54,AT THE CLARENDON PRESS,"would destroy the original form of the Lecture, while a slight expansion"
55,AT THE CLARENDON PRESS,would do little to provide against misunderstandings.

63,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
64,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
65,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"One who, after twenty years, is restored to the University where he was"
66,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"taught and first tried to teach, and who has received at the hands of"
67,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"his Alma Mater an honour of which he never dreamed, is tempted to speak"
68,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,both of himself and of her. But I remember that you have come to listen
69,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"to my thoughts about a great subject, and not to my feelings about"
70,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"myself; and, of Oxford, who that holds this Professorship could dare to"
71,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"speak, when he recalls the exquisite verse in which one of his"
72,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"predecessors described her beauty, and the prose in which he gently"
73,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,touched on her illusions and protested that they were as nothing when
74,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"set against her age-long warfare with the Philistine? How, again,"
75,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"remembering him and others, should I venture to praise my predecessors?"
76,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"It would be pleasant to do so, and even pleasanter to me and you if,"
77,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"instead of lecturing, I quoted to you some of their best passages. But I"
78,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"could not do this for five years. Sooner or later, my own words would"
79,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"have to come, and the inevitable contrast. Not to sharpen it now, I will"
80,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,be silent concerning them also; and will only assure you that I do not
81,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"forget them, or the greatness of the honour of succeeding them, or the"
82,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,responsibility which it entails.
83,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
84,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,Since I left Oxford one change has taken place in its educational
85,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,system which may be thought to affect the Professorship of Poetry. A
86,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"School of English Language and Literature has been founded, and has"
87,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,attracted a fair number of candidates. Naturally I rejoice in this
88,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"change, knowing from experience the value of these studies; and knowing"
89,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"also from experience, if I may speak boldly, how idle is that dream"
90,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,which flits about in Oxford and whispers that the mastering of Old
91,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"English, on the basis of Teutonic phonology, and the conquest of the"
92,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,worlds opened by Chaucer and Shakespeare and Swift and Burke and twenty
93,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"more, is a business too slight and a discipline not severe enough for"
94,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"undergraduates. I should be glad to lighten their labours, and, if it"
95,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"should seem advisable to those who can judge, I propose to give in one"
96,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"of the three Terms of the year, in addition to my statutory lecture, a"
97,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,few others intended specially for those who are reading for the School
98,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"of English. I wish I could do more, but I resigned my chair in Glasgow"
99,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"with a view to work of another kind, and I could not have parted from my"
100,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"students there, to whom I am bound by ties of the most grateful"
101,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"affection, in order to take up similar duties even in the University of"
102,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,Oxford.
103,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
104,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"The charming poem with which my predecessor opened his literary career,"
105,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"and his admirable contributions to poetical history and criticism, prove"
106,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,that it would have been easy to him to devote his lectures to the
107,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"interpretation of particular poets and poems. I believe, however, that"
108,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,he thought it better to confine himself chiefly to questions in Poetics
109,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"or Aesthetics. I can well understand his choice; but, partly because he"
110,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"made it, I propose to make another, and to discuss these questions, if"
111,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"at all, only as they are illustrated by particular writers and works."
112,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,Still in an inaugural lecture it is customary to take some wider
113,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,subject; and so I fear you may have to-day to lament the truth of
114,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,Addison's remark: 'There is nothing in nature so irksome as general
115,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"discourses, especially when they turn chiefly upon words.' Mine turns"
116,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,entirely upon words.
117,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
118,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,[Sidenote: POETRY]
119,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
120,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,The words 'Poetry for poetry's sake' recall the famous phrase 'Art for
121,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,Art.' It is far from my purpose to examine the possible meanings of that
122,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"phrase, or all the questions it involves. I propose to state briefly"
123,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"what I understand by 'Poetry for poetry's sake,' and then, after"
124,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"guarding against one or two misapprehensions of the formula, to consider"
125,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"more fully a single problem connected with it. And I must premise,"
126,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"without attempting to justify them, certain explanations. We are to"
127,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"consider poetry in its essence, and apart from the flaws which in most"
128,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,poems accompany their poetry. We are to include in the idea of poetry
129,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"the metrical form, and not to regard this as a mere accident or a mere"
130,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"vehicle. And, finally, poetry being poems, we are to think of a poem as"
131,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"it actually exists; and, without aiming here at accuracy, we may say"
132,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"that an actual poem is the succession of experiences--sounds, images,"
133,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"thoughts, emotions--through which we pass when we are reading as"
134,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,poetically as we can. Of course this imaginative experience--if I may
135,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,use the phrase for brevity--differs with every reader and every time of
136,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,reading: a poem exists in innumerable degrees. But that insurmountable
137,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,fact lies in the nature of things and does not concern us now.
138,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
139,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,What then does the formula 'Poetry for poetry's sake' tell us about this
140,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"experience? It says, as I understand it, these things. First, this"
141,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"experience is an end in itself, is worth having on its own account, has"
142,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"an intrinsic value. Next, its _poetic_ value is this intrinsic worth alone."
143,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,Poetry may have also an ulterior value as a means to culture or
144,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"religion; because it conveys instruction, or softens the passions, or"
145,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,furthers a good cause; because it brings the poet fame or money or a
146,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,quiet conscience. So much the better: let it be valued for these reasons
147,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,too. But its ulterior worth neither is nor can directly determine its
148,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,poetic worth as a satisfying imaginative experience; and this is to be
149,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,judged entirely from within. And to these two positions the formula
150,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"would add, though not of necessity, a third. The consideration of"
151,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"ulterior ends, whether by the poet in the act of composing or by the"
152,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"reader in the act of experiencing, tends to lower poetic value. It does"
153,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,so because it tends to change the nature of poetry by taking it out of
154,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"its own atmosphere. For its nature is to be not a part, nor yet a copy,"
155,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"of the real world (as we commonly understand that phrase), but to be a"
156,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"world by itself, independent, complete, autonomous; and to possess it"
157,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"fully you must enter that world, conform to its laws, and ignore for the"
158,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"time the beliefs, aims, and particular conditions which belong to you in"
159,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,the other world of reality.
160,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
161,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,[Sidenote: POETIC VALUE INTRINSIC]
162,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
163,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,Of the more serious misapprehensions to which these statements may give
164,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,rise I will glance only at one or two. The offensive consequences often
165,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,drawn from the formula 'Art for Art' will be found to attach not to the
166,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"doctrine that Art is an end in itself, but to the doctrine that Art is"
167,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"the whole or supreme end of human life. And as this latter doctrine,"
168,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"which seems to me absurd, is in any case quite different from the"
169,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"former, its consequences fall outside my subject. The formula 'Poetry is"
170,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,an end in itself' has nothing to say on the many questions of moral
171,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,judgement which arise from the fact that poetry has its place in a
172,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"many-sided life. For anything it says, the intrinsic value of poetry"
173,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"might be so small, and its ulterior effects so mischievous, that it had"
174,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,better not exist. The formula only tells us that we must not place in
175,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"antithesis poetry and human good, for poetry is one kind of human good;"
176,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,and that we must not determine the intrinsic value of this kind of good
177,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"by direct reference to another. If we do, we shall find ourselves"
178,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,maintaining what we did not expect. If poetic value lies in the
179,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"stimulation of religious feelings, _Lead, kindly Light_ is no better a"
180,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,poem than many a tasteless version of a Psalm: if in the excitement of
181,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"patriotism, why is _Scots, wha hae_ superior to _We don't want to"
182,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"fight_? if in the mitigation of the passions, the Odes of Sappho will"
183,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"win but little praise: if in instruction, Armstrong's _Art of preserving"
184,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,Health_ should win much.
185,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
186,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"Again, our formula may be accused of cutting poetry away from its"
187,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,connexion with life. And this accusation raises so huge a problem that I
188,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,must ask leave to be dogmatic as well as brief. There is plenty of
189,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"connexion between life and poetry, but it is, so to say, a connexion"
190,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,underground. The two may be called different forms of the same thing:
191,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"one of them having (in the usual sense) reality, but seldom fully"
192,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,satisfying imagination; while the other offers something which satisfies
193,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,imagination but has not (in the usual sense) full reality. They are
194,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"parallel developments which nowhere meet, or, if I may use incorrectly a"
195,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"word which will be useful later, they are analogues. Hence we understand"
196,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"one by help of the other, and even, in a sense, care for one because of"
197,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"the other; but hence also, poetry neither is life, nor, strictly"
198,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"speaking, a copy of it. They differ not only because one has more mass"
199,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,and the other a more perfect shape; but they have different _kinds_ of
200,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,existence. The one touches us as beings occupying a given position in
201,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"space and time, and having feelings, desires, and purposes due to that"
202,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"position: it appeals to imagination, but appeals to much besides. What"
203,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,meets us in poetry has not a position in the same series of time and
204,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"space, or, if it has or had such a position, is taken apart from much"
205,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,that belonged to it there; and therefore it makes no direct appeal to
206,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"those feelings, desires, and purposes, but speaks only to contemplative"
207,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"imagination--imagination the reverse of empty or emotionless,"
208,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"imagination saturated with the results of 'real' experience, but still"
209,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"contemplative. Thus, no doubt, one main reason why poetry has poetic"
210,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,value for us is that it presents to us in its own way something which we
211,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,meet in another form in nature or life; and yet the test of its poetic
212,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"value lies simply in the question whether it satisfies our imagination,"
213,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"the rest of us, our knowledge or conscience, for example, judging it"
214,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,only so far as they appear transmuted in our imagination. So also
215,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"Shakespeare's knowledge or his moral insight, Milton's greatness of"
216,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"soul, Shelley's 'hate of hate' and 'love of love,' and that desire to"
217,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"help men by his poetry which influenced this poet or that--not, surely,"
218,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,in the process of composition but in hours of meditation--all these
219,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"have, as such, no poetical worth: they have that worth only when,"
220,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"passing through the unity of the poet's being, they reappear as"
221,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"qualities of imagination, and then are indeed mighty powers in the world"
222,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,of poetry.
223,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
224,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"I come to a third misapprehension, and so to my main subject. This"
225,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"formula, it is said, empties poetry of its meaning: it is really a"
226,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,doctrine of form for form's sake.
227,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
228,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,[Sidenote: WHERE DOES IT LIE?]
229,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
230,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"'It matters not what a poet says, so long as he says the thing well. The"
231,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"_what_ is poetically indifferent: it is the _how_ that counts. Matter,"
232,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"subject, content, substance, determines nothing; there is no subject"
233,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"with which poetry may not deal: the form, the treatment, is everything."
234,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"Nay, more: not only is the matter indifferent, but it is the secret of"
235,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"Art to ""eradicate the matter by means of the form.""' Phrases and"
236,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,statements like these meet us everywhere in current criticism of
237,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,literature and the other arts. They are the stock-in-trade of writers
238,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,who understand of them little more than the fact that somehow or other
239,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,they are not 'bourgeois.' But we find them also seriously used by
240,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"writers whom we must respect, whether they are anonymous or not;"
241,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"something like one or another of them might be quoted, for example, from"
242,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"Professor Saintsbury, the late R. A. M. Stevenson, Schiller, Goethe"
243,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,himself; and they are the watchwords of a school in the one country
244,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"where Aesthetics has flourished. They come, as a rule, from men who"
245,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"either practise one of the arts, or, from study of it, are interested in"
246,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,its methods. The general reader--a being so general that I may say what
247,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,I will of him--is outraged by them. He feels that he is being robbed of
248,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"almost all that he cares for in a work of art. 'You are asking me,' he"
249,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"says, 'to look at the Dresden Madonna as if it were a Persian rug. You"
250,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,are telling me that the poetic value of _Hamlet_ lies solely in its
251,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"style and versification, and that my interest in the man and his fate is"
252,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"only an intellectual or moral interest. You pretend that, if I want to"
253,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"enjoy the poetry of _Crossing the Bar_, I must not mind what Tennyson"
254,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"says there, but must consider solely how he says it. But in that case I"
255,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,can care no more for a poem than I do for a set of nonsense verses; and
256,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,I do not believe that the authors of _Hamlet_ and _Crossing the Bar_
257,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,regarded their poems thus.'
258,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
259,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"These antitheses of subject, matter, substance on the one side, form,"
260,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"treatment, handling on the other, are the field through which I"
261,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"especially want, in this lecture, to indicate a way. It is a field of"
262,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,battle; and the battle is waged for no trivial cause; but the cries of
263,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,the combatants are terribly ambiguous. Those phrases of the so-called
264,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"formalist may each mean five or six different things. If they mean one,"
265,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,they seem to me chiefly true; taken as the general reader not
266,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"unnaturally takes them, they seem to me false and mischievous. It would"
267,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,be absurd to pretend that I can end in a few minutes a controversy which
268,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"concerns the ultimate nature of Art, and leads perhaps to problems not"
269,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"yet soluble; but we can at least draw some plain distinctions which, in"
270,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"this controversy, are too often confused."
271,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
272,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"In the first place, then, let us take 'subject' in one particular sense;"
273,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"let us understand by it that which we have in view when, looking at the"
274,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"title of a poem, we say that the poet has chosen this or that for his"
275,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"subject. The subject, in this sense, so far as I can discover, is"
276,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"generally something, real or imaginary, as it exists in the minds of"
277,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,fairly cultivated people. The subject of _Paradise Lost_ would be the
278,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,story of the Fall as that story exists in the general imagination of a
279,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,Bible-reading people. The subject of Shelley's stanzas _To a Skylark_
280,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"would be the ideas which arise in the mind of an educated person when,"
281,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"without knowing the poem, he hears the word 'skylark.' If the title of a"
282,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"poem conveys little or nothing to us, the 'subject' appears to be"
283,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,either what we should gather by investigating the title in a dictionary
284,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"or other book of the kind, or else such a brief suggestion as might be"
285,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"offered by a person who had read the poem, and who said, for example,"
286,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,that the subject of _The Ancient Mariner_ was a sailor who killed an
287,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,albatross and suffered for his deed.
288,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
289,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,[Sidenote: VALUE NOT IN SUBJECT]
290,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
291,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"Now the subject, in this sense (and I intend to use the word in no"
292,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"other), is not, as such, inside the poem, but outside it. The contents"
293,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,of the stanzas _To a Skylark_ are not the ideas suggested by the word
294,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,'skylark' to the average man; they belong to Shelley just as much as the
295,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"language does. The subject, therefore, is not the matter _of_ the poem"
296,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"at all; and its opposite is not the _form_ of the poem, but the whole"
297,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"poem. The subject is one thing; the poem, matter and form alike, another"
298,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"thing. This being so, it is surely obvious that the poetic value cannot"
299,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"lie in the subject, but lies entirely in its opposite, the poem. How can"
300,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,the subject determine the value when on one and the same subject poems
301,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,may be written of all degrees of merit and demerit; or when a perfect
302,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"poem may be composed on a subject so slight as a pet sparrow, and, if"
303,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"Macaulay may be trusted, a nearly worthless poem on a subject so"
304,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,stupendous as the omnipresence of the Deity? The 'formalist' is here
305,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,perfectly right. Nor is he insisting on something unimportant. He is
306,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,contending against our tendency to take the work of art as a mere copy
307,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"or reminder of something already in our heads, or at the best as a"
308,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,suggestion of some idea as little removed as possible from the familiar.
309,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"The sightseer who promenades a picture-gallery, remarking that this"
310,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"portrait is so like his cousin, or that landscape the very image of his"
311,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"birthplace, or who, after satisfying himself that one picture is about"
312,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"Elijah, passes on rejoicing to discover the subject, and nothing but the"
313,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"subject, of the next--what is he but an extreme example of this"
314,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"tendency? Well, but the very same tendency vitiates much of our"
315,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"criticism, much criticism of Shakespeare, for example, which, with all"
316,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"its cleverness and partial truth, still shows that the critic never"
317,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,passed from his own mind into Shakespeare's; and it may still be traced
318,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"even in so fine a critic as Coleridge, as when he dwarfs the sublime"
319,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,struggle of Hamlet into the image of his own unhappy weakness. Hazlitt
320,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"by no means escaped its influence. Only the third of that great trio,"
321,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"Lamb, appears almost always to have rendered the conception of the"
322,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,composer.
323,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
324,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"Again, it is surely true that we cannot determine beforehand what"
325,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"subjects are fit for Art, or name any subject on which a good poem might"
326,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"not possibly be written. To divide subjects into two groups, the"
327,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"beautiful or elevating, and the ugly or vicious, and to judge poems"
328,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"according as their subjects belong to one of these groups or the other,"
329,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"is to fall into the same pit, to confuse with our pre-conceptions the"
330,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,meaning of the poet. What the thing is in the poem he is to be judged
331,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"by, not by the thing as it was before he touched it; and how can we"
332,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,venture to say beforehand that he cannot make a true poem out of
333,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,something which to us was merely alluring or dull or revolting? The
334,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"question whether, having done so, he ought to publish his poem; whether"
335,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,the thing in the poet's work will not be still confused by the
336,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,incompetent Puritan or the incompetent sensualist with the thing in
337,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"_his_ mind, does not touch this point; it is a further question, one of"
338,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"ethics, not of art. No doubt the upholders of 'Art for art's sake' will"
339,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"generally be in favour of the courageous course, of refusing to"
340,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,sacrifice the better or stronger part of the public to the weaker or
341,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,worse; but their maxim in no way binds them to this view. Dante Rossetti
342,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"suppressed one of the best of his sonnets, a sonnet chosen for"
343,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"admiration by Tennyson, himself extremely sensitive about the moral"
344,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"effect of poetry; suppressed it, I believe, because it was called"
345,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,fleshly. One may regret Rossetti's judgement and at the same time admire
346,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,his scrupulousness; but in any case he judged in his capacity of
347,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"citizen, not in his capacity of artist."
348,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
349,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,[Sidenote: SUBJECT NOT INDIFFERENT]
350,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
351,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"So far then the 'formalist' appears to be right. But he goes too far, I"
352,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"think, if he maintains that the subject is indifferent and that all"
353,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,subjects are the same to poetry. And he does not prove his point by
354,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"observing that a good poem might be written on a pin's head, and a bad"
355,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"one on the Fall of Man. That shows that the subject _settles_ nothing,"
356,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,but not that it counts for nothing. The Fall of Man is really a more
357,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"favourable subject than a pin's head. The Fall of Man, that is to say,"
358,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,offers opportunities of poetic effects wider in range and more
359,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"penetrating in appeal. And the truth is that such a subject, as it"
360,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"exists in the general imagination, has some aesthetic value before the"
361,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"poet touches it. It is, as you may choose to call it, an inchoate poem"
362,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,or the débris of a poem. It is not an abstract idea or a bare isolated
363,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"fact, but an assemblage of figures, scenes, actions, and events, which"
364,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,already appeal to emotional imagination; and it is already in some
365,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,degree organized and formed. In spite of this a bad poet would make a
366,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,bad poem on it; but then we should say he was unworthy of the subject.
367,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,And we should not say this if he wrote a bad poem on a pin's head.
368,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"Conversely, a good poem on a pin's head would almost certainly"
369,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,revolutionize its subject far more than a good poem on the Fall of Man.
370,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"It might transform its subject so completely that we should say, 'The"
371,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"subject may be a pin's head, but the substance of the poem has very"
372,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,little to do with it.'
373,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
374,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"This brings us to another and different antithesis. Those figures,"
375,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"scenes, events, that form part of the subject called the Fall of Man,"
376,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,are not the substance of _Paradise Lost_; but in _Paradise Lost_ there
377,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"are figures, scenes, and events resembling them in some degree. These,"
378,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"with much more of the same kind, may be described as its substance, and"
379,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"may then be contrasted with the measured language of the poem, which"
380,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,will be called its form. Subject is the opposite not of form but of the
381,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"whole poem. Substance is within the poem, and its opposite, form, is"
382,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"also within the poem. I am not criticizing this antithesis at present,"
383,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,but evidently it is quite different from the other. It is practically
384,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"the distinction used in the old-fashioned criticism of epic and drama,"
385,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"and it flows down, not unsullied, from Aristotle. Addison, for example,"
386,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"in examining _Paradise Lost_ considers in order the fable, the"
387,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"characters, and the sentiments; these will be the substance: then he"
388,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"considers the language, that is, the style and numbers; this will be the"
389,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"form. In like manner, the substance or meaning of a lyric may be"
390,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,distinguished from the form.
391,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
392,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,[Sidenote: SUBSTANCE AND FORM]
393,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
394,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,Now I believe it will be found that a large part of the controversy we
395,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,are dealing with arises from a confusion between these two distinctions
396,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"of substance and form, and of subject and poem. The extreme formalist"
397,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,lays his whole weight on the form because he thinks its opposite is the
398,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"mere subject. The general reader is angry, but makes the same mistake,"
399,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,and gives to the subject praises that rightly belong to the
400,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,substance[1]. I will read an example of what I mean. I can only explain
401,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,the following words of a good critic by supposing that for the moment he
402,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"has fallen into this confusion: 'The mere matter of all poetry--to wit,"
403,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,the appearances of nature and the thoughts and feelings of men--being
404,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"unalterable, it follows that the difference between poet and poet will"
405,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"depend upon the manner of each in applying language, metre, rhyme,"
406,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"cadence, and what not, to this invariable material.' What has become"
407,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"here of the substance of _Paradise Lost_--the story, scenery,"
408,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"characters, sentiments as they are in the poem? They have vanished clean"
409,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"away. Nothing is left but the form on one side, and on the other not"
410,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"even the subject, but a supposed invariable material, the appearances of"
411,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,nature and the thoughts and feelings of men. Is it surprising that the
412,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,whole value should then be found in the form?
413,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
414,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,So far we have assumed that this antithesis of substance and form is
415,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"valid, and that it always has one meaning. In reality it has several,"
416,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"but we will leave it in its present shape, and pass to the question of"
417,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"its validity. And this question we are compelled to raise, because we"
418,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,have to deal with the two contentions that the poetic value lies wholly
419,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"or mainly in the substance, and that it lies wholly or mainly in the"
420,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"form. Now these contentions, whether false or true, may seem at least to"
421,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"be clear; but we shall find, I think, that they are both of them false,"
422,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,or both of them nonsense: false if they concern anything outside the
423,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"poem, nonsense if they apply to something in it. For what do they"
424,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"evidently imply? They imply that there are in a poem two parts, factors,"
425,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"or components, a substance and a form; and that you can conceive them"
426,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"distinctly and separately, so that when you are speaking of the one you"
427,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"are not speaking of the other. Otherwise how can you ask the question,"
428,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"In which of them does the value lie? But really in a poem, apart from"
429,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"defects, there are no such factors or components; and therefore it is"
430,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,strictly nonsense to ask in which of them the value lies. And on the
431,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"other hand, if the substance and the form referred to are not in the"
432,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"poem, then both the contentions are false, for its poetic value lies in"
433,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,itself.
434,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
435,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,[Sidenote: IDENTITY OF SUBSTANCE AND FORM]
436,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
437,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"What I mean is neither new nor mysterious; and it will be clear, I"
438,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"believe, to any one who reads poetry poetically and who closely examines"
439,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"his experience. When you are reading a poem, I would ask--not analysing"
440,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"it, and much less criticizing it, but allowing it, as it proceeds, to"
441,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,make its full impression on you through the exertion of your re-creating
442,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,imagination--do you then apprehend and enjoy as one thing a certain
443,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"meaning or substance, and as another thing certain articulate sounds,"
444,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"and do you somehow compound these two? Surely you do not, any more than"
445,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"you apprehend apart, when you see some one smile, those lines in the"
446,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"face which express a feeling, and the feeling that the lines express."
447,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"Just as there the lines and their meaning are to you one thing, not two,"
448,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"so in poetry the meaning and the sounds are one: there is, if I may put"
449,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"it so, a resonant meaning, or a meaning resonance. If you read the line,"
450,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"'The sun is warm, the sky is clear,' you do not experience separately"
451,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"the image of a warm sun and clear sky, on the one side, and certain"
452,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,unintelligible rhythmical sounds on the other; nor yet do you experience
453,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"them together, side by side; but you experience the one _in_ the other."
454,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"And in like manner when you are really reading _Hamlet_, the action and"
455,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,the characters are not something which you conceive apart from the
456,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,words; you apprehend them from point to point _in_ the words.
457,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"Afterwards, no doubt, when you are out of the poetic experience, but"
458,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"remember it, you may by analysis decompose this unity, and attend to a"
459,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"substance more or less isolated, and a form more or less isolated. But"
460,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"these are things in your analytic head, not in the poem, which is"
461,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"_poetic_ experience. And if you want to have the poem again, you cannot"
462,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,find it by adding together these two products of decomposition; you can
463,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,only find it by passing back into poetic experience. And then what you
464,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"have again is no aggregate of factors, it is a unity in which you can no"
465,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,more separate a substance and a form than you can separate living blood
466,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"and the life in the blood. This unity has, if you like, various"
467,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"'aspects' or 'sides,' but they are not factors or parts; if you try to"
468,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"examine one, you find it is also the other. Call them substance and form"
469,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"if you please, but these are not the reciprocally exclusive substance"
470,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"and form to which the two contentions _must_ refer. They do not 'agree,'"
471,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,for they are not apart: they are one thing from different points of
472,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"view, and in that sense identical. And this identity of content and"
473,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"form, you will say, is no accident; it is of the essence of poetry in so"
474,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"far as it is poetry, and of all art in so far as it is art. Just as"
475,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"there is in music not sound on one side and a meaning on the other, but"
476,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"expressive sound, and if you ask what is the meaning you can only"
477,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,answer by pointing to the sounds; just as in painting there is not a
478,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"meaning _plus_ paint, but a meaning _in_ paint, or significant paint,"
479,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,and no man can really express the meaning in any other way than in paint
480,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,and in _this_ paint; so in a poem the true content and the true form
481,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,neither exist nor can be imagined apart. When then you are asked whether
482,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,the value of a poem lies in a substance got by decomposing the poem and
483,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"present, as such, only in reflective analysis, or in a form arrived at"
484,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"and existing in the same way, you will answer, 'It lies neither in one,"
485,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"nor in the other, nor in any addition of them, but in the poem, where"
486,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,they are not.' And when you are told that you are talking _a priori_
487,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"metaphysics, you will not mind. 'Metaphysics' does not mean anything. It"
488,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,is only a term of abuse applied to the effort to look at facts instead
489,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,of repeating _a priori_ fictions.
490,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
491,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"We have then, first, an antithesis of subject and poem. This is clear"
492,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,and valid; and the question in which of them does the value lie is
493,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"intelligible; and its answer is, In the poem. We have next a distinction"
494,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"of substance and form. If the substance means ideas, images, and the"
495,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"like taken alone, and the form means the measured language taken by"
496,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"itself, this is a possible distinction, but it is a distinction of"
497,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"things not in the poem, and the value lies in neither of them. If"
498,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"substance and form mean anything _in_ the poem, then each is involved in"
499,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"the other, and the question in which of them the value lies has no"
500,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"sense. No doubt you may say, speaking loosely and perilously, that in"
501,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"this poet or poem the aspect of substance is the more noticeable, and in"
502,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"that the aspect of form, and you may pursue interesting discussions on"
503,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,this basis: but no principle or ultimate question of value is touched by
504,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"them. And apart from that question, of course, I am not denying the"
505,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,usefulness and necessity of the distinction. We cannot dispense with it.
506,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"To consider separately the action or the characters of a play, and"
507,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"separately its style or versification, is both legitimate and valuable,"
508,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,so long as we remember what we are doing. But the true critic in
509,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"speaking of these apart never really thinks of them apart; the whole,"
510,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"the poetic experience, of which they are but aspects, is always in his"
511,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"mind; and he is always aiming at a richer, truer, more intense"
512,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"repetition of that experience. On the other hand, when the question of"
513,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"principle, of poetic value, is raised, these aspects _must_ fall apart"
514,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"into components, separately conceivable; and then there arise two"
515,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"heresies, equally false, that the value lies in one of two things, both"
516,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,of which are outside the poem where its value cannot lie.
517,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
518,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,[Sidenote: SUBSTANCE]
519,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
520,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,On the heresy of the separable substance a few additional words will
521,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"suffice. This heresy is seldom formulated, but perhaps some unconscious"
522,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,holder of it may object: 'Surely the action and the characters of
523,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"_Hamlet_ are in the play; and surely I can retain these, though I have"
524,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"forgotten all the words. I admit that I do not possess the whole poem,"
525,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"but I possess a part, and the most important part.' And I would answer:"
526,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"'If we are not concerned with any question of principle, I accept all"
527,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"that you say except the last words, which do raise such a question."
528,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"Speaking loosely, I agree that the action and characters, as you perhaps"
529,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"conceive them, together with a great deal more, are in the poem. Even"
530,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"then, however, you must not claim to possess all of this kind that is in"
531,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,the poem; for in forgetting the words you must have lost innumerable
532,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"details of the action and the characters. And, when the question of"
533,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"value is raised, I must insist that the action and characters, as you"
534,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"conceive them, are not in _Hamlet_ at all. If they are, point them out."
535,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,You cannot do it. What you find at any moment of that succession of
536,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"experiences called _Hamlet_ is words. In these words, to speak loosely"
537,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"again, the action and characters (more of them than you can conceive"
538,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"apart) are focussed; but your experience is not a combination of them,"
539,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"as ideas, on the one side, with certain sounds on the other; it is an"
540,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,experience of something in which the two are indissolubly fused. If you
541,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"deny this, to be sure I can make no answer, or can only answer that I"
542,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"have reason to believe that you cannot read poetically, or else are"
543,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"misinterpreting your experience. But if you do not deny this, then you"
544,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"will admit that the action and characters of the poem, as you separately"
545,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"imagine them, are no part of it, but a product of it in your reflective"
546,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"imagination, a faint analogue of one aspect of it taken in detachment"
547,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"from the whole. Well, I do not deny, I would even insist, that, in the"
548,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"case of so long a poem as _Hamlet_, it may be necessary from time to"
549,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"time to interrupt the poetic experience, in order to enrich it by"
550,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"forming such a product and dwelling on it. Nor, in a wide sense of"
551,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"""poetic,"" do I question the poetic value of this product, as you think"
552,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,of it apart from the poem. It resembles our recollections of the heroes
553,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"of history or legend, who move about in our imaginations, ""forms more"
554,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"real than living man,"" and are worth much to us though we do not"
555,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"remember anything they said. Our ideas and images of the ""substance"" of"
556,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"a poem have this poetic value, and more, if they are at all adequate."
557,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"But they cannot determine the poetic value of the poem, for (not to"
558,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"speak of the competing claims of the ""form"") nothing that is outside"
559,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"the poem can do that, and they, as such, are outside it[2].'"

561,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,[Sidenote: STYLE]
562,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
563,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,Let us turn to the so-called form--style and versification. There is no
564,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,such thing as mere form in poetry. All form is expression. Style may
565,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,have indeed a certain aesthetic worth in partial abstraction from the
566,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"particular matter it conveys, as in a well-built sentence you may take"
567,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,pleasure in the build almost apart from the meaning. Even then style is
568,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"expressive--presents to sense, for example, the order, ease, and"
569,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,rapidity with which ideas move in the writer's mind--but it is not
570,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,expressive of the meaning of that particular sentence. And it is
571,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"possible, interrupting poetic experience, to decompose it and abstract"
572,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,for comparatively separate consideration this nearly formal element of
573,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,style. But the aesthetic value of style so taken is not considerable;
574,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,you could not read with pleasure for an hour a composition which had no
575,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,other merit. And in poetic experience you never apprehend this value by
576,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"itself; the style is here expressive also of a particular meaning, or"
577,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,rather is one aspect of that unity whose other aspect is meaning. So
578,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,that what you apprehend may be called indifferently an expressed meaning
579,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,or a significant form. Perhaps on this point I may in Oxford appeal to
580,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"authority, that of Matthew Arnold and Walter Pater, the latter at any"
581,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,rate an authority whom the formalist will not despise. What is the gist
582,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"of Pater's teaching about style, if it is not that in the end the one"
583,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"virtue of style is truth or adequacy; that the word, phrase, sentence,"
584,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"should express perfectly the writer's perception, feeling, image, or"
585,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"thought; so that, as we read a descriptive phrase of Keats's, we"
586,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"exclaim, 'That is the thing itself'; so that, to quote Arnold, the words"
587,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"are 'symbols equivalent with the thing symbolized,' or, in our technical"
588,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"language, a form identical with its content? Hence in true poetry it is,"
589,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"in strictness, impossible to express the meaning in any but its own"
590,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"words, or to change the words without changing the meaning. A"
591,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,translation of such poetry is not really the old meaning in a fresh
592,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"dress; it is a new product, something like the poem, though, if one"
593,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"chooses to say so, more like it in the aspect of meaning than in the"
594,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,aspect of form.
595,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
596,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"No one who understands poetry, it seems to me, would dispute this, were"
597,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"it not that, falling away from his experience, or misled by theory, he"
598,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,takes the word 'meaning' in a sense almost ludicrously inapplicable to
599,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"poetry. People say, for instance, 'steed' and 'horse' have the same"
600,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"meaning; and in bad poetry they have, but not in poetry that _is_"
601,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,poetry.
602,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
603,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,'Bring forth the horse!' The horse was brought:
604,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,In truth he was a noble steed!
605,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
606,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"says Byron in _Mazeppa_. If the two words mean the same here, transpose"
607,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,them:
608,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
609,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,'Bring forth the steed!' The steed was brought:
610,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,In truth he was a noble horse!
611,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
612,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,and ask again if they mean the same. Or let me take a line certainly
613,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,very free from 'poetic diction':
614,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
615,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"To be or not to be, that is the question."
616,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
617,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,You may say that this means the same as 'What is just now occupying my
618,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,attention is the comparative disadvantages of continuing to live or
619,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"putting an end to myself.' And for practical purposes--the purpose, for"
620,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"example, of a coroner--it does. But as the second version altogether"
621,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"misrepresents the speaker at that moment of his existence, while the"
622,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"first does represent him, how can they for any but a practical or"
623,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,logical purpose be said to have the same sense? Hamlet was well able to
624,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"'unpack his heart with words,' but he will not unpack it with our"
625,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,paraphrases.
626,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
627,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,[Sidenote: VERSIFICATION]
628,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
629,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,These considerations apply equally to versification. If I take the
630,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,famous line which describes how the souls of the dead stood waiting by
631,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"the river, imploring a passage from Charon:"
632,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
633,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"Tendebantque manus ripae ulterioris amore,"
634,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
635,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"and if I translate it, 'and were stretching forth their hands in longing"
636,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"for the further bank,' the charm of the original has fled. Why has it"
637,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,fled? Partly (but we have dealt with that) because I have substituted
638,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"for five words, and those the words of Virgil, twelve words, and those"
639,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,my own. In some measure because I have turned into rhythmless prose a
640,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"line of verse which, as mere sound, has unusual beauty. But much more"
641,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,because in doing so I have also changed the _meaning_ of Virgil's line.
642,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,What that meaning is _I_ cannot say: Virgil has said it. But I can see
643,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"this much, that the translation conveys a far less vivid picture of the"
644,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"outstretched hands and of their remaining outstretched, and a far less"
645,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,poignant sense of the distance of the shore and the longing of the
646,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,souls. And it does so partly because this picture and this sense are
647,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"conveyed not only by the obvious meaning of the words, but through the"
648,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"long-drawn sound of 'Tendebantque,' through the time occupied by the"
649,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"five syllables and therefore by the idea of 'ulterioris,' and through"
650,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,the identity of the long sound 'or' in the penultimate syllables of
651,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"'ulterioris amore'--all this, and much more, apprehended not in this"
652,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"analytical fashion, nor as _added_ to the beauty of mere sound and to"
653,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"the obvious meaning, but in unity with them and so as expressive of the"
654,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,poetic meaning of the whole.
655,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
656,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"It is always so in fine poetry. The value of versification, when it is"
657,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"indissolubly fused with meaning, can hardly be exaggerated. The gift for"
658,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"feeling it, even more perhaps than the gift for feeling the value of"
659,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"diction, is the _specific_ gift for poetry, as distinguished from other"
660,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"arts. But versification, taken, as far as possible, all by itself, has a"
661,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"very different worth. Some aesthetic worth it has; how much, you may"
662,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,experience by reading poetry in a language of which you do not
663,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"understand a syllable. The pleasure is quite appreciable, but it is not"
664,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"great; nor in actual poetic experience do you meet with it, as such, at"
665,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,all. For it is not _added_ to the pleasure of the meaning when you read
666,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,poetry that you do understand: by some mystery the music is then the
667,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"music _of_ the meaning, and the two are one. However fond of"
668,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"versification you might be, you would tire very soon of reading verses"
669,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,in Chinese; and before long of reading Virgil and Dante if you were
670,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"ignorant of their languages. But take the music as it is _in_ the poem,"
671,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,and there is a marvellous change. Now
672,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
673,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,It gives a very echo to the seat
674,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,Where Love is throned;
675,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
676,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"or 'carries far into your heart,' almost like music itself, the sound"
677,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
678,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"Of old, unhappy, far-off things"
679,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,And battles long ago.
680,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
681,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,What then is to be said of the following sentence of the critic quoted
682,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,before: 'But when any one who knows what poetry is reads--
683,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
684,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,Our noisy years seem moments in the being
685,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"Of the eternal silence,"
686,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
687,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"he sees that, quite independently of the meaning, ... there is one note"
688,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,added to the articulate music of the world--a note that never will leave
689,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,off resounding till the eternal silence itself gulfs it'? I must think
690,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,that the writer is deceiving himself. For I could quite understand his
691,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"enthusiasm, if it were an enthusiasm for the music of the meaning; but"
692,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"as for the music, 'quite independently of the meaning,' so far as I can"
693,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"hear it thus (and I doubt if any one who knows English can quite do so),"
694,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"I find it gives some pleasure, but only a trifling pleasure. And indeed"
695,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"I venture to doubt whether, considered as mere sound, the words are at"
696,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"all exceptionally beautiful, as Virgil's line certainly is. Whatever may"
697,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"be the consequence, I would back against them, 'quite independently of"
698,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"the meaning,' this once famous stanza:"
699,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
700,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"Where is Cupid's crimson motion,"
701,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,Billowy ecstasy of woe?
702,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"Bear me straight, meandering ocean,"
703,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,Where the stagnant torrents flow.
704,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
705,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,[Sidenote: IMPERFECT UNITY]
706,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
707,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"When poetry answers to its idea and is purely or almost purely poetic,"
708,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,we find the identity of form and content; and the degree of purity
709,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,attained may be tested by the degree in which we feel it hopeless to
710,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,convey the effect of a poem or passage in any form but its own. Where
711,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"the notion of doing so is simply ludicrous, you have quintessential"
712,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"poetry. But a great part even of good poetry, especially in long works,"
713,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,is of a mixed nature; and so we find in it no more than a partial
714,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,agreement of a form and substance which remain to some extent distinct.
715,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,This is so in many passages of Shakespeare (the greatest of poets when
716,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"he chose, but not always a conscientious poet); passages where something"
717,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"was wanted for the sake of the plot, but he did not care about it or was"
718,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,hurried. The conception of the passage is then distinct from the
719,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"execution, and neither is inspired. This is so also, I think, wherever"
720,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,we can truly speak of merely decorative effect. We seem to perceive that
721,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"the poet had a truth or fact--philosophical, agricultural,"
722,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"social--distinctly before him, and then, as we say, clothed it in"
723,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"metrical and coloured language. Most argumentative, didactic, or satiric"
724,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,poems are partly of this kind; and in imaginative poems anything which
725,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,is really a mere 'conceit' is mere decoration. We often deceive
726,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"ourselves in this matter, for what we call decoration has often a new"
727,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,and genuinely poetic content of its own; but wherever there is mere
728,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"decoration, we judge the poetry to be not wholly poetic. And so when"
729,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"Wordsworth inveighed against poetic diction, though he hurled his darts"
730,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"rather wildly, what he was rightly aiming at was a phraseology, not the"
731,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"living body of a new content, but the mere worn-out body of an old one."
732,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
733,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,In pure poetry it is otherwise. Pure poetry is not the decoration of a
734,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,preconceived and clearly defined matter: it springs from the creative
735,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,impulse of a vague imaginative mass pressing for development and
736,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"definition. If the poet already knew exactly what he meant to say, why"
737,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,should he write the poem? The poem would in fact already be written. For
738,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"only its completion can reveal, even to him, exactly what he wanted."
739,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"When he began and while he was at work, he did not possess his meaning;"
740,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,it possessed him. It was not a fully formed soul asking for a body: it
741,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,was an inchoate soul in the inchoate body of perhaps two or three vague
742,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,ideas and a few scattered phrases. The growing of this body into its
743,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,full stature and perfect shape was the same thing as the gradual
744,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,self-definition of the meaning. And this is the reason why such poems
745,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"strike us as creations, not manufactures, and have the magical effect"
746,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"which mere decoration cannot produce. This is also the reason why, if we"
747,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"insist on asking for the meaning of such a poem, we can only be answered"
748,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,'It means itself.'
749,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
750,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,[Sidenote: THE TWO HERESIES]
751,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
752,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,And so at last I may explain why I have troubled myself and you with
753,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,what may seem an arid controversy about mere words. It is not so. These
754,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,heresies which would make poetry a compound of two factors--a matter
755,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"common to it with the merest prose, _plus_ a poetic form, as the one"
756,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"heresy says: a poetical substance _plus_ a negligible form, as the other"
757,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"says--are not only untrue, they are injurious to the dignity of poetry."
758,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,In an age already inclined to shrink from those higher realms where
759,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"poetry touches religion and philosophy, the formalist heresy encourages"
760,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"men to taste poetry as they would a fine wine, which has indeed an"
761,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"aesthetic value, but a small one. And then the natural man, finding an"
762,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"empty form, hurls into it the matter of cheap pathos, rancid sentiment,"
763,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"vulgar humour, bare lust, ravenous vanity--everything which, in"
764,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"Schiller's phrase[3], the form should extirpate, but which no mere form"
765,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,can extirpate. And the other heresy--which is indeed rather a practise
766,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,than a creed--encourages us in the habit so dear to us of putting our
767,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,own thoughts or fancies into the place of the poet's creation. What he
768,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"meant by _Hamlet_, or the _Ode to a Nightingale_, or _Abt Vogler_, we"
769,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"say, is this or that which we knew already; and so we lose what he had"
770,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"to tell us. But he meant what he said, and said what he meant."
771,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
772,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"Poetry in this matter is not, as good critics of painting and music"
773,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"often affirm, different from the other arts; in all of them the content"
774,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"is one thing with the form. What Beethoven meant by his symphony, or"
775,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"Turner by his picture, was not something which you can name, but the"
776,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"picture and the symphony. Meaning they have, but _what_ meaning can be"
777,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"uttered in no language but their own: and we know this, though some"
778,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"strange delusion makes us think the meaning has less worth, because we"
779,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"cannot put it into words. Well, it is just the same with poetry. But"
780,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"because poetry is words, we vainly fancy that some other words than its"
781,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"own will express its meaning. And they will do so no more--or, if you"
782,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"like to speak loosely, only a little more--than words will express the"
783,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,meaning of the Dresden Madonna. Something a little like it they may
784,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,indeed express. And we may find analogues of the meaning of poetry
785,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"outside it, which may help us to appropriate it. The other arts, the"
786,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"best ideas of philosophy or religion, much that nature and life offer us"
787,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"or force upon us, are akin to it. But they are only akin. Nor is it the"
788,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,expression of them. Poetry does not present to imagination our highest
789,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"knowledge or belief, and much less our dreams and opinions; but it,"
790,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"content and form in unity, embodies in own irreplaceable way something"
791,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"which embodies itself also in other irreplaceable ways, such as"
792,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,philosophy or religion. And just as each of these gives a satisfaction
793,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"which the other cannot possibly give, so we find in poetry, which cannot"
794,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"satisfy the needs they meet, that which by their natures they cannot"
795,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,afford us. But we shall not find it fully if we look for something else.

797,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,[Sidenote: THE FURTHER MEANING OF POETRY]
798,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,
799,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"And yet, when all is said, the question will still recur, though now in"
800,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"quite another sense, What does poetry mean? This unique expression,"
801,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"which cannot be replaced by any other, still seems to be trying to"
802,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"express something beyond itself. And this, we feel, is also what the"

805,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"About the best poetry, and not only the best, there floats an atmosphere"
806,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"of infinite suggestion. The poet speaks to us of one thing, but in this"
807,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"one thing there seems to lurk the secret of all. He said what he meant,"
808,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"but his meaning seems to beckon away beyond itself, or rather to expand"
809,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,into something boundless which is only focussed in it; something also
810,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"which, we feel, would satisfy not only the imagination, but the whole of"

818,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"Those who are susceptible to this effect of poetry find it not only,"
819,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"perhaps not most, in the ideals which she has sometimes described, but"
820,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,in a child's song by Christina Rossetti about a mere crown of
821,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"wind-flowers, and in tragedies like _Lear_, where the sun seems to have"
822,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,set for ever. They hear this spirit murmuring its undertone through the
823,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"_Aeneid_, and catch its voice in the song of Keats's nightingale, and"
824,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"its light upon the figures on the Urn, and it pierces them no less in"
825,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"Shelley's hopeless lament, _O world, O life, O time_, than in the"

827,POETRY FOR POETRY'S SAKE,"cannot be expressed in poetic words or words of any kind, nor yet in"
