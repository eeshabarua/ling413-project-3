91,ROSMER.,"Buckshank bold, and Elfinstone, And more than I can mention here. They caused to be built so stout a ship, And unto Iceland they will steer. "
92,ROSMER.,"They launched the ship upon the sea, Which bellowed like a wrathful bear; Down to the bottom the vessel sank, A laidly Trold has dragged it there. "
93,ROSMER.,"Sank to the bottom the young Roland, And round about he groped awhile. Until he found the path which led Unto the bower of Ellenlile. "
94,ROSMER.,"Young Roland towards the mountain goes, He saw the little sparkles fly: ""Betide whate'er the Lord God will I here will house me verily."" "
95,ROSMER.,"Young Roland into the mountain went, Benumbed with cold his limbs they shook: ""What dost thou here, thou wretched man, On whom the Lord with pity look?"" "
96,ROSMER.,"Then up and spoke Dame Ellenlile: ""Young swain why hither hast thou come? What message hast thou brought to me? Thou'dst better far have staid at home. "
97,ROSMER.,"""Now hie thee to the chamber in, So frozen and so wet withal; But cometh Rosmer Giant home He'll tear thee into pieces small. "
98,ROSMER.,"""Now sit thee down, thou wretched lad, And at the fire thy body cheer; If Rosmer Giant come striding in He'll stick thee on this spit, I fear."" "
99,ROSMER.,"Then home came Rosmer Shank-stretcher, And thus in anger he began: ""Full certainly there's hither come Some Christian woman, child, or man."" "
100,ROSMER.,"Then forward stepped she, Ellenlile, And swore so high and solemnly: ""A crow which bore a dead man's leg E'en now across the house did fly. "
101,ROSMER.,"""A crow which bore a dead man's leg Just now across our house did fly; He cast it in, I cast it out, And that I trow full speedily."" "
102,ROSMER.,"But Rosmer shrieked and sprang about: ""Some Christian wight thon dost conceal, And I will spit and burn thee, Dame, Unless the truth thou dost reveal."" "
103,ROSMER.,"Then Ellenlile her mantle donned, And went and stood by Rosmer's knee: ""O here's a swain from Iceland come, And he's of nearest kin to me."" "
104,ROSMER.,"""If there's a swain from Iceland come, And if he be thy kinsman near, Then I to him will safety pledge, No harm from me he need to fear."" "
105,ROSMER.,"When he two years in the sea had been, Young Roland he would fain be gone; For Ellenlile was now with child, A deed of folly had been done. "
106,ROSMER.,"When that perceived proud Ellenlile, Near Rosmer King she took her stand: ""Now wilt thou give the stranger lad Leave to return to his own land?"" "
107,ROSMER.,"""And if the swain for home doth long, Then I will take him to the shore; And I will give him silver and gold, And in a coffer it will store. "
108,ROSMER.,"And so he took the ruddy gold, And in a coffer it he laid; Unknown to him proud Ellenlile So sly therein herself convey'd. "
109,ROSMER.,"He takes the man beneath his arm, The coffer on his back he throws; Then away, away beneath the salt spray Striding the Giant Rosmer goes. "
110,ROSMER.,"""Now have I brought thee to the land, And moon and sun thou canst behold; And now to use as thou shalt chuse I give this coffer filled with gold."" "
111,ROSMER.,"""I thank thee, Rosmer, honest man, Thou'st brought me out of the ocean wild; And now I'll tell thee a piece of news, The proud Dame Ellen is with child."" "
112,ROSMER.,"Then ran the tears down Rosmer's cheeks, As falls the dew on hill and plain: ""If thou hadst not my troth and oath Here as thou standest thee I'd brain."" "
113,ROSMER.,"Rosmer hied to the hill so fast, As hind before the hart doth run; And when he came within the hill Behold proud Ellenlile was gone. "
114,ROSMER.,"But Ellenlile took Roland's hand, 'Midst sport and jest away they hied; To young Roland she told her tale, And Roland served her as a guide. "
115,ROSMER.,"When Rosmer saw his love was gone, So full was he of grief and dool, He turned him into a huge grey rock, And there he standeth like a fool. "
