66,INTRODUCTION.,INTRODUCTION.
67,INTRODUCTION.,
68,INTRODUCTION.,
69,INTRODUCTION.,In the present edition of Thomas Davis it is designed to offer a
70,INTRODUCTION.,selection of his writings more fully representative than has hitherto
71,INTRODUCTION.,appeared in one volume. The book opens with the best of his historical
72,INTRODUCTION.,studies--his masterly vindication of the much-maligned Irish Parliament
73,INTRODUCTION.,"of James II.[1] Next follows a selection of his literary, historical"
74,INTRODUCTION.,"and political articles from _The Nation_ and other sources, and,"
75,INTRODUCTION.,"finally, we present a selection from his poems, containing, it is"
76,INTRODUCTION.,"hoped, everything of high and permanent value which he wrote in that"
77,INTRODUCTION.,"medium. The ""Address to the Historical Society"" and the essay on"
78,INTRODUCTION.,"""Udalism and Feudalism,"" which were reprinted in the edition of Davis's"
79,INTRODUCTION.,"Prose Writings published by Walter Scott in 1890, are here omitted--the"
80,INTRODUCTION.,former because it seemed possible to fill with more valuable and mature
81,INTRODUCTION.,"work the space it would have taken, and the latter because the cause"
82,INTRODUCTION.,which it was written to support has in our day been practically won;
83,INTRODUCTION.,Udalism will inevitably be the universal type of land-tenure in
84,INTRODUCTION.,"Ireland, and the real problem which we have before us is not how to win"
85,INTRODUCTION.,"but how to make use of the institution, a matter with which Davis, in"
86,INTRODUCTION.,"this essay, does not concern himself."
87,INTRODUCTION.,
88,INTRODUCTION.,"The life of Thomas Davis has been written by his friend and colleague,"
89,INTRODUCTION.,"Sir Charles Gavan Duffy, and an excellent abridgment of it appears as a"
90,INTRODUCTION.,"volume in the ""New Irish Library."" In the latter easily available form"
91,INTRODUCTION.,it may be hoped that there are few Irishmen who have not made
92,INTRODUCTION.,"themselves acquainted with it. It is not, therefore, necessary to deal"
93,INTRODUCTION.,"with it here in much detail. Davis was born in Mallow on October 14th,"
94,INTRODUCTION.,"1814. His father, who came of a family originally Welsh, but long"
95,INTRODUCTION.,"settled in Buckinghamshire, had been a surgeon in the Royal Artillery."
96,INTRODUCTION.,"His mother, Mary Atkins, came of a Cromwellian family settled in the"
97,INTRODUCTION.,County Cork. It does not seem an altogether hopeful kind of ancestry
98,INTRODUCTION.,"for an Irish Nationalist, and his family were, as a matter of fact,"
99,INTRODUCTION.,altogether of the other way of thinking. But the fact that his
100,INTRODUCTION.,"great-grandmother, on the maternal side, was a daughter of The"
101,INTRODUCTION.,"O'Sullivan Beare may have had a counteracting influence, if not through"
102,INTRODUCTION.,"the physical channel of heredity, at least through the poet's"
103,INTRODUCTION.,"imagination. As a child, Davis was delicate in health, sensitive,"
104,INTRODUCTION.,"dreamy, awkward, and passed for a dunce. It was not until he had"
105,INTRODUCTION.,entered Trinity College that the passion for study possessed him. This
106,INTRODUCTION.,"passion had manifestly been kindled, in the first instance, by the"
107,INTRODUCTION.,"flame of patriotism, but how and when he first came to break loose from"
108,INTRODUCTION.,"the traditional politics of his family we have no means of knowing,"
109,INTRODUCTION.,unless a gleam of light is thrown on the matter by a saying of his from
110,INTRODUCTION.,"a speech at Conciliation Hall:--""I was brought up in a mixed seminary,[2]"
111,INTRODUCTION.,"where I learned to know, and knowing to love, my countrymen."""
112,INTRODUCTION.,
113,INTRODUCTION.,"At the University he sought no academic distinctions, but read"
114,INTRODUCTION.,"omnivorously. History, philosophy, economics, and ethics were the"
115,INTRODUCTION.,"subjects into which he flung himself with ardour, and which, in after"
116,INTRODUCTION.,"days, he was continually seeking to turn to the uses of his country. By"
117,INTRODUCTION.,the time he had left College and was called to the Bar (1837) he had
118,INTRODUCTION.,"disciplined himself by thought and study, and was a very different"
119,INTRODUCTION.,being from the dreamy and backward youth described for us by the candid
120,INTRODUCTION.,"friends of his schooldays. A dreamer, indeed, he always was, but he had"
121,INTRODUCTION.,"learned from Bishop Butler, whom he reverenced profoundly and spoke of"
122,INTRODUCTION.,"as ""the Copernicus of ethics,"" that there is no practice more fatal to"
123,INTRODUCTION.,"moral strength than dreaming divorced from action. Some concrete act,"
124,INTRODUCTION.,"some definite thing to be done, was now always in his mind, but always,"
125,INTRODUCTION.,"it may be added, as the realisation of some principle arrived at by"
126,INTRODUCTION.,"serious and accurate thinking. He had acquired clear convictions, his"
127,INTRODUCTION.,"powers of application were enormous, he had a boundless fertility of"
128,INTRODUCTION.,"invention, and was manifestly marked out as a leader of men. It is"
129,INTRODUCTION.,interesting to go through the pages of Davis's Essays and to note how
130,INTRODUCTION.,many of his practical suggestions for work to be done in Ireland have
131,INTRODUCTION.,"been taken up with success, especially in the direction of music and"
132,INTRODUCTION.,"poetry, of the Gaelic language, and of the study of Irish archaeology"
133,INTRODUCTION.,and the protection of its remains. But a new Davis would mark with
134,INTRODUCTION.,keener interest the many tasks which yet remain to be taken in hand.
135,INTRODUCTION.,
136,INTRODUCTION.,His connection with the Bar was little more than nominal; from the
137,INTRODUCTION.,"beginning, the serious work of his life seemed destined to be"
138,INTRODUCTION.,"journalism. After some experiments in various directions, he, with"
139,INTRODUCTION.,"Gavan Duffy and John Blake Dillon, during a walk in the Phoenix Park in"
140,INTRODUCTION.,"the spring of 1842, decided to establish a new weekly journal, to be"
141,INTRODUCTION.,"entitled, on Davis's suggestion, _The Nation_. Its purpose, which it"
142,INTRODUCTION.,"was afterwards to fulfil so nobly, was admirably expressed in its"
143,INTRODUCTION.,"motto, taken from a saying of Stephen Woulfe: ""To create and foster"
144,INTRODUCTION.,"public opinion in Ireland, and to make it racy of the soil."" Davis's"
145,INTRODUCTION.,was the suggestion of making national poems and ballads a prominent
146,INTRODUCTION.,feature of the journal--the feature by which it became best known and
147,INTRODUCTION.,"did, perhaps, its most impressive, if not its most valuable, work. His"
148,INTRODUCTION.,"""Lament for Owen Roe,"" which appeared in the sixth number, worked in"
149,INTRODUCTION.,"Ireland like an electric shock, and woke a sleeping faculty to life and"
150,INTRODUCTION.,action. Henceforth Davis's public life was bound up with the _Nation_.
151,INTRODUCTION.,Into this channel he threw all his powers. What kind of influence he
152,INTRODUCTION.,exerted from that post of vantage the pages of this book will tell.
153,INTRODUCTION.,
154,INTRODUCTION.,"Davis was naturally a member of O'Connell's Repeal Association, but"
155,INTRODUCTION.,"took no prominent part in its proceedings, except on one momentous"
156,INTRODUCTION.,occasion on which we must dwell for a while. The debate was on the
157,INTRODUCTION.,subject of Peel's Bill for the establishment of a large scheme of
158,INTRODUCTION.,non-sectarian education in Ireland. Of this measure Sir Charles Duffy
159,INTRODUCTION.,writes:--
160,INTRODUCTION.,
161,INTRODUCTION.,"""A majority of the Catholic Bishops approved of the general design,"
162,INTRODUCTION.,objecting to certain details. All the barristers and country
163,INTRODUCTION.,"gentlemen in the Association, and the middle class generally,"
164,INTRODUCTION.,supported it. To Davis it was like the unhoped-for realization of a
165,INTRODUCTION.,dream. To educate the young men of the middle class and of both
166,INTRODUCTION.,"races, and to educate them together, that prejudice and bigotry"
167,INTRODUCTION.,"might be killed in the bud, was one of the projects nearest his"
168,INTRODUCTION.,"heart. It would strengthen the soul of Ireland with knowledge, he"
169,INTRODUCTION.,"said, and knit the creeds in liberal and trusting friendship.""[3]"
170,INTRODUCTION.,
171,INTRODUCTION.,"But O'Connell, though he had previously favoured the principle of mixed"
172,INTRODUCTION.,"education, now saw a chance of flinging down a challenge to the ""Young"
173,INTRODUCTION.,"Irelanders"" from a vantage-ground of immense tactical value. He threw"
174,INTRODUCTION.,"his whole weight against the proposal, taunted and interrupted its"
175,INTRODUCTION.,"supporters, and seemed determined at any cost to wreck the measure on"
176,INTRODUCTION.,"which such high hopes had been set. The emotion which Davis felt, and"
177,INTRODUCTION.,"which caused him to burst into tears in the midst of the debate, seemed"
178,INTRODUCTION.,to some of his friends at the time over-strained. But he was not the
179,INTRODUCTION.,first strong man from whom public calamities have drawn tears; and
180,INTRODUCTION.,"assuredly if ever there were cause for tears, Davis had reason to shed"
181,INTRODUCTION.,"them then. More, perhaps, than any man present, he realised the fateful"
182,INTRODUCTION.,nature of the decision which was being made. He knew that one of the
183,INTRODUCTION.,governing facts about Irish public life is the existence in the country
184,INTRODUCTION.,of two races who remain life-long strangers to each other. Catholic and
185,INTRODUCTION.,"Protestant present to each other a familiar front, but behind the"
186,INTRODUCTION.,"surface of each is a dark background which in later life, when"
187,INTRODUCTION.,"associations, and often prejudices, have been formed, the other can"
188,INTRODUCTION.,rarely penetrate and rarely wishes to do so. It was Davis's belief that
189,INTRODUCTION.,if the young people of Ireland were to be permanently segregated from
190,INTRODUCTION.,"childhood to manhood in different schools, different universities,"
191,INTRODUCTION.,"where early friendships, the most intimate and familiar of any, could"
192,INTRODUCTION.,"never be made, and ideas never interchanged except through public"
193,INTRODUCTION.,"controversy, the barrier between the two Irish races would be"
194,INTRODUCTION.,"infinitely difficult to break down, and no scheme of Irish government"
195,INTRODUCTION.,could be conceived which would not seem like a triumph to one of them
196,INTRODUCTION.,and bondage to the other. The views of the Young Irelanders did not
197,INTRODUCTION.,"prevail, and Ireland as a nation has paid the penalty for two"
198,INTRODUCTION.,"generations, and will probably pay it for many a day to come. It may,"
199,INTRODUCTION.,"of course, be argued that religious interests are paramount, and that"
200,INTRODUCTION.,these are incompatible with a scheme of mixed education. This is not
201,INTRODUCTION.,"the place to debate such a question, nor can anyone quarrel with a"
202,INTRODUCTION.,decision arrived at on such grounds. But let it be arrived at with a
203,INTRODUCTION.,"clear understanding of the certain consequences, and let it be admitted"
204,INTRODUCTION.,that when Davis saw the wreck of the scheme for united education he
205,INTRODUCTION.,"felt truly that a long and perhaps, for many generations, irretrievable"
206,INTRODUCTION.,step was being taken away from the road to nationhood.
207,INTRODUCTION.,
208,INTRODUCTION.,"But after this despondent reflection, let us cheer ourselves by setting"
209,INTRODUCTION.,the proud and moving words with which Duffy concludes his account of
210,INTRODUCTION.,the transactions in the _Life of Davis_:--
211,INTRODUCTION.,
212,INTRODUCTION.,"""I have not tacked to any transaction in this narrative the moral"
213,INTRODUCTION.,which it suggests; the thoughtful reader prefers to draw his own
214,INTRODUCTION.,conclusions. But for once I ask those to whom this book is
215,INTRODUCTION.,dedicated to note the conduct of Catholic young men in a mortal
216,INTRODUCTION.,"contest. The hereditary leader of the people, sure to be backed by"
217,INTRODUCTION.,"the whole force of the unreflecting masses, and supported on this"
218,INTRODUCTION.,"occasion by the bulk of the national clergy--a man of genius, an"
219,INTRODUCTION.,historic man wielding an authority made august by a life's
220,INTRODUCTION.,"services, a solemn moral authority with which it is ridiculous to"
221,INTRODUCTION.,compare the purely political influence of anyone who has succeeded
222,INTRODUCTION.,"him as a tribune of the people--was against Thomas Davis, and able,"
223,INTRODUCTION.,"no one doubted, to overwhelm him and his sympathisers in political"
224,INTRODUCTION.,ruin. A public career might be closed for all of us; our journal
225,INTRODUCTION.,might be extinguished; we were already denounced as intriguers and
226,INTRODUCTION.,"infidels; it was quite certain that, by-and-by, we would be"
227,INTRODUCTION.,described as hirelings of the Castle. But Davis was right; and of
228,INTRODUCTION.,"all his associates, not one man flinched from his side--not one"
229,INTRODUCTION.,man. A crisis bringing character to a sharper test has never arisen
230,INTRODUCTION.,"in our history, nor can ever arise; and the conduct of these men,"
231,INTRODUCTION.,"it seems to me, is some guarantee how their successors would act in"
232,INTRODUCTION.,"any similar emergency."""
233,INTRODUCTION.,
234,INTRODUCTION.,The year 1845 was loaded with disaster for Ireland. It saw the defeat
235,INTRODUCTION.,of the Education scheme; it saw the advancing shadow of the awful
236,INTRODUCTION.,"calamity in which the Repeal movement, the Young Irelanders, and"
237,INTRODUCTION.,everything of hope and promise that lived and moved in Ireland were to
238,INTRODUCTION.,perish--and it saw the death of Thomas Davis.
239,INTRODUCTION.,
240,INTRODUCTION.,"He had had an attack of scarlet fever, from which he seemed to be"
241,INTRODUCTION.,"recovering, but a relapse took place--owing, perhaps, to incautious"
242,INTRODUCTION.,"exposure before his strength had returned--and, in the early dawn of"
243,INTRODUCTION.,"September 15th, he passed away in his mother's house. The years of his"
244,INTRODUCTION.,life were thirty-one; his public life had lasted but for three. His
245,INTRODUCTION.,"funeral was marked by an extraordinary outburst of grief and affection,"
246,INTRODUCTION.,"which was shared by men of all creeds, all classes, all political camps"
247,INTRODUCTION.,in Ireland.
248,INTRODUCTION.,
249,INTRODUCTION.,"No mourning, indeed, could be too deep for the withdrawal at such a"
250,INTRODUCTION.,moment of such a leader from the task to which he had consecrated his
251,INTRODUCTION.,life. That task was far more than the winning of political independence
252,INTRODUCTION.,"for his country. Davis united in himself, in a degree which has never"
253,INTRODUCTION.,"been known before or since, the spirit of two great originators in"
254,INTRODUCTION.,Irish history--the spirit of Swift and the spirit of Berkeley--of
255,INTRODUCTION.,"Swift, the champion of his country against foreign oppression; of"
256,INTRODUCTION.,"Berkeley, who bade her turn her thoughts inward, who summoned her to"
257,INTRODUCTION.,cultivate the faculties and use the liberties she already possessed for
258,INTRODUCTION.,the development of her resources and the strengthening of her national
259,INTRODUCTION.,character. Davis's best and most original work was educative rather
260,INTRODUCTION.,"than aggressive. He often wrote, as Duffy says, ""in a tone of strict"
261,INTRODUCTION.,and haughty discipline designed to make the people fit to use and fit
262,INTRODUCTION.,"to enjoy liberty."" No one recognised more fully than he the"
263,INTRODUCTION.,"regenerative value of political forms, but his ideal was never that of"
264,INTRODUCTION.,a millennium to be won by Act of Parliament--he was ever on the watch
265,INTRODUCTION.,for some opportunity to remind his countrymen of the indispensable need
266,INTRODUCTION.,"of self-discipline and self-reliance, of toil, of veracity, of justice"
267,INTRODUCTION.,and fairness towards opponents. No one ever said sharper and sterner
268,INTRODUCTION.,"things to the Irish people--witness his articles on ""Scolding Mobs,"" on"
269,INTRODUCTION.,"""Moral Force,"" and on the attack upon one of the jurors who had"
270,INTRODUCTION.,convicted O'Connell at the State Trial.[4] But Davis could utter hard
271,INTRODUCTION.,"things without wounding, for, when all is said, the dominant temper of"
272,INTRODUCTION.,"the man was love. That, and that alone, was at the very centre of his"
273,INTRODUCTION.,"being, and by that influence everything that came from him was"
274,INTRODUCTION.,"irradiated and warmed. He had, as an Irish patriot, unwavering faith,"
275,INTRODUCTION.,"unquenchable hope; he had also, and above all, the charity which gave"
276,INTRODUCTION.,"to every other faculty and attainment the supreme, the most enduring"
277,INTRODUCTION.,grace.

304,PREFACE.,
305,PREFACE.,
306,PREFACE.,This enquiry is designed to rescue eminent men and worthy acts from
307,PREFACE.,calumnies which were founded on the ignorance and falsehoods of the Old
308,PREFACE.,"Whigs, who never felt secure until they had destroyed the character as"
309,PREFACE.,well as the liberty of Ireland.
310,PREFACE.,
311,PREFACE.,Irish oppression never could rely on mere physical force for any length
312,PREFACE.,"of time. Our enormous military resources, and the large proportion of"
313,PREFACE.,"""fighting men,"" or men who love fighting, among our people, prohibit"
314,PREFACE.,it. It was ever necessary to divide us by circulating extravagant
315,PREFACE.,"stories of our crimes and our disasters, in order to poison the wells"
316,PREFACE.,"of brotherly love and patriotism in our hearts, that so many of us"
317,PREFACE.,might range ourselves under the banner of our oppressor.
318,PREFACE.,
319,PREFACE.,Calumny lives chiefly on the past and future; it corrupts history and
320,PREFACE.,"croaks dark prophecies. Never, from TYRCONNELL'S rally down to"
321,PREFACE.,"O'CONNELL'S revival of the Emancipation struggle--never, from the"
322,PREFACE.,summons of the Dungannon Convention to the Corporation Debate on
323,PREFACE.,"Repeal, has a single bold course been proposed for Ireland, that folly,"
324,PREFACE.,"disorder, and disgrace has not been foreboded. Never has any great deed"
325,PREFACE.,"been done here that the alien Government did not, as soon as the facts"
326,PREFACE.,"became historical, endeavour to blacken the honour of the statesmen,"
327,PREFACE.,"the wisdom of the legislators, or the valour of the soldiers who"
328,PREFACE.,achieved it.
329,PREFACE.,
330,PREFACE.,One of the favourite texts of these apostles of misrule was the Irish
331,PREFACE.,"Government in King JAMES'S time. ""There's a specimen,"" they said, ""of"
332,PREFACE.,"what an Irish Government would be--unruly, rash, rapacious, and"
333,PREFACE.,"bloody."" But the King, Lords, and Commons of 1689, when looked at"
334,PREFACE.,"honestly, present a sight to make us proud and hopeful for Ireland."
335,PREFACE.,"Attached as they were to their King, their first act was for Ireland."
336,PREFACE.,"They declared that the English Parliament had not, and never had, any"
337,PREFACE.,"right to legislate for Ireland, and that none, save the King and"
338,PREFACE.,"Parliament of Ireland, could make laws to bind Ireland."
339,PREFACE.,
340,PREFACE.,"In 1698, just nine years after, while the acts of this great Senate"
341,PREFACE.,"were fresh, Molyneux published his _case of Ireland_, that case which"
342,PREFACE.,"Swift argued, and Lucas urged, and Flood and Grattan, at the head of"
343,PREFACE.,"70,000 Volunteers, carried, and England ratified against her will."
344,PREFACE.,"Thus, then, the idea of 1782 is to be found full grown in 1689. The"
345,PREFACE.,"pedigree of our freedom is a century older than we thought, and Ireland"
346,PREFACE.,has another Parliament to be proud of.
347,PREFACE.,
348,PREFACE.,"That Parliament, too, established religious equality. It anticipated"
349,PREFACE.,"more than 1782. The voluntary system had no supporters then, and that"
350,PREFACE.,patriot Senate did the next best thing: they left the tithes of the
351,PREFACE.,"Protestant People to the Protestant Minister, and of the Catholic"
352,PREFACE.,People to the Catholic Priest. Pensions not exceeding £200 a year were
353,PREFACE.,given to the Catholic Bishops. And no Protestant Prelates were deprived
354,PREFACE.,"of stipend or honour--they held their incomes, and they sat in the"
355,PREFACE.,Parliament. They enforced perfect liberty of conscience; nor is there
356,PREFACE.,an Act of theirs which could inform one ignorant of Irish faction to
357,PREFACE.,what creed the majority belonged. Thus for its moderation and charity
358,PREFACE.,this Parliament is an honour and an example to the country.
359,PREFACE.,
360,PREFACE.,While on the one hand they restored the estates plundered by the
361,PREFACE.,"Cromwellians thirty-six years before, and gave compensation to all"
362,PREFACE.,innocent persons--while they strained every nerve to exclude the
363,PREFACE.,"English from our trade, and to secure it to the Irish--while they"
364,PREFACE.,"introduced the Statute of Frauds, and many other sound laws, and thus"
365,PREFACE.,"showed their zeal for the peaceful and permanent welfare of the People,"
366,PREFACE.,they were not unfit to grapple with the great military crisis. They
367,PREFACE.,voted large supplies; they endeavoured to make a war-navy; the leading
368,PREFACE.,members allowed nothing but their Parliamentary duties to interfere

370,PREFACE.,"timorous pedants, who shook and made homilies when sabres flashed and"
371,PREFACE.,"cannon roared. Our greatest soldiers, M'Carthy and Tyrconnell, and,"
372,PREFACE.,"indeed, most of the Colonels of the Irish regiments, sat in Lords or"
373,PREFACE.,"Commons;--not that the Crown brought in stipendiary soldiers, but that"
374,PREFACE.,"the Senate were fearless patriots, who were ready to fight as well as"
375,PREFACE.,to plan for Ireland. Theirs was no qualified preference for freedom if
376,PREFACE.,it were lightly won--they did not prefer 'Bondage with ease to
377,PREFACE.,strenuous liberty.'

383,PREFACE.,time--that time of glory and misfortune--that time of which Limerick's

397,A RETROSPECT.,
398,A RETROSPECT.,
399,A RETROSPECT.,How far the Parliament which sat in Dublin in 1689 was right or wrong
400,A RETROSPECT.,has been much disputed. As the history of it becomes more accurately
401,A RETROSPECT.,"and generally known, the grounds of this dispute will be cleared."
402,A RETROSPECT.,
403,A RETROSPECT.,"Nor is it of trifling interest to determine whether a Parliament, which"
404,A RETROSPECT.,"not only exercised great influence at the time, but furnished the"
405,A RETROSPECT.,"enactors of the Penal Laws with excuses, and the achievers of the"
406,A RETROSPECT.,"Revolution of 1782 with principles and a precedent, was the good or"
407,A RETROSPECT.,evil thing it has been called.
408,A RETROSPECT.,
409,A RETROSPECT.,"The writers commonly quoted against it are, Archbishop King, Harris,"
410,A RETROSPECT.,"Leland; those in its favour, Leslie, Curry, Plowden, and Jones.[5] Of"
411,A RETROSPECT.,"all these writers, King and Lesley are alone original authorities."
412,A RETROSPECT.,"Harris copies King, and Leland copies Harris, and Plowden, Curry, and"
413,A RETROSPECT.,"Jones rely chiefly on Lesley. Neither Harris, Leland, nor Curry adds"
414,A RETROSPECT.,"anything to our knowledge of the time. King (notwithstanding, as we"
415,A RETROSPECT.,"shall show hereafter, his disregard of truth) is valuable as a"
416,A RETROSPECT.,"contemporary of high rank; Lesley, also a contemporary, and of"
417,A RETROSPECT.,"unblemished character, is still more valuable. Plowden is a fair and"
418,A RETROSPECT.,"sagacious commentator; Jones, a subtle and suggestive critic on those"
419,A RETROSPECT.,times.
420,A RETROSPECT.,
421,A RETROSPECT.,"If, in addition, the reader will consult such authorities as the"
422,A RETROSPECT.,Letters of Lord Lieutenant Tyrconnell;[6] the Memoirs[7] of James the
423,A RETROSPECT.,Second by himself; _Histoire de la Révolution par Mazure_;[8] and
424,A RETROSPECT.,"the pamphlets quoted in this publication, and the notes to it, he will"
425,A RETROSPECT.,be in a fair way towards mastering this difficult question.
426,A RETROSPECT.,
427,A RETROSPECT.,"After all, that Parliament must be judged by its own conduct. If its"
428,A RETROSPECT.,"acts were unjust, bigoted, and rash, no excuse can save it from"
429,A RETROSPECT.,"condemnation. If, on the other hand, it acted with firmness and loyalty"
430,A RETROSPECT.,"towards its king--if it did much to secure the rights, the prosperity,"
431,A RETROSPECT.,"and the honour of the nation--if, in a country where property had been"
432,A RETROSPECT.,"turned upside down a few years before, it strove to do justice to the"
433,A RETROSPECT.,"many, with the least possible injury to the few--if, in a country torn"
434,A RETROSPECT.,"with religious quarrels, it endeavoured to secure liberty of conscience"
435,A RETROSPECT.,"without alienating the ultra zealous--and, finally, if in a country in"
436,A RETROSPECT.,"imminent danger from a powerful invader and numerous traitors, it was"
437,A RETROSPECT.,more intent on raising resources and checking treason than would become
438,A RETROSPECT.,"a parliament sitting in peace and safety, let us, while confessing its"
439,A RETROSPECT.,"fallibility, attend to its difficulties, and do honour to its vigour"
440,A RETROSPECT.,and intelligence.
441,A RETROSPECT.,
442,A RETROSPECT.,"Before we mention the composition of the Parliament, it will be right"
443,A RETROSPECT.,to run over some of the chief dates and facts which brought about the
444,A RETROSPECT.,state of things that led to its being summoned. Most Irishmen
445,A RETROSPECT.,"(ourselves among the number) are only beginners at Irish history, and"
446,A RETROSPECT.,cannot too often repeat the elements: still the beginning has been
447,A RETROSPECT.,made. It is no pedantry which leads one to the English invasion for the
448,A RETROSPECT.,tap-root of the transactions of the seventeenth century.
449,A RETROSPECT.,
450,A RETROSPECT.,Four hundred years of rapacious war and wild resistance had made each
451,A RETROSPECT.,believe all things ill of the other; and when England changed her creed
452,A RETROSPECT.,in the sixteenth century it became certain that Ireland would adhere to
453,A RETROSPECT.,"hers at all risks. Accordingly, the reigns of the latter, and"
454,A RETROSPECT.,"especially of the last of the Tudors, witnessed unceasing war, in which"
455,A RETROSPECT.,"an appetite for conquest was inflamed by bigotry on the English side,"
456,A RETROSPECT.,"while the native, who had been left unaided to defend his home, was now"
457,A RETROSPECT.,"stimulated by foreign counsels, as well as by his own feelings, to"
458,A RETROSPECT.,guard his altar and his conscience too.
459,A RETROSPECT.,
460,A RETROSPECT.,James the First found Ireland half conquered by the sword; he completed
461,A RETROSPECT.,"the work by treachery, and the fee of five-sixths of Ulster rewarded"
462,A RETROSPECT.,"the ""energy"" of the British. The proceedings of Strafford added large"
463,A RETROSPECT.,"districts in the other provinces to the English possessions. Still, in"
464,A RETROSPECT.,"all these cases, as in the Munster settlement under Elizabeth, the bulk"
465,A RETROSPECT.,of the population remained on the soil. To leave the land was to die.
466,A RETROSPECT.,They clung to it amid sufferings too shocking to dwell on;[9] they
467,A RETROSPECT.,clung to it under such a serfhood as made the rapacity of their
468,A RETROSPECT.,conquerors interested in retaining them on the soil. They clung to it
469,A RETROSPECT.,from necessity and from love. They multiplied on it with the rapidity
470,A RETROSPECT.,"of the reckless. Yet they retained hope, the hope of restitution and"
471,A RETROSPECT.,vengeance. The mad ferocity of Parsons and Borlace hastened the
472,A RETROSPECT.,outbreak of 1641. That insurrection gave back to the native his
473,A RETROSPECT.,"property and his freedom, but compelled him to fight for it--first,"
474,A RETROSPECT.,"against the loyalists; next, against the traitors; and lastly, against"
475,A RETROSPECT.,"the republicans. After a struggle of ten years, distinguished by the"
476,A RETROSPECT.,"ability of the Council of Kilkenny, and the bravery of Owen Roe and his"
477,A RETROSPECT.,"followers, the Irish sunk under the abilities and hosts of Cromwell."
478,A RETROSPECT.,Those who felt his sway might well have envied the men who conquered
479,A RETROSPECT.,"and died in the breach of Clonmel, or fell vanquished or betrayed at"
480,A RETROSPECT.,"Letterkenny and Drogheda. During the insurrection of 1641, the royal"
481,A RETROSPECT.,"government, at once timid and tyrannical, united with the sordid"
482,A RETROSPECT.,"capitalists of London to plunder the Irish of their lands and liberty,"
483,A RETROSPECT.,"if not to exterminate them.[10] In order to effect this, a system of"
484,A RETROSPECT.,unparalleled lying was set afoot against the natives of this kingdom.
485,A RETROSPECT.,The violence which naturally attended the sudden resumption of property
486,A RETROSPECT.,"by an ignorant, excited, and deeply wronged people, was magnified into"
487,A RETROSPECT.,a national propensity to throat-cutting. Exaggerations the most
488,A RETROSPECT.,"barefaced were received throughout England. Deaths, which the"
489,A RETROSPECT.,"English-minded Protestant, the Rev. Mr. Warner, has ascertained to have"
490,A RETROSPECT.,"been under 12,000--reckoning deaths from hardships along with those by"
491,A RETROSPECT.,"the sword--were rated in England at 150,000, and by John Milton at"
492,A RETROSPECT.,"616,000.[11] No wonder the English nation looked upon us as bloody"
493,A RETROSPECT.,savages; and no wonder they looked approvingly at the massacres and
494,A RETROSPECT.,confiscations of the Lord Protector. But the Irish deemed they were
495,A RETROSPECT.,free from crime in resuming by force of arms the land which arms had
496,A RETROSPECT.,taken from them; they regarded the bloodshed of '41 as a deplorable
497,A RETROSPECT.,result of English oppression; they fought with the hearts of resolved
498,A RETROSPECT.,patriots till 1651.
499,A RETROSPECT.,
500,A RETROSPECT.,The restoration of the Stuarts was hailed as the restoration of their
501,A RETROSPECT.,rights. They were woefully disappointed. A compromise was made between
502,A RETROSPECT.,the legitimists and the republicans; the former were to resume their
503,A RETROSPECT.,"rank, the latter to retain their plunder, Ireland was disregarded. The"
504,A RETROSPECT.,mockery of the Court of Claims restored less than one-third of the
505,A RETROSPECT.,Irish lands. While in 1641 the Roman Catholics possessed two-thirds of
506,A RETROSPECT.,"Ireland, in 1680 they had but one-fifth[12]. Besides, the new"
507,A RETROSPECT.,"possessors were of an opposite creed, and fortified themselves by Penal"
508,A RETROSPECT.,Laws. Under such circumstances the aim of most men would be much the
509,A RETROSPECT.,"same, namely, to take the first opportunity of regaining their"
510,A RETROSPECT.,"property, their national independence, and religious freedom. With"
511,A RETROSPECT.,"reference to their legislation on the two latter points, doubts may be"
512,A RETROSPECT.,entertained how much should be complained of; and even those who
513,A RETROSPECT.,"condemn that on the first, should remember that ""the re-adjustment of"
514,A RETROSPECT.,"all private rights, after so entire a destruction of their landmarks,"
515,A RETROSPECT.,"could only be effected by the coarse process of general rules[13]."""
516,A RETROSPECT.,
517,A RETROSPECT.,"Let us now run over a few dates, till we come to the event which gave"
518,A RETROSPECT.,"the Irish this opportunity. On the 6th of February, 1685, Charles the"
519,A RETROSPECT.,"Second died in the secret profession of the Roman Catholic faith, and"
520,A RETROSPECT.,"his brother, James Stuart, Duke of York, succeeded him."
521,A RETROSPECT.,
522,A RETROSPECT.,James the Second came to his throne with much of what usually wins
523,A RETROSPECT.,"popular favour. He united in his person the blood of the Tudor,"
524,A RETROSPECT.,"Plantagenet, and Saxon kings of England, while his Scottish descent"
525,A RETROSPECT.,"came through every king of Scotland, and found its spring in the Irish"
526,A RETROSPECT.,"Dalriad chief, who, embarking from Ulster, overran Albany. In addition,"
527,A RETROSPECT.,"James had morals better than those of his rank and time, as much"
528,A RETROSPECT.,"intellect as most kings, and the reputation acquired from his naval"
529,A RETROSPECT.,"administration, graced as it was by sea-fights in which no ship was"
530,A RETROSPECT.,"earlier in action than James's, and by at least one great victory--that"
531,A RETROSPECT.,"over Opdam--fought near Yarmouth, on the 3rd June, 1665."
532,A RETROSPECT.,
533,A RETROSPECT.,Yet the difference of his creed from that of his English subjects blew
534,A RETROSPECT.,"these popular recollections to shivers. He tried to enforce, first,"
535,A RETROSPECT.,"toleration; and, secondly, perfect religious equality, and intended,"
536,A RETROSPECT.,"as many thought, the destruction of that equality, by substituting a"
537,A RETROSPECT.,Roman Catholic for a Protestant supremacy; and the means he used for
538,A RETROSPECT.,this purpose were such as the English Parliament had pronounced
539,A RETROSPECT.,unconstitutional. He impeached the corporate charters by _quo
540,A RETROSPECT.,"warranto_, brought to trial before judges whom he influenced, as all"
541,A RETROSPECT.,"his predecessors had done. He invaded the customs of the universities,"
542,A RETROSPECT.,"as having a legal right to do so. He suspended the penal laws, and"
543,A RETROSPECT.,punished those who disobeyed his liberal but unpopular proclamations.
544,A RETROSPECT.,"Some noble zealots, the Russells and Sidneys, crossed his path in vain;"
545,A RETROSPECT.,"but a few bold caballers, the Danbys, the Shaftesburys, and Churchills,"
546,A RETROSPECT.,"by urging him to despotic acts, and the people to resistance, brought"
547,A RETROSPECT.,"on a crisis; when, availing themselves of it, they called in a foreign"
548,A RETROSPECT.,"army and drove out James, and swore he had abdicated; expelled the"
549,A RETROSPECT.,"Prince of Wales, and falsely called him bastard; made terms with"
550,A RETROSPECT.,"William, that he should have the crown and privy purse, and they the"
551,A RETROSPECT.,actual government; and ended by calling their selfish and hypocritical
552,A RETROSPECT.,"work, ""a popular and glorious revolution."""
553,A RETROSPECT.,
554,A RETROSPECT.,It is needless to follow up James's quarrel with the university of
555,A RETROSPECT.,"Oxford, and his unsuccessful prosecution of the seven Bishops on the"
556,A RETROSPECT.,"29th of June, 1688, who, emboldened by the prospect of a revolution,"
557,A RETROSPECT.,refused to read his proclamation of indulgence. From the day of their
558,A RETROSPECT.,"acquittal, James was lost. Letters were circulated throughout"
559,A RETROSPECT.,"England[14] and Ireland, declaring the young Prince of Wales (who was"
560,A RETROSPECT.,"born 10th June) spurious, and containing many other falsehoods, so as"
561,A RETROSPECT.,"to shake men's souls with rumours, and arouse popular prejudices. The"
562,A RETROSPECT.,army was tampered with; the nobles and clergy were in treaty with
563,A RETROSPECT.,Holland. James not only refused to retract his policy till it was too
564,A RETROSPECT.,"late; but refused, too, the offer of Louis to send him French troops."
565,A RETROSPECT.,
566,A RETROSPECT.,"Similar means had been used by and against him in Ireland. Tyrconnell,"
567,A RETROSPECT.,"who had replaced Clarendon as Lord Lieutenant in 1686, got in the"
568,A RETROSPECT.,"charters of the corporations, reconstructed the army, and used every"
569,A RETROSPECT.,means of giving the Roman Catholics that share in the government of
570,A RETROSPECT.,"this country to which their numbers entitled them. And, on the other"
571,A RETROSPECT.,"hand, the Protestant nobles joined the English conspiracy, and adopted"
572,A RETROSPECT.,the English plan of false plots and forged letters.
573,A RETROSPECT.,
574,A RETROSPECT.,"At length, on 4th November, 1688, Prince William landed at Torbay with"
575,A RETROSPECT.,"15,000 veterans. James attempted to bear up, but his nearest and"
576,A RETROSPECT.,"dearest, his relatives and his favourites, deserted him in the hour of"
577,A RETROSPECT.,his need. It seems not excessive to say that there never was a
578,A RETROSPECT.,"revolution in which so much ingratitude, selfishness, and meanness were"
579,A RETROSPECT.,displayed. There is not one great genius or untainted character eminent
580,A RETROSPECT.,"in it. Yet it succeeded. On the 18th of December, William entered"
581,A RETROSPECT.,"London; on the 23rd, James sailed for France; and in the February"
582,A RETROSPECT.,following the English convention declared he had _abdicated_.
583,A RETROSPECT.,
584,A RETROSPECT.,"These dates are, as Plowden remarks, important; for though James's"
585,A RETROSPECT.,"flight, on the 23rd of December, was the legal pretence for"
586,A RETROSPECT.,"insurrection in the summer of 1689, yet negotiations had been going on"
587,A RETROSPECT.,"with Holland through 1687 and 1688,[15] and the Northern Irish formed"
588,A RETROSPECT.,"themselves into military corps, and attacked the soldiers of the crown"
589,A RETROSPECT.,"before Enniskillen, on the _first week_ in December; and on the 7th"
590,A RETROSPECT.,December the gates of Derry were shut in the face of the king's
591,A RETROSPECT.,"troops,[16] facts which should be remembered in judging the loyalty of"
592,A RETROSPECT.,the two parties.

684,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,King's impeachment of this parliament is amusing enough. His first
685,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"charge is, that if the House were full, the majority would have been"
686,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"Protestant. Now, if the majority preferred acting as insurgents under"
687,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"the Prince of Orange, to attending to their duties in the Irish house"

690,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"bishop of Meath not only attended, but carried on a bold and systematic"
691,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"opposition. And so far was the House from resenting this, that they"
692,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,committed the sheriff of Dublin to prison for billeting an officer at
693,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,the bishop of Meath's. Yet the bishop had not merely resisted their
694,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"favourite repeal of the Settlement, but, in doing so, had stigmatized"
695,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,their fathers and some of themselves as murderous rebels.
696,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,
697,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"King's next charge is, that the attainders of many peers were reversed"
698,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"to admit them. Now this is unsupported evidence against fact, and"

707,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"Fitton, Lord Gosworth, occupied the woolsack. That he was a man of"
708,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"capacity, if not of character, may be fairly presumed from his party"
709,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,having put him in so important an office in such trying times.[18] He
710,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,certainly had neither faction nor following to bring with him. Nor was

712,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,appointments in his court were not interfered with: his decrees were
713,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"not impeached, and in the council he sat above even Herbert, the Lord"

738,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"against the first, till an express resolution excluded him by name from"
739,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,appearing at the bar of the council. Then Colonel Talbot (Tyrconnell)
740,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,led the opposition effort for their repeal or mild administration. In
741,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"1686, Sir Richard Nagle went to England, as agent of the Irish, to seek"
742,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,their repeal. But the greatest effort was made in 1688. Nugent and Rice
743,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,were sent expressly to London to press the repeal. Rice is said to have
744,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"shown great tact and eloquence, but Nugent to have been rash and"
745,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"confused. Certain it is, they were unsuccessful with the council, and"
746,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"were brutally insulted by the London mob, set on by the very decent"

761,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"24th April, 1697. He was educated in St. Patrick's schools, and won his"
762,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"fellowship in T.C.D. in 1662, being only 19 years old. He led the"
763,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,opposition in the parliament of '89 with great vigour and pertinacity.
764,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"He resisted all the principal measures, and procured great changes in"
765,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"some of them, as appears by ""The Journal."" He had a fearless character"
766,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,and ready tongue. He continued a leader of the Ultras after the battle

768,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"how slowly the Irish war proceeded, had prepared and sent to Ireland a"

771,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,an establishment for their clergy.[19] While this was with the printers
772,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"in Dublin, news came of the danger of Limerick. The proclamation was"

780,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"preached a sermon, whose whole object was to urge the breaking of the"
781,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"treaty of Limerick, contending (says Harris, in his Irish Writers in"
782,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"Ware, p. 215) that ""peace ought not to be kept with a people so"
783,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,"perfidious."" The Justices, and the Williamite or moderate party, were"
784,ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE PARLIAMENT.--THE HOUSE OF LORDS.,enraged at this. The bishop of Kildare was directed to preach in Christ

968,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"The number of members in the Commons, as the complement was made up"
969,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"under the monstrous charters of James I., Charles I., and Charles II.,"
970,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,far outdoing in their unconstitutional nature any of the stretchings of
971,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"prerogative in the reign of James II., amounted to 300. The number"
972,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"actually returned was 224. Of the deficiencies, no less than 28 were"
973,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,caused by the places being the seats of the war.
974,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
975,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"The character of this assembly must be chiefly judged by its acts, and"
976,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,we shall presently resume the consideration of them; but there are some
977,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,things in the composition of the Commons whereby their character has
978,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,been judged.
979,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
980,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"They have been denounced by King: but before we examine his statements,"
981,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"let us inquire who he was, lest we underrate or overrate his testimony;"
982,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"lest we unjustly require proof, in addition to the witness of a"
983,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"thoroughly pure and wise man; or, what is more dangerous, lest we"
984,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,remain content with the unconfirmed statements of a bigot or knave.
985,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
986,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"William King was the son of James King, a miller, who, in order to"
987,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"avoid taking the Solemn League and Covenant, removed from the North of"
988,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Scotland, and settled in Antrim, where William was born, 1st of May,"
989,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"1650. (See Harris's ""Ware,"" Bishops of Derry.) He was educated at"
990,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Dungannon, was a sizar, ""_native_,"" and schoolmaster in T.C.D., and was"
991,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"ordained in 1673. Parker, archbishop of Tuam, gave him a heap of"
992,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"livings, and on being translated to Dublin, procured the Chancellorship"
993,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,of St. Patrick's for King in 1679. This he held during the Revolution.
994,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"He was imprisoned in 1689 on suspicion, but after some months was"
995,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"released, through the influence of Herbert and Tyrconnell, and"
996,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,notwithstanding C. J. Nugent's opposition. Immediately on his release
997,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"he wrote his ""State of the Protestants of Ireland,"" printed in London,"
998,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"_cum privilegio_, at the chief Williamite printer's. It was written and"
999,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"published while the war in Ireland was at its height, and when it was"
1000,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,sought at any price to check the Jacobite feeling then beginning to
1001,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"revive in England, by running down the conduct of the Irish, James's"
1002,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"most formidable supporters. Moreover, King had been imprisoned (justly"
1003,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"or unjustly) by James's council, and he obtained the bishopric of Derry"
1004,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"from William, on the 25th of January, 1690 (old style), namely, within"
1005,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"thirty-eight weeks before the publication of his book, which was"
1006,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"printed, _cum privilegio_, 15th of October, 1691. Whether the bishopric"
1007,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"was the wages of the book, or the book revenge for the imprisonment, we"
1008,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,shall not say; but surely King must have had marvellous virtue to write
1009,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"impartially, in excited and reckless times, for so demoralized a party"
1010,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"as the English Whigs, when he wrote of transactions yet incomplete, of"
1011,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"which there was a perilous stake not only for him but for his friends,"
1012,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"and when, of the parties at issue, one gave him a gaol and the other a"
1013,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,mitre.
1014,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1015,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,There is scarcely a section in his book that does not abound with the
1016,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"most superlative charges, put in the coarsest language. All the"
1017,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"calumnies as to 1641, which are now confessed to be false, are gospel"
1018,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,truths in his book. He never gives an exact authority for any of his
1019,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"graver charges, and his appendix is a valuable reply to his text."
1020,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1021,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"When, in addition to these external probabilites and intrinsic"
1022,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"evidences of falsehood, we add that, immediately on its publication,"
1023,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Lesley wrote an answer to it, denying its main statements as mere lies,"
1024,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"and that his book was never replied to, we will not be in a hurry to"
1025,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,adopt any statement of King's.
1026,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1027,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,But in order to see the force of this last objection to King's
1028,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"credibility, something must be known of Lesley."
1029,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1030,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Charles Lesley, son of the bishop of Clogher, is chiefly known for his"
1031,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"very able controversial writings against Deists, Catholics, and"
1032,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Dissenters. He was a law-student till 1680, when he took orders; and in"
1033,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"1687 became chancellor of Connor. When, in 1688, James appointed a"
1034,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Roman Catholic sheriff for Monaghan, Mr. Lesley, being then sick with"
1035,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"gout, had himself carried to the courthouse, and induced the"
1036,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"magistrates to commit the sheriff. In fact, it appears from Harris"
1037,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"(""Life of William,"" p. 216, and ""Writers of Ireland,"" pp. 282-6), that"
1038,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Lesley was notorious for his conversions of Roman Catholics, and his"
1039,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,stern hostility to Tyrconnell's government. Lesley refused to take the
1040,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"oath of supremacy after the Revolution, and thereby lost all chance of"
1041,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"promotion in the Church. He was looked on as the head of the nonjurors,"
1042,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"and died in March, 1721-2, at Glaslough, universally respected."
1043,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1044,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Such being Mr. Lesley's character, so able, so upright, so zealously"
1045,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Protestant, he, in 1692, wrote an answer to King's ""State,"" in which he"
1046,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,accuses King of the basest personal hypocrisy and charges him with
1047,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"having in his book written gross, abominable, and notorious falsehoods,"
1048,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"and this he _proves_ in several instances, and in many more renders it"
1049,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"highly probable. King died 8th May, 1729, leaving Lesley's book"
1050,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,altogether unreplied to.
1051,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1052,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,Here then was that man--bishop of Derry for eleven years and archbishop
1053,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,of Dublin for twenty-seven years--remaining silent under a charge of
1054,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"deliberate and interested falsehood, and that charge made by no"
1055,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"unworthy man, but by one of his own country, neighbourhood, and"
1056,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"creed--by one of acknowledged virtue, high position, and vast"
1057,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,abilities.
1058,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1059,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,Nor is this all; Lesley's book was not only unanswered; it was watched
1060,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"and attempted to be stopped, and when published, was instantly ordered"
1061,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"to be suppressed, as were all other publications in favour of the Irish"
1062,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,or of King James.
1063,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1064,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,The reader is now in a position to judge of the credibility of any
1065,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"assertion of King's, when unsupported by other authority."
1066,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1067,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,King's gravest charges are in the following passage:--
1068,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1069,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"""These members of the House of Commons are elected either by"
1070,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"freeholders of counties, or the freemen of the corporations; and I"
1071,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,have already showed how king James wrested these out of the hands
1072,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"of Protestants, and put them into Popish hands in the new"
1073,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"constitution of corporations, by which the freemen and freeholders"
1074,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"of cities or boroughs, to whom the election of burgesses originally"
1075,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"belongs, are excluded, and the election put into the hands of a"
1076,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"small number of men named by the king, and removable at his"
1077,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"pleasure. The Protestant freeholders, if they had been in the"
1078,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"kingdom, were much more than the papist freeholders, but now being"
1079,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"gone, though many counties could not make a jury, as appeared at"
1080,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"the intended trial of Mr. Price and other Protestants at Wicklow,"
1081,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"who could not be tried for want of freeholders--yet, notwithstanding"
1082,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"the paucity of these, they made a shift to return knights of the"
1083,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,shire. The common way of election was thus:--The Earl of
1084,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Tyrconnell, together with the writ for election, commonly sent a"
1085,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"letter, recommending the persons he designed should be chosen; the"
1086,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"sheriff or mayor being his creature, on receipt of this, called so"
1087,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,many of the freeholders of a county or burgesses of a corporation
1088,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"together, as he thought fit, and without making any noise, made the"
1089,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"return. It was easier to do this in boroughs--because, by their new"
1090,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"charters, the electors were not above twelve or thirteen, and in"
1091,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"the greatest cities but twenty-four; and commonly, not half of"
1092,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,these in the place. The method of the Sheriff's proceeding was the
1093,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"same; the number of Popish freeholders being very small, sometimes"
1094,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"not a dozen in a county, it was easier to give notice to them to"
1095,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"appear, so that the Protestants either did not know of the election"
1096,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"or durst not appear at it."""
1097,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1098,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"First let us see about the boroughs. King, in his section on the"
1099,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"corporations, states in terms that ""they"" (the Protestants) ""thought it"
1100,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"reasonable to keep these (corporate towns) in their own hands, as being"
1101,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"the foundation of the legislative power, and therefore secluded"
1102,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"papists,"" etc. The purport, therefore, of King's objection to the new"
1103,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,constitution under King James's charters was the admission of Roman
1104,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,Catholics. Religious equality was sinful in his eyes.
1105,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1106,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"The means used by James to change the corporations, namely bringing"
1107,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"_quo warrantos_ in the Exchequer against them, and employing all the"
1108,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"niceties of a confused law to quash them, we have before condemned. In"
1109,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"doing so, he had the precedents of the reigns called most constitutional"
1110,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"by English historians, and those not old, but during his brother's"
1111,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,reign; nor can anyone who has looked into Brady's treatise on Boroughs
1112,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"doubt that there was plenty of ""law"" in favour of James's conduct.[26]"
1113,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,But still public policy and public opinion in England were against
1114,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"these _quo warrantos_, and in Ireland they were only approved of by"
1115,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,those who were to be benefited by them.
1116,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1117,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"But the means being thus improper, the use made by James of this power"
1118,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,can hardly be complained of. The Roman Catholics were then about
1119,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"900,000, the Protestants, over 300,000. James, it is confessed, allowed"
1120,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"one-third of the corporations to be Protestant, though they were"
1121,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"little, if at all, more than one-fourth of the population. This will"
1122,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"appear no great injustice in our times, although some of these"
1123,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Protestants may, as it has been alleged, have been ""Quakers."""
1124,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1125,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,It must also be remembered that those proceedings were begun not by
1126,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"James but by Charles; that the corporations were, with some show of"
1127,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"law, conceived to have been forfeited during the Irish war, or the"
1128,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Cromwellian rule; and that being offered renewals on terms, they"
1129,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,refused; whereupon the _quo warrantos_ were brought and decided before
1130,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,the regular tribunals during the earlier and middle part of James's
1131,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"reign. On the 24th September, 1687, James issued his Royal Letter (to"
1132,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"be found in Harris's Appendix, pp. 4 to 6), commanding the renewal of"
1133,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"the charters. By these renewals, the first members of the corporations"
1134,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"were to be named by the lord lieutenant, but they were afterwards to"
1135,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,be elected by the corporations themselves. There certainly are
1136,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"_non-obstante_ and non-resistance clauses ordered to be inserted, in"
1137,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"the prerogative spirit of that day, which were justly complained of."
1138,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1139,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"With reference to the number of burgesses, King's statement that the"
1140,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"number of electors was usually twelve or thirteen, and in the greatest"
1141,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"cities but twenty-four, is untrue. Most of the Irish boroughs were"
1142,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,certainly reduced to these numbers under the liberal Hanoverian
1143,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"government, but not so under James. The members' names are given in"
1144,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"full in Harris's Appendix, and from those it appears that no"
1145,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"corporation had so few as twelve electors. Only five, viz.--Dungannon,"
1146,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Ennis, St. Johnstown (in Longford), Belturbet, and Athboy, were as low"
1147,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"as thirteen; twenty-three, viz.--Tuam, Kildare, Cavan, Galway, Callan,"
1148,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Newborough, Carlingford, Gowran, Carysfort, Boyle, Roscommon, Athy,"
1149,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Strabane, Middletown, Newry, Philipstown, Banagher, Castlebar, Fethard,"
1150,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Blessington, Charleville, Thomastown, and Baltimore, varied from"
1151,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,fourteen to twenty-four; most of the rest varied from thirty to forty.
1152,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Dublin had seventy-three; Cork, sixty-one; Clonmel, forty-six; Cashel,"
1153,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"forty-two; Drogheda, fifty-seven; Kilkenny, sixty-one; Limerick,"
1154,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"sixty-five; Waterford, forty-nine; Youghal, forty-six; Wexford,"
1155,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"fifty-three, and Derry, sixty-four. This is a striking proof of the"
1156,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,little reliance to be placed on King's positive statements.
1157,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1158,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Harris, a hostile authority, gives the names and generally the"
1159,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"additions of the members of each corporation, and the majority are"
1160,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"merchants, respectable traders, engineers, or gentlemen. Moreover, in"
1161,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"such towns as our local knowledge extends to, the names are those of"
1162,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"the best families, not being zealous Williamites. As to the counties,"
1163,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"King relies upon a pamphlet published in London in 1689, setting out"
1164,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"great grievances in the title page, and disproving them in the body of"
1165,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,the tract.
1166,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1167,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"If many Protestant freeholders had fled to England, who was to"
1168,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"blame?--Most assuredly, my Lord Mount Alexander and the rest of the"
1169,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"right noble and honourable suborners, devisers, and propagators of"
1170,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"forged letters and infamous reports, whereby they frightened the"
1171,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Protestants, in order to take advantage of their terror for their own"
1172,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,selfish ends. The exposure of these devices by the publication of
1173,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"""Speke's Memoirs,"" by the confessed forgery of the Dromore letter,"
1174,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"etc., have thrown the chief blame of the Protestant desertion off the"
1175,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"shoulders of those Protestants, off the shoulders, too, of the Irish"
1176,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"government, and have brought it crushingly upon the aristocratic cabal,"
1177,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"who alone profited by the revolution, as they alone caused it."
1178,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1179,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"In the absence of other testimony, we must take, with similar allowances,"
1180,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"the story of Tyrconnell ""_commonly_"" sending an unconstitutional letter"
1181,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,to influence the election. But how very good these Jacobite sheriffs
1182,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"and mayors were to let King into the secret, in 1691, when their"
1183,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"destiny was uncertain! That such gossip was current is likely, but for"
1184,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,a historian to assert on such authority is scandalous.
1185,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1186,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"King asserts that the unrepresented boroughs were ""_about twenty-nine_."""
1187,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Now, there were but _eighteen_ boroughs unrestored; but King helps out"
1188,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"the falsehood by inserting places--Thurles, Tipperary, Arklow, and"
1189,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Birr--which _never_ had members before or since, by _creating_ a"
1190,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"_second_ town of Kells, by transferring St. Johnstown in Longford which"
1191,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"returned members, to St. Johnstown in Donegal, which was a seat of war,"
1192,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,and by other tricks equally discreditable to his honesty and
1193,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,intelligence.
1194,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1195,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,The towns unrestored _could_ not have sent members to James's
1196,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"parliament, and it was apparently doubted whether they ought to have"
1197,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,done so to William's in '92.
1198,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1199,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,Against the Commons actually elected the charge is that only six
1200,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,Protestants were elected. In the very section containing the charge it
1201,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"is much qualified by other statements. ""Thus,"" he says, ""one Gerard"
1202,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Dillon, Sergeant-at-Law, a most furious Papist, was Recorder of Dublin,"
1203,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"and he stood to be chosen one of the burgesses for the city, but could"
1204,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"not prevail, because he had purchased a considerable estate under the"
1205,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Act of Settlement, and they feared lest this might engage him to defend"
1206,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"it;"" and therefore they chose Sir Michael Creagh and Terence Dermot,"
1207,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"their Senior Aldermen, showing pretty clearly that the good citizens of"
1208,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Dublin set little value on the ""furious Popery"" of Prime Sergeant"
1209,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Dillon, in comparison with their property plundered by the Act of"
1210,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,Settlement.
1211,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1212,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,The election for Trinity College is worthy of notice. We have it set
1213,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"out in flaming paragraphs how horribly the College was used, worse than"
1214,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"any other borough, ""Popish Fellows"" being intruded. ""In the house they"
1215,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"placed a Popish garrison, turned the chapel into a magazine, and many"
1216,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"of the chambers into prisons for Protestants."" (King, p. 220, Ed."
1217,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"1744.) Yet, _miraculous_ to say, in the heart of this ""Popish"
1218,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"garrison,"" the ""turned-out Vice-Provost, Fellows, and Scholars"" met,"
1219,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"and elected two most bold, notable, and Protestant Williamites."
1220,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1221,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"If this election could take place in Dublin, under the very nose of the"
1222,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Government, and in a corporation in which the king had unquestioned"
1223,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"control, one will hesitate about the compulsion or exclusion in other"
1224,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,places.
1225,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1226,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Besides Sir John Meade and Mr. Joseph Coghlan, the members for the"
1227,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"College, there ""were four more Protestants returned, of whose behaviour"
1228,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"I can give no account,"" says King. Pity he does not give the names."
1229,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1230,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,If we were to allow a similar error in King's account of the creed of
1231,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"the elected, that we have proved in his lists of the borough electors,"
1232,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,it would raise the number of Protestants in the house to about
1233,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,fourteen.
1234,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1235,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,Allowing then for the Protestants in arms against the Government--out
1236,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"of the country, or within the seat of war--the disproportion between"
1237,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,their representatives and the Roman Catholics will lessen greatly.
1238,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1239,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"One thing more is worth noticing in the Commons, and that is a sort of"
1240,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"sept representation. Thus we see O'Neills in Antrim, Tyrone, and"
1241,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Armagh; Magennises in Down; O'Reillys in Cavan; Martins, Blakes,"
1242,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Kirwans, Dalys, Bourkes for Connaught; MacCarthys, O'Briens, O'Donovans"
1243,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"for Cork and Clare; Farrells for Longford; Graces, Purcells, Butlers,"
1244,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Welshs, Fitzgeralds for Tipperary, Kilkenny, Kildare, etc.; O'Tooles,"
1245,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Byrnes, and Eustaces for Wicklow; MacMahons for Monaghan; Nugents,"
1246,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Bellews, Talbots, etc., for North Leinster."
1247,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1248,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Sir Richard Nagle, the Speaker, was the descendant of an old Norman"
1249,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,family (said to be the same as the Nangles) settled in Cork. His
1250,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"paternal castle, Carrignancurra, is on the edge of a steep rock, over"
1251,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"the meadows of the Blackwater, half-a-dozen miles below Mallow. It is"
1252,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"now the property of the Foot family, and here may still be seen the"
1253,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,mouldering ruin where that subtle lawyer first learned to plan.
1254,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,Peacefully now look the long oak-clad cliffs on the happy river.
1255,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1256,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Nagle had obtained a splendid reputation at the Irish Bar. ""He had been"
1257,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"educated among the Jesuits, and designed for a clergyman,"" says King,"
1258,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"""but afterwards betook himself to the study of the law, in which he"
1259,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"arrived to a good perfection."" Harris, likewise, calls him ""an artful"
1260,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"lawyer of great parts."" Tyrconnell valued him rightly, and brought him"
1261,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,to England with him in the autumn of 1686. His reputation seems to have
1262,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"been great, for it seems the lords interested in the Settlement Act,"
1263,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"""on being informed of Nagle's arrival, were so transported with rage"
1264,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"that they would have had him immediately sent out of London."""
1265,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1266,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"He was knighted, and made attorney-general in 1687; and on James's"
1267,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"arrival, March, 1688-9, he was made secretary of state. He is said, we"
1268,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"know not how truly, to have drafted the Commons' bill for the repeal of"
1269,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,the Settlement.
1270,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1271,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,Let us mention some of the members.--Nagle's colleague in Cork was
1272,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Colonel MacCarty, afterwards Lord Mountcashel. Miles de Courcy,"
1273,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"afterwards Lord Kinsale, MacCarty Reagh, who finally settled in France."
1274,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"His descendant, Count MacCarty Reagh, was notable for having one of the"
1275,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"finest libraries in Europe, which was sold after the Revolution."
1276,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1277,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"The Rt. Hon. Simon Lutteral raised a dragoon regiment for James, and"
1278,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,afterwards commanded the Queen's regiment of infantry in the Brigade.
1279,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"He was father to Colonel Henry Lutteral, accused of having betrayed the"
1280,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,passage of the Shannon at Limerick; and though Harris throws doubt on
1281,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"this particular act of treason, his correspondence and rewards from"
1282,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,William seem sufficient proof and confirmation of his guilt.
1283,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1284,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Lally of Tullendaly, member for Tuam, was the representative of the"
1285,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"O'Lallys, an old Irish sept. His brother, John Gerard Lally, settled in"
1286,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"France, and married a sister to Dillon, ""_colonel propriétaire_"" in the"
1287,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Brigade, and was Colonel commanding in this illustrious regiment. Sir"
1288,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Gerard was father to the famous Count Thomas Lally Tollendal, who,"
1289,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,after having served from the age of twelve to sixty-four in every
1290,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"quarter of the globe, from Barcelona to Dettingen, and from Fontenoy to"
1291,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Pondicherry, was beheaded on the 9th of May, 1766. The Marquis De Lally"
1292,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Tollendal, a distinguished lawyer and statesman of the Bourbonist"
1293,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"party, and writer of the life of Strafford, and many other works, was a"
1294,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"grand-nephew to James Lally, the member for Tuam in '89."
1295,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1296,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Colonel Roger Mac Elligot, who commanded Lord Clancarty's regiment (the"
1297,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"12th infantry) in the Brigade, was member for Ardfert."
1298,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1299,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Limerick.--Sir John Fitzgerald was ""_col. propr._"" of the regiment of"
1300,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,Limerick (8th infantry) in the Brigade.
1301,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1302,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Oliver O'Gara, member for Tulske, was Lieutenant-Colonel of the guards"
1303,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,under Colonel Dorrington.
1304,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1305,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Hugh Mac Mahon, Gordon O'Nials Lieutenant-Colonel, was member for"
1306,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,Monaghan.
1307,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1308,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"The Right Hon. Nicholas Purcell, member for Tipperary, was a Privy"
1309,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Councillor early in James's reign. His family were Barons of Loughmoe,"
1310,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,and of great consideration in those parts.
1311,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,
1312,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,The first bill introduced into the Lords was on the 8th of May--that
1313,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,for the recognition of the king--and the same day committees of
1314,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,grievance were appointed.

1317,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"[26] Hallam (""Constitutional History,"" chaps. 13 and 14) contains"
1318,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"enough to show the uncertainty of the law. Throughout these, as in"
1319,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"all parts of his work, he is a jealous Williamite and a bigoted"
1320,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.,"Whig. His treatment of Curry has been justly censured by Mr. Wyse,"

1329,THE SESSION.,THE SESSION.
1330,THE SESSION.,
1331,THE SESSION.,
1332,THE SESSION.,It is needless for us to track the parliament through the debates of
1333,THE SESSION.,"the session, which lasted till the 20th July. The few acts (thirty-five),"
1334,THE SESSION.,"passed in two months, received full and earnest discussion; committees"
1335,THE SESSION.,and counsel were heard on many of them (the Acts for repealing the
1336,THE SESSION.,"Settlement in particular), and this parliament refused even to adjourn"
1337,THE SESSION.,during any holiday.
1338,THE SESSION.,
1339,THE SESSION.,"We trust our readers will deal like searchers for truth, not like"
1340,THE SESSION.,"polemics, with these documents, and with the history of these times."
1341,THE SESSION.,"But, above all, let them not approach the subject unless it be in a"
1342,THE SESSION.,"spirit enlightened by philosophy and warmed by charity. Thus studied,"
1343,THE SESSION.,"this time, which has been the armoury of faction, may become the temple"
1344,THE SESSION.,of reconciliation. The descendant of the Williamite ought to sympathise
1345,THE SESSION.,"with the urgent patriotism and loyalty of the parliament, rather than"
1346,THE SESSION.,"dwell on its errors, or on the sufferings which civil war inflicted on"
1347,THE SESSION.,his forefathers. The heir of the Jacobite may well be proud of such
1348,THE SESSION.,countrymen as the Inniskilliners and the 'Prentice Boys of Derry. Both
1349,THE SESSION.,"must deplore that the falsehoods, corruption, and forgeries of English"
1350,THE SESSION.,"aristocrats, the imprudence of an English king, and the fickleness of"
1351,THE SESSION.,"the English people placed the noble cavalry which slew Schomberg, and"
1352,THE SESSION.,"all but beat William's immense masses at the Boyne, in opposition to"
1353,THE SESSION.,the stout men of Butler's-bridge and Cavan. What had not the defenders
1354,THE SESSION.,"of Derry and Limerick, the heroes of Athlone, Inniskillen, and Aughrim"
1355,THE SESSION.,"done, had they cordially joined against the alien? Let the Roman"
1356,THE SESSION.,"Catholics, crushed by the Penal Code, let the Protestants, impoverished"
1357,THE SESSION.,"and insulted by England, till, musket in hand and with banners"
1358,THE SESSION.,"displayed, they forced their rights from her in '82--let both look"
1359,THE SESSION.,"narrowly at the causes of those intestine feuds, which have prostrated"
1360,THE SESSION.,"both in turn before the stranger, and see whether much may not be said"
1361,THE SESSION.,"for both sides, and whether half of what each calls crime in the other"
1362,THE SESSION.,"is not his own distrust or his neighbour's ignorance. Knowledge,"
1363,THE SESSION.,"Charity, and Patriotism are the only powers which can loose this"
1364,THE SESSION.,Prometheus-land. Let us seek them daily in our own hearts and
1365,THE SESSION.,conversation.
1366,THE SESSION.,
1367,THE SESSION.,The Acts and other official documents of James's Parliament were
1368,THE SESSION.,"ordered by William's Parliament to be burned, and became extremely"
1369,THE SESSION.,"scarce. In 1740 they were printed in Dublin by Ebenezer Rider, and from"
1370,THE SESSION.,"that collection we propose to reprint the most important of them, as"
1371,THE SESSION.,the best and most solid answer to misrepresentation.
1372,THE SESSION.,
1373,THE SESSION.,The Parliament which passed those Acts was the first and the last which
1374,THE SESSION.,"ever sat in Ireland since the English invasion, possessed of national"
1375,THE SESSION.,"authority, and complete in all its parts. The king, by law and in"
1376,THE SESSION.,"fact--the king who, by his Scottish descent, his creed, and his"
1377,THE SESSION.,"misfortunes, was dear (mistakenly or not) to the majority of the then"
1378,THE SESSION.,people of Ireland--presided in person over that Parliament. The peerage
1379,THE SESSION.,"consisted of the best blood, Milesian and Norman, of great wealth and"
1380,THE SESSION.,"of various creeds. The Commons represented the Irish septs, the Danish"
1381,THE SESSION.,"towns, and the Anglo-Irish counties and boroughs. No Parliament of"
1382,THE SESSION.,"equal rank, from King to Commons, sat here since; none sat here before"
1383,THE SESSION.,or since so national in composition and conduct.
1384,THE SESSION.,
1385,THE SESSION.,"Standing between two dynasties--endangering the one, and almost"
1386,THE SESSION.,rescuing the other--acting for a nation entirely unchained then for the
1387,THE SESSION.,first time in 500 years--this Parliament and its Acts _ought_ to
1388,THE SESSION.,possess the very greatest interest for the historian and the patriot.
1389,THE SESSION.,
1390,THE SESSION.,This was the speech with which his Majesty opened the Session:--
1391,THE SESSION.,
1392,THE SESSION.,"_My Lords and Gentlemen_,"
1393,THE SESSION.,
1394,THE SESSION.,"The Exemplary Loyalty which this Nation hath expressed to me, at a"
1395,THE SESSION.,time when _others_ of my _Subjects undutifully misbehaved
1396,THE SESSION.,"themselves to me, or so basely deserted me_: And your seconding my"
1397,THE SESSION.,"Deputy, as you did, in His Firm and Resolute asserting my Right, in"
1398,THE SESSION.,"preserving this Kingdom for me, and putting it in a Posture of"
1399,THE SESSION.,"Defence; made me resolve to come to you, and to venture my life"
1400,THE SESSION.,"with you, in the defence of your Liberties and my Own Right. And to"
1401,THE SESSION.,"my great Satisfaction I have not only found you ready to serve me,"
1402,THE SESSION.,but that your Courage has equalled your Zeal.
1403,THE SESSION.,
1404,THE SESSION.,"I have always been for Liberty of Conscience, and against invading"
1405,THE SESSION.,any Man's Property; having still in my Mind that Saying in Holy
1406,THE SESSION.,"Writ, _Do as you would be done to, for that is the Law and the"
1407,THE SESSION.,Prophets_.
1408,THE SESSION.,
1409,THE SESSION.,"_It was this Liberty of Conscience I gave, which my Enemies both"
1410,THE SESSION.,Abroad and at Home dreaded; especially when they saw that I was
1411,THE SESSION.,"resolved to have it Established by Law in all my Dominions, and"
1412,THE SESSION.,"made them set themselves up against me_, though for different"
1413,THE SESSION.,"Reasons. Seeing that if I had once settled it, _My people_ (_in"
1414,THE SESSION.,the Opinion of the One_) would have been too happy; and I (_in the
1415,THE SESSION.,Opinion of the Other_) too great.
1416,THE SESSION.,
1417,THE SESSION.,"_This Argument was made use of_, to persuade their own People"
1418,THE SESSION.,"to joyn with them, and to many of my Subjects to use me as they"
1419,THE SESSION.,have done. But nothing shall ever persuade me to change my Mind as
1420,THE SESSION.,"to that; and wheresoever I am the Master, I design (God willing) to"
1421,THE SESSION.,Establish it by Law; and have no other Test or Distinction but that
1422,THE SESSION.,of Loyalty.
1423,THE SESSION.,
1424,THE SESSION.,"I expect your Concurrence in so Christian a Work, and in making"
1425,THE SESSION.,Laws against Prophaneness and all Sorts of Debauchery.
1426,THE SESSION.,
1427,THE SESSION.,I shall also most readily consent to the making such Good and
1428,THE SESSION.,"Wholesome Laws as may be for the general Good of the Nation, the"
1429,THE SESSION.,"Improvement of Trade, and the relieving of such as have been"
1430,THE SESSION.,"injured by the late _Acts of Settlement_, as far forth as may"
1431,THE SESSION.,"be consistent with Reason, Justice, and the Publick Good of my"
1432,THE SESSION.,People.
1433,THE SESSION.,
1434,THE SESSION.,"And as I shall do my Part to make you Happy and Rich, I make no"
1435,THE SESSION.,Doubt of your Assistance; by enabling me to oppose the unjust
1436,THE SESSION.,"Designs of my Enemies, and to make this Nation flourish."
1437,THE SESSION.,
1438,THE SESSION.,"And to encourage you the more to it, you know with what Ardour and"
1439,THE SESSION.,Generosity and Kindness the Most Christian King gave a secure
1440,THE SESSION.,"retreat to the Queen, my Son, and Myself, when we were forced out"
1441,THE SESSION.,"of _England_, and came to seek for Protection and Safety in his"
1442,THE SESSION.,"Dominions; how he embraced my Interest, and gave me such Supplies"
1443,THE SESSION.,"of all Sorts as enabled me to come to you; which, without his"
1444,THE SESSION.,"obliging Assistance, I could not have done: _This he did_ at a Time"
1445,THE SESSION.,when he had so many and so considerable Enemies to deal with: _and
1446,THE SESSION.,you see still continues to do_.
1447,THE SESSION.,
1448,THE SESSION.,"I shall conclude as I have begun, and assure you I am as sensible"
1449,THE SESSION.,as you can desire of the signal Loyalty you have expressed to me;
1450,THE SESSION.,and shall make it my chief study (as it always has been) to make
1451,THE SESSION.,you and all my Subjects happy.

1512,CHAPTER IX.,
1513,CHAPTER X.,CHAPTER X.
1514,CHAPTER X.,
1515,CHAPTER X.,An Act of Supply for his Majesty for the Support of his Army.
1516,CHAPTER X.,
1517,CHAPTER X.,[The Act of Supply begins by giving good reasons for the making of it;
1518,CHAPTER X.,"namely, that the army cost far more than the king's revenue, and that"
1519,CHAPTER X.,that army was rendered necessary from the invasion of Ireland by the
1520,CHAPTER X.,"English rebels. It next grants the king £20,000 a month, to be raised"
1521,CHAPTER X.,"by a land-tax, and this sum it distributes on the different counties"
1522,CHAPTER X.,"and counties of towns, according to their abilities. The rebellious"
1523,CHAPTER X.,counties of Fermanagh and Derry are taxed just as lightly as if they
1524,CHAPTER X.,"were loyal. The names of the commissioners are, beyond doubt, those of"
1525,CHAPTER X.,the first men in their respective counties. The rank of the country was
1526,CHAPTER X.,as palpably on James's side as was the populace.
1527,CHAPTER X.,
1528,CHAPTER X.,The clauses regarding the tenants are remarkably clear and liberal:
1529,CHAPTER X.,"""For as much,"" it says, ""as it would be hard that the tenants should"
1530,CHAPTER X.,"bear _any_ proportion of the said sum, considering that it is very"
1531,CHAPTER X.,"difficult for the tenant to pay his rent in these distracted times,"" it"
1532,CHAPTER X.,"goes on to provide that the tax shall, in the first instance, be paid"
1533,CHAPTER X.,"by the occupier, but that, where land is let at its value, he shall be"

1706,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,
1707,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,
1708,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"It appears from the Journal of the proceedings of the parliament, and"
1709,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"from many other authorities, that no act of the Irish Parliament of"
1710,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,1689 received such full consideration as the following. Two bills were
1711,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,brought in for the purpose of repealing the acts of settlement--that
1712,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"into the House of Lords, on May 13, by Chief Justice Nugent; that into"
1713,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,the House of Commons by Lord Riverstown and Colonel MacCarthy.
1714,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,Committees sat to inquire into the effects of the bills; many memorials
1715,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"were read and considered; counsel were heard, both generally on the"
1716,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"bills and on their effects on individuals; the debates were long, and"
1717,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,it was not till after several conferences between the two houses that
1718,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,the act passed. The act was deliberately and maturely considered.
1719,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,
1720,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,The titles and some of the effects of the acts of settlement are given
1721,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,in the preamble to the following statute. The effect of those acts of
1722,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"settlement had been, in a great degree, to confirm the unprincipled"
1723,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"distribution of Irish property, made by Cromwell's government, amongst"
1724,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"those who had served it best, or, what meant nearly the same thing, who"
1725,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,had most injured the Irish. The acts of settlement gave legality to a
1726,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,revolution which transferred the lands of the natives to military
1727,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"colonists. The repeal of those acts, within 24 years after they passed,"
1728,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"and within about 37 years after that revolution took place, cannot"
1729,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,excite much surprise. The _one-third_ of their holdings (which the
1730,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,Cromwellian soldiers were obliged by the acts of the settlement to give
1731,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,up) could not have made a fund to reprize those who had been ousted
1732,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"from the entire. However, the giving up of that one-third was not"
1733,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"strictly enforced, and the stock resulting was wasted by commissioners,"
1734,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"and distributed as the applicants had interest at court, not as they"
1735,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"had title to the lands. Thus, Lord Ormond got some HUNDRED THOUSAND"
1736,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"acres; albeit he had done more substantial injury to the Irish, and to"
1737,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"the royalist cause in which they foolishly embarked, than any of the"
1738,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"parliamentarians, from Coote to Ireton. Under such circumstances, we"
1739,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"are not exaggerating the effect of the acts of settlement, passed after"
1740,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"the Restoration, in saying, that they confirmed by law the Cromwellian"
1741,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,robbery. The testimony of all the credible writers of the time goes to
1742,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"the same effect. Indeed, the repeal of the acts of settlement would"
1743,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"have been against the interests of the natives, if they had received"
1744,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"justice from those acts. This, in itself, is sufficient to prove how"
1745,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"much hardship they had caused. The repeal of those acts by the Irish,"
1746,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"as soon as they were in power, seems natural, considering how great and"
1747,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"how recent was the injury they inflicted. Still, as we said, 24 years"
1748,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,had passed since those acts had become law. Many persons had got
1749,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"possession of properties under that law, and many of those properties"
1750,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"had, doubtless, been sold, leased, subdivided, improved, and"
1751,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"incumbered, upon the faith of that law. It might be urged that persons"
1752,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,interested by such means in these properties had become so with full
1753,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"knowledge that they had been acquired by violence and injustice, and"
1754,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"that the original owners and their families were in existence, ready"
1755,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,and resolved to take their first opportunity of regaining their rights.
1756,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"Such reasoning fixes all who had advanced money, made purchases, or"
1757,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"become in any wise interested under the acts of settlement, with such"
1758,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,injustice and imprudence as to diminish their claim for compensation
1759,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"upon the repeal of those acts. But it only diminished, it did not"
1760,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,destroy that claim. All those persons reposed some confidence in the
1761,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,security of the then existing government; and many of them found a
1762,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"justification for the Cromwellian conquest, in the conduct of the"
1763,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"Irish, as the well-sustained falsehoods of the English describe it."
1764,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,
1765,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"For these reasons, Chief Justice Keating prepared a long memorial,"
1766,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"which Forbes, Lord Granard, presented to the king, during the"
1767,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"discussions on the bills, in May, 1689, setting forth the claims of"
1768,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"those who came in under the acts of settlement, as incumbrancers,"
1769,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"purchasers, tenants, by marriage, etc. This memorial is dishonestly"
1770,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"represented by the Whig writers, as directed against the repeal"
1771,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,altogether; but any one who reads it (which he can do in the appendix
1772,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,to Harris's life of William) will find that it is an argument in favour
1773,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,of the classes described in the last sentence. From the long and
1774,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"careful clauses in the following act, for the reprisal and compensation"
1775,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"of those classes, we must infer that Keating's memorial produced its"
1776,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"intended effect. However, these clauses require to be carefully"
1777,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"examined, to see whether they carry out this principle of compensation"
1778,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,fairly and impartially. The character of this parliament for moderation
1779,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,depends greatly on their doings in this respect.
1780,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,
1781,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"We now come to a second class, the Irish who, having been given the"
1782,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"alternative of ""Hell or Connaught"" (as a certain bishop was of Heaven"
1783,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"or Dungarvan), preferred the latter, and were located on the lands of"
1784,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,the Connaught people. This class would generally come in for their old
1785,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"holdings in the other provinces, and required no compensation; but the"
1786,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"distribution, under this act, of the incumbrances, etc., between them"
1787,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"and the owners of their former and present lands, seems lawyer-like and"
1788,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,reasonable.
1789,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,
1790,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"The next great class are the ""adventurers,"" those who got lands during"
1791,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"the Commonwealth, and whose holdings were confirmed by the settlement."
1792,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"Their claim was boldly and ably urged by Anthony Dopping, bishop of"
1793,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"Meath. His speech on the Repeal Bill is given in King's appendix, and"
1794,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,is worth reading. He bases their claim upon the supposition of the
1795,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"Irish having been bloody rebels, rightly punished by the giving of"
1796,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,their lands to their loyal conquerors. His speech gives the genuine
1797,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"opinion of the English at the time. The preamble to the following act,"
1798,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"and that to the Commons' bill, give the Irish view of the war. These"
1799,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,documents deny that the bulk of the Irish were engaged in the
1800,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"conspiracy of 1641; and the denial is true, although it is also true"
1801,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"that more than a ""few indigent persons"" engaged in it, as is plain from"
1802,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,Lord Maguire's narrative; and although it might have more become this
1803,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,Irish parliament to proclaim the absolute justice of the rising of
1804,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"1641, on account of the sufferings of all ranks of Irish, in property"
1805,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,and in political and religious rights; while they might have lamented
1806,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"that English atrocities had led to a cruel retaliation, though one"
1807,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"infinitely less than it has been represented. However, the parliament,"
1808,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"probably from delicacy to the king, based the rights of the Irish upon"
1809,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"the peace of 1684, and the Restoration as restoring them to their"
1810,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"loyalty, and to the properties possessed in 1641."
1811,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,
1812,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,Most fair inquirers will allow the justice of this restoration of the
1813,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,Irish; but will lament that the act before us contains no provision for
1814,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"the families of those adventurers, who, however guilty when they came"
1815,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"into the country, had been in it for from thirty to forty years, and"
1816,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,had time and some citizenship in their favour. There had been sound
1817,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"policy in that too, but it was not done; and though the open hostility"
1818,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,of most of those adventurers to the government--though the wants and
1819,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"urgency of the old proprietors, added to a lively recollection of the"
1820,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"horrors which thronged about their advent, may be urged in favour of"
1821,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"leaving them to work out their own livelihood by hard industry, or to"
1822,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"return to England, we cannot be quite reconciled to the wisdom of the"
1823,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"course. Yet, let any one who finds himself eager to condemn the Irish"
1824,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"Parliament on this account read over the facts that led to it, namely:"
1825,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,the conquest of Leinster before the Reformation; the settlements of
1826,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"Munster and Ulster, under Elizabeth and James; the governments of"
1827,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"Strafford, and Parsons, and Borlace; Cromwell's and Ireton's conquest;"
1828,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"the effects of the acts of settlement, and the false-plot reign of"
1829,REPEAL OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT.,"Charles II.; let them, we say, read these, and be at least moderate in"

2310,CONCLUSION.,CONCLUSION.
2311,CONCLUSION.,
2312,CONCLUSION.,
2313,CONCLUSION.,Let us now run our eyes ever the deeds of the Feis or parliament of
2314,CONCLUSION.,1689. It came into power at the end of a half century of which the
2315,CONCLUSION.,"beginning was a civil and religious, social and proprietal persecution,"
2316,CONCLUSION.,combining all the atrocities to which Ireland had been alternatively
2317,CONCLUSION.,"subject for four centuries and a half. Of this, the next stage was a"
2318,CONCLUSION.,"partial insurrection, rendered universal by a bloody and rapacious"
2319,CONCLUSION.,"government. The next stage was a war, in which civil and religious"
2320,CONCLUSION.,quarrels were so fiendishly combined that it could not end while there
2321,CONCLUSION.,was any one to fight with; in which the royalist dignitaries were the
2322,CONCLUSION.,"cruelest foes of the royalist armies and people, and in which the"
2323,CONCLUSION.,services done by cool and patriot soldiers were rendered useless by
2324,CONCLUSION.,"factious theologians. The next stage was conquest, slaughter, exile,"
2325,CONCLUSION.,"confiscation, and the repose of solitude or of slavery. The next was a"
2326,CONCLUSION.,"Restoration which gave back its worst prerogatives to the crown, but"
2327,CONCLUSION.,gave the restorers and royalists only a skirt of their properties. Then
2328,CONCLUSION.,"came a struggle for proprietal justice and religious toleration, met by"
2329,CONCLUSION.,an infamous conspiracy of the deceptious aristocracy and the fanatic
2330,CONCLUSION.,"people of England, to blast the characters of the Irish, and decimate"
2331,CONCLUSION.,"the men; and lastly, a king, who strained his prerogative to do them"
2332,CONCLUSION.,"justice, is driven from England by a Dutchman, supported by blue"
2333,CONCLUSION.,"guards, black guards, and flaming lies, and is forced to throw himself"
2334,CONCLUSION.,on the generosity and prudence of Ireland.
2335,CONCLUSION.,
2336,CONCLUSION.,A faction existed who raised a civil war in every province; and in
2337,CONCLUSION.,"every province, save one, it was suppressed; but in that one it"
2338,CONCLUSION.,"continued, and the sails of an invading fleet already flap in the"
2339,CONCLUSION.,Channel breeze when this parliament is summoned.
2340,CONCLUSION.,
2341,CONCLUSION.,"How difficult was their position! How could they act as freemen,"
2342,CONCLUSION.,without appearing ungenerous to a refugee and benefactor king? How
2343,CONCLUSION.,"guard their nationality, without quarrelling with him or alienating"
2344,CONCLUSION.,England from him? How could they do that proprietal justice and grant
2345,CONCLUSION.,that religious liberty for which the country had been struggling? How
2346,CONCLUSION.,check civil war--how sustain a war by the resources of a distracted
2347,CONCLUSION.,"country? Yet all this the Irish parliament did, and more too; for they"
2348,CONCLUSION.,established the principal parts of a code needful for the _permanent_
2349,CONCLUSION.,liberty and prosperity of Ireland.
2350,CONCLUSION.,
2351,CONCLUSION.,Take up the list of acts passed in their session of seventy-two days
2352,CONCLUSION.,and run over them. They begin by recognising their lawful king who had
2353,CONCLUSION.,thrown himself among them. They pledge themselves to him against his
2354,CONCLUSION.,"powerful foe. Knowing full well the struggle that was before them, and"
2355,CONCLUSION.,"that lukewarm and malcontent agents might ruin them, they tossed aside"
2356,CONCLUSION.,"those official claims, which in times of peace and safety should be"
2357,CONCLUSION.,sacred.
2358,CONCLUSION.,
2359,CONCLUSION.,But their next act deserves more notice. It must not be forgotten that
2360,CONCLUSION.,"Molyneux's ""Case of Ireland,"" which the parliaments of England and"
2361,CONCLUSION.,"Ireland first burnt, and ended by declaring and enacting as sound law,"
2362,CONCLUSION.,"was published in 1699, just ten years after this parliament of James's."
2363,CONCLUSION.,"Doubtless the antique rights of the native Irish, the comparative"
2364,CONCLUSION.,"independence of the Pale, the arguments of Darcy, the memory of the"
2365,CONCLUSION.,"council of Kilkenny, might suggest to Molyneux those principles of"
2366,CONCLUSION.,"independence, which one of his cast of mind would hardly reach by"
2367,CONCLUSION.,"general reasoning. But why go so far back, and to so much less apt"
2368,CONCLUSION.,"precedents? Here, in the parliament of 1689, was a law made declaring"
2369,CONCLUSION.,"Ireland to be and to have always been a ""distinct kingdom"" from"
2370,CONCLUSION.,"England; ""always governed by his majesty and his predecessors according"
2371,CONCLUSION.,"to the ancient customs, laws, and statutes thereof, and that the"
2372,CONCLUSION.,"parliament of Ireland, and that _alone_, could make laws to bind this"
2373,CONCLUSION.,"kingdom;"" and expressly enacting and declaring that no law save such as"
2374,CONCLUSION.,the Irish parliament might make should bind Ireland. And this act
2375,CONCLUSION.,"prohibited all English jurisdiction in Ireland, and all appeals to the"
2376,CONCLUSION.,English peers or to any other court out of Ireland. Is not this the
2377,CONCLUSION.,"whole argument of Molyneux, the hope of Swift and Lucas, the attempt of"
2378,CONCLUSION.,"Flood, the achievement of Grattan and the Volunteers? Is not this an"
2379,CONCLUSION.,"epitome of the Protestant patriot attempts, from the Revolution to the"
2380,CONCLUSION.,"Dungannon Convention? Is not this the soul of '82? Surely, if it be, as"
2381,CONCLUSION.,"it is, just to track the stream of liberation back to Molyneux, we"
2382,CONCLUSION.,should not stop there; but when we find that a parliament which sat
2383,CONCLUSION.,"only ten years before his book was published, which must have been a"
2384,CONCLUSION.,daily subject of conversation--as it certainly was of written
2385,CONCLUSION.,polemics--during those ten years; when we find this upper fountain so
2386,CONCLUSION.,"obviously streaming into the thought of Molyneux, should we not"
2387,CONCLUSION.,"associate the parliament of 1689 with that of 1782, and place Nagle and"
2388,CONCLUSION.,Rice and its other ruling spirits along with Flood and Grattan in our
2389,CONCLUSION.,gratitude?
2390,CONCLUSION.,
2391,CONCLUSION.,"Moreover, the lords and commons expressly repealed Poyning's law, and"
2392,CONCLUSION.,"passed a bill creating Irish Inns of Court, and abolishing the rules"
2393,CONCLUSION.,for keeping terms in London. But the king rejected these. We are to
2394,CONCLUSION.,this day without this benefit which the senate of '89 tried to give us;
2395,CONCLUSION.,and the future advocates and judges of Ireland are hauled off to a
2396,CONCLUSION.,foreign and dissolute capital to go through an idle and expensive
2397,CONCLUSION.,"ceremony, term after term, as an essential to being allowed to practise"
2398,CONCLUSION.,in the courts of this their native kingdom.
2399,CONCLUSION.,
2400,CONCLUSION.,"The Act (c. 4.) for restoring the ancient gentry to their possessions,"
2401,CONCLUSION.,we have already canvassed. It were monstrous to suppose the parliament
2402,CONCLUSION.,ought to have respected the thirty-eight years' usurpation of savage
2403,CONCLUSION.,"invaders, and to have overlooked the rights of the national chieftains,"
2404,CONCLUSION.,"the plundered proprietors who lived, and whose families lived, to claim"
2405,CONCLUSION.,their rights. The care with which purchasers and incumbrancers were to
2406,CONCLUSION.,be reprized we have already noticed; yet we cannot but repeat our
2407,CONCLUSION.,regret that the bill of the Lords (which left the adventurers of
2408,CONCLUSION.,Cromwell a moiety of their usurpations) did not pass.
2409,CONCLUSION.,
2410,CONCLUSION.,"Naturally related to this are the Acts, c. 24, for vesting attainted"
2411,CONCLUSION.,"absentees' goods in the King, and c. 30, attainting a number of"
2412,CONCLUSION.,"insurgents. We have already shown from King, that the Whigs had taken"
2413,CONCLUSION.,"good care of the two things forfeited--their chattels, which they had"
2414,CONCLUSION.,"sent to them, without opposition, during the month of March, and their"
2415,CONCLUSION.,"persons, which they put under the guard of the gallant insurgents of"
2416,CONCLUSION.,"Derry and Fermanagh, or in the keeping of William and the charity of"
2417,CONCLUSION.,England. How poorly they were treated then in England may be guessed at
2418,CONCLUSION.,by the choice men of the impoverished defenders of Derry having been
2419,CONCLUSION.,"left without money, aye, or even clothing or food in the streets of"
2420,CONCLUSION.,London.
2421,CONCLUSION.,
2422,CONCLUSION.,We heartily censure this Attainder Act. It was _the_ mistake of the
2423,CONCLUSION.,Irish Parliament. It bound up the hearts and interests of those who
2424,CONCLUSION.,"were named in it, and of their children, in William's success. It could"
2425,CONCLUSION.,not be enforced: they were absent. It could not be terrible till
2426,CONCLUSION.,"victory sanctioned it, and then it would be needless and cruel to"
2427,CONCLUSION.,"execute. Yet, let us judge the men rightly. James had been hunted out"
2428,CONCLUSION.,"of England by lies, treachery, bigotry, cabal, and a Dutch invader, for"
2429,CONCLUSION.,"having attempted to grant religious liberty, by his prerogative. Those"
2430,CONCLUSION.,"attainted were, nine out of ten, in arms against him and their country."
2431,CONCLUSION.,They had been repeatedly offered free pardon. Just before the Act was
2432,CONCLUSION.,"brought in, a free pardon, excepting only ten persons, was offered, yet"
2433,CONCLUSION.,"few of the insurgents came in; and James, instead of forbidding"
2434,CONCLUSION.,"quarter, or hanging his prisoners, or any other of the acts of rigour"
2435,CONCLUSION.,"usual in hereditary governments down to our own time, consented to an"
2436,CONCLUSION.,"Act requiring the chief persons of the insurrection to come, in periods"
2437,CONCLUSION.,"specified, and amply long enough, to stand their trials. Certain it is,"
2438,CONCLUSION.,"as we said before, that though many of these were or became prisoners,"
2439,CONCLUSION.,none were executed. The Act was a dead letter; and considering the
2440,CONCLUSION.,"principles of the time, surely the Act was not wonderful."
2441,CONCLUSION.,
2442,CONCLUSION.,"In order, then, to judge them better, let us see what the other"
2443,CONCLUSION.,"side--the immaculate Whigs, who assailed the Irish--did when they were"
2444,CONCLUSION.,in power. Of anything previous to the Revolution--of the treachery and
2445,CONCLUSION.,"blood, by law and without law, under the Plantagenets, Tudors, Stuarts,"
2446,CONCLUSION.,and the Commonwealth--'tis needless to speak. But let us see what their
2447,CONCLUSION.,"neighbours, the Williamites, did."
2448,CONCLUSION.,
2449,CONCLUSION.,"The Irish Attainder Act was not brought in till the end of June. Now,"
2450,CONCLUSION.,"this is of great value, for the dates of the last papers on Ireland,"
2451,CONCLUSION.,"laid before the English Commons, having been 10th June, 1689, they, on"
2452,CONCLUSION.,"the 20th June, ""_Resolved_, that leave be given to bring in a Bill to"
2453,CONCLUSION.,"attaint of high treason certain persons who are now in Ireland, or any"

2455,CONCLUSION.,"shall not return into England by a certain day.""[29]"
2456,CONCLUSION.,
2457,CONCLUSION.,"The very next entry is--""A Bill for the attainting certain persons of"
2458,CONCLUSION.,"high treason, was read the first time."" ""_Resolved,_ that the Bill be"
2459,CONCLUSION.,"read a second time."""
2460,CONCLUSION.,
2461,CONCLUSION.,Here was a bill to attaint persons beyond seas in another kingdom where
2462,CONCLUSION.,William had never been acknowledged--where James was welcomed by nine
2463,CONCLUSION.,"men out of ten--from whence, so far from being able to procure evidence"
2464,CONCLUSION.,"or allow defence, they could but by accident get intelligence and"
2465,CONCLUSION.,reports once in some months. It is not here pretended that the
2466,CONCLUSION.,attainted were habitual residents in England. The bill passed the
2467,CONCLUSION.,"second reading, and was committeed, June 22nd, with an instruction to"
2468,CONCLUSION.,"the committee, ""That they insert into the bill such other of the"
2469,CONCLUSION.,"persons as were this day _named in the house_, as they shall find"
2470,CONCLUSION.,"cause."""
2471,CONCLUSION.,
2472,CONCLUSION.,"Again, on the 24th--""_Ordered_, that it be an instruction to the"
2473,CONCLUSION.,"committee, to whom the bill for attainting certain persons is referred,"
2474,CONCLUSION.,that they prepare and bring in a clause for the _immediate_ seizing the

2476,CONCLUSION.,"the late King James in Ireland, or in his service in France."" On the"
2477,CONCLUSION.,"29th is another instruction to ""prepare and bring in a clause that the"
2478,CONCLUSION.,estates of the persons who are now in rebellion (!) in Ireland be
2479,CONCLUSION.,applied to the relief of the Irish Protestants fled into this realm;
2480,CONCLUSION.,and also to declare all the proceedings of the pretended parliament and

2482,CONCLUSION.,"committee ""to sit _de die in diem_, till the bill be finished."""
2483,CONCLUSION.,
2484,CONCLUSION.,Up to this time they could not have known that any attainder act had
2485,CONCLUSION.,"been brought in in Ireland. On the 9th July, Sergeant Trenchard"
2486,CONCLUSION.,"reported, ""That the committee had _proof_"" (we shall presently see of"
2487,CONCLUSION.,"what kind) ""of _several other_ persons being in Ireland in arms with"
2488,CONCLUSION.,"King James, and therefore had agreed their names should be inserted in"
2489,CONCLUSION.,"the bill."" ""Ordered, that the bill, so amended, be engrossed."" On the"
2490,CONCLUSION.,"11th July the bill passed, inserting _August_, 1689, instead of August"
2491,CONCLUSION.,"next, and inserting some Christian names."
2492,CONCLUSION.,
2493,CONCLUSION.,The bill reached the Lords.
2494,CONCLUSION.,
2495,CONCLUSION.,Upon the 24th July a message was sent to the Lords urging the despatch
2496,CONCLUSION.,"of the bill. On the 2nd August, at a conference, the Lords required to"
2497,CONCLUSION.,"know _on what evidence_ the names were introduced as being in Ireland,"
2498,CONCLUSION.,"""for, upon their best inquiry, they say they cannot learn some of them"
2499,CONCLUSION.,"have been there--they instanced the Lord Hunsden."" On the 3rd of"
2500,CONCLUSION.,"August, Mr. Sergeant Trenchard acquaints the house that the names of"
2501,CONCLUSION.,those who gave evidence at the bar of the house touching the persons
2502,CONCLUSION.,"who are named in the bill of attainder, being in Ireland, were Bazill"
2503,CONCLUSION.,"Purefoy and William Dalton; and those at the committee, to whom the"
2504,CONCLUSION.,"bill was referred, were William Watts and Math. Gun; four persons, two"
2505,CONCLUSION.,and two giving the whole evidence for the attainder of those who stood
2506,CONCLUSION.,by King James in Ireland! This report was handed to the Lords on the
2507,CONCLUSION.,5th August.
2508,CONCLUSION.,
2509,CONCLUSION.,"On the 20th August the Lords returned the bill, with some amendments,"
2510,CONCLUSION.,"leaving out Lord Hunsden and four or five more, and inserting a few"
2511,CONCLUSION.,others; and upon this day the parliament was prorogued.
2512,CONCLUSION.,
2513,CONCLUSION.,"Again, on the 30th October, a bill was ordered to attaint all such"
2514,CONCLUSION.,persons as were in rebellion against their Majesties. On the 26th
2515,CONCLUSION.,"November, certain members were ordered to prepare a bill attainting all"
2516,CONCLUSION.,"who had been in arms against William and Mary, since _14th February_,"
2517,CONCLUSION.,"1688-9, or any time since, and all who _have been_, or shall be,"
2518,CONCLUSION.,"_aiding, assisting, or abetting_ them. On the 10th December the bill"
2519,CONCLUSION.,"was reported and read a first time, and the committee ordered to bring"
2520,CONCLUSION.,in a bill for sale of the estates forfeited thereby.
2521,CONCLUSION.,
2522,CONCLUSION.,"On the 4th April, 1690, another bill was ordered, and was read 22nd"
2523,CONCLUSION.,April.
2524,CONCLUSION.,
2525,CONCLUSION.,"Again, on 22nd October, another attainder and confiscation bill was"
2526,CONCLUSION.,brought and passed the Commons on the 23rd December.
2527,CONCLUSION.,
2528,CONCLUSION.,"Wearied at length by unsuccessful bills, which the better or more"
2529,CONCLUSION.,"interested feeling of the Lords, or the policy of the King, perpetually"
2530,CONCLUSION.,"defeated, they abandoned any further attainder bills, and merely"
2531,CONCLUSION.,advertized for money on the forfeited lands in Ireland.
2532,CONCLUSION.,
2533,CONCLUSION.,The attainders in _court_ might satisfy them. The commissioners of
2534,CONCLUSION.,"forfeitures, under 10 William III., c. 9, reported to the Commons on"
2535,CONCLUSION.,"the 15th of December, 1699, that the persons outlawed for treason in"
2536,CONCLUSION.,"Ireland since the 13th of February, 1688-9, on account of the late"
2537,CONCLUSION.,"rebellion, were 3,921 in number. It was abominable for James's"
2538,CONCLUSION.,"parliament to attaint conditionally the rebels against the old king,"
2539,CONCLUSION.,but reasonable for the Whigs to attaint about double the number
2540,CONCLUSION.,"absolutely, for never having recognized the new king! These 3,921 had"
2541,CONCLUSION.,"properties, says the report, to the amount of 1,060,792 _plantation_"
2542,CONCLUSION.,"acres, worth £211,623 a year, and worth in money, £2,685,130, ""besides"
2543,CONCLUSION.,the several denominations in the said several counties to which no
2544,CONCLUSION.,"number of acres can be added, by reason of the imperfection of the"
2545,CONCLUSION.,"surveys not here valued."" Of these 3,921, there were 491 restored under"
2546,CONCLUSION.,the first commission on the articles of Galway and Limerick; and 792
2547,CONCLUSION.,"under the second commission, having joint properties of 233,106 acres,"
2548,CONCLUSION.,"worth £55,763 a year, or £724,923 purchase, leaving 2,638 persons"
2549,CONCLUSION.,"having 827,686 acres, worth £155,859 a year, or £1,960,206. Yet the"
2550,CONCLUSION.,"fees were monstrous, says the commissioners, in these Courts of Claims,"
2551,CONCLUSION.,£5 being the register's fees for even _entering_ a claim. William
2552,CONCLUSION.,"restored property to the amount of 74,733 acres, worth £20,066 per"
2553,CONCLUSION.,"annum, or £260,863 in all, which would leave as absolutely forfeited"
2554,CONCLUSION.,"property 752,953 acres, worth £135,793 a year, and £1,699,343 in all;"
2555,CONCLUSION.,"and even were we to deduct in proportion, which we ought not, as those"
2556,CONCLUSION.,"pardoned were chiefly the very wealthy few, there would remain over"
2557,CONCLUSION.,"2,400 persons attained by office, after deducting all who carved out"
2558,CONCLUSION.,"their acquittal with shot and sword, and all whom the tenderness or"
2559,CONCLUSION.,wisdom of the king pardoned.
2560,CONCLUSION.,
2561,CONCLUSION.,"The commissioners state that £300,000 worth of chattels were seized,"
2562,CONCLUSION.,"not included in the above estimate; nor were 297 houses in Dublin, 26"
2563,CONCLUSION.,"in Cork, 226 elsewhere, mills, chief rents, £60,000 worth of woods,"
2564,CONCLUSION.,"etc., in it."
2565,CONCLUSION.,
2566,CONCLUSION.,Most of these properties had been given away freely by William. Amongst
2567,CONCLUSION.,"his grants they specify all King James's estates, over 95,000 acres,"
2568,CONCLUSION.,"worth £25,995 a year, to Mrs. Elizabeth Villiers, Countess of Orkney."
2569,CONCLUSION.,"She was William's favourite mistress. James, to his honour be it"
2570,CONCLUSION.,"spoken, had thrown these estates into the general fund for reprisal of"
2571,CONCLUSION.,the injured Irish.
2572,CONCLUSION.,
2573,CONCLUSION.,"Here, then, is certainly not a justification of the Parliament of 1689,"
2574,CONCLUSION.,"in passing the Attainder Act, but evidence from the journals of the"
2575,CONCLUSION.,"English Parliament and the reports of their commissioners, that they"
2576,CONCLUSION.,tried to do worse than the Irish Parliament (under far greater excuses)
2577,CONCLUSION.,"are accused of having done, and that the actual amount of punishment"
2578,CONCLUSION.,_inflicted_ by the Williamite courts in Ireland far exceeded what the
2579,CONCLUSION.,Irish Parliament of 1689 had _conditionally threatened_.
2580,CONCLUSION.,
2581,CONCLUSION.,"The next Acts as a class are c. 9, repealing ministers' money act; c."
2582,CONCLUSION.,"12, granting perfect liberty of conscience to men of all creeds; c. 13,"
2583,CONCLUSION.,directing Roman Catholics to pay their tithes to their own priests; c.
2584,CONCLUSION.,"14, on Ulster poundage; c. 15, appointing those tithes to the _parish_"
2585,CONCLUSION.,"priests, and recognising as a Roman Catholic prelate no one but him"
2586,CONCLUSION.,whom the king under privy signet and sign manual should signify and
2587,CONCLUSION.,"recognize as such. All these acts went to create religious equality,"
2588,CONCLUSION.,certainly not the voluntary system; neither party approved of it then;
2589,CONCLUSION.,"but to make the Protestant support his own minister, and the Roman"
2590,CONCLUSION.,"Catholic his own, without violation of conscience, or a shadow of"
2591,CONCLUSION.,supremacy. The low salaries (£100 to £200 a year) of the Roman Catholic
2592,CONCLUSION.,"prelates, and their exclusion from Parliament, were in the same"
2593,CONCLUSION.,moderate spirit.
2594,CONCLUSION.,
2595,CONCLUSION.,"Again, this Parliament introduced the Statute of Frauds (which, having"
2596,CONCLUSION.,"been set aside, was not adopted until the 7th William III.); Acts for"
2597,CONCLUSION.,"relief of poor debtors, for the speedy recovery of wages, and for"
2598,CONCLUSION.,ratifying wills and deeds by persons out of possession.
2599,CONCLUSION.,
2600,CONCLUSION.,"Chapter 21, forbidding the importation of foreign coals, was designed"
2601,CONCLUSION.,to render this country independent of English trade. At that time the
2602,CONCLUSION.,bogs were larger and the people fewer. Their opinion that this
2603,CONCLUSION.,"importation which ""hindered the industry of several poor people and"
2604,CONCLUSION.,"labourers who might have employed themselves"" in supplying the cities,"
2605,CONCLUSION.,"etc., with turf, reminds us of Mr. Laing's most able notice in his"
2606,CONCLUSION.,"""Norway"" of the immense employment to men, women, and children, by the"
2607,CONCLUSION.,cutting of firewood; and what a powerful means this is of doing that
2608,CONCLUSION.,"which is as important as the production of wealth, the diffusion of it"
2609,CONCLUSION.,"without any great inequality through all classes. Part of c. 29,"
2610,CONCLUSION.,"encouraging trade, laying heavy import duties on English goods, and"
2611,CONCLUSION.,"giving privileges to Irish ships over foreign, especially over English,"
2612,CONCLUSION.,"was the result of sound, practical patriotism. It was necessary to"
2613,CONCLUSION.,"guard our trade, manufactures, and shipping against the rivalry of a"
2614,CONCLUSION.,"near, rich, and aspiring neighbour, that would crush them in their"
2615,CONCLUSION.,cradles. It was wise to raise the energies of infant adventure by
2616,CONCLUSION.,"favour, and not trust it in a reckless competition. The example, too,"
2617,CONCLUSION.,of all countries which had reared up commerce by their own favour and
2618,CONCLUSION.,"their neighbours' surrender of trade, would have justified them."
2619,CONCLUSION.,
2620,CONCLUSION.,"Besides the schools for the Navy under c. 29, c. 16 deals also with"
2621,CONCLUSION.,"schools. We have not the latter Act; but, considering James's known"
2622,CONCLUSION.,"zeal for education, his foundation of the Kilkenny college, and the"
2623,CONCLUSION.,"spirit of the provision in c. 29, we may guess the liberality of the"
2624,CONCLUSION.,other. One of the most distinguished of our living historians has told
2625,CONCLUSION.,us that he remembered having seen evidence that this Act established a
2626,CONCLUSION.,school for general (national) education in every parish in Ireland.
2627,CONCLUSION.,
2628,CONCLUSION.,"C. 10, the Act of Supply; c. 25, Martial Law, and this Act, c. 29, were"
2629,CONCLUSION.,a code of defence. The supply was proportioned to their abilities:
2630,CONCLUSION.,"every exertion was made, and all efforts were needed. Plowden puts the"
2631,CONCLUSION.,effect of this c. 29 not ill:--
2632,CONCLUSION.,
2633,CONCLUSION.,"""Although James were averse from passing the acts I have already"
2634,CONCLUSION.,"mentioned, he probably encouraged another which passed _for the"
2635,CONCLUSION.,advance and improvement of trade and for encouragement and increase
2636,CONCLUSION.,"of shipping and navigation_, which purported to throw open to"
2637,CONCLUSION.,Ireland a free and immediate trade with all our plantations and
2638,CONCLUSION.,"colonies; to promote ship-building, by remitting to the owners of"
2639,CONCLUSION.,Irish-built vessels large proportions of the duties of custom and
2640,CONCLUSION.,"excise, encourage seamen by exempting them for ten years from"
2641,CONCLUSION.,"taxes, and allowing them the freedom of any city or seaport they"
2642,CONCLUSION.,"should chuse to reside in, and improve the Irish navy by"
2643,CONCLUSION.,establishing free schools for teaching and instructing in the
2644,CONCLUSION.,"mathematics and the art of navigation, in Dublin, Belfast,"
2645,CONCLUSION.,"Waterford, Cork, Limerick, and Galway. If James looked up to any"
2646,CONCLUSION.,probability of maintaining his ground in Ireland he must have been
2647,CONCLUSION.,sensible of the necessity of an Irish navy. No man was better
2648,CONCLUSION.,qualified to judge of the utility of such institutions than this
2649,CONCLUSION.,"prince. He was an able seaman, fond of his profession; and to his"
2650,CONCLUSION.,industry and talent does the British navy owe many of its best
2651,CONCLUSION.,"signals and regulations. The firmness, resolution and enterprise"
2652,CONCLUSION.,"which had distinguished him, whilst Duke of York, as a sea officer,"
2653,CONCLUSION.,"abandoned him when king, both in the cabinet and the field."""
2654,CONCLUSION.,
2655,CONCLUSION.,"Thus, then, this Parliament exercised less severity than any of its"
2656,CONCLUSION.,time; it established liberty of conscience and equality of creeds; it
2657,CONCLUSION.,proscribed no man for his religion--the word Protestant does not occur
2658,CONCLUSION.,"in any Act--(though, while it sat, the Westminster Convention was not"
2659,CONCLUSION.,"only thundering out insults against ""popery,"" but exciting William to"
2660,CONCLUSION.,"persecute it, and laying the foundation of the penal code); it"
2661,CONCLUSION.,introduced many laws of great practical value in the business of
2662,CONCLUSION.,"society; it removed the disabilities of the natives, the scars of old"
2663,CONCLUSION.,"fetters; it was generous to the king, yet carried its own opinions out"
2664,CONCLUSION.,"against his where they differed; it, finally--and what should win the"
2665,CONCLUSION.,remembrance and veneration of Irishmen through all time--it boldly
2666,CONCLUSION.,"announced our national independence, in words which Molyneux shouted on"
2667,CONCLUSION.,"to Swift, and Swift to Lucas, and Lucas to Flood, and Flood and Grattan"
2668,CONCLUSION.,"redoubling the cry; Dungannon church rang, and Ireland was again a"
2669,CONCLUSION.,nation. Yet something it said escaped the hearing or surpassed the
2670,CONCLUSION.,"vigour of the last century; it said, ""Irish commerce fostered,"" and it"
2671,CONCLUSION.,"was faintly heard, but it said, ""an Irish navy to shield our coasts,"""
2672,CONCLUSION.,"and it said, ""an Irish army to scathe the invaders,"" and Grattan"
2673,CONCLUSION.,"neglected both, and our coast had no guardian, and our desecrated"
2674,CONCLUSION.,fields knew no avenger.
2675,CONCLUSION.,
2676,CONCLUSION.,We have printed the king's speech at the opening of this eventful
2677,CONCLUSION.,"parliament, the titles of _all_ its Acts, and all the statutes"
2678,CONCLUSION.,"summarized in full detail which we could in any way procure--sufficient,"
2679,CONCLUSION.,"we think, with the scattered notices of the chief members, to make the"
2680,CONCLUSION.,working of this Parliament plain. We are conscious of many defects in
2681,CONCLUSION.,our information and way of treating the subject; but we commenced by
2682,CONCLUSION.,avowing that we were not professors but students of Irish history;
2683,CONCLUSION.,trying to come at some clear understanding on a most important part of
2684,CONCLUSION.,"it, communicating our difficulties and offering our solutions, as they"
2685,CONCLUSION.,"occurred to us, in hopes that some of our countrymen would take up the"
2686,CONCLUSION.,"same study, and do as much or more than we have done, and possibly that"
2687,CONCLUSION.,"one of those accomplished historians, of which Ireland now has a few,"
2688,CONCLUSION.,"would take the helm from us, and guide the ship himself."
2689,CONCLUSION.,
2690,CONCLUSION.,We have no reason to suppose that we succeeded in either object; yet we
2691,CONCLUSION.,"cling to the belief that, owing to us, some few persons will for the"
2692,CONCLUSION.,future be found who will not allow the calumnies against our noble old
2693,CONCLUSION.,"Parliament of 1689 to pass uncontradicted. It might have been better,"
2694,CONCLUSION.,but this is well.
2695,CONCLUSION.,
2696,CONCLUSION.,---------------------------------------------------------------
2697,CONCLUSION.,[29] The dates about the time of this revolution are most
2698,CONCLUSION.,"important. On the 10th October, 1688, William issued an address,"
2699,CONCLUSION.,"dated at the Hague, and another from the same place, dated 24th"
2700,CONCLUSION.,"October, intended to counterwork James's retractations. He landed"
2701,CONCLUSION.,"at Torbay, November 5th, arrived in London December 17th. Some Whig"
2702,CONCLUSION.,"Lords signed an association, dated December 19th, pledging"
2703,CONCLUSION.,"themselves to stand by the prince, and avenge him if he should"
2704,CONCLUSION.,"perish. December 23rd, William issued the letter calling the"
2705,CONCLUSION.,"members of Charles II.'s parliament, the mayor, aldermen, and 50"
2706,CONCLUSION.,"councillors of London. December 26th they met, called on the prince"
2707,CONCLUSION.,"to assume the government and issue letters for a convention, and"
2708,CONCLUSION.,they signed the association of the Whig Lords. They presented their
2709,CONCLUSION.,"address 27th December, it was received December 28th, and then this"
2710,CONCLUSION.,little club broke up. December 29th William issued letters for a
2711,CONCLUSION.,"convention, which met 22nd January, 1688-9, finally agreed on their"
2712,CONCLUSION.,"declaration against James and his family, and for William and Mary,"
2713,CONCLUSION.,"12th February; and these, king and queen, were proclaimed 13th"
2714,CONCLUSION.,"February, 1688-9. February 19th, a Bill was brought in to call the"
2715,CONCLUSION.,"convention a parliament; it passed, and received royal assent 23rd"
2716,CONCLUSION.,February. By this the lords and gentlemen who met 22nd January were
2717,CONCLUSION.,"named the two houses of parliament, and the acts of this"
2718,CONCLUSION.,convention-parliament were to date from 13th February. This hybrid
2719,CONCLUSION.,"sat till 20th August, and having passed the Attainder Act was"
2720,CONCLUSION.,"adjourned to 20th September, and then 19th October, 1689. This"
2721,CONCLUSION.,"second session lasted till 27th January, 1689-90, when it was"
2722,CONCLUSION.,stopped by a prorogation to the 2nd April; but before that day it
2723,CONCLUSION.,"was dissolved, and a parliament summoned by writ, which met 20th"
2724,CONCLUSION.,"March, 1689, and as a first law, passed an act ratifying the"
2725,CONCLUSION.,proceedings of the convention.

2749,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,his power. For no man can bear to be entirely deprived of such

2751,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"is excellent, that the generality of people take delight in silly"

2756,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,
2757,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,We have been often asked by certain of the Temperance Societies to give
2758,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,them some advice on Self-Education. Lately we promised one of these
2759,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,bodies to write some hints as to how the members of it could use their
2760,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,association for their mental improvement.
2761,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,
2762,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"We said, and say again, that the Temperance Societies can be made use"
2763,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,of by the people for their instruction as well as pleasure. Assemblies
2764,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,of any kind are not the _best_ places either for study or invention.
2765,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,Home or solitude are better--home is the great teacher. In domestic
2766,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"business we learn mechanical skill, the nature of those material bodies"
2767,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,with which we have most to deal in life--we learn labour by example and
2768,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"by kindly precepts--we learn (in a prudent home) decorum, cleanliness,"
2769,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,order--in a virtuous home we learn more than these: we learn reverence
2770,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"for the old, affection without passion, truth, piety, and justice."
2771,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,These are the greatest things man can know. Having these he is well;
2772,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,without them attainments of wealth or talent are of little worth. Home
2773,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,is the great teacher; and its teaching passes down in honest homes from
2774,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"generation to generation, and neither the generation that gives, nor"
2775,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"the generation that takes it, lays down plans for bringing it to pass."
2776,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,
2777,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"Again, to come to designed learning. We learn arts and professions by"
2778,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"apprenticeships, that is, much after the fashion we learned walking, or"
2779,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"stitching, or fire-making, or love-making at home--by example, precept,"
2780,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"and practice combined. Apprentices at anything, from ditching,"
2781,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"basket-work, or watch-making, to merchant-trading, legislation, or"
2782,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"surgery, submit either to a nominal or an actual apprenticeship. They"
2783,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"see other men do these things, they desire to do the same, and they"
2784,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"learn to do so by watching _how_, and _when_, and asking, or guessing"
2785,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"_why_ each part of the business is done; and as fast as they know, or"
2786,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"are supposed to know, any one part, whether it be sloping the ditch, or"
2787,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"totting the accounts, or dressing the limb, they begin to do that, and,"
2788,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"being directed when they fail, they learn at last to do it well, and"
2789,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,are thereby prepared to attempt some other or harder part of the
2790,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,business.
2791,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,
2792,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"Thus it is by experience--or trying to do, and often doing a"
2793,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"thing--combined with teaching or seeing, and being told how and why"
2794,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"other people more experienced do that thing, that most of the practical"
2795,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,business of life is learned.
2796,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,
2797,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"In some trades, formal apprenticeship and planned teaching exist as"
2798,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,little as in ordinary home-teaching. Few men are of set purpose taught
2799,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,to dig; and just as few are taught to legislate.
2800,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,
2801,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"Where formal teaching is usual, as in what are called learned"
2802,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"professions, and in delicate trades, fewer men know anything of these"
2803,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"businesses. Those who learn them at all do so exactly and fully, but"
2804,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"commonly practise them in a formal and technical way, and invent and"
2805,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,improve them little. In those occupations which most men take up
2806,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"casually--as book-writing, digging, singing, and legislation, and the"
2807,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"like--there is much less exact knowledge, less form, more originality"
2808,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"and progress, and more of the public know something about them in an"
2809,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,unprofessional way.
2810,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,
2811,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"The Caste system of India, Egypt, and Ancient Ireland carried out the"
2812,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,formal apprenticeship plan to its full extent. The United States of
2813,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"America have very little of it. Modern Europe is between the two, as"
2814,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,she has in most things abolished caste or hereditary professions (kings
2815,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"and nobles excepted), but has, in many things, retained exact"
2816,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,apprenticeships.
2817,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,
2818,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"Marriage, and the bringing up of children, the employment of"
2819,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"dependants, travel, and daily sights and society, are our chief"
2820,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"teachers of morals, sentiment, taste, prudence and manners. Mechanical"
2821,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"and literary skill of all sorts, and most accomplishments, are usually"
2822,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,picked up in this same way.
2823,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,
2824,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,We have said all this lest our less-instructed readers should fall into
2825,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"a mistake common to all beginners in study, that books, and schooling,"
2826,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"and lectures, are the chief teachers in life; whereas most of the"
2827,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"things we learn here are learned from the experience of home, and of"
2828,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,the practical parts of our trades and amusements.
2829,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,
2830,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,We pray our humbler friends to think long and often on this.
2831,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,
2832,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,But let them not suppose we undervalue or wish them to neglect other
2833,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"kinds of teaching; on the contrary, they should mark how much the"
2834,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"influences of home, and business, and society, are affected by the"
2835,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,quantity and sort of their scholarship.
2836,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,
2837,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,Home life is obviously enough affected by education. Where the parents
2838,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"read and write, the children learn to do so too, early in life and with"
2839,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,little trouble; where they know something of their religious creed they
2840,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,give its rites a higher meaning than mere forms; where they know the
2841,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"history of the country well, every field, every old tower or arch is a"
2842,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"subject of amusement, of fine old stories, and fine young hopes; where"
2843,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"they know the nature of other people and countries, their own country"
2844,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"and people become texts to be commented on, and likewise supply a"
2845,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,living comment on those peculiarities of which they have read.
2846,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,
2847,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"Again, where the members of a family can read aloud, or play, or sing,"
2848,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,they have a well of pleasant thoughts and good feelings which can
2849,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,hardly be dried or frozen up; and so of other things.
2850,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,
2851,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"And in the trades and professions of life, to study in books the"
2852,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"objects, customs, and rules of that trade or profession to which you"
2853,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"are going saves time, enables you to improve your practice of it, and"
2854,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"makes you less dependent on the teaching of other practitioners, who"
2855,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,are often interested in delaying you.
2856,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,
2857,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"In these, and a thousand ways besides, study and science produce the"
2858,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,best effects upon the practical parts of life.
2859,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,
2860,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"Besides, the _first_ business of life is the improvement of one's"
2861,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"own heart and mind. The study of the thoughts and deeds of great men,"
2862,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"the laws of human, and animal, and vegetable, and lifeless nature, the"
2863,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"principles of fine and mechanical arts, and of morals, society, and"
2864,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"religion--all directly give us nobler and greater desires, more wide"
2865,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"and generous judgments, and more refined pleasures."
2866,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,
2867,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"Learning in this latter sense may be got either at home or at school,"
2868,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"by solitary study, or in associations. Home _learning_ depends, of"
2869,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"course, on the knowledge, good sense, and leisure of the parents. The"
2870,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"German Jean Paul, the American Emerson, and others of an inferior sort,"
2871,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,have written deep and fruitful truths on bringing up and teaching at
2872,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"home. Yet, considering its importance, it has not been sufficiently"
2873,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,studied. Upon schools much has been written. Almost all the private
2874,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,schools in this country are bad. They merely cram the memories of
2875,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"pupils with facts or words, without developing their judgment, taste,"
2876,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"or invention, or teaching them the _application_ of any knowledge."
2877,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"Besides, the things taught are commonly those least worth learning."
2878,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,This is especially true of the middle and richer classes. Instead of
2879,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"being taught the nature, products, and history, first of their own, and"
2880,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"then of other countries, they are buried in classical frivolities,"
2881,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"languages which they never master, and manners and races which they"
2882,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"cannot appreciate. Instead of being disciplined to think exactly, to"
2883,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"speak and write accurately, they are crammed with rules and taught to"
2884,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,repeat forms by rote.
2885,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,
2886,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,The National Schools are a vast improvement on anything hitherto in
2887,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"this country, but still they have great faults. From the miserably"
2888,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"small grant the teachers are badly paid, and, therefore, hastily and"
2889,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,meagrely educated.
2890,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,
2891,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"The maps, drawing, and musical instruments, museums and scientific"
2892,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"apparatus, which should be in every school, are mostly wanting"
2893,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"altogether. The books, also, are defective."
2894,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,
2895,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,The information has the worst fault of the French system: it is too
2896,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,exclusively on physical science and natural history. Fancy a _National_
2897,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,School which teaches the children no more of the state and history of
2898,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"Ireland than of Belgium or Japan! We have spoken to pupils, nay, to"
2899,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"masters of the _National_ Schools, who were ignorant of the physical"
2900,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,character of every part of Ireland except their native villages--who
2901,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"knew not how the people lived, or died, or sported, or fought--who had"
2902,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"never heard of Tara, Clontarf, Limerick, or Dungannon--to whom the"
2903,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"O'Neills and Sarsfields, the Swifts and Sternes, the Grattans and"
2904,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"Barrys, our generals, statesmen, authors, orators, and artists, were"
2905,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,alike and utterly unknown! Even the hedge schools kept up something of
2906,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"the romance, history, and music of the country."
2907,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,
2908,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"Until the _National_ Schools fall under national control, the people"
2909,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"must take _diligent care to procure books on the history, men,"
2910,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"language, music, and manners of Ireland for their children_. These"
2911,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"schools are very good so far as they go, and the children should be"
2912,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"sent to them; but they are not _national_, they do not use the Irish"
2913,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"language, nor teach anything peculiarly Irish."
2914,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,
2915,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"As to solitary study, lists of books, pictures, and maps can alone be"
2916,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,given; and to do this usefully would exceed our space at present.
2917,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,
2918,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"As it is, we find that we have no more room and have not said a word on"
2919,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"what we proposed to write--namely, Self-Education through the"
2920,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,Temperance Societies.
2921,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,
2922,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,"We do not regret having wandered from our professed subject, as, if"

2924,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,afterthought could cure.
2925,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,
2926,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,What we chiefly desire is to set the people on making out plans for
2927,MEANS AND AIDS TO SELF-EDUCATION.,their own and their children's education. Thinking cannot be done by

2961,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
2962,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,If we attempt to govern ourselves without statesmanship--to be a nation
2963,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"without a knowledge of the country's history, and of the propensities"
2964,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"to good and ill of the people--or to fight without generalship, we will"
2965,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"fail in policy, society, and war. These--all these things--we, people"
2966,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"of Ireland, must know if we would be a free, strong nation. A mockery"
2967,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,of Irish independence is not what we want. The bauble of a powerless
2968,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,parliament does not lure us. We are not children. The office of
2969,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"supplying England with recruits, artizans, and corn, under the benign"
2970,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"interpositions of an Irish Grand Jury, _shall_ not be our destiny. By"

2973,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"We are true to our colour, ""the green,"" and true to our watchword,"

2977,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"it, the men of Ireland must know what it is, what it was, and what it"
2978,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"can be made. They must study her history, perfectly know her present"
2979,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"state, physical and moral--and train themselves up by science, poetry,"
2980,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"music, industry, skill, and by all the studies and accomplishments of"

2982,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
2983,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"If Ireland were in national health, her history would be familiar by"

2992,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Academies of art, institutes of science, colleges of literature,"

2995,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"please God, we shall have them all. Till then we must work for"
2996,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"ourselves. So far as we can study music in societies, art in schools,"
2997,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"literature in institutes, science in our colleges, or soldiership in"

3000,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,must try and study for ourselves. We must visit museums and

3002,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"what the country and people were, how they fell, how they suffered, and"

3011,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"To resume, we must read such statistics as we have, and try and get"
3012,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,better; and we must get the best maps of the country--the Ordnance and
3013,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"County Index Maps, price 2_s._ 6_d._ each, and the Railway Map, price"
3014,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"£1--into our Mechanics' Institutes, Temperance Reading-rooms, and"
3015,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"schools. We must, in making our journeys of business and pleasure,"
3016,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"observe and ask for the nature and amount of the agriculture, commerce,"
3017,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"and manufactures of the place we are in, and its shape, population,"
3018,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"scenery, antiquities, arts, music, dress, and capabilities for"
3019,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,improvement. A large portion of our people travel a great deal within
3020,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Ireland, and often return with no knowledge, save of the inns they"
3021,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,slept in and the traders they dealt with.
3022,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
3023,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"We must give our children in schools the best knowledge of science,"
3024,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"art, and literary elements possible. And at home they should see and"
3025,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"hear as much of national pictures, music, poetry, and military science"
3026,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,as possible.
3027,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
3028,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"And finally, we must keep our own souls, and try, by teaching and"
3029,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"example, to lift up the souls of all our family and neighbours to that"
3030,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"pitch of industry, courage, information, and wisdom necessary to enable"
3031,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"an enslaved, dark, and starving people to become free, and rich, and"
3032,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,rational.
3033,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
3034,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Well, as to this National History--L'Abbé MacGeoghegan published a"
3035,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"history of Ireland, in French, in 3 volumes, quarto, dedicated to the"
3036,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,Irish Brigade. Writing in France he was free from the English
3037,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"censorship; writing for ""The Brigade,"" he avoided the impudence of"
3038,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Huguenot historians. The sneers of the Deist Voltaire, and the lies of"
3039,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"the Catholic Cambrensis, receive a sharp chastisement in his preface,"
3040,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,and a full answer in his text. He was a man of the most varied
3041,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,acquirements and an elegant writer. More full references and the
3042,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,correction of a few errors of detail would render his book more
3043,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"satisfactory to the professor of history, but for the student it is the"
3044,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"best in the world. He is graphic, easy, and Irish. He is not a bigot,"
3045,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,but apparently a genuine Catholic. His information as to the numbers of
3046,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"troops, and other facts of our Irish battles, is superior to any other"
3047,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"general historian's; and they who know it well need not blush, as most"
3048,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Irishmen must now, at their ignorance of Irish history."
3049,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
3050,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,But the Association for liberating Ireland has offered a prize for a
3051,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"new history of the country, and given ample time for preparation."
3052,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
3053,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,Let no man postpone the preparation who hopes the prize. An original
3054,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"and highly-finished work is what is demanded, and for the composition"
3055,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,of such a work the time affords no leisure.
3056,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
3057,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Few persons, we suppose, hitherto quite ignorant of Irish history, will"
3058,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,compete; but we would not discourage even these. There is neither in
3059,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,theory nor fact any limit to the possible achievements of genius and
3060,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"energy. Some of the greatest works in existence were written rapidly,"
3061,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,and many an old book-worm fails where a young book-thrasher succeeds.
3062,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
3063,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,Let us now consider some of the qualities which should belong to this
3064,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,history.
3065,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
3066,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"_It should, in the first place, be written from the original"
3067,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,authorities._ We have some notion of giving a set of papers on these
3068,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"authorities, but there are reasons against such a course, and we"
3069,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"counsel no man to rely on us--every one on himself; besides, such a"
3070,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,historian should rather make himself able to teach us than need to
3071,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,learn from us.
3072,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
3073,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"However, no one can now be at a loss to know what these authorities"
3074,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,are. A list of the choicest of them is printed on the back of the
3075,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Volunteer's card for this year, and was also printed in the"
3076,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,_Nation_.[30] These authorities are not enough for a historian. The
3077,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"materials, since the Revolution especially, exist mainly in pamphlets,"
3078,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,and even for the time previous only the leading authorities are in the
3079,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"list. The list is not faulty in this, as it was meant for learners, not"
3080,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,teachers; but anyone using these authorities will readily learn from
3081,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"them what the others are, and can so track out for himself."
3082,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
3083,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"There are, however, three tracts specially on the subject of Irish"
3084,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"writers. First is Bishop Nicholson's ""Irish Historical Library."" It"
3085,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"gives accounts of numerous writers, but is wretchedly meagre. In"
3086,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Harris's ""Hibernica"" is a short tract on the same subject; and in"
3087,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,Harris's edition of Ware's works an ample treatise on _Irish Writers_.
3088,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"This treatise is most valuable, but must be read with caution, as Ware"
3089,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"was slightly, and Harris enormously, prejudiced against the native"
3090,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Irish and against the later Catholic writers. The criticisms of Harris,"
3091,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"indeed, on all books relative to the Religious Wars are partial and"
3092,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,deceptious; but we repeat that the work is of great value.
3093,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
3094,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,The only more recent work on the subject is a volume written by Edward
3095,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"O'Reilly, for the Iberno-Celtic Society, on the Native Irish Poets: an"
3096,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"interesting work, and containing morsels invaluable to a picturesque"
3097,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,historian.
3098,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
3099,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"By the way, we may hope that the studies for this prize history will be"
3100,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,fruitful for historical ballads.
3101,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
3102,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,Too many of the original works can only be bought at an expense beyond
3103,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"the means of most of those likely to compete. For instance, Harris's"
3104,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"""Ware,"" ""Fynes Moryson,"" and ""The State Papers of Henry the Eighth,"""
3105,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,are very dear. The works of the Archæological Society can only be got
3106,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"by a member. The price of O'Connor's ""Rerum Hibernicarum Scriptores"
3107,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Veteres"" is eighteen guineas; and yet, in it alone the annals of"
3108,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Tigernach, Boyle, Innisfallen, and the early part of the ""Four Masters"""
3109,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"are to be found. The great majority of the books, however, are"
3110,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,tolerably cheap; some of the dearer books might be got by combination
3111,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"among several persons, and afterwards given to the Repeal"
3112,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,Reading-rooms.
3113,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
3114,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"However, persons resident in, or able to visit Dublin, Cork, or"
3115,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Belfast, can study all, even the scarcest of these works, without any"
3116,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,real difficulty.
3117,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
3118,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"As to the qualities of such a history, they have been concisely enough"
3119,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,intimated by the Committee.
3120,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
3121,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,It is to be A HISTORY. One of the most absurd pieces of cant going is
3122,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"that against history, because it is full of wars, and kings, and"
3123,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"usurpers, and mobs. History describes, and is meant to describe,"
3124,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"_forces_, not proprieties--the mights, the acted realities of men, bad"
3125,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"and good--their historical importance depending on their mightiness,"
3126,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"not their holiness. Let us by all means have, then, a ""graphic"""
3127,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"narrative of what was, not a set of moral disquisitions on what ought"
3128,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,to have been.
3129,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
3130,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,Yet the man who would keep chronicling the dry events would miss
3131,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,writing a history. He must fathom the social condition of the
3132,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"peasantry, the townsmen, the middle-classes, the nobles, and the clergy"
3133,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"(Christian or Pagan), in each period--how they fed, dressed, armed, and"
3134,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"housed themselves. He must exhibit the nature of the government, the"
3135,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"manners, the administration of law, the state of useful and fine arts,"
3136,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"of commerce, of foreign relations. He must let us see the decay and"
3137,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,rise of great principles and conditions--till we look on a tottering
3138,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"sovereignty, a rising creed, an incipient war, as distinctly as, by"
3139,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"turning to the highway, we can see the old man, the vigorous youth, or"
3140,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,the infant child. He must paint--the council robed in its hall--the
3141,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,priest in his temple--the conspirator--the outlaw--the judge--the
3142,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"general--the martyr. The arms must clash and shine with genuine, not"
3143,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"romantic, likeness; and the brigades or clans join battle, or divide in"
3144,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"flight, before the reader's thought. Above all, a historian should be"
3145,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"able to seize on character, not vaguely eulogising nor cursing; but"
3146,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"feeling and expressing the pressure of a great mind on his time, and on"
3147,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,after-times.
3148,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
3149,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Such things may be done partly in disquisitions, as in Michelet's"
3150,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"""France""; but they must now be done in narrative; and nowhere, not even"
3151,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"in Livy, is there a finer specimen of how all these things may be done"
3152,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"by narrative than in Augustine Thierry's ""Norman Conquest"" and"
3153,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"""Merovingian Scenes."" The only danger to be avoided in dealing with so"
3154,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,long a period in Thierry's way is the continuing to attach importance
3155,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"to a once great influence, when it has sunk to be an exceptive power."
3156,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,He who thinks it possible to dash off a profoundly coloured and shaded
3157,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,narrative like this of Thierry's will find himself bitterly wrong. Even
3158,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,a great philosophical view may much more easily be extemporised than
3159,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,this lasting and finished image of past times.
3160,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
3161,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,The greatest vice in such a work would be bigotry--bigotry of race or
3162,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,creed. We know a descendant of a great Milesian family who supports the
3163,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Union, because he thinks the descendants of the Anglo-Irish--his"
3164,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"ancestors' foes--would mainly rule Ireland, were she independent. The"
3165,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,opposite rage against the older races is still more usual. A religious
3166,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"bigot is altogether unfit, incurably unfit, for such a task; and the"
3167,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"writer of such an Irish history must feel a love for all sects, a"
3168,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"philosophical eye to the merits and demerits of all, and a solemn and"
3169,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,haughty impartiality in speaking of all.
3170,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
3171,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Need we say that a history, wherein glowing oratory appeared in place"
3172,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"of historical painting, bold assertion instead of justified"
3173,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"portraiture, flattery to the living instead of justice to the dead,"
3174,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"clever plunder of other compilers instead of original research, or a"
3175,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"cramped and scholastic instead of an idiomatic, ""clear and graphic"""
3176,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"style, would deserve rejection, and would, we cannot doubt, obtain it."
3177,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
3178,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,To give such a history to Ireland as is now sought will be a proud and
3179,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"illustrious deed. Such a work would have no passing influence, though"
3180,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,its first political effect would be enormous; it would be read by every
3181,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,class and side; for there is no readable book on the subject; it would
3182,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"people our streets, and glens, and castles, and abbeys, and coasts with"
3183,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,a hundred generations besides our own; it would clear up the grounds of
3184,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"our quarrels, and prepare reconciliation; it would _unconsciously_"
3185,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,make us recognise the causes of our weakness; it would give us great
3186,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"examples of men and of events, and materially influence our destiny."
3187,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
3188,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Shall we get such a history? Think, reader! has God given you the soul"
3189,THE HISTORY OF IRELAND.,and perseverance to create this marvel?

3261,ANCIENT IRELAND.,
3262,ANCIENT IRELAND.,
3263,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"There was once civilisation in Ireland. We never were very eminent, to"
3264,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"be sure, for manufactures in metal, our houses were simple, our very"
3265,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"palaces rude, our furniture scanty, our saffron shirts not often"
3266,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"changed, and our foreign trade small. Yet was Ireland civilised."
3267,ANCIENT IRELAND.,Strange thing! says someone whose ideas of civilisation are identical
3268,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"with carpets and cut-glass, fine masonry, and the steam engine; yet"
3269,ANCIENT IRELAND.,'tis true. For there was a time when learning was endowed by the rich
3270,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"and honoured by the poor, and taught all over our country. Not only did"
3271,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"thousands of natives frequent our schools and colleges, but men of"
3272,ANCIENT IRELAND.,every rank came here from the Continent to study under the professors
3273,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"and system of Ireland, and we need not go beyond the testimonies of"
3274,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"English antiquaries, from Bede to Camden, that these schools were"
3275,ANCIENT IRELAND.,regarded as the first in Europe. Ireland was equally remarkable for
3276,ANCIENT IRELAND.,piety. In the Pagan times it was regarded as a sanctuary of the Magian
3277,ANCIENT IRELAND.,or Druid creed. From the fifth century it became equally illustrious in
3278,ANCIENT IRELAND.,Christendom. Without going into the disputed question of whether the
3279,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"Irish church was or was not independent of Rome, it is certain that"
3280,ANCIENT IRELAND.,Italy did not send out more apostles from the fifth to the ninth
3281,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"centuries than Ireland, and we find their names and achievements"
3282,ANCIENT IRELAND.,remembered through the Continent.
3283,ANCIENT IRELAND.,
3284,ANCIENT IRELAND.,Of two names which Hallam thinks worth rescuing from the darkness of
3285,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"the dark ages, one is the Irish metaphysician, John Erigena. In a"
3286,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"recent communication to the ""Association"" we had Bavarians"
3287,ANCIENT IRELAND.,acknowledging the Irish St. Killian as the apostle of their country.
3288,ANCIENT IRELAND.,
3289,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"Yet what, beyond a catalogue of names and a few marked events, do even"
3290,ANCIENT IRELAND.,the educated Irish know of the heroic pagans or the holy Christians of
3291,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"Old Ireland? These men have left libraries of biography, religion,"
3292,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"philosophy, natural history, topography, history, and romance. They"
3293,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"_cannot all be worthless_; yet, except the few volumes given us by"
3294,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"the Archæological Society, which of their works have any of us read?"
3295,ANCIENT IRELAND.,
3296,ANCIENT IRELAND.,It is also certain that we possessed written laws with extensive and
3297,ANCIENT IRELAND.,minute comments and reported decisions. These Brehon laws have been
3298,ANCIENT IRELAND.,foully misrepresented by Sir John Davies. Their tenures were the
3299,ANCIENT IRELAND.,gavelkind once prevalent over most of the world. The land belonged to
3300,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"the clan, and on the death of a clansman his share was re-apportioned"
3301,ANCIENT IRELAND.,according to the number and wants of his family. The system of erics or
3302,ANCIENT IRELAND.,fines for offences has existed amongst every people from the Hebrews
3303,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"downwards, nor can anyone, knowing the multitude of crimes now"
3304,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"punishable by fines or damages, think the people of this empire"
3305,ANCIENT IRELAND.,justified in calling the ancient Irish barbarous because they extended
3306,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"the system. There is in these laws, so far as they are known,"
3307,ANCIENT IRELAND.,minuteness and equity; and what is a better test of their goodness we
3308,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"learn from Sir John Davies himself, and from the still abler Baron"
3309,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"Finglass, that the people reverenced, obeyed, and clung to these laws,"
3310,ANCIENT IRELAND.,though to decide by or obey them was a high crime by England's code.
3311,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"Moreover, the Norman and Saxon settlers hastened to adopt these Irish"
3312,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"laws, and used them more resolutely, if possible, than the Irish"
3313,ANCIENT IRELAND.,themselves.
3314,ANCIENT IRELAND.,
3315,ANCIENT IRELAND.,Orderliness and hospitality were peculiarly cultivated. Public
3316,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"caravansarais were built for travellers in every district, and we have"
3317,ANCIENT IRELAND.,what would almost be legal evidence of the grant of vast tracts of land
3318,ANCIENT IRELAND.,for the supply of provisions for these houses of hospitality. The
3319,ANCIENT IRELAND.,private hospitality of the chiefs was equally marked; nor was it quite
3320,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"rude. Ceremony was united with great freedom of intercourse, age, and"
3321,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"learning, and rank, and virtue were respected, and these men, whose"
3322,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"cookery was probably as coarse as that of Homer's heroes, had around"
3323,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"their board harpers and bards who sang poetry as gallant and fiery,"
3324,ANCIENT IRELAND.,"though not so grand, as the Homeric ballad-singers, and flung off a"
3325,ANCIENT IRELAND.,music which Greece never rivalled.
3326,ANCIENT IRELAND.,

3391,HISTORICAL MONUMENTS OF IRELAND.,justice was administered here? Do not you meet the Druid's altar and

3473,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,History is too young to have noted its origin--Archæology knows not its
3474,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"time. It is a legacy from a forgotten ancestor, to prove that he, too,"
3475,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"had art and religion. It may have marked the tomb of a hero who freed,"
3476,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,or an invader who subdued--a Brian or a Strongbow. But whether or not a
3477,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"hero's or a saint's bones consecrated it at first, this is plain--it is"

3481,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"It is a thing to be proud of, as a proof of Ireland's antiquity, to be"

3509,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"shielding her monuments from the iron clutch of time, than all the"
3510,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,roads in Leinster cost. It is only on time she needs to keep watch. A
3511,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,French peasant would blush to meet his neighbour had he levelled a
3512,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"Gaulish tomb, crammed the fair moulding of an abbey into his wall, or"
3513,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"sold to a crucible the coins which tell that a Julius, a Charlemagne,"
3514,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,or a Philip Augustus swayed his native land. And so it is everywhere.
3515,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"Republican Switzerland, despotic Austria, Prussia and Norway, Bavaria"

3517,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"architecture, sculpture, rites, dress, or manners of their"
3518,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"ancestors--nay, each little commune would guard with arms these local"

3530,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"Clontarf, our history grows ennobled (like that of a decayed house),"
3531,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,and we see Lismore and Armagh centres of European learning; we see our
3532,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"missionaries seizing and taming the conquerors of Europe, and, farther"
3533,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"still, rises the wizard pomp of Eman and Tara--the palace of the Irish"
3534,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,Pentarchy. And are we the people to whom the English (whose fathers
3535,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,were painted savages when Tyre and Sidon traded with this land) can
3536,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,address reproaches for our rudeness and irreverence? So it seems. The
3537,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,_Athenæum_ says:--
3538,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,
3539,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"""It is much to be regretted that the society lately established in"
3540,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"England, having for its object the preservation of British"
3541,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"antiquities, did not extend its design over those of the sister"
3542,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"island, which are daily becoming fewer and fewer in number. That"
3543,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,the gold ornaments which are so frequently found in various parts
3544,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,of Ireland should be melted down for the sake of the very pure gold
3545,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"of which they are composed, is scarcely surprising; but that carved"
3546,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"stones and even immense druidical remains should be destroyed is,"
3547,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"indeed, greatly to be lamented. At one of the late meetings of the"
3548,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,Royal Irish Academy a communication was made of the intention of
3549,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,the proprietor of the estate at New Grange to destroy that most
3550,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"gigantic relic of druidical times, which has justly been termed the"
3551,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"Irish pyramid, merely because its vast size 'cumbereth the ground.'"
3552,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,At Mellifont a modern cornmill of large size has been built out of
3553,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"the stones of the beautiful monastic buildings, some of which still"
3554,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"adorn that charming spot. At Monasterboice, the churchyard of which"
3555,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"contains one of the finest of the round towers, are the ruins of"
3556,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"two of the little ancient stone Irish churches, and three most"
3557,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"elaborately carved stone crosses, eighteen or twenty feet high. The"
3558,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"churchyard itself is overrun with weeds, the sanctity of the place"
3559,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"being its only safeguard. At Clonmacnoise, where, some forty years"
3560,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"ago, several hundred inscriptions in the ancient Irish character"
3561,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"were to be seen upon the gravestones, scarcely a dozen (and they"
3562,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,the least interesting) are now to be found--the large flat stones
3563,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"on which they were carved forming excellent slabs for doorways, the"
3564,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"copings of walls, etc.! It was the discovery of some of these"
3565,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,carved stones in such a situation which had the effect of directing
3566,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,the attention of Mr. Petrie (then an artist in search of the
3567,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"picturesque, but now one of the most enlightened and conscientious"
3568,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,of the Irish antiquaries) to the study of antiquities; and it is
3569,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,upon the careful series of drawings made by him that future
3570,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,antiquarians must rely for very much of ancient architectural
3571,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"detail now destroyed. As to Glendalough, it is so much a holiday"
3572,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,place for the Dubliners that it is no wonder everything portable
3573,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,has disappeared. Two or three of the seven churches are levelled to
3574,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"the ground--all the characteristic carvings described by Ledwich,"
3575,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"and which were '_quite unique in Ireland_,' are gone. Some were"
3576,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,removed and used as keystones for the arches of Derrybawn bridge.
3577,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"Part of the churchyard has been cleared of its gravestones, and"
3578,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"forms a famous place, where the villagers play at ball against the"
3579,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"old walls of the church. The little church, called 'St. Kevin's"
3580,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"Kitchen,' is given up to the sheep, and the font lies in one"
3581,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"corner, and is used for the vilest purposes. The abbey church is"
3582,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"choked up with trees and brambles, and being a little out of the"
3583,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"way a very few of the carved stones still remain there, two of the"
3584,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,most interesting of which I found used as coping-stones to the wall
3585,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,which surrounds it. The connection between the ancient churches of
3586,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,Ireland and the North of England renders the preservation of the
3587,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,Irish antiquities especially interesting to the English
3588,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,antiquarian; and it is with the hope of drawing attention to the
3589,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,destruction of those ancient Irish monuments that I have written
3590,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"these few lines. The Irish themselves are, unfortunately, so"
3591,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"engrossed with political and religious controversies, that it can"
3592,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,scarcely be hoped that single-handed they will be roused to the
3593,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,rescue even of these evidences of their former national greatness.
3594,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"Besides, a great obstacle exists against any interference with the"
3595,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"religious antiquities of the country, from the strong feelings"
3596,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"entertained by the people on the subject, although _practically_,"
3597,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"as we have seen, of so little weight. Let us hope that the public"
3598,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,attention directed to these objects will have a beneficial result
3599,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,and ensure a greater share of 'justice to Ireland'; for will it be
3600,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,believed that the only establishment in Ireland for the propagation
3601,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,and diffusion of scientific and antiquarian knowledge--the Royal
3602,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,Irish Academy--receives annually the munificent sum of £300 from
3603,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"the Government! And yet, notwithstanding this pittance, the members"
3604,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,of that society have made a step in the right direction by the
3605,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,purchase of the late Dean of St. Patrick's Irish Archæological
3606,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"Collection, of which a fine series of drawings is now being made at"
3607,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"the expense of the Academy, and of which they would, doubtless,"
3608,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"allow copies to be made, so as to obtain a return of a portion of"
3609,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"the expense to which they are now subjected. Small, moreover, as"
3610,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"the collection is, it forms a striking contrast with our own"
3611,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"_National_ Museum, which, rich in foreign antiquities, is almost"
3612,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"without a single object of native archæological interest, if we"
3613,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"except the series of English and Anglo-Saxon coins and MSS."""
3614,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,
3615,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,The Catholic clergy were long and naturally the guardians of our
3616,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"antiquities, and many of their archæological works testify their"
3617,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"prodigious learning. Of late, too, the honourable and wise reverence"
3618,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"brought back to England has reached the Irish Protestant clergy, and"
3619,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"they no longer make antiquity a reproach, or make the maxims of the"
3620,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,iconoclast part of their creed.
3621,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,
3622,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"Is it extravagant to speculate on the possibility of the Episcopalian,"
3623,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"Catholic, and Presbyterian clergy joining in an Antiquarian Society to"
3624,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"preserve our ecclesiastical remains--our churches, our abbeys, our"
3625,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"crosses, and our fathers' tombs, from fellows like the Meath"
3626,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"road-makers? It would be a politic and a noble emulation of the sects,"

3628,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,to pray in. There's hardly a barony wherein we could not find an old
3629,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"parish or abbey church, capable of being restored to its former beauty"
3630,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"and convenience at a less expense than some beastly barn is run up, as"
3631,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"if to prove and confirm the fact that we have little art, learning, or"
3632,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,imagination.
3633,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,
3634,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,Nor do we see why some of these hundreds of half-spoiled buildings
3635,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"might not be used for civil purposes--as almshouses, schools,"
3636,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"lecture-rooms, town-halls. It would always add another grace to an"
3637,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,institution to have its home venerable with age and restored to beauty.
3638,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,We have seen men of all creeds join the Archæological Society to
3639,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"preserve and revive our ancient literature. Why may we not see, even"
3640,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"without waiting for the aid of an Irish Parliament, an Antiquarian"
3641,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"Society, equally embracing the chief civilians and divines, and"
3642,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,charging itself with the duties performed in France by the Commission
3643,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,of Antiquities and Monuments?
3644,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,
3645,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,The Irish antiquarians of the last century did much good. They called
3646,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,attention to the history and manners of our predecessors which we had
3647,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"forgotten. They gave a pedigree to nationhood, and created a faith that"
3648,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,Ireland could and should be great again by magnifying what she had
3649,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"been. They excited the noblest passions--veneration, love of glory,"
3650,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"beauty, and virtue. They awoke men's fancy by their gorgeous pictures"
3651,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"of the past, and imagination strove to surpass them by its creations."
3652,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"They believed what they wrote, and thus their wildest stories sank into"
3653,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"men's minds. To the exertions of Walker, O'Halloran, Vallancey, and a"
3654,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"few other Irish academicians in the last century, we owe almost all the"
3655,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,Irish knowledge possessed by our upper classes till very lately. It was
3656,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"small, but it was enough to give a dreamy renown to ancient Ireland;"
3657,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"and if it did nothing else, it smoothed the reception of Bunting's"
3658,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"music, and identified Moore's poetry with his native country."
3659,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,
3660,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"While, therefore, we at once concede that Vallancey was a bad scholar,"
3661,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"O'Halloran a credulous historian, and Walker a shallow antiquarian, we"
3662,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"claim for them gratitude and attachment, and protest, once for all,"
3663,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,against the indiscriminate abuse of them now going in our educated
3664,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,circles.
3665,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,
3666,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,But no one should lie down under the belief that these were the deep
3667,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,and exact men their contemporaries thought them. They were not patient
3668,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"nor laborious. They were very graceful, very fanciful, and often very"
3669,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,wrong in their statements and their guesses. How often they avoided
3670,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,painful research by gay guessing we are only now learning. O'Halloran
3671,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,and Keatinge have told us bardic romances with the same tone as true
3672,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"chronicles. Vallancey twisted language, towers, and traditions into his"
3673,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,wicker-work theory of Pagan Ireland; and Walker built great facts and
3674,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"great blunders, granite blocks and rotten wood, into his antiquarian"
3675,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"edifices. One of the commonest errors, attributing immense antiquity,"
3676,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"oriental origin, and everything noble in Ireland to the Milesians,"
3677,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"originated with these men; or, rather, was transferred from the"
3678,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"adulatory songs of clan-bards to grave stories. Now, it is quite"
3679,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"certain that several races flourished here before the Milesians, and"
3680,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"that everything oriental, and much that was famous in Ireland, belonged"
3681,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"to some of these elder races, and not to the Scoti or Milesians."
3682,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,
3683,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,Premising this much of warning and defence as to the men who first made
3684,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,anything of ancient Ireland known to the mixed nation of modern
3685,IRISH ANTIQUITIES.,"Ireland, we turn with pure pleasure to their successors, the"

3864,FIRE TEMPLES.,FIRE TEMPLES.
3865,FIRE TEMPLES.,
3866,FIRE TEMPLES.,Vallancey's first analogy is plausible. The Irish Druids honoured the
3867,FIRE TEMPLES.,"elements and kept up sacred fires, and at a particular day in the year"
3868,FIRE TEMPLES.,"all the fires in the kingdom were put out, and had to be re-lighted"
3869,FIRE TEMPLES.,from the Arch-Druid's fire. A similar creed and custom existed among
3870,FIRE TEMPLES.,"the Parsees or Guebres of Persia, and he takes the resemblance to prove"
3871,FIRE TEMPLES.,connection and identity of creed and civilisation. From this he
3872,FIRE TEMPLES.,immediately concludes the Round Towers to be Fire Temples. Now there is
3873,FIRE TEMPLES.,"no evidence that the Irish Pagans had sacred fires, except in open"
3874,FIRE TEMPLES.,"spaces (on the hilltops), and, therefore, none of course that they had"
3875,FIRE TEMPLES.,them in towers round or square; but Vallancey falls back on the
3876,FIRE TEMPLES.,"_alleged existence of Round Towers in the East similar to ours, and"
3877,FIRE TEMPLES.,on etymology_.
3878,FIRE TEMPLES.,
3879,FIRE TEMPLES.,Here is a specimen of his etymologies. The Hebrew word _gadul_
3880,FIRE TEMPLES.,"signifies _great_, and thence a tower; the Irish name for a round"
3881,FIRE TEMPLES.,"tower, _cloghad_, is from this _gadul_ or _gad_, and _clogh_, a"
3882,FIRE TEMPLES.,_stone_: and the Druids called every place of worship _cloghad_. To
3883,FIRE TEMPLES.,"which it is answered--_gadul_ is not _gad_--_clogh_, a _stone_, is not"
3884,FIRE TEMPLES.,"_cloch_, a _bell_. The Irish word for a Round Tower is _cloich-theach_,"
3885,FIRE TEMPLES.,"or bell-house, and there is no proof that the Druids called _any_ place"
3886,FIRE TEMPLES.,of worship _cloghad_.
3887,FIRE TEMPLES.,
3888,FIRE TEMPLES.,"Vallancey's guesses are numerous, and nearly all childish, and we shall"
3889,FIRE TEMPLES.,"quote some finishing specimens, with Mr. Petrie's answers:--"
3890,FIRE TEMPLES.,
3891,FIRE TEMPLES.,"""This is another characteristic example of Vallancey's mode of"
3892,FIRE TEMPLES.,quoting authorities: he first makes O'Brien say that _Cuilceach_
3893,FIRE TEMPLES.,"becomes corruptly _Claiceach_, and then that the word _seems_ to be"
3894,FIRE TEMPLES.,corrupted _Clogtheach_. But O'Brien does not say that _Cuilceach_
3895,FIRE TEMPLES.,"is corruptly _Claiceach_, nor has he the word _Culkak_ or"
3896,FIRE TEMPLES.,_Claiceach_ in his book; neither does he say that _Cuilceach seems_
3897,FIRE TEMPLES.,"to be a corruption of _Clog-theach_, but states positively that it"
3898,FIRE TEMPLES.,is so. The following are the passages which Vallancey has so
3899,FIRE TEMPLES.,misquoted and garbled--
3900,FIRE TEMPLES.,
3901,FIRE TEMPLES.,"""'CUILCEACH, a steeple, cuilceach Cluan-umba, Cloyne steeple--this"
3902,FIRE TEMPLES.,word _is_ a corruption of Clog-theach.
3903,FIRE TEMPLES.,
3904,FIRE TEMPLES.,"""'CLOIG-THEACH, a steeple, a belfry; _corrupte_ Cuilg-theach.'"
3905,FIRE TEMPLES.,
3906,FIRE TEMPLES.,"""Our author next tells us that another name for the Round Towers is"
3907,FIRE TEMPLES.,"_Sibheit_, _Sithbeit_, and _Sithbein_, and for this he refers us to"
3908,FIRE TEMPLES.,O'Brien's and Shaw's Lexicons; but this quotation is equally false
3909,FIRE TEMPLES.,"with those I have already exposed, for the words _Sibheit_ and"
3910,FIRE TEMPLES.,_Sithbeit_ are not to be found in either of the works referred to.
3911,FIRE TEMPLES.,"The word _Sithbhe_ is indeed given in both Lexicons, but explained"
3912,FIRE TEMPLES.,"a city, not a round tower. The word _Sithbhein_ is also given in"
3913,FIRE TEMPLES.,"both, but explained a fort, a turret, and the real meaning of the"
3914,FIRE TEMPLES.,"word as still understood in many parts of Ireland is a fairy-hill,"
3915,FIRE TEMPLES.,"or hill of the fairies, and is applied to a green round hill"

3938,FIRE TEMPLES.,
3939,FIRE TEMPLES.,"The next person disposed of is Mr. Beauford, who derives the name of"
3940,FIRE TEMPLES.,our Round Towers from _Tlacht--earth_; asserts that the foundations of

3945,FIRE TEMPLES.,Druidism--and that the present towers were built in imitation of the
3946,FIRE TEMPLES.,"Magian Towers. This is all, as Mr. Petrie says, pure fallacy, without a"
3947,FIRE TEMPLES.,"particle of authority; but we should think ""_twelfth_"" is a misprint"
3948,FIRE TEMPLES.,"for ""_seventh_"" in the early part of Beauford's passage, and,"
3949,FIRE TEMPLES.,"therefore, that the last clause of Mr. Petrie's censure is undeserved."
3950,FIRE TEMPLES.,
3951,FIRE TEMPLES.,"This Beauford is not to be confounded with Miss Beaufort. She, too,"
3952,FIRE TEMPLES.,paganises the towers by aggravating some misstatements of Mason's

4039,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,"Dr. Charles O'Connor, of Stowe, is the chief supporter of the"

4041,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,"reading of the word ""_turaghun_"" (which he derives from _tur_, a tower,"
4042,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,"and _aghan_, or _adhan_, the kindling of flame), instead of"
4043,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,"""_truaghan_,"" an ascetic. The only other authority of his which we have"

4045,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,which it is said that certain Fidhnemead were burned by lightning at
4046,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,"Armagh. He translates the word celestial indexes, and paraphrases it"
4047,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,"Round Towers, and all because _fiadh_ means witness, and _neimhedh_,"
4048,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,"heavenly or sacred, the real meaning being holy wood, or wood of the"
4049,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,"sanctuary, from _fidh_, a wood, and _neimhedh_, holy, as is proved by a"

4052,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,"Dr. Lanigan, in his ecclesiastical history, and Moore, in his general"

4055,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,but it is plain that nothing prevailed more with them than the alleged
4056,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,resemblance of these towers to certain oriental buildings. Assuredly if
4057,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,there were a close likeness between the Irish Round Towers and oriental
4058,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,"fire temples of proved antiquity, it would be an argument for identity"
4059,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,of use; and though direct testimony from our annals would come in and
4060,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,show that the present towers were built as Christian belfries from the
4061,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,"sixth to the tenth centuries, the resemblance would at least indicate"
4062,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,that the belfries had been built after the model of Pagan fire towers
4063,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,"previously existing here. But ""rotundos of above thirty feet in"
4064,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,"diameter"" in Persia, Turkish minarets of the tenth or fourteenth"
4065,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,"centuries, and undated turrets in India, which Lord Valentia thought"
4066,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,"like our Round Towers, give no _such_ resemblance. We shall look"
4067,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,anxiously for exact measurements and datas of oriental buildings
4068,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,"resembling Round Towers, and weigh the evidence which may be offered to"

4075,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,"temples formed in that island, and attributed to the Phoenicians. But,"
4076,CELESTIAL INDEXES.,"alas, for the theory, they have turned out to be ""as broad as they're"

4156,HISTORY OF THE CEMETERIES.,"Gailian (_i.e._, the province of Leinster), and the province of"

4164,HISTORY OF THE CEMETERIES.,"Eochaidh fit to receive it but herself, for Lughaidh was not fit"

4262,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"When valour becomes a reproach, when patriotism is thought a prejudice,"
4263,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"and when a soldier's sword is a sign of shame, the Irish Brigade will"
4264,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,be forgotten or despised.
4265,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,
4266,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"The Irish are a military people--strong, nimble, and hardy, fond of"
4267,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"adventure, irascible, brotherly, and generous--they have all the"
4268,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,qualities that tempt men to war and make them good soldiers. Dazzled by
4269,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"their great fame on the Continent, and hearing of their insular wars"
4270,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"chiefly through the interested lies of England, Voltaire expressed his"
4271,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"wonder that a nation which had behaved so gallantly abroad had ""always"
4272,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"fought badly at home."" It would have been most wonderful."
4273,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,
4274,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,It may be conceded that the Irish performed more illustrious actions on
4275,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,the Continent. They fought with the advantages of French discipline and
4276,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"equipment; they fought as soldiers, with the rights of war, not"
4277,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"""rebels, with halters round their necks""; they fought by the side of"
4278,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,great rivals and amid the gaze of Europe.
4279,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,
4280,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,In the most of their domestic wars they appeared as divided clans or
4281,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,abrupt insurgents; they were exposed to the treachery of a more
4282,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"instructed, of an unscrupulous and a compact enemy; they had neither"
4283,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"discipline, nor generalship, nor arms; their victories were those of a"
4284,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,mob; their defeats were followed by extermination.
4285,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,
4286,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,We speak of their ordinary contests with England from the time of
4287,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,Roderick O'Connor to that of '98. Occasionally they had more
4288,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"opportunities, and their great qualities for war appeared. In Hugh (or,"
4289,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,rather Aodh) O'Neill they found a leader who only wanted material
4290,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"resources to have made them an independent nation. Cautious, as became"
4291,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"the heir of so long a strife, he spent years in acquiring military"
4292,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,knowledge and nursing up his clan into the kernel for a nation; crafty
4293,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"as Bacon and Cecil, and every other man of his time, he learned war in"
4294,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"Elizabeth's armies, and got help from her store-houses. When the"
4295,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"discontent of the Pale, religious tyranny, and the intrigues and"
4296,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"hostility of Spain and Rome against England gave him an opening, he put"
4297,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"his ordered clan into action, stormed the neighbouring garrisons,"
4298,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"struck terror into his hereditary foes, and gave hope to all patriots;"
4299,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"but finding that his ranks were too few for battle, he negotiated"
4300,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"successfully for peace, but unavailingly for freedom; his grievances"
4301,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"and designs remained, and he retired to repeat the same policy, till,"
4302,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"after repeated guerillas and truces, he was strong enough to proclaim"
4303,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"alliance with Spain and war with England, and to defeat and slay every"
4304,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"deputy that assailed him, till at last he marched from the triumph of"
4305,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,Beal-an-ath Buidhe[39] (where Marshal Bagenal and his army perished) to
4306,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"hold an almost royal court at Munster, and to reduce the Pale to the"
4307,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,limits it had formed in the Wars of the Roses; and even when the
4308,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"neglect of Spain, the genius of Mountjoy, the resources and intrigues"
4309,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"of England, and the exhaustion and divisions of Ireland had rendered"
4310,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"success hopeless, the Irish under O'Ruarc, O'Sullivan, and O'Doherty"
4311,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,vindicated their military character.
4312,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,
4313,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"From that period they, whose foreign services, since Dathi's time, had"
4314,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"been limited to supplying feudatories to the English kings, began to"
4315,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,fight under the flags of England's enemies in every corner of Europe.
4316,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"The artifices of the Stuarts regained them, and in the reign of Charles"
4317,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,the First they were extensively enlisted for the English allies and for
4318,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"the crown; but it was under the guidance of another O'Neill, and for"
4319,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"Ireland,[40] they again exhibited the qualities which had sustained"
4320,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,Tyrone. The battle of Benburb affords as great a proof of Irish
4321,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,soldiership as Fontenoy.
4322,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,
4323,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"But it was when, with a formal government and in a regular war, they"
4324,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"encountered the Dutch invader, they showed the full prowess of the"
4325,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"Irish; and at the Boyne, Limerick, Athlone, and Aughrim, in victory or"
4326,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"defeat, and always against _immensely superior numbers and armaments_,"
4327,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,proved that they fought well at home.
4328,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,
4329,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,Since the day when Sarsfield sailed the Irish have never had an
4330,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,opportunity of refuting the calumny of England which Voltaire accepted.
4331,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,In '98 they met enormous forces resting on all the magazines of
4332,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"England; they had no officers; their leaders, however brave, neither"
4333,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"knew how to organise, provision, station, or manoeuvre troops--their"
4334,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,arms were casual--their ignorance profound--their intemperance
4335,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,unrestrainable. If they put English supremacy in peril (and had Arklow
4336,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"or Ballinahinch been attacked with skill, that supremacy was gone),"
4337,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,they did so by mere valour.
4338,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,
4339,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"It is, therefore, on the Continent that one must chiefly look for Irish"
4340,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,trophies. It is a pious and noble search; but he who pursues it had
4341,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"need to guard against the error we have noticed in Voltaire, of"
4342,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,disparaging Irish soldiership at home.
4343,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,
4344,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,The materials for the history of the Irish Brigade are fast
4345,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,accumulating. We have before us the _Military History of the Irish
4346,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"Nation_, by the late Matthew O'Conor. He was a barrister, but studied"
4347,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"military subjects (as became a gentleman and a citizen), peculiarly"
4348,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"interested himself in the achievements of his countrymen, and prepared"
4349,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"materials for a history of them. He died, leaving his work unfinished,"
4350,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"yet, happily sufficiently advanced to offer a continuous narrative of"
4351,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"Irish internal wars, from Hugh O'Neill to Sarsfield, and of their"
4352,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"foreign services up to the Peace of Utrecht, in 1711. The style of the"
4353,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"work is earnest and glowing, full of patriotism and liberality; but Mr."
4354,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"O'Conor was no blind partisan, and he neither hides the occasional"
4355,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"excesses of the Irish, nor disparages their opponents. His descriptions"
4356,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,of battles are very superior to what one ordinarily meets in the works
4357,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"of civilians, and any one reading them with a military atlas will be"
4358,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,gratified and instructed.
4359,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,
4360,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"The value of the work is vastly augmented by the appendix, which is a"
4361,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"memoir of the Brigade, written in French, in 1749, and including the"
4362,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"War Office orders, and all the changes in organisation, numbers, and"
4363,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,pay of the Brigade to that date. This memoir is authenticated thus:--
4364,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,
4365,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"""His Excellency, the Duke of Feltré, Minister of War, was so kind"
4366,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"as to communicate to me the original memoir above cited, of which"

4376,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,names. It contains accounts of Hugh O'Neill's campaigns and of the wars
4377,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,of William and James in Ireland. It describes (certainly a new chapter
4378,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,in our knowledge) the services of the Irish in the Low Countries and
4379,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"France during the religious wars in Henri Quatre's time, and the"
4380,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,hitherto equally unknown actions abroad during Charles the Second's

4383,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"The wars of Mountcashel's (the old) Brigade in 1690-91, under St. Ruth"

4385,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"New Brigade, with the death of Sarsfield and Mountcashel, are carefully"
4386,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,narrated. The largest part of the work is occupied with the wars of the
4387,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"Spanish succession, and contains minute narratives of the battles and"
4388,THE IRISH BRIGADE.,"sieges of Cremona, Spire, Luzzaca, Blenheim, Cassano, Ramilies,"

4406,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"Of the long line of Protestant patriots Grattan is the first in genius,"
4407,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],and first in services. He had a more fervid and more Irish nature than
4408,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"Swift or Flood, and he accomplished what Swift hardly dreamed, and"
4409,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],Flood failed in--an Irish constitution. He had immeasurably more
4410,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],imagination than Tone; and though he was far behind the great Founder
4411,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"of the United Irishmen in organising power, he surpassed him in"
4412,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"inspiration. The statues of all shall be in our forums, and examples of"
4413,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"all in our hearts, but that of Grattan shall be pre-eminent. The"
4414,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],stubborn and advancing energy of Swift and Flood may teach us to bear
4415,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],up against wrong; the principles of Tone may end in liberation; but the
4416,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],splendid nationality of Grattan shall glorify us in every condition.
4417,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],
4418,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],The speeches of Grattan were collected and his memoirs written by his
4419,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],son. The latter is an accessible and an invaluable account of his life;
4420,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"but the speeches were out of print, not purchasable under five or six"
4421,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"guineas, and then were unmanageably numerous for any but a professed"
4422,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],politician. Mr. Madden's volume gives for a trifle all Grattan's most
4423,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"valuable speeches, with a memoir sufficient to explain the man and the"
4424,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],orator.
4425,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],
4426,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],On the speeches of Grattan here published we have little to say. They
4427,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"are the finest specimens of imaginative eloquence in the English, or in"
4428,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"any, language. There is not much pathos, and no humour in them, and in"
4429,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"these respects Grattan is far less of an Irishman, and of an orator"
4430,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"too, than Curran; but a philosophy, penetrating constitutions for their"
4431,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"warnings, and human nature for its guides--a statesman's (as"
4432,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],distinguished from an antiquarian's) use of history--a passionate scorn
4433,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"and invective for the base, tyrannical, and unjust--a fiery and copious"
4434,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"zeal for liberty and for Ireland, and a diction and cadence almost"
4435,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"lyrical, made Grattan the sudden achiever of a Revolution, and will"
4436,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],make him for ever one of the very elements of Ireland.
4437,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],
4438,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],No other orator is so uniformly animated. No other orator has
4439,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],brightened the depths of political philosophy with such vivid and
4440,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],lasting light. No writer in the language except Shakespeare has so
4441,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],sublime and suggestive a diction. His force and vehemence are
4442,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"amazing--far beyond Chatham, far beyond Fox, far beyond any orator we"
4443,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],can recall.
4444,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],
4445,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],To the student of oratory Grattan's speeches are dangerously
4446,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"suggestive, overpowering spirits that will not leave when bid. Yet,"
4447,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"with all this terrible potency, who would not bask in his genius, even"
4448,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],at the hazard of having his light for ever in your eyes. The brave
4449,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"student will rather exult in his effulgence--not to rob, not to mimic"
4450,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"it--but to catch its inspiration, and then go on his way resolved to"
4451,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"create a glory of his own which, however small, being genuine, shall"
4452,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],not pale within its sphere.
4453,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],
4454,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],To give a _just_ idea of Grattan's rush and splendour to anyone not
4455,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],familiar with his speeches is impossible; but _some_ glimmer may be
4456,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],got by one reading the extracts we shall add here. We shall take them
4457,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"at random, as we open the pages in the book, and leave the reader,"
4458,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"untaught in our great orator, to judge, if chance is certain of finding"
4459,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"such gems, what would not judicious care discover! Let him use that"

4464,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],will her heart be well at ease; never! so long as the parliament of
4465,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],England exercises or claims a legislation over this country: so
4466,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"long as this shall be the case, that very free trade, otherwise a"
4467,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"perpetual attachment, will be the cause of new discontent; it will"
4468,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],create a pride to feel the indignity of bondage; it will furnish a
4469,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"strength to bite your chain, and the liberty withheld will poison"
4470,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],the good communicated.
4471,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],
4472,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"""The British minister mistakes the Irish character; had he intended"
4473,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],to make Ireland a slave he should have kept her a beggar; there is
4474,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"no middle policy; win her heart by the restoration of her right, or"
4475,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"cut off the nation's right hand; greatly emancipate, or"
4476,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"fundamentally destroy. We may talk plausibly to England, but so"
4477,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"long as she exercises a power to bind this country, so long are the"
4478,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],nations in a state of war; the claims of the one go against the
4479,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"liberty of the other, and the sentiments of the latter go to oppose"
4480,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"those claims to the last drop of her blood. The English opposition,"
4481,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"therefore, are right; mere trade will not satisfy Ireland--they"
4482,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"judge of us by other great nations, by the nation whose political"
4483,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],life has been a struggle for liberty; they judge of us with a true
4484,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],knowledge and just deference for our character: that a country
4485,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"enlightened as Ireland, chartered as Ireland, armed as Ireland and"
4486,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"injured as Ireland, will be satisfied with nothing less than"

4571,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"falsehood--the condition of our connection--yes, the constitution"

4573,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"walk round it and round it, and the more he contemplates the more"

4575,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"and of blood a deluge, cheaply and nobly expended--whose"
4576,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"restoration had cost Ireland her noblest efforts, and was the"

4581,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"seated herself, as she vainly thought, in modest security and in a"

4585,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],the Babel which he builds; and as he throws down without a
4586,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"principle, so does he construct without a foundation. This fabric"
4587,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"he calls a Union, and to this, his fabric, there are two striking"
4588,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],objections--first it is no Union; it is not an identification of
4589,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"people, for it excludes the Catholics; secondly, it is a"
4590,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"consolidation of the Irish legislatures--that is to say, a merger"
4591,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"of the Irish parliament, and incurs every objection to a Union,"
4592,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],without obtaining the only object which a Union professes; it is an
4593,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"extinction of the constitution, and an exclusion of the people."
4594,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],Well! he has overlooked the people as he has overlooked the sea. I
4595,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"say he excludes the Catholics, and he destroys their best chance of"
4596,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"admission--the relative consequence. Thus he reasons, that"
4597,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"hereafter, in course of time (he does not say when), if they behave"
4598,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"themselves (he does not say how), they may see their subjects"
4599,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],submitted to a course of discussion (he does not say with what
4600,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"result or determination); and as the ground for this inane period,"
4601,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"in which he promises nothing, and in which, if he did promise much,"
4602,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"at so remote a period he could perform nothing, unless he, like the"
4603,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"evil he has accomplished, be immortal. For this inane sentence, in"
4604,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"which he can scarcely be said to deceive the Catholic, or suffer"
4605,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"the Catholic to deceive himself, he exhibits no other ground than"
4606,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"the physical inanity of the Catholic body accomplished by a Union,"
4607,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"which, as it destroys the relative importance of Ireland, so it"
4608,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"destroys the relative proportion of the Catholic inhabitants, and"
4609,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"thus they become admissible, because they cease to be anything."
4610,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"Hence, according to him, their brilliant expectation: 'You were,'"
4611,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"say his advocates, and so imports his argument, 'before the Union"
4612,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"as three to one, you will be by the Union as one to four.' Thus he"
4613,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],founds their hopes of political power on the extinction of physical
4614,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"consequence, and makes the inanity of their body and the nonentity"
4615,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"of their country the pillars of their future ambition."""
4616,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],
4617,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],We now return to the memoir by Mr. Madden. It is not the details of a
4618,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"life meagre for want of space, and confused for want of principles, as"
4619,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],most little biographies are; it is an estimate--a profound one--of
4620,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"Grattan's original nature, of the influences which acted on him from"
4621,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"youth to manhood, of his purposes, his principles, and his influence on"
4622,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],Ireland.
4623,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],
4624,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"Henry Grattan was twenty-nine years of age when he entered on politics,"
4625,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],and in seven years he was the triumphant leader of a people free and
4626,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],victorious after hereditary bondage. He entered parliament educated in
4627,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"the meta-physical and political philosophy of the time, injured by its"
4628,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],cold and epigrammatic verse and its artificial tastes--familiar with
4629,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"every form of aristocratic life from Kilkenny to London--familiar, too,"
4630,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"with Chatham's oratory and principles, and with Flood's views and"
4631,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],example. He came when there were great forces rushing through the
4632,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"land--eloquence, love of liberty, thirst for commerce, hatred of"
4633,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"English oppression, impatience, glory, and, above all, a military"
4634,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],array. He combined these elements and used them to achieve the
4635,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],Revolution of '82. Be he for ever honoured!
4636,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],
4637,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],Mr. Madden defends him against Flood on the question of Simple Repeal.
4638,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],Here is his reasoning:--
4639,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],
4640,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"""It is an easy thing now to dispose of the idle question of simple"
4641,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"repeal. In truth, there was nothing whatever deserving of attention"
4642,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],in the point raised by Mr. Flood. The security for the continuance
4643,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],of Irish freedom did not depend upon an English act of parliament.
4644,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],It was by Irish _will_ and not at English pleasure that the new
4645,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],constitution was to be supported. The transaction between the
4646,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"countries was of a high political nature, and it was to be judged by"
4647,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"political reason, and by statesmanlike computation, and not by the"
4648,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"petty technicalities of the court of law. The revolution of 1782, as"
4649,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"carried by Ireland, and assented to by England (in repealing the 6th"
4650,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"George the First), was a political compact--proposed by one country,"
4651,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],and acknowledged by the other in the face of Europe; it was not (as
4652,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],Mr. Flood and his partisans construed the transaction) of the nature
4653,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"of municipal right, to be enforced or annulled by mere judicial"
4654,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"exposition."""
4655,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],
4656,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"This is unanswerable, but Grattan should have gone further. The"
4657,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"Revolution was effected mainly by the Volunteers, whom he had inspired;"
4658,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],arms could alone have preserved the constitution. Flood was wrong in
4659,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],setting value on one form--Grattan in relying on any; but both before
4660,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],and after '82 Flood seems to have had glimpses that the question was
4661,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"one of might, as well as of right, and that national laws could not"
4662,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],last under such an alien army.
4663,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],
4664,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"Taken as military representatives, the Convention at the Rotunda was"
4665,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],even more valuable than as a civic display. Mr. Madden censures Grattan
4666,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],for having been an elaborate neutral during these Reform dissensions;
4667,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],but that the result of _such_ neutrality ruined the Convention
4668,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"proves a comparative want of power in Flood, who could have governed"
4669,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],that Convention in spite of the rascally English and the feeble Irish
4670,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"Whigs. Oh, had Tone been in that council!"
4671,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],
4672,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],In describing Grattan's early and enthusiastic and ceaseless advocacy
4673,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"of Catholic liberty, Mr. Madden has a just subject for unmixed eulogy."
4674,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],Let no one imagine that the interest of these Emancipation speeches has
4675,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],died with the achievement of what they pleaded for; they will ever
4676,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],remain divinest protests against the vice and impolicy of religious
4677,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"ascendency, of sectarian bitterness, and of bigot separation."
4678,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],
4679,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],For this admirable beginning of the design of giving Ireland its most
4680,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"glorious achievement--the speeches of its orators--to contemplate, the"
4681,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],country should be grateful; but if there can be anything better for it
4682,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"to hear than can be had in Grattan's speeches, it is such language as"
4683,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],this from his eloquent editor:--
4684,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],
4685,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"""Reader! if you be an Irish Protestant, and entertain harsh"
4686,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"prejudices against your Catholic countrymen, study the works and"
4687,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],life of Grattan--learn from him--for none can teach you better how
4688,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],to purify your nature from bigotry. Learn from him to look upon all
4689,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],your countrymen with a loving heart--to be tolerant of infirmities
4690,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"caused by their unhappy history--and, like Grattan, earnestly"
4691,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],sympathise with all that is brave and generous in their character.
4692,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],
4693,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"""Reader! if you be an Irish Catholic, and that you confound the"
4694,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"Protestant religion with tyranny, learn from Grattan that it is"
4695,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],possible to be a Protestant and have a heart for Ireland and its
4696,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],people. Think that the brightest age of Ireland was when Grattan--a
4697,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],steady Protestant--raised it to proud eminence; think also that in
4698,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],the hour of his triumph he did not forget the state of your
4699,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"oppressed fathers, but laboured through his virtuous life that both"
4700,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],you and your children should enjoy unshackled liberty of
4701,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],conscience.
4702,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],
4703,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"""But reader! whether you be Protestant or Catholic, or whatever be"
4704,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"your party, you will do well as an Irishman to ponder upon the"
4705,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],spirit and principles which governed the public and private life of
4706,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],Grattan. Learn from him how to regard your countrymen of all
4707,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"denominations. Observe, as he did, how very much that is excellent"
4708,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],belongs to both the great parties into which Ireland is divided. If
4709,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"(as some do) you entertain dispiriting views of Ireland, recollect"
4710,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],that any country containing such elements as those which roused the
4711,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],genius of Grattan never need despair. _Sursum corda_. Be not
4712,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],disheartened.
4713,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],
4714,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"""Go--go--my countrymen--and, within your social sphere, carry into"
4715,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"practice those moral principles which Grattan so eloquently taught,"
4716,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],and which he so remarkably enforced by his well-spent life. He will
4717,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],teach you to avoid hating men on account of their religious
4718,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],professions or hereditary descent. From him you will learn
4719,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"principles which, if carried out, would generate a new state of"
4720,THE SPEECHES OF GRATTAN.[41],"society in Ireland."""

4754,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"and you will see a snug homestead, kept clean, prettily sheltered (much"
4755,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,what you'd see in Down); more green crops than even in Ulster; the
4756,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"National School and the Repeal Reading-room well filled, and every"

4759,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"Wexford is not all it might be, or all that, with more education and"
4760,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"the life-hope of nationality, it will be--there is something to blame"
4761,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"and something to lament, here a vice sustained, and there a misfortune"
4762,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"lazily borne; yet, take it for all in all, it is the most prosperous,"
4763,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,it is the pattern county of the South; and when we see it coming
4764,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"forward in a mass to renew its demand for native government, it is an"
4765,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"omen that the spirit of the people outlives quarrels and jealousies,"
4766,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,and that it has a rude vitality which will wear out its oppressors.
4767,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,
4768,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,Nor are we indifferent to the memories of Wexford. It owes much of its
4769,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,peace and prosperity to the war it sustained. It rose in '98 with
4770,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,little organisation against intolerable wrong; and though it was
4771,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"finally beaten by superior forces, it taught its aristocracy and the"
4772,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,government a lesson not easily forgotten--a lesson that popular anger
4773,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,could strike hard as well as sigh deeply; and that it was better to
4774,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,conciliate than provoke those who even for an hour had felt their
4775,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,strength. The red rain made Wexford's harvest grow. Theirs was no
4776,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,treacherous assassination--theirs no stupid riot--theirs no pale
4777,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,mutiny. They rose in mass and swept the country by sheer force.
4778,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,
4779,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,Nor in their sinking fortunes is there anything to blush at.
4780,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,Scullabogue was not burned by the fighting men.
4781,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,
4782,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,Yet nowhere did the copper sun of that July burn upon a more
4783,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"heart-piercing sight than a rebel camp. Scattered on a hill-top, or"
4784,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"screened in a gap, were the grey-coated thousands, their memories mad"
4785,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"at burned cabins, and military whips, and hanged friends; their hopes"
4786,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,dimmed by partial defeat; their eyes lurid with care; their brows full
4787,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,of gloomy resignation. Some have short guns which the stern of a boat
4788,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"might bear, but which press through the shoulder of a marching man; and"
4789,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"others have light fowling-pieces, with dandy locks--troublesome and"
4790,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"dangerous toys. Most have pikes, stout weapons, too; and though some"
4791,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"swell to hand-spikes, and others thin to knives, yet, for all that,"
4792,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,fatal are they to dragoon or musketeer if they can meet him in a rush;
4793,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,but how shall they do so? The gunsmen have only a little powder in
4794,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"scraps of paper or bags, and their balls are few and rarely fit. They"
4795,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"have no potatoes ripe, and they have no bread--their food is the worn"
4796,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"cattle they have crowded there, and which the first skirmish may rend"
4797,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"from them. There are women and children seeking shelter, seeking those"
4798,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"they love; and there are leaders busier, feebler, less knowing, less"
4799,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,resolved than the women and the children.
4800,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,
4801,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,Great hearts! how faithful ye are! How ye bristled up when the foe came
4802,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"on, how ye set your teeth to die as his shells and round-shot fell"
4803,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"steadily; and with how firm a cheer ye dashed at him, if he gave you"
4804,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,any chance at all of a grapple! From the wild burst with which ye
4805,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"triumphed at Oulart Hill, down to the faint gasp wherewith the last of"
4806,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"your last column died in the corn-fields of Meath, there is nothing to"
4807,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"shame your valour, your faith, or your patriotism. You wanted arms, and"
4808,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"you wanted leaders. Had you had them, you would have guarded a green"
4809,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"flag in Dublin Castle a week after you beat Walpole. Isolated,"
4810,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"unorganised, unofficered, half-armed, girt by a swarm of foes, you"
4811,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"ceased to fight, but you neither betrayed nor repented. Your sons need"

4814,MEMORIALS OF WEXFORD.,"You, people of Wexford, almost all Repealers, are the sons of the men"

4825,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,
4826,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,
4827,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,From 1793 to 1829--for thirty-six years--the Irish Catholics struggled
4828,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,for Emancipation. _That_ Emancipation was but admission to the
4829,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"Bench, the Inner Bar, and Parliament. It was won by self-denial,"
4830,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"genius, vast and sustained labours, and, lastly, by the sacrifice of"
4831,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,the forty-shilling freeholders--the poor veterans of the war--and by
4832,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,submission to insulting oaths; yet it was cheaply bought. Not so
4833,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"cheaply, perchance, as if won by the sword; for on it were expended"
4834,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"more treasures, more griefs, more intellect, more passion, more of all"
4835,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"which makes life welcome, than had been needed for war; still it was"
4836,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"cheaply bought, and Ireland has glorified herself, and will through"
4837,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,ages triumph in the victory of '29.
4838,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,
4839,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,Yet what was Emancipation compared to Repeal?
4840,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,
4841,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,The one put a silken badge on a few members of one profession; the
4842,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,other would give to all professions and all trades the rank and riches
4843,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"which resident proprietors, domestic legislation, and flourishing"
4844,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,commerce infallibly create.
4845,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,
4846,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,Emancipation made it possible for Catholics to sit on the judgment
4847,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"seat; but it left a foreign administration, which has excluded them,"
4848,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"save in two or three cases, where over-topping eminence made the"
4849,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,acceptance of a Judgeship no promotion; and it left the local
4850,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"Judges--those with whom the people have to deal--as partial, ignorant,"
4851,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,bigoted as ever; while Repeal would give us an Irish code and
4852,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"Irish-hearted Judges in every Court, from the Chancery to the Petty"
4853,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,Sessions.
4854,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,
4855,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,Emancipation dignified a dozen Catholics with a senatorial name in a
4856,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"foreign and hostile Legislature. Repeal would give us a Senate, a"
4857,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"Militia, an Administration, all our own."
4858,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,
4859,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"The Penal Code, as it existed since 1793, insulted the faith of the"
4860,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"Catholics, restrained their liberties, and violated the public Treaty"
4861,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"of Limerick. The Union has destroyed our manufactures, prohibits our"
4862,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"flag, prevents our commerce, drains our rental, crushes our genius,"
4863,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"makes our taxation a tribute, our representation a shadow, our name a"
4864,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,by-word. It were nobler to strive for Repeal than to get Emancipation.
4865,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,
4866,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"Four years ago the form of Repeal agitation began--two years ago, its"
4867,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,reality. Have we not cause to be proud of the labours of these two
4868,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"years? If life be counted, not by the rising of suns, or the idle"
4869,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"turning of machinery, but by the growth of the will, and the progress"
4870,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"of thoughts and passions in the soul, we Irishmen have spent an age"
4871,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"since we raised our first cry for liberty. Consider what we were then,"
4872,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,and what we have done since. We had a People unorganised--disgusted
4873,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,with a Whig alliance--beaten in a dishonourable struggle to sustain a
4874,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"faction--ignorant of each other's will--without books, without song,"
4875,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"without leaders (save one), without purposes, without strength, without"
4876,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"hope. The Corn Exchange was the faint copy of the Catholic Association,"
4877,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"with a few enthusiasts, a few loungers, and a few correspondents."
4878,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"Opposite to us was the great Conservative party, with a majority"
4879,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"exceeding our whole representation, united, flushed, led by the"
4880,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"craftiest of living statesmen, and the ablest of living generals. Oh,"
4881,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"how disheartening it was then, when, day by day, we found prophecy and"
4882,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"exhortation, lay and labour, flung idly before a distracted People! May"
4883,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,we never pass through that icy ordeal again!
4884,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,
4885,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,How different now! The People are united under the greatest system of
4886,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"organisation ever attempted in any country. They send in, by their"
4887,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"Collectors, Wardens, and Inspectors, to the central office of Ireland,"
4888,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"the contributions needed to carry on the Registration of Voters, the"
4889,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"public meetings, the publications, the law expenses, and the"
4890,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,organisation of the Association; and that in turn carries on
4891,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"registries, holds meetings, opens reading-rooms, sends newspapers, and"
4892,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"books, and political instructions, back through the same channel; so"
4893,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"that the Central Committee knows the state of every parish, and every"
4894,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,parish receives the teaching and obeys the will of the Central
4895,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,Committee.
4896,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,
4897,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"The Whig Alliance has melted, like ice before the sun, and the strong"
4898,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,souls of our people will never again serve the purposes of a faction.
4899,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,
4900,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"The Conservative party, without union and without principle, is"
4901,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,breaking up. Its English section is dividing into the tools of
4902,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,expediency and the pioneers of a New Generation--its Irish section into
4903,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,Castle Hacks and National Conservatives.
4904,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,
4905,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"Meantime, how much have the Irish people gained and done? They have"
4906,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,received and grown rich under torrents of thought. Song and sermon and
4907,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"music, speech and pamphlet, novel and history, essay and map and"
4908,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"picture, have made the dull thoughtful and the thoughtful studious, and"
4909,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,will make the studious wise and powerful. They have begun a system of
4910,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"self-teaching in their reading-rooms. If they carry it we shall, before"
4911,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"two years, have in every parish men able to manufacture, to trade, and"
4912,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"to farm--men acquainted with all that Ireland was, is, and should"
4913,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,be--men able to serve The Irish Nation in peace and war.
4914,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,
4915,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"In the teeth, too, of the Government we held our meetings. They are not"
4916,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"for this time, but they were right well in their own time. They showed"
4917,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"our physical force to the Continent, to ourselves, to America, to our"
4918,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"rulers. They showed that the people would come and go rapidly,"
4919,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"silently, and at bidding, in numbers enough to recruit a dozen armies."
4920,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,These are literal facts. Any one monster meeting could have offered
4921,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"little resistance in the open country to a regular army, but it"
4922,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"contained the materials--the numbers, intelligence, and obedience--of a"
4923,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,conquering host. Whenever the impression of their power grows faint we
4924,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,shall revive them again.
4925,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,
4926,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,The toleration of these meetings was the result of fear; the
4927,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,prosecution of their chiefs sprung from greater fear. That prosecution
4928,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"was begun audaciously, was carried on meanly and with virulence, and"
4929,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,ended with a charge and a verdict which disgraced the law. An illegal
4930,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,imprisonment afforded glorious proof that the people could refrain from
4931,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"violence under the worst temptation; that their leaders were firm; and,"
4932,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"better than all, that had these leaders been shot, not prisoned, their"
4933,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,successors were ready. Such an imprisonment served Ireland more than an
4934,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"acquittal, for it tried her more; and then came the day of triumph,"
4935,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,when the reluctant constitution liberated our chiefs and branded our
4936,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,oppressors.
4937,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,
4938,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,This is a history of two years never surpassed in importance and
4939,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,honour. This is a history which our sons shall pant over and envy. This
4940,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,is a history which pledges us to perseverance. This is a history which
4941,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,guarantees success.
4942,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,
4943,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"Energy, patience, generosity, skill, tolerance, enthusiasm created and"
4944,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,decked the agitation. The world attended us with its thoughts and
4945,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,prayers. The graceful genius of Italy and the profound intellect of
4946,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,Germany paused to wish us well. The fiery heart of France tolerated our
4947,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"unarmed effort, and proffered its aid. America sent us money, thought,"
4948,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,love--she made herself a part of Ireland in her passions and her
4949,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,organisation. From London to the wildest settlement which throbs in the
4950,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"tropics or shivers nigh the Pole, the empire of our misruler was shaken"
4951,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,by our effort. To all earth we proclaimed our wrongs. To man and God we
4952,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,made oath that we would never cease to strive till an Irish nation
4953,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"stood supreme on this island. The genius which roused and organised us,"
4954,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"the energy which laboured, the wisdom that taught, the manhood which"
4955,THE HISTORY OF TO-DAY.,"rose up, the patience which obeyed, the faith which swore, and the"

4971,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"Dr. Kane has at length answered it, and proved the affirmative."
4972,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],Confining himself strictly to the _land_ of our island (for he does not

4974,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],that we possess _physical_ elements for every important art. Not that
4975,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"he sat down to prove this. Taste, duty, industry, and genius prompted"
4976,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],and enabled him gradually to acquire a knowledge of the physical
4977,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"products and powers of Ireland, and his mastery of chemical and"
4978,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],mechanical science enabled him to see how these could be used.

4980,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"Thus qualified, he tried, in the lecture-room of the Dublin Society, to"

4988,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"through our topographical works and parliamentary reports, but that"
4989,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"information is, for the most part, vague, unapplied, and not tested by"
4990,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"science. Dr. Kane's work is full, clear, scientific, exact in stating"
4991,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"places, extent, prices, and every other working detail, and is a manual"
4992,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],of the whole subject.
4993,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],
4994,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],In such interlaced subjects as industrial resources we must be content

5000,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"sulphur, marble, slates, etc. Thirdly, the agriculture of the country"
5001,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"in its first function--the raising of food, and the modes of cropping,"
5002,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"manuring, draining, and stacking. Fourthly, agriculture in its"
5003,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"secondary use, as furnishing staples for the manufacture of woollens,"
5004,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"linens, starch, sugar, spirits, etc. Fifthly, the modes of carrying"

5006,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"condition of skilled and unskilled labour in Ireland. Seventhly, our"
5007,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],state as to capital. And he closes by some earnest and profound
5008,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],thoughts on the need of industrial education in Ireland.

5010,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"Now, let us ask the reader what he knows upon any or all of these"

5013,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"here must be got rid of, or our cry of ""Ireland for the Irish"" will be"

5053,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],The two great mechanical powers are fire and water. Ireland is nobly
5054,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],endowed with both.

5056,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],We do not possess as ample fields of flaming coal as Britain; but even
5057,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"of that we have large quantities, which can be raised at about the same"
5058,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],rate at which English coal can be landed on our coast.
5059,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],
5060,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],The chief seats of flaming coal in Ireland are to the west of Lough
5061,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"Allen, in Connaught, and around Dungannon, in Tyrone. There is a small"
5062,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],district of it in Antrim.

5064,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"The stone coal, or anthracite, which, having little gas, does not"
5065,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"blaze, and, having much sulphur, is disagreeable in a room, and has"
5066,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"been thought unfit for smelting, is found--first, in the Kilkenny"
5067,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"district, between the Nore and Barrow; secondly, from Freshford to"
5068,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"Cashel; and thirdly, in the great Munster coal country, cropping up in"
5069,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"every barony of Clare, Limerick, Cork, and Kerry. By the use of vapour"

5072,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"than the flaming coal, there seems no reason to doubt that in it we"
5073,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],have a manufacturing power that would supply us for generations.
5074,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],
5075,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],Our bogs have not been done justice to. The use of turf in a damp state
5076,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"turns it into an inferior fuel. Dried under cover, or broken up and"
5077,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"dried under pressure, it is more economical, because far more"
5078,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"efficient. It is used now in the Shannon steamers, and its use is"
5079,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"increasing in mills. For some purposes it is peculiarly good--thus, for"
5080,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"the finer ironworks, turf and turf-charcoal are even better than wood,"
5081,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"and Dr. Kane shows that the precious Baltic iron, for which from £15 to"
5082,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"£35 per ton is given, could be equalled by Irish iron smelted by Irish"
5083,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],turf for six guineas per ton.
5084,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],
5085,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"Dr. Kane proves that the cost of fuel, even if greater in Ireland, by"
5086,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],no means precludes us from competing with England; he does so by
5087,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],showing that the cost of fuel in English factories is only from 1 to
5088,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"1-1/2 per cent., while in Ireland it would be only 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 per"
5089,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"cent., a difference greatly overbalanced by our cheaper labour--labour"
5090,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],being over 33 per cent. of the whole expense of a factory.

5092,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],Here is the analysis of the cost of producing cotton in England in
5093,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],1830:--

5103,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],
5104,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],In water-power we are still better off. Dr. Kane calculates the rain
5105,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],which falls on Ireland in a year at over 100 billion cubic yards; and
5106,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"of this he supposes two-thirds to pass off in evaporation, leaving"
5107,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"one-third, equal to nearly a million and a half of horse-power, to"
5108,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],reach the sea. His calculations of the water-power of the Shannon and
5109,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"other rivers are most interesting. The elements, of course, are the"
5110,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"observed fall of rain by the gauge in the district, and the area of the"
5111,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],catchment (or drainage) basins of each river and its tributaries. The
5112,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],chief objection to water-power is its irregularity. To remedy this he
5113,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],proposes to do what has increased the water-power on the Bann
5114,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"five-fold, and has made the wealth of Greenock--namely, to make"
5115,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"mill-lakes by damming up valleys, and thus controlling and equalising"
5116,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"the supply of water, and letting none go waste. His calculations of the"
5117,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"relative merits of undershot, overshot, breast, and turbine wheels are"
5118,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"most valuable, especially of the last, which is a late and successful"
5119,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"French contrivance, acting by pressure. He proposes to use the turbine"
5120,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"in coast mills, the tide being the motive-power; and, strange as it"
5121,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"sounds, the experiments seem to decide in favour of this plan."
5122,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],
5123,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"""The turbine was invented by M. Fourneyron. Coals being abundant,"
5124,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"the steam engine is invented in England; coals being scarce, the"
5125,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],water-pressure engine and the turbine are invented in France. It is
5126,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],thus the physical condition of each country directs its mechanical
5127,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],genius. The turbine is a horizontal wheel furnished with curved
5128,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"float-boards, on which the water presses from a cylinder which is"
5129,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"suspended over the wheel, and the base of which is divided by"
5130,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"curved partitions, that the water may be directed in issuing, so as"
5131,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],to produce upon the curved float-boards of the wheel its greatest
5132,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],effect. The best curvature to be given to the fixed partitions and
5133,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"to the float-boards is a delicate problem, but practically it has"
5134,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"been completely solved. The construction of the machine is simple,"
5135,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],its parts not liable to go out of order; and as the action of the
5136,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"water is by pressure, the force is under the most favourable"
5137,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],circumstances for being utilised.
5138,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],
5139,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"""The effective economy of the turbine appears to equal that of the"
5140,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],overshot wheel. But the economy in the turbine is accompanied by
5141,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],some conditions which render it peculiarly valuable. In a
5142,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],water-wheel you cannot have great economy of power without very
5143,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"slow motion, and hence where high velocity is required at the"
5144,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"working point, a train of mechanism is necessary, which causes a"
5145,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"material loss of force. Now, in the turbine the greatest economy is"
5146,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"accompanied by rapid motion, and hence the connected machinery may"
5147,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],be rendered much less complex. In the turbine also a change in the
5148,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],height of the head of water alters only the power of the machine in
5149,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"that proportion, but the whole quantity of water is economised to"
5150,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],the same degree. Thus if a turbine be working with a force of ten
5151,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"horses, and that its supply of water be suddenly doubled, it"
5152,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],becomes of twenty horse-power; if the supply be reduced to
5153,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"one-half, it still works five horse-power; whilst such sudden and"
5154,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"extreme change would altogether disarrange water-wheels, which can"
5155,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"only be constructed for the minimum, and allow the overplus to go"
5156,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"to waste."""
5157,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],
5158,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"Our own predilection being in favour of water-power--as cheaper,"
5159,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"healthier, and more fit for Ireland than steam--gave the following"
5160,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],peculiar interest in our eyes:--
5161,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],
5162,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"""I have noticed at such length the question of the cost of fuel and"
5163,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"of steam power, not from my own opinion of its ultimate importance,"
5164,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],but that we might at once break down that barrier to all active
5165,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],exertion which indolent ignorance constantly retreats behind. The
5166,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"cry of 'What can we do? consider England's coal-mines,' is answered"
5167,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],by showing that we have available fuel enough. The lament that
5168,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"coals are so dear with us and so cheap in England, is, I trust, set"
5169,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],at rest by the evidence of how little influential the price of fuel
5170,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"is. However, there are other sources of power besides coals; there"
5171,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"are other motive-powers than steam. Of the 83,000 horse-power"
5172,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"employed to give motion to mills in England, 21,000, even in the"
5173,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"coal districts, are not moved by fire, but by water. The force of"
5174,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],gravity in falling water can spin and weave as well as the
5175,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],elasticity of steam; and in this power we are not deficient. It is
5176,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"necessary to study its circumstances in detail, and I shall"
5177,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],therefore next proceed to discuss the condition of Ireland with
5178,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"regard to water-power."""
5179,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],
5180,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],Dr. Kane proves that we have at Arigna an _inexhaustible_ supply
5181,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"of the richest iron ore, with coals to smelt it, lime to flux it, and"
5182,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],infusible sand-stone and fire-clay to make furnaces of on the spot. Yet
5183,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],not a pig or bar is made there now. He also gives in great detail the
5184,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"extent, analysis, costs of working, and every other leading fact as to"
5185,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"the copper mines of Wicklow, Knockmahon, and Allihies; the lead, gold,"
5186,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"and sulphur mines of Wicklow; the silver mines of Ballylichey, and"
5187,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],details of the building materials and marbles.

5189,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"He is everywhere precise in his industrial and scientific statements,"
5190,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],and beautifully clear in his style and arrangement.
5191,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],
5192,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"Why, then, are we a poor province? Dr. Kane quotes Forbes, Quetelet,"
5193,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"etc., to prove the physical strength of our people. He might have"
5194,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],quoted every officer who commanded them to prove their courage and
5195,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],endurance; nor is there much doubt expressed even by their enemies of
5196,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],their being quick and inventive. Their soil is productive--the rivers
5197,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],and harbours good--their fishing _opportunities_ great--so is their
5198,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],means of making internal communications across their great central
5199,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"plains. We have immense water and considerable fire power; and, besides"
5200,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"the minerals necessary for the arts of peace, we are better supplied"
5201,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"than almost any country with the finer sorts of iron, charcoal, and"
5202,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"sulphur, wherewith war is now carried on. Why is it, with these means"
5203,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"of amassing and guarding wealth, that we are so poor and paltry? Dr."
5204,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],Kane thinks we are so from want of industrial education. He is partly
5205,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"right. The remote causes were repeated foreign invasion, forfeiture,"
5206,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"and tyrannous laws. Ignorance, disunion, self-distrust, quick"
5207,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"credulity, and caprice were the weaknesses engendered in us by"
5208,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],misfortune and misgovernment; and they were then the allies of
5209,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"oppression; for, had we been willing, we had long ago been rich and"
5210,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],free. Knowledge is now within our reach if we work steadily; and
5211,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],strength of character will grow upon us by every month of perseverance
5212,THE RESOURCES OF IRELAND.[42],"and steadiness in politics, trade, and literature."

5226,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,
5227,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,The Committee of 1824 was but meagrely supplied with evidence as to
5228,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,foreign surveys. They begin that subject with a notice of the Survey of
5229,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"England, made by order of William the Conqueror, and called the"
5230,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"Doomsday Book. That book took six years to execute, and is most"
5231,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,admirably analysed by Thierry.
5232,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,
5233,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,The following is their summary account of some modern surveys:--
5234,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,
5235,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"""In France the great territorial survey or _cadastre_ has been in"
5236,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"progress for many years. It was first suggested in 1763, and after"
5237,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"an interval of thirty years, during which no progress was made, it"
5238,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"was renewed by the government of that day, and individuals of the"
5239,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"highest scientific reputation, MM. Lagrange, Laplace, and Delambre,"
5240,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,were consulted with respect to the best mode of carrying into
5241,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,effect the intention of government. Subsequent events suspended any
5242,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"effectual operations in the French _cadastre_ till the year 1802,"
5243,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,when a school of topographical engineering was organised. The
5244,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,operations now in progress were fully commenced in 1808. The
5245,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,principle adopted is the formation of a central commission acting
5246,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,in conjunction with the local authorities; the classification of
5247,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"lands, according to an ascertained value, is made by three resident"
5248,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"proprietors of land in each district, selected by the municipal"
5249,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"council, and by the chief officer of revenue. 'In the course of"
5250,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"thirteen years, one-third only of each department had been"
5251,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"surveyed, having cost the state £120,000 per annum. At the rate at"
5252,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"which it is carried on, it may be computed as likely to require for"
5253,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"its completion a total sum of £4,680,000, or an acreable charge of"
5254,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"8-3/4d.' The delay of the work, as well as the increase of expense,"
5255,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"seem to have been the result of the minuteness of the survey, which"
5256,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"extends to every district field--a minuteness which, for many"
5257,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"reasons, your committee consider both unnecessary and inexpedient"
5258,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,to be sought for in the proposed Survey of Ireland.
5259,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,
5260,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"""The survey of Bavaria is of modern date, but of equal minuteness."
5261,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"It is commenced by a primary triangulation, and principal and"
5262,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"verification bases; it is carried on to a second triangulation,"
5263,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"with very accurate instruments, so as to determine 'all the"
5264,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,principal points; the filling up the interior is completed by a
5265,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,peculiar species of plane table; and in order to do away with the
5266,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"inaccuracies of the common chain, the triangulation is carried down"
5267,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,on paper to the most minute corners of fields.' _The map is laid
5268,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"down on a scale of twelve inches to the mile, or"
5269,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,one-five-thousandth part of the real size; and as it contains all
5270,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"that is required in the most precise survey of property, it is used"
5271,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,in the purchase and sale of real estates._
5272,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,
5273,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"""The cadastre of Savoy and Piedmont began in 1729, and is stated to"
5274,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,have at once afforded the government the means of apportioning
5275,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"justly all the territorial contributions, and to have put an end to"
5276,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"litigations between individuals, by ascertaining, satisfactorily,"
5277,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,the bounds of properties.
5278,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,
5279,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"""The Neapolitan survey under Visconti, and that of the United"
5280,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"States under Heslar, are both stated to be in progress; but your"
5281,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,committee have not had the means of ascertaining on what principles
5282,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"they are conducted."""
5283,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,
5284,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,The committee adopted a scale for the maps of six inches to a statute
5285,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"mile, believing, apparently with justice, that a six-inch scale map, if"
5286,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"perfectly well executed, would be minute enough for buyers and sellers"
5287,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"of land, especially as the larger holdings are generally townlands, the"
5288,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"bounds of which they meant to include. And, wherever a greater scale"
5289,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"was needed, the pentagraph afforded a sufficiently accurate plan of"
5290,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"forming maps to it. They, in another point, _proposed_ to differ from"
5291,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"the Bavarian Survey, in omitting field boundaries, as requiring too"
5292,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"much time and expense; but they stated that barony, parish, and"
5293,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,townland boundaries were essential to the utility of the maps. They
5294,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,also seemed to think that for private purposes their utility would much
5295,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"depend on their being accompanied, as the Bavarian maps were, by a"
5296,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"memoir of the number of families, houses, size, and description of"
5297,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"farms, and a valuation. And for this purpose they printed all the"
5298,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"forms. The valuation still goes on of the townlands, and classes of"
5299,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"soil in each. The Statistical Memoir has, unfortunately, been stopped,"
5300,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"and no survey or valuation of farms, or holdings as such, has been"
5301,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,attempted. We would _now_ only recall attention to the design of the
5302,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,Committee of 1824 on the subject.
5303,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,
5304,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"They proposed to leave the whole Survey to the Board of Ordnance, and"
5305,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,the Valuation to Civil Engineers.
5306,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,
5307,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"The Valuation has been regulated by a series of Acts of Parliament, and"
5308,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,we shall speak of it presently.
5309,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,
5310,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"The Survey commenced in 1826, and has gone on under the superintendence"
5311,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"of Colonel Colby, and the local control of Captain Larcom."
5312,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,
5313,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"The following has been its progress:--First, a base line of about five"
5314,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"miles was measured on the flat shore of Lough Foyle, and from thence"
5315,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,triangular measurements were made by the theodolite and over the whole
5316,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"country, and all the chief points of mountain, coast, etc.,"
5317,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,ascertained. How accurately this was done has been proved by an
5318,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,astronomical measurement of the distance from Dublin to Armagh (about
5319,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"seventy miles), which only differed four feet from the distance"
5320,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,calculated by the Ordnance triangles.
5321,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,
5322,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"Having completed these large triangles, a detailed survey of the"
5323,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"baronies, parishes, and townlands of each county followed. The field"
5324,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"books were sent to the central station at Mountjoy, and sketched,"
5325,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"engraved on copper, and printed there. The first county published was"
5326,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"Derry, in 1833, and now the townland survey is finished, and all the"
5327,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"counties have now been engraved and issued, except Limerick, Kerry, and"
5328,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,Cork.
5329,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,
5330,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,The Survey has also engraved a map of Dublin City on the enormous scale
5331,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,of five feet to a statute mile. This map represents the shape and space
5332,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"occupied by every house, garden, yard, and pump in Dublin. It contains"
5333,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"antiquarian lettering. Every house, too, is numbered on the map. One of"

5335,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"is on sale, as we trust the rest of it will be."
5336,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,
5337,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,Two other sets of maps remain to be executed. First--maps of the towns
5338,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"of Ireland, on a scale of five feet to a mile. Whatever may be said in"
5339,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,reply to Sir Denham Norrey's demand for a survey of holdings in rural
5340,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"districts does not apply to the case of towns, and we, therefore, trust"
5341,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,that the holdings will be marked and separately valued in towns.
5342,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,
5343,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"The other work is a general _shaded_ map of Ireland, on a scale of one"
5344,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"inch to the statute mile. At present, as we elsewhere remarked, the"
5345,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"only tolerable shaded map of Ireland is that of the Railway Commission,"
5346,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,which is on a scale of one inch to four statute miles. Captain Larcom
5347,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"proposes, and the Commission on the Ordnance Memoir recommend, that"
5348,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,contour lines should be the skeleton of the shading. If this plan be
5349,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,adopted the publication cannot be for some years; but the shading will
5350,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,have the accuracy of machine-work instead of mere hand skill. Contours
5351,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"are lines representing series of levels through a country, and are"
5352,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"inestimable for draining, road-making, and military movements. But"
5353,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"though easily explained to the eye, we doubt our ability to teach their"
5354,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,meaning by words only.
5355,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,
5356,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,To return to the townland or six-inch survey. The names were corrected
5357,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"by Messrs. Petrie, O'Donovan, and Curry, from every source accessible"
5358,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"in _Ireland_. Its maps contain the county, barony, parish, townland,"
5359,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"and glebe boundaries, names and acreage; names and representations of"
5360,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"all cities, towns, demesnes, farms, ruins, collieries, forges,"
5361,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"limekilns, tanneries, bleach-greens, wells, etc., etc.; also of all"
5362,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"roads, rivers, canals, bridges, locks, weirs, bogs, ruins, churches,"
5363,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,chapels; they have also the number of feet of every little swell of
5364,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"land, and a mark for every cabin."
5365,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,
5366,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"Of course these maps run to an immense number. Thus, for the county of"
5367,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"Galway there are 137 double folio sheets, and for the small county of"
5368,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"Dublin, 28. Where less than half the sheet is covered with engraving"
5369,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"(as occurs towards the edges of a county) the sheet is sold,"
5370,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"uncoloured, for 2_s._ 6_d._; where more than half is covered the price"
5371,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,is 5_s._
5372,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,
5373,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,In order to enable you to find any sheet so as to know the bearings of
5374,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"its ground on any other, there is printed for each county an index map,"
5375,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,representing the whole county on one sheet. This sheet is on a small
5376,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"scale (from one to three miles to an inch), but contains in smaller"
5377,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"type the baronies and parishes, roads, rivers, demesnes, and most of"
5378,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,the information of general interest. This index map is divided by lines
5379,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"into as many oblong spaces as there are maps of the six-inch scale, and"
5380,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,the spaces are numbered to correspond with the six-inch map. On the
5381,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,sides of the index maps are tables of the acreage of the baronies and
5382,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,parishes; and examples of the sort of marks and type used for each
5383,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"class of subjects in the _six-inch_ maps. Uncoloured, the index map,"
5384,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"representing a whole county, is sold for 2_s._ 6_d._"
5385,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,
5386,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"Whenever those maps are re-engraved, the Irish words will, we trust, be"
5387,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"spelled in an Irish and civilised orthography, and not barbarously, as"
5388,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,at present.
5389,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,
5390,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"It was proposed to print for each county one or more volumes,"
5391,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"containing the history of the district and its antiquities, the"
5392,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"numbers, and past and present state and occupations of the people, the"
5393,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"state of its agriculture, manufactures, mines, and fisheries, and what"
5394,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"means of extending these existed in the county, and its natural"
5395,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"history, including geology, zoology, etc. All this was done for the"
5396,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"town of Derry, much to the service and satisfaction of its people. All"
5397,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"this ought to be _as fully_ done for Armagh, Dublin, Cork, and every"
5398,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,other part of Ireland.
5399,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,
5400,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,The commissioners recommend that the geology of Ireland (and we would
5401,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"add natural history generally) should be investigated and published,"
5402,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"not by the topographical surveyors nor in counties, but by a special"
5403,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"board, and for the whole of Ireland; and they are right, for our"
5404,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"plants, rocks, and animals are not within civil or even obvious"
5405,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"topographical boundaries, and we have plenty of Irishmen qualified to"
5406,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,execute it. They also advise that the statistics should be entrusted to
5407,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"a statistical staff, to be permanently kept up in Ireland. This staff"
5408,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"would take the census every ten years, and would in the intervals"
5409,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,between the beginning and ending of each census have plenty of
5410,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,statistical business to do for parliament (Irish or Imperial) and for
5411,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"public departments. If we are ever to have a registry of births, deaths"
5412,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"(with the circumstances of each case), and marriages, some such staff"
5413,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"will be essential to inspect the registry, and work up information from"
5414,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"it. But the history, antiquities, and industrial resources, the"
5415,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,commissioners recommend to have published in county volumes. They are
5416,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,too solicitous about keeping such volumes to small dimensions; but the
5417,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,rest of their plans are admirable.
5418,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,
5419,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"The value of this to Ireland, whether she be a nation or a province,"
5420,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"cannot be overrated. From the farmer and mechanic to the philosopher,"
5421,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"general, and statesman, the benefit will extend, and yet so careless or"
5422,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"so hostile are ministers that they have not conceded it, and so feeble"
5423,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,"by dulness or disunion are Irishmen and Irish members, that they cannot"
5424,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,extort even this.
5425,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,
5426,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,We now come to the last branch of the subject--
5427,THE VALUATION OF IRELAND.,
5428,THE VALUATION.,THE VALUATION.
5429,THE VALUATION.,
5430,THE VALUATION.,The Committee of 1824 recommended only principles of Valuation. They
5431,THE VALUATION.,"were three, viz.:--"
5432,THE VALUATION.,
5433,THE VALUATION.,"""§ 1. A fixed and uniform principle of valuation applicable"
5434,THE VALUATION.,"throughout the whole work, and enabling the valuation not only of"
5435,THE VALUATION.,"townlands, but that of counties to be compared by one common"
5436,THE VALUATION.,"measure. § 2. A central authority, under the appointment of"
5437,THE VALUATION.,"government, for direction and superintendence, and for the"
5438,THE VALUATION.,generalisation of the returns made in detail. § 3. Local
5439,THE VALUATION.,"assistance, regularly organised, furnishing information on the"
5440,THE VALUATION.,"spot, and forming a check for the protection of private rights."""
5441,THE VALUATION.,
5442,THE VALUATION.,"Accordingly, on the 5th of July, 1825, an Act was passed requiring, in"
5443,THE VALUATION.,"the first instance, the entry in all the grand jury records of the"
5444,THE VALUATION.,"names and contents of all parishes, manors, townlands, and other"
5445,THE VALUATION.,"divisions, and the proportionate assessments. It then went on to"
5446,THE VALUATION.,authorise the Lord Lieutenant to appoint surveyors to be paid out of
5447,THE VALUATION.,the Consolidated Fund. These surveyors were empowered to require the
5448,THE VALUATION.,"attendance of cess collectors and other inhabitants, and with their"
5449,THE VALUATION.,"help to examine, and ascertain, and mark the ""reputed boundaries of all"
5450,THE VALUATION.,"and every or any barony, half barony, townland parish, or other"
5451,THE VALUATION.,"division or denomination of land,"" howsoever called. The Act also"
5452,THE VALUATION.,"inflicted penalties on persons removing or injuring any post, stone, or"
5453,THE VALUATION.,other mark made by the surveyors; but we believe there has been no
5454,THE VALUATION.,"occasion to enforce these clauses, the good sense and good feeling of"
5455,THE VALUATION.,the people being ample securities against such wanton crime. Such
5456,THE VALUATION.,survey was not to affect the rights of owners; yet from it lay an
5457,THE VALUATION.,appeal to the Quarter Sessions.
5458,THE VALUATION.,
5459,THE VALUATION.,"This, as we see, relates to _civil boundaries_, not _valuations_."
5460,THE VALUATION.,
5461,THE VALUATION.,"In May, 1820, another Act was passed directing the Ordnance officers to"
5462,THE VALUATION.,"send copies of their maps, as fast as finished, to the Lord Lieutenant,"
5463,THE VALUATION.,"who was to appoint ""_one_ Commissioner of Valuation for _any_"
5464,THE VALUATION.,"counties""; and to give notice of such appointment to the grand jury of"
5465,THE VALUATION.,every such county. Each grand jury was then to appoint an Appeal
5466,THE VALUATION.,"Committee for each barony, and a Committee of Revision for the whole"
5467,THE VALUATION.,county. This Commission of Valuation was then to appoint from three to
5468,THE VALUATION.,"nine fit valuators in the county, who, after trial by the Commissioner,"
5469,THE VALUATION.,"were to go in parties of three and examine all parts of their district,"
5470,THE VALUATION.,"and value such portion of it, and set down such valuation in a parish"
5471,THE VALUATION.,"field book, according to the following average prices:--"

5655,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"and fighting, and it was more sure of its bellyful of blows than of"
5656,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,bread. It had nothing to sell; why tax its trade? The slight commerce
5657,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,of Dublin was needful to the comforts of the Norman Court in Dublin
5658,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,Castle. Why should _it_ be taxed? The market of Kilkenny was guarded by
5659,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"the spears of the Butlers, and from Sligo to Cork the chiefs and towns"
5660,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"of Munster and Connaught--the Burkes, O'Loghlens, O'Sullivans, Galway,"
5661,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Dingle, and Dunboy--carried on a trade with Spain, and piracy of war"
5662,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,against England. How _could they_ be taxed?
5663,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
5664,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Commercial taxes, too, in those days were hard to be enforced, and more"
5665,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,resembled toll to a robber than contribution to the state. Every great
5666,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"river and pass in Europe, from the Rhine and the Alps to Berwick and"
5667,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"the Blackwater, was affectionately watched by royal and noble castles"
5668,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"at their narrowest points, and the barge anchored and the caravan"
5669,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"halted to be robbed, or, as the receivers called it, to be taxed."
5670,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
5671,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,At last the Pale was stretched round Ireland by art and force. Solitude
5672,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"and peace were in our plains; but the armed colonist settled in it, and"
5673,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"the native came down from his hills as a tenant or a squatter, and a"
5674,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,kind of prosperity arose.
5675,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
5676,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Protestant and Catholic, native and colonist, had the same"
5677,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"interest--namely, to turn this waste into a garden. They had not, nor"
5678,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"could they have had, other things to export than Sydney or Canada have"
5679,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"now--cattle, butter, hides, and wool. They had hardly corn enough for"
5680,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"themselves; but pasture was plenty, and cows and their hides, sheep and"
5681,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"their fleeces, were equally so. The natives had always been obliged to"
5682,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"prepare their own clothing, and therefore every creaght and digger knew"
5683,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"how to dress wool and skins, and they had found out, or preserved from"
5684,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"a more civilised time, dyes which, to this day, are superior to any"
5685,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"others. Small quantities of woollen goods were exported, but our"
5686,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,assertion holds good that in our war-times there was no manufacture for
5687,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,export worth naming.
5688,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
5689,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Black Tom Wentworth, the ablest of despots, came here 210 years ago,"
5690,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"and found ""small beginnings towards a clothing trade."" He at once"
5691,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"resolved to discourage it. He wrote so to the king on July 25th, 1636,"
5692,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"and he was a man true to his enmities. ""But,"" said he, ""I'll give them"
5693,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"a linen manufacture instead."" Now, the Irish had raised flax and made"
5694,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,and dyed linen from time immemorial. The saffron-coloured linen shirt
5695,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,was as national as the cloak and birred; so that Strafford rather
5696,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,introduced the linen manufacture among the new settlers than among the
5697,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Irish. Certainly he encouraged it, by sending Irishmen to learn in"
5698,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Brabant, and by bringing French and Flemings to work in Ireland."
5699,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
5700,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Charles the Second, doubtless to punish us for our most unwise loyalty"
5701,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"to him and his father, assented to a series of Acts prohibiting the"
5702,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"export of Irish wool, cattle, etc., to England or her colonies, and"
5703,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,prohibiting the _direct_ importation of several colonial products

5710,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"They plundered our pockets, but they guarded our souls from being"

5713,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
5714,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"England got alarmed, for Ireland was getting rich. The English lords"

5718,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"him, by very strict laws, totally to prohibit and suppress the same."""
5719,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"The Commons said likewise; and William answered comfortably:--""I shall"
5720,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,do all that in me lies to discourage the woollen manufacture in
5721,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Ireland, and to encourage the linen manufacture there, and to promote"
5722,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"the trade of England."""
5723,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
5724,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"He was as good as his word, and even whipped and humbugged the"
5725,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"unfortunate Irish Parliament to pass an Act, putting twenty per cent."

5727,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
5728,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"""But it did not satisfy the English parliament, where a perpetual"

5732,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,commissioners of the revenue; duties had been before laid on the
5733,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"importation into England equal to a prohibition, therefore this Act"
5734,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"has operated as a total prohibition of the exportation."""
5735,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
5736,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,There was nothing left but to send the wool raw to England; to smuggle
5737,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"it and cloths to France and Spain, or to leave the land unstocked. The"
5738,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"first was worst. The export to England declined, smuggling prospered,"
5739,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"""wild geese"" for the Brigade and woollen goods were run in exchange for"
5740,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"claret, brandy, and silks; but not much land was left waste. Our silks,"
5741,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"cottons, malt, beer, and almost every other article was similarly"
5742,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"prohibited. Striped linens were taxed thirty per cent., many other"
5743,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"kinds of linen were also interfered with, and twenty-four embargoes in"
5744,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,nineteen years straitened our foreign provision trade. Thus England
5745,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"kept her pledge of wrath, and broke her promise of service to Ireland."
5746,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
5747,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"A vigorous system of smuggling induced her to relax in some points, and"

5750,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"By the Union we were so drained of money, and absentee rents and taxes,"
5751,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"and of spirit in every way, that she no longer needs a prohibitory code"
5752,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"to prevent our competing with her in any market, Irish or foreign. The"
5753,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Union is prohibition enough, and that England says she will maintain."

5755,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Whether it be now possible to create home manufactures, in the old"
5756,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"sense of the word--that is, manufactures made in the homes of the"

5758,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
5759,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"In favour of such a thing, if it be possible, the arguments are"
5760,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,numberless. Such work is a source of ingenuity and enjoyment in the
5761,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,cabin of the peasant; it rather fills up time that would be otherwise
5762,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,idled than takes from other work. Our peasants' wives and daughters
5763,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"could clothe themselves and their families by the winter night work,"
5764,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"even as those of Norway do, if the peasants possessed the little"
5765,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,estates that Norway's peasants do. Clothes manufactured by hand-work
5766,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"are more lasting, comfortable, and handsome, and are more natural and"
5767,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"national than factory goods. Besides, there is the strongest of all"
5768,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"reasons in this, that the factory system seems everywhere a poison to"
5769,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,virtue and happiness.
5770,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
5771,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Some invention, which should bring the might of machinery in a"

5773,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,difficulty.
5774,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
5775,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"The hazards of the factory system, however, should be encountered, were"
5776,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,it sure to feed our starving millions; but this is dubious.
5777,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
5778,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,A Native Parliament can alone judge or act usefully on this momentous
5779,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"subject. An absentee tax and a resident government, and the progress of"
5780,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"public industry and education, would enable an Irish Parliament to"
5781,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,create vast manufactures here by protecting duties in the first
5782,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"instance, and to maintain them by our general prosperity, or it could"
5783,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,rely on its own adjustment of landed property as sufficient to put the

5785,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,great manufactures.
5786,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
5787,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"A peasant proprietary could have wealth enough to import wrought goods,"
5788,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,or taste and firmness enough to prefer home-made manufactures.

5790,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,But these are questions for other years. We wish the reader to take our

5796,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,in the _Citizen_.
5797,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
5798,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Do not be alarmed at the list, reader; a month's study would carry you"
5799,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"through all but the Reports, and it would be well spent. But if you"
5800,COMMERCIAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"still shrink, you can ease your conscience by reading Mr. John"

5809,NATIONAL ART.,
5810,NATIONAL ART.,No one doubts that if he sees a place or an action he knows more of it
5811,NATIONAL ART.,"than if it had been described to him by a witness. The dullest man, who"
5812,NATIONAL ART.,"""put on his best attire"" to welcome Cæsar, had a better notion of life"
5813,NATIONAL ART.,in Rome than our ablest artist or antiquary.
5814,NATIONAL ART.,
5815,NATIONAL ART.,"Were painting, then, but a coloured chronicle, telling us facts by the"
5816,NATIONAL ART.,"eye instead of the ear, it would demand the Statesman's care and the"
5817,NATIONAL ART.,"People's love. It would preserve for us faces we worshipped, and the"
5818,NATIONAL ART.,"forms of men who led and instructed us. It would remind us, and teach"
5819,NATIONAL ART.,"our children, not only how these men looked, but, to some extent, what"
5820,NATIONAL ART.,"they were, for nature is consistent, and she has indexed her labours."
5821,NATIONAL ART.,"It would carry down a pictorial history of our houses, arts, costume,"
5822,NATIONAL ART.,"and manners to other times, and show the dweller in a remote isle the"
5823,NATIONAL ART.,appearance of countries and races of his cotemporaries.
5824,NATIONAL ART.,
5825,NATIONAL ART.,"As a register of _facts--as a portrayer of men, singly, or"
5826,NATIONAL ART.,"assembled--and as a depicter of actual scenery, art is biography,"
5827,NATIONAL ART.,"history, and topography taught through the eye."
5828,NATIONAL ART.,
5829,NATIONAL ART.,"So far as it can express facts, it is superior to writing; and nothing"
5830,NATIONAL ART.,"but the scarcity of _faithful_ artists, or the stupidity of the"
5831,NATIONAL ART.,"public, prevents us from having our pictorial libraries of men and"
5832,NATIONAL ART.,places. There are some classes of scenes--as where continuous action is
5833,NATIONAL ART.,"to be expressed--in which sculpture quite fails, and painting is but a"
5834,NATIONAL ART.,shadowy narrator.
5835,NATIONAL ART.,
5836,NATIONAL ART.,"But this, after all, though the most obvious and easy use of Painting"
5837,NATIONAL ART.,"and Sculpture, is far indeed from being their highest end."
5838,NATIONAL ART.,
5839,NATIONAL ART.,"Art is a regenerator as well as a copyist. As the historian, who"
5840,NATIONAL ART.,"composes a history out of various materials, differs from a newspaper"
5841,NATIONAL ART.,"reporter, who sets down what he sees--as Plutarch differs from Mr."
5842,NATIONAL ART.,"Grant, and the Abbé Barthelemy from the last traveller in India--so do"
5843,NATIONAL ART.,"the Historical Painter, the Landscape composer (such as Claude or"
5844,NATIONAL ART.,"Poussin) differ from the most faithful Portrait, Landscape, or Scene"
5845,NATIONAL ART.,Drawer.
5846,NATIONAL ART.,
5847,NATIONAL ART.,The Painter who is a master of composition makes his pencil cotemporary
5848,NATIONAL ART.,"with all times and ubiquitous. Keeping strictly to nature and fact,"
5849,NATIONAL ART.,"Romulus sits for him and Paul preaches. He makes Attila charge, and"
5850,NATIONAL ART.,"Mohammed exhort, and Ephesus blaze when he likes. He tries not rashly,"
5851,NATIONAL ART.,"but by years of study of men's character, and dress, and deeds, to make"
5852,NATIONAL ART.,them and their acts come as in a vision before him. Having thus got a
5853,NATIONAL ART.,"design, he attempts to realise the vision on his canvas. He pays the"
5854,NATIONAL ART.,"most minute attention to truth in his drawing, shading, and colouring,"
5855,NATIONAL ART.,"and by imitating the force of nature in his composition, all the clouds"
5856,NATIONAL ART.,"that ever floated by him, ""the lights of other days,"" and the forms of"
5857,NATIONAL ART.,"the dead, or the stranger, hover over him."
5858,NATIONAL ART.,
5859,NATIONAL ART.,But Art in its higher stage is more than this. It is a creator. Great
5860,NATIONAL ART.,"as Herodotus and Thierry are, Homer and Beranger are greater. The ideal"
5861,NATIONAL ART.,"has resources beyond the actual. It is infinite, and Art is"
5862,NATIONAL ART.,"indefinitely powerful. The Apollo is more than noble, and the Hercules"
5863,NATIONAL ART.,mightier than man. The Moses of Michael Angelo is no likeness of the
5864,NATIONAL ART.,"inspired law-giver, nor of any other that ever lived, and Raphael's"
5865,NATIONAL ART.,"Madonnas are not the faces of women. As Reynolds says, ""the effect of"
5866,NATIONAL ART.,the capital works of Michael Angelo is that the observer feels his
5867,NATIONAL ART.,"whole frame enlarged."" It is creation, it is representing beings and"
5868,NATIONAL ART.,"things different from our nature, but true to their own. In this"
5869,NATIONAL ART.,self-consistency is the only nature requisite in works purely
5870,NATIONAL ART.,"imaginative. Lear is true to his nature, and so are Mephistopheles, and"
5871,NATIONAL ART.,"Prometheus, and Achilles; but they are not true to human nature; they"
5872,NATIONAL ART.,"are beings created by the poets' minds, and true to _their_ laws"
5873,NATIONAL ART.,"of being. There is no commoner blunder in men, who are themselves mere"
5874,NATIONAL ART.,"critics, never creators, than to require consistency to the nature of"
5875,NATIONAL ART.,us and our world in the works of poet or painter.
5876,NATIONAL ART.,
5877,NATIONAL ART.,"To create a mass of great pictures, statues, and buildings is of the"
5878,NATIONAL ART.,same sort of ennoblement to a people as to create great poems or
5879,NATIONAL ART.,"histories, or make great codes, or win great battles. The next best,"
5880,NATIONAL ART.,"though far inferior, blessing and power is to inherit such works and"
5881,NATIONAL ART.,achievements. The lowest stage of all is neither to possess nor to
5882,NATIONAL ART.,create them.
5883,NATIONAL ART.,
5884,NATIONAL ART.,"Ireland has had some great Painters--Barry and Forde, for example, and"
5885,NATIONAL ART.,many of inferior but great excellence; and now she boasts high
5886,NATIONAL ART.,"names--Maclise, Hogan, and Mulready. But their works were seldom done"
5887,NATIONAL ART.,"for Ireland, and are rarely known in it. Our portrait and landscape"
5888,NATIONAL ART.,"Painters paint foreign men and scenes; and, at all events, the Irish"
5889,NATIONAL ART.,"people do not see, possess, nor receive knowledge from their works."
5890,NATIONAL ART.,Irish history has supplied no subjects for our greatest Artists; and
5891,NATIONAL ART.,"though, as we repeat, Ireland possessed a Forde and Barry, creative"
5892,NATIONAL ART.,"Painters of the highest order, the pictures of the latter are mostly"
5893,NATIONAL ART.,abroad; those of the former unseen and unknown. Alas! that they are so
5894,NATIONAL ART.,few.
5895,NATIONAL ART.,
5896,NATIONAL ART.,"To collect into, and make known, and publish in Ireland the best works"
5897,NATIONAL ART.,of our living and dead Artists is one of the steps towards procuring
5898,NATIONAL ART.,for Ireland a recognised National Art. And this is essential to our
5899,NATIONAL ART.,civilisation and renown. The other is by giving education to students
5900,NATIONAL ART.,"and rewards to Artists, to make many of this generation true"
5901,NATIONAL ART.,"representers, some of them great illustrators and composers, and,"
5902,NATIONAL ART.,"perchance, to facilitate the creation of some great spirit."
5903,NATIONAL ART.,
5904,NATIONAL ART.,Something has been done--more remains.
5905,NATIONAL ART.,
5906,NATIONAL ART.,There are schools in Dublin and Cork. But why are those so neglected
5907,NATIONAL ART.,and imperfect? and why are not similar or better institutions in
5908,NATIONAL ART.,"Belfast, Derry, Galway, Waterford, and Kilkenny? Why is there not a"
5909,NATIONAL ART.,"decent collection of casts anywhere but in Cork, and why are they in a"
5910,NATIONAL ART.,"garret there? And why have we no gallery of Irishmen's, or any other"
5911,NATIONAL ART.,"men's, pictures in Ireland?"
5912,NATIONAL ART.,
5913,NATIONAL ART.,The Art Union has done a great deal. It has helped to support in
5914,NATIONAL ART.,Ireland artists who should otherwise have starved or emigrated; it has
5915,NATIONAL ART.,"dispersed one (when, oh when, will it disperse another?) fine print of"
5916,NATIONAL ART.,"a fine Irish picture through the country, and to some extent interested"
5917,NATIONAL ART.,"as well as instructed thousands. Yet it could, and we believe will, do"
5918,NATIONAL ART.,much more. It ought to have Corresponding Committees in the principal
5919,NATIONAL ART.,"towns to preserve and rub up old schools of art and foster new ones,"
5920,NATIONAL ART.,"and it might by art and historical libraries, and by other ways, help"
5921,NATIONAL ART.,"the cause. We speak as friends, and suggest not as critics, for it has"
5922,NATIONAL ART.,done good service.
5923,NATIONAL ART.,
5924,NATIONAL ART.,"The Repeal Association, too, in offering prizes for pictures and"
5925,NATIONAL ART.,"sculptures of Irish historical subjects, has taken its proper place as"
5926,NATIONAL ART.,the patron of nationality in art; and its rewards for Building Designs
5927,NATIONAL ART.,"may promote the comfort and taste of the people, and the reputation of"
5928,NATIONAL ART.,"the country. If artists will examine the rules by which the pictures,"
5929,NATIONAL ART.,"statues, and plates remain their property, they will find the prizes"
5930,NATIONAL ART.,"not so small as they might at first appear. Nor should they, from"
5931,NATIONAL ART.,"interest or just pride, be indifferent to the popularity and fame of"
5932,NATIONAL ART.,"success on national subjects, and with a People's Prizes to be"
5933,NATIONAL ART.,contended for. If those who are not Repealers will treat the
5934,NATIONAL ART.,"Association's design kindly and candidly, and if the Repealers will act"
5935,NATIONAL ART.,"in art upon principles of justice and conciliation, we shall not only"
5936,NATIONAL ART.,"advance national art, but gain another field of common exertion."
5937,NATIONAL ART.,
5938,NATIONAL ART.,The Cork School of Art owes its existence to many causes.
5939,NATIONAL ART.,
5940,NATIONAL ART.,"The intense, genial, and Irish character of the people, the southern"
5941,NATIONAL ART.,"warmth and variety of clime, with its effects on animal and vegetable"
5942,NATIONAL ART.,"beings, are the natural causes."
5943,NATIONAL ART.,
5944,NATIONAL ART.,"The accident of Barry's birth there, and his great fame, excited the"
5945,NATIONAL ART.,ambition of the young artists. An Irishman and a Corkman had gone out
5946,NATIONAL ART.,"from them, and amazed men by the grandeur and originality of his works"
5947,NATIONAL ART.,of art. He had thrown the whole of the English painters into
5948,NATIONAL ART.,"insignificance, for who would compare the luscious commonplace of the"
5949,NATIONAL ART.,"Stuart painters, or the melodramatic reality of Hogarth, or the"
5950,NATIONAL ART.,"imitative beauty of Reynolds, or the clumsy strength of West, with the"
5951,NATIONAL ART.,overbearing grandeur of his works?
5952,NATIONAL ART.,
5953,NATIONAL ART.,"But the _present_ glories of Cork, Maclise and Hogan, the greater,"
5954,NATIONAL ART.,"but buried might of Forde, and the rich promise which we know is"
5955,NATIONAL ART.,"springing there now, are mainly owing to another cause; and that is,"
5956,NATIONAL ART.,that Cork possesses a gallery of the finest casts in the world.
5957,NATIONAL ART.,
5958,NATIONAL ART.,"These casts are not very many--117 only; but they are perfect, they are"
5959,NATIONAL ART.,"the first from Canova's moulds, and embrace the greatest works of Greek"
5960,NATIONAL ART.,art. They are ill-placed in a dim and dirty room--more shame to the
5961,NATIONAL ART.,"rich men of Cork for leaving them so--but there they are, and there"
5962,NATIONAL ART.,"studied Forde, and Maclise, and the rest, until they learned to draw"
5963,NATIONAL ART.,"better than any moderns, except Cornelius and his living brethren."
5964,NATIONAL ART.,
5965,NATIONAL ART.,In the countries where art is permanent there are great
5966,NATIONAL ART.,"collections--Tuscany and Rome, for example. But, as we have said"
5967,NATIONAL ART.,"before, the highest service done by success in art is not in the"
5968,NATIONAL ART.,"possession but in the creation of great works, the spirit, labour,"
5969,NATIONAL ART.,"sagacity, and instruction needed by the artists to succeed, and flung"
5970,NATIONAL ART.,out by them on their country like rain from sunny clouds.
5971,NATIONAL ART.,
5972,NATIONAL ART.,"Indeed, there is some danger of a traditionary mediocrity following"
5973,NATIONAL ART.,"after a great epoch in art. Superstition of style, technical rules in"
5974,NATIONAL ART.,"composition, and all the pedantry of art, too often fill up the ranks"
5975,NATIONAL ART.,"vacated by veteran genius, and of this there are examples enough in"
5976,NATIONAL ART.,"Flanders, Spain, and even Italy. The schools may, and often do, make"
5977,NATIONAL ART.,"men scholastic and ungenial, and art remains an instructor and refiner,"
5978,NATIONAL ART.,but creates no more.
5979,NATIONAL ART.,
5980,NATIONAL ART.,"Ireland, fortunately or unfortunately, has everything to do yet. We"
5981,NATIONAL ART.,have had great artists--we have not their works--we own the nativity of
5982,NATIONAL ART.,great living artists--they live on the Tiber and the Thames. Our
5983,NATIONAL ART.,capital has no school of art--no facilities for acquiring it.
5984,NATIONAL ART.,
5985,NATIONAL ART.,"To be sure, there are rooms open in the Dublin Society, and they have"
5986,NATIONAL ART.,"not been useless, that is all. But a student here cannot learn anatomy,"
5987,NATIONAL ART.,save at the same expense as a surgical student. He has no great works
5988,NATIONAL ART.,"of art before him, no Pantheon, no Valhalla, not even a good museum or"
5989,NATIONAL ART.,gallery.
5990,NATIONAL ART.,
5991,NATIONAL ART.,We think it may be laid down as unalterably true that a student should
5992,NATIONAL ART.,never draw from a flat surface. He learns nothing by drawing from the
5993,NATIONAL ART.,lines of another man--he only mimics. Better for him to draw chairs and
5994,NATIONAL ART.,"tables, bottles and glasses, rubbish, potatoes, cabins, or kitchen"
5995,NATIONAL ART.,"utensils, than draw from the lines laid down by other men."
5996,NATIONAL ART.,
5997,NATIONAL ART.,Of those forms of nature which the student can originally consult--the
5998,NATIONAL ART.,"sea, the sky, the earth--we would counsel him to draw from them in the"
5999,NATIONAL ART.,first learning; for though he ought afterwards to analyse and mature
6000,NATIONAL ART.,"his style by the study of works of art, from the first sketches to the"
6001,NATIONAL ART.,"finished picture, yet, by beginning with nature and his own"
6002,NATIONAL ART.,"suggestions, he will acquire a genuine and original style, superior to"
6003,NATIONAL ART.,the finest imitation; and it is hard to acquire a master's skill
6004,NATIONAL ART.,without his manner.
6005,NATIONAL ART.,
6006,NATIONAL ART.,Were all men cast in a divine mould of strength and straightness and
6007,NATIONAL ART.,"gallant bearing, and all women proportioned, graceful, and fair, the"
6008,NATIONAL ART.,"artist would need no gallery, at least to begin his studies with. He"
6009,NATIONAL ART.,"would have to persuade or snatch his models in daily life. Even then,"
6010,NATIONAL ART.,as art creates greater and simpler combinations than ever exist in
6011,NATIONAL ART.,"fact, he should finally study before the superhuman works of his"
6012,NATIONAL ART.,predecessors.
6013,NATIONAL ART.,
6014,NATIONAL ART.,"But he has about him here an indifferently-made, ordinary, not very"
6015,NATIONAL ART.,"clean, nor picturesquely-clad people; though, doubtless, if they had"
6016,NATIONAL ART.,"the feeding, the dress, and the education (for mind beautifies the"
6017,NATIONAL ART.,"body) of the Greeks, they would not be inferior, for the Irish"
6018,NATIONAL ART.,structure is of the noblest order.
6019,NATIONAL ART.,
6020,NATIONAL ART.,"To give him a multitude of fine natural models, to say nothing of ideal"
6021,NATIONAL ART.,"works, it is necessary to make a gallery of statues or casts. The"
6022,NATIONAL ART.,"statues will come in good time, and we hope, and are sure, that"
6023,NATIONAL ART.,"Ireland, a nation, will have a national gallery, combining the greatest"
6024,NATIONAL ART.,works of the Celtic and Teutonic races. But at present the most that
6025,NATIONAL ART.,can be done is to form a gallery.
6026,NATIONAL ART.,
6027,NATIONAL ART.,Our readers will be glad to hear that this great boon is about to be
6028,NATIONAL ART.,given to Irish Art. A society for the formation of a gallery of casts
6029,NATIONAL ART.,in Dublin has been founded.
6030,NATIONAL ART.,
6031,NATIONAL ART.,"It embraces men of every rank, class, creed, politics, and calling,"
6032,NATIONAL ART.,"thus forming another of those sanctuaries, now multiplying in Ireland,"
6033,NATIONAL ART.,where one is safe from the polemic and the partisan.
6034,NATIONAL ART.,
6035,NATIONAL ART.,"Its purpose is to purchase casts of all the greatest works of Greece,"
6036,NATIONAL ART.,"Egypt, Etruria, ancient Rome, and Europe in the middle ages. This will"
6037,NATIONAL ART.,"embrace a sufficient variety of types, both natural and ideal, to"
6038,NATIONAL ART.,"prevent imitation, and will avoid the debateable ground of modern art."
6039,NATIONAL ART.,"Wherever they can afford it the society will buy moulds, in order to"
6040,NATIONAL ART.,"assist provincial galleries, and therefore the provinces are"
6041,NATIONAL ART.,immediately interested in its support.
6042,NATIONAL ART.,
6043,NATIONAL ART.,"When a few of these casts are got together, and a proper gallery"
6044,NATIONAL ART.,"procured, the public will be admitted to see, and artists to study,"
6045,NATIONAL ART.,"them without any charge. The annual subscription is but ten shillings,"
6046,NATIONAL ART.,the object being to interest as many as possible in its support.
6047,NATIONAL ART.,
6048,NATIONAL ART.,It has been suggested to us by an artist that Trinity College ought to
6049,NATIONAL ART.,establish a gallery and museum containing casts of all the ancient
6050,NATIONAL ART.,"statues, models of their buildings, civil and military, and a"
6051,NATIONAL ART.,"collection of their implements of art, trade, and domestic life. A"
6052,NATIONAL ART.,"nobler institution, a more vivid and productive commentary on the"
6053,NATIONAL ART.,"classics, could not be. But if the Board will not do this of"
6054,NATIONAL ART.,"themselves, we trust they will see the propriety of assisting this"
6055,NATIONAL ART.,"public gallery, and procuring, therefore, special privileges for the"
6056,NATIONAL ART.,students in using it.
6057,NATIONAL ART.,
6058,NATIONAL ART.,"But no matter what persons in authority may do or neglect, we trust the"
6059,NATIONAL ART.,"public--for the sake of their own pleasure, their children's profit,"
6060,NATIONAL ART.,and Ireland's honour--will give it their instant and full support.

6253,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,orders you are credentials of greatness which all men understand and
6254,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,acknowledge. Such a man's dictum has more influence than the reasoning
6255,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,of an imitative or commonplace man. He fills his circle with
6256,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"confidence. He is self-possessed, firm, accurate, and daring. Such men"

6333,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"Celtic Scots, who came back here from the thirteenth to the seventeenth"
6334,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"centuries, and the Celtic Welsh, who colonised many parts of Wexford"
6335,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"and other Leinster counties, to the Celts who never left Ireland,"
6336,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"probably five-sixths, or more, of us are Celts. What business have we"
6337,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,with the Norman-Sassenagh?
6338,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,
6339,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,Nor let any doubt these proportions because of the number of English
6340,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,_names_ in Ireland. With a politic cruelty the English of the Pale
6341,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"passed an Act (3 Edw. IV., c. 3) compelling every Irishman within"
6342,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"English jurisdiction ""to go like to one Englishman in apparel, and"
6343,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"shaving off his beard above the mouth,"" ""and shall take to him an"
6344,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"English sirname of one town, as Sutton, Chester, Trym, Skryne, Corke,"
6345,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"Kinsale; or colour, as White, Blacke, Browne; or art or science, as"
6346,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"Smith or Carpenter; or office, as Cook, Butler; and that he and his"
6347,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"issue shall use this name, under pain of forfeiting his goods yearly."""
6348,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,
6349,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"And just as this Parliament before the Reformation, so did another"
6350,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"after the Reformation. By the 28th Henry VIII., c. 15, the dress and"
6351,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,language of the Irish were insolently described as barbarous by the
6352,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"minions of that ruffian king, and were utterly forbidden and abolished"
6353,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,under many penalties and incapacities. These laws are still in force;
6354,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"but whether the Archæological Society, including Peel and O'Connell,"
6355,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,will be prosecuted seems doubtful.
6356,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,
6357,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"There was, also, 'tis to be feared, an adoption of English names,"
6358,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"during some periods, from fashion, fear, or meanness. Some of our best"
6359,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"Irish names, too, have been so mangled as to require some scholarship"
6360,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,to identify them. For these and many more reasons the members of the
6361,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,Celtic race here are immensely greater than at first appears.
6362,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,
6363,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"But this is not all; for even the Saxon and Norman colonists,"
6364,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"notwithstanding these laws, melted down into the Irish, and adopted all"
6365,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,their ways and language. For centuries upon centuries Irish was spoken
6366,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"by men of all bloods in Ireland, and English was unknown, save to a few"
6367,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,citizens and nobles of the Pale. 'Tis only within a very late period
6368,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,that the majority of the people learned English.
6369,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,
6370,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"But, it will be asked, how can the language be restored now?"
6371,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,
6372,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"We shall answer this partly by saying that, through the labours of the"
6373,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"Archæological and many lesser societies, it _is_ being revived rapidly."
6374,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,
6375,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,We shall consider this question of the possibility of reviving it more
6376,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,at length some other day.
6377,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,
6378,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,Nothing can make us believe that it is natural or honourable for the
6379,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"Irish to speak the speech of the alien, the invader, the Sassenagh"
6380,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"tyrant, and to abandon the language of our kings and heroes. What! give"
6381,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"up the tongue of Ollamh Fodhla and Brian Boru, the tongue of M'Carty,"
6382,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"and the O'Nials, the tongue of Sarsfield's, Curran's, Mathew's, and"
6383,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"O'Connell's boyhood, for that of Strafford and Poynings, Sussex, Kirk,"
6384,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,and Cromwell!
6385,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,
6386,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"No! oh, no! the ""brighter days shall surely come,"" and the green flag"
6387,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"shall wave on our towers, and the sweet old language be heard once more"
6388,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"in college, mart, and senate."
6389,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,
6390,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"But even should the effort to save it as the national language fail, by"
6391,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"the attempt we will rescue its old literature, and hand down to our"
6392,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"descendants proofs that we had a language as fit for love, and war, and"
6393,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"business, and pleasure, as the world ever knew, and that we had not the"
6394,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,spirit and nationality to preserve it!
6395,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,
6396,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,Had Swift known Irish he would have sowed its seed by the side of that
6397,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"nationality which he planted, and the close of the last century would"
6398,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,have seen the one as flourishing as the other. Had Ireland used Irish
6399,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"in 1782, would it not have impeded England's re-conquest of us? But"
6400,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,'tis not yet too late.
6401,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,
6402,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"For _you_, if the mixed speech called English was laid with"
6403,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"sweetmeats on your child's tongue, English is the best speech of"
6404,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"manhood. And yet, rather, in that case you are unfortunate. The hills,"
6405,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"and lakes, and rivers, the forts and castles, the churches and"
6406,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"parishes, the baronies and counties around you, have all Irish"
6407,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"names--names which describe the nature of the scenery or ground, the"
6408,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"name of founder, or chief, or priest, or the leading fact in the"
6409,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"history of the place. To you these are names hard to pronounce, and"
6410,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,without meaning.
6411,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,
6412,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,And yet it were well for you to know them. That knowledge would be a
6413,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"topography, and a history, and romance, walking by your side, and"
6414,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"helping your discourse. Meath tells it flatness, Clonmel the abundant"
6415,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"riches of its valley, Fermanagh is the land of the Lakes, Tyrone the"
6416,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"country of Owen, Kilkenny the Church of St. Canice, Dunmore the great"
6417,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"fort, Athenry the Ford of the Kings, Dunleary the Fort of O'Leary; and"
6418,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"the Phoenix Park, instead of taking its name from a fable, recognises"
6419,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"as christener the ""sweet water"" which yet springs near the east gate.[43]"
6420,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,
6421,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"All the names of our airs and songs are Irish, and we every day are as"
6422,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"puzzled and ingeniously wrong about them as the man who, when asked for"
6423,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"the air, ""I am asleep, and don't waken me,"" called it ""Tommy M'Cullagh"
6424,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"made boots for me."""
6425,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,
6426,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"The bulk of our history and poetry are written in Irish, and shall we,"
6427,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"who learn Italian, and Latin, and Greek, to read Dante, Livy, and Homer"
6428,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,in the original--shall we be content with ignorance or a translation of
6429,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,Irish?
6430,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,
6431,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"The want of modern scientific words in Irish is undeniable, and"
6432,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,doubtless we should adopt the existing names into our language. The
6433,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"Germans have done the same thing, and no one calls German mongrel on"
6434,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,that account. Most of these names are clumsy and extravagant; and are
6435,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"almost all derived from Greek or Latin, and cut as foreign a figure in"
6436,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,French and English as they would in Irish. Once Irish was recognised as
6437,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"a language to be learned as much as French or Italian, our dictionaries"
6438,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"would fill up and our vocabularies ramify, to suit all the wants of"
6439,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,life and conversation.
6440,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,
6441,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"These objections are ingenious refinements, however, rarely thought of"
6442,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,till after the other and great objection has been answered.
6443,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,
6444,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"The usual objection to attempting the revival of Irish is, that it"
6445,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,could not succeed.
6446,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,
6447,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"If an attempt were made to introduce Irish, either through the national"
6448,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"schools, or the courts of law, into the eastern side of the island, it"
6449,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"would certainly fail, and the reaction might extinguish it altogether."
6450,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,But no one contemplates this save as a dream of what may happen a
6451,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"hundred years hence. It is quite another thing to say, as we do, that"
6452,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"the Irish language should be cherished, taught, and esteemed, and that"
6453,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,it can be preserved and gradually extended.
6454,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,
6455,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"What we seek is, that the people of the upper classes should have their"
6456,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,children taught the language which explains our names of persons or
6457,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"places, our older history, and our music, and which is spoken in the"
6458,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"majority of our counties, rather than Italian, German, or French. It"
6459,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"would be more useful in life, more serviceable to the taste and genius"
6460,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"of young people, and a more flexible accomplishment for an Irish man or"
6461,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"woman to speak, sign, and write Irish than French."
6462,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,
6463,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,At present the middle classes think it a sign of vulgarity to speak
6464,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"Irish--the children are everywhere taught English, and English alone in"
6465,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"schools--and, what is worse, they are urged by rewards and punishments"
6466,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"to speak it at home, for English is the language of their masters. Now,"
6467,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,we think the example and exertions of the upper classes would be
6468,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,sufficient to set the opposite and better fashion of preferring Irish;
6469,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"and, even as a matter of taste, we think them bound to do so. And we"
6470,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"ask it of the pride, the patriotism, and the hearts of our farmers and"
6471,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"shopkeepers, will they try to drive out of their children's minds the"
6472,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"native language of almost every great man we had, from Brian Boru to"
6473,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,O'Connell--will they meanly sacrifice the language which names their
6474,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"hills, and towns, and music, to the tongue of the stranger?"
6475,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,
6476,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,About half the people west of a line drawn from Derry to Waterford
6477,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"speak Irish habitually, and in some of the mountain tracts east of that"
6478,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,line it is still common. Simply requiring the teachers of the national
6479,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"schools in these Irish-speaking districts to know Irish, and supplying"
6480,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"them with Irish translations of the school books, would guard the"
6481,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"language where it now exists, and prevent it from being swept away by"
6482,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"the English tongue, as the Red Americans have been by the English race"
6483,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,from New York to New Orleans.
6484,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,
6485,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,The example of the upper classes would extend and develop a modern
6486,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"Irish literature, and the hearty support they have given to the"
6487,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,Archæological Society makes us hope that they will have sense and
6488,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,spirit to do so.
6489,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,
6490,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,But the establishment of a newspaper partly or wholly Irish would be
6491,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,the most rapid and sure way of serving the language. The Irish-speaking
6492,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"man would find, in his native tongue, the political news and general"
6493,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,information he has now to seek in English; and the English-speaking
6494,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"man, having Irish frequently before him in so attractive a form, would"
6495,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"be tempted to learn its characters, and, by-and-by, its meaning."
6496,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,
6497,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,These newspapers in many languages are now to be found everywhere but
6498,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"here. In South America many of these papers are Spanish and English, or"
6499,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"French; in North America, French and English; in Northern Italy, German"
6500,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"and Italian; in Denmark and Holland, German is used in addition to the"
6501,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"native tongue; in Alsace and Switzerland, French and German; in Poland,"
6502,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"German, French, and Sclavonic; in Turkey, French and Turkish; in"
6503,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"Hungary, Magyar, Sclavonic, and German; and the little Canton of Grison"
6504,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"uses three languages in its press. With the exception of Hungary, the"
6505,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"secondary language is, in all cases, spoken by fewer persons than the"
6506,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"Irish-speaking people of Ireland, and while they everywhere tolerate"
6507,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"and use one language as a medium of commerce, they cherish the other as"
6508,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,"the vehicle of history, the wings of song, the soil of their genius,"
6509,OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.,and a mark and guard of nationality.

6520,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,
6521,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,
6522,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,"Judged by the _Directory_, Dublin is nobly supplied with institutions"
6523,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,"for the promotion of Literature, Science, and Art; and, judged by its"
6524,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,"men, there is mind enough here to make these institutions prosper, and"
6525,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,instruct and raise the country. Yet their performances are far short of
6526,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,"these promises, and the causes for ill-success are easily found. We"
6527,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,believe these causes could be almost as easily removed.
6528,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,
6529,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,"In the first place, we have too many of these institutions. Stingy"
6530,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,grants from Government and the general poverty of the people render
6531,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,economy a matter of the first consequence; yet we find these societies
6532,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,"maintaining a number of separate establishments, at a great expense of"
6533,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,rent and salaries.
6534,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,
6535,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,"The consequence, of course, is that none of them flourish as they"
6536,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,"ought--museums, meetings, lectures, libraries, and exhibitions are all"
6537,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,"frittered away, and nothing is done so well as it might be. Moreover,"
6538,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,"from the want of any arrangement and order, the same men are dragged"
6539,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,"from one society to another--few men do much, because all are forced to"
6540,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,attempt so many things.
6541,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,
6542,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,"But 'tis better to examine this in detail, and in doing so we may as"
6543,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,"well give some leading facts as to the chief of these bodies. Take, for"
6544,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,"example, as a beginning, the"
6545,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,
6546,INSTITUTIONS OF DUBLIN.,
6547,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.
6548,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,
6549,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"And first there is the Hibernian Academy. It was founded in 1823,"
6550,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"received a present of its house in Abbey Street, and some books and"
6551,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"casts, from Francis Johnston, a Dublin architect, and has the miserable"
6552,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"income of £300 a year from the Treasury. It has a drawing-school, with"
6553,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"a few casts, no pictures, bad accommodation, and professors whose pay"
6554,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,is nearly nominal.
6555,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,
6556,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"It undoubtedly has some men of great ability and attainments, and some"
6557,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"who have neither; but what can be done without funds, statues, or"
6558,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"pictures? To aggravate its difficulties, the Dublin Society has another"
6559,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"art school, still worse off as to casts, and equally deficient in"
6560,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,pictures. As a place of instruction in the designing of patterns for
6561,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"manufactures and the like, the Dublin Society school has worked well;"
6562,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,and many of the best-paid controllers of design in the English
6563,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,manufactories were educated there; but as a school of fine arts it does
6564,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,little; and no wonder. Another branch of the Hibernian Academy's
6565,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,operations is its annual exhibition of pictures. These exhibitions
6566,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"attract crowds who would never otherwise see a painting, promote"
6567,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"thought on art, and procure patronage for artists. In this, too, the"
6568,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,Hibernian Academy has recently found a rival in the Society of Irish
6569,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"Artists, established in 1842, which has an annual exhibition in College"
6570,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"Street, and pays the expenses of the exhibition out of the admission"
6571,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"fees, as does the Hibernian Academy. We are not attaching blame to the"
6572,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,Society of Irish Artists in noticing the fact of its rivalry.
6573,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,
6574,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,There are three other bodies devoted to the encouragement of art. One
6575,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"of these is the Art Union, founded in 1840, and maintained entirely by"
6576,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,subscriptions to its lottery. It distributes fine engravings from Irish
6577,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"pictures among all its members, and pictures and statues, bought in the"
6578,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"exhibitions of the Hibernian Academy, and of the Society of Irish"
6579,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"Artists, among its prize-holders; and it gives premiums for the works"
6580,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,of native or resident artists. Its operation is as a patron of art;
6581,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"and, in order to get funds for this purpose, and also to secure"
6582,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"superior works and a higher competition, it extends its purchases to"
6583,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"the best foreign works exhibited here. It has no collection, and has"
6584,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"merely an office in College Street--in fact, its best permanent"
6585,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,possession is its unwearied secretary. The Society of Ancient Art was
6586,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,established last year for the formation of a public gallery of casts
6587,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"from classical and mediæval statues, and ultimately for purposes of"
6588,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"direct teaching by lectures, etc. It obtained some funds by"
6589,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"subscription; but under the expectation, 'tis said, of a public grant,"
6590,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"has done nothing. Lastly, there is the ""Institute of Irish Architects,"""
6591,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"founded in 1839 ""for the general advancement of civil architecture, for"
6592,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,promoting and facilitating the acquirement of a knowledge of the
6593,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"various arts and sciences connected therewith, for the formation of a"
6594,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"library and museum,"" etc."
6595,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,
6596,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"To us it is very plain that here are too many institutions, and that"
6597,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,the efficiency of all suffers materially from their want of connection
6598,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"and arrangement. Some, at least, might be amalgamated with great"
6599,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"advantage, or rather all, except the Art Union. That is only a club of"
6600,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"purchasers, and any attempt materially to change its nature would peril"
6601,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,its funds. Some such plan as the following would accomplish all that is
6602,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"vainly attempted now. Let the Government be pressed to give £2,000 a"
6603,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"year, if the public supply £1,000 a year. Let this income go to a new"
6604,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"Hibernian Academy--the present Hibernian Academy, Artists' Society,"
6605,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"Society of Ancient Art, the Art Schools of the Dublin Society, and the"
6606,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,Institute of Irish Architects being merged in it. This merger could be
6607,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"easily secured through the inducements secured by the charter, and by"
6608,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"accommodation, salaries, and utility of the new body. The present"
6609,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"property of these bodies, with some moderate grant, would suffice for"
6610,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"the purchase of a space of ground ample for the schools, museums,"
6611,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"library, lecture-room, and yards of such an institution."
6612,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,
6613,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,At the head of it should be a small body governing and accounting for
6614,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"its finances, but _no person_ should be a governing member of more than"
6615,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"one of its sections. These sections should be for Statuary, Painting,"
6616,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"Architecture, and Design Drawing. Each of these sections should have"
6617,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,its own Gallery and its own Practice Rooms; but one Library and one
6618,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,public Lecture Room would suffice for the entire. The architectural
6619,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,section would also need some open space for its experiments and its
6620,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"larger specimens. A present of copies of the British Museum casts,"
6621,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"along with the fund of the Ancient Art Society, would originate a Cast"
6622,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"Gallery, and a few good pictures could be bought as a commencement of a"
6623,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"National Gallery of Painting, leaving the economy of the managers and"
6624,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,the liberality of the public gradually to fill up. Collections of
6625,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"native works in canvas and marble, and architectural models, could be"
6626,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,soon and cheaply procured. The Art Library of the Dublin Society added
6627,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,to that of the Hibernian Academy would need few additions to make it
6628,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,sufficient for the new body.
6629,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,
6630,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,Such an Institute ought not to employ any but the best teachers and
6631,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,lecturers. It should encourage proficiency by rewards that would
6632,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"instruct the proficient; it should apply itself to cataloguing,"
6633,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"preserving, and making known all the works of art in the country; give"
6634,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,prizes for artistical works; publish its lectures and transactions;
6635,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,issue engravings of the most instructive works of art; and hold evening
6636,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"meetings, to which ladies would be admitted. It should allow at least"
6637,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,£400 a year for the support of free pupils. In connection with its
6638,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"drawing and modelling schools should be a professorship of anatomy, or,"
6639,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"what were better, some arrangement might be made with the College of"
6640,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"Surgeons, or some such body, for courses of instruction for its pupils."
6641,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"The training for its pupils in sculpture, painting, and design should"
6642,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"include the study of ancient and modern costumes, zoology, and of"
6643,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,vegetable and geological forms. For this purpose books should not be so
6644,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"much relied on as lectures in gardens, museums, and during student"
6645,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,excursions. Of course the architectural pupils should be required to
6646,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"answer at a preliminary examination in mathematics, and should receive"
6647,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"special instruction in the building materials, action of climate, etc.,"
6648,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,in Ireland.
6649,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,
6650,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"Were the buildings standing, and the society chartered judiciously, the"
6651,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,sum we have mentioned would be sufficient. Four professors at from £200
6652,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"to £300 a year each, four assistants at £100 a year each, a librarian"
6653,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"at the same rate, with payments for extra instruction in anatomy, etc.,"
6654,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"etc., and for porters, premiums, and so forth, would not exceed £2,000"
6655,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"a year. So that if £400 were expended on free pupils, there would"
6656,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,remain £600 a year for the purchase of works for the galleries.
6657,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,
6658,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"At present there is much waste of money, great annoyance and loss of"
6659,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"time to the supporters of these institutions, and marvellously little"
6660,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,benefit to art. The plan we have proposed would be economical both of
6661,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"time and money; but, what is of more worth, it would give us, what we"
6662,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"have not now, a National Gallery of Statuary and Painting--good"
6663,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,Exhibition Rooms for works of art--business-like Lecturers and
6664,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"Lectures--great public excitement about art--and, finally, a great"
6665,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,National Academy.
6666,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,
6667,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"If anyone has a better plan, let him say it; we have told ours. At all"
6668,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"events, some great change is needed, and there can be no fitter time"
6669,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,than this for it.
6670,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,
6671,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"In any community it is desirable to have Literary Institutions, as well"
6672,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"classified as legal offices, and as free from counteraction; but it is"
6673,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"especially desirable here now. Our literary class is small, and its"
6674,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,duties measureless. The diseased suction of London--the absence of
6675,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"gentry, offices, and Legislature--the heart-sickness that is on every"
6676,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"thoughtful man without a country--the want of a large, educated, and"
6677,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,therefore book-buying class--and (it must be confessed) the depression
6678,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"and distrust produced by rash experiments and paltry failure, have left"
6679,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,us with few men for a great work. Probably the great remedy is the
6680,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"restoration of our Parliament--bringing back, as it would, the"
6681,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"aristocracy and the public offices, giving society and support to"
6682,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"Writers and Artists, and giving them a country's praise to move and a"
6683,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,country's glory to reward them.
6684,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,
6685,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,But one of the very means of attaining nationality is securing some
6686,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,portion of that literary force which would gush abundantly from it;
6687,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"and, therefore, consider it how you will, it is important to increase"
6688,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,and economise the exertions of the literary class in Ireland. Yet the
6689,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,reverse is done. Institutions are multiplied instead of those being
6690,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,made efficient which exist; and men talk as proudly of the new
6691,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"""Teach-'em-everything-in-no-time-Society"" as if its natty laws were a"
6692,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"library, its desk a laboratory and a museum, and its members fresh"
6693,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"labourers, when all they have done is to waste the time of persons who"
6694,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"had business, and to delude those who had none, into the belief that"
6695,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,they were doing good. Ephemeral things! which die not without
6696,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,mischief--they have wasted hours and days of strong men in spinning
6697,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"sand, and leave depression growing from their tombs."
6698,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,
6699,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"It is a really useful deed to rescue from dissipation, or from idle"
6700,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"reading, or from mammon-hunting, one strong, passionate man or boy, and"
6701,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"to set him to work investigating, arranging, teaching. It is an honest"
6702,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,task to shame the 'broidered youth from meditation on waistcoats and
6703,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,the display of polka steps into manly pursuits. It is an angel's
6704,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,mission (oftenest the work of love) to startle a sleeping and
6705,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,unconscious genius into the spring and victory of a roused lion. But it
6706,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,is worse than useless to establish new associations and orders without
6707,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,well considering first whether the same machinery do not already exist
6708,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,and rust for want of the very energy and skill which you need too.
6709,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,There is a bridge in a field near Blarney Castle where water never ran.
6710,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"It was built ""at the expense of the county."" These men build their"
6711,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"mills close as houses in a capital, taking no thought for the stream to"
6712,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,turn them.
6713,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,
6714,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,We have already censured this in some detail with reference to
6715,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"societies for the promotion of the Fine Arts, and have urged the"
6716,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"formation, out of all these fiddling, clashing bodies, of some one"
6717,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"great institution for the promotion of Painting, Sculpture, and"
6718,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"Architecture, with a Museum, a Library, a Gallery, and Lecturers,"
6719,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"governed by professional minds, great enough to be known and regarded"
6720,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"by the people, and popular and strong enough to secure Government"
6721,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,support.
6722,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,
6723,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,Similar defects exist everywhere. Take the Dublin Society for example.
6724,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,Nothing can be more heterogeneous than its objects. We are far from
6725,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"denying its utility. That utility is immense, the institution is"
6726,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"native, of old standing (it was founded in 1731), national, and, when"
6727,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"it wanted support, our pen was not idle in its behalf."
6728,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,
6729,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,But we believe its utility greatly diminished by its attempting too
6730,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"many things, and especially by including objects more fitly belonging"
6731,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"to other institutions; and on the opposite side it is maimed, by the"
6732,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"interference of other bodies, in its natural functions. The Dublin"
6733,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,Society was founded for the promotion of husbandry and other useful
6734,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,arts. Its labours to serve agriculture have been repeated and
6735,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"extensive, though not always judicious. It has also endeavoured to"
6736,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,promote manufactures. It has gardens and museums fitter for scientific
6737,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"than practical instruction, admirable lecturers, a library most"
6738,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"generously opened, a drawing-school of the largest purposes and of"
6739,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"equivocal success, and various minor branches."
6740,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,
6741,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,The Irish Academy has some of this fault. It endeavours to unite
6742,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,antiquarianism and abstract science. Its meetings are alternately
6743,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"entertained with mathematics and history, and its transactions are"
6744,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,equally comprehensive. We yield to none in anxiety for the promotion of
6745,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,antiquarian studies; we think the public and the government disgraced
6746,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,by the slight support given to the Academy. We are not a little proud
6747,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,of the honour and strength given to our country by the science of
6748,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"MacCullagh, Hamilton, and Lloyd; but we protest against the attempt to"
6749,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"mix the armoury of the ancient Irish, or the Celtic dialects, or the"
6750,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"essay on Round Towers, with trigonometry and the calculus, whether in a"
6751,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,lecture-room or a book.
6752,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,
6753,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"Let us just set down, as we find them, some of the Literary and"
6754,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"Scientific Institutions. There are the Royal Dublin Society, the Royal"
6755,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,Irish Academy (we wish these royalties were dropped--no one minds
6756,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"them), the Irish Archæological Society, the Royal Zoological Society,"
6757,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"the Geological Society, the Dublin Natural History Society, the Dublin"
6758,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"Philosophical Society, the Royal Agricultural Society, etc., etc. Now,"
6759,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"we take it that these bodies might be usefully reduced to three, and if"
6760,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,three moderate government grants were made under conditions rewarding
6761,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"such a classification, we doubt not it would instantly be made."
6762,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,
6763,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"In the first place, we would divorce from the Irish Academy the"
6764,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"scientific department, requiring Trinity College to form some voluntary"
6765,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,organisation for the purpose. To this non-collegiate philosophers
6766,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"should be admitted, and, thus disencumbered, we would devote the"
6767,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,Academy to antiquities and literature--incorporate with it the
6768,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,Archæological Society--transfer to it all the antiques (of which it had
6769,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"not duplicates) in Trinity College, the Dublin Society, etc., and"
6770,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"enlarge its museums and meeting-room. Its section of ""polite"
6771,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"literature"" has long been a name--it should be made real. There would"
6772,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,be nothing inconvenient or strange in finding in its lecture-rooms or
6773,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"transactions the antiquities and literature of Ireland, diversified by"
6774,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"general historical, critical, and æsthetical researches."
6775,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,
6776,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"The Dublin Society would reasonably divide into two sections. One, for"
6777,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"the promotion of husbandry, might be aggrandised by tempting the"
6778,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"Agricultural Society to join it, and should have a permanent museum, an"
6779,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"extensive farm, premiums, shows, publications, and special lecturers."
6780,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"The second section, for the encouragement of manufactures, should have"
6781,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"its museum, workshops, and experiment ground (the last, perhaps, as the"
6782,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"agricultural farm), and its special lecturers. The library might well"
6783,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"be joint, and managed by a joint committee, having separate funds. The"
6784,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,general lecturers on chemistry and other such subjects might be paid in
6785,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,common. The drawing school (save that for pattern and machine drawing)
6786,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,might be transferred to the Art Institution; and the botanic garden and
6787,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,museum of minerals to a third body we propose.
6788,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,
6789,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"This third body we would form from a union of the Zoological, the"
6790,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"Geological, the Natural History, and all other such societies, and"
6791,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,endow it with the Botanic and Zoological Gardens--give it rooms for a
6792,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"general and for a specially Irish museum, and for lecture-rooms in"
6793,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"town, and supply it with a small fund to pay lecturers, who should go"
6794,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,through the provinces.
6795,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,
6796,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,We are firmly convinced that this re-arrangement of the Institutions of
6797,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"Dublin is quite practicable, would diminish unproductive expenses,"
6798,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"economise the time, and condense the purposes of our literary,"
6799,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"scientific, and artistical men, and increase enormously the use of the"
6800,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,institutions to the public.
6801,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,
6802,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,Of course the whole plan will be laughed at as fanciful and improbable;
6803,INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION OF FINE ARTS.,"we think it easy, and we think it will be done."

6824,"IRELAND'S PEOPLE, LORDS, GENTRY, COMMONALTY.",separate duty in this crisis of her fate. They all have
6825,"IRELAND'S PEOPLE, LORDS, GENTRY, COMMONALTY.",responsibilities; but the infamy of failing in them is not alike in

6838,"IRELAND'S PEOPLE, LORDS, GENTRY, COMMONALTY.",contributing to its degradation.

6840,"IRELAND'S PEOPLE, LORDS, GENTRY, COMMONALTY.",It is a foul thing this--dignity emanating from the throne to gild the

6857,"IRELAND'S PEOPLE, LORDS, GENTRY, COMMONALTY.","thus, in his multiplex capacity, he is admitted into fellowship with"
6858,"IRELAND'S PEOPLE, LORDS, GENTRY, COMMONALTY.","the English nobility. The borrowed plumes, the delegated authority of"

6860,"IRELAND'S PEOPLE, LORDS, GENTRY, COMMONALTY.","English nobleman. And, although thus deprived of their inheritance of"
6861,"IRELAND'S PEOPLE, LORDS, GENTRY, COMMONALTY.","dignity, they are not allowed even the privilege of a commoner. An"

6864,"IRELAND'S PEOPLE, LORDS, GENTRY, COMMONALTY.",
6865,"IRELAND'S PEOPLE, LORDS, GENTRY, COMMONALTY.",But an Irish lord can represent an English constituency. The
6866,"IRELAND'S PEOPLE, LORDS, GENTRY, COMMONALTY.",distinction is a strange one--unintelligible to us in any sense but one

6871,"IRELAND'S PEOPLE, LORDS, GENTRY, COMMONALTY.","distinction!--he is above the rank of an Irish commoner, nor is he"
6872,"IRELAND'S PEOPLE, LORDS, GENTRY, COMMONALTY.",permitted to sully his name with the privileges of that order.

6913,"IRELAND'S PEOPLE, LORDS, GENTRY, COMMONALTY.",is a strife in which it will be stainless glory to be even defeated. It
6914,"IRELAND'S PEOPLE, LORDS, GENTRY, COMMONALTY.",is one in which the Irish nobility have the first interest and the

7159,IRISH SCENERY.,
7160,IRISH SCENERY.,
7161,IRISH SCENERY.,We no more see why Irish people should not visit the Continent than why
7162,IRISH SCENERY.,Germans or Frenchmen ought not to visit Ireland; but there is a
7163,IRISH SCENERY.,difference between them. A German rarely comes here who has not
7164,IRISH SCENERY.,"trampled the heath of Tyrol, studied the museums of Dresden and the"
7165,IRISH SCENERY.,"frescoes of Munich, and shouted defiance on the bank of the Rhine; and"
7166,IRISH SCENERY.,what Frenchman who has not seen the vineyards of Provence and the
7167,IRISH SCENERY.,"bocages of Brittany, and the snows of Jura and the Pyrenees, ever drove"
7168,IRISH SCENERY.,"on an Irish jingle? But our nobles and country gentlemen, our"
7169,IRISH SCENERY.,"merchants, lawyers, and doctors--and what's worse, their wives and"
7170,IRISH SCENERY.,daughters--penetrate Britain and the Continent without ever trying
7171,IRISH SCENERY.,whether they could not defy in Ireland the _ennui_ before which they
7172,IRISH SCENERY.,run over seas and mountains.
7173,IRISH SCENERY.,
7174,IRISH SCENERY.,"The cause of this, as of most of our grievances, was misgovernment,"
7175,IRISH SCENERY.,"producing poverty, discomfort, ignorance, and misrepresentation. The"
7176,IRISH SCENERY.,"people were ignorant and in rags, their houses miserable, the roads and"
7177,IRISH SCENERY.,"hotels shocking; we had no banks, few coaches, and, to crown all, the"
7178,IRISH SCENERY.,"English declared the people to be rude and turbulent, which they were"
7179,IRISH SCENERY.,"not, as well as drunken and poor, which they assuredly were. An Irish"
7180,IRISH SCENERY.,landlord who had ill-treated his own tenants felt a conscientious dread
7181,IRISH SCENERY.,"of all frieze-coats; others adopted his prejudices, and a people who"
7182,IRISH SCENERY.,never were rude or unjust to strangers were considered unsafe to travel
7183,IRISH SCENERY.,amongst.
7184,IRISH SCENERY.,
7185,IRISH SCENERY.,"Most of these causes are removed. The people are sober, and are rapidly"
7186,IRISH SCENERY.,"advancing to knowledge, their political exertions and dignity have"
7187,IRISH SCENERY.,"broken away much of the prejudices against them, and a man passing"
7188,IRISH SCENERY.,through any part of Ireland expects to find woeful poverty and strong
7189,IRISH SCENERY.,"discontent, but he does not fear the abduction of his wife, or attempts"
7190,IRISH SCENERY.,"to assassinate him on every lonely road. The coaches, cars, and roads,"
7191,IRISH SCENERY.,"too, have become excellent, and the hotels are sufficient for any"
7192,IRISH SCENERY.,reasonable traveller. One very marked discouragement to travelling was
7193,IRISH SCENERY.,"the want of information; the maps were little daubs, and the"
7194,IRISH SCENERY.,guide-books were few and inaccurate. As to maps we are now splendidly
7195,IRISH SCENERY.,"off. The Railway Commissioners' Map of Ireland, aided by the Ordnance"
7196,IRISH SCENERY.,"Index Map of any county where a visitor makes a long stay, are ample."
7197,IRISH SCENERY.,"We have got a good general guide-book in Fraser, but it could not hold"
7198,IRISH SCENERY.,"a twentieth of the information necessary to a leisurely tourist; nor,"
7199,IRISH SCENERY.,"till the Ordnance Memoir is out, shall we have thorough hand-books to"
7200,IRISH SCENERY.,"our counties. Meantime, let us not burn the little guides to Antrim,"
7201,IRISH SCENERY.,"Wicklow, and Killarney, though they are desperately dull and"
7202,IRISH SCENERY.,"inexact--let us not altogether prohibit Mrs. Hall's gossip, though she"
7203,IRISH SCENERY.,knows less about our Celtic people than the Malays; and let us be even
7204,IRISH SCENERY.,thankful for Mr. O'Flanagan's volume of the Munster Blackwater (though
7205,IRISH SCENERY.,"it is printed in London) for his valuable stories, for his minute,"
7206,IRISH SCENERY.,"picturesque, and full topography, for his antiquarian and historic"
7207,IRISH SCENERY.,"details, though he blunders into making Alaster M'Donnell a Scotchman,"
7208,IRISH SCENERY.,and for his hearty love of the scenery and people he has undertaken to
7209,IRISH SCENERY.,guide us through.
7210,IRISH SCENERY.,
7211,IRISH SCENERY.,"And now, reader, in this fine soft summer, when the heather is"
7212,IRISH SCENERY.,"blooming, and the sky laughing and crying like a hysterical bride, full"
7213,IRISH SCENERY.,"of love, where will ye go--through your own land or a stranger's? If"
7214,IRISH SCENERY.,"you stay at home you can choose your own scenery, and have something to"
7215,IRISH SCENERY.,"see in the summer, and talk of in the winter, that will make your"
7216,IRISH SCENERY.,friends from the Alps and Apennines respectful to you.
7217,IRISH SCENERY.,
7218,IRISH SCENERY.,Did you propose to study economies among the metayers of Tuscany or the
7219,IRISH SCENERY.,"artisans of Belgium, postpone the trip till the summer of '45 or '46,"
7220,IRISH SCENERY.,"when you may have the passport of an Irish office to get you a welcome,"
7221,IRISH SCENERY.,and seek for the state of the linen weavers in the soft hamlets of
7222,IRISH SCENERY.,Ulster--compare the cattle herds of Meath with the safe little holdings
7223,IRISH SCENERY.,"of Down and the well-found farms of Tipperary, or investigate the"
7224,IRISH SCENERY.,statistics of our fisheries along the rivers and lakes and shores of
7225,IRISH SCENERY.,our island.
7226,IRISH SCENERY.,
7227,IRISH SCENERY.,"Had a strong desire come upon you to toil over the glacier, whose"
7228,IRISH SCENERY.,"centre froze when Adam courted Eve, or walk amid the brigand passes of"
7229,IRISH SCENERY.,Italy or Spain--do not fancy that absolute size makes mountain
7230,IRISH SCENERY.,"grandeur, or romance--to a mind full of passion and love of strength"
7231,IRISH SCENERY.,(and with such only do the mountain spirits walk) the passes of
7232,IRISH SCENERY.,"Glenmalure and Barnesmore are deep as Chamouni, and Carn Tual and"
7233,IRISH SCENERY.,Slieve Donard are as near the lightning as Mount Blanc.
7234,IRISH SCENERY.,
7235,IRISH SCENERY.,"To the picture-hunter we can offer little, though Vandyke's finest"
7236,IRISH SCENERY.,"portrait is in Kilkenny, and there is no county without some"
7237,IRISH SCENERY.,collection; but for the lover of living or sculptured forms--for the
7238,IRISH SCENERY.,"artist, the antiquarian, and the natural philosopher, we have more than"
7239,IRISH SCENERY.,"five summers could exhaust. Every one can see the strength of outline,"
7240,IRISH SCENERY.,"the vigour of colour, and the effective grouping in every fair, and"
7241,IRISH SCENERY.,"wake, and chapel, and hurling-ground, from Donegal to Waterford, though"
7242,IRISH SCENERY.,it may take the pen of Griffin or the pencil of Burton to represent
7243,IRISH SCENERY.,"them. An Irishman, if he took the pains, would surely find something"
7244,IRISH SCENERY.,not inferior in interest to Cologne or the Alhambra in study of the
7245,IRISH SCENERY.,"monumental effigies which mat the floors of Jerpoint and Adare, or the"
7246,IRISH SCENERY.,cross in a hundred consecrated grounds from Kells to Clonmacnoise--of
7247,IRISH SCENERY.,the round towers which spring in every barony--of the architectural
7248,IRISH SCENERY.,"perfection of Holycross and Clare-Galway, and the strange fellowship of"
7249,IRISH SCENERY.,"every order in Athassel, or of the military keeps and earthen pyramids"
7250,IRISH SCENERY.,"and cairns, which tell of the wars of recent and the piety of distant"
7251,IRISH SCENERY.,"centuries. The Entomology, Botany, and Geology of Ireland are not half"
7252,IRISH SCENERY.,explored; the structure and distinctions of its races are but just
7253,IRISH SCENERY.,"attracting the eyes of philosophers from Mr. Wilde's tract, and the"
7254,IRISH SCENERY.,"country is actually full of airs never noted, history never written,"
7255,IRISH SCENERY.,superstitions and romances never rescued from tradition; and why should
7256,IRISH SCENERY.,Irishmen go blundering in foreign researches when so much remains to be
7257,IRISH SCENERY.,"done here, and when to do it would be more easy, more honourable, and"
7258,IRISH SCENERY.,more useful?
7259,IRISH SCENERY.,
7260,IRISH SCENERY.,In many kinds of scenery we can challenge comparison. Europe has no
7261,IRISH SCENERY.,lake so dreamily beautiful as Killarney; no bays where the boldness of
7262,IRISH SCENERY.,"Norway unites with the colouring of Naples, as in Bantry; and you might"
7263,IRISH SCENERY.,coast the world without finding cliffs so vast and so terrible as
7264,IRISH SCENERY.,"Achill and Slieve League. Glorious, too, as the Rhine is, we doubt if"
7265,IRISH SCENERY.,its warmest admirers would exclude from rivalry the Nore and the
7266,IRISH SCENERY.,"Blackwater, if they had seen the tall cliffs, and the twisted slopes,"
7267,IRISH SCENERY.,"and the ruined aisles, and glancing mountains, and feudal castles"
7268,IRISH SCENERY.,"through which you boat up from Youghal to Mallow, or glide down from"
7269,IRISH SCENERY.,Thomastown to Waterford harbour. Hear what Inglis says of this
7270,IRISH SCENERY.,Avondhu:--
7271,IRISH SCENERY.,
7272,IRISH SCENERY.,"""We have had descents of the Danube, and descents of the Rhine, and"
7273,IRISH SCENERY.,"the Rhone, and of many other rivers; but we have not in print, as"
7274,IRISH SCENERY.,"far as I know, any descent of the Blackwater; and yet, with all"
7275,IRISH SCENERY.,"these descents of foreign rivers in my recollection, _I think the"
7276,IRISH SCENERY.,descent of the Blackwater not surpassed by any of them._ A detail
7277,IRISH SCENERY.,of all that is seen in gliding down the Blackwater from Cappoquin
7278,IRISH SCENERY.,to Youghal would fill a long chapter. There is every combination
7279,IRISH SCENERY.,that can be produced by the elements that enter into the
7280,IRISH SCENERY.,"picturesque and the beautiful--deep shades, bold rocks, verdant"
7281,IRISH SCENERY.,"slopes, with the triumphs of art superadded, and made visible in"
7282,IRISH SCENERY.,magnificent houses and beautiful villas with their decorated lawns
7283,IRISH SCENERY.,"and pleasure grounds."""
7284,IRISH SCENERY.,
7285,IRISH SCENERY.,"And now, reader, if these kaleidoscope glimpses we have given you have"
7286,IRISH SCENERY.,"made you doubt between a summer in Ireland and one abroad, give your"
7287,IRISH SCENERY.,"country ""the benefit of the doubt,"" as the lawyers say, and boat on our"
7288,IRISH SCENERY.,"lake or dive into our glens and ruins, wonder at the basalt coast of"

7321,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"Scotland, and German opera cries--are heard in our concerts, and what"
7322,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"is worse, from our Temperance bands. Yet we never doubted that ""The"

7324,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,most spoiled of our fashionables better than anything Balfe or Rossini

7329,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"A reprint of _Moore's Melodies_ on lower keys, and at _much_ lower"

7331,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,natural supremacy. There are in Bunting but two good sets of
7332,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"words--""The Bonny Cuckoo,"" and poor Campbell's ""Exile's of Erin."" These"
7333,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,and a few of Lover's and Mahony's songs can alone compete with Moore.
7334,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"But, save one or two by Lysaght and Drennan, almost all the Irish"
7335,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,political songs are too desponding or weak to content a people marching
7336,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,to independence as proudly as if they had never been slaves.
7337,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,
7338,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,The popularity and immense circulation of the _Spirit of the Nation_
7339,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,proved that it represented the hopes and passions of the Irish people.
7340,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,This looks like vanity; but as a corporation so numerous as the
7341,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"contributors to that volume cannot blush, we shall say our say. For"
7342,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"instance, who did not admire ""The Memory of the Dead""? The very Stamp"
7343,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"officers were galvanised by it, and the Attorney-General was repeatedly"
7344,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,urged to sing it for the jury. He refused--he had no music to sing it
7345,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,to. We pitied and forgave him; but we vowed to leave him no such excuse
7346,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"next time. If these songs were half so good as people called them, they"
7347,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,deserved to flow from a million throats to as noble music as ever
7348,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,O'Neill or O'Connor heard.
7349,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,
7350,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"Some of them were written to, and some freely combined with, old and"
7351,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"suitable airs. These we resolved to have printed with the music,"
7352,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"certain that, thus, the music would be given back to a people who had"
7353,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"been ungratefully neglecting it, and the words carried into circles"
7354,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,where they were still unknown.
7355,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,
7356,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"Others of these poems, indeed the best of them, had no antetypes in our"
7357,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"ancient music. New music was, therefore, to be sought for them. Not on"
7358,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,their account only was it to be sought. We hoped they would be the
7359,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,means of calling out and making known a contemporary music fresh with
7360,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"the spirit of the time, and rooted in the country."
7361,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,
7362,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,Since Carolan's death there had been no addition to the store. Not that
7363,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"we were without composers, but those we have do not compose Irish-like"
7364,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"music, nor for Ireland. Their rewards are from a foreign public--their"
7365,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"fame, we fear, will suffer from alienage. Balfe is very sweet, and"
7366,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"Rooke very emphatic, but not one passion or association in Ireland's"

7368,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,
7369,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,Fortunately there was one among us (perchance his example may light us
7370,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"to others) who can smite upon our harp like a master, and make it sigh"
7371,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"with Irish memories, and speak sternly with Ireland's resolve. To him,"
7372,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"to his patriotism, to his genius, and, we may selfishly add, to his"
7373,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"friendship, we owe our ability now to give to Ireland music fit for"
7374,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"""The Memory of the Dead"" and the ""Hymn of Freedom,"" and whatever else"
7375,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,was marked out by popularity for such care as his.
7376,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,
7377,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,In former editions of the _Spirit_[45] we had thrown in carelessly
7378,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"several inferior verses and some positive trash, and neither paper nor"
7379,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,printing was any great honour to the Dublin press. Every improvement in
7380,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"the power of the most enterprising publisher in Ireland has been made,"
7381,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"and every fault, within our reach or his, cured--and whether as the"
7382,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"first publication of original airs, as a selection of ancient music, or"
7383,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"as a specimen of what the Dublin press can do, in printing, paper, or"
7384,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"cheapness, we urge the public to support this work of Mr. James"
7385,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"Duffy's--and, in a pecuniary way, it is his altogether."
7386,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,
7387,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,We had hoped to have added a recommendation to the first number of this
7388,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"work, besides whatever attraction may lie in its music, its ballads, or"
7389,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,its mechanical beauty.
7390,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,
7391,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"An artist, whom we shall not describe or he would be known,[46] sketched"
7392,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"a cover and title for it. The idea, composition, and drawing of that"
7393,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,design were such as Flaxman might have been proud of. It is a monument
7394,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"to bardic power, to patriotism, to our music and our history. There is"
7395,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,at least as much poetry in it as in the best verses in the work it
7396,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"illustrates. If it do nothing else, it will show our Irish artists that"
7397,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"refinement and strength, passion and dignity, are as practicable in"
7398,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,Irish as in German painting; and the lesson was needed sorely. But if
7399,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,it lead him who drew it to see that our history and hopes present fit
7400,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"forms to embody the highest feelings of beauty, wisdom, truth, and"
7401,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"glory in, irrespective of party politics, then, indeed, we shall have"
7402,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,served our country when we induced our gifted friend to condescend to
7403,IRISH MUSIC AND POETRY.,"sketching a title-page. We need not describe that design now, as it"

7432,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"as if he came yesterday""; yet they quietly assumed that the Norman and"
7433,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,Saxon elements would disappear under the Gaelic genius like the tracks
7434,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,of cavalry under a fresh crop.
7435,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7436,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,The Nationality of Swift and Grattan was equally partial. They saw that
7437,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,the government and laws of the settlers had extended to the
7438,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,island--that Donegal and Kerry were in the Pale; they heard the English
7439,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"tongue in Dublin, and London opinions in Dublin--they mistook Ireland"
7440,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"for a colony wronged, and great enough to be a nation."
7441,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7442,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,A lower form of nationhood was before the minds of those who saw in it
7443,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,nothing but a parliament in College Green. They had not erred in
7444,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"judging, for they had not tried to estimate the moral elements and"
7445,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,tendencies of the country. They were as narrow bigots to the
7446,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"omnipotency of an institution as any Cockney Radical. Could they, by"
7447,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"any accumulation of English stupidity and Irish laziness, have got"
7448,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"possession of an Irish government, they would soon have distressed"
7449,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"every one by their laws, whom they had not provoked by their"
7450,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"administration, or disgusted by their dulness."
7451,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7452,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"Far healthier, with all its defects, was the idea of those who saw in"
7453,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,Scotland a perfect model--who longed for a literary and artistic
7454,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"nationality--who prized the oratory of Grattan and Curran, the novels"
7455,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"of Griffin and Carleton, the pictures of Maclise and Burton, the"
7456,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"ancient music, as much as any, and far more than most, of the political"
7457,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"nationalists, but who regarded political independence as a dangerous"
7458,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"dream. Unknowingly they fostered it. Their writings, their patronage,"
7459,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,their talk was of Ireland; yet it hardly occurred to them that the
7460,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"ideal would flow into the practical, or that they, with their dread of"
7461,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"agitation, were forwarding a revolution."
7462,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7463,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"At last we are beginning to see what we are, and what is our destiny."
7464,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,Our duty arises where our knowledge begins. The elements of Irish
7465,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"nationality are not only combining--in fact, they are growing confluent"
7466,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,in our minds. Such nationality as merits a good man's help and wakens a
7467,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,true man's ambition--such nationality as could stand against internal
7468,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,faction and foreign intrigue--such nationality as would make the Irish
7469,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"hearth happy and the Irish name illustrious, is becoming understood. It"
7470,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"must contain and represent the races of Ireland. It must not be Celtic,"
7471,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,it must not be Saxon--it must be Irish. The Brehon law and the maxims
7472,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"of Westminster, the cloudy and lightning genius of the Gael, the placid"
7473,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"strength of the Sasanach, the marshalling insight of the Norman--a"
7474,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,literature which shall exhibit in combination the passions and idioms
7475,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"of all, and which shall equally express our mind in its romantic, its"
7476,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"religious, its forensic, and its practical tendencies--finally, a"
7477,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"native government, which shall know and rule by the might and right of"
7478,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,all; yet yield to the arrogance of none--these are components of
7479,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,_such_ a nationality.
7480,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7481,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"But what have these things to do with the ""Ballad Poetry of Ireland""?"
7482,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,Much every way. It is the result of the elements we have named--it is
7483,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,compounded of all; and never was there a book fitter to advance that
7484,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,perfect nationality to which Ireland begins to aspire. That a country
7485,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,is without national poetry proves its hopeless dulness or its utter
7486,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,provincialism. National poetry is the very flowering of the soul--the
7487,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"greatest evidence of its health, the greatest excellence of its beauty."
7488,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,Its melody is balsam to the senses. It is the playfellow of childhood
7489,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"ripens into the companion of his manhood, consoles his age. It presents"
7490,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"the most dramatic events, the largest characters, the most impressive"
7491,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"scenes, and the deepest passions in the language most familiar to us."
7492,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"It shows us magnified, and ennobles our hearts, our intellects, our"
7493,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"country, and our countrymen--binds us to the land by its condensed and"
7494,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"gem-like history, to the future by examples and by aspirations. It"
7495,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"solaces us in travel, fires us in action, prompts our invention, sheds"
7496,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"a grace beyond the power of luxury round our homes, is the recognised"
7497,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,envoy of our minds among all mankind and to all time.
7498,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7499,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"In possessing the powers and elements of a glorious nationality, we"
7500,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,owned the sources of a national poetry. In the combination and joint
7501,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,development of the latter we find a pledge and a help to that of the
7502,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,former.
7503,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7504,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"This book of Mr. Duffy's,[47] true as it is to the wants of the time, is"
7505,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,not fortuitous. He has prefaced his admirable collection by an
7506,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"Introduction, which proves his full consciousness of the worth of his"
7507,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"task, and proves equally his ability to execute it. In a space too"
7508,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,short for the most impatient to run by he has accurately investigated
7509,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"the sources of Irish Ballad Poetry, vividly defined the qualities of"
7510,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"each, and laboured with perfect success to show that all naturally"
7511,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"combine towards one great end, as the brooks to a river, which marches"
7512,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"on clear, deep, and single, though they be wild, and shallow, and"
7513,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"turbid, flowing from unlike regions, and meeting after countless"
7514,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,windings.
7515,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7516,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,Mr. Duffy maps out three main forces which unequally contribute to an
7517,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,Irish Ballad Poetry.
7518,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7519,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,The _first_ consists of the Gaelic ballads. True to the vehemence and
7520,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"tendencies of the Celtic people, and representing equally their"
7521,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"vagueness and extravagance during slavish times, they nevertheless"
7522,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"remain locked from the middle and upper classes generally, and from the"
7523,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"peasantry of more than half Ireland, in an unknown language. Many of"
7524,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,them have been translated by rhymers--few indeed by poets. The editor
7525,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,of the volume before us has brought into one house nearly all the
7526,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"poetical translations from the Irish, and thus finely justifies the"
7527,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,ballad literature of the Gael from its calumnious friend:--
7528,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7529,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"""With a few exceptions, all the translations we are acquainted"
7530,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"with, in addition to having abundance of minor faults, are"
7531,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,eminently un-Irish. They seem to have been made by persons to whom
7532,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,one of the languages was not familiar. Many of them were
7533,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"confessedly versified from prose translations, and are mere English"
7534,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"poems, without a tinge of the colour or character of the country."
7535,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"Others, translated by sound Irish scholars, are bald and literal;"
7536,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"the writers sometimes wanting a facility of versification,"
7537,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,sometimes a mastery over the English language. The Irish scholars
7538,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,of the last century were too exclusively national to study the
7539,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,foreign tongue with the care essential to master its metrical
7540,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,resources; and the flexible and weighty language which they had not
7541,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"learned to wield hung heavily on them,"
7542,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7543,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"'Like Saul's plate armour on the shepherd boy,"
7544,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"Encumbering, and _not_ arming them.'"
7545,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7546,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,If it were just to estimate our bardic poetry by the specimens we
7547,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"have received in this manner, it could not be rated highly. But it"
7548,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"would manifestly be most unjust. Noble and touching, and often"
7549,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"subtle and profound thoughts, which no translation could entirely"
7550,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"spoil, shine through the poverty of the style, and vindicate the"
7551,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,character of the originals. Like the costly arms and ornaments
7552,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"found in our bogs, they are substantial witnesses of a distinct"
7553,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,civilisation; and their credit is no more diminished by the rubbish
7554,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,in which they chance to be found than the authenticity of the
7555,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,ancient _torques_ and _skians_ by their embedment in the mud.
7556,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,When the entire collection of our Irish Percy--James Hardiman--shall
7557,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,have been given to a public (and soon may such a one come) that can
7558,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"relish them in their native dress, they will be entitled to"
7559,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"undisputed precedence in our national minstrelsy."""
7560,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7561,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,About a dozen of the ballads in the volume are derived from the Irish.
7562,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,It is only in this way that Clarence Mangan (a name to which Mr. Duffy
7563,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,does just honour) contributes to the volume. There are four
7564,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"translations by him, exhibiting eminently his perfect mastery of"
7565,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"versification--his flexibility of passion, from loneliest grief to the"
7566,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"maddest humour. One of these, ""The Lament for O'Neil and O'Donnell,"" is"
7567,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"the strongest, though it will not be the most popular, ballad in the"
7568,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,work.
7569,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7570,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"Callanan's and Ferguson's translations, if not so daringly versified,"
7571,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,are simpler and more Irish in idiom.
7572,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7573,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"Most, indeed, of Callanan's successful ballads are translations, and"
7574,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,well entitle him to what he passionately prays for--a minstrel of free
7575,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"Erin to come to his grave,"
7576,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7577,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"""And plant a wild wreath from the banks of the river"
7578,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"O'er the heart and the harp that are sleeping for ever."""
7579,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7580,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,But we are wrong in speaking of Mr. Ferguson's translations in
7581,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"precisely the same way. His ""Wicklow War Song"" is condensed,"
7582,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"epigrammatic, and crashing, as anything we know of, except the ""Pibroch"
7583,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"of Donnil Dhu."""
7584,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7585,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,The _second_ source is--the common people's ballads. Most of these
7586,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"""make no pretence to being true to Ireland, but only being true to the"
7587,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"_purlieus_ of Cork and Dublin""; yet now and then one meets a fine burst"
7588,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"of passion, and oftener a racy idiom. The ""Drimin Dhu,"" ""The Blackbird,"""
7589,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"""Peggy Bawn,"" ""Irish Molly,"" ""Willy Reilly,"" and the ""Fair of"
7590,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"Turloughmore,"" are the specimens given here. Of these ""Willy Reilly"""
7591,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"(an old and worthy favourite in Ulster, it seems, but quite unknown"
7592,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"elsewhere) is the best; but it is too long to quote, and we must limit"
7593,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"ourselves to the noble opening verse of ""Turloughmore""--"
7594,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7595,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"""'Come, tell me, dearest mother, what makes my father stay,"
7596,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,Or what can be the reason that he's so long away?'
7597,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"Oh! 'hold your tongue, my darling son, your tears do grieve me"
7598,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,sore;
7599,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"I fear he has been murdered in the fair of Turloughmore.'"""
7600,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7601,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"The _third_ and principal source consists of the Anglo-Irish ballads,"
7602,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,written during the last twenty or thirty years.
7603,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7604,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"Of this highest class, he who contributes most and, to our mind, best"
7605,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,is Mr. Ferguson. We have already spoken of his translations--his
7606,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,original ballads are better. There is nothing in this volume--nothing
7607,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"in _Percy's Relics_, or the _Border Minstrelsy_, to surpass,"
7608,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"perhaps to equal, ""Willy Gilliland."" It is as natural in structure as"
7609,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"""Kinmont Willie,"" as vigorous as ""Otterbourne,"" and as complete as"
7610,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"""Lochinvar."" Leaving his Irish idiom, we get in the ""Forester's"
7611,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"Complaint"" as harmonious versification, and in the ""Forging of the"
7612,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"Anchor"" as vigorous thoughts, mounted on bounding words, as anywhere in"
7613,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,the English literature.
7614,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7615,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"We must quote some stray verses from ""Willy Gilliland"":--"
7616,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7617,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"""Up in the mountain solitudes, and in a rebel ring,"
7618,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"He has worshipped God upon the hill, in spite of church and king;"
7619,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,And sealed his treason with his blood on Bothwell bridge he hath;
7620,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"So he must fly his father's land, or he must die the death;"
7621,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"For comely Claverhouse has come along with grim Dalzell,"
7622,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,And his smoking roof tree testifies they've done their errand well.

7627,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"And laid the basket from his back, the bonnet from his brow;"
7628,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"And there, his hand upon the Book, his knee upon the sod,"
7629,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,He filled the lonely valley with the gladsome word of God;
7630,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"And for a persecuted kirk, and for her martyrs dear,"
7631,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,And against a godless church and king he spoke up loud and clear.

7635,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"""'My bonny mare! I've ridden you when Claver'se rode behind,"
7636,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,And from the thumbscrew and the boot you bore me like the wind;
7637,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"And while I have the life you saved, on your sleek flank, I swear,"

7641,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7642,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"""His fishing-rod with both his hands he gripped it as he spoke,"

7644,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"The limber top he cast away, with all its gear abroad,"

7646,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"He ground the sharp spear to a point; then pulled his bonnet down,"
7647,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"And, meditating black revenge, set forth for Carrick town."""
7648,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7649,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"The only ballad equally racy is ""The Croppy Boy,"" by some anonymous but"
7650,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,most promising writer.
7651,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7652,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"Griffin's ""Gille Machree""--of another class--is perfect--""striking on"
7653,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"the heart,"" as Mr. Duffy finely says, ""like the cry of a woman""; but"
7654,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"his ""Orange and Green,"" and his ""Bridal of Malahide,"" belong to the"
7655,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"same class, and suffer by comparison, with Mr. Ferguson's ballads."
7656,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7657,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"Banim's greatest ballad, the ""Soggarth Aroon,"" possesses even deeper"
7658,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,tenderness and more perfect Irish idiom than anything in the volume.
7659,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7660,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"Among the Collection are Colonel Blacker's famous Orange ballad,"
7661,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"""Oliver's Advice"" (""Put your trust in God, my boys, but keep your"
7662,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"powder dry""), and two versions of the ""Boyne Water."" The latter and"
7663,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"older one, given in the appendix, is by far the finest, and contains"
7664,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,two unrivalled stanzas:--
7665,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7666,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"""Both foot and horse they marched on, intending them to batter, But"
7667,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,the brave Duke Schomberg he was shot as he crossed over the water.

7671,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"yonder men retreating, Our enemies encouraged are--and English"
7672,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"drums are beating'; He says 'My boys, feel no dismay at the losing"
7673,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"of one commander, For God shall be our King this day, and I'll be"
7674,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"general under.'"""
7675,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7676,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,Nor less welcome is the comment:--
7677,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7678,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"""Some of the Ulster ballads, of a restricted and provincial spirit,"
7679,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,having less in common with Ireland than with Scotland; two or three
7680,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"Orange ballads, altogether ferocious or foreign in their tendencies"
7681,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"(preaching murder, or deifying an alien), will be no less valuable"
7682,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,to the patriot or the poet on this account. They echo faithfully
7683,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"the sentiments of a strong, vehement, and indomitable body of"
7684,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"Irishmen, who may come to battle for their country better than they"
7685,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"ever battled for prejudices or their bigotries. At all events, to"
7686,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"know what they love and believe is a precious knowledge."""
7687,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7688,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,On the language of most of the ballads Mr. Duffy says:--
7689,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7690,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"""Many of them, and generally the best, are just as essentially"
7691,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,Irish as if they were written in Gaelic. They could have grown
7692,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"among no other people, perhaps under no other sky or scenery. To an"
7693,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"Englishman, to any Irishman educated out of the country, or to a"
7694,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"dreamer asleep to impressions of scenery and character, they would"
7695,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,be achievements as impossible as the Swedish _Skalds_ or the
7696,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"_Arabian Nights_. They are as Irish as Ossian or Carolan, and"
7697,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,unconsciously reproduce the spirit of those poets better than any
7698,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,translator can hope to do. They revive and perpetuate the vehement
7699,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,native songs that gladdened the halls of our princes in their
7700,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"triumphs, and wailed over their ruined hopes or murdered bodies. In"
7701,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"everything but language, and almost in language, they are"
7702,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"identical. That strange tenacity of the Celtic race, which makes a"
7703,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,description of their habits and propensities when Cæsar was still a
7704,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,Proconsul in Gaul true in essentials of the Irish people to this
7705,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"day, has enabled them to infuse the ancient and hereditary spirit"
7706,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,of the country into all that is genuine of our modern poetry. And
7707,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"even the language grew almost Irish. The soul of the country,"
7708,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"stammering its passionate grief and hatred in a strange tongue,"
7709,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,loved still to utter them in its old familiar idioms and cadences.
7710,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"Uttering them, perhaps, with more piercing earnestness, because of"
7711,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,the impediment; and winning out of the very difficulty a grace and
7712,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"a triumph."""
7713,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7714,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,How often have we wished for such a companion as this volume! Worse
7715,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"than meeting unclean beds, or drenching mists, or Cockney opinions, was"
7716,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,it to have to take the mountains with a book of Scottish ballads. They
7717,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"were glorious, to be sure, but they were not ours--they had not the"
7718,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"brown of the climate on their cheek, they spoke of places afar, and"
7719,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"ways which are not our country's ways, and hopes which were not"
7720,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"Ireland's, and their tongue was not that we first made sport and love"
7721,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,with. Yet how mountaineer without ballads any more than without a
7722,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"shillelagh? No; we took the Scots ballads, and felt our souls rubbing"
7723,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"away with envy and alienage amid their attractions; but now, Brighid,"
7724,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"be praised! we can have all Irish thoughts on Irish hills, true to them"
7725,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,"as the music, or the wind, or the sky."
7726,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,
7727,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,Happy boys! who may grow up with such ballads in your memories. Happy
7728,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,men! who will find your hearts not only doubtful but joyous in serving
7729,BALLAD POETRY OF IRELAND.,and sacrificing for the country you thus learned in childhood to love.

7740,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,Of course the first _object_ of the work we project[48] will be to make
7741,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Irish History familiar to the minds, pleasant to the ears, dear to the"
7742,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"passions, and powerful over the taste and conduct of the Irish people"
7743,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,in times to come. More _events_ could be put into a prose history.
7744,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Exact dates, subtle plots, minute connections and motives rarely appear"
7745,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"in Ballads, and for these ends the worst prose history is superior to"
7746,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,the best ballad series; but these are not the highest ends of history.
7747,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"To hallow or accurse the scenes of glory and honour, or of shame and"
7748,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"sorrow; to give to the imagination the arms, and homes, and senates,"
7749,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"and battles of other days; to rouse, and soften, and strengthen, and"
7750,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,enlarge us with the passions of great periods; to lead us into love of
7751,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"self-denial, of justice, of beauty, of valour, of generous life and"
7752,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"proud death; and to set up in our souls the memory of great men, who"
7753,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,shall then be as models and judges of our actions--these are the
7754,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"highest duties of history, and these are best taught by a Ballad"
7755,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,History.
7756,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7757,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"A Ballad History is welcome to childhood, from its rhymes, its high"
7758,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"colouring, and its aptness to memory. As we grow into boyhood, the"
7759,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"violent passions, the vague hopes, the romantic sorrow of patriot"
7760,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,ballads are in tune with our fitful and luxuriant feelings. In manhood
7761,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"we prize the condensed narrative, the grave firmness, the critical art,"
7762,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,and the political sway of ballads. And in old age they are doubly dear;
7763,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"the companions and reminders of our life, the toys and teachers of our"
7764,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,children and grand-children. Every generation finds its account in
7765,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,them. They pass from mouth to mouth like salutations; and even the
7766,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"minds which lose their words are under their influence, as one can"
7767,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,recall the starry heavens who cannot revive the form of a single
7768,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,constellation.
7769,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7770,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"In olden times all ballads were made to music, and the minstrel sang"
7771,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,them to his harp or screamed them in recitative. Thus they reached
7772,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"farther, were welcomer guests in feast and camp, and were better"
7773,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,preserved. We shall have more to say on this in speaking of our
7774,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"proposed song collection. Printing so multiplies copies of ballads, and"
7775,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"intercourse is so general, that there is less need of this adaptation"
7776,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"to music now. Moreover, it may be disputed whether the dramatic effect"
7777,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,in the more solemn ballads is not injured by lyrical forms. In such
7778,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,streaming exhortations and laments as we find in the Greek choruses and
7779,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"in the adjurations and caoines of the Irish, the breaks and parallel"
7780,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"repetitions of a song might lower the passion. Were we free to do so,"
7781,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,we could point out instances in the _Spirit of the Nation_ in which the
7782,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,rejection of song-forms seems to have been essential to the awfulness
7783,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,of the occasion.
7784,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7785,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"In pure narratives and in the gayer and more splendid, though less"
7786,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"stern ballads, the song-forms and adaptation to music are clear gains."
7787,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7788,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"In the Scotch ballads this is usual, in the English rare. We look in"
7789,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"vain through Southey's admirable ballads--""Mary the Maid of the Inn,"""
7790,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"""Jaspar,"" ""Inchcape Rock,"" ""Bishop Hatto,"" ""King Henry V. and the"
7791,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Hermit of Dreux""--for either burden, chorus, or adaptation to music. In"
7792,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"the ""Battle of Blenheim"" there is, however, an occasional burden line;"
7793,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"and in the smashing ""March to Moscow"" there is a great chorusing about--"
7794,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7795,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"""Morbleu! Parbleu!"
7796,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"What a pleasant excursion to Moscow."""
7797,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7798,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,Coleridge has some skilful repetitions and exquisite versification in
7799,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"his ""Ancient Mariner,"" ""Genevieve,"" ""Alice du Clos,"" but nowhere a"
7800,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"systematic burden. Campbell has no burdens in his finest lyric ballads,"
7801,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"though the subjects were fitted for them. The burden of the ""Exile of"
7802,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Erin"" belongs very doubtfully to him."
7803,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7804,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Macaulay's best ballad, the ""Battle of Ivry,"" is greatly aided by the"
7805,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"even burden line; but he has not repeated the experiment, though he,"
7806,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"too, makes much use of repeating lines in his Roman Lays and other"
7807,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,ballads.
7808,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7809,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"While, then, we counsel burdens in Historical Ballads, we would"
7810,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"recognise excepted cases where they may be injurious, and treat them as"
7811,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"in _no case_ essential to perfect ballad success. In songs, we would"
7812,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"almost always insist either on a chorus, verse, or a burden of some"
7813,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"sort. A burden need not be at the end of the verse; but may, with quite"
7814,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"equal success, be at the beginning or in the body of it, as may be seen"
7815,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"in the Scotch Ballads, and in some of those in the _Spirit of the"
7816,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,Nation_.
7817,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7818,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"The old Scotch and English ballads, and Lockhart's translations from"
7819,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"the Spanish, are mostly composed in one metre, though written down in"
7820,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"either of two ways. Macaulay's Roman Lays and ""Ivry"" are in this metre."
7821,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,Take an example from the last:--
7822,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7823,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"""Press where ye see my white plume shine, amid the ranks of war,"
7824,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"And be your Oriflamme to-day the helmet of Navarre."""
7825,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7826,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"In the old ballads this would be printed in four lines, of eight"
7827,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"syllables and six alternately, and rhyming only alternately, thus:--"
7828,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7829,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"""Press where ye see my white plume shine,"
7830,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Amid the ranks of war,"
7831,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,And be your Oriflamme to-day
7832,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"The helmet of Navarre."""
7833,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7834,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,So Macaulay himself prints this metre in some of his Roman Lays.
7835,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7836,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,But the student should rather avoid than seek this metre. The uniform
7837,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"old beat of eight and six is apt to fall monotonously on the ear, and"
7838,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,some of the most startling effects are lost in it. In the _Spirit of
7839,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,the Nation_ the student will find many other ballad metres. Campbell's
7840,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"metres, though new and glorious things, are terrible traps to"
7841,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"imitation, and should be warily used. The German ballads, and, still"
7842,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"more, Mr. Mangan's translations of them, contain great variety of new"
7843,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"and safe, though difficult, metres. Next in frequency to the"
7844,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"fourteen-syllable line is that in eleven syllables, such as ""Mary"
7845,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Ambree"" and ""Lochinvar""; and for a rolling brave ballad 'tis a fine"
7846,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"metre. The metre of fifteen syllables with double rhymes, (or accents)"
7847,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"in the middle, and that of thirteen, with double rhymes at the end, is"
7848,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"tolerably frequent, and the metre used by Father Prout, in his noble"
7849,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"translation of ""Duke D'Alençon,"" is admirable, and easier than it"
7850,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"seems. By the way, what a grand burden runs through that ballad:--"
7851,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7852,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"""Fools! to believe the sword could give to the children of the Rhine,"
7853,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Our Gallic fields--the land that yields the Olive and the Vine!"""
7854,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7855,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"The syllables are as in the common metre, but it has thrice the rhymes."
7856,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7857,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,We have seen great materials wasted in a struggle with a crotchety
7858,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"metre; therefore, though we counsel the invention of metres, we would"
7859,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,add that unless a metre come out racily and appropriately in the first
7860,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"couple of verses, it should be abandoned, and some of those easily"
7861,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,marked metres taken up.
7862,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7863,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"A historical ballad will commonly be narrative in its form, but not"
7864,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"necessarily so. A hymn of exultation--a call to a council, an army, or"
7865,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"a people--a prophecy--a lament--or a dramatic scene (as in Lochiel),"
7866,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"may give as much of event, costume, character, and even scenery as a"
7867,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"mere narration. The varieties of form are infinite, and it argues lack"
7868,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"of force in a writer to keep always to mere narration, though when"
7869,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,exact events are to be told that may be the best mode.
7870,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7871,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,One of the essential qualities of a good historical ballad is truth. To
7872,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"pervert history--to violate nature, in order to make a fine clatter,"
7873,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,has been the aim in too many of the ballads sent us. He who goes to
7874,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"write a historical ballad should master the main facts of the time, and"
7875,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,state them truly. It may be well for those perhaps either not to study
7876,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,or to half-forget minute circumstances until after his ballad is
7877,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"drafted out, lest he write a chronicle, not a ballad; but he will do"
7878,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"well, ere he suffers it to leave his study, to reconsider the facts of"
7879,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"the time or man, or act of which he writes, and see if he cannot add"
7880,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"force to his statements, an antique grace to his phrases, and colour to"
7881,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,his language.
7882,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7883,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,Truth and appropriateness in ballads require great knowledge and taste.
7884,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7885,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"To write an Irish historical ballad, one should know the events which"
7886,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"he would describe, and know them not merely from an isolated study of"
7887,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"his subject, but from old familiarity, which shall have associated them"
7888,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"with his tastes and passions, and connected them with other parts of"
7889,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,history. How miserable a thing is to put forward a piece of vehement
7890,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"declamation and vague description, which might be uttered of any event,"
7891,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"or by the man of any time, as a historical ballad. We have had battle"
7892,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,ballads sent us that would be as characteristic of Marathon or Waterloo
7893,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,as of Clontarf--laments that might have been uttered by a German or a
7894,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,Hindu--and romances equally true to love all the world over.
7895,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7896,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,Such historical study extends not merely to the events. A ballad writer
7897,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"should try to find the voice, colour, stature, passions, and peculiar"
7898,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"faculties of his hero--the arms, furniture, and dress of the congress,"
7899,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"or the champions, or the troops he tells of--the rites wherewith the"
7900,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"youth were married--the dead interred, and God worshipped; and the"
7901,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"architecture--previous history and pursuits (and, therefore, probable"
7902,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,ideas and phrases) of the men he describes.
7903,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7904,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Many of these things he will get in books. He should shun compilations,"
7905,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"and take up original journals, letters, state papers, statutes, and"
7906,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,cotemporary fictions and narratives as much as possible. Let him not
7907,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"much mind Leland or Curry (after he has run over them), but work like"
7908,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"fury at the Archæological Society's books--at Harris's Hibernica, at"
7909,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Lodge's Desiderata Curiosa Hibernica, at Strafford's Pacata, Spencer's"
7910,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"View, Giraldus's Narrative, Fynes Moryson's Itinerary, the Ormond"
7911,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Papers, the State Papers of Henry the Eighth, Stafford's and Cromwell's"
7912,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"and Rinuccini's Letters, and the correspondence and journals, from"
7913,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,Donald O'Neill's letter to the Pope down to Wolfe Tone's glorious
7914,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,memoirs.
7915,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7916,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"In the songs, and even their names, many a fine hint can be got; and he"
7917,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,is not likely to be a perfect Balladist of Ireland who has not felt to
7918,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,tears and laughter the deathless passions of Irish music.
7919,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7920,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,We have condemned compilations; but the ballad student may well labour
7921,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"at Ware's Antiquities. He will find in the History of British Costume,"
7922,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"published by the Useful Knowledge Society, and in the illustrated work"
7923,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"now in progress called Old England, but beyond all other books, in the"
7924,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"historical works of Thierry, most valuable materials. Nothing, not even"
7925,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"the Border Minstrelsy, Percy's Relics, the Jacobite Ballads, or the"
7926,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Archæological Tracts, can be of such service as a repeated study of the"
7927,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Norman Conquest, the Ten Years' Study, and the Merovingian Times of"
7928,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,Augustine Thierry.
7929,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7930,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"We know he has rashly stated some events on insufficient authority, and"
7931,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,drawn conclusions beyond the warrant of his promises; but there is more
7932,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"deep dramatic skill, more picturesque and coloured scenery, more"
7933,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"distinct and characteristic grouping, and more lively faith to the look"
7934,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"and spirit of the men and times and feelings of which he writes, in"

7936,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"intuition in favour of liberty, and his vindication of the ""men of '98"""
7937,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,out of the slanderous pages of Musgrave is a miracle of historical
7938,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,skill and depth of judgment.
7939,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7940,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,In the Irish Academy in Dublin there is a collection (now arranged and
7941,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,rapidly increasing) of ancient arms and utensils. Private collections
7942,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"exist in many provincial towns, especially in Ulster. Indeed, we know"
7943,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,an Orange painter in a northern village who has a finer collection of
7944,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,Irish antiquities than all of the Munster cities put together. Accurate
7945,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"observation of, and discussion on, such collections will be of vast"
7946,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,service to a writer of historical Ballads.
7947,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,
7948,A BALLAD HISTORY OF IRELAND.,"Topography is also essential to a ballad, or to any Historian. This is"

8031,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"swayed, and tells that ""a soul has come into Eire,"" and summons all the"
8032,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],Milesian tribes to battle for Ireland. But even in the seventeenth
8033,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"century, when the footing of the Norman and Saxon in Ireland was as"
8034,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"sure as that of the once-invading Milesians themselves, we find the cry"
8035,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"purely to the older Irish races, and the bounds of the nation made, not"
8036,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"by the island, but by genealogy."
8037,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],
8038,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"We may remark, in passing, that on no hypothesis did these same"
8039,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],Milesians form more than the aristocracy of ancient Ireland--a class--a
8040,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],race of conquerors.
8041,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],
8042,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],Dr. MacHale has made a noble attempt to supply this deficiency by his
8043,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],translation of Moore into Irish; but we are told that the language of
8044,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"his translation is too literary, and that the people do not relish"
8045,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],these songs. A stronger reason for their failure (if in so short a time
8046,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"their fate can be judged) is, that the originals want the idiom and"
8047,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"colour of the country, and are too subtle in thought. This remark does"
8048,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"not apply to Moore's love songs, not to some, at least, of his"
8049,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"political lyrics, and we cannot doubt that, if translated into"
8050,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"vernacular Irish, and printed as ballads, they would succeed. For the"
8051,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],present nothing better can be done than to paraphrase the _Songs of the
8052,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],Nation_ into racy and musical Irish; though a time may come when
8053,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"someone born amid the Irish tongue, reared amid Gaelic associations,"
8054,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"instructed in the state of modern Ireland, and filled with passion and"
8055,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"prophecy, shall sing the union and destiny of all the races settled on"
8056,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"Irish ground, till the vales of Munster and the cliffs of Connaught"
8057,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],ring with the words of Nationality.
8058,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],
8059,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],But whatever may be done by translation and editing for the songs of
8060,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"the Irish-speaking race, those of our English-speaking countrymen are"
8061,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"to be written. Moore, Griffin, Banim, and Callanan have written plenty"
8062,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],of songs. Those of Moore have reached the drawing rooms; but what do
8063,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"the People know even of his? Buy a ballad in any street in Ireland,"
8064,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"from the metropolis to the village, and you will find in it, perhaps,"
8065,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"some humour, some tenderness, and some sweetness of sound; but you will"
8066,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"certainly find bombast, or slander, or coarseness, united in all cases"
8067,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"with false rhythm, false rhyme, conceited imagery, black paper, and"
8068,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],blotted printing. A high class of ballads would do immense good--the
8069,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],present race demean and mislead the people as much as they stimulate
8070,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"them; for the sale of these ballads is immense, and printers in Dublin,"
8071,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"Drogheda, Cork, and Belfast live by their sale exclusively. Were an"

8073,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"on good paper, and well printed, he would make a fortune of ""halfpenny"
8074,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"ballads."""
8075,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],
8076,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"The Anglo-Irish songs, though most of the last century, are generally"
8077,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"indecent or factious. The cadets of the Munster Protestants, living"
8078,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"like garrison soldiers, drinking, racing, and dancing, wrote the one"

8099,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],shape.
8100,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],
8101,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"There is plenty, then, for the present race of Irish lyrists to do."
8102,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],They have a great heritage in the national music. It has every
8103,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],excellence and every variety. It is not needful for a writer of our
8104,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"songs to be a musician, though he will certainly gain much accuracy and"
8105,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],save much labour to others and himself by being so. Moore is a musician
8106,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"of great attainments, and Burns used to compose his songs when going"
8107,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"over, and over, and over the tune with or without words. But constantly"
8108,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],listening to the playing of Irish airs will enable any man with a
8109,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"tolerable ear, and otherwise qualified, to write words to them."
8110,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],
8111,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"Here, we would give two cautions. First--that the airs in Moore's"
8112,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"Melodies are very corrupt, and should never be used for the study of"
8113,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],Irish music. This is even more true of Lover's tunes. There is no need
8114,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"of using them, for Bunting's and Holden's collections are cheaper, and"
8115,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],contain pure settings. Secondly--that as there are hundreds of the
8116,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"finest airs to which no English words have been written, and as the"
8117,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],effect of a song is greatly increased by having one set of words always
8118,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"joined with one tune, our versifiers should carefully avoid the airs to"
8119,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"which Moore, Griffin, or any other Irishman has written even moderately"
8120,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],good words.
8121,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],
8122,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"In endeavouring to learn an air for the purpose of writing words to it,"
8123,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"the first care should, of course, be to get at its character--as gay,"
8124,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"hopeful, loving, sentimental, lively, hesitating, woeful, despairing,"
8125,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"resolute, fiery, or variable. Many Irish airs take a different"
8126,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"character when played fast or slow, lightly or strongly; but there is"
8127,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"some one mode of playing which is best of all, and the character"
8128,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],expressed by it must determine the character of the words. For nothing
8129,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"can be worse than a gay song to calm music, or massive words to a"
8130,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"delicate air; in all cases _the tune must suggest, and will suggest, to"
8131,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],the lyrist the sentiment of the words_.
8132,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],
8133,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"The tune will, of course, fix the number of lines in a verse."
8134,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],Frequently the number and order of the lines can be varied. Three
8135,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"rhymes and a fall, or couplets, or alternate rhymes, may answer the"
8136,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"same set of notes; or rhymes, if too numerous, may be got rid of by"
8137,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"making one long, instead of two short lines. Where the same notes come"
8138,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"with emphasis at the ends of musical phrases, the words should rhyme,"
8139,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],in order to secure the full effect. The doubling two lines into one is
8140,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"most convenient where the first has accents on both the last syllables,"
8141,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],for you thus escape the necessity of double rhyming. In the softer airs
8142,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],the effect of this is rather agreeable than otherwise.
8143,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],
8144,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"Talking of double rhymes, they are peculiarly fitted for strong"
8145,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"political and didactic songs, for the abstract and political words in"
8146,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"English are chiefly of Latin origin, of considerable length and"
8147,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"gravity, and have double accents. The more familiar English words"
8148,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"(which best suit most songs) contain few doubly-accented terminations,"
8149,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"and are, therefore, little fitted for double rhyming."
8150,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],
8151,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],Expletive syllables in the beginning of lines where the tune is sharp
8152,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"and gay are often an improvement, but they should never follow a double"
8153,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],rhyme.
8154,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],
8155,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"In strong and firm tunes, having a syllable for every note is a"
8156,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"perfection, though one hard to be attained without harshness, from the"
8157,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"crowd of consonants in English. With soft tunes, on the other hand, it"
8158,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],is commonly better to have in most lines two or more light notes to one
8159,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"syllable, so that the words may be dwelt on and softly sounded; but"
8160,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],where and how must be determined by the taste of the writer.
8161,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],
8162,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"The sound of the air will always show the current of thought, its"
8163,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],pauses and changes; and a nice attention and bold sympathy with these
8164,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],properties of a tune is necessary to lyrical success.
8165,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],
8166,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"A great advantage, too, of writing for existing airs is the variety of"
8167,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"metres thus gained, and the naturally greater variety of thought and"
8168,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],expression thus suggested.
8169,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],
8170,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"We have spoken, in reference to Ballads, of the use of Choruses and"
8171,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"Burdens, and said that we thought there were some Ballads which were"
8172,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"injured by them; but all songs, save (perhaps) those of desperate"
8173,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"sorrow, gain by burden lines and choruses. They are almost universal in"
8174,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],the Native Irish and Lowland Scotch. Beranger has employed them in most
8175,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"of his songs, and Moore in many of his. A chorus should, of course,"
8176,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"contain the very spirit of the song--bounding, if it be gay; fierce, if"
8177,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"it be bold; doting, if it loves. Merely repeating one verse between, or"
8178,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"at the head or tail of another, is not putting a chorus; it must be"
8179,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"_the_ verse which beats the best on your ear, and has the most echo in"
8180,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],"your heart. So, too, of burdens; they are not made merely by bringing"
8181,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],in the same words in like places. They must be marked words forcibly
8182,THE SONGS OF IRELAND.[49],brought in.

8221,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"to us for a few minutes, and when they have done to think and talk"
8222,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,again and again over what we say.
8223,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,
8224,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"If Ireland had all the elements of a nation, she might, and surely"
8225,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"would, at once assume the forms of one, and proclaim her independence."
8226,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,Wherein does she now differ from Prussia? She has a strong and compact
8227,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"territory, girt by the sea; Prussia's lands are open and flat, and"
8228,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"flung loosely through Europe, without mountain or river, breed or"

8230,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"recruitment of, and a produce able to pay, a first-rate army. Her"
8231,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"harbours, her soil, and her fisheries are not surpassed in Europe."
8232,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,
8233,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"Wherein, we ask again, does Ireland now differ from Prussia? Why can"
8234,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"Prussia wave her flag among the proudest in Europe, while Ireland is a"
8235,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,farm?
8236,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,
8237,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"It is not in the name of a kingdom, nor in the formalities of"
8238,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,independence. We could assume them to-morrow--we could assume them with
8239,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,better warrants from history and nature than Prussia holds; but the
8240,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,result of such assumption would perchance be a miserable defeat.
8241,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,
8242,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,The difference is in Knowledge. Were the offices of Prussia abolished
8243,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,to-morrow--her colleges and schools levelled--her troops disarmed and
8244,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"disbanded, she would within six months regain her whole civil and"
8245,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"military institutions. Ireland has been struggling for years, and may"
8246,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"have to struggle many more, to acquire liberty to form institutions."
8247,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,
8248,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,Whence is the difference? Knowledge!
8249,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,
8250,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"The Prussians could, at a week's notice, have their central offices at"
8251,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"full work in any village in the kingdom, so exactly known are their"
8252,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"statistics, and so general is official skill. Minds make"

8254,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,Street or the Castle would be handed in vain to the ignorants of ----
8255,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,any untaught district in Ireland. The Prussians could open their
8256,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,collegiate classes and their professional and elementary schools as
8257,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"fast as the order therefor, from any authority recognised by the"
8258,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"People, reached town after town--we can hardly in ten years get a few"
8259,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"schools open for our people, craving for knowledge as they are. The"
8260,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"Prussians could re-arm their glorious militia in a month, and"
8261,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,re-organise it in three days; for the mechanical arts are very
8262,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"generally known, military science is familiar to most of the wealthier"
8263,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"men, discipline and a soldier's skill are universal. If we had been"
8264,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"offered arms to defend Ireland by Lord Heytesbury, as the Volunteers"
8265,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"were by Lord Buckinghamshire, we would have had to seek for officers"
8266,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,and drill-sergeants--though probably we could more rapidly advance in
8267,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"arms than anything else, from the military taste and aptness for war of"
8268,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,the Irish People.
8269,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,
8270,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,Would it not be better for us to be like the Prussians than as we
8271,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"are--better to have religious squabbles unknown, education universal,"
8272,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"the People fed, and clad, and housed, and independent as becomes men;"
8273,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,the army patriotic and strong; the public offices ably administered;
8274,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,the nation honoured and powerful? Are not these to be desired and
8275,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"sought by Protestant and Catholic? Are not these things _to be done_,"
8276,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"if we are good and brave men? And is it not _plain_, from what we have"
8277,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"said, that the reason for our not being all that Prussia is, and"
8278,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"something more, is ignorance--want of civil and military and general"
8279,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,knowledge amongst all classes?
8280,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,
8281,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"This ignorance has not been our fault, but our misfortune. It was the"
8282,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"interest of our ruler to keep us ignorant, that we might be weak; and"
8283,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"she did so--first by laws, prohibiting education; then by refusing any"
8284,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"provision for it; next, by perverting it into an engine of bigotry; and"
8285,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"now, by giving it in a stunted, partial, anti-national way. Practice is"
8286,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"the great teacher, and the possession of independence is the natural"
8287,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,and best way for a People to learn all that pertains to freedom and
8288,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"happiness. Our greatest voluntary efforts, aided by the amplest"
8289,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"provincial institutions, would teach us less in a century than we would"
8290,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,learn in five years of Liberty.
8291,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,
8292,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,In insisting on education we do not argue against the value of
8293,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,_immediate independence_. _That would be our best teacher._ An Irish
8294,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,Government and a national ambition would be to our minds as soft rains
8295,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,and rich sun to a growing crop. But we insist on education for the
8296,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"People, whether we get it from the Government or give it to themselves"
8297,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"as a round-about, and yet the only, means of getting strength enough to"
8298,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,gain freedom.
8299,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,
8300,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"Do our readers understand this? Is what we have said _clear_ to _you_,"
8301,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"reader!--whether you are a shopkeeper or a lawyer, a farmer or a"
8302,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"doctor? If not, read it over again, for it is your own fault if it be"
8303,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"not clear. If you now know our meaning, you must feel that it is your"
8304,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"duty to your family and to yourself, to your country and to God, to"
8305,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"_act_ upon it, to go and remove some of that ignorance which makes you"

8308,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"All of us have much to learn, but some of us have much to teach."
8309,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,
8310,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"To those who, from superior energy and ability, can teach the People,"
8311,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,we now address ourselves.
8312,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,
8313,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"We have often before and shall often again repeat, that the majority of"
8314,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"our population can neither read nor write, and therefore that from the"
8315,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,small minority must come those fitted to be of any civil or military
8316,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"use beyond the lowest rank. The People may be and are honest, brave,"
8317,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"and intelligent; but a man could as well dig with his hands as govern,"
8318,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"or teach, or lead without the elements of Knowledge."
8319,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,
8320,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"This however, is a defect which time and the National Schools must"
8321,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,cure; and the duty of the class to which we speak is to urge the

8323,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"and occasionally to observe and report, either directly or through the"
8324,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"Press, whether the admirable rules of the Board are attended to. In"
8325,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"most cases, too, the expenditure of a pound-note and a little time and"
8326,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,advice would give the children of a school that instruction in national
8327,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,history and in statistics so shamefully omitted by the Board. Reader!
8328,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,will you do this?
8329,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,
8330,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"Then of the three hundred Repeal Reading-rooms we know that some, and"
8331,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"fear that many, are ill-managed, have few or no books, and are mere"
8332,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,gossiping-rooms. Such a room is useless; such a room is a disgrace to
8333,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,its members and their educated neighbours. The expense having been gone
8334,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"to of getting a room, it only remains for the members to establish"
8335,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"fixed rules, and they will be supplied with the Association Reports"
8336,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"(political reading enough for them), and it will be the plain duty of"
8337,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,the Repeal Wardens to bring to such a room the newspapers supplied by
8338,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,the Association. If such a body continue and give proofs of being in
8339,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"earnest, the Repeal Association will aid it by gifts of books, maps,"
8340,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"etc., and thus a library, the centre of knowledge and nursery of useful"
8341,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"and strong minds, will be made in that district. So miserably off is"
8342,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"the country for books, that we have it before us on some authority that"
8343,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,there are _ten counties in Ireland without a single book-seller in
8344,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,them_. We blush for the fact; it is a disgrace to us; but we must have
8345,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,no lying or flinching. There is the hard fact; let us face it like men
8346,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,who are able for a difficulty--not as children putting their heads
8347,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,under the clothes when there is danger. Reader! cannot you do something
8348,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"to remedy this great, this disabling misery of Ireland? Will not you"
8349,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"_now_ try to get up a Repeal Reading-room, and when one is established"
8350,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"get for it good rules, books from the Association, and make it a centre"
8351,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,of thought and power?
8352,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,
8353,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,These are but some of the ways in which such service can be done by the
8354,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,more for the less educated. They have other duties often pointed out by
8355,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,us. They can sustain and advance the different societies for promoting
8356,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"agriculture, manufactures, art, and literature in Dublin and the"
8357,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,country. They can set on foot and guide the establishment of Temperance
8358,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"Bands, and Mechanics' Institutes, and Mutual Instruction Societies."
8359,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,They can give advice and facilities for improvement to young men of
8360,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"promise; and they can make their circles studious, refined, and"
8361,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"ambitious, instead of being, like too many in Ireland, ignorant,"
8362,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"coarse, and lazy. The cheapness of books is now such that even Irish"
8363,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,poverty is no excuse for Irish ignorance--that ignorance which
8364,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,"prostrates us before England. We must help ourselves, and therefore we"
8365,INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION.,must educate ourselves.

8370,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,FOREIGN TRAVEL.
8371,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,
8372,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,
8373,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,We lately strove to induce our wealthier countrymen to explore Ireland
8374,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,before they left her shores in search of the beautiful and curious. We
8375,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"bid the economist search our towns and farms, our decayed manufactures,"
8376,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"and improving tillage. Waving our shillelagh, we shouted the cragsman"
8377,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"to Glenmalure and Carn Tual, and Achill and Slieve League. Manuscript"
8378,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"in hand, we pointed the antiquary to the hundred abbeys of North"
8379,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"Munster, the castles of the Pale, the palaces and sepulchres of"
8380,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"Dunalin, Aileach, Rath Croghan, and Loughcrew, and we whispered to our"
8381,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"countrywomen that the sun rose grandly on Adragool, that the moon was"
8382,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"soft on Lough Erne (""The Rural Venice""), and that the Nore and"
8383,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,Blackwater ran by castled crags like their sweet voices over old songs.
8384,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,
8385,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"But there are some who had not waited for our call, but had dutifully"
8386,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"grown up amid the sights and sounds of Ireland, and knew the yellow"
8387,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"fields of Tipperary, and the crash of Moher's wave, and the basalt"
8388,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"barriers of Antrim, and the moan or frown of Wexford over the graves of"
8389,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"'98, and there are others not yet sufficiently educated to prize home"
8390,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"excellence. To such, then, and to all our brethren and sisters going"
8391,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"abroad, we have to say a friendly word."
8392,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,
8393,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"We shall presume them to have visited London, Woolwich, the factories"
8394,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"of Lancashire and Warwick, and to have seen the Cumberland lakes, and"
8395,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"therefore to have seen all worth seeing in England, and that they are"
8396,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,bound for somewhere else. For a pedestrian not rich there is Wales--the
8397,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"soft vales of the far North and South Clwyd, and the Wye and Llanrwst,"
8398,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"and the central mountain groups of Snowdon, and still finer of Cader"
8399,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,Idris. But if he go there we pray him not to return without having
8400,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"heard and, so far as he could, noted down a few airs from the harp and"
8401,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"cruit, collected specimens of the plants and minerals of Wales for the"
8402,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"museum (existing or to be) of his native town, studied the statistics"
8403,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"of their great iron works or their little home-weaving; nor, if he has"
8404,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"had the sense and spirit to take a Welsh and an Irish vocabulary,"
8405,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"without some observations on the disputed analogy of the two languages,"
8406,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"and how far it exists in general terms, as it certainly does in names"
8407,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"of places. By the way, we warn him that he will know little of the"
8408,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"peasantry, and come home in the dark about Rebecca, unless he can speak"
8409,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,Welsh. The Welsh have been truer to their language than we were to
8410,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,ours; their clergy ministered in it; their people refused their tongues
8411,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"to the Saxon as if 'twere poison; and even their nobles, though tempted"
8412,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"by England, welcomed the bard who lamented the defeat of Rhuddlan, and"
8413,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,gloried in the frequent triumphs of Glendower.
8414,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,
8415,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,But let us rather classify pursuits than countries.
8416,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,
8417,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,We want the Irish who go abroad to bring something back besides the
8418,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"weary tale of the Louvre and Munich, and the cliffs of the Rhine, and"
8419,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,the soft airs of Italy. We have heard of a patriot adventurer who
8420,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,carried a handful of his native soil through the world. We want our
8421,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"friends to carry a purpose for Ireland in their hearts, to study other"
8422,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"lands wisely, and to bring back all knowledge for the sustenance and"
8423,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,decoration of their dear home.
8424,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,
8425,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,How pleasantly and profitably for the traveller this can be done. There
8426,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"is no taste but may be interested, no capacity but can be matched, no"
8427,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"country but can be made tributary to our own. The historian, the"
8428,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"linguist, the farmer, the economist, the musician, the statesman, and"
8429,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,the man of science can equally augment their pleasure and make it
8430,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,minister to Ireland.
8431,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,
8432,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"Is a man curious upon our language? He can (not unread in Neilson, nor"
8433,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,unaccompanied by O'Reilly's Dictionary) trace how far the Celtic words
8434,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"mixed in the classical French, or in the patois of Bretagne or Gascony,"
8435,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"coincide with the Irish; he can search in the mountains of North Spain,"
8436,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,whether in proper names or country words there be any analogy to the
8437,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,Gaelic of the opposite coast of Ireland.
8438,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,
8439,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"The proper names are the most permanent, and if there be any truth in"
8440,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"Sir William Betham's theories, the names of many a hill and stream in"
8441,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"Tuscany, North Africa, and Syria ought to be traceable to an Irish"
8442,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,root. Nor need this language-search be limited to the south. Beginning
8443,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"at the Isle of Man, up by Cumberland (the kingdom of Strath Clyde),"
8444,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"through Scotland, Denmark, Norway, to Ireland, the constant intercourse"
8445,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"in trade and war with Ireland, and in many instances the early"
8446,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"occupation by a Celtic race, must have left indelible marks in the"
8447,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"local names, if not the traditions, of the country. To the tourist in"
8448,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,France we particularly recommend a close study of the _History of the
8449,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"Gauls_, by Amadeus Thierry."
8450,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,
8451,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"The student of our ecclesiastical history, whether he hold with Dr."
8452,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"Smiles that the Irish Church was independent, or with Dr. Miley, that"
8453,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"it paid allegiance to Rome, may delight in following the tracks of the"
8454,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"Irish saints, from Iona of the Culdees to Luxieu and Boia (founded by"
8455,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"Columbanus), and St. Gall, founded by an Irishman of that name. Rumold"
8456,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"can be heard of in Mechlin, Albhuin in Saxony, Kilian in Bavaria,"
8457,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"Fursey in Peronne, and in far Tarentum the traveller will find more"
8458,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"than one trace of the reformer of that city--the Irishman, St."
8459,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"Cathaldus. We cannot suppose that any man will stray from Stackallen,"
8460,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"or Maynooth at least, without keeping this purpose in mind, nor would"
8461,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,it misbecome a divine from that Trinity College of which Ussher was a
8462,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,first Fellow.
8463,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,
8464,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,Our military history could also receive much illustration from Irish
8465,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,travellers going with some previous knowledge and studying the
8466,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"traditions and ground, and using the libraries in the neighbourhood of"
8467,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,those places where Irishmen fought. Not to go back to the Irish who (if
8468,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,we believe O'Halloran) stormed the Roman Capital as the allies of
8469,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"Brennus of Gaul, nor insisting upon too minute a search for that Alpine"
8470,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"valley where, says MacGeoghegan, they still have a tradition of Dathy's"
8471,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"death by lightning, there are plenty of places worth investigating in"
8472,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"connection with Irish military history. In Scotland, for example,"
8473,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,'twere worth while tracking the march of Alaster MacDomhnall and his
8474,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"1,500 Antrim men from their first landing at Ardnamurchan through"
8475,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"Tippermiur, Aberdeen, Fivy, Inverlochy, and Aulderne, to"
8476,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"Kilsyth--victories, won by Irish soldiers and chiefs, given to them by"
8477,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"tradition, as even Scott admits, though he tries to displace its value"
8478,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"for Montrose's sake, and given to them by the highest cotemporary"
8479,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,authorities--such as the Ormond papers.
8480,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,
8481,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"Then there is the Irish Brigade. From Almanza to Fontenoy, from"
8482,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"Ramillies to Cremona, we have the names of their achievements, but the"
8483,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,register of them is in the libraries and war offices and private papers
8484,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"of France, and Spain, and Austria, and Savoy. A set of visits to Irish"
8485,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"battle-fields abroad, illustrated from the manuscripts of Paris,"
8486,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"Vienna, and Madrid, would be a welcomer book than the reiterated"
8487,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"assurances that the Rhone was rapid, the Alps high, and Florence rich"
8488,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"in sculpture, wherewith we have been dinned."
8489,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,
8490,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,We have no lives of our most illustrious Irish generals in foreign
8491,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"services--Marshal Brown, the Lacys, Montgomery of Donegal, the rival of"
8492,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,Washington; and yet the materials must exist in the offices and
8493,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"libraries of Austria, Russia, and America."
8494,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,
8495,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"Talking of libraries, there is one labour in particular we wish our"
8496,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"countrymen to undertake. The constant emigration of the princes,"
8497,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"nobles, and ecclesiastics of Ireland, from the Reformation downwards,"
8498,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,scattered through the Continent many of our choicest collections. The
8499,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,manuscripts from these have been dispersed by gift and sale among
8500,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"hundreds of foreign libraries. The Escurial, Vienna, Rome, Paris, and"
8501,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"Copenhagen are said to be particularly rich in them, and it cannot be"
8502,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"doubted that in every considerable library (religious, official, or"
8503,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,private) on the Continent some MSS. valuable to Ireland would be found.
8504,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"In many cases these could be purchased, in some copied, in all listed."
8505,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,The last is the most practical and essential labour. It would check and
8506,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"guide our inquiries now, and would prepare for the better day, when we"
8507,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,can negotiate the restoration of our old muniments from the governments
8508,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,of Europe.
8509,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,
8510,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"A study of the monuments and museums throughout France, Spain, Italy,"
8511,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"and Scandinavia, in reference to the forts, tombs, altars, and weapons"
8512,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"of ancient Ireland, would make a summer pleasant and profitable."
8513,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,
8514,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,But we would not limit men to the study of the past.
8515,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,
8516,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"Our agriculture is defective, and our tenures are abominable. It were"
8517,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,well worth the attention of the travelling members of the Irish
8518,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,Agricultural Society to bring home accurate written accounts of the
8519,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"tenures of land, the breeds of cattle, draining, rotation, crops,"
8520,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"manures, and farm-houses, from Belgium or Norway, Tuscany or Prussia."
8521,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,
8522,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,Our mineral resources and water-power are unused. A collection of
8523,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"models or drawings, or descriptions of the mining, quarrying, and"
8524,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"hydraulic works of Germany, England, or France, might be found most"
8525,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"useful for the Irish capitalist who made it, and for his country which"
8526,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"so needs instruction. Besides, even though many of these things be"
8527,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"described already, yet how much more vivid and practical were the"
8528,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,knowledge to be got from observation.
8529,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,
8530,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"Our fine or useful arts are rude or decayed, and our industrial and"
8531,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"general education very inferior. The schools and galleries, museums and"
8532,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,educational systems of Germany deserve the closest examination with
8533,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"reference to the knowledge and taste required in Ireland, and the means"
8534,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"of giving them. One second-rate book of such observations, with special"
8535,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"reference to Ireland, were worth many greater performances unapplied to"
8536,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,the means and need of our country.
8537,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,
8538,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"Ireland wants all these things. Before this generation dies, it must"
8539,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"have made Ireland's rivers navigable, and its hundred harbours secure"
8540,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"with beacon and pier, and thronged with seamen educated in naval"
8541,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"schools, and familiar with every rig and every ocean. Arigna must be"
8542,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"pierced with shafts, and Bonmahon flaming with smelting-houses. Our"
8543,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"bogs must have become turf-factories, where fuel will be husbanded, and"
8544,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"prepared for the smelting-house. Our coal must move a thousand engines,"
8545,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,our rivers ten thousand wheels.
8546,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,
8547,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,Our young artisans must be familiar with the arts of design and the
8548,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,natural sciences connected with their trade; and so of our farmers; and
8549,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"both should, beside, have that general information which refines and"
8550,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,expands the minds--that knowledge of Irish history and statistics that
8551,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"makes it national, and those accomplishments and sports which make"
8552,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,leisure profitable and home joyous.
8553,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,
8554,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"Our cities must be stately with sculpture, pictures, and buildings, and"
8555,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,our fields glorious with peaceful abundance.
8556,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,
8557,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,But this is an Utopia! Is it? No; but the practicable object of those
8558,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"who know our resources! To seek it is the solemn, unavoidable duty of"
8559,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"every Irishman. Whether, then, oh reader, you spend this or any coming"
8560,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,"season abroad or at home, do not forget for a day how much should be"
8561,FOREIGN TRAVEL.,done for Ireland.

9109,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.
9110,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,
9111,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,
9112,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"The British Parliament has refused to redress our wrongs, or even to"
9113,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,inquire into them. For five long nights were they compelled to listen
9114,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"to arguments, facts, and principles proving that we were sorely"
9115,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,oppressed. They did not deny the facts--they did not refute the
9116,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,reasoning--they did not undermine the principles--but they would not
9117,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,try to right us.
9118,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,
9119,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"""We inherit the right of hatred for six centuries of oppression; what"
9120,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"will you do to prove your repentance, and propitiate our revenge?""--and"
9121,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"the answer is, ""That's an old story, we wish to hear no more of it."""
9122,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,
9123,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"Legislature of Britain, you shall hear more of it!"
9124,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,
9125,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,The growing race of Irishmen are the first generation of freemen which
9126,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,Ireland nursed these three centuries. The national schools may teach
9127,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"them only the dry elements of knowledge adulterated with Anglicism, and"
9128,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"Trinity College may teach them bigotry, along with graceful lore and"
9129,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,strong science; but there are other schools at work. There is a
9130,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"national art, and there is an Irish literature growing up. Day after"
9131,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,day the choice of the young men discover that genius needs a country to
9132,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,honour and be loved by. The Irish Press is beginning to teach the
9133,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"People to know themselves and their history; to know other nations, and"
9134,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"to feel the rights and duties of citizens. The agitation, whose surges"
9135,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"sweep through every nook of the island, converts all that the People"
9136,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"learn to national uses; nothing is lost, nothing is adverse; neutrality"
9137,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"is help, and all power is converted into power for Ireland."
9138,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,
9139,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,Ireland is changing the loose tradition of her wrongs into history and
9140,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"ballad; and though justice, repentance, or retribution may make her"
9141,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"cease to need vengeance, she will immortally remember her bondage, her"
9142,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"struggles, her glories, and her disasters. Till her suffering ceases"
9143,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,that remembrance will rouse her passions and nerve her arm. May she not
9144,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"forgive till she is no longer oppressed; and when she forgives, may she"
9145,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,never forget!
9146,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,
9147,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,Why need we repeat the tale of present wretchedness? Seven millions and
9148,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"a half of us are Presbyterians and Catholics, and our whole"
9149,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,ecclesiastical funds go to the gorgeous support of the Clergy of the
9150,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"remaining 800,000, who are Episcopalians. Where else on _earth_ does a"
9151,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,similar injury and dishonour exist? Nowhere; 'twas confessed it existed
9152,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"nowhere. Would it weaken the empire to abolish this? Confessedly not,"
9153,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,but would give it some chance of holding together. Would it injure
9154,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"Protestantism? You say not. Idle wealth is fatal to a Church, and"
9155,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,supremacy bears out every proud and generous convert. Why is it
9156,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"maintained? The answer is directly given--""England (that is, the"
9157,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"English aristocracy) is bigoted,"" and no Ministry dare give you"
9158,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"redress. These are the very words of Captain Rous, the Tory member for"
9159,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"Westminster, and the whole House assented to the fact. If you cannot"
9160,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"redress--if you will not go into inquiry, lest this redress, so needed"
9161,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"by us, should be fatal to your selfish power, then loose your hold of"
9162,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"us, and we will redress ourselves; and we will do so with less injury"
9163,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"to any class than you possibly could, for a free nation may be"
9164,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,generous--a struggling one will not and ought not to be so.
9165,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,
9166,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,We are most dishonestly taxed for _your_ debts; the fact was not
9167,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,denied--an ominous silence declared that not a halfpenny of that mighty
9168,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,mortgage would be taken off our shoulders.
9169,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,
9170,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"You raise five millions a year from us, and you spend it on English"
9171,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"commissioners, English dockyards, English museums, English ambition,"
9172,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"and English pleasures. With an enormous taxation, our public offices"
9173,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"have been removed to London, and you threaten to remove our Courts of"
9174,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"Justice, and our Lord Lieutenancy, the poor trapping of old nationhood."
9175,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"We have no arsenals, no public employment here; our literary,"
9176,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"scientific, and charitable institutions, so bountifully endowed by a"
9177,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"Native Legislature, you have forced away, till, out of that enormous"
9178,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"surplus revenue raised here, not £10,000 a year comes back for such"
9179,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"purposes, while you have heaped hundred upon hundred thousand into the"
9180,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,lap of every English institution. For National Education you dribble
9181,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"out £50,000 a year--not enough for our smallest province. Will you"
9182,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"redress these things? No, but you boast of your liberality in giving us"
9183,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,anything.
9184,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,
9185,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"""Oh, but you are not overtaxed,"" says Peel; ""see, your Post-office"
9186,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"produces nothing to the revenue."" Ay, Sir, our Post-office, which"
9187,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"levies the same rates as the English Post-office, produces nothing;"
9188,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,Ireland is too poor to make even a penny-postage pay its own cost. No
9189,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"stronger mark of a stagnant trade could be adduced. ""And then we"
9190,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"lowered your spirit duty."" Yes you did, because it brought in less than"
9191,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"the lower duty. What single tax did you take off, except when it had"
9192,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"been raised so high, or the country had declined so low, that it ceased"
9193,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,to be productive? You increased our taxation up to the end of the war
9194,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"two and a half times more rapidly than you did your own, and you"
9195,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,diminished our taxation after the war thirty times less rapidly.
9196,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,
9197,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"You have a fleet of steamers now--you had none in 1817, says some"
9198,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"pattern of English Senators, whose constituents are bound to subscribe"
9199,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,a few school-books for him if they mean to continue him as their
9200,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,delegate.
9201,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,
9202,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,And my Lord Eliot says our exports and imports have increased. We wish
9203,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,your Lordship would have separate accounts kept that we might know how
9204,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"much. But they _have_ increased--ay, they have; and they are"
9205,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,provisions. And our population has increased: and when we had one-half
9206,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,the number of People to feed we sent out a tenth of the provisions we
9207,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"send away now. This is ruin, not prosperity. We had weavers,"
9208,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"iron-workers, glass-makers, and fifty other flourishing trades. They"
9209,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"sold their goods to Irishmen in exchange for beef and mutton, and"
9210,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"bread, and bacon, and potatoes. The Irish provisions were not"
9211,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,exported--they were eaten in Ireland. They are exported now--for Irish
9212,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"artisans, without work, must live on the refuse of the soil, and Irish"
9213,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,peasants must eat lumpers or starve. Part of the exports go to buy rags
9214,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"and farming tools, which once went for clothes and all other goods to"
9215,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"Irish operatives, and the rest goes to raise money to pay absentee"
9216,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,rents and imperial taxes. Will you tax our absentees? Will you employ
9217,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"our artisans? Will you abate your taxes, or spend them among us? No;"
9218,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,you refuse redress--you refuse inquiry.
9219,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,
9220,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,Your conquests and confiscations have given us land tenures alien to
9221,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,the country and deadly to the peasant. Will you interfere in property
9222,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"to save him, as you interfered to oppress him? You hint that you might"
9223,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"inquire, but you only offered redress in an Arms' Bill--to prostrate"
9224,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"the poor man, to violate the sanctity of his home, to brand him, and"
9225,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,leave him at the mercy of his local tyrant.
9226,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,
9227,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"Will you equalise the franchise, and admit us, in proportion to our"
9228,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"numbers, into your Senate, and let us try there for redress? You may"
9229,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"inquire, perhaps, some other time; if much pressed, you may consider"
9230,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,some increase of the franchise--you decline to open the representation.
9231,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,
9232,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"And if England will do none of these things, will she allow us, for"
9233,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"good or ill, to govern ourselves, and see if we cannot redress our own"
9234,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"griefs? ""No, never, never,"" she says, ""though all Ireland cried for"
9235,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,it--never! Her fields shall be manured with the shattered limbs of her
9236,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"sons, and her hearths quenched in their blood; but never, while England"
9237,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"has a ship or a soldier, shall Ireland be free."""
9238,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,
9239,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,And this is your answer? We shall see--we shall see!
9240,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,
9241,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"And now, Englishmen, listen to us! Though you were to-morrow to give us"
9242,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"the best tenures on earth--though you were to equalise Presbyterian,"
9243,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"Catholic, and Episcopalian--though you were to give us the amplest"
9244,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,representation in your Senate--though you were to restore our
9245,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"absentees, disencumber us of your debt, and redress every one of our"
9246,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"fiscal wrongs--and though, in addition to all this, you plundered the"
9247,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"treasuries of the world to lay gold at our feet, and exhausted the"
9248,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,resources of your genius to do us worship and honour--still we tell
9249,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"you--we tell you, in the names of liberty and country--we tell you, in"
9250,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"the name of enthusiastic hearts, thoughtful souls, and fearless"
9251,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"spirits--we tell you, by the past, the present and the future, we would"
9252,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"spurn your gifts, if the condition were that Ireland should remain a"
9253,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"province. We tell you, and all whom it may concern, come what"
9254,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"may--bribery or deceit, justice, policy, or war--we tell you, in the"
9255,NO REDRESS--NO INQUIRY.,"name of Ireland, that Ireland shall be a Nation!"

9261,THE RIGHT ROAD.,
9262,THE RIGHT ROAD.,
9263,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"By the People the People must be righted. Disunion, and sloth, and"
9264,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"meanness enslaved them. Combination, calm pride, and ceaseless labour"
9265,THE RIGHT ROAD.,must set them loose. Let them not trust to the blunders of their
9266,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"enemies, or the miracles of their chiefs--trust nothing, men of"
9267,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"Ireland, but the deep resolve of your own hearts."
9268,THE RIGHT ROAD.,
9269,THE RIGHT ROAD.,As well might you leave the fairies to plough your land or the idle
9270,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"winds to sow it, as sit down and wait for freedom."
9271,THE RIGHT ROAD.,
9272,THE RIGHT ROAD.,You are on the right road.
9273,THE RIGHT ROAD.,
9274,THE RIGHT ROAD.,The Repeal Year is over--what then?--Call next year the Repeal Year if
9275,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"you have a fancy for names; and if that, too, searches your"
9276,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"fetter-sores with its December blast, work the next year, and the next,"
9277,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"and the next. Cease not till all is done. If you sleep, now that you"
9278,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"have climbed so far, you may never wake again."
9279,THE RIGHT ROAD.,
9280,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"Abandon or nod over your task, and the foreign minister will treat you"
9281,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"as mad, and tie you down, or as idiotic, and give you sugar plums and"
9282,THE RIGHT ROAD.,stripes. Every man with a spark of pride and manhood would leave you to
9283,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"bear alone the scorn of the world, and from father to son you would"
9284,THE RIGHT ROAD.,live a race of ragged serfs till God in his mercy should destroy the
9285,THE RIGHT ROAD.,People and the soil.
9286,THE RIGHT ROAD.,
9287,THE RIGHT ROAD.,You are on the right road. You don't want to go to war. Your greatest
9288,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"leader objects, on principle, to all war for liberty. All your friends,"
9289,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"even those who think liberty well worth a sea of blood, agree with him"
9290,THE RIGHT ROAD.,that it is neither needful nor politic for you to embark in a war with
9291,THE RIGHT ROAD.,your oppressor. It is not that they doubt your courage nor resources--it
9292,THE RIGHT ROAD.,is not that they distrust your allies--but it is that they _know_ you
9293,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"can succeed without a single skirmish, and therefore he who harms"
9294,THE RIGHT ROAD.,person or property in seeking Repeal is criminal to his country.
9295,THE RIGHT ROAD.,
9296,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"But if they preach peace loudly, they preach perseverance with still"
9297,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"greater emphasis. It is the universal creed of all Liberals, that"
9298,THE RIGHT ROAD.,_anything_ were better than retreat. One of the most moderate of
9299,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"the Whigs said to us yesterday: ""I would rather walk at O'Connell's"
9300,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"funeral than witness his submission."" And he said well. Death is no"
9301,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"evil, and dying is but a moment's pang. There is no greater sign of a"
9302,THE RIGHT ROAD.,pampered and brutish spirit in a man than to wince at the foot-sound of
9303,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"death. Death is the refuge of the wronged, the opiate of the restless,"
9304,THE RIGHT ROAD.,the mother's or the lover's breast to the bruised and disappointed; it
9305,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"is the sure retreat of the persecuted, and the temple-gate of the"
9306,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"loving, and pious, and brave. When all else leaves us, it is faithful."
9307,THE RIGHT ROAD.,But where are we wandering to pluck garlands from the tomb?
9308,THE RIGHT ROAD.,
9309,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"Retreat would bring us the woes of war, without its chances or its"
9310,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"pride. The enemy, elate at our discomfiture, would press upon our rear."
9311,THE RIGHT ROAD.,The landlord would use every privilege till he had reduced his farms to
9312,THE RIGHT ROAD.,insurgentless pastures. The minister would rush in and tear away the
9313,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"last root of nationality. The peasant, finding his long-promised hope"
9314,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"of freedom and security by moral means gone, and left unled to his own"
9315,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"impulses, would league with his neighbour serfs, and ruin others, in"
9316,THE RIGHT ROAD.,the vain hope of redressing himself. The day would be dark with
9317,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"tyranny, and the night red with vengeance. The military triumph of the"
9318,THE RIGHT ROAD.,rack-renter or the Whiteboy would be the happiest issue of the strife.
9319,THE RIGHT ROAD.,
9320,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"If the People ought neither spring into war, nor fall through confusion"

9323,THE RIGHT ROAD.,looking back.
9324,THE RIGHT ROAD.,
9325,THE RIGHT ROAD.,The Repeal organisation enables the People to act together. It is the
9326,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"bark of the tree, guarding it and binding it. It is the cause of our"
9327,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"unanimity; for where else has a party, so large as the Irish Repealers,"
9328,THE RIGHT ROAD.,worked without internal squabbles? It is the secret of our discipline.
9329,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"How else, but by the instant action of the Association on the whole"
9330,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"mass of the People, through the Repeal Press and the Repeal Wardens,"
9331,THE RIGHT ROAD.,could our huge meetings have been assembled or been brought
9332,THE RIGHT ROAD.,together?--how else could they have been separated in quiet?--how else
9333,THE RIGHT ROAD.,could the People have been induced to continue their subscriptions
9334,THE RIGHT ROAD.,month after month and year after year?
9335,THE RIGHT ROAD.,
9336,THE RIGHT ROAD.,An ignorant or unorganised People would soon have tired of the constant
9337,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"subscriptions and meetings, and have broken into disorder or sunk into"
9338,THE RIGHT ROAD.,apathy.
9339,THE RIGHT ROAD.,
9340,THE RIGHT ROAD.,He is a long-sighted and sober-minded man that lays out money on a
9341,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"complex yet safe speculation, or lays it by for an evil day. That is a"
9342,THE RIGHT ROAD.,People having political wisdom which denies itself some present
9343,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"indulgence for a future good. It had been pleasanter, for some at least"
9344,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"of the People, to have spent in eating or clothing the shilling they"
9345,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"sent to the Repeal Association, just as six years ago they found it"
9346,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"pleasanter to spend the shilling, or the penny, or the pound, on the"
9347,THE RIGHT ROAD.,whiskey shop. But the same self-denying and far-seeing resolve which
9348,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"enabled them to resign drink for food, and books, and clothing, induced"
9349,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"them to postpone some of these solid comforts to attend meetings, and"
9350,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"to give money, in order to win, at some future time, fixed holdings,"
9351,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"trade, strength, and liberty."
9352,THE RIGHT ROAD.,
9353,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"The People, if they would achieve their aim, must continue their"
9354,THE RIGHT ROAD.,exertions.
9355,THE RIGHT ROAD.,
9356,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"It will not do to say, wait till the trials are over. The rate of the"
9357,THE RIGHT ROAD.,trials will not determine Repeal.
9358,THE RIGHT ROAD.,
9359,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"The conviction, imprisonment, or death of their present leaders will"
9360,THE RIGHT ROAD.,not crush it. There are those ready to fill the vacancies in the
9361,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"column, and to die too. The rudest and the humblest in the land would"
9362,THE RIGHT ROAD.,grow into an inspired hero were leader after leader to advance and
9363,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"fall. Victory would be the religion of the country, and by one means or"
9364,THE RIGHT ROAD.,other it would triumph. A stronger spirit than his who died issues from
9365,THE RIGHT ROAD.,the martyr's coffin.
9366,THE RIGHT ROAD.,
9367,THE RIGHT ROAD.,Nor would the success of the accused carry Repeal.
9368,THE RIGHT ROAD.,
9369,THE RIGHT ROAD.,It would embarrass the minister--it would gain time--it would give us
9370,THE RIGHT ROAD.,another chance for peaceful justice.
9371,THE RIGHT ROAD.,
9372,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"But the Queen's Bench is not the imperial Parliament, nor is the"
9373,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"Traversers' plea of ""not guilty"" a bill to overturn the Union, and"
9374,THE RIGHT ROAD.,construct Irish independence on its ruins.
9375,THE RIGHT ROAD.,
9376,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"To win by peace they must use all the resources of peace, as they have"
9377,THE RIGHT ROAD.,done hitherto.
9378,THE RIGHT ROAD.,
9379,THE RIGHT ROAD.,Is there any parish wherein there are no Repeal Wardens active every
9380,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"week in collecting money, distributing cards, tracts, and newspapers?"
9381,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"Let that parish meet to-morrow or to-morrow week, appoint _active_"
9382,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"Wardens, send up its subscriptions, and get down its cards, papers, and"
9383,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"tracts, week after week, till the year goes round or till Repeal is"
9384,THE RIGHT ROAD.,carried.
9385,THE RIGHT ROAD.,
9386,THE RIGHT ROAD.,Is there any town or district which has not a Temperance Band and
9387,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"Reading-room? If there be, let that town or district meet at once, and"
9388,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"subscribe for instruments, music, and a teacher; let the members meet,"
9389,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"and read, and discuss, and qualify themselves by union, study, and"
9390,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"political information to act as citizens, whether their duty lead them"
9391,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"to the public assembly, the hustings, or the hill-side. By acting thus,"
9392,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"and not by listening for news about trials, the People have advanced"
9393,THE RIGHT ROAD.,from mouldering slaves into a threatening and united People; continuing
9394,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"to act thus, they will become a triumphant nation, spite of fortified"
9395,THE RIGHT ROAD.,"barracks, Wellington, Peel, and England. They are in the right road;"

9401,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.
9402,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,
9403,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,
9404,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,Our history contains reasons for our extending the Foreign Policy of
9405,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,Ireland. This we tried to develop some months back.
9406,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,
9407,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,The partial successes of the wars of the sixteenth and seventeenth
9408,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"centuries, from Hugh O'Neill to James the Second, were in no slight"
9409,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,degree owing to the arms and auxiliary troops of Spain and France.
9410,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,
9411,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,Our yet more complete triumphs in the political conflicts of the
9412,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,eighteenth and nineteenth centuries owed still more to our foreign
9413,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,connections--witness the influence of the American war on the creation
9414,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"of the Volunteers, the effect of the battle of Jemappes, and of the"
9415,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"French Fraternity of Ulster on the Toleration Act of 1793, and how much"
9416,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"the presence of American money, and the fear of French interference,"
9417,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,hastened the Emancipation Act of 1829.
9418,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,
9419,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"With reference to this last period, we may state that such an effect"
9420,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,had the articles published in _l'Etoile_ on Ireland that Canning
9421,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"wrote a remonstrance to M. de Villele, asking him ""was it intended that"
9422,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"the war of pens should bring on one of swords."" The remonstrance was"
9423,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"unavailing--the French sympathy for Ireland increased, and other"
9424,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,offices than newspaper offices began to brush up their information on
9425,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"Ireland. But arms yielded to the gown, and the maps and statistics of"
9426,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,Ireland never left the War Office of France.
9427,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,
9428,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,But our own history is not the only advocate for a Foreign Policy for
9429,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,Ireland.
9430,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,
9431,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"Foreign alliances have ever stood among the pillars of national power,"
9432,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"along with virtue, wise laws, settled customs, military organisations,"
9433,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"and naval position. Advice, countenance, direct help, are secured by"
9434,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,old and generous alliances. Thus the alliance of Prussia carried
9435,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"England through the wars of the eighteenth century, the alliance of"
9436,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"France rescued the wavering fortunes of America, the alliance of"
9437,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"Austria maintains Turkey against Russia, and so in a thousand instances"
9438,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,beside.
9439,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,
9440,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"A People known and regarded abroad will be more dignified, more"
9441,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"consistent, and more proud in all its acts. Fame is to national manners"
9442,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,little less than virtue to national morals. A nation with a high and
9443,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,notorious character to sustain will be more stately and firm than if it
9444,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,lived in obscurity. Each citizen feels that the national name which he
9445,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,bears is a pledge for his honour. The soldier's uniform much less
9446,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"surely checks the display of his vices, and an army's standard less"
9447,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,certainly excites its valour than the name of an illustrious country
9448,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,stimulates its sons to greatness and nobility. The _prestige_ of Rome's
9449,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,greatness operated even more on the souls of her citizens than on the
9450,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,hearts of her friends and foes.
9451,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,
9452,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"Again, it is peculiarly needful for _Ireland_ to have a Foreign Policy."
9453,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,Intimacy with the great powers will guard us from English interference.
9454,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"Many of the minor German states were too deficient in numbers,"
9455,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"boundaries, and wealth to have outstood the despotic ages of Europe but"
9456,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"for those foreign alliances, which, whether resting on friendship or a"
9457,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"desire to preserve the balance of power, secured them against their"
9458,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,rapacious neighbours. And now time has given its sanction to their
9459,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"continuance, and the progress of localisation guarantees their future"
9460,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"safety. When Ireland is a nation she will not, with her vast population"
9461,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"and her military character, require such alliances as a _security_"
9462,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,against an English _re-conquest_; but they will be useful in banishing
9463,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,any _dreams of invasion_ which might _otherwise_ haunt the brain of our
9464,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,old enemy.
9465,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,
9466,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,But England is a pedagogue as well as a gaoler to us. Her prison
9467,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"discipline requires the Helotism of mind. She shuts us up, like another"
9468,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"Caspar Hauser, in a dark dungeon, and tells us what she likes of"
9469,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,herself and of the rest of the world. And this renders foreign
9470,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,information most desirable for us.
9471,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,
9472,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"She calls France base, impious, poor, and rapacious. She lies. France"
9473,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,has been the centre of European mind for centuries. France was the
9474,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,first of the large states to sweep away the feudal despotism. France
9475,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,has a small debt and an immense army; while England has a vast debt and
9476,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"scanty forces. France has five millions of kindly, merry, well-fed"
9477,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,yeomen. England swarms with dark and withered artisans. Every seventh
9478,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"person you meet in France is a landowner in fee, subject to moderate"
9479,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,taxation. Taxes and tenancies-at-will have cleared out the yeomanry
9480,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,of England. France has a literature surpassing England's modern
9481,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,literature. France is an apostle of liberty--England the turnkey of the
9482,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"world. France is the old friend, England, the old foe, of Ireland. From"
9483,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,one we may judge all. England has defamed _all other countries_ in
9484,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,order to make us and her other slaves content in our fetters.
9485,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,
9486,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,England's eulogies on herself are as false and extravagant as her
9487,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,calumnies on all other states. She represents her constitution as the
9488,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"perfection of human wisdom; while in reality it is based on conquest,"
9489,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"shaken by revolution, and only qualified by disorder. Her boasted"
9490,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"tenures are the relics of a half-abolished serfdom, wherein the"
9491,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"cultivator was nothing, and the aristocrat everything, and in which a"
9492,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,primogeniture extending from the King to the Gentleman _often_ placed
9493,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"idiocy on the throne, and tyranny in the senate, and _always_ produced"
9494,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"disunion in families, monopoly in land, and peculation throughout every"
9495,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"branch of the public service. Her laws are complicated, and their"
9496,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,administration costly beyond any others ever known. Her motley and
9497,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"tyrannous flag she proclaims the first that floats, and her tottering"
9498,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,and cruel empire the needful and sufficient guardian of our liberties.
9499,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,
9500,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"By cultivating Foreign Relations, and growing intimate with foreign"
9501,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"states of society, we will hear a free and just criticism on England's"
9502,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,constitution and social state. We will have a still better and fairer
9503,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,commentary in the condition and civil structure of other countries.
9504,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,
9505,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"We will see _small_ free states--Norway, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland,"
9506,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"and Portugal--maintaining their homes free, and bearing their flags in"
9507,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,triumph for long ages. We will learn from themselves how they kept
9508,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,their freedom afloat amid the perils of centuries. We will salute them
9509,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"as brethren subject to common dangers, and interested in one"
9510,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,policy--localisation of power.
9511,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,
9512,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"The Catholic will see the Protestant states of Prussia, Holland,"
9513,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"Saxony, and America; and the Protestant will see the Catholic states"
9514,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"of Belgium, Bavaria, and France, all granting full liberty of"
9515,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,conscience--leaving every creed to settle its tenets with its
9516,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"conscience, and dealing, _as states_, only with citizens, not sects."
9517,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,
9518,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,He who fancies some intrinsic objection to our nationality to lie in
9519,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"the co-existence of two languages, three or four great sects, and a"
9520,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"dozen different races in Ireland, will learn that in Hungary,"
9521,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"Switzerland, Belgium, and America, different languages, creeds, and"
9522,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"races flourish kindly side by side, and he will seek in English"
9523,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,intrigues the real well of the bitter woes of Ireland.
9524,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,
9525,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"Germany, France, and America teach us that English economics are not"
9526,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"fit for a nation beginning to establish a trade, though they may be for"
9527,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,an old and plethoric trader; and therefore that English and Irish
9528,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,trading interests are directly opposed. Nor can our foreign trade but
9529,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,be served by foreign connections.
9530,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,
9531,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"The land tenures of France, Norway, and Prussia are the reverse of"
9532,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,England's. They resemble our own old tenures; they better suit our
9533,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,character and our wants than the loose holdings and servile wages
9534,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,system of modern England.
9535,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,
9536,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"These, and a host of lessons more, will we learn if we study the books,"
9537,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"laws, and manners, and cultivate an intimacy with the citizens of"
9538,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"foreign states. We will thus obtain countenance, sympathy, and help in"
9539,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"time of need, and honour and friendship in time of strength; and thus,"
9540,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"too, we will learn toleration towards each other's creed, distrust in"
9541,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"our common enemy, and confidence in liberty and nationality."
9542,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,
9543,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"Till Ireland has a foreign policy, and a knowledge of foreign states,"
9544,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,England will have an advantage over us in both military and moral ways.
9545,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,We will be without those aids on which even the largest nations have at
9546,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,times to depend; and we will be liable to the advances of England's
9547,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,treacherous and deceptive policy.
9548,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,
9549,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"Let us, then, return the ready grasp of America, and the warm sympathy"
9550,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"of France, and of every other country that offers us its hand and"
9551,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,heart. Let us cultivate a Foreign Policy and Foreign Information as
9552,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"useful helps in that national existence which is before us, though its"
9553,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"happiness and glory depend, in the first instance, on ""ourselves"
9554,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"alone."" Ireland has a glorious future, if she be worthy of it. We must"
9555,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"believe and act up to the lessons taught by reason and history, that"
9556,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,England is our interested and implacable enemy--a tyrant to her
9557,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"dependants--a calumniator of her neighbours, and both the despot and"
9558,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,defamer of Ireland for near seven centuries. Mutual respect for
9559,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"conscience, an avoidance of polemics, concession to each other,"
9560,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"defiance to the foe, and the extension of our foreign relations, are"
9561,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"our duty, and should be our endeavour. Vigour and policy within and"
9562,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,"without, great men to lead, educated men to organise, brave men to"
9563,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,follow--these are the means of liberation--these are elements of
9564,FOREIGN POLICY AND FOREIGN INFORMATION.,nationality.

9570,MORAL FORCE.,
9571,MORAL FORCE.,
9572,MORAL FORCE.,There are two ways of success for the Irish--arms and persuasion. They
9573,MORAL FORCE.,have chosen the latter. They have resolved to win their rights by moral
9574,MORAL FORCE.,"force. For this end they have confederated their names, their moneys,"
9575,MORAL FORCE.,"their thoughts, and their resolves. For this they meet, organise, and"
9576,MORAL FORCE.,"subscribe. For this they learn history, and forget quarrels; and for"
9577,MORAL FORCE.,"this they study their resources, and how to increase them."
9578,MORAL FORCE.,
9579,MORAL FORCE.,For moral success internal union is essential.
9580,MORAL FORCE.,
9581,MORAL FORCE.,"Ireland, through all its sects and classes, must demand Repeal before"
9582,MORAL FORCE.,"the English Minister will be left without a fair reason to resist it,"
9583,MORAL FORCE.,and not till then we be in a state to coerce his submission.
9584,MORAL FORCE.,
9585,MORAL FORCE.,"Conciliation of all sects, classes, and parties who oppose us, or who"
9586,MORAL FORCE.,"still hesitate, is _essential_ to moral force. For if, instead of"
9587,MORAL FORCE.,"leading a man to your opinions by substantial kindness, by zealous"
9588,MORAL FORCE.,"love, and by candid and wise teaching, you insult his tastes and his"
9589,MORAL FORCE.,"prejudices, and force him either to adopt your cause or to resist"
9590,MORAL FORCE.,"it--if, instead of slow persuasion, your weapons are bullying and"
9591,MORAL FORCE.,"intolerance, then your profession of moral force is a lie, and a lie"
9592,MORAL FORCE.,"which deceives no one, and your attacks will be promptly resisted by"
9593,MORAL FORCE.,every man of spirit.
9594,MORAL FORCE.,
9595,MORAL FORCE.,The Committee of the Repeal Association have of late begun to attend to
9596,MORAL FORCE.,the Registries. The majority of Irish electors belong to the middle
9597,MORAL FORCE.,class; and if all of that class who could register and vote did
9598,MORAL FORCE.,"register and vote, it would be out of the landlords' power to coerce"
9599,MORAL FORCE.,them. The landlords have awoken to a sense of their danger. They begin
9600,MORAL FORCE.,to know that if once the quiet patriots of this country conclude that
9601,MORAL FORCE.,"reform of the landlords is hopeless, the only barrier between them and"
9602,MORAL FORCE.,"their tenants will sink, and they will sink too."
9603,MORAL FORCE.,
9604,MORAL FORCE.,There will be less landlordism next election--at least we warn the
9605,MORAL FORCE.,landlords that there _must_ be less.
9606,MORAL FORCE.,
9607,MORAL FORCE.,"If, then, the majority of members chosen by the middle class oppose"
9608,MORAL FORCE.,"Domestic Legislation, the middle class is suspected of not being truly"
9609,MORAL FORCE.,national--the sincerity of the People is made doubtful--an impediment
9610,MORAL FORCE.,"is opposed to Repeal, which the Repeal Association properly strive to"
9611,MORAL FORCE.,upset.
9612,MORAL FORCE.,
9613,MORAL FORCE.,Therefore do they and we urge the Repealers to serve notices
9614,MORAL FORCE.,"diligently, accurately, and at once. Therefore do they and we prompt"
9615,MORAL FORCE.,"them to attend at the Sessions, and boldly claim their rights as"
9616,MORAL FORCE.,"citizens contributing to the State, and entitled to a vote in electing"
9617,MORAL FORCE.,its managers; and therefore do they and we advise each constituency to
9618,MORAL FORCE.,consider well whether they have or can procure a representative whose
9619,MORAL FORCE.,"purity of life, undoubted honesty, knowledge of politics, and devoted"
9620,MORAL FORCE.,zeal to secure Domestic Government fit him to legislate in St.
9621,MORAL FORCE.,"Stephen's, or to agitate in the Corn Exchange, or wherever else"
9622,MORAL FORCE.,nationality may have a temple.
9623,MORAL FORCE.,
9624,MORAL FORCE.,"We say, the advocacy of a ""Domestic Legislature,"" because _that_ is"
9625,MORAL FORCE.,"what Ireland wants. We are a province, drained by foreign taxation and"
9626,MORAL FORCE.,"absentees, governed by a foreign legislature and executive. We seek to"
9627,MORAL FORCE.,"have _Ireland_ governed by an Irish senate and executive for herself,"
9628,MORAL FORCE.,and by Irishmen; and although a man shall add to this a claim for a
9629,MORAL FORCE.,"share in the government of the _empire_, and of course a consent to"
9630,MORAL FORCE.,"give taxes and soldiers, therefore that (though to us it seems unwise)"
9631,MORAL FORCE.,is not such a difference as should make us divide. He is a Repealer of
9632,MORAL FORCE.,the Union as decidedly as if he never called himself a Federalist. Such
9633,MORAL FORCE.,"Repealing Federalists are Messrs. Crawford, Wyse, John O'Brien,"
9634,MORAL FORCE.,"Caulfield, Ross, O'Malley, O'Hagan, Bishop Kennedy, and numbers of"
9635,MORAL FORCE.,others in and out of the Association. In selecting or in agitating
9636,MORAL FORCE.,about Members we must therefore never forget that a Federalist is quite
9637,MORAL FORCE.,"as likely to be national as a technical Repealer, and that if his"
9638,MORAL FORCE.,morals and ability be better than those of a _so-called_ Repeal
9639,MORAL FORCE.,"candidate, he is the better man."
9640,MORAL FORCE.,
9641,MORAL FORCE.,"We have also classed morals, ability, and zeal as being quite as"
9642,MORAL FORCE.,requisite as national opinions in a Representative.
9643,MORAL FORCE.,
9644,MORAL FORCE.,"If our Members were a majority in the House, it might not be very"
9645,MORAL FORCE.,"moral, but at least it would have some show of excuse if we sent in a"
9646,MORAL FORCE.,"flock of pledged delegates to vote Repeal, regardless of their powers"
9647,MORAL FORCE.,or principles; though even then we might find it hard to get rid of the
9648,MORAL FORCE.,"scoundrels after Repeal was carried, and when Ireland would need"
9649,MORAL FORCE.,virtuous and unremitting wisdom to make her prosper.
9650,MORAL FORCE.,
9651,MORAL FORCE.,"But now, when our whole Members are not a sixth of the Commons, and"
9652,MORAL FORCE.,"when the English Whigs are as hostile to Repeal as the English Tories,"
9653,MORAL FORCE.,"and more hostile to it than the Irish Tories--now, it is plain we must"
9654,MORAL FORCE.,get weight for our opinions by the ability and virtue of our Members;
9655,MORAL FORCE.,"and therefore we exhort the People, as they love purity, as they prize"
9656,MORAL FORCE.,"religion, as they are true to themselves, to Ireland, and to liberty,"
9657,MORAL FORCE.,to spurn from their hustings any man who comes there without purity and
9658,MORAL FORCE.,"wisdom, though he took or kept a thousand Repeal pledges."
9659,MORAL FORCE.,
9660,MORAL FORCE.,"We want men who are not spendthrifts, drunkards, swindlers--we want"
9661,MORAL FORCE.,honest men--men whom we would trust with our private money or our
9662,MORAL FORCE.,family's honour; and sooner than see faded aristocrats and brawling
9663,MORAL FORCE.,profligates shelter themselves from their honest debtors by a Repeal
9664,MORAL FORCE.,"membership, we would leave Tories and Whigs undisturbed in their seats,"
9665,MORAL FORCE.,and strive to carry Repeal by other measures.
9666,MORAL FORCE.,
9667,MORAL FORCE.,"Conciliation, virtue, and wisdom are our moral means of success. They"
9668,MORAL FORCE.,must be used and sought on the hustings as well as in the Conciliation
9669,MORAL FORCE.,"Hall. We must not prematurely, and at Heaven knows what distance from"
9670,MORAL FORCE.,"an election, force a good and able man to accept a pledge or quarrel"
9671,MORAL FORCE.,"with us. Pledges are extreme things, hardly constitutional, and highly"
9672,MORAL FORCE.,"imprudent in a well-governed country. Nevertheless, they are sometimes"
9673,MORAL FORCE.,"needed, as are sharper remedies; and such need will exist here at the"
9674,MORAL FORCE.,general election. No man must go in for any place where the popular
9675,MORAL FORCE.,"will prevails unless he is a Repealer or a Federalist; and, what is"
9676,MORAL FORCE.,"_equally_ essential, an upright, unstained, and zealous man, who will"
9677,MORAL FORCE.,work for Ireland and do her credit. But it seems to us quite premature
9678,MORAL FORCE.,"to insist on those pledges from honourable, proud, and patriotic men"
9679,MORAL FORCE.,"_now_, who will, in all likelihood, be with us before an election"
9680,MORAL FORCE.,"comes, provided they are treated with the respect and forbearance due"
9681,MORAL FORCE.,to them whether they join us or not.
9682,MORAL FORCE.,
9683,MORAL FORCE.,"These are some of the canons of moral force; and if, as we trust,"
9684,MORAL FORCE.,"Ireland can succeed without cannon of another kind, it must be by using"
9685,MORAL FORCE.,those we have here mustered.

9693,CONCILIATION.,The People of Ireland have done well in naming the scene of their
9694,CONCILIATION.,future counsels the Conciliation Hall.
9695,CONCILIATION.,
9696,CONCILIATION.,"It intimates the cause of all our misery, and suggests the cure."
9697,CONCILIATION.,"Prostrated by division, union is our hope."
9698,CONCILIATION.,
9699,CONCILIATION.,"If Irishmen were united, the Repeal of the Union would be instantly and"
9700,CONCILIATION.,"quietly conceded. A Parliament, at whose election mutual generosity"
9701,CONCILIATION.,"would be in every heart and every act, would take the management of"
9702,CONCILIATION.,Ireland. For oh! we ask our direst foe to say from the bottom of his
9703,CONCILIATION.,"heart, would not the People of Ireland melt with joy and love to their"
9704,CONCILIATION.,Protestant brethren if they united and conquered? And surely from such
9705,CONCILIATION.,"a soil noble crops would grow. No southern plain heavy with corn, and"
9706,CONCILIATION.,"shining with fruit-clad hamlets, ever looked so warm and happy as would"
9707,CONCILIATION.,"the soul of Ireland, bursting out with all the generosity and beauty of"
9708,CONCILIATION.,a grateful People.
9709,CONCILIATION.,
9710,CONCILIATION.,We trust that the opening of the Conciliation Hall will be a signal to
9711,CONCILIATION.,Catholic and Protestant to _try_ and agree.
9712,CONCILIATION.,
9713,CONCILIATION.,Surely our Protestant brethren cannot shut their eyes to the honour it
9714,CONCILIATION.,"would confer on them and us if we gave up old brawls and bitterness,"
9715,CONCILIATION.,"and came together in love like Christians, in feeling like countrymen,"
9716,CONCILIATION.,"in policy like men having common interests. Can they--ah! tell us, dear"
9717,CONCILIATION.,countrymen!--can you harden your hearts at the thought of looking on
9718,CONCILIATION.,"Irishmen joined in commerce, agriculture, art, justice, government,"
9719,CONCILIATION.,"wealth, and glory?"
9720,CONCILIATION.,
9721,CONCILIATION.,"Fancy the aristocracy placed by just laws, or by wise concession, on"
9722,CONCILIATION.,"terms of friendship with their tenants, securing to these tenants every"
9723,CONCILIATION.,"farthing their industry entitled them to; living among them, promoting"
9724,CONCILIATION.,agriculture and education by example and instruction; sharing their
9725,CONCILIATION.,"joys, comforting their sorrows, and ready to stand at their head"
9726,CONCILIATION.,whenever their country called. Think well on it. Suppose it to exist in
9727,CONCILIATION.,"your own county, in your own barony and parish. Dwell on this sight."
9728,CONCILIATION.,"See the life of such a landlord and of such farmers--so busy, so"
9729,CONCILIATION.,"thoughtful, so happy! How the villages would ring with pleasure and"
9730,CONCILIATION.,"trade, and the fields laugh with contented and cheered labour. Imagine"
9731,CONCILIATION.,the poor supporting themselves on those waste lands which the home
9732,CONCILIATION.,"expenditure of our rents and taxes would reclaim, and the workhouse"
9733,CONCILIATION.,"turned into an hospital, or a district college. Education and art would"
9734,CONCILIATION.,"prosper; every village, like Italy, with its painter of repute. Then"
9735,CONCILIATION.,indeed the men of all creeds would be competent by education to judge
9736,CONCILIATION.,"of doctrines; yet, influenced by that education, to see that God meant"
9737,CONCILIATION.,"men to live, and love, and ennoble their souls; to be just, and to"
9738,CONCILIATION.,"worship Him, and not to consume themselves in rites, or theological"
9739,CONCILIATION.,"contention; or if they did discuss, they would do so not as enemies,"
9740,CONCILIATION.,but inquirers after truth. The clergy of different creeds would be
9741,CONCILIATION.,"placed on an equality, and would hope to propagate their faith not by"
9742,CONCILIATION.,"hard names or furious preaching, but by their dignity and wisdom, and"
9743,CONCILIATION.,by the marked goodness of their flocks. Men might meet or part at
9744,CONCILIATION.,church or chapel door without sneer or suspicion. From the christening
9745,CONCILIATION.,"of the child, till his neighbours, Catholic and Protestant, followed"
9746,CONCILIATION.,"his grey-haired corpse to the tomb, he might live enjoying much,"
9747,CONCILIATION.,"honoured much, and fearing nothing but his own carelessness or vice."
9748,CONCILIATION.,
9749,CONCILIATION.,"This, 'twill be said, is a paradise."
9750,CONCILIATION.,
9751,CONCILIATION.,"Alas! no--there would still be individual crime and misfortune,"
9752,CONCILIATION.,national difficulties and popular errors. These are in the happiest and
9753,CONCILIATION.,best countries.
9754,CONCILIATION.,
9755,CONCILIATION.,But the condition of many countries is as Paradise to what we are.
9756,CONCILIATION.,
9757,CONCILIATION.,"Where else in Europe is the peasant ragged, fed on roots, in a wigwam,"
9758,CONCILIATION.,without education?
9759,CONCILIATION.,
9760,CONCILIATION.,"Where else are the towns ruined, trade banished, the till, and the"
9761,CONCILIATION.,"workshop, and the stomach of the artisan empty? Where else is there an"
9762,CONCILIATION.,"exportation of over one-third of the rents, and an absenteeism of the"
9763,CONCILIATION.,chief landlords? What other country pays four and a half million taxes
9764,CONCILIATION.,"to a foreign treasury, and has its offices removed or filled with"
9765,CONCILIATION.,foreigners? Where else are the People told they are free and
9766,CONCILIATION.,"represented, yet only one in two hundred of them have the franchise?"
9767,CONCILIATION.,"Where, beside, do the majority support the Clergy of the minority? In"
9768,CONCILIATION.,what other country are the majority excluded from high ranks in the
9769,CONCILIATION.,"University? In what place, beside, do landlords and agents extort such"
9770,CONCILIATION.,vast rents from an indigent race? Where else are the tenants ever
9771,CONCILIATION.,"pulling, the owners ever driving, and both full of anger? And what"
9772,CONCILIATION.,"country so fruitful and populous, so strong, so well marked and guarded"
9773,CONCILIATION.,"by the sea, and with such an ancient name, was reduced to provincialism"
9774,CONCILIATION.,"by bribery and treacherous force, and is denied all national"
9775,CONCILIATION.,government?
9776,CONCILIATION.,
9777,CONCILIATION.,"And if the answer be, as it must, ""nowhere is the like seen,"" then we"
9778,CONCILIATION.,say that union amongst Irishmen would make this country comparatively a
9779,CONCILIATION.,paradise. For union would peacefully achieve independence; would enable
9780,CONCILIATION.,us to settle the landlord and tenant question; would produce religious
9781,CONCILIATION.,"equality, as the first act of independence; would restore the absentees"
9782,CONCILIATION.,"by the first of our taxes; would cherish our commerce, facilitate"
9783,CONCILIATION.,"agriculture and manufactures, and would introduce peace and social"
9784,CONCILIATION.,"exertion, instead of religious and political strife."
9785,CONCILIATION.,
9786,CONCILIATION.,"Again, then, we ask the Protestant to ponder over these things--to"
9787,CONCILIATION.,think of them when he lies down--to talk over them to his Catholic
9788,CONCILIATION.,neighbours--to see if he and they couldn't agree--and to offer up in
9789,CONCILIATION.,church his solemn prayers that this righteous and noble conclusion of
9790,CONCILIATION.,our mourning may be vouchsafed.
9791,CONCILIATION.,
9792,CONCILIATION.,"Where, in aught that has been said or done by the Catholic party, is"
9793,CONCILIATION.,there evidence of that intolerant and usurping spirit which the
9794,CONCILIATION.,Protestants seem to dread?
9795,CONCILIATION.,
9796,CONCILIATION.,"Do they think it possible for a whole People of some millions of men,"
9797,CONCILIATION.,"women, and children to tell a public lie, and to persevere in the giant"
9798,CONCILIATION.,falsehood for years? The present generation have been brought up in
9799,CONCILIATION.,"this faith of religious equality, and they would be liars, and"
9800,CONCILIATION.,"apostates too, if they wished for ascendency. We may add it would not"
9801,CONCILIATION.,"be safe nor possible for the Catholics to establish an ascendency,"
9802,CONCILIATION.,"even if the Union were repealed; and, therefore, we again ask the"
9803,CONCILIATION.,"Protestants, for the sake of peace, interest, and religion, to _try_ if"
9804,CONCILIATION.,they cannot unite with the Catholics for the prosperity of Ireland.
9805,CONCILIATION.,
9806,CONCILIATION.,To the Catholics we have nothing to say but to redouble their efforts.
9807,CONCILIATION.,
9808,CONCILIATION.,"Conciliation is a fixed and everlasting duty, independently of the"
9809,CONCILIATION.,political results it might have. If they despaired of winning the
9810,CONCILIATION.,"Protestants to Repeal, conciliation would still be their duty, as men"
9811,CONCILIATION.,"and Christians. But there is every ground for hope. The Protestants, in"
9812,CONCILIATION.,"defeating the rack-renters' anti-Repeal meeting, showed they began to"
9813,CONCILIATION.,"see their interest. Something has been, more shall be done to remove"
9814,CONCILIATION.,"the prejudice against the Catholics, derived from lying histories; and"
9815,CONCILIATION.,if we may take the stern reproof of the _Banner of Ulster_ to the
9816,CONCILIATION.,_Evening Mail_ as speaking the sentiments of the Presbyterians of the
9817,CONCILIATION.,"North, then they begin to feel like religious Irishmen, and they will"
9818,CONCILIATION.,presently be with us.

9826,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],Why on earth have so many of the People of Dublin made fools of
9827,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],themselves by getting together in Sackville Street every evening to
9828,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],"hoot at coaches? The coach contract was an injury and an insult to us,"
9829,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],"but it is now irremediable. We have serious work before us, and let us"
9830,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],"have no by-battles. To the devil with the whole affair, rather than"
9831,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],compromise our cause.
9832,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],
9833,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],"Nothing could please the Government more than frequent little rows,"
9834,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],which would get up a hatred between the soldiers and police and the

9836,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],"popular and patriotic, and the unarmed, we trust, more orderly,"
9837,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],"hospitable, and kindly every day. Let us have no more tussling and"
9838,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],patrolling.
9839,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],
9840,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],What do these mobs mean? A noisy mob is always rash--often cruel and
9841,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],"cowardly. A good friendly shout from a multitude is well, and a passing"
9842,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],"hearty curse endurable. The silent and stern assemblage of orderly men,"
9843,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],"like the myriads of Tipperary, or like one of Napoleon's armies, is a"
9844,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],"noble sight and a mighty power; but a scolding, hooting mob, which"
9845,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],"meets to make a noise, and runs away from a stick, a horse, or a sabre,"
9846,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],is a wretched affair.

9848,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],"""I hate little wars,"" said Wellington. So do we; and we hate still more"
9849,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],"a petty mob meeting without purpose, and dispersing without success."
9850,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],"Perfect order, silence, obedience, alacrity, and courage make an"

9852,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],"seriously injured by every scene or act of violence, no matter how"

9854,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],we have enough to _learn_ and to do without wasting our time in hissing
9855,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],and groaning coaches.

9857,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],"In reference to popular faults, we cannot help saying a word on the"
9858,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],"language applied to certain of the enemy's leaders, especially the Duke"
9859,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],of Wellington. We dislike the whole system of false disparagement. The
9860,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],Irish People will never be led to act the manly part which liberty
9861,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],"requires of them by being told that ""the Duke,"" that gallant soldier"
9862,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],"and most able general, is a screaming coward and doting corporal. We"
9863,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],have grave and solemn work to do. Making light of it or of our enemies
9864,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],"may inspire a moment's overweening confidence, but would ensure"

9874,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],by them. The contract runs out--Messrs. Bourne & Purcell propose in
9875,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],"form for it--an _informal_ proposal, at a rate inconsiderably"
9876,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],"lower, is sent in by another person, and is at once accepted. It is"
9877,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],"accepted notwithstanding its irregularity, and notwithstanding the"
9878,SCOLDING MOBS.[50],"offer of Messrs. Bourne & Purcell to take it, even at a loss, as"

9889,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,The people of Munster are in want--will murder feed them? Is there some
9890,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,prolific virtue in the blood of a landlord that the fields of the South
9891,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,will yield a richer crop where it has flowed? As the Jews dashed their
9892,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"door-posts on the Passover, shall the blood of an agent shelter the"
9893,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"cabins of Tipperary? Shame, shame, and horror! Oh! to think that these"

9895,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"Oh! bitter, bitter grief, that the loving breasts of Munster should"
9896,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"pillow heads wherein are black plots, and visions of butchery and"
9897,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"shadows of remorse! Oh! woe unutterable, if the men who abandoned the"

9899,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"the men who, last year, vowed patience, order, and virtue, rashly and"
9900,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,impiously revel in crime.
9901,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,
9902,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"But what do we say? Where are we led by our fears? Surely, Munster is"
9903,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,against these atrocities--they are the sins of a few--the People are
9904,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"pure and sound, and all will be well with Ireland! 'Tis so, 'tis so; we"
9905,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,pray God 'tis so: but yet the People are not without blame!
9906,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,
9907,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,Won't they come and talk to us about these horrid deeds? Won't they
9908,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,meet us (as brothers to consider disorders in their family) and do
9909,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,something--do all to stop them? Don't they confide in us? Oh! they
9910,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"know, well they know that our hearts love them better than life--well"
9911,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"they know that to-morrow, if 'twould serve, we would be ready to die by"
9912,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,their side in battle; but we are not ready to be their accomplices in
9913,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"crime--we would not be unsteady on the scaffold, so we honestly died"
9914,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"for them, but we have no share with the murderer!"
9915,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,
9916,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"Nor is it we alone, who have ever professed our willingness to take the"
9917,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"field with the people, who loathe and denounce these crimes. Let the"
9918,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"men of Munster read the last Act of the Repeal Association, and they"
9919,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"will find Daniel O'Connell, William Smith O'Brien, and the entire"
9920,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,Repeal League confederated to proclaim and trample down the assassins.
9921,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"Let them enter their chapels, and from every altar they will hear their"
9922,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,beloved priests solemnly warning them that the forms of the Church are
9923,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,as fiery coals on the heads of the blood-stained. Let them look upon
9924,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"government, and they will find a potent code and vast police--a"
9925,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"disciplined army--all just citizens, combined to quell the assassin;"
9926,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"and then let them with their consciences approach their God, and learn"
9927,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,that the murderer is dark before Him.
9928,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,
9929,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,Heaven and earth raise their voices against these crimes. Will they not
9930,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,be hopeless?--must they not be desperately wicked?
9931,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,
9932,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,What chance has the guilty of success?--what right to commit so deadly
9933,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"a sin? These murders will not give the people the land, nor leases, nor"
9934,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"low rents. When the country was in a rude state, intimidation easy, and"
9935,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"concealment easier, they tried the same thing. They began butchering"
9936,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,bailiffs--they rose to shooting landlords. Did they get nearer their
9937,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"object? Did they overpower their oppressors, stop the law, mitigate"
9938,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"their condition?--No, but the opposite; the successors of the"
9939,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,slaughtered men levied the rents and enforced the ejectments of the
9940,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"slain. They did so with greater zeal, for vengeance strengthened their"
9941,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"resolve. They did so with greater effect, for the law that might have"
9942,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"interfered where the people were oppressed, and society, which would"
9943,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"have aided the wronged people, took arms against assassins, and the"
9944,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,death groan of the victim was the best rallying cry of oppression.
9945,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,
9946,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"So it will be again. Already men whose tongues, and pens, and hearts"
9947,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,were busy pleading for better tenures and juster rents are silenced.
9948,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,They will not clamour for rights when assassins may recruit their gangs

9950,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,remedies for popular suffering are meditating means of popular
9951,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"coercion. The justice, not only of government but society, has grown"
9952,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"cautious of redress, and is preparing to punish--a repetition of guilt"
9953,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,will aggravate that punishment and postpone that redress.
9954,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,
9955,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"Headstrong and vain men, your sins will not give you a landlord the"

9957,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"rent there will be found men willing to hazard their lives to get it,"
9958,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"and you but arm them with fresh powers, with the sympathy of the public"
9959,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"and the increased force of law and government, to lean yet heavier on"

9961,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,
9962,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"Why, too, should Munster lead in guilt? Our richest province, our"
9963,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"purest race, our fairest scenes--oh! why should its bloodshed be as"

9965,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"of Kerry, the whole province of Connaught, many counties of Leinster"
9966,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,are under a harsher yoke than the men of North Munster: yet they do not
9967,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,seek relief in butchery.
9968,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,
9969,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"Thank God! they do not. How horrid a blot upon earth were Ireland, if"
9970,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,its poor had no reliance but the murder of the rich; better by far that
9971,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,that people rose and waged open war. That were wild--that were
9972,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,criminal; but 'twould be wisdom and mercy compared with these
9973,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,individual murders.
9974,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,
9975,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,How horrible is the condition of a district subject to such crimes! Few
9976,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"are struck, but all suffer! 'Tis as if men knew assuredly that a spirit"
9977,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"of plague were passing through the land, but knew not whom it would"
9978,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,wither. Think of a district where there has been peace--the People are
9979,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"poor, but they are innocent; some of the rich are merciless, but some"
9980,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"are just, and many are kind and sympathising; in their low homes, in"
9981,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"their safe chapels, in the faith of their fellows, in the hope of"
9982,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"better days, in the effort for improvement, but above all in their"
9983,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"conscious innocence, the most trampled of them have consolation, and"
9984,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,there is a sort of smile even on the wretched. But let some savage
9985,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,spirits appear among them--let the shebeen house supply the ferocity
9986,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"which religion kept down, and one oppressor is marked out for"
9987,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"vengeance, his path is spied, the bludgeon or the bullet smites, and he"
9988,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,is borne in to his innocent and loving family a broken and stained
9989,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"corpse, slain in his sins."
9990,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,
9991,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,Pursuit follows--the criminals become outlaws--they try to shelter
9992,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,their lives and console their consciences by making many share their
9993,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"guilt--another and another is struck at. Haunted by remorse, and"
9994,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"tracked by danger, and now intimate with crime, a less and a less"
9995,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"excuse suffices. He began by avenging his own wrong, becomes the"
9996,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"avenger of others, then perhaps the tool of others, who use the wrongs"
9997,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"of the country as a cloak for unjustified malice, and the _suspected_"
9998,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"tyrant or the rigid, yet not unjust, man shares the fate of the glaring"
9999,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,oppressors. What terror and suspicion--what a shadow as of death is
10000,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"there upon such a district! No one trusts his neighbour. The rich,"
10001,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"excited by such events, believe the poor have conspired to slay them."
10002,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"They dread their very domestics, they abhor the People, rage at the"
10003,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"country, summon each other, and all the aid that authority can give to"
10004,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"protect and to punish; they bar their doors before sunset, their"
10005,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,hearths are surrounded with guns and pistols--at the least rustle every
10006,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"heart beats and women shriek, and men with clenched teeth and"
10007,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,embittered hearts make ready for that lone and deadly conflict--that
10008,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"battle without object, without honour, without hope, without quarter."
10009,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,
10010,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,Then they cover the country with patrols--they raise up a cloud of
10011,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"hovering spies--no peasant, no farmer feels safe. Those who connive"
10012,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"shudder at every passing troop, and see an informer in every stranger."
10013,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,Those who do not connive tremble lest they be struck as enemies of the
10014,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,criminal; and thus from bad to worse till no home is safe--no heart
10015,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,calm of the thousands.
10016,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,
10017,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,As yet no district has attained this horrible ripeness; but to this
10018,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"North Munster may come, unless the People interfere and put down the"
10019,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,offenders.
10020,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,
10021,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,Will they suffer this hell-blight to come upon them? Will they wait
10022,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,till violence and suspicion are the only principles retaining power
10023,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"among them? Will they look on while the Repeal movement--the educating,"
10024,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"the ennobling, the sacred effort for liberty--is superseded by the buzz"
10025,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,of assassination and vengeance? Or will they now join O'Connell and
10026,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"O'Brien--the Association, the Law, and the Priesthood; and whenever"
10027,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"they hear a breath of outrage, denounce it as they would"
10028,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"Atheism--whenever they see an attempt at crime, interpose with brave,"
10029,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"strong hand, and, in Mr. O'Brien's words, ""leave the guilty no chance"
10030,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,of life but in hasty flight from the land they have stained with their
10031,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"crimes."""
10032,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,
10033,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"Once again we ask the People--the guiltless, the suffering, the noble,"
10034,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"the brave People of Munster--by their patience, by their courage, by"
10035,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,"their hopes for Ireland, by their love to God, we implore them to put"
10036,MUNSTER OUTRAGES.,down these assassins as they would and could were the weapons of the

10042,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.
10043,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,
10044,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,
10045,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,It was a bold experiment to establish _The Nation_. Our success is more
10046,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"honourable to Ireland than to us, for it was by defying evil customs"
10047,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,and bad prejudices we succeeded.
10048,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,
10049,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,Let us prove this.
10050,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,
10051,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,Religion has for ages been so mixed with Irish quarrels that it is
10052,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,often hard to say whether patriotism or superstition was the animating
10053,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"principle of an Irish leader, and whether political rapacity or bigoted"
10054,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,zeal against bigotry was the motive of an oppressor. Yet in no country
10055,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,was this more misplaced in our day than in Ireland. Our upper classes
10056,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"were mostly Episcopalians--masters not merely of the institutions, but"
10057,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,the education and moral force of the country. The middle ranks and much
10058,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"of the peasantry of one of our greatest provinces were Presbyterians,"
10059,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"obstinate in their simple creed--proud of their victories, yet"
10060,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"apprehensive of oppression. The rest of the population were Catholics,"
10061,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"remarkable for piety and tenderness, but equally noted for ignorance"
10062,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,and want of self-reliance. To mingle politics and religion in such a
10063,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"country was to blind men to their common secular interests, to render"
10064,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"political union impossible, and national independence hopeless."
10065,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,
10066,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,We grappled with the difficulty. We left sacred things to consecrated
10067,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,hands--theology and discipline to Churchmen. We preached a nationality
10068,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"that asked after no man's creed (_friend's or foe's_); and now, after"
10069,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"our Second Year's Work, we have got a _practical_ as well as a verbal"
10070,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,admission that religion is a thing between man and God--that no citizen
10071,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"is to be hooted, or abused, or marked down because he holds any"
10072,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"imaginable creed, or changes it any conceivable number of times."
10073,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,
10074,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"We are proudly conscious that, in preaching these great truths with"
10075,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"success, we have done more to convince the Protestants that they may"
10076,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,combine with the Catholics and get from under the shield of England
10077,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,than if we had proved that the Repeal of the Union would double the
10078,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,ears of their corn fields.
10079,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,
10080,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,There had been a long habit of looking to foreign arms or English mercy
10081,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,for redress. We have shared the labours of O'Connell and O'Brien in
10082,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,impressing on the People that self-reliance is the only liberator. We
10083,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"have, not in vain, taught that, though the concessions of England or"
10084,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"the sympathy of others was to be welcomed and used, still they would be"
10085,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"best won by dignity and strength; and that, whether they came or not,"
10086,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"Ireland could redress herself by patience, energy, and resolution."
10087,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,
10088,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"Yet, deficient as the People were in genuine self-reliance, they had"
10089,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"been pampered into the belief that they were highly educated, nobly"
10090,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"represented, successful in every science and art, and that consequently"
10091,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"their misery was a mysterious fate, for which there was no remedy in"
10092,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,human means. We believe we have convinced them of the contrary of this.
10093,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,Ireland has done great things. She has created an unrivalled music and
10094,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"oratory, taken a first place in lyric poetry, displayed great valour,"
10095,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,ready wit--has been a pattern of domestic virtue and faith under
10096,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,persecution; and lately has again advanced herself and her fame by
10097,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"deliberate temperance, by organised abstinence from crime, and by"
10098,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,increasing political discipline. Yet there is that worst of all facts
10099,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"on the face of the census, that most of the Irish can neither read nor"
10100,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"write; there is evidence in every exhibition that this land, which"
10101,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"produced Barry, Forde, Maclise, and Burton, is ignorant of the fine"
10102,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"arts; and proof in every shop or factory of the truth of Kane's motto,"
10103,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,that industrial ignorance is a prime obstacle to our wealth. We have no
10104,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"national theatre, either in books or performance; and though we have"
10105,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"got of late some classes of prose literature--national fiction, for"
10106,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"instance--we have yet to write our history, our statistics, and much of"
10107,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,our science.
10108,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,
10109,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"We have week after week candidly told these things to the People, and,"
10110,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"instead of quarrelling with us, or running off to men who said ""the"
10111,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"Irish have succeeded in everything,"" they hearkened to us, and raised"
10112,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,our paper into a circulation beyond most of the leaders of the London
10113,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"press, and immensely beyond any other journal that ever was in Ireland."
10114,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"What is more cheering still, they have set about curing their defects."
10115,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,They are founding Repeal Reading-rooms. They have noted down their
10116,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"ignorance in many portions of agriculture, manufactures, commerce,"
10117,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"history, literature, and fine arts; and they are working with the"
10118,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"Agricultural Societies, forming Polytechnic Institutions for the"
10119,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"improvement of manufactures, and giving and demanding support to the"
10120,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,antiquarian and historical and artistical books and institutions in
10121,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"Ireland. Large _classes_ wished well to, and small ones supported"
10122,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,each of these projects before; but in this journal _all_ classes
10123,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"were canvassed incessantly, and not in vain--and if there be unanimity"
10124,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"now, we claim some credit for ourselves, but much more for the People,"
10125,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"who did not resent harsh truth, and took advice that affronted their"
10126,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,vanity.
10127,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,
10128,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,A political impatience and intolerance have too often been seen in this
10129,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,country. It is one of the vices of slaves to use free speech to insult
10130,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,all who do not praise their faults and their friends and their
10131,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"caprices. We rejoice, in looking over our files, to see how rarely we"
10132,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,were personal and how generally we recognised the virtues of political
10133,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"foes. It is an equal pleasure to recall that in many questions, but"
10134,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"especially in reference to the Liberal Members not in the Association,"
10135,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,we stood between an impolitic fury and its destined victims. The People
10136,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"bore with us, and then agreed with us. We told them that men able and"
10137,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,virtuous--men who had gone into Parliament when Repeal was a Whig
10138,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"buggaboo to frighten the Tories, were not to be hallooed from their"
10139,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,seats because Repeal had suddenly grown into a national demand. These
10140,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"men, we said, may become your allies, if you do not put them upon their"
10141,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"mettle by your rudeness and impatience. If they join you, they will be"
10142,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,faster and more useful friends than men who compensate for every defect
10143,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,by pledge-bolting at command.
10144,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,
10145,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"Mr. O'Connell, who had at first seemed to incline to the opposite"
10146,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"opinion, concurred with us. Mr. O'Brien was zealous on the same side;"
10147,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"the ""premature pledges"" were postponed to their fit time--an"
10148,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"election--and the people induced to apply themselves to the Registries,"
10149,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,as the true means of getting Repeal members.
10150,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,
10151,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,We have maintained and advanced our foreign policy--the recognition and
10152,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"study of other countries beside England, and a careful separation of"
10153,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"ourselves from England's crimes. We have, we believe, not neglected"
10154,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"those literary, antiquarian, and historical teachings, and those"
10155,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,popular projects which we pointed to last year as part of our labours;
10156,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,and we are told that the poetry of _The Nation_ has not been worse than
10157,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"in our first year. But these things are more personal, less indicative"
10158,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"of national progress, and therefore less interesting than our success"
10159,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"in producing political tolerance, increased efforts for education, and"
10160,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,that final concession to religious liberty--the right to change without
10161,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,even verbal persecution.
10162,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,
10163,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,The last year has been a year of hard work and hard trial to the
10164,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,country and to us. Our first year was spent in rousing and
10165,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"animating--the second in maintaining, guiding, and restraining. Its"
10166,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"motto is, ""Bide your time."" Never had a People more temptation to be"
10167,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,rash; and it is our proudest feeling that in our way we aided the
10168,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"infinitely greater powers of O'Connell till his imprisonment, and of"
10169,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"O'Brien thereafter, to keep in the passion, while they kept up the"
10170,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,spirit of the People.
10171,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,
10172,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,They and we succeeded.
10173,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,
10174,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"The People saw the darling of their hearts dragged to trial, yet they"
10175,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,never rioted; they found month after month go by in the disgusting
10176,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"details of a trial at bar, yet, instead of desponding, they improved"
10177,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"their organisation, studied their history and statistics--increased in"
10178,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"dignity, modesty, and strength. At length came the imprisonment; we"
10179,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"almost doubted them, but they behaved gloriously--they recognised their"
10180,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"wrongs, but they crossed their arms--they were neither terrified,"
10181,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"disordered, nor divided--they promptly obeyed their new leaders, and,"
10182,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"with shut teeth, swore that their ""only vengeance should be victory."""
10183,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"They succeeded--bore their triumph as well as their defeat, and are now"
10184,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"taking breath for a fresh effort at education, organisation, and"
10185,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,conciliation.
10186,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,
10187,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,It is something to have laboured through a Second Year for such a
10188,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"People. Let them go on as they have begun--growing more thoughtful,"
10189,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"more temperate, more educated, more resolute--let them complete their"
10190,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"parish organisation, carry out their registries, and, above all,"
10191,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,establish those Reading-rooms which will inform and strengthen them
10192,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"into liberty; and, ere many years' work, the Green Flag will be saluted"
10193,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"by Europe, and Ireland will be a Nation. The People have shown that"
10194,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,"their spirit, their discipline, and their modesty can be relied on;"
10195,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,they have but to exhibit that greatest virtue which their enemies deny
10196,A SECOND YEAR'S WORK.,them--perseverence--and all will be well.

10318,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],
10319,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],
10320,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],The rough outlines of a plan of Academical Education for Ireland are
10321,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"now before the country. The plan, as appears from Sir James Graham's"
10322,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"very conciliatory speech, is to be found three Colleges; to give them"
10323,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"£100,000 for buildings, and £6,000 a year for expenses; to open them to"
10324,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],all creeds; the education to be purely secular; the students not to
10325,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"live within the Colleges; and the professors to be named and removed,"
10326,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"now and hereafter, by Government."
10327,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],
10328,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],The announcement of this plan was received in the Commons with
10329,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"extravagant praise by the Irish Whig and Repeal members, nor was any"
10330,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"hostility displayed except by the blockhead and bigot, Sir Robert"
10331,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"Inglis--a preposterous fanatic, who demands the repeal of the"
10332,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"Emancipation Act, and was never yet missed from the holy orgies of"
10333,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],Exeter Hall. Out of doors it has had a darker reception; but now that
10334,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"the first storm of joy and anger is over, it is time for the people of"
10335,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],Ireland to think of this measure.
10336,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],
10337,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],It is for them to consider it--it is for them to decide on it--it is
10338,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],for them to profit by it. For centuries the Irish were paupers and
10339,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"serfs, because they were ignorant and divided. The Protestant hated the"
10340,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"Catholic, and oppressed him--the Catholic hated the Protestant, and"
10341,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"would not trust him. England fed the bigotry of both, and flourished on"
10342,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],the ignorance of both. The ignorance was a barrier between our
10343,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"sects--left our merchant's till, our farmer's purse, and our state"
10344,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"treasury empty--stupefied our councils in peace, and slackened our arm"
10345,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],in war. Whatsoever plan will strengthen the soul of Ireland with
10346,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"knowledge, and knit the sects of Ireland in liberal and trusting"
10347,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"friendship, will be better for us than if corn and wine were scattered"
10348,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],from every cloud.
10349,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],
10350,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"While 400,000 of the poor find instruction in the National Schools, the"
10351,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],means of education for the middle and upper classes are as bad now as
10352,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],they were ten or fifty years ago. A farmer or a shopkeeper in Ireland
10353,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"cannot, by any sacrifice, win for his son such an education as would be"
10354,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],proffered to him in Germany. How can he afford to pay the expense of
10355,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"his son's living in the capital, in addition to Collegiate fees; and,"
10356,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"if he could, why should he send his son where, unless he be an"
10357,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"Episcopalian Protestant, those Collegiate offices which, though they"
10358,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"could be held but by a few score, would influence hundreds, are denied"
10359,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],him. Even to the gentry the distance and expense are oppressive; and to
10360,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],the Catholics and Presbyterians of them the monopoly is intolerable.
10361,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],
10362,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],To bring Academical Education within the reach and means of the middle
10363,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"classes, to free it from the disease of ascendency, and to make it a"
10364,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"means of union as well as of instruction, should be the objects of him"
10365,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],who legislates on this subject; and we implore the gentry and middle
10366,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"classes, whom it concerns, to examine this plan calmly and closely, and"
10367,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],to act on their convictions like firm and sensible men. If such a
10368,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"measure cannot be discussed in a reasonable and decent way, our"
10369,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],progress to self-government is a progress to giddy convulsions and
10370,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],shameful ruin.
10371,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],
10372,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],Let us look into the details of the plan.
10373,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],
10374,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"It grants £100,000 and £18,000 a year for the foundation of three"
10375,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],Provincial Colleges. The Colleges proposed are for the present numerous
10376,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],enough. It will be hard to get competent Professors for even these.
10377,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],Elementary Education has made great way; but the very ignorance for
10378,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],which these Institutions are meant as a remedy makes the class of
10379,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"Irishmen fit to fill Professors' chairs small indeed; and, small as it"
10380,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"is, it yearly loses its best men by emigration to London, where they"
10381,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"find rewards, fame, and excitement. The dismissal, hereafter, of"
10382,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"incompetent men would be a painful, but--if pedants, dunces, and cheats"
10383,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],were crammed into the chairs--an unavoidable task. A gradual increase
10384,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],of such Colleges will better suit the progress of Irish intelligence
10385,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"than a sudden and final endowment. But though the Colleges are enough,"
10386,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"and the annual allowance sufficient, the building fund is"
10387,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],inadequate--at least double the sum would be needed; but this brings us
10388,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],to another part of the plan--the residence of the students outside the
10389,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],College.
10390,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],
10391,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],To the extern residence we are decidedly opposed. It works well in
10392,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"Germany, where the whole grown population are educated; but in Ireland,"
10393,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"where the adult population are unhappily otherwise, 'tis a matter of"
10394,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"consequence to keep the students together, to foster an academic spirit"
10395,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"and character, and to preserve them from the stupefying influences of"
10396,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"common society. However, this point is but secondary, so we pass from"
10397,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"it, and come to the two great principles of the Bill."
10398,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],
10399,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],They are--Mixed Education and Government Nomination; and we are as
10400,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],resolute for the first as we are against the second.
10401,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],
10402,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],The objections to separate Education are immense; the reasons for it
10403,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"are reasons for separate life, for mutual animosity, for penal laws,"
10404,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],for religious wars. 'Tis said that communication between students of
10405,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],different creeds will taint their faith and endanger their souls. They
10406,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],who say so should prohibit the students from associating _out_ of the
10407,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],Colleges even more than _in_ them. In the Colleges they will be joined
10408,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"in studying mathematics, natural philosophy, engineering, chemistry,"
10409,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"the principles of reasoning, the constitution of man. Surely union in"
10410,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],these studies would less peril their faith than free communication out
10411,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"of doors. Come, come, let those who insist on unqualified separate"
10412,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],Education follow out their principles--let them prohibit Catholic and
10413,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"Protestant boys from playing, or talking, or walking together--let them"
10414,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],mark out every frank or indiscreet man for a similar prohibition--let
10415,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],them establish a theological police--let them rail off each sect (as
10416,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"the Jews used to be cooped) into a separate quarter; or rather, to save"
10417,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"preliminaries, let each of them proclaim war in the name of his creed"
10418,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"on the men of all other creeds, and fight till death, triumph, or"
10419,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],disgust shall leave him leisure to revise his principles.
10420,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],
10421,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],These are the logical consequences of the doctrine of Separate
10422,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"Education, but we acquit the friends of it of that or any other such"
10423,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],ferocious purpose. Their intentions are pious and sincere--their
10424,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"argument is dangerous, for they might find followers with less virtue"
10425,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],and more dogged consistency.
10426,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],
10427,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"We say ""an _unqualified_ separate Education,"" because it is said, with"
10428,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"some plausibility, that the manner in which theology mixes up with"
10429,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],history and moral philosophy renders common instruction in them almost
10430,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],impossible. The reasoning is pushed too far. Yet the objection should
10431,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],be well weighed; though we warn those who push it very far not to fall
10432,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"into the extravagance of a valued friend of ours, who protested against"
10433,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"one person attempting to teach medicine to Catholics and Protestants,"
10434,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"as one creed acknowledged miraculous cures and demoniacal possessions,"
10435,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],and the other rejected both!
10436,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],
10437,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"It should be noted, too, that this demand for separate _Professors_"
10438,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"does not involve separate Colleges, does not assume that any evil would"
10439,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"result from the friendship of the students, and does not lead to the"
10440,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"desperate, though unforeseen, conclusions which follow from the other"
10441,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],notion.
10442,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],
10443,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],'Tis also a different thing to propose the establishment of Deans in
10444,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],each College to inspect the religious discipline and moral conduct of
10445,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"the students--a Catholic Dean, appointed by the Catholic Church,"
10446,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],watching over the Catholic students; and so of the Episcopalians and
10447,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"Presbyterians. Such Deans, and Halls for religious teaching, will be"
10448,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"absolutely necessary, should a residence in the Colleges be required;"
10449,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],but should a system of residence in registered lodgings and
10450,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"boarding-houses be preferred, similar duties to the Deans might be"
10451,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"performed by persons nominated by the Catholic, Protestant, and"
10452,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"Presbyterian Churches respectively, without the direct interposition of"
10453,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],the College; for each parent would take care to put his child under the
10454,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],control of his own Church. An adequate provision in some sufficient
10455,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"manner for religious discipline is essential, and to be dispensed with"
10456,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],on no pretence.
10457,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],
10458,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"These, however, are details of great consequence to be discussed in the"
10459,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"Commons' Committee; but we repeat our claim for mixed education,"
10460,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"because it has worked well among the students of Trinity College, and"
10461,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"would work better were its offices free, because it is the principle"
10462,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"approved by Ireland when she demanded the opening of those offices, and"
10463,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],when she accepted the National Schools--because it is the principle of
10464,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"the Cork, the Limerick, and the Derry meetings; but above all, because"
10465,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"it is consistent with piety, and favourable to that union of Irishmen"
10466,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"of different sects, for want of which Ireland is in rags and chains."
10467,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],
10468,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],Against the nomination of Professors by Government we protest
10469,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],altogether. We speak alike of Whig or Tory. The nomination would be
10470,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"_looked on_ as a political bribe, the removal as a political"
10471,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"punishment. Nay, the nomination _would_ be political. Under great"
10472,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"public excitement a just nomination might be made, but in quiet times"
10473,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],it would be given to the best mathematician or naturalist who attended
10474,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],the levee and wrote against the opposition. And it would be an enormous
10475,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"power; for it would not merely control the immediate candidates, but"
10476,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"hundreds, who thought they might some ten years after be solicitors for"
10477,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"professorships, would shrink from committing themselves to uncourtly"
10478,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"politics, or qualify by Ministerial partisanship, not philosophical"
10479,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"study, for that distant day. A better engine for corrupting that great"
10480,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],literary class which is the best hope of Ireland could not be devised;
10481,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"and if it be retained in the Bill, that Bill must be resisted and"
10482,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"defeated, whether in or out of Parliament. We warn the Minister!"
10483,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],
10484,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],We have omitted a strange objection to the Bill--that it does not give
10485,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],mixed education. It is said the Colleges of Cork and Galway would be
10486,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"attended only by Catholics, and that of Belfast by Protestants. Both"
10487,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],are errors. The middle class of Protestants in Cork is numerous--they
10488,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],and the poorer gentry would send their sons to the Cork College to save
10489,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],expense. The Catholics would assuredly do the same in Belfast; they do
10490,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],so with the Institution in the Academy there already; and though the
10491,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"Catholics in Cork, and the Protestants in Belfast, would be the"
10492,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"majorities, enough of the opposite creed would be in each to produce"
10493,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"all the wholesome restraint, and much of the wholesome toleration and"
10494,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"goodwill, of the mixed system of Trinity. Were the objection good,"
10495,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"however, it ought to content the advocates of separate education."
10496,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],
10497,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"It has been said, too, that the Bill recognises a religious ascendency"
10498,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],in the case of Belfast. This seems to us a total misconception of the
10499,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],words of the Minister. He suggested that the Southern College should be
10500,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"in Cork, the Western in Limerick or Galway, the Northern in Derry or"
10501,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],Belfast. Had he stopped at Derry the mistake could never have occurred;
10502,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"but he went on to say that if the College were planted in Belfast, the"
10503,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],building now used for the Belfast Academy would serve for the new
10504,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"College, and unless the echoes of the old theological professors be"
10505,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"more permanent than common, we cannot understand the sectarianism of"
10506,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],the _building_ in Belfast.
10507,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],
10508,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],A more valid objection would be that the measure was not more complete;
10509,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],and the University system will certainly be crippled and impotent
10510,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],unless residence for a year at least in it be essential to a University
10511,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],degree.
10512,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],
10513,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],The main defect of the Bill is its omitting to deal with Trinity
10514,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],College. It is said that the property is and was Protestant; but the
10515,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"Bill of '93, which admitted Catholics to be educated on this Protestant"
10516,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"foundation, broke down the title; and, at all events, the property is"
10517,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"as public as the Corporation, and is liable to all the demands of"
10518,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],public convenience. But it is added that the property of Trinity
10519,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"College is not more than £30,000 or £40,000 a year, and that the grant"
10520,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"for Catholic Clerical Education alone is £26,000 a year; and certainly"
10521,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],till the Protestant Church be equalised to the wants of the Protestant
10522,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],population there will be something in the argument. When that
10523,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"Reformation comes, a third of the funds should be given for Protestant"
10524,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"Clerical Education, and the College livings transferred to the Clerical"
10525,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"College, and the remaining two-thirds preserved to Trinity College as a"
10526,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],secular University.
10527,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],
10528,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"Waiting that settlement, we see nothing better than the proposal so"
10529,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"admirably urged by the _Morning Chronicle_, of the grant of £6,000--we"
10530,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"say £10,000--a year, for the foundation of Catholic fellowships and"
10531,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"scholarships in Trinity College. Some such change must be made, for it"
10532,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"would be the grossest injustice to give Catholics a share, or the"
10533,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"whole, of one or two new, untried, characterless Provincial Academies,"
10534,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"and exclude them from the offices of the ancient, celebrated, and"
10535,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"national University. If there is to be a religious equality, Trinity"
10536,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"College must be opened, or augmented by Catholic endowment. For this no"
10537,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"demand can be too loud and vehement, for the refusal will be an affront"
10538,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],and a grievance to the Catholics of Ireland.
10539,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],
10540,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],We have only run over the merits and faults of this plan. Next to a
10541,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"Tenure or a Militia Bill, it is the most important possible. Questions"
10542,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"must arise on every section of it; and, however these questions be"
10543,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"decided, we trust in God they will be decided without acrimony or"
10544,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],"recrimination, and that so divine a subject as Education will not lead"
10545,ACADEMICAL EDUCATION.[51],to disunions which would prostrate our country.
