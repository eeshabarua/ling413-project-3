409,SIR RIBOLT.,"The Count he rode to Kulloe house,"
410,SIR RIBOLT.,Where the kemps were drinking a deep carouse.
411,SIR RIBOLT.,
412,SIR RIBOLT.,He enter'd at Sir Truid's gate--
413,SIR RIBOLT.,At his table wide Sir Truid sate.
414,SIR RIBOLT.,
415,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Here, Truid, thou sitt'st the red wine taking,"
416,SIR RIBOLT.,"Whilst Ribolt off with thy bride is making."""
417,SIR RIBOLT.,
418,SIR RIBOLT.,Then through his hall Sir Truid roar'd:
419,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Up, up, ye knights, take helm and sward!"""
420,SIR RIBOLT.,
421,SIR RIBOLT.,Barely a mile had they advanced
422,SIR RIBOLT.,When fair Gulborg behind her glanced.
423,SIR RIBOLT.,
424,SIR RIBOLT.,"""O yonder my father's steed I see,"
425,SIR RIBOLT.,"And the knight who is betrothed to me."""
426,SIR RIBOLT.,
427,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Gulborg, be therefore in no pain,"
428,SIR RIBOLT.,But hold our steeds by the bridle rein.
429,SIR RIBOLT.,
430,SIR RIBOLT.,"""And though to earth thou see me fall,"
431,SIR RIBOLT.,Gulborg thou must not upon me call.
432,SIR RIBOLT.,
433,SIR RIBOLT.,"""And though thou see me freely bleed,"
434,SIR RIBOLT.,"Let not my name from thy mouth proceed."""
435,SIR RIBOLT.,
436,SIR RIBOLT.,"His helm on his head Sir Ribolt cast,"
437,SIR RIBOLT.,Gulborg with her fair hands laced it fast.
438,SIR RIBOLT.,
439,SIR RIBOLT.,"Then, crying his cry, he slays outright"
440,SIR RIBOLT.,"Her father dear and her plighted knight,"
441,SIR RIBOLT.,
442,SIR RIBOLT.,"And, at the second ""Halloo,"" he slew"
443,SIR RIBOLT.,Her brothers with locks of yellow hue.
444,SIR RIBOLT.,
445,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Desist, O Ribolt, my heart's ador'd,"
446,SIR RIBOLT.,"'Tis time, 'tis time to sheath thy sword."
447,SIR RIBOLT.,
448,SIR RIBOLT.,"""My youngest brother I pray thee spare,"
449,SIR RIBOLT.,That he to my mother may tiding bear;
450,SIR RIBOLT.,
451,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Bear her the tidings of the slaughter,"
452,SIR RIBOLT.,"O would she never had borne a daughter!"""
453,SIR RIBOLT.,
454,SIR RIBOLT.,"Scarce had the name of Ribolt sounded,"
455,SIR RIBOLT.,"When Ribolt tottered, deadly wounded."
456,SIR RIBOLT.,
457,SIR RIBOLT.,"He sheathed his faulchion, blood be-dyed:"
458,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Come, dear Gulborg, we hence will ride."""
459,SIR RIBOLT.,
460,SIR RIBOLT.,"They thread the mazes of the wood,"
461,SIR RIBOLT.,"No word escaped him, bad or good."
462,SIR RIBOLT.,
463,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Hear, Ribolt, hear, my destined mate,"
464,SIR RIBOLT.,"Why art not glad as thou wast of late?"""
465,SIR RIBOLT.,
466,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Gulborg, I feel my life-blood leak,"
467,SIR RIBOLT.,"Gulborg, I feel me faint and weak."
468,SIR RIBOLT.,
469,SIR RIBOLT.,"""But chiefly, chiefly I look not pleas'd"
470,SIR RIBOLT.,"Because Death's hand my heart has seiz'd."""
471,SIR RIBOLT.,
472,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Myself of my girdle I'll dis-array,"
473,SIR RIBOLT.,"And thy streaming blood will stanch and stay."""
474,SIR RIBOLT.,
475,SIR RIBOLT.,"""God bless thee ever, my own true love,"
476,SIR RIBOLT.,"Of service slight will thy girdle prove."""
477,SIR RIBOLT.,
478,SIR RIBOLT.,"And when to the Castle gate they won,"
479,SIR RIBOLT.,His mother stood there and leaned thereon.
480,SIR RIBOLT.,
481,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Welcome, my son, thou art welcome twice,"
482,SIR RIBOLT.,And thy fair young bride she is welcome thrice.
483,SIR RIBOLT.,
484,SIR RIBOLT.,"""I ne'er have seen a bride so pale"
485,SIR RIBOLT.,"Come travelling over hill and dale."""
486,SIR RIBOLT.,
487,SIR RIBOLT.,"""If pale she be is a wonder slight,"
488,SIR RIBOLT.,When she has witness'd so hard a fight.
489,SIR RIBOLT.,
490,SIR RIBOLT.,"""God grant I may retain my breath"
491,SIR RIBOLT.,Whilst parting presents I bequeath.
492,SIR RIBOLT.,
493,SIR RIBOLT.,"""To my father I give my courser tall,"
494,SIR RIBOLT.,O mother I pray thee a priest to call.
495,SIR RIBOLT.,
496,SIR RIBOLT.,"""And unto my brother, who's standing near,"
497,SIR RIBOLT.,"I give Gulborg whom I love so dear."""
498,SIR RIBOLT.,
499,SIR RIBOLT.,"""O willingly her to wife I'd take,"
500,SIR RIBOLT.,"If, brother, 'twere not for the black sin's sake."""
501,SIR RIBOLT.,
502,SIR RIBOLT.,"""May the Lord God me in my trouble aid,"
503,SIR RIBOLT.,So sure as she is for me a maid.
504,SIR RIBOLT.,
505,SIR RIBOLT.,"""'Twas only once that I had the bliss"
506,SIR RIBOLT.,"From her rosy mouth to snatch a kiss."""
507,SIR RIBOLT.,
508,SIR RIBOLT.,"""O better, better to sink in death,"
509,SIR RIBOLT.,"Than unto two brothers plight my faith."""
510,SIR RIBOLT.,
511,SIR RIBOLT.,"Ribolt was dead ere the cock did cry,"
512,SIR RIBOLT.,Gulborg was dead ere the sun was high.
513,SIR RIBOLT.,
514,SIR RIBOLT.,"They bore from the Castle corses three,"
515,SIR RIBOLT.,A handsome corse was each to see.
516,SIR RIBOLT.,
517,SIR RIBOLT.,"The one was Ribolt, the other his bride,"
518,SIR RIBOLT.,"His mother the third, of grief she died."
