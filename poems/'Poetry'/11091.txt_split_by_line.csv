32,PROEM,At times on his pathetic face
33,PROEM,"A look of perfect rapture shone,"
34,PROEM,"Intent on some celestial chords,"
35,PROEM,Discerned by him alone;
36,PROEM,"And sometimes he would smile and pause,"
37,PROEM,As if receiving loud applause.

39,PROEM,"So, many a humble poet dreams"
40,PROEM,"His songs will touch the human heart,"
41,PROEM,And full of hope his offering lays
42,PROEM,Before the shrine of Art;
43,PROEM,"Poor dreamer, may he never know"
44,PROEM,That he too draws a silent bow!

220,"MY ""PROMENADE SOLITAIRE""","I stroll, and ask what can compare"

222,"MY ""PROMENADE SOLITAIRE""",
223,"MY ""PROMENADE SOLITAIRE""",To and fro 'neath the nascent green

227,"MY ""PROMENADE SOLITAIRE""","I saunter, halting here and there"
228,"MY ""PROMENADE SOLITAIRE""",For the view from my Promenade Solitaire.
229,"MY ""PROMENADE SOLITAIRE""",
230,"MY ""PROMENADE SOLITAIRE""","In and out through the silence sweet,"
231,"MY ""PROMENADE SOLITAIRE""",Plash of fountain and song of bird

237,"MY ""PROMENADE SOLITAIRE""","Onward rushes the world without,"
238,"MY ""PROMENADE SOLITAIRE""",But the breeze which over my garden steals

256,"MY ""PROMENADE SOLITAIRE""",As I gaze from my Promenade Solitaire.
257,"MY ""PROMENADE SOLITAIRE""",
258,"MY ""PROMENADE SOLITAIRE""","It is ever the same old tale of greed,"

290,REINCARNATION,
291,REINCARNATION,"I know not how, I know not where,"
292,REINCARNATION,But from my own heart's mystic lore
293,REINCARNATION,"I feel that I have breathed this air,"
294,REINCARNATION,And walked this earth before;
295,REINCARNATION,
296,REINCARNATION,"And that in this, its latest form"
297,REINCARNATION,"My old-time spirit once more strives,"
298,REINCARNATION,As it has fought through many a storm
299,REINCARNATION,"In past, forgotten lives."
300,REINCARNATION,
301,REINCARNATION,Not inexperienced did my soul
302,REINCARNATION,This incarnation's threshold tread;
303,REINCARNATION,Not recordless has proved the scroll
304,REINCARNATION,It brought back from the dead.
305,REINCARNATION,
306,REINCARNATION,"To certain, special lines of thought"
307,REINCARNATION,"My mind intuitively tends,"
308,REINCARNATION,And old affinities have brought
309,REINCARNATION,"Not new, but ancient friends."
310,REINCARNATION,
311,REINCARNATION,What thrilled me in a previous state
312,REINCARNATION,Rekindles here its ancient flame;
313,REINCARNATION,What I by instinct love and hate
314,REINCARNATION,I knew before I came;
315,REINCARNATION,
316,REINCARNATION,"And lands, of which in youth I dreamed"
317,REINCARNATION,"And read, heart-moved, and longed to see,"
318,REINCARNATION,"When really visited, have seemed"
319,REINCARNATION,Not strange but known to me.
320,REINCARNATION,
321,REINCARNATION,"When Mozart, still a child, untaught,"
322,REINCARNATION,"Ran joyous to the silent keys,"
323,REINCARNATION,And with inspired fingers wrought
324,REINCARNATION,"Majestic harmonies,"
325,REINCARNATION,
326,REINCARNATION,There fell upon his psychic ear
327,REINCARNATION,Faint echoes of a music known
328,REINCARNATION,"Before his natal advent here,"
329,REINCARNATION,In former lives outgrown.
330,REINCARNATION,
331,REINCARNATION,In many a dumb brute's wistful eyes
332,REINCARNATION,"A dawning human soul aspires,"
333,REINCARNATION,"For thus from lower forms we rise,--"
334,REINCARNATION,Ourselves our spirits' sires.
335,REINCARNATION,
336,REINCARNATION,Full many a thought that thrills my breast
337,REINCARNATION,Is fruit resulting from a seed
338,REINCARNATION,"Sown elsewhere,--on my soul impressed"
339,REINCARNATION,By many an arduous deed;
340,REINCARNATION,
341,REINCARNATION,Full many a fetter which hath lamed
342,REINCARNATION,My struggling spirit's upward flight
343,REINCARNATION,"Was once by that same spirit framed,"
344,REINCARNATION,When further from the Light;
345,REINCARNATION,
346,REINCARNATION,"With justice, therefore, comes the pain"
347,REINCARNATION,That o'er the tortured world extends;
348,REINCARNATION,"And hopeful is the lessening stain,"
349,REINCARNATION,As each life-cycle ends.
350,REINCARNATION,
351,REINCARNATION,"No changeless, endless states await"
352,REINCARNATION,The good and evil souls set free;
353,REINCARNATION,Each grave is a successive gate
354,REINCARNATION,In immortality.
355,REINCARNATION,
356,REINCARNATION,Too long this mighty truth hath slept
357,REINCARNATION,"Among the darkened souls of men,--"
358,REINCARNATION,"""Ye cannot see God's face, except"
359,REINCARNATION,"Ye shall be born again."""
360,REINCARNATION,
361,REINCARNATION,"The God-like Christs and Buddhas yearn,"
362,REINCARNATION,"However high their spirits' stage,"
363,REINCARNATION,"For man's salvation to return,"
364,REINCARNATION,As Saviour or as Sage.
365,REINCARNATION,
366,REINCARNATION,"On our benighted, groping minds"
367,REINCARNATION,"Their noble precepts, star-like, shine;"
368,REINCARNATION,"Each soul, that wisely seeks them, finds"
369,REINCARNATION,The truths that are divine.
370,REINCARNATION,
371,REINCARNATION,"Misunderstood and vilified,"
372,REINCARNATION,"Their aims and motives scarcely known,"
373,REINCARNATION,"How many of these Saints have died,"
374,REINCARNATION,Rejected by their own!
375,REINCARNATION,
376,REINCARNATION,"Yet, though their followers miss the way,"
377,REINCARNATION,"In spite of precept and of prayer,"
378,REINCARNATION,"And lead unnumbered souls astray,"
379,REINCARNATION,"Committed to their care,"
380,REINCARNATION,
381,REINCARNATION,"Upon the lofty spirit-plane,"
382,REINCARNATION,"Where all lies open to their sight,"
383,REINCARNATION,The Masters know that not in vain
384,REINCARNATION,They left the Hills of Light.

451,THE WAIF,"Two dainty hands prepare the draught,"
452,THE WAIF,While loving glances meet my own;
453,THE WAIF,"Two lips repeat (the coffee quaffed),"
454,THE WAIF,"""To-night 'tis sweet to be alone."""
455,THE WAIF,
456,THE WAIF,Hark! in the court my faithful hound
457,THE WAIF,Breaks rudely on our tête-à-tête;
458,THE WAIF,Too well I understand that sound!
459,THE WAIF,A mendicant is at my gate.
460,THE WAIF,
461,THE WAIF,Admit him? Yes; for none shall say
462,THE WAIF,That he who seeks in want my door
463,THE WAIF,Is ever harshly turned away;
464,THE WAIF,"His plea is heard, if nothing more."
465,THE WAIF,
466,THE WAIF,"I leave my comforts with a sigh,"
467,THE WAIF,"And, passing to the outer hall,"
468,THE WAIF,"Behold a wanderer doomed to die,--"
469,THE WAIF,"So ill, I look to see him fall."
470,THE WAIF,
471,THE WAIF,I know his story ere he speaks;
472,THE WAIF,"And listening to his labored breath,"
473,THE WAIF,"I trace, with tears upon my cheeks,"
474,THE WAIF,His long and hopeless fight with death.
475,THE WAIF,
476,THE WAIF,"A poor, storm-beaten, lonely waif,"
477,THE WAIF,Lured southward from a colder clime
478,THE WAIF,By hope and that unfailing faith
479,THE WAIF,That health will come again in time!
480,THE WAIF,
481,THE WAIF,Alas! too late; the dread disease
482,THE WAIF,Hath fixed its roots too firmly there;
483,THE WAIF,"And now sick, friendless, at my knees,"
484,THE WAIF,He pours forth his heart-breaking prayer.
485,THE WAIF,
486,THE WAIF,"What are his needs? Before all, food!"
487,THE WAIF,"Hot soup, bread, wine, until at last"
488,THE WAIF,A sense of human brotherhood
489,THE WAIF,Obliterates his cruel past;
490,THE WAIF,
491,THE WAIF,"Yet not for long; for though well-fed,"
492,THE WAIF,"With warmer garments than before,"
493,THE WAIF,"He hath no place to lay his head,"
494,THE WAIF,On turning from my friendly door.
495,THE WAIF,
496,THE WAIF,"I slip some silver in his hand,"
497,THE WAIF,"('Twill purchase shelter for the night,)"
498,THE WAIF,"Then, silent and remorseful, stand"
499,THE WAIF,To watch his bent form out of sight.
500,THE WAIF,
501,THE WAIF,"On, on he goes through snow and sleet,"
502,THE WAIF,With nothing more of warmth and cheer!
503,THE WAIF,From such a home to such a street!
504,THE WAIF,"Ah, should I not have kept him here?"
505,THE WAIF,
506,THE WAIF,"My room is no less bright and warm,"
507,THE WAIF,But all its charm and joy have fled;
508,THE WAIF,That lonely figure in the storm
509,THE WAIF,Leaves both our hearts uncomforted.
510,THE WAIF,
511,THE WAIF,For this is but one tiny wave
512,THE WAIF,"In life's vast, shoreless sea of woe,--"
513,THE WAIF,"One note in man's hoarse cry to save,"
514,THE WAIF,Resounding o'er its ebb and flow;
515,THE WAIF,
516,THE WAIF,"I ask myself in blank dismay,--"
517,THE WAIF,Ought I my little wealth to own?
518,THE WAIF,"Yet, should I give it all away,"
519,THE WAIF,'Twere but a drop to ocean thrown!
520,THE WAIF,
521,THE WAIF,"Great God! if what I dimly see,"
522,THE WAIF,"In this small section of mankind,"
523,THE WAIF,"Of pain and want and misery,"
524,THE WAIF,"Can thus bring anguish to my mind,"
525,THE WAIF,
526,THE WAIF,"How canst _Thou_ view the awful _whole_,"
527,THE WAIF,As our ensanguined planet rolls
528,THE WAIF,From unknown source to unknown goal
529,THE WAIF,Its freight of suffering human souls?
530,THE WAIF,
531,THE WAIF,Permitted pain!--the first and last
532,THE WAIF,"Of riddles that we strive to solve,"
533,THE WAIF,"More poignant ever, and more vast,"
534,THE WAIF,"As man's mentalities evolve,"
535,THE WAIF,
536,THE WAIF,"I hear thy victims' ceaseless wails,"
537,THE WAIF,"I view the path my race hath trod,"
538,THE WAIF,"And at the sight my spirit quails,"
539,THE WAIF,And cries in agony to God!

545,THE SILVER HERONS,
546,THE SILVER HERONS,Within a home for captive beasts
547,THE SILVER HERONS,"Whose world had dwindled to a cage,"
548,THE SILVER HERONS,I noted in their mournful eyes
549,THE SILVER HERONS,"Such resignation, fear, and rage,"
550,THE SILVER HERONS,"I longed at once to set them free,"
551,THE SILVER HERONS,And send them over land and sea
552,THE SILVER HERONS,To live again in liberty.
553,THE SILVER HERONS,
554,THE SILVER HERONS,"For them no more the mountain range,"
555,THE SILVER HERONS,"The desert vast, the jungle's lair!"
556,THE SILVER HERONS,Their meaner fate through grated bars
557,THE SILVER HERONS,To feel the public's hateful stare;
558,THE SILVER HERONS,Poor prisoners! doomed henceforth to pace
559,THE SILVER HERONS,"With stinted strides a narrow space,"
560,THE SILVER HERONS,"And, daily, gaping crowds to face."
561,THE SILVER HERONS,
562,THE SILVER HERONS,"At length I stood before a cage,"
563,THE SILVER HERONS,"Where, guarded by a loftier screen,"
564,THE SILVER HERONS,"Were artificial rocks, and pools,"
565,THE SILVER HERONS,And strips of vegetation green;
566,THE SILVER HERONS,"There, perched upon some rocky mound,"
567,THE SILVER HERONS,"Or crouching on the miry ground,"
568,THE SILVER HERONS,A flock of waterfowl I found.
569,THE SILVER HERONS,
570,THE SILVER HERONS,"Storks, poised upon a single leg,"
571,THE SILVER HERONS,"Stood dreaming of the eternal Nile,--"
572,THE SILVER HERONS,"The Mecca of their winter flight,"
573,THE SILVER HERONS,When lured by Egypt's sunny smile;
574,THE SILVER HERONS,"While ducks and geese, in gabbling mood,"
575,THE SILVER HERONS,"Explored the muddy pond for food,"
576,THE SILVER HERONS,Attended by their noisy brood.
577,THE SILVER HERONS,
578,THE SILVER HERONS,Their keeper brought their evening meal;
579,THE SILVER HERONS,"And instantly on broad-webbed feet,"
580,THE SILVER HERONS,"And stilt-like legs, and flapping wings,"
581,THE SILVER HERONS,"The feathered bipeds rushed to greet,"
582,THE SILVER HERONS,"With snaps and cluckings of delight,"
583,THE SILVER HERONS,"The joyful, ever-welcome sight"
584,THE SILVER HERONS,Of supper at the approach of night.
585,THE SILVER HERONS,
586,THE SILVER HERONS,"Yet all came not! Two stood apart,"
587,THE SILVER HERONS,"With plumage like fresh-fallen snow,--"
588,THE SILVER HERONS,"Two ""Silver Herons,"" of a race"
589,THE SILVER HERONS,As pure and fine as earth can show;
590,THE SILVER HERONS,"Amid the tumult that was rife,"
591,THE SILVER HERONS,"These loathed the others' greedy strife,"
592,THE SILVER HERONS,And looked disgusted with their life.
593,THE SILVER HERONS,
594,THE SILVER HERONS,"With closed eyes, shrinking from the mass,"
595,THE SILVER HERONS,"They seemed, in thought, removed as far"
596,THE SILVER HERONS,From all their coarse environment
597,THE SILVER HERONS,As sun is separate from star!
598,THE SILVER HERONS,"The very picture of disdain,"
599,THE SILVER HERONS,"From all such gorging, it was plain,"
600,THE SILVER HERONS,They had determined to refrain.
601,THE SILVER HERONS,
602,THE SILVER HERONS,"The keeper murmured with reproach,--"
603,THE SILVER HERONS,"""Those Silver Herons are too proud!"
604,THE SILVER HERONS,Why should they not partake of food
605,THE SILVER HERONS,Together with the common crowd?
606,THE SILVER HERONS,"They eat a little from my hand,"
607,THE SILVER HERONS,"But would prefer to starve, than stand"
608,THE SILVER HERONS,Besmeared by that uncleanly band.
609,THE SILVER HERONS,
610,THE SILVER HERONS,"""A month hence, neither will be here;"
611,THE SILVER HERONS,For both will grieve themselves to death;
612,THE SILVER HERONS,"And when one falls, its mate expires"
613,THE SILVER HERONS,With scarcely an additional breath;
614,THE SILVER HERONS,"And, should there come another pair,"
615,THE SILVER HERONS,In their turn they the fate will share
616,THE SILVER HERONS,"Of those two herons standing there."""
617,THE SILVER HERONS,
618,THE SILVER HERONS,"Poor hapless birds! I see them yet,"
619,THE SILVER HERONS,"Alone and starving in their pride,--"
620,THE SILVER HERONS,"Their glittering plumage still intact,"
621,THE SILVER HERONS,While standing bravely side by side;
622,THE SILVER HERONS,"And, although put to hunger's test,"
623,THE SILVER HERONS,Continuing mutely to protest
624,THE SILVER HERONS,Against defilement with the rest.
625,THE SILVER HERONS,
626,THE SILVER HERONS,"O Silver Herons, teach mankind"
627,THE SILVER HERONS,To cherish thus a stainless name!
628,THE SILVER HERONS,"To shun the vile, ignoble crowd,"
629,THE SILVER HERONS,Preferring death to smirch and shame!
630,THE SILVER HERONS,"A foul, unfriendly mob to brave,"
631,THE SILVER HERONS,"And go, unspotted, to the grave,"
632,THE SILVER HERONS,"Is not to _lose_ one's life, but _save_."

658,TO THE SPHINX,Thy solemn lips are dumb;

1666,THE DEATH OF ANTONINUS PIUS,
1667,THE DEATH OF ANTONINUS PIUS,"Now the sunset glow is fading,"
1668,THE DEATH OF ANTONINUS PIUS,And the evening shadows creep
1669,THE DEATH OF ANTONINUS PIUS,"O'er the ashen face of Caesar,"
1670,THE DEATH OF ANTONINUS PIUS,As he lies in seeming sleep;
1671,THE DEATH OF ANTONINUS PIUS,"But he slumbers not; for, faithful"
1672,THE DEATH OF ANTONINUS PIUS,"To his duties, small and great,"
1673,THE DEATH OF ANTONINUS PIUS,"He is not alone the sovereign,"

1675,THE DEATH OF ANTONINUS PIUS,
1676,THE DEATH OF ANTONINUS PIUS,"Unrebuked, then, his Centurion,"

1678,THE DEATH OF ANTONINUS PIUS,Makes his wonted way to Caesar
1679,THE DEATH OF ANTONINUS PIUS,For the password of the night;
1680,THE DEATH OF ANTONINUS PIUS,"And great Antonine, though conscious"
1681,THE DEATH OF ANTONINUS PIUS,"That ere dawn his soul must pass,"

1698,THE BUTTERFLY,
1699,THE BUTTERFLY,"I watched to-day a butterfly,"
1700,THE BUTTERFLY,"With gorgeous wings of golden sheen,"
1701,THE BUTTERFLY,Flit lightly 'neath a sapphire sky
1702,THE BUTTERFLY,Amid the springtime's tender green;--
1703,THE BUTTERFLY,
1704,THE BUTTERFLY,"A creature so divinely fair,"
1705,THE BUTTERFLY,"So frail, so wraithlike to the sight,"
1706,THE BUTTERFLY,"I feared to see it melt in air,"
1707,THE BUTTERFLY,As clouds dissolve in morning light.
1708,THE BUTTERFLY,
1709,THE BUTTERFLY,"With sudden swoop, a brutal boy"
1710,THE BUTTERFLY,"Caught in his cap its fans of gold,"
1711,THE BUTTERFLY,And forced them down with savage joy
1712,THE BUTTERFLY,Upon the path's defiling mould;
1713,THE BUTTERFLY,
1714,THE BUTTERFLY,"Then cautiously, the ground well scanned,"
1715,THE BUTTERFLY,"He clutched his darkened, helpless prey,"
1716,THE BUTTERFLY,"And, pinched within his grimy hand,"
1717,THE BUTTERFLY,Withdrew it to the light of day.
1718,THE BUTTERFLY,
1719,THE BUTTERFLY,"Alas! its fragile bloom was gone,"
1720,THE BUTTERFLY,"Its gracile frame was sorely hurt,"
1721,THE BUTTERFLY,"Its silken pinions drooped forlorn,"
1722,THE BUTTERFLY,Disfigured by the dust and dirt;
1723,THE BUTTERFLY,
1724,THE BUTTERFLY,"Its life, a moment since so gay,"
1725,THE BUTTERFLY,"So joyous in its dainty flight,"
1726,THE BUTTERFLY,"Was slowly ebbing now away,--"
1727,THE BUTTERFLY,Its too-brief day eclipsed by night.
1728,THE BUTTERFLY,
1729,THE BUTTERFLY,"Meantime, the vandal, face aflame,"
1730,THE BUTTERFLY,"Surveyed it dying in his grasp,"
1731,THE BUTTERFLY,Yet knew no grief nor sense of shame
1732,THE BUTTERFLY,In watching for its final gasp.
1733,THE BUTTERFLY,
1734,THE BUTTERFLY,"At last its sails of gold and brown,"
1735,THE BUTTERFLY,"Of texture fine and colors rare,"
1736,THE BUTTERFLY,"Came, death-struck, slowly fluttering down,"
1737,THE BUTTERFLY,No more to cleave the sunlit air;
1738,THE BUTTERFLY,
1739,THE BUTTERFLY,"One happy, harmless being less,"
1740,THE BUTTERFLY,To bid us dream the world is sweet!
1741,THE BUTTERFLY,"Gone like a gleam of happiness,"
1742,THE BUTTERFLY,A glimpse of rapture ... incomplete!
1743,THE BUTTERFLY,
1744,THE BUTTERFLY,Yet who shall say this creature fair
1745,THE BUTTERFLY,In God's sight had a smaller worth
1746,THE BUTTERFLY,"Than that dull lout who watched it there,"
1747,THE BUTTERFLY,And in its death found cause for mirth?
1748,THE BUTTERFLY,
1749,THE BUTTERFLY,"For what, in truth, are we who claim"
1750,THE BUTTERFLY,"An endless life beyond the grave,"
1751,THE BUTTERFLY,"But insects of a larger frame,"
1752,THE BUTTERFLY,Whose souls may be too small to save?
1753,THE BUTTERFLY,
1754,THE BUTTERFLY,"Since far-off times, when Cave Men fought"
1755,THE BUTTERFLY,"Like famished brutes for bloody food,"
1756,THE BUTTERFLY,And through unnumbered centuries sought
1757,THE BUTTERFLY,"To rear their naked, whelp-like brood,"
1758,THE BUTTERFLY,
1759,THE BUTTERFLY,"How many million men have died,"
1760,THE BUTTERFLY,"From pole to pole through every clime,--"
1761,THE BUTTERFLY,"An awful, never-ending tide"
1762,THE BUTTERFLY,Swept deathward on the shores of Time!
1763,THE BUTTERFLY,
1764,THE BUTTERFLY,"Like insects swarming in the sun,"
1765,THE BUTTERFLY,"They flutter, struggle, mate, and die,"
1766,THE BUTTERFLY,"And, with their life-work scarce begun,"
1767,THE BUTTERFLY,Are struck down like the butterfly;
1768,THE BUTTERFLY,
1769,THE BUTTERFLY,"A million more, a million less,"
1770,THE BUTTERFLY,"What matters it? The Earth rolls on,"
1771,THE BUTTERFLY,"Unmindful of mankind's distress,"
1772,THE BUTTERFLY,"Or if the race be here, or gone."
1773,THE BUTTERFLY,
1774,THE BUTTERFLY,"Thus rolled our globe ere man appeared,"
1775,THE BUTTERFLY,"And thus will roll, with wrinkled crust,"
1776,THE BUTTERFLY,"Deserted, lifeless, old, and seared,"
1777,THE BUTTERFLY,When man shall have returned to dust.
1778,THE BUTTERFLY,
1779,THE BUTTERFLY,And IT at last shall also die!
1780,THE BUTTERFLY,"Hence, measured by the eternal scale,"
1781,THE BUTTERFLY,"It ranks but as the butterfly,--"
1782,THE BUTTERFLY,"A world, ephemeral, fair and frail."
1783,THE BUTTERFLY,
1784,THE BUTTERFLY,"Man, insect, earth, or distant star,--"
1785,THE BUTTERFLY,They differ only in degree;
1786,THE BUTTERFLY,"Their transient lives, or near or far,"
1787,THE BUTTERFLY,Are moments in eternity!
1788,THE BUTTERFLY,
1789,THE BUTTERFLY,Yet somehow to my spirit clings
1790,THE BUTTERFLY,"The faith that man survives the sod,"
1791,THE BUTTERFLY,For this poor insect's broken wings
1792,THE BUTTERFLY,Have raised my thoughts from earth to God.

1802,AFTER THE STORM,Have ceased their fearful play;
1803,AFTER THE STORM,The pent up fury of their hate
1804,AFTER THE STORM,"Hath found at last release,"

1815,AFTER THE STORM,Appears the sunset glow.
1816,AFTER THE STORM,
1817,AFTER THE STORM,"An hour since, a torrid heat"
1818,AFTER THE STORM,Oppressed the languid frame;

1820,AFTER THE STORM,The solar touch seemed flame;
1821,AFTER THE STORM,"But now the air rejuvenates,"
1822,AFTER THE STORM,"The breeze refreshment brings,"
1823,AFTER THE STORM,"The lustrous leaves drop diamonds,"
1824,AFTER THE STORM,The lark with rapture sings.
1825,AFTER THE STORM,
1826,AFTER THE STORM,"Fear not, dear heart! life's darkest storms"
1827,AFTER THE STORM,Shall likewise end in light;

1829,AFTER THE STORM,The sun shines clear and bright;
1830,AFTER THE STORM,Once more celestial heights shall wear
1831,AFTER THE STORM,"Their sheen of spotless snow,"

1833,AFTER THE STORM,The smile of God shall glow.

1841,FALLEN,As champion of the world's opprest;

1843,FALLEN,Whose flag all struggling freemen cheered;
1844,FALLEN,In clutching at an empire's crest
1845,FALLEN,Thou too art fallen like the rest.
1846,FALLEN,
1847,FALLEN,"Not in thy numbers, wealth or might,"
1848,FALLEN,Proud mistress of a continent!
1849,FALLEN,"For rival nations, at the sight"
1850,FALLEN,"Of thy resources, view with fright"
1851,FALLEN,Thy progress without precedent;
1852,FALLEN,Not there is seen thy swift descent.
1853,FALLEN,
1854,FALLEN,Reread the story of thy birth!
1855,FALLEN,Recall the years in conflict spent
1856,FALLEN,To prove to a despairing earth
1857,FALLEN,That every Government of worth
1858,FALLEN,Is really based on free consent;
1859,FALLEN,Then view with shame thy present bent!
1860,FALLEN,

1863,FALLEN,The victims of despotic crime
1864,FALLEN,"In thee, the latest born of Time,"
1865,FALLEN,"Beheld a land from tyrants free,"
1866,FALLEN,The sacred Ark of Liberty.
1867,FALLEN,
1868,FALLEN,But now the Old World's lust for lands
1869,FALLEN,Infects thee too; the dread disease
1870,FALLEN,Hath left its plague-spots on thy hands;
1871,FALLEN,Thy monster area still expands;
1872,FALLEN,"For, blind to history's Nemesis,"
1873,FALLEN,Thou too wouldst alien races seize.
1874,FALLEN,
1875,FALLEN,Condemning with profound disdain
1876,FALLEN,"All other nations' heartless greed,"
1877,FALLEN,How couldst thou buy from humbled Spain
1878,FALLEN,A people struggling to attain
1879,FALLEN,A freedom suited to their need?
1880,FALLEN,Why stultify thy boasted creed?
1881,FALLEN,
1882,FALLEN,"Thine aid to them thou mightst have given,"
1883,FALLEN,As France her aid once gave to thee;
1884,FALLEN,"With them thy sons might well have striven,"
1885,FALLEN,And their blood-rusted fetters riven;
1886,FALLEN,"But why, in Heaven's name, should we"
1887,FALLEN,Shoot men aspiring to be free?
1888,FALLEN,
1889,FALLEN,"I tread the fields where thousands sleep,--"
1890,FALLEN,The blood-soaked fields that freed the slave;
1891,FALLEN,What precious memories still they keep
1892,FALLEN,For hearts that mourn and eyes that weep!
1893,FALLEN,Yet for the lives those heroes gave
1894,FALLEN,What have we that they died to save?
1895,FALLEN,
1896,FALLEN,A Union? Yes; outstretched in might
1897,FALLEN,"From snow to palm, from sea to sea;"
1898,FALLEN,"But pledged to use its strength aright,"
1899,FALLEN,And evermore to keep alight
1900,FALLEN,The torch of human liberty:
1901,FALLEN,Is this the Union that we see?
1902,FALLEN,
1903,FALLEN,Where history's Martyr dared to break
1904,FALLEN,"The power that held a race in chains,"
1905,FALLEN,"I see the ghastly lynching-stake,"
1906,FALLEN,"Where brutal mobs their vengeance take,"
1907,FALLEN,"And, since no law their course restrains,"
1908,FALLEN,Gloat o'er their writhing victim's pains.
1909,FALLEN,
1910,FALLEN,"Race hatred,--born of groundless fears"
1911,FALLEN,"And narrow prejudice of caste--,"
1912,FALLEN,Now greets the cultured black with sneers
1913,FALLEN,"And, barring him from high careers,"
1914,FALLEN,"Breaks, like a mad iconoclast,"
1915,FALLEN,The nation's idols of the past.
1916,FALLEN,
1917,FALLEN,No more can we with steadfast eyes
1918,FALLEN,"Protest, when tortured races moan"
1919,FALLEN,With hands uplifted toward the skies;
1920,FALLEN,Their tyrants answer with surprise
1921,FALLEN,"And new-born insolence of tone,--"
1922,FALLEN,"""These are our lynchings; cure your own!"""
1923,FALLEN,
1924,FALLEN,Yet hope remains! A path retraced
1925,FALLEN,Is nobler than persistent wrong;
1926,FALLEN,A fault confessed is half effaced;
1927,FALLEN,That land alone can be disgraced
1928,FALLEN,"Which is not just, however strong,"
1929,FALLEN,"Toward those to whom its ""spoils"" belong."
1930,FALLEN,
1931,FALLEN,My country! Would to God that praise
1932,FALLEN,"Might leave my lips, instead of blame!"
1933,FALLEN,"So near the parting of the ways,"
1934,FALLEN,Subjected to the eager gaze
1935,FALLEN,"Of millions, jealous of thy fame,"
1936,FALLEN,Retrace the path that ends in shame!

2824,"ORIENT TO OCCIDENT, 1906",
2825,"ORIENT TO OCCIDENT, 1906",We needed rude awakening to rouse us from our sloth;

2827,"ORIENT TO OCCIDENT, 1906","Unbarred their ports to modern fleets, their ancient life forswore,"
2828,"ORIENT TO OCCIDENT, 1906",And learned from greedy foreigners the Christians' art of war.

2835,"ORIENT TO OCCIDENT, 1906","Yet think not we deceive ourselves; you praise, but really dread"

2870,"ORIENT TO OCCIDENT, 1906","You talk by electricity, you ride on wings of steam,"

2872,"ORIENT TO OCCIDENT, 1906","The grandest triumphs of the race, forgetting that mere speed"
2873,"ORIENT TO OCCIDENT, 1906",In transference of men and things is less than one great deed.

2875,"ORIENT TO OCCIDENT, 1906","You treat us condescendingly, as if our gifts were small,"

2877,"ORIENT TO OCCIDENT, 1906",Earth's greatest continent is ours; her highest mountains rise

2880,"ORIENT TO OCCIDENT, 1906",Unequalled numbers of mankind adore him as divine.
2881,"ORIENT TO OCCIDENT, 1906","How dare you speak of Asian thought with pity or a sneer,"
2882,"ORIENT TO OCCIDENT, 1906",When practically all you know originated here?
2883,"ORIENT TO OCCIDENT, 1906","What had you been, if our ideals, in art and faith expressed,"
2884,"ORIENT TO OCCIDENT, 1906",Had not come down through Greece and Rome to civilize your West?
2885,"ORIENT TO OCCIDENT, 1906","The great religions of the world are all of Asian birth,"
2886,"ORIENT TO OCCIDENT, 1906",And thence went forth resistlessly to dominate the earth.
2887,"ORIENT TO OCCIDENT, 1906","Of six we granted one to you; and you profess its creeds,"
2888,"ORIENT TO OCCIDENT, 1906",But what a sorry travesty you make of it in deeds!
2889,"ORIENT TO OCCIDENT, 1906",The Christ taught love to enemies; His followers to-day
2890,"ORIENT TO OCCIDENT, 1906",Have trained the whole male Christian world their fellow men to slay!
2891,"ORIENT TO OCCIDENT, 1906",The very Bible that you prize was writ by Asian hands;

2898,"ORIENT TO OCCIDENT, 1906","The ""Star of Empire,"" as you claim, has ""westward"" made its way;"

2915,"ORIENT TO OCCIDENT, 1906",Still much as I instructed you in Syria and Cathay.
2916,"ORIENT TO OCCIDENT, 1906","Keep you, then, the material, I hold the mental, realm;"

2923,THE CAPTIVE,
2924,THE CAPTIVE,I opened the cage of my pet canary;
2925,THE CAPTIVE,"Timid, it faltered a moment there,"
2926,THE CAPTIVE,"Then, at my call, became less wary,"
2927,THE CAPTIVE,And blithely sprang to the buoyant air.
2928,THE CAPTIVE,
2929,THE CAPTIVE,Brief was its dream of freedom's rapture;
2930,THE CAPTIVE,A window barred its sunward flight;

2933,THE CAPTIVE,
2934,THE CAPTIVE,"Out in the park two birds were mating,"
2935,THE CAPTIVE,Building together their tiny nest;
2936,THE CAPTIVE,"Keenly the captive watched them, waiting,"
2937,THE CAPTIVE,Pressing the glass with its throbbing breast.
2938,THE CAPTIVE,
2939,THE CAPTIVE,"Leaving at length the window-casing,"
2940,THE CAPTIVE,"Lighting by chance on a neighboring shelf,"
2941,THE CAPTIVE,"It stood before a mirror, facing"
2942,THE CAPTIVE,The pretty form of its own sweet self.
2943,THE CAPTIVE,
2944,THE CAPTIVE,"Falling in love with its own reflection,"
2945,THE CAPTIVE,"Thinking it always another bird,"
2946,THE CAPTIVE,"Bravely it tried to win affection,"
2947,THE CAPTIVE,Warbling tones I had never heard.
2948,THE CAPTIVE,
2949,THE CAPTIVE,"Hopeless alas! its tender wooing,"
2950,THE CAPTIVE,"Vainly it trilled its sweetest note,"
2951,THE CAPTIVE,"Coldly received was its ardent sueing,"
2952,THE CAPTIVE,Silent the mirrored songster's throat.
2953,THE CAPTIVE,
2954,THE CAPTIVE,"Wearied at last, it flew off sadly,"
2955,THE CAPTIVE,"Back to the cage's open door,"
2956,THE CAPTIVE,Back to the home it left so gladly
2957,THE CAPTIVE,Only a little hour before.
2958,THE CAPTIVE,
2959,THE CAPTIVE,Dead are the lovers so fondly mated!
2960,THE CAPTIVE,Gone is their nest; it was blown away!

3615,MY BORES,
3616,MY BORES,I take their hands with placid smile
3617,MY BORES,"And words which social rules enforce,"
3618,MY BORES,Though sadly conscious all the while
3619,MY BORES,"Of something very like remorse,"
3620,MY BORES,Because beneath the mask I wear
3621,MY BORES,I really wish they were not there.
3622,MY BORES,
3623,MY BORES,Their visits I at heart resent;
3624,MY BORES,The half-read volume haunts my thought;
3625,MY BORES,The urgent note remains unsent;
3626,MY BORES,"The verse, unfinished, comes to naught;"
3627,MY BORES,"And all because, on some pretence,"
3628,MY BORES,They waste their time at my expense.
3629,MY BORES,
3630,MY BORES,"Yet no grim misanthrope am I,"
3631,MY BORES,"Who fears, distrusts, and hates his race;"
3632,MY BORES,"I merely wish them to pass by,"
3633,MY BORES,And seek some other lounging-place;
3634,MY BORES,"For, frankly, I should love them more"
3635,MY BORES,A little further from my door.
3636,MY BORES,
3637,MY BORES,In vain I make no answering calls;
3638,MY BORES,They blandly smile and come again!
3639,MY BORES,"Nay, even bring within my walls"
3640,MY BORES,"More curious strangers in their train,"
3641,MY BORES,"""Who wished so much your home to see!"""
3642,MY BORES,Why do they never think of me?
3643,MY BORES,

3646,MY BORES,"How dare they give themselves the right,"

3652,MY BORES,"Their mania for some silly game,"
3653,MY BORES,"Their hours in stupid gossip spent,--"
3654,MY BORES,Would give me self-contempt and shame;
3655,MY BORES,Between us is no common ground
3656,MY BORES,On which a comradeship to found.
3657,MY BORES,
3658,MY BORES,A word or two upon the street
3659,MY BORES,Suffice me with the most of men;
3660,MY BORES,"Beyond a greeting, when we meet."
3661,MY BORES,I care not if we speak again;
3662,MY BORES,My books and Nature's charming face
3663,MY BORES,Such human consorts well replace.
3664,MY BORES,
3665,MY BORES,"Not all, indeed; for who but yearns"
3666,MY BORES,To call some kindred heart his own?
3667,MY BORES,"Some friend to whom he fondly turns,"
3668,MY BORES,"And with whom he is still alone,"
3669,MY BORES,"Since each, while absolutely free,"
3670,MY BORES,Respects the other's privacy.
3671,MY BORES,
3672,MY BORES,To such his pent-up love o'erflows;
3673,MY BORES,With such his soul's seclusion ends;
3674,MY BORES,"For each the other's nature knows,"
3675,MY BORES,And every motive comprehends;
3676,MY BORES,"So perfectly do both agree,"
3677,MY BORES,So close their bond of sympathy!
3678,MY BORES,
3679,MY BORES,But those who come to wear away
3680,MY BORES,"With me the time they deem a bore,"
3681,MY BORES,And blithely rob me of a day
3682,MY BORES,Which God Himself cannot restore--
3683,MY BORES,"From such, at risk of being rude,"
3684,MY BORES,I will preserve my solitude.
3685,MY BORES,
3686,MY BORES,Their vapid visits I refuse;
3687,MY BORES,Their forced attachment I decline;
3688,MY BORES,I surely have the right to choose
3689,MY BORES,"The friends, whose lives shall blend with mine;"
3690,MY BORES,My bark shall gain the open sea
3691,MY BORES,With but the few I love and me.

4168,STAR DRIFT,"Again the welcome night is mine,"
4169,STAR DRIFT,Wherein to view the worlds on high;
4170,STAR DRIFT,"The night! when heaven bares its face,"
4171,STAR DRIFT,And man with reverent soul can trace
4172,STAR DRIFT,The awful mysteries of space.
4173,STAR DRIFT,
4174,STAR DRIFT,Too long the shadeless solar blaze
4175,STAR DRIFT,Hath forced my vision toward the sod;
4176,STAR DRIFT,'Tis night alone that helps us raise
4177,STAR DRIFT,"Our thoughts from littleness to God,"
4178,STAR DRIFT,And by its darkness sets us free
4179,STAR DRIFT,To gaze across what seems to be
4180,STAR DRIFT,The portal of Eternity.
4181,STAR DRIFT,
4182,STAR DRIFT,I watch the stellar hosts ascend
4183,STAR DRIFT,"Their devious paths in slow array,"
4184,STAR DRIFT,And note the place where millions blend
4185,STAR DRIFT,"To form the fabled Milky Way,---"
4186,STAR DRIFT,"That zone of radiant suns, whose light"
4187,STAR DRIFT,Hath needed centuries of flight
4188,STAR DRIFT,"To reach our little earth to-night,"
4189,STAR DRIFT,
4190,STAR DRIFT,"Through lenses scanned, its golden haze"
4191,STAR DRIFT,Resolves itself to points that glow
4192,STAR DRIFT,"In one stupendous, brilliant maze"
4193,STAR DRIFT,"Of countless orbs, that come and go"
4194,STAR DRIFT,"On pathways we may never learn,"
4195,STAR DRIFT,"However long their light may burn,"
4196,STAR DRIFT,However ardently we yearn.
4197,STAR DRIFT,
4198,STAR DRIFT,"Apparently so densely strewn,"
4199,STAR DRIFT,But oh! what gulfs those suns divide!
4200,STAR DRIFT,As each pursues its course alone
4201,STAR DRIFT,Beyond an interval as wide
4202,STAR DRIFT,As that which yawns between our own
4203,STAR DRIFT,And any of those star-seeds sown
4204,STAR DRIFT,"In astral gardens, still unknown."
4205,STAR DRIFT,
4206,STAR DRIFT,Sometimes from that resplendent sheen
4207,STAR DRIFT,"A new light gleams across the void,"
4208,STAR DRIFT,"And, awe-struck, we conceive the scene"
4209,STAR DRIFT,Of two vast solar orbs destroyed;
4210,STAR DRIFT,"By fearful impact changed again,"
4211,STAR DRIFT,"Unnumbered miles beyond our ken,"
4212,STAR DRIFT,To leagues of blazing hydrogen.
4213,STAR DRIFT,
4214,STAR DRIFT,"Before such marvels, what are we"
4215,STAR DRIFT,To plume ourselves in foolish pride?
4216,STAR DRIFT,Within that dim immensity
4217,STAR DRIFT,How many suns and earths have died!
4218,STAR DRIFT,"The tiny mote on which we stand,"
4219,STAR DRIFT,"However fair and finely planned,"
4220,STAR DRIFT,Is nothing but a grain of sand.
4221,STAR DRIFT,
4222,STAR DRIFT,"To-day, as through the ages gone,"
4223,STAR DRIFT,"By law impelled, by law restrained,"
4224,STAR DRIFT,"Suns, planets, systems,--all sweep on"
4225,STAR DRIFT,Toward bourns still dark and unexplained;
4226,STAR DRIFT,"Some bright with youth, some dull with age,"
4227,STAR DRIFT,Their varied colors well presage
4228,STAR DRIFT,Their distance from the final stage.
4229,STAR DRIFT,
4230,STAR DRIFT,For all are doomed at last to die!
4231,STAR DRIFT,"On heaven's blue sea each isle of fire,"
4232,STAR DRIFT,"Of all that now enchant the eye,"
4233,STAR DRIFT,Must finally in gloom expire;
4234,STAR DRIFT,"Though all may still roll on, unseen,"
4235,STAR DRIFT,"As blackened cinders, while between"
4236,STAR DRIFT,"Dark, lifeless planets intervene."
4237,STAR DRIFT,
4238,STAR DRIFT,And then? The mind sinks back in dread!
4239,STAR DRIFT,"Such burnt-out worlds may well appal,"
4240,STAR DRIFT,"If they must still continue dead,"
4241,STAR DRIFT,And universal night end all;
4242,STAR DRIFT,"But, one by one, as speed shall fail,"
4243,STAR DRIFT,"Each may some rival mass assail,"
4244,STAR DRIFT,Till nebulas again prevail.
4245,STAR DRIFT,
4246,STAR DRIFT,But not for long! A refluent spurge
4247,STAR DRIFT,"Shall that destructive course reverse,"
4248,STAR DRIFT,And cause those sun-mists to converge
4249,STAR DRIFT,To mould another universe;
4250,STAR DRIFT,"Again shall constellations rise,"
4251,STAR DRIFT,"And suns and planets light the skies,"
4252,STAR DRIFT,And man regain his paradise.
4253,STAR DRIFT,
4254,STAR DRIFT,For thus with rhythmic sweep sublime
4255,STAR DRIFT,Swings Chaos on to Cosmos; then
4256,STAR DRIFT,"In ages, measureless by time,"
4257,STAR DRIFT,"Rolls Cosmos back to mist again,"
4258,STAR DRIFT,"In one stupendous ebb and flow,"
4259,STAR DRIFT,"As aeons come and aeons go,"
4260,STAR DRIFT,With all their freight of weal and woe.
4261,STAR DRIFT,
4262,STAR DRIFT,"Hard, cruel, hopeless? It may be."
4263,STAR DRIFT,We know too little to decide;
4264,STAR DRIFT,Yet hope that o'er that starlit sea
4265,STAR DRIFT,"Some steadfast, God-directed tide"
4266,STAR DRIFT,"Will one day bear us to a shore,"
4267,STAR DRIFT,"Where we shall find our lost once more,"

4570,MY GARDEN,"""All this is mine, my very own""!"
4571,MY GARDEN,
4572,MY GARDEN,"Then with a chill, like that which steals"
4573,MY GARDEN,"Across the vale at set of sun,"
4574,MY GARDEN,"A solemn thought the truth reveals,--"
4575,MY GARDEN,How transient is the prize thus won!
4576,MY GARDEN,How short a time my lease can run!
4577,MY GARDEN,
4578,MY GARDEN,Before I thought this garden fair
4579,MY GARDEN,"And from its beauty rapture drew,"
4580,MY GARDEN,"How many others breathed its air,"
4581,MY GARDEN,"And, glorying in its matchless view,"
4582,MY GARDEN,Had plucked its roses wet with dew!

4585,MY GARDEN,"And fill the breeze with odors sweet,"
4586,MY GARDEN,Two thousand years and more ago

4599,MY GARDEN,"Across this corner of life's stage,--"
4600,MY GARDEN,"The Pagan, Christian, bard and sage."
4601,MY GARDEN,
4602,MY GARDEN,"Each one in turn called thee his own,"
4603,MY GARDEN,And deemed thee his submissive slave;
4604,MY GARDEN,"But, when a few short years had flown,"
4605,MY GARDEN,Of all thy wealth what could he save?
4606,MY GARDEN,At most thou gavest him a grave!
4607,MY GARDEN,
4608,MY GARDEN,"Ephemeral creatures of a day,"
4609,MY GARDEN,"We move like insects on thy soil,"
4610,MY GARDEN,And wear our little lives away

4614,MY GARDEN,"A few more Springs thy buds shall quicken,"
4615,MY GARDEN,"A few more Summers bring thy bloom,"
4616,MY GARDEN,A few more Autumn suns shall thicken

4618,MY GARDEN,When I for strangers must make room!
4619,MY GARDEN,
4620,MY GARDEN,When other eyes shall see the vision
4621,MY GARDEN,"Of Rotheck's pyramid of snow,"
4622,MY GARDEN,And watch the roseate hues elysian
4623,MY GARDEN,"Creep over it at evening's glow,"
4624,MY GARDEN,As o'er its crest the sun sinks low.
4625,MY GARDEN,
4626,MY GARDEN,Another then will pluck the flowers
4627,MY GARDEN,Whose seeds my loving hand hath sown;
4628,MY GARDEN,"Another, through the mid-day hours,"
4629,MY GARDEN,Will hear the honey bee's dull drone
4630,MY GARDEN,Where other roses shall have blown.
4631,MY GARDEN,
4632,MY GARDEN,These mountains then will still be lifting
4633,MY GARDEN,Their ice-crowned summits to the sky;
4634,MY GARDEN,The fleecy clouds will still be drifting
4635,MY GARDEN,Above their peaks and pastures high;
4636,MY GARDEN,But they will heed not where I lie.
4637,MY GARDEN,
4638,MY GARDEN,Even thou wilt never miss thy master!
4639,MY GARDEN,"Thy vines and flowers will bloom the same,"
4640,MY GARDEN,"The season's round will move no faster,"
4641,MY GARDEN,"No bud will quench its torch of flame,"
4642,MY GARDEN,And naught will change here but a name.
4643,MY GARDEN,
4644,MY GARDEN,Yet all who shall with joy succeed me
4645,MY GARDEN,"In their turn must thy charms resign,"
4646,MY GARDEN,"When, as to all who now precede me,"
4647,MY GARDEN,Death shall have made the fatal sign
4648,MY GARDEN,To join the ever-lengthening line.
4649,MY GARDEN,
4650,MY GARDEN,"We ""owners,"" then, are but thy tenants"
4651,MY GARDEN,Despite our purchase and our pride;
4652,MY GARDEN,To thee what is our transient presence?
4653,MY GARDEN,Thou carest not if we abide
4654,MY GARDEN,"Among thy roses, or have died."
4655,MY GARDEN,
4656,MY GARDEN,"Hence, let me drain in fullest measure"
4657,MY GARDEN,Thy cup of pure Tyrolean wine!
4658,MY GARDEN,To-day at least I hold thy treasure;
4659,MY GARDEN,To-day with truth I call thee mine;

5669,EVENING ON LAKE COMO,A skiff glides by on slender wings
5670,EVENING ON LAKE COMO,With scarce a ripple in its wake;
5671,EVENING ON LAKE COMO,"And pleasure-boats, their canvas furled,"
5672,EVENING ON LAKE COMO,Float idly in an ideal world.
5673,EVENING ON LAKE COMO,
5674,EVENING ON LAKE COMO,The swan-like steamers come and go;
5675,EVENING ON LAKE COMO,The ruffled water finds its rest;
5676,EVENING ON LAKE COMO,The snow-peaks catch a ruddy glow
5677,EVENING ON LAKE COMO,From crimsoned cloudlets in the west;
5678,EVENING ON LAKE COMO,"And, trembling on the tranquil air,"
5679,EVENING ON LAKE COMO,Steals forth the vesper-call to prayer.
5680,EVENING ON LAKE COMO,
5681,EVENING ON LAKE COMO,"Oh, peerless strand! I yearn no more"
5682,EVENING ON LAKE COMO,To mingle with the maddened throng;
5683,EVENING ON LAKE COMO,"Enough for me this wave-kissed shore,"
5684,EVENING ON LAKE COMO,"The vesper-bell, the fountain's song,"
5685,EVENING ON LAKE COMO,"The sunlit sail, the Alpine glow,"
5686,EVENING ON LAKE COMO,And storied towers of long ago.
5687,EVENING ON LAKE COMO,
5688,EVENING ON LAKE COMO,Between me and the world's unrest
5689,EVENING ON LAKE COMO,The lake's broad leagues of water lie;
5690,EVENING ON LAKE COMO,Above my wave-protected nest
5691,EVENING ON LAKE COMO,Serenely bends a cloudless sky;
5692,EVENING ON LAKE COMO,And homeward from life's stormy sea
5693,EVENING ON LAKE COMO,The dreams of youth come back to me.

5700,DELIO PATRI,"(Inscription on an altar-fragment, found on the Island of Lake Como,"
5701,DELIO PATRI,"1910, and belonging formerly to a temple of Delian Apollo,--the ""Delian"
5702,DELIO PATRI,"Father,""--which no doubt existed there.)"
5703,DELIO PATRI,
5704,DELIO PATRI,Once more Lake Como's storied isle
5705,DELIO PATRI,Reveals the Roman past!
5706,DELIO PATRI,Again a stone of classic style
5707,DELIO PATRI,The spade hath upward cast;
5708,DELIO PATRI,How can such relics thus endure
5709,DELIO PATRI,Two thousand years of sepulture?
5710,DELIO PATRI,
5711,DELIO PATRI,More eagerly than those who toil
5712,DELIO PATRI,"For nuggets of mere gold,"
5713,DELIO PATRI,We seize and rescue from the soil
5714,DELIO PATRI,"This monument of old,--"
5715,DELIO PATRI,"An altar-fragment, much defaced,"
5716,DELIO PATRI,Yet on whose surface words are traced.
5717,DELIO PATRI,
5718,DELIO PATRI,With reverent hands we cleanse from grime
5719,DELIO PATRI,"The legend chiselled there,"
5720,DELIO PATRI,"Which now, triumphant over time,"
5721,DELIO PATRI,"Still proves the sculptor's care,"
5722,DELIO PATRI,Engraved when on this wave-girt hill
5723,DELIO PATRI,The Pagan gods were potent still.
5724,DELIO PATRI,
5725,DELIO PATRI,'As on their own peculiar page
5726,DELIO PATRI,The fingers of the blind
5727,DELIO PATRI,"Decipher truths of every age,"
5728,DELIO PATRI,"As mind communes with mind,"
5729,DELIO PATRI,"So, one by one, these letters spell"
5730,DELIO PATRI,A name the ancient world knew well.
5731,DELIO PATRI,
5732,DELIO PATRI,"For ""Delio Patri"" heads the lines"
5733,DELIO PATRI,"Inscribed upon this stone,"
5734,DELIO PATRI,And instantly the mind divines
5735,DELIO PATRI,"What, else, had been unknown,"
5736,DELIO PATRI,Since that familiar name makes clear
5737,DELIO PATRI,Apollo once was worshipped here;
5738,DELIO PATRI,
5739,DELIO PATRI,Perhaps because the spot suggests
5740,DELIO PATRI,"That other tiny isle,"
5741,DELIO PATRI,Upon whose shore forever rests
5742,DELIO PATRI,"The Sun-God's tender smile,--"
5743,DELIO PATRI,"Fair Delos, where, one fabled morn,"
5744,DELIO PATRI,Both he and Artemis were born.
5745,DELIO PATRI,
5746,DELIO PATRI,"Beneath, the donor's name is placed,"
5747,DELIO PATRI,And lower still we read
5748,DELIO PATRI,"In characters, now half effaced,"
5749,DELIO PATRI,The motive for his deed;--
5750,DELIO PATRI,"""Onesimus this altar reared"
5751,DELIO PATRI,"To One he gratefully revered."""
5752,DELIO PATRI,
5753,DELIO PATRI,"Faith, grateful reverence,--these are traits"
5754,DELIO PATRI,"Worth more than rank or fame,"
5755,DELIO PATRI,And what this brief inscription states
5756,DELIO PATRI,"Does honor to his name,"
5757,DELIO PATRI,And makes us wish still more to know
5758,DELIO PATRI,Of him who built here long ago.
5759,DELIO PATRI,
5760,DELIO PATRI,"""And is this all?"" the cynic sneers,"
5761,DELIO PATRI,"""The remnant of a shrine?"""
5762,DELIO PATRI,Alas for him who never hears
5763,DELIO PATRI,Or heeds the world divine
5764,DELIO PATRI,And in this fragment fails to see
5765,DELIO PATRI,A stepping-stone to Deity!
5766,DELIO PATRI,
5767,DELIO PATRI,"The Sun-God's shrines in ruins lie,"
5768,DELIO PATRI,But not the glorious sun!
5769,DELIO PATRI,A thousand transient faiths may die.
5770,DELIO PATRI,"All prototypes of One,"
5771,DELIO PATRI,Since under every form and name
5772,DELIO PATRI,Their essence still remains the same.

5778,ACQUA FREDDA,
5779,ACQUA FREDDA,By Acqua Fredda's cloister-wall
5780,ACQUA FREDDA,"I pause to feel the mountain breeze,"
5781,ACQUA FREDDA,And watch the shadows eastward fall
5782,ACQUA FREDDA,From immemorial cypress trees.
5783,ACQUA FREDDA,
5784,ACQUA FREDDA,"Like arms outstretched to bless and pray,"
5785,ACQUA FREDDA,Those dusky phantoms downward creep
5786,ACQUA FREDDA,"To where, by Lenno's curving bay,"
5787,ACQUA FREDDA,The peaceful village seems to sleep;
5788,ACQUA FREDDA,
5789,ACQUA FREDDA,While mirrored peaks of stainless snow
5790,ACQUA FREDDA,"Turn crimson 'neath the farther shore,"
5791,ACQUA FREDDA,And here and there the sunset glow
5792,ACQUA FREDDA,Threads diamonds on a dripping oar.
5793,ACQUA FREDDA,
5794,ACQUA FREDDA,"But now a tremor breaks the spell,"
5795,ACQUA FREDDA,"And stirs to life the languid air,--"
5796,ACQUA FREDDA,"It is the convent's vesper-bell,--"
5797,ACQUA FREDDA,The plaintive call to evening prayer;
5798,ACQUA FREDDA,
5799,ACQUA FREDDA,That prayer which rises like a sigh
5800,ACQUA FREDDA,"From every sorrow-laden breast,"
5801,ACQUA FREDDA,"When twilight dims the garish sky,"
5802,ACQUA FREDDA,And day is dying in the west.
5803,ACQUA FREDDA,
5804,ACQUA FREDDA,Ave Maria! we who miss
5805,ACQUA FREDDA,"A mother's love, a mother's care,"
5806,ACQUA FREDDA,"Implore thee, bring us to that bliss"
5807,ACQUA FREDDA,We fondly hope with thee to share!
5808,ACQUA FREDDA,
5809,ACQUA FREDDA,"How sweet and clear, how soft and low"
5810,ACQUA FREDDA,"Those vesper orisons are sung,"
5811,ACQUA FREDDA,"In Rome's grand speech of long ago,"
5812,ACQUA FREDDA,"Forever old, forever young!"
5813,ACQUA FREDDA,
5814,ACQUA FREDDA,"And those who chant,--that exiled band,"
5815,ACQUA FREDDA,"Expelled from France with scorn and hate,"
5816,ACQUA FREDDA,How fare they in this foreign land?
5817,ACQUA FREDDA,Is life for them disconsolate?
5818,ACQUA FREDDA,
5819,ACQUA FREDDA,"Have they escaped the sight of pain,"
5820,ACQUA FREDDA,"Of social strife, of hopeless tears?"
5821,ACQUA FREDDA,"Does life's dark problem grow more plain,"
5822,ACQUA FREDDA,As pass in prayer the tranquil years?
5823,ACQUA FREDDA,
5824,ACQUA FREDDA,I know not; dare not ask of them;
5825,ACQUA FREDDA,Their souls are read by God alone;
5826,ACQUA FREDDA,"But he who would their lives condemn,"
5827,ACQUA FREDDA,Should pause before he cast a stone.
5828,ACQUA FREDDA,
5829,ACQUA FREDDA,"So full is life of hate and greed,"
5830,ACQUA FREDDA,"So vain the world's poor tinselled show,"
5831,ACQUA FREDDA,What wonder that some souls have need
5832,ACQUA FREDDA,To flee from all its sin and woe?
5833,ACQUA FREDDA,
5834,ACQUA FREDDA,"I would not join them; yet, in truth,"
5835,ACQUA FREDDA,"I feel, in leaving them at prayer,"
5836,ACQUA FREDDA,"That something precious of my youth,"

5845,THE POSTERN GATE,Beneath whose ivied wall
5846,THE POSTERN GATE,A lake's blue wavelets murmur
5847,THE POSTERN GATE,"As evening shadows fall,--"
5848,THE POSTERN GATE,
5849,THE POSTERN GATE,"A garden, whose leafy windows"
5850,THE POSTERN GATE,Frame visions of Alpine snow
5851,THE POSTERN GATE,On peaks that burn to crimson
5852,THE POSTERN GATE,In sunset's afterglow.
5853,THE POSTERN GATE,
5854,THE POSTERN GATE,"And there, in its sweet seclusion,"
5855,THE POSTERN GATE,"I built me a mansion fair,"
5856,THE POSTERN GATE,With many a classic statue
5857,THE POSTERN GATE,"And Eastern relic rare,"
5858,THE POSTERN GATE,
5859,THE POSTERN GATE,"And volumes, whose precious pages"
5860,THE POSTERN GATE,"Hold all that the wise have said,--"
5861,THE POSTERN GATE,"The latest among the living,"
5862,THE POSTERN GATE,The greatest among the dead.
5863,THE POSTERN GATE,
5864,THE POSTERN GATE,And I sat in those fragrant arbors
5865,THE POSTERN GATE,"Of laurel and palm and pine,"
5866,THE POSTERN GATE,And held in the tranquil twilight
5867,THE POSTERN GATE,My darling's hand in mine;
5868,THE POSTERN GATE,
5869,THE POSTERN GATE,"And said ""We will here be happy,"
5870,THE POSTERN GATE,And let the mad world go;
5871,THE POSTERN GATE,"Its gold no longer tempts us,"
5872,THE POSTERN GATE,Still less do its pomp and show;
5873,THE POSTERN GATE,
5874,THE POSTERN GATE,"""No more shall its cares annoy us,"
5875,THE POSTERN GATE,And under these stately trees
5876,THE POSTERN GATE,With Nature and Art and Letters
5877,THE POSTERN GATE,"Our souls shall take their ease."""
5878,THE POSTERN GATE,
5879,THE POSTERN GATE,"But a brood of griefs pursued us,"
5880,THE POSTERN GATE,Like evil birds of prey;
5881,THE POSTERN GATE,"They lodged in the trees' tall branches,"
5882,THE POSTERN GATE,They shadowed the cloudless day;
5883,THE POSTERN GATE,
5884,THE POSTERN GATE,"They flew to the darkened casement,"
5885,THE POSTERN GATE,"And beat on the wind-swept shade,"
5886,THE POSTERN GATE,And oft in the sleepless midnight
5887,THE POSTERN GATE,We listened and were afraid;
5888,THE POSTERN GATE,
5889,THE POSTERN GATE,And daily came the tidings
5890,THE POSTERN GATE,"Of folly and crime and woe,"
5891,THE POSTERN GATE,And one by one kept dying
5892,THE POSTERN GATE,The friends of long ago.
5893,THE POSTERN GATE,
5894,THE POSTERN GATE,"For the Past is ever one's master,"
5895,THE POSTERN GATE,"And Memory mocks at space,"
5896,THE POSTERN GATE,"And Trouble travels with us,"
5897,THE POSTERN GATE,However swift our pace;
5898,THE POSTERN GATE,
5899,THE POSTERN GATE,"And envy is always envy,"
5900,THE POSTERN GATE,"Though called by a foreign name,"
5901,THE POSTERN GATE,"And perfidy, greed, and malice"
5902,THE POSTERN GATE,Are everywhere the same.
5903,THE POSTERN GATE,
5904,THE POSTERN GATE,I thought I had left behind me
5905,THE POSTERN GATE,"That gloomy realm of care,"
5906,THE POSTERN GATE,"But really one never leaves it,"
5907,THE POSTERN GATE,Its shadow is everywhere.
5908,THE POSTERN GATE,
5909,THE POSTERN GATE,So I learned at last the lesson
5910,THE POSTERN GATE,"That walls, and gates, and keys"
5911,THE POSTERN GATE,Can never exclude life's sorrows;
5912,THE POSTERN GATE,They enter as they please.
5913,THE POSTERN GATE,
5914,THE POSTERN GATE,And if we ever acquire
5915,THE POSTERN GATE,"The perfect life we crave,"
5916,THE POSTERN GATE,A subtle warning tells us
5917,THE POSTERN GATE,Its background is the grave.
5918,THE POSTERN GATE,
5919,THE POSTERN GATE,"Perhaps I have almost reached it,"
5920,THE POSTERN GATE,"For when I am walking late,"
5921,THE POSTERN GATE,I see a shrouded stranger
5922,THE POSTERN GATE,Beside my postern gate;
5923,THE POSTERN GATE,
5924,THE POSTERN GATE,And a sudden chill creeps o'er me
5925,THE POSTERN GATE,"At sight of that figure grim,"
5926,THE POSTERN GATE,For I fancy that he is waiting
5927,THE POSTERN GATE,For me in the twilight dim;
5928,THE POSTERN GATE,
5929,THE POSTERN GATE,And I know he will one day beckon
5930,THE POSTERN GATE,"With gesture of command,"
5931,THE POSTERN GATE,And I shall follow him mutely.
5932,THE POSTERN GATE,"Away to the Silent Land,"
5933,THE POSTERN GATE,
5934,THE POSTERN GATE,And all that I here have treasured
5935,THE POSTERN GATE,"In fountain, and tree, and stone"
5936,THE POSTERN GATE,"Will pass to the hands of others,"
5937,THE POSTERN GATE,Whom I have never known.
5938,THE POSTERN GATE,
5939,THE POSTERN GATE,Hence over his sombre features
5940,THE POSTERN GATE,"There flickers a ghostly smile,"
5941,THE POSTERN GATE,"As if he would say, ""What matter?"
5942,THE POSTERN GATE,Your cares are not worth while;
5943,THE POSTERN GATE,
5944,THE POSTERN GATE,"""The trouble which gives you anguish,"
5945,THE POSTERN GATE,"The woes o'er which you weep,"
5946,THE POSTERN GATE,Will all be soon forgotten
5947,THE POSTERN GATE,"In my long, dreamless sleep."
5948,THE POSTERN GATE,
5949,THE POSTERN GATE,"""Enjoy the fleeting moment;"
5950,THE POSTERN GATE,"I cannot always wait,"
5951,THE POSTERN GATE,And the glow of the coming sunset
5952,THE POSTERN GATE,"Is gilding the postern gate."""

5962,UNDINE,Mounting the moon-silvered steps of my gate?
5963,UNDINE,"What is the cause of this passionate strain,"

5965,UNDINE,
5966,UNDINE,"Near to the lake, and surmounting the lawn,"

5974,UNDINE,Fall from the rampart in undulant lines;

5977,UNDINE,"Up to the garden, to woo and to take"

5979,UNDINE,
5980,UNDINE,"Boldly Love's wavelets now leap to the land,"

5983,UNDINE,White gleam their feet on its background of green;
5984,UNDINE,"Yet the old parapet, mossy and gray,"
5985,UNDINE,Never is reached by their glittering spray.
5986,UNDINE,
5987,UNDINE,"Hear you that music, half song and half sigh?"
5988,UNDINE,Sylph-like Undine is making reply:--
5989,UNDINE,"""Though I so motionless sit here above,"
5990,UNDINE,I am not deaf to thy pleadings of love;

5992,UNDINE,Only to thee shall my nature be known.
5993,UNDINE,
5994,UNDINE,"""Men who behold me, praise merely my art,"
5995,UNDINE,Never suspecting I too have a heart;
5996,UNDINE,Under the marble the world cannot see
5997,UNDINE,All I am keeping there only for thee;
5998,UNDINE,Secrets of love are of all the most sweet;
5999,UNDINE,Mine I will whisper to thee when we meet.
6000,UNDINE,
6001,UNDINE,"""Under the wall thou hast bravely assailed,"
6002,UNDINE,"Under the vines, where thy wavelets have failed,"
6003,UNDINE,"Passes this fountain; though cradled in snows,"
6004,UNDINE,Straight to thy waters it secretly flows;

6007,UNDINE,

6011,UNDINE,"'Tis but a mask, for her spirit is gone,--"
6012,UNDINE,"Gone on that crystalline path to the deep,"

6514,THE CASCADE,"Two marble statues stand,--"
6515,THE CASCADE,The silver sheen
6516,THE CASCADE,"Of the pool between,--"
6517,THE CASCADE,One form on either hand.
6518,THE CASCADE,
6519,THE CASCADE,One of the pair
6520,THE CASCADE,"Is a woman fair,"
6521,THE CASCADE,"With parted, smiling lips;"
6522,THE CASCADE,For her each hour
6523,THE CASCADE,"A honied flower,"
6524,THE CASCADE,And she the bee that sips.
6525,THE CASCADE,
6526,THE CASCADE,"The other, a faun,"
6527,THE CASCADE,From whom is gone
6528,THE CASCADE,The power to frankly smile;
6529,THE CASCADE,"For whom each day,"
6530,THE CASCADE,"As it drags away,"
6531,THE CASCADE,Makes life still less worth while.
6532,THE CASCADE,
6533,THE CASCADE,The face of the one
6534,THE CASCADE,"Is like the sun,"
6535,THE CASCADE,"With its warmth, and light, and cheer;"
6536,THE CASCADE,But the faun looks down
6537,THE CASCADE,"With ugly frown,"
6538,THE CASCADE,And his lips retain a sneer.
6539,THE CASCADE,
6540,THE CASCADE,"Youth and age,"
6541,THE CASCADE,Child and sage!
6542,THE CASCADE,The former with life unknown;
6543,THE CASCADE,The latter burnt
6544,THE CASCADE,"By lessons learnt,"
6545,THE CASCADE,With a heart now turned to stone.
6546,THE CASCADE,
6547,THE CASCADE,"Yet the torrent speeds,"
6548,THE CASCADE,And never heeds
6549,THE CASCADE,The statues' smiles or sneers;
6550,THE CASCADE,"They come and go,"
6551,THE CASCADE,But the water's flow
6552,THE CASCADE,Has lasted a thousand years.

6562,BIRD SLAUGHTER,No sportsmen can molest thee here.
6563,BIRD SLAUGHTER,
6564,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"Without, they doubtless still await thee,"
6565,BIRD SLAUGHTER,And scan with eager eyes the sky;
6566,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"Sweet, winsome thing! how can they hate thee?"
6567,BIRD SLAUGHTER,Why should they wish to see thee die?
6568,BIRD SLAUGHTER,
6569,BIRD SLAUGHTER,So limp and helpless! wilt thou never
6570,BIRD SLAUGHTER,Recover from thy fear and flight?
6571,BIRD SLAUGHTER,How breathless was thy last endeavor
6572,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"To reach this shelter, when in sight!"
6573,BIRD SLAUGHTER,
6574,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"Thou tremblest still, as I approach thee;"
6575,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"Do I, too, seem like all the rest?"
6576,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"Thy timid, liquid eyes reproach me ..."
6577,BIRD SLAUGHTER,Alas! there's blood upon thy breast.
6578,BIRD SLAUGHTER,
6579,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"Nay, fear not, birdling! let me gently"
6580,BIRD SLAUGHTER,Uplift and hold thee in my hand;
6581,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"Thou gazest on me so intently,"
6582,BIRD SLAUGHTER,Thou must my motive understand.
6583,BIRD SLAUGHTER,
6584,BIRD SLAUGHTER,Thy downy breast is pierced and bleeding;
6585,BIRD SLAUGHTER,This wing will never rise again;
6586,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"In vain thy look, so wild and pleading!"
6587,BIRD SLAUGHTER,I cannot cure or ease thy pain.
6588,BIRD SLAUGHTER,
6589,BIRD SLAUGHTER,Too well the hunters have succeeded;
6590,BIRD SLAUGHTER,Thy little life is ebbing fast;
6591,BIRD SLAUGHTER,My presence now is all unheeded;
6592,BIRD SLAUGHTER,'Tis over; ... thou art dead at last.
6593,BIRD SLAUGHTER,
6594,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"Yet thus, within my garden dying,"
6595,BIRD SLAUGHTER,Thy fate hath caused me less regret
6596,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"Than that of all thy comrades, lying"
6597,BIRD SLAUGHTER,Half dead and mangled in the net!
6598,BIRD SLAUGHTER,
6599,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"Where are they all, who crossed so gladly"
6600,BIRD SLAUGHTER,The lofty Alps to seek the sun?
6601,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"Still lives thy mate, to mourn thee sadly,"
6602,BIRD SLAUGHTER,Or is her life-course also run?
6603,BIRD SLAUGHTER,
6604,BIRD SLAUGHTER,Within the voiceless empyrean
6605,BIRD SLAUGHTER,No birds are passing on the breeze;
6606,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"No songster lifts its joyous paean,"
6607,BIRD SLAUGHTER,And silent stand my empty trees;
6608,BIRD SLAUGHTER,
6609,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"For at the base of every mountain,"
6610,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"Where southward-moving birds repose,"
6611,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"In every grove, at every fountain,"
6612,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"Lurk merciless, insatiate foes."
6613,BIRD SLAUGHTER,
6614,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"With cruel craft those foes surround them,"
6615,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"Ensnaring hundreds in a day,"
6616,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"Indifferent if they tear and wound them,"
6617,BIRD SLAUGHTER,Proud only of the heaps they slay.
6618,BIRD SLAUGHTER,
6619,BIRD SLAUGHTER,What care these brutes if songs of rapture
6620,BIRD SLAUGHTER,From thrush and lark are no more heard?
6621,BIRD SLAUGHTER,What matter if their modes of capture
6622,BIRD SLAUGHTER,Denude the land of every bird?
6623,BIRD SLAUGHTER,
6624,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"Whole regions, where they once abounded,"
6625,BIRD SLAUGHTER,Are now as silent as the tomb;
6626,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"The birds have vanished,--slain or wounded,"
6627,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"Pursued, by thousands, to their doom."
6628,BIRD SLAUGHTER,
6629,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"Meanwhile, since Earth itself is blighted,"
6630,BIRD SLAUGHTER,The Nemesis of Nature wakes;
6631,BIRD SLAUGHTER,Her flawless balance must be righted;
6632,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"If Ceres gives, ... she also takes!"
6633,BIRD SLAUGHTER,
6634,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"Still worse, a moral degradation"
6635,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"Thus cradled, vitiates the race;"
6636,BIRD SLAUGHTER,Among the rising generation
6637,BIRD SLAUGHTER,A lust for slaughter grows apace.
6638,BIRD SLAUGHTER,
6639,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"Even children kill the birds thus captured,--"
6640,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"And, since none censures or withstands,"
6641,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"They seize the tiny skulls, enraptured"
6642,BIRD SLAUGHTER,To crush them in their blood-smeared hands!
6643,BIRD SLAUGHTER,
6644,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"See yonder lad with tethered linnet,"
6645,BIRD SLAUGHTER,Its frail legs raw from rasping strings!
6646,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"A carriage comes,--he flings within it"
6647,BIRD SLAUGHTER,The tortured bird ... to sell its wings!
6648,BIRD SLAUGHTER,
6649,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"And oft as it may be rejected,"
6650,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"The little victim, mad with thirst,"
6651,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"Is jerked back, well-nigh vivisected,"
6652,BIRD SLAUGHTER,Till pain and hunger do their worst.
6653,BIRD SLAUGHTER,
6654,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"Beware, harsh man and heartless woman!"
6655,BIRD SLAUGHTER,Beneath you swells a threatening flood;
6656,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"If you and yours remain inhuman,"
6657,BIRD SLAUGHTER,It yet may drown you in your blood.
6658,BIRD SLAUGHTER,
6659,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"You smile, and call this sentimental;"
6660,BIRD SLAUGHTER,You will not smile in later times!
6661,BIRD SLAUGHTER,"For cruelty, so fundamental,"
6662,BIRD SLAUGHTER,Already breeds the worst of crimes.

6668,THE IRON CROWN,
6669,THE IRON CROWN,"On the classic shore of Como,"
6670,THE IRON CROWN,"'Neath a headland steep and bold,"
6671,THE IRON CROWN,"Which, though leaden at the dawning,"
6672,THE IRON CROWN,"In the sunset turns to gold,"
6673,THE IRON CROWN,"Nestles beautiful Varenna,"
6674,THE IRON CROWN,Still invested with renown
6675,THE IRON CROWN,By the legend that connects it
6676,THE IRON CROWN,With the Lombards' Iron Crown.
6677,THE IRON CROWN,
6678,THE IRON CROWN,Far above it on the mountain
6679,THE IRON CROWN,"Stands the castle, old and gray,"
6680,THE IRON CROWN,With its battlements in ruin
6681,THE IRON CROWN,And its towers in decay;
6682,THE IRON CROWN,But a subtle charm still lingers
6683,THE IRON CROWN,"Round that residence sublime,"
6684,THE IRON CROWN,And the beauty of its story
6685,THE IRON CROWN,Is triumphant over time.
6686,THE IRON CROWN,
6687,THE IRON CROWN,"As we trace its ancient pavement,"
6688,THE IRON CROWN,"As we tread its roofless halls,"
6689,THE IRON CROWN,How alluring is the figure
6690,THE IRON CROWN,Which this castle still recalls!
6691,THE IRON CROWN,For 'tis Queen Theodelinda
6692,THE IRON CROWN,"Whom its ruined arches frame,"
6693,THE IRON CROWN,And the passing breeze seems laden
6694,THE IRON CROWN,With the music of her name.
6695,THE IRON CROWN,
6696,THE IRON CROWN,As we gaze from ivied ramparts
6697,THE IRON CROWN,"On the storied lake below,"
6698,THE IRON CROWN,We forget the world about us
6699,THE IRON CROWN,"For the world of long ago,"
6700,THE IRON CROWN,When the Lombards had descended
6701,THE IRON CROWN,"From the mountains to the plain,"
6702,THE IRON CROWN,And all Italy lay mourning
6703,THE IRON CROWN,For the thousands of her slain;
6704,THE IRON CROWN,
6705,THE IRON CROWN,"When their brave, ambitious leader,"
6706,THE IRON CROWN,Not content to make his home
6707,THE IRON CROWN,"By these northern lakes of beauty,"
6708,THE IRON CROWN,Had resolved to capture Rome!
6709,THE IRON CROWN,For no longer could her legions
6710,THE IRON CROWN,"His resistless course withstand,"
6711,THE IRON CROWN,"And the road lay open, southward,"
6712,THE IRON CROWN,To the conquest of the land.
6713,THE IRON CROWN,
6714,THE IRON CROWN,When his valiant host stood ready
6715,THE IRON CROWN,"And impatient for the start,"
6716,THE IRON CROWN,What reversed their king's decision?
6717,THE IRON CROWN,What so changed the warlord's heart?
6718,THE IRON CROWN,'Twas the passionate entreaty
6719,THE IRON CROWN,"Of his wife,--a Christian queen;"
6720,THE IRON CROWN,'Twas the conquest of the pagan
6721,THE IRON CROWN,By the lowly Nazarene.
6722,THE IRON CROWN,
6723,THE IRON CROWN,Through her prayers Rome's agèd Pontiff
6724,THE IRON CROWN,From the threatened doom was freed;
6725,THE IRON CROWN,By her aid the Church was strengthened
6726,THE IRON CROWN,As the king professed its creed;
6727,THE IRON CROWN,"And Saint Peter's great successor,"
6728,THE IRON CROWN,"Thus preserved from grievous loss,"
6729,THE IRON CROWN,"Gave to her, his faithful daughter,"
6730,THE IRON CROWN,A true relic of the Cross.
6731,THE IRON CROWN,
6732,THE IRON CROWN,What to pious Theodelinda
6733,THE IRON CROWN,Could be recompense more sweet
6734,THE IRON CROWN,"Than the nail, forever sacred,"
6735,THE IRON CROWN,That once pierced her Saviour's feet?
6736,THE IRON CROWN,"Which, when rounded to a circlet,"
6737,THE IRON CROWN,"(To fine wire beaten down,)"
6738,THE IRON CROWN,Then became the precious basis
6739,THE IRON CROWN,Of the Lombards' Iron Crown.
6740,THE IRON CROWN,
6741,THE IRON CROWN,Through the ages that have followed
6742,THE IRON CROWN,What a line of the Renowned
6743,THE IRON CROWN,"Have been proud to wear this emblem,"
6744,THE IRON CROWN,"As they, each in turn, were crowned!"
6745,THE IRON CROWN,"Charlemagne, Charles Fifth, Napoleon,"
6746,THE IRON CROWN,"German Kaisers by the score,"
6747,THE IRON CROWN,"And at last poor King Umberto,"
6748,THE IRON CROWN,Basely slain at Monza's door!
6749,THE IRON CROWN,
6750,THE IRON CROWN,Since that coronet was fashioned
6751,THE IRON CROWN,Fifteen centuries have passed
6752,THE IRON CROWN,"O'er the castle by Lake Como,"
6753,THE IRON CROWN,Where the good queen breathed her last;
6754,THE IRON CROWN,"But the Crown is still at Monza,"
6755,THE IRON CROWN,And its iron basic line
6756,THE IRON CROWN,Tells the world of human glory
6757,THE IRON CROWN,And the death of the Divine.

7067,TRIPOLI,Who is stretching out his hand

7069,TRIPOLI,On the strand!
7070,TRIPOLI,Should he perish in the strife
7071,TRIPOLI,"Under Afric's burning sky,"
7072,TRIPOLI,There were nothing left in life--
7073,TRIPOLI,She must die.
7074,TRIPOLI,

7099,TRIPOLI,"To the woman seated there,"
7100,TRIPOLI,"With the tears upon her cheek,"

7163,TRIPOLI,
7164,TRIPOLI,"To the churchyard, near the bay,"
7165,TRIPOLI,"Went the mother in her grief,"
7166,TRIPOLI,For her soul was moved to pray
7167,TRIPOLI,For relief;
7168,TRIPOLI,"And deep sobs convulsed her breast,"
7169,TRIPOLI,"As she knelt upon the sod,"
7170,TRIPOLI,"Where her husband lay at rest,"
7171,TRIPOLI,Safe in God.
7172,TRIPOLI,
7173,TRIPOLI,"For the boy was o'er the sea,"
7174,TRIPOLI,Whom she rocked upon her knee;
7175,TRIPOLI,"He had gone to Tripoli,"
7176,TRIPOLI,Tripoli!
7177,TRIPOLI,
7178,TRIPOLI,She was buried yesterday
7179,TRIPOLI,"With her husband, side by side;"
7180,TRIPOLI,Ere two months had passed away
7181,TRIPOLI,She had died!
7182,TRIPOLI,For one morning she had read
7183,TRIPOLI,"Of her son among the slain,"
7184,TRIPOLI,And they saw her old gray head
7185,TRIPOLI,Sink in pain.
7186,TRIPOLI,
7187,TRIPOLI,Nevermore across the sea
7188,TRIPOLI,Will he come to Italy!
7189,TRIPOLI,"He was killed in Tripoli,"
7190,TRIPOLI,Tripoli!
7191,TRIPOLI,
7192,TRIPOLI,There was nothing more to tell
7193,TRIPOLI,Of a lad so little known;
7194,TRIPOLI,"He was reckoned ""one who fell,"""
7195,TRIPOLI,That alone.
7196,TRIPOLI,Was he wounded? Did he lie
7197,TRIPOLI,Long ill-treated by the foe?
7198,TRIPOLI,And not know!
7199,TRIPOLI,
7200,TRIPOLI,"Yes, he lies beyond the sea!"
7201,TRIPOLI,(Can it be that _that_ is he?)
7202,TRIPOLI,"In the sands of Tripoli,"
7203,TRIPOLI,Tripoli!
7204,TRIPOLI,
7205,TRIPOLI,"She had asked for nothing more,"
7206,TRIPOLI,"But in silence slowly failed,"
7207,TRIPOLI,"Dreaming ever of the shore,"
7208,TRIPOLI,Whence he sailed.
7209,TRIPOLI,"Till her face, so wan and white,"
7210,TRIPOLI,"Flushed at last with sweet surprise,"
7211,TRIPOLI,And a strangely tender light
7212,TRIPOLI,Filled her eyes.
7213,TRIPOLI,
7214,TRIPOLI,"Then for her was ""no more sea""!"
7215,TRIPOLI,She had found the soul set free

7267,LEO,But did not dream that he would die!
7268,LEO,And how could I explain
7269,LEO,That I would come again?
7270,LEO,
7271,LEO,"At first he mourned, as dogs will mourn"
7272,LEO,"A life-long master they adore,"
7273,LEO,Till in his mind the fear was born
7274,LEO,That he should never see me more.
7275,LEO,
7276,LEO,"Ah! then, on every boat intent,"
7277,LEO,"He watched the crowd upon the pier,"
7278,LEO,While every look and motion meant
7279,LEO,"""Will _he_ not come? Is _he_ not here?"""
7280,LEO,
7281,LEO,"At last he merely raised his head,"
7282,LEO,"To see the steamers passing by,"
7283,LEO,"Then sank again upon his bed,"
7284,LEO,"And heaved a long-drawn, plaintive sigh;"
7285,LEO,For how could one explain
7286,LEO,That I would come again?
7287,LEO,
7288,LEO,"I hastened back by sea and land,"
7289,LEO,Forced homeward by remorse and fear;
7290,LEO,"But no glad barking swept the strand,"
7291,LEO,Nor did he meet me on the pier!
7292,LEO,
7293,LEO,"I climbed the steps with footsteps fleet,"
7294,LEO,"And then beheld him near the wall,"
7295,LEO,"Though tottering, still upon his feet,"
7296,LEO,And creeping toward me down the hall.
7297,LEO,
7298,LEO,"No wish had he to sulk or blame,"
7299,LEO,"Nor did he need to understand,"
7300,LEO,"But simply loved me just the same,--"
7301,LEO,In silence licking face and hand.
7302,LEO,
7303,LEO,In silence? What could this portend?
7304,LEO,Such muteness he had never shown;
7305,LEO,Was he so very near the end?
7306,LEO,"Ah, Leo, had I only known!"
7307,LEO,
7308,LEO,"For his grand eyes, so large and bright,"
7309,LEO,"Though turned, through sound, my form to find,"
7310,LEO,Were totally devoid of sight;
7311,LEO,He faced me in the darkness ... blind!
7312,LEO,
7313,LEO,"What could such gloom have been to him,"
7314,LEO,"As weeks and months had crept away,"
7315,LEO,"While all the outer world grew dim,"
7316,LEO,Till endless night eclipsed the day!
7317,LEO,
7318,LEO,What had it meant to him to wake
7319,LEO,And mid familiar things to grope?
7320,LEO,"To hear old sounds on shore and lake,"
7321,LEO,Yet wander darkly without hope!
7322,LEO,
7323,LEO,"But now, his head upon my knee,"
7324,LEO,He tried in various ways to show
7325,LEO,"That, though my face he could not see,"
7326,LEO,He knew the voice of long ago.
7327,LEO,"Yes, now it was quite plain"
7328,LEO,That I had come again.
7329,LEO,
7330,LEO,"Within my arms he breathed his last,"
7331,LEO,In my embrace his noble head
7332,LEO,"Drooped back, and left to me ... the Past,"
7333,LEO,With tender memories of the dead.
7334,LEO,
7335,LEO,"He lies beneath the stately trees,"
7336,LEO,"Whose ample shade he loved the best,"
7337,LEO,"Mid flowers, whose perfume every breeze"
7338,LEO,Wafts lightly o'er his place of rest.
7339,LEO,
7340,LEO,Yet somehow still I watch and wait
7341,LEO,"For him, as he once watched for me;"
7342,LEO,At every footstep near my gate
7343,LEO,"I look, his bounding form to see."
7344,LEO,
7345,LEO,"Good-night? ... Good-bye! for I must leave thee,"
7346,LEO,My boat is waiting on the shore;
7347,LEO,"May I not hope that it will grieve thee,"
7348,LEO,When thou shalt see me here no more?
7349,LEO,
7350,LEO,"Such thoughts, I know, to-day are flouted;"
7351,LEO,"""Have statues souls?"" the cynic sneers;"
7352,LEO,"But I am happier to have doubted,"
7353,LEO,And loved thee thus these many years.
7354,LEO,
7355,LEO,"Behind the form is the ideal,"
7356,LEO,"Forever high, forever true;"
7357,LEO,"Behind the false exists the real,"
7358,LEO,Known only to the favored few.
7359,LEO,
7360,LEO,Not all can hear the music stealing
7361,LEO,From out that lightly-lifted flute;
7362,LEO,To those devoid of kindred feeling
7363,LEO,Its melody is always mute.
7364,LEO,
7365,LEO,But thou to me hast been a token
7366,LEO,"Of classic legend, wrought in stone;"
7367,LEO,"In thee the thread of Art, unbroken,"
7368,LEO,Made all the storied past mine own.
7369,LEO,
7370,LEO,"And I have felt, still brooding o'er thee,"
7371,LEO,"The old-time Genius of the Place,"
7372,LEO,"Aware of those who still adore thee,"
7373,LEO,"Unchanged by time, or creed, or race."
7374,LEO,
7375,LEO,Through thee came also inspiration
7376,LEO,"For many a rare, poetic thought;"
7377,LEO,"And oh, how much of resignation"
7378,LEO,"Thy sweet, unchanging smile hath taught!"
7379,LEO,
7380,LEO,"Though thine own past hath had its sorrow,"
7381,LEO,"Though all thy sylvan friends have fled,"
7382,LEO,"Thou still canst smile at every morrow,"
7383,LEO,"For Nature lives, though Pan is dead."
7384,LEO,
7385,LEO,Thou didst not grieve with futile wailing
7386,LEO,"When altars crumbled far and near,"
7387,LEO,"When gods were scoffed, and faith was failing,"
7388,LEO,And worship lessened year by year.
7389,LEO,
7390,LEO,"Above thee still rose lofty mountains,"
7391,LEO,"Before thee lay the lake divine,"
7392,LEO,"Around thee sang the crystal fountains,--"
7393,LEO,"With all these treasures, why repine?"
7394,LEO,
7395,LEO,"Religions changed, and shrines were banished,"
7396,LEO,"Years slipped away, men came and went,"
7397,LEO,"But thou, whatever pleasures vanished,"
7398,LEO,With what thou hadst wast still content.

8098,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,Ta ra! Boom boom! A regiment is coming down the street;
8099,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,From every side an eager throng is hurrying to greet
8100,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"From overflowing sidewalk and densely crowded square,"
8101,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"A brilliant, uniformed cortège whose music fills the air;"
8102,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,For such a gorgeous spectacle is not seen every day;
8103,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,It gives the town a festival to view the fine array;
8104,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"All hearts are filled with happiness, and no one seems to lag,"
8105,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,When he has thus a chance to see the soldiers ... and the flag.
8106,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"The old retired officers, their hats like helmets worn,"
8107,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,Have thrust them gaily on one side at sound of drum and horn;
8108,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"The eldest, whose brave heart is stirred by that familiar strain,"
8109,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"Surmounts, with stifled sigh, his chair, a better view to gain;"
8110,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"Cafes, salons, mansards alike their windows open throw,"
8111,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,And pretty girls wear radiant smiles to greet the passing show.
8112,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"Ah, here they are! Yes, here they come! preceded by the boys,"
8113,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"Who imitate in fashion droll, yet with no actual noise,"
8114,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"But merely by the gesturing of finger or of hand,"
8115,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"The cymbals, flute, and (best of all) the trombones of the band."
8116,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"The babies even laugh and crow, upheld in nurses' arms,"
8117,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"And have no fear of trumpets loud, or the bass-drum's alarms."
8118,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,The pavement of the boulevard is struck in perfect time;
8119,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"Six hundred echoes blend in one, and make the scene sublime;"
8120,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"Six hundred hearts are throbbing there, imbued with martial pride;"
8121,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,Twelve hundred feet with rhythmic beat make but a single stride.
8122,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"United, too, are all the hearts of those whose eyes pursue"
8123,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,With admiration every line now passing in review.
8124,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"But when a gallant regiment appears thus on parade,"
8125,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"A little vain of its fine looks, and conscious of its grade,"
8126,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"Each soldier, (since a time of peace allows him to be gay),"
8127,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"Aspires to be attentive to the ladies on the way,"
8128,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"And stares at every pretty face, with no wish to be rude,"
8129,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"But, then, you know, a regiment is never quite ... a prude!"
8130,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"And this explains why Captain Short has said to Captain Tall,"
8131,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"Despite the order which enjoins strict silence upon all,"
8132,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,
8133,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"""A lovely girl!"" ""Is that so? Where?"" ""Beside the window there."""
8134,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"""By Jove! I'd like to know her. She is divinely fair!"""
8135,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"Then both a little thoughtfully move on with some regret,"
8136,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,And now the entire regiment the lovely girl has met;
8137,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,
8138,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"Across the broad, resplendent ranks she looks now left, now right,"
8139,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"Now straight before her, but as yet no smiles her features light;"
8140,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"More than one mounted officer, with flashing sabre, wheels"
8141,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"His well-groomed horse, and calls to him the sergeant at his heels;"
8142,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"And makes excuse of some detail, endeavoring the while,"
8143,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"Perhaps half consciously, to win the favor of a smile."
8144,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"In vain; the glance he hopes to gain, as hero of her heart,"
8145,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"Comes not; but rank forbids delay, he must at once depart."
8146,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"The Colonel even has remarked this charming thoughtful girl,"
8147,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,And gives to his fine gray moustache the customary twirl;
8148,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"A handsome man, with uniform whose gilded lustre shines"
8149,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,From clanking spur to epaulette with stars and golden lines;
8150,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,He knows how potent is the spell such ornaments impart
8151,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,To make of soldiers demi-gods in woman's gentle heart.
8152,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"""The Flag! The Flag!"" The crowd is thrilled to see it now advance!"
8153,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"Hail, Colors of the Fatherland! Hail, Banner of Fair France!"
8154,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"Hail, wounded emblem of the brave; blood-red, and heaven's blue,"
8155,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"And purest white,--the noble Flag, now waving in our view!"
8156,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,
8157,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"Standard sublime, that moves all hearts, as now thy form unrolls,"
8158,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"Our dead seem shrouded in thy folds, stirred by the breath of souls!"
8159,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"The color-bearer, young as Hope, and still a charming boy,"
8160,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"In rhythm to the beating hearts and symphony of joy,"
8161,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"Sways gently, as he bears it on, the emblem of a land"
8162,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,Whose sons will in united ranks all enemies withstand.
8163,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"The young lieutenant, on whose face the standard's shadow falls,"
8164,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"Knows well it makes him pass admired between those human walls,"
8165,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"And that its presence lifts him high above the rank and file,"
8166,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,And gains for him a sentiment worth many a pretty smile.
8167,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"""That girl has smiled"", the Colonel thinks, ""but on whom'? Who can tell?"""
8168,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"""It is the bearer of the flag, on whom her favor fell"","
8169,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"Exclaims the Captain, who then adds, ""Great Heavens! worse than this,"
8170,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"She has not only smiled, but now she really throws a kiss!"""
8171,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,
8172,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"The Colonel, somewhat bent with years, sits up and swells his chest;"
8173,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"""A charming girl"" a sergeant cries, and tries to look his best;"
8174,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"Each soldier, if a comrade laughs, a rival seems to fear;"
8175,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"The chief of a battalion looks, and makes his charger rear."
8176,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"While several soldiers thus assume an air of martial pride,"
8177,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"The color-bearer, whom the band has quite electrified,"
8178,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"Caresses with a trembling hand the down upon his lip,"
8179,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,In doing which he rashly lets the tattered banner dip.
8180,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"But she has seen within its folds, thus torn with shell and shot,"
8181,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"The soul of one she dearly loved, who, dead at Gravelotte,"
8182,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"Returned no more, but sleeps to-day within an unknown grave ..."
8183,THE KISS TO THE FLAG,"The maiden's kiss was for the Flag, the death-shroud of the brave."

8196,EMILY'S GRAVE,A cypress whispered in my ear
8197,EMILY'S GRAVE,That all was now neglected here;
8198,EMILY'S GRAVE,"""Emily's Grave"" was all I read;"
8199,EMILY'S GRAVE,Nothing more on the cross was said;

8201,EMILY'S GRAVE,"Nor date relieved the inscription terse,--"
8202,EMILY'S GRAVE,"""Emily's Grave""."
8203,EMILY'S GRAVE,"So strange this seemed, my blood turned cold"
8204,EMILY'S GRAVE,At thought of a tragedy never told.
8205,EMILY'S GRAVE,"The flowers, the grass, and the humming bees"
8206,EMILY'S GRAVE,"Were blithe and gay in the sun and breeze,"
8207,EMILY'S GRAVE,Yet no kind hand had ever strewn
8208,EMILY'S GRAVE,"Sweet flowers, where only weeds had grown,"
8209,EMILY'S GRAVE,And nothing brightened the lonely mound
8210,EMILY'S GRAVE,Whose edge was lost in the trodden ground.
8211,EMILY'S GRAVE,"At length to the churchyard gate I went,"
8212,EMILY'S GRAVE,"And asked of a woman old and bent,"
8213,EMILY'S GRAVE,"""Who was the girl, whose cross of stone"
8214,EMILY'S GRAVE,"Bears nothing save these words alone,--"
8215,EMILY'S GRAVE,"'Emily's Grave'?"""
8216,EMILY'S GRAVE,"""Alas!"" she answered, ""many a year"
8217,EMILY'S GRAVE,Hath passed since I beheld her bier;
8218,EMILY'S GRAVE,"She was young, and came from a humble nest,"
8219,EMILY'S GRAVE,"And credulous too, like all the rest;"
8220,EMILY'S GRAVE,So a stranger met her here one day
8221,EMILY'S GRAVE,And caught her in his net straightway.
8222,EMILY'S GRAVE,"He said he was rich, and she should shine"
8223,EMILY'S GRAVE,"Like a queen in his castle by the Rhine,"
8224,EMILY'S GRAVE,"And, winning her love, he took her hence"
8225,EMILY'S GRAVE,To where she found it was all pretence.
8226,EMILY'S GRAVE,"He had basely lied to the simple maid,"
8227,EMILY'S GRAVE,"And, wearying soon of a girl betrayed,"
8228,EMILY'S GRAVE,Abandoned her; then home once more
8229,EMILY'S GRAVE,"She came, to sink at her mother's door."
8230,EMILY'S GRAVE,"Of shame and grief she was quickly dead,"
8231,EMILY'S GRAVE,For here she could no more lift her head;
8232,EMILY'S GRAVE,"And her mother, wishing to efface"
8233,EMILY'S GRAVE,"All memory of her child's disgrace,"
8234,EMILY'S GRAVE,"Reared that small cross, to which she gave"

8590,RACHEL,"Light of the glorious, setting sun,"
8591,RACHEL,"Gilding the Syrian shore,"
8592,RACHEL,"Ere the bright, lingering day be done,"
8593,RACHEL,"Guide me to her whose heart, well won,"
8594,RACHEL,Holds me forevermore.
8595,RACHEL,
8596,RACHEL,"Moon, that hath spanned the silvered plain,"
8597,RACHEL,"Olivet's brow to kiss,"
8598,RACHEL,Lead her by memory's golden chain
8599,RACHEL,Back to the olive groves of Spain;
8600,RACHEL,Back to our days of bliss!
8601,RACHEL,
8602,RACHEL,"Star of the evening's darkening sky,"
8603,RACHEL,"Gemming the lonely hill,"
8604,RACHEL,"Whisper to her that I am nigh,"
8605,RACHEL,Waiting in hope for her reply;
8606,RACHEL,Tell her I love her still!
8607,RACHEL,
8608,RACHEL,"The song had ended; Rachel stood erect,"
8609,RACHEL,"Her pale lips parted breathlessly, her head"
8610,RACHEL,"Bent forward to receive the words, which came"
8611,RACHEL,Like grateful raindrops to a drooping flower;
8612,RACHEL,Her slender form was quivering with delight
8613,RACHEL,And sudden rush of feeling; she scarce knew
8614,RACHEL,"If this were all a dream, or if in truth"
8615,RACHEL,She heard Emanuel's welcome accents there;
8616,RACHEL,Her heart for that brief moment wanted naught
8617,RACHEL,To supplement its rapture; 'twas enough
8618,RACHEL,"To stand thus in expectancy, and know"
8619,RACHEL,The idol of her soul was drawing near.
8620,RACHEL,"At length her father touched her hand, and spoke;--"
8621,RACHEL,
8622,RACHEL,"""'Tis he, my Rachel; thy sweet power hath drawn"
8623,RACHEL,Thy lover o'er the sea! Again the dawn
8624,RACHEL,Of love and hope is kindled in thy face;
8625,RACHEL,The concentrated beauty of thy race
8626,RACHEL,Illumes thy features; now alas! I know
8627,RACHEL,That thy self-sacrifice hath cost thee woe
8628,RACHEL,Intenser than I thought; I too rejoice
8629,RACHEL,"To hear the music of Emanuel's voice,"
8630,RACHEL,Although I tremble lest his purpose be
8631,RACHEL,"To lure thee, Rachel, far away from me."""
8632,RACHEL,
8633,RACHEL,"His daughter, even in the thrill of bliss"
8634,RACHEL,"Which filled her throbbing heart, yet saw the pain"
8635,RACHEL,"That marked his closing words; and, turning, twined"
8636,RACHEL,Her arms about the old man's drooping neck;
8637,RACHEL,"""Dear Father, fear not that,"" she gently said;"
8638,RACHEL,"""Though it be true that ardent love hath led"
8639,RACHEL,"Emanuel to this distant Syrian shore,"
8640,RACHEL,Thy lot shall still be mine forevermore;
8641,RACHEL,"Doubt not thy faithful child, for none the less"
8642,RACHEL,'Twill be thy Rachel's greatest happiness
8643,RACHEL,At thy dear side to minister to thee;
8644,RACHEL,"For only death can come 'twixt thee and me!"""
8645,RACHEL,
8646,RACHEL,"She paused, and hid her face upon his breast;"
8647,RACHEL,"Her father clasped her fondly in his arms,"
8648,RACHEL,"And bent his cheek to hers, his whitened locks"
8649,RACHEL,On her dark tresses glistening like the snow.
8650,RACHEL,'Twas thus Emanuel found them; silently
8651,RACHEL,He stood before them in a dread suspense;
8652,RACHEL,His very soul seemed poised upon the word
8653,RACHEL,"Which left at last his trembling lips,--""Rachel!"""
8654,RACHEL,"She raised her head, and their bright, ardent eyes"
8655,RACHEL,Exchanged the voiceless language of the soul;
8656,RACHEL,A joy ineffable diffused its flush
8657,RACHEL,"O'er both their faces; yet she did not speak,"
8658,RACHEL,"But only clung the closer to her sire,"
8659,RACHEL,As if in fear to lose her self-control.
8660,RACHEL,At length Emanuel spoke in tones so charged
8661,RACHEL,With deep emotion that the very air
8662,RACHEL,Seemed tremulous with thoughts transcending speech;--
8663,RACHEL,
8664,RACHEL,"""Rachel, my more than life! Canst thou forgive"
8665,RACHEL,The momentary thought that I could live
8666,RACHEL,"Without thee? See, our separation ends!"
8667,RACHEL,"Henceforth I know no country, home or friends"
8668,RACHEL,"Save thine, my love! I gladly leave them all,"
8669,RACHEL,"Obedient to a higher, nobler call,--"
8670,RACHEL,The cry of my whole being to be near
8671,RACHEL,"Thee, thee, my Rachel, now so wholly dear,"
8672,RACHEL,That life without thee is but lingering death!
8673,RACHEL,Already with thee a diviner breath
8674,RACHEL,Of inspiration lifts my soul to gain
8675,RACHEL,"The purest, loftiest heights I can attain!"
8676,RACHEL,"Not to entice thee from thy father's care,"
8677,RACHEL,"Have I come hither, but to seek a share"
8678,RACHEL,"In that dear filial duty, and to give"
8679,RACHEL,"Love, loyalty and homage, while I live,"
8680,RACHEL,"To him, the honored hero of our race,"
8681,RACHEL,Beside whom here I also crave a place.
8682,RACHEL,"Not only do I plead my love anew,"
8683,RACHEL,But also thus lay open to thy view
8684,RACHEL,"The dearest wishes of my soul, and wait"
8685,RACHEL,"To learn thy answer. Do I come too late?"""
8686,RACHEL,
8687,RACHEL,"In doubt, 'twixt hope and fear, she raised her eyes"
8688,RACHEL,To read her fate in her lov'd father's face;
8689,RACHEL,"Who, taking her fair hands within his own,"
8690,RACHEL,"Advanced with her to where Emanuel stood,"
8691,RACHEL,And laid them in her lover's eager grasp.
8692,RACHEL,"With softened radiance, from their lonely paths,"
8693,RACHEL,"The far-off stars beheld their kneeling forms,"
8694,RACHEL,"While, with his hands in benediction raised,"
8695,RACHEL,The old man stood absorbed in silent prayer.
8696,RACHEL,
8697,RACHEL,*       *       *       *       *
8698,RACHEL,
8699,RACHEL,"The old, old story, ever new"
8700,RACHEL,Alike in Gentile and in Jew;
8701,RACHEL,For Love remains man's sovereign yet
8702,RACHEL,In Eden and on Olivet.
