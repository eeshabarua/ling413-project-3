95,PLYMOUTH,The Call of the Mountains
96,PLYMOUTH,
97,PLYMOUTH,Under the shade of the Kursaal veranda
98,PLYMOUTH,"Idly I follow the flight of the seagulls,"
99,PLYMOUTH,"Gleaming like snow when their wings catch the sunshine,"
100,PLYMOUTH,While from the palm-house adjacent is wafted
101,PLYMOUTH,"Music half drowned in a babel of voices,"
102,PLYMOUTH,Fitting the mode of this temple of follies.
103,PLYMOUTH,
104,PLYMOUTH,"Far though the mountains, their influence, ever"
105,PLYMOUTH,"Changeful in temper, from sombre to smiling,"
106,PLYMOUTH,"Constant in wileful and mystic allurement,"
107,PLYMOUTH,Rouses unrest and a strange fascination.
108,PLYMOUTH,
109,PLYMOUTH,Limpid and blue are the waters of Leman
110,PLYMOUTH,"Clear in the deepness, translucent and shining,"
111,PLYMOUTH,"Blue as the ether's ineffable azure,"
112,PLYMOUTH,Bright in the glow of the midsummer sunshine.
113,PLYMOUTH,"Cleaving the air with their palpitant pinions,"
114,PLYMOUTH,"Wheeling and drifting, the beautiful seagulls"
115,PLYMOUTH,"Fly with the grace of unconscious perfection,"
116,PLYMOUTH,Crying exultant and wild in a chorus.
117,PLYMOUTH,
118,PLYMOUTH,"Are you not fit for the realm of immortals,"
119,PLYMOUTH,To float on the winds of the gardens Elysian?
120,PLYMOUTH,Or must you hover a little while longer--
121,PLYMOUTH,Wandering souls in a state of probation--
122,PLYMOUTH,"Half-way uplifted beyond our defilement,"
123,PLYMOUTH,Half-way removed from the land of the blessed?
124,PLYMOUTH,
125,PLYMOUTH,"Far in the distance beyond the blue water,"
126,PLYMOUTH,"Rises the hoary old father of mountains,"
127,PLYMOUTH,"Rugged and scarred with antiquity's furrows,"
128,PLYMOUTH,Crowned with the snows of a million winters.
129,PLYMOUTH,"Low in the shade of his ponderous presence,"
130,PLYMOUTH,"Dappling the slopes, are the homesteads of peasants,"
131,PLYMOUTH,Each with its cloud of blue vapour ascending:
132,PLYMOUTH,And sweetly the bells across the green pastures
133,PLYMOUTH,"Answer each other with voices persistent,"
134,PLYMOUTH,Telling the herdsman the tale of his charges.
135,PLYMOUTH,Grim is the smile of the white-headed mountain
136,PLYMOUTH,"For toilers below in the slumbering valley,"
137,PLYMOUTH,"Grim is the glance with a touch of derision,"
138,PLYMOUTH,Seeming to say to his towering brothers--
139,PLYMOUTH,"Catogne and the broad-shouldered heights of the Midi,"
140,PLYMOUTH,"""Iguanodon,--Mastodon,--Man,--in their passing"
141,PLYMOUTH,"Serve but as signs on the path of the ages."""
142,PLYMOUTH,Softly the plash of the waters of Leman
143,PLYMOUTH,Sounds from the rough-tumbled stones at its margin:
144,PLYMOUTH,"Gently the zephyrs play over its surface,"
145,PLYMOUTH,Making it glitter with myriads of sparklets.
146,PLYMOUTH,Swiftly the barques trim their sails in the sunshine--
147,PLYMOUTH,"Sails high and slender that swell to the breezes,"
148,PLYMOUTH,White as the snow on the breast of the Jungfrau--
149,PLYMOUTH,Mirrored in whiteness upon the blue water.
150,PLYMOUTH,
151,PLYMOUTH,"As I sat watching the lake and the mountains,"
152,PLYMOUTH,"Slowly a haze like a curtain of muslin,"
153,PLYMOUTH,"Flimsy and fine like a texture of cobweb,"
154,PLYMOUTH,Drifted and rose till it shut out the bases
155,PLYMOUTH,"And bulk of the mountains across the still water,"
156,PLYMOUTH,Whilst high above it the crests and sierras
157,PLYMOUTH,"Stood out as castles and walls of enchantment,"
158,PLYMOUTH,"Raised in the air like king Solomon's city,"
159,PLYMOUTH,Held up aloft by invisible genii.
160,PLYMOUTH,"Then in the faintly drawn lines of escarpment,"
161,PLYMOUTH,"Battlements, pinnacles, turrets and bastions"
162,PLYMOUTH,"Sprang into being, and fancy, untrammelled,"
163,PLYMOUTH,"Pictured a palace with walls, and a fortress"
164,PLYMOUTH,"Beleaguered and stormed by a shadowy army,"
165,PLYMOUTH,Massed under pennons seen dim through the vapour.
166,PLYMOUTH,
167,PLYMOUTH,Over the drawbridge a desperate sortie
168,PLYMOUTH,Made by the knights of the castle invested
169,PLYMOUTH,Brings the foes quickly in conflict together.
170,PLYMOUTH,Plumes white and restless like foam on the breakers
171,PLYMOUTH,Drift to and fro with the tide of the battle;
172,PLYMOUTH,Falchions and maces and curtaxes gleaming
173,PLYMOUTH,"A moment aloft, strike sparks in descending"
174,PLYMOUTH,"On corslet and casque and dinted escutcheon,"
175,PLYMOUTH,"Whilst out of the contest, with stumbling footsteps"
176,PLYMOUTH,The wounded are led sore stricken and helpless.
177,PLYMOUTH,"Ladies in sarcenet, arabesque broidered"
178,PLYMOUTH,"With blossoms that climb fantastic in colour,--"
179,PLYMOUTH,Stiff flowers of blazonry's formal convention
180,PLYMOUTH,"That rise from the hem to the throat in profusion,"
181,PLYMOUTH,"Where carcanets flash on bosoms unquiet,--"
182,PLYMOUTH,"Look from their casements with eyes full of wonder,"
183,PLYMOUTH,"Down on the conflict that rages below them,"
184,PLYMOUTH,"Fierce in the shock and the heat of encounter,"
185,PLYMOUTH,"Hearing the war-cries and clashing of weapons,"
186,PLYMOUTH,"Winding of horns, and the groans of the dying."
187,PLYMOUTH,"Till all was lost in the thickening curtain,"
188,PLYMOUTH,Veiled by the mist were my golden romances.
189,PLYMOUTH,
190,PLYMOUTH,Once when a snowstorm swept over lake Leman
191,PLYMOUTH,"Filling the distance with wildly tossed snowflakes,"
192,PLYMOUTH,"I pictured a scene in the heart of the mountains,"
193,PLYMOUTH,"Hidden in shadows, unknown to the climber,"
194,PLYMOUTH,Out of the range of Humanity's footsteps.
195,PLYMOUTH,There is the cave where the slumbering ice god
196,PLYMOUTH,"Hides from the gaze of the wandering stranger,"
197,PLYMOUTH,"Shut in the depths of the mountain's recesses,"
198,PLYMOUTH,Rent long ago by the force of upheavals
199,PLYMOUTH,In the wild turmoil and labour of earthquake.
200,PLYMOUTH,"There sits the god of the cold everlasting,"
201,PLYMOUTH,Guarding the spirits of men who have perished
202,PLYMOUTH,In their endeavours to master the secrets
203,PLYMOUTH,Of paths that have never by footsteps been trodden.
204,PLYMOUTH,In the ice temple his figure majestic
205,PLYMOUTH,Looms from a throne that through aeons uncounted
206,PLYMOUTH,Has stood in the gloom and the silence eternal.
207,PLYMOUTH,Weird is the throng of the spirits in thraldom:
208,PLYMOUTH,"Silent they steal from their icy sepulture,"
209,PLYMOUTH,Slow-pacing figures unchanged and unchanging:
210,PLYMOUTH,"By violent death, swift, ruthless and lonely,"
211,PLYMOUTH,"Sentenced to wander for ever in darkness,"
212,PLYMOUTH,Pent in the masterful ice god's dominion.
213,PLYMOUTH,"Primitive hunters with flint-headed arrows,"
214,PLYMOUTH,Whose limited minds ignored the distinction
215,PLYMOUTH,"Engendered by knowledge, of good and of evil:"
216,PLYMOUTH,Acting by impulse and guided by instinct:
217,PLYMOUTH,"Living in caves like the bears and the foxes,"
218,PLYMOUTH,"Facing with cunning and courage their quarry,"
219,PLYMOUTH,"Guarding their women and feeding their children,"
220,PLYMOUTH,Almost as fierce as the creatures they hunted.
221,PLYMOUTH,"Men who came later throughout the long ages,"
222,PLYMOUTH,Wandering fugitives driven by fortune
223,PLYMOUTH,"Far from their homes to the wild desolation,"
224,PLYMOUTH,Slaves of illusion that lures to destruction:
225,PLYMOUTH,"Some with a love for adventure and daring,"
226,PLYMOUTH,"Some to escape from the ills that pursued them,"
227,PLYMOUTH,Some in response to the strong fascination
228,PLYMOUTH,"That calls from the heights of the untrodden mountains,"
229,PLYMOUTH,"All destined by fate, that watches unceasing,"
230,PLYMOUTH,"To die in the darkness forgotten for ever,"
231,PLYMOUTH,Pent in the ice god's immutable kingdom.
232,PLYMOUTH,
233,PLYMOUTH,"Wafted by breezes, my white-sailed felucca"
234,PLYMOUTH,Slipped through the blueness to where the grim stronghold
235,PLYMOUTH,Of Chillon keeps ever in grateful remembrance
236,PLYMOUTH,"The patriot Bonivard, champion of freedom."
237,PLYMOUTH,"The pillar of pain where, writhing in torment,"
238,PLYMOUTH,"The captives were scourged at cruelty's bidding,"
239,PLYMOUTH,"Is still to be seen, an eloquent witness."
240,PLYMOUTH,Tenantless now is the cavernous dungeon
241,PLYMOUTH,Where wretches awaited through darkness unending
242,PLYMOUTH,The dawn of their last and dreaded to-morrow.
243,PLYMOUTH,"Stripped of its horrors, the chamber of torture"
244,PLYMOUTH,"Echoes no more to the shrieks of its victims,"
245,PLYMOUTH,And death's grim abode where agony ended
246,PLYMOUTH,Is free from the crimes that redden its records.
247,PLYMOUTH,There by the column of stone in the dungeon
248,PLYMOUTH,Where Bonivard lay to pine through the seasons
249,PLYMOUTH,"Of six weary years, I mused on his story."
250,PLYMOUTH,"Undaunted by death's ever-threatening shadow,"
251,PLYMOUTH,"Unconquered though insolent tyranny triumphed,"
252,PLYMOUTH,"Chilled in the summer and frozen in winter,"
253,PLYMOUTH,"Famished, neglected and loaded with fetters,"
254,PLYMOUTH,"Yet borne up within by courage unflinching,"
255,PLYMOUTH,"Supported by Faith when Hope had departed,"
256,PLYMOUTH,"Scorning to murmur, he waited with patience."
257,PLYMOUTH,"Morning's faint light through the narrow embrasure,"
258,PLYMOUTH,The wandering cry of a sea-mew in freedom
259,PLYMOUTH,"Heightened the gloom of his roughly hewn prison,"
260,PLYMOUTH,Making a summons to death a deliverance.
261,PLYMOUTH,"Night fell about him in Stygian darkness,"
262,PLYMOUTH,"While the faint lap of the waters of Leman,"
263,PLYMOUTH,"Beating the ramparts with madding persistence,"
264,PLYMOUTH,Whispered despair in the still isolation.
265,PLYMOUTH,What were his thoughts when the vault of his prison
266,PLYMOUTH,Rang with glad cries in the glare of the torches?
267,PLYMOUTH,"Breaking the silence, dispelling the shadows"
268,PLYMOUTH,"That darkened his life and threatened his reason,"
269,PLYMOUTH,What were his thoughts at the moment of freedom?
270,PLYMOUTH,"When round him a tempest of passion was raging,"
271,PLYMOUTH,"An unloosened storm of passionate feeling,"
272,PLYMOUTH,When men incoherent and hoarse from the conflict
273,PLYMOUTH,"Fought for the honour of breaking his fetters,"
274,PLYMOUTH,"Leaving him breathless with hearty embraces,"
275,PLYMOUTH,"Weak and unmanned in the sudden revulsion,"
276,PLYMOUTH,"Carried away by the flood of emotion,"
277,PLYMOUTH,"With something unknown that stifled expression,"
278,PLYMOUTH,That silenced his voice and heaved in his bosom.
279,PLYMOUTH,
280,PLYMOUTH,"Strong is the spell of the dream-haunted mountains,"
281,PLYMOUTH,"Ruddy with gold in the glory of sunrise,"
282,PLYMOUTH,"Purple and silver and blue in the daytime,"
283,PLYMOUTH,"Tinged by the amethyst splendours of sunset,"
284,PLYMOUTH,"Gloomy, majestic and dark in the twilight,"
285,PLYMOUTH,"Mystic by moonlight, ethereal, airy,"
286,PLYMOUTH,"Changeful and fickle in hues as the opal,"
287,PLYMOUTH,"Under the mutable lights and the shadows,"
288,PLYMOUTH,Ever alluring with subtle attraction.
289,PLYMOUTH,
290,PLYMOUTH,"Far, far away are the waters of Leman"
291,PLYMOUTH,Whence I have fled at the call of the mountains.
292,PLYMOUTH,"Here in the valley where rushes a torrent,"
293,PLYMOUTH,"Constant and cold, be it summer or winter,"
294,PLYMOUTH,"A village lies hid and hither the climbers,"
295,PLYMOUTH,"Strangely alike in their eager impatience,"
296,PLYMOUTH,"Wearing the look of enwrapped expectation,"
297,PLYMOUTH,Pause ere they start on their perilous journey.
298,PLYMOUTH,"Hemming me round, the implacable mountains"
299,PLYMOUTH,"Shut out the world and confine me in durance,"
300,PLYMOUTH,"Bending my soul to the yoke of their bondage,"
301,PLYMOUTH,"Dwarfing my self and my little emotions,"
302,PLYMOUTH,Waking desire to escape limitations
303,PLYMOUTH,And barriers imposed by narrow horizons.
304,PLYMOUTH,"Rugged, majestic, they tower above me,"
305,PLYMOUTH,"As lonely and pensive I gaze in the torrent,"
306,PLYMOUTH,"Wondering now at the summons insistent,"
307,PLYMOUTH,"No longer in dreams and rovings of fancy,"
308,PLYMOUTH,"But weighted with impulse, defying resistance,"
309,PLYMOUTH,Rousing unrest like a spirit of evil.
310,PLYMOUTH,"So, as I linger awhile in the village,"
311,PLYMOUTH,Completely I know each day brings me nearer
312,PLYMOUTH,"To what lies beyond, in the regions of silence."
313,PLYMOUTH,
314,PLYMOUTH,"Now it is over.  The lights of the village,"
315,PLYMOUTH,"The children at play, the clink from the smithy,"
316,PLYMOUTH,"The gurgle and rush of the hurrying torrent,"
317,PLYMOUTH,"The rattle of wheels, the tinkle of cowbells,"
318,PLYMOUTH,The inn's open window whence converse in fragments
319,PLYMOUTH,"Floats out with the odours of beer and tobacco,"
320,PLYMOUTH,All welcome me back with familiar voices.
321,PLYMOUTH,Here time moves onward with rhythmic precision:
322,PLYMOUTH,"Breakfast and dinner, and bed for the darkness,"
323,PLYMOUTH,With Sunday to part one week from another:
324,PLYMOUTH,"Spring time and winter, the snow and the sunshine,"
325,PLYMOUTH,And sooner or later a cross in the churchyard.
326,PLYMOUTH,Time lacks proportion away in the mountains.
327,PLYMOUTH,What is a day or an hour or a lifetime
328,PLYMOUTH,Gauged by the ebb and the flow of the ages
329,PLYMOUTH,Shown in the tidemarks on crags prehistoric?
330,PLYMOUTH,"If, as men say, time is measured by heartbeats,"
331,PLYMOUTH,I wandered through years of vivid emotions.
332,PLYMOUTH,"Pelion and Ossa, by arrogant Titans"
333,PLYMOUTH,"Profanely uplifted to challenge Olympus,"
334,PLYMOUTH,Repeated themselves in the blueness above me.
335,PLYMOUTH,"Sunsets and dawns such as glowed on the marshes,"
336,PLYMOUTH,"Silurian haunts of the early creation,"
337,PLYMOUTH,"Long ere the age of humanity's advent,"
338,PLYMOUTH,Gleamed through the vapours and red exhalations
339,PLYMOUTH,Rising from bottomless pits to encolour
340,PLYMOUTH,"Weirdly the matrix, volcanic, primeval,"
341,PLYMOUTH,Riven and torn in the birth-throes of Cosmos.
342,PLYMOUTH,"Slippery ledges uneven and narrow,"
343,PLYMOUTH,"Through rarefied air that maddens the pulses,"
344,PLYMOUTH,"Treacherous footpaths inviting destruction,"
345,PLYMOUTH,Where fear in the heart disorders the senses.
346,PLYMOUTH,"Vertiginate chasms, abysmal, terrific,"
347,PLYMOUTH,"Unfathomed and sheer with never a foothold,"
348,PLYMOUTH,Compelling the gaze with cold fascination.
349,PLYMOUTH,Stretches of billowy acres of whiteness
350,PLYMOUTH,Dimming the eyes with their endless expanses;
351,PLYMOUTH,Ridges upstanding in ice walls cemented
352,PLYMOUTH,By glacial pressure of slow-moving masses.
353,PLYMOUTH,"Caverns with ice shapes, blue-tinted, translucent:"
354,PLYMOUTH,"Columns and altars and figures fantastic,"
355,PLYMOUTH,"Imagined in dreams or pictured in fever,"
356,PLYMOUTH,Softly illumed by the moonlight's reflection.
357,PLYMOUTH,"There is the haunt of the evil ice maidens,"
358,PLYMOUTH,"The servants of Death, who lure with their beauty,"
359,PLYMOUTH,"Who bathe in the stream of the glacier water,"
360,PLYMOUTH,"The glacial water that flows through the caverns,"
361,PLYMOUTH,Silent and deep as the river of Lethe.
362,PLYMOUTH,These memories hold me.  I live in a fever.
363,PLYMOUTH,"The air that I breathe, the influence round me"
364,PLYMOUTH,Are charged with a strange and volatile essence
365,PLYMOUTH,That throbs in my veins and quickens my breathing.
366,PLYMOUTH,"Held by the mountains, I languish in bondage"
367,PLYMOUTH,Under the masterful sway of their presence.
368,PLYMOUTH,"Restless though weary I dream of their perils,"
369,PLYMOUTH,"Slipping down chasms with death at the bottom,"
370,PLYMOUTH,"Or over the desolate ice fields I wander,"
371,PLYMOUTH,"Hopeless, forgotten and lost in the snowdrifts,"
372,PLYMOUTH,Wandering ever past hope of redemption.
373,PLYMOUTH,"Sometimes I swing with a pendulum's measure,"
374,PLYMOUTH,Fitfully swayed by the wind o'er a chasm
375,PLYMOUTH,"That gapes far below, relentless and cruel,"
376,PLYMOUTH,Conscious of all in the terrible moments
377,PLYMOUTH,That pass till I drop to the doom that is waiting
378,PLYMOUTH,"Far in the depths of the yawning crevasses,"
379,PLYMOUTH,And wake at the instant supreme of destruction.
380,PLYMOUTH,
381,PLYMOUTH,To-morrow at dawn I fly from the village
382,PLYMOUTH,Back to the peace of the waters of Leman.
383,PLYMOUTH,
384,PLYMOUTH,"Gone, gone at last, is the morbid obsession!"
385,PLYMOUTH,Gone to the shade in the regions of Limbo.
386,PLYMOUTH,"Far, far away, o'er the waters of Leman,"
387,PLYMOUTH,"Mistily outlined and faint in the distance,"
388,PLYMOUTH,"Threatening no longer, the dream-haunted mountains"
389,PLYMOUTH,Lazily whisper of rest and contentment.
390,PLYMOUTH,
391,PLYMOUTH,Softly the plash of the glittering fountain
392,PLYMOUTH,"Falls on the night with the scent of mimosa,"
393,PLYMOUTH,"Mingled with polyglot phrases and laughter,"
394,PLYMOUTH,Marking the pause 'twixt a waltz and mazurka.
395,PLYMOUTH,Soft are the lamps in the Kursaal rotunda
396,PLYMOUTH,Lighting discreetly the hall of lost footsteps
397,PLYMOUTH,"Whose gleaming mosaics are painted with garlands,"
398,PLYMOUTH,"Blossoms exotic, luxuriant, languid,"
399,PLYMOUTH,"Red as the souls of the people about them,"
400,PLYMOUTH,"Hinting at passions through crimson and purple,"
401,PLYMOUTH,Fitting the vogue of this temple of pleasure.
402,PLYMOUTH,On a divan in the hall where the idlers
403,PLYMOUTH,"Promenade slowly, in converse together,"
404,PLYMOUTH,"I sit all alone in calm contemplation,"
405,PLYMOUTH,Hearing the orchestra faint in the distance
406,PLYMOUTH,"And the croupier's voice from his chamber seductive,"
407,PLYMOUTH,"Parrot-like crying in stale iteration,"
408,PLYMOUTH,Summons and challenge across the green table.
409,PLYMOUTH,"Keen-eyed old gamesters who prowl round the players,"
410,PLYMOUTH,Seeking a pigeon to pluck at their leisure:
411,PLYMOUTH,Black-whiskered barons with blurred reputations
412,PLYMOUTH,Smirking at B. and his girls from Chicago:
413,PLYMOUTH,Swaggering captains at best detrimental:
414,PLYMOUTH,"A country-bred youth just come to a fortune,"
415,PLYMOUTH,Trying in vain to conceal his amazement:
416,PLYMOUTH,"Couples awaiting the Absolute's fiat,"
417,PLYMOUTH,Now in pursuit of a flying illusion:
418,PLYMOUTH,Hebrews from Frankfort and bankers from Paris
419,PLYMOUTH,Chatting to ladies resplendent in diamonds;
420,PLYMOUTH,"A burgess of London whose wife says: ""Disgraceful,"""
421,PLYMOUTH,But lingers to study Parisian fashions:
422,PLYMOUTH,"Gamblers inveterate bent to a system,"
423,PLYMOUTH,"Silent, unheeding, absorbed in their figures:"
424,PLYMOUTH,"Well-groomed young fellows, light-hearted and careless,"
425,PLYMOUTH,"Come for the dance and the fun of flirtation,"
426,PLYMOUTH,"Bright-eyed and merry, unconsciously breathing"
427,PLYMOUTH,The poisonous air of sepulchres whited.
428,PLYMOUTH,"Perdita, watchful and guardedly smiling,"
429,PLYMOUTH,"Trying to lessen the distance between us,"
430,PLYMOUTH,Wafts me a sign with a spray of verbena.
431,PLYMOUTH,"Is she an angel, a beast or a demon,"
432,PLYMOUTH,Or spirit incarnate that onward is passing
433,PLYMOUTH,To higher avatars by long transmigration?
434,PLYMOUTH,"Ah! how it warms one, this human deflection,"
435,PLYMOUTH,"This touch with familiar follies and foibles,"
436,PLYMOUTH,"After the limitless space of the aeons,"
437,PLYMOUTH,"Out of the measure of time as we know it,"
438,PLYMOUTH,"Far in the distant and echoless ages,"
439,PLYMOUTH,"Austere, and untouched by our passing emotions,"
440,PLYMOUTH,Where I have wandered in lonely remoteness
441,PLYMOUTH,Under the passionless spell of the mountains.
442,PLYMOUTH,
443,PLYMOUTH,"Cold and relentless, eternally lasting!"
444,PLYMOUTH,Silent inscriptions in cryptical cipher!
445,PLYMOUTH,"Unbroken record of time since creation,"
446,PLYMOUTH,Whose secret is hid from human conception.
447,PLYMOUTH,"How small are the things humanity prizes,"
448,PLYMOUTH,"The feverish joys of passion and pleasure,"
449,PLYMOUTH,That pass like a dream to dusky oblivion!
450,PLYMOUTH,How short is man's life compared with the ages
451,PLYMOUTH,"That frown from the face of the mystical mountains,"
452,PLYMOUTH,Far in the blue o'er the waters of Leman.
453,PLYMOUTH,
454,PLYMOUTH,
455,PLYMOUTH,
456,PLYMOUTH,
457,PLYMOUTH,The Old Manor House
458,PLYMOUTH,
459,PLYMOUTH,The rusted gates whose forgings fine
460,PLYMOUTH,"Enlace a gilded coronet,"
461,PLYMOUTH,"Now dim in lustreless decline,"
462,PLYMOUTH,Groaned as I passed the lichened shapes
463,PLYMOUTH,"Of rampant griffin on each side,"
464,PLYMOUTH,"Stiff with heraldic, stony pride."
465,PLYMOUTH,Then through the grass-grown drive I passed
466,PLYMOUTH,"With ancient oaks on either hand,"
467,PLYMOUTH,Throwing their shadows dark and vast
468,PLYMOUTH,Upon the bracken at their feet
469,PLYMOUTH,Where rabbits peeped in fear and ran
470,PLYMOUTH,From the rare sound of living man.
471,PLYMOUTH,For here no more the sumptuous train
472,PLYMOUTH,Displays the pomp of falconry;
473,PLYMOUTH,"No more, besprent with mire and rain,"
474,PLYMOUTH,The messenger-at-arms rides in:
475,PLYMOUTH,"Nor, with his retinue of knights"
476,PLYMOUTH,Some great man at the house alights.
477,PLYMOUTH,
478,PLYMOUTH,Above the portico
479,PLYMOUTH,"Of the great silent house,"
480,PLYMOUTH,"The quarterings' tinctures glow,"
481,PLYMOUTH,"Blazoning its history,"
482,PLYMOUTH,"From the old Sieur de Caulx,"
483,PLYMOUTH,Whose heavy Norman sword
484,PLYMOUTH,"Helped Harold's overthrow,"
485,PLYMOUTH,And whose long line of sons
486,PLYMOUTH,"Stretches, like a shadow,"
487,PLYMOUTH,"Thrown in the eventide,"
488,PLYMOUTH,Through the old folio
489,PLYMOUTH,Where illumined pages
490,PLYMOUTH,"Bravely the records show,"
491,PLYMOUTH,"Till the last, lonely heir"
492,PLYMOUTH,"Was carried down below,"
493,PLYMOUTH,To the cold marble vaults
494,PLYMOUTH,A century ago.
495,PLYMOUTH,
496,PLYMOUTH,"A gallery o'erlooks the hall,"
497,PLYMOUTH,A gallery where minstrels played
498,PLYMOUTH,"And with their lutes sweet music made,"
499,PLYMOUTH,"While from the weapons on the wall,"
500,PLYMOUTH,Reflected shone the lights that glowed
501,PLYMOUTH,Above the hospitable board
502,PLYMOUTH,"When each successive, generous lord"
503,PLYMOUTH,His loyalty or grandeur showed.
504,PLYMOUTH,"Kings feasted there with stately dames,"
505,PLYMOUTH,Ambassadors and Cardinals
506,PLYMOUTH,"Who, cheered with wine and madrigals,"
507,PLYMOUTH,Fed with their fancies amorous flames.
508,PLYMOUTH,And at some great eventful scene
509,PLYMOUTH,"Full many a dance the chamber graced,"
510,PLYMOUTH,"Pavanes and sarabands were paced,"
511,PLYMOUTH,And minuets when Anne was queen.
512,PLYMOUTH,
513,PLYMOUTH,"My footsteps echoing from the panelled walls,"
514,PLYMOUTH,"Stayed the long sleep of years,"
515,PLYMOUTH,"Stirring the thick, accumulated dust"
516,PLYMOUTH,"To movement in the ray of light that falls,"
517,PLYMOUTH,From a half-shuttered oriel which appears
518,PLYMOUTH,"Between the rafters, just"
519,PLYMOUTH,Where a stone mullion its carved apex rears.
520,PLYMOUTH,Faint voices whispered round me as I stood
521,PLYMOUTH,Spellbound and listening there:
522,PLYMOUTH,"The ghostly strains of melodies forgot,"
523,PLYMOUTH,The happy laughter of fair womanhood:
524,PLYMOUTH,"Children in noisy play, without a care:"
525,PLYMOUTH,"Fierce cries with passion hot,"
526,PLYMOUTH,"Triumphant some, and some wild with despair."
527,PLYMOUTH,
528,PLYMOUTH,"Leaving the chamber so haunted by voices,"
529,PLYMOUTH,"Fearful, I hastened to where the great staircase"
530,PLYMOUTH,Rears its proud height in a double ascension
531,PLYMOUTH,Till it is hid in the deepening shadows.
532,PLYMOUTH,"Stiffly upstanding on each chief baluster,"
533,PLYMOUTH,"Absently gaze the historical griffins,"
534,PLYMOUTH,Plunged in their silent and deep meditation.
535,PLYMOUTH,"Many a Caulx have they seen pass before them,"
536,PLYMOUTH,"Long generations in motley procession,"
537,PLYMOUTH,"Halting and feeble, the sick and the aged:"
538,PLYMOUTH,"Sanguine and joyous, the young and the hopeful:"
539,PLYMOUTH,"Manhood triumphant, crestfallen or thoughtless:"
540,PLYMOUTH,"Urbane and discreet, my lady's confessor:"
541,PLYMOUTH,"Stealthily creeping, the villainous traitor:"
542,PLYMOUTH,"Quick and impatient, the fortunate lover:"
543,PLYMOUTH,Children unconscious of aught but their playthings:
544,PLYMOUTH,"Nobles in ermine, and simpering ladies:"
545,PLYMOUTH,"Then, the one end of all human emotions,"
546,PLYMOUTH,"Slow-pacing figures who bear on their shoulders,"
547,PLYMOUTH,"Silenced for ever, some lord of the staircase."
548,PLYMOUTH,
549,PLYMOUTH,"The steward, from the all-pervading gloom,"
550,PLYMOUTH,"Flung wide the shutters of the drawing-room,"
551,PLYMOUTH,Showing a terrace graced with urn and faun
552,PLYMOUTH,"And steps that led to a neglected lawn,"
553,PLYMOUTH,Whilst rounded hill and valley far were seen
554,PLYMOUTH,Lit by the summer's radiating sheen.
555,PLYMOUTH,"The room's magnificence, its noble size"
556,PLYMOUTH,And faded splendour filled me with surprise.
557,PLYMOUTH,"A costly pierglass in its tarnished frame,"
558,PLYMOUTH,"Which once reflected gallant squire and dame,"
559,PLYMOUTH,Now with fidelity displayed the clear
560,PLYMOUTH,"And gleaming lustres of the chandelier,"
561,PLYMOUTH,"Pendent, with ten score sconces silver chased,"
562,PLYMOUTH,From the high ceiling which a master graced
563,PLYMOUTH,With courtly scenes wherein could be descried
564,PLYMOUTH,Ancestral figures in their pomp and pride.
565,PLYMOUTH,"The sunlight played on gilded girandole,"
566,PLYMOUTH,"On silver candlestick and stiff console,"
567,PLYMOUTH,All of that period when here befell
568,PLYMOUTH,"The scene on which the steward loves to dwell,"
569,PLYMOUTH,Showing the floor's dark stain of sombre red
570,PLYMOUTH,And how it came about that blood was shed.
571,PLYMOUTH,"I marked the punchbowls, full of leaves and dust,"
572,PLYMOUTH,"A slim sword, silver-hiked, flecked with rust:"
573,PLYMOUTH,"A daintily escutcheoned chiffonier,"
574,PLYMOUTH,Inlaid with shell and finished with veneer:
575,PLYMOUTH,"Timepieces silent, set in ormolu:"
576,PLYMOUTH,The damask screens of faded red and blue.
577,PLYMOUTH,"And, to enhance the chamber's stately air,"
578,PLYMOUTH,Great Chippendale had made each slender chair.
579,PLYMOUTH,"The stream of life, arrested, seemed to wait"
580,PLYMOUTH,A magic word to set it flowing straight.
581,PLYMOUTH,
582,PLYMOUTH,"Heated by wine and ombre-play,"
583,PLYMOUTH,"Two hundred years ago or more,"
584,PLYMOUTH,"Three gamblers, on a morning gray,"
585,PLYMOUTH,Quarrelled about a questioned score.
586,PLYMOUTH,
587,PLYMOUTH,"Two blades were soon engaged.  A tierce,"
588,PLYMOUTH,"Ill parried, stretched a swordsman low,"
589,PLYMOUTH,"Who lunged with failing point but fierce,"
590,PLYMOUTH,"And dying, dropped before his foe."
591,PLYMOUTH,
592,PLYMOUTH,And when the growing light of morn
593,PLYMOUTH,"Lit the Venetian mirror's face,"
594,PLYMOUTH,"He died, 'twixt pain and passion torn,"
595,PLYMOUTH,And left a curse upon the place.
596,PLYMOUTH,
597,PLYMOUTH,And from that day the records show
598,PLYMOUTH,"A slowly creeping, sure decline"
599,PLYMOUTH,"That, just a hundred years ago,"
600,PLYMOUTH,Ended the once illustrious line.
601,PLYMOUTH,
602,PLYMOUTH,Sometimes upon the dusky hour
603,PLYMOUTH,"That comes before the sun's first rays,"
604,PLYMOUTH,"When things occult display their power,"
605,PLYMOUTH,A strange light on the chamber plays
606,PLYMOUTH,
607,PLYMOUTH,"That is not of the earth or sky,"
608,PLYMOUTH,While hurrying footsteps come and go
609,PLYMOUTH,And then into the silence die
610,PLYMOUTH,With whispered mutterings hoarse and low.
611,PLYMOUTH,
612,PLYMOUTH,"A sliding panel, by the wainscot hid,"
613,PLYMOUTH,"Showed, in the unmarked thickness of the walls,"
614,PLYMOUTH,A narrow passage and a secret stair
615,PLYMOUTH,That brought us to the level of the moat.
616,PLYMOUTH,"Long dry and choked with bracken and with brier,"
617,PLYMOUTH,It made a rugged pathway to a court
618,PLYMOUTH,"Where stands the ruin of an ancient tower,"
619,PLYMOUTH,Fenced in with walls pierced by an entrance low.
620,PLYMOUTH,"""Here,"" said my guide, ""when James the first was king,"
621,PLYMOUTH,"""A daughter of the house, through three long years,"
622,PLYMOUTH,"""Was by her father close a prisoner kept"
623,PLYMOUTH,"""Because she would not wed the man he chose."
624,PLYMOUTH,"""Stern and unyielding, as became her race,"
625,PLYMOUTH,"""She set her will against her father's strength."
626,PLYMOUTH,"""Through all the time she saw no living face:"
627,PLYMOUTH,"""No sound of human voice, except her own,"
628,PLYMOUTH,"""Fell on her ear.  She nothing saw but clouds"
629,PLYMOUTH,"""That swept athwart the cold and pitiless sky,"
630,PLYMOUTH,"""And blinking stars at night that rose and set"
631,PLYMOUTH,"""Across the little window in the roof:"
632,PLYMOUTH,"""Then she went mad and on the stony walls"
633,PLYMOUTH,"""One day beat out her life in frenzied rage,"
634,PLYMOUTH,"""And refuge found beyond her father's power."""
635,PLYMOUTH,
636,PLYMOUTH,"Time passed, and it was late"
637,PLYMOUTH,When once again I stood
638,PLYMOUTH,"Outside the ancient gate,"
639,PLYMOUTH,"Where the stone griffins ramped,"
640,PLYMOUTH,Cold as relentless fate
641,PLYMOUTH,Changeless as destiny.
642,PLYMOUTH,
643,PLYMOUTH,"And I said: ""'Tis in vain,"
644,PLYMOUTH,"Guardians impassible,"
645,PLYMOUTH,That ye your watch maintain
646,PLYMOUTH,"Over the ghosts of Caulx,"
647,PLYMOUTH,While the years wax and wane
648,PLYMOUTH,Century by century.
649,PLYMOUTH,
650,PLYMOUTH,"""For behold!  I have been"
651,PLYMOUTH,Among them and have heard
652,PLYMOUTH,"Their voices, I have seen"
653,PLYMOUTH,With swift-discerning eyes
654,PLYMOUTH,Over their wide demesne
655,PLYMOUTH,"Of human history."""
656,PLYMOUTH,
657,PLYMOUTH,
658,PLYMOUTH,
659,PLYMOUTH,
660,PLYMOUTH,The Science Master
661,PLYMOUTH,
662,PLYMOUTH,"""We build,"" he said, ""on elemental things!"""
663,PLYMOUTH,And paused to glance around the silent class.
664,PLYMOUTH,"""On facts well ascertained which insight brings,"
665,PLYMOUTH,"""And which in due development must pass"
666,PLYMOUTH,"""From the first phase, remote, removed,"
667,PLYMOUTH,"""To the Effect.  Thus, link by link, we trace"
668,PLYMOUTH,"""The lengthening chain of Verity, full proved"
669,PLYMOUTH,"""By Knowledge, Reason, Logic, each in place."""
670,PLYMOUTH,It seemed conclusive to us students then.
671,PLYMOUTH,The man's prestige had weight.  Authority
672,PLYMOUTH,Made him for us above all other men;
673,PLYMOUTH,He was the head of our academy.
674,PLYMOUTH,"His calm assumption and incisive way,"
675,PLYMOUTH,"Admitting no alternative nor doubt,"
676,PLYMOUTH,"As he intoned his long familiar lay,"
677,PLYMOUTH,Made his pronouncements clear as if cut out
678,PLYMOUTH,"Of crystal, cold with mathematic test,"
679,PLYMOUTH,Through which he viewed complacently the span
680,PLYMOUTH,"And limit of all scientific quest,"
681,PLYMOUTH,Quite heedless of the growing range of man.
682,PLYMOUTH,"His narrow field so finished and complete,"
683,PLYMOUTH,His standards and his logic's hampering line
684,PLYMOUTH,"Look small where now the long perspectives meet,"
685,PLYMOUTH,Converging in a new horizon's shine.
686,PLYMOUTH,"All this was years ago.  What would he say,"
687,PLYMOUTH,"I wonder, if he could revisit us"
688,PLYMOUTH,"And, with the knowledge of the present day,"
689,PLYMOUTH,"See space and pain reduced to minimus,"
690,PLYMOUTH,"Electric currents hand in hand with steam,"
691,PLYMOUTH,"Men borne in ships across the trackless air,"
692,PLYMOUTH,The widening story of the earth's old scheme
693,PLYMOUTH,"Told in its strata, and, with arduous care,"
694,PLYMOUTH,"The age of man thrust back unfathomed years,"
695,PLYMOUTH,"New elements, a new chronology"
696,PLYMOUTH,And growing lore that year by year appears
697,PLYMOUTH,To show how distant is finality?
698,PLYMOUTH,It sets my fancy roving and I try
699,PLYMOUTH,In idle hours to think what may befall.
700,PLYMOUTH,"Naught seems impossible, no thought too high,"
701,PLYMOUTH,"No dream too mad, to realise it all."
702,PLYMOUTH,"What, for example, is the human mind?"
703,PLYMOUTH,"Whence comes it, great or small, at some man's birth?"
704,PLYMOUTH,"A fool's or sage's, base or all refined!"
705,PLYMOUTH,What holds it till his body turns to earth?
706,PLYMOUTH,And whither goes it with the failing breath?
707,PLYMOUTH,And is the Aura's essence to remain
708,PLYMOUTH,"Ever elusive at the hour of death,"
709,PLYMOUTH,To perish or another home attain?
710,PLYMOUTH,"Or, with close knowledge of man's growing germ,"
711,PLYMOUTH,"Shall we not train it and direct its course,"
712,PLYMOUTH,"As now we cultivate the floral sperm,"
713,PLYMOUTH,And simple weeds to complex beauty force?
714,PLYMOUTH,"Life is a thing of phases manifold,"
715,PLYMOUTH,"By shades diminishing from high to low,"
716,PLYMOUTH,"Man, protoplasm, beast, all we are told,"
717,PLYMOUTH,To perish in an equal overthrow.
718,PLYMOUTH,Our view of life at best is incomplete.
719,PLYMOUTH,"We judge by its effect and action, blind"
720,PLYMOUTH,"To its real essence, as to that we meet,"
721,PLYMOUTH,"Acting unseen, when wire to wire we bind."
722,PLYMOUTH,"Think of what might be, once this secret known,"
723,PLYMOUTH,"Full knowledge of Life's spark, and with the power"
724,PLYMOUTH,To rescue from Death's dark and silent zone
725,PLYMOUTH,The souls of some great men whose natures tower
726,PLYMOUTH,Above their fellows and can ill be spared
727,PLYMOUTH,From some great task far-reaching and benign.
728,PLYMOUTH,"I hear a reader say: ""This man has dared"
729,PLYMOUTH,"""To claim for us an attribute divine!"
730,PLYMOUTH,"""Our times are in God's hands.""  And I reply:"
731,PLYMOUTH,"We do not hesitate to take a life,"
732,PLYMOUTH,"The claims of social law to satisfy,"
733,PLYMOUTH,And punish men whose minds with crime are rife.
734,PLYMOUTH,"What then more fitting, given the knowledge there,"
735,PLYMOUTH,"To lengthen lives that worthy ends fulfil,"
736,PLYMOUTH,And measure by new standards just and fair
737,PLYMOUTH,The worth of life as it is good or ill?
738,PLYMOUTH,Have we exhausted chemistry's domain?
739,PLYMOUTH,Squeezed dry the elements we say we know?
740,PLYMOUTH,And does the spinning universe contain
741,PLYMOUTH,No more our theories to overthrow?
742,PLYMOUTH,How far does gravitation serve our needs--
743,PLYMOUTH,"The force that keeps each planet in its place,"
744,PLYMOUTH,"Resistless, constant, yet with varying speeds,"
745,PLYMOUTH,For ever acting in unbounded space?
746,PLYMOUTH,Some day perhaps pent man will learn to brave
747,PLYMOUTH,"An alien atmosphere, and, from afar,"
748,PLYMOUTH,"Of weight and distance master, not the slave,"
749,PLYMOUTH,Bring us new wisdom from some distant star.

752,PLYMOUTH,
753,PLYMOUTH,
754,PLYMOUTH,Through the Centuries
755,PLYMOUTH,
756,PLYMOUTH,"While yet the Saxons ruled, a puissant Thane"
757,PLYMOUTH,Made with his unkempt band of mounted spears
758,PLYMOUTH,A seizin of a hide of forest land
759,PLYMOUTH,"Whereon he built a house of ample size,"
760,PLYMOUTH,"With dining-hall and bowers and sleeping-lofts,"
761,PLYMOUTH,And stables shutting in a stone-paved yard:
762,PLYMOUTH,And round the whole he set a ponderous fence
763,PLYMOUTH,Of sharpened stakes fast bound with metal bands.
764,PLYMOUTH,"And ""Yan, the Wulf,"" for thus the Thane was known,"
765,PLYMOUTH,"Called the place ""Wulfden"" in his savage tongue."
766,PLYMOUTH,"And here, year after year, he lived at ease,"
767,PLYMOUTH,"Oft making sallies for a cattle raid,"
768,PLYMOUTH,"Or fighting with some other such as he,"
769,PLYMOUTH,"To come back weary at the fall of night,"
770,PLYMOUTH,"Driving a herd before him, and his men"
771,PLYMOUTH,Sweating beneath the spoil of plundered foes.
772,PLYMOUTH,"Once as he sat at supper in his hall,"
773,PLYMOUTH,"Bemused with mead and satisfied with food,"
774,PLYMOUTH,There came a wandering bedesman to his gate
775,PLYMOUTH,"Craving permission ""in Fayre Jesu's name"""
776,PLYMOUTH,To build a church of stone within the shade
777,PLYMOUTH,"Of his protection.  And, in generous mood,"
778,PLYMOUTH,The Thane gave gruff assent; and time slipped by.
779,PLYMOUTH,
780,PLYMOUTH,"Then William swept the land, and, to reward"
781,PLYMOUTH,"One of his knights, gave him the Wulf's demesne"
782,PLYMOUTH,"To hold in fee, and on the Saxon's land"
783,PLYMOUTH,"Arose a fortress with embattled walls,"
784,PLYMOUTH,"With donjon, keep and moat and tilting-yard,"
785,PLYMOUTH,To hold in thraldom all the country-side.
786,PLYMOUTH,"But still was left the little Saxon church,"
787,PLYMOUTH,Unchanged save that the Norman owner gave
788,PLYMOUTH,"New consecration in his patron's name,"
789,PLYMOUTH,"St. Martinus of Tours, a warrior saint"
790,PLYMOUTH,Who guarded through the centuries his race.
791,PLYMOUTH,
792,PLYMOUTH,Then in the War of Roses came the crash
793,PLYMOUTH,That brought extinction to the feudal name
794,PLYMOUTH,And desolation to its crumbling home.
795,PLYMOUTH,"And yet, though scarred by time and gray with age,"
796,PLYMOUTH,The little church of Saxon days remained
797,PLYMOUTH,The emblem of a never-dying faith.
798,PLYMOUTH,
799,PLYMOUTH,The years rolled by and then there came a day
800,PLYMOUTH,"Which gave a new possessor to the place,"
801,PLYMOUTH,A nobleman in favour with that queen
802,PLYMOUTH,Who loved a witty tongue and ready sword
803,PLYMOUTH,When coupled with good looks and brave attire.
804,PLYMOUTH,"He built a great Elizabethan pile,"
805,PLYMOUTH,"The ground-plan shaped to form the royal E,"
806,PLYMOUTH,Conforming to the fashion of the times
807,PLYMOUTH,When loyalty spoke even from silent stone.
808,PLYMOUTH,"And he, to please his lady's pious whim,"
809,PLYMOUTH,"(Though ten years wed, he called her Sweetheart still)"
810,PLYMOUTH,"Forbore to raze the chapel to the ground,"
811,PLYMOUTH,"But stayed with flying buttress either side,"
812,PLYMOUTH,Repaired the roof and made it to her mind.
813,PLYMOUTH,"And there they lie, both in one marble tomb"
814,PLYMOUTH,On which their effigies with clasping hands
815,PLYMOUTH,Bear witness to an everlasting love.
816,PLYMOUTH,
817,PLYMOUTH,And when vacation brings its hours of rest
818,PLYMOUTH,I sometimes sit within the Saxon church
819,PLYMOUTH,And muse upon the changes time has brought
820,PLYMOUTH,"Save to the faith that reared the little shrine,"
821,PLYMOUTH,"And still builds churches ""in Fayre Jesu's name."""

936,PLYMOUTH,From the upland's stony pathways
937,PLYMOUTH,Where the snowline meets the outposts
938,PLYMOUTH,"Of the forest, sparse and lorn."
939,PLYMOUTH,
940,PLYMOUTH,"Nether tracts by sunlight heated,"
941,PLYMOUTH,"Show the vines in serried rows,"
942,PLYMOUTH,Basking through the drowsy summer
943,PLYMOUTH,Till their rich and generous vintage
944,PLYMOUTH,From the wine-press redly flows.
945,PLYMOUTH,
946,PLYMOUTH,"Land of mountain peaks stupendous,"
947,PLYMOUTH,Lakes that fade to meet the sky!
948,PLYMOUTH,"Land for gods, for dreaming poets,"
949,PLYMOUTH,"Fit for men of soaring greatness,"
950,PLYMOUTH,Sons of gifted ancestry.
951,PLYMOUTH,
952,PLYMOUTH,"Gods I found not, neither poets,"
953,PLYMOUTH,Only little men who toil
954,PLYMOUTH,"To supply the passing stranger,"
955,PLYMOUTH,"Bound upon the wheel of pleasure,"
956,PLYMOUTH,With the produce of the soil.
957,PLYMOUTH,
958,PLYMOUTH,What would Bonivard or Calvin
959,PLYMOUTH,"Think of you, my little men,"
960,PLYMOUTH,"With your minds on money turning,"
961,PLYMOUTH,While you strain with itching fingers
962,PLYMOUTH,Fast the golden calf to pen?
963,PLYMOUTH,
964,PLYMOUTH,Yet I love your honest peasants
965,PLYMOUTH,"Dwelling on the mountain slope,"
966,PLYMOUTH,"Slow and stolid, yet the children"
967,PLYMOUTH,"Of the spirit born of freedom,"
968,PLYMOUTH,Of the patience born of hope.
969,PLYMOUTH,
970,PLYMOUTH,"For among these humble toilers,"
971,PLYMOUTH,"From the grasping instinct free,"
972,PLYMOUTH,"Still we find the cheerful-hearted,"
973,PLYMOUTH,"Earnest, honest Switzer people"
974,PLYMOUTH,With the old simplicity.

979,PLYMOUTH,Burial at Sea
980,PLYMOUTH,
981,PLYMOUTH,'Twas midnight in the southern seas
982,PLYMOUTH,And windless.  On the placid deep
983,PLYMOUTH,"Flashed sparkling phosphorescences,"
984,PLYMOUTH,"While moonbeams, bright in silver bars,"
985,PLYMOUTH,Lay like a pathway to the stars.
986,PLYMOUTH,
987,PLYMOUTH,"Tireless, our engines, day and night,"
988,PLYMOUTH,A month had throbbed their endless round
989,PLYMOUTH,Without a pause to mark time's flight.
990,PLYMOUTH,We heard it all unconsciously
991,PLYMOUTH,Till suddenly it ceased to be.
992,PLYMOUTH,
993,PLYMOUTH,"For now the slowing pulse that beat,"
994,PLYMOUTH,Stopped in the vessel's iron breast
995,PLYMOUTH,And quickly changed my slumber sweet
996,PLYMOUTH,To wandering and uneasy thought
997,PLYMOUTH,Of what the midnight might have brought.
998,PLYMOUTH,
999,PLYMOUTH,"Gaining the deck, I looked around"
1000,PLYMOUTH,"With drowsy eyes and half asleep,"
1001,PLYMOUTH,And saw a something wrapped and bound
1002,PLYMOUTH,And weighted.  I was standing near
1003,PLYMOUTH,Some hapless seaman's simple bier.
1004,PLYMOUTH,
1005,PLYMOUTH,"A shapeless form in canvas lay,"
1006,PLYMOUTH,"Stretched on a wooden grating low,"
1007,PLYMOUTH,Waiting the word to pass away
1008,PLYMOUTH,Into the silent depths of sea
1009,PLYMOUTH,And boundless realm of fantasy.
1010,PLYMOUTH,
1011,PLYMOUTH,Before the bulwark's opening stood
1012,PLYMOUTH,A group about a lantern's light
1013,PLYMOUTH,"Moveless like figures carved in wood,"
1014,PLYMOUTH,"Whilst one with gruff solemnity,"
1015,PLYMOUTH,Read prayers for those who die at sea.
1016,PLYMOUTH,
1017,PLYMOUTH,"Then at the end, with sudden leap,"
1018,PLYMOUTH,"That sent the sparkling water high,"
1019,PLYMOUTH,The body plunged into the deep
1020,PLYMOUTH,Amid a million points of light
1021,PLYMOUTH,That glittered as it sank from sight.
1022,PLYMOUTH,
1023,PLYMOUTH,"Scarce had a moment passed, before"
1024,PLYMOUTH,The men with silent haste had gone:
1025,PLYMOUTH,"The engines plied their task, once more,"
1026,PLYMOUTH,The ship her steady course pursued
1027,PLYMOUTH,Across the moonlit solitude.
1028,PLYMOUTH,
1029,PLYMOUTH,"The morning dawned, the hours passed by"
1030,PLYMOUTH,And life on board from day to day
1031,PLYMOUTH,Was changeless as the sea and sky.
1032,PLYMOUTH,And so unreal the memory seemed
1033,PLYMOUTH,I wondered if I had not dreamed.

1036,PLYMOUTH,
1037,PLYMOUTH,
1038,PLYMOUTH,The Master of the Marionettes
1039,PLYMOUTH,
1040,PLYMOUTH,"'Twas at the fair of Epinetz,"
1041,PLYMOUTH,And all the country-side was there.
1042,PLYMOUTH,"Each booth gave out its blatant strains,"
1043,PLYMOUTH,"And grinning came the sheepish swains,"
1044,PLYMOUTH,Who greeted with approving stare
1045,PLYMOUTH,"The movements of the marionettes,"
1046,PLYMOUTH,While from his place well hid from sight
1047,PLYMOUTH,"The master laboured, faint and white."
1048,PLYMOUTH,
1049,PLYMOUTH,"A villain dark, with cloak and plume,"
1050,PLYMOUTH,"Through two acts of imbroglio,"
1051,PLYMOUTH,Pursued a maid of laughing mien
1052,PLYMOUTH,Who played a ribboned tambourine
1053,PLYMOUTH,"And loved a gay incognito,"
1054,PLYMOUTH,"By whom the villain met his doom,"
1055,PLYMOUTH,"While Pierrot, in a comic part,"
1056,PLYMOUTH,Danced to conceal a breaking heart.
1057,PLYMOUTH,
1058,PLYMOUTH,'Twas late.  The snow fell thick and still
1059,PLYMOUTH,The market place in silence lay.
1060,PLYMOUTH,"The master, tired and overwrought,"
1061,PLYMOUTH,For troupe and self a lodging sought.
1062,PLYMOUTH,The inn was full.  He went his way
1063,PLYMOUTH,Across the heath; beyond the hill
1064,PLYMOUTH,Dawn found him wrapped from head to feet
1065,PLYMOUTH,In winter's snowy winding-sheet.
1066,PLYMOUTH,
1067,PLYMOUTH,"And as he sank in deadly sleep,"
1068,PLYMOUTH,"His spirit, like a floating haze,"
1069,PLYMOUTH,"Wavered a moment o'er the snow,"
1070,PLYMOUTH,A valediction to bestow.
1071,PLYMOUTH,"And solemnly, with wistful gaze,"
1072,PLYMOUTH,"The puppets bowed in reverence deep,"
1073,PLYMOUTH,Speeding with farewells and regrets
1074,PLYMOUTH,The master of the Marionettes.

1081,PLYMOUTH,"Old as mankind, yet with immortal youth:"
1082,PLYMOUTH,"Unyielding, ardent, sinuous and bold,"
1083,PLYMOUTH,Alluring ever in the guise of truth.
1084,PLYMOUTH,
1085,PLYMOUTH,Where is the fire that warmed me yesterday?
1086,PLYMOUTH,And where the flame that will to-morrow blaze
1087,PLYMOUTH,To leave me shivering by its ashes gray?
1088,PLYMOUTH,
1089,PLYMOUTH,"The wind that sweetly sings in ocean caves,"
1090,PLYMOUTH,Then dallies with the wallflowers on the tower
1091,PLYMOUTH,May fan assassins and sweep over graves.
1092,PLYMOUTH,
1093,PLYMOUTH,What pleasure has a kiss that fever brings?
1094,PLYMOUTH,Or one grown cold with satisfied desire?
1095,PLYMOUTH,"The love that on the senses fiercely plays,"
1096,PLYMOUTH,Comes like a wind and passes like a fire.

1103,PLYMOUTH,What do men rate at the highest in life?
1104,PLYMOUTH,"Diamonds that glow,"
1105,PLYMOUTH,"The finest in water,"
1106,PLYMOUTH,In colour and form:
1107,PLYMOUTH,Such as an eastern king's favourite wife
1108,PLYMOUTH,"Wears strung in a row,"
1109,PLYMOUTH,"Or, as those that in slaughter,"
1110,PLYMOUTH,In sack or in storm
1111,PLYMOUTH,"Of a citadel's heights,"
1112,PLYMOUTH,Are torn from a Khalifah slain in the strife?
1113,PLYMOUTH,"No.  Diamonds decline when Love claims his own,"
1114,PLYMOUTH,And freely are bartered for kisses alone.
1115,PLYMOUTH,
1116,PLYMOUTH,"Some say that virtue is prized more than all,"
1117,PLYMOUTH,Virtue that scorns
1118,PLYMOUTH,The baseness and ill
1119,PLYMOUTH,The decalogue cites
1120,PLYMOUTH,And sternly forbids to great and to small.
1121,PLYMOUTH,But when on the horns
1122,PLYMOUTH,"Of dilemma, men kill"
1123,PLYMOUTH,"Compunction, whose lights"
1124,PLYMOUTH,"Die in darkness profound,"
1125,PLYMOUTH,"Where mortals are fated to stumble and fall,"
1126,PLYMOUTH,Renouncing for kisses the wisdom of time
1127,PLYMOUTH,To find in the sacrifice something sublime.
1128,PLYMOUTH,
1129,PLYMOUTH,"Rank, Riches and Fame have, each in their way,"
1130,PLYMOUTH,A hold on the mind
1131,PLYMOUTH,"That we think is supreme,"
1132,PLYMOUTH,And sweep man along
1133,PLYMOUTH,To sated ambition's omnipotent sway:
1134,PLYMOUTH,Till one day we find
1135,PLYMOUTH,"They are vain as a dream,"
1136,PLYMOUTH,Or a beautiful song
1137,PLYMOUTH,Evanescently grand:
1138,PLYMOUTH,And the value we see of the brave display
1139,PLYMOUTH,"Of Riches and Fame and Rank at their best,"
1140,PLYMOUTH,Is far below kisses when put to the test.

1146,PLYMOUTH,
1147,PLYMOUTH,A light mist creeps across the downs:
1148,PLYMOUTH,A gleam through clouds is faintly seen:
1149,PLYMOUTH,The grass is wet with heavy dew:
1150,PLYMOUTH,Sear are the leaves that once were green.
1151,PLYMOUTH,I walk at midday when the sun
1152,PLYMOUTH,Throws still some welcome warmth and light:
1153,PLYMOUTH,"A chill comes with the afternoon,"
1154,PLYMOUTH,And icy is the air at night.
1155,PLYMOUTH,Summer is dead.  Its shrouded form
1156,PLYMOUTH,"Lies on the logs that make its pyre,"
1157,PLYMOUTH,"And fancy sees its ghost ascend,"
1158,PLYMOUTH,A shadowy wraith above the fire.

1166,PLYMOUTH,Old memories come between the lights
1167,PLYMOUTH,To chasten with their whispers faint
1168,PLYMOUTH,The passing Christmas merriment.
1169,PLYMOUTH,"Yet through it all, one constant note"
1170,PLYMOUTH,"Chimes with the season's higher sense,"
1171,PLYMOUTH,"Love's influence unchanged remains,"

1182,PLYMOUTH,Of flower or weed:
1183,PLYMOUTH,Thrice happy he who leaves a rose.
1184,PLYMOUTH,
1185,PLYMOUTH,"What is a life in vainness spent,"
1186,PLYMOUTH,"That will not bear the common test,"
1187,PLYMOUTH,"When, laid to rest"
1188,PLYMOUTH,"In earth's cold breast,"
1189,PLYMOUTH,"We sleep at last, insentient?"
1190,PLYMOUTH,
1191,PLYMOUTH,"What is a gift bestowed on man,"
1192,PLYMOUTH,Unless he spreads abroad its light
1193,PLYMOUTH,And turns its might
1194,PLYMOUTH,To aid the right
1195,PLYMOUTH,And strives to do the best he can?
1196,PLYMOUTH,
1197,PLYMOUTH,What matters it if all your toil
1198,PLYMOUTH,Thankless for ever must remain?

1216,PLYMOUTH,"Shone on the pure in heart, the Saints' compeers,"
1217,PLYMOUTH,Who knew no more life's bitterness and fears
1218,PLYMOUTH,"But dwelt thenceforth upon a nobler height,"
1219,PLYMOUTH,Rapt in the radiance of Redemption's light
1220,PLYMOUTH,That still to the elect of God appears.
1221,PLYMOUTH,"Each Christmas sees, before thy ancient shrine,"
1222,PLYMOUTH,"Its sacred thorn burst into glorious flower,"
1223,PLYMOUTH,"Of Heaven's immortal life a constant sign,"

1235,PLYMOUTH,Forgotten with her pageants brief and vain
1236,PLYMOUTH,That flashed inconstant on the Arno's tide.
1237,PLYMOUTH,"But, toned to softened hues, her walls abide,"
1238,PLYMOUTH,"Enclosing baptistery, tower, and fane"
1239,PLYMOUTH,Wherein yet swings the lamp with brazen chain
1240,PLYMOUTH,That marked the pendulum's time-measured stride
1241,PLYMOUTH,"And though the centuries, in lengthening roll,"
1242,PLYMOUTH,Show ever fainter through perspective time
1243,PLYMOUTH,"The fame depicted in the mouldering scroll,"
1244,PLYMOUTH,They cannot dim the shining aureole

1255,PLYMOUTH,Where first the world to Shakespeare's childish gaze
1256,PLYMOUTH,Disclosed its wonders when his footsteps strayed;
1257,PLYMOUTH,"Where, fired with love, he roamed the forest glade,"
1258,PLYMOUTH,Storing clear memories for other days;
1259,PLYMOUTH,"And where, at last, acclaimed and crowned with bays,"
1260,PLYMOUTH,He dropped the lyre no other hand has played.
1261,PLYMOUTH,"Fame watches o'er the deathless poet's sleep,"
1262,PLYMOUTH,"Her fanfares echoing still their wild applause,"
1263,PLYMOUTH,"While sweet Melpomene and Thalia weep,"
1264,PLYMOUTH,"For theirs no more the grandest flight that soars,"

1274,PLYMOUTH,"Joy fills thy golden chalice to the brim,"
1275,PLYMOUTH,Fit symbol of the sacred seraphim
1276,PLYMOUTH,Who with their blazing phalanx headlong drove
1277,PLYMOUTH,"The Star of Morning from his seat above,"
1278,PLYMOUTH,"Scattering celestial sparks through voidness dim,"
1279,PLYMOUTH,To fall upon our planet's curving rim
1280,PLYMOUTH,And bloom as thy fair flowers in mead and grove.
1281,PLYMOUTH,"As victory's anthem stirred the heavenly choir,"

1296,PLYMOUTH,And litters borne by slaves of ebon hue
1297,PLYMOUTH,Breasted the throng that ever thicker grew
1298,PLYMOUTH,And onward hurried where the portal vast
1299,PLYMOUTH,"Showed praetor, tribune and plebeian massed"
1300,PLYMOUTH,With traders from afar beyond the blue.
1301,PLYMOUTH,"Road of the dead! thy voices haunted me,"
1302,PLYMOUTH,"Once as I lingered on a starlit night,"
1303,PLYMOUTH,Seeing thy restless ghosts in fantasy:
1304,PLYMOUTH,And Peter paused again in act to flee:
1305,PLYMOUTH,"With downcast eyes and pale with sudden fright,"
1306,PLYMOUTH,"Then whispered low: ""Quo vadis Domine?"""

1308,PLYMOUTH,

1321,PLYMOUTH,Broad fields of clover where marauding bees
1322,PLYMOUTH,"Lighten their toil with murmured harmonies,"
1323,PLYMOUTH,Whilst corn in rolling waves of verdant sheen
1324,PLYMOUTH,Lends rhythmic movement to the rural scene
1325,PLYMOUTH,And sighs responsive to the wind-stirred trees.
1326,PLYMOUTH,"The mingled voices, like a poet's rhyme,"
1327,PLYMOUTH,Link with their music pensiveness and joy:
1328,PLYMOUTH,Yet each has meaning in its wayward time:
