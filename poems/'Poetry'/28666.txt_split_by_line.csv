127,HYMEN,
128,HYMEN,"_As from a temple service, tall and dignified, with slow pace, each a"
129,HYMEN,"queen, the sixteen matrons from the temple of Hera pass before the"
130,HYMEN,curtain--a dark purple hung between Ionic columns--of the porch or open
131,HYMEN,hall of a palace. Their hair is bound as the marble hair of the temple
132,HYMEN,Hera. Each wears a crown or diadem of gold._
133,HYMEN,
134,HYMEN,"_They sing--the music is temple music, deep, simple, chanting notes:_"
135,HYMEN,
136,HYMEN,From the closed garden
137,HYMEN,Where our feet pace
138,HYMEN,"Back and forth each day,"
139,HYMEN,"This gladiolus white,"
140,HYMEN,"This red, this purple spray--"
141,HYMEN,Gladiolus tall with dignity
142,HYMEN,"As yours, lady--we lay"
143,HYMEN,Before your feet and pray:
144,HYMEN,
145,HYMEN,Of all the blessings--
146,HYMEN,"Youth, joy, ecstasy--"
147,HYMEN,May one gift last
148,HYMEN,(As the tall gladiolus may
149,HYMEN,"Outlast the wind-flower,"
150,HYMEN,"Winter-rose or rose),"
151,HYMEN,"One gift above,"
152,HYMEN,Encompassing all those;
153,HYMEN,
154,HYMEN,"For her, for him,"
155,HYMEN,"For all within these palace walls,"
156,HYMEN,"Beyond the feast,"
157,HYMEN,"Beyond the cry of Hymen and the torch,"
158,HYMEN,Beyond the night and music
159,HYMEN,Echoing through the porch till day.
160,HYMEN,
161,HYMEN,"_The music, with its deep chanting notes, dies away. The curtain hangs"
162,HYMEN,"motionless in rich, full folds. Then from this background of darkness,"
163,HYMEN,"dignity and solemn repose, a flute gradually detaches itself, becomes"
164,HYMEN,"clearer and clearer, pipes alone one shrill, simple little melody._"
165,HYMEN,
166,HYMEN,"_From the distance, four children's voices blend with the flute, and"
167,HYMEN,"four very little girls pass singly before the curtain, small maids or"
168,HYMEN,attendants of the sixteen matrons. Their hair is short and curls at the
169,HYMEN,back of their heads like the hair of the chryselephantine Hermes. They
170,HYMEN,sing:_
171,HYMEN,
172,HYMEN,Where the first crocus buds unfold
173,HYMEN,We found these petals near the cold
174,HYMEN,Swift river-bed.
175,HYMEN,
176,HYMEN,Beneath the rocks where ivy-frond
177,HYMEN,Puts forth new leaves to gleam beyond
178,HYMEN,Those lately dead:
179,HYMEN,
180,HYMEN,The very smallest two or three
181,HYMEN,Of gold (gold pale as ivory)
182,HYMEN,We gather√®d.
183,HYMEN,
184,HYMEN,"_When the little girls have passed before the curtain, a wood-wind"
185,HYMEN,weaves a richer note into the flute melody; then the two blend into one
186,HYMEN,"song. But as the wood-wind grows in mellowness and richness, the flute"
187,HYMEN,gradually dies away into a secondary theme and the wood-wind alone
188,HYMEN,evolves the melody of a new song._
189,HYMEN,
190,HYMEN,"_Two by two--like two sets of medallions with twin profiles distinct,"
191,HYMEN,"one head slightly higher, bent forward a little--the four figures of"
192,HYMEN,"four slight, rather fragile taller children, are outlined with sharp"
193,HYMEN,white contour against the curtain._
194,HYMEN,
195,HYMEN,"_The hair is smooth against the heads, falling to the shoulders but"
196,HYMEN,"slightly waved against the nape of the neck. They are looking down, each"
197,HYMEN,at a spray of winter-rose. The tunics fall to the knees in sharp marble
198,HYMEN,folds. They sing:_
199,HYMEN,
200,HYMEN,Never more will the wind
201,HYMEN,"Cherish you again,"
202,HYMEN,Never more will the rain.
203,HYMEN,
204,HYMEN,Never more
205,HYMEN,Shall we find you bright
206,HYMEN,In the snow and wind.
207,HYMEN,
208,HYMEN,"The snow is melted,"
209,HYMEN,"The snow is gone,"
210,HYMEN,And you are flown:
211,HYMEN,
212,HYMEN,"Like a bird out of our hand,"
213,HYMEN,"Like a light out of our heart,"
214,HYMEN,You are gone.
215,HYMEN,
216,HYMEN,"_As the wistful notes of the wood-wind gradually die away, there comes a"
217,HYMEN,"sudden, shrill, swift piping._"
218,HYMEN,
219,HYMEN,"_Free and wild, like the wood-maidens of Artemis, is this last group of"
220,HYMEN,"four--very straight with heads tossed back. They sing in rich, free,"
221,HYMEN,swift notes. They move swiftly before the curtain in contrast to the
222,HYMEN,"slow, important pace of the first two groups. Their hair is loose and"
223,HYMEN,rayed out like that of the sun-god. They are boyish in shape and
224,HYMEN,"gesture. They carry hyacinths in baskets, strapped like quivers to their"
225,HYMEN,"backs. They reach to draw the flower sprays from the baskets, as the"
226,HYMEN,Huntress her arrows._
227,HYMEN,
228,HYMEN,"_As they dart swiftly to and fro before the curtain, they are youth,"
229,HYMEN,"they are spring--they are the Chelidonia, their song is the swallow-song"
230,HYMEN,of joy:_
231,HYMEN,
232,HYMEN,Between the hollows
233,HYMEN,Of the little hills
234,HYMEN,The spring spills blue--
235,HYMEN,"Turquoise, sapphire, lapis-lazuli"
236,HYMEN,On a brown cloth outspread.
237,HYMEN,
238,HYMEN,"Ah see,"
239,HYMEN,"How carefully we lay them now,"
240,HYMEN,"Each hyacinth spray,"
241,HYMEN,Across the marble floor--
242,HYMEN,A pattern your bent eyes
243,HYMEN,May trace and follow
244,HYMEN,To the shut bridal door.
245,HYMEN,
246,HYMEN,"Lady, our love, our dear,"
247,HYMEN,"Our bride most fair,"
248,HYMEN,They grew among the hollows
249,HYMEN,Of the hills;
250,HYMEN,"As if the sea had spilled its blue,"
251,HYMEN,As if the sea had risen
252,HYMEN,"From its bed,"
253,HYMEN,"And sinking to the level of the shore,"
254,HYMEN,Left hyacinths on the floor.
255,HYMEN,
256,HYMEN,"_There is a pause. Flute, pipe and wood-wind blend in a full, rich"
257,HYMEN,"movement. There is no definite melody but full, powerful rhythm like"
258,HYMEN,"soft but steady wind above forest trees. Into this, like rain, gradually"
259,HYMEN,creeps the note of strings._
260,HYMEN,
261,HYMEN,"_As the strings grow stronger and finally dominate the whole, the"
262,HYMEN,bride-chorus passes before the curtain. There may be any number in this
263,HYMEN,"chorus. The figures--tall young women, clothed in long white"
264,HYMEN,"tunics--follow one another closely, yet are all distinct like a"
265,HYMEN,procession of a temple frieze._
266,HYMEN,
267,HYMEN,_The bride in the center is not at first distinguishable from her
268,HYMEN,"maidens; but as they begin their song, the maidens draw apart into two"
269,HYMEN,"groups, leaving the veiled symbolic figure standing alone in the"
270,HYMEN,center._
271,HYMEN,
272,HYMEN,_The two groups range themselves to right and left like officiating
273,HYMEN,"priestesses. The veiled figure stands with her back against the curtain,"
274,HYMEN,the others being in profile. Her head is swathed in folds of diaphanous
275,HYMEN,"white, through which the features are visible, like the veiled Tanagra._"
276,HYMEN,
277,HYMEN,"_When the song is finished, the group to the bride's left turns about;"
278,HYMEN,"also the bride, so that all face in one direction. In processional form"
279,HYMEN,"they pass out, the figure of the bride again merging, not"
280,HYMEN,distinguishable from the maidens._
281,HYMEN,
282,HYMEN,_Strophe_
283,HYMEN,
284,HYMEN,But of her
285,HYMEN,Who can say if she is fair?
286,HYMEN,"Bound with fillet,"
287,HYMEN,Bound with myrtle
288,HYMEN,"Underneath her flowing veil,"
289,HYMEN,Only the soft length
290,HYMEN,(Beneath her dress)
291,HYMEN,Of saffron shoe is bright
292,HYMEN,As a great lily-heart
293,HYMEN,In its white loveliness.
294,HYMEN,
295,HYMEN,_Antistrophe_
296,HYMEN,
297,HYMEN,But of her
298,HYMEN,We can say that she is fair.
299,HYMEN,"We bleached the fillet,"
300,HYMEN,Brought the myrtle;
301,HYMEN,To us the task was set
302,HYMEN,Of knotting the fine threads of silk:
303,HYMEN,"We fastened the veil,"
304,HYMEN,And over the white foot
305,HYMEN,Drew on the painted shoe
306,HYMEN,Steeped in Illyrian crocus.
307,HYMEN,
308,HYMEN,_Strophe_
309,HYMEN,
310,HYMEN,"But of her,"
311,HYMEN,Who can say if she is fair?
312,HYMEN,For her head is covered over
313,HYMEN,With her mantle
314,HYMEN,"White on white,"
315,HYMEN,"Snow on whiter amaranth,"
316,HYMEN,"Snow on hoar-frost,"
317,HYMEN,"Snow on snow,"
318,HYMEN,Snow on whitest buds of myrrh.
319,HYMEN,
320,HYMEN,_Antistrophe_
321,HYMEN,
322,HYMEN,"But of her,"
323,HYMEN,We can say that she is fair;
324,HYMEN,For we know underneath
325,HYMEN,"All the wanness,"
326,HYMEN,All the heat
327,HYMEN,(In her blanched face)
328,HYMEN,Of desire
329,HYMEN,Is caught in her eyes as fire
330,HYMEN,In the dark center leaf
331,HYMEN,Of the white Syrian iris.
332,HYMEN,
333,HYMEN,"_The rather hard, hieratic precision of the music--its stately pause and"
334,HYMEN,beat--is broken now into irregular lilt and rhythm of strings._
335,HYMEN,
336,HYMEN,"_Four tall young women, very young matrons, enter in a group. They stand"
337,HYMEN,"clear and fair, but this little group entirely lacks the austere"
338,HYMEN,precision of the procession of maidens just preceding them. They pause
339,HYMEN,"in the center of the stage; turn, one three-quarter, two in profile and"
340,HYMEN,"the fourth full face; they stand, turned as if confiding in each other"
341,HYMEN,like a Tanagra group._
342,HYMEN,
343,HYMEN,"_They sing lightly, their flower trays under their arms._"
344,HYMEN,
345,HYMEN,Along the yellow sand
346,HYMEN,Above the rocks
347,HYMEN,The laurel-bushes stand.
348,HYMEN,Against the shimmering heat
349,HYMEN,Each separate leaf
350,HYMEN,"Is bright and cold,"
351,HYMEN,And through the bronze
352,HYMEN,Of shining bark and wood
353,HYMEN,Run the fine threads of gold.
354,HYMEN,
355,HYMEN,"Here in our wicker-trays,"
356,HYMEN,We bring the first faint blossoming
357,HYMEN,Of fragrant bays:
358,HYMEN,
359,HYMEN,"Lady, their blushes shine"
360,HYMEN,As faint in hue
361,HYMEN,As when through petals
362,HYMEN,Of a laurel-rose
363,HYMEN,"The sun shines through,"
364,HYMEN,And throws a purple shadow
365,HYMEN,On a marble vase.
366,HYMEN,
367,HYMEN,"(Ah, love,"
368,HYMEN,So her fair breasts will shine
369,HYMEN,With the faint shadow above.)
370,HYMEN,
371,HYMEN,_The harp chords become again more regular in simple definite rhythm.
372,HYMEN,"The music is not so intense as the bride-chorus; and quieter, more"
373,HYMEN,"sedate, than the notes preceding the entrance of the last group._"
374,HYMEN,
375,HYMEN,_Five or six slightly older serene young women enter in processional
376,HYMEN,"form; each holding before her, with precise bending of arms, coverlets"
377,HYMEN,"and linen, carefully folded, as if for the bride couch. The garments are"
378,HYMEN,"purple, scarlet and deep blue, with edge of gold._"
379,HYMEN,
380,HYMEN,_They sing to blending of wood-wind and harp._
381,HYMEN,
382,HYMEN,"From citron-bower be her bed,"
383,HYMEN,"Cut from branch of tree a-flower,"
384,HYMEN,Fashioned for her maidenhead.
385,HYMEN,
386,HYMEN,"From Lydian apples, sweet of hue,"
387,HYMEN,Cut the width of board and lathe.
388,HYMEN,Carve the feet from myrtle-wood.
389,HYMEN,
390,HYMEN,Let the palings of her bed
391,HYMEN,Be quince and box-wood overlaid
392,HYMEN,With the scented bark of yew.
393,HYMEN,
394,HYMEN,"That all the wood in blossoming,"
395,HYMEN,May calm her heart and cool her blood
396,HYMEN,For losing of her maidenhood.
397,HYMEN,
398,HYMEN,_The wood-winds become more rich and resonant. A tall youth crosses the
399,HYMEN,"stage as if seeking the bride door. The music becomes very rich, full of"
400,HYMEN,color._
401,HYMEN,
402,HYMEN,"_The figure itself is a flame, an exaggerated symbol; the hair a flame;"
403,HYMEN,"the wings, deep red or purple, stand out against the curtains in a"
404,HYMEN,"contrasting or almost clashing shade of purple. The tunic, again a rich"
405,HYMEN,"purple or crimson, falls almost to the knees. The knees are bare; the"
406,HYMEN,sandals elaborately strapped over and over. The curtain seems a rich
407,HYMEN,"purple cloud, the figure, still brighter, like a flamboyant bird, half"
408,HYMEN,emerged in the sunset._
409,HYMEN,
410,HYMEN,"_Love pauses just outside the bride's door with his gift, a tuft of"
411,HYMEN,"black-purple cyclamen. He sings to the accompaniment of wood-winds, in a"
412,HYMEN,"rich, resonant voice:_"
413,HYMEN,
414,HYMEN,The crimson cover of her bed
415,HYMEN,"Is not so rich, nor so deeply bled"
416,HYMEN,"The purple-fish that dyed it red,"
417,HYMEN,As when in a hot sheltered glen
418,HYMEN,There flowered these stalks of cyclamen:
419,HYMEN,
420,HYMEN,(Purple with honey-points
421,HYMEN,Of horns for petals;
422,HYMEN,"Sweet and dark and crisp,"
423,HYMEN,As fragrant as her maiden kiss.)
424,HYMEN,
425,HYMEN,There with his honey-seeking lips
426,HYMEN,"The bee clings close and warmly sips,"
427,HYMEN,And seeks with honey-thighs to sway
428,HYMEN,And drink the very flower away.
429,HYMEN,
430,HYMEN,"(Ah, stern the petals drawing back;"
431,HYMEN,"Ah rare, ah virginal her breath!)"
432,HYMEN,
433,HYMEN,"Crimson, with honey-seeking lips,"
434,HYMEN,"The sun lies hot across his back,"
435,HYMEN,The gold is decked across his wings.
436,HYMEN,Quivering he sways and quivering clings
437,HYMEN,"(Ah, rare her shoulders drawing back!)"
438,HYMEN,"One moment, then the plunderer slips"
439,HYMEN,Between the purple flower-lips.
440,HYMEN,
441,HYMEN,_Love passes out with a crash of cymbals. There is a momentary pause and
442,HYMEN,"the music falls into its calm, wave-like rhythm._"
443,HYMEN,
444,HYMEN,"_A band of boys passes before the curtain. They pass from side to side,"
445,HYMEN,"crossing and re-crossing; but their figures never confuse one another,"
446,HYMEN,the outlines are never blurred. They stand out against the curtain with
447,HYMEN,"symbolic gesture, stooping as if to gather up the wreaths, or swaying"
448,HYMEN,with long stiff branch as if to sweep the fallen petals from the
449,HYMEN,floor._
450,HYMEN,
451,HYMEN,"_There is no marked melody from the instruments, but the boys' voices,"
452,HYMEN,"humming lightly as they enter, gradually evolve a little dance song."
453,HYMEN,There are no words but the lilt up and down of the boys' tenor voices._
454,HYMEN,
455,HYMEN,"_Then, as if they had finished the task of gathering up the wreaths and"
456,HYMEN,"sweeping the petals, they stand in groups of two before the pillars"
457,HYMEN,where the torches have been placed. They lift the torches from the
458,HYMEN,"brackets. They hold them aloft between them, one torch to each two boys."
459,HYMEN,"Their figures are cut against the curtain like the simple, triangular"
460,HYMEN,"design on the base of a vase or frieze--the boys' heads on a level, the"
461,HYMEN,torches above them._
462,HYMEN,
463,HYMEN,"_They sing in clear, half-subdued voices._"
464,HYMEN,
465,HYMEN,"Where love is king,"
466,HYMEN,"Ah, there is little need"
467,HYMEN,"To dance and sing,"
468,HYMEN,With bridal-torch to flare
469,HYMEN,Amber and scatter light
470,HYMEN,"Across the purple air,"
471,HYMEN,To sing and dance
472,HYMEN,To flute-note and to reed.
473,HYMEN,
474,HYMEN,Where love is come
475,HYMEN,"(Ah, love is come indeed!)"
476,HYMEN,Our limbs are numb
477,HYMEN,Before his fiery need;
478,HYMEN,With all their glad
479,HYMEN,"Rapture of speech unsaid,"
480,HYMEN,Before his fiery lips
481,HYMEN,Our lips are mute and dumb.
482,HYMEN,
483,HYMEN,"Ah, sound of reed,"
484,HYMEN,"Ah, flute and trumpet wail,"
485,HYMEN,"Ah, joy decreed--"
486,HYMEN,The fringes of her veil
487,HYMEN,Are seared and white;

489,HYMEN,Blinded the torches fail.
490,HYMEN,"(Ah, love is come indeed!)"
491,HYMEN,
492,HYMEN,"_At the end of the song, the torches flicker out and the figures are no"
