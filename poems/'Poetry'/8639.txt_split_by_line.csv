61,,The First Book
62,,
63,,
64,,Orleans was hush’d in sleep. Stretch’d on her couch
65,,The delegated Maiden lay: with toil
66,,"Exhausted and sore anguish, soon she closed"
67,,"Her heavy eye-lids; not reposing then,"
68,,"For busy Phantasy, in other scenes"
69,,"Awakened. Whether that superior powers,"
70,,"By wise permission, prompt the midnight dream,"
71,,Instructing so the passive faculty;[1]
72,,"Or that the soul, escaped its fleshly clog,"
73,,"Flies free, and soars amid the invisible world,"
74,,And all things _are_ that _seem_.[2]
75,,"Along a moor,"
76,,"Barren, and wide, and drear, and desolate,"
77,,She roam’d a wanderer thro’ the cheerless night.
78,,Far thro’ the silence of the unbroken plain
79,,"The bittern’s boom was heard, hoarse, heavy, deep,"
80,,It made most fitting music to the scene.
81,,"Black clouds, driven fast before the stormy wind,"
82,,Swept shadowing; thro’ their broken folds the moon
83,,"Struggled sometimes with transitory ray,"
84,,And made the moving darkness visible.
85,,And now arrived beside a fenny lake
86,,"She stands: amid its stagnate waters, hoarse"
87,,The long sedge rustled to the gales of night.
88,,"An age-worn bark receives the Maid, impell’d"
89,,By powers unseen; then did the moon display
90,,Where thro’ the crazy vessel’s yawning side
91,,"The muddy wave oozed in: a female guides,"
92,,"And spreads the sail before the wind, that moan’d"
93,,"As melancholy mournful to her ear,"
94,,As ever by the dungeon’d wretch was heard
95,,Howling at evening round the embattled towers
96,,"Of that hell-house[3] of France, ere yet sublime"
97,,The almighty people from their tyrant’s hand
98,,Dash’d down the iron rod.
99,,Intent the Maid
100,,"Gazed on the pilot’s form, and as she gazed"
101,,"Shiver’d, for wan her face was, and her eyes"
102,,"Hollow, and her sunk cheeks were furrowed deep,"
103,,Channell’d by tears; a few grey locks hung down
104,,Beneath her hood: then thro’ the Maiden’s veins
105,,"Chill crept the blood, for, as the night-breeze pass’d,"
106,,"Lifting her tattcr’d mantle, coil’d around"
107,,She saw a serpent gnawing at her heart.
108,,"The plumeless bat with short shrill note flits by,"
109,,"And the night-raven’s scream came fitfully,"
110,,Borne on the hollow blast. Eager the Maid
111,,"Look’d to the shore, and now upon the bank"
112,,"Leaps, joyful to escape, yet trembling still"
113,,In recollection.
114,,"There, a mouldering pile"
115,,"Stretch’d its wide ruins, o’er the plain below"
116,,"Casting a gloomy shade, save where the moon"
117,,"Shone thro’ its fretted windows: the dark Yew,"
118,,"Withering with age, branched there its naked roots,"
119,,And there the melancholy Cypress rear’d
120,,"Its head; the earth was heav’d with many a mound,"
121,,And here and there a half-demolish’d tomb.
122,,"And now, amid the ruin’s darkest shade,"
123,,The Virgin’s eye beheld where pale blue flames
124,,"Rose wavering, now just gleaming from the earth,"
125,,And now in darkness drown’d. An aged man
126,,"Sat near, seated on what in long-past days"
127,,"Had been some sculptur’d monument, now fallen"
128,,"And half-obscured by moss, and gathered heaps"
129,,Of withered yew-leaves and earth-mouldering bones;
130,,And shining in the ray was seen the track
131,,"Of slimy snail obscene. Composed his look,"
132,,"His eye was large and rayless, and fix’d full"
133,,Upon the Maid; the blue flames on his face
134,,Stream’d a pale light; his face was of the hue
135,,Of death; his limbs were mantled in a shroud.
136,,"Then with a deep heart-terrifying voice,"
137,,"Exclaim’d the Spectre, “Welcome to these realms,"
138,,These regions of Despair! O thou whose steps
139,,By Grief conducted to these sad abodes
140,,"Have pierced; welcome, welcome to this gloom"
141,,"Eternal, to this everlasting night,"
142,,"Where never morning darts the enlivening ray,"
143,,"Where never shines the sun, but all is dark,"
144,,Dark as the bosom of their gloomy King.”
145,,"So saying he arose, and by the hand"
146,,The Virgin seized with such a death-cold touch
147,,"As froze her very heart; and drawing on,"
148,,"Her, to the abbey’s inner ruin, led"
149,,Resistless. Thro’ the broken roof the moon
150,,Glimmer’d a scatter’d ray; the ivy twined
151,,Round the dismantled column; imaged forms
152,,"Of Saints and warlike Chiefs, moss-canker’d now"
153,,"And mutilate, lay strewn upon the ground,"
154,,"With crumbled fragments, crucifixes fallen,"
155,,And rusted trophies; and amid the heap
156,,Some monument’s defaced legend spake
157,,All human glory vain.
158,,
159,,The loud blast roar’d
160,,Amid the pile; and from the tower the owl
161,,Scream’d as the tempest shook her secret nest.
162,,"He, silent, led her on, and often paus’d,"
163,,"And pointed, that her eye might contemplate"
164,,At leisure the drear scene.
165,,He dragged her on
166,,"Thro’ a low iron door, down broken stairs;"
167,,Then a cold horror thro’ the Maiden’s frame
168,,"Crept, for she stood amid a vault, and saw,"
169,,"By the sepulchral lamp’s dim glaring light,"
170,,The fragments of the dead.
171,,"“Look here!” he cried,"
172,,"“Damsel, look here! survey this house of Death;"
173,,O soon to tenant it! soon to increase
174,,These trophies of mortality! for hence
175,,"Is no return. Gaze here! behold this skull,"
176,,"These eyeless sockets, and these unflesh’d jaws,"
177,,"That with their ghastly grinning, seem to mock"
178,,Thy perishable charms; for thus thy cheek
179,,"Must moulder. Child of Grief! shrinks not thy soul,"
180,,Viewing these horrors? trembles not thy heart
181,,"At the dread thought, that here its life’s-blood soon"
182,,"Now warm in life and feeling, mingle soon"
183,,With the cold clod? a thought most horrible!
184,,"So only dreadful, for reality"
185,,Is none of suffering here; here all is peace;
186,,No nerve will throb to anguish in the grave.
187,,Dreadful it is to think of losing life;
188,,"But having lost, knowledge of loss is not,"
189,,"Therefore no ill. Haste, Maiden, to repose;"
190,,Probe deep the seat of life.”
191,,So spake Despair
192,,"The vaulted roof echoed his hollow voice,"
193,,And all again was silence. Quick her heart
194,,"Panted. He drew a dagger from his breast,"
195,,"And cried again, “Haste Damsel to repose!"
196,,"One blow, and rest for ever!” On the Fiend"
197,,"Dark scowl’d the Virgin with indignant eye,"
198,,And dash’d the dagger down. He next his heart
199,,"Replaced the murderous steel, and drew the Maid"
200,,Along the downward vault.
201,,The damp earth gave
202,,A dim sound as they pass’d: the tainted air
203,,"Was cold, and heavy with unwholesome dews."
204,,"“Behold!” the fiend exclaim’d, “how gradual here"
205,,The fleshly burden of mortality
206,,Moulders to clay!” then fixing his broad eye
207,,"Full on her face, he pointed where a corpse"
208,,"Lay livid; she beheld with loathing look,"
209,,The spectacle abhorr’d by living man.
210,,
211,,"“Look here!” Despair pursued, “this loathsome mass"
212,,"Was once as lovely, and as full of life"
213,,"As, Damsel! thou art now. Those deep-sunk eyes"
214,,"Once beam’d the mild light of intelligence,"
215,,"And where thou seest the pamper’d flesh-worm trail,"
216,,Once the white bosom heaved. She fondly thought
217,,"That at the hallowed altar, soon the Priest"
218,,"Should bless her coming union, and the torch"
219,,"Its joyful lustre o’er the hall of joy,"
220,,Cast on her nuptial evening: earth to earth
221,,"That Priest consign’d her, and the funeral lamp"
222,,Glares on her cold face; for her lover went
223,,"By glory lur’d to war, and perish’d there;"
224,,Nor she endur’d to live. Ha! fades thy cheek?
225,,"Dost thou then, Maiden, tremble at the tale?"
226,,Look here! behold the youthful paramour!
227,,The self-devoted hero!”
228,,Fearfully
229,,"The Maid look’d down, and saw the well known face"
230,,"Of Theodore! in thoughts unspeakable,"
231,,"Convulsed with horror, o’er her face she clasp’d"
232,,"Her cold damp hands: “Shrink not,” the Phantom cried,"
233,,“Gaze on! for ever gaze!” more firm he grasp’d
234,,"Her quivering arm: “this lifeless mouldering clay,"
235,,"As well thou know’st, was warm with all the glow"
236,,Of Youth and Love; this is the arm that cleaved
237,,"Salisbury’s proud crest, now motionless in death,"
238,,Unable to protect the ravaged frame
239,,From the foul Offspring of Mortality
240,,"That feed on heroes. Tho’ long years were thine,"
241,,Yet never more would life reanimate
242,,This murdered man; murdered by thee! for thou
243,,"Didst lead him to the battle from his home,"
244,,Else living there in peace to good old age:
245,,In thy defence he died: strike deep! destroy
246,,Remorse with Life.”
247,,"The Maid stood motionless,"
248,,"And, wistless what she did, with trembling hand"
249,,"Received the dagger. Starting then, she cried,"
250,,“Avaunt Despair! Eternal Wisdom deals
251,,"Or peace to man, or misery, for his good"
252,,"Alike design’d; and shall the Creature cry,"
253,,Why hast thou done this? and with impious pride
254,,Destroy the life God gave?”
255,,"The Fiend rejoin’d,"
256,,“And thou dost deem it impious to destroy
257,,"The life God gave? What, Maiden, is the lot"
258,,"Assigned to mortal man? born but to drag,"
259,,"Thro’ life’s long pilgrimage, the wearying load"
260,,Of being; care corroded at the heart;
261,,Assail’d by all the numerous train of ills
262,,"That flesh inherits; till at length worn out,"
263,,This is his consummation!—think again!
264,,"What, Maiden, canst thou hope from lengthen’d life"
265,,"But lengthen’d sorrow? If protracted long,"
266,,Till on the bed of death thy feeble limbs
267,,"Outstretch their languid length, oh think what thoughts,"
268,,"What agonizing woes, in that dread hour,"
269,,"Assail the sinking heart! slow beats the pulse,"
270,,"Dim grows the eye, and clammy drops bedew"
271,,"The shuddering frame; then in its mightiest force,"
272,,"Mightiest in impotence, the love of life"
273,,"Seizes the throbbing heart, the faltering lips"
274,,"Pour out the impious prayer, that fain would change"
275,,"The unchangeable’s decree, surrounding friends"
276,,"Sob round the sufferer, wet his cheek with tears,"
277,,And all he loved in life embitters death!
278,,
279,,"Such, Maiden, are the pangs that wait the hour"
280,,Of calmest dissolution! yet weak man
281,,"Dares, in his timid piety, to live;"
282,,"And veiling Fear in Superstition’s garb,"
283,,He calls her Resignation!
284,,Coward wretch!
285,,Fond Coward! thus to make his Reason war
286,,"Against his Reason! Insect as he is,"
287,,"This sport of Chance, this being of a day,"
288,,"Whose whole existence the next cloud may blast,"
289,,"Believes himself the care of heavenly powers,"
290,,"That God regards Man, miserable Man,"
291,,"And preaching thus of Power and Providence,"
292,,Will crush the reptile that may cross his path!
293,,
294,,Fool that thou art! the Being that permits
295,,"Existence, _gives_ to man the worthless boon:"
296,,"A goodly gift to those who, fortune-blest,"
297,,"Bask in the sunshine of Prosperity,"
298,,And such do well to keep it. But to one
299,,"Sick at the heart with misery, and sore"
300,,"With many a hard unmerited affliction,"
301,,It is a hair that chains to wretchedness
302,,The slave who dares not burst it!
303,,"Thinkest thou,"
304,,"The parent, if his child should unrecall’d"
305,,"Return and fall upon his neck, and cry,"
306,,"Oh! the wide world is comfortless, and full"
307,,"Of vacant joys and heart-consuming cares,"
308,,I can be only happy in my home
309,,"With thee—my friend!—my father! Thinkest thou,"
310,,That he would thrust him as an outcast forth?
311,,"Oh I he would clasp the truant to his heart,"
312,,And love the trespass.”
313,,"Whilst he spake, his eye"
314,,"Dwelt on the Maiden’s cheek, and read her soul"
315,,"Struggling within. In trembling doubt she stood,"
316,,"Even as the wretch, whose famish’d entrails crave"
317,,"Supply, before him sees the poison’d food"
318,,In greedy horror.
319,,Yet not long the Maid
320,,"Debated, “Cease thy dangerous sophistry,"
321,,Eloquent tempter!” cried she. “Gloomy one!
322,,"What tho’ affliction be my portion here,"
323,,Think’st thou I do not feel high thoughts of joy.
324,,"Of heart-ennobling joy, when I look back"
325,,"Upon a life of duty well perform’d,"
326,,"Then lift mine eyes to Heaven, and there in faith"
327,,"Know my reward? I grant, were this life all,"
328,,"Was there no morning to the tomb’s long night,"
329,,"If man did mingle with the senseless clod,"
330,,"Himself as senseless, then wert thou indeed"
331,,"A wise and friendly comforter! But, Fiend!"
332,,"There is a morning to the tomb’s long night,"
333,,"A dawn of glory, a reward in Heaven,"
334,,He shall not gain who never merited.
335,,If thou didst know the worth of one good deed
336,,"In life’s last hour, thou would’st not bid me lose"
337,,The power to benefit; if I but save
338,,"A drowning fly, I shall not live in vain."
339,,"I have great duties, Fiend! me France expects,"
340,,Her heaven-doom’d Champion.”
341,,"“Maiden, thou hast done"
342,,"Thy mission here,” the unbaffled Fiend replied:"
343,,"“The foes are fled from Orleans: thou, perchance"
344,,"Exulting in the pride of victory,"
345,,Forgettest him who perish’d! yet albeit
346,,Thy harden’d heart forget the gallant youth;
347,,"That hour allotted canst thou not escape,"
348,,"That dreadful hour, when Contumely and Shame"
349,,Shall sojourn in thy dungeon. Wretched Maid!
350,,"Destined to drain the cup of bitterness,"
351,,Even to its dregs! England’s inhuman Chiefs
352,,"Shall scoff thy sorrows, black thy spotless fame,"
353,,"Wit-wanton it with lewd barbarity,"
354,,And force such burning blushes to the cheek
355,,"Of Virgin modesty, that thou shalt wish"
356,,"The earth might cover thee! in that last hour,"
357,,When thy bruis’d breast shall heave beneath the chains
358,,"That link thee to the stake; when o’er thy form,"
359,,"Exposed unmantled, the brute multitude"
360,,"Shall gaze, and thou shalt hear the ribald taunt,"
361,,More painful than the circling flames that scorch
362,,Each quivering member; wilt thou not in vain
363,,Then wish my friendly aid? then wish thine ear
364,,Had drank my words of comfort? that thy hand
365,,"Had grasp’d the dagger, and in death preserved"
366,,Insulted modesty?”
367,,Her glowing cheek
368,,Blush’d crimson; her wide eye on vacancy
369,,"Was fix’d; her breath short panted. The cold Fiend,"
370,,"Grasping her hand, exclaim’d, “too-timid Maid,"
371,,So long repugnant to the healing aid
372,,"My friendship proffers, now shalt thou behold"
373,,The allotted length of life.”
374,,"He stamp’d the earth,"
375,,"And dragging a huge coffin as his car,"
376,,"Two Gouls came on, of form more fearful-foul"
377,,Than ever palsied in her wildest dream
378,,Hag-ridden Superstition. Then Despair
379,,Seiz’d on the Maid whose curdling blood stood still.
380,,And placed her in the seat; and on they pass’d
381,,Adown the deep descent. A meteor light
382,,"Shot from the Daemons, as they dragg’d along"
383,,"The unwelcome load, and mark’d their brethren glut"
384,,On carcasses.
385,,Below the vault dilates
386,,Its ample bulk. “Look here!”—Despair addrest
387,,"The shuddering Virgin, “see the dome of Death!”"
388,,"It was a spacious cavern, hewn amid"
389,,"The entrails of the earth, as tho’ to form"
390,,"The grave of all mankind: no eye could reach,"
391,,"Tho’ gifted with the Eagle’s ample ken,"
392,,"Its distant bounds. There, thron’d in darkness, dwelt"
393,,The unseen Power of Death.
394,,"Here stopt the Gouls,"
395,,"Reaching the destin’d spot. The Fiend leapt out,"
396,,"And from the coffin, as he led the Maid,"
397,,"Exclaim’d, “Where never yet stood mortal man,"
398,,Thou standest: look around this boundless vault;
399,,"Observe the dole that Nature deals to man,"
400,,And learn to know thy friend.”
401,,"She not replied,"
402,,Observing where the Fates their several tasks
403,,Plied ceaseless. “Mark how short the longest web
404,,"Allowed to man! he cried; observe how soon,"
405,,"Twin’d round yon never-resting wheel, they change"
406,,"Their snowy hue, darkening thro’ many a shade,"
407,,Till Atropos relentless shuts the sheers!”
408,,
409,,"Too true he spake, for of the countless threads,"
410,,"Drawn from the heap, as white as unsunn’d snow,"
411,,"Or as the lovely lilly of the vale,"
412,,Was never one beyond the little span
413,,Of infancy untainted: few there were
414,,"But lightly tinged; more of deep crimson hue,"
415,,"Or deeper sable died.[4] Two Genii stood,"
416,,"Still as the web of Being was drawn forth,"
417,,"Sprinkling their powerful drops. From ebon urn,"
418,,The one unsparing dash’d the bitter wave
419,,"Of woe; and as he dash’d, his dark-brown brow"
420,,Relax’d to a hard smile. The milder form
421,,Shed less profusely there his lesser store;
422,,"Sometimes with tears increasing the scant boon,"
423,,Mourning the lot of man; and happy he
424,,Who on his thread those precious drops receives;
425,,If it be happiness to have the pulse
426,,"Throb fast with pity, and in such a world"
427,,"Of wretchedness, the generous heart that aches"
428,,With anguish at the sight of human woe.
429,,
430,,"To her the Fiend, well hoping now success,"
431,,"“This is thy thread! observe how short the span,"
432,,And see how copious yonder Genius pours
433,,The bitter stream of woe.” The Maiden saw
434,,"Fearless. “Now gaze!” the tempter Fiend exclaim’d,"
435,,"And placed again the poniard in her hand,"
436,,"For Superstition, with sulphureal torch"
437,,"Stalk’d to the loom. “This, Damsel, is thy fate!"
438,,The hour draws on—now drench the dagger deep!
439,,Now rush to happier worlds!”
440,,"The Maid replied,"
441,,"“Or to prevent or change the will of Heaven,"
442,,Impious I strive not: be that will perform’d!”
443,,
444,,
445,,"[1] May says of Serapis,"
446,,"“Erudit at placide humanam per somnia mentem,"
447,,Nocturnâque quiete docet; nulloque labore
448,,"Hic tantum parta est pretiosa scientia, nullo"
449,,Excutitur studio verum. Mortalia corda
450,,"Tunc Deus iste docet, cum sunt minus apta doceri,"
451,,"Cum nullum obsequium præstant, meritisque fatentur"
452,,Nil sese debere suis; tunc recta scientes
453,,Cum nil scire valent. Non illo tempore sensus
454,,"Humanos forsan dignatur numen inire,"
455,,"Cum propriis possunt per se discursibus uti,"
456,,Ne forte humanâ ratio divina coiret.”—_Sup Lucani_.
457,,
458,,
459,,[2] I have met with a singular tale to illustrate this spiritual
460,,theory of dreams.
461,,
462,,"Guntram, King of the Franks, was liberal to the poor, and he"
463,,himself experienced the wonderful effects of divine liberality. For
464,,one day as he was hunting in a forest he was separated from his
465,,companions and arrived at a little stream of water with only one
466,,comrade of tried and approved fidelity. Here he found himself
467,,"opprest by drowsiness, and reclining his head upon the servant’s"
468,,"lap went to sleep. The servant witnessed a wonderful thing, for he"
469,,saw a little beast (_bestiolam_) creep out of the mouth of his
470,,"sleeping master, and go immediately to the streamlet, which it"
471,,vainly attempted to cross. The servant drew his sword and laid it
472,,"across the water, over which the little beast easily past and crept"
473,,into a hole of a mountain on the opposite side; from whence it made
474,,"its appearance again in an hour, and returned by the same means"
475,,"into the King’s mouth. The King then awakened, and told his"
476,,companion that he had dreamt that he was arrived upon the bank of
477,,"an immense river, which he had crossed by a bridge of iron, and"
478,,from thence came to a mountain in which a great quantity of gold
479,,"was concealed. When the King had concluded, the servant related"
480,,"what he had beheld, and they both went to examine the mountain,"
481,,where upon digging they discovered an immense weight of gold.
482,,
483,,I stumbled upon this tale in a book entitled SPHINX
484,,"_Theologico-Philosophica. Authore Johanne Heidfeldio, Ecclesiaste"
485,,Ebersbachiano_. 1621.
486,,
487,,The same story is in Matthew of Westminster; it is added that
488,,Guntram applied the treasures thus found to pious uses.
489,,
490,,For the truth of this theory there is the evidence of a Monkish

569,,"Amid the air, such odors wafting now"
570,,"As erst came blended with the evening gale,"
571,,From Eden’s bowers of bliss. An angel form
572,,"Stood by the Maid; his wings, etherial white,"
573,,"Flash’d like the diamond in the noon-tide sun,"
574,,Dazzling her mortal eye: all else appear’d
575,,Her Theodore.
576,,Amazed she saw: the Fiend
577,,"Was fled, and on her ear the well-known voice"
578,,"Sounded, tho’ now more musically sweet"
579,,"Than ever yet had thrill’d her charmed soul,"
580,,When eloquent Affection fondly told
581,,The day-dreams of delight.
582,,“Beloved Maid!
583,,Lo! I am with thee! still thy Theodore!
584,,"Hearts in the holy bands of Love combin’d,"
585,,Death has no power to sever. Thou art mine!
586,,A little while and thou shalt dwell with me
587,,In scenes where Sorrow is not. Cheerily

589,,"Rough tho’ it be and painful, for the grave"
590,,Is but the threshold of Eternity.
591,,Favour’d of Heaven! to thee is given to view
592,,These secret realms. The bottom of the abyss
593,,"Thou treadest, Maiden! Here the dungeons are"
594,,Where bad men learn repentance; souls diseased
595,,Must have their remedy; and where disease
596,,"Is rooted deep, the remedy is long"
597,,"Perforce, and painful.”"
598,,"Thus the Spirit spake,"
599,,"And led the Maid along a narrow path,"
600,,"Dark gleaming to the light of far-off flames,"
601,,More dread than darkness. Soon the distant sound
602,,"Of clanking anvils, and the lengthened breath"
603,,Provoking fire are heard: and now they reach
604,,A wide expanded den where all around
605,,"Tremendous furnaces, with hellish blaze,"
606,,Flamed dreadful. At the heaving bellows stood
607,,"The meagre form of Care, and as he blew"
608,,"To augment the fire, the fire augmented scorch’d"
609,,His wretched limbs: sleepless for ever thus
610,,"He toil’d and toil’d, of toil to reap no end"
611,,But endless toil and never-ending woe.
612,,"An aged man went round the infernal vault,"
613,,Urging his workmen to their ceaseless task:
614,,"White were his locks, as is the wintry snow"
615,,On hoar Plinlimmon’s head. A golden staff

617,,Which whoso feels shall never feel again

629,,“Missioned Maid!”

631,,"Round each white furnace ply the unceasing toil,"
632,,Were Mammon’s slaves on earth. They did not spare
633,,"To wring from Poverty the hard-earn’d mite,"
634,,"They robb’d the orphan’s pittance, they could see"
635,,"Want’s asking eye unmoved; and therefore these,"
636,,"Ranged round the furnace, still must persevere"
637,,"In Mammon’s service; scorched by these fierce fires,"
638,,And frequent deluged by the o’erboiling ore:
639,,"Yet still so framed, that oft to quench their thirst"
640,,"Unquenchable, large draughts of molten gold[6]"
641,,"They drink insatiate, still with pain renewed,"
642,,Pain to destroy.”
643,,"So saying, her he led"
644,,"Forth from the dreadful cavern to a cell,"
645,,Brilliant with gem-born light. The rugged walls
646,,"Part gleam’d with gold, and part with silver ore"
647,,A milder radiance shone. The Carbuncle
648,,There its strong lustre like the flamy sun
649,,"Shot forth irradiate; from the earth beneath,"
650,,And from the roof a diamond light emits;
651,,Rubies and amethysts their glows commix’d
652,,"With the gay topaz, and the softer ray"
653,,"Shot from the sapphire, and the emerald’s hue,"
654,,And bright pyropus.
655,,"There on golden seats,"
656,,"A numerous, sullen, melancholy train"
657,,"Sat silent. “Maiden, these,” said Theodore,"
658,,Are they who let the love of wealth absorb
659,,All other passions; in their souls that vice
660,,"Struck deeply-rooted, like the poison-tree"
661,,That with its shade spreads barrenness around.
662,,"These, Maid! were men by no atrocious crime"
663,,"Blacken’d, no fraud, nor ruffian violence:"
664,,"Men of fair dealing, and respectable"
665,,"On earth, but such as only for themselves"
666,,"Heap’d up their treasures, deeming all their wealth"
667,,"Their own, and given to them, by partial Heaven,"
668,,"To bless them only: therefore here they sit,"
669,,"Possessed of gold enough, and by no pain"
670,,"Tormented, save the knowledge of the bliss"
671,,"They lost, and vain repentance. Here they dwell,"
672,,"Loathing these useless treasures, till the hour"
673,,Of general restitution.”
674,,"Thence they past,"
675,,"And now arrived at such a gorgeous dome,"
676,,As even the pomp of Eastern opulence
677,,Could never equal: wandered thro’ its halls
678,,A numerous train; some with the red-swoln eye
679,,"Of riot, and intemperance-bloated cheek;"
680,,"Some pale and nerveless, and with feeble step,"
681,,And eyes lack-lustre.
682,,"Maiden? said her guide,"
683,,"These are the wretched slaves of Appetite,"
684,,Curst with their wish enjoyed. The epicure
685,,"Here pampers his foul frame, till the pall’d sense"
686,,Loaths at the banquet; the voluptuous here
687,,"Plunge in the tempting torrent of delight,"
688,,"And sink in misery. All they wish’d on earth,"
689,,"Possessing here, whom have they to accuse,"
690,,"But their own folly, for the lot they chose?"
691,,"Yet, for that these injured themselves alone,"
692,,"They to the house of Penitence may hie,"
693,,"And, by a long and painful regimen,"
694,,To wearied Nature her exhausted powers
695,,"Restore, till they shall learn to form the wish"
696,,"Of wisdom, and Almighty Goodness grants"
697,,That prize to him who seeks it.”
698,,"Whilst he spake,"
699,,"The board is spread. With bloated paunch, and eye"
700,,"Fat swoln, and legs whose monstrous size disgraced"
701,,"The human form divine, their caterer,"
702,,"Hight Gluttony, set forth the smoaking feast."
703,,"And by his side came on a brother form,"
704,,"With fiery cheek of purple hue, and red"
705,,"And scurfy-white, mix’d motley; his gross bulk,"
706,,"Like some huge hogshead shapen’d, as applied."
707,,Him had antiquity with mystic rites
708,,"Ador’d, to him the sons of Greece, and thine"
709,,"Imperial Rome, on many an altar pour’d"
710,,"The victim blood, with godlike titles graced,"
711,,"Bacchus, or Dionusus; son of Jove,"
712,,"Deem’d falsely, for from Folly’s ideot form"
713,,"He sprung, what time Madness, with furious hand,"
714,,Seiz’d on the laughing female. At one birth
715,,"She brought the brethren, menial here, above"
716,,"Reigning with sway supreme, and oft they hold"
717,,"High revels: mid the Monastery’s gloom,"
718,,"The sacrifice is spread, when the grave voice"
719,,"Episcopal, proclaims approaching day"
720,,"Of visitation, or Churchwardens meet"
721,,To save the wretched many from the gripe
722,,"Of eager Poverty, or mid thy halls"
723,,"Of London, mighty Mayor! rich Aldermen,"
724,,Of coming feast hold converse.
725,,"Otherwhere,"
726,,"For tho’ allied in nature as in blood,"
727,,"They hold divided sway, his brother lifts"
728,,His spungy sceptre. In the noble domes
729,,"Of Princes, and state-wearied Ministers,"
730,,Maddening he reigns; and when the affrighted mind
731,,Casts o’er a long career of guilt and blood
732,,"Its eye reluctant, then his aid is sought"
733,,To lull the worm of Conscience to repose.
734,,"He too the halls of country Squires frequents,"
735,,But chiefly loves the learned gloom that shades
736,,"Thy offspring Rhedycina! and thy walls,"
737,,Granta! nightly libations there to him
738,,"Profuse are pour’d, till from the dizzy brain"
739,,"Triangles, Circles, Parallelograms,"
740,,"Moods, Tenses, Dialects, and Demigods,"
741,,And Logic and Theology are swept
742,,By the red deluge.
743,,Unmolested there
744,,"He reigns; till comes at length the general feast,"
745,,Septennial sacrifice; then when the sons
746,,"Of England meet, with watchful care to chuse"
747,,"Their delegates, wise, independent men,"
748,,"Unbribing and unbrib’d, and cull’d to guard"
749,,Their rights and charters from the encroaching grasp
750,,Of greedy Power: then all the joyful land
751,,"Join in his sacrifices, so inspir’d"
752,,To make the important choice.
753,,The observing Maid
754,,"Address’d her guide, “These Theodore, thou sayest"
755,,"Are men, who pampering their foul appetites,"
756,,"Injured themselves alone. But where are they,"
757,,"The worst of villains, viper-like, who coil"
758,,"Around the guileless female, so to sting"
759,,The heart that loves them?”
760,,"“Them,” the spirit replied,"
761,,A long and dreadful punishment awaits.
762,,"For when the prey of want and infamy,"
763,,"Lower and lower still the victim sinks,"
764,,"Even to the depth of shame, not one lewd word,"
765,,One impious imprecation from her lips
766,,"Escapes, nay not a thought of evil lurks"
767,,"In the polluted mind, that does not plead"
768,,"Before the throne of Justice, thunder-tongued"
769,,Against the foul Seducer.”
770,,Now they reach’d
771,,The house of Penitence. Credulity
772,,"Stood at the gate, stretching her eager head"
773,,"As tho’ to listen; on her vacant face,"
774,,A smile that promis’d premature assent;
775,,"Tho’ her Regret behind, a meagre Fiend,"
776,,Disciplin’d sorely.
777,,"Here they entered in,"
778,,"And now arrived where, as in study tranced,"
779,,"She sat, the Mistress of the Dome. Her face"
780,,"Spake that composed severity, that knows"
781,,"No angry impulse, no weak tenderness,"
782,,Resolved and calm. Before her lay that Book
783,,"That hath the words of Life; and as she read,"
784,,"Sometimes a tear would trickle down her cheek,"
785,,Tho’ heavenly joy beam’d in her eye the while.
786,,"Leaving her undisturb’d, to the first ward"
787,,"Of this great Lazar-house, the Angel led"
788,,The favour’d Maid of Orleans. Kneeling down
789,,"On the hard stone that their bare knees had worn,"
790,,"In sackcloth robed, a numerous train appear’d:"
791,,"Hard-featured some, and some demurely grave;"
792,,"Yet such expression stealing from the eye,"
793,,"As tho’, that only naked, all the rest"
794,,"Was one close fitting mask. A scoffing Fiend,"
795,,"For Fiend he was, tho’ wisely serving here"
796,,"Mock’d at his patients, and did often pour"
797,,"Ashes upon them, and then bid them say"
798,,"Their prayers aloud, and then he louder laughed:"
799,,"For these were Hypocrites, on earth revered"
800,,"As holy ones, who did in public tell"
801,,"Their beads, and make long prayers, and cross themselves,"
802,,"And call themselves most miserable sinners,"
803,,That so they might be deem’d most pious saints;
804,,"And go all filth, and never let a smile"
805,,"Bend their stern muscles, gloomy, sullen men,"
806,,"Barren of all affection, and all this"
807,,"To please their God, forsooth! and therefore Scorn"
808,,"Grinn’d at his patients, making them repeat"
809,,"Their solemn farce, with keenest raillery"
810,,"Tormenting; but if earnest in their prayer,"
811,,They pour’d the silent sorrows of the soul
812,,"To Heaven, then did they not regard his mocks"
813,,"Which then came painless, and Humility"
814,,"Soon rescued them, and led to Penitence,"
815,,That She might lead to Heaven.
816,,"From thence they came,"
817,,"Where, in the next ward, a most wretched band"
818,,Groan’d underneath the bitter tyranny
819,,"Of a fierce Daemon. His coarse hair was red,"
820,,"Pale grey his eyes, and blood-shot; and his face"
821,,Wrinkled by such a smile as Malice wears
822,,"In ecstacy. Well-pleased he went around,"
823,,"Plunging his dagger in the hearts of some,"
824,,"Or probing with a poison’d lance their breasts,"
825,,Or placing coals of fire within their wounds;
826,,"Or seizing some within his mighty grasp,"
827,,"He fix’d them on a stake, and then drew back,"
828,,And laugh’d to see them writhe.
829,,"“These,” said the Spirit,"
830,,"Are taught by Cruelty, to loath the lives"
831,,They led themselves. Here are those wicked men
832,,Who loved to exercise their tyrant power
833,,On speechless brutes; bad husbands undergo
834,,A long purgation here; the traffickers
835,,In human flesh here too are disciplined.
836,,Till by their suffering they have equall’d all
837,,"The miseries they inflicted, all the mass"
838,,"Of wretchedness caused by the wars they waged,"
839,,"The towns they burnt, for they who bribe to war"
840,,"Are guilty of the blood, the widows left"
841,,"In want, the slave or led to suicide,"
842,,Or murdered by the foul infected air
843,,"Of his close dungeon, or more sad than all,"
844,,"His virtue lost, his very soul enslaved,"
845,,And driven by woe to wickedness.
846,,"These next,"
847,,"Whom thou beholdest in this dreary room,"
848,,"So sullen, and with such an eye of hate"
849,,"Each on the other scowling, these have been"
850,,False friends. Tormented by their own dark thoughts
851,,Here they dwell: in the hollow of their hearts
852,,"There is a worm that feeds, and tho’ thou seest"
853,,That skilful leech who willingly would heal
854,,"The ill they suffer, judging of all else"
855,,"By their own evil standard, they suspect"
856,,"The aid be vainly proffers, lengthening thus"
857,,By vice its punishment.”
858,,"“But who are these,”"
859,,"The Maid exclaim’d, “that robed in flowing lawn,"
860,,"And mitred, or in scarlet, and in caps"
861,,"Like Cardinals, I see in every ward,"
862,,Performing menial service at the beck
863,,Of all who bid them?”
864,,"Theodore replied,"
865,,These men are they who in the name of CHRIST
866,,"Did heap up wealth, and arrogating power,"
867,,"Did make men bow the knee, and call themselves"
868,,Most Reverend Graces and Right Reverend Lords.
869,,"They dwelt in palaces, in purple clothed,"
870,,And in fine linen: therefore are they here;
871,,"And tho’ they would not minister on earth,"
872,,Here penanced they perforce must minister:
873,,"For he, the lowly man of Nazareth,"
874,,"Hath said, his kingdom is not of the world.”"
875,,"So Saying on they past, and now arrived"
876,,"Where such a hideous ghastly groupe abode,"
877,,"That the Maid gazed with half-averting eye,"
878,,"And shudder’d: each one was a loathly corpse,"
879,,"The worm did banquet on his putrid prey,"
880,,Yet had they life and feeling exquisite
881,,Tho’ motionless and mute.
882,,“Most wretched men
883,,"Are these, the angel cried. These, Joan, are bards,"
884,,Whose loose lascivious lays perpetuate
885,,"Who sat them down, deliberately lewd,"
886,,So to awake and pamper lust in minds
887,,Unborn; and therefore foul of body now
888,,"As then they were of soul, they here abide"
889,,Long as the evil works they left on earth
890,,Shall live to taint mankind. A dreadful doom!
891,,Yet amply merited by that bad man
892,,Who prostitutes the sacred gift of song!”
893,,"And now they reached a huge and massy pile,"
894,,"Massy it seem’d, and yet in every blast"
895,,"As to its ruin shook. There, porter fit,"
896,,Remorse for ever his sad vigils kept.
897,,"Pale, hollow-eyed, emaciate, sleepless wretch."
898,,"Inly he groan’d, or, starting, wildly shriek’d,"
899,,"Aye as the fabric tottering from its base,"
900,,"Threatened its fall, and so expectant still"
901,,Lived in the dread of danger still delayed.
902,,"They enter’d there a large and lofty dome,"
903,,O’er whose black marble sides a dim drear light
904,,Struggled with darkness from the unfrequent lamp.
905,,"Enthroned around, the Murderers of Mankind,"
906,,"Monarchs, the great! the glorious! the august!"
907,,"Each bearing on his brow a crown of fire,"
908,,"Sat stern and silent. Nimrod he was there,"
909,,First King the mighty hunter; and that Chief
910,,"Who did belie his mother’s fame, that so"
911,,He might be called young Ammon. In this court
912,,"Cæsar was crown’d, accurst liberticide;"
913,,"And he who murdered Tully, that cold villain,"
914,,"Octavius, tho’ the courtly minion’s lyre"
915,,"Hath hymn’d his praise, tho’ Maro sung to him,"
916,,And when Death levelled to original clay
917,,"The royal carcase, Flattery, fawning low,"
918,,"Fell at his feet, and worshipped the new God."
919,,"Titus was here,[7] the Conqueror of the Jews,"
920,,He the Delight of human-kind misnamed;
921,,"Cæsars and Soldans, Emperors and Kings,"
922,,"Here they were all, all who for glory fought,"
923,,Here in the Court of Glory reaping now
924,,The meed they merited.
925,,As gazing round
926,,"The Virgin mark’d the miserable train,"
927,,A deep and hollow voice from one went forth;
928,,"“Thou who art come to view our punishment,"
929,,"Maiden of Orleans! hither turn thine eyes,"
930,,For I am he whose bloody victories
931,,"Thy power hath rendered vain. Lo! I am here,"
932,,"The hero conqueror of Azincour,"
933,,"Henry of England!—wretched that I am,"
934,,"I might have reigned in happiness and peace,"
935,,"My coffers full, my subjects undisturb’d,"
936,,And Plenty and Prosperity had loved
937,,To dwell amongst them: but mine eye beheld
938,,"The realm of France, by faction tempest-torn,"
939,,And therefore I did think that it would fall
940,,An easy prey. I persecuted those
941,,"Who taught new doctrines, tho’ they taught the truth:"
942,,And when I heard of thousands by the sword
943,,"Cut off, or blasted by the pestilence,"
944,,"I calmly counted up my proper gains,"
945,,And sent new herds to slaughter. Temperate
946,,"Myself, no blood that mutinied, no vice"
947,,"Tainting my private life, I sent abroad"
948,,"Murder and Rape; and therefore am I doom’d,"
949,,"Like these imperial Sufferers, crown’d with fire,"
950,,"Here to remain, till Man’s awaken’d eye"

970,,"(List daughter!) in a black and hollow vault,"
971,,"Where day is never seen; there shines no sun,"
972,,But flaming horror of consuming fires;
973,,"A lightless sulphur, choak’d with smoaky foggs"
974,,Of an infected darkness. In this place
975,,Dwell many thousand thousand sundry sorts
976,,Of never-dying deaths; there damned souls
977,,"Roar without pity, there are gluttons fed"
978,,With toads and adders; there is burning oil

981,,"There is the murderer for ever stabb’d,"

1039,,"In front a beardless youth, whose smiling eye"
1040,,"Beam’d promise, but behind, withered and old,"
1041,,And all unlovely. Underneath his feet
1042,,"Lay records trampled, and the laurel wreath"
1043,,Now rent and faded: in his hand he held
1044,,"An hour-glass, and as fall the restless sands,"
1045,,So pass the lives of men. By him they past
1046,,"Along the darksome cave, and reach’d a stream,"
1047,,"Still rolling onward its perpetual waves,"
1048,,Noiseless and undisturbed. Here they ascend
1049,,"A Bark unpiloted, that down the flood,"
1050,,"Borne by the current, rush’d. The circling stream,"
1051,,"Returning to itself, an island form’d;"

1057,,"They land, a mighty fabric meets their eyes,"
1058,,Seen by its gem-born light. Of adamant
1059,,"The pile was framed, for ever to abide"
1060,,Firm in eternal strength. Before the gate
1061,,"Stood eager Expectation, as to list"
1062,,"The half-heard murmurs issuing from within,"
1063,,"Her mouth half-open’d, and her head stretch’d forth."
1064,,"On the other side there stood an aged Crone,"
1065,,Listening to every breath of air; she knew
1066,,"Vague suppositions and uncertain dreams,"
1067,,"Of what was soon to come, for she would mark"
1068,,"The paley glow-worm’s self-created light,"
1069,,"And argue thence of kingdoms overthrown,"
1070,,And desolated nations; ever fill’d
1071,,"With undetermin’d terror, as she heard"
1072,,"Or distant screech-owl, or the regular beat"
1073,,Of evening death-watch.
1074,,"“Maid,” the Spirit cried,"
1075,,"Here, robed in shadows, dwells Futurity."
1076,,"There is no eye hath seen her secret form,"

1080,,"The Damsel for a moment paus’d,"

1091,,"To memory dear, or visioned out by hope,"
1092,,"Where thou would’st now be present? form the wish,"

1094,,His closing speech
1095,,"Yet sounded on her ear, and lo! they stood"
1096,,"Swift as the sudden thought that guided them,"
1097,,Within the little cottage that she loved.
1098,,"“He sleeps! the good man sleeps!” enrapt she cried,"
1099,,As bending o’er her Uncle’s lowly bed
1100,,Her eye retraced his features. “See the beads

1102,,"Remembering me, his child, in every prayer."
1103,,"Oh! quiet be thy sleep, thou dear old man!"
1104,,Good Angels guard thy rest! and when thine hour

1124,,From yonder woodbine porch? how have we gazed
1125,,"Into the dark deep sky, till the baffled soul,"
1126,,"Lost in the infinite, returned, and felt"
1127,,"The burthen of her bodily load, and yearned"
1128,,"For freedom! Maid, in yonder evening slar"

1133,,Then on her ear
1134,,"The lonely song of adoration rose,"
1135,,"Sweet as the cloister’d virgins vesper hymn,"
1136,,"Whose spirit, happily dead to earthly hopes"
1137,,Already lives in Heaven. Abrupt the song
1138,,"Ceas’d, tremulous and quick a cry"
1139,,"Of joyful wonder rous’d the astonish’d Maid,"
1140,,And instant Madelon was in her arms;
1141,,"No airy form, no unsubstantial shape,"
1142,,"She felt her friend, she prest her to her heart,"
1143,,Their tears of rapture mingled.
1144,,She drew back
1145,,"And eagerly she gazed on Madelon,"
1146,,Then fell upon her neck again and wept.
1147,,"No more she saw the long-drawn lines of grief,"
1148,,"The emaciate form, the hue of sickliness,"
1149,,The languid eye: youth’s loveliest freshness now
1150,,"Mantled her cheek, whose every lineament"
1151,,"Bespake the soul at rest, a holy calm,"
1152,,A deep and full tranquillity of bliss.
1153,,
1154,,"“Thou then art come, my first and dearest friend!”"
1155,,"The well known voice of Madelon began,"
1156,,“Thou then art come! and was thy pilgrimage
1157,,"So short on earth? and was it painful too,"
1158,,Painful and short as mine? but blessed they
1159,,Who from the crimes and miseries of the world
1160,,Early escape!”
1161,,"“Nay,” Theodore replied,"
1162,,She hath not yet fulfill’d her mortal work.
1163,,Permitted visitant from earth she comes
1164,,"To see the seat of rest, and oftentimes"
1165,,"In sorrow shall her soul remember this,"
1166,,And patient of the transitory woe
1167,,Partake the anticipated peace again.”
1168,,"“Soon be that work perform’d!” the Maid exclaimed,"
1169,,"“O Madelon! O Theodore! my soul,"
1170,,"Spurning the cold communion of the world,"
1171,,"Will dwell with you! but I shall patiently,"
1172,,"Yea even with joy, endure the allotted ills"
1173,,Of which the memory in this better state
1174,,"Shall heighten bliss. That hour of agony,"
1175,,"When, Madelon, I felt thy dying grasp,"
1176,,"And from thy forehead wiped the dews of death,"
1177,,The very horrors of that hour assume
1178,,A shape that now delights.”
1179,,“O earliest friend!
1180,,"I too remember,” Madelon replied,"
1181,,"“That hour, thy looks of watchful agony,"
1182,,The suppressed grief that struggled in thine eye
1183,,Endearing love’s last kindness. Thou didst know
1184,,With what a deep and melancholy joy
1185,,I felt the hour draw on: but who can speak
1186,,"The unutterable transport, when mine eyes,"
1187,,"As from a long and dreary dream, unclosed"
1188,,"Amid this peaceful vale, unclos’d on him,"
1189,,"My Arnaud! he had built me up a bower,"
1190,,"A bower of rest.—See, Maiden, where he comes,"
1191,,"His manly lineaments, his beaming eye"
1192,,"The same, but now a holier innocence"
1193,,"Sits on his cheek, and loftier thoughts illume"
1194,,The enlighten’d glance.”
1195,,"They met, what joy was theirs"
1196,,"He best can feel, who for a dear friend dead"
1197,,Has wet the midnight pillow with his tears.

1199,,Fair was the scene around; an ample vale
1200,,Whose mountain circle at the distant verge
1201,,Lay softened on the sight; the near ascent
1202,,"Rose bolder up, in part abrupt and bare,"
1203,,Part with the ancient majesty of woods
1204,,"Adorn’d, or lifting high its rocks sublime."
1205,,"The river’s liquid radiance roll’d beneath,"
1206,,Beside the bower of Madelon it wound
1207,,"A broken stream, whose shallows, tho’ the waves"
1208,,"Roll’d on their way with rapid melody,"
1209,,"A child might tread. Behind, an orange grove"
1210,,Its gay green foliage starr’d with golden fruit;
1211,,But with what odours did their blossoms load
1212,,The passing gale of eve! less thrilling sweet
1213,,"Rose from the marble’s perforated floor,"
1214,,"Where kneeling at her prayers, the Moorish queen"
1215,,"Inhaled the cool delight,[8] and whilst she asked"
1216,,"The Prophet for his promised paradise,"
1217,,Shaped from the present scene its utmost joys.
1218,,A goodly scene! fair as that faery land
1219,,"Where Arthur lives, by ministering spirits borne"
1220,,From Camlan’s bloody banks; or as the groves
1221,,"Of earliest Eden, where, so legends say,"
1222,,"Enoch abides, and he who rapt away"
1223,,"By fiery steeds, and chariotted in fire,"
1224,,Past in his mortal form the eternal ways;
1225,,"And John, beloved of Christ, enjoying there"
1226,,"The beatific vision, sometimes seen"
1227,,"The distant dawning of eternal day,"
1228,,Till all things be fulfilled.
1229,,“Survey this scene!”
1230,,"So Theodore address’d the Maid of Arc,"
1231,,"“There is no evil here, no wretchedness,"
1232,,It is the Heaven of those who nurst on earth
1233,,Their nature’s gentlest feelings. Yet not here
1234,,"Centering their joys, but with a patient hope,"
1235,,Waiting the allotted hour when capable
1236,,"Of loftier callings, to a better state"
1237,,They pass; and hither from that better state
1238,,"Frequent they come, preserving so those ties"
1239,,That thro’ the infinite progressiveness
1240,,Complete our perfect bliss.
1241,,"“Even such, so blest,"
1242,,Save that the memory of no sorrows past
1243,,"Heightened the present joy, our world was once,"
1244,,In the first æra of its innocence
1245,,Ere man had learnt to bow the knee to man.
1246,,"Was there a youth whom warm affection fill’d,"
1247,,He spake his honest heart; the earliest fruits
1248,,"His toil produced, the sweetest flowers that deck’d"
1249,,"The sunny bank, he gather’d for the maid,"
1250,,Nor she disdain’d the gift; for Vice not yet
1251,,"Had burst the dungeons of her hell, and rear’d"
1252,,Those artificial boundaries that divide
1253,,Man from his species. State of blessedness!
1254,,Till that ill-omen’d hour when Cain’s stern son
1255,,"Delved in the bowels of the earth for gold,"
1256,,Accursed bane of virtue! of such force
1257,,"As poets feign dwelt in the Gorgon’s locks,"
1258,,"Which whoso saw, felt instant the life-blood"
1259,,"Cold curdle in his veins, the creeping flesh"
1260,,"Grew stiff with horror, and the heart forgot"
1261,,To beat. Accursed hour! for man no more
1262,,"To Justice paid his homage, but forsook"
1263,,"Her altars, and bow’d down before the shrine"
1264,,"Of Wealth and Power, the Idols he had made."
1265,,"Then Hell enlarged herself, her gates flew wide,"
1266,,Her legion fiends rush’d forth. Oppression came
1267,,"Whose frown is desolation, and whose breath"
1268,,"Blasts like the Pestilence; and Poverty,"
1269,,"A meagre monster, who with withering touch"
1270,,"Makes barren all the better part of man,"
1271,,Mother of Miseries. Then the goodly earth
1272,,"Which God had fram’d for happiness, became"
1273,,"One theatre of woe, and all that God"
1274,,"Had given to bless free men, these tyrant fiends"
1275,,His bitterest curses made. Yet for the best
1276,,"Hath he ordained all things, the ALL-WISE!"
1277,,For by experience rous’d shall man at length
1278,,"Dash down his Moloch-Idols, Samson-like"
1279,,"And burst his fetters, only strong whilst strong"
1280,,Believed. Then in the bottomless abyss
1281,,"Oppression shall be chain’d, and Poverty"
1282,,"Die, and with her, her brood of Miseries;"
1283,,And Virtue and Equality preserve
1284,,"The reign of Love, and Earth shall once again"
1285,,"Be Paradise, whilst Wisdom shall secure"
1286,,The state of bliss which Ignorance betrayed.”
1287,,
1288,,"“Oh age of happiness!” the Maid exclaim’d,"
1289,,"Roll fast thy current, Time till that blest age"
1290,,"Arrive! and happy thou my Theodore,"
1291,,Permitted thus to see the sacred depths
1292,,Of wisdom!”

1411,,
1412,,There dwelt at Bethlehem a Jewish maid
1413,,"And Zillah was her name, so passing fair"
1414,,That all Judea spake the damsel’s praise.
1415,,He who had seen her eyes’ dark radiance
1416,,"How quick it spake the soul, and what a soul"
1417,,"Beam’d in its mild effulgence, woe was he!"
1418,,"For not in solitude, for not in crowds,"
1419,,"Might he escape remembrance, or avoid"
1420,,"Her imaged form that followed every where,"
1421,,"And fill’d the heart, and fix’d the absent eye."
1422,,"Woe was he, for her bosom own’d no love"
1423,,"Save the strong ardours of religious zeal,"
1424,,For Zillah on her God had centered all
1425,,Her spirit’s deep affections. So for her
1426,,"Her tribes-men sigh’d in vain, yet reverenced"
1427,,The obdurate virtue that destroyed their hopes.
1428,,
1429,,"One man there was, a vain and wretched man,"
1430,,"Who saw, desired, despair’d, and hated her."
1431,,His sensual eye had gloated on her cheek
1432,,Even till the flush of angry modesty
1433,,"Gave it new charms, and made him gloat the more."
1434,,"She loath’d the man, for Hamuel’s eye was bold,"
1435,,And the strong workings of brute selfishness
1436,,Had moulded his broad features; and she fear’d
1437,,The bitterness of wounded vanity
1438,,That with a fiendish hue would overcast
1439,,"His faint and lying smile. Nor vain her fear,"
1440,,For Hamuel vowed revenge and laid a plot
1441,,Against her virgin fame. He spread abroad
1442,,"Whispers that travel fast, and ill reports"
1443,,That soon obtain belief; that Zillah’s eye
1444,,When in the temple heaven-ward it was rais’d
1445,,"Did swim with rapturous zeal, but there were those"
1446,,Who had beheld the enthusiast’s melting glance
1447,,With other feelings fill’d; that ’twas a task
1448,,Of easy sort to play the saint by day
1449,,"Before the public eye, but that all eyes"
1450,,"Were closed at night; that Zillah’s life was foul,"
1451,,Yea forfeit to the law.
1452,,
1453,,Shame—shame to man
1454,,That he should trust so easily the tongue
1455,,That stabs another’s fame! the ill report
1456,,"Was heard, repeated, and believed,—and soon,"
1457,,For Hamuel by most damned artifice
1458,,"Produced such semblances of guilt, the Maid"
1459,,Was judged to shameful death.
1460,,Without the walls
1461,,"There was a barren field; a place abhorr’d,"
1462,,For it was there where wretched criminals
1463,,"Were done to die; and there they built the stake,"
1464,,"And piled the fuel round, that should consume"
1465,,"The accused Maid, abandon’d, as it seem’d,"
1466,,By God and man. The assembled Bethlemites
1467,,"Beheld the scene, and when they saw the Maid"
1468,,"Bound to the stake, with what calm holiness"
1469,,"She lifted up her patient looks to Heaven,"
1470,,They doubted of her guilt. With other thoughts
1471,,"Stood Hamuel near the pile, him savage joy"
1472,,"Led thitherward, but now within his heart"
1473,,"Unwonted feelings stirr’d, and the first pangs"
1474,,"Of wakening guilt, anticipating Hell."
1475,,The eye of Zillah as it glanced around
1476,,"Fell on the murderer once, but not in wrath;"
1477,,"And therefore like a dagger it had fallen,"
1478,,Had struck into his soul a cureless wound.
1479,,Conscience! thou God within us! not in the hour
1480,,"Of triumph, dost thou spare the guilty wretch,"
1481,,Not in the hour of infamy and death
1482,,Forsake the virtuous! they draw near the stake—
1483,,And lo! the torch! hold hold your erring hands!
1484,,Yet quench the rising flames!—they rise! they spread!
1485,,They reach the suffering Maid! oh God protect
1486,,The innocent one!
1487,,"They rose, they spread, they raged—"
1488,,The breath of God went forth; the ascending fire
1489,,"Beneath its influence bent, and all its flames"
1490,,"In one long lightning flash collecting fierce,"
1491,,Darted and blasted Hamuel—him alone.
1492,,Hark—what a fearful scream the multitude
1493,,Pour forth!—and yet more miracles! the stake
1494,,"Buds out, and spreads its light green leaves and bowers"
1495,,"The innocent Maid, and roses bloom around,"
1496,,"Now first beheld since Paradise was lost,"
1497,,And fill with Eden odours all the air.

1502,,The Complaints of the Poor
1503,,
1504,,
1505,,And wherefore do the Poor complain?
1506,,"The rich man asked of me,—"
1507,,"Come walk abroad with me, I said"
1508,,And I will answer thee.
1509,,
1510,,Twas evening and the frozen streets
1511,,"Were cheerless to behold,"
1512,,"And we were wrapt and coated well,"
1513,,And yet we were a-cold.
1514,,
1515,,"We met an old bare-headed man,"
1516,,"His locks were few and white,"
1517,,I ask’d him what he did abroad
1518,,In that cold winter’s night:
1519,,
1520,,"’Twas bitter keen indeed, he said,"
1521,,"But at home no fire had he,"
1522,,"And therefore, he had come abroad"
1523,,To ask for charity.
1524,,
1525,,"We met a young bare-footed child,"
1526,,"And she begg’d loud and bold,"
1527,,I ask’d her what she did abroad
1528,,When the wind it blew so cold;
1529,,
1530,,She said her father was at home
1531,,"And he lay sick a-bed,"
1532,,And therefore was it she was sent
1533,,Abroad to beg for bread.
1534,,
1535,,We saw a woman sitting down
1536,,"Upon a stone to rest,"
1537,,She had a baby at her back
1538,,And another at her breast;
1539,,
1540,,I ask’d her why she loiter’d there
1541,,When the wind it was so chill;
1542,,She turn’d her head and bade the child
1543,,That scream’d behind be still.
1544,,
1545,,She told us that her husband served
1546,,"A soldier, far away,"
1547,,And therefore to her parish she
1548,,Was begging back her way.
1549,,
1550,,We met a girl; her dress was loose
1551,,"And sunken was her eye,"
1552,,Who with the wanton’s hollow voice
1553,,Address’d the passers by;
1554,,
1555,,I ask’d her what there was in guilt
1556,,That could her heart allure
1557,,"To shame, disease, and late remorse?"
1558,,"She answer’d, she was poor."
1559,,
1560,,I turn’d me to the rich man then
1561,,"For silently stood he,"
1562,,"You ask’d me why the Poor complain,"
1563,,And these have answer’d thee.

1568,,Metrical Letter
1569,,
1570,,_Written from London_
1571,,
1572,,
1573,,"Margaret! my Cousin!—nay, you must not smile;"
1574,,I love the homely and familiar phrase;
1575,,"And I will call thee Cousin Margaret,"
1576,,However quaint amid the measured line
1577,,The good old term appears. Oh! it looks ill
1578,,"When delicate tongues disclaim old terms of kin,"
1579,,Sirring and Madaming as civilly
1580,,As if the road between the heart and lips
1581,,Were such a weary and Laplandish way
1582,,That the poor travellers came to the red gates
1583,,"Half frozen. Trust me Cousin Margaret,"
1584,,For many a day my Memory has played
1585,,"The creditor with me on your account,"
1586,,And made me shame to think that I should owe
1587,,"So long the debt of kindness. But in truth,"
1588,,"Like Christian on his pilgrimage, I bear"
1589,,"So heavy a pack of business, that albeit"
1590,,"I toil on mainly, in our twelve hours race"
1591,,Time leaves me distanced. Loath indeed were I
1592,,That for a moment you should lay to me
1593,,"Unkind neglect; mine, Margaret, is a heart"
1594,,"That smokes not, yet methinks there should be some"
1595,,Who know how warm it beats. I am not one
1596,,Who can play off my smiles and courtesies
1597,,To every Lady of her lap dog tired
1598,,Who wants a play-thing; I am no sworn friend
1599,,"Of half-an-hour, as apt to leave as love;"
1600,,Mine are no mushroom feelings that spring up
1601,,"At once without a seed and take no root,"
1602,,Wiseliest distrusted. In a narrow sphere
1603,,The little circle of domestic life
1604,,I would be known and loved; the world beyond
1605,,"Is not for me. But Margaret, sure I think"
1606,,"That you should know me well, for you and I"
1607,,"Grew up together, and when we look back"
1608,,Upon old times our recollections paint
1609,,The same familiar faces. Did I wield
1610,,The wand of Merlin’s magic I would make
1611,,"Brave witchcraft. We would have a faery ship,"
1612,,"Aye, a new Ark, as in that other flood"
1613,,"That cleansed the sons of Anak from the earth,"
1614,,The Sylphs should waft us to some goodly isle
1615,,Like that where whilome old Apollidon
1616,,Built up his blameless spell; and I would bid
1617,,"The Sea Nymphs pile around their coral bowers,"
1618,,"That we might stand upon the beach, and mark"
1619,,"The far-off breakers shower their silver spray,"
1620,,And hear the eternal roar whose pleasant sound
1621,,Told us that never mariner should reach
1622,,Our quiet coast. In such a blessed isle
1623,,"We might renew the days of infancy,"
1624,,"And Life like a long childhood pass away,"
1625,,"Without one care. It may be, Margaret,"
1626,,"That I shall yet be gathered to my friends,"
1627,,For I am not of those who live estranged
1628,,"Of choice, till at the last they join their race"
1629,,"In the family vault. If so, if I should lose,"
1630,,"Like my old friend the Pilgrim, this huge pack"
1631,,"So heavy on my shoulders, I and mine"
1632,,Will end our pilgrimage most pleasantly.
1633,,"If not, if I should never get beyond"
1634,,"This Vanity town, there is another world"
1635,,"Where friends will meet. And often, Margaret,"
1636,,"I gaze at night into the boundless sky,"
1637,,"And think that I shall there be born again,"
1638,,The exalted native of some better star;
1639,,And like the rude American I hope
1640,,To find in Heaven the things I loved on earth.

1652,,
1653,,The circumstance related in the following Ballad happened about forty
1654,,years ago in a village adjacent to Bristol. A person who was present at
1655,,"the funeral, told me the story and the particulars of the interment, as"
1656,,I have versified them.
1657,,
1658,,There was an old man breaking stones
1659,,"To mend the turnpike way,"
1660,,He sat him down beside a brook
1661,,"And out his bread and cheese he took,"
1662,,For now it was mid-day.
1663,,
1664,,"He lent his back against a post,"
1665,,His feet the brook ran by;
1666,,"And there were water-cresses growing,"
1667,,And pleasant was the water’s flowing
1668,,For he was hot and dry.
1669,,
1670,,A soldier with his knapsack on
1671,,"Came travelling o’er the down,"
1672,,"The sun was strong and he was tired,"
1673,,And of the old man he enquired
1674,,How far to Bristol town.
1675,,
1676,,Half an hour’s walk for a young man
1677,,By lanes and fields and stiles.
1678,,"But you the foot-path do not know,"
1679,,And if along the road you go
1680,,Why then ’tis three good miles.
1681,,
1682,,The soldier took his knapsack off
1683,,For he was hot and dry;
1684,,And out his bread and cheese he took
1685,,And he sat down beside the brook
1686,,To dine in company.
1687,,
1688,,"Old friend! in faith, the soldier says"
1689,,I envy you almost;
1690,,My shoulders have been sorely prest
1691,,"And I should like to sit and rest,"
1692,,My back against that post.
1693,,
1694,,In such a sweltering day as this
1695,,A knapsack is the devil!
1696,,And if on t’other side I sat
1697,,It would not only spoil our chat
1698,,But make me seem uncivil.
1699,,
1700,,The old man laugh’d and moved. I wish
1701,,It were a great-arm’d chair!
1702,,But this may help a man at need;
1703,,And yet it was a cursed deed
1704,,That ever brought it there.
1705,,
1706,,There’s a poor girl lies buried here
1707,,Beneath this very place.
1708,,The earth upon her corpse is prest
1709,,This stake is driven into her breast
1710,,And a stone is on her face.
1711,,
1712,,The soldier had but just lent back
1713,,And now he half rose up.
1714,,"There’s sure no harm in dining here,"
1715,,My friend? and yet to be sincere
1716,,I should not like to sup.
1717,,
1718,,God rest her! she is still enough
1719,,Who sleeps beneath our feet!
1720,,The old man cried. No harm I trow
1721,,"She ever did herself, tho’ now"
1722,,She lies where four roads meet.
1723,,
1724,,I have past by about that hour
1725,,"When men are not most brave,"
1726,,"It did not make my heart to fail,"
1727,,And I have heard the nightingale
1728,,Sing sweetly on her grave.
1729,,
1730,,I have past by about that hour
1731,,"When Ghosts their freedom have,"
1732,,"But there was nothing here to fright,"
1733,,And I have seen the glow-worm’s light
1734,,Shine on the poor girl’s grave.
1735,,
1736,,There’s one who like a Christian lies
1737,,Beneath the church-tree’s shade;
1738,,I’d rather go a long mile round
1739,,Than pass at evening thro’ the ground
1740,,Wherein that man is laid.
1741,,
1742,,There’s one that in the church-yard lies
1743,,For whom the bell did toll;
1744,,"He lies in consecrated ground,"
1745,,But for all the wealth in Bristol town
1746,,I would not be with his soul!
1747,,
1748,,Did’st see a house below the hill
1749,,That the winds and the rains destroy?
1750,,"’Twas then a farm where he did dwell,"
1751,,And I remember it full well
1752,,When I was a growing boy.
1753,,
1754,,And she was a poor parish girl
1755,,"That came up from the west,"
1756,,From service hard she ran away
1757,,And at that house in evil day
1758,,Was taken in to rest.
1759,,
1760,,The man he was a wicked man
1761,,And an evil life he led;
1762,,Rage made his cheek grow deadly white
1763,,"And his grey eyes were large and light,"
1764,,And in anger they grew red.
1765,,
1766,,"The man was bad, the mother worse,"
1767,,"Bad fruit of a bad stem,"
1768,,’Twould make your hair to stand-on-end
1769,,If I should tell to you my friend
1770,,The things that were told of them!
1771,,
1772,,Did’st see an out-house standing by?
1773,,The walls alone remain;
1774,,"It was a stable then, but now"
1775,,Its mossy roof has fallen through
1776,,All rotted by the rain.
1777,,
1778,,The poor girl she had serv’d with them
1779,,"Some half-a-year, or more,"
1780,,When she was found hung up one day
1781,,Stiff as a corpse and cold as clay
1782,,Behind that stable door!
1783,,
1784,,"It is a very lonesome place,"
1785,,No hut or house is near;
1786,,Should one meet a murderer there alone
1787,,"’Twere vain to scream, and the dying groan"
1788,,Would never reach mortal ear.
1789,,
1790,,And there were strange reports about
1791,,That the coroner never guest.
1792,,So he decreed that she should lie
1793,,"Where four roads meet in infamy,"
1794,,With a stake drove in her breast.
1795,,
1796,,Upon a board they carried her
1797,,"To the place where four roads met,"
1798,,And I was one among the throng
1799,,"That hither followed them along,"
1800,,I shall never the sight forget!
1801,,
1802,,They carried her upon a board
1803,,In the cloaths in which she died;
1804,,"I saw the cap blow off her head,"
1805,,Her face was of a dark dark red
1806,,Her eyes were starting wide:
1807,,
1808,,I think they could not have been closed
1809,,So widely did they strain.
1810,,"I never saw so dreadful a sight,"
1811,,"And it often made me wake at night,"
1812,,For I saw her face again.
1813,,
1814,,They laid her here where four roads meet.
1815,,"Beneath this very place,"
1816,,"The earth upon her corpse was prest,"
1817,,"This post is driven into her breast,"
1818,,And a stone is on her face.

1823,,The Sailor
1824,,who had served in the Slave Trade
1825,,
1826,,
1827,,"In September, 1798, a Dissenting Minister of Bristol, discovered a"
1828,,"Sailor in the neighbourhood of that City, groaning and praying in a"
1829,,hovel. The circumstance that occasioned his agony of mind is detailed
1830,,"in the annexed Ballad, without the slightest addition or alteration. By"
1831,,"presenting it as a Poem the story is made more public, and such stories"
1832,,ought to be made as public as possible.
1833,,
1834,,"He stopt,—it surely was a groan"
1835,,That from the hovel came!
1836,,He stopt and listened anxiously
1837,,Again it sounds the same.
1838,,
1839,,It surely from the hovel comes!
1840,,"And now he hastens there,"
1841,,And thence he hears the name of Christ
1842,,Amidst a broken prayer.
1843,,
1844,,"He entered in the hovel now,"
1845,,"A sailor there he sees,"
1846,,His hands were lifted up to Heaven
1847,,And he was on his knees.
1848,,
1849,,Nor did the Sailor so intent
1850,,"His entering footsteps heed,"
1851,,"But now the Lord’s prayer said, and now"
1852,,His half-forgotten creed.
1853,,
1854,,And often on his Saviour call’d
1855,,"With many a bitter groan,"
1856,,In such heart-anguish as could spring
1857,,From deepest guilt alone.
1858,,
1859,,He ask’d the miserable man
1860,,"Why he was kneeling there,"
1861,,And what the crime had been that caus’d
1862,,The anguish of his prayer.
1863,,
1864,,Oh I have done a wicked thing!
1865,,"It haunts me night and day,"
1866,,And I have sought this lonely place
1867,,Here undisturb’d to pray.
1868,,
1869,,I have no place to pray on board
1870,,"So I came here alone,"
1871,,"That I might freely kneel and pray,"
1872,,And call on Christ and groan.
1873,,
1874,,"If to the main-mast head I go,"
1875,,"The wicked one is there,"
1876,,"From place to place, from rope to rope,"
1877,,He follows every where.
1878,,
1879,,"I shut my eyes,—it matters not—"
1880,,"Still still the same I see,—"
1881,,And when I lie me down at night
1882,,’Tis always day with me.
1883,,
1884,,"He follows follows every where,"
1885,,And every place is Hell!
1886,,O God—and I must go with him
1887,,In endless fire to dwell.
1888,,
1889,,"He follows follows every where,"
1890,,"He’s still above—below,"
1891,,Oh tell me where to fly from him!
1892,,Oh tell me where to go!
1893,,
1894,,"But tell me, quoth the Stranger then,"
1895,,"What this thy crime hath been,"
1896,,So haply I may comfort give
1897,,To one that grieves for sin.
1898,,
1899,,O I have done a cursed deed
1900,,"The wretched man replies,"
1901,,And night and day and every where
1902,,’Tis still before my eyes.
1903,,
1904,,I sail’d on board a Guinea-man
1905,,And to the slave-coast went;
1906,,Would that the sea had swallowed me
1907,,When I was innocent!
1908,,
1909,,"And we took in our cargo there,"
1910,,"Three hundred negroe slaves,"
1911,,And we sail’d homeward merrily
1912,,Over the ocean waves.
1913,,
1914,,But some were sulky of the slaves
1915,,"And would not touch their meat,"
1916,,So therefore we were forced by threats
1917,,And blows to make them eat.
1918,,
1919,,One woman sulkier than the rest
1920,,"Would still refuse her food,—"
1921,,O Jesus God! I hear her cries—
1922,,I see her in her blood!
1923,,
1924,,The Captain made me tie her up
1925,,"And flog while he stood by,"
1926,,And then he curs’d me if I staid
1927,,My hand to hear her cry.
1928,,
1929,,"She groan’d, she shriek’d—I could not spare"
1930,,For the Captain he stood by—
1931,,Dear God! that I might rest one night
1932,,From that poor woman’s cry!
1933,,
1934,,She twisted from the blows—her blood
1935,,Her mangled flesh I see—
1936,,And still the Captain would not spare—
1937,,Oh he was worse than me!
1938,,
1939,,She could not be more glad than I
1940,,"When she was taken down,"
1941,,A blessed minute—’twas the last
1942,,That I have ever known!
1943,,
1944,,"I did not close my eyes all night,"
1945,,Thinking what I had done;
1946,,I heard her groans and they grew faint
1947,,About the rising sun.
1948,,
1949,,"She groan’d and groan’d, but her groans grew"
1950,,"Fainter at morning tide,"
1951,,Fainter and fainter still they came
1952,,Till at the noon she died.
1953,,
1954,,They flung her overboard;—poor wretch
1955,,"She rested from her pain,—"
1956,,But when—O Christ! O blessed God!
1957,,Shall I have rest again!
1958,,
1959,,"I saw the sea close over her,"
1960,,Yet she was still in sight;
1961,,I see her twisting every where;
1962,,I see her day and night.
1963,,
1964,,"Go where I will, do what I can"
1965,,The wicked one I see—
1966,,"Dear Christ have mercy on my soul,"
1967,,O God deliver me!
1968,,
1969,,To morrow I set sail again
1970,,Not to the Negroe shore—
1971,,Wretch that I am I will at least
1972,,Commit that sin no more.
1973,,
1974,,O give me comfort if you can—
1975,,Oh tell me where to fly—
1976,,"And bid me hope, if there be hope,"
1977,,For one so lost as I.
1978,,
1979,,"Poor wretch, the stranger he replied,"
1980,,"Put thou thy trust in heaven,"
1981,,And call on him for whose dear sake
1982,,All sins shall be forgiven.
1983,,
1984,,"This night at least is thine, go thou"
1985,,"And seek the house of prayer,"
1986,,There shalt thou hear the word of God
1987,,And he will help thee there!

1995,,The stories of the two following ballads are wholly imaginary. I may
1996,,"say of each as John Bunyan did of his _Pilgrim’s Progress_,"
1997,,
1998,,"_It came from mine own heart, so to my head,"
1999,,And thence into my fingers trickled;
2000,,"Then to my pen, from whence immediately"
2001,,On paper I did dribble it daintily._

2005,,
2006,,Jaspar
2007,,
2008,,
2009,,"Jaspar was poor, and want and vice"
2010,,"Had made his heart like stone,"
2011,,And Jaspar look’d with envious eyes
2012,,On riches not his own.
2013,,
2014,,On plunder bent abroad he went
2015,,"Towards the close of day,"
2016,,And loitered on the lonely road
2017,,Impatient for his prey.
2018,,
2019,,"No traveller came, he loiter’d long"
2020,,"And often look’d around,"
2021,,And paus’d and listen’d eagerly
2022,,To catch some coming sound.
2023,,
2024,,He sat him down beside the stream
2025,,"That crossed the lonely way,"
2026,,So fair a scene might well have charm’d
2027,,All evil thoughts away;
2028,,
2029,,He sat beneath a willow tree
2030,,"That cast a trembling shade,"
2031,,The gentle river full in front
2032,,"A little island made,"
2033,,
2034,,Where pleasantly the moon-beam shone
2035,,"Upon the poplar trees,"
2036,,Whose shadow on the stream below
2037,,Play’d slowly to the breeze.
2038,,
2039,,He listen’d—and he heard the wind
2040,,That waved the willow tree;
2041,,He heard the waters flow along
2042,,And murmur quietly.
2043,,
2044,,"He listen’d for the traveller’s tread,"
2045,,"The nightingale sung sweet,—"
2046,,"He started up, for now he heard"
2047,,The sound of coming feet;
2048,,
2049,,He started up and graspt a stake
2050,,And waited for his prey;
2051,,There came a lonely traveller
2052,,And Jaspar crost his way.
2053,,
2054,,But Jaspar’s threats and curses fail’d
2055,,"The traveller to appal,"
2056,,He would not lightly yield the purse
2057,,That held his little all.
2058,,
2059,,"Awhile he struggled, but he strove"
2060,,With Jaspar’s strength in vain;
2061,,"Beneath his blows he fell and groan’d,"
2062,,And never spoke again.
2063,,
2064,,He lifted up the murdered man
2065,,"And plunged him in the flood,"
2066,,And in the running waters then
2067,,He cleansed his hands from blood.
2068,,
2069,,The waters closed around the corpse
2070,,"And cleansed his hands from gore,"
2071,,"The willow waved, the stream flowed on"
2072,,And murmured as before.
2073,,
2074,,There was no human eye had seen
2075,,"The blood the murderer spilt,"
2076,,And Jaspar’s conscience never knew
2077,,The avenging goad of guilt.
2078,,
2079,,And soon the ruffian had consum’d
2080,,"The gold he gain’d so ill,"
2081,,And years of secret guilt pass’d on
2082,,And he was needy still.
2083,,
2084,,One eve beside the alehouse fire
2085,,"He sat as it befell,"
2086,,When in there came a labouring man
2087,,Whom Jaspar knew full well.
2088,,
2089,,He sat him down by Jaspar’s side
2090,,"A melancholy man,"
2091,,"For spite of honest toil, the world"
2092,,Went hard with Jonathan.
2093,,
2094,,"His toil a little earn’d, and he"
2095,,"With little was content,"
2096,,But sickness on his wife had fallen
2097,,And all he had was spent.
2098,,
2099,,Then with his wife and little ones
2100,,"He shared the scanty meal,"
2101,,"And saw their looks of wretchedness,"
2102,,And felt what wretches feel.
2103,,
2104,,That very morn the Landlord’s power
2105,,"Had seized the little left,"
2106,,And now the sufferer found himself
2107,,Of every thing bereft.
2108,,
2109,,"He lent his head upon his hand,"
2110,,"His elbow on his knee,"
2111,,And so by Jaspar’s side he sat
2112,,And not a word said he.
2113,,
2114,,"Nay—why so downcast? Jaspar cried,"
2115,,Come—cheer up Jonathan!
2116,,"Drink neighbour drink! ’twill warm thy heart,"
2117,,Come! come! take courage man!
2118,,
2119,,He took the cup that Jaspar gave
2120,,And down he drain’d it *quic
2121,,"I have a wife, said Jonathan,"
2122,,And she is deadly sick.
2123,,
2124,,"She has no bed to lie upon,"
2125,,I saw them take her bed.
2126,,And I have children—would to God
2127,,That they and I were dead!
2128,,
2129,,Our Landlord he goes home to night
2130,,And he will sleep in peace.
2131,,I would that I were in my grave
2132,,For there all troubles cease.
2133,,
2134,,In vain I pray’d him to forbear
2135,,Tho’ wealth enough has he—
2136,,God be to him as merciless
2137,,As he has been to me!
2138,,
2139,,When Jaspar saw the poor man’s soul
2140,,"On all his ills intent,"
2141,,He plied him with the heartening cup
2142,,And with him forth he went.
2143,,
2144,,This landlord on his homeward road
2145,,’Twere easy now to meet.
2146,,"The road is lonesome—Jonathan,"
2147,,"And vengeance, man! is sweet."
2148,,
2149,,He listen’d to the tempter’s voice
2150,,The thought it made him start.
2151,,"His head was hot, and wretchedness"
2152,,Had hardened now his heart.
2153,,
2154,,Along the lonely road they went
2155,,"And waited for their prey,"
2156,,They sat them down beside the stream
2157,,That crossed the lonely way.
2158,,
2159,,They sat them down beside the stream
2160,,"And never a word they said,"
2161,,They sat and listen’d silently
2162,,To hear the traveller’s tread.
2163,,
2164,,"The night was calm, the night was dark,"
2165,,"No star was in the sky,"
2166,,"The wind it waved the willow boughs,"
2167,,The stream flowed quietly.
2168,,
2169,,"The night was calm, the air was still,"
2170,,"Sweet sung the nightingale,"
2171,,"The soul of Jonathan was sooth’d,"
2172,,His heart began to fail.
2173,,
2174,,"’Tis weary waiting here, he cried,"
2175,,"And now the hour is late,—"
2176,,"Methinks he will not come to night,"
2177,,’Tis useless more to wait.
2178,,
2179,,"Have patience man! the ruffian said,"
2180,,"A little we may wait,"
2181,,But longer shall his wife expect
2182,,Her husband at the gate.
2183,,
2184,,"Then Jonathan grew sick at heart,"
2185,,"My conscience yet is clear,"
2186,,Jaspar—it is not yet too late—
2187,,I will not linger here.
2188,,
2189,,"How now! cried Jaspar, why I thought"
2190,,Thy conscience was asleep.
2191,,"No more such qualms, the night is dark,"
2192,,"The river here is deep,"
2193,,
2194,,"What matters that, said Jonathan,"
2195,,"Whose blood began to freeze,"
2196,,When there is one above whose eye
2197,,The deeds of darkness sees?
2198,,
2199,,"We are safe enough, said Jaspar then"
2200,,If that be all thy fear;
2201,,"Nor eye below, nor eye above"
2202,,Can pierce the darkness here.
2203,,
2204,,That instant as the murderer spake
2205,,There came a sudden light;
2206,,"Strong as the mid-day sun it shone,"
2207,,Though all around was night.
2208,,
2209,,"It hung upon the willow tree,"
2210,,"It hung upon the flood,"
2211,,It gave to view the poplar isle
2212,,And all the scene of blood.
2213,,
2214,,The traveller who journies there
2215,,He surely has espied
2216,,A madman who has made his home
2217,,Upon the river’s side.
2218,,
2219,,"His cheek is pale, his eye is wild,"
2220,,His look bespeaks despair;
2221,,For Jaspar since that hour has made
2222,,His home unshelter’d there.
2223,,
2224,,And fearful are his dreams at night
2225,,And dread to him the day;
2226,,He thinks upon his untold crime
2227,,And never dares to pray.
2228,,
2229,,"The summer suns, the winter storms,"
2230,,"O’er him unheeded roll,"
2231,,For heavy is the weight of blood
2232,,Upon the maniac’s soul.
2233,,
2234,,
2235,,
2236,,
2237,,Lord William
2238,,
2239,,
2240,,No eye beheld when William plunged
2241,,"Young Edmund in the stream,"
2242,,No human ear but William’s heard
2243,,Young Edmund’s drowning scream.
2244,,
2245,,Submissive all the vassals own’d
2246,,"The murderer for their Lord,"
2247,,"And he, the rightful heir, possessed"
2248,,The house of Erlingford.
2249,,
2250,,The ancient house of Erlingford
2251,,"Stood midst a fair domain,"
2252,,And Severn’s ample waters near
2253,,Roll’d through the fertile plain.
2254,,
2255,,And often the way-faring man
2256,,"Would love to linger there,"
2257,,Forgetful of his onward road
2258,,To gaze on scenes so fair.
2259,,
2260,,But never could Lord William dare
2261,,To gaze on Severn’s stream;
2262,,In every wind that swept its waves
2263,,He heard young Edmund scream.
2264,,
2265,,In vain at midnight’s silent hour
2266,,"Sleep closed the murderer’s eyes,"
2267,,In every dream the murderer saw
2268,,Young Edmund’s form arise.
2269,,
2270,,In vain by restless conscience driven
2271,,"Lord William left his home,"
2272,,"Far from the scenes that saw his guilt,"
2273,,In pilgrimage to roam.
2274,,
2275,,"To other climes the pilgrim fled,"
2276,,"But could not fly despair,"
2277,,"He sought his home again, but peace"
2278,,Was still a stranger there.
2279,,
2280,,"Each hour was tedious long, yet swift"
2281,,The months appear’d to roll;
2282,,And now the day return’d that shook
2283,,With terror William’s soul.
2284,,
2285,,A day that William never felt
2286,,"Return without dismay,"
2287,,For well had conscience kalendered
2288,,Young Edmund’s dying day.
2289,,
2290,,A fearful day was that! the rains
2291,,"Fell fast, with tempest roar,"
2292,,And the swoln tide of Severn spread
2293,,Far on the level shore.
2294,,
2295,,In vain Lord William sought the feast
2296,,"In vain he quaff’d the bowl,"
2297,,And strove with noisy mirth to drown
2298,,The anguish of his soul.
2299,,
2300,,The tempest as its sudden swell
2301,,"In gusty howlings came,"
2302,,With cold and death-like feelings seem’d
2303,,To thrill his shuddering frame.
2304,,
2305,,"Reluctant now, as night came on,"
2306,,"His lonely couch he prest,"
2307,,"And wearied out, he sunk to sleep,"
2308,,"To sleep, but not to rest."
2309,,
2310,,Beside that couch his brother’s form
2311,,"Lord Edmund seem’d to stand,"
2312,,Such and so pale as when in death
2313,,He grasp’d his brother’s hand;
2314,,
2315,,Such and so pale his face as when
2316,,"With faint and faltering tongue,"
2317,,"To William’s care, a dying charge"
2318,,He left his orphan son.
2319,,
2320,,“I bade thee with a father’s love
2321,,My orphan Edmund guard—
2322,,Well William hast thou kept thy charge!
2323,,Now take thy due reward.”
2324,,
2325,,"He started up, each limb convuls’d"
2326,,"With agonizing fear,"
2327,,He only heard the storm of night—
2328,,’Twas music to his ear.
2329,,
2330,,When lo! the voice of loud alarm
2331,,"His inmost soul appals,"
2332,,What ho! Lord William rise in haste!
2333,,The water saps thy walls!
2334,,
2335,,"He rose in haste, beneath the walls"
2336,,"He saw the flood appear,"
2337,,"It hemm’d him round, ’twas midnight now,"
2338,,No human aid was near.
2339,,
2340,,"He heard the shout of joy, for now"
2341,,"A boat approach’d the wall,"
2342,,And eager to the welcome aid
2343,,They crowd for safety all.
2344,,
2345,,"My boat is small, the boatman cried,"
2346,,This dangerous haste forbear!
2347,,"Wait other aid, this little bark"
2348,,But one from hence can bear.
2349,,
2350,,"Lord William leap’d into the boat,"
2351,,Haste—haste to yonder shore!
2352,,"And ample wealth shall well reward,"
2353,,Ply swift and strong the oar.
2354,,
2355,,"The boatman plied the oar, the boat"
2356,,"Went light along the stream,"
2357,,Sudden Lord William heard a cry
2358,,Like Edmund’s drowning scream.
2359,,
2360,,"The boatman paus’d, methought I heard"
2361,,A child’s distressful cry!
2362,,’Twas but the howling wind of night
2363,,Lord William made reply.
2364,,
2365,,Haste haste—ply swift and strong the oar!
2366,,Haste haste across the stream!
2367,,Again Lord William heard a cry
2368,,Like Edmund’s drowning scream.
2369,,
2370,,I heard a child’s distressful scream
2371,,The boatman cried again.
2372,,Nay hasten on—the night is dark—
2373,,And we should search in vain.
2374,,
2375,,Oh God! Lord William dost thou know
2376,,How dreadful ’tis to die?
2377,,And can’st thou without pity hear
2378,,A child’s expiring cry?
2379,,
2380,,How horrible it is to sink
2381,,"Beneath the chilly stream,"
2382,,"To stretch the powerless arms in vain,"
2383,,In vain for help to scream?
2384,,
2385,,The shriek again was heard. It came
2386,,"More deep, more piercing loud,"
2387,,That instant o’er the flood the moon
2388,,Shone through a broken cloud.
2389,,
2390,,"And near them they beheld a child,"
2391,,"Upon a crag he stood,"
2392,,"A little crag, and all around"
2393,,Was spread the rising flood.
2394,,
2395,,"The boatman plied the oar, the boat"
2396,,"Approach’d his resting place,"
2397,,The moon-beam shone upon the child
2398,,And show’d how pale his face.
2399,,
2400,,Now reach thine hand! the boatman cried
2401,,Lord William reach and save!
2402,,The child stretch’d forth his little hands
2403,,To grasp the hand he gave.
2404,,
2405,,Then William shriek’d; the hand he touch’d
2406,,Was cold and damp and dead!
2407,,He felt young Edmund in his arms
2408,,A heavier weight than lead.
2409,,
2410,,"The boat sunk down, the murderer sunk"
2411,,Beneath the avenging stream;
2412,,"He rose, he scream’d, no human ear"
2413,,Heard William’s drowning scream.

2574,,"And her eyes grew deadly dim,"
2575,,Short came her breath and the struggle of death

2578,,They blest the old woman’s winding sheet
2579,,"With rites and prayers as due,"

2583,,And they chain’d her in her coffin of stone

2586,,They chain’d it to the ground.
2587,,
2588,,"And they blest the chains and sprinkled them,"
2589,,"And fifty priests stood round,"

2591,,Where she lay on the ground.
2592,,
2593,,And fifty choristers were there
2594,,"To sing the funeral song,"
2595,,And a hallowed taper blazed in the hand
2596,,Of all the sacred throng.
2597,,
2598,,To see the priests and choristers
2599,,"It was a goodly sight,"
2600,,"Each holding, as it were a staff,"
2601,,A taper burning bright.
2602,,
2603,,And the church bells all both great and small
2604,,"Did toll so loud and long,"
2605,,And they have barr’d the church door hard
2606,,After the even song.
2607,,
2608,,And the first night the taper’s light
2609,,Burnt steadily and clear.
2610,,But they without a hideous rout
2611,,Of angry fiends could hear;
2612,,
2613,,A hideous roar at the church door
2614,,"Like a long thunder peal,"
2615,,And the priests they pray’d and the choristers sung
2616,,Louder in fearful zeal.
2617,,
2618,,"Loud toll’d the bell, the priests pray’d well,"
2619,,"The tapers they burnt bright,"
2620,,"The monk her son, and her daughter the nun"
2621,,They told their beads all night.
2622,,
2623,,"The cock he crew, away they flew"
2624,,"The fiends from the herald of day,"
2625,,And undisturb’d the choristers sing
2626,,And the fifty priests they pray.
2627,,
2628,,The second night the taper’s light
2629,,"Burnt dismally and blue,"
2630,,And every one saw his neighbour’s face
2631,,Like a dead man’s face to view.
2632,,
2633,,And yells and cries without arise
2634,,"That the stoutest heart might shock,"
2635,,And a deafening roaring like a cataract pouring
2636,,Over a mountain rock.
2637,,
2638,,The monk and nun they told their beads
2639,,"As fast as they could tell,"
2640,,And aye as louder grew the noise
2641,,The faster went the bell.
2642,,
2643,,Louder and louder the choristers sung
2644,,"As they trembled more and more,"
2645,,"And the fifty priests prayed to heaven for aid,"
2646,,They never had prayed so before.
2647,,
2648,,"The cock he crew, away they flew"
2649,,"The fiends from the herald of day,"
2650,,And undisturb’d the choristers sing
2651,,And the fifty priests they pray.
2652,,
2653,,The third night came and the tapers flame
2654,,"A hideous stench did make,"
2655,,And they burnt as though they had been dipt
2656,,In the burning brimstone lake.
2657,,
2658,,"And the loud commotion, like the rushing of ocean,"
2659,,"Grew momently more and more,"
2660,,And strokes as of a battering ram
2661,,Did shake the strong church door.
2662,,
2663,,The bellmen they for very fear
2664,,"Could toll the bell no longer,"
2665,,And still as louder grew the strokes
2666,,Their fear it grew the stronger.
2667,,
2668,,"The monk and nun forgot their beads,"
2669,,"They fell on the ground dismay’d,"
2670,,There was not a single saint in heaven
2671,,Whom they did not call to aid.
2672,,
2673,,And the choristers song that late was so strong
2674,,"Grew a quaver of consternation,"
2675,,For the church did rock as an earthquake shock
2676,,Uplifted its foundation.
2677,,
2678,,And a sound was heard like the trumpet’s blast
2679,,"That shall one day wake the dead,"
2680,,The strong church door could bear no more
2681,,And the bolts and the bars they fled.
2682,,
2683,,"And the taper’s light was extinguish’d quite,"
2684,,"And the choristers faintly sung,"
2685,,"And the priests dismay’d, panted and prayed"
2686,,Till fear froze every tongue.
2687,,
2688,,And in He came with eyes of flame
2689,,"The Fiend to fetch the dead,"
2690,,And all the church with his presence glowed
2691,,Like a fiery furnace red.
2692,,
2693,,He laid his hand on the iron chains
2694,,"And like flax they moulder’d asunder,"
2695,,And the coffin lid that was barr’d so firm
2696,,He burst with his voice of thunder.
2697,,
2698,,And he bade the Old Woman of Berkeley rise
2699,,"And come with her master away,"
2700,,"And the cold sweat stood on the cold cold corpse,"
2701,,At the voice she was forced to obey.
2702,,
2703,,"She rose on her feet in her winding sheet,"
2704,,"Her dead flesh quivered with fear,"
2705,,And a groan like that which the Old Woman gave
2706,,Never did mortal hear.
2707,,
2708,,"She followed the fiend to the church door,"
2709,,"There stood a black horse there,"
2710,,"His breath was red like furnace smoke,"
2711,,His eyes like a meteor’s glare.
2712,,
2713,,The fiendish force flung her on the horse
2714,,"And he leapt up before,"
2715,,And away like the lightning’s speed they went
2716,,And she was seen no more.
2717,,
2718,,"They saw her no more, but her cries and shrieks"
2719,,"For four miles round they could hear,"
2720,,"And children at rest at their mother’s breast,"
2721,,Started and screamed with fear.

2732,,"Respecting the patent coffins herein mentioned, after the manner of"

2739,,
2740,,The Doctor whispered to the Nurse
2741,,"And the Surgeon knew what he said,"
2742,,And he grew pale at the Doctor’s tale
2743,,And trembled in his sick bed.
2744,,
2745,,Now fetch me my brethren and fetch them with speed
2746,,"The Surgeon affrighted said,"
2747,,"The Parson and the Undertaker,"
2748,,Let them hasten or I shall be dead.
2749,,
2750,,The Parson and the Undertaker
2751,,"They hastily came complying,"
2752,,And the Surgeon’s Prentices ran up stairs
2753,,When they heard that their master was dying.

2756,,"By one, by two, by three,"
2757,,"With a sly grin came Joseph in,"
2758,,First of the company.
2759,,
2760,,"The Surgeon swore as they enter’d his door,"
2761,,"’Twas fearful his oaths to hear,—"
2762,,"Now send these scoundrels to the Devil,"
2763,,For God’s sake my brethren dear.
2764,,
2765,,He foam’d at the mouth with the rage he felt
2766,,"And he wrinkled his black eye-brow,"
2767,,"That rascal Joe would be at me I know,"
2768,,But zounds let him spare me now.
2769,,
2770,,"Then out they sent the Prentices,"
2771,,"The fit it left him weak,"
2772,,"He look’d at his brothers with ghastly eyes,"
2773,,And faintly struggled to speak.
2774,,
2775,,"All kinds of carcasses I have cut up,"
2776,,And the judgment now must be—
2777,,"But brothers I took care of you,"
2778,,So pray take care of me!
2779,,
2780,,I have made candles of infants fat
2781,,"The Sextons have been my slaves,"
2782,,"I have bottled babes unborn, and dried"
2783,,Hearts and livers from rifled graves.
2784,,
2785,,And my Prentices now will surely come
2786,,"And carve me bone from bone,"
2787,,And I who have rifled the dead man’s grave
2788,,Shall never have rest in my own.
2789,,
2790,,"Bury me in lead when I am dead,"
2791,,"My brethren I intreat,"
2792,,And see the coffin weigh’d I beg
2793,,Lest the Plumber should be a cheat.
2794,,
2795,,And let it be solder’d closely down
2796,,"Strong as strong can be I implore,"
2797,,"And put it in a patent coffin,"
2798,,That I may rise no more.
2799,,
2800,,If they carry me off in the patent coffin
2801,,"Their labour will be in vain,"
2802,,Let the Undertaker see it bought of the maker
2803,,Who lives by St. Martin’s lane.
2804,,
2805,,And bury me in my brother’s church
2806,,"For that will safer be,"
2807,,And I implore lock the church door
2808,,And pray take care of the key.
2809,,
2810,,And all night long let three stout men
2811,,"The vestry watch within,"
2812,,To each man give a gallon of beer
2813,,And a keg of Holland’s gin;
2814,,
2815,,Powder and ball and blunder-buss
2816,,"To save me if he can,"
2817,,And eke five guineas if he shoot
2818,,A resurrection man.
2819,,
2820,,And let them watch me for three weeks
2821,,"My wretched corpse to save,"
2822,,For then I think that I may stink
2823,,Enough to rest in my grave.
2824,,
2825,,"The Surgeon laid him down in his bed,"
2826,,"His eyes grew deadly dim,"
2827,,Short came his breath and the struggle of death
2828,,Distorted every limb.
2829,,
2830,,They put him in lead when he was dead
2831,,"And shrouded up so neat,"
2832,,And they the leaden coffin weigh
2833,,Lest the Plumber should be a cheat.
2834,,
2835,,They had it solder’d closely down
2836,,"And examined it o’er and o’er,"
2837,,And they put it in a patent coffin
2838,,That he might rise no more.
2839,,
2840,,For to carry him off in a patent coffin
2841,,"Would they thought be but labour in vain,"
2842,,So the Undertaker saw it bought of the maker
2843,,Who lives by St. Martin’s lane.
2844,,
2845,,In his brother’s church they buried him
2846,,"That safer he might be,"
2847,,They lock’d the door and would not trust
2848,,The Sexton with the key.
2849,,
2850,,And three men in the vestry watch
2851,,"To save him if they can,"
2852,,And should he come there to shoot they swear
2853,,A resurrection man.
2854,,
2855,,And the first night by lanthorn light
2856,,"Thro’ the church-yard as they went,"
2857,,A guinea of gold the sexton shewed
2858,,That Mister Joseph sent.
2859,,
2860,,"But conscience was tough, it was not enough"
2861,,"And their honesty never swerved,"
2862,,And they bade him go with Mister Joe
2863,,To the Devil as he deserved.
2864,,
2865,,So all night long by the vestry fire
2866,,"They quaff’d their gin and ale,"
2867,,And they did drink as you may think
2868,,And told full many a tale.
2869,,
2870,,The second night by lanthorn light
2871,,"Thro’ the church-yard as they went,"
2872,,He whisper’d anew and shew’d them two
2873,,That Mister Joseph sent.
2874,,
2875,,The guineas were bright and attracted their sight
2876,,"They look’d so heavy and new,"
2877,,And their fingers itch’d as they were bewitch’d
2878,,And they knew not what to do.
2879,,
2880,,But they waver’d not long for conscience was strong
2881,,"And they thought they might get more,"
2882,,"And they refused the gold, but not"
2883,,So rudely as before.
2884,,
2885,,So all night long by the vestry fire
2886,,"They quaff’d their gin and ale,"
2887,,And they did drink as you may think
2888,,And told full many a tale.
2889,,
2890,,The third night as by lanthorn light
2891,,"Thro’ the church-yard they went,"
2892,,He bade them see and shew’d them three
2893,,That Mister Joseph sent.
2894,,
2895,,"They look’d askance with eager glance,"
2896,,"The guineas they shone bright,"
2897,,For the Sexton on the yellow gold
2898,,Let fall his lanthorn light.
2899,,
2900,,And he look’d sly with his roguish eye
2901,,"And gave a well-tim’d wink,"
2902,,And they could not stand the sound in his hand
2903,,For he made the guineas chink.
2904,,
2905,,"And conscience late that had such weight,"
2906,,"All in a moment fails,"
2907,,For well they knew that it was true
2908,,"A dead man told no tales,"
2909,,
2910,,And they gave all their powder and ball
2911,,"And took the gold so bright,"
2912,,"And they drank their beer and made good cheer,"
2913,,Till now it was midnight.
2914,,
2915,,"Then, tho’ the key of the church door"
2916,,"Was left with the Parson his brother,"
2917,,It opened at the Sexton’s touch—
2918,,Because he had another.
2919,,
2920,,And in they go with that villain Joe
2921,,"To fetch the body by night,"
2922,,And all the church look’d dismally
2923,,By his dark lanthorn light.
2924,,
2925,,They laid the pick-axe to the stones
2926,,And they moved them soon asunder.
2927,,They shovell’d away the hard-prest clay
2928,,And came to the coffin under.
2929,,
2930,,They burst the patent coffin first
2931,,"And they cut thro’ the lead,"
2932,,And they laugh’d aloud when they saw the shroud
2933,,Because they had got at the dead.
2934,,
2935,,And they allowed the Sexton the shroud
2936,,"And they put the coffin back,"
2937,,And nose and knees they then did squeeze
2938,,The Surgeon in a sack.
2939,,
2940,,The watchmen as they past along
2941,,"Full four yards off could smell,"
2942,,And a curse bestowed upon the load
2943,,So disagreeable.
2944,,
2945,,So they carried the sack a-pick-a-back
2946,,"And they carv’d him bone from bone,"
2947,,But what became of the Surgeon’s soul
2948,,Was never to mortal known.
2949,,
2950,,
2951,,
2952,,
2953,,The Victory
2954,,
2955,,
2956,,Hark—how the church-bells thundering harmony
2957,,"Stuns the glad ear! tidings of joy have come,"
2958,,Good tidings of great joy! two gallant ships
2959,,"Met on the element,—they met, they fought"
2960,,A desperate fight!—good tidings of great joy!
2961,,Old England triumphed! yet another day
2962,,Of glory for the ruler of the waves!
2963,,"For those who fell, ’twas in their country’s cause,"
2964,,They have their passing paragraphs of praise
2965,,And are forgotten.
2966,,There was one who died
2967,,"In that day’s glory, whose obscurer name"
2968,,No proud historian’s page will chronicle.
2969,,"Peace to his honest soul! I read his name,"
2970,,"’Twas in the list of slaughter, and blest God"
2971,,The sound was not familiar to mine ear.
2972,,But it was told me after that this man
2973,,Was one whom lawful violence[10] had forced
2974,,"From his own home and wife and little ones,"
2975,,Who by his labour lived; that he was one
2976,,Whose uncorrupted heart could keenly feel
2977,,"A husband’s love, a father’s anxiousness,"
2978,,That from the wages of his toil he fed
2979,,"The distant dear ones, and would talk of them"
2980,,At midnight when he trod the silent deck
2981,,"With him he valued, talk of them, of joys"
2982,,That he had known—oh God! and of the hour
2983,,"When they should meet again, till his full heart"
2984,,His manly heart at last would overflow
2985,,Even like a child’s with very tenderness.
2986,,Peace to his honest spirit! suddenly
2987,,"It came, and merciful the ball of death,"
2988,,"For it came suddenly and shattered him,"
2989,,And left no moment’s agonizing thought
2990,,On those he loved so well.
2991,,He ocean deep
2992,,Now lies at rest. Be Thou her comforter
2993,,Who art the widow’s friend! Man does not know
2994,,What a cold sickness made her blood run back
2995,,When first she heard the tidings of the fight;
2996,,Man does not know with what a dreadful hope
2997,,"She listened to the names of those who died,"
2998,,"Man does not know, or knowing will not heed,"
2999,,With what an agony of tenderness
3000,,"She gazed upon her children, and beheld"
3001,,His image who was gone. Oh God! be thou
3002,,Her comforter who art the widow’s friend!

3013,,"It was a little island where he dwelt,"
3014,,"Or rather a lone rock, barren and bleak,"
3015,,Short scanty herbage spotting with dark spots
3016,,Its gray stone surface. Never mariner
3017,,"Approach’d that rude and uninviting coast,"
3018,,Nor ever fisherman his lonely bark
3019,,Anchored beside its shore. It was a place
3020,,"Befitting well a rigid anchoret,"
3021,,"Dead to the hopes, and vanities, and joys"
3022,,And purposes of life; and he had dwelt
3023,,"Many long years upon that lonely isle,"
3024,,"For in ripe manhood he abandoned arms,"
3025,,"Honours and friends and country and the world,"
3026,,And had grown old in solitude. That isle
3027,,Some solitary man in other times
3028,,Had made his dwelling-place; and Henry found
3029,,The little chapel that his toil had built
3030,,"Now by the storms unroofed, his bed of leaves"
3031,,"Wind-scattered, and his grave o’ergrown with grass,"
3032,,"And thistles, whose white seeds winged in vain"
3033,,"Withered on rocks, or in the waves were lost."
3034,,"So he repaired the chapel’s ruined roof,"
3035,,"Clear’d the grey lichens from the altar-stone,"
3036,,And underneath a rock that shelter’d him
3037,,"From the sea blasts, he built his hermitage."
3038,,
3039,,The peasants from the shore would bring him food
3040,,And beg his prayers; but human converse else
3041,,"He knew not in that utter solitude,"
3042,,Nor ever visited the haunts of men
3043,,Save when some sinful wretch on a sick bed
3044,,Implored his blessing and his aid in death.
3045,,"That summons he delayed not to obey,"
3046,,Tho’ the night tempest or autumnal wind.
3047,,"Maddened the waves, and tho’ the mariner,"
3048,,"Albeit relying on his saintly load,"
3049,,Grew pale to see the peril. So he lived
3050,,"A most austere and self-denying man,"
3051,,"Till abstinence, and age, and watchfulness"
3052,,"Exhausted him, and it was pain at last"
3053,,To rise at midnight from his bed of leaves
3054,,And bend his knees in prayer. Yet not the less
3055,,"Tho’ with reluctance of infirmity,"
3056,,He rose at midnight from his bed of leaves
3057,,And bent his knees in prayer; but with more zeal
3058,,More self-condemning fervour rais’d his voice
3059,,"For pardon for that sin, till that the sin"
3060,,Repented was a joy like a good deed.
3061,,
3062,,One night upon the shore his chapel bell
3063,,"Was heard; the air was calm, and its far sounds"
3064,,Over the water came distinct and loud.
3065,,Alarmed at that unusual hour to hear
3066,,"Its toll irregular, a monk arose."
3067,,The boatmen bore him willingly across
3068,,For well the hermit Henry was beloved.
3069,,"He hastened to the chapel, on a stone"
3070,,"Henry was sitting there, cold, stiff and dead,"
3071,,"The bell-rope in his band, and at his feet"
3072,,The lamp[11] that stream’d a long unsteady light
3073,,
3074,,"[11] This story is related in the English Martyrology, 1608."

3079,,English Eclogues
3080,,
3081,,
3082,,"The following Eclogues I believe, bear no resemblance to any poems in"
3083,,our language. This species of composition has become popular in
3084,,"Germany, and I was induced to attempt by an account of the German"
3085,,Idylls given me in conversation. They cannot properly be stiled
3086,,"imitations, as I am ignorant of that language at present, and have"
3087,,never seen any translations or specimens in this kind.
3088,,
3089,,"With bad Eclogues I am sufficiently acquainted, from Tityrus and"
3090,,Corydon down to our English Strephons and Thirsises. No kind of poetry
3091,,can boast of more illustrious names or is more distinguished by the
3092,,servile dulness of imitated nonsense. Pastoral writers “more silly than
3093,,their sheep” have like their sheep gone on in the same track one after
3094,,another. Gay stumbled into a new path. His eclogues were the only ones
3095,,"that interested me when I was a boy, and did not know they were"
3096,,"burlesque. The subject would furnish matter for a long essay, but this"
3097,,is not the place for it.
3098,,
3099,,How far poems requiring almost a colloquial plainness of language may
3100,,accord with the public taste I am doubtful. They have been subjected to
3101,,able criticism and revised with care. I have endeavoured to make them
3102,,true to nature.

3107,,Eclogue I ­ The Old Mansion House
3108,,
3109,,
3110,,_Stranger_.
3111,,"Old friend! why you seem bent on parish duty,"
3112,,"Breaking the highway stones,—and ’tis a task"
3113,,Somewhat too hard methinks for age like yours.
3114,,
3115,,_Old Man_.
3116,,Why yes! for one with such a weight of years
3117,,"Upon his back. I’ve lived here, man and boy,"
3118,,"In this same parish, near the age of man"
3119,,For I am hard upon threescore and ten.
3120,,I can remember sixty years ago
3121,,The beautifying of this mansion here
3122,,"When my late Lady’s father, the old Squire"
3123,,Came to the estate.
3124,,
3125,,_Stranger_.
3126,,Why then you have outlasted
3127,,"All his improvements, for you see they’re making"
3128,,Great alterations here.
3129,,
3130,,_Old Man_.
3131,,Aye-great indeed!
3132,,And if my poor old Lady could rise up—
3133,,God rest her soul! ’twould grieve her to behold
3134,,The wicked work is here.
3135,,
3136,,_Stranger_.
3137,,They’ve set about it
3138,,"In right good earnest. All the front is gone,"
3139,,"Here’s to be turf they tell me, and a road"
3140,,Round to the door. There were some yew trees too
3141,,Stood in the court.
3142,,
3143,,_Old Man_.
3144,,Aye Master! fine old trees!
3145,,My grandfather could just remember back
3146,,When they were planted there. It was my task
3147,,"To keep them trimm’d, and ’twas a pleasure to me!"
3148,,"All strait and smooth, and like a great green wall!"
3149,,My poor old Lady many a time would come
3150,,"And tell me where to shear, for she had played"
3151,,"In childhood under them, and ’twas her pride"
3152,,To keep them in their beauty. Plague I say
3153,,On their new-fangled whimsies! we shall have
3154,,A modern shrubbery here stuck full of firs
3155,,And your pert poplar trees;—I could as soon
3156,,Have plough’d my father’s grave as cut them down!
3157,,
3158,,_Stranger_.
3159,,"But ’twill be lighter and more chearful now,"
3160,,"A fine smooth turf, and with a gravel road"
3161,,"Round for the carriage,—now it suits my taste."
3162,,"I like a shrubbery too, it looks so fresh,"
3163,,And then there’s some variety about it.
3164,,"In spring the lilac and the gueldres rose,"
3165,,And the laburnum with its golden flowers
3166,,Waving in the wind. And when the autumn comes
3167,,"The bright red berries of the mountain ash,"
3168,,"With firs enough in winter to look green,"
3169,,And show that something lives. Sure this is better
3170,,Than a great hedge of yew that makes it look
3171,,"All the year round like winter, and for ever"
3172,,Dropping its poisonous leaves from the under boughs
3173,,So dry and bare!
3174,,
3175,,_Old Man_.
3176,,Ah! so the new Squire thinks
3177,,And pretty work he makes of it! what ’tis
3178,,To have a stranger come to an old house!
3179,,
3180,,_Stranger_.
3181,,It seems you know him not?
3182,,
3183,,_Old Man_.
3184,,"No Sir, not I."
3185,,"They tell me he’s expected daily now,"
3186,,But in my Lady’s time he never came
3187,,"But once, for they were very distant kin."
3188,,If he had played about here when a child
3189,,"In that fore court, and eat the yew-berries,"
3190,,"And sat in the porch threading the jessamine flowers,"
3191,,"That fell so thick, he had not had the heart"
3192,,To mar all thus.
3193,,
3194,,_Stranger_.
3195,,Come—come! all a not wrong.
3196,,Those old dark windows—
3197,,
3198,,_Old Man_.
3199,,They’re demolish’d too—
3200,,As if he could not see thro’ casement glass!
3201,,The very red-breasts that so regular
3202,,"Came to my Lady for her morning crumbs,"
3203,,Won’t know the window now!
3204,,
3205,,_Stranger_.
3206,,Nay they were high
3207,,"And then so darken’d up with jessamine,"
3208,,Harbouring the vermine;—that was a fine tree
3209,,However. Did it not grow in and line
3210,,The porch?
3211,,
3212,,_Old Man_.
3213,,All over it: it did one good
3214,,To pass within ten yards when ’twas in blossom.
3215,,There was a sweet-briar too that grew beside.
3216,,My Lady loved at evening to sit there
3217,,And knit; and her old dog lay at her feet
3218,,And slept in the sun; ’twas an old favourite dog
3219,,She did not love him less that he was old
3220,,"And feeble, and he always had a place"
3221,,"By the fire-side, and when he died at last"
3222,,She made me dig a grave in the garden for him.
3223,,Ah I she was good to all! a woful day
3224,,’Twas for the poor when to her grave she went!
3225,,
3226,,_Stranger_.
3227,,They lost a friend then?
3228,,
3229,,_Old Man_.
3230,,You’re a stranger here
3231,,Or would not ask that question. Were they sick?
3232,,"She had rare cordial waters, and for herbs"
3233,,She could have taught the Doctors. Then at winter
3234,,When weekly she distributed the bread
3235,,"In the poor old porch, to see her and to hear"
3236,,The blessings on her! and I warrant them
3237,,They were a blessing to her when her wealth
3238,,"Had been no comfort else. At Christmas, Sir!"
3239,,It would have warm’d your heart if you had seen
3240,,"Her Christmas kitchen,—how the blazing fire"
3241,,"Made her fine pewter shine, and holly boughs"
3242,,"So chearful red,—and as for misseltoe,"
3243,,The finest bough that grew in the country round
3244,,Was mark’d for Madam. Then her old ale went
3245,,"So bountiful about! a Christmas cask,"
3246,,And ’twas a noble one! God help me Sir!
3247,,But I shall never see such days again.
3248,,
3249,,_Stranger_.
3250,,Things may be better yet than you suppose
3251,,And you should hope the best.
3252,,
3253,,_Old Man_.
3254,,It don’t look well
3255,,These alterations Sir! I’m an old man
3256,,And love the good old fashions; we don’t find
3257,,Old bounty in new houses. They’ve destroyed
3258,,All that my Lady loved; her favourite walk
3259,,"Grubb’d up, and they do say that the great row"
3260,,"Of elms behind the house, that meet a-top"
3261,,They must fall too. Well! well! I did not think
3262,,"To live to see all this, and ’tis perhaps"
3263,,A comfort I shan’t live to see it long.
3264,,
3265,,_Stranger_.
3266,,But sure all changes are not needs for the worse
3267,,My friend.
3268,,
3269,,_Old Man_.
3270,,May-hap they mayn’t Sir;—for all that
3271,,I like what I’ve been us’d to. I remember
3272,,"All this from a child up, and now to lose it,"
3273,,’Tis losing an old friend. There’s nothing left
3274,,As ’twas;—I go abroad and only meet
3275,,With men whose fathers I remember boys;
3276,,The brook that used to run before my door
3277,,That’s gone to the great pond; the trees I learnt
3278,,To climb are down; and I see nothing now
3279,,"That tells me of old times, except the stones"
3280,,In the church-yard. You are young Sir and I hope
3281,,"Have many years in store,—but pray to God"
3282,,You mayn’t be left the last of all your friends.
3283,,
3284,,_Stranger_.
3285,,Well! well! you’ve one friend more than you’re aware of.
3286,,"If the Squire’s taste don’t suit with your’s, I warrant"
3287,,That’s all you’ll quarrel with: walk in and taste
3288,,"His beer, old friend! and see if your old Lady"
3289,,"E’er broached a better cask. You did not know me,"
3290,,But we’re acquainted now. ’Twould not be easy
3291,,To make you like the outside; but within—
3292,,That is not changed my friend! you’ll always find
3293,,The same old bounty and old welcome there.

3307,,Aye—dear Grandmamma!
3308,,A pretty story! something dismal now;
3309,,A bloody murder.

3312,,Or about a ghost.
3313,,
3314,,_Grandmother_.
3315,,"Nay, nay, I should but frighten you. You know"
3316,,The other night when I was telling you
3317,,"About the light in the church-yard, how you trembled"
3318,,"Because the screech-owl hooted at the window,"
3319,,And would not go to bed.
3320,,
3321,,_Jane_.
3322,,Why Grandmamma
3323,,You said yourself you did not like to hear him.
3324,,Pray now! we wo’nt be frightened.

3326,,_Grandmother_.
3327,,"Well, well, children!"
3328,,"But you’ve heard all my stories. Let me see,—"
3329,,Did I never tell you how the smuggler murdered

3331,,
3332,,_Harry_.
3333,,No—never! never!
3334,,
3335,,_Grandmother_.
3336,,Not how he cut her head off in the stable?
3337,,
3338,,_Harry_.
3339,,Oh—now! do tell us that!
3340,,
3341,,_Grandmother_.
3342,,You must have heard
3343,,"Your Mother, children! often tell of her."
3344,,"She used to weed in the garden here, and worm"
3345,,"Your uncle’s dogs,[12] and serve the house with coal;"
3346,,And glad enough she was in winter time
3347,,To drive her asses here! it was cold work
3348,,"To follow the slow beasts thro’ sleet and snow,"
3349,,And here she found a comfortable meal
3350,,"And a brave fire to thaw her, for poor Moll"
3351,,Was always welcome.
3352,,
3353,,_Harry_.
3354,,Oh—’twas blear-eyed Moll
3355,,"The collier woman,—a great ugly woman,"
3356,,I’ve heard of her.
3357,,
3358,,_Grandmother_.
3359,,Ugly enough poor soul!
3360,,At ten yards distance you could hardly tell
3361,,"If it were man or woman, for her voice"
3362,,"Was rough as our old mastiff’s, and she wore"
3363,,"A man’s old coat and hat,—and then her face!"
3364,,"There was a merry story told of her,"
3365,,How when the press-gang came to take her husband
3366,,"As they were both in bed, she heard them coming,"
3367,,"Drest John up in her night-cap, and herself"
3368,,Put on his clothes and went before the Captain.
3369,,
3370,,_Jane_.
3371,,And so they prest a woman!
3372,,
3373,,_Grandmother_.
3374,,’Twas a trick
3375,,"She dearly loved to tell, and all the country"
3376,,"Soon knew the jest, for she was used to travel"
3377,,For miles around. All weathers and all hours
3378,,"She crossed the hill, as hardy as her beasts,"
3379,,"Bearing the wind and rain and winter frosts,"
3380,,And if she did not reach her home at night
3381,,She laid her down in the stable with her asses
3382,,And slept as sound as they did.
3383,,
3384,,_Harry_.
3385,,With her asses!
3386,,
3387,,_Grandmother_.
3388,,"Yes, and she loved her beasts. For tho’ poor wretch"
3389,,She was a terrible reprobate and swore
3390,,"Like any trooper, she was always good"
3391,,"To the dumb creatures, never loaded them"
3392,,"Beyond their strength, and rather I believe"
3393,,"Would stint herself than let the poor beasts want,"
3394,,"Because, she said, they could not ask for food."
3395,,I never saw her stick fall heavier on them
3396,,Than just with its own weight. She little thought
3397,,This tender-heartedness would be her death!
3398,,"There was a fellow who had oftentimes,"
3399,,As if he took delight in cruelty.
3400,,Ill-used her Asses. He was one who lived
3401,,"By smuggling, and, for she had often met him"
3402,,"Crossing the down at night, she threatened him,"
3403,,"If he tormented them again, to inform"
3404,,Of his unlawful ways. Well—so it was—
3405,,"’Twas what they both were born to, he provoked her,"
3406,,"She laid an information, and one morn"
3407,,"They found her in the stable, her throat cut"
3408,,"From ear to ear, till the head only hung"
3409,,Just by a bit of skin.
3410,,
3411,,_Jane_.

3416,,
3417,,_Grandmother_.
3418,,They took him up;
3419,,"There was no proof, no one had seen the deed,"
3420,,And he was set at liberty. But God
3421,,"Whoss eye beholdeth all things, he had seen"
3422,,"The murder, and the murderer knew that God"
3423,,"Was witness to his crime. He fled the place,"
3424,,But nowhere could he fly the avenging hand
3425,,"Of heaven, but nowhere could the murderer rest,"
3426,,"A guilty conscience haunted him, by day,"
3427,,"By night, in company, in solitude,"
3428,,"Restless and wretched, did he bear upon him"
3429,,"The weight of blood; her cries were in his ears,"
3430,,Her stifled groans as when he knelt upon her
3431,,Always he heard; always he saw her stand
3432,,Before his eyes; even in the dead of night
3433,,"Distinctly seen as tho’ in the broad sun,"
3434,,She stood beside the murderer’s bed and yawn’d
3435,,Her ghastly wound; till life itself became
3436,,"A punishment at last he could not bear,"
3437,,"And he confess’d[13] it all, and gave himself"
3438,,"To death, so terrible, he said, it was"
3439,,To have a guilty conscience!
3440,,
3441,,_Harry_.
3442,,Was he hung then?
3443,,
3444,,_Grandmother_.
3445,,"Hung and anatomized. Poor wretched man,"
3446,,"Your uncles went to see him on his trial,"
3447,,"He was so pale, so thin, so hollow-eyed,"
3448,,"And such a horror in his meagre face,"
3449,,They said he look’d like one who never slept.
3450,,He begg’d the prayers of all who saw his end
3451,,And met his death with fears that well might warn
3452,,"From guilt, tho’ not without a hope in Christ."
3453,,
3454,,
3455,,[12] I know not whether this cruel and stupid custom is common in

3460,,"circumstances. They happened two or three and twenty years ago, in"

3469,,
3470,,
3471,,The coffin[14] as I past across the lane
3472,,"Came sudden on my view. It was not here,"
3473,,"A sight of every day, as in the streets"
3474,,"Of the great city, and we paus’d and ask’d"
3475,,"Who to the grave was going. It was one,"
3476,,"A village girl, they told us, who had borne"
3477,,"An eighteen months strange illness, and had pined"
3478,,With such slow wasting that the hour of death
3479,,Came welcome to her. We pursued our way
3480,,"To the house of mirth, and with that idle talk"
3481,,"That passes o’er the mind and is forgot,"
3482,,We wore away the time. But it was eve
3483,,"When homewardly I went, and in the air"
3484,,"Was that cool freshness, that discolouring shade"
3485,,That makes the eye turn inward. Then I heard
3486,,Over the vale the heavy toll of death
3487,,"Sound slow; it made me think upon the dead,"
3488,,I questioned more and learnt her sorrowful tale.
3489,,"She bore unhusbanded a mother’s name,"
3490,,"And he who should have cherished her, far off"
3491,,"Sail’d on the seas, self-exil’d from his home,"
3492,,"For he was poor. Left thus, a wretched one,"
3493,,"Scorn made a mock of her, and evil tongues"
3494,,Were busy with her name. She had one ill
3495,,"Heavier, neglect, forgetfulness from him"
3496,,"Whom she had loved so dearly. Once he wrote,"
3497,,But only once that drop of comfort came
3498,,To mingle with her cup of wretchedness;
3499,,"And when his parents had some tidings from him,"
3500,,"There was no mention of poor Hannah there,"
3501,,"Or ’twas the cold enquiry, bitterer"
3502,,Than silence. So she pined and pined away
3503,,"And for herself and baby toil’d and toil’d,"
3504,,"Nor did she, even on her death bed, rest"
3505,,"From labour, knitting with her outstretch’d arms"
3506,,Till she sunk with very weakness. Her old mother
3507,,"Omitted no kind office, and she work’d"
3508,,"Hard, and with hardest working barely earn’d"
3509,,Enough to make life struggle and prolong
3510,,The pains of grief and sickness. Thus she lay
3511,,"On the sick bed of poverty, so worn"
3512,,With her long suffering and that painful thought
3513,,"That at her heart lay rankling, and so weak,"
3514,,That she could make no effort to express
3515,,"Affection for her infant; and the child,"
3516,,Whose lisping love perhaps had solaced her
3517,,With a strange infantine ingratitude
3518,,Shunn’d her as one indifferent. She was past
3519,,"That anguish, for she felt her hour draw on,"
3520,,And ’twas her only comfoft now to think
3521,,"Upon the grave. “Poor girl!” her mother said,"
3522,,“Thou hast suffered much!” “aye mother! there is none
3523,,"“Can tell what I have suffered!” she replied,"
3524,,“But I shall soon be where the weary rest.”
3525,,"And she did rest her soon, for it pleased God"
3526,,To take her to his mercy.
3527,,
3528,,
3529,,[14] It is proper to remark that the story related in this Eclogue
3530,,"is strictly true. I met the funeral, and learnt the circumstances"
3531,,in a village in Hampshire. The indifference of the child was
3532,,mentioned to me; indeed no addition whatever has been made to the
3533,,story. I should have thought it wrong to have weakened the effect
3534,,of a faithful narrative by adding any thing.

3542,,_Woman_.
3543,,Sir for the love of God some small relief
3544,,To a poor woman!
3545,,
3546,,_Traveller_.
3547,,Whither are you bound?
3548,,"’Tis a late hour to travel o’er these downs,"
3549,,"No house for miles around us, and the way"
3550,,Dreary and wild. The evening wind already
3551,,"Makes one’s teeth chatter, and the very Sun,"
3552,,"Setting so pale behind those thin white clouds,"
3553,,Looks cold. ’Twill be a bitter night!
3554,,
3555,,_Woman_.
3556,,Aye Sir
3557,,"’Tis cutting keen! I smart at every breath,"
3558,,"Heaven knows how I shall reach my journey’s end,"
3559,,"For the way is long before me, and my feet,"
3560,,"God help me! sore with travelling. I would gladly,"
3561,,"If it pleased God, lie down at once and die."
3562,,
3563,,_Traveller_.
3564,,Nay nay cheer up! a little food and rest
3565,,Will comfort you; and then your journey’s end
3566,,"Will make amends for all. You shake your head,"
3567,,And weep. Is it some evil business then
3568,,That leads you from your home?
3569,,
3570,,_Woman_.
3571,,Sir I am going
3572,,"To see my son at Plymouth, sadly hurt"
3573,,"In the late action, and in the hospital"
3574,,"Dying, I fear me, now."
3575,,
3576,,_Traveller_.
3577,,Perhaps your fears
3578,,Make evil worse. Even if a limb be lost
3579,,There may be still enough for comfort left
3580,,"An arm or leg shot off, there’s yet the heart"
3581,,"To keep life warm, and he may live to talk"
3582,,"With pleasure of the glorious fight that maim’d him,"
3583,,Proud of his loss. Old England’s gratitude
3584,,Makes the maim’d sailor happy.
3585,,
3586,,_Woman_.
3587,,’Tis not that—
3588,,An arm or leg—I could have borne with that.
3589,,"’Twas not a ball, it was some cursed thing"
3590,,Which bursts[15] and burns that hurt him. Something Sir
3591,,They do not use on board our English ships
3592,,It is so wicked!
3593,,
3594,,_Traveller_.
3595,,Rascals! a mean art
3596,,"Of cruel cowardice, yet all in vain!"
3597,,
3598,,_Woman_.
3599,,Yes Sir! and they should show no mercy to them
3600,,For making use of such unchristian arms.
3601,,"I had a letter from the hospital,"
3602,,"He got some friend to write it, and he tells me"
3603,,"That my poor boy has lost his precious eyes,"
3604,,Burnt out. Alas! that I should ever live
3605,,To see this wretched day!—they tell me Sir
3606,,There is no cure for wounds like his. Indeed
3607,,’Tis a hard journey that I go upon
3608,,To such a dismal end!
3609,,
3610,,_Traveller_.
3611,,He yet may live.
3612,,"But if the worst should chance, why you must bear"
3613,,The will of heaven with patience. Were it not
3614,,Some comfort to reflect your son has fallen
3615,,Fighting his country’s cause? and for yourself
3616,,You will not in unpitied poverty
3617,,Be left to mourn his loss. Your grateful country
3618,,Amid the triumph of her victory
3619,,"Remember those who paid its price of blood,"
3620,,And with a noble charity relieves
3621,,The widow and the orphan.
3622,,
3623,,_Woman_.
3624,,God reward them!
3625,,"God bless them, it will help me in my age"
3626,,But Sir! it will not pay me for my child!
3627,,
3628,,_Traveller_.
3629,,Was he your only child?
3630,,
3631,,_Woman_.
3632,,"My only one,"
3633,,"The stay and comfort of my widowhood,"
3634,,A dear good boy!—when first he went to sea
3635,,"I felt what it would come to,—something told me"
3636,,I should be childless soon. But tell me Sir
3637,,If it be true that for a hurt like his
3638,,There is no cure? please God to spare his life
3639,,"Tho’ he be blind, yet I should be so thankful!"
3640,,I can remember there was a blind man
3641,,"Lived in our village, one from his youth up"
3642,,"Quite dark, and yet he was a merry man,"
3643,,And he had none to tend on him so well
3644,,As I would tend my boy!
3645,,
3646,,_Traveller_.
3647,,Of this be sure
3648,,"His hurts are look’d to well, and the best help"
3649,,"The place affords, as rightly is his due,"
3650,,Ever at hand. How happened it he left you?
3651,,Was a seafaring life his early choice?
3652,,
3653,,_Woman_.
3654,,No Sir! poor fellow—he was wise enough
3655,,"To be content at home, and ’twas a home"
3656,,"As comfortable Sir I even tho’ I say it,"
3657,,As any in the country. He was left
3658,,"A little boy when his poor father died,"
3659,,Just old enough to totter by himself
3660,,"And call his mother’s name. We two were all,"
3661,,And as we were not left quite destitute
3662,,We bore up well. In the summer time I worked
3663,,"Sometimes a-field. Then I was famed for knitting,"
3664,,And in long winter nights my spinning wheel
3665,,Seldom stood still. We had kind neighbours too
3666,,And never felt distress. So he grew up
3667,,A comely lad and wonderous well disposed;
3668,,I taught him well; there was not in the parish
3669,,"A child who said his prayers more regular,"
3670,,Or answered readier thro’ his catechism.
3671,,If I had foreseen this! but ’tis a blessing
3672,,We do’nt know what we’re born to!
3673,,
3674,,_Traveller_.
3675,,But how came it
3676,,He chose to be a Sailor?
3677,,
3678,,_Woman_.
3679,,You shall hear Sir;
3680,,As he grew up he used to watch the birds
3681,,"In the corn, child’s work you know, and easily done."
3682,,"’Tis an idle sort of task, so he built up"
3683,,A little hut of wicker-work and clay
3684,,"Under the hedge, to shelter him in rain."
3685,,And then he took for very idleness
3686,,"To making traps to catch the plunderers,"
3687,,All sorts of cunning traps that boys can make—
3688,,"Propping a stone to fall and shut them in,"
3689,,"Or crush them with its weight, or else a springe"
3690,,Swung on a bough. He made them cleverly—
3691,,"And I, poor foolish woman! I was pleased"
3692,,To see the boy so handy. You may guess
3693,,What followed Sir from this unlucky skill.
3694,,He did what he should not when he was older:
3695,,I warn’d him oft enough; but he was caught
3696,,"In wiring hares at last, and had his choice"
3697,,The prison or the ship.
3698,,
3699,,_Traveller_.
3700,,The choice at least
3701,,"Was kindly left him, and for broken laws"
3702,,This was methinks no heavy punishment.
3703,,
3704,,_Woman_.
3705,,"So I was told Sir. And I tried to think so,"
3706,,But ’twas a sad blow to me! I was used
3707,,To sleep at nights soundly and undisturb’d—
3708,,"Now if the wind blew rough, it made me start"
3709,,And think of my poor boy tossing about
3710,,Upon the roaring seas. And then I seem’d
3711,,To feel that it was hard to take him from me
3712,,For such a little fault. But he was wrong
3713,,Oh very wrong—a murrain on his traps!
3714,,See what they’ve brought him too!
3715,,
3716,,_Traveller_.
3717,,Well! well! take comfort
3718,,He will be taken care of if he lives;
3719,,"And should you lose your child, this is a country"
3720,,Where the brave sailor never leaves a parent
3721,,To weep for him in want.
3722,,
3723,,_Woman_.
3724,,Sir I shall want
3725,,No succour long. In the common course of years
3726,,"I soon must be at rest, and ’tis a comfort"
3727,,When grief is hard upon me to reflect
3728,,It only leads me to that rest the sooner.

3734,,"Eclogue, lost both his eyes. It would be policy and humanity to"
3735,,"employ means of destruction, could they be discovered, powerful"
3736,,"enough to destroy fleets and armies, but to use any thing that only"
3737,,"inflicts additional torture upon the victims of our war systems, is"

3749,,"I laid two straws across at Margery’s door,"
3750,,And afterwards I fear’d that she might do me
3751,,A mischief for’t. There was the Miller’s boy
3752,,"Who set his dog at that black cat of hers,"
3753,,"I met him upon crutches, and he told me"
3754,,’Twas all her evil eye.
3755,,
3756,,_Father_.
3757,,’Tis rare good luck;
3758,,I would have gladly given a crown for one
3759,,If t’would have done as well. But where did’st find it?
3760,,
3761,,_Nathaniel_.
3762,,Down on the Common; I was going a-field
3763,,And neighbour Saunders pass’d me on his mare;
3764,,"He had hardly said “good day,” before I saw"
3765,,The shoe drop off; ’twas just upon my tongue

3785,,_Nathaniel_.
3786,,Why he ha’nt been rid again!
3787,,Last night I hung a pebble by the manger

3789,,That ’tis a special charm against the hags.
3790,,
3791,,_Father_.
3792,,"It could not be a proper natural hole then,"
3793,,"Or ’twas not a right pebble,—for I found him"
3794,,"Smoking with sweat, quaking in every limb,"
3795,,And panting so! God knows where he had been
3796,,"When we were all asleep, thro’ bush and brake"
3797,,"Up-hill and down-hill all alike, full stretch"
3798,,At such a deadly rate!—
3799,,
3800,,_Nathaniel_.
3801,,"By land and water,"
3802,,Over the sea perhaps!—I have heard tell
3803,,"That ’tis some thousand miles, almost at the end"
3804,,"Of the world, where witches go to meet the Devil."
3805,,"They used to ride on broomsticks, and to smear"
3806,,Some ointment over them and then away
3807,,Out of the window! but ’tis worse than all
3808,,To worry the poor beasts so. Shame upon it
3809,,That in a Christian country they should let
3810,,Such creatures live!
3811,,
3812,,_Father_.
3813,,And when there’s such plain proof!
3814,,I did but threaten her because she robb’d
3815,,"Our hedge, and the next night there came a wind"
3816,,That made me shake to hear it in my bed!
3817,,"How came it that that storm unroofed my barn,"
3818,,And only mine in the parish? look at her
3819,,And that’s enough; she has it in her face—
3820,,"A pair of large dead eyes, rank in her head,"
3821,,"Just like a corpse, and purs’d with wrinkles round,"
3822,,A nose and chin that scarce leave room between
3823,,"For her lean fingers to squeeze in the snuff,"
3824,,And when she speaks! I’d sooner hear a raven
3825,,"Croak at my door! she sits there, nose and knees"
3826,,"Smoak-dried and shrivell’d over a starved fire,"
3827,,"With that black cat beside her, whose great eyes"

3872,,To have her very miseries made her crimes!
3873,,I met her but last week in that hard frost
3874,,"That made my young limbs ache, and when I ask’d"
3875,,"What brought her out in the snow, the poor old woman"
3876,,Told me that she was forced to crawl abroad
3877,,"And pick the hedges, just to keep herself"
3878,,"From perishing with cold, because no neighbour"
3879,,"Had pity on her age; and then she cried,"
3880,,"And said the children pelted her with snow-balls,"
3881,,And wish’d that she were dead.

3928,,"Farmer, I’m going"

3930,,"Old, poor, and sick! a miserable lot,"
3931,,And death will be a blessing. You might send her
3932,,"Some little matter, something comfortable,"
3933,,That she may go down easier to the grave
3934,,And bless you when she dies.

3936,,_Father_.
3937,,What! is she going!
3938,,Well God forgive her then! if she has dealt
3939,,"In the black art. I’ll tell my dame of it,"
3940,,And she shall send her something.

3965,,"Aye Charles! I knew that this would fix thine eye,"
3966,,"This woodbine wreathing round the broken porch,"
3967,,"Its leaves just withering, yet one autumn flower"
3968,,Still fresh and fragrant; and yon holly-hock
3969,,That thro’ the creeping weeds and nettles tall
3970,,"Peers taller, and uplifts its column’d stem"
3971,,Bright with the broad rose-blossoms. I have seen
3972,,"Many a fallen convent reverend in decay,"
3973,,And many a time have trod the castle courts
3974,,"And grass-green halls, yet never did they strike"
3975,,Home to the heart such melancholy thoughts
3976,,"As this poor cottage. Look, its little hatch"
3977,,Fleeced with that grey and wintry moss; the roof
3978,,"Part mouldered in, the rest o’ergrown with weeds,"
3979,,House-leek and long thin grass and greener moss;
3980,,So Nature wars with all the works of man.
3981,,"And, like himself, reduces back to earth"
3982,,His perishable piles.
3983,,I led thee here
3984,,"Charles, not without design; for this hath been"

3989,,"Woke in my heart the love of poesy,"
3990,,"How with the villagers Erminia dwelt,"
3991,,And Calidore for a fair shepherdess
3992,,Forgot his quest to learn the shepherd’s lore;
3993,,"My fancy drew from, this the little hut"
3994,,"Where that poor princess wept her hopeless love,"
3995,,Or where the gentle Calidore at eve
3996,,Led Pastorella home. There was not then
3997,,A weed where all these nettles overtop
3998,,"The garden wall; but sweet-briar, scenting sweet"
3999,,"The morning air, rosemary and marjoram,"
4000,,"All wholesome herbs; and then, that woodbine wreath’d"

4017,,And spinning in the sun; methinks I see her
4018,,Raising her eyes and dark-rimm’d spectacles
4019,,"To see the passer by, yet ceasing not"
4020,,To twirl her lengthening thread. Or in the garden
4021,,"On some dry summer evening, walking round"
4022,,"To view her flowers, and pointing, as she lean’d"
4023,,"Upon the ivory handle of her stick,"
4024,,To some carnation whose o’erheavy head
4025,,"Needed support, while with the watering-pot"
4026,,"Joanna followed, and refresh’d and trimm’d"
4027,,"The drooping plant; Joanna, her dear child,"
4028,,As lovely and as happy then as youth
4029,,And innocence could make her.
4030,,Charles! it seems
4031,,"As tho’ I were a boy again, and all"
4032,,The mediate years with their vicissitudes
4033,,A half-forgotten dream. I see the Maid
4034,,"So comely in her Sunday dress! her hair,"
4035,,"Her bright brown hair, wreath’d in contracting curls,"
4036,,And then her cheek! it was a red and white
4037,,"That made the delicate hues of art look loathsome,"
4038,,The countrymen who on their way to church
4039,,"Were leaning o’er the bridge, loitering to hear"
4040,,"The bell’s last summons, and in idleness"
4041,,"Watching the stream below, would all look up"
4042,,"When she pass’d by. And her old Mother, Charles!"
4043,,When I have beard some erring infidel
4044,,"Speak of our faith as of a gloomy creed,"
4045,,Inspiring fear and boding wretchedness.
4046,,Her figure has recurr’d; for she did love
4047,,"The sabbath-day, and many a time has cross’d"
4048,,These fields in rain and thro’ the winter snows.
4049,,"When I, a graceless boy, wishing myself"
4050,,"By the fire-side, have wondered why _she_ came"
4051,,Who might have sate at home.
4052,,One only care
4053,,"Hung on her aged spirit. For herself,"
4054,,"Her path was plain before her, and the close"
4055,,Of her long journey near. But then her child
4056,,"Soon to be left alone in this bad world,—"
4057,,That was a thought that many a winter night
4058,,Had kept her sleepless: and when prudent love
4059,,In something better than a servant’s slate
4060,,"Had placed her well at last, it was a pang"
4061,,Like parting life to part with her dear girl.
4062,,
4063,,"One summer, Charles, when at the holydays"
4064,,"Return’d from school, I visited again"
4065,,"My old accustomed walks, and found in them."
4066,,"A joy almost like meeting an old friend,"
4067,,"I saw the cottage empty, and the weeds"
4068,,Already crowding the neglected flowers.
4069,,Joanna by a villain’s wiles seduced
4070,,"Had played the wanton, and that blow had reach’d"
4071,,"Her mother’s heart. She did not suffer long,"
4072,,"Her age was feeble, and the heavy blow"
4073,,Brought her grey hairs with sorrow to the grave.
4074,,
4075,,I pass this ruin’d dwelling oftentimes
4076,,And think of other days. It wakes in me
4077,,"A transient sadness, but the feelings Charles"
4078,,"That ever with these recollections rise,"
4079,,I trust in God they will not pass away.
