157,FOREWORD,
158,FOREWORD,"TERESA FRANCES THOMPSON, who also bore my name by marriage, died on"
159,FOREWORD,"January 26, 1919. This verse is published to her memory, because I"
160,FOREWORD,wish to keep together the poetry she occasioned and enable those who
161,FOREWORD,loved her--and they were a great many-to know definitely what she was
162,FOREWORD,to me.
163,FOREWORD,
164,FOREWORD,I think that is the truth. This is the only means I have at present of
165,FOREWORD,acknowledging publicly the vast debt I owe to her.
166,FOREWORD,
167,FOREWORD,As I turn these poems over--if they are even to be called poems--I
168,FOREWORD,realize that they can never begin to express what her personality was.
169,FOREWORD,"The earliest ones were written by a boy who was in love, and the"
170,FOREWORD,latest by a man who has suddenly stepped into the dark. Those between
171,FOREWORD,are fragments from the days when we were struggling along together at
172,FOREWORD,the everyday tasks and outside interests and dreams that possessed us.
173,FOREWORD,"The war entered our lives to change them in September, 1917. The poem,"
174,FOREWORD,"""Man Possessed,"" was written within sound of her actual voice, the"
175,FOREWORD,others all in absence from her at various times and in moods made
176,FOREWORD,strange by absence.
177,FOREWORD,
178,FOREWORD,And yet this is all I have at present to give in her memory. But I
179,FOREWORD,"hold by these because--though they are poor, freakish fragments as far"
180,FOREWORD,as any real expression of her is concerned--they were made for her.
181,FOREWORD,
182,FOREWORD,It is even harder to express in bald prose a personality that had so
183,FOREWORD,"many sides, so many varying strengths, such inner sight and yet such a"
184,FOREWORD,forthright splendid intelligence. I have tried once to round it into
185,FOREWORD,periods--and have destroyed the attempt. It is my hope that the sister
186,FOREWORD,to whom she was devoted with an attachment altogether unusual to most
187,FOREWORD,of us will write of her.
188,FOREWORD,
189,FOREWORD,"If I merely recount the outlines of her life, it loses her. To say"
190,FOREWORD,that her girlhood was given up to an intense and whole-souled devotion
191,FOREWORD,to the life of Christ as taught by the Roman Catholic Church will not
192,FOREWORD,"even trace the outlines of that great spiritual adventure. But there,"
193,FOREWORD,"in the word ""adventure,"" is a dim ideograph of what she found in life."
194,FOREWORD,Every day was an adventure to her with the hope of accomplishing
195,FOREWORD,something over and above mere routine and the pursuit of pleasure. And
196,FOREWORD,she used to say to me that her life had simply been a series of
197,FOREWORD,"experiments into which she had put her whole heart, and in which she"
198,FOREWORD,"had always failed. But, of course, she never failed."
199,FOREWORD,
200,FOREWORD,She wrote me while I was stationed at Washington:
201,FOREWORD,
202,FOREWORD,"""I am so very glad of your Sunday experience. I wish that I might have"
203,FOREWORD,"shared it with you, but I almost did, since we were at Mass there and"
204,FOREWORD,walked across that green together.... No one else might be impressed
205,FOREWORD,"by it, but you _know_. When I first thought of a convent I was"
206,FOREWORD,"about sixteen, and I did not go until I was twenty-one. During that"
207,FOREWORD,time I had the habit of pretending when I went to sleep that I was
208,FOREWORD,"lying full-length in a convent chapel before a dark altar, with its"
209,FOREWORD,"tiny light. When I went to the Little Sisters, with all its"
210,FOREWORD,"strangeness and homesickness and wrench away from everything, I was"
211,FOREWORD,sustained by the knowledge that our bedroom on the third floor was
212,FOREWORD,across a wide hall from a rose window that looked right down into the
213,FOREWORD,"Chapel. The dormitory had windows out into the hall, French fashion,"
214,FOREWORD,so that when I opened the one at the head of my bed I was doing just
215,FOREWORD,what I had so often planned. You cannot imagine how personal it seemed
216,FOREWORD,to me.
217,FOREWORD,
218,FOREWORD,"""Then years after when I was in the Carmelite convent in London, it"
219,FOREWORD,began to snow. I stood at a window looking out at the snow upon the
220,FOREWORD,"roofs, and began to think (as you would have in my place), ""Deep on the"
221,FOREWORD,"convent roofs the snows are sparkling to the moon,""--and suddenly I"
222,FOREWORD,"realized that it was St. Agnes Eve, and that long ago, when I was"
223,FOREWORD,"perhaps fifteen or sixteen, I had prayed that I might be a Carmelite"
224,FOREWORD,nun in England. It was a thrill. No one else knew it. No one else
225,FOREWORD,could possibly have brought either of those two things about but Jesus
226,FOREWORD,"Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever."""
227,FOREWORD,
228,FOREWORD,And she wrote me later:
229,FOREWORD,
230,FOREWORD,"""We will make a go of it together--I have been just where you are"
231,FOREWORD,several times in my life. There is no denying that it hurts like the
232,FOREWORD,"mischief, but there is something carried away out of it that the"
233,FOREWORD,people who don't go through with it do not have. When I came back from
234,FOREWORD,"the Little Sisters, after affirming and reaffirming (to strengthen my"
235,FOREWORD,"own resolution) that I was never coming back, I had to face just the"
236,FOREWORD,"same old world, and the same streets and people. Then, after the"
237,FOREWORD,"earthquake, I left Paul Elder's to go out to the settlement in the"
238,FOREWORD,"Mission. I was full of faith in it, to work among the poor, without"
239,FOREWORD,"the fetters of a convent, to plan a new way in which Catholic girls"
240,FOREWORD,"could dedicate themselves to the service of God, using the best of the"
241,FOREWORD,Protestant and Catholic ideas both--and in three months I... had
242,FOREWORD,handed in a report which criticized the whole place severely--and my
243,FOREWORD,resignation. I do not know now how much was personal spite on my part
244,FOREWORD,and how far I was right. And back to the same old circle at Paul
245,FOREWORD,"Elder's, with another bright bubble broken. Then came the Carmelites,"
246,FOREWORD,"which cost, I think, more than any, and I remember I so dreaded coming"
247,FOREWORD,back to New York and facing everyone that I tried hard to get a
248,FOREWORD,position in London where women get $5.00 a week as trained librarians.
249,FOREWORD,"So back again. Well, education as the world hands it out to us is a"
250,FOREWORD,mighty expensive thing. You give so much of your heart's blood and get
251,FOREWORD,"so little back in any tangible form, but 'youth shows but half' and we"
252,FOREWORD,have not yet come to the harvesting years. We might as well sow hopes
253,FOREWORD,and plans and ambitions generously 'and stretch through time a hand to
254,FOREWORD,"reap the far-off interest of tears'."""
255,FOREWORD,
256,FOREWORD,"And she said of the number 19 in her life, in the late fall of 1918:"
257,FOREWORD,
258,FOREWORD,"""I was thinking a lot about life this morning, coming home from"
259,FOREWORD,church. You know the 27th of November is Mother's anniversary....
260,FOREWORD,"Today is the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, always a great"
261,FOREWORD,"Catholic Feast ... Father's birthday was the 23rd of December, he was"
262,FOREWORD,buried on Christmas day--their wedding anniversary was December 3lst--
263,FOREWORD,"my birthday is January first, J--'s the seventh, Mother's the fifth."
264,FOREWORD,"So the whole season is full of memories, churches, masses, prayers,"
265,FOREWORD,associations. And it struck me as strange that this New Year's
266,FOREWORD,finishes another half of my life. I was nineteen that winter. This
267,FOREWORD,"year I shall be just twice that. Nineteen years were all childhood,"
268,FOREWORD,"dreaming, planning, hoping, aspiring, but with no practical care,"
269,FOREWORD,"no responsibilities of any sort, the most sheltered existence a girl"
270,FOREWORD,could have. And now nineteen of as varied an experience as most
271,FOREWORD,"people know, teaching, housekeeping, bringing up the younger children,"
272,FOREWORD,"seven years of Paul Elder's, the settlement house, travel, London,"
273,FOREWORD,"Rome, Paris, New York, the two convents in Chicago and London, extreme"
274,FOREWORD,"poverty, self-support, comfortable, moderate means, as you and I had,"
275,FOREWORD,"luxury such as this and the months with E--, six years a wife, five"
276,FOREWORD,"years a mother when J--'s birthday rounds it out,--the earthquake,"
277,FOREWORD,which we thought transcended in size and importance anything that
278,FOREWORD,"would ever happen to us, and then our little share of the tragedy of"
279,FOREWORD,"the war. Nineteen full years, n'est-ce pas? And now we start a new"
280,FOREWORD,"life, thank God, together."""
281,FOREWORD,
282,FOREWORD,"She wrote me earlier, in 1917, while I was waiting to be called to a"
283,FOREWORD,Southern training camp:
284,FOREWORD,
285,FOREWORD,"""I plan a home some day of the most Spartan simplicity, all our needs"
286,FOREWORD,"cut down to the lowest and plainest of possessions, and yet a spirit"
287,FOREWORD,"of hospitality, of contentment, of gaiety, of self-reliance and mutual"
288,FOREWORD,"helpfulness. Books and bookshelves..."""
289,FOREWORD,
290,FOREWORD,And of the Army:
291,FOREWORD,
292,FOREWORD,"""It so often makes me think of the religious orders. The combination"
293,FOREWORD,of the most heroic impulses with the most commonplace drudgery. The
294,FOREWORD,"extraordinary fluctuations of feeling, thinking at one time that it is"
295,FOREWORD,"the only thing in the world to do ... and then the feeling, what am I"
296,FOREWORD,"doing this for, anyway, other people do not find it necessary... As"
297,FOREWORD,"one nun said to me, 'You do not have to accept a Carmelite vocation--"
298,FOREWORD,"but, you have to either accept or refuse it.' The choice is laid"
299,FOREWORD,"before everyone, but once it is, all the coward has to do is to stand"
300,FOREWORD,"aside."""
301,FOREWORD,
302,FOREWORD,This last illustrates how she always saw the necessities of those she
303,FOREWORD,loved in terms of the spirit. Napoleon is reported to have said of
304,FOREWORD,"Jesus Christ: ""He speaks from the soul as never man spoke; the soul is"
305,FOREWORD,"sufficient for him, as he is sufficient for the soul."""
306,FOREWORD,
307,FOREWORD,So she thought. And her letters contain many quotations she formed her
308,FOREWORD,life by:
309,FOREWORD,
310,FOREWORD,"""God himself is Truth, Charity, and Purity, and the three things he"
311,FOREWORD,"hates most are deceit, cruelty, and impurity."""
312,FOREWORD,
313,FOREWORD,"""God make us all saints!"""
314,FOREWORD,
315,FOREWORD,"And the characteristic ending of a letter, with her full name always"
316,FOREWORD,"signed, such as:"
317,FOREWORD,
318,FOREWORD,"""Lord, grant us in this world knowledge of thy truth, and in the world"
319,FOREWORD,to come life everlasting.
320,FOREWORD,
321,"TERESA.""","TERESA."""
322,"TERESA.""",
323,"TERESA.""",
324,"TERESA.""",But it is impossible to convey what her ways were with the children
325,"TERESA.""",and in the several homes that she made so full of dreaming light. She
326,"TERESA.""",had a keen appreciation of the humorousness and quaintness of
327,"TERESA.""","children. She was always quoting to me their adventures, their"
328,"TERESA.""","sayings. She had countless plans and schemes for work in the world,"
329,"TERESA.""","and carried out many of them in relation to woman suffrage, baby"
330,"TERESA.""","clinics, camp-fire organization for the girls of our village, and,"
331,"TERESA.""","during the war, work with all the local organizations among women that"
332,"TERESA.""",it called into being where she was living at the time. She wanted to
333,"TERESA.""","start a home in America for French widows and orphans, though this"
334,"TERESA.""","plan was not possible,--she was deeply interested in the work for the"
335,"TERESA.""","protection of young girls under Miss Katharine Bement Davis, and only"
336,"TERESA.""",circumstances prevented her taking this up during the fall of 1918.
337,"TERESA.""",She had several interviews with Miss Davis and showed herself to be
338,"TERESA.""","the very person who could have helped greatly. Self-denial, sacrifice,"
339,"TERESA.""","poverty, effort were the watchwords ever recurring to her. Her instant"
340,"TERESA.""",concentration upon any book or paper that came under her eyes became a
341,"TERESA.""","family joke. She would be lost immediately, oblivious of all"
342,"TERESA.""",surroundings. She read and thought with a lively appreciation of the
343,"TERESA.""",many futilities in life and a desire to make her life count. She
344,"TERESA.""","wasted no time on what did not at once attract her spirit, except of"
345,"TERESA.""",necessity. And yet she genuinely delighted in the small events of a
346,"TERESA.""",day such as please and awe children. And the reason they loved her so
347,"TERESA.""",was because they knew she brought the same guileless point of view to
348,"TERESA.""",solve their bewilderment from larger experience. And yet she would
349,"TERESA.""",write:
350,"TERESA.""",
351,"TERESA.""","""I _wish_ I knew where I stood. I was much happier when I was a"
352,"TERESA.""",rigid Catholic. I wish I could fit back into that measure. Can I ever--
353,"TERESA.""","any more than I can fit into the mental measure of a nun?"""
354,"TERESA.""",
355,"TERESA.""",And again her typewriting would exclaim to me:
356,"TERESA.""",
357,"TERESA.""","""I don't like to write letters to you. I like to talk to you. I like"
358,"TERESA.""","still better to be silent with you!"""
359,"TERESA.""",
360,"TERESA.""",When she thought me in need of it she could be very self-forgetful:
361,"TERESA.""",
362,"TERESA.""","""But I want to see the future big with Romance for you and I would"
363,"TERESA.""","rather feel you came home from voyages two weeks or two months long,"
364,"TERESA.""","with a trunkful of manuscripts; and that, three years from today, you"
365,"TERESA.""","had secured us special rates on a tramp steamer to Plymouth, than that"
366,"TERESA.""","you were going to dodge into subways the rest of your life."""
367,"TERESA.""",
368,"TERESA.""","""I would infinitely rather you shipped before the mast--to Bermuda,"
369,"TERESA.""","Borneo, or Buenos Aires. Don't think from this I don't want your face"
370,"TERESA.""","across the table from mine every night the rest of my life!"""
371,"TERESA.""",
372,"TERESA.""","Reading to the children, she would retail to me such incidents as:"
373,"TERESA.""",
374,"TERESA.""","""Then I read them the Gospel stories, ... and they were too funny--R--"
375,"TERESA.""","trying to show me how Herod looked, and J-- suggesting charitably that"
376,"TERESA.""","perhaps his wife was good. 'No,' said R--,'the whole family was bad!'"""
377,"TERESA.""",
378,"TERESA.""","""In the spring I am going to take an old farmhouse, give the children"
379,"TERESA.""","one brown garment apiece, and plan a scheme of living that will leave"
380,"TERESA.""","something over for other children."""
381,"TERESA.""",
382,"TERESA.""",And this appealed to her:
383,"TERESA.""",
384,"TERESA.""","""Well, if it is not in the Fall of 1918, it will be in 'one of those"
385,"TERESA.""",houses Our Lord is building' as J-- remarks casually. Did I tell you
386,"TERESA.""",of the little village in the North Carolina hills where H-- and S. L--
387,"TERESA.""","spent the summer, where the women raised enough sheep to cut the wool,"
388,"TERESA.""","card, and spin and weave the clothes the family wore?"""
389,"TERESA.""",
390,"TERESA.""","In the winter of 1914 she first visited Augusta, Georgia, where my"
391,"TERESA.""","father was stationed, and there the campaign against Child Labor, in"
392,"TERESA.""","which she was always vitally interested, became doubly real in"
393,"TERESA.""",necessity to her as she went through the cotton mills and saw
394,"TERESA.""",conditions at close range. She always gave what sums she could to this
395,"TERESA.""","cause. In 1915, perhaps the most famous year of the woman suffrage"
396,"TERESA.""","battle, she was campaigning, speaking, watching all day at the polls"
397,"TERESA.""","in her village of Port Washington, Long Island. I remember her"
398,"TERESA.""",speaking from the stage of the Republican Club against a clever anti-
399,"TERESA.""",suffragist from New York. Her voice reached out for something in the
400,"TERESA.""",hearts of her audience hid deeper than the appeal of a mere
401,"TERESA.""","legislative reform. She knew her intellectual ground, but it was"
402,"TERESA.""",something deeper than intellectuality that went home.
403,"TERESA.""",
404,"TERESA.""",In 1918 the Baby Welfare Movement was at its height. She became
405,"TERESA.""",chairman of the Augusta committee and established clinics at the
406,"TERESA.""",different schools and social centres.
407,"TERESA.""",
408,"TERESA.""","So I grasp at her life, giving only a slight indication of how full it"
409,"TERESA.""","was. Her friends were of every type and kind, of every religious"
410,"TERESA.""","belief or lack of belief, of many different political opinions."
411,"TERESA.""",
412,"TERESA.""",She hated war with her whole soul. It was directly opposed to the
413,"TERESA.""",words of Christ. But she wrote me in a dark time:
414,"TERESA.""",
415,"TERESA.""","""Italy is bad, Russia is bad, Cambrai is bad. But those things are"
416,"TERESA.""",only phases in the eternal struggle of right against wrong. And the
417,"TERESA.""",only thing that matters is to personally throw your whole life into
418,"TERESA.""","the balance for the things you believe to be right."""
419,"TERESA.""",
420,"TERESA.""",How far I failed her! It is given to every man to fight somehow
421,"TERESA.""",through the bewilderment of life with the best intentions he can
422,"TERESA.""",realize. And life seems to me like a fierce current on which we are
423,"TERESA.""",borne rather than anything we can really master--except by forgetting
424,"TERESA.""",it. She has left me with the feeling that I must know infinitely more
425,"TERESA.""","and try to understand better, and that we are governed most truly only"
426,"TERESA.""","by the inexplicable. ""Meanwhile, there is our life here--Well?"""
427,"TERESA.""",

897,A TAPER OF INCENSE,Waving above the dinning throng of the days
898,A TAPER OF INCENSE,Pennants of purple and oriflammes of crimson
899,A TAPER OF INCENSE,And cloths of gold.
900,A TAPER OF INCENSE,Your varying device is on every shining shield
901,A TAPER OF INCENSE,Of the brilliant row that flames beneath the eaves
902,A TAPER OF INCENSE,Of that house whose street is cobbled with silver clouds.
903,A TAPER OF INCENSE,

905,A TAPER OF INCENSE,"Dark and bright, tramping to tread the earth."
906,A TAPER OF INCENSE,"Ever, with trumpets and tumult, rigor or laughter,"
907,A TAPER OF INCENSE,"They pass saluting, to press upon the world,"
908,A TAPER OF INCENSE,Regiment after regiment unnumbered.
909,A TAPER OF INCENSE,
910,A TAPER OF INCENSE,Your beauty is a balcony hung with banners
911,A TAPER OF INCENSE,To wave them on. The foremost have sent your name
912,A TAPER OF INCENSE,Echoing rearward to hearten new battalions.

914,A TAPER OF INCENSE,It is the vivid standard of the dawn
915,A TAPER OF INCENSE,Flapping over dazed dream-voyagers

988,TO PURITY,"Ah, holy goddess, so wonderful were you!"
989,TO PURITY,
990,TO PURITY,"So now Man hath smeared filth upon your altar,"
991,TO PURITY,"And, slant-eyed and slime-lipped, wrought sins apart."
992,TO PURITY,His tongue intones an abominable psalter
993,TO PURITY,"Hoarsely, and on his brows cold sweat-drops start,--"
994,TO PURITY,"Nor through your oracles speaks he from his heart,"
995,TO PURITY,Hearing you in the porches of his ears;
996,TO PURITY,"His eyes are blind of you, where only smart"
997,TO PURITY,The sick revulsions of his ignorant tears.
998,TO PURITY,
999,TO PURITY,"No! He intones by rote a coded praise,"
1000,TO PURITY,"Unto a leering two-faced god falls prone,"
1001,TO PURITY,And smears with lust and fear his alternate days
1002,TO PURITY,For monstrous imaginations to atone;
1003,TO PURITY,"For you, most instant, most ardent,--you are flown"
1004,TO PURITY,"Like fumes to his clownish brain, and in his fear"
1005,TO PURITY,He dreams you a eunuch carved of pallid stone

1015,TO PURITY,Or music on which fusillade the hoof-beats by
1016,TO PURITY,"Of screaming valkyr-steeds, to exalted strife!"
1017,TO PURITY,"You are love's seal and love's nobility,"
1018,TO PURITY,"And the burning flame, the aching flame of Life!"
1019,TO PURITY,
1020,TO PURITY,"Therefore, transfigurer of the flesh,--clear-shining"

1267,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,it was said that his soul could leave his body at will._)
1268,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,
1269,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,Early rose was the light
1270,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,As I sought the portico
1271,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,Whence her wings had fluttered in flight
1272,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,And with surge and flow
1273,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,"Had risen to soar, and go"
1274,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,"Out, out over the sea,"
1275,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,Dwindling white and soft and slow
1276,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,To a memory.
1277,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,
1278,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,"Oh, grief of all years to be!"
1279,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,Most miserable of men!
1280,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,"My throat ached with my tears,"
1281,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,As a sword driven through my ears
1282,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,Was my anguish then.
1283,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,
1284,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,Dark were the rooms where they lay
1285,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,Who loved in the flesh
1286,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,(Diana's disciples they said!)
1287,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,In that lupanar of the dead.
1288,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,"Sweet was the flesh they loved,"
1289,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,"Graceful the limbs that moved,"
1290,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,Wild the passion that they
1291,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,
1292,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,Desired afresh
1293,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,"In the night. Were they not of the world,"
1294,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,Of lust and toil and war?
1295,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,And I--I too?
1296,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,Yea--till that music swirled
1297,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,"About me, and I knew"
1298,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,I was visited of a star!
1299,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,
1300,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,A star it was grew and grew
1301,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,"(As hot in the dark I lay,"
1302,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,"Panting, after the feast,)"
1303,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,"Glorious out of the east,"
1304,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,And a face that made my soul
1305,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,"A slowly uncrumpling scroll,"
1306,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,It glimmered so near and fey!
1307,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,
1308,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,Her voice rippled like water
1309,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,In the light gold-green
1310,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,Of some mid-noon ravine.
1311,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,"She stooped, the moon's daughter,"
1312,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,With her hand underneath my head
1313,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,And her lips on the lips of the dead.
1314,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,I arose from my rumpled bed.
1315,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,
1316,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,A waterfall sliding green
1317,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,In a silver-mosaicked screen
1318,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,We two trod under;
1319,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,"Then I turned where her light touch led,"
1320,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,Trembling but unafraid.
1321,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,"Across some Elysian sod,"
1322,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,"Winged of heel, I floated--a god!--"
1323,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,"Down and into a moon-filled glade,"
1324,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,A glade of wonder....
1325,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,
1326,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,"But the east grew steadily bright,"
1327,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,A glaring sea of light.
1328,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,I throbbed to drums of dread.
1329,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,And my eyes still held her flight
1330,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,When she broke that dream with one kiss
1331,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,"Of agonizing bliss,"
1332,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,"Stood in streaming flame by my bed,"
1333,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,"Gestured, and fled."
1334,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,
1335,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,"Between the pillars I saw,"
1336,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,Beyond the pillars I heard
1337,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,Wings of no mortal bird
1338,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,Flare and withdraw.
1339,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,And they who had feasted and passioned
1340,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,"Slept, finding light no bar,"
1341,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,Slept in their bodies' ease.
1342,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,But under those rustling seas
1343,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,That lapped at the water-stair
1344,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,I ached to plunge my despair
1345,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,"And my heart, that some grim God fashioned"
1346,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,To be visited of a star!
1347,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,
1348,ARISTEAS RELATES HIS YOUTH,
1349,MAN POSSESSED,MAN POSSESSED
1350,MAN POSSESSED,
1351,MAN POSSESSED,"Shaken, a thousand times shaken, with the millions that grieve,"
1352,MAN POSSESSED,Now at last I am overtaken. I will say I believe.
1353,MAN POSSESSED,I ran with the pennons of morning astream over me.
1354,MAN POSSESSED,"On the precipice, scorning its warning, I ran to be free."
1355,MAN POSSESSED,"Still I love high winds and the great running and the steep verge,"
1356,MAN POSSESSED,"But strength past my strength overtakes my cunning, and stars emerge"
1357,MAN POSSESSED,"High over me, eternal, deathless, deep over deep,"
1358,MAN POSSESSED,"And my head sways heavy as I run breathless, my eyelids droop with"
1359,MAN POSSESSED,sleep.
1360,MAN POSSESSED,
1361,MAN POSSESSED,"Yet it is not this has shaken my soul in me,"
1362,MAN POSSESSED,"Not the bounds of life have overtaken my will to be free,"
1363,MAN POSSESSED,"But scent and sound past mete and bound, and a sign--a sign"
1364,MAN POSSESSED,"That no other eyes can recognize, that is only mine."
1365,MAN POSSESSED,I hardly know what I believe or what I mean
1366,MAN POSSESSED,Save there is sweetness round my heart and the world a screen
1367,MAN POSSESSED,Of interwoven mystery to a world unseen.
1368,MAN POSSESSED,
1369,MAN POSSESSED,"Can one drink the air, can one seize the sea, can one grasp the fire?"
1370,MAN POSSESSED,Even so intangible to me the answer to my desire.
1371,MAN POSSESSED,The elements we feel and see shift and drift and suspire
1372,MAN POSSESSED,"And we therein behind the screen, with glimmering brains that tire."
1373,MAN POSSESSED,That is all! Nor can I fall now in the race.
1374,MAN POSSESSED,As a second breath to a runner comes my soul takes up the pace--
1375,MAN POSSESSED,For I dreamed the world ran with me in a far and starry place.
1376,MAN POSSESSED,
1377,MAN POSSESSED,Gray as sea-mist driven were the shapes that strove
1378,MAN POSSESSED,With the strength of greed and hate and the greater strength of love.
1379,MAN POSSESSED,"I saw their eyes like phosphorus, blue fog about them wove."
1380,MAN POSSESSED,I saw the limbs glimmer and I heard the sighing come
1381,MAN POSSESSED,"From this side and from that, as our host ran dumb"
1382,MAN POSSESSED,"Over a silver shining plain, to some strange end, to some--"
1383,MAN POSSESSED,Was it goal or heaven or city?--some agonizing gleam
1384,MAN POSSESSED,That broke the heart for pity and made the eyes stream.
1385,MAN POSSESSED,"Above the pallor of that race our spent breath rose like steam,"
1386,MAN POSSESSED,"Yet our red hearts pulsed within us, as we ran, in my dream."
1387,MAN POSSESSED,
1388,MAN POSSESSED,A glow below the ghostly surf that swirled and surged and turned
1389,MAN POSSESSED,"Came from human hearts visible that throbbed and beat and burned,"
1390,MAN POSSESSED,And like sand of human ashes was the soil our feet spurned.
1391,MAN POSSESSED,"All the stars above us thronged the dome of space,"
1392,MAN POSSESSED,"Poised like javeliniers, with glinting spear or mace,"
1393,MAN POSSESSED,"Watchful of our running and to spoil our race,"
1394,MAN POSSESSED,"And all the souls that ran, ran with drawn and lifted face."
1395,MAN POSSESSED,
1396,MAN POSSESSED,This too was the real. I ran with dogged heart.
1397,MAN POSSESSED,"I parched like a desert, tortured in every part."
1398,MAN POSSESSED,I knew not what city--nor why the race should start.
1399,MAN POSSESSED,
1400,MAN POSSESSED,"Then a singing touched me, and the scent of a flower,"
1401,MAN POSSESSED,"A child's laugh, and the crying of a woman in her hour,"
1402,MAN POSSESSED,And a comrade's courage--and a subtle power
1403,MAN POSSESSED,"Not of worldly schemes and ways crept along my veins,"
1404,MAN POSSESSED,"And my heart went ablaze and consumed its many stains,"
1405,MAN POSSESSED,And my lips were touched with wine and my body felt no pains.
1406,MAN POSSESSED,Then it passed--and yet again it came and it passed--
1407,MAN POSSESSED,"Yet again and yet again, till I toiled at last"
1408,MAN POSSESSED,"In the old ironic torture, bound fast, bound fast."
1409,MAN POSSESSED,
1410,MAN POSSESSED,"But as I looked I saw how it came and went,"
1411,MAN POSSESSED,"That touch, that communion, almost inevident,"
1412,MAN POSSESSED,Through the host of these my brothers who ran nigh spent.
1413,MAN POSSESSED,When it came they ran like men with life and lung
1414,MAN POSSESSED,"And the wind went by them like a song bravely sung,"
1415,MAN POSSESSED,"Their hearts spread wide radiance, their limbs glowed young."
1416,MAN POSSESSED,"It passed, and they were phantoms with phantom arms that swung."
1417,MAN POSSESSED,
1418,MAN POSSESSED,Here and there a true form some spirit would endue
1419,MAN POSSESSED,"For moments, but we mortals were but ghosts I knew."
1420,MAN POSSESSED,Then a light low down before us to a distant landscape grew.
1421,MAN POSSESSED,The stars from heaven crowded down. I knew our race was through.
1422,MAN POSSESSED,The stars from heaven crowded down intolerably bright
1423,MAN POSSESSED,"With dizzying brilliance, height above armored height."
1424,MAN POSSESSED,Every star upcast a spear and hurled it down to smite.
1425,MAN POSSESSED,
1426,MAN POSSESSED,There was one strange thought in me. It echoed through my head
1427,MAN POSSESSED,"As some titanic corridor echoes a giant tread,"
1428,MAN POSSESSED,Only a little thing that my love once had said.
1429,MAN POSSESSED,"Common daily speech, a comforting word"
1430,MAN POSSESSED,"Tossed to me as lightly as crumbs to a bird,"
1431,MAN POSSESSED,"But it lived in my heart, it broke to flame and stirred"
1432,MAN POSSESSED,"My self to a purpose at last not self could mar,"
1433,MAN POSSESSED,"And I cried ""We are delivered!"" and I heard it echo far"
1434,MAN POSSESSED,Up to the vault of heaven past star on shrinking star.
1435,MAN POSSESSED,
1436,MAN POSSESSED,So then I was running through poppies that I knew
1437,MAN POSSESSED,Above a blue sea basking--and you--and you
1438,MAN POSSESSED,Were running on the headland in the world made anew.
1439,MAN POSSESSED,
1440,MAN POSSESSED,"I know some force is mighty, some force I cannot reach."
1441,MAN POSSESSED,I know that words are said to me that are not said with speech.
1442,MAN POSSESSED,My heart has learned a lesson that I can never teach.
1443,MAN POSSESSED,"Only this I know, that I am overtaken"
1444,MAN POSSESSED,"By a swifter runner Whose breath is never shaken,"
1445,MAN POSSESSED,"That I follow on His pace, and that round me, as I waken,"
1446,MAN POSSESSED,Are the headlands of home and the blue sea swinging
1447,MAN POSSESSED,And the flowers of the valleys their fresh scents flinging
1448,MAN POSSESSED,"And the prophets and the poets, with their singing--with their"
1449,MAN POSSESSED,singing!
1450,MAN POSSESSED,
1451,MAN POSSESSED,
1452,MINIATURE,MINIATURE
1453,MINIATURE,
1454,MINIATURE,"For all your gestures, for your gray-blue eyes"
1455,MINIATURE,"And Irish mouth, and hair that makes you child,"
1456,MINIATURE,When shaken out at evening; for your mirth
1457,MINIATURE,"And your quick pity, and your mother's breast;"
1458,MINIATURE,For the great tenderness that you have given
1459,MINIATURE,"And the rich dreams through purple-flowing night,"
1460,MINIATURE,The holy lull of effort and the peace
1461,MINIATURE,"Of a deep love; because of all these things,"
1462,MINIATURE,"Wherever I should be,--beyond what seas"
1463,MINIATURE,"Of an enchanted music, on what isles,"
1464,MINIATURE,"I know not, of a strange irradiance,"
1465,MINIATURE,"In dream or life or death,--dissatisfied"
1466,MINIATURE,"With splendor or white mystery, my heart"
1467,MINIATURE,Would break--my heart would break--never to hear
1468,MINIATURE,Your tones again or feel your hair again
1469,MINIATURE,"Beneath my lips, or see your lifted eyes"
1470,MINIATURE,Brimming with all the secrets of the stars!

1473,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR
1474,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,
1475,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"What in the night says the clock that ticks time to eternity,"
1476,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,Swimmer of waves of your thought that are dark waves and deep?
1477,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"What in the night says the moon, from her patient infinity,"
1478,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"Laying pale hands on your heart, hands of peace and of sleep?"
1479,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"What say the stars to her eyes, who has loosed by the window"
1480,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"The billow of her hair, as the dark of the trees feels her fear?"
1481,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"And over the cradle what whisper is breathing, is breathing."
1482,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"As over the bed of the bride or the catafalqued bier,"
1483,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,Or over the flung and clawed earth where a soldier is dying?
1484,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"""Death will make clear!"""
1485,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,
1486,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"Furious and fleet is man's soul, like a hound through the woodland,"
1487,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,On through the tangle of trees and the green and the gold.
1488,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"Yes, for the senses are goads, but the lineage noble,"
1489,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"Not for the warren or hutch to be cornered and sold,"
1490,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"Then there is freedom and ease, and a dream that persuades one"
1491,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"On, till the track quakes on black whence the death-lilies peer."
1492,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"So the bronzed shoulder, that sets to the crust of the boulder"
1493,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,Heaving it up--as the mill-wheel that turns at the weir--
1494,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,Bring--? They bring silence and candles and creaking and whispers.
1495,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,Death will make clear.
1496,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,
1497,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,Why that white work from the crag and the hands of the sculptor
1498,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,Smitten in a moment to rubble as earth heaves her breast?
1499,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"Why that intangible glory, remote but God-in-us,"
1500,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,Golden and crumbling to pathos of dusk in the west?
1501,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"Why the pure curve of the arm and the breast of a mother,"
1502,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"Yes, and the proud head of man held erect on the mere"
1503,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"Void of blue heaven,--the seas and the ships and the trumpets,"
1504,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"Towers and horizons, all shouting? The answer is here,"
1505,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"Here in thy breast, son of man, sorry son of the ages."
1506,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,Death will make clear.
1507,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,
1508,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"Lord of the mighty, as Lord of the weak and the lowly,"
1509,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"Lord of the sage and the madman, of clean and unclean;"
1510,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"Breeder of suns and of excrement, loathly and holy,"
1511,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"Graving the skull with the pity of all that had been,--"
1512,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"Death, oh thou graver of countenance knighted austerely,"
1513,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"Yea, on the pitiful clay, such poor flesh in its fear"
1514,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,Of God and the soul and the singing of stars that may teach us
1515,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,"Wisdom at last,--oh thou ultimate searcher and seer,"
1516,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,Beckon--I follow. At last on my lips set thy finger;
1517,DEATH WILL MAKE CLEAR,Thou wilt make clear!

1522,SUNLIGHT,Sunlight is full of age.
1523,SUNLIGHT,"Ah, so old!"
1524,SUNLIGHT,Older than any sage
1525,SUNLIGHT,Has ever told!
1526,SUNLIGHT,
1527,SUNLIGHT,The draught our Lord quaffed up
1528,SUNLIGHT,To the bloody lees;
1529,SUNLIGHT,The aching hemlock cup
1530,SUNLIGHT,Of Socrates.
1531,SUNLIGHT,
1532,SUNLIGHT,It is a golden sword;
1533,SUNLIGHT,The veil of the Grail;
1534,SUNLIGHT,The unfathomable Word
1535,SUNLIGHT,That will not fail.
1536,SUNLIGHT,
1537,SUNLIGHT,Along a summer street
1538,SUNLIGHT,It often lies
1539,SUNLIGHT,Shimmering to repeat
1540,SUNLIGHT,Immortal paradise.
1541,SUNLIGHT,
1542,SUNLIGHT,As a mountain lake can mirror
1543,SUNLIGHT,"The exalted with the near,"
1544,SUNLIGHT,Heaven's wonder and terror--
1545,SUNLIGHT,Both shine here.
1546,SUNLIGHT,
1547,SUNLIGHT,It says all things in nought;
1548,SUNLIGHT,"And, saying them, passes"
1549,SUNLIGHT,To gild like gentle thought
1550,SUNLIGHT,Trees and grasses.
1551,SUNLIGHT,
1552,SUNLIGHT,It sways upon the ocean
1553,SUNLIGHT,Like a god asleep
1554,SUNLIGHT,Where the waves' wandering motion
1555,SUNLIGHT,Hides the deep.
1556,SUNLIGHT,
1557,SUNLIGHT,It shafts through forest aisles
1558,SUNLIGHT,Like miracle;
1559,SUNLIGHT,It trembles and smiles
1560,SUNLIGHT,On the lip of Hell.
1561,SUNLIGHT,
1562,SUNLIGHT,It has touched Greece and Rome
1563,SUNLIGHT,And Persia's might--
1564,SUNLIGHT,And stirs the vines of home
1565,SUNLIGHT,With flickering light.
1566,SUNLIGHT,
1567,SUNLIGHT,It lay on Cain's hot neck
1568,SUNLIGHT,As he stooped to slay.
1569,SUNLIGHT,David's stone from the beck
1570,SUNLIGHT,Glittered its day.
1571,SUNLIGHT,
1572,SUNLIGHT,Cleopatra gazed upon it
1573,SUNLIGHT,Through shadowed lids.
1574,SUNLIGHT,High halls they built to shun it
1575,SUNLIGHT,In the Pyramids.
1576,SUNLIGHT,
1577,SUNLIGHT,It opens babies' hands
1578,SUNLIGHT,That crawl to snatch its beams.
1579,SUNLIGHT,Through hovels in ancient lands
1580,SUNLIGHT,Its splendor streams.
1581,SUNLIGHT,
1582,SUNLIGHT,Eternal wells of light
1583,SUNLIGHT,Its largeness shows.
1584,SUNLIGHT,There shall be no more night
1585,SUNLIGHT,Its conscience knows.
1586,SUNLIGHT,
1587,SUNLIGHT,"It is a smiling stranger,"
1588,SUNLIGHT,"A fainting hour,"
1589,SUNLIGHT,Love and peace and danger
1590,SUNLIGHT,And the mock of power.
1591,SUNLIGHT,
1592,SUNLIGHT,Yet have I said no word
1593,SUNLIGHT,Of what it is.
1594,SUNLIGHT,Only--my heart is stirred
1595,SUNLIGHT,By its mysteries!

1649,IN TIME OF TROUBLE,
1650,IN TIME OF TROUBLE,In memory of your desolate eyes I know
1651,IN TIME OF TROUBLE,"That words are words, with nothing to gainsay"
1652,IN TIME OF TROUBLE,"The testimony of pain, the heavy day;"
1653,IN TIME OF TROUBLE,But searching in the ruins of overthrow
1654,IN TIME OF TROUBLE,I gathered you this wreath that now I show;
1655,IN TIME OF TROUBLE,"Small and barbaric brightness on the gray,--"
1656,IN TIME OF TROUBLE,"Glimmering irony, perhaps. I lay"
1657,IN TIME OF TROUBLE,"It down before your eyes, and softly go."
1658,IN TIME OF TROUBLE,
1659,IN TIME OF TROUBLE,You are a vista blundered on in Arden
1660,IN TIME OF TROUBLE,"Where the fool grasps his bells, that he may hark;"
1661,IN TIME OF TROUBLE,A sudden skyward path where cliffs are warden
1662,IN TIME OF TROUBLE,Of waves that foam to reach a high tide-mark;
1663,IN TIME OF TROUBLE,Whisper of blossoms in a midnight garden;
1664,IN TIME OF TROUBLE,A fountain whitely flowering on the dark.

1674,ANOMALY,"Casting the stole for spangled domino,"

1679,ANOMALY,"And spread and fade,--and working out what end?"
1680,ANOMALY,In time of pain why be as voluble
1681,ANOMALY,"As one who tells an endless useless sum,"

1750,THE PALE DANCER,
1751,THE PALE DANCER,She comes like a breeze in the midnight of May.
1752,THE PALE DANCER,The tumbling of the seas makes a tune far away.
1753,THE PALE DANCER,"She comes with closed eyes, with light footsteps she nears,"
1754,THE PALE DANCER,And she sings the low song that each lipping ripple hears.
1755,THE PALE DANCER,"""In love there is laughter, and after--come tears!"""
1756,THE PALE DANCER,
1757,THE PALE DANCER,"She dances like the moonlight--light, languorous, aswoon."

1781,PREMONITION,
1782,PREMONITION,This is the song I shall make.
1783,PREMONITION,Love with white wing bids it wake.
1784,PREMONITION,Love with dark wing bids it die.
1785,PREMONITION,"Trailing to dimness, the flood of my passion,"
1786,PREMONITION,"Glittering to darkness, the necklace I fashion"
1787,PREMONITION,To loop on the breast of the sky!
1788,PREMONITION,
1789,PREMONITION,"I have climbed high, even I,"
1790,PREMONITION,"Following a light through a rift in the blue,"
1791,PREMONITION,"Following a silence that pierced like a cry,"
1792,PREMONITION,Following the image of you.
1793,PREMONITION,
1794,PREMONITION,This is the song I will fashion for you.
1795,PREMONITION,
1796,PREMONITION,"Oh ragged-jawed, jagged-toothed Dragon of Time,"
1797,PREMONITION,"What will you do with the weft of my rhyme,"

1799,PREMONITION,_You!_
1800,PREMONITION,
1801,PREMONITION,"No, in this space between darkness and light,"
1802,PREMONITION,Holiness gleams like a rift in the night
1803,PREMONITION,"Here where I stand and command the full height,"
1804,PREMONITION,All of the glory and gall ...
1805,PREMONITION,Wrestle and struggle and surge for the height--
1806,PREMONITION,And fall....
1807,PREMONITION,
1808,PREMONITION,"Pain, your pale hands are clenched loose in my hair."
1809,PREMONITION,My heaving breast to your bleakness is bare.
1810,PREMONITION,"Each of the other as brothers aware,"
1811,PREMONITION,Backward and forward we strain.
1812,PREMONITION,"What is this struggle, why my despair,"
1813,PREMONITION,Pain?
1814,PREMONITION,
1815,PREMONITION,God is somewhere in the night.
1816,PREMONITION,Listen! The night is so still
1817,PREMONITION,God could be heard if he walked on the height
1818,PREMONITION,As a man at night will walk on a hill
1819,PREMONITION,Lulled by the darkness and dim.
1820,PREMONITION,Heaven is the hill under Him.
1821,PREMONITION,Is there not glimmer of light at its rim?
1822,PREMONITION,
1823,PREMONITION,Pain? Ah the struggle again.
1824,PREMONITION,"Drive then your darts in me, drive!"
1825,PREMONITION,"Pang after pang of it, Pain."
1826,PREMONITION,Wounds that will wake me alive.
1827,PREMONITION,Listen! The night is a hive
1828,PREMONITION,Of sound like a swarming of myriad bees.
1829,PREMONITION,"Drive the gold darts in me, whet them and drive,"
1830,PREMONITION,Pain! But his shadow flees.
1831,PREMONITION,"What is this plain, whose these shapes that connive"
1832,PREMONITION,Peace?
1833,PREMONITION,
1834,PREMONITION,Peace? But your garment is smirched
1835,PREMONITION,With grime and the stain of blood!
1836,PREMONITION,"Peace! When I struggled and searched,"
1837,PREMONITION,"Ah, when have I understood?"
1838,PREMONITION,"I who was broken and spent,"
1839,PREMONITION,"I who was baffled, and meant"
1840,PREMONITION,Only to wrench my release!
1841,PREMONITION,
1842,PREMONITION,"Who are Those crouching behind you, so still and intent,"
1843,PREMONITION,Peace?
1844,PREMONITION,
1845,PREMONITION,Memories? Why do they haunt?
1846,PREMONITION,Lust and vainglory and pride?
1847,PREMONITION,What is it now of my victory they want?
1848,PREMONITION,"What of you, Peace, the crucified?"
1849,PREMONITION,This is the height. Can they scan it?
1850,PREMONITION,This is no space-festering planet.
1851,PREMONITION,This is no rack of vain tears!
1852,PREMONITION,"Even a dream, can they cloud it and ban it,--"
1853,PREMONITION,Fears?
1854,PREMONITION,
1855,PREMONITION,"Years go over me, cloud me and cover me,"
1856,PREMONITION,Years--haunted years.
1857,PREMONITION,
1858,PREMONITION,Only one thing I say over and over
1859,PREMONITION,Under that catafalque glooming to cover
1860,PREMONITION,My shame and disaster and wraith of faith.
1861,PREMONITION,"Only one thing I say over and over,"
1862,PREMONITION,"Your name, said under my breath."
1863,PREMONITION,
1864,PREMONITION,"There, like a storm on the sea line, you hover,"
1865,PREMONITION,Death!
1866,PREMONITION,
1867,PREMONITION,Ripples and eddies and whirlpools of light
1868,PREMONITION,Swirling like veils on the face of the night.
1869,PREMONITION,"Down from the infinite, down from the height"
1870,PREMONITION,"Stricken and whirled,"
1871,PREMONITION,Swept like a leaf on the blast of the night
1872,PREMONITION,Back to the world!
1873,PREMONITION,
1874,PREMONITION,Breathing beside me--your breath!
1875,PREMONITION,Listen! The night is so still
1876,PREMONITION,God could be heard if he talked with Death
1877,PREMONITION,As a man at night might talk on a hill
1878,PREMONITION,Gently and sad to a friend
1879,PREMONITION,Of the things we always intend ...
1880,PREMONITION,Night without end for Him--_night without end_...!
1881,PREMONITION,
1882,PREMONITION,This is the song I have made
1883,PREMONITION,"Of the night when I was afraid,"
1884,PREMONITION,"Of the night too breathless, too still,"
1885,PREMONITION,"When I lay like stone--alone--alone,"
1886,PREMONITION,However near me the love we kill.
1887,PREMONITION,What of the love we kill?
1888,PREMONITION,
1889,PREMONITION,Pride that died and darkness that grew!
1890,PREMONITION,This is the song I began to wreathe ...
1891,PREMONITION,"Ah, but God remembered,--it is not true!"
1892,PREMONITION,"_And you--you live, you breathe!_"

1901,I,I
1902,I,
1903,I,On Sunday in the sunlight
1904,I,With brightness round her strown
1905,I,And murmuring beauty of the sky
1906,I,"At last her very own,"
1907,I,She who had loved all children
1908,I,And all high things and clean
1909,I,Turned away to silentness
1910,I,And bliss unseen.
1911,I,
1912,I,"Rending, blinding anguish,"
1913,I,Is all a man can know;
1914,I,Yet still I kneel beside her
1915,I,"For she would have it so,"
1916,I,Kneel and pray beside her
1917,I,In light she left behind--
1918,I,"Light and love in silentness,"
1919,I,Sight to the blind.
1920,I,
1921,I,Oh living light burn through me!
1922,I,"Oh speak, as spoke to me"
1923,I,"Her deep sweet eyes and faithful,"
1924,I,Voice on Calvary!
1925,I,"Oh light be near and shining,"
1926,I,"Nearer than I guess,"
1927,I,And teach me that true language
1928,I,Of silentness!

1931,II,II
1932,II,
1933,II,If now I fall away
1934,II,"From faith, may never day"
1935,II,Shine as it shone
1936,II,With inmost sanctities
1937,II,Of those sun-glittering trees--
1938,II,We two alone.
1939,II,
1940,II,The darkness toils and heaves.
1941,II,The Wood of Glittering Leaves
1942,II,"You gave--you gave,"
1943,II,"Dearest in life and death,"
1944,II,"Dearest with every breath,"
1945,II,Lamp of the brave!
1946,II,
1947,II,"You came in sunlight, still"
1948,II,"As God, with Whom your will"
1949,II,Was always one.
1950,II,"You knew me, and you knew"
1951,II,I read your presence through
1952,II,That sacred sun.
1953,II,
1954,II,"League upon league of light,"
1955,II,"As the train raced the night,"
1956,II,"With night on me,"
1957,II,With pain that gripped and wrung
1958,II,"As the cars clashed and swung,--"
1959,II,I yet could see
1960,II,
1961,II,The slim trees of that wood
1962,II,"Brighter than tears or blood,"
1963,II,Fairy with day;
1964,II,"That dark marsh land made bright,"
1965,II,"Veiled in miraculous light,--"
1966,II,Your way!
1967,II,
1968,II,I hold it fast. I hold
1969,II,"All that mysterious gold,"
1970,II,All that it weaves
1971,II,Of Heaven to understand--
1972,II,Our radiant bridal land
1973,II,Of glittering leaves.

1982,III,Nothing in this life gives to you and me
1983,III,"Such a sunlight-shod,"
1984,III,Sunlight-crowned delight in our memory
1985,III,As was given.
1986,III,
1987,III,There was not a harm in these roaring hours
1988,III,That could touch Her head
1989,III,Perfect was Her charm borne against the powers
1990,III,Gnashing still.
1991,III,In her heart a field laughed with golden flowers
1992,III,Where Her soul could tread.
1993,III,"Swift, serene, she passed all that snarls and cowers,"
1994,III,White of will.
1995,III,
1996,III,Song can give her nothing. We who brave the night
1997,III,Say Her name again
1998,III,Raise it like a cup full of sacred light
1999,III,Up to Heaven.
2000,III,"Now we know our pain blinding, burning bright"
2001,III,In the world of men.
2002,III,"Yet we know our joy, knowing now aright"

2007,IV,
2008,IV,"Base rewards and glamours, the beating tide of hours,"
2009,IV,The crying and clamors and the surge of silent powers
2010,IV,Pass me and pass me now. Silently I go
2011,IV,"The one road, the only road I know."
2012,IV,
2013,IV,"Oh, bare and bright as dreams"
2014,IV,And laced with silver streams
2015,IV,"Lies the land on either hand, past the darkness and dread."
2016,IV,"Though a man must grip his soul lest it start from all control,"
2017,IV,And must bow his head.
2018,IV,
2019,IV,Where are your footprints on air that I may find them?
2020,IV,Where your radiant garments that I may hide behind them?
2021,IV,"No, it is my own road, straight and black"
2022,IV,That turns not back.
2023,IV,
2024,IV,I will search till the darkness sears on either hand
2025,IV,"With the drifting sparkles of some fiery brand,"
2026,IV,Of some pain that lights me nearer to the land of your endeavor.
2027,IV,I will search forever.
2028,IV,
2029,IV,"The torrent of the hours like a veil veiling heaven,"
2030,IV,The war with bitter powers--I am given.
2031,IV,"But light that you left me--light, your own decision,"
2032,IV,Your secret and your vision.
2033,IV,
2034,IV,Time? What is Time now. Standing to the thong
2035,IV,"And the dream that is passing, time is not long."
2036,IV,"And I shall find the valley past the mountains that defeat me,"

2043,V,"In dream across the sea, across the murmurous sea;"
2044,V,Not beauty that has passed or crowns the stars were wearing
2045,V,Or flame that fierce and fast through darkness hunted me;
2046,V,"Not the frustrate desire, the web of memory broken,"
2047,V,The silence where your speech dizzies through all the air;
2048,V,Not these elude my reach when the dark hours have spoken
2049,V,"As does that priceless token, your soul of passionate prayer."
2050,V,
2051,V,"Oh race that falters on, the striving and the stricken"
2052,V,Passing with fruits and garlands and dust upon the head;
2053,V,Oh burning sunset gone wherein was hope to quicken
2054,V,The surge of starry dawn rising above the dead;
2055,V,"Oh clamor over shame, yoke of the little-wiser"
2056,V,"On the unwilling shoulders, clenched by the quivering hands;"
2057,V,Patience and proof that were and are your still appriser
2058,V,"Now veil her and disguise her, gone from the spectral lands."
2059,V,
2060,V,"The spectral lands of time, the eternal torrent pouring"
2061,V,"Of dark and light around us, who fear both dark and light;"
2062,V,"And grief that wails in rhyme, and flesh the soul abhorring,"
2063,V,And dismal pantomine played on a stage moon-bright;
2064,V,"Why should such things as these assail her happy meadow,"
2065,V,"Creep on the court of children, come crying through the shine?"
2066,V,We who are too unskilled even to taunt the shadow
2067,V,Groan only in the darkness and spill the precious wine!
2068,V,
2069,V,"For round us beating, beating her wings are in the mirror"
2070,V,"Of sleep, the mirror of silence built up with perilous breath."
2071,V,And in our conscience meeting her smile is on the terror
2072,V,That chains us round with error and desperate fear of death;
2073,V,Kind as a child's small hands her faithfulness is round us
2074,V,"With swift and fading gestures, wise as a child is wise;"
2075,V,"Out of the gathering clouds that curtain and confound us,"
2076,V,"Ecstasy and enchantment--sudden and swift, her eyes!"
2077,V,
2078,V,"The hills shall lay away their sombreness unspoken,"
2079,V,"The seas shall hush their murmur, the saddened wind be still,"
2080,V,When the long league of silence 'twixt earth and beast is broken
2081,V,When at the end of all things the stones speak on the hill.
2082,V,"Then Calvary shall cry with glorious joy to heaven,"
2083,V,"Aceldama be hearkened and purged by words aware,--"
2084,V,"For that in days gone by her voice to His was given,"
2085,V,And to the joy of heaven her soul of passionate prayer.

2089,VI,
2090,VI,I listened to the wind who speaks of finding
2091,VI,Among the litter of his blown leaves of days
2092,VI,All rainbow gold of tears that are so blinding;
2093,VI,And then again he says
2094,VI,"Something of glittering jewels in the haze,"
2095,VI,"Incense of praise, myrtles and bays for binding"
2096,VI,The wounds that blossom blood upon his ways.
2097,VI,
2098,VI,I listened to the sun who can recover
2099,VI,Miraculous instants of an earlier time
2100,VI,Surprise Her eyes alinger on her lover
2101,VI,And run like rhyme
2102,VI,On leaf and stream. He spoke of dream and clime
2103,VI,"Sacred with everlasting Spring, ahover"
2104,VI,With light more cadenced than bright bells in chime.
2105,VI,
2106,VI,"I listened to the earth and sea. Their voices,"
2107,VI,"Too mixed with men, came sombrer and more sad."
2108,VI,They droned awhile of all the tangled choices
2109,VI,"That every man has had,"
2110,VI,And moaned like ancients with mere age gone mad
2111,VI,And left me nothing that reasons or rejoices--
2112,VI,That seemed so reasonless in being glad.
2113,VI,
2114,VI,I listened starward where the ghostly weaving
2115,VI,Of wandering lights is all of Heaven we know
2116,VI,And worlds are lamps and darkness comes bereaving
2117,VI,"The world of ebb and flow,"
2118,VI,And 'tis as if a bosom were heaving slow
2119,VI,"With firmamental care,--ah, heaving, heaving"
2120,VI,With an unfathomable earlier woe.
2121,VI,
2122,VI,"""Listener at many doors,--for what disaster?--"""
2123,VI,Her spirit murmur crept into my ears.
2124,VI,"""Brooder on pictures breathed on by the Master,"
2125,VI,"Listen at the heart that hears,--"
2126,VI,"Ah, listen softly, breathing low!"" The years"
2127,VI,"Were not--for there She was--and, gazing past her,"
2128,VI,I saw the Vision raised by blood and tears.
2129,VI,
2130,VI,
2131,VII,VII
2132,VII,
2133,VII,"For the eyes loved,"
2134,VII,For the face lifted
2135,VII,"In that still light,"
2136,VII,"Dark trees are groved,"
2137,VII,"The snow drifted,"
2138,VII,And the mound white.
2139,VII,
2140,VII,And the grave dug
2141,VII,And the words spoken
2142,VII,And the flowers shed--
2143,VII,And the eyes tearless
2144,VII,But the heart broken
2145,VII,For the brave dead.
2146,VII,
2147,VII,Though a soul thrill
2148,VII,To the stars' fire
2149,VII,And a mind sing
2150,VII,To a keen will
2151,VII,Of a high desire
2152,VII,"And a great thing,--"
2153,VII,
2154,VII,"Ah, who listens?"
2155,VII,Who--who hearkens
2156,VII,"Or answer makes,--"
2157,VII,Though the moon glistens
2158,VII,And the night darkens
2159,VII,And the heart breaks?
2160,VII,
2161,VII,"Lay her sword by her,"
2162,VII,"Her steel of spirit,"
2163,VII,"Her phantom blade,"
2164,VII,Lest the loud liar
2165,VII,In his hell inherit
2166,VII,What her soul made!
2167,VII,
2168,VII,"Sweet sword, she came"
2169,VII,To pierce and quicken
2170,VII,"My heart to grace,--"
2171,VII,"Oh, white flame,"
2172,VII,"Oh, heart life-stricken,"
2173,VII,"Oh, deathless face!"

2177,VIII,
2178,VIII,Now the snow drives. The day
2179,VIII,Goes on in whirling gray.
2180,VIII,"Still the world roars,"
2181,VIII,As if no striving flame
2182,VIII,"Had gone, as it suddenly came,"
2183,VIII,Passing blind doors;
2184,VIII,
2185,VIII,"As if no eyes, no smile,"
2186,VIII,No heart that could beguile
2187,VIII,"Evil from earth,"
2188,VIII,Had hovered just a space
2189,VIII,To light one holy place
2190,VIII,In the dark and the dearth.
2191,VIII,
2192,VIII,Was it always as fierce and strange--
2193,VIII,This blank and sudden change
2194,VIII,Men have known ever?
2195,VIII,This veil as hard and keen
2196,VIII,As the blade of a guillotine
2197,VIII,Flashing to sever?
2198,VIII,
2199,VIII,"Oh, ears that hark in the night,"
2200,VIII,"Eyeballs that strain for sight,"
2201,VIII,Pulses that know
2202,VIII,"The same dull burning ache,"
2203,VIII,"Though a man sleep, though he wake,--"

2209,IX,True love runs wild and wildly understands.
2210,IX,I took the bread of Heaven once from your two hands.
2211,IX,"And your eyes are upon me even as I sing,"
2212,IX,"Saying, ""Be of comfort. Death is a little thing."""
2213,IX,
2214,IX,"Oh, magic child and woman, who crept into my heart,"
2215,IX,Who hold me with strong arms from all the world apart--
2216,IX,"No, I will not say it--for your eyes grieve;"
2217,IX,"I will say you draw us all to Heaven--_your_ Heaven, by your"
2218,IX,leave!
2219,IX,
2220,IX,"Lady Simplicitas, who hummed like any bee"
2221,IX,"Little quaint and olden rhymes to keep simplicity,"
2222,IX,"Lady of the downcast eyes and sudden starry mirth,"
2223,IX,"And eloquence by torchlight for the wronged of all the earth,"
2224,IX,
2225,IX,True love runs wild and wildly understands!
2226,IX,I took the wine of Heaven once from your two hands;
2227,IX,And when your eyes were darkened for the world's red smart
2228,IX,You made a violet twilight as you pressed against my heart.
2229,IX,
2230,IX,"For that coiled hair's brown crown, for that sweet and seemly way,"
2231,IX,"The straight thoughts, the eager words, the dazzle of your day,"
2232,IX,Shall I turn base then and learn to whine and curse?
2233,IX,Not though daggers of memory flicker through this verse!
2234,IX,
2235,IX,For true love runs wild and wildly understands.
2236,IX,I took the sacrament of love from your two hands.
2237,IX,So shall I cross the sunset hill and climb the pasture bars
2238,IX,"And meet you in our porch at last, in the Village of the Stars."

2246,X,Hold one love true.
2247,X,Who but hears the querulous
2248,X,"Sigh and the heavy groan,--"
2249,X,"Yet stand for the one love perilous,"
2250,X,Though you stand alone.
2251,X,
2252,X,"Yes, and though beaten and beaten"
2253,X,By the ravings of the blood;
2254,X,"Though with dust and ashes eaten,"
2255,X,Be one thing understood.
2256,X,"The battle in the cloud overthrows you,"
2257,X,"Your lips are dashed with foam,--"
2258,X,Yet the one love lives and knows you
2259,X,And leads you home.
2260,X,
2261,X,"Home--ah, God!--to the slumber"
2262,X,"At last and the waking peace,"
2263,X,Where wars without name or number
2264,X,Give last release;
2265,X,Where her whisper again is more to you
2266,X,"Than the angels' flaming wars,"
2267,X,And proud Death's hands can pour to you
2268,X,The cold of the stars.
2269,X,

2272,XI,
2273,XI,The selfishness of grief! ... and yet each turning
2274,XI,And questing after some new brave relief
2275,XI,Shows other steel stretched forth and on me burning
2276,XI,The selfishness of grief.
2277,XI,
2278,XI,"Till self who was my God and love, my chief,"
2279,XI,Even these turn from my side with footsteps spurning
2280,XI,"As, stooping low, I lift the heavy sheaf"
2281,XI,
2282,XI,"Of our flowered hours gathered with our yearning,"
2283,XI,Gathered so wildly in our happy fief
2284,XI,"And glimmering beautiful beyond belief,"
2285,XI,"With dazing fragrance, till my dim discerning"
2286,XI,Sees them the legend dropped for my unlearning
2287,XI,The selfishness of grief!

2966,THE RETREAT,
2967,THE RETREAT,To see me stained and torn
2968,THE RETREAT,And travel-worn
2969,THE RETREAT,But yet with all my love of you held fast;
2970,THE RETREAT,"And wonder ""Is it he?"" and know it is--"
2971,THE RETREAT,All mysteries
2972,THE RETREAT,Being outdone by this mysterious last.
2973,THE RETREAT,
2974,THE RETREAT,And as the evening glows
2975,THE RETREAT,In throbbing rose
2976,THE RETREAT,"May you lift your arms then, lift your head and cry"
2977,THE RETREAT,"""Come!""--and yet sleep not wake"
2978,THE RETREAT,Nor dreaming break--
2979,THE RETREAT,"But light forever fold us, you and I."
2980,THE RETREAT,
2981,THE RETREAT,
2982,SEALED,SEALED
2983,SEALED,
2984,SEALED,Man has been famed
2985,SEALED,Time out of mind
2986,SEALED,For having gone lamed
2987,SEALED,Or deaf or blind
2988,SEALED,Or weighted down
2989,SEALED,With loads that bind.
2990,SEALED,
2991,SEALED,And eye and ear
2992,SEALED,Now curtained are
2993,SEALED,To see or hear
2994,SEALED,Rhyme in a star
2995,SEALED,"Since you, my dear,"
2996,SEALED,Have gone so far.
2997,SEALED,
2998,SEALED,And limbs that go
2999,SEALED,And lips that speak
3000,SEALED,Are not to know
3001,SEALED,That which they seek....
3002,SEALED,Does Time jest so
3003,SEALED,In a madman's freak?
3004,SEALED,
3005,SEALED,"No, Time jests not,"
3006,SEALED,Nor have I guessed
3007,SEALED,What has overshot
3008,SEALED,All bitter jest
3009,SEALED,Since first Man got
3010,SEALED,Fate's manifest.
3011,SEALED,
3012,SEALED,Cold eyes averse
3013,SEALED,And stony brows
3014,SEALED,And the old curse
3015,SEALED,On Adam's house
3016,SEALED,"Despite, my verse"
3017,SEALED,This truth allows:
3018,SEALED,
3019,SEALED,"A clear light hidden,"
3020,SEALED,"A tower of air,"
3021,SEALED,"A voice unbidden,"
3022,SEALED,"A secret stair,"
3023,SEALED,And dream long-chidden
3024,SEALED,That makes aware
3025,SEALED,
3026,SEALED,Thought of a time--
3027,SEALED,Who shall say how?
3028,SEALED,"Oh, burnished grime,"
3029,SEALED,"Star-studded plough,"
3030,SEALED,Common coin of rhyme
3031,SEALED,Ringing golden now!
3032,SEALED,
3033,THE END,THE END
3034,THE END,
3035,THE END,
3036,THE END,
3037,THE END,
3038,THE END,
