2194,NOTES,"Jeanne d’Arc is said to have led a Scottish force at Lagny, when she"
2195,NOTES,"defeated the Burgundian, Franquet d’Arras.  A Scottish artist painted her"

2200,NOTES,Unluckily his manuscript breaks off in the middle of a sentence.  At her

2202,NOTES,in the hands of a Scottish archer.  The story of the white dove which
2203,NOTES,passed from her lips as they opened to her last cry of _Jesus_! was
2204,NOTES,reported at the trial for her Rehabilitation (1450–56).
