11,THE SLEEP,THE SLEEP 
12,THE SLEEP,"OF all the thoughts of God that are Borne inward unto souls afar, Along the Psalmist's music deep, Now tell me if that any is, For gift or grace, surpassing this-- 'He giveth His beloved, sleep'! "
13,THE SLEEP,"What would we give to our beloved? The hero's heart to be unmoved, The poet's star-tuned harp, to sweep, The patriot's voice, to teach and rouse, The monarch's crown, to light the brows? 'He giveth His beloved sleep.' "
14,THE SLEEP,[Illustration: Along the Psalmist's music deep] 
15,THE SLEEP,"What do we give to our beloved? A little faith all undisproved, A little dust to overweep, And bitter memories to make The whole earth blasted for our sake. He giveth His beloved sleep. "
16,THE SLEEP,[Illustration: A little dust to overweep] 
17,THE SLEEP,"""Sleep soft, beloved!"" we sometimes say, But have no tune to charm away Sad dreams that through the eyelids creep. But never doleful dream again Shall break the happy slumber when He giveth His beloved sleep. "
18,THE SLEEP,[Illustration: Sad dreams that through the eyelids creep But never doleful dream agains Shall break the happy slumber] 
19,THE SLEEP,"O earth, so full of dreary noises! O men, with wailing in your voices! O delv√®d gold, the wailers heap! O strife, O curse, that o'er it fall! God strikes a silence through you all, He giveth His beloved sleep. "
20,THE SLEEP,[Illustration: Oh men with wailing in your voices] 
21,THE SLEEP,"His dews drop mutely on the hill; His cloud above it saileth still, Though on its slope men sow and reap. More softly than the dew is shed, Or cloud is floated overhead, He giveth His beloved sleep. "
22,THE SLEEP,[Illustration: Though on its slope men sow and reap] 
23,THE SLEEP,"Ay, men may wonder while they scan A living, thinking, feeling man, Confirmed in such a rest to keep; But angels say, and through the word I think their happy smile is _heard_,-- 'He giveth His beloved sleep.' "
24,THE SLEEP,[Illustration: And through the word I think their happy smile is heard] 
25,THE SLEEP,"For me, my heart that erst did go Most like a tired child at a show, That sees through tears the mummers leap, Would now its wearied vision close, Would childlike on His love repose, Who giveth His beloved sleep. "
26,THE SLEEP,[Illustration: Like a tired child at a show] 
27,THE SLEEP,"And, friends, dear friends,--when it shall be That this low breath is gone from me, And round my bier ye come to weep, Let one, most loving of you all, Say, ""Not a tear must o'er her fall-- 'He giveth His beloved sleep.'"" "
