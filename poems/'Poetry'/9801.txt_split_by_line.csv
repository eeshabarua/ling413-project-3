45,INTRODUCTION,"On me demande, pour ce charmant volume, un mot de préface en français;"
46,INTRODUCTION,le voici:
47,INTRODUCTION,
48,INTRODUCTION,"Quand, en 1863, je publiai mon premier recueil de poésies--écrites au"
49,INTRODUCTION,"collège, pour la plupart,--le grand poète américain Longfellow eut la"
50,INTRODUCTION,flatteuse bienveillance de m'appeler _The pathfinder of a new land of
51,INTRODUCTION,song_.
52,INTRODUCTION,
53,INTRODUCTION,Avec mille fois plus de raison puis-je aujourd'hui passer le compliment
54,INTRODUCTION,"à mon sympathique confrère et ami, l'auteur de ce livre; car, si jamais"
55,INTRODUCTION,"quelqu'un, chez nous, a mérité le titre de _pathfinder of a new land of"
56,INTRODUCTION,"song_, c'est assurément lui."
57,INTRODUCTION,
58,INTRODUCTION,"Non seulement il a découvert le champ, la clairière, la vallée fertile"
59,INTRODUCTION,"et encore inexplorée; il en a fait l'exploitation à sa manière, avec"
60,INTRODUCTION,"des outils et des moyens de son invention; et, fier de sa conquête,"
61,INTRODUCTION,"il laisse, de son épaule robuste, tomber à nos pieds le fruit de son"
62,INTRODUCTION,"travail, la gerbe plantureuse aux ors vierges, à l'arôme sauvage,"
63,INTRODUCTION,"aux savoureuses promesses, toute fraîche et toute crissante dans sa"
64,INTRODUCTION,rusticité saine.
65,INTRODUCTION,
66,INTRODUCTION,"N'est-elle pas, en effet, d'une originalité peu commune, l'idée de"
67,INTRODUCTION,"prendre un pauvre illettré, de le présenter comme un type national à"
68,INTRODUCTION,"part, de lui mettre aux lèvres une langue qui n'est pas la sienne et"
69,INTRODUCTION,qu'il ne connaît qu' à demi; d'en faire en même temps un personnage
70,INTRODUCTION,"bon, doux, aimable, honnête, intelligent et droit, l'esprit en éveil, le"
71,INTRODUCTION,"coeur plein d'une poésie native stimulant son patriotisme, jetant un"
72,INTRODUCTION,"rayon lumineux dans son modeste intérieur, berçant ses heures rêveuses"
73,INTRODUCTION,de souvenirs lointains et mélancoliques?
74,INTRODUCTION,
75,INTRODUCTION,"Et cela sans que jamais, dans ce portrait d'un nouveau genre, le plus"
76,INTRODUCTION,subtil des critiques puisse surprendre nulle part le coup de crayon
77,INTRODUCTION,de la caricature!
78,INTRODUCTION,
79,INTRODUCTION,"Dans ses inimitables contes villageois, George Sand a peint les"
80,INTRODUCTION,paysans du Berry sous des dehors très intéressants. Elle nous les
81,INTRODUCTION,montre même d'un sentiment très affiné dans leur simplicité naïve
82,INTRODUCTION,"et leur cordiale bonhomie. En somme, elle en fait des natures, des"
83,INTRODUCTION,"tempéraments, quelque chose de typique, en même temps qu' harmonieux"
84,INTRODUCTION,de teinte et de forme.
85,INTRODUCTION,
86,INTRODUCTION,Mais George Sand faisait parler ses personnages dans la langue du
87,INTRODUCTION,"pays, dans la langue de la chaumière, dans leur propre dialecte,"
88,INTRODUCTION,"enfin. Elle n'avait, pour ainsi dire, qu' à faire pénétrer le"
89,INTRODUCTION,"souffle de son talent sous le réseau de la phrase, pour animer"
90,INTRODUCTION,celle-ci d'un reflet de lyrisme ou d'une vibration attendrie.
91,INTRODUCTION,
92,INTRODUCTION,La tâche abordée par M. Drummond présentait un caractère beaucoup
93,INTRODUCTION,plus difficile.
94,INTRODUCTION,
95,INTRODUCTION,"Ici, le poète avait bien, il est vrai, le milieu à saisir, placé,"
96,INTRODUCTION,droit en face de son objectif. Il était assez familier avec ses
97,INTRODUCTION,"acteurs pour les grouper avantageusement, en ménageant les effets"
98,INTRODUCTION,d'ombres et de lumière. Il est naturellement assez artiste pour ne
99,INTRODUCTION,"rien négliger de ce qui ajoute du pittoresque à la pose; surtout, il"
100,INTRODUCTION,"connaissait à fond le type à reproduire, ses moeurs, ses passions,"
101,INTRODUCTION,"ses sentiments, ses penchants, ses superstitions et ses faiblesses."
102,INTRODUCTION,
103,INTRODUCTION,"Mais comment, sans tomber dans la charge ou la bouffonnerie, faire"
104,INTRODUCTION,"parler systématiquement à ses personnages une langue étrangère,"
105,INTRODUCTION,forcément incorrecte dans la bouche de quelqu'un qui l'a apprise
106,INTRODUCTION,"par oreille, sans savoir lire même dans sa propre langue?"
107,INTRODUCTION,
108,INTRODUCTION,La tentative était hardie; mais on sait que le succès a un faible
109,INTRODUCTION,pour les audacieux.
110,INTRODUCTION,
111,INTRODUCTION,"Dans son étude des Canadiens-français, M. Drummond a trouvé le moyen"
112,INTRODUCTION,d'éviter un écueil qui aurait semblé inévitable pour tout autre
113,INTRODUCTION,"que pour lui. Il est resté vrai, sans tomber dans la vulgarité, et"
114,INTRODUCTION,piquant sans verser dans le grotesque.
115,INTRODUCTION,
116,INTRODUCTION,Qu'il mette en scène le gros fermier fier de son bien ou de ses
117,INTRODUCTION,"filles à marier, le vieux médecin de campagne ne comptant plus ses"
118,INTRODUCTION,"états de service, le jeune amoureux qui rêve au clair de la lune,"
119,INTRODUCTION,le vieillard qui repasse en sa mémoire la longue suite des jours
120,INTRODUCTION,"révolus, le conteur de légendes, l'aventurier des ""pays d'en haut,"""
121,INTRODUCTION,"et même le Canadien exilé--le _Canadien errant_, comme dit la"
122,INTRODUCTION,chanson populaire--qui croit toujours entendre résonner à son
123,INTRODUCTION,oreille le vague tintement des cloches de son village; que le récit
124,INTRODUCTION,"soit plaisant ou pathétique, jamais la note ne sonne faux, jamais"
125,INTRODUCTION,la bizarrerie ne dégénère en puérilité burlesque.
126,INTRODUCTION,
127,INTRODUCTION,"C'est là un tour de force comme il ne s'en fait pas souvent, et"
128,INTRODUCTION,c'est avec enthousiasme que je tends la main à M. Drummond pour
129,INTRODUCTION,le féliciter de l'avoir accompli.
130,INTRODUCTION,
131,INTRODUCTION,Il a véritablement fait là oeuvre de poète et d'artiste.
132,INTRODUCTION,
133,INTRODUCTION,J'ajouterai qu'il a fait aussi oeuvre de bon citoyen. Car le
134,INTRODUCTION,jour sous lequel il présente mes compatriotes illettrés ne peut
135,INTRODUCTION,manquer de valoir à ceux-ci--et partant à tout le reste de la
136,INTRODUCTION,nationalité--un accroissement désirable dans l'estime de nos
137,INTRODUCTION,"compatriotes de langue anglaise, qui n'ont pas été à même de"
138,INTRODUCTION,les étudier d'aussi près que M. Drummond.
139,INTRODUCTION,
140,INTRODUCTION,La peinture qu'en fait le poète est on ne peut plus sympathique et
141,INTRODUCTION,juste; et de semblables procédés ne peuvent que cimenter l'union
142,INTRODUCTION,de coeur et d'esprit qui doit exister entre toutes les fractions
143,INTRODUCTION,qui composent la grande famille canadienne appelée à vivre et à
144,INTRODUCTION,prospérer sous la même loi et le même drapeau.
145,INTRODUCTION,
146,INTRODUCTION,"En lisant les vers de M. Drummond, le Canadien-français sent que"
147,INTRODUCTION,"c'est là l'expression d'une âme amie; et, à ce compte, je dois"
148,INTRODUCTION,"à l'auteur plus que mes bravos, je lui dois en même temps un"
149,INTRODUCTION,chaleureux merci.
