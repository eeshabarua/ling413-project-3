73,CHAPTER I.,
74,CHAPTER I.,
75,CHAPTER I.,There is a vast deal talked in the present day about Freewill. We
76,CHAPTER I.,like to feel that we are independent agents and are ready to overlook
77,CHAPTER I.,the fact that our surroundings and circumstances and the hundred and
78,CHAPTER I.,one subtle and mysterious workings of the fate we can none of us
79,CHAPTER I.,"escape, control our actions and are responsible for our movements,"
80,CHAPTER I.,and make us to a great extent what we are.
81,CHAPTER I.,
82,CHAPTER I.,A man is not even a free agent when he takes the most important step
83,CHAPTER I.,"of his whole life, and marries a wife. He is impelled to it by"
84,CHAPTER I.,considerations outside of himself; it affects not only his own
85,CHAPTER I.,"present and future, but that of others, very often, and he must be"
86,CHAPTER I.,guided accordingly.
87,CHAPTER I.,
88,CHAPTER I.,"Emerson says; ""The soul has inalienable rights, and the first of"
89,CHAPTER I.,"these is love,"" but he does not say marriage. Love is the business of"
90,CHAPTER I.,"the idle and the idleness of the busy, but marriage is quite another"
91,CHAPTER I.,"affair--a grave matter, and not to be undertaken lightly, since it is"
92,CHAPTER I.,"the one step that can never be retraced, save through the unsavoury"
93,CHAPTER I.,"channels of shame and notoriety, or death itself."
94,CHAPTER I.,
95,CHAPTER I.,But perhaps Jack Chetwynd was hampered with fewer restraining
96,CHAPTER I.,"influences than most men, for he was alone in the world, without kith"
97,CHAPTER I.,"or kin, and might be fairly allowed to please himself, and pleasing"
98,CHAPTER I.,"himself in this case meant leading to the altar, or rather to the"
99,CHAPTER I.,"Registry Office, Miss Bella Blackall, music-hall singer and step"
100,CHAPTER I.,dancer.
101,CHAPTER I.,
102,CHAPTER I.,It was unquestionably a case of love at first sight. The girl was
103,CHAPTER I.,"barely seventeen, and her girlishness attracted him quite as much as"
104,CHAPTER I.,"her beauty, which was exceptional. There was nothing meretricious"
105,CHAPTER I.,"about it, for as yet she owed nothing to art--brown hair, warm lips,"
106,CHAPTER I.,"soft blue eyes, and a complexion like the leaf of a white rose--a"
107,CHAPTER I.,"woman blossom. Then, too, she was a happy creature, full of life and"
108,CHAPTER I.,happiness and bubbling over with childish merriment--no one could
109,CHAPTER I.,"help liking her, he told himself, but it was something warmer than"
110,CHAPTER I.,that. What makes the difference between liking and love? It is so
111,CHAPTER I.,"little and yet so much. There was an air of refinement about her,"
112,CHAPTER I.,"too, which to his fancy seemed to protest against the vulgarities of"
113,CHAPTER I.,her surroundings. He thought he could discern the stuff that meant an
114,CHAPTER I.,"actress in her, and prophesied that she would before long be playing"
115,CHAPTER I.,Juliet at the Haymarket. He was still at the age when the habit is to
116,CHAPTER I.,"discover geniuses in unlikely places, especially when the women are"
117,CHAPTER I.,pretty. He raved about her when he adjourned with his companions to
118,CHAPTER I.,"the bar, and they chaffed him a good deal to his face and sneered at"
119,CHAPTER I.,"him behind his back. He was there the next night, and the night,"
120,CHAPTER I.,after and by-and-by he managed to get introduced to her.
121,CHAPTER I.,
122,CHAPTER I.,"She was prettier off the stage than on, and her manner was charming,"
123,CHAPTER I.,and her voice delicious with its racy accent.
124,CHAPTER I.,
125,CHAPTER I.,"She was an American, and had been in London only a few months; and he"
126,CHAPTER I.,was duly taken to a second-rate lodging in a side street near the
127,CHAPTER I.,"Waterloo Road, and presented to ""Ma,""--a black satined and beaded"
128,CHAPTER I.,"type of the race. There was also a sister, whom, truth to tell, he"
129,CHAPTER I.,"objected to more than her maternal relative, for she was distinctly"
130,CHAPTER I.,"professional, not to say loud, and the little mannerisms which were"
131,CHAPTER I.,so taking in his inamorata were very much the reverse in Miss Saidie
132,CHAPTER I.,Blackall.
133,CHAPTER I.,
134,CHAPTER I.,"Still, he told himself, he was not going to marry the whole family;"
135,CHAPTER I.,which might be true in a sense and yet might not mean the entire
136,CHAPTER I.,"independence it implied. Bella's relations must, if he made her his"
137,CHAPTER I.,"wife, mean more or less to him."
138,CHAPTER I.,
139,CHAPTER I.,"However, youth is sanguine, and Jack Chetwynd did not look too"
140,CHAPTER I.,closely at the thorns which hedged his dainty rose-bud round. She at
141,CHAPTER I.,"least was all he could wish her to be--unsophisticated as a child,"
142,CHAPTER I.,and pure and good at heart.
143,CHAPTER I.,
144,CHAPTER I.,After a month's acquaintance it began to be understood that he was
145,CHAPTER I.,"engaged to her. ""Ma"" wept copious tears, and reckoned her Bella was a"
146,CHAPTER I.,"lucky girl to get such an ""elegant"" husband; and Saidie wished him"
147,CHAPTER I.,"happiness in a voice like a corn-crake, and declared that her sister"
148,CHAPTER I.,"was ""just the sweetest and best girl out of N'York,"" which she was;"
149,CHAPTER I.,"""and born to lead a private life,"" which she wasn't."
150,CHAPTER I.,
151,CHAPTER I.,Bella herself had very little to say. She blushed rosily when Jack
152,CHAPTER I.,made fervent love to her; acquiesced confusedly when he told her she
153,CHAPTER I.,"must give up the music-hall stage, and seemed to take happily to the"
154,CHAPTER I.,"idea of a quiet, uneventful life as Mrs. Jack Chetwynd."
155,CHAPTER I.,
156,CHAPTER I.,They took a small house in Camberwell New Road. Jack put up a brass
157,CHAPTER I.,"plate with his name on it, and M.D. in imposing letters, and invested"
158,CHAPTER I.,in a telephone for the accommodation of night callers; and Bella
159,CHAPTER I.,began to busy herself about the furnishing.
160,CHAPTER I.,
161,CHAPTER I.,That was a delightful time. The little bride elect was so excited and
162,CHAPTER I.,"eager, and showed herself wonderfully capable, and with quite a"
163,CHAPTER I.,pretty taste in draping and ornamenting; but there was a terrible
164,CHAPTER I.,hole in Jack's purse: chairs and tables seemed to cost a mint of
165,CHAPTER I.,money; and the young man sighed and hoped fervently that it would not
166,CHAPTER I.,"be long before patients appeared, or he would be obliged to say No to"
167,CHAPTER I.,his darling when she turned her appealing eyes upon him and begged
168,CHAPTER I.,"him to give her money for that ""duck of a screen,"" or something else"
169,CHAPTER I.,"that was from her point of view the most extraordinary bargain, but"
170,CHAPTER I.,"which, Jack reflected, privately, they could very well have done"
171,CHAPTER I.,without.
172,CHAPTER I.,
173,CHAPTER I.,"He was giving up a certainty in settling in Camberwell, for as House"
174,CHAPTER I.,Surgeon at St. Mark's his income was assured; but then as a married
175,CHAPTER I.,"man he could no longer have lived at the hospital, and ""one must risk"
176,CHAPTER I.,"something"" said Jack, hopefully."
177,CHAPTER I.,
178,CHAPTER I.,"They were married in May, just three months from that eventful night"
179,CHAPTER I.,"when our hero first saw pretty Bella Blackall, on the boards at the"
180,CHAPTER I.,"""Band Box,"" and Mrs. John Chetwynd was altogether so sweet and"
181,CHAPTER I.,"winsome in her simple white gown, that Saidie was right when she"
182,CHAPTER I.,hilariously remarked that Jack might well be forgiven for falling in
183,CHAPTER I.,"love with her ""all over again."""
184,CHAPTER I.,
185,CHAPTER I.,"The wedding was just as quiet as it could be, for Jack did not care"
186,CHAPTER I.,"to invite any of his friends. ""Ma"" and Saidie were altogether too"
187,CHAPTER I.,impossible; and unfortunately no one seemed to mind whether he did or
188,CHAPTER I.,not. There was one unpleasantness connected with the day which
189,CHAPTER I.,Chetwynd felt Bella might have had tact enough to avoid. Two or three
190,CHAPTER I.,"of Saidie's friends, in light and eminently professional attire, were"
191,CHAPTER I.,"of the party, the women a good deal worse than the men; and they all"
192,CHAPTER I.,"returned together to Holly Street, where a meal had been prepared in"
193,CHAPTER I.,"the front parlours, the landlady having generously placed them at the"
194,CHAPTER I.,disposal of her lodgers for the occasion. There was a good deal of
195,CHAPTER I.,banter and side jokes were bandied about from one to another; which
196,CHAPTER I.,"was galling to young Chetwynd, and made him devoutly thankful that"
197,CHAPTER I.,none of his own companions and friends were present. When at last
198,CHAPTER I.,Bella rose from the table to change her gown for the pale grey he
199,CHAPTER I.,"himself had chosen, with the big hat and nodding plumes in which she"
200,CHAPTER I.,"had looked such a dainty little mortal, he pushed his chair back with"
201,CHAPTER I.,a look of disgust on his face and left them to talk amongst
202,CHAPTER I.,themselves.
203,CHAPTER I.,
204,CHAPTER I.,"Saidie was distributing small pieces of wedding cake, laughing and"
205,CHAPTER I.,screaming at the top of her voice.
206,CHAPTER I.,
207,CHAPTER I.,"""Saikes, man! you are not to eat it. Put it under your pillow and as"
208,CHAPTER I.,"sure as I'm a Yank you'll see your intended,"" she cried. And then"
209,CHAPTER I.,followed an amount of vulgar chaff and coarse pleasantry which caused
210,CHAPTER I.,"the ""happy man"" to set his teeth hard and register a vow at the"
211,CHAPTER I.,bottom of his heart that this should be the last occasion on which
212,CHAPTER I.,his wife should associate with her sister's friends.
213,CHAPTER I.,
214,CHAPTER I.,"And then Bella came tripping down the narrow staircase, her cheeks"
215,CHAPTER I.,warm with a pale pink colour that made her inexpressibly lovely; and
216,CHAPTER I.,the carriage which Mrs. Blackall had insisted upon ordering to take
217,CHAPTER I.,"the young couple to the station was at the door, and in the bustle"
218,CHAPTER I.,that ensued Jack lost sight of all annoyances and remembered only
219,CHAPTER I.,that he had married the girl he loved and that he was the happiest
220,CHAPTER I.,fellow in the universe; and amid a shower of rice and a white satin
221,CHAPTER I.,"slipper (one of Saidie's), which fell right into Bella's lap; the"
222,CHAPTER I.,"last farewell was spoken, and they drove away."
223,CHAPTER I.,
224,CHAPTER I.,"""Only to Brighton!"" cried Nina Nankin, the celebrity famed for the"
225,CHAPTER I.,height to which she could raise one leg while standing upon the
226,CHAPTER I.,"other. ""What a mean chap! He might have forked out enough for a trip"
227,CHAPTER I.,"to Paris, I should have thought."""
228,CHAPTER I.,
229,CHAPTER I.,"""It wouldn't satisfy me,"" returned Saidie, turning up her nose"
230,CHAPTER I.,"disdainfully; ""but he isn't my style, anyway."""
231,CHAPTER I.,
232,CHAPTER I.,"""Bit of a prig, eh?"""
233,CHAPTER I.,
234,CHAPTER I.,Saidie nodded.
235,CHAPTER I.,
236,CHAPTER I.,"""I do detest a man who fancies himself a head and shoulders above the"
237,CHAPTER I.,"rest of his kind,"" said that young lady vehemently; ""you'll generally"
238,CHAPTER I.,find out he don't amount to a row of pins. My! ain't I glad I'm not
239,CHAPTER I.,going to live with him. I would as lief go to Bible-class every day
240,CHAPTER I.,of the week. I'll bet my bottom dollar Bella'll see the mistake she's
241,CHAPTER I.,made before she's many weeks older. There's a chip of the old block
242,CHAPTER I.,"about that young woman, for all her baby ways and her innocent"
243,CHAPTER I.,"know-nothing. He'll be a spry man, will Dr. Chetwynd, to come up to"
244,CHAPTER I.,"her. It'll take him all he knows to get ahead, you bet""."
245,CHAPTER I.,
246,CHAPTER I.,Saidie lay back in the chair and laughed till the tears ran down her
247,CHAPTER I.,cheeks.
248,CHAPTER I.,
249,CHAPTER I.,
250,CHAPTER I.,
251,CHAPTER I.,
252,CHAPTER II,CHAPTER II
253,CHAPTER II,
254,CHAPTER II,
255,CHAPTER II,It was not long before Dr. Chetwynd's eyes were fully open to the
256,CHAPTER II,mistake he had made and that he realised the fact that you cannot
257,CHAPTER II,"fashion a Dresden vase out of earthenware, and though pinchbeck may"
258,CHAPTER II,"pass muster for gold, it does not make it the real article."
259,CHAPTER II,
260,CHAPTER II,"At first Bella did try her ""level best"" as Saidie put it, to be all"
261,CHAPTER II,"that Jack required of her. She took his lecturings humbly, held her"
262,CHAPTER II,"peace when he scolded her (and I am afraid he constantly did), and"
263,CHAPTER II,acknowledged in the depths of her shallow little mind that she fell
264,CHAPTER II,far short of what his wife should be. But as time went on she grew
265,CHAPTER II,less solicitous about pleasing him. His standard was an almost
266,CHAPTER II,"impossible one to the very second-rate little American girl, to whom"
267,CHAPTER II,"the atmosphere of the ""Halls"" was far more congenial than the"
268,CHAPTER II,"humdrum, quiet life she led in the Camberwell New Road, and she"
269,CHAPTER II,slipped back little by little into the mire out of which he had
270,CHAPTER II,raised her.
271,CHAPTER II,
272,CHAPTER II,"""I can never learn to be what he wants me to,"" she said a little"
273,CHAPTER II,"pathetically to Saidie--""It is like standing on tiptoe all the time"
274,CHAPTER II,trying to reach up to his standard. I'm sick of it. If he loved me
275,CHAPTER II,"well enough to marry me, the same love ought to be strong enough to"
276,CHAPTER II,"make him contented with me. After all, I'm the same Bella now that I"
277,CHAPTER II,"was then."""
278,CHAPTER II,
279,CHAPTER II,A word of advice at this juncture might have quieted the poor little
280,CHAPTER II,"wife, and brought her back into safe paths, for she really loved Jack"
281,CHAPTER II,in her heart; but Saidie was not the person to give it. Privately she
282,CHAPTER II,considered her sister a fool to have put up with this ridiculous
283,CHAPTER II,nonsense of her husband's as long as she had done; and the line of
284,CHAPTER II,argument she took was about the worst she could have adopted for the
285,CHAPTER II,happiness and peace of the Camberwell household.
286,CHAPTER II,
287,CHAPTER II,"She was a good deal older than Bella, and the girl had been wont to"
288,CHAPTER II,"rely upon her in a great measure, and to look up to her as a"
289,CHAPTER II,"practical, sensible person, which Bella was quite ready to admit she"
290,CHAPTER II,"herself was very far from being; so now, when Saidie spoke in a"
291,CHAPTER II,"resolute, determined way, she listened meekly, if she did not in so"
292,CHAPTER II,many words acquiesce in the wisdom and justice of what she said.
293,CHAPTER II,
294,CHAPTER II,"""As far as I can see, you don't get a bit of fun and happiness out of"
295,CHAPTER II,"your life,"" remarked Saidie, critically examining her features in the"
296,CHAPTER II,"glass. ""What did you marry him for, I should like to know? You might"
297,CHAPTER II,"as well be Bella Blackall, on the boards again, and free, as the wife"
298,CHAPTER II,"of a stingy fellow like that."""
299,CHAPTER II,
300,CHAPTER II,"""Oh! Saidie, he doesn't grudge me anything."" The young wife felt a"
301,CHAPTER II,little compunction in her heart.
302,CHAPTER II,
303,CHAPTER II,"""Yes he does."" Saidie turned round and faced her sister. ""He don't"
304,CHAPTER II,"like you to enjoy yourself, not a little bit. He would keep you"
305,CHAPTER II,"wrapped up in cotton wool if he could, and if you don't make a stand"
306,CHAPTER II,"now, once and for all, and let him see you have a mind of your own"
307,CHAPTER II,"and intend to do as you like, you'll regret it to the last day of"
308,CHAPTER II,"your life. Who is he, anyway? I guess our family's as good, if we"
309,CHAPTER II,"knew anything about them, which we don't, worse luck. Just you give"
310,CHAPTER II,"him back his own sauce, Bella, and next time he finds fault with you,"
311,CHAPTER II,laugh in his face and tell him he has got to put up with what he
312,CHAPTER II,"finds, for it ain't likely you can alter your nature to suit his high"
313,CHAPTER II,"mightiness. Pitch on a thing or two he does which you don't like, and"
314,CHAPTER II,give him a sermon as long as your arm. You see; he will come off his
315,CHAPTER II,pedestal. Sakes alive! he ought to have me to deal with; I bet I'd
316,CHAPTER II,"teach him a thing or two."""
317,CHAPTER II,
318,CHAPTER II,"And then Saidie whipped herself off to the ""Rivolette,"" where she"
319,CHAPTER II,sang a doubtful song and displayed her finely turned limbs in a style
320,CHAPTER II,"that would have disgusted her brother-in-law, if he had been there to"
321,CHAPTER II,see.
322,CHAPTER II,
323,CHAPTER II,But music halls were not to his liking under any circumstances. He
324,CHAPTER II,"had never really cared for them, even in his bachelor days, and now"
325,CHAPTER II,he would have cut his right hand off rather than be seen with his
326,CHAPTER II,"young wife beside him, at such resorts."
327,CHAPTER II,
328,CHAPTER II,"Then, too, Dr. Chetwynd felt that it behoved him to be circumspect in"
329,CHAPTER II,"all his actions, for his practice was steadily increasing and he was"
330,CHAPTER II,"becoming popular, and had serious thoughts of migrating westward. It"
331,CHAPTER II,was a constant source of vexation to him that Bella was not liked as
332,CHAPTER II,"much as her handsome, clever husband, and he began to be painfully"
333,CHAPTER II,alive to the fact that she could not have been received in certain
334,CHAPTER II,houses whose doors would have been gradually opened to him. In a
335,CHAPTER II,"social sense his wife was a failure, and with a sigh he realised that"
336,CHAPTER II,it was almost an impossibility to show her where the fault lay; he
337,CHAPTER II,could not always be at her elbow to guard against little solecisms of
338,CHAPTER II,manner and speech which he knew must jar and grate on others even
339,CHAPTER II,more than on himself.
340,CHAPTER II,
341,CHAPTER II,"It went terribly against the grain, for he loved her none the less"
342,CHAPTER II,that his eyes were not blinded to her shortcomings. She was still the
343,CHAPTER II,"same winsome girl he had made his own; large-hearted, gentle and"
344,CHAPTER II,"affectionate, but--and he sighed impatiently, for that something"
345,CHAPTER II,lacking was for ever pulling him back and standing in the way of his
346,CHAPTER II,own social advancement.
347,CHAPTER II,
348,CHAPTER II,"He became less demonstrative, less congenial, and his practice made"
349,CHAPTER II,"huge demands upon his time, and left but scant opportunity for"
350,CHAPTER II,pleasure-seeking. Lines traced themselves upon his brow and lurked at
351,CHAPTER II,"the corners of his mouth; he aged rapidly, and began to look like an"
352,CHAPTER II,elderly man while Bella was still little more than a girl.
353,CHAPTER II,
354,CHAPTER II,On the night of Mrs. Chetwynd's return from the maternal roof (for
355,CHAPTER II,"Mrs. Blackall still lived near the Waterloo Road, and her elder"
356,CHAPTER II,"daughter continued to make her home with her), she found her husband,"
357,CHAPTER II,"a good deal to her surprise, seated in the drawing-room, gay with"
358,CHAPTER II,flowers and crowded with knick-nacks of every description. He had in
359,CHAPTER II,his hand a book which he flung down with an annoyed gesture as his
360,CHAPTER II,wife opened the door.
361,CHAPTER II,
362,CHAPTER II,"It was perhaps no worse than others of its type, but it had not an"
363,CHAPTER II,"honest moral tone and was not therefore, John Chetwynd considered, a"
364,CHAPTER II,desirable work for his young wife's perusal.
365,CHAPTER II,
366,CHAPTER II,"""Have you read this?"" he asked."
367,CHAPTER II,
368,CHAPTER II,"""No; it is one of Saidie's. Is it interesting?"""
369,CHAPTER II,
370,CHAPTER II,John Chetwynd's answer was to hurl the volume under the grate with an
371,CHAPTER II,angry word.
372,CHAPTER II,
373,CHAPTER II,Bella flushed.
374,CHAPTER II,
375,CHAPTER II,"""Why did you do that? I want to read it."""
376,CHAPTER II,
377,CHAPTER II,"""I will not allow you to sully your mind with such filth. It only"
378,CHAPTER II,"goes to prove what I have so often told you, that your sister is not"
379,CHAPTER II,a proper associate for any young woman. A book of that
380,CHAPTER II,"description--faugh!"""
381,CHAPTER II,
382,CHAPTER II,Bella picked up the offending volume and looked ruefully at its
383,CHAPTER II,"battered condition. ""I should have supposed that as a married woman I"
384,CHAPTER II,"might read anything,"" she said with an assumption of dignity."
385,CHAPTER II,
386,CHAPTER II,"""Why should you be less pure because you have a husband, my child?"
387,CHAPTER II,"Don't run away with any such notion."""
388,CHAPTER II,
389,CHAPTER II,"""Well, I will read it and give you my opinion of it."""
390,CHAPTER II,
391,CHAPTER II,"""You will do no such thing. I forbid it, Bella."""
392,CHAPTER II,
393,CHAPTER II,"""In a matter like this I shall judge for myself."" Her cheeks were"
394,CHAPTER II,"scarlet, and she kept her eyes downbent."
395,CHAPTER II,
396,CHAPTER II,"""I will not--"""
397,CHAPTER II,
398,CHAPTER II,"""Bella!"""
399,CHAPTER II,
400,CHAPTER II,"It was the first time in their married life that she had defied him,"
401,CHAPTER II,and he looked at her in utter astonishment.
402,CHAPTER II,
403,CHAPTER II,"""Yes,"" she cried, turning on him like a small fury, with the book"
404,CHAPTER II,"tightly held in both hands; ""I'm not a child to be dictated to and"
405,CHAPTER II,ordered to do this and that. I'm perfectly well able to act for
406,CHAPTER II,myself and I intend to do so now and always. I'm sick of your eternal
407,CHAPTER II,"fault-finding, and the sooner you know it the better. If it's not one"
408,CHAPTER II,"thing it's another. Nothing I do is right and I'm about tired of it."""
409,CHAPTER II,
410,CHAPTER II,John Chetwynd sat perfectly silent under this tirade. He was a shrewd
411,CHAPTER II,"man, and he knew that Bella had been spending the evening with her"
412,CHAPTER II,"own people, and jumped at once to the conclusion that in defying him"
413,CHAPTER II,"she was acting by their advice, and his brow grew black and lowering."
414,CHAPTER II,
415,CHAPTER II,"Then he looked up at Bella, who, a little ashamed of her vehemence,"
416,CHAPTER II,"was slowly unbuttoning her gloves, having laid aside the unlucky"
417,CHAPTER II,cause of the battle royal.
418,CHAPTER II,
419,CHAPTER II,"""My wife,"" he said kindly, ""if you will not act on my advice, let me"
420,CHAPTER II,"beg of you to think twice before accepting that of others, since I at"
421,CHAPTER II,"least may be credited with having your real good at heart."""
422,CHAPTER II,
423,CHAPTER II,"""And you think that--you mean to imply that--"""
424,CHAPTER II,
425,CHAPTER II,"""That your sister has her own ends to serve? Undoubtedly I do."""
426,CHAPTER II,
427,CHAPTER II,"""You are all wrong--all wrong."" But the tell-tale blushes on Bella's"
428,CHAPTER II,face showed him plainly enough that he had been right in his
429,CHAPTER II,"conjecture, and had to thank his wife's relatives for her rebellion"
430,CHAPTER II,and newly developed obstinacy and resentment.
431,CHAPTER II,
432,CHAPTER II,"""Now, Bella, from to-night I cannot allow you to go to Holly Street:"
433,CHAPTER II,"stay,"" as Bella would have spoken, ""you may see your mother here when"
434,CHAPTER II,"you please, but you must let your sister fully understand that she"
435,CHAPTER II,"will not be welcome. Something surely is due to me as your husband,"
436,CHAPTER II,and that there is no great amount of sympathy between you and Saidie
437,CHAPTER II,you have said repeatedly; therefore I am asking no great sacrifice of
438,CHAPTER II,"you. Do you hear me, Bella?"""
439,CHAPTER II,
440,CHAPTER II,"""Yes, I hear."""
441,CHAPTER II,
442,CHAPTER II,"""And you will respect my wishes in the matter?"""
443,CHAPTER II,
444,CHAPTER II,"""I don't know,"" she spoke uncertainly."
445,CHAPTER II,
446,CHAPTER II,"She was not fond of her sister, as he had said; certainly not"
447,CHAPTER II,sufficiently fond of her to allow her to come between herself and
448,CHAPTER II,Jack; and yet she felt that it would be unwise and undignified if she
449,CHAPTER II,were to give in and refuse Saidie admission to their house. She had
450,CHAPTER II,"just declared that she would stand no coercion; and after all, what"
451,CHAPTER II,had poor Saidie done?
452,CHAPTER II,
453,CHAPTER II,"""I don't think you have any right to keep my people away,"" she said"
454,CHAPTER II,"at last, sullenly. ""This is my house as well as yours, remember."""
455,CHAPTER II,
456,CHAPTER II,"""I am not going to argue over it, my dear girl."" Dr. Chetwynd rose"
457,CHAPTER II,determinedly from his chair with an expression on his face which his
458,CHAPTER II,"wife had learned to know and dread. ""I forbid you to ask your sister"
459,CHAPTER II,here again. I am sorry to have to speak so decidedly; but your
460,CHAPTER II,"conduct leaves me no alternative."""
461,CHAPTER II,
462,CHAPTER II,And he walked quickly across the floor and the next moment the door
463,CHAPTER II,closed upon him.
464,CHAPTER II,
465,CHAPTER II,"""I don't care what he says. I won't be ordered about,"" flashed out"
466,CHAPTER II,"Bella, all that was worst in her nature roused by Jack's resolution."
467,CHAPTER II,"""Saidie is quite right; if I don't put my foot down I shall soon be"
468,CHAPTER II,"nothing better than a white slave."""
469,CHAPTER II,
470,CHAPTER II,"""Putting her foot down,"" certainly had one effect, namely, that of"
471,CHAPTER II,making life anything but a bed of roses for the unfortunate doctor.
472,CHAPTER II,
473,CHAPTER II,Never had Bella shown herself so unamiable and unloveable as during
474,CHAPTER II,the next two days. She hardly addressed her husband and she flounced
475,CHAPTER II,about the room and tossed her head and hummed music-hall ditties
476,CHAPTER II,"(which she had caught from Saidie) under her breath, and altogether"
477,CHAPTER II,comported herself in the most exasperating fashion.
478,CHAPTER II,
479,CHAPTER II,John Chetwynd hardly knew how to act towards her. If he pretended to
480,CHAPTER II,"be unconscious of anything unusual, it would probably provoke her to"
481,CHAPTER II,"stronger measures, and yet he was very loth to stir up strife between"
482,CHAPTER II,"them, and leant towards the hope that this spirit of fractiousness"
483,CHAPTER II,"would die out in time and that Bella would become her loving,"
484,CHAPTER II,tractable self again. But he reckoned without his host.
485,CHAPTER II,
486,CHAPTER II,"Saidie, who was duly apprised of the condition of things, urged upon"
487,CHAPTER II,"her sister to stick to her guns and on no account to yield an inch,"
488,CHAPTER II,"and although desperately miserable, Bella took her advice."
489,CHAPTER II,
490,CHAPTER II,"Returning from seeing a patient a day or two later, Dr. Chetwynd ran"
491,CHAPTER II,"into the arms of an old friend, a man he had not seen since his"
492,CHAPTER II,marriage.
493,CHAPTER II,
494,CHAPTER II,"""Why, Meynell, old chap, where have you dropped from?"" he exclaimed,"
495,CHAPTER II,grasping the outstretched hand.
496,CHAPTER II,

498,CHAPTER II,"ever sees you nowadays."""
499,CHAPTER II,
500,CHAPTER II,Dr. Chetwynd smiled.
501,CHAPTER II,
502,CHAPTER II,"""Perhaps you do not know I am a married man,"" he said. ""Which"
503,CHAPTER II,"accounts for a good deal of my time, and as a matter of fact I have"
504,CHAPTER II,"but little leisure, for my practice keeps me always at the"
505,CHAPTER II,"grindstone."""
506,CHAPTER II,
507,CHAPTER II,"""Doing pretty well?"""

509,CHAPTER II,"""Yes, I think I may say I am. Uphill work, of course, but still--"""
510,CHAPTER II,
511,CHAPTER II,"""And where are you living?"""
512,CHAPTER II,
513,CHAPTER II,Chetwynd hesitated.
514,CHAPTER II,
515,CHAPTER II,"""Close by here,"" he replied the next moment. ""Come home with me now,"
516,CHAPTER II,"if you have nothing better to do, and allow me to present my wife to"
517,CHAPTER II,"you."""
518,CHAPTER II,
519,CHAPTER II,And they walked on side by side.
520,CHAPTER II,
521,CHAPTER II,"""You have dined? I am afraid--"""
522,CHAPTER II,
523,CHAPTER II,"""My dear fellow, I have this moment left the club."""
524,CHAPTER II,
525,CHAPTER II,Dr. Chetwynd put his latch-key into the lock and ushered his friend
526,CHAPTER II,upstairs to his wife's pretty drawing-room.
527,CHAPTER II,
528,CHAPTER II,"But Bella was not there; and finding that she was not in her bedroom,"
529,CHAPTER II,"or in fact in the house at all, he rang the bell and questioned the"
530,CHAPTER II,maid as to when her mistress had gone out and if she knew when she
531,CHAPTER II,would be likely to return.
532,CHAPTER II,
533,CHAPTER II,"""No, sir, that I'm sure I don't. My mistress never said anything to"
534,CHAPTER II,"me."""
535,CHAPTER II,
536,CHAPTER II,"""Well, she is not likely to be away long,"" remarked the doctor"
537,CHAPTER II,"philosophically. ""Have a cigar, Meynell."""
538,CHAPTER II,
539,CHAPTER II,"""Thanks, no. Your wife spoils you, Jack, if she allows you to smoke"

542,CHAPTER II,"""Oh, she will not mind; but we will go down to my den shortly. You"
543,CHAPTER II,"see, Meynell, I'm a bit of a Bohemian, although I like to preserve"
544,CHAPTER II,"the customs of the civilised world all the same, to a certain extent."
545,CHAPTER II,But my little wife--well--she--she--I daresay you may have heard she
546,CHAPTER II,"was on the stage before I married her."""
547,CHAPTER II,
548,CHAPTER II,"""No, indeed I hadn't."" Gus Meynell looked a good deal surprised."
549,CHAPTER II,
550,CHAPTER II,"""Well, I mention it because perhaps she is not quite like the"
551,CHAPTER II,"ordinary run of women."""
552,CHAPTER II,
553,CHAPTER II,Meynell could no longer be blind to the want of ease in his host's
554,CHAPTER II,"manner, and in his turn became proportionately uncomfortable."
555,CHAPTER II,
556,CHAPTER II,"""Hang it all! A man marries to please himself,"" he said awkwardly."
557,CHAPTER II,
558,CHAPTER II,"""She is just the dearest girl in the world,"" continued Jack Chetwynd,"
559,CHAPTER II,"with warmth. ""I'm not only fond of her, but proud of her too, but you"
560,CHAPTER II,"know--"""
561,CHAPTER II,
562,CHAPTER II,"""I perfectly understand what you mean. To my idea unconventionality"

567,CHAPTER II,
568,CHAPTER II,"""What is that?"" Chetwynd broke in upon his friend's speech with a"
569,CHAPTER II,nervous start and exclamation. The hall door opened with a loud bang
570,CHAPTER II,and a woman's noisy laugh could be heard as a pelter of high-heeled
571,CHAPTER II,shoes came along the tesselated hall and then the vision of a pretty
572,CHAPTER II,"girl at the doorway, accompanied by a man and two women."
573,CHAPTER II,
574,CHAPTER II,"""Hallo, Jack! You are home before me, then."""

577,CHAPTER II,"Meynell, my wife."""
578,CHAPTER II,
579,CHAPTER II,Bella bowed a little coldly.

581,CHAPTER II,"""My sister, Mr. Meynell,"" she said, seeing that the doctor was"
582,CHAPTER II,"looking straight over Saidie's head. ""My sister, Miss Saidie"

584,CHAPTER II,"looking towards the open door, ""Come in, come in. Jack, I think you"

586,CHAPTER II,
587,CHAPTER II,Chetwynd looked terribly annoyed; but there was no choice left for
588,CHAPTER II,him but to extend his hand and mutter something to the effect that he
589,CHAPTER II,had not had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of his wife's
590,CHAPTER II,friends before.
591,CHAPTER II,
592,CHAPTER II,"""Glad to know you, sir--not one of us--not in the profession, I"

804,CHAPTER II,"""You mean that you did not abuse me when you had it entirely your own"
805,CHAPTER II,way! Wonderful! Perhaps you did not know that you bored me to death
806,CHAPTER II,the whole time. And now you have got it at last. I'm tired of your
807,CHAPTER II,cheap gentility and Brummagem pretensions; sick to death of hearing
808,CHAPTER II,"that nothing I have been used to is ""proper."" If my world is a second"
809,CHAPTER II,"rate one, show me a better. Why don't you introduce me to your own,"
810,CHAPTER II,if it is so vastly superior? Have you done it? Not you! You bury me
811,CHAPTER II,in this poky little hole and deliberately insult the only friends I
812,CHAPTER II,"have who take the trouble to come and look me up."""
813,CHAPTER II,
814,CHAPTER II,Chetwynd passed his hand over his brow dreamily. The whole thing was
815,CHAPTER II,"such a shock to him, he could hardly realise it."
816,CHAPTER II,
817,CHAPTER II,"""I hope you are saying much more than you mean,"" he said at last."
818,CHAPTER II,"""God knows if you have been dull I never suspected it."""
819,CHAPTER II,
820,CHAPTER II,"""Because I have not grumbled--because I smiled instead of yawning,"
821,CHAPTER II,"and laughed when I felt like crying, you never suspected it! Did you"
822,CHAPTER II,ever ask yourself what amusements you were providing for me while you
823,CHAPTER II,"were out all day? Not for a moment. Men like you never do, when they"
824,CHAPTER II,marry girls like us. You fancy you have been very noble and
825,CHAPTER II,chivalrous and plucky; but what you have really done is to get what
826,CHAPTER II,"you want and leave me to pay the cost. Once your wife, there was an"
827,CHAPTER II,"end of the matter so far as you were concerned, and to marry you was"
828,CHAPTER II,to complete my destiny! I was to sit all day long staring at the four
829,CHAPTER II,"walls, and if I happened to feel lonely, take a look at my marriage"
830,CHAPTER II,"certificate to cheer myself up! well--"" she drew a long breath and"
831,CHAPTER II,"suddenly left her seat and came quite close to him. ""Well,"" she said"
832,CHAPTER II,"again, ""I am not satisfied--do you hear? It may be the height of"
833,CHAPTER II,"ingratitude, but it is a fact all the same. I am not content and I"
834,CHAPTER II,have made up my mind (you may as well know it now as at any other
835,CHAPTER II,time) to go back to the stage. The life suits me and I am going to do
836,CHAPTER II,"it."" And then she paused."
837,CHAPTER II,
838,CHAPTER II,"If she expected her husband to storm and rave, insist and"
839,CHAPTER II,"expostulate, she was disappointed. He sat dumb and voiceless, his"
840,CHAPTER II,"face buried in his hands, and he did not even look up when, with the"
841,CHAPTER II,"air of a victor, Bella marched across the floor, beckoned to her"
842,CHAPTER II,"sister, and went up to her own room."
843,CHAPTER II,
844,CHAPTER II,"""I never gave you credit for such real grit,"" began Saidie,"
845,CHAPTER II,admiringly; but to her surprise Bella flung herself on the bed and
846,CHAPTER II,burst into uncontrollable sobs.
847,CHAPTER II,
848,CHAPTER II,"""I wish I was dead,"" she cried. ""I am a beast--an ungrateful beast;"
849,CHAPTER II,"and I have said what is not true. I have loved him always--always."""
850,CHAPTER II,
851,CHAPTER II,"""Well, you can't go back from your word now,"" said Saidie; ""You said"
852,CHAPTER II,"you would do it."""
853,CHAPTER II,
854,CHAPTER II,"""Yes, and I will."" Bella sat up and dried her eyes. ""I will go back"
855,CHAPTER II,"to the stage; but I did not say I would stop there, and I shan't if"
856,CHAPTER II,"I'm not happy, and if it makes a break between me and Jack."""
857,CHAPTER II,
858,CHAPTER II,"""Don't talk like that,"" cried Saidie disdainfully, ""You make me"
859,CHAPTER II,"tired!"""
860,CHAPTER II,
861,CHAPTER II,
862,CHAPTER II,
863,CHAPTER II,
864,CHAPTER III.,CHAPTER III.
865,CHAPTER III.,
866,CHAPTER III.,
867,CHAPTER III.,After this there was a lull; John Chetwynd observed that he had need
868,CHAPTER III.,"of more forbearance towards his wilful wife, and tried to exercise"
869,CHAPTER III.,it. He told himself that there was love enough and to spare; that
870,CHAPTER III.,with the deep affection he was convinced Bella bore him there was
871,CHAPTER III.,"nothing really to fear. She was young and ill-advised, and it behoved"
872,CHAPTER III.,"him to keep a careful watch over her, and above all things not to"
873,CHAPTER III.,draw too tight a rein. As for her threat of returning to her old life
874,CHAPTER III.,"and its meretricious attractions, after the first shock he dismissed"
875,CHAPTER III.,it from his mind. She had not really intended doing anything of the
876,CHAPTER III.,"sort; such a step was impossible. It was a wild idea, born of the"
877,CHAPTER III.,"excitement of the moment, and unworthy of a further thought, and so"
878,CHAPTER III.,he put it aside. Had not the question been argued and threshed out
879,CHAPTER III.,once and for all soon after marriage? He recalled with a curious lump
880,CHAPTER III.,"in his throat how she had put her hands into his and said; ""Your"
881,CHAPTER III.,"wishes are my wishes, now and always, Jack."" And there had been an"
882,CHAPTER III.,end of the matter.
883,CHAPTER III.,
884,CHAPTER III.,"""I will wait until the atmosphere has cleared a little,"" said John"
885,CHAPTER III.,"Chetwynd, reflectively, ""and then I'll tell her that at the end of"
886,CHAPTER III.,the year we will leave Camberwell and take a larger house in a better
887,CHAPTER III.,"neighbourhood."""
888,CHAPTER III.,
889,CHAPTER III.,"Thus, out of his love for his young wife, he made excuses for her and"
890,CHAPTER III.,took her back to his heart again.
891,CHAPTER III.,
892,CHAPTER III.,And Bella? Jack's conduct puzzled her. She had fully expected that he
893,CHAPTER III.,"would be exceedingly angry and displeased, and in her own mind had"
894,CHAPTER III.,prepared certain little set phrases which were to impress him with
895,CHAPTER III.,the fact that she intended to do as she pleased and would not allow
896,CHAPTER III.,herself to be dictated to or coerced. And thus it was that on the
897,CHAPTER III.,following morning she came down to breakfast with it must be
898,CHAPTER III.,confessed a forbidding look upon her pretty face and a defiant air
899,CHAPTER III.,about her bearing. But all her newly formed resolves were put to
900,CHAPTER III.,flight when Jack came towards her and deliberately kissed the lips
901,CHAPTER III.,which she vainly tried to withhold.
902,CHAPTER III.,
903,CHAPTER III.,"""Bella, you and I love each other too well to quarrel,"" he said"
904,CHAPTER III.,"kindly; ""let us forget all that happened last night."""
905,CHAPTER III.,
906,CHAPTER III.,What could she say? In spite of herself she felt that she was
907,CHAPTER III.,yielding; and though she did not meet him half way as he had fondly
908,CHAPTER III.,"anticipated she would do, still she allowed him to draw her into his"
909,CHAPTER III.,arms and did not repulse his caresses.
910,CHAPTER III.,
911,CHAPTER III.,"She might have shown a more generous spirit, it is true. Since he had"
912,CHAPTER III.,"tacitly acknowledged that they had been mutually to blame, she might"
913,CHAPTER III.,have offered something in the shape of an expression of regret; but
914,CHAPTER III.,peace in any shape and at any cost Chetwynd felt he must have.
915,CHAPTER III.,
916,CHAPTER III.,But Bella had by no means surrendered her determination of going on
917,CHAPTER III.,"the stage again, and was already with Saidie's assistance on the"
918,CHAPTER III.,look-out for an engagement. It would be difficult to define her
919,CHAPTER III.,feelings towards her husband at this juncture. That there was still a
920,CHAPTER III.,veiled hostility John Chetwynd could not fail to see; but in his
921,CHAPTER III.,"newly formed resolution to be patient and forbearing, he simply"
922,CHAPTER III.,"ignored it and diligently cultivated a kindly, gentle bearing,"
923,CHAPTER III.,interesting himself in her little domesticities and the general
924,CHAPTER III.,"routine of her everyday life. This amused Bella intensely, and"
925,CHAPTER III.,"although she would not have acknowledged it, perhaps touched her a"
926,CHAPTER III.,little.
927,CHAPTER III.,
928,CHAPTER III.,Why had he not done this before? And having been careless and
929,CHAPTER III.,"indifferent once, why was he not so still? For this is how it was"
930,CHAPTER III.,"with Bella; she was learning to compare her husband with her lover,"
931,CHAPTER III.,and be very sure the former suffered by comparison.
932,CHAPTER III.,
933,CHAPTER III.,"""Les absents ont toujours tort"" and Saidie found so much to say and"
934,CHAPTER III.,"said it in such a contemptuous, scornful way to Howard Astley, about"
935,CHAPTER III.,"her sister's husband, that perhaps there was some little excuse for"
936,CHAPTER III.,the young man's impression that Bella Chetwynd would be vastly better
937,CHAPTER III.,off under his protection than amid her present surroundings.
938,CHAPTER III.,
939,CHAPTER III.,"""The man was a brute,"" Miss Blackall declared."
940,CHAPTER III.,
941,CHAPTER III.,"Poor John Chetwynd! Not only was he far removed from being a brute,"
942,CHAPTER III.,"but he was also miles above the man whom Saidie delighted to honour,"
943,CHAPTER III.,and whose addresses and attentions she thrust upon Bella at every
944,CHAPTER III.,turn.
945,CHAPTER III.,
946,CHAPTER III.,"At first, to do her justice, the young wife shrank back dismayed."
947,CHAPTER III.,"Beyond his handsome face, Howard Astley had but little to recommend"
948,CHAPTER III.,"him, and after listening to his commonplaces and enduring the fulsome"
949,CHAPTER III.,"compliments it pleased him to pay, she would hurry home with tingling"
950,CHAPTER III.,"pulses and a shamed heart to Jack--Jack, who had once been all the"
951,CHAPTER III.,world to her.
952,CHAPTER III.,
953,CHAPTER III.,"Once! Oh, and such a little time ago! After all, how little she had"
954,CHAPTER III.,to complain of in the man who had made her his wife!
955,CHAPTER III.,
956,CHAPTER III.,"He was ""uninteresting,"" wrapped up in his profession, ""dull."" That"
957,CHAPTER III.,"was all, but it meant a very great deal to Bella. It meant"
958,CHAPTER III.,everything; and the sluggish conscience which just at first had a
959,CHAPTER III.,"word or two to say in his defence, gradually went to sleep again and"
960,CHAPTER III.,troubled its owner no longer.
961,CHAPTER III.,
962,CHAPTER III.,Why should she not enjoy herself as other women of her age did?
963,CHAPTER III.,
964,CHAPTER III.,"Why, indeed? She did not intend to do anything that was really wrong,"
965,CHAPTER III.,or even unbecoming in her position as Jack's wife; but still she was
966,CHAPTER III.,resolved on extracting the utmost amount of amusement possible out of
967,CHAPTER III.,"life, and thus with slow, subtle drifting and unconscious eyes--eyes"
968,CHAPTER III.,that would not see their peril--she reached the point where
969,CHAPTER III.,temptation steps in.
970,CHAPTER III.,
971,CHAPTER III.,It was his wealth that dazzled her.
972,CHAPTER III.,
973,CHAPTER III.,"She did so long to be rich. John was apt to be mean about trifles,"
974,CHAPTER III.,but this man--the man she allowed to make love to her--was a very
975,CHAPTER III.,prodigal in his liberality. He spent money like water. He rarely came
976,CHAPTER III.,empty-handed. Probably he knew the manner of woman he had to deal
977,CHAPTER III.,"with, and Bella hid the trinkets away with a guilty blush; they were"
978,CHAPTER III.,"not much good to her after all, for she did not dare to wear them,"
979,CHAPTER III.,lest Jack should ask awkward questions concerning the source from
980,CHAPTER III.,whence they came.
981,CHAPTER III.,
982,CHAPTER III.,"""I never can do anything I like,"" said Bella with a pout."
983,CHAPTER III.,
984,CHAPTER III.,And then there came a night when John Chetwynd found the pretty
985,CHAPTER III.,drawing-room deserted and his wife flown.
986,CHAPTER III.,
987,CHAPTER III.,The hours went by and as she did not return he grew seriously uneasy.
988,CHAPTER III.,
989,CHAPTER III.,"Where could she be? When eleven o'clock struck he put on his hat and,"
990,CHAPTER III.,"terribly though it went against the grain, started for Holly"
991,CHAPTER III.,Street--she might be at her mother's.
992,CHAPTER III.,
993,CHAPTER III.,"No, Mrs. Blackall had not seen her, she said; and she looked"
994,CHAPTER III.,"searchingly into her son-in-law's face as she spoke. ""Did Dr."
995,CHAPTER III.,"Chetwynd really not know where she was?"""
996,CHAPTER III.,
997,CHAPTER III.,"""No, madam, or assuredly I should not be here."""
998,CHAPTER III.,
999,CHAPTER III.,The doctor spoke with some heat; that there was something behind all
1000,CHAPTER III.,"this was very evident, and he naturally objected to being made a fool"
1001,CHAPTER III.,of.
1002,CHAPTER III.,
1003,CHAPTER III.,"""You don't know, then, that Bella is on at the Tivoli?"""
1004,CHAPTER III.,
1005,CHAPTER III.,John Chetwynd sat down suddenly. This news literally took his breath
1006,CHAPTER III.,away.
1007,CHAPTER III.,
1008,CHAPTER III.,It was not possible that Bella had taken such a step without his
1009,CHAPTER III.,knowledge or sanction. He looked up with such hopeless misery written
1010,CHAPTER III.,in his white face that Mrs. Blackall could not help a certain pity
1011,CHAPTER III.,"for her son-in-law, although in her opinion he had brought the thing"
1012,CHAPTER III.,"upon himself, and the very compassion she felt for his suffering had"
1013,CHAPTER III.,the effect of making her more harsh and unsympathetic.
1014,CHAPTER III.,
1015,CHAPTER III.,"""What did you expect?"" she asked. ""As a man of the world could you"
1016,CHAPTER III.,"really imagine that a young, high-spirited girl like my daughter"
1017,CHAPTER III.,would content herself with the life you tried to chain her down to?
1018,CHAPTER III.,She had had just taste enough of the admiration and applause of a
1019,CHAPTER III.,"public life to get a liking for it, and in an instant it is all taken"
1020,CHAPTER III.,"away and nothing given her in its place. It ain't commonsense, it--"""
1021,CHAPTER III.,
1022,CHAPTER III.,"""It may not be,"" said Chetwynd wearily; ""but there are women"
1023,CHAPTER III.,nevertheless to whom home and husband are all-sufficient and who ask
1024,CHAPTER III.,"for nothing beyond."""
1025,CHAPTER III.,
1026,CHAPTER III.,"""You made a great mistake, Mr. Chetwynd, when you--"""
1027,CHAPTER III.,
1028,CHAPTER III.,"""I did,"" he interrupted quickly; ""you are perfectly right; I did when"
1029,CHAPTER III.,"I believed my wife and your daughter to be one of these. Well,"" and"
1030,CHAPTER III.,"he rose wearily, ""she has put a barrier between us to-night that can"
1031,CHAPTER III.,"never be broken down."""
1032,CHAPTER III.,
1033,CHAPTER III.,"""Tut, tut, man; you have got your duty to do by her, and I'll take"
1034,CHAPTER III.,good care you do it. She is doing no wrong to join her profession
1035,CHAPTER III.,"again."""
1036,CHAPTER III.,
1037,CHAPTER III.,"""Our ideas as to right and wrong probably differ. I am certainly not"
1038,CHAPTER III.,"going to argue the point, nor do I wish to shirk what responsibility"
1039,CHAPTER III.,I took on my shoulders when I married. But if it is upon your advice
1040,CHAPTER III.,"she has acted in this matter, ask God to forgive you for the cruel"
1041,CHAPTER III.,"wrong you have done us both!"""
1042,CHAPTER III.,
1043,CHAPTER III.,Then he picked up his hat and went out of the house. It was long past
1044,CHAPTER III.,"midnight when Bella returned; but late though it was, she knew by the"
1045,CHAPTER III.,"lights in the drawing room that her husband was waiting up for her,"
1046,CHAPTER III.,"and with an impatient sigh, determined to get her lecture over, she"
1047,CHAPTER III.,ran lightly up-stairs.
1048,CHAPTER III.,
1049,CHAPTER III.,"He was there, sitting in her own cosy armchair, and he looked round"
1050,CHAPTER III.,expectantly as the door opened.
1051,CHAPTER III.,
1052,CHAPTER III.,"""Well,"" she said nervously, stripping off her gloves, and avoiding"
1053,CHAPTER III.,"meeting his stern, sad gaze. ""I daresay you wonder where I have been"
1054,CHAPTER III.,"and what has kept me so late; but, my dear old Jack, you will have to"
1055,CHAPTER III.,"give up the bad habit of sitting up to all hours for me, for I'm"
1056,CHAPTER III.,"likely to be late most nights now."""
1057,CHAPTER III.,
1058,CHAPTER III.,"She paused for a reply, but none came. Her easy assurance staggered"
1059,CHAPTER III.,"him; he could hardly believe that this self-composed, glib-spoken"
1060,CHAPTER III.,"young woman had been at one time his diffident, shy little love. The"
1061,CHAPTER III.,"unhappy man found it very hard to reconcile the two. ""Why don't you"
1062,CHAPTER III.,"speak?"" she asked impatiently, facing him in a defiant manner; and as"
1063,CHAPTER III.,he looked up at her he noticed for the first time that she had grown
1064,CHAPTER III.,"older and had lost all at once--at least, so it seemed to him--the"
1065,CHAPTER III.,"rounded, childish look from her sweet face and involuntarily a sigh"
1066,CHAPTER III.,broke from him.
1067,CHAPTER III.,
1068,CHAPTER III.,"""One would think I had committed a crime,"" cried she in disdain, and"
1069,CHAPTER III.,"then, catching her skirts up, she broke into a step dance, humming a"
1070,CHAPTER III.,popular music-hall air.
1071,CHAPTER III.,
1072,CHAPTER III.,"""Stop--do you hear me?--this instant stop!"" the devil in him burst"
1073,CHAPTER III.,out; he could restrain himself no longer.
1074,CHAPTER III.,
1075,CHAPTER III.,"""Woman! What are you made of?"" he cried in a voice of thunder, and"
1076,CHAPTER III.,"she, shrinking back a little, fell half frightened into a chair. He"
1077,CHAPTER III.,never could quite remember afterwards what he did say. He tried with
1078,CHAPTER III.,"rough eloquence, that might have moved a heart of stone, to show her"
1079,CHAPTER III.,"what it was she was doing, to appeal to her better, nobler self, to"
1080,CHAPTER III.,her love for him; he implored and entreated her to give up this new
1081,CHAPTER III.,life--for his sake.
1082,CHAPTER III.,
1083,CHAPTER III.,"He had nothing better to urge than that, poor fool! It weighed with"
1084,CHAPTER III.,her as just so much chaff. The time had gone by when his words would
1085,CHAPTER III.,have touched her; they glided lightly over what she called her
1086,CHAPTER III.,"""heart"" now and left no impression there."
1087,CHAPTER III.,
1088,CHAPTER III.,And then he went on his knees beside her and prayed her to grant him
1089,CHAPTER III.,"this one boon; he poured out a flood of feverish words, hardly"
1090,CHAPTER III.,pausing to think; he tried to paint an alluring picture of their life
1091,CHAPTER III.,"in the future: they would leave Camberwell, he said; she should go"
1092,CHAPTER III.,where she liked if she would but listen to reason; it would ruin him
1093,CHAPTER III.,"in his profession, he pleaded, if she persisted in returning to the"
1094,CHAPTER III.,stage. As he talked the pretty face grew harder and older. Bella had
1095,CHAPTER III.,"made up her mind, and the man beside her had not the faintest power"
1096,CHAPTER III.,to sway her by his reproaches or entreaties.
1097,CHAPTER III.,
1098,CHAPTER III.,And then he stumbled to his feet and stood waiting for his answer.
1099,CHAPTER III.,
1100,CHAPTER III.,"It came at last, clear and cold, falling like pellets of ice upon his"
1101,CHAPTER III.,impatient fervour.
1102,CHAPTER III.,
1103,CHAPTER III.,"""The thing is done now, and all the talking in the world will not"
1104,CHAPTER III.,"alter it."""
1105,CHAPTER III.,
1106,CHAPTER III.,"""And that is your last word to me--your husband?"""
1107,CHAPTER III.,
1108,CHAPTER III.,"Finding she did not speak, he walked across the floor, turning at the"
1109,CHAPTER III.,"door, hoping against hope, but she lay back as still as if she were"
1110,CHAPTER III.,dead.
1111,CHAPTER III.,
1112,CHAPTER III.,"When he had gone, Bella opened her eyes and held up her hand"
1113,CHAPTER III.,curiously. It was wet with--what?--tears.
1114,CHAPTER III.,
1115,CHAPTER III.,Her eyes were bright and dry.
1116,CHAPTER III.,
1117,CHAPTER III.,For a moment something of the old feeling swept over her.
1118,CHAPTER III.,
1119,CHAPTER III.,"Poor Jack! She half rose, then sank back again."
1120,CHAPTER III.,
1121,CHAPTER III.,"It was too late, she was thinking; as if it were ever too late to"
1122,CHAPTER III.,"make amends, to atone, while we have still breath and life!"
1123,CHAPTER III.,
1124,CHAPTER III.,"""It is all for the best, anyhow,"" she murmured after awhile, and when"
1125,CHAPTER III.,"philosophy is well to the fore, love hides its diminished head."
1126,CHAPTER III.,
1127,CHAPTER III.,
1128,CHAPTER III.,
1129,CHAPTER III.,
1130,CHAPTER IV.,CHAPTER IV.
1131,CHAPTER IV.,
1132,CHAPTER IV.,
1133,CHAPTER IV.,Six months wore themselves away; six months in every day of which
1134,CHAPTER IV.,"John Chetwynd lived a year, measured by the anxiety and misery it"
1135,CHAPTER IV.,held for him. He could no longer delude himself into the belief that
1136,CHAPTER IV.,"Bella loved him, for all her actions went to prove the contrary. But"
1137,CHAPTER IV.,"her end just once gained, there were no more bickerings and"
1138,CHAPTER IV.,"disputes--she even condescended to consider her husband's wishes,"
1139,CHAPTER IV.,when they did not clash or interfere with her own. But night after
1140,CHAPTER IV.,night he sat alone with the hateful consciousness that the woman who
1141,CHAPTER IV.,"bore his name was parading her charms to Dick, Tom and Harry; in"
1142,CHAPTER IV.,"fact, to anybody who chose to pay his shilling for the privilege of"
1143,CHAPTER IV.,contemplating them. It was in moments such as these that the iron
1144,CHAPTER IV.,entered his soul and there was no escape from it; he must bear his
1145,CHAPTER IV.,burden as many a better man had borne it before him. And thus it was
1146,CHAPTER IV.,"he buried himself in his profession, working with a will and vigour"
1147,CHAPTER IV.,that astonished no one so much as himself. He was rapidly becoming a
1148,CHAPTER IV.,popular man. Through sheer good luck (as he really believed it to be)
1149,CHAPTER IV.,he had diagnosed one or two cases with an ease and accuracy which not
1150,CHAPTER IV.,"only filled his purse beyond his utmost expectations, but helped him"
1151,CHAPTER IV.,up the ladder of fame at an amazing rate. But when emboldened by
1152,CHAPTER IV.,"success, and always remembering the fact that however wilful and"
1153,CHAPTER IV.,"oblivious she might be, she was still to all intents and purposes the"
1154,CHAPTER IV.,wife of his bosom and equally interested with himself in all his
1155,CHAPTER IV.,"undertakings, he recounted his triumphs and declared his intention of"
1156,CHAPTER IV.,"leaving Camberwell forthwith and settling in Camelot Square, Bella"
1157,CHAPTER IV.,"smiled, yet proved in no way elated at the intelligence."
1158,CHAPTER IV.,
1159,CHAPTER IV.,"""So, my dear, you can go as soon as you like and fix upon a house,"""
1160,CHAPTER IV.,he said.
1161,CHAPTER IV.,
1162,CHAPTER IV.,Bella yawned and stretched her arms above her head.
1163,CHAPTER IV.,
1164,CHAPTER IV.,"""Oh, you will know much better than I what is required,"" she replied."
1165,CHAPTER IV.,
1166,CHAPTER IV.,"""Have you, then, no interest in our new home?"" he asked, more hurt"
1167,CHAPTER IV.,than he could well have expressed.
1168,CHAPTER IV.,
1169,CHAPTER IV.,"""Do you ever show the slightest interest in what concerns me?"" she"
1170,CHAPTER IV.,retorted.
1171,CHAPTER IV.,
1172,CHAPTER IV.,"He winced. ""This is a mutual interest, surely, since we must occupy"
1173,CHAPTER IV.,"it together."""
1174,CHAPTER IV.,
1175,CHAPTER IV.,"""Must?"" she echoed dreamily."
1176,CHAPTER IV.,
1177,CHAPTER IV.,"""What do you mean?"" he asked sharply."
1178,CHAPTER IV.,
1179,CHAPTER IV.,"""Nothing, except that 'must' is the word I have banished from my"
1180,CHAPTER IV.,"vocabulary,"" and she smiled at him--actually smiled, though she must"
1181,CHAPTER IV.,have known she was stabbing him to the very heart.
1182,CHAPTER IV.,
1183,CHAPTER IV.,"He said no more; and indeed, words seemed to be useless."
1184,CHAPTER IV.,
1185,CHAPTER IV.,"So he chose the house himself,--one that could not fail to please"
1186,CHAPTER IV.,"Bella, he felt exultantly. She would be less than woman if she were"
1187,CHAPTER IV.,not glad to exchange the second-rate little dwelling in the
1188,CHAPTER IV.,"Camberwell New Road for the substantial residence, with its modern"
1189,CHAPTER IV.,improvements and embellishments in such a neighbourhood as Camelot
1190,CHAPTER IV.,Square.
1191,CHAPTER IV.,
1192,CHAPTER IV.,"It was not perhaps a palace, but it was a very great deal more"
1193,CHAPTER IV.,imposing than anything they had dreamt of in the early days of their
1194,CHAPTER IV.,"married life, and yet John Chetwynd told himself with a sigh that he"
1195,CHAPTER IV.,would gladly give up fame and prosperity to win back the old
1196,CHAPTER IV.,love-light in his wife's eyes.
1197,CHAPTER IV.,
1198,CHAPTER IV.,"And there are some among us who cannot love for so little--""Of man's"
1199,CHAPTER IV.,"love a thing apart."" Perhaps John Chetwynd would have been a happier"
1200,CHAPTER IV.,man had he been one of these.
1201,CHAPTER IV.,
1202,CHAPTER IV.,Even the task of furnishing fell to the doctor's lot. Bella did not
1203,CHAPTER IV.,"refuse, nor did she object to accompany him on what he might have"
1204,CHAPTER IV.,"naturally supposed would be a congenial task for her, but she showed"
1205,CHAPTER IV.,"herself so indifferent throughout that, after an effort or two to"
1206,CHAPTER IV.,"make her contented, he gave it up, and it ended in his carrying the"
1207,CHAPTER IV.,whole thing through himself.
1208,CHAPTER IV.,
1209,CHAPTER IV.,And he was not sorry when at length it was completed. On the morrow
1210,CHAPTER IV.,he would bring Bella to her new home.
1211,CHAPTER IV.,
1212,CHAPTER IV.,He stood under the bright lighted chandelier and looked round him.
1213,CHAPTER IV.,The carpet was thick and soft. Bella liked carpets her feet could
1214,CHAPTER IV.,"sink into, she had once said. There by the fireplace was the most"
1215,CHAPTER IV.,"luxurious easy chair he could purchase, upholstered in her favourite"
1216,CHAPTER IV.,"colour, pale blue. He pictured the dainty figure nestling in it, and"
1217,CHAPTER IV.,"a little glow stirred at his heart. After all, she was his wife, his"
1218,CHAPTER IV.,"fondly loved wife, and who could tell? Perhaps with the old life, old"
1219,CHAPTER IV.,"feuds would die out and with the new, joy and happiness dawn for them"
1220,CHAPTER IV.,both once more.
1221,CHAPTER IV.,
1222,CHAPTER IV.,John Chetwynd was not a religious man; he rarely went to church and
1223,CHAPTER IV.,"he never prayed; but now he covered his face with his hands, and his"
1224,CHAPTER IV.,lips moved inaudibly.
1225,CHAPTER IV.,
1226,CHAPTER IV.,"He was asking for a blessing on the new life, and there was something"
1227,CHAPTER IV.,like a tear in his eye and a suspicious huskiness in his voice as he
1228,CHAPTER IV.,"called out ""Come in"" in answer to a hurried knock at the door and"
1229,CHAPTER IV.,flung open the lid of a grand piano which was littered with music and
1230,CHAPTER IV.,"songs, running his hands over the keys and smiling a little."
1231,CHAPTER IV.,
1232,CHAPTER IV.,The piano was to be a surprise: Bella knew nothing about it.
1233,CHAPTER IV.,
1234,CHAPTER IV.,"Perhaps it would keep her more at home, for she was very fond of"
1235,CHAPTER IV.,music.
1236,CHAPTER IV.,
1237,CHAPTER IV.,"It had cost more than he ought to have paid, but still it was for"
1238,CHAPTER IV.,her.
1239,CHAPTER IV.,
1240,CHAPTER IV.,"""Come in, Mrs. Brewer--what is it? I'm just off. You will have us"
1241,CHAPTER IV.,"both here to-morrow at this time for good and all, I hope."""
1242,CHAPTER IV.,
1243,CHAPTER IV.,"""Indeed, sir, and I'm glad to hear it. Things do look most beautiful,"
1244,CHAPTER IV.,"and no mistake."""
1245,CHAPTER IV.,
1246,CHAPTER IV.,The good soul shambled across the floor and held out a letter wrapped
1247,CHAPTER IV.,in the corner of her apron.
1248,CHAPTER IV.,
1249,CHAPTER IV.,"""A boy brought it, sir, half an hour ago, but I clean forgot it, and"
1250,CHAPTER IV.,"that's a fact."""
1251,CHAPTER IV.,
1252,CHAPTER IV.,"""Never mind. It is probably of no importance."""
1253,CHAPTER IV.,
1254,CHAPTER IV.,But it was. By-and-by his eyes fell on it as it lay where Mrs.
1255,CHAPTER IV.,"Brewer's hard-working fingers had placed it, on the edge of a little"
1256,CHAPTER IV.,gaily-lined work table destined to hold Bella Chetwynd's cotton and
1257,CHAPTER IV.,"needles, and to his astonishment he observed it was in his wife's"
1258,CHAPTER IV.,handwriting.
1259,CHAPTER IV.,
1260,CHAPTER IV.,Ah! written just before she started for the----.He caught it up and
1261,CHAPTER IV.,tore it open. The next instant it fluttered from his hold.
1262,CHAPTER IV.,
1263,CHAPTER IV.,"For fully ten seconds John Chetwynd sat spell-bound, and then he"
1264,CHAPTER IV.,"broke into a laugh--mirthless, hollow."
1265,CHAPTER IV.,
1266,CHAPTER IV.,"""And I prayed to my God to send his blessing on--our--future,"" he"
1267,CHAPTER IV.,"said in a dull, mechanical manner. ""Well, the last act is played out"
1268,CHAPTER IV.,and they may ring the curtain down. From to-night I believe neither
1269,CHAPTER IV.,"in woman, Heaven, nor hell, save that which each man makes for"
1270,CHAPTER IV.,"himself."""
1271,CHAPTER IV.,
1272,CHAPTER IV.,Bella had turned her shapely back on the apotheosis of respectability
1273,CHAPTER IV.,for a life of excitement and the protection of another man. Nobody
1274,CHAPTER IV.,was surprised but John himself.
1275,CHAPTER IV.,
1276,CHAPTER IV.,Everybody had predicted it months ago. The only astonishing feature
1277,CHAPTER IV.,"of the scandal was, that it had not occurred before."
1278,CHAPTER IV.,
1279,CHAPTER IV.,The one other thing people found surprising was the callousness with
1280,CHAPTER IV.,which the injured husband took it.
1281,CHAPTER IV.,
1282,CHAPTER IV.,"It had always been believed that what love there was, was on his"
1283,CHAPTER IV.,"side, but now--"
1284,CHAPTER IV.,
1285,CHAPTER IV.,"Well, it is indeed an ill wind that blows us no good. If notoriety"
1286,CHAPTER IV.,"was what John Chetwynd desired, he got it in full measure, well"
1287,CHAPTER IV.,"pressed down and brimming over; his waiting room was besieged, for"
1288,CHAPTER IV.,"many patients flocked there, wide eyed in scrutiny, martyrs to"
1289,CHAPTER IV.,symptoms discovered or invented for the occasion.
1290,CHAPTER IV.,
1291,CHAPTER IV.,Of course he would divorce her. And he did.
1292,CHAPTER IV.,
1293,CHAPTER IV.,"In due course he obtained his decree _nisi_, which later on was made"
1294,CHAPTER IV.,absolute.
1295,CHAPTER IV.,
1296,CHAPTER IV.,"Bella's picture no longer stared him in the face from every hoarding,"
1297,CHAPTER IV.,and the newspaper advertisements knew her no more. She had gone back
1298,CHAPTER IV.,"to the States, and by-and-by was forgotten on this side the Atlantic."
1299,CHAPTER IV.,
1300,CHAPTER IV.,Now and then he was disagreeably reminded of her existence.
1301,CHAPTER IV.,
1302,CHAPTER IV.,Once in the Club a young fellow to whom Chetwynd was personally
1303,CHAPTER IV.,"unknown stretched himself behind a newspaper and muttered, ""Bella"
1304,CHAPTER IV.,Blackall Wasn't that the name of Dr. Somebody's wife who ran away
1305,CHAPTER IV.,"with another fellow?"""
1306,CHAPTER IV.,
1307,CHAPTER IV.,"""Yes, Bella Blackall was my wife,"" John Chetwynd answered with"
1308,CHAPTER IV.,"unruffled equanimity, picking up the paper which the other had thrown"
1309,CHAPTER IV.,"down. ""She used to be rather a clever dancer, too."""
1310,CHAPTER IV.,
1311,CHAPTER IV.,And he calmly perused the line which included her name among some
1312,CHAPTER IV.,well known American stars touring in the provinces.
1313,CHAPTER IV.,
1314,CHAPTER IV.,"""And he never turned a grizzled hair! I give you my word I felt more"
1315,CHAPTER IV.,"over the thing than he did,"" remarked Captain Hetherington"
1316,CHAPTER IV.,"afterwards; ""without exception the most cold-blooded individual ever"
1317,CHAPTER IV.,"met."""
1318,CHAPTER IV.,
1319,CHAPTER IV.,But John Chetwynd was far from being this. He had felt his wife's
1320,CHAPTER IV.,"desertion far too deeply to show his scars, nor was he a man to wear"
1321,CHAPTER IV.,his heart upon his sleeve; but as time went by and the utter
1322,CHAPTER IV.,"callousness of Bella's conduct came home to him, he realised to the"
1323,CHAPTER IV.,"full that she was unworthy of a single pang, and he became reconciled"
1324,CHAPTER IV.,"to the inevitable. His profession claimed every spare moment, and for"
1325,CHAPTER IV.,a man ill at ease there is no specific like hard work. By-and-by as
1326,CHAPTER IV.,"the years rolled on, another distraction presented itself. He became"
1327,CHAPTER IV.,"interested in one of his patients, the only daughter of the Duke of"
1328,CHAPTER IV.,"Huddersfield, Lady Ethel Claremont, and this interest blossomed into"
1329,CHAPTER IV.,something stronger and warmer--something that at last he dignified by
1330,CHAPTER IV.,"the name of love, though he was by no means without misgivings as to"
1331,CHAPTER IV.,whether it could ever really lay claim to the title.
1332,CHAPTER IV.,
1333,CHAPTER IV.,Certain it was that there was no more of the old exultation about his
1334,CHAPTER IV.,heart that had formed so large a part of his former courtship; there
1335,CHAPTER IV.,"were no extravagances, no quickened pulses--rapture's warmth had"
1336,CHAPTER IV.,yielded to the mildest of after-glows; but there was no reason that
1337,CHAPTER IV.,it should not prove as satisfactory in the long run. It is an open
1338,CHAPTER IV.,"question whether the doctor, popular though he undoubtedly was, would"
1339,CHAPTER IV.,have been considered an eligible suitor from the maternal point of
1340,CHAPTER IV.,"view, had it not been that just about this time fortune elected to"
1341,CHAPTER IV.,"bestow another favour upon him; his career had reached its apex, and"
1342,CHAPTER IV.,"(again through sheer good luck, as John Chetwynd modestly declared)"
1343,CHAPTER IV.,he was offered a baronetcy.
1344,CHAPTER IV.,
1345,CHAPTER IV.,"Now, every man is flattered and gratified that his merits should be"
1346,CHAPTER IV.,"recognised, and Chetwynd was no exception to the general rule, but"
1347,CHAPTER IV.,"there were a good many bitters mingled with the sweets, and the"
1348,CHAPTER IV.,hidden thorn among the rose-leaves had a nasty trick of obtruding
1349,CHAPTER IV.,itself. This step in social advancement materially helped his cause
1350,CHAPTER IV.,"with Lady Ethel, and the Duchess of Huddersfield deigned to smile"
1351,CHAPTER IV.,graciously upon her future son-in-law.
1352,CHAPTER IV.,
1353,CHAPTER IV.,"Ethel Claremont was an excellent girl, precisely the type he ought to"
1354,CHAPTER IV.,"marry. Decorous, with an ease and repose about her manner that were"
1355,CHAPTER IV.,"eminently patrician, she would be even more admirable as a wife than"
1356,CHAPTER IV.,"as a _fiancée_, but he could have found it in him to wish that she"
1357,CHAPTER IV.,"were just a little less faultless, a little more ""human,"" he would"
1358,CHAPTER IV.,"have said, only that the word has not a pleasant ring; yet it was not"
1359,CHAPTER IV.,"easy to substitute another unless it were ""womanly."""
1360,CHAPTER IV.,
1361,CHAPTER IV.,"""Pshaw!"" he cried angrily, ""who am I that I should be exacting, with"
1362,CHAPTER IV.,"such a past, such a history? and yet I am ready to quarrel with"
1363,CHAPTER IV.,"perfection, I who can never be grateful enough! A little wealth and"
1364,CHAPTER IV.,the love of a charming woman--what more can I possibly desire? It is
1365,CHAPTER IV.,"strange how soon one becomes accustomed to changes in life, and how"
1366,CHAPTER IV.,quickly an emotion fades into a memory. If I could but feel as I felt
1367,CHAPTER IV.,when I was struggling along battling with the hundred and one
1368,CHAPTER IV.,"difficulties which beset the path of a poor man, instead of having to"
1369,CHAPTER IV.,"remind myself perpetually what my emotions were then, there would be"
1370,CHAPTER IV.,some excitement in the contrast. I--I wonder--what she is doing? Is
1371,CHAPTER IV.,she alive or is she dead? What does it matter? But at times the doubt
1372,CHAPTER IV.,"will come whether--no, no; it is wicked--I was always good to her. I"
1373,CHAPTER IV.,"loved her, and she dishonoured me. The book is closed for ever, and I"
1374,CHAPTER IV.,"am weak when I reopen it."""
1375,CHAPTER IV.,

1377,CHAPTER IV.,
1378,CHAPTER IV.,
1379,CHAPTER V.,CHAPTER V.
1380,CHAPTER V.,
1381,CHAPTER V.,
1382,CHAPTER V.,"Since the thing was to be, there was nothing to be gained by"
1383,CHAPTER V.,"postponement. So decided the Duchess, and however fond of airing her"
1384,CHAPTER V.,"own sentiments and securing her own way Lady Ethel might be, on"
1385,CHAPTER V.,"ordinary occasions, for once she raised no objection. She was"
1386,CHAPTER V.,perfectly willing that her marriage with Sir John Chetwynd should
1387,CHAPTER V.,take place at once. Perhaps in her home Lady Ethel was not quite the
1388,CHAPTER V.,"plastic lay figure she was wont to appear in public, and the Duchess"
1389,CHAPTER V.,had spoken to her most intimate and confidential friends of the
1390,CHAPTER V.,"approaching nuptials with almost a sigh of relief, and a whispered"
1391,CHAPTER V.,word.
1392,CHAPTER V.,
1393,CHAPTER V.,"""She has indeed been very difficult to manage, and really, though I"
1394,CHAPTER V.,"am speaking of my own daughter, I never can quite understand Ethel;"
1395,CHAPTER V.,she is not like other girls. It will be a huge responsibility shifted
1396,CHAPTER V.,"from my shoulders when she is married."""
1397,CHAPTER V.,
1398,CHAPTER V.,"And everybody had wondered what the girl had seen in Sir John, that"
1399,CHAPTER V.,he should have taken her fancy. To the outside world and to those who
1400,CHAPTER V.,"had not come within the immediate charm of his manner and bearing, it"
1401,CHAPTER V.,"did offer food for speculation, and since his engagement he had grown"
1402,CHAPTER V.,greyer and stiffer and more professionally precise than ever.
1403,CHAPTER V.,
1404,CHAPTER V.,"But he suited Lady Ethel, or she fancied he did; which answered the"
1405,CHAPTER V.,purpose quite as well. She had always detested very young men; she
1406,CHAPTER V.,"liked a man whom she could look up to and lean upon, and certainly"
1407,CHAPTER V.,this she could do with perfect faith as regarded her _fiancé_. Now
1408,CHAPTER V.,Duchesses are no more exempt from the weary ills which weak flesh is
1409,CHAPTER V.,"heir to than their less favoured brothers and sisters, and in the"
1410,CHAPTER V.,early summer the Duchess began to complain of certain aches and pains
1411,CHAPTER V.,and to bethink her that Sir John's advice might be worth following;
1412,CHAPTER V.,so she drove over to Camelot Square and was shown into the waiting
1413,CHAPTER V.,"room with the rest of his patients. She had some little time to wait,"
1414,CHAPTER V.,"and while the Duchess sat tapping her foot impatiently at the delay,"
1415,CHAPTER V.,Ethel looked round the spacious apartment and decided on certain
1416,CHAPTER V.,improvements she would effect when she should preside over John's
1417,CHAPTER V.,establishment.
1418,CHAPTER V.,
1419,CHAPTER V.,"And then the door was flung open, and Soames, the eminently correct"
1420,CHAPTER V.,"footman, ushered them into his master's presence."
1421,CHAPTER V.,
1422,CHAPTER V.,The Duchess advanced gushing a little.
1423,CHAPTER V.,
1424,CHAPTER V.,"""So good of you to see us so soon! I was positively timid at coming"
1425,CHAPTER V.,"without an appointment, even with Ethel."""
1426,CHAPTER V.,
1427,CHAPTER V.,"""It is you who are good, Duchess, to give me such an unexpected"
1428,CHAPTER V.,"pleasure."""
1429,CHAPTER V.,
1430,CHAPTER V.,Sir John touched Ethel's cheek lightly with his lips and motioned his
1431,CHAPTER V.,visitors to be seated.
1432,CHAPTER V.,
1433,CHAPTER V.,"""Now is not that a pretty speech from a professional man! Ah, you"
1434,CHAPTER V.,"lovers, you are all alike, and when you are married--Ah! then you are"
1435,CHAPTER V.,"all the same."""
1436,CHAPTER V.,
1437,CHAPTER V.,"""What an accusation! I hope Ethel does not credit it, or I shall"
1438,CHAPTER V.,"never be permitted an opportunity of refuting such a calumny."""
1439,CHAPTER V.,

1441,CHAPTER V.,prettily.
1442,CHAPTER V.,
1443,CHAPTER V.,"""Well, I admit it--I do admire you immensely--I admire your power,"
1444,CHAPTER V.,"your position, your ability to make an income--a large income,"

1446,CHAPTER V.,"in a doctor's profession--people are always ill."""
1447,CHAPTER V.,
1448,CHAPTER V.,"""Mamma is ill herself,"" broke in Lady Ethel, ""and that is why we have"

1471,CHAPTER V.,
1472,CHAPTER V.,"""I have not the slightest doubt you will be entirely recovered in a"
1473,CHAPTER V.,"few days at most,"" said Sir John reassuringly; ""you have caught a"

1481,CHAPTER V.,
1482,CHAPTER V.,"""Well, better than my future son-in-law. Now I beg you not to be"

1567,CHAPTER V.,was now bent on making friends with the Mammon of Unrighteousness in
1568,CHAPTER V.,the shape of the Duchess of Huddersfield and the bride elect.
1569,CHAPTER V.,
1570,CHAPTER V.,"Left alone, Sir John stood upright, his hand on the back of his chair"
1571,CHAPTER V.,and his brows tightly drawn together.
1572,CHAPTER V.,
1573,CHAPTER V.,"Well, why not? What possible excuse could he make to his own heart"
1574,CHAPTER V.,for the delay?
1575,CHAPTER V.,
1576,CHAPTER V.,"None, none. And yet he felt a good deal as if a thunderbolt had"
1577,CHAPTER V.,"fallen from the skies at his feet, and it was more or less of a shock"
1578,CHAPTER V.,to him.
1579,CHAPTER V.,
1580,CHAPTER V.,Presently he rang his bell.
1581,CHAPTER V.,
1582,CHAPTER V.,"""Who comes next, Soames?"""
1583,CHAPTER V.,
1584,CHAPTER V.,"""Lady Rutherven, Sir John, but--but a lady who has no appointment has"

1586,CHAPTER V.,"see her first. She seems very ill."""
1587,CHAPTER V.,
1588,CHAPTER V.,"""Show her in!"""
1589,CHAPTER V.,
1590,CHAPTER V.,A second later the door swung open again and Soames announced:
1591,CHAPTER V.,
1592,CHAPTER V.,"""Miss Blackall!"""
1593,CHAPTER V.,
1594,CHAPTER V.,"Sir John started, but recovered himself in the next instant."
1595,CHAPTER V.,
1596,CHAPTER V.,"""Take a seat, madam."""
1597,CHAPTER V.,
1598,CHAPTER V.,He waved her to a chair and for several minutes they looked at each
1599,CHAPTER V.,other without speaking. The woman was the first to break the silence.
1600,CHAPTER V.,
1601,CHAPTER V.,"""I have come back,"" she said with a nervous laugh. ""I am ill; I"
1602,CHAPTER V.,"thought you might try to cure me."""
1603,CHAPTER V.,
1604,CHAPTER V.,"She had seated herself, but he remained standing."
1605,CHAPTER V.,
1606,CHAPTER V.,"What a handsome woman she had become, he was thinking, and how"
1607,CHAPTER V.,expensively dressed! There was something strange in the very
1608,CHAPTER V.,familiarity of the countenance presented to him. It had altered much
1609,CHAPTER V.,"from what he remembered it, but curiously enough he remembered it the"
1610,CHAPTER V.,more vividly because of that very alteration.
1611,CHAPTER V.,
1612,CHAPTER V.,"""What is your trouble?"" he asked huskily--""Why have you"
1613,CHAPTER V.,"consulted--me?"""
1614,CHAPTER V.,
1615,CHAPTER V.,"""It is my lungs. I don't know--let us call it a whim. I thought you"

1617,CHAPTER V.,"be my husband once."""
1618,CHAPTER V.,
1619,CHAPTER V.,"""Once! Well, I am willing to be your doctor."""
1620,CHAPTER V.,
1621,CHAPTER V.,"""I suppose you would do your best for a dog if it were dying,"
1622,CHAPTER V.,"wouldn't you? though you might not care if it recovered."""
1623,CHAPTER V.,
1624,CHAPTER V.,"""I have a very faithful dog,"" he said significantly."
1625,CHAPTER V.,
1626,CHAPTER V.,Bella winced.
1627,CHAPTER V.,
1628,CHAPTER V.,"""Dogs ask so little for their love. Oh, I didn't come here without a"
1629,CHAPTER V.,struggle. And I knew you would speak like this. But I have been
1630,CHAPTER V.,"abroad so long, and on the voyage home I got worse, and women--women"
1631,CHAPTER V.,"of your sort who had taken no notice of me, suddenly grew kind. I"
1632,CHAPTER V.,"said to myself, 'Bella, it looks bad for you when ladies forget how"
1633,CHAPTER V.,"common you are,' and then the thought struck me, London meant you! As"
1634,CHAPTER V.,a patient I might come to your house and be let in. You are clever
1635,CHAPTER V.,and you are great; if I had any self-respect I could not ask you; but
1636,CHAPTER V.,"I have not, you know; I never had any and'--and--I am--frightened! It"
1637,CHAPTER V.,"keeps me awake at nights, the fear. I--I am not going to--die?"""
1638,CHAPTER V.,
1639,CHAPTER V.,"""I have said I will do what I can for you."""
1640,CHAPTER V.,
1641,CHAPTER V.,"""You will sound me?"""
1642,CHAPTER V.,
1643,CHAPTER V.,"""Loosen your dress."""

1645,CHAPTER V.,"As he bent over her she raised her hand as if to smoothe his hair,"
1646,CHAPTER V.,"and the colour came into her face, but she did not touch him."
1647,CHAPTER V.,
1648,CHAPTER V.,"Her fingers, from which she had drawn her gloves, were laden with"
1649,CHAPTER V.,rings--rings which he had not given her. His breath came a little
1650,CHAPTER V.,faster as he stooped over her neck.
1651,CHAPTER V.,
1652,CHAPTER V.,"""Don't be scared to tell me the truth,"" she said; ""I guess I'm pretty"
1653,CHAPTER V.,"bad. You need not take the trouble to lie about it."""

1662,CHAPTER V.,
1663,CHAPTER V.,"""I mean that you must exercise great care and avoid excitement. Don't"
1664,CHAPTER V.,"brood--don't worry yourself by misgivings, which will only do you"
1665,CHAPTER V.,harm. Go away from England when the summer is over; go where the sun
1666,CHAPTER V.,shines and the air is mild. Lead a life of ease and indolence. I can

1737,CHAPTER V.,"""No,"" she said, slowly; ""I didn't. We took two little rooms over a"

1739,CHAPTER V.,"used to go out in an evening and do the marketing with a hand basket,"
1740,CHAPTER V.,to get it cheap. When we wanted a change we would take a bus to the
1741,CHAPTER V.,Park and look at the swells across the railings; and sometimes Saidie
1742,CHAPTER V.,"gave us tickets for the theatres. Seems odd, don't it? but it's a"
1743,CHAPTER V.,fact. I was livelier then than ever I've been in my life. While he

1838,CHAPTER V.,
1839,CHAPTER V.,A sort of stung expression came into the face of the kneeling woman

1842,CHAPTER V.,"""You are going to take another wife! My God! I never thought--I never"

1861,CHAPTER V.,not be right of you. She is a young girl and she might find it hard

1887,CHAPTER VI.,It was two days later. Sir John Chetwynd sat in his big easy chair
1888,CHAPTER VI.,"with an open letter before him. ""We are surprised to have seen and"
1889,CHAPTER VI.,"heard nothing of you,"" wrote the Duchess; ""more especially as after"
1890,CHAPTER VI.,"the few words we had in private upon a certain important matter, I"
1891,CHAPTER VI.,fully anticipated an early visit from you. But such a busy man as
1892,CHAPTER VI.,"yourself and one so much in request, both socially and"
1893,CHAPTER VI.,"professionally, must not be judged by the rules which govern the"
1894,CHAPTER VI.,"common herd, I suppose; at the same time (although I assure you she"
1895,CHAPTER VI.,has not said a word upon the subject) I can say that dear Ethel feels
1896,CHAPTER VI.,herself a wee bit neglected. You must have been _professionally_
1897,CHAPTER VI.,"engaged last night, I presume, since we were obliged to dine without"
1898,CHAPTER VI.,"you and go to see Sarah Bernhardt alone."""
1899,CHAPTER VI.,
1900,CHAPTER VI.,"He had spent the whole evening in his consulting rooms, totally"
1901,CHAPTER VI.,forgetting his promise to escort his _fiancée_ and her mother to the
1902,CHAPTER VI.,theatre.
1903,CHAPTER VI.,
1904,CHAPTER VI.,"Well, he would see them both on the morrow and make his peace, and"
1905,CHAPTER VI.,then--he dropped his head on his hands and fairly groaned. It was
1906,CHAPTER VI.,"useless to argue with himself, to bring commonsense to bear upon the"
1907,CHAPTER VI.,"point, to count up the advantages to be derived from this union with"
1908,CHAPTER VI.,"Lady Ethel; look at it which way he would, the fact remained the"
1909,CHAPTER VI.,"same, that he had no longer the remotest desire to marry again."
1910,CHAPTER VI.,
1911,CHAPTER VI.,"The knowledge had certainly come tardily, but not the less surely."
1912,CHAPTER VI.,
1913,CHAPTER VI.,"He did not, he told himself, love Lady Ethel as a man should love the"
1914,CHAPTER VI.,"wife of his bosom. Middle-aged, worn, and unemotional though he might"
1915,CHAPTER VI.,"be, he knew that he was yet capable of a much deeper feeling than she"
1916,CHAPTER VI.,had evoked and he had wakened to a realisation of this since he had
1917,CHAPTER VI.,again seen Bella.
1918,CHAPTER VI.,
1919,CHAPTER VI.,"He was no fool; he was, on the contrary, a shrewd, clever,"
1920,CHAPTER VI.,quick-witted man of the world and it was impossible to shut his eyes
1921,CHAPTER VI.,to the trouble. He thought of Bella as she was when he had first
1922,CHAPTER VI.,"married her; he recalled their courtship, her pretty half shy, half"
1923,CHAPTER VI.,tender ways--the girlish prettiness which time had turned into shame.
1924,CHAPTER VI.,
1925,CHAPTER VI.,She had left a scrap of lace on his table for her throat or her
1926,CHAPTER VI.,veil--Heaven knew what--and his eyes grew blurred and dim as he gazed
1927,CHAPTER VI.,"at it. He repeated mentally phrases which had fallen from her,"
1928,CHAPTER VI.,piecing them together and trying to weave the pattern of her life out
1929,CHAPTER VI.,of the fragments.
1930,CHAPTER VI.,
1931,CHAPTER VI.,She had changed pathetically. She had acquired the manner that her
1932,CHAPTER VI.,"sister used to have, and which he had so strenuously objected to--the"
1933,CHAPTER VI.,"slangy, devil-may-care tone, the total absence of which in the old"
1934,CHAPTER VI.,days had made his little sweetheart so conspicuously different from
1935,CHAPTER VI.,"her environment. She wore now the impress of evil, from her Regent"
1936,CHAPTER VI.,Street hat to her Paris gown. Manifestly she had risen in her
1937,CHAPTER VI.,"vocation, but he knew that her salary alone had never supplied the"
1938,CHAPTER VI.,"costume or the rings, and his heart ached."
1939,CHAPTER VI.,
1940,CHAPTER VI.,That night he sat at the Duchess of Huddersfield's table facing his
1941,CHAPTER VI.,"_fiancée_, and for the first time he wondered if sang-froid or"
1942,CHAPTER VI.,perfect equanimity were all that a man such as himself might desire.
1943,CHAPTER VI.,"She was, as Bella had put it, ""One of his own class--a lady,"" which"
1944,CHAPTER VI.,"she had never been, poor Bella! but he did wonder just a little how"
1945,CHAPTER VI.,much of real heart beat under the dainty laces that shrouded Lady
1946,CHAPTER VI.,Ethel's bosom. He had reflected once and not so long ago that that
1947,CHAPTER VI.,"portion of a woman's anatomy was superfluous, but he wavered in his"
1948,CHAPTER VI.,"belief now. He could stake his professional honour, his hopes of"
1949,CHAPTER VI.,eternity--of--everything--on the absolute purity of this girl;
1950,CHAPTER VI.,nothing would ever tempt Lady Ethel to swerve ever so little from the
1951,CHAPTER VI.,"path of rectitude and decorum. The cold, proud patrician face spoke"
1952,CHAPTER VI.,"for itself, and yet--he was in a brown study when the voice of his"
1953,CHAPTER VI.,prospective mother-in-law brought him out of the clouds.
1954,CHAPTER VI.,
1955,CHAPTER VI.,"""And now,"" she said in a significant tone and with a glance full of"
1956,CHAPTER VI.,"meaning, ""now I suppose you young people have lots to talk about, and"

1958,CHAPTER VI.,
1959,CHAPTER VI.,And the silken draperies swept themselves across the floor and the

1961,CHAPTER VI.,
1962,CHAPTER VI.,"Ethel lay back in a low, lounging chair with a big ostrich feather"

1964,CHAPTER VI.,"There was nothing else for it, and he took the plunge valiantly--and"
1965,CHAPTER VI.,"with precisely the correct amount of maidenly hesitancy, Lady Ethel"
1966,CHAPTER VI.,named a day for their marriage. And then--somehow there seemed
1967,CHAPTER VI.,nothing more to be said; each sat silent.
1968,CHAPTER VI.,
1969,CHAPTER VI.,"Sir John felt rather than saw his companion yawn behind her fan, and"
1970,CHAPTER VI.,realised desperately that he must break the silence.
1971,CHAPTER VI.,
1972,CHAPTER VI.,"""Ethel,"" he said gently; ""I am old compared with yourself, and grave"

1975,CHAPTER VI.,
1976,CHAPTER VI.,"She looked at him with a good deal of surprise, and a frown puckered"

1978,CHAPTER VI.,
1979,CHAPTER VI.,"""Why not? Why should we wish for rhapsodies and commonplace"
1980,CHAPTER VI.,love-making? We can leave all that to the Chloes and Daphnes of a
1981,CHAPTER VI.,by-gone age. It would be boring to the last degree. One must take
1982,CHAPTER VI.,"pleasure just as much as sorrow, with a certain amount of equanimity."
1983,CHAPTER VI.,"If there is one thing more than another that I hate, it is to be"

1985,CHAPTER VI.,
1986,CHAPTER VI.,The sword would never wear out the scabbard so far as Lady Ethel was
1987,CHAPTER VI.,concerned! He doubted if she were capable of any great depth of
1988,CHAPTER VI.,"feeling. But he did not say now as he would have done a week ago--""So"
1989,CHAPTER VI.,"much the better;"" he no longer felt that it was altogether desirable."
1990,CHAPTER VI.,
1991,CHAPTER VI.,"He looked at her more scrutinisingly than he had ever done before,"
1992,CHAPTER VI.,and for the first time he told himself that the beautifully moulded
1993,CHAPTER VI.,"mouth was hard and unloving, and that the chin spoke of self-will and"
1994,CHAPTER VI.,an amount of resolution unusual in such a young girl.
1995,CHAPTER VI.,
1996,CHAPTER VI.,He hastened to change the subject.
1997,CHAPTER VI.,
1998,CHAPTER VI.,"""You would like to visit Switzerland or Italy?"" he asked."
1999,CHAPTER VI.,
2000,CHAPTER VI.,"""No; I don't care for scenery much, or nature! I like human nature"

2003,CHAPTER VI.,
2004,CHAPTER VI.,"""Then Paris or Vienna let it be, by all means,"" he hastened to reply,"

2019,CHAPTER VI.,
2020,CHAPTER VI.,"""I only know that she was beneath him in position--a dancer, I"

2023,CHAPTER VI.,
2024,CHAPTER VI.,"""He was plain Mr. Chetwynd."""
2025,CHAPTER VI.,
2026,CHAPTER VI.,"""Yes; but already very popular. It was exceedingly fortunate that he"

2031,CHAPTER VI.,
2032,CHAPTER VI.,"""The world says not; they had lived unhappily for some time before,"

2037,CHAPTER VI.,
2038,CHAPTER VI.,"""Yes, Ethel, I did; I referred to it as delicately as possible, of"

2041,CHAPTER VI.,
2042,CHAPTER VI.,"""And what did he say?"""
2043,CHAPTER VI.,
2044,CHAPTER VI.,"""Well, he spoke very nicely; he said he was aware that it added to"

2064,CHAPTER VI.,
2065,CHAPTER VI.,Her daughter laughed.
2066,CHAPTER VI.,
2067,CHAPTER VI.,"""I certainly do not wish him to be more demonstrative, mother dear;"

2071,CHAPTER VI.,
2072,CHAPTER VI.,"""You amaze me, Ethel, by suggesting such a horrible idea. The woman"

2077,CHAPTER VI.,
2078,CHAPTER VI.,"But in this, as we know, the Duchess was in grave error."
2079,CHAPTER VI.,
2080,CHAPTER VI.,At that very moment Bella was sitting by the open piano in her cosy

2112,CHAPTER VI.,
2113,CHAPTER VI.,Bella turned quickly and looked sharply into Mr. Doss's face.
2114,CHAPTER VI.,
2115,CHAPTER VI.,"""If you have got anything disagreeable to say, don't be afraid, out"

2117,CHAPTER VI.,
2118,CHAPTER VI.,"She tried to laugh, but it was a piteous attempt, and ended in a fit"

2190,CHAPTER VI.,"his hundred dollars a week, and you turn up your nose at him. I can't"
2191,CHAPTER VI.,understand you. You seemed proud enough of him a week or two back;

2194,CHAPTER VI.,
2195,CHAPTER VI.,"""I suppose I can please myself,"" answered Bella, and her lip"

2198,CHAPTER VI.,"""I wish to God I had never left--Jack,"" she said weakly."
2199,CHAPTER VI.,
2200,CHAPTER VI.,"Whereupon Saidie gave her what she was pleased to call a ""piece of"

2203,CHAPTER VI.,"collapse, and had to be carried off to bed."
2204,CHAPTER VI.,
2205,CHAPTER VI.,"Things did not mend. Bella persisted, ill though she was, in"

2207,CHAPTER VI.,"predicted came to pass, and she received a formal notice cancelling"
2208,CHAPTER VI.,her engagement at the Empire on the ground of the extreme delicacy of
2209,CHAPTER VI.,her health.
2210,CHAPTER VI.,
2211,CHAPTER VI.,Mr. and Mrs. Doss happened to be with her at the time she received

2214,CHAPTER VI.,"""You will help me, won't you? You won't allow them to impose upon me"

2217,CHAPTER VI.,"would be ruin for me, it would simply spoil my career. I shall go"

2342,CHAPTER VI.,"end, there came the reaction."
2343,CHAPTER VI.,
2344,CHAPTER VI.,"""I think I had better go home and lie down,"" she said, ""or I shall"
2345,CHAPTER VI.,"not be at my post to-night, and I must, you know, I must."""
2346,CHAPTER VI.,
2347,CHAPTER VI.,"""Poor child, I could fairly have cried,"" said kindly Mrs. Doss to her"
2348,CHAPTER VI.,spouse after Bella had been safely escorted home.
2349,CHAPTER VI.,
2350,CHAPTER VI.,"""I'm not satisfied with you, old girl,"" said Mr. Doss, shaking his"
2351,CHAPTER VI.,"head mournfully. ""I can't 'elp thinking you might ha' managed things"
2352,CHAPTER VI.,"better. If Bella Blackall goes on a singing at the Hempire, you mark"
2353,CHAPTER VI.,"my words, she'll sing herself into 'eaven."""
2354,CHAPTER VI.,
2355,CHAPTER VI.,
2356,CHAPTER VI.,
2357,CHAPTER VI.,
2358,CHAPTER VII.,CHAPTER VII.
2359,CHAPTER VII.,
2360,CHAPTER VII.,
2361,CHAPTER VII.,"A week went by slowly: the hours crept like snails, and yet the days"
2362,CHAPTER VII.,"were surely slipping away, bringing nearer and nearer the one which"
2363,CHAPTER VII.,was to give Sir John Chetwynd his second wife.
2364,CHAPTER VII.,
2365,CHAPTER VII.,He had hardly seen Lady Ethel since the evening when she had yielded
2366,CHAPTER VII.,a coy assent to his not (it must be confessed) very amorous request
2367,CHAPTER VII.,"that she would fix an early day for their nuptials, and his state of"
2368,CHAPTER VII.,mind was anything but an enviable one. If ever a man was torn two
2369,CHAPTER VII.,"ways, halting between prudence and worldly consideration on one side"
2370,CHAPTER VII.,and the force and power of a love which he had honestly believed was
2371,CHAPTER VII.,"laid for ever in its grave, that man was Sir John. The idea of seeing"
2372,CHAPTER VII.,"Bella again did not occur to him for some days, but when it fastened"
2373,CHAPTER VII.,on him he could not shake it off. It was stronger than himself. He
2374,CHAPTER VII.,"excused his temptation by the condition of her health, though in his"
2375,CHAPTER VII.,heart of hearts he knew well enough that this was not sufficiently
2376,CHAPTER VII.,critical to serve for a reason.
2377,CHAPTER VII.,
2378,CHAPTER VII.,"Twice he seized his hat with the intention of going to her, then laid"
2379,CHAPTER VII.,"it aside, angry and disgusted with his own weakness."
2380,CHAPTER VII.,
2381,CHAPTER VII.,His profession no longer occupied his thoughts to the exclusion of
2382,CHAPTER VII.,every other topic. He sat for hours buried in the newly awakened
2383,CHAPTER VII.,"memories that that one brief glimpse of her had conjured up, unable,"
2384,CHAPTER VII.,unwilling to rouse himself.
2385,CHAPTER VII.,
2386,CHAPTER VII.,And then he made a compromise with his own weakness and irresolution.
2387,CHAPTER VII.,"He would not go to Cecil Street, since by so doing he would be"
2388,CHAPTER VII.,"offering a tacit insult to the woman he had pledged himself to marry,"
2389,CHAPTER VII.,"but he would, he must see Bella, himself unseen and his presence"
2390,CHAPTER VII.,"unsuspected, and this he could effect easily by going to the Empire."
2391,CHAPTER VII.,
2392,CHAPTER VII.,"The notion pleased him, and that self-same evening he carried it out."
2393,CHAPTER VII.,
2394,CHAPTER VII.,Bella was worse. She could no longer deceive herself. It was only by
2395,CHAPTER VII.,a superhuman effort that she could pull herself together sufficiently
2396,CHAPTER VII.,to sing the one song which was all her part consisted of now.
2397,CHAPTER VII.,
2398,CHAPTER VII.,After she had got into her pretty sea-green skirts of lace and tulle
2399,CHAPTER VII.,"and shimmering silk, like so much sea foam, she had to lie still and,"
2400,CHAPTER VII.,"let the poor over-strained lungs and heart recover themselves, and"
2401,CHAPTER VII.,"then, when the summons came she called up a smile to her wan face and"
2402,CHAPTER VII.,pluckily did her best.
2403,CHAPTER VII.,
2404,CHAPTER VII.,But that night she looked up at Saidie after the last ribbon was in
2405,CHAPTER VII.,its place.
2406,CHAPTER VII.,
2407,CHAPTER VII.,"""I'll have to throw up the sponge, after all,"" she said wearily; ""it"
2408,CHAPTER VII.,"is beyond me. They are right and I was wrong,--I must have a rest."""
2409,CHAPTER VII.,
2410,CHAPTER VII.,"Saidie muttered something in reply, but when the door closed upon her"
2411,CHAPTER VII.,"sister, she sighed."
2412,CHAPTER VII.,
2413,CHAPTER VII.,"""She _is_ bad; there is no denying it,"" remarked the dresser, who was"
2414,CHAPTER VII.,busily stroking out the roses which were to garland Saidie's dress.
2415,CHAPTER VII.,"""It gives me a turn every time I see her go on the stage."""
2416,CHAPTER VII.,
2417,CHAPTER VII.,"""She looks worse than she really is,"" returned Saidie; ""sometimes she"
2418,CHAPTER VII.,"is as brisk and lively as you like--she so soon gets tired."""
2419,CHAPTER VII.,
2420,CHAPTER VII.,"""She is a tidy sight worse than 'tired,' and it strikes me her voice"
2421,CHAPTER VII.,"was weak like to-night. Did you notice it, Miss?"""
2422,CHAPTER VII.,
2423,CHAPTER VII.,"""Oh, she varies so. I guess she would be as right as any of us the"
2424,CHAPTER VII.,"moment she was on the boards."""
2425,CHAPTER VII.,
2426,CHAPTER VII.,"Nevertheless, although she was not going to confess it, Saidie was"
2427,CHAPTER VII.,troubled and uneasy. There was something in Bella's face she had not
2428,CHAPTER VII.,"seen before, and it frightened her--a little. She stood at the wings"
2429,CHAPTER VII.,"with a quick-beating heart, but the next moment laughed at her own"
2430,CHAPTER VII.,fears.
2431,CHAPTER VII.,
2432,CHAPTER VII.,"Bella was singing her very best. Not a falter in the clear, bell-like"
2433,CHAPTER VII.,"tones, and her face was smiling and radiant."
2434,CHAPTER VII.,
2435,CHAPTER VII.,And then--her eyes fastened themselves on a box in the grand tier;
2436,CHAPTER VII.,"with a scared expression she shrank back a little, and her lip"
2437,CHAPTER VII.,"quivered, but with a mighty effort she controlled herself and caught"
2438,CHAPTER VII.,"up the refrain again--carolled a word or two, faltered, swayed"
2439,CHAPTER VII.,"helplessly, uncertainly forward, and fell headlong on the stage."
2440,CHAPTER VII.,
2441,CHAPTER VII.,"They were round her in a second, lifting her gently and tenderly. Her"
2442,CHAPTER VII.,head had fallen back and a thin stream of blood was welling over the
2443,CHAPTER VII.,laces at her bosom.
2444,CHAPTER VII.,
2445,CHAPTER VII.,"""She is dead!"" cried Saidie. ""Oh, will someone fetch a doctor,"
2446,CHAPTER VII.,"quick!"""
2447,CHAPTER VII.,
2448,CHAPTER VII.,"But almost before the words were spoken he was there, and when Bella"
2449,CHAPTER VII.,"opened her eyes they fell on the grave, anxious, kindly face of the"
2450,CHAPTER VII.,man whose wife she had been.
2451,CHAPTER VII.,
2452,CHAPTER VII.,"""Jack! Jack! is this--the end?"""
2453,CHAPTER VII.,
2454,CHAPTER VII.,"""Hush--no--no! Keep still--perfectly still--you must not move."""
2455,CHAPTER VII.,
2456,CHAPTER VII.,"""I am not--in pain--a little dizzy--nothing more, and my head feels"
2457,CHAPTER VII.,"light."""
2458,CHAPTER VII.,
2459,CHAPTER VII.,"""Drink this and don't talk. As soon as you are a little recovered we"
2460,CHAPTER VII.,"will go home."""
2461,CHAPTER VII.,
2462,CHAPTER VII.,"""Home! Jack!"""
2463,CHAPTER VII.,
2464,CHAPTER VII.,"Oh, the wistful look in the deep blue eyes--the prophetic droop about"
2465,CHAPTER VII.,the perfect mouth! It was almost more than he could bear.
2466,CHAPTER VII.,
2467,CHAPTER VII.,"""I will go with you myself if you will do what I tell you, keep"
2468,CHAPTER VII.,"absolutely quiet--your life depends upon it."""
2469,CHAPTER VII.,
2470,CHAPTER VII.,She looked up tremulously.
2471,CHAPTER VII.,
2472,CHAPTER VII.,"""I don't care--a--cent _now_,"" she whispered."
2473,CHAPTER VII.,
2474,CHAPTER VII.,"She bore the journey to Cecil Street better than they could hope, and"
2475,CHAPTER VII.,the bleeding from the lungs had ceased.
2476,CHAPTER VII.,
2477,CHAPTER VII.,Downstairs Saidie expressed a wish to remain all night with her
2478,CHAPTER VII.,sister.
2479,CHAPTER VII.,
2480,CHAPTER VII.,"""She ought not to be left,"" she said."
2481,CHAPTER VII.,
2482,CHAPTER VII.,"""Most decidedly she must not be left,"" replied Sir John--""I intend"
2483,CHAPTER VII.,"remaining with your sister."""
2484,CHAPTER VII.,
2485,CHAPTER VII.,"""You! Well, this beats all, upon my word!"""
2486,CHAPTER VII.,
2487,CHAPTER VII.,So great was Miss Blackall's surprise that when she found herself
2488,CHAPTER VII.,ousted from the position of head nurse and the door metaphorically
2489,CHAPTER VII.,"closed upon her, she had not a word to say, but called a hansom and"
2490,CHAPTER VII.,"had herself driven to Bayswater, where she had been living since her"
2491,CHAPTER VII.,"mother's death, now nearly a year ago."
2492,CHAPTER VII.,
2493,CHAPTER VII.,"""And I used to think he didn't amount to a row of pins,"" she murmured"
2494,CHAPTER VII.,"with an odd sort of penitence. ""Well, I guess I was wrong, that's"
2495,CHAPTER VII.,"all."""
2496,CHAPTER VII.,
2497,CHAPTER VII.,Through the long hours of that never-ending night John Chetwynd
2498,CHAPTER VII.,"watched by Bella's bedside. For the most part, she lay mute and"
2499,CHAPTER VII.,"inert, but towards morning she grew restless."
2500,CHAPTER VII.,
2501,CHAPTER VII.,"""I must talk,"" she cried excitedly--""to see you sit there and to"
2502,CHAPTER VII.,"think--to remember--oh! if only I had run straight, Jack--I don't"
2503,CHAPTER VII.,"think I was meant for this, do you?"""
2504,CHAPTER VII.,
2505,CHAPTER VII.,He had no words with which to answer her. He folded his arms across
2506,CHAPTER VII.,his chest and looked out vaguely into the slant of room beyond. The
2507,CHAPTER VII.,folding doors were open and on the sideboard he could see a basket
2508,CHAPTER VII.,"full of peaches, at this season an extravagance denied his own table."
2509,CHAPTER VII.,On the mantelshelf to his right hand were some exquisite hot-house
2510,CHAPTER VII.,"flowers, carelessly crushed into a cracked, cheap little vase, and a"
2511,CHAPTER VII.,penny packet of stationery and a powder puff in a sprinkling of
2512,CHAPTER VII.,chalk.
2513,CHAPTER VII.,
2514,CHAPTER VII.,"She stretched out her arms so that her fingers touched him, and he"
2515,CHAPTER VII.,held them tightly in his own--rings and all.
2516,CHAPTER VII.,
2517,CHAPTER VII.,She was never meant for the life she had chosen!
2518,CHAPTER VII.,
2519,CHAPTER VII.,His heart felt breaking.
2520,CHAPTER VII.,
2521,CHAPTER VII.,"The delicate features, the sweet, wistful, childish face, the pathos"
2522,CHAPTER VII.,in her regretful cry--the past with its load of gall and shame and
2523,CHAPTER VII.,misery--which could never be obliterated. Never!
2524,CHAPTER VII.,
2525,CHAPTER VII.,"""Why do you look at me like that? I am better. I know I am better. I"
2526,CHAPTER VII.,thought--I feared--I was going to die; if I had there was no one to
2527,CHAPTER VII.,"care but--Saidie."""
2528,CHAPTER VII.,
2529,CHAPTER VII.,"""Do you not think what it would mean to--me?"""
2530,CHAPTER VII.,
2531,CHAPTER VII.,The words broke from him against his will.
2532,CHAPTER VII.,
2533,CHAPTER VII.,"""To--you, Jack! then you care--still!"""
2534,CHAPTER VII.,
2535,CHAPTER VII.,"""Care!"""
2536,CHAPTER VII.,
2537,CHAPTER VII.,He drew his hand away and walked over to the window. The morning was
2538,CHAPTER VII.,breaking: morning in the Strand; and already there was a busy hum
2539,CHAPTER VII.,without.
2540,CHAPTER VII.,
2541,CHAPTER VII.,"Her eyes followed him wistfully, with a little wonderment in"
2542,CHAPTER VII.,them--and then the lids fell over them.
2543,CHAPTER VII.,
2544,CHAPTER VII.,"""I feel strangely weak--but--so--happy, Jack,"" she said. Her breath"
2545,CHAPTER VII.,came more easily and she slept.
2546,CHAPTER VII.,
2547,CHAPTER VII.,"Sir John Chetwynd was in his accustomed place at the accustomed hour,"
2548,CHAPTER VII.,"grave, attentive and professional as was his wont; but after his"
2549,CHAPTER VII.,"consulting hours were over, he went back to Cecil Street, leaving"
2550,CHAPTER VII.,"word with Soames where he was to be found, if wanted, prepared for"
2551,CHAPTER VII.,another night's vigil.
2552,CHAPTER VII.,
2553,CHAPTER VII.,"""She seems neither better nor worse,"" said Saidie, meeting him in the"
2554,CHAPTER VII.,little sitting-room and carefully pulling to the door behind her.
2555,CHAPTER VII.,"""She is very, very weak. Is there a chance for her?"""
2556,CHAPTER VII.,
2557,CHAPTER VII.,"""I am afraid to say--it depends so much on what recuperative power"
2558,CHAPTER VII.,"she has. If the bleeding can be stopped, I shall be more hopeful."""
2559,CHAPTER VII.,
2560,CHAPTER VII.,"""What is she to do, poor Bella? She will never be able to sing again,"
2561,CHAPTER VII.,"I suppose?"""
2562,CHAPTER VII.,
2563,CHAPTER VII.,"""Never."" He spoke curtly, almost cruelly. Saidie burst into tears."
2564,CHAPTER VII.,
2565,CHAPTER VII.,At that moment came a smart tap at the door.
2566,CHAPTER VII.,
2567,CHAPTER VII.,"""Mr. Bolingbroke, Miss,"" said a voice from without."
2568,CHAPTER VII.,
2569,CHAPTER VII.,"""He can't come up."" Saidie sprang from her chair. But she was too"
2570,CHAPTER VII.,"late. The handle turned, and a tall, distinctly good-looking man"
2571,CHAPTER VII.,walked in.
2572,CHAPTER VII.,
2573,CHAPTER VII.,"""Miss Blackhall--how unkind to deny me admittance. You must know how"
2574,CHAPTER VII.,"fearfully anxious I am. How is she?"""
2575,CHAPTER VII.,
2576,CHAPTER VII.,"""There's the doctor--ask him."""
2577,CHAPTER VII.,
2578,CHAPTER VII.,The stranger turned eagerly.
2579,CHAPTER VII.,
2580,CHAPTER VII.,"""This is not serious, I trust. She was always delicate, but--it is"
2581,CHAPTER VII.,"wonderful how she pulls together when the worst is over."""
2582,CHAPTER VII.,
2583,CHAPTER VII.,For almost the first time in his life John Chetwynd was tongue-tied.
2584,CHAPTER VII.,
2585,CHAPTER VII.,"Who and what was this man, and what was he to Bella? He forced"
2586,CHAPTER VII.,"himself to give a professional opinion, and answered mechanically a"
2587,CHAPTER VII.,"string of questions Mr. Bolingbroke poured forth, but he hardly knew"
2588,CHAPTER VII.,what he was saying.
2589,CHAPTER VII.,
2590,CHAPTER VII.,"""If only she gets over this she shall never be bothered any more,"
2591,CHAPTER VII.,"poor darling,"" he said brokenly. ""I suppose I can go in, eh?"""
2592,CHAPTER VII.,
2593,CHAPTER VII.,His hand was on the door--John Chetwynd sprang to his feet.
2594,CHAPTER VII.,
2595,CHAPTER VII.,"""No one must see her,"" he cried excitedly. ""I absolutely forbid it."
2596,CHAPTER VII.,"It would be most dangerous--most improper."""
2597,CHAPTER VII.,
2598,CHAPTER VII.,The two men looked into each other's faces for the space of several
2599,CHAPTER VII.,seconds; then Mr. Bolingbroke turned away with a sigh and an
2600,CHAPTER VII.,"impatient word. ""Absurd! As if I could do her any harm,"" he said."
2601,CHAPTER VII.,"""Well, I will be round again later in the day,"" he added with a nod"
2602,CHAPTER VII.,"to Saidie, and a minute later the hall door shut upon him."
2603,CHAPTER VII.,
2604,CHAPTER VII.,"""Who is that man?"" asked Sir John sternly."
2605,CHAPTER VII.,
2606,CHAPTER VII.,Saidie shrugged her shoulders.
2607,CHAPTER VII.,
2608,CHAPTER VII.,"""You shall tell me--what is he to Bella?"""
2609,CHAPTER VII.,
2610,CHAPTER VII.,"""He is a good and noble man, and let me tell you there ain't too many"
2611,CHAPTER VII.,knocking around. If she lives to get over this he will make her his
2612,CHAPTER VII.,"wife."""
2613,CHAPTER VII.,
2614,CHAPTER VII.,And there was silence--a silence in which John Chetwynd read clearly
2615,CHAPTER VII.,"his own heart at last, and stood face to face with facts--facts"
2616,CHAPTER VII.,"stripped of false adornments--naked, convincing."
2617,CHAPTER VII.,
2618,CHAPTER VII.,Then he strode across the room and entered that in which Bella lay.
2619,CHAPTER VII.,
2620,CHAPTER VII.,"She was asleep, and he drew his chair close to the bedside and fixed"
2621,CHAPTER VII.,"his eyes on the wan, thin face, fever flushed, and fought the"
2622,CHAPTER VII.,fiercest battle of his life with his inner self; and when the
2623,CHAPTER VII.,"struggle was over, Pride lay in tatters and Love was conqueror."
2624,CHAPTER VII.,
2625,CHAPTER VII.,She slept at intervals almost the whole of that day. Waking late in
2626,CHAPTER VII.,"the afternoon, her eyes fell on the silent watcher by her side, and"
2627,CHAPTER VII.,"she smiled happily, contentedly."
2628,CHAPTER VII.,
2629,CHAPTER VII.,Saidie bent over her and whispered a word or two.
2630,CHAPTER VII.,
2631,CHAPTER VII.,"""No--no,"" cried Bella vehemently; ""send him away. I don't want to see"
2632,CHAPTER VII.,"him."""
2633,CHAPTER VII.,
2634,CHAPTER VII.,"""But he is so anxious, dear."""
2635,CHAPTER VII.,
2636,CHAPTER VII.,"""Is he?--poor Charlie! Tell him I am in no pain, and I should like to"
2637,CHAPTER VII.,"think he will never quite forget me."""
2638,CHAPTER VII.,
2639,CHAPTER VII.,"""He will never do that,"" said Saidie, going away with her message but"
2640,CHAPTER VII.,"half satisfied, and Bella turned a flushed cheek to her pillow."
2641,CHAPTER VII.,
2642,CHAPTER VII.,"And then, for the second time, John Chetwynd asked, ""Who is that"
2643,CHAPTER VII.,"man?"""
2644,CHAPTER VII.,
2645,CHAPTER VII.,And Bella tried feebly to tell him. He had been attached to her for a
2646,CHAPTER VII.,"long time, and had come over with her from the States."
2647,CHAPTER VII.,
2648,CHAPTER VII.,"""And you--did you mean to marry him, Bella?"""
2649,CHAPTER VII.,
2650,CHAPTER VII.,"""I had thought of it--it seemed suicidal to say no to such an offer,"
2651,CHAPTER VII.,"and then I--oh, Jack, when I saw you I knew I could never love any"
2652,CHAPTER VII.,"other man!"""
2653,CHAPTER VII.,
2654,CHAPTER VII.,He poured out a draught and held it to her trembling lips.
2655,CHAPTER VII.,
2656,CHAPTER VII.,"""I feel so strangely weak,"" she said; ""you are going to marry Ethel,"
2657,CHAPTER VII.,"and I am nothing to you now?"""
2658,CHAPTER VII.,
2659,CHAPTER VII.,"John Chetwynd drew her close to him, so that the tired head rested on"
2660,CHAPTER VII.,his shoulder with the sweet familiarity of long ago.
2661,CHAPTER VII.,
2662,CHAPTER VII.,"""Listen,"" he said. ""I have been a coward, frightened of the truth."
2663,CHAPTER VII.,"The world was dearer to me than happiness, or I thought so, and I"
2664,CHAPTER VII.,"hesitated, afraid of its contempt. But amid my weakness was one"
2665,CHAPTER VII.,"thought, one impulse, which no amount of worldly prudence or"
2666,CHAPTER VII.,"consideration could stifle, and Bella--my wife--that was my love for"
2667,CHAPTER VII.,"you."""
2668,CHAPTER VII.,
2669,CHAPTER VII.,"""Jack, Jack, is it true?"""
2670,CHAPTER VII.,
2671,CHAPTER VII.,"""I have loved you always, through all my life, you and no other. I"
2672,CHAPTER VII.,see now how hard I must have seemed to you and how wild and
2673,CHAPTER VII.,unreasonable I was in my expectation from you and how at last it
2674,CHAPTER VII.,drove you from my side. The shame of it is not more yours than mine.
2675,CHAPTER VII.,"We both erred, we both sinned; but I was older and should have been"
2676,CHAPTER VII.,wiser; the burden of it should fall on me. The world is nothing to me
2677,CHAPTER VII.,now--less than nothing. Let us take up life where we broke it off.
2678,CHAPTER VII.,"Give me back the past, which held for me all of happiness I have ever"
2679,CHAPTER VII.,"known."""
2680,CHAPTER VII.,
2681,CHAPTER VII.,"She lay with a smile of peace upon her face, both hands clinging to"
2682,CHAPTER VII.,his.
2683,CHAPTER VII.,
2684,CHAPTER VII.,"""I have communed with myself and thought it well out, and I believe"
2685,CHAPTER VII.,"that to bind my life, with its memories of you, to the girl to whom I"
2686,CHAPTER VII.,"am engaged, would be a cruel wrong and an injustice to her. She"
2687,CHAPTER VII.,"deserves a better fate, and I honestly feel that the rupture will not"
2688,CHAPTER VII.,"grieve her much. We will remarry, you and I. I will take you away"
2689,CHAPTER VII.,"from England, I will guard and cherish you, and in my love for you,"
2690,CHAPTER VII.,"you will grow stronger. Oh! my darling, my darling, if you knew what"
2691,CHAPTER VII.,"life has been to me since you went; how I have blamed myself,--I who"
2692,CHAPTER VII.,"ought to have shielded you against yourself, and have been a moral"
2693,CHAPTER VII.,backbone to your weakness. Then as time went on I persuaded myself
2694,CHAPTER VII.,"that I had succeeded in putting you out of my heart,--that I had"
2695,CHAPTER VII.,"forgotten you,--and then--you came back to me, and the past leapt"
2696,CHAPTER VII.,"living from the years that had no power to bury it, and I knew that"
2697,CHAPTER VII.,you were more to me than honour or fame or anything the world held.
2698,CHAPTER VII.,"Hence-forth I will be so gentle with you, so tender--so loving."""
2699,CHAPTER VII.,
2700,CHAPTER VII.,"""Will you--kiss me--Jack?"""
2701,CHAPTER VII.,
2702,CHAPTER VII.,She had gradually pulled herself upright on the pillows.
2703,CHAPTER VII.,
2704,CHAPTER VII.,"""Will you kiss me--and say--once more, as you used to--'God bless"
2705,CHAPTER VII.,"you--wifie'?"""
2706,CHAPTER VII.,
2707,CHAPTER VII.,Their lips met and clung together.
2708,CHAPTER VII.,
2709,CHAPTER VII.,"""God bless you--wifie."""
2710,CHAPTER VII.,
2711,CHAPTER VII.,"And there was silence, a long silence, broken by a gasp, a sigh, and"

2738,SOUTHAMPTON.,"Here am I on Jack's yacht, anchored in Southampton waters. The weather"
2739,SOUTHAMPTON.,"is perfect, and I am having a very good time. Jack's mother is on"
2740,SOUTHAMPTON.,"board, and is really devoted to me. I am a lucky girl to have such a"
2741,SOUTHAMPTON.,sweet mother-in-law in prospective. She is the dearest old lady in the
2742,SOUTHAMPTON.,world. The wedding has been decided upon for the last week in
2743,SOUTHAMPTON.,"September, so I suppose that I shall have to come back to town before"
2744,SOUTHAMPTON.,very long to see about my trousseau.
2745,SOUTHAMPTON.,
2746,SOUTHAMPTON.,There is really nothing so bewildering to anyone who sees it for the
2747,SOUTHAMPTON.,first time as the exquisite order and dainty perfection of a yacht in
2748,SOUTHAMPTON.,"which its owner takes a pride, and can afford to gratify his whim. And"
2749,SOUTHAMPTON.,this is the case with Jack. The deck shines like polished parquet. The
2750,SOUTHAMPTON.,"sails and ropes are faultlessly clean, and Jack says that the masts"
2751,SOUTHAMPTON.,have just been scraped and the funnel repainted. The brass nails and
2752,SOUTHAMPTON.,the binnacle are as perfectly in order as if they were costly
2753,SOUTHAMPTON.,instruments in an optician's window. There is a small deck cargo of
2754,SOUTHAMPTON.,"coal in white canvas sacks, with leather straps and handles. And there"
2755,SOUTHAMPTON.,is the deck-house with its plate-glass windows and velvet fittings and
2756,SOUTHAMPTON.,spring-blinds.
2757,SOUTHAMPTON.,
2758,SOUTHAMPTON.,"Soon after I arrived I went down into the engine-room, where I saw"
2759,SOUTHAMPTON.,machinery as scrupulously clean as if it were part of some gigantic
2760,SOUTHAMPTON.,watch which a grain of dust might throw out of gear. On the deck are
2761,SOUTHAMPTON.,delightful P. and O. lounges with their arms doing duty for small
2762,SOUTHAMPTON.,"tables. All around the wheel and upon the roof of the deck-house, and"
2763,SOUTHAMPTON.,"here and there on stands against the bulwarks, there are ranged in"
2764,SOUTHAMPTON.,"pots, bright red geraniums contrasted with the yellow calceolaria, and"
2765,SOUTHAMPTON.,"the deliriously scented heliotrope. Altogether, everything is charming."
2766,SOUTHAMPTON.,
2767,SOUTHAMPTON.,"We go delightful trips every day, and it doesn't matter whether there"
2768,SOUTHAMPTON.,"is a favourable wind or not, as Jack's is a steam yacht. We have slept"
2769,SOUTHAMPTON.,"on board except one night when it was rather rough, and then Mrs."
2770,SOUTHAMPTON.,Vivian and I stayed at the South Western Hotel.
2771,SOUTHAMPTON.,
2772,SOUTHAMPTON.,Altogether I am enjoying myself more than I have ever done in my life.

2800,SOUTHAMPTON.,
2801,SOUTHAMPTON.,Mrs. Tenterden has set her cap at Jack! He has--I  know it--fallen
2802,SOUTHAMPTON.,under the spell of the enchantress. And she is an enchantress. She is a
2803,SOUTHAMPTON.,"woman of about thirty, tall, fair, with striking features, lovely eyes,"
2804,SOUTHAMPTON.,and the most superb complexion I have ever seen. The best complexion I
2805,SOUTHAMPTON.,ever recollect was that of a peasant girl's at Ivy Bridge in
2806,SOUTHAMPTON.,"Devonshire, but hers was nothing to compare with Mrs. Tenterden's. It"
2807,SOUTHAMPTON.,is perfect. I can say no more.
2808,SOUTHAMPTON.,
2809,SOUTHAMPTON.,"Then she is extremely amusing, being a brilliant talker (for I heard"
2810,SOUTHAMPTON.,Jack say so) and very witty (for he is constantly laughing at the
2811,SOUTHAMPTON.,"things she says, and which for the most part I don't understand)."
2812,SOUTHAMPTON.,
2813,SOUTHAMPTON.,"But this I know, that since her advent I have changed from the happiest"
2814,SOUTHAMPTON.,girl in the world into one of the most miserable.
2815,SOUTHAMPTON.,
2816,SOUTHAMPTON.,"Mrs. Tenterden is the widow of Colonel Tenterden, who was a brother"
2817,SOUTHAMPTON.,"officer of Jack's father, Colonel Vivian. Her husband died in India"
2818,SOUTHAMPTON.,"about six months ago, and she has lately returned to England. Jack had"
2819,SOUTHAMPTON.,"never seen her before, but Mrs. Vivian, who knew her as a young girl,"
2820,SOUTHAMPTON.,asked her down here.
2821,SOUTHAMPTON.,
2822,SOUTHAMPTON.,"She has made a dead set at Jack, and I feel (I can't help it) that he"

2824,SOUTHAMPTON.,"has entirely changed. He is not my darling, loving Jack, at all, but"
2825,SOUTHAMPTON.,merely a polite friend.
2826,SOUTHAMPTON.,
2827,SOUTHAMPTON.,Mrs. Vivian must be blind not to see what is going on. But I cannot

2870,"DEAREST LILY,","yacht, and a ripper it is. That is to say, I am on the yacht in the"

2878,"DEAREST LILY,",clear about it himself--hasn't got a chance with me. What Jack Vivian
2879,"DEAREST LILY,",could have ever seen in her I can't guess. She is the usual type of

2884,"DEAREST LILY,",Mrs. Vivian--Jack's mother--seems not to have the remotest idea how

2992,"DEAREST AMY,","which runs into Southampton Water. Well, we started--Jack, and a friend"

2994,"DEAREST AMY,","went well for about an hour, when a breeze sprang up which soon"
2995,"DEAREST AMY,",developed into half a gale. At least I understood the captain of the
2996,"DEAREST AMY,","yacht to say so. I didn't mind it in the least, but Mrs. Vivian, poor"
2997,"DEAREST AMY,","old lady, was dreadfully ill and nervous, and though I did all I could"
2998,"DEAREST AMY,","to comfort and reassure her, it was not of much use. As for Mrs."
2999,"DEAREST AMY,","Tenterden, she absolutely collapsed. In abject terror she uttered"
3000,"DEAREST AMY,","incoherent cries, and no one could make out what she wished to be done."
3001,"DEAREST AMY,","Jack seemed very upset and tried to soothe her as well as he could, but"
3002,"DEAREST AMY,","it was all to no effect, and indeed she once turned on him just like a"
3003,"DEAREST AMY,","virago, saying,"
3004,"DEAREST AMY,",
3005,"DEAREST AMY,","""I never wanted to come on your horrid yacht, but you would make me,"

3007,"DEAREST AMY,",
3008,"DEAREST AMY,","Poor Jack--I call him ""Poor Jack"" although he has behaved like a very"

3010,"DEAREST AMY,",
3011,"DEAREST AMY,","Eventually we arrived opposite the village of Hamble, and there the"
3012,"DEAREST AMY,",anchor was weighed--if that is the right expression. Jack suggested
3013,"DEAREST AMY,","that the three ladies, including myself, should go ashore in the dingey"
3014,"DEAREST AMY,",and stay at the hotel. Mrs. Vivian said that she did not want to do
3015,"DEAREST AMY,","this, and Mrs. Tenterden positively refused."
3016,"DEAREST AMY,",
3017,"DEAREST AMY,","""Do you think that I am going to risk my life that jim-crack boat?"" she"
3018,"DEAREST AMY,","asked. ""I am not quite an imbecile. Though I think I must be after all,"

3020,"DEAREST AMY,",
3021,"DEAREST AMY,","Jack again made no reply, but there was something in his face that told"
3022,"DEAREST AMY,",me that he was becoming disillusioned.
3023,"DEAREST AMY,",
3024,"DEAREST AMY,","Shortly after that he sent the skipper and a boy ashore, who returned"
3025,"DEAREST AMY,",with some marvellous looking lobsters and a huge crab. It seems that
3026,"DEAREST AMY,","this place is famous for its shell-fish, and I can only say that I"
3027,"DEAREST AMY,",never tasted anything more delicious than the crab in question.
3028,"DEAREST AMY,",
3029,"DEAREST AMY,","Mrs. Vivian managed to eat a little dinner, but Mrs. Tenterden retired"
3030,"DEAREST AMY,",to her cabin and contented herself with some soup.
3031,"DEAREST AMY,",
3032,"DEAREST AMY,","I for my part, ate a most capital dinner, and I fancied that Jack"

3034,"DEAREST AMY,","which I should never have put up with, except from a man whom I love so"
3035,"DEAREST AMY,","devotedly--a man whom I meant to rescue (selfishly, I admit) from that"

3042,"DEAREST AMY,",
3043,"DEAREST AMY,","Mrs. Tenterden was not present at breakfast, and came on deck very"
3044,"DEAREST AMY,","late. And only imagine, my dear, how she had changed. That beautiful"
3045,"DEAREST AMY,","pink complexion that I had admired so much, and even envied, had"
3046,"DEAREST AMY,","disappeared altogether. Her face was of a greyish hue, and possessed no"
3047,"DEAREST AMY,",shade of pink. Those beautiful pencilled eyebrows seemed to have
3048,"DEAREST AMY,","strangely altered, and to have unaccountably thinned down. The charming"
3049,"DEAREST AMY,","woman-of-the-world manner had entirely disappeared, and, later on, when"
3050,"DEAREST AMY,","we descended to the cabin, at luncheon time, Mrs. Tenterden cast"
3051,"DEAREST AMY,",furtive and certainly not reassuring glances at the little mirror
3052,"DEAREST AMY,",hanging there.
3053,"DEAREST AMY,",
3054,"DEAREST AMY,","I confess that at first I was a wee bit sorry for her, but after all,"
3055,"DEAREST AMY,","this Nemesis was thoroughly deserved, and when I saw the impression"
3056,"DEAREST AMY,",that the metamorphosis had made on Jack--the darling goose can't

3265,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"recollect at the grammar school in Cambridgeshire, where I received a"

3270,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"for he was a dull, stupid, and pompous man, possessing much more force"

3276,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"Well, this is how I appear in my own eyes. A strong, healthy man with"

3278,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"blunt manner, and with an entire absence of tact in anything in which"

3281,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"my dear parents, I have always recognised the fact that in business and"
3282,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,in everything else the truth always pays the best. During the sixteen
3283,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,years that I have devoted to business I have endeavoured to act
3284,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,squarely and fairly with everyone with whom I have been brought in
3285,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"contact, and I may say without conceit that I have earned a good name"

3291,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,and partly to the fact that up to the time I met Marie Dalmayne I have
3292,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,never cared for a woman. I came across the girl that I have grown to
3293,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,love so well in this fashion. I am interested in a West Australian mine
3294,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"to the extent of about a hundred thousand pounds, and am one of the"

3300,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"I took Miss Dalmayne down to dinner, and I think that my heart went out"

3302,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,apparently little of the frivolity which characterises most of the
3303,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"young women with whom I have been brought in contact. Her conversation,"
3304,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"if not absolutely brilliant, was at any rate bright and amusing, and"
3305,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,possessed a considerable amount of shrewdness.
3306,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,
3307,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"Miss Dalmayne was about twenty-three, tall and fair,' possessing a"

3313,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,Next morning I ascertained from Adam Ross full particulars in reference
3314,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,to Miss Dalmayne. She is the only daughter of the Honourable George
3315,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"Dalmayne, and is related to many of the highest English families. Mr."
3316,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"Dalmayne and his wife are not well off, and the former is very much in"
3317,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,debt and has taxed the generosity of my friend Ross to a very
3318,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,considerable extent. The Dalmaynes live in a small house in Eaton
3319,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"Terrace. They have only one other child, and that is a son who is in"
3320,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,the Army and is at present with his regiment in India.
3321,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,
3322,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,There are some people that one feels one can confide in in matters of a
3323,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"delicate nature, and there are others to whom one could never open"
3324,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"one's mouth. Now, Ross and I have been friends for ten years, during"
3325,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,which time we have never had the least difference. He is a man
3326,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,absolutely to be trusted. I told him during this interview what a deep
3327,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,impression Miss Dalmayne had made upon me. He said that he did not in
3328,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"the least wonder at it, for she was greatly admired, and added that if"
3329,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,it were not for her father she would no doubt have made a brilliant
3330,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,marriage already. I told my friend that I cared nothing about her
3331,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"father, that I was not marrying him but his daughter--that is to say,"
3332,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,if I were fortunate enough to induce her to become my wife.
3333,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,
3334,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"""I don't think that there is much fear of a failure,"" answered Ross,"
3335,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"""old Dalmayne is looking out for a rich husband for Marie. Indeed, in a"
3336,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,confidential mood one day recently he told me almost as much himself.
3337,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"And he is not likely in a hurry to find one so rich as yourself."""
3338,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,
3339,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"""Well, I shall call upon him to-morrow,"" said I, ""and ask his"

3341,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,
3342,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"""I wish you every success, my dear friend,"" said Ross, ""and I have no"
3343,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,doubt as to the result of your interview. And I don't see why you
3344,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"should not be very happy. After all, as you say, you are not marrying"
3345,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"the father. You are marrying Marie, who is a very high-principled girl,"
3346,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"who is beautiful, who is accomplished, and who would, I am certain, do"

3349,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"And so it was settled, and next morning I called on Mr. Dalmayne."

3351,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"Mr. Dalmayne, a tall, aristocratic man of about sixty, received me with"

3354,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,old gentleman did not seem to be the least surprised when I told him
3355,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,what the object of my visit was.
3356,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,
3357,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"""Mr. Dalmayne,"" said I, ""you will doubtless be wondering why I have"
3358,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"called to see you""--Mr. Dalmayne's face assumed a sphinx-like"
3359,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,expression--I will not keep you waiting for an explanation. The truth
3360,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,is that I have fallen in love with your daughter. Our mutual friend
3361,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"Adam Ross can tell you all about me, and I don't think that his report"
3362,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,would be an unfavourable one. My position is this. I have saved three
3363,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"hundred thousand pounds, which produces an income of about twelve"
3364,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,thousand a year. And I am making at least another twenty thousand a
3365,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,year from my share of our mine and other sound enterprises. Should you
3366,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"permit me to address Miss Dalmayne, and should I be happy and fortunate"
3367,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"enough to induce her to become my wife, I should propose to settle two"

3369,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,
3370,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"""Your proposals are most generous,"" said Mr. Dalmayne, ""and do you"
3371,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,credit. But in matters of this kind I should never dream of attempting
3372,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"to control my daughter. You have, however, my full permission to speak"
3373,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"to her, and if she is willing to marry you, you both have my full"
3374,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,consent. My wife shares my views entirely. Marie is out with her mother
3375,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"at the present moment, but she will be in all the afternoon, and if you"
3376,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,will call about four I will see that you have the opportunity for which
3377,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"you are seeking."""
3378,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,
3379,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,I thanked Mr. Dalmayne most cordially and promised to return in the
3380,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,afternoon. When I again arrived at Eaton Terrace I was shown into the
3381,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"drawing-room, where I found Mrs. and Miss Dalmayne and a sister of Mrs."
3382,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"Dalmayne's. Tea was brought in, and shortly afterwards the visitor took"
3383,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,her departure. A few minutes later Mrs. Dalmayne made some excuse for
3384,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"leaving the room, and I was left alone with Marie. My heart had beaten"
3385,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"hard from excitement as I had knocked at the door, but strange to say I"
3386,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,felt no nervousness now. I plunged into the matter that brought me
3387,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,without delay. I told Miss Dalmayne of the wonderful effect produced
3388,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"upon me by her beauty and charm, and in the fewest words possible I"
3389,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"asked her to be my wife, promising that she would never repent it."
3390,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,
3391,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"""You have done me a great honour,"" said Miss Dalmayne, ""but I must have"

3394,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,
3395,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"I shortly afterwards took my leave, and departed buoyed up by the"

3397,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,
3398,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,Nor was I disappointed. On the day she had promised I received a letter
3399,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"from Miss Dalmayne saying that she was willing to accept me, but"
3400,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"frankly confessing that she had no love for me as yet, though admitting"

3402,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"this understanding, I am ready to be your wife."""
3403,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,
3404,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"Needless to say I was willing to accept these terms, and three months"
3405,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,afterwards we were man and wife.
3406,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,
3407,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"It was in the month of July that we were married, and we went to"
3408,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,Aix-les-Bains for the honeymoon. A few days previously Mr. Dalmayne
3409,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"asked me to lend him a thousand pounds, which I did cheerfully, for"
3410,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,after what my friend Ross had told me I was fully prepared for such a
3411,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,request.
3412,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,
3413,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"My wife had never been to Aix before, and seemed to amuse herself very"
3414,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"much. She played a little at the tables, and with a considerable amount"
3415,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"of success. I must admit that she was very kind to me, and though of"
3416,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,course I easily saw that I did not at present possess her real
3417,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"affection, I was not discontented, and hoped for the time to come when"
3418,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,we should be all in all to each other. We had met very few
3419,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"acquaintances at Aix, for it was not a good season as far as English"
3420,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"visitors were concerned, owing to attacks on our country and Government"
3421,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,by the French papers. But when we had been there about three weeks a
3422,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"Captain Morland came upon the scene. Captain Morland, who was an"
3423,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"officer in the Grenadier Guards, had known my wife since she was a"
3424,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"child. They seemed very pleased to see each other again, but there was"
3425,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,a certain sadness that I noticed in the young officer's manner. He had
3426,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"just been invalided home from South Africa, where he had been on active"
3427,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,service during the time with which my narrative deals. He was a
3428,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"handsome young man, tall and well built, and with kind and expressive"
3429,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,blue eyes. He was singularly reticent as to his exploits during the
3430,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"war, though I heard from a friend of his who was with him at Aix that"
3431,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,he had been mentioned in despatches and had been recommended for the
3432,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,D.S.O. He was a man to whom the merest chance acquaintance was certain
3433,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"to take a fancy. I am bound to say that I did so myself, and I hope"
3434,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,that in what I am calmly relating I shall not be considered to have
3435,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,intentionally failed to do him justice.
3436,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,
3437,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"It was the second week in August, and as the weather was very hot, my"
3438,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,wife and I had determined to leave Aix and go to Trouville for a little
3439,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,sea air and bathing. Three days before our departure I returned to the
3440,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,hotel to dress for dinner. I was just going through the corridor when I
3441,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,heard voices in our sitting-room. They were the voices of my wife and
3442,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,Captain Morland.
3443,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,
3444,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"I don't think that I am naturally a mean man, but I was mean enough to"
3445,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,listen on this occasion.
3446,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,
3447,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"""You mustn't blame me, Hubert,"" said my wife, ""we were all on the verge"
3448,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"of ruin, and I was bound to marry him."""

3454,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"I care for no one but you. But I shall always do my duty to my husband,"
3455,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"who is a kind and good man and lives entirely for me."""
3456,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,
3457,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"""If he died, you would marry me?"" asked Captain Morland."
3458,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,
3459,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"""Of course I would, and, as the children's storybooks say, 'live"
3460,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,happily ever afterwards.' But don't let us discuss deplorable
3461,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"futurities."""
3462,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,
3463,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"This was enough for me. I saw, now that it was too late, how wise my"
3464,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"sister Ruth had been, and how foolishly I had acted. There was nothing"
3465,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"to be done, however, to remedy matters, in view of the words spoken by"
3466,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"my wife, and words which breathed of truth. I went out quietly into the"
3467,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,garden of the hotel and came back a few minutes later. I asked Captain
3468,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"Morland to dine with us, and he accepted my invitation. I carefully"
3469,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"watched him and my wife during the evening, and clearly saw that the"
3470,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,case was hopeless from my point of view.
3471,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,
3472,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"On the morrow I made my will, and left everything to my wife with the"
3473,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,exception of fifty thousand pounds for my sister Ruth. I then wrote the
3474,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"little history of my mistake, and am posting it from the top of Mont"
3475,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"Revard to my friend Ross, and have asked him to act as he thinks best."
3476,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"It is hard to die, but, in my position, it is still harder to live."
3477,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,
3478,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"Having set my entire affections in one direction, and having been"
3479,LOVE WENT OUT WHEN MONEY WAS INVENTED.,"hopelessly unsuccessful, there is only one thing to be done, and that"
