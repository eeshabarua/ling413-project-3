114,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,"_And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take"
115,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,the water of life freely._--Revelation 22:17.
116,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,
117,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,
118,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,"I wandered down a mountain road,"
119,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,"Past flower and rock and lichen gray,"
120,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,Alone with nature and her God
121,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,Upon a flitting summer day.
122,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,
123,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,The forest skirted to the edge
124,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,"Of Capon river, Hampshire's gem,"
125,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,"Which, bathing many a primrose ledge,"
126,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,Oft sparkled like a diadem.
127,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,
128,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,"At length a silvery spring I spied,"
129,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,"Gurgling through moss and fern along,"
130,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,Waiting to bless with cooling tide
131,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,All who were gladdened by its song.
132,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,
133,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,"Oh, who would pass with thirsting lip"
134,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,"And burning brow, this limpid wave?"
135,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,Who would not pause with joy and sip?
136,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,Its crystal depths who would not crave?
137,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,
138,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,This query woke a voice within--
139,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,"Why slight the spring of God's great love,"
140,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,"That fount that cleanseth from all sin,"
141,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,Our purchase paid by Christ above?
142,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,
143,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,"Whoever will may drink! Oh, why,"
144,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,"Worn toilers in this earthly strife,"
145,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,"Reject a mansion in the sky,"
146,THE MOUNTAIN SPRING,Reject heaven's bliss and endless life?

155,GO WANDER,Nor let thy wand'ring cease;

157,GO WANDER,"From sin find sweet release,"
158,GO WANDER,
159,GO WANDER,"Through Christ, God's holy son,"
160,GO WANDER,Who left his throne in heaven
161,GO WANDER,And e'en death's anguish did not shun
162,GO WANDER,That we might be forgiven.

165,GO WANDER,"Exalt this mighty friend,"

176,LOVE,
177,LOVE,
178,LOVE,Christ might have called the angels down
179,LOVE,"To bear him safe above,"
180,LOVE,"To shield his brow from sorrow's crown,"
181,LOVE,"From death's cold blight, and bitter frown,"
182,LOVE,Had it not been for love.
183,LOVE,
184,LOVE,"Our glorious King, our Prince of Peace,"
185,LOVE,Has left his throne above
186,LOVE,"To give our souls from sin release,"
187,LOVE,"To make our pain and anguish cease,"
188,LOVE,And all because of love.
189,LOVE,
190,LOVE,"By faith in him, we all may see"
191,LOVE,"In realms of light above,"

208,THE LILIES,
209,THE LILIES,"The lilies of the field,"
210,THE LILIES,"Sweet teachers of the soul,"
211,THE LILIES,Which will their lessons yield
212,THE LILIES,"Long as the seasons roll,"
213,THE LILIES,
214,THE LILIES,"They neither toil nor spin,"
215,THE LILIES,"Exist without a care,"
216,THE LILIES,And yet no earthly king can win
217,THE LILIES,A garb so chaste and rare.
218,THE LILIES,
219,THE LILIES,"Frozen, they burst to life,"
220,THE LILIES,To nature's minstrelsy--

230,TELL PETER,
231,TELL PETER,
232,TELL PETER,"Peter, it was not outward cold"
233,TELL PETER,"But inward chill thy bosom froze,"
234,TELL PETER,Made thee deny with falsehood bold
235,TELL PETER,Thy Lord and Master to his foes.
236,TELL PETER,When we find cheer at Satan's fires
237,TELL PETER,"The world is there to work us harm,"
238,TELL PETER,To deaden all our pure desires
239,TELL PETER,With its deceitful lure and charm.
240,TELL PETER,
241,TELL PETER,"Peter, the voice of chanticleer"
242,TELL PETER,Fulfilled what Christ had prophesied;
243,TELL PETER,"And oh, that pitying look sincere"
244,TELL PETER,From him whom thou hadst just denied!
245,TELL PETER,Thy burst of penitential grief!
246,TELL PETER,Heaven those tears did surely send.
247,TELL PETER,Tears give the burdened heart relief;
248,TELL PETER,Dry anguish may its tendrils rend.
249,TELL PETER,
250,TELL PETER,"Sin soon will crucify our Lord,"
251,TELL PETER,"Thy sin, and all the world's beside."
252,TELL PETER,"He gave himself, the Living Word,"
253,TELL PETER,Our shelter from God's wrath to hide.
254,TELL PETER,Had all the seraphs pens to write
255,TELL PETER,"Such love upon the boundless sky,"
256,TELL PETER,Angelic powers could not indite
257,TELL PETER,Its greatness while the ages fly.
258,TELL PETER,
259,TELL PETER,The hour is hastening. God has willed
260,TELL PETER,That Christ should through his own decree
261,TELL PETER,Abolish death and have fulfilled
262,TELL PETER,Our blood-bought immortality.
263,TELL PETER,"And when the awful tomb he rent,"
264,TELL PETER,"When freed from every earthly thrall,"
265,TELL PETER,"""Tell Peter"" was the message sent;"
266,TELL PETER,"""Tell Peter""--'tis love's tender call."
267,TELL PETER,
268,TELL PETER,Peter was martyr to his faith;
269,TELL PETER,"His rock, God's son whom he denied;"
270,TELL PETER,This faith the key that unlocks death
271,TELL PETER,To realms where joy and peace abide.
272,TELL PETER,"""Tell Peter!"" Honey drops of love,"
273,TELL PETER,Awaking all the choirs of heaven!
274,TELL PETER,"""Tell Peter""--angels from above"

293,THE SLEET,"And what is the lesson we learn from the sleet,"
294,THE SLEET,"As toiling life's road with wearying feet,"

297,THE SLEET,
298,THE SLEET,'Tis this--that the hard breath of winter's chill blast
299,THE SLEET,Alone can this mantle of loveliness cast;

504,THE LIVING WATER,She left her home that morn
505,THE LIVING WATER,"In fair Samaria's land,"
506,THE LIVING WATER,"All heedless of her state forlorn,"
507,THE LIVING WATER,"Sin-bound, both heart and hand."
508,THE LIVING WATER,With prejudicial pride
509,THE LIVING WATER,She scorned the meek request
510,THE LIVING WATER,"Of One who sat the well beside,"
511,THE LIVING WATER,With heat and thirst opprest.
512,THE LIVING WATER,"""Thou art a Jew,"" she said,"
513,THE LIVING WATER,"""And asketh drink of me?"
514,THE LIVING WATER,Samaria's daughter was not bred

517,THE LIVING WATER,"E'en if its maker sued,"
518,THE LIVING WATER,"While he from love, with thirsting lip,"
519,THE LIVING WATER,Sought and her heart renewed.
520,THE LIVING WATER,"He made her ask for life,"
521,THE LIVING WATER,"Eternal life through him,"
522,THE LIVING WATER,"And ""living water"" was the type"
523,THE LIVING WATER,To her perception dim.
524,THE LIVING WATER,O yes! She fain would taste
525,THE LIVING WATER,"And never thirst again,"
526,THE LIVING WATER,And never cross the burning waste
527,THE LIVING WATER,In weariness and pain!
528,THE LIVING WATER,Her life he questioned now;
529,THE LIVING WATER,Revealed her history.
530,THE LIVING WATER,
531,THE LIVING WATER,She must have blushed. How could he know?
532,THE LIVING WATER,Here was a mystery!
533,THE LIVING WATER,"Abashed she now replied,"
534,THE LIVING WATER,"""Thou art a prophet, sir!"""

1438,MINISTERING WOMEN,"That spikenard, which 'twas wholly meet"
1439,MINISTERING WOMEN,"Mary should pour upon his head,"

1441,MINISTERING WOMEN,Succeeding ages as they've fled.
1442,MINISTERING WOMEN,
1443,MINISTERING WOMEN,And when a critic standing near
1444,MINISTERING WOMEN,"Censured her act, misunderstood,"
1445,MINISTERING WOMEN,Christ spoke so that the world might hear;
1446,MINISTERING WOMEN,"He said, ""She hath done what she could."""
1447,MINISTERING WOMEN,
1448,MINISTERING WOMEN,This her memorial while the sun
1449,MINISTERING WOMEN,"Traverses the blue dome of heaven,"
1450,MINISTERING WOMEN,Fulfilling while time's cycles run
1451,MINISTERING WOMEN,Christ's prophecy which then was given.

1453,MINISTERING WOMEN,"Unto the end these faithful few,"
1454,MINISTERING WOMEN,"Regardless of all pain and loss,"

1457,MINISTERING WOMEN,
1458,MINISTERING WOMEN,"Such love they could not understand,"
1459,MINISTERING WOMEN,Such love unto his latest breath;
1460,MINISTERING WOMEN,That love had our redemption planned
1461,MINISTERING WOMEN,Both in his life and in his death.
1462,MINISTERING WOMEN,
1463,MINISTERING WOMEN,"They haunt the tomb in which he lay,"
1464,MINISTERING WOMEN,"Grief-stricken, desolate, and lone;"
1465,MINISTERING WOMEN,But Magdalene at break of day
1466,MINISTERING WOMEN,Found that her precious charge was gone.
1467,MINISTERING WOMEN,
1468,MINISTERING WOMEN,"Two angels said, ""Why weepest thou?"""
1469,MINISTERING WOMEN,The angels knew ere they inquired.
1470,MINISTERING WOMEN,"They knew her heart could triumph now,"
1471,MINISTERING WOMEN,These sinless ones by love inspired.
1472,MINISTERING WOMEN,
1473,MINISTERING WOMEN,"She, weeping, told her loss and woe,"
1474,MINISTERING WOMEN,Then answered thus a questioner near:
1475,MINISTERING WOMEN,"""Sir, if thou dost his refuge know,"
1476,MINISTERING WOMEN,"Tell me. I seek him vainly here."""
1477,MINISTERING WOMEN,
1478,MINISTERING WOMEN,"""Mary!"" She listened to her name"
1479,MINISTERING WOMEN,"Uttered by Christ, her risen Lord."
1480,MINISTERING WOMEN,"""Master?"" her trembling lips exclaim,"
1481,MINISTERING WOMEN,"Then wondered, worshipped, and adored."
1482,MINISTERING WOMEN,
1483,MINISTERING WOMEN,"Her joy is ours! Oh, may we see"
1484,MINISTERING WOMEN,That joy more plainly every day!
1485,MINISTERING WOMEN,"Christ lives and loves eternally,--"
1486,MINISTERING WOMEN,Swift feet such tidings should convey.
1487,MINISTERING WOMEN,
1488,MINISTERING WOMEN,Eternal life and heavenly rest
1489,MINISTERING WOMEN,"He purchased by death's agony,"
1490,MINISTERING WOMEN,That whosoever will be blest
1491,MINISTERING WOMEN,With glorious immortality.
1492,MINISTERING WOMEN,
1493,MINISTERING WOMEN,May we our sisters of the past
1494,MINISTERING WOMEN,"In life and character revere,"
1495,MINISTERING WOMEN,"Like them be faithful to the last,"
1496,MINISTERING WOMEN,Like them be loving and sincere.
1497,MINISTERING WOMEN,
1498,MINISTERING WOMEN,First must the gospel plan of love
1499,MINISTERING WOMEN,"To every land and tribe be given,"
1500,MINISTERING WOMEN,Ere He'll return who from above
1501,MINISTERING WOMEN,Is God's best gift to earth from heaven.
