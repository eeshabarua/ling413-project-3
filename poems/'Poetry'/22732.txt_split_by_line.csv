107,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE
108,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,
109,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,"I NEVER saw that land before,"
110,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,And now can never see it again;
111,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,"Yet, as if by acquaintance hoar"
112,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,"Endeared, by gladness and by pain,"
113,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,Great was the affection that I bore
114,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,
115,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,"To the valley and the river small,"
116,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,"The cattle, the grass, the bare ash trees,"
117,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,"The chickens from the farmsteads, all"
118,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,"Elm-hidden, and the tributaries"
119,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,Descending at equal interval;
120,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,
121,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,The blackthorns down along the brook
122,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,With wounds yellow as crocuses
123,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,Where yesterday the labourer's hook
124,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,Had sliced them cleanly; and the breeze
125,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,That hinted all and nothing spoke.
126,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,
127,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,I neither expected anything
128,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,Nor yet remembered: but some goal
129,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,I touched then; and if I could sing
130,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,What would not even whisper my soul
131,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,"As I went on my journeying,"
132,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,
133,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,"I should use, as the trees and birds did,"
134,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,A language not to be betrayed;
135,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,And what was hid should still be hid
136,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,Excepting from those like me made
137,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,Who answer when such whispers bid.
138,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,
139,I NEVER SAW THAT LAND BEFORE,
140,THE DARK FOREST,THE DARK FOREST
141,THE DARK FOREST,
142,THE DARK FOREST,"DARK is the forest and deep, and overhead"
143,THE DARK FOREST,Hang stars like seeds of light
144,THE DARK FOREST,"In vain, though not since they were sown was bred"
145,THE DARK FOREST,Anything more bright.
146,THE DARK FOREST,
147,THE DARK FOREST,And evermore mighty multitudes ride
148,THE DARK FOREST,"About, nor enter in;"
149,THE DARK FOREST,Of the other multitudes that dwell inside
150,THE DARK FOREST,Never yet was one seen.
151,THE DARK FOREST,
152,THE DARK FOREST,"The forest foxglove is purple, the marguerite"
153,THE DARK FOREST,"Outside is gold and white,"
154,THE DARK FOREST,Nor can those that pluck either blossom greet
155,THE DARK FOREST,"The others, day or night."

158,CELANDINE,CELANDINE
159,CELANDINE,
160,CELANDINE,"THINKING of her had saddened me at first,"
161,CELANDINE,Until I saw the sun on the celandines lie
162,CELANDINE,"Redoubled, and she stood up like a flame,"
163,CELANDINE,"A living thing, not what before I nursed,"
164,CELANDINE,"The shadow I was growing to love almost,"
165,CELANDINE,"The phantom, not the creature with bright eye"
166,CELANDINE,"That I had thought never to see, once lost."
167,CELANDINE,
168,CELANDINE,She found the celandines of February
169,CELANDINE,Always before us all. Her nature and name
170,CELANDINE,"Were like those flowers, and now immediately"
171,CELANDINE,"For a short swift eternity back she came,"
172,CELANDINE,"Beautiful, happy, simply as when she wore"
173,CELANDINE,Her brightest bloom among the winter hues
174,CELANDINE,"Of all the world; and I was happy too,"
175,CELANDINE,Seeing the blossoms and the maiden who
176,CELANDINE,"Had seen them with me Februarys before,"
177,CELANDINE,Bending to them as in and out she trod
178,CELANDINE,"And laughed, with locks sweeping the mossy sod."
179,CELANDINE,
180,CELANDINE,"But this was a dream: the flowers were not true,"
181,CELANDINE,Until I stooped to pluck from the grass there
182,CELANDINE,One of five petals and I smelt the juice
183,CELANDINE,"Which made me sigh, remembering she was no more,"
184,CELANDINE,Gone like a never perfectly recalled air.

187,THE ASH GROVE,THE ASH GROVE
188,THE ASH GROVE,
189,THE ASH GROVE,"HALF of the grove stood dead, and those that yet"
190,THE ASH GROVE,lived made
191,THE ASH GROVE,Little more than the dead ones made of shade.
192,THE ASH GROVE,"If they led to a house, long before they had seen"
193,THE ASH GROVE,its fall:
194,THE ASH GROVE,But they welcomed me; I was glad without cause
195,THE ASH GROVE,and delayed.
196,THE ASH GROVE,
197,THE ASH GROVE,Scarce a hundred paces under the trees was the
198,THE ASH GROVE,Interval--
199,THE ASH GROVE,Paces each sweeter than sweetest miles--but
200,THE ASH GROVE,"nothing at all,"
201,THE ASH GROVE,Not even the spirits of memory and fear with
202,THE ASH GROVE,"restless wing,"
203,THE ASH GROVE,Could climb down in to molest me over the wall
204,THE ASH GROVE,
205,THE ASH GROVE,That I passed through at either end without
206,THE ASH GROVE,noticing.
207,THE ASH GROVE,And now an ash grove far from those hills can bring
208,THE ASH GROVE,The same tranquillity in which I wander a ghost
209,THE ASH GROVE,"With a ghostly gladness, as if I heard a girl sing"
210,THE ASH GROVE,
211,THE ASH GROVE,"The song of the Ash Grove soft as love uncrossed,"
212,THE ASH GROVE,"And then in a crowd or in distance it were lost,"
213,THE ASH GROVE,But the moment unveiled something unwilling
214,THE ASH GROVE,to die
215,THE ASH GROVE,"And I had what most I desired, without search or"
216,THE ASH GROVE,desert or cost.
217,THE ASH GROVE,
218,THE ASH GROVE,
219,OLD MAN,OLD MAN
220,OLD MAN,
221,OLD MAN,"OLD Man, or Lad's-love,--in the name there's"
222,OLD MAN,nothing
223,OLD MAN,"To one that knows not Lad's-love, or Old Man,"
224,OLD MAN,"The hoar-green feathery herb, almost a tree,"
225,OLD MAN,Growing with rosemary and lavender.
226,OLD MAN,"Even to one that knows it well, the names"
227,OLD MAN,"Half decorate, half perplex, the thing it is:"
228,OLD MAN,"At least, what that is clings not to the names"
229,OLD MAN,In spite of time. And yet I like the names.
230,OLD MAN,
231,OLD MAN,"The herb itself I like not, but for certain"
232,OLD MAN,"I love it, as some day the child will love it"
233,OLD MAN,Who plucks a feather from the door-side bush
234,OLD MAN,Whenever she goes in or out of the house.
235,OLD MAN,"Often she waits there, snipping the tips and"
236,OLD MAN,shrivelling
237,OLD MAN,"The shreds at last on to the path, perhaps"
238,OLD MAN,"Thinking, perhaps of nothing, till she sniffs"
239,OLD MAN,Her fingers and runs off. The bush is still
240,OLD MAN,"But half as tall as she, though it is as old;"
241,OLD MAN,So well she clips it. Not a word she says;
242,OLD MAN,And I can only wonder how much hereafter
243,OLD MAN,"She will remember, with that bitter scent,"
244,OLD MAN,"Of garden rows, and ancient damson-trees"
245,OLD MAN,"Topping a hedge, a bent path to a door,"
246,OLD MAN,"A low thick bush beside the door, and me"
247,OLD MAN,Forbidding her to pick.
248,OLD MAN,
249,OLD MAN,"As for myself,"
250,OLD MAN,Where first I met the bitter scent is lost.
251,OLD MAN,"I, too, often shrivel the grey shreds,"
252,OLD MAN,Sniff them and think and sniff again and try
253,OLD MAN,"Once more to think what it is I am remembering,"
254,OLD MAN,"Always in vain. I cannot like the scent,"
255,OLD MAN,"Yet I would rather give up others more sweet,"
256,OLD MAN,"With no meaning, than this bitter one."
257,OLD MAN,
258,OLD MAN,I have mislaid the key. I sniff the spray
259,OLD MAN,And think of nothing; I see and I hear nothing;
260,OLD MAN,"Yet seem, too, to be listening, lying in wait"
261,OLD MAN,"For what I should, yet never can, remember:"
262,OLD MAN,"No garden appears, no path, no hoar-green bush"
263,OLD MAN,"Of Lad's-love, or Old Man, no child beside,"
264,OLD MAN,"Neither father nor mother, nor any playmate;"
265,OLD MAN,"Only an avenue, dark, nameless, without end."
266,OLD MAN,
267,OLD MAN,
268,THE THRUSH,THE THRUSH
269,THE THRUSH,
270,THE THRUSH,"WHEN Winter's ahead,"
271,THE THRUSH,What can you read in November
272,THE THRUSH,That you read in April
273,THE THRUSH,When Winter's dead?
274,THE THRUSH,
275,THE THRUSH,"I hear the thrush, and I see"
276,THE THRUSH,Him alone at the end of the lane
277,THE THRUSH,"Near the bare poplar's tip,"
278,THE THRUSH,Singing continuously.
279,THE THRUSH,
280,THE THRUSH,Is it more that you know
281,THE THRUSH,"Than that, even as in April,"
282,THE THRUSH,"So in November,"
283,THE THRUSH,Winter is gone that must go?
284,THE THRUSH,
285,THE THRUSH,Or is all your lore
286,THE THRUSH,"Not to call November November,"
287,THE THRUSH,"And April April,"
288,THE THRUSH,And Winter Winter--no more?
289,THE THRUSH,
290,THE THRUSH,"But I know the months all,"
291,THE THRUSH,"And their sweet names, April,"
292,THE THRUSH,"May and June and October,"
293,THE THRUSH,As you call and call
294,THE THRUSH,
295,THE THRUSH,I must remember
296,THE THRUSH,What died into April
297,THE THRUSH,And consider what will be born
298,THE THRUSH,Of a fair November;
299,THE THRUSH,
300,THE THRUSH,And April I love for what
301,THE THRUSH,"It was born of, and November"
302,THE THRUSH,"For what it will die in,"
303,THE THRUSH,"What they are and what they are not,"
304,THE THRUSH,
305,THE THRUSH,"While you love what is kind,"
306,THE THRUSH,What you can sing in
307,THE THRUSH,And love and forget in
308,THE THRUSH,All that's ahead and behind.
309,THE THRUSH,
310,THE THRUSH,
311,I BUILT MYSELF A HOUSE OF GLASS.,I BUILT MYSELF A HOUSE OF GLASS.
312,I BUILT MYSELF A HOUSE OF GLASS.,
313,I BUILT MYSELF A HOUSE OF GLASS.,I BUILT myself a house of glass:
314,I BUILT MYSELF A HOUSE OF GLASS.,It took me years to make it:
315,I BUILT MYSELF A HOUSE OF GLASS.,"And I was proud. But now, alas,"
316,I BUILT MYSELF A HOUSE OF GLASS.,Would God someone would break it.
317,I BUILT MYSELF A HOUSE OF GLASS.,But it looks too magnificent.
318,I BUILT MYSELF A HOUSE OF GLASS.,No neighbour casts a stone
319,I BUILT MYSELF A HOUSE OF GLASS.,"From where he dwells, in tenement"
320,I BUILT MYSELF A HOUSE OF GLASS.,"Or palace of glass, alone."
321,I BUILT MYSELF A HOUSE OF GLASS.,

323,FEBRUARY AFTERNOON,FEBRUARY AFTERNOON
324,FEBRUARY AFTERNOON,
325,FEBRUARY AFTERNOON,"MEN heard this roar of parleying starlings, saw,"
326,FEBRUARY AFTERNOON,"A thousand years ago even as now,"
327,FEBRUARY AFTERNOON,Black rooks with white gulls following the plough
328,FEBRUARY AFTERNOON,So that the first are last until a caw
329,FEBRUARY AFTERNOON,"Commands that last are first again,--a law"
330,FEBRUARY AFTERNOON,"Which was of old when one, like me, dreamed"
331,FEBRUARY AFTERNOON,how
332,FEBRUARY AFTERNOON,A thousand years might dust lie on his brow
333,FEBRUARY AFTERNOON,Yet thus would birds do between hedge and shaw.
334,FEBRUARY AFTERNOON,
335,FEBRUARY AFTERNOON,"Time swims before me, making as a day"
336,FEBRUARY AFTERNOON,"A thousand years, while the broad ploughland"
337,FEBRUARY AFTERNOON,oak
338,FEBRUARY AFTERNOON,Roars mill-like and men strike and bear the
339,FEBRUARY AFTERNOON,stroke
340,FEBRUARY AFTERNOON,"Of war as ever, audacious or resigned,"
341,FEBRUARY AFTERNOON,And God still sits aloft in the array
342,FEBRUARY AFTERNOON,"That we have wrought him, stone-deaf and"
343,FEBRUARY AFTERNOON,stone-blind.

348,DIGGING,"WHAT matter makes my spade for tears or mirth,"
349,DIGGING,Letting down two clay pipes into the earth?
350,DIGGING,"The one I smoked, the other a soldier"
351,DIGGING,"Of Blenheim, Ramillies, and Malplaquet"
352,DIGGING,Perhaps. The dead man's immortality
353,DIGGING,"Lies represented lightly with my own,"
354,DIGGING,A yard or two nearer the living air
355,DIGGING,"Than bones of ancients who, amazed to see"
356,DIGGING,"Almighty God erect the mastodon,"
357,DIGGING,"Once laughed, or wept, in this same light of day."

360,TWO HOUSES,TWO HOUSES
361,TWO HOUSES,
362,TWO HOUSES,BETWEEN a sunny bank and the sun
363,TWO HOUSES,The farmhouse smiles
364,TWO HOUSES,On the riverside plat:
365,TWO HOUSES,No other one
366,TWO HOUSES,So pleasant to look at
367,TWO HOUSES,"And remember, for many miles,"
368,TWO HOUSES,So velvet-hushed and cool under the warm tiles.
369,TWO HOUSES,
370,TWO HOUSES,"Not far from the road it lies, yet caught"
371,TWO HOUSES,Far out of reach
372,TWO HOUSES,Of the road's dust
373,TWO HOUSES,And the dusty thought
374,TWO HOUSES,"Of passers-by, though each"
375,TWO HOUSES,"Stops, and turns, and must"
376,TWO HOUSES,Look down at it like a wasp at the muslined peach.
377,TWO HOUSES,
378,TWO HOUSES,But another house stood there long before:
379,TWO HOUSES,And as if above graves
380,TWO HOUSES,Still the turf heaves
381,TWO HOUSES,Above its stones:
382,TWO HOUSES,"Dark hangs the sycamore,"
383,TWO HOUSES,Shadowing kennel and bones
384,TWO HOUSES,And the black dog that shakes his chain and moans.
385,TWO HOUSES,
386,TWO HOUSES,"And when he barks, over the river"
387,TWO HOUSES,"Flashing fast,"
388,TWO HOUSES,"Dark echoes reply,"
389,TWO HOUSES,And the hollow past
390,TWO HOUSES,Half yields the dead that never
391,TWO HOUSES,More than half hidden lie:
392,TWO HOUSES,And out they creep and back again for ever.
393,TWO HOUSES,
394,TWO HOUSES,
395,THE MILL-WATER,THE MILL-WATER
396,THE MILL-WATER,
397,THE MILL-WATER,ONLY the sound remains
398,THE MILL-WATER,Of the old mill;
399,THE MILL-WATER,Gone is the wheel;
400,THE MILL-WATER,On the prone roof and walls the nettle reigns.
401,THE MILL-WATER,
402,THE MILL-WATER,Water that toils no more
403,THE MILL-WATER,Dangles white locks
404,THE MILL-WATER,"And, falling, mocks"
405,THE MILL-WATER,The music of the mill-wheel's busy roar.
406,THE MILL-WATER,
407,THE MILL-WATER,"Pretty to see, by day"
408,THE MILL-WATER,Its sound is naught
409,THE MILL-WATER,Compared with thought
410,THE MILL-WATER,And talk and noise of labour and of play.
411,THE MILL-WATER,
412,THE MILL-WATER,Night makes the difference.
413,THE MILL-WATER,"In calm moonlight,"
414,THE MILL-WATER,"Gloom infinite,"
415,THE MILL-WATER,The sound comes surging in upon the sense:
416,THE MILL-WATER,
417,THE MILL-WATER,"Solitude, company,--"
418,THE MILL-WATER,"When it is night,--"
419,THE MILL-WATER,Grief or delight
420,THE MILL-WATER,By it must haunted or concluded be.
421,THE MILL-WATER,
422,THE MILL-WATER,Often the silentness
423,THE MILL-WATER,Has but this one
424,THE MILL-WATER,Companion;
425,THE MILL-WATER,Wherever one creeps in the other is:
426,THE MILL-WATER,
427,THE MILL-WATER,Sometimes a thought is drowned
428,THE MILL-WATER,"By it, sometimes"
429,THE MILL-WATER,Out of it climbs;
430,THE MILL-WATER,"All thoughts begin or end upon this sound,"
431,THE MILL-WATER,
432,THE MILL-WATER,Only the idle foam
433,THE MILL-WATER,Of water falling
434,THE MILL-WATER,"Changelessly calling,"
435,THE MILL-WATER,Where once men had a work-place and a home.
436,THE MILL-WATER,
437,THE MILL-WATER,
438,A DREAM,A DREAM
439,A DREAM,
440,A DREAM,OVER known fields with an old friend in dream
441,A DREAM,"I walked, but came sudden to a strange stream."
442,A DREAM,Its dark waters were bursting out most bright
443,A DREAM,From a great mountain's heart into the light.
444,A DREAM,"They ran a short course under the sun, then back"
445,A DREAM,"Into a pit they plunged, once more as black"
446,A DREAM,As at their birth; and I stood thinking there
447,A DREAM,"How white, had the day shone on them, they were,"
448,A DREAM,Heaving and coiling. So by the roar and hiss
449,A DREAM,And by the mighty motion of the abyss
450,A DREAM,"I was bemused, that I forgot my friend"
451,A DREAM,"And neither saw nor sought him till the end,"
452,A DREAM,When I awoke from waters unto men
453,A DREAM,"Saying: ""I shall be here some day again."""
454,A DREAM,
455,A DREAM,
456,SEDGE-WARBLERS,SEDGE-WARBLERS
457,SEDGE-WARBLERS,
458,SEDGE-WARBLERS,THIS beauty made me dream there was a time
459,SEDGE-WARBLERS,"Long past and irrecoverable, a clime"
460,SEDGE-WARBLERS,Where any brook so radiant racing clear
461,SEDGE-WARBLERS,Through buttercup and kingcup bright as brass
462,SEDGE-WARBLERS,"But gentle, nourishing the meadow grass"
463,SEDGE-WARBLERS,"That leans and scurries in the wind, would bear"
464,SEDGE-WARBLERS,"Another beauty, divine and feminine,"
465,SEDGE-WARBLERS,"Child to the sun, a nymph whose soul unstained"
466,SEDGE-WARBLERS,"Could love all day, and never hate or tire,"
467,SEDGE-WARBLERS,A lover of mortal or immortal kin.
468,SEDGE-WARBLERS,
469,SEDGE-WARBLERS,"And yet, rid of this dream, ere I had drained"
470,SEDGE-WARBLERS,"Its poison, quieted was my desire"
471,SEDGE-WARBLERS,"So that I only looked into the water,"
472,SEDGE-WARBLERS,"Clearer than any goddess or man's daughter,"
473,SEDGE-WARBLERS,And hearkened while it combed the dark green hair
474,SEDGE-WARBLERS,And shook the millions of the blossoms white
475,SEDGE-WARBLERS,"Of water-crowfoot, and curdled to one sheet"
476,SEDGE-WARBLERS,The flowers fallen from the chestnuts in the park
477,SEDGE-WARBLERS,"Far off. And sedge-warblers, clinging so light"
478,SEDGE-WARBLERS,"To willow twigs, sang longer than the lark,"
479,SEDGE-WARBLERS,"Quick, shrill, or grating, a song to match the heat"
480,SEDGE-WARBLERS,"Of the strong sun, nor less the water's cool,"
481,SEDGE-WARBLERS,"Gushing through narrows, swirling in the pool."
482,SEDGE-WARBLERS,"Their song that lacks all words, all melody,"
483,SEDGE-WARBLERS,"All sweetness almost, was dearer then to me"
484,SEDGE-WARBLERS,Than sweetest voice that sings in tune sweet words.
485,SEDGE-WARBLERS,This was the best of May--the small brown birds
486,SEDGE-WARBLERS,Wisely reiterating endlessly
487,SEDGE-WARBLERS,"What no man learnt yet, in or out of school."
488,SEDGE-WARBLERS,

504,UNDER THE WOODS,And he had not
505,UNDER THE WOODS,Much lead or gold.
506,UNDER THE WOODS,
507,UNDER THE WOODS,Most silent beech and yew:
508,UNDER THE WOODS,As he went round about
509,UNDER THE WOODS,The woods to view
510,UNDER THE WOODS,Seldom he shot.
511,UNDER THE WOODS,
512,UNDER THE WOODS,But now that he is gone
513,UNDER THE WOODS,"Out of most memories,"
514,UNDER THE WOODS,"Still lingers on,"
515,UNDER THE WOODS,"A stoat of his,"
516,UNDER THE WOODS,

524,WHAT WILL THEY DO?,
525,WHAT WILL THEY DO?,What will they do when I am gone? It is plain
526,WHAT WILL THEY DO?,That they will do without me as the rain
527,WHAT WILL THEY DO?,Can do without the flowers and the grass
528,WHAT WILL THEY DO?,That profit by it and must perish without.
529,WHAT WILL THEY DO?,I have but seen them in the loud street pass;
530,WHAT WILL THEY DO?,And I was naught to them. I turned about
531,WHAT WILL THEY DO?,To see them disappearing carelessly.
532,WHAT WILL THEY DO?,But what if I in them as they in me
533,WHAT WILL THEY DO?,Nourished what has great value and no price?
534,WHAT WILL THEY DO?,Almost I thought that rain thirsts for a draught
535,WHAT WILL THEY DO?,"Which only in the blossom's chalice lies,"
536,WHAT WILL THEY DO?,Until that one turned back and lightly laughed.

708,THE NEW HOUSE,
709,THE NEW HOUSE,"Now first, as I shut the door,"
710,THE NEW HOUSE,I was alone
711,THE NEW HOUSE,In the new house; and the wind
712,THE NEW HOUSE,Began to moan.
713,THE NEW HOUSE,
714,THE NEW HOUSE,"Old at once was the house,"
715,THE NEW HOUSE,And I was old;
716,THE NEW HOUSE,My ears were teased with the dread
717,THE NEW HOUSE,"Of what was foretold,"
718,THE NEW HOUSE,
719,THE NEW HOUSE,"Nights of storm, days of mist, without end;"
720,THE NEW HOUSE,Sad days when the sun
721,THE NEW HOUSE,Shone in vain: old griefs and griefs
722,THE NEW HOUSE,Not yet begun.
723,THE NEW HOUSE,
724,THE NEW HOUSE,All was foretold me; naught
725,THE NEW HOUSE,Could I foresee;

731,MARCH,
732,MARCH,"Now I know that Spring will come again,"
733,MARCH,Perhaps to-morrow: however late I've patience
734,MARCH,After this night following on such a day.
735,MARCH,
736,MARCH,While still my temples ached from the cold burning
737,MARCH,"Of hail and wind, and still the primroses"
738,MARCH,"Torn by the hail were covered up in it,"
739,MARCH,The sun filled earth and heaven with a great light
740,MARCH,"And a tenderness, almost warmth, where the hail"
741,MARCH,"dripped,"
742,MARCH,As if the mighty sun wept tears of joy.
743,MARCH,But 'twas too late for warmth. The sunset piled
744,MARCH,Mountains on mountains of snow and ice in the
745,MARCH,west:
746,MARCH,"Somewhere among their folds the wind was lost,"
747,MARCH,"And yet 'twas cold, and though I knew that"
748,MARCH,Spring
749,MARCH,"Would come again, I knew it had not come,"
750,MARCH,That it was lost too in those mountains chill.
751,MARCH,
752,MARCH,"What did the thrushes know? Rain, snow, sleet,"
753,MARCH,"hail,"
754,MARCH,Had kept them quiet as the primroses.
755,MARCH,They had but an hour to sing. On boughs they
756,MARCH,"sang,"
757,MARCH,"On gates, on ground; they sang while they"
758,MARCH,changed perches
759,MARCH,"And while they fought, if they remembered to"
760,MARCH,fight:
761,MARCH,So earnest were they to pack into that hour
762,MARCH,Their unwilling hoard of song before the moon
763,MARCH,Grew brighter than the clouds. Then 'twas
764,MARCH,no time
765,MARCH,For singing merely. So they could keep off silence
766,MARCH,"And night, they cared not what they sang or"
767,MARCH,screamed;
768,MARCH,Whether 'twas hoarse or sweet or fierce or soft;
769,MARCH,And to me all was sweet: they could do no wrong.
770,MARCH,"Something they knew--I also, while they sang"
771,MARCH,And after. Not till night had half its stars
772,MARCH,"And never a cloud, was I aware of silence"
773,MARCH,"Stained with all that hour's songs, a silence"
774,MARCH,"Saying that Spring returns, perhaps to-morrow."

780,THE CUCKOO,When last I heard it I cannot recall; but I know
781,THE CUCKOO,Too well the year when first I failed to hear it--
782,THE CUCKOO,It was drowned by my man groaning out to his
783,THE CUCKOO,"sheep ""Ho! Ho!"""
784,THE CUCKOO,
785,THE CUCKOO,Ten times with an angry voice he shouted
786,THE CUCKOO,"""Ho! Ho!"" but not in anger, for that was his"
787,THE CUCKOO,way.
788,THE CUCKOO,"He died that Summer, and that is how I remember"
789,THE CUCKOO,"The cuckoo calling, the children listening, and me"
790,THE CUCKOO,"saying, ""Nay."""
791,THE CUCKOO,
792,THE CUCKOO,"And now, as you said, ""There it is,"" I was hearing"
793,THE CUCKOO,"Not the cuckoo at all, but my man's ""Ho! Ho!"""
794,THE CUCKOO,instead.
795,THE CUCKOO,And I think that even if I could lose my deafness
796,THE CUCKOO,The cuckoo's note would be drowned by the voice
797,THE CUCKOO,of my dead.

807,OVER THE HILLS,The harvest evening that seemed endless then
808,OVER THE HILLS,"And after, and the inn where all were kind,"
809,OVER THE HILLS,All were strangers. I did not know my loss
810,OVER THE HILLS,Till one day twelve months later suddenly
811,OVER THE HILLS,"I leaned upon my spade and saw it all,"
812,OVER THE HILLS,Though far beyond the sky-line. It became
813,OVER THE HILLS,Almost a habit through the year for me
814,OVER THE HILLS,To lean and see it and think to do the same
815,OVER THE HILLS,Again for two days and a night. Recall
816,OVER THE HILLS,Was vain: no more could the restless brook
817,OVER THE HILLS,Ever turn back and climb the waterfall
818,OVER THE HILLS,"To the lake that rests and stirs not in its nook,"
819,OVER THE HILLS,As in the hollow of the collar-bone

830,HOME,One memory.

832,HOME,They welcomed me. I had come back
833,HOME,That eve somehow from somewhere far:
834,HOME,"The April mist, the chill, the calm,"
835,HOME,Meant the same thing familiar
836,HOME,"And pleasant to us, and strange too,"
837,HOME,Yet with no bar.
838,HOME,
839,HOME,The thrush on the oaktop in the lane
840,HOME,"Sang his last song, or last but one;"
841,HOME,"And as he ended, on the elm"
842,HOME,Another had but just begun
843,HOME,His last; they knew no more than I
844,HOME,The day was done.
845,HOME,
846,HOME,Then past his dark white cottage front
847,HOME,"A labourer went along, his tread"
848,HOME,"Slow, half with weariness, half with ease;"
849,HOME,"And, through the silence, from his shed"
850,HOME,The sound of sawing rounded all

881,WIND AND MIST,To play upon this board it could not be
882,WIND AND MIST,More dear than April has made it with a smile.
883,WIND AND MIST,The fields beyond that league close in together
884,WIND AND MIST,"And merge, even as our days into the past,"
885,WIND AND MIST,Into one wood that has a shining pane

894,WIND AND MIST,"""That house, though modern, could not be better"

913,WIND AND MIST,"""No offence. Doubtless the house was not to"

920,WIND AND MIST,"(You see), and if clouds went, the visible earth"
921,WIND AND MIST,Lay too far off beneath and like a cloud.
922,WIND AND MIST,I did not know it was the earth I loved

928,WIND AND MIST,The flint was the one crop that never failed.
929,WIND AND MIST,"The clay first broke my heart, and then my back;"
930,WIND AND MIST,And the back heals not. There were other things
931,WIND AND MIST,"Real, too. In that room at the gable a child"

935,WIND AND MIST,"""I hope they were both spared."" ""They were."
936,WIND AND MIST,Oh yes.
937,WIND AND MIST,But flint and clay and childbirth were too real
938,WIND AND MIST,For this cloud-castle. I had forgot the wind.
939,WIND AND MIST,Pray do not let me get on to the wind.
940,WIND AND MIST,You would not understand about the wind.
941,WIND AND MIST,"It is my subject, and compared with me"
942,WIND AND MIST,Those who have always lived on the firm ground
943,WIND AND MIST,Are quite unreal in this matter of the wind.
944,WIND AND MIST,There were whole days and nights when the wind
945,WIND AND MIST,and I
946,WIND AND MIST,"Between us shared the world, and the wind ruled"
947,WIND AND MIST,And I obeyed it and forgot the mist.
948,WIND AND MIST,My past and the past of the world were in the

950,WIND AND MIST,Now you may say that though you understand
951,WIND AND MIST,"And feel for me, and so on, you yourself"
952,WIND AND MIST,Would find it different. You are all like that

965,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,"THREE lovely notes he whistled, too soft to be"
966,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,heard
967,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,If others sang; but others never sang
968,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,In the great beech-wood all that May and June.
969,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,No one saw him: I alone could hear him
970,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,Though many listened. Was it but four years
971,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,Ago? or five? He never came again.
972,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,
973,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,"Oftenest when I heard him I was alone,"
974,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,Nor could I ever make another hear.
975,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,"La-la-la! he called, seeming far-off--"
976,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,"As if a cock crowed past the edge of the world,"
977,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,As if the bird or I were in a dream.
978,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,Yet that he travelled through the trees and some-
979,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,times
980,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,"Neared me, was plain, though somehow distant"
981,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,still
982,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,He sounded. All the proof is--I told men
983,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,What I had heard.
984,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,
985,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,"I never knew a voice,"
986,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,"Man, beast, or bird, better than this. I told"
987,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,The naturalists; but neither had they heard
988,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,"Anything like the notes that did so haunt me,"
989,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,I had them clear by heart and have them still.
990,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,"Four years, or five, have made no difference."
991,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,Then
992,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,As now that La-la-la! was bodiless sweet:
993,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,"Sad more than joyful it was, if I must say"
994,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,"That it was one or other, but if sad"
995,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,"'Twas sad only with joy too, too far off"
996,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,For me to taste it. But I cannot tell
997,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,If truly never anything but fair
998,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,"The days were when he sang, as now they seem."
999,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,"This surely I know, that I who listened then,"
1000,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,"Happy sometimes, sometimes suffering"
1001,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,"A heavy body and a heavy heart,"
1002,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,"Now straightway, if I think of it, become"
1003,THE UNKNOWN BIRD,Light as that bird wandering beyond my shore.

1025,THE LOFTY SKY,"Leagues deep, leagues wide, where"

1027,THE LOFTY SKY,In weeds and mud and gives
1028,THE LOFTY SKY,What's above him no thought.
1029,THE LOFTY SKY,I might be a tench for aught
1030,THE LOFTY SKY,That I can do to-day
1031,THE LOFTY SKY,Down on the wealden clay.
1032,THE LOFTY SKY,Even the tench has days
1033,THE LOFTY SKY,When he floats up and plays
1034,THE LOFTY SKY,Among the lily leaves
1035,THE LOFTY SKY,"And sees the sky, or grieves"
1036,THE LOFTY SKY,Not if he nothing sees:
1037,THE LOFTY SKY,"While I, I know that trees"
1038,THE LOFTY SKY,Under that lofty sky
1039,THE LOFTY SKY,"Are weeds, fields mud, and I"

1050,AFTER RAIN,The road under the trees has a border new
1051,AFTER RAIN,Of purple hue
1052,AFTER RAIN,Inside the border of bright thin grass:
1053,AFTER RAIN,For all that has
1054,AFTER RAIN,Been left by November of leaves is torn
1055,AFTER RAIN,From hazel and thorn
1056,AFTER RAIN,And the greater trees. Throughout the copse
1057,AFTER RAIN,No dead leaf drops
1058,AFTER RAIN,"On grey grass, green moss, burnt-orange fern,"
1059,AFTER RAIN,At the wind's return:
1060,AFTER RAIN,The leaflets out of the ash-tree shed
1061,AFTER RAIN,Are thinly spread
1062,AFTER RAIN,"In the road, like little black fish, inlaid,"
1063,AFTER RAIN,As if they played.
1064,AFTER RAIN,What hangs from the myriad branches down there
1065,AFTER RAIN,So hard and bare
1066,AFTER RAIN,Is twelve yellow apples lovely to see
1067,AFTER RAIN,On one crab-tree.
1068,AFTER RAIN,And on each twig of every tree in the dell
1069,AFTER RAIN,Uncountable

2063,THE BROOK,Mellow the blackbird sang and sharp the thrush
2064,THE BROOK,"Not far off in the oak and hazel brush,"
2065,THE BROOK,Unseen. There was a scent like honeycomb
2066,THE BROOK,From mugwort dull. And down upon the dome
2067,THE BROOK,Of the stone the cart-horse kicks against so oft
2068,THE BROOK,A butterfly alighted. From aloft

2096,THE OTHER,"And the sweet mint, because I had come"
2097,THE OTHER,"To an end of forest, and because"
2098,THE OTHER,"Here was both road and inn, the sum"
2099,THE OTHER,Of what's not forest. But 'twas here
2100,THE OTHER,They asked me if I did not pass
2101,THE OTHER,"Yesterday this way? ""Not you? Queer."""
2102,THE OTHER,"""Who then? and slept here?"" I felt fear."
2103,THE OTHER,
2104,THE OTHER,"I learnt his road and, ere they were"
2105,THE OTHER,"Sure I was I, left the dark wood"
2106,THE OTHER,"Behind, kestrel and woodpecker,"
2107,THE OTHER,"The inn in the sun, the happy mood"
2108,THE OTHER,When first I tasted sunlight there.
2109,THE OTHER,"I travelled fast, in hopes I should"
2110,THE OTHER,Outrun that other. What to do
2111,THE OTHER,"When caught, I planned not. I pursued"
2112,THE OTHER,"To prove the likeness, and, if true,"
2113,THE OTHER,To watch until myself I knew.
2114,THE OTHER,
2115,THE OTHER,I tried the inns that evening
2116,THE OTHER,"Of a long gabled high-street grey,"
2117,THE OTHER,"Of courts and outskirts, travelling"
2118,THE OTHER,"An eager but a weary way,"
2119,THE OTHER,In vain. He was not there. Nothing
2120,THE OTHER,Told me that ever till that day
2121,THE OTHER,"Had one like me entered those doors,"
2122,THE OTHER,"Save once. That time I dared: ""You may"
2123,THE OTHER,"Recall""--but never-foamless shores"
2124,THE OTHER,Make better friends than those dull boors.
2125,THE OTHER,
2126,THE OTHER,Many and many a day like this
2127,THE OTHER,Aimed at the unseen moving goal
2128,THE OTHER,And nothing found but remedies
2129,THE OTHER,For all desire. These made not whole;
2130,THE OTHER,"They sowed a new desire, to kiss"
2131,THE OTHER,"Desire's self beyond control,"
2132,THE OTHER,Desire of desire. And yet
2133,THE OTHER,Life stayed on within my soul.
2134,THE OTHER,One night in sheltering from the wet
2135,THE OTHER,I quite forgot I could forget.
2136,THE OTHER,
2137,THE OTHER,"A customer, then the landlady"
2138,THE OTHER,Stared at me. With a kind of smile
2139,THE OTHER,They hesitated awkwardly:
2140,THE OTHER,Their silence gave me time for guile.
2141,THE OTHER,"Had anyone called there like me,"
2142,THE OTHER,I asked. It was quite plain the wile
2143,THE OTHER,Succeeded. For they poured out all.
2144,THE OTHER,And that was naught. Less than a mile
2145,THE OTHER,"Beyond the inn, I could recall"
2146,THE OTHER,He was like me in general.
2147,THE OTHER,
2148,THE OTHER,"He had pleased them, but I less."
2149,THE OTHER,I was more eager than before
2150,THE OTHER,"To find him out and to confess,"
2151,THE OTHER,To bore him and to let him bore.
2152,THE OTHER,I could not wait: children might guess
2153,THE OTHER,"I had a purpose, something more"
2154,THE OTHER,That made an answer indiscreet.
2155,THE OTHER,"One girl's caution made me sore,"
2156,THE OTHER,Too indignant even to greet
2157,THE OTHER,That other had we chanced to meet.
2158,THE OTHER,
2159,THE OTHER,I sought then in solitude.
2160,THE OTHER,The wind had fallen with the night; as still
2161,THE OTHER,"The roads lay as the ploughland rude,"
2162,THE OTHER,"Dark and naked, on the hill."
2163,THE OTHER,Had there been ever any feud
2164,THE OTHER,"'Twixt earth and sky, a mighty will"
2165,THE OTHER,"Closed it: the crocketed dark trees,"
2166,THE OTHER,"A dark house, dark impossible"
2167,THE OTHER,"Cloud-towers, one star, one lamp, one peace"
2168,THE OTHER,Held on an everlasting lease:
2169,THE OTHER,
2170,THE OTHER,"And all was earth's, or all was sky's;"
2171,THE OTHER,No difference endured between
2172,THE OTHER,The two. A dog barked on a hidden rise;
2173,THE OTHER,A marshbird whistled high unseen;
2174,THE OTHER,The latest waking blackbird's cries
2175,THE OTHER,Perished upon the silence keen.
2176,THE OTHER,The last light filled a narrow firth
2177,THE OTHER,"Among the clouds. I stood serene,"
2178,THE OTHER,"And with a solemn quiet mirth,"
2179,THE OTHER,An old inhabitant of earth.
2180,THE OTHER,
2181,THE OTHER,Once the name I gave to hours
2182,THE OTHER,"Like this was melancholy, when"
2183,THE OTHER,It was not happiness and powers
2184,THE OTHER,"Coming like exiles home again,"
2185,THE OTHER,"And weaknesses quitting their bowers,"
2186,THE OTHER,"Smiled and enjoyed, far off from men,"
2187,THE OTHER,Moments of everlastingness.
2188,THE OTHER,And fortunate my search was then
2189,THE OTHER,"While what I sought, nevertheless,"
2190,THE OTHER,"That I was seeking, I did not guess."
2191,THE OTHER,
2192,THE OTHER,That time was brief: once more at inn
2193,THE OTHER,And upon road I sought my man
2194,THE OTHER,Till once amid a tap-room's din
2195,THE OTHER,"Loudly he asked for me, began"
2196,THE OTHER,"To speak, as if it had been a sin,"
2197,THE OTHER,Of how I thought and dreamed and ran
2198,THE OTHER,"After him thus, day after day:"
2199,THE OTHER,He lived as one under a ban
2200,THE OTHER,For this: what had I got to say?
2201,THE OTHER,"I said nothing, I slipped away."
2202,THE OTHER,
2203,THE OTHER,And now I dare not follow after
2204,THE OTHER,"Too close. I try to keep in sight,"
2205,THE OTHER,Dreading his frown and worse his laughter.
2206,THE OTHER,I steal out of the wood to light;
2207,THE OTHER,I see the swift shoot from the rafter
2208,THE OTHER,By the inn door: ere I alight
2209,THE OTHER,I wait and hear the starlings wheeze
2210,THE OTHER,And nibble like ducks: I wait his flight.
2211,THE OTHER,He goes: I follow: no release
2212,THE OTHER,Until he ceases. Then I also shall cease.
2213,THE OTHER,

2220,HOUSE AND MAN,Empty it sounded. It was dark with forest boughs

2230,HOUSE AND MAN,A sigh that he converted to a laugh.
2231,HOUSE AND MAN,"He seemed to hang rather than stand there, half"

2233,HOUSE AND MAN,And useless on the brier where it has hung
2234,HOUSE AND MAN,Long years a-washing by sun and wind and rain.

2237,HOUSE AND MAN,Is that now on a beech-tree's tip I see
2238,HOUSE AND MAN,"As then I saw--I at the gate, and he"

2295,MAN AND DOG,The old man stared up at the mistletoe
2296,MAN AND DOG,That hung too high in the poplar's crest for plunder
2297,MAN AND DOG,"Of any climber, though not for kissing under:"
2298,MAN AND DOG,Then he went on against the north-east wind--
2299,MAN AND DOG,"Straight but lame, leaning on a staff new-skinned,"
2300,MAN AND DOG,"Carrying a brolly, flag-basket, and old coat,--"
2301,MAN AND DOG,"Towards Alton, ten miles off. And he had not"

2303,MAN AND DOG,"'Twere best, if he had had ""a money-box,"""
2304,MAN AND DOG,To have waited there till the sheep cleared a field

2320,MAN AND DOG,He laughed and whistled to the small brown bitch
2321,MAN AND DOG,With spots of blue that hunted in the ditch.
2322,MAN AND DOG,Her foxy Welsh grandfather must have paired
2323,MAN AND DOG,Beneath him. He kept sheep in Wales and scared
2324,MAN AND DOG,"Strangers, I will warrant, with his pearl eye"
2325,MAN AND DOG,"And trick of shrinking off as he were shy,"
2326,MAN AND DOG,Then following close in silence for--for what?
2327,MAN AND DOG,"""No rabbit, never fear, she ever got,"
2328,MAN AND DOG,Yet always hunts. To-day she nearly had one:

2331,MAN AND DOG,"She's not much use, but still she's company,"
2332,MAN AND DOG,Though I'm not. She goes everywhere with me.
2333,MAN AND DOG,So Alton I must reach to-night somehow:
2334,MAN AND DOG,I'll get no shakedown with that bedfellow
2335,MAN AND DOG,From farmers. Many a man sleeps worse to-night

2337,MAN AND DOG,right.
2338,MAN AND DOG,But they'll be out of that--I hope they be--
2339,MAN AND DOG,"This weather, marching after the enemy."""
2340,MAN AND DOG,"""And so I hope. Good luck."" And there I nodded"
2341,MAN AND DOG,"""Good-night. You keep straight on."" Stiffly he"
2342,MAN AND DOG,plodded;
2343,MAN AND DOG,"And at his heels the crisp leaves scurried fast,"
2344,MAN AND DOG,And the leaf-coloured robin watched. They
