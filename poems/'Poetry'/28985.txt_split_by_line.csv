30,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"It was Tord of Hafsborough,"

32,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"And there he lost his hammer of gold,"
33,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,'Twas lost for so long a tide.
34,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,
35,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"It was Tord of Hafsborough,"
36,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,His brother he addressed:
37,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"""Thou shalt away to the Norland hills,"
38,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"My hammer be thy quest."""
39,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,
40,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"It was Lokke Leyemand,"
41,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,A feather robe o'er him drew;
42,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,And away to the Norland mountains high
43,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,O'er the briny sea he flew.
44,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,
45,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,In the midst of the castle yard
46,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,He smoothed his array;
47,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"Then straight he took to the castle hall,"
48,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,To the carlish Count his way.
49,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,
50,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"""Be welcome, Lokke Leyemand,"
51,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,Be welcome my castle to;
52,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,Say! how fare things in Hafsborough?
53,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"With the land how does it go?"""
54,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,
55,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"""O, well fare things in Hafsborough,"
56,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,And well in the country all;
57,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"Tord has his golden hammer lost,"
58,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"Therefore seek I your hall."""
59,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,
60,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"""Tord he shall not his hammer get,"
61,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,Thou back may'st carry him word;
62,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,Full five-and-ninety fathoms deep
63,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,It lies in the earth interred.
64,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,
65,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"""Tord he shall not his hammer get,"
66,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"To thee I vow and swear,"
67,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"Save he give me Damsel Fridleifsborg,"
68,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"With all his goods and gear."""
69,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,
70,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"It was Lokke Leyemand,"
71,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,O'er himself the feather robe drew;
72,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,And with his answer back amain
73,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,O'er the briny sea he flew.
74,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,
75,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"""Thou never wilt get thy hammer of gold,"
76,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"Upon that thou may'st rely,"
77,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"Unless he have Damsel Fridleifsborg,"
78,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"And all our property."""
79,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,
80,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"Then answered straight the proud Damsel,"
81,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,Upon the bench as she sate:
82,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"""Ye'd better give me a Christian man,"
83,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,Than the laidly trold for mate.
84,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,
85,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"""But we will take our old father,"
86,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"And deck so fine his head,"
87,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"And we'll carry him to the Northern hills,"
88,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"To stand for bride in my stead."""
89,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,
90,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,And now to the house of the merry bridegroom
91,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,They the young old bride convey;
92,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"Upon her dress no gold was spared,"
93,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,For a verity I say.
94,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,
95,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"And so they took the lovely bride,"
96,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,On the bride-bench placed her frame;
97,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,And to skink before the bride himself
98,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,The carlish Count he came.
99,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,
100,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"Then she ate six oxen bodies,"
101,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,And three fat swine beside;
102,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"Loaves seven hundred were her meal,"
103,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,Ere for a draught she cried.
104,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,
105,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,Before her thirst she could assuage
106,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,She drank ten casks of ale;
107,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,She set the can once more to her mouth
108,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,And to hickuping then she fell.
109,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,
110,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"The carlish Count strode up and down,"
111,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,And wrung his hands so sore:
112,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"""O whence can this young bride be come?"
113,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"She does so much devour!"""
114,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,
115,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,The Count he called to his Botelere:
116,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"""Thou hadst better broach away,"
117,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"For we have here such a wondrous bride,"
118,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"She'll drink for ever and aye."""
119,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,
120,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"Answered then Lokke Leyemand,"
121,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,'Neath his sleeve he laughed with glee:
122,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"""For full eight days she has not ate."
123,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"She longed so much for thee."""
124,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,
125,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"Outspake the laidly carlish Count,"
126,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,And thus the Count did cry:
127,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"""O, call ye in my serving swains,"
128,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,Bid them come instantly.
129,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,
130,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"""Go, fetch me hither the hammer of gold,"
131,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,Glad I'll surrender it;
132,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"If I can either in honour or shame,"
133,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"Of such a young bride be quit."""
134,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,
135,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"The Kempions eight in number were,"
136,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,Who the hammer brought on a tree;
137,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,They laid it down so courteously
138,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,Across the young bride's knee.
139,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,
140,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,It was then the youthful bride
141,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,Took up the hammer big;
142,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,I tell to ye for a verity
143,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,She swung it like a twig.
144,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,
145,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"First she slew the carlish count,"
146,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,That throld both laid and tall;
147,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"And then as they strove to 'scape through the door,"
148,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,She slew the little trolds all.
149,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,
150,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,The guests and the Norland men each one
151,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,So downcast were of mood;
152,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,Blows from the hand of the bride they got
153,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,That robbed their cheeks of blood.
154,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,
155,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"It was Lokke Leyemand,"
156,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,He opened his mouth in game:
157,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"""Now we will fare to our country home,"
158,TORD OF HAFSBOROUGH,"And our sire a widow proclaim."""

179,THORVALD,Sir Thorvald hight;
180,THORVALD,"Though fierce in war, kind acts in peace"
181,THORVALD,Were his delight.
182,THORVALD,From port to port his vessels fast
183,THORVALD,"Sailed wide around,"
184,THORVALD,"And made, where'er they anchor cast,"
185,THORVALD,His name renown'd.

187,THORVALD,
188,THORVALD,"Prisoners he bought--clothes, liberty,"
189,THORVALD,"On them bestowed,"
190,THORVALD,And sent men home from slavery
191,THORVALD,To their abode.
192,THORVALD,"And many an old man got his boy,"
193,THORVALD,His age's stay;
194,THORVALD,"And many a maid her youth's sole joy,"
195,THORVALD,Her lover gay.
196,THORVALD,_But Thorvald has freed his King_.
197,THORVALD,
198,THORVALD,"A brave fight Thorvald loved full dear,"
199,THORVALD,For brave his mood;
200,THORVALD,But never did he dip his spear
201,THORVALD,In feeble blood.
202,THORVALD,He followed Swayne to many a fray
203,THORVALD,"With war-shield bright,"
204,THORVALD,And his mere presence scar'd away
205,THORVALD,Foul deeds of might.
206,THORVALD,_But Thorvald has freed his King_.
207,THORVALD,
208,THORVALD,"They hoist sail on the lofty mast,"
209,THORVALD,"It was King Swayne,"
210,THORVALD,He o'er the bluey billows pass'd
211,THORVALD,With armed train.
212,THORVALD,His mind to harry Bretland {13a} boiled;
213,THORVALD,He leapt on shore
214,THORVALD,"And every, every thing recoiled"
215,THORVALD,His might before.
216,THORVALD,_But Thorvald has freed his King_.
217,THORVALD,

219,THORVALD,He speedily
220,THORVALD,Collected a host in the dark wood
221,THORVALD,Of cavalry.
222,THORVALD,And evil through that subtle plan
223,THORVALD,Befell the Dane;
224,THORVALD,"They were ta'en prisoners every man,"
225,THORVALD,And last King Swayne.
226,THORVALD,_But Thorvald has freed his King_.
227,THORVALD,
228,THORVALD,"""Now hear thou prison-foogd! {13b} and pray"
229,THORVALD,My message heed;

231,THORVALD,Thence Thorvald lead!
232,THORVALD,"Prison and chains become him not,"
233,THORVALD,Whose gallant hand
234,THORVALD,So many a handsome lad has brought
235,THORVALD,"From slavery's band."""
236,THORVALD,_But Thorvald has freed his King_.
237,THORVALD,
238,THORVALD,The man brought this intelligence

252,THORVALD,"And from that hour unto his grave,"
253,THORVALD,Swayne ever show'd
254,THORVALD,"Towards his youth's friend, so true and brave,"
255,THORVALD,Fit gratitude.
256,THORVALD,_But Thorvald has freed his King_.
257,THORVALD,

261,THORVALD,"""Sit, Thorvald, here."
262,THORVALD,Thy father ne'er rul'd land like me
263,THORVALD,And my compeers!

294,PETER COLBIORNSEN,Such heavy blows the Norsemen deal

427,KRAGELILL,"""Thou shalt to me thy father name,"
428,KRAGELILL,"Or thou shall lose thy life."""
429,KRAGELILL,
430,KRAGELILL,"""Sigurd the King my father is,"
431,KRAGELILL,His Queen my mother dear;
432,KRAGELILL,"And I myself am Swanelill,"
433,KRAGELILL,"Name fitting for me to bear."""
434,KRAGELILL,
435,KRAGELILL,Then o'er her threw the mantle blue
436,KRAGELILL,"Regnfred, the King's good son;"
437,KRAGELILL,He lifted her so courteously
438,KRAGELILL,His courser grey upon.
439,KRAGELILL,
440,KRAGELILL,"And he rode o'er the meadows green,"
441,KRAGELILL,And over the plains so wide;
442,KRAGELILL,"Behind him came running an ancient man,"
443,KRAGELILL,And so loud on Kragelill cried.
444,KRAGELILL,
445,KRAGELILL,"But the swain gave him both silver and gold,"
446,KRAGELILL,Contented away he hied;
447,KRAGELILL,Then he unhindered did carry the maid
448,KRAGELILL,To her father's halls of pride.
449,KRAGELILL,
450,KRAGELILL,"Now has Regnfred, the King's son,"
451,KRAGELILL,O'ercome his dire distress;
452,KRAGELILL,He sleeps each night so joyously
453,KRAGELILL,In the arms of his princess.
454,KRAGELILL,
455,KRAGELILL,And now is Damsel Swanelill
456,KRAGELILL,To kith and kin restored;
457,KRAGELILL,So joyously she sleeps each night
458,KRAGELILL,With Regnfred her wedded lord.

466,ALLEGAST,"The Count such a store of gold had got,"
467,ALLEGAST,His equal for wealth in the land was not.
468,ALLEGAST,
469,ALLEGAST,"But the Count he had of a hare the heart,"
470,ALLEGAST,At the slightest thing he with fear would start.
471,ALLEGAST,
472,ALLEGAST,"Yet at last he grew of courage so rife,"
473,ALLEGAST,That he wooed the King's daughter to be his wife.
474,ALLEGAST,
475,ALLEGAST,"Then answer made Carl, the son of the King:"
476,ALLEGAST,I ne'er will consent to such shameful thing.
477,ALLEGAST,
478,ALLEGAST,"""For he served my father like a knave,"
479,ALLEGAST,He'll not bear on his helm the stroke of a glaive.
480,ALLEGAST,
481,ALLEGAST,"""Last year the King's coursers he helped to groom,"
482,ALLEGAST,"This year he'll to wed the King's daughter presume."""
483,ALLEGAST,
484,ALLEGAST,"Nought booted all Carl, the King's son, could say;"
485,ALLEGAST,'Gainst the wish of her brother they gave her away.
486,ALLEGAST,
487,ALLEGAST,"Dreamt Carl, the King's son, on his night-couch laid,"
488,ALLEGAST,That he would take up the thieving trade.
489,ALLEGAST,
490,ALLEGAST,"""May the Lord God grant I the man may find,"
491,ALLEGAST,Who best can steal of the thieving kind.
492,ALLEGAST,
493,ALLEGAST,"""God grant that I in with Allegast fall,"
494,ALLEGAST,"Who best can steal of the world's thieves all."""
495,ALLEGAST,
496,ALLEGAST,"Early at morn the day shone clear,"
497,ALLEGAST,"From the house Carl, the King's son, rode in career."
498,ALLEGAST,
499,ALLEGAST,"And when to the castle gate he had won,"
500,ALLEGAST,"There Allegast stood, and leaned thereupon."
501,ALLEGAST,
502,ALLEGAST,"""What kind of man, my friend, may you be,"
503,ALLEGAST,"Whom loitering here by the gate I see?"""
504,ALLEGAST,
505,ALLEGAST,"""The folks, young Sir, me Allegast call,"
506,ALLEGAST,"I am the best thief of the world's thieves all."""
507,ALLEGAST,
508,ALLEGAST,"""Then we'll to each other a solemn oath give,"
509,ALLEGAST,To steal and to thieve all the days that we live.
510,ALLEGAST,
511,ALLEGAST,"""Now we will away to the house of the Count,"
512,ALLEGAST,"And the courser we'll steal which to ride he is wont."""
513,ALLEGAST,
514,ALLEGAST,"And when they arrived on the verdant plain,"
515,ALLEGAST,Into hot dispute fell the comrades twain.
516,ALLEGAST,
517,ALLEGAST,"They disputed which should break the wall,"
518,ALLEGAST,They disputed which therethrough should crawl.
519,ALLEGAST,
520,ALLEGAST,"But Allegast he should break down the wall,"
521,ALLEGAST,And Allegast he should creep through withall.
522,ALLEGAST,
523,ALLEGAST,"""But how shall we bear the Count's saddle away?"
524,ALLEGAST,"So many bells that saddle array."""
525,ALLEGAST,
526,ALLEGAST,The Count to his page that evening said:
527,ALLEGAST,"""My saddle wipe, ere thou get thee to bed."
528,ALLEGAST,
529,ALLEGAST,"""For to-morrow I'm bent to ride to the Ting,"
530,ALLEGAST,"I'll have Carl hanged, the son of the King."""
531,ALLEGAST,
532,ALLEGAST,Then the Countess in bitter grief answer made:
533,ALLEGAST,"""You'll ne'er live so long as to see him dead."
534,ALLEGAST,
535,ALLEGAST,"""My father's servant last year thou wast,"
536,ALLEGAST,"Now to sleep with his daughter the honour thou hast."""
537,ALLEGAST,
538,ALLEGAST,"The Count at that word so ireful grew,"
539,ALLEGAST,He smote his wife that the blood out-flew.
540,ALLEGAST,
541,ALLEGAST,"At hand was Sir Carl, heard all they spake:"
542,ALLEGAST,"""I soon of this matter an end will make."""
543,ALLEGAST,
544,ALLEGAST,"Then Carl he entered through the door,"
545,ALLEGAST,And a naked sword in his hand he bore.
546,ALLEGAST,
547,ALLEGAST,"""Thou dog, thou shalt never more have the might"
548,ALLEGAST,The gentle daughters of Kings to smite.
549,ALLEGAST,
550,ALLEGAST,"""Thou dog, thou shalt never more have the power"
551,ALLEGAST,"To threaten Kings' children within thy bower."""
552,ALLEGAST,
553,ALLEGAST,"The Count by his long yellow locks he took,"
554,ALLEGAST,And by the bed's side his head off strook.
555,ALLEGAST,
556,ALLEGAST,"""Do thou lie there, and for ever be banned,"
557,ALLEGAST,I'll bestow on another my sister's hand.
558,ALLEGAST,
559,ALLEGAST,"""I'll give her Sir Allegast, he is a knight"
560,ALLEGAST,"So true and trusty and valiant in fight."""
561,ALLEGAST,
562,ALLEGAST,"The King's sweet daughter has Allegast wed,"
563,ALLEGAST,For her infamous husband unwept lies dead.
564,ALLEGAST,
565,ALLEGAST,"These gallants were thieves in no other way,"
566,ALLEGAST,Than that they a trick on the Count would play.
567,ALLEGAST,
568,ALLEGAST,"But could all thieving come to so fair an end,"
569,ALLEGAST,"There's many, I trow, would a-thieving wend!"
