145,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Around the gray-green trees
146,TABLE OF CONTENTS,In early spring?
147,TABLE OF CONTENTS,It is then the snow-white trillium
148,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Gleam like stars from the carpet
149,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Of last year's leaves:
150,TABLE OF CONTENTS,And tall white violets glow
151,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Like clouds of nebul√¶ along the path.
152,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"And flecked, like points of light"

181,TABLE OF CONTENTS,A spray of orange berries etched against the silver of a stone wall:
182,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
183,TABLE OF CONTENTS,A scarlet vine encircling a golden sapling;
184,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
185,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"On the ground, a carmine robe that had slipped from the shoulders of"

187,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
188,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"A sweep of meadow,"
189,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"A curve of bronzy hill,"

203,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"And softly echoed,"
204,TABLE OF CONTENTS,As he slipped into the embrace
205,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Of the night.
206,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"So pure, so holy, was his song"
207,TABLE OF CONTENTS,That my heart was calmed

254,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Softly whirring comes
255,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"The vivid humming-bird,"

270,TABLE OF CONTENTS,I love to tread a winding path
271,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Through the woods,"
272,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"And, world weary, pause upon it."
273,TABLE OF CONTENTS,The trees bend and enclose me
274,TABLE OF CONTENTS,In brooding calm;
275,TABLE OF CONTENTS,I feel the presence of Deity.
276,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
277,TABLE OF CONTENTS,I hear the cadence of the stillness--
278,TABLE OF CONTENTS,A stillness so alive.
279,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"The whisper of the leaves,"
280,TABLE OF CONTENTS,The song of the brook over golden stone
281,TABLE OF CONTENTS,The whir of a bird's wings;
282,TABLE OF CONTENTS,And I know the presence of Deity.

327,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"In early evening,"

329,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Or at their doors
330,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"In peace and contentment,"
331,TABLE OF CONTENTS,I long to stop and speak to them.
332,TABLE OF CONTENTS,They might tell me of a loved one
333,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Doing some great work
334,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"In a big city,"
335,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Or of a deep sorrow,"
336,TABLE OF CONTENTS,And I might say a word
337,TABLE OF CONTENTS,To help lighten it.
338,TABLE OF CONTENTS,They might show me treasured china
339,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Or a bit of lace, handmade;"
340,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Once some one did.
341,TABLE OF CONTENTS,And I could talk with the children.
342,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"I long to do this,"
343,TABLE OF CONTENTS,But it always seems

359,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Undaunted by the roar,"
360,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Unmindful of the churning,"
361,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Of the terror of its power,"
362,TABLE OF CONTENTS,On sure pinions

379,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
380,TABLE OF CONTENTS,In summer moonlight
381,TABLE OF CONTENTS,When a soft wind stirs
382,TABLE OF CONTENTS,She dances with a delicate sapling.
383,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"They sway and bend in the wind,"

387,TABLE OF CONTENTS,In autumn she dances
388,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"With beech leaves in her hair,"

401,TABLE OF CONTENTS,There is a spot in the woods
402,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"That is ""forever England"" to me."
403,TABLE OF CONTENTS,A clump of beech trees
404,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Steeped in silence,"
405,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Whose shade and solitude
406,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Shuts me in with my dreams.
407,TABLE OF CONTENTS,The sunshine slants through
408,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Their limpid leaves
409,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"And turns them to translucent jade,"
410,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Just as it does in an English spring.
411,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Violets are there, and I pluck them,"

421,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
422,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Down among the docks and elevators and railroad tracks
423,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"On the way out of the city,"
424,TABLE OF CONTENTS,I pass a tiny cottage so rickety
425,TABLE OF CONTENTS,That its neighbors crowd close
426,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"To hold it up. But there it is,"
427,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Its one window shining clean, and glowing"
428,TABLE OF CONTENTS,With a plant in a tin can and pure white curtains.
429,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Hanging over the fence and filling the whole place
430,TABLE OF CONTENTS,With its beauty and almost hiding the cottage
431,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Is a peach tree in full bloom.
432,TABLE OF CONTENTS,In the doorway I glimpse a girl
433,TABLE OF CONTENTS,In a purple dress.
434,TABLE OF CONTENTS,But what matters the smoke and the noise and the fog

449,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"He sees more than I,"
450,TABLE OF CONTENTS,But he cannot hear
451,TABLE OF CONTENTS,What I hear.
452,TABLE OF CONTENTS,
453,TABLE OF CONTENTS,I hear the wood-thrush
454,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"And the veery,"
455,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Answer each other.
456,TABLE OF CONTENTS,I hear the voices
457,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Of happy children
458,TABLE OF CONTENTS,And the baying of hounds
459,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Float up from the valley;
460,TABLE OF CONTENTS,The chirp of the cricket
461,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"At my feet, and, then,"
462,TABLE OF CONTENTS,The silence of nightfall.
463,TABLE OF CONTENTS,

478,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Quite different

480,TABLE OF CONTENTS,As if the bronzy leaves
481,TABLE OF CONTENTS,Had much to say
482,TABLE OF CONTENTS,"Before they part,"
483,TABLE OF CONTENTS,And were loath
