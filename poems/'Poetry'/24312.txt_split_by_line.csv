70,_PREFACE._,I am fully aware of the fact that the present volume is but an
71,_PREFACE._,"intrusion at the best; however, I trust my readers will be pleased to"
72,_PREFACE._,overlook the many faults of a bagatelle as insignificant and pitiable
73,_PREFACE._,as its author.
74,_PREFACE._,
75,_PREFACE._,In the following pages I have introduced the first canto of Midsummer
76,_PREFACE._,"Idylls in a revised form, and it has been my especial care to correct,"
77,_PREFACE._,"as far as it was consistent with the meaning of the passage, any hitch"
78,_PREFACE._,in the Iambic Measure which might offend the ear. An author has
79,_PREFACE._,"himself to please as well as his public, and it has been to me a"
80,_PREFACE._,"matter of much study that the Iambics should be as pure, or at least"
81,_PREFACE._,"as tolerable, as circumstances would allow, though, while I can ill"
82,_PREFACE._,"permit an irregular or inharmonious line, I hope I may not be found"
83,_PREFACE._,guilty of sacrificing sense to sound. I beg to tender those my most
84,_PREFACE._,"cordial thanks who have dealt indulgently with my rhymes hitherto, and"
85,_PREFACE._,"to acknowledge, with profound gratitude, the kind encouragement of"
86,_PREFACE._,those great men of letters who have condescended to notice so small a
87,_PREFACE._,"bard. The opinions of the Metropolitan, Provincial, and Foreign Press"
88,_PREFACE._,"could not have been other than gratifying to me, and it is with a"
89,_PREFACE._,humble hope of favour that I submit the following pages to a
90,_PREFACE._,discerning public.

141,CANTO I.,
142,I.,I.
143,I.,
144,I.,It was the time of year when cockneys fly
145,I.,"From town to country, and from there to town."
146,I.,"I am not sure, but think it was July;"
147,I.,"I would not swear it was, nor bet a crown,"
148,I.,"When, as I told you, cockneys hurry down"
149,I.,"In two hours' railway journey far away,"
150,I.,"And rush to places of immense renown,"
151,I.,"Bright with the thoughts of coming holiday,"
152,I.,Full well determined to enjoy it while they may.
153,I.,
154,I.,
155,II.,II.
156,II.,
157,II.,They were the days when all who care to wander
158,II.,"O'er the rude mountain or the fertile plain,"
159,II.,"Must snatch the chance, and rush here, there and yonder,"
160,II.,"And pack their baggage off by early train,"
161,II.,"To rest the busy over-anxious brain,"
162,II.,And take to interests altogether new.
163,II.,"Some tear to Italy, and some to Spain,"
164,II.,For beneficial air and change of view;
165,II.,What everybody does that I must also do.
166,II.,
167,II.,
168,III.,III.
169,III.,
170,III.,"The sun was scorching, and the streets were dusty,--"
171,III.,"Suburban roadways generally are,--"
172,III.,"And everything seemed disagreeably ""fusty,"""
173,III.,Merely because there was no watering car.
174,III.,It was the weather when we feel at war
175,III.,With all around and everyone we meet;
176,III.,"Old dames complained of aches unknown before,"
177,III.,"Unused to battle with such dreadful heat,"
178,III.,"Such truly fearful spasms, and such blistered feet."
179,III.,
180,III.,
181,IV.,IV.
182,IV.,
183,IV.,The 'buses went by clockwork by the appearance;
184,IV.,"Th' exalted driver, usually so deft,"
185,IV.,"Resented, in his doze, the interference"
186,IV.,Of any one poor fellow-suff'rer left;
187,IV.,"Of all his strength and energy bereft,"
188,IV.,"The weary horse dragged listlessly along,"
189,IV.,And there appeared to be no effort left
190,IV.,"In the sleepy trilling of the songster's song,"
191,IV.,Which to the small suburban gardens did belong.
192,IV.,
193,IV.,
194,V.,V.
195,V.,
196,V.,Now the slow music of the organ-grinder
197,V.,"Smites the ear feebly at the noon of day,"
198,V.,"He doffs his hat, as if for a reminder,"
199,V.,To those who wish him far enough away;
200,V.,And noisy babes at variance and play
201,V.,"Join in the jangle of the grocery vendor,"
202,V.,And butcher boys have lots and lots to say
203,V.,"To fair domestics, who their hearts surrender"
204,V.,"To, if not a butcher boy, a kettle mender."
205,V.,
206,V.,
207,VI.,VI.
208,VI.,
209,VI.,But more especially I would direct
210,VI.,"Your kind attention, reader, to a square"
211,VI.,"In that locality, tho' more select,"
212,VI.,So thither now together we'll repair.
213,VI.,A bold and lofty tenement stands there
214,VI.,"With flight of steps and massive portico,"
215,VI.,Where dwelt three daughters infinitely fair;
216,VI.,"Their age of course I'm not _supposed_ to know,"
217,VI.,'Twas very rude I own to raise the question so.
218,VI.,
219,VI.,
220,VII.,VII.
221,VII.,
222,VII.,But as you all seem anxious to discover
223,VII.,"Their years, their fortune, and the gods know what;"
224,VII.,"To hear if each or all had found a lover,"
225,VII.,"If one engaged or if they all were not,"
226,VII.,"How many aunts and uncles they had got,"
227,VII.,"Their nic-nacs of domestic life beside,"
228,VII.,Your indignation would be somewhat hot
229,VII.,"If th' information were to be denied,"
230,VII.,"And since you'll have it so, the truth I will not hide."
231,VII.,
232,VII.,
233,VIII.,VIII.
234,VIII.,
235,VIII.,"You know most ladies have some slight objection,"
236,VIII.,"Some strange objection which they always raise,"
237,VIII.,And arm themselves as if for the protection
238,VIII.,"Of the sweet sanctum of their earlier days,"
239,VIII.,Toward those who flatteringly speak their praise
240,VIII.,"And ask in special confidence their years,"
241,VIII.,Who pass the time in fifty pleasant ways
242,VIII.,"And designate them ""charms"" and ""pretty dears,"""
243,VIII.,Beset with all those unimaginable fears!
244,VIII.,
245,VIII.,
246,IX.,IX.
247,IX.,
248,IX.,Of course none of my heroines were wed;
249,IX.,The eldest--fancy--only twenty-two!
250,IX.,"At least so all the neighbours' gossip said,"
251,IX.,"And they, of course, were all who really knew;"
252,IX.,"Of medium height, and lovely spinsters too,"
253,IX.,"Charmingly gentle as they well could be,"
254,IX.,"With accomplishments and graces not a few,"
255,IX.,"As generous as one could wish to see,"
256,IX.,The very pictures of sweet joviality.
257,IX.,
258,IX.,
259,X.,X.
260,X.,
261,X.,A dozen uncles and as many aunts
262,X.,Were the idols of their precious little eyes;
263,X.,And it was whispered that there was a chance
264,X.,"With Fate auspicious, of a great surprise"
265,X.,At some approaching day; 'tis never wise
266,X.,"To form conjectures or to fret and worry,"
267,X.,"To count your gains before Aunt Some-one dies,"
268,X.,"E'en though possessed of half the land in Surrey,"
269,X.,Or draw your own conclusions in too great a hurry.
270,X.,
271,X.,
272,XI.,XI.
273,XI.,
274,XI.,"All information, as perchance, you know,"
275,XI.,Is second hand; I write as folks dictate;
276,XI.,A Mrs. B. tells Mr. So-and-So
277,XI.,Th' extent of some-one's personal estate;
278,XI.,He in his turn the same again will prate;
279,XI.,A Mr. C. has struck his little wife
280,XI.,"Is the last movement worthy to relate,"
281,XI.,"'Tis now affirmed he took away her life,"
282,XI.,In the next terrace where th' appalling tale is rife.
283,XI.,
284,XI.,
285,XII.,XII.
286,XII.,
287,XII.,"'Tis sometimes so, for other people's business"
288,XII.,"Wise men and women oft forsake their own,"
289,XII.,"Which may perhaps account for their remissness,"
290,XII.,A tittle-tattle's never seen alone;
291,XII.,And by the time the idle tale has flown
292,XII.,"From mouth to mouth, the truth in some disguise,"
293,XII.,A trifling circumstance we find has grown
294,XII.,"A crime of most unpardonable size,"
295,XII.,And thunder-struck believers stare in mute surprise.
296,XII.,
297,XII.,
298,XIII.,XIII.
299,XIII.,
300,XIII.,"But, sad to say, our friends were looking pale,"
301,XIII.,"Our female friends, at least, I mean to say,"
302,XIII.,We will not try to penetrate the veil
303,XIII.,Which hides domestic mystery away;
304,XIII.,It was not often that they looked that way.
305,XIII.,Perhaps the atmosphere of such a place
306,XIII.,As the metropolis on such a day
307,XIII.,"Had made them faint, as often is the case:"
308,XIII.,The cause in feminines is often hard to trace.
309,XIII.,
310,XIII.,
311,XIV.,XIV.
312,XIV.,
313,XIV.,"But still, methinks, it was the want of change"
314,XIV.,"That blanched the buxom beauty of their cheeks,"
315,XIV.,"The want of some secluded, pleasant grange"
316,XIV.,"Away from town, for twelve or thirteen weeks,"
317,XIV.,The hilarity of right down country freaks
318,XIV.,"And rambles in the meadows bright and green,"
319,XIV.,"Such as the ""pater"" usually seeks,"
320,XIV.,With charming walks and panoramic scene
321,XIV.,And velvet-like ascents with verdant vales between.
322,XIV.,
323,XIV.,
324,XV.,XV.
325,XV.,
326,XV.,"'Twas evident the fair ones thought so too,"
327,XV.,As they suggested to their fond mamma
328,XV.,"A short peregrination, something new,"
329,XV.,"A rush to country and to town ta-ta,"
330,XV.,For benefits obtained but from afar;
331,XV.,"So 'twas arranged, when they could choose the hour,"
332,XV.,"To make a fourfold pounce upon papa,"
333,XV.,"And use the utmost of persuasive ""flour,"""
334,XV.,For all such daughters have this undefinéd power.
335,XV.,
336,XV.,
337,XVI.,XVI.
338,XVI.,
339,XVI.,'Twould be as well perhaps to mention here
340,XVI.,"A fact you all no doubt are sure to know,"
341,XVI.,'Tis necessary oftentimes to steer
342,XVI.,"Clear of surrounding difficulties, so"
343,XVI.,When an especial object lies below
344,XVI.,"The precision of your kindness and attention,"
345,XVI.,Snatch the right time (a glance may serve to show
346,XVI.,"If in a mood for jesting or dissension,"
347,XVI.,Domestic trials are too numerous to mention).
348,XVI.,
349,XVI.,
350,XVII.,XVII.
351,XVII.,
352,XVII.,"It may be p'raps a trifling _mauvaise humeur_,"
353,XVII.,"Papa may worry o'er his own affairs,"
354,XVII.,"Or it, perchance, may be a downright ""fumer,"""
355,XVII.,And judging from the countenance he wears
356,XVII.,"He may be vexed with sundry business cares,"
357,XVII.,"A something he would not communicate,"
358,XVII.,"In which the happy household never shares,"
359,XVII.,"It is not wise it should, at any rate;"
360,XVII.,At least till matters have regained their even state.
361,XVII.,
362,XVII.,
363,XVIII.,XVIII.
364,XVIII.,
365,XVIII.,The morn which followed this determination
366,XVIII.,"Was just such as our damsels did desire,"
367,XVIII.,"Now all the world was out for its vacation,"
368,XVIII.,In truth no opportunity was nigher;
369,XVIII.,All seemed to rise with spirits somewhat higher
370,XVIII.,"Which were at most times jocular and gay,"
371,XVIII.,And all agreed that they should seize their sire
372,XVIII.,"A time befitting on that self-same day,"
373,XVIII.,To coax him gently round to let them have their way.
374,XVIII.,
375,XVIII.,
376,XIX.,XIX.
377,XIX.,
378,XIX.,"Paterfamilias, in his morning gown"
379,XIX.,"And wool-knit slippers, comfortable and pretty,"

863,LVI.,"Of massy polished stairs, and saw a mouse,"
864,LVI.,P'raps three or four appalled their wond'ring sight;
865,LVI.,"But each new comfort gave them fresh delight,"
866,LVI.,And as they peeped through each dark-curtained door
867,LVI.,"All seemed so perfectly compact and bright,"
868,LVI.,"Indeed they seemed to like it more and more,"
869,LVI.,For they had never entered such a house before.

871,LVI.,
872,LVII.,LVII.
873,LVII.,
874,LVII.,"The furniture was heavy in its kind,"
875,LVII.,"And all the drap'ry was of sombre shade,"
876,LVII.,"Evidently in days long past designed,"
877,LVII.,"And diamond casements, I before have said,"
878,LVII.,"Looked on a lawn, in richest green arrayed,"
879,LVII.,And lands beyond unto the distance blue
880,LVII.,"Where king-cups blossom'd in the silent glade,"
881,LVII.,"And all the flow'rets of the forest grew,"
882,LVII.,And pearly streams were tinged with their reflected hue.
883,LVII.,
884,LVII.,
885,LVIII.,LVIII.
886,LVIII.,
887,LVIII.,Upstairs the rooms were hung with glacé chintz
888,LVIII.,"(So like the good old farm-house of past days),"
889,LVIII.,"Which gave them a variety of tints,"
890,LVIII.,And pleased at once the weary stranger's gaze;
891,LVIII.,The doors themselves were covered with green baize
892,LVIII.,"Hidden with crimson curtains, and each bed"
893,LVIII.,Was draped in style that claimed the greatest praise
894,LVIII.,"In charming sky-blue intermixed with red,"
895,LVIII.,With pockets of unique design above the head.

900,LIX.,"They fed the pigs with biscuits, and the fowls"
901,LIX.,"Were soon quite reconciled to their new friends,"
902,LIX.,And the great shepherd-dog's uncivil growls
903,LIX.,"Had quite subsided and, instead, he sends"
904,LIX.,His kind regards for various means and ends;
905,LIX.,"And I expect, if th' real truth were known,"
906,LIX.,"He had an appetite, which always tends"
907,LIX.,To make uncouth pups civil for a bone;
908,LIX.,To use civility in this way some are prone.

912,LX.,
913,LX.,"Sometimes, like others do, they drove about"
914,LX.,"With a _recherché_ little chaise and pair,"
915,LX.,And they enjoyed a pic-nic oft no doubt
916,LX.,In pretty spots now here and sometimes there;
917,LX.,And we all know the fingers of the fair
918,LX.,"Arrange these matters sweetly, for they suit"
919,LX.,"Matters requiring delicacy and care,"
920,LX.,"The choice of flowers, the arrangement of the fruit,"
921,LX.,And digging ferns up without injuring the root.

924,LXI.,LXI.
925,LXI.,
926,LXI.,"They loved to play at croquet on the lawn,"
927,LXI.,"Adventurously rove a league away,"
928,LXI.,Or bend their steps upon the summer morn
929,LXI.,"(A mile it was, I fancy), to the bay,"
930,LXI.,Taking a biscuit-luncheon on the way.
931,LXI.,"To wander o'er the shining, yellow sands,"
932,LXI.,"Quiet and lone, and watch the snowy spray;"
933,LXI.,"And take the curious seaweeds in their hands,"

938,LXII.,
939,LXII.,"Yes, those were jolly days; and now the fields"
940,LXII.,"With happy haymakers were scattered o'er,"
941,LXII.,And Papa went to know their different yields
942,LXII.,"Through quite a hundred acres, if not more,"
943,LXII.,"Not less, at any rate, I am quite sure;"
944,LXII.,And all his daughters had some first-rate fun
945,LXII.,(They always had some merriment in store)
946,LXII.,"For haymaking to learn they had begun,"
947,LXII.,And often had a romp beneath the baking sun.

950,LXIII.,LXIII.
951,LXIII.,
952,LXIII.,"In fact it gave them something nice to do,"
953,LXIII.,"Moreover 'twas a fav'rite occupation,"
954,LXIII.,And that chanced very fortunately too;
955,LXIII.,"Meanwhile they liked some light confabulation,"
956,LXIII.,"Making arrangements for their bright vacation,"
957,LXIII.,"And plans far too entangled, I'm afraid,"
958,LXIII.,"To enumerate in this uncouth narration,"
959,LXIII.,"For if upon such topics here I strayed,"
960,LXIII.,"'Twould take from now till doomsday, so it's best unsaid."
961,LXIII.,
962,LXIII.,
963,LXIV.,LXIV.
964,LXIV.,
965,LXIV.,They'd had a call or two from neighbours near
966,LXIV.,Whose company was jovial as could be;
967,LXIV.,So their Mamma first started the idea
968,LXIV.,That they should ask three gentlemen to tea
969,LXIV.,"Out in the hayfield, where they would be free,"
970,LXIV.,To help in tossing o'er the scented hay;
971,LXIV.,"Then all assemble underneath the tree,"
972,LXIV.,"And chatter anything they'd like to say,"
973,LXIV.,While Julia handed round refreshment on a tray.
974,LXIV.,
975,LXIV.,
976,LXV.,LXV.
977,LXV.,
978,LXV.,"All was decided, and a note was sent,"
979,LXV.,"Penned with Mamma's gold pen and sealed with care,"
980,LXV.,And Julia brought a note to the intent
981,LXV.,That they would be most happy to be there;
982,LXV.,And whereon everybody did declare
983,LXV.,"They were the nicest folks beneath the sun,"
984,LXV.,And Julia did most naturally stare
985,LXV.,"To hear the happy thing that they had done,"
986,LXV.,And longed to see arrangements instantly begun.
987,LXV.,
988,LXV.,
989,LXVI.,LXVI.
990,LXVI.,
991,LXVI.,The daughters three received exact directions
992,LXVI.,How to do all things and go everywhere:
993,LXVI.,Concerning all their musical selections
994,LXVI.,"And all about the ""skirts"" they had to wear,"
995,LXVI.,"How they should dress and e'en adorn their hair,"
996,LXVI.,"What rings to show, whether diamond or not;"
997,LXVI.,Injunctions to observe the greatest care
998,LXVI.,"In choice of stockings, and I don't know what."
999,LXVI.,(They were to be like fairies in Calypso's grot.)
1000,LXVI.,
1001,LXVI.,
1002,LXVII.,LXVII.
1003,LXVII.,
1004,LXVII.,Of daughters all they were the most adored
1005,LXVII.,I honestly believe. Mamma impressed
1006,LXVII.,The fact upon them that a certain Lord
1007,LXVII.,"Was of _her_ family, tho' dispossessed"
1008,LXVII.,"Of all he had: of course you know the rest,"
1009,LXVII.,"He had been acting very ill, you see."
1010,LXVII.,"But they should make acquaintance with the best,"
1011,LXVII.,For think what claims they had of pedigree!
1012,LXVII.,(Misfortune always lends a grace to dignity.)
1013,LXVII.,
1014,LXVII.,
1015,LXVIII.,LXVIII.
1016,LXVIII.,
1017,LXVIII.,"They were to see the maid decant the wines,"
1018,LXVIII.,"They were to give the gentlemen their dues,"
1019,LXVIII.,"They were to be _distinguées_ to the nines,"
1020,LXVIII.,"They were, in short, to mind their p's and q's."
1021,LXVIII.,Their darling mother never would excuse
1022,LXVIII.,"A breach of etiquette, however small,"
1023,LXVIII.,"'Twere better far, if e'en they fail'd t' amuse,"
1024,LXVIII.,"To do the honours well or not at all,"
1025,LXVIII.,"No matter when or where, at _any_ festival."

1027,LXVIII.,
1028,LXIX.,LXIX.
1029,LXIX.,
1030,LXIX.,"In fact, 'twas this my reader, as you see,"
1031,LXIX.,For one high-born like her all _must_ be right;
1032,LXIX.,For she was of the aristocracy
1033,LXIX.,And therefore quite expected to her sight
1034,LXIX.,"None would present himself, unless the height"
1035,LXIX.,"Of spotless honour and of gentle birth,"
1036,LXIX.,In fewer words--and everything polite.
1037,LXIX.,"_She_ was of more than ordinary worth,"
1038,LXIX.,One of the noblest from Thanet's Isle to Solway Firth.
1039,LXIX.,
1040,LXIX.,
1041,LXX.,LXX.
1042,LXX.,
1043,LXX.,"But she had seen her fifty years of life,"
1044,LXX.,"So her young days for ever had swept by,"
1045,LXX.,And back to days e'er she became a wife
1046,LXX.,"She looked and for them breathed a lingering sigh,"
1047,LXX.,(As women often do upon the sly.)
1048,LXX.,"To tell the truth, my reader, I don't blame 'em"
1049,LXX.,"For thinking hardly of the marriage tie,"
1050,LXX.,"Most men's delight is not to love but tame 'em,"
1051,LXX.,I know a score but 'twouldn't do to name 'em.
1052,LXX.,
1053,LXX.,
1054,LXXI.,LXXI.
1055,LXXI.,
1056,LXXI.,No doubt she'd danced with all the proud and high
1057,LXXI.,"And revelled in the pomp of this vain earth,"
1058,LXXI.,"Enjoyed that mimic farce--Society,"
1059,LXXI.,"Entitled by significance of birth,"
1060,LXXI.,"But what of this! Society's not mirth,"
1061,LXXI.,"It has its fairer and its darker side,"
1062,LXXI.,"The one is worth, the other--want of worth,"
1063,LXXI.,What are the hollow luxuries of Pride?
1064,LXXI.,Oh gaze not on the gloom its dazzling tinsels hide!

1071,LXXII.,"Of mighty London, under Fashion's smile,"
1072,LXXII.,(Tho' redundant pleasures even can molest)
1073,LXXII.,"And feel one's happy self supremely blest,"
1074,LXXII.,"And bowed to by a ""humble flunkey flat,"""
1075,LXXII.,With endless formal courtesies oppressed;
1076,LXXII.,"To flirt with Baron this or Lady that,"
1077,LXXII.,"And mix with all the great, the honoured of the state."

1084,LXXIII.,"Till, like one man, ten thousand hands applaud,"
1085,LXXIII.,From the palpitating auditorium.
1086,LXXIII.,See from the boxes all the purses come!
1087,LXXIII.,How riveted admirers pause aghast!
1088,LXXIII.,Hear the excitement in the stifled hum!
1089,LXXIII.,And see the tears of each enthusiast!
1090,LXXIII.,Look! ere the actor has before the curtain passed.
1091,LXXIII.,
1092,LXXIII.,
1093,LXXIV.,LXXIV.
1094,LXXIV.,
1095,LXXIV.,Turn on the lights! Let the besweated crowds
1096,LXXIV.,"Shriek as the music swells, now high, now low"
1097,LXXIV.,For all to-morrow slumber in their shrouds
1098,LXXIV.,Who drained excitement's cup an hour ago!
1099,LXXIV.,"Watch flitting beauty, nymph-like, come and go,"
1100,LXXIV.,"Fan the scorched cheek and quaff the bright champagne,"
1101,LXXIV.,"Around the circles see the diamond-glow,"
1102,LXXIV.,"Revel in laughter, think no more of pain!"

1107,LXXV.,
1108,LXXV.,"Put up the opera-glass and scan the stage,"
1109,LXXV.,"On crimson piles luxuriantly recline,"
1110,LXXV.,And see the premature decay of age
1111,LXXV.,"Transformed to youth, a lovely columbine!"
1112,LXXV.,While th' gorgeous tapestries of rare design
1113,LXXV.,In rich profusion hang in heavy fold;
1114,LXXV.,See every pantomimic splendour shine
1115,LXXV.,"Like glist'ring starlight, opal, pearl, and gold,"

1117,LXXV.,
1118,LXXV.,
1119,LXXVI.,LXXVI.
1120,LXXVI.,
1121,LXXVI.,"But some folks always spend the night in gaming,"
1122,LXXVI.,"Or very nearly so, at any rate,"
1123,LXXVI.,And other vices hardly worth the naming
1124,LXXVI.,"(But we, of course, are not immaculate),"
1125,LXXVI.,"Then think of rising very, very late"
1126,LXXVI.,After a night's debauch and dissipation
1127,LXXVI.,And rolling homewards with unsteady gait
1128,LXXVI.,(Perhaps 'twas after the red-hot gyration
1129,LXXVI.,Of the previous evening). Ours is a sad nation!

1134,LXXVII.,"The breakfast lies untasted, for the tea"
1135,LXXVII.,Is not the nectar-like concoction (such
1136,LXXVII.,As accompanies the dice and play-room) we
1137,LXXVII.,"Are very fond of (for we take too much),"
1138,LXXVII.,And therefore home supplies we cannot touch;
1139,LXXVII.,"In all and everything we are undone,"
1140,LXXVII.,"Lips parch, head whirls, was never such"
1141,LXXVII.,A wretched plight; indeed we're not A 1.

1146,LXXVIII.,
1147,LXXVIII.,But 'tis too bad I know;--again I've erred

1149,LXXVIII.,"I'm sorry that it should have thus occurred,"
1150,LXXVIII.,"I know, and you know too, that I am frail"
1151,LXXVIII.,"And everything I've said is very stale,"

1153,LXXVIII.,"To some of you on p'raps a different scale,"
1154,LXXVIII.,"Much more familiar, if one only knew."

1160,LXXIX.,The day arrived; the sun was shining brightly

1162,LXXIX.,The rooms were swept and all that was unsightly
1163,LXXIX.,They hid away as quickly as they could;
1164,LXXIX.,"And then the edibles, both many and good,"
1165,LXXIX.,Julia and Hannah carried to the spot
1166,LXXIX.,(The nearest way was through the primrose-wood)
1167,LXXIX.,"And then turned homeward with a merry trot,"

1189,LXXXI.,The question was--where did their bounty cease?
1190,LXXXI.,"So fast their acts of kindness did increase,"
1191,LXXXI.,So welcome were they to the neighb'ring poor
1192,LXXXI.,"To whom their homely smile was joy and peace,"
1193,LXXXI.,And to whose cottages they often bore
1194,LXXXI.,Some small addition to their little cupboard store.

1309,XC.,(To which it is but justice to refer)
1310,XC.,Than her sweet smile nought could have been much prettier.

1312,XC.,
1313,XCI.,XCI.
1314,XCI.,
1315,XCI.,From three crossed sticks above a faggot fire
1316,XCI.,The water-vessel sent they did suspend
1317,XCI.,"As people mostly do, with twisted wire;"
1318,XCI.,"Much care and labour too they did expend,"
1319,XCI.,Determined that their visitors should spend
1320,XCI.,"A very merry evening, which they had,"
1321,XCI.,"For there was merry-making without end,"
1322,XCI.,And all the company made very glad;
1323,XCI.,"Considering all things, its success was not so bad."
1324,XCI.,
1325,XCI.,
1326,XCII.,XCII.
1327,XCII.,
1328,XCII.,The host was irresistibly polite;
1329,XCII.,"""Now _do_ try this"" he pressingly would say,"
1330,XCII.,Until it was a positive delight
1331,XCII.,To pass your plate and let him have his way;
1332,XCII.,"Indeed he scorned the very thought of ""Nay;"""
1333,XCII.,"The ladies, though they chatted gaily, thought"
1334,XCII.,"Of lots and lots of things they'd like to say,"
1335,XCII.,"But couldn't then, you know, for they'd been taught"
1336,XCII.,At such a time to smother feelings of the sort.
1337,XCII.,
1338,XCII.,
1339,XCIII.,XCIII.
1340,XCIII.,
1341,XCIII.,"Pop went the corks, the ladies screamed with fear"
1342,XCIII.,"And put their handkerchiefs before their face,"
1343,XCIII.,Then stuffed their ears so full they couldn't hear
1344,XCIII.,"And each one made a terrible grimace,"
1345,XCIII.,Begging that to some farther distant place
1346,XCIII.,"The bottles should be pointed; then, alas!"
1347,XCIII.,"All ran away as though they ran a race,"
1348,XCIII.,When each had managed to upset her glass
1349,XCIII.,"On the corks banging, like a timid little (l)ass."
1350,XCIII.,
1351,XCIII.,
1352,XCIV.,XCIV.
1353,XCIV.,
1354,XCIV.,"The ladies then, with one consent, declared"
1355,XCIV.,"The gentlemen to be too good by half,"
1356,XCIV.,That angels with them could not be compared;
1357,XCIV.,Then everybody had a hearty laugh;
1358,XCIV.,"The ""charms"" indulged in various little chaff"
1359,XCIV.,"And gave the gentlemen some dreadful ""whacks,"""
1360,XCIV.,I do not mean with their Papa's old staff
1361,XCIV.,"But with their little hands, across their backs,"
1362,XCIV.,Observing they deserved quite twice as many smacks.
1363,XCIV.,
1364,XCIV.,
1365,XCV.,XCV.
1366,XCV.,
1367,XCV.,"Rowland, our handsome friend, pronounced the pies"
1368,XCV.,Of all he ever liked to be the best;
1369,XCV.,"Lionel, too, bespoke the strawberries,"
1370,XCV.,"And Gilbert loved the currants, he confessed;"
1371,XCV.,"In short, the gathering was the loveliest"
1372,XCV.,"Of all the gatherings they had ever known,"
1373,XCV.,"And each, of course, was proud to be a guest;"
1374,XCV.,The ladies sighed how fast the time had flown;
1375,XCV.,That they were sorry everybody there did own.
1376,XCV.,
1377,XCV.,
1378,XCVI.,XCVI.
1379,XCVI.,
1380,XCVI.,Then (at the special signal of Mamma)
1381,XCVI.,The labourers came to take some little cheer;
1382,XCVI.,"They doffed their hats and shouted thrice ""Hurrah!"""
1383,XCVI.,When they had polished off a little beer;
1384,XCVI.,"But took the treasure while a burning tear,"
1385,XCVI.,"Unchecked and gentle, trembled on the cheek"
1386,XCVI.,"And damped the furrows of full many a year,"
1387,XCVI.,"And fettered up the lips; thankful and meek,"
1388,XCVI.,"Each rustic bent his toil-worn brow, but could not speak."
1389,XCVI.,
1390,XCVI.,
1391,XCVII.,XCVII.
1392,XCVII.,
1393,XCVII.,And each one passed his rough and heavy sleeve
1394,XCVII.,"Up to his face, across his briny eye;"
1395,XCVII.,What human breast that tears may not relieve?
1396,XCVII.,What cheek that tears can never beautify?
1397,XCVII.,They moved away and sauntered leisurely
1398,XCVII.,"Back to their toil, back to their daily bread,"
1399,XCVII.,Then homewards. In the evening's streaky sky
1400,XCVII.,The crescent moon gleamed faintly overhead
1401,XCVII.,And whispered that their little ones were hushed in bed.
1402,XCVII.,
1403,XCVII.,
1404,XCVIII.,XCVIII.
1405,XCVIII.,
1406,XCVIII.,Our friends and visitors withdrew inside
1407,XCVIII.,"Now they had tossed the hay and had their fill,"
1408,XCVIII.,"And it was proper time they should, beside--"
1409,XCVIII.,The fields were getting positively chill;
1410,XCVIII.,The gentlemen sat down and rested till
1411,XCVIII.,"The trap was ready, and the lamps were lighted,"
1412,XCVIII.,"And pleased they were to chat awhile, but still"
1413,XCVIII.,It made the journey tedious if benighted;
1414,XCVIII.,Of course they mentioned they'd been thoroughly delighted.
1415,XCVIII.,
1416,XCVIII.,
1417,XCIX.,XCIX.
1418,XCIX.,
1419,XCIX.,"Then scribbling autographs seemed all the go,"
1420,XCIX.,"And music took the place of tossing hay,"
1421,XCIX.,"With various small etcetera, and so"
1422,XCIX.,It came about they should not go away
1423,XCIX.,Before they'd promised for another day.
1424,XCIX.,"Of course what could they say? they said they would,"
1425,XCIX.,And highly pleased they all were I daresay;
1426,XCIX.,And so between them all 'twas understood
1427,XCIX.,They had arranged a pic-nic near some distant wood.
1428,XCIX.,
1429,XCIX.,
1430,C.,C.
1431,C.,
1432,C.,"Meanwhile the horse was getting slightly frisky,"
1433,C.,Impatient quite to trot his homeward road;
1434,C.,"Of course our friends must have a glass of whisky,"
1435,C.,"The frisky horse, the trap, and all be blowed:"
1436,C.,As long as they arrived at their abode
1437,C.,"It didn't matter and they didn't care,"
1438,C.,And all these circumstances only showed
1439,C.,"They were in no great hurry to be there,"
1440,C.,Perhaps preferring to remain just where they were.
1441,C.,
1442,C.,
1443,CI.,CI.
1444,CI.,
1445,CI.,"But still the parting came: as for adieus,"
1446,CI.,"They lasted just as long, I do believe,"
1447,CI.,"As all the ""Hows"" and ""Whens"" and ""How d'ye dos"""
1448,CI.,"On their arrival,--no, I don't deceive;"
1449,CI.,"They all took ""quite excruciating"" leave,"
1450,CI.,"And Julia hurried up and held the gate,"
1451,CI.,"For which a florin-piece she did receive,"
1452,CI.,"Then hurried back in quite a frantic state,"
1453,CI.,Indeed her eyes with very pleasure did dilate.
1454,CI.,
1455,CI.,
1456,CII.,CII.
1457,CII.,
1458,CII.,"Now they were all alone, the day was o'er,"
1459,CII.,"The blinds were down and all the shutters closed,"
1460,CII.,"Julia was sent to bolt the garden door,"
1461,CII.,And all did whatsoe'er they felt disposed;
1462,CII.,"Mamma, with covered face, lay down and dozed,"
1463,CII.,"Papa and his three daughters played at loo,"
1464,CII.,"It was a pleasant pastime they supposed,"
1465,CII.,"I almost think it must have been, don't you?"
1466,CII.,But everybody wished the day would dawn anew.
1467,CII.,
1468,CII.,
1469,CIII.,CIII.
1470,CIII.,
1471,CIII.,"They went to bed, as weary people must,"
1472,CIII.,"Earlier than usual, after having played"
1473,CIII.,"Three lovely games at loo, and then discussed"
1474,CIII.,The nice refreshment in the pleasant shade;
1475,CIII.,And I am sure they must have been repaid
1476,CIII.,Quite amply for their trouble in the pleasure
1477,CIII.,"Of hearing all the gentlemen had said,"
1478,CIII.,For Dora seemed amused beyond all measure--
1479,CIII.,"(She was the eldest one, you know, and such a treasure!)"
1480,CIII.,

1482,CIV.,CIV.
1483,CIV.,
1484,CIV.,"The household said good night to chat and cards,"
1485,CIV.,"They were, at least they seemed to be, worn out;"
1486,CIV.,"And 'tis the same, I think, with tiny bards,"
1487,CIV.,"For they, too, must leave off sometimes, no doubt,"
1488,CIV.,"Most folks, I know, would rather be without"
1489,CIV.,"Such nuisances as we are at the most,"
1490,CIV.,"And I myself am but a lazy lout,"
1491,CIV.,For dallying all my time amongst the host
1492,CIV.,Of scribbling dolts; but writing verse is not my boast.

1497,CV.,"Good-bye, my friends, for now, I really think,"

1499,CV.,"To lay aside my paper, pen and ink,"
1500,CV.,"And hush the grating measure of my song,"
1501,CV.,"Your kind applause may not to me belong,"
1502,CV.,"It might have been much better I'll agree,"
1503,CV.,But if you'll just decide to come along--
1504,CV.,"With a forgiving heart--along with me,"
1505,CV.,We'll both shake hands upon the subject merrily.

1510,CVI.,"It is a pity fools are prone to scribble,"

1513,CVI.,All down their literary pinafores.
1514,CVI.,"All men form two divisions--first, the Bores,"

1526,CVII.,Floating in air like things ethereal;
1527,CVII.,How dare such stupid things intrude at all!
1528,CVII.,"There, let me sleep for Goodness' Gracious' sake,"
1529,CVII.,"I really shall not answer if you call,"

1546,I.,"Good day, and how d'ye do my friends and neighbours?"
1547,I.,I must have dozed upon my easy chair;
1548,I.,"I feel refreshed and recommence my labours,"
1549,I.,"And urge my soaring Pegasus through air,"
1550,I.,"Nor ask his destination or his fare,"
1551,I.,"It matters not to me, and I resume;"
1552,I.,"But not to dose you more than you can bear,"
1553,I.,"To take my flight with others, I presume,"
1554,I.,"And why not so, my friends, since there's no lack of room?"
1555,I.,
1556,I.,
1557,II.,II.
1558,II.,
1559,II.,You know I am a careless sort of fellow
1560,II.,"On whom no living being spends a wink,"
1561,II.,"So stand aside and let me have my bellow,"
1562,II.,You surely will not grudge me pen and ink!
1563,II.,I've little doubt that if you stop to think
1564,II.,"You'll recollect I've met you once before,"
1565,II.,I'm not the humbug who would wish to shrink
1566,II.,"From friends of old, and so let's have your paw;"

1572,III.,"You know my failing and you will forgive it,"

1574,III.,"Yet, as with most objections, you'll outlive it"
1575,III.,Before the lapse of very many days;
1576,III.,"The fact is this, I never look for praise"
1577,III.,"And never want it, for I quite intend"
1578,III.,"To abandon rhyming and amend my ways,"
1579,III.,And utilise the moments that I spend
1580,III.,"In such-like nonsense, towards a more befitting end."

1583,IV.,IV.
1584,IV.,
1585,IV.,"I have my likes, great likes, great dislikes too,"
1586,IV.,'Twere well did I just one or two rehearse;
1587,IV.,"I hate to see a fool his ways renew,"
1588,IV.,I hate to see a youngster scribbling verse;
1589,IV.,"And now, my friends, just think, what can be worse"
1590,IV.,Than wasting time when we've so little of it?
1591,IV.,"But waywardness will surely prove a curse,"
1592,IV.,"They tell me that I ought to be above it,"

1595,IV.,
1596,V.,V.
1597,V.,
1598,V.,"But something strange impels me to the task,"
1599,V.,And here am I complaining while I write
1600,V.,Of human nature. Of myself I ask--
1601,V.,Now am I doing wrong or doing right?
1602,V.,'Tis hard indeed (I find it so) to fight
1603,V.,"(However perseveringly I try,"
1604,V.,And more particularly so to-night)
1605,V.,Against this most uncouth propensity:
1606,V.,Most likely tho' I shall grow wiser by and bye.
1607,V.,

1609,VI.,VI.
1610,VI.,
1611,VI.,But I'll proceed--I never see the use
1612,VI.,"Of giving up a task when once begun,"
1613,VI.,"Besides it's nonsense urging an excuse,"
1614,VI.,Just let me end my tale and I am done.
1615,VI.,"Why, there's the breakfast bell, and, ten to one,"
1616,VI.,"Those girls are fast asleep, and what d'ye bet?"
1617,VI.,"And Julia's just been waking them, what fun!"
1618,VI.,"Ah, very well, you've lost, and don't forget"

1621,VI.,
1622,VII.,VII.
1623,VII.,
1624,VII.,The girls were late indeed and no mistake;
1625,VII.,"Unutterably tired I should say,"
1626,VII.,"But Julia said they all were wide awake,"
1627,VII.,And so 'twas useless making more delay.
1628,VII.,Mamma proceeded in her usual way
1629,VII.,"To order in the breakfast then and there,"
1630,VII.,"Concluding 'twas the excitement yesterday,"
1631,VII.,For waiting long was more than she could bear;
1632,VII.,So after having kissed papa she took her chair.
1633,VII.,
1634,VII.,
1635,VIII.,VIII.
1636,VIII.,
1637,VIII.,Papa consulted the barometer
1638,VIII.,"To gain some knowledge of the coming weather,"
1639,VIII.,"Then stared and took out his chronometer,"
1640,VIII.,Remarking it was funny altogether;
1641,VIII.,He rang the bell in order to know whether
1642,VIII.,"His daughters really had begun to dress,"
1643,VIII.,"And Julia, quite as light as any feather,"
1644,VIII.,"Swept in and pertly answered, ""Yes, Sir, yes,"""
1645,VIII.,"Much to his satisfaction, doubtless, you may guess."
1646,VIII.,
1647,VIII.,
1648,IX.,IX.
1649,IX.,
1650,IX.,"They all came down to find the breakfast cold,"
1651,IX.,"And there was then and there a great ""to-do,"""
1652,IX.,"Mamma felt very much disposed to scold,"
1653,IX.,"And answered their excuses with ""pooh-pooh:"""
1654,IX.,"I think 'twas rather too bad tho', don't you,"
1655,IX.,Since they had done the very best they could
1656,IX.,To entertain their visitors all through?
1657,IX.,"But there! she only scolded for their good,"
1658,IX.,And 'twas not well for them o'er such-like things to brood.
1659,IX.,
1660,IX.,
1661,X.,X.
1662,X.,
1663,X.,"For several days they were not quite the thing,"
1664,X.,To judge from all appearances at least;
1665,X.,"Their youthful levity had taken wing,"
1666,X.,And all excursions for the present ceased;
1667,X.,"And momently their restlessness increased,"
1668,X.,The sketch was left unheeded: incomplete
1669,X.,"The slippers they were knitting ere the feast,"
1670,X.,"And faded garlands strewed the arbour seat,"
1671,X.,Now silent and neglected was that cool retreat.
1672,X.,
1673,X.,
1674,XI.,XI.
1675,XI.,
1676,XI.,But still this feeling's always more or less
1677,XI.,"Shortlived, I find it so, at any rate,"
1678,XI.,"Altho' not always easy to repress,"
1679,XI.,We very soon reclaim our normal state:
1680,XI.,"'Twas so in this case, happy to relate,"
1681,XI.,"For soon they all were lark-like as before,"
1682,XI.,"With all their usual buoyancy innate,"
1683,XI.,Indeed they took to frolic more and more;
1684,XI.,They were the liveliest feminines one ever saw.
1685,XI.,
1686,XI.,
1687,XII.,XII.
1688,XII.,
1689,XII.,"It somehow chanced one night they could not sleep,"
1690,XII.,"They did not even doze, but wakeful lay;"
1691,XII.,Oblivion's mists their senses did not steep;
1692,XII.,Whatever was the cause I cannot say;
1693,XII.,"So they commenced to chat the time away,"
1694,XII.,"Their rooms were quite convenient for it too,"
1695,XII.,"Then on to various topics did they stray,"
1696,XII.,And long forgotten converse did renew:
1697,XII.,"No doubt 'twas quite enjoyable, they thought so too."
1698,XII.,
1699,XII.,
1700,XIII.,XIII.
1701,XIII.,
1702,XIII.,"At last, of course, they didn't wish to doze,"
1703,XIII.,Preferring to prolong the conversation;
1704,XIII.,And still suggestions one by one arose
1705,XIII.,Which only met with their disapprobation;
1706,XIII.,And jokes were cracked in lively alternation:
1707,XIII.,"From sundry rappings ""peal on peal afar"""
1708,XIII.,Occasioning surprise and consternation
1709,XIII.,"I'm half afraid that they awoke Mama,"
1710,XIII.,"And, dozing sweetly too, most likely their papa."
1711,XIII.,
1712,XIII.,
1713,XIV.,XIV.
1714,XIV.,
1715,XIV.,"This was effectual to some extent,"
1716,XIV.,They brought their voices down to somewhat low.
1717,XIV.,"T' arouse the slumb'ring folks they never meant,"
1718,XIV.,Whom they'd disturbed so much a while ago;
1719,XIV.,So they arranged at once that both should go
1720,XIV.,"To Dora's bedroom if they wished to speak,"
1721,XIV.,"And ""trip it on the light fantastic toe,"""
1722,XIV.,"But, oh dear, how those stupid boards did creak"
1723,XIV.,As both of them their darling sister's room did seek!
1724,XIV.,
1725,XIV.,
1726,XV.,XV.
1727,XV.,
1728,XV.,The lamp was lighted and the apparatus
1729,XV.,"For making coffee speedily prepared,"
1730,XV.,"The cups were steaming with an _odor gratus_,"
1731,XV.,They thought not of the hour and little cared
1732,XV.,"How far advanced the night, and gaily fared"
1733,XV.,"On Spanish rusks and coffee, whilst the cry"
1734,XV.,"Of cockerel answered cockerel, and they shared"
1735,XV.,"The bountiful repast delightedly,"
1736,XV.,And chatted over several matters merrily.
1737,XV.,
1738,XV.,
1739,XVI.,XVI.
1740,XVI.,
1741,XVI.,"With _robe de chambre_ and slippers, each one seemed"
1742,XVI.,"To be exactly in her element,"
1743,XVI.,"While from each dimpled cheek a beauty beamed,"
1744,XVI.,"A rosy flush, of blossoms redolent;"
1745,XVI.,Moreover each one's _deshabille_ had lent
1746,XVI.,"A careless grace which numbers can't convey,"
1747,XVI.,As tho' fair Venus all her arts had spent
1748,XVI.,"In rendering them beautiful as day,"
1749,XVI.,Or had transformed each fondling to a fairy-fay.
1750,XVI.,
1751,XVI.,
1752,XVII.,XVII.
1753,XVII.,
1754,XVII.,"And there they sweetly lounged _in statu quo_,"
1755,XVII.,"More beautiful than words can ever tell,"
1756,XVII.,In fact a tiny sprig of mistletoe
1757,XVII.,"I should have deemed quite indispensable,"
1758,XVII.,So greatly did their excellence excel
1759,XVII.,"All evanescent beauty in man's eyes,"
1760,XVII.,"The loveliest primrose in the greenest dell,"
1761,XVII.,The lithest form man e'er did idolize:
1762,XVII.,Fairer than fleece-like cloudlets of the southern skies.

1766,XVIII.,
1767,XVIII.,"Now Flora oped the casement, for she sought"
1768,XVIII.,The realm of silent Night. The breezes soft
1769,XVIII.,"Swept o'er her brow and cooled each burning thought,"
1770,XVIII.,And calmly bore each tranquil prayer aloft;
1771,XVIII.,She sniffed the balmy air and lightly quaffed
1772,XVIII.,"The faint and mellow perfumes as they came,"
1773,XVIII.,"And gazed abstractedly, as she so oft"
1774,XVIII.,"Had done before. Who would not do the same,"
1775,XVIII.,And fondly praise his Maker's most belovëd name?
1776,XVIII.,
1777,XVIII.,
1778,XIX.,XIX.
1779,XIX.,
1780,XIX.,"Below, the pebbly rill, like the fond sigh"
1781,XIX.,"Of maiden's love, was whispering to the night,"
1782,XIX.,"While on its breast the star-lit canopy,"
1783,XIX.,"Reflected clear, the bosom did invite"
1784,XIX.,"To share its holy peace, its still delight,"
1785,XIX.,"And join the drowsy nocturnes that arose,"
1786,XIX.,"Hushing all nature to a slumber light,"
1787,XIX.,And soothing down on pillows of repose
1788,XIX.,"All weary mortals' earthly turmoils, cares and woes."
1789,XIX.,
1790,XIX.,
1791,XX.,XX.
1792,XX.,
1793,XX.,"And summer dews had steeped the verdant sod,"
1794,XX.,"The moon-rays shimmered o'er the spangled lea,"
1795,XX.,"And taught the soul the eloquence of God,"
1796,XX.,Tinging the far horizon o'er the sea
1797,XX.,"With silver film and sheeny filigree,"
1798,XX.,While o'er the gray expanse with trembling wing
1799,XX.,"The ling'ring zephyr hovered sleepily,"
1800,XX.,And faintly breathed o'er every dormant thing
1801,XX.,"Its soft, sad benediction. This did Flora sing:--"
1802,XX.,
1803,XX.,"Oh Night, beneath thy dark domain"
1804,XX.,How oft the human heart has bled!
1805,XX.,"But here a holy peace doth reign,"
1806,XX.,And now my soul is comforted.
1807,XX.,
1808,XX.,"Sublimest Monarch, teach my breast"
1809,XX.,"To speak the phantasy it feels,"
1810,XX.,"O take my heart to be thy guest,"
1811,XX.,And stay thy sombre chariot-wheels!
1812,XX.,
1813,XX.,Thy course is bent thro' clouds--on them
1814,XX.,"Thy path thou takest o'er the sea,"
1815,XX.,"Ten myriad worlds thy diadem,"
1816,XX.,Oh take me to abide with thee!
1817,XX.,
1818,XX.,Thy sceptre--'tis with points of light
1819,XX.,"Begemmed; thy retinues advance,"
1820,XX.,"And feeble Nature owns thy might,"
1821,XX.,The splendour of thy countenance.
1822,XX.,
1823,XX.,"The moon thy lamp, the flaming sun"
1824,XX.,"Thy harbinger; take thou my soul,"
1825,XX.,"Now bounding forth thy race to run,"
1826,XX.,To thy Imperial Capitol!
1827,XX.,
1828,XX.,O let my spirit wander o'er
1829,XX.,"Thy sable woods and feel their sighs,"
1830,XX.,"And float upon thy Stygian shore,"
1831,XX.,And revel in its mysteries!
1832,XX.,
1833,XX.,"O but to mingle with thy throng,"
1834,XX.,"Partaker in thy flight to be,"
1835,XX.,"A portion of that spirit-song,"
1836,XX.,A spirit minister to thee!

1840,XXI.,
1841,XXI.,They soon were rather weary and methinks
1842,XXI.,"Their chirp-like chatter did grow somewhat less,"
1843,XXI.,"Now one would rouse herself from forty winks,"
1844,XXI.,Another doze in sweet unconsciousness;
1845,XXI.,"Indeed it was high time, as you may guess,"
1846,XXI.,"They should disperse--they wisely thought so too,"
1847,XXI.,Then kissed and smiled and each one did confess
1848,XXI.,"Such pranks as these would never, never do;"
1849,XXI.,"Of course they'd have to meet the scolding, that they knew."
1850,XXI.,
1851,XXI.,

1853,XXII.,
1854,XXII.,Their dreams were peopled with all forms and shapes
1855,XXII.,"That nightmare with its horrors can conceive,"
1856,XXII.,Egyptian sphynxes down to Barb'ry apes:
1857,XXII.,Entangled in all nets that dreams can weave
1858,XXII.,They struggled to get liberty and leave
1859,XXII.,"The meshy maze, yet struggled all in vain,"
1860,XXII.,Such horribles you never could believe
1861,XXII.,I wonder if they all transgressed again
1862,XXII.,As then; thus pleasure's always found preceding pain.

1864,XXII.,
1865,XXIII.,XXIII.
1866,XXIII.,
1867,XXIII.,"Rose, like the others, saw the wrong she did"
1868,XXIII.,"Personified in dreams, while on her chest,"
1869,XXIII.,"In slow descent, an Eastern Pyramid"
1870,XXIII.,"Came down to crush her flat, she did her best,"
1871,XXIII.,"Like dreaming people do when so distressed,"
1872,XXIII.,"To move from underneath the cruel thing,"
1873,XXIII.,When up came Ju to know if she were dressed
1874,XXIII.,"And if she heard the bell for breakfast ring,"
1875,XXIII.,Surprised indeed so late to find her slumbering.
1876,XXIII.,
1877,XXIII.,
1878,XXIV.,XXIV.
1879,XXIV.,
1880,XXIV.,"She heard it, yes, but with a dreaming ear,"
1881,XXIV.,Just as the pile above her did descend;
1882,XXIV.,"She heard the funeral knell, she saw the bier,"
1883,XXIV.,Which was to seal her most unpleasant end;
1884,XXIV.,But fortunately then Mama did send
1885,XXIV.,"The housemaid to inform the time of day,"
1886,XXIV.,"The Spinx etcetera did their ways amend,"
1887,XXIV.,"Politely bowed, took wing, and flew away;"
1888,XXIV.,Rose wished them all good morning with no more delay.
1889,XXIV.,
1890,XXIV.,
1891,XXV.,XXV.
1892,XXV.,
1893,XXV.,The girls went down to breakfast with a look
1894,XXV.,"Which spoke guilt, shame and terror all in one,"
1895,XXV.,Each sigh was language and each glance a book
1896,XXV.,Narrating all the mischief they had done;
1897,XXV.,And cowering conscience cautioned them to shun
1898,XXV.,"The searching lectures of parental eyes,"
1899,XXV.,"But still the dark ordeal had begin,"
1900,XXV.,"For Mama swelled to a terrific size,"
1901,XXV.,And Pater looked around the room in mute surprise.
1902,XXV.,
1903,XXV.,
1904,XXVI.,XXVI.
1905,XXVI.,
1906,XXVI.,"Then glances were exchanged, and both declared"
1907,XXVI.,"Such freaks as these again must never be,"
1908,XXVI.,"Their Ma demanded how they even dared,"
1909,XXVI.,"Since they'd been naughty to the last degree,"
1910,XXVI.,"Ejaculating faintly ""Goodness me!"""
1911,XXVI.,"With various interjections of alarm,"
1912,XXVI.,"Stamping with anger at the guilty three,"
1913,XXVI.,"But 'twas not long e'er she again was calm,"
1914,XXVI.,And all her daughters knew of course she meant no harm.
1915,XXVI.,
1916,XXVI.,
1917,XXVII.,XXVII.
1918,XXVII.,
1919,XXVII.,But this unhappy circumstance was soon--
1920,XXVII.,"Like such unpleasantnesses were--forgotten,"
1921,XXVII.,"All things were tolerably straight by noon,"
1922,XXVII.,(_For family disputes are hell-begotten_);
1923,XXVII.,"So they betook them to their knitting-cotton,"
1924,XXVII.,"And felt themselves forgiven, as they were,"
1925,XXVII.,"They said that lesson should be unforgotten,"
1926,XXVII.,"Such nonsense never should again occur,"
1927,XXVII.,So they had asked their parents' pardon I infer.
1928,XXVII.,
1929,XXVII.,
1930,XXVIII.,XXVIII.
1931,XXVIII.,
1932,XXVIII.,"Days had not only sped but galloped on,"
1933,XXVIII.,"As they expressed it, e'er they could ""turn round;"""
1934,XXVIII.,"Before they were aware, the month had gone,"
1935,XXVIII.,"The first of August, too, had come they found,"
1936,XXVIII.,(A fact which seemed the household to astound)
1937,XXVIII.,"On which date, I imagine, they designed"
1938,XXVIII.,"A short excursion, by the pleasant sound"
1939,XXVIII.,Of tossing waters wild and unconfined:
1940,XXVIII.,In following this suggestion they were not behind.
1941,XXVIII.,
1942,XXVIII.,
1943,XXIX.,XXIX.
1944,XXIX.,
1945,XXIX.,"It _was_ the first of August, now I know,"
1946,XXIX.,"A day that's most unlucky I believe,"
1947,XXIX.,"As I, for one, have always found it so,"
1948,XXIX.,Then ask Astrologers who can't deceive;
1949,XXIX.,"For I myself was surely doomed to grieve,"
1950,XXIX.,"Selected by some most ill-omened star,"
1951,XXIX.,"'Twas then (but why, I really can't conceive)"
1952,XXIX.,"That _I_ was introduced to _my_ Mama,"
1953,XXIX.,From then she always wished me over at Malabar.

1957,XXX.,
1958,XXX.,"I mean to say that I was born unlucky,"
1959,XXX.,"My mother never danced me up and down,"
1960,XXX.,"I never once was designated ""ducky,"""
1961,XXX.,"Nor rolled within the doubles of her gown,"
1962,XXX.,"Nor dandled as when fondlings ""go to town,"""
1963,XXX.,"Nor kissed and snuggled when I went to bed,"
1964,XXX.,"Or rather when conveyed there with a frown,"
1965,XXX.,A downright shaking and a smarting head;
1966,XXX.,To me no coaxing sweet appeal was made when fed.

1969,XXXI.,XXXI.
1970,XXXI.,
1971,XXXI.,I don't know if the Pythagorean theory
1972,XXXI.,"Is quite to be relied upon or spurned,"
1973,XXXI.,I'm half afraid this must remain a query
1974,XXXI.,As far as my enquiries are concerned;
1975,XXXI.,"For theories are by theories overturned,"
1976,XXXI.,"And what a wise man says a coon disputes,"
1977,XXXI.,"For my part I must leave it with the learned,"
1978,XXXI.,"And those who play the fool with such pursuits,"

1980,XXXI.,
1981,XXXI.,
1982,XXXII.,XXXII.
1983,XXXII.,
1984,XXXII.,But if that version of the matter's true
1985,XXXII.,"I must have suffered for my previous sin,"
1986,XXXII.,"Some former life of follies, what think you?"
1987,XXXII.,Some other mischief I've been joining in;
1988,XXXII.,But what's the use of idle pondering
1989,XXXII.,"On things so troublesome and as abstruse,"
1990,XXXII.,"It were prepost'rous even to begin,"
1991,XXXII.,What was there that could possibly induce
1992,XXXII.,Pythagoras to turn his pen to such a use?
1993,XXXII.,
1994,XXXII.,
1995,XXXIII.,XXXIII.
1996,XXXIII.,
1997,XXXIII.,The thought of spiritual transmigration
1998,XXXIII.,"Is somewhat pleasant, therefore let it be;"
1999,XXXIII.,It seems delightful to my contemplation
2000,XXXIII.,"But what of that, it's all the same to me!"
2001,XXXIII.,"In fact, to tell the truth, I cannot see"
2002,XXXIII.,Wherefore Pythagoras did puzzle o'er
2003,XXXIII.,This tiresome philosophy when he
2004,XXXIII.,"Must truly have considered it a bore,"

2049,XXXVII.,"They knocked, then pressed the latch and entered. There"

2051,XXXVII.,"Her cheek was bright, and fairer than the fair,"
2052,XXXVII.,Each tress the sungleam shimmering o'er the sea;
2053,XXXVII.,"An open bible lay upon her knee,"
2054,XXXVII.,She had been reading from the volume old
2055,XXXVII.,"In meek and innocent simplicity,"

2077,XXXIX.,Oh! what upon this weary earth so dear?
2078,XXXIX.,Oh! what so cherished as that smile below?
2079,XXXIX.,The depth of human fondness who can know?
2080,XXXIX.,"She dried her tears, imprinting a slow kiss"

2089,XL.,"Right down delighted that they should have come,"

2092,XL.,"She tried to make them cosy interdum,"
2093,XL.,"And to their kind enquiries she replied,"
2094,XL.,"""I'm bonny in my way, I thank you, Mum,"

2096,XL.,Then to them several little matters did confide.

2098,XL.,
2099,XLI.,XLI.
2100,XLI.,
2101,XLI.,"The cot, consisting of two rooms, was thatched;"
2102,XLI.,Each room was on the ground. Above the door
2103,XLI.,"Clung vines and roses, and the wall was patched,"
2104,XLI.,"And all an aspect of contentment bore,"
2105,XLI.,"The prettiest little scene you ever saw,"
2106,XLI.,"Within, above the mantel, hung the gun"
2107,XLI.,"Which there had hung for fifteen years or more,"
2108,XLI.,"Memento of that dear departed one,"
2109,XLI.,Telling of how much service it before had done.
2110,XLI.,
2111,XLI.,
2112,XLII.,XLII.
2113,XLII.,
2114,XLII.,Within the corner stood the eight-day clock
2115,XLII.,"Which had recounted time for years and years,"
2116,XLII.,"And even then was going ""tick-a-tock,"""
2117,XLII.,Tho' it had seen so many smiles and tears;
2118,XLII.,"There is a something which, I fancy, cheers"
2119,XLII.,"In the slow ditty which those songsters sing,"
2120,XLII.,"Some sweet responsion which the bosom hears,"
2121,XLII.,"Whose echo is so soft and comforting,"
2122,XLII.,Winding a stilly peace round each familiar thing.

2125,XLIII.,XLIII.
2126,XLIII.,
2127,XLIII.,"The bacon hung suspended from a beam,"
2128,XLIII.,And ancient china made the parlour gay;
2129,XLIII.,The picture of a little mountain stream
2130,XLIII.,Called Rose's admiration into play;
2131,XLIII.,"And, basking in the sun's delightful ray,"
2132,XLIII.,"A favourite kitten purred with sleepy air,"
2133,XLIII.,"The polished flags were spotless as the day,"
2134,XLIII.,"And groups of flowering plants stood here and there,"

2140,XLIV.,"Our ladies three had had their little chat,"
2141,XLIV.,"Had likewise done the good they had to do,"
2142,XLIV.,"Moreover had admired and stroked the cat,"
2143,XLIV.,And then they thought 'twas time that they withdrew;
2144,XLIV.,"The widow was more thankful than they knew,"
2145,XLIV.,And twenty times expressed her firm conviction
2146,XLIV.,They were disguised archangels (what think you?)
2147,XLIV.,"Then twenty times pronounced her benediction,"
2148,XLIV.,Hoping they'd never live to suffer _her_ affliction.

2152,XLV.,
2153,XLV.,"Her little grandchild courtesied at the gate,"
2154,XLV.,"Showed them the way and courtesied once again,"
2155,XLV.,They sauntered on at just their former rate
2156,XLV.,And chattered in their usual lively strain;
2157,XLV.,Passing along an elevated plain
2158,XLV.,They paused to look around them for the scene
2159,XLV.,Delighted them enormously and fain
2160,XLV.,"Would they have been to rest mid-way between,"
2161,XLV.,But forward gaily pressed o'er silent tracts of green.

2170,XLVI.,"How kind, how tranquil were thine hours to me,"
2171,XLVI.,"Those hours amongst thy silent valleys cast,"
2172,XLVI.,"O moments gone, come back and let me be"

2179,XLVII.,"Anon the summit of the cliff they gained,"

2182,XLVII.,With its fantastical embellishment;
2183,XLVII.,"The mind is riveted, the gaze is spent"
2184,XLVII.,"Where lavish Nature pours her richest spoil,"
2185,XLVII.,"The tongue is voiceless with bewilderment,"
2186,XLVII.,"Far, far below the ocean's ceaseless toil"

2192,XLVIII.,"Our little thoughts are staggered at the scene,"
2193,XLVIII.,"That splendour so unspeakably intense,"
2194,XLVIII.,"And dazzled by its brilliancy of sheen,"
2195,XLVIII.,The senses reel with its magnificence;
2196,XLVIII.,"Below the surgy yeast was boiling, whence"
2197,XLVIII.,"Rose on the summer air its restless roar,"
2198,XLVIII.,"It smote the broken cliff's bold battlements,"
2199,XLVIII.,"Unmoted like the warriors of yore,"

2204,XLIX.,
2205,XLIX.,"The feathery clouds moved slowly through the sky,"
2206,XLIX.,"The coast-line melted into tender blue,"
2207,XLIX.,The storm-bleared headland stood defiantly
2208,XLIX.,The boldest feature of that boundless view;
2209,XLIX.,"In contrast with its chalky front, the hue"
2210,XLIX.,"Of the green sea swept freely far and wide,"
2211,XLIX.,"And o'er the promontory's base there grew,"
2212,XLIX.,"As though its time-torn nakedness to hide,"
2213,XLIX.,Some shaggy weeds that floated on the swelling tide.

2218,L.,It was the ebb. They could not yet descend;
2219,L.,So Rose suggested that they should proceed
2220,L.,"In the direction of the headland's end,"
2221,L.,There straightway squat them on the grass and read
2222,L.,"The books they'd brought; to this they all agreed,"
2223,L.,"Then hastened onward though the sun was hot,"
2224,L.,And there beneath their sunshades with much speed
2225,L.,And very much more chatter did they squat;

2234,LI.,"Their baskets of refreshment for the day,"
2235,LI.,And laughed to see the paper fly away;
2236,LI.,"They must, I think, have quite enjoyed their fare"
2237,LI.,"So close above the music of the bay,"
2238,LI.,No doubt it was delightful to be there
2239,LI.,Fanned by the soothing breath of the ozonic air.
2240,LI.,
2241,LI.,
2242,LII.,LII.
2243,LII.,
2244,LII.,"They chatted, read, and dozed in alternation,"
2245,LII.,"And time had flitted as it always will,"
2246,LII.,"Flo recommended change of situation,"
2247,LII.,Not pleased that they were tarrying there still;
2248,LII.,So all arose and forward urged until
2249,LII.,"They saw afar some narrow steps and rude,"
2250,LII.,"Beginning some short distance up the hill,"
2251,LII.,And which of course no sooner had they viewed
2252,LII.,Than thither they repaired as quickly as they could.
2253,LII.,
2254,LII.,
2255,LIII.,LIII.
2256,LIII.,
2257,LIII.,"Descending, they discovered that the sea"
2258,LIII.,"Had much subsided since they saw it last,"
2259,LIII.,Then down they hopped with more than usual glee
2260,LIII.,To note the waters thus receding fast;
2261,LIII.,Upon the narrow strip of sand were cast
2262,LIII.,"Weeds, star-fish, and all sorts of shells around,"
2263,LIII.,"And, as along the level stretch they passed,"
2264,LIII.,Most interesting articles they found
2265,LIII.,Which lay all washed and wet upon the solid ground.
2266,LIII.,
2267,LIII.,
2268,LIV.,LIV.
2269,LIV.,
2270,LIV.,They cut their names upon the cliff and wrote
2271,LIV.,"All sorts of hieroglyphics on the sand,"
2272,LIV.,And rhymes that I'm unable now to quote;
2273,LIV.,All found amusement there on every hand;
2274,LIV.,They thought a life at sea was truly grand
2275,LIV.,"As very many ladies often do,"
2276,LIV.,"Perhaps it is when strolling on the strand,"
2277,LIV.,"At least I find it passable, don't you?"
2278,LIV.,"In fact, I think, much more so than _in transitu_."
2279,LIV.,
2280,LIV.,
2281,LV.,LV.
2282,LV.,
2283,LV.,They deemed it a misfortune they were girls;
2284,LV.,"Rose wished she'd been a boy and gone abroad,"
2285,LV.,Flo wished she'd been a sailor lad with curls
2286,LV.,By all the fair of Christendom adored;
2287,LV.,Then Dora too her present state deplored
2288,LV.,And also would have been a tar (because
2289,LV.,She loved to listen when the waters roared)
2290,LV.,Or any blessed thing but what she was;
2291,LV.,All these ideas were most enjoyable of course.
2292,LV.,
2293,LV.,
2294,LVI.,LVI.
2295,LVI.,
2296,LVI.,"At some short distance was a vessel hurled,"
2297,LVI.,"A dismal wreck, upon the rockbound shoal,"
2298,LVI.,"Around its hulk th' encircling billows curled,"
2299,LVI.,"Now thro' its splintered deck the wavelet stole,"
2300,LVI.,"Then, issuing forth, it gurgled through a hole"
2301,LVI.,"Staved by the tempest's fury in its side,"
2302,LVI.,"Afar off did its shattered timbers roll,"
2303,LVI.,Its treasures all were scattered in the tide.
2304,LVI.,"The headland gained, the swaying wreck they soon espied."
2305,LVI.,
2306,LVI.,
2307,LVII.,LVII.
2308,LVII.,
2309,LVII.,Soon as the waves permitted them to go
2310,LVII.,"Across the smooth white rocks, they to it went;"
2311,LVII.,"The raging brine had torn off half the bow,"
2312,LVII.,Its starboard shivered and its cordage rent;
2313,LVII.,The warring waters had their anger spent
2314,LVII.,"And flung its fragments to the cruel blast,"
2315,LVII.,"Its iron bands were burst apart and bent,"
2316,LVII.,And all around in dire disorder cast;
2317,LVII.,"There, shattered, at some little distance, lay the mast."
2318,LVII.,
2319,LVII.,
2320,LVIII.,LVIII.
2321,LVIII.,
2322,LVIII.,When gazing pensively o'er ocean's realm
2323,LVIII.,"Its wide destruction, its unspoken might,"
2324,LVIII.,"There is a something which doth overwhelm,"
2325,LVIII.,As day is overshadowed by the night;
2326,LVIII.,"This was, forsooth, an interesting sight"
2327,LVIII.,"To them, yet no less dreadful, for the scene"
2328,LVIII.,"Was one such as could never yield delight,"
2329,LVIII.,"And so delighted they could not have been,"
2330,LVIII.,Before they never such a spectacle had seen.
2331,LVIII.,
2332,LVIII.,
2333,LIX.,LIX.
2334,LIX.,
2335,LIX.,"They picked up curious items, three or four,"
2336,LIX.,"And placed them in their baskets to take home,"
2337,LIX.,"The wreck and its surroundings did explore,"
2338,LIX.,"Upon the slimy reefs, too, did they roam,"
2339,LIX.,"While backward and still backward rolled the foam,"
2340,LIX.,"While faster flew each hour, one after one,"
2341,LIX.,"And they discovered evening had come,"
2342,LIX.,"'Twas time they put an end to all their fun,"
2343,LIX.,And so to think of their return they had begun.

2347,LX.,
2348,LX.,"The time indeed had gone exceeding fast,"
2349,LX.,"But _how_ it had gone--_that_ they could not say,"
2350,LX.,"And nor could I, my reader, if you asked,"
2351,LX.,They tell me that for no man Time will stay:
2352,LX.,Oh! not for womankind--for such as they?
2353,LX.,I'm half afraid old Chronos doth forget
2354,LX.,As he goes tearing on from day to day
2355,LX.,The right and just demands of etiquette
2356,LX.,"Which is, as you'll agree, a matter of regret."
2357,LX.,
2358,LX.,
2359,LXI.,LXI.
2360,LXI.,
2361,LXI.,They finished their refreshments seated nicely
2362,LXI.,"Upon a spar (just what they all required),"
2363,LXI.,Which seemed as if put _for_ them--so precisely
2364,LXI.,Was it the very thing that they desired;
2365,LXI.,"They were (or should have been) intensely tired,"
2366,LXI.,"But luckily they had not far to go,"
2367,LXI.,"A lot of pleasant matters had transpired,"
2368,LXI.,And all had cracked their lively joke or so;
2369,LXI.,"But now the day was o'er, the sun was getting low."

2372,LXII.,LXII.
2373,LXII.,
2374,LXII.,"Behind the cliff they wished to see him fall,"
2375,LXII.,"And therefore with that object did they wait,"
2376,LXII.,"There was no need to hurry home at all,"
2377,LXII.,"And they could walk it well by half-past eight,"
2378,LXII.,And surely that was not so very late.
2379,LXII.,"They each detached a portion of the wood,"
2380,LXII.,"For Dora took much pains to demonstrate,"
2381,LXII.,It was most necessary that they should
2382,LXII.,(For a memento be it clearly understood).

2386,LXIII.,
2387,LXIII.,There can be nothing dearer that I know
2388,LXIII.,(When thus I speak of course I mean--_to me_)
2389,LXIII.,"Than wand'ring slowly when the tide is low,"
2390,LXIII.,Alone and silent by the gentle sea;
2391,LXIII.,Each winding cranny of the rock may be
2392,LXIII.,"Enjoyment's wealth. There, is a world of thought,"
2393,LXIII.,"Of joys unbounded for a heart as free,"
2394,LXIII.,A universe of life if only sought;
2395,LXIII.,"Each breath, each dreaming ripple is with music fraught."

2404,LXIV.,"There let me but my lonely footsteps guide,"
2405,LXIV.,"Or hasten to some far neglected glen,"
2406,LXIV.,"Wherein myself for ever I can hide,"
2407,LXIV.,"And rest a stranger to the ways of men,"

2416,LXV.,"And spend in solitude life's little day,"
2417,LXV.,"Where strange, strange voices all--all pass away"

2419,LXV.,"There in those stilly valleys let me stray,"

2425,LXVI.,
2426,LXVI.,"Within me is a craving, and for what?"
2427,LXVI.,"A lingering longing, dark and ill-defined,"
2428,LXVI.,"A something wanting, but I know it not,"
2429,LXVI.,"A missing link it is not mine to find,"
2430,LXVI.,A flaming fire that scorches up the mind
2431,LXVI.,And goads me ever onward--onward where?
2432,LXVI.,"I pray--I gasp for light--for I am blind,"
2433,LXVI.,"The light that never, never will be there;"

2443,LXVII.,"Give me the wood, the ocean, and the night,"
2444,LXVII.,"I ask no more, these, these shall be my all,"
2445,LXVII.,And wield my cornucopia of delight;

2452,LXVIII.,"I ask not Wealth, nor wish one single hour"
2453,LXVIII.,"Where Splendour gilds the trophies of the brave,"
2454,LXVIII.,"Of purse-proud pomp, of pageantry and power"
2455,LXVIII.,Whose flaunting grandeur can but deck the grave;
2456,LXVIII.,To me 'tis hollow--all is nothing save
2457,LXVIII.,"The pine-capped mountain and the heathery plain,"
2458,LXVIII.,"The rolling forest and the leaping wave,"

2464,LXIX.,
2465,LXIX.,Far have I wandered when the even fills
2466,LXIX.,"The bosom with sweet sadnesses and sighs,"
2467,LXIX.,When life was like the mellow on far hills
2468,LXIX.,Bathed in the sunset of the summer skies
2469,LXIX.,And tinged with purple--when the spirit cries
2470,LXIX.,"And gasps for very language but in vain,"
2471,LXIX.,"When wavelets whisper and the heart replies,"
2472,LXIX.,When the soul sobs and all is hushed again

2483,LXX.,The creatures of the air to home and rest

2494,LXXI.,With the departure of the solar ray;
2495,LXXI.,Do we not note this every dawning day--
2496,LXXI.,That beauty is short-lived and soon must pass?
2497,LXXI.,"More beautiful, more wasted by decay,"

2546,LXXV.,Where varied tints the landscape beautify;
2547,LXXV.,"It is the smirking maiden's nut-brown eye,"

2571,THE CHORUS OF THE NEREIDES.,"And we dance within its grottoes with an ever-whirling motion,"
2572,THE CHORUS OF THE NEREIDES.,And we roll the little wavelets one by one upon the shore.

2574,THE CHORUS OF THE NEREIDES.,"From beneath the leaves in caverns adamantine we are peeping,"
2575,THE CHORUS OF THE NEREIDES.,"Now along the blazing pearl and ruby corridors we glide,"

2590,LXXVII.,Fatigued by all their rambles on the coast;
2591,LXXVII.,"In clambering o'er the rocks no time they lost,"
2592,LXXVII.,"Altho' their small bottines got somewhat wet,"
2593,LXXVII.,"And their incautiousness some duckings cost,"

2603,LXXVIII.,She slipped and fell ere either could have caught her;
2604,LXXVIII.,"Her sisters shrieked and, bending, they besought her,"
2605,LXXVIII.,"To say if any hurt she had sustained,"
2606,LXXVIII.,"And Flora, much alarmed, at once bethought her"

2616,LXXIX.,"And seemed unable, tho' she strove, to speak:"
2617,LXXIX.,"Upon her forehead gaped a crimson streak,"
2618,LXXIX.,"And stretched upon th' unyielding rock she lay,"
2619,LXXIX.,"To soothe her pain both sisterlike did seek,"
2620,LXXIX.,They washed the bloody finger-prints away;

2643,LXXXI.,"Their inward terror could not be conceived,"

2669,LXXXIII.,"At the sad news he hastened to his door,"
2670,LXXXIII.,"Brought forth a lighted lantern and a phial,"
2671,LXXXIII.,"And both strode quickly forward to the shore,"
2672,LXXXIII.,"He tried to soothe poor Rose's grief the while,"
2673,LXXXIII.,Whose agitation told how terrible the trial.
2674,LXXXIII.,
2675,LXXXIII.,
2676,LXXXIV.,LXXXIV.
2677,LXXXIV.,
2678,LXXXIV.,"They reached the cliff and cautious did descend,"
2679,LXXXIV.,"They indistinctly saw a group of three,"
2680,LXXXIV.,In Rose's breast alarm and joy did blend
2681,LXXXIV.,While wondering who the welcome third might be;
2682,LXXXIV.,"Impatiently she hurried on to see,"
2683,LXXXIV.,'Twas Rowland kneeling at her sister's side
2684,LXXXIV.,To whom he ministered relief for he
2685,LXXXIV.,"The waving kerchief from the cliff had spied,"
2686,LXXXIV.,Had heard the call for help and to the beach had hied.
2687,LXXXIV.,
2688,LXXXIV.,
2689,LXXXV.,LXXXV.
2690,LXXXV.,
2691,LXXXV.,His brother Gilbert by some happy chance
2692,LXXXV.,"Had accompanied his brother on his way,"
2693,LXXXV.,Both saw what was the matter at a glance
2694,LXXXV.,As Dora on the ground unconscious lay;
2695,LXXXV.,Flora with tears besought them both to stay
2696,LXXXV.,But they'd arranged that Gilbert home should fly
2697,LXXXV.,(They lived three-quarters of a mile away)
2698,LXXXV.,"And bring restoratives immediately,"
2699,LXXXV.,"And chaise, of course, which was a great necessity."
2700,LXXXV.,
2701,LXXXV.,
2702,LXXXVI.,LXXXVI.
2703,LXXXVI.,
2704,LXXXVI.,"Now Dora upright sat and looked around,"
2705,LXXXVI.,"Much better than she was a time ago,"
2706,LXXXVI.,"With a damp handkerchief her head was bound,"
2707,LXXXVI.,And now and then she took a draught or so
2708,LXXXVI.,"The cottager supplied, as you all know,"
2709,LXXXVI.,Till on the road above the chaise arrived;
2710,LXXXVI.,"Gilbert his brother called from down below,"
2711,LXXXVI.,Gave him the flask and asked if she'd revived
2712,LXXXVI.,And how her safe removal was to be contrived.
2713,LXXXVI.,
2714,LXXXVI.,
2715,LXXXVII.,LXXXVII.
2716,LXXXVII.,
2717,LXXXVII.,There Gilbert waited while his brother went
2718,LXXXVII.,To offer his support to Dora who
2719,LXXXVII.,"Seemed nothing else but sweet bewilderment,"
2720,LXXXVII.,"And, at this juncture, so did Rowland too."
2721,LXXXVII.,"Since Gilbert brought one, they had lanterns two"
2722,LXXXVII.,"Which much assisted them their way to see,"
2723,LXXXVII.,As well as what they were about to do
2724,LXXXVII.,In this unfortunate emergency;
2725,LXXXVII.,For 'twas a matter of the utmost urgency.
2726,LXXXVII.,
2727,LXXXVII.,
2728,LXXXVIII.,LXXXVIII.
2729,LXXXVIII.,
2730,LXXXVIII.,"Now Rowland on the left supported Dora,"
2731,LXXXVIII.,"The cottager was stationed on the right,"
2732,LXXXVIII.,"One of the lights did they entrust to Flora,"
2733,LXXXVIII.,And one to Rose who was exhausted quite;
2734,LXXXVIII.,"Then on they passed beneath the sultry night,"
2735,LXXXVIII.,"Safe o'er the rocks, upon the hardened sand--"
2736,LXXXVIII.,Tho' Dora was in most unhappy plight--
2737,LXXXVIII.,"With all the haste they could just then command,"
2738,LXXXVIII.,Befitted to the circumstance you understand.
2739,LXXXVIII.,
2740,LXXXVIII.,
2741,LXXXIX.,LXXXIX.
2742,LXXXIX.,
2743,LXXXIX.,"The steps were steep and narrow, and a rail,"
2744,LXXXIX.,"For wanderers' protection was placed there,"
2745,LXXXIX.,Yet it was at the best so very frail
2746,LXXXIX.,That it was necessary to beware;
2747,LXXXIX.,"With narrow limits they did not despair,"
2748,LXXXIX.,But managed somehow to go three abreast
2749,LXXXIX.,And at the summit safely lodge their care;
2750,LXXXIX.,"To render her relief all did their best,"
2751,LXXXIX.,They knew their parents would be very much distressed.
2752,LXXXIX.,
2753,LXXXIX.,
2754,XC.,XC.
2755,XC.,
2756,XC.,It chanced auspiciously that ladies' dress
2757,XC.,"Was then not as we know it to have been,"
2758,XC.,That concentration of all ugliness--
2759,XC.,That awful bustle and the crinoline--
2760,XC.,"It would have been unfortunate, I mean,"
2761,XC.,"For their ascent, and with me you'll agree,"
2762,XC.,"It would have proved a hopeless case, I ween,"
2763,XC.,"And ended in a dire catastrophe,"
2764,XC.,Which simply would have been embarrassing you see.
2765,XC.,
2766,XC.,
2767,XCI.,XCI.
2768,XCI.,
2769,XCI.,The cottager sought nothing for his pains
2770,XCI.,And proffered trifles thankfully declined;
2771,XCI.,"Ah! happy they who think not of their gains,"
2772,XCI.,Who for the kindness only would be kind;
2773,XCI.,"But there are very few of such a mind,"
2774,XCI.,"That is as far as my experience goes,"
2775,XCI.,For love of self more often lurks behind
2776,XCI.,"A worthy action, and one seldom knows"
2777,XCI.,The true and real source from which a kindness flows.
2778,XCI.,
2779,XCI.,
2780,XCII.,XCII.
2781,XCII.,
2782,XCII.,"Now with his charges three was Rowland seated,"
2783,XCII.,"Then all and everyone exchanged ""good night,"""
2784,XCII.,And when that ceremony was completed
2785,XCII.,The cottager bent homeward with his light
2786,XCII.,And so did Gilbert. 'Twas a blessing quite
2787,XCII.,That matters were all settled as they were
2788,XCII.,"In their most awkward and distressing plight,--"
2789,XCII.,As Dora thought especially for her
2790,XCII.,It was indeed unfortunate it should occur.
2791,XCII.,
2792,XCII.,
2793,XCIII.,XCIII.
2794,XCIII.,
2795,XCIII.,When they arrived at Elleston Farm they found
2796,XCIII.,"Such dire dismay as ne'er before was seen,"
2797,XCIII.,Papa dispatching to the places round
2798,XCIII.,"Some messengers to know where they had been,"
2799,XCIII.,"It really was a most excited scene,"
2800,XCIII.,"With Julia, Ma, and Hannah at the gate"
2801,XCIII.,To see if information they could glean
2802,XCIII.,"In much alarm since it was now so late,"
2803,XCIII.,For Dora told them that they should return by eight.
2804,XCIII.,
2805,XCIII.,
2806,XCIV.,XCIV.
2807,XCIV.,
2808,XCIV.,"Ma gave a dismal shriek and swooned away,"
2809,XCIV.,"And Julia (bless her!) tried to do so too,"
2810,XCIV.,"Most naturally so, for truth to say"
2811,XCIV.,It was a dreary spectacle to view;
2812,XCIV.,"Soon to the house they hurriedly withdrew,"
2813,XCIV.,All those who kept their footing and were able;
2814,XCIV.,With Ma and Julia there was much ado
2815,XCIV.,"Since they between them made a little Babel,"
2816,XCIV.,While Hannah screamed and staggered back upon the table.
2817,XCIV.,
2818,XCIV.,
2819,XCV.,XCV.
2820,XCV.,
2821,XCV.,"To Dora Rowland was, of course, attentive,"
2822,XCV.,"Yes, very so; he also did his best"
2823,XCV.,"For th' others, using every preventive"
2824,XCV.,Against a second swoon one could suggest;
2825,XCV.,"His efforts I am glad to say were blest,"
2826,XCV.,"Tho' Dora was quite helpless from the fall,"
2827,XCV.,"But Hannah went on just like one possessed,"
2828,XCV.,While Julia did the lackadaisical
2829,XCV.,And wagged her head most drearily against the wall.
2830,XCV.,
2831,XCV.,
2832,XCVI.,XCVI.
2833,XCVI.,
2834,XCVI.,"Ere long there was an end to the confusion,"
2835,XCVI.,"And everyone came back to common sense,"
2836,XCVI.,Then all the household joined in the conclusion
2837,XCVI.,"It was a fearful blow, at all events"
2838,XCVI.,"Poor Dora's sufferings were most intense,"
2839,XCVI.,"And prudently she was despatched to bed,"
2840,XCVI.,"Permitted to remain on no pretence,"
2841,XCVI.,"And there the household bandaged up her head,"
2842,XCVI.,For all lent their assistance as I should have said.
2843,XCVI.,
2844,XCVI.,
2845,XCVII.,XCVII.
2846,XCVII.,
2847,XCVII.,Respecting how they spent their length of time
2848,XCVII.,"There was a lot to say as you'd suppose,"
2849,XCVII.,(Which I will not repeat to you in rhyme)
2850,XCVII.,"Concerning their enjoyments and their woes,"
2851,XCVII.,"And all such trivialities as those,"
2852,XCVII.,"Or thanks to him to whom such thanks were due,"
2853,XCVII.,"And query after query then arose,"
2854,XCVII.,"And pleasant incidents by no means few,"
2855,XCVII.,As under the like circumstances always do.
2856,XCVII.,
2857,XCVII.,
2858,XCVIII.,XCVIII.
2859,XCVIII.,
2860,XCVIII.,"Supper despatched, our Rowland started back"
2861,XCVIII.,"Loaded with thanks and all that words could speak,"
2862,XCVIII.,"The stars were overcast, the night was black,"
2863,XCVIII.,The wind arose as from some sudden freak;
2864,XCVIII.,"At intervals was seen a livid streak,"
2865,XCVIII.,And distant rumblings fell upon the ear;
2866,XCVIII.,'Twas true a storm had threatened all the week
2867,XCVIII.,"And lurked about the sultry atmosphere,"
2868,XCVIII.,"Then was the time they were to have it, it was clear."
2869,XCVIII.,
2870,XCVIII.,
2871,XCIX.,XCIX.
2872,XCIX.,
2873,XCIX.,"Yet these were tokens Rowland did not heed,"
2874,XCIX.,"Such trifles then he little cared about,"
2875,XCIX.,As he upon his journey did proceed
2876,XCIX.,He was disturbed within more than without
2877,XCIX.,"And dead to all around I've not a doubt,"
2878,XCIX.,"Absorbed in thoughts that words can ne'er define,"
2879,XCIX.,"Yet you can guess, my reader, what about,"
2880,XCIX.,"Most likely such as those have once been thine,"
2881,XCIX.,I really fail to count how often they've been mine.
2882,XCIX.,
2883,XCIX.,

2885,C.,
2886,C.,"Within him was a feeling as of pain,--"
2887,C.,"That melancholy music in whose tone,"
2888,C.,"Though full of sadness, something sweet doth reign,"
2889,C.,And Rowland for the first time felt _alone_;
2890,C.,How often hath this feeling been our own
2891,C.,"When all is--what? compared to something dear,"
2892,C.,"When former pleasures all, yea, all have flown,"
2893,C.,"And life is centred in another sphere,"
2894,C.,And all the world is nothing if one be not near.
2895,C.,
2896,C.,
2897,CI.,CI.
2898,CI.,
2899,CI.,There was a something in the heaven above
2900,CI.,That corresponded with his state of mind;
2901,CI.,"We all know what it is to be in love,"
2902,CI.,"When all Earth's sweetest pleasures seem combined,"
2903,CI.,"When Life and Love both, both are intertwined,"
2904,CI.,"And the young blood is as the desert's thirst,"
2905,CI.,"A scorching wilderness, a torrid wind,"
2906,CI.,A torrent with its flood-gates open burst;
2907,CI.,When Youth's most cherished hopes within the breast are nursed.

2909,CI.,
2910,CII.,CII.
2911,CII.,
2912,CII.,"O tell me not that Youth, all youth is folly,"
2913,CII.,"Give me the kiss that youth doth first impress,"
2914,CII.,"O let me feel love's ling'ring melancholy,"
2915,CII.,And smile on lips all youthful loveliness!
2916,CII.,Give me the bosom I can fondly press
2917,CII.,"While Youth's hot blood is burning in the veins,"
2918,CII.,O what but this is earthly happiness?
2919,CII.,This world no sweeter thing than this contains;
2920,CII.,"When days of youth are o'er, life's foremost pleasure wanes."

2922,CII.,
2923,CIII.,CIII.
2924,CIII.,
2925,CIII.,"Yes, Youth was made for such; it is enough"
2926,CIII.,To know in some fond heart our words abide;
2927,CIII.,"Oh life's not life but death without a love,"
2928,CIII.,All ceaseless darkness where she is denied!
2929,CIII.,We know not our existence till we hide
2930,CIII.,Our soul within another's there to be
2931,CIII.,Its very being: like a river wide
2932,CIII.,"Love rolls its endless volumes to the sea,"
2933,CIII.,Losing itself within its own immensity.
2934,CIII.,
2935,CIII.,

2937,CIV.,
2938,CIV.,There is a sort of torture which attends
2939,CIV.,"That most delightful of the heart's delights,"
2940,CIV.,A sort of cruelty which somehow blends
2941,CIV.,With passion in its most distracted flights;
2942,CIV.,And absence from a bosom that requites
2943,CIV.,An all-absorbing love is as a flame
2944,CIV.,"Fed ten-fold, yet insatiate; it excites"
2945,CIV.,"Those maddened cravings which the breast inflame,"
2946,CIV.,"Those fiery, longing gasps within the fevered frame."

2951,CV.,"However, I'm too fond of pondering"
2952,CV.,"When it's so necessary to proceed,"
2953,CV.,And on to worthless topics wandering
2954,CV.,"To which my friends will pay but little heed,"
2955,CV.,All those I mean who take my book and read
2956,CV.,"Those matters that they studied long ago,"
2957,CV.,Who of such information have no need
2958,CV.,And want to hear of something they don't know;
2959,CV.,I know what's due to them and they shall have it so.

2964,CVI.,"'Twas Dora, as by now you will have guessed,"
2965,CVI.,"Who was the burden of poor Rowland's thought,"
2966,CVI.,He was not merely by her face impressed
2967,CVI.,"But loved her to distraction as he ought,"
2968,CVI.,It is you know the popular report
2969,CVI.,That the best love is love at the first sight;
2970,CVI.,"If such is true or not it matters nought,"
2971,CVI.,"I'd rather not discuss the point to-night,"
2972,CVI.,It won't affect our story whether wrong or right.

2977,CVII.,I think and I've good reason to suppose
2978,CVII.,"This was a first-sight love, but who can say"
2979,CVII.,For certain if it was so? Goodness knows
2980,CVII.,If he conceived it in amongst the hay:
2981,CVII.,If I hear rightly ever since that day
2982,CVII.,He had been somewhat quieter than before
2983,CVII.,And had been known to take himself away
2984,CVII.,To wander long alone upon the shore:
2985,CVII.,Such oddities betoken love you may be sure.

2989,CVIII.,
2990,CVIII.,"Ah, who may tell what crowding thoughts arose"
2991,CVIII.,"Where boiled the tumult of Love's surging sea,"
2992,CVIII.,"That strength this world itself could not enclose,"
2993,CVIII.,Nor Space with infinite immensity!
2994,CVIII.,"But there no matter why, love is to be"
2995,CVIII.,"While men and women both are what they are,"
2996,CVIII.,"While eyes can wander unrestrainedly,"
2997,CVIII.,"And light on dimpled cheeks unknown to Ma,"

3005,CIX.,"And slash the heart to mincemeat through and through,"
3006,CIX.,And make ten thousand lives some few years shorter;
3007,CIX.,"Those eyes that make beholding lips quite water,"
3008,CIX.,"Full many a Don Giovani die o' grief,"
3009,CIX.,Which yield the love-sick populace no quarter
3010,CIX.,"And--(isn't it cruel?) give them no relief,"
3011,CIX.,And work no end of miracles in my belief!

3013,CIX.,
3014,CX.,CX.
3015,CX.,
3016,CX.,"Which rudely tilt Love's overflowing cup,"

3019,CX.,"What is there that they can't do, who shall say?"
3020,CX.,"While for one glance a thousand pine away,"
3021,CX.,Which certainly is most disastrous when
3022,CX.,"Our span is not too long as you will say,"
3023,CX.,And what of their short three score years and ten?

3029,CXI.,A friend of mine observed some time ago

3032,CXI.,Tho' very often certainly it may;
3033,CXI.,At any rate you know I mean to say
3034,CXI.,"They very seldom put men at their ease,"
3035,CXI.,"Once wedded in a week can turn 'em grey,"

3044,CXII.,"I never knew that fancied state of bliss,"
3045,CXII.,"I'm not, my friends, in short, a married man,"
3046,CXII.,So cannot judge as well as others can
3047,CXII.,"Who are more fortunate and have a wife,"
3048,CXII.,I would much rather live contented than
3049,CXII.,"Engaged in all the wars of married life,"
3050,CXII.,And what's more troublesome than matrimonial strife?
3051,CXII.,
3052,CXII.,
3053,CXIII.,CXIII.
3054,CXIII.,
3055,CXIII.,"In fact I often ""wish I were a bird"""

3058,CXIII.,"I'd visit all the windows of the fair,"
3059,CXIII.,"To see if they had kisses I could bear,"
3060,CXIII.,"And be the General Post Office above,"
3061,CXIII.,And do all sorts of things I do declare;
3062,CXIII.,"'Twere better, too, I think to be a dove,"

3071,CXIV.,So I must leave it for another day;
3072,CXIV.,"I should be whacked severely did I stay,"
3073,CXIV.,"And that would be a pity you must own,"
3074,CXIV.,And so 'twere better for me to obey

3084,CXV.,"My reader kind, between myself and you;"
3085,CXV.,So this abruptly-ended interview
3086,CXV.,"With circumstances such you will forgive,"
3087,CXV.,The thread of my narration I'll renew
3088,CXV.,"To-morrow or the next day if I live,"

3094,CXVI.,"Ta-ta for now, and may you ever be"

3099,CXVI.,"Let's see how long since last I flew my kite,"
3100,CXVI.,"Yes, certainly it must be some few months,"
3101,CXVI.,"And here I am again at it to-night,"

3111,CXVII.,"Full many have done better but few worse,"
3112,CXVII.,"And surely he's the very first to know it,"
3113,CXVII.,"Of course there's much to talk of when converse,"

3131,I.,"I take my goosequill for some recreation,"
3132,I.,"I'll have a pleasurable time to-night,"
3133,I.,A little change without the perturbation
3134,I.,Of nitro-glycerine and dynamite:
3135,I.,Just now I'm somewhat weary of the sight
3136,I.,Of dark disclosures in the morning news
3137,I.,"Which tell of crimes now daily brought to light,"
3138,I.,Of troublesome investigated clues
3139,I.,And horrifying details of the murderer's noose.
3140,I.,
3141,I.,
3142,II.,II.
3143,II.,
3144,II.,These are the days when each successive paper
3145,II.,Unfolds a tale which can but make it sell
3146,II.,(More usually the latest Irish caper)
3147,II.,And vendors should indeed be doing well;
3148,II.,When columns upon columns as they tell
3149,II.,Of blood-red things of horror and of shame
3150,II.,"Resemble much a penny horrible,"
3151,II.,"And which, in fact, they are, except in name,"
3152,II.,Altho' of course proprietors are not to blame.

3156,III.,
3157,III.,"Who would not wear the ermine-robe of Power,"
3158,III.,Who would not have the majesty of kings
3159,III.,"When tremble thrones and courts and nations cower,"
3160,III.,And strange alarms await all royal things--
3161,III.,When armëd horsemen guard their wanderings
3162,III.,"And palaces are silenced with affright,"
3163,III.,When morn discovers with her gleaming wings
3164,III.,"The dark and direful mysteries of the night,"
3165,III.,And men alternate weep and shudder at the sight?
3166,III.,
3167,III.,
3168,IV.,IV.
3169,IV.,
3170,IV.,"Of such things as I've said I'm getting weary,"
3171,IV.,"Such themes I leave to those who such-like choose,"
3172,IV.,"Some people's prospects must be somewhat dreary,"
3173,IV.,I shouldn't care to step within their shoes:
3174,IV.,"However, time I can't afford to lose,"
3175,IV.,"I merely say I'm wanting something new,"
3176,IV.,"At least my little self I must amuse,"
3177,IV.,"If I, my reader, can't enliven you,"
3178,IV.,So take my pen and ink determined what to do.
3179,IV.,
3180,IV.,
3181,V.,V.
3182,V.,
3183,V.,I will proceed with that which I have writ
3184,V.,"And tell what came of Dora and her lover,"
3185,V.,And let me ask you now I think of it
3186,V.,"To pardon faults if such you should discover,"
3187,V.,I mean not that I'm anxious you should cover
3188,V.,"The follies incidental to my case,"
3189,V.,"We must essay to understand each other,"
3190,V.,And look each other boldly in the face
3191,V.,If in each other's sympathy we seek a place.
3192,V.,
3193,V.,
3194,VI.,VI.
3195,VI.,
3196,VI.,Their days had hurried past as doth a dream
3197,VI.,(This is the favourite simile with us)
3198,VI.,And taking all together it would seem
3199,VI.,The dream had not implied an incubus;
3200,VI.,For my part I am somewhat dubious
3201,VI.,"If days like those before they all had known,"
3202,VI.,Tho' Dora's state had been precarious
3203,VI.,"For some three weeks or more I that must own,"
3204,VI.,But she'd recovered now. Oh how those days had flown!
3205,VI.,
3206,VI.,
3207,VII.,VII.
3208,VII.,
3209,VII.,"Yes, as I say, their time ere then was up--"
3210,VII.,"The harvest in--yet still they seemed to tarry,"
3211,VII.,"They'd quaffed the measure of their sparkling cup,"
3212,VII.,"They'd done their tithe of mischief like Old Harry,"
3213,VII.,"And so the days went on with dilly-dally,"
3214,VII.,"The Pater seemed unable to decide,"
3215,VII.,"At which their expectations seemed to rally,"
3216,VII.,"They hoped he'd stay another month beside,"
3217,VII.,While in this doubtful state the days did onward glide.
3218,VII.,
3219,VII.,
3220,VIII.,VIII.
3221,VIII.,
3222,VIII.,"And as for Rowland, there he might be seen"
3223,VIII.,"Beside his cherished Dora day by day,"
3224,VIII.,For regularly as a new machine
3225,VIII.,Across to Elleston Farm he bent his way:
3226,VIII.,There as the daylight softly stole away
3227,VIII.,"Would they together sing some little air,"
3228,VIII.,She in the gloaming hour would sit and play
3229,VIII.,"Some little movement that he liked to hear,"
3230,VIII.,"Which circumstances made it doubly, trebly dear."
3231,VIII.,
3232,VIII.,
3233,IX.,IX.
3234,IX.,
3235,IX.,"And there they sat while he, leaf after leaf,"
3236,IX.,O'erturned her music as her bosom rose
3237,IX.,"With words of fondness, ah, so low and brief,"
3238,IX.,That tender softness only woman knows:
3239,IX.,"While even o'er them wound that still repose,"
3240,IX.,"That hush of spirit and that soul of prayer,"
3241,IX.,That something which is only known to those
3242,IX.,"Who love and are beloved, who inly share"
3243,IX.,That sacred bliss with which no other can compare.
3244,IX.,
3245,IX.,
3246,X.,X.
3247,X.,
3248,X.,"They sang of love, while in each other's eye"
3249,X.,"Beamed that rich fulness of the throbbing breast,"
3250,X.,While on their lips there hung the deep-drawn sigh
3251,X.,Which told the form it deemed the loveliest:
3252,X.,"Ah, in those evening moments both were blest,"
3253,X.,"They read each other's bosom, oh, how well!"
3254,X.,And each to each their paradise confessed--
3255,X.,"That paradise that lovers love to tell,"
3256,X.,Which round and round each bosom twined its fairy-spell.
3257,X.,
3258,X.,
3259,XI.,XI.
3260,XI.,
3261,XI.,Now sunset fell upon her gilded hair
3262,XI.,"And tinged her brow with an angelic light,"
3263,XI.,"As tho' a heaven-born being lingered there,"
3264,XI.,"And Beauty, shamed, were weeping at the sight;"
3265,XI.,"Then out they strolled to meet the starlit night,"
3266,XI.,"He breathed Love's message on to rosy lips,"
3267,XI.,"While each partook that holy calm delight,"
3268,XI.,"Those sweetnesses alone a lover sips,"
3269,XI.,And which all other earthly sweetnesses eclipse.
3270,XI.,
3271,XI.,
3272,XII.,XII.
3273,XII.,
3274,XII.,"Oh, Love! Oh, Woman! What are ye that shine"
3275,XII.,"Man's ruling planet o'er this tossing sea,"
3276,XII.,"Who are the sculptors of his lot condign,"
3277,XII.,Who form the page of each man's destiny?
3278,XII.,"Oh, Love, the greatest of the great of thee"
3279,XII.,"Have said, thou sacrificest all to bless,"
3280,XII.,"That in thee is a gloom, and are not we"
3281,XII.,"Designed for thee, and born but to caress?"
3282,XII.,And those--they know thee not--who can thy joys express.
3283,XII.,
3284,XII.,
3285,XIII.,XIII.
3286,XIII.,
3287,XIII.,"""Disguise can't long hide love,"" 'tis even so:"
3288,XIII.,"We'll shake hands over that at any rate,"
3289,XIII.,"Let me refer to our friend Rochefoucauld,"
3290,XIII.,He knows a lot concerning Love and Hate.
3291,XIII.,"But still we wont these paths perambulate,"
3292,XIII.,What others say I merely here repeat
3293,XIII.,"So as my story I can illustrate,"
3294,XIII.,And hand you my authority complete;
3295,XIII.,To give my own experience would be indiscreet.
3296,XIII.,
3297,XIII.,
3298,XIV.,XIV.
3299,XIV.,
3300,XIV.,"Considering I'm but a youngster still,"
3301,XIV.,"That is to say I'm only just of age,"
3302,XIV.,"And I, as you will say, should leave it till"
3303,XIV.,"I'm past my ""salad days"" and can look sage;"
3304,XIV.,"Till o'er Life's road I've passed another stage,"
3305,XIV.,"And learned to smoke the pipe of common sense,"
3306,XIV.,"Which, you will gather from the present page,"
3307,XIV.,"I havn't learnt to yet at all events,"
3308,XIV.,Of which the present folly is a consequence.
3309,XIV.,
3310,XIV.,
3311,XV.,XV.
3312,XV.,
3313,XV.,But I was saying something about Dora
3314,XV.,But cannot recollect precisely what--
3315,XV.,Ah yes!--I now remember--her adorer--
3316,XV.,"And all about his most delightful lot,"
3317,XV.,That he had popped the question on the spot
3318,XV.,"(As I'd have done myself had I been he,"
3319,XV.,"Yes, no mistake about it, like a shot)"
3320,XV.,While chatting in the arbor _vis-a-vis_
3321,XV.,Enjoying love-like sweet nonsensicality.
3322,XV.,
3323,XV.,
3324,XVI.,XVI.
3325,XVI.,
3326,XVI.,"'Twas often that they did together sing,"
3327,XVI.,"And somehow music's fuel to the fire,"
3328,XVI.,"The thirsty flame of Love, and to it cling,"
3329,XVI.,Those sadnesses which speak the heart's desire;
3330,XVI.,There's in it that which doth the soul inspire.
3331,XVI.,"You'll recollect the words of Mirabeau,"
3332,XVI.,"The very last he spoke,--""Let me expire"
3333,XVI.,"To the delicious sounds of music""--so"
3334,XVI.,He gave a last long sigh and left this world of woe.
3335,XVI.,
3336,XVI.,
3337,XVII.,XVII.
3338,XVII.,
3339,XVII.,The greatest deeds this world has ever known
3340,XVII.,Were wrought beneath Euterpe's mystic spell.
3341,XVII.,When War's deep thunders boom and nations groan
3342,XVII.,"And rolling thunders tales of terror tell,"
3343,XVII.,"Then--then the heart rebounds within its cell,"
3344,XVII.,As th' charger halts to sniff the gory fray
3345,XVII.,"And, with the fiery mettle nought can quell,"
3346,XVII.,Bounds o'er the dead and dying on his way
3347,XVII.,To plunge amid the foe and meet the dreadful day.
3348,XVII.,
3349,XVII.,
3350,XVIII.,XVIII.
3351,XVIII.,
3352,XVIII.,Give _me_ the sound of martial music while
3353,XVIII.,"Ten times ten thousand close in clash of war,"
3354,XVIII.,"And, dashing o'er the red and mangled pile,"
3355,XVIII.,"Each man determines ""Now or nevermore!"""
3356,XVIII.,"While unsheathed sabres flash and cannons roar,"
3357,XVIII.,"And Fury, blindfold, hisses in its hate,"
3358,XVIII.,While Valour's shouts resound from shore to shore
3359,XVIII.,And nations strive their sons to vindicate
3360,XVIII.,And sovereigns bow the knee to t' inexorable Fate.
3361,XVIII.,
3362,XVIII.,
3363,XIX.,XIX.
3364,XIX.,
3365,XIX.,Give _me_ the note which did the true-born pride--
3366,XIX.,"That pride of will in all its strength awake,"
3367,XIX.,"Inflamed the hearts that for it sank and died,"
3368,XIX.,Those British hearts that burned for Glory's sake;
3369,XIX.,That song which bids insurgent nations shake
3370,XIX.,"Unto their deep foundations, and the world"
3371,XIX.,"From orient to occident to quake,"
3372,XIX.,"While battle's blood-red banner is unfurled,"
3373,XIX.,And haughty thrones are to their own destruction hurled.
3374,XIX.,
3375,XIX.,
3376,XX.,XX.
3377,XX.,
3378,XX.,"Give _me_ the notes that hush the raging seas,"
3379,XX.,"That urge the horseman and his charger on,"
3380,XX.,"Make foes disarm and fall upon their knees,"
3381,XX.,"And garlands fade where Victory once had shone,"
3382,XX.,"And vigorous Youth to glitter as the sun,"
3383,XX.,And frenzied Prowess with her tossing plume
3384,XX.,From off the gore-drenched field that she has won
3385,XX.,"To bear the trophies of a nation's doom,"
3386,XX.,While millions weep above an ignominious tomb.
3387,XX.,
3388,XX.,
3389,XXI.,XXI.
3390,XXI.,
3391,XXI.,"There lies the stalwart form in Death's last sleep,"
3392,XXI.,"There rest the foamy lip, the bloodshot eye,"
3393,XXI.,"The noble brow o'er which some heart doth weep,"
3394,XXI.,Whose only elegy--the buried sigh.
3395,XXI.,There kneels the friend and comrade who would die
3396,XXI.,"Beside the form he loved, alas, so well,"
3397,XXI.,"Now in his last expiring agony,"
3398,XXI.,"When every breath is as a funeral knell,"
3399,XXI.,And the soul bleeds with thoughts that Friendship cannot tell.
3400,XXI.,
3401,XXI.,
3402,XXII.,XXII.
3403,XXII.,
3404,XXII.,"The last long clasp, the hushed and trembling kiss,"
3405,XXII.,"The mother weeping at her beauty's side,"
3406,XXII.,"And Death's last look and stiffening clutch--is this,"
3407,XXII.,Is _this_ the outcome of a nation's pride?
3408,XXII.,"There lie the clammy corpses far and wide,"
3409,XXII.,"And locks bedabbled and the princely cheek,"
3410,XXII.,"Son, father, brother, husband, side by side--"
3411,XXII.,"Oh, such a tale of horror who can speak!"
3412,XXII.,"Together heaped the dead and dying, strong and weak."
3413,XXII.,
3414,XXII.,
3415,XXIII.,XXIII.
3416,XXIII.,
3417,XXIII.,"But to our text, my friends, as parsons say,"
3418,XXIII.,"This is soliloquy, I quite neglect"
3419,XXIII.,"My tale, from which I've wandered far away,"
3420,XXIII.,"But what, from such as I, can you expect?"
3421,XXIII.,I wished your kind attention to direct
3422,XXIII.,Some stanzas back--I think 'twas eight or nine--
3423,XXIII.,"To Music's wondrous power you'll recollect,"
3424,XXIII.,"But somehow left my subject line by line,"
3425,XXIII.,To which no doubt you'll say I should myself confine.

3429,XXIV.,
3430,XXIV.,"I am no minstrel, and I'd have you know it,"
3431,XXIV.,"Altho' that is the title of these pages,"
3432,XXIV.,"Nor do I yet pretend to be a poet,"
3433,XXIV.,"Those things that should be kept in wire cages,"
3434,XXIV.,"That move to Colney Hatch by easy stages,"
3435,XXIV.,"And keep good company upon the road,"
3436,XXIV.,"Consisting of some dozen or two sages,"
3437,XXIV.,"Who, like our tins of dynamite, explode,"

3442,XXV.,
3443,XXV.,"Now Pater surely something had in view,"
3444,XXV.,"Beyond his time he stayed so many days,"
3445,XXV.,Of this his daughters evidently knew
3446,XXV.,And all their expectations were ablaze;
3447,XXV.,But their excitement soon became a craze
3448,XXV.,Since he had made a grand resolve--in short
3449,XXV.,He had--and be it spoken to his praise--
3450,XXV.,"The villa, furnished, with its meadows bought;"
3451,XXV.,With much rejoicing this intelligence was fraught.
3452,XXV.,
3453,XXV.,
3454,XXVI.,XXVI.
3455,XXVI.,
3456,XXVI.,Arrangements had been made. The early train
3457,XXVI.,"He took to town to settle matters there,"
3458,XXVI.,Intending shortly to return again
3459,XXVI.,If all his town arrangements turned out fair.
3460,XXVI.,He'd travelled up on three occasions ere
3461,XXVI.,"His wife's idea had met with his consent,"
3462,XXVI.,No doubt about some business affair
3463,XXVI.,"O'er which in town a day or two he'd spent,"
3464,XXVI.,Now for the self-same reason there he pitched his tent.
3465,XXVI.,
3466,XXVI.,
3467,XXVII.,XXVII.
3468,XXVII.,
3469,XXVII.,"He did not tarry long but home did fly,"
3470,XXVII.,"His daughters went to meet him at the station,"
3471,XXVII.,And at the news they were in spirits high
3472,XXVII.,As was apparent by their conversation;
3473,XXVII.,"He was, of course, the very consummation"
3474,XXVII.,"Of all that was ""delicious"" and ""divine,"""
3475,XXVII.,"A home at Elleston pleased their contemplation,"
3476,XXVII.,"And as the sun each countenance did shine,"
3477,XXVII.,The very cocks and hens beamed with a look benign.
3478,XXVII.,
3479,XXVII.,
3480,XXVIII.,XXVIII.
3481,XXVIII.,
3482,XXVIII.,"The London residence was given o'er,"
3483,XXVIII.,"The furniture that was not sold was sent,"
3484,XXVIII.,"As it had been arranged it should before,"
3485,XXVIII.,"To Elleston, and much labour too they spent"
3486,XXVIII.,"In fixing all things to their hearts' content,"
3487,XXVIII.,"And cook, of course, was busy down there too,"
3488,XXVIII.,"While Pater often up to London went,"
3489,XXVIII.,"He had, as you may guess, a lot to do,"
3490,XXVIII.,And had his City business also to pursue.
3491,XXVIII.,
3492,XXVIII.,
3493,XXIX.,XXIX.
3494,XXIX.,
3495,XXIX.,So all was settled that he should divide
3496,XXIX.,"The time the City and his home between,"
3497,XXIX.,"For farm indeed he could, and well--for wide"
3498,XXIX.,His earlier experience had been.
3499,XXIX.,"The farm, tho' small, was large enough I ween,"
3500,XXIX.,"In fact it was a nice convenient size,"
3501,XXIX.,A prettier little spot was never seen
3502,XXIX.,"Than Elleston Farm, I'm sure, by human eyes,"
3503,XXIX.,And all seemed very happy in the enterprise.

3507,XXX.,
3508,XXX.,Some weeks elapsed e'er everything was straight;
3509,XXX.,"The shorter days were slowly coming round,"
3510,XXX.,"And all things told the year was getting late,"
3511,XXX.,And evening mists fell heavy to the ground.
3512,XXX.,"The distant woods were getting seared and browned,"
3513,XXX.,"And Autumn seemed abandoning her reign,"
3514,XXX.,"While leaf by leaf fell with a rustling sound,"
3515,XXX.,"That elegy of all the spreading plain,"
3516,XXX.,"And Winter, with his glistering crown, was near again."

3520,XXXI.,
3521,XXXI.,"The groves were still, save when the startled breeze,"
3522,XXXI.,"Like a sad smile which comes then fades away,"
3523,XXXI.,"Swept faintly o'er the amber of the trees,"
3524,XXXI.,And Nature's wheels moved slow and Life was gray:
3525,XXXI.,"Sadly and surely, like the darkening day,"
3526,XXXI.,Came dreary tokens of th' impending gloom;
3527,XXXI.,Fainter and fainter waned the solar ray
3528,XXXI.,"And all was heavy as the slumbering tomb,"
3529,XXXI.,Far thro' the hazy air did th' distant woodlands loom.
3530,XXXI.,
3531,XXXI.,
3532,XXXII.,XXXII.
3533,XXXII.,
3534,XXXII.,"The lonesome, lingering rose was drenched with dew,"
3535,XXXII.,"With hanging head aggrieving for its mate,"
3536,XXXII.,"It wept above the ground on which it grew,"
3537,XXXII.,With smiles all past and life disconsolate:
3538,XXXII.,There was the flower that clambered o'er the gate
3539,XXXII.,"Shrunk like the furrows of an old man's tear,"
3540,XXXII.,Each leaf had fallen at the touch of fate
3541,XXXII.,"And sunk to die upon its autumn bier,"
3542,XXXII.,And every breeze was sighing for the death-dealt year.

3546,XXXIII.,
3547,XXXIII.,"Be still, O heart, for Death steps noiseless nigh,"
3548,XXXIII.,Hist to the dirges o'er the sleeping sea!
3549,XXXIII.,Dim funeral trains pass melancholy by
3550,XXXIII.,And monotone their mournful minstrelsy.
3551,XXXIII.,"It is the grave that opes by Heav'n's decree,"
3552,XXXIII.,"And steeps each thing in its sepulchral breath,"
3553,XXXIII.,"The self-same grave that soon must yawn for thee,"
3554,XXXIII.,"The grave wherein all darkness slumbereth,"

3560,XXXIV.,"The garments of the arbour fell to earth,"
3561,XXXIV.,The arbour was deserted and the lawn
3562,XXXIV.,"Knew no repast of eve, no song of mirth,"
3563,XXXIV.,"No noonday lounge, for summer days were gone."
3564,XXXIV.,"The villa of its mantle all was shorn,"
3565,XXXIV.,No blinking puppy stretched upon the grass
3566,XXXIV.,"Enjoying sleepily the sunny morn,"
3567,XXXIV.,No sportive kitten frolicked there--alas!
3568,XXXIV.,No gaudy-tinted butterfly that way did pass.

3573,XXXV.,"When strolling through the dew-bespangled lane,"

3575,XXXV.,Within there speaks a something as of pain--
3576,XXXV.,Some sort of still lament for what hath been.
3577,XXXV.,A few short days ago and festoons green
3578,XXXV.,Clustered upon the bank in deepened shade
3579,XXXV.,"With graceful negligence, while close between"
3580,XXXV.,"The thorny twigs the autumn flowers played,"
3581,XXXV.,And the broad leaves swung lazily beside the glade.

3584,XXXVI.,XXXVI.
3585,XXXVI.,
3586,XXXVI.,"Now all was silence--like a palace hushed,"
3587,XXXVI.,Or hush of a deserted banquet-hall
3588,XXXVI.,Where wine so lately like a fountain gushed
3589,XXXVI.,And Grandeur stalked with mein imperial;
3590,XXXVI.,"Where death-like stillness doth the breast appal,"
3591,XXXVI.,Where revelry is changed to slumber sound
3592,XXXVI.,"And echoes only answer to the call,"
3593,XXXVI.,Save when along the corridors resound
3594,XXXVI.,"Departing footfalls, while in mystery all is bound."
3595,XXXVI.,
3596,XXXVI.,
3597,XXXVII.,XXXVII.
3598,XXXVII.,
3599,XXXVII.,Like some strange chamber--dimly lighted--vast--
3600,XXXVII.,"Where but an hour ago did Splendour tread,"
3601,XXXVII.,"Where royal feet swept on and Beauty passed,"
3602,XXXVII.,Where now the chaplet lies--forsaken--dead;
3603,XXXVII.,"Where Pleasure's palsied and the music fled,"
3604,XXXVII.,"Where peers the painted figure from the frame,"
3605,XXXVII.,"With dusky mantle and with hanging head,"
3606,XXXVII.,As tho' it felt the pang of inward shame
3607,XXXVII.,For an imperial ancient line and tarnished name.
3608,XXXVII.,
3609,XXXVII.,
3610,XXXVIII.,XXXVIII.
3611,XXXVIII.,
3612,XXXVIII.,"Yes, autumn sped away and with it passed"
3613,XXXVIII.,"Its ruddy rich delights, and winds blew high,"
3614,XXXVIII.,"And shriveled Winter, limping, came at last,"
3615,XXXVIII.,And leaden clouds flew o'er the dreary sky;
3616,XXXVIII.,"Yet still our cheerful heroines did defy,"
3617,XXXVIII.,"As all of them accustomed were to do,"
3618,XXXVIII.,"The weather's threatening inclemency,"
3619,XXXVIII.,"And long their old enjoyments did pursue,"
3620,XXXVIII.,They walked as they had done the happy summer through.
3621,XXXVIII.,
3622,XXXVIII.,
3623,XXXIX.,XXXIX.
3624,XXXIX.,
3625,XXXIX.,Now Rowland and his brothers' home lay near
3626,XXXIX.,"Across the fields, it was a farmhouse too,"
3627,XXXIX.,No parents had they and from year to year
3628,XXXIX.,They'd given their bailiff orders what to do.
3629,XXXIX.,"There side by side in harmony they grew,"
3630,XXXIX.,"Their days were pleasant and their income kind,"
3631,XXXIX.,And each his occupation did pursue
3632,XXXIX.,"With happy smiles and a contented mind,"
3633,XXXIX.,And hitherto to home their joys had been confined.
3634,XXXIX.,
3635,XXXIX.,
3636,XL.,XL.
3637,XL.,
3638,XL.,"But _now_ abroad did Rowland daily roam,"
3639,XL.,"And of him little did his brothers see,"
3640,XL.,"He knew no pleasure in the gates of home,"
3641,XL.,"But pensive strolled beside the surging sea,"
3642,XL.,"Delighting in its vast sublimity,"
3643,XL.,"And in the thunders of its mighty roll,"
3644,XL.,"While all his love flowed forth in poesy,"
3645,XL.,That love that fed the fountain of the soul:
3646,XL.,In _her_ his youthful hopes were folded like a scroll.

3649,XL.,
3650,XL.,
3651,XLI.,XLI.
3652,XLI.,
3653,XLI.,The scene is changed and years have onward sped;
3654,XLI.,Dora and Rowland had been long since one;
3655,XLI.,"She'd wept above her parents lying dead,"
3656,XLI.,"She--whose sole murmur was ""Thy will be done."""
3657,XLI.,"Yet life was happy as it had begun,"
3658,XLI.,"For tears but sweetened what was all so fair,"
3659,XLI.,Their days were golden as the sinking sun;
3660,XLI.,"The calm pervading all the soundless air,"
3661,XLI.,And heavenly smiles descended on that happy pair.
3662,XLI.,
3663,XLI.,
3664,XLII.,XLII.
3665,XLII.,
3666,XLII.,Flora and Rose ('twas strange that such should be)
3667,XLII.,"Were single still, nor on the way to marriage,"
3668,XLII.,Deeming a wife's responsibility
3669,XLII.,Perhaps a trifle more than they could manage;
3670,XLII.,By no means am I tending to disparage
3671,XLII.,"By my last line those who would wear the ring,"
3672,XLII.,"Repeat each phrase and step within their carriage,"
3673,XLII.,"By all means let them do the happy thing,"
3674,XLII.,Yet such a matter's worthy of considering.
3675,XLII.,
3676,XLII.,
3677,XLIII.,XLIII.
3678,XLIII.,
3679,XLIII.,"At least, whate'er the truth may be, they tell"
3680,XLIII.,(And little folks will always have their say)
3681,XLIII.,That Rose was once engaged to Lionel
3682,XLIII.,Who swore to love for ever and a day;
3683,XLIII.,But matters (and they often chance that way)
3684,XLIII.,"Abruptly turned and took a fitful start,"
3685,XLIII.,"'Twas whispered too, but be that as it may."
3686,XLIII.,That Rose with pestle and mortar broke his heart;
3687,XLIII.,So now it's up for auction in an auction-mart.
3688,XLIII.,
3689,XLIII.,
3690,XLIV.,XLIV.
3691,XLIV.,
3692,XLIV.,"And also, to the best of my _belief_,"
3693,XLIV.,"To Flora Gilbert fell upon his knees,"
3694,XLIV.,"But somehow matters seemed extremely brief,"
3695,XLIV.,"He rose, I _fancy_, somewhat ill at ease,"
3696,XLIV.,Then cursed his stars and hers for their decrees
3697,XLIV.,"(I wouldn't swear I'm telling you the truth),"
3698,XLIV.,"And so the clerk and parson lost their fees,"
3699,XLIV.,"Decidedly their stars were most uncouth,"
3700,XLIV.,For Flora was as gunpowder to Gilbert's youth.
3701,XLIV.,
3702,XLIV.,
3703,XLV.,XLV.
3704,XLV.,
3705,XLV.,So Lionel and Gilbert went abroad--
3706,XLV.,As youngsters do with circumstances thus--
3707,XLV.,"They left behind them all that they adored,"
3708,XLV.,"And said ""Good morning"" with no further fuss;"
3709,XLV.,"Their resignation was miraculous,"
3710,XLV.,Indeed what could they be but be resigned
3711,XLV.,"Beyond a tear upon their exodus,"
3712,XLV.,"A muttered oath or two when so inclined,"
3713,XLV.,Which served in some degree to soothe their state of mind.
3714,XLV.,
3715,XLV.,
3716,XLVI.,XLVI.
3717,XLVI.,
3718,XLVI.,"Rowland and Dora, as before I said,"
3719,XLVI.,"Located were three furlongs from the sand,"
3720,XLVI.,Three furlongs 'twas exactly from the head
3721,XLVI.,"Where sweeping views stretched wide on every hand,"
3722,XLVI.,"Far, far the eye could reach, o'er sea and land,"
3723,XLVI.,And in the glories of a summer's day
3724,XLVI.,"Their children, by the ocean breezes fanned,"
3725,XLVI.,"Would gambol long beneath the noontide ray,"
3726,XLVI.,"And with bright laughter wile the long, long hours away."
3727,XLVI.,
3728,XLVI.,
3729,XLVII.,XLVII.
3730,XLVII.,
3731,XLVII.,"O God, could I so feel that young delight--"
3732,XLVII.,"That young delight that knows no thought of pain,"
3733,XLVII.,"Where all is now the ceaseless gloom of night,"
3734,XLVII.,O give me but my childhood back again;
3735,XLVII.,O let me wander o'er that flowery plain
3736,XLVII.,"And once more pluck the sweets of other days,"
3737,XLVII.,"Few, few of childhood's joys for me remain,"
3738,XLVII.,"And life is bent o'er sterner, stonier ways"
3739,XLVII.,Whose solitary solace is a backward gaze.
3740,XLVII.,
3741,XLVII.,
3742,XLVIII.,XLVIII.
3743,XLVIII.,
3744,XLVIII.,"Still by the sands live Rowland and his wife,"
3745,XLVIII.,"And now the old house rings with boyhood's glee,"
3746,XLVIII.,"For truly both are getting on in life,"
3747,XLVIII.,Their sturdy youngsters number two or three;
3748,XLVIII.,So they are quite a happy family
3749,XLVIII.,"With Rose and Flora and their blithesome fun,"
3750,XLVIII.,"With circumstances thus they ought to be,"
3751,XLVIII.,Their lot is good enough for anyone.
3752,XLVIII.,"And now, my indulgent readers all, my tale is done."

3754,XLVIII.,
3755,XLIX.,XLIX.
3756,XLIX.,
3757,XLIX.,My tale is done--'tis even so--I fear
3758,XLIX.,"That very few have borne with me till now,"
3759,XLIX.,"For laurels are exorbitantly dear,"
3760,XLIX.,And so I can't expect a laureled brow;
3761,XLIX.,"Permit me then to make my humble bow,"
3762,XLIX.,My title-page must bid me blush for shame;
3763,XLIX.,"O reader, stay, ere you my Muse allow,"
3764,XLIX.,"And add thy pity to the meagre name,"
3765,XLIX.,Forsooth no solitary laurel can it claim.

3771,L.,"I'm certain that I can't excuse my rhyme,"
3772,L.,"But now 'tis simply useless to deplore,"
3773,L.,I may do better though another time;
3774,L.,"My tedious numbers are, I know, a crime,"
3775,L.,"An outrage on the world of common sense,"
3776,L.,'Tis certain I've not yet contrived to climb
3777,L.,"The literary pole, at all events,"
3778,L.,Or scale Olympus where the Muses pitch their tents.

3783,LI.,"My reader, 'tis with feelings as of sorrow"
3784,LI.,"I lay aside my paper and my pen,"
3785,LI.,I've half a mind to drown myself to-morrow
3786,LI.,"And will myself to Hell, like other men,"
3787,LI.,"For writing such a thing of rhyme--but then,"
3788,LI.,"As someone wrote, ""There's good in everything,"""
3789,LI.,"So we must both have faith, you see, and when"
3790,LI.,We meet again I hope that I may sing
3791,LI.,A song that's much more worthy of the publishing.
