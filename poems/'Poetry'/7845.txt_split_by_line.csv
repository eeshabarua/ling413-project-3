73,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY
74,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,
75,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,
76,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,It would have been fitting had I dedicated Spoon River Anthology to
77,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"you. Considerations of an intimate nature, not to mention a literary"
78,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"encouragement which was before yours, crowded you from the page.  Yet"
79,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"you know that it was you who pressed upon my attention in June, 1909,"
80,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,the Greek Anthology. It was from contemplation of its epitaphs that my
81,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"hand unconsciously strayed to the sketches of ""Hod Putt,"" ""Serepta The"
82,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"Scold"" (""Serepta Mason"" in the book), ""Amanda Barker"" (""Amanda"" in the"
83,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"book), ""Ollie McGee"" and ""The Unknown,"" the first written and the"
84,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,first printed sketches of The Spoon River Anthology.  The
85,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"_Mirror_ of May 29th, 1914, is their record."
86,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,
87,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,I take one of the epigrams of Meleager with its sad revealment and
88,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"touch of irony and turn it from its prose form to a verse form, making"
89,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,verses according to the breath pauses:
90,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,
91,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"""The holy night and thou, O Lamp, we took as witness of our vows; and"
92,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"before thee we swore, he that would love me always and I that I would"
93,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"never leave him. We swore, and thou wert witness of our double"
94,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,promise. But now he says that our vows were written on the running
95,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"waters. And thou, O Lamp, thou seest him in the arms of another."""
96,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,
97,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,In verse this epigram is as follows:
98,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,
99,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"The holy night and thou,"
100,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"O Lamp,"
101,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,We took as witness of our vows;
102,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"And before thee we swore,"
103,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,He that would love me always
104,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,And I that I would never leave him.
105,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"We swore,"
106,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,And thou wert witness of our double promise.
107,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,But now he says that our vows were written on the running waters.
108,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"And thou, O Lamp,"
109,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,Thou seest him in the arms of another.
110,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,
111,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,It will be observed that iambic feet prevail in this translation. They
112,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,merely become noticeable and imperative when arranged in verses. But
113,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"so it is, even in the briefest and starkest rendering of these"
114,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,epigrams from the Greek the humanism and dignity of the original
115,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"transfer themselves, making something, if less than verse, yet more"
116,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"than prose; as Byron said of Sheridan's speeches, neither poetry nor"
117,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"oratory, but better than either. It was no difficult matter to pass"
118,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,from Chase Henry:
119,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,
120,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"""In life I was the town drunkard."
121,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,When I died the priest denied me burial
122,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"In holy ground, etc."""
123,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,
124,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"to the use of standard measures, or rhythmical arrangements of iambics"
125,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"or what not, and so to make a book, which for the first third required"
126,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,a practiced voice or eye to yield the semblance of verse; and for the
127,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"last two-thirds, or nearly so, accommodated itself to the less"
128,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,sensitive conception of the average reader.  The prosody was allowed
129,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,to take care of itself under the emotional requirements and
130,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,inspiration of the moment. But there is nothing new in English
131,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"literature for some hundreds of years in combinations of dactyls,"
132,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"anapests or trochees, and without rhyme.  Nor did I discover to the"
133,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,world that an iambic pentameter can be lopped to a tetrameter without
134,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,the verse ceasing to be an iambic; though it be no longer the blank
135,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,verse which has so ennobled English poetry.  A great deal of unrhymed
136,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,poetry is yet to be written in the various standard rhythms and in
137,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,carefully fashioned metres.
138,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,
139,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"But obviously a formal resuscitation of the Greek epigrams, ironical"
140,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"and tender, satirical and sympathetic, as casual experiments in"
141,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,unrelated themes would scarcely make the same appeal that an epic
142,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"rendition of modern life would do, and as it turned out actually"
143,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,achieved.
144,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,
145,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,The response of the American press to Spoon River Anthology during the
146,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,summer of 1914 while it was appearing in the _Mirror_ is my
147,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,warrant for saying this.  It was quoted and parodied during that time
148,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,in the country and in the metropolitan newspapers. _Current
149,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"Opinion_ in its issue of September, 1914, reproduced from the"
150,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,_Mirror_ some of the poems. Though at this time the schematic
151,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"effect of the Anthology could not be measured, Edward J. Wheeler, that"
152,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,devoted patron of the art and discriminating critic of its
153,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"manifestations, was attracted, I venture to say, by the substance of"
154,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"""Griffy, The Cooper,"" for that is one of the poems from the Anthology"
155,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"which he set forth in his column ""The Voice of Living Poets"" in the"
156,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"issue referred to.  _Poetry, A Magazine of Verse_, followed in"
157,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"its issue of October, 1914, with a reprinting from the _Mirror_."
158,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"In a word, the Anthology went the rounds over the country before it"
159,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,was issued in book form. And a reception was thus prepared for the
160,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,complete work not often falling to the lot of a literary production.
161,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,I must not omit an expression of my gratitude for the very high praise
162,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,which John Cowper Powys bestowed on the Anthology just before it
163,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,appeared in book form and the publicity which was given his lecture by
164,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,the _New York Times_. Nathan Haskell Dole printed an article in
165,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"the Boston _Transcript_ of June 30, 1915, in which he contrasted"
166,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"the work with the Greek Anthology, pointing in particular to certain"
167,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"epitaphs by Carphylides, Kallaischros and Pollianos.  The critical"
168,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,testimony of Miss Harriet Monroe in her editorial comments and in her
169,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"preface to ""The New Poetry"" has greatly strengthened the judgment of"
170,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,to-day against a reversal at the hands of a later criticism.
171,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,
172,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,This response to the Anthology while it was appearing in the
173,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,_Mirror_ and afterwards when put in the book was to nothing so
174,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,much as to the substance. It was accepted as a picture of our life in
175,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,America. It was interpreted as a transcript of the state of mind of
176,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,men and women here and elsewhere. You called it a Comedy Humaine in
177,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,your announcement of my identity as the author in the _Mirror_ of
178,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"November 20, 1914. If the epitaphic form gave added novelty I must"
179,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,confess that the idea was suggested to me by the Greek Anthology.  But
180,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,it was rather because of the Greek Anthology than from it that I
181,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,evolved the less harmonious epitaphs with which Spoon River Anthology
182,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,was commenced.  As to metrical epitaphs it is needless to say that I
183,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,drew upon the legitimate materials of authentic English versification.
184,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"Up to the Spring of 1914, I had never allowed a Spring to pass without"
185,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,reading Homer; and I feel that this familiarity had its influence both
186,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,as to form and spirit; but I shall not take the space now to pursue
187,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,this line of confessional.
188,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,
189,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,What is the substance of which I have spoken if it be not the life
190,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"around us as we view it through eyes whose vision lies in heredity,"
191,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"mode of life, understanding of ourselves and of our place and time?"
192,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,You have lived much. As a critic and a student of the country no one
193,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"understands America better than you do. As a denizen of the west, but"
194,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,as a surveyor of the east and west you have brought to the country's
195,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,interpretation a knowledge of its political and literary life as well
196,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,as a proficiency in the history of other lands and other times. You
197,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,have seen and watched the unfolding of forces that sprang up after the
198,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,Civil War. Those forces mounted in the eighties and exploded in free
199,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,silver in 1896. They began to hit through the directed marksmanship of
200,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,Theodore Roosevelt during his second term. You knew at first hand all
201,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"that went with these forces of human hope, futile or valiant endeavor,"
202,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,articulate or inarticulate expression of the new birth.  You saw and
203,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"lived, but in greater degree, what I have seen and lived. And with"
204,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,this back-ground you inspired and instructed me in my analysis.
205,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,Standing by you confirmed or corrected my sculpturing of the clay
206,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,taken out of the soil from which we both came.  You did this with an
207,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"eye familiar with the secrets of the last twenty years, familiar also"
208,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,with the relation of those years to the time which preceded and bore
209,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,them.
210,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,
211,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"So it is, that not only because I could not dedicate Spoon River to"
212,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"you, but for the larger reasons indicated, am I impelled to do you"
213,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,whatever honor there may be in taking your name for this book. By this
214,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"outline confession, sometime perhaps to be filled in, do I make known"
215,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,what your relation is to these interpretations of mine resulting from
216,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"a spirit, life, thought, environment which have similarly come to us"
217,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,and have similarly affected us.
218,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,
219,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"I call this book ""Toward the Gulf,"" a title importing a continuation"
220,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,of the attempts of Spoon River and The Great Valley to mirror the age
221,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,and the country in which we live. It does not matter which one of
222,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"these books carries your name and makes these acknowledgments; so far,"
223,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,"anyway, as the opportunity is concerned for expressing my appreciation"
224,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,of your friendship and the great esteem and affectionate interest in
225,TO WILLIAM MARION REEDY,which I hold you.

469,TOWARD THE GULF,"There will be lake boats,"
470,TOWARD THE GULF,"With port holes, funnels, rows of decks,"
471,TOWARD THE GULF,"Huddled like swans by the docks,"
472,TOWARD THE GULF,Under the shadows of cliffs of brick.
473,TOWARD THE GULF,"And who will know from the prints to be,"
474,TOWARD THE GULF,"When the Albatross and the Golden Eagle,"
475,TOWARD THE GULF,The flying craft which shall carry the vision
476,TOWARD THE GULF,Of impatient lovers wounded by Spring
477,TOWARD THE GULF,"To the shaded rivers of Michigan,"
478,TOWARD THE GULF,"That it was the Missouri, the Iowa,"
479,TOWARD THE GULF,And the City of Benton Harbor
480,TOWARD THE GULF,Which lay huddled like swans by the docks?
481,TOWARD THE GULF,
482,TOWARD THE GULF,"You are not Lake Leman,"
483,TOWARD THE GULF,Walled in by Mt. Blanc.
484,TOWARD THE GULF,"One sees the whole world round you,"
485,TOWARD THE GULF,"And beyond you, Lake Michigan."
486,TOWARD THE GULF,And when the melodious winds of March
487,TOWARD THE GULF,Wrinkle you and drive on the shore
488,TOWARD THE GULF,"The serpent rifts of sand and snow,"
489,TOWARD THE GULF,"And sway the giant limbs of oaks,"
490,TOWARD THE GULF,"Longing to bud,"
491,TOWARD THE GULF,"The boats put forth for the ports that began to stir,"
492,TOWARD THE GULF,"With the creak of reels unwinding the nets,"
493,TOWARD THE GULF,And the ring of the caulking wedge.
494,TOWARD THE GULF,But in the June days--
495,TOWARD THE GULF,The Alabama ploughs through liquid tons
496,TOWARD THE GULF,Of sapphire waves.
497,TOWARD THE GULF,"She sinks from hills to valleys of water,"
498,TOWARD THE GULF,"And rises again,"
499,TOWARD THE GULF,Like a swimming gull!
500,TOWARD THE GULF,"I wish a hundred years to come, and forever"
501,TOWARD THE GULF,All lovers could know the rapture
502,TOWARD THE GULF,Of the lake boats sailing the first Spring days
503,TOWARD THE GULF,"To coverts of hepatica,"
504,TOWARD THE GULF,"With the whole world sphering round you,"
505,TOWARD THE GULF,And the whole of the sky beyond you.

507,TOWARD THE GULF,I knew the captain of the City of Grand Rapids.
508,TOWARD THE GULF,He had sailed the seas as a boy.
509,TOWARD THE GULF,And he stood on deck against the railing
510,TOWARD THE GULF,"Puffing a cigar,"
511,TOWARD THE GULF,Showing in his eyes the cinema flash of the sun on the waves.
512,TOWARD THE GULF,It was June and life was easy. ...
513,TOWARD THE GULF,"One could lie on deck and sleep,"
514,TOWARD THE GULF,Or sit in the sun and dream.
515,TOWARD THE GULF,"People were walking the decks and talking,"
516,TOWARD THE GULF,Children were singing.
517,TOWARD THE GULF,And down on the purser's deck
518,TOWARD THE GULF,"A man was dancing by himself,"
519,TOWARD THE GULF,Whirling around like a dervish.
520,TOWARD THE GULF,And this captain said to me:
521,TOWARD THE GULF,"""No life is better than this."
522,TOWARD THE GULF,"I could live forever,"
523,TOWARD THE GULF,And do nothing but run this boat
524,TOWARD THE GULF,From the dock at Chicago to the dock at Holland
525,TOWARD THE GULF,"And back again."""
526,TOWARD THE GULF,
527,TOWARD THE GULF,One time I went to Grand Haven
528,TOWARD THE GULF,On the Alabama with Charley Shippey.
529,TOWARD THE GULF,"It was dawn, but white dawn only,"
530,TOWARD THE GULF,"Under the reign of Leucothea,"
531,TOWARD THE GULF,"As we volplaned, so it seemed, from the lake"
532,TOWARD THE GULF,Past the lighthouse into the river.
533,TOWARD THE GULF,And afterward laughing and talking
534,TOWARD THE GULF,Hurried to Van Dreezer's restaurant
535,TOWARD THE GULF,For breakfast.
536,TOWARD THE GULF,(Charley knew him and talked of things
537,TOWARD THE GULF,Unknown to me as he cooked the breakfast.)
538,TOWARD THE GULF,Then we fished the mile's length of the pier
539,TOWARD THE GULF,In a gale full of warmth and moisture
540,TOWARD THE GULF,"Which blew the gulls about like confetti,"
541,TOWARD THE GULF,And flapped like a flag the linen duster
542,TOWARD THE GULF,Of a fisherman who paced the pier--
543,TOWARD THE GULF,(Charley called him Rip Van Winkle).
544,TOWARD THE GULF,The only thing that could be better
545,TOWARD THE GULF,Than this day on the pier
546,TOWARD THE GULF,"Would be its counterpart in heaven,"
547,TOWARD THE GULF,As Swedenborg would say--
548,TOWARD THE GULF,"Charley is fishing somewhere now, I think."
549,TOWARD THE GULF,
550,TOWARD THE GULF,There is a grove of oaks on a bluff by the river
551,TOWARD THE GULF,At Berrien Springs.
552,TOWARD THE GULF,There is a cottage that eyes the lake
553,TOWARD THE GULF,Between pines and silver birches
554,TOWARD THE GULF,At South Haven.
555,TOWARD THE GULF,There is the inviolable wonder of wooded shore
556,TOWARD THE GULF,Curving for miles at Saugatuck.
557,TOWARD THE GULF,And at Holland a beach like Scheveningen's.
558,TOWARD THE GULF,And at Charlevoix the sudden quaintness
559,TOWARD THE GULF,Of an old-world place by the sea.
560,TOWARD THE GULF,There are the hills around Elk Lake
561,TOWARD THE GULF,Where the blue of the sky is so still and clear
562,TOWARD THE GULF,It seems it was rubbed above them
563,TOWARD THE GULF,By the swipe of a giant thumb.
564,TOWARD THE GULF,And beyond these the little Traverse Bay
565,TOWARD THE GULF,Where the roar of the breeze goes round
566,TOWARD THE GULF,"Like a roulette ball in the groove of the wheel,"
567,TOWARD THE GULF,"Circling the bay,"
568,TOWARD THE GULF,And beyond these Mackinac and the Cheneaux Islands--
569,TOWARD THE GULF,And beyond these a great mystery!--
570,TOWARD THE GULF,
571,TOWARD THE GULF,"Neither ice floes, nor winter's palsy"
572,TOWARD THE GULF,Stays the tide in the river.

773,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And she was a man, and he in part was a woman."
774,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"He stood in a pulpit and preached the Christ,"
775,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And the remission of sins by blood,"
776,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And the literal fall of man through Adam,"
777,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And the mystical and actual salvation of man
778,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Through the coming of Christ.
779,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,
780,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And she sat in a pew shading her great eyes
781,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,To hide her scorn for it all.
782,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"She was crucified,"
783,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And raged to the last like the impenitent thief
784,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Against the fate which wasted and trampled down
785,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Her wisdom, sagacity, versatile skill,"
786,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Which would have piled up gold or honors
787,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"For a mate who knew that life is growth,"
788,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And health, and the satisfaction of wants,"
789,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And place and reputation and mansion houses,"
790,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And mahogany and silver,"
791,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And beautiful living.
792,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"She hated him, and hence she pitied him."
793,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,She was like the gardener with great pruners
794,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Deciding to clip, sometimes not clipping"
795,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Just for the dread.
796,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,She had married him--but why?
797,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Some inscrutable air
798,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Wafted his pollen to her across a wide garden--
799,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Some power had crossed them.
800,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And here is the secret I think:
801,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,(As we would say here is electricity)
802,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,It is the vibration inhering in sex
803,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"That produces devils or angels,"
804,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And it is the sex reaction in men and women
805,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"That brings forth devils or angels,"
806,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And starts in them the germs of powers or passions,"
807,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Becoming loves, ferocities, gifts and weaknesses,"
808,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Till the stock dies out.
809,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,So now for their hybrid children:--
810,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,She gave birth to four daughters and one son.
811,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,
812,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,But first what have we for the composition of these daughters?
813,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Reason opposed and becoming keener therefor.
814,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Faith mocked and drawing its mantel closer.
815,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Love thwarted and becoming acid.
816,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Hatred mounting too high and thinning into pity.
817,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Hunger for life unappeased and becoming a stream under-ground
818,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Where only blind things swim.
819,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,God year by year removing himself to remoter thrones
820,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Of inexorable law.
821,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,God coming closer even while disease
822,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And total blindness came between him and God
823,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And defeated the mercy of God.
824,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And a love and a trust growing deeper in him
825,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"As she in great thirst, hanging on the cross,"
826,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Mocked his crucifixion,"
827,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And talked philosophy between the spasms of pain,"
828,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Till at last she is all satirist,"
829,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And he is all saint.
830,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,
831,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And all the children were raised
832,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"After the strictest fashion in New England,"
833,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And made to join the church,"
834,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And attend its services.
835,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And these were the children:
836,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,
837,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Janet was a religious fanatic and a virago,"
838,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"She debated religion with her husband for ten years,"
839,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Then he refused to talk, and for twenty years"
840,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Scarcely spoke to her.
841,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,She died a convert to Catholicism.
842,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,They had two children:
843,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,The boy became a forgerer
844,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Of notorious skill.
845,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"The daughter married, but was barren."
846,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,
847,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Miranda married a rich man
848,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And spent his money so fast that he failed.
849,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,She lashed him with a scorpion tongue
850,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And made him believe at last
851,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,With her incessant reasonings
852,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"That he was a fool, and so had failed."
853,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"In middle life he started over again,"
854,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,But became tangled in a law-suit.
855,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Because of these things he killed himself.
856,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,
857,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Louise was a nymphomaniac.
858,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,She was married twice.
859,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Both husbands fled from her insatiable embraces.
860,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"At thirty-two she became a woman on a telephone list,"
861,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Subject to be called,"
862,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And for two years ran through a daily orgy of sex,"
863,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"When blindness came on her, as it came on her father before her,"
864,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And she became a Christian Scientist,"
865,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And led an exemplary life.
866,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,
867,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Deborah was a Puritan of Puritans,"
868,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Her list of unmentionable things
869,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Tabooed all the secrets of creation,"
870,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Leaving politics, religion, and human faults,"
871,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And the mistakes most people make,"
872,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And the natural depravity of man,"
873,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And his freedom to redeem himself if he chooses,"
874,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,As the only subjects of conversation.
875,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"As a twister of words and meanings,"
876,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And a skilled welder of fallacies,"
877,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And a swift emerger from ineluctable traps of logic,"
878,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And a wit with an adder's tongue,"
879,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And a laugher,"
880,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And an unafraid facer of enemies,"
881,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Oppositions, hatreds,"
882,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,She never knew her equal.
883,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"She was at once very cruel, and very tender,"
884,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Very selfish and very generous
885,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Very little and very magnanimous.
886,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Scrupulous as to the truth, and utterly disregardless of the truth."
887,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,
888,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Of the keenest intuitions, yet gullible,"
889,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Easily used at times, of erratic judgment,"
890,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Analytic but pursuing with incredible swiftness
891,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,The falsest trails to her own undoing--
892,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,All in all the strangest mixture of colors and scent
893,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Derived from father and mother,"
894,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"But mixed by whom, and how, and why?"
895,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,
896,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Now for the son named Herman, rebel soul."
897,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"His brow was like a loaf of bread, his eyes"
898,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Turned from his father's blue to gray, his nose"
899,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Was like his mother's, skin was dark like hers."
900,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"His shapely body, hands and feet belonged"
901,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"To some patrician face, not to Marat's."
902,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And his was like Marat's, fanatical,"
903,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Materialistic, fierce, as it might guide"
904,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"A reptile's crawl, but yet he crawled to peaks"
905,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Loving the hues of mists, but not the mists"
906,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,His father loved. And being a rebel soul
907,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,He thought the world all wrong. A nothingness
908,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Moving as malice marred the life of man.
909,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"'Twas man's great work to fight this Giant Fraud,"
910,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And all who praise and serve Him. 'Tis for man
911,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"To free the world from error, suffer, die"
912,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,For liberty of thought. You see his mother
913,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Is in possession of one part of him,"
914,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Or all of him for some time.
915,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,
916,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,So he lives
917,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Nursing the dream (like father he's a dreamer)
918,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,That genius fires him. All the while a gift
919,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"For analytics stored behind that brow,"
920,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"That bulges like a loaf of bread, is all"
921,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Of which he well may boast above the man
922,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,He hates as but a slave of faith and fear.
923,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"He feeds luxurious doubt with Omar Khyam,"
924,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,But for long years neglects the jug of wine.
925,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And as for ""thou"" he does not wake for years,"
926,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Is a pure maiden when he weds, the grains"
927,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Run counter in him, end in knots at times."
928,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"He takes from father certain tastes and traits,"
929,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"From mother certain others, one can see"
930,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"His mother's sex re-actions to his father,"
931,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Not passed to him to make him celibate,"
932,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,But holding back in sleeping passions which
933,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Burst over bounds at last in lust, not love."
934,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Not love since that great engine in the brow
935,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Tears off the irised wings of love and bares
936,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,The poor worm's body where the wings had been:
937,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,What is it but desire? Such stuff in rhyme
938,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"In music over what is but desire,"
939,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And ends when that is satisfied!
940,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,
941,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,He's a crank.
942,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And follows all the psychic thrills which run
943,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"To cackles o'er the world. It's Looking Backward,"
944,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Or Robert Elsmere, Spencer's Social Statics,"
945,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"It's socialism, Anarchism, Peace,"
946,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"It's non-resistance with a swelling heart,"
947,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,As who should say how truer to the faith
948,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Of Jesus am I, without hope or faith,"
949,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Than churchmen. He's a prohibitionist,"
950,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"The poor's protagonist, the knight at arms"
951,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Of fallen women, yelling at the rich"
952,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Whose wicked greed makes all the prostitutes--
953,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,No prostitutes without the wicked rich!
954,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"But as he ages, as the bitter days"
955,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Approach with perorations: O ye vipers,"
956,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"The engine in him changes all the world,"
957,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Reverses all the wheels of thought behind.
958,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"For Nietzsche comes, and makes him superman."
959,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,He dumps the truth of Jesus over--there
960,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"It lies with his youth's textual skepticism,"
961,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And laughter at the supernatural.
962,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,
963,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Now what's the motivating principle
964,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Of such a mind? In youth he sought for rules
965,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Wherewith to trail and capture truths. He found it
966,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"In James McCosh's Logic, it was this:"
967,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Lex Exclusi Tertii aut Medii,"
968,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Law of Excluded Middle speaking plain:
969,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"A thing is true, or not true, never a third"
970,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Hypothesis, so God is or is not."
971,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"That's very good to start with, how to end"
972,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And how to know which of the two is false--
973,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"He hunted out the false, as mother did--"
974,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Requires a tool. He found it in this book,"
975,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Reductio ad absurdum; let us see
976,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Excluded middle use reductio.
977,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"God is or God is not, but then what God?"
978,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Excluded Middle never sought a God
979,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,To suffer demolition at his hands
980,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Except the God of Illinois, the God"
981,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Grown but a little with his followers
982,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Since Moses lived and Peter fished. So now
983,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,God is or God is not. Let us assume
984,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"God is and use reductio ad absurdum,"
985,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Taking away the rotten props, the posts"
986,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"That do not fit or hold, and let Him fall."
987,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"For if he falls, the other postulate"
988,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,That God is not is demonstrated. See
989,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,A universe of truth pass on the way
990,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Cleared by Excluded Middle through the stuff
991,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Of thought and visible things, a way that lets"
992,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"A greater God escape, uncaught by all"
993,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,The nippers of reductio ad absurdum.
994,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,But to resume his argument was this:
995,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"God is or God is not, but if God is"
996,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Why pestilence and war, earthquake and famine?"
997,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"He either wills them, or cannot prevent them,"
998,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"But if he wills them God is evil, if"
999,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"He can't prevent them, he is limited."
1000,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,
1001,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"But God, you say, is good, omnipotent,"
1002,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And here I prove Him evil, or too weak"
1003,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,To stay the evil. Having shown your God
1004,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Lacking in what makes God, the proposition"
1005,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Which I oppose to this, that God is not"
1006,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Stands proven. For as evil is most clear
1007,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"In sickness, pain and death, it cannot be"
1008,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"There is a Power with strength to overcome them,"
1009,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Yet suffers them to be.
1010,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,
1011,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And so this man
1012,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Went through the years of life, and stripped the fields"
1013,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Of beauty and of thought with mandibles
1014,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Insatiable as the locust's, which devours"
1015,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,A season's care and labor in an hour.
1016,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"He stripped these fields and ate them, but they made"
1017,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,No meat or fat for him. And so he lived
1018,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"On his own thought, as starving men may live"
1019,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,On stored up fat. And so in time he starved.
1020,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"The thought in him no longer fed his life,"
1021,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And he had withered up the outer world
1022,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Of man and nature, stripped it to the bone,"
1023,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Nothing but skull and cross-bones greeted him
1024,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Wherever he turned--the world became a bottle
1025,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Filled with a bitter essence he could drink
1026,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,From long accustomed doses--labeled poison
1027,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And marked with skull and cross-bones. Could he laugh
1028,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,As mother laughed? No more! He tried to find
1029,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,The mother's laugh and secret for the laugh
1030,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Which kept her to the end--but did she laugh?
1031,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Or if she laughed, was it so hollow, forced"
1032,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,As all his laughter now was. He had proved
1033,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Too much for laughter. Nothing but himself
1034,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Remained to keep himself, he lived alone"
1035,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Upon his stored up fat, now daily growing"
1036,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,To dangerous thinness.
1037,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,
1038,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,So with love of woman.
1039,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"He had found ""thou"" the jug of wine as well,"
1040,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"""Thou"" ""thou"" had come and gone too many times."
1041,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"For what is sex but touch of flesh, the hand"
1042,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Is flesh and hands may touch, if so, the loins--"
1043,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Reductio ad absurdum, O you fools,"
1044,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Who see a wrong in touch of loins, no wrong"
1045,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"In clasp of hands. And so again, again"
1046,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,With his own tools of thought he bruised his hands
1047,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Until they grew too callous to perceive
1048,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,When they were touched.
1049,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,
1050,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,So by analysis
1051,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,He turned on everything he once believed.
1052,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Let's make an end!
1053,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,
1054,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Men thought Excluded Middle
1055,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Was born for great things. Why that bulging brow
1056,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And analytic keen if not for greatness?
1057,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,
1058,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,In those old days they thought so when he fought
1059,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"For lofty things, a youthful radical"
1060,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Come here to change the world! But now at last
1061,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,He lectures in back halls to youths who are
1062,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"What he was in his youth, to acid souls"
1063,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Who must have bitterness, can take enough"
1064,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"To kill a healthy soul, as fiends for dope"
1065,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Must have enough to kill a body clean.
1066,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And so upon a night Excluded Middle
1067,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Is lecturing to prove that life is evil,"
1068,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Not worth the living--when his auditors
1069,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Behold him pale and sway and take his seat,"
1070,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And later quit the hall, the lecture left"
1071,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Half finished.
1072,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,
1073,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,This had happened in a twinkling:
1074,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"He had made life a punching bag, with fists,"
1075,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Excluded Middle and Reductio,"
1076,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Had whacked it back and forth. But just as often
1077,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,As he had struck it with an argument
1078,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"That it is not worth living, snap, the bag"
1079,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Would fly back for another punch. For life
1080,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Just like a punching bag will stand your whacks
1081,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Of hatred and denial, let you punch"
1082,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Almost at will. But sometime, like the bag,"
1083,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"The strap gives way, the bag flies up and falls"
1084,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And lies upon the floor, you've knocked it out."
1085,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And this is what Excluded Middle does
1086,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"This night, the strap breaks with his blows. He proves"
1087,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"His strength, his case and for the first he sees"
1088,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Life is not worth the living. Life gives up,"
1089,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Resists no more, flys back no more to him,"
1090,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"But hits the ceiling, snap the strap gives way!"
1091,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"The bag falls to the floor, and lies there still--"
1092,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Who now shall pick it up, re-fasten it?"
1093,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And so his color fades, it well may be"
1094,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"The crisis of a long neurosis, well"
1095,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,What caused it? But his eyes are wondrous clear
1096,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Perceiving life knocked out. His heart is sick,"
1097,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"He takes his seat, admiring friends swarm round him,"
1098,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Conduct him to a carriage, he goes home"
1099,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,And sitting by the fire (O what is fire?
1100,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"The miracle of fire dawns on his thought,"
1101,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Fire has been near him all these years unseen,"
1102,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,How wonderful is fire!) which warms and soothes
1103,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Neuritic pains, he takes the rubber case"
1104,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Which locks the images of father, mother."
1105,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And as he stares upon the oval brow,"
1106,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"The eyes of blue which flash the light of faith,"
1107,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Preserved like dendrites in this silver shimmer,"
1108,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Some spectral speculations fill his brain,"
1109,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Float like a storm above the sorry wreck
1110,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Of all his logic tools, machines; for now"
1111,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Since pains in back and shoulder like to father's
1112,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Fall to him at the age that father had them,"
1113,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Father has entered him, has settled down"
1114,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,To live with him with those neuritic pangs.
1115,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Thus are his speculations. Over all
1116,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"How comes it that a sudden feel of life,"
1117,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Its wonder, terror, beauty is like father's?"
1118,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,As if the soul of father entered in him
1119,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"And made the field of consciousness his own,"
1120,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Emotions, powers of thought his instruments."
1121,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"That is a horrible atavism, when"
1122,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,You find yourself reverting to a soul
1123,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"You have not loved, despite yourself becoming"
1124,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"That other soul, and with an out-worn self"
1125,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,"Crying for burial on your hands, a life"
1126,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Not yours till now that waits your new found powers--
1127,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,Live now or die indeed!
1128,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,
1129,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,
1130,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,
1131,EXCLUDED MIDDLE,
1132,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.
1133,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,
1134,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,
1135,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Let me consider your emergence
1136,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,From the milieu of our youth:
1137,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"We have played all the afternoon, grown hungry."
1138,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"No meal has been prepared, where have you been?"
1139,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Toward sun's decline we see you down the path,"
1140,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"And run to meet you, and perhaps you smile,"
1141,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Or take us in your arms. Perhaps again
1142,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"You look at us, say nothing, are absorbed,"
1143,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Or chide us for our dirty frocks or faces.
1144,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Of running wild without our meals
1145,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,You do not speak.
1146,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,
1147,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Then in the house, seized with a sudden joy,"
1148,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"After removing gloves and hat, you run,"
1149,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"As with a winged descending flight, and cry,"
1150,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Half song, half exclamation,"
1151,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Seize one of us,"
1152,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Crush one of us with mad embraces, bite"
1153,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Ears of us in a rapture of affection.
1154,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"""You shall have supper,"" then you say."
1155,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"The stove lids rattle, wood's poked in the fire,"
1156,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"The kettle steams, pots boil, by seven o'clock"
1157,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,We sit down to a meal of hodge-podge stuff.
1158,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,I understand now how your youth and spirits
1159,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Fought back the drabness of the village,"
1160,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,And wonder not you spent the afternoons
1161,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,With such bright company as Eugenia Turner--
1162,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"And I forgive you hunger, loneliness."
1163,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,
1164,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"But when we asked you where you'd been,"
1165,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Complained of loneliness and hunger, spoke of children"
1166,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Who lived in order, sat down thrice a day"
1167,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"To cream and porridge, bread and meat."
1168,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,We think to corner you--alas for us!
1169,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Your anger flashes swords! Reasons pour out
1170,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Like anvil sparks to justify your way:
1171,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"""Your father's always gone--you selfish children,"
1172,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"You'd have me in the house from morn till night."""
1173,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,You put us in the wrong--our cause is routed.
1174,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"We turn to bed unsatisfied in mind,"
1175,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"You've overwhelmed us, not convinced us."
1176,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Our sense of wrong defeat breeds resolution
1177,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,To whip you out when minds grow strong.
1178,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,
1179,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Up in the moon-lit room without a light,"
1180,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"(The lamps have not been filled,)"
1181,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,We crawl in unmade beds.
1182,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,We leave you pouring over paper backs.
1183,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,We peek above your shoulder.
1184,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"It is ""The Lady in White"" you read."
1185,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Next morning you are dead for sleep,"
1186,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,You've sat up more than half the night.
1187,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"We have been playing hours when you arise,"
1188,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"It's nine o'clock when breakfast's served at last,"
1189,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,When school days come I'm always late to school.
1190,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,
1191,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Shy, hungry children scuffle at your door,"
1192,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Eye through the crack, maybe, at nine o'clock,"
1193,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Find father has returned during the night.
1194,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"You are all happiness, his idlest word"
1195,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Provokes your laughter.
1196,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,He shows us rolls of precious money earned;
1197,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"He's given you a silk dress, money too"
1198,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,For suits and shoes for us--all is forgiven.
1199,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"You run about the house,"
1200,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,As with a winged descending flight and cry
1201,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Half song, half exclamation."
1202,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,
1203,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,We're sick so much. But then no human soul
1204,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Could be more sweet when one of us is sick.
1205,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"We run to colds, have measles, mumps, our throats"
1206,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Are weak, the doctor says. If rooms were warmer,"
1207,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"And clothes were warmer, food more regular,"
1208,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"And sleep more regular, it might be different."
1209,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Then there's the well. You fear the water.
1210,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"He laughs at you, we children drink the water,"
1211,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Though it tastes bitter, shows white particles:"
1212,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,It may be shreds of rats drowned in the well.
1213,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"The village has no drainage, blights and mildews"
1214,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Get in our throats. I spend a certain spring
1215,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Bent over, yellow, coughing blood at times,"
1216,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Sick to somnambulistic sense of things.
1217,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"You blame him for the well, that's just one thing."
1218,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,You seem to differ about everything--
1219,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,You seem to hate each other--when you quarrel
1220,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"We cry, take sides, sometimes are whipped"
1221,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,For taking sides.
1222,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,
1223,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Our broken school days lose us clues,"
1224,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Some lesson has been missed, the final meaning"
1225,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,And wholeness of the grammar are disturbed--
1226,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,That shall not be made up in all our life.
1227,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"The children, save a few, are not our friends,"
1228,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Some taunt us with your quarrels.
1229,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,We learn great secrets scrawled in signs or words
1230,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Of foulness on the fences. So it is
1231,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"An American village, in a great Republic,"
1232,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Where men are free, where therefore goodness, wisdom"
1233,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Must have their way!
1234,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,
1235,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,We reach the budding age.
1236,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Sweet aches are in our breasts:
1237,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Is it spring, or God, or music, is it you?"
1238,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"I am all tenderness for you at times,"
1239,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Then hate myself for feeling so, my flesh"
1240,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Crawls by an instinct from you. You repel me
1241,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Sometimes with an insidious smile, a look."
1242,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,What are these phantasies I have? They breed
1243,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Strange hatred for you, even while I feel"
1244,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"My soul's home is with you, must be with you"
1245,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,To find my soul's rest. ...
1246,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,
1247,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,I must go back a little. At ten years
1248,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,I play with Paula.
1249,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"I plait her crowns of flowers, carry her books,"
1250,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Defend her, watch her, choose her in the games."
1251,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,You overhear us under the oak tree
1252,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Calling her doll our child. You catch my coat
1253,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,And draw me in the house.
1254,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,When I resist you whip me cruelly.
1255,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"To think of whipping me at such time,"
1256,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,And mix the shame of smarting legs and back
1257,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,With love of Paula!
1258,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,So I lose Paula.
1259,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,
1260,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,I am a man at last.
1261,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,I now can master what you are and see
1262,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"What you have been. You cannot rout me now,"
1263,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Or put me in the wrong. Out of old wounds,"
1264,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Remembrance of your baffling days,"
1265,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,I take great strength and show you
1266,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Where you have been untruthful, where a hater,"
1267,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Where narrow, bitter, growing in on self,"
1268,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Where you neglected us,"
1269,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Where you heaped fast destruction on our father--
1270,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"For now I know that you devoured his soul,"
1271,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,And that no soul that you could not devour
1272,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Could have its peace with you.
1273,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,You've dwindled to a quiet word like this:
1274,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"""You are unfilial."" Which means at last"
1275,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"That I have conquered you, at least it means"
1276,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,That you could not devour me.
1277,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,
1278,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Yet am I blind to you? Let me confess
1279,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,You are the world's whole cycle in yourself:
1280,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,You can be summer rich and luminous;
1281,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"You can be autumn, mellow, mystical;"
1282,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,You can be winter with a cheerful hearth;
1283,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"You can be March, bitter, bright and hard,"
1284,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Pouring sharp sleet, and showering cutting hail;"
1285,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"You can be April of the flying cloud,"
1286,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,And intermittent sun and musical air.
1287,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"I am not you while being you,"
1288,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,While finding in myself so much of you.
1289,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"It tears my other self, which is not you."
1290,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,My tragedy is this: I do not love you.
1291,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Your tragedy is this: my other self
1292,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Which triumphs over you, you hate at heart."
1293,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Your solace is you have no faith in me.
1294,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,
1295,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"All quiet now, no March days with you now,"
1296,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Only the soft coals slumbering in your face,"
1297,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,I saw you totter over a ravine!
1298,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Your eyes averted, watching steps,"
1299,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,A light of resignation on your brow.
1300,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Your thin-spun hair all gray, blown by the wind"
1301,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Which swayed the blossomed cherry trees,"
1302,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Bent last year's reeds,"
1303,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Shook early dandelions, and tossed a bird"
1304,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,That left a branch with song--
1305,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,I saw you totter over a ravine!
1306,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,
1307,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,What were you at the start?
1308,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"What soul dissatisfaction, sense of wrong,"
1309,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Of being thwarted, stung you?"
1310,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,What was your shrinking of the flesh;
1311,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"What fear of being soiled, misunderstood,"
1312,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,What wrath for loneliness which constant hope
1313,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Saw turned to fine companionship;
1314,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"What in your marriage, what in seeing me,"
1315,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"The fruit of marriage, recreated traits"
1316,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,Of face or spirit which you loathed;
1317,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"What in your father and your mother,"
1318,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"And in the chromosomes from which you grew,"
1319,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,By what mitosis could result at last
1320,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"In you, in issues of such moment,"
1321,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"In our dissevered beings,"
1322,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,In what the world will take from me
1323,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"In children, in events?"
1324,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"All quiet now, no March days with you now,"
1325,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"Only the soft coals slumbering in your face,"
1326,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,"I saw you totter over a ravine,"
1327,SAMUEL BUTLER ET AL.,And back of you the Furies!

1333,JOHNNY APPLESEED,
1334,JOHNNY APPLESEED,When the air of October is sweet and cold as the wine of apples
1335,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"Hanging ungathered in frosted orchards along the Grand River,"
1336,JOHNNY APPLESEED,I take the road that winds by the resting fields and wander
1337,JOHNNY APPLESEED,From Eastmanville to Nunica down to the Villa Crossing.
1338,JOHNNY APPLESEED,
1339,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"I look for old men to talk with, men as old as the orchards,"
1340,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"Men to tell me of ancient days, of those who built and planted,"
1341,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"Lichen gray, branch broken, bent and sighing,"
1342,JOHNNY APPLESEED,Hobbling for warmth in the sun and for places to sit and smoke.
1343,JOHNNY APPLESEED,
1344,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"For there is a legend here, a tale of the croaking old ones"
1345,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"That Johnny Appleseed came here, planted some orchards around here,"
1346,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"When nothing was here but the pine trees, oaks and the beeches,"
1347,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"And nothing was here but the marshes, lake and the river."
1348,JOHNNY APPLESEED,
1349,JOHNNY APPLESEED,Peter Van Zylen is ninety and this he tells me:
1350,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"My father talked with Johnny Appleseed there on the hill-side,"
1351,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"There by the road on the way to Fruitport, saw him"
1352,JOHNNY APPLESEED,Clearing pines and oaks for a place for an apple orchard.
1353,JOHNNY APPLESEED,
1354,JOHNNY APPLESEED,Peter Van Zylen says: He got that name from the people
1355,JOHNNY APPLESEED,For carrying apple-seed with him and planting orchards
1356,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"All the way from Ohio, through Indiana across here,"
1357,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"Planting orchards, they say, as far as Illinois."
1358,JOHNNY APPLESEED,
1359,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"Johnny Appleseed said, so my father told me:"
1360,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"I go to a place forgotten, the orchards will thrive and be here"
1361,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"For children to come, who will gather and eat hereafter."
1362,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"And few will know who planted, and none will understand."
1363,JOHNNY APPLESEED,
1364,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"I laugh, said Johnny Appleseed: Some fellow buys this timber"
1365,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"Five years, perhaps from to-day, begins to clear for barley."
1366,JOHNNY APPLESEED,And here in the midst of the timber is hidden an apple orchard.
1367,JOHNNY APPLESEED,How did it come here? Lord! Who was it here before me?
1368,JOHNNY APPLESEED,
1369,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"Yes, I was here before him, to make these places of worship,"
1370,JOHNNY APPLESEED,Labor and laughter and gain in the late October.
1371,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"Why did I do it, eh? Some folks say I am crazy."
1372,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"Where do my labors end? Far west, God only knows!"
1373,JOHNNY APPLESEED,
1374,JOHNNY APPLESEED,Said Johnny Appleseed there on the hill-side: Listen!
1375,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"Beware the deceit of nurseries, sellers of seeds of the apple."
1376,JOHNNY APPLESEED,Think! You labor for years in trees not worth the raising.
1377,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"You planted what you knew not, bitter or sour for sweet."
1378,JOHNNY APPLESEED,
1379,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"No luck more bitter than poor seed, but one as bitter:"
1380,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"The planting of perfect seed in soil that feeds and fails,"
1381,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"Nourishes for a little, and then goes spent forever."
1382,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"Look to your seed, he said, and remember the soil."
1383,JOHNNY APPLESEED,
1384,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"And after that is the fight: the foe curled up at the root,"
1385,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"The scale that crumples and deadens, the moth in the blossoms"
1386,JOHNNY APPLESEED,Becoming a life that coils at the core of a thing of beauty:
1387,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"You bite your apple, a worm is crushed on your tongue!"
1388,JOHNNY APPLESEED,
1389,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"And it's every bit the truth, said Peter Van Zylen."
1390,JOHNNY APPLESEED,So many things love an apple as well as ourselves.
1391,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"A man must fight for the thing he loves, to possess it:"
1392,JOHNNY APPLESEED,"Apples, freedom, heaven, said Peter Van Zylen."

1400,THE LOOM,"My brother, the god, and I grow sick"
1401,THE LOOM,Of heaven's heights.
1402,THE LOOM,We plunge to the valley to hear the tick
1403,THE LOOM,Of days and nights.
1404,THE LOOM,We walk and loiter around the Loom
1405,THE LOOM,"To see, if we may,"
1406,THE LOOM,The Hand that smashes the beam in the gloon
1407,THE LOOM,To the shuttle's play;
1408,THE LOOM,"Who grows the wool, who cards and spins,"
1409,THE LOOM,Who clips and ties;
1410,THE LOOM,"For the storied weave of the Gobelins,"
1411,THE LOOM,Who draughts and dyes.
1412,THE LOOM,
1413,THE LOOM,But whether you stand or walk around
1414,THE LOOM,You shall but hear
1415,THE LOOM,"A murmuring life, as it were the sound"
1416,THE LOOM,Of bees or a sphere.
1417,THE LOOM,"No Hand is seen, but still you may feel"
1418,THE LOOM,"A pulse in the thread,"
1419,THE LOOM,And thought in every lever and wheel
1420,THE LOOM,"Where the shuttle sped,"
1421,THE LOOM,"Dripping the colors, as crushed and urged--"
1422,THE LOOM,Is it cochineal?--
1423,THE LOOM,"Shot from the shuttle, woven and merged"
1424,THE LOOM,A tale to reveal.
1425,THE LOOM,Woven and wound in a bolt and dried
1426,THE LOOM,As it were a plan.
1427,THE LOOM,Closer I looked at the thread and cried
1428,THE LOOM,The thread is man!
1429,THE LOOM,
1430,THE LOOM,"Then my brother curious, strong and bold,"
1431,THE LOOM,Tugged hard at the bolt
1432,THE LOOM,Of the woven life; for a length unrolled
1433,THE LOOM,The cryptic cloth.
1434,THE LOOM,"He gasped for labor, blind for the moult"
1435,THE LOOM,Of the up-winged moth.
1436,THE LOOM,While I saw a growth and a mad crusade
1437,THE LOOM,That the Loom had made;
1438,THE LOOM,"Land and water and living things,"
1439,THE LOOM,Till I grew afraid
1440,THE LOOM,"For mouths and claws and devil wings,"
1441,THE LOOM,"And fangs and stings,"
1442,THE LOOM,And tiger faces with eyes of hell
1443,THE LOOM,In caves and holes.
1444,THE LOOM,And eyes in terror and terrible
1445,THE LOOM,For awakened souls.
1446,THE LOOM,
1447,THE LOOM,"I stood above my brother, the god"
1448,THE LOOM,Unwinding the roll.
1449,THE LOOM,And a tale came forth of the woven slain
1450,THE LOOM,"Sequent and whole,"
1451,THE LOOM,"Of flint and bronze, trowel and hod,"
1452,THE LOOM,"The wheel and the plane,"
1453,THE LOOM,The carven stone and the graven clod
1454,THE LOOM,Painted and baked.
1455,THE LOOM,"And cromlechs, proving the human heart"
1456,THE LOOM,Has always ached;
1457,THE LOOM,Till it puffed with blood and gave to art
1458,THE LOOM,The dream of the dome;
1459,THE LOOM,Till it broke and the blood shot up like fire
1460,THE LOOM,In tower and spire.
1461,THE LOOM,
1462,THE LOOM,"And here was the Persian, Jew and Goth"
1463,THE LOOM,In the weave of the cloth;
1464,THE LOOM,"Greek and Roman, Ghibelline, Guelph,"
1465,THE LOOM,Angel and elf.
1466,THE LOOM,"They were dyed in blood, tangled in dreams"
1467,THE LOOM,Like a comet's streams.
1468,THE LOOM,And here were surfaces red and rough
1469,THE LOOM,"In the finished stuff,"
1470,THE LOOM,Where the knotted thread was proud and rebelled
1471,THE LOOM,As the shuttle proved
1472,THE LOOM,The fated warp and woof that held
1473,THE LOOM,When the shuttle moved;
1474,THE LOOM,And pressed the dye which ran to loss
1475,THE LOOM,In a deep maroon
1476,THE LOOM,"Around an altar, oracle, cross"
1477,THE LOOM,Or a crescent moon.
1478,THE LOOM,"Around a face, a thought, a star"
1479,THE LOOM,In a riot of war!
1480,THE LOOM,
1481,THE LOOM,"Then I said to my brother, the god, let be,"
1482,THE LOOM,"Though the thread be crushed,"
1483,THE LOOM,And the living things in the tapestry
1484,THE LOOM,Be woven and hushed;
1485,THE LOOM,"The Loom has a tale, you can see, to tell,"
1486,THE LOOM,And a tale has told.
1487,THE LOOM,I love this Gobelin epical
1488,THE LOOM,Of scarlet and gold.
1489,THE LOOM,If the heart of a god may look in pride
1490,THE LOOM,At the wondrous weave
1491,THE LOOM,It is something better to Hands which guide--
1492,THE LOOM,I see and believe.

1548,JACK,Some twenty stories up. I think you're right.
1549,JACK,
1550,FLORENCE,FLORENCE
1551,FLORENCE,
1552,FLORENCE,"Say, Jack, what is the matter? Come! be gay."
1553,FLORENCE,Tell me some stories. Buy another bottle.
1554,FLORENCE,"Just think you make a lot of money, Jack."
1555,FLORENCE,You're young and prominent. They all know you.
1556,FLORENCE,I hear your name all over town. I see
1557,FLORENCE,Your picture in the papers. What's the matter?
1558,FLORENCE,
1559,JACK,JACK
1560,JACK,
1561,JACK,I've lost my job for one thing.
1562,JACK,
1563,FLORENCE,FLORENCE
1564,FLORENCE,
1565,FLORENCE,You don't mean it!
1566,FLORENCE,
1567,JACK,JACK
1568,JACK,
1569,JACK,"They used me and then fired me, same as you."
1570,JACK,"If you don't make the money, out you go."
1571,JACK,
1572,FLORENCE,FLORENCE
1573,FLORENCE,
1574,FLORENCE,"Yes, out I go. But, there are other places."
1575,FLORENCE,
1576,JACK,JACK
1577,JACK,
1578,JACK,On further down the street.
1579,JACK,
1580,FLORENCE,FLORENCE
1581,FLORENCE,
1582,FLORENCE,Not yet a while.
1583,FLORENCE,
1584,JACK,JACK
1585,JACK,
1586,JACK,"Not yet for me, but still the question is"
1587,JACK,"Whether to fight it out for up or down,"
1588,JACK,"Or run from everything, be free."
1589,JACK,
1590,FLORENCE,FLORENCE
1591,FLORENCE,
1592,FLORENCE,You can't do that.
1593,FLORENCE,
1594,JACK,JACK
1595,JACK,
1596,JACK,Why not?
1597,JACK,
1598,FLORENCE,FLORENCE
1599,FLORENCE,
1600,FLORENCE,No more than I.
1601,FLORENCE,"Oh well perhaps, if a nice man came by"
1602,FLORENCE,To marry me then I could get away.
1603,FLORENCE,It happens all the time. Last week in fact
1604,FLORENCE,Christ Perko married Rachel who lived here.
1605,FLORENCE,He's rich as cream.
1606,FLORENCE,
1607,JACK,JACK
1608,JACK,
1609,JACK,What corresponds to marriage
1610,JACK,To take me from slavery?
1611,JACK,
1612,FLORENCE,FLORENCE
1613,FLORENCE,
1614,FLORENCE,Money is everything.
1615,FLORENCE,
1616,JACK,JACK
1617,JACK,
1618,JACK,"Yes, everything and nothing."
1619,JACK,"Christ Perko's rich, Christ Perko runs this house,"
1620,JACK,The madam merely acts as figure-head;
1621,JACK,Keeps check upon the girls and on the wine.
1622,JACK,"She's just the editor, and yet I'd rather"
1623,JACK,Be editor than owner. I was editor.
1624,JACK,"My Perko was the owner of a pulp mill,"
1625,JACK,"Incorporate through some multi-millionaires,"
1626,JACK,"And all our lesser writers were the girls,"
1627,JACK,Like you and Rachel.
1628,JACK,
1629,FLORENCE,FLORENCE
1630,FLORENCE,
1631,FLORENCE,But you know before
1632,FLORENCE,"He married Rachel, he was lover to"
1633,FLORENCE,The madam here.
1634,FLORENCE,
1635,JACK,JACK
1636,JACK,
1637,JACK,"The stories tally, for"
1638,JACK,The pulp mill took my first assistant editor
1639,JACK,To wife by making him the editor.
1640,JACK,And I was fired just as the madam here
1641,JACK,Lost out with Perko.
1642,JACK,
1643,FLORENCE,FLORENCE
1644,FLORENCE,
1645,FLORENCE,This is growing funny...
1646,FLORENCE,Ahem! I'll ask you something--
1647,FLORENCE,As if I were a youth and you a girl--
1648,FLORENCE,How were you ruined first?
1649,FLORENCE,
1650,JACK,JACK
1651,JACK,
1652,JACK,The same as you:
1653,JACK,You ran away from school. It was romance.
1654,JACK,You thought you loved this flashy travelling man.
1655,JACK,"And I--I loved adventure, loved the truth."
1656,JACK,"I wanted to destroy the force called ""They."""
1657,JACK,"There is no ""They""--we're all together here,"
1658,JACK,"And everyone must live, Christ Perko too,"
1659,JACK,"The pulp-mill, the policeman, magistrate,"
1660,JACK,"The alderman, the precinct captain too,"
1661,JACK,"And you the girls, myself the editor,"
1662,JACK,And all the lesser writers. Here we are
1663,JACK,Thrown in one integrated lot. You see
1664,JACK,"There is no ""They,"" except the terms, the thought"
1665,JACK,Which ramifies and vivifies the whole. ...
1666,JACK,"So I came to the city, went to work"
1667,JACK,Reporting for a paper. Having said
1668,JACK,"There is no ""They""--I've freed myself to say"
1669,JACK,"What bitter things I choose. For how they drive you,"
1670,JACK,"And terrify you, mock you, ridicule you,"
1671,JACK,"And call you cub and greenhorn, send you round"
1672,JACK,"To courts and dirty places, make you risk"
1673,JACK,"Your body and your life, and make you watch"
1674,JACK,"The rules about your writing; what's tabooed,"
1675,JACK,"What names are to be cursed or to be praised,"
1676,JACK,"What interests, policies to be subserved,"
1677,JACK,"And what to undermine. So I went through,"
1678,JACK,"Until I had a desk, wrote editorials--"
1679,JACK,"Now said I to myself, I'm free at last."
1680,JACK,"But no, my manager, your madam, mark you,"
1681,JACK,"Kept eye on me, for he was under watch"
1682,JACK,Of some Christ Perko. So my manager
1683,JACK,Blue penciled me when I touched certain subjects.
1684,JACK,"But, as he was a just man, loved me too."
1685,JACK,He gave me things to write where he could let
1686,JACK,"My conscience have full scope, as you might live"
1687,JACK,"In this house where you saw the man you loved,"
1688,JACK,"And no one else, though living in this hell."
1689,JACK,"For I lived in a hell, who saw around me"
1690,JACK,"Such lying, hatred, malice, prostitution."
1691,JACK,And when this offer came to be an editor
1692,JACK,"Of a great magazine, I seemed to feel"
1693,JACK,My courage and my virtue given reward.
1694,JACK,"Now, I should pass on poems, and on stories,"
1695,JACK,Creations of free souls. It was not so.
1696,JACK,The poems and the stories one could see
1697,JACK,"Were written to be sold, to please a taste,"
1698,JACK,"Placate a prejudice, keep still alive"
1699,JACK,"An era dying, ready for the tomb,"
1700,JACK,Already smelling. And that was not all.
1701,JACK,Just as the madam here must make report
1702,JACK,"To Perko, so the magazine had to run"
1703,JACK,"To suit the pulp mill. As the madam here,"
1704,JACK,"Assistant to Christ Perko, must keep friends"
1705,JACK,"With alderman, policemen, magistrates,"
1706,JACK,So I was just a wheel in a machine
1707,JACK,"To keep it running with such larger wheels,"
1708,JACK,"And by them run, of policies, and politics"
1709,JACK,Of State and Nation. Here was I locked in
1710,JACK,And given dope to keep me still lest I
1711,JACK,Cry out and wake the copper-who's the copper
1712,JACK,For such as I was? If he heard me cry
1713,JACK,How could he raid the magazine? If he raided
1714,JACK,Where was the court to take me and the rest--
1715,JACK,"That's it, where is the court?"
1716,JACK,
1717,FLORENCE,FLORENCE
1718,FLORENCE,
1719,FLORENCE,It seems to me
1720,FLORENCE,You're bad as I am.
1721,FLORENCE,
1722,JACK,JACK
1723,JACK,
1724,JACK,I am worse than you:
1725,JACK,I poison minds with thoughts they take as good.
1726,JACK,"I drug an era, make it foul or dull--"
1727,JACK,You only sicken bodies here and there.
1728,JACK,"But you know how it is. You have remorse,"
1729,JACK,"You fight it down, hush it with sophistry."
1730,JACK,"You think about the world, about your fellows:"
1731,JACK,"You see that everyone is selling self,"
1732,JACK,"Little or much somehow. You feed your body,"
1733,JACK,"Try to be hearty, take things as they come."
1734,JACK,"You take athletics, try to keep your strength,"
1735,JACK,"As you hear music, laugh, drink wine, and smoke,"
1736,JACK,Are bathed and coifed to keep your beauty fresh.
1737,JACK,"And through it all the soul's and body's needs,"
1738,JACK,"The pleasures, interests, passions of our life,"
1739,JACK,"The cry that comes from somewhere: ""Live, O Soul,"
1740,JACK,"The time is passing,"" move and claim your strength."
1741,JACK,"Till you forget yourself, forget the boy"
1742,JACK,"And man you were, forget the dreams you had,"
1743,JACK,"The creed you wished to live by--yes, what's worse,"
1744,JACK,"See dreams you had, grown tawdry, see your creed"
1745,JACK,Cracked through and crumbled like a falling house.
1746,JACK,And then you say: What is the difference?
1747,JACK,As you might ask what virtue is and why
1748,JACK,Should woman keep it.
1749,JACK,
1750,JACK,I have reached this place
1751,JACK,"Save for one truth I hold to, shall still hold to:"
1752,JACK,"As long as I have breath: The man who sees not,"
1753,JACK,Or cares not for the Truth that keeps the world
1754,JACK,"From vast disintegration is a brute,"
1755,JACK,And marked for a brute's death--that is his hell.
1756,JACK,'Twas loyalty to this truth that made me lose
1757,JACK,My place as editor. For when they came
1758,JACK,And tried to make me pass an article
1759,JACK,"To poison millions with, I said, ""I won't,"
1760,JACK,"I won't by God. I'll quit before I do."""
1761,JACK,"And then they said, ""You quit,"" and so I quit."
1762,JACK,
1763,FLORENCE,FLORENCE
1764,FLORENCE,
1765,FLORENCE,And so you took to drink and came to me!
1766,FLORENCE,And that's the same as if I came to you
1767,FLORENCE,And used you as an editor. I am nothing
1768,FLORENCE,But just a poor reporter in this house--
1769,FLORENCE,But now I quit.
1770,FLORENCE,
1771,JACK,JACK
1772,JACK,
1773,JACK,"Where are you going, Florence?"
1774,JACK,
1775,FLORENCE,FLORENCE
1776,FLORENCE,
1777,FLORENCE,I'm going to a village or a farm
1778,FLORENCE,"Where I'll get up at six instead of twelve,"
1779,FLORENCE,"Where I'll wear calico instead of silk,"
1780,FLORENCE,And where there'll be no furnace in the house.
1781,FLORENCE,And where the carpet which has kept me here
1782,FLORENCE,And keeps you here as editor is not.
1783,FLORENCE,I'm going to economize my life
1784,FLORENCE,By freeing it of systems which grow rich
1785,FLORENCE,"By using me, and for the privilege"
1786,FLORENCE,Bestow these gaudy clothes and perfumed bed.
1787,FLORENCE,"I hate you now, because I hate my life."
1788,FLORENCE,
1789,JACK,JACK
1790,JACK,
1791,JACK,Wait! Wait a minute.
1792,JACK,
1793,FLORENCE,FLORENCE
1794,FLORENCE,
1795,FLORENCE,"Dinah, call a cab!"
1796,FLORENCE,

1800,SIR GALAHAD,SIR GALAHAD
1801,SIR GALAHAD,
1802,SIR GALAHAD,
1803,SIR GALAHAD,I met Hosea Job on Randolph Street
1804,SIR GALAHAD,"Who said to me: ""I'm going for the train,"
1805,SIR GALAHAD,"I want you with me."""
1806,SIR GALAHAD,
1807,SIR GALAHAD,And it happened then
1808,SIR GALAHAD,"My mind was hard, as muscles of the back"
1809,SIR GALAHAD,Grow hard resisting cold or shock or strain
1810,SIR GALAHAD,"And need the osteopath to be made supple,"
1811,SIR GALAHAD,To give the nerves and streams of life a chance.
1812,SIR GALAHAD,Hosea Job was just the osteopath
1813,SIR GALAHAD,"To loose, relax my mood. And so I said"
1814,SIR GALAHAD,"""All right""--and went."
1815,SIR GALAHAD,
1816,SIR GALAHAD,Hosea was a man
1817,SIR GALAHAD,"Whom nothing touched of danger, or of harm."
1818,SIR GALAHAD,"His life was just a rare-bit dream, where some one"
1819,SIR GALAHAD,Seems like to fall before a truck or train--
1820,SIR GALAHAD,Instead he walks across them. Or you see
1821,SIR GALAHAD,"Shadows of falling things, great buildings topple,"
1822,SIR GALAHAD,Pianos skid like bulls from hellish corners
1823,SIR GALAHAD,And chase the oblivious fool who stands and smiles.
1824,SIR GALAHAD,"The buildings slant and sway like monstrous searchlights,"
1825,SIR GALAHAD,But never touch him. And the mad piano
1826,SIR GALAHAD,"Comes up to him, puts down its angry head,"
1827,SIR GALAHAD,"Runs out a friendly tongue and licks his hand,"
1828,SIR GALAHAD,And lows a symphony.
1829,SIR GALAHAD,
1830,SIR GALAHAD,By which I mean
1831,SIR GALAHAD,"Hosea had some money, and would sign"
1832,SIR GALAHAD,A bond or note for any man who asked him.
1833,SIR GALAHAD,"He'd rent a house and leave it, rent another,"
1834,SIR GALAHAD,"Then rent a farm, move out from town and in."
1835,SIR GALAHAD,He'd have the leases of superfluous places
1836,SIR GALAHAD,"Cancelled some how, was never sued for rent."
1837,SIR GALAHAD,One time he had a fancy he would see
1838,SIR GALAHAD,"South Africa, took ship with a load of mules,"
1839,SIR GALAHAD,First telegraphing home from New Orleans
1840,SIR GALAHAD,He'd be back in the Spring. Likewise he went
1841,SIR GALAHAD,To Klondike with the rush. I think he owned
1842,SIR GALAHAD,More kinds of mining stock than there were mines.
1843,SIR GALAHAD,"He had more quaint, peculiar men for friends"
1844,SIR GALAHAD,Than one could think were living. He believed
1845,SIR GALAHAD,"In every doctrine in its time, that promised"
1846,SIR GALAHAD,Salvation for the world. He took no thought
1847,SIR GALAHAD,"For life or for to-morrow, or for health,"
1848,SIR GALAHAD,"Slept with his windows closed, ate what he wished."
1849,SIR GALAHAD,"And if he cut his finger, let it go."
1850,SIR GALAHAD,"I offered him peroxide once, he laughed."
1851,SIR GALAHAD,And when I asked him if his soul was saved
1852,SIR GALAHAD,"He only said: ""I see things. I lie back"
1853,SIR GALAHAD,And take it easy. Nothing can go wrong
1854,SIR GALAHAD,"In any serious sense."""
1855,SIR GALAHAD,
1856,SIR GALAHAD,So many thought
1857,SIR GALAHAD,"Hosea was a nut, and others thought,"
1858,SIR GALAHAD,That I was just a nut for liking him.
1859,SIR GALAHAD,And what would any man of business say
1860,SIR GALAHAD,"If he knew that I didn't ask a question,"
1861,SIR GALAHAD,But simply went with him to take the train
1862,SIR GALAHAD,That day he asked me.
1863,SIR GALAHAD,
1864,SIR GALAHAD,And the train had gone
1865,SIR GALAHAD,"Five miles or so when I said: ""Where you going?"""
1866,SIR GALAHAD,"Hosea answered, and it made me start--"
1867,SIR GALAHAD,"Hosea answered simply, ""We are going"
1868,SIR GALAHAD,"To see Sir Galahad."""
1869,SIR GALAHAD,
1870,SIR GALAHAD,It made me start
1871,SIR GALAHAD,"To hear Hosea say this, for I thought"
1872,SIR GALAHAD,"He was now really off. But, I looked at him"
1873,SIR GALAHAD,And saw his eyes were sane.
1874,SIR GALAHAD,
1875,SIR GALAHAD,"""Sir Galahad?"
1876,SIR GALAHAD,"Who is Sir Galahad?"""
1877,SIR GALAHAD,
1878,SIR GALAHAD,Hosea answered:
1879,SIR GALAHAD,"""I'm going up to see Sir Galahad,"
1880,SIR GALAHAD,And sound him out about re-entering
1881,SIR GALAHAD,"The game and run for governor again."""
1882,SIR GALAHAD,
1883,SIR GALAHAD,So then I knew he was the man our fathers
1884,SIR GALAHAD,"Worked with and knew and called Sir Galahad,"
1885,SIR GALAHAD,Now in retirement fifteen years or so.
1886,SIR GALAHAD,"Well, I was twenty-five when he was famous."
1887,SIR GALAHAD,"Sir Galahad was forty then, and now"
1888,SIR GALAHAD,Must be some fifty-five while I am forty.
1889,SIR GALAHAD,So flashed across my thought the matter of time
1890,SIR GALAHAD,And ages. So I thought of all he did:
1891,SIR GALAHAD,Of how he went from faith to faith in politics
1892,SIR GALAHAD,"And ran for every office up to governor,"
1893,SIR GALAHAD,"And ran for governor four times or so,"
1894,SIR GALAHAD,And never was elected to an office.
1895,SIR GALAHAD,"He drew more bills to remedy injustice,"
1896,SIR GALAHAD,"Improve the courts, relieve the poor, reform"
1897,SIR GALAHAD,"Administration, than the legislature"
1898,SIR GALAHAD,"Could read, much less digest or understand."
1899,SIR GALAHAD,The people beat him and the leaders flogged him.
1900,SIR GALAHAD,They shut the door against his face until
1901,SIR GALAHAD,He had no place to go except a farm
1902,SIR GALAHAD,"Among the stony hills, and there he went."
1903,SIR GALAHAD,"And thither we were going to see the knight,"
1904,SIR GALAHAD,And call him from his solitude to the fight
1905,SIR GALAHAD,"Against injustice, greed."
1906,SIR GALAHAD,
1907,SIR GALAHAD,So we got off
1908,SIR GALAHAD,"The train at Alden, just a little village"
1909,SIR GALAHAD,Of fifty houses lying beneath the sprawl
1910,SIR GALAHAD,Of hills and hills. And here there was a stillness
1911,SIR GALAHAD,"Made lonelier by an anvil ringing, by"
1912,SIR GALAHAD,A plow-man's voice at intervals.
1913,SIR GALAHAD,
1914,SIR GALAHAD,Here Hosea
1915,SIR GALAHAD,"Engaged a horse and buggy, and we drove"
1916,SIR GALAHAD,And wound about a crooked road between
1917,SIR GALAHAD,Great hills that stood together like the backs
1918,SIR GALAHAD,"Of elephants in a herd, where boulders lay"
1919,SIR GALAHAD,As thick as hail in places. Ruined pines
1920,SIR GALAHAD,Stood like burnt matches. There was one which stuck
1921,SIR GALAHAD,Against a single cloud so white it seemed
1922,SIR GALAHAD,A bursted bale of cotton.
1923,SIR GALAHAD,
1924,SIR GALAHAD,We reached the summit
1925,SIR GALAHAD,"And drove along past orchards, past a field"
1926,SIR GALAHAD,"Level and green, kept like a garden, rich"
1927,SIR GALAHAD,Against the coming harvest. Here we met
1928,SIR GALAHAD,"A scarecrow man, driving a scarecrow horse"
1929,SIR GALAHAD,"Hitched to a wobbly wagon. And we stopped,"
1930,SIR GALAHAD,The scarecrow stopped. The scarecrow and Hosea
1931,SIR GALAHAD,Talked much of people and of farming--I
1932,SIR GALAHAD,"Sat listening, and I gathered from the talk,"
1933,SIR GALAHAD,"And what Hosea told me as we drove,"
1934,SIR GALAHAD,That once this field so level and so green
1935,SIR GALAHAD,"The scarecrow owned. He had cleaned out the stumps,"
1936,SIR GALAHAD,"And tried to farm it, failed, and lost the field,"
1937,SIR GALAHAD,"But raged to lose it, thought he might succeed"
1938,SIR GALAHAD,In further time. Now having lost the field
1939,SIR GALAHAD,"So many years ago, could be a scarecrow,"
1940,SIR GALAHAD,"And drive a scarecrow horse, yet laugh again"
1941,SIR GALAHAD,"And have no care, the sorrow healed."
1942,SIR GALAHAD,
1943,SIR GALAHAD,It seemed
1944,SIR GALAHAD,The clearing of the stumps was scarce a starter
1945,SIR GALAHAD,"Toward a field of profit. For in truth,"
1946,SIR GALAHAD,The soil possessed a secret which the scarecrow
1947,SIR GALAHAD,Never went deep enough to learn about.
1948,SIR GALAHAD,"His problem was all stumps. Not solving that,"
1949,SIR GALAHAD,He sold it to a farmer who out-slaved
1950,SIR GALAHAD,"The busiest bee, but only half succeeded."
1951,SIR GALAHAD,"He tried to raise potatoes, made a failure."
1952,SIR GALAHAD,"He planted it in beans, had half a crop."
1953,SIR GALAHAD,He sowed wheat once and reaped a stack of straw.
1954,SIR GALAHAD,The secret of the soil eluded him.
1955,SIR GALAHAD,"And here Hosea laughed: ""This fellow's failure"
1956,SIR GALAHAD,Was just the thing that gave another man
1957,SIR GALAHAD,The secret of the soil. For he had studied
1958,SIR GALAHAD,The properties of soils and fertilizers.
1959,SIR GALAHAD,And when he heard the field had failed to raise
1960,SIR GALAHAD,"Potatoes, beans and wheat, he simply said:"
1961,SIR GALAHAD,There are other things to raise: the question is
1962,SIR GALAHAD,Whether the soil is suited to the things
1963,SIR GALAHAD,"He tried to raise, or whether it needs building"
1964,SIR GALAHAD,"To raise the things he tried to raise, or whether"
1965,SIR GALAHAD,It must be builded up for anything.
1966,SIR GALAHAD,At least he said the field is clear of stumps.
1967,SIR GALAHAD,"Pass on your field, he said. If I lose out"
1968,SIR GALAHAD,"I'll pass it on. The field is his, he said"
1969,SIR GALAHAD,Who can make something grow.
1970,SIR GALAHAD,
1971,SIR GALAHAD,And so this field
1972,SIR GALAHAD,Of waving wheat along which we were driving
1973,SIR GALAHAD,Was just the very field the scarecrow man
1974,SIR GALAHAD,"Had failed to master, as that other man"
1975,SIR GALAHAD,Had failed to master after him.
1976,SIR GALAHAD,
1977,SIR GALAHAD,Hosea
1978,SIR GALAHAD,Kept talking of this field as we drove on.
1979,SIR GALAHAD,"That field, he said, is economical"
1980,SIR GALAHAD,Of men compared with many fields. You see
1981,SIR GALAHAD,It only used two men. To grub the stumps
1982,SIR GALAHAD,Took all the scarecrow's strength. That other man
1983,SIR GALAHAD,Ran off to Oklahoma from this field.
1984,SIR GALAHAD,I have known fields that ate a dozen men
1985,SIR GALAHAD,In country such as this. The field remains
1986,SIR GALAHAD,And laughs and waits for some one who divines
1987,SIR GALAHAD,The secret of the field. Some farmers live
1988,SIR GALAHAD,"To prove what can't be done, and narrow down"
1989,SIR GALAHAD,The guess of what is possible. It's right
1990,SIR GALAHAD,A certain crop should prosper and another
1991,SIR GALAHAD,"Should fail, and when a farmer tries to raise"
1992,SIR GALAHAD,"A crop before it's time, he wastes himself"
1993,SIR GALAHAD,And wastes the field to try.
1994,SIR GALAHAD,
1995,SIR GALAHAD,We now were climbing
1996,SIR GALAHAD,To higher hills and rockier fields. Hosea
1997,SIR GALAHAD,Had fallen into silence. I was thinking
1998,SIR GALAHAD,"About Sir Galahad, was wondering"
1999,SIR GALAHAD,"Which man he was, the scarecrow, or the farmer"
2000,SIR GALAHAD,"Who didn't know the seed to sow, or whether"
2001,SIR GALAHAD,"He might still prove the farmer raising wheat,"
2002,SIR GALAHAD,Now we were come to give him back the field
2003,SIR GALAHAD,"With all the stumps grubbed out, the secret lying"
2004,SIR GALAHAD,Revealed and ready for the appointed hands.
2005,SIR GALAHAD,
2006,SIR GALAHAD,We passed an orchard growing on a knoll
2007,SIR GALAHAD,"And saw a barn perked on a rocky hill,"
2008,SIR GALAHAD,And near the barn a house. Hosea said:
2009,SIR GALAHAD,"""This is Sir Galahad's."" We tied the horse."
2010,SIR GALAHAD,And we were in the silence of the country
2011,SIR GALAHAD,At mid-day on a day in June. No bird
2012,SIR GALAHAD,"Was singing, fowl was cackling, cow was lowing,"
2013,SIR GALAHAD,No dog was barking. All was summer stillness.
2014,SIR GALAHAD,"We crossed a back-yard past a windlass well,"
2015,SIR GALAHAD,"Dodged under clothes lines through a place of chips,"
2016,SIR GALAHAD,Walked in a path along the house. I said:
2017,SIR GALAHAD,"""Sir Galahad is ploughing, or perhaps"
2018,SIR GALAHAD,"Is mending fences, cutting weeds."" It seemed"
2019,SIR GALAHAD,Too bad to come so far and not to find him.
2020,SIR GALAHAD,"""We'll find him,"" said Hosea. ""Let us sit"
2021,SIR GALAHAD,"Under that tree and wait for him."""
2022,SIR GALAHAD,
2023,SIR GALAHAD,And then
2024,SIR GALAHAD,We turned the corner of the house and there
2025,SIR GALAHAD,"Under a tree an old man sat, his head"
2026,SIR GALAHAD,"Bowed down upon his breast, locked fast in sleep."
2027,SIR GALAHAD,And by his feet a dog half blind and fat
2028,SIR GALAHAD,"Lay dozing, too inert to rise and bark."
2029,SIR GALAHAD,
2030,SIR GALAHAD,"Hosea gripped my arm. ""Be still"" he said."
2031,SIR GALAHAD,"""Let's ask him where Sir Galahad is,"" said I."
2032,SIR GALAHAD,"And then Hosea whispered, ""God forgive me,"
2033,SIR GALAHAD,"I had forgotten, you too have forgotten."
2034,SIR GALAHAD,"The man is old, he's very old. The years"
2035,SIR GALAHAD,Go by unnoticed. Come! Sir Galahad
2036,SIR GALAHAD,"Should sleep and not be waked."""
2037,SIR GALAHAD,
2038,SIR GALAHAD,We tip-toed off
2039,SIR GALAHAD,And hurried back to Alden for the train.
2040,SIR GALAHAD,
2041,SIR GALAHAD,
2042,SIR GALAHAD,
2043,SIR GALAHAD,
2044,ST. DESERET,ST. DESERET
2045,ST. DESERET,
2046,ST. DESERET,"You wonder at my bright round eyes, my lips"
2047,ST. DESERET,Pressed tightly like a venomous rosette.
2048,ST. DESERET,"Thus do me honor by so much, fond wretch,"
2049,ST. DESERET,"And praise my Persian beauty, dulcet voice."
2050,ST. DESERET,"But oh you know me, read me, passion blinds"
2051,ST. DESERET,"Your vision not at all, and you have passion"
2052,ST. DESERET,For me and what I am. How can you be so?
2053,ST. DESERET,"Hold me so bear-like, take my lips with yours,"
2054,ST. DESERET,"Bury your face in these my russet tresses,"
2055,ST. DESERET,"And yet not lose your vision? So I love you,"
2056,ST. DESERET,And fear you too. How idle to deny it
2057,ST. DESERET,To you who know I fear you.
2058,ST. DESERET,
2059,ST. DESERET,Here am I
2060,ST. DESERET,Who answer you what e'er you choose to ask.
2061,ST. DESERET,"You stride about my rooms and open books,"
2062,ST. DESERET,And say when did he give you this? You pick
2063,ST. DESERET,"His photograph from mantels, dressers, drawl"
2064,ST. DESERET,"Out of ironic strength, and smile the while:"
2065,ST. DESERET,"""You did not love this man."" You probe my soul"
2066,ST. DESERET,"About his courtship, how I ran away,"
2067,ST. DESERET,"How he pursued with gifts from city to city,"
2068,ST. DESERET,"Threw bouquets to me from the pit, or stood"
2069,ST. DESERET,
2070,ST. DESERET,"Like Cleopatra's Giant negro guard,"
2071,ST. DESERET,Watchful and waiting at the green-room door.
2072,ST. DESERET,"So, devil, that you are, with needle pricks,"
2073,ST. DESERET,"One little question at a time, you've inked"
2074,ST. DESERET,The story in my flesh. And now at last
2075,ST. DESERET,"You smile and say I killed him. Well, it's true."
2076,ST. DESERET,But what a death he had! Envy him that.
2077,ST. DESERET,Your frigid soul can never win the death
2078,ST. DESERET,I gave him.
2079,ST. DESERET,
2080,ST. DESERET,Listen since you know already
2081,ST. DESERET,All but the subtlest matters. How you laugh!
2082,ST. DESERET,"You know these too? Well, only I can tell them."
2083,ST. DESERET,
2084,ST. DESERET,First 'twas a piteous thing to see a man
2085,ST. DESERET,"So love a woman, see a living thing"
2086,ST. DESERET,So love another. Why he could not touch
2087,ST. DESERET,My hand but that his heart went up ten beats.
2088,ST. DESERET,"His eyes would grow as bright as flames, his breath"
2089,ST. DESERET,Come short when speaking. When he felt my breast
2090,ST. DESERET,Crush soft around him he would reel and walk
2091,ST. DESERET,"Away from me, while I stood like a snake"
2092,ST. DESERET,"Poised for the strike, as quiet and possessed"
2093,ST. DESERET,"As a dead breeze. And you can have me wholly,"
2094,ST. DESERET,"And pet and pat me like a favored child,"
2095,ST. DESERET,"And let me go my way, while you turn back"
2096,ST. DESERET,To what you left for me.
2097,ST. DESERET,
2098,ST. DESERET,Not so with him:
2099,ST. DESERET,"I was all through his blood, had made his flesh"
2100,ST. DESERET,"My flesh, his nerves, brain, soul all mine at last,"
2101,ST. DESERET,"Dreams, thoughts, emotions, hungers all my own."
2102,ST. DESERET,"So that he lived two lives, his own and mine,"
2103,ST. DESERET,"With one poor body, which he gave to me."
2104,ST. DESERET,Save that he could not give what I pushed back
2105,ST. DESERET,Into his hands to use for me and live
2106,ST. DESERET,"My pities, hatreds, loves and passions with."
2107,ST. DESERET,"I loved all this and thrived upon it, still"
2108,ST. DESERET,I did not love him. Then why marry him?
2109,ST. DESERET,Why don't you see? It meant so much to him.
2110,ST. DESERET,And 'twas a little thing for me to do.
2111,ST. DESERET,"His loneliness, his hunger, his great passion"
2112,ST. DESERET,"That showed in his poor eyes, his broken breath,"
2113,ST. DESERET,"His chivalry, his gifts, his poignant letters,"
2114,ST. DESERET,"His failing health, why even woman's cruelty"
2115,ST. DESERET,Cannot deny such passion. Woman's cruelty
2116,ST. DESERET,Takes other means for finding its expression.
2117,ST. DESERET,And mine found its expression--you have guessed
2118,ST. DESERET,And so I tell you all.
2119,ST. DESERET,
2120,ST. DESERET,We were married then.
2121,ST. DESERET,"He made a sacrament of our nuptials,"
2122,ST. DESERET,"Knelt with closed eyes beside the bed, my lips"
2123,ST. DESERET,Pressed to his brow and throat. Unveiled my breast
2124,ST. DESERET,"And looked, then closed his eyes. He did not take me"
2125,ST. DESERET,"As man takes his possession, nature's way,"
2126,ST. DESERET,"In triumph of life, in lightning, no, he came"
2127,ST. DESERET,"A suppliant, a worshipper, and whispered:"
2128,ST. DESERET,"""What angel child may lie upon the breast"
2129,ST. DESERET,"Of this it's angel mother."""
2130,ST. DESERET,
2131,ST. DESERET,"Well, you see"
2132,ST. DESERET,"The tears came in my eyes, for pity of him,"
2133,ST. DESERET,"Who made so much of what I had to give,"
2134,ST. DESERET,And could give easily whether 'twas my rapture
2135,ST. DESERET,To give or to withhold. And in that moment
2136,ST. DESERET,Contempt of which I had been scarcely conscious
2137,ST. DESERET,Lying diffused like dew around my heart
2138,ST. DESERET,Drained down itself into my heart's dark cup
2139,ST. DESERET,"To one bright drop of vital power, where"
2140,ST. DESERET,"He could not see it, scarcely knew that something"
2141,ST. DESERET,Gradually drugged the potion that he drank
2142,ST. DESERET,In life with me.
2143,ST. DESERET,
2144,ST. DESERET,"So we were wed a year,"
2145,ST. DESERET,"And he was with me hourly, till at last"
2146,ST. DESERET,"I could not breathe for him, while he could breathe"
2147,ST. DESERET,No where but where I was. Then the bazaar
2148,ST. DESERET,"Was coming on where I was to dance, and he"
2149,ST. DESERET,Had long postponed a trip to England where
2150,ST. DESERET,"Great interests waited for him, and with kisses"
2151,ST. DESERET,"I pushed him to his duty, and he went"
2152,ST. DESERET,"Shame stricken for a duty long postponed,"
2153,ST. DESERET,Unable to retort against my words
2154,ST. DESERET,"When I said ""You must go;"" for well he knew"
2155,ST. DESERET,He should have gone before. And as for going
2156,ST. DESERET,"I pleaded the bazaar and hate of travel,"
2157,ST. DESERET,"And got him off, and freed myself to breathe."
2158,ST. DESERET,
2159,ST. DESERET,"His life had been too fast, his years too many"
2160,ST. DESERET,To stand the strain that came. There was the worry
2161,ST. DESERET,"About the business, and the labor over it."
2162,ST. DESERET,"There was the war, and all the fear and turmoil"
2163,ST. DESERET,In London for the war. But most of all
2164,ST. DESERET,There was the separation. And his letters!
2165,ST. DESERET,"You've read them, wretch. Such letters never were"
2166,ST. DESERET,Of aching loneliness and pining love
2167,ST. DESERET,"And hope that lives across three thousand miles,"
2168,ST. DESERET,"And waits the day to travel them, and fear"
2169,ST. DESERET,Of something which may bar the way forever:
2170,ST. DESERET,"A storm, a wreck, a submarine and no day"
2171,ST. DESERET,Without a letter or a cablegram.
2172,ST. DESERET,And look at the endearments--oh you fiend
2173,ST. DESERET,To pick their words to pieces like a botanist
2174,ST. DESERET,Who cuts a flower up for his microscope.
2175,ST. DESERET,And oh myself who let you see these letters.
2176,ST. DESERET,Why did I do it? Rather why is it
2177,ST. DESERET,"You master me, even as I mastered him?"
2178,ST. DESERET,
2179,ST. DESERET,"At last he finished, got his passage back."
2180,ST. DESERET,He had been gone three months. And all these letters
2181,ST. DESERET,"Showed how he starved for me, and scarce could wait"
2182,ST. DESERET,"To take me in his arms again, would choke"
2183,ST. DESERET,With fast and heavy feeding.
2184,ST. DESERET,
2185,ST. DESERET,"Well, you see"
2186,ST. DESERET,The contempt I spoke of which lay long diffused
2187,ST. DESERET,"Like dew around my heart, and which at once"
2188,ST. DESERET,Drained down itself into my heart's dark cup
2189,ST. DESERET,"Grew brighter, bitterer, for this obvious hunger,"
2190,ST. DESERET,"This thirst which could not wait, the piteous trembling."
2191,ST. DESERET,And all the while it seemed he thought his love
2192,ST. DESERET,"Grew sacreder as it grew uncontrolled,"
2193,ST. DESERET,"And marked by trembling, choking, tears and sighs."
2194,ST. DESERET,"This is not love which should be, has no use"
2195,ST. DESERET,In this or any world. And as for me
2196,ST. DESERET,I could not stand it longer. And I thought
2197,ST. DESERET,Of what was best to do: if 'twas not best
2198,ST. DESERET,To kill him as the queen bee kills the mate
2199,ST. DESERET,In rapture's own excess.
2200,ST. DESERET,
2201,ST. DESERET,Then he arrived.
2202,ST. DESERET,"I went to meet him in the car, pretended"
2203,ST. DESERET,The feed pipe broke while I was on the way.
2204,ST. DESERET,I was not at the station when he came.
2205,ST. DESERET,I got back to the house and found him gone.
2206,ST. DESERET,"He had run through the rooms calling my name,"
2207,ST. DESERET,So Mary told me. Then he went around
2208,ST. DESERET,"From place to place, wherever in the village"
2209,ST. DESERET,He thought to find me.
2210,ST. DESERET,
2211,ST. DESERET,"Soon I heard his steps,"
2212,ST. DESERET,"The key in the door, his winded breath, his call,"
2213,ST. DESERET,"His running, stumbling up the stairs, while I"
2214,ST. DESERET,"Stood silent as a shadow in our room,"
2215,ST. DESERET,My round bright eyes grown brighter for the light
2216,ST. DESERET,His life was feeding them. And then he stood
2217,ST. DESERET,"Breathless and trembling in the door-way, stood"
2218,ST. DESERET,"Transfixed with ecstacy, then rushed and caught me"
2219,ST. DESERET,And broke into loud tears.
2220,ST. DESERET,
2221,ST. DESERET,It had to end.
2222,ST. DESERET,One or the other of us had to die.
2223,ST. DESERET,"I could not die but by a violence,"
2224,ST. DESERET,"And he could die by love alone, and love"
2225,ST. DESERET,I gave him to his death.
2226,ST. DESERET,
2227,ST. DESERET,Why tell you details
2228,ST. DESERET,"And ways with which I maddened him, and whipped"
2229,ST. DESERET,The energies of love? You have extracted
2230,ST. DESERET,"The secret in the main, that 'twas from love"
2231,ST. DESERET,"He came to death. His life had been too fast,"
2232,ST. DESERET,His years too many for the daily rapture
2233,ST. DESERET,I gave him after three months' separation.
2234,ST. DESERET,"And so he died one morning, made me free"
2235,ST. DESERET,Of nothing but his presence in the flesh.
2236,ST. DESERET,"His love is on me yet, and its effect."
2237,ST. DESERET,And now you're here to slave me differently--
2238,ST. DESERET,No soul is ever free.
2239,ST. DESERET,
2240,ST. DESERET,

2335,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,Since all things now seem lost or won.
2336,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,And here it is that your face appears!
2337,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,Like a star brushed out from leaves by a breeze
2338,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"When day's in the sky, though evening nears."
2339,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"You are here by a tent with your little brood,"
2340,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,And I approach in a quiet mood
2341,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"And see you, know that the Destinies"
2342,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,Have surrendered you at last.
2343,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"Voice, lips and hands and the light of the eyes."
2344,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,

2346,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,
2347,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,And I who have asked so much discover
2348,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,That you find in me the man and lover
2349,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"You have divined and visualized,"
2350,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,In quiet day dreams. And what is strange
2351,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,Your boy of eight is subtly guised
2352,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,In fleeting looks that half resemble
2353,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,Something in me. Two souls may range
2354,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"Mid this earth's billion souls for life,"
2355,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,And hide their hunger or dissemble.
2356,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"For there are two at least created,"
2357,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"Endowed with alien powers that draw,"
2358,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,And kindred powers that by some law
2359,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"Bind souls as like as sister, brother."
2360,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,There are two at least who are for each other.
2361,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"If we are such, it is not fated"
2362,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"You are for him, howe'er belated"
2363,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,The time's for us.
2364,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,

2366,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,
2367,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,And yet is not the time gone by?
2368,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"Your garden has been planted, dear."
2369,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,And mine with weeds is over-grown.
2370,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,Oh yes! 'tis only late July!
2371,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"We can replant, ere frosts appear,"
2372,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,Gather the blossoms we have sown.
2373,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,And I have preached that hearts should seize
2374,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,The hour that brings realities. ...
2375,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,
2376,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"Yes, I admit it all, we crush"
2377,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,Under our feet the world's contempt.
2378,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"But when I raise the cup, it's blush"
2379,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"Reveals the snake's eyes, there's a hush"
2380,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,While a hand writes upon the wall:
2381,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"Life cannot be re-made, exempt"
2382,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"From life that has been, something's gone"
2383,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"Out of the soil, in life updrawn"
2384,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"To growths that vine, and tangle, crawl,"
2385,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"Withered in part, or gone to seed."
2386,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"'Tis not the same, though you have freed"
2387,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,The soil from what was grown. ...

2390,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,
2391,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,Heaven is but the hour
2392,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,Of the planting of the flower.
2393,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"But heaven is the blossom to be,"
2394,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,Of the one Reality.
2395,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,And heaven cannot undo the once sown ground.
2396,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"But heaven is love in the pursuing,"
2397,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,And in the memory of having found. ...
2398,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,
2399,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,The rocks in the river make light and sound
2400,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,And show that the waters search and move.
2401,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,And what is time but an infinite whole
2402,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"Revealed by the breaks in thought, desire?"
2403,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,To put it away is to know one's soul.
2404,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,Love is music unheard and fire
2405,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,Too rare for eyes; between hurt beats
2406,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"The heart detects it, sees how pure"
2407,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"Its essence is, through heart defeats.--"
2408,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,You are the silence making sure
2409,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,"The sound with which it has to cope,"
2410,HEAVEN IS BUT THE HOUR,My sorrow and as well my hope.

2416,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,
2417,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,
2418,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"You dull Goliaths clothed in coats of blue,"
2419,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Strained and half bursted by the swell of flesh,"
2420,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Topped by Gorilla heads. You Marmoset,"
2421,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Trained scoundrel, taught to question and ensnare,"
2422,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"I hate you, hate your laws and hate your courts."
2423,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Hands off, give me a chair, now let me be."
2424,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,I'll tell you more than you can think to ask me.
2425,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"I love this woman, but what is love to you?"
2426,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,What is it to your laws or courts? I love her.
2427,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"She loves me, if you'd know. I entered her room--"
2428,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"She stood before me naked, shrank a little,"
2429,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Cried out a little, calmed her sudden cry"
2430,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,When she saw amiable passion in my eyes--
2431,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"She loves me, if you'd know. I saw in her eyes"
2432,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,More in those moments than whole hours of talk
2433,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,From witness stands exculpate could make clear
2434,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,My innocence.
2435,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,
2436,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,But if I did a crime
2437,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"My excuse is hunger, hunger for more life."
2438,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Oh what a world, where beauty, rapture, love"
2439,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Are walled in and locked up like coal or food
2440,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,And only may be had by purchasers
2441,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,From whose fat fingers slip the unheeded gold.
2442,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Oh what a world where beauty lies in waste,"
2443,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,While power and freedom skulk with famished lips
2444,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Too tightly pressed for curses.
2445,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,
2446,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"So do men,"
2447,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Save for the thousandth man, deny themselves"
2448,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,And live in meagreness to make sure a life
2449,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Of meagreness by hearth stones long since stale;
2450,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"And live in ways, companionships as fixed"
2451,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,As the geared figures of the Strassburg clock.
2452,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"You wonder at war? Why war lets loose desires,"
2453,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Emotions long repressed. Would you stop war?
2454,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Then let men live. The moral equivalent
2455,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Of war is freedom. Art does not suffice--
2456,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Religion is not life, but life is living."
2457,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,And painted cherries to the hungry thrush
2458,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Is art to life. The artist lived his work.
2459,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,You cannot live his life who love his work.
2460,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,You are the thrush that pecks at painted cherries
2461,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Who hope to live through art. Beer-soaked Goliaths,"
2462,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,The story's coming of her nakedness
2463,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Be patient for a time.
2464,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,
2465,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,All this I learned
2466,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"While painting pictures no one ever bought,"
2467,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Till hunger drove me to this servile work
2468,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"As butler in her father's house, with time"
2469,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,On certain days to walk the galleries
2470,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"And look at pictures, marbles. For I saw"
2471,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,I was not living while I painted pictures.
2472,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"I was not living working for a crust,"
2473,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,I was not living walking galleries:
2474,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,All this was but vicarious life which felt
2475,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Through gazing at the thing the artist made,"
2476,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,In memory of the life he lived himself:
2477,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,As we preserve the fragrance of a flower
2478,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"By drawing off its essence in a bottle,"
2479,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Where color, fluttering leaves, are thrown away"
2480,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,To get the inner passion of the flower
2481,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Extracted to a bottle that a queen
2482,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,May act the flower's part.
2483,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,
2484,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Say what you will,"
2485,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Make laws to strangle life, shout from your pulpits,"
2486,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Your desks of editors, your woolsack benches"
2487,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Where judges sit, that this dull hypocrite,"
2488,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"You call the State, has fashioned life aright--"
2489,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"The secret is abroad, from eye to eye"
2490,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,The secret passes from poor eyes that wink
2491,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"In boredom, in fatigue, in furious strength"
2492,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Roped down or barred, that what the human heart"
2493,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Dreams of and hopes for till the aspiring flame
2494,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Flaps in the guttered candle and goes out,"
2495,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Is love for body and for spirit, love"
2496,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"To satisfy their hunger. Yet what is it,"
2497,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"This earth, this life, what is it but a meadow"
2498,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Where spirits are left free a little while
2499,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Within a little space, so long as strength,"
2500,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Flesh, blood increases to the day of use"
2501,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"As roasts or stews wherewith this witless beast,"
2502,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Society may feed himself and keep
2503,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,His olden shape and power?
2504,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,
2505,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Fools go crop
2506,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"The herbs they turn you to, and starve yourself"
2507,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"For what you want, and count it righteousness,"
2508,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"No less you covet love. Poor shadows sighing,"
2509,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Across the curtain racing! Mangled souls
2510,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Pecking so feebly at the painted cherries,"
2511,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Inhaling from a bottle what was lived
2512,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"These summers gone! You know, and scarce deny"
2513,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"That what we men desire are horses, dogs,"
2514,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Loves, women, insurrections, travel, change,"
2515,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Thrill in the wreck and rapture for the change,"
2516,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,And re-adjusted order.
2517,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,
2518,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,As I turned
2519,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"From painting and from art, yet found myself"
2520,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Full of all lusts while bound to menial work
2521,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Where my eyes daily rested on this woman
2522,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,A thought came to me like a little spark
2523,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"One sees far down the darkness of a cave,"
2524,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Which grows into a flame, a blinding light"
2525,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"As one approaches it, so did this thought"
2526,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Both burn and blind me: For I loved this woman,"
2527,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"I wanted her, why should I lose this woman?"
2528,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,What was there to oppose possession? Will?
2529,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Her will, you say? I am not sure, but then"
2530,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Which will is better, mine or hers? Which will"
2531,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Deserves achievement? Which has rights above
2532,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"The other? I desire her, her desire"
2533,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Is not toward me, which of these two desires"
2534,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Shall triumph? Why not mine for me and hers
2535,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"For her, at least the stronger must prevail,"
2536,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,And wreck itself or bend all else before it.
2537,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"That millionaire who wooed her, tried in vain"
2538,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"To overwhelm her will with gold, and I"
2539,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"With passion, boldness would have overwhelmed it,"
2540,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,And what's the difference?
2541,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,
2542,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,But as I said
2543,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,I walked the galleries. When I stood in the yard
2544,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Bare armed, bare throated at my work, she came"
2545,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,And gazed upon me from her window. I
2546,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Could feel the exhausting influence of her eyes.
2547,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Then in a concentration which was blindness
2548,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"To all else, so bewilderment of mind,"
2549,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,I'd go to see Watteau's Antiope
2550,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Where he sketched Zeus in hunger, drawing back"
2551,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,The veil that hid her sleeping nakedness.
2552,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"There was Correggio's too, on whom a satyr"
2553,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Smiled for his amorous wonder. A Semele,"
2554,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Done by an unknown hand, a thing of lightning"
2555,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Moved through by Zeus who seized her as the flames
2556,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Consumed her ravished beauty.
2557,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,
2558,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"So I looked,"
2559,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"And trembled, then returned perhaps to find"
2560,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Her eyes upon me conscious, calm, elate,"
2561,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"And radiate with lashes of surprise,"
2562,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Delight as when a star is still but shines.
2563,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,And on this night somehow our natures worked
2564,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,To climaxes. For first she dressed for dinner
2565,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,To show more back and bosom than before.
2566,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"And as I served her, her down-looking eyes"
2567,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Were more than glances. Then she dropped her napkin.
2568,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Before I could begin to bend she leaned
2569,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"And let me see--oh yes, she let me see"
2570,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,The white foam of her little breasts caressing
2571,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"The scarlet flame of silk, a swooning shore"
2572,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Of bright carnations. It was from such foam
2573,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,That Venus rose. And as I stooped and gave
2574,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"The napkin to her she pushed out a foot,"
2575,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"And then I coughed for breath grown short, and she"
2576,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Concealed a smile--and you, you jailers laugh"
2577,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Coarse-mouthed, and mock my hunger."
2578,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,
2579,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"I go on,"
2580,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Observe how courage, boldness mark my steps!"
2581,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,At nine o'clock she climbs to her boudoir.
2582,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,I finding errands in the hallway hear
2583,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"The desultory taking up of books,"
2584,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"And through her open door, see her at last"
2585,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Cast off her dinner gown and to the bath
2586,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Step like a ray of moonlight. Then she snaps
2587,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,The light on where the onyx tub and walls
2588,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Dazzle the air. I enter then her room
2589,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"And stand against the closed door, do not pry"
2590,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Upon her in the bath. Give her the chance
2591,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"To fly me, fight me standing face to face."
2592,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"I hear her flounder in the water, hear"
2593,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Hands slap and slip with water breast and arms;
2594,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Hear little sighs and shudders and the roughness
2595,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Of crash towels on her back, when in a minute"
2596,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"She stands with back toward me in the doorway,"
2597,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"A sea-shell glory, pink and white to hair"
2598,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Sun-lit, a lily crowned with powdered gold."
2599,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,She turned toward her dresser then and shook
2600,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"White dust of talcum on her arms, and looked"
2601,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"So lovingly upon her tense straight breasts,"
2602,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Touching them under with soft tapering hands
2603,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,To blue eyes deepening like a brazier flame
2604,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Turned by a sudden gust. Who gives her these,"
2605,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"The thought ran through me, for her joy alone"
2606,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,And not for mine?
2607,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,
2608,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,So I stood there like Zeus
2609,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Coming in thunder to Semele, like"
2610,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,The diety of Watteau. Correggio
2611,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Had never painted me a satyr there
2612,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Drinking her beauty in, so worshipful,"
2613,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,My will subdued in worship of her beauty
2614,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,To obey her will.
2615,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,
2616,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"And then she turned and saw me,"
2617,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"And faced me in her nakedness, nor tried"
2618,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"To hide it from me, faced me immovable"
2619,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,A Mona Lisa smile upon her lips.
2620,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"And let me plead my cause, make known my love,"
2621,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Speak out my torture, wearing still the smile."
2622,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Let me approach her till I almost touched
2623,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,The whiteness of her bosom. Then it seemed
2624,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,That smile of hers not wilting me she clapped
2625,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Hands over eyes and said: ""I am afraid--"
2626,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Oh no, it cannot be--what would they say?"""
2627,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Then rushing in the bathroom, quick she slammed"
2628,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"The door and shrieked: ""You scoundrel, go--you beast."""
2629,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,My dream went up like paper charred and whirled
2630,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Above a hearth. Thrilling I stood alone
2631,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Amid her room and saw my life, our life"
2632,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Embodied in this woman lately there
2633,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Lying and cowardly. And as I turned
2634,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"To leave the room, her father and the gardener"
2635,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"Pounced on me, threw me down a flight of stairs"
2636,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"And turned me over, stunned, to you the law"
2637,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Here with these others who have stolen coal
2638,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,"To keep them warm, as I have stolen beauty"
2639,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,To keep from freezing in this arid country
2640,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Of winter winds on which the dust of custom
2641,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Rides like a fog.
2642,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,
2643,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,Now do your worst to me!
2644,VICTOR RAFOLSKI ON ART,

2675,THE LANDSCAPE,
2676,THE LANDSCAPE,And your paper knight of old
2677,THE LANDSCAPE,Secrets of the landscape told.
2678,THE LANDSCAPE,And the hedge-rows where the pond
2679,THE LANDSCAPE,Took the blue of heavens beyond
2680,THE LANDSCAPE,The hastening clouds of gusty March.
2681,THE LANDSCAPE,There you saw their wrinkled arch
2682,THE LANDSCAPE,Where the East wind cracks his whips
2683,THE LANDSCAPE,Round the little pond and clips
2684,THE LANDSCAPE,Main-sails from your toppled ships. ...
2685,THE LANDSCAPE,
2686,THE LANDSCAPE,Landscape that in youth you knew
2687,THE LANDSCAPE,"Past and present, earth and you!"
2688,THE LANDSCAPE,All the legends and the tales
2689,THE LANDSCAPE,"Of the uplands, of the vales;"
2690,THE LANDSCAPE,Sounds of cattle and the cries
2691,THE LANDSCAPE,Of ploughmen and of travelers
2692,THE LANDSCAPE,Were its soul's interpreters.
2693,THE LANDSCAPE,And here the lame were always lame.
2694,THE LANDSCAPE,Always gray the gray of head.
2695,THE LANDSCAPE,And the dead were always dead
2696,THE LANDSCAPE,Ere the landscape had become
2697,THE LANDSCAPE,"Your cradle, as it was their tomb."
2698,THE LANDSCAPE,
2699,THE LANDSCAPE,*       *       *       *       *
2700,THE LANDSCAPE,
2701,THE LANDSCAPE,And when the thunder storms would waken
2702,THE LANDSCAPE,Of the dream your soul was not forsaken:
2703,THE LANDSCAPE,In the room where the dormer windows look--
2704,THE LANDSCAPE,There were your knight and the tattered book.
2705,THE LANDSCAPE,With colors of the forest green
2706,THE LANDSCAPE,Gabled roofs and the demesne
2707,THE LANDSCAPE,Of faery kingdoms and faery time
2708,THE LANDSCAPE,Storied in pre-natal rhyme. ...
2709,THE LANDSCAPE,"Past the orchards, in the plain"
2710,THE LANDSCAPE,The cattle fed on in the rain.
2711,THE LANDSCAPE,And the storm-beaten horseman sped
2712,THE LANDSCAPE,Rain blinded and with bended head.
2713,THE LANDSCAPE,And John the ploughman comes and goes
2714,THE LANDSCAPE,"In labor wet, with steaming clothes."
2715,THE LANDSCAPE,"This is your landscape, but you see"
2716,THE LANDSCAPE,Not terror and not destiny
2717,THE LANDSCAPE,"Behind its loved, maternal face,"
2718,THE LANDSCAPE,"Its power to change, or fade, replace"
2719,THE LANDSCAPE,"Its wonder with a deeper dream,"
2720,THE LANDSCAPE,Unfolding to a vaster theme.
2721,THE LANDSCAPE,From time eternal was this earth?
2722,THE LANDSCAPE,No less this landscape with your birth
2723,THE LANDSCAPE,"Arose, nor leaves you, nor decay"
2724,THE LANDSCAPE,Finds till the twilight of your day.
2725,THE LANDSCAPE,"It bore you, moulds you to its plan."
2726,THE LANDSCAPE,"It ends with you as it began,"
2727,THE LANDSCAPE,But bears the seed of future years
2728,THE LANDSCAPE,"Of higher raptures, dumber tears."
2729,THE LANDSCAPE,
2730,THE LANDSCAPE,*       *       *       *       *
2731,THE LANDSCAPE,
2732,THE LANDSCAPE,For soon you lose the landscape through
2733,THE LANDSCAPE,"Absence, sorrow, eyes grown true"
2734,THE LANDSCAPE,To the naked limbs which show
2735,THE LANDSCAPE,Buds that never more may blow.
2736,THE LANDSCAPE,Now you know the lame were straight
2737,THE LANDSCAPE,"Ere you knew them, and the fate"
2738,THE LANDSCAPE,Of the old is yet to die.
2739,THE LANDSCAPE,Now you know the dead who lie
2740,THE LANDSCAPE,In the graves you saw where first
2741,THE LANDSCAPE,"The landscape on your vision burst,"
2742,THE LANDSCAPE,"Were not always dead, and now"
2743,THE LANDSCAPE,Shadows rest upon the brow
2744,THE LANDSCAPE,Of the souls as young as you.
2745,THE LANDSCAPE,"Some are gone, though years are few"
2746,THE LANDSCAPE,Since you roamed with them the hills.
2747,THE LANDSCAPE,"So the landscape changes, wills"
2748,THE LANDSCAPE,"All the changes, did it try"
2749,THE LANDSCAPE,Its promises to justify?...
2750,THE LANDSCAPE,
2751,THE LANDSCAPE,*       *       *       *       *
2752,THE LANDSCAPE,
2753,THE LANDSCAPE,For you return and find it bare:
2754,THE LANDSCAPE,There is no heaven of golden air.
2755,THE LANDSCAPE,"Your eyes around the horizon rove,"
2756,THE LANDSCAPE,A clump of trees is Leese's Grove.
2757,THE LANDSCAPE,"And what's the hedgerow, what's the pond?"
2758,THE LANDSCAPE,A wallow where the vagabond
2759,THE LANDSCAPE,"Beast will not drink, and where the arch"
2760,THE LANDSCAPE,Of heaven in the days of March
2761,THE LANDSCAPE,Refrains to look. A blinding rain
2762,THE LANDSCAPE,Beats the once gilded window pane.
2763,THE LANDSCAPE,"John, the poor wretch, is gone, but bread"
2764,THE LANDSCAPE,Tempts other feet that path to tread
2765,THE LANDSCAPE,"Between the barn and house, and brave"
2766,THE LANDSCAPE,The March rain and the winds that rave. ...
2767,THE LANDSCAPE,"O, landscape I am one who stands"
2768,THE LANDSCAPE,Returned with pale and broken hands
2769,THE LANDSCAPE,"Glad for the day that I have known,"
2770,THE LANDSCAPE,And finds the deserted doorway strown
2771,THE LANDSCAPE,With shoulder blade and spinal bone.
2772,THE LANDSCAPE,And you who nourished me and bred
2773,THE LANDSCAPE,I find the spirit from you fled.
2774,THE LANDSCAPE,"You gave me dreams,'twas at your breast"
2775,THE LANDSCAPE,My soul's beginning rose and pressed
2776,THE LANDSCAPE,My steps afar at last and shaped
2777,THE LANDSCAPE,"A world elusive, which escaped"
2778,THE LANDSCAPE,Whatever love or thought could find
2779,THE LANDSCAPE,Beyond the tireless wings of mind.
2780,THE LANDSCAPE,"Yet grown by you, and feeding on"
2781,THE LANDSCAPE,"Your strength as mother, you are gone"
2782,THE LANDSCAPE,"When I return from living, trace"
2783,THE LANDSCAPE,"My steps to see how I began,"
2784,THE LANDSCAPE,And deeply search your mother face
2785,THE LANDSCAPE,"To know your inner self, the place"
2786,THE LANDSCAPE,"For which you bore me, sent me forth"
2787,THE LANDSCAPE,"To wander, south or east or north. ..."
2788,THE LANDSCAPE,Now the familiar landscape lies
2789,THE LANDSCAPE,With breathless breast and hollow eyes.
2790,THE LANDSCAPE,"It knows me not, as I know not"
2791,THE LANDSCAPE,"Its secret, spirit, all forgot"
2792,THE LANDSCAPE,"Its kindred look is, as I stand"
2793,THE LANDSCAPE,A stranger in an unknown land.
2794,THE LANDSCAPE,
2795,THE LANDSCAPE,*       *       *       *       *
2796,THE LANDSCAPE,
2797,THE LANDSCAPE,"Are we not earth-born, formed of dust"
2798,THE LANDSCAPE,Which seeks again its love and trust
2799,THE LANDSCAPE,"In an old landscape, after change"
2800,THE LANDSCAPE,"In hearts grown weary, wrecked and strange?"
2801,THE LANDSCAPE,What though we struggled to emerge
2802,THE LANDSCAPE,"Dividual, footed for the urge"
2803,THE LANDSCAPE,"Of further self-discoveries, though"
2804,THE LANDSCAPE,"In the mid-years we cease to know,"
2805,THE LANDSCAPE,"Through disenchanted eyes, the spell"
2806,THE LANDSCAPE,That clothed it like a miracle--
2807,THE LANDSCAPE,Yet at the last our steps return
2808,THE LANDSCAPE,Its deeper mysteries to learn.
2809,THE LANDSCAPE,"It has been always us, it must"
2810,THE LANDSCAPE,Clasp to itself our kindred dust.
2811,THE LANDSCAPE,We cannot free ourselves from it.
2812,THE LANDSCAPE,Near or afar we must submit
2813,THE LANDSCAPE,"To what is in us, what was grown"
2814,THE LANDSCAPE,"Out of the landscape's soil, the known"
2815,THE LANDSCAPE,And unknown powers of soil and soul.
2816,THE LANDSCAPE,As bodies yield to the control
2817,THE LANDSCAPE,"Of the earth's center, and so bend"
2818,THE LANDSCAPE,"In age, so hearts toward the end"
2819,THE LANDSCAPE,Bend down with lips so long athirst
2820,THE LANDSCAPE,To waters which were known at first--
2821,THE LANDSCAPE,The little spring at Leese's Grove
2822,THE LANDSCAPE,"Was your first love, is your last love!"
2823,THE LANDSCAPE,
2824,THE LANDSCAPE,*       *        *       *       *
2825,THE LANDSCAPE,
2826,THE LANDSCAPE,When those we knew in youth have crept
2827,THE LANDSCAPE,"Under the landscape, which has kept"
2828,THE LANDSCAPE,Nothing we saw with youthful eyes;
2829,THE LANDSCAPE,"Ere God is formed in the empty skies,"
2830,THE LANDSCAPE,I wonder not our steps are pressed
2831,THE LANDSCAPE,Toward the mystery of their rest.
2832,THE LANDSCAPE,That is the hope at bud which kneels
2833,THE LANDSCAPE,Where ancestors the tomb conceals.
2834,THE LANDSCAPE,Age no less than youth would lean
2835,THE LANDSCAPE,Upon some love. For what is seen
2836,THE LANDSCAPE,"No more of father, mother, friend,"
2837,THE LANDSCAPE,"For hands of flesh lost, eyes grown blind"
2838,THE LANDSCAPE,"In death, a something which assures,"
2839,THE LANDSCAPE,"Comforts, allays our fears, endures."
2840,THE LANDSCAPE,Just as the landscape and our home
2841,THE LANDSCAPE,"In childhood made of heaven's dome,"
2842,THE LANDSCAPE,And all the farthest ways of earth
2843,THE LANDSCAPE,A place as sheltered as the hearth.
2844,THE LANDSCAPE,
2845,THE LANDSCAPE,*       *       *       *       *
2846,THE LANDSCAPE,
2847,THE LANDSCAPE,Is it not written at the last day
2848,THE LANDSCAPE,Heaven and earth shall roll away?
2849,THE LANDSCAPE,"Yes, as my landscape passed through death,"
2850,THE LANDSCAPE,"Lay like a corpse, and with new breath"
2851,THE LANDSCAPE,Became instinct with fire and light--
2852,THE LANDSCAPE,"So shall it roll up in my sight,"
2853,THE LANDSCAPE,"Pass from the realm of finite sense,"
2854,THE LANDSCAPE,"Become a thing of spirit, whence"
2855,THE LANDSCAPE,"I shall pass too, its child in faith"
2856,THE LANDSCAPE,"Of dreams it gave me, which nor death"
2857,THE LANDSCAPE,"Nor change can wreck, but still reveal"
2858,THE LANDSCAPE,"In change a Something vast, more real"
2859,THE LANDSCAPE,"Than sunsets, meadows, green-wood trees,"
2860,THE LANDSCAPE,Or even faery presences.
2861,THE LANDSCAPE,A Something which the earth and air
2862,THE LANDSCAPE,Transmutes but keeps them what they were;
2863,THE LANDSCAPE,Clear films of beauty grown more thin
2864,THE LANDSCAPE,As we approach and enter in.
2865,THE LANDSCAPE,Until we reach the scene that made
2866,THE LANDSCAPE,Our landscape just a thing of shade.

2871,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY
2872,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,
2873,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,
2874,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Well, then, another drink! Ben Jonson knows,"
2875,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"So do you, Michael Drayton, that to-morrow"
2876,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"I reach my fifty-second year. But hark ye,"
2877,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,To-morrow lacks two days of being a month--
2878,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Here is a secret--since I made my will.
2879,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Heigh ho! that's done too! I wonder why I did it?
2880,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,That I should make a will! Yet it may be
2881,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,That then and jump at this most crescent hour
2882,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Heaven inspired the deed.
2883,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,
2884,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,As a mad younker
2885,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,I knew an aged man in Warwickshire
2886,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Who used to say, ""Ah, mercy me,"" for sadness"
2887,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Of change, or passing time, or secret thoughts."
2888,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"If it was spring he sighed it, if 'twas fall,"
2889,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"With drifting leaves, he looked upon the rain"
2890,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,And with doleful suspiration kept
2891,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,This habit of his grief. And on a time
2892,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"As he stood looking at the flying clouds,"
2893,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"I loitering near, expectant, heard him say it,"
2894,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Inquired, ""Why do you say 'Ah, mercy me,'"
2895,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Now that it's April?"" So he hobbled off"
2896,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,And left me empty there.
2897,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,
2898,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Now here am I!
2899,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Oh, it is strange to find myself this age,"
2900,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And rustling like a peascod, though unshelled,"
2901,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And, like this aged man of Warwickshire,"
2902,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Slaved by a mood which must have breath--""Tra-la!"
2903,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"That's what I say instead of ""Ah, mercy me."""
2904,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"For look you, Ben, I catch myself with ""Tra-la"""
2905,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,The moment I break sleep to see the day.
2906,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"At work, alone, vexed, laughing, mad or glad"
2907,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"I say, ""Tra-la"" unknowing. Oft at table"
2908,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"I say, ""Tra-la."" And 'tother day, poor Anne"
2909,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Looked long at me and said, ""You say, 'Tra-la'"
2910,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Sometimes when you're asleep; why do you so?"""
2911,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Then I bethought me of that aged man
2912,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Who used to say, ""Ah, mercy me,"" but answered:"
2913,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"""Perhaps I am so happy when awake"
2914,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"The song crops out in slumber--who can say?"""
2915,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And Anne arose, began to keel the pot,"
2916,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"But was she answered, Ben? Who know a woman?"
2917,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,
2918,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"To-morrow is my birthday. If I die,"
2919,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Slip out of this with Bacchus for a guide,"
2920,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,What soul would interdict the poppied way?
2921,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Heroes may look the Monster down, a child"
2922,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Can wilt a lion, who is cowed to see"
2923,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Such bland unreckoning of his strength--but I,"
2924,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Having so greatly lived, would sink away"
2925,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Unknowing my departure. I have died
2926,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"A thousand times, and with a valiant soul"
2927,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Have drunk the cup, but why? In such a death"
2928,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,To-morrow shines and there's a place to lean.
2929,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"But in this death that has no bottom to it,"
2930,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"No bank beyond, no place to step, the soul"
2931,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Grows sick, and like a falling dream we shrink"
2932,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"From that inane which gulfs us, without place"
2933,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,For us to stand and see it.
2934,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,
2935,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Yet, dear Ben,"
2936,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,This thing must be; that's what we live to know
2937,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Out of long dreaming, saying that we know it."
2938,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,As yeasty heroes in their braggart teens
2939,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Spout learnedly of war, who never saw"
2940,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"A cannon aimed. You drink too much to-day,"
2941,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Or get a scratch while turning Lucy's stile,"
2942,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,And like a beast you sicken. Like a beast
2943,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,They cart you off. What matter if your thought
2944,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Outsoared the Phoenix? Like a beast you rot.
2945,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Methinks that something wants our flesh, as we"
2946,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Hunger for flesh of beasts. But still to-morrow,"
2947,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,To-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow
2948,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Creeps in this petty pace--O, Michael Drayton,"
2949,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Some end must be. But 'twixt the fear of ceasing
2950,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,And weariness of going on we lie
2951,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Upon these thorns!
2952,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,
2953,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,These several springs I find
2954,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,No new birth in the Spring. And yet in London
2955,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"I used to cry, ""O, would I were in Stratford;"
2956,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,It's April and the larks are singing now.
2957,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,The flags are green along the Avon river;
2958,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"O, would I were a rambler in the fields."
2959,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,This poor machine is racing to its wreck.
2960,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"This grist of thought is endless, this old sorrow"
2961,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Sprouts, winds and crawls in London's darkness. Come"
2962,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Back to your landscape! Peradventure waits
2963,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Some woman there who will make new the earth,"
2964,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And crown the spring with fire."""
2965,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,
2966,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,So back I come.
2967,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And the springs march before me, say, ""Behold"
2968,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Here are we, and what would you, can you use us?"
2969,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"What good is air if lungs are out, or springs"
2970,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"When the mind's flown so far away no spring,"
2971,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Nor loveliness of earth can call it back?
2972,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,I tell you what it is: in early youth
2973,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,The life is in the loins; by thirty years
2974,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"It travels through the stomach to the lungs,"
2975,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,And then we strut and crow. By forty years
2976,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,The fruit is swelling while the leaves are fresh.
2977,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"By fifty years you're ripe, begin to rot."
2978,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"At fifty-two, or fifty-five or sixty"
2979,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,The life is in the seed--what's spring to you?
2980,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Puff! Puff! You are so winged and light you fly.
2981,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"For every passing zephyr, are blown off,"
2982,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And drifting, God knows where, cry out ""tra-la,"""
2983,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"""Ah, mercy me,"" as it may happen you."
2984,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Puff! Puff! away you go!
2985,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,
2986,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Another drink?
2987,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Why, you may drown the earth with ale and I"
2988,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Will drain it like a sea. The more I drink
2989,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,The better I see that this is April time. ...
2990,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,
2991,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Ben! There is one Voice which says to everything:
2992,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"""Dream what you will, I'll make you bear your seed."
2993,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And, having borne, the sickle comes among ye"
2994,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And takes your stalk."" The rich and sappy greens"
2995,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Of spring or June show life within the loins,"
2996,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And all the world is fair, for now the plant"
2997,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Can drink the level cup of flame where heaven
2998,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Is poured full by the sun. But when the blossom
2999,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Flutters its colors, then it takes the cup"
3000,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,And waves the stalk aside. And having drunk
3001,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"The stalk to penury, then slumber comes"
3002,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"With dreams of spring stored in the imprisoned germ,"
3003,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"An old life and a new life all in one,"
3004,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"A thing of memory and of prophecy,"
3005,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Of reminiscence, longing, hope and fear."
3006,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"What has been ours is taken, what was ours"
3007,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Becomes entailed on our seed in the spring,"
3008,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Fees in possession and enjoyment too. ...
3009,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,
3010,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"The thing is sex, Ben. It is that which lives"
3011,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And dies in us, makes April and unmakes,"
3012,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And leaves a man like me at fifty-two,"
3013,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Finished but living, on the pinnacle"
3014,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Betwixt a death and birth, the earth consumed"
3015,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,And heaven rolled up to eyes whose troubled glances
3016,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Would shape again to something better--what?
3017,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Give me a woman, Ben, and I will pick"
3018,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Out of this April, by this larger art"
3019,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Of fifty-two, such songs as we have heard,"
3020,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Both you and I, when weltering in the clouds"
3021,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Of that eternity which comes in sleep,"
3022,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Or in the viewless spinning of the soul
3023,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"When most intense. The woman is somewhere,"
3024,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And that's what tortures, when I think this field"
3025,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,So often gleaned could blossom once again
3026,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,If I could find her.
3027,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,
3028,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Well, as to my plays:"
3029,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,I have not written out what I would write.
3030,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,They have a thousand buds of finer flowering.
3031,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And over ""Hamlet"" hangs a teasing spirit"
3032,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,As fine to that as sense is fine to flesh.
3033,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Good friends, my soul beats up its prisoned wings"
3034,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Against the ceiling of a vaster whorl
3035,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And would break through and enter. But, fair friends,"
3036,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,What strength in place of sex shall steady me?
3037,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,What is the motive of this higher mount?
3038,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,What process in the making of myself--
3039,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"The very fire, as it were, of my growth--"

3164,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Of every graft and being in myself
3165,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,The recapitulation and the complex

3196,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Commanded my strength's use to abort and slay
3197,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"What grew within me, while I saw the blood"
3198,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Of love untimely ripped, as 'twere a child"
3199,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Killed i' the womb, a harpy or an angel"
3200,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,With my own blood stained.
3201,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,
3202,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,As a virgin shamed
3203,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"By the swelling life unlicensed needles it,"
3204,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,But empties not her womb of some last shred
3205,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Of flesh which fouls the alleys of her body,"
3206,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And fills her wholesome nerves with poisoned sleep,"
3207,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And weakness to the last of life, so I"
3208,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"For some shame not unlike, some need of life"
3209,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,To rid me of this life I had conceived
3210,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Did up and choke it too, and thence begot"
3211,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,A fever and a fixed debility
3212,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,For killing that begot.
3213,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,
3214,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Now you see that I
3215,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Have not grown from a central dream, but grown"
3216,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Despite a wound, and over the wound and used"
3217,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,My flesh to heal my flesh. My love's a fever
3218,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Which longed for that which nursed the malady,"
3219,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And fed on that which still preserved the ill,"
3220,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"The uncertain, sickly appetite to please."
3221,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"My reason, the physician to my love,"
3222,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Angry that his prescriptions are not kept
3223,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Has left me. And as reason is past care
3224,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"I am past cure, with ever more unrest"
3225,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Made frantic-mad, my thoughts as madmen's are,"
3226,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And my discourse at random from the truth,"
3227,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Not knowing what she is, who swore her fair"
3228,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And thought her bright, who is as black as hell"
3229,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,And dark as night.
3230,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,
3231,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"But list, good gentlemen,"
3232,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,This love I speak of is not as a cloak
3233,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Which one may put away to wear a coat,"
3234,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And doff that for a jacket, like the loves"
3235,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,We men are wont to have as loves or wives.
3236,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"She is the very one, the soul of souls,"
3237,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And when you put her on you put on light,"
3238,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Or wear the robe of Nessus, poisonous fire,"
3239,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Which if you tear away you tear your life,"
3240,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,And if you wear you fall to ashes. So
3241,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"'Tis not her bed-vow broke, I have broke mine,"
3242,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"That ruins me; 'tis honest faith quite lost,"
3243,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And broken hope that we could find each other,"
3244,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,And that mean more to me and less to her.
3245,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,'Tis that she could take all of me and leave me
3246,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Without a sense of loss, without a tear,"
3247,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,And make me fool and perjured for the oath
3248,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,That swore her fair and true. I feel myself
3249,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,As like a virgin who her body gives
3250,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"For love of one whose love she dreams is hers,"
3251,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"But wakes to find herself a toy of blood,"
3252,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And dupe of prodigal breath, abandoned quite"
3253,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"For other conquests. For I gave myself,"
3254,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And shrink for thought thereof, and for the loss"
3255,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Of myself never to myself restored.
3256,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,The urtication of this shame made plays
3257,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And sonnets, as you'll find behind all deeds"
3258,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"That mount to greatness, anger, hate, disgust,"
3259,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"But, better, love."
3260,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,
3261,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"To hell with punks and wenches,"
3262,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Drabs, mopsies, doxies, minxes, trulls and queans,"
3263,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Rips, harridans and strumpets, pieces, jades."
3264,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And likewise to the eternal bonfire lechers,"
3265,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"All rakehells, satyrs, goats and placket fumblers,"
3266,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Gibs, breakers-in-at-catch-doors, thunder tubes."
3267,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,I think I have a fever--hell and furies!
3268,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Or else this ale grows hotter i' the mouth.
3269,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Ben, if I die before you, let me waste"
3270,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Richly and freely in the good brown earth,"
3271,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Untrumpeted and by no bust marked out.
3272,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"What good, Ben Jonson, if the world could see"
3273,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"What face was mine, who wrote these plays and sonnets?"
3274,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Life, you have hurt me. Since Death has a veil"
3275,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"I take the veil and hide, and like great Cæsar"
3276,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Who drew his toga round him, I depart."
3277,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,
3278,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Good friends, let's to the fields--I have a fever."
3279,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"After a little walk, and by your pardon,"
3280,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"I think I'll sleep. There is no sweeter thing,"
3281,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Nor fate more blessed than to sleep. Here, world,"
3282,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,I pass you like an orange to a child:
3283,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,I can no more with you. Do what you will.
3284,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,What should my care be when I have no power
3285,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"To save, guide, mould you? Naughty world you need me"
3286,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,As little as I need you: go your way!
3287,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Tyrants shall rise and slaughter fill the earth,"
3288,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,But I shall sleep. In wars and wars and wars
3289,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,The ever-replenished youth of earth shall shriek
3290,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"And clap their gushing wounds--but I shall sleep,"
3291,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Nor earthy thunder wake me when the cannon
3292,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Shall shake the throne of Tartarus. Orators
3293,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Shall fulmine over London or America
3294,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"Of rights eternal, parchments, sacred charters"
3295,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,And cut each others' throats when reason fails--
3296,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,But I shall sleep. This globe may last and breed
3297,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"The race of men till Time cries out ""How long?"""
3298,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,But I shall sleep ten thousand thousand years.
3299,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,"I am a dream, Ben, out of a blessed sleep--"
3300,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,Let's walk and hear the lark.
3301,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,
3302,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,
3303,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,
3304,TO-MORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY,
3305,SWEET CLOVER,SWEET CLOVER
3306,SWEET CLOVER,
3307,SWEET CLOVER,
3308,SWEET CLOVER,Only a few plants up--and not a blossom
3309,SWEET CLOVER,My clover didn't catch. What is the matter?
3310,SWEET CLOVER,Old John comes by. I show him my result.
3311,SWEET CLOVER,"Look, John! My clover patch is just a failure,"
3312,SWEET CLOVER,I wanted you to sow it. Now you see
3313,SWEET CLOVER,What comes of letting Hunter do your work.
3314,SWEET CLOVER,"The ground was not plowed right, or disced perhaps,"
3315,SWEET CLOVER,"Or harrowed fine enough, or too little seed"
3316,SWEET CLOVER,Was sown.
3317,SWEET CLOVER,
3318,SWEET CLOVER,"But John, who knows a clover field,"
3319,SWEET CLOVER,Pulls up a plant and cleans the roots of soil
3320,SWEET CLOVER,And studies them.
3321,SWEET CLOVER,
3322,SWEET CLOVER,"He says, Look at the roots!"
3323,SWEET CLOVER,Hunter neglected to inoculate
3324,SWEET CLOVER,"The seed, for clover seed must always have"
3325,SWEET CLOVER,"Clover bacteria to make it grow,"
3326,SWEET CLOVER,And blossom. In a thrifty field of clover
3327,SWEET CLOVER,"The roots are studded thick with tubercles,"
3328,SWEET CLOVER,"Like little warts, made by bacteria."
3329,SWEET CLOVER,And somehow these bacteria lay hold
3330,SWEET CLOVER,"Upon the nitrogen that fills the soil,"
3331,SWEET CLOVER,"And make the plants grow, make them blossom too."
3332,SWEET CLOVER,When Hunter sowed this field he was not well:
3333,SWEET CLOVER,He should have hauled some top-soil to this field
3334,SWEET CLOVER,"From some old clover field, or made a culture"
3335,SWEET CLOVER,Of these bacteria and soaked the seed
3336,SWEET CLOVER,In it before he sowed it.
3337,SWEET CLOVER,
3338,SWEET CLOVER,"As I said,"
3339,SWEET CLOVER,Hunter was sick when he was working here.
3340,SWEET CLOVER,And then he ran away to Indiana
3341,SWEET CLOVER,And left his wife and children. Now he's back.
3342,SWEET CLOVER,His cough was just as bad in Indiana
3343,SWEET CLOVER,As it is here. A cough is pretty hard
3344,SWEET CLOVER,To run away from. Wife and children too
3345,SWEET CLOVER,"Are pretty hard to leave, since thought of them"
3346,SWEET CLOVER,Stays with a fellow and cannot be left.
3347,SWEET CLOVER,"Yes, Hunter's back, but he can't work for you."
3348,SWEET CLOVER,He's straightening out his little farm and making
3349,SWEET CLOVER,Provision for his family. Hunter's changed.
3350,SWEET CLOVER,He is a better man. It almost seems
3351,SWEET CLOVER,That Hunter's blossomed. ...
3352,SWEET CLOVER,
3353,SWEET CLOVER,I am sorry for him.
3354,SWEET CLOVER,The doctor says he has tuberculosis.
3355,SWEET CLOVER,
3356,SWEET CLOVER,
3357,SWEET CLOVER,
3358,SWEET CLOVER,
3359,SOMETHING BEYOND THE HILL,SOMETHING BEYOND THE HILL
3360,SOMETHING BEYOND THE HILL,
3361,SOMETHING BEYOND THE HILL,
3362,SOMETHING BEYOND THE HILL,To a western breeze
3363,SOMETHING BEYOND THE HILL,A row of golden tulips is nodding.
3364,SOMETHING BEYOND THE HILL,They flutter their golden wings
3365,SOMETHING BEYOND THE HILL,In a sudden ecstasy and say:
3366,SOMETHING BEYOND THE HILL,"Something comes to us from beyond,"
3367,SOMETHING BEYOND THE HILL,"Out of the sky, beyond the hill"
3368,SOMETHING BEYOND THE HILL,We give it to you.
3369,SOMETHING BEYOND THE HILL,
3370,SOMETHING BEYOND THE HILL,*       *       *       *       *
3371,SOMETHING BEYOND THE HILL,
3372,SOMETHING BEYOND THE HILL,And I walk through rows of jonquils

3740,DELILAH,
3741,DELILAH,[Sidenote: (Delilah attempteth to discover the source of Samson's
3742,DELILAH,strength. Samson very neatly deceiveth her.)]
3743,DELILAH,
3744,DELILAH,And Samson spake to thee again;
3745,DELILAH,"""With seven green withes I may be bound,"
3746,DELILAH,"So shall I be as other men."""
3747,DELILAH,Whereat the lords the green withes found--
3748,DELILAH,The same about his limbs were bound.

3750,DELILAH,Then did the fish-god in thee cry:
3751,DELILAH,"""The Philistines be upon thee now."""
3752,DELILAH,"But Samson broke the withes awry,"
3753,DELILAH,As when a keen fire toucheth tow;

3756,DELILAH,"But thou, being full of guile, didst plead:"
3757,DELILAH,"""My lord, thou hast but mocked my love"

3761,DELILAH,
3762,DELILAH,"Now, in the chamber with fresh hopes,"

3767,DELILAH,

3771,DELILAH,"Then didst thou do as he had said,"
3772,DELILAH,"Whereat the fish-god in thee cried,"
3773,DELILAH,"""The Philistines be upon thy head,"""
3774,DELILAH,"He shook his shoulders deep and wide,"
3775,DELILAH,And cast the ropes like thread aside.
3776,DELILAH,
3777,DELILAH,"Yet thou still fast to thy conceit,"
3778,DELILAH,Didst chide him softly then and say:

3782,DELILAH,
3783,DELILAH,"Then with the secret in his thought,"
3784,DELILAH,"He said: ""If thou wilt weave my hair,"

3792,DELILAH,"With laughter making all things fit,"

3794,DELILAH,
3795,DELILAH,[Sidenote: (Delilah still pursueth her designs and Samson beginning to
3796,DELILAH,be somewhat wearied hinteth very close to his secret.)]
3797,DELILAH,

3799,DELILAH,Thy delicate mouth made horrid din;

3801,DELILAH,"He woke ere thou couldst scarce begin,"

4078,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Somewhere along the Hudson, I believe."

4086,THE WORLD-SAVER,Study that skull a little! In ten years
4087,THE WORLD-SAVER,A mad admirer living here in England
4088,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Went to America and dug him up,"
4089,THE WORLD-SAVER,And brought his bones to Liverpool. Just then
4090,THE WORLD-SAVER,Our country was in turmoil over France--
4091,THE WORLD-SAVER,"(The details are so rich I lose my head,"
4092,THE WORLD-SAVER,"And can't construct my acts.)--hell's flaming here,"
4093,THE WORLD-SAVER,And we are fighting back the roaring fire
4094,THE WORLD-SAVER,That France had lighted. England would abort
4095,THE WORLD-SAVER,The era she embraced. Here is a point
4096,THE WORLD-SAVER,"That vexes me in laying out the scenes,"
4097,THE WORLD-SAVER,And persons of the play. For parliament
4098,THE WORLD-SAVER,Went into fury that these bones were here
4099,THE WORLD-SAVER,On British soil. The city raged. They took
4100,THE WORLD-SAVER,"The poor town-crier, gave him nine months' prison"
4101,THE WORLD-SAVER,For crying on the streets the bones' arrival.
4102,THE WORLD-SAVER,I'd like to put that crier in my play.
4103,THE WORLD-SAVER,"The scene of his arrest would thrill, in case"
4104,THE WORLD-SAVER,"I put it on a background understood,"
4105,THE WORLD-SAVER,"And showing why the fellow was arrested,"
4106,THE WORLD-SAVER,And what a high offence to heaven it was.
4107,THE WORLD-SAVER,Then here's another thing: The monument
4108,THE WORLD-SAVER,This zealous friend had planned was never raised.
4109,THE WORLD-SAVER,The city wouldn't have it--you can guess
4110,THE WORLD-SAVER,The brain that filled this skull and moved this hand
4111,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Had given England trouble. Yes, believe me!"
4112,THE WORLD-SAVER,He roused rebellion and he scattered pamphlets.
4113,THE WORLD-SAVER,He had the English gift of writing pamphlets.
4114,THE WORLD-SAVER,He stirred up peoples with his English gift
4115,THE WORLD-SAVER,Against the mother country. How to show this
4116,THE WORLD-SAVER,"In action, not in talk, is difficult."
4117,THE WORLD-SAVER,
4118,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Well, then here is our friend who has these bones"
4119,THE WORLD-SAVER,And cannot honor them in burial.
4120,THE WORLD-SAVER,"And so he keeps them, then becomes a bankrupt."
4121,THE WORLD-SAVER,And look! the bones pass to our friend's receiver.
4122,THE WORLD-SAVER,Are they an asset? Our Lord Chancellor
4123,THE WORLD-SAVER,Does not regard them so. I'd like to work
4124,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Some humor in my drama at this point,"
4125,THE WORLD-SAVER,And satirize his lordship just a little.
4126,THE WORLD-SAVER,Though you can scarcely call a skull an asset
4127,THE WORLD-SAVER,If it be of a man who helped to cost you
4128,THE WORLD-SAVER,The loss of half the world. So the receiver
4129,THE WORLD-SAVER,Cast out the bones and for a time a laborer
4130,THE WORLD-SAVER,Took care of them. He sold them to a man
4131,THE WORLD-SAVER,Who dealt in furniture. The empty coffin
4132,THE WORLD-SAVER,About this time turned up in Guilford--then
4133,THE WORLD-SAVER,"It's 1854, the man is dead"
4134,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Near forty years, when just the skull and hand"
4135,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Are owned by Rev. Ainslie, who evades"
4136,THE WORLD-SAVER,"All questions touching on that ownership,"
4137,THE WORLD-SAVER,"And where the ribs, spine, arms and thigh bones are--"
4138,THE WORLD-SAVER,The rest in short.
4139,THE WORLD-SAVER,
4140,THE WORLD-SAVER,And as for me--no matter
4141,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Who sold them, gave them to me, loaned them to me."
4142,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Behold the good right hand, behold the skull"
4143,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Of _Thomas Paine_, theo-philanthropist,"
4144,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Of Quaker parents, born in England! Look,"
4145,THE WORLD-SAVER,"That is the hand that wrote the Crisis, wrote"
4146,THE WORLD-SAVER,"The Age of Reason, Common Sense, and rallied"
4147,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Americans against the mother country,"
4148,THE WORLD-SAVER,With just that English gift of pamphleteering.
4149,THE WORLD-SAVER,"You see I'd have to bring George Washington,"
4150,THE WORLD-SAVER,And James Monroe and Thomas Jefferson
4151,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Upon the stage, and put into their mouths"
4152,THE WORLD-SAVER,"The eulogies they spoke on Thomas Paine,"
4153,THE WORLD-SAVER,To get before the audience that they thought
4154,THE WORLD-SAVER,He did as much as any man to win
4155,THE WORLD-SAVER,Your independence; that your Declaration
4156,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Was founded on his writings, even inspired"
4157,THE WORLD-SAVER,A clause against your negro slavery--how--
4158,THE WORLD-SAVER,Look at this hand!--he was the first to write
4159,THE WORLD-SAVER,_United States of America_--there's the hand
4160,THE WORLD-SAVER,That was the first to write those words. Good Lord
4161,THE WORLD-SAVER,This drama would out-last a Chinese drama
4162,THE WORLD-SAVER,If I put all the story in. But tell me
4163,THE WORLD-SAVER,"What to omit, and what to stress?"
4164,THE WORLD-SAVER,
4165,THE WORLD-SAVER,And still
4166,THE WORLD-SAVER,I'd have the greatest drama in the world
4167,THE WORLD-SAVER,"If I could prove he was dishonored, hunted,"
4168,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Neglected, libeled, buried like a beast,"
4169,THE WORLD-SAVER,"His bones dug up, thrown in and out of Chancery."
4170,THE WORLD-SAVER,And show these horrors overtook Tom Paine
4171,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Because he was too great, and by this showing"
4172,THE WORLD-SAVER,Instruct the world to honor its torch bearers
4173,THE WORLD-SAVER,"For time to come. No? Well, that can't be done--"
4174,THE WORLD-SAVER,I know that; but it puzzles me to think
4175,THE WORLD-SAVER,"That Hamilton--we'll say, is so revered,"
4176,THE WORLD-SAVER,"So lauded, toasted, all his papers studied"
4177,THE WORLD-SAVER,"On tariffs and on banks, evoking ahs!"
4178,THE WORLD-SAVER,Great genius! and so forth--and there's the Crisis
4179,THE WORLD-SAVER,And Common Sense which only little Shelleys
4180,THE WORLD-SAVER,Haunting the dusty book shops read at all.
4181,THE WORLD-SAVER,It wasn't that he liked his rum and drank
4182,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Too much at times, or chased a pretty skirt--"
4183,THE WORLD-SAVER,For Hamilton did that. Paine never mixed
4184,THE WORLD-SAVER,In money matters to another's wrong
4185,THE WORLD-SAVER,"For his sake or a system's. Yes, I know"
4186,THE WORLD-SAVER,The world cares more for chastity and temperance
4187,THE WORLD-SAVER,Than for a faultless life in money matters.
4188,THE WORLD-SAVER,"No use to dramatize that vital contrast,"
4189,THE WORLD-SAVER,The world to-day is what it always was.
4190,THE WORLD-SAVER,But you don't call this Hamilton an artist
4191,THE WORLD-SAVER,And Paine a mere logician and a wrangler?
4192,THE WORLD-SAVER,Your artist soul gets limed in this mad world
4193,THE WORLD-SAVER,As much as any. There is Leonardo--
4194,THE WORLD-SAVER,The point's not here.
4195,THE WORLD-SAVER,
4196,THE WORLD-SAVER,I think it's more like this:
4197,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Some men are Titans and some men are gods,"
4198,THE WORLD-SAVER,And some are gods who fall while climbing back
4199,THE WORLD-SAVER,Up to Olympus whence they came. And some
4200,THE WORLD-SAVER,While fighting for the race fall into holes
4201,THE WORLD-SAVER,Where to return and rescue them is death.
4202,THE WORLD-SAVER,Why look you here! You'd think America
4203,THE WORLD-SAVER,Had gone to war to cheat the guillotine
4204,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Of Thomas Paine, in fiery gratitude."
4205,THE WORLD-SAVER,"He's there in France's national assembly,"
4206,THE WORLD-SAVER,And votes to save King Louis with this phrase:
4207,THE WORLD-SAVER,Don't kill the man but kill the kingly office.
4208,THE WORLD-SAVER,They think him faithless to the revolution
4209,THE WORLD-SAVER,For words like these--and clap! the prison door
4210,THE WORLD-SAVER,Shuts on our Thomas. So he writes a letter
4211,THE WORLD-SAVER,To president--of what! to Washington
4212,THE WORLD-SAVER,"President of the United States of America,"
4213,THE WORLD-SAVER,A title which Paine coined in seventy-seven
4214,THE WORLD-SAVER,Now lettered on a monstrous seal of state!
4215,THE WORLD-SAVER,"And Washington is silent, never answers,"
4216,THE WORLD-SAVER,"And leaves our Thomas shivering in a cell,"
4217,THE WORLD-SAVER,Who hears the guillotine go slash and click!
4218,THE WORLD-SAVER,Perhaps this is the nucleus of my drama.
4219,THE WORLD-SAVER,Or else to show that Washington was wise
4220,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Respecting England's hatred of our Thomas,"
4221,THE WORLD-SAVER,"And wise to lift no finger to save Thomas,"
4222,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Incurring England's wrath, who hated Thomas"
4223,THE WORLD-SAVER,"For pamphlets like the ""Crisis"" ""Common Sense."""
4224,THE WORLD-SAVER,That may be just the story for my drama.
4225,THE WORLD-SAVER,Old Homer satirized the human race
4226,THE WORLD-SAVER,For warring for the rescue of a Cyprian.
4227,THE WORLD-SAVER,But there's not stuff for satire in a war
4228,THE WORLD-SAVER,Ensuing on the insult for the rescue
4229,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Of nothing but a fellow who wrote pamphlets,"
4230,THE WORLD-SAVER,And won a continent for the rescuer.
4231,THE WORLD-SAVER,"That's tragedy, the more so if the fellow"
4232,THE WORLD-SAVER,Likes rum and writes that Jesus was a man.
4233,THE WORLD-SAVER,This crushing of poor Thomas in the hate
4234,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Of England and her power, America's"
4235,THE WORLD-SAVER,Great fear and lowered strength might make a drama
4236,THE WORLD-SAVER,As showing how the more you do in life
4237,THE WORLD-SAVER,"The greater shall you suffer. This is true,"
4238,THE WORLD-SAVER,If what you battered down gets hold of you.
4239,THE WORLD-SAVER,This drama almost drives me mad at times.
4240,THE WORLD-SAVER,I have his story at my fingers' ends.
4241,THE WORLD-SAVER,But it won't take a shape. It flies my hands.
4242,THE WORLD-SAVER,I think I'll have to give it up. What's that?
4243,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Well, if an audience of to-day would turn"
4244,THE WORLD-SAVER,From seeing Thomas Paine upon the stage
4245,THE WORLD-SAVER,"What is the use to write it, if they'd turn"
4246,THE WORLD-SAVER,No matter how you wrote it? I believe
4247,THE WORLD-SAVER,"They wouldn't like it in America,"
4248,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Nor England either, maybe--you are right!"
4249,THE WORLD-SAVER,A drama with no audience is a failure.
4250,THE WORLD-SAVER,But here's this skull. What shall I do with it?
4251,THE WORLD-SAVER,If I should have it cased in solid silver
4252,THE WORLD-SAVER,There is no shrine to take it--no Cologne
4253,THE WORLD-SAVER,For skulls like this.
4254,THE WORLD-SAVER,
4255,THE WORLD-SAVER,"Well, I must die sometime,"
4256,THE WORLD-SAVER,And who will get it then? Look at this skull!
4257,THE WORLD-SAVER,"This bony hand! Then look at me, my friend:"
4258,THE WORLD-SAVER,A man who has a theme the world despises!

4357,IN THE GARDEN AT THE DAWN HOUR,And softly steal out to the garden
4358,IN THE GARDEN AT THE DAWN HOUR,Under the Favrile goblet of the dawning.
4359,IN THE GARDEN AT THE DAWN HOUR,"And a wind moves out of the south-land,"
4360,IN THE GARDEN AT THE DAWN HOUR,"Like a film of silver,"
4361,IN THE GARDEN AT THE DAWN HOUR,And thrills with a far borne message
4362,IN THE GARDEN AT THE DAWN HOUR,The flowers of the garden.
4363,IN THE GARDEN AT THE DAWN HOUR,Poppies untie their scarlet hoods and wave them
4364,IN THE GARDEN AT THE DAWN HOUR,To the south wind as he passes.

4372,IN THE GARDEN AT THE DAWN HOUR,As the star of morning fades.
4373,IN THE GARDEN AT THE DAWN HOUR,Flying from scythes of air
4374,IN THE GARDEN AT THE DAWN HOUR,"The hare-bells, purples and golden glow"
4375,IN THE GARDEN AT THE DAWN HOUR,On the sand-hill back of the orchard
4376,IN THE GARDEN AT THE DAWN HOUR,Race before the feet of the wind.
4377,IN THE GARDEN AT THE DAWN HOUR,But clusters of oak-leaves over the yellow sand rim

4485,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Where stillness shows the star that fits the star
4486,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Of truth in spirits treasured, imaged, kept"
4487,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Through sorrow, blood and death,--God moves in that"
4488,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,And there I find Him.
4489,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,
4490,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,But these tears--for whom
4491,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Or what are tears? The Old Guard--oh, my friend"
4492,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"That melancholy remnant! And the horse,"
4493,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"White, to be sure, but not Marengo, wearing"
4494,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,The saddle and the bridle which he used.
4495,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"My tears take quality for these pitiful things,"
4496,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,But other quality for the purple robe
4497,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Over the coffin lettered in pure gold
4498,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"""Napoleon""--ah, the emperor at last"
4499,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Come back to Paris! And his spirit looks
4500,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Over the land he loved, with what result?"
4501,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Does just the army that acclaimed him rise
4502,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Which rose to hail him back from Elba?--no
4503,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"All France acclaims him! Princes of the church,"
4504,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,And notables uncover! At the door
4505,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"A herald cries ""The Emperor!"" Those assembled"
4506,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Rise and do reverence to him. Look at Soult,"
4507,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"He hands the king the sword of Austerlitz,"
4508,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"The king turns to me, hands the sword to me,"
4509,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"I place it on the coffin--dear Gourgaud,"
4510,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Embrace me, clasp my hand! I weep and laugh"
4511,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,For thinking that the Emperor is home;
4512,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,For thinking I have laid upon his bed
4513,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"The sword that makes inviolable his bed,"
4514,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Since History stepped to where I stood and stands
4515,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"To say forever: Here he rests, be still,"
4516,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Bow down, pass by in reverence--the Ages"
4517,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Like giant caryatides that look
4518,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,With sleepless eyes upon the world and hold
4519,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"With never tiring hands the Vault of Time,"
4520,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Command your reverence.
4521,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,
4522,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,What have we seen?
4523,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Why this, that every man, himself achieving"
4524,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Exhausts the life that drives him to the work
4525,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Of self-expression, of the vision in him,"
4526,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"His reason for existence, as he sees it."
4527,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,He may or may not mould the epic stuff
4528,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"As he would wish, as lookers on have hope"
4529,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"His hands shall mould it, and by failing take--"
4530,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"For slip of hand, tough clay or blinking eye,"
4531,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,A cinder for that moment in the eye--
4532,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,A world of blame; for hooting or dispraise
4533,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Have all his work misvalued for the time,"
4534,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,And pump his heart up harder to subdue
4535,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Envy, or fear or greed, in any case"
4536,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"He grows and leaves and blossoms, so consumes"
4537,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,His soul's endowment in the vision of life.
4538,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"And thus of him. Why, there at Fontainebleau"
4539,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"He is a man full spent, he idles, sleeps,"
4540,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Hears with dull ears: Down with the Corsican,"
4541,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Up with the Bourbon lilies! Royalists,"
4542,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Conspirators, and clericals may shout"
4543,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Their hatred of him, but he sits for hours"
4544,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Kicking the gravel with his little heel,"
4545,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Which lately trampled sceptres in the mud.
4546,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Well, what was he at Waterloo?--you know:"
4547,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,That piercing spirit which at mid-day power
4548,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Knew all the maps of Europe--could unfold
4549,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"A map and say here is the place, the way,"
4550,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"The road, the valley, hill, destroy them here."
4551,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Why, all his memory of maps was blurred"
4552,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,The night before he failed at Waterloo.
4553,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"The Emperor was sick, my friend, we know it."
4554,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,He could not ride a horse at Waterloo.
4555,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"His soul was spent, that's all. But who was rested?"
4556,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"The dirty Bourbons skulking back to Paris,"
4557,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Now that our giant democrat was sick.
4558,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Oh, yes, the dirty Bourbons skulked to Paris"
4559,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Helped by the Duke and Blücher, damn their souls."
4560,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,
4561,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,What is a man to do whose work is done
4562,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"And does not feel so well, has cancer, say?"
4563,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,You know he could have reached America
4564,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,After his fall at Waterloo. Good God!
4565,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,If only he had done it! For they say
4566,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,New Orleans is a city good to live in.
4567,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,And he had ceded to America
4568,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Louisiana, which in time would curb"
4569,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,The English lion. But he didn't go there.
4570,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,His mind was weakened else he had foreseen
4571,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"The lion he had tangled, wounded, scourged"
4572,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Would claw him if it got him, play with him"
4573,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Before it killed him. Who was England then?--
4574,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,
4575,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"An old, mad, blind, despised and dying king"
4576,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Who lost a continent for the lust that slew
4577,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,The Emperor--the world will say at last
4578,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,It was no other. Who was England then?
4579,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"A regent bad as husband, father, son,"
4580,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Monarch and friend. But who was England then?
4581,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Great Castlereagh who cut his throat, but who"
4582,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Had cut his country's long before. The duke--
4583,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Since Waterloo, and since the Emperor slept--"
4584,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"The English stoned the duke, he bars his windows"
4585,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"With iron 'gainst the mobs who break to fury,"
4586,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,To see the Duke waylay democracy.
4587,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,The world's great conqueror's conqueror!--Eh bien!
4588,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Grips England after Waterloo, but when"
4589,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,The people see the duke for what he is:
4590,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"A blocker of reform, a Tory sentry,"
4591,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"A spotless knight of ancient privilege,"
4592,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"They up and stone him, by the very deed"
4593,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Stone him for wronging the democracy
4594,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,The Emperor erected with the sword.
4595,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"The world's great conqueror's conqueror--Oh, I sicken!"
4596,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Odes are like head-stones, standing while the graves"
4597,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Are guarded and kept up, but falling down"
4598,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,To ruin and erasure when the graves
4599,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Are left to sink. Hey! there you English poets,"
4600,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Picking from daily libels, slanders, junk"
4601,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Of metal for your tablets 'gainst the Emperor,"
4602,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Melt up true metal at your peril, poets,"
4603,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Sweet moralists, monopolists of God."
4604,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"But who was England? Byron driven out,"
4605,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"And courts of chancery vile but sacrosanct,"
4606,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Despoiling Shelley of his children; Southey,"
4607,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"The turn-coat panegyrist of King George,"
4608,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"An old, mad, blind, despised, dead king at last;"
4609,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,A realm of rotten boroughs massed to stop
4610,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,The progress of democracy and chanting
4611,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"To God Almighty hymns for Waterloo,"
4612,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Which did not stop democracy, as they hoped."
4613,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,For England of to-day is freer--why?
4614,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,The revolution and the Emperor!
4615,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"They quench the revolution, send Napoleon"
4616,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,To St. Helena--but the ashes soar
4617,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Grown finer, grown invisible at last."
4618,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"And all the time a wind is blowing ashes,"
4619,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,And sifting them upon the spotless linen
4620,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Of kings and dukes in England till at last
4621,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,They find themselves mistaken for the people.
4622,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Drink to me, clasp my hand, embrace me--_tiens_!"
4623,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"The Emperor is home again in France,"
4624,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,And Europe for democracy is thrilling.
4625,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Now don't you see the Emperor was sick,"
4626,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,The shadows falling slant across his mind
4627,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"To write to such an England: ""My career"
4628,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Is ended and I come to sit me down
4629,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Before the fireside of the British people,"
4630,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"And claim protection from your Royal Highness""--"
4631,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"This to the regent--""as a generous foe"
4632,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Most constant and most powerful""--I weep."
4633,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"They tricked him Gourgaud. Once upon the ship,"
4634,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"He thinks he's bound for England, and why not?"
4635,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"They dine him, treat him like an Emperor."
4636,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"And then they tack and sail to St. Helena,"
4637,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Give him a cow shed for a residence.
4638,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Depute that thing Sir Hudson Lowe to watch him,"
4639,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Spy on his torture, intercept his letters,"
4640,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Step on his broken wings, and mock the film"
4641,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Descending on those eyes of failing fire. ...
4642,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,
4643,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,One day the packet brought to him a book
4644,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Inscribed by Hobhouse, ""To the Emperor."""
4645,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Lowe kept the book but when the Emperor learned
4646,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Lowe kept the book, because 'twas so inscribed,"
4647,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"The Emperor said--I stood near by--""Who gave you"
4648,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,The right to slur my title? In a few years
4649,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Yourself, Lord Castlereagh, the duke himself"
4650,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Will be beneath oblivion's dust, remembered"
4651,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"For your indignities to me, that's all."
4652,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,England expended millions on her libels
4653,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,To poison Europe's mind and make my purpose
4654,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Obscure or bloody--how have they availed?
4655,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"You have me here upon this scarp of rock,"
4656,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"But truth will pierce the clouds, 'tis like the sun"
4657,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,And like the sun it cannot be destroyed.
4658,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Your Wellingtons and Metternichs may dam
4659,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"The liberal stream, but only to make stronger"
4660,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"The torrent when it breaks. ""Is it not true?"
4661,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"That's why I weep and laugh to-day, my friend"
4662,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,And trust God as I have not trusted yet.
4663,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"And then the Emperor said: ""What have I claimed?"
4664,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,A portion of the royal blood of Europe?
4665,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"A crown for blood's sake? No, my royal blood"
4666,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Is dated from the field of Montenotte,"
4667,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"And from my mother there in Corsica,"
4668,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,And from the revolution. I'm a man
4669,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Who made himself because the people made me.
4670,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,You understand as little as she did
4671,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"When I had brought her back from Austria,"
4672,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,And riding through the streets of Paris pointed
4673,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Up to the window of the little room
4674,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Where I had lodged when I came from Brienne,"
4675,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,A poor boy with my way to make--as poor
4676,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"As Andrew Jackson in America,"
4677,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,No more a despot than he is a despot.
4678,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Your England understands. I was a menace
4679,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Not as a despot, but as head and front,"
4680,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Eyes, brain and leader of democracy,"
4681,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Which like the messenger of God was marking
4682,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,The doors of kings for slaughter. England lies.
4683,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Your England understands I had to hold
4684,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"By rule compact a people drunk with rapture,"
4685,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"And torn by counter forces, had to fight"
4686,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,The royalists of Europe who beheld
4687,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Their peoples feverish from the great infection,"
4688,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Who hoped to stamp the plague in France and stop
4689,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Its spread to them. Your England understands.
4690,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Save Castlereagh and Wellington and Southey.
4691,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"But look you, sir, my roads, canals and harbors,"
4692,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"My schools, finance, my code, the manufactures"
4693,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Arts, sciences I builded, democratic"
4694,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Triumphs which I won will live for ages--
4695,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"These are my witnesses, will testify"
4696,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Forever what I was and meant to do.
4697,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,The ideas which I brought to power will stifle
4698,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"All royalty, all feudalism--look"
4699,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"They live in England, they illuminate"
4700,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"America, they will be faith, religion"
4701,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"For every people--these I kindled, carried"
4702,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Their flaming torch through Europe as the chief
4703,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Torch bearer, soldier, representative."""
4704,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,
4705,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"You were not there, Gourgaud--but wait a minute,"
4706,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,I choke with tears and laughter. Listen now:
4707,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Sir Hudson Lowe looked at the Emperor
4708,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Contemptuous but not the less bewitched.
4709,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"And when the Emperor finished, out he drawled"
4710,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"""You make me smile."" Why that is memorable:"
4711,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,It should be carved upon Sir Hudson's stone.
4712,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"He was a prophet, founder of the sect"
4713,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Of smilers and of laughers through the world,"
4714,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Smilers and laughers that the Emperor
4715,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Told every whit the truth. Look you at Europe,"
4716,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"What were it in this day except for France,"
4717,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Napoleon's France, the revolution's France?"
4718,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,What will it be as time goes on but peoples
4719,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Made free through France?
4720,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,
4721,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"I take the good and ill,"
4722,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Think over how he lounged, lay late in bed,"
4723,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Spent long hours in the bath, counted the hours,"
4724,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Pale, broken, wracked with pain, insulted, watched,"
4725,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"His child torn from him, Josephine and wife"
4726,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Silent or separate, waiting long for death,"
4727,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Looking with filmed eyes upon his wings
4728,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Broken, upon the rocks stretched out to gain"
4729,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"A little sun, and crying to the sea"
4730,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,With broken voice--I weep when I remember
4731,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,Such things which you and I from day to day
4732,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Beheld, nor could not mitigate. But then"
4733,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"There is that night of thunder, and the dawning"
4734,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,And all that day of storm and toward the evening
4735,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"He says: ""Deploy the eagles!"" ""Onward!"" Well,"
4736,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,I leave the room and say to Steward there:
4737,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"""The Emperor is dead."" That very moment"
4738,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,A crash of thunder deafened us. You see
4739,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,A great age boomed in thunder its renewal--
4740,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,"Drink to me, clasp my hand, embrace me, friend."
4741,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,
4742,BERTRAND AND GOURGAUD TALK OVER OLD TIMES,

4808,DEAR OLD DICK,(Dedicated to Vachel Lindsay and in Memory of Richard E. Burke)
4809,DEAR OLD DICK,
4810,DEAR OLD DICK,
4811,DEAR OLD DICK,Said dear old Dick
4812,DEAR OLD DICK,To the colored waiter:
4813,DEAR OLD DICK,"""Here, George! be quick"
4814,DEAR OLD DICK,Roast beef and a potato.
4815,DEAR OLD DICK,"I'm due at the courthouse at half-past one,"
4816,DEAR OLD DICK,"You black old scoundrel, get a move on you!"
4817,DEAR OLD DICK,I want a pot of coffee and a graham bun.
4818,DEAR OLD DICK,"This vinegar decanter'll make a groove on you,"
4819,DEAR OLD DICK,"You black-faced mandril, you grinning baboon--"""
4820,DEAR OLD DICK,"""Yas sah! Yas sah,""answered the coon."
4821,DEAR OLD DICK,"""Now don't you talk back,"" said dear old Dick,"
4822,DEAR OLD DICK,"""Go and get my dinner or I'll show you a trick"
4823,DEAR OLD DICK,"With a plate, a tumbler or a silver castor,"
4824,DEAR OLD DICK,"Fuliginous monkey, sired by old Nick."""
4825,DEAR OLD DICK,"And the nigger all the time was moving round the table,"
4826,DEAR OLD DICK,Rattling the silver things faster and faster--
4827,DEAR OLD DICK,"""Yes sah! Yas sah, soon as I'se able"
4828,DEAR OLD DICK,"I'll bring yo' dinnah as shore as yo's bawn."""
4829,DEAR OLD DICK,"""Quit talking about it; hurry and be gone,"
4830,DEAR OLD DICK,"You low-down nigger,"" said dear old Dick."
4831,DEAR OLD DICK,
4832,DEAR OLD DICK,"Then I said to my friend: ""Suppose he'd up and stick"
4833,DEAR OLD DICK,A knife in your side for raggin' him so hard;
4834,DEAR OLD DICK,Or how would you relish some spit in your broth?
4835,DEAR OLD DICK,Or a little Paris green in your cheese for chard?
4836,DEAR OLD DICK,Or something in your coffee to make your stomach froth?
4837,DEAR OLD DICK,Or a bit of asafoetida hidden in your pie?
4838,DEAR OLD DICK,That's a gentlemanly nigger or he'd black your eye/'
4839,DEAR OLD DICK,
4840,DEAR OLD DICK,Then dear old Dick made this long reply:
4841,DEAR OLD DICK,"""You know, I love a nigger,"
4842,DEAR OLD DICK,And I love this nigger.
4843,DEAR OLD DICK,I met him first on the train from California
4844,DEAR OLD DICK,Out of Kansas City; in the morning early
4845,DEAR OLD DICK,"I walked through the diner, feeling upset"
4846,DEAR OLD DICK,"For a cup of coffee, looking rather surly."
4847,DEAR OLD DICK,"And there sat this nigger by a table all dressed,"
4848,DEAR OLD DICK,"Waiting for the time to serve the omelet,"
4849,DEAR OLD DICK,Buttered toast and coffee to the passengers.
4850,DEAR OLD DICK,And this is what he said in a fine southern way:
4851,DEAR OLD DICK,"'Good mawnin,' sah, I hopes yo' had yo' rest,"
4852,DEAR OLD DICK,I'm glad to see you on dis sunny day.'
4853,DEAR OLD DICK,Now think! here's a human who has no other cares
4854,DEAR OLD DICK,"Except to please the white man, serve him when he's starving,"
4855,DEAR OLD DICK,And who has as much fun when he sees you carving
4856,DEAR OLD DICK,"The sirloin as you do, does this black man."
4857,DEAR OLD DICK,"Just think for a minute, how the negroes excel,"
4858,DEAR OLD DICK,Can you beat them with a banjo or a broiling pan?
4859,DEAR OLD DICK,There's music in their soul as original
4860,DEAR OLD DICK,As any breed of people in the whole wide earth;
4861,DEAR OLD DICK,"They're elemental hope, heartiness, mirth."
4862,DEAR OLD DICK,There are only two things real American:
4863,DEAR OLD DICK,"One is Christian Science, the other is the nigger."
4864,DEAR OLD DICK,Think it over for yourself and see if you can figure
4865,DEAR OLD DICK,Anything beside that is not imitation
4866,DEAR OLD DICK,Of something in Europe in this hybrid nation.
4867,DEAR OLD DICK,Return to this globe five hundred years hence--
4868,DEAR OLD DICK,You'll see how the fundamental color of the coon
4869,DEAR OLD DICK,"In art, in music, has altered our tune;"
4870,DEAR OLD DICK,We are destined to bow to their influence;
4871,DEAR OLD DICK,"There's a whole cult of music in Dixie alone,"
4872,DEAR OLD DICK,"And that is America put into tone."""
4873,DEAR OLD DICK,
4874,DEAR OLD DICK,And dear old Dick gathered speed and said:
4875,DEAR OLD DICK,"""Sometimes through Dvorák a vision arises"
4876,DEAR OLD DICK,To the words of Merneptah whose hands were red:
4877,DEAR OLD DICK,"'I shall live, I shall live, I shall grow, I shall grow,"
4878,DEAR OLD DICK,"I shall wake up in peace, I shall thrill with the glow"
4879,DEAR OLD DICK,"Of the life of Temu, the god who prizes"
4880,DEAR OLD DICK,Favorite souls and the souls of kings.'
4881,DEAR OLD DICK,"Now these are the words, and here is the dream,"
4882,DEAR OLD DICK,No wonder you think I am seeing things:
4883,DEAR OLD DICK,The desert of Egypt shimmers in the gleam
4884,DEAR OLD DICK,Of the noonday sun on my dazzled sight.
4885,DEAR OLD DICK,And a giant negro as black as night
4886,DEAR OLD DICK,Is walking by a camel in a caravan.
4887,DEAR OLD DICK,His great back glistens with the streaming sweat.
4888,DEAR OLD DICK,"The camel is ridden by a light-faced man,"
4889,DEAR OLD DICK,"A Greek perhaps, or Arabian."
4890,DEAR OLD DICK,And this giant negro is rhythmically swaying
4891,DEAR OLD DICK,With the rhythm of the camel's neck up and down.
4892,DEAR OLD DICK,"He seems to be singing, rollicking, playing;"
4893,DEAR OLD DICK,"His ivory teeth are glistening, the Greek is listening"
4894,DEAR OLD DICK,To the negro keeping time like a tabouret.
4895,DEAR OLD DICK,"And what cares he for Memphis town,"
4896,DEAR OLD DICK,"Merneptah the bloody, or Books of the Dead,"
4897,DEAR OLD DICK,"Pyramids, philosophies of madness or dread?"
4898,DEAR OLD DICK,"A tune is in his heart, a reality:"
4899,DEAR OLD DICK,"The camel, the desert are things that be,"
4900,DEAR OLD DICK,"He's a negro slave, but his heart is free."""
4901,DEAR OLD DICK,
4902,DEAR OLD DICK,Just then the colored waiter brought in the dinner.
4903,DEAR OLD DICK,"""Get a hustle on you, you miserable sinner,"""
4904,DEAR OLD DICK,Said dear old Dick to the colored waiter.
4905,DEAR OLD DICK,"""Heah's a nice piece of beef and a great big potato."
4906,DEAR OLD DICK,"I hopes yo'll enjoy 'em sah, yas I do;"
4907,DEAR OLD DICK,"Heah's black mustahd greens, 'specially for yo',"
4908,DEAR OLD DICK,And a fine piece of jowl that I swiped and took
4909,DEAR OLD DICK,"From a dish set by, by the git-away cook."
4910,DEAR OLD DICK,"I hope yo'll enjoy 'em, sah, yas I do."""
4911,DEAR OLD DICK,"""Well, George,"" Dick said, ""if Gabriel blew"
4912,DEAR OLD DICK,"His horn this minute, you'd up and ascend"
4913,DEAR OLD DICK,"To wait on St. Peter world without end."""
4914,DEAR OLD DICK,
4915,DEAR OLD DICK,
4916,DEAR OLD DICK,
4917,DEAR OLD DICK,
4918,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS
4919,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,
4920,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,
4921,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,I saw a room where many feet were dancing.
4922,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,The ceiling and the wall were mirrors glancing
4923,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,"Both flames of candles and the heaven's light,"
4924,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,Though windows there were none for air or flight.
4925,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,The room was in a form polygonal
4926,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,Reached by a little door and narrow hall.
4927,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,"One could behold them enter for the dance,"
4928,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,"And waken as it were out of a trance,"
4929,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,And either singly or with some one whirl:
4930,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,"The old, the young, full livers, boy and girl."
4931,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,And every panel of the room was just
4932,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,A mirrored door through which a hand was thrust
4933,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,"Here, there, around the room, a soul to seize"
4934,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,"Whereat a scream would rise, but no surcease"
4935,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,"Of music or of dancing, save by him"
4936,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,Drawn through the mirrored panel to the dim
4937,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,"And unknown space behind the flashing mirrors,"
4938,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,And by his partner struck through by the terrors
4939,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,Of sudden loss.
4940,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,
4941,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,And looking I could see
4942,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,That scarcely any dancer here could free
4943,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,"His eyes from off the mirrors, but would gaze"
4944,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,"Upon himself or others, till a craze"
4945,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,Shone in his eyes thus to anticipate
4946,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,The hand that took each dancer soon or late.
4947,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,"Some analyzed themselves, some only glanced,"
4948,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,Some stared and paled and then more madly danced.
4949,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,One dancer only never looked at all.
4950,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,He seemed soul captured by the carnival.
4951,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,"There were so many dancers there he loved,"
4952,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,"He was so greatly by the music moved,"
4953,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,He had no time to study his own face
4954,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,There in the mirrors as from place to place
4955,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,He quickly danced.
4956,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,
4957,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,Until I saw at last
4958,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,This dancer by the whirling dancers cast
4959,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,Face full against a mirrored panel where
4960,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,Before he could look at himself or stare
4961,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,"He plunged through to the other side--and quick,"
4962,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,"As water closes when you lift the stick,"
4963,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,The mirrored panel swung in place and left
4964,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,"No trace of him, as 'twere a magic trick."
4965,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,But all his partners thus so soon bereft
4966,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,Went dancing to the music as before.
4967,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,But I saw faces in that mirrored door
4968,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,Anatomizing their forced smiles and watching
4969,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,"Their faces over shoulders, even matching"
4970,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,Their terror with each other's to repress
4971,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,A growing fear in seeing it was less
4972,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,"Than some one else's, or to ease despair"
4973,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,"By looking in a face who did not care,"
4974,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,While watching for the hand that through some door
4975,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,Caught a poor dancer from the dancing floor
4976,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,With every time-beat of the orchestra.
4977,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,What is this room of mirrors? Who can say?
4978,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,
4979,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,
4980,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,
4981,THE ROOM OF MIRRORS,
4982,THE LETTER,THE LETTER
4983,THE LETTER,
4984,THE LETTER,
4985,THE LETTER,What does one gain by living? What by dying
4986,THE LETTER,Is lost worth having? What the daily things
4987,THE LETTER,Lived through together make them worth the while
4988,THE LETTER,For their sakes or for life's? Where's the denying
4989,THE LETTER,Of souls through separation? There's your smile!
4990,THE LETTER,And your hands' touch! And the long day that brings
4991,THE LETTER,Half uttered nothings of delight! But then
4992,THE LETTER,"Now that I see you not, and shall again"
4993,THE LETTER,Touch you no more--memory can possess
4994,THE LETTER,"Your soul's essential self, and none the less"
4995,THE LETTER,You live with me. I therefore write to you
4996,THE LETTER,This letter just as if you were away
4997,THE LETTER,"Upon a journey, or a holiday;"
4998,THE LETTER,And so I'll put down everything that's new
4999,THE LETTER,"In this secluded village, since you left. ..."
5000,THE LETTER,"Now let me think! Well, then, as I remember,"
5001,THE LETTER,After ten days the lilacs burst in bloom.
5002,THE LETTER,We had spring all at once--the long December
5003,THE LETTER,"Gave way to sunshine. Then we swept your room,"
5004,THE LETTER,And laid your things away. And then one morning
5005,THE LETTER,I saw the mother robin giving warning
5006,THE LETTER,To little bills stuck just above the rim
5007,THE LETTER,"Of that nest which you watched while being built,"
5008,THE LETTER,"Near where she sat, upon a leafless limb,"
5009,THE LETTER,With folded wings against an April rain.
5010,THE LETTER,"On June the tenth Edward and Julia married,"
5011,THE LETTER,I did not go for fear of an old pain.
5012,THE LETTER,"I was out on the porch as they drove by,"
5013,THE LETTER,Coming from church. I think I never scanned
5014,THE LETTER,A girl's face with such sunny smiles upon it
5015,THE LETTER,Showing beneath the roses on her bonnet--
5016,THE LETTER,I went into the house to have a cry.
5017,THE LETTER,A few days later Kimbrough lost his wife.
5018,THE LETTER,Between housework and hoeing in the garden
5019,THE LETTER,I read Sir Thomas More and Goethe's life.
5020,THE LETTER,My heart was numb and still I had to harden
5021,THE LETTER,All memory or die. And just the same
5022,THE LETTER,"As when you sat beside the window, passed"
5023,THE LETTER,"Larson, the cobbler, hollow-chested, lamed."
5024,THE LETTER,He did not die till late November came.
5025,THE LETTER,"Things did not come as Doctor Jones forecast,"
5026,THE LETTER,'Twas June when Mary Morgan had her child.
5027,THE LETTER,Her husband was in Monmouth at the time.
5028,THE LETTER,"She had no milk, the baby is not well."
5029,THE LETTER,The Baptist Church has got a fine new bell.
5030,THE LETTER,And after harvest Joseph Clifford tiled
5031,THE LETTER,His bottom land. Then Judy Heaton's crime
5032,THE LETTER,"Has shocked the village, for the monster killed"
5033,THE LETTER,Glendora Wilson's father at his door--
5034,THE LETTER,A daughter's name was why the blood was spilled.
5035,THE LETTER,"I could go on, but wherefore tell you more?"
5036,THE LETTER,The world of men has gone its olden way
5037,THE LETTER,With war in Europe and the same routine
5038,THE LETTER,Of life among us that you knew when here.
5039,THE LETTER,"This gossip is not idle, since I say"
5040,THE LETTER,"By means of it what I would tell you, dear:"
5041,THE LETTER,"I have been near you, dear, for I have been"
5042,THE LETTER,"Not with you through these things, but in despite"
5043,THE LETTER,"Of living them without you, therefore near"
5044,THE LETTER,In spirit and in memory with you.
5045,THE LETTER,
5046,THE LETTER,*       *       *       *       *
5047,THE LETTER,
5048,THE LETTER,Do you remember that delightful Inn
5049,THE LETTER,"At Chester and the Roman wall, and how"
5050,THE LETTER,We walked from Avon clear to Kenilworth?
5051,THE LETTER,And afterward when you and I came down
5052,THE LETTER,"To London, I forsook the murky town,"
5053,THE LETTER,"And left you to quaint ways and crowded places,"
5054,THE LETTER,While I went on to Putney just to see
5055,THE LETTER,Old Swinburne and to look into his face's
5056,THE LETTER,Changeable lights and shadows and to seize on
5057,THE LETTER,A finer thing than any verse he wrote?
5058,THE LETTER,(Oh beautiful illusions of our youth!)
5059,THE LETTER,He did not see me gladly. Talked of treason
5060,THE LETTER,To England's greatness. What was Camden like?
5061,THE LETTER,Did old Walt Whitman smoke or did he drink?
5062,THE LETTER,"And Longfellow was sweet, but couldn't think."
5063,THE LETTER,His mood was crusty. Lowell made him laugh!
5064,THE LETTER,Meantime Watts-Dunton came and broke in half
5065,THE LETTER,"My visit, so I left."
5066,THE LETTER,
5067,THE LETTER,The thing was this:
5068,THE LETTER,None of this talk was Swinburne any more
5069,THE LETTER,"Than some child of his loins would take his hair,"
5070,THE LETTER,"Eyes, skin, from him in some pangenesis,--"
5071,THE LETTER,"His flesh was nothing but a poor affair,"
5072,THE LETTER,A channel for the eternal stream--his flesh
5073,THE LETTER,"Gave nothing closer, mind you, than his book,"
5074,THE LETTER,But rather blurred it; even his eyes' look
5075,THE LETTER,"Confused ""Madonna Mia"" from its fresh"
5076,THE LETTER,And liquid meaning. So I knew at last
5077,THE LETTER,His real immortal self is in his verse.
5078,THE LETTER,
5079,THE LETTER,*       *       *       *       *
5080,THE LETTER,
5081,THE LETTER,Since you have gone I've thought of this so much.
5082,THE LETTER,I cannot lose you in this universe--
5083,THE LETTER,I first must lose myself. The essential touch
5084,THE LETTER,Of soul possession lies not in the walk
5085,THE LETTER,"Of daily life on earth, nor in the talk"
5086,THE LETTER,"Of daily things, nor in the sight of eyes"
5087,THE LETTER,"Looking in other eyes, nor daily bread"
5088,THE LETTER,"Broken together, nor the hour of love"
5089,THE LETTER,When flesh surrenders depths of things divine
5090,THE LETTER,"Beyond all vision, as they were the dream"
5091,THE LETTER,"Of other planets, but without these even"
5092,THE LETTER,"In death and separation, there is heaven:"
5093,THE LETTER,By just that unison and its memory
5094,THE LETTER,Which brought our lips together. To be free
5095,THE LETTER,"From accidents of being, to be freeing"
5096,THE LETTER,"The soul from trammels on essential being,"
5097,THE LETTER,Is to possess the loved one. I have strayed
5098,THE LETTER,Into the only heaven God has made:
5099,THE LETTER,"That's where we know each other as we are,"
5100,THE LETTER,"In the bright ether of some quiet star,"
5101,THE LETTER,Communing as two memories with each other.

5132,SONG OF MEN,Of woman's flesh:
5133,SONG OF MEN,"Worker, soldier, magistrate"
5134,SONG OF MEN,Of city or realm;
5135,SONG OF MEN,"Artist, builder, wrestling Fate"
5136,SONG OF MEN,Lest it overwhelm
5137,SONG OF MEN,"The brood or the race, or the cherished state."
5138,SONG OF MEN,They sing at the helm
5139,SONG OF MEN,"When the waters roar and the waves are great,"
5140,SONG OF MEN,And the gale is fresh.
5141,SONG OF MEN,
5142,SONG OF MEN,"There are two miracles, women and men--"
5143,SONG OF MEN,"Yea, four there be:"
5144,SONG OF MEN,"A woman's flesh, and the strength of a man,"
5145,SONG OF MEN,And God's decree.
5146,SONG OF MEN,And a babe from the womb in a little span
5147,SONG OF MEN,Ere the month be ten.
5148,SONG OF MEN,Their rapturous arms entwine and cling
5149,SONG OF MEN,In the depths of night;
5150,SONG OF MEN,"He hunts for her face for his wondering,"
5151,SONG OF MEN,And her eyes are bright.
5152,SONG OF MEN,"A woman's flesh is soil, but the spring"
5153,SONG OF MEN,Is man's delight.
5154,SONG OF MEN,
5155,SONG OF MEN,
5156,SONG OF WOMEN,SONG OF WOMEN
5157,SONG OF WOMEN,
5158,SONG OF WOMEN,How beautiful is the flesh of women--
5159,SONG OF WOMEN,"Their throats, their breasts!"
5160,SONG OF WOMEN,"My wonder is a flame which burns,"
5161,SONG OF WOMEN,A flame which rests;
5162,SONG OF WOMEN,"It is a flame which no wind turns,"
5163,SONG OF WOMEN,And a flame which quests.
5164,SONG OF WOMEN,
5165,SONG OF WOMEN,"I know a woman who has red lips,"
5166,SONG OF WOMEN,Like coals which are fanned.
5167,SONG OF WOMEN,"Her throat is tied narcissus, it dips"
5168,SONG OF WOMEN,From her white-rose chin.
5169,SONG OF WOMEN,Her throat curves like a cloud to the land
5170,SONG OF WOMEN,Where her breasts begin.
5171,SONG OF WOMEN,I close my eyes when I put my hand
5172,SONG OF WOMEN,On her breast's white skin.
5173,SONG OF WOMEN,
5174,SONG OF WOMEN,The flesh of women is like the sky
5175,SONG OF WOMEN,When bare is the moon:
5176,SONG OF WOMEN,"Rhythm of backs, hollow of necks,"
5177,SONG OF WOMEN,And sea-shell loins.
5178,SONG OF WOMEN,I know a woman whose splendors vex
5179,SONG OF WOMEN,Where the flesh joins--
5180,SONG OF WOMEN,A slope of light and a circumflex
5181,SONG OF WOMEN,Of clefts and coigns.
5182,SONG OF WOMEN,She thrills like the air when silence wrecks
5183,SONG OF WOMEN,An ended tune.
5184,SONG OF WOMEN,
5185,SONG OF WOMEN,These are the things not made by hands in the earth:
5186,SONG OF WOMEN,"Water and fire,"
5187,SONG OF WOMEN,"The air of heaven, and springs afresh,"
5188,SONG OF WOMEN,And love's desire.
5189,SONG OF WOMEN,"And a thing not made is a woman's flesh,"
5190,SONG OF WOMEN,Sorrow and mirth!
5191,SONG OF WOMEN,"She tightens the strings on the lyric lyre,"
5192,SONG OF WOMEN,And she drips the wine.
5193,SONG OF WOMEN,Her breasts bud out as pink and nesh
5194,SONG OF WOMEN,As buds on the vine:
5195,SONG OF WOMEN,"For fire and water and air are flesh,"
5196,SONG OF WOMEN,And love is the shrine.
5197,SONG OF WOMEN,

5199,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT
5200,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,
5201,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,How beautiful is the human spirit
5202,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,In its vase of clay!
5203,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,It takes no thought of the chary dole
5204,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,Of the light of day.
5205,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,"It labors and loves, as it were a soul"
5206,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,Whom the gods repay
5207,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,"With length of life, and a golden goal"
5208,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,At the end of the way.
5209,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,
5210,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,"There are souls I know who arch a dome,"
5211,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,And tunnel a hill.
5212,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,"They chisel in marble and fashion in chrome,"
5213,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,And measure the sky.
5214,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,"They find the good and destroy the ill,"
5215,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,And they bend and ply
5216,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,The laws of nature out of a will
5217,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,While the fates deny.
5218,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,
5219,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,I wonder and worship the human spirit
5220,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,When I behold
5221,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,"Numbers and symbols, and how they reach"
5222,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,Through steel and gold;
5223,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,"A harp, a battle-ship, thought and speech,"
5224,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,And an hour foretold.
5225,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,"It ponders its nature to turn and teach,"
5226,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,And itself to mould.
5227,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,
5228,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,"The human spirit is God, no doubt,"
5229,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,Is flesh made the word:
5230,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,"Jesus, Beethoven and Raphael,"
5231,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,And the souls who heard
5232,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,Beyond the rim of the world the swell
5233,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,Of an ocean stirred
5234,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,By a Power on the waters inscrutable.
5235,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,There are souls who gird
5236,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,"Their loins in faith that the world is well,"
5237,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,In a faith unblurred.
5238,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,How beautiful is the human spirit--
5239,SONG OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,The flesh made the word!

5244,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE
5245,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,
5246,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,
5247,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"This way and that way measuring,"
5248,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"Sighting from tree to tree,"
5249,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And from the bend of the river.
5250,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,This must be the place where Black Eagle
5251,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Twelve hundred moons ago
5252,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"Stood with folded arms,"
5253,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,While a Pottawatomie father
5254,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"Plunged a knife in his heart,"
5255,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,For the murder of a son.
5256,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"Black Eagle stood with folded arms,"
5257,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"Slim, erect, firm, unafraid,"
5258,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"Looking into the distance, across the river."
5259,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"Then the knife flashed,"
5260,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Then the knife crashed through his ribs
5261,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And into his heart.
5262,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And like a wounded eagle's wings
5263,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"His arms fell, slowly unfolding,"
5264,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And he sank to death without a groan!
5265,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,
5266,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And my name is Black Eagle too.
5267,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"And I am of the spirit,"
5268,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And perhaps of the blood
5269,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Of that Black Eagle of old.
5270,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"I am naked and alone,"
5271,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,But very happy;
5272,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Being rich in spirit and in memories.
5273,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,I am very strong.
5274,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"I am very proud,"
5275,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"Brave, revengeful, passionate."
5276,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"No longer deceived, keen of eye,"
5277,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Wise in the ways of the tribes:
5278,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"A knower of winds, mists, rains, snows, changes."
5279,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"A knower of balsams, simples, blossoms, grains."
5280,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"A knower of poisonous leaves, deadly fungus, herries."
5281,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"A knower of harmless snakes,"
5282,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And the livid copperhead.
5283,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"Lastly a knower of the spirits,"
5284,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,For there are many spirits:
5285,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"Spirits of hidden lakes,"
5286,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And of pine forests.
5287,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"Spirits of the dunes,"
5288,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And of forested valleys.
5289,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"Spirits of rivers, mountains, fields,"
5290,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And great distances.
5291,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,There are many spirits
5292,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Under the Great Spirit.
5293,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Him I know not.
5294,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Him I only feel
5295,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,With closed eyes.
5296,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Or when I look from my bed of moss by the river
5297,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"At a sky of stars,"
5298,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,When the leaves of the oak are asleep.
5299,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,I will fill this birch bark full of writing
5300,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"And hide it in the cleft of an oak,"
5301,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Here where Black Eagle fell.
5302,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Decipher my story who can:
5303,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,
5304,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,When I was a boy of fourteen
5305,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"Tobacco Jim, who owned many dogs,"
5306,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Rose from the door of his tent
5307,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"And came to where we were running,"
5308,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"Young Coyote, Rattler, Little Fox,"
5309,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And said to me in their hearing:
5310,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"""You are the fastest of all."
5311,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"Now run again, and let me see."
5312,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And if you can run
5313,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"I will make you my runner,"
5314,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"I will care for you,"
5315,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"And you shall have pockets of gold."" ..."
5316,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,
5317,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And then we ran.
5318,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"And the others lagged behind me,"
5319,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Like smoke behind the wind.
5320,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"But the faces of Young Coyote, Rattler, Little Fox"
5321,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Grew dark.
5322,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,They nudged each other.
5323,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"They looked side-ways,"
5324,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Toeing the earth in shame. ...
5325,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Then Tobacco Jim took me and trained me.
5326,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And he went here and there
5327,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,To find a match.
5328,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"And to get wagers of ponies, nuggets of copper,"
5329,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And nuggets of gold.
5330,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And at last the match was made.
5331,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,
5332,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"It was under a sky as blue as the cup of a harebell,"
5333,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"It was by a red and yellow mountain,"
5334,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,It was by a great river
5335,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,That we ran.
5336,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Hundreds of Indians came to the race.
5337,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"They babbled, smoked and quarreled."
5338,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"And everyone carried a knife,"
5339,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And everyone carried a gun.
5340,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And we runners--
5341,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,How young we were and unknowing
5342,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,What the race meant to them!
5343,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"For we saw nothing but the track,"
5344,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,We saw nothing but our trainers
5345,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And the starters.
5346,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And I saw no one but Tobacco Jim.
5347,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"But the Indians and the squaws saw much else,"
5348,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,They thought of the race in such different ways
5349,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,From the way we thought of it.
5350,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"For with me it was honor,"
5351,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"It was triumph,"
5352,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,It was fame.
5353,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,It was the tender looks of Indian maidens
5354,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Wherever I went.
5355,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"But now I know that to Tobacco Jim,"
5356,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And the old fathers and young bucks
5357,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"The race meant jugs of whiskey,"
5358,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And new guns.
5359,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"It meant a squaw,"
5360,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"A pony,"
5361,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Or some rise in the life of the tribe.
5362,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,
5363,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"So the shot of the starter rang at last,"
5364,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And we were off.
5365,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,I wore a band of yellow around my brow
5366,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"With an eagle's feather in it,"
5367,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And a red strap for my loins.
5368,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And as I ran the feather fluttered and sang:
5369,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"""You are the swiftest runner, Black Eagle,"
5370,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"They are all behind you."""
5371,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"And they were all behind me,"
5372,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,As the cloud's shadow is behind
5373,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,The bend of the grass under the wind.
5374,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,But as we neared the end of the race
5375,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"The onlookers, the gamblers, the old Indians,"
5376,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"And the young bucks,"
5377,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Crowded close to the track--
5378,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,I fell and lost.
5379,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,
5380,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Next day Tobacco Jim went about
5381,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Lamenting his losses.
5382,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And when I told him they tripped me
5383,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,He cursed them.
5384,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,But later he went about asking in whispers
5385,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,If I was wise enough to throw the race.
5386,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Then suddenly he disappeared.
5387,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"And we heard rumors of his riches,"
5388,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"Of his dogs and ponies,"
5389,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And of the joyous life he was leading.
5390,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,
5391,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"Then my father took me to New Mexico,"
5392,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And here my life changed.
5393,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"I was no longer the runner,"
5394,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,I had forgotten it all.
5395,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,I had become a wise Indian.
5396,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,I could do many things.
5397,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,I could read the white man's writing
5398,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And write it.
5399,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,
5400,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And Indians flocked to me:
5401,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"Billy the Pelican, Hooked Nosed Weasel,"
5402,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"Hungry Mole, Big Jawed Prophet,"
5403,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And many others.
5404,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"They flocked to me, for I could help them."
5405,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"For the Great Spirit may pick a chief,"
5406,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Or a leader.
5407,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,But sometimes the chief rises
5408,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,By using wise Indians like me
5409,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Who are rich in gifts and powers ...
5410,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,But at least it is true:
5411,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,All little great Indians
5412,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"Who are after ponies,"
5413,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Jugs of whiskey and soft blankets
5414,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Gain their ends through the gifts and powers
5415,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Of wise Indians like me.
5416,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"They come to you and ask you to do this,"
5417,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And to do that.
5418,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"And you do it, because it would be small"
5419,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Not to do it.
5420,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And until all the cards are laid on the table
5421,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"You do not see what they were after,"
5422,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And then you see:
5423,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,They have won your friend away;
5424,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,They have stolen your hill;
5425,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,They have taken your place at the feast;
5426,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,They are wearing your feathers;
5427,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,They have much gold.
5428,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"And you are tired, and without laughter."
5429,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"And they drift away from you,"
5430,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,As Tobacco Jim went away from me.
5431,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And you hear of them as rich and great.
5432,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,"And then you move on to another place,"
5433,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And another life.
5434,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,
5435,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Billy the Pelican has built him a board house
5436,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And lives in Guthrie.
5437,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Hook Nosed Weasel is a Justice of the Peace.
5438,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Hungry Mole had his picture in the Denver News;
5439,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,He is helping the government
5440,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,To reclaim stolen lands.
5441,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,(Many have told me it was Hungry Mole
5442,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Who tripped me in the race.)
5443,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Big Jawed Prophet is very rich.
5444,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,He has disappeared as an eagle
5445,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,With a rabbit.
5446,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And I have come back here
5447,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Where twelve hundred moons ago
5448,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Black Eagle before me
5449,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Had the knife run through his ribs
5450,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,And through his heart. ...
5451,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,
5452,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,I will hide this writing
5453,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,In the cleft of the oak
5454,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,By this bend in the river.
5455,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,Let him read who can:
5456,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,I was a swift runner whom they tripped.
5457,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,
5458,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,
5459,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,
5460,BLACK EAGLE RETURNS TO ST. JOE,

5469,I,And all the cities
5470,I,Are one with the plains again.
5471,I,"And the beauty of bronze,"
5472,I,And the strength of steel
5473,I,"Are blown over silent continents,"

5484,II,Drifts and falls through the void--

5491,THE BLIND,THE BLIND
5492,THE BLIND,
5493,THE BLIND,"Amid the din of cars and automobiles,"
5494,THE BLIND,"At the corner of a towering pile of granite,"
5495,THE BLIND,"Under the city's soaring brick and stone,"
5496,THE BLIND,"Where multitudes go hurrying by, you stand"
5497,THE BLIND,With eyeless sockets playing on a flute.
5498,THE BLIND,"And an old woman holds the cup for you,"
5499,THE BLIND,Wherein a curious passer by at times
5500,THE BLIND,Casts a poor coin.
5501,THE BLIND,
5502,THE BLIND,You are so blind you cannot see us men
5503,THE BLIND,As walking trees!
5504,THE BLIND,I fancy from the tune
5505,THE BLIND,"You play upon the flute, you have a vision"
5506,THE BLIND,"Of leafy trees along a country road-side,"
5507,THE BLIND,Where wheat is growing and the meadow-larks
5508,THE BLIND,Rise singing in the sun-shine!
5509,THE BLIND,In your darkness
5510,THE BLIND,You may see such things playing on your flute
5511,THE BLIND,Here in the granite ways of mad Chicago!
5512,THE BLIND,

5686,I,I
5687,I,
5688,I,"What will happen, Widow La Rue?"
5689,I,For last night at three o'clock
5690,I,You woke and saw by your window again
5691,I,Amid the shadowy locust grove
5692,I,The phantom of the old soldier:
5693,I,"A shadow of blue, like mercury light--"
5694,I,"What will happen, Widow La Rue?"
5695,I,
5696,I,*       *       *       *       *
5697,I,
5698,I,What may not happen
5699,I,In this place of summer loneliness?
5700,I,"For neither the sunlight of July,"
5701,I,"Nor the blue of the lake,"
5702,I,"Nor the green boundaries of cool woodlands,"
5703,I,"Nor the song of larks and thrushes,"
5704,I,"Nor the bravuras of bobolinks,"
5705,I,"Nor scents of hay new mown,"
5706,I,"Nor the ox-blood sumach cones,"
5707,I,"Nor the snow of nodding yarrow,"
5708,I,Nor clover blossoms on the dizzy crest
5709,I,Of the bluff by the lake
5710,I,Can take away the loneliness
5711,I,Of this July by the lake!
5712,I,
5713,I,*       *       *       *       *
5714,I,
5715,I,Last night you saw the old soldier
5716,I,"By your window, Widow La Rue!"
5717,I,"Or was it your husband you saw,"
5718,I,As he lay by the gate so long ago?
5719,I,"With the iris of his eyes so black,"
5720,I,"And the white of his eyes so china-blue,"
5721,I,"And specks of blood on his face,"
5722,I,Like a wall specked by a shake a brush;
5723,I,"And something like blubber or pinkish wax,"
5724,I,Hiding the gash in his throat----
5725,I,The serum and blood blown up by the breath
5726,I,From emptied lungs.
5727,I,
5728,I,
5729,II,II
5730,II,
5731,II,So Widow La Rue has gone to a friend
5732,II,"For the afternoon and the night,"
5733,II,"Where the phantom will not come,"
5734,II,Where the phantom may be forgotten.
5735,II,"And scarcely has she turned the road,"
5736,II,"Round the water-mill by the creek,"
5737,II,When the telephone rings and daughter Flora
5738,II,Springs up from a drowsy chair
5739,II,"And the ennui of a book,"
5740,II,And runs to answer the call.
5741,II,"And her heart gives a bound,"
5742,II,"And her heart stops still,"
5743,II,"As she hears the voice, and a faintness courses"
5744,II,Quick as poison through all her frame.
5745,II,And something like bees swarming in her breast
5746,II,"Comes to her throat in a surge of fear,"
5747,II,"Rapture, passion, for what is the voice"
5748,II,But the voice of her lover?
5749,II,And just because she is here alone
5750,II,In this desolate summer-house by the lake;
5751,II,And just because this man is forbidden
5752,II,"To cross her way, for a taint in his blood"
5753,II,"Of drink, from a father who died of drink;"
5754,II,And just because he is in her thought
5755,II,"By night and day,"
5756,II,The voice of him heats her through like fire.
5757,II,"She sways from dizziness,"
5758,II,The telephone falls from her shaking hand. ...
5759,II,"He is in the village, is walking out,"
5760,II,He will be at the door in an hour.
5761,II,
5762,II,
5763,III,III
5764,III,
5765,III,The sun is half a hand above the lake
5766,III,In a sky of lemon-dust down to the purple vastness.
5767,III,On the dizzy crest of the bluff the balls of clover
5768,III,Bow in the warm wind blowing across a meadow
5769,III,Where hay-cocks stand new-piled by the harvesters
5770,III,Clear to the forest of pine and beech at the meadow's end.
5771,III,A robin on the tip of a poplar's spire
5772,III,Sings to the sinking sun and the evening planet.
5773,III,Over the olive green of the darkening forest
5774,III,A thin moon slits the sky and down the road
5775,III,Two lovers walk.
5776,III,
5777,III,It is night when they reappear
5778,III,"From the forest, walking the hay-field over."
5779,III,And the sky is so full of stars it seems
5780,III,"Like a field of buckwheat. And the lovers look up,"
5781,III,"Then stand entranced under the silence of stars,"
5782,III,And in the silence of the scented hay-field
5783,III,Blurred only by a lisp of the listless water
5784,III,A hundred feet below.
5785,III,"And at last they sit by a cock of hay,"
5786,III,"As warm as the nest of a bird,"
5787,III,"Hand clasped in hand and silent,"
5788,III,Large-eyed and silent.
5789,III,
5790,III,*       *       *       *       *
5791,III,
5792,III,"O, daughter Flora!"
5793,III,"Delicious weakness is on you now,"
5794,III,With your lover's face above you.
5795,III,"You can scarcely lift your hand,"
5796,III,Or turn your head
5797,III,Pillowed upon the fragrant hay.
5798,III,You dare not open your moistened eyes
5799,III,"For fear of this sky of stars,"
5800,III,For fear of your lover's eyes.
5801,III,The trance of nature has taken you
5802,III,Rocked on creation's tide.
5803,III,"And the kinship you feel for this man,"
5804,III,Confessed this night--so often confessed
5805,III,And wondered at--
5806,III,Has coiled its final sorcery about you.
5807,III,"You do not know what it is,"
5808,III,"Nor care what it is,"
5809,III,"Nor care what fate is to come,--"
5810,III,The night has you.
5811,III,"You only move white, fainting hands"
5812,III,"Against his strength, then let them fall."
5813,III,Your lips are parted over set teeth;
5814,III,A dewy moisture with the aroma of a woman's body
5815,III,"Maddens your lover,"
5816,III,And in a swift and terrible moment
5817,III,The mystery of love is unveiled to you. ...
5818,III,
5819,III,Then your lover sits up with a sigh.
5820,III,But you lie there so still with closed eyes.
5821,III,"So content, scarcely breathing under that ocean of stars."
5822,III,"A night bird calls, and a vagrant zephyr"
5823,III,"Stirs your uncoiled hair on your bare bosom,"
5824,III,But you do not move.
5825,III,And the sun comes up at last
5826,III,"Finding you asleep in his arms,"
5827,III,There by the hay cock.
5828,III,"And he kisses your tears away,"
5829,III,"And redeems his word of last night,"
5830,III,For down to the village you go
5831,III,"And take your vows before the Pastor there,"
5832,III,And then return to the summer house. ...
5833,III,All is well.
5834,III,
5835,III,
5836,IV,IV
5837,IV,
5838,IV,Widow La Rue has returned
5839,IV,And is rocking on the porch--
5840,IV,What is about to happen?
5841,IV,For last night the phantom of the old soldier
5842,IV,Appeared to her again--
5843,IV,"It followed her to the house of her friend,"
5844,IV,And appeared again.
5845,IV,"But more than ever was it her husband,"
5846,IV,"With the iris of his eyes so black,"
5847,IV,And the white of his eyes so china-blue.
5848,IV,"And while she thinks of it,"
5849,IV,"And wonders what is about to happen,"
5850,IV,"She hears laughter,"
5851,IV,"And looking up, beholds her daughter"
5852,IV,And the forbidden lover.
5853,IV,
5854,IV,*       *       *       *       *
5855,IV,
5856,IV,And then the daughter and her husband
5857,IV,Come to the porch and the daughter says
5858,IV,"""We have just been married in the village, mother;"
5859,IV,Will you forgive us?
5860,IV,"This is your son; you must kiss your son."""
5861,IV,And Widow La Rue from her chair arises
5862,IV,"And calmly takes her child in her arms,"
5863,IV,And clasps his hand.
5864,IV,And after gazing upon him
5865,IV,Imperturbably as Clytemnestra looked
5866,IV,"Upon returning Agamemnon,"
5867,IV,"With a light in her eyes which neither fathomed,"
5868,IV,"She kissed him,"
5869,IV,And in a calm voice blessed them.
5870,IV,"Then sent her daughter, singing,"
5871,IV,On an errand back to the village
5872,IV,"To market for dinner, saying:"
5873,IV,"""We'll talk over plans, my dear."""
5874,IV,
5875,IV,
5876,V,V
5877,V,
5878,V,And the young husband
5879,V,Rocks on the porch without a thought
5880,V,Of the lightning about to strike.
5881,V,"And like Clytemnestra, Widow La Rue"
5882,V,Enters the house.
5883,V,"And while he is rocking, with all his spirit in a rythmic rapture,"
5884,V,The Widow La Rue takes a seat in the room
5885,V,"By a window back of the chair where he rocks,"
5886,V,And drawing the shade
5887,V,She speaks:
5888,V,
5889,V,"""These two nights past I have seen the phantom of the old soldier"
5890,V,Who haunts the midnights
5891,V,Of this summer loneliness.
5892,V,And I knew that a doom was at hand. ...
5893,V,"You have married my daughter, and this is the doom. ..."
5894,V,"O, God in heaven!"""
5895,V,Then a horror as of a writhing whiteness
5896,V,Winds out of the July glare
5897,V,"And stops the flow of his blood,"
5898,V,As he hears from the re-echoing room
5899,V,The voice of Widow La Rue
5900,V,Moving darkly between banks
5901,V,Of delirious fear and woe!
5902,V,
5903,V,"""Be calm till you hear me through. ..."
5904,V,"Do not move, or enter here,"
5905,V,I am hiding my face from you. ...
5906,V,"Hear me through, and then fly."
5907,V,"I warned her against you, but how could I tell her"
5908,V,Why you were not for her?
5909,V,"But tell me now, have you come together?"
5910,V,No? Thank God for that. ...
5911,V,For you must not come together. ...
5912,V,Now listen while I whisper to you:
5913,V,My daughter was born of a lawless love
5914,V,"For a man I loved before I married,"
5915,V,"And when, for five years, no child came"
5916,V,I went to this man
5917,V,And begged him to give me a child. ...
5918,V,"Well then ... the child was born, your wife as it seems. ..."
5919,V,"And when my husband saw her,"
5920,V,And saw the likeness of this man in her face
5921,V,"He went out of the house, where they found him later"
5922,V,By the entrance gate
5923,V,"With the iris of his eyes so black,"
5924,V,"And the white of his eyes so china-blue,"
5925,V,"And specks of blood on his face,"
5926,V,Like a wall specked by a shake of a brush.
5927,V,And something like blubber or pinkish wax
5928,V,Hiding the gash in his throat--
5929,V,The serum and blood blown up by the breath
5930,V,"From emptied lungs. Yes, there by the gate, O God!"
5931,V,Quit rocking your chair! Don't you understand?
5932,V,Quit rocking your chair! Go! Go!

5979,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,We find it caused by morphological

5982,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Basis, if one be, escapes detection."
5983,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,For many functions of the cortex are
5984,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Unknown, as I have said."
5985,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,
5986,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,And now remember
5987,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Mercier's analysis of heredity:
5988,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Besides direct transmission of unstable
5989,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Nervous systems, there remains the law"
5990,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Hereditary of sanguinity.
5991,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Then here's another matter: Parents may
5992,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Have normal nervous systems, yet produce"
5993,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Children of abnormal nerves and minds,"
5994,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Caused by unsuitable sexual germs.
5995,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Let me repeat before I leave the matter
5996,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,The factors in a perfect organization:
5997,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,First quality in the germ producing matter;
5998,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Then quality in the sperm producing force,"
5999,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,And lastly relative fitness of the two.

6016,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,To resume:
6017,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,A child may take the qualities of one parent
6018,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"In some respects, and of the other parent"
6019,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,In some respects. A child may have the traits
6020,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Of father at one period of his life,"
6021,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,The mother at one period of his life.
6022,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,And if the parents' traits are similar
6023,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Their traits may be prepotent in a child,"
6024,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Thus giving rise to qualities convergent.
6025,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,So if you take a circle and draw off
6026,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,A line which would become another circle
6027,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"If drawn enough, completed, but is left"

6032,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"A perfect circle can be small, you know."
6033,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,And so John has good sense within his sphere.
6034,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,But if some force began to work like yeast
6035,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"In brain cells, and his mind shot forth a line"
6036,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"To make a larger thinking circle, say"
6037,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"About a great invention, heaven or God,"
6038,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Then John would be abnormal, till this line"
6039,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Shot round and joined, became a larger circle."
6040,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"This is the secret of eccentric genius,"
6041,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"The man is half a sphere, sticks out in space"

6044,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Half something new and greater. If we looked
6045,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,To John's heredity we'd find this change
6046,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Was manifest in mother or in father
6047,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"About the self-same period of life,"
6048,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Most likely in his father. Attributes

6052,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Now this morning
6053,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,I take up paranoia. Paranoics
6054,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Are often noted for great gifts of mind.
6055,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Mahomet, Swedenborg were paranoics,"
6056,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Joan of Arc, and Ossawatomie Brown,"
6057,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Cellini, many others. All who think"
6058,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Themselves inspired of God, and all who see"
6059,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Themselves appointed to a work, the subjects"
6060,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Of prophecies are paranoics. All
6061,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Who visions have of God or archangels,"
6062,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Hear voices or celestial music, these"
6063,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Are paranoics. And whether it be they rise
6064,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Enough above the earth to look along
6065,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"A longer arc and see realities,"
6066,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Or see strange things through atmospheric strata
6067,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Which build up or distort the things they see
6068,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Remains the question. Let us wait the proof.
6069,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,
6070,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Last week I told you I would have to-day
6071,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"The skull and brain of Jacob Groesbell here,"
6072,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,And lecture on his case. Here is the brain:
6073,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Weight sixteen hundred grammes. Students may look
6074,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,After the lecture at the brain and skull.
6075,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,There's nothing anatomical at fault
6076,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"With this fine brain, so far as I can find."
6077,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"You'll note how deep the convolutions are,"
6078,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Arrangement quite symmetrical. The skull
6079,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Is well formed too. The jaws are long you'll note,"
6080,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,The palate roof somewhat asymmetrical.
6081,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,But this is scarce significant. Let me tell
6082,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,How Jacob Groesbell looked:
6083,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,
6084,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"The man was tall,"
6085,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Had shapely hands and feet, but awkward limbs."
6086,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"His hair was brown and fine, his forehead high,"
6087,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"And ran back at an angle, temples full."
6088,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"His nose was long and fleshy at the point,"
6089,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Was tilted to one side. His eyes were gray,"
6090,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,The iris flecked. They looked as if a light
6091,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,As of a sun-set shone behind them. Ears
6092,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Were very large, projected at right angles."
6093,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"His neck was slender, womanish. His skin"
6094,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Of finest texture, white and very smooth."
6095,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"His voice was quiet, musical. His manner"
6096,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Patient and gentle, modest, reasonable."
6097,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"His parents, as I learned through inquiry,"
6098,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Were Methodists, devout and greatly loved."
6099,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,The mother healthy both in mind and body.
6100,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"The father was eccentric, perhaps insane."
6101,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,They were first cousins.
6102,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,
6103,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,I knew Jacob Groesbell
6104,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Ten years before he died. I knew him first
6105,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,When he was sent to mend my porch. A workman
6106,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,With saw and hammer never excelled him. Then
6107,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,As time went on I saw him when he came
6108,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,At my request to do my carpentry.
6109,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"I grew to know him, and by slow degrees"
6110,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"He told me of his readings in the Bible,"
6111,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,And gave me his interpretations. At last
6112,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Aged forty-six, had ulcers of the stomach,"
6113,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Which took him off. He sent for me, and said"
6114,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"He wished me to attend him, which I did."
6115,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,He told me I could have his body and brain
6116,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"To lecture on, dissect, since some had said"
6117,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"He was insane, he told me, and if so"
6118,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,I should find something wrong with brain or body.
6119,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,And if I found a wrong then all his visions
6120,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Of God and archangels were just the fancies
6121,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,That come to madmen. So he made provision
6122,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"To give his brain and body for this cause,"
6123,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"And here's his brain and skull, and I am lecturing"
6124,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,On Jacob Groesbell as a paranoic.
6125,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,
6126,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"As I have said before, in making tests"
6127,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"And observations of the patient, have"
6128,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"His conversation taken stenographically,"
6129,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"In order to preserve his speech exactly,"
6130,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,And catch the flow if he becomes excited.
6131,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"So we determine if he makes new words,"
6132,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"If he be incoherent, or repeats."
6133,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,I took my secretary once to make
6134,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,A stenographic record. Strange enough
6135,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,He would not talk while she was writing down.
6136,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"And when I asked him why, he would not tell."
6137,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"So I devised a scheme: I took a satchel,"
6138,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"And put in it a dictaphone, and when"
6139,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,A cylinder was full I'd stoop and put
6140,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"My hand among my bottles in the satchel,"
6141,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"As if I was compounding medicine,"
6142,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Instead I'd put another cylinder on.
6143,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"And thus I got his story in his voice,"
6144,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Just as he talked, with nothing lost at all,"
6145,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Which you shall hear. For with this megaphone
6146,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,The students in the farthest gallery
6147,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Can hear what Jacob Groesbell said to me,"
6148,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,And weigh the thought that stirred within the brain
6149,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Here in this jar beside me. Listen now
6150,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,To Jacob Groesbell's voice:
6151,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,
6152,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"""Will you repeat"
6153,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,From the beginning connectedly the story
6154,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Of your religious life, illumination,"
6155,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Vhat you have called your soul's escape?"""
6156,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,
6157,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"""I will,"
6158,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Since I shall never tell it again."""
6159,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,
6160,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"""I grew up"
6161,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Timid and sensitive, not very strong,"
6162,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Not understood of father or of mother.
6163,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"They did not love me, and I never felt"
6164,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,A tenderness for them. I used to quote:
6165,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,'Who is my mother and who are my brothers?'
6166,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,At school I was not liked. I had a chum
6167,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"From time to time, that's all. And I remember"
6168,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,My mother on a day put with my luncheon
6169,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"A bottle of milk, and when the noon hour came"
6170,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"I missed it, found some boys had taken it,"
6171,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"And when I asked for it, they made the cry:"
6172,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"'Bottle of milk, bottle of milk,' and I"
6173,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Flushed through with shame, and cried, and to this hour"
6174,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"It hurts me to remember it. Such days,"
6175,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,All misery! For all my clothes were patched.
6176,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,They hooted at me. So I lived alone.
6177,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"At twelve years old I had great fears of death,"
6178,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"And hell, heard devils in my room. One night"
6179,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"During a thunderstorm heard clanking chains,"
6180,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,And hid beneath the pillows. One spring day
6181,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,As I was walking on the village street
6182,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Close to the church I heard a voice which said
6183,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"'Behold, my son'--and falling on my knees"
6184,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,I prayed in ecstacy--but as I prayed
6185,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Some passing school boys laughed, threw stones at me."
6186,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"A heat ran through me, I arose and fled."
6187,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Well, then I joined the church and was baptized."
6188,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"But something left me in the ceremony,"
6189,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"I lost my ecstacy, seemed slipping back"
6190,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Into the trap. I took to wandering
6191,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"In solitary places, could not bear"
6192,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,To see a human face. I slept for nights
6193,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"In still ravines, or meadows. But one time"
6194,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Returning to my home, I found the room"
6195,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Filled up with visitors--my heart stopped short,"
6196,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,And glancing at the faces of my parents
6197,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"I hurried, bolted through, and did not speak,"
6198,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Entered a bed-room door and closed it. So
6199,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"I tell this just to illustrate my shyness,"
6200,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Which cursed my youth and made me miserable,"
6201,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Something I fought but could not overcome.
6202,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,And pondering on the Scriptures I could see
6203,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"How I resembled the saints, our Saviour even,"
6204,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,How even as my brothers called me mad
6205,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,They called our Saviour so.
6206,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,
6207,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"""At fourteen years"
6208,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"My father taught me carpentry, his trade,"
6209,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,And made me work with him. I seemed to be
6210,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,The butt for jokes and laughter with the men--
6211,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,I know not why. For now and then they'd drop
6212,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"A word that showed they knew my secrets, knew"
6213,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"I had heard voices, knew I loathed the lusts"
6214,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Of women, drink. Oh these were sorry years,"
6215,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,God was not with me though I sought Him ever
6216,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,And I was persecuted for His sake. My brain
6217,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Seemed like to burst at times, saw sparkling lights,"
6218,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Heard music, voices, made strange shapes of leaves,"
6219,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Clouds, trunks of trees,--illusions of the devil."
6220,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,I was turned twenty years when on an evening
6221,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Calm, beautiful in June, after a day"
6222,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Of healthful toil, while sitting on the porch,"
6223,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"The sun just sinking, at my left I heard"
6224,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"A voice of hollow clearness: ""You are Christ."""
6225,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,My eyes grew blind with tears for the evil
6226,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Of such a thought, soul stained with such a thought,"
6227,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"So devil stained, soul damned with blasphemy."
6228,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,I ran into my room and seized a pistol
6229,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,To end my life. God willed it otherwise.
6230,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,I fainted and awoke upon the floor
6231,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,After some hours. To heap my suffering full
6232,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,A few days after this while in the village
6233,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,I went into a store. The friendly clerk--
6234,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,I knew him always--said 'What will you have?
6235,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,I wait first always on the little boys.'
6236,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,I laughed and went my way. But in an hour
6237,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"His saying rankled, I began to brood"
6238,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"On ways of vengeance, till it seemed at last"
6239,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"His life must pay. O, soul so full of sin,"
6240,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"So devil tangled, tortured--which not prayer"
6241,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Nor watching could deliver. So I thought
6242,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,To save my soul from murder I must fly--
6243,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,I felt an urging as one does in sleep
6244,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Pursued by giant things to fly, to fly"
6245,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"From terror, death, from blankness on the scene,"
6246,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"From emptiness, from beauty gone. The world"
6247,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Seemed something seen in fever, where the steps"
6248,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Of men are muffled, and a futile scheme"
6249,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Impels all steps. So packing up my kit,"
6250,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"My Bible in my pocket, secretly"
6251,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,I disappeared. Next day took up my life
6252,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"In Barrington, a village thirty miles"
6253,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"From all I knew, besides a lovely lake,"
6254,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Reached by a road that crossed a bridge
6255,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Over a little bay, the bridge's ends"
6256,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Clustered with boats for fishermen. And here
6257,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Night after night I fished, or stood and watched"
6258,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,The star-light on the water.
6259,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,
6260,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,I grew calmer
6261,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Almost found peace, got work to do, and lived"
6262,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Under a widow's roof, who was devout"
6263,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"And knew my love for God. Now listen, doctor,"
6264,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"To every word: I was now twenty-five,"
6265,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"In perfect health, no longer persecuted,"
6266,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"At peace with all the world, if not my soul"
6267,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Had wholly found its peace, for truth to tell"
6268,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"It had an ache which sometimes I could feel,"
6269,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,And yet I had this soul awakening.
6270,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"I know I have been counted mad, so watch"
6271,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Each detail here and judge.
6272,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,
6273,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,At four o'clock
6274,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"The thirtieth day of June, my work being done,"
6275,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,My kit upon my back I walked this road
6276,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Toward the village. 'Twas an afternoon
6277,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Of clouds, no rain, a little breeze, the tinkle"
6278,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Of cow bells in the air, a heavenly silence"
6279,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Pervading nature. Reaching the hill's foot
6280,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"I sat down by a tree to rest, enjoy"
6281,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"The greenness of the forests, meadows, flats"
6282,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Along the bay, the blueness of the lake,"
6283,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"The ripple of the water at my feet,"
6284,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,The rythmic babble of the little boats
6285,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Tied to the bridge. And as I sat there musing,"
6286,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Myself lost in the self, in time the clouds"
6287,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Lifted, blew off, to let the sun go down"
6288,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Over the waters gloriously to rest.
6289,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"So as I stared upon the sun on the water,"
6290,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Some minutes, though I know not for how long,"
6291,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Out of the splendor of the shining sun
6292,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Upon the water, Jesus of Nazareth"
6293,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Clothed all in white, the nimbus round his brow,"
6294,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"His face all wisdom, love, rose to my view,"
6295,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"And then he spake: 'Jacob, my son, arise"
6296,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,And come with me.'
6297,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,
6298,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"""And in an instant there"
6299,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Something fell from me, I became a cloud,"
6300,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,A soul with wings. A glory burned about me.
6301,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,And in that glory I perceived all things:
6302,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"I saw the eternal wheels, the deepest secrets"
6303,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Of creatures, herbs and grass, and stars and suns"
6304,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"And I knew God, and knew all things as God:"
6305,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"The All loving, the Perfect One, the Perfect Wisdom,"
6306,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Truth, love and purity. And in that instant"
6307,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Atoms and molecules I saw, and faces,"
6308,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"And how they are arranged order to order,"
6309,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"With no break in the order, one harmonious"
6310,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Whole of universal life all blended
6311,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,And interfused with universal love.
6312,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"And as it was with Shelley so I cried,"
6313,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,And clasped my hands in ecstacy and rose
6314,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"And started back to climb the hill again,"
6315,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Scarce knowing, neither caring what I did,"
6316,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Nor where I went, and thinking if this be"
6317,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,A fancy only of the Saviour then
6318,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"He will not follow me, and if it be"
6319,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Himself, indeed, he will not let me fall"
6320,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,After the revelation. As I reached
6321,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"The brow of the hill, I felt his presence with me"
6322,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"And turned, and saw Him. 'Thou hast faith, my son,"
6323,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Who knowest me, when they who walked with me"
6324,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Toward Emmaus knew me not, to whom I told"
6325,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"All secrets of the scriptures beginning at Moses,"
6326,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Who knew me not till I brake bread and then,"
6327,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"As after thought could say, Did not our heart"
6328,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Within us burn while he talked. O, Jacob Groesbell,"
6329,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Thou carpenter, as I was, greatly blessed"
6330,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"With visions and my Father's love, this walk"
6331,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Is your walk toward Emmaus.' So he talked,"
6332,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Expounding all the scriptures, telling me"
6333,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,About the race of men who live and move
6334,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Along a life of meat and drink and sleep
6335,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"And comforts of the flesh, while here and there"
6336,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,A hungering soul is chosen to lift up
6337,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"And re-create the race. 'The prophet, poet"
6338,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Must seek and must find God to keep the race
6339,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Awake to the divine and to the orders
6340,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Of universal and harmonious life,"
6341,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"All interfused with Universal love,"
6342,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Which love is God, lest blindness, atheism,"
6343,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Which sees no order, reason, no intent"
6344,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Beat down the race to welter in the mire
6345,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"When storms, and floods come. And the sons of God,"
6346,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,The leaders of the race from age to age
6347,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Are chosen for their separate work, each work"
6348,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Fits in the given order. All who suffer
6349,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"The martyrdom of thought, whether they think"
6350,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Themselves as servants of my Father, or even"
6351,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Mock at the images and rituals
6352,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Which prophets of dead creeds did symbolize
6353,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"The mystery they sensed, or whether they be"
6354,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Spirits of laughter, logic, divination"
6355,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Of human life, the human soul, all men"
6356,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Who give their essence, blindly or in vision"
6357,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"In faith that life is worth their utmost love,"
6358,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,They are my brothers and my Father's sons.'
6359,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,So Jesus told me as we took my walk
6360,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Toward my Emmaus. After a time we turned
6361,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,And walked through heading rye and purple vetch
6362,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Into an orchard where great rows of pears
6363,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Sloped up a hill. It was now evening:
6364,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Stretches of scarlet clouds were in the west,"
6365,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,And a half moon was hanging just above
6366,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"The pears' white blossoms. O, that evening!"
6367,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,We came back to the boats at last and loosed
6368,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"One of them and rowed out into the bay,"
6369,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"And fished, while the stars appeared. He only said"
6370,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,'Whatever they did with me you too shall do.'
6371,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,A haziness came on me now. I seem
6372,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,To find myself alone there in that boat.
6373,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"At mid-night I awoke, the moon was sunk,"
6374,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,The whippoorwills were singing. I walked home
6375,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Back to the village in a silence, peace,"
6376,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,A happiness profound.
6377,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,
6378,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"""And the next morning"
6379,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"I awoke with aching head, spent body, yet"
6380,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,With spiritual vision so intense I looked
6381,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Through things material as if they were
6382,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,But shadows--old things passed away or grew
6383,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,A lovelier order. And my heart was full.
6384,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Infinitely I loved, and infinitely was loved."
6385,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"My landlady looked at me sharply, asked"
6386,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"What hour I entered, where I was so late."
6387,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,I only answered fishing. For I told
6388,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"No person of my vision, went my way"
6389,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"At carpentry in silence, in great joy."
6390,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"For archangels and powers were at my side,"
6391,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"They led me, bore me up, instructed me"
6392,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"In mysteries, and voices said to me"
6393,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,'Write' as the voice in Patmos said to John.
6394,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"I wrote and printed and the village read,"
6395,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,And called me mad. And so I grew to see
6396,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"The deepest truths of God, and God Himself,"
6397,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"The geniture of all things, of the Word"
6398,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Becoming flesh in Christ. I knew all ages,"
6399,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Times, empires, races, creeds, the human weakness"
6400,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Which makes life wearisome, confused and pained,"
6401,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,And how the search for something (it is God)
6402,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Makes divers worships, fire, the sun, and beasts"
6403,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Takes form in Eleusinian mysteries
6404,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Or festivals where sex, the vine, the Earth"
6405,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,At harvest time have praise or reverence.
6406,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"I knew God, talked with God, and knew that God"
6407,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Is more than Thought or Love. Our twisted brains
6408,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Are but the wires in the bulb which stays,"
6409,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Resists the current and makes human thought.
6410,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,As the electric current is not light
6411,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,But heat and power as well. Our little brains
6412,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Resist God and make thought and love as well.
6413,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,But God is more than these. Oh I heard much
6414,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Of music, heard the whirring as of wheels,"
6415,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Or buzzing as of ears when a room is still.
6416,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,That is the axis of profoundest life
6417,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Which turns and rests not. And I heard the cry
6418,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"And hearing wept, of man's soul, heard the ages,"
6419,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,The epochs of this earth as it were the feet
6420,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Of multitudes in corridors. And I knew
6421,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,The agony of genius and the woe
6422,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Of prophets and the great.
6423,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,
6424,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"""From that next morning"
6425,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,I searched the scriptures with more fervid zeal
6426,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Than I had ever done. I could not open
6427,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Its pages anywhere but I could find
6428,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Myself set forth or mirrored, pointed to."
6429,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,I could not doubt my destiny was bound
6430,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,With man's salvation. Jeremiah said
6431,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,'Take forth the precious from the vile.' Those words
6432,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"To me were spoken, and to no one else."
6433,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,And so I searched the scriptures. And I found
6434,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"I never had a thought, experience, pang,"
6435,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,A state in human life our Saviour had not.
6436,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"He was a carpenter, and so was I."
6437,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"He had his soul's illumination, so had I."
6438,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"His brethren called him mad, they called me mad."
6439,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"He triumphed over death, so shall I triumph."
6440,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"For I could, I can feel my way along"
6441,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Death's stages as a man can reach and feel
6442,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Ahead of him along a wall. I know
6443,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"This body is a shell, a butterfly's"
6444,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Excreta pushed away with rising wings.
6445,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,
6446,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"""I searched the scriptures. How should I believe"
6447,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Paul's story, not my own? Did he not see"
6448,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,At mid-day in the way a light from heaven
6449,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Above the brightness of the sun and hear
6450,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"The voice of Jesus saying to him 'Saul,'"
6451,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Why persecutest thou me?' And did not Festus,"
6452,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Before whom Paul stood speaking for himself,"
6453,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Call Paul a mad man? Even while he spake
6454,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Such words as none but men inspired can speak,"
6455,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"As well as words of truth and soberness,"
6456,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Such as myself speak now.
6457,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,
6458,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"""And from the scriptures"
6459,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,I passed to studies of the men who came
6460,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,To great illuminations. You will see
6461,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"There are two kinds: One's of the intellect,"
6462,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"The understanding, one is of the soul."
6463,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,The x-ray lets the eye behind the flesh
6464,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"To see the ribs, or heart beat, choose! So men"
6465,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,In their illumination see the frame-work
6466,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Of life or see its spirit, so align"
6467,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Themselves with Science, Satire, or align"
6468,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Themselves with Poetry or Prophecy.
6469,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"So being Aristotle, Rabelais,"
6470,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Paul, Swedenborg."
6471,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,
6472,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"""And as the years"
6473,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Went on, as I had time, was fortunate"
6474,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,In finding books I read of many men
6475,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Who had illumination, as I had it. Read"
6476,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Of Dante's vision, how he found himself"
6477,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Saw immortality, lost fear of death."
6478,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Read Swedenborg, who left the intellect"
6479,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"At fifty-four for God, and entered heaven"
6480,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Before he quitted life and saw behind
6481,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"The sun of fire, a sun of love and truth."
6482,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Read Whitman who exclaimed to God: 'Thou knowest
6483,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,My manhood's visionary meditations
6484,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Which come from Thee, the ardor and the urge."
6485,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Thou lightest my life with rays ineffable
6486,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Beyond all signs, descriptions, languages.'"
6487,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Read Blake, Spinoza, Emerson, read Wordsworth"
6488,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Who wrote of something 'deeply interfused,"
6489,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,"
6490,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"And the round ocean and the living air,"
6491,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"And the blue skies, and in the mind of man--"
6492,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,A motion and a spirit that impels
6493,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"All thinking things, all objects of all thought"
6494,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,And rolls through all things.'
6495,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,
6496,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"""And at last they called me"
6497,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"The mad, and learned carpenter. And then--"
6498,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"I'm growing faint. Your hand, hold ..."""
6499,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,
6500,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,At this point
6501,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"He fainted, sank into a stupor. There"
6502,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"I watched him, to discover if 'twas death."
6503,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"But soon I saw him rally, then he spoke."
6504,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"There was some other talk, but not of moment."
6505,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,I had to change the cylinder--the talk
6506,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Was broken, rambling, and of trifling things,"
6507,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,"Throws no light on the case, being sane enough."
6508,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,He died next morning.
6509,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,
6510,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,Students who desire
6511,DR. SCUDDER'S CLINICAL LECTURE,To examine the skull and brain may do so now

6562,FRIAR YVES,"Like yonder spring, an inner source"
6563,FRIAR YVES,"Of life, and need not dew or rain"
6564,FRIAR YVES,"Of human love, or human friends,"
6565,FRIAR YVES,And thus accomplish my soul's ends
6566,FRIAR YVES,"Within myself! No,"" said the friar;"
6567,FRIAR YVES,"""There is one water and one fire;"
6568,FRIAR YVES,"There is one Spirit, which is God."
6569,FRIAR YVES,And what are we but streams and springs
6570,FRIAR YVES,Through which He takes His wanderings?
6571,FRIAR YVES,"Lord, I am weak, I am afraid;"
6572,FRIAR YVES,"Show me the way!"" the friar prayed."
6573,FRIAR YVES,"""Where do I flow and to what end?"
6574,FRIAR YVES,"Am I of Thee, or do I blend"
6575,FRIAR YVES,"Hereafter with Thee?"""
6576,FRIAR YVES,
6577,FRIAR YVES,"Yves heard,"
6578,FRIAR YVES,"While praying, sounds as when the sod"
6579,FRIAR YVES,Teems with a swarm of insect things.
6580,FRIAR YVES,"He dropped his halberd to look down,"
6581,FRIAR YVES,"And then his waking vision blurred,"
6582,FRIAR YVES,As one before a light will frown.
6583,FRIAR YVES,His inner ear was caught and stirred
6584,FRIAR YVES,By voices; then the chestnut tree
6585,FRIAR YVES,Became a step beside a throne.
6586,FRIAR YVES,"Breathless he lay and fearfully,"
6587,FRIAR YVES,While on his brain a vision shone.
6588,FRIAR YVES,Said a Great Voice of sweetest tone:
6589,FRIAR YVES,"""The time has come when I must take"
6590,FRIAR YVES,The form of man for mankind's sake.
6591,FRIAR YVES,This drama is played long enough
6592,FRIAR YVES,"By creatures who have naught of me,"
6593,FRIAR YVES,Save what comes up from foam of the sea
6594,FRIAR YVES,"To crawling moss or swimming weeds,"
6595,FRIAR YVES,"At last to man. From heaven in flame,"
6596,FRIAR YVES,"Pure, whole, and vital, down I fly,"
6597,FRIAR YVES,"And take a mortal's form and name,"
6598,FRIAR YVES,"And labor for the race's needs."""
6599,FRIAR YVES,Then Friar Yves dreamed the sky
6600,FRIAR YVES,"Flushed like a bride's face rosily,"
6601,FRIAR YVES,And shot to lightning from its bloom.
6602,FRIAR YVES,"The world leaped like a babe in the womb,"
6603,FRIAR YVES,And choral voices from heaven's cope
6604,FRIAR YVES,Circled the earth like singing stars:
6605,FRIAR YVES,"""O wondrous hope, O sweetest hope,"
6606,FRIAR YVES,O passion realized at last;
6607,FRIAR YVES,"O end of hunger, fear, and wars,"
6608,FRIAR YVES,"O victory over the bottomless, vast"
6609,FRIAR YVES,"Valley of Death!"""
6610,FRIAR YVES,
6611,FRIAR YVES,"A silence fell,"
6612,FRIAR YVES,Broke by the voice of Gabriel:
6613,FRIAR YVES,"""Music may follow this, O Lord!"
6614,FRIAR YVES,Music I hear; I hear discord
6615,FRIAR YVES,"Through ages yet to be, as well."
6616,FRIAR YVES,"There will be wars because of this,"
6617,FRIAR YVES,And wars will come in its despite.
6618,FRIAR YVES,It's noon on the world now; blackest night
6619,FRIAR YVES,Will follow soon. And men will miss
6620,FRIAR YVES,"The meaning, Lord! There will be strife"
6621,FRIAR YVES,"'Twixt Montanist and Ebionite,"
6622,FRIAR YVES,"Gnostic, Mithraist, Manichean,"
6623,FRIAR YVES,'Twixt Christian and the Saracen.
6624,FRIAR YVES,There will be war to win the place
6625,FRIAR YVES,Where you bend death to sovereign life.
6626,FRIAR YVES,Armed kings will battle for the grace
6627,FRIAR YVES,"Of rulership, for power and gold"
6628,FRIAR YVES,In the name of Jesus. Men will hold
6629,FRIAR YVES,Conclaves of swords to win surcease
6630,FRIAR YVES,Of doctrines of the Prince of Peace.
6631,FRIAR YVES,"The seed is good, Lord, make the ground"
6632,FRIAR YVES,"Good for the seed you scatter round!"""
6633,FRIAR YVES,
6634,FRIAR YVES,Said the Great Voice of sweetest tone:
6635,FRIAR YVES,"""The gardener sprays his plants and trees"
6636,FRIAR YVES,To drive out lice and stop disease.
6637,FRIAR YVES,"After the spraying, fruit is grown"
6638,FRIAR YVES,Ruddy and plump. The shortened eyes
6639,FRIAR YVES,"Of men can see this end, although"
6640,FRIAR YVES,Leaves wither or a whole tree dies
6641,FRIAR YVES,From what the gardener does to grow
6642,FRIAR YVES,Apples and plums of sweeter flesh.
6643,FRIAR YVES,The gardener lives outside the tree;
6644,FRIAR YVES,The gardener knows the tree can see
6645,FRIAR YVES,"What cure is needed, plans afresh"
6646,FRIAR YVES,"An end foreseen, and there's the will"
6647,FRIAR YVES,Wherewith the gardener may fulfil
6648,FRIAR YVES,"The orchard's destiny."""
6649,FRIAR YVES,
6650,FRIAR YVES,So He spake.
6651,FRIAR YVES,"And Friar Yves seemed to wake,"
6652,FRIAR YVES,"But did not wake, and only sunk"
6653,FRIAR YVES,"Into another dreaming state,"
6654,FRIAR YVES,Wherein he saw a woman's form
6655,FRIAR YVES,Leaning against the chestnut's trunk.
6656,FRIAR YVES,"Her body was virginal, white, and straight,"
6657,FRIAR YVES,"And glowed like a dawning, golden, warm,"
6658,FRIAR YVES,Behind a robe of writhing green:
6659,FRIAR YVES,As when a rock's wall makes a screen
6660,FRIAR YVES,Whereon the crisscross reflect moves
6661,FRIAR YVES,Of circling water under the rays
6662,FRIAR YVES,Of April sunlight through the sprays
6663,FRIAR YVES,Of budding branches in willow groves--
6664,FRIAR YVES,A liquid mosaic of green and gold--
6665,FRIAR YVES,Thus was her robe.
6666,FRIAR YVES,
6667,FRIAR YVES,But to behold
6668,FRIAR YVES,Her face was to forget the youth
6669,FRIAR YVES,Of her white bosom. All her hair
6670,FRIAR YVES,Was tangled serpents; she did wear
6671,FRIAR YVES,A single eye in the middle brow.
6672,FRIAR YVES,"Her cheeks were shriveled, and one tooth"
6673,FRIAR YVES,Stuck from shrunken gums. A bough
6674,FRIAR YVES,O'ershadowed her the while she gripped
6675,FRIAR YVES,A pail in either hand. One dripped
6676,FRIAR YVES,"Clear water; one, ethereal fire."
6677,FRIAR YVES,Then to the Graia spoke the friar:
6678,FRIAR YVES,"""Have mercy! Tell me your desire"
6679,FRIAR YVES,"And what you are?"""
6680,FRIAR YVES,
6681,FRIAR YVES,Then the Graia said:
6682,FRIAR YVES,"""My body is Nature and my head"
6683,FRIAR YVES,"Is Man, and God has given me"
6684,FRIAR YVES,"A seeing spirit, strong and free,"
6685,FRIAR YVES,"Though by a single eye, as even"
6686,FRIAR YVES,Man has one vision at a time.
6687,FRIAR YVES,I lift my pails up; mark them well.
6688,FRIAR YVES,"With this fire I will burn up heaven,"
6689,FRIAR YVES,And with this water I will quench
6690,FRIAR YVES,"The flames of hell's remotest trench,"
6691,FRIAR YVES,That men may work in righteousness.
6692,FRIAR YVES,"Not for the fears of an after hell,"
6693,FRIAR YVES,Nor for the rewards which heaven will bless
6694,FRIAR YVES,The soul with when the mountains nod
6695,FRIAR YVES,"And the sun darkens, but for love"
6696,FRIAR YVES,"Of Man and Life, and love of God."
6697,FRIAR YVES,"Now look!"""
6698,FRIAR YVES,
6699,FRIAR YVES,She dashed the pail of fire
6700,FRIAR YVES,Against the vault of heaven. It fell
6701,FRIAR YVES,As would a canopy of blue
6702,FRIAR YVES,Burned by a soldier's careless torch.
6703,FRIAR YVES,"She dashed the water into hell,"
6704,FRIAR YVES,And a great steam rose up with the smell
6705,FRIAR YVES,"Of gaseous coals, which seemed to scorch"
6706,FRIAR YVES,All things which on the good earth grew.
6707,FRIAR YVES,"""Now,"" said the Graia, ""loiterer,"
6708,FRIAR YVES,"Awake from slumber, rise and speed"
6709,FRIAR YVES,To fight for the Holy Sepulcher--
6710,FRIAR YVES,"Nothing is left but Life, indeed--"
6711,FRIAR YVES,"I have burned heaven! I have quenched hell."""
6712,FRIAR YVES,
6713,FRIAR YVES,Friar Yves no longer slept;
6714,FRIAR YVES,Friar Yves awoke and wept.
6715,FRIAR YVES,
6716,FRIAR YVES,
6717,FRIAR YVES,
6718,FRIAR YVES,
6719,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE
6720,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6721,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6722,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"June, but we kept the fire place piled with logs,"
6723,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,And every day it rained. And every morning
6724,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,I heard the wind and rain among the leaves.
6725,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Try as I would my spirits grew no better.
6726,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,What was it? Was I ill or sick in mind?
6727,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"I spent the whole day working with my hands,"
6728,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,For there was brush to clear and corn to plant
6729,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Between the gusts of rain; and there at night
6730,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,I sat about the room and hugged the fire.
6731,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And the rain dripped and the wind blew, we shivered"
6732,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,For cold and it was June. I ached all through
6733,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"For my hard labor, why did muscles grow not"
6734,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"To hardness and cure body, if 'twere body,"
6735,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Or soul if it were soul?
6736,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6737,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,But there at night
6738,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"As I sat aching, worn, before the hour"
6739,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Of sleep, and restless in this interval"
6740,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Of nothingness, the silence out-of-doors,"
6741,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Timed by the dripping rain, and by the slap"
6742,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Of cards upon a table by a boarder
6743,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Who passed the time in playing solitaire,"
6744,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Sometimes my ancient host would fill his pipe,"
6745,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,And scrape away the dust of long past years
6746,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,To show me what had happened in his life.
6747,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,And as he smoked and talked his aged wife
6748,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Would parallel his theme, as a brooks' branches"
6749,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Formed by a slender island, flow together."
6750,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Or yet again she'd intercalate a touch,"
6751,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,An episode or version. And sometimes
6752,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,He'd make her hush; or sometimes he'd suspend
6753,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"While she went on to what she wished to finish,"
6754,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,When he'd resume. They talked together thus.
6755,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"He found the story and began to tell it,"
6756,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And she hung on his story, told it too."
6757,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6758,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"This night the rain came down in buckets full,"
6759,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,And Claude who brought the logs in showed his breath
6760,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Between the opening of the outer door
6761,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,And the swift on-rush of the room's warm air.
6762,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And my host who had hoed the whole day long,"
6763,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Hearty at eighty years, sat with his pipe"
6764,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Reading the organ of the Adventists,"
6765,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,His wife beside him knitting.
6766,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6767,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,On the table
6768,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Are several magazines with their monthly grist
6769,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Of stories and of pictures. O such stories!
6770,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Who writes these stories? How does it happen people
6771,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Are born into the world to read these stories?
6772,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"But anyway the lamp is very bad,"
6773,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,And every bone in me aches--and why always
6774,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Must one be either reading, knitting, talking?"
6775,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Why not sit quietly and think?
6776,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6777,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,At last
6778,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Between the clicking needles and the slap
6779,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Of cards upon the table and the swish
6780,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Of rain upon the window my host speaks:
6781,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""It says here when the Germans are defeated,"
6782,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And that means when the Turks are beaten too,"
6783,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"The Christian world will take back Palestine,"
6784,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And drive the Turks out. God be praised, I hope so."""
6785,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""Amen"" breaks in the wife. ""May we both live"
6786,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,To see the day. Perhaps you'll get your trunk back
6787,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"From Jaffa if the Allies win."""
6788,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6789,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,To me
6790,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"The wife turns and goes on, ""He has a trunk,"
6791,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"At least his trunk went on to Jaffa, and"
6792,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"It never came back. The bishop's trunk came back,"
6793,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"But his trunk never came."""
6794,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6795,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,And then the husband:
6796,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""What are you saying, mother, you go on"
6797,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,As if our friend here knew the story too.
6798,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,And then you talk as if our hope of the war
6799,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Was centered on recovering that trunk."""
6800,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6801,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""Oh, not at all"
6802,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"But if the Allies win, and the trunk is there"
6803,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,In Jaffa you might get it back. You know
6804,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,You'll never get it back while infidels
6805,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Rule Palestine."""
6806,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6807,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,The husband says to me:
6808,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""It looks as if she thought that trunk of mine,"
6809,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Which went to Jaffa fifty years ago,"
6810,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Is in existence yet, when chances are"
6811,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"They kept it for awhile, and sold it off,"
6812,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Or threw it away."""
6813,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6814,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""They never threw it away."
6815,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Why I made him a dozen shirts or more,"
6816,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And knitted him a lot of lovely socks,"
6817,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And made him neck-ties, and that trunk contained"
6818,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Everything that a man might need in absence
6819,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"A year from home. And yet they threw it away!"""
6820,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6821,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""They might have done so."""
6822,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6823,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""But they never did,"
6824,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Perhaps they threw your cabinet tools away?"""
6825,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""They were too valuable."""
6826,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6827,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""Too valuable,"
6828,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Fine socks and shirts are worthless are they, yes."""
6829,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6830,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""Not worthless, but fine tools are valuable."""
6831,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"He turns to me: ""I lost a box of tools"
6832,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Sent on to Jaffa, too. The scheme was this:"
6833,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,To work at cabinet making while observing
6834,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Conditions there in Palestine, and get ready"
6835,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"To drive the Turks from Palestine."""
6836,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6837,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,What's this?
6838,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,I rub my eyes and wake up to this story.
6839,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"I'm here in Illinois, in a farmer's house"
6840,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Who boards stray fishermen, and takes me in."
6841,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And in a moment Turks and Palestine,"
6842,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,And that old dream of Louis the Saint arise
6843,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And show me how the world is small, and a man"
6844,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Native to Illinois may travel forth
6845,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,And mix his life with ancient things afar.
6846,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,To-day be raising corn here and next month
6847,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Walking the streets of Jaffa, in Mycenæ,"
6848,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Digging for Grecian relics.
6849,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6850,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,So I asked
6851,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""Were you in Palestine?"" And the wife spoke quick:"
6852,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""He didn't get there, that's the joke of it."""
6853,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And the husband said: ""It wasn't such a joke."
6854,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"You see it was this way, myself and the bishop,"
6855,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"He lived in Springfield, I in Pleasant Plains,"
6856,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Had planned to meet in Switzerland."""
6857,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6858,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""Montreaux"""
6859,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,The wife broke in.
6860,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6861,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""Montreaux"" the husband added."
6862,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""You said you two had planned it,"" she went on."
6863,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Now looking over specks and speaking louder:
6864,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""The bishop came to him, he planned it out."
6865,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,My husband didn't plan the trip at all.
6866,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"He knows the bishop planned it."""
6867,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6868,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Then the husband:
6869,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""Oh for that matter he spoke of it first,"
6870,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,And I acceded and we worked it out.
6871,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"He was to go ahead of me, I was"
6872,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"To come in later, soon as I could raise"
6873,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,What funds my congregation could afford
6874,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"To spare for this adventure."""
6875,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6876,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""Guess,"" she said,"
6877,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""How much it was."""
6878,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6879,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,I shook my head and she
6880,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Said in a lowered and a tragic voice:
6881,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""Four hundred dollars, and you can believe"
6882,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,It strapped his church to raise so great a sum.
6883,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,And if they hadn't thought that Christ would come
6884,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Scarcely before the plan could be put through
6885,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Of winning back the Holy Land, that sum"
6886,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Had never been made up and put in gold
6887,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"For him to carry in a chamois belt."""
6888,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6889,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And then the husband said: ""Mother, be still,"
6890,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"I'll tell our friend the story if you'll let me."""
6891,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""I'm done,"" she said. ""I wanted to say that."
6892,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Go on,"" she said."
6893,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6894,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,And so he started over:
6895,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""The bishop came to me and said he thought"
6896,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,The Advent would be June of seventy-six.
6897,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,This was the winter of eighteen seventy-one.
6898,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,He said he had a dream; and in this dream
6899,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"An angel stood beside him, told him so,"
6900,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And told him to get me and go to Jaffa,"
6901,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And live there, learn the people and the country,"
6902,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,We were to live disguised the better to learn
6903,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,The people and the country. I was to work
6904,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"At my trade as a cabinet maker, he"
6905,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"At carpentry, which was his trade, and so"
6906,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"No one would know us, or suspect our plan."
6907,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And thus we could live undisturbed and work,"
6908,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And get all things in readiness, that in time"
6909,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"The Lord would send us power, and do all things."
6910,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,We were the messengers to go ahead
6911,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And make the ways straight, so I told her of it."""
6912,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6913,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""You told me, yes, but my trust was as great"
6914,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"As yours was in the bishop, little the good"
6915,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"To tell me of it."""
6916,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6917,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""Well, I told you of it."
6918,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And she said, 'If the Lord commands you so"
6919,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,You must obey.' And so she knit the socks
6920,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And made that trunk of things, as she has said,"
6921,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And in six weeks I sailed from Philadelphia."""
6922,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6923,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""'Twas nearer two months,"" said the wife."
6924,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6925,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""Perhaps,"
6926,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Somewhere between six weeks and that. The bishop
6927,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Left Springfield in a month from our first talk.
6928,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"I knew, for I went over when he left."
6929,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And I remember how his poor wife cried,"
6930,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,And how the children cried. He had a family
6931,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Of some eight children."""
6932,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6933,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""Only seven then,"
6934,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"The son named David died the year before."""
6935,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6936,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""Mother, you're right, 'twas seven children then."
6937,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"The oldest was not more than twelve, I think,"
6938,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And all the children cried, and at the train"
6939,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,His congregation almost to a man
6940,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Was there to see him off."""
6941,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6942,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""Well, one was missing."
6943,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"You know, you know,"" the wife said pregnantly."
6944,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6945,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""I'll come to that in time, if you'll be still."
6946,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Well, so the bishop left, and in six weeks,"
6947,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Or somewhere there, I started for Montreaux"
6948,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,To meet the bishop. Shipped ahead my trunk
6949,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,To Jaffa as the bishop did. But now
6950,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,I must tell you my dream. The night before
6951,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,I reached Montreaux I had a wondrous dream:
6952,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,I saw the bishop on the station platform
6953,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,His face with brandy blossoms splotched and wearing
6954,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,His gold head cane. And sure enough next day
6955,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,As I stepped from the train I saw the bishop
6956,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,His face with brandy blossoms splotched and wearing
6957,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"His gold head cane. And I thought something wrong,"
6958,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And still I didn't act upon the thought."""
6959,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6960,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""I should say not,"" the wife broke in again."
6961,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6962,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""Oh, well what could I do, if I had thought"
6963,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,More clearly than I did that things were wrong.
6964,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,You can't uproot the confidence of years
6965,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Because of dreams. And as to brandy blossoms
6966,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"I knew his face was red, but didn't know,"
6967,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Or think just then, that brandy made it red."
6968,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,And so I went up to the house he lived in--
6969,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"A mansion beautiful, and we sat down."
6970,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And he sat there bolt upright in a rocker,"
6971,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Hands spread upon his knees, his black eyes bigger"
6972,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Than I had ever seen them, eyeing me"
6973,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Silently for a moment, when he said:"
6974,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,'What money did you bring?' And so I told him.
6975,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,And he said quickly 'let me have it.' So
6976,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"I took my belt off, counted out the gold"
6977,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And gave it to him. And he took it, thrust it"
6978,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"With this hand in this pocket, that in that,"
6979,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And sat there and said nothing more, just looked!"
6980,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,And then before a word was spoke again
6981,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"I heard a step upon the stair, the stair"
6982,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Came down into this room where we were sitting.
6983,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And I looked up, and there--I rubbed my eyes--"
6984,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"I looked again, rose from my chair to see,"
6985,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And saw descending the most lovely woman,"
6986,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Who was""--"
6987,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6988,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""A lovely woman,"" sneered the wife"
6989,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""Well, she was just affinity to the bishop,"
6990,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"That's what she was."""
6991,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
6992,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""Affinity is right--"
6993,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"You see she was the leader in the choir,"
6994,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And she had run away with him, or rather"
6995,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Had gone abroad upon another boat
6996,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,And met him in Montreaux. Now from this time
6997,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,For forty hours or so all is a blank.
6998,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"I just remember trying to speak and choking,"
6999,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And flying from the room, the bishop clutching"
7000,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,At my coat sleeve to hold me. After that
7001,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,I can't recall a thing until I saw
7002,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,A little cottage way up in the Alps.
7003,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"I was knocking at the door, was faint and sick,"
7004,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"The door was opened and they took me in,"
7005,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And warmed me with a glass of wine, and tucked me"
7006,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,In a good bed where I slept half a week.
7007,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"It seems in my bewilderment I wandered,"
7008,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Ran, stumbled, climbed for forty hours or so"
7009,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"By rocky chasms, up the piney slopes."""
7010,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
7011,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""He might have lost his life,"" the wife exclaimed."
7012,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
7013,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""These were the kindest people in the world,"
7014,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"A French family. They gave me splendid food,"
7015,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,And when I left two francs to reach the place
7016,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Where lived the English Consul, who arranged"
7017,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,After some days for money for my passage
7018,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Back to America, and in six weeks"
7019,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"I preached a sermon here in Pleasant Plains."""
7020,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
7021,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""Beware of false prophets was the text!"" she said."
7022,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
7023,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,And I who heard this story through spoke up:
7024,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""The thing about this that I fail to get"
7025,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Concerns this woman, the affinity."
7026,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"If, as seems evident, she and the bishop"
7027,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Had planned this run-a-way and used the faith,"
7028,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And you, the congregation to get money"
7029,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"To do it with, or used you in particular"
7030,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,To get the money for themselves to live on
7031,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"After they had arrived there in Montreaux,"
7032,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"If all this be"" I said, ""why did this woman"
7033,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Descend just at the moment when he asked you
7034,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,For the money that you had. You might have seen her
7035,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Before you gave the money, if you had"
7036,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"You might have held it back."""
7037,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
7038,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""I would indeed,"
7039,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"You can be sure I should have held it back."""
7040,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
7041,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,And then the old wife gasped and dropped her knitting.
7042,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
7043,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""Now, James, you let me answer that, I know."
7044,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"She was done with the bishop, that's the reason."
7045,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Be still and let me answer. Here's the story:
7046,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,We found out later that the bishop's trunk
7047,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,And kit of tools had been returned from Jaffa
7048,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"There to Montreaux, were there that very day,"
7049,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Which means the bishop never meant to go
7050,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"To Palestine at all, but meant to meet"
7051,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,This woman in Montreaux and live with her.
7052,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Well, that takes money. So he used my husband"
7053,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,To get that money. Now you wonder I see
7054,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Why she would chance the spoiling of the scheme,"
7055,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Descend into the room before my husband
7056,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Had given up this money, and this money,"
7057,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"You see, was treated as a common fund"
7058,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Belonging to the church and to be used
7059,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"To get back Palestine, and so the bishop"
7060,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"As head of the church, superior to my husband,"
7061,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Could say 'give me the money'--that was natural,"
7062,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"My husband could not be surprised at that,"
7063,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Or question it. Well, why did she descend"
7064,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And almost lose the money? Oh, the cat!"
7065,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"I know what she did, as well as I had seen"
7066,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Her do it. Yes, she listened at the landing."
7067,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,And when she heard my husband tell the sum
7068,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Which he had brought, it wasn't enough to please her,"
7069,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"And Satan entered in her heart, and she"
7070,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Waited until she heard the bishop's pockets
7071,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Clink with the double eagles, then descended"
7072,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,To expose the bishop and disgrace him there
7073,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,And everywhere in all the world. Now listen:
7074,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,She got that money or the most of it
7075,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,In spite of what she did. For in six weeks
7076,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"After my husband had returned, she walked,"
7077,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"The brazen thing, the public streets of Springfield"
7078,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"As jaunty as you please, and pretty soon"
7079,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,The bishop died and all the papers printed
7080,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"The story of his shame."""
7081,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
7082,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,She had scarce finished
7083,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,When the man at solitaire threw down the deck
7084,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,And make a whacking noise and rose and came
7085,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Around in front of us and stood and looked
7086,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"The old man and old woman over, me"
7087,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,He studied too. Then in an organ voice:
7088,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""Is there a single verse in the New Testament"
7089,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"That hasn't sprouted one church anyway,"
7090,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,Letting alone the verses that have sprouted
7091,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Two, three or four or five? I know of one:"
7092,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Where is it that it says that ""Jesus wept""?"
7093,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Let's found a church on that verse, ""Jesus wept."""
7094,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,With that he went out in the rain and slammed
7095,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,The door behind him.
7096,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,
7097,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,The old clergyman
7098,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"Had fallen asleep. His wife looked up and said,"
7099,THE EIGHTH CRUSADE,"""That man is crazy, ain't he? I'm afraid."""

7111,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Who studies all religions, finds a wonder"
7112,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"In orphic spectacles like this, lays hold"
7113,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Upon my arm and draws me to a door
7114,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Through which we look and see a room of seats,"
7115,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"A platform at the end, a table on it,"

7119,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"We enter, take a seat."
7120,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,The band comes in and fills the room to bursting
7121,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"With horns and drums. They cease and feet are heard,"
7122,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"The crowd has followed, half the seats are full."
7123,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"After a prayer, a song, the captain mounts"
7124,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,The platform by the table and begins:
7125,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"""Praise God so many girls are here to-night,"

7127,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Saved from the wrath to come, will speak to you."""
7128,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"So Sister Trickey steps upon the platform,"
7129,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"A woman nearing forty, one would say."
7130,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Blue-eyed, fair skinned, and yellow haired, a figure"
7131,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Once trim enough, no doubt, grown stout at last."
7132,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"She was a pretty woman in her time,"
7133,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,'Twas plain to see. A shrewd intelligence

7142,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Had greater grace than mine. Praise God for Jesus!
7143,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Praise God for blood that washes sins away!
7144,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,I was a woman fallen till Lord Jesus

7146,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,My name is Lilah Trickey. Let me tell you
7147,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"How music was my tempter. Oh, you girls,"
7148,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,If there be one before me who can sing

7155,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,To tempt and use the bishop; in the bishop
7156,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Old Satan slipped to lure me from the path.
7157,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,He fell from grace for listening. And I
7158,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Whose voice had turned him over to the devil
7159,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Fell as he fell. He dragged me down with him.
7160,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"No use to make it long, one word's enough:"
7161,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Old Satan is the first word and the last,"
7162,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,And all between is nothing. It's enough
7163,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,To say the bishop and myself eloped
7164,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Went to Montreaux. He left a wife and children.
7165,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,And I poor silly thing with promises
7166,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Of culture of my voice in Paris, lost"
7167,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Good name and all. And he lost all as well.
7168,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Good name, his soul I fear, because he took"

7174,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"To let me go to Paris for my voice,"
7175,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,He never got enough to pay for that.
7176,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"On that point he betrayed me, now I see"
7177,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"'Twas God who used him to deceive me there,"

7192,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Seemed self-absorbed, depressed and never smiled."
7193,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,And every time his face came close to mine

7195,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Its venomed tail against his peace of mind.
7196,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,And so he took the brandy to benumb
7197,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,The sting of conscience and to dull the pain.
7198,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,He told me he had business in Montreaux

7200,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,By people who had money for him. I

7208,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,They entered. I was curious and sat
7209,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Upon the stair-way's landing just to hear.
7210,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,And this is what I heard. The bishop asked:

7212,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,
7213,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,The man replied 'four hundred dollars.' Then
7214,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,The bishop said: 'I'll take it.' In a moment
7215,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,I heard the clinking gold and heard the bishop
7216,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Putting it in his pocket.'

7222,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,And here was just a paltry sum. Scarce knowing
7223,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Just what I did, perhaps I wished to see"
7224,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"The American who brought the money--well,"
7225,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"No matter what it was, I walked in view"
7226,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Upon the landing, stood there for a moment"
7227,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"And saw our visitor, a clergyman"
7228,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"From all appearances. He stared, grew red,"
7229,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Large eyed and apoplectic, then he rose,"
7230,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Walked side-ways, backward, stumbled toward the door,"
7231,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Rattled with shaking hand the knob and jerked
7232,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"The door ajar, with open mouth backed out"
7233,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Upon the street and ran. I heard him run
7234,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"A square at least."""
7235,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,
7236,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"""The bishop looked at me,"
7237,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"His face all brandy blossoms, left the room,"
7238,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Came back at once with brandy on his breath.
7239,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"And all that day was tippling, went to bed"
7240,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,So drunk I had to take his clothing off
7241,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"And help him in."""
7242,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,
7243,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"""Young girls, beware of music,"
7244,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Save only hymns and sacred oratorios.
7245,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Beware the theatre and dancing hall.
7246,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Take lesson from my fate.
7247,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,
7248,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"""The morning came."
7249,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"The bishop called me, he was very ill"
7250,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,And pale with fear. He had a dream that night.
7251,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Satan had used him and abandoned him.
7252,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"And Death, whom only Jesus can put down,"
7253,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Was standing by the bed. He called to me,"
7254,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,And said to me:
7255,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,
7256,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"""'That money's in that drawer."
7257,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Use it to reach America, but use it"
7258,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,To send my body back. Death's in the corner
7259,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Behind that cabinet--there--see him look!
7260,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"I had a dream--go get a pen and paper,"
7261,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,And write down what I tell you. God forgive me--
7262,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Oh what a blasphemer am I. O, woman,"
7263,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,To lie here dying and to know that God
7264,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Has left me--hell awaits me--horrible!
7265,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Last night I dreamed this man who brought the money,"
7266,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"This man and I were walking from Damascus,"
7267,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,And in a trice came down to Olivet.
7268,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Just then great troops of men sprang up around us
7269,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,And hailed us as expecting our approach.
7270,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"And there I saw the faces--hundreds maybe,"
7271,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Of congregations who had trusted me
7272,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"In all the long past years--Oh, sinful woman,"
7273,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Why did you cross my path,' he moaned at times,"
7274,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,'And wreck my ministry.'
7275,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,
7276,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"""'And so these crowds"
7277,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Armed as it seemed, exulted, called me general,"
7278,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,And shouted forward. So we ran like mad
7279,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,And came before a building with a dome--
7280,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,You know--I've seen a picture of it somewhere.
7281,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,And so the crowds yelled: let the bishop enter
7282,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"And see the sepulchre, while we keep guard."
7283,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,They pushed me in. But when I was inside
7284,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"There was no dome, above us was the sky,"
7285,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,And what seemed walls was nothing but a fence.
7286,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Before us was a stable with a stall
7287,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Where two cows munched the hay. There was a farmer
7288,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Who with a pitchfork bedded down the stall.
7289,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"""Where is the holy sepulchre?"" I asked--"
7290,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"""My army's at the door."" He kept at work"
7291,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,And never raised his eyes and only said:
7292,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"""Don't know; I haven't time for things like that."
7293,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,You're 'bout the hundredth man who's asked me that.
7294,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"We don't know where it is, nor do we care."
7295,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"We live here and we knew him, so we feel"
7296,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Less interest than you. But have you thought
7297,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,If you should find it it would only be
7298,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,A tomb like other tombs? Why look at this:
7299,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Here is the very manger where he lay--
7300,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,What is it? Just a manger filled with straw.
7301,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,These cows are not the very cows you know--
7302,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,But cows are cows in every age and place.
7303,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,I think that board there has been nailed on since.
7304,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Outside of that the place is just the same.
7305,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Now what's the good of seeing it? His mother
7306,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Lay in that corner there, what if she did?"
7307,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,That lantern on the wall's the very one
7308,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,They came to see the child with from the inn--
7309,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"What of it? Take your army and go on,"
7310,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"And leave me with my barn and with my cows."""
7311,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,
7312,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"""'So all the glory vanished! Devil magic"
7313,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Stripped all the glory off. No angels singing,"
7314,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"No star of Bethlehem, no magi kneeling,"
7315,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"No Mary crowned, no Jesus King, no mystic"
7316,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Blood for sins' remission--just a barn,"
7317,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"A stall, two cows, a lantern--all the glory--"
7318,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Swept from the gospel. That's my punishment:
7319,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"My poor weak brain filled full of all this dream,"
7320,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Which seems as real as life--to lie here dying
7321,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Too weak to shake the dream! To see Death there
7322,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Behind that cabinet--there--see him look--
7323,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"By God forsaken--all theology,"
7324,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"All mystery, all wonder, all delight"
7325,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Of spiritual vision swept away as clean
7326,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"As winds sweep up the clouds, and thus to see"
7327,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"While dying, just a manger, and two cows,"
7328,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,A lantern on the wall.
7329,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,
7330,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"""'And thus to see,"
7331,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"For blasphemy that duped an honest heart,"
7332,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,And took the pitiful dollars of the flock
7333,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"To win you with--oh, woman, woman, woman,"
7334,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"A barn, a stall, a lantern limned so clear"
7335,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,In such a daylight of clear seeing senses
7336,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"That all the splendor, the miraculous"
7337,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Wonder of the virgin, nimbused child,"
7338,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,The star that followed till it rested over
7339,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"The manger (such a manger) all are wrecked,"
7340,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"All blotted from belief, all snatched away"
7341,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"From hands pushed off by God, no longer holding"

7343,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,
7344,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"""And so the bishop raved"
7345,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"While I stood terrified, since I could feel"
7346,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Death in the room, and almost see the monster"
7347,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Behind the cabinet.
7348,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,
7349,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"""Then the bishop said:"
7350,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"""'My dream went on. I crossed the stable yard"
7351,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,And passed into a place of tombs. And look!
7352,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Before I knew I stepped into a hole,"
7353,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"A sunken grave with just a slab at head,"
7354,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"And ""Jesus"" carven on it, nothing else,"
7355,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"No date, no birth, no parentage.'"""

7357,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"""'I lie"

7359,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Woman, take to your death bed with clear mind"
7360,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Of gospel faith, clean conscience, sins forgiven."
7361,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,The thoughts that we must suffer with and die with
7362,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Are worth the care of all the days of life.
7363,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"All life should be directed to this end,"
7364,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Lest when the mind lies fallen, vultures swoop,"
7365,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"And with their wings blot out the sun of faith,"
7366,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,And with their croakings drown the voice of God.'
7367,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,
7368,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"""He ceased, became delirious. So he died,"
7369,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,And I still unrepentant buried him
7370,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"There in Montreaux, and with what gold remained"
7371,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Went on to Paris.
7372,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,
7373,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"""See how I was marked"
7374,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,For God's salvation.
7375,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,
7376,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"""There I went to see"
7377,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"The celebrated teacher Jean Strakosch,"
7378,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Who looked at me with insolent, calm eyes,"
7379,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"And face impassive, let me sing a scale,"
7380,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Then shook his head. A diva, as I thought,"
7381,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Came in just then. They talked in French, and I,"
7382,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Prickling from head to foot with shame, ignored,"
7383,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Left standing like a fool, passed from the room."
7384,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"So music turned on me, but God received me,"
7385,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,And I came back to Springfield. But the Lord
7386,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,Made life too hard for me without the fold.
7387,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"I was so shunned and scorned, I had no place"
7388,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Save with the fallen, with the mockers, drinkers."
7389,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Thus being in conviction, after struggles,"
7390,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"And many prayers I found salvation, found"
7391,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,My work in life: which is to talk to girls
7392,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,And stand upon this platform and relate
7393,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"My story for their good."""
7394,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,
7395,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,She ceased. Amens
7396,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"Went up about the room. The big drum boomed,"
7397,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,"And the raucous brass horns mingled with the cymbals,"
7398,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,The silver triangle and the singing voices.
7399,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,
7400,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,My friend and I arose and left the room.
7401,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,
7402,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,
7403,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,
7404,THE BISHOP'S DREAM OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE,
7405,NEANDERTHAL,NEANDERTHAL
7406,NEANDERTHAL,
7407,NEANDERTHAL,
7408,NEANDERTHAL,"""Then what is life?"" I cried. And with that cry"
7409,NEANDERTHAL,I woke from deeper slumber--was it sleep?--
7410,NEANDERTHAL,And saw a hooded figure standing by
7411,NEANDERTHAL,The bed whereon I lay.
7412,NEANDERTHAL,
7413,NEANDERTHAL,"""Why do you keep,"
7414,NEANDERTHAL,"O spirit beautiful and swift, this guard"
7415,NEANDERTHAL,"About my slumber? Shelley, from the deep"
7416,NEANDERTHAL,"Why do you come with veiled face, mighty bard,"
7417,NEANDERTHAL,As that unearthly shape was veiled to you
7418,NEANDERTHAL,"At Casa Magni?"""
7419,NEANDERTHAL,
7420,NEANDERTHAL,Then the room was starred
7421,NEANDERTHAL,"With light as I was speaking, and I knew"
7422,NEANDERTHAL,"The god, my brother, from whose face the veil"
7423,NEANDERTHAL,Melted as mist.
7424,NEANDERTHAL,
7425,NEANDERTHAL,"""What mission fair and true,"
7426,NEANDERTHAL,"While I am sleeping, brings you? For I pale"
7427,NEANDERTHAL,"Amid this solemn stillness, for your face"
7428,NEANDERTHAL,"Unutterably majestic."""
7429,NEANDERTHAL,
7430,NEANDERTHAL,As when the dale
7431,NEANDERTHAL,"At midnight echoes for a little space,"
7432,NEANDERTHAL,"The night-bird's cry, the god responded ""Come,"""
7433,NEANDERTHAL,"And nothing more. I left my bed apace,"
7434,NEANDERTHAL,And followed him with wings above the gloom
7435,NEANDERTHAL,"Of clouds like chariots driven on to war,"
7436,NEANDERTHAL,Between whose wheels the swift moon raced and swum.
7437,NEANDERTHAL,
7438,NEANDERTHAL,"A mile beneath us lay the earth, afar"
7439,NEANDERTHAL,Were mountains which as swift as thought drew near
7440,NEANDERTHAL,"As we passed over pines, where many a star"
7441,NEANDERTHAL,And heaven's light made every frond as clear
7442,NEANDERTHAL,As through a glass or in the lightning's flash. ...
7443,NEANDERTHAL,"Yet I seemed flying from an olden fear,"
7444,NEANDERTHAL,A bulk of black that sought to sting or gnash
7445,NEANDERTHAL,"My breast or side--which was myself, it seemed,"
7446,NEANDERTHAL,The flesh or thinking part of me grown rash
7447,NEANDERTHAL,"And violent, a brain soul unredeemed,"
7448,NEANDERTHAL,Which sometime earlier in the grip of Death
7449,NEANDERTHAL,Forgot its terror when my soul which streamed
7450,NEANDERTHAL,"Like ribbons of silk fire, with quiet breath"
7451,NEANDERTHAL,"Said to the body, as it were a thing"
7452,NEANDERTHAL,"Separate and indifferent: ""How uneath"
7453,NEANDERTHAL,"That fellow turns, while I am safe yet cling"
7454,NEANDERTHAL,"Close to him, both another and the same."""
7455,NEANDERTHAL,Now was this mood reversed: That self must wing
7456,NEANDERTHAL,"Its fastest flight to fly him, lest he maim"
7457,NEANDERTHAL,"With fleshly hands my better, stronger part,"
7458,NEANDERTHAL,As dragon wings my flap and quench a flame. ...
7459,NEANDERTHAL,But as we passed o'er empires and athwart
7460,NEANDERTHAL,"A bellowing strait, beholding bergs and floes"
7461,NEANDERTHAL,And running tides which made the sinking heart
7462,NEANDERTHAL,"Rise up again for breath, I felt how close"
7463,NEANDERTHAL,"The god, my brother, was, who would sustain"
7464,NEANDERTHAL,"My wings whatever dangers might oppose,"
7465,NEANDERTHAL,"And knowing him beside me, like a strain"
7466,NEANDERTHAL,"Of music were his thoughts, though nothing yet"
7467,NEANDERTHAL,Was spoken by him.
7468,NEANDERTHAL,
7469,NEANDERTHAL,When as out of rain
7470,NEANDERTHAL,"Suddenly lights may break, the earth was set"
7471,NEANDERTHAL,"Beneath us, and we stood and paused to see"
7472,NEANDERTHAL,The Düssel river from a parapet
7473,NEANDERTHAL,"Of earth and rock. Then bending curiously,"
7474,NEANDERTHAL,"As reaching, in a moment with his hand"
7475,NEANDERTHAL,"He scraped the turf and stones, pried up a key"
7476,NEANDERTHAL,"Of harder granite, and at his command,"
7477,NEANDERTHAL,"When he had made an opening, I slid"
7478,NEANDERTHAL,"And sank, down, down through the Devonian land"
7479,NEANDERTHAL,Until with him I reached a cavern hid
7480,NEANDERTHAL,"From every eye but ours, and where no light"
7481,NEANDERTHAL,"But from our faces was, a pyramid"
7482,NEANDERTHAL,Of hills that walled this crypt of soundless night.
7483,NEANDERTHAL,"Then in a mood, it seemed more fanciful,"
7484,NEANDERTHAL,"He bent again and raked, and to my sight"
7485,NEANDERTHAL,Upheaved and held the remnant of a skull--
7486,NEANDERTHAL,"Gorilla's or a man's, I could not guess."
7487,NEANDERTHAL,"Yet brutal though it was, it was a hull"
7488,NEANDERTHAL,Too fine and large to house the nakedness
7489,NEANDERTHAL,Of a beast's mind.
7490,NEANDERTHAL,
7491,NEANDERTHAL,But as I looked the god
7492,NEANDERTHAL,"Began these words: ""Before the iron stress"
7493,NEANDERTHAL,"Of the north pole's dominion fell, he trod"
7494,NEANDERTHAL,"The wastes of Europe, ere the Nile was made"
7495,NEANDERTHAL,"A granary for the east, or ere the clod"
7496,NEANDERTHAL,In Babylon or India baked was laid
7497,NEANDERTHAL,"For hovels, this man lived. Ten thousand years"
7498,NEANDERTHAL,Before the earliest pyramid cast its shade
7499,NEANDERTHAL,"Upon the desolate sands this thing of fears,"
7500,NEANDERTHAL,"Lusts, hungers, lived and hunted, woke and slept,"
7501,NEANDERTHAL,"Mated, produced its kind, with hairy ears,"
7502,NEANDERTHAL,And tiger eyes sensed all that you accept
7503,NEANDERTHAL,In terms of thought or vision as the proof
7504,NEANDERTHAL,Of immanent Power or Love. But this skull kept
7505,NEANDERTHAL,The intangible meaning out. This heavy roof
7506,NEANDERTHAL,Of brutish bone above the eyes was dead
7507,NEANDERTHAL,"Even to lower ethers, no behoof"
7508,NEANDERTHAL,"Of seasons, stars or skies took, though they bred"
7509,NEANDERTHAL,"Suspicions, fears, or nervous glances, thought,"
7510,NEANDERTHAL,Which silent as a lizard's shadow fled
7511,NEANDERTHAL,"Before it graved itself, passed over, wrought"
7512,NEANDERTHAL,"No vision, only pain, which he deemed pangs"
7513,NEANDERTHAL,"Of hunger or of thirst."""
7514,NEANDERTHAL,
7515,NEANDERTHAL,As you have sought
7516,NEANDERTHAL,"The meaning of life's riddle, since it hangs"
7517,NEANDERTHAL,In waking or in slumber just above
7518,NEANDERTHAL,"The highest reach of prophecy, and fangs"
7519,NEANDERTHAL,"With poison of despair all moods but love,"
7520,NEANDERTHAL,Behold its secret lettered on this brow
7521,NEANDERTHAL,Placed by your own!
7522,NEANDERTHAL,
7523,NEANDERTHAL,This is the word thereof:
7524,NEANDERTHAL,"_Change and progression from the glazed slough,"
7525,NEANDERTHAL,"Where life creeps and is blind, ascending up"
7526,NEANDERTHAL,The jungled slopes for prey till spirits bow
7527,NEANDERTHAL,"On Calvaries with crosses, take the cup"
7528,NEANDERTHAL,Of martyrdom for truth's sake._
7529,NEANDERTHAL,
7530,NEANDERTHAL,It may be
7531,NEANDERTHAL,"Men of to-day make monstrous war, sleep, sup,"
7532,NEANDERTHAL,"Traffic, build shrines, as earliest history"
7533,NEANDERTHAL,"Records the earliest day, and that the race"
7534,NEANDERTHAL,"Is what it was in virtue, charity,"
7535,NEANDERTHAL,And nothing better. But within this face
7536,NEANDERTHAL,"No light shone from that realm where Hindostan,"
7537,NEANDERTHAL,"Delving in numbers, watching stars took grace"

7541,NEANDERTHAL,"Just where it was, but this change manifest"
7542,NEANDERTHAL,In fifty thousand years between the mind
7543,NEANDERTHAL,Neanderthal's and Shelley's.

7545,NEANDERTHAL,Man progressed
7546,NEANDERTHAL,"Along these years, found eyes where he was blind,"
7547,NEANDERTHAL,"Put instinct under thought, crawled from the cave,"
7548,NEANDERTHAL,"And faced the sun, till somewhere heaven's wind"
7549,NEANDERTHAL,"Mixed with the light of Lights descending, gave"
7550,NEANDERTHAL,"To mind a touch of divinity, making whole"
7551,NEANDERTHAL,An undeveloped growth.
7552,NEANDERTHAL,
7553,NEANDERTHAL,As ships that brave

7555,NEANDERTHAL,"From heaven catch, bear on, so man was wreathed"
7556,NEANDERTHAL,Somewhere with lightning and became a soul.
7557,NEANDERTHAL,Into his nostrils purer fire was breathed
7558,NEANDERTHAL,"Than breath of life itself, and by a leap,"
7559,NEANDERTHAL,"As lightning leaps from crag to crag, what seethed"
7560,NEANDERTHAL,In man from the beginning broke the sleep
7561,NEANDERTHAL,"That lay on consciousness of self, with eyes"
7562,NEANDERTHAL,"Awakened saw himself, out of the deep"
7563,NEANDERTHAL,And wonder of the self caught the surmise
7564,NEANDERTHAL,"Of Power beyond this world, and felt it through"
7565,NEANDERTHAL,The flow of living.
7566,NEANDERTHAL,
7567,NEANDERTHAL,And so man shall rise
7568,NEANDERTHAL,"From this illumination, from this clue"
7569,NEANDERTHAL,"To perfect knowledge that this Power exists,"
7570,NEANDERTHAL,"And what man is to this Power, even as you"
7571,NEANDERTHAL,Have left Neanderthal lost in the mists
7572,NEANDERTHAL,And ignorance of centuries untold.
7573,NEANDERTHAL,What would you say if learned geologists
7574,NEANDERTHAL,Out of the rocks and caverns should unfold
7575,NEANDERTHAL,"The skulls of greater races, records, books"

7577,NEANDERTHAL,Therein our retrogression? Wonder looks
7578,NEANDERTHAL,"In vain for these, discovers everywhere"
7579,NEANDERTHAL,Proof of the root which darkly bends and crooks
7580,NEANDERTHAL,Far down and far away; a stalk more fair
7581,NEANDERTHAL,"Upspringing finds its proof, buds on the stalk"

7588,NEANDERTHAL,"Not just itself, but make equivocal"
7589,NEANDERTHAL,"A Universal Reason, Vision? No."
7590,NEANDERTHAL,"You find no proof of this, but prodigal"
7591,NEANDERTHAL,Proof of ascending Life!
7592,NEANDERTHAL,
7593,NEANDERTHAL,So life shall flow
7594,NEANDERTHAL,Here on this globe until the final fruit
7595,NEANDERTHAL,And harvest. As it were until the glow
7596,NEANDERTHAL,Of the great blossom has the attribute
7597,NEANDERTHAL,"In essence, color of eternal things,"
7598,NEANDERTHAL,And shows no rim between its hues which suit
7599,NEANDERTHAL,The infinite sky's. Then if the dead earth swings
7600,NEANDERTHAL,A gleaned and stricken field amid the void
7601,NEANDERTHAL,"What matters it to you, a soul with wings,"
7602,NEANDERTHAL,Whether it be replanted or destroyed?

7608,NEANDERTHAL,"I heard again, ""Then what is life?"" And woke"
7609,NEANDERTHAL,To find the moonlight on the window sill
7610,NEANDERTHAL,"That which had seemed his presence. And a cloak,"
7611,NEANDERTHAL,"Whose hood was perked upon the moonbeams, made"
7612,NEANDERTHAL,The skull of the Neanderthal. The smoke
7613,NEANDERTHAL,Blown from the fireplace formed the cavern's shade.
7614,NEANDERTHAL,And roaring winds blew down as they had tuned

7907,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"In an April mood, a wonder light and free."
7908,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"The vision is gone, but gone the constant pain"
7909,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Of constant thought. I see dawn from my hill,"
7910,BOTANICAL GARDENS,And watch the lights which fingers from the waters
7911,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Twine from the sun or moon. Or look across
7912,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"The waste of bays and marshes to the woods,"
7913,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Under the prism colors of the air,"
7914,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Held in a vacuum silence, where the clouds,"
7915,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Like cyclop hoods are tossed against the sky
7916,BOTANICAL GARDENS,In terrible glory.
7917,BOTANICAL GARDENS,
7918,BOTANICAL GARDENS,And earth charmed I lie
7919,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Before the staring sphinx whose musing face
7920,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Is this Egyptian heaven, and whose eyes"
7921,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Are separate clouds of gold, whose pedestal"
7922,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Is earth, whose silken sheathed claws"
7923,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"No longer toy with me, even while I stroke them:"
7924,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Since I have ceased to tease her.
7925,BOTANICAL GARDENS,
7926,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Then behold
7927,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"A breeze is blown out of a world becalmed,"
7928,BOTANICAL GARDENS,And as I see the multitudinous leaves
7929,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Fluttered against the water and the light,"
7930,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"And see this light unveil itself, reveal"
7931,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"An inner light, a Presence, Secret splendor,"
7932,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"I clap hands over eyes, for the earth reels;"
7933,BOTANICAL GARDENS,And I have fears of dieties shown or spun
7934,BOTANICAL GARDENS,From nothingness. But when I look again
7935,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"The earth has stayed itself, I see the lake,"
7936,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"The leaves, the light of the sun, the cyclop hoods"
7937,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Of thunder heads, yet feel upon my arm"
7938,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"A hand I know, and hear a voice I know--"
7939,BOTANICAL GARDENS,He has returned and brought with him the thought
7940,BOTANICAL GARDENS,And the old pain.
7941,BOTANICAL GARDENS,
7942,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"The voice says: ""Leave the sphinx."
7943,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"The garden waits your study fully grown."""
7944,BOTANICAL GARDENS,And I arise and follow down a slope
7945,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"To a lawn by the lake and an ancient seat of stone,"
7946,BOTANICAL GARDENS,And near it a fountain's shattered rim enclosing
7947,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"An Eros of light mood, whose sculptured smile"
7948,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Consciously dimples for the unveiled pistil of love,"
7949,BOTANICAL GARDENS,As he strokes with baby hand the slender arching
7950,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Neck of a swan. And here is a peristyle
7951,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Whose carven columns are pink as the long updrawn
7952,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Stalks of tulips bedded in April snow.
7953,BOTANICAL GARDENS,And sunk amid tiger lillies is the face
7954,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Of an Asian Aphrodite close to the seat
7955,BOTANICAL GARDENS,With feet of a Babylonian lion amid
7956,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"This ruined garden of yellow daisies, poppies"
7957,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"And ruddy asphodel from Crete, it seems,"
7958,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Though here is our western moon as white and thin
7959,BOTANICAL GARDENS,As an abalone shell hung under the boughs
7960,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Of an oak, that is mocked by the vastness of sky between"
7961,BOTANICAL GARDENS,His boughs and the moon in this sky of afternoon. ...
7962,BOTANICAL GARDENS,We walk to the water's edge and here he shows me
7963,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Green scum, or stalks, or sedges, grasses, shrubs,"
7964,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"That yield to trees beyond the levels, where"
7965,BOTANICAL GARDENS,The beech and oak have triumph; for along
7966,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"This gradual growth from algae, reeds and grasses,"
7967,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"That builds the soil against the water's hands,"
7968,BOTANICAL GARDENS,All things are fierce for place and garner life
7969,BOTANICAL GARDENS,From weaker things.
7970,BOTANICAL GARDENS,
7971,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"And then he shows me root stocks,"
7972,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"And Alpine willow, growths that sneak and crawl"
7973,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Beneath the soil. Or as we leave the lake
7974,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"And walk the forest I behold lianas,"
7975,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Smilax or woodbine climbing round the trunks
7976,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Of giant trees that live and out of earth,"
7977,BOTANICAL GARDENS,And out of air make strength and food and ask
7978,BOTANICAL GARDENS,No other help. And in this place I see
7979,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Spiral bryony, python of the vines"
7980,BOTANICAL GARDENS,That coils and crushes; and that banyan tree
7981,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Whose spreading branches drop new roots to earth,"
7982,BOTANICAL GARDENS,And lives afar from where the parent trunk
7983,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Has sunk its roots, so that the healthful sun"
7984,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Is darkened: as a people might be darkened
7985,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"By ignorance or want or tyranny,"
7986,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Or dogma of a jungle hidden faith.
7987,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Why is it, think I, though I dare not speak,"
7988,BOTANICAL GARDENS,That this should be to forests or to men;
7989,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"That water fails, and light decreases, heat"
7990,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Of God's air lessens, and the soil goes spent,"
7991,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Till plants change leaves and stalks and seeds as well,"
7992,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Or migrate from the olden places, go"
7993,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"In search of life, or if they cannot move"
7994,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Die in the ruthless marches.
7995,BOTANICAL GARDENS,
7996,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"That is life, he said."
7997,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"For even these, the giants scatter life"
7998,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Into the maws of death. That towering tree
7999,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"That for these hundred years has leafed itself,"
8000,BOTANICAL GARDENS,And through its leaves out of the magic air
8001,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Drawn nutriment for annual girths, took root"
8002,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Out of an acorn which good chance preserved,"
8003,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"While all its brother acorns cast to earth,"
8004,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"To make trees, by a parent tree now gone,"
8005,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Were crushed, devoured, or strangled as they sprouted"
8006,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Amid thick jealous growth wherein they fell.
8007,BOTANICAL GARDENS,All acorns but this one were lost.
8008,BOTANICAL GARDENS,
8009,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Then he reads
8010,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"My questioning thought and shows me yuccas, cactus"
8011,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Whose thick leaves in the rainless places thrive.
8012,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"And shows me leaves that must have rain, and roots"
8013,BOTANICAL GARDENS,That must have water where the river flows.
8014,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"And how the spirit of life, though turned or driven"
8015,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"This way or that beyond a course begun,"
8016,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Cannot be stayed or quenched, but moves, conforms"
8017,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"To soil and sun, makes roots, or thickens leaves,"
8018,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Or thins or re-adjusts them on the stem
8019,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"To fashion forth itself, produce its kind."
8020,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Nor dies not, rests not, nor surrenders not,"
8021,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Is only changed or buried, re-appears"
8022,BOTANICAL GARDENS,As other forms of life.
8023,BOTANICAL GARDENS,
8024,BOTANICAL GARDENS,We had walked through
8025,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"A forest of sequoias, beeches, pines,"
8026,BOTANICAL GARDENS,And ancient oaks where I could see the trace
8027,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Of willows, alders, ruined or devoured"
8028,BOTANICAL GARDENS,By the great Titans.
8029,BOTANICAL GARDENS,
8030,BOTANICAL GARDENS,At last
8031,BOTANICAL GARDENS,We reached my hill and sat and overlooked
8032,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"The garden at our feet, even to the place"
8033,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Of tiger lilies and of asphodel,"
8034,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"By now beneath the self-same moon, grown denser:"
8035,BOTANICAL GARDENS,As where the wounded surface of the shell
8036,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Thickens its shimmering stuff in spiral coigns
8037,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Of the shell, so was the moon above the seat"
8038,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Beside the Eros and the Aphrodite
8039,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Sunk amid yellow daisies and deep grass.
8040,BOTANICAL GARDENS,And here we sat and looked. And here my vision
8041,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Was over all we saw, but not a part"
8042,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Of what we saw, for all we saw stood forth"
8043,BOTANICAL GARDENS,As foreign to myself as something touched
8044,BOTANICAL GARDENS,To learn the thing it is.
8045,BOTANICAL GARDENS,
8046,BOTANICAL GARDENS,I might have asked
8047,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Who owns this garden, for the thought arose"
8048,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"With my surprise, who owns this garden, who"
8049,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Planted this garden, why and to what end,"
8050,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"And why this fight for place, for soil and sun"
8051,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Water and air, and why this enmity"
8052,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Between the things here planted, and between"
8053,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Flying or crawling life and plants, and whence"
8054,BOTANICAL GARDENS,The power that falls in one place but arises
8055,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Some other place; and why the unceasing growth
8056,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Of all these forms that only come to seed,"
8057,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Then disappear to enrich the insatiate soil
8058,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Where the new seed falls? But silence kept me there
8059,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"For wonder of the beauty which I saw,"
8060,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Even while the faculty of external vision
8061,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Kept clear the garden separate from me,"
8062,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Envisioned, seen as grasses, sedges, alders,"
8063,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"As forestry, as fields of wheat and corn,"
8064,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"As the vast theatre of unceasing life,"
8065,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Moving to life and blind to all but life;
8066,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"As places used, tried out, as if the gardener,"
8067,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"For his delight or use, or for an end"
8068,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Of good or beauty made experiments
8069,BOTANICAL GARDENS,With seed or soils or crossings of the seed.
8070,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Even as peoples, epochs, did the garden"
8071,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Lie to my vision, or as races crowding,"
8072,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Absorbing, dispossessing, killing races,"
8073,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Not only for a place to grow, but under"
8074,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"A stimulus of doctrine: as Mahomet,"
8075,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Or Jesus, like a vital change of air,"
8076,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Or artifice of culture, made the garden,"
8077,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Which mortals call the world, grow in a way,"
8078,BOTANICAL GARDENS,And overgrow the world as neither dreamed.
8079,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Who is the Gardener then? Or is there one
8080,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Beside the life within the plant, within"
8081,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"The python climbers, wandering sedges, root stalks,"
8082,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Thorn bushes, night-shade, deadly saprophytes,"
8083,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Goths, Vandals, Tartars, striving for more life,"
8084,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"And praying to the urge within as God,"
8085,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"The Gardener who lays out the garden, sprays"
8086,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"For insects which devour, keeps rich the soil"
8087,BOTANICAL GARDENS,For those who pray and know the Gardener
8088,BOTANICAL GARDENS,As One who is without and over-sees? ...
8089,BOTANICAL GARDENS,
8090,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"But while in contemplation of the garden,"
8091,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Whether from failing day or from departure
8092,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Of my own vision in the things it saw,"
8093,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Bereft of penetrating thought I sank,"
8094,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Became a part of what I saw and lost
8095,BOTANICAL GARDENS,The great solution.
8096,BOTANICAL GARDENS,
8097,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"As we sat in silence,"
8098,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"And coming night, what seemed the sinking moon,"
8099,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Amid the yellow sedges by the lake
8100,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Began to twinkle, as a fire were blown--"
8101,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"And it was fire, the garden was afire,"
8102,BOTANICAL GARDENS,As it were all the world had flamed with war.
8103,BOTANICAL GARDENS,And a wind came out of the bright heaven
8104,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"And blew the flames, first through the ruined garden,"
8105,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Then through the wood, the fields of wheat, at last"
8106,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Nothing was left but waste and wreaths of smoke
8107,BOTANICAL GARDENS,Twisting toward the stars. And there he sat
8108,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Nor uttered aught, save when I sighed he said"
8109,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"""If it be comforting I promise you"
8110,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"Another spring shall come."""
8111,BOTANICAL GARDENS,
8112,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"""And after that?"""
8113,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"""Another spring--that's all I know myself,"
8114,BOTANICAL GARDENS,"There shall be springs and springs!"""
8115,BOTANICAL GARDENS,
