477,AT NIGHT,Hither the soft wings sweep;
478,AT NIGHT,Flocks of the memories of the day draw near
479,AT NIGHT,The dovecote doors of sleep.
480,AT NIGHT,
481,AT NIGHT,O which are they that come through sweetest light
482,AT NIGHT,Of all these homing birds?
483,AT NIGHT,Which with the straightest and the swiftest flight?
484,AT NIGHT,"Your words to me, your words!"
485,AT NIGHT,
486,AT NIGHT,
487,AT NIGHT,
488,AT NIGHT,
489,AT NIGHT,
