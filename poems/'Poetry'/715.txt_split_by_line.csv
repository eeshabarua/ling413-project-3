58,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH
59,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,
60,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Around my feet the clouds are drawn
61,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,In the cold mystery of the dawn;
62,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"No breezes cheer, no guests intrude"
63,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"My mossy, mist-clad solitude;"
64,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,When sudden down the steeps of sky
65,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Flames a long, lightening wind.  On high"
66,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"The steel-blue arch shines clear, and far,"
67,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"In the low lands where cattle are,"
68,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Towns smoke.  And swift, a haze, a gleam,--"
69,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"The Firth lies like a frozen stream,"
70,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Reddening with morn.  Tall spires of ships,"
71,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Like thorns about the harbour's lips,"
72,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Now shake faint canvas, now, asleep,"
73,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Their salt, uneasy slumbers keep;"
74,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"While golden-grey, o'er kirk and wall,"
75,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Day wakes in the ancient capital.
76,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,
77,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Before me lie the lists of strife,"
78,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"The caravanserai of life,"
79,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Whence from the gates the merchants go
80,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,On the world's highways; to and fro
81,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Sail laiden ships; and in the street
82,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"The lone foot-traveller shakes his feet,"
83,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,And in some corner by the fire
84,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Tells the old tale of heart's desire.
85,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Thither from alien seas and skies
86,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Comes the far-questioned merchandise:--
87,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Wrought silks of Broussa, Mocha's ware"
88,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Brown-tinted, fragrant, and the rare"
89,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Thin perfumes that the rose's breath
90,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Has sought, immortal in her death:"
91,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Gold, gems, and spice, and haply still"
92,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,The red rough largess of the hill
93,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Which takes the sun and bears the vines
94,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Among the haunted Apennines.
95,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,And he who treads the cobbled street
96,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"To-day in the cold North may meet,"
97,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Come month, come year, the dusky East,"
98,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,And share the Caliph's secret feast;
99,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Or in the toil of wind and sun
100,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Bear pilgrim-staff, forlorn, fordone,"
101,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Till o'er the steppe, athwart the sand"
102,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Gleam the far gates of Samarkand.
103,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"The ringing quay, the weathered face"
104,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Fair skies, dusk hands, the ocean race"
105,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"The palm-girt isle, the frosty shore,"
106,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Gales and hot suns the wide world o'er
107,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Grey North, red South, and burnished West"
108,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"The goals of the old tireless quest,"
109,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Leap in the smoke, immortal, free,"
110,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Where shines yon morning fringe of sea
111,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"I turn, and lo! the moorlands high"
112,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Lie still and frigid to the sky.
113,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,The film of morn is silver-grey
114,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"On the young heather, and away,"
115,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Dim, distant, set in ribs of hill,"
116,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Green glens are shining, stream and mill,"
117,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Clachan and kirk and garden-ground,"
118,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,All silent in the hush profound
119,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Which haunts alone the hills' recess,"
120,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,The antique home of quietness.
121,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Nor to the folk can piper play
122,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"The tune of ""Hills and Far Away,"""
123,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,For they are with them.  Morn can fire
124,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"No peaks of weary heart's desire,"
125,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Nor the red sunset flame behind
126,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Some ancient ridge of longing mind.
127,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"For Arcady is here, around,"
128,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"In lilt of stream, in the clear sound"
129,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Of lark and moorbird, in the bold"
130,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Gay glamour of the evening gold,"
131,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,And so the wheel of seasons moves
132,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"To kirk and market, to mild loves"
133,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"And modest hates, and still the sight"
134,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Of brown kind faces, and when night"
135,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Draws dark around with age and fear
136,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Theirs is the simple hope to cheer.--
137,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,A land of peace where lost romance
138,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,And ghostly shine of helm and lance
139,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Still dwell by castled scarp and lea,"
140,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"And the last homes of chivalry,"
141,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"And the good fairy folk, my dear,"
142,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Who speak for cunning souls to hear,"
143,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,In crook of glen and bower of hill
144,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Sing of the Happy Ages still.
145,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,
146,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,
147,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"O Thou to whom man's heart is known,"
148,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Grant me my morning orison.
149,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Grant me the rover's path--to see
150,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"The dawn arise, the daylight flee,"
151,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,In the far wastes of sand and sun!
152,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Grant me with venturous heart to run
153,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"On the old highway, where in pain"
154,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"And ecstasy man strives amain,"
155,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Conquers his fellows, or, too weak,"
156,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Finds the great rest that wanderers seek!
157,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"Grant me the joy of wind and brine,"
158,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"The zest of food, the taste of wine,"
159,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"The fighter's strength, the echoing strife"
160,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,The high tumultuous lists of life--
161,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"May I ne'er lag, nor hapless fall,"
162,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Nor weary at the battle-call!...
163,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"But when the even brings surcease,"
164,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Grant me the happy moorland peace;
165,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,That in my heart's depth ever lie
166,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"That ancient land of heath and sky,"
167,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Where the old rhymes and stories fall
168,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"In kindly, soothing pastoral."
169,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"There in the hills grave silence lies,"
170,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,And Death himself wears friendly guise
171,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,"There be my lot, my twilight stage,"
172,FROM THE PENTLANDS LOOKING NORTH AND SOUTH,Dear city of my pilgrimage.

183,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE
184,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
185,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
186,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,...I came down from the mountain and into the pleasing valley of the
187,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,Adige in as pelting a heat as ever mortal suffered under.  The way
188,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,underfoot was parched and white; I had newly come out of a wilderness
189,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"of white limestone crags, and a sun of Italy blazed blindingly in an"
190,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"azure Italian sky.  You are to suppose, my dear aunt, that I had had"
191,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,enough and something more of my craze for foot-marching.  A fortnight
192,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"ago I had gone to Belluno in a post-chaise, dismissed my fellow to"
193,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"carry my baggage by way of Verona, and with  no more than a valise on"
194,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,my back plunged into the fastnesses of those mountains.  I had a fancy
195,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,to see the little sculptured hills which made backgrounds for
196,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"Gianbellini, and there were rumours of great mountains built wholly of"
197,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,marble which shone like the battlements.
198,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
199,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,...1 This extract from the unpublished papers of the Manorwater family
200,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,has seemed to the Editor worth printing for its historical interest.
201,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,The famous Lady Molly Carteron became Countess of Manorwater by her
202,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"second marriage.  She was a wit and a friend of wits, and her nephew,"
203,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,the Honourable Charles Hervey-Townshend (afterwards our Ambassador at
204,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"The Hague), addressed to her a series of amusing letters while making,"
205,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"after the fashion of his contemporaries, the Grand Tour of Europe."
206,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"Three letters, written at various places in the Eastern Alps and"
207,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"despatched from Venice, contain the following short narrative...."
208,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
209,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"of the Celestial City.  So at any rate reported young Mr. Wyndham, who"
210,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,had travelled with me from Milan to Venice.  I lay the first night at
211,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"Pieve, where Titian had the fortune to be born, and the landlord at the"
212,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,inn displayed a set of villainous daubs which he swore were the early
213,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,works of that master.  Thence up a toilsome valley I journeyed to the
214,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"Ampezzan country, valley where indeed I saw my white mountains, but,"
215,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,alas!  no longer Celestial.  For it rained like Westmorland for five
216,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"endless days, while I kicked my heels in an inn and turned a canto of"
217,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"Aristo into halting English couplets.  By-and-by it cleared, and I"
218,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"headed westward towards Bozen, among the tangle of rocks where the"
219,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,Dwarf King had once his rose-garden.  The first night I had no inn but
220,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"slept in the vile cabin of a forester, who spoke a tongue half Latin,"
221,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"half Dutch, which I failed to master.  The next day was a blaze of"
222,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"heat, the mountain-paths lay thick with dust, and I had no wine from"
223,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"sunrise to sunset.  Can you wonder that, when the following noon I saw"
224,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"Santa Chiara sleeping in its green circlet of meadows, my thought was"
225,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,only of a deep draught and a cool chamber?  I protest that I am a great
226,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"lover of natural beauty, of rock and cascade, and all the properties of"
227,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,the poet: but the enthusiasm of Rousseau himself would sink from the
228,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,stars to earth if he had marched since breakfast in a cloud of dust
229,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,with a throat like the nether millstone.
230,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
231,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,Yet I had not entered the place before Romance revived.  The little
232,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,town--a mere wayside halting-place on the great mountain-road to the
233,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,North--had the air of mystery which foretells adventure.  Why is it
234,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,that a dwelling or a countenance catches the fancy with the promise of
235,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,some strange destiny?  I have houses in my mind which I know will some
236,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,day and somehow be intertwined oddly with my life; and I have faces in
237,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,memory of which I know nothing--save that I shall undoubtedly cast eyes
238,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,again upon them. My first glimpses of Santa Chiara gave me this earnest
239,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"of romance.  It was walled and fortified, the streets were narrow pits"
240,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"of shade, old tenements with bent fronts swayed to meet each other."
241,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"Melons lay drying on flat roofs, and yet now and then would come a"
242,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,high-pitched northern gable.  Latin and Teuton met and mingled in the
243,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"place, and, as Mr. Gibbon has taught us, the offspring of this"
244,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,admixture is something fantastic and unpredictable.  I forgot my
245,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,grievous thirst and my tired feet in admiration and a certain vague
246,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"expectation of wonders.  Here, ran my thought, it is fated, maybe, that"
247,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,romance and I shall at last compass a meeting.  Perchance some princess
248,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"is in need of my arm, or some affair of high policy is afoot in this"
249,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"jumble of old masonry.  You will laugh at my  folly, but I had an"
250,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,excuse for it.  A fortnight in strange mountains disposes a man to look
251,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"for something at his next encounter with his kind, and the sight of"
252,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,Santa Chiara would have fired the imagination of a judge in Chancery.
253,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
254,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"I strode happily into the courtyard of the Tre Croci, and presently had"
255,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"my expectation confirmed for I found my fellow,--a faithful rogue I got"
256,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"in Rome on a Cardinal's recommendation,--hot in dispute with a lady's"
257,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"maid. The woman was old, harsh-featured--no Italian clearly, though she"
258,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"spoke fluently in the tongue.  She rated my man like a pickpocket, and"
259,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,the dispute was over a room.
260,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
261,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"""The signor will bear me out,"" said Gianbattista.  ""Was not I sent to"
262,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"Verona with his baggage, and thence to this place of ill manners?  Was"
263,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,I not bidden engage for him a suite of apartments?  Did I not duly
264,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"choose these fronting on the gallery, and dispose therein the signor's"
265,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,baggage?  And lo! an hour ago I found it all turned into the yard and
266,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"this woman installed in its place.  It is monstrous, unbearable!  Is"
267,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"this an inn for travellers, or haply the private mansion of these"
268,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"Magnificences?"""
269,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
270,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"""My servant speaks truly,"" I said firmly yet with courtesy, having no"
271,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"mind to spoil adventure by urging rights.  ""He had orders to take these"
272,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"rooms for me, and I know not what higher power can countermand me."""
273,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
274,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"The woman had been staring at me scornfully, for no doubt in my dusty"
275,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,habit I was a figure of small count; but at the sound of my voice she
276,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"started, and cried out, ""You are English, signor?"""
277,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
278,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"I bowed an admission.  ""Then my mistress shall speak with you,"" she"
279,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"said, and dived into the inn like an elderly rabbit."
280,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
281,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,Gianbattista was for sending for the landlord and making a riot in that
282,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"hostelry; but I stayed him, and bidding him fetch me a flask of white"
283,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"wine, three lemons, and a glass of eau de vie, I sat down peaceably at"
284,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,one of the little tables in the courtyard and prepared for the
285,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"quenching of my thirst.  Presently, as I sat drinking that excellent"
286,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"compound of my own invention, my shoulder was touched, and I turned to"
287,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"find the maid and her mistress.  Alas for my hopes of a glorious being,"
288,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,young and lissom and bright with the warm riches of the south!  I saw a
289,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"short, stout little lady, well on the wrong side of thirty. She had"
290,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"plump red cheeks, and fair hair dressed indifferently in the Roman"
291,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"fashion.  Two candid blue eyes redeemed her plainness, and a certain"
292,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"grave and gentle dignity.  She was notably a gentlewoman, so I got up,"
293,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"doffed my hat, and awaited her commands."
294,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
295,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"She spoke in Italian.  ""Your pardon, signor, but I fear my good"
296,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"Cristine has done you unwittingly a wrong."""
297,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
298,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"Cristine snorted at this premature plea of guilty, while I hastened to"
299,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,assure the fair apologist that any rooms I might have taken were freely
300,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,at her service.
301,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
302,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"I spoke unconsciously in English, and she replied in a halting parody"
303,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"of that tongue.  ""I understand him,"" she said, ""but I do not speak him"
304,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"happily. I will discourse, if the signor pleases, in our first speech."""
305,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
306,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"She and her father, it appeared, had come over the Brenner, and arrived"
307,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"that morning at the Tre Croci, where they purposed to lie for some"
308,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"days.  He was an old man, very feeble, and much depending upon her"
309,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,constant care.  Wherefore it was necessary that the rooms of all the
310,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"party should adjoin, and there was no suite of the size in the inn save"
311,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"that which I had taken.  Would I therefore consent to forgo my right,"
312,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,and place her under an eternal debt?
313,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
314,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"I agreed most readily, being at all times careless where I sleep, so"
315,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"the bed be clean, or where I eat, so the meal be good.  I bade my"
316,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,servant see the landlord and have my belongings carried to other rooms.
317,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"Madame thanked me sweetly, and would have gone, when a thought detained"
318,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,her.
319,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
320,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"""It is but courteous,"" she said, ""that you should know the names of"
321,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,those whom you have befriended.  My father is called the Count
322,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"d'Albani, and I am his only daughter.  We travel to Florence, where we"
323,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"have a villa in the environs."""
324,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
325,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"""My name,"" said I, ""is Hervey-Townshend, an Englishman travelling"
326,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"abroad for his entertainment."""
327,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
328,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"""Hervey?"" she repeated.  ""Are you one of the family of Miladi Hervey?"""
329,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
330,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"""My worthy aunt,"" I replied, with a tender recollection of that"
331,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,preposterous woman.
332,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
333,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"Madame turned to Cristine, and spoke rapidly in a whisper."
334,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
335,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"""My father, sir,"" she said, addressing me, ""is an old frail man, little"
336,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,used to the company of strangers; but in former days he has had
337,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"kindness from members of your house, and it would be a satisfaction to"
338,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"him, I think, to have the privilege of your acquaintance."""
339,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
340,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,She spoke with the air of a vizier who promises a traveller a sight of
341,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"the Grand Turk.  I murmured my gratitude, and hastened after"
342,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"Gianbattista.  In an hour I had bathed, rid myself of my beard, and"
343,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,arrayed myself in decent clothing.  Then I strolled out to inspect the
344,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"little city, admired an altar-piece, chaffered with a Jew for a cameo,"
345,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"purchased some small necessaries, and returned early in the afternoon"
346,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,with a noble appetite for dinner.
347,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
348,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"The Tre Croci had been in happier days a Bishop's lodging, and"
349,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,possessed a dining-hall ceiled with black oak and adorned with frescos.
350,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"It was used as a general salle a manger for all dwellers in the inn,"
351,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,and there accordingly I sat down to my long-deferred meal.  At first
352,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"there were no other diners, and I had two maids, as well as"
353,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"Gianbattista, to attend on my wants.  Presently Madame d'Albani"
354,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"entered, escorted by Cristine and by a tall gaunt serving-man, who"
355,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"seemed no part of the hostelry.  The landlord followed, bowing civilly,"
356,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,and the two women seated themselves at the little table at the farther
357,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"end.  ""Il Signor Conte dines in his room,"" said Madame to the host, who"
358,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,withdrew to see to that gentleman's needs.
359,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
360,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,I found my eyes straying often to the little party in the cool twilight
361,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"of that refectory.  The man-servant was so old and battered, and of"
362,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"such a dignity, that he lent a touch of intrigue to the thing. He stood"
363,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"stiffly behind Madame's chair, handing dishes with an air of great"
364,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"reverence--the lackey of a great noble, if I had ever seen the type."
365,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"Madame never glanced toward me, but conversed sparingly with Cristine,"
366,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,while she pecked delicately at her food.  Her name ran in my head with
367,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,a tantalizing flavour of the familiar.  Albani!  D'Albani!  It was a
368,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"name not uncommon in the Roman States, but I had never heard it linked"
369,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"to a noble family. And yet I had somehow, somewhere; and in the vain"
370,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,effort at recollection I had almost forgotten my hunger.  There was
371,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"nothing bourgeois in the little lady.  The austere servants, the high"
372,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"manner of condescension, spake of a stock used to deference, though,"
373,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"maybe, pitifully decayed in its fortunes.  There was a mystery in"
374,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,these quiet folk which tickled my curiosity.  Romance after all was not
375,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,destined to fail me at Santa Chiara.
376,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
377,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,My doings of the afternoon were of interest to me alone.  Suffice it to
378,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,say that when at nightfall I found Gianbattista the trustee of a
379,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"letter.  It was from Madame, written in a fine thin hand on a delicate"
380,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"paper, and it invited me to wait upon the signor her father, that"
381,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,evening at eight o'clock.  What caught my eye was a coronet stamped in
382,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"a corner.  A coronet, I say, but in truth it was a crown, the same as"
383,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,surmounts the Arms Royal of England on the sign-board of a Court
384,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,tradesman.  I marvelled at the ways of foreign heraldry.  Either this
385,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,family of d'Albani had higher pretensions than I had given it credit
386,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"for, or it employed an unlearned and imaginative stationer.  I"
387,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,scribbled a line of acceptance and went to dress.
388,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
389,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,The hour of eight found me knocking at the Count's door.  The grim
390,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,serving-man admitted me to the pleasant chamber which should have been
391,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"mine own.  A dozen wax candles burned  in sconces, and on the table"
392,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,among fruits and the remains of supper stood a handsome candelabra of
393,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"silver.  A small fire of logs had been lit on the hearth, and before it"
394,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,in an armchair sat a strange figure of a man.  He seemed not so much
395,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"old as aged.  I should have put him at sixty, but the marks he bore"
396,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,were clearly less those of time than of life.  There sprawled before me
397,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"the relics of noble looks.  The fleshy nose, the pendulous cheek, the"
398,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"drooping mouth, had once been cast in looks of manly beauty.  Heavy"
399,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,eyebrows above and heavy bags beneath spoiled the effect of a choleric
400,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"blue eye, which age had not dimmed.  The man was gross and yet haggard;"
401,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"it was not the padding of good living which clothed his bones, but a"
402,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,heaviness as of some dropsical malady.  I could picture him in health a
403,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"gaunt loose-limbed being, high-featured and swift and eager.  He was"
404,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"dressed wholly in black velvet, with fresh ruffles and wristbands, and"
405,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,he wore heeled shoes with antique silver buckles.  It was a figure of
406,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"an older age which rose to greet me, in one hand a snuff-box and a"
407,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"purple handkerchief, and in the other a book with finger marking place."
408,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"He made me a great bow as Madame uttered my name, and held out a hand"
409,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,with a kindly smile.
410,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
411,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"""Mr. Hervey-Townshend,"" he said, ""we will speak English, if you please."
412,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"I am fain to hear it again, for 'tis a tongue I love.  I make you"
413,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"welcome, sir, for your own sake and for the sake of your kin.  How is"
414,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"her honourable ladyship, your aunt?   A week ago she sent me a letter."""
415,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
416,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"I answered that she did famously, and wondered what cause of"
417,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,correspondence my worthy aunt could have with wandering nobles of Italy.
418,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
419,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"He motioned me to a chair between Madame and himself, while a servant"
420,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,set a candle on a shelf behind him.  Then he proceeded to catechise me
421,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"in excellent English, with now and then a phrase of French, as to the"
422,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,doings in my own land.  Admirably informed this Italian gentleman
423,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,proved himself.  I defy you to find in Almack's more intelligent
424,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,gossip.  He inquired as to the chances of my Lord North and the mind of
425,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,my Lord Rockingham.  He had my Lord Shelburne's foibles at his fingers'
426,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"ends.  The habits of the Prince, the aims of the their ladyships of"
427,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"Dorset and Buckingham, the extravagance of this noble Duke and that"
428,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,right honourable gentleman were not hid from him.  I answered
429,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"discreetly yet frankly, for there was no ill-breeding in his curiosity."
430,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"Rather it seemed like the inquiries of some fine lady, now buried deep"
431,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"in the country, as to the doings of a forsaken Mayfair.  There was"
432,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,humour in it and something of pathos.
433,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
434,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"""My aunt must be a voluminous correspondent, sir,"" I said."
435,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
436,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"He laughed, ""I have many friends in England who write to me, but I have"
437,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"seen none of them for long, and I doubt I may never see them again."
438,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"Also in my youth I have been in England.""  And he sighed as at"
439,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,sorrowful recollection.
440,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
441,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"Then he showed the book in his hand.  ""See,"" he said, ""here is one of"
442,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"your English writings, the greatest book I have ever happened on.""  It"
443,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,was a volume of Mr. Fielding.  For a little he talked of books and
444,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"poets.  He admired Mr. Fielding profoundly, Dr. Smollet somewhat less,"
445,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,Mr. Richardson not at all.  But he was clear that England had a
446,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"monopoly of good writers, saving only my friend M. Rousseau, whom he"
447,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"valued, yet with reservations.  Of the Italians he had no opinion.  I"
448,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"instanced against him the plays of Signor Alfieri.  He groaned, shook"
449,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"his head, and grew moody."
450,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
451,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"""Know you Scotland?"" he asked suddenly."
452,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
453,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"I replied that I had visited Scotch cousins, but had no great"
454,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"estimation for the country.  ""It is too poor and jagged,"" I said, ""for"
455,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"the taste of one who loves colour and sunshine and suave outlines.""  He"
456,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"sighed.  ""It is indeed a bleak land, but a kindly.  When the sun shines"
457,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,at all he shines on the truest hearts in the world. I love its
458,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,bleakness too.  There is a spirit in the misty hills and the harsh
459,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,sea-wind which inspires men to great deeds.  Poverty and courage go
460,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"often together, and my Scots, if they are poor, are as untamable as"
461,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"their mountains."""
462,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
463,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"""You know the land, sir?"" I asked."
464,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
465,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"""I have seen it, and I have known many Scots.  You will find them in"
466,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"Paris and Avignon and Rome, with never a plack in their pockets.  I"
467,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"have a feeling for exiles, sir, and I have pitied these poor people."
468,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"They gave their all for the cause they followed."""
469,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
470,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,Clearly the Count shared my aunt's views of history--those views which
471,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"have made such sport for us often at Carteron.  Stalwart Whig as I am,"
472,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,there was something in the tone of the old gentleman which made me feel
473,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,a certain majesty in the lost cause.
474,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
475,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"""I am Whig in blood and Whig in principle,"" I said,--""but I have never"
476,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,denied that those Scots who followed the Chevalier were too good to
477,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"waste on so trumpery a leader."""
478,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
479,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,I had no sooner spoken the words than I felt that somehow I had been
480,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,guilty of a betise.
481,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
482,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"""It may be so,"" said the Count.  ""I did not bid you here, sir, to argue"
483,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"on politics, on which I am assured we should differ.  But I will ask"
484,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,you one question.  The King of England is a stout upholder of the right
485,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"of kings.  How does he face the defection of his American possessions?"""
486,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
487,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"""The nation takes it well enough, and as for his Majesty's feelings,"
488,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,there is small inclination to inquire into them.  I conceive of the
489,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,whole war as a blunder out of which we have come as we deserved.  The
490,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,day is gone by for the assertion of monarchic rights against the will
491,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"of a people."""
492,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
493,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"""May be.  But take note that the King of England is suffering to-day"
494,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,as--how do you call him?--the Chevalier suffered forty years ago. 'The
495,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"wheel has come full circle,' as your Shakespeare says.  Time has"
496,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"wrought his revenge."""
497,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
498,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"He was staring into a fire, which burned small and smokily."
499,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
500,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"""You think the day for kings is ended.  I read it differently.  The"
501,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,world will ever have need of kings.  If a nation cast out one it will
502,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"have to find another.  And mark you, those later kings, created by the"
503,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"people, will bear a harsher hand than the old race who ruled as of"
504,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,right.  Some day the world will regret having destroyed the kindly and
505,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,legitimate line of monarchs and put in their place tyrants who govern
506,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"by the sword or by flattering an idle mob."""
507,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
508,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"This belated dogma would at other times have set me laughing, but the"
509,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,strange figure before me gave no impulse to merriment.  I glanced at
510,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"Madame, and saw her face grave and perplexed, and I thought I read a"
511,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,warning gleam in her eye.  There was a mystery about the party which
512,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"irritated me, but good breeding forbade me to seek a clue."
513,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
514,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"""You will permit me to retire, sir,""  I said. ""I have but this morning"
515,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,come down from a long march among the mountains east of this valley.
516,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,Sleeping in wayside huts and tramping those sultry paths make a man
517,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"think pleasantly of bed."""
518,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
519,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"The Count seemed to brighten at my words.  ""You are a marcher, sir, and"
520,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"love the mountains!  Once I would gladly have joined you, for in my"
521,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"youth I was a great walker in hilly places.  Tell me, now, how many"
522,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"miles will you cover in a day?"""
523,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
524,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,I told him thirty at a stretch.
525,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
526,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"""Ah,"" he said, ""I have done fifty, without food, over the roughest and"
527,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"mossiest mountains.  I lived on what I shot, and for drink I had"
528,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"spring-water.  Nay, I am forgetting.  There was another beverage, which"
529,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"I wager you have never tasted.  Heard you ever, sir, of that eau de vie"
530,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,which the Scots call usquebagh?  It will comfort a traveller as no thin
531,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"Italian wine will comfort him.  By my soul, you shall taste it."
532,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"Charlotte, my dear, bid Oliphant fetch glasses and hot water and"
533,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,lemons.  I will give Mr. Hervey-Townshend a sample of the brew.  You
534,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"English are all tetes-de-fer, sir, and are worthy of it."""
535,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
536,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"The old man's face had lighted up, and for the moment his air had the"
537,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,jollity of youth.  I would have accepted the entertainment had I not
538,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"again caught Madame's eye.  It said, unmistakably and with serious"
539,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"pleading, ""Decline.""  I therefore made my excuses, urged fatigue,"
540,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"drowsiness, and a delicate stomach, bade my host good-night, and in"
541,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,deep mystification left the room.
542,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
543,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,Enlightenment came upon me as the door closed.  There in the threshold
544,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"stood the manservant whom they called Oliphant, erect as a sentry on"
545,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,guard.  The sight reminded me of what I had once seen at Basle when by
546,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,chance a Rhenish Grand Duke had shared the inn with me.  Of a sudden a
547,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"dozen clues linked together--the crowned notepaper, Scotland, my aunt"
548,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"Hervey's politics, the tale of old wanderings."
549,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
550,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"""Tell me,""  I said in a whisper, ""who is the Count d'Albani, your"
551,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"master?"" and I whistled softly a bar of ""Charlie is my darling."""
552,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,
553,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"""Ay,"" said the man, without relaxing a muscle of his grim face.  ""It is"
554,--CHANSONS DE FRANCE,"the King of England--my king and yours."""

559,II,II
560,II,
561,II,In the small hours of the next morning I was awoke by a most unearthly
562,II,sound.  It was as if all the cats on all the roofs of Santa Chiara were
563,II,sharpening their claws and wailing their battle-cries.  Presently out
564,II,"of the noise came a kind of music--very slow, solemn, and melancholy."
565,II,"The notes ran up in great flights of ecstasy, and sunk anon to the"
566,II,tragic deeps.  In spite of my sleepiness I was held spellbound and the
567,II,musician had concluded with certain barbaric grunts before I had the
568,II,"curiosity to rise.  It came from somewhere in the gallery of the inn,"
569,II,"and as I stuck my head out of my door I had a glimpse of Oliphant,"
570,II,"nightcap on head and a great bagpipe below his arm, stalking down the"
571,II,corridor.
572,II,
573,II,"The incident, for all the gravity of the music, seemed to give a touch"
574,II,of farce to my interview of the past evening.  I had gone to bed with
575,II,my mind full of sad stories of the deaths of kings.  Magnificence in
576,II,tatters has always affected my pity more deeply than tatters with no
577,II,"such antecedent, and a monarch out at elbows stood for me as the last"
578,II,irony of our mortal life.  Here was a king whose misfortunes could find
579,II,"no parallel.  He had been in his youth the hero of a high adventure,"
580,II,and his middle age had been spent in fleeting among the courts of
581,II,"Europe, and waiting as pensioner on the whims of his foolish but"
582,II,"regnant brethren.  I had heard tales of a growing sottishness, a"
583,II,"decline in spirit, a squalid taste in pleasures.  Small blame, I had"
584,II,"always thought, to so ill-fated a princeling.  And now I had chanced"
585,II,"upon the gentleman in his dotage, travelling with a barren effort at"
586,II,"mystery, attended by a sad-faced daughter and two ancient domestics."
587,II,It was a lesson in the vanity of human wishes which the shallowest
588,II,"moralist would have noted.  Nay, I felt more than the moral.  Something"
589,II,human and kindly in the old fellow had caught my fancy.  The decadence
590,II,"was too tragic to prose about, the decadent too human to moralise on."
591,II,I had left the chamber of the--shall I say de jure King of England?--a
592,II,sentimental adherent of the cause.  But this business of the bagpipes
593,II,touched the comic.  To harry an old valet out of bed and set him
594,II,"droning on pipes in the small hours smacked of a theatrical taste, or"
595,II,"at least of an undignified fancy.  Kings in exile, if they wish to keep"
596,II,"the tragic air, should not indulge in such fantastic serenades."
597,II,
598,II,My mind changed again when after breakfast I fell in with Madame on the
599,II,"stair. She drew aside to let me pass, and then made as if she would"
600,II,"speak to me.  I gave her good-morning, and, my mind being full of her"
601,II,"story, addressed her as ""Excellency."""
602,II,
603,II,"""I see, sir,"" she said, ""That you know the truth.  I have to ask your"
604,II,forbearance for the concealment I practised yesterday.  It was a poor
605,II,"requital for your generosity, but is it one of the shifts of our sad"
606,II,fortune. An uncrowned king must go in disguise or risk the laughter of
607,II,"every stable-boy. Besides, we are too poor to travel in state, even if"
608,II,"we desired it."""
609,II,
610,II,"Honestly, I knew not what to say. I was not asked to sympathise, having"
611,II,"already revealed my politics, and yet the case cried out for sympathy."
612,II,"You remember, my dear aunt, the good Lady Culham, who was our"
613,II,"Dorsetshire neighbour, and tried hard to mend my ways at Carteron?"
614,II,This poor Duchess--for so she called herself--was just such another.  A
615,II,"woman made for comfort, housewifery, and motherhood, and by no means"
616,II,for racing about Europe in charge of a disreputable parent.  I could
617,II,picture her settled equably on a garden seat with a lapdog and
618,II,"needlework, blinking happily over green lawns and mildly rating an"
619,II,"errant gardener.  I could fancy her sitting in a summer parlour, very"
620,II,"orderly and dainty, writing lengthy epistles to a tribe of nieces.  I"
621,II,"could see her marshalling a household in the family pew, or riding"
622,II,"serenely in the family coach behind fat bay horses.  But here, on an"
623,II,"inn staircase, with a false name and a sad air of mystery, she was"
624,II,woefully out of place.  I noted little wrinkles forming in the corners
625,II,"of her eyes, and the ravages of care beginning in the plump rosiness of"
626,II,her face.  Be sure there was nothing appealing in her mien. She spoke
627,II,"with the air of a great lady, to whom the world is matter only for an"
628,II,afterthought.  It was the facts that appealed and grew poignant from
629,II,her courage.
630,II,
631,II,"""There is another claim upon your good nature,"" she said.  ""Doubtless"
632,II,you were awoke last night by Oliphant's playing upon the pipes.  I
633,II,"rebuked the landlord for his insolence in protesting, but to you, a"
634,II,"gentleman and a friend, an explanation is due.  My father sleeps ill,"
635,II,and your conversation seems to have cast him into a train of sad
636,II,memories.  It has been his habit on such occasions to have the pipes
637,II,"played to him, since they remind him of friends and happier days.  It"
638,II,"is a small privilege for an old man, and he does not claim it often."""
639,II,
640,II,"I declared that the music had only pleased, and that I would welcome"
641,II,its repetition. Where upon she left me with a little bow and an
642,II,"invitation to join them that day at dinner, while I departed into the"
643,II,"town on my own errands.  I returned before midday, and was seated at an"
644,II,"arbour in the garden, busy with letters, when there hove in sight the"
645,II,"gaunt figure of Oliphant.  He hovered around me, if such a figure can"
646,II,"be said to hover, with the obvious intention of addressing me.  The"
647,II,"fellow had caught my fancy, and I was willing to see more of him.  His"
648,II,"face might have been hacked out of grey granite, his clothes hung"
649,II,"loosely on his spare bones, and his stockined shanks would have done no"
650,II,"discredit to Don Quixote.  There was no dignity in his air, only a"
651,II,"steady and enduring sadness.  Here, thought I, is the one of the"
652,II,establishment who most commonly meets the shock of the world's buffets.
653,II,I called him by name and asked him his desires.
654,II,
655,II,"It appeared that he took me for a Jacobite, for he began a rigmarole"
656,II,"about loyalty and hard fortune.  I hastened to correct him, and he took"
657,II,the correction with the same patient despair with which he took all
658,II,things. 'Twas but another of the blows of Fate.
659,II,
660,II,"""At any rate,"" he said in a broad Scotch accent, ""ye come of kin that"
661,II,has helpit my maister afore this.  I've many times heard tell o'
662,II,"Herveys and Townshends in England, and a' folk said they were on the"
663,II,"richt side.  Ye're maybe no a freend, but ye're a freend's freend, or I"
664,II,"wadna be speirin' at ye."""
665,II,
666,II,"I was amused at the prologue, and waited on the tale.  It soon came."
667,II,"Oliphant, it appeared, was the purse-bearer of the household, and"
668,II,woeful straits that poor purse-bearer must have been often put to.  I
669,II,"questioned him as to his master's revenues, but could get no clear"
670,II,answer. There were payments due next month in Florence which would
671,II,"solve the difficulties for the winter, but in the meantime expenditure"
672,II,"had beaten income.  Travelling had cost much, and the Count must have"
673,II,his small comforts.  The result in plain words was that Oliphant had
674,II,"not the wherewithal to frank the company to Florence; indeed, I doubted"
675,II,if he could have paid the reckoning in Santa Chiara.  A loan was
676,II,"therefore sought from a friend's friend, meaning myself."
677,II,
678,II,I was very really embarrassed.  Not that I would not have given
679,II,"willingly, for I had ample resources at the moment and was mightily"
680,II,concerned about the sad household.  But I knew that the little Duchess
681,II,would take Oliphant's ears from his head if she guessed that he had
682,II,"dared to borrow from me, and that, if I lent, her back would for ever"
683,II,"be turned against me.  And yet, what would follow on my refusal?  In a"
684,II,"day of two there would be a pitiful scene with mine host, and as like"
685,II,as not some of their baggage detained as security for payment.  I did
686,II,"not love the task of conspiring behind the lady's back, but if it could"
687,II,be contrived 'twas indubitably the kindest course.  I glared sternly at
688,II,"Oliphant, who met me with his pathetic, dog-like eyes."
689,II,
690,II,"""You know that your mistress would never consent to the request you"
691,II,"have made of me?"""
692,II,
693,II,"""I ken,"" he said humbly.  ""But payin' is my job, and I simply havena"
694,II,"the siller.  It's no the first time it has happened, and it's a sair"
695,II,trial for them both to be flung out o' doors by a foreign hostler
696,II,"because they canna meet his charges.  But, sir, if ye can lend to me,"
697,II,"ye may be certain that her leddyship will never, hear a word o't.  Puir"
698,II,"thing, she takes nae thocht o' where the siller comes frae, ony mair"
699,II,"than the lilies o' the field."""
700,II,
701,II,"I became a conspirator.  ""You swear, Oliphant, by all you hold sacred,"
702,II,"to breathe nothing of this to your mistress, and if she should suspect,"
703,II,"to lie like a Privy Councillor?"""
704,II,
705,II,"A flicker of a smile crossed his face.  ""I'll lee like a Scotch"
706,II,"packman, and the Father o' lees could do nae mair.  You need have no"
707,II,"fear for your siller, sir.  I've aye repaid when I borrowed, though you"
708,II,"may have to wait a bittock.""  And the strange fellow strolled off."
709,II,
710,II,"At dinner no Duchess appeared till long after the appointed hour, nor"
711,II,"was there any sign of Oliphant.  When she came at last with Cristine,"
712,II,"her eyes looked as if she had been crying, and she greeted me with"
713,II,remote courtesy.  My first thought was that Oliphant had revealed the
714,II,"matter of the loan, but presently I found that the lady's trouble was"
715,II,"far different.  Her father, it seemed, was ill again with his old"
716,II,"complaint.  What that was I did not ask, nor did the Duchess reveal it."
717,II,
718,II,"We spoke in French, for I had discovered that this was her favourite"
719,II,"speech.  There was no Oliphant to wait on us, and the inn servants were"
720,II,"always about, so it was well to have a tongue they did not comprehend."
721,II,The lady was distracted and sad.  When I inquired feelingly as to the
722,II,"general condition of her father's health she parried the question, and"
723,II,when I offered my services she disregarded my words.  It was in truth a
724,II,"doleful meal, while the faded Cristine sat like a sphinx staring into"
725,II,"vacancy.  I spoke of England and of her friends, of Paris and"
726,II,"Versailles, of Avignon where she had spent some years, and of the"
727,II,"amenities of Florence, which she considered her home.  But it was like"
728,II,"talking to a nunnery door.  I got nothing but ""It is indeed true, sir,"""
729,II,"or ""Do you say so, sir!""  till my energy began to sink.  Madame"
730,II,"perceived my discomfort, and, as she rose, murmured an apology.  ""Pray"
731,II,"forgive my distraction, but I am poor company when my father is ill.  I"
732,II,"have a foolish mind, easily frightened.  Nay, nay!"" she went on when I"
733,II,"again offered help, ""the illness is trifling. It will pass off by"
734,II,"to-morrow, or at the latest the next day.  Only I had looked forward to"
735,II,"some ease at Santa Chiara, and the promise is belied."""
736,II,
737,II,"As it chanced that evening, returning to the inn, I passed by the north"
738,II,side where the windows of the Count's room looked over a little
739,II,"flower-garden abutting on the courtyard.  The dusk was falling, and a"
740,II,lamp had been lit which gave a glimpse into the interior.  The sick man
741,II,"was standing by the window, his figure flung into relief by the"
742,II,"lamplight.  If he was sick, his sickness was of a curious type.  His"
743,II,"face was ruddy, his eye wild, and, his wig being off, his scanty hair"
744,II,"stood up oddly round his head.  He seemed to be singing, but I could"
745,II,not catch the sound through the shut casement.  Another figure in the
746,II,"room, probably Oliphant, laid a hand on the Count's shoulder, drew him"
747,II,"from the window, and closed the shutter."
748,II,
749,II,It needed only the recollection of stories which were the property of
750,II,all Europe to reach a conclusion on the gentleman's illness.  The
751,II,legitimate King of England was very drunk.
752,II,
753,II,As I went to my room that night I passed the Count's door. There stood
754,II,"Oliphant as sentry, more grim and haggard than ever, and I thought that"
755,II,his eye met mine with a certain intelligence.  From inside the room
756,II,"came a great racket.  There was the sound of glasses falling, then a"
757,II,"string of oaths, English, French, and for all I know, Irish, rapped out"
758,II,"in a loud drunken voice.  A pause, and then came the sound of maudlin"
759,II,"singing.  It pursued me along the gallery, an old childish song,"
760,II,delivered as if 'twere a pot-house catch--
761,II,
762,II,"""Qu'est-ce qui passe ici si tard,"
763,II,"Compagnons de la Marjolaine--"""
764,II,
765,II,One of the late-going company of the Marjolaine hastened to bed.  This
766,II,"king in exile, with his melancholy daughter, was becoming too much for"
767,II,him.
768,II,
769,II,
770,II,
771,II,
772,III,III
773,III,
774,III,It was just before noon next day that the travellers arrived.  I was
775,III,"sitting in the shady loggia of the inn, reading a volume of De Thou,"
776,III,when there drove up to the door two coaches.  Out of the first
777,III,descended very slowly and stiffly four gentlemen; out of the second
778,III,four servants and a quantity of baggage.  As it chanced there was no
779,III,"one about, the courtyard slept its sunny noontide sleep, and the only"
780,III,movement was a lizard on the wall and a buzz of flies by the fountain.
781,III,"Seeing no sign of the landlord, one of the travellers approached me"
782,III,with a grave inclination.
783,III,
784,III,"""This is the inn called the Tre Croci, sir?"" he asked."
785,III,
786,III,"I said it was, and shouted on my own account for the host.  Presently"
787,III,"that personage arrived with a red face and a short wind, having"
788,III,ascended rapidly from his own cellar.  He was awed by the dignity of
789,III,"the travellers, and made none of his usual protests of incapacity.  The"
790,III,"servants filed off solemnly with the baggage, and the four gentlemen"
791,III,set themselves down beside me in the loggia and ordered each a modest
792,III,flask of wine.
793,III,
794,III,"At first I took them for our countrymen, but as I watched them the"
795,III,conviction vanished.  All four were tall and lean beyond the average of
796,III,"mankind.  They wore suits of black, with antique starched frills to"
797,III,their shirts; their hair was their own and unpowdered.  Massive buckles
798,III,"of an ancient pattern adorned their square-toed shoes, and the canes"
799,III,they carried were like the yards of a small vessel.  They were four
800,III,"merchants, I had guessed, of Scotland, maybe, or of Newcastle, but"
801,III,"their voices were not Scotch, and their air had no touch of commerce."
802,III,"Take the heavy-browed preoccupation of a Secretary of State, add the"
803,III,"dignity of a bishop, the sunburn of a fox-hunter, and something of the"
804,III,"disciplined erectness of a soldier, and you may perceive the manner of"
805,III,these four gentlemen.  By the side of them my assurance vanished.
806,III,Compared with their Olympian serenity my Person seemed fussy and
807,III,"servile.  Even so, I mused, must Mr. Franklin have looked when baited"
808,III,in Parliament by the Tory pack.  The reflection gave me the cue.
809,III,"Presently I caught from their conversation the word ""Washington,""  and"
810,III,the truth flashed upon me.  I was in the presence of four of Mr.
811,III,"Franklin's countrymen.  Having never seen an American in the flesh, I"
812,III,rejoiced at the chance of enlarging my acquaintance.
813,III,
814,III,They brought me into the circle by a polite question as to the length
815,III,of road to Verona.  Soon introductions followed.  My name intrigued
816,III,"them, and they were eager to learn of my kinship to Uncle Charles.  The"
817,III,"eldest of the four, it appeared, was Mr. Galloway out of Maryland."
818,III,"Then came two brothers, Sylvester by name, of Pennsylvania, and last"
819,III,"Mr. Fish, a lawyer of New York.  All four had campaigned in the late"
820,III,"war, and all four were members of the Convention, or whatever they call"
821,III,"their rough-and-ready parliament.  They were modest in their behaviour,"
822,III,"much disinclined to speak of their past, as great men might be whose"
823,III,reputation was world-wide.  Somehow the names stuck in my memory.  I
824,III,was certain that I had heard them linked with some stalwart fight or
825,III,some moving civil deed or some defiant manifesto.  The making of
826,III,history was in their steadfast eye and the grave lines of the mouth.
827,III,"Our friendship flourished mightily in a brief hour, and brought me the"
828,III,"invitation, willingly accepted, to sit with them at dinner."
829,III,
830,III,There was no sign of the Duchess or Cristine or Oliphant.  Whatever had
831,III,"happened, that household to-day required all hands on deck, and I was"
832,III,left alone with the Americans.  In my day I have supped with the
833,III,"Macaronies, I have held up my head at the Cocoa Tree, I have avoided"
834,III,"the floor at hunt dinners, I have drunk glass to glass with Tom"
835,III,Carteron.  But never before have I seen such noble consumers of good
836,III,liquor as those four gentlemen from beyond the Atlantic.  They drank
837,III,"the strong red Cyprus as if it had been spring-water.  ""The dust of"
838,III,"your Italian roads takes some cleansing, Mr. Townshend,"" was their only"
839,III,"excuse, but in truth none was needed.  The wine seemed only to thaw"
840,III,their iron decorum.  Without any surcease of dignity they grew
841,III,"communicative, and passed from lands to peoples and from peoples to"
842,III,constitutions.  Before we knew it we were embarked upon high politics.
843,III,
844,III,"Naturally we did not differ on the war.  Like me, they held it to have"
845,III,"been a grievous necessity.  They had no bitterness against England,"
846,III,"only regrets for her blunders.  Of his Majesty they spoke with respect,"
847,III,of his Majesty's advisers with dignified condemnation.  They thought
848,III,highly of our troops in America; less highly of our generals.
849,III,
850,III,"""Look you, sir,"" said Mr. Galloway, ""in a war such as we have witnessed"
851,III,the Almighty is the only strategist. You fight against the forces of
852,III,"Nature, and a newcomer little knows that the success or failure of"
853,III,"every operation he can conceive depends not upon generalship, but upon"
854,III,"the confirmation of a vast country.  Our generals, with this in mind"
855,III,"and with fewer men, could make all your schemes miscarry.  Had the"
856,III,"English soldiers not been of such stubborn stuff, we should have been"
857,III,victors from the first.  Our leader was not General Washington but
858,III,"General America, and his brigadiers were forests, swamps, lakes,"
859,III,"rivers, and high mountains."""
860,III,
861,III,"""And now,""  I said, ""having won, you have the greatest of human"
862,III,experiments before you.  Your business is to show that the Saxon stock
863,III,"is adaptable to a republic."""
864,III,
865,III,It seemed to me that they exchanged glances.
866,III,
867,III,"""We are not pedants,"" said Mr. Fish, ""and have no desire to dispute"
868,III,about the form of a constitution.  A people may be as free under a king
869,III,"as under a senate.  Liberty is not the lackey of any type of government."""
870,III,
871,III,These were strange words from a member of a race whom I had thought
872,III,wedded to the republicanism of Helvidius Priscus.
873,III,
874,III,"""As a loyal subject of a monarchy,""  I said, ""I must agree with you."
875,III,"But your hands are tied, for I cannot picture the establishment of a"
876,III,"House of Washington and--if not, where are you to turn for your"
877,III,"sovereign?"""
878,III,
879,III,Again a smile seemed to pass among the four.
880,III,
881,III,"""We are experimenters, as you say, sir, and must go slowly.  In the"
882,III,"meantime, we have an authority which keeps peace and property safe.  We"
883,III,"are at leisure to cast our eyes round and meditate on the future."""
884,III,
885,III,"""Then, gentlemen,"" said I, ""you take an excellent way of meditation in"
886,III,visiting this museum of old sovereignties.  Here you have the relics of
887,III,"any government you please--a dozen republics, tyrannies, theocracies,"
888,III,"merchant confederations, kingdoms, and more than one empire.  You have"
889,III,"your choice.  I am tolerably familiar with the land, and if I can"
890,III,"assist you I am at your service."""
891,III,
892,III,"They thanked me gravely ""We have letters,"" said Mr. Galloway; ""one in"
893,III,especial is to a gentleman whom we hope to meet in this place.  Have
894,III,"you heard in your travels of the Count of Albany?"""
895,III,
896,III,"""He has arrived,"" said I, ""two days ago.  Even now he is in the chamber"
897,III,"above us at dinner."""
898,III,
899,III,The news interested them hugely.
900,III,
901,III,"""You have seen him?"" they cried.  ""What is he like?"""
902,III,
903,III,"""An elderly gentleman in poor health, a man who has travelled much,"
904,III,"and, I judge, has suffered something from fortune.  He has a fondness"
905,III,"for the English, so you will be welcome, sirs; but he was indisposed"
906,III,"yesterday, and may still be unable to receive you.  His daughter"
907,III,"travels with him and tends his old age."""
908,III,
909,III,"""And you--you have spoken with him?"""
910,III,
911,III,"""The night before last I was in his company.  We talked of many things,"
912,III,including the late war.  He is somewhat of your opinion on matters of
913,III,"government."""
914,III,
915,III,"The four looked at each other, and then Mr. Galloway rose."
916,III,
917,III,"""I ask your permission, Mr. Townshend, to consult for a moment with my"
918,III,"friends.  The matter is of some importance, and I would beg you to"
919,III,"await us.""  So saying, he led the others out of doors, and I heard them"
920,III,"withdraw to a corner of the loggia.  Now, thought I, there is something"
921,III,"afoot, and my long-sought romance approaches fruition.  The company of"
922,III,"the Marjolaine, whom the Count had sung of, have arrived at last."
923,III,
924,III,Presently they returned and seated themselves at the table.
925,III,
926,III,"""You can be of great assistance to us, Mr. Townshend, and we would fain"
927,III,take you into our confidence.  Are you aware who is this Count of
928,III,"Albany?"""
929,III,
930,III,"I nodded.  ""It is a thin disguise to one familiar with history."""
931,III,
932,III,"""Have you reached any estimate of his character or capabilities?  You"
933,III,"speak to friends, and, let me tell you, it is a matter which deeply"
934,III,"concerns the Count's interests."""
935,III,
936,III,"""I think him a kindly and pathetic old gentleman.  He naturally bears"
937,III,"the mark of forty years' sojourn in the wilderness."""
938,III,
939,III,Mr. Galloway took snuff.
940,III,
941,III,"""We have business with him, but it is business which stands in need of"
942,III,an agent.  There is no one in the Count's suite with whom we could
943,III,"discuss affairs?"""
944,III,
945,III,"""There is his daughter."""
946,III,
947,III,"""Ah, but she would scarcely suit the case. Is there no man--a friend,"
948,III,"and yet not a member of the family who can treat with us?"""
949,III,
950,III,I replied that I thought that I was the only being in Santa Chiara who
951,III,answered the description.
952,III,
953,III,"""If you will accept the task, Mr. Townshend, you are amply qualified."
954,III,We will be frank with you and reveal our business.  We are on no less
955,III,"an errand than to offer the Count of Albany a crown."""
956,III,
957,III,"I suppose I must have had some suspicion of their purpose, and yet the"
958,III,revelation of it fell on me like a thunderclap.  I could only stare
959,III,owlishly at my four grave gentlemen.
960,III,
961,III,"Mr. Galloway went on unperturbed.  ""I have told you that in America we"
962,III,are not yet republicans.  There are those among us who favour a
963,III,"republic, but they are by no means a majority.  We have got rid of a"
964,III,"king who misgoverned us, but we have no wish to get rid of kingship."
965,III,"We want a king of our own choosing, and we would get with him all the"
966,III,ancient sanctions of monarchy.  The Count of Albany is of the most
967,III,"illustrious royal stock in Europe--he is, if legitimacy goes for"
968,III,"anything, the rightful King of Britain.  Now, if the republican party"
969,III,"among us is to be worsted, we must come before the nation with a"
970,III,powerful candidate for their favour. You perceive my drift?  What more
971,III,potent appeal to American pride than to say: 'We have got rid of King
972,III,George; we choose of our own free will the older line and King
973,III,"Charles'?"""
974,III,
975,III,"I said foolishly that I thought monarchy had had its day, and that"
976,III,'twas idle to revive it.
977,III,
978,III,"""That is a sentiment well enough under a monarchical government; but"
979,III,"we, with a clean page to write upon, do not share it.  You know your"
980,III,ancient historians.  Has not the repository of the chief power always
981,III,been the rock on which republicanism has shipwrecked?  If that power is
982,III,"given to the chief citizen, the way is prepared for the tyrant.  If it"
983,III,"abides peacefully in a royal house, it abides with cyphers who dignify,"
984,III,"without obstructing, a popular constitution.  Do not mistake me, Mr."
985,III,"Townshend.  This is no whim of a sentimental girl, but the reasoned"
986,III,conclusion of the men who achieved our liberty.  There is every reason
987,III,"to believe that General Washington shares our views, and Mr. Hamilton,"
988,III,"whose name you may know, is the inspirer of our mission."""
989,III,
990,III,"""But the Count is an old man,""  I urged; for I knew not where to begin"
991,III,in my exposition of the hopelessness of their errand.
992,III,
993,III,"""By so much the better.  We do not wish a young king who may be"
994,III,fractious.  An old man tempered by misfortune is what our purpose
995,III,"demands."""
996,III,
997,III,"""He has also his failings. A man cannot lead his life for forty years"
998,III,"and retain all the virtues."""
999,III,
1000,III,"At that one of the Sylvesters spoke sharply.  ""I have heard such"
1001,III,"gossip, but I do not credit it.  I have not forgotten Preston and"
1002,III,"Derby."""
1003,III,
1004,III,"I made my last objection.  ""He has no posterity--legitimate"
1005,III,"posterity--to carry on his line."""
1006,III,
1007,III,"The four gentlemen smiled.  ""That happens to be his chiefest"
1008,III,"recommendation,"" said Mr. Galloway.  ""It enables us to take the House"
1009,III,of Stuart on trial.  We need a breathing-space and leisure to look
1010,III,around; but unless we establish the principle of monarchy at once the
1011,III,"republicans will forestall us.  Let us get our king at all costs, and"
1012,III,during the remaining years of his life we shall have time to settle the
1013,III,succession problem.
1014,III,
1015,III,"""We have no wish to saddle ourselves for good with a race who might"
1016,III,"prove burdensome.  If King Charles fails he has no son, and we can look"
1017,III,"elsewhere for a better monarch.  You perceive the reason of my view?"""
1018,III,
1019,III,"I did, and I also perceived the colossal absurdity of the whole"
1020,III,"business. But I could not convince them of it, for they met my"
1021,III,objections with excellent arguments.  Nothing save a sight of the Count
1022,III,"would, I feared, disillusion them."
1023,III,
1024,III,"""You wish me to make this proposal on your behalf?""  I asked."
1025,III,
1026,III,"""We shall make the proposal ourselves, but we desire you to prepare the"
1027,III,"way for us.  He is an elderly man, and should first be informed of our"
1028,III,"purpose."""
1029,III,
1030,III,"""There is one person whom I beg leave to consult--the Duchess, his"
1031,III,daughter.  It may be that the present is an ill moment for approaching
1032,III,"the Count, and the affair requires her sanction."""
1033,III,
1034,III,"They agreed, and with a very perplexed mind I went forth to seek the"
1035,III,"lady.  The irony of the thing was too cruel, and my heart ached for"
1036,III,"her.  In the gallery I found Oliphant packing some very shabby trunks,"
1037,III,and when I questioned him he told me that the family were to leave
1038,III,Santa Chiara on the morrow.  Perchance the Duchess had awakened to the
1039,III,"true state of their exchequer, or perchance she thought it well to get"
1040,III,her father on the road again as a cure for his ailment.
1041,III,
1042,III,"I discovered Cristine, and begged for an interview with her mistress on"
1043,III,"an urgent matter.  She led me to the Duchess's room, and there the"
1044,III,evidence of poverty greeted me openly.  All the little luxuries of the
1045,III,menage had gone to the Count.  The poor lady's room was no better than
1046,III,"a servant's garret, and the lady herself sat stitching a rent in a"
1047,III,travelling cloak.  She rose to greet me with alarm in her eyes.
1048,III,
1049,III,As briefly as I could I set out the facts of my amazing mission.  At
1050,III,"first she seemed scarcely to hear me.  ""What do they want with him?"""
1051,III,"she asked.  ""He can give them nothing.  He is no friend to the"
1052,III,"Americans or to any people who have deposed their sovereign.""  Then, as"
1053,III,"she grasped my meaning, her face flushed."
1054,III,
1055,III,"""It is a heartless trick, Mr. Townshend.  I would fain think you no"
1056,III,"party to it."""
1057,III,
1058,III,"""Believe me, dear madame, it is no trick.  The men below are in sober"
1059,III,earnest.  You have but to see their faces to know that theirs is no
1060,III,wild adventure.  I believe sincerely that they have the power to
1061,III,"implement their promise."""
1062,III,
1063,III,"""But it is madness.  He is old and worn and sick.  His day is long past"
1064,III,"for winning a crown."""
1065,III,
1066,III,"""All this I have said, but it does not move them.""   And I told her"
1067,III,"rapidly Mr. Galloway's argument.  She fell into a muse.  ""At the"
1068,III,"eleventh hour!  Nay, too late, too late.  Had he been twenty years"
1069,III,"younger, what a stroke of fortune!  Fate bears too hard on us, too"
1070,III,"hard!"""
1071,III,
1072,III,"Then she turned to me fiercely.  ""You have no doubt heard, sir, the"
1073,III,"gossip about my father, which is on the lips of every fool in Europe."
1074,III,Let us have done with this pitiful make-believe.  My father is a sot.
1075,III,"Nay, I do not blame him.  I blame his enemies and his miserable"
1076,III,"destiny.  But there is the fact.  Were he not old, he would still be"
1077,III,unfit to grasp a crown and rule over a turbulent people.  He flees from
1078,III,"one city to another, but he cannot flee from himself.  That is his"
1079,III,"illness on which you condoled with me yesterday."""
1080,III,
1081,III,The lady's control was at breaking-point.  Another moment and I
1082,III,expected a torrent of tears.  But they did not come.  With a great

1119,III,"among for years.  All I ask for myself and my father is a little peace,"
1120,III,"and, by Heaven! I shall secure it.  If nothing will kill your"

1129,III,
1130,III,"""Good!"" said Mr. Galloway, and all four, grave gentlemen as they were,"
1131,III,seemed to brace themselves to a special dignity as befitted ambassadors
1132,III,"to a king.  I led them upstairs, tapped at the Count's door, and,"
1133,III,"getting no answer, opened it and admitted them."
1134,III,
1135,III,"And this was what we saw. The furniture was in disorder, and on a couch"
1136,III,lay an old man sleeping a heavy drunken sleep.  His mouth was open and
1137,III,"his breath came stertorously.  The face was purple, and large purple"
1138,III,veins stood out on the mottled forehead.  His scanty white hair was
1139,III,"draggled over his cheek.  On the floor was a broken glass, wet stains"
1140,III,"still lay on the boards, and the place reeked of spirits.  The four"
1141,III,looked for a second--I do not think longer at him whom they would have
1142,III,made their king.  They did not look at each other.  With one accord
1143,III,"they moved out, and Mr. Fish, who was last, closed the door very gently"
1144,III,behind him.
1145,III,
1146,III,"In the hall below Mr. Galloway turned to me.  ""Our mission is ended,"

1152,III,An hour later two coaches rolled out of the courtyard of the Tre Croci.
1153,III,"As they passed, a window was half-opened on the upper floor, and a head"
1154,III,"looked out.  A line of a song came down, a song sung in a strange"
1155,III,quavering voice.  It was the catch I had heard the night before:

1224,A LUCID INTERVAL,"gave the key into my hands."""
1225,A LUCID INTERVAL,
1226,A LUCID INTERVAL,"Lady Caerlaverock is my aunt, and I was present at the two remarkable"
1227,A LUCID INTERVAL,dinner-parties which form the main events in this tale.  I was also
1228,A LUCID INTERVAL,taken into her confidence during the terrible fortnight which
1229,A LUCID INTERVAL,"intervened between them.  Like everybody else, I was hopelessly in the"
1230,A LUCID INTERVAL,"dark, and could only accept what happened as a divine interposition."
1231,A LUCID INTERVAL,"My first clue came when James, the Caerlaverocks' second footman,"
1232,A LUCID INTERVAL,"entered my service as valet, and being a cheerful youth chose to gossip"
1233,A LUCID INTERVAL,"while he shaved me.  I checked him, but he babbled on, and I could not"
1234,A LUCID INTERVAL,choose but learn something about the disposition of the Caerlaverock
1235,A LUCID INTERVAL,household below stairs.  I learned--what I knew before--that his
1236,A LUCID INTERVAL,"lordship had an inordinate love for curries, a taste acquired during"
1237,A LUCID INTERVAL,some troubled years as Indian Viceroy.  I had often eaten that
1238,A LUCID INTERVAL,"admirable dish at his table, and had heard him boast of the skill of"
1239,A LUCID INTERVAL,"the Indian cook who prepared it.  James, it appeared, did not hold with"
1240,A LUCID INTERVAL,the Orient in the kitchen.  He described the said Indian gentleman as a
1241,A LUCID INTERVAL,"""nigger,"" and expressed profound distrust of his ways.  He referred"
1242,A LUCID INTERVAL,"darkly to the events of the year before, which in some distorted way"
1243,A LUCID INTERVAL,"had reached the servants' ears.  ""We always thought as 'ow it was them"
1244,A LUCID INTERVAL,"niggers as done it,"" he declared; and when I questioned him on his use"
1245,A LUCID INTERVAL,"of the plural, admitted that at the time in question ""there 'ad been"
1246,A LUCID INTERVAL,"more nor one nigger 'anging about the kitchen."""
1247,A LUCID INTERVAL,
1248,A LUCID INTERVAL,"Pondering on these sayings, I asked myself if it were not possible that"
1249,A LUCID INTERVAL,the behaviour of certain eminent statesmen was due to some strange
1250,A LUCID INTERVAL,"devilry of the East, and I made a vow to abstain in future from the"
1251,A LUCID INTERVAL,"Caerlaverock curries.  But last month my brother returned from India,"
1252,A LUCID INTERVAL,"and I got the whole truth.  He was staying with me in Scotland, and in"
1253,A LUCID INTERVAL,the smoking-room the talk turned on occultism in the East.  I declared
1254,A LUCID INTERVAL,"myself a sceptic, and George was stirred.  He asked me rudely what I"
1255,A LUCID INTERVAL,"knew about it, and proceeded to make a startling confession of faith."
1256,A LUCID INTERVAL,"He was cross-examined by the others, and retorted with some of his"
1257,A LUCID INTERVAL,"experiences.  Finding an incredulous audience, his tales became more"
1258,A LUCID INTERVAL,"defiant, until he capped them all with one monstrous yarn.  He"
1259,A LUCID INTERVAL,maintained that in a Hindu family of his acquaintance there had been
1260,A LUCID INTERVAL,"transmitted the secret of a drug, capable of altering a man's whole"
1261,A LUCID INTERVAL,temperament until the antidote was administered.  It would turn a
1262,A LUCID INTERVAL,"coward into a bravo, a miser into a spendthrift, a rake into a fakir."
1263,A LUCID INTERVAL,"Then, having delivered his manifesto he got up abruptly and went to bed."
1264,A LUCID INTERVAL,
1265,A LUCID INTERVAL,"I followed him to his room, for something in the story had revived a"
1266,A LUCID INTERVAL,memory.  By dint of much persuasion I dragged from the somnolent George
1267,A LUCID INTERVAL,"various details.  The family in question were Beharis, large"
1268,A LUCID INTERVAL,landholders dwelling near the Nepal border.  He had known old Ram Singh
1269,A LUCID INTERVAL,"for years, and had seen him twice since his return from England.  He"
1270,A LUCID INTERVAL,"got the story from him under no promise of secrecy, for the family drug"
1271,A LUCID INTERVAL,was as well known in the neighbourhood as the nine incarnations of
1272,A LUCID INTERVAL,"Krishna.  He had no doubt about the truth of it, for he had positive"
1273,A LUCID INTERVAL,"proof.  ""And others besides me,"" said George.  ""Do you remember when"
1274,A LUCID INTERVAL,Vennard had a lucid interval a couple of years ago and talked sense for
1275,A LUCID INTERVAL,"once?  That was old Ram Singh's doing, for he told me about it."""
1276,A LUCID INTERVAL,
1277,A LUCID INTERVAL,Three years ago it seems the Government of India saw fit to appoint a
1278,A LUCID INTERVAL,commission to inquire into land tenure on the Nepal border.  Some of
1279,A LUCID INTERVAL,"the feudal Rajahs had been ""birsing yont,"" like the Breadalbanes, and"
1280,A LUCID INTERVAL,the smaller zemindars were gravely disquieted.  The result of the
1281,A LUCID INTERVAL,"commission was that Ram Singh had his boundaries rectified, and lost a"
1282,A LUCID INTERVAL,mile or two of country which his hard-fisted fathers had won.
1283,A LUCID INTERVAL,
1284,A LUCID INTERVAL,"I know nothing of the rights of the matter, but there can be no doubt"
1285,A LUCID INTERVAL,"about Ram Singh's dissatisfaction.  He appealed to the law courts, but"
1286,A LUCID INTERVAL,"failed to upset the commission's finding, and the Privy Council upheld"
1287,A LUCID INTERVAL,the Indian judgment.  Thereupon in a flowery and eloquent document he
1288,A LUCID INTERVAL,"laid his case before the Viceroy, and was told that the matter was"
1289,A LUCID INTERVAL,"closed.  Now Ram Singh came of a fighting stock, so he straightway took"
1290,A LUCID INTERVAL,"ship to England to petition the Crown.  He petitioned Parliament, but"
1291,A LUCID INTERVAL,"his petition went into the bag behind the Speaker's chair, from which"
1292,A LUCID INTERVAL,"there is no return.  He petitioned the King, but was courteously"
1293,A LUCID INTERVAL,informed that he must approach the Department concerned.  He tried the
1294,A LUCID INTERVAL,"Secretary of State for India, and had an interview with Abinger"
1295,A LUCID INTERVAL,"Vennard, who was very rude to him, and succeeded in mortally insulting"
1296,A LUCID INTERVAL,"the feudal aristocrat.  He appealed to the Prime Minister, and was"
1297,A LUCID INTERVAL,warned off by a harassed private secretary.  The handful of members of
1298,A LUCID INTERVAL,Parliament who make Indian grievances their stock-in-trade fought shy
1299,A LUCID INTERVAL,"of him, for indeed Ram Singh's case had no sort of platform appeal in"
1300,A LUCID INTERVAL,"it, and his arguments were flagrantly undemocratic.  But they sent him"
1301,A LUCID INTERVAL,"to Lord Caerlaverock, for the ex-viceroy loved to be treated as a kind"
1302,A LUCID INTERVAL,of consul-general for India.  But this Protector of the Poor proved a
1303,A LUCID INTERVAL,"broken reed.  He told Ram Singh flatly that he was a belated feudalist,"
1304,A LUCID INTERVAL,"which was true; and implied that he was a land-grabber, which was not"
1305,A LUCID INTERVAL,"true, Ram Singh having only enjoyed the fruits of his fore-bears'"
1306,A LUCID INTERVAL,"enterprise.  Deeply incensed, the appellant shook the dust of"
1307,A LUCID INTERVAL,"Caerlaverock House from his feet, and sat down to plan a revenge upon"
1308,A LUCID INTERVAL,the Government which had wronged him.  And in his wrath he thought of
1309,A LUCID INTERVAL,"the heirloom of his house, the drug which could change men's souls."
1310,A LUCID INTERVAL,
1311,A LUCID INTERVAL,It happened that Lord Caerlaverock cook's came from the same
1312,A LUCID INTERVAL,"neighbourhood as Ram Singh.  This cook, Lal Muhammad by name, was one"
1313,A LUCID INTERVAL,"of a large poor family, hangers-on of Ram Singh's house.  The aggrieved"
1314,A LUCID INTERVAL,"landowner summoned him, and demanded as of right his humble services."
1315,A LUCID INTERVAL,"Lal Muhammad, who found his berth to his liking, hesitated, quibbled,"
1316,A LUCID INTERVAL,"but was finally overborne.  He suggested a fee for his services, but"
1317,A LUCID INTERVAL,hastily withdrew when Ram Singh sketched a few of the steps he proposed
1318,A LUCID INTERVAL,to take on his return by way of punishing Lal Muhammad's insolence on
1319,A LUCID INTERVAL,Lal Muhammad's household.  Then he got to business.  There was a great
1320,A LUCID INTERVAL,"dinner next week--so he had learned from Jephson, the butler--and more"
1321,A LUCID INTERVAL,than one member of the Government would honour Caerlaverock House by
1322,A LUCID INTERVAL,his presence.  With deference he suggested this as a fitting occasion
1323,A LUCID INTERVAL,"for the experiment, and Ram Singh was pleased to assent."
1324,A LUCID INTERVAL,
1325,A LUCID INTERVAL,I can picture these two holding their meetings in the South Kensington
1326,A LUCID INTERVAL,"lodgings where Ram Singh dwelt.  We know from James, the second"
1327,A LUCID INTERVAL,"footman, that they met also at Caerlaverock House, no doubt that Ram"
1328,A LUCID INTERVAL,Singh might make certain that his orders were duly obeyed.  I can see
1329,A LUCID INTERVAL,the little packet of clear grains--I picture them like small granulated
1330,A LUCID INTERVAL,"sugar--added to the condiments, and soon dissolved out of sight.  The"
1331,A LUCID INTERVAL,deed was done; the cook returned to Bloomsbury and Ram Singh to
1332,A LUCID INTERVAL,"Gloucester Road, to await with the patient certainty of the East the"
1333,A LUCID INTERVAL,consummation of a great vengeance.

1339,II,"My wife was at Kissengen, and I was dining with the Caerlaverocks en"
1340,II,garcon.  When I have not to wait upon the adornment of the female
1341,II,"person I am a man of punctual habits, and I reached the house as the"
1342,II,"hall clock chimed the quarter-past.  My poor friend, Tommy Deloraine,"
1343,II,"arrived along with me, and we ascended the staircase together.  I call"
1344,II,"him ""my poor friend,"" for at the moment Tommy was under the weather."
1345,II,"He had the misfortune to be a marquis, and a very rich one, and at the"
1346,II,same time to be in love with Claudia Barriton.  Neither circumstance
1347,II,"was in itself an evil, but the combination made for tragedy.  For"
1348,II,"Tommy's twenty-five years of healthy manhood, his cleanly-made"
1349,II,"up-standing figure, his fresh countenance and cheerful laugh, were of"
1350,II,no avail in the lady's eyes when set against the fact that he was an
1351,II,"idle peer.  Miss Claudia was a charming girl, with a notable bee in her"
1352,II,"bonnet.  She was burdened with the cares of the State, and had no"
1353,II,patience with any one who took them lightly.  To her mind the social
1354,II,"fabric was rotten beyond repair, and her purpose was frankly"
1355,II,"destructive.  I remember some of her phrases:  ""A bold and generous"
1356,II,"policy of social amelioration""; ""The development of a civic"
1357,II,"conscience""; ""A strong hand to lop off decaying branches from the trunk"
1358,II,"of the State.""  I have no fault to find with her creed, but I objected"
1359,II,to its practical working when it took the shape of an inhuman hostility
1360,II,"to that devout lover, Tommy Deloraine.  She had refused him, I believe,"
1361,II,"three times, with every circumstance of scorn.  The first time she had"
1362,II,"analysed his character, and described him as a bundle of attractive"
1363,II,"weaknesses.  ""The only forces I recognise are those of intellect and"
1364,II,"conscience,"" she had said, ""and you have neither."" The second time--it"
1365,II,was after he had been to Canada on the staff--she spoke of the
1366,II,"irreconcilability of their political ideals.  ""You are an Imperialist,"""
1367,II,"she said, ""and believe in an empire of conquest for the benefit of the"
1368,II,"few.  I want a little island with a rich life for all.""  Tommy declared"
1369,II,"that he would become a Doukhobor to please her, but she said something"
1370,II,about the inability of Ethiopians to change their skin.  The third time
1371,II,"she hinted vaguely that there was ""another.""  The star of Abinger"
1372,II,"Vennard was now blazing in the firmament, and she had conceived a"
1373,II,"platonic admiration for him.  The truth is that Miss Claudia, with all"
1374,II,"her cleverness, was very young and--dare I say it?--rather silly."
1375,II,
1376,II,"Caerlaverock was stroking his beard, his legs astraddle on the"
1377,II,"hearthrug, with something appallingly viceregal in his air, when Mr."
1378,II,and Mrs. Alexander Cargill were announced.  The Home Secretary was a
1379,II,"joy to behold.  He had the face of an elderly and pious bookmaker, and"
1380,II,"a voice in which lurked the indescribable Scotch quality of ""unction."""
1381,II,When he was talking you had only to shut your eyes to imagine yourself
1382,II,in some lowland kirk on a hot Sabbath morning.  He had been a
1383,II,"distinguished advocate before he left the law for politics, and had"
1384,II,swayed juries of his countrymen at his will.  The man was
1385,II,extraordinarily efficient on a platform.  There were unplumbed depths
1386,II,"of emotion in his eye, a juicy sentiment in his voice, an overpowering"
1387,II,"tenderness in his manner, which gave to politics the glamour of a"
1388,II,"revival meeting.  He wallowed in obvious pathos, and his hearers, often"
1389,II,"unwillingly, wallowed with him.  I have never listened to any orator at"
1390,II,once so offensive and so horribly effective.  There was no appeal too
1391,II,"base for him, and none too august:  by some subtle alchemy he blended"
1392,II,the arts of the prophet and the fishwife.  He had discovered a new kind
1393,II,"of language.  Instead of ""the hungry millions,"" or ""the toilers,"" or"
1394,II,"any of the numerous synonyms for our masters, he invented the phrase,"
1395,II,"""Goad's people.""  ""I shall never rest,"" so ran his great declaration,"
1396,II,"""till Goad's green fields and Goad's clear waters are free to Goad's"
1397,II,"people.""  I remember how on this occasion he pressed my hand with his"
1398,II,"famous cordiality, looked gravely and earnestly into my face, and then"
1399,II,gazed sternly into vacancy.  It was a fine picture of genius descending
1400,II,for a moment from its hill-top to show how close it was to poor
1401,II,humanity.
1402,II,
1403,II,"Then came Lord Mulross, a respectable troglodytic peer, who represented"
1404,II,the one sluggish element in a swiftly progressing Government.  He was
1405,II,an oldish man with bushy whiskers and a reputed mastery of the French
1406,II,"tongue.  A Whig, who had never changed his creed one iota, he was"
1407,II,highly valued by the country as a sober element in the nation's
1408,II,"councils, and endured by the Cabinet as necessary ballast.  He did not"
1409,II,"conceal his dislike for certain of his colleagues, notably Mr. Vennard"
1410,II,and Mr. Cargill.
1411,II,
1412,II,When Miss Barriton arrived with her stepmother the party was almost
1413,II,complete.  She entered with an air of apologising for her prettiness.
1414,II,"Her manner with old men was delightful, and I watched with interest the"
1415,II,unbending of Caerlaverock and the simplifying of Mr. Cargill in her
1416,II,"presence.  Deloraine, who was talking feverishly to Mrs. Cargill,"
1417,II,"started as if to go and greet her, thought better of it, and continued"
1418,II,"his conversation.  The lady swept the room with her eye, but did not"
1419,II,acknowledge his presence.  She floated off with Mr. Cargill to a
1420,II,"window-corner, and metaphorically sat at his feet.  I saw Deloraine"
1421,II,"saying things behind his moustache, while he listened to Mrs. Cargill's"
1422,II,new cure for dyspepsia.
1423,II,
1424,II,"Last of all, twenty minutes late, came Abinger Vennard.  He made a fine"
1425,II,"stage entrance, walking swiftly with a lowering brow to his hostess,"
1426,II,and then glaring fiercely round the room as if to challenge criticism.
1427,II,"I have heard Deloraine, in a moment of irritation, describe him as a"
1428,II,"""Pre-Raphaelite attorney,""  but there could be no denying his good"
1429,II,"looks.  He had a bad, loose figure, and a quantity of studiously"
1430,II,"neglected hair, but his face was the face of a young Greek.  A certain"
1431,II,"kind of political success gives a man the manners of an actor, and both"
1432,II,Vennard and Cargill bristled with self-consciousness.  You could see it
1433,II,"in the way they patted their hair, squared their shoulders, and shifted"
1434,II,their feet to positions loved by sculptors.
1435,II,
1436,II,"""Well, Vennard, what's the news from the House?"" Caerlaverock asked."
1437,II,
1438,II,"""Simpson is talking,"" said Vennard wearily.  ""He attacks me, of course."
1439,II,He says he has lived forty years in India--as if that mattered!  When
1440,II,will people recognise that the truths of democratic policy are
1441,II,"independent of time and space?  Liberalism is a category, an eternal"
1442,II,"mode of thought, which cannot be overthrown by any trivial happenings."
1443,II,"I am sick of the word 'facts.'  I long for truths."""
1444,II,
1445,II,"Miss Barriton's eyes brightened, and Cargill said, ""Excellent."" Lord"
1446,II,"Mulross, who was a little deaf, and in any case did not understand the"
1447,II,"language, said loudly to my aunt that he wished there was a close time"
1448,II,for legislation.
1449,II,
1450,II,"""The open season for grouse should be the close season for politicians."""
1451,II,
1452,II,And then we went down to dinner.
1453,II,
1454,II,"Miss Barriton sat on my left hand, between Deloraine and me, and it was"
1455,II,clear she was discontented with her position.  Her eyes wandered down
1456,II,"the table to Vennard, who had taken in an American duchess, and seemed"
1457,II,"to be amused at her prattle.  She looked with disfavour at Deloraine,"
1458,II,and turned to me as the lesser of two evils.
1459,II,
1460,II,I was tactless enough to say that I thought there was a good deal in
1461,II,"Lord Mulross's view.  ""Oh, how can you?""  she cried.  ""Is there a close"
1462,II,season for the wants of the people?  It sounds to me perfectly horrible
1463,II,"the way you talk of government, as if it were a game for idle men of"
1464,II,"the upper classes.  I want professional politicians, men who give their"
1465,II,whole heart and soul to the service of the State.  I know the kind of
1466,II,member you and Lord Deloraine like--a rich young man who eats and
1467,II,"drinks too much, and thinks the real business of life is killing little"
1468,II,"birds.  He travels abroad and shoots some big game, and then comes home"
1469,II,"and vapours about the Empire.  He knows nothing about realities, and"
1470,II,"will go down before the men who take the world seriously."""
1471,II,
1472,II,"I am afraid I laughed, but Deloraine, who had been listening, was in no"
1473,II,mood to be amused.
1474,II,
1475,II,"""I don't think you are quite fair to us, Miss Claudia,"" he said slowly."
1476,II,"""We take things seriously enough, the things we know about.  We can't"
1477,II,"be expected to know about everything, and the misfortune is that the"
1478,II,things I care about don't interest you.  But they are important enough
1479,II,"for all that."""
1480,II,
1481,II,"""Hush,"" said the lady rudely.  ""I want to hear what Mr. Vennard is"
1482,II,"saying."""
1483,II,
1484,II,Mr. Vennard was addressing the dinner-table as if it were a large
1485,II,"public meeting.  It was a habit he had, for he had no mind to confine"
1486,II,the pearls of his wisdom to his immediate neighbours.  His words were
1487,II,directed to Caerlaverock at the far end.
1488,II,
1489,II,"""In my opinion this craze for the scientific stand-point is not merely"
1490,II,overdone--it is radically vicious.  Human destinies cannot be treated
1491,II,as if they were inert objects under the microscope.  The cold-blooded
1492,II,logical way of treating a problem is in almost every case the wrong
1493,II,way.  Heart and imagination to me are more vital than intellect.  I
1494,II,"have the courage to be illogical, to defy facts for the sake of an"
1495,II,"ideal, in the certainty that in time facts will fall into conformity."
1496,II,My Creed may be put in the words of Newman's favourite quotation:  Non
1497,II,in dialectica complacuit Deo salvum facere populum suum--Not in cold
1498,II,"logic is it God's will that His people should find salvation."""
1499,II,
1500,II,"""It is profoundly true,"" sighed Mr. Cargill, and Miss Claudia's beaming"
1501,II,"eyes proved her assent.  The moment of destiny, though I did not know"
1502,II,"it, had arrived.  The entree course had begun, and of the two entrees"
1503,II,one was the famous Caerlaverock curry.  Now on a hot July evening in
1504,II,"London there are more attractive foods than curry seven times heated,"
1505,II,"MORE INDICO.  I doubt if any guest would have touched it, had not our"
1506,II,host in his viceregal voice called the attention of the three ministers
1507,II,"to its merits, while explaining that under doctor's orders he was"
1508,II,"compelled to refrain for a season.  The result was that Mulross,"
1509,II,"Cargill, and Vennard alone of the men partook of it.  Miss Claudia,"
1510,II,"alone of the women, followed suit in the fervour of her hero-worship."
1511,II,"She ate a mouthful, and then drank rapidly two glasses of water."
1512,II,
1513,II,My narrative of the events which followed is based rather on what I
1514,II,"should have seen than on what I saw.  I had not the key, and missed"
1515,II,"much which otherwise would have been plain to me.  For example, if I"
1516,II,"had known the secret, I must have seen Miss Claudia's gaze cease to"
1517,II,rest upon Vennard and the adoration die out of her eyes.  I must have
1518,II,"noticed her face soften to the unhappy Deloraine.  As it was, I did not"
1519,II,"remark her behaviour, till I heard her say to her neighbour--"
1520,II,
1521,II,"""Can't you get hold of Mr. Vennard and forcibly cut his hair?"""
1522,II,
1523,II,Deloraine looked round with a start.  Miss Barriton's tone was intimate
1524,II,and her face friendly.
1525,II,
1526,II,"""Some people think it picturesque,"" he said in serious bewilderment."
1527,II,
1528,II,"""Oh, yes, picturesque--like a hair-dresser's young man!"" she shrugged"
1529,II,"her shoulders.  ""He looks as if he had never been out of doors in his"
1530,II,"life."""
1531,II,
1532,II,"Now, whatever the faults of Tommy's appearance, he had a wholesome"
1533,II,"sunburnt face, and he knew it.  This speech of Miss Barriton's cheered"
1534,II,"him enormously, for he argued that if she had fallen out of love with"
1535,II,Vennard's looks she might fall in love with his own.  Being a
1536,II,"philosopher in his way, he was content to take what the gods gave, and"
1537,II,ask for no explanations.
1538,II,
1539,II,"I do not know how their conversation prospered, for my attention was"
1540,II,distracted by the extraordinary behaviour of the Home Secretary.  Mr.
1541,II,"Cargill had made himself notorious by his treatment of ""political"""
1542,II,prisoners.  It was sufficient in his eyes for a criminal to confess to
1543,II,political convictions to secure the most lenient treatment and a speedy
1544,II,release.  The Irish patriot who cracked skulls in the Scotland Division
1545,II,"of Liverpool, the Suffragist who broke windows and the noses of the"
1546,II,"police, the Social Democrat whose antipathy to the Tsar revealed itself"
1547,II,"in assaults upon the Russian Embassy, the ""hunger-marchers"" who had"
1548,II,"designs on the British Museum,--all were sure of respectful and tender"
1549,II,"handling.  He had announced more than once, amid tumultuous cheering,"
1550,II,"that he would never be the means of branding earnestness, however"
1551,II,"mistaken, with the badge of the felon."
1552,II,
1553,II,"He was talking I recall, to Lady Lavinia Dobson, renowned in two"
1554,II,hemispheres for her advocacy of women's rights.  And this was what I
1555,II,"heard him say.  His face had grown suddenly flushed and his eye bright,"
1556,II,so that he looked liker than ever to a bookmaker who had had a good
1557,II,"meeting.  ""No, no, my dear lady, I have been a lawyer, and it is my"
1558,II,"duty in office to see that the law, the palladium of British liberties"
1559,II,"is kept sacrosanct.  The law is no respecter of persons, and I intend"
1560,II,that it shall be no respecter of creeds.  If men or women break the
1561,II,"laws, to jail they shall go, though their intentions were those of the"
1562,II,Apostle Paul.  We don't punish them for being Socialists or
1563,II,"Suffragists, but for breaking the peace.  Why, goodness me, if we"
1564,II,"didn't, we should have every malefactor in Britain claiming"
1565,II,preferential treatment because he was a Christian Scientist or a
1566,II,"Pentecostal Dancer."""
1567,II,
1568,II,"""Mr. Cargill, do you realise what you are saying?"" said Lady Lavinia"
1569,II,with a scared face.
1570,II,
1571,II,"""Of course I do.  I am a lawyer, and may be presumed to know the law."
1572,II,"If any other doctrine were admitted, the Empire would burst up in a"
1573,II,"fortnight."""
1574,II,
1575,II,"""That I should live to hear you name that accursed name!"" cried the"
1576,II,"outraged lady.  ""You are denying your gods, Mr. Cargill.  You are"
1577,II,"forgetting the principles of a lifetime."""
1578,II,
1579,II,"Mr. Cargill was becoming excited, and exchanging his ordinary"
1580,II,Edinburgh-English for a broader and more effective dialect.
1581,II,
1582,II,"""Tut, tut, my good wumman, I may be allowed to know my own principles"
1583,II,best.  I tell ye I've always maintained these views from the day when I
1584,II,"first walked the floor of the Parliament House.  Besides, even if I"
1585,II,"hadn't, I'm surely at liberty to change if I get more light.  Whoever"
1586,II,makes a fetish of consistency is a trumpery body and little use to God
1587,II,"or man.  What ails ye at the Empire, too?  Is it not better to have a"
1588,II,"big country than a kailyard, or a house in Grosvenor Square than a"
1589,II,"but-and-ben in Balham?"""
1590,II,
1591,II,"Lady Lavinia folded her hands.  ""We slaughter our black"
1592,II,"fellow-citizens, we fill South Africa with yellow slaves, we crowd the"
1593,II,Indian prisons with the noblest and most enlightened of the Indian
1594,II,"race, and we call it Empire building!"""
1595,II,
1596,II,"""No, we don't,"" said Mr. Cargill stoutly, ""we call it common-sense."
1597,II,That is the penal and repressive side of any great activity.  D'ye mean
1598,II,to tell me that you never give your maid a good hearing?  But would you
1599,II,like it to be said that you spent the whole of your days swearing at
1600,II,"the wumman?"""
1601,II,
1602,II,"""I never swore in my life,"" said Lady Lavinia."
1603,II,
1604,II,"""I spoke metaphorically,"" said Mr. Cargill.  ""If ye cannot understand a"
1605,II,"simple metaphor, ye cannot understand the rudiments of politics."""
1606,II,
1607,II,Picture to yourself a prophet who suddenly discovers that his God is
1608,II,"laughing at him, a devotee whose saint winks and tells him that the"
1609,II,"devotion of years has been a farce, and you will get some idea of Lady"
1610,II,"Lavinia's frame of mind.  Her sallow face flushed, her lip trembled,"
1611,II,and she slewed round as far as her chair would permit her.  Meanwhile
1612,II,"Mr. Cargill, redder than before, went on contentedly with his dinner."
1613,II,
1614,II,I was glad when my aunt gave the signal to rise.  The atmosphere was
1615,II,"electric, and all were conscious of it save the three Ministers,"
1616,II,"Deloraine, and Miss Claudia.  Vennard seemed to be behaving very badly."
1617,II,"He was arguing with Caerlaverock down the table, and the ex-Viceroy's"
1618,II,"face was slowly getting purple.  When the ladies had gone, we remained"
1619,II,"oblivious to wine and cigarettes, listening to this heated controversy"
1620,II,which threatened any minute to end in a quarrel.
1621,II,
1622,II,"The subject was India, and Vennard was discussing on the follies of all"
1623,II,Viceroys.
1624,II,
1625,II,"""Take this idiot we've got now,"" he declared.  ""He expects me to be a"
1626,II,sort of wet-nurse to the Government of India and do all their dirty
1627,II,"work for them.  They know local conditions, and they have ample powers"
1628,II,"if they would only use them, but they won't take an atom of"
1629,II,"responsibility.  How the deuce am I to decide for them, when in the"
1630,II,"nature of things I can't be half as well informed about the facts!"""
1631,II,
1632,II,"""Do you maintain,"" said Caerlaverock, stuttering in his wrath, ""that"
1633,II,the British Government should divest itself of responsibility for the
1634,II,"governement of our great Indian Dependency?"""
1635,II,
1636,II,"""Not a bit,"" said Vennard impatiently; ""of course we are responsible,"
1637,II,but that is all the more reason why the fellows who know the business
1638,II,at first hand should do their duty.  If I am the head of a bank I am
1639,II,"responsible for its policy, but that doesn't mean that every local"
1640,II,bank-manager should consult me about the solvency of clients I never
1641,II,heard of.  Faversham keeps bleating to me that the state of India is
1642,II,"dangerous.  Well, for God's sake let him suppress every native paper,"
1643,II,"shut up the schools, and send every agitator to the Andamans.  I'll"
1644,II,"back him up all right.  But don't let him ask me what to do, for I"
1645,II,"don't know."""
1646,II,
1647,II,"""You think such a course would be popular?"" asked a large, grave man, a"
1648,II,newspaper editor.
1649,II,
1650,II,"""Of course it would,"" said Vennard cheerily.  ""The British public hates"
1651,II,the idea of letting India get out of hand.  But they want a lead.  They
1652,II,"can't be expected to start the show any more than I can."""
1653,II,
1654,II,Lord Caerlaverock rose to join the ladies with an air of outraged
1655,II,dignity.  Vennard pulled out his watch and announced that he must go
1656,II,back to the House.
1657,II,
1658,II,"""Do you know what I am going to do?"" he asked.  ""I am going down to"
1659,II,tell Simpson what I think of him.  He gets up and prates of having been
1660,II,"forty years in India.  Well, I am going to tell him that it is to him"
1661,II,"and his forty-year lot that all this muddle is due.  Oh, I assure you,"
1662,II,"there's going to be a row,"" said Vennard, as he struggled into his coat."
1663,II,
1664,II,"Mulross had been sitting next me, and I asked him if he was leaving"
1665,II,"town.  ""I wish I could,"" he said, ""but I fear I must stick on over the"
1666,II,Twelth.  I don't like the way that fellow Von Kladow has been talking.
1667,II,"He's up to no good, and he's going to get a flea in his ear before he"
1668,II,"is very much older."""
1669,II,
1670,II,"Cheerfully, almost hilariously the three Ministers departed, Vennard"
1671,II,and Cargill in a hansom and Mulross on foot.  I can only describe the
1672,II,condition of those left behind as nervous prostration.  We looked
1673,II,"furtively at each other, each afraid to hint his suspicions, but all"
1674,II,convinced that a surprising judgment had befallen at least two members
1675,II,"of his Majesty's Government.  For myself I put the number at three, for"
1676,II,I did not like to hear a respected Whig Foreign Secretary talk about
1677,II,giving the Chancellor of a friendly but jealous Power a flea in his ear.
1678,II,
1679,II,The only unperplexed face was Deloraine's.  He whispered to me that
1680,II,"Miss Barriton was going on to the Alvanleys' ball, and had warned him"
1681,II,"to be there.  ""She hasn't been to a dance for months, you know,"" he"
1682,II,"said.  ""I really think things are beginning to go a little better, old"
1683,II,"man."""
1684,II,
1685,II,
1686,II,
1687,III,III
1688,III,
1689,III,When I opened my paper next morning I read two startling pieces of
1690,III,news.  Lord Mulross had been knocked down by a taxi-cab on his way home
1691,III,"the night before, and was now in bed suffering from a bad shock and a"
1692,III,"bruised ankle.  There was no cause for anxiety, said the report, but"
1693,III,his lordship must keep his room for a week or two.
1694,III,
1695,III,"The second item, which filled leading articles and overflowed into"
1696,III,"""Political Notes,"" was Mr. Vennard's speech.  The Secretary for India"
1697,III,"had gone down about eleven o'clock to the House, where an Indian debate"
1698,III,was dragging out its slow length.  He sat himself on the Treasury Bench
1699,III,"and took notes, and the House soon filled in anticipation of his reply."
1700,III,"His ""tail""--progressive young men like himself--were there in full"
1701,III,"strength, ready to cheer every syllable which fell from their idol."
1702,III,"Somewhere about half-past twelve he rose to wind up the debate, and the"
1703,III,House was treated to an unparalleled sensation.  He began with his
1704,III,"critics, notably the unfortunate Simpson, and, pretty much in"
1705,III,"Westbury's language to the herald, called them silly old men who did"
1706,III,not understand their silly old business.  But it was the reasons he
1707,III,gave for this abuse which left his followers aghast.  He attacked his
1708,III,"critics not for being satraps and reactionaries, but because they had"
1709,III,dared to talk second-rate Western politics in connection with India.
1710,III,
1711,III,"""Have you lived for forty years with your eyes shut,"" he cried, ""that"
1712,III,"you cannot see the difference between a Bengali, married at fifteen and"
1713,III,"worshipping a pantheon of savage gods, and the university-extension"
1714,III,"Young Radical at home?  There is a thousand years between them, and you"
1715,III,dream of annihilating the centuries with a little dubious popular
1716,III,"science!""  Then he turned to the other critics of Indian"
1717,III,administration--his quondam supporters.  He analysed the character of
1718,III,"these ""members for India"" with a vigour and acumen which deprived them"
1719,III,"of speech.  The East, he said, had had its revenge upon the West by"
1720,III,making certain Englishmen babus.  His honourable friends had the same
1721,III,"slipshod minds, and they talked the same pigeon-English, as the"
1722,III,"patriots of Bengal.  Then his mood changed, and he delivered a solemn"
1723,III,"warning against what he called ""the treason begotten of restless vanity"
1724,III,"and proved incompetence.""  He sat down, leaving a House deeply"
1725,III,impressed and horribly mystified.
1726,III,
1727,III,The Times did not know what to make of it at all.  In a weighty leader
1728,III,"it welcomed Mr. Vennard's conversion, but hinted that with a convert's"
1729,III,zeal he had slightly overstated his case.  The Daily Chronicle talked
1730,III,"of ""nervous breakdown,""  and suggested ""kindly forgetfulness"" as the"
1731,III,"best treatment.  The Daily News, in a spirited article called ""The"
1732,III,"Great Betrayal,"" washed its hands of Mr. Vennard unless he donned the"
1733,III,white sheet of the penitent.  Later in the day I got The Westminster
1734,III,"Gazette, and found an ingenious leader which proved that the speech in"
1735,III,"no way conflicted with Liberal principles, and was capable of a quite"
1736,III,ordinary explanation.  Then I went to see Lady Caerlaverock.
1737,III,
1738,III,I found my aunt almost in tears.
1739,III,
1740,III,"""What has happened?"" she cried.  ""What have we done that we should be"
1741,III,punished in this awful way?  And to think that the blow fell in this
1742,III,"house? Caerlaverock--we all--thought Mr. Vennard so strange last night,"
1743,III,and Lady Lavinia told me that Mr. Cargill was perfectly horrible.  I
1744,III,suppose it must be the heat and the strain of the session.  And that
1745,III,"poor Lord Mulross, who was always so wise, should be stricken down at"
1746,III,"this crisis!"""
1747,III,
1748,III,I did not say that I thought Mulross's accident a merciful
1749,III,"dispensation.  I was far more afraid of him than of all the others, for"
1750,III,"if with his reputation for sanity he chose to run amok, he would be"
1751,III,taken seriously.  He was better in bed than affixing a flea to Von
1752,III,Kladow's ear.
1753,III,
1754,III,"""Caerlaverock was with the Prime Minister this morning,"" my aunt went"
1755,III,"on.  ""He is going to make a statement in the Lords tomorrow to try to"
1756,III,cover Mr. Vennard's folly.  They are very anxious about what Mr.
1757,III,Cargill will do today.  He is addressing the National Convention of
1758,III,"Young Liberals at Oldham this afternoon, and though they have sent him"
1759,III,a dozen telegrams they can get no answer.  Caerlaverock went to Downing
1760,III,"Street an hour ago to get news."""
1761,III,
1762,III,There was the sound of an electric brougham stopping in the square
1763,III,"below, and we both listened with a premonition of disaster.  A minute"
1764,III,"later Caerlaverock entered the room, and with him the Prime Minister."
1765,III,"The cheerful, eupeptic countenance of the latter was clouded with care."
1766,III,"He shook hands dismally with my aunt, nodded to me, and flung himself"
1767,III,down on a sofa.
1768,III,
1769,III,"""The worst has happened,"" Caerlaverock boomed solemnly.  ""Cargill has"
1770,III,"been incredibly and infamously silly.""  He tossed me an evening paper."
1771,III,
1772,III,One glance convinced me that the Convention of Young Liberals had had a
1773,III,waking-up.  Cargill had addressed them on what he called the true view
1774,III,of citizenship.  He had dismissed manhood suffrage as an obsolete
1775,III,"folly.  The franchise, he maintained, should be narrowed and given only"
1776,III,"to citizens, and his definition of citizenship was military training"
1777,III,combined with a fairly high standard of rates and taxes.  I do not know

1781,III,"""We must disavow him,"" said Caerlaverock."
1782,III,
1783,III,"""He is too valuable a man to lose,"" said the Prime Minister.  ""We must"
1784,III,hope that it is only a temporary aberration.  I simply cannot spare him
1785,III,"in the House."""
1786,III,
1787,III,"""But this is flat treason."""
1788,III,
1789,III,"""I know, I know.  It is all too horrible, and utterly unexpected.  But"
1790,III,"the situation wants delicate handling, my dear Caerlaverock.  I see"
1791,III,"nothing for it but to give out that he was ill."""
1792,III,
1793,III,"""Or drunk?""  I suggested."
1794,III,
1795,III,"The Prime Minister shook his head sadly.  ""I fear it will be the same"
1796,III,thing.  What we call illness the ordinary man will interpret as
1797,III,"intoxication.  It is a most regrettable necessity, but we must face it."""
1798,III,
1799,III,"The harassed leader rose, seized the evening paper, and departed as"
1800,III,"swiftly as he had come.  ""Remember, illness,"" were his parting words."
1801,III,"""An old heart trouble, which is apt to affect his brain.  His friends"
1802,III,"have always known about it."""
1803,III,
1804,III,"I walked home, and looked in at the Club on my way.  There I found"
1805,III,Deloraine devouring a hearty tea and looking the picture of virtuous
1806,III,happiness.
1807,III,
1808,III,"""Well, this is tremendous news,""  I said, as I sat down beside him."
1809,III,
1810,III,"""What news?"" he asked with a start."
1811,III,
1812,III,"""This row about Vennard and Cargill."""
1813,III,
1814,III,"""Oh, that!  I haven't seen the papers to-day.  What's it all about?"""
1815,III,His tone was devoid of interest.
1816,III,
1817,III,Then I knew that something of great private moment had happened to
1818,III,Tommy.
1819,III,
1820,III,"""I hope I may congratulate you,""  I said."
1821,III,
1822,III,"Deloraine beamed on me affectionately.  ""Thanks very much, old man."
1823,III,"Things came all right, quite suddenly, you know.  We spent most of the"
1824,III,"time at the Alvanleys together, and this morning in the Park she"
1825,III,"accepted me.  It will be in the papers next week, but we mean to keep"
1826,III,"it quiet for a day or two.  However, it was your right to be told--and,"
1827,III,"besides, you guessed."""
1828,III,
1829,III,"I remember wondering, as I finished my walk home, whether there could"
1830,III,not be some connection between the stroke of Providence which had
1831,III,driven three Cabinet Ministers demented and that gentler touch which
1832,III,had restored Miss Claudia Barriton to good sense and a reasonable
1833,III,marriage.

1838,IV,
1839,IV,The next week was an epoch in my life.  I seemed to live in the centre
1840,IV,"of a Mad Tea-party, where every one was convinced of the madness, and"
1841,IV,yet resolutely protested that nothing had happened.  The public events
1842,IV,of those days were simple enough.  While Lord Mulross's ankle
1843,IV,"approached convalescence, the hives of politics were humming with"
1844,IV,rumours.  Vennard's speech had dissolved his party into its parent
1845,IV,"elements, and the Opposition, as nonplussed as the Government, did not"
1846,IV,dare as yet to claim the recruit.  Consequently he was left alone till
1847,IV,he should see fit to take a further step.  He refused to be
1848,IV,"interviewed, using blasphemous language about our free Press; and"
1849,IV,mercifully he showed no desire to make speeches.  He went down to golf
1850,IV,"at Littlestone, and rarely showed himself in the House.  The earnest"
1851,IV,young reformer seemed to have adopted not only the creed but the habits
1852,IV,of his enemies.
1853,IV,
1854,IV,"Mr. Cargill's was a hard case.  He returned from Oldham, delighted with"
1855,IV,"himself and full of fight, to find awaiting him an urgent message from"
1856,IV,the Prime Minister.  His chief was sympathetic and kindly.  He had long
1857,IV,noticed that the Home Secretary looked fagged and ill.  There was no
1858,IV,"Home Office Bill very pressing, and his assistance in general debate"
1859,IV,could be dispensed with for a little.  Let him take a fortnight's
1860,IV,"holiday--fish, golf, yacht--the Prime Minister was airily suggestive."
1861,IV,In vain Mr. Cargill declared he was perfectly well.  His chief gently
1862,IV,"but firmly overbore him, and insisted on sending him his own doctor."
1863,IV,"That eminent specialist, having been well coached, was vaguely"
1864,IV,"alarming, and insisted on a change.  Then Mr. Cargill began to suspect,"
1865,IV,and asked the Prime Minister point-blank if he objected to his Oldham
1866,IV,"speech.  He was told that there was no objection--a little strong meat,"
1867,IV,"perhaps, for Young Liberals, a little daring, but full of Mr. Cargill's"
1868,IV,"old intellectual power.  Mollified and reassured, the Home Secretary"
1869,IV,"agreed to a week's absence, and departed for a little salmon-fishing in"
1870,IV,"Scotland.  His wife had meantime been taken into the affair, and"
1871,IV,privately assured by the Prime Minister that she would greatly ease the
1872,IV,mind of the Cabinet if she could induce her husband to take a longer
1873,IV,holiday--say three weeks.  She promised to do her best and to keep her
1874,IV,"instructions secret, and the Cargills duly departed for the North.  ""In"
1875,IV,"a fortnight,"" said the Prime Minister to my aunt, ""he will have"
1876,IV,forgotten all this nonsense; but of course we shall have to watch him
1877,IV,"very carefully in the future."""
1878,IV,
1879,IV,"The Press was given its cue, and announced that Mr. Cargill had spoken"
1880,IV,"at Oldham while suffering from severe nervous breakdown, and that the"
1881,IV,remarkable doctrines of that speech need not be taken seriously.  As I
1882,IV,"had expected, the public put its own interpretation upon this tale."
1883,IV,"Men took each other aside in clubs, women gossiped in drawing-rooms,"
1884,IV,and in a week the Cargill scandal had assumed amazing proportions.  The
1885,IV,popular version was that the Home Secretary had got very drunk at
1886,IV,"Caerlaverock House, and still under the influence of liquor had"
1887,IV,addressed the Young Liberals at Oldham.  He was now in an Inebriates'
1888,IV,"Home, and would not return to the House that session.  I confess I"
1889,IV,"trembled when I heard this story, for it was altogether too libellous"
1890,IV,to pass unnoticed.  I believed that soon it would reach the ear of
1891,IV,"Cargill, fishing quietly at Tomandhoul, and that then there would be"
1892,IV,the deuce to pay.
1893,IV,
1894,IV,Nor was I wrong.  A few days later I went to see my aunt to find out
1895,IV,"how the land lay.  She was very bitter, I remember, about Claudia"
1896,IV,"Barriton.  ""I expected sympathy and help from her, and she never comes"
1897,IV,"near me.  I can understand her being absorbed in her engagement, but I"
1898,IV,cannot understand the frivolous way she spoke when I saw her yesterday.
1899,IV,She had the audacity to say that both Mr. Vennard and Mr. Cargill had
1900,IV,"gone up in her estimation.  Young people can be so heartless."""
1901,IV,
1902,IV,"I would have defended Miss Barriton, but at this moment an astonishing"
1903,IV,"figure was announced.  It was Mrs. Cargill in travelling dress, with a"
1904,IV,"purple bonnet and a green motor-veil.  Her face was scarlet, whether"
1905,IV,"from excitement or the winds of Tomandhoul, and she charged down on us"
1906,IV,like a young bull.
1907,IV,
1908,IV,"""We have come back,"" she said, ""to meet our accusers."""
1909,IV,
1910,IV,"""Accusers!"" cried my aunt."
1911,IV,
1912,IV,"""Yes, accusers!"" said the lady.  ""The abominable rumour about Alexander"
1913,IV,"has reached our ears.  At this moment he is with the Prime Minister,"
1914,IV,"demanding an official denial.  I have come to you, because it was here,"
1915,IV,"at your table, that Alexander is said to have fallen."""
1916,IV,
1917,IV,"""I really don't know what you mean, Mrs. Cargill."""
1918,IV,
1919,IV,"""I mean that Alexander is said to have become drunk while dining here,"
1920,IV,"to have been drunk when he spoke at Oldham, and to be now in a"
1921,IV,"Drunkard's Home.""  The poor lady broke down, ""Alexander,"" she cried,"
1922,IV,"""who has been a teetotaller from his youth, and for thirty years an"
1923,IV,elder in the U.P. Church!  No form of intoxicant has ever been
1924,IV,permitted at our table.  Even in illness the thing has never passed our
1925,IV,"lips."""
1926,IV,
1927,IV,"My aunt by this time had pulled herself together.  ""If this outrageous"
1928,IV,"story is current, Mrs. Cargill, there was nothing for it but to come"
1929,IV,back.  Your friends know that it is a gross libel.  The only denial
1930,IV,necessary is for Mr. Cargill to resume his work.  I trust his health is
1931,IV,"better."""
1932,IV,
1933,IV,"""He is well, but heartbroken.  His is a sensitive nature, Lady"
1934,IV,"Caerlaverock, and he feels a stain like a wound."""
1935,IV,
1936,IV,"""There is no stain,"" said my aunt briskly.  ""Every public man is a"
1937,IV,"target for scandals, but no one but a fool believes them.  They will"
1938,IV,die a natural death when he returns to work.  An official denial would
1939,IV,"make everybody look ridiculous, and encourage the ordinary person to"
1940,IV,"think that there may have been something in them.  Believe me, dear"
1941,IV,"Mrs. Cargill, there is nothing to be anxious about now that you are"
1942,IV,"back in London again."""
1943,IV,
1944,IV,"On the contrary, I thought, there was more cause for anxiety than ever."
1945,IV,Cargill was back in the House and the illness game could not be played
1946,IV,a second time.  I went home that night acutely sympathetic towards the
1947,IV,worries of the Prime Minister.  Mulross would be abroad in a day or
1948,IV,"two, and Vennard and Cargill were volcanoes in eruption.  The"
1949,IV,"Government was in a parlous state, with three demented Ministers on the"
1950,IV,loose.
1951,IV,
1952,IV,The same night I first heard the story of The Bill.  Vennard had done
1953,IV,more than play golf at Littlestone.  His active mind--for his bitterest
1954,IV,enemies never denied his intellectual energy--had been busy on a great
1955,IV,"scheme.  At that time, it will be remembered, a serious shrinkage of"
1956,IV,"unskilled labour existed not only in the Transvaal, but in the new"
1957,IV,copper fields of East Africa.  Simultaneously a famine was scourging
1958,IV,"Behar, and Vennard, to do him justice, had made manful efforts to cope"
1959,IV,"with it.  He had gone fully into the question, and had been slowly"
1960,IV,coming to the conclusion that Behar was hopelessly overcrowded.  In his
1961,IV,"new frame of mind--unswervingly logical, utterly unemotional, and"
1962,IV,wholly unbound by tradition--he had come to connect the African and
1963,IV,"Indian troubles, and to see in one the relief of the other.  The first"
1964,IV,fruit of his meditations was a letter to The Times.  In it he laid down
1965,IV,"a new theory of emigration.  The peoples of the Empire, he said, must"
1966,IV,"be mobile, shifting about to suit economic conditions.  But if this was"
1967,IV,"true of the white man, it was equally true for the dark races under our"
1968,IV,tutelage.  He referred to the famine and argued that the recurrence of
1969,IV,"such disasters was inevitable, unless we assisted the poverty-stricken"
1970,IV,ryot to emigrate and sell his labour to advantage.  He proposed
1971,IV,"indentures and terminable contracts, for he declared he had no wish to"
1972,IV,transplant for good.  All that was needed was a short season of
1973,IV,"wage-earning abroad, that the labourer might return home with savings"
1974,IV,which would set him for the future on a higher economic plane. The
1975,IV,"letter was temperate and academic in phrasing, the speculation of a"
1976,IV,"publicist rather than the declaration of a Minister.  But in Liberals,"
1977,IV,"who remembered the pandemonium raised over the Chinese in South Africa,"
1978,IV,it stirred up the gloomiest forebodings.
1979,IV,
1980,IV,"Then, whispered from mouth to mouth, came the news of the Great Bill."
1981,IV,"Vennard, it was said, intended to bring in a measure at the earliest"
1982,IV,possible date to authorise a scheme of enforced and State-aided
1983,IV,emigration to the African mines.  It would apply at first only to the
1984,IV,"famine districts, but power would be given to extend its working by"
1985,IV,"proclamation to other areas.  Such was the rumour, and I need not say"
1986,IV,it was soon magnified.  Questions were asked in the House which the
1987,IV,"Speaker ruled out of order.  Furious articles, inviting denial,"
1988,IV,appeared in the Liberal Press; but Vennard took not the slightest
1989,IV,notice.  He spent his time between his office in Whitehall and the
1990,IV,"links at Littlestone, dropping into the House once or twice for half an"
1991,IV,hour's slumber while a colleague was speaking.  His Under Secretary in
1992,IV,"the Lords--a young gentleman who had joined the party for a bet, and to"
1993,IV,his immense disgust had been immediately rewarded with office--lost his
1994,IV,temper under cross-examination and swore audibly at the Opposition.  In
1995,IV,a day or two the story universally believed was that the Secretary for
1996,IV,India was about to transfer the bulk of the Indian people to work as
1997,IV,indentured labourers for South African Jews.
1998,IV,
1999,IV,"It was this popular version, I fancy, which reached the ears of Ram"
2000,IV,"Singh, and the news came on him like a thunderclap.  He thought that"
2001,IV,what Vennard proposed Vennard could do.  He saw his native province
2002,IV,"stripped of its people, his fields left unploughed, and his cattle"
2003,IV,"untended; nay, it was possible, his own worthy and honourable self sent"
2004,IV,to a far country to dig in a hole.  It was a grievous and intolerable
2005,IV,"prospect.  He walked home to Gloucester Road in heavy preoccupation,"
2006,IV,and the first thing he did was to get out the mysterious brass box in
2007,IV,which he kept his valuables.  From a pocket-book he took a small silk
2008,IV,"packet, opened it, and spilled a few clear grains on his hand.  It was"
2009,IV,the antidote.
2010,IV,
2011,IV,"He waited two days, while on all sides the rumour of the Bill grew"
2012,IV,stronger and its provisions more stringent.  Then he hesitated no
2013,IV,"longer, but sent for Lord Caerlaverock's cook."
2014,IV,
2015,IV,
2016,IV,
2017,V,V
2018,V,
2019,V,"I conceive that the drug did not create new opinions, but elicited"
2020,V,"those which had hitherto lain dormant.  Every man has a creed, but in"
2021,V,"his soul he knows that that creed has another side, possibly not less"
2022,V,"logical, which it does not suit him to produce.  Our most honest"
2023,V,"convictions are not the children of pure reason, but of temperament,"
2024,V,"environment, necessity, and interest.  Most of us take sides in life"
2025,V,"and forget the one we reject.  But our conscience tells us it is there,"
2026,V,and we can on occasion state it with a fairness and fulness which
2027,V,proves that it is not wholly repellent to our reason.  During the
2028,V,"crisis I write of, the attitude of Cargill and Vennard was not that of"
2029,V,roysterers out for irresponsible mischief.  They were eminently
2030,V,"reasonable and wonderfully logical, and in private conversation they"
2031,V,"gave their opponents a very bad time.  Cargill, who had hitherto been"
2032,V,"the hope of the extreme Free-traders, wrote an article for the"
2033,V,"Quarterly on Tariff Reform.  It was set up, but long before it could be"
2034,V,used it was cancelled and the type scattered.  I have seen a proof of
2035,V,"it, however, and I confess I have never read a more brilliant defence"
2036,V,of a doctrine which the author had hitherto described as a childish
2037,V,heresy.  Which proves my contention--that Cargill all along knew that
2038,V,"there was a case against Free Trade, but naturally did not choose to"
2039,V,"admit it, his allegiance being vowed elsewhere.  The drug altered"
2040,V,"temperament, and with it the creed which is based mainly on"
2041,V,"temperament.  It scattered current convictions, roused dormant"
2042,V,"speculations, and without damaging the reason switched it on to a new"
2043,V,track.
2044,V,
2045,V,"I can see all this now, but at the time I saw only stark madness and"
2046,V,the horrible ingenuity of the lunatic.  While Vennard was ruminating on
2047,V,"his Bill, Cargill was going about London arguing like a Scotch"
2048,V,undergraduate.  The Prime Minister had seen from the start that the
2049,V,Home Secretary was the worse danger.  Vennard might talk of his
2050,V,"preposterous Bill, but the Cabinet would have something to say to it"
2051,V,"before its introduction, and he was mercifully disinclined to go near"
2052,V,St. Stephen's.  But Cargill was assiduous in his attendance at the
2053,V,"House, and at any moment might blow the Government sky-high.  His"
2054,V,colleagues were detailed in relays to watch him.  One would hale him to
2055,V,"luncheon, and keep him till question time was over.  Another would"
2056,V,"insist on taking him for a motor ride, which would end in a break-down"
2057,V,"about Brentford.  Invitations to dinner were showered upon him, and"
2058,V,"Cargill, who had been unknown in society, found the whole social"
2059,V,machinery of his party set at work to make him a lion.  The result was
2060,V,"that he was prevented from speaking in public, but given far too much"
2061,V,"encouragement to talk in private.  He talked incessantly, before, at,"
2062,V,"and after dinner, and he did enormous harm.  He was horribly clever,"
2063,V,"too, and usually got the best of an argument, so that various eminent"
2064,V,private Liberals had their tempers ruined by his dialectic.  In his
2065,V,rich and unabashed accent--he had long discarded his
2066,V,Edinburgh-English--he dissected their arguments and ridiculed their
2067,V,character.  He had once been famous for his soapy manners:  now he was
2068,V,as rough as a Highland stot.
2069,V,
2070,V,Things could not go on in this fashion:  the risk was too great.  It
2071,V,"was just a fortnight, I think, after the Caerlaverock dinner-party,"
2072,V,when the Prime Minister resolved to bring matters to a head.  He could
2073,V,not afford to wait for ever on a return of sanity.  He consulted
2074,V,"Caerlaverock, and it was agreed that Vennard and Cargill should be"
2075,V,"asked, or rather commanded to dine on the following evening at"
2076,V,"Caerlaverock House.  Mulross, whose sanity was not suspected, and whose"
2077,V,"ankle was now well again, was also invited, as were three other members"
2078,V,of the Cabinet and myself as amicus curiae.  It was understood that
2079,V,after dinner there would be a settling-up with the two rebels.  Either
2080,V,"they should recant and come to heel, or they should depart from the"
2081,V,fold to swell the wolf-pack of the Opposition.  The Prime Minister did
2082,V,"not conceal the loss which his party would suffer, but he argued very"
2083,V,sensibly that anything was better than a brace of vipers in its bosom.
2084,V,
2085,V,I have never attended a more lugubrious function.  When I arrived I
2086,V,"found Caerlaverock, the Prime Minister, and the three other members of"
2087,V,the Cabinet standing round a small fire in attitudes of nervous
2088,V,"dejection.  I remember it was a raw wet evening, but the gloom out of"
2089,V,doors was sunshine compared to the gloom within.  Caerlaverock's
2090,V,"viceregal air had sadly altered.  The Prime Minister, once famous for"
2091,V,"his genial manners, was pallid and preoccupied.  We exchanged remarks"
2092,V,about the weather and the duration of the session.  Then we fell silent
2093,V,till Mulross arrived.
2094,V,
2095,V,He did not look as if he had come from a sickbed.  He came in as jaunty
2096,V,"as a boy, limping just a little from his accident.  He was greeted by"
2097,V,"his colleagues with tender solicitude,--solicitude, I fear, completely"
2098,V,wasted on him.
2099,V,
2100,V,"""Devilish silly thing to do to get run over,"" he said.  ""I was in a"
2101,V,"brown study when a cab came round a corner.  But I don't regret it, you"
2102,V,know.  During the last fortnight I have had leisure to go into this
2103,V,"Bosnian Succession business, and I see now that Von Kladow has been"
2104,V,playing one big game of bluff.  Very well; it has got to stop.  I am
2105,V,"going to prick the bubble before I am many days older."""
2106,V,
2107,V,"The Prime Minister looked anxious.  ""Our policy towards Bosnia has been"
2108,V,"one of non-interference.  It is not for us, I should have thought, to"
2109,V,"read Germany a lesson."""
2110,V,
2111,V,"""Oh, come now,"" Mulross said, slapping--yes, actually slapping--his"
2112,V,"leader on the back; ""we may drop that nonsense when we are alone.  You"
2113,V,know very well that there are limits to our game of non-interference.
2114,V,"If we don't read Germany a lesson, she will read us one--and a damned"
2115,V,"long unpleasant one too.  The sooner we give up all this milk-blooded,"
2116,V,"blue-spectacled, pacificist talk the better.  However, you will see"
2117,V,"what I have got to say to-morrow in the House."""
2118,V,
2119,V,The Prime Minister's face lengthened.  Mulross was not the pillar he
2120,V,"had thought him, but a splintering reed.  I saw that he agreed with me"
2121,V,that this was the most dangerous of the lot.
2122,V,
2123,V,Then Cargill and Vennard came in together.  Both looking uncommonly
2124,V,"fit, younger, trimmer, cleaner.  Vennard, instead of his sloppy clothes"
2125,V,"and shaggy hair, was groomed like a Guardsman; had a large"
2126,V,"pearl-and-diamond solitaire in his shirt, and a white waistcoat with"
2127,V,"jewelled buttons.  He had lost all his self-consciousness, grinned"
2128,V,"cheerfully at the others, warmed his hands at the fire, and cursed the"
2129,V,"weather.  Cargill, too, had lost his sanctimonious look.  There was a"
2130,V,"bloom of rustic health on his cheek, and a sparkle in his eye, so that"
2131,V,he had the appearance of some rosy Scotch laird of Raeburn's painting.
2132,V,Both men wore an air of purpose and contentment.
2133,V,
2134,V,"Vennard turned at once on the Prime Minister.  ""Did you get my letter?"""
2135,V,"he asked.  ""No?  Well, you'll find it waiting when you get home.  We're"
2136,V,"all friends here, so I can tell you its contents.  We must get rid of"
2137,V,this ridiculous Radical 'tail.' They think they have the whip-hand of
2138,V,"us; well, we have got to prove that we can do very well without them."
2139,V,"They are a collection of confounded, treacherous, complacent prigs, but"
2140,V,"they have no grit in them, and will come to heel if we tackle them"
2141,V,"firmly.  I respect an honest fanatic, but I do not respect those"
2142,V,sentiment-mongers.  They have the impudence to say that the country is
2143,V,with them.  I tell you it is rank nonsense.  If you take a strong hand
2144,V,"with them, you'll double your popularity, and we'll come back  next"
2145,V,"year with an increased majority.  Cargill agrees with me."""
2146,V,
2147,V,"The Prime Minister looked grave.  ""I am not prepared to discuss any"
2148,V,policy of ostracism.  What you call our 'tail' is a vital section of
2149,V,"our party.  Their creed may be one-sided, but it is none the less part"
2150,V,"of our mandate from the people."""
2151,V,
2152,V,"""I want a leader who governs as well as reigns,"" said Vennard. ""I"
2153,V,"believe in discipline, and you know as well as I do that the Rump is"
2154,V,"infernally out of hand."""
2155,V,
2156,V,"""They are not the only members who fail in discipline."""
2157,V,
2158,V,"Vennard grinned.  ""I suppose you mean Cargill and myself.  But we are"
2159,V,"following the central lines of British policy.  We are on your side,"
2160,V,"and we want to make your task easier."""
2161,V,
2162,V,"Cargill suddenly began to laugh.  ""I don't want any ostracism.  Leave"
2163,V,"them alone, and Vennard and I will undertake to give them such a time"
2164,V,in the House that they will wish they had never been born.  We'll make
2165,V,"them resign in batches."""
2166,V,
2167,V,"Dinner was announced, and, laughing uproariously, the two rebels went"
2168,V,arm-in-arm into the dining-room.
2169,V,
2170,V,"Cargill was in tremendous form. He began to tell Scotch stories,"
2171,V,"memories of his old Parliament House days. He told them admirably, with"
2172,V,a raciness of idiom which I had thought beyond him. They were long
2173,V,"tales, and some were as broad as they were long, but Mr. Cargill"
2174,V,"disarmed criticism.  His audience, rather scandalised at the start,"
2175,V,"were soon captured, and political troubles were forgotten in"
2176,V,old-fashioned laughter. Even the Prime Minister's anxious face relaxed.
2177,V,
2178,V,"This lasted till the entree, the famous Caerlaverock curry."
2179,V,
2180,V,"As I have said, I was not in the secret, and did not detect the"
2181,V,transition.  As I partook of the dish I remember feeling a sudden
2182,V,"giddiness and a slight nausea.  The antidote, to those who had not"
2183,V,"taken the drug, must have been, I suppose, in the nature of a mild"
2184,V,"emetic.  A mist seemed to obscure the faces of my fellow-guests, and"
2185,V,"slowly the tide of conversation ebbed away.  First Vennard, then"
2186,V,"Cargill, became silent.  I was feeling rather sick, and I noticed with"
2187,V,some satisfaction that all our faces were a little green. I wondered
2188,V,casually if I had been poisoned.
2189,V,
2190,V,"The sensation passed, but the party had changed. More especially I was"
2191,V,soon conscious that something had happened to the three Ministers.  I
2192,V,"noticed Mulross particularly, for he was my neighbour.  The look of"
2193,V,"keenness and vitality had died out of him, and suddenly he seemed a"
2194,V,"rather old, rather tired man, very weary about the eyes."
2195,V,
2196,V,I asked him if he felt seedy.
2197,V,
2198,V,"""No, not specially,"" he replied, ""but that accident gave me a nasty"
2199,V,"shock."""
2200,V,
2201,V,"""You should go off for a change,""  I said."
2202,V,
2203,V,"""I almost think I will,"" was the answer.  ""I had not meant to leave"
2204,V,town till just before the Twelth but I think I had better get away to
2205,V,"Marienbad for a fortnight.  There is nothing doing in the House, and"
2206,V,"work at the Office is at a standstill.  Yes, I fancy I'll go abroad"
2207,V,"before the end of the week."""
2208,V,
2209,V,I caught the Prime Minister's eye and saw that he had forgotten the
2210,V,"purpose of the dinner, being dimly conscious that that purpose was now"
2211,V,idle.  Cargill and Vennard had ceased to talk like rebels.  The Home
2212,V,"Secretary had subsided into his old, suave, phrasing self.  The humour"
2213,V,"had gone out of his eye, and the looseness had returned to his lips."
2214,V,"He was an older and more commonplace man, but harmless, quite harmless."
2215,V,"Vennard, too, wore a new air, or rather had recaptured his old one. He"
2216,V,"was saying little, but his voice had lost its crispness and recovered"
2217,V,its half-plaintive unction; his shoulders had a droop in them; once
2218,V,more he bristled with self-consciousness.
2219,V,
2220,V,"We others were still shaky from that detestable curry, and were so"
2221,V,"puzzled as to be acutely uncomfortable.  Relief would come later, no"
2222,V,doubt; for the present we were uneasy at this weird transformation.  I
2223,V,"saw the Prime Minister examining the two faces intently, and the result"
2224,V,"seemed to satisfy him.  He sighed and looked at Caerlaverock, who"
2225,V,smiled and nodded.
2226,V,
2227,V,"""What about that Bill of yours, Vennard?"" he asked.  ""There have been a"
2228,V,"lot of stupid rumours."""
2229,V,
2230,V,"""Bill?""  Vennard said.  ""I know of no Bill.  Now that my departmental"
2231,V,"work is over, I can give my whole soul to Cargill's Small Holdings.  Do"
2232,V,"you mean that?"""
2233,V,
2234,V,"""Yes, of course.  There was some confusion in the popular mind, but the"
2235,V,old arrangement holds.  You and Cargill will put it through between
2236,V,"you."""
2237,V,
2238,V,"They began to talk about those weariful small holdings, and I ceased to"
2239,V,"listen.  We left the dining-room and drifted to the library, where a"
2240,V,fire tried to dispel the gloom of the weather.  There was a feeling of
2241,V,"deadly depression abroad, so that, for all its awkwardness, I would"
2242,V,really have preferred the former Caerlaverock dinner.  The Prime
2243,V,Minister was whispering to his host.  I heard him say something about
2244,V,"there being ""the devil of a lot of explaining"" before him."
2245,V,
2246,V,"Vennard and Cargill came last to the library, arm-in-arm as before."
2247,V,
2248,V,"""I should count it a greater honour,"" Vennard was saying, ""to sweeten"
2249,V,the lot of one toiler in England than to add a million miles to our
2250,V,territory.  While one English household falls below the minimum scale
2251,V,"of civic wellbeing, all talk of Empire is sin and folly."" ""Excellent!"""
2252,V,said Mr. Cargill.  Then I knew for certain that at last peace had
2253,V,descended upon the vexed tents of Israel.

2310,THE LEMNIAN,
2311,THE LEMNIAN,He pushed the matted locks from his brow as he peered into the mist.
2312,THE LEMNIAN,"His hair was thick with salt, and his eyes smarted from the greenwood"
2313,THE LEMNIAN,fire on the poop.  The four slaves who crouched beside the
2314,THE LEMNIAN,"thwarts-Carians with thin birdlike faces-were in a pitiable case, their"
2315,THE LEMNIAN,hands blue with oar-weals and the lash marks on their shoulders
2316,THE LEMNIAN,beginning to gape from sun and sea.  The Lemnian himself bore marks of
2317,THE LEMNIAN,"ill usage.  His cloak was still sopping, his eyes heavy with watching,"
2318,THE LEMNIAN,and his lips black and cracked with thirst.  Two days before the storm
2319,THE LEMNIAN,had caught him and swept his little craft into mid-Aegean.  He was a
2320,THE LEMNIAN,"sailor, come of sailor stock, and he had fought the gale manfully and"
2321,THE LEMNIAN,"well.  But the sea had burst his waterjars, and the torments of drought"
2322,THE LEMNIAN,"had been added to his toil.  He had been driven south almost to Scyros,"
2323,THE LEMNIAN,but had found no harbour.  Then a weary day with the oars had brought
2324,THE LEMNIAN,"him close to the Euboean shore, when a freshet of storm drove him"
2325,THE LEMNIAN,seaward again.  Now at last in this northerly creek of Sciathos he had
2326,THE LEMNIAN,"found shelter and a spring.  But it was a perilous place, for there"
2327,THE LEMNIAN,were robbers in the bushy hills--mainland men who loved above all things
2328,THE LEMNIAN,"to rob an islander: and out at sea, as he looked towards Pelion, there"
2329,THE LEMNIAN,seemed something adoing which boded little good.  There was deep water
2330,THE LEMNIAN,"beneath a ledge of cliff, half covered by a tangle of wildwood.  So"
2331,THE LEMNIAN,"Atta lay in the bows, looking through the trails of vine at the racing"
2332,THE LEMNIAN,tides now reddening in the dawn.
2333,THE LEMNIAN,
2334,THE LEMNIAN,The storm had hit others besides him it seemed.  The channel was full
2335,THE LEMNIAN,"of ships, aimless ships that tossed between tide and wind.  Looking"
2336,THE LEMNIAN,"closer, he saw that they were all wreckage.  There had been tremendous"
2337,THE LEMNIAN,"doings in the north, and a navy of some sort had come to grief.  Atta"
2338,THE LEMNIAN,"was a prudent man, and knew that a broken fleet might be dangerous."
2339,THE LEMNIAN,There might be men lurking in the maimed galleys who would make short
2340,THE LEMNIAN,work of the owner of a battered but navigable craft.  At first he
2341,THE LEMNIAN,thought that the ships were those of the Hellenes.  The troublesome
2342,THE LEMNIAN,"fellows were everywhere in the islands, stirring up strife and robbing"
2343,THE LEMNIAN,the old lords.  But the tides running strongly from the east were
2344,THE LEMNIAN,bringing some of the wreckage in an eddy into the bay.  He lay closer
2345,THE LEMNIAN,and watched the spars and splintered poops as they neared him.  These
2346,THE LEMNIAN,"were no galleys of the Hellenes.  Then came a drowned man, swollen and"
2347,THE LEMNIAN,"horrible:  then another-swarthy, hooknosed fellows, all yellow with the"
2348,THE LEMNIAN,sea.  Atta was puzzled.  They must be the men from the East about whom
2349,THE LEMNIAN,he had been hearing.  Long ere he left Lemnos there had been news about
2350,THE LEMNIAN,"the Persians.  They were coming like locusts out of the dawn, swarming"
2351,THE LEMNIAN,"over Ionia and Thrace, men and ships numerous beyond telling.  They"
2352,THE LEMNIAN,meant no ill to honest islanders:  a little earth and water were enough
2353,THE LEMNIAN,to win their friendship.  But they meant death to the hubris of the
2354,THE LEMNIAN,Hellenes.  Atta was on the side of the invaders; he wished them well in
2355,THE LEMNIAN,"their war with his ancient foes.  They would eat them up, Athenians,"
2356,THE LEMNIAN,"Lacedaemonians, Corinthians, Aeginetans, men of Argos and Elis, and"
2357,THE LEMNIAN,none would be left to trouble him.  But in the meantime something had
2358,THE LEMNIAN,gone wrong.  Clearly there had been no battle.  As the bodies butted
2359,THE LEMNIAN,against the side of the galley he hooked up one or two and found no
2360,THE LEMNIAN,"trace of a wound.  Poseidon had grown cranky, and had claimed victims."
2361,THE LEMNIAN,"The god would be appeased by this time, and all would go well."
2362,THE LEMNIAN,
2363,THE LEMNIAN,"Danger being past, he bade the men get ashore and fill the water-skins."
2364,THE LEMNIAN,"""God's curse on all Hellenes,"" he said, as he soaked up the cold water"
2365,THE LEMNIAN,from the spring in the thicket.
2366,THE LEMNIAN,
2367,THE LEMNIAN,"About noon he set sail again.  The wind sat in the north-east, but the"
2368,THE LEMNIAN,wall of Pelion turned it into a light stern breeze which carried him
2369,THE LEMNIAN,"swiftly westward.  The four slaves, still leg-weary and arm-weary, lay"
2370,THE LEMNIAN,like logs beside the thwarts.  Two slept; one munched some salty figs;
2371,THE LEMNIAN,"the fourth, the headman, stared wearily forward, with ever and again a"
2372,THE LEMNIAN,glance back at his master.  But the Lemnian never looked his way.  His
2373,THE LEMNIAN,"head was on his breast, as he steered, and he brooded on the sins of"
2374,THE LEMNIAN,"the Hellenes.  He was of the old Pelasgian stock, the first lords of"
2375,THE LEMNIAN,"the land, who had come out of the soil at the call of God.  The"
2376,THE LEMNIAN,pillaging northmen had crushed his folk out of the mainlands and most
2377,THE LEMNIAN,"of the islands, but in Lemnos they had met their match.  It was a"
2378,THE LEMNIAN,"family story how every grown male had been slain, and how the women"
2379,THE LEMNIAN,"long after had slaughtered their conquerors in the night.  ""Lemnian"
2380,THE LEMNIAN,"deeds,"" said the Hellenes, when they wished to speak of some shameful"
2381,THE LEMNIAN,thing:  but to Atta the shame was a glory to be cherished for ever.  He
2382,THE LEMNIAN,"and his kind were the ancient people, and the gods loved old things, as"
2383,THE LEMNIAN,those new folk would find.  Very especially he hated the men of Athens.
2384,THE LEMNIAN,"Had not one of their captains, Militades, beaten the Lemnians and"
2385,THE LEMNIAN,"brought the island under Athenian sway?  True, it was a rule only in"
2386,THE LEMNIAN,"name, for any Athenian who came alone to Lemnos would soon be cleaving"
2387,THE LEMNIAN,"the air from the highest cliff-top.  But the thought irked his pride,"
2388,THE LEMNIAN,and he gloated over the Persians' coming.  The Great King from beyond
2389,THE LEMNIAN,the deserts would smite those outrageous upstarts.  Atta would
2390,THE LEMNIAN,willingly give earth and water.  It was the whim of a fantastic
2391,THE LEMNIAN,"barbarian, and would be well repaid if the bastard Hellenes were"
2392,THE LEMNIAN,"destroyed.  They spoke his own tongue, and worshipped his own gods, and"
2393,THE LEMNIAN,yet did evil.  Let the nemesis of Zeus devour them!
2394,THE LEMNIAN,
2395,THE LEMNIAN,The wreckage pursued him everywhere.  Dead men shouldered the sides of
2396,THE LEMNIAN,"the galley, and the straits were stuck full of things like monstrous"
2397,THE LEMNIAN,"buoys, where tall ships had foundered.  At Artemision he thought he saw"
2398,THE LEMNIAN,"signs of an anchored fleet with the low poops of the Hellenes, and"
2399,THE LEMNIAN,"sheered off to the northern shores.  There, looking towards Oeta and"
2400,THE LEMNIAN,"the Malian Gulf, he found an anchorage at sunset.  The waters were ugly"
2401,THE LEMNIAN,"and the times ill, and he had come on an enterprise bigger than he had"
2402,THE LEMNIAN,"dreamed.  The Lemnian was a stout fellow, but he had no love for"
2403,THE LEMNIAN,"needless danger.  He laughed mirthlessly as he thought of his errand,"
2404,THE LEMNIAN,"for he was going to Hellas, to the shrine of the Hellenes."
2405,THE LEMNIAN,
2406,THE LEMNIAN,"It was a woman's doing, like most crazy enterprises.  Three years ago"
2407,THE LEMNIAN,"his wife had laboured hard in childbirth, and had had the whims of"
2408,THE LEMNIAN,"labouring women.  Up in the keep of Larisa, on the windy hillside,"
2409,THE LEMNIAN,there had been heart-searching and talk about the gods.  The little
2410,THE LEMNIAN,"olive-wood Hermes, the very private and particular god of Atta's folk,"
2411,THE LEMNIAN,"was good enough in simple things like a lambing or a harvest, but he"
2412,THE LEMNIAN,was scarcely fit for heavy tasks.  Atta's wife declared that her lord
2413,THE LEMNIAN,"lacked piety.  There were mainland gods who repaid worship, but his"
2414,THE LEMNIAN,scorn of all Hellenes made him blind to the merits of those potent
2415,THE LEMNIAN,divinities.  At first Atta resisted.  There was Attic blood in his
2416,THE LEMNIAN,"wife, and he strove to argue with her unorthodox craving.  But the"
2417,THE LEMNIAN,"woman persisted, and a Lemnian wife, as she is beyond other wives in"
2418,THE LEMNIAN,"virtue and comeliness, excels them in stubbornness of temper.  A second"
2419,THE LEMNIAN,"time she was with child, and nothing would content her but that Atta"
2420,THE LEMNIAN,"should make his prayers to the stronger gods.  Dodona was far away, and"
2421,THE LEMNIAN,long ere he reached it his throat would be cut in the hills.  But
2422,THE LEMNIAN,"Delphi was but two days' journey from the Malian coast, and the god of"
2423,THE LEMNIAN,"Delphi, the Far-Darter had surprising gifts, if one were to credit"
2424,THE LEMNIAN,"travellers' tales.  Atta yielded with an ill grace, and out of his"
2425,THE LEMNIAN,wealth devised an offering to Apollo.  So on this July day he found
2426,THE LEMNIAN,himself looking across the gulf to Kallidromos bound for a Hellenic
2427,THE LEMNIAN,"shrine, but hating all Hellenes in his soul.  A verse of Homer consoled"
2428,THE LEMNIAN,"him--the words which Phocion spoke to Achilles.  ""Verily even the gods"
2429,THE LEMNIAN,"may be turned, they whose excellence and honour and strength are"
2430,THE LEMNIAN,"greater than thine; yet even these do men, when they pray, turn from"
2431,THE LEMNIAN,"their purpose with offerings of incense and pleasant vows.""   The"
2432,THE LEMNIAN,"Far-Darter must hate the hubris  of those Hellenes, and be the more"
2433,THE LEMNIAN,"ready to avenge it since they dared to claim his countenance.  ""No race"
2434,THE LEMNIAN,"has ownership in the gods,"" a Lemnian song-maker had said when Atta had"
2435,THE LEMNIAN,been questioning the ways of Poseidon.
2436,THE LEMNIAN,
2437,THE LEMNIAN,The following dawn found him coasting past the north end of Euboea in
2438,THE LEMNIAN,the thin fog of a windless summer morn.  He steered by the peak of
2439,THE LEMNIAN,"Othrys and a spur of Oeta, as he had learnt from a slave who had"
2440,THE LEMNIAN,"travelled the road.  Presently he was in the muddy Malian waters, and"
2441,THE LEMNIAN,the sun was scattering the mist on the landward side.  And then he
2442,THE LEMNIAN,became aware of a greater commotion than Poseidon's play with the ships
2443,THE LEMNIAN,off Pelion.  A murmur like a winter's storm came seawards.  He lowered
2444,THE LEMNIAN,"the sail, which he had set to catch a chance breeze, and bade the men"
2445,THE LEMNIAN,rest on their oars.  An earthquake seemed to be tearing at the roots of
2446,THE LEMNIAN,the hills.
2447,THE LEMNIAN,
2448,THE LEMNIAN,"The mist rolled up, and his hawk eyes saw a strange sight.  The water"
2449,THE LEMNIAN,"was green and still around him, but shoreward it changed its colour."
2450,THE LEMNIAN,"It was a dirty red, and things bobbed about in it like the Persians in"
2451,THE LEMNIAN,"the creek of Sciathos.  On the strip of shore, below the sheer wall of"
2452,THE LEMNIAN,"Kallidromos, men were fighting-myriads of men, for away towards Locris"
2453,THE LEMNIAN,they stretched in ranks and banners and tents till the eye lost them in
2454,THE LEMNIAN,"the haze.  There was no sail on the queer, muddy-red-edged sea; there"
2455,THE LEMNIAN,was no man on the hills:  but on that one flat ribbon of sand all the
2456,THE LEMNIAN,nations of the earth were warring.  He remembered about the place:
2457,THE LEMNIAN,"Thermopylae they called it, the Gate of the Hot Springs.  The Hellenes"
2458,THE LEMNIAN,were fighting the Persians in the pass for their Fatherland.
2459,THE LEMNIAN,
2460,THE LEMNIAN,Atta was prudent and loved not other men's quarrels.  He gave the word
2461,THE LEMNIAN,to the rowers to row seaward.  In twenty strokes they were in the mist
2462,THE LEMNIAN,again...
2463,THE LEMNIAN,
2464,THE LEMNIAN,"Atta was prudent, but he was also stubborn.  He spent the day in a"
2465,THE LEMNIAN,"creek on the northern shore of the gulf, listening to the weird hum"
2466,THE LEMNIAN,which came over the waters out of the haze.  He cursed the delay.  Up
2467,THE LEMNIAN,on Kallidromos would be clear dry air and the path to Delphi among the
2468,THE LEMNIAN,oak woods.  The Hellenes could not be fighting everywhere at once.  He
2469,THE LEMNIAN,"might find some spot on the shore, far in their rear, where he could"
2470,THE LEMNIAN,"land and gain the hills.  There was danger indeed, but once on the"
2471,THE LEMNIAN,ridge he would be safe; and by the time he came back the Great King
2472,THE LEMNIAN,"would have swept the defenders into the sea, and be well on the road"
2473,THE LEMNIAN,for Athens.  He asked himself if it were fitting that a Lemnian should
2474,THE LEMNIAN,be stayed in his holy task by the struggles of Hellene and Barbarian.
2475,THE LEMNIAN,"His thoughts flew to his steading at Larisa, and the dark-eyed wife who"
2476,THE LEMNIAN,was awaiting his homecoming.  He could not return without Apollo's
2477,THE LEMNIAN,favour:  his manhood and the memory of his lady's eyes forbade it.  So
2478,THE LEMNIAN,late in the afternoon he pushed off again and steered his galley for
2479,THE LEMNIAN,the south.
2480,THE LEMNIAN,
2481,THE LEMNIAN,About sunset the mist cleared from the sea; but the dark falls swiftly
2482,THE LEMNIAN,"in the shadow of the high hills, and Atta had no fear.  With the night"
2483,THE LEMNIAN,the hum sank to a whisper; it seemed that the invaders were drawing off
2484,THE LEMNIAN,"to camp, for the sound receded to the west.  At the last light the"
2485,THE LEMNIAN,Lemnian touched a rock-point well to the rear of the defence.  He
2486,THE LEMNIAN,noticed that the spume at the tide's edge was reddish and stuck to his
2487,THE LEMNIAN,hands like gum.  Of a surety much blood was flowing on that coast.
2488,THE LEMNIAN,
2489,THE LEMNIAN,He bade his slaves return to the north shore and lie hidden to await
2490,THE LEMNIAN,him.  When he came back he would light a signal fire on the topmost
2491,THE LEMNIAN,bluff of Kallidromos.  Let them watch for it and come to take him off.
2492,THE LEMNIAN,"Then he seized his bow and quiver, and his short hunting-spear, buckled"
2493,THE LEMNIAN,"his cloak about him, saw that the gift to Apollo was safe in the folds"
2494,THE LEMNIAN,"of it, and marched sturdily up the hillside."
2495,THE LEMNIAN,
2496,THE LEMNIAN,"The moon was in her first quarter, a slim horn which at her rise showed"
2497,THE LEMNIAN,"only the faint outline of the hill.  Atta plodded steadfastly on, but"
2498,THE LEMNIAN,"he found the way hard.  This was not like the crisp sea-turf of Lemnos,"
2499,THE LEMNIAN,"where among the barrows of the ancient dead, sheep and kine could find"
2500,THE LEMNIAN,sweet fodder.  Kallidromos ran up as steep as the roof of a barn.
2501,THE LEMNIAN,"Cytisus and thyme and juniper grew rank, but above all the place was"
2502,THE LEMNIAN,"strewn with rocks, leg-twisting boulders, and great cliffs where eagles"
2503,THE LEMNIAN,"dwelt.  Being a seaman, Atta had his bearings.  The path to Delphi left"
2504,THE LEMNIAN,"the shore road near the Hot Springs, and went south by a rift of the"
2505,THE LEMNIAN,mountain.  If he went up the slope in a beeline he must strike it in
2506,THE LEMNIAN,time and find better going.  Still it was an eerie place to be tramping
2507,THE LEMNIAN,"after dark.  The Hellenes had strange gods of the thicket and hillside,"
2508,THE LEMNIAN,and he had no wish to intrude upon their sanctuaries.  He told himself
2509,THE LEMNIAN,"that next to the Hellenes he hated this country of theirs, where a man"
2510,THE LEMNIAN,sweltered in hot jungles or tripped among hidden crags.  He sighed for
2511,THE LEMNIAN,"the cool beaches below Larisa, where the surf was white as the snows of"
2512,THE LEMNIAN,"Samothrace, and the fisherboys sang round their smoking broth-pots."
2513,THE LEMNIAN,
2514,THE LEMNIAN,"Presently he found a path.  It was not the mule road, worn by many"
2515,THE LEMNIAN,"feet, that he had looked for, but a little track which twined among the"
2516,THE LEMNIAN,"boulders.  Still it eased his feet, so he cleared the thorns from his"
2517,THE LEMNIAN,"sandals, strapped his belt tighter, and stepped out more confidently."
2518,THE LEMNIAN,"Up and up he went, making odd detours among the crags.  Once he came to"
2519,THE LEMNIAN,"a promontory, and, looking down, saw lights twinkling from the Hot"
2520,THE LEMNIAN,"Springs.  He had thought the course lay more southerly, but consoled"
2521,THE LEMNIAN,himself by remembering that a mountain path must have many windings.
2522,THE LEMNIAN,"The great matter was that he was ascending, for he knew that he must"
2523,THE LEMNIAN,cross the ridge of Oeta before he struck the Locrian glens that led to
2524,THE LEMNIAN,the Far-Darter's shrine.
2525,THE LEMNIAN,
2526,THE LEMNIAN,"At what seemed the summit of the first ridge he halted for breath, and,"
2527,THE LEMNIAN,"prone on the thyme, looked back to sea.  The Hot Springs were hidden,"
2528,THE LEMNIAN,but across the gulf a single light shone from the far shore.  He
2529,THE LEMNIAN,guessed that by this time his galley had been beached and his slaves
2530,THE LEMNIAN,were cooking supper.  The thought made him homesick.  He had beaten and
2531,THE LEMNIAN,"cursed these slaves of his times without number, but now in this"
2532,THE LEMNIAN,"strange land he felt them kinsfolk, men of his own household.  Then he"
2533,THE LEMNIAN,told himself he was no better than a woman.  Had he not gone sailing to
2534,THE LEMNIAN,"Chalcedon and distant Pontus, many months' journey from home while this"
2535,THE LEMNIAN,was but a trip of days?  In a week he would be welcomed by a smiling
2536,THE LEMNIAN,"wife, with a friendly god behind him."
2537,THE LEMNIAN,
2538,THE LEMNIAN,"The track still bore west, though Delphi lay in the south.  Moreover,"
2539,THE LEMNIAN,he had come to a broader road running through a little tableland.  The
2540,THE LEMNIAN,"highest peaks of Oeta were dark against the sky, and around him was a"
2541,THE LEMNIAN,flat glade where oaks whispered in the night breezes.  By this time he
2542,THE LEMNIAN,"judged from the stars that midnight had passed, and he began to"
2543,THE LEMNIAN,"consider whether, now that he was beyond the fighting, he should not"
2544,THE LEMNIAN,"sleep and wait for dawn.  He made up his mind to find a shelter, and,"
2545,THE LEMNIAN,"in the aimless way of the night traveller, pushed on and on in the"
2546,THE LEMNIAN,"quest of it.  The truth is his mind was on Lemnos, and a dark-eyed,"
2547,THE LEMNIAN,white-armed dame spinning in the evening by the threshold.  His eyes
2548,THE LEMNIAN,"roamed among the oaktrees, but vacantly and idly, and many a mossy"
2549,THE LEMNIAN,"corner was passed unheeded.  He forgot his ill temper, and hummed"
2550,THE LEMNIAN,cheerfully the song his reapers sang in the barley-fields below his
2551,THE LEMNIAN,"orchard.  It was a song of seamen turned husbandmen, for the gods it"
2552,THE LEMNIAN,called on were the gods of the sea....
2553,THE LEMNIAN,
2554,THE LEMNIAN,"Suddenly he found himself crouching among the young oaks, peering and"
2555,THE LEMNIAN,listening.  There was something coming from the west.  It was like the
2556,THE LEMNIAN,"first mutterings of a storm in a narrow harbour, a steady rustling and"
2557,THE LEMNIAN,whispering.  It was not wind; he knew winds too well to be deceived.
2558,THE LEMNIAN,"It was the tramp of light-shod feet among the twigs--many feet, for the"
2559,THE LEMNIAN,"sound remained steady, while the noise of a few men will rise and fall."
2560,THE LEMNIAN,They were coming fast and coming silently.  The war had reached far up
2561,THE LEMNIAN,Kallidromos.
2562,THE LEMNIAN,
2563,THE LEMNIAN,Atta had played this game often in the little island wars.  Very
2564,THE LEMNIAN,swiftly he ran back and away from the path up the slope which he knew
2565,THE LEMNIAN,"to be the first ridge of Kallidromos.  The army, whatever it might be,"
2566,THE LEMNIAN,was on the Delphian road.  Were the Hellenes about to turn the flank of
2567,THE LEMNIAN,the Great King?
2568,THE LEMNIAN,
2569,THE LEMNIAN,"A moment later he laughed at his folly.  For the men began to appear,"
2570,THE LEMNIAN,"and they were crossing to meet him, coming from the west.  Lying close"
2571,THE LEMNIAN,in the brushwood he could see them clearly.  It was well he had left
2572,THE LEMNIAN,"the road, for they stuck to it, following every winding-crouching, too,"
2573,THE LEMNIAN,"like hunters after deer.  The first man he saw was a Hellene, but the"
2574,THE LEMNIAN,ranks behind were no Hellenes.  There was no glint of bronze or gleam
2575,THE LEMNIAN,"of fair skin.  They were dark, long-haired fellows, with spears like"
2576,THE LEMNIAN,"his own, and round Eastern caps, and egg-shaped bucklers.  Then Atta"
2577,THE LEMNIAN,rejoiced.  It was the Great King who was turning the flank of the
2578,THE LEMNIAN,"Hellenes.  They guarded the gate, the fools, while the enemy slipped"
2579,THE LEMNIAN,through the roof.
2580,THE LEMNIAN,
2581,THE LEMNIAN,He did not rejoice long.  The van of the army was narrow and kept to
2582,THE LEMNIAN,"the path, but the men behind were straggling all over the hillside."
2583,THE LEMNIAN,Another minute and he would be discovered. The thought was cheerless.
2584,THE LEMNIAN,"It was true that he was an islander and friendly to the Persian, but up"
2585,THE LEMNIAN,on the heights who would listen to his tale?  He would be taken for a
2586,THE LEMNIAN,"spy, and one of those thirsty spears would drink his blood.  It must be"
2587,THE LEMNIAN,"farewell to Delphi for the moment, he thought, or farewell to Lemnos"
2588,THE LEMNIAN,"for ever.  Crouching low, he ran back and away from the path to the"
2589,THE LEMNIAN,crest of the sea-ridge of Kallidromos.
2590,THE LEMNIAN,
2591,THE LEMNIAN,The men came no nearer him.  They were keeping roughly to the line of
2592,THE LEMNIAN,"the path, and drifted through the oak wood before him, an army without"
2593,THE LEMNIAN,end.  He had scarcely thought there were so many fighting men in the
2594,THE LEMNIAN,"world.  He resolved to lie there on the crest, in the hope that ere the"
2595,THE LEMNIAN,"first light they would be gone.  Then he would push on to Delphi,"
2596,THE LEMNIAN,leaving them to settle their quarrels behind him.  These were the hard
2597,THE LEMNIAN,times for a pious pilgrim.
2598,THE LEMNIAN,
2599,THE LEMNIAN,But another noise caught his ear from the right.  The army had flanking
2600,THE LEMNIAN,"squadrons, and men were coming along the ridge.  Very bitter anger rose"
2601,THE LEMNIAN,"in Atta's heart.  He had cursed the Hellenes, and now he cursed the"
2602,THE LEMNIAN,"Barbarians no less.  Nay, he cursed all war, that spoiled the errands"
2603,THE LEMNIAN,"of peaceful folk.  And then, seeking safety, he dropped over the crest"
2604,THE LEMNIAN,on to the steep shoreward face of the mountain.
2605,THE LEMNIAN,
2606,THE LEMNIAN,In an instant his breath had gone from him.  He slid down a long slope
2607,THE LEMNIAN,"of screes, and then with a gasp found himself falling sheer into space."
2608,THE LEMNIAN,"Another second and he was caught in a tangle of bush, and then dropped"
2609,THE LEMNIAN,"once more upon screes, where he clutched desperately for handhold."
2610,THE LEMNIAN,Breathless and bleeding he came to anchor on a shelf of greensward and
2611,THE LEMNIAN,found himself blinking up at the crest which seemed to tower a thousand
2612,THE LEMNIAN,feet above.  There were men on the crest now.  He heard them speak and
2613,THE LEMNIAN,felt that they were looking down.
2614,THE LEMNIAN,
2615,THE LEMNIAN,The shock kept him still till the men had passed.  Then the terror of
2616,THE LEMNIAN,"the place gripped him, and he tried feverishly to retrace his steps.  A"
2617,THE LEMNIAN,"dweller all his days among gentle downs, he grew dizzy with the sense"
2618,THE LEMNIAN,of being hung in space.  But the only fruit of his efforts was to set
2619,THE LEMNIAN,"him slipping again.  This time he pulled up at the root of gnarled oak,"
2620,THE LEMNIAN,which overhung the sheerest cliff on Kallidromos.  The danger brought
2621,THE LEMNIAN,"his wits back.  He sullenly reviewed his case, and found it desperate."
2622,THE LEMNIAN,
2623,THE LEMNIAN,"He could not go back, and, even if he did, he would meet the Persians."
2624,THE LEMNIAN,"If he went on he would break his neck, or at the best fall into the"
2625,THE LEMNIAN,Hellenes' hands.  Oddly enough he feared his old enemies less than his
2626,THE LEMNIAN,"friends.  He did not think that the Hellenes would butcher him.  Again,"
2627,THE LEMNIAN,"he might sit perched in his eyrie till they settled their quarrel, or"
2628,THE LEMNIAN,he fell off.  He rejected this last way.  Fall off he should for
2629,THE LEMNIAN,"certain, unless he kept moving.  Already he was retching with the"
2630,THE LEMNIAN,vertigo of the heights.  It was growing lighter.  Suddenly he was
2631,THE LEMNIAN,"looking not into a black world, but to a pearl-grey floor far beneath"
2632,THE LEMNIAN,"him.  It was the sea, the thing he knew and loved.  The sight screwed"
2633,THE LEMNIAN,up his courage.  He remembered that he was Lemnian and a seafarer.  He
2634,THE LEMNIAN,"would be conquered neither by rock, nor by Hellene, nor by the Great"
2635,THE LEMNIAN,"King.  Least of all by the last, who was a barbarian.  Slowly, with"
2636,THE LEMNIAN,"clenched teeth and narrowed eyes, he began to clamber down a ridge"
2637,THE LEMNIAN,which flanked the great cliffs of Kallidromos.  His plan was to reach
2638,THE LEMNIAN,the shore and take the road to the east before the Persians completed
2639,THE LEMNIAN,their circuit.  Some instinct told him that a great army would not take
2640,THE LEMNIAN,the track he had mounted by.  There must be some longer and easier way
2641,THE LEMNIAN,debouching farther down the coast.  He might yet have the good luck to
2642,THE LEMNIAN,slip between them and the sea.
2643,THE LEMNIAN,
2644,THE LEMNIAN,"The two hours which followed tried his courage hard.  Thrice he fell,"
2645,THE LEMNIAN,and only a juniper-root stood between him and death.  His hands grew
2646,THE LEMNIAN,"ragged, and his nails were worn to the quick.  He had long ago lost his"
2647,THE LEMNIAN,"weapons; his cloak was in shreds, all save the breast-fold which held"
2648,THE LEMNIAN,"the gift to Apollo.  The heavens brightened, but he dared not look"
2649,THE LEMNIAN,"around.  He knew he was traversing awesome places, where a goat could"
2650,THE LEMNIAN,scarcely tread.  Many times he gave up hope of life.  His head was
2651,THE LEMNIAN,"swimming, and he was so deadly sick that often he had to lie gasping on"
2652,THE LEMNIAN,some shoulder of rock less steep than the rest.  But his anger kept him
2653,THE LEMNIAN,to his purpose.  He was filled with fury at the Hellenes.  It was they
2654,THE LEMNIAN,and their folly that had brought him these mischances.  Some day ....
2655,THE LEMNIAN,
2656,THE LEMNIAN,He found himself sitting blinking on the shore of the sea.  A furlong
2657,THE LEMNIAN,"off the water was lapping on the reefs.  A man, larger than human in"
2658,THE LEMNIAN,"the morning mist, was standing above him."
2659,THE LEMNIAN,
2660,THE LEMNIAN,"""Greeting, stranger,"" said the voice.  ""By Hermes, you choose the"
2661,THE LEMNIAN,"difficult roads to travel."""
2662,THE LEMNIAN,
2663,THE LEMNIAN,"Atta felt for broken bones, and, reassured, struggled to his feet."
2664,THE LEMNIAN,
2665,THE LEMNIAN,"""God's curse upon all mountains,"" he said.  He staggered to the edge of"
2666,THE LEMNIAN,the tide and laved his brow.  The savour of salt revived him.  He
2667,THE LEMNIAN,"turned to find the tall man at his elbow, and noted how worn and ragged"
2668,THE LEMNIAN,"he was, and yet how upright.  ""When a pigeon is flushed from the rocks,"
2669,THE LEMNIAN,"there is a hawk near,"" said the voice."
2670,THE LEMNIAN,
2671,THE LEMNIAN,"Atta was angry.  ""A hawk!""  he cried.  ""Nay, an army of eagles.  There"
2672,THE LEMNIAN,"will be some rare flushing of Hellenes before evening."""
2673,THE LEMNIAN,
2674,THE LEMNIAN,"""What frightened you, Islander?""  the stranger asked.  ""Did a wolf bark"
2675,THE LEMNIAN,"up on the hillside?"""
2676,THE LEMNIAN,
2677,THE LEMNIAN,"""Ay, a wolf.  The wolf from the East with a multitude of wolflings."
2678,THE LEMNIAN,"There will be fine eating soon in the pass."""
2679,THE LEMNIAN,
2680,THE LEMNIAN,The man's face grew dark.  He put his hand to his mouth and called.
2681,THE LEMNIAN,Half a dozen sentries ran to join him.  He spoke to them in the harsh
2682,THE LEMNIAN,Lacedaemonian speech which made Atta sick to hear.  They talked with
2683,THE LEMNIAN,"the back of the throat and there was not an ""s"" in their words."
2684,THE LEMNIAN,
2685,THE LEMNIAN,"""There is mischief in the hills,"" the first man said.  ""This islander"
2686,THE LEMNIAN,has been frightened down over the rocks.  The Persian is stealing a
2687,THE LEMNIAN,"march on us."""
2688,THE LEMNIAN,
2689,THE LEMNIAN,The sentries laughed.  One quoted a proverb about island courage.
2690,THE LEMNIAN,Atta's wrath flared and he forgot himself.  He had no wish to warn the
2691,THE LEMNIAN,"Hellenes, but it irked his pride to be thought a liar.  He began to"
2692,THE LEMNIAN,"tell his story hastily, angrily, confusedly; and the men still laughed."
2693,THE LEMNIAN,
2694,THE LEMNIAN,Then he turned eastward and saw the proof before him.  The light had
2695,THE LEMNIAN,grown and the sun was coming up over Pelion.  The first beam fell on
2696,THE LEMNIAN,"the eastern ridge of Kallidromos, and there, clear on the sky-line, was"
2697,THE LEMNIAN,"the proof.  The Persian was making a wide circuit, but moving"
2698,THE LEMNIAN,"shoreward.  In a little he would be at the coast, and by noon at the"
2699,THE LEMNIAN,Hellenes' rear.
2700,THE LEMNIAN,
2701,THE LEMNIAN,His hearers doubted no more.  Atta was hurried forward through the
2702,THE LEMNIAN,"lines of the Greeks to the narrow throat of the pass, where behind a"
2703,THE LEMNIAN,rough rampart of stones lay the Lacedaemonian headquarters.  He was
2704,THE LEMNIAN,"still giddy from the heights, and it was in a giddy dream that he"
2705,THE LEMNIAN,traversed the misty shingles of the beach amid ranks of sleeping
2706,THE LEMNIAN,"warriors.  It was a grim place, for there were dead and dying in it,"
2707,THE LEMNIAN,and blood on every stone.  But in the lee of the wall little fires were
2708,THE LEMNIAN,burning and slaves were cooking breakfast.  The smell of roasting flesh
2709,THE LEMNIAN,"came pleasantly to his nostrils, and he remembered that he had had no"
2710,THE LEMNIAN,meal since he crossed the gulf.
2711,THE LEMNIAN,
2712,THE LEMNIAN,Then he found himself the centre of a group who had the air of kings.
2713,THE LEMNIAN,They looked as if they had been years in war.  Never had he seen faces
2714,THE LEMNIAN,so worn and so terribly scarred.  The hollows in their cheeks gave them
2715,THE LEMNIAN,"the air of smiling, and yet they were grave.  Their scarlet vests were"
2716,THE LEMNIAN,"torn and muddled, and the armour which lay near was dinted like the"
2717,THE LEMNIAN,scrap-iron before a smithy door.  But what caught his attention were
2718,THE LEMNIAN,the eyes of the men.  They glittered as no eyes he had ever seen before
2719,THE LEMNIAN,glittered.  The sight cleared his bewilderment and took the pride out
2720,THE LEMNIAN,of his heart.  He could not pretend to despise a folk who looked like
2721,THE LEMNIAN,Ares fresh from the wars of the Immortals.
2722,THE LEMNIAN,
2723,THE LEMNIAN,"They spoke among themselves in quiet voices.  Scouts came and went, and"
2724,THE LEMNIAN,"once or twice one of the men, taller than the rest, asked Atta a"
2725,THE LEMNIAN,"question.  The Lemnian sat in the heart of the group, sniffing the"
2726,THE LEMNIAN,"smell of cooking, and looking at the rents in his cloak and the long"
2727,THE LEMNIAN,"scratches on his legs.  Something was pressing on his breast, and he"
2728,THE LEMNIAN,found that it was Apollo's gift.  He had forgotten all about it.
2729,THE LEMNIAN,"Delphi seemed beyond the moon, and his errand a child's dream."
2730,THE LEMNIAN,
2731,THE LEMNIAN,"Then the King, for so he thought of the tall man, spoke--"
2732,THE LEMNIAN,
2733,THE LEMNIAN,"""You have done us a service, Islander.  The Persian is at our back and"
2734,THE LEMNIAN,"front, and there will be no escape for those who stay.  Our allies are"
2735,THE LEMNIAN,"going home, for they do not share our vows.  We of Lacedaemon wait in"
2736,THE LEMNIAN,the pass.  If you go with the men of Corinth you will find a place of
2737,THE LEMNIAN,safety before noon.  No doubt in the Euripus there is some boat to take
2738,THE LEMNIAN,"you to your own land."""
2739,THE LEMNIAN,
2740,THE LEMNIAN,"He spoke courteously, not in the rude Athenian way; and somehow the"
2741,THE LEMNIAN,quietness of his voice and his glittering eyes roused wild longings in
2742,THE LEMNIAN,Atta's heart.  His island pride was face to face with a greater-greater
2743,THE LEMNIAN,than he had ever dreamed of.
2744,THE LEMNIAN,
2745,THE LEMNIAN,"""Bid yon cooks give me some broth,"" he said gruffly.  ""I am faint."
2746,THE LEMNIAN,"After I have eaten I will speak with you."""
2747,THE LEMNIAN,
2748,THE LEMNIAN,"He was given food, and as he ate he thought.  He was on trial before"
2749,THE LEMNIAN,"these men of Lacedaemon.  More, the old faith of the islands, the pride"
2750,THE LEMNIAN,"of the first masters, was at stake in his hands.  He had boasted that"
2751,THE LEMNIAN,he and his kind were the last of the men; now these Hellenes of
2752,THE LEMNIAN,"Lacedaemon were preparing a great deed, and they deemed him unworthy to"
2753,THE LEMNIAN,share in it.  They offered him safety.  Could he brook the insult?  He
2754,THE LEMNIAN,had forgotten that the cause of the Persian was his; that the Hellenes
2755,THE LEMNIAN,were the foes of his race.  He saw only that the last test of manhood
2756,THE LEMNIAN,was preparing and the manhood in him rose to greet the trial.  An odd
2757,THE LEMNIAN,"wild ecstasy surged in his veins.  It was not the lust of battle, for"
2758,THE LEMNIAN,"he had no love of slaying, or hate for the Persian, for he was his"
2759,THE LEMNIAN,friend.  It was the sheer joy of proving that the Lemnian stock had a
2760,THE LEMNIAN,starker pride than these men of Lacedamon.  They would die for their
2761,THE LEMNIAN,"fatherland, and their vows; but he, for a whim, a scruple, a delicacy"
2762,THE LEMNIAN,of honour.  His mind was so clear that no other course occurred to him.
2763,THE LEMNIAN,"There was only one way for a man.  He, too, would be dying for his"
2764,THE LEMNIAN,"fatherland, for through him the island race would be ennobled in the"
2765,THE LEMNIAN,eyes of gods and men.
2766,THE LEMNIAN,
2767,THE LEMNIAN,"Troops were filing fast to the east--Thebans, Corinthians.  ""Time"
2768,THE LEMNIAN,"flies, Islander,"" said the King's voice.  ""The hours of safety are"
2769,THE LEMNIAN,"slipping past.""  Atta looked up carelessly.  ""I will stay,"" he said."
2770,THE LEMNIAN,"""God's curse on all Hellenes!  Little I care for your quarrels.  It is"
2771,THE LEMNIAN,nothing to me if your Hellas is under the heels of the East.  But I
2772,THE LEMNIAN,"care much for brave men.  It shall never be said that a man of Lemnos,"
2773,THE LEMNIAN,"a son of the old race, fell back when Death threatened.  I stay with"
2774,THE LEMNIAN,"you, men of Lacedaemon."""
2775,THE LEMNIAN,
2776,THE LEMNIAN,The King's eyes glittered; they seemed to peer into his heart.
2777,THE LEMNIAN,
2778,THE LEMNIAN,"""It appears they breed men in the islands,"" he said.  ""But you err."
2779,THE LEMNIAN,Death does not threaten.  Death awaits us.
2780,THE LEMNIAN,
2781,THE LEMNIAN,"""It is all one,"" said Atta.  ""But I crave a boon.  Let me fight my last"
2782,THE LEMNIAN,"fight by your side.  I am of older stock than you, and a king in my own"
2783,THE LEMNIAN,"country.  I would strike my last blow among kings."""
2784,THE LEMNIAN,
2785,THE LEMNIAN,"There was an hour of respite before battle was joined, and Atta spent"
2786,THE LEMNIAN,"it by the edge of the sea.  He had been given arms, and in girding"
2787,THE LEMNIAN,himself for the fight he had found Apollo's offering in his breastfold.
2788,THE LEMNIAN,He was done with the gods of the Hellenes.  His offering should go to
2789,THE LEMNIAN,"the gods of his own people.  So, calling upon Poseidon, he flung the"
2790,THE LEMNIAN,"little gold cup far out to sea.  It flashed in the sunlight, and then"
2791,THE LEMNIAN,sank in the soft green tides so noiselessly that it seemed as if the
2792,THE LEMNIAN,"hand of the Sea-god had been stretched to take it.  ""Hail, Poseidon!"""
2793,THE LEMNIAN,"the Lemnian cried. ""I am bound this day for the Ferryman.  To you only"
2794,THE LEMNIAN,"I make prayer, and to the little Hermes of Larisa.  Be kind to my kin"
2795,THE LEMNIAN,"when they travel the sea, and keep them islanders and seafarers for"
2796,THE LEMNIAN,"ever.  Hail and farewell, God of my own folk!"""
2797,THE LEMNIAN,
2798,THE LEMNIAN,"Then, while the little waves lapped on the white sand, Atta made a"
2799,THE LEMNIAN,"song.  He was thinking of the homestead far up in the green downs,"
2800,THE LEMNIAN,looking over to the snows of Samothrace.  At this hour in the morning
2801,THE LEMNIAN,there would be a tinkle of sheep-bells as the flocks went down to the
2802,THE LEMNIAN,"low pastures.  Cool wind would be blowing, and the noise of the surf"
2803,THE LEMNIAN,below the cliffs would come faint to the ear.  In the hall the maids
2804,THE LEMNIAN,"mould be spinning, while their dark-haired mistress would be casting"
2805,THE LEMNIAN,"swift glances to the doorway, lest it might be filled any moment by the"
2806,THE LEMNIAN,form of her returning lord.  Outside in the chequered sunlight of the
2807,THE LEMNIAN,"orchard the child would be playing with his nurse, crooning in childish"
2808,THE LEMNIAN,syllables the chanty his father had taught him.  And at the thought of
2809,THE LEMNIAN,"his home a great passion welled up in Atta's heart.  It was not regret,"
2810,THE LEMNIAN,but joy and pride and aching love.  In his antique island creed the
2811,THE LEMNIAN,death he was awaiting was not other than a bridal.  He was dying for
2812,THE LEMNIAN,"the things he loved, and by his death they would be blessed eternally."
2813,THE LEMNIAN,He would not have long to wait before bright eyes came to greet him in
2814,THE LEMNIAN,the House of Shadows.
2815,THE LEMNIAN,
2816,THE LEMNIAN,"So Atta made the Song of Atta, and sang it then, and later in the press"
2817,THE LEMNIAN,"of battle.  It was a simple song, like the lays of seafarers.  It put"
2818,THE LEMNIAN,into rough verse the thought which cheers the heart of all
2819,THE LEMNIAN,"adventurers--nay, which makes adventure possible for those who have"
2820,THE LEMNIAN,much to leave.  It spoke of the shining pathway of the sea which is the
2821,THE LEMNIAN,Great Uniter.  A man may lie dead in Pontus or beyond the Pillars of
2822,THE LEMNIAN,"Herakles, but if he dies on the shore there is nothing between him and"
2823,THE LEMNIAN,his fatherland.  It spoke of a battle all the long dark night in a
2824,THE LEMNIAN,strange place--a place of marshes and black cliffs and shadowy terrors.
2825,THE LEMNIAN,
2826,THE LEMNIAN,"""In the dawn the sweet light comes,"" said the song, ""and the salt winds"
2827,THE LEMNIAN,"and the tides will bear me home..."""
2828,THE LEMNIAN,
2829,THE LEMNIAN,"When in the evening the Persians took toll of the dead, they found one"
2830,THE LEMNIAN,man who puzzled them.  He lay among the tall Lacedaemonians on the very
2831,THE LEMNIAN,"lip of the sea, and around him were swathes of their countrymen.  It"
2832,THE LEMNIAN,"looked as if he had been fighting his way to the water, and had been"
2833,THE LEMNIAN,overtaken by death as his feet reached the edge.  Nowhere in the pass
2834,THE LEMNIAN,"did the dead lie so thick, and yet he was no Hellene.  He was torn like"
2835,THE LEMNIAN,"a deer that the dogs have worried, but the little left of his garments"
2836,THE LEMNIAN,and his features spoke of Eastern race.  The survivors could tell
2837,THE LEMNIAN,nothing except that he had fought like a god and had been singing all
2838,THE LEMNIAN,the while.
2839,THE LEMNIAN,
2840,THE LEMNIAN,The matter came to the ear of the Great King who was sore enough at the
2841,THE LEMNIAN,issue of the day.  That one of his men had performed feats of valeur
2842,THE LEMNIAN,beyond the Hellenes was a pleasant tale to tell.  And so his captains
2843,THE LEMNIAN,reported it.  Accordingly when the fleet from Artemision arrived next
2844,THE LEMNIAN,"morning, and all but a few score Persians were shovelled into holes,"
2845,THE LEMNIAN,"that the Hellenes might seem to have been conquered by a lesser force,"
2846,THE LEMNIAN,Atta's body was laid out with pomp in the midst of the Lacedaemonians.
2847,THE LEMNIAN,And the seamen rubbed their eyes and thanked their strange gods that
2848,THE LEMNIAN,one man of the East had been found to match those terrible warriors
2849,THE LEMNIAN,"whose name was a nightmare.  Further, the Great King gave orders that"
2850,THE LEMNIAN,"the body of Atta should be embalmed and carried with the army, and that"
2851,THE LEMNIAN,his name and kin should be sought out and duly honoured.  This latter
2852,THE LEMNIAN,"was a task too hard for the staff, and no more was heard of it till"
2853,THE LEMNIAN,"months later, when the King, in full flight after Salamis, bethought"
2854,THE LEMNIAN,him of the one man who had not played him false.  Finding that his
2855,THE LEMNIAN,"lieutenants had nothing to tell him, he eased five of them of their"
2856,THE LEMNIAN,heads.
2857,THE LEMNIAN,
2858,THE LEMNIAN,"As it happened, the deed was not quite forgotten.  An islander, a"
2859,THE LEMNIAN,"Lesbian and a cautious man, had fought at Thermopylae in the Persian"
2860,THE LEMNIAN,"ranks, and had heard Atta's singing and seen how he fell.  Long"
2861,THE LEMNIAN,"afterwards some errand took this man to Lemnos, and in the evening,"
2862,THE LEMNIAN,"speaking with the Elders, he told his tale and repeated something of"
2863,THE LEMNIAN,"the song.  There was that in the words which gave the Lemnians a clue,"
2864,THE LEMNIAN,"the mention, I think, of the olive-wood Hermes and the snows of"
2865,THE LEMNIAN,"Samothrace.  So Atta came to great honour among his own people, and his"
2866,THE LEMNIAN,memory and his words were handed down to the generations.  The song
2867,THE LEMNIAN,"became a favourite island lay, and for centuries throughout the Aegean"
2868,THE LEMNIAN,"seafaring men sang it when they turned their prows to wild seas.  Nay,"
2869,THE LEMNIAN,"it travelled farther, for you will find part of it stolen by Euripides"
2870,THE LEMNIAN,and put in a chorus of the Andromache.  There are echoes of it in some
2871,THE LEMNIAN,"of the epigrams of the Anthology; and, though the old days have gone,"
2872,THE LEMNIAN,the simple fisher-folk still sing snatches in their barbarous dialect.
2873,THE LEMNIAN,The Klephts used to make a catch of it at night round their fires in
2874,THE LEMNIAN,"the hills, and only the other day I met a man in Scyros who had"
2875,THE LEMNIAN,"collected a dozen variants, and was publishing them in a dull book on"
2876,THE LEMNIAN,island folklore.
2877,THE LEMNIAN,
2878,THE LEMNIAN,"In the centuries which followed the great fight, the sea fell away from"
2879,THE LEMNIAN,the roots of the cliffs and left a mile of marshland.  About fifty
2880,THE LEMNIAN,"years ago a peasant, digging in a rice-field, found the cup which Atta"
2881,THE LEMNIAN,"bad given to Poseidon. There was much talk about the discovery, and"
2882,THE LEMNIAN,scholars debated hotly about its origin.  To-day it is in the Berlin
2883,THE LEMNIAN,"Museum, and according to the new fashion in archaeology it is labelled"
2884,THE LEMNIAN,"""Minoan,"" and kept in the Cretan Section.  But any one who looks"
2885,THE LEMNIAN,carefully will see behind the rim a neat little carving of a dolphin;
2886,THE LEMNIAN,and I happen to know that that was the private badge of Atta's house.

2994,--TERTULLIAN.,--TERTULLIAN.
2995,--TERTULLIAN.,
2996,--TERTULLIAN.,
2997,--TERTULLIAN.,Leithen told me this story one evening in early September as we sat
2998,--TERTULLIAN.,beside the pony track which gropes its way from Glenvalin up the Correi
2999,--TERTULLIAN.,"na Sidhe.  I had arrived that afternoon from the south, while he had"
3000,--TERTULLIAN.,"been taking an off-day from a week's stalking, so we had walked up the"
3001,--TERTULLIAN.,glen together after tea to get the news of the forest.  A rifle was out
3002,--TERTULLIAN.,"on the Correi na Sidhe beat, and a thin spire of smoke had risen from"
3003,--TERTULLIAN.,the top of Sgurr Dearg to show that a stag had been killed at the
3004,--TERTULLIAN.,burnhead.  The lumpish hill pony with its deer-saddle had gone up the
3005,--TERTULLIAN.,"Correi in a gillie's charge while we followed at leisure, picking our"
3006,--TERTULLIAN.,way among the loose granite rocks and the patches of wet bogland.  The
3007,--TERTULLIAN.,"track climbed high on one of the ridges of Sgurr Dearg, till it hung"
3008,--TERTULLIAN.,over a caldron of green glen with the Alt-na-Sidhe churning in its linn
3009,--TERTULLIAN.,"a thousand feet below.  It was a breathless evening, I remember, with a"
3010,--TERTULLIAN.,pale-blue sky just clearing from the haze of the day.  West-wind
3011,--TERTULLIAN.,"weather may make the North, even in September, no bad imitation of the"
3012,--TERTULLIAN.,"Tropics, and I sincerely pitied the man who all these stifling hours"
3013,--TERTULLIAN.,had been toiling on the screes of Sgurr Dearg.  By-and-by we sat down
3014,--TERTULLIAN.,"on a bank of heather, and idly watched the trough swimming at our feet."
3015,--TERTULLIAN.,"The clatter of the pony's hoofs grew fainter, the drone of bees had"
3016,--TERTULLIAN.,"gone, even the midges seemed to have forgotten their calling.  No place"
3017,--TERTULLIAN.,on earth can be so deathly still as a deer-forest early in the season
3018,--TERTULLIAN.,"before the stags have begun roaring, for there are no sheep with their"
3019,--TERTULLIAN.,"homely noises, and only the rare croak of a raven breaks the silence."
3020,--TERTULLIAN.,The hillside was far from sheer-one could have walked down with a
3021,--TERTULLIAN.,little care-but something in the shape of the hollow and the remote
3022,--TERTULLIAN.,gleam of white water gave it an extraordinary depth and space.  There
3023,--TERTULLIAN.,"was a shimmer left from the day's heat, which invested bracken and rock"
3024,--TERTULLIAN.,and scree with a curious airy unreality.  One could almost have
3025,--TERTULLIAN.,"believed that the eye had tricked the mind, that all was mirage, that"
3026,--TERTULLIAN.,five yards from the path the solid earth fell away into nothingness.  I
3027,--TERTULLIAN.,"have a bad head, and instinctively I drew farther back into the"
3028,--TERTULLIAN.,heather.  Leithen's eyes were looking vacantly before him.
3029,--TERTULLIAN.,
3030,--TERTULLIAN.,"""Did you ever know Hollond?"" he asked."
3031,--TERTULLIAN.,
3032,--TERTULLIAN.,"Then he laughed shortly.  ""I don't know why I asked that, but somehow"
3033,--TERTULLIAN.,this place reminded me of Hollond.  That glimmering hollow looks as if
3034,--TERTULLIAN.,it were the beginning of eternity.  It must be eerie to live with the
3035,--TERTULLIAN.,"feeling always on one."""
3036,--TERTULLIAN.,
3037,--TERTULLIAN.,Leithen seemed disinclined for further exercise.  He lit a pipe and
3038,--TERTULLIAN.,"smoked quietly for a little.  ""Odd that you didn't know Hollond.  You"
3039,--TERTULLIAN.,must have heard his name.  I thought you amused yourself with
3040,--TERTULLIAN.,"metaphysics."""
3041,--TERTULLIAN.,
3042,--TERTULLIAN.,Then I remembered.  There had been an erratic genius who had written
3043,--TERTULLIAN.,"some articles in Mind on that dreary subject, the mathematical"
3044,--TERTULLIAN.,"conception of infinity.  Men had praised them to me, but I confess I"
3045,--TERTULLIAN.,"never quite understood their argument.  ""Wasn't he some sort of"
3046,--TERTULLIAN.,"mathematical professor?""  I asked."
3047,--TERTULLIAN.,
3048,--TERTULLIAN.,"""He was, and, in his own way, a tremendous swell.  He wrote a book on"
3049,--TERTULLIAN.,Number which has translations in every European language.  He is dead
3050,--TERTULLIAN.,"now, and the Royal Society founded a medal in his honour.  But I wasn't"
3051,--TERTULLIAN.,"thinking of that side of him."""
3052,--TERTULLIAN.,
3053,--TERTULLIAN.,"It was the time and place for a story, for the pony would not be back"
3054,--TERTULLIAN.,for an hour.  So I asked Leithen about the other side of Hollond which
3055,--TERTULLIAN.,was recalled to him by Correi na Sidhe.  He seemed a little unwilling
3056,--TERTULLIAN.,to speak...
3057,--TERTULLIAN.,
3058,--TERTULLIAN.,"""I wonder if you will understand it.  You ought to, of course, better"
3059,--TERTULLIAN.,"than me, for you know something of philosophy.  But it took me a long"
3060,--TERTULLIAN.,"time to get the hang of it, and I can't give you any kind of"
3061,--TERTULLIAN.,"explanation.  He was my fag at Eton, and when I began to get on at the"
3062,--TERTULLIAN.,"Bar I was able to advise him on one or two private matters, so that he"
3063,--TERTULLIAN.,rather fancied my legal ability.  He came to me with his story because
3064,--TERTULLIAN.,"he had to tell someone, and he wouldn't trust a colleague.  He said he"
3065,--TERTULLIAN.,"didn't want a scientist to know, for scientists were either pledged to"
3066,--TERTULLIAN.,"their own theories and wouldn't understand, or, if they understood,"
3067,--TERTULLIAN.,"would get ahead of him in his researches.  He wanted a lawyer, he said,"
3068,--TERTULLIAN.,"who was accustomed to weighing evidence.  That was good sense, for"
3069,--TERTULLIAN.,"evidence must always be judged by the same laws, and I suppose in the"
3070,--TERTULLIAN.,long-run the most abstruse business comes down to a fairly simple
3071,--TERTULLIAN.,"deduction from certain data.  Anyhow, that was the way he used to talk,"
3072,--TERTULLIAN.,"and I listened to him, for I liked the man, and had an enormous respect"
3073,--TERTULLIAN.,for his brains.  At Eton he sluiced down all the mathematics they could
3074,--TERTULLIAN.,"give him, and he was an astonishing swell at Cambridge.  He was a"
3075,--TERTULLIAN.,"simple fellow, too, and talked no more jargon than he could help.  I"
3076,--TERTULLIAN.,"used to climb with him in the Alps now and then, and you would never"
3077,--TERTULLIAN.,have guessed that he had any thoughts beyond getting up steep rocks.
3078,--TERTULLIAN.,
3079,--TERTULLIAN.,"""It was at Chamonix, I remember, that I first got a hint of the matter"
3080,--TERTULLIAN.,"that was filling his mind.  We had been taking an off-day, and were"
3081,--TERTULLIAN.,"sitting in the hotel garden, watching the Aiguilles getting purple in"
3082,--TERTULLIAN.,the twilight.  Chamonix always makes me choke a little-it is so crushed
3083,--TERTULLIAN.,in by those great snow masses.  I said something about it--said I liked
3084,--TERTULLIAN.,the open spaces like the Gornegrat or the Bel Alp better.  He asked me
3085,--TERTULLIAN.,"why:  if it was the difference of the air, or merely the wider horizon?"
3086,--TERTULLIAN.,"I said it was the sense of not being crowded, of living in an empty"
3087,--TERTULLIAN.,world.  He repeated the word 'empty' and laughed.
3088,--TERTULLIAN.,
3089,--TERTULLIAN.,"""'By ""empty"" you mean,' he said, 'where things don't knock up against"
3090,--TERTULLIAN.,you?'
3091,--TERTULLIAN.,
3092,--TERTULLIAN.,"I told him No.  I mean just empty, void, nothing but blank aether."
3093,--TERTULLIAN.,
3094,--TERTULLIAN.,"""You don't knock up against things here, and the air is as good as you"
3095,--TERTULLIAN.,"want.  It can't be the lack of ordinary emptiness you feel."""
3096,--TERTULLIAN.,
3097,--TERTULLIAN.,"""I agreed that the word needed explaining.  'I suppose it is mental"
3098,--TERTULLIAN.,"restlessness,' I said.  'I like to feel that for a tremendous distance"
3099,--TERTULLIAN.,"there is nothing round me.  Why, I don't know.  Some men are built the"
3100,--TERTULLIAN.,other way and have a terror of space.'
3101,--TERTULLIAN.,
3102,--TERTULLIAN.,"""He said that that was better.  'It is a personal fancy, and depends on"
3103,--TERTULLIAN.,your KNOWING that there is nothing between you and the top of the Dent
3104,--TERTULLIAN.,Blanche.  And you know because your eyes tell you there is nothing.
3105,--TERTULLIAN.,"Even if you were blind, you might have a sort of sense about adjacent"
3106,--TERTULLIAN.,"matter.  Blind men often have it.  But in any case, whether got from"
3107,--TERTULLIAN.,"instinct or sight, the KNOWLEDGE is what matters.'"
3108,--TERTULLIAN.,
3109,--TERTULLIAN.,"""Hollond was embarking on a Socratic dialogue in which I could see"
3110,--TERTULLIAN.,"little point.  I told him so, and he laughed. ""'I am not sure that I am"
3111,--TERTULLIAN.,very clear myself.  But yes--there IS a point.  Supposing you knew-not
3112,--TERTULLIAN.,"by sight or by instinct, but by sheer intellectual knowledge, as I know"
3113,--TERTULLIAN.,the truth of a mathematical proposition--that what we call empty space
3114,--TERTULLIAN.,"was full, crammed.  Not with lumps of what we call matter like hills"
3115,--TERTULLIAN.,"and houses, but with things as real--as real to the mind.  Would you"
3116,--TERTULLIAN.,still feel crowded?'
3117,--TERTULLIAN.,
3118,--TERTULLIAN.,"""'No,' I said, 'I don't think so.  It is only what we call matter that"
3119,--TERTULLIAN.,signifies.  It would be just as well not to feel crowded by the other
3120,--TERTULLIAN.,"thing, for there would be no escape from it.  But what are you getting"
3121,--TERTULLIAN.,at?  Do you mean atoms or electric currents or what?'
3122,--TERTULLIAN.,
3123,--TERTULLIAN.,"""He said he wasn't thinking about that sort of thing, and began to talk"
3124,--TERTULLIAN.,of another subject.
3125,--TERTULLIAN.,
3126,--TERTULLIAN.,"""Next night, when we were pigging it at the Geant cabane, he started"
3127,--TERTULLIAN.,again on the same tack.  He asked me how I accounted for the fact that
3128,--TERTULLIAN.,animals could find their way back over great tracts of unknown country.
3129,--TERTULLIAN.,I said I supposed it was the homing instinct.
3130,--TERTULLIAN.,
3131,--TERTULLIAN.,"""'Rubbish, man,' he said.  'That's only another name for the puzzle,"
3132,--TERTULLIAN.,not an explanation.  There must be some reason for it.  They must KNOW
3133,--TERTULLIAN.,something that we cannot understand.  Tie a cat in a bag and take it
3134,--TERTULLIAN.,fifty miles by train and it will make its way home.  That cat has some
3135,--TERTULLIAN.,clue that we haven't.'
3136,--TERTULLIAN.,
3137,--TERTULLIAN.,"""I was tired and sleepy, and told him that I did not care a rush about"
3138,--TERTULLIAN.,"the psychology of cats.  But he was not to be snubbed, and went on"
3139,--TERTULLIAN.,talking.
3140,--TERTULLIAN.,
3141,--TERTULLIAN.,"""'How if Space is really full of things we cannot see and as yet do not"
3142,--TERTULLIAN.,know?  How if all animals and some savages have a cell in their brain
3143,--TERTULLIAN.,or a nerve which responds to the invisible world?  How if all Space be
3144,--TERTULLIAN.,"full of these landmarks, not material in our sense, but quite real?  A"
3145,--TERTULLIAN.,"dog barks at nothing, a wild beast makes an aimless circuit.  Why?"
3146,--TERTULLIAN.,"Perhaps because Space is made up of corridors and alleys, ways to"
3147,--TERTULLIAN.,"travel and things to shun?  For all we know, to a greater intelligence"
3148,--TERTULLIAN.,than ours the top of Mont Blanc may be as crowded as Piccadilly Circus.'
3149,--TERTULLIAN.,
3150,--TERTULLIAN.,"""But at that point I fell asleep and left Hollond to repeat his"
3151,--TERTULLIAN.,questions to a guide who knew no English and a snoring porter.
3152,--TERTULLIAN.,
3153,--TERTULLIAN.,"""Six months later, one foggy January afternoon, Hollond rang me up at"
3154,--TERTULLIAN.,the Temple and proposed to come to see me that night after dinner.  I
3155,--TERTULLIAN.,"thought he wanted to talk Alpine shop, but he turned up in Duke Street"
3156,--TERTULLIAN.,about nine with a kit-bag full of papers.  He was an odd fellow to look
3157,--TERTULLIAN.,"at--a yellowish face with the skin stretched tight on the cheek-bones,"
3158,--TERTULLIAN.,"clean-shaven, a sharp chin which he kept poking forward, and deep-set,"
3159,--TERTULLIAN.,"greyish eyes.  He was a hard fellow, too, always in pretty good"
3160,--TERTULLIAN.,"condition, which was remarkable considering how he slaved for nine"
3161,--TERTULLIAN.,"months out of the twelve.  He had a quiet, slow-spoken manner, but that"
3162,--TERTULLIAN.,night I saw that he was considerably excited.
3163,--TERTULLIAN.,
3164,--TERTULLIAN.,"""He said that he had come to me because we were old friends.  He"
3165,--TERTULLIAN.,proposed to tell me a tremendous secret.  'I must get another mind to
3166,--TERTULLIAN.,work on it or I'll go crazy.  I don't want a scientist.  I want a plain
3167,--TERTULLIAN.,man.'
3168,--TERTULLIAN.,
3169,--TERTULLIAN.,"""Then he fixed me with a look like a tragic actor's.  'Do you remember"
3170,--TERTULLIAN.,that talk we had in August at Chamonix--about Space?  I daresay you
3171,--TERTULLIAN.,"thought I was playing the fool.  So I was in a sense, but I was feeling"
3172,--TERTULLIAN.,my way towards something which has been in my mind for ten years.  Now
3173,--TERTULLIAN.,"I have got it, and you must hear about it.  You may take my word that"
3174,--TERTULLIAN.,it's a pretty startling discovery.'
3175,--TERTULLIAN.,
3176,--TERTULLIAN.,"""I lit a pipe and told him to go ahead, warning him that I knew about"
3177,--TERTULLIAN.,as much science as the dustman.
3178,--TERTULLIAN.,
3179,--TERTULLIAN.,"""I am bound to say that it took me a long time to understand what he"
3180,--TERTULLIAN.,meant.  He began by saying that everybody thought of Space as an 'empty
3181,--TERTULLIAN.,homogeneous medium.'  'Never mind at present what the ultimate
3182,--TERTULLIAN.,"constituents of that medium are.  We take it as a finished product, and"
3183,--TERTULLIAN.,"we think of it as mere extension, something without any quality at all."
3184,--TERTULLIAN.,That is the view of civilised man.  You will find all the philosophers
3185,--TERTULLIAN.,"taking it for granted.  Yes, but every living thing does not take that"
3186,--TERTULLIAN.,"view.  An animal, for instance.  It feels a kind of quality in Space."
3187,--TERTULLIAN.,"It can find its way over new country, because it perceives certain"
3188,--TERTULLIAN.,"landmarks, not necessarily material, but perceptible, or if you like"
3189,--TERTULLIAN.,"intelligible.  Take an Australian savage.  He has the same power, and,"
3190,--TERTULLIAN.,"I believe, for the same reason.  He is conscious of intelligible"
3191,--TERTULLIAN.,landmarks.'
3192,--TERTULLIAN.,
3193,--TERTULLIAN.,"""'You mean what people call a sense of direction,' I put in."
3194,--TERTULLIAN.,
3195,--TERTULLIAN.,"""'Yes, but what in Heaven's name is a sense of direction?  The phrase"
3196,--TERTULLIAN.,explains nothing.  However incoherent the mind of the animal or the
3197,--TERTULLIAN.,"savage may be, it is there somewhere, working on some data.  I've been"
3198,--TERTULLIAN.,"all through the psychological and anthropological side of the business,"
3199,--TERTULLIAN.,and after you eliminate the clues from sight and hearing and smell and
3200,--TERTULLIAN.,half-conscious memory there remains a solid lump of the inexplicable.'
3201,--TERTULLIAN.,
3202,--TERTULLIAN.,"""Hollond's eye had kindled, and he sat doubled up in his chair,"
3203,--TERTULLIAN.,dominating me with a finger.
3204,--TERTULLIAN.,
3205,--TERTULLIAN.,"""'Here, then is a power which man is civilising himself out of.  Call"
3206,--TERTULLIAN.,"it anything you like, but you must admit that it is a power.  Don't you"
3207,--TERTULLIAN.,see that it is a perception of another kind of reality that we are
3208,--TERTULLIAN.,"leaving behind us?... Well, you know the way nature works.  The wheel"
3209,--TERTULLIAN.,"comes full circle, and what we think we have lost we regain in a higher"
3210,--TERTULLIAN.,form.  So for a long time I have been wondering whether the civilised
3211,--TERTULLIAN.,"mind could not recreate for itself this lost gift, the gift of seeing"
3212,--TERTULLIAN.,the quality of Space.  I mean that I wondered whether the scientific
3213,--TERTULLIAN.,modern brain could not get to the stage of realising that Space is not
3214,--TERTULLIAN.,"an empty homogeneous medium, but full of intricate differences,"
3215,--TERTULLIAN.,"intelligible and real, though not with our common reality.'"
3216,--TERTULLIAN.,
3217,--TERTULLIAN.,"""I found all this very puzzling and he had to repeat it several times"
3218,--TERTULLIAN.,before I got a glimpse of what he was talking about.
3219,--TERTULLIAN.,
3220,--TERTULLIAN.,"""'I've wondered for a long time he went on 'but now quite suddenly, I"
3221,--TERTULLIAN.,have begun to know.' He stopped and asked me abruptly if I knew much
3222,--TERTULLIAN.,about mathematics.
3223,--TERTULLIAN.,
3224,--TERTULLIAN.,"""'It's a pity,' he said,'but the main point is not technical, though I"
3225,--TERTULLIAN.,wish you could appreciate the beauty of some of my proofs.  Then he
3226,--TERTULLIAN.,began to tell me about his last six months' work.  I should have
3227,--TERTULLIAN.,mentioned that he was a brilliant physicist besides other things.  All
3228,--TERTULLIAN.,"Hollond's tastes were on the borderlands of sciences, where mathematics"
3229,--TERTULLIAN.,fades into metaphysics and physics merges in the abstrusest kind of
3230,--TERTULLIAN.,"mathematics.  Well, it seems he had been working for years at the"
3231,--TERTULLIAN.,"ultimate problem of matter, and especially of that rarefied matter we"
3232,--TERTULLIAN.,call aether or space.  I forget what his view was--atoms or molecules or
3233,--TERTULLIAN.,"electric waves.  If he ever told me I have forgotten, but I'm not"
3234,--TERTULLIAN.,"certain that I ever knew.  However, the point was that these ultimate"
3235,--TERTULLIAN.,"constituents were dynamic and mobile, not a mere passive medium but a"
3236,--TERTULLIAN.,medium in constant movement and change.  He claimed to have
3237,--TERTULLIAN.,discovered--by ordinary inductive experiment--that the constituents of
3238,--TERTULLIAN.,"aether possessed certain functions, and moved in certain figures"
3239,--TERTULLIAN.,"obedient to certain mathematical laws.  Space, I gathered, was"
3240,--TERTULLIAN.,perpetually 'forming fours' in some fancy way.
3241,--TERTULLIAN.,
3242,--TERTULLIAN.,"""Here he left his physics and became the mathematician.  Among his"
3243,--TERTULLIAN.,mathematical discoveries had been certain curves or figures or
3244,--TERTULLIAN.,something whose behaviour involved a new dimension.  I gathered that
3245,--TERTULLIAN.,"this wasn't the ordinary Fourth Dimension that people talk of, but that"
3246,--TERTULLIAN.,fourth-dimensional inwardness or involution was part of it.  The
3247,--TERTULLIAN.,"explanation lay in the pile of manuscripts he left with me, but though"
3248,--TERTULLIAN.,I tried honestly I couldn't get the hang of it.  My mathematics stopped
3249,--TERTULLIAN.,with desperate finality just as he got into his subject.
3250,--TERTULLIAN.,
3251,--TERTULLIAN.,"""His point was that the constituents of Space moved according to these"
3252,--TERTULLIAN.,"new mathematical figures of his.  They were always changing, but the"
3253,--TERTULLIAN.,principles of their change were as fixed as the law of gravitation.
3254,--TERTULLIAN.,"Therefore, if you once grasped these principles you knew the contents"
3255,--TERTULLIAN.,"of the void.  What do you make of that?"""
3256,--TERTULLIAN.,
3257,--TERTULLIAN.,"I said that it seemed to me a reasonable enough argument, but that it"
3258,--TERTULLIAN.,"got one very little way forward. ""A man,""  I said, ""might know the"
3259,--TERTULLIAN.,contents of Space and the laws of their arrangement and yet be unable
3260,--TERTULLIAN.,to see anything more than his fellows.  It is a purely academic
3261,--TERTULLIAN.,"knowledge.  His mind knows it as the result of many deductions, but his"
3262,--TERTULLIAN.,"senses perceive nothing."""
3263,--TERTULLIAN.,
3264,--TERTULLIAN.,"Leithen laughed.  ""Just what I said to Hollond.  He asked the opinion"
3265,--TERTULLIAN.,of my legal mind.  I said I could not pronounce on his argument but
3266,--TERTULLIAN.,that I could point out that he had established no trait d'union between
3267,--TERTULLIAN.,the intellect which understood and the senses which perceived.  It was
3268,--TERTULLIAN.,"like a blind man with immense knowledge but no eyes, and therefore no"
3269,--TERTULLIAN.,peg to hang his knowledge on and make it useful.  He had not explained
3270,--TERTULLIAN.,"his savage or his cat.  'Hang it, man,' I said, 'before you can"
3271,--TERTULLIAN.,appreciate the existence of your Spacial forms you have to go through
3272,--TERTULLIAN.,elaborate experiments and deductions.  You can't be doing that every
3273,--TERTULLIAN.,minute.  Therefore you don't get any nearer to the USE of the sense you
3274,--TERTULLIAN.,"say that man once possessed, though you can explain it a bit.'"""
3275,--TERTULLIAN.,
3276,--TERTULLIAN.,"""What did he say?"" I asked."
3277,--TERTULLIAN.,
3278,--TERTULLIAN.,"""The funny thing was that he never seemed to see my difficulty.  When I"
3279,--TERTULLIAN.,kept bringing him back to it he shied off with a new wild theory of
3280,--TERTULLIAN.,perception.  He argued that the mind can live in a world of realities
3281,--TERTULLIAN.,without any sensuous stimulus to connect them with the world of our
3282,--TERTULLIAN.,ordinary life.  Of course that wasn't my point.  I supposed that this
3283,--TERTULLIAN.,"world of Space was real enough to him, but I wanted to know how he got"
3284,--TERTULLIAN.,"there.  He never answered me.  He was the typical Cambridge man, you"
3285,--TERTULLIAN.,"know--dogmatic about uncertainties, but curiously diffident about the"
3286,--TERTULLIAN.,obvious.  He laboured to get me to understand the notion of his
3287,--TERTULLIAN.,"mathematical forms, which I was quite willing to take on trust from"
3288,--TERTULLIAN.,"him.  Some queer things he said, too.  He took our feeling about Left"
3289,--TERTULLIAN.,and Right as an example of our instinct for the quality of Space.  But
3290,--TERTULLIAN.,"when I objected that Left and Right varied with each object, and only"
3291,--TERTULLIAN.,"existed in connection with some definite material thing, he said that"
3292,--TERTULLIAN.,that was exactly what he meant.  It was an example of the mobility of
3293,--TERTULLIAN.,"the Spacial forms.  Do you see any sense in that?"""
3294,--TERTULLIAN.,
3295,--TERTULLIAN.,I shook my head.  It seemed to me pure craziness.
3296,--TERTULLIAN.,
3297,--TERTULLIAN.,"""And then he tried to show me what he called the 'involution of Space,'"
3298,--TERTULLIAN.,by taking two points on a piece of paper.  The points were a foot away
3299,--TERTULLIAN.,"when the paper was flat, they coincided when it was doubled up.  He"
3300,--TERTULLIAN.,"said that there were no gaps between the figures, for the medium was"
3301,--TERTULLIAN.,"continuous, and he took as an illustration the loops on a cord.  You"
3302,--TERTULLIAN.,are to think of a cord always looping and unlooping itself according to
3303,--TERTULLIAN.,"certain mathematical laws.  Oh, I tell you, I gave up trying to follow"
3304,--TERTULLIAN.,him.  And he was so desperately in earnest all the time.  By his
3305,--TERTULLIAN.,"account Space was a sort of mathematical pandemonium."""
3306,--TERTULLIAN.,
3307,--TERTULLIAN.,"Leithen stopped to refill his pipe, and I mused upon the ironic fate"
3308,--TERTULLIAN.,which had compelled a mathematical genius to make his sole confidant of
3309,--TERTULLIAN.,"a philistine lawyer, and induced that lawyer to repeat it confusedly to"
3310,--TERTULLIAN.,an ignoramus at twilight on a Scotch hill.  As told by Leithen it was a
3311,--TERTULLIAN.,very halting tale.
3312,--TERTULLIAN.,
3313,--TERTULLIAN.,"""But there was one thing I could see very clearly,"" Leithen went on,"
3314,--TERTULLIAN.,"""and that was Hollond's own case.  This crowded world of Space was"
3315,--TERTULLIAN.,perfectly real to him.  How he had got to it I do not know.  Perhaps
3316,--TERTULLIAN.,"his mind, dwelling constantly on the problem, had unsealed some"
3317,--TERTULLIAN.,"atrophied cell and restored the old instinct.  Anyhow, he was living"
3318,--TERTULLIAN.,his daily life with a foot in each world.
3319,--TERTULLIAN.,
3320,--TERTULLIAN.,"""He often came to see me, and after the first hectic discussions he"
3321,--TERTULLIAN.,didn't talk much.  There was no noticeable change in him--a little more
3322,--TERTULLIAN.,abstracted perhaps.  He would walk in the street or come into a room
3323,--TERTULLIAN.,"with a quick look round him, and sometimes for no earthly reason he"
3324,--TERTULLIAN.,would swerve.  Did you ever watch a cat crossing a room?  It sidles
3325,--TERTULLIAN.,along by the furniture and walks over an open space of carpet as if it
3326,--TERTULLIAN.,"were picking its way among obstacles.  Well, Hollond behaved like that,"
3327,--TERTULLIAN.,"but he had always been counted a little odd, and nobody noticed it but"
3328,--TERTULLIAN.,me.
3329,--TERTULLIAN.,
3330,--TERTULLIAN.,"""I knew better than to chaff him, and had stopped argument, so there"
3331,--TERTULLIAN.,wasn't much to be said.  But sometimes he would give me news about his
3332,--TERTULLIAN.,experiences.  The whole thing was perfectly clear and scientific and
3333,--TERTULLIAN.,"above board, and nothing creepy about it.  You know how I hate the"
3334,--TERTULLIAN.,washy supernatural stuff they give us nowadays.  Hollond was well and
3335,--TERTULLIAN.,"fit, with an appetite like a hunter.  But as he talked,"
3336,--TERTULLIAN.,"sometimes--well, you know I haven't much in the way of nerves or"
3337,--TERTULLIAN.,imagination--but I used to get a little eerie.  Used to feel the solid
3338,--TERTULLIAN.,"earth dissolving round me.  It was the opposite of vertigo, if you"
3339,--TERTULLIAN.,understand me--a sense of airy realities crowding in on you-crowding
3340,--TERTULLIAN.,"the mind, that is, not the body."
3341,--TERTULLIAN.,
3342,--TERTULLIAN.,"""I gathered from Hollond that he was always conscious of corridors and"
3343,--TERTULLIAN.,"halls and alleys in Space, shifting, but shifting according to"
3344,--TERTULLIAN.,inexorable laws.  I never could get quite clear as to what this
3345,--TERTULLIAN.,consciousness was like.  When I asked he used to look puzzled and
3346,--TERTULLIAN.,worried and helpless.  I made out from him that one landmark involved a
3347,--TERTULLIAN.,"sequence, and once given a bearing from an object you could keep the"
3348,--TERTULLIAN.,"direction without a mistake.  He told me he could easily, if he wanted,"
3349,--TERTULLIAN.,go in a dirigible from the top of Mont Blanc to the top of Snowdon in
3350,--TERTULLIAN.,"the thickest fog and without a compass, if he were given the proper"
3351,--TERTULLIAN.,angle to start from.  I confess I didn't follow that myself.  Material
3352,--TERTULLIAN.,"objects had nothing to do with the Spacial forms, for a table or a bed"
3353,--TERTULLIAN.,in our world might be placed across a corridor of Space.  The forms
3354,--TERTULLIAN.,played their game independent of our kind of reality.  But the worst of
3355,--TERTULLIAN.,"it was, that if you kept your mind too much in one world you were apt"
3356,--TERTULLIAN.,to forget about the other and Hollond was always barking his shins on
3357,--TERTULLIAN.,stones and chairs and things.
3358,--TERTULLIAN.,
3359,--TERTULLIAN.,"""He told me all this quite simply and frankly.  Remember his mind and"
3360,--TERTULLIAN.,no other part of him lived in his new world.  He said it gave him an
3361,--TERTULLIAN.,"odd sense of detachment to sit in a room among people, and to know that"
3362,--TERTULLIAN.,nothing there but himself had any relation at all to the infinite
3363,--TERTULLIAN.,"strange world of Space that flowed around them.  He would listen, he"
3364,--TERTULLIAN.,"said, to a great man talking, with one eye on the cat on the rug,"
3365,--TERTULLIAN.,"thinking to himself how much more the cat knew than the man."""
3366,--TERTULLIAN.,
3367,--TERTULLIAN.,"""How long was it before he went mad?""  I asked."
3368,--TERTULLIAN.,
3369,--TERTULLIAN.,"It was a foolish question, and made Leithen cross.  ""He never went mad"
3370,--TERTULLIAN.,"in your sense.  My dear fellow, you're very much wrong if you think"
3371,--TERTULLIAN.,there was anything pathological about him--then.  The man was
3372,--TERTULLIAN.,brilliantly sane.  His mind was as keen is a keen sword.  I couldn't
3373,--TERTULLIAN.,"understand him, but I could judge of his sanity right enough."""
3374,--TERTULLIAN.,
3375,--TERTULLIAN.,I asked if it made him happy or miserable.
3376,--TERTULLIAN.,
3377,--TERTULLIAN.,"""At first I think it made him uncomfortable.  He was restless because"
3378,--TERTULLIAN.,he knew too much and too little.  The unknown pressed in on his mind as
3379,--TERTULLIAN.,bad air weighs on the lungs.  Then it lightened and he accepted the new
3380,--TERTULLIAN.,world in the same sober practical way that he took other things.  I
3381,--TERTULLIAN.,think that the free exercise of his mind in a pure medium gave him a
3382,--TERTULLIAN.,feeling of extraordinary power and ease.  His eyes used to sparkle when
3383,--TERTULLIAN.,he talked.  And another odd thing he told me.  He was a keen
3384,--TERTULLIAN.,"rockclimber, but, curiously enough, he had never a very good head."
3385,--TERTULLIAN.,"Dizzy heights always worried him, though he managed to keep hold on"
3386,--TERTULLIAN.,himself.  But now all that had gone.  The sense of the fulness of Space
3387,--TERTULLIAN.,made him as happy--happier I believe--with his legs dangling into
3388,--TERTULLIAN.,"eternity, as sitting before his own study fire."
3389,--TERTULLIAN.,
3390,--TERTULLIAN.,"""I remember saying that it was all rather like the mediaeval wizards"
3391,--TERTULLIAN.,who made their spells by means of numbers and figures.
3392,--TERTULLIAN.,
3393,--TERTULLIAN.,"""He caught me up at once.  'Not numbers,' he said.  ""Number has no"
3394,--TERTULLIAN.,place in Nature.  It is an invention of the human mind to atone for a
3395,--TERTULLIAN.,bad memory.  But figures are a different matter.  All the mysteries of
3396,--TERTULLIAN.,"the world are in them, and the old magicians knew that at least, if"
3397,--TERTULLIAN.,they knew no more.'
3398,--TERTULLIAN.,
3399,--TERTULLIAN.,"""He had only one grievance.  He complained that it was terribly lonely."
3400,--TERTULLIAN.,"'It is the Desolation,' he would quote, 'spoken of by Daniel the"
3401,--TERTULLIAN.,prophet.' He would spend hours travelling those eerie shifting
3402,--TERTULLIAN.,corridors of Space with no hint of another human soul.  How could there
3403,--TERTULLIAN.,"be?  It was a world of pure reason, where human personality had no"
3404,--TERTULLIAN.,place. What puzzled me was why he should feel the absence of this.  One
3405,--TERTULLIAN.,"wouldn't you know, in an intricate problem of geometry or a game of"
3406,--TERTULLIAN.,"chess.  I asked him, but he didn't understand the question.  I puzzled"
3407,--TERTULLIAN.,"over it a good deal, for it seemed to me that if Hollond felt lonely,"
3408,--TERTULLIAN.,there must be more in this world of his than we imagined.  I began to
3409,--TERTULLIAN.,"wonder if there was any truth in fads like psychical research.  Also, I"
3410,--TERTULLIAN.,was not so sure that he was as normal as I had thought:  it looked as
3411,--TERTULLIAN.,if his nerves might be going bad.
3412,--TERTULLIAN.,
3413,--TERTULLIAN.,"""Oddly enough, Hollond was getting on the same track himself.  He had"
3414,--TERTULLIAN.,"discovered, so he said, that in sleep everybody now and then lived in"
3415,--TERTULLIAN.,this new world of his.  You know how one dreams of triangular railway
3416,--TERTULLIAN.,platforms with trains running simultaneously down all three sides and
3417,--TERTULLIAN.,"not colliding.  Well, this sort of cantrip was 'common form,' as we say"
3418,--TERTULLIAN.,"at the Bar, in Hollond's Space, and he was very curious about the why"
3419,--TERTULLIAN.,"and wherefore of Sleep.  He began to haunt psychological laboratories,"
3420,--TERTULLIAN.,"where they experiment with the charwoman and the odd man, and he used"
3421,--TERTULLIAN.,"to go up to Cambridge for seances.  It was a foreign atmosphere to him,"
3422,--TERTULLIAN.,and I don't think he was very happy in it.  He found so many charlatans
3423,--TERTULLIAN.,"that he used to get angry, and declare he would be better employed at"
3424,--TERTULLIAN.,"Mother's Meetings!"""
3425,--TERTULLIAN.,
3426,--TERTULLIAN.,From far up the Glen came the sound of the pony's hoofs.  The stag had
3427,--TERTULLIAN.,been loaded up and the gillies were returning.  Leithen looked at his
3428,--TERTULLIAN.,"watch.  ""We'd better wait and see the beast,"" he said."
3429,--TERTULLIAN.,
3430,--TERTULLIAN.,"""... Well, nothing happened for more than a year.  Then one evening in"
3431,--TERTULLIAN.,May he burst into my rooms in high excitement.  You understand quite
3432,--TERTULLIAN.,clearly that there was no suspicion of horror or fright or anything
3433,--TERTULLIAN.,unpleasant about this world he had discovered.  It was simply a series
3434,--TERTULLIAN.,of interesting and difficult problems.  All this time Hollond had been
3435,--TERTULLIAN.,rather extra well and cheery.  But when he came in I thought I noticed
3436,--TERTULLIAN.,"a different look in his eyes, something puzzled and diffident and"
3437,--TERTULLIAN.,apprehensive.
3438,--TERTULLIAN.,
3439,--TERTULLIAN.,"""'There's a queer performance going on in the other world,' he said."
3440,--TERTULLIAN.,'It's unbelievable.  I never dreamed of such a thing.  I--I don't
3441,--TERTULLIAN.,"quite know how to put it, and I don't know how to explain it, but--but"
3442,--TERTULLIAN.,I am becoming aware that there are other beings--other minds--moving
3443,--TERTULLIAN.,in Space besides mine.'
3444,--TERTULLIAN.,
3445,--TERTULLIAN.,"""I suppose I ought to have realised then that things were beginning to"
3446,--TERTULLIAN.,"go wrong.  But it was very difficult, he was so rational and anxious to"
3447,--TERTULLIAN.,"make it all clear.  I asked him how he knew.  'There could, of course,"
3448,--TERTULLIAN.,"on his own showing be no CHANGE in that world, for the forms of Space"
3449,--TERTULLIAN.,moved and existed under inexorable laws.  He said he found his own mind
3450,--TERTULLIAN.,failing him at points.  There would come over him a sense of
3451,--TERTULLIAN.,"fear--intellectual fear--and weakness, a sense of something else, quite"
3452,--TERTULLIAN.,"alien to Space, thwarting him.  Of course he could only describe his"
3453,--TERTULLIAN.,"impressions very lamely, for they were purely of the mind, and he had"
3454,--TERTULLIAN.,"no material peg to hang them on, so that I could realise them.  But the"
3455,--TERTULLIAN.,gist of it was that he had been gradually becoming conscious of what he
3456,--TERTULLIAN.,called 'Presences' in his world.  They had no effect on Space--did not
3457,--TERTULLIAN.,"leave footprints in its corridors, for instance--but they affected his"
3458,--TERTULLIAN.,mind.  There was some mysterious contact established between him and
3459,--TERTULLIAN.,"them.  I asked him if the affection was unpleasant and he said 'No, not"
3460,--TERTULLIAN.,exactly.' But I could see a hint of fear in his eyes.
3461,--TERTULLIAN.,
3462,--TERTULLIAN.,"""Think of it.  Try to realise what intellectual fear is.  I can't, but"
3463,--TERTULLIAN.,it is conceivable.  To you and me fear implies pain to ourselves or
3464,--TERTULLIAN.,"some other, and such pain is always in the last resort pain of the"
3465,--TERTULLIAN.,flesh.  Consider it carefully and you will see that it is so.  But
3466,--TERTULLIAN.,imagine fear so sublimated and transmuted as to be the tension of pure
3467,--TERTULLIAN.,"spirit.  I can't realise it, but I think it possible.  I don't pretend"
3468,--TERTULLIAN.,to understand how Hollond got to know about these Presences.  But there
3469,--TERTULLIAN.,"was no doubt about the fact.  He was positive, and he wasn't in the"
3470,--TERTULLIAN.,least mad--not in our sense.  In that very month he published his book
3471,--TERTULLIAN.,"on Number, and gave a German professor who attacked it a most"
3472,--TERTULLIAN.,tremendous public trouncing.
3473,--TERTULLIAN.,
3474,--TERTULLIAN.,"""I know what you are going to say,--that the fancy was a weakening of"
3475,--TERTULLIAN.,the mind from within.  I admit I should have thought of that but he
3476,--TERTULLIAN.,looked so confoundedly sane and able that it seemed ridiculous.  He
3477,--TERTULLIAN.,"kept asking me my opinion, as a lawyer, on the facts he offered.  It"
3478,--TERTULLIAN.,"was the oddest case ever put before me, but I did my best for him.  I"
3479,--TERTULLIAN.,"dropped all my own views of sense and nonsense.  I told him that,"
3480,--TERTULLIAN.,"taking all that he had told me as fact, the Presences might be either"
3481,--TERTULLIAN.,ordinary minds traversing Space in sleep; or minds such as his which
3482,--TERTULLIAN.,"had independently captured the sense of Space's quality; or, finally,"
3483,--TERTULLIAN.,"the spirits of just men made perfect, behaving as psychical researchers"
3484,--TERTULLIAN.,"think they do.  It was a ridiculous task to set a prosaic man, and I"
3485,--TERTULLIAN.,wasn't quite serious.  But Holland was serious enough.
3486,--TERTULLIAN.,
3487,--TERTULLIAN.,"""He admitted that all three explanations were conceivable, but he was"
3488,--TERTULLIAN.,very doubtful about the first.  The projection of the spirit into Space
3489,--TERTULLIAN.,"during sleep, he thought, was a faint and feeble thing, and these were"
3490,--TERTULLIAN.,powerful Presences.  With the second and the third he was rather
3491,--TERTULLIAN.,impressed.  I suppose I should have seen what was happening and tried
3492,--TERTULLIAN.,"to stop it; at least, looking back that seems to have been my duty."
3493,--TERTULLIAN.,But it was difficult to think that anything was wrong with Hollond;
3494,--TERTULLIAN.,indeed the odd thing is that all this time the idea of madness never
3495,--TERTULLIAN.,entered my head.  I rather backed him up.  Somehow the thing took my
3496,--TERTULLIAN.,"fancy, though I thought it moonshine at the bottom of my heart.  I"
3497,--TERTULLIAN.,"enlarged on the pioneering before him.  'Think,' I told him, 'what may"
3498,--TERTULLIAN.,be waiting for you.  You may discover the meaning of Spirit.  You may
3499,--TERTULLIAN.,"open up a new world, as rich as the old one, but imperishable.  You may"
3500,--TERTULLIAN.,prove to mankind their immortality and deliver them for ever from the
3501,--TERTULLIAN.,"fear of death.  Why, man, you are picking at the lock of all the"
3502,--TERTULLIAN.,world's mysteries.'
3503,--TERTULLIAN.,
3504,--TERTULLIAN.,"""But Hollond did not cheer up.  He seemed strangely languid and"
3505,--TERTULLIAN.,"dispirited.  'That is all true enough,' he said,'if you are right, if"
3506,--TERTULLIAN.,"your alternatives are exhaustive.  But suppose they are something else,"
3507,--TERTULLIAN.,something .... What that 'something' might be he had apparently no
3508,--TERTULLIAN.,"idea, and very soon he went away."
3509,--TERTULLIAN.,
3510,--TERTULLIAN.,"""He said another thing before he left.  We asked me if I ever read"
3511,--TERTULLIAN.,"poetry, and I said, not often.  Nor did he:  but he had picked up a"
3512,--TERTULLIAN.,little book somewhere and found a man who knew about the Presences.  I
3513,--TERTULLIAN.,"think his name was Traherne, one of the seventeenth-century fellows."
3514,--TERTULLIAN.,He quoted a verse which stuck to my fly-paper memory.  It ran something
3515,--TERTULLIAN.,like
3516,--TERTULLIAN.,
3517,--TERTULLIAN.,"'Within the region of the air,"
3518,--TERTULLIAN.,"Compassed about with Heavens fair,"
3519,--TERTULLIAN.,"Great tracts of lands there may be found,"
3520,--TERTULLIAN.,"Where many numerous hosts,"
3521,--TERTULLIAN.,"In those far distant coasts,"
3522,--TERTULLIAN.,For other great and glorious ends
3523,--TERTULLIAN.,"Inhabit, my yet unknown friends.'"
3524,--TERTULLIAN.,
3525,--TERTULLIAN.,Hollond was positive he did not mean angels or anything of the sort.  I
3526,--TERTULLIAN.,told him that Traherne evidently took a cheerful view of them.  He
3527,--TERTULLIAN.,"admitted that, but added: 'He had religion, you see.  He believed that"
3528,--TERTULLIAN.,"everything was for the best.  I am not a man of faith, and can only"
3529,--TERTULLIAN.,"take comfort from what I understand.  I'm in the dark, I tell you...'"
3530,--TERTULLIAN.,
3531,--TERTULLIAN.,"""Next week I was busy with the Chilian Arbitration case, and saw nobody"
3532,--TERTULLIAN.,for a couple of months.  Then one evening I ran against Hollond on the
3533,--TERTULLIAN.,"Embankment, and thought him looking horribly ill.  He walked back with"
3534,--TERTULLIAN.,"me to my rooms, and hardly uttered one word all the way.  I gave him a"
3535,--TERTULLIAN.,"stiff whisky-and-soda, which he gulped down absent-mindedly.  There was"
3536,--TERTULLIAN.,"that strained, hunted look in his eyes that you see in a frightened"
3537,--TERTULLIAN.,"animal's.  He was always lean, but now he had fallen away to skin and"
3538,--TERTULLIAN.,bone.
3539,--TERTULLIAN.,
3540,--TERTULLIAN.,"""'I can't stay long,' he told me, 'for I'm off to the Alps to-morrow"
3541,--TERTULLIAN.,and I have a lot to do.'  Before then he used to plunge readily into
3542,--TERTULLIAN.,"his story, but now he seemed shy about beginning.  Indeed I had to ask"
3543,--TERTULLIAN.,him a question.
3544,--TERTULLIAN.,
3545,--TERTULLIAN.,"""'Things are difficult,' he said hesitatingly, and rather distressing."
3546,--TERTULLIAN.,"Do you know, Leithen, I think you were wrong about--about what I spoke"
3547,--TERTULLIAN.,to you of.  You said there must be one of three explanations.  I am
3548,--TERTULLIAN.,beginning to think that there is a fourth.
3549,--TERTULLIAN.,
3550,--TERTULLIAN.,"""He stopped for a second or two, then suddenly leaned forward and"
3551,--TERTULLIAN.,gripped my knee so fiercely that I cried out.  'That world is the
3552,--TERTULLIAN.,"Desolation,' he said in a choking voice, 'and perhaps I am getting near"
3553,--TERTULLIAN.,the Abomination of the Desolation that the old prophet spoke of.  I
3554,--TERTULLIAN.,"tell you, man, I am on the edge of a terror, a terror,' he almost"
3555,--TERTULLIAN.,"screamed, 'that no mortal can think of and live.'"
3556,--TERTULLIAN.,
3557,--TERTULLIAN.,You can imagine that I was considerably startled.  It was lightning out
3558,--TERTULLIAN.,of a clear sky.  How the devil could one associate horror with
3559,--TERTULLIAN.,"mathematics?  I don't see it yet...  At any rate, I--You may be sure I"
3560,--TERTULLIAN.,cursed my folly for ever pretending to take him seriously.  The only
3561,--TERTULLIAN.,way would have been to have laughed him out of it at the start.  And
3562,--TERTULLIAN.,"yet I couldn't, you know--it was too real and reasonable.  Anyhow, I"
3563,--TERTULLIAN.,"tried a firm tone now, and told him the whole thing was arrant raving"
3564,--TERTULLIAN.,bosh.  I bade him be a man and pull himself together.  I made him dine
3565,--TERTULLIAN.,"with me, and took him home, and got him into a better state of mind"
3566,--TERTULLIAN.,"before he went to bed.  Next morning I saw him off at Charing Cross,"
3567,--TERTULLIAN.,"very haggard still, but better. He promised to write to me pretty"
3568,--TERTULLIAN.,often....
3569,--TERTULLIAN.,
3570,--TERTULLIAN.,
3571,--TERTULLIAN.,"The pony, with a great eleven-pointer lurching athwart its back, was"
3572,--TERTULLIAN.,"abreast of us, and from the autumn mist came the sound of soft Highland"
3573,--TERTULLIAN.,"voices.  Leithen and I got up to go, when we heard that the rifle had"
3574,--TERTULLIAN.,made direct for the Lodge by a short cut past the Sanctuary.  In the
3575,--TERTULLIAN.,wake of the gillies we descended the Correi road into a glen all
3576,--TERTULLIAN.,swimming with dim purple shadows.  The pony minced and boggled; the
3577,--TERTULLIAN.,"stag's antlers stood out sharp on the rise against a patch of sky,"
3578,--TERTULLIAN.,looking like a skeleton tree.  Then we dropped into a covert of birches
3579,--TERTULLIAN.,and emerged on the white glen highway.
3580,--TERTULLIAN.,
3581,--TERTULLIAN.,"Leithen's story had bored and puzzled me at the start, but now it had"
3582,--TERTULLIAN.,somehow gripped my fancy.  Space a domain of endless corridors and
3583,--TERTULLIAN.,Presences moving in them!  The world was not quite the same as an hour
3584,--TERTULLIAN.,"ago.  It was the hour, as the French say, ""between dog and wolf,"" when"
3585,--TERTULLIAN.,the mind is disposed to marvels.  I thought of my stalking on the
3586,--TERTULLIAN.,"morrow, and was miserably conscious that I would miss my stag.  Those"
3587,--TERTULLIAN.,airy forms would get in the way.  Confound Leithen and his yarns!
3588,--TERTULLIAN.,
3589,--TERTULLIAN.,"""I want to hear the end of your story,""  I told him, as the lights of"
3590,--TERTULLIAN.,the Lodge showed half a mile distant.
3591,--TERTULLIAN.,
3592,--TERTULLIAN.,"""The end was a tragedy,"" he said slowly.  ""I don't much care to talk"
3593,--TERTULLIAN.,about it.  But how was I to know?  I couldn't see the nerve going.  You
3594,--TERTULLIAN.,see I couldn't believe it was all nonsense.  If I could I might have
3595,--TERTULLIAN.,"seen.  But I still think there was something in it--up to a point.  Oh,"
3596,--TERTULLIAN.,I agree he went mad in the end.  It is the only explanation.  Something
3597,--TERTULLIAN.,"must have snapped in that fine brain, and he saw the little bit more"
3598,--TERTULLIAN.,"which we call madness.  Thank God, you and I are prosaic fellows..."
3599,--TERTULLIAN.,
3600,--TERTULLIAN.,"""I was going out to Chamonix myself a week later.  But before I started"
3601,--TERTULLIAN.,"I got a post-card from Hollond, the only word from him.  He had printed"
3602,--TERTULLIAN.,"my name and address, and on the other side had scribbled six words--'I"
3603,--TERTULLIAN.,know at last--God's mercy.--H.G.H'  The handwriting was like a sick man
3604,--TERTULLIAN.,of ninety.  I knew that things must be pretty bad with my friend.
3605,--TERTULLIAN.,
3606,--TERTULLIAN.,"""I got to Chamonix in time for his funeral.  An ordinary climbing"
3607,--TERTULLIAN.,accident--you probably read about it in the papers. The Press talked
3608,--TERTULLIAN.,about the toll which the Alps took from intellectuals--the usual rot.
3609,--TERTULLIAN.,"There was an inquiry, but the facts were quite simple.  The body was"
3610,--TERTULLIAN.,only recognised by the clothes.  He had fallen several thousand feet.
3611,--TERTULLIAN.,
3612,--TERTULLIAN.,"""It seems that he had climbed for a few days with one of the Kronigs"
3613,--TERTULLIAN.,"and Dupont, and they had done some hair-raising things on the"
3614,--TERTULLIAN.,Aiguilles.  Dupont told me that they had found a new route up the
3615,--TERTULLIAN.,Montanvert side of the Charmoz.  He said that Hollond climbed like a
3616,--TERTULLIAN.,'diable fou' and if you know Dupont's standard of madness you will see
3617,--TERTULLIAN.,"that the pace must have been pretty hot. 'But monsieur was sick,' he"
3618,--TERTULLIAN.,"added; 'his eyes were not good.  And I and Franz, we were grieved for"
3619,--TERTULLIAN.,him and a little afraid.  We were glad when he left us.'
3620,--TERTULLIAN.,
3621,--TERTULLIAN.,"""He dismissed the guides two days before his death.  The next day he"
3622,--TERTULLIAN.,"spent in the hotel, getting his affairs straight.  He left everything"
3623,--TERTULLIAN.,"in perfect order, but not a line to a soul, not even to his sister."
3624,--TERTULLIAN.,The following day he set out alone about three in the morning for the
3625,--TERTULLIAN.,"Grepon.  He took the road up the Nantillons glacier to the Col, and"
3626,--TERTULLIAN.,then he must have climbed the Mummery crack by himself.  After that he
3627,--TERTULLIAN.,left the ordinary route and tried a new traverse across the Mer de
3628,--TERTULLIAN.,"Glace face.  Somewhere near the top he fell, and next day a party going"
3629,--TERTULLIAN.,to the Dent du Requin found him on the rocks thousands of feet below.
3630,--TERTULLIAN.,
3631,--TERTULLIAN.,"""He had slipped in attempting the most foolhardy course on earth, and"
3632,--TERTULLIAN.,there was a lot of talk about the dangers of guideless climbing.  But I
3633,--TERTULLIAN.,"guessed the truth, and I am sure Dupont knew, though he held his"
3634,--TERTULLIAN.,"tongue...."""
3635,--TERTULLIAN.,
3636,--TERTULLIAN.,"We were now on the gravel of the drive, and I was feeling better.  The"
3637,--TERTULLIAN.,thought of dinner warmed my heart and drove out the eeriness of the
3638,--TERTULLIAN.,"twilight glen.  The hour between dog and wolf was passing.  After all,"
3639,--TERTULLIAN.,there was a gross and jolly earth at hand for wise men who had a mind
3640,--TERTULLIAN.,to comfort.
3641,--TERTULLIAN.,
3642,--TERTULLIAN.,"Leithen, I saw, did not share my mood.  He looked glum and puzzled, as"
3643,--TERTULLIAN.,if his tale had aroused grim memories.  He finished it at the Lodge
3644,--TERTULLIAN.,door.
3645,--TERTULLIAN.,
3646,--TERTULLIAN.,"""... For, of course, he had gone out that day to die.  He had seen the"
3647,--TERTULLIAN.,"something more, the little bit too much, which plucks a man from his"
3648,--TERTULLIAN.,moorings.  He had gone so far into the land of pure spirit that he must
3649,--TERTULLIAN.,needs go further and shed the fleshly envelope that cumbered him.  God
3650,--TERTULLIAN.,send that he found rest!  I believe that he chose the steepest cliff in
3651,--TERTULLIAN.,the Alps for a purpose.  He wanted to be unrecognisable.  He was a
3652,--TERTULLIAN.,brave man and a good citizen.  I think he hoped that those who found

3725,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"""As streams of water in the south, Our bondage, Lord, recall."""
3726,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,--PSALM cxxvi.  (Scots Metrical Version).
3727,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,
3728,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,
3729,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"It was at the ford of the Clachlands Water in a tempestuous August,"
3730,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"that I, an idle boy, first learned the hardships of the Lammas droving."
3731,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"The shepherd of the Redswirehead, my very good friend, and his three"
3732,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"shaggy dogs, were working for their lives in an angry water.  The path"
3733,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,behind was thronged with scores of sheep bound for the Gledsmuir
3734,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"market, and beyond it was possible to discern through the mist the few"
3735,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,dripping dozen which had made the passage.  Between raged yards of
3736,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"brown foam coming down from murky hills, and the air echoed with the"
3737,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,yelp of dogs and the perplexed cursing of men.
3738,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,
3739,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"Before I knew I was helping in the task, with water lipping round my"
3740,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"waist and my arms filled with a terrified sheep.  It was no light task,"
3741,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,for though the water was no more than three feet deep it was swift and
3742,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"strong, and a kicking hogg is a sore burden.  But this was the only"
3743,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,road; the stream might rise higher at any moment; and somehow or other
3744,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,those bleating flocks had to be transferred to their fellows beyond.
3745,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"There were six men at the labour, six men and myself and all were"
3746,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,cross and wearied and heavy with water.
3747,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,
3748,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"I made my passages side by side with my friend the shepherd, and"
3749,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,thereby felt much elated.  This was a man who had dwelt all his days in
3750,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,the wilds and was familiar with torrents as with his own doorstep.  Now
3751,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"and then a swimming dog would bark feebly as he was washed against us,"
3752,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,and flatter his fool's heart that he was aiding the work.  And so we
3753,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"wrought on, till by midday I was dead-beat, and could scarce stagger"
3754,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"through the surf, while all the men had the same gasping faces.  I saw"
3755,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"the shepherd look with longing eye up the long green valley, and mutter"
3756,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,disconsolately in his beard.
3757,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,
3758,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"""Is the water rising?""  I asked."
3759,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,
3760,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"""It's no rising,"" said he, ""but I likena the look o' yon big black clud"
3761,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"upon Cairncraw.  I doubt there's been a shoor up the muirs, and a shoor"
3762,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,there means twae mair feet o' water in the Clachlands.  God help Sandy
3763,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"Jamieson's lambs, if there is."""
3764,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,
3765,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"""How many are left?""  I asked."
3766,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,
3767,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"""Three, fower,--no abune a score and a half,"" said he, running his eye"
3768,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"over the lessened flocks.  ""I maun try to tak twae at a time.""  So for"
3769,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"ten minutes he struggled with a double burden, and panted painfully at"
3770,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,each return.  Then with a sudden swift look up-stream he broke off and
3771,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"stood up.  ""Get ower the water, every yin o' ye, and leave the sheep,"""
3772,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"he said, and to my wonder every man of the five obeyed his word."
3773,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,
3774,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"And then I saw the reason of his command, for with a sudden swift leap"
3775,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"forward the Clachlands rose, and flooded up to where I stood an instant"
3776,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,before high and dry.
3777,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,
3778,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"""It's come,"" said the shepherd in a tone of fate, ""and there's fifteen"
3779,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"no ower yet, and Lord kens how they'll dae't.  They'll hae to gang"
3780,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"roond by Gledsmuir Brig, and that's twenty mile o' a differ.  'Deed,"
3781,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,it's no like that Sandy Jamieson will get a guid price the morn for sic
3782,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"sair forfochen beasts."""
3783,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,
3784,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,Then with firmly gripped staff he marched stoutly into the tide till it
3785,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"ran hissing below his armpits.  ""I could dae't alone,"" he cried, ""but"
3786,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"no wi' a burden.  For, losh, if ye slippit, ye'd be in the Manor Pool"
3787,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"afore ye could draw breath."""
3788,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,
3789,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"And so we waited with the great white droves and five angry men beyond,"
3790,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"and the path blocked by a surging flood.  For half an hour we waited,"
3791,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"holding anxious consultation across the stream, when to us thus busied"
3792,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"there entered a newcomer, a helper from the ends of the earth."
3793,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,
3794,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"He was a man of something over middle size, but with a stoop forward"
3795,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,that shortened him to something beneath it.  His dress was ragged
3796,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"homespun, the cast-off clothes of some sportsman, and in his arms he"
3797,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,bore a bundle of sticks and heather-roots which marked his calling.  I
3798,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"knew him for a tramp who long had wandered in the place, but I could"
3799,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,not account for the whole-voiced shout of greeting which met him as he
3800,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,stalked down the path.  He lifted his eyes and looked solemnly and long
3801,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"at the scene.  Then something of delight came into his eye, his face"
3802,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"relaxed, and flinging down his burden he stripped his coat and came"
3803,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,toward us.
3804,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,
3805,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"""Come on, Yeddie, ye're sair needed,"" said the shepherd, and I watched"
3806,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"with amazement this grizzled, crooked man seize a sheep by the fleece"
3807,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"and drag it to the water.  Then he was in the midst, stepping warily,"
3808,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"now up, now down the channel, but always nearing the farther bank.  At"
3809,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"last with a final struggle he landed his charge, and turned to journey"
3810,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"back.  Fifteen times did he cross that water, and at the end his mean"
3811,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"figure had wholly changed.  For now he was straighter and stronger, his"
3812,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"eye flashed, and his voice, as he cried out to the drovers, had in it a"
3813,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,tone of command.  I marvelled at the transformation; and when at length
3814,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"he had donned once more his ragged coat and shouldered his bundle, I"
3815,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,asked the shepherd his name.
3816,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,
3817,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"""They ca' him Adam Logan,"" said my friend, his face still bright with"
3818,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"excitement, ""but maist folk ca' him 'Streams o' Water.'"""
3819,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,
3820,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"""Ay,"" said I, ""and why 'Streams of Water'?"""
3821,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,
3822,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"""Juist for the reason ye see,"" said he."
3823,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,
3824,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"Now I knew the shepherd's way, and I held my peace, for it was clear"
3825,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"that his mind was revolving other matters, concerned most probably with"
3826,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"the high subject of the morrow's prices.  But in a little, as we"
3827,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"crossed the moor toward his dwelling, his thoughts relaxed and he"
3828,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,remembered my question.  So he answered me thus:
3829,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,
3830,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"""Oh, ay; as ye were sayin', he's a queer man Yeddie-aye been; guid kens"
3831,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"whaur he cam frae first, for he's been trampin' the countryside since"
3832,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"ever I mind, and that's no yesterday.  He maun be sixty year, and yet"
3833,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"he's as fresh as ever.  If onything, he's a thocht dafter in his"
3834,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"ongaein's, mair silent-like.  But ye'll hae heard tell o' him afore?"""
3835,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,I owned ignorance.
3836,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,
3837,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"""Tut,"" said he, ""ye ken nocht.  But Yeddie had aye a queer crakin' for"
3838,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,waters.  He never gangs on the road.  Wi' him it's juist up yae glen
3839,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,and doon anither and aye keepin' by the burn-side.  He kens every water
3840,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"i' the warld, every bit sheuch and burnie frae Gallowa' to Berwick."
3841,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"And then he kens the way o' spates the best I ever seen, and I've heard"
3842,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,tell o' him fordin' waters when nae ither thing could leeve i' them.
3843,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,He can weyse and wark his road sae cunnin'ly on the stanes that the
3844,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"roughest flood, if it's no juist fair ower his heid, canna upset him."
3845,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"Mony a sheep has he saved to me, and it's mony a guid drove wad never"
3846,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"hae won to Gledsmuir market but for Yeddie."""
3847,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,
3848,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"I listened with a boy's interest in any romantic narration.  Somehow,"
3849,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,the strange figure wrestling in the brown stream took fast hold on my
3850,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"mind, and I asked the shepherd for further tales."
3851,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,
3852,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"""There's little mair to tell,"" he said, ""for a gangrel life is nane o'"
3853,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,the liveliest.  But d'ye ken the langnebbit hill that cocks its tap
3854,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"abune the Clachlands heid? Weel, he's got a wee bit o' grund on the tap"
3855,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"frae the Yerl, and there he's howkit a grave for himsel'.  He's sworn"
3856,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"me and twae-three ithers to bury him there, wherever he may dee.  It's"
3857,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"a queer fancy in the auld dotterel."""
3858,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,
3859,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"So the shepherd talked, and as at evening we stood by his door we saw a"
3860,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"figure moving into the gathering shadows.  I knew it at once, and did"
3861,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"not need my friend's ""There gangs 'Streams o' Water'"" to recognise it."
3862,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,Something wild and pathetic in the old man's face haunted me like a
3863,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,"dream, and as the dusk swallowed him up, he seemed like some old Druid"
3864,STREAMS OF WATER IN THE SOUTH,recalled of the gods to his ancient habitation of the moors.

3868,II,II
3869,II,
3870,II,"Two years passed, and April came with her suns and rains and again the"
3871,II,"waters brimmed full in the valleys.  Under the clear, shining sky the"
3872,II,"lambing went on, and the faint bleat of sheep brooded on the hills.  In"
3873,II,"a land of young heather and green upland meads, of faint odours of"
3874,II,"moor-burn, and hill-tops falling in clear ridges to the sky-line, the"
3875,II,veriest St. Anthony would not abide indoors; so I flung all else to the
3876,II,winds and went a-fishing.
3877,II,
3878,II,"At the first pool on the Callowa, where the great flood sweeps nobly"
3879,II,"round a ragged shoulder of hill, and spreads into broad deeps beneath a"
3880,II,"tangle of birches, I began my toils.  The turf was still wet with dew"
3881,II,and the young leaves gleamed in the glow of morning.  Far up the stream
3882,II,"rose the grim hills which hem the mosses and tarns of that tableland,"
3883,II,whence flow the greater waters of the countryside.  An ineffable
3884,II,"freshness, as of the morning alike of the day and the seasons, filled"
3885,II,"the clear hill-air, and the remote peaks gave the needed touch of"
3886,II,intangible romance.
3887,II,
3888,II,"But as I fished I came on a man sitting in a green dell, busy at the"
3889,II,"making of brooms.  I knew his face and dress, for who could forget such"
3890,II,eclectic raggedness?--and I remembered that day two years before when
3891,II,"he first hobbled into my ken.  Now, as I saw him there, I was"
3892,II,captivated by the nameless mystery of his appearance.  There was
3893,II,something startling to one accustomed to the lack-lustre gaze of
3894,II,"town-bred folk, in the sight of an eye as keen and wild as a hawk's"
3895,II,from sheer solitude and lonely travelling.  He was so bent and scarred
3896,II,with weather that he seemed as much a part of that woodland place as
3897,II,"the birks themselves, and the noise of his labours did not startle the"
3898,II,birds that hopped on the branches.
3899,II,
3900,II,"Little by little I won his acquaintance--by a chance reminiscence, a"
3901,II,"single tale, the mention of a friend.  Then he made me free of his"
3902,II,"knowledge, and my fishing fared well that day.  He dragged me up little"
3903,II,"streams to sequestered pools, where I had astonishing success; and then"
3904,II,back to some great swirl in the Callowa where he had seen monstrous
3905,II,"takes.  And all the while he delighted me with his talk, of men and"
3906,II,"things, of weather and place, pitched high in his thin, old voice, and"
3907,II,"garnished with many tones of lingering sentiment.  He spoke in a broad,"
3908,II,"slow Scots, with so quaint a lilt in his speech that one seemed to be"
3909,II,in an elder time among people of a quieter life and a quainter
3910,II,kindliness.
3911,II,
3912,II,"Then by chance I asked him of a burn of which I had heard, and how it"
3913,II,might be reached.  I shall never forget the tone of his answer as his
3914,II,face grew eager and he poured forth his knowledge.
3915,II,
3916,II,"""Ye'll gang up the Knowe Burn, which comes down into the Cauldshaw."
3917,II,"It's a wee tricklin' thing, trowin' in and out o' pools i' the rock,"
3918,II,and comin' doun out o' the side o' Caerfraun.  Yince a merrymaiden
3919,II,"bided there, I've heard folks say, and used to win the sheep frae the"
3920,II,"Cauldshaw herd, and bile them i' the muckle pool below the fa'.  They"
3921,II,"say that there's a road to the ill Place there, and when the Deil likit"
3922,II,he sent up the lowe and garred the water faem and fizzle like an auld
3923,II,kettle.  But if ye're gaun to the Colm Burn ye maun haud atower the rig
3924,II,"o' the hill frae the Knowe heid, and ye'll come to it wimplin' among"
3925,II,"green brae faces.  It's a bonny bit, rale lonesome, but awfu' bonny,"
3926,II,"and there's mony braw trout in its siller flow."""
3927,II,
3928,II,"Then I remembered all I had heard of the old man's craze, and I"
3929,II,"humoured him.  ""It's a fine countryside for burns,""  I said."
3930,II,
3931,II,"""Ye may say that,"" said he gladly, ""a weel-watered land.  But a' this"
3932,II,braw south country is the same.  I've traivelled frae the Yeavering
3933,II,"Hill in the Cheviots to the Caldons in Galloway, and it's a' the same."
3934,II,"When I was young, I've seen me gang north to the Hielands and doun to"
3935,II,"the English lawlands, but now that I'm gettin' auld I maun bide i' the"
3936,II,"yae place.  There's no a burn in the South I dinna ken, and I never cam"
3937,II,"to the water I couldna ford."""
3938,II,
3939,II,"""No?"" said I.  ""I've seen you at the ford o' Clachlands in the Lammas"
3940,II,"floods."""
3941,II,
3942,II,"""Often I've been there,"" he went on, speaking like one calling up vague"
3943,II,"memories.  ""Yince, when Tam Rorison was drooned, honest man.  Yince"
3944,II,"again, when the brigs were ta'en awa', and the Black House o'"
3945,II,"Clachlands had nae bread for a week.  But oh, Clachlands is a bit easy"
3946,II,water.  But I've seen the muckle Aller come roarin' sae high that it
3947,II,washed awa' a sheepfold that stood weel up on the hill.  And I've seen
3948,II,"this verra burn, this bonny clear Callowa, lyin' like a loch for miles"
3949,II,"i' the haugh.  But I never heeds a spate, for if a man just kens the"
3950,II,"way o't it's a canny, hairmless thing.  I couldna wish to dee better"
3951,II,"than just be happit i' the waters o' my ain countryside, when my legs"
3952,II,"fail and I'm ower auld for the trampin'."""
3953,II,
3954,II,Something in that queer figure in the setting of the hills struck a
3955,II,note of curious pathos.  And towards evening as we returned down the
3956,II,glen the note grew keener.  A spring sunset of gold and crimson flamed
3957,II,in our backs and turned the clear pools to fire.  Far off down the vale
3958,II,the plains and the sea gleamed half in shadow.  Somehow in the
3959,II,"fragrance and colour and the delectable crooning of the stream, the"
3960,II,"fantastic and the dim seemed tangible and present, and high sentiment"
3961,II,revelled for once in my prosaic heart.
3962,II,
3963,II,And still more in the breast of my companion.  He stopped and sniffed
3964,II,"the evening air, as he looked far over hill and dale and then back to"
3965,II,"the great hills above us.  ""Yen's Crappel, and Caerdon, and the Laigh"
3966,II,"Law,"" he said, lingering with relish over each name, ""and the Gled"
3967,II,"comes doun atween them.  I haena been there for a twalmonth, and I maun"
3968,II,"hae anither glisk o't, for it's a braw place."" And then some bitter"
3969,II,"thought seemed to seize him, and his mouth twitched.  ""I'm an auld"
3970,II,"man,"" he cried, ""and I canna see ye a' again.  There's burns and mair"
3971,II,"burns in the high hills that I'll never win to.""  Then he remembered my"
3972,II,"presence, and stopped.  ""Ye maunna mind me,"" he said huskily, ""but the"
3973,II,"sicht o' a' thae lang blue hills makes me daft, now that I've faun i'"
3974,II,"the vale o' years.  Yince I was young and could get where I wantit, but"
3975,II,now I am auld and maun bide i' the same bit.  And I'm aye thinkin' o'
3976,II,"the waters I've been to, and the green heichs and howes and the linns"
3977,II,"that I canna win to again.  I maun e'en be content wi' the Callowa,"
3978,II,"which is as guid as the best."""
3979,II,
3980,II,"And then I left him, wandering down by the streamside and telling his"
3981,II,crazy meditations to himself.
3982,II,
3983,II,
3984,II,
3985,III,III
3986,III,
3987,III,"A space of years elapsed ere I met him, for fate had carried me far"
3988,III,from the upland valleys.  But once again I was afoot on the white
3989,III,"moor-roads; and, as I swung along one autumn afternoon up the path"
3990,III,"which leads from the Glen of Callowa to the Gled, I saw a figure before"
3991,III,"me which I knew for my friend.  When I overtook him, his appearance"
3992,III,"puzzled and troubled me.  Age seemed to have come on him at a bound,"
3993,III,and in the tottering figure and the stoop of weakness I had difficulty
3994,III,in recognising the hardy frame of the man as I had known him.
3995,III,"Something, too, had come over his face.  His brow was clouded, and the"
3996,III,tan of weather stood out hard and cruel on a blanched cheek.  His eye
3997,III,"seemed both wilder and sicklier, and for the first time I saw him with"
3998,III,none of the appurtenances of his trade.  He greeted me feebly and
3999,III,"dully, and showed little wish to speak.  He walked with slow, uncertain"
4000,III,"step, and his breath laboured with a new panting.  Every now and then"
4001,III,"he would look at me sidewise, and in his feverish glance I could detect"
4002,III,none of the free kindliness of old.  The man was ill in body and mind.
4003,III,
4004,III,I asked him how he had done since I saw him last.
4005,III,
4006,III,"""It's an ill world now,"" he said in a slow, querulous voice."
4007,III,
4008,III,"""There's nae need for honest men, and nae leevin'.  Folk dinna heed me"
4009,III,"ava now.  They dinna buy my besoms, they winna let me bide a nicht in"
4010,III,"their byres, and  they're no like the kind canty folk in the auld"
4011,III,times.  And a' the countryside is changin'.  Doun by Goldieslaw they're
4012,III,"makkin' a dam for takin' water to the toun, and they're thinkin' o'"
4013,III,"daein' the like wi' the Callowa.  Guid help us, can they no let the"
4014,III,works o' God alane?  Is there no room for them in the dirty lawlands
4015,III,"that they maun file the hills wi' their biggins?"""
4016,III,
4017,III,I conceived dimly that the cause of his wrath was a scheme for
4018,III,"waterworks at the border of the uplands, but I had less concern for"
4019,III,this than his strangely feeble health.
4020,III,
4021,III,"""You are looking ill,""  I said.  ""What has come over you?"""
4022,III,
4023,III,"""Oh, I canna last for aye,"" he said mournfully.  ""My auld body's about"
4024,III,"dune.  I've warkit it ower sair when I had it, and it's gaun to fail on"
4025,III,my hands.  Sleepin' out o' wat nichts and gangin' lang wantin' meat are
4026,III,"no the best ways for a long life""; and he smiled the ghost of a smile."
4027,III,
4028,III,And then he fell to wild telling of the ruin of the place and the
4029,III,"hardness of the people, and I saw that want and bare living had gone"
4030,III,"far to loosen his wits.  I knew the countryside, and I recognised that"
4031,III,change was only in his mind.  And a great pity seized me for this
4032,III,lonely figure toiling on in the bitterness of regret.  I tried to
4033,III,"comfort him, but my words were useless, for he took no heed of me; with"
4034,III,bent head and faltering step he mumbled his sorrows to himself.
4035,III,
4036,III,Then of a sudden we came to the crest of the ridge where the road dips
4037,III,from the hill-top to the sheltered valley.  Sheer from the heather ran
4038,III,the white streak till it lost itself among the reddening rowans and the
4039,III,"yellow birks of the wood.  The land was rich in autumn colour, and the"
4040,III,shining waters dipped and fell through a pageant of russet and gold.
4041,III,"And all around hills huddled in silent spaces, long brown moors crowned"
4042,III,"with cairns, or steep fortresses of rock and shingle rising to"
4043,III,foreheads of steel-like grey.  The autumn blue faded in the far
4044,III,"sky-line to white, and lent distance to the farther peaks.  The hush of"
4045,III,"the wilderness, which is far different from the hush of death, brooded"
4046,III,"over the scene, and like faint music came the sound of a distant"
4047,III,"scytheswing, and the tinkling whisper which is the flow of a hundred"
4048,III,streams.
4049,III,
4050,III,"I am an old connoisseur in the beauties of the uplands, but I held my"
4051,III,"breath at the sight.  And when I glanced at my companion, he, too, had"
4052,III,"raised his head, and stood with wide nostrils and gleaming eye"
4053,III,"revelling in this glimpse of Arcady.  Then he found his voice, and the"
4054,III,weakness and craziness seemed for one moment to leave him.
4055,III,
4056,III,"""It's my ain land,"" he cried, ""and I'll never leave it.  D'ye see yon"
4057,III,"broun hill wi' the lang cairn?"" and he gripped my arm fiercely and"
4058,III,"directed my gaze.  ""Yon's my bit.  I howkit it richt on the verra tap,"
4059,III,and ilka year I gang there to make it neat and ordlerly.  I've trystit
4060,III,wi' fower men in different pairishes that whenever they hear o' my
4061,III,"death, they'll cairry me up yonder and bury me there.  And then I'll"
4062,III,"never leave it, but be still and quiet to the warld's end.  I'll aye"
4063,III,"hae the sound o' water in my ear, for there's five burns tak' their"
4064,III,"rise on that hillside, and on a' airts the glens gang doun to the Gled"
4065,III,"and the Aller."""
4066,III,
4067,III,"Then his spirit failed him, his voice sank, and he was almost the"
4068,III,"feeble gangrel once more.  But not yet, for again his eye swept the"
4069,III,"ring of hills, and he muttered to himself names which I knew for"
4070,III,"streams, lingeringly, lovingly, as of old affections.  ""Aller and Gled"
4071,III,"and Callowa,"" he crooned, ""braw names, and Clachlands and Cauldshaw and"
4072,III,the Lanely Water.  And I maunna forget the Stark and the Lin and the
4073,III,bonny streams o' the Creran.  And what mair?  I canna mind a' the
4074,III,"burns, the Howe and the Hollies and the Fawn and the links o' the"
4075,III,Manor.  What says the Psalmist about them?
4076,III,
4077,III,"'As streams o' water in the South, Our bondage Lord, recall.'"
4078,III,
4079,III,"Ay, but yen's the name for them.  'Streams o' water in the South.'"""
4080,III,
4081,III,And as we went down the slopes to the darkening vale I heard him
4082,III,"crooning to himself in a high, quavering voice the single distich; then"
4083,III,"in a little his weariness took him again, and he plodded on with no"
4084,III,thought save for his sorrows.
4085,III,
4086,III,
4087,III,
4088,IV,IV
4089,IV,
4090,IV,"The conclusion of this tale belongs not to me, but to the shepherd of"
4091,IV,"the Redswirehead, and I heard it from him in his dwelling, as I stayed"
4092,IV,"the night, belated on the darkening moors.  He told me it after supper"
4093,IV,"in a flood of misty Doric, and his voice grew rough at times, and he"
4094,IV,poked viciously at the dying peat.
4095,IV,
4096,IV,"In the last back-end I was at Gledfoot wi' sheep, and a weary job I had"
4097,IV,"and little credit.  Ye ken the place, a lang dreich shore wi' the wind"
4098,IV,"swirlin' and bitin' to the bane, and the broun Gled water choked wi'"
4099,IV,"Solloway sand.  There was nae room in ony inn in the town, so I bude to"
4100,IV,"gang to a bit public on the Harbour Walk, where sailor-folk and"
4101,IV,"fishermen feucht and drank, and nae dacent men frae the hills thocht of"
4102,IV,"gangin'.  I was in a gey ill way, for I had sell't my beasts dooms"
4103,IV,"cheap, and I thocht o' the lang miles hame in the wintry weather.  So"
4104,IV,"after a bite o' meat I gangs out to get the air and clear my heid,"
4105,IV,which was a' rammled wi' the auction-ring.
4106,IV,
4107,IV,"And whae did I find, sittin' on a bench at the door, but the auld man"
4108,IV,Yeddie.  He was waur changed than ever.  His lang hair was hingin' over
4109,IV,"his broo, and his face was thin and white as a ghaist's.  His claes"
4110,IV,"fell loose about him, and he sat wi' his hand on his auld stick and his"
4111,IV,"chin on his hand, hearin' nocht and glowerin' afore him.  He never saw"
4112,IV,"nor kenned me till I shook him by the shoulders, and cried him by his"
4113,IV,name.
4114,IV,
4115,IV,"""Whae are ye?"" says he, in a thin voice that gaed to my hert."
4116,IV,
4117,IV,"""Ye ken me fine, ye auld fule,"" says I.  ""I'm Jock Rorison o' the"
4118,IV,"Redswirehead, whaur ye've stoppit often."""
4119,IV,

4131,IV,
4132,IV,"I saw fine that the man was daft, but what answer could I gie to his"
4133,IV,"havers?  Folk in the Callowa Glens are as kind as afore, but ill"
4134,IV,"weather and auld age had put queer notions intil his heid.  Forbye, he"
4135,IV,"was seeck, seeck unto death, and I saw mair in his een than I likit to"

4137,IV,
4138,IV,"""Come in-by and get some meat, man,""  I said.  ""Ye're famishin' wi'"

4142,IV,"I had a bite, for I'm no hungry.  But I'm awfu' thirsty.  I cam here"
4143,IV,"yestreen, and I can get nae water to drink like the water in the hills."
4144,IV,"I maun be settin' out back the morn, if the Lord spares me."""
4145,IV,
4146,IV,"I mindit fine that the body wad tak nae drink like an honest man, but"

4148,IV,"brain.  I never spak a word, for the maitter was bye ony mortal's aid."
4149,IV,
4150,IV,For lang he sat quiet.  Then he lifts his heid and looks awa ower the
4151,IV,grey sea.  A licht for a moment cam intil his een.
4152,IV,
4153,IV,"""Whatna big water's yon?"" he said, wi' his puir mind aye rinnin' on"
4154,IV,waters.
4155,IV,
4156,IV,"""That's the Solloway,"" says I."
4157,IV,

4166,IV,

4168,IV,
4169,IV,"He keepit repeatin' the word ower in his mouth.  ""The salt, the salt,"
4170,IV,"I've heard tell o' it afore, but I dinna like it.  It's terrible cauld"
4171,IV,"and unhamely."""
4172,IV,
4173,IV,"By this time an onding o' rain was coming up' frae the water, and I"
4174,IV,"bade the man come indoors to the fire.  He followed me, as biddable as"
4175,IV,"a sheep, draggin' his legs like yin far gone in seeckness.  I set him"
4176,IV,"by the fire, and put whisky at his elbow, but he wadna touch it."
4177,IV,
4178,IV,"""I've nae need o' it,"" said he.  ""I'm find and warm""; and he sits"
4179,IV,"staring at the fire, aye comin' ower again and again, ""The Solloway,"
4180,IV,"the Solloway.  It's a guid name and a muckle water."""
4181,IV,
4182,IV,"But sune I gaed to my bed, being heavy wi' sleep, for I had traivelled"
4183,IV,for twae days.
4184,IV,
4185,IV,The next morn I was up at six and out to see the weather.  It was a'
4186,IV,changed.  The muckle tides lay lang and still as our ain Loch o' the
4187,IV,"Lee, and far ayont I saw the big blue hills o' England shine bricht and"
4188,IV,"clear.  I thankit Providence for the day, for it was better to tak the"
4189,IV,lang miles back in sic a sun than in a blast o' rain.
4190,IV,
4191,IV,But as I lookit I saw some folk comin' up frae the beach carryin'
4192,IV,"something atween them.  My hert gied a loup, and ""some puir, drooned"
4193,IV,"sailor-body,"" says I to mysel', ""whae has perished in yesterday's"
4194,IV,"storm.""  But as they cam nearer I got a glisk which made me run like"
4195,IV,"daft, and lang ere I was up on them I saw it was Yeddie."
4196,IV,
4197,IV,"He lay drippin' and white, wi' his puir auld hair lyin' back frae his"
4198,IV,broo and the duds clingin' to his legs.  But out o' the face there had
4199,IV,"gane a' the seeckness and weariness.  His een were stelled, as if he"
4200,IV,"had been lookin' forrit to something, and his lips were set like a man"
4201,IV,"on a lang errand.  And mair, his stick was grippit sae firm in his hand"
4202,IV,"that nae man could loose it, so they e'en let it be."
4203,IV,
4204,IV,"Then they tell't me the tale o't, how at the earliest licht they had"
4205,IV,"seen him wanderin' alang the sands, juist as they were putting out"
4206,IV,"their boats to sea.  They wondered and watched him, till of a sudden he"
4207,IV,"turned to the water and wadit in, keeping straucht on till he was oot"
4208,IV,"o' sicht.  They rowed a' their pith to the place, but they were ower"
4209,IV,"late.  Yince they saw his heid appear abune water, still wi' his face"
4210,IV,"to the other side; and then they got his body, for the tide was rinnin'"
4211,IV,"low in the mornin'.  I tell't them a' I kenned o' him, and they were"
4212,IV,"sair affected.  ""Puir cratur,"" said yin, ""he's shurely better now."""
4213,IV,
4214,IV,So we brocht him up to the house and laid him there till the folk i'
4215,IV,the town had heard o' the business.  Syne the procurator-fiscal came
4216,IV,and certifeed the death and the rest was left tae me.  I got a wooden
4217,IV,"coffin made and put him in it, juist as he was, wi' his staff in his"
4218,IV,"hand and his auld duds about him.  I mindit o' my sworn word, for I was"
4219,IV,"yin o' the four that had promised, and I ettled to dae his bidding.  It"
4220,IV,"was saxteen mile to the hills, and yin and twenty to the lanely tap"
4221,IV,whaur he had howkit his grave.  But I never heedit it.  I'm a strong
4222,IV,"man, weel-used to the walkin' and my hert was sair for the auld body."
4223,IV,"Now that he had gotten deliverance from his affliction, it was for me"
4224,IV,"to leave him in the place he wantit.  Forbye, he wasna muckle heavier"
4225,IV,than a bairn.
4226,IV,
4227,IV,"It was a long road, a sair road, but I did it, and by seven o'clock I"
4228,IV,"was at the edge o' the muirlands.  There was a braw mune, and a the"
4229,IV,"glens and taps stood out as clear as midday.  Bit by bit, for I was gey"
4230,IV,"tired, I warstled ower the rigs and up the cleuchs to the Gled-head;"
4231,IV,syne up the stany Gled-cleuch to the lang grey hill which they ca' the
4232,IV,"Hurlybackit.  By ten I had come to the cairn, and black i' the mune I"
4233,IV,"saw the grave.  So there I buried him, and though I'm no a releegious"
4234,IV,"man, I couldna help sayin' ower him the guid words o' the Psalmist--"
4235,IV,
4236,IV,"""As streams of water in the South,"
4237,IV,"Our bondage, Lord, recall."""
4238,IV,
4239,IV,"So if you go from the Gled to the Aller, and keep far over the north"
4240,IV,"side of the Muckle Muneraw, you will come in time to a stony ridge"
4241,IV,which ends in a cairn.  There you will see the whole hill country of
4242,IV,"the south, a hundred lochs, a myriad streams, and a forest of"
4243,IV,"hill-tops.  There on the very crest lies the old man, in the heart of"
4244,IV,"his own land, at the fountain-head of his many waters.  If you listen"
4245,IV,you will hear a hushed noise as of the swaying in trees or a ripple on
4246,IV,"the sea.  It is the sound of the rising of burns, which, innumerable"
4247,IV,"and unnumbered, flow thence to the silent glens for evermore."

4330,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"years I have been falling in love with this country, and now I am up to"
4331,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"the neck."""
4332,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4333,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"He flung himself back in the camp-chair till the canvas creaked, and"
4334,--PAUL VERLAINE.,looked at me below his eyelids.  I remember glancing at the lines of
4335,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"him, and thinking what a fine make of a man he was.  In his untanned"
4336,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"field-boots, breeches, and grey shirt, he looked the born wilderness"
4337,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"hunter, though less than two months before he had been driving down to"
4338,--PAUL VERLAINE.,the City every morning in the sombre regimentals of his class.  Being a
4339,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"fair man, he was gloriously tanned, and there was a clear line at his"
4340,--PAUL VERLAINE.,shirt-collar to mark the limits of his sunburn.  I had first known him
4341,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"years ago, when he was a broker's clerk working on half-commission."
4342,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"Then he had gone to South Africa, and soon I heard he was a partner in"
4343,--PAUL VERLAINE.,a mining house which was doing wonders with some gold areas in the
4344,--PAUL VERLAINE.,North.  The next step was his return to London as the new
4345,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"millionaire,--young, good-looking, wholesome in mind and body, and much"
4346,--PAUL VERLAINE.,sought after by the mothers of marriageable girls.  We played polo
4347,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"together, and hunted a little in the season, but there were signs that"
4348,--PAUL VERLAINE.,he did not propose to become the conventional English gentleman.  He
4349,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"refused to buy a place in the country, though half the Homes of England"
4350,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"were at his disposal.  He was a very busy man, he declared, and had not"
4351,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"time to be a squire.  Besides, every few months he used to rush out to"
4352,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"South Africa.  I saw that he was restless, for he was always badgering"
4353,--PAUL VERLAINE.,me to go big-game hunting with him in some remote part of the earth.
4354,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"There was that in his eyes, too, which marked him out from the ordinary"
4355,--PAUL VERLAINE.,blond type of our countrymen.  They were large and brown and
4356,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"mysterious, and the light of another race was in their odd depths."
4357,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4358,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"To hint such a thing would have meant a breach of friendship, for"
4359,--PAUL VERLAINE.,Lawson was very proud of his birth.  When he first made his fortune he
4360,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"had gone to the Heralds to discover his family, and these obliging"
4361,--PAUL VERLAINE.,gentlemen had provided a pedigree.  It appeared that he was a scion of
4362,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"the house of Lowson or Lowieson, an ancient and rather disreputable"
4363,--PAUL VERLAINE.,clan on the Scottish side of the Border.  He took a shooting in
4364,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"Teviotdale on the strength of it, and used to commit lengthy Border"
4365,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"ballads to memory.  But I had known his father, a financial journalist"
4366,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"who never quite succeeded, and I had heard of a grandfather who sold"
4367,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"antiques in a back street at Brighton.  The latter, I think, had not"
4368,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"changed his name, and still frequented the synagogue.  The father was a"
4369,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"progressive Christian, and the mother had been a blonde Saxon from the"
4370,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"Midlands.  In my mind there was no doubt, as I caught Lawson's"
4371,--PAUL VERLAINE.,heavy-lidded eyes fixed on me.  My friend was of a more ancient race
4372,--PAUL VERLAINE.,than the Lowsons of the Border.
4373,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4374,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"""Where are you thinking of looking for your house?"" I asked. ""In Natal"
4375,--PAUL VERLAINE.,or in the Cape Peninsula?  You might get the Fishers' place if you paid
4376,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"a price."""
4377,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4378,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"""The Fishers' place be hanged!"" he said crossly.  ""I don't want any"
4379,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"stuccoed, over-grown Dutch farm.  I might as well be at Roehampton as"
4380,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"in the Cape."""
4381,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4382,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"He got up and walked to the far side of the fire, where a lane ran down"
4383,--PAUL VERLAINE.,through the thornscrub to a gully of the hills.  The moon was silvering
4384,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"the bush of the plains, forty miles off and three thousand feet below"
4385,--PAUL VERLAINE.,us.
4386,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4387,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"""I am going to live somewhere hereabouts,""  he answered at last.  I"
4388,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"whistled.  ""Then you've got to put your hand in your pocket, old man."
4389,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"You'll have to make everything, including a map of the countryside."""
4390,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4391,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"""I know,"" he said; ""that's where the fun comes in.  Hang it all, why"
4392,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"shouldn't I indulge my fancy?  I'm uncommonly well off, and I haven't"
4393,--PAUL VERLAINE.,chick or child to leave it to.  Supposing I'm a hundred miles from
4394,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"rail-head, what about it?  I'll make a motor-road and fix up a"
4395,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"telephone.  I'll grow most of my supplies, and start a colony to"
4396,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"provide labour.  When you come and stay with me, you'll get the best"
4397,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"food and drink on earth, and sport that will make your mouth water."
4398,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"I'll put Lochleven trout in these streams,--at 6,000 feet you can do"
4399,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"anything.  We'll have a pack of hounds, too, and we can drive pig in"
4400,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"the woods, and if we want big game there are the Mangwe flats at our"
4401,--PAUL VERLAINE.,feet.  I tell you I'll make such a country-house as nobody ever dreamed
4402,--PAUL VERLAINE.,of.  A man will come plumb out of stark savagery into lawns and
4403,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"rose-gardens.""  Lawson flung himself into his chair again and smiled"
4404,--PAUL VERLAINE.,dreamily at the fire.
4405,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4406,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"""But why here, of all places?"" I persisted.  I was not feeling very"
4407,--PAUL VERLAINE.,well and did not care for the country.
4408,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4409,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"""I can't quite explain.  I think it's the sort of land I have always"
4410,--PAUL VERLAINE.,been looking for.  I always fancied a house on a green plateau in a
4411,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"decent climate looking down on the tropics.  I like heat and colour,"
4412,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"you know, but I like hills too, and greenery, and the things that bring"
4413,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"back Scotland.  Give me a cross between Teviotdale and the Orinoco,"
4414,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"and, by Gad! I think I've got it here."""
4415,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4416,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"I watched my friend curiously, as with bright eyes and eager voice he"
4417,--PAUL VERLAINE.,talked of his new fad.  The two races were very clear in him--the one
4418,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"desiring gorgeousness, the other athirst for the soothing spaces of the"
4419,--PAUL VERLAINE.,North.  He began to plan out the house.  He would get Adamson to design
4420,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"it, and it was to grow out of the landscape like a stone on the"
4421,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"hillside.  There would be wide verandahs and cool halls, but great"
4422,--PAUL VERLAINE.,fireplaces against winter time.  It would all be very simple and
4423,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"fresh--""clean as morning"" was his odd phrase;  but then another idea"
4424,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"supervened, and he talked of bringing the Tintorets from Hill Street."
4425,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"""I want it to be a civilised house, you know.  No silly luxury, but the"
4426,--PAUL VERLAINE.,best pictures and china and books.  I'll have all the furniture made
4427,--PAUL VERLAINE.,after the old plain English models out of native woods.  I don't want
4428,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"second-hand sticks in a new country.  Yes, by Jove, the Tintorets are a"
4429,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"great idea, and all those Ming pots I bought.  I had meant to sell"
4430,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"them, but I'll have them out here."""
4431,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4432,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"He talked for a good hour of what he would do, and his dream grew"
4433,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"richer as he talked, till by the time we went to bed he had sketched"
4434,--PAUL VERLAINE.,something more like a palace than a country-house.  Lawson was by no
4435,--PAUL VERLAINE.,means a luxurious man.  At present he was well content with a Wolseley
4436,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"valise, and shaved cheerfully out of a tin mug.  It struck me as odd"
4437,--PAUL VERLAINE.,that a man so simple in his habits should have so sumptuous a taste in
4438,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"bric-a-brac.  I told myself, as I turned in, that the Saxon mother from"
4439,--PAUL VERLAINE.,the Midlands had done little to dilute the strong wine of the East.
4440,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4441,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"It drizzled next morning when we inspanned, and I mounted my horse in a"
4442,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"bad temper.  I had some fever on me, I think, and I hated this lush yet"
4443,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"frigid tableland, where all the winds on earth lay in wait for one's"
4444,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"marrow.  Lawson was, as usual, in great spirits.  We were not hunting,"
4445,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"but shifting our hunting-ground, so all morning we travelled fast to"
4446,--PAUL VERLAINE.,the north along the rim of the uplands.
4447,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4448,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"At midday it cleared, and the afternoon was a pageant of pure colour."
4449,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"The wind sank to a low breeze; the sun lit the infinite green spaces,"
4450,--PAUL VERLAINE.,and kindled the wet forest to a jewelled coronal.  Lawson gaspingly
4451,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"admired it all, as he cantered bareheaded up a bracken-clad slope."
4452,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"""God's country,"" he said twenty times.  ""I've found it.""  Take a piece"
4453,--PAUL VERLAINE.,of Sussex downland; put a stream in every hollow and a patch of wood;
4454,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"and at the edge, where the cliffs at home would fall to the sea, put a"
4455,--PAUL VERLAINE.,cloak of forest muffling the scarp and dropping thousands of feet to
4456,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"the blue plains.  Take the diamond air of the Gornergrat, and the riot"
4457,--PAUL VERLAINE.,of colour which you get by a West Highland lochside in late September.
4458,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"Put flowers everywhere, the things we grow in hothouses, geraniums like"
4459,--PAUL VERLAINE.,sun-shades and arums like trumpets.  That will give you a notion of the
4460,--PAUL VERLAINE.,countryside we were in.  I began to see that after all it was out of
4461,--PAUL VERLAINE.,the common.
4462,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4463,--PAUL VERLAINE.,And just before sunset we came over a ridge and found something better.
4464,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"It was a shallow glen, half a mile wide, down which ran a blue-grey"
4465,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"stream in lings like the Spean, till at the edge of the plateau it"
4466,--PAUL VERLAINE.,leaped into the dim forest in a snowy cascade.  The opposite side ran
4467,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"up in gentle slopes to a rocky knell, from which the eye had a noble"
4468,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"prospect of the plains.  All down the glen were little copses, half"
4469,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"moons of green edging some silvery shore of the burn, or delicate"
4470,--PAUL VERLAINE.,clusters of tall trees nodding on the hill brow.  The place so
4471,--PAUL VERLAINE.,satisfied the eye that for the sheer wonder of its perfection we
4472,--PAUL VERLAINE.,stopped and stared in silence for many minutes.
4473,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4474,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"Then ""The House,""  I said, and Lawson replied softly, ""The House!"""
4475,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4476,--PAUL VERLAINE.,We rode slowly into the glen in the mulberry gloaming.  Our transport
4477,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"waggons were half an hour behind, so we had time to explore.  Lawson"
4478,--PAUL VERLAINE.,dismounted and plucked handfuls of flowers from the water meadows.  He
4479,--PAUL VERLAINE.,was singing to himself all the time--an old French catch about Cadet
4480,--PAUL VERLAINE.,Rousselle and his Trois maisons.
4481,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4482,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"""Who owns it?""  I asked."
4483,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4484,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"""My firm, as like as not.  We have miles of land about here.  But"
4485,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"whoever the man is, he has got to sell.  Here I build my tabernacle,"
4486,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"old man.  Here, and nowhere else!"""
4487,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4488,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"In the very centre of the glen, in a loop of the stream, was one copse"
4489,--PAUL VERLAINE.,which even in that half light struck me as different from the others.
4490,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"It was of tall, slim, fairy-like trees, the kind of wood the monks"
4491,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"painted in old missals.  No, I rejected the thought.  It was no"
4492,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"Christian wood.  It was not a copse, but a ""grove,""--one such as"
4493,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"Artemis may have flitted through in the moonlight.  It was small, forty"
4494,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"or fifty yards in diameter, and there was a dark something at the heart"
4495,--PAUL VERLAINE.,of it which for a second I thought was a house.
4496,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4497,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"We turned between the slender trees, and--was it fancy?--an odd tremor"
4498,--PAUL VERLAINE.,went through me.  I felt as if I were penetrating the temenos of some
4499,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"strange and lovely divinity, the goddess of this pleasant vale.  There"
4500,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"was a spell in the air, it seemed, and an odd dead silence."
4501,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4502,--PAUL VERLAINE.,Suddenly my horse started at a flutter of light wings.  A flock of
4503,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"doves rose from the branches, and I saw the burnished green of their"
4504,--PAUL VERLAINE.,plumes against the opal sky.  Lawson did not seem to notice them.  I
4505,--PAUL VERLAINE.,saw his keen eyes staring at the centre of the grove and what stood
4506,--PAUL VERLAINE.,there.
4507,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4508,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"It was a little conical tower, ancient and lichened, but, so far as I"
4509,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"could judge, quite flawless.  You know the famous Conical Temple at"
4510,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"Zimbabwe, of which prints are in every guidebook.  This was of the same"
4511,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"type, but a thousandfold more perfect.  It stood about thirty feet"
4512,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"high, of solid masonry, without door or window or cranny, as shapely as"
4513,--PAUL VERLAINE.,when it first came from the hands of the old builders.  Again I had the
4514,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"sense of breaking in on a sanctuary.  What right had I, a common vulgar"
4515,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"modern, to be looking at this fair thing, among these delicate trees,"
4516,--PAUL VERLAINE.,which some white goddess had once taken for her shrine?
4517,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4518,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"Lawson broke in on my absorption.  ""Let's get out of this,"" he said"
4519,--PAUL VERLAINE.,hoarsely and he took my horse's bridle (he had left his own beast at
4520,--PAUL VERLAINE.,the edge) and led him back to the open.  But I noticed that his eyes
4521,--PAUL VERLAINE.,were always turning back and that his hand trembled.
4522,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4523,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"""That settles it,""  I said after supper.  ""What do you want with your"
4524,--PAUL VERLAINE.,mediaeval Venetians and your Chinese pots now?  You will have the
4525,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"finest antique in the world in your garden--a temple as old as time,"
4526,--PAUL VERLAINE.,and in a land which they say has no history.  You had the right
4527,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"inspiration this time."""
4528,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4529,--PAUL VERLAINE.,I think I have said that Lawson had hungry eyes.  In his enthusiasm
4530,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"they used to glow and brighten; but now, as he sat looking down at the"
4531,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"olive shades of the glen, they seemed ravenous in their fire.  He had"
4532,--PAUL VERLAINE.,hardly spoken a word since we left the wood.
4533,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4534,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"""Where can I read about these things?"" he asked, and I gave him the"
4535,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"names of books.  Then, an hour later, he asked me who were the"
4536,--PAUL VERLAINE.,builders.  I told him the little I knew about Phoenician and Sabaen
4537,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"wanderings, and the ritual of Sidon and Tyre.  He repeated some names"
4538,--PAUL VERLAINE.,to himself and went soon to bed.
4539,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4540,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"As I turned in, I had one last look over the glen, which lay ivory and"
4541,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"black in the moon.  I seemed to hear a faint echo of wings, and to see"
4542,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"over the little grove a cloud of light visitants.  ""The Doves of"
4543,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"Ashtaroth have come back,""  I said to myself.  ""It is a good omen."
4544,--PAUL VERLAINE.,"They accept the new tenant.""  But as I fell asleep I had a sudden"
4545,--PAUL VERLAINE.,thought that I was saying something rather terrible.
4546,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4547,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4548,--PAUL VERLAINE.,
4549,II,II
4550,II,
4551,II,"Three years later, pretty nearly to a day, I came back to see what"
4552,II,"Lawson had made of his hobby.  He had bidden me often to Welgevonden,"
4553,II,as he chose to call it--though I do not know why he should have fixed a
4554,II,Dutch name to a countryside where Boer never trod.  At the last there
4555,II,"had been some confusion about dates, and I wired the time of my"
4556,II,"arrival, and set off without an answer.  A motor met me at the queer"
4557,II,"little wayside station of Taqui, and after many miles on a doubtful"
4558,II,"highway I came to the gates of the park, and a road on which it was a"
4559,II,delight to move.  Three years had wrought little difference in the
4560,II,"landscape.  Lawson had done some planting,--conifers and flowering"
4561,II,"shrubs and suchlike,--but wisely he had resolved that Nature had for"
4562,II,"the most part forestalled him.  All the same, he must have spent a mint"
4563,II,"of money.  The drive could not have been beaten in England, and fringes"
4564,II,of mown turf on either hand had been pared out of the lush meadows.
4565,II,When we came over the edge of the hill and looked down on the secret
4566,II,"glen, I could not repress a cry of pleasure.  The house stood on the"
4567,II,"farther ridge, the viewpoint of the whole neighbourhood; and its brown"
4568,II,timbers and white rough-cast walls melted into the hillside as if it
4569,II,had been there from the beginning of things.  The vale below was
4570,II,ordered in lawns and gardens.  A blue lake received the rapids of the
4571,II,"stream, and its banks were a maze of green shades and glorious masses"
4572,II,"of blossom.  I noticed, too, that the little grove we had explored on"
4573,II,"our first visit stood alone in a big stretch of lawn, so that its"
4574,II,"perfection might be clearly seen.  Lawson had excellent taste, or he"
4575,II,had had the best advice.
4576,II,
4577,II,"The butler told me that his master was expected home shortly, and took"
4578,II,me into the library for tea.  Lawson had left his Tintorets and Ming
4579,II,"pots at home after all.  It was a long, low room, panelled in teak"
4580,II,"half-way up the walls, and the shelves held a multitude of fine"
4581,II,"bindings.  There were good rugs on the parquet door, but no ornaments"
4582,II,"anywhere, save three.  On the carved mantelpiece stood two of the old"
4583,II,"soapstone birds which they used to find at Zimbabwe, and between, on an"
4584,II,"ebony stand, a half moon of alabaster, curiously carved with zodiacal"
4585,II,"figures.  My host had altered his scheme of furnishing, but I approved"
4586,II,the change.
4587,II,
4588,II,"He came in about half-past six, after I had consumed two cigars and all"
4589,II,"but fallen asleep.  Three years make a difference in most men, but I"
4590,II,"was not prepared for the change in Lawson.  For one thing, he had grown"
4591,II,"fat.  In place of the lean young man I had known, I saw a heavy,"
4592,II,"flaccid being, who shuffled in his gait, and seemed tired and listless."
4593,II,"His sunburn had gone, and his face was as pasty as a city clerk's.  He"
4594,II,"had been walking, and wore shapeless flannel clothes, which hung loose"
4595,II,"even on his enlarged figure.  And the worst of it was, that he did not"
4596,II,"seem over-pleased to see me.  He murmured something about my journey,"
4597,II,and then flung himself into an arm-chair and looked out of the window.
4598,II,
4599,II,I asked him if he had been ill.
4600,II,
4601,II,"""Ill! No!"" he said crossly.  ""Nothing of the kind.  I'm perfectly well."""
4602,II,
4603,II,"""You don't look as fit as this place should make you.  What do you do"
4604,II,"with yourself? Is the shooting as good as you hoped?"""
4605,II,
4606,II,"He did not answer, but I thought I heard him mutter something like"
4607,II,"""shooting be damned."""
4608,II,
4609,II,"Then I tried the subject of the house.  I praised it extravagantly, but"
4610,II,"with conviction.  ""There can be no place like it in the world,"" I said."
4611,II,
4612,II,"He turned his eyes on me at last, and I saw that they were as deep and"
4613,II,restless as ever.  With his pallid face they made him look curiously
4614,II,Semitic.  I had been right in my theory about his ancestry.
4615,II,
4616,II,"""Yes,"" he said slowly, ""there is no place like it--in the world."""
4617,II,
4618,II,"Then he pulled himself to his feet.  ""I'm going to change,""  he said."
4619,II,"""Dinner is at eight.  Ring for Travers, and he'll show you your room."""
4620,II,
4621,II,"I dressed in a noble bedroom, with an outlook over the garden-vale and"
4622,II,"the escarpment to the far line of the plains, now blue and saffron in"
4623,II,"the sunset.  I dressed in an ill temper, for I was seriously offended"
4624,II,"with Lawson, and also seriously alarmed.  He was either very unwell or"
4625,II,"going out of his mind, and it was clear, too, that he would resent any"
4626,II,"anxiety on his account.  I ransacked my memory for rumours, but found"
4627,II,none.  I had heard nothing of him except that he had been
4628,II,"extraordinarily successful in his speculations, and that from his"
4629,II,hill-top he directed his firm's operations with uncommon skill.  If
4630,II,"Lawson was sick or mad, nobody knew of it."
4631,II,
4632,II,"Dinner was a trying ceremony.  Lawson, who used to be rather particular"
4633,II,"in his dress, appeared in a kind of smoking suit with a flannel collar."
4634,II,"He spoke scarcely a word to me, but cursed the servants with a"
4635,II,brutality which left me aghast.  A wretched footman in his nervousness
4636,II,spilt some sauce over his sleeve.  Lawson dashed the dish from his hand
4637,II,"and volleyed abuse with a sort of epileptic fury.  Also he, who had"
4638,II,"been the most abstemious of men, swallowed disgusting quantities of"
4639,II,champagne and old brandy.
4640,II,
4641,II,"He had given up smoking, and half an hour after we left the dining-room"
4642,II,he announced his intention of going to bed.  I watched him as he
4643,II,waddled upstairs with a feeling of angry bewilderment.  Then I went to
4644,II,the library and lit a pipe.  I would leave first thing in the
4645,II,morning--on that I was determined.  But as I sat gazing at the moon of
4646,II,"alabaster and the soapstone birds my anger evaporated, and concern took"
4647,II,"its place.  I remembered what a fine fellow Lawson had been, what good"
4648,II,times we had had together.  I remembered especially that evening when
4649,II,we had found this valley and given rein to our fancies.  What horrid
4650,II,alchemy in the place had turned a gentleman into a brute? I thought of
4651,II,"drink and drugs and madness and insomnia, but I could fit none of them"
4652,II,into my conception of my friend.  I did not consciously rescind my
4653,II,"resolve to depart, but I had a notion that I would not act on it."
4654,II,
4655,II,"The sleepy butler met me as I went to bed.  ""Mr. Lawson's room is at"
4656,II,"the end of your corridor, sir,"" he said.  ""He don't sleep over well, so"
4657,II,you may hear him stirring in the night.  At what hour would you like
4658,II,"breakfast, sir?  Mr. Lawson mostly has his in bed."""
4659,II,
4660,II,"My room opened from the great corridor, which ran the full length of"
4661,II,"the front of the house.  So far as I could make out, Lawson was three"
4662,II,"rooms off, a vacant bedroom and his servant's room being between us.  I"
4663,II,"felt tired and cross, and tumbled into bed as fast as possible."
4664,II,"Usually I sleep well, but now I was soon conscious that my drowsiness"
4665,II,was wearing off and that I was in for a restless night.  I got up and
4666,II,"laved my face, turned the pillows, thought of sheep coming over a hill"
4667,II,and clouds crossing the sky; but none   of the old devices were of any
4668,II,use.  After about an hour of make-believe I surrendered myself to
4669,II,"facts, and, lying on my back, stared at the white ceiling and the"
4670,II,patches of moonshine on the walls.
4671,II,
4672,II,"It certainly was an amazing night.  I got up, put on a dressing-gown,"
4673,II,"and drew a chair to the window.  The moon was almost at its full, and"
4674,II,the whole plateau swam in a radiance of ivory and silver.  The banks of
4675,II,"the stream were black, but the lake had a great belt of light athwart"
4676,II,"it, which made it seem like a horizon and the rim of land beyond it"
4677,II,like a contorted cloud.  Far to the right I saw the delicate outlines
4678,II,of the little wood which I had come to think of as the Grove of
4679,II,Ashtaroth.  I listened.  There was not a sound in the air.  The land
4680,II,"seemed to sleep peacefully beneath the moon, and yet I had a sense that"
4681,II,the peace was an illusion.  The place was feverishly restless.
4682,II,
4683,II,I could have given no reason for my impression but there it was.
4684,II,Something was stirring in the wide moonlit landscape under its deep
4685,II,mask of silence.  I felt as I had felt on the evening three years ago
4686,II,"when I had ridden into the grove.  I did not think that the influence,"
4687,II,"whatever it was, was maleficent.  I only knew that it was very strange,"
4688,II,and kept me wakeful.
4689,II,
4690,II,By-and-by I bethought me of a book.  There was no lamp in the corridor
4691,II,"save the moon, but the whole house was bright as I slipped down the"
4692,II,great staircase and across the hall to the library.  I switched on the
4693,II,"lights and then switched them off.  They seemed profanation, and I did"
4694,II,not need them.
4695,II,
4696,II,"I found a French novel, but the place held me and I stayed.  I sat down"
4697,II,in an arm-chair before the fireplace and the stone birds.  Very odd
4698,II,"those gawky things, like prehistoric Great Auks, looked in the"
4699,II,moonlight.  I remember that the alabaster moon shimmered like
4700,II,"translucent pearl, and I fell to wondering about its history.  Had the"
4701,II,old Sabaens used such a jewel in their rites in the Grove of Ashtaroth?
4702,II,
4703,II,Then I heard footsteps pass the window.  A great house like this would
4704,II,"have a watchman, but these quick shuffling footsteps were surely not"
4705,II,the dull plod of a servant.  They passed on to the grass and died away.
4706,II,I began to think of getting back to my room.
4707,II,
4708,II,"In the corridor I noticed that Lawson's door was ajar, and that a light"
4709,II,had been left burning.  I had the unpardonable curiosity to peep in.
4710,II,"The room was empty, and the bed had not been slept in.  Now I knew"
4711,II,whose were the footsteps outside the library window.
4712,II,
4713,II,"I lit a reading-lamp and tried to interest myself in ""La Cruelle"
4714,II,"Enigme.""  But my wits were restless, and I could not keep my eyes on"
4715,II,the page.  I flung the book aside and sat down again by the window.
4716,II,The feeling came over me that I was sitting in a box at some play.  The
4717,II,"glen was a huge stage, and at any moment the players might appear on"
4718,II,it.  My attention was strung as high as if I had been waiting for the
4719,II,advent of some world-famous actress.  But nothing came.  Only the
4720,II,shadows shifted and lengthened as the moon moved across the sky.
4721,II,
4722,II,Then quite suddenly the restlessness left me and at the same moment the
4723,II,silence was broken by the crow of a cock and the rustling of trees in a
4724,II,"light wind.  I felt very sleepy, and was turning to bed when again I"
4725,II,heard footsteps without.  From the window I could see a figure moving
4726,II,"across the garden towards the house.  It was Lawson, got up in the sort"
4727,II,of towel dressing-gown that one wears on board ship.  He was walking
4728,II,"slowly and painfully, as if very weary.  I did not see his face, but"
4729,II,the man's whole air was that of extreme fatigue and dejection.  I
4730,II,tumbled into bed and slept profoundly till long after daylight.
4731,II,
4732,II,
4733,II,
4734,III,III
4735,III,
4736,III,The man who valeted me was Lawson's own servant.  As he was laying out
4737,III,"my clothes I asked after the health of his master, and was told that he"
4738,III,"had slept ill and would not rise till late.  Then the man, an"
4739,III,"anxious-faced Englishman, gave me some information on his own account."
4740,III,Mr. Lawson was having one of his bad turns.  It would pass away in a
4741,III,"day or two, but till it had gone he was fit for nothing.  He advised me"
4742,III,"to see Mr. Jobson, the factor, who would look to my entertainment in"
4743,III,his master's absence.
4744,III,
4745,III,"Jobson arrived before luncheon, and the sight of him was the first"
4746,III,"satisfactory thing about Welgevonden.  He was a big, gruff Scot from"
4747,III,"Roxburghshire, engaged, no doubt, by Lawson as a duty to his Border"
4748,III,"ancestry.  He had short grizzled whiskers, a weatherworn face, and a"
4749,III,"shrewd, calm blue eye.  I knew now why the place was in such perfect"
4750,III,order.
4751,III,
4752,III,"We began with sport, and Jobson explained what I could have in the way"
4753,III,"of fishing and shooting.  His exposition was brief and business-like,"
4754,III,and all the while I could see his eye searching me.  It was clear that
4755,III,he had much to say on other matters than sport.
4756,III,
4757,III,"I told him that I had come here with Lawson three years before, when he"
4758,III,"chose the site.  Jobson continued to regard me curiously.  ""I've heard"
4759,III,"tell of ye from Mr. Lawson.  Ye're an old friend of his, I understand."""
4760,III,
4761,III,"""The oldest,""  I said. ""And I am sorry to find that the place does not"
4762,III,"agree with him.  Why it doesn't I cannot imagine, for you look fit"
4763,III,"enough.  Has he been seedy for long?"""
4764,III,
4765,III,"""It comes and it goes,"" said Mr. Jobson.  ""Maybe once a month he has a"
4766,III,bad turn.  But on the whole it agrees with him badly.  He's no' the man
4767,III,"he was when I first came here."""
4768,III,
4769,III,Jobson was looking at me very seriously and frankly.  I risked a
4770,III,question.
4771,III,
4772,III,"""What do you suppose is the matter?"""
4773,III,
4774,III,"He did not reply at once, but leaned forward and tapped my knee.  ""I"
4775,III,"think it's something that doctors canna cure.  Look at me, sir.  I've"
4776,III,"always been counted a sensible man, but if I told you what was in my"
4777,III,head you would think me daft.  But I have one word for you.  Bide till
4778,III,to-night is past and then speir your question.  Maybe you and me will
4779,III,"be agreed."""
4780,III,
4781,III,The factor rose to go.  As he left the room he flung me back a remark
4782,III,"over his shoulder--""Read the eleventh chapter of the First Book of"
4783,III,"Kings."""
4784,III,
4785,III,
4786,III,After luncheon I went for a walk.  First I mounted to the crown of the
4787,III,hill and feasted my eyes on the unequalled loveliness of the view.  I
4788,III,"saw the far hills in Portuguese territory, a hundred miles away,"
4789,III,lifting up thin blue fingers into the sky.  The wind blew light and
4790,III,"fresh, and the place was fragrant with a thousand delicate scents."
4791,III,"Then I descended to the vale, and followed the stream up through the"
4792,III,"garden.  Poinsettias and oleanders were blazing in coverts, and there"
4793,III,was a paradise of tinted water-lilies in the slacker reaches.  I saw
4794,III,"good trout rise at the fly, but I did not think about fishing.  I was"
4795,III,searching my memory for a recollection which would not come.  By-and-by
4796,III,"I found myself beyond the garden, where the lawns ran to the fringe of"
4797,III,Ashtaroth's Grove.
4798,III,
4799,III,"It was like something I remembered in an old Italian picture.  Only, as"
4800,III,"my memory drew it, it should have been peopled with strange"
4801,III,"figures-nymphs dancing on the sward, and a prick-eared faun peeping"
4802,III,"from the covert.  In the warm afternoon sunlight it stood, ineffably"
4803,III,"gracious and beautiful, tantalising with a sense of some deep hidden"
4804,III,"loveliness.  Very reverently I walked between the slim trees, to where"
4805,III,the little conical tower stood half in the sun and half in shadow.
4806,III,"Then I noticed something new.  Round the tower ran a narrow path, worn"
4807,III,in the grass by human feet.  There had been no such path on my first
4808,III,"visit, for I remembered the grass growing tall to the edge of the"
4809,III,"stone.  Had the Kaffirs made a shrine of it, or were there other and"
4810,III,strange votaries?
4811,III,
4812,III,When I returned to the house I found Travers with a message for me.
4813,III,"Mr. Lawson was still in bed, but he would like me to go to him.  I"
4814,III,"found my friend sitting up and drinking strong tea,--a bad thing, I"
4815,III,"should have thought, for a man in his condition.  I remember that I"
4816,III,looked about the room for some sign of the pernicious habit of which I
4817,III,"believed him a victim.  But the place was fresh and clean, with the"
4818,III,"windows wide open, and, though I could not have given my reasons, I was"
4819,III,convinced that drugs or drink had nothing to do with the sickness.
4820,III,
4821,III,"He received me more civilly, but I was shocked by his looks.  There"
4822,III,"were great bags below his eyes, and his skin had the wrinkled puffy"
4823,III,"appearance of a man in dropsy.  His voice, too, was reedy and thin."
4824,III,Only his great eyes burned with some feverish life.
4825,III,
4826,III,"""I am a shocking bad host,"" he said, ""but I'm going to be still more"
4827,III,inhospitable.  I want you to go away.  I hate anybody here when I'm off
4828,III,"colour."""
4829,III,
4830,III,"""Nonsense,""  I said; ""you want looking after.  I want to know about"
4831,III,"this sickness.  Have you had a doctor?"""
4832,III,
4833,III,"He smiled wearily.  ""Doctors are no earthly use to me.  There's nothing"
4834,III,"much the matter I tell you.  I'll be all right in a day or two, and"
4835,III,then you can come back.  I want you to go off with Jobson and hunt in
4836,III,"the plains till the end of the week.  It will be better fun for you,"
4837,III,"and I'll feel less guilty."""
4838,III,
4839,III,"Of course I pooh-poohed the idea, and Lawson got angry.  ""Damn it,"
4840,III,"man,"" he cried, ""why do you force yourself on me when I don't want you?"
4841,III,I tell you your presence here makes me worse.  In a week I'll be as
4842,III,right as the mail and then I'll be thankful for you.  But get away now;
4843,III,"get away, I tell you."""
4844,III,
4845,III,"I saw that he was fretting himself into a passion.  ""All right,"" I said"
4846,III,"soothingly; ""Jobson and I will go off hunting.  But I am horribly"
4847,III,"anxious about you, old man."""
4848,III,
4849,III,"He lay back on his pillows.  ""You needn't trouble.  I only want a"
4850,III,"little rest.  Jobson will make all arrangements, and Travers will get"
4851,III,"you anything you want.  Good-bye."""
4852,III,
4853,III,"I saw it was useless to stay longer, so I left the room.  Outside I"
4854,III,"found the anxious-faced servant ""Look here,""  I said, ""Mr. Lawson"
4855,III,"thinks I ought to go, but I mean to stay.  Tell him I'm gone if he asks"
4856,III,"you.  And for Heaven's sake keep him in bed."""
4857,III,
4858,III,"The man promised, and I thought I saw some relief in his face."
4859,III,
4860,III,"I went to the library, and on the way remembered Jobson's remark about"
4861,III,Ist Kings.  With some searching I found a Bible and turned up the
4862,III,"passage.  It was a long screed about the misdeeds of Solomon, and I"
4863,III,"read it through without enlightenment.  I began to re-read it, and a"
4864,III,word suddenly caught my attention--
4865,III,
4866,III,"""For Solomon went after Ashtaroth, the goddess of the Zidonians."""
4867,III,
4868,III,"That was all, but it was like a key to a cipher.  Instantly there"
4869,III,flashed over my mind all that I had heard or read of that strange
4870,III,ritual which seduced Israel to sin.  I saw a sunburnt land and a people
4871,III,"vowed to the stern service of Jehovah.  But I saw, too, eyes turning"
4872,III,from the austere sacrifice to lonely hill-top groves and towers and
4873,III,"images, where dwelt some subtle and evil mystery.  I saw the fierce"
4874,III,"prophets, scourging the votaries with rods, and a nation Penitent"
4875,III,"before the Lord; but always the backsliding again, and the hankering"
4876,III,after forbidden joys.  Ashtaroth was the old goddess of the East.  Was
4877,III,it not possible that in all Semitic blood there remained transmitted
4878,III,"through the dim generations, some craving for her spell?  I thought of"
4879,III,the grandfather in the back street at Brighten and of those burning
4880,III,eyes upstairs.
4881,III,
4882,III,As I sat and mused my glance fell on the inscrutable stone birds.  They
4883,III,knew all those old secrets of joy and terror.  And that moon of
4884,III,alabaster!  Some dark priest had worn it on his forehead when he
4885,III,"worshipped, like Ahab, ""all the host of Heaven.""  And then I honestly"
4886,III,"began to be afraid.  I, a prosaic, modern Christian gentleman, a"
4887,III,"half-believer in casual faiths, was in the presence of some hoary"
4888,III,mystery of sin far older than creeds or Christendom.  There was fear in
4889,III,"my heart--a kind of uneasy disgust, and above all a nervous eerie"
4890,III,disquiet.  Now I wanted to go away and yet I was ashamed of the
4891,III,cowardly thought.  I pictured Ashtaroth's Grove with sheer horror.
4892,III,What tragedy was in the air?  What secret awaited twilight?  For the
4893,III,"night was coming, the night of the Full Moon, the season of ecstasy and"
4894,III,sacrifice.
4895,III,
4896,III,I do not know how I got through that evening.  I was disinclined for
4897,III,"dinner, so I had a cutlet in the library and sat smoking till my tongue"
4898,III,ached.  But as the hours passed a more manly resolution grew up in my
4899,III,mind.  I owed it to old friendship to stand by Lawson in this
4900,III,"extremity.  I could not interfere--God knows, his reason seemed already"
4901,III,"rocking,  but I could be at hand in case my chance came.  I determined"
4902,III,"not to undress, but to watch through the night.  I had a bath, and"
4903,III,changed into light flannels and slippers.  Then I took up my position
4904,III,"in a corner of the library close to the window, so that I could not"
4905,III,fail to hear Lawson's footsteps if he passed.
4906,III,
4907,III,"Fortunately I left the lights unlit, for as I waited I grew drowsy, and"
4908,III,"fell asleep.  When I woke the moon had risen, and I knew from the feel"
4909,III,"of the air that the hour was late.  I sat very still, straining my"
4910,III,"ears, and as I listened I caught the sound of steps.  They were"
4911,III,"crossing the hall stealthily, and nearing the library door.  I huddled"
4912,III,into my corner as Lawson entered.
4913,III,
4914,III,"He wore the same towel dressing-gown, and he moved swiftly and silently"
4915,III,as if in a trance.  I watched him take the alabaster moon from the
4916,III,mantelpiece and drop it in his pocket.  A glimpse of white skin showed
4917,III,that the gown was his only clothing.  Then he moved past me to the
4918,III,"window, opened it and went out."
4919,III,
4920,III,"Without any conscious purpose I rose and followed, kicking off my"
4921,III,"slippers that I might go quietly.  He was running, running fast, across"
4922,III,the lawns in the direction of the Grove--an odd shapeless antic in the
4923,III,"moonlight.  I stopped, for there was no cover, and I feared for his"
4924,III,reason if he saw me.  When I looked again he had disappeared among the
4925,III,trees.
4926,III,
4927,III,"I saw nothing for it but to crawl, so on my belly I wormed my way over"
4928,III,the dripping sward.  There was a ridiculous suggestion of deer-stalking
4929,III,about the game which tickled me and dispelled my uneasiness.  Almost I
4930,III,persuaded myself I was tracking an ordinary sleep-walker.  The lawns
4931,III,"were broader than I imagined, and it seemed an age before I reached the"
4932,III,edge of the Grove.  The world was so still that I appeared to be making
4933,III,a most ghastly amount of noise.  I remember that once I heard a
4934,III,"rustling in the air, and looked up to see the green doves circling"
4935,III,about the tree-tops.
4936,III,
4937,III,There was no sign of Lawson.  On the edge of the Grove I think that all
4938,III,my assurance vanished.  I could see between the trunks to the little
4939,III,"tower, but it was quiet as the grave, save for the wings above.  Once"
4940,III,more there came over me the unbearable sense of anticipation I had felt
4941,III,the night before.  My nerves tingled with mingled expectation and
4942,III,"dread.  I did not think that any harm would come to me, for the powers"
4943,III,"of the air seemed not malignant.  But I knew them for powers, and felt"
4944,III,"awed and abased.  I was in the presence of the ""host of Heaven,"" and I"
4945,III,was no stern Israelitish prophet to prevail against them.
4946,III,
4947,III,"I must have lain for hours waiting in that spectral place, my eyes"
4948,III,riveted on the tower and its golden cap of moonshine.  I remember that
4949,III,"my head felt void and light, as if my spirit were becoming disembodied"
4950,III,and leaving its dew-drenched sheath far below.  But the most curious
4951,III,"sensation was of something drawing me to the tower, something mild and"
4952,III,"kindly and rather feeble, for there was some other and stronger force"
4953,III,"keeping me back.  I yearned to move nearer, but I could not drag my"
4954,III,limbs an inch.  There was a spell somewhere which I could not break.  I
4955,III,do not think I was in any way frightened now.  The starry influence was
4956,III,"playing tricks with me, but my mind was half asleep.  Only I never took"
4957,III,"my eyes from the little tower.  I think I could not, if I had wanted to."
4958,III,
4959,III,"Then suddenly from the shadows came Lawson.  He was stark-naked, and he"
4960,III,"wore, bound across his brow, the half-moon of alabaster.  He had"
4961,III,"something, too, in his hand,--something which glittered."
4962,III,
4963,III,"He ran round the tower, crooning to himself, and flinging wild arms to"
4964,III,"the skies.  Sometimes the crooning changed to a shrill cry of passion,"
4965,III,such as a maenad may have uttered in the train of Bacchus.  I could make
4966,III,"out no words, but the sound told its own tale.  He was absorbed in some"
4967,III,"infernal ecstasy.  And as he ran, he drew his right hand across his"
4968,III,"breast and arms, and I saw that it held a knife."
4969,III,
4970,III,"I grew sick with disgust,--not terror, but honest physical loathing."
4971,III,"Lawson, gashing his fat body, affected me with an overpowering"
4972,III,"repugnance.  I wanted to go forward and stop him, and I wanted, too, to"
4973,III,be a hundred miles away.  And the result was that I stayed still.  I
4974,III,"believe my own will held me there, but I doubt if in any case I could"
4975,III,have moved my legs.
4976,III,
4977,III,The dance grew swifter and fiercer.  I saw the blood dripping from
4978,III,"Lawson's body, and his face ghastly white above his scarred breast."
4979,III,And then suddenly the horror left me; my head swam; and for one
4980,III,second--one brief second--I seemed to peer into a new world.  A strange
4981,III,passion surged up in my heart.  I seemed to see the earth peopled with
4982,III,"forms not human, scarcely divine, but more desirable than man or god."
4983,III,The calm face of Nature broke up for me into wrinkles of wild
4984,III,"knowledge.  I saw the things which brush against the soul in dreams,"
4985,III,and found them lovely.  There seemed no cruelty in the knife or the
4986,III,"blood.  It was a delicate mystery of worship, as wholesome as the"
4987,III,morning song of birds.  I do not know how the Semites found Ashtaroth's
4988,III,ritual; to them it may well have been more rapt and passionate than it
4989,III,"seemed to me.  For I saw in it only the sweet simplicity of Nature, and"
4990,III,all riddles of lust and terror soothed away as a child's nightmares are
4991,III,"calmed by a mother.  I found my legs able to move, and I think I took"
4992,III,two steps through the dusk towards the tower.
4993,III,
4994,III,"And then it all ended.  A cock crew, and the homely noises of earth"
4995,III,"were renewed.  While I stood dazed and shivering, Lawson plunged"
4996,III,"through the Grove toward me.  The impetus carried him to the edge, and"
4997,III,he fell fainting just outside the shade.
4998,III,
4999,III,My wits and common-sense came back to me with my bodily strength.  I
5000,III,"got my friend on my back, and staggered with him towards the house.  I"
5001,III,"was afraid in real earnest now, and what frightened me most was the"
5002,III,thought that I had not been afraid sooner.  I had come very near the
5003,III,"""abomination of the Zidonians."""
5004,III,
5005,III,At the door I found the scared valet waiting.  He had apparently done
5006,III,this sort of thing before.
5007,III,
5008,III,"""Your master has been sleep-walking and has had a fall,"" I said.  ""We"
5009,III,"must get him to bed at once."""
5010,III,
5011,III,"We bathed the wounds as he lay in a deep stupor, and I dressed them as"
5012,III,"well as I could.  The only danger lay in his utter exhaustion, for"
5013,III,"happily the gashes were not serious, and no artery had been touched."
5014,III,"Sleep and rest would make him well, for he had the constitution of a"
5015,III,strong man.  I was leaving the room when he opened his eyes and spoke.
5016,III,"He did not recognize me, but I noticed that his face had lost its"
5017,III,"strangeness, and was once more that of the friend I had known.  Then I"
5018,III,suddenly bethought me of an old hunting remedy which he and I always
5019,III,carried on our expeditions.  It is a pill made up from an ancient
5020,III,Portuguese prescription.  One is an excellent specific for fever.  Two
5021,III,"are invaluable if you are lost in the bush, for they send a man for"
5022,III,"many hours into a deep sleep, which prevents suffering and madness,"
5023,III,till help comes.  Three give a painless death.  I went to my room and
5024,III,"found the little box in my jewel-case.  Lawson swallowed two, and"
5025,III,"turned wearily on his side.  I bade his man let him sleep till he woke,"
5026,III,and went off in search of food.
5027,III,
5028,III,
5029,III,
5030,IV,IV
5031,IV,
5032,IV,"I had business on hand which would not wait.  By seven, Jobson, who had"
5033,IV,"been sent for, was waiting for me in the library.  I knew by his grim"
5034,IV,face that here I had a very good substitute for a prophet of the Lord.
5035,IV,
5036,IV,"""You were right,""  I said.  ""I have read the 11th chapter of Ist Kings,"
5037,IV,and I have spent such a night as I pray God I shall never spend again.
5038,IV,
5039,IV,"""I thought you would,"" he replied.  ""I've had the same experience"
5040,IV,"myself."""
5041,IV,
5042,IV,"""The Grove?""  I said."
5043,IV,
5044,IV,"""Ay, the wud,"" was the answer in broad Scots."
5045,IV,
5046,IV,"I wanted to see how much he understood.  ""Mr. Lawson's family is from"
5047,IV,"the Scottish Border?"""
5048,IV,
5049,IV,"""Ay.  I understand they come off Borthwick Water side,"" he replied, but"
5050,IV,I saw by his eyes that he knew what I meant.
5051,IV,
5052,IV,"""Mr. Lawson is my oldest friend,""  I went on, ""and I am going to take"
5053,IV,measures to cure him.  For what I am going to do I take the sole
5054,IV,responsibility.  I will make that plain to your master.  But if I am to
5055,IV,succeed I want your help. Will you give it me?  It sounds like madness
5056,IV,and you are a sensible man and may like to keep out of it.  I leave it
5057,IV,"to your discretion."""
5058,IV,
5059,IV,"Jobson looked me straight in the face.  ""Have no fear for me,"" he said;"
5060,IV,"""there is an unholy thing in that place, and if I have the strength in"
5061,IV,"me I will destroy it.  He has been a good master to me, and, forbye I"
5062,IV,"am a believing Christian.  So say on, sir."""
5063,IV,
5064,IV,There was no mistaking the air.  I had found my Tishbite.
5065,IV,
5066,IV,"""I want men,""  I said, ""--as many as we can get."""
5067,IV,
5068,IV,"Jobson mused. ""The Kaffirs will no' gang near the place, but there's"
5069,IV,"some thirty white men on the tobacco farm.  They'll do your will, if"
5070,IV,"you give them an indemnity in writing."""
5071,IV,
5072,IV,"""Good,"" said I.  ""Then we will take our instructions from the only"
5073,IV,authority which meets the case.  We will follow the example of King
5074,IV,"Josiah.  I turned up the 23rd chapter of end Kings, and read--"
5075,IV,
5076,IV,"""And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the"
5077,IV,"right hand of the Mount of Corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel"
5078,IV,had builded for Ashtaroth the abomination of the Zidonians ... did the
5079,IV,king defile.
5080,IV,
5081,IV,"""And he brake in Pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and"
5082,IV,filled their places with the bones of men....'
5083,IV,
5084,IV,"""Moreover the altar that was at Beth-el, and the high place which"
5085,IV,"Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that"
5086,IV,"altar and the high place he brake down, and burned the high place, and"
5087,IV,"stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove."""
5088,IV,
5089,IV,"Jobson nodded.  ""It'll need dinnymite.  But I've plenty of yon down at"
5090,IV,"the workshops.  I'll be off to collect the lads."""
5091,IV,
5092,IV,
5093,IV,Before nine the men had assembled at Jobson's house.  They were a hardy
5094,IV,"lot of young farmers from home, who took their instructions docilely"
5095,IV,from the masterful factor.  On my orders they had brought their
5096,IV,"shotguns.  We armed them with spades and woodmen's axes, and one man"
5097,IV,wheeled some coils of rope in a handcart.
5098,IV,
5099,IV,"In the clear, windless air of morning the Grove, set amid its lawns,"
5100,IV,looked too innocent and exquisite for ill.  I had a pang of regret that
5101,IV,"a thing so fair should suffer; nay,  if I had come alone, I think I"
5102,IV,"might have repented.  But the men were there, and the grim-faced Jobson"
5103,IV,"was waiting for orders.  I placed the guns, and sent beaters to the far"
5104,IV,side.  I told them that every dove must be shot.
5105,IV,
5106,IV,"It was only a small flock, and we killed fifteen at the first drive."
5107,IV,"The poor birds flew over the glen to another spinney, but we brought"
5108,IV,them back over the guns and seven fell.  Four more were got in the
5109,IV,"trees, and the last I killed myself with a long shot.  In half an hour"
5110,IV,there was a pile of little green bodies on the sward.
5111,IV,
5112,IV,Then we went to work to cut down the trees.  The slim stems were an
5113,IV,"easy task to a good woodman, and one after another they toppled to the"
5114,IV,"ground.  And meantime, as I watched, I became conscious of a strange"
5115,IV,emotion.
5116,IV,
5117,IV,"It was as if someone were pleading with me.  A gentle voice, not"
5118,IV,"threatening, but pleading--something too fine for the sensual ear, but"
5119,IV,touching inner chords of the spirit.  So tenuous it was and distant
5120,IV,that I could think of no personality behind it.  Rather it was the
5121,IV,"viewless, bodiless grace of this delectable vale, some old exquisite"
5122,IV,"divinity of the groves.  There was the heart of all sorrow in it, and"
5123,IV,"the soul of all loveliness.  It seemed a woman's voice, some lost lady"
5124,IV,who had brought nothing but goodness unrepaid to the world.  And what
5125,IV,the voice told me was that I was destroying her last shelter.
5126,IV,
5127,IV,That was the pathos of it--the voice was homeless.  As the axes flashed
5128,IV,"in the sunlight and the wood grew thin, that gentle spirit was pleading"
5129,IV,with me for mercy and a brief respite.  It seemed to be telling of a
5130,IV,"world for centuries grown coarse and pitiless, of long sad wanderings,"
5131,IV,"of hardly-won shelter, and a peace which was the little all she sought"
5132,IV,from men.  There was nothing terrible in it.  No thought of
5133,IV,"wrong-doing.  The spell, which to Semitic blood held the mystery of"
5134,IV,"evil, was to me, of the Northern race, only delicate and rare and"
5135,IV,"beautiful.  Jobson and the rest did not feel it, I with my finer senses"
5136,IV,caught nothing but the hopeless sadness of it.  That which had stirred
5137,IV,the passion in Lawson was only wringing my heart.  It was almost too
5138,IV,pitiful to bear.  As the trees crashed down and the men wiped the sweat
5139,IV,"from their brows, I seemed to myself like the murderer of fair women"
5140,IV,and innocent children.  I remember that the tears were running over my
5141,IV,"cheeks.  More than once I opened my mouth to countermand the work, but"
5142,IV,"the face of Jobson, that grim Tishbite, held me back."
5143,IV,
5144,IV,"I knew now what gave the Prophets of the Lord their mastery, and I knew"
5145,IV,also why the people sometimes stoned them.
5146,IV,
5147,IV,"The last tree fell, and the little tower stood like a ravished shrine,"
5148,IV,stripped of all defence against the world.  I heard Jobson's voice
5149,IV,"speaking.  ""We'd better blast that stane thing now.  We'll trench on"
5150,IV,"four sides and lay the dinnymite.  Ye're no' looking weel, sir.  Ye'd"
5151,IV,"better go and sit down on the braeface."""
5152,IV,
5153,IV,"I went up the hillside and lay down.  Below me, in the waste of shorn"
5154,IV,"trunks, men were running about, and I saw the mining begin.  It all"
5155,IV,seemed like an aimless dream in which I had no part.  The voice of that
5156,IV,homeless goddess was still pleading.  It was the innocence of it that
5157,IV,tortured me Even so must a merciful Inquisitor have suffered from the
5158,IV,plea of some fair girl with the aureole of death on her hair.  I knew I
5159,IV,was killing rare and unrecoverable beauty.  As I sat dazed and
5160,IV,"heartsick, the whole loveliness of Nature seemed to plead for its"
5161,IV,"divinity.  The sun in the heavens, the mellow lines of upland, the blue"
5162,IV,"mystery of the far plains, were all part of that soft voice.  I felt"
5163,IV,"bitter scorn for myself.  I was guilty of blood; nay, I was guilty of"
5164,IV,the sin against light which knows no forgiveness.  I was murdering
5165,IV,innocent gentleness--and there would be no peace on earth for me.  Yet
5166,IV,I sat helpless.  The power of a sterner will constrained me.  And all
5167,IV,the while the voice was growing fainter and dying away into unutterable
5168,IV,sorrow.
5169,IV,
5170,IV,"Suddenly a great flame sprang to heaven, and a pall of smoke.  I heard"
5171,IV,"men crying out, and fragments of stone fell around the ruins of the"
5172,IV,"grove.  When the air cleared, the little tower had gone out of sight."
5173,IV,
5174,IV,The voice had ceased and there seemed to me to be a bereaved silence in
5175,IV,"the world.  The shock moved me to my feet, and I ran down the slope to"
5176,IV,where Jobson stood rubbing his eyes.
5177,IV,
5178,IV,"""That's done the job.  Now we maun get up the tree roots.  We've no"
5179,IV,"time to howk.  We'll just blast the feck o' them."""
5180,IV,
5181,IV,"The work of destruction went on, but I was coming back to my senses.  I"
5182,IV,forced myself to be practical and reasonable.  I thought of the night's
5183,IV,"experience and Lawson's haggard eyes, and I screwed myself into a"
5184,IV,determination to see the thing through.  I had done the deed; it was my
5185,IV,business to make it complete.  A text in Jeremiah came into my head:
5186,IV,
5187,IV,"""Their children remember their altars and their groves by the green"
5188,IV,"trees upon the high hills."""
5189,IV,
5190,IV,I would see to it that this grove should be utterly forgotten.
5191,IV,
5192,IV,"We blasted the tree-roots, and, yolking oxen, dragged the debris into a"
5193,IV,"great heap.  Then the men set to work with their spades, and roughly"
5194,IV,"levelled the ground.  I was getting back to my old self, and Jobson's"
5195,IV,spirit was becoming mine.
5196,IV,
5197,IV,"""There is one thing more,""  I told him  ""Get ready a couple of ploughs."
5198,IV,"We will improve upon King Josiah.""   My brain was a medley of Scripture"
5199,IV,"precedents, and I was determined that no safeguard should be wanting."
5200,IV,
5201,IV,We yoked the oxen again and drove the ploughs over the site of the
5202,IV,"grove.  It was rough ploughing, for the place was thick with bits of"
5203,IV,"stone from the tower, but the slow Afrikaner oxen plodded on, and"
5204,IV,sometime in the afternoon the work was finished.  Then I sent down to
5205,IV,"the farm for bags of rock-salt, such as they use for cattle.  Jobson"
5206,IV,"and I took a sack apiece, and walked up and down the furrows, sowing"
5207,IV,them with salt.
5208,IV,
5209,IV,The last act was to set fire to the pile of tree trunks.  They burned
5210,IV,"well, and on the top we flung the bodies of the green doves.  The birds"
5211,IV,of Ashtaroth had an honourable pyre.
5212,IV,
5213,IV,"Then I dismissed the much-perplexed men, and gravely shook hands with"
5214,IV,"Jobson.  Black with dust and smoke I went back to the house, where I"
5215,IV,bade Travers pack my bags and order the motor.  I found Lawson's
5216,IV,"servant, and heard from him that his master was sleeping peacefully.  I"
5217,IV,"gave him some directions, and then went to wash and change."
5218,IV,
5219,IV,Before I left I wrote a line to Lawson.  I began by transcribing the
5220,IV,"verses from the 23rd chapter of 2nd Kings.  I told him what I had done,"
5221,IV,"and my reason.  ""I take the whole responsibility upon myself,""  I"
5222,IV,"wrote.  ""No man in the place had anything to do with it but me.  I"
5223,IV,"acted as I did for the sake of our old friendship, and you will believe"
5224,IV,it was no easy task for me.  I hope you will understand.  Whenever you
5225,IV,"are able to see me send me word, and I will come back and settle with"
5226,IV,"you.  But I think you will realise that I have saved your soul."""
5227,IV,
5228,IV,The afternoon was merging into twilight as I left the house on the road
5229,IV,"to Taqui.  The great fire, where the Grove had been, was still blazing"
5230,IV,"fiercely, and the smoke made a cloud over the upper glen, and filled"
5231,IV,all the air with a soft violet haze.  I knew that I had done well for
5232,IV,"my friend, and that he would come to his senses and be grateful.  My"
5233,IV,"mind was at ease on that score, and in something like comfort I faced"
5234,IV,the future.  But as the car reached the ridge I looked back to the vale
5235,IV,"I had outraged.  The moon was rising and silvering the smoke, and"
5236,IV,"through the gaps I could see the tongues of fire.  Somehow, I know not"
5237,IV,"why, the lake, the stream, the garden-coverts, even the green slopes of"
5238,IV,"hill, wore an air of loneliness and desecration.  And then my heartache"
5239,IV,"returned, and I knew that I had driven something lovely and adorable"
5240,IV,from its last refuge on earth.

5327,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"him that Marion was drowsing, so he slipped to the door."
5328,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5329,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"Outside, as he had said, the sky was clear.  From the plashy hillside"
5330,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,came the rumour of swollen burns.  Then he was aware of a man's voice
5331,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,shouting.
5332,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5333,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"""Sim,"" it cried, ""Sim o' the Cleuch ...  Sim.""  A sturdy figure came"
5334,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,down through the scrog of hazel and revealed itself as his neighbour of
5335,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"the Dodhead.  Jamie Telfer lived five miles off in Ettrick, but his was"
5336,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"the next house to the Cleuch shieling.  Telfer was running, and his"
5337,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,round red face shone with sweat.
5338,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5339,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"""Dod, man, Sim, ye're hard o' hearing.  I was routin' like to wake the"
5340,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"deid, and ye never turned your neck.  It's the fray I bring ye.  Mount"
5341,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,and ride to the Carewoodrig.  The word's frae Branksome.  I've but
5342,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"Ranklehope to raise, and then me and William's Tam will be on the road"
5343,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"to join ye."""
5344,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5345,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"""Whatna fray?"" Sim asked blankly."
5346,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5347,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"""Ninemileburn.  Bewcastle's marching.  They riped the place at"
5348,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"cockcrow, and took twenty-six kye, five horse and a walth o'"

5350,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"they're gaun round by Ewes Water, for they durstna try the Hermitage"
5351,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"Slack.  Forbye they move slow, for the bestial's heavy wark to drive."
5352,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"They shut up Wat in the auld peel, and he didna win free till bye"
5353,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"midday.  Syne he was off to Branksome, and the word frae Branksome is"
5354,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"to raise a' Ettrick, Teviotdale, Ale Water, and the Muirs o' Esk.  We"
5355,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"look to win up wi' the lads long ere they cross Liddel, and that at the"
5356,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,speed they gang will be gey an' near sunrise.  It's a braw mune for the
5357,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"job."""
5358,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5359,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,Jarnie Telfer lay on his face by the burn and lapped up water like a
5360,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,dog.  Then without another word he trotted off across the hillside
5361,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,beyond which lay the Ranklehope.
5362,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5363,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,Sim had a fit of coughing and looked stupidly at the sky.  Here was the
5364,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"last straw.  He was dog-tired, for he had had little sleep the past"
5365,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"week.  There was no one to leave with Marion, and Marion was too weak"
5366,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"to tend herself.  The word was from Branksome, and at another time"
5367,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,Branksome was to be obeyed.  But now the thing was past reason.  What
5368,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"use was there for a miserable careworn man to ride among the swank,"
5369,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,well-fed lads in the Bewcastle chase?  And then he remembered his cow.
5370,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,She would be hirpling with the rest of the Ninemileburn beasts on the
5371,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,road to the Border.  The case was more desperate than he had thought.
5372,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,She was gone for ever unless he helped Wat to win her back.  And if she
5373,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"went, where was the milk for the child?"
5374,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5375,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,He stared hopelessly up at a darkening sky.  Then he went to the
5376,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"lean-to where his horse was stalled.  The beast was fresh, for it had"
5377,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,not been out for two days--a rough Forest shelty with shaggy fetlocks
5378,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"and a mane like a thicket.  Sim set his old saddle on it, and went back"
5379,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,to the house.
5380,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5381,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"His wife was still asleep, breathing painfully.  He put water on the"
5382,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"fire to boil, and fetched a handful of meal from the ark.  With this he"
5383,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"made a dish of gruel, and set it by the bedside.  He drew a pitcher of"
5384,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"water from the well, for she might be thirsty.  Then he banked up the"
5385,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,fire and steeked the window.  When she woke she would find food and
5386,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"drink, and he would be back before the next darkening.  He dared not"
5387,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,look at the child.
5388,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5389,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"The shelty shied at a line of firelight from the window, as Sim flung"
5390,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,himself wearily on its back.  He had got his long ash spear from its
5391,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"place among the rafters, and donned his leather jacket with the iron"
5392,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,studs on breast and shoulder.  One of the seams gaped.  His wife had
5393,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,been mending it when her pains took her.
5394,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5395,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,He had ridden by Commonside and was high on the Caerlanrig before he
5396,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"saw signs of men.  The moon swam in a dim dark sky, and the hills were"
5397,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,as yellow as corn.  The round top of the Wisp made a clear mark to ride
5398,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"by.  Sim was a nervous man, and at another time would never have dared"
5399,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"to ride alone by the ruined shieling of Chasehope, where folk said a"
5400,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,witch had dwelt long ago and the Devil still came in the small hours.
5401,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,But now he was too full of his cares to have room for dread.  With his
5402,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,head on his breast he let the shelty take its own road through the
5403,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,mosses.
5404,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5405,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,But on the Caerlanrig he came on a troop of horse.  They were a lusty
5406,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"crowd, well-mounted and armed, with iron basnets and corselets that"
5407,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"jingled as they rode.  Harden's men, he guessed, with young Harden at"
5408,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,the head of them.  They cried him greeting as he fell in at the tail.
5409,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"""It's Long Sim o' the Cleuch,"" one said; ""he's sib to Wat or he wadna"
5410,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"be here.  Sim likes his ain fireside better than the 'Bateable Land'."""
5411,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5412,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"The companionship of others cheered him.  There had been a time, before"
5413,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"he brought Marion from Megget, when he was a well kenned figure on the"
5414,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"Borders, a good man at weaponshows and a fierce fighter when his blood"
5415,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,was up.  Those days were long gone; but the gusto of them returned.  No
5416,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,man had ever lightlied him without paying scot.  He held up his head
5417,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,and forgot his cares and his gaping jackets.  In a little they had
5418,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"topped the hill, and were looking down on the young waters of Ewes."
5419,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5420,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"The company grew, as men dropped in from left and right.  Sim"
5421,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"recognised the wild hair of Charlie of Geddinscleuch, and the square"
5422,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"shoulders of Adam of Frodslaw.  They passed Mosspaul, a twinkle far"
5423,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"down in the glen, and presently came to the long green slope which is"
5424,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"called the Carewoodrig, and which makes a pass from Ewes to Hermitage."
5425,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,To Sim it seemed that an army had encamped on it.  Fires had been lit
5426,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"in a howe, and wearied men slept by them.  These were the runners, who"
5427,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,all day had been warning the dales.  By one fire stood the great figure
5428,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"of Wat o' the Ninemileburn, blaspheming to the skies and counting his"
5429,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"losses.  He had girded on a long sword, and for better precaution had"
5430,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,slung an axe on his back.  At the sight of young Harden he held his
5431,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,peace.  The foray was Branksome's and a Scott must lead.
5432,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5433,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"Dimly and stupidly, for he was very weary, Sim heard word of the enemy."
5434,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"The beasts had travelled slow, and would not cross Liddel till sunrise."
5435,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"Now they were high up on Tarras water, making for Liddel at a ford"
5436,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"below the Castletown.  There had been no time to warn the Elliots, but"
5437,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,the odds were that Lariston and Mangerton would be out by morning.
5438,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5439,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"""Never heed the Elliots,"" cried young Harden.  ""We can redd our ain"
5440,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"frays, lads.  Haste and ride, and we'll hae Geordie Musgrave long ere"
5441,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"he wins to the Ritterford, Borrowstonemoss is the bit for us.""   And"
5442,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,with a light Scott laugh he was in the saddle.
5443,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5444,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"They were now in a land of low hills, which made ill-going.  A"
5445,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,companion gave Sim the news.  Bewcastle and five-score men and the
5446,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"Scots four-score and three.  ""It's waur to haul than to win,"" said the"
5447,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"man.  ""Ae man can take ten beasts when three 'ill no keep them."
5448,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"There'll be bluidy war on Tarras side ere the nicht's dune."""
5449,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5450,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,Sim was feeling his weariness too sore for speech.  He remembered that
5451,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,he had tasted no food for fifteen hours.  He found his meal-poke and
5452,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"filled his mouth, but the stuff choked him.  It only made him cough"
5453,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"fiercely, so that Wat o' the Ninemileburn, riding before him, cursed"
5454,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"him for a broken-winded fool.  Also he was remembering about Marion,"
5455,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,lying sick in the darkness twenty miles over the hills.
5456,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5457,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"The moon was clouded, for an east wind was springing up.  It was ill"
5458,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"riding on the braeface, and Sim and his shelty floundered among the"
5459,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,screes.  He was wondering how long it would all last.  Soon he must
5460,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,fall down and be the scorn of the Border men.  The thought put Marion
5461,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,out of his head again.  He set his mind on tending his horse and
5462,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,keeping up with his fellows.
5463,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5464,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,Suddenly a whistle from Harden halted the company.  A man came running
5465,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,back from the crown of the rig.  A whisper went about that Bewcastle
5466,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"was on the far side, in the little glen called the Brunt Burn.  The men"
5467,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"held their breath, and in the stillness they heard far off the sound of"
5468,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,hooves on stones and the heavy breathing of cattle.
5469,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5470,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,It was a noble spot for an ambuscade.  The Borderers scattered over the
5471,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"hillside, some riding south to hold the convoy as it came down the"
5472,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,glen.  Sim's weariness lightened.  His blood ran quicker; he remembered
5473,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"that the cow, his child's one hope, was there before him.  He found"
5474,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"himself next his cousin Wat, who chewed curses in his great beard."
5475,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,When they topped the rig they saw a quarter of a mile below them the
5476,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"men they sought.  The cattle were driven in the centre, with horsemen"
5477,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,in front and rear and flankers on the braeside.
5478,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5479,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"""Hae at them, lads,"" cried Wat o' the Ninemileburn, as he dug spurs"
5480,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,into his grey horse.  From farther down the glen he was answered with a
5481,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"great shout of ""Branksome""."
5482,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5483,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,Somehow or other Sim and his shelty got down the steep braeface.  The
5484,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,next he knew was that the raiders had turned to meet him--to meet him
5485,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"alone, it seemed; the moon had  come out again, and their faces showed"
5486,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"white in it.  The cattle, as the driving ceased, sank down wearily in"
5487,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"the moss.  A man with an iron ged turned, cursing to receive Wat's"
5488,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,sword on his shoulder-bone.  A light began to blaze from down the
5489,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,burn--Sim saw the glitter of it out of the corner of an eye--but the
5490,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,men in front were dark figures with white faces.
5491,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5492,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"The Bewcastle lads were stout fellows, well used to hold as well as"
5493,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"take.  They closed up in line around the beasts, and the moon lit the"
5494,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"tops of their spears.  Sim brandished his ash-shaft, which had weighed"
5495,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"heavily these last hours, and to his surprise found it light.  He found"
5496,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"his voice, too, and fell a-roaring like Wat."
5497,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5498,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"Before he knew he was among the cattle.  Wat had broken the ring, and"
5499,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,men were hacking and slipping among the slab sides of the wearied
5500,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"beasts.  The shelty came down over the rump of a red bullock, and Sim"
5501,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"was sprawling on his face in the trampled grass.  He struggled to rise,"
5502,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,and some one had him by the throat.
5503,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5504,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,Anger fired his slow brain.  He reached out his long arms and grappled
5505,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"a leather jerkin.  His nails found a seam and rent it, for he had"
5506,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"mighty fingers.  Then he was gripping warm flesh, tearing it like a"
5507,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"wild beast, and his assailant with a cry slackened his hold.  ""Whatna"
5508,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"wull-cat..."" he began, but he got no further.  The hoof of Wat's horse"
5509,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,came down on his head and brained him.  A splatter of blood fell on
5510,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,Sim's face.
5511,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5512,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"The man was half wild.  His shelty had broken back for the hill, but"
5513,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"his spear lay a yard off.  He seized it and got to his feet, to find"
5514,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,that Wat had driven the English over the burn.  The cattle were losing
5515,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"their weariness in panic, and tossing wild manes among the Scots.  It"
5516,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,was like a fight in a winter's byre.  The glare on the right grew
5517,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"fiercer, and young Harden's voice rose, clear as a bell, above the"
5518,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,tumult.  He was swearing by the cross of his sword.
5519,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5520,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"On foot, in the old Border way, Sim followed in Wat's wake, into the"
5521,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"bog and beyond the burn.  He laired to his knees, but he scarcely"
5522,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"heeded it.  There was a big man before him, a foolish, red-haired"
5523,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"fellow, who was making great play with a cudgel.  He had shivered two"
5524,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,spears and was singing low to himself.  Farther off Wat had his axe in
5525,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,hand and was driving the enemy to the brae.  There were dead men in the
5526,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"moss.  Sim stumbled over a soft body, and a hand caught feebly at his"
5527,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"heel.  ""To me, lads,"" cried Wat.  ""Anither birse and we hae them"
5528,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"broken."""
5529,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5530,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,But something happened.  Harden was pushing the van of the raiders up
5531,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"the stream, and a press of them surged in from the right.  Wat found"
5532,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"himself assailed on his flank, and gave ground.  The big man with the"
5533,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"cudgel laughed loud and ran down the hill, and the Scots fell back on"
5534,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"Sim.  Men tripped over him, and as he rose he found the giant above him"
5535,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,with his stick in the air.
5536,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5537,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"The blow fell, glancing from the ash-shaft to Sim's side.  Something"
5538,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,cracked and his left arm hung limp.  But the furies of hell had hold of
5539,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"him now.  He rolled over, gripped his spear short, and with a swift"
5540,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,turn struck upwards.  The big man gave a sob and toppled down into a
5541,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,pool of the burn.
5542,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5543,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"Sim struggled to his feet, and saw that the raiders were beginning to"
5544,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,hough the cattle One man was driving a red spear into a helpless beast.
5545,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"It might have been the Cleuch cow.  The sight maddened him, and like a"
5546,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,destroying angel he was among them.  One man he caught full in the
5547,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"throat, and had to set a foot on breast before he could tug the spear"
5548,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"out.  Then the head shivered on a steel corselet, and Sim played"
5549,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,quarterstaff with the shaft.  The violence of his onslaught turned the
5550,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"tide.  Those whom Harden drove up were caught in a vice, and squeezed"
5551,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"out, wounded and dying and mad with fear, on to the hill above the"
5552,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"burn.  Both sides were weary men, or there would have been a grim"
5553,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"slaughter.  As it was, none followed the runners, and every now and"
5554,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"again a Scot would drop like a log, not from wounds but from dead"
5555,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,weariness.
5556,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5557,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,Harden's flare was dying down.  Dawn was breaking and Sim's wild eyes
5558,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"cleared.  Here a press of cattle, dazed with fright, and the red and"
5559,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,miry heather.  Queer black things were curled and stretched athwart it.
5560,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"He noticed a dead man beside him, perhaps of his own slaying.  It was a"
5561,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"shabby fellow, in a jacket that gaped like Sim's.  His face was thin"
5562,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"and patient, and his eyes, even in death, looked puzzled and"
5563,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"reproachful.  He would be one of the plain folk who had to ride,"
5564,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"willy-nilly, on bigger men's quarrels.  Sim found himself wondering if"
5565,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"he, also, had a famished wife and child at home.  The fury of the night"
5566,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"had gone, and Sim began to sob from utter tiredness."
5567,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5568,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,He slept in what was half a swoon.  When he woke the sun was well up in
5569,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"the sky and the Scots were cooking food.  His arm irked him, and his"
5570,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,head burned like fire.  He felt his body and found nothing worse than
5571,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"bruises, and one long shallow scar where his jacket was torn."
5572,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5573,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,A Teviotdale man brought him a cog of brose.  Sim stared at it and
5574,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"sickened:  he was too far gone for food.  Young Harden passed, and"
5575,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"looked curiously at him.  ""Here's a man that has na spared himsel',"" he"
5576,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"said.  ""A drop o' French cordial is the thing for you, Sim.""  And out"
5577,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,of a leathern flask he poured a little draught which he bade Sim
5578,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,swallow.
5579,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5580,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,The liquor ran through his veins and lightened the ache of his head.
5581,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,He found strength to rise and look round.  Surely they were short of
5582,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,men.  If these were all that were left Bewcastle had been well avenged.

5584,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"Jamie Telfer enlightened him.  ""When we had gotten the victory, there"
5585,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,were some o' the lads thocht that Bewcastle sud pay scot in beasts as
5586,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,weel as men.  Sae Wat and a score mair rade off to lowse Geordie
5587,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"Musgrave's kye.  The road's clear, and they'll be back ower Liddell by"
5588,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"this time.  Dod, there'll be walth o' plenishin' at the Ninemileburn."""
5589,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5590,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,Sim was cheered by the news.  If Wat got back more than his own he
5591,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"might be generous.  They were cooking meat round the fire, the flesh of"
5592,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"the cattle killed in the fight.  He went down to the nearest blaze, and"
5593,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,was given a strip of roast which he found he could swallow.
5594,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5595,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"""How mony beasts were killed?"" he asked incuriously, and was told"
5596,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,three.  Saugh poles had been set up to hang the skins on.  A notion
5597,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,made Sim stagger to his feet and go to inspect them.  There could be no
5598,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,mistake.  There hung the brindled hide of Marion's cow.
5599,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5600,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"Wat returned in a cloud of glory, driving three-and-twenty English"
5601,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,beasts before him--great white fellows that none could match on the
5602,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"Scottish side.  He and his lads clamoured for food, so more flesh was"
5603,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"roasted, till the burnside smelt like a kitchen.  The Scots had found"
5604,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"better than cattle, for five big skins of ale bobbed on their saddles."
5605,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"Wat summoned all to come and drink, and Harden, having no fear of"
5606,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"reprisals, did not forbid it."
5607,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5608,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,Sim was becoming a man again.  He had bathed his bruises and scratches
5609,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"in the burn, and Will o' Phawhope, who had skill as a leech, had set"
5610,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,his arm and bound it to his side in splints of ash and raw hide.  He
5611,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"had eaten grossly of flesh--the first time since the spring, and then"
5612,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,it had only been braxy lamb.  The ale had warmed his blood and
5613,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,quickened his wits.  He began to feel pleased with himself.  He had
5614,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,done well in the fray--had not young Harden praised him?--and surly Wat
5615,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"had owned that the salvage of so many beasts was Sim's doing. ""Man,"
5616,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"Sim, ye wrocht michtily at the burnside,"" he had said.  ""The heids"
5617,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,crackit like nits when ye garred your staff sing.  Better you wi' a
5618,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"stick than anither than wi' a sword.""  It was fine praise, and warmed"
5619,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"Sim's chilly soul.  For a year he had fought bitterly for bread, and"
5620,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,now glory had come to him without asking.
5621,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5622,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"Men were drawn by lot to drive the cattle, and others to form a"
5623,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,rearguard.  The rest set off for their homes by the nearest road.  The
5624,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"shelty had been recovered, and Sim to his pride found himself riding in"
5625,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,the front with Wat and young Harden and others of the Scott and Elliot
5626,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,gentry.
5627,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5628,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,The company rode fast over the green hills in the clear autumn noon.
5629,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"Harden's blue eyes danced, and he sang snatches in his gay voice.  Wat"
5630,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,rumbled his own praises and told of the raid over Liddel.  Sim felt a
5631,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,new being from the broken man who the night before had wearily jogged
5632,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,on the same road.  He told himself he took life too gravely and let
5633,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,care ride him too hard.  He was too much thirled to the Cleuch and tied
5634,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"to his wife's apron.  In the future he would see his friends, and bend"
5635,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,the bicker with the rest of them.
5636,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5637,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"By the darkening they had come to Ninemileburn, where Harden's road"
5638,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"left theirs.  Wat had them all into the bare dwelling, and another skin"
5639,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"of ale was broached.  A fire was lit and the men sprawled around it,"
5640,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"singing songs.  Then tales began, and they would have sat till morning,"
5641,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"had not Harden called them to the road.  Sim, too, got to his feet.  He"
5642,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"was thinking of the six miles yet before him, and as home grew nearer"
5643,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,his spirits sank.  Dimly he remembered the sad things that waited his
5644,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,homecoming.
5645,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5646,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"Wat made him a parting speech.  ""Gude e'en to ye, Cousin Sim.  Ye've"
5647,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,been a kind man to me the day.  May I do as weel by you if ever the
5648,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"fray gangs by the Cleuch.  I had a coo o' yours in pledge, and it was"
5649,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,ane o the beasts the Musgraves speared.  By the auld law your debt
5650,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"still stands, and if I likit I could seek anither pledge.  But there'll"
5651,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"be something awin' for rescue-shot, and wi' that and the gude wark"
5652,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"ye've dune the day, I'm content to ca' the debt paid."""
5653,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5654,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"Wat's words sounded kind, and no doubt Wat thought himself generous."
5655,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,Sim had it on his tongue to ask for a cow--even on a month's loan.  But
5656,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,pride choked his speech.  It meant telling of the pitiful straits at
5657,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,the Cleuch.  After what had passed he must hold his head high amongst
5658,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"those full-fed Branksome lads.  He thanked Wat, cried farewell to the"
5659,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"rest, and mounted his shelty."
5660,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5661,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,The moon was rising and the hills were yellow as corn.  The shelty had
5662,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"had a feed of oats, and capered at the shadows.  What with  excitement,"
5663,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"meat and ale, and the dregs of a great fatigue, Sim's mind was hazy,"
5664,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,and his cheerfulness returned.  He thought only on his exploits.  He
5665,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"had done great things--he, Sim o' the Cleuch--and every man in the"
5666,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,Forest would hear of them and praise his courage.  There would be
5667,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,ballads made about him; he could hear the blind violer at the Ashkirk
5668,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,change-house singing--songs which told how Sim o' the Cleuch smote
5669,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"Bewcastle in the howe of the Brunt Burn--ash against steel, one against"
5670,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"ten. The fancy intoxicated him; he felt as if he, too, could make a"
5671,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,ballad. It would speak of the soft shiny night with the moon high in
5672,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,the heavens.  It would tell of the press of men and beasts by the
5673,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"burnside, and the red glare of Harden's fires, and Wat with his axe,"
5674,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"and above all of Sim with his ash-shaft and his long arms, and how"
5675,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,Harden drove the raiders up the burn and Sim smote them silently among
5676,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"the cattle. Wat's exploits would come in, but the true glory was Sim's."
5677,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,But for him Scots saddles might have been empty and every beast safe
5678,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,over Liddel.
5679,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5680,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,The picture fairly ravished him.  It carried him over the six miles of
5681,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,bent and down by the wood of hazel to where the Cleuch lay huddled in
5682,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,its nook of hill.  It brought him to the door of his own silent
5683,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,dwelling.  As he pushed into the darkness his heart suddenly sank...
5684,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5685,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,With fumbling hands he kindled a rushlight.  The peat fire had long
5686,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,gone out and left only a heap of white ashes.  The gruel by the bed had
5687,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,been spilled and was lying on the floor.  Only the jug of water was
5688,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,drained to the foot.
5689,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5690,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,His wife lay so still that he wondered.  A red spot burned in each
5691,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"cheek, and, as he bent down, he could hear her fast breathing.  He"
5692,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,flashed the light on her eyes and she slowly opened them.
5693,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5694,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,"""The coo, Sim,"" she said faintly. ""Hae ye brocht the coo?"""
5695,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,
5696,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,The rushlight dropped on the floor. Now he knew the price of his
5697,THE RIDING OF NINEMILEBURN,riding.  He fell into a fit of coughing.

5818,--PERSIAN PROVERB,Spring-fishing in the North is a cold game for a man whose blood has
5819,--PERSIAN PROVERB,become thin in gentler climates.  All afternoon I had failed to stir a
5820,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"fish, and the wan streams of the Laver, swirling between bare grey"
5821,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"banks, were as icy to the eye as the sharp gusts of hail from the"
5822,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"north-east were to the fingers.  I cast mechanically till I grew weary,"
5823,--PERSIAN PROVERB,and then with an empty creel and a villainous temper set myself to
5824,--PERSIAN PROVERB,trudge the two miles of bent to the inn.  Some distant ridges of hill
5825,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"stood out snow-clad against the dun sky, and half in anger, half in"
5826,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"dismal satisfaction, I told myself that fishing to-morrow would be as"

5828,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
5829,--PERSIAN PROVERB,At the inn door a tall man was stamping his feet and watching a servant
5830,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"lifting rodcases from a dog-cart.  Hooded and wrapped though he was, my"

5832,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"long, haggard, brown face, with the skin drawn tightly over the"
5833,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"cheek-bones, the keen blue eyes finely wrinkled round the corners with"
5834,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"staring at many suns, the scar which gave his mouth a humorous droop to"
5835,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"the right, made up a whole which was not easily forgotten.  I had last"
5836,--PERSIAN PROVERB,seen him on the quay at Funchal bargaining with some rascally boatman
5837,--PERSIAN PROVERB,to take him after mythical wild goats in Las Desertas.  Before that we
5838,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"had met at an embassy ball in Vienna, and still earlier at a"
5839,--PERSIAN PROVERB,hill-station in Persia to which I had been sent post-haste by an
5840,--PERSIAN PROVERB,anxious and embarrassed Government.  Also I had been at school with
5841,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"him, in those far-away days when we rode nine stone and dreamed of"
5842,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"cricket averages.  He was a soldier of note, who had taken part in two"
5843,--PERSIAN PROVERB,little wars and one big one; had himself conducted a political mission
5844,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"through a hard country with some success, and was habitually chosen by"
5845,--PERSIAN PROVERB,his superiors to keep his eyes open as a foreign attache in our
5846,--PERSIAN PROVERB,neighbours' wars.  But his fame as a hunter had gone abroad into places
5847,--PERSIAN PROVERB,where even the name of the British army is unknown.  He was the
5848,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"hungriest shikari I have ever seen, and I have seen many.  If you are"
5849,--PERSIAN PROVERB,wise you will go forthwith to some library and procure a little book
5850,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"entitled ""Three Hunting Expeditions,"" by A.W.T.  It is a modest work,"

5854,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"The sitting-room at the inn is a place of comfort, and while Thirlstone"
5855,--PERSIAN PROVERB,warmed his long back at the fire I sank contentedly into one of the

5858,--PERSIAN PROVERB,seemed an hour ago than a joke to be laughed at.  The landlord came in

5911,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
5912,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"Thirlstone's face showed profound relief.  ""Thank God!"" I heard him"
5913,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"mutter under his breath, and when the landlord had gone he fell to"
5914,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"talking of salmon with enthusiasm.  ""We must make a big day of it"

5918,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
5919,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"Dinner over, we drew our chairs to the hearth, and fell to talk and the"

5921,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"meet by a winter fire, their thoughts are certain to drift overseas."
5922,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"We spoke of the racing tides off Vancouver, and the lonely pine-clad"
5923,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"ridges running up to the snow-peaks of the Selkirks, to which we had"
5924,--PERSIAN PROVERB,both travelled once upon a time in search of sport.  Thirlstone on his
5925,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"own account had gone wandering to Alaska, and brought back some"
5926,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"bear-skins and a frost-bitten toe as trophies, and from his tales had"
5927,--PERSIAN PROVERB,consorted with the finest band of rogues which survives unhanged on
5928,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"this planet.  Then some casual word took our thoughts to the south, and"
5929,--PERSIAN PROVERB,our memories dallied with Africa.  Thirlstone had hunted in Somaliland
5930,--PERSIAN PROVERB,and done mighty slaughter; while I had spent some never-to-be forgotten
5931,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"weeks long ago in the hinterland of Zanzibar, in the days before"
5932,--PERSIAN PROVERB,railways and game-preserves.  I have gone through life with a keen eye
5933,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"for the discovery of earthly paradises, to which I intend to retire"
5934,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"when my work is over, and the fairest I thought I had found above the"
5935,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"Rift valley, where you had a hundred miles of blue horizon and the"
5936,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"weather of Scotland.  Thirlstone, not having been there, naturally"
5937,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"differed, and urged the claim of a certain glen in Kashmir, where you"
5938,--PERSIAN PROVERB,may hunt two varieties of bear and three of buck in thickets of
5939,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"rhododendron, and see the mightiest mountain-wall on earth from your"
5940,--PERSIAN PROVERB,tent door.  The mention of the Indian frontier brought us back to our
5941,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"professions, and for a little we talked ""shop"" with the unblushing"
5942,--PERSIAN PROVERB,confidence of those who know each other's work and approve it.  As a
5943,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"very young soldier Thirlstone had gone shooting in the Pamirs, and had"
5944,--PERSIAN PROVERB,blundered into a Russian party of exploration which contained
5945,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"Kuropatkin.  He had in consequence grossly outstayed his leave, having"
5946,--PERSIAN PROVERB,been detained for a fortnight by an arbitrary hospitality; but he had
5947,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"learned many things, and the experience had given him strong views on"
5948,--PERSIAN PROVERB,frontier questions.  Half an hour was devoted to a masterly survey of
5949,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"the East, until a word pulled us up."
5950,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
5951,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""I went there in '99"" Thirlstone was saying,--""the time Wiston and I"
5952,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"were sent--"" and then he stopped, and his eager face clouded.  Wiston's"

5956,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
5957,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""Pretty bad! He seemed a commonplace, good sort of fellow, popular,"
5958,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"fairly competent, a little bad-tempered perhaps.  And then suddenly he"
5959,--PERSIAN PROVERB,did something so extremely blackguardly that everything was at an end.
5960,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"It's no good repeating details, and I hate to think about it.  We know"
5961,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"little about our neighbours, and I'm not so sure that we know much"

5963,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"one of us, only most people are fortunate enough to go through the"
5964,--PERSIAN PROVERB,world without meeting anything to wake the devil in them.  I don't
5965,--PERSIAN PROVERB,believe Wiston was bad in the ordinary sense.  Only there was something
5966,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"else in him--somebody else, if you like--and in a moment it came"
5967,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"uppermost, and he was a branded man.  Ugh! it's a gruesome thought."""
5968,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"Thirlstone had let his pipe go out, and was staring moodily into the"

5973,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"our conscience, as if every man's nature were a smooth, round, white"
5974,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"thing, like a chuckie-stone.  But I believe there are two men--perhaps"
5975,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"more-in every one of us.  There's our ordinary self, generally rather"
5976,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"humdrum; and then there's a bit of something else, good, bad, but never"
5977,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"indifferent,--and it is that something else which may make a man a"
5978,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"saint or a great villain."""
5979,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
5980,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""'The Kings of Orion have come to earth,'""  I quoted."
5981,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
5982,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"Something in the words struck Thirlstone, and he asked me what was the"
5983,--PERSIAN PROVERB,yarn I spoke of.
5984,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
5985,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""It's an old legend,""  I explained.  ""When the kings were driven out of"
5986,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"Orion, they were sent to this planet and given each his habitation in"
5987,--PERSIAN PROVERB,some mortal soul.  There were differences of character in that royal
5988,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"family, and so the alter ego which dwells alongside of us may be"
5989,--PERSIAN PROVERB,virtuous or very much the reverse.  But the point is that he is always
5990,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"greater than ourselves, for he has been a king.  It's a foolish story,"
5991,--PERSIAN PROVERB,but very widely believed.  There is something of the sort in Celtic
5992,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"folk-lore, and there's a reference to it in Ausonius.  Also the bandits"
5993,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"in the Bakhtiari have a version of it in a very excellent ballad."""
5994,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
5995,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""Kings of Orion,"" said Thirlstone musingly.  ""I like that idea.  Good"
5996,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"or bad, but always great! After all, we show a kind of belief in it in"
5997,--PERSIAN PROVERB,our daily practice.  Every man is always making fancies about himself;
5998,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"but it is never his workaday self, but something else.  The bank clerk"
5999,--PERSIAN PROVERB,who pictures himself as a financial Napoleon knows that his own thin
6000,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"little soul is incapable of it; but he knows, too, that it is possible"
6001,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"enough for that other bigger thing which is not his soul, but yet in"
6002,--PERSIAN PROVERB,some odd way is bound up with it.  I fancy myself a field-marshal in a
6003,--PERSIAN PROVERB,European war; but I know perfectly well that if the job were offered
6004,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"me, I should realise my incompetence and decline.  I expect you rather"
6005,--PERSIAN PROVERB,picture yourself now and then as a sort of Julius Caesar and
6006,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"empire-maker, and yet, with all respect, my dear chap, I think it would"
6007,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"be rather too much for you."""

6009,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""There was once a man,""  I said, ""an early Victorian Whig, whose chief"

6026,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"myself.  I don't mind telling you the story, now that he is retired and"
6027,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"vegetating in his ancestral pastures.  Besides, the facts are all in"
6028,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"his favour, and the explanation is our own business...."
6029,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6030,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""His wife was my cousin, and when she died Tommy was left a very"
6031,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"withered, disconsolate man, with no particular object in life.  We all"
6032,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"thought he would give up the service, for he was hideously well off and"
6033,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"then one fine day, to our amazement, he was offered Deira, and accepted"
6034,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"it.  I was short of a job at the time, for my battalion was at home,"
6035,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"and there was nothing going on anywhere, so I thought I should like to"
6036,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"see what the East Coast of Africa was like, and wrote to Tommy about"
6037,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"it.  He jumped at me, cabled offering me what he called his Military"
6038,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"Secretaryship, and I got seconded, and set off.  I had never known him"
6039,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"very well, but what I had seen I had liked; and I suppose he was glad"
6040,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"to have one of Maggie's family with him, for he was still very low"
6041,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"about her loss.  I was in pretty good spirits, for it meant new"
6042,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"experiences, and I had hopes of big game."
6043,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6044,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""You've never been to Deira?  Well, there's no good trying to describe"
6045,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"it, for it's the only place in the world like itself.  God made it and"
6046,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"left it to its own devices.  The town is pretty enough, with its palms"
6047,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"and green headland, and little scrubby islands in the river's mouth."
6048,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"It has the usual half-Arab, half-Portugee look-white green-shuttered"
6049,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"houses, flat roofs, sallow little men in duck, and every type of nigger"
6050,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"from the Somali to the Shangaan.  There are some good buildings, and"
6051,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"Government House was the mansion of some old Portugee seigneur, and was"
6052,--PERSIAN PROVERB,built when people in Africa were not in such a hurry as to-day.  Inland
6053,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"there's a rolling, forest country, beginning with decent trees and"
6054,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"ending in mimosa-thorn, when the land begins to rise to the stony hills"
6055,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"of the interior; and that poisonous yellow river rolls through it all,"
6056,--PERSIAN PROVERB,with a denser native population along its banks than you will find
6057,--PERSIAN PROVERB,anywhere else north of the Zambesi.  For about two months in the year
6058,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"the climate is Paradise, and for the rest you live in a Turkish bath,"
6059,--PERSIAN PROVERB,with every known kind of fever hanging about.  We cleaned out the town
6060,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"and improved the sanitation, so there were few epidemics, but there was"
6061,--PERSIAN PROVERB,enough ordinary malaria to sicken a crocodile.
6062,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6063,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""The place was no special use to us.  It had been annexed in spite of a"
6064,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"tremendous Radical outcry, and, upon my soul, it was one of the few"
6065,--PERSIAN PROVERB,cases where the Radicals had something to say for themselves.  All we
6066,--PERSIAN PROVERB,got by it was half a dozen of the nastiest problems an unfortunate
6067,--PERSIAN PROVERB,governor can have to face.  Ten years before it had been a decaying
6068,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"strip of coast, with a few trading firms in the town, and a small"
6069,--PERSIAN PROVERB,export of ivory and timber.  But some years before Tommy took it up
6070,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"there had been a huge discovery of copper in the hills inland, a"
6071,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"railway had been built, and there were several biggish mining"
6072,--PERSIAN PROVERB,settlements at the end of it.  Deira itself was filled with offices of
6073,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"European firms, it had got a Stock Exchange of its own, and it was"
6074,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"becoming the usual cosmopolitan playground.  It had a knack, too, of"
6075,--PERSIAN PROVERB,getting the very worst breed of adventurer.  I know something of your
6076,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"South African and Australian mining town, and with all their faults"
6077,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"they are run by white men.  If they haven't much morals, they have a"
6078,--PERSIAN PROVERB,kind of decency which keeps them fairly straight.  But for our sins we
6079,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"got a brand of Levantine Jew, who was fit for nothing but making money"
6080,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"and making trouble.  They were always defying the law, and then, when"
6081,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"they got into a hole, they squealed to Government for help, and started"
6082,--PERSIAN PROVERB,a racket in the home papers about the weakness of the Imperial power.
6083,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"The crux of the whole difficulty was the natives, who lived along the"
6084,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"river and in the foothills.  They were a hardy race of Kaffirs, sort of"
6085,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"far-away cousins to the Zulu, and till the mines were opened they had"
6086,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"behaved well enough.  They had arms, which we had never dared to take"
6087,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"away, but they kept quiet and paid their hut-taxes like men.  I got to"
6088,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"know many of the chiefs, and liked them, for they were upstanding"
6089,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"fellows to look at and heavenborn shikaris.  However, when the Jews"
6090,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"came along they wanted labour, and, since we did not see our way to"
6091,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"allow them to add to the imported coolie population, they had to fall"
6092,--PERSIAN PROVERB,back upon the Labonga.  At first things went smoothly.  The chiefs were
6093,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"willing to let their men work for good wages, and for a time there was"
6094,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"enough labour for everybody.  But as the mines extended, and the"
6095,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"natives, after making a few pounds, wanted to get back to their kraals,"
6096,--PERSIAN PROVERB,there came a shortage; and since the work could not be allowed to
6097,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"slacken, the owners tried other methods.  They made promises which they"
6098,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"never intended to keep, and they stood on the letter of a law which the"
6099,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"natives did not understand, and they employed touts who were little"
6100,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"better than slave-dealers.  They got the labour, of course, but soon"
6101,--PERSIAN PROVERB,they had put the Labonga into a state of unrest which  a very little
6102,--PERSIAN PROVERB,would turn into a rising.
6103,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6104,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""Into this kettle of fish Tommy was pitchforked, and when I arrived he"
6105,--PERSIAN PROVERB,was just beginning to understand how unpleasant it was.  As I said
6106,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"before, I did not know him very well, and I was amazed to find how bad"
6107,--PERSIAN PROVERB,he was at his job.  A more curiously incompetent person I never met.
6108,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"He was a long, thin man, with a grizzled moustache and a mild sleepy"
6109,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"eye-not an impressive figure, except on a horse; and he had an odd lisp"
6110,--PERSIAN PROVERB,which made even a shrewd remark sound foolish.  He was the most
6111,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"industrious creature in the world, and a model of official decorum."
6112,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"His papers were always in order, his despatches always neat and"
6113,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"correct, and I don't believe any one ever caught him tripping in office"
6114,--PERSIAN PROVERB,work.  But he had no more conception than a child of the kind of
6115,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"trouble that was brewing.  He knew never an honest man from a rogue,"
6116,--PERSIAN PROVERB,and the result was that he received all unofficial communications with
6117,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"a polite disbelief.  I used to force him to see people--miners,"
6118,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"prospectors, traders, any one who had something to say worth listening"
6119,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"to, but it all glided smoothly off his mind.  He was simply the most"
6120,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"incompetent being ever created, living in the world as not being of it,"
6121,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"or rather creating a little official world of his own, where all events"
6122,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"happened on lines laid down by the Colonial Office, and men were like"
6123,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"papers, to be rolled into packets and properly docketed.  He had an"
6124,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"Executive Council of people like himself, competent officials and blind"
6125,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"bats at anything else.  Then there was a precious Legislative Council,"
6126,--PERSIAN PROVERB,intended to represent the different classes of the population.  There
6127,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"were several good men on it--one old trader called Mackay, for instance,"
6128,--PERSIAN PROVERB,who had been thirty years in the country-but most were nominees of the
6129,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"mining firms, and very seedy rascals at that.  They were always talking"
6130,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"about the rights of the white man, and demanding popular control of the"
6131,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"Government, and similar twaddle.  The leader was a man who hailed from"
6132,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"Hamburg, and called himself Le Foy--descended from a Crusader of the"
6133,--PERSIAN PROVERB,name of Levi--who was a jackal of one of the chief copper firms.  He
6134,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"overflowed with Imperialist sentiment, and when he wasn't waving the"
6135,--PERSIAN PROVERB,flag he used to gush about the beauties of English country life the
6136,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"grandeur of the English tradition.  He hated me from the start, for"
6137,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"when he talked of going 'home' I thought he meant Hamburg, and said so;"
6138,--PERSIAN PROVERB,and then a thing happened which made him hate me worse.  He was
6139,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"infernally rude to Tommy, who, like the dear sheep he was, never saw"
6140,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"it, and, if he had, wouldn't have minded.  But one day I chanced to"
6141,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"overhear some of his impertinences, so I hunted out my biggest sjambok"
6142,--PERSIAN PROVERB,and lay in wait for Mr. Le Foy.  I told him that he was a
6143,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"representative of the sovereign people, that I was a member of an"
6144,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"effete bureaucracy, and that it would be most painful if unpleasantness"
6145,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"arose between us.  But, I added, I was prepared, if necessary, to"
6146,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"sacrifice my official career to my private feelings, and if he dared to"
6147,--PERSIAN PROVERB,use such language again to his Majesty's representative I would give
6148,--PERSIAN PROVERB,him a hiding he would remember till he found himself in Abraham's
6149,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"bosom.  Not liking my sjambok, he became soap and butter at once, and"
6150,--PERSIAN PROVERB,held his tongue for a month or two.
6151,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6152,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""But though Tommy was no good at his job, he was a tremendous swell at"
6153,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"other things.  He was an uncommonly good linguist, and had always about"
6154,--PERSIAN PROVERB,a dozen hobbies which he slaved at; and when he found himself at Deira
6155,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"with a good deal of leisure, he became a bigger crank than ever.  He"
6156,--PERSIAN PROVERB,had a lot of books which used to follow him about the world in
6157,--PERSIAN PROVERB,zinc-lined boxes--your big paper-backed German books which mean
6158,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"research,--and he was a Fellow of the Royal Society, and corresponded"
6159,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"with half a dozen foreign shows.  India was his great subject, but he"
6160,--PERSIAN PROVERB,had been in the Sudan and knew a good deal about African races.  When I
6161,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"went out to him, his pet hobby was the Bantu, and he had acquired an"
6162,--PERSIAN PROVERB,amazing amount of miscellaneous learning.  He knew all about their
6163,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"immigration from the North, and the Arab and Phoenician trade-routes,"
6164,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"and the Portuguese occupation, and the rest of the history of that"
6165,--PERSIAN PROVERB,unpromising seaboard.  The way he behaved in his researches showed the
6166,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"man.  He worked hard at the Labonga language--which, I believe, is a"
6167,--PERSIAN PROVERB,linguistic curiosity of the first water-from missionary books and the
6168,--PERSIAN PROVERB,conversation of tame Kaffirs.  But he never thought of paying them a
6169,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"visit in their native haunts.  I was constantly begging him to do it,"
6170,--PERSIAN PROVERB,but it was not Tommy's way.  He did not care a straw about political
6171,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"experience, and he liked to look at things through the medium of paper"
6172,--PERSIAN PROVERB,and ink.  Then there were the Phoenician remains in the foot-hills
6173,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"where the copper was mined-old workings, and things which might have"
6174,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"been forts or temples.  He knew all that was to be known about them,"
6175,--PERSIAN PROVERB,but he had never seen them and never wanted to.  Once only he went to
6176,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"the hills, to open some new reservoirs and make the ordinary Governor's"
6177,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"speech; but he went in a special train and stayed two hours, most of"
6178,--PERSIAN PROVERB,which was spent in lunching and being played to by brass bands.
6179,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6180,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""But, oddly enough, there was one thing which stirred him with an"
6181,--PERSIAN PROVERB,interest that was not academic.  I discovered it by accident one day
6182,--PERSIAN PROVERB,when I went into his study and found him struggling with a map of
6183,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"Central Asia.  Instead of the mild, benevolent smile with which he"
6184,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"usually greeted my interruptions, he looked positively furtive, and, I"
6185,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"could have sworn, tried to shuffle the map under some papers.  Now it"
6186,--PERSIAN PROVERB,happens that Central Asia is the part of the globe that I know better
6187,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"than most men, and I could not help picking up the map and looking at"
6188,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"it.  It was a wretched thing, and had got the Oxus two hundred miles"
6189,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"out of its course.  I pointed this out to Tommy, and to my amazement he"
6190,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"became quite excited.  'Nonsense,' he said.  'You don't mean to say it"
6191,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"goes south of that desert.  Why, I meant to--,' and then he stammered"
6192,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"and stopped.  I wondered what on earth he had meant to do, but I merely"
6193,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"observed that I had been there, and knew.  That brought Tommy out of"
6194,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"his chair in real excitement.  'What!' he cried, 'you!  You never told"
6195,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"me,' and he started to fire off a round of questions, which showed that"
6196,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"if he knew very little about the place, he had it a good deal in his"
6197,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"mind."""
6198,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6199,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"I drew some sketch-plans for him, and left him brooding over them."
6200,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6201,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""That was the first hint I got.  The second was a few nights later,"
6202,--PERSIAN PROVERB,when we were smoking in the billiard-room.  I had been reading Marco
6203,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"Polo, and the talk got on to Persia and drifted all over the north side"
6204,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"of the Himalaya.  Tommy, with an abstracted eye, talked of Alexander"
6205,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"and Timour and Genghis Khan, and particularly of Prester John, who was"
6206,--PERSIAN PROVERB,a character and took his fancy.  I had told him that the natives in the
6207,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"Pamirs were true Persian stock, and this interested him greatly.  'Why"
6208,--PERSIAN PROVERB,was there never a great state built up in those valleys?' he asked.
6209,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"'You get nothing but a few wild conquerors rushing east and west, and"
6210,--PERSIAN PROVERB,then some squalid khanates.  And yet all the materials were there--the
6211,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"stuff for a strong race, a rich land, the traditions of an old"
6212,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"civilisation, and natural barriers against all invasion.'"
6213,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6214,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""'I suppose they never found the man,' I said."
6215,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6216,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""He agreed.  'Their princes were sots, or they were barbarians of"
6217,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"genius who could devastate to the gates of Peking or Constantinople,"
6218,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"but could never build.  They did not recognise their limits, and so"
6219,--PERSIAN PROVERB,they went out in a whirlwind.  But if there had been a man of solid
6220,--PERSIAN PROVERB,genius he might have built up the strongest nation on the globe.  In
6221,--PERSIAN PROVERB,time he could have annexed Persia and nibbled at China.  He would have
6222,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"been rich, for he could tap all the inland trade-routes of Asia.  He"
6223,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"would have had to be a conqueror, for his people would be a race of"
6224,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"warriors, but first and foremost he must have been a statesman.  Think"
6225,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"of such a civilisation, THE Asian civilisation, growing up mysteriously"
6226,--PERSIAN PROVERB,behind the deserts and the ranges!  That's my idea of Prester John.
6227,--PERSIAN PROVERB,Russia would have been confined to the line of the Urals.  China would
6228,--PERSIAN PROVERB,have been absorbed.  There would have been no Japan.  The whole history
6229,--PERSIAN PROVERB,of the world for the last few hundred years would have been different.
6230,--PERSIAN PROVERB,It is the greatest of all the lost chances in history.' Tommy waxed
6231,--PERSIAN PROVERB,pathetic over the loss.
6232,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6233,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""I was a little surprised at his eloquence, especially when he seemed"
6234,--PERSIAN PROVERB,to remember himself and stopped all of a sudden.  But for the next week
6235,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"I got no peace with his questions.  I told him all I knew of Bokhara,"
6236,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"and Samarkand, and Tashkend, and Yarkand.  I showed him the passes in"
6237,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"the Pamirs and the Hindu Kush.  I traced out the rivers, and I"
6238,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"calculated distances; we talked over imaginary campaigns, and set up"
6239,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"fanciful constitutions.  It a was childish game, but I found it"
6240,--PERSIAN PROVERB,interesting enough.  He spoke of it all with a curious personal tone
6241,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"which puzzled me, till one day when we were amusing ourselves with a"
6242,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"fight on the Zarafshan, and I put in a modest claim to be allowed to"
6243,--PERSIAN PROVERB,win once in a while.  For a second he looked at me in blank surprise.
6244,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"'You can't,' he said; 'I've got to enter Samarkand before I can...'"
6245,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"and he stopped again, with a glimmering sense in his face that he was"
6246,--PERSIAN PROVERB,giving himself away.  And then I knew that I had surprised Tommy's
6247,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"secret.  While he was muddling his own job, he was salving his pride"
6248,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"with fancies of some wild career in Asia, where Tommy, disguised as the"
6249,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"lord knows what Mussulman grandee, was hammering the little states into"
6250,--PERSIAN PROVERB,an empire.
6251,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6252,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""I did not think then as I think now, and I was amused to find so odd a"
6253,--PERSIAN PROVERB,trait in a dull man.  I had known something of the kind before.  I had
6254,--PERSIAN PROVERB,met fellows who after their tenth peg would begin to swagger about some
6255,--PERSIAN PROVERB,ridiculous fancy of their own--their little private corner of soul
6256,--PERSIAN PROVERB,showing for a moment when the drink had blown aside their common-sense.
6257,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"Now, I had never known the thing appear in cold blood and everyday"
6258,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"life, but I assumed the case to be the same.  I thought of it only as a"
6259,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"harmless fancy, never imagining that it had anything to do with"
6260,--PERSIAN PROVERB,character.  I put it down to that kindly imagination which is the old
6261,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"opiate for failures.  So I played up to Tommy with all my might, and"
6262,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"though he became very discreet after the first betrayal, having hit"
6263,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"upon the clue, I knew what to look for, and I found it.  When I told"
6264,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"him that the Labonga were in a devil of a mess, he would look at me"
6265,--PERSIAN PROVERB,with an empty face and change the subject; but once among the Turcomans
6266,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"his eye would kindle, and he would slave at his confounded folly with"
6267,--PERSIAN PROVERB,sufficient energy to reform the whole East Coast.  It was the spark
6268,--PERSIAN PROVERB,that kept the man alive.  Otherwise he would have been as limp as a
6269,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"rag, but this craziness put life into him, and made him carry his head"
6270,--PERSIAN PROVERB,in the air and walk like a free man.  I remember he was very keen about
6271,--PERSIAN PROVERB,any kind of martial poetry.  He used to go about crooning Scott and
6272,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"Macaulay to himself, and when we went for a walk or a ride he wouldn't"
6273,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"speak for miles, but keep smiling to himself and humming bits of songs."
6274,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"I daresay he was very happy,--far happier than your stolid, competent"
6275,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"man, who sees only the one thing to do and does it.  Tommy was muddling"
6276,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"his particular duty, but building glorious palaces in the air."
6277,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6278,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""One day Mackay, the old trader, came to me after a sitting of the"
6279,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"precious Legislative Council.  We were very friendly, and I had done"
6280,--PERSIAN PROVERB,all I could to get the Government to listen to his views.  He was a
6281,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"dour, ill-tempered Scotsman, very anxious for the safety of his"
6282,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"property, but perfectly careless about any danger to himself."
6283,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6284,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""'Captain Thirlstone,' he said, 'that Governor of yours is a damned"
6285,--PERSIAN PROVERB,fool.'
6286,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6287,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""Of course I shut him up very brusquely, but he paid no attention.  'He"
6288,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"just sits and grins, and lets yon Pentecostal crowd we've gotten here"
6289,--PERSIAN PROVERB,as a judgment for our sins do what they like wi' him.  God kens what'll
6290,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"happen.  I would go home to-morrow, if I could realise without an"
6291,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"immoderate loss.  For the day of reckoning is at hand.  Maark my words,"
6292,--PERSIAN PROVERB,Captain--at hand.'
6293,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6294,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""I said I agreed with him about the approach of trouble, but that the"
6295,--PERSIAN PROVERB,Governor would rise to the occasion.  I told him that people like Tommy
6296,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"were only seen at their best in a crisis, and that he might be"
6297,--PERSIAN PROVERB,perfectly confident that when it arrived he would get a new idea of the
6298,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"man.  I said this, but of course I did not believe a word of it.  I"
6299,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"thought Tommy was only a dreamer, who had rotted any grit he ever"
6300,--PERSIAN PROVERB,possessed by his mental opiates.  At that time I did not understand
6301,--PERSIAN PROVERB,about the kings from Orion.
6302,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6303,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""And then came the thing we had all been waiting for--a Labonga rising."
6304,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"A week before I had got leave and had gone up country, partly to shoot,"
6305,--PERSIAN PROVERB,but mainly to see for myself what trouble was brewing.  I kept away
6306,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"from the river, and therefore missed the main native centres, but such"
6307,--PERSIAN PROVERB,kraals as I passed had a look I did not like.  The chiefs were almost
6308,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"always invisible, and the young bloods were swaggering about and"
6309,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"bukking to each other, while the women were grinding maize as if for"
6310,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"some big festival.  However, after a bit the country seemed to grow"
6311,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"more normal, and I went into the foothills to shoot, fairly easy in my"
6312,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"mind.  I had got up to a place called Shimonwe, on the Pathi river,"
6313,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"where I had ordered letters to be sent, and one night coming in from a"
6314,--PERSIAN PROVERB,hard day after kudu I found a post-runner half-dead of fatigue with a
6315,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"chit from Utterson, who commanded a police district twenty miles nearer"
6316,--PERSIAN PROVERB,the coast.  It said simply that all the young men round about him had
6317,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"cleared out and appeared to be moving towards Deira, that he was in the"
6318,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"devil of a quandary, and that, since the police were under the"
6319,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"Governor, he would take his orders from me."
6320,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6321,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""It looked as if the heather were fairly on fire at last, so I set off"
6322,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"early next morning to trek back.  About midday I met Utterson, a very"
6323,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"badly scared little man, who had come to look for me.  It seemed that"
6324,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"his policemen had bolted in the night and gone to join the rising,"
6325,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"leaving him with two white sergeants, barely fifty rounds of"
6326,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"ammunition, and no neighbour for a hundred miles.  He said that the"
6327,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"Labonga chiefs were not marching to the coast, as he had thought, but"
6328,--PERSIAN PROVERB,north along the eastern foothills in the direction of the mines.  This
6329,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"was better news, for it meant that in all probability the railway would"
6330,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"remain open.  It was my business to get somehow to my chief, and I was"
6331,--PERSIAN PROVERB,in the deuce of a stew how to manage it.  It was no good following the
6332,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"line of the natives' march, for they would have been between me and my"
6333,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"goal, and the only way was to try and outflank them by going due east,"
6334,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"in the Deira direction, and then turning north, so as to strike the"
6335,--PERSIAN PROVERB,railway about half-way to the mines.  I told Utterson we had better
6336,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"scatter, otherwise we should have no chance of getting through a"
6337,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"densely populated native country.  So, about five in the afternoon I"
6338,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"set off with my chief shikari, who, by good luck, was not a Labonga,"
6339,--PERSIAN PROVERB,and dived into the jungly bush which skirts the hills.
6340,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6341,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""For three days I had a baddish time.  We steered by the stars,"
6342,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"travelling chiefly by night, and we showed extraordinary skill in"
6343,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"missing the water-holes.  I had a touch of fever and got light-headed,"
6344,--PERSIAN PROVERB,and it was all I could do to struggle through the thick grass and
6345,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"wait-a-bit thorns.  My clothes were torn to rags, and I grew so"
6346,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"footsore that it was agony to move.  All the same we travelled fast,"
6347,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"and there was no chance of our missing the road, for any route due"
6348,--PERSIAN PROVERB,north was bound to cut the railway.  I had the most sickening
6349,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"uncertainty about what was to come next.  Hely, who was in command at"
6350,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"Deira, was a good enough man, but he had only three companies of white"
6351,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"troops, and the black troops were as likely as not to be on their way"
6352,--PERSIAN PROVERB,to the rebels.  It looked as if we should have a Cawnpore business on a
6353,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"small scale, though I thanked Heaven there were no women in the case."
6354,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"As for Tommy, he would probably be repeating platitudes in Deira and"
6355,--PERSIAN PROVERB,composing an intelligent despatch on the whole subject.
6356,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6357,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""About four in the afternoon of the third day I struck the line near a"
6358,--PERSIAN PROVERB,little station called Palala.  I saw by the look of the rails that
6359,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"trains were still running, and my hopes revived.  At Palala there was a"
6360,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"coolie stationmaster, who gave me a drink and a little food, after"
6361,--PERSIAN PROVERB,which I slept heavily in his office till wakened by the arrival of an
6362,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"up train.  It contained one of the white companies and a man Davidson,"
6363,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"of the 101st, who was Hely's second in command.  From him I had news"
6364,--PERSIAN PROVERB,that took away my breath.  The Governor had gone up the line two days
6365,--PERSIAN PROVERB,before with an A.D.C.  and old Mackay.  'The sportsman has got a move
6366,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"on him at last,' said Davidson, 'but what he means to do Heaven only"
6367,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"knows.  The Labonga are at the mines, and a kind of mine-guard has been"
6368,--PERSIAN PROVERB,formed for defence.  The joke of it is that most of the magnates are
6369,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"treed up there, for the railway is cut and they can't get away.  I"
6370,--PERSIAN PROVERB,don't envy your chief the job of schooling that nervous crowd.'
6371,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6372,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""I went on with Davidson, and very early next morning we came to a"
6373,--PERSIAN PROVERB,broken culvert and had to stop.  There we stuck for three hours till
6374,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"the down train arrived, and with it Hely.  He was for ordinary a stolid"
6375,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"soul, but I never saw a man in such a fever of excitement.  He gripped"
6376,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"me by the arm and fairly shook me.  'That old man of yours is a hero,'"
6377,--PERSIAN PROVERB,he cried.  'The Lord forgive me!  and I have always crabbed him.'
6378,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6379,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""I implored him in Heaven's name to tell me what was up, but he would"
6380,--PERSIAN PROVERB,say nothing till he had had his pow-pow with Davidson.  It seemed that
6381,--PERSIAN PROVERB,he was bringing all his white troops up the line for some great
6382,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"demonstration that Tommy had conceived.  Davidson went back to Deira,"
6383,--PERSIAN PROVERB,while we mended the culvert and got the men transferred to the other
6384,--PERSIAN PROVERB,train.  Then I screwed the truth out of Hely.  Tommy had got up to the
6385,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"mines before the rebels arrived, and had found as fine a chaos as can"
6386,--PERSIAN PROVERB,be imagined.  He did not seem to have had any doubts what to do.  There
6387,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"was a certain number of white workmen, hard fellows from Cornwall"
6388,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"mostly, with a few Australians, and these he got together with Mackay's"
6389,--PERSIAN PROVERB,help and organised into a pretty useful corps.  He set them to guard
6390,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"the offices, and gave them strict orders to shoot at sight any one"
6391,--PERSIAN PROVERB,attempting to leave.  Then he collected the bosses and talked to them
6392,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"like a father.  What he said Hely did not know, except that he had"
6393,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"damned their eyes pretty heartily, and told them what a set of swine"
6394,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"they were, making trouble which they had not the pluck to face."
6395,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"Whether from Mackay, or from his own intelligence, or from a memory of"
6396,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"my neglected warnings, he seemed to have got a tight grip on the facts"
6397,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"at last.  Meanwhile, the Labonga were at the doors, chanting their"
6398,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"battle-songs half a mile away, and shots were heard from the far"
6399,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"pickets.  If they had tried to rush the place then, all would have been"
6400,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"over, but, luckily, that was never their way of fighting.  They sat"
6401,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"down in camp to make their sacrifices and consult their witch-doctors,"
6402,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"and presently Hely arrived with the first troops, having come in on the"
6403,--PERSIAN PROVERB,northern flank when he found the line cut.  He had been in time to hear
6404,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"the tail-end of Tommy's final address to the mineowners.  He told them,"
6405,--PERSIAN PROVERB,in words which Hely said he could never have imagined coming from his
6406,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"lips, that they would be well served if the Labonga cleaned the whole"
6407,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"place out.  Only, he said, that would be against the will of Britain,"
6408,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"and it was his business, as a loyal servant, to prevent it.  Then,"
6409,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"after giving Hely his instructions, he had put on his uniform, gold"
6410,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"lace and all, and every scrap of bunting he possessed--all the orders"
6411,--PERSIAN PROVERB,and 'Golden Stars' of half a dozen Oriental States where he had served.
6412,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"He made Ashurst, the A.D.C., put on his best Hussar's kit, and Mackay"
6413,--PERSIAN PROVERB,rigged himself out in a frock-coat and a topper; and the three set out
6414,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"on horseback for the Labonga.  'I believe he'll bring it off, said"
6415,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"Hely, with wild eyes, 'and, by Heaven, if he does, it'll be the best"
6416,--PERSIAN PROVERB,thing since John Nicholson!'
6417,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6418,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""For the rest of the way I sat hugging myself with excitement.  The"
6419,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"miracle of miracles seemed to have come.  The old, slack, incompetent"
6420,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"soul in Tommy seemed to have been driven out by that other spirit,"
6421,--PERSIAN PROVERB,which had hitherto been content to dream of crazy victories on the
6422,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"Oxus.  I cursed my folly in having missed it all, for I would have"
6423,--PERSIAN PROVERB,given my right hand to be with him among the Labonga.  I envied that
6424,--PERSIAN PROVERB,young fool Ashurst his luck in being present at that queer
6425,--PERSIAN PROVERB,transformation scene.  I had not a doubt that Tommy would bring it off
6426,--PERSIAN PROVERB,all right.  The kings from Orion don't go into action without coming
6427,--PERSIAN PROVERB,out on top.  As we got near the mines I kept my ears open for the sound
6428,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"of shots; but all was still,--not even the kind of hubbub a native"
6429,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"force makes when it is on the move.  Something had happened, but what"
6430,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"it was no man could guess. When we got to where the line was up, we"
6431,--PERSIAN PROVERB,made very good time over the five miles to the mines.  No one
6432,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"interfered with us, and the nearer we got the greater grew my"
6433,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"certainty.  Soon we were at the pickets, who had nothing to tell us;"
6434,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"and then we were racing up the long sandy street to the offices, and"
6435,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"there, sitting smoking on the doorstep of the hotel, surrounded by"
6436,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"everybody who was not on duty, were Mackay and Ashurst."
6437,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6438,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""They were an odd pair.  Ashurst still wore his uniform; but he seemed"
6439,--PERSIAN PROVERB,to have been rolling about in it on the ground; his sleek hair was
6440,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"wildly ruffled, and he was poking holes in the dust with his sword."
6441,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"Mackay had lost his topper, and wore a disreputable cap, his ancient"
6442,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"frock-coat was without buttons, and his tie had worked itself up behind"
6443,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"his ears.  They talked excitedly to each other, now and then"
6444,--PERSIAN PROVERB,vouchsafing a scrap of information to an equally excited audience.
6445,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"When they saw me they rose and rushed for me, and dragged me between"
6446,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"them up the street, while the crowd tailed at our heels."
6447,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6448,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""'Ye're a true prophet, Captain Thirlstone,' Mackay began, 'and I ask"
6449,--PERSIAN PROVERB,your pardon for doubting you.  Ye said the Governor only needed a
6450,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"crisis to behave like a man.  Well, the crisis has come; and if there's"
6451,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"a man alive in this sinful world, it's that chief o' yours.  And then"
6452,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"his emotion overcame him, and, hard-bitten devil as he was, he sat down"
6453,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"on the ground and gasped with hysterical laughter, while Ashurst, with"
6454,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"a very red face, kept putting the wrong end of a cigarette in his mouth"
6455,--PERSIAN PROVERB,and swearing profanely.
6456,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6457,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""I never remember a madder sight.  There was the brassy blue sky and"
6458,--PERSIAN PROVERB,reddish granite rock and acres of thick red dust.  The scrub had that
6459,--PERSIAN PROVERB,metallic greenness which you find in all copper places.  Pretty
6460,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"unwholesome it looked, and the crowd, which had got round us again, was"
6461,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"more unwholesome still.  Fat Jew boys, with diamond rings on dirty"
6462,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"fingers and greasy linen cuffs, kept staring at us with twitching lips;"
6463,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"and one or two smarter fellows in riding-breeches, mine-managers and"
6464,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"suchlike, tried to show their pluck by nervous jokes.  And in the"
6465,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"middle was Mackay, with his damaged frocker, drawling out his story in"
6466,--PERSIAN PROVERB,broad Scots.
6467,--PERSIAN PROVERB,
6468,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"""'He made this laddie put on his braws, and he commandeered this"
6469,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"iniquitous garment for me.  I've raxed its seams, and it'll never look"
6470,--PERSIAN PROVERB,again on the man that owns it.  Syne he arrayed himself in purple and
6471,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"fine linen till he as like the king's daughter, all glorious without;"
6472,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"and says he to me, ""Mackay,"" he says, ""we'll go and talk to these"
6473,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"uncovenanted deevils in their own tongue.  We'll visit them at home,"
6474,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"Mackay,"" he says. ""They're none such bad fellows, but they want a"
6475,--PERSIAN PROVERB,"little humouring from men like you and me.""  So we got on our horses"

6548,--PERSIAN PROVERB,it was his desire that such young men as could be spared should have a
