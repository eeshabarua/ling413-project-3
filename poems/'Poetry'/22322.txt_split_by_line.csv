106,FANTASIES.,
107,FANTASIES.,
108,FANTASIES.,In the flowery land of Persia
109,FANTASIES.,"Long ago, as poets tell,"
110,FANTASIES.,Where three rivers met together
111,FANTASIES.,Did a happy people dwell.
112,FANTASIES.,Never did these happy people
113,FANTASIES.,"Suffer sickness, plague, or dearth,"
114,FANTASIES.,Living in a golden climate
115,FANTASIES.,"In the fairest place on earth,"
116,FANTASIES.,Living thus thro' endless summers
117,FANTASIES.,"And half-summers hardly colder,"
118,FANTASIES.,"Growing, tho' they hardly guessed it,"
119,FANTASIES.,Very gradually older.
120,FANTASIES.,
121,FANTASIES.,I can very well imagine
122,FANTASIES.,These old Persian lords and ladies
123,FANTASIES.,"Sitting in their pleasant gardens,"
124,FANTASIES.,"Dreaming, dozing, where the shade is;"
125,FANTASIES.,"Almond trees a mass of blossom,"
126,FANTASIES.,"Roses, roses, red as wine,"
127,FANTASIES.,With the helmets of the tulips
128,FANTASIES.,"Flaming in a martial line,"
129,FANTASIES.,"While beside a marble basin,"
130,FANTASIES.,"With a fountain gushing forth,"
131,FANTASIES.,"Stands a red-legged crane, alighted"
132,FANTASIES.,From the deserts of the North.
133,FANTASIES.,
134,FANTASIES.,"So they lived these ancient people,"
135,FANTASIES.,"With the happy harmless faces,"
136,FANTASIES.,Dreaming till the purple twilight
137,FANTASIES.,"In their flowery garden-places,"
138,FANTASIES.,Finding every year the sunshine
139,FANTASIES.,"And the wind a little colder,"
140,FANTASIES.,"Growing, tho' they hardly guessed it,"
141,FANTASIES.,"Very gradually older,"
142,FANTASIES.,Till at last they grew so frail
143,FANTASIES.,"That to their gardens they were carried,"
144,FANTASIES.,"Very feeble and exhausted,"
145,FANTASIES.,"Weak as babes--But still they tarried,"
146,FANTASIES.,
147,FANTASIES.,Lying till the purple twilight
148,FANTASIES.,"Wrapped in wool but hardly warm,"
149,FANTASIES.,Wearing shawls of costliest texture
150,FANTASIES.,"Lest the wind might do them harm,"
151,FANTASIES.,Feeling very faint sensations
152,FANTASIES.,"Of delight in each old breast,"
153,FANTASIES.,Twittering with tiny voices
154,FANTASIES.,Like young swallows in a nest.
155,FANTASIES.,Then the young men spoke together
156,FANTASIES.,"As they feasted in the taverns,"
157,FANTASIES.,"""It is time to take our Fathers,"
158,FANTASIES.,"We must bear them to the Caverns."""
159,FANTASIES.,
160,FANTASIES.,"In a mountain were the Caverns,"
161,FANTASIES.,"Fourteen leagues across the sand,"
162,FANTASIES.,Fourteen leagues across the desert
163,FANTASIES.,In a naked golden land.
164,FANTASIES.,Black and bold and bare the mountain
165,FANTASIES.,"Modelled into many shapes,"
166,FANTASIES.,"Cones and pyramids and pillars,"
167,FANTASIES.,Beetling cliffs and jutting capes.
168,FANTASIES.,And within it were the Caverns
169,FANTASIES.,"Tunnelled into every part,"
170,FANTASIES.,"Some by ancient Persian devils,"
171,FANTASIES.,Others by a modern art.
172,FANTASIES.,
173,FANTASIES.,"Where the terraced lawns lay dreaming,"
174,FANTASIES.,Underneath a cedar-tree
175,FANTASIES.,"Dozed an ancient, ancient person"
176,FANTASIES.,Tiny as a child of three.
177,FANTASIES.,Every day a gobbling negro
178,FANTASIES.,To his place the old man carried;
179,FANTASIES.,Very feeble and exhausted
180,FANTASIES.,Did he seem--but still he tarried.
181,FANTASIES.,"Then Hasan, the young lord, murmured,"
182,FANTASIES.,"As he feasted in the taverns,"
183,FANTASIES.,"""It is time to take my Father,"
184,FANTASIES.,"I must bear him to the Caverns."""
185,FANTASIES.,
186,FANTASIES.,"So he took his long-maned pony,"
187,FANTASIES.,"Her who wore the silver shoes,"
188,FANTASIES.,Galloped thro' the crowded highways
189,FANTASIES.,Like one with no time to lose.
190,FANTASIES.,Purpose in his warning outcry
191,FANTASIES.,(Was he not the next of kin?)
192,FANTASIES.,"Till he reached his palace gateway,"
193,FANTASIES.,"Flung the rein and fled within,"
194,FANTASIES.,Chose with care a wicker basket
195,FANTASIES.,"Very strong and deep and wide,"
196,FANTASIES.,Laying shawls of costliest texture
197,FANTASIES.,And an eider quilt inside.
198,FANTASIES.,
199,FANTASIES.,"Underneath the spreading cedar,"
200,FANTASIES.,"In an arbour newly built,"
201,FANTASIES.,"Found Hasan his ancient person,"
202,FANTASIES.,"Put him underneath the quilt,"
203,FANTASIES.,Mounted then his long-maned pony
204,FANTASIES.,"With the basket on his arm,"
205,FANTASIES.,Carrying it very firmly
206,FANTASIES.,Lest his father might take harm.
207,FANTASIES.,"Galloped thro' the crowded highway,"
208,FANTASIES.,"Passing by the Street of Taverns,"
209,FANTASIES.,Fourteen leagues across the desert
210,FANTASIES.,Till he came unto the Caverns.
211,FANTASIES.,
212,FANTASIES.,Fastened then his long-maned pony
213,FANTASIES.,To a ring-post at the mouth
214,FANTASIES.,(Scores and scores of ring-posts were there
215,FANTASIES.,Where the Caverns faced the South)
216,FANTASIES.,Plunged within the long wide gallery
217,FANTASIES.,"Tunnelled 'neath the rocky roof,"
218,FANTASIES.,With a lantern light exploring
219,FANTASIES.,"All the dark which lay aloof,"
220,FANTASIES.,"Treading swiftly, treading surely,"
221,FANTASIES.,"With the basket on his arm,"
222,FANTASIES.,Carrying it very firmly
223,FANTASIES.,Lest his father might take harm.
224,FANTASIES.,
225,FANTASIES.,Till he came a byway unto
226,FANTASIES.,"Fashioned from another way,"
227,FANTASIES.,And a niche seen at the summit
228,FANTASIES.,Of a guiding lantern ray.
229,FANTASIES.,"Lifted then the basket gently,"
230,FANTASIES.,"Poised, and placed it in the niche,"
231,FANTASIES.,"Saying ""Farewell, ancient father,"
232,FANTASIES.,"'Tis the custom"" ... after which"
233,FANTASIES.,Bowed his head before his father
234,FANTASIES.,"Thrice, and swiftly turned to go,"
235,FANTASIES.,"Knowing that it was the custom,"
236,FANTASIES.,Thinking it was better so.
237,FANTASIES.,
238,FANTASIES.,"Suddenly he heard a droning,"
239,FANTASIES.,"Like a gnat's small plaintive lay,"
240,FANTASIES.,Somewhere in the dark behind him
241,FANTASIES.,"Where the ""Ancient Persons"" lay,"
242,FANTASIES.,Heard a little ghostly twitter
243,FANTASIES.,"Like a voice addressing him,"
244,FANTASIES.,Turned and saw his father staring
245,FANTASIES.,"Just above the basket rim,"
246,FANTASIES.,"Staring at Hasan, his strong son,"
247,FANTASIES.,"With his filmy red-rimmed eyes,"
248,FANTASIES.,"""What's ado, Oh! ancient father?"""
249,FANTASIES.,Cried Hasan in great surprise.
250,FANTASIES.,
251,FANTASIES.,"""Son,"" replied the ancient person,"
252,FANTASIES.,"""Tho' a miser is disgraced,"
253,FANTASIES.,Even in a wealthy household
254,FANTASIES.,"Monstrous is the crime of waste,"
255,FANTASIES.,Strong and shapely is the basket
256,FANTASIES.,Much hath held and more will take;
257,FANTASIES.,If you leave it in the Caverns
258,FANTASIES.,Won't it be a great mistake?
259,FANTASIES.,"So, for once, let custom perish...."
260,FANTASIES.,"Son, 'tis I, your father, ask it,"
261,FANTASIES.,Lift me out and lay me gently
262,FANTASIES.,"On the rock and ... take our basket."""
263,FANTASIES.,
264,FANTASIES.,Oh! the young lord's wild amazement
265,FANTASIES.,As he heard that tiny hum;
266,FANTASIES.,Turned the lantern light behind him
267,FANTASIES.,Stricken with amazement dumb.
268,FANTASIES.,Oh! the young lord's vast confusion
269,FANTASIES.,As its meaning gave a flicker--
270,FANTASIES.,Oh! the mild iconoclastic
271,FANTASIES.,Staring o'er the edge of wicker.
272,FANTASIES.,Staring--staring--simply staring
273,FANTASIES.,With his filmy red-rimmed eyes--
274,FANTASIES.,Down Hasan his father lifted
275,FANTASIES.,Silent still in strange surmise.
276,FANTASIES.,
277,FANTASIES.,Never faster had prince ridden
278,FANTASIES.,"From the place of Persian devils,"
279,FANTASIES.,Where its huge and inky bastions
280,FANTASIES.,Frowned across the golden levels;
281,FANTASIES.,Nor before had faster travelled
282,FANTASIES.,Scion of the equine brood
283,FANTASIES.,"Than that day, that day of portent,"
284,FANTASIES.,Galloped she the silver-shoed.
285,FANTASIES.,Saw Hasan the meaning clearly
286,FANTASIES.,And a prophet (so they said)
287,FANTASIES.,After sunset thro' the taverns
288,FANTASIES.,Loud proclaimed the custom dead.
289,FANTASIES.,
290,FANTASIES.,This a legend of old Persia
291,FANTASIES.,Of an earlier happier day

302,FANTASIES.,"Where have you been,"
303,FANTASIES.,"In the lane, the green lane, or the heather,"
304,FANTASIES.,"My little queen?"""
305,FANTASIES.,
306,FANTASIES.,"""Honey mother, sweet little mother,"
307,FANTASIES.,"Oh! my old grey mummy,"
308,FANTASIES.,It's the blood of berries on my skirt
309,FANTASIES.,"Makes me look rummy."""
310,FANTASIES.,
311,FANTASIES.,"""There is no juice on your coral lips,"
312,FANTASIES.,"Your amber eyes are wild,"
313,FANTASIES.,"And why do you dance like an angry jay,"
314,FANTASIES.,"My fairy child?"""
315,FANTASIES.,
316,FANTASIES.,"""I can tell, I can tell,"
317,FANTASIES.,"Oh! my delicate mam,"
318,FANTASIES.,"I dance to the tune of a blue-bell,"
319,FANTASIES.,"Which told me what I am."""
320,FANTASIES.,
321,FANTASIES.,"""Gilda, Gilda, my lovely child,"
322,FANTASIES.,"Say how it spoke,"
323,FANTASIES.,There is nothing well in a flower's spell
324,FANTASIES.,"On one of our folk."""
325,FANTASIES.,
326,FANTASIES.,"""Oh! my pet, my beautiful heart,"
327,FANTASIES.,"Oh! my cunning mummy,"
328,FANTASIES.,"My cousin the sun and the wind have begun,"
329,FANTASIES.,"That's why I look rummy."""
330,FANTASIES.,
331,FANTASIES.,"""I have known one since I have begun,"
332,FANTASIES.,"I have known a dozen,"
333,FANTASIES.,But never I knew a girl was true
334,FANTASIES.,"Who called _them_ cousin."""
335,FANTASIES.,
336,FANTASIES.,"""Oh! my mam, my delicate mam,"
337,FANTASIES.,"Do not scold your daughter,"
338,FANTASIES.,I only went to the Witch's pool
339,FANTASIES.,"And looked in the water."""
340,FANTASIES.,
341,FANTASIES.,"""Oh! my dove, my beautiful elf,"
342,FANTASIES.,"Was the water clear as heaven,"
343,FANTASIES.,"Did you weave a crown of flowers for yourself,"
344,FANTASIES.,"In the magic of even?"""
345,FANTASIES.,
346,FANTASIES.,"""Oh! my mother, my honey mother,"
347,FANTASIES.,"The water was heaven-clear,"
348,FANTASIES.,I wove a crown of marigolds....
349,FANTASIES.,"But why do you look so queer?"""
350,FANTASIES.,
351,FANTASIES.,"""Oh! my girl, my pitiful girl,"
352,FANTASIES.,"Good-bye to your happy hours,"
353,FANTASIES.,The Curse of the Pool is on you....
354,FANTASIES.,"Your ways are not ours."""

358,FANTASIES.,
359,FANTASIES.,The Roof of the World.
360,FANTASIES.,
361,FANTASIES.,
362,FANTASIES.,"""Ere the first blush of morning's rose"
363,FANTASIES.,"Had reddened the eternal snows,"
364,FANTASIES.,"I plunged the pines among,"
365,FANTASIES.,And came down thro' the forest sons
366,FANTASIES.,In their deep-ranked battalions
367,FANTASIES.,With practised steps and strong.
368,FANTASIES.,
369,FANTASIES.,"""Then heard I from the plateau rock"
370,FANTASIES.,A lowing cow and a crowing cock--
371,FANTASIES.,Thin sounds in upper air.
372,FANTASIES.,And far below at the valley's end
373,FANTASIES.,I saw the morning smoke ascend
374,FANTASIES.,That showed me men were there.
375,FANTASIES.,
376,FANTASIES.,"""Ho! you lads, arouse, arouse!"
377,FANTASIES.,He is descended to your house
378,FANTASIES.,Of whom wild legend ran.
379,FANTASIES.,"On the roof of the world I dwelt five year,"
380,FANTASIES.,"Go, tell your master I am here"
381,FANTASIES.,To be his serving-man.
382,FANTASIES.,
383,FANTASIES.,"""Ho! all you folk, I climbed above"
384,FANTASIES.,The boundaries of hate and love.
385,FANTASIES.,Ho! such an one was I--
386,FANTASIES.,The wind it whistled to my bone.
387,FANTASIES.,"I was alone, alone, alone"
388,FANTASIES.,With the mountains and the sky.
389,FANTASIES.,
390,FANTASIES.,"""It is a timeless land and still;"
391,FANTASIES.,The heavens slowly like a wheel
392,FANTASIES.,Revolve themselves around;
393,FANTASIES.,There are two rulers in that place;
394,FANTASIES.,Eternity sits throned by space;
395,FANTASIES.,Their law is without sound.
396,FANTASIES.,
397,FANTASIES.,"""Ho! you folk, such feats I did"
398,FANTASIES.,"On the world's roof the snow amid,"
399,FANTASIES.,Ho! such an one as I--
400,FANTASIES.,"I matched the wild goat in my race,"
401,FANTASIES.,And underneath the long wise face
402,FANTASIES.,I pulled the beard awry.
403,FANTASIES.,
404,FANTASIES.,"""Five years I sported undismayed,"
405,FANTASIES.,"But suddenly I was afraid,"
406,FANTASIES.,"Yea, fearfully amazed."
407,FANTASIES.,I saw the eye of a dying hare;
408,FANTASIES.,Infinity was mirrored there
409,FANTASIES.,Ere it was wholly glazed.
410,FANTASIES.,
411,FANTASIES.,"""And this shall be my daily good,"
412,FANTASIES.,"To draw your water, hew your wood,"
413,FANTASIES.,And lighten all your need;
414,FANTASIES.,To do your sowing and your tilling;
415,FANTASIES.,"But to be bright and always willing,"
416,FANTASIES.,"And have no other creed."""
417,FANTASIES.,
418,FANTASIES.,All bronzed and bearded was his face;
419,FANTASIES.,He had a rapture and a grace
420,FANTASIES.,From living in the wild;
421,FANTASIES.,As he stared around and strangely spoke
422,FANTASIES.,"He lookèd not like other folk,"
423,FANTASIES.,But as an eager child.
424,FANTASIES.,
425,FANTASIES.,
426,FANTASIES.,
427,FANTASIES.,
428,FANTASIES.,The Poet and the Lily.
429,FANTASIES.,
430,FANTASIES.,
431,FANTASIES.,"A poet was born in a modern time,"
432,FANTASIES.,"'Neath Saturn and his Rings,"
433,FANTASIES.,"He was a child of the world's prime,"
434,FANTASIES.,Knew all beautiful things.
435,FANTASIES.,"He was a child of morning and mirth,"
436,FANTASIES.,"Laughing for joy of the sun,"
437,FANTASIES.,His nostrils drank the scent of earth
438,FANTASIES.,When rain is over and done.
439,FANTASIES.,
440,FANTASIES.,A lily came from the winter's womb
441,FANTASIES.,"And grew in its own sweet pride,"
442,FANTASIES.,"But the ruthless steel passed over its bloom,"
443,FANTASIES.,And low in the dust it died.
444,FANTASIES.,And the poet's heart was filled with pain
445,FANTASIES.,That a delicate thing and rare
446,FANTASIES.,Should be reft of the beauty of which it was fain
447,FANTASIES.,And killed by the cruel share.
448,FANTASIES.,
449,FANTASIES.,"So he sang of the meadows white with lambs,"
450,FANTASIES.,"And life all young again,"
451,FANTASIES.,"Of the colts which gallop to their dams,"
452,FANTASIES.,Knowing not any rein.
453,FANTASIES.,"He sang of the spring upon the sea,"
454,FANTASIES.,"Hedges all white with may,"
455,FANTASIES.,"The year in its sweet infancy,"
456,FANTASIES.,This our great world at play.
457,FANTASIES.,
458,FANTASIES.,Of shepherds piping to their flocks
459,FANTASIES.,"Across the fields of thyme,"
460,FANTASIES.,"Of sunlit fields above the rocks,"
461,FANTASIES.,Where the small waves lap in rhyme.
462,FANTASIES.,"Of glancing maids and youths their peers,"
463,FANTASIES.,"For ever young and free,"
464,FANTASIES.,"With faces fair, and in their ears"
465,FANTASIES.,Great music of the sea.
466,FANTASIES.,
467,FANTASIES.,He sang the amber moon a-sail
468,FANTASIES.,"In an even of misty blue,"
469,FANTASIES.,"The stars which burn, the stars which pale,"
470,FANTASIES.,The might which holds them true;
471,FANTASIES.,The comets in another sky
472,FANTASIES.,Which sweep to an unknown morn.
473,FANTASIES.,He sang of some vast agony
474,FANTASIES.,Or ever a world was born.
475,FANTASIES.,
476,FANTASIES.,"He sang a song like a twanging bow,"
477,FANTASIES.,His head was full of sound
478,FANTASIES.,As a dark night when winds are low
479,FANTASIES.,And a swell comes from the ground.
480,FANTASIES.,He sang a song like a joyous bird
481,FANTASIES.,"In wooded places and hilly,"
482,FANTASIES.,While in the hearts of those that heard
483,FANTASIES.,Pity grew like a lily.
484,FANTASIES.,
485,FANTASIES.,
486,FANTASIES.,
487,FANTASIES.,
488,FANTASIES.,The Tramp.
489,FANTASIES.,
490,FANTASIES.,
491,FANTASIES.,Forth from the ill-lit tavern door
492,FANTASIES.,Where he had snoozed and boozed before
493,FANTASIES.,Stumbled his shambling feet.
494,FANTASIES.,"A candle gave a guttering light,"
495,FANTASIES.,And some one growled a hoarse good-night....
496,FANTASIES.,The Tramp was in the street.
497,FANTASIES.,
498,FANTASIES.,"His boots were blistered, burst and patched,"
499,FANTASIES.,"He had a mildewed hat, which matched"
500,FANTASIES.,"His green, unlovely coat."
501,FANTASIES.,"Once, too, he caught his foot and swore,"
502,FANTASIES.,"And, tho' the night was warm, he wore"
503,FANTASIES.,A muffler at his throat.
504,FANTASIES.,
505,FANTASIES.,And as he went his two lips moved
506,FANTASIES.,As if he muttered songs he loved
507,FANTASIES.,"To an old, unquiet tune;"
508,FANTASIES.,"And as he went his eyes were glazed,"
509,FANTASIES.,"Twice, too, he paused like some one dazed"
510,FANTASIES.,And hiccoughed at the moon.
511,FANTASIES.,
512,FANTASIES.,Thus thro' the empty ways he passed
513,FANTASIES.,Until he reached the road at last
514,FANTASIES.,"With fields at either hand,"
515,FANTASIES.,And in the heavens bare and bright
516,FANTASIES.,The moon stood high and shed her light
517,FANTASIES.,Upon the silent land.
518,FANTASIES.,
519,FANTASIES.,"And lo! hard by, a lofty rick,"
520,FANTASIES.,"No chance was there of stab or prick,"
521,FANTASIES.,It makes a pleasant bed.
522,FANTASIES.,"And so, within, he burrowed deep,"
523,FANTASIES.,And then upon a fragrant heap
524,FANTASIES.,He laid his unclean head.
525,FANTASIES.,
526,FANTASIES.,"The moon was swallowed by a cloud,"
527,FANTASIES.,A nightingale sang sweet and loud
528,FANTASIES.,From the middle of a wood;
529,FANTASIES.,From its small body swelled a strain
530,FANTASIES.,Which flooded all the listening plain.
531,FANTASIES.,It trembled as it stood.
532,FANTASIES.,
533,FANTASIES.,"Upon his hay the Tramp awoke,"
534,FANTASIES.,"The golden fountain never broke,"
535,FANTASIES.,The lovely sobbing strain.
536,FANTASIES.,The melody of that brown bird
537,FANTASIES.,"Awoke a delicate, prisoned chord"
538,FANTASIES.,Within his sodden brain.
539,FANTASIES.,
540,FANTASIES.,The brain of him who lived remote
541,FANTASIES.,And dreamed strange things he never wrote
542,FANTASIES.,But hoarded in his mind.
543,FANTASIES.,He would not kill the dreams he loved
544,FANTASIES.,For sake of little things that moved
545,FANTASIES.,The passions of mankind.
546,FANTASIES.,
547,FANTASIES.,"Let the red torches toss and flare,"
548,FANTASIES.,"And all the long-stemmed trumpets blare,"
549,FANTASIES.,Let brass beat loud on brass.
550,FANTASIES.,"Let the Kings ride in victory,"
551,FANTASIES.,"Low comes the thought amidst the cry,"
552,FANTASIES.,"""These visions shall but pass."""
553,FANTASIES.,
554,FANTASIES.,"For, like reflections in a mirror,"
555,FANTASIES.,"Or empty bubbles on a river,"
556,FANTASIES.,The striving world passed by.
557,FANTASIES.,What seemed to others worth the winning
558,FANTASIES.,Thro' strong desire or hate of sinning
559,FANTASIES.,Brought him no energy.
560,FANTASIES.,
561,FANTASIES.,"The thunder muttering on the hills,"
562,FANTASIES.,"The song of birds, the babbling rills,"
563,FANTASIES.,"The painted flowers and stars,"
564,FANTASIES.,This pageantry of earth did seem
565,FANTASIES.,The parcel of a timeless dream.
566,FANTASIES.,He lived beyond the bars.
567,FANTASIES.,
568,FANTASIES.,It was to him a vague mirage
569,FANTASIES.,Or memory of a storied page
570,FANTASIES.,With only that appeal;
571,FANTASIES.,But oftentimes a sound or sight
572,FANTASIES.,Would bring to him his own delight
573,FANTASIES.,More subtle than the real.
574,FANTASIES.,
575,FANTASIES.,And with his sense of entity
576,FANTASIES.,"Half lost, he raised a vacant eye"
577,FANTASIES.,Into the empyrean.
578,FANTASIES.,And as he lay upon his back
579,FANTASIES.,The pealing centuries rolled back....
580,FANTASIES.,He saw the blue Ægean.
581,FANTASIES.,
582,FANTASIES.,"And thus he dreamt: ""My palace home"
583,FANTASIES.,With minaret and marble dome
584,FANTASIES.,Upon the sapphire strait.
585,FANTASIES.,"My garden full of nightingales,"
586,FANTASIES.,One singing as the other fails
587,FANTASIES.,While evening groweth late.
588,FANTASIES.,
589,FANTASIES.,"""And from my watch-tower I behold"
590,FANTASIES.,Beneath a sky of molten gold
591,FANTASIES.,My argosies return.
592,FANTASIES.,"A homeward wind is in their sails,"
593,FANTASIES.,"Freighted are they with costly bales,"
594,FANTASIES.,Vast fires behind them burn.
595,FANTASIES.,
596,FANTASIES.,"""I have a room with shining floors"
597,FANTASIES.,"And lofty roof and polished doors,"
598,FANTASIES.,Wherein I love to dine
599,FANTASIES.,"With two good friends at left and right,"
600,FANTASIES.,Whose converse is my soul's delight
601,FANTASIES.,And glads my heart like wine.
602,FANTASIES.,
603,FANTASIES.,"""Or in my marble portico"
604,FANTASIES.,We sit and watch the summer glow
605,FANTASIES.,And talk of love and death;
606,FANTASIES.,And when the amber twilight fails
607,FANTASIES.,"We listen to the nightingales,"
608,FANTASIES.,And evening holds her breath.
609,FANTASIES.,
610,FANTASIES.,"""Oh! Charicles and Charmides,"
611,FANTASIES.,"Much have I dreamt of hours like these,"
612,FANTASIES.,My friends I never knew--
613,FANTASIES.,"Whose voices and whose grave, sweet words"
614,FANTASIES.,"Were lovelier than the songs of birds,"
615,FANTASIES.,And fresher than the dew.
616,FANTASIES.,
617,FANTASIES.,"""For Charicles has love and youth,"
618,FANTASIES.,"And all his words are sweet with truth,"
619,FANTASIES.,Like a garden with the rain;
620,FANTASIES.,"And Charmides is mild and wise,"
621,FANTASIES.,"But with his tear-washed, violet eyes"
622,FANTASIES.,Yet can he smile again.
623,FANTASIES.,
624,FANTASIES.,"""Perhaps I knew you, ancient lords"
625,FANTASIES.,Of nobler wit and finer chords--
626,FANTASIES.,But this I cannot tell;
627,FANTASIES.,For ever lovely things I sought
628,FANTASIES.,"In some strange borderland of thought,"
629,FANTASIES.,Content therein to dwell.
630,FANTASIES.,
631,FANTASIES.,"""For who could blame or who could praise"
632,FANTASIES.,If one should choose to pass his days
633,FANTASIES.,"In a phantasy of dreams,"
634,FANTASIES.,"And, finding thus his own ideal"
635,FANTASIES.,"In things dissevered from the real,"
636,FANTASIES.,Be happier than he seems?
637,FANTASIES.,
638,FANTASIES.,"""Ah! who could praise or who could blame,"
639,FANTASIES.,"Tho' glimmers all my way the same,"
640,FANTASIES.,Like a dyke-road thro' a fen.
641,FANTASIES.,"Far on, far on--a ruddy spark--"
642,FANTASIES.,"The toll-light glows adown the dark,"
643,FANTASIES.,"And I, like other men,"
644,FANTASIES.,
645,FANTASIES.,"""Must pay my toll and pass beyond,--"
646,FANTASIES.,"I made no vow, I signed no bond,"
647,FANTASIES.,"Nor lose my self-esteem,"
648,FANTASIES.,"But pass, unknown, unloved, unlost,"
649,FANTASIES.,"The man who knew and weighed the cost,"
650,FANTASIES.,The man who dared to dream.
651,FANTASIES.,
652,FANTASIES.,"""For what is Fame and what's a Name,"
653,FANTASIES.,"Your cries of sorrow, wrath, and shame,"
654,FANTASIES.,"Your Hamlets and King Lears,"
655,FANTASIES.,The night must cover them again
656,FANTASIES.,"Did they last a thousand lives of men,"
657,FANTASIES.,A thousand thousand years.
658,FANTASIES.,
659,FANTASIES.,"""The world may say that I have missed;"
660,FANTASIES.,Ah! no--I am an egoist
661,FANTASIES.,"Of subtle, fixed design."
662,FANTASIES.,My dreams a garden are to me
663,FANTASIES.,"To which no other holds the key,"
664,FANTASIES.,I wish to keep them mine.
665,FANTASIES.,
666,FANTASIES.,"""All mine--those tender, half-thought things,"
667,FANTASIES.,Which flutter gossamer rainbow wings
668,FANTASIES.,"And hover near, near, near."
669,FANTASIES.,Why should I catch and pin them down
670,FANTASIES.,And lose their beauty for a crown
671,FANTASIES.,Would chafe my brows to wear.
672,FANTASIES.,
673,FANTASIES.,"""And thus, a baser alchemist"
674,FANTASIES.,In some perverted plan persist
675,FANTASIES.,To turn my gold to dross.
676,FANTASIES.,If I turned my gold their soul were sold
677,FANTASIES.,"Tho' I wore a crown and cloth of gold,"
678,FANTASIES.,Their soul were then the loss.
679,FANTASIES.,
680,FANTASIES.,"""If I sat high, a crownèd king,"
681,FANTASIES.,"With lofty brows in a royal ring,"
682,FANTASIES.,"A lustrous diadem,"
683,FANTASIES.,"If I wore the titles 'High, Strong, and Wise,'"
684,FANTASIES.,"And garments stained with purple dyes,"
685,FANTASIES.,All jewelled at the hem
686,FANTASIES.,
687,FANTASIES.,"""With emeralds, rubies and jacinth stones,"
688,FANTASIES.,"Such as great kings wear on their golden thrones,"
689,FANTASIES.,"And a royal mantle of vair,"
690,FANTASIES.,"And held a sceptre in my hand,"
691,FANTASIES.,"Which showed me ruler of all the land,"
692,FANTASIES.,"In my palace, where none might dare"
693,FANTASIES.,
694,FANTASIES.,"""To cross my word, but all must bow"
695,FANTASIES.,"As the courtly throng are bending now,"
696,FANTASIES.,"And give the King his meed,"
697,FANTASIES.,And slaves waved forests of peacock fans
698,FANTASIES.,"And a cry went up like a single man's,"
699,FANTASIES.,'This is the King indeed.'
700,FANTASIES.,
701,FANTASIES.,"""For I could be King and Overlord"
702,FANTASIES.,"In the wondrous realm of the written word,"
703,FANTASIES.,Am King there ... in my dreams.
704,FANTASIES.,"So, loving dreams, this life I choose--"
705,FANTASIES.,"The tramp's with tattered coat and shoes,"
706,FANTASIES.,Yet happier than it seems.
707,FANTASIES.,
708,FANTASIES.,"""Thus, oh! my dreams, you grow not old,"
709,FANTASIES.,"No process dims you, leaves you cold,"
710,FANTASIES.,"Immortal, bright, you come,"
711,FANTASIES.,"And if you come not, I am wise,"
712,FANTASIES.,"I have my trusted old allies,"
713,FANTASIES.,"Tobacco, beer, and rum."""
714,FANTASIES.,
715,FANTASIES.,"His chin sank down upon his breast,"
716,FANTASIES.,And suddenly the brown bird ceased
717,FANTASIES.,To pour her strain abroad.
718,FANTASIES.,A sound less sweet to mortal ear
719,FANTASIES.,Uprose (had one been there to hear)....
720,FANTASIES.,It was the tramp who snored.

728,FANTASIES.,Certain it is that of those qualities
729,FANTASIES.,We are enamoured which we most do lack.
730,FANTASIES.,"So he, fantastic out of human guise,"
731,FANTASIES.,"Bent, broken, bowed, small, apish, humped of back,"
732,FANTASIES.,"Marred in the mint, perfection's contrary,"
733,FANTASIES.,"To sweet perfection found his marred life thrall,"
734,FANTASIES.,And--the great artist without jealousy--
735,FANTASIES.,Knew beauty more than all.
736,FANTASIES.,
737,FANTASIES.,"Much he loved flowers and their frail loveliness,"
738,FANTASIES.,"But if they pined thro' blight or thirsty want,"
739,FANTASIES.,"Or spiteful wind had made his blossoms less,"
740,FANTASIES.,"Or mouse or mole had gnawed some tender plant,"
741,FANTASIES.,"Then seemed the edge of life all dull and blunt,"
742,FANTASIES.,"And passion thwarted tore his twisted frame,"
743,FANTASIES.,"And, 'neath the penthouse of the shaggy front,"
744,FANTASIES.,The yellow eyes flashed flame.
745,FANTASIES.,
746,FANTASIES.,"But most he joyed whenever country maid,"
747,FANTASIES.,"Prizing his taste, or damsel highly born"
748,FANTASIES.,"To judgment came, and anxiously displayed"
749,FANTASIES.,For him submission as for others scorn.
750,FANTASIES.,"Then, peering keenly from his peat-roofed home,"
751,FANTASIES.,"Calm in his power he scanned her as he chose,"
752,FANTASIES.,"And, if she pleased, the swart and twisted gnome"

867,SONGS.,And the great waters are.
868,SONGS.,
869,SONGS.,"""Or who can say at the parting day"
870,SONGS.,That he will see once more
871,SONGS.,"His children's faces in happy places,"
872,SONGS.,"His true wife at the door?"""
873,SONGS.,
874,SONGS.,"Snorro the Viking, his thigh striking,"
875,SONGS.,Laughed in his big red beard.
876,SONGS.,"""Some are bound by sight and sound."
877,SONGS.,While some have wished and feared.
878,SONGS.,
879,SONGS.,"""Their days dream as a droning stream"
880,SONGS.,Or moonlight in a wood.
881,SONGS.,"Now who can sate his love or hate,"
882,SONGS.,And the tumult of his blood?
883,SONGS.,
884,SONGS.,"""Then cast the die for the open sky"
885,SONGS.,"When the great sun beats abroad,"
886,SONGS.,"For the foam-fleck and the narrow deck,"
887,SONGS.,The life of oar and sword.
888,SONGS.,
889,SONGS.,"""Life and limb for the wind's hymn,"
890,SONGS.,"And all the fears that be,"
891,SONGS.,"The ghost-races with ghastly faces,"
892,SONGS.,The phantoms of the sea.
893,SONGS.,
894,SONGS.,"""Mine is the morrow,"" shouted Snorro,"
895,SONGS.,"""I longed and have not feared."""
896,SONGS.,And his great laughter followed after
897,SONGS.,And rumbled in his beard.
898,SONGS.,
899,SONGS.,
900,SONGS.,
901,SONGS.,
902,SONGS.,The Island.
903,SONGS.,
904,SONGS.,
905,SONGS.,"Once (was it long ago, dear?"
906,SONGS.,Oh! hark to the sighing seas.)
907,SONGS.,We sailed to a wonderful Island
908,SONGS.,"In the golden Antipodes,"
909,SONGS.,"Where the waves wore an azure mantle,"
910,SONGS.,"The winds were ever at rest,"
911,SONGS.,For we'd left the Old World behind us
912,SONGS.,A thousand leagues to the West.
913,SONGS.,
914,SONGS.,We came to that wonderful Island;
915,SONGS.,Girt by a ring of foam
916,SONGS.,It lay in the sea like a jewel
917,SONGS.,Under an azure dome.
918,SONGS.,"The cliffs were all gold in the sunlight,"
919,SONGS.,"The strand was a floor of gold,"
920,SONGS.,So we knew we'd come to the Island
921,SONGS.,We'd read of in tales of old.
922,SONGS.,
923,SONGS.,Was it long we stayed in our Island?
924,SONGS.,"(Dear, I can never say)"
925,SONGS.,I know we walked on the mountains
926,SONGS.,Which looked far over the bay.
927,SONGS.,I know that we laughed for pleasure
928,SONGS.,(Were we wise or a couple of fools?)
929,SONGS.,As we gazed at the painted fishes
930,SONGS.,Which swam in the shallow pools.
931,SONGS.,
932,SONGS.,And night drew over our Island
933,SONGS.,"The purple pall of the skies,"
934,SONGS.,The air was heavy with fragrance
935,SONGS.,"And soft with the breath of sighs,"
936,SONGS.,"And voices out of the forest,"
937,SONGS.,"Voices out of the sea,"
938,SONGS.,Told the eternal secret....
939,SONGS.,Told it to you and me.
940,SONGS.,
941,SONGS.,"And the stars came down from the heavens,"
942,SONGS.,"And the magical tropic moon,"
943,SONGS.,To dance a measure together
944,SONGS.,Over the still lagoon;
945,SONGS.,"And the whisper of distant forests,"
946,SONGS.,"The noise of the surf in our ears,"
947,SONGS.,Seemed like the song of the ages
948,SONGS.,Sung by the passing years.
949,SONGS.,
950,SONGS.,"But we said ""farewell"" to our Island"
951,SONGS.,Which we had discovered alone....
952,SONGS.,The sand ... and the palms ... and the headland....
953,SONGS.,The westering wind ... and the sun.
954,SONGS.,"We said ""farewell"" to our Island"
955,SONGS.,(Oh! hark to the sullen rain!)
956,SONGS.,... And I knew as it fell behind us
957,SONGS.,We should not see it again.
958,SONGS.,
959,SONGS.,For only a few may go there
960,SONGS.,"And they but once may go,"
961,SONGS.,With glamour of stars above them
962,SONGS.,And the swinging seas below.
963,SONGS.,"But I still hear its forests whisper,"
964,SONGS.,"The noise of the surf on the shore,"
965,SONGS.,In that far-off wonderful Island
966,SONGS.,Which I shall see no more.
967,SONGS.,
968,SONGS.,
969,SONGS.,
970,SONGS.,
971,SONGS.,Fair Filamelle.
972,SONGS.,
973,SONGS.,
974,SONGS.,Fair Filamelle is my distress
975,SONGS.,With all her cruel backwardness.
976,SONGS.,"She will not listen to my pain,"
977,SONGS.,But turneth from me in disdain.
978,SONGS.,"That fair Filamelle,"
979,SONGS.,Her disdain is now my hell.
980,SONGS.,"She hath bewitched me with her eyes,"
981,SONGS.,"As Circe did the sailor wise,"
982,SONGS.,"Or Egypt did the Roman Prince,"
983,SONGS.,Two thousand years agone.
984,SONGS.,"I've little else but weeping since,"
985,SONGS.,My heart is like a stone.
986,SONGS.,
987,SONGS.,If you like laughter's silver sound
988,SONGS.,"Why have you dealt me such a wound,"
989,SONGS.,If youth and beauty look askance
990,SONGS.,"At glum and heavy countenance,"
991,SONGS.,"Why is it coy and cruel,"
992,SONGS.,Adding to my fire more fuel?
993,SONGS.,"Alas! Alas! it has no care,"
994,SONGS.,"Free as the birds which flit in air,"
995,SONGS.,"Nor heedfulness has any,"
996,SONGS.,"Else were its kindness not so rare,"
997,SONGS.,Its victims then so many.
998,SONGS.,
999,SONGS.,"Ah! fair Filamelle, have pity on my moan,"
1000,SONGS.,"Else must I die alone,"
1001,SONGS.,My heart is like a stone.

1007,SONGS.,
1008,SONGS.,
1009,SONGS.,"I have no skill in Love's soft war,"
1010,SONGS.,Nor am I bold to woo
1011,SONGS.,In the same sort that conquerors are
1012,SONGS.,When they are lovers too.
1013,SONGS.,Tho' passion thunders in my brain
1014,SONGS.,"Like ocean on a beach,"
1015,SONGS.,My tongue is bounden with a chain
1016,SONGS.,And manacled my speech.
1017,SONGS.,"Yet, could I let one word go free"
1018,SONGS.,"To touch your chords with fire,"
1019,SONGS.,Become the wind upon the sea
1020,SONGS.,"The plectrum of the lyre,"
1021,SONGS.,"Then, my Althea, should we be"
1022,SONGS.,"Two lovers without shame,"
1023,SONGS.,"All things in their epitome,"
1024,SONGS.,The Universe our name.
1025,SONGS.,Then should we bow to Love's command
1026,SONGS.,As the waves kiss the shore
1027,SONGS.,And the rain falls upon the land
1028,SONGS.,That it may thirst no more.
1029,SONGS.,"Then should we kiss, with time at bay"
1030,SONGS.,"As in the Ajalon valley,"
1031,SONGS.,A score--two score--two hundred--nay
1032,SONGS.,We would not keep the tally--
1033,SONGS.,"A hundred thousand in one bout,"
1034,SONGS.,"Ten myriads ere we slumbered,"
1035,SONGS.,And the stars winked and all went out

1047,SONGS.,"Were the strengthless words of the Dead,"
1048,SONGS.,"Meaningless, nothing importing."
1049,SONGS.,
1050,SONGS.,Out of the dark I return
1051,SONGS.,And the House of the Dead;
1052,SONGS.,The endless regions of gloom
1053,SONGS.,Deep sepulchred in the womb
1054,SONGS.,"Of Earth, the mother of all things."
1055,SONGS.,
1056,SONGS.,"Out of the dark I return,"
1057,SONGS.,From the stream of the Dead;
1058,SONGS.,I slew a goat on the brink
1059,SONGS.,And they pressed around me to drink
1060,SONGS.,Their shadowy twittering legions.
1061,SONGS.,
1062,SONGS.,"Out of the dark I return,"
1063,SONGS.,From the speech of the Dead;
1064,SONGS.,"I asked them for counsel and word,"
1065,SONGS.,They twittered like bats when they heard
1066,SONGS.,And wailed for the warm blood flowing.
1067,SONGS.,
1068,SONGS.,Out of the dark I return;
1069,SONGS.,"(Ye are baffled, Oh! Dead);"
1070,SONGS.,"Lost hopes, lost hearts, lost loves,"
1071,SONGS.,"Hollow-eyed, hollow-cheeked are your droves,"
1072,SONGS.,I drew my sword and ye vanished.
1073,SONGS.,
1074,SONGS.,Out of the dark I return
1075,SONGS.,And the dust of desire;
1076,SONGS.,My ears are still filled with the shrieks
1077,SONGS.,Of the pitiful Dead and my cheeks
1078,SONGS.,Still pale with the paleness of Hades.
1079,SONGS.,
1080,SONGS.,Out of the dark I return
1081,SONGS.,"For the day, for the deed;"
1082,SONGS.,"And now to Apollo, the slayer,"
1083,SONGS.,I stand and utter a prayer
1084,SONGS.,"Humbly, first making obeisance."

1101,STORIES IN VERSE.,"Wonderful, white, and gracious"

1106,STORIES IN VERSE.,"(As he lay upon his bed),"
1107,STORIES IN VERSE.,"Wonderful, white, and gracious,"

1117,STORIES IN VERSE.,He rose from his troubled bed

1122,STORIES IN VERSE.,"""I will fashion a wondrous thing"
1123,STORIES IN VERSE.,To stand in a palace of onyx
1124,STORIES IN VERSE.,"And blind the eyes of a king."""
1125,STORIES IN VERSE.,He said in the pride of his soul
1126,STORIES IN VERSE.,"As the birds began to sing,"
1127,STORIES IN VERSE.,"""I will surely take no rest"
1128,STORIES IN VERSE.,Till I fashion this wondrous thing.
1129,STORIES IN VERSE.,I will swear an oath to eschew
1130,STORIES IN VERSE.,"The white wine and the red,"
1131,STORIES IN VERSE.,To eat no delicate meats
1132,STORIES IN VERSE.,"Nor break the fair, white bread."
1133,STORIES IN VERSE.,I will not walk in the city

1137,STORIES IN VERSE.,"Six days he wrought at the marble,"
1138,STORIES IN VERSE.,"But cunning had left his hand,"

1140,STORIES IN VERSE.,What his soul could understand.
1141,STORIES IN VERSE.,"Six days he fasted and travailed,"
1142,STORIES IN VERSE.,"Hard was the watch to keep,"
1143,STORIES IN VERSE.,So the chisel fell from his fingers
1144,STORIES IN VERSE.,And he sank with a sob to sleep.
1145,STORIES IN VERSE.,But a vision came to his slumber
1146,STORIES IN VERSE.,"Beautiful as before,"
1147,STORIES IN VERSE.,Floating in with the moonbeam
1148,STORIES IN VERSE.,Gliding over the floor.
1149,STORIES IN VERSE.,It floated in with the moonbeam
1150,STORIES IN VERSE.,"And stood beside his bed,"
1151,STORIES IN VERSE.,"Wonderful, white, and gracious,"
1152,STORIES IN VERSE.,And this was the word it said.

1176,STORIES IN VERSE.,Once ... I seem to remember....
1177,STORIES IN VERSE.,Crept in the noonday heat
1178,STORIES IN VERSE.,A boy with a crooked shadow
1179,STORIES IN VERSE.,Which capered along the street.
1180,STORIES IN VERSE.,A boy whose shadow was mocked at
1181,STORIES IN VERSE.,"By the children passing along,"
1182,STORIES IN VERSE.,"Straight and tall and beautiful,"
1183,STORIES IN VERSE.,Happy with laughter and song.
1184,STORIES IN VERSE.,"So, he envied their beauty...."
1185,STORIES IN VERSE.,He who was crooked and brown....
1186,STORIES IN VERSE.,"The strong youths of the mountain,"
1187,STORIES IN VERSE.,"The white girls of the town,"
1188,STORIES IN VERSE.,Envied their happy meetings
1189,STORIES IN VERSE.,And the tender words they spoke
1190,STORIES IN VERSE.,"In the shadow of the temples,"
1191,STORIES IN VERSE.,Under the groves of oak.
1192,STORIES IN VERSE.,And his lonely heart was stricken
1193,STORIES IN VERSE.,That never his lot might be
1194,STORIES IN VERSE.,To walk with a maid who loved him....
1195,STORIES IN VERSE.,So quaint and crooked was he.
1196,STORIES IN VERSE.,
1197,STORIES IN VERSE.,
1198,II,II
1199,II,
1200,II,Thus was my heart once stricken
1201,II,"And I repined for a while,"
1202,II,"I but a boy in years,"
1203,II,Who longed for a maiden's smile.
1204,II,Till once on a day in summer
1205,II,"My soul was touched with a gleam,"
1206,II,And I woke from my morbid fancies
1207,II,"Like one from an evil dream,"
1208,II,And knew that the gods in their wisdom
1209,II,Had made and set me apart.
1210,II,"Lean, misshapen, and ugly...."
1211,II,No toy for a maiden's heart.
1212,II,And I felt with a heart awakened
1213,II,"That leapt in a riot of joy,"
1214,II,The heart of a wise man and proud
1215,II,Not the heart of a moody boy.
1216,II,Viewing the old things anew
1217,II,With an inner wonder in each:
1218,II,"The cloud ships driven thro' heaven,"
1219,II,"The sea rolling into the beach,"
1220,II,"The magic heart of the woodland,"
1221,II,"The loves of nymph and faun,"
1222,II,"The splendour of starlight nights,"
1223,II,The calm inviolate dawn.
1224,II,
1225,II,
1226,III,III
1227,III,
1228,III,"Thus was my spirit quickened,"
1229,III,And once on a lucky day
1230,III,"I drew a bird on plaster,"
1231,III,And modelled a horse in clay;
1232,III,Kneeling under a wall
1233,III,"Where a shadow fell on the street,"
1234,III,Eyes and mind intent
1235,III,In the midst of the noonday heat.
1236,III,Eyes and mind intent....
1237,III,"And a stranger passed my way,"
1238,III,... The shadow grew and lengthened
1239,III,As he stopped to watch my play.
1240,III,"He looked at the little horse,"
1241,III,He looked at the winging bird;
1242,III,And ere I noticed his presence
1243,III,He touched me and spoke a word:
1244,III,"""Hast thou the mind and will"
1245,III,As thou hast hand and sight...?
1246,III,Follow me if thou hast
1247,III,"And climb ... oh! climb to the height."""
1248,III,
1249,III,
1250,IV,IV
1251,IV,
1252,IV,So I followed him to his workshop
1253,IV,And stayed there a year and a year
1254,IV,Working under a master
1255,IV,"Who praised me and held me dear,"
1256,IV,Till at last a day arose
1257,IV,"When, taking my hand in his own,"
1258,IV,"""You have my knowledge,"" he said,"
1259,IV,"""And now you must stand alone."""
1260,IV,And tho' I sorrowed to leave him
1261,IV,"My heart was ready to sing,"
1262,IV,So first in praise of the gods
1263,IV,I made for an offering
1264,IV,(Even as does a shepherd
1265,IV,His rustic altar of sods)
1266,IV,Bright forms larger than human
1267,IV,As mortals dream of the gods.
1268,IV,"Then, in my strange world-worship,"
1269,IV,"The Tritons, Lords of the Sea,"
1270,IV,"The creatures which haunt the woodland,"
1271,IV,"Happy and shy and free,"
1272,IV,Nymphs and satyrs and fauns
1273,IV,"Who worship the great god Pan,"
1274,IV,And lastly the mighty heroes
1275,IV,Who fashion the mind of man.
1276,IV,
1277,IV,
1278,V,V
1279,V,
1280,V,"Thus thought I and thus wrought I,"
1281,V,And my power grew greater still.
1282,V,I rose to the heights of passion
1283,V,"And sounded the depths of will,"
1284,V,Reaching out to the farthest
1285,V,"Winnowing down to the last,"
1286,V,Gazing into the future
1287,V,And diving into the past.
1288,V,Higher and ever higher
1289,V,Like an eagle soared my art
1290,V,And I praised the most high gods
1291,V,Who made and set me apart.
1292,V,And Prince and poet and painter
1293,V,"Travelled to touch my hand,"
1294,V,"The minds which had toiled and suffered,"
1295,V,"The minds which could understand,"
1296,V,Marvelling in my workshop
1297,V,At the shining forms they saw....
1298,V,The children of my spirit
1299,V,Born of a higher law.
1300,V,
1301,V,
1302,VI,VI
1303,VI,
1304,VI,But last on a day in summer
1305,VI,(An evil day it seems)
1306,VI,"I thought, ""I will fashion a woman"
1307,VI,As I have seen in dreams.
1308,VI,"I, who never loved woman"
1309,VI,"That breathed and spoke and moved,"
1310,VI,Will fashion a noble statue
1311,VI,To show what I could have loved;
1312,VI,A glorious naked figure
1313,VI,"Untouched by time or fate,"
1314,VI,A symbol of all that might be
1315,VI,And she shall be my mate.
1316,VI,"Not mate of my crooked body,"
1317,VI,"Lean, misshapen and brown,"
1318,VI,(No longer I feared my shadow
1319,VI,But walked a prince in the town)
1320,VI,But mate for my glorious spirit
1321,VI,"Winging thro' shimmering heights,"
1322,VI,On the viewless pinions of fancy
1323,VI,"Where none can follow its flights."""
1324,VI,Thus was I moved in spirit
1325,VI,"And wrought, a happy slave,"
1326,VI,Striving to make the best
1327,VI,"Of the gifts the high gods gave,"
1328,VI,"Fashioning out of the marble,"
1329,VI,--And I knew my work was good--
1330,VI,The arms and the breasts and the thighs
1331,VI,And the glory of womanhood.
1332,VI,
1333,VI,
1334,VII,VII
1335,VII,
1336,VII,Lo! the statue is finished.
1337,VII,Look how it stands serene
1338,VII,A woman with tender smile
1339,VII,And proud eyes of a queen!
1340,VII,Lo! the statue is perfect....
1341,VII,Flower and crown of my life....
1342,VII,I who never loved woman
1343,VII,Could take this woman for wife....
1344,VII,"Her, my Galatea,"
1345,VII,"My wonderful milk-white friend,"
1346,VII,Work of my hand and brain
1347,VII,Linked to this noble end.
1348,VII,
1349,VII,
1350,VIII,VIII
1351,VIII,
1352,VIII,"The statue stands above me,"
1353,VIII,Flower and crown of my art....
1354,VIII,But would that the gods had made me
1355,VIII,"As others, not set me apart."
1356,VIII,"For what, in the measure of life,"
1357,VIII,Is work on a lower plane?
1358,VIII,"And this the finest, brightest--"
1359,VIII,Further I cannot attain.
1360,VIII,Shall I grind its beauty to fragments
1361,VIII,Or shatter its symmetry?--
1362,VIII,For I have made it in secret
1363,VIII,And none has seen it but me.
1364,VIII,My hand would falter and fail--
1365,VIII,Oh! ... I could not forget.
1366,VIII,I still should see it in dreams
1367,VIII,With a passion of regret.
1368,VIII,Or ... Shall I wait till morning
1369,VIII,"White-winged over the land,"
1370,VIII,Ere the fishermen tramp the beach
1371,VIII,And drag their boats to the sand;
1372,VIII,And find at last ... oh! at last
1373,VIII,"A boon denied to me,"
1374,VIII,"Rest in the ever-restless,"
1375,VIII,"The huge, unquiet sea,"
1376,VIII,That the brain may be freed from toil
1377,VIII,Which has toiled to a luckless end
1378,VIII,When it touched its highest powers
1379,VIII,And shaped my milk-white friend.
1380,VIII,
1381,VIII,
1382,IX,IX
1383,IX,
1384,IX,"For a dream is only a dream,"
1385,IX,(My best and my last stands there)
1386,IX,"And a stone is only a stone,"
1387,IX,"Be it carven beyond compare,"
1388,IX,And the veriest hind of the field
1389,IX,"Who sweats for his hungry brood,"
1390,IX,Has a deeper knowledge than I
1391,IX,Of our mortal evil and good.
1392,IX,"Oh! gods, if ever I sought you,"
1393,IX,"And found you, terrible lords,"
1394,IX,"Zeus in the rattling thunder,"
1395,IX,Ares in din of swords;
1396,IX,"And thou, wise grey-eyed lady,"
1397,IX,"Who lovest the sober mean,"
1398,IX,"Reason and grave discourses,"
1399,IX,"A tempered mind and serene,"
1400,IX,You have I duly honoured--
1401,IX,"Yet one have I kept apart,"
1402,IX,"(Lean, misshapen, and ugly"
1403,IX,No toy for a maiden's heart).
1404,IX,"""Oh! foam-begotten and smiling,"
1405,IX,"Oh, perilous child of the sea--"
1406,IX,Forgive--ere too late--and befriend me!
1407,IX,"What am I--what is life without thee?"""
1408,IX,And his prayer went up like a vapour
1409,IX,"To the palace above the snows,"
1410,IX,"Where the shining gods held revel,"
1411,IX,And deathless laughter arose.
1412,IX,But Hupnos swiftly descended
1413,IX,Like a noiseless bird of the night
1414,IX,And brushed his eyes with pinions
1415,IX,"Downy and thick and light,"
1416,IX,"Circled dimly about him,"
1417,IX,And brushed his eyes as he prayed
1418,IX,"Laying a drowsy mandate,"
1419,IX,And the watcher drooped and obeyed.
1420,IX,
1421,IX,
1422,X,X
1423,X,
1424,X,In at the workshop windows
1425,X,Peacefully stole the dawn;
1426,X,Tinting the marble figures
1427,X,"Of wood-nymph, goddess and faun,"
1428,X,Broadening in a streamer
1429,X,Which touched with a rosy glow
1430,X,"The still white form of the statue,"
1431,X,The sleeper kneeling below.
1432,X,... She moved as the red light touched her
1433,X,"And life stirred under her hair,"
1434,X,A little shiver ran over
1435,X,Her glorious limbs all bare.
1436,X,Thro' arms and breasts and thighs
1437,X,The warm blood pulsed and ran:
1438,X,And she stepped down from the pedestal--
1439,X,A woman unto a man;
1440,X,Saying in tender accents
1441,X,Of low and musical tone:
1442,X,"""Oh! sleeper, wake from thy slumber"
1443,X,"No longer art thou alone...."""
1444,X,
1445,X,
1446,X,
1447,X,
1448,X,Alexis.
1449,X,
1450,X,
1451,X,Who slew Alexis? Some one smote
1452,X,Right thro' the white and tender throat
1453,X,(And scarce gave time for fear)
1454,X,"The jewelled doll, who sprang from kings,"
1455,X,"With farded cheek and flashing rings,"
1456,X,And left him lying here.
1457,X,
1458,X,"He sat upon a throne, pardye,"
1459,X,"The ancient throne of Muscovy,"
1460,X,"Smiling a harlot's smile,"
1461,X,And gave--the painted popinjay--
1462,X,"The word which no man might gainsay,"
1463,X,Tossing his curls the while.
1464,X,
1465,X,"And savage warriors, steel on hips,"
1466,X,"Muttered between their bearded lips,"
1467,X,"And spat upon the floor,"
1468,X,To see a thing so debonnaire
1469,X,"Enthroned upon a conqueror's chair,"
1470,X,And find their King half-whore.
1471,X,
1472,X,"Or in a gallery all aflare,"
1473,X,"Approached by some dark palace stair,"
1474,X,"He lay in languid mood,"
1475,X,"And naked women, mad with wine,"
1476,X,Did cruelty and lust combine
1477,X,To stir his tainted blood.
1478,X,
1479,X,"So plunged, half woman and half devil,"
1480,X,"In many a foul and roaring revel,"
1481,X,"By some fierce craving fanned,"
1482,X,"Alexis, with the girlish face"
1483,X,"And swaying movements full of grace,"
1484,X,The Ruler of this Land.
1485,X,
1486,X,"So, hunted by a mind diseased,"
1487,X,"By those fierce orgies unappeased,"
1488,X,He thirsted after new;
1489,X,And monstrous things he did (they say)
1490,X,"Which never saw the light of day,"
1491,X,Shared by a chosen few.
1492,X,
1493,X,"The rocks were cleft to bring him treasure,"
1494,X,"The mothers mourned to give him pleasure,"
1495,X,"The whole land writhed in pain,"
1496,X,"All night the secret chambers flared,"
1497,X,All night the horrid deeds were dared
1498,X,Which made him thirst again.
1499,X,
1500,X,"And pampered Turks lived by his side,"
1501,X,"With gobbling negroes bloodshot-eyed,"
1502,X,And hags with mouths impure.
1503,X,And day and night the warders tall
1504,X,Stood watching on his castle wall
1505,X,That he might dwell secure.
1506,X,
1507,X,Strange visions did upon him throng
1508,X,"With shapes confused which held him long,"
1509,X,A riot in his brain.
1510,X,"Unbridled lust, unbounded power"
1511,X,So worked upon him in that hour....
1512,X,I think he was insane.
1513,X,
1514,X,"And I--who had no God to please,"
1515,X,And nursed him crowing on my knees--
1516,X,"I waited by the stair,"
1517,X,"And as he gave a joyous note,"
1518,X,Passed this bright iron thro' his throat
1519,X,And left him lying there.
1520,X,
1521,X,
1522,X,
1523,X,
1524,X,The King's Cloak.
1525,X,
1526,X,
1527,X,There was a King in Norroway
1528,X,"Who loved a famous sport,"
1529,X,He followed it in the sun and snow
1530,X,With the nobles of his Court.
1531,X,In all his kingdom mountainous
1532,X,Was none so swift as he
1533,X,(For so they said who ate his bread)
1534,X,At running on the ski.
1535,X,
1536,X,His black heart swelled with pride
1537,X,"As the acorn swells with the tree,"
1538,X,And from all his kingdom mountainous
1539,X,He called the men of the ski.
1540,X,From fir-pricked crag and gloomy gorge
1541,X,"Where the lonely log-huts cling,"
1542,X,And till the King's word bade them cease
1543,X,They raced before the King.
1544,X,
1545,X,"So raced they down a spear-broad track,"
1546,X,"Where never tree did grow,"
1547,X,Between the mountains and the sea
1548,X,A thousand feet below
1549,X,Till sundip in a cold pearl sky
1550,X,And a west of ageless pink
1551,X,From a withered pine to the King enthroned
1552,X,With his nobles by the brink.
1553,X,
1554,X,There ran one with the racers
1555,X,"Straight-fashioned as a sword,"
1556,X,With sail-brown cheek and eyes as deep
1557,X,As water in a fiord
1558,X,And till the King's word bade them cease
1559,X,"None passed or touched him near,"
1560,X,He leapt as frightened chamois leap
1561,X,And ran like a stricken deer.
1562,X,
1563,X,Dusk threw a hateful shadow
1564,X,On the King's countenance
1565,X,"""The guerdons of thy skill,"" cried he,"
1566,X,"""Or, boy, thy luck, perchance?"
1567,X,This figured ivory drinking horn!
1568,X,This turquoise-hilted sword!
1569,X,But ... shall I see no marvel
1570,X,"Ere day dips in the fiord?"""
1571,X,
1572,X,"""There is not in fair Norroway"
1573,X,My master on the ski
1574,X,One bolder or more skilful....
1575,X,"A marvel wouldst thou see?"""
1576,X,--Bold and high was the answer--
1577,X,"""'Twas skill not luck, Oh! King,"
1578,X,I am the swiftest.... A marvel
1579,X,"Of whom the scalds shall sing."""
1580,X,
1581,X,"""Oh! yonder stand the mountains"
1582,X,And yonder moans the sea
1583,X,And he who leapt from the topmost crag....
1584,X,A bold man would he be.
1585,X,"A bold man ... yea, a marvel"
1586,X,"For the grey-haired scalds to hymn...."""
1587,X,Day dying touched his swarthy cheek
1588,X,"With a lurid light and grim,"
1589,X,
1590,X,While he made the gloomy challenge
1591,X,"And round a murmur ran,"
1592,X,"But ... the boy bowed low and answered,"
1593,X,"""Oh! King, behold the man"
1594,X,The swiftest and the boldest
1595,X,"In thy kingdom by the sea,"
1596,X,From mountain or ... from hatred
1597,X,"What man can do, dares he."""
1598,X,
1599,X,... He swept down from the mountain
1600,X,Like an eaglet on a hare
1601,X,With bent back and swinging arms
1602,X,And tossing golden hair....
1603,X,The King stood by the precipice
1604,X,(A small sea moaned and broke)
1605,X,... Looked down over the wrinkled sea
1606,X,And swiftly loosed his cloak.
1607,X,
1608,X,... He came as an arrow is loosened....
1609,X,"As a slinger slings a stone,"
1610,X,Clutched (as the sun shot downwards)
1611,X,At one on the brink alone....
1612,X,The King leapt back ... the King laughed out....
1613,X,The great cloak floated free....
1614,X,There came no sound--tho' he listened long--
1615,X,From the darkened moaning sea.
1616,X,
1617,X,
1618,X,
1619,X,
1620,X,The Knight and the Witch.
1621,X,
1622,X,
1623,X,A voice cried over the Hills
1624,X,"""Follow the strange desire."
1625,X,"Oh! follow, follow, follow,"
1626,X,The world is on fire.
1627,X,Day burns on funeral bed
1628,X,"In flame of sky and sea,"
1629,X,"And, black against that red,"
1630,X,Is the tower where dwelleth she
1631,X,"And gazeth, white foot pressed"
1632,X,"On bruisèd heaps of bloom,"
1633,X,O'er the sea which cannot rest
1634,X,And sounds thro' her room.
1635,X,Murmurs in her room
1636,X,Thro' a casement open wide
1637,X,The sea which is a tomb
1638,X,For mariners of pride.
1639,X,"Oh! follow, follow, follow,"
1640,X,"Come quickly unto her,"
1641,X,Her body is more sweet
1642,X,"Than cassia or myrrh,"
1643,X,"She is whiter than the moon,"
1644,X,"She is stranger than death,"
1645,X,Stronger than the new moon
1646,X,Which the waters draweth.
1647,X,More lovely are her words
1648,X,More lovely is she
1649,X,Than the flight of white birds
1650,X,O'er a halcyon sea.
1651,X,She took the stars for toys--
1652,X,Her magic was so strong--
1653,X,Murmurs of earth and the noise
1654,X,Of green seas for a song.
1655,X,She leant down on the sill
1656,X,And called across the sea.
1657,X,"... Oh! follow, follow, follow,"
1658,X,"Come quickly unto me...."""
1659,X,A voice cried over the Hills
1660,X,"""Oh! come, I fail, I swoon,"
1661,X,"Pale with my love's excess,"
1662,X,Paler than our pale moon.
1663,X,"Oh! come, Oh! come, Oh! come,"
1664,X,Before the days eclipse
1665,X,We'll meet with brimming eyes
1666,X,And kiss with quivering lips.
1667,X,"Love-drunken, breast to breast,"
1668,X,"With half-closed eyes we'll kiss,"
1669,X,And reel from bliss to pain
1670,X,From pain again to bliss.
1671,X,The sea which cannot rest
1672,X,From its undernote of doom
1673,X,(We swooning breast on breast)
1674,X,Shall murmur thro' my room.
1675,X,Shall murmur all night long
1676,X,Thro' a casement open wide.
1677,X,"The sea, which is a tomb"
1678,X,"For mariners of pride,"
1679,X,With an undernote of doom
1680,X,Shall murmur evermore
1681,X,That love is in the room
1682,X,"And Death is at the door,"
1683,X,That Death will bruise to dust
1684,X,Our flower-drenched passion soon
1685,X,Darker than darkest night
1686,X,Colder than our cold moon.
1687,X,So shall it ebb and flow
1688,X,Our love like those sea-tides
1689,X,For a space ... a little space--
1690,X,"What matter? ... nought abides."""
1691,X,
1692,X,"A voice cried over the Hills,"
1693,X,"""What matter? ... all things die,"
1694,X,"Our quivering love's excess,"
1695,X,Our rose-drenched ecstasy
1696,X,As glimmering waters drawn
1697,X,"By the magic of the moon,"
1698,X,As the moon itself at dawn
1699,X,Our love shall vanish soon.
1700,X,So swift (my love-pale groom)
1701,X,A white bird wings its flight.
1702,X,"Then find you Death's cold room,"
1703,X,Darker than darkest night;
1704,X,Then find you that dark door
1705,X,(And find it all men must)
1706,X,And love there nevermore
1707,X,"But crumble back to dust,"
1708,X,And kiss there nevermore
1709,X,In flower-drenched ecstasy;
1710,X,"Too late then to implore,"
1711,X,"Too cold to hear a cry."""
1712,X,
1713,X,And then towards the shelving beach
1714,X,"A cedar shallop drew,"
1715,X,With silver prow shaped like a swan
1716,X,And sails of rainbow hue.
1717,X,Swiftly it came with a wake of foam
1718,X,And lying on its side
1719,X,"Like an arrow's flight towards the Knight,"
1720,X,Tho' none sat there to guide.
1721,X,And in the shallows by the shore
1722,X,"It came to rest at last,"
1723,X,The cordage slacked and the rainbow sail
1724,X,Flapped idly on the mast.
1725,X,And the Swan-prow with the ruby eyes
1726,X,"Opened his silver beak,"
1727,X,"And with a musical, magic voice"
1728,X,He thus began to speak.
1729,X,"""Step in, step in, my gallant lad,"
1730,X,Your youth shall be my fare.
1731,X,For you my mistress opes her door
1732,X,And combs her wine-dark hair.
1733,X,She swelled my sail with an eager wind
1734,X,"And drove me to this beach,"
1735,X,She gave strange sight to my ruby eyes
1736,X,And filled my beak with speech.
1737,X,
1738,X,"""She saw you in the magic glass"
1739,X,"The hour that she has might,"
1740,X,"As you rode across the purple heath,"
1741,X,Honour and armour bright.
1742,X,"Step in, step in, my lover bold"
1743,X,And come to the West with me
1744,X,Where the young nymphs play in the wave and lift
1745,X,Their white arms from the sea;
1746,X,And the Tritons chase the laughing rout
1747,X,"And swim by the vessel's side,"
1748,X,"Blowing on horns confusedly,"
1749,X,Or shouting words of pride.
1750,X,"You hear it now, but the time will come"
1751,X,When you shall hear no more
1752,X,"The ceaseless wash of a dreaming sea,"
1753,X,Its ripples on the shore.
1754,X,"Oh! follow, follow the sinking sun"
1755,X,"And the great white Evening Star,"
1756,X,A magic wind shall breathe behind
1757,X,"Our sail, and bear us far."""
1758,X,
1759,X,"He doffed his red-plumed casque of steel,"
1760,X,"All flaxen was his hair,"
1761,X,And he was clad from throat to heel
1762,X,"In the armour princes wear,"
1763,X,From throat to heel in silver mail
1764,X,Like a shining prince in a fairy-tale.
1765,X,
1766,X,"The witch Hegertha o'er him bent,"
1767,X,"(Ah! God, her face was fair)"
1768,X,"Her breath blew on him like a scent,"
1769,X,She touched him with her hair.
1770,X,"There was no stronger witch than this,"
1771,X,And she gave the Knight her first kiss.
1772,X,"And he was bound to her sword and hand,"
1773,X,To do whatever she might command.
1774,X,
1775,X,"Then up to her full height she drew,"
1776,X,"Down poured her hair like wine,"
1777,X,"Her pale, proud face looked sadly through"
1778,X,--A moon in a wood of pine--
1779,X,"She breathed a spell in a low, sweet tone"
1780,X,Which none of woman born could disown.
1781,X,And he was bound to her side till death
1782,X,By the spell just uttered above her breath.
1783,X,
1784,X,"She drew his soul forth with her eyes,"
1785,X,"As a drinker slakes his drouth,"
1786,X,"A little smile played sorrowful, wise,"
1787,X,About her rose-red mouth.
1788,X,"She stooped down and called his soul forth,"
1789,X,And left him naught but his body's earth.
1790,X,And he was bound to her evermore
1791,X,By the soul he lost and the word he swore.
1792,X,
1793,X,For evermore and evermore
1794,X,"In the chamber by the sea,"
1795,X,Till death should break the spell-bound door
1796,X,And end his slavery;
1797,X,In the chamber strewn with flowers in bloom
1798,X,"With a heavy scent like death,"
1799,X,Echoing ever the song of doom
1800,X,Which the sad sea moaned beneath.
1801,X,For evermore and evermore
1802,X,"Till life ceased in his side,"
1803,X,Bound to the room and the rose-strewn floor
1804,X,"And the strange, unholy bride."
1805,X,
1806,X,"And naught could save him now, when once the spell"
1807,X,"Had fallen on him, binding limbs and will,"
1808,X,"Where he sat listening to the sad sea swell,"
1809,X,Amid the roses which no time could kill.
1810,X,"Naught could restore lost courage to his eyes,"
1811,X,"The Knightly ardour that he used to feel,"
1812,X,"Or make his heart the seat of high emprise,"
1813,X,Or nerve his hand to grasp the shining steel.
1814,X,"Whether she kept him fast by her enchantment,"
1815,X,"Or drove him forth to roam death-pale and weeping,"
1816,X,"Naught could remind him what his life's fair grant meant,"
1817,X,Now that his soul was in Hegertha's keeping.
1818,X,
1819,X,
1820,X,
1821,X,
1822,X,The Dreamer.
1823,X,
1824,X,
1825,X,This is the dream of the Dreamer
1826,X,"With the grave thought-sunken eyes,"
1827,X,"Which he dreamed between sleeping and waking,"
1828,X,Between the night and the making
1829,X,Of dawn ... and he dreamed in this wise:
1830,X,
1831,X,To the gate of the dawn came a chariot
1832,X,"Which four black stallions were drawing,"
1833,X,"And a spirit charioteer,"
1834,X,"With the burning eyes of a seer,"
1835,X,Held them impatiently pawing.
1836,X,
1837,X,"He mounted the floor of the chariot,"
1838,X,And the Spirit drew together
1839,X,"His reins, his strong grip tight'ning,"
1840,X,"And his thong flashed out like a lightning,"
1841,X,And the horses rushed up to æther.
1842,X,
1843,X,The Dreamer was caught into space
1844,X,"With a pang as of ending or birth,"
1845,X,"And lo! clouds builded above him,"
1846,X,And beneath him soundless and moving
1847,X,The sea of his own little earth.
1848,X,
1849,X,"They clove the walls of the clouds,"
1850,X,And snorted each coal black stallion
1851,X,"Nursed by the Spirit, whose hair"
1852,X,"Streamed out like a banner, and bare"
1853,X,In the night was the moon--a medallion
1854,X,
1855,X,And then an ice-sheathed corpse
1856,X,With ancient glaciers and snouted
1857,X,"Craters of fires extinct,"
1858,X,Chain on chain of them linked.
1859,X,And the Lord of the Chariot shouted
1860,X,
1861,X,And shook out his hissing lash
1862,X,Over the backs of the four
1863,X,"Till they whirled up faster and faster,"
1864,X,"Till the sun became vaster and vaster,"
1865,X,And its flames leapt out with a roar
1866,X,
1867,X,"Of mountains, subsident, resurging,"
1868,X,"Innumerable, ceaseless of action,"
1869,X,Years and years into space....
1870,X,"And the Dreamer covered his face,"
1871,X,"As he rode, in his stupefaction."
1872,X,
1873,X,"They passed with a dip and a swerve,"
1874,X,"As a swallow skims the downs,"
1875,X,"Far up into the height,"
1876,X,And the stars looked down from the night
1877,X,Like the lights of distant towns.
1878,X,
1879,X,Swift is the lonely thought
1880,X,"Of a sage, a mountain-dweller,"
1881,X,But swifter far was their rush
1882,X,Thro' the awful cold and the hush
1883,X,Of the spaces interstellar.
1884,X,
1885,X,"They heard the approaching thunder,"
1886,X,And saw the glare of a comet
1887,X,Holding its destined way
1888,X,"To an undiscovered day,"
1889,X,And its tresses streamed out from it.
1890,X,
1891,X,"They broke thro' other systems,"
1892,X,"By huger alien spheres,"
1893,X,"Each in its orbit travelling,"
1894,X,The timeless skeins unravelling
1895,X,Of a law with no count of years
1896,X,
1897,X,"And came at last to a planet,"
1898,X,Girt in a gleaming ring
1899,X,"Of cloud and vapour and mist,"
1900,X,Which the light of four moons kissed
1901,X,To a wonderful milk-white thing.
1902,X,
1903,X,"Then the Spirit reined in his stallions,"
1904,X,And pointed in exultation
1905,X,"And turned his orbèd eyes,"
1906,X,Which burned with a wild surmise
1907,X,"And a dreadful penetration,"
1908,X,
1909,X,"On the Dreamer, who followed, and lo!"
1910,X,"The Heavens had changed their stations,"
1911,X,And their voids were with unknown
1912,X,And greater galaxies sown
1913,X,And altered constellations.
1914,X,
1915,X,"And, beyond, a scatter of crystals,"
1916,X,"And, beyond, bright motes in a beam,"
1917,X,"And, beyond, while the Spirit probed him"
1918,X,"To the soul in the flesh that robed him,"
1919,X,An uncountable shimmering stream.
1920,X,
1921,X,"He saw these worlds all marshalled,"
1922,X,And their ways all governed for ever;
1923,X,And he felt the sight of his soul
1924,X,Shrivel up like a fire-licked scroll
1925,X,In his insupportable terror.
1926,X,
1927,X,"Then the Spirit pointed again,"
1928,X,And wheeled the might of his horses
1929,X,"And shouted ... and down they fell,"
1930,X,"As a pebble drops in a well,"
1931,X,Thro' the worlds and the roar of their courses.
1932,X,
1933,X,"And the Dreamer looked, and behold!"
1934,X,In a point to æons withdrawn....
1935,X,"A scarce visible speck of light,"
1936,X,"His own sun like a mite,"
1937,X,And the blur of his own little dawn.
1938,X,
1939,X,
1940,II,II
1941,II,
1942,II,"Now the Dreamer, who rode by night"
1943,II,"In the car of the Spirit thro' space,"
1944,II,"Came in the blue of June morning,"
1945,II,"In a mood betwixt pity and scorning,"
1946,II,To the populous market-place.
1947,II,
1948,II,Afar in the infinite blue
1949,II,Hung the snow-capped mountain-ranges;
1950,II,But round him moved the press
1951,II,Of the city's business
1952,II,In kaleidoscopic changes.
1953,II,
1954,II,"For the square was all life and all colour,"
1955,II,"All confusion and clamour,"
1956,II,As dealers showed the paces
1957,II,"Of colts, untamed in the traces,"
1958,II,To the rap of the auctioneer's hammer.
1959,II,
1960,II,He saw there the dusty sheep
1961,II,Trotting blindly amidst the throng;
1962,II,"The swine with quivering snouts,"
1963,II,"The boys who urged them with shouts,"
1964,II,The hawkers of picture and song;
1965,II,
1966,II,The brown-skinned peasants trudging
1967,II,"By their slow-paced bullock wains,"
1968,II,"With children asprawl the load,"
1969,II,And wives who scolded and rode
1970,II,With an eye to their husbands' gains;
1971,II,
1972,II,"The hooknosed Orient merchants,"
1973,II,Who came in the caravans
1974,II,And bargained over the prices
1975,II,"Of silks and carpets and spices,"
1976,II,Pearls and feathers and fans;
1977,II,
1978,II,The clumsy sailors in ear-rings
1979,II,"From the echoing harbour beach,"
1980,II,"With parrots and shells for their wares,"
1981,II,"The light of the sun in their stares,"
1982,II,The sound of the wind in their speech.
1983,II,
1984,II,And the shrill-voiced changers of money
1985,II,Who sat with their clerks at the tables....
1986,II,And it seemed to him all no matter
1987,II,As he gazed ... like the evening chatter
1988,II,Of starlings under his gables.
1989,II,
1990,II,
1991,III,III
1992,III,
1993,III,And lo! hard by at a pillar
1994,III,"Two learned Sophists disputed,"
1995,III,Taking the turn of speech
1996,III,And disciples applauded each
1997,III,Or else each other confuted
1998,III,
1999,III,"With babble and clenching of fist,"
2000,III,"And thrusting of face into face,"
2001,III,"And saying ""Demus hath reason"""
2002,III,"Or ""Lycas hath conquered. The season"
2003,III,"Of Demus hath passed, and his place"
2004,III,
2005,III,"""Is with us no longer."" And mildly"
2006,III,The grave-eyed Dreamer watched them
2007,III,Shouting and seething and ranting.
2008,III,"But, when they perceived him, panting"
2009,III,(For a sudden impulse snatched them)
2010,III,
2011,III,Ran up a crowd of both factions
2012,III,"And cried, ""Oh! Master, befriend us,"
2013,III,"For we all of us know thou art wisest,"
2014,III,That thou speakest the truth and despisest
2015,III,No man and his need. Therefore lend us
2016,III,
2017,III,"""Thy wisdom in this our dilemma."""
2018,III,"And the Dreamer answered, ""I hear."""
2019,III,So they told him with quibble and chatter....
2020,III,And it seemed to him all no matter
2021,III,Like the croaking of frogs in a mere.

2024,IV,IV
2025,IV,
2026,IV,"And behold! there ran thro' the market,"
2027,IV,"Hard by where the Dreamer stood,"
2028,IV,"A natural, void of desire"
2029,IV,Save for warmth of the sun or of fire
2030,IV,Or for softness abed or food.
2031,IV,
2032,IV,"Naught held he dearer in mind,"
2033,IV,Save the branchèd lightning veins;
2034,IV,And in naught more strongly rejoiced
2035,IV,Save the sound of the thunder deep-voiced
2036,IV,Or the fertile flash of the rains
2037,IV,
2038,IV,Or the seas climbing into the harbour;
2039,IV,And so thro' the market he ran
2040,IV,Happy and careless and free
2041,IV,(Him no man heeded for he
2042,IV,Was a boy who would ne'er be a man)
2043,IV,
2044,IV,"Munching the gift of a cake,"
2045,IV,"A pilfered apple or fig,"
2046,IV,"Or danced with his shadow awhile,"
2047,IV,"Smiling a secret smile,"
2048,IV,Or twirled a hued whirligig.
2049,IV,
2050,IV,"And the Dreamer called to him, ""Come!"""
2051,IV,As he skipped in the sun with his Shadow.
2052,IV,And the boy came doubtful and shy
2053,IV,"With a timid foot and eye,"
2054,IV,As a young horse comes in a meadow.
2055,IV,
2056,IV,And the Dreamer touched his cheek
2057,IV,"And murmured, ""Be not afraid,"""
2058,IV,"And the boy took heart and smiled,"
2059,IV,"For the voice was tender and mild,"
2060,IV,"And then half sadly it said,"
2061,IV,
2062,IV,"""Oh! ye who have called me the Master,"
2063,IV,"The Teller of Truth, and the Wise,"
2064,IV,Oh! ye who have strayed in the dark
2065,IV,"Give ear to my saying and mark,"
2066,IV,"For I give you a pearl of price,"

2068,IV,"""A dark saying, and a hard saying"
2069,IV,To those who read it aright--
2070,IV,"This natural, whom ye see,"

2072,IV,"And thus have I learned in the night."""

2522,I,No fruit or blossom or petal blown
2523,I,"Was there to gladden mournful eyes,"

2525,I,Beneath a reign of leaden skies.
2526,I,"A red, red weed was all the flower,"
2527,I,Which crawled serpiginous about
2528,I,"The marsh, unchanged from hour to hour"

2536,I,Of low sad purple and sombre brown

2539,I,"And stiff grey grasses which bend and sigh,"
2540,I,"As the marsh wind wails and passes by,"

2580,IV,"Alone with a heart of stone,"
2581,IV,With neither tears nor hopes nor fears

2818,REFLECTIONS.,REFLECTIONS.
2819,REFLECTIONS.,
2820,REFLECTIONS.,
2821,REFLECTIONS.,
2822,REFLECTIONS.,
2823,REFLECTIONS.,The Wind and the Hills.
2824,REFLECTIONS.,
2825,REFLECTIONS.,
2826,REFLECTIONS.,We will carry our ills
2827,REFLECTIONS.,"To a height of the hills,"
2828,REFLECTIONS.,"Lying down, lying still"
2829,REFLECTIONS.,In the lap of a hill.
2830,REFLECTIONS.,
2831,REFLECTIONS.,The wind blowing keen
2832,REFLECTIONS.,"Shall again make us clean,"
2833,REFLECTIONS.,Both body and spirit;
2834,REFLECTIONS.,As it passes we shall hear it.
2835,REFLECTIONS.,
2836,REFLECTIONS.,The time is of thunder
2837,REFLECTIONS.,"And fields new turned under,"
2838,REFLECTIONS.,Of budding and waking;
2839,REFLECTIONS.,Of thorn-blossom flaking.
2840,REFLECTIONS.,
2841,REFLECTIONS.,Of longing and questing;
2842,REFLECTIONS.,Of carol and nesting;
2843,REFLECTIONS.,Of white birds on the wing
2844,REFLECTIONS.,Over seas blue with spring.
2845,REFLECTIONS.,
2846,REFLECTIONS.,But you read in the pages
2847,REFLECTIONS.,"Of the books of the sages,"
2848,REFLECTIONS.,And save that dark curtain
2849,REFLECTIONS.,"They know nothing certain,"
2850,REFLECTIONS.,
2851,REFLECTIONS.,Except that dark portal
2852,REFLECTIONS.,Which waits all things mortal--
2853,REFLECTIONS.,And conqueror or prophet
2854,REFLECTIONS.,Comprehend no more of it.
2855,REFLECTIONS.,
2856,REFLECTIONS.,Yet the wind travels so
2857,REFLECTIONS.,That it surely must know;
2858,REFLECTIONS.,It has gone the world round
2859,REFLECTIONS.,Till it came to our ground.
2860,REFLECTIONS.,
2861,REFLECTIONS.,"And the hills, which stood fast"
2862,REFLECTIONS.,Ere the first axe was cast
2863,REFLECTIONS.,"And have seen so much history,"
2864,REFLECTIONS.,May have fathomed the mystery.
2865,REFLECTIONS.,
2866,REFLECTIONS.,But the hills on our borders
2867,REFLECTIONS.,"Are silent old warders,"
2868,REFLECTIONS.,And the winds which rejoice
2869,REFLECTIONS.,No articulate voice.
2870,REFLECTIONS.,
2871,REFLECTIONS.,Oh! ye pure larger airs
2872,REFLECTIONS.,Ye will scatter our cares--
2873,REFLECTIONS.,"Mighty bastions of ours,"
2874,REFLECTIONS.,"Uplift that which cowers,"
2875,REFLECTIONS.,
2876,REFLECTIONS.,For behind your grave brows
2877,REFLECTIONS.,"Are a thousand strong ""Nows--"""
2878,REFLECTIONS.,"And the wind has a ""must"""
2879,REFLECTIONS.,In its rude healthy gust.
2880,REFLECTIONS.,
2881,REFLECTIONS.,How it braces and rightens
2882,REFLECTIONS.,That wind to make Titans!
2883,REFLECTIONS.,Its strenuous wooing
2884,REFLECTIONS.,"Says, ""Up, lads, and doing."""
2885,REFLECTIONS.,
2886,REFLECTIONS.,So leaving the high down
2887,REFLECTIONS.,Like giants we stride down;
2888,REFLECTIONS.,While the valleys before us
2889,REFLECTIONS.,Resound to our chorus.
2890,REFLECTIONS.,
2891,REFLECTIONS.,Having been each a seer
2892,REFLECTIONS.,"To whom all things were near,"
2893,REFLECTIONS.,Not resenting or grieving
2894,REFLECTIONS.,But simply believing.
2895,REFLECTIONS.,
2896,REFLECTIONS.,
2897,REFLECTIONS.,
2898,REFLECTIONS.,
2899,REFLECTIONS.,The Happy Ones.
2900,REFLECTIONS.,
2901,REFLECTIONS.,
2902,REFLECTIONS.,They awaited with head erect
2903,REFLECTIONS.,Whatever fate could befall them;
2904,REFLECTIONS.,"Tried but the good to recollect,"
2905,REFLECTIONS.,Cried for the truth to call them.
2906,REFLECTIONS.,To be loved by the children of other suns
2907,REFLECTIONS.,"And send a message to find them,"
2908,REFLECTIONS.,This is the fate of the happiest ones
2909,REFLECTIONS.,Tho' the mortar of life may grind them.
2910,REFLECTIONS.,They were like swimmers breasting the waves
2911,REFLECTIONS.,"In the troughs of a stormy channel,"
2912,REFLECTIONS.,"They are silent now in their lonely graves,"
2913,REFLECTIONS.,But the world has become the panel.
2914,REFLECTIONS.,They wore the truth like a bridal dress
2915,REFLECTIONS.,"And sorrow like wedding apparel,"
2916,REFLECTIONS.,Tho' the placid laughed at their foolishness
2917,REFLECTIONS.,And the cynic sneered from his barrel.
2918,REFLECTIONS.,"Or like the wandering Ishmaelites,"
2919,REFLECTIONS.,"Who found no city to dwell in,"
2920,REFLECTIONS.,"Whose lonely hearts ached for pleasant sights,"
2921,REFLECTIONS.,"Whose graves were the places they fell in,"
2922,REFLECTIONS.,"Rock their pillow and sand their bed,"
2923,REFLECTIONS.,As the sun of the desert paints them;
2924,REFLECTIONS.,"The fierce kites screaming overhead,"
2925,REFLECTIONS.,And the hands of all men against them.
2926,REFLECTIONS.,"But a word goes out and over the earth,"
2927,REFLECTIONS.,"From the silent burying-places,"
2928,REFLECTIONS.,"Like a gentle rain in a land of dearth,"
2929,REFLECTIONS.,And lights up the tired faces.
2930,REFLECTIONS.,It brings a roof and a sweet abode
2931,REFLECTIONS.,To many a soul that is vagrant;
2932,REFLECTIONS.,Their names are blossoms along the road
2933,REFLECTIONS.,And their lives are for ever fragrant.
2934,REFLECTIONS.,"We who sorrow are brothers of theirs,"
2935,REFLECTIONS.,"Because of their beautiful sorrows,"
2936,REFLECTIONS.,"Wheat will grow up among the tares,"
2937,REFLECTIONS.,And young corn grow in the furrows.
2938,REFLECTIONS.,
2939,REFLECTIONS.,
2940,REFLECTIONS.,
2941,REFLECTIONS.,
2942,REFLECTIONS.,A Question.
2943,REFLECTIONS.,
2944,REFLECTIONS.,
2945,REFLECTIONS.,Why do you prate to me
2946,REFLECTIONS.,"Of deeds unjust and just,"
2947,REFLECTIONS.,Moved by a story of good
2948,REFLECTIONS.,Or a monstrous tale of crimes--
2949,REFLECTIONS.,Me that can have no loves
2950,REFLECTIONS.,"But star-eyed queens long dust,"
2951,REFLECTIONS.,Me that can mourn no griefs
2952,REFLECTIONS.,But the tears in poets' rhymes?
2953,REFLECTIONS.,
2954,REFLECTIONS.,
2955,REFLECTIONS.,
2956,REFLECTIONS.,
2957,REFLECTIONS.,The Earth.
2958,REFLECTIONS.,
2959,REFLECTIONS.,
2960,REFLECTIONS.,"The Earth and her travail are ancient,"
2961,REFLECTIONS.,Her gods have but reigned for a while--
2962,REFLECTIONS.,"The moon-crowned Queen Astarte,"
2963,REFLECTIONS.,The barking god of the Nile.
2964,REFLECTIONS.,"Her temples were raised and builded,"
2965,REFLECTIONS.,And crumbled again to the dust--
2966,REFLECTIONS.,Her worships have been and vanished--
2967,REFLECTIONS.,But the heart of the Earth is just.

2969,REFLECTIONS.,

2971,REFLECTIONS.,
2972,REFLECTIONS.,Aspirations.
2973,REFLECTIONS.,
2974,REFLECTIONS.,
2975,REFLECTIONS.,For that Thou pointest further still
2976,REFLECTIONS.,Than that dumb hand upon the hour
2977,REFLECTIONS.,"Nor givest the boon to sap the will,"
2978,REFLECTIONS.,"I thank Thee, wise and tender power."
2979,REFLECTIONS.,
2980,REFLECTIONS.,"For that Thou givest my soul some pride,"
2981,REFLECTIONS.,"Not grudging sorrow for a mate,"
2982,REFLECTIONS.,For this my wild and lovely bride
2983,REFLECTIONS.,"I thank Thee, just, compassionate."
2984,REFLECTIONS.,
2985,REFLECTIONS.,For that Thou givest my soul some strength
2986,REFLECTIONS.,"Of that high strength which rules the stars,"
2987,REFLECTIONS.,"To brave the time and wait the length,"
2988,REFLECTIONS.,I bless Thy name and kiss my scars.

2994,REFLECTIONS.,
2995,REFLECTIONS.,
2996,REFLECTIONS.,Know the decree that natures such as mine
2997,REFLECTIONS.,"Must clasp the World and find her half-divine,"
2998,REFLECTIONS.,Hyperion-souls which need no anodyne.
2999,REFLECTIONS.,"Once more, once more ye come, ye lovely shapes,"
3000,REFLECTIONS.,"Voicing the magic ""Ye are Gods, not Apes."""
3001,REFLECTIONS.,And oh! the Glory over seas and capes.
3002,REFLECTIONS.,In memory only!--What that memory gave
3003,REFLECTIONS.,"Of our young day, so brief and yet so brave,"
3004,REFLECTIONS.,Will lead us half reluctant to the grave.
3005,REFLECTIONS.,Tho' it existed not--lived never--only came
3006,REFLECTIONS.,From some vast depth of dateless woe and shame
3007,REFLECTIONS.,"Striving to give its high desire a name,"
3008,REFLECTIONS.,The glory dies not; leaves us tired and still;
3009,REFLECTIONS.,"We cannot follow, even if we will;"
3010,REFLECTIONS.,The Afterglow! Ah! there--beyond the hill.
