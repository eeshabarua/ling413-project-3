147,(AFTER A. C. S.),New tune on the turn of their toes;
148,(AFTER A. C. S.),"Washed white from the stain of Astarte,"
149,(AFTER A. C. S.),My books any virgin may buy;
150,(AFTER A. C. S.),And I hear I am praised by a party

259,MARSYAS IN HADES.,
260,(AFTER SIR L. M.),(AFTER SIR L. M.)
261,(AFTER SIR L. M.),
262,(AFTER SIR L. M.),Next I saw
263,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"A pensive gentleman of middle age,"
264,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"That leaned against a Druid oak, his pipe"
265,(AFTER SIR L. M.),Pendent beneath his chin--a double one--
266,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"(Meaning the pipe); reluctant was his breath,"
267,(AFTER SIR L. M.),For he had mingled in the Morris dance
268,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"And rested blown; but damsels in their teens,"
269,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"All decorous and decorously clad,"
270,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"Their very ankles hardly visible,"
271,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"Recalled his motions; while, for chaperon,"
272,(AFTER SIR L. M.),Good Mrs. Grundy up against the wall
273,(AFTER SIR L. M.),Beamed approbation.
274,(AFTER SIR L. M.),
275,(AFTER SIR L. M.),On his face I read
276,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"Signs of high sadness such as poets wear,"
277,(AFTER SIR L. M.),Being divinely discontented with
278,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"The praise of _jeunes filles_. Even as I looked,"
279,(AFTER SIR L. M.),He touched the portion of his pipe reserved
280,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"For minor poetry of solemn tone,"
281,(AFTER SIR L. M.),Checking the humorous stops intended for
282,(AFTER SIR L. M.),Electioneering posters and the like;
283,(AFTER SIR L. M.),And therewithal he made the following
284,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"Addition to his _Songs Unsung_, or else"
285,(AFTER SIR L. M.),His _Unremarked Remarks_:
286,(AFTER SIR L. M.),
287,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"""Dear Sir,"" he said,"
288,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"""Excuse my saying 'Sir' like that; it is"
289,(AFTER SIR L. M.),Our way in Hades here among the damned;
290,(AFTER SIR L. M.),For you must know that some of us are damned
291,(AFTER SIR L. M.),Not only by faint praise but full applause
292,(AFTER SIR L. M.),Of simple critics. Take my case. In me
293,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"Behold the good knight Marsyas, M.A.,"
294,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"Three times a candidate for Parliament,"
295,(AFTER SIR L. M.),And twice retired; a Justice of the Peace;
296,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"Master of Arts (I said), and better known"
297,(AFTER SIR L. M.),In literary spheres as Master of
298,(AFTER SIR L. M.),The Mediocre-Obvious; and read
299,(AFTER SIR L. M.),By boarding-misses in their myriads.
300,(AFTER SIR L. M.),These dote upon me. Sweetly have I sung
301,(AFTER SIR L. M.),The commonplaces of philosophy
302,(AFTER SIR L. M.),In common parlance.
303,(AFTER SIR L. M.),
304,(AFTER SIR L. M.),You have read perhaps
305,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"The Cymric Triads? Poetry, they say,"
306,(AFTER SIR L. M.),Excels alone by sheer simplicity
307,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"Of language, subject, and invention. Sir!"
308,(AFTER SIR L. M.),The excellence of mine lay that way too.
309,(AFTER SIR L. M.),But fate is partial. Heaven's fulgour moulds
310,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"'To happiness some, some to unhappiness!'"
311,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"(Look you, the harp was Welsh that figured forth"
312,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"That excellent last line.) I ask you, Sir,"
313,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"What would you? Ill content with mortal praise,"
314,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"And haply somewhat overbold, I sought"
315,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"To be as gods be; sought, in fact, to filch"
316,(AFTER SIR L. M.),Apollo's bays!
317,(AFTER SIR L. M.),
318,(AFTER SIR L. M.),Ah me! Dear me! I fain
319,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"Would use a stronger phrase, but hardly dare,"
320,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"Being, whatever else, respectable."
321,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"I say I tired of vulgar homage, gift"
322,(AFTER SIR L. M.),Of ignorance. 'High failure overleaps
323,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"The bounds of low successes' (there, again,"
324,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"The harp that twanged was Welsh, but with an echo"
325,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"Of Browning). Godlike it must be, I thought,"
326,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"To climb the giddy brink; to pen, for instance,"
327,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"An Ode to the Imperial Institute,"
328,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"And fall, if bound to, from a decent height."
329,(AFTER SIR L. M.),
330,(AFTER SIR L. M.),I did and missed the laurel; still I go
331,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"On writing; what you hear just now is blank,"
332,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"Distinctly blank, and might be measured by"
333,(AFTER SIR L. M.),The kilomètre; yet I rhyme as well
334,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"A little; but it takes a lot of time,"
335,(AFTER SIR L. M.),And checks the lapse of my pellucid stream
336,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"Not all conveniently."""
337,(AFTER SIR L. M.),
338,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"Thereat he paused,"
339,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"And wrung the moisture from his pipe; but I,"
340,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"As one that was intolerably bored,"
341,(AFTER SIR L. M.),Took even this occasion to be gone;
342,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"And, going, marked him how he took his stile,"
343,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"Polished the waxen tablets, and began"
344,(AFTER SIR L. M.),"To make a Royal Pæan _by request_,"
345,(AFTER SIR L. M.),Or so he said.

358,(AFTER R. K.),And the rollicking sign of the _Lord Knows Who_
359,(AFTER R. K.),Sees mariners drink like sin;
360,(AFTER R. K.),Where the _Jolly Roger_ tips his quart
361,(AFTER R. K.),To the luck of the _Union Jack_;
362,(AFTER R. K.),"And some are screwed on the foreign port,"
363,(AFTER R. K.),And some on the starboard tack;--

366,(AFTER R. K.),How the smack _Tommy This_ and the smack _Tommy That_
367,(AFTER R. K.),"They broached each other like a whiskey-vat,"

369,(AFTER R. K.),
370,(AFTER R. K.),Now this is the law of the herring fleet that harries the northern
371,(AFTER R. K.),"main,"
372,(AFTER R. K.),Tattooed in scars on the chests of the tars with a brand like the
373,(AFTER R. K.),brand of Cain:
374,(AFTER R. K.),That none may woo the sea-born shrew save such as pay their way
375,(AFTER R. K.),With a kipperling netted at noon of night and cured ere the crack of
376,(AFTER R. K.),day.
377,(AFTER R. K.),
378,(AFTER R. K.),"It was the woman Sal o' the Dune, and the men were three to one,"
379,(AFTER R. K.),Bill the Skipper and Ned the Nipper and Sam that was Son of a Gun;
380,(AFTER R. K.),Bill was a Skipper and Ned was a Nipper and Sam was the Son of a
381,(AFTER R. K.),"Gun,"

383,(AFTER R. K.),to one.
384,(AFTER R. K.),
385,(AFTER R. K.),There was never a light in the sky that night of the soft midsummer
386,(AFTER R. K.),"gales,"
387,(AFTER R. K.),"But the great man-bloaters snorted low, and the young 'uns sang like"
388,(AFTER R. K.),whales;
389,(AFTER R. K.),And out laughed Sal (like a dog-toothed wheel was the laugh that Sal
390,(AFTER R. K.),laughed she):
391,(AFTER R. K.),"""Now who's for a bride on the shady side of up'ards of forty-three?"""
392,(AFTER R. K.),
393,(AFTER R. K.),"And Neddy he swore by butt and bend, and Billy by bend and bitt,"
394,(AFTER R. K.),And nautical names that no man frames but your amateur nautical
395,(AFTER R. K.),wit;
396,(AFTER R. K.),"And Sam said, ""Shiver my topping-lifts and scuttle my foc's'le"

399,(AFTER R. K.),"astarn!"""
400,(AFTER R. K.),
401,(AFTER R. K.),Now the smack _Tommy This_ and the smack _Tommy That_ and the
402,(AFTER R. K.),"_Fuzzy-Wuz_ smack, all three,"
403,(AFTER R. K.),"Their captains bold, they were Bill and Ned and Sam respectivelee."
404,(AFTER R. K.),
405,(AFTER R. K.),And it's writ in the rules that the primary schools of kippers
406,(AFTER R. K.),should get off cheap
407,(AFTER R. K.),For a two mile reach off Foulness beach when the July tide's at
408,(AFTER R. K.),neap;
409,(AFTER R. K.),And the lawless lubbers that lust for loot and filch the yearling
410,(AFTER R. K.),stock
411,(AFTER R. K.),They get smart raps from the coastguard chaps with their blunderbuss
412,(AFTER R. K.),fixed half-cock.
413,(AFTER R. K.),
414,(AFTER R. K.),Now Bill the Skipper and Ned the Nipper could tell green cheese from
415,(AFTER R. K.),"blue,"
416,(AFTER R. K.),"And Bill knew a trick and Ned knew a trick, but Sam knew a trick"
417,(AFTER R. K.),worth two.
418,(AFTER R. K.),
419,(AFTER R. K.),So Bill he sneaks a corporal's breeks and a belt of pipeclayed
420,(AFTER R. K.),"hide,"
421,(AFTER R. K.),And splices them on to the jibsail-boom like a troopship on the
422,(AFTER R. K.),tide.
423,(AFTER R. K.),
424,(AFTER R. K.),"And likewise Ned to his masthead he runs a rag of the Queen's,"
425,(AFTER R. K.),With a rusty sword and a moke on board to bray like the Horse
426,(AFTER R. K.),Marines.
427,(AFTER R. K.),
428,(AFTER R. K.),But Sam sniffs gore and he keeps off-shore and he waits for things
429,(AFTER R. K.),"to stir,"
430,(AFTER R. K.),Then he tracks for the deep with a long fog-horn rigged up like a
431,(AFTER R. K.),bowchasér.
432,(AFTER R. K.),
433,(AFTER R. K.),Now scarce had Ned dropped line and lead when he spots the
434,(AFTER R. K.),"pipeclayed hide,"
435,(AFTER R. K.),And the corporal's breeks on the jibsail-boom like a troopship on
436,(AFTER R. K.),the tide;
437,(AFTER R. K.),"And Bill likewise, when he ups and spies the slip of a rag of the"
438,(AFTER R. K.),"Queen's,"
439,(AFTER R. K.),"And the rusty sword, and he sniffs aboard the moke of the Horse"
440,(AFTER R. K.),Marines.
441,(AFTER R. K.),
442,(AFTER R. K.),"So they each luffed sail, and they each turned tail, and they"
443,(AFTER R. K.),"whipped their wheels like mad,"
444,(AFTER R. K.),"When the one he said ""By the Lord, it's Ned!"" and the other, ""It's"
445,(AFTER R. K.),"Bill, by Gad!"""
446,(AFTER R. K.),
447,(AFTER R. K.),"Then about and about, and nozzle to snout, they rammed through"
448,(AFTER R. K.),"breach and brace,"
449,(AFTER R. K.),And the splinters flew as they mostly do when a Government test
450,(AFTER R. K.),takes place.
451,(AFTER R. K.),
452,(AFTER R. K.),Then up stole Sam with his little ram and the nautical talk flowed
453,(AFTER R. K.),"free,"
454,(AFTER R. K.),And in good bold type might have covered the two front sheets of the
455,_P. M. G._,_P. M. G._
456,_P. M. G._,
457,_P. M. G._,"But the fog-horn bluff was safe enough, where all was weed and"

460,_P. M. G._,left

464,_P. M. G._,Francis Drake.
465,_P. M. G._,
466,_P. M. G._,So Sam he hauls the dead men's trawls and he booms for the

1906,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,"""It is certainly remarkable, in our dearth of great poetry, how good"
1907,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,"of its sort the satiric verse of our day is--so good, in fact, that"
1908,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,"nothing but the best will serve, and even the best, like Mr. Seaman's,"
1909,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,which in the day when Sir George Trevelyan was a wit would have taken
1910,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,"people's breath away, is apt to be treated as mere journalism.... But"
1911,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,"really it is the most characteristic expression of our time, using the"
1912,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,accustomed forms of verse to point the neatest criticisms and the
1913,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,slyest of epigrams.... Mr. Seaman's humourous imitation of Mr.
1914,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,"Swinburne, Sir Edwin Arnold, Sir Lewis Morris, Mr. Kipling, and the"
1915,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,"rest, is in every case very funny.""--_St. James's Gazette_."
1916,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,
1917,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,"""The book abounds in excellent fooling and really wholesome satire,"
1918,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,the ingenuity and felicity of verse and expression giving it likewise
1919,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,"a high artistic value.... Quips and cranks of audacious wit, strokes"
1920,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,"of a humour always sane and healthy, waylay the reader incessantly,"
1921,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,"and leave him no peace for laughter.""--_The Westminster Gazette_."
1922,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,
1923,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,"""Mr. Seaman must be tired of being compared to Calverley and J. K. S.,"
1924,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,"but he is of their company, and, what is more, on their level. 'The"
1925,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,"Battle of the Bays' ... bristles with points; it is brilliant, ... and"
1926,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,it has that easy conversational flow which is the one absolutely
1927,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,necessary characteristic of good humourous poetry.... One charm of
1928,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,writing such as Mr. Seaman's is that it makes us feel quite obliged to
1929,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,"poets whom we have never admired for being so good to parody.""--_Pall"
1930,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,Mall Gazette_.
1931,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,
1932,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,"""Mr. Owen Seaman has a very neat talent for parody.... The 'Ballad of"
1933,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,"a Bun' is exceedingly funny, and ought to make even Mr. John Davidson"
1934,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,"laugh.... All the imitations are good.""--_The Times_."
1935,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,
1936,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,"""His versatility and bright and ready wit are conspicuous in all his"
1937,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,"work. As a parodist he is second to none, not even to Mr. Calverley,"
1938,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,if we may take the word of the reviewers.... Mr. Seaman cracks the
1939,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,"whip with consummate skill, and applies it with such naughty"
1940,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,"precision, that even his victims must find it difficult to withhold"
1941,SOME PRESS OPINIONS.,"their admiration.""--_The National Observer_."
