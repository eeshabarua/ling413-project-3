88,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Publisher's Note
89,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
90,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,The present volume is made up of poems from Mr. Carman's three latest
91,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"books, _The Rough Rider_, _Echoes from Vagabondia_, and _April Airs_,"
92,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,together with a number of more recent poems which have not before been
93,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,issued in book form.

98,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Bliss Carman: An Appreciation
99,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
100,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,How many Canadians--how many even among the few who seek to keep
101,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"themselves informed of the best in contemporary literature, who are"
102,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"ever on the alert for the new voices--realise, or even suspect, that"
103,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,this Northern land of theirs has produced a poet of whom it may be
104,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,affirmed with confidence and assurance that he is of the great
105,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,succession of English poets?  Yet such--strange and unbelievable though
106,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"it may seem--is in very truth the case, that poet being (to give him"
107,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,his full name) William Bliss Carman.  Canada has full right to be proud
108,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"of her poets, a small body though they are; but not only does Mr."
109,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Carman stand high and clear above them all--his place (and time cannot
110,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,but confirm and justify the assertion) is among those men whose poetry
111,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,is the shining glory of that great English literature which is our
112,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,common heritage.
113,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
114,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"If any should ask why, if what has been just said is so, there has"
115,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,been--as must be admitted--no general recognition of the fact in the
116,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"poet's home land, I would answer that there are various and plausible,"
117,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"if not good, reasons for it."
118,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
119,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"First of all, the poet, as thousands more of our young men of ambition"
120,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"and confidence have done, went early to the United States, and until"
121,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"recently, except for rare and brief visits to his old home down by the"
122,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"sea, has never returned to Canada--though for all that, I am able to"
123,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"state, on his own authority, he is still a Canadian citizen.  Then all"
124,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"his books have had their original publication in the United States, and"
125,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,while a few of them have subsequently carried the imprints of Canadian
126,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"publishers, none of these can be said ever to have made any special"
127,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,effort to push their sale.  Another reason for the fact above mentioned
128,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"is that Mr. Carman has always scorned to advertise himself, while his"
129,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,work has never been the subject of the log-rolling and booming which
130,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,the work of many another poet has had--to his ultimate loss.  A further
131,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,reason is that he follows a rule of his own in preparing his books for
132,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"publication.  Most poets publish a volume of their work as soon as,"
133,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"through their industry and perseverance, they have material enough on"
134,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,hand to make publication desirable in their eyes.  Not so with Mr.
135,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Carman, however, his rule being not to publish until he has done"
136,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,sufficient work of a certain general character or key to make a volume.
137,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"As a result, you cannot fully know or estimate his work by one book, or"
138,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"two books, or even half a dozen; you must possess or be familiar with"
139,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,every one of the score and more volumes which contain his output of
140,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,poetry before you can realise how great and how many-sided is his
141,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,genius.
142,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
143,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,It is a common remark on the part of those who respond readily to the
144,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"vigorous work of Kipling, or Masefield, even our own Service, that"
145,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Bliss Carman's poetry has no relation to or concern with ordinary,"
146,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,everyday life.  One would suppose that most persons who cared for
147,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,poetry at all turned to it as a relief from or counter to the burdens
148,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"and vexations of the daily round; but in any event, the remark referred"
149,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,to seems to me to indicate either the most casual acquaintance with Mr.
150,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Carman's work, or a complete misunderstanding and misapprehension of"
151,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,the meaning of it.  I grant that you will find little or nothing in it
152,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,all to remind you of the grim realities and vexing social problems of
153,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,this modern existence of ours; but to say or to suggest that these
154,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,things do not exist for Mr. Carman is to say or to suggest something
155,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"which is the reverse of true.  The truth is, he is aware of them as"
156,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,only one with the sensitive organism of a poet can be; but he does not
157,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"feel that he has a call or mission to remedy them, and still less to"
158,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,sing of them.  He therefore leaves the immediate problems of the day to
159,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"those who choose, or are led, to occupy themselves therewith, and turns"
160,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,resolutely away to dwell upon those things which for him possess
161,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,infinitely greater importance.
162,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
163,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"""What are they?"" one who knows Mr. Carman only as, say, a lyrist of"
164,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,spring or as a singer of the delights of vagabondia probably will ask
165,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"in some wonder.  Well, the things which concern him above all, I would"
166,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"answer, are first, and naturally, the beauty and wonder of this world"
167,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"of ours, and next the mystery of the earthly pilgrimage of the human"
168,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,soul out of eternity and back into it again.
169,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
170,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"The poems in the present volume--which, by the way, can boast the high"
171,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,honor of being the very first regular Canadian edition of his
172,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"work--will be evidence ample and conclusive to every reader, I am sure,"
173,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,of the place which
174,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
175,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,The perennial enchanted
176,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Lovely world and all its lore
177,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
178,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"occupy in the heart and soul of Bliss Carman, as well as of the magical"
179,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,power with which he is able to convey the deep and unfailing
180,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"satisfaction and delight which they possess for him.  They, however,"
181,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"represent his latest period (he has had three well-defined periods),"
182,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,comprising selections from three of his last published volumes: _The
183,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Rough Rider_, _Echoes from Vagabondia_, and _April Airs_, together with"
184,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"a number of new poems, and do not show, except here and there and by"
185,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"hints and flashes, how great is his preoccupation with the problem of"
186,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,man's existence--
187,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
188,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,the hidden import
189,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Of man's eternal plight.
190,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
191,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
192,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"This is manifest most in certain of his earlier books, for in these he"
193,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,turns and returns to the greatest of all the problems of man almost
194,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"constantly, probing, with consummate and almost unrivalled use of the"
195,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"art of expression, for the secret which surely, he clearly feels, lies"
196,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"hidden somewhere, to be discovered if one could but pierce deeply"
197,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"enough.  Pick up _Behind the Arras_, and as you turn over page after"
198,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,page you cannot but observe how incessantly the poet's mind--like the
199,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"minds of his two great masters, Browning and Whitman--works at this"
200,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"problem.  In ""Behind the Arras,"" the title poem; ""In the Wings,"" ""The"
201,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Crimson House,"" ""The Lodger,"" ""Beyond the Gamut,"" ""The Juggler""--yes,"
202,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,in every poem in the book--he takes up and handles the strange thing we
203,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"know as, or call, life, turning it now this way, now that, in an effort"
204,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,to find out its meaning and purpose.  He comes but little nearer
205,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"success in this than do most of the rest of men, of course; but the"
206,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"magical and ever-fresh beauty of his expression, the haunting melody of"
207,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"his lines, the variety of his images and figures and the depth and"
208,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"range of his thought, put his searchings and ponderings in a class by"
209,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,themselves.
210,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
211,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Lengthy quotation from Mr. Carman's books is not permitted here, and I"
212,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"must guide myself accordingly, though with reluctance, because I"
213,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,believe that in a study such as this the subject should be allowed to
214,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"speak for himself as much as possible.  In ""Behind the Arras"" the poet"
215,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,describes the passage from life to death as
216,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
217,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,A cadence dying down unto its source
218,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"In music's course,"
219,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
220,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,and goes on to speak of death as
221,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
222,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"the broken rhythm of thought and man,"
223,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,The sweep and span
224,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Of memory and hope
225,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,About the orbit where they still must grope
226,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"For wider scope,"
227,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
228,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"To be through thousand springs restored, renewed,"
229,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"With love imbrued,"
230,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,With increments of will
231,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Made strong, perceiving unattainment still"
232,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,From each new skill.
233,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
234,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
235,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Now follow some verses from ""Behind the Gamut,"" to my mind the poet's"
236,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,greatest single achievement;
237,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
238,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"As fine sand spread on a disc of silver,"
239,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"At some chord which bids the motes combine,"
240,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Heeding the hidden and reverberant impulse,"
241,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Shifts and dances into curve and line,"
242,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
243,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"The round earth, too, haply, like a dust-mote,"
244,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Was set whirling her assigned sure way,"
245,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Round this little orb of her ecliptic
246,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,To some harmony she must obey.
247,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
248,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,And what of man?
249,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
250,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Linked to all his half-accomplished fellows,"
251,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Through unfrontiered provinces to range--
252,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Man is but the morning dream of nature,"
253,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Roused to some wild cadence weird and strange.
254,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
255,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
256,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Here, now, are some verses from ""Pulvis et Umbra,"" which is to be found"
257,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"in Mr. Carman's first book, _Low Tide on Grand Pré_, and in which the"
258,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,poet addresses a moth which a storm has blown into his window:
259,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
260,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,For man walks the world with mourning
261,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Down to death and leaves no trace,"
262,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"With the dust upon his forehead,"
263,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,And the shadow on his face.
264,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
265,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Pillared dust and fleeing shadow
266,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"As the roadside wind goes by,"
267,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,And the fourscore years that vanish
268,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,In the twinkling of an eye.
269,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
270,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
271,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"""Pillared dust and fleeing shadow.""  Where in all our English"
272,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,literature will one find the life history of man summed up more briefly
273,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"and, at the same time, more beautifully, than in that wonderful line?"
274,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Now follows a companion verse to those just quoted, taken from ""Lord of"
275,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"My Heart's Elation,"" which stands in the forefront of _From the Green"
276,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Book of the Bards_.  It may be remarked here that while the poet recurs
277,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"again and again to some favorite thought or idea, it is never in the"
278,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"same words.  His expression is always new and fresh, showing how deep"
279,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,and true is his inspiration.  Again it is man who is pictured:
280,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
281,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,A fleet and shadowy column
282,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Of dust and mountain rain,"
283,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,To walk the earth a moment
284,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,And be dissolved again.
285,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
286,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
287,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,But while Mr. Carman's speculations upon life's meaning and the mystery
288,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"of the future cannot but appeal to the thoughtful-minded, it is as an"
289,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"interpreter of nature that he makes his widest appeal.  Bliss Carman, I"
290,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"must say here, and emphatically, is no mere landscape-painter; he"
291,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"never, or scarcely ever, paints a picture of nature for its own sake."
292,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,He goes beyond the outward aspect of things and interprets or
293,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,translates for us with less keen senses as only a poet whose feeling
294,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"for nature is of the deepest and profoundest, who has gone to her"
295,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"whole-heartedly and been taken close to her warm bosom, can do.  Is"
296,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"this not evident from these verses from ""The Great Return""--originally"
297,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"called ""The Pagan's Prayer,"" and for some inscrutable reason to be"
298,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"found only in the limited _Collected Poems_, issued in two stately"
299,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,volumes in 1905 (1904)?
300,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
301,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"When I have lifted up my heart to thee,"
302,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Thou hast ever hearkened and drawn near,"
303,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"And bowed thy shining face close over me,"
304,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Till I could hear thee as the hill-flowers hear.
305,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
306,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"When I have cried to thee in lonely need,"
307,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Being but a child of thine bereft and wrung,"
308,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Then all the rivers in the hills gave heed;
309,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,And the great hill-winds in thy holy tongue--
310,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
311,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,That ancient incommunicable speech--
312,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,The April stars and autumn sunsets know--
313,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Soothed me and calmed with solace beyond reach
314,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Of human ken, mysterious and low."
315,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
316,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
317,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Who can read or listen to those moving lines without feeling that Mr.
318,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Carman is in very truth a poet of nature--nay, Nature's own poet?  But"
319,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"how could he be other when, in ""The Breath of the Reed"" (_From the"
320,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Green Book of the Bards_), he makes the appeal?"
321,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
322,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Make me thy priest, O Mother,"
323,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"And prophet of thy mood,"
324,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,With all the forest wonder
325,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Enraptured and imbued.
326,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
327,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
328,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"As becomes such a poet, and particularly a poet whose birth-month is"
329,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"April, Mr. Carman sings much of the early spring.  Again and again he"
330,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"takes up his woodland pipe, and lo! Pan himself and all his train troop"
331,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,joyously before us.  Yet the singer's notes for all his singing never
332,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,become wearied or strident; his airs are ever new and fresh; his latest
333,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"songs are no less spontaneous and winning than were his first, written"
334,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"how many years ago, while at the same time they have gained in beauty"
335,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,and melody.  What heart will not stir to the vibrant music of his
336,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"immortal ""Spring Song,"" which was originally published in the first"
337,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"_Songs from Vagabondia_, and the opening verses of which follow?"
338,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
339,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Make me over, mother April,"
340,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,When the sap begins to stir!
341,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,When thy flowery hand delivers
342,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"All the mountain-prisoned rivers,"
343,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,And thy great heart beats and quivers
344,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"To revive the days that were,"
345,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Make me over, mother April,"
346,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,When the sap begins to stir!
347,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
348,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Take my dust and all my dreaming,"
349,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Count my heart-beats one by one,"
350,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Send them where the winters perish;
351,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Then some golden noon recherish
352,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"And restore them in the sun,"
353,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Flower and scent and dust and dreaming,"
354,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,With their heart-beats every one!
355,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
356,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
357,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,That poem is sufficient in itself to prove that Bliss Carman has full
358,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"right and title to be called Spring's own lyrist, though it may be"
359,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,remarked here that not all his spring poems are so unfeignedly joyous.
360,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Many of them indeed, have a touch, or more than a touch, of"
361,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"wistfulness, for the poet knows well that sorrow lurks under all joy,"
362,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,deep and well hidden though it may be.
363,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
364,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Mr. Carman sings equally finely, though perhaps not so frequently, of"
365,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,summer and the other seasons; but as he has other claims upon our
366,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"attention, I shall forbear to labor the fact, particularly as the"
367,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,following collection demonstrates it sufficiently.  One of those other
368,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"claims is as a writer of sea poetry.  Few poets, it may be said, have"
369,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"pictured the majesty and the mystery, the beauty and the terror of the"
370,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"sea, better than he.  His _Ballads of Lost Haven_ is a veritable"
371,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,treasure-house for those whose spirits find kinship in wide expanses of
372,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"moving waters.  One of the best known poems in this volume is ""The"
373,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Gravedigger,"" which opens thus:"
374,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
375,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Oh, the shambling sea is a sexton old,"
376,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,And well his work is done.
377,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"With an equal grave for lord and knave,"
378,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,He buries them every one.
379,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
380,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Then hoy and rip, with a rolling hip,"
381,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,He makes for the nearest shore;
382,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"And God, who sent him a thousand ship,"
383,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Will send him a thousand more;
384,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"But some he'll save for a bleaching grave,"
385,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,And shoulder them in to shore--
386,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Shoulder them in, shoulder them in,"
387,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Shoulder them in to shore.
388,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
389,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
390,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"In ""The City of the Sea"" (_Last Songs from Vagabondia_) Mr. Carman"
391,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,speaks of the seabells sounding
392,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
393,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,The eternal cadence of sea sorrow
394,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,For Man's lot and immemorial wrong--
395,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,The lost strains that haunt the human dwelling
396,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,With the ghost of song.
397,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
398,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
399,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Elsewhere he speaks of
400,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
401,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"The great sea, mystic and musical."
402,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
403,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,And here from another poem is a striking picture:
404,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
405,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,... the old sea
406,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Seems to whimper and deplore
407,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Mourning like a childless crone
408,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,With her sorrow left alone--
409,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,The eternal human cry
410,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,To the heedless passer-by.
411,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
412,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
413,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"I have said above that Mr. Carman has had three distinct periods, and"
414,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,intimated that the poems in the following collection are of his third
415,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,period.  The first period may be said to be represented by the _Low
416,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Tide_ and _Behind the Arras_ volumes, while the second is displayed in"
417,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"the three volumes of _Songs from Vagabondia_, which he published in"
418,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,association with his friend Richard Hovey.  Bliss Carman was from the
419,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,first too original and individual a poet to be directly influenced by
420,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,anyone else; but there can be no doubt that his friendship with Hovey
421,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"helped to turn him from over-preoccupation with mysteries which, for"
422,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"all their greatness, are not for man to solve, to an intenser"
423,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,realisation of the beauty and loveliness of the world about him and of
424,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,the joys of human fellowship.  The result is seen in such poems as
425,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"""Spring Song,"" quoted in part above, and his perhaps equally well-known"
426,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"""The Joys of the Road,"" which appeared in the same volume with that"
427,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"poem, and a few verses from which follow:"
428,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
429,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Now the joys of the road are chiefly these:
430,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,A crimson touch on the hardwood trees;
431,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
432,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"A vagrant's morning wide and blue,"
433,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"In early fall, when the wind walks, too;"
434,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
435,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"A shadowy highway cool and brown,"
436,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Alluring up and enticing down
437,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
438,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"From rippled waters and dappled swamp,"
439,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,From purple glory to scarlet pomp;
440,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
441,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"The outward eye, the quiet will,"
442,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,And the striding heart from hill to hill.
443,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
444,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
445,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Some of the finest of Mr. Carman's work is contained in his elegiac or
446,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"memorial poems, in which he commemorates Keats, Shelley, William Blake,"
447,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Lincoln, Stevenson, and other men for whom he has a kindred feeling,"
448,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,and also friends whom he has loved and lost.  Listen to these moving
449,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"lines from ""Non Omnis Moriar,"" written in memory of Gleeson White, and"
450,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,to be found in _Last Songs from Vagabondia_:
451,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
452,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"There is a part of me that knows,"
453,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Beneath incertitude and fear,"
454,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,I shall not perish when I pass
455,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Beyond mortality's frontier;
456,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
457,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"But greatly having joyed and grieved,"
458,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Greatly content, shall hear the sigh"
459,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Of the strange wind across the lone
460,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Bright lands of taciturnity.
461,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
462,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,In patience therefore I await
463,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"My friend's unchanged benign regard,--"
464,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Some April when I too shall be
465,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Spilt water from a broken shard.
466,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
467,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
468,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"In ""The White Gull,"" written for the centenary of the birth of Shelley"
469,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"in 1892, and included in _By the Aurelian Wall_, he thus apostrophizes"
470,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,that clear and shining spirit:
471,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
472,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"O captain of the rebel host,"
473,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Lead forth and far!
474,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Thy toiling troopers of the night
475,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Press on the unavailing fight;
476,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"The sombre field is not yet lost,"
477,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,With thee for star.
478,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
479,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Thy lips have set the hail and haste
480,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Of clarions free
481,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,To bugle down the wintry verge
482,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Of time forever, where the surge"
483,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Thunders and trembles on a waste
484,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,And open sea.
485,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
486,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
487,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"In ""A Seamark,"" a threnody for Robert Louis Stevenson, which appears in"
488,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"the same volume, the poet hails ""R.L.S."" (of whose tribe he may be said"
489,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,to be truly one) as
490,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
491,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"The master of the roving kind,"
492,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
493,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,and goes on:
494,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
495,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,O all you hearts about the world
496,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"In whom the truant gypsy blood,"
497,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Under the frost of this pale time,"
498,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Sleeps like the daring sap and flood
499,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,That dreams of April and reprieve!
500,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"You whom the haunted vision drives,"
501,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Incredulous of home and ease.
502,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Perfection's lovers all your lives!
503,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
504,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,You whom the wander-spirit loves
505,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,To lead by some forgotten clue
506,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Forever vanishing beyond
507,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Horizon brinks forever new;
508,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Our restless loved adventurer,"
509,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"On secret orders come to him,"
510,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Has slipped his cable, cleared the reef,"
511,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,And melted on the white sea-rim.
512,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
513,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
514,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"""Perfection's lovers all your lives.""  Of these, it may be said without"
515,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"qualification, is Bliss Carman himself."
516,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
517,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"No summary of Mr. Carman's work, however cursory, would be worthy of"
518,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,the name if it omitted mention of his ventures in the realm of Greek
519,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"myth.  _From the Book of Myths_ is made up of work of that sort, every"
520,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,poem in it being full of the beauty of phrase and melody of which Mr.
521,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Carman alone has the secret.  The finest poems in the book, barring the"
522,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"opening one, ""Overlord,"" are ""Daphne,"" ""The Dead Faun,"" ""Hylas,"" and"
523,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"""At Phædra's Tomb,"" but I can do no more here than name them, for"
524,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"extracts would fail to reveal their full beauty.  And beauty, after all"
525,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"is said, is the first and last thing with Mr. Carman.  As he says"
526,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,himself somewhere:
527,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
528,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,The joy of the hand that hews for beauty
529,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Is the dearest solace under the sun.
530,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
531,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,And again
532,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
533,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,The eternal slaves of beauty
534,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Are the masters of the world.
535,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
536,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"A slave--a happy, willing slave--to beauty is the poet himself, and the"
537,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,world can never repay him for the message of beauty which he has
538,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,brought it.
539,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
540,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Kindred to _From the Book of Myths_, but much more important, is"
541,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"_Sappho: One Hundred Lyrics_, one of the most successful of the"
542,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,numerous attempts which have been made to recapture the poems by that
543,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,high priestess of song which remain to us only in fragments.  Mr.
544,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Carman, as Charles G. D. Roberts points out in an introduction to the"
545,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"volume, has made no attempt here at translation or paraphrasing; his"
546,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"venture has been ""the most perilous and most alluring in the whole"
547,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"field of poetry""--that of imaginative and, at the same time,"
548,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,interpretive construction.  Brief quotation again would fail to convey
549,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"an adequate idea of the exquisiteness of the work, and all I can do,"
550,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"therefore, is to urge all lovers of real poetry to possess themselves"
551,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"of _Sappho: One Hundred Lyrics_, for it is literally a storehouse of"
552,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,lyric beauty.
553,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
554,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"I must not fail here to speak of _From the Book of Valentines_, which"
555,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"contains some lovely things, notably ""At the Great Release.""  This is"
556,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"not only one of the finest of all Mr. Carman's poems, but it is also"
557,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"one of the finest poems of our time.  It is a love poem, and no one"
558,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,possessing any real feeling for poetry can read it without experiencing
559,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,that strange thrill of the spirit which only the highest form of poetry
560,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"can communicate.  ""Morning and Evening,"" ""In an Iris Meadow,"" and ""A"
561,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"letter from Lesbos"" must be also mentioned.  In the last named poem,"
562,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Sappho is represented as writing to Gorgo, and expresses herself in"
563,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,these moving words:
564,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
565,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,If the high gods in that triumphant time
566,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Have calendared no day for thee to come
567,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Light-hearted to this doorway as of old,"
568,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Unmoved I shall behold their pomps go by--
569,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"The painted seasons in their pageantry,"
570,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"The silvery progressions of the moon,"
571,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"And all their infinite ardors unsubdued,"
572,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Pass with the wind replenishing the earth
573,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
574,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Incredulous forever I must live
575,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"And, once thy lover, without joy behold,"
576,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"The gradual uncounted years go by,"
577,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Sharing the bitterness of all things made.
578,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
579,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
580,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Mention must be now made of _Songs of the Sea Children_, which can be"
581,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,described only as a collection of the sweetest and tenderest love
582,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,lyrics written in our time--
583,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
584,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,the lyric songs
585,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"The earthborn children sing,"
586,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,When wild-wood laughter throngs
587,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,The shy bird-throats of spring;
588,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,When there's not a joy of the heart
589,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"But flies like a flag unfurled,"
590,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,And the swelling buds bring back
591,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,The April of the world.
592,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
593,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
594,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,So perfect and complete are these lyrics that it would be almost
595,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"sacrilege to quote any of them unless entire.  Listen however, to these"
596,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,verses:
597,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
598,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"The day is lost without thee,"
599,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,The night has not a star.
600,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Thy going is an empty room
601,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Whose door is left ajar.
602,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
603,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Depart: it is the footfall
604,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Of twilight on the hills.
605,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Return: and every rood of ground
606,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Breaks into daffodils.
607,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
608,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
609,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,There are those who will have it that Bliss Carman has been away from
610,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Canada so long that he has ceased to be, in a real sense, a Canadian."
611,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Such assume rather than know, for a very little study of his work would"
612,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,show them that it is shot through and through with the poet's feeling
613,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,for the land of his birth.  Memories of his childhood and youthful
614,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"years down by the sea are still fresh in Mr. Carman's mind, and inspire"
615,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"him again and again in his writing.  ""A Remembrance,"" at the beginning"
616,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"of the present collection, may be pointed to as a striking instance of"
617,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"this, but proof positive is the volume, _Songs from a Northern Garden_,"
618,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"for it could have been written only by a Canadian, born and bred, one"
619,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,whose heart and soul thrill to the thought of Canada.  I would single
620,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"out from this volume for special mention as being ""Canadian"" in the"
621,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"fullest sense ""In a Grand Pré Garden,"" ""The Keeper's Silence,"" ""At Home"
622,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"and Abroad,"" ""Killoleet,"" and ""Above the Gaspereau,"" but have no space"
623,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,to quote from them.
624,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
625,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"But Mr. Carman is not only a Canadian, he is also a Briton; and"
626,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"evidence of this is his _Ode on the Coronation_, written on the"
627,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,occasion of the crowning of King Edward VII in 1902.  This poem--the
628,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,very existence of which is hardly known among us--ought to be put in
629,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"the hands of every child and youth who speaks the English tongue, for"
630,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"no other, I dare maintain--nothing by Kipling, or Newbolt, or any other"
631,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"of our so-called ""Imperial singers""--expresses more truly and more"
632,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,movingly the deep feeling of love and reverence which the very thought
633,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"of England evokes in every son of hers, even though it may never have"
634,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,been his to see her white cliffs rise or to tread her storied ground:
635,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
636,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"O England, little mother by the sleepless Northern tide,"
637,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Having bred so many nations to devotion, trust, and pride,"
638,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Very tenderly we turn
639,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,With welling hearts that yearn
640,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Still to love you and defend you,--let the sons of men discern"
641,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Wherein your right and title, might and majesty, reside."
642,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
643,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
644,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"In concluding this, I greatly fear, lamentably inadequate study, I come"
645,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"to the collection which follows, and which, as intimated above,"
646,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,represents the work of Mr. Carman's latest period.  I must say at once
647,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"that, while I yield to no one in admiration for _Low Tide_ and the"
648,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"other books of that period, or for the work of the second period, as"
649,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"represented by the _Songs from Vagabondia_ volumes, I have no"
650,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,hesitation in declaring that I regard the poet's work of the past few
651,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,years with even higher admiration.  It may not possess the force and
652,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,vigor of the work which preceded it; but anything seemingly missing in
653,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,that respect is more than made up for me by increased beauty and
654,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"clarity of expression.  The mysticism--verging, or more than verging,"
655,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"at times on symbolism--which marked his earlier poems, and which hung,"
656,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"as it were, as a veil between them and the reader, has gone, and the"
657,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,poet's thought or theme now lies clearly before us as in a mirror.
658,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,What--to take a verse from the following pages at random--could be more
659,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"pellucid, more crystal clear in expression--what indeed, could come"
660,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,closer to that achieving of the impossible at which every real poet
661,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"must aim--than this from ""In Gold Lacquer"" (page 12)?"
662,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
663,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Gold are the great trees overhead,"
664,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"And gold the leaf-strewn grass,"
665,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,As though a cloth of gold were spread
666,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,To let a seraph pass.
667,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"And where the pageant should go by,"
668,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Meadow and wood and stream,"
669,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"The world is all of lacquered gold,"
670,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Expectant as a dream.
671,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
672,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,
673,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"The poet, happily, has fully recovered from the serious illness which"
674,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"laid him low some two years ago, and which for a time caused his"
675,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"friends and admirers the gravest concern, and so we may look forward"
676,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,hopefully to seeing further volumes of verse come from the press to
677,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"make certain his name and fame.  But if, for any reason, this should"
678,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"not be--which the gods forfend!--_Later Poems_, I dare affirm, must and"
679,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,will be regarded as the fine flower and crowning achievement of the
680,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,genius and art of Bliss Carman.

877,THE GATE OF PEACE,
878,THE GATE OF PEACE,"_I took a day to search for God,"
879,THE GATE OF PEACE,And found Him not.  But as I trod
880,THE GATE OF PEACE,"By rocky ledge, through woods untamed,"
881,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Just where one scarlet lily flamed,"
882,THE GATE OF PEACE,I saw His footprint in the sod._
883,THE GATE OF PEACE,
884,THE GATE OF PEACE,"_Then suddenly, all unaware,"
885,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Far off in the deep shadows, where"
886,THE GATE OF PEACE,A solitary hermit thrush
887,THE GATE OF PEACE,Sang through the holy twilight hush--
888,THE GATE OF PEACE,I heard His voice upon the air._
889,THE GATE OF PEACE,
890,THE GATE OF PEACE,_And even as I marvelled how
891,THE GATE OF PEACE,"God gives us Heaven here and now,"
892,THE GATE OF PEACE,In a stir of wind that hardly shook
893,THE GATE OF PEACE,The poplar leaves beside the brook--
894,THE GATE OF PEACE,His hand was light upon my brow._
895,THE GATE OF PEACE,
896,THE GATE OF PEACE,_At last with evening as I turned
897,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Homeward, and thought what I had learned"
898,THE GATE OF PEACE,And all that there was still to probe--
899,THE GATE OF PEACE,I caught the glory of His robe
900,THE GATE OF PEACE,Where the last fires of sunset burned._
901,THE GATE OF PEACE,
902,THE GATE OF PEACE,_Back to the world with quickening start
903,THE GATE OF PEACE,I looked and longed for any part
904,THE GATE OF PEACE,In making saving Beauty be....
905,THE GATE OF PEACE,And from that kindling ecstasy
906,THE GATE OF PEACE,I knew God dwelt within my heart._
907,THE GATE OF PEACE,
908,THE GATE OF PEACE,
909,THE GATE OF PEACE,
910,THE GATE OF PEACE,
911,THE GATE OF PEACE,A Remembrance.
912,THE GATE OF PEACE,
913,THE GATE OF PEACE,Here in lovely New England
914,THE GATE OF PEACE,"When summer is come, a sea-turn"
915,THE GATE OF PEACE,Flutters a page of remembrance
916,THE GATE OF PEACE,In the volume of long ago.
917,THE GATE OF PEACE,
918,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Soft is the wind over Grand Pré,"
919,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Stirring the heads of the grasses,"
920,THE GATE OF PEACE,Sweet is the breath of the orchards
921,THE GATE OF PEACE,White with their apple-blow.
922,THE GATE OF PEACE,
923,THE GATE OF PEACE,There at their infinite business
924,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Of measuring time forever,"
925,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Murmuring songs of the sea,"
926,THE GATE OF PEACE,The great tides come and go.
927,THE GATE OF PEACE,
928,THE GATE OF PEACE,Over the dikes and the uplands
929,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Wander the great cloud shadows,"
930,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Strange as the passing of sorrow,"
931,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Beautiful, solemn, and slow."
932,THE GATE OF PEACE,
933,THE GATE OF PEACE,"For, spreading her old enchantment"
934,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Of tender ineffable wonder,"
935,THE GATE OF PEACE,Summer is there in the Northland!
936,THE GATE OF PEACE,How should my heart not know?
937,THE GATE OF PEACE,
938,THE GATE OF PEACE,
939,THE GATE OF PEACE,
940,THE GATE OF PEACE,
941,THE GATE OF PEACE,The Ships of Yule
942,THE GATE OF PEACE,
943,THE GATE OF PEACE,"When I was just a little boy,"
944,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Before I went to school,"
945,THE GATE OF PEACE,I had a fleet of forty sail
946,THE GATE OF PEACE,I called the Ships of Yule;
947,THE GATE OF PEACE,
948,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Of every rig, from rakish brig"
949,THE GATE OF PEACE,"And gallant barkentine,"
950,THE GATE OF PEACE,To little Fundy fishing boats
951,THE GATE OF PEACE,With gunwales painted green.
952,THE GATE OF PEACE,
953,THE GATE OF PEACE,They used to go on trading trips
954,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Around the world for me,"
955,THE GATE OF PEACE,For though I had to stay on shore
956,THE GATE OF PEACE,My heart was on the sea.
957,THE GATE OF PEACE,
958,THE GATE OF PEACE,They stopped at every port to call
959,THE GATE OF PEACE,"From Babylon to Rome,"
960,THE GATE OF PEACE,To load with all the lovely things
961,THE GATE OF PEACE,We never had at home;
962,THE GATE OF PEACE,
963,THE GATE OF PEACE,With elephants and ivory
964,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Bought from the King of Tyre,"
965,THE GATE OF PEACE,And shells and silk and sandal-wood
966,THE GATE OF PEACE,That sailor men admire;
967,THE GATE OF PEACE,
968,THE GATE OF PEACE,"With figs and dates from Samarcand,"
969,THE GATE OF PEACE,"And squatty ginger-jars,"
970,THE GATE OF PEACE,And scented silver amulets
971,THE GATE OF PEACE,From Indian bazaars;
972,THE GATE OF PEACE,
973,THE GATE OF PEACE,"With sugar-cane from Port of Spain,"
974,THE GATE OF PEACE,"And monkeys from Ceylon,"
975,THE GATE OF PEACE,And paper lanterns from Pekin
976,THE GATE OF PEACE,With painted dragons on;
977,THE GATE OF PEACE,
978,THE GATE OF PEACE,"With cocoanuts from Zanzibar,"
979,THE GATE OF PEACE,And pines from Singapore;
980,THE GATE OF PEACE,And when they had unloaded these
981,THE GATE OF PEACE,They could go back for more.
982,THE GATE OF PEACE,
983,THE GATE OF PEACE,And even after I was big
984,THE GATE OF PEACE,"And had to go to school,"
985,THE GATE OF PEACE,My mind was often far away
986,THE GATE OF PEACE,Aboard the Ships of Yule.
987,THE GATE OF PEACE,
988,THE GATE OF PEACE,
989,THE GATE OF PEACE,
990,THE GATE OF PEACE,
991,THE GATE OF PEACE,The Ships of Saint John
992,THE GATE OF PEACE,
993,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Where are the ships I used to know,"
994,THE GATE OF PEACE,That came to port on the Fundy tide
995,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Half a century ago,"
996,THE GATE OF PEACE,In beauty and stately pride?
997,THE GATE OF PEACE,
998,THE GATE OF PEACE,"In they would come past the beacon light,"
999,THE GATE OF PEACE,"With the sun on gleaming sail and spar,"
1000,THE GATE OF PEACE,Folding their wings like birds in flight
1001,THE GATE OF PEACE,From countries strange and far.
1002,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1003,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Schooner and brig and barkentine,"
1004,THE GATE OF PEACE,"I watched them slow as the sails were furled,"
1005,THE GATE OF PEACE,And wondered what cities they must have seen
1006,THE GATE OF PEACE,On the other side of the world.
1007,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1008,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Frenchman and Britisher and Dane,"
1009,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Yankee, Spaniard and Portugee,"
1010,THE GATE OF PEACE,And many a home ship back again
1011,THE GATE OF PEACE,With her stories of the sea.
1012,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1013,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Calm and victorious, at rest"
1014,THE GATE OF PEACE,"From the relentless, rough sea-play,"
1015,THE GATE OF PEACE,The wild duck on the river's breast
1016,THE GATE OF PEACE,Was not more sure than they.
1017,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1018,THE GATE OF PEACE,"The creatures of a passing race,"
1019,THE GATE OF PEACE,"The dark spruce forests made them strong,"
1020,THE GATE OF PEACE,"The sea's lore gave them magic grace,"
1021,THE GATE OF PEACE,The great winds taught them song.
1022,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1023,THE GATE OF PEACE,And God endowed them each with life--
1024,THE GATE OF PEACE,His blessing on the craftsman's skill--
1025,THE GATE OF PEACE,To meet the blind unreasoned strife
1026,THE GATE OF PEACE,And dare the risk of ill.
1027,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1028,THE GATE OF PEACE,Not mere insensate wood and paint
1029,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Obedient to the helm's command,"
1030,THE GATE OF PEACE,But often restive as a saint
1031,THE GATE OF PEACE,Beneath the Heavenly hand.
1032,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1033,THE GATE OF PEACE,All the beauty and mystery
1034,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Of life were there, adventure bold,"
1035,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Youth, and the glamour of the sea"
1036,THE GATE OF PEACE,And all its sorrows old.
1037,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1038,THE GATE OF PEACE,And many a time I saw them go
1039,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Out on the flood at morning brave,"
1040,THE GATE OF PEACE,"As the little tugs had them in tow,"
1041,THE GATE OF PEACE,And the sunlight danced on the wave.
1042,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1043,THE GATE OF PEACE,There all day long you could hear the sound
1044,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Of the caulking iron, the ship's bronze bell,"
1045,THE GATE OF PEACE,And the clank of the capstan going round
1046,THE GATE OF PEACE,As the great tides rose and fell.
1047,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1048,THE GATE OF PEACE,"The sailors' songs, the Captain's shout,"
1049,THE GATE OF PEACE,"The boatswain's whistle piping shrill,"
1050,THE GATE OF PEACE,"And the roar as the anchor chain runs out,--"
1051,THE GATE OF PEACE,I often hear them still.
1052,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1053,THE GATE OF PEACE,"I can see them still, the sun on their gear,"
1054,THE GATE OF PEACE,"The shining streak as the hulls careen,"
1055,THE GATE OF PEACE,"And the flag at the peak unfurling,--clear"
1056,THE GATE OF PEACE,As a picture on a screen.
1057,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1058,THE GATE OF PEACE,"The fog still hangs on the long tide-rips,"
1059,THE GATE OF PEACE,"The gulls go wavering to and fro,"
1060,THE GATE OF PEACE,But where are all the beautiful ships
1061,THE GATE OF PEACE,I knew so long ago?
1062,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1063,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1064,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1065,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1066,THE GATE OF PEACE,The Garden of Dreams
1067,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1068,THE GATE OF PEACE,My heart is a garden of dreams
1069,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Where you walk when day is done,"
1070,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Fair as the royal flowers,"
1071,THE GATE OF PEACE,Calm as the lingering sun.
1072,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1073,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Never a drouth comes there,"
1074,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Nor any frost that mars,"
1075,THE GATE OF PEACE,Only the wind of love
1076,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Under the early stars,--"
1077,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1078,THE GATE OF PEACE,The living breath that moves
1079,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Whispering to and fro,"
1080,THE GATE OF PEACE,Like the voice of God in the dusk
1081,THE GATE OF PEACE,Of the garden long ago.
1082,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1083,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1084,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1085,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1086,THE GATE OF PEACE,Garden Magic
1087,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1088,THE GATE OF PEACE,Within my stone-walled garden
1089,THE GATE OF PEACE,"(I see her standing now,"
1090,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Uplifted in the twilight,"
1091,THE GATE OF PEACE,With glory on her brow!)
1092,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1093,THE GATE OF PEACE,I love to walk at evening
1094,THE GATE OF PEACE,"And watch, when winds are low,"
1095,THE GATE OF PEACE,"The new moon in the tree-tops,"
1096,THE GATE OF PEACE,Because she loved it so!
1097,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1098,THE GATE OF PEACE,"And there entranced I listen,"
1099,THE GATE OF PEACE,"While flowers and winds confer,"
1100,THE GATE OF PEACE,And all their conversation
1101,THE GATE OF PEACE,Is redolent of her.
1102,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1103,THE GATE OF PEACE,"I love the trees that guard it,"
1104,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Upstanding and serene,"
1105,THE GATE OF PEACE,"So noble, so undaunted,"
1106,THE GATE OF PEACE,Because that was her mien.
1107,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1108,THE GATE OF PEACE,"I love the brook that bounds it,"
1109,THE GATE OF PEACE,Because its silver voice
1110,THE GATE OF PEACE,Is like her bubbling laughter
1111,THE GATE OF PEACE,That made the world rejoice.
1112,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1113,THE GATE OF PEACE,"I love the golden jonquils,"
1114,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Because she used to say,"
1115,THE GATE OF PEACE,If soul could choose a color
1116,THE GATE OF PEACE,It would be clothed as they.
1117,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1118,THE GATE OF PEACE,"I love the blue-gray iris,"
1119,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Because her eyes were blue,"
1120,THE GATE OF PEACE,Sea-deep and heaven-tender
1121,THE GATE OF PEACE,In meaning and in hue.
1122,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1123,THE GATE OF PEACE,"I love the small wild roses,"
1124,THE GATE OF PEACE,Because she used to stand
1125,THE GATE OF PEACE,Adoringly above them
1126,THE GATE OF PEACE,And bless them with her hand.
1127,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1128,THE GATE OF PEACE,These were her boon companions.
1129,THE GATE OF PEACE,But more than all the rest
1130,THE GATE OF PEACE,"I love the April lilac,"
1131,THE GATE OF PEACE,Because she loved it best.
1132,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1133,THE GATE OF PEACE,Soul of undying rapture!
1134,THE GATE OF PEACE,"How love's enchantment clings,"
1135,THE GATE OF PEACE,"With sorcery and fragrance,"
1136,THE GATE OF PEACE,About familiar things!
1137,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1138,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1139,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1140,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1141,THE GATE OF PEACE,In Gold Lacquer
1142,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1143,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Gold are the great trees overhead,"
1144,THE GATE OF PEACE,"And gold the leaf-strewn grass,"
1145,THE GATE OF PEACE,As though a cloth of gold were spread
1146,THE GATE OF PEACE,To let a seraph pass.
1147,THE GATE OF PEACE,"And where the pageant should go by,"
1148,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Meadow and wood and stream,"
1149,THE GATE OF PEACE,"The world is all of lacquered gold,"
1150,THE GATE OF PEACE,Expectant as a dream.
1151,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1152,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Against the sunset's burning gold,"
1153,THE GATE OF PEACE,Etched in dark monotone
1154,THE GATE OF PEACE,Behind its alley of grey trees
1155,THE GATE OF PEACE,"And gateposts of grey stone,"
1156,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Stands the Old Manse, about whose eaves"
1157,THE GATE OF PEACE,"An air of mystery clings,"
1158,THE GATE OF PEACE,Abandoned to the lonely peace
1159,THE GATE OF PEACE,Of bygone ghostly things.
1160,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1161,THE GATE OF PEACE,In molten gold the river winds
1162,THE GATE OF PEACE,"With languid sweep and turn,"
1163,THE GATE OF PEACE,Beside the red-gold wooded hill
1164,THE GATE OF PEACE,Yellowed with ash and fern.
1165,THE GATE OF PEACE,The streets are tiled with gold-green shade
1166,THE GATE OF PEACE,"And arched with fretted gold,"
1167,THE GATE OF PEACE,Ecstatic aisles that richly thread
1168,THE GATE OF PEACE,This minster grim and old.
1169,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1170,THE GATE OF PEACE,"The air is flecked with filtered gold,--"
1171,THE GATE OF PEACE,The shimmer of romance
1172,THE GATE OF PEACE,Whose ageless glamour still must hold
1173,THE GATE OF PEACE,"The world as in a trance,"
1174,THE GATE OF PEACE,Pouring o'er every time and place
1175,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Light of an amber sea,"
1176,THE GATE OF PEACE,The spell of all the gladsome things
1177,THE GATE OF PEACE,That have been or shall be.
1178,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1179,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1180,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1181,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1182,THE GATE OF PEACE,Aprilian
1183,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1184,THE GATE OF PEACE,When April came with sunshine
1185,THE GATE OF PEACE,"And showers and lilac bloom,"
1186,THE GATE OF PEACE,My heart with sudden gladness
1187,THE GATE OF PEACE,Was like a fragrant room.
1188,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1189,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Her eyes were heaven's own azure,"
1190,THE GATE OF PEACE,As deep as God's own truth.
1191,THE GATE OF PEACE,Her soul was made of rapture
1192,THE GATE OF PEACE,And mystery and youth.
1193,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1194,THE GATE OF PEACE,She knew the sorry burden
1195,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Of all the ancient years,"
1196,THE GATE OF PEACE,Yet could not dwell with sadness
1197,THE GATE OF PEACE,And memory and tears.
1198,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1199,THE GATE OF PEACE,With her there was no shadow
1200,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Of failure nor despair,"
1201,THE GATE OF PEACE,But only loving joyance.
1202,THE GATE OF PEACE,"O Heart, how glad we were!"
1203,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1204,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1205,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1206,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1207,THE GATE OF PEACE,Garden Shadows
1208,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1209,THE GATE OF PEACE,When the dawn winds whisper
1210,THE GATE OF PEACE,"To the standing corn,"
1211,THE GATE OF PEACE,And the rose of morning
1212,THE GATE OF PEACE,"From the dark is born,"
1213,THE GATE OF PEACE,All my shadowy garden
1214,THE GATE OF PEACE,Seems to grow aware
1215,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Of a fragrant presence,"
1216,THE GATE OF PEACE,Half expected there.
1217,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1218,THE GATE OF PEACE,In the golden shimmer
1219,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Of the burning noon,"
1220,THE GATE OF PEACE,When the birds are silent
1221,THE GATE OF PEACE,"And the poppies swoon,"
1222,THE GATE OF PEACE,Once more I behold her
1223,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Smile and turn her face,"
1224,THE GATE OF PEACE,"With its infinite regard,"
1225,THE GATE OF PEACE,Its immortal grace.
1226,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1227,THE GATE OF PEACE,When the twilight silvers
1228,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Every nodding flower,"
1229,THE GATE OF PEACE,And the new moon hallows
1230,THE GATE OF PEACE,"The first evening hour,"
1231,THE GATE OF PEACE,Is it not her footfall
1232,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Down the garden walks,"
1233,THE GATE OF PEACE,Where the drowsy blossoms
1234,THE GATE OF PEACE,Slumber on their stalks?
1235,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1236,THE GATE OF PEACE,"In the starry quiet,"
1237,THE GATE OF PEACE,"When the soul is free,"
1238,THE GATE OF PEACE,And a vernal message
1239,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Stirs the lilac tree,"
1240,THE GATE OF PEACE,Surely I have felt her
1241,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Pass and brush my cheek,"
1242,THE GATE OF PEACE,With the eloquence of love
1243,THE GATE OF PEACE,That does not need to speak!
1244,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1245,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1246,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1247,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1248,THE GATE OF PEACE,In The Day of Battle
1249,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1250,THE GATE OF PEACE,"In the day of battle,"
1251,THE GATE OF PEACE,"In the night of dread,"
1252,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Let one hymn be lifted,"
1253,THE GATE OF PEACE,Let one prayer be said.
1254,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1255,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Not for pride of conquest,"
1256,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Not for vengeance wrought,"
1257,THE GATE OF PEACE,Nor for peace and safety
1258,THE GATE OF PEACE,With dishonour bought!
1259,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1260,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Praise for faith in freedom,"
1261,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Our fighting fathers' stay,"
1262,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Born of dreams and daring,"
1263,THE GATE OF PEACE,Bred above dismay.
1264,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1265,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Prayer for cloudless vision,"
1266,THE GATE OF PEACE,"And the valiant hand,"
1267,THE GATE OF PEACE,That the right may triumph
1268,THE GATE OF PEACE,To the last demand.
1269,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1270,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1271,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1272,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1273,THE GATE OF PEACE,Trees
1274,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1275,THE GATE OF PEACE,"In the Garden of Eden, planted by God,"
1276,THE GATE OF PEACE,"There were goodly trees in the springing sod,--"
1277,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1278,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Trees of beauty and height and grace,"
1279,THE GATE OF PEACE,To stand in splendor before His face.
1280,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1281,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Apple and hickory, ash and pear,"
1282,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Oak and beech and the tulip rare,"
1283,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1284,THE GATE OF PEACE,"The trembling aspen, the noble pine,"
1285,THE GATE OF PEACE,The sweeping elm by the river line;
1286,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1287,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Trees for the birds to build and sing,"
1288,THE GATE OF PEACE,And the lilac tree for a joy in spring;
1289,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1290,THE GATE OF PEACE,Trees to turn at the frosty call
1291,THE GATE OF PEACE,And carpet the ground for their Lord's footfall;
1292,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1293,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Trees for fruitage and fire and shade,"
1294,THE GATE OF PEACE,Trees for the cunning builder's trade;
1295,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1296,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Wood for the bow, the spear, and the flail,"
1297,THE GATE OF PEACE,The keel and the mast of the daring sail;
1298,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1299,THE GATE OF PEACE,He made them of every grain and girth
1300,THE GATE OF PEACE,For the use of man in the Garden of Earth.
1301,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1302,THE GATE OF PEACE,Then lest the soul should not lift her eyes
1303,THE GATE OF PEACE,"From the gift to the Giver of Paradise,"
1304,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1305,THE GATE OF PEACE,"On the crown of a hill, for all to see,"
1306,THE GATE OF PEACE,God planted a scarlet maple tree.
1307,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1308,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1309,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1310,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1311,THE GATE OF PEACE,The Givers of Life
1312,THE GATE OF PEACE,
1313,I,I
1314,I,
1315,I,"Who called us forth out of darkness and gave us the gift of life,"
1316,I,"Who set our hands to the toiling, our feet in the field of strife?"
1317,I,
1318,I,"Darkly they mused, predestined to knowledge of viewless things,"
1319,I,"Sowing the seed of wisdom, guarding the living springs."
1320,I,
1321,I,"Little they reckoned privation, hunger or hardship or cold,"
1322,I,"If only the life might prosper, and the joy that grows not old."
1323,I,
1324,I,"With sorceries subtler than music, with knowledge older than speech,"
1325,I,"Gentle as wind in the wheat-field, strong as the tide on the beach,"
1326,I,
1327,I,"Out of their beauty and longing, out of their raptures and tears,"
1328,I,"In patience and pride they bore us, to war with the warring years."
1329,I,
1330,I,
1331,II,II
1332,II,
1333,II,"Who looked on the world before them, and summoned and chose"
1334,II,"our sires,"
1335,II,Subduing the wayward impulse to the will of their deep desires?
1336,II,
1337,II,"Sovereigns of ultimate issues under the greater laws,"
1338,II,Theirs was the mystic mission of the eternal cause;
1339,II,
1340,II,"Confident, tender, courageous, leaving the low for the higher,"
1341,II,Lifting the feet of the nations out of the dust and the mire;
1342,II,"Luring civilization on to the fair and new,"
1343,II,"Given God's bidding to follow, having God's business to do."
1344,II,
1345,II,
1346,III,III
1347,III,
1348,III,"Who strengthened our souls with courage, and taught us the ways"
1349,III,of Earth?
1350,III,"Who gave us our patterns of beauty, our standards of flawless worth?"
1351,III,
1352,III,"Mothers, unmilitant, lovely, moulding our manhood then,"
1353,III,"Walked in their woman's glory, swaying the might of men."
1354,III,
1355,III,"They schooled us to service and honor, modest and clean and fair,--"
1356,III,"The code of their worth of living, taught with the sanction"
1357,III,of prayer.
1358,III,"They were our sharers of sorrow, they were our makers of joy,"
1359,III,Lighting the lamp of manhood in the heart of the lonely boy.
1360,III,
1361,III,"Haloed with love and with wonder, in sheltered ways they trod,"
1362,III,"Seers of sublime divination, keeping the truce of God."
1363,III,
1364,III,
1365,IV,IV
1366,IV,
1367,IV,"Who called us from youth and dreaming, and set ambition alight,"
1368,IV,"And made us fit for the contest,--men, by their tender rite?"
1369,IV,
1370,IV,"Sweethearts above our merit, charming our strength and skill"
1371,IV,"To be the pride of their loving, to be the means of their will."
1372,IV,
1373,IV,"If we be the builders of beauty, if we be the masters of art,"
1374,IV,"Theirs were the gleaming ideals, theirs the uplift of the heart."
1375,IV,
1376,IV,"Truly they measure the lightness of trappings and ease and fame,"
1377,IV,For the teeming desire of their yearning is ever and ever the same:
1378,IV,
1379,IV,"To crown their lovers with gladness, to clothe their sons"
1380,IV,"with delight,"
1381,IV,And see the men of their making lords in the best man's right.
1382,IV,
1383,IV,"Lavish of joy and labor, broken only by wrong,"
1384,IV,"These are the guardians of being, spirited, sentient and strong."
1385,IV,
1386,IV,"Theirs is the starry vision, theirs the inspiriting hope,"
1387,IV,"Since Night, the brooding enchantress, promised that day"
1388,IV,should ope.
1389,IV,
1390,IV,
1391,V,V
1392,V,
1393,V,"Lo, we have built and invented, reasoned, discovered and planned,"
1394,V,"To rear us a palace of splendor, and make us a heaven by hand."
1395,V,
1396,V,"We are shaken with dark misgiving, as kingdoms rise and fall;"
1397,V,But the women who went to found them are never counted at all.
1398,V,
1399,V,"Versed in the soul's traditions, skilled in humanity's lore,"
1400,V,"They wait for their crown of rapture, and weep for the sins of war."
1401,V,
1402,V,"And behold they turn from our triumphs, as it was in the first"
1403,V,"of days,"
1404,V,For a little heaven of ardor and a little heartening of praise.
1405,V,
1406,V,"These are the rulers of kingdoms beyond the domains of state,"
1407,V,"Martyrs of all men's folly, over-rulers of fate."
1408,V,"These we will love and honor, these we will serve and defend,"
1409,V,"Fulfilling the pride of nature, till nature shall have an end."
1410,V,
1411,V,
1412,VI,VI
1413,VI,
1414,VI,"This is the code unwritten, this is the creed we hold,"
1415,VI,"Guarding the little and lonely, gladdening the helpless and old,--"
1416,VI,
1417,VI,"Apart from the brunt of the battle our wondrous women shall bide,"
1418,VI,For the sake of a tranquil wisdom and the need of a spirit's guide.
1419,VI,
1420,VI,"Come they into assembly, or keep they another door,"
1421,VI,Our makers of life shall lighten the days as the years of yore.
1422,VI,
1423,VI,"The lure of their laughter shall lead us, the lilt of their words"
1424,VI,shall sway.
1425,VI,"Though life and death should defeat us, their solace shall be"
1426,VI,our stay.
1427,VI,
1428,VI,"Veiled in mysterious beauty, vested in magical grace,"
1429,VI,They have walked with angels at twilight and looked upon glory's face.
1430,VI,
1431,VI,"Life we will give for their safety, care for their fruitful ease,"
1432,VI,Though we break at the toiling benches or go down in the smoky seas.
1433,VI,
1434,VI,This is the gospel appointed to govern a world of men.
1435,VI,"Till love has died, and the echoes have whispered the last Amen."
1436,VI,
1437,VI,
1438,VI,
1439,VI,
1440,VI,A Fireside Vision
1441,VI,
1442,VI,Once I walked the world enchanted
1443,VI,"Through the scented woods of spring,"
1444,VI,"Hand in hand with Love, in rapture"
1445,VI,Just to hear a bluebird sing.
1446,VI,
1447,VI,Now the lonely winds of autumn
1448,VI,"Moan about my gusty eaves,"
1449,VI,As I sit beside the fire
1450,VI,Listening to the flying leaves.
1451,VI,
1452,VI,As the dying embers settle
1453,VI,"And the twilight falls apace,"
1454,VI,Through the gloom I see a vision
1455,VI,"Full of ardor, full of grace."
1456,VI,
1457,VI,When the Architect of Beauty
1458,VI,"Breathed the lyric soul in man,"
1459,VI,"Lo, the being that he fashioned"
1460,VI,Was of such a mould and plan!
1461,VI,
1462,VI,Bravely through the deepening shadows
1463,VI,"Moves that figure half divine,"
1464,VI,"With its tenderness of bearing,"
1465,VI,With its dignity of line.
1466,VI,
1467,VI,Eyes more wonderful than evening
1468,VI,"With the new moon on the hill,"
1469,VI,Mouth with traces of God's humor
1470,VI,In its corners lurking still.
1471,VI,
1472,VI,"Ah, she smiles, in recollection;"
1473,VI,Lays a hand upon my brow;
1474,VI,Rests this head upon Love's bosom!
1475,VI,Surely it is April now!
1476,VI,
1477,VI,
1478,VI,
1479,VI,
1480,VI,A Water Color
1481,VI,
1482,VI,There's a picture in my room
1483,VI,"Lightens many an hour of gloom,--"
1484,VI,
1485,VI,Cheers me under fortune's frown
1486,VI,And the drudgery of town.
1487,VI,
1488,VI,Many and many a winter day
1489,VI,"When my soul sees all things gray,"
1490,VI,
1491,VI,"Here is veritable June,"
1492,VI,Heart's content and spirit's boon.
1493,VI,
1494,VI,"It is scarce a hand-breadth wide,"
1495,VI,"Not a span from side to side,"
1496,VI,
1497,VI,Yet it is an open door
1498,VI,"Looking back to joy once more,"
1499,VI,
1500,VI,"Where the level marshes lie,"
1501,VI,"A quiet journey of the eye,"
1502,VI,
1503,VI,And the unsubstantial blue
1504,VI,Makes the fine illusion true.
1505,VI,
1506,VI,So I forth and travel there
1507,VI,"In the blessed light and air,"
1508,VI,
1509,VI,Miles of green tranquillity
1510,VI,Down the river to the sea.
1511,VI,
1512,VI,"Here the sea-birds roam at will,"
1513,VI,And the sea-wind on the hill
1514,VI,
1515,VI,Brings the hollow pebbly roar
1516,VI,"From the dim and rosy shore,"
1517,VI,
1518,VI,With the very scent and draft
1519,VI,Of the old sea's mighty craft.
1520,VI,
1521,VI,"I am standing on the dunes,"
1522,VI,"By some charm that must be June's,"
1523,VI,
1524,VI,When the magic of her hand
1525,VI,Lays a sea-spell on the land.
1526,VI,
1527,VI,And the old enchantment falls
1528,VI,On the blue-gray orchard walls
1529,VI,
1530,VI,"And the purple high-top boles,"
1531,VI,While the orange orioles
1532,VI,
1533,VI,Flame and whistle through the green
1534,VI,Of that paradisal scene.
1535,VI,
1536,VI,Strolling idly for an hour
1537,VI,"Where the elder is in flower,"
1538,VI,
1539,VI,I can hear the bob-white call
1540,VI,Down beyond the pasture wall.
1541,VI,
1542,VI,"Musing in the scented heat,"
1543,VI,"Where the bayberry is sweet,"
1544,VI,
1545,VI,I can see the shadows run
1546,VI,Up the cliff-side in the sun.
1547,VI,
1548,VI,Or I cross the bridge and reach
1549,VI,"The mossers' houses on the beach,"
1550,VI,
1551,VI,Where the bathers on the sand
1552,VI,Lie sea-freshened and sun-tanned.
1553,VI,
1554,VI,Thus I pass the gates of time
1555,VI,"And the boundaries of clime,"
1556,VI,
1557,VI,Change the ugly man-made street
1558,VI,For God's country green and sweet.
1559,VI,
1560,VI,"Fag of body, irk of mind,"
1561,VI,"In a moment left behind,"
1562,VI,
1563,VI,Once more I possess my soul
1564,VI,With the poise and self-control
1565,VI,
1566,VI,Beauty gives the free of heart
1567,VI,Through the sorcery of art.
1568,VI,
1569,VI,
1570,VI,
1571,VI,
1572,VI,Threnody for a Poet
1573,VI,
1574,VI,"Not in the ancient abbey,"
1575,VI,"Nor in the city ground,"
1576,VI,"Not in the lonely mountains,"
1577,VI,"Nor in the blue profound,"
1578,VI,Lay him to rest when his time is come
1579,VI,And the smiling mortal lips are dumb;
1580,VI,
1581,VI,But here in the decent quiet
1582,VI,"Under the whispering pines,"
1583,VI,Where the dogwood breaks in blossom
1584,VI,"And the peaceful sunlight shines,"
1585,VI,"Where wild birds sing and ferns unfold,"
1586,VI,When spring comes back in her green and gold.
1587,VI,
1588,VI,And when that mortal likeness
1589,VI,"Has been dissolved by fire,"
1590,VI,"Say not above the ashes,"
1591,VI,"""Here ends a man's desire."""
1592,VI,"For every year when the bluebirds sing,"
1593,VI,He shall be part of the lyric spring.
1594,VI,
1595,VI,Then dreamful-hearted lovers
1596,VI,Shall hear in wind and rain
1597,VI,"The cadence of his music,"
1598,VI,"The rhythm of his refrain,"
1599,VI,For he was a blade of the April sod
1600,VI,That bowed and blew with the whisper of God.
1601,VI,
1602,VI,
1603,VI,
1604,VI,
1605,VI,Dust of the Street
1606,VI,
1607,VI,This cosmic dust beneath our feet
1608,VI,"Rising to hurry down the street,"
1609,VI,
1610,VI,Borne by the wind and blown astray
1611,VI,"In its erratic, senseless way,"
1612,VI,
1613,VI,Is the same stuff as you and I--
1614,VI,With knowledge and desire put by.
1615,VI,
1616,VI,Thousands of times since time began
1617,VI,"It has been used for making man,"
1618,VI,
1619,VI,Freighted like us with every sense
1620,VI,"Of spirit and intelligence,"
1621,VI,
1622,VI,To walk the world and know the fine
1623,VI,Large consciousness of things divine.
1624,VI,
1625,VI,These wandering atoms in their day
1626,VI,"Perhaps have passed this very way,"
1627,VI,
1628,VI,"With eager step and flowerlike face,"
1629,VI,"With lovely ardor, poise, and grace,"
1630,VI,
1631,VI,"On what delightful errands bent,"
1632,VI,"Passionate, generous, and intent,--"
1633,VI,
1634,VI,"An angel still, though veiled and gloved,"
1635,VI,Made to love us and to be loved.
1636,VI,
1637,VI,"Friends, when the summons comes for me"
1638,VI,To turn my back (reluctantly)
1639,VI,
1640,VI,"On this delightful play, I claim"
1641,VI,Only one thing in friendship's name;
1642,VI,
1643,VI,And you will not decline a task
1644,VI,"So slight, when it is all I ask:"
1645,VI,
1646,VI,Scatter my ashes in the street
1647,VI,Where avenue and crossway meet.

1653,VI,An unimportant name and date.
1654,VI,
1655,VI,Others may wish to lay them down
1656,VI,"On some fair hillside far from town,"
1657,VI,
1658,VI,Where slim white birches wave and gleam
1659,VI,"Beside a shadowy woodland stream,"
1660,VI,
1661,VI,"Or in luxurious beds of fern,"

1674,VI,The bandits by and by
1675,VI,Will bid you go with them.

1683,VI,"Of all the spoils they bear,--"

1685,VI,"Their joy, to keep you fair."
1686,VI,

1731,VI,
1732,VI,I am homesick for the mountains--
1733,VI,My heroic mother hills--
1734,VI,And the longing that is on me
1735,VI,No solace ever stills.
1736,VI,
1737,VI,I would climb to brooding summits
1738,VI,"With their old untarnished dreams,"
1739,VI,Cool my heart in forest shadows
1740,VI,To the lull of falling streams;
1741,VI,
1742,VI,Hear the innocence of aspens
1743,VI,"That babble in the breeze,"
1744,VI,And the fragrant sudden showers
1745,VI,That patter on the trees.
1746,VI,
1747,VI,I am lonely for my thrushes
1748,VI,"In their hermitage withdrawn,"
1749,VI,Toning the quiet transports
1750,VI,Of twilight and of dawn.
1751,VI,
1752,VI,"I need the pure, strong mornings,"
1753,VI,"When the soul of day is still,"
1754,VI,With the touch of frost that kindles
1755,VI,The scarlet on the hill;
1756,VI,
1757,VI,Lone trails and winding woodroads
1758,VI,"To outlooks wild and high,"
1759,VI,And the pale moon waiting sundown
1760,VI,Where ledges cut the sky.
1761,VI,
1762,VI,I dream of upland clearings
1763,VI,"Where cones of sumac burn,"
1764,VI,And gaunt and gray-mossed boulders
1765,VI,Lie deep in beds of fern;
1766,VI,
1767,VI,"The gray and mottled beeches,"
1768,VI,"The birches' satin sheen,"
1769,VI,The majesty of hemlocks
1770,VI,Crowning the blue ravine.
1771,VI,
1772,VI,My eyes dim for the skyline
1773,VI,"Where purple peaks aspire,"
1774,VI,And the forges of the sunset
1775,VI,Flare up in golden fire.
1776,VI,
1777,VI,There crests look down unheeding
1778,VI,"And see the great winds blow,"
1779,VI,Tossing the huddled tree-tops
1780,VI,In gorges far below;
1781,VI,
1782,VI,Where cloud-mists from the warm earth
1783,VI,"Roll up about their knees,"
1784,VI,And hang their filmy tatters
1785,VI,Like prayers upon the trees.
1786,VI,
1787,VI,I cry for night-blue shadows
1788,VI,"On plain and hill and dome,--"

1799,VI,Is glad with summer.  Deep in shade it lies
1800,VI,"A mighty cleft between the bosoming hills,"
1801,VI,A cool dim gateway to the mountains' heart.
1802,VI,
1803,VI,"On either side the wooded slopes come down,"
1804,VI,Hemlock and beech and chestnut.  Here and there
1805,VI,"Through the deep forest laurel spreads and gleams,"
1806,VI,Pink-white as Daphne in her loveliness.
1807,VI,Among the sunlit shadows I can see
1808,VI,"That still perfection from the world withdrawn,"
1809,VI,As if the wood-gods had arrested there
1810,VI,Immortal beauty in her breathless flight.
1811,VI,
1812,VI,"The road winds in from the broad river-lands,"
1813,VI,Luring the happy traveller turn by turn
1814,VI,Up to the lofty mountains of the sky.
1815,VI,"And as he marches with uplifted face,"
1816,VI,Far overhead against the arching blue
1817,VI,"Gray ledges overhang from dizzy heights,"
1818,VI,Scarred by a thousand winters and untamed.
1819,VI,
1820,VI,"And where the road runs in the valley's foot,"
1821,VI,"Through the dark woods a mountain stream comes down,"
1822,VI,Singing and dancing all its youth away
1823,VI,"Among the boulders and the shallow runs,"
1824,VI,Where sunbeams pierce and mossy tree trunks hang
1825,VI,Drenched all day long with murmuring sound and spray.
1826,VI,
1827,VI,"There light of heart and footfree, I would go"
1828,VI,Up to my home among the lasting hills.
1829,VI,"Nearing the day's end, I would leave the road,"
1830,VI,Turn to the left and take the steeper trail
1831,VI,"That climbs among the hemlocks, and at last"
1832,VI,"In my own cabin doorway sit me down,"
1833,VI,Companioned in that leafy solitude
1834,VI,"By the wood ghosts of twilight and of peace,"
1835,VI,While evening passes to absolve the day
1836,VI,And leave the tranquil mountains to the stars.
1837,VI,
1838,VI,"And in that sweet seclusion I should hear,"
1839,VI,"Among the cool-leafed beeches in the dusk,"
1840,VI,The calm-voiced thrushes at their twilight hymn.
1841,VI,"So undistraught, so rapturous, so pure,"
1842,VI,"They well might be, in wisdom and in joy,"
1843,VI,The seraphs singing at the birth of time
1844,VI,The unworn ritual of eternal things.

1852,VI,The stealthy shadows of the summer clouds
1853,VI,"Trail through the cañon, and the mountain stream"
1854,VI,Sounds his sonorous music far below
1855,VI,In the deep-wooded wind-enchanted cove.
1856,VI,
1857,VI,"Hemlock and aspen, chestnut, beech, and fir"
1858,VI,"Go tiering down from storm-worn crest and ledge,"
1859,VI,While in the hollows of the dark ravine
1860,VI,"See the red road emerge, then disappear"
1861,VI,Towards the wide plain and fertile valley lands.
1862,VI,
1863,VI,My forest cabin half-way up the glen
1864,VI,"Is solitary, save for one wise thrush,"
1865,VI,"The sound of falling water, and the wind"
1866,VI,Mysteriously conversing with the leaves.
1867,VI,
1868,VI,"Here I abide unvisited by doubt,"
1869,VI,"Dreaming of far-off turmoil and despair,"
1870,VI,"The race of men and love and fleeting time,"
1871,VI,"What life may be, or beauty, caught and held"
1872,VI,For a brief moment at eternal poise.
1873,VI,
1874,VI,What impulse now shall quicken and make live
1875,VI,This outward semblance and this inward self?
1876,VI,"One breath of being fills the bubble world,"
1877,VI,"Colored and frail, with fleeting change on change."
1878,VI,
1879,VI,Surely some God contrived so fair a thing
1880,VI,"In a vast leisure of uncounted days,"
1881,VI,"And touched it with the breath of living joy,"
1882,VI,Wondrous and fair and wise!  It must be so.

1894,VI,It is the path we traversed
1895,VI,"One twilight, thou and I;"
1896,VI,"Thy beauty all a rapture,"
1897,VI,My spirit all a cry.
1898,VI,
1899,VI,"The red leaves fall upon it,"
1900,VI,"The moon and mist and rain,"

1918,VI,
1919,VI,And in its tranquil autumns
1920,VI,We halt to re-enforce
1921,VI,Our tattered scarlet pennons
1922,VI,With valor and resource.
1923,VI,
1924,VI,From undiscovered regions
1925,VI,"Only the angels know,"
1926,VI,Great winds of aspiration

1928,VI,
1929,VI,To free the sap of impulse
1930,VI,"From torpor of distrust,"
1931,VI,And into flowers of joyance
1932,VI,Quicken the sentient dust.
1933,VI,
1934,VI,From nowhere of a sudden
1935,VI,"Loom sudden clouds of fault,"
1936,VI,With thunders of oppression
1937,VI,And lightnings of revolt.
1938,VI,
1939,VI,With hush of apprehension
1940,VI,"And quaking of the heart,"
1941,VI,"There breed the storms of anger,"
1942,VI,And floods of sorrow start.
1943,VI,
1944,VI,"And there shall fall,--how gently!--"
1945,VI,"To make them fertile yet,"
1946,VI,The rain of absolution
1947,VI,On acres of regret.
1948,VI,
1949,VI,Till snows of mercy cover

1961,VI,"Walled with stone and roofed with sun,"
1962,VI,"Where the days pass one by one,"
1963,VI,"Not too fast and not too slow,"
1964,VI,Looking backward as they go
1965,VI,At the beauties left behind
1966,VI,To transport the pensive mind!
1967,VI,
1968,VI,Is it not a greening ground
1969,VI,"With a river for its bound,"
1970,VI,And a wood-thrush to prolong
1971,VI,"Fragrant twilights with his song,"
1972,VI,When the peonies in June
1973,VI,"Wait the rising of the moon,"
1974,VI,And the music of the stream
1975,VI,Voices its immortal dream!
1976,VI,
1977,VI,There each morning will renew
1978,VI,"The miracle of light and dew,"
1979,VI,And the soul may joy to praise
1980,VI,The Lord of roses and of days;
1981,VI,There the caravan of noon
1982,VI,"Halts to hear the cricket's tune,"
1983,VI,Fifing there for all who pass
1984,VI,The anthem of the summer grass!
1985,VI,
1986,VI,Does not Heaven begin that day
1987,VI,"When the eager heart can say,"
1988,VI,"Surely God is in this place,"
1989,VI,I have seen Him face to face
1990,VI,"In the loveliness of flowers,"
1991,VI,"In the service of the showers,"
1992,VI,And His voice has talked to me
1993,VI,In the sunlit apple tree.
1994,VI,
1995,VI,"I can feel Him in my heart,"
1996,VI,When the tears of knowledge start
1997,VI,"For another's joy or woe,"
1998,VI,Where the lonely soul must go.
1999,VI,"Yea, I learned His very look,"
2000,VI,"When we walked beside the brook,"
2001,VI,And you smiled and touched my hand.

2014,VI,That angel of the calm
2015,VI,"All-comprehending smile,"

2017,VI,No falsity beguile.
2018,VI,
2019,VI,Out of the house of life
2020,VI,Before him fled away
2021,VI,"Languor, regret, and strife"
2022,VI,And sorrow on that day.
2023,VI,
2024,VI,"Grim fear, unmanly doubt,"
2025,VI,And impotent despair
2026,VI,Went at his bidding forth
2027,VI,"Among the things that were,--"
2028,VI,
2029,VI,"Leaving a place all clean,"
2030,VI,Resounding of the sea
2031,VI,"And decked with forest green,"

2052,VI,A familiar grace.

2059,VI,Let the breeze of twilight blow
2060,VI,"Through the silent hall,"
2061,VI,And the dreaming rafters hear
2062,VI,How the thrushes call.
2063,VI,
2064,VI,"Oh, be merciful and fond"

2113,VI,

2191,VI,Hears among the thrushes
2192,VI,In the woods of June;
2193,VI,
2194,VI,Delicate as grasses
2195,VI,When they lift and stir--
2196,VI,One sweet lyric woman--
2197,VI,I give thanks for her.

2202,VI,The Enchanted Traveller
2203,VI,
2204,VI,We travelled empty-handed
2205,VI,"With hearts all fear above,"
2206,VI,"For we ate the bread of friendship,"
2207,VI,We drank the wine of love.
2208,VI,
2209,VI,"Through many a wondrous autumn,"
2210,VI,"Through many a magic spring,"
2211,VI,"We hailed the scarlet banners,"
2212,VI,We heard the blue-bird sing.
2213,VI,
2214,VI,We looked on life and nature
2215,VI,"With the eager eyes of youth,"
2216,VI,And all we asked or cared for
2217,VI,"Was beauty, joy, and truth."
2218,VI,
2219,VI,"We found no other wisdom,"
2220,VI,"We learned no other way,"
2221,VI,"Than the gladness of the morning,"
2222,VI,The glory of the day.
2223,VI,
2224,VI,So all our earthly treasure
2225,VI,"Shall go with us, my dears,"
2226,VI,"Aboard the Shadow Liner,"
2227,VI,Across the sea of years.

2232,VI,Spring's Saraband
2233,VI,
2234,VI,Over the hills of April
2235,VI,"With soft winds hand in hand,"
2236,VI,"Impassionate and dreamy-eyed,"
2237,VI,Spring leads her saraband.
2238,VI,Her garments float and gather
2239,VI,"And swirl along the plain,"
2240,VI,"Her headgear is the golden sun,"
2241,VI,Her cloak the silver rain.
2242,VI,
2243,VI,"With color and with music,"
2244,VI,"With perfumes and with pomp,"
2245,VI,"By meadowland and upland,"
2246,VI,"Through pasture, wood, and swamp,"
2247,VI,With promise and enchantment
2248,VI,"Leading her mystic mime,"
2249,VI,She comes to lure the world anew
2250,VI,With joy as old as time.
2251,VI,
2252,VI,Quick lifts the marshy chorus
2253,VI,"To transport, trill on trill;"
2254,VI,There's not a rod of stony ground
2255,VI,Unanswering on the hill.
2256,VI,The brooks and little rivers
2257,VI,"Dance down their wild ravines,"
2258,VI,And children in the city squares
2259,VI,"Keep time, to tambourines."
2260,VI,
2261,VI,The bluebird in the orchard
2262,VI,"Is lyrical for her,"
2263,VI,The blackbird with his meadow pipe
2264,VI,"Sets all the wood astir,"
2265,VI,The hooded white spring-beauties
2266,VI,"Are curtsying in the breeze,"
2267,VI,The blue hepaticas are out
2268,VI,Under the chestnut trees.
2269,VI,
2270,VI,"The maple buds make glamor,"
2271,VI,"Viburnum waves its bloom,"
2272,VI,The daffodils and tulips
2273,VI,Are risen from the tomb.
2274,VI,The lances of Narcissus
2275,VI,Have pierced the wintry mold;
2276,VI,The commonplace seems paradise
2277,VI,Through veils of greening gold.
2278,VI,
2279,VI,"O heart, hear thou the summons,"
2280,VI,"Put every grief away,"
2281,VI,When all the motley masques of earth
2282,VI,Are glad upon a day.
2283,VI,"Alack, that any mortal"
2284,VI,Should less than gladness bring
2285,VI,Into the choral joy that sounds
2286,VI,The saraband of spring!
2287,VI,
2288,VI,
2289,VI,
2290,VI,
2291,VI,Triumphalis
2292,VI,
2293,VI,"Soul, art thou sad again"
2294,VI,With the old sadness?
2295,VI,Thou shalt be glad again
2296,VI,"With a new gladness,"
2297,VI,When April sun and rain
2298,VI,Mount to the teeming brain
2299,VI,With the earth madness.
2300,VI,
2301,VI,"When from the mould again,"
2302,VI,"Spurning disaster,"
2303,VI,"Spring shoots unfold again,"
2304,VI,Follow thou faster
2305,VI,Out of the drear domain
2306,VI,"Of dark, defeat, and pain,"
2307,VI,Praising the Master.
2308,VI,
2309,VI,"Hope for thy guide again,"
2310,VI,Ample and splendid;
2311,VI,"Love at thy side again,"
2312,VI,All doubting ended;
2313,VI,"(Ah, by the dragon slain,"
2314,VI,For nothing small or vain
2315,VI,Michael contended!)
2316,VI,
2317,VI,"Thou shalt take heart again,"
2318,VI,No more despairing;
2319,VI,"Play thy great part again,"
2320,VI,Loving and caring.
2321,VI,"Hark, how the gold refrain"
2322,VI,"Runs through the iron strain,"
2323,VI,Splendidly daring!
2324,VI,
2325,VI,"Thou shalt grow strong again,"
2326,VI,"Confident, tender,--"
2327,VI,"Battle with wrong again,"
2328,VI,"Be truth's defender,--"
2329,VI,"Of the immortal train,"
2330,VI,"Born to attempt, attain,"
2331,VI,Never surrender!

2334,VI,
2335,VI,
2336,VI,"""Now the Lengthening Twilights Hold"""
2337,VI,
2338,VI,Now the lengthening twilights hold
2339,VI,"Tints of lavender and gold,"
2340,VI,And the marshy places ring
2341,VI,With the pipers of the spring.
2342,VI,
2343,VI,Now the solitary star
2344,VI,"Lays a path on meadow streams,"
2345,VI,And I know it is not far
2346,VI,To the open door of dreams.
2347,VI,
2348,VI,"Lord of April, in my hour"
2349,VI,"May the dogwood be in flower,"
2350,VI,And my angel through the dome
2351,VI,Of spring twilight lead me home.

2356,VI,The Soul of April

2358,VI,Over the wintry threshold
2359,VI,"Who comes with joy to-day,"
2360,VI,"So frail, yet so enduring,"
2361,VI,To triumph o'er dismay?
2362,VI,
2363,VI,"Ah, quick her tears are springing,"
2364,VI,"And quickly they are dried,"
2365,VI,"For sorrow walks before her,"
2366,VI,But gladness walks beside.
2367,VI,
2368,VI,"She comes with gusts of laughter,--"
2369,VI,The music as of rills;
2370,VI,"With tenderness and sweetness,--"
2371,VI,The wisdom of the hills.
2372,VI,
2373,VI,"Her hands are strong to comfort,"
2374,VI,Her heart is quick to heed.
2375,VI,"She knows the signs of sadness,"
2376,VI,She knows the voice of need.
2377,VI,
2378,VI,"There is no living creature,"
2379,VI,"However poor or small,"
2380,VI,"But she will know its trouble,"
2381,VI,And hasten to its call.
2382,VI,
2383,VI,"Oh, well they fare forever,"
2384,VI,"By mighty dreams possessed,"
2385,VI,Whose hearts have lain a moment
2386,VI,On that eternal breast.

2391,VI,An April Morning
2392,VI,
2393,VI,Once more in misted April
2394,VI,The world is growing green.
2395,VI,Along the winding river
2396,VI,The plumey willows lean.
2397,VI,
2398,VI,Beyond the sweeping meadows
2399,VI,"The looming mountains rise,"
2400,VI,Like battlements of dreamland
2401,VI,Against the brooding skies.
2402,VI,
2403,VI,In every wooded valley
2404,VI,"The buds are breaking through,"
2405,VI,As though the heart of all things
2406,VI,No languor ever knew.
2407,VI,
2408,VI,The golden-wings and bluebirds
2409,VI,Call to their heavenly choirs.
2410,VI,The pines are blued and drifted
2411,VI,With smoke of brushwood fires.
2412,VI,
2413,VI,And in my sister's garden
2414,VI,"Where little breezes run,"
2415,VI,The golden daffodillies

2566,IV,While the early tender twilight
2567,IV,Breathes of those who come no more.

2573,IV,Touched with such immortal madness
2574,IV,Not a thing they care to know

2577,IV,
2578,IV,"In old Egypt for Osiris,"
2579,IV,"Putting on the green attire,"
2580,IV,With soft hymns and choric dancing
2581,IV,They went forth to greet the fire
2582,IV,"Of the vernal sun, whose ardor"
2583,IV,His earth children could inspire;
2584,IV,And the ivory flutes would lead them
2585,IV,To the slake of their desire.

2587,IV,In remembrance of Adonis

2656,IV,"of Silvermine,"
2657,IV,"Blowing an air on his pipe of willow, just as the moon began"
2658,IV,to shine;
2659,IV,"Or say that, coming from town on Wednesday, I met Christ walking"

2662,IV,"enough red meat!"""
2663,IV,
2664,IV,"Then let me ask you.  Last December, when there was skating"
2665,IV,"on Wampanaw,"
2666,IV,Among the weeds and sticks and grasses under the hard black
2667,IV,ice I saw
2668,IV,"An old mud-turtle poking about, as if he were putting his house"
2669,IV,"to rights,"
2670,IV,"Stiff with the cold perhaps, yet knowing enough to prepare"
2671,IV,for the winter nights.
2672,IV,
2673,IV,"And here he is on a log this morning, sunning himself as calm"
2674,IV,as you please.
2675,IV,"But I want to know, when the lock of winter was sprung of a sudden,"
2676,IV,who kept the keys?
2677,IV,Who told old nibbler to go to sleep safe and sound with the
2678,IV,"lily roots,"
2679,IV,And then in the first warm days of April--out to the sun
2680,IV,with the greening shoots?
2681,IV,
2682,IV,"By night a flock of geese went over, honking north on the trails"
2683,IV,"of air,"
2684,IV,"The spring express--but who despatched it, equipped with speed"
2685,IV,and cunning care?
2686,IV,Hark to our bluebird down in the orchard trolling his chant
2687,IV,"of the happy heart,"
2688,IV,As full of light as a theme of Mozart's--but where did he learn
2689,IV,that more than art?
2690,IV,
2691,IV,"Where the river winds through grassy meadows, as sure as the"
2692,IV,"south wind brings the rain,"
2693,IV,"Sounding his reedy note in the alders, the redwing comes back"
2694,IV,to his nest again.
2695,IV,"Are these not miracles?  Prompt you answer: ""Merely the prose"

2697,IV,"Nothing but instinct plain and patent, born in the creatures,"
2698,IV,"that bids them act."""
2699,IV,
2700,IV,"Well, I have an instinct as fine and valid, surely, as that"
2701,IV,"of the beasts and birds,"
2702,IV,"Concerning death and the life immortal, too deep for logic,"
2703,IV,too vague for words.
2704,IV,"No trace of beauty can pass or perish, but other beauty"
2705,IV,is somewhere born;
2706,IV,"No seed of truth or good be planted, but the yield must grow"
2707,IV,as the growing corn.
2708,IV,
2709,IV,Therefore this ardent mind and spirit I give to the glowing days

2712,IV,and lovely worth.
2713,IV,"If the toil I give be without self-seeking, bestowed to the limit"

2717,IV,
2718,IV,"It matters not though defeat undo me, though faults betray me"

2724,IV,Is it not well with these forever?  Can the soul of man fare
2725,IV,ill in the end?
2726,IV,
2727,IV,
2728,IV,
2729,IV,
2730,IV,Now is the Time of Year
2731,IV,
2732,IV,Now is the time of year
2733,IV,"When all the flutes begin,--"
2734,IV,"The redwing bold and clear,"
2735,IV,The rainbird far and thin.
2736,IV,
2737,IV,In all the waking lands
2738,IV,There's not a wilding thing
2739,IV,But knows and understands
2740,IV,The burden of the spring.
2741,IV,
2742,IV,Now every voice alive
2743,IV,By rocky wood and stream
2744,IV,Is lifted to revive
2745,IV,"The ecstasy, the dream."
2746,IV,
2747,IV,"For Nature, never old,"
2748,IV,"But busy as of yore,"
2749,IV,From sun and rain and mould
2750,IV,Is making spring once more.
2751,IV,
2752,IV,She sounds her magic note
2753,IV,"By river-marge and hill,"
2754,IV,And every woodland throat
2755,IV,Re-echoes with a thrill.
2756,IV,
2757,IV,"O mother of our days,"
2758,IV,Hearing thy music call.
2759,IV,Teach us to know thy ways
2760,IV,And fear no more at all!
2761,IV,
2762,IV,
2763,IV,
2764,IV,
2765,IV,The Redwing
2766,IV,
2767,IV,"I hear you, Brother, I hear you,"
2768,IV,"Down in the alder swamp,"
2769,IV,Springing your woodland whistle
2770,IV,To herald the April pomp!
2771,IV,
2772,IV,"First of the moving vanguard,"
2773,IV,"In front of the spring you come,"
2774,IV,Where flooded waters sparkle
2775,IV,And streams in the twilight hum.
2776,IV,
2777,IV,You sound the note of the chorus
2778,IV,"By meadow and woodland pond,"
2779,IV,"Till, one after one up-piping,"
2780,IV,A myriad throats respond.
2781,IV,
2782,IV,"I see you, Brother, I see you,"
2783,IV,"With scarlet under your wing,"
2784,IV,"Flash through the ruddy maples,"
2785,IV,Leading the pageant of spring.
2786,IV,
2787,IV,Earth has put off her raiment
2788,IV,"Wintry and worn and old,"
2789,IV,For the robe of a fair young sibyl.
2790,IV,Dancing in green and gold.
2791,IV,
2792,IV,"I heed you, Brother.  To-morrow"
2793,IV,"I, too, in the great employ,"
2794,IV,Will shed my old coat of sorrow
2795,IV,For a brand-new garment of joy.
2796,IV,
2797,IV,
2798,IV,
2799,IV,
2800,IV,The Rainbird
2801,IV,
2802,IV,I hear a rainbird singing
2803,IV,Far off.  How fine and clear
2804,IV,His plaintive voice comes ringing
2805,IV,With rapture to the ear!
2806,IV,
2807,IV,"Over the misty wood-lots,"
2808,IV,"Across the first spring heat,"
2809,IV,"Comes the enchanted cadence,"
2810,IV,"So clear, so solemn-sweet."
2811,IV,
2812,IV,How often I have hearkened
2813,IV,To that high pealing strain
2814,IV,"Across wild cedar barrens,"
2815,IV,Under the soft gray rain!
2816,IV,
2817,IV,"How often I have wondered,"
2818,IV,And longed in vain to know
2819,IV,"The source of that enchantment,"
2820,IV,That touch of human woe!
2821,IV,
2822,IV,"O brother, who first taught thee"
2823,IV,To haunt the teeming spring
2824,IV,With that sad mortal wisdom
2825,IV,Which only age can bring?
2826,IV,
2827,IV,
2828,IV,
2829,IV,
2830,IV,Lament
2831,IV,
2832,IV,When you hear the white-throat pealing
2833,IV,"From a tree-top far away,"
2834,IV,And the hills are touched with purple
2835,IV,At the borders of the day;
2836,IV,
2837,IV,When the redwing sounds his whistle
2838,IV,"At the coming on of spring,"
2839,IV,And the joyous April pipers
2840,IV,Make the alder marshes ring;
2841,IV,
2842,IV,When the wild new breath of being
2843,IV,"Whispers to the world once more,"
2844,IV,And before the shrine of beauty
2845,IV,Every spirit must adore;
2846,IV,
2847,IV,"When long thoughts come back with twilight,"
2848,IV,And a tender deepened mood
2849,IV,Shows the eyes of the beloved
2850,IV,Like the hepaticas in the wood;
2851,IV,
2852,IV,"Ah, remember, when to nothing"
2853,IV,"Save to love your heart gives heed,"
2854,IV,"And spring takes you to her bosom,--"
2855,IV,So it was with Golden Weed!
2856,IV,
2857,IV,
2858,IV,
2859,IV,
2860,IV,Under the April Moon
2861,IV,
2862,IV,"Oh, well the world is dreaming"
2863,IV,"Under the April moon,"
2864,IV,"Her soul in love with beauty,"
2865,IV,Her senses all a-swoon!
2866,IV,
2867,IV,Pure hangs the silver crescent
2868,IV,"Above the twilight wood,"
2869,IV,And pure the silver music
2870,IV,Wakes from the marshy flood.
2871,IV,
2872,IV,"O Earth, with all thy transport,"
2873,IV,How comes it life should seem
2874,IV,"A shadow in the moonlight,"
2875,IV,A murmur in a dream?
2876,IV,
2877,IV,
2878,IV,
2879,IV,
2880,IV,The Flute of Spring
2881,IV,
2882,IV,I know a shining meadow stream
2883,IV,"That winds beneath an Eastern hill,"
2884,IV,And all year long in sun or gloom
2885,IV,Its murmuring voice is never still.
2886,IV,
2887,IV,"The summer dies more gently there,"
2888,IV,"The April flowers are earlier,--"
2889,IV,The first warm rain-wind from the Sound
2890,IV,Sets all their eager hearts astir.
2891,IV,
2892,IV,And there when lengthening twilights fall
2893,IV,"As softly as a wild bird's wing,"
2894,IV,Across the valley in the dusk
2895,IV,I hear the silver flute of spring.
2896,IV,
2897,IV,
2898,IV,
2899,IV,
2900,IV,Spring Night
2901,IV,
2902,IV,"In the wondrous star-sown night,"
2903,IV,"In the first sweet warmth of spring,"
2904,IV,I lie awake and listen
2905,IV,To hear the glad earth sing.
2906,IV,
2907,IV,I hear the brook in the wood
2908,IV,"Murmuring, as it goes,"
2909,IV,The song of the happy journey
2910,IV,Only the wise heart knows.
2911,IV,
2912,IV,I hear the trilling note
2913,IV,"Of the tree-frog under the hill,"
2914,IV,And the clear and watery treble
2915,IV,"Of his brother, silvery shrill."
2916,IV,
2917,IV,And then I wander away
2918,IV,"Through the mighty forest of Sleep,"
2919,IV,To follow the fairy music
2920,IV,To the shore of an endless deep.
2921,IV,
2922,IV,
2923,IV,
2924,IV,
2925,IV,Bloodroot
2926,IV,
2927,IV,When April winds arrive
2928,IV,"And the soft rains are here,"
2929,IV,Some morning by the roadside
2930,IV,These Fairy folk appear.
2931,IV,
2932,IV,"We never see their coming,"
2933,IV,However sharp our eyes;
2934,IV,Each year as if by magic
2935,IV,They take us by surprise.
2936,IV,
2937,IV,Along the ragged woodside
2938,IV,"And by the green spring-run,"
2939,IV,Their small white heads are nodding
2940,IV,And twinkling in the sun.
2941,IV,
2942,IV,They crowd across the meadow
2943,IV,"In innocence and mirth,"
2944,IV,As if there were no sorrow
2945,IV,In all this wondrous earth.
2946,IV,
2947,IV,"So frail, so unregarded,"
2948,IV,And yet about them clings
2949,IV,"A sorcery of welcome,--"
2950,IV,The joy of common things.
2951,IV,
2952,IV,Perhaps their trail of beauty
2953,IV,Across the pasture sod
2954,IV,In jubilant procession
2955,IV,Is where an angel trod.
2956,IV,
2957,IV,
2958,IV,
2959,IV,
2960,IV,Daffodil's Return
2961,IV,
2962,IV,What matter if the sun be lost?
2963,IV,What matter though the sky be gray?
2964,IV,"There's joy enough about the house,"
2965,IV,For Daffodil comes home to-day.
2966,IV,
2967,IV,"There's news of swallows on the air,"
2968,IV,"There's word of April on the way,"
2969,IV,"They're calling flowers within the street,"
2970,IV,And Daffodil comes home to-day.
2971,IV,
2972,IV,"O who would care what fate may bring,"
2973,IV,Or what the years may take away!
2974,IV,"There's life enough within the hour,"
2975,IV,For Daffodil comes home to-day.
2976,IV,
2977,IV,
2978,IV,
2979,IV,
2980,IV,Now the Lilac Tree's in Bud
2981,IV,
2982,IV,"Now the lilac tree's in bud,"
2983,IV,And the morning birds are loud.
2984,IV,Now a stirring in the blood
2985,IV,Moves the heart of every crowd.
2986,IV,
2987,IV,Word has gone abroad somewhere
2988,IV,Of a great impending change.
2989,IV,There's a message in the air
2990,IV,Of an import glad and strange.
2991,IV,
2992,IV,"Not an idler in the street,"
2993,IV,But is better off to-day.
2994,IV,"Not a traveller you meet,"
2995,IV,But has something wise to say.
2996,IV,
2997,IV,"Now there's not a road too long,"
2998,IV,"Not a day that is not good,"
2999,IV,Not a mile but hears a song
3000,IV,Lifted from the misty wood.
3001,IV,
3002,IV,Down along the Silvermine
3003,IV,That's the blackbird's cheerful note!
3004,IV,You can see him flash and shine
3005,IV,With the scarlet on his coat.
3006,IV,
3007,IV,"Now the winds are soft with rain,"
3008,IV,"And the twilight has a spell,"
3009,IV,Who from gladness could refrain
3010,IV,Or with olden sorrows dwell?
3011,IV,
3012,IV,
3013,IV,
3014,IV,
3015,IV,White Iris
3016,IV,
3017,IV,White Iris was a princess
3018,IV,"In a kingdom long ago,"
3019,IV,Mysterious as moonlight
3020,IV,And silent as the snow.
3021,IV,
3022,IV,She drew the world in wonder
3023,IV,"And swayed it with desire,"
3024,IV,Ere Babylon was builded
3025,IV,Or a stone laid in Tyre.
3026,IV,
3027,IV,Yet here within my garden
3028,IV,"Her loveliness appears,"
3029,IV,Undimmed by any sorrow
3030,IV,Of all the tragic years.
3031,IV,
3032,IV,How kind that earth should treasure
3033,IV,So beautiful a thing--
3034,IV,"All mystical enchantment,"
3035,IV,To stir our hearts in spring!
3036,IV,
3037,IV,

3041,IV,
3042,IV,"Young foreign-born Ailanthus,"
3043,IV,"Because he grew so fast,"
3044,IV,We scorned his easy daring
3045,IV,And doubted it would last.
3046,IV,
3047,IV,"But lo, when autumn gathers"
3048,IV,"And all the woods are old,"
3049,IV,"He stands in green and salmon,"
3050,IV,A glory to behold!
3051,IV,
3052,IV,Among the ancient monarchs
3053,IV,His airy tent is spread.
3054,IV,His robe of coronation
3055,IV,Is tasseled rosy red.
3056,IV,
3057,IV,"With something strange and Eastern,"
3058,IV,His height and grace proclaim
3059,IV,His lineage and title
3060,IV,Is that celestial name.
3061,IV,
3062,IV,"This is the Tree of Heaven,"
3063,IV,"Which seems to say to us,"
3064,IV,"""Behold how rife is beauty,"
3065,IV,"And how victorious!"""

3083,IV,
3084,IV,_Astrologer and doctor
3085,IV,"In the science of his day,"

3087,IV,What more is there to say?
3088,IV,His medieval Latin
3089,IV,"Records the truth for us,"
3090,IV,Which I translate--virtutem
3091,IV,Habet occultam--thus:_
3092,IV,
3093,IV,She hath a deep-hid virtue
3094,IV,No other flower hath.
3095,IV,When summer comes rejoicing
3096,IV,"A-down my garden path,"
3097,IV,"In opulence of color,"
3098,IV,"In robe of satin sheen,"
3099,IV,She casts o'er all the hours
3100,IV,Her sorcery serene.
3101,IV,
3102,IV,"A subtile, heartening fragrance"
3103,IV,"Comes piercing the warm hush,"
3104,IV,And from the greening woodland
3105,IV,I hear the first wild thrush.
3106,IV,They move my heart to pity
3107,IV,"For all the vanished years,"
3108,IV,With ecstasy of longing
3109,IV,And tenderness of tears.
3110,IV,
3111,IV,"By many names we call her,--"
3112,IV,"Pale exquisite Aurore,"
3113,IV,Luxuriant Gismonda

3115,IV,"What matter,--Grandiflora,"
3116,IV,"A queen in some proud book,"
3117,IV,Or sweet familiar Piny
3118,IV,With her old-fashioned look?
3119,IV,
3120,IV,The crowding Apple blossoms
3121,IV,Above the orchard wall;
3122,IV,The Moonflower in August
3123,IV,When eerie nights befall;
3124,IV,"Chrysanthemum in autumn,"
3125,IV,Whose pageantries appear
3126,IV,With mystery and silence
3127,IV,To deck the dying year;

3150,IV,The Urban Pan
3151,IV,
3152,IV,Once more the magic days are come
3153,IV,With stronger sun and milder air;
3154,IV,The shops are full of daffodils;
3155,IV,There's golden leisure everywhere.
3156,IV,I heard my Lou this morning shout:
3157,IV,"""Here comes the hurdy-gurdy man!"""
3158,IV,And through the open window caught
3159,IV,The piping of the urban Pan.
3160,IV,
3161,IV,"I laid my wintry task aside,"
3162,IV,And took a day to follow joy:
3163,IV,The trail of beauty and the call
3164,IV,That lured me when I was a boy.
3165,IV,"I looked, and there looked up at me"
3166,IV,"A smiling, swarthy, hairy man"
3167,IV,With kindling eye--and well I knew
3168,IV,The piping of the urban Pan.
3169,IV,
3170,IV,He caught my mood; his hat was off;
3171,IV,I tossed the ungrudged silver down.
3172,IV,"The cunning vagrant, every year"
3173,IV,He casts his spell upon the town!
3174,IV,"And we must fling him, old and young,"
3175,IV,"Our dimes or coppers, as we can;"
3176,IV,And every heart must leap to hear
3177,IV,The piping of the urban Pan.
3178,IV,
3179,IV,"The music swells and fades again,"
3180,IV,"And I in dreams am far away,"
3181,IV,Where a bright river sparkles down
3182,IV,To meet a blue Aegean bay.
3183,IV,"There, in the springtime of the world,"
3184,IV,"Are dancing fauns, and in their van,"
3185,IV,Is one who pipes a deathless tune--
3186,IV,The earth-born and the urban Pan.
3187,IV,
3188,IV,"And so he follows down the block,"
3189,IV,"A troop of children in his train,"
3190,IV,The light-foot dancers of the street
3191,IV,Enamored of the reedy strain.
3192,IV,I hear their laughter rise and ring
3193,IV,"Above the noise of truck and van,"
3194,IV,As down the mellow wind fades out
3195,IV,The piping of the urban Pan.

3200,IV,The Sailing of the Fleets
3201,IV,
3202,IV,"Now the spring is in the town,"
3203,IV,"Now the wind is in the tree,"
3204,IV,And the wintered keels go down
3205,IV,To the calling of the sea.
3206,IV,
3207,IV,"Out from mooring, dock, and slip,"
3208,IV,"Through the harbor buoys they glide,"
3209,IV,Drawing seaward till they dip
3210,IV,To the swirling of the tide.
3211,IV,
3212,IV,"One by one and two by two,"
3213,IV,"Down the channel turns they go,"
3214,IV,Steering for the open blue
3215,IV,Where the salty great airs blow;
3216,IV,
3217,IV,"Craft of many a build and trim,"
3218,IV,"Every stitch of sail unfurled,"
3219,IV,Till they hang upon the rim
3220,IV,Of the azure ocean world.
3221,IV,
3222,IV,"Who has ever, man or boy,"
3223,IV,"Seen the sea all flecked with gold,"
3224,IV,And not longed to go with joy
3225,IV,Forth upon adventures bold?
3226,IV,
3227,IV,"Who could bear to stay indoor,"
3228,IV,"Now the wind is in the street,"
3229,IV,For the creaking of the oar
3230,IV,And the tugging of the sheet!
3231,IV,
3232,IV,"Now the spring is in the town,"
3233,IV,"Who would not a rover be,"
3234,IV,When the wintered keels go down
3235,IV,To the calling of the sea?
3236,IV,
3237,IV,
3238,IV,
3239,IV,
3240,IV,'Tis May now in New England

3242,IV,'Tis May now in New England
3243,IV,And through the open door
3244,IV,"I see the creamy breakers,"
3245,IV,I hear the hollow roar.
3246,IV,
3247,IV,Back to the golden marshes
3248,IV,"Comes summer at full tide,"
3249,IV,But not the golden comrade
3250,IV,Who was the summer's pride.
3251,IV,
3252,IV,
3253,IV,
3254,IV,
3255,IV,In Early May
3256,IV,
3257,IV,"O my dear, the world to-day"
3258,IV,Is more lovely than a dream!
3259,IV,Magic hints from far away
3260,IV,"Haunt the woodland, and the stream"
3261,IV,Murmurs in his rocky bed
3262,IV,Things that never can be said.
3263,IV,
3264,IV,"Starry dogwood is in flower,"
3265,IV,Gleaming through the mystic woods.
3266,IV,It is beauty's perfect hour
3267,IV,In the wild spring solitudes.
3268,IV,Now the orchards in full blow
3269,IV,Shed their petals white as snow.
3270,IV,
3271,IV,All the air is honey-sweet
3272,IV,"With the lilacs white and red,"
3273,IV,Where the blossoming branches meet
3274,IV,In an arbor overhead.
3275,IV,And the laden cherry trees
3276,IV,Murmur with the hum of bees.
3277,IV,
3278,IV,"All the earth is fairy green,"
3279,IV,"And the sunlight filmy gold,"
3280,IV,"Full of ecstasies unseen,"
3281,IV,Full of mysteries untold.
3282,IV,"Who would not be out-of-door,"
3283,IV,Now the spring is here once more!
3284,IV,
3285,IV,
3286,IV,
3287,IV,
3288,IV,Fireflies
3289,IV,
3290,IV,The fireflies across the dusk
3291,IV,Are flashing signals through the gloom--
3292,IV,Courageous messengers of light
3293,IV,That dare immensities of doom.
3294,IV,
3295,IV,"About the seeding meadow-grass,"
3296,IV,"Like busy watchmen in the street,"
3297,IV,"They come and go, they turn and pass,"
3298,IV,Lighting the way for Beauty's feet.
3299,IV,
3300,IV,Or up they float on viewless wings
3301,IV,"To twinkle high among the trees,"
3302,IV,And rival with soft glimmerings
3303,IV,The shining of the Pleiades.
3304,IV,
3305,IV,The stars that wheel above the hill
3306,IV,"Are not more wonderful to see,"
3307,IV,Nor the great tasks that they fulfill
3308,IV,More needed in eternity.
3309,IV,
3310,IV,
3311,IV,
3312,IV,
3313,IV,The Path to Sankoty
3314,IV,
3315,IV,It winds along the headlands
3316,IV,Above the open sea--
3317,IV,The lonely moorland footpath
3318,IV,That leads to Sankoty.
3319,IV,
3320,IV,The crooning sea spreads sailless
3321,IV,"And gray to the world's rim,"
3322,IV,Where hang the reeking fog-banks
3323,IV,Primordial and dim.
3324,IV,
3325,IV,"There fret the ceaseless currents,"
3326,IV,And the eternal tide
3327,IV,Chafes over hidden shallows
3328,IV,Where the white horses ride.
3329,IV,
3330,IV,The wistful fragrant moorlands
3331,IV,"Whose smile bids panic cease,"
3332,IV,Lie treeless and cloud-shadowed
3333,IV,In grave and lonely peace.
3334,IV,
3335,IV,"Across their flowering bosom,"
3336,IV,From the far end of day
3337,IV,Blow clean the great soft moor-winds
3338,IV,All sweet with rose and bay.
3339,IV,
3340,IV,A world as large and simple
3341,IV,"As first emerged for man,"
3342,IV,"Cleared for the human drama,"
3343,IV,Before the play began.
3344,IV,
3345,IV,O well the soul must treasure
3346,IV,The calm that sets it free--
3347,IV,"The vast and tender skyline,"
3348,IV,"The sea-turn's wizardry,"
3349,IV,
3350,IV,"Solace of swaying grasses,"
3351,IV,The friendship of sweet-fern--
3352,IV,And in the world's confusion
3353,IV,"Remembering, must yearn"
3354,IV,
3355,IV,To tread the moorland footpath
3356,IV,"That leads to Sankoty,"
3357,IV,Hearing the field-larks shrilling
3358,IV,Beside the sailless sea.
3359,IV,
3360,IV,
3361,IV,
3362,IV,
3363,IV,Off Monomoy
3364,IV,
3365,IV,Have you sailed Nantucket Sound
3366,IV,"By lightship, buoy, and bell,"
3367,IV,And lain becalmed at noon
3368,IV,On an oily summer swell?
3369,IV,
3370,IV,"Lazily drooped the sail,"
3371,IV,"Moveless the pennant hung,"
3372,IV,Sagging over the rail
3373,IV,Idle the main boom swung;
3374,IV,
3375,IV,"The sea, one mirror of shine"
3376,IV,"A single breath would destroy,"
3377,IV,Save for the far low line
3378,IV,Of treacherous Monomoy.
3379,IV,
3380,IV,"Yet eastward there toward Spain,"
3381,IV,What castled cities rise
3382,IV,"From the Atlantic plain,"
3383,IV,To our enchanted eyes!
3384,IV,
3385,IV,Turret and spire and roof
3386,IV,"Looming out of the sea,"
3387,IV,Where the prosy chart gives proof
3388,IV,No cape nor isle can be!
3389,IV,
3390,IV,Can a vision shine so clear
3391,IV,Wherein no substance dwells?
3392,IV,One almost harks to hear
3393,IV,The sound of the city's bells.
3394,IV,
3395,IV,And yet no pealing notes
3396,IV,"Within those belfries be,"
3397,IV,Save echoes from the throats
3398,IV,Of ship-bells lost at sea.
3399,IV,
3400,IV,For none shall anchor there
3401,IV,"Save those who long of yore,"
3402,IV,"When tide and wind were fair,"
3403,IV,Sailed and came back no more.
3404,IV,
3405,IV,And none shall climb the stairs
3406,IV,"Within those ghostly towers,"
3407,IV,Save those for whom sad prayers
3408,IV,Went up through fateful hours.
3409,IV,
3410,IV,"O image of the world,"
3411,IV,"O mirage of the sea,"
3412,IV,Cloud-built and foam-impearled.
3413,IV,What sorcery fashioned thee?
3414,IV,
3415,IV,"What architect of dream,"
3416,IV,"What painter of desire,"
3417,IV,Conceived that fairy scheme
3418,IV,Touched with fantastic fire?
3419,IV,
3420,IV,Even so our city of hope
3421,IV,We mortal dreamers rear
3422,IV,Upon the perilous slope
3423,IV,Above the deep of fear;
3424,IV,
3425,IV,Leaving half-known the good
3426,IV,"Our kindly earth bestows,"
3427,IV,For the feigned beatitude
3428,IV,Of a future no man knows.
3429,IV,
3430,IV,"Lord of the summer sea,"
3431,IV,"Whose tides are in thy hand,"
3432,IV,Into immensity
3433,IV,The vision at thy command
3434,IV,
3435,IV,"Fades now, and leaves no sign,--"
3436,IV,"No light nor bell nor buoy,--"
3437,IV,Only the faint low line
3438,IV,Of dangerous Monomoy.
3439,IV,
3440,IV,
3441,IV,
3442,IV,
3443,IV,In St. Germain Street
3444,IV,
3445,IV,Through the street of St. Germain
3446,IV,"March the tattered hosts of rain,"
3447,IV,
3448,IV,While the wind with vagrant fife
3449,IV,Whips their chilly ranks to life.
3450,IV,
3451,IV,From the window I can see
3452,IV,"Their ghostly banners blowing free,"
3453,IV,
3454,IV,As they pass to where the ships
3455,IV,Crowd about the wharves and slips.
3456,IV,
3457,IV,There at day's end they embark
3458,IV,"To invade the realms of dark,"
3459,IV,
3460,IV,And the sun comes out again
3461,IV,In the street of St. Germain.
3462,IV,
3463,IV,
3464,IV,
3465,IV,
3466,IV,Pan in the Catskills
3467,IV,
3468,IV,"They say that he is dead, and now no more"
3469,IV,"The reedy syrinx sounds among the hills,"
3470,IV,When the long summer heat is on the land.
3471,IV,"But I have heard the Catskill thrushes sing,"
3472,IV,"And therefore am incredulous of death,"
3473,IV,Of pain and sorrow and mortality.
3474,IV,
3475,IV,"In these blue cañons, deep with hemlock shade,"
3476,IV,"In solitudes of twilight or of dawn,"
3477,IV,I have been rapt away from time and care
3478,IV,By the enchantment of a golden strain
3479,IV,"As pure as ever pierced the Thracian wild,"
3480,IV,Filling the listener with a mute surmise.
3481,IV,
3482,IV,At evening and at morning I have gone
3483,IV,"Down the cool trail between the beech-tree boles,"
3484,IV,And heard the haunting music of the wood
3485,IV,"Ring through the silence of the dark ravine,"
3486,IV,Flooding the earth with beauty and with joy
3487,IV,And all the ardors of creation old.
3488,IV,
3489,IV,And then within my pagan heart awoke
3490,IV,Remembrance of far-off and fabled years
3491,IV,"In the untarnished sunrise of the world,"
3492,IV,When clear-eyed Hellas in her rapture heard
3493,IV,A slow mysterious piping wild and keen
3494,IV,"Thrill through her vales, and whispered, ""It is Pan!"""

3499,IV,A New England June
3500,IV,
3501,IV,_These things I remember
3502,IV,"Of New England June,"
3503,IV,Like a vivid day-dream
3504,IV,"In the azure noon,"
3505,IV,While one haunting figure
3506,IV,"Strays through every scene,"
3507,IV,Like the soul of beauty
3508,IV,Through her lost demesne._
3509,IV,
3510,IV,Gardens full of roses
3511,IV,And peonies a-blow
3512,IV,"In the dewy morning,"
3513,IV,"Row on stately row,"
3514,IV,"Spreading their gay patterns,"
3515,IV,"Crimson, pied and cream,"
3516,IV,Like some gorgeous fresco
3517,IV,Or an Eastern dream.
3518,IV,
3519,IV,Nets of waving sunlight
3520,IV,Falling through the trees;
3521,IV,Fields of gold-white daisies
3522,IV,Rippling in the breeze;
3523,IV,"Lazy lifting groundswells,"
3524,IV,Breaking green as jade
3525,IV,"On the lilac beaches,"
3526,IV,Where the shore-birds wade.
3527,IV,
3528,IV,"Orchards full of blossom,"
3529,IV,Where the bob-white calls
3530,IV,And the honeysuckle
3531,IV,Climbs the old gray walls;
3532,IV,"Groves of silver birches,"
3533,IV,"Beds of roadside fern,"
3534,IV,In the stone-fenced pasture
3535,IV,At the river's turn.
3536,IV,
3537,IV,_Out of every picture
3538,IV,Still she comes to me
3539,IV,With the morning freshness
3540,IV,"Of the summer sea,--"
3541,IV,"A glory in her bearing,"
3542,IV,"A sea-light in her eyes,"
3543,IV,As if she could not forget
3544,IV,The spell of Paradise._
3545,IV,
3546,IV,"Thrushes in the deep woods,"
3547,IV,"With their golden themes,"
3548,IV,Fluting like the choirs
3549,IV,At the birth of dreams.
3550,IV,Fireflies in the meadows
3551,IV,"At the gate of Night,"
3552,IV,With their fairy lanterns
3553,IV,Twinkling soft and bright.
3554,IV,
3555,IV,"Ah, not in the roses,"
3556,IV,"Nor the azure noon,"
3557,IV,"Nor the thrushes' music,"
3558,IV,Lies the soul of June.
3559,IV,"It is something finer,"
3560,IV,"More unfading far,"
3561,IV,Than the primrose evening
3562,IV,And the silver star;
3563,IV,
3564,IV,Something of the rapture
3565,IV,"My beloved had,"
3566,IV,When she made the morning
3567,IV,"Radiant and glad,--"
3568,IV,Something of her gracious
3569,IV,"Ecstasy of mien,"
3570,IV,"That still haunts the twilight,"
3571,IV,Loving though unseen.
3572,IV,
3573,IV,_When the ghostly moonlight
3574,IV,"Walks my garden ground,"
3575,IV,Like a leisurely patrol
3576,IV,"On his nightly round,"
3577,IV,These things I remember
3578,IV,"Of the long ago,"
3579,IV,While the slumbrous roses

3588,IV,Halts in the glowing noon!
3589,IV,The trailing shadows rest on plain and hill;
3590,IV,"The bannered hosts are still,"
3591,IV,While over forest crown and mountain head
3592,IV,The azure tent is spread.
3593,IV,
3594,IV,The song is hushed in every woodland throat;
3595,IV,Moveless the lilies float;
3596,IV,Even the ancient ever-murmuring sea
3597,IV,Sighs only fitfully;
3598,IV,The cattle drowse in the field-corner's shade;
3599,IV,Peace on the world is laid.
3600,IV,
3601,IV,"It is the hour when Nature's caravan,"
3602,IV,That bears the pilgrim Man
3603,IV,Across the desert of uncharted time
3604,IV,"To his far hope sublime,"
3605,IV,"Rests in the green oasis of the year,"
3606,IV,As if the end drew near.
3607,IV,
3608,IV,"Ah, traveller, hast thou naught of thanks or praise"
3609,IV,For these fleet halcyon days?--
3610,IV,No courage to uplift thee from despair
3611,IV,Born with the breath of prayer?
3612,IV,Then turn thee to the lilied field once more!
3613,IV,God stands in his tent door.

3623,IV,The hawk to the open sky.
3624,IV,
3625,IV,"The trout he runs to the mountain brook,"
3626,IV,The swordfish keeps the sea;
3627,IV,The brown bear knows where the blueberry grows.
3628,IV,The clover calls the bee.
3629,IV,
3630,IV,"The locust sings in the August noon,"
3631,IV,The frog in the April night;
3632,IV,"The iris loves the meadow-land,"
3633,IV,The laurel loves the height.
3634,IV,
3635,IV,And each will hold his tenure old
3636,IV,"Of earth and sun and stream,"

3648,IV,Breakers of ordered bounds.
3649,IV,
3650,IV,"If only the earth will feed us,"
3651,IV,"If only the wind be kind,"
3652,IV,"We blossom for those who need us,"
3653,IV,The stragglers left behind.
3654,IV,
3655,IV,"And lo, the Lord of the Garden,"
3656,IV,"He makes his sun to rise,"
3657,IV,And his rain to fall with pardon
3658,IV,On our dusty paradise.
3659,IV,
3660,IV,"On us he has laid the duty,--"
3661,IV,"The task of the wandering breed,--"
3662,IV,"To better the world with beauty,"
3663,IV,Wherever the way may lead.
3664,IV,
3665,IV,"Who shall inquire of the season,"
3666,IV,Or question the wind where it blows?
3667,IV,We blossom and ask no reason.
3668,IV,The Lord of the Garden knows.

3674,IV,
3675,IV,"This is a holy refuge,"

3677,IV,A fragrant altar to that peace
3678,IV,The world no longer knows.
3679,IV,
3680,IV,"Below a solemn hillside,"
3681,IV,Within the folding shade
3682,IV,Of overhanging beech and pine
3683,IV,Its walls and walks are laid.
3684,IV,
3685,IV,"Cool through the heat of summer,"
3686,IV,"Still as a sacred grove,"
3687,IV,It has the rapt unworldly air
3688,IV,Of mystery and love.
3689,IV,
3690,IV,All day before its outlook
3691,IV,"The mist-blue mountains loom,"
3692,IV,And in its trees at tranquil dusk
3693,IV,The early stars will bloom.
3694,IV,
3695,IV,Down its enchanted borders
3696,IV,"Glad ranks of color stand,"
3697,IV,Like hosts of silent seraphim
3698,IV,Awaiting love's command.
3699,IV,
3700,IV,Lovely in adoration
3701,IV,"They wait in patient line,"
3702,IV,Snow-white and purple and deep gold
3703,IV,About the rose-gold shrine.
3704,IV,
3705,IV,"And there they guard the silence,"
3706,IV,While still from her recess
3707,IV,Through sun and shade Saint Rose looks down
3708,IV,In mellow loveliness.
3709,IV,
3710,IV,"She seems to say, ""O stranger,"
3711,IV,Behold how loving care
3712,IV,"That gives its life for beauty's sake,"
3713,IV,Makes everything more fair!
3714,IV,
3715,IV,"""Then praise the Lord of gardens"

3727,IV,Some endless story of a wrong
3728,IV,The whole world must deplore.
3729,IV,
3730,IV,I heard the mountain wind
3731,IV,Conversing with the trees
3732,IV,"Of an old sorrow of the hills,"
3733,IV,Mysterious as the sea's.
3734,IV,
3735,IV,And all that haunted day
3736,IV,It seemed that I could hear
3737,IV,The echo of an ancient speech
3738,IV,Ring in my listening ear.
3739,IV,
3740,IV,"And then it came to me,"

3814,THE TRAVELLER.,
3815,THE TRAVELLER.,The Choristers
3816,THE TRAVELLER.,
3817,THE TRAVELLER.,"When earth was finished and fashioned well,"
3818,THE TRAVELLER.,There was never a musical note to tell
3819,THE TRAVELLER.,"How glad God was, save the voice of the rain"
3820,THE TRAVELLER.,And the sea and the wind on the lonely plain
3821,THE TRAVELLER.,And the rivers among the hills.
3822,THE TRAVELLER.,And so God made the marvellous birds
3823,THE TRAVELLER.,"For a choir of joy transcending words,"
3824,THE TRAVELLER.,That the world might hear and comprehend
3825,THE TRAVELLER.,How rhythm and harmony can mend
3826,THE TRAVELLER.,The spirits' hurts and ills.
3827,THE TRAVELLER.,
3828,THE TRAVELLER.,"He filled their tiny bodies with fire,"
3829,THE TRAVELLER.,"He taught them love for their chief desire,"
3830,THE TRAVELLER.,And gave them the magic of wings to be
3831,THE TRAVELLER.,"His celebrants over land and sea,"
3832,THE TRAVELLER.,Wherever man might dwell.
3833,THE TRAVELLER.,And to each he apportioned a fragment of song--
3834,THE TRAVELLER.,Those broken melodies that belong
3835,THE TRAVELLER.,"To the seraphs' chorus, that we might learn"
3836,THE TRAVELLER.,The healing of gladness and discern
3837,THE TRAVELLER.,In beauty how all is well.
3838,THE TRAVELLER.,
3839,THE TRAVELLER.,So music dwells in the glorious throats
3840,THE TRAVELLER.,"Forever, and the enchanted notes"
3841,THE TRAVELLER.,"Fall with rapture upon our ears,"
3842,THE TRAVELLER.,Moving our hearts to joy and tears
3843,THE TRAVELLER.,For things we cannot say.
3844,THE TRAVELLER.,In the wilds the whitethroat sings in the rain
3845,THE TRAVELLER.,"His pure, serene, half-wistful strain;"
3846,THE TRAVELLER.,And when twilight falls the sleeping hills
3847,THE TRAVELLER.,Ring with the cry of the whippoorwills
3848,THE TRAVELLER.,In the blue dusk far away.
3849,THE TRAVELLER.,
3850,THE TRAVELLER.,In the great white heart of the winter storm
3851,THE TRAVELLER.,"The chickadee sings, for his heart is warm,"
3852,THE TRAVELLER.,And his note is brave to rally the soul
3853,THE TRAVELLER.,From doubt and panic to self-control
3854,THE TRAVELLER.,And elation that knows no fear.
3855,THE TRAVELLER.,"The bluebird comes with the winds of March,"
3856,THE TRAVELLER.,Like a shred of sky on the naked larch;
3857,THE TRAVELLER.,The redwing follows the April rain
3858,THE TRAVELLER.,To whistle contentment back again
3859,THE TRAVELLER.,With his sturdy call of cheer.
3860,THE TRAVELLER.,
3861,THE TRAVELLER.,The orioles revel through orchard boughs
3862,THE TRAVELLER.,In their coats of gold for spring's carouse;
3863,THE TRAVELLER.,"In shadowy pastures the bobwhites call,"
3864,THE TRAVELLER.,And the flute of the thrush has a melting fall
3865,THE TRAVELLER.,Under the evening star.
3866,THE TRAVELLER.,On the verge of June when peonies blow
3867,THE TRAVELLER.,"And joy comes back to the world we know,"
3868,THE TRAVELLER.,The bobolinks fill the fields of light
3869,THE TRAVELLER.,With a tangle of music silver-bright
3870,THE TRAVELLER.,To tell how glad they are.
3871,THE TRAVELLER.,
3872,THE TRAVELLER.,The tiny warblers fill summer trees
3873,THE TRAVELLER.,With their exquisite lesser litanies;
3874,THE TRAVELLER.,The tanager in his scarlet coat
3875,THE TRAVELLER.,In the hemlock pours from a vibrant throat
3876,THE TRAVELLER.,His canticle of the sun.
3877,THE TRAVELLER.,"The loon on the lake, the hawk in the sky,"
3878,THE TRAVELLER.,"And the sea-gull--each has a piercing cry,"
3879,THE TRAVELLER.,Like outposts set in the lonely vast
3880,THE TRAVELLER.,"To cry ""all's well"" as Time goes past"
3881,THE TRAVELLER.,And another hour is gone.
3882,THE TRAVELLER.,
3883,THE TRAVELLER.,But of all the music in God's plan
3884,THE TRAVELLER.,"Of a mystical symphony for man,"
3885,THE TRAVELLER.,I shall remember best of all--
3886,THE TRAVELLER.,Whatever hereafter may befall
3887,THE TRAVELLER.,Or pass and cease to be--
3888,THE TRAVELLER.,The hermit's hymn in the solitudes
3889,THE TRAVELLER.,"Of twilight through the mountain woods,"
3890,THE TRAVELLER.,And the field-larks crying about our doors
3891,THE TRAVELLER.,On the soft sweet wind across the moors
3892,THE TRAVELLER.,At morning by the sea.
3893,THE TRAVELLER.,
3894,THE TRAVELLER.,
3895,THE TRAVELLER.,
3896,THE TRAVELLER.,
3897,THE TRAVELLER.,The Weed's Counsel
3898,THE TRAVELLER.,
3899,THE TRAVELLER.,_Said a traveller by the way
3900,THE TRAVELLER.,"Pausing, ""What hast thou to say,"

3903,THE TRAVELLER.,
3904,THE TRAVELLER.,"Traveller, hearken unto me!"
3905,THE TRAVELLER.,I will tell thee how to see
3906,THE TRAVELLER.,Beauties in the earth and sky
3907,THE TRAVELLER.,Hidden from the careless eye.
3908,THE TRAVELLER.,I will tell thee how to hear
3909,THE TRAVELLER.,"Nature's music wild and clear,--"
3910,THE TRAVELLER.,Songs of midday and of dark
3911,THE TRAVELLER.,"Such as many never mark,"
3912,THE TRAVELLER.,Lyrics of creation sung
3913,THE TRAVELLER.,Ever since the world was young.
3914,THE TRAVELLER.,
3915,THE TRAVELLER.,And thereafter thou shalt know
3916,THE TRAVELLER.,Neither weariness nor woe.
3917,THE TRAVELLER.,
3918,THE TRAVELLER.,Thou shalt see the dawn unfold
3919,THE TRAVELLER.,"Artistries of rose and gold,"
3920,THE TRAVELLER.,And the sunbeams on the sea
3921,THE TRAVELLER.,Dancing with the wind for glee.
3922,THE TRAVELLER.,The red lilies of the moors
3923,THE TRAVELLER.,"Shall be torches on the floors,"
3924,THE TRAVELLER.,Where the field-lark lifts his cry
3925,THE TRAVELLER.,"To rejoice the passer-by,"
3926,THE TRAVELLER.,In a wide world rimmed with blue
3927,THE TRAVELLER.,Lovely as when time was new.
3928,THE TRAVELLER.,
3929,THE TRAVELLER.,And thereafter thou shalt fare
3930,THE TRAVELLER.,Light of foot and free from care.
3931,THE TRAVELLER.,
3932,THE TRAVELLER.,I will teach thee how to find
3933,THE TRAVELLER.,Lost enchantments of the mind
3934,THE TRAVELLER.,"All about thee, never guessed"
3935,THE TRAVELLER.,By indifferent unrest.
3936,THE TRAVELLER.,Thy distracted thought shall learn
3937,THE TRAVELLER.,"Patience from the roadside fern,"
3938,THE TRAVELLER.,And a sweet philosophy
3939,THE TRAVELLER.,"From the flowering locust tree,--"
3940,THE TRAVELLER.,While thy heart shall not disdain
3941,THE TRAVELLER.,The consolation of the rain.
3942,THE TRAVELLER.,
3943,THE TRAVELLER.,Not an acre but shall give
3944,THE TRAVELLER.,Of its strength to help thee live.
3945,THE TRAVELLER.,
3946,THE TRAVELLER.,With the many-wintered sun
3947,THE TRAVELLER.,Shall thy hardy course be run.
3948,THE TRAVELLER.,And the bright new moon shall be
3949,THE TRAVELLER.,A lamp to thy felicity.
3950,THE TRAVELLER.,When green-mantled spring shall come
3951,THE TRAVELLER.,"Past thy door with flute and drum,"
3952,THE TRAVELLER.,And when over wood and swamp
3953,THE TRAVELLER.,"Autumn trails her scarlet pomp,"
3954,THE TRAVELLER.,"No misgiving shalt thou know,"
3955,THE TRAVELLER.,Passing glad to rise and go.
3956,THE TRAVELLER.,
3957,THE TRAVELLER.,So thy days shall be unrolled
3958,THE TRAVELLER.,Like a wondrous cloth of gold.
3959,THE TRAVELLER.,
3960,THE TRAVELLER.,When gray twilight with her star
3961,THE TRAVELLER.,"Makes a heaven that is not far,"
3962,THE TRAVELLER.,"Touched with shadows and with dreams,"
3963,THE TRAVELLER.,Thou shalt hear the woodland streams
3964,THE TRAVELLER.,Singing through the starry night
3965,THE TRAVELLER.,Holy anthems of delight.
3966,THE TRAVELLER.,So the ecstasy of earth
3967,THE TRAVELLER.,"Shall refresh thee as at birth,"
3968,THE TRAVELLER.,And thou shalt arise each morn
3969,THE TRAVELLER.,Radiant with a soul reborn.
3970,THE TRAVELLER.,
3971,THE TRAVELLER.,And this wisdom of a day
3972,THE TRAVELLER.,None shall ever take away.
3973,THE TRAVELLER.,
3974,THE TRAVELLER.,"What the secret, what the clew"
3975,THE TRAVELLER.,The wayfarer must pursue?
3976,THE TRAVELLER.,Only one thing he must have
3977,THE TRAVELLER.,Who would share these transports brave.
3978,THE TRAVELLER.,Love within his heart must dwell
3979,THE TRAVELLER.,"Like a bubbling roadside well,"
3980,THE TRAVELLER.,"For a spring to quicken thought,"
3981,THE TRAVELLER.,Else my counsel comes to naught.
3982,THE TRAVELLER.,For without that quickening trust
3983,THE TRAVELLER.,We are less than roadside dust.
3984,THE TRAVELLER.,
3985,THE TRAVELLER.,"This, O traveller, is my creed,--"
3986,THE TRAVELLER.,All the wisdom of the weed!
3987,THE TRAVELLER.,
3988,THE TRAVELLER.,_Then the traveller set his pack

4054,THE TRAVELLER.,The cattle huddle together;
4055,THE TRAVELLER.,Indoors the farmer runs;
4056,THE TRAVELLER.,And the first shot lashes the pane.
4057,THE TRAVELLER.,
4058,THE TRAVELLER.,They charge through the quiet orchard;
4059,THE TRAVELLER.,One pear tree is snapped like a wand;
4060,THE TRAVELLER.,"As they sweep from the shattered hillside,"
4061,THE TRAVELLER.,"Ruffling the blackened pond,"

4086,THE TRAVELLER.,"Day after day they are dancing,"
4087,THE TRAVELLER.,Never a moment sad.
4088,THE TRAVELLER.,
4089,THE TRAVELLER.,But when through the field of heaven

5921,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Of the World-mother,"
5922,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Brooding below the storms
5923,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Of human madness,"
5924,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Can know what desolate
5925,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Anguish possessed her.
5926,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
5927,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Only the far mind
5928,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Of the World-father,"
5929,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Seeing the mystic
5930,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"End and beginning,"
5931,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Knows why the pageant
5932,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Is so betattered
5933,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),With mortal sorrow.
5934,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
5935,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
5936,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
5937,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
5938,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),On the Plaza
5939,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
5940,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),One August day I sat beside
5941,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),A café window open wide
5942,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),To let the shower-freshened air
5943,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Blow in across the Plaza, where"
5944,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),In golden pomp against the dark
5945,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Green leafy background of the Park,"
5946,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"St. Gaudens' hero, gaunt and grim,"
5947,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Rides on with Victory leading him.
5948,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
5949,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The wet, black asphalt seemed to hold"
5950,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"In every hollow pools of gold,"
5951,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),And clouds of gold and pink and gray
5952,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Were piled up at the end of day,"
5953,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Far down the cross street, where one tower"
5954,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Still glistened from the drenching shower.
5955,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
5956,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"A weary, white-haired man went by,"
5957,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Cooling his forehead gratefully
5958,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"After the day's great heat.  A girl,"
5959,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Her thin white garments in a swirl
5960,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Blown back against her breasts and knees,"
5961,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Like a Winged Victory in the breeze,"
5962,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Alive and modern and superb,"
5963,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Crossed from the circle of the curb.
5964,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
5965,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"We sat there watching people pass,"
5966,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Clinking the ice against the glass
5967,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And talking idly--books or art,"
5968,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Or something equally apart
5969,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),From the essential stress and strife
5970,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"That rudely form and further life,"
5971,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Glad of a respite from the heat,"
5972,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"When down the middle of the street,"
5973,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Trundling a hurdy-gurdy, gay"
5974,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"In spite of the dull-stifling day,"
5975,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Three street-musicians came.  The man,"
5976,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"With hair and beard as black as Pan,"
5977,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Strolled on one side with lordly grace,"
5978,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),While a young girl tugged at a trace
5979,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Upon the other.  And between
5980,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The shafts there walked a laughing queen,"
5981,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Bright as a poppy, strong and free."
5982,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),What likelier land than Italy
5983,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Breeds such abandon?  Confident
5984,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),And rapturous in mere living spent
5985,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Each moment to the utmost, there"
5986,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"With broad, deep chest and kerchiefed hair,"
5987,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"With head thrown back, bare throat, and waist"
5988,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Supple, heroic and free-laced,"
5989,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Between her two companions walked
5990,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"This splendid woman, chaffed and talked,"
5991,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Did half the work, made all the cheer"
5992,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Of that small company.
5993,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
5994,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),No fear
5995,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Of failure in a soul like hers
5996,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),That every moment throbs and stirs
5997,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"With merry ardor, virile hope,"
5998,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Brave effort, nor in all its scope"
5999,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Has room for thought or discontent,"
6000,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Each day its own sufficient vent
6001,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),And source of happiness.
6002,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6003,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Without
6004,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),A trace of bitterness or doubt
6005,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Of life's true worth, she strode at ease"
6006,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Before those empty palaces,"
6007,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),A simple heiress of the earth
6008,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And all its joys by happy birth,"
6009,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Beneficent as breeze or dew,"
6010,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),And fresh as though the world were new
6011,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),And toil and grief were not.  How rare
6012,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),A personality was there!
6013,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6014,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6015,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6016,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6017,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),A Painter's Holiday
6018,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6019,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),We painters sometimes strangely keep
6020,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),These holidays.  When life runs deep
6021,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And broad and strong, it comes to make"
6022,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Its own bright-colored almanack.
6023,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Impulse and incident divine
6024,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Must find their way through tone and line;
6025,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),The throb of color and the dream
6026,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Of beauty, giving art its theme"
6027,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"From dear life's daily miracle,"
6028,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Illume the artist's life as well.
6029,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"A bird-note, or a turning leaf,"
6030,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The first white fall of snow, a brief"
6031,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Wild song from the Anthology,"
6032,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"A smile, or a girl's kindling eye,--"
6033,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),And there is worth enough for him
6034,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),To make the page of history dim.
6035,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Who knows upon what day may come
6036,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),The touch of that delirium
6037,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Which lifts plain life to the divine,"
6038,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),And teaches hand the magic line
6039,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"No cunning rule could ever reach,"
6040,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Where Soul's necessities find speech?
6041,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),None knows how rapture may arrive
6042,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"To be our helper, and survive"
6043,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Through our essay to help in turn
6044,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),All starving eager souls who yearn
6045,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Lightward discouraged and distraught.
6046,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Ah, once art's gleam of glory caught"
6047,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And treasured in the heart, how then"
6048,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"We walk enchanted among men,"
6049,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),And with the elder gods confer!
6050,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"So art is hope's interpreter,"
6051,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),And with devotion must conspire
6052,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),To fan the eternal altar fire.
6053,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Wherefore you find me here to-day,"
6054,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Not idling the good hours away,"
6055,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),But picturing a magic hour
6056,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),With its replenishment of power.
6057,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6058,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Conceive a bleak December day,"
6059,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The streets all mire, the sky all gray,"
6060,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),And a poor painter trudging home
6061,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Disconsolate, when what should come"
6062,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Across his vision, but a line"
6063,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"On a bold-lettered play-house sign,"
6064,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),_A Persian Sun Dance_.
6065,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6066,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),In he turns.
6067,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"A step, and there the desert burns"
6068,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Purple and splendid; molten gold
6069,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The streamers of the dawn unfold,"
6070,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Amber and amethyst uphurled
6071,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Above the far rim of the world;
6072,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),The long-held sound of temple bells
6073,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Over the hot sand steals and swells;
6074,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),A lazy tom-tom throbs and dones
6075,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),In barbarous maddening monotones;
6076,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),While sandal incense blue and keen
6077,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Hangs in the air.  And then the scene
6078,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Wakes, and out steps, by rhythm released,"
6079,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The sorcery of all the East,"
6080,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"In rose and saffron gossamer,--"
6081,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),A young light-hearted worshipper
6082,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Who dances up the sun.  She moves
6083,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Like waking woodland flower that loves
6084,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"To greet the day.  Her lithe, brown curve"
6085,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Is like a sapling's sway and swerve
6086,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Before the spring wind.  Her dark hair
6087,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Framing a face vivid and rare,"
6088,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Curled to her throat and then flew wild,"
6089,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Like shadows round a radiant child.
6090,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),The sunlight from her cymbals played
6091,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"About her dancing knees, and made"
6092,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"A world of rose-lit ecstasy,"
6093,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Prophetic of the day to be.
6094,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6095,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Such mystic beauty might have shone
6096,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"In Sardis or in Babylon,"
6097,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),To bring a Satrap to his doom
6098,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Or touch some lad with glory's bloom.
6099,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And now it wrought for me, with sheer"
6100,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Enchantment of the dying year,"
6101,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Its irresistible reprieve
6102,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),From joylessness on New Year's Eve.
6103,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6104,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6105,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6106,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6107,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Mirage
6108,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6109,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Here hangs at last, you see, my row"
6110,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Of sketches,--all I have to show"
6111,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Of one enchanted summer spent
6112,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"In sweet laborious content,"
6113,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"At little 'Sconset by the moors,"
6114,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"With the sea thundering by its doors,"
6115,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Its grassy streets, and gardens gay"
6116,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),With hollyhocks and salvia.
6117,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6118,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And here upon the easel yet,"
6119,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"With the last brush of paint still wet,"
6120,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"(Showing how inspiration toils),"
6121,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Is one where the white surf-line boils
6122,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Along the sand, and the whole sea"
6123,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Lifts to the skyline, just to be"
6124,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),The wondrous background from whose verge
6125,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Of blue on blue there should emerge
6126,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),This miracle.
6127,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6128,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),One day of days
6129,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),I strolled the silent path that strays
6130,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Between the moorlands and the beach
6131,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"From Siasconset, till you reach"
6132,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Tom Nevers Head, the lone last land"
6133,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"That fronts the ocean, lone and grand"
6134,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),As when the Lord first bade it be
6135,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),For a surprise and mystery.
6136,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"A sailless sea, a cloudless sky,"
6137,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The level lonely moors, and I"
6138,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),The only soul in all that vast
6139,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Of color made intense to last!
6140,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),The small white sea-birds piping near;
6141,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),The great soft moor-winds; and the dear
6142,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Bright sun that pales each crest to jade,"
6143,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Where gulls glint fishing unafraid.
6144,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6145,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Here man, the godlike, might have gone"
6146,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"With his deep thought, on that wild dawn"
6147,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"When the first sun came from the sea,"
6148,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Glowing and kindling the world to be,"
6149,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"While time began and joy had birth,--"
6150,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),No wilder sweeter spot on earth!
6151,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6152,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),As I sat there and mused (the way
6153,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"We painters waste our time, you say!)"
6154,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),On the sheer loneliness and strength
6155,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Whence life must spring, there came at length"
6156,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Conviction of the helplessness
6157,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Of earth alone to ban or bless.
6158,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),I saw the huge unhuman sea;
6159,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),I heard the drear monotony
6160,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Of the waves beating on the shore
6161,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"With heedless, futile strife and roar,"
6162,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Without a meaning or an aim.
6163,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6164,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And then a revelation came,"
6165,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"In subtle, sudden, lovely guise,"
6166,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Like one of those soft mysteries
6167,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Of Indian jugglers, who evoke"
6168,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),A flower for you out of smoke.
6169,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),I knew sheer beauty without soul
6170,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Could never be perfection's goal,"
6171,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Nor satisfy the seeking mind
6172,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),With all it longs for and must find
6173,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),One day.  The lovely things that haunt
6174,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Our senses with an aching want,"
6175,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And move our souls, are like the fair"
6176,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Lost garments of a soul somewhere.
6177,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Nature is naught, if not the veil"
6178,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Of some great good that must prevail
6179,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And break in joy, as woods of spring"
6180,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Break into song and blossoming.
6181,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6182,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),But what makes that great goodness start
6183,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Within ourselves?  When leaps the heart
6184,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"With gladness, only then we know"
6185,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Why lovely Nature travails so,--"
6186,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Why art must persevere and pray
6187,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),In her incomparable way.
6188,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),In all the world the only worth
6189,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Is human happiness; its dearth
6190,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The darkest ill.  Let joyance be,"
6191,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And there is God's sufficiency,--"
6192,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Such joy as only can abound
6193,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Where the heart's comrade has been found.
6194,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6195,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),That was my thought.  And then the sea
6196,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Broke in upon my revery
6197,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"With clamorous beauty,--the superb"
6198,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Eternal noun that takes no verb
6199,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),But love.  The heaven of dove-like blue
6200,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Bent o'er the azure, round and true"
6201,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"As magic sphere of crystal glass,"
6202,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Where faith sees plain the pageant pass
6203,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Of things unseen.  So I beheld
6204,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The sheer sky-arches domed and belled,"
6205,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),As if the sea were the very floor
6206,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Of heaven where walked the gods of yore
6207,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"In Plato's imagery, and I"
6208,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Uplifted saw their pomps go by.
6209,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6210,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),The House of space and time grew tense
6211,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"As if with rapture's imminence,"
6212,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"When truth should be at last made clear,"
6213,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),And the great worth of life appear;
6214,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"While I, a worshipper at the shrine,"
6215,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"For very longing grew divine,"
6216,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Borne upward on earth's ecstasy,"
6217,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),And welcomed by the boundless sky.
6218,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6219,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),A mighty prescience seemed to brood
6220,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Over that tenuous solitude
6221,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Yearning for form, till it became"
6222,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Vivid as dream and live as flame,"
6223,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Through magic art could never match,"
6224,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The vision I have tried to catch,--"
6225,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),All earth's delight and meaning grown
6226,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),A lyric presence loved and known.
6227,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6228,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),How otherwise could time evolve
6229,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Young courage, or the high resolve,"
6230,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Or gladness to assuage and bless
6231,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The soul's austere great loneliness,"
6232,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Than by providing her somehow
6233,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"With sympathy of hand and brow,"
6234,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And bidding her at last go free,"
6235,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Companioned through eternity?
6236,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6237,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"So there appeared before my eyes,"
6238,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"In a beloved, familiar guise,"
6239,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"A vivid, questing human face"
6240,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"In profile, scanning heaven for grace,"
6241,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Up-gazing there against the blue
6242,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),With eyes that heaven itself shone through;
6243,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The lips soft-parted, half in prayer,"
6244,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Half confident of kindness there;
6245,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),A brow like Plato's made for dream
6246,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"In some immortal Academe,"
6247,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),And tender as a happy girl's;
6248,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),A full dark head of clustered curls
6249,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Round as an emperor's, where meet"
6250,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Repose and ardor, strong and sweet,"
6251,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Distilling from a mind unmarred
6252,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),The glory of her rapt regard.
6253,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6254,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"So eager Mary might have stood,"
6255,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"In love's adoring attitude,"
6256,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),And looked into the angel's eyes
6257,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"With faith and fearlessness, all wise"
6258,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"In soul's unfaltering innocence,"
6259,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Sure in her woman's supersense
6260,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Of things only the humble know.
6261,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),My vision looks forever so.
6262,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6263,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"In other years when men shall say,"
6264,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"""What was the painter's meaning, pray?"
6265,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Why all this vast of sea and space,"
6266,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Just to enframe a woman's face?"""
6267,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Here is the pertinent reply,"
6268,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"""What better use for earth and sky?"""
6269,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6270,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),The great archangel passed that way
6271,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Illuming life with mystic ray.
6272,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Not Lippo's self nor Raphael
6273,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Had lovelier, realer things to tell"
6274,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Than I, beholding far away"
6275,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),How all the melting rose and gray
6276,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Upon the purple sea-line leaned
6277,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),About that head that intervened.
6278,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6279,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"How real was she?  Ah, my friend,"
6280,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),In art the fact and fancy blend
6281,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Past telling.  All the painter's task
6282,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Is with the glory.  Need we ask
6283,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),The tulips breaking through the mould
6284,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"To their untarnished age of gold,"
6285,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Whence their ideals were derived
6286,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),That have so gloriously survived?
6287,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Flowers and painters both must give
6288,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The hint they have received, to live,--"
6289,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Spend without stint the joy and power
6290,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"That lurk in each propitious hour,--"
6291,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Yet leave the why untold--God's way.

6321,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Our love, our valor and our youth."
6322,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Are there no honors for these things
6323,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),To match the pageantries of kings?
6324,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Are we more laggard in the race
6325,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Than those who fell at Samothrace?

6345,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),With all the ease and splendid poise

6347,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Wilt thou not teach us to attain
6348,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Thy sense of power without strain,"
6349,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),That we a little may possess
6350,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Our souls with thy sure loveliness,--"

6415,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Is still most deeply loved and gladly praised.
6416,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6417,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),For he who conquered with so strong a hand
6418,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Cabul, Kashmir, and Kandahar, and Sind,"

6421,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Upholding justice with his sovereignty

6436,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"To Agra and his court's magnificence,"
6437,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"From a campaign against some turbulent folk,"
6438,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),He came at evening to a quiet place
6439,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Near Sikri by the roadside through the woods,"
6440,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Where there were many doves among the trees.
6441,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6442,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),There Salim Chisti a holy man had made
6443,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"His lonely dwelling in the wilderness,"
6444,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Seeking perfection.  And the solitude
6445,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Was sweet to Akbar, and he halted there"
6446,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And went to Salim in his lodge and said,"
6447,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"""O man and brother, thy long days are spent"
6448,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"In meditation, seeking for the path"
6449,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Through this great world's impediments to peace,"
6450,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Here in the twilight with the holy stars
6451,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Or when the rose of morning breaks in gold;
6452,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Tell me, I pray, whence comes the gift of peace"
6453,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"With all its blessings for a people's need,"
6454,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),And how may true tranquillity be found
6455,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"On which man's restless spirit longs to rest?"""
6456,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6457,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And Salim answered, ""Lord, most readily"
6458,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"In Allah's out-of-doors, for there men live"
6459,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"More truly, being free from false constraint,"
6460,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),For learning wisdom with a calmer mind.
6461,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),For they who would find peace must conquer fear
6462,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And ignorance and greed,--the ravagers"
6463,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Of spirit, mind, and sense,--and learn to live"
6464,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Content beneath the shade of Allah's hand.
6465,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Who worships not his own will shall find peace."""
6466,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6467,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Then Akbar answered, ""I have set my heart"
6468,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"On making beauty, truth, and justice shine"
6469,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),As the ordered stars above the darkened earth.
6470,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Are not these also things to be desired,"
6471,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),And striven for with no uncertain toil?
6472,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And save through them whence comes the gift of peace?"""
6473,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6474,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Then Salim smiled, and with his finger drew"
6475,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"In the soft dust before his door, and said,"
6476,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"""O king, thy words are true, thy heart most wise."
6477,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Thou also shalt find peace, as Allah wills,"
6478,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Through following bravely what to thee seems best.
6479,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"When any question, 'What is peace?' reply,"
6480,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"'The shelter of the Gate of Paradise,"
6481,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The shadow of the archway, not the arch,"
6482,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Within whose shade at need the poor may rest,"
6483,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The weary be refreshed, the weak secure,"
6484,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And all men pause to gladden as they go.'"""
6485,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6486,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),And Akbar pondered Salim Chisti's words.
6487,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Then turning to his ministers, he said,"
6488,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"""Here will I build my capital, and here"
6489,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The world shall come unto a council hall,"
6490,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),And in a place of peace pursue the quest
6491,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Of wisdom and the finding out of truth,"
6492,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"That there be no more discord upon earth,"
6493,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"But only knowledge, beauty, and good will."""
6494,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6495,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),And it was done according to Akbar's word.
6496,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),There in the wilderness as by magic rose
6497,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Futtehpur Sikri, the victorious city,"
6498,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Of marble and red sandstone among the trees,"
6499,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),A rose unfolding in the kindling dawn.
6500,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Palace and mosque and garden and serai,"
6501,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Bazaars and baths and spacious pleasure grounds,"
6502,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),By favor of Allah to perfection sprang.
6503,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6504,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Thus Akbar wrought to make his dream come true.
6505,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),From the four corners of the world he brought
6506,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"His master workmen, from Iran and Ind,"
6507,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),From wild Mongolia and the Arabian wastes;
6508,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Masons from Bagdad, Delhi, and Multan;"
6509,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Dome builders from the North, from Samarkand;"
6510,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Cunning mosaic workers from Kanauj;
6511,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),And carvers of inscriptions from Shiraz;
6512,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And they all labored with endearing skill,"
6513,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Each at his handicraft, to make beauty be."
6514,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6515,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"When the first ax-blade on the timber rang,"
6516,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The timid doves, as if foreboding ill,"
6517,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Had fled from Sikri and its quiet groves.
6518,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6519,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"But as he promised, Akbar sent and bade"
6520,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The wise men of all nations to his court,"
6521,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Brahman and Christian, Buddhist and Parsee,"
6522,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Jain and stiff Mohammedan and Jew,"
6523,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"All followers of the One with many names,"
6524,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Bringing the ghostly wisdom of the earth.
6525,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6526,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),And so they came of every hue and creed.
6527,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),From the twelve winds of heaven their caravans
6528,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Drew into Sikri as Akbar summoned them,"
6529,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"To spend long afternoons in council grave,"
6530,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Sifting tradition for the seed of truth,"
6531,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),In the great mosque in Futtehpur at peace.
6532,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And Salim Chisti lived his holy life,"
6533,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Beloved and honored there as Akbar's friend.
6534,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6535,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),But light and changeable are the hearts of men.
6536,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Soon in that city dedicate to peace
6537,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Dissensions spread and rivalries grew rife,"
6538,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Envy and bitterness and strife returned
6539,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Once more, and truth before them fled away."
6540,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Then Salim Chisti, coming to Akbar spoke,"
6541,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"""Lord, give thy servant leave now to depart"
6542,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And follow where the fluttered wings have gone,"
6543,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"For here there is no longer any peace,"
6544,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And truth cannot prevail where discord dwells."""
6545,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6546,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"""Nay then,"" said Akbar, ""'tis not thou but I"
6547,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Who am the servant here and must go hence.
6548,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"I found thee master of this solitude,"
6549,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Lord of the princedom of a quiet mind,"
6550,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"A sovereign vested in tranquillity,"
6551,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),And I have done thee wrong and stayed thy feet
6552,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"From following perfection, with my horde"
6553,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Of turbulent malcontents; and my loved dream
6554,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),To build a city of abiding peace
6555,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Was but a vain illusion.  Therefore now
6556,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),This foolish people shall be driven forth
6557,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"From this fair place, to live as they may choose"
6558,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"In disputance and wrangling longer still,"
6559,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Until they learn, if Allah wills it so,"
6560,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"To lay aside their folly for the truth."""
6561,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6562,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And as the king commanded, so it was."
6563,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"More quickly than he came, with all his court"
6564,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And hosts of followers he went away,"
6565,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Leaving the place to solitude once more,--"
6566,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),A rose to wither where it once had blown.
6567,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6568,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),To-day the all-kind unpolluted sun
6569,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Shines through the marble fret-work with no sound;
6570,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),The winds play hide and seek through corridors
6571,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Where stately women with dark glowing eyes
6572,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Have laughed and frolicked in their fluttering robes;
6573,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The rose leaves drop with none to gather them,"
6574,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"In gardens where no footfall comes with eve,"
6575,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Nor any lovers watch the rising moon;
6576,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And ancient silence, truer than all speech,"
6577,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Still holds the secrets of the Council Hall,"
6578,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Upon whose walls frescoes of many faiths
6579,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Attest the courtesy of open minds.
6580,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),
6581,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Before the last camp-follower was gone,"
6582,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),The doves returned and took up their abode
6583,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),In the main gate of those deserted walls.
6584,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And in their custody this ""Gate of Peace"""

6589,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),The magic hush of those forsaken streets
