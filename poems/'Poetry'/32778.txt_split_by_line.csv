137,WINTER IN CASTILE,The promiscuous wind wafts idly from the quays
138,WINTER IN CASTILE,A smell of ships and curious woods and casks
139,WINTER IN CASTILE,And a sweetness from the gorse on the flowerstand
140,WINTER IN CASTILE,And brushes with his cool careless cheek the cheeks
141,WINTER IN CASTILE,"Of those on the street; mine, an old gnarled man's,"
142,WINTER IN CASTILE,The powdered cheeks of the girl who with faded eyes

151,I,I
152,I,
153,I,A long grey street with balconies.
154,I,Above the gingercolored grocer's shop
155,I,trail pink geraniums
156,I,and further up a striped mattress
157,I,hangs from a window
158,I,and the little wooden cage
159,I,of a goldfinch.
160,I,
161,I,Four blind men wabble down the street
162,I,with careful steps on the rounded cobbles
163,I,scraping with violin and flute
164,I,the interment of a tune.
165,I,
166,I,People gather:
167,I,women with market-baskets
168,I,"stuffed with green vegetables,"
169,I,men with blankets on their shoulders
170,I,and brown sunwrinkled faces.
171,I,
172,I,"Pipe the flutes, squeak the violins;"
173,I,four blind men in a row
174,I,at the interment of a tune ...
175,I,But on the plate
176,I,coppers clink
177,I,round brown pennies
178,I,"a merry music at the funeral,"
179,I,penny swigs of wine
180,I,penny gulps of gin
181,I,peanuts and hot roast potatoes
182,I,red disks of sausage
183,I,tripe steaming in the corner shop ...
184,I,
185,I,And overhead
186,I,the sympathetic finch
187,I,chirps and trills
188,I,approval.

194,II,
195,II,A boy with rolled up shirtsleeves
196,II,turns the handle.
197,II,"Grind, grind."
198,II,The black sphere whirls
199,II,above a charcoal fire.
200,II,"Grind, grind."
201,II,The boy sweats and grits his teeth and turns
202,II,while a man blows up the coals.
203,II,"Grind, grind."
204,II,"Thicker comes the blue curling smoke,"
205,II,the moka-scented smoke
206,II,heavy with early morning
207,II,and the awakening city
208,II,with click-clack click-clack on the cobblestones
209,II,and the young winter sunshine
210,II,advancing inquisitively
211,II,across the black and white tiles of my bedroom floor.
212,II,"Grind, grind."
213,II,The coffee is done.
214,II,"The boy rubs his arms and yawns,"
215,II,and the sphere and the furnace are trundled away
216,II,to be set up at another café.
217,II,
218,II,A poor devil
219,II,whose dirty ashen white body shows through his rags
220,II,sniffs sensually
221,II,with dilated nostrils
222,II,"the heavy coffee-fragrant smoke,"
223,II,and turns to sleep again
224,II,in the feeble sunlight of the greystone steps.

229,III,III
230,III,
231,III,"Women are selling tuberoses in the square,"
232,III,and sombre-tinted wreaths
233,III,stiffly twined and crinkly
234,III,for this is the day of the dead.
235,III,
236,III,Women are selling tuberoses in the square.
237,III,Their velvet odor fills the street
238,III,somehow stills the tramp of feet;
239,III,for this is the day of the dead.
240,III,
241,III,Their presence is heavy about us
242,III,like the velvet black scent of the flowers:
243,III,"incense of pompous interments,"
244,III,"patter of monastic feet,"
245,III,drone of masses drowsily said
246,III,for the thronging dead.
247,III,
248,III,
249,III,Women are selling tuberoses in the square
250,III,to cover the tombs of the envious dead
251,III,and shroud them again in the lethean scent
252,III,lest the dead should remember.

257,IV,IV
258,IV,
259,IV,Above the scuffling footsteps of crowds
260,IV,the clang of trams
261,IV,the shouts of newsboys
262,IV,"the stridence of wheels,"
263,IV,"very calm,"
264,IV,floats the sudden trill of a pipe
265,IV,three silvery upward notes
266,IV,"wistfully quavering,"
267,IV,notes a Thessalian shepherd might have blown
268,IV,to call his sheep
269,IV,in the emerald shade
270,IV,"of Tempe,"
271,IV,notes that might have waked the mad women sleeping
272,IV,among pinecones in the hills
273,IV,and stung them to headlong joy
274,IV,"of the presence of their mad Iacchos,"
275,IV,notes like the glint of sun
276,IV,making jaunty the dark waves of Tempe.
277,IV,
278,IV,In the street an old man is passing
279,IV,wrapped in a dun brown mantle
280,IV,blowing with bearded lips on a shining panpipe
281,IV,while he trundles before him
282,IV,a grindstone.
283,IV,
284,IV,The scissors grinder.

290,V,
291,V,Rain slants on an empty square.
292,V,
293,V,Across the expanse of cobbles
294,V,rides an old shawl-muffled woman
295,V,black on a donkey with pert ears
296,V,that places carefully
297,V,his tiny sharp hoofs
298,V,as if the cobbles were eggs.
299,V,The paniers are full
300,V,of bright green lettuces
301,V,"and purple cabbages,"
302,V,"and shining red bellshaped peppers,"
303,V,"dripping, shining, a band in marchtime,"
304,V,"in the grey rain,"
305,V,in the grey city.

312,BEGGARS,
313,BEGGARS,"The fountain some dead king put up,"
314,BEGGARS,"conceived in pompous imageries,"
315,BEGGARS,piled with mossgreened pans and centaurs
316,BEGGARS,topped by a prudish tight-waisted Cybele
317,BEGGARS,(Cybele the many-breasted mother of the grain)
318,BEGGARS,spurts with a solemn gurgle of waters.
319,BEGGARS,
320,BEGGARS,Where the sun is warmest
321,BEGGARS,their backs against the greystone basin
322,BEGGARS,"sit, hoarding every moment of the palefaced sun,"
323,BEGGARS,(thy children Cybele)
324,BEGGARS,Pan a bearded beggar with blear eyes;
325,BEGGARS,"his legs were withered by a papal bull,"
326,BEGGARS,those shaggy legs so nimble to pursue
327,BEGGARS,through groves of Arcadian myrtle
328,BEGGARS,the nymphs of the fountains and valleys;
329,BEGGARS,a young Faunus with soft brown face
330,BEGGARS,and dirty breast bared to the sun;
331,BEGGARS,the black hair crisps about his ears
332,BEGGARS,with some grace yet;
333,BEGGARS,a little barefoot Eros
334,BEGGARS,crouching to scratch his skinny thighs
335,BEGGARS,who stares with wide gold eyes aghast
336,BEGGARS,at the yellow shiny trams that clatter past.
337,BEGGARS,
338,BEGGARS,All day long they doze in the scant sun
339,BEGGARS,and watch the wan leaves rustle to the ground
340,BEGGARS,from the yellowed limetrees of the avenue.
341,BEGGARS,They are still thine Cybele
342,BEGGARS,nursed at thy breast;
343,BEGGARS,(like a woman's last foster-children
344,BEGGARS,that still would suck grey withered dugs).
345,BEGGARS,They have not scorned thy dubious bounty
346,BEGGARS,for stridence of grinding iron
347,BEGGARS,and pale caged lives
348,BEGGARS,made blind by the dust of toil
349,BEGGARS,to coin the very sun to gold.

354,VII,VII
355,VII,
356,VII,Footsteps
357,VII,and the leisurely patter of rain.
358,VII,
359,VII,Beside the lamppost in the alley
360,VII,stands a girl in a long sleek shawl
361,VII,that moulds vaguely to the curves
362,VII,of breast and arms.
363,VII,Her eyes are in shadow.
364,VII,
365,VII,A smell of frying fish;
366,VII,footsteps of people going to dinner
367,VII,clatter eagerly through the lane.
368,VII,A boy with a trough of meat on his shoulder
369,VII,"turns by the lamppost,"
370,VII,his steps drag.
371,VII,The green light slants
372,VII,in the black of his eyes.
373,VII,Her eyes are in shadow.
374,VII,
375,VII,Footsteps of people going to dinner
376,VII,clatter eagerly; the rain
377,VII,falls with infinite nonchalance ...
378,VII,a man turns with a twirl of moustaches
379,VII,and the green light slants on his glasses
380,VII,on the round buttons of his coat.
381,VII,Her eyes are in shadow.
382,VII,
383,VII,A woman with an umbrella
384,VII,keeps her eyes straight ahead
385,VII,and lifts her dress
386,VII,to avoid the mud on the pavingstones.
387,VII,
388,VII,An old man stares without fear
389,VII,into the eyes of the girl
390,VII,through the stripes of the rain.
391,VII,His steps beat faster and he sniffs hard suddenly
392,VII,the smell of dinner and frying fish.
393,VII,Was it a flame of old days
394,VII,"expanding in his cold blood,"
395,VII,"or a shiver of rigid graves,"
396,VII,chill clay choking congealing?
397,VII,
398,VII,Beside the lamppost in the alley
399,VII,stands a girl in a long sleek shawl
400,VII,that moulds vaguely to the curves
401,VII,of breast and arms.

407,VIII,
408,VIII,A brown net of branches
409,VIII,quivers above silver trunks of planes.
410,VIII,Here and there
411,VIII,a late leaf flutters
412,VIII,its faint death-rattle in the wind.
413,VIII,"Beyond, the sky burns fervid rose"
414,VIII,like red wine held against the sun.
415,VIII,
416,VIII,Schoolboys are playing in the square
417,VIII,dodging among the silver tree-trunks
418,VIII,collars gleam and white knees
419,VIII,as they romp shrilly.
420,VIII,
421,VIII,Lamps bloom out one by one
422,VIII,"like jessamine, yellow and small."
423,VIII,At the far end a church's dome
424,VIII,flat deep purple cuts the sky.
425,VIII,
426,VIII,Schoolboys are romping in the square
427,VIII,in and out among the silver tree-trunks
428,VIII,out of the smoked rose shadows
429,VIII,through the timid yellow lamplight ...
430,VIII,Socks slip down
431,VIII,fingermarks smudge white collars;
432,VIII,they run and tussle in the shadows
433,VIII,kicking the gravel with muddied boots
434,VIII,with cheeks flushed hotter than the sky
435,VIII,eyes brighter than the street-lamps
436,VIII,with fingers tingling and breath fast:
437,VIII,banqueters early drunken
438,VIII,on the fierce cold wine of the dead year.

444,IX,
445,IX,Green against the livid sky
446,IX,in their square dun-colored towers
447,IX,hang the bronze bells of Castile.
448,IX,In their unshakeable square towers
449,IX,jutting from the slopes of hills
450,IX,clang the bells of all the churches
451,IX,the dustbrown churches of Castile.
452,IX,
453,IX,How they swing the green bronze bells
454,IX,athwart olive twilights of Castile
455,IX,till their fierce insistant clangour
456,IX,rings down the long plowed slopes
457,IX,breaks against the leaden hills
458,IX,whines among the trembling poplars
459,IX,beside sibilant swift green rivers.
460,IX,
461,IX,O you strong bells of Castile
462,IX,that commanding clang your creed
463,IX,over treeless fields and villages
464,IX,"that huddle in arroyos, gleaming"
465,IX,orange with lights in the greenish dusk;
466,IX,"can it be bells of Castile,"
467,IX,can it be that you remember?
468,IX,
469,IX,Groans there in your bronze green curves
470,IX,in your imperious evocation
471,IX,"stench of burnings, rattling screams"
472,IX,quenched among the crackling flames?
473,IX,"The crowd, the pile of faggots in the square,"
474,IX,the yellow robes.... Is it that
475,IX,bells of Castile that you remember?

482,X,The Tagus flows with a noise of wiers through Aranjuez.
483,X,The speeding dark-green water mirrors the old red walls
484,X,and the balustrades and close-barred windows of the palace;
485,X,and on the other bank three stooping washerwomen
486,X,"whose bright red shawls and piles of linen gleam in the green,"
487,X,the swirling green where shimmer the walls of Aranjuez.
488,X,
489,X,There's smoke in the gardens of Aranjuez
490,X,smoke of the burning of the years' dead leaves;
491,X,the damp paths rustle underfoot
492,X,thick with the crisp broad leaves of the planes.
493,X,
494,X,The tang of the smoke and the reek of the box
495,X,and the savor of the year's decay
496,X,are soft in the gardens of Aranjuez
497,X,where the fountains fill silently with leaves
498,X,and the moss grows over the statues and busts
499,X,clothing the simpering cupids and fauns
500,X,whose stone eyes search the empty paths
501,X,for the rustling rich brocaded gowns
502,X,and the neat silk calves of the halcyon past.
503,X,
504,X,The Tagus flows with a noise of wiers through Aranjuez.
505,X,And slipping by mirrors the brown-silver trunks
506,X,of the planes and the hedges
507,X,of box and spires of cypress and alleys of yellowing elms;
508,X,and on the other bank three grey mules pulling a cart
509,X,"loaded with turnips, driven by a man in a blue woolen sash"
510,X,who strides along whistling and does not look towards Aranjuez.
511,X,

514,XI,
515,XI,Beyond ruffled velvet hills
516,XI,the sky burns yellow like a candle-flame.
517,XI,
518,XI,Sudden a village
519,XI,roofs against the sky
520,XI,leaping buttresses
521,XI,a church
522,XI,and a tower utter dark like the heart
523,XI,of a candleflame.
524,XI,
525,XI,Swing the bronze-bells
526,XI,uncoiling harsh slow sound through the dusk
527,XI,that growls out in the conversational clatter
528,XI,Of the trainwheels and the rails.
529,XI,
530,XI,A hill humps unexpectedly to hide
531,XI,the tower erect like a pistil
532,XI,in the depths of the tremendous flaming
533,XI,flower of the west.

539,XII,
540,XII,Genteel noise of Paris hats
541,XII,and beards that tilt this way and that.
542,XII,Mirrors create on either side
543,XII,infinities of chandeliers.
544,XII,

1726,X,The ghosts that dwell in books to flight
1727,X,"Of word and image that, divine,"

1745,X,"Smelling of lilacs and early roses and night,"
1746,X,Clamorous with the names and phrases of the throngs
1747,X,"Of the garlanded dead, and with glasses pledged to the light"
1748,X,Of the dawning to come ...
1749,X,
1750,X,O in the morning we would go
1751,X,Out into the drudging world and sing

1754,X,Abroad through all the drowsy earth

1757,X,And dancing joy; laughingly unveiled
1758,X,From the sick mist of fear to run naked and leap
1759,X,And shake the nations from their snoring sleep.
1760,X,
1761,X,O in the morning we would go
1762,X,Fantastically arrayed
1763,X,"In silk and scarlet braid,"
1764,X,In rich glitter like the sun on snow
1765,X,"With banners of orange, vermillion, black,"

1775,X,"Lilting thumping free,"
1776,X,Pipes and kettledrums and flutes
1777,X,And brazen braying trumpet-calls
1778,X,Would wake each work-drowsed town
1779,X,"And shake it in laughter down,"
1780,X,Untuning in dust the shuttered walls.
1781,X,
1782,X,O in the morning we would go
1783,X,With doleful steps so dragging and slow
1784,X,And grievous mockery of woe
1785,X,And bury the old gods where they lay
1786,X,"Sodden drunk with men's pain in the day,"
1787,X,In the dawn's first new burning white ray
1788,X,"That would shrivel like dead leaves the sacred lies,"
1789,X,"The avengers, the graspers, the wringers of sighs,"
1790,X,"Of blood from men's work-twisted hands, from their eyes"
1791,X,Of tears without hope ... But in the burning day
1792,X,"Of the dawn we would see them brooding to slay,"
1793,X,In a great wind whirled like dead leaves away.

2843,II,calm implacable queen of the east
2844,II,who erect against sunrise holds in the folds

2947,III,and whine of arrows and blood-clots on new spearshafts

2949,III,"and one, in a droning voice"
2950,III,recited the maxims of Lao Tse.

2963,III,The long gold nails of his right hand
2964,III,were held together at the tips

2978,III,slit the base of his large belly
2979,III,and inserted the other and fell upon it
2980,III,and sprawled beside the king's footstool.

3338,VIII,to burn the colors of my pictures dead.
3339,VIII,
3340,VIII,Through all these years the walls have writhed
3341,VIII,with shadow overlaid upon shadow.
3342,VIII,I have bruised my fingers on the windowbars
3343,VIII,so many lives cemented and made strong.
3344,VIII,
3345,VIII,"While the bars stand strong, outside"
3346,VIII,the great processions of men's lives go past.
3347,VIII,Their shadows squirm distorted on my wall.

3356,IX,Three kites against the sunset
3357,IX,flaunt their long-tailed triangles
3358,IX,above the inquisitive chimney-pots.
3359,IX,
3360,IX,A pompous ragged minstrel
3361,IX,sings beside our dining-table
3362,IX,a very old romantic song:
3363,IX,
3364,IX,_I love the sound of the hunting-horns
3365,IX,deep in the woods at night._
3366,IX,
3367,IX,A wind makes dance the fine acacia leaves
3368,IX,and flutters the cloths of the tables.
3369,IX,The kites tremble and soar.
3370,IX,The voice throbs sugared into croaking base
3371,IX,broken with the burden of the too ancient songs.
3372,IX,
3373,IX,"And yet, beyond the flaring sky,"
3374,IX,"beyond the soaring kites,"
3375,IX,"where are no voices of singers,"
3376,IX,"no strummings of guitars,"
3377,IX,the untarnished songs
3378,IX,hang like great moths just broken
3379,IX,"through the dun threads of their cocoons,"
3380,IX,"moist, motionless, limp"
3381,IX,as flowers on the inaccessible twigs
3382,IX,"of the yewtree, Ygdrasil,"
3383,IX,the untarnished songs.
3384,IX,
3385,IX,Will you put your hand in mine
3386,IX,"pompous street-singer,"
3387,IX,and start on a quest with me?
3388,IX,For men have cut down the woods where the laurel grew
3389,IX,"to build streets of frame houses,"
3390,IX,they have dug in the hills after iron
3391,IX,and frightened the troll-king away;
3392,IX,at night in the woods no hunter puffs out his cheeks
3393,IX,to call to the kill on the hunting-horn.
3394,IX,
3395,IX,Now when the kites flaunt bravely
3396,IX,their tissue-paper glory in the sunset
3397,IX,we will walk together down the darkening streets
3398,IX,beyond these tables and the sunset.
3399,IX,
3400,IX,We will hear the singing of drunken men
3401,IX,and the songs whores sing
3402,IX,in their doorways at night
3403,IX,and the endless soft crooning
3404,IX,"of all the mothers,"
3405,IX,and what words the young men hum
3406,IX,when they walk beside the river
3407,IX,"their arms hot with caresses,"
3408,IX,their cheeks pressed against their girls' cheeks.
3409,IX,
3410,IX,We will lean very close
3411,IX,to the quiet lips of the dead
3412,IX,and feel in our worn-out flesh perhaps
3413,IX,a flutter of wings as they soar from us
3414,IX,the untarnished songs.
3415,IX,
3416,IX,But the minstrel sings as the pennies clink:
3417,IX,_I love the sound of the hunting-horns
3418,IX,deep in the woods at night._
3419,IX,
3420,IX,O who will go on a quest with me
3421,IX,beyond all wide seas
3422,IX,all mountain passes
3423,IX,and climb at last with me
3424,IX,among the imperishable branches
3425,IX,"of the yewtree, Ygdrasil,"
3426,IX,so that all the limp unuttered songs
3427,IX,shall spread their great moth-wings and soar
3428,IX,above the craning necks of the chimneys
3429,IX,above the tissue-paper kites and the sunset
3430,IX,"above the diners and their dining-tables,"
3431,IX,beat upward with strong wing-beats steadily
3432,IX,till they can drink the quenchless honey of the moon.

3443,X,the moon skims like a curved white sail
3444,X,bellied by the evening wind
3445,X,and bound for some glittering harbor
3446,X,that blue hills circle
3447,X,among the purple archipelagos of cloud.
3448,X,
3449,X,"So, in the quivering bubble of my memories"
3450,X,the schooners with peaked sails
3451,X,lean athwart the low dark shore;
3452,X,their sails glow apricot-color
3453,X,or glint as white as the salt-bitten shells on the beach
3454,X,and are curved at the tip like gulls' wings:
3455,X,their courses are set for impossible oceans
3456,X,where on the gold imaginary sands
3457,X,they will unload their many-scented freight
3458,X,of very childish dreams.
3459,X,
3460,X,Dark on the blue light of the stream
3461,X,the barges lie anchored under the moon;
3462,X,the wind brings from them to my ears
3463,X,"faint creaking of rudder-cords, tiny slappings"
3464,X,"of waves against their pitch-smeared flanks,"
3465,X,to my nose a smell of bales and merchandise
3466,X,the wet familiar smell of harbors
3467,X,and the old arousing fragrance
3468,X,making the muscles ache and the blood seethe
3469,X,and the eyes see the roadsteads and the golden beaches
3470,X,where with singing they would furl the sails
3471,X,of the schooners of childish dreams.
3472,X,
3473,X,On icegreen seas of sunset
3474,X,the moon skims like a curved white sail:
3475,X,had I forgotten the fragrance of old dreams
3476,X,that the smell from the anchored barges
3477,X,can so fill my blood with bitterness
3478,X,that the sight of the scudding moon
3479,X,makes my eyes tingle with salt tears?
3480,X,
3481,X,In the ship's track on the infertile sea
3482,X,now many childish bodies float
3483,X,rotting under the white moon.

3499,XI,their ghosts of faded golden springs

3533,XI,in the windy rain
3534,XI,lisp of tremulous love-makings
3535,XI,interlaced soundless kisses
3536,XI,impact of dead springs
3537,XI,nuzzling tremulous at life
3538,XI,in the red sundown.

3541,XI,O scud steaming up out of the deep sea

3544,XI,beat upon my face and neck
3545,XI,"glisten on my outstretched hands,"
3546,XI,run bright lilac streams
3547,XI,through the clogged channels of my brain
3548,XI,corrode the clicking cogs the little angles

3551,XI,of mustnot darenot cannot
3552,XI,spatter the varnish off me
3553,XI,that I may stand up
3554,XI,my face to the wet wind
3555,XI,and feel my body
3556,XI,and drenched salty palpitant April
3557,XI,reborn in my flesh.
3558,XI,
3559,XI,I would spit the dust out of my mouth
3560,XI,burst out of these stiff wire webs
3561,XI,supple incautious
3562,XI,like the crocuses that spurt up too soon
3563,XI,their saffron flames
3564,XI,and die gloriously in late blizzards
3565,XI,and leave no seed.
