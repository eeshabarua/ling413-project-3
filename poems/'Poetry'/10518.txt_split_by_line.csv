19,POEMS,
20,POEMS,"The Publishers of this volume, desiring to print it in an improved form,"
21,POEMS,have asked me to write something by way of preface or supplement to the
22,POEMS,new edition. After some deliberation I have found myself unable to comply
23,POEMS,with this request. These pages were written in the first half of the year
24,POEMS,"1870, a time of intense interest and importance, to Spain. I left Madrid"
25,POEMS,"in the memorable August of that year, passing through Paris when that"
26,POEMS,beautiful city was lying in the torpor which followed the wild excitement
27,POEMS,"of the declaration of war, and preceded the fury of despair that came with"
28,POEMS,the catastrophe of Sedan. I then intended to return to Spain before long;
29,POEMS,"and, in fact, few years have passed since that time in which I have not"
30,POEMS,nourished the dream of revisiting the Peninsula and its scenes of magic
31,POEMS,and romance. But many cares and duties have intervened; I have never gone
32,POEMS,"back to Spain, and I have arrived at an age when I begin to doubt if I"
33,POEMS,have any castles there requiring my attention.
34,POEMS,
35,POEMS,I have therefore nothing to add to this little book. Reading it again
36,POEMS,"after the lapse of many years, I find much that might be advantageously"
37,POEMS,"modified or omitted. But as its merits, if it have any, are merely those"
38,POEMS,"of youth, so also are its faults, and they are immanent and structural;"
39,POEMS,they cannot be amended without tearing the book to pieces. For this reason
40,POEMS,I have confined myself to the correction of the most obvious and flagrant
41,POEMS,"errors, and can only hope the kindly reader will pass over with an"
42,POEMS,"indulgent smile the rapid judgments, the hot prejudices, the pitiless"
43,POEMS,"condemnations, the lyric eulogies, born of an honest enthusiasm and"
44,POEMS,unchecked by the reserve which comes of age and experience. I venture to
45,POEMS,"hope, though with some anxiety and uncertainty, that the honest enthusiasm"
46,POEMS,"may itself be recognized, as well as the candor which the writer tried to"
47,POEMS,preserve in speaking of things which powerfully appealed to his loves and
48,POEMS,his hates.
49,POEMS,
50,POEMS,I therefore commit this book to the public once more with its
51,POEMS,"imperfections on its head; with its prophecies unfulfilled, its hopes"
52,POEMS,"baffled, its observations in many instances rendered obsolete by the swift"
53,POEMS,progress of events. A changed Europe--far different from that which I
54,POEMS,traversed twenty years ago--suffers in a new fever-dream of war and
55,POEMS,revolution north of the Pyrenees; and beyond those picturesque mountains
56,POEMS,the Spanish monarchy enjoys a new lease of life by favor of circumstances
57,POEMS,which demand a chronicler of more leisure than myself. I must leave what I
58,POEMS,wrote in the midst of the stirring scenes of the interregnum between the
59,POEMS,"secular monarchy and the short-lived Republic--whose advent I foresaw, but"
60,POEMS,whose sudden fall was veiled from my sanguine vision--without defense or
61,POEMS,"apology, claiming only that it was written in good faith, from a heart"
62,POEMS,filled with passionate convictions and an ardent love and devotion to what
63,POEMS,"is best in Spain. I recorded what I saw, and my eyes were better then than"
64,POEMS,"now. I trust I have not too often spoken amiss of a people whose art,"
65,POEMS,"whose literature, whose language, and whose character compelled my highest"
66,POEMS,"admiration, and with whom I enjoyed friendships which are among the"
67,POEMS,dearest recollections of my life.

169,POEMS,"Jim Bludso, of the Prairie Belle."
170,POEMS,
171,POEMS,
172,POEMS,"Wall, no! I can't tell whar he lives,"
173,POEMS,"Becase he don't live, you see;"
174,POEMS,"Leastways, he's got out of the habit"
175,POEMS,Of livin' like you and me.
176,POEMS,Whar have you been for the last three year
177,POEMS,That you haven't heard folks tell
178,POEMS,How Jimmy Bludso passed in his checks
179,POEMS,The night of the Prairie Belle?
180,POEMS,
181,POEMS,"He weren't no saint,--them engineers"
182,POEMS,"Is all pretty much alike,"
183,POEMS,One wife in Natchez-under-the-Hill
184,POEMS,"And another one here, in Pike;"
185,POEMS,"A keerless man in his talk was Jim,"
186,POEMS,"And an awkward hand in a row,"
187,POEMS,"But he never flunked, and he never lied,--"
188,POEMS,I reckon he never knowed how.
189,POEMS,
190,POEMS,"And this was all the religion he had,--"
191,POEMS,To treat his engine well;
192,POEMS,Never be passed on the river
193,POEMS,To mind the pilot's bell;
194,POEMS,"And if ever the Prairie Belle took fire,--"
195,POEMS,"A thousand times he swore,"
196,POEMS,He'd hold her nozzle agin the bank
197,POEMS,Till the last soul got ashore.
198,POEMS,
199,POEMS,"All boats has their day on the Mississip,"
200,POEMS,"And her day come at last,"
201,POEMS,"The Movastar was a better boat,"
202,POEMS,But the Belle she _would n't_ be passed.
203,POEMS,And so she come tearin' along that night--
204,POEMS,The oldest craft on the line--
205,POEMS,"With a nigger squat on her safety-valve,"
206,POEMS,"And her furnace crammed, rosin and pine."
207,POEMS,
208,POEMS,"The fire bust out as she clared the bar,"
209,POEMS,"And burnt a hole in the night,"
210,POEMS,"And quick as a flash she turned, and made"
211,POEMS,For that willer-bank on the right.
212,POEMS,"There was runnin' and cursin', but Jim yelled out,"
213,POEMS,"Over all the infernal roar,"
214,POEMS,"""I'll hold her nozzle agin the bank"
215,POEMS,"Till the last galoot's ashore."""
216,POEMS,
217,POEMS,"Through the hot, black breath of the burnin' boat"
218,POEMS,"Jim Bludso's voice was heard,"
219,POEMS,"And they all had trust in his cussedness,"
220,POEMS,And knowed he would keep his word.
221,POEMS,"And, sure's you're born, they all got off"
222,POEMS,"Afore the smokestacks fell,--"
223,POEMS,And Bludso's ghost went up alone
224,POEMS,In the smoke of the Prairie Belle.
225,POEMS,
226,POEMS,"He weren't no saint,--but at jedgment"
227,POEMS,"I'd run my chance with Jim,"
228,POEMS,'Longside of some pious gentlemen
229,POEMS,That wouldn't shook hands with him.
230,POEMS,"He seen his duty, a dead-sure thing,--"
231,POEMS,And went for it thar and then;
232,POEMS,And Christ ain't a going to be too hard
233,POEMS,On a man that died for men.

240,POEMS,"I don't go much on religion,"
241,POEMS,I never ain't had no show;
242,POEMS,"But I've got a middlin' tight grip, sir,"
243,POEMS,On the handful o' things I know.
244,POEMS,I don't pan out on the prophets
245,POEMS,"And free-will, and that sort of thing,--"
246,POEMS,"But I b'lieve in God and the angels,"
247,POEMS,Ever sence one night last spring.
248,POEMS,
249,POEMS,"I come into town with some turnips,"
250,POEMS,"And my little Gabe come along,--"
251,POEMS,No four-year-old in the county
252,POEMS,"Could beat him for pretty and strong,"
253,POEMS,"Peart and chipper and sassy,"
254,POEMS,"Always ready to swear and fight,--"
255,POEMS,And I'd larnt him to chaw terbacker
256,POEMS,Jest to keep his milk-teeth white.
257,POEMS,
258,POEMS,The snow come down like a blanket
259,POEMS,As I passed by Taggart's store;
260,POEMS,I went in for a jug of molasses
261,POEMS,And left the team at the door.
262,POEMS,"They scared at something and started,--"
263,POEMS,"I heard one little squall,"
264,POEMS,And hell-to-split over the prairie
265,POEMS,"Went team, Little Breeches and all."
266,POEMS,
267,POEMS,Hell-to-split over the prairie!
268,POEMS,I was almost froze with skeer;
269,POEMS,"But we rousted up some torches,"
270,POEMS,And sarched for 'em far and near.
271,POEMS,"At last we struck hosses and wagon,"
272,POEMS,"Snowed under a soft white mound,"
273,POEMS,"Upsot, dead beat,--but of little Gabe"
274,POEMS,No hide nor hair was found.
275,POEMS,
276,POEMS,"And here all hope soured on me,"
277,POEMS,"Of my fellow-critter's aid,--"
278,POEMS,"I jest flopped down on my marrow-bones,"
279,POEMS,"Crotch-deep in the snow, and prayed."
280,POEMS,
281,POEMS,*       *       *       *       *
282,POEMS,
283,POEMS,"By this, the torches was played out,"
284,POEMS,And me and Isrul Parr
285,POEMS,Went off for some wood to a sheepfold
286,POEMS,That he said was somewhar thar.
287,POEMS,
288,POEMS,"We found it at last, and a little shed"
289,POEMS,Where they shut up the lambs at night.
290,POEMS,"We looked in and seen them huddled thar,"
291,POEMS,So warm and sleepy and white;
292,POEMS,"And thar sot Little Breeches and chirped,"
293,POEMS,"As peart as ever you see,"
294,POEMS,"""I want a chaw of terbacker,"
295,POEMS,"And that's what's the matter of me."""
296,POEMS,
297,POEMS,How did he git thar? Angels.
298,POEMS,He could never have walked in that storm
299,POEMS,They jest scooped down and toted him
300,POEMS,To whar it was safe and warm.
301,POEMS,"And I think that saving a little child,"
302,POEMS,"And fotching him to his own,"
303,POEMS,Is a derned sight better business
304,POEMS,Than loafing around The Throne.

310,POEMS,(Remarks of Sergeant Tilmon Joy to The White Man's Committee of Spunky
311,POEMS,"Point, Illinois.)"
312,POEMS,
313,POEMS,
314,POEMS,"I reckon I git your drift, gents,--"
315,POEMS,You 'low the boy sha'n't stay;
316,POEMS,This is a white man's country;
317,POEMS,"You're Dimocrats, you say;"
318,POEMS,"And whereas, and seein', and wherefore,"
319,POEMS,"The times bein' all out o' j'int,"
320,POEMS,The nigger has got to mosey
321,POEMS,From the limits o' Spunky P'int!
322,POEMS,
323,POEMS,Le's reason the thing a minute:
324,POEMS,"I'm an old-fashioned Dimocrat too,"
325,POEMS,Though I laid my politics out o' the way
326,POEMS,For to keep till the war was through.
327,POEMS,"But I come back here, allowin'"
328,POEMS,"To vote as I used to do,"
329,POEMS,Though it gravels me like the devil to train
330,POEMS,Along o' sich fools as you.
331,POEMS,
332,POEMS,"Now dog my cats ef I kin see,"
333,POEMS,"In all the light of the day,"
334,POEMS,What you've got to do with the question
335,POEMS,Ef Tim shill go or stay.
336,POEMS,"And furder than that I give notice,"
337,POEMS,"Ef one of you tetches the boy,"
338,POEMS,He kin check his trunks to a warmer clime
339,POEMS,"Than he'll find in Illanoy,"
340,POEMS,
341,POEMS,"Why, blame your hearts, jest hear me!"
342,POEMS,You know that ungodly day
343,POEMS,"When our left struck Vicksburg Heights, how ripped"
344,POEMS,And torn and tattered we lay.
345,POEMS,"When the rest retreated I stayed behind,"
346,POEMS,"Fur reasons sufficient to me,--"
347,POEMS,"With a rib caved in, and a leg on a strike,"
348,POEMS,I sprawled on that cursed glacee.
349,POEMS,
350,POEMS,"Lord! how the hot sun went for us,"
351,POEMS,And br'iled and blistered and burned!
352,POEMS,How the Rebel bullets whizzed round us
353,POEMS,When a cuss in his death-grip turned!
354,POEMS,Till along toward dusk I seen a thing
355,POEMS,I couldn't believe for a spell:
356,POEMS,That nigger--that Tim--was a crawlin' to me
357,POEMS,"Through that fire-proof, gilt-edged hell!"
358,POEMS,
359,POEMS,"The Rebels seen him as quick as me,"
360,POEMS,And the bullets buzzed like bees;
361,POEMS,"But he jumped for me, and shouldered me,"
362,POEMS,Though a shot brought him once to his knees;
363,POEMS,"But he staggered up, and packed me off,"
364,POEMS,"With a dozen stumbles and falls,"
365,POEMS,"Till safe in our lines he drapped us both,"
366,POEMS,His black hide riddled with balls.
367,POEMS,
368,POEMS,"So, my gentle gazelles, thar's my answer,"
369,POEMS,And here stays Banty Tim:
370,POEMS,"He trumped Death's ace for me that day,"
371,POEMS,And I'm not goin' back on him!
372,POEMS,You may rezoloot till the cows come home
373,POEMS,"But ef one of you tetches the boy,"
374,POEMS,He'll wrastle his hash to-night in hell.

380,POEMS,
381,POEMS,
382,POEMS,"The darkest, strangest mystery"
383,POEMS,"I ever read, or heern, or see,"
384,POEMS,"Is 'long of a drink at Taggart's Hall,--"
385,POEMS,Tom Taggart's of Gilgal.
386,POEMS,
387,POEMS,"I've heern the tale a thousand ways,"
388,POEMS,But never could git through the maze
389,POEMS,That hangs around that queer day's doin's;
390,POEMS,But I'll tell the yarn to youans.
391,POEMS,
392,POEMS,"Tom Taggart stood behind his bar,"
393,POEMS,"The time was fall, the skies was fa'r,"
394,POEMS,"The neighbors round the counter drawed,"
395,POEMS,And ca'mly drinked and jawed.
396,POEMS,
397,POEMS,"At last come Colonel Blood of Pike,"
398,POEMS,"And old Jedge Phinn, permiscus-like,"
399,POEMS,"And each, as he meandered in,"
400,POEMS,"Remarked, ""A whisky-skin"""
401,POEMS,
402,POEMS,"Tom mixed the beverage full and fa'r,"
403,POEMS,"And slammed it, smoking, on the bar."
404,POEMS,"Some says three fingers, some says two,--"
405,POEMS,I'll leave the choice to you.
406,POEMS,
407,POEMS,Phinn to the drink put forth his hand;
408,POEMS,"Blood drawed his knife, with accent bland,"
409,POEMS,"""I ax yer parding, Mister Phinn--"
410,POEMS,"Jest drap that whisky-skin."""
411,POEMS,
412,POEMS,No man high-toneder could be found
413,POEMS,Than old Jedge Phinn the country round.
414,POEMS,"Says he, ""Young man, the tribe of Phinns"
415,POEMS,"Knows their own whisky-skins!"""
416,POEMS,
417,POEMS,He went for his 'leven-inch bowie-knife:--
418,POEMS,"""I tries to foller a Christian life;"
419,POEMS,"But I'll drap a slice of liver or two,"
420,POEMS,"My bloomin' shrub, with you."""
421,POEMS,
422,POEMS,"They carved in a way that all admired,"
423,POEMS,"Tell Blood drawed iron at last, and fired."
424,POEMS,"It took Seth Bludso 'twixt the eyes,"
425,POEMS,Which caused him great surprise.
426,POEMS,
427,POEMS,"Then coats went off, and all went in;"
428,POEMS,Shots and bad language swelled the din;
429,POEMS,"The short, sharp bark of Derringers,"
430,POEMS,"Like bull-pups, cheered the furse."
431,POEMS,
432,POEMS,They piled the stiffs outside the door;
433,POEMS,"They made, I reckon, a cord or more."
434,POEMS,"Girls went that winter, as a rule,"
435,POEMS,Alone to spellin'-school.

1388,IV.,The stars of midnight sifted

1391,IV.,So fair and white and cold.
1392,IV.,
1393,IV.,Fair and white and cold she lay
1394,IV.,Beneath the starry skies;

1397,IV.,
1398,IV.,"He won her drowsy fancy,"
1399,IV.,"He bore her to his towers,"
1400,IV.,And swift with love and laughter
1401,IV.,Flew morning's purpled hours.
1402,IV.,
1403,IV.,But when the thickening sunbeams
1404,IV.,"Had drunk the gleaming dew,"
1405,IV.,A misty cloud of sorrow
1406,IV.,Swept o'er her eyes' deep blue.
1407,IV.,
1408,IV.,"She hung upon the Ritter's neck,"

1432,IV.,
1433,IV.,But when the mid-watch moonlight

1447,IV.,
1448,IV.,There was never a castle seen
1449,IV.,So fair as mine in Spain:
1450,IV.,"It stands embowered in green,"
1451,IV.,Crowning the gentle slope
1452,IV.,"Of a hill by the Xenil's shore,"
1453,IV.,And at eve its shade flaunts o'er
1454,IV.,"The storied Vega plain,"
1455,IV.,And its towers are hid in the mists of Hope;
1456,IV.,And I toil through years of pain
1457,IV.,Its glimmering gates to gain.
1458,IV.,
1459,IV.,In visions wild and sweet
1460,IV.,Sometimes its courts I greet:
1461,IV.,Sometimes in joy its shining halls
1462,IV.,I tread with favored feet;
1463,IV.,But never my eyes in the light of day
1464,IV.,"Were blest with its ivied walls,"
1465,IV.,Where the marble white and the granite gray
1466,IV.,"Turn gold alike when the sunbeams play,"
1467,IV.,When the soft day dimly falls.
1468,IV.,
1469,IV.,I know in its dusky rooms
1470,IV.,Are treasures rich and rare;
1471,IV.,"The spoil of Eastern looms,"
1472,IV.,And whatever of bright and fair
1473,IV.,Painters divine have caught and won
1474,IV.,From the vault of Italy's air:
1475,IV.,White gods in Phidian stone
1476,IV.,People the haunted glooms;
1477,IV.,And the song of immortal singers
1478,IV.,"Like a fragrant memory lingers,"
1479,IV.,"I know, in the echoing rooms."
1480,IV.,
1481,IV.,"But nothing of these, my soul!"
1482,IV.,"Nor castle, nor treasures, nor skies,"
1483,IV.,Nor the waves of the river that roll

1486,IV.,Nothing of these is the goal
1487,IV.,For which my whole heart sighs.
1488,IV.,'Tis the pearl gives worth to the shell--
1489,IV.,The pearl I would die to gain;

1492,IV.,The Queen whose gracious reign
1493,IV.,Makes glad my Castle in Spain.

1495,IV.,Her face so pure and fair
1496,IV.,"Sheds light in the shady places,"
1497,IV.,And the spell of her girlish graces

1499,IV.,A breath of purity
1500,IV.,"Forever before her flies,"
1501,IV.,And ill things cease to be
1502,IV.,In the glance of her honest eyes.
1503,IV.,"Around her pathway flutter,"
1504,IV.,Where her dear feet wander free
1505,IV.,"In youth's pure majesty,"
1506,IV.,The wings of the vague desires;
1507,IV.,But the thought that love would utter
1508,IV.,In reverence expires.
1509,IV.,
1510,IV.,Not yet! not yet shall I see
1511,IV.,That face which shines like a star
1512,IV.,"O'er my storm-swept life afar,"
1513,IV.,Transfigured with love for me.
1514,IV.,"Toiling, forgetting, and learning"
1515,IV.,"With labor and vigils and prayers,"
1516,IV.,"Pure heart and resolute will,"
1517,IV.,At last I shall climb the hill
1518,IV.,And breathe the enchanted airs
1519,IV.,Where the light of my life is burning

1521,IV.,"Where alone in her youth and beauty,"
1522,IV.,"And bound by her fate's sweet duty,"
1523,IV.,Unconscious she waits for me.

1533,IV.,On that the great world's mystery;
1534,IV.,But all unseen and all unguessed
1535,IV.,They could not break upon her rest.
1536,IV.,"The world's far splendors gleamed and flashed,"
1537,IV.,Afar the wild seas foamed and dashed;
1538,IV.,"But in her small, dull Paradise,"
1539,IV.,"Safe housed from rapture or surprise,"
1540,IV.,Nor day nor night had power to fright
1541,IV.,The peace of God that filled her eyes.

1563,IV.,"The White men are ten millions,"

1568,IV.,So Custer and all his fighting men
1569,IV.,"Lay under the evening skies,"
1570,IV.,Staring up at the tranquil heaven

1572,IV.,
1573,IV.,And of all that stood at noonday
1574,IV.,"In that fiery scorpion ring,"
1575,IV.,Miles Keogh's horse at evening
1576,IV.,Was the only living thing.
1577,IV.,
1578,IV.,"Alone from that field of slaughter,"
1579,IV.,"Where lay the three hundred slain,"
1580,IV.,"The horse Comanche wandered,"
1581,IV.,With Keogh's blood on his mane.
1582,IV.,
1583,IV.,"And Sturgis issued this order,"
1584,IV.,"Which future times shall read,"
1585,IV.,While the love and honor of comrades

1637,IV.,The ghostly ring of the viewless swords

1639,IV.,
1640,IV.,We think with imperious questionings

1649,IV.,It was not their time for rest and sleep;
1650,IV.,Their hearts beat high and strong;

1657,IV.,
1658,IV.,Again they come! Again I hear

1815,IV.,"Tell me the two good reasons, pray,"
1816,IV.,"I have, to say you are like spring?"
1817,IV.,
1818,IV.,[You give it up?] Because we love you--
1819,IV.,And see so very little of you.

1825,IV.,
1826,IV.,In the dim chamber whence but yesterday
1827,IV.,"Passed my belovèd, filled with awe I stand;"
1828,IV.,And haunting Loves fluttering on every hand
1829,IV.,Whisper her praises who is far away.
1830,IV.,A thousand delicate fancies glance and play
1831,IV.,"On every object which her robes have fanned,"
1832,IV.,And tenderest thoughts and hopes bloom and expand
1833,IV.,In the sweet memory of her beauty's ray.
1834,IV.,Ah! could that glass but hold the faintest trace
1835,IV.,"Of all the loveliness once mirrored there,"
1836,IV.,The clustering glory of the shadowy hair
1837,IV.,That framed so well the dear young angel face!
1838,IV.,"But no, it shows my own face, full of care,"
1839,IV.,And my heart is her beauty's dwelling-place.

1848,IV.,"I press her hand, her lips I kiss,"
1849,IV.,"But still love's full assurance miss,"
1850,IV.,Our waking life forever seems
1851,IV.,Cleft by a veil of doubt and dreams.
1852,IV.,
1853,IV.,But love and night and sleep combine
1854,IV.,In dreams to make her wholly mine.
1855,IV.,"A sure love lights her eyes' deep blue,"
1856,IV.,Her hands and lips are warm and true.
1857,IV.,"Always the fact unreal seems,"
1858,IV.,And truth I find alone in dreams.

1862,IV.,The Light of Love
1863,IV.,
1864,IV.,
1865,IV.,Each shining light above us
1866,IV.,Has its own peculiar grace;
1867,IV.,But every light of heaven
1868,IV.,Is in my darling's face.
1869,IV.,
1870,IV.,"For it is like the sunlight,"
1871,IV.,"So strong and pure and warm,"
1872,IV.,"That folds all good and happy things,"
1873,IV.,And guards from gloom and harm.
1874,IV.,
1875,IV.,"And it is like the moonlight,"
1876,IV.,So holy and so calm;
1877,IV.,"The rapt peace of a summer night,"
1878,IV.,When soft winds die in balm.
1879,IV.,
1880,IV.,And it is like the starlight;
1881,IV.,"For, love her as I may,"
1882,IV.,She dwells still lofty and serene
1883,IV.,In mystery far away.

1892,IV.,"Upon my life Love's joy and truth,"
1893,IV.,I will not let thee go.
1894,IV.,
1895,IV.,And sudden on my night there woke
1896,IV.,The trouble of the dawn;
1897,IV.,"Out of the east the red light broke,"
1898,IV.,To broaden on and on.
1899,IV.,
1900,IV.,"And now let death be far or nigh,"

1902,IV.,"I cannot all untimely die,"
1903,IV.,"For love, for love is mine."
1904,IV.,
1905,IV.,"My days are tuned to finer chords,"
1906,IV.,"And lit by higher suns;,"
1907,IV.,Through all my thoughts and all my words
1908,IV.,A purer purpose runs.
1909,IV.,
1910,IV.,The blank page of my heart grows rife
1911,IV.,With wealth of tender lore;
1912,IV.,"Her image, stamped upon my life,"
1913,IV.,Gives value evermore.
1914,IV.,
1915,IV.,"She is so noble, firm, and true,"
1916,IV.,"I drink truth from her eyes,"
1917,IV.,As violets gain the heaven's own blue
1918,IV.,In gazing at the skies.
1919,IV.,
1920,IV.,No matter if my hands attain
1921,IV.,The golden crown or cross
1922,IV.,Only to love is such a gain
1923,IV.,That losing is not loss.
1924,IV.,
1925,IV.,And thus whatever fate betide
1926,IV.,"Of rapture or of pain,"
1927,IV.,"If storm or sun the future hide,"
1928,IV.,My love is not in vain.
1929,IV.,
1930,IV.,So only thanks are on my lips;
1931,IV.,And through my love I see
1932,IV.,"My earliest dreams, like freighted ships,"
1933,IV.,Come sailing home to me.

1942,IV.,And happy birds were singing
1943,IV.,"The praises of the May,"
1944,IV.,"A word came to me, blighting"
1945,IV.,"The beauty of the scene,"
1946,IV.,"And in my heart was winter,"
1947,IV.,Though all the trees were green.
1948,IV.,
1949,IV.,Now down the blast go sailing
1950,IV.,"The dead leaves, brown and sere;"
1951,IV.,The forests are bewailing
1952,IV.,The dying of the year;
1953,IV.,"A word comes to me, lighting"

1966,IV.,To carry me to unknown lands.
1967,IV.,
1968,IV.,"His whinny shrill, his pawing hoof,"
1969,IV.,Sound dreadful as a gathering storm;
1970,IV.,"And I must leave this sheltering roof,"
1971,IV.,And joys of life so soft and warm.
1972,IV.,
1973,IV.,"Tender and warm the joys of life,--"
1974,IV.,"Good friends, the faithful and the true;"
1975,IV.,"My rosy children and my wife,"

1988,IV.,[C.K. _loquitur_.]
1989,IV.,
1990,IV.,I dreamed I was in fair Niphon.
1991,IV.,"Amid tea-fields I journeyed on,"
1992,IV.,Reclined in my jinrikishaw;
1993,IV.,Across the rolling plains I saw
1994,IV.,"The lordly Fusi-yama rise,"
1995,IV.,His blue cone lost in bluer skies.
1996,IV.,
1997,IV.,At last I bade my bearers stop
1998,IV.,Before what seemed a china-shop.
1999,IV.,I roused myself and entered in.
2000,IV.,"A fearful joy, like some sweet sin,"
2001,IV.,"Pierced through my bosom as I gazed,"
2002,IV.,"Entranced, transported, and amazed."
2003,IV.,
2004,IV.,"For all the house was but one room,"
2005,IV.,"And in its clear and grateful gloom,"
2006,IV.,Filled with all odors strange and strong
2007,IV.,"That to the wondrous East belong,"
2008,IV.,"I saw above, around, below,"
2009,IV.,"A sight to make the warm heart glow,"
2010,IV.,"And leave the eager soul no lack,"
2011,IV.,An endless wealth of bric-a-brac.
2012,IV.,
2013,IV.,"I saw bronze statues, old and rare,"
2014,IV.,"Fashioned by no mere mortal skill,"
2015,IV.,"With robes that fluttered in the air,"
2016,IV.,Blown out by Art's eternal will;
2017,IV.,"And delicate ivory netsukes,"
2018,IV.,"Richer in tone than Cheddar cheese,"
2019,IV.,"Of saints and hermits, cats and dogs,"
2020,IV.,Grim warriors and ecstatic frogs.
2021,IV.,
2022,IV.,"And here and there those wondrous masks,"
2023,IV.,"More living flesh than sandal-wood,"
2024,IV.,Where the full soul in pleasure basks
2025,IV.,"And dreams of love, the only good."
2026,IV.,The walls were all with pictures hung:
2027,IV.,"Gay villas bright in rain-washed air,"
2028,IV.,"Trees to whose boughs brown monkeys clung,"
2029,IV.,Outlineless dabs of fuzzy hair.
2030,IV.,And all about the opulent shelves
2031,IV.,Littered with porcelain beyond price:
2032,IV.,Imari pots arrayed themselves
2033,IV.,Beside Ming dishes; grain-of-rice
2034,IV.,"Vied with the Royal Satsuma,"
2035,IV.,Proud of its sallow ivory beam;
2036,IV.,And Kaga's Thousand Hermits lay
2037,IV.,Tranced in some punch-bowl's golden gleam.
2038,IV.,"Over bronze censers, black with age,"
2039,IV.,The five-clawed dragons strife engage;
2040,IV.,A curled and insolent Dog of Foo
2041,IV.,Sniffs at the smoke aspiring through.
2042,IV.,
2043,IV.,"In what old days, in what far lands,"
2044,IV.,"What busy brains, what cunning hands,"
2045,IV.,"With what quaint speech, what alien thought,"
2046,IV.,Strange fellow-men these marvels wrought!
2047,IV.,
2048,IV.,"As thus I mused, I was aware"
2049,IV.,There grew before my eager eyes
2050,IV.,"A little maid too bright and fair,"
2051,IV.,Too strangely lovely for surprise.
2052,IV.,It seemed the beauty of the place
2053,IV.,"Had suddenly become concrete,"
2054,IV.,"So full was she of Orient grace,"
2055,IV.,From her slant eyes and burnished face
2056,IV.,Down to her little gold-bronze feet.
2057,IV.,
2058,IV.,She was a girl of old Japan;
2059,IV.,"Her small hand held a gilded fan,"
2060,IV.,Which scattered fragrance through the room;
2061,IV.,"Her cheek was rich with pallid bloom,"
2062,IV.,"Her eye was dark with languid fire,"
2063,IV.,Her red lips breathed a vague desire;
2064,IV.,"Her teeth, of pearl inviolate,"
2065,IV.,Sweetly proclaimed her maiden state.
2066,IV.,Her garb was stiff with broidered gold
2067,IV.,"Twined with mysterious fold on fold,"
2068,IV.,"That gave no hint where, hidden well,"
2069,IV.,"Her dainty form might warmly dwell,--"
2070,IV.,A pearl within too large a shell.
2071,IV.,"So quaint, so short, so lissome, she,"
2072,IV.,It seemed as if it well might be
2073,IV.,"Some jocose god, with sportive whirl,"
2074,IV.,Had taken up a long lithe girl
2075,IV.,And tied a graceful knot in her.
2076,IV.,"I tried to speak, and found, oh, bliss!"
2077,IV.,I needed no interpreter;
2078,IV.,"I knew the Japanese for kiss,--"
2079,IV.,I had no other thought but this;
2080,IV.,"And she, with smile and blush divine,"
2081,IV.,Kind to my stammering prayer did seem;
2082,IV.,"My thought was hers, and hers was mine,"
2083,IV.,In the swift logic of my dream.
2084,IV.,"My arms clung round her slender waist,"
2085,IV.,"Through gold and silk the form I traced,"
2086,IV.,"And glad as rain that follows drouth,"
2087,IV.,I kissed and kissed her bright red mouth.
2088,IV.,
2089,IV.,What ailed the girl? No loving sigh
2090,IV.,Heaved the round bosom; in her eye
2091,IV.,Trembled no tear; from her dear throat
2092,IV.,Bubbled a sweet and silvery note
2093,IV.,"Of girlish laughter, shrill and clear,"
2094,IV.,That all the statues seemed to hear.
2095,IV.,The bronzes tinkled laughter fine;
2096,IV.,I heard a chuckle argentine
2097,IV.,Ring from the silver images;
2098,IV.,Even the ivory netsukes
2099,IV.,Uttered in every silent pause
2100,IV.,"Dry, bony laughs from tiny jaws;"
2101,IV.,The painted monkeys on the wall
2102,IV.,Waked up with chatter impudent;
2103,IV.,"Pottery, porcelain, bronze, and all"
2104,IV.,"Broke out in ghostly merriment,--"
2105,IV.,"Faint as rain pattering on dry leaves,"
2106,IV.,Or cricket's chirp on summer eves.
2107,IV.,
2108,IV.,And suddenly upon my sight
2109,IV.,"There grew a portent: left and right,"
2110,IV.,"On every side, as if the air"
2111,IV.,"Had taken substance then and there,"
2112,IV.,"In every sort of form and face,"
2113,IV.,A throng of tourists filled the place.
2114,IV.,I saw a Frenchman's sneering shrug;
2115,IV.,"A German countess, in one hand"
2116,IV.,"A sky-blue string which held a pug,"
2117,IV.,With the other a fiery face she fanned;
2118,IV.,A Yankee with a soft felt hat;
2119,IV.,A Coptic priest from Ararat;
2120,IV.,An English girl with cheeks of rose;
2121,IV.,A Nihilist with Socratic nose;
2122,IV.,Paddy from Cork with baggage light
2123,IV.,And pockets stuffed with dynamite;
2124,IV.,A haughty Southern Readjuster
2125,IV.,Wrapped in his pride and linen duster;
2126,IV.,Two noisy New York stock-brokèrs
2127,IV.,And twenty British globe-trottèrs.
2128,IV.,To my disgust and vast surprise
2129,IV.,"They turned on me lack-lustre eyes,"
2130,IV.,And each with dropped and wagging jaw
2131,IV.,Burst out into a wild guffaw:
2132,IV.,They laughed with huge mouths opened wide;
2133,IV.,They roared till each one held his side;
2134,IV.,"They screamed and writhed with brutal glee,"
2135,IV.,"With fingers rudely stretched to me,--"
2136,IV.,"Till lo! at once the laughter died,"
2137,IV.,The tourists faded into air;
2138,IV.,"None but my fair maid lingered there,"
2139,IV.,Who stood demurely by my side.
2140,IV.,"""Who were your friends?"" I asked the maid,"
2141,IV.,Taking a tea-cup from its shelf.
2142,IV.,"""This audience is disclosed,"" she said,"
2143,IV.,"""Whenever a man makes a fool of himself."""

2152,IV.,"For whether lying calm and beautiful,"
2153,IV.,"Clasping the earth in love, and throwing back"
2154,IV.,The smile of heaven from waves of amethyst;
2155,IV.,"Or whether, freshened by the busy winds,"
2156,IV.,It bears the trade and navies of the world
2157,IV.,To ends of use or stern activity;
2158,IV.,"Or whether, lashed by tempests, it gives way"
2159,IV.,"To elemental fury, howls and roars"
2160,IV.,"At all its rocky barriers, in wild lust"
2161,IV.,"Of ruin drinks the blood of living things,"
2162,IV.,"And strews its wrecks o'er leagues of desolate shore,--"
2163,IV.,"Always it is the sea, and men bow down"
2164,IV.,Before its vast and varied majesty.
2165,IV.,
2166,IV.,So all in vain will timorous ones essay
2167,IV.,To set the metes and bounds of Liberty.
2168,IV.,For Freedom is its own eternal law;
2169,IV.,"It makes its own conditions, and in storm"
2170,IV.,Or calm alike fulfills the unerring Will.
2171,IV.,Let us not then despise it when it lies
2172,IV.,"Still as a sleeping lion, while a swarm"
2173,IV.,Of gnat-like evils hover round its head;
2174,IV.,"Nor doubt it when in mad, disjointed times"
2175,IV.,"It shakes the torch of terror, and its cry"
2176,IV.,"Shrills o'er the quaking earth, and in the flame"
2177,IV.,Of riot and war we see its awful form
2178,IV.,"Rise by the scaffold, where the crimson axe"
2179,IV.,Rings down its grooves the knell of shuddering kings.
2180,IV.,"Forever in thine eyes, O Liberty,"
2181,IV.,"Shines that high light whereby the world is saved,"

2193,IV.,
2194,IV.,I meant to touch and test my fate;
2195,IV.,"That night I should divine,"
2196,IV.,"The moment I should see my love,"
2197,IV.,If her true heart were mine.
2198,IV.,
2199,IV.,"For if she holds me dear, I said,"
2200,IV.,She'll wear my blushing rose;
2201,IV.,"If not, she'll wear my cold Lamarque,"
2202,IV.,As white as winter's snows.
2203,IV.,
2204,IV.,My heart sank when I met her: sure
2205,IV.,"I had been overbold,"
2206,IV.,For on her breast my pale rose lay
2207,IV.,In virgin whiteness cold.
2208,IV.,
2209,IV.,"Yet with low words she greeted me,"
2210,IV.,With smiles divinely tender;

2222,IV.,And dear to her as the light of day.
2223,IV.,"She was so young, and he so fair,"
2224,IV.,The same bright eyes and the same dark hair;
2225,IV.,"To see them by the blossomy way,"
2226,IV.,They seemed two children at their play.
2227,IV.,
2228,IV.,"There came a death-dart from the sky,"
2229,IV.,Kilvani saw her darling die.
2230,IV.,"The glimmering shade his eyes invades,"
2231,IV.,Out of his cheek the red bloom fades;
2232,IV.,"His warm heart feels the icy chill,"
2233,IV.,"The round limbs shudder, and are still"
2234,IV.,And yet Kilvani held him fast
2235,IV.,"Long after life's last pulse was past,"
2236,IV.,As if her kisses could restore
2237,IV.,The smile gone out forevermore.
2238,IV.,
2239,IV.,"But when she saw her child was dead,"
2240,IV.,"She scattered ashes on her head,"
2241,IV.,"And seized the small corpse, pale and sweet,"
2242,IV.,"And rushing wildly through the street,"
2243,IV.,She sobbing fell at Buddha's feet.
2244,IV.,
2245,IV.,"""Master, all-helpful, help me now!"
2246,IV.,Here at thy feet I humbly bow;
2247,IV.,"Have mercy, Buddha, help me now!"""
2248,IV.,"She groveled on the marble floor,"
2249,IV.,And kissed the dead child o'er and o'er.
2250,IV.,And suddenly upon the air
2251,IV.,There fell the answer to her prayer:
2252,IV.,"""Bring me to-night a lotus tied"
2253,IV.,"With thread from a house where none has died."""
2254,IV.,
2255,IV.,"She rose, and laughed with thankful joy,"
2256,IV.,Sure that the god would save the boy.
2257,IV.,She found a lotus by the stream;
2258,IV.,She plucked it from its noonday dream.
2259,IV.,"And then from door to door she fared,"
2260,IV.,To ask what house by Death was spared.
2261,IV.,Her heart grew cold to see the eyes
2262,IV.,Of all dilate with slow surprise:
2263,IV.,"""Kilvani, thou hast lost thy head;"
2264,IV.,Nothing can help a child that's dead.
2265,IV.,There stands not by the Ganges' side
2266,IV.,"A house where none hath ever died."""
2267,IV.,"Thus, through the long and weary day,"
2268,IV.,From every door she bore away
2269,IV.,"Within her heart, and on her arm,"
2270,IV.,"A heavier load, a deeper harm."
2271,IV.,"By gates of gold and ivory,"
2272,IV.,"By wattled huts of poverty,"
2273,IV.,"The same refrain heard poor Kilvani,"
2274,IV.,"_The living are few, the dead are many._"
2275,IV.,
2276,IV.,The evening came--so still and fleet--
2277,IV.,And overtook her hurrying feet.
2278,IV.,"And, heartsick, by the sacred fane"
2279,IV.,"She fell, and prayed the god again."
2280,IV.,She sobbed and beat her bursting breast
2281,IV.,"""Ah, thou hast mocked me, Mightiest!"
2282,IV.,Lo! I have wandered far and wide;
2283,IV.,"There stands no house where none hath died."""
2284,IV.,"And Buddha answered, in a tone"
2285,IV.,"Soft as a flute at twilight blown,"
2286,IV.,But grand as heaven and strong as death
2287,IV.,To him who hears with ears of faith:
2288,IV.,"""Child, thou art answered. Murmur not!"
2289,IV.,"Bow, and accept the common lot."""
2290,IV.,
2291,IV.,"Kilvani heard with reverence meet,"

2307,IV.,"Stood in that wide, mysterious light,"

2309,IV.,"One on each hand, and high between"
2310,IV.,Shone forth the godlike Nazarene.
2311,IV.,
2312,IV.,"They bowed their heads in holy fright,--"
2313,IV.,"No mortal eyes could bear the sight,--"
2314,IV.,"And when they looked again, behold!"
2315,IV.,"The fiery clouds had backward rolled,"
2316,IV.,"And borne aloft in grandeur lonely,"
2317,IV.,"Nothing was left ""save Jesus only."""
2318,IV.,
2319,IV.,Resplendent type of things to be!
2320,IV.,We read its mystery to-day
2321,IV.,"With clearer eyes than even they,"
2322,IV.,The fisher-saints of Galilee.
2323,IV.,We see the Christ stand out between
2324,IV.,"The ancient law and faith serene,"
2325,IV.,Spirit and letter; but above
2326,IV.,Spirit and letter both was Love.
2327,IV.,"Led by the hand of Jacob's God,"
2328,IV.,Through wastes of eld a path was trod
2329,IV.,By which the savage world could move
2330,IV.,Upward through law and faith to love.
2331,IV.,And there in Tabor's harmless flame
2332,IV.,The crowning revelation came.
2333,IV.,"The old world knelt in homage due,"
2334,IV.,"The prophets near in reverence drew,"
2335,IV.,"Law ceased its mission to fulfill,"
2336,IV.,And Love was lord on Tabor's hill.
2337,IV.,
2338,IV.,"So now, while creeds perplex the mind"
2339,IV.,"And wranglings load the weary wind,"
2340,IV.,When all the air is filled with words
2341,IV.,"And texts that ring like clashing swords,"
2342,IV.,"Still, as for refuge, we may turn"
2343,IV.,"Where Tabor's shining glories burn,--"
2344,IV.,"The soul of antique Israel gone,"
2345,IV.,And nothing left but Christ alone.

2351,IV.,
2352,IV.,He stood before the Sanhedrim;
2353,IV.,The scowling rabbis gazed at him.
2354,IV.,He recked not of their praise or blame;
2355,IV.,"There was no fear, there was no shame,"
2356,IV.,For one upon whose dazzled eyes
2357,IV.,The whole world poured its vast surprise.
2358,IV.,"The open heaven was far too near,"
2359,IV.,"His first day's light too sweet and clear,"
2360,IV.,To let him waste his new-gained ken
2361,IV.,On the hate-clouded face of men.
2362,IV.,
2363,IV.,"But still they questioned, Who art thou?"
2364,IV.,What hast thou been? What art thou now?
2365,IV.,Thou art not he who yesterday
2366,IV.,Sat here and begged beside the way;
2367,IV.,For he was blind.
2368,IV.,--_And I am he;
2369,IV.,"For I was blind, but now I see_."
2370,IV.,
2371,IV.,He told the story o'er and o'er;
2372,IV.,It was his full heart's only lore:
2373,IV.,A prophet on the Sabbath-day
2374,IV.,"Had touched his sightless eyes with clay,"
2375,IV.,And made him see who had been blind.
2376,IV.,"Their words passed by him like the wind,"
2377,IV.,"Which raves and howls, but cannot shock"
2378,IV.,The hundred-fathom-rooted rock.
2379,IV.,
2380,IV.,Their threats and fury all went wide;
2381,IV.,They could not touch his Hebrew pride.
2382,IV.,"Their sneers at Jesus and His band,"
2383,IV.,"Nameless and homeless in the land,"

2391,IV.,
2392,IV.,"They were all doctors of renown,"

2395,IV.,Beneath their wide phylacteries;
2396,IV.,"The wisdom of the East was theirs,"
2397,IV.,And honor crowned their silver hairs.
2398,IV.,The man they jeered and laughed to scorn
2399,IV.,"Was unlearned, poor, and humbly born;"
2400,IV.,But he knew better far than they
2401,IV.,What came to him that Sabbath-day;
2402,IV.,And what the Christ had done for him

2423,IV.,"Each fault must bring its penance,"
2424,IV.,"Each sin the avenging blade,"
2425,IV.,For God upholds in justice
2426,IV.,The laws that He hath made.

2432,IV.,"To heal a sick world's trouble,"
2433,IV.,"To soothe its woe and pain,"

2438,IV.,"Its law in mercy furled,"

2440,IV.,O'erarched a drowning world.
2441,IV.,"The Law said, As you keep me,"
2442,IV.,It shall be done to you;
2443,IV.,"But Calvary prays, Forgive them;"
2444,IV.,They know not what they do.

2446,IV.,Almighty God! direct us
2447,IV.,To keep Thy perfect Law!

2463,IV.,We pray thee to rise and flee.

2469,IV.,
2470,IV.,Through the sleeping town St. Peter passed
2471,IV.,To the wide Campagna plain;
2472,IV.,In the starry light of the Alban night
2473,IV.,He drew free breath again:
2474,IV.,
2475,IV.,When across his path an awful form
2476,IV.,In luminous glory stood;
2477,IV.,"His thorn-crowned brow, His hands and feet,"
2478,IV.,Were wet with immortal blood.
2479,IV.,
2480,IV.,The godlike sorrow which filled His eyes
2481,IV.,"Seemed changed to a godlike wrath,"
2482,IV.,"As they turned on Peter, who cried aloud,"
2483,IV.,And sank to his knees in the path.
2484,IV.,
2485,IV.,"""Lord of my life, my love, my soul!"
2486,IV.,"Say, what wilt Thou with me?"""
2487,IV.,"A voice replied, ""I go to Rome"
2488,IV.,"To be crucified for thee."""
2489,IV.,
2490,IV.,"The apostle sprang, all flushed, to his feet,--"
2491,IV.,The vision had passed away;
2492,IV.,"The light still lay on the dewy plain,"
2493,IV.,But the sky in the east was gray.
2494,IV.,
2495,IV.,"To the city walls St. Peter turned,"
2496,IV.,And his heart in his breast grew fire;
2497,IV.,In every vein the hot blood burned
2498,IV.,With the strength of one high desire.
2499,IV.,
2500,IV.,And sturdily back he marched to his death

2511,IV.,"To learn on the morrow his doom,"
2512,IV.,And his dubious spirit debated
2513,IV.,"In darkness and silence and gloom,"
2514,IV.,There descended a Being with whom
2515,IV.,"He wrestled in agony sore,"
2516,IV.,"With striving of heart and of brawn,"
2517,IV.,And not for an instant forbore
2518,IV.,Till the east gave a threat of the dawn;
2519,IV.,"And then, as the Awful One blessed him,"
2520,IV.,"To his lips and his spirit there came,"
2521,IV.,"Compelled by the doubts that oppressed him,"
2522,IV.,The cry that through questioning ages
2523,IV.,"Has been wrung from the hinds and the sages,"

2536,IV.,"In the ages before our traditions,"

2538,IV.,The imperious question has come;
2539,IV.,When the death-stricken victim lay sobbing
2540,IV.,"At the feet of his slayer and priest,"
2541,IV.,And his heart was laid smoking and throbbing
2542,IV.,To the sound of the cymbal and drum
2543,IV.,On the steps of the high Teocallis;
2544,IV.,When the delicate Greek at his feast
2545,IV.,Poured forth the red wine from his chalice
2546,IV.,With mocking and cynical prayer;
2547,IV.,"When by Nile Egypt worshiping lay,"
2548,IV.,"And afar, through the rosy, flushed air"
2549,IV.,The Memnon called out to the day;
2550,IV.,Where the Muezzin's cry floats from his spire;
2551,IV.,"In the vaulted Cathedral's dim shades,"
2552,IV.,Where the crushed hearts of thousands aspire
2553,IV.,"Through art's highest miracles higher,"
2554,IV.,This question of questions invades
2555,IV.,Each heart bowed in worship or shame;
2556,IV.,"In the air where the censers are swinging,"
2557,IV.,"A voice, going up with the singing,"
2558,IV.,"Cries, ""Tell me, I pray Thee, Thy name!"""
2559,IV.,
2560,IV.,"No answer came back, not a word,"
2561,IV.,To the patriarch there by the ford;
2562,IV.,No answer has come through the ages

2565,IV.,"The name and the nature of God,"
2566,IV.,Whether cursing in desperate defiance
2567,IV.,Or kissing his absolute rod;
2568,IV.,"But the answer which was and shall be,"
2569,IV.,"""My name! Nay, what is it to thee?"""
2570,IV.,The search and the question are vain.
2571,IV.,"By use of the strength that is in you,"

3160,"ILLINOIS, 1858.","I kissed the little girl's lips, and alas!"
3161,"ILLINOIS, 1858.",I have roused a woman's wrath.

3166,"ILLINOIS, 1858.","From the proud, provoking head."
3167,"ILLINOIS, 1858.","And the beauty that flashed from the splendid eyes,"
3168,"ILLINOIS, 1858.","And played round the tender mouth,"
3169,"ILLINOIS, 1858.",Rushed over my soul like a warm sweet wind
3170,"ILLINOIS, 1858.",That blows from the fragrant south.
3171,"ILLINOIS, 1858.",
3172,"ILLINOIS, 1858.","And where, after all, is the harm done?"
3173,"ILLINOIS, 1858.","I believe we were made to be gay,"
3174,"ILLINOIS, 1858.",And all of youth not given to love
3175,"ILLINOIS, 1858.",Is vainly squandered away.
3176,"ILLINOIS, 1858.","And strewn through life's low labors,"

3186,"ILLINOIS, 1858.","At the sound of some vanished name,"
3187,"ILLINOIS, 1858.",The ghost of my kisses shall touch your lips

3244,"ILLINOIS, 1858.",
3245,"ILLINOIS, 1858.",God knows why this was not to be.

3727,XVIII.,"White throne of God, guard them from scathe and harm!"
3728,XVIII.,For in your starry records never shone
3729,XVIII.,The memory of desert so great as theirs.
3730,XVIII.,"I hold not first, though peerless else on earth,"
3731,XVIII.,"That knightly valor, born of gentle blood"
3732,XVIII.,"And war's long tutelage, which hath made their name"
3733,XVIII.,Blaze like a baleful planet o'er these lands;
3734,XVIII.,"Firm seat in saddle, lance unmoved, a hand"

3736,XVIII.,One-minded rush in fight that naught can stay.
3737,XVIII.,"Not these the highest, though I scorn not these,"

3739,XVIII.,The deeds that heaven hath given us arms to do.
3740,XVIII.,For when God's smile was with us we were strong

3742,XVIII.,As on that summer day when Saladin--
3743,XVIII.,"Passing in scorn our host at Antioch,"
3744,XVIII.,"Who spent the days in revel, and shamed the stars"
3745,XVIII.,"With nightly scandal--came with all his host,"
3746,XVIII.,"Its gay battalia brave with saffron silks,"

3749,XVIII.,"And white and shaking came the Leper-King,"
3750,XVIII.,"Great Baldwin's blasted scion, and Tripoli"
3751,XVIII.,"And I, and twenty score of Temple Knights,"
3752,XVIII.,To meet the myriads marshalled by the bright
3753,XVIII.,Untarnished flower of Eastern chivalry;
3754,XVIII.,A moment paused with level-fronting spears
3755,XVIII.,"And moveless helms before that shining host,"
3756,XVIII.,"Whose gay attire abashed the morning light,"
3757,XVIII.,"And then struck spur and charged, while from the mass"
3758,XVIII.,"Of rushing terror burst the awful cry,"
3759,XVIII.,_God and the Temple_! As the avalanche slides
3760,XVIII.,"Down Alpine slopes, precipitous, cold and dark,"
3761,XVIII.,"Unpitying and unwrathful, grinds and crushes"
3762,XVIII.,"The mountain violets and the valley weeds,"
3763,XVIII.,And drags behind a trail of chaos and death;
3764,XVIII.,"So burst we on that field, and through and through"
3765,XVIII.,"The gay battalia brave with saffron silks,"
3766,XVIII.,"Crushed and abolished every grace and gleam,"
3767,XVIII.,And dragged where'er we rode a sinuous track
3768,XVIII.,"Of chaos and death, till all the plain was filled"
3769,XVIII.,"With battered armor, turbaned trunkless heads,"
3770,XVIII.,With silken mantles blushing angry gules
3771,XVIII.,And Bagdad's banners trampled and forlorn.
3772,XVIII.,"And Saladin, stunned and bewildered sore,--"
3773,XVIII.,"The greatest prince, save in the grace of God,"
3774,XVIII.,"That now wears sword,--mounted his brother's barb,"
3775,XVIII.,"And, followed by a half-score followers,"
3776,XVIII.,"Sped to his castle Shaubec, over against"
3777,XVIII.,"The cliffs by Ascalon, and there abode:"
3778,XVIII.,And sullenly made order that no more
3779,XVIII.,The royal nouba should be played for him
3780,XVIII.,Until he should erase the rusting stain
3781,XVIII.,Upon his knightly honor; and no more
3782,XVIII.,"The nouba sounded by the Sultan's tent,"
3783,XVIII.,"Morning nor evening by the silent tent,"
3784,XVIII.,Until the headlong greed of Chatillon
3785,XVIII.,Spread ruin on our cause from Montreale.
3786,XVIII.,"But greatest are my warriors, as I deem,"
3787,XVIII.,"In that their hearts, nearer than any else"
3788,XVIII.,Keep true the pledge of perfect purity

3803,XVIII.,Glitters no flash of wreathen amulet
3804,XVIII.,Forged against sword-stroke by the chanted rhythm
3805,XVIII.,Of charms accurst; but in each steadfast heart
3806,XVIII.,"Blazes the light of cloudless purity,"
3807,XVIII.,That like a splendid jewel glorifies
3808,XVIII.,"With restless fire the gold that spheres it round,"
3809,XVIII.,"And marks you children of our God, whose lives"
3810,XVIII.,He guards with the awful jealousy of love.
3811,XVIII.,"And even me that generous love has spared,--"
3812,XVIII.,"Me, trustless knight and miserable man,--"
3813,XVIII.,Sad prey of dark and mutinous thoughts that tempt
3814,XVIII.,My sick soul into perjury and death--
3815,XVIII.,"Since his great love had pity of my pain,"
3816,XVIII.,Has spared to lead these blameless warriors safe
3817,XVIII.,"Into the desert from the blazing towns,"
3818,XVIII.,Out of the desert to the inviolate hills
3819,XVIII.,Where God has roofed them with his hollow shield.
3820,XVIII.,Through all these days of tempest and eclipse
3821,XVIII.,His hand has led me and his wrath has flashed
3822,XVIII.,Its lightnings in the pathway of my sword.
3823,XVIII.,"And so I hope, and so my crescent faith"
3824,XVIII.,"Gains daily power, that all my prayers and tears"
3825,XVIII.,And toils and blood and anguish borne for him
3826,XVIII.,May blot the accusing of my deadly sin
3827,XVIII.,"From heaven's high compt, and give me rest in death;"
3828,XVIII.,"And lay the pallid ghost of mortal love,"
3829,XVIII.,"That fills with banned and mournful loveliness,"
3830,XVIII.,"Unblest, the haunted chambers of my soul."
3831,XVIII.,"My misery will atone,--my misery,"
3832,XVIII.,"Dear God, will surely atone! for not the sting"
3833,XVIII.,"Of macerating thongs, nor the slow horror"
3834,XVIII.,"Of crowns of thorny iron maddening the brows,"
3835,XVIII.,Nor all that else pale hermits have devised
3836,XVIII.,To scourge the rebel senses in their shade
3837,XVIII.,"Of caverned desolation, have the power"
3838,XVIII.,To smart and goad and lash and mortify
3839,XVIII.,Like the great love that binds my ruined heart
3840,XVIII.,"Relentless, as the insidious ivy binds"
3841,XVIII.,"The shattered bulk of some deserted tower,"
3842,XVIII.,Enlacing slow and riving with strong hands
3843,XVIII.,"Of pitiless verdure every seam and jut,"
3844,XVIII.,Till none may tear it forth and save the tower.
3845,XVIII.,So binds and masters me my hopeless love.
3846,XVIII.,"So through the desert, in the silent hills,"
3847,XVIII.,"I' the current of the battle's storm and stress,"
3848,XVIII.,"One thought has driven me,--that though men may call"
3849,XVIII.,"Me stainless Paladin, Knight leal and true"
3850,XVIII.,"To Christ and Our Lady, still I know myself"
3851,XVIII.,"A knight not after God's own heart, a soul"
3852,XVIII.,"Recreant, and whelmed in the forbidden sin."
3853,XVIII.,For dearer to my sad heart than the cross
3854,XVIII.,I give my heart's best blood for are the eyes
3855,XVIII.,"That long ago, when youth and hope were mine,"
3856,XVIII.,"I loved in thy still valleys, far Provence!"
3857,XVIII.,And sweeter to my spirit than the bells
3858,XVIII.,Of rescued Salem are the loving tones
3859,XVIII.,"Of her dear voice, soft echoing o'er the years."
3860,XVIII.,They haunt me in the stillness and the glare
3861,XVIII.,Of desert noontide when the horizon's line
3862,XVIII.,"Swims faintly throbbing, and my shadow hides"
3863,XVIII.,Skulking beneath me from the brassy sky.
3864,XVIII.,And when night comes to soothe with breath of balm
3865,XVIII.,"And pomp of stars the worn and weary world,"
3866,XVIII.,Her eyes rise in my soul and make its day.
3867,XVIII.,"And even into the battle comes my love,"
3868,XVIII.,Snatching the duty that I offer Heaven.
3869,XVIII.,
3870,XVIII.,"At closing of El-Majed's awful day,"
3871,XVIII.,"When the last quivering sunbeams, choked with dust"
3872,XVIII.,"And fume of blood, failed on the level plain,"
3873,XVIII.,"In the last charge, when gathered all our knights"
3874,XVIII.,The precious handful who from morn had stemmed
3875,XVIII.,The fury of the multitudinous hosts
3876,XVIII.,"Of Islam, where in youth's hot fire and pride"
3877,XVIII.,"Ramped the young lion-whelp, Ben-Saladin;"
3878,XVIII.,"As down the slope we rode at eventide,"
3879,XVIII.,The dying sunlight faintly smiled to greet
3880,XVIII.,Our tattered guidons and our dinted helms
3881,XVIII.,And lance-heads blooming with the battle's rose.
3882,XVIII.,"Into the vale, dusk with the shadow of death,"
3883,XVIII.,With silent lips and ringing mail we rode.
3884,XVIII.,"And something in the spirit of the hour,"
3885,XVIII.,"Or fate, or memory, or sorrow, or sin,"
3886,XVIII.,"Or love, which unto me is all of these,"
3887,XVIII.,Possessed and bound me; for when dashed our troop
3888,XVIII.,In stormy clangor on the Paynim lines
3889,XVIII.,The soul of my dead youth came into me;
3890,XVIII.,"Faded away my oath; the woes of Zion,"
3891,XVIII.,"God was forgot; blazed in my leaping heart,"
3892,XVIII.,"With instant flash, life's inextinguished fires;"
3893,XVIII.,Plunging along each tense limb poured the blood
3894,XVIII.,Hot with its years of sleeping-smothered flame.
3895,XVIII.,"And in a dream I charged, and in a dream"
3896,XVIII.,I smote resistless; foemen in my path
3897,XVIII.,"Fell unregarded, like the wayside flowers"
3898,XVIII.,Clipped by the truant's staff in daisied lanes.
3899,XVIII.,For over me burned lustrous the dear eyes
3900,XVIII.,Of my beloved; I strove as at a joust
3901,XVIII.,To gain at end the guerdon of her smile.
3902,XVIII.,"And ever, as in the dense melee I dashed,"
3903,XVIII.,"Her name burst from my lips, as lightning breaks"
3904,XVIII.,Out of the plunging wrack of summer storms.
3905,XVIII.,
3906,XVIII.,O my lost love! Bright o'er the waste of years--
3907,XVIII.,That bliss and beauty shines upon my soul;
3908,XVIII.,"As far beyond yon desert hangs the sun,"
3909,XVIII.,Gilding with tender beam the barren stretch
3910,XVIII.,Of sands that intervene. In this still light
3911,XVIII.,The old sweet memories glimmer back to me.
3912,XVIII.,"Fair summers of my youth,--the idle days"
3913,XVIII.,I wandered in the bosky coverts hid
3914,XVIII.,In the dim woods that girt my ancient home;
3915,XVIII.,The blue young eyes I met and worshipped there;
3916,XVIII.,The love that growing turned those gloomy wilds
3917,XVIII.,"To faery dells, and filled the vernal air"
3918,XVIII.,With light that bathed the hills of Paradise;
3919,XVIII.,"The warm, long days of rapturous summer-time,"
3920,XVIII.,"When through the forests thick and lush we strayed,"
3921,XVIII.,And love made our own sunshine in the shades.
3922,XVIII.,And all things fair and graceful in the woods
3923,XVIII.,I loved with liberal heart; the violets
3924,XVIII.,"Were dear for her dear eyes, the quiring birds"
3925,XVIII.,That caught the musical tremble of her voice.
3926,XVIII.,O happy twilights in the leafy glooms!
3927,XVIII.,When in the glowing dusk the winsome arts
3928,XVIII.,And maiden graces that all day had kept
3929,XVIII.,Us twain and separate melted away
3930,XVIII.,"In blushing silence, and my love was mine"
3931,XVIII.,"Utterly, utterly, with clinging arms"
3932,XVIII.,"And quick, caressing fingers, warm red lips,"
3933,XVIII.,"Where vows, half uttered, drowned in kisses, died;"
3934,XVIII.,"Mine, with the starlight in her passionate eyes;"
3935,XVIII.,The wild wind of the woodland breathing low
3936,XVIII.,"To wake the elfin music of the leaves,"
3937,XVIII.,"And free the prisoned odors of the flowers,"
3938,XVIII.,In honor of young Love come to his throne!
3939,XVIII.,"While we under the stars, with twining arms"
3940,XVIII.,"And mutual lips insatiate, gave our souls--"
3941,XVIII.,Madly forgetting earth and heaven--to love!
3942,XVIII.,
3943,XVIII.,"_In desert march or battles flame,"
3944,XVIII.,"In fortress and in field,"
3945,XVIII.,"Our war-cry is thy holy name,"
3946,XVIII.,Thy love our joy and shield!
3947,XVIII.,"And if we falter, let thy power"

3949,XVIII.,And God forget us in the hour
3950,XVIII.,We cease to think of thee!_
3951,XVIII.,
3952,XVIII.,"Curse me not, God of Justice and of Love!"
3953,XVIII.,"Pitiful God, let my long woe atone!"
3954,XVIII.,
3955,XVIII.,I cannot deem but God has pitied me;
3956,XVIII.,"Else why with painful care have I been saved,"

3959,XVIII.,"Of Jaffa, on the sands of far Daroum,"

3963,XVIII.,For never a storm of fatal fight has raged

3968,XVIII.,"At Marcab's lingering siege, where day by day"
3969,XVIII.,"We told the Moslem legions toiling slow,"

3971,XVIII.,To quench in our destruction this last light
3972,XVIII.,"Of Christendom, our fortress in the crags,"
3973,XVIII.,God's beacon swung defiant from the stars;
3974,XVIII.,One thunderous night I knew their miners groped
3975,XVIII.,"Below, and thought ere morn to die, in crush"
3976,XVIII.,And tumult of the falling citadel.
3977,XVIII.,And pondering of my fate--the broken storm
3978,XVIII.,Sobbing its life away--I was aware
3979,XVIII.,There grew between me and the quieting skies
3980,XVIII.,"A face and form I knew,--not as in dreams,"
3981,XVIII.,"The sad dishevelled loveliness of earth,"
3982,XVIII.,"But lighter than the thin air where she swayed,--"
3983,XVIII.,"Gold hair flame-fluttered, eyes and mouth aglow"
3984,XVIII.,With lambent light of spiritual joy.
3985,XVIII.,With sweet command she beckoned me away
3986,XVIII.,"And led me vaguely dreaming, till I saw"
3987,XVIII.,Where the wild flood in sudden fury had burst
3988,XVIII.,A passage through the rocks: and thence I led
3989,XVIII.,"My host unharmed, following her luminous eyes,"
3990,XVIII.,"Until the East was gray, and with a smile"
3991,XVIII.,Wooing me heavenward still she passed away
3992,XVIII.,Into the rosy trouble of the dawn.
3993,XVIII.,
3994,XVIII.,"And I believe my love is shrived in heaven,"
3995,XVIII.,And I believe that I shall soon be free.
3996,XVIII.,
3997,XVIII.,"For ever, as I journey on, to me"

4001,XVIII.,And ghostly gales come blowing o'er my soul
4002,XVIII.,Fraught with the amaranth odors of the skies.
4003,XVIII.,"I go to join the Lion-Heart at Acre,"
4004,XVIII.,"And there, after due homage to my liege,"

4006,XVIII.,"And after final devoir in the fight,"
4007,XVIII.,"If that my God be gracious, I shall die."
4008,XVIII.,And so I pray--Lord pardon if I sin!--
4009,XVIII.,"That I may lose in death's imbittered wave,"
4010,XVIII.,"The stain of sinful loving, and may find"
