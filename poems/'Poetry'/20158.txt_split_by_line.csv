13,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,This etext contains only characters from the Latin-1 set. The original
14,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,work contained a few phrases or lines of Greek text. These are
15,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"represented here as Beta-code transliterations in brackets, for example"
16,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,[Greek: Oi~moi].
17,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,
18,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,The original text used a few other characters not found in the Latin-1
19,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"set. These have been represented using bracket notation, as follows:"
20,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"[=e], [=i], [=N], [=S] represent those letters with a macron (bar)"
21,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,above; [)i] represents and i with a breve (curved line). In a few places
22,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"superscript letters are shown by carets, as in May 27^th^."
23,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,
24,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,An important feature of this edition is its copious footnotes. Footnotes
25,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"indexed with letters (e.g. [c], [bf]) show variant forms of Byron's text"
26,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,from manuscripts and other sources. Footnotes indexed with arabic
27,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"numbers (e.g. [17], [221]) are informational. Text in notes and"
28,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,elsewhere in square brackets is the work of editor E. H. Coleridge. Text
29,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,not in brackets is by Byron himself.
30,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,
31,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"In the original, footnotes were printed at the foot of the page on which"
32,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"they were referenced, and their indices started over on each page. In"
33,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"this etext, footnotes have been collected at the ends of each section,"
34,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,and have been consecutively numbered throughout. Within each block of
35,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,footnotes are numbers in braces: {321}. These represent the page number
36,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,on which following notes originally appeared. To find a note that was
37,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"originally printed on page 27, search for {27}."
38,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,
39,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"In the work ""Francesca di Rimini"" the original printed lines of the"
40,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,Italian on facing pages opposite the matching lines of Byron's
41,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"translation. In this etext, the lines of the Italian original have been"
42,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,collected following the translation.
43,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,
44,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"Two minor corrections were made in this etext, both in the note following"
45,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"the title of MANFRED: the year 1348 was corrected to 1834, and the word"
46,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"""Tschairowsky"" was corrected to ""Tschaikowsky."""

81,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.
82,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,
83,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,
84,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,The poems included in this volume consist of thirteen longer or more
85,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"important works, written at various periods between June, 1816, and"
86,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"October, 1821; of eight occasional pieces (_Poems of July-September_,"
87,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"1816), written in 1816; and of another collection of occasional pieces"
88,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"(_Poems_ 1816-1823), written at intervals between November, 1816, and"
89,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"September, 1823. Of this second group of minor poems five are now"
90,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,printed and published for the first time.
91,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,
92,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,The volume is not co-extensive with the work of the period. The third
93,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"and fourth cantos of _Childe Harold_ (1816-1817), the first five cantos"
94,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"of _Don Juan_ (1818, 1819, 1820), _Sardanapalus_, _The Two Foscari_,"
95,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"_Cain_, and _Heaven and Earth_ (1821), form parts of other volumes, but,"
96,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"in spite of these notable exceptions, the fourth volume contains the"
97,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"work of the poet's maturity, which is and must ever remain famous. Byron"
98,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"was not content to write on one kind of subject, or to confine himself"
99,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,to one branch or species of poetry. He tracked the footsteps now of this
100,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"master poet, now of another, far outstripping some of his models; soon"
101,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"spent in the pursuit of others. Even in his own lifetime, and in the"
102,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"heyday of his fame, his friendliest critics, who applauded him to the"
103,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"echo, perceived that the ""manifold motions"" of his versatile and"
104,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,unsleeping talent were not always sanctioned or blessed by his genius.
105,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"Hence the unevenness of his work, the different values of this or that"
106,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"poem. But, even so, in width of compass, in variety of style, and in"
107,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"measure of success, his achievement was unparalleled. Take such poems as"
108,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"_Manfred_ or _Mazeppa_, which have left their mark on the literature of"
109,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"Europe; as _Beppo_, the _avant courrier_ of _Don Juan_, or the"
110,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"""inimitable"" _Vision of Judgment_, which the ""hungry generations"" have"
111,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,not trodden down or despoiled of its freshness. Not one of these poems
112,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"suggests or resembles the other, but each has its crowd of associations,"
113,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,a history and almost a literature of its own.
114,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,
115,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"The whole of this volume was written on foreign soil, in Switzerland or"
116,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"Italy, and, putting aside _The Dream_, _The Monody on the Death of"
117,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"Sheridan_, _The Irish Avatar_, and _The Blues_, the places, the persons"
118,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"and events, the _matériel_ of the volume as a whole, to say nothing of"
119,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"the style and metre of the poems, are derived from the history and the"
120,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"literature of Switzerland and Southern Europe. An unwilling, at times a"
121,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"vindictive exile, he did more than any other poet or writer of his age"
122,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"to familiarize his own countrymen with the scenery, the art and letters"
123,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"of the Continent, and, conversely, to make the existence of English"
124,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"literature, or, at least, the writings of one Englishman, known to"
125,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"Frenchmen and Italians; to the Teuton and the Slav. If he ""taught us"
126,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"little"" as prophet or moralist; as a guide to knowledge; as an educator"
127,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"of the general reader--""your British blackguard,"" as he was pleased to"
128,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"call him--his teaching and influence were ""in widest commonalty spread."""
129,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,
130,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"Questions with regard to his personality, his morals, his theological"
131,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"opinions, his qualifications as an artist, his grammar, his technique,"
132,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"and so forth, have, perhaps inevitably, absorbed the attention of friend"
133,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"and foe, and the one point on which all might agree has been overlooked,"
134,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"namely, the fact that he taught us a great deal which it is desirable"
135,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,and agreeable to know--which has passed into common knowledge through
136,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,the medium of his poetry. It is true that he wrote his plays and poems
137,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"at lightning speed, and that if he was at pains to correct some obvious"
138,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"blunders, he expended but little labour on picking his phrases or"
139,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,polishing his lines; but it is also true that he read widely and studied
140,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"diligently, in order to prepare himself for an outpouring of verse, and"
141,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"that so far from being a superficial observer or inaccurate recorder,"
142,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,his authority is worth quoting in questions of fact and points of
143,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,detail.
144,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,
145,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"The appreciation of poetry is a matter of taste, and still more of"
146,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"temperament. Readers cannot be coerced into admiration, or scolded into"
147,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,disapproval and contempt. But if they are willing or can be persuaded to
148,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,read with some particularity and attention the writings of the
149,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"illustrious dead, not entirely as partisans, or with the view to"
150,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"dethroning other ""Monarchs of Parnassus,"" they will divine the secret of"
151,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"their fame, and will understand, perhaps recover, the ""first rapture"" of"
152,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,contemporaries.
153,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,
154,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"Byron sneered and carped at Southey as a ""scribbler of all works."" He"
155,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,"was himself a reader of all works, and without some measure of"
156,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,book-learning and not a little research the force and significance of
157,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,his various numbers are weakened or obliterated.
158,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,
159,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,It is with the hope of supplying this modicum of book-learning that the
160,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.,Introductions and notes in this and other volumes have been compiled.

779,VII.,"Which in a palace had grown cold,"
780,VII.,Had his free breathing been denied

789,VII.,Even from the cold earth of our cave.
790,VII.,"I begged them, as a boon, to lay"
791,VII.,His corse in dust whereon the day

794,VII.,That even in death his freeborn breast
795,VII.,In such a dungeon could not rest.
796,VII.,I might have spared my idle prayer--
797,VII.,They coldly laughed--and laid him there:
798,VII.,The flat and turfless earth above                                  160
799,VII.,The being we so much did love;

817,VIII.,"Oh, God! it is a fearful thing"
818,VIII.,To see the human soul take wing
819,VIII.,"In any shape, in any mood:[19]"
820,VIII.,"I've seen it rushing forth in blood,"
821,VIII.,I've seen it on the breaking ocean                                 180

833,VIII.,Whose tints as gently sunk away

838,VIII.,"A groan o'er his untimely lot,--"
839,VIII.,"A little talk of better days,"
840,VIII.,"A little hope my own to raise,"

843,VIII.,And then the sighs he would suppress

1453,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"July 22 and July 29), is a retrospect and an apology. It consists of an"
1454,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"opening stanza, or section, on the psychology of dreams, followed by"
1455,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"some episodes or dissolving views, which purport to be the successive"
1456,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,stages of a dream. Stanzas ii. and iii. are descriptive of Annesley Park
1457,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"and Hall, and detail two incidents of Byron's boyish passion for his"
1458,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"neighbour and distant cousin, Mary Anne Chaworth. The first scene takes"
1459,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"place on the top of ""Diadem Hill,"" the ""cape"" or rounded spur of the"
1460,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"long ridge of Howatt Hill, which lies about half a mile to the"
1461,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,south-east of the hall. The time is the late summer or early autumn of
1462,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"1803. The ""Sun of Love"" has not yet declined, and the ""one beloved face"""
1463,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"is still shining on him; but he is beginning to realize that ""her sighs"
1464,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"are not for him,"" that she is out of his reach. The second scene, which"
1465,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"belongs to the following year, 1804, is laid in the ""antique oratory"""
1466,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"(not, as Moore explains, another name for the hall, but ""a small room"
1467,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"built over the porch, or principal entrance of the hall, and looking"
1468,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"into the courtyard""), and depicts the final parting. His doom has been"
1469,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"pronounced, and his first impulse is to pen some passionate reproach,"
1470,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"but his heart fails him at the sight of the ""Lady of his Love,"" serene"

1495,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,
1496,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"Moore says (_Life_, p. 321) that _The Dream_ cost its author ""many a"
1497,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"tear in writing""--being, indeed, the most mournful as well as"
1498,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"picturesque ""story of a wandering life"" that ever came from the pen and"
1499,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,heart of man. In his _Real Lord Byron_ (i. 284) Mr. Cordy Jeaffreson
1500,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"maintains that _The Dream_ ""has no autobiographical value.... A dream it"
1501,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"was, as false as dreams usually are."" The character of the poet, as well"
1502,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"as the poem itself, suggests another criticism. Byron suffered or"
1503,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"enjoyed vivid dreams, and, as poets will, shaped his dreams, consciously"
1504,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"and of set purpose, to the furtherance of his art, but nothing"
1505,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,concerning himself interested him or awoke the slumbering chord which
1506,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"was not based on actual fact. If the meeting on the ""cape crowned with a"
1507,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"peculiar diadem,"" and the final interview in the ""antique oratory"" had"
1508,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"never happened or happened otherwise; if he had not ""quivered"" during"
1509,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,the wedding service at Seaham; if a vision of Annesley and Mary Chaworth
1510,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"had not flashed into his soul,--he would have taken no pleasure in"
1511,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"devising these incidents and details, and weaving them into a fictitious"
1512,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,narrative. He took himself too seriously to invent and dwell lovingly on
1513,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,the acts and sufferings of an imaginary Byron. The Dream is
1514,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"""picturesque"" because the accidents of the scenes are dealt with not"
1515,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"historically, but artistically, are omitted or supplied according to"
1516,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"poetical licence; but the record is neither false, nor imaginary, nor"
1517,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"unusual. On the other hand, the composition and publication of the poem"
1518,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"must be set down, if not to malice and revenge, at least to the"
1519,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"preoccupancy of chagrin and remorse, which compelled him to take the"
1520,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,"world into his confidence, cost what it might to his own self-respect,"
1521,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DREAM_,or the peace of mind and happiness of others.

1601,II.,And his cheek change tempestuously--his heart                       60
1602,II.,Unknowing of its cause of agony.
1603,II.,But she in these fond feelings had no share:
1604,II.,Her sighs were not for him; to her he was
1605,II.,"Even as a brother--but no more; 'twas much,"
1606,II.,"For brotherless she was, save in the name"
1607,II.,Her infant friendship had bestowed on him;
1608,II.,Herself the solitary scion left
1609,II.,Of a time-honoured race.[42]--It was a name
1610,II.,"Which pleased him, and yet pleased him not--and why?"
1611,II.,Time taught him a deep answer--when she loved                       70
1612,II.,"Another: even _now_ she loved another,"
1613,II.,And on the summit of that hill she stood
1614,II.,Looking afar if yet her lover's steed[43]
1615,II.,"Kept pace with her expectancy, and flew."
1616,II.,
1617,III.,III.
1618,III.,
1619,III.,A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.
1620,III.,"There was an ancient mansion, and before"
1621,III.,Its walls there was a steed caparisoned:
1622,III.,Within an antique Oratory stood
1623,III.,"The Boy of whom I spake;--he was alone,[44]"
1624,III.,"And pale, and pacing to and fro: anon                               80"
1625,III.,"He sate him down, and seized a pen, and traced"
1626,III.,Words which I could not guess of; then he leaned
1627,III.,"His bowed head on his hands, and shook as 'twere"
1628,III.,"With a convulsion--then arose again,"
1629,III.,And with his teeth and quivering hands did tear
1630,III.,"What he had written, but he shed no tears."
1631,III.,"And he did calm himself, and fix his brow"
1632,III.,"Into a kind of quiet: as he paused,"
1633,III.,The Lady of his love re-entered there;
1634,III.,"She was serene and smiling then, and yet                            90"
1635,III.,"She knew she was by him beloved--she knew,"
1636,III.,"For quickly comes such knowledge,[45] that his heart"
1637,III.,"Was darkened with her shadow, and she saw"
1638,III.,"That he was wretched, but she saw not all."
1639,III.,"He rose, and with a cold and gentle grasp"
1640,III.,He took her hand; a moment o'er his face
1641,III.,A tablet of unutterable thoughts
1642,III.,"Was traced, and then it faded, as it came;"
1643,III.,"He dropped the hand he held, and with slow steps"
1644,III.,"Retired, but not as bidding her adieu,                             100"
1645,III.,For they did part with mutual smiles; he passed
1646,III.,"From out the massy gate of that old Hall,"
1647,III.,And mounting on his steed he went his way;
1648,III.,And ne'er repassed that hoary threshold more.[46]
1649,III.,
1650,IV.,IV.
1651,IV.,
1652,IV.,A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.
1653,IV.,The Boy was sprung to manhood: in the wilds
1654,IV.,"Of fiery climes he made himself a home,"
1655,IV.,And his Soul drank their sunbeams: he was girt
1656,IV.,With strange and dusky aspects; he was not
1657,IV.,Himself like what he had been; on the sea                          110
1658,IV.,And on the shore he was a wanderer;
1659,IV.,There was a mass of many images
1660,IV.,"Crowded like waves upon me, but he was"
1661,IV.,A part of all; and in the last he lay
1662,IV.,"Reposing from the noontide sultriness,"
1663,IV.,"Couched among fallen columns, in the shade"
1664,IV.,Of ruined walls that had survived the names
1665,IV.,Of those who reared them; by his sleeping side
1666,IV.,"Stood camels grazing, and some goodly steeds"
1667,IV.,Were fastened near a fountain; and a man                           120
1668,IV.,"Clad in a flowing garb did watch the while,"
1669,IV.,While many of his tribe slumbered around:
1670,IV.,"And they were canopied by the blue sky,"
1671,IV.,"So cloudless, clear, and purely beautiful,"
1672,IV.,That God alone was to be seen in Heaven.[47]
1673,IV.,
1674,V.,V.
1675,V.,
1676,V.,A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.
1677,V.,The Lady of his love was wed with One
1678,V.,"Who did not love her better:--in her home,"
1679,V.,"A thousand leagues from his,--her native home,"
1680,V.,"She dwelt, begirt with growing Infancy,                            130"
1681,V.,"Daughters and sons of Beauty,--but behold!"
1682,V.,"Upon her face there was the tint of grief,"
1683,V.,"The settled shadow of an inward strife,"
1684,V.,"And an unquiet drooping of the eye,"
1685,V.,As if its lid were charged with unshed tears.[48]
1686,V.,"What could her grief be?--she had all she loved,"
1687,V.,And he who had so loved her was not there
1688,V.,"To trouble with bad hopes, or evil wish,"
1689,V.,"Or ill-repressed affliction, her pure thoughts."
1690,V.,"What could her grief be?--she had loved him not,                   140"
1691,V.,"Nor given him cause to deem himself beloved,"
1692,V.,Nor could he be a part of that which preyed
1693,V.,Upon her mind--a spectre of the past.
1694,V.,
1695,VI.,VI.
1696,VI.,
1697,VI.,A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.
1698,VI.,The Wanderer was returned.--I saw him stand
1699,VI.,Before an Altar--with a gentle bride;
1700,VI.,"Her face was fair, but was not that which made"
1701,VI.,The Starlight[49] of his Boyhood;--as he stood
1702,VI.,"Even at the altar, o'er his brow there came"
1703,VI.,"The self-same aspect, and the quivering shock[50]                  150"
1704,VI.,That in the antique Oratory shook
1705,VI.,His bosom in its solitude; and then--
1706,VI.,As in that hour--a moment o'er his face
1707,VI.,The tablet of unutterable thoughts
1708,VI.,"Was traced,--and then it faded as it came,"
1709,VI.,"And he stood calm and quiet, and he spoke"
1710,VI.,"The fitting vows, but heard not his own words,"
1711,VI.,And all things reeled around him; he could see
1712,VI.,"Not that which was, nor that which should have been--"
1713,VI.,"But the old mansion, and the accustomed hall,                      160"
1714,VI.,"And the remembered chambers, and the place,"
1715,VI.,"The day, the hour, the sunshine, and the shade,"
1716,VI.,All things pertaining to that place and hour
1717,VI.,"And her who was his destiny, came back"
1718,VI.,And thrust themselves between him and the light:
1719,VI.,What business had they there at such a time?
1720,VI.,
1721,VII.,VII.
1722,VII.,
1723,VII.,A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.
1724,VII.,The Lady of his love;--Oh! she was changed
1725,VII.,As by the sickness of the soul; her mind
1726,VII.,"Had wandered from its dwelling, and her eyes                       170"
1727,VII.,"They had not their own lustre, but the look"
1728,VII.,Which is not of the earth; she was become
1729,VII.,The Queen of a fantastic realm; her thoughts
1730,VII.,Were combinations of disjointed things;
1731,VII.,"And forms, impalpable and unperceived"
1732,VII.,"Of others' sight, familiar were to hers."
1733,VII.,And this the world calls frenzy; but the wise
1734,VII.,Have a far deeper madness--and the glance
1735,VII.,Of melancholy is a fearful gift;
1736,VII.,What is it but the telescope of truth?                             180
1737,VII.,"Which strips the distance of its fantasies,"
1738,VII.,"And brings life near in utter nakedness,"
1739,VII.,Making the cold reality too real![j][51]
1740,VII.,
1741,VIII.,VIII.
1742,VIII.,
1743,VIII.,A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.
1744,VIII.,"The Wanderer was alone as heretofore,"
1745,VIII.,"The beings which surrounded him were gone,"
1746,VIII.,Or were at war with him; he was a mark
1747,VIII.,"For blight and desolation, compassed round"
1748,VIII.,With Hatred and Contention; Pain was mixed
1749,VIII.,"In all which was served up to him, until,                          190"
1750,VIII.,"Like to the Pontic monarch of old days,[52]"
1751,VIII.,"He fed on poisons, and they had no power,"
1752,VIII.,But were a kind of nutriment; he lived
1753,VIII.,"Through that which had been death to many men,"
1754,VIII.,And made him friends of mountains:[53] with the stars
1755,VIII.,And the quick Spirit of the Universe[54]
1756,VIII.,He held his dialogues; and they did teach
1757,VIII.,To him the magic of their mysteries;
1758,VIII.,"To him the book of Night was opened wide,"
1759,VIII.,And voices from the deep abyss revealed[55]                        200
1760,VIII.,A marvel and a secret--Be it so.
1761,VIII.,
1762,IX.,IX.
1763,IX.,
1764,IX.,My dream was past; it had no further change.
1765,IX.,"It was of a strange order, that the doom"
1766,IX.,Of these two creatures should be thus traced out
1767,IX.,Almost like a reality--the one
1768,IX.,To end in madness--both in misery.

1784,IX.,"Morn came and went--and came, and brought no day,"

1786,IX.,Of this their desolation; and all hearts
1787,IX.,Were chilled into a selfish prayer for light:

1793,IX.,To look once more into each other's face;
1794,IX.,Happy were those who dwelt within the eye
1795,IX.,"Of the volcanos, and their mountain-torch:"
1796,IX.,A fearful hope was all the World contained;
1797,IX.,Forests were set on fire--but hour by hour
1798,IX.,They fell and faded--and the crackling trunks                       20
1799,IX.,Extinguished with a crash--and all was black.
1800,IX.,The brows of men by the despairing light
1801,IX.,"Wore an unearthly aspect, as by fits"

1809,IX.,"With curses cast them down upon the dust,"
1810,IX.,"And gnashed their teeth and howled: the wild birds shrieked,"
1811,IX.,"And, terrified, did flutter on the ground,"
1812,IX.,And flap their useless wings; the wildest brutes
1813,IX.,Came tame and tremulous; and vipers crawled
1814,IX.,"And twined themselves among the multitude,"
1815,IX.,"Hissing, but stingless--they were slain for food:"
1816,IX.,"And War, which for a moment was no more,"
1817,IX.,Did glut himself again:--a meal was bought
1818,IX.,"With blood, and each sate sullenly apart                            40"
1819,IX.,Gorging himself in gloom: no Love was left;
1820,IX.,"All earth was but one thought--and that was Death,"
1821,IX.,Immediate and inglorious; and the pang
1822,IX.,Of famine fed upon all entrails--men
1823,IX.,"Died, and their bones were tombless as their flesh;"
1824,IX.,"The meagre by the meagre were devoured,"
1825,IX.,"Even dogs assailed their masters, all save one,"
1826,IX.,"And he was faithful to a corse, and kept"
1827,IX.,"The birds and beasts and famished men at bay,"
1828,IX.,"Till hunger clung them,[57] or the dropping dead                    50"
1829,IX.,"Lured their lank jaws; himself sought out no food,"
1830,IX.,"But with a piteous and perpetual moan,"
1831,IX.,"And a quick desolate cry, licking the hand"
1832,IX.,Which answered not with a caress--he died.
1833,IX.,The crowd was famished by degrees; but two
1834,IX.,"Of an enormous city did survive,"
1835,IX.,And they were enemies: they met beside
1836,IX.,The dying embers of an altar-place
1837,IX.,Where had been heaped a mass of holy things
1838,IX.,"For an unholy usage; they raked up,                                 60"
1839,IX.,And shivering scraped with their cold skeleton hands
1840,IX.,"The feeble ashes, and their feeble breath"
1841,IX.,"Blew for a little life, and made a flame"
1842,IX.,Which was a mockery; then they lifted up
1843,IX.,"Their eyes as it grew lighter, and beheld[58]"
1844,IX.,"Each other's aspects--saw, and shrieked, and died--"
1845,IX.,"Even of their mutual hideousness they died,"
1846,IX.,Unknowing who he was upon whose brow
1847,IX.,"Famine had written Fiend. The World was void,"
1848,IX.,"The populous and the powerful was a lump,                           70"
1849,IX.,"Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless--"
1850,IX.,A lump of death--a chaos of hard clay.
1851,IX.,"The rivers, lakes, and ocean all stood still,"
1852,IX.,And nothing stirred within their silent depths;
1853,IX.,"Ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea,"
1854,IX.,And their masts fell down piecemeal: as they dropped
1855,IX.,They slept on the abyss without a surge--
1856,IX.,"The waves were dead; the tides were in their grave,"
1857,IX.,"The Moon, their mistress, had expired before;"
1858,IX.,"The winds were withered in the stagnant air,                        80"

3637,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,
3638,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"_Manfred_ was criticized by Jeffrey in the _Edinburgh Review_ (No. lvi.,"

3640,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"_Edinburgh Monthly Magazine_ (afterwards _Blackwood's, etc._) (June,"
3641,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"1817, i. 289-295). Jeffrey, as Byron remarked (Letter to Murray, October"
3642,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"12, 1817), was ""very kind,"" and Wilson, whose article ""had all the air"
3643,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"of being a poet's,"" was eloquent in its praises. But there was a fly in"
3644,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"the ointment. ""A suggestion"" had been thrown out, ""in an ingenious paper"
3645,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,in a late number of the _Edinburgh Magazine_ [signed H. M. (John
3646,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"Wilson), July, 1817], that the general conception of this piece, and"
3647,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"much of what is excellent in the manner of its execution, have been"
3648,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"borrowed from the _Tragical History of Dr. Faustus_ of Marlow (_sic_);"""
3649,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,and from this contention Jeffrey dissented. A note to a second paper on
3650,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"Marlowe's _Edward II_. (_Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine_, October, 1817)"
3651,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"offered explanations, and echoed Jeffrey's exaltation of _Manfred_ above"
3652,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,_Dr. Faustus_; but the mischief had been done. Byron was evidently
3653,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"perplexed and distressed, not by the papers in _Blackwood_, which he"
3654,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"never saw, but by Jeffrey's remonstrance in his favour; and in the"
3655,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"letter of October 12 he is at pains to trace the ""evolution"" of"
3656,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"_Manfred_. ""I never read,"" he writes, ""and do not know that I ever saw"

3682,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"granted that Byron knew nothing about the ""Faust-legend,"" or the"
3683,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"""Faust-cycle."" He solemnly denies that he had ever read Marlowe's"

3685,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"(see Medwin's _Conversations, etc._, pp. 208, 209, and a hitherto"
3686,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"unpublished Preface to _Werner_, vol. v.), and it is highly improbable"
3687,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"that he knew anything of Calderon's _El Mágico Prodigioso_, which"
3688,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"Shelley translated in 1822, or of ""the beggarly elements"" of the legend"
3689,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,in Hroswitha's _Lapsus et Conversio Theophrasti Vice-domini_. But
3690,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"Byron's _Manfred_ is ""in the succession"" of scholars who have reached"
3691,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"the limits of natural and legitimate science, and who essay the"
3692,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"supernatural in order to penetrate and comprehend the ""hidden things of"
3693,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"darkness."" A predecessor, if not a progenitor, he must have had, and"
3694,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,there can be no doubt whatever that the primary conception of the
3695,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"character, though by no means the inspiration of the poem, is to be"
3696,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"traced to the ""Monk's"" oral rendering of Goethe's _Faust_, which he gave"
3697,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"in return for his ""bread and salt"" at Diodati. Neither Jeffrey nor"
3698,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"Wilson mentioned _Faust_, but the writer of the notice in the _Critical"
3699,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"Review_ (June, 1817, series v. vol. 5, pp. 622-629) avowed that ""this"
3700,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,scene (the first) is a gross plagiary from a great poet whom Lord Byron
3701,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,has imitated on former occasions without comprehending. Goethe's _Faust_
3702,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"begins in the same way;"" and Goethe himself, in a letter to his friend"
3703,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"Knebel, October, 1817, and again in his review in _Kunst und Alterthum_,"
3704,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"June, 1820, emphasizes whilst he justifies and applauds the use which"
3705,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"Byron had made of his work. ""This singular intellectual poet has taken"
3706,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"my _Faustus_ to himself, and extracted from it the strangest nourishment"
3707,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,for his hypochondriac humour. He has made use of the impelling
3708,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"principles in his own way, for his own purposes, so that no one of them"
3709,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,remains the same; and it is particularly on this account that I cannot
3710,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"enough admire his genius."" Afterwards (see record of a conversation with"
3711,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"Herman Fürst von Pückler, September 14, 1826, _Letters_, v. 511) Goethe"
3712,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"somewhat modified his views, but even then it interested him to trace"
3713,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,the unconscious transformation which Byron had made of his
3714,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"Mephistopheles. It is, perhaps, enough to say that the link between"
3715,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"_Manfred_ and _Faust_ is formal, not spiritual. The problem which Goethe"
3716,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"raised but did not solve, his counterfeit presentment of the eternal"
3717,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"issue between soul and sense, between innocence and renunciation on the"
3718,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"one side, and achievement and satisfaction on the other, was not the"
3719,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,struggle which Byron experienced in himself or desired to depict in his
3720,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"mysterious hierarch of the powers of nature. ""It was the _Staubach_ and"
3721,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"the _Jungfrau_, and something else,"" not the influence of _Faust_ on a"
3722,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"receptive listener, which called up a new theme, and struck out a fresh"
3723,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,well-spring of the imagination. The _motif_ of _Manfred_ is
3724,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,remorse--eternal suffering for inexpiable crime. The sufferer is for
3725,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"ever buoyed up with the hope that there is relief somewhere in nature,"
3726,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"beyond nature, above nature, and experience replies with an everlasting"
3727,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"No! As the sunshine enhances sorrow, so Nature, by the force of"
3728,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"contrast, reveals and enhances guilt. _Manfred_ is no echo of another's"
3729,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"questioning, no expression of a general world-weariness on the part of"
3730,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"the time-spirit, but a personal outcry: ""De profundis clamavi!"""
3731,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,
3732,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"No doubt, apart from this main purport and essence of his song, his"
3733,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,sensitive spirit responded to other and fainter influences. There are
3734,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"""points of resemblance,"" as Jeffrey pointed out and Byron proudly"
3735,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"admitted, between _Manfred_ and the _Prometheus_ of Æschylus. Plainly,"
3736,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"here and there, ""the tone and pitch of the composition,"" and ""the victim"
3737,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"in the more solemn parts,"" are Æschylean. Again, with regard to the"
3738,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"supernatural, there was the stimulus of the conversation of the Shelleys"
3739,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"and of Lewis, brimful of magic and ghost-lore; and lastly, there was the"
3740,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"glamour of _Christabel_, ""the wild and original"" poem which had taken"
3741,INTRODUCTION TO _MANFRED_,"Byron captive, and was often in his thoughts and on his lips. It was no"

3981,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"The Mind--the Spirit--the Promethean spark,[at]"
3982,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"The lightning of my being, is as bright,"
3983,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Pervading, and far darting as your own,"
3984,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"And shall not yield to yours, though cooped in clay!"
3985,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Answer, or I will teach you what I am.[au]"
3986,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
3987,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,_Spirit_. We answer--as we answered; our reply
3988,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Is even in thine own words.
3989,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
3990,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,_Man_.                      Why say ye so?                         160
3991,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
3992,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"_Spirit_. If, as thou say'st, thine essence be as ours,"
3993,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"We have replied in telling thee, the thing"
3994,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Mortals call death hath nought to do with us.
3995,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
3996,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,_Man_. I then have called ye from your realms in vain;
3997,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Ye cannot, or ye will not, aid me."
3998,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
3999,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,_Spirit_.                         Say--[113]
4000,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,What we possess we offer; it is thine:
4001,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Bethink ere thou dismiss us; ask again;
4002,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Kingdom, and sway, and strength, and length of days--"
4003,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
4004,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,_Man_. Accurséd! what have I to do with days?
4005,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,They are too long already.--Hence--begone!                         170
4006,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
4007,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"_Spirit_. Yet pause: being here, our will would do thee service;"

4009,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Which we can make not worthless in thine eyes?
4010,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
4011,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"_Man._ No, none: yet stay--one moment, ere we part,"
4012,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,I would behold ye face to face. I hear
4013,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Your voices, sweet and melancholy sounds,"
4014,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,As Music on the waters;[114] and I see
4015,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,The steady aspect of a clear large Star;
4016,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"But nothing more. Approach me as ye are,"
4017,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Or one--or all--in your accustomed forms.                          180
4018,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
4019,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"_Spirit_. We have no forms, beyond the elements"
4020,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Of which we are the mind and principle:
4021,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,But choose a form--in that we will appear.
4022,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
4023,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,_Man_. I have no choice; there is no form on earth
4024,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Hideous or beautiful to me. Let him,"
4025,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Who is most powerful of ye, take such aspect"
4026,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,As unto him may seem most fitting--Come!

4028,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,_Seventh Spirit (appearing in the shape of a beautiful

4032,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Art not a madness and a mockery,"
4033,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"I yet might be most happy. I will clasp thee,                      190"
4034,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,And we again will be----
4035,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,[_The figure vanishes._
4036,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,My heart is crushed!

4042,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"And the glow-worm in the grass,"
4043,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"And the meteor on the grave,"
4044,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,And the wisp on the morass;[118]
4045,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"When the falling stars are shooting,"
4046,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"And the answered owls are hooting,"
4047,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,And the silent leaves are still
4048,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"In the shadow of the hill,"
4049,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Shall my soul be upon thine,                                   200"
4050,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,With a power and with a sign.
4051,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
4052,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Though thy slumber may be deep,"
4053,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Yet thy Spirit shall not sleep;
4054,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"There are shades which will not vanish,"
4055,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,There are thoughts thou canst not banish;
4056,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"By a Power to thee unknown,"
4057,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Thou canst never be alone;
4058,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Thou art wrapt as with a shroud,"
4059,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Thou art gathered in a cloud;
4060,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,And for ever shalt thou dwell                                  210
4061,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,In the spirit of this spell.
4062,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
4063,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Though thou seest me not pass by,"
4064,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Thou shalt feel me with thine eye
4065,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"As a thing that, though unseen,"
4066,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Must be near thee, and hath been;"
4067,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,And when in that secret dread
4068,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Thou hast turned around thy head,"
4069,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Thou shalt marvel I am not
4070,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"As thy shadow on the spot,"
4071,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,And the power which thou dost feel                             220
4072,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Shall be what thou must conceal.
4073,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
4074,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,And a magic voice and verse
4075,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Hath baptized thee with a curse;
4076,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,And a Spirit of the air
4077,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Hath begirt thee with a snare;
4078,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,In the wind there is a voice
4079,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Shall forbid thee to rejoice;
4080,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,And to thee shall Night deny
4081,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,All the quiet of her sky;
4082,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"And the day shall have a sun,                                  230"
4083,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Which shall make thee wish it done.
4084,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
4085,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,From thy false tears I did distil
4086,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,An essence which hath strength to kill;
4087,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,From thy own heart I then did wring
4088,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,The black blood in its blackest spring;
4089,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"From thy own smile I snatched the snake,"
4090,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,For there it coiled as in a brake;
4091,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,From thy own lip I drew the charm
4092,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Which gave all these their chiefest harm;
4093,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"In proving every poison known,                                 240"
4094,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,I found the strongest was thine own.
4095,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
4096,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"By the cold breast and serpent smile,"
4097,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"By thy unfathomed gulfs of guile,"
4098,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"By that most seeming virtuous eye,"
4099,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,By thy shut soul's hypocrisy;
4100,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,By the perfection of thine art
4101,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Which passed for human thine own heart;
4102,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"By thy delight in others' pain,"
4103,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"And by thy brotherhood of Cain,"
4104,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,I call upon thee! and compel[av]                               250
4105,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Thyself to be thy proper Hell!
4106,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
4107,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,And on thy head I pour the vial
4108,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Which doth devote thee to this trial;
4109,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Nor to slumber, nor to die,"
4110,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Shall be in thy destiny;
4111,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Though thy death shall still seem near
4112,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"To thy wish, but as a fear;"
4113,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Lo! the spell now works around thee,"
4114,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,And the clankless chain hath bound thee;
4115,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,O'er thy heart and brain together                              260
4116,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Hath the word been passed--now wither!

4118,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,SCENE II.--_The Mountain of the Jungfrau_.--
4119,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"_Time, Morning_.--MANFRED _alone upon the cliffs._"
4120,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
4121,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"_Man_. The spirits I have raised abandon me,"
4122,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"The spells which I have studied baffle me,"
4123,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,The remedy I recked of tortured me
4124,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,I lean no more on superhuman aid;
4125,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"It hath no power upon the past, and for"
4126,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"The future, till the past be gulfed in darkness,"
4127,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,It is not of my search.--My Mother Earth![119]
4128,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"And thou fresh-breaking Day, and you, ye Mountains,"
4129,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Why are ye beautiful? I cannot love ye.
4130,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"And thou, the bright Eye of the Universe,                           10"
4131,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"That openest over all, and unto all"
4132,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Art a delight--thou shin'st not on my heart.
4133,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"And you, ye crags, upon whose extreme edge"
4134,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"I stand, and on the torrent's brink beneath"
4135,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Behold the tall pines dwindled as to shrubs
4136,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"In dizziness of distance; when a leap,"
4137,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"A stir, a motion, even a breath, would bring"
4138,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,My breast upon its rocky bosom's bed
4139,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,To rest for ever--wherefore do I pause?
4140,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,I feel the impulse--yet I do not plunge;                            20
4141,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,I see the peril--yet do not recede;
4142,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,And my brain reels--and yet my foot is firm:
4143,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"There is a power upon me which withholds,"
4144,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"And makes it my fatality to live,--"
4145,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,If it be life to wear within myself
4146,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"This barrenness of Spirit, and to be"
4147,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"My own Soul's sepulchre, for I have ceased"
4148,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,To justify my deeds unto myself--
4149,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"The last infirmity of evil. Aye,"
4150,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Thou winged and cloud-cleaving minister,                            30"
4151,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,[_An Eagle passes._
4152,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Whose happy flight is highest into heaven,"
4153,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Well may'st thou swoop so near me--I should be
4154,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Thy prey, and gorge thine eaglets; thou art gone"
4155,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Where the eye cannot follow thee; but thine
4156,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Yet pierces downward, onward, or above,"
4157,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,With a pervading vision.--Beautiful!
4158,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,How beautiful is all this visible world![120]
4159,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,How glorious in its action and itself!
4160,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"But we, who name ourselves its sovereigns, we,"
4161,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Half dust, half deity, alike unfit                                  40"
4162,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"To sink or soar, with our mixed essence make"
4163,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"A conflict of its elements, and breathe"
4164,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"The breath of degradation and of pride,"
4165,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Contending with low wants and lofty will,"
4166,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Till our Mortality predominates,"
4167,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"And men are--what they name not to themselves,"
4168,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"And trust not to each other. Hark! the note,"
4169,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,[_The Shepherd's pipe in the distance is heard._
4170,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,The natural music of the mountain reed--
4171,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,For here the patriarchal days are not
4172,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"A pastoral fable--pipes in the liberal air,                         50"
4173,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Mixed with the sweet bells of the sauntering herd;[121]
4174,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"My soul would drink those echoes. Oh, that I were"
4175,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"The viewless spirit of a lovely sound,"
4176,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"A living voice, a breathing harmony,"
4177,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,A bodiless enjoyment[122]--born and dying
4178,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,With the blest tone which made me!
4179,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
4180,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,_Enter from below a_ CHAMOIS HUNTER.
4181,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
4182,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,_Chamois Hunter_.                 Even so
4183,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,This way the Chamois leapt: her nimble feet
4184,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Have baffled me; my gains to-day will scarce
4185,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Repay my break-neck travail.--What is here?
4186,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Who seems not of my trade, and yet hath reached                     60"
4187,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"A height which none even of our mountaineers,"
4188,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Save our best hunters, may attain: his garb"
4189,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Is goodly, his mien manly, and his air"
4190,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Proud as a free-born peasant's, at this distance:"
4191,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,I will approach him nearer.
4192,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
4193,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,_Man_. (_not perceiving the other_). To be thus--
4194,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Grey-haired with anguish, like these blasted pines,"
4195,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Wrecks of a single winter, barkless, branchless,[123]"
4196,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"A blighted trunk upon a curséd root,"
4197,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Which but supplies a feeling to Decay--
4198,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"And to be thus, eternally but thus,                                 70"
4199,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Having been otherwise! Now furrowed o'er
4200,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"With wrinkles, ploughed by moments, not by years"
4201,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"And hours, all tortured into ages--hours"
4202,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Which I outlive!--Ye toppling crags of ice!
4203,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Ye Avalanches, whom a breath draws down"
4204,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"In mountainous o'erwhelming, come and crush me!"
4205,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"I hear ye momently above, beneath,"
4206,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Crash with a frequent conflict;[124] but ye pass,"
4207,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,And only fall on things that still would live;
4208,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"On the young flourishing forest, or the hut                         80"
4209,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,And hamlet of the harmless villager.
4210,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
4211,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,_C. Hun_. The mists begin to rise from up the valley;
4212,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"I'll warn him to descend, or he may chance"
4213,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,To lose at once his way and life together.
4214,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
4215,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,_Man_. The mists boil up around the glaciers; clouds
4216,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Rise curling fast beneath me, white and sulphury,"
4217,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Like foam from the roused ocean of deep Hell,[aw]"
4218,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Whose every wave breaks on a living shore,"
4219,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Heaped with the damned like pebbles.--I am giddy.[125]
4220,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
4221,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"_C. Hun_. I must approach him cautiously; if near,                  90"

4226,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Leaving a gap in the clouds, and with the shock"
4227,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Rocking their Alpine brethren; filling up
4228,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,The ripe green valleys with Destruction's splinters;
4229,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Damming the rivers with a sudden dash,"
4230,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Which crushed the waters into mist, and made"
4231,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Their fountains find another channel--thus,"
4232,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Thus, in its old age, did Mount Rosenberg--[126]"
4233,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Why stood I not beneath it?

4235,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"_C. Hun_.                  Friend! have a care,                    100"
4236,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Your next step may be fatal!--for the love
4237,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Of Him who made you, stand not on that brink!"
4238,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
4239,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,_Man_. (_not hearing him_).
4240,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Such would have been for me a fitting tomb;
4241,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,My bones had then been quiet in their depth;
4242,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,They had not then been strewn upon the rocks

4244,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"In this one plunge.--Farewell, ye opening Heavens!"
4245,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Look not upon me thus reproachfully--
4246,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,You were not meant for me--Earth! take these atoms!

4248,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"[_As_ MANFRED _is in act to spring from the cliff, the_"

4254,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
4255,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"_Man_. I am most sick at heart--nay, grasp me not--"
4256,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,I am all feebleness--the mountains whirl
4257,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,Spinning around me----I grow blind----What art thou?
4258,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,
4259,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,_C. Hun_. I'll answer that anon.--Away with me----
4260,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,The clouds grow thicker----there--now lean on me--
4261,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Place your foot here--here, take this staff, and cling"
4262,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"A moment to that shrub--now give me your hand,"
4263,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,And hold fast by my girdle--softly--well--                         120
4264,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,The Chalet will be gained within an hour:
4265,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"Come on, we'll quickly find a surer footing,"
4266,SEVENTH SPIRIT.,"And something like a pathway, which the torrent"

4279,ACT II.,MANFRED _and the_ CHAMOIS HUNTER.
4280,ACT II.,
4281,ACT II.,_C. Hun_. No--no--yet pause--thou must not yet go forth;
4282,ACT II.,Thy mind and body are alike unfit
4283,ACT II.,"To trust each other, for some hours, at least;"
4284,ACT II.,"When thou art better, I will be thy guide--"
4285,ACT II.,But whither?
4286,ACT II.,
4287,ACT II.,_Man_.       It imports not: I do know
4288,ACT II.,"My route full well, and need no further guidance."
4289,ACT II.,
4290,ACT II.,_C. Hun_. Thy garb and gait bespeak thee of high lineage--
4291,ACT II.,"One of the many chiefs, whose castled crags"
4292,ACT II.,Look o'er the lower valleys--which of these
4293,ACT II.,May call thee lord? I only know their portals;                      10
4294,ACT II.,My way of life leads me but rarely down
4295,ACT II.,"To bask by the huge hearths of those old halls,"
4296,ACT II.,"Carousing with the vassals; but the paths,"
4297,ACT II.,"Which step from out our mountains to their doors,"
4298,ACT II.,I know from childhood--which of these is thine?
4299,ACT II.,
4300,ACT II.,_Man_. No matter.
4301,ACT II.,
4302,ACT II.,"_C. Hun_.         Well, Sir, pardon me the question,"
4303,ACT II.,"And be of better cheer. Come, taste my wine;"

4308,ACT II.,"_Man_. Away, away! there's blood upon the brim!"
4309,ACT II.,Will it then never--never sink in the earth?
4310,ACT II.,
4311,ACT II.,_C. Hun_. What dost thou mean? thy senses wander from thee.
4312,ACT II.,
4313,ACT II.,_Man_. I say 'tis blood--my blood! the pure warm stream
4314,ACT II.,"Which ran in the veins of my fathers, and in ours"
4315,ACT II.,"When we were in our youth, and had one heart,"
4316,ACT II.,"And loved each other as we should not love,[127]"
4317,ACT II.,"And this was shed: but still it rises up,"
4318,ACT II.,"Colouring the clouds, that shut me out from Heaven,"

4320,ACT II.,
4321,ACT II.,"_C. Hun_. Man of strange words, and some half-maddening sin,[ax]"
4322,ACT II.,"Which makes thee people vacancy, whate'er"
4323,ACT II.,"Thy dread and sufferance be, there's comfort yet--"
4324,ACT II.,"The aid of holy men, and heavenly patience----"
4325,ACT II.,
4326,ACT II.,_Man_. Patience--and patience! Hence--that word was made
4327,ACT II.,"For brutes of burthen, not for birds of prey!"
4328,ACT II.,"Preach it to mortals of a dust like thine,--"
4329,ACT II.,I am not of thine order.
4330,ACT II.,
4331,ACT II.,_C. Hun_.                Thanks to Heaven!
4332,ACT II.,I would not be of thine for the free fame
4333,ACT II.,"Of William Tell; but whatsoe'er thine ill,                          40"
4334,ACT II.,"It must be borne, and these wild starts are useless."
4335,ACT II.,
4336,ACT II.,_Man_. Do I not bear it?--Look on me--I live.
4337,ACT II.,
4338,ACT II.,"_C. Hun._ This is convulsion, and no healthful life."
4339,ACT II.,
4340,ACT II.,"_Man_. I tell thee, man! I have lived many years,"
4341,ACT II.,"Many long years, but they are nothing now"
4342,ACT II.,To those which I must number: ages--ages--
4343,ACT II.,"Space and eternity--and consciousness,"
4344,ACT II.,With the fierce thirst of death--and still unslaked!
4345,ACT II.,
4346,ACT II.,_C. Hun_. Why on thy brow the seal of middle age
4347,ACT II.,Hath scarce been set; I am thine elder far.                         50
4348,ACT II.,
4349,ACT II.,_Man_. Think'st thou existence doth depend on time?[128]
4350,ACT II.,It doth; but actions are our epochs: mine
4351,ACT II.,"Have made my days and nights imperishable,"
4352,ACT II.,"Endless, and all alike, as sands on the shore,"
4353,ACT II.,"Innumerable atoms; and one desert,"
4354,ACT II.,"Barren and cold, on which the wild waves break,"
4355,ACT II.,"But nothing rests, save carcasses and wrecks,"
4356,ACT II.,"Rocks, and the salt-surf weeds of bitterness."
4357,ACT II.,
4358,ACT II.,_C. Hun_. Alas! he's mad--but yet I must not leave him.
4359,ACT II.,
4360,ACT II.,_Man_. I would I were--for then the things I see                    60
4361,ACT II.,Would be but a distempered dream.
4362,ACT II.,
4363,ACT II.,_C. Hun_.                         What is it
4364,ACT II.,"That thou dost see, or think thou look'st upon?"
4365,ACT II.,
4366,ACT II.,"_Man_. Myself, and thee--a peasant of the Alps--"
4367,ACT II.,"Thy humble virtues, hospitable home,"
4368,ACT II.,"And spirit patient, pious, proud, and free;"
4369,ACT II.,"Thy self-respect, grafted on innocent thoughts;"
4370,ACT II.,"Thy days of health, and nights of sleep; thy toils,"
4371,ACT II.,"By danger dignified, yet guiltless; hopes"
4372,ACT II.,"Of cheerful old age and a quiet grave,"
4373,ACT II.,"With cross and garland over its green turf,                         70"
4374,ACT II.,And thy grandchildren's love for epitaph!
4375,ACT II.,This do I see--and then I look within--
4376,ACT II.,It matters not--my Soul was scorched already!
4377,ACT II.,
4378,ACT II.,_C. Hun_. And would'st thou then exchange thy lot for mine?
4379,ACT II.,
4380,ACT II.,"_Man_. No, friend! I would not wrong thee, nor exchange"
4381,ACT II.,My lot with living being: I can bear--
4382,ACT II.,"However wretchedly, 'tis still to bear--"
4383,ACT II.,"In life what others could not brook to dream,"
4384,ACT II.,But perish in their slumber.
4385,ACT II.,
4386,ACT II.,_C. Hun_.                    And with this--
4387,ACT II.,"This cautious feeling for another's pain,                           80"
4388,ACT II.,Canst thou be black with evil?--say not so.
4389,ACT II.,Can one of gentle thoughts have wreaked revenge
4390,ACT II.,Upon his enemies?
4391,ACT II.,
4392,ACT II.,"_Man_.             Oh! no, no, no!"
4393,ACT II.,My injuries came down on those who loved me--
4394,ACT II.,On those whom I best loved: I never quelled
4395,ACT II.,"An enemy, save in my just defence--"
4396,ACT II.,But my embrace was fatal.
4397,ACT II.,
4398,ACT II.,_C. Hun_.                Heaven give thee rest!
4399,ACT II.,And Penitence restore thee to thyself;
4400,ACT II.,My prayers shall be for thee.
4401,ACT II.,
4402,ACT II.,"_Man_.                        I need them not,"
4403,ACT II.,But can endure thy pity. I depart--                                 90
4404,ACT II.,"'Tis time--farewell!--Here's gold, and thanks for thee--"
4405,ACT II.,No words--it is thy due.--Follow me not--
4406,ACT II.,I know my path--the mountain peril's past:
4407,ACT II.,"And once again I charge thee, follow not!"

4415,ACT II.,It is not noon--the Sunbow's rays[129] still arch
4416,ACT II.,"The torrent with the many hues of heaven,"
4417,ACT II.,And roll the sheeted silver's waving column
4418,ACT II.,"O'er the crag's headlong perpendicular,"
4419,ACT II.,"And fling its lines of foaming light along,"
4420,ACT II.,"And to and fro, like the pale courser's tail,"
4421,ACT II.,"The Giant steed, to be bestrode by Death,"
4422,ACT II.,As told in the Apocalypse.[130] No eyes
4423,ACT II.,But mine now drink this sight of loveliness;
4424,ACT II.,"I should be sole in this sweet solitude,                            10"
4425,ACT II.,And with the Spirit of the place divide
4426,ACT II.,The homage of these waters.--I will call her.

4437,ACT II.,"Of purer elements; while the hues of youth,--"
4438,ACT II.,"Carnationed like a sleeping Infant's cheek,"
4439,ACT II.,"Rocked by the beating of her mother's heart,"

4441,ACT II.,"Upon the lofty Glacier's virgin snow,"
4442,ACT II.,"The blush of earth embracing with her Heaven,--"
4443,ACT II.,"Tinge thy celestial aspect, and make tame"
4444,ACT II.,The beauties of the Sunbow which bends o'er thee.
4445,ACT II.,"Beautiful Spirit! in thy calm clear brow,"
4446,ACT II.,"Wherein is glassed serenity of Soul,[ay]"
4447,ACT II.,"Which of itself shows immortality,"
4448,ACT II.,I read that thou wilt pardon to a Son
4449,ACT II.,"Of Earth, whom the abstruser powers permit"
4450,ACT II.,At times to commune with them--if that he                           30
4451,ACT II.,"Avail him of his spells--to call thee thus,"
4452,ACT II.,And gaze on thee a moment.
4453,ACT II.,
4454,ACT II.,_Witch_.                   Son of Earth!
4455,ACT II.,"I know thee, and the Powers which give thee power!"
4456,ACT II.,"I know thee for a man of many thoughts,"
4457,ACT II.,"And deeds of good and ill, extreme in both,"
4458,ACT II.,Fatal and fated in thy sufferings.
4459,ACT II.,I have expected this--what would'st thou with me?
4460,ACT II.,
4461,ACT II.,_Man_. To look upon thy beauty--nothing further.
4462,ACT II.,"The face of the earth hath maddened me, and I"
4463,ACT II.,"Take refuge in her mysteries, and pierce                            40"
4464,ACT II.,To the abodes of those who govern her--
4465,ACT II.,But they can nothing aid me. I have sought
4466,ACT II.,"From them what they could not bestow, and now"
4467,ACT II.,I search no further.
4468,ACT II.,
4469,ACT II.,_Witch_.             What could be the quest
4470,ACT II.,"Which is not in the power of the most powerful,"
4471,ACT II.,The rulers of the invisible?
4472,ACT II.,
4473,ACT II.,_Man_.                       A boon;--
4474,ACT II.,But why should I repeat it? 'twere in vain.
4475,ACT II.,
4476,ACT II.,_Witch_. I know not that; let thy lips utter it.
4477,ACT II.,
4478,ACT II.,"_Man_. Well, though it torture me, 'tis but the same;"
4479,ACT II.,My pang shall find a voice. From my youth upwards                   50
4480,ACT II.,"My Spirit walked not with the souls of men,"
4481,ACT II.,Nor looked upon the earth with human eyes;
4482,ACT II.,"The thirst of their ambition was not mine,"
4483,ACT II.,The aim of their existence was not mine;
4484,ACT II.,"My joys--my griefs--my passions--and my powers,"
4485,ACT II.,"Made me a stranger; though I wore the form,"
4486,ACT II.,"I had no sympathy with breathing flesh,"
4487,ACT II.,Nor midst the Creatures of Clay that girded me
4488,ACT II.,Was there but One who--but of her anon.
4489,ACT II.,"I said with men, and with the thoughts of men,                      60"
4490,ACT II.,"I held but slight communion; but instead,"
4491,ACT II.,"My joy was in the wilderness,--to breathe"
4492,ACT II.,"The difficult air of the iced mountain's top,[131]"
4493,ACT II.,Where the birds dare not build--nor insect's wing
4494,ACT II.,Flit o'er the herbless granite; or to plunge
4495,ACT II.,"Into the torrent, and to roll along"
4496,ACT II.,On the swift whirl of the new-breaking wave
4497,ACT II.,"Of river-stream, or Ocean, in their flow.[132]"
4498,ACT II.,In these my early strength exulted; or
4499,ACT II.,"To follow through the night the moving moon,[133]                   70"
4500,ACT II.,The stars and their development; or catch
4501,ACT II.,The dazzling lightnings till my eyes grew dim;
4502,ACT II.,"Or to look, list'ning, on the scattered leaves,"
4503,ACT II.,While Autumn winds were at their evening song.
4504,ACT II.,"These were my pastimes, and to be alone;"
4505,ACT II.,"For if the beings, of whom I was one,--"
4506,ACT II.,"Hating to be so,--crossed me in my path,"
4507,ACT II.,"I felt myself degraded back to them,"
4508,ACT II.,"And was all clay again. And then I dived,"
4509,ACT II.,"In my lone wanderings, to the caves of Death,                       80"
4510,ACT II.,Searching its cause in its effect; and drew
4511,ACT II.,"From withered bones, and skulls, and heaped up dust"
4512,ACT II.,Conclusions most forbidden.[134] Then I passed--
4513,ACT II.,"The nights of years in sciences untaught,"
4514,ACT II.,"Save in the old-time; and with time and toil,"
4515,ACT II.,"And terrible ordeal, and such penance"
4516,ACT II.,"As in itself hath power upon the air,"
4517,ACT II.,"And spirits that do compass air and earth,"
4518,ACT II.,"Space, and the peopled Infinite, I made"
4519,ACT II.,"Mine eyes familiar with Eternity,                                   90"
4520,ACT II.,"Such as, before me, did the Magi, and"
4521,ACT II.,He who from out their fountain-dwellings raised
4522,ACT II.,"Eros and Anteros,[135] at Gadara,"
4523,ACT II.,As I do thee;--and with my knowledge grew
4524,ACT II.,"The thirst of knowledge, and the power and joy"
4525,ACT II.,"Of this most bright intelligence, until----"
4526,ACT II.,
4527,ACT II.,_Witch_. Proceed.
4528,ACT II.,
4529,ACT II.,"_Man_.            Oh! I but thus prolonged my words,"
4530,ACT II.,"Boasting these idle attributes, because"
4531,ACT II.,As I approach the core of my heart's grief--
4532,ACT II.,But--to my task. I have not named to thee                          100
4533,ACT II.,"Father or mother, mistress, friend, or being,"
4534,ACT II.,With whom I wore the chain of human ties;
4535,ACT II.,"If I had such, they seemed not such to me--"
4536,ACT II.,Yet there was One----
4537,ACT II.,
4538,ACT II.,_Witch_.                Spare not thyself--proceed.
4539,ACT II.,
4540,ACT II.,_Man_. She was like me in lineaments--her eyes--
4541,ACT II.,"Her hair--her features--all, to the very tone"
4542,ACT II.,"Even of her voice, they said were like to mine;"
4543,ACT II.,"But softened all, and tempered into beauty:"
4544,ACT II.,"She had the same lone thoughts and wanderings,"
4545,ACT II.,"The quest of hidden knowledge, and a mind                          110"
4546,ACT II.,To comprehend the Universe: nor these
4547,ACT II.,"Alone, but with them gentler powers than mine,"
4548,ACT II.,"Pity, and smiles, and tears--which I had not;"
4549,ACT II.,And tenderness--but that I had for her;
4550,ACT II.,Humility--and that I never had.
4551,ACT II.,Her faults were mine--her virtues were her own--
4552,ACT II.,"I loved her, and destroyed her!"
4553,ACT II.,
4554,ACT II.,_Witch_.                          With thy hand?
4555,ACT II.,
4556,ACT II.,"_Man_. Not with my hand, but heart, which broke her heart;"
4557,ACT II.,"It gazed on mine, and withered. I have shed"
4558,ACT II.,"Blood, but not hers--and yet her blood was shed;                   120"
4559,ACT II.,I saw--and could not stanch it.
4560,ACT II.,
4561,ACT II.,_Witch_.                         And for this--
4562,ACT II.,A being of the race thou dost despise--
4563,ACT II.,"The order, which thine own would rise above,"
4564,ACT II.,"Mingling with us and ours,--thou dost forego"
4565,ACT II.,"The gifts of our great knowledge, and shrink'st back"
4566,ACT II.,To recreant mortality----Away!
4567,ACT II.,
4568,ACT II.,"_Man_. Daughter of Air! I tell thee, since that hour--"
4569,ACT II.,"But words are breath--look on me in my sleep,"
4570,ACT II.,Or watch my watchings--Come and sit by me!
4571,ACT II.,"My solitude is solitude no more,                                   130"
4572,ACT II.,But peopled with the Furies;--I have gnashed
4573,ACT II.,"My teeth in darkness till returning morn,"
4574,ACT II.,Then cursed myself till sunset;--I have prayed
4575,ACT II.,For madness as a blessing--'tis denied me.
4576,ACT II.,I have affronted Death--but in the war
4577,ACT II.,"Of elements the waters shrunk from me,[136]"
4578,ACT II.,And fatal things passed harmless; the cold hand
4579,ACT II.,"Of an all-pitiless Demon held me back,"
4580,ACT II.,"Back by a single hair, which would not break."
4581,ACT II.,"In Fantasy, Imagination, all                                       140"
4582,ACT II.,The affluence of my soul--which one day was
4583,ACT II.,"A Croesus in creation--I plunged deep,"
4584,ACT II.,"But, like an ebbing wave, it dashed me back"
4585,ACT II.,Into the gulf of my unfathomed thought.
4586,ACT II.,I plunged amidst Mankind--Forgetfulness[137]
4587,ACT II.,"I sought in all, save where 'tis to be found--"
4588,ACT II.,"And that I have to learn--my Sciences,"
4589,ACT II.,"My long pursued and superhuman art,"
4590,ACT II.,Is mortal here: I dwell in my despair--
4591,ACT II.,And live--and live for ever.[az]

4594,ACT II.,That I can aid thee.
4595,ACT II.,
4596,ACT II.,_Man_.               To do this thy power
4597,ACT II.,"Must wake the dead, or lay me low with them."
4598,ACT II.,Do so--in any shape--in any hour--
4599,ACT II.,With any torture--so it be the last.

4601,ACT II.,_Witch_. That is not in my province; but if thou
4602,ACT II.,"Wilt swear obedience to my will, and do"

4675,ACT II.,"The aspect of a tumbling tempest's foam,"
4676,ACT II.,Frozen in a moment[140]--a dead Whirlpool's image:

4850,ACT II.,Prince of the Powers invisible! This man
4851,ACT II.,"Is of no common order, as his port"

4854,ACT II.,"Our own; his knowledge, and his powers and will,"
4855,ACT II.,"As far as is compatible with clay,"
4856,ACT II.,"Which clogs the ethereal essence, have been such"

4859,ACT II.,And they have only taught him what we know--                        60
4860,ACT II.,"That knowledge is not happiness, and science[146]"
4861,ACT II.,But an exchange of ignorance for that

4922,NEMESIS.,"It is the same! Oh, God! that I should dread"
4923,NEMESIS.,"To look upon the same--Astarte!--No,"
4924,NEMESIS.,I cannot speak to her--but bid her speak--

4934,NEMESIS.,"_Man_.                      She is silent,"

4952,NEMESIS.,"Too much, as I loved thee: we were not made"

4959,NEMESIS.,To bind me in existence--in a life

4961,NEMESIS.,A future like the past. I cannot rest.                             130
4962,NEMESIS.,"I know not what I ask, nor what I seek:"

4972,NEMESIS.,"Yet speak to me! I have outwatched the stars,"
4973,NEMESIS.,And gazed o'er heaven in vain in search of thee.

5052,ACT III.,
5053,ACT III.,_Man_. (_alone_).     There is a calm upon me--
5054,ACT III.,Inexplicable stillness! which till now
5055,ACT III.,Did not belong to what I knew of life.
5056,ACT III.,If that I did not know Philosophy
5057,ACT III.,"To be of all our vanities the motliest,                             10"
5058,ACT III.,The merest word that ever fooled the ear
5059,ACT III.,"From out the schoolman's jargon, I should deem"
5060,ACT III.,"The golden secret, the sought ""Kalon,"" found,[152]"
5061,ACT III.,"And seated in my soul. It will not last,"
5062,ACT III.,"But it is well to have known it, though but once:"
5063,ACT III.,"It hath enlarged my thoughts with a new sense,"
5064,ACT III.,And I within my tablets would note down
5065,ACT III.,That there is such a feeling. Who is there?
5066,ACT III.,
5067,ACT III.,_Re-enter_ HERMAN.
5068,ACT III.,
5069,ACT III.,"_Her_. My Lord, the Abbot of St. Maurice craves[153]"
5070,ACT III.,To greet your presence.
5071,ACT III.,
5072,ACT III.,_Enter the_ ABBOT OF ST. MAURICE.
5073,ACT III.,
5074,ACT III.,_Abbot_.                 Peace be with Count Manfred!              20
5075,ACT III.,
5076,ACT III.,"_Man_. Thanks, holy father! welcome to these walls;"
5077,ACT III.,"Thy presence honours them, and blesseth those"
5078,ACT III.,Who dwell within them.
5079,ACT III.,
5080,ACT III.,"_Abbot_.              Would it were so, Count!--"
5081,ACT III.,But I would fain confer with thee alone.
5082,ACT III.,
5083,ACT III.,"_Man_. Herman, retire.--What would my reverend guest?"
5084,ACT III.,
5085,ACT III.,"_Abbot_. Thus, without prelude:--Age and zeal--my office--"
5086,ACT III.,And good intent must plead my privilege;
5087,ACT III.,"Our near, though not acquainted neighbourhood,"
5088,ACT III.,"May also be my herald. Rumours strange,"
5089,ACT III.,"And of unholy nature, are abroad,                                   30"
5090,ACT III.,And busy with thy name--a noble name
5091,ACT III.,For centuries: may he who bears it now
5092,ACT III.,Transmit it unimpaired!
5093,ACT III.,
5094,ACT III.,"_Man_.                  Proceed,--I listen."
5095,ACT III.,
5096,ACT III.,_Abbot_. 'Tis said thou holdest converse with the things
5097,ACT III.,Which are forbidden to the search of man;
5098,ACT III.,"That with the dwellers of the dark abodes,"
5099,ACT III.,The many evil and unheavenly spirits
5100,ACT III.,"Which walk the valley of the Shade of Death,"
5101,ACT III.,"Thou communest. I know that with mankind,"
5102,ACT III.,"Thy fellows in creation, thou dost rarely                           40"
5103,ACT III.,"Exchange thy thoughts, and that thy solitude"
5104,ACT III.,Is as an Anchorite's--were it but holy.
5105,ACT III.,
5106,ACT III.,_Man_. And what are they who do avouch these things?
5107,ACT III.,
5108,ACT III.,_Abbot_. My pious brethren--the scaréd peasantry--
5109,ACT III.,Even thy own vassals--who do look on thee
5110,ACT III.,With most unquiet eyes. Thy life's in peril!
5111,ACT III.,
5112,ACT III.,_Man_. Take it.
5113,ACT III.,
5114,ACT III.,"_Abbot_.        I come to save, and not destroy:"
5115,ACT III.,I would not pry into thy secret soul;
5116,ACT III.,"But if these things be sooth, there still is time"
5117,ACT III.,For penitence and pity: reconcile thee                              50
5118,ACT III.,"With the true church, and through the church to Heaven."
5119,ACT III.,
5120,ACT III.,_Man_. I hear thee. This is my reply--whate'er
5121,ACT III.,"I may have been, or am, doth rest between"
5122,ACT III.,Heaven and myself--I shall not choose a mortal
5123,ACT III.,To be my mediator--Have I sinned
5124,ACT III.,Against your ordinances? prove and punish![154]
5125,ACT III.,
5126,ACT III.,"_Abbot_. My son! I did not speak of punishment,[155]"
5127,ACT III.,But penitence and pardon;--with thyself
5128,ACT III.,"The choice of such remains--and for the last,"
5129,ACT III.,Our institutions and our strong belief                              60
5130,ACT III.,Have given me power to smooth the path from sin
5131,ACT III.,To higher hope and better thoughts; the first
5132,ACT III.,"I leave to Heaven,--""Vengeance is mine alone!"""
5133,ACT III.,"So saith the Lord, and with all humbleness"
5134,ACT III.,His servant echoes back the awful word.
5135,ACT III.,
5136,ACT III.,"_Man_. Old man! there is no power in holy men,"
5137,ACT III.,"Nor charm in prayer, nor purifying form"
5138,ACT III.,"Of penitence, nor outward look, nor fast,"
5139,ACT III.,"Nor agony--nor, greater than all these,"
5140,ACT III.,"The innate tortures of that deep Despair,                           70"
5141,ACT III.,"Which is Remorse without the fear of Hell,"
5142,ACT III.,But all in all sufficient to itself
5143,ACT III.,Would make a hell of Heaven--can exorcise
5144,ACT III.,From out the unbounded spirit the quick sense
5145,ACT III.,Of its own sins--wrongs--sufferance--and revenge
5146,ACT III.,Upon itself; there is no future pang
5147,ACT III.,Can deal that justice on the self--condemned
5148,ACT III.,He deals on his own soul.
5149,ACT III.,
5150,ACT III.,_Abbot_.                 All this is well;
5151,ACT III.,"For this will pass away, and be succeeded"
5152,ACT III.,"By an auspicious hope, which shall look up                          80"
5153,ACT III.,"With calm assurafice to that blessed place,"
5154,ACT III.,"Which all who seek may win, whatever be"
5155,ACT III.,"Their earthly errors, so they be atoned:"
5156,ACT III.,And the commencement of atonement is
5157,ACT III.,The sense of its necessity. Say on--
5158,ACT III.,And all our church can teach thee shall be taught;
5159,ACT III.,And all we can absolve thee shall be pardoned.

5172,ACT III.,
5173,ACT III.,_Man_.                     I answer with the Roman--

5182,ACT III.,
5183,ACT III.,"_Man_. Aye--father! I have had those early visions,"
5184,ACT III.,"And noble aspirations in my youth,"
5185,ACT III.,"To make my own the mind of other men,"
5186,ACT III.,The enlightener of nations; and to rise
5187,ACT III.,I knew not whither--it might be to fall;
5188,ACT III.,"But fall, even as the mountain-cataract,"
5189,ACT III.,"Which having leapt from its more dazzling height,                  110"

5192,ACT III.,"Clouds raining from the re-ascended skies,)[157]"
5193,ACT III.,"Lies low but mighty still.--But this is past,"
5194,ACT III.,My thoughts mistook themselves.
5195,ACT III.,
5196,ACT III.,_Abbot_.                         And wherefore so?
5197,ACT III.,
5198,ACT III.,_Man_.I could not tame my nature down; for he
5199,ACT III.,"Must serve who fain would sway; and soothe, and sue,"
5200,ACT III.,"And watch all time, and pry into all place,"
5201,ACT III.,"And be a living Lie, who would become"
5202,ACT III.,A mighty thing amongst the mean--and such                          120
5203,ACT III.,The mass are; I disdained to mingle with
5204,ACT III.,"A herd, though to be leader--and of wolves,"
5205,ACT III.,"The lion is alone, and so am I."
5206,ACT III.,
5207,ACT III.,_Abbot_. And why not live and act with other men?
5208,ACT III.,
5209,ACT III.,_Man_. Because my nature was averse from life;
5210,ACT III.,"And yet not cruel; for I would not make,"
5211,ACT III.,"But find a desolation. Like the Wind,"
5212,ACT III.,"The red-hot breath of the most lone Simoom,[158]"
5213,ACT III.,"Which dwells but in the desert, and sweeps o'er"
5214,ACT III.,"The barren sands which bear no shrubs to blast,                    130"
5215,ACT III.,"And revels o'er their wild and arid waves,"
5216,ACT III.,"And seeketh not, so that it is not sought,"
5217,ACT III.,"But being met is deadly,--such hath been"
5218,ACT III.,The course of my existence; but there came
5219,ACT III.,Things in my path which are no more.
5220,ACT III.,
5221,ACT III.,_Abbot_.                             Alas!
5222,ACT III.,I 'gin to fear that thou art past all aid
5223,ACT III.,"From me and from my calling; yet so young,"
5224,ACT III.,I still would----
5225,ACT III.,
5226,ACT III.,_Man_.              Look on me! there is an order
5227,ACT III.,"Of mortals on the earth, who do become"
5228,ACT III.,"Old in their youth, and die ere middle age,[159]                   140"
5229,ACT III.,Without the violence of warlike death;
5230,ACT III.,Some perishing of pleasure--some of study--
5231,ACT III.,"Some worn with toil, some of mere weariness,--"
5232,ACT III.,Some of disease--and some insanity--
5233,ACT III.,"And some of withered, or of broken hearts;"
5234,ACT III.,For this last is a malady which slays
5235,ACT III.,"More than are numbered in the lists of Fate,"
5236,ACT III.,"Taking all shapes, and bearing many names."
5237,ACT III.,Look upon me! for even of all these things
5238,ACT III.,"Have I partaken; and of all these things,                          150"
5239,ACT III.,One were enough; then wonder not that I

5243,ACT III.,"_Abbot_. Yet, hear me still--"

5245,ACT III.,_Man_.                        Old man! I do respect
5246,ACT III.,"Thine order, and revere thine years; I deem"
5247,ACT III.,"Thy purpose pious, but it is in vain:"
5248,ACT III.,"Think me not churlish; I would spare thyself,"

6901,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,
6902,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,
6903,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"_BEPPO_ was written in the autumn (September 6--October 12, _Letters_,"
6904,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"1900, iv. 172) of 1817, whilst Byron was still engaged on the additional"
6905,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"stanzas of the Fourth Canto of _Childe Harold_. His new poem, as he"
6906,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"admitted from the first, was ""after the excellent manner"" of John"
6907,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"Hookham Frere's _jeu d'esprit_, known as _Whistlecraft_ (_Prospectus and"
6908,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,Specimen of an intended National Work_ by William and Robert
6909,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"Whistlecraft, London, 1818[192]), which must have reached him in the"
6910,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"summer of 1817. Whether he divined the identity of ""Whistlecraft"" from"
6911,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"the first, or whether his guess was an after-thought, he did not"
6912,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,hesitate to take the water and shoot ahead of his unsuspecting rival. It
6913,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"was a case of plagiarism _in excelsis_, and the superiority of the"
6914,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,imitation to the original must be set down to the genius of the
6915,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"plagiary, unaided by any profound study of Italian literature, or an"
6916,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,acquaintance at first hand with the parents and inspirers of
6917,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,_Whistlecraft_.
6918,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,
6919,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,It is possible that he had read and forgotten some specimens of Pulci's
6920,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"_Morgante Maggiore_, which J. H. Merivale had printed in the _Monthly"
6921,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"Magazine_ for 1806-1807, vol. xxi. pp. 304, 510, etc., and it is certain"
6922,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"that he was familiar with his _Orlando in Roncesvalles_, published in"
6923,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,1814. He distinctly states that he had not seen W. S. Rose's[193]
6924,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"translation of Casti's _Animali Parlanti_ (first edition [anonymous],"
6925,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"1816), but, according to Pryse Gordon (_Personal Memoirs_, ii. 328), he"
6926,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"had read the original. If we may trust Ugo Foscolo (see ""Narrative and"
6927,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"Romantic Poems of the Italians"" in the _Quart. Rev_., April, 1819, vol."
6928,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"xxi. pp. 486-526), there is some evidence that Byron had read"
6929,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,Forteguerri's _Ricciardetto_ (translated in 1819 by Sylvester (Douglas)
6930,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"Lord Glenbervie, and again, by John Herman Merivale, under the title of"
6931,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"_The Two First Cantos of Richardetto_, 1820), but the parallel which he"
6932,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"adduces (_vide post_, p. 166) is not very striking or convincing."
6933,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,
6934,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"On the other hand, after the poem was completed (March 25, 1818), he was"
6935,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"under the impression that ""Berni was the original of _all_ ... the"
6936,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"father of that kind [i.e. the mock-heroic] of writing;"" but there is"
6937,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,nothing to show whether he had or had not read the _rifacimento_ of
6938,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"Orlando's _Innamorato_, or the more distinctively Bernesque _Capitoli_."
6939,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"Two years later (see Letter to Murray, February 21, 1820, _Letters_,"
6940,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"1900, iv. 407; and ""Advertisement"" to _Morgante Maggiore_) he had"
6941,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"discovered that ""Pulci was the parent of _Whistlecraft_, and the"
6942,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"precursor and model of Berni,"" but, in 1817, he was only at the"
6943,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"commencement of his studies. A time came long before the ""year or two"""
6944,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"of his promise (March 25, 1818) when he had learned to simulate the"
6945,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"_vera imago_ of the Italian Muse, and was able not only to surpass his"
6946,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"""immediate model,"" but to rival his model's forerunners and inspirers."
6947,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"In the meanwhile a tale based on a ""Venetian anecdote"" (perhaps an"
6948,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"""episode"" in the history of Colonel Fitzgerald and the Marchesa"

6950,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"iv. 26) lent itself to ""the excellent manner of Mr. Whistlecraft,"" and"
6951,INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_,"would show ""the knowing ones,"" that is, Murray's advisers, Gifford,"

8790,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"_Mazeppa_, a legend of the Russian Ukraine, or frontier region, is based"
8791,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,on the passage in Voltaire's _Charles XII_. prefixed as the
8792,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"""Advertisement"" to the poem. Voltaire seems to have known very little"
8793,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"about the man or his history, and Byron, though he draws largely on his"
8794,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"imagination, was content to take his substratum of fact from Voltaire."
8795,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"The ""true story of Mazeppa"" is worth re-telling for its own sake, and"
8796,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,lends a fresh interest and vitality to the legend. Ivan Stepanovitch
8797,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"Mazeppa (or Mazepa), born about the year 1645, was of Cossack origin,"
8798,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"but appears to have belonged, by descent or creation, to the lesser"
8799,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,nobility of the semi-Polish Volhynia. He began life (1660) as a page of
8800,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"honour in the Court of King John Casimir V. of Poland, where he studied"
8801,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"Latin, and acquired the tongue and pen of eloquent statesmanship."
8802,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"Banished from the court on account of a quarrel, he withdrew to his"
8803,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"mother's estate in Volhynia, and there, to beguile the time, made love"
8804,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"to the wife of a neighbouring magnate, the _pane_ or Lord Falbowski. The"
8805,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"intrigue was discovered, and to avenge his wrongs the outraged husband"
8806,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"caused Mazeppa to be stripped to the skin, and bound to his own steed."
8807,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"The horse, lashed into madness, and terror-stricken by the discharge of"
8808,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"a pistol, started off at a gallop, and rushing ""thorough bush, thorough"

8812,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"With regard to the sequel or issue of this episode, history is silent,"
8813,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,but when the curtain rises again (A.D. 1674) Mazeppa is discovered in
8814,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,the character of writer-general or foreign secretary to Peter
8815,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"Doroshénko, hetman or president of the Western Ukraine, on the hither"
8816,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"side of the Dniéper. From the service of Doroshénko, who came to an"
8817,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"untimely end, he passed by a series of accidents into the employ of his"
8818,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"rival, Samoïlovitch, hetman of the Eastern Ukraine, and, as his"
8819,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"secretary or envoy, continued to attract the notice and to conciliate"
8820,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"the good will of the (regent) Tzarina Sophia and her eminent _boyard_,"
8821,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,Prince Basil Golitsyn. A time came (1687) when it served the interests
8822,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"of Russia to degrade Samoïlovitch, and raise Mazeppa to the post of"
8823,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"hetman, and thenceforward, for twenty years and more, he held something"
8824,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"like a regal sway over the whole of the Ukraine (a fertile ""no-man's"
8825,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"land,"" watered by the Dniéper and its tributaries), openly the loyal and"
8826,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"zealous ally of his neighbour and suzerain, Peter the Great."

8830,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"Muscovite suzerainty would in any case have urged him to revolt, must"
8831,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"remain doubtful, but it is certain that the immediate cause of a final"
8832,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,reversal of the allegiance and a break with the Tsar was a second and
8833,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,still more fateful _affaire du coeur_. The hetman was upwards of sixty
8834,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"years of age, but, even so, he fell in love with his god-daughter,"
8835,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"Matréna, who, in spite of difference of age and ecclesiastical kinship,"
8836,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"not only returned his love, but, to escape the upbraidings and"
8837,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"persecution of her mother, took refuge under his roof. Mazeppa sent the"
8838,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"girl back to her home, but, as his love-letters testify, continued to"
8839,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"woo her with the tenderest and most passionate solicitings; and,"
8840,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,although she finally yielded to _force majeure_ and married another
8841,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"suitor, her parents nursed their revenge, and endeavoured to embroil the"
8842,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"hetman with the Tsar. For a time their machinations failed, and"
8843,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"Matréna's father, Kotchúbey, together with his friend Iskra, were"
8844,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"executed with the Tsar's assent and approbation. Before long, however,"
8845,INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_,"Mazeppa, who had been for some time past in secret correspondence with"

9018,IV.,Felt if his arms in order good                                      80
9019,IV.,The long day's march had well withstood--
9020,IV.,"If still the powder filled the pan,"
9021,IV.,And flints unloosened kept their lock--
9022,IV.,"His sabre's hilt and scabbard felt,"
9023,IV.,And whether they had chafed his belt;
9024,IV.,"And next the venerable man,"
9025,IV.,"From out his havresack and can,"
9026,IV.,Prepared and spread his slender stock;
9027,IV.,And to the Monarch and his men
9028,IV.,The whole or portion offered then                                   90
9029,IV.,With far less of inquietude
9030,IV.,Than courtiers at a banquet would.
9031,IV.,And Charles of this his slender share
9032,IV.,"With smiles partook a moment there,"
9033,IV.,"To force of cheer a greater show,"
9034,IV.,And seem above both wounds and woe;--
9035,IV.,"And then he said--""Of all our band,"
9036,IV.,"Though firm of heart and strong of hand,"
9037,IV.,"In skirmish, march, or forage, none"
9038,IV.,Can less have said or more have done                               100
9039,IV.,"Than thee, Mazeppa! On the earth"
9040,IV.,"So fit a pair had never birth,"
9041,IV.,"Since Alexander's days till now,"
9042,IV.,As thy Bucephalus and thou:
9043,IV.,All Scythia's fame to thine should yield
9044,IV.,"For pricking on o'er flood and field."""
9045,IV.,"Mazeppa answered--""Ill betide"
9046,IV.,"The school wherein I learned to ride!"""
9047,IV.,"Quoth Charles--""Old Hetman, wherefore so,"
9048,IV.,"Since thou hast learned the art so well?""                          110"
9049,IV.,"Mazeppa said--""'Twere long to tell;"
9050,IV.,"And we have many a league to go,"
9051,IV.,"With every now and then a blow,"
9052,IV.,"And ten to one at least the foe,"
9053,IV.,"Before our steeds may graze at ease,"
9054,IV.,Beyond the swift Borysthenes:[253]
9055,IV.,"And, Sire, your limbs have need of rest,"
9056,IV.,And I will be the sentinel
9057,IV.,"Of this your troop.""--""But I request,"""
9058,IV.,"Said Sweden's monarch, ""thou wilt tell                             120"
9059,IV.,"This tale of thine, and I may reap,"
9060,IV.,"Perchance, from this the boon of sleep;"
9061,IV.,For at this moment from my eyes
9062,IV.,"The hope of present slumber flies."""
9063,IV.,
9064,IV.,"""Well, Sire, with such a hope, I'll track"
9065,IV.,My seventy years of memory back:
9066,IV.,"I think 'twas in my twentieth spring,--"
9067,IV.,"Aye 'twas,--when Casimir was king[254]--"
9068,IV.,"John Casimir,--I was his page"
9069,IV.,"Six summers, in my earlier age:[255]                               130"
9070,IV.,"A learnéd monarch, faith! was he,"
9071,IV.,And most unlike your Majesty;
9072,IV.,"He made no wars, and did not gain"
9073,IV.,New realms to lose them back again;
9074,IV.,And (save debates in Warsaw's diet)
9075,IV.,He reigned in most unseemly quiet;
9076,IV.,Not that he had no cares to vex;
9077,IV.,He loved the Muses and the Sex;[256]
9078,IV.,"And sometimes these so froward are,"
9079,IV.,They made him wish himself at war;                                 140
9080,IV.,"But soon his wrath being o'er, he took"
9081,IV.,Another mistress--or new book:
9082,IV.,And then he gave prodigious fetes--
9083,IV.,All Warsaw gathered round his gates
9084,IV.,"To gaze upon his splendid court,"
9085,IV.,"And dames, and chiefs, of princely port."
9086,IV.,"He was the Polish Solomon,"
9087,IV.,"So sung his poets, all but one,"
9088,IV.,"Who, being unpensioned, made a satire,"
9089,IV.,And boasted that he could not flatter.                             150
9090,IV.,"It was a court of jousts and mimes,"
9091,IV.,Where every courtier tried at rhymes;
9092,IV.,"Even I for once produced some verses,"
9093,IV.,And signed my odes 'Despairing Thyrsis.'
9094,IV.,"There was a certain Palatine,[257]"
9095,IV.,"A Count of far and high descent,"
9096,IV.,Rich as a salt or silver mine;[258]
9097,IV.,"And he was proud, ye may divine,"
9098,IV.,As if from Heaven he had been sent;
9099,IV.,He had such wealth in blood and ore                                160
9100,IV.,As few could match beneath the throne;
9101,IV.,"And he would gaze upon his store,"
9102,IV.,"And o'er his pedigree would pore,"
9103,IV.,"Until by some confusion led,"
9104,IV.,"Which almost looked like want of head,"
9105,IV.,He thought their merits were his own.
9106,IV.,His wife was not of this opinion;
9107,IV.,"His junior she by thirty years,"
9108,IV.,Grew daily tired of his dominion;
9109,IV.,"And, after wishes, hopes, and fears,                             170"
9110,IV.,"To Virtue a few farewell tears,"
9111,IV.,A restless dream or two--some glances
9112,IV.,"At Warsaw's youth--some songs, and dances,"
9113,IV.,"Awaited but the usual chances,"
9114,IV.,Those happy accidents which render
9115,IV.,"The coldest dames so very tender,"
9116,IV.,"To deck her Count with titles given,"
9117,IV.,"'Tis said, as passports into Heaven;"
9118,IV.,"But, strange to say, they rarely boast"
9119,IV.,"Of these, who have deserved them most.                             180"
9120,IV.,
9121,V.,V.
9122,V.,
9123,V.,"""I was a goodly stripling then;"
9124,V.,"At seventy years I so may say,"
9125,V.,"That there were few, or boys or men,"
9126,V.,"Who, in my dawning time of day,"
9127,V.,"Of vassal or of knight's degree,"
9128,V.,Could vie in vanities with me;
9129,V.,"For I had strength--youth--gaiety,"
9130,V.,"A port, not like to this ye see,"
9131,V.,"But smooth, as all is rugged now;"
9132,V.,"For Time, and Care, and War, have ploughed                       190"
9133,V.,My very soul from out my brow;
9134,V.,And thus I should be disavowed
9135,V.,"By all my kind and kin, could they"
9136,V.,Compare my day and yesterday;
9137,V.,"This change was wrought, too, long ere age"
9138,V.,Had ta'en my features for his page:
9139,V.,"With years, ye know, have not declined"
9140,V.,"My strength--my courage--or my mind,"
9141,V.,Or at this hour I should not be
9142,V.,"Telling old tales beneath a tree,                                  200"
9143,V.,With starless skies my canopy.
9144,V.,But let me on: Theresa's[259] form--
9145,V.,"Methinks it glides before me now,"
9146,V.,"Between me and yon chestnut's bough,"
9147,V.,The memory is so quick and warm;
9148,V.,And yet I find no words to tell
9149,V.,The shape of her I loved so well:
9150,V.,"She had the Asiatic eye,"
9151,V.,Such as our Turkish neighbourhood
9152,V.,"Hath mingled with our Polish blood,                              210"
9153,V.,Dark as above us is the sky;
9154,V.,"But through it stole a tender light,"
9155,V.,Like the first moonrise of midnight;
9156,V.,"Large, dark, and swimming in the stream,"
9157,V.,Which seemed to melt to its own beam;
9158,V.,"All love, half languor, and half fire,"
9159,V.,"Like saints that at the stake expire,"
9160,V.,"And lift their raptured looks on high,"
9161,V.,As though it were a joy to die.[bs]
9162,V.,"A brow like a midsummer lake,                                      220"
9163,V.,"Transparent with the sun therein,"
9164,V.,"When waves no murmur dare to make,"
9165,V.,And heaven beholds her face within.
9166,V.,A cheek and lip--but why proceed?
9167,V.,"I loved her then, I love her still;"
9168,V.,"And such as I am, love indeed"
9169,V.,In fierce extremes--in good and ill.
9170,V.,"But still we love even in our rage,"
9171,V.,And haunted to our very age
9172,V.,"With the vain shadow of the past,--                                230"
9173,V.,As is Mazeppa to the last.
9174,V.,
9175,VI.,VI.
9176,VI.,
9177,VI.,"""We met--we gazed--I saw, and sighed;"
9178,VI.,"She did not speak, and yet replied;"
9179,VI.,There are ten thousand tones and signs
9180,VI.,"We hear and see, but none defines--"
9181,VI.,"Involuntary sparks of thought,"
9182,VI.,"Which strike from out the heart o'erwrought,"
9183,VI.,"And form a strange intelligence,"
9184,VI.,"Alike mysterious and intense,"
9185,VI.,"Which link the burning chain that binds,                           240"
9186,VI.,"Without their will, young hearts and minds;"
9187,VI.,"Conveying, as the electric[260] wire,"
9188,VI.,"We know not how, the absorbing fire."
9189,VI.,"I saw, and sighed--in silence wept,"
9190,VI.,"And still reluctant distance kept,"
9191,VI.,"Until I was made known to her,"
9192,VI.,And we might then and there confer
9193,VI.,"Without suspicion--then, even then,"
9194,VI.,"I longed, and was resolved to speak;"
9195,VI.,"But on my lips they died again,                                    250"
9196,VI.,"The accents tremulous and weak,"
9197,VI.,"Until one hour.--There is a game,"
9198,VI.,"A frivolous and foolish play,"
9199,VI.,Wherewith we while away the day;
9200,VI.,It is--I have forgot the name--
9201,VI.,"And we to this, it seems, were set,"
9202,VI.,"By some strange chance, which I forget:"
9203,VI.,"I recked not if I won or lost,"
9204,VI.,It was enough for me to be
9205,VI.,"So near to hear, and oh! to see                                  260"
9206,VI.,The being whom I loved the most.
9207,VI.,"I watched her as a sentinel,"
9208,VI.,(May ours this dark night watch as well!)
9209,VI.,"Until I saw, and thus it was,"
9210,VI.,"That she was pensive, nor perceived"
9211,VI.,"Her occupation, nor was grieved"
9212,VI.,Nor glad to lose or gain; but still
9213,VI.,"Played on for hours, as if her will"
9214,VI.,"Yet bound her to the place, though not"
9215,VI.,That hers might be the winning lot[bt].                            270
9216,VI.,"Then through my brain the thought did pass,"
9217,VI.,"Even as a flash of lightning there,"
9218,VI.,That there was something in her air
9219,VI.,Which would not doom me to despair;
9220,VI.,"And on the thought my words broke forth,"
9221,VI.,All incoherent as they were;
9222,VI.,"Their eloquence was little worth,"
9223,VI.,But yet she listened--'tis enough--
9224,VI.,Who listens once will listen twice;
9225,VI.,"Her heart, be sure, is not of ice--                              280"
9226,VI.,And one refusal no rebuff.
9227,VI.,
9228,VII.,VII.
9229,VII.,
9230,VII.,"""I loved, and was beloved again--"
9231,VII.,"They tell me, Sire, you never knew"
9232,VII.,"Those gentle frailties; if 'tis true,"
9233,VII.,I shorten all my joy or pain;
9234,VII.,To you 'twould seem absurd as vain;
9235,VII.,"But all men are not born to reign,"
9236,VII.,"Or o'er their passions, or as you"
9237,VII.,Thus o'er themselves and nations too.
9238,VII.,"I am--or rather _was_--a Prince,                                   290"
9239,VII.,"A chief of thousands, and could lead"
9240,VII.,Them on where each would foremost bleed;
9241,VII.,But could not o'er myself evince
9242,VII.,The like control--But to resume:
9243,VII.,"I loved, and was beloved again;"
9244,VII.,"In sooth, it is a happy doom,"
9245,VII.,But yet where happiest ends in pain.--
9246,VII.,"We met in secret, and the hour"
9247,VII.,Which led me to that lady's bower
9248,VII.,Was fiery Expectation's dower.                                     300
9249,VII.,My days and nights were nothing--all
9250,VII.,"Except that hour which doth recall,"
9251,VII.,"In the long lapse from youth to age,"
9252,VII.,No other like itself: I'd give
9253,VII.,The Ukraine back again to live
9254,VII.,"It o'er once more, and be a page,"
9255,VII.,"The happy page, who was the lord"
9256,VII.,"Of one soft heart, and his own sword,"
9257,VII.,"And had no other gem nor wealth,"
9258,VII.,Save Nature's gift of Youth and Health.                            310
9259,VII.,"We met in secret--doubly sweet[261],"
9260,VII.,"Some say, they find it so to meet;"
9261,VII.,I know not that--I would have given
9262,VII.,My life but to have called her mine
9263,VII.,In the full view of Earth and Heaven;
9264,VII.,For I did oft and long repine
9265,VII.,That we could only meet by stealth.

9267,VIII.,VIII.
9268,VIII.,
9269,VIII.,"""For lovers there are many eyes,"
9270,VIII.,And such there were on us; the Devil
9271,VIII.,On such occasions should be civil--                              320
9272,VIII.,"The Devil!--I'm loth to do him wrong,"
9273,VIII.,"It might be some untoward saint,"
9274,VIII.,"Who would not be at rest too long,"
9275,VIII.,But to his pious bile gave vent--
9276,VIII.,"But one fair night, some lurking spies"
9277,VIII.,Surprised and seized us both.
9278,VIII.,The Count was something more than wroth--
9279,VIII.,"I was unarmed; but if in steel,"
9280,VIII.,"All cap-à-pie from head to heel,"
9281,VIII.,What 'gainst their numbers could I do?                             330
9282,VIII.,"'Twas near his castle, far away"
9283,VIII.,"From city or from succour near,"
9284,VIII.,And almost on the break of day;
9285,VIII.,"I did not think to see another,"
9286,VIII.,My moments seemed reduced to few;
9287,VIII.,"And with one prayer to Mary Mother,"
9288,VIII.,"And, it may be, a saint or two,"
9289,VIII.,"As I resigned me to my fate,"
9290,VIII.,They led me to the castle gate:
9291,VIII.,"Theresa's doom I never knew,                                     340"
9292,VIII.,Our lot was henceforth separate.
9293,VIII.,"An angry man, ye may opine,"
9294,VIII.,"Was he, the proud Count Palatine;"
9295,VIII.,"And he had reason good to be,"
9296,VIII.,But he was most enraged lest such
9297,VIII.,An accident should chance to touch
9298,VIII.,Upon his future pedigree;
9299,VIII.,"Nor less amazed, that such a blot"
9300,VIII.,"His noble 'scutcheon should have got,"
9301,VIII.,While he was highest of his line;                                  350
9302,VIII.,Because unto himself he seemed
9303,VIII.,"The first of men, nor less he deemed"
9304,VIII.,"In others' eyes, and most in mine."
9305,VIII.,'Sdeath! with a _page_--perchance a king
9306,VIII.,Had reconciled him to the thing;
9307,VIII.,But with a stripling of a page--
9308,VIII.,I felt--but cannot paint his rage.

9315,IX.,Who looked as though the speed of thought
9316,IX.,"Were in his limbs; but he was wild,"
9317,IX.,"Wild as the wild deer, and untaught,"
9318,IX.,With spur and bridle undefiled--
9319,IX.,'Twas but a day he had been caught;
9320,IX.,"And snorting, with erected mane,"
9321,IX.,"And struggling fiercely, but in vain,"
9322,IX.,In the full foam of wrath and dread
9323,IX.,To me the desert-born was led:
9324,IX.,"They bound me on, that menial throng,"
9325,IX.,Upon his back with many a thong;                                   370
9326,IX.,They loosed him with a sudden lash--
9327,IX.,Away!--away!--and on we dash!--
9328,IX.,Torrents less rapid and less rash.

9336,X.,"The last of human sounds which rose,"
9337,X.,"As I was darted from my foes,                                      380"
9338,X.,"Was the wild shout of savage laughter,"
9339,X.,Which on the wind came roaring after
9340,X.,A moment from that rabble rout:
9341,X.,"With sudden wrath I wrenched my head,"
9342,X.,"And snapped the cord, which to the mane"
9343,X.,"Had bound my neck in lieu of rein,"
9344,X.,"And, writhing half my form about,"
9345,X.,"Howled back my curse; but 'midst the tread,"
9346,X.,"The thunder of my courser's speed,"
9347,X.,Perchance they did not hear nor heed:                              390
9348,X.,It vexes me--for I would fain
9349,X.,Have paid their insult back again.
9350,X.,I paid it well in after days:
9351,X.,"There is not of that castle gate,"
9352,X.,"Its drawbridge and portcullis' weight,"
9353,X.,Stone--bar--moat--bridge--or barrier left;
9354,X.,"Nor of its fields a blade of grass,"
9355,X.,"Save what grows on a ridge of wall,"
9356,X.,Where stood the hearth-stone of the hall;
9357,X.,"And many a time ye there might pass,                               400"
9358,X.,Nor dream that e'er the fortress was.
9359,X.,"I saw its turrets in a blaze,"
9360,X.,"Their crackling battlements all cleft,"
9361,X.,And the hot lead pour down like rain
9362,X.,"From off the scorched and blackening roof,"
9363,X.,Whose thickness was not vengeance-proof.
9364,X.,"They little thought that day of pain,"
9365,X.,"When launched, as on the lightning's flash,"
9366,X.,"They bade me to destruction dash,"
9367,X.,"That one day I should come again,                                410"
9368,X.,"With twice five thousand horse, to thank"
9369,X.,The Count for his uncourteous ride.
9370,X.,"They played me then a bitter prank,"
9371,X.,"When, with the wild horse for my guide,"
9372,X.,They bound me to his foaming flank:
9373,X.,At length I played them one as frank--
9374,X.,For Time at last sets all things even--

9393,XI.,"On distant heights of some strong hold,"
9394,XI.,"Against the Tartars built of old,"
9395,XI.,No trace of man. The year before
9396,XI.,A Turkish army had marched o'er;
9397,XI.,"And where the Spahi's hoof hath trod,"
9398,XI.,The verdure flies the bloody sod:
9399,XI.,"The sky was dull, and dim, and gray,"
9400,XI.,And a low breeze crept moaning by--                              440
9401,XI.,I could have answered with a sigh--
9402,XI.,"But fast we fled,--away!--away!--"
9403,XI.,And I could neither sigh nor pray;
9404,XI.,And my cold sweat-drops fell like rain
9405,XI.,Upon the courser's bristling mane;
9406,XI.,"But, snorting still with rage and fear,"
9407,XI.,He flew upon his far career:
9408,XI.,"At times I almost thought, indeed,"
9409,XI.,He must have slackened in his speed;
9410,XI.,But no--my bound and slender frame                                 450
9411,XI.,"Was nothing to his angry might,"
9412,XI.,And merely like a spur became:
9413,XI.,Each motion which I made to free
9414,XI.,My swoln limbs from their agony
9415,XI.,Increased his fury and affright:
9416,XI.,"I tried my voice,--'twas faint and low--"
9417,XI.,But yet he swerved as from a blow;
9418,XI.,"And, starting to each accent, sprang"
9419,XI.,As from a sudden trumpet's clang:
9420,XI.,"Meantime my cords were wet with gore,                              460"
9421,XI.,"Which, oozing through my limbs, ran o'er;"
9422,XI.,And in my tongue the thirst became
9423,XI.,A something fierier far than flame.
9424,XI.,
9425,XII.,XII.
9426,XII.,
9427,XII.,"""We neared the wild wood--'twas so wide,"
9428,XII.,I saw no bounds on either side:
9429,XII.,"'Twas studded with old sturdy trees,"
9430,XII.,That bent not to the roughest breeze
9431,XII.,"Which howls down from Siberia's waste,"
9432,XII.,"And strips the forest in its haste,--"
9433,XII.,"But these were few and far between,                                470"
9434,XII.,"Set thick with shrubs more young and green,"
9435,XII.,"Luxuriant with their annual leaves,"
9436,XII.,Ere strown by those autumnal eyes
9437,XII.,"That nip the forest's foliage dead,"
9438,XII.,"Discoloured with a lifeless red[bu],"
9439,XII.,Which stands thereon like stiffened gore
9440,XII.,Upon the slain when battle's o'er;
9441,XII.,And some long winter's night hath shed
9442,XII.,Its frost o'er every tombless head--
9443,XII.,So cold and stark--the raven's beak                                480
9444,XII.,May peck unpierced each frozen cheek:
9445,XII.,"'Twas a wild waste of underwood,"
9446,XII.,"And here and there a chestnut stood,"
9447,XII.,"The strong oak, and the hardy pine;"
9448,XII.,"But far apart--and well it were,"
9449,XII.,Or else a different lot were mine--
9450,XII.,"The boughs gave way, and did not tear"
9451,XII.,My limbs; and I found strength to bear
9452,XII.,"My wounds, already scarred with cold;"
9453,XII.,My bonds forbade to loose my hold.                                 490
9454,XII.,"We rustled through the leaves like wind,--"
9455,XII.,"Left shrubs, and trees, and wolves behind;"
9456,XII.,"By night I heard them on the track,"
9457,XII.,"Their troop came hard upon our back,"
9458,XII.,"With their long gallop, which can tire"
9459,XII.,"The hound's deep hate, and hunter's fire:"
9460,XII.,"Where'er we flew they followed on,"
9461,XII.,Nor left us with the morning sun;
9462,XII.,"Behind I saw them, scarce a rood,"
9463,XII.,"At day-break winding through the wood,                             500"
9464,XII.,And through the night had heard their feet
9465,XII.,"Their stealing, rustling step repeat."
9466,XII.,"Oh! how I wished for spear or sword,"
9467,XII.,"At least to die amidst the horde,"
9468,XII.,And perish--if it must be so--
9469,XII.,"At bay, destroying many a foe!"
9470,XII.,"When first my courser's race begun,"
9471,XII.,I wished the goal already won;
9472,XII.,But now I doubted strength and speed:
9473,XII.,Vain doubt! his swift and savage breed                             510
9474,XII.,Had nerved him like the mountain-roe--
9475,XII.,Nor faster falls the blinding snow
9476,XII.,Which whelms the peasant near the door
9477,XII.,"Whose threshold he shall cross no more,"
9478,XII.,"Bewildered with the dazzling blast,"
9479,XII.,Than through the forest-paths he passed--
9480,XII.,"Untired, untamed, and worse than wild--"
9481,XII.,All furious as a favoured child
9482,XII.,Balked of its wish; or--fiercer still--
9483,XII.,A woman piqued--who has her will!                                  520
9484,XII.,
9485,XIII.,XIII.
9486,XIII.,
9487,XIII.,"""The wood was passed; 'twas more than noon,"
9488,XIII.,"But chill the air, although in June;"
9489,XIII.,Or it might be my veins ran cold--
9490,XIII.,Prolonged endurance tames the bold;
9491,XIII.,"And I was then not what I seem,"
9492,XIII.,"But headlong as a wintry stream,"
9493,XIII.,And wore my feelings out before
9494,XIII.,I well could count their causes o'er:
9495,XIII.,"And what with fury, fear, and wrath,"
9496,XIII.,The tortures which beset my path--                                 530
9497,XIII.,Cold--hunger--sorrow--shame--distress--
9498,XIII.,Thus bound in Nature's nakedness;
9499,XIII.,Sprung from a race whose rising blood
9500,XIII.,"When stirred beyond its calmer mood,"
9501,XIII.,"And trodden hard upon, is like"
9502,XIII.,"The rattle-snake's, in act to strike--"
9503,XIII.,What marvel if this worn-out trunk
9504,XIII.,Beneath its woes a moment sunk?[264]
9505,XIII.,"The earth gave way, the skies rolled round,"
9506,XIII.,I seemed to sink upon the ground;                                  540
9507,XIII.,But erred--for I was fastly bound.
9508,XIII.,"My heart turned sick, my brain grew sore,"
9509,XIII.,"And throbbed awhile, then beat no more:"
9510,XIII.,The skies spun like a mighty wheel;
9511,XIII.,"I saw the trees like drunkards reel,"
9512,XIII.,"And a slight flash sprang o'er my eyes,"
9513,XIII.,Which saw no farther. He who dies
9514,XIII.,"Can die no more than then I died,"
9515,XIII.,O'ertortured by that ghastly ride.[265]
9516,XIII.,"I felt the blackness come and go,                                  550"
9517,XIII.,And strove to wake; but could not make
9518,XIII.,My senses climb up from below:
9519,XIII.,"I felt as on a plank at sea,"
9520,XIII.,"When all the waves that dash o'er thee,"
9521,XIII.,"At the same time upheave and whelm,"
9522,XIII.,And hurl thee towards a desert realm.
9523,XIII.,My undulating life was as
9524,XIII.,The fancied lights that flitting pass
9525,XIII.,"Our shut eyes in deep midnight, when"
9526,XIII.,Fever begins upon the brain;                                       560
9527,XIII.,"But soon it passed, with little pain,"
9528,XIII.,But a confusion worse than such:
9529,XIII.,"I own that I should deem it much,"
9530,XIII.,"Dying, to feel the same again;"
9531,XIII.,And yet I do suppose we must
9532,XIII.,Feel far more ere we turn to dust!
9533,XIII.,No matter! I have bared my brow
9534,XIII.,Full in Death's face--before--and now.
9535,XIII.,
9536,XIV.,XIV.
9537,XIV.,
9538,XIV.,"""My thoughts came back. Where was I? Cold,"
9539,XIV.,"And numb, and giddy: pulse by pulse                              570"
9540,XIV.,"Life reassumed its lingering hold,"
9541,XIV.,"And throb by throb,--till grown a pang"
9542,XIV.,"Which for a moment would convulse,"
9543,XIV.,"My blood reflowed, though thick and chill;"
9544,XIV.,"My ear with uncouth noises rang,"
9545,XIV.,My heart began once more to thrill;
9546,XIV.,"My sight returned, though dim; alas!"
9547,XIV.,"And thickened, as it were, with glass."
9548,XIV.,Methought the dash of waves was nigh;
9549,XIV.,"There was a gleam too of the sky,                                  580"
9550,XIV.,Studded with stars;--it is no dream;
9551,XIV.,The wild horse swims the wilder stream!
9552,XIV.,The bright broad river's gushing tide
9553,XIV.,"Sweeps, winding onward, far and wide,"
9554,XIV.,"And we are half-way, struggling o'er"
9555,XIV.,To yon unknown and silent shore.
9556,XIV.,"The waters broke my hollow trance,"
9557,XIV.,And with a temporary strength
9558,XIV.,My stiffened limbs were rebaptized.
9559,XIV.,"My courser's broad breast proudly braves,                          590"
9560,XIV.,"And dashes off the ascending waves,"
9561,XIV.,And onward we advance!
9562,XIV.,"We reach the slippery shore at length,"
9563,XIV.,"A haven I but little prized,"
9564,XIV.,"For all behind was dark and drear,"
9565,XIV.,And all before was night and fear.
9566,XIV.,How many hours of night or day[266]
9567,XIV.,"In those suspended pangs I lay,"
9568,XIV.,I could not tell; I scarcely knew
9569,XIV.,If this were human breath I drew.                                  600
9570,XIV.,
9571,XV.,XV.
9572,XV.,
9573,XV.,"""With glossy skin, and dripping mane,"
9574,XV.,"And reeling limbs, and reeking flank,"
9575,XV.,The wild steed's sinewy nerves still strain
9576,XV.,Up the repelling bank.
9577,XV.,We gain the top: a boundless plain
9578,XV.,"Spreads through the shadow of the night,"
9579,XV.,"And onward, onward, onward--seems,"
9580,XV.,"Like precipices in our dreams,[267]"
9581,XV.,To stretch beyond the sight;
9582,XV.,"And here and there a speck of white,                               610"
9583,XV.,"Or scattered spot of dusky green,"
9584,XV.,"In masses broke into the light,"
9585,XV.,As rose the moon upon my right:
9586,XV.,But nought distinctly seen
9587,XV.,In the dim waste would indicate
9588,XV.,The omen of a cottage gate;
9589,XV.,No twinkling taper from afar
9590,XV.,Stood like a hospitable star;
9591,XV.,Not even an ignis-fatuus rose[268]
9592,XV.,To make him merry with my woes:                                    620
9593,XV.,That very cheat had cheered me then!
9594,XV.,"Although detected, welcome still,"
9595,XV.,"Reminding me, through every ill,"
9596,XV.,Of the abodes of men.
9597,XV.,
9598,XVI.,XVI.
9599,XVI.,
9600,XVI.,"""Onward we went--but slack and slow;"
9601,XVI.,"His savage force at length o'erspent,"
9602,XVI.,"The drooping courser, faint and low,"
9603,XVI.,All feebly foaming went:
9604,XVI.,A sickly infant had had power
9605,XVI.,To guide him forward in that hour!                                 630
9606,XVI.,"But, useless all to me,"
9607,XVI.,His new-born tameness nought availed--
9608,XVI.,"My limbs were bound; my force had failed,"
9609,XVI.,"Perchance, had they been free."
9610,XVI.,With feeble effort still I tried
9611,XVI.,"To rend the bonds so starkly tied,"
9612,XVI.,But still it was in vain;
9613,XVI.,"My limbs were only wrung the more,"
9614,XVI.,"And soon the idle strife gave o'er,"
9615,XVI.,Which but prolonged their pain.                                  640
9616,XVI.,"The dizzy race seemed almost done,"
9617,XVI.,Although no goal was nearly won:
9618,XVI.,Some streaks announced the coming sun--
9619,XVI.,"How slow, alas! he came!"
9620,XVI.,Methought that mist of dawning gray
9621,XVI.,"Would never dapple into day,"
9622,XVI.,How heavily it rolled away!
9623,XVI.,Before the eastern flame
9624,XVI.,"Rose crimson, and deposed the stars,"
9625,XVI.,"And called the radiance from their cars,[bv]                       650"
9626,XVI.,"And filled the earth, from his deep throne,"
9627,XVI.,"With lonely lustre, all his own."
9628,XVI.,
9629,XVII.,XVII.
9630,XVII.,
9631,XVII.,"""Uprose the sun; the mists were curled"
9632,XVII.,Back from the solitary world
9633,XVII.,Which lay around--behind--before.
9634,XVII.,What booted it to traverse o'er
9635,XVII.,"Plain--forest--river? Man nor brute,"
9636,XVII.,"Nor dint of hoof, nor print of foot,"
9637,XVII.,Lay in the wild luxuriant soil--
9638,XVII.,"No sign of travel, none of toil--                                  660"
9639,XVII.,The very air was mute:
9640,XVII.,"And not an insect's shrill small horn,[269]"
9641,XVII.,Nor matin bird's new voice was borne
9642,XVII.,"From herb nor thicket. Many a _werst,_"
9643,XVII.,"Panting as if his heart would burst,"
9644,XVII.,The weary brute still staggered on;
9645,XVII.,And still we were--or seemed--alone:
9646,XVII.,"At length, while reeling on our way,"
9647,XVII.,"Methought I heard a courser neigh,"
9648,XVII.,From out yon tuft of blackening firs.                              670
9649,XVII.,Is it the wind those branches stirs?[270]
9650,XVII.,"No, no! from out the forest prance"
9651,XVII.,A trampling troop; I see them come!
9652,XVII.,In one vast squadron they advance!
9653,XVII.,I strove to cry--my lips were dumb!
9654,XVII.,The steeds rush on in plunging pride;
9655,XVII.,But where are they the reins to guide?
9656,XVII.,"A thousand horse, and none to ride!"
9657,XVII.,"With flowing tail, and flying mane,"
9658,XVII.,"Wide nostrils never stretched by pain,                             680"
9659,XVII.,"Mouths bloodless to the bit or rein,"
9660,XVII.,"And feet that iron never shod,"
9661,XVII.,"And flanks unscarred by spur or rod,"
9662,XVII.,"A thousand horse, the wild, the free,"
9663,XVII.,"Like waves that follow o'er the sea,"
9664,XVII.,"Came thickly thundering on,"
9665,XVII.,As if our faint approach to meet!
9666,XVII.,"The sight re-nerved my courser's feet,"
9667,XVII.,"A moment staggering, feebly fleet,"
9668,XVII.,"A moment, with a faint low neigh,                                  690"
9669,XVII.,"He answered, and then fell!"
9670,XVII.,"With gasps and glazing eyes he lay,"
9671,XVII.,"And reeking limbs immoveable,"
9672,XVII.,His first and last career is done!
9673,XVII.,"On came the troop--they saw him stoop,"
9674,XVII.,They saw me strangely bound along
9675,XVII.,His back with many a bloody thong.
9676,XVII.,"They stop--they start--they snuff the air,"
9677,XVII.,"Gallop a moment here and there,"
9678,XVII.,"Approach, retire, wheel round and round,                           700"
9679,XVII.,"Then plunging back with sudden bound,"
9680,XVII.,"Headed by one black mighty steed,"
9681,XVII.,"Who seemed the Patriarch of his breed,"
9682,XVII.,Without a single speck or hair
9683,XVII.,Of white upon his shaggy hide;
9684,XVII.,"They snort--they foam--neigh--swerve aside,"
9685,XVII.,"And backward to the forest fly,"
9686,XVII.,"By instinct, from a human eye."
9687,XVII.,"They left me there to my despair,"
9688,XVII.,"Linked to the dead and stiffening wretch,                          710"
9689,XVII.,"Whose lifeless limbs beneath me stretch,"
9690,XVII.,"Relieved from that unwonted weight,"
9691,XVII.,From whence I could not extricate
9692,XVII.,"Nor him nor me--and there we lay,"
9693,XVII.,The dying on the dead!
9694,XVII.,I little deemed another day
9695,XVII.,"Would see my houseless, helpless head."
9696,XVII.,
9697,XVII.,"""And there from morn to twilight bound,"
9698,XVII.,"I felt the heavy hours toil round,"
9699,XVII.,With just enough of life to see                                    720
9700,XVII.,"My last of suns go down on me,"
9701,XVII.,"In hopeless certainty of, mind,"
9702,XVII.,That makes us feel at length resigned
9703,XVII.,To that which our foreboding years
9704,XVII.,Present the worst and last of fears:
9705,XVII.,"Inevitable--even a boon,"
9706,XVII.,"Nor more unkind for coming soon,"
9707,XVII.,"Yet shunned and dreaded with such care,"
9708,XVII.,As if it only were a snare
9709,XVII.,That Prudence might escape:                                      730
9710,XVII.,"At times both wished for and implored,"
9711,XVII.,"At times sought with self-pointed sword,"
9712,XVII.,Yet still a dark and hideous close
9713,XVII.,"To even intolerable woes,"
9714,XVII.,And welcome in no shape.
9715,XVII.,"And, strange to say, the sons of pleasure,"
9716,XVII.,They who have revelled beyond measure
9717,XVII.,"In beauty, wassail, wine, and treasure,"
9718,XVII.,"Die calm, or calmer, oft than he"
9719,XVII.,Whose heritage was Misery.                                         740
9720,XVII.,For he who hath in turn run through
9721,XVII.,"All that was beautiful and new,"
9722,XVII.,"Hath nought to hope, and nought to leave;"
9723,XVII.,"And, save the future, (which is viewed"
9724,XVII.,"Not quite as men are base or good,"
9725,XVII.,"But as their nerves may be endued,)"
9726,XVII.,With nought perhaps to grieve:
9727,XVII.,"The wretch still hopes his woes must end,"
9728,XVII.,"And Death, whom he should deem his friend,"
9729,XVII.,"Appears, to his distempered eyes,                                  750"
9730,XVII.,"Arrived to rob him of his prize,"
9731,XVII.,The tree of his new Paradise.
9732,XVII.,"To-morrow would have given him all,"
9733,XVII.,"Repaid his pangs, repaired his fall;"
9734,XVII.,To-morrow would have been the first
9735,XVII.,"Of days no more deplored or curst,"
9736,XVII.,"But bright, and long, and beckoning years,"
9737,XVII.,"Seen dazzling through the mist of tears,"
9738,XVII.,Guerdon of many a painful hour;
9739,XVII.,To-morrow would have given him power                               760
9740,XVII.,To rule--to shine--to smite--to save--
9741,XVII.,And must it dawn upon his grave?
9742,XVII.,
9743,XVIII.,XVIII.
9744,XVIII.,
9745,XVIII.,"""The sun was sinking--still I lay"
9746,XVIII.,Chained to the chill and stiffening steed!
9747,XVIII.,I thought to mingle there our clay;[271]
9748,XVIII.,"And my dim eyes of death had need,"
9749,XVIII.,No hope arose of being freed.
9750,XVIII.,"I cast my last looks up the sky,"
9751,XVIII.,And there between me and the sun[272]
9752,XVIII.,"I saw the expecting raven fly,                                     770"
9753,XVIII.,"Who scarce would wait till both should die,"
9754,XVIII.,Ere his repast begun;[273]
9755,XVIII.,"He flew, and perched, then flew once more,"
9756,XVIII.,And each time nearer than before;
9757,XVIII.,"I saw his wing through twilight flit,"
9758,XVIII.,And once so near me he alit
9759,XVIII.,"I could have smote, but lacked the strength;"
9760,XVIII.,"But the slight motion of my hand,"
9761,XVIII.,"And feeble scratching of the sand,"
9762,XVIII.,"The exerted throat's faint struggling noise,                       780"
9763,XVIII.,"Which scarcely could be called a voice,"
9764,XVIII.,Together scared him off at length.
9765,XVIII.,I know no more--my latest dream
9766,XVIII.,Is something of a lovely star
9767,XVIII.,"Which fixed my dull eyes from afar,"
9768,XVIII.,"And went and came with wandering beam,"
9769,XVIII.,And of the cold--dull--swimming--dense

10284,PREFACE,"In the course of a visit to the city of Ravenna in the summer of 1819,"
10285,PREFACE,it was suggested to the author that having composed something on the
10286,PREFACE,"subject of Tasso's confinement, he should do the same on Dante's"
10287,PREFACE,"exile,--the tomb of the poet forming one of the principal objects[279]"
10288,PREFACE,"of interest in that city, both to the native and to the stranger."
10289,PREFACE,
10290,PREFACE,"""On this hint I spake,"" and the result has been the following four"
10291,PREFACE,"cantos, in _terza rima_, now offered to the reader. If they are"
10292,PREFACE,"understood and approved, it is my purpose to continue the poem in"
10293,PREFACE,various other cantos to its natural conclusion in the present age. The
10294,PREFACE,reader is requested to suppose that Dante addresses him in the interval
10295,PREFACE,"between the conclusion of the _Divina Commedia_ and his death, and"
10296,PREFACE,"shortly before the latter event, foretelling the fortunes of Italy in"
10297,PREFACE,general in the ensuing centuries. In adopting this plan I have had in my
10298,PREFACE,"mind the Cassandra of Lycophron,[280] and the Prophecy of Nereus by"
10299,PREFACE,"Horace, as well as the Prophecies of Holy Writ. The measure adopted is"
10300,PREFACE,"the _terza rima_ of Dante, which I am not aware to have seen hitherto"
10301,PREFACE,"_tried in our language, except it may be by Mr. Hayley_,[281] of whose"
10302,PREFACE,"translation I never saw but one extract, quoted in the notes to _Caliph"
10303,PREFACE,Vathek_; so that--if I do not err--this poem may be considered as a
10304,PREFACE,"metrical experiment. The cantos are short, and about the same length of"
10305,PREFACE,"those of the poet, whose name I have borrowed and most likely taken in"
10306,PREFACE,vain.
10307,PREFACE,
10308,PREFACE,"Amongst the inconveniences of authors in the present day, it is"
10309,PREFACE,"difficult for any who have a name, good or bad, to escape translation. I"
10310,PREFACE,have had the fortune to see the fourth canto of _Childe Harold_[282]
10311,PREFACE,"translated into Italian _versi sciolti_,--that is, a poem written in the"
10312,PREFACE,"_Spenserean stanza_ into _blank verse_, without regard to the natural"
10313,PREFACE,"divisions of the stanza or the sense. If the present poem, being on a"
10314,PREFACE,"national topic, should chance to undergo the same fate, I would request"
10315,PREFACE,the Italian reader to remember that when I have failed in the imitation
10316,PREFACE,"of his great ""Padre Alighier,""[283] I have failed in imitating that"
10317,PREFACE,"which all study and few understand, since to this very day it is not yet"
10318,PREFACE,settled what was the meaning of the allegory[284] in the first canto of
10319,PREFACE,"the _Inferno_, unless Count Marchetti's ingenious and probable"
10320,PREFACE,conjecture may be considered as having decided the question.
10321,PREFACE,
10322,PREFACE,"He may also pardon my failure the more, as I am not quite sure that he"
10323,PREFACE,"would be pleased with my success, since the Italians, with a pardonable"
10324,PREFACE,"nationality, are particularly jealous of all that is left them as a"
10325,PREFACE,nation--their literature; and in the present bitterness of the classic
10326,PREFACE,"and romantic war, are but ill disposed to permit a foreigner even to"
10327,PREFACE,"approve or imitate them, without finding some fault with his"
10328,PREFACE,"ultramontane presumption. I can easily enter into all this, knowing what"
10329,PREFACE,"would be thought in England of an Italian imitator of Milton, or if a"
10330,PREFACE,"translation of Monti, Pindemonte, or Arici,[285] should be held up to"
10331,PREFACE,the rising generation as a model for their future poetical essays. But I
10332,PREFACE,"perceive that I am deviating into an address to the Italian reader,"
10333,PREFACE,"where my business is with the English one; and be they few or many, I"
10334,PREFACE,must take my leave of both.

11869,ADVERTISEMENT.,
11870,ADVERTISEMENT.,"The Morgante Maggiore, of the first canto of which this translation is"
11871,ADVERTISEMENT.,"offered, divides with the Orlando Innamorato the honour of having formed"
11872,ADVERTISEMENT.,and suggested the style and story of Ariosto.[332] The great defects of
11873,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Boiardo were his treating too seriously the narratives of chivalry, and"
11874,ADVERTISEMENT.,"his harsh style. Ariosto, in his continuation, by a judicious mixture of"
11875,ADVERTISEMENT.,"the gaiety of Pulci, has avoided the one; and Berni, in his reformation"
11876,ADVERTISEMENT.,"of Boiardo's poem, has corrected the other. Pulci may be considered as"
11877,ADVERTISEMENT.,"the precursor and model of Berni altogether, as he has partly been to"
11878,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Ariosto, however inferior to both his copyists. He is no less the"
11879,ADVERTISEMENT.,founder of a new style of poetry very lately sprung up in England. I
11880,ADVERTISEMENT.,allude to that of the ingenious Whistlecraft. The serious poems on
11881,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Roncesvalles in the same language, and more particularly the excellent"
11882,ADVERTISEMENT.,"one of Mr. Merivale, are to be traced to the same source.[333] It has"
11883,ADVERTISEMENT.,never yet been decided entirely whether Pulci's intention was or was not
11884,ADVERTISEMENT.,to deride the religion which is one of his favourite topics. It appears
11885,ADVERTISEMENT.,"to me, that such an intention would have been no less hazardous to the"
11886,ADVERTISEMENT.,"poet than to the priest, particularly in that age and country; and the"
11887,ADVERTISEMENT.,"permission to publish the poem, and its reception among the classics of"
11888,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Italy, prove that it neither was nor is so interpreted. That he"
11889,ADVERTISEMENT.,"intended to ridicule the monastic life, and suffered his imagination to"
11890,ADVERTISEMENT.,"play with the simple dulness of his converted giant, seems evident"
11891,ADVERTISEMENT.,enough; but surely it were as unjust to accuse him of irreligion on this
11892,ADVERTISEMENT.,"account, as to denounce Fielding for his Parson Adams, Barnabas,[334]"
11893,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Thwackum, Supple, and the Ordinary in Jonathan Wild,--or Scott, for the"
11894,ADVERTISEMENT.,"exquisite use of his Covenanters in the ""Tales of my Landlord."""
11895,ADVERTISEMENT.,
11896,ADVERTISEMENT.,In the following translation I have used the liberty of the original
11897,ADVERTISEMENT.,"with the proper names, as Pulci uses Gan, Ganellon, or Ganellone; Carlo,"
11898,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Carlomagno, or Carlornano; Rondel, or Rondello, etc., as it suits his"
11899,ADVERTISEMENT.,convenience; so has the translator. In other respects the version is
11900,ADVERTISEMENT.,faithful to the best of the translator's ability in combining his
11901,ADVERTISEMENT.,interpretation of the one language with the not very easy task of
11902,ADVERTISEMENT.,"reducing it to the same versification in the other. The reader, on"
11903,ADVERTISEMENT.,"comparing it with the original, is requested to remember that the"
11904,ADVERTISEMENT.,"antiquated language of Pulci, however pure, is not easy to the"
11905,ADVERTISEMENT.,"generality of Italians themselves, from its great mixture of Tuscan"
11906,ADVERTISEMENT.,proverbs; and he may therefore be more indulgent to the present attempt.
11907,ADVERTISEMENT.,"How far the translator has succeeded, and whether or no he shall"
11908,ADVERTISEMENT.,"continue the work, are questions which the public will decide. He was"
11909,ADVERTISEMENT.,"induced to make the experiment partly by his love for, and partial"
11910,ADVERTISEMENT.,"intercourse with, the Italian language, of which it is so easy to"

12585,LX.,"One day, as with Orlando they both strayed,"
12586,LX.,"And sauntered here and there, where'er they chose,"
12587,LX.,"The Abbot showed a chamber, where arrayed"

12599,LXI.,"Upon his shoulder a great tub he laid,"

12602,LXI.,
12603,LXII.,LXII.
12604,LXII.,
12605,LXII.,"Arrived there, a prodigious noise he hears,"
12606,LXII.,Which suddenly along the forest spread;
12607,LXII.,Whereat from out his quiver he prepares
12608,LXII.,"An arrow for his bow, and lifts his head;"
12609,LXII.,"And lo! a monstrous herd of swine appears,"
12610,LXII.,"And onward rushes with tempestuous tread,"
12611,LXII.,And to the fountain's brink precisely pours;
12612,LXII.,So that the Giant's joined by all the boars.
12613,LXII.,
12614,LXIII.,LXIII.
12615,LXIII.,
12616,LXIII.,"Morgante at a venture shot an arrow,"
12617,LXIII.,"Which pierced a pig precisely in the ear,"
12618,LXIII.,And passed unto the other side quite through;
12619,LXIII.,"So that the boar, defunct, lay tripped up near."
12620,LXIII.,"Another, to revenge his fellow farrow,"
12621,LXIII.,"Against the Giant rushed in fierce career,"
12622,LXIII.,"And reached the passage with so swift a foot,"

12624,LXIII.,
12625,LXIV.,LXIV.
12626,LXIV.,
12627,LXIV.,"Perceiving that the pig was on him close,"
12628,LXIV.,"He gave him such a punch upon the head[345],"
12629,LXIV.,"As floored him so that he no more arose,"
12630,LXIV.,Smashing the very bone; and he fell dead
12631,LXIV.,"Next to the other. Having seen such blows,"
12632,LXIV.,The other pigs along the valley fled;
12633,LXIV.,"Morgante on his neck the bucket took,"
12634,LXIV.,"Full from the spring, which neither swerved nor shook."
12635,LXIV.,
12636,LXV.,LXV.
12637,LXV.,
12638,LXV.,"The tub was on one shoulder, and there were"

12642,LXV.,"Orlando, seeing him so soon appear"
12643,LXV.,"With the dead boars, and with that brimful vase,"
12644,LXV.,Marvelled to see his strength so very great;
12645,LXV.,"So did the Abbot, and set wide the gate."
12646,LXV.,
12647,LXVI.,LXVI.
12648,LXVI.,
12649,LXVI.,"The monks, who saw the water fresh and good[346],"
12650,LXVI.,"Rejoiced, but much more to perceive the pork;"
12651,LXVI.,All animals are glad at sight of food:
12652,LXVI.,"They lay their breviaries to sleep, and work"
12653,LXVI.,"With greedy pleasure, and in such a mood,"
12654,LXVI.,That the flesh needs no salt beneath their fork.
12655,LXVI.,"Of rankness and of rot there is no fear,"

12657,LXVI.,
12658,LXVII.,LXVII.
12659,LXVII.,
12660,LXVII.,"As though they wished to burst at once, they ate;"
12661,LXVII.,"And gorged so that, as if the bones had been"
12662,LXVII.,"In water, sorely grieved the dog and cat,"
12663,LXVII.,Perceiving that they all were picked too clean.
12664,LXVII.,"The Abbot, who to all did honour great,"
12665,LXVII.,"A few days after this convivial scene,"
12666,LXVII.,"Gave to Morgante a fine horse, well trained,"

12669,LXVIII.,LXVIII.
12670,LXVIII.,
12671,LXVIII.,"The horse Morgante to a meadow led,"
12672,LXVIII.,"To gallop, and to put him to the proof,"
12673,LXVIII.,"Thinking that he a back of iron had,"
12674,LXVIII.,Or to skim eggs unbroke was light enough;
12675,LXVIII.,"But the horse, sinking with the pain, fell dead,"
12676,LXVIII.,"And burst, while cold on earth lay head and hoof."
12677,LXVIII.,"Morgante said, ""Get up, thou sulky cur!"""
12678,LXVIII.,And still continued pricking with the spur.
12679,LXVIII.,
12680,LXIX.,LXIX.
12681,LXIX.,
12682,LXIX.,"But finally he thought fit to dismount,"
12683,LXIX.,"And said, ""I am as light as any feather,"
12684,LXIX.,"And he has burst;--to this what say you, Count?"""
12685,LXIX.,"Orlando answered, ""Like a ship's mast rather"
12686,LXIX.,"You seem to me, and with the truck for front:"

12696,LXX.,"If it should prove God's will, a goodly knight;"
12697,LXX.,Nor will you napping there discover me.

12702,LXXI.,LXXI.
12703,LXXI.,
12704,LXXI.,"The Giant said, ""Then carry him I will,"
12705,LXXI.,Since that to carry me he was so slack--
12706,LXXI.,"To render, as the gods do, good for ill;"
12707,LXXI.,"But lend a hand to place him on my back."""
12708,LXXI.,"Orlando answered, ""If my counsel still"
12709,LXXI.,"May weigh, Morgante, do not undertake"
12710,LXXI.,"To lift or carry this dead courser, who,"
12711,LXXI.,"As you have done to him, will do to you."

12719,LXXII.,"""But help him on my back,"" Morgante said,"

12730,LXXIII.,"And hoisting up the horse from where he fell,"

12733,LXXIII.,And then he made two gambols with the horse.

12735,LXXIV.,LXXIV.
12736,LXXIV.,
12737,LXXIV.,Morgante was like any mountain framed;
12738,LXXIV.,So if he did this 'tis no prodigy;
12739,LXXIV.,"But secretly himself Orlando blamed,"
12740,LXXIV.,Because he was one of his family;
12741,LXXIV.,"And fearing that he might be hurt or maimed,"
12742,LXXIV.,Once more he bade him lay his burden by:
12743,LXXIV.,"""Put down, nor bear him further the desert in."""
12744,LXXIV.,"Morgante said, ""I'll carry him for certain."""
12745,LXXIV.,
12746,LXXV.,LXXV.
12747,LXXV.,
12748,LXXV.,"He did; and stowed him in some nook away,"

13545,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"historical fact worthy of commemoration."" More than once in his letters"
13546,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"to Murray he reverts to this profession of accuracy, and encloses some"
13547,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"additional note, in which he points out and rectifies an occasional"
13548,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"deviation from the historical record. In this respect, at any rate, he"

13551,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"exacter and, so, more lifelike picture of the Venetian Republic. It is"
13552,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"plain, too, that he was bitten with the love of study for its own sake,"
13553,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"with a premature passion for erudition, and that he sought and found"
13554,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,relief from physical and intellectual excitement in the intricacies of
13555,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"research. If his history is at fault, it was not from any lack of"
13556,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"diligence on his part, but because the materials at his disposal or"
13557,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,within his cognizance were inaccurate and misleading. He makes no
13558,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,mention of the huge collection of Venetian archives which had recently
13559,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"been deposited in the Convent of the Frari, or of Doria's transcript of"
13560,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"Sanudo's Diaries, bequeathed in 1816 to the Library of St. Mark; but he"

13562,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"(1466-1535), the _Storia, etc._, of Andrea Navagero (1483-1529), and the"
13563,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"_Principj di Storia, etc._, of Vettor Sandi, which belongs to the latter"
13564,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"half of the eighteenth century. Byron's chroniclers were ancient, but"

13566,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"Medwin, _Conversations_, p. 173), they depart in numerous particulars"
13567,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,from the facts recorded in contemporary documents. Unquestionably the
13568,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"legend, as it appears in Sanudo's perplexing and uncritical narrative"
13569,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"(see, for the translation of an original version of the Italian,"
13570,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"_Appendix_, pp. 462-467), is more dramatic than the ""low beginnings"" of"
13571,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"the myth, which may be traced to the annalists of the fourteenth and"
13572,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"fifteenth centuries; but, like other legends, it is insusceptible of"

13588,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"object in view, to make his readers smile, to provoke their"
13589,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"astonishment, that he affected a severity foreign to his genius and at"
13590,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,variance with his record. It was an agreeable thought that he could so
13591,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"easily pass from one extreme to another, from _Manfred_ to _Marino"

13594,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,480) at the expense of his own countrymen. But there were other
13595,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,influences at work. He had been powerfully impressed by the energy and
13596,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"directness of Alfieri's work, and he was eager to emulate the gravity"
13597,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"and simplicity, if not the terseness and conciseness, of his style and"
13598,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"language. The drama was a new world to conquer, and so far as ""his own"
13599,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"literature"" was concerned it appeared that success might be attainable"
13600,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"by ""a severer approach to the rules"" (Letter to Murray, February 16,"
13601,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,1821)--that by taking Alfieri as his model he might step into the first
13602,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,rank of English dramatists.
13603,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,
13604,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"Goethe thought that Byron failed ""to understand the purpose"" of the"
13605,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"""three unities,"" that he regarded the law as an end in itself, and did"
13606,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,not perceive that if a play was comprehensible the unities might be
13607,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"neglected and disregarded. It is possible that his ""blind obedience to"
13608,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"the law"" may have been dictated by the fervour of a convert; but it is"
13609,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,equally possible that he looked beyond the law or its fulfilment to an
13610,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"ulterior object, the discomfiture of the romantic school, with its"
13611,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"contempt for regularity, its passionate appeal from art to nature. If he"
13612,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"was minded to raise a ""Grecian temple of the purest architecture"""
13613,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"(_Letters_, 1901, v. Appendix III. p. 559), it was not without some"

13615,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"""grotesque edifice"" of barbarian contemporaries and rivals. Byron was"
13616,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"""ever a fighter,"" and his claim to regularity, to a closer preservation"
13617,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"of the ""unities,"" was of the nature of a challenge."

13619,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"_Marino Faliero_ was dedicated to ""Baron Goethe,"" but the letter which"
13620,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,should have contained the dedication was delayed in transit. Goethe
13621,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,never saw the dedication till it was placed in his hands by John Murray
13622,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"the Third, in 1831, but he read the play, and after Byron's death bore"
13623,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"testimony to its peculiar characteristics and essential worth. ""Lord"

13632,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,

13640,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"_Letters_, 1901, v. 221-228), an announcement reached Byron that his"

13642,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,"this he protested by every means in his power, and finally, on"

13682,INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.,
13683,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
13684,PREFACE.,
13685,PREFACE.,The conspiracy of the Doge Marino Faliero is one of the most remarkable
13686,PREFACE.,"events in the annals of the most singular government, city, and people"
13687,PREFACE.,of modern history. It occurred in the year 1355. Every thing about
13688,PREFACE.,"Venice is, or was, extraordinary--her aspect is like a dream, and her"
13689,PREFACE.,history is like a romance. The story of this Doge is to be found in all
13690,PREFACE.,"her Chronicles, and particularly detailed in the ""Lives of the Doges,"""
13691,PREFACE.,"by Marin Sanuto, which is given in the Appendix. It is simply and"
13692,PREFACE.,"clearly related, and is perhaps more dramatic in itself than any scenes"
13693,PREFACE.,which can be founded upon the subject.
13694,PREFACE.,
13695,PREFACE.,Marino Faliero appears to have been a man of talents and of courage. I
13696,PREFACE.,find him commander-in-chief of the land forces at the siege of
13697,PREFACE.,"Zara,[359] where he beat the King of Hungary and his army of eighty"
13698,PREFACE.,"thousand men, killing eight thousand men, and keeping the besieged at"
13699,PREFACE.,the same time in check; an exploit to which I know none similar in
13700,PREFACE.,"history, except that of Cæsar at Alesia,[360] and of Prince Eugene at"
13701,PREFACE.,Belgrade. He was afterwards commander of the fleet in the same war. He
13702,PREFACE.,"took Capo d'Istria. He was ambassador at Genoa and Rome,--at which last"
13703,PREFACE.,he received the news of his election to the dukedom; his absence being a
13704,PREFACE.,"proof that he sought it by no intrigue, since he was apprised of his"
13705,PREFACE.,predecessor's death and his own succession at the same moment. But he
13706,PREFACE.,appears to have been of an ungovernable temper. A story is told by
13707,PREFACE.,"Sanuto, of his having, many years before, when podesta and captain at"
13708,PREFACE.,"Treviso, boxed the ears of the bishop, who was somewhat tardy in"
13709,PREFACE.,"bringing the Host.[361] For this, honest Sanuto ""saddles him with a"
13710,PREFACE.,"judgment,"" as Thwackum did Square;[362] but he does not tell us whether"
13711,PREFACE.,he was punished or rebuked by the Senate for this outrage at the time of
13712,PREFACE.,"its commission. He seems, indeed, to have been afterwards at peace with"
13713,PREFACE.,"the church, for we find him ambassador at Rome, and invested with the"
13714,PREFACE.,"fief of Val di Marino, in the march of Treviso, and with the title of"
13715,PREFACE.,"count, by Lorenzo, Count-bishop of Ceneda. For these facts my"
13716,PREFACE.,"authorities are Sanuto, Vettor Sandi,[363] Andrea Navagero,[364] and the"
13717,PREFACE.,"account of the siege of Zara, first published by the indefatigable Abate"
13718,PREFACE.,"Morelli, in his _Monumenti Veneziani di varia Letteratura_, printed in"
13719,PREFACE.,"1796,[365] all of which I have looked over in the original language. The"
13720,PREFACE.,"moderns, Darù, Sismondi, and Laugier, nearly agree with the ancient"
13721,PREFACE.,chroniclers. Sismondi attributes the conspiracy to his _jealousy_; but I
13722,PREFACE.,"find this nowhere asserted by the national historians. Vettor Sandi,"
13723,PREFACE.,"indeed, says that ""Altri scrissero che....dalla gelosa suspizion di esso"
13724,PREFACE.,"Doge siasi fatto (Michel Steno) staccar con violenza,"" etc., etc.; but"
13725,PREFACE.,"this appears to have been by no means the general opinion, nor is it"
13726,PREFACE.,"alluded to by Sanuto, or by Navagero; and Sandi himself adds, a moment"
13727,PREFACE.,"after, that ""per altre Veneziane memorie traspiri, che non il _solo_"
13728,PREFACE.,desiderio di vendetta lo dispose alla congiura ma anche la innata
13729,PREFACE.,"abituale ambizion sua, per cui aneleva a farsi principe independente."""
13730,PREFACE.,The first motive appears to have been excited by the gross affront of
13731,PREFACE.,"the words written by Michel Steno on the ducal chair, and by the light"
13732,PREFACE.,"and inadequate sentence of the Forty on the offender, who was one of"
13733,PREFACE.,"their ""tre Capi.""[366] The attentions of Steno himself appear to have"
13734,PREFACE.,"been directed towards one of her damsels, and not to the"
13735,PREFACE.,"""Dogaressa""[367] herself, against whose fame not the slightest"
13736,PREFACE.,"insinuation appears, while she is praised for her beauty, and remarked"
13737,PREFACE.,for her youth. Neither do I find it asserted (unless the hint of Sandi
13738,PREFACE.,be an assertion) that the Doge was actuated by jealousy of his wife; but
13739,PREFACE.,"rather by respect for her, and for his own honour, warranted by his past"
13740,PREFACE.,services and present dignity.
13741,PREFACE.,
13742,PREFACE.,"I know not that the historical facts are alluded to in English, unless"
13743,PREFACE.,by Dr. Moore in his View of Italy[368]. His account is false and
13744,PREFACE.,"flippant, full of stale jests about old men and young wives, and"
13745,PREFACE.,wondering at so great an effect from so slight a cause. How so acute
13746,PREFACE.,and severe an observer of mankind as the author of Zeluco could wonder
13747,PREFACE.,at this is inconceivable. He knew that a basin of water spilt on Mrs.
13748,PREFACE.,"Masham's gown deprived the Duke of Marlborough of his command, and led"
13749,PREFACE.,to the inglorious peace of Utrecht--that Louis XIV. was plunged into the
13750,PREFACE.,"most desolating wars, because his minister was nettled at his finding"
13751,PREFACE.,"fault with a window, and wished to give him another occupation--that"
13752,PREFACE.,Helen lost Troy--that Lucretia expelled the Tarquins from Rome--and that
13753,PREFACE.,Cava brought the Moors to Spain--that an insulted husband led the Gauls
13754,PREFACE.,"to Clusium, and thence to Rome--that a single verse of Frederick"
13755,PREFACE.,"II.[369] of Prussia on the Abbé de Bernis, and a jest on Madame de"
13756,PREFACE.,"Pompadour, led to the battle of Rosbach--that the elopement of"
13757,PREFACE.,Dearbhorgil[370] with Mac Murchad conducted the English to the slavery
13758,PREFACE.,of Ireland that a personal pique between Maria Antoinette and the Duke
13759,PREFACE.,"of Orleans precipitated the first expulsion of the Bourbons--and, not to"
13760,PREFACE.,"multiply instances of the _teterrima causa,_ that Commodus, Domitian,"
13761,PREFACE.,"and Caligula fell victims not to their public tyranny, but to private"
13762,PREFACE.,vengeance--and that an order to make Cromwell disembark from the ship in
13763,PREFACE.,which he would have sailed to America destroyed both King and
13764,PREFACE.,"Commonwealth. After these instances, on the least reflection it is"
13765,PREFACE.,indeed extraordinary in Dr. Moore to seem surprised that a man used to
13766,PREFACE.,"command, who had served and swayed in the most important offices, should"
13767,PREFACE.,"fiercely resent, in a fierce age, an unpunished affront, the grossest"
13768,PREFACE.,"that can be offered to a man, be he prince or peasant. The age of"
13769,PREFACE.,"Faliero is little to the purpose, unless to favour it--"
13770,PREFACE.,
13771,PREFACE.,"""The young man's wrath is like [light] straw on fire,"
13772,PREFACE.,"_But like red hot steel is the old man's ire._"""

13777,PREFACE.,"Old age is slow at both."""
13778,PREFACE.,
13779,PREFACE.,"Laugier's reflections are more philosophical:--""Tale fù il fine"
13780,PREFACE.,"ignominioso di un' uomo, che la sua nascità, la sua età, il suo"
13781,PREFACE.,carattere dovevano tener lontano dalle passioni produttrici di grandi
13782,PREFACE.,delitti. I suoi _talenti_ per lungo tempo esercitati ne' maggiori
13783,PREFACE.,"impieghi, la sua capacità sperimentata ne' governi e nelle ambasciate,"
13784,PREFACE.,"gli avevano acquistato la stima e la fiducia de' cittadini, ed avevano"
13785,PREFACE.,uniti i suffragj per collocarlo alla testa della repubblica. Innalzato
13786,PREFACE.,"ad un grado che terminava gloriosamente la sua vita, il risentimento di"
13787,PREFACE.,un' ingiuria leggiera insinuò nel suo cuore tal veleno che bastò a
13788,PREFACE.,"corrompere le antiche sue qualità, e a condurlo al termine dei"
13789,PREFACE.,"scellerati; serio esempio, che prova _non esservi età, in cui la"
13790,PREFACE.,"prudenza umana sia sicura, e che nell' uomo restano sempre passioni"
13791,PREFACE.,"capaci a disonorarlo, quando non invigili sopra se stesso_.""[371]"
13792,PREFACE.,
13793,PREFACE.,Where did Dr. Moore find that Marino Faliero begged his life? I have
13794,PREFACE.,"searched the chroniclers, and find nothing of the kind: it is true that"
13795,PREFACE.,"he avowed all. He was conducted to the place of torture, but there is no"
13796,PREFACE.,mention made of any application for mercy on his part; and the very
13797,PREFACE.,circumstance of their having taken him to the rack seems to argue any
13798,PREFACE.,"thing but his having shown a want of firmness, which would doubtless"
13799,PREFACE.,"have been also mentioned by those minute historians, who by no means"
13800,PREFACE.,"favour him: such, indeed, would be contrary to his character as a"
13801,PREFACE.,"soldier, to the age in which he lived, and _at_ which he died, as it is"
13802,PREFACE.,"to the truth of history. I know no justification, at any distance of"
13803,PREFACE.,"time, for calumniating an historical character: surely truth belongs to"
13804,PREFACE.,"the dead, and to the unfortunate: and they who have died upon a scaffold"
13805,PREFACE.,"have generally had faults enough of their own, without attributing to"
13806,PREFACE.,them that which the very incurring of the perils which conducted them to
13807,PREFACE.,"their violent death renders, of all others, the most improbable. The"
13808,PREFACE.,black veil which is painted over the place of Marino Faliero amongst
13809,PREFACE.,"the Doges, and the Giants' Staircase[372], where he was crowned, and"
13810,PREFACE.,"discrowned, and decapitated, struck forcibly upon my imagination; as did"
13811,PREFACE.,"his fiery character and strange story. I went, in 1819, in search of his"
13812,PREFACE.,"tomb more than once to the church San Giovanni e San Paolo; and, as I"
13813,PREFACE.,"was standing before the monument of another family, a priest came up to"
13814,PREFACE.,"me and said, ""I can show you finer monuments than that."" I told him that"
13815,PREFACE.,"I was in search of that of the Faliero family, and particularly of the"
13816,PREFACE.,"Doge Marino's. ""Oh,"" said he, ""I will show it you;"" and, conducting me"
13817,PREFACE.,"to the outside, pointed out a sarcophagus in the wall with an illegible"
13818,PREFACE.,"inscription[373]. He said that it had been in a convent adjoining, but"
13819,PREFACE.,"was removed after the French came, and placed in its present situation;"
13820,PREFACE.,that he had seen the tomb opened at its removal; there were still some
13821,PREFACE.,"bones remaining, but no positive vestige of the decapitation. The"
13822,PREFACE.,equestrian statue[374] of which I have made mention in the third act as
13823,PREFACE.,"before that church is not, however, of a Faliero, but of some other now"
13824,PREFACE.,"obsolete warrior, although of a later date. There were two other Doges"
13825,PREFACE.,"of this family prior to Marino; Ordelafo, who fell in battle at Zara, in"
13826,PREFACE.,"1117 (where his descendant afterwards conquered the Huns), and Vital"
13827,PREFACE.,"Faliero, who reigned in 1082. The family, originally from Fano, was of"
13828,PREFACE.,the most illustrious in blood and wealth in the city of once the most
13829,PREFACE.,wealthy and still the most ancient families in Europe. The length I have
13830,PREFACE.,gone into on this subject will show the interest I have taken in it.
13831,PREFACE.,"Whether I have succeeded or not in the tragedy, I have at least"
13832,PREFACE.,transferred into our language an historical fact worthy of
13833,PREFACE.,commemoration.
13834,PREFACE.,
13835,PREFACE.,It is now four years that I have meditated this work; and before I had
13836,PREFACE.,"sufficiently examined the records, I was rather disposed to have made it"
13837,PREFACE.,"turn on a jealousy in Faliero. But, perceiving no foundation for this in"
13838,PREFACE.,"historical truth, and aware that jealousy is an exhausted passion in the"
13839,PREFACE.,"drama, I have given it a more historical form. I was, besides, well"
13840,PREFACE.,"advised by the late Matthew Lewis[375] on that point, in talking with"
13841,PREFACE.,"him of my intention at Venice in 1817. ""If you make him jealous,"" said"
13842,PREFACE.,"he, ""recollect that you have to contend with established writers, to say"
13843,PREFACE.,"nothing of Shakespeare, and an exhausted subject:--stick to the old"
13844,PREFACE.,"fiery Doge's natural character, which will bear you out, if properly"
13845,PREFACE.,"drawn; and make your plot as regular as you can."" Sir William"
13846,PREFACE.,Drummond[376] gave me nearly the same counsel. How far I have followed
13847,PREFACE.,"these instructions, or whether they have availed me, is not for me to"
13848,PREFACE.,"decide. I have had no view to the stage; in its present state it is,"
13849,PREFACE.,"perhaps, not a very exalted object of ambition; besides, I have been too"
13850,PREFACE.,much behind the scenes to have thought it so at any time.[ct] And I
13851,PREFACE.,cannot conceive any man of irritable feeling[cu] putting himself at the
13852,PREFACE.,"mercies of an audience. The sneering reader, and the loud critic, and"
13853,PREFACE.,"the tart review, are scattered and distant calamities; but the trampling"
13854,PREFACE.,"of an intelligent or of an ignorant audience on a production which, be"
13855,PREFACE.,"it good or bad, has been a mental labour to the writer, is a palpable"
13856,PREFACE.,"and immediate grievance, heightened by a man's doubt of their competency"
13857,PREFACE.,"to judge, and his certainty of his own imprudence in electing them his"
13858,PREFACE.,judges. Were I capable of writing a play which could be deemed
13859,PREFACE.,"stage-worthy, success would give me no pleasure, and failure great pain."
13860,PREFACE.,"It is for this reason that, even during the time of being one of the"
13861,PREFACE.,"committee of one of the theatres, I never made the attempt, and never"
13862,PREFACE.,"will[377]. But I wish that others would, for surely there is dramatic"
13863,PREFACE.,"power somewhere, where Joanna Baillie, and Milman, and John Wilson"
13864,PREFACE.,exist. The _City of the Plague_[1816] and the _Fall of Jerusalem_ [1820]
13865,PREFACE.,"are full of the best ""_matériel_"" for tragedy that has been seen since"
13866,PREFACE.,"Horace Walpole, except passages of _Ethwald_[1802] and _De"
13867,PREFACE.,"Montfort_[1798]. It is the fashion to underrate Horace Walpole; firstly,"
13868,PREFACE.,"because he was a nobleman, and secondly, because he was a gentleman;"
13869,PREFACE.,"but, to say nothing of the composition of his incomparable letters, and"
13870,PREFACE.,"of the _Castle of Otranto_[1765], he is the ""Ultimus Romanorum,"" the"
13871,PREFACE.,"author of the _Mysterious Mother_[1768], a tragedy of the highest order,"
13872,PREFACE.,and not a puling love-play. He is the father of the first romance and of
13873,PREFACE.,"the last tragedy in our language, and surely worthy of a higher place"
13874,PREFACE.,"than any living writer, be he who he may.[378]"
13875,PREFACE.,
13876,PREFACE.,"In speaking of the drama of _Marino Faliero_, I forgot to mention that"
13877,PREFACE.,"the desire of preserving, though still too remote, a nearer approach to"
13878,PREFACE.,"unity than the irregularity, which is the reproach of the English"
13879,PREFACE.,"theatrical compositions, permits, has induced me to represent the"
13880,PREFACE.,"conspiracy as already formed, and the Doge acceding to it; whereas, in"
13881,PREFACE.,"fact, it was of his own preparation and that of Israel Bertuccio. The"
13882,PREFACE.,"other characters (except that of the Duchess), incidents, and almost the"
13883,PREFACE.,"time, which was wonderfully short for such a design in real life, are"
13884,PREFACE.,"strictly historical, except that all the consultations took place in the"
13885,PREFACE.,"palace. Had I followed this, the unity would have been better preserved;"
13886,PREFACE.,but I wished to produce the Doge in the full assembly of the
13887,PREFACE.,"conspirators, instead of monotonously placing him always in dialogue"
13888,PREFACE.,"with the same individuals. For the real facts, I refer to the"

14007,ACT I.,Would bring contempt on all authority.
14008,ACT I.,
14009,ACT I.,_Doge_. Know you not Venice? Know you not the Forty?
14010,ACT I.,But we shall see anon.
14011,ACT I.,
14012,ACT I.,"_Ber. F._ (_addressing_ VINCENZO, _then entering_.)"
14013,ACT I.,How now--what tidings?
14014,ACT I.,
14015,ACT I.,_Vin_. I am charged to tell his Highness that the court
14016,ACT I.,"Has passed its resolution, and that, soon                           10"
14017,ACT I.,"As the due forms of judgment are gone through,"
14018,ACT I.,The sentence will be sent up to the Doge;
14019,ACT I.,In the mean time the Forty doth salute
14020,ACT I.,"The Prince of the Republic, and entreat"
14021,ACT I.,His acceptation of their duty.
14022,ACT I.,
14023,ACT I.,_Doge_.                       Yes--
14024,ACT I.,"They are wond'rous dutiful, and ever humble."
14025,ACT I.,"Sentence is passed, you say?"
14026,ACT I.,
14027,ACT I.,"_Vin_.                      It is, your Highness:"
14028,ACT I.,"The President was sealing it, when I"
14029,ACT I.,"Was called in, that no moment might be lost"
14030,ACT I.,In forwarding the intimation due                                    20
14031,ACT I.,"Not only to the Chief of the Republic,"
14032,ACT I.,"But the complainant, both in one united."
14033,ACT I.,
14034,ACT I.,"_Ber. F._ Are you aware, from aught you have perceived,"
14035,ACT I.,Of their decision?
14036,ACT I.,
14037,ACT I.,"_Vin_.            No, my Lord; you know"
14038,ACT I.,The secret custom of the courts in Venice.
14039,ACT I.,
14040,ACT I.,"_Ber. F._ True; but there still is something given to guess,"
14041,ACT I.,Which a shrewd gleaner and quick eye would catch at;
14042,ACT I.,"A whisper, or a murmur, or an air"
14043,ACT I.,More or less solemn spread o'er the tribunal.
14044,ACT I.,"The Forty are but men--most worthy men,                             30"
14045,ACT I.,"And wise, and just, and cautious--this I grant--"
14046,ACT I.,And secret as the grave to which they doom
14047,ACT I.,"The guilty: but with all this, in their aspects--"
14048,ACT I.,"At least in some, the juniors of the number--"
14049,ACT I.,"A searching eye, an eye like yours, Vincenzo,"
14050,ACT I.,Would read the sentence ere it was pronounced.
14051,ACT I.,
14052,ACT I.,"_Vin_. My Lord, I came away upon the moment,"
14053,ACT I.,And had no leisure to take note of that
14054,ACT I.,"Which passed among the judges, even in seeming;"
14055,ACT I.,"My station near the accused too, Michel Steno,                      40"
14056,ACT I.,Made me--
14057,ACT I.,
14058,ACT I.,_Doge_ (_abruptly_). And how looked _he_? deliver that.
14059,ACT I.,
14060,ACT I.,"_Vin_. Calm, but not overcast, he stood resigned"
14061,ACT I.,"To the decree, whate'er it were;--but lo!"
14062,ACT I.,"It comes, for the perusal of his Highness."
14063,ACT I.,
14064,ACT I.,_Enter the_ SECRETARY _of the Forty_.
14065,ACT I.,
14066,ACT I.,_Sec_. The high tribunal of the Forty sends
14067,ACT I.,"Health and respect to the Doge Faliero,[da]"
14068,ACT I.,"Chief magistrate of Venice, and requests"
14069,ACT I.,His Highness to peruse and to approve
14070,ACT I.,"The sentence passed on Michel Steno, born"
14071,ACT I.,"Patrician, and arraigned upon the charge                            50"
14072,ACT I.,"Contained, together with its penalty,"
14073,ACT I.,Within the rescript which I now present.
14074,ACT I.,
14075,ACT I.,"_Doge_. Retire, and wait without."
14076,ACT I.,[_Exeunt_ SECRETARY _and_ VINCENZO.]
14077,ACT I.,Take thou this paper:
14078,ACT I.,The misty letters vanish from my eyes;
14079,ACT I.,I cannot fix them.
14080,ACT I.,
14081,ACT I.,"_Ber. F._          Patience, my dear Uncle:"
14082,ACT I.,"Why do you tremble thus?--nay, doubt not, all"
14083,ACT I.,Will be as could be wished.
14084,ACT I.,
14085,ACT I.,_Doge_.                    Say on.
14086,ACT I.,
14087,ACT I.,"_Ber. F._ (_reading_).           ""Decreed"
14088,ACT I.,"In council, without one dissenting voice,"
14089,ACT I.,"That Michel Steno, by his own confession,"
14090,ACT I.,Guilty on the last night of Carnival                                60
14091,ACT I.,Of having graven on the ducal throne
14092,ACT I.,"The following words--""[383]"
14093,ACT I.,
14094,ACT I.,_Doge_.                Would'st thou repeat them?
14095,ACT I.,"Would'st _thou_ repeat them--_thou_, a Faliero,"
14096,ACT I.,"Harp on the deep dishonour of our house,"
14097,ACT I.,Dishonoured in its Chief--that Chief the Prince
14098,ACT I.,"Of Venice, first of cities?--To the sentence."
14099,ACT I.,
14100,ACT I.,"_Ber. F._ Forgive me, my good Lord; I will obey--"
14101,ACT I.,"(_Reads_) ""That Michel Steno be detained a month"
14102,ACT I.,"In close arrest.""[384]"
14103,ACT I.,
14104,ACT I.,_Doge_.             Proceed.
14105,ACT I.,
14106,ACT I.,"_Ber. F._                  My Lord, 'tis finished."
14107,ACT I.,
14108,ACT I.,_Doge_. How say you?--finished! Do I dream?--'tis false--           70
14109,ACT I.,Give me the paper--(_snatches the paper and reads_)--
14110,ACT I.,"""'Tis decreed in council"
14111,ACT I.,"That Michel Steno""--Nephew, thine arm!"
14112,ACT I.,
14113,ACT I.,"_Ber. F._                          Nay,"
14114,ACT I.,"Cheer up, be calm; this transport is uncalled for--"
14115,ACT I.,Let me seek some assistance.
14116,ACT I.,
14117,ACT I.,"_Doge_.                     Stop, sir--Stir not--"
14118,ACT I.,'Tis past.
14119,ACT I.,
14120,ACT I.,_Ber. F._   I cannot but agree with you
14121,ACT I.,The sentence is too slight for the offence;
14122,ACT I.,It is not honourable in the Forty
14123,ACT I.,To affix so slight a penalty to that
14124,ACT I.,"Which was a foul affront to you, and even"
14125,ACT I.,"To them, as being your subjects; but 'tis not                       80"
14126,ACT I.,Yet without remedy: you can appeal
14127,ACT I.,"To them once more, or to the Avogadori,"
14128,ACT I.,"Who, seeing that true justice is withheld,"
14129,ACT I.,"Will now take up the cause they once declined,"
14130,ACT I.,And do you right upon the bold delinquent.
14131,ACT I.,"Think you not thus, good Uncle? why do you stand"
14132,ACT I.,"So fixed? You heed me not:--I pray you, hear me!"
14133,ACT I.,
14134,ACT I.,"_Doge_ (_dashing down the ducal bonnet, and offering to"
14135,ACT I.,"trample upon it, exclaims, as he is withheld by his nephew_)."
14136,ACT I.,Oh! that the Saracen were in St. Mark's!
14137,ACT I.,Thus would I do him homage.
14138,ACT I.,
14139,ACT I.,_Ber. F._                  For the sake
14140,ACT I.,"Of Heaven and all its saints, my Lord--"
14141,ACT I.,
14142,ACT I.,_Doge_.                                Away!                        90
14143,ACT I.,"Oh, that the Genoese were in the port!"
14144,ACT I.,"Oh, that the Huns whom I o'erthrew at Zara[385]"
14145,ACT I.,Were ranged around the palace!
14146,ACT I.,
14147,ACT I.,_Ber. F._                      'Tis not well
14148,ACT I.,In Venice' Duke to say so.
14149,ACT I.,
14150,ACT I.,_Doge_.                   Venice' Duke!
14151,ACT I.,"Who now is Duke in Venice? let me see him,"
14152,ACT I.,That he may do me right.
14153,ACT I.,
14154,ACT I.,_Ber. F._               If you forget
14155,ACT I.,"Your office, and its dignity and duty."
14156,ACT I.,"Remember that of man, and curb this passion."
14157,ACT I.,The Duke of Venice----
14158,ACT I.,
14159,ACT I.,_Doge_ (_interrupting him_). There is no such thing--
14160,ACT I.,"It is a word--nay, worse--a worthless by-word:                     100"
14161,ACT I.,"The most despised, wronged, outraged, helpless wretch,"
14162,ACT I.,"Who begs his bread, if 'tis refused by one,"
14163,ACT I.,May win it from another kinder heart;
14164,ACT I.,"But he, who is denied his right by those"
14165,ACT I.,"Whose place it is to do no wrong, is poorer"
14166,ACT I.,Than the rejected beggar--he's a slave--
14167,ACT I.,"And that am I--and thou--and all our house,"
14168,ACT I.,Even from this hour; the meanest artisan
14169,ACT I.,"Will point the finger, and the haughty noble"
14170,ACT I.,May spit upon us:--where is our redress?                           110
14171,ACT I.,
14172,ACT I.,"_Ber. F._ The law, my Prince--"
14173,ACT I.,
14174,ACT I.,_Doge_ (_interrupting him_). You see what it has done;
14175,ACT I.,I asked no remedy but from the law--[386]
14176,ACT I.,I sought no vengeance but redress by law--
14177,ACT I.,I called no judges but those named by law--
14178,ACT I.,"As Sovereign, I appealed unto my subjects,"
14179,ACT I.,"The very subjects who had made me Sovereign,"
14180,ACT I.,And gave me thus a double right to be so.
14181,ACT I.,"The rights of place and choice, of birth and service,"
14182,ACT I.,"Honours and years, these scars, these hoary hairs,"
14183,ACT I.,The travel--toil--the perils--the fatigues--                       120
14184,ACT I.,"The blood and sweat of almost eighty years,"
14185,ACT I.,"Were weighed i' the balance, 'gainst the foulest stain,"
14186,ACT I.,"The grossest insult, most contemptuous crime"
14187,ACT I.,"Of a rank, rash patrician--and found wanting!"
14188,ACT I.,And this is to be borne!
14189,ACT I.,
14190,ACT I.,_Ber. F._                I say not that:--
14191,ACT I.,"In case your fresh appeal should be rejected,"
14192,ACT I.,We will find other means to make all even.
14193,ACT I.,
14194,ACT I.,_Doge_. Appeal again! art thou my brother's son?
14195,ACT I.,A scion of the house of Faliero?
14196,ACT I.,The nephew of a Doge? and of that blood                            130
14197,ACT I.,Which hath already given three dukes to Venice?
14198,ACT I.,But thou say'st well--we must be humble now.
14199,ACT I.,
14200,ACT I.,_Ber. F._ My princely Uncle! you are too much moved;--
14201,ACT I.,"I grant it was a gross offence, and grossly"
14202,ACT I.,Left without fitting punishment: but still
14203,ACT I.,"This fury doth exceed the provocation,"
14204,ACT I.,"Or any provocation: if we are wronged,"
14205,ACT I.,"We will ask justice; if it be denied,"
14206,ACT I.,We'll take it; but may do all this in calmness--
14207,ACT I.,Deep Vengeance is the daughter of deep Silence.                    140
14208,ACT I.,"I have yet scarce a third part of your years,"
14209,ACT I.,"I love our house, I honour you, its Chief,"
14210,ACT I.,"The guardian of my youth, and its instructor--"
14211,ACT I.,"But though I understand your grief, and enter"
14212,ACT I.,"In part of your disdain, it doth appal me"
14213,ACT I.,"To see your anger, like our Adrian waves,"
14214,ACT I.,"O'ersweep all bounds, and foam itself to air."
14215,ACT I.,
14216,ACT I.,_Doge_. I tell thee--_must_ I tell thee--what thy father
14217,ACT I.,Would have required no words to comprehend?
14218,ACT I.,Hast thou no feeling save the external sense                       150
14219,ACT I.,Of torture from the touch? hast thou no soul--
14220,ACT I.,No pride--no passion--no deep sense of honour?
14221,ACT I.,
14222,ACT I.,"_Ber. F._ 'Tis the first time that honour has been doubted,"
14223,ACT I.,"And were the last, from any other sceptic."
14224,ACT I.,
14225,ACT I.,"_Doge_. You know the full offence of this born villain,"
14226,ACT I.,"This creeping, coward, rank, acquitted felon,"
14227,ACT I.,"Who threw his sting into a poisonous libel,[db]"
14228,ACT I.,"And on the honour of--Oh God! my wife,"
14229,ACT I.,"The nearest, dearest part of all men's honour,"
14230,ACT I.,Left a base slur to pass from mouth to mouth                       160
14231,ACT I.,"Of loose mechanics, with all coarse foul comments,"
14232,ACT I.,"And villainous jests, and blasphemies obscene;"
14233,ACT I.,"While sneering nobles, in more polished guise,"
14234,ACT I.,"Whispered the tale, and smiled upon the lie"
14235,ACT I.,"Which made me look like them--a courteous wittol,"
14236,ACT I.,"Patient--aye--proud, it may be, of dishonour."
14237,ACT I.,
14238,ACT I.,"_Ber. F._ But still it was a lie--you knew it false,"
14239,ACT I.,And so did all men.
14240,ACT I.,
14241,ACT I.,"_Doge_.             Nephew, the high Roman"
14242,ACT I.,"Said, ""Cæsar's wife must not even be suspected,""[387]"
14243,ACT I.,And put her from him.
14244,ACT I.,
14245,ACT I.,_Ber. F._             True--but in those days----                  170
14246,ACT I.,
14247,ACT I.,"_Doge_. What is it that a Roman would not suffer,"
14248,ACT I.,That a Venetian Prince must bear? old Dandolo[dc]
14249,ACT I.,"Refused the diadem of all the Cæsars,[388]"
14250,ACT I.,And wore the ducal cap _I_ trample on--
14251,ACT I.,Because 'tis now degraded.
14252,ACT I.,
14253,ACT I.,_Ber. F._                  'Tis even so.
14254,ACT I.,
14255,ACT I.,_Doge_. It is--it is;--I did not visit on
14256,ACT I.,The innocent creature thus most vilely slandered
14257,ACT I.,"Because she took an old man for her lord,"
14258,ACT I.,For that he had been long her father's friend
14259,ACT I.,"And patron of her house, as if there were                          180"
14260,ACT I.,No love in woman's heart but lust of youth
14261,ACT I.,And beardless faces;--I did not for this
14262,ACT I.,"Visit the villain's infamy on her,"
14263,ACT I.,"But craved my country's justice on his head,"
14264,ACT I.,The justice due unto the humblest being
14265,ACT I.,"Who hath a wife whose faith is sweet to him,"
14266,ACT I.,Who hath a home whose hearth is dear to him--
14267,ACT I.,"Who hath a name whose honour's all to him,"
14268,ACT I.,When these are tainted by the accursing breath
14269,ACT I.,Of Calumny and Scorn.
14270,ACT I.,
14271,ACT I.,_Ber. F._             And what redress                             190
14272,ACT I.,Did you expect as his fit punishment?
14273,ACT I.,
14274,ACT I.,_Doge_. Death! Was I not the Sovereign of the state--
14275,ACT I.,"Insulted on his very throne, and made"
14276,ACT I.,A mockery to the men who should obey me?
14277,ACT I.,Was I not injured as a husband? scorned
14278,ACT I.,"As man? reviled, degraded, as a Prince?"
14279,ACT I.,Was not offence like his a complication
14280,ACT I.,Of insult and of treason?--and he lives!
14281,ACT I.,Had he instead of on the Doge's throne
14282,ACT I.,"Stamped the same brand upon a peasant's stool,                     200"
14283,ACT I.,His blood had gilt the threshold; for the carle
14284,ACT I.,Had stabbed him on the instant.
14285,ACT I.,
14286,ACT I.,"_Ber. F._                      Do not doubt it,"
14287,ACT I.,f    He shall not live till sunset--leave to me
14288,ACT I.,"The means, and calm yourself."
14289,ACT I.,
14290,ACT I.,"_Doge_.                       Hold, nephew: this"
14291,ACT I.,Would have sufficed but yesterday; at present
14292,ACT I.,I have no further wrath against this man.
14293,ACT I.,
14294,ACT I.,_Ber. F._ What mean you? is not the offence redoubled
14295,ACT I.,By this most rank--I will not say--acquittal;
14296,ACT I.,"For it is worse, being full acknowledgment"
14297,ACT I.,"Of the offence, and leaving it unpunished?                         210"
14298,ACT I.,
14299,ACT I.,"_Doge_. It is _redoubled_, but not now by him:"
14300,ACT I.,The Forty hath decreed a month's arrest--
14301,ACT I.,We must obey the Forty.
14302,ACT I.,
14303,ACT I.,_Ber. F._               Obey _them_!
14304,ACT I.,Who have forgot their duty to the Sovereign?
14305,ACT I.,
14306,ACT I.,"_Doge_. Why, yes;--boy, you perceive it then at last;"
14307,ACT I.,Whether as fellow citizen who sues
14308,ACT I.,"For justice, or as Sovereign who commands it,"
14309,ACT I.,They have defrauded me of both my rights
14310,ACT I.,(For here the Sovereign is a citizen);
14311,ACT I.,"But, notwithstanding, harm not thou a hair                         220"
14312,ACT I.,Of Steno's head--he shall not wear it long.
14313,ACT I.,
14314,ACT I.,"_Ber. F._ Not twelve hours longer, had you left to me"
14315,ACT I.,"The mode and means; if you had calmly heard me,"
14316,ACT I.,"I never meant this miscreant should escape,"
14317,ACT I.,"But wished you to suppress such gusts of passion,"
14318,ACT I.,That we more surely might devise together
14319,ACT I.,His taking off.
14320,ACT I.,
14321,ACT I.,"_Doge_.         No, nephew, he must live;"
14322,ACT I.,"At least, just now--a life so vile as his"
14323,ACT I.,Were nothing at this hour; in th' olden time[dd]
14324,ACT I.,"Some sacrifices asked a single victim,                             230"
14325,ACT I.,Great expiations had a hecatomb.
14326,ACT I.,
14327,ACT I.,_Ber. F._ Your wishes are my law: and yet I fain
14328,ACT I.,Would prove to you how near unto my heart
14329,ACT I.,The honour of our house must ever be.
14330,ACT I.,
14331,ACT I.,_Doge_. Fear not; you shall have time and place of proof:
14332,ACT I.,"But be not thou too rash, as I have been."
14333,ACT I.,I am ashamed of my own anger now;
14334,ACT I.,"I pray you, pardon me."
14335,ACT I.,
14336,ACT I.,"_Ber. F._              Why, that's my uncle!"
14337,ACT I.,"The leader, and the statesman, and the chief"
14338,ACT I.,"Of commonwealths, and sovereign of himself!                        240"
14339,ACT I.,I wondered to perceive you so forget
14340,ACT I.,"All prudence in your fury at these years,"
14341,ACT I.,Although the cause--
14342,ACT I.,
14343,ACT I.,_Doge_.              Aye--think upon the cause--
14344,ACT I.,"Forget it not:--When you lie down to rest,"
14345,ACT I.,Let it be black among your dreams; and when
14346,ACT I.,"The morn returns, so let it stand between"
14347,ACT I.,"The Sun and you, as an ill-omened cloud"
14348,ACT I.,Upon a summer-day of festival:
14349,ACT I.,"So will it stand to me;--but speak not, stir not,--"
14350,ACT I.,"Leave all to me; we shall have much to do,                         250"
14351,ACT I.,"And you shall have a part.--But now retire,"
14352,ACT I.,'Tis fit I were alone.

14354,ACT I.,_Ber. F._ (_taking up and placing the ducal bonnet on the table_).
14355,ACT I.,"Ere I depart,"
14356,ACT I.,"I pray you to resume what you have spurned,"
14357,ACT I.,"Till you can change it--haply, for a crown!"
14358,ACT I.,"And now I take my leave, imploring you"
14359,ACT I.,"In all things to rely upon my duty,"
14360,ACT I.,"As doth become your near and faithful kinsman,"
14361,ACT I.,And not less loyal citizen and subject.

14368,ACT I.,With the all-swaying majesty of Kings;
14369,ACT I.,"Thou idle, gilded, and degraded toy,"
14370,ACT I.,Let me resume thee as I would a vizor.                  [_Puts it on_.
14371,ACT I.,How my brain aches beneath thee! and my temples
14372,ACT I.,Throb feverish under thy dishonest weight.
14373,ACT I.,Could I not turn thee to a diadem?
14374,ACT I.,Could I not shatter the Briarean sceptre
14375,ACT I.,"Which in this hundred-handed Senate rules,"
14376,ACT I.,"Making the people nothing, and the Prince                          270"
14377,ACT I.,A pageant? In my life I have achieved
14378,ACT I.,"Tasks not less difficult--achieved for them,"
14379,ACT I.,Who thus repay me! Can I not requite them?
14380,ACT I.,Oh for one year! Oh! but for even a day
14381,ACT I.,"Of my full youth, while yet my body served"
14382,ACT I.,"My soul as serves the generous steed his lord,"
14383,ACT I.,"I would have dashed amongst them, asking few"
14384,ACT I.,In aid to overthrow these swoln patricians;
14385,ACT I.,But now I must look round for other hands
14386,ACT I.,To serve this hoary head; but it shall plan                        280
14387,ACT I.,In such a sort as will not leave the task
14388,ACT I.,"Herculean, though as yet 'tis but a chaos"
14389,ACT I.,Of darkly brooding thoughts: my fancy is
14390,ACT I.,"In her first work, more nearly to the light"
14391,ACT I.,Holding the sleeping images of things
14392,ACT I.,For the selection of the pausing judgment.--
14393,ACT I.,The troops are few in----
14394,ACT I.,
14395,ACT I.,_Enter_ VINCENZO.
14396,ACT I.,
14397,ACT I.,_Vin_.                     There is one without
14398,ACT I.,Craves audience of your Highness.
14399,ACT I.,
14400,ACT I.,_Doge_.                           I'm unwell--
14401,ACT I.,"I can see no one, not even a patrician--"
14402,ACT I.,Let him refer his business to the Council.                         290
14403,ACT I.,
14404,ACT I.,"_Vin_. My Lord, I will deliver your reply;"
14405,ACT I.,"It cannot much import--he's a plebeian,"
14406,ACT I.,"The master of a galley, I believe."
14407,ACT I.,
14408,ACT I.,_Doge_. How! did you say the patron of a galley?[389]
14409,ACT I.,That is--I mean--a servant of the state:
14410,ACT I.,"Admit him, he may be on public service."
14411,ACT I.,[_Exit_ VINCENZO.
14412,ACT I.,
14413,ACT I.,_Doge_ (_solus_). This patron may be sounded; I will try him.
14414,ACT I.,I know the people to be discontented:
14415,ACT I.,"They have cause, since Sapienza's[390] adverse day,"
14416,ACT I.,"When Genoa conquered: they have further cause,                     300"
14417,ACT I.,"Since they are nothing in the state, and in"
14418,ACT I.,"The city worse than nothing--mere machines,"
14419,ACT I.,To serve the nobles' most patrician pleasure.
14420,ACT I.,"The troops have long arrears of pay, oft promised,"
14421,ACT I.,And murmur deeply--any hope of change
14422,ACT I.,Will draw them forward: they shall pay themselves
14423,ACT I.,With plunder:--but the priests--I doubt the priesthood
14424,ACT I.,Will not be with us; they have hated me
14425,ACT I.,"Since that rash hour, when, maddened with the drone,"
14426,ACT I.,"I smote the tardy Bishop at Treviso,[391]                          310"
14427,ACT I.,"Quickening his holy march; yet, ne'ertheless,"
14428,ACT I.,"They may be won, at least their Chief at Rome,"
14429,ACT I.,"By some well-timed concessions; but, above"
14430,ACT I.,"All things, I must be speedy: at my hour"
14431,ACT I.,Of twilight little light of life remains.
14432,ACT I.,"Could I free Venice, and avenge my wrongs,"
14433,ACT I.,"I had lived too long, and willingly would sleep"
14434,ACT I.,"Next moment with my sires; and, wanting this,"
14435,ACT I.,Better that sixty of my fourscore years
14436,ACT I.,"Had been already where--how soon, I care not--                     320"
14437,ACT I.,The whole must be extinguished;--better that
14438,ACT I.,"They ne'er had been, than drag me on to be"
14439,ACT I.,The thing these arch-oppressors fain would make me.
14440,ACT I.,Let me consider--of efficient troops
14441,ACT I.,There are three thousand posted at----
14442,ACT I.,
14443,ACT I.,_Enter_ VINCENZO _and_ ISRAEL BERTUCCIO.
14444,ACT I.,
14445,ACT I.,_Vin_.                                 May it please
14446,ACT I.,"Your Highness, the same patron whom I spake of"
14447,ACT I.,Is here to crave your patience.
14448,ACT I.,
14449,ACT I.,"_Doge_.                        Leave the chamber,"
14450,ACT I.,Vincenzo.--
14451,ACT I.,[_Exit_ VINCENZO.
14452,ACT I.,"Sir, you may advance--what would you?"
14453,ACT I.,
14454,ACT I.,_I. Ber_.  Redress.
14455,ACT I.,
14456,ACT I.,_Doge_.             Of whom?
14457,ACT I.,
14458,ACT I.,_I. Ber_.                    Of God and of the Doge.
14459,ACT I.,
14460,ACT I.,"_Doge_. Alas! my friend, you seek it of the twain                  330"
14461,ACT I.,Of least respect and interest in Venice.
14462,ACT I.,You must address the Council.
14463,ACT I.,
14464,ACT I.,_I. Ber_.                    'Twere in vain;
14465,ACT I.,For he who injured me is one of them.
14466,ACT I.,
14467,ACT I.,_Doge_. There's blood upon thy face--how came it there?
14468,ACT I.,
14469,ACT I.,"_I. Ber_. 'Tis mine, and not the first I've shed for Venice,"
14470,ACT I.,But the first shed by a Venetian hand:
14471,ACT I.,A noble smote me.
14472,ACT I.,
14473,ACT I.,_Doge_.          Doth he live?
14474,ACT I.,
14475,ACT I.,_I. Ber_.                     Not long--
14476,ACT I.,"But for the hope I had and have, that you,"
14477,ACT I.,"My Prince, yourself a soldier, will redress"
14478,ACT I.,"Him, whom the laws of discipline and Venice                        340"
14479,ACT I.,Permit not to protect himself:--if not--
14480,ACT I.,I say no more.
14481,ACT I.,
14482,ACT I.,_Doge_.        But something you would do--
14483,ACT I.,Is it not so?
14484,ACT I.,
14485,ACT I.,"_I. Ber_.     I am a man, my Lord."
14486,ACT I.,
14487,ACT I.,_Doge_. Why so is he who smote you.
14488,ACT I.,
14489,ACT I.,_I. Ber_.                          He is called so;
14490,ACT I.,"Nay, more, a noble one--at least, in Venice:"
14491,ACT I.,"But since he hath forgotten that I am one,"
14492,ACT I.,"And treats me like a brute, the brute may turn--"
14493,ACT I.,'Tis said the worm will.
14494,ACT I.,
14495,ACT I.,_Doge_.                 Say--his name and lineage?
14496,ACT I.,
14497,ACT I.,_I. Ber_. Barbaro.
14498,ACT I.,
14499,ACT I.,_Doge_.           What was the cause? or the pretext?
14500,ACT I.,
14501,ACT I.,"_I. Ber_. I am the chief of the arsenal,[392] employed             350"
14502,ACT I.,At present in repairing certain galleys
14503,ACT I.,But roughly used by the Genoese last year.
14504,ACT I.,This morning comes the noble Barbaro[393]
14505,ACT I.,"Full of reproof, because our artisans"
14506,ACT I.,"Had left some frivolous order of his house,"
14507,ACT I.,To execute the state's decree: I dared
14508,ACT I.,To justify the men--he raised his hand;--
14509,ACT I.,Behold my blood! the first time it e'er flowed
14510,ACT I.,Dishonourably.
14511,ACT I.,
14512,ACT I.,_Doge_.        Have you long time served?
14513,ACT I.,
14514,ACT I.,"_I. Ber_. So long as to remember Zara's siege,                     360"
14515,ACT I.,"And fight beneath the Chief who beat the Huns there,"
14516,ACT I.,"Sometime my general, now the Doge Faliero.--"
14517,ACT I.,
14518,ACT I.,_Doge_. How! are we comrades?--the State's ducal robes
14519,ACT I.,"Sit newly on me, and you were appointed"
14520,ACT I.,Chief of the arsenal ere I came from Rome;
14521,ACT I.,So that I recognised you not. Who placed you?
14522,ACT I.,
14523,ACT I.,_I. Ber_. The late Doge; keeping still my old command
14524,ACT I.,As patron of a galley: my new office
14525,ACT I.,Was given as the reward of certain scars
14526,ACT I.,(So was your predecessor pleased to say):                          370
14527,ACT I.,I little thought his bounty would conduct me
14528,ACT I.,To his successor as a helpless plaintiff;
14529,ACT I.,"At least, in such a cause."
14530,ACT I.,
14531,ACT I.,_Doge_.                   Are you much hurt?
14532,ACT I.,
14533,ACT I.,_I. Ber_. Irreparably in my self-esteem.
14534,ACT I.,
14535,ACT I.,"_Doge_. Speak out; fear nothing: being stung at heart,"
14536,ACT I.,What would you do to be revenged on this man?
14537,ACT I.,
14538,ACT I.,"_I. Ber_. That which I dare not name, and yet will do."
14539,ACT I.,
14540,ACT I.,_Doge_. Then wherefore came you here?
14541,ACT I.,
14542,ACT I.,"_I. Ber_.                             I come for justice,"
14543,ACT I.,"Because my general is Doge, and will not"
14544,ACT I.,"See his old soldier trampled on. Had any,                          380"
14545,ACT I.,"Save Faliero, filled the ducal throne,"
14546,ACT I.,This blood had been washed out in other blood.
14547,ACT I.,
14548,ACT I.,_Doge_. You come to me for justice--unto _me!_
14549,ACT I.,"The Doge of Venice, and I cannot give it;"
14550,ACT I.,I cannot even obtain it--'twas denied
14551,ACT I.,To me most solemnly an hour ago!
14552,ACT I.,
14553,ACT I.,_I. Ber_. How says your Highness?
14554,ACT I.,
14555,ACT I.,_Doge_.                           Steno is condemned
14556,ACT I.,To a month's confinement.
14557,ACT I.,
14558,ACT I.,_I. Ber_.                 What! the same who dared
14559,ACT I.,"To stain the ducal throne with those foul words,"
14560,ACT I.,That have cried shame to every ear in Venice?                      390
14561,ACT I.,
14562,ACT I.,"_Doge_. Aye, doubtless they have echoed o'er the arsenal,"
14563,ACT I.,"Keeping due time with every hammer's clink,"
14564,ACT I.,As a good jest to jolly artisans;
14565,ACT I.,"Or making chorus to the creaking oar,"
14566,ACT I.,"In the vile tune of every galley-slave,"
14567,ACT I.,"Who, as he sung the merry stave, exulted"
14568,ACT I.,_He_ was not a shamed dotard like the Doge.
14569,ACT I.,
14570,ACT I.,_I. Ber_. Is't possible? a month's imprisonment!
14571,ACT I.,No more for Steno?
14572,ACT I.,
14573,ACT I.,"_Doge_.           You have heard the offence,"
14574,ACT I.,And now you know his punishment; and then                          400
14575,ACT I.,"You ask redress of _me_! Go to the Forty,"
14576,ACT I.,Who passed the sentence upon Michel Steno;
14577,ACT I.,"They'll do as much by Barbaro, no doubt."
14578,ACT I.,
14579,ACT I.,_I. Ber_. Ah! dared I speak my feelings!
14580,ACT I.,
14581,ACT I.,_Doge_.                                 Give them breath.
14582,ACT I.,Mine have no further outrage to endure.
14583,ACT I.,
14584,ACT I.,"_I. Ber_. Then, in a word, it rests but on your word"
14585,ACT I.,To punish and avenge--I will not say
14586,ACT I.,"_My_ petty wrong, for what is a mere blow,"
14587,ACT I.,"However vile, to such a thing as I am?--"
14588,ACT I.,But the base insult done your state and person.                    410
14589,ACT I.,
14590,ACT I.,"_Doge_. You overrate my power, which is a pageant."
14591,ACT I.,This Cap is not the Monarch's crown; these robes
14592,ACT I.,"Might move compassion, like a beggar's rags;"
14593,ACT I.,"Nay, more, a beggar's are his own, and these"
14594,ACT I.,"But lent to the poor puppet, who must play"
14595,ACT I.,Its part with all its empire in this ermine.
14596,ACT I.,
14597,ACT I.,_I. Ber_. Wouldst thou be King?
14598,ACT I.,
14599,ACT I.,_Doge_.                        Yes--of a happy people.
14600,ACT I.,
14601,ACT I.,_I. Ber_. Wouldst thou be sovereign lord of Venice?
14602,ACT I.,
14603,ACT I.,"_Doge_.                                            Aye,"
14604,ACT I.,"If that the people shared that sovereignty,"
14605,ACT I.,So that nor they nor I were further slaves                         420
14606,ACT I.,"To this o'ergrown aristocratic Hydra,[394]"
14607,ACT I.,The poisonous heads of whose envenomed body
14608,ACT I.,Have breathed a pestilence upon us all.
14609,ACT I.,
14610,ACT I.,"_I. Ber_. Yet, thou wast born, and still hast lived, patrician."
14611,ACT I.,
14612,ACT I.,_Doge_. In evil hour was I so born; my birth
14613,ACT I.,Hath made me Doge to be insulted: but
14614,ACT I.,I lived and toiled a soldier and a servant
14615,ACT I.,"Of Venice and her people, not the Senate;"
14616,ACT I.,Their good and my own honour were my guerdon.
14617,ACT I.,"I have fought and bled; commanded, aye, and conquered;             430"
14618,ACT I.,"Have made and marred peace oft in embassies,"
14619,ACT I.,As it might chance to be our country's 'vantage;
14620,ACT I.,"Have traversed land and sea in constant duty,"
14621,ACT I.,"Through almost sixty years, and still for Venice,"
14622,ACT I.,"My fathers' and my birthplace, whose dear spires,"
14623,ACT I.,"Rising at distance o'er the blue Lagoon,"
14624,ACT I.,It was reward enough for me to view
14625,ACT I.,"Once more; but not for any knot of men,"
14626,ACT I.,"Nor sect, nor faction, did I bleed or sweat!"
14627,ACT I.,But would you know why I have done all this?                       440
14628,ACT I.,Ask of the bleeding pelican why she
14629,ACT I.,"Hath ripped her bosom? Had the bird a voice,"
14630,ACT I.,She'd tell thee 'twas for _all_ her little ones.
14631,ACT I.,
14632,ACT I.,_I. Ber_. And yet they made thee Duke.
14633,ACT I.,
14634,ACT I.,_Doge_.                           _They made_ me so;
14635,ACT I.,"I sought it not, the flattering fetters met me"
14636,ACT I.,"Returning from my Roman embassy,"
14637,ACT I.,And never having hitherto refused
14638,ACT I.,"Toil, charge, or duty for the state, I did not,"
14639,ACT I.,"At these late years, decline what was the highest"
14640,ACT I.,"Of all in seeming, but of all most base                            450"
14641,ACT I.,In what we have to do and to endure:
14642,ACT I.,"Bear witness for me thou, my injured subject,"
14643,ACT I.,When I can neither right myself nor thee.
14644,ACT I.,
14645,ACT I.,"_I. Ber_. You shall do both, if you possess the will;"
14646,ACT I.,"And many thousands more not less oppressed,"
14647,ACT I.,Who wait but for a signal--will you give it?
14648,ACT I.,
14649,ACT I.,_Doge_. You speak in riddles.
14650,ACT I.,
14651,ACT I.,_I. Ber_.                     Which shall soon be read
14652,ACT I.,At peril of my life--if you disdain not
14653,ACT I.,To lend a patient ear.
14654,ACT I.,
14655,ACT I.,_Doge_.               Say on.
14656,ACT I.,
14657,ACT I.,"_I. Ber_.                       Not thou,"
14658,ACT I.,"Nor I alone, are injured and abused,                               460"
14659,ACT I.,Contemned and trampled on; but the whole people
14660,ACT I.,Groan with the strong conception of their wrongs:
14661,ACT I.,The foreign soldiers in the Senate's pay
14662,ACT I.,Are discontented for their long arrears;
14663,ACT I.,"The native mariners, and civic troops,"
14664,ACT I.,Feel with their friends; for who is he amongst them
14665,ACT I.,"Whose brethren, parents, children, wives, or sisters,"
14666,ACT I.,"Have not partook[395] oppression, or pollution,"
14667,ACT I.,From the patricians? And the hopeless war
14668,ACT I.,"Against the Genoese, which is still maintained                     470"
14669,ACT I.,"With the plebeian blood, and treasure wrung"
14670,ACT I.,"From their hard earnings, has inflamed them further:"
14671,ACT I.,"Even now--but, I forget that speaking thus,"
14672,ACT I.,Perhaps I pass the sentence of my death!
14673,ACT I.,
14674,ACT I.,_Doge_. And suffering what thou hast done--fear'st thou death?
14675,ACT I.,"Be silent then, and live on, to be beaten"
14676,ACT I.,By those for whom thou hast bled.
14677,ACT I.,
14678,ACT I.,"_I. Ber_.                       No, I will speak"
14679,ACT I.,At every hazard; and if Venice' Doge
14680,ACT I.,"Should turn delator, be the shame on him,"
14681,ACT I.,And sorrow too; for he will lose far more                          480
14682,ACT I.,Than I.
14683,ACT I.,
14684,ACT I.,_Doge_. From me fear nothing; out with it!
14685,ACT I.,
14686,ACT I.,"_I. Ber_. Know then, that there are met and sworn in secret"
14687,ACT I.,"A band of brethren, valiant hearts and true;"
14688,ACT I.,"Men who have proved all fortunes, and have long"
14689,ACT I.,"Grieved over that of Venice, and have right"
14690,ACT I.,"To do so; having served her in all climes,"
14691,ACT I.,"And having rescued her from foreign foes,"
14692,ACT I.,Would do the same from those within her walls.
14693,ACT I.,"They are not numerous, nor yet too few"
14694,ACT I.,"For their great purpose; they have arms, and means,                490"
14695,ACT I.,"And hearts, and hopes, and faith, and patient courage."
14696,ACT I.,
14697,ACT I.,_Doge_. For what then do they pause?
14698,ACT I.,
14699,ACT I.,_I. Ber_.                           An hour to strike.
14700,ACT I.,
14701,ACT I.,_Doge_ (_aside_). Saint Mark's shall strike that hour![396]
14702,ACT I.,
14703,ACT I.,_I. Ber_.                                    I now have placed
14704,ACT I.,"My life, my honour, all my earthly hopes"
14705,ACT I.,"Within thy power, but in the firm belief"
14706,ACT I.,"That injuries like ours, sprung from one cause,"
14707,ACT I.,"Will generate one vengeance: should it be so,"
14708,ACT I.,Be our Chief now--our Sovereign hereafter.
14709,ACT I.,
14710,ACT I.,_Doge_. How many are ye?
14711,ACT I.,
14712,ACT I.,_I. Ber_.               I'll not answer that
14713,ACT I.,Till I am answered.
14714,ACT I.,
14715,ACT I.,"_Doge_.            How, sir! do you menace?                        500"
14716,ACT I.,
14717,ACT I.,_I. Ber_. No; I affirm. I have betrayed myself;
14718,ACT I.,But there's no torture in the mystic wells
14719,ACT I.,"Which undermine your palace, nor in those"
14720,ACT I.,"Not less appalling cells, the ""leaden roofs,"""
14721,ACT I.,To force a single name from me of others.
14722,ACT I.,The Pozzi[397] and the Piombi were in vain;
14723,ACT I.,"They might wring blood from me, but treachery never."
14724,ACT I.,"And I would pass the fearful ""Bridge of Sighs,"""
14725,ACT I.,Joyous that mine must be the last that e'er
14726,ACT I.,Would echo o'er the Stygian wave which flows                       510
14727,ACT I.,"Between the murderers and the murdered, washing"
14728,ACT I.,The prison and the palace walls: there are
14729,ACT I.,"Those who would live to think on't, and avenge me."
14730,ACT I.,
14731,ACT I.,"_Doge_. If such your power and purpose, why come here"
14732,ACT I.,"To sue for justice, being in the course"
14733,ACT I.,To do yourself due right?
14734,ACT I.,
14735,ACT I.,"_I. Ber_.                 Because the man,"
14736,ACT I.,"Who claims protection from authority,"
14737,ACT I.,Showing his confidence and his submission
14738,ACT I.,"To that authority, can hardly be"
14739,ACT I.,Suspected of combining to destroy it.                              520
14740,ACT I.,"Had I sate down too humbly with this blow,"
14741,ACT I.,A moody brow and muttered threats had made me
14742,ACT I.,A marked man to the Forty's inquisition;
14743,ACT I.,"But loud complaint, however angrily"
14744,ACT I.,"It shapes its phrase, is little to be feared,"
14745,ACT I.,"And less distrusted. But, besides all this,"
14746,ACT I.,I had another reason.
14747,ACT I.,
14748,ACT I.,_Doge_.              What was that?
14749,ACT I.,
14750,ACT I.,_I. Ber_. Some rumours that the Doge was greatly moved
14751,ACT I.,By the reference of the Avogadori
14752,ACT I.,Of Michel Steno's sentence to the Forty                            530
14753,ACT I.,"Had reached me. I had served you, honoured you,"
14754,ACT I.,"And felt that you were dangerously insulted,"
14755,ACT I.,"Being of an order of such spirits, as"
14756,ACT I.,Requite tenfold both good and evil: 'twas
14757,ACT I.,My wish to prove and urge you to redress.
14758,ACT I.,"Now you know all; and that I speak the truth,"
14759,ACT I.,My peril be the proof.
14760,ACT I.,
14761,ACT I.,_Doge_.                 You have deeply ventured;
14762,ACT I.,But all must do so who would greatly win:
14763,ACT I.,Thus far I'll answer you--your secret's safe.
14764,ACT I.,
14765,ACT I.,_I. Ber_. And is this all?
14766,ACT I.,
14767,ACT I.,"_Doge_.                   Unless with all intrusted,               540"
14768,ACT I.,What would you have me answer?
14769,ACT I.,
14770,ACT I.,_I. Ber_.                     I would have you
14771,ACT I.,Trust him who leaves his life in trust with you.
14772,ACT I.,
14773,ACT I.,"_Doge_. But I must know your plan, your names, and numbers;"
14774,ACT I.,"The last may then be doubled, and the former"
14775,ACT I.,Matured and strengthened.
14776,ACT I.,
14777,ACT I.,_I. Ber_.                We're enough already;
14778,ACT I.,You are the sole ally we covet now.
14779,ACT I.,
14780,ACT I.,_Doge_. But bring me to the knowledge of your chiefs.
14781,ACT I.,
14782,ACT I.,_I. Ber_. That shall be done upon your formal pledge
14783,ACT I.,To keep the faith that we will pledge to you.
14784,ACT I.,
14785,ACT I.,_Doge_. When? where?
14786,ACT I.,
14787,ACT I.,_I. Ber_.           This night I'll bring to your apartment        550
14788,ACT I.,Two of the principals: a greater number
14789,ACT I.,Were hazardous.
14790,ACT I.,
14791,ACT I.,"_Doge_.        Stay, I must think of this.--"
14792,ACT I.,"What if I were to trust myself amongst you,"
14793,ACT I.,And leave the palace?
14794,ACT I.,
14795,ACT I.,_I. Ber_.            You must come alone.
14796,ACT I.,
14797,ACT I.,_Doge_. With but my nephew.
14798,ACT I.,
14799,ACT I.,_I. Ber_.                  Not were he your son!
14800,ACT I.,
14801,ACT I.,_Doge_. Wretch! darest thou name my son? He died in arms
14802,ACT I.,At Sapienza[398] for this faithless state.
14803,ACT I.,"Oh! that he were alive, and I in ashes!"
14804,ACT I.,Or that he were alive ere I be ashes!
14805,ACT I.,I should not need the dubious aid of strangers.                    560
14806,ACT I.,
14807,ACT I.,"_I. Ber_. Not one of all those strangers whom thou doubtest,"
14808,ACT I.,"But will regard thee with a filial feeling,"
14809,ACT I.,So that thou keep'st a father's faith with them.
14810,ACT I.,
14811,ACT I.,_Doge_. The die is cast. Where is the place of meeting?
14812,ACT I.,
14813,ACT I.,_I. Ber_. At midnight I will be alone and masked
14814,ACT I.,"Where'er your Highness pleases to direct me,"
14815,ACT I.,"To wait your coming, and conduct you where"
14816,ACT I.,"You shall receive our homage, and pronounce"
14817,ACT I.,Upon our project.
14818,ACT I.,
14819,ACT I.,_Doge_.           At what hour arises
14820,ACT I.,The moon?
14821,ACT I.,
14822,ACT I.,"_I. Ber_.  Late, but the atmosphere is thick and dusky,          570"
14823,ACT I.,'Tis a sirocco.
14824,ACT I.,
14825,ACT I.,"_Doge_.           At the midnight hour, then,"
14826,ACT I.,"Near to the church where sleep my sires;[399] the same,"
14827,ACT I.,Twin-named from the apostles John and Paul;
14828,ACT I.,"A gondola,[400] with one oar only, will"
14829,ACT I.,Lurk in the narrow channel which glides by.
14830,ACT I.,Be there.
14831,ACT I.,
14832,ACT I.,_I. Ber_. I will not fail.
14833,ACT I.,
14834,ACT I.,_Doge_.                     And now retire----
14835,ACT I.,
14836,ACT I.,_I. Ber_. In the full hope your Highness will not falter
14837,ACT I.,"In your great purpose. Prince, I take my leave."
14838,ACT I.,[_Exit_ Isreal Bertuccio.
14839,ACT I.,
14840,ACT I.,"_Doge_ (_solus_). At midnight, by the church Saints John and Paul,"
14841,ACT I.,"Where sleep my noble fathers, I repair--                           580"
14842,ACT I.,To what? to hold a council in the dark
14843,ACT I.,With common ruffians leagued to ruin states!
14844,ACT I.,"And will not my great sires leap from the vault,"
14845,ACT I.,"Where lie two Doges who preceded me,"
14846,ACT I.,And pluck me down amongst them? Would they could!
14847,ACT I.,For I should rest in honour with the honoured.
14848,ACT I.,"Alas! I must not think of them, but those"
14849,ACT I.,Who have made me thus unworthy of a name
14850,ACT I.,Noble and brave as aught of consular
14851,ACT I.,On Roman marbles; but I will redeem it                             590
14852,ACT I.,"Back to its antique lustre in our annals,"
14853,ACT I.,"By sweet revenge on all that's base in Venice,"
14854,ACT I.,"And freedom to the rest, or leave it black"
14855,ACT I.,"To all the growing calumnies of Time,"
14856,ACT I.,"Which never spare the fame of him who fails,"
14857,ACT I.,"But try the Cæsar, or the Catiline,"
14858,ACT I.,By the true touchstone of desert--Success.[401]
14859,ACT I.,
14860,ACT I.,
14861,ACT I.,
14862,ACT I.,
14863,ACT II.,ACT II.
14864,ACT II.,
14865,ACT II.,
14866,ACT II.,SCENE I.--_An Apartment in the Ducal Palace_.
14867,ACT II.,
14868,ACT II.,ANGIOLINA[402] (_wife of the_ DOGE) _and_ MARIANNA.
14869,ACT II.,
14870,ACT II.,_Ang_. What was the Doge's answer?
14871,ACT II.,
14872,ACT II.,_Mar_.                            That he was
14873,ACT II.,That moment summoned to a conference;
14874,ACT II.,But 'tis by this time ended. I perceived
14875,ACT II.,Not long ago the Senators embarking;
14876,ACT II.,And the last gondola may now be seen
14877,ACT II.,Gliding into the throng of barks which stud
14878,ACT II.,The glittering waters.
14879,ACT II.,
14880,ACT II.,_Ang_.                Would he were returned!
14881,ACT II.,He has been much disquieted of late;
14882,ACT II.,"And Time, which has not tamed his fiery spirit,"
14883,ACT II.,"Nor yet enfeebled even his mortal frame,                            10"
14884,ACT II.,Which seems to be more nourished by a soul
14885,ACT II.,So quick and restless that it would consume
14886,ACT II.,Less hardy clay--Time has but little power
14887,ACT II.,On his resentments or his griefs. Unlike
14888,ACT II.,"To other spirits of his order, who,"
14889,ACT II.,"In the first burst of passion, pour away"
14890,ACT II.,"Their wrath or sorrow, all things wear in him"
14891,ACT II.,"An aspect of Eternity: his thoughts,"
14892,ACT II.,"His feelings, passions, good or evil, all"
14893,ACT II.,Have nothing of old age;[403] and his bold brow                     20
14894,ACT II.,"Bears but the scars of mind, the thoughts of years,"
14895,ACT II.,Not their decrepitude: and he of late
14896,ACT II.,Has been more agitated than his wont.
14897,ACT II.,Would he were come! for I alone have power
14898,ACT II.,Upon his troubled spirit.
14899,ACT II.,
14900,ACT II.,"_Mar_.                    It is true,"
14901,ACT II.,His Highness has of late been greatly moved
14902,ACT II.,"By the affront of Steno, and with cause:"
14903,ACT II.,But the offender doubtless even now
14904,ACT II.,Is doomed to expiate his rash insult with
14905,ACT II.,Such chastisement as will enforce respect                           30
14906,ACT II.,"To female virtue, and to noble blood."
14907,ACT II.,
14908,ACT II.,_Ang_. 'Twas a gross insult; but I heed it not
14909,ACT II.,"For the rash scorner's falsehood in itself,"
14910,ACT II.,"But for the effect, the deadly deep impression"
14911,ACT II.,"Which it has made upon Faliero's soul,"
14912,ACT II.,"The proud, the fiery, the austere--austere"
14913,ACT II.,To all save me: I tremble when I think
14914,ACT II.,To what it may conduct.
14915,ACT II.,
14916,ACT II.,_Mar_.                  Assuredly
14917,ACT II.,The Doge can not suspect you?
14918,ACT II.,
14919,ACT II.,_Ang_.                        Suspect _me!_
14920,ACT II.,"Why Steno dared not: when he scrawled his lie,                      40"
14921,ACT II.,"Grovelling by stealth in the moon's glimmering light,"
14922,ACT II.,"His own still conscience smote him for the act,"
14923,ACT II.,And every shadow on the walls frowned shame
14924,ACT II.,Upon his coward calumny.
14925,ACT II.,
14926,ACT II.,_Mar_.                   'Twere fit
14927,ACT II.,He should be punished grievously.
14928,ACT II.,
14929,ACT II.,_Ang_.                            He is so.
14930,ACT II.,
14931,ACT II.,_Mar_. What! is the sentence passed? is he condemned?[de]
14932,ACT II.,
14933,ACT II.,"_Ang_. I know not that, but he has been detected."
14934,ACT II.,
14935,ACT II.,_Mar_. And deem you this enough for such foul scorn?
14936,ACT II.,
14937,ACT II.,"_Ang_. I would not be a judge in my own cause,"
14938,ACT II.,Nor do I know what sense of punishment                              50
14939,ACT II.,May reach the soul of ribalds such as Steno;
14940,ACT II.,But if his insults sink no deeper in
14941,ACT II.,The minds of the inquisitors than they
14942,ACT II.,"Have ruffled mine, he will, for all acquittance,"
14943,ACT II.,Be left to his own shamelessness or shame.
14944,ACT II.,
14945,ACT II.,_Mar_. Some sacrifice is due to slandered virtue.
14946,ACT II.,
14947,ACT II.,"_Ang_. Why, what is virtue if it needs a victim?"
14948,ACT II.,Or if it must depend upon men's words?
14949,ACT II.,"The dying Roman said, ""'twas but a name:""[404]"
14950,ACT II.,"It were indeed no more, if human breath                             60"
14951,ACT II.,Could make or mar it.
14952,ACT II.,
14953,ACT II.,"_Mar_.                Yet full many a dame,"
14954,ACT II.,"Stainless and faithful, would feel all the wrong"
14955,ACT II.,"Of such a slander; and less rigid ladies,"
14956,ACT II.,"Such as abound in Venice, would be loud"
14957,ACT II.,And all-inexorable in their cry
14958,ACT II.,For justice.
14959,ACT II.,
14960,ACT II.,_Ang_.       This but proves it is the name
14961,ACT II.,And not the quality they prize: the first
14962,ACT II.,"Have found it a hard task to hold their honour,"
14963,ACT II.,If they require it to be blazoned forth;
14964,ACT II.,"And those who have not kept it, seek its seeming                    70"
14965,ACT II.,As they would look out for an ornament
14966,ACT II.,"Of which they feel the want, but not because"
14967,ACT II.,"They think it so; they live in others' thoughts,"
14968,ACT II.,And would seem honest as they must seem fair.
14969,ACT II.,
14970,ACT II.,_Mar_. You have strange thoughts for a patrician dame.
14971,ACT II.,
14972,ACT II.,"_Ang_. And yet they were my father's; with his name,"
14973,ACT II.,The sole inheritance he left.
14974,ACT II.,
14975,ACT II.,_Mar_.                        You want none;
14976,ACT II.,"Wife to a Prince, the Chief of the Republic."
14977,ACT II.,
14978,ACT II.,"_Ang_. I should have sought none though a peasant's bride,"
14979,ACT II.,But feel not less the love and gratitude                            80
14980,ACT II.,"Due to my father, who bestowed my hand"
14981,ACT II.,"Upon his early, tried, and trusted friend,"
14982,ACT II.,"The Count Val di Marino, now our Doge."
14983,ACT II.,
14984,ACT II.,_Mar_. And with that hand did he bestow your heart?
14985,ACT II.,
14986,ACT II.,"_Ang_. He did so, or it had not been bestowed."
14987,ACT II.,
14988,ACT II.,"_Mar_. Yet this strange disproportion in your years,"
14989,ACT II.,"And, let me add, disparity of tempers,"
14990,ACT II.,Might make the world doubt whether such an union
14991,ACT II.,"Could make you wisely, permanently happy."
14992,ACT II.,
14993,ACT II.,_Ang_. The world will think with worldlings; but my heart           90
14994,ACT II.,"Has still been in my duties, which are many,"
14995,ACT II.,But never difficult.
14996,ACT II.,
14997,ACT II.,_Mar_.               And do you love him?
14998,ACT II.,
14999,ACT II.,_Ang_. I love all noble qualities which merit
15000,ACT II.,"Love, and I loved my father, who first taught me"
15001,ACT II.,"To single out what we should love in others,"
15002,ACT II.,And to subdue all tendency to lend
15003,ACT II.,The best and purest feelings of our nature
15004,ACT II.,To baser passions. He bestowed my hand
15005,ACT II.,"Upon Faliero: he had known him noble,"
15006,ACT II.,"Brave, generous; rich in all the qualities                         100"
15007,ACT II.,"Of soldier, citizen, and friend; in all"
15008,ACT II.,Such have I found him as my father said.
15009,ACT II.,His faults are those that dwell in the high bosoms
15010,ACT II.,"Of men who have commanded; too much pride,"
15011,ACT II.,And the deep passions fiercely fostered by
15012,ACT II.,"The uses of patricians, and a life"
15013,ACT II.,Spent in the storms of state and war; and also
15014,ACT II.,"From the quick sense of honour, which becomes"
15015,ACT II.,"A duty to a certain sign, a vice"
15016,ACT II.,"When overstrained, and this I fear in him.                         110"
15017,ACT II.,"And then he has been rash from his youth upwards,"
15018,ACT II.,Yet tempered by redeeming nobleness
15019,ACT II.,"In such sort, that the wariest of republics"
15020,ACT II.,"Has lavished all its chief employs upon him,"
15021,ACT II.,"From his first fight to his last embassy,"
15022,ACT II.,From which on his return the Dukedom met him.
15023,ACT II.,
15024,ACT II.,"_Mar_. But previous to this marriage, had your heart"
15025,ACT II.,"Ne'er beat for any of the noble youth,"
15026,ACT II.,Such as in years had been more meet to match
15027,ACT II.,"Beauty like yours? or, since, have you ne'er seen                  120"
15028,ACT II.,"One, who, if your fair hand were still to give,"
15029,ACT II.,Might now pretend to Loredano's daughter?
15030,ACT II.,
15031,ACT II.,_Ang_. I answered your first question when I said
15032,ACT II.,I married.
15033,ACT II.,
15034,ACT II.,_Mar_.      And the second?
15035,ACT II.,
15036,ACT II.,_Ang_.                     Needs no answer.
15037,ACT II.,
15038,ACT II.,"_Mar_. I pray you pardon, if I have offended."
15039,ACT II.,
15040,ACT II.,"_Ang_. I feel no wrath, but some surprise: I knew not"
15041,ACT II.,That wedded bosoms could permit themselves
15042,ACT II.,"To ponder upon what they _now_ might choose,"
15043,ACT II.,Or aught save their past choice.
15044,ACT II.,
15045,ACT II.,_Mar_.                           'Tis their past choice
15046,ACT II.,That far too often makes them deem they would                      130
15047,ACT II.,"Now choose more wisely, could they cancel it."
15048,ACT II.,
15049,ACT II.,_Ang_. It may be so. I knew not of such thoughts.
15050,ACT II.,
15051,ACT II.,_Mar_. Here comes the Doge--shall I retire?
15052,ACT II.,
15053,ACT II.,_Ang_.                                      It may
15054,ACT II.,Be better you should quit me; he seems rapt
15055,ACT II.,In thought.--How pensively he takes his way!
15056,ACT II.,[_Exit_ MARIANNA.
15057,ACT II.,
15058,ACT II.,_Enter the_ DOGE _and_ PIETRO.
15059,ACT II.,
15060,ACT II.,_Doge_ (_musing_). There is a certain Philip Calendaro
15061,ACT II.,"Now in the Arsenal, who holds command"
15062,ACT II.,"Of eighty men, and has great influence"
15063,ACT II.,Besides on all the spirits of his comrades:
15064,ACT II.,"This man, I hear, is bold and popular,                             140"
15065,ACT II.,"Sudden and daring, and yet secret; 'twould"
15066,ACT II.,Be well that he were won: I needs must hope
15067,ACT II.,"That Israel Bertuccio has secured him,"
15068,ACT II.,But fain would be----
15069,ACT II.,
15070,ACT II.,"_Pie_.               My Lord, pray pardon me"
15071,ACT II.,For breaking in upon your meditation;
15072,ACT II.,"The Senator Bertuccio, your kinsman,"
15073,ACT II.,Charged me to follow and enquire your pleasure
15074,ACT II.,To fix an hour when he may speak with you.
15075,ACT II.,
15076,ACT II.,_Doge_. At sunset.--Stay a moment--let me see--
15077,ACT II.,Say in the second hour of night.                       [_Exit_ PIETRO.
15078,ACT II.,
15079,ACT II.,_Ang_.                           My Lord!                          150
15080,ACT II.,
15081,ACT II.,"_Doge_. My dearest child, forgive me--why delay"
15082,ACT II.,So long approaching me?--I saw you not.
15083,ACT II.,
15084,ACT II.,"_Ang_. You were absorbed in thought, and he who now"
15085,ACT II.,Has parted from you might have words of weight
15086,ACT II.,To bear you from the Senate.
15087,ACT II.,
15088,ACT II.,_Doge_.                     From the Senate?
15089,ACT II.,
15090,ACT II.,_Ang_. I would not interrupt him in his duty
15091,ACT II.,And theirs.
15092,ACT II.,
15093,ACT II.,_Doge_.    The Senate's duty! you mistake;
15094,ACT II.,'Tis we who owe all service to the Senate.
15095,ACT II.,
15096,ACT II.,_Ang_. I thought the Duke had held command in Venice.
15097,ACT II.,
15098,ACT II.,_Doge_. He shall.--But let that pass.--We will be jocund.          160
15099,ACT II.,How fares it with you? have you been abroad?
15100,ACT II.,"The day is overcast, but the calm wave"
15101,ACT II.,Favours the gondolier's light skimming oar;
15102,ACT II.,Or have you held a levee of your friends?
15103,ACT II.,Or has your music made you solitary?
15104,ACT II.,Say--is there aught that you would will within
15105,ACT II.,The little sway now left the Duke? or aught
15106,ACT II.,"Of fitting splendour, or of honest pleasure,"
15107,ACT II.,"Social or lonely, that would glad your heart,"
15108,ACT II.,"To compensate for many a dull hour, wasted                         170"
15109,ACT II.,On an old man oft moved with many cares?
15110,ACT II.,"Speak, and 'tis done."
15111,ACT II.,
15112,ACT II.,_Ang_.               You're ever kind to me.
15113,ACT II.,"I have nothing to desire, or to request,"
15114,ACT II.,Except to see you oftener and calmer.
15115,ACT II.,
15116,ACT II.,_Doge_. Calmer?
15117,ACT II.,
15118,ACT II.,"_Ang_.         Aye, calmer, my good Lord.--Ah, why"
15119,ACT II.,"Do you still keep apart, and walk alone,"
15120,ACT II.,"And let such strong emotions stamp your brow,"
15121,ACT II.,"As not betraying their full import, yet"
15122,ACT II.,Disclose too much?
15123,ACT II.,
15124,ACT II.,_Doge_.            Disclose too much!--of what?
15125,ACT II.,What is there to disclose?
15126,ACT II.,
15127,ACT II.,_Ang_.                    A heart so ill                           180
15128,ACT II.,At ease.
15129,ACT II.,
15130,ACT II.,"_Doge_.    'Tis nothing, child.--But in the state"
15131,ACT II.,You know what daily cares oppress all those
15132,ACT II.,Who govern this precarious commonwealth;
15133,ACT II.,"Now suffering from the Genoese without,"
15134,ACT II.,And malcontents within--'tis this which makes me
15135,ACT II.,More pensive and less tranquil than my wont.
15136,ACT II.,
15137,ACT II.,"_Ang_. Yet this existed long before, and never"
15138,ACT II.,Till in these late days did I see you thus.
15139,ACT II.,Forgive me; there is something at your heart
15140,ACT II.,"More than the mere discharge of public duties,                     190"
15141,ACT II.,Which long use and a talent like to yours
15142,ACT II.,"Have rendered light, nay, a necessity,"
15143,ACT II.,To keep your mind from stagnating. 'Tis not
15144,ACT II.,"In hostile states, nor perils, thus to shake you,--"
15145,ACT II.,"You, who have stood all storms and never sunk,"
15146,ACT II.,And climbed up to the pinnacle of power
15147,ACT II.,"And never fainted by the way, and stand"
15148,ACT II.,"Upon it, and can look down steadily"
15149,ACT II.,"Along the depth beneath, and ne'er feel dizzy."
15150,ACT II.,"Were Genoa's galleys riding in the port,                           200"
15151,ACT II.,"Were civil fury raging in Saint Mark's,"
15152,ACT II.,"You are not to be wrought on, but would fall,"
15153,ACT II.,"As you have risen, with an unaltered brow:"
15154,ACT II.,Your feelings now are of a different kind;
15155,ACT II.,"Something has stung your pride, not patriotism."
15156,ACT II.,
15157,ACT II.,_Doge_. Pride! Angiolina? Alas! none is left me.
15158,ACT II.,
15159,ACT II.,"_Ang_. Yes--the same sin that overthrew the angels,"
15160,ACT II.,And of all sins most easily besets
15161,ACT II.,Mortals the nearest to the angelic nature:
15162,ACT II.,The vile are only vain; the great are proud.                       210
15163,ACT II.,
15164,ACT II.,"_Doge_. I _had_ the pride of honour, of _your_ honour,"
15165,ACT II.,Deep at my heart--But let us change the theme.
15166,ACT II.,
15167,ACT II.,_Ang_. Ah no!--As I have ever shared your kindness
15168,ACT II.,"In all things else, let me not be shut out"
15169,ACT II.,"From your distress: were it of public import,"
15170,ACT II.,"You know I never sought, would never seek"
15171,ACT II.,To win a word from you; but feeling now
15172,ACT II.,"Your grief is private, it belongs to me"
15173,ACT II.,To lighten or divide it. Since the day
15174,ACT II.,When foolish Steno's ribaldry detected                             220
15175,ACT II.,"Unfixed your quiet, you are greatly changed,"
15176,ACT II.,And I would soothe you back to what you were.
15177,ACT II.,
15178,ACT II.,_Doge_. To what I was!--have you heard Steno's sentence?
15179,ACT II.,
15180,ACT II.,_Ang_. No.
15181,ACT II.,
15182,ACT II.,_Doge_.     A month's arrest.
15183,ACT II.,
15184,ACT II.,_Ang_.                        Is it not enough?
15185,ACT II.,
15186,ACT II.,"_Doge_. Enough!--yes, for a drunken galley slave,"
15187,ACT II.,"Who, stung by stripes, may murmur at his master;"
15188,ACT II.,"But not for a deliberate, false, cool villain,"
15189,ACT II.,Who stains a Lady's and a Prince's honour
15190,ACT II.,Even on the throne of his authority.
15191,ACT II.,
15192,ACT II.,_Ang_. There seems to be enough in the conviction                  230
15193,ACT II.,Of a patrician guilty of a falsehood:
15194,ACT II.,All other punishment were light unto
15195,ACT II.,His loss of honour.
15196,ACT II.,
15197,ACT II.,_Doge_.             Such men have no honour;
15198,ACT II.,They have but their vile lives--and these are spared.
15199,ACT II.,
15200,ACT II.,_Ang_. You would not have him die for this offence?
15201,ACT II.,
15202,ACT II.,"_Doge_. Not _now_:--being still alive, I'd have him live"
15203,ACT II.,Long as _he_ can; he has ceased to merit death;
15204,ACT II.,"The guilty saved hath damned his hundred judges,"
15205,ACT II.,"And he is pure, for now his crime is theirs."
15206,ACT II.,
15207,ACT II.,_Ang_. Oh! had this false and flippant libeller                    240
15208,ACT II.,"Shed his young blood for his absurd lampoon,"
15209,ACT II.,Ne'er from that moment could this breast have known
15210,ACT II.,"A joyous hour, or dreamless slumber more."
15211,ACT II.,
15212,ACT II.,_Doge_. Does not the law of Heaven say blood for blood?
15213,ACT II.,And he who _taints_ kills more than he who sheds it.
15214,ACT II.,"Is it the _pain_ of blows, or _shame_ of blows,"
15215,ACT II.,That makes such deadly to the sense of man?
15216,ACT II.,"Do not the laws of man say blood for honour,--"
15217,ACT II.,"And, less than honour, for a little gold?"
15218,ACT II.,Say not the laws of nations blood for treason?                     250
15219,ACT II.,Is't nothing to have filled these veins with poison
15220,ACT II.,For their once healthful current? is it nothing
15221,ACT II.,To have stained your name and mine--the noblest names?
15222,ACT II.,Is't nothing to have brought into contempt
15223,ACT II.,A Prince before his people? to have failed
15224,ACT II.,In the respect accorded by Mankind
15225,ACT II.,"To youth in woman, and old age in man?"
15226,ACT II.,"To virtue in your sex, and dignity"
15227,ACT II.,In ours?--But let them look to it who have saved him.
15228,ACT II.,
15229,ACT II.,_Ang_. Heaven bids us to forgive our enemies.                      260
15230,ACT II.,
15231,ACT II.,_Doge_. Doth Heaven forgive her own? Is there not Hell
15232,ACT II.,For wrath eternal?[df][405]
15233,ACT II.,
15234,ACT II.,_Ang_.                  Do not speak thus wildly--[dg]
15235,ACT II.,Heaven will alike forgive you and your foes.
15236,ACT II.,
15237,ACT II.,_Doge_. Amen! May Heaven forgive them!
15238,ACT II.,
15239,ACT II.,_Ang_.                                And will you?
15240,ACT II.,
15241,ACT II.,"_Doge_. Yes, when they are in Heaven!"
15242,ACT II.,
15243,ACT II.,_Ang_.                                And not till then?
15244,ACT II.,
15245,ACT II.,"_Doge_. What matters my forgiveness? an old man's,"
15246,ACT II.,"Worn out, scorned, spurned, abused; what matters then"
15247,ACT II.,"My pardon more than my resentment, both"
15248,ACT II.,Being weak and worthless? I have lived too long;
15249,ACT II.,But let us change the argument.--My child!                         270
15250,ACT II.,"My injured wife, the child of Loredano,"
15251,ACT II.,"The brave, the chivalrous, how little deemed"
15252,ACT II.,"Thy father, wedding thee unto his friend,"
15253,ACT II.,That he was linking thee to shame!--Alas!
15254,ACT II.,"Shame without sin, for thou art faultless. Hadst thou"
15255,ACT II.,"But had a different husband, _any_ husband"
15256,ACT II.,"In Venice save the Doge, this blight, this brand,"
15257,ACT II.,This blasphemy had never fallen upon thee.
15258,ACT II.,"So young, so beautiful, so good, so pure,"
15259,ACT II.,"To suffer this, and yet be unavenged!                              280"
15260,ACT II.,
15261,ACT II.,"_Ang_. I am too well avenged, for you still love me,"
15262,ACT II.,"And trust, and honour me; and all men know"
15263,ACT II.,"That you are just, and I am true: what more"
15264,ACT II.,"Could I require, or you command?"
15265,ACT II.,
15266,ACT II.,"_Doge_.                          'Tis well,"
15267,ACT II.,"And may be better; but whate'er betide,"
15268,ACT II.,Be thou at least kind to my memory.
15269,ACT II.,
15270,ACT II.,_Ang_. Why speak you thus?
15271,ACT II.,
15272,ACT II.,_Doge_.                    It is no matter why;
15273,ACT II.,"But I would still, whatever others think,"
15274,ACT II.,Have your respect both now and in my grave.
15275,ACT II.,
15276,ACT II.,_Ang_. Why should you doubt it? has it ever failed?                290
15277,ACT II.,
15278,ACT II.,"_Doge_. Come hither, child! I would a word with you."
15279,ACT II.,Your father was my friend; unequal Fortune
15280,ACT II.,Made him my debtor for some courtesies
15281,ACT II.,"Which bind the good more firmly: when, oppressed"
15282,ACT II.,"With his last malady, he willed our union,"
15283,ACT II.,"It was not to repay me, long repaid"
15284,ACT II.,Before by his great loyalty in friendship;
15285,ACT II.,His object was to place your orphan beauty
15286,ACT II.,"In honourable safety from the perils,"
15287,ACT II.,"Which, in this scorpion nest of vice, assail                       300"
15288,ACT II.,A lonely and undowered maid. I did not
15289,ACT II.,"Think with him, but would not oppose the thought"
15290,ACT II.,Which soothed his death-bed.
15291,ACT II.,
15292,ACT II.,_Ang_.                       I have not forgotten
15293,ACT II.,The nobleness with which you bade me speak
15294,ACT II.,If my young heart held any preference
15295,ACT II.,Which would have made me happier; nor your offer
15296,ACT II.,To make my dowry equal to the rank
15297,ACT II.,"Of aught in Venice, and forego all claim"
15298,ACT II.,My father's last injunction gave you.
15299,ACT II.,
15300,ACT II.,"_Doge_.                               Thus,"
15301,ACT II.,"'Twas not a foolish dotard's vile caprice,                         310"
15302,ACT II.,"Nor the false edge of agéd appetite,"
15303,ACT II.,"Which made me covetous of girlish beauty,"
15304,ACT II.,And a young bride: for in my fieriest youth
15305,ACT II.,I swayed such passions; nor was this my age
15306,ACT II.,Infected with that leprosy of lust[406]
15307,ACT II.,"Which taints the hoariest years of vicious men,"
15308,ACT II.,Making them ransack to the very last
15309,ACT II.,The dregs of pleasure for their vanished joys;
15310,ACT II.,"Or buy in selfish marriage some young victim,"
15311,ACT II.,"Too helpless to refuse a state that's honest,                      320"
15312,ACT II.,Too feeling not to know herself a wretch.
15313,ACT II.,Our wedlock was not of this sort; you had
15314,ACT II.,"Freedom from me to choose, and urged in answer"
15315,ACT II.,Your father's choice.
15316,ACT II.,
15317,ACT II.,_Ang_.               I did so; I would do so
15318,ACT II.,In face of earth and Heaven; for I have never
15319,ACT II.,"Repented for my sake; sometimes for yours,"
15320,ACT II.,In pondering o'er your late disquietudes.
15321,ACT II.,
15322,ACT II.,_Doge_. I knew my heart would never treat you harshly:
15323,ACT II.,I knew my days could not disturb you long;
15324,ACT II.,"And then the daughter of my earliest friend,                       330"
15325,ACT II.,"His worthy daughter, free to choose again."
15326,ACT II.,"Wealthier and wiser, in the ripest bloom"
15327,ACT II.,"Of womanhood, more skilful to select"
15328,ACT II.,"By passing these probationary years,"
15329,ACT II.,"Inheriting a Prince's name and riches,"
15330,ACT II.,"Secured, by the short penance of enduring"
15331,ACT II.,"An old man for some summers, against all"
15332,ACT II.,That law's chicane or envious kinsmen might
15333,ACT II.,Have urged against her right; my best friend's child
15334,ACT II.,"Would choose more fitly in respect of years,                       340"
15335,ACT II.,And not less truly in a faithful heart.
15336,ACT II.,
15337,ACT II.,"_Ang_. My Lord, I looked but to my father's wishes,"
15338,ACT II.,"Hallowed by his last words, and to my heart"
15339,ACT II.,"For doing all its duties, and replying"
15340,ACT II.,With faith to him with whom I was affianced.
15341,ACT II.,Ambitious hopes ne'er crossed my dreams; and should
15342,ACT II.,"The hour you speak of come, it will be seen so."
15343,ACT II.,
15344,ACT II.,_Doge_. I do believe you; and I know you true:
15345,ACT II.,For Love--romantic Love--which in my youth
15346,ACT II.,"I knew to be illusion, and ne'er saw                               350"
15347,ACT II.,"Lasting, but often fatal, it had been"
15348,ACT II.,"No lure for me, in my most passionate days,"
15349,ACT II.,"And could not be so now, did such exist."
15350,ACT II.,"But such respect, and mildly paid regard"
15351,ACT II.,"As a true feeling for your welfare, and"
15352,ACT II.,"A free compliance with all honest wishes,--"
15353,ACT II.,"A kindness to your virtues, watchfulness"
15354,ACT II.,"Not shown, but shadowing o'er such little failings"
15355,ACT II.,"As Youth is apt in, so as not to check"
15356,ACT II.,"Rashly, but win you from them ere you knew                         360"
15357,ACT II.,"You had been won, but thought the change your choice;"
15358,ACT II.,"A pride not in your beauty, but your conduct;"
15359,ACT II.,"A trust in you; a patriarchal love,"
15360,ACT II.,"And not a doting homage; friendship, faith,--"
15361,ACT II.,Such estimation in your eyes as these
15362,ACT II.,"Might claim, I hoped for."
15363,ACT II.,
15364,ACT II.,_Ang_.                   And have ever had.
15365,ACT II.,
15366,ACT II.,_Doge_. I think so. For the difference in our years
15367,ACT II.,"You knew it choosing me, and chose; I trusted"
15368,ACT II.,"Not to my qualities, nor would have faith"
15369,ACT II.,"In such, nor outward ornaments of nature,                          370"
15370,ACT II.,Were I still in my five and twentieth spring;
15371,ACT II.,I trusted to the blood of Loredano[407]
15372,ACT II.,Pure in your veins; I trusted to the soul
15373,ACT II.,God gave you--to the truths your father taught you--
15374,ACT II.,To your belief in Heaven--to your mild virtues--
15375,ACT II.,"To your own faith and honour, for my own."
15376,ACT II.,
15377,ACT II.,"_Ang_. You have done well.--I thank you for that trust,"
15378,ACT II.,Which I have never for one moment ceased
15379,ACT II.,To honour you the more for.
15380,ACT II.,
15381,ACT II.,"_Doge_.                      Where is Honour,"
15382,ACT II.,"Innate and precept-strengthened, 'tis the rock                     380"
15383,ACT II.,Of faith connubial: where it is not--where
15384,ACT II.,"Light thoughts are lurking, or the vanities"
15385,ACT II.,"Of worldly pleasure rankle in the heart,"
15386,ACT II.,"Or sensual throbs convulse it, well I know"
15387,ACT II.,'Twere hopeless for humanity to dream
15388,ACT II.,"Of honesty in such infected blood,"
15389,ACT II.,Although 'twere wed to him it covets most:
15390,ACT II.,An incarnation of the poet's God
15391,ACT II.,"In all his marble-chiselled beauty, or"
15392,ACT II.,"The demi-deity, Alcides, in                                        390"
15393,ACT II.,"His majesty of superhuman Manhood,"
15394,ACT II.,Would not suffice to bind where virtue is not;
15395,ACT II.,It is consistency which forms and proves it:
15396,ACT II.,"Vice cannot fix, and Virtue cannot change."
15397,ACT II.,The once fall'n woman must for ever fall;
15398,ACT II.,"For Vice must have variety, while Virtue"
15399,ACT II.,"Stands like the Sun, and all which rolls around"
15400,ACT II.,"Drinks life, and light, and glory from her aspect."
15401,ACT II.,
15402,ACT II.,"_Ang_. And seeing, feeling thus this truth in others,"
15403,ACT II.,(I pray you pardon me;) but wherefore yield you                    400
15404,ACT II.,"To the most fierce of fatal passions, and"
15405,ACT II.,Disquiet your great thoughts with restless hate
15406,ACT II.,Of such a thing as Steno?
15407,ACT II.,
15408,ACT II.,_Doge_.                  You mistake me.
15409,ACT II.,It is not Steno who could move me thus;
15410,ACT II.,"Had it been so, he should--but let that pass."
15411,ACT II.,
15412,ACT II.,"_Ang_. What is't you feel so deeply, then, even now?"
15413,ACT II.,
15414,ACT II.,"_Doge_. The violated majesty of Venice,"
15415,ACT II.,At once insulted in her Lord and laws.
15416,ACT II.,
15417,ACT II.,_Ang_. Alas! why will you thus consider it?
15418,ACT II.,
15419,ACT II.,_Doge_. I have thought on't till--but let me lead you back         410
15420,ACT II.,"To what I urged; all these things being noted,"
15421,ACT II.,I wedded you; the world then did me justice
15422,ACT II.,"Upon the motive, and my conduct proved"
15423,ACT II.,"They did me right, while yours was all to praise:"
15424,ACT II.,You had all freedom--all respect--all trust
15425,ACT II.,"From me and mine; and, born of those who made"
15426,ACT II.,"Princes at home, and swept Kings from their thrones"
15427,ACT II.,"On foreign shores, in all things you appeared"
15428,ACT II.,Worthy to be our first of native dames.
15429,ACT II.,
15430,ACT II.,_Ang_. To what does this conduct?
15431,ACT II.,
15432,ACT II.,_Doge_.                           To thus much--that               420
15433,ACT II.,A miscreant's angry breath may blast it all--
15434,ACT II.,"A villain, whom for his unbridled bearing,"
15435,ACT II.,"Even in the midst of our great festival,"
15436,ACT II.,"I caused to be conducted forth, and taught"
15437,ACT II.,How to demean himself in ducal chambers;
15438,ACT II.,A wretch like this may leave upon the wall
15439,ACT II.,"The blighting venom of his sweltering heart,"
15440,ACT II.,And this shall spread itself in general poison;
15441,ACT II.,"And woman's innocence, man's honour, pass"
15442,ACT II.,Into a by-word; and the doubly felon                               430
15443,ACT II.,(Who first insulted virgin modesty
15444,ACT II.,By a gross affront to your attendant damsels
15445,ACT II.,Amidst the noblest of our dames in public)
15446,ACT II.,Requite himself for his most just expulsion
15447,ACT II.,"By blackening publicly his Sovereign's consort,"
15448,ACT II.,And be absolved by his upright compeers.
15449,ACT II.,
15450,ACT II.,_Ang_. But he has been condemned into captivity.
15451,ACT II.,
15452,ACT II.,_Doge_. For such as him a dungeon were acquittal;
15453,ACT II.,And his brief term of mock-arrest will pass
15454,ACT II.,Within a palace. But I've done with him;                           440
15455,ACT II.,The rest must be with you.
15456,ACT II.,
15457,ACT II.,"_Ang_.                     With me, my Lord?"
15458,ACT II.,
15459,ACT II.,"_Doge_. Yes, Angiolina. Do not marvel; I"
15460,ACT II.,Have let this prey upon me till I feel
15461,ACT II.,My life cannot be long; and fain would have you
15462,ACT II.,Regard the injunctions you will find within
15463,ACT II.,This scroll (_giving her a paper_)
15464,ACT II.,----Fear not; they are for your advantage:
15465,ACT II.,Read them hereafter at the fitting hour.
15466,ACT II.,
15467,ACT II.,"_Ang_. My Lord, in life, and after life, you shall"
15468,ACT II.,Be honoured still by me: but may your days
15469,ACT II.,Be many yet--and happier than the present!                         450
15470,ACT II.,"This passion will give way, and you will be"
15471,ACT II.,"Serene, and what you should be--what you were."
15472,ACT II.,
15473,ACT II.,"_Doge_. I will be what I should be, or be nothing;"
15474,ACT II.,"But never more--oh! never, never more,"
15475,ACT II.,O'er the few days or hours which yet await
15476,ACT II.,"The blighted old age of Faliero, shall"
15477,ACT II.,Sweet Quiet shed her sunset! Never more
15478,ACT II.,Those summer shadows rising from the past
15479,ACT II.,"Of a not ill-spent nor inglorious life,"
15480,ACT II.,"Mellowing the last hours as the night approaches,                  460"
15481,ACT II.,Shall soothe me to my moment of long rest.
15482,ACT II.,"I had but little more to ask, or hope,"
15483,ACT II.,"Save the regards due to the blood and sweat,"
15484,ACT II.,And the soul's labour through which I had toiled
15485,ACT II.,To make my country honoured. As her servant--
15486,ACT II.,"Her servant, though her chief--I would have gone"
15487,ACT II.,Down to my fathers with a name serene
15488,ACT II.,And pure as theirs; but this has been denied me.
15489,ACT II.,Would I had died at Zara!
15490,ACT II.,
15491,ACT II.,_Ang_.                   There you saved
15492,ACT II.,"The state; then live to save her still. A day,                     470"
15493,ACT II.,Another day like that would be the best
15494,ACT II.,"Reproof to them, and sole revenge for you."
15495,ACT II.,
15496,ACT II.,_Doge_. But one such day occurs within an age;
15497,ACT II.,"My life is little less than one, and 'tis"
15498,ACT II.,"Enough for Fortune to have granted _once_,"
15499,ACT II.,That which scarce one more favoured citizen
15500,ACT II.,May win in many states and years. But why
15501,ACT II.,Thus speak I? Venice has forgot that day--
15502,ACT II.,"Then why should I remember it?--Farewell,"
15503,ACT II.,Sweet Angiolina! I must to my cabinet;                             480
15504,ACT II.,There's much for me to do--and the hour hastens.[408]
15505,ACT II.,
15506,ACT II.,_Ang_. Remember what you were.
15507,ACT II.,
15508,ACT II.,_Doge_.                        It were in vain!
15509,ACT II.,"Joy's recollection is no longer joy,"
15510,ACT II.,While Sorrow's memory is a sorrow still.
15511,ACT II.,
15512,ACT II.,"_Ang_. At least, whate'er may urge, let me implore"
15513,ACT II.,That you will take some little pause of rest:
15514,ACT II.,"Your sleep for many nights has been so turbid,"
15515,ACT II.,"That it had been relief to have awaked you,"
15516,ACT II.,Had I not hoped that Nature would o'erpower
15517,ACT II.,At length the thoughts which shook your slumbers thus.             490
15518,ACT II.,An hour of rest will give you to your toils
15519,ACT II.,With fitter thoughts and freshened strength.
15520,ACT II.,
15521,ACT II.,_Doge_.                                      I cannot--
15522,ACT II.,"I must not, if I could; for never was"
15523,ACT II.,Such reason to be watchful: yet a few--
15524,ACT II.,"Yet a few days and dream-perturbéd nights,"
15525,ACT II.,And I shall slumber well--but where?--no matter.
15526,ACT II.,"Adieu, my Angiolina."
15527,ACT II.,
15528,ACT II.,_Ang_.                 Let me be
15529,ACT II.,An instant--yet an instant your companion!
15530,ACT II.,I cannot bear to leave you thus.
15531,ACT II.,
15532,ACT II.,"_Doge_.                          Come then,"
15533,ACT II.,My gentle child--forgive me: thou wert made                        500
15534,ACT II.,"For better fortunes than to share in mine,"
15535,ACT II.,Now darkling in their close toward the deep vale
15536,ACT II.,Where Death sits robed in his all-sweeping shadow.[dh]
15537,ACT II.,When I am gone--it may be sooner than
15538,ACT II.,"Even these years warrant, for there is that stirring"
15539,ACT II.,"Within--above--around, that in this city"
15540,ACT II.,Will make the cemeteries populous
15541,ACT II.,"As e'er they were by pestilence or war,--"
15542,ACT II.,"When I _am_ nothing, let that which I _was_"
15543,ACT II.,"Be still sometimes a name on thy sweet lips,                       510"
15544,ACT II.,"A shadow in thy fancy, of a thing"
15545,ACT II.,"Which would not have thee mourn it, but remember."
15546,ACT II.,"Let us begone, my child--the time is pressing."
15547,ACT II.,
15548,ACT II.,
15549,ACT II.,SCENE II.--_A retired spot near the Arsenal_.
15550,ACT II.,
15551,ACT II.,ISRAEL BERTUCCIO _and_ PHILIP CALENDARO.[409]
15552,ACT II.,
15553,ACT II.,"_Cal_. How sped you, Israel, in your late complaint?"
15554,ACT II.,
15555,ACT II.,"_I. Ber_. Why, well."
15556,ACT II.,
15557,ACT II.,_Cal_.               Is't possible! will he be punished?
15558,ACT II.,
15559,ACT II.,_I. Ber_.                                                Yes.
15560,ACT II.,
15561,ACT II.,_Cal_. With what? a mulct or an arrest?
15562,ACT II.,
15563,ACT II.,_I. Ber_.                                With death!
15564,ACT II.,
15565,ACT II.,"_Cal_. Now you rave, or must intend revenge,"
15566,ACT II.,"Such as I counselled you, with your own hand."
15567,ACT II.,
15568,ACT II.,"_I. Ber_. Yes; and for one sole draught of hate, forego"
15569,ACT II.,"The great redress we meditate for Venice,"
15570,ACT II.,And change a life of hope for one of exile;
15571,ACT II.,"Leaving one scorpion crushed, and thousands stinging"
15572,ACT II.,"My friends, my family, my countrymen!                               10"
15573,ACT II.,"No, Calendaro; these same drops of blood,"
15574,ACT II.,"Shed shamefully, shall have the whole of his"
15575,ACT II.,For their requital----But not only his;
15576,ACT II.,We will not strike for private wrongs alone:
15577,ACT II.,"Such are for selfish passions and rash men,"
15578,ACT II.,But are unworthy a Tyrannicide.
15579,ACT II.,
15580,ACT II.,_Cal_. You have more patience than I care to boast.
15581,ACT II.,"Had I been present when you bore this insult,"
15582,ACT II.,"I must have slain him, or expired myself"
15583,ACT II.,In the vain effort to repress my wrath.                             20
15584,ACT II.,
15585,ACT II.,_I. Ber_. Thank Heaven you were not--all had else been marred:
15586,ACT II.,"As 'tis, our cause looks prosperous still."
15587,ACT II.,
15588,ACT II.,_Cal_.                                    You saw
15589,ACT II.,The Doge--what answer gave he?
15590,ACT II.,
15591,ACT II.,_I. Ber_.                     That there was
15592,ACT II.,No punishment for such as Barbaro.
15593,ACT II.,
15594,ACT II.,"_Cal_. I told you so before, and that 'twas idle"
15595,ACT II.,To think of justice from such hands.
15596,ACT II.,
15597,ACT II.,"_I. Ber_.                           At least,"
15598,ACT II.,"It lulled suspicion, showing confidence."
15599,ACT II.,"Had I been silent, not a Sbirro[410] but"
15600,ACT II.,"Had kept me in his eye, as meditating"
15601,ACT II.,"A silent, solitary, deep revenge.                                   30"
15602,ACT II.,
15603,ACT II.,_Cal_. But wherefore not address you to the Council?
15604,ACT II.,"The Doge is a mere puppet, who can scarce"
15605,ACT II.,Obtain right for himself. Why speak to _him_?
15606,ACT II.,
15607,ACT II.,_I. Ber_. You shall know that hereafter.
15608,ACT II.,
15609,ACT II.,_Cal_.                                   Why not now?
15610,ACT II.,
15611,ACT II.,"_I. Ber_. Be patient but till midnight. Get your musters,"
15612,ACT II.,And bid our friends prepare their companies:
15613,ACT II.,"Set all in readiness to strike the blow,"
15614,ACT II.,Perhaps in a few hours: we have long waited
15615,ACT II.,"For a fit time--that hour is on the dial,"
15616,ACT II.,"It may be, of to-morrow's sun: delay                                40"
15617,ACT II.,Beyond may breed us double danger. See
15618,ACT II.,"That all be punctual at our place of meeting,"
15619,ACT II.,"And armed, excepting those of the Sixteen,[411]"
15620,ACT II.,Who will remain among the troops to wait
15621,ACT II.,The signal.
15622,ACT II.,
15623,ACT II.,_Cal_.      These brave words have breathed new life
15624,ACT II.,Into my veins; I am sick of these protracted
15625,ACT II.,And hesitating councils: day on day
15626,ACT II.,"Crawled on, and added but another link"
15627,ACT II.,"To our long fetters, and some fresher wrong"
15628,ACT II.,"Inflicted on our brethren or ourselves,                             50"
15629,ACT II.,Helping to swell our tyrants' bloated strength.
15630,ACT II.,"Let us but deal upon them, and I care not"
15631,ACT II.,"For the result, which must be Death or Freedom!"
15632,ACT II.,I'm weary to the heart of finding neither.
15633,ACT II.,
15634,ACT II.,_I. Ber_. We will be free in Life or Death! the grave
15635,ACT II.,Is chainless. Have you all the musters ready?
15636,ACT II.,And are the sixteen companies completed
15637,ACT II.,To sixty?
15638,ACT II.,
15639,ACT II.,"_Cal_.    All save two, in which there are"
15640,ACT II.,Twenty-five wanting to make up the number.
15641,ACT II.,
15642,ACT II.,_I. Ber_. No matter; we can do without. Whose are they?             60
15643,ACT II.,
15644,ACT II.,"_Cal_. Bertram's[412] and old Soranzo's, both of whom"
15645,ACT II.,Appear less forward in the cause than we are.
15646,ACT II.,
15647,ACT II.,_I. Ber_. Your fiery nature makes you deem all those
15648,ACT II.,Who are not restless cold; but there exists
15649,ACT II.,Oft in concentred spirits not less daring
15650,ACT II.,Than in more loud avengers. Do not doubt them.
15651,ACT II.,
15652,ACT II.,_Cat_. I do not doubt the elder; but in Bertram
15653,ACT II.,"There is a hesitating softness, fatal"
15654,ACT II.,To enterprise like ours: I've seen that man
15655,ACT II.,Weep like an infant o'er the misery                                 70
15656,ACT II.,"Of others, heedless of his own, though greater;"
15657,ACT II.,And in a recent quarrel I beheld him
15658,ACT II.,"Turn sick at sight of blood, although a villain's."
15659,ACT II.,
15660,ACT II.,"_I. Ber_. The truly brave are soft of heart and eyes,"
15661,ACT II.,And feel for what their duty bids them do.
15662,ACT II.,I have known Bertram long; there doth not breathe
15663,ACT II.,A soul more full of honour.
15664,ACT II.,
15665,ACT II.,_Cal_.                       It may be so:
15666,ACT II.,I apprehend less treachery than weakness;
15667,ACT II.,"Yet as he has no mistress, and no wife"
15668,ACT II.,"To work upon his milkiness of spirit,                               80"
15669,ACT II.,He may go through the ordeal; it is well
15670,ACT II.,"He is an orphan, friendless save in us:"
15671,ACT II.,A woman or a child had made him less
15672,ACT II.,Than either in resolve.
15673,ACT II.,
15674,ACT II.,_I. Ber_.                Such ties are not
15675,ACT II.,For those who are called to the high destinies
15676,ACT II.,Which purify corrupted commonwealths;
15677,ACT II.,"We must forget all feelings save the _one_,"
15678,ACT II.,"We must resign all passions save our purpose,"
15679,ACT II.,"We must behold no object save our country,"
15680,ACT II.,"And only look on Death as beautiful,                                90"
15681,ACT II.,"So that the sacrifice ascend to Heaven,"
15682,ACT II.,And draw down Freedom on her evermore.
15683,ACT II.,
15684,ACT II.,_Cal_. But if we fail----[413]
15685,ACT II.,
15686,ACT II.,_I. Ber_.                They never fail who die
15687,ACT II.,In a great cause: the block may soak their gore:[di]
15688,ACT II.,Their heads may sodden in the sun; their limbs
15689,ACT II.,Be strung to city gates and castle walls--
15690,ACT II.,But still their Spirit walks abroad. Though years
15691,ACT II.,"Elapse, and others share as dark a doom,"
15692,ACT II.,They but augment the deep and sweeping thoughts
15693,ACT II.,"Which overpower all others, and conduct                            100"
15694,ACT II.,"The world at last to Freedom. What were we,"
15695,ACT II.,If Brutus had not lived? He died in giving[dj]
15696,ACT II.,"Rome liberty, but left a deathless lesson--"
15697,ACT II.,"A name which is a virtue, and a Soul"
15698,ACT II.,"Which multiplies itself throughout all time,"
15699,ACT II.,"When wicked men wax mighty, and a state"
15700,ACT II.,Turns servile. He and his high friend were styled
15701,ACT II.,"""The last of Romans!""[414] Let us be the first"
15702,ACT II.,"Of true Venetians, sprung from Roman sires."
15703,ACT II.,
15704,ACT II.,_Cal_. Our fathers did not fly from Attila[415]                    110
15705,ACT II.,"Into these isles, where palaces have sprung"
15706,ACT II.,"On banks redeemed from the rude ocean's ooze,"
15707,ACT II.,To own a thousand despots in his place.
15708,ACT II.,"Better bow down before the Hun, and call"
15709,ACT II.,"A Tartar lord, than these swoln silkworms[416] masters!"
15710,ACT II.,"The first at least was man, and used his sword"
15711,ACT II.,As sceptre: these unmanly creeping things
15712,ACT II.,"Command our swords, and rule us with a word"
15713,ACT II.,As with a spell.
15714,ACT II.,
15715,ACT II.,_I. Ber_.        It shall be broken soon.
15716,ACT II.,You say that all things are in readiness;                          120
15717,ACT II.,"To-day I have not been the usual round,"
15718,ACT II.,And why thou knowest; but thy vigilance
15719,ACT II.,Will better have supplied my care: these orders
15720,ACT II.,In recent council to redouble now
15721,ACT II.,"Our efforts to repair the galleys, have"
15722,ACT II.,Lent a fair colour to the introduction
15723,ACT II.,"Of many of our cause into the arsenal,"
15724,ACT II.,"As new artificers for their equipment,"
15725,ACT II.,Or fresh recruits obtained in haste to man
15726,ACT II.,The hoped-for fleet.--Are all supplied with arms?                  130
15727,ACT II.,
15728,ACT II.,_Cal_. All who were deemed trust-worthy: there are some
15729,ACT II.,Whom it were well to keep in ignorance
15730,ACT II.,"Till it be time to strike, and then supply them;"
15731,ACT II.,When in the heat and hurry of the hour
15732,ACT II.,"They have no opportunity to pause,"
15733,ACT II.,But needs must on with those who will surround them.
15734,ACT II.,
15735,ACT II.,_I. Ber_. You have said well. Have you remarked all such?
15736,ACT II.,
15737,ACT II.,_Cal_. I've noted most; and caused the other chiefs
15738,ACT II.,To use like caution in their companies.
15739,ACT II.,"As far as I have seen, we are enough                               140"
15740,ACT II.,"To make the enterprise secure, if 'tis"
15741,ACT II.,"Commenced to-morrow; but, till 'tis begun,"
15742,ACT II.,Each hour is pregnant with a thousand perils.
15743,ACT II.,
15744,ACT II.,"_I. Ber_. Let the Sixteen meet at the wonted hour,"
15745,ACT II.,"Except Soranzo, Nicoletto Blondo,"
15746,ACT II.,"And Marco Giuda, who will keep their watch"
15747,ACT II.,"Within the arsenal, and hold all ready,"
15748,ACT II.,Expectant of the signal we will fix on.
15749,ACT II.,
15750,ACT II.,_Cal_. We will not fail.
15751,ACT II.,
15752,ACT II.,_I. Ber_.                 Let all the rest be there;
15753,ACT II.,I have a stranger to present to them.                              150
15754,ACT II.,
15755,ACT II.,_Cal_. A stranger! doth he know the secret?
15756,ACT II.,
15757,ACT II.,_I. Ber_.                                   Yes.
15758,ACT II.,
15759,ACT II.,_Cal_. And have you dared to peril your friends' lives
15760,ACT II.,On a rash confidence in one we know not?
15761,ACT II.,
15762,ACT II.,_I. Ber_. I have risked no man's life except my own--
15763,ACT II.,Of that be certain: he is one who may
15764,ACT II.,"Make our assurance doubly sure, according[417]"
15765,ACT II.,"His aid; and if reluctant, he no less"
15766,ACT II.,"Is in our power: he comes alone with me,"
15767,ACT II.,And cannot 'scape us; but he will not swerve.
15768,ACT II.,
15769,ACT II.,_Cal_. I cannot judge of this until I know him:                    160
15770,ACT II.,Is he one of our order?
15771,ACT II.,
15772,ACT II.,"_I. Ber_.              Aye, in spirit,"
15773,ACT II.,Although a child of Greatness; he is one
15774,ACT II.,"Who would become a throne, or overthrow one--"
15775,ACT II.,"One who has done great deeds, and seen great changes;"
15776,ACT II.,"No tyrant, though bred up to tyranny;"
15777,ACT II.,"Valiant in war, and sage in council; noble"
15778,ACT II.,"In nature, although haughty; quick, yet wary:"
15779,ACT II.,"Yet for all this, so full of certain passions,"
15780,ACT II.,"That if once stirred and baffled, as he has been"
15781,ACT II.,"Upon the tenderest points, there is no Fury                        170"
15782,ACT II.,In Grecian story like to that which wrings
15783,ACT II.,"His vitals with her burning hands, till he"
15784,ACT II.,Grows capable of all things for revenge;
15785,ACT II.,"And add too, that his mind is liberal,"
15786,ACT II.,"He sees and feels the people are oppressed,"
15787,ACT II.,"And shares their sufferings. Take him all in all,"
15788,ACT II.,"We have need of such, and such have need of us."
15789,ACT II.,
15790,ACT II.,_Cal_. And what part would you have him take with us?
15791,ACT II.,
15792,ACT II.,"_I. Ber_. It may be, that of Chief."
15793,ACT II.,
15794,ACT II.,_Cal_.                              What! and resign
15795,ACT II.,Your own command as leader?
15796,ACT II.,
15797,ACT II.,_I. Ber_.                  Even so.                                180
15798,ACT II.,"My object is to make your cause end well,"
15799,ACT II.,"And not to push myself to power. Experience,"
15800,ACT II.,"Some skill, and your own choice, had marked me out"
15801,ACT II.,"To act in trust as your commander, till"
15802,ACT II.,Some worthier should appear: if I have found such
15803,ACT II.,"As you yourselves shall own more worthy, think you"
15804,ACT II.,"That I would hesitate from selfishness,"
15805,ACT II.,"And, covetous of brief authority,"
15806,ACT II.,"Stake our deep interest on my single thoughts,"
15807,ACT II.,Rather than yield to one above me in                               190
15808,ACT II.,"All leading qualities? No, Calendaro,"
15809,ACT II.,Know your friend better; but you all shall judge.
15810,ACT II.,Away! and let us meet at the fixed hour.
15811,ACT II.,"Be vigilant, and all will yet go well."
15812,ACT II.,
15813,ACT II.,"_Cal_. Worthy Bertuccio, I have known you ever"
15814,ACT II.,"Trusty and brave, with head and heart to plan"
15815,ACT II.,What I have still been prompt to execute.
15816,ACT II.,"For my own part, I seek no other Chief;"
15817,ACT II.,"What the rest will decide, I know not, but"
15818,ACT II.,"I am with YOU, as I have ever been,                                200"

15883,ACT III.,
15884,ACT III.,_I. Ber_. Who goes there?

15886,ACT III.,_Doge_.                  A friend to Venice.
15887,ACT III.,
15888,ACT III.,_I. Ber_.                                    'Tis he.
15889,ACT III.,"Welcome, my Lord,--you are before the time."
15890,ACT III.,
15891,ACT III.,_Doge_. I am ready to proceed to your assembly.                     50
15892,ACT III.,
15893,ACT III.,_I. Ber_. Have with you.--I am proud and pleased to see
15894,ACT III.,Such confident alacrity. Your doubts
15895,ACT III.,"Since our last meeting, then, are all dispelled?"
15896,ACT III.,
15897,ACT III.,_Doge_. Not so--but I have set my little left[419]
15898,ACT III.,Of life upon this cast: the die was thrown
15899,ACT III.,When I first listened to your treason.--Start not!
15900,ACT III.,_That_ is the word; I cannot shape my tongue
15901,ACT III.,"To syllable black deeds into smooth names,"
15902,ACT III.,Though I be wrought on to commit them. When
15903,ACT III.,"I heard you tempt your Sovereign, and forbore                       60"
15904,ACT III.,"To have you dragged to prison, I became"

15909,ACT III.,"I am no spy, and neither are we traitors."
15910,ACT III.,
15911,ACT III.,_Doge_. _We--We!_--no matter--you have earned the right

15914,ACT III.,"And flourishing, when we are in our graves,"
15915,ACT III.,"Conducts her generations to our tombs,                              70"

15918,ACT III.,"The consequence will sanctify the deed,"
15919,ACT III.,And we shall be like the two Bruti in

15921,ACT III.,"If we should fail, employing bloody means"
15922,ACT III.,"And secret plot, although to a good end,"
15923,ACT III.,"Still we are traitors, honest Israel;--thou"
15924,ACT III.,No less than he who was thy Sovereign

15926,ACT III.,
15927,ACT III.,"_I. Ber_. 'Tis not the moment to consider thus,"

15936,ACT III.,_Doge_.                         Put up;
15937,ACT III.,Here are no human witnesses: look there--
15938,ACT III.,What see you?
15939,ACT III.,
15940,ACT III.,_I. Ber_.    Only a tall warrior's statue[420]
15941,ACT III.,"Bestriding a proud steed, in the dim light"
15942,ACT III.,Of the dull moon.
15943,ACT III.,
15944,ACT III.,_Doge_.           That Warrior was the sire
15945,ACT III.,"Of my sire's fathers, and that statue was                           90"
15946,ACT III.,Decreed to him by the twice rescued city:--
15947,ACT III.,Think you that he looks down on us or no?
15948,ACT III.,
15949,ACT III.,"_I. Ber_. My Lord, these are mere fantasies; there are"
15950,ACT III.,No eyes in marble.
15951,ACT III.,
15952,ACT III.,_Doge_.       But there are in Death.
15953,ACT III.,"I tell thee, man, there is a spirit in"
15954,ACT III.,"Such things that acts and sees, unseen, though felt;"
15955,ACT III.,"And, if there be a spell to stir the dead,"
15956,ACT III.,'Tis in such deeds as we are now upon.
15957,ACT III.,Deem'st thou the souls of such a race as mine
15958,ACT III.,"Can rest, when he, their last descendant Chief,                    100"
15959,ACT III.,Stands plotting on the brink of their pure graves
15960,ACT III.,With stung plebeians?
15961,ACT III.,
15962,ACT III.,_I. Ber_.            It had been as well
15963,ACT III.,"To have pondered this before,--ere you embarked"
15964,ACT III.,In our great enterprise.--Do you repent?
15965,ACT III.,
15966,ACT III.,"_Doge_. No--but I _feel_, and shall do to the last."
15967,ACT III.,"I cannot quench a glorious life at once,"
15968,ACT III.,"Nor dwindle to the thing I now must be,[dm]"
15969,ACT III.,"And take men's lives by stealth, without some pause:"
15970,ACT III.,"Yet doubt me not; it is this very feeling,"
15971,ACT III.,"And knowing _what_ has wrung me to be thus,                        110"
15972,ACT III.,Which is your best security. There's not
15973,ACT III.,A roused mechanic in your busy plot[dn]
15974,ACT III.,"So wronged as I, so fall'n, so loudly called"
15975,ACT III.,To his redress: the very means I am forced
15976,ACT III.,"By these fell tyrants to adopt is such,"
15977,ACT III.,That I abhor them doubly for the deeds
15978,ACT III.,Which I must do to pay them back for theirs.
15979,ACT III.,
15980,ACT III.,_I. Ber_. Let us away--hark--the Hour strikes.
15981,ACT III.,
15982,ACT III.,_Doge_.                                        On--on--
15983,ACT III.,"It is our knell, or that of Venice.--On."

16847,ACT IV.,"And relatives, in the first burst of vengeance,"
16848,ACT IV.,Are things in Venice deadlier than the laws.
16849,ACT IV.,
16850,ACT IV.,"_Ber_. My Lord, I thank you; but----"
16851,ACT IV.,
16852,ACT IV.,_Lioni_.                              But what? You have not
16853,ACT IV.,Raised a rash hand against one of our order?                       150
16854,ACT IV.,If so--withdraw and fly--and own it not;[ek]
16855,ACT IV.,I would not slay--but then I must not save thee!
16856,ACT IV.,He who has shed patrician blood----
16857,ACT IV.,
16858,ACT IV.,_Ber_.                              I come
16859,ACT IV.,"To save patrician blood, and not to shed it!"
16860,ACT IV.,"And thereunto I must be speedy, for"
16861,ACT IV.,Each minute lost may lose a life; since Time
16862,ACT IV.,"Has changed his slow scythe for the two-edged sword,"
16863,ACT IV.,"And is about to take, instead of sand,"
16864,ACT IV.,The dust from sepulchres to fill his hour-glass!--
16865,ACT IV.,Go not _thou_ forth to-morrow!
16866,ACT IV.,
16867,ACT IV.,_Lioni_.                            Wherefore not?--               160
16868,ACT IV.,What means this menace?
16869,ACT IV.,
16870,ACT IV.,"_Ber_.                   Do not seek its meaning,"
16871,ACT IV.,"But do as I implore thee;--stir not forth,"
16872,ACT IV.,Whate'er be stirring; though the roar of crowds--
16873,ACT IV.,"The cry of women, and the shrieks of babes--"
16874,ACT IV.,The groans of men--the clash of arms--the sound
16875,ACT IV.,"Of rolling drum, shrill trump, and hollow bell,"
16876,ACT IV.,"Peal in one wide alarum l--Go not forth,"
16877,ACT IV.,"Until the Tocsin's silent, nor even then"
16878,ACT IV.,Till I return!
16879,ACT IV.,
16880,ACT IV.,"_Lioni_.        Again, what does this mean?"
16881,ACT IV.,
16882,ACT IV.,"_Ber_. Again, I tell thee, ask not; but by all                     170"
16883,ACT IV.,Thou holdest dear on earth or Heaven--by all
16884,ACT IV.,"The Souls of thy great fathers, and thy hope"
16885,ACT IV.,"To emulate them, and to leave behind"
16886,ACT IV.,Descendants worthy both of them and thee--
16887,ACT IV.,By all thou hast of blessed in hope or memory--
16888,ACT IV.,By all thou hast to fear here or hereafter--
16889,ACT IV.,"By all the good deeds thou hast done to me,"
16890,ACT IV.,"Good I would now repay with greater good,[el]"
16891,ACT IV.,"Remain within--trust to thy household gods,[em]"
16892,ACT IV.,"And to my word for safety, if thou dost,                           180"
16893,ACT IV.,"As I now counsel--but if not, thou art lost!"
16894,ACT IV.,
16895,ACT IV.,_Lioni_. I am indeed already lost in wonder;
16896,ACT IV.,Surely thou ravest! what have _I_ to dread?
16897,ACT IV.,"Who are my foes? or if there be such, _why_"
16898,ACT IV.,"Art _thou_ leagued with them?--_thou!_ or, if so leagued,"
16899,ACT IV.,"Why comest thou to tell me at this hour,"
16900,ACT IV.,And not before?
16901,ACT IV.,
16902,ACT IV.,_Ber_.          I cannot answer this.
16903,ACT IV.,Wilt thou go forth despite of this true warning?
16904,ACT IV.,
16905,ACT IV.,"_Lioni_. I was not born to shrink from idle threats,"
16906,ACT IV.,The cause of which I know not: at the hour                         190
16907,ACT IV.,"Of council, be it soon or late, I shall not"
16908,ACT IV.,Be found among the absent.
16909,ACT IV.,
16910,ACT IV.,_Ber_.                      Say not so!
16911,ACT IV.,"Once more, art thou determined to go forth?"
16912,ACT IV.,
16913,ACT IV.,_Lioni_. I am. Nor is there aught which shall impede me!
16914,ACT IV.,
16915,ACT IV.,"_Ber_. Then, Heaven have mercy on thy soul!--Farewell!"
16916,ACT IV.,[_Going_.
16917,ACT IV.,
16918,ACT IV.,_Lioni_. Stay--there is more in this than my own safety
16919,ACT IV.,Which makes me call thee back; we must not part thus:
16920,ACT IV.,"Bertram, I have known thee long."
16921,ACT IV.,
16922,ACT IV.,"_Ber_.                          From childhood, Signor,"
16923,ACT IV.,You have been my protector: in the days
16924,ACT IV.,"Of reckless infancy, when rank forgets,                            200"
16925,ACT IV.,"Or, rather, is not yet taught to remember"
16926,ACT IV.,"Its cold prerogative, we played together;"
16927,ACT IV.,"Our sports, our smiles, our tears, were mingled oft;"
16928,ACT IV.,"My father was your father's client, I"
16929,ACT IV.,His son's scarce less than foster-brother; years
16930,ACT IV.,"Saw us together--happy, heart-full hours!"
16931,ACT IV.,Oh God! the difference 'twixt those hours and this!
16932,ACT IV.,
16933,ACT IV.,"_Lioni_. Bertram, 'tis thou who hast forgotten them."
16934,ACT IV.,
16935,ACT IV.,"_Ber_. Nor now, nor ever; whatsoe'er betide,"
16936,ACT IV.,I would have saved you: when to Manhood's growth                   210
16937,ACT IV.,"We sprung, and you, devoted to the state,"
16938,ACT IV.,"As suits your station, the more humble Bertram"
16939,ACT IV.,"Was left unto the labours of the humble,"
16940,ACT IV.,Still you forsook me not; and if my fortunes
16941,ACT IV.,"Have not been towering, 'twas no fault of him"
16942,ACT IV.,"Who ofttimes rescued and supported me,"
16943,ACT IV.,"When struggling with the tides of Circumstance,"
16944,ACT IV.,Which bear away the weaker: noble blood
16945,ACT IV.,Ne'er mantled in a nobler heart than thine
16946,ACT IV.,"Has proved to me, the poor plebeian Bertram.                       220"
16947,ACT IV.,Would that thy fellow Senators were like thee!
16948,ACT IV.,
16949,ACT IV.,"_Lioni_. Why, what hast thou to say against the Senate?[en]"
16950,ACT IV.,
16951,ACT IV.,_Ber_. Nothing.
16952,ACT IV.,
16953,ACT IV.,_Lioni_.        I know that there are angry spirits
16954,ACT IV.,"And turbulent mutterers of stifled treason,"
16955,ACT IV.,"Who lurk in narrow places, and walk out"
16956,ACT IV.,Muffled to whisper curses to the night;
16957,ACT IV.,"Disbanded soldiers, discontented ruffians,"
16958,ACT IV.,And desperate libertines who brawl in taverns;
16959,ACT IV.,"_Thou_ herdest not with such: 'tis true, of late"
16960,ACT IV.,"I have lost sight of thee, but thou wert wont                      230"
16961,ACT IV.,"To lead a temperate life, and break thy bread"
16962,ACT IV.,"With honest mates, and bear a cheerful aspect."
16963,ACT IV.,What hath come to thee? in thy hollow eye
16964,ACT IV.,"And hueless cheek, and thine unquiet motions,"
16965,ACT IV.,Sorrow and Shame and Conscience seem at war
16966,ACT IV.,To waste thee.
16967,ACT IV.,
16968,ACT IV.,_Ber_.         Rather Shame and Sorrow light
16969,ACT IV.,On the accurséd tyranny which rides[eo]
16970,ACT IV.,"The very air in Venice, and makes men"
16971,ACT IV.,Madden as in the last hours of the plague
16972,ACT IV.,Which sweeps the soul deliriously from life!                       240
16973,ACT IV.,
16974,ACT IV.,"_Lioni_. Some villains have been tampering with thee, Bertram;"
16975,ACT IV.,"This is not thy old language, nor own thoughts;"
16976,ACT IV.,Some wretch has made thee drunk with disaffection:
16977,ACT IV.,But thou must not be lost so; thou _wert_ good
16978,ACT IV.,"And kind, and art not fit for such base acts"
16979,ACT IV.,As Vice and Villany would put thee to:
16980,ACT IV.,Confess--confide in me--thou know'st my nature.
16981,ACT IV.,"What is it thou and thine are bound to do,"
16982,ACT IV.,"Which should prevent thy friend, the only son"
16983,ACT IV.,"Of him who was a friend unto thy father,                           250"
16984,ACT IV.,So that our good-will is a heritage
16985,ACT IV.,We should bequeath to our posterity
16986,ACT IV.,"Such as ourselves received it, or augmented;"
16987,ACT IV.,"I say, what is it thou must do, that I"
16988,ACT IV.,"Should deem thee dangerous, and keep the house"
16989,ACT IV.,Like a sick girl?
16990,ACT IV.,
16991,ACT IV.,"_Ber_.           Nay, question me no further:"
16992,ACT IV.,I must be gone.----
16993,ACT IV.,
16994,ACT IV.,"_Lioni_.           And I be murdered!--say,"
16995,ACT IV.,"Was it not thus thou said'st, my gentle Bertram?"
16996,ACT IV.,
16997,ACT IV.,_Ber_. Who talks of murder? what said I of murder?
16998,ACT IV.,Tis false! I did not utter such a word.                            260
16999,ACT IV.,
17000,ACT IV.,"_Lioni_. Thou didst not; but from out thy wolfish eye,"
17001,ACT IV.,"So changed from what I knew it, there glares forth"
17002,ACT IV.,"The gladiator. If _my_ life's thine object,"
17003,ACT IV.,"Take it--I am unarmed,--and then away!"
17004,ACT IV.,I would not hold my breath on such a tenure[ep]
17005,ACT IV.,As the capricious mercy of such things
17006,ACT IV.,As thou and those who have set thee to thy task-work.
17007,ACT IV.,
17008,ACT IV.,"_Ber_. Sooner than spill thy blood, I peril mine;"
17009,ACT IV.,"Sooner than harm a hair of thine, I place"
17010,ACT IV.,"In jeopardy a thousand heads, and some                             270"
17011,ACT IV.,"As noble, nay, even nobler than thine own."
17012,ACT IV.,
17013,ACT IV.,"_Lioni_. Aye, is it even so? Excuse me, Bertram;"
17014,ACT IV.,I am not worthy to be singled out
17015,ACT IV.,From such exalted hecatombs--who are they
17016,ACT IV.,"That _are_ in danger, and that _make_ the danger?"
17017,ACT IV.,
17018,ACT IV.,"_Ber_. Venice, and all that she inherits, are"
17019,ACT IV.,"Divided like a house against itself,"
17020,ACT IV.,And so will perish ere to-morrow's twilight!
17021,ACT IV.,
17022,ACT IV.,"_Lioni_. More mysteries, and awful ones! But now,"
17023,ACT IV.,"Or thou, or I, or both, it may be, are                             280"
17024,ACT IV.,"Upon the verge of ruin; speak once out,"
17025,ACT IV.,And thou art safe and glorious: for 'tis more
17026,ACT IV.,"Glorious to save than slay, and slay i' the dark too--"
17027,ACT IV.,"Fie, Bertram! that was not a craft for thee!"
17028,ACT IV.,How would it look to see upon a spear
17029,ACT IV.,The head of him whose heart was open to thee!
17030,ACT IV.,Borne by thy hand before the shuddering people?
17031,ACT IV.,"And such may be my doom; for here I swear,"
17032,ACT IV.,Whate'er the peril or the penalty
17033,ACT IV.,"Of thy denunciation, I go forth,                                   290"
17034,ACT IV.,"Unless thou dost detail the cause, and show"
17035,ACT IV.,The consequence of all which led thee here!
17036,ACT IV.,
17037,ACT IV.,"_Ber_. Is there no way to save thee? minutes fly,"
17038,ACT IV.,"And thou art lost!--_thou_! my sole benefactor,"
17039,ACT IV.,The only being who was constant to me
17040,ACT IV.,"Through every change. Yet, make me not a traitor!"
17041,ACT IV.,Let me save thee--but spare my honour!
17042,ACT IV.,
17043,ACT IV.,_Lioni_.                              Where
17044,ACT IV.,Can lie the honour in a league of murder?
17045,ACT IV.,And who are traitors save unto the State?
17046,ACT IV.,
17047,ACT IV.,"_Ber_. A league is still a compact, and more binding               300"
17048,ACT IV.,In honest hearts when words must stand for law;
17049,ACT IV.,"And in my mind, there is no traitor like"
17050,ACT IV.,He whose domestic treason plants the poniard[435]
17051,ACT IV.,Within the breast which trusted to his truth.
17052,ACT IV.,Lioni. And who will strike the steel to mine?
17053,ACT IV.,
17054,ACT IV.,_Ber_.                                       Not I;
17055,ACT IV.,I could have wound my soul up to all things
17056,ACT IV.,Save this. _Thou_ must not die! and think how dear
17057,ACT IV.,"Thy life is, when I risk so many lives,"
17058,ACT IV.,"Nay, more, the Life of lives, the liberty"
17059,ACT IV.,"Of future generations, _not_ to be                                 310"
17060,ACT IV.,"The assassin thou miscall'st me:--once, once more"
17061,ACT IV.,"I do adjure thee, pass not o'er thy threshold!"
17062,ACT IV.,
17063,ACT IV.,_Lioni_. It is in vain--this moment I go forth.
17064,ACT IV.,
17065,ACT IV.,_Ber_. Then perish Venice rather than my friend!
17066,ACT IV.,I will disclose--ensnare--betray--destroy--
17067,ACT IV.,"Oh, what a villain I become for thee!"
17068,ACT IV.,
17069,ACT IV.,"_Lioni_. Say, rather thy friend's saviour and the State's!--"
17070,ACT IV.,"Speak--pause not--all rewards, all pledges for"
17071,ACT IV.,Thy safety and thy welfare; wealth such as
17072,ACT IV.,"The State accords her worthiest servants; nay,                     330"
17073,ACT IV.,"Nobility itself I guarantee thee,"
17074,ACT IV.,So that thou art sincere and penitent.
17075,ACT IV.,
17076,ACT IV.,_Ber_. I have thought again: it must not be--I love thee--
17077,ACT IV.,"Thou knowest it--that I stand here is the proof,"
17078,ACT IV.,Not least though last; but having done my duty
17079,ACT IV.,"By thee, I now must do it by my country!"
17080,ACT IV.,Farewell--we meet no more in life!--farewell!
17081,ACT IV.,
17082,ACT IV.,"_Lioni_. What, ho!--Antonio--Pedro--to the door!"
17083,ACT IV.,See that none pass--arrest this man!----
17084,ACT IV.,
17085,ACT IV.,"_Enter_ ANTONIO _and other armed Domestics, who seize_ BERTRAM."
17086,ACT IV.,
17087,ACT IV.,_Lioni_ (_continues_).              Take care
17088,ACT IV.,"He hath no harm; bring me my sword and cloak,                      330"
17089,ACT IV.,And man the gondola with four oars--quick--
17090,ACT IV.,[_Exit_ ANTONIO.
17091,ACT IV.,"We will unto Giovanni Gradenigo's,"
17092,ACT IV.,"And send for Marc Cornaro:--fear not, Bertram;"
17093,ACT IV.,"This needful violence is for thy safety,"
17094,ACT IV.,No less than for the general weal.
17095,ACT IV.,
17096,ACT IV.,_Ber_.                            Where wouldst thou
17097,ACT IV.,Bear me a prisoner?
17098,ACT IV.,
17099,ACT IV.,"_Lioni_.             Firstly to ""the Ten;"""
17100,ACT IV.,Next to the Doge.
17101,ACT IV.,
17102,ACT IV.,_Ber_.           To the Doge?
17103,ACT IV.,
17104,ACT IV.,_Lioni_.                           Assuredly:
17105,ACT IV.,Is he not Chief of the State?
17106,ACT IV.,
17107,ACT IV.,_Ber_.                        Perhaps at sunrise--
17108,ACT IV.,
17109,ACT IV.,_Lioni_. What mean you?--but we'll know anon.
17110,ACT IV.,
17111,ACT IV.,_Ber_.                                       Art sure?
17112,ACT IV.,
17113,ACT IV.,_Lioni_. Sure as all gentle means can make; and if                 340
17114,ACT IV.,"They fail, you know ""the Ten"" and their tribunal,"
17115,ACT IV.,"And that St. Mark's has dungeons, and the dungeons"
17116,ACT IV.,A rack.
17117,ACT IV.,
17118,ACT IV.,_Ber_.  Apply it then before the dawn
17119,ACT IV.,"Now hastening into heaven.--One more such word,"
17120,ACT IV.,"And you shall perish piecemeal, by the death"
17121,ACT IV.,You think to doom to me.
17122,ACT IV.,
17123,ACT IV.,_Re-enter_ ANTONIO.
17124,ACT IV.,
17125,ACT IV.,"_Ant_.                    The bark is ready,"
17126,ACT IV.,"My Lord, and all prepared."
17127,ACT IV.,
17128,ACT IV.,_Lioni_.                  Look to the prisoner.
17129,ACT IV.,"Bertram, I'll reason with thee as we go"
17130,ACT IV.,"To the Magnifico's, sage Gradenigo.                         [_Exeunt_."
17131,ACT IV.,
17132,ACT IV.,
17133,ACT IV.,SCENE II.--_The Ducal Palace_--_The Doge's Apartment_.
17134,ACT IV.,
17135,ACT IV.,_The_ DOGE _and his Nephew_ BERTUCCIO FALIERO.
17136,ACT IV.,
17137,ACT IV.,_Doge_. Are all the people of our house in muster?
17138,ACT IV.,
17139,ACT IV.,"_Ber. F._ They are arrayed, and eager for the signal,"
17140,ACT IV.,Within our palace precincts at San Polo:[436]
17141,ACT IV.,I come for your last orders.
17142,ACT IV.,
17143,ACT IV.,_Doge_.                     It had been
17144,ACT IV.,"As well had there been time to have got together,"
17145,ACT IV.,"From my own fief, Val di Marino, more"
17146,ACT IV.,Of our retainers--but it is too late.
17147,ACT IV.,
17148,ACT IV.,"_Ber. F._ Methinks, my Lord,'tis better as it is:"
17149,ACT IV.,A sudden swelling of our retinue
17150,ACT IV.,"Had waked suspicion; and, though fierce and trusty,                 10"
17151,ACT IV.,The vassals of that district are too rude
17152,ACT IV.,And quick in quarrel to have long maintained
17153,ACT IV.,The secret discipline we need for such
17154,ACT IV.,"A service, till our foes are dealt upon."
17155,ACT IV.,
17156,ACT IV.,"_Doge_. True; but when once the signal has been given,"
17157,ACT IV.,_These_ are the men for such an enterprise;
17158,ACT IV.,"These city slaves have all their private bias,"
17159,ACT IV.,"Their prejudice _against_ or _for_ this noble,"
17160,ACT IV.,Which may induce them to o'erdo or spare
17161,ACT IV.,"Where mercy may be madness; the fierce peasants,                    20"
17162,ACT IV.,"Serfs of my county of Val di Marino,"
17163,ACT IV.,Would do the bidding of their lord without
17164,ACT IV.,Distinguishing for love or hate his foes;
17165,ACT IV.,"Alike to them Marcello or Cornaro,"
17166,ACT IV.,A Gradenigo or a Foscari;[eq]
17167,ACT IV.,"They are not used to start at those vain names,"
17168,ACT IV.,Nor bow the knee before a civic Senate;
17169,ACT IV.,"A chief in armour is their Suzerain,"
17170,ACT IV.,And not a thing in robes.
17171,ACT IV.,
17172,ACT IV.,_Ber. F._                We are enough;
17173,ACT IV.,And for the dispositions of our clients                             30
17174,ACT IV.,Against the Senate I will answer.
17175,ACT IV.,
17176,ACT IV.,"_Doge_.                          Well,"
17177,ACT IV.,"The die is thrown; but for a warlike service,"
17178,ACT IV.,"Done in the field, commend me to my peasants:"
17179,ACT IV.,They made the sun shine through the host of Huns
17180,ACT IV.,"When sallow burghers slunk back to their tents,"
17181,ACT IV.,And cowered to hear their own victorious trumpet.
17182,ACT IV.,"If there be small resistance, you will find"
17183,ACT IV.,"These Citizens all Lions, like their Standard;[437]"
17184,ACT IV.,"But if there's much to do, you'll wish, with me,"
17185,ACT IV.,A band of iron rustics at our backs.                                40
17186,ACT IV.,
17187,ACT IV.,"_Ber_. Thus thinking, I must marvel you resolve"
17188,ACT IV.,To strike the blow so suddenly.
17189,ACT IV.,
17190,ACT IV.,_Doge_.                        Such blows
17191,ACT IV.,Must be struck suddenly or never. When
17192,ACT IV.,I had o'ermastered the weak false remorse
17193,ACT IV.,"Which yearned about my heart, too fondly yielding"
17194,ACT IV.,"A moment to the feelings of old days,"
17195,ACT IV.,"I was most fain to strike; and, firstly, that"
17196,ACT IV.,I might not yield again to such emotions;
17197,ACT IV.,"And, secondly, because of all these men,"
17198,ACT IV.,"Save Israel and Philip Calendaro,                                   50"
17199,ACT IV.,I know not well the courage or the faith:
17200,ACT IV.,"To-day might find 'mongst them a traitor to us,"
17201,ACT IV.,As yesterday a thousand to the Senate;
17202,ACT IV.,"But once in, with their hilts hot in their hands,"
17203,ACT IV.,"They must _on_ for their own sakes; one stroke struck,"
17204,ACT IV.,"And the mere instinct of the first-born Cain,"
17205,ACT IV.,"Which ever lurks somewhere in human hearts,"
17206,ACT IV.,"Though Circumstance may keep it in abeyance,"
17207,ACT IV.,Will urge the rest on like to wolves; the sight
17208,ACT IV.,"Of blood to crowds begets the thirst of more,                       60"
17209,ACT IV.,As the first wine-cup leads to the long revel;
17210,ACT IV.,And you will find a harder task to quell
17211,ACT IV.,"Than urge them when they _have_ commenced, but _till_"
17212,ACT IV.,"That moment, a mere voice, a straw, a shadow,"
17213,ACT IV.,Are capable of turning them aside.--
17214,ACT IV.,How goes the night?
17215,ACT IV.,
17216,ACT IV.,_Ber. F._          Almost upon the dawn.
17217,ACT IV.,
17218,ACT IV.,_Doge_. Then it is time to strike upon the bell.
17219,ACT IV.,Are the men posted?
17220,ACT IV.,
17221,ACT IV.,_Ber. F._          By this time they are;
17222,ACT IV.,"But they have orders not to strike, until"
17223,ACT IV.,They have command from you through me in person.                    70
17224,ACT IV.,
17225,ACT IV.,_Doge_. 'Tis well.--Will the morn never put to rest
17226,ACT IV.,These stars which twinkle yet o'er all the heavens?
17227,ACT IV.,"I am settled and bound up, and being so,"
17228,ACT IV.,The very effort which it cost me to
17229,ACT IV.,"Resolve to cleanse this Commonwealth with fire,"
17230,ACT IV.,"Now leaves my mind more steady. I have wept,"
17231,ACT IV.,And trembled at the thought of this dread duty;
17232,ACT IV.,"But now I have put down all idle passion,"
17233,ACT IV.,"And look the growing tempest in the face,"
17234,ACT IV.,As doth the pilot of an Admiral Galley:[438]                        80
17235,ACT IV.,"Yet (wouldst thou think it, kinsman?) it hath been"
17236,ACT IV.,"A greater struggle to me, than when nations"
17237,ACT IV.,"Beheld their fate merged in the approaching fight,"
17238,ACT IV.,"Where I was leader of a phalanx, where"
17239,ACT IV.,"Thousands were sure to perish--Yes, to spill"
17240,ACT IV.,The rank polluted current from the veins
17241,ACT IV.,Of a few bloated despots needed more
17242,ACT IV.,To steel me to a purpose such as made
17243,ACT IV.,"Timoleon immortal,[439] than to face"
17244,ACT IV.,The toils and dangers of a life of war.                             90
17245,ACT IV.,
17246,ACT IV.,_Ber. F._ It gladdens me to see your former wisdom
17247,ACT IV.,Subdue the furies which so wrung you ere
17248,ACT IV.,You were decided.
17249,ACT IV.,
17250,ACT IV.,_Doge_.          It was ever thus
17251,ACT IV.,With me; the hour of agitation came
17252,ACT IV.,"In the first glimmerings of a purpose, when"
17253,ACT IV.,Passion had too much room to sway; but in
17254,ACT IV.,The hour of action I have stood as calm
17255,ACT IV.,As were the dead who lay around me: this
17256,ACT IV.,"They knew who made me what I am, and trusted"
17257,ACT IV.,To the subduing power which I preserved                            100
17258,ACT IV.,"Over my mood, when its first burst was spent."
17259,ACT IV.,But they were not aware that there are things
17260,ACT IV.,"Which make revenge a virtue by reflection,"
17261,ACT IV.,And not an impulse of mere anger; though
17262,ACT IV.,"The laws sleep, Justice wakes, and injured souls"
17263,ACT IV.,"Oft do a public right with private wrong,"
17264,ACT IV.,And justify their deeds unto themselves.--
17265,ACT IV.,"Methinks the day breaks--is it not so? look,"
17266,ACT IV.,Thine eyes are clear with youth;--the air puts on
17267,ACT IV.,"A morning freshness, and, at least to me,                          110"
17268,ACT IV.,The sea looks greyer through the lattice.
17269,ACT IV.,
17270,ACT IV.,"_Ber. F._                                True,"
17271,ACT IV.,The morn is dappling in the sky.[er][440]
17272,ACT IV.,
17273,ACT IV.,_Doge_.                               Away then!
17274,ACT IV.,"See that they strike without delay, and with"
17275,ACT IV.,"The first toll from St. Mark's, march on the palace"
17276,ACT IV.,With all our House's strength; here I will meet you;
17277,ACT IV.,The Sixteen and their companies will move
17278,ACT IV.,In separate columns at the self-same moment:
17279,ACT IV.,Be sure you post yourself at the great Gate:
17280,ACT IV.,"I would not trust ""the Ten"" except to us--"
17281,ACT IV.,"The rest, the rabble of patricians, may                            120"
17282,ACT IV.,Glut the more careless swords of those leagued with us.
17283,ACT IV.,"Remember that the cry is still ""Saint Mark!"

17286,ACT IV.,
17287,ACT IV.,"_Ber. F._ Farewell then, noble Uncle! we will meet"
17288,ACT IV.,"In freedom and true sovereignty, or never!"
17289,ACT IV.,
17290,ACT IV.,"_Doge_. Come hither, my Bertuccio--one embrace;"
17291,ACT IV.,"Speed, for the day grows broader; send me soon"
17292,ACT IV.,A messenger to tell me how all goes
17293,ACT IV.,"When you rejoin our troops, and then sound--sound                  130"
17294,ACT IV.,The storm-bell from St. Mark's![et]
17295,ACT IV.,[_Exit_ BERTUCCIO FALIERO.
17296,ACT IV.,
17297,ACT IV.,"_Doge_ (_solus_).                 He is gone,"
17298,ACT IV.,And on each footstep moves a life. 'Tis done.[441]
17299,ACT IV.,Now the destroying Angel hovers o'er
17300,ACT IV.,"Venice, and pauses ere he pours the vial,"
17301,ACT IV.,"Even as the eagle overlooks his prey,"
17302,ACT IV.,"And for a moment, poised in middle air,"
17303,ACT IV.,"Suspends the motion of his mighty wings,"
17304,ACT IV.,Then swoops with his unerring beak.[442] Thou Day!
17305,ACT IV.,That slowly walk'st the waters! march--march on--
17306,ACT IV.,"I would not smite i' the dark, but rather see                      140"
17307,ACT IV.,"That no stroke errs. And you, ye blue sea waves!"
17308,ACT IV.,"I have seen you dyed ere now, and deeply too,"
17309,ACT IV.,"With Genoese, Saracen, and Hunnish gore,"
17310,ACT IV.,"While that of Venice flowed too, but victorious:"
17311,ACT IV.,Now thou must wear an unmixed crimson; no
17312,ACT IV.,Barbaric blood can reconcile us now
17313,ACT IV.,"Unto that horrible incarnadine,"
17314,ACT IV.,But friend or foe will roll in civic slaughter.
17315,ACT IV.,And have I lived to fourscore years[443] for this?
17316,ACT IV.,"I, who was named Preserver of the City?                            150"
17317,ACT IV.,"I, at whose name the million's caps were flung[eu]"
17318,ACT IV.,"Into the air, and cries from tens of thousands"
17319,ACT IV.,"Rose up, imploring Heaven to send me blessings,"
17320,ACT IV.,"And fame, and length of days--to see this day?"
17321,ACT IV.,"But this day, black within the calendar,"
17322,ACT IV.,Shall be succeeded by a bright millennium.
17323,ACT IV.,Doge Dandolo survived to ninety summers
17324,ACT IV.,"To vanquish empires, and refuse their crown;[444]"
17325,ACT IV.,"I will resign a crown, and make the State"
17326,ACT IV.,Renew its freedom--but oh! by what means?                          160
17327,ACT IV.,The noble end must justify them. What
17328,ACT IV.,"Are a few drops of human blood? 'tis false,"
17329,ACT IV.,"The blood of tyrants is not human; they,"
17330,ACT IV.,"Like to incarnate Molochs, feed on ours,"
17331,ACT IV.,Until 'tis time to give them to the tombs
17332,ACT IV.,Which they have made so populous.--Oh World!
17333,ACT IV.,"Oh Men! what are ye, and our best designs,"
17334,ACT IV.,That we must work by crime to punish crime?
17335,ACT IV.,"And slay as if Death had but this one gate,"
17336,ACT IV.,When a few years would make the sword superfluous?                 170
17337,ACT IV.,"And I, upon the verge of th' unknown realm,"
17338,ACT IV.,Yet send so many heralds on before me?--
17339,ACT IV.,I must not ponder this.                                    [_A pause._
17340,ACT IV.,Hark! was there not
17341,ACT IV.,"A murmur as of distant voices, and"
17342,ACT IV.,The tramp of feet in martial unison?
17343,ACT IV.,What phantoms even of sound our wishes raise!
17344,ACT IV.,It cannot be--the signal hath not rung--
17345,ACT IV.,Why pauses it? My nephew's messenger
17346,ACT IV.,"Should be upon his way to me, and he"
17347,ACT IV.,Himself perhaps even now draws grating back                        180

17351,ACT IV.,"Or for a state in peril, pealing forth"
17352,ACT IV.,"Tremendous bodements; let it do its office,"
17353,ACT IV.,And be this peal its awfullest and last
17354,ACT IV.,Sound till the strong tower rock!--What! silent still?
17355,ACT IV.,"I would go forth, but that my post is here,"
17356,ACT IV.,To be the centre of re-union to
17357,ACT IV.,The oft discordant elements which form                             190
17358,ACT IV.,"Leagues of this nature, and to keep compact"
17359,ACT IV.,"The wavering of the weak, in case of conflict;"

17377,ACT IV.,Behold my order from the assembled Ten.
17378,ACT IV.,
17379,ACT IV.,"_Doge_. And _where_ are they, and _why_ assembled? no"
17380,ACT IV.,"Such Council can be lawful, till the Prince"

17383,ACT IV.,To the Council chamber.
17384,ACT IV.,

17386,ACT IV.,"Nor are they in the wonted Hall of Council,"
17387,ACT IV.,But sitting in the convent of Saint Saviour's.                     210
17388,ACT IV.,
17389,ACT IV.,"_Doge_. You dare to disobey me, then?"

17414,ACT IV.,"Hark, Signor of the Night! and you, ye hirelings,"

17439,ACT IV.,And learn (if souls so much obscured can bear
17440,ACT IV.,To gaze upon the sunbeams) to be free.

17515,ACT IV.,_1st Sig_. I am not warranted to answer that.
17516,ACT IV.,
17517,ACT IV.,"_Ber. F._ I'll answer for thee--'tis a certain Bertram,"
17518,ACT IV.,Even now deposing to the secret Giunta.
17519,ACT IV.,
17520,ACT IV.,"_Doge_. Bertram, the Bergamask! With what vile tools[448]"
17521,ACT IV.,"We operate to slay or save! This creature,"
17522,ACT IV.,"Black with a double treason, now will earn"
17523,ACT IV.,"Rewards and honours, and be stamped in story"
17524,ACT IV.,"With the geese in the Capitol, which gabbled"
17525,ACT IV.,"Till Rome awoke, and had an annual triumph,                        300"
17526,ACT IV.,"While Manlius, who hurled down the Gauls, was cast[ez]"
17527,ACT IV.,From the Tarpeian.
17528,ACT IV.,
17529,ACT IV.,"_1st Sig_.          He aspired to treason,"
17530,ACT IV.,And sought to rule the State.
17531,ACT IV.,
17532,ACT IV.,"_Doge_.                       He saved the State,"
17533,ACT IV.,And sought but to reform what he revived--
17534,ACT IV.,"But this is idle--Come, sirs, do your work."
17535,ACT IV.,
17536,ACT IV.,"_1st Sig_. Noble Bertuccio, we must now remove you"
17537,ACT IV.,Into an inner chamber.
17538,ACT IV.,
17539,ACT IV.,"_Ber. F._               Farewell, Uncle!"
17540,ACT IV.,"If we shall meet again in life I know not,"
17541,ACT IV.,But they perhaps will let our ashes mingle.
17542,ACT IV.,
17543,ACT IV.,"_Doge_. Yes, and our spirits, which shall yet go forth,            310"
17544,ACT IV.,"And do what our frail clay, thus clogged, hath failed in!"
17545,ACT IV.,They cannot quench the memory of those
17546,ACT IV.,"Who would have hurled them from their guilty thrones,"
17547,ACT IV.,"And such examples will find heirs, though distant."

17552,ACT V.,ACT V.
17553,ACT V.,
17554,ACT V.,
17555,ACT V.,SCENE 1.--_The Hall of the Council of Ten assembled with the additional
17556,ACT V.,"Senators, who, on the Trials of the Conspirators for the Treason of_"
17557,ACT V.,"MARINO FALIERO, _composed what was called the Giunta,--Guards, Officers,"
17558,ACT V.,"etc., etc._ ISRAEL BERTUCCIO _and_ PHILIP CALENDARO _as Prisoners_."
17559,ACT V.,"BERTRAM, LIONI, _and Witnesses, etc._"
17560,ACT V.,
17561,ACT V.,"_The Chief of the Ten_, BENINTENDE.[fa][449]"
17562,ACT V.,
17563,ACT V.,"_Ben_. There now rests, after such conviction of"
17564,ACT V.,"Their manifold and manifest offences,"
17565,ACT V.,But to pronounce on these obdurate men
17566,ACT V.,The sentence of the Law:--a grievous task
17567,ACT V.,"To those who hear, and those who speak. Alas!"
17568,ACT V.,That it should fall to me! and that my days
17569,ACT V.,Of office should be stigmatised through all
17570,ACT V.,"The years of coming time, as bearing record"
17571,ACT V.,To this most foul and complicated treason
17572,ACT V.,"Against a just and free state, known to all                         10"
17573,ACT V.,The earth as being the Christian bulwark 'gainst
17574,ACT V.,"The Saracen and the schismatic Greek,"
17575,ACT V.,"The savage Hun, and not less barbarous Frank;"
17576,ACT V.,A City which has opened India's wealth
17577,ACT V.,To Europe; the last Roman refuge from
17578,ACT V.,O'erwhelming Attila; the Ocean's Queen;
17579,ACT V.,Proud Genoa's prouder rival! 'Tis to sap
17580,ACT V.,"The throne of such a City, these lost men"
17581,ACT V.,Have risked and forfeited their worthless lives--
17582,ACT V.,So let them die the death.
17583,ACT V.,
17584,ACT V.,_I. Ber_.                  We are prepared;                         20
17585,ACT V.,Your racks have done that for us. Let us die.
17586,ACT V.,
17587,ACT V.,_Ben_. If ye have that to say which would obtain
17588,ACT V.,"Abatement of your punishment, the Giunta"
17589,ACT V.,"Will hear you; if you have aught to confess,"
17590,ACT V.,"Now is your time,--perhaps it may avail ye."
17591,ACT V.,
17592,ACT V.,"_I. Ber_. We stand to hear, and not to speak."
17593,ACT V.,
17594,ACT V.,_Ben_.                                       Your crimes
17595,ACT V.,"Are fully proved by your accomplices,"
17596,ACT V.,And all which Circumstance can add to aid them;
17597,ACT V.,Yet we would hear from your own lips complete
17598,ACT V.,Avowal of your treason: on the verge                                30
17599,ACT V.,"Of that dread gulf which none repass, the truth"
17600,ACT V.,Alone can profit you on earth or Heaven--
17601,ACT V.,"Say, then, what was your motive?"
17602,ACT V.,
17603,ACT V.,_I. Ber_.                         Justice![fb]
17604,ACT V.,
17605,ACT V.,_Ben_.                                      What
17606,ACT V.,Your object?
17607,ACT V.,
17608,ACT V.,_I. Ber_.   Freedom!
17609,ACT V.,
17610,ACT V.,"_Ben_.              You are brief, sir."
17611,ACT V.,
17612,ACT V.,_I. Ber_. So my life grows: I
17613,ACT V.,"Was bred a soldier, not a senator."
17614,ACT V.,
17615,ACT V.,_Ben_. Perhaps you think by this blunt brevity
17616,ACT V.,To brave your judges to postpone the sentence?
17617,ACT V.,
17618,ACT V.,"_I. Ber_. Do you be brief as I am, and believe me,"
17619,ACT V.,I shall prefer that mercy to your pardon.                           40
17620,ACT V.,
17621,ACT V.,_Ben_. Is this your sole reply to the Tribunal?
17622,ACT V.,
17623,ACT V.,"_I. Ber_. Go, ask your racks what they have wrung from us,"
17624,ACT V.,"Or place us there again; we have still some blood left,"
17625,ACT V.,And some slight sense of pain in these wrenched limbs:
17626,ACT V.,But this ye dare not do; for if we die there--
17627,ACT V.,And you have left us little life to spend
17628,ACT V.,"Upon your engines, gorged with pangs already--"
17629,ACT V.,"Ye lose the public spectacle, with which"
17630,ACT V.,You would appal your slaves to further slavery!
17631,ACT V.,"Groans are not words, nor agony assent,                             50"
17632,ACT V.,"Nor affirmation Truth, if Nature's sense"
17633,ACT V.,"Should overcome the soul into a lie,"
17634,ACT V.,For a short respite--must we bear or die?
17635,ACT V.,
17636,ACT V.,"_Ben_. Say, who were your accomplices?"
17637,ACT V.,
17638,ACT V.,_I. Ber_.                              The Senate.
17639,ACT V.,
17640,ACT V.,_Ben_. What do you mean?
17641,ACT V.,
17642,ACT V.,"_I. Ber_.                 Ask of the suffering people,"
17643,ACT V.,Whom your patrician crimes have driven to crime.
17644,ACT V.,
17645,ACT V.,_Ben_. You know the Doge?
17646,ACT V.,
17647,ACT V.,_I. Ber_.                  I served with him at Zara
17648,ACT V.,"In the field, when _you_ were pleading here your way"
17649,ACT V.,"To present office; we exposed our lives,"
17650,ACT V.,"While you but hazarded the lives of others,                         60"
17651,ACT V.,Alike by accusation or defence;
17652,ACT V.,"And for the rest, all Venice knows her Doge,"
17653,ACT V.,"Through his great actions, and the Senate's insults."
17654,ACT V.,
17655,ACT V.,_Ben_. You have held conference with him?
17656,ACT V.,
17657,ACT V.,_I. Ber_.                                I am weary--
17658,ACT V.,Even wearier of your questions than your tortures:
17659,ACT V.,I pray you pass to judgment.
17660,ACT V.,
17661,ACT V.,_Ben_.                         It is coming.
17662,ACT V.,"And you, too, Philip Calendaro, what"
17663,ACT V.,Have you to say why you should not be doomed?
17664,ACT V.,
17665,ACT V.,"_Cal_. I never was a man of many words,"
17666,ACT V.,And now have few left worth the utterance.                          70
17667,ACT V.,
17668,ACT V.,_Ben_. A further application of yon engine
17669,ACT V.,May change your tone.
17670,ACT V.,
17671,ACT V.,"_Cal_.                 Most true, it _will_ do so;"
17672,ACT V.,A former application did so; but
17673,ACT V.,"It will not change my words, or, if it did--"
17674,ACT V.,
17675,ACT V.,_Ben_. What then?
17676,ACT V.,
17677,ACT V.,_Cal_.             Will my avowal on yon rack
17678,ACT V.,Stand good in law?
17679,ACT V.,
17680,ACT V.,_Ben_.             Assuredly.
17681,ACT V.,
17682,ACT V.,_Cal_.                          Whoe'er
17683,ACT V.,The culprit be whom I accuse of treason?
17684,ACT V.,
17685,ACT V.,"_Ben_. Without doubt, he will be brought up to trial."
17686,ACT V.,
17687,ACT V.,_Cal_. And on this testimony would he perish?
17688,ACT V.,
17689,ACT V.,"_Ben_. So your confession be detailed and full,                     80"
17690,ACT V.,He will stand here in peril of his life.
17691,ACT V.,
17692,ACT V.,"_Cal_. Then look well to thy proud self, President!"
17693,ACT V.,"For by the Eternity which yawns before me,"
17694,ACT V.,"I swear that _thou_, and only thou, shall be"
17695,ACT V.,"The traitor I denounce upon that rack,"
17696,ACT V.,If I be stretched there for the second time.
17697,ACT V.,
17698,ACT V.,"_One of the Giunta_. Lord President,'twere best proceed to judgment;"
17699,ACT V.,There is no more to be drawn from these men.[fc]
17700,ACT V.,
17701,ACT V.,_Ben_. Unhappy men! prepare for instant death.
17702,ACT V.,The nature of your crime--our law--and peril                        90
17703,ACT V.,"The State now stands in, leave not an hour's respite."
17704,ACT V.,"Guards! lead them forth, and upon the balcony"
17705,ACT V.,"Of the red columns, where, on festal Thursday,[450]"
17706,ACT V.,"The Doge stands to behold the chase of bulls,"
17707,ACT V.,Let them be justified: and leave exposed
17708,ACT V.,"Their wavering relics, in the place of judgment,"
17709,ACT V.,To the full view of the assembled people!
17710,ACT V.,And Heaven have mercy on their souls!
17711,ACT V.,
17712,ACT V.,_The Giunta_.                           Amen!
17713,ACT V.,
17714,ACT V.,"_I. Ber_. Signors, farewell! we shall not all again"
17715,ACT V.,Meet in one place.
17716,ACT V.,
17717,ACT V.,_Ben_.            And lest they should essay                       100
17718,ACT V.,To stir up the distracted multitude--
17719,ACT V.,Guards! let their mouths be gagged[451] even in the act
17720,ACT V.,Of execution. Lead them hence!
17721,ACT V.,
17722,ACT V.,_Cal_.                        What! must we
17723,ACT V.,"Not even say farewell to some fond friend,"
17724,ACT V.,Nor leave a last word with our confessor?
17725,ACT V.,
17726,ACT V.,_Ben_. A priest is waiting in the antechamber;
17727,ACT V.,"But, for your friends, such interviews would be"
17728,ACT V.,"Painful to them, and useless all to you."
17729,ACT V.,
17730,ACT V.,_Cal_. I knew that we were gagged in life; at least
17731,ACT V.,All those who had not heart to risk their lives                    110
17732,ACT V.,Upon their open thoughts; but still I deemed
17733,ACT V.,"That in the last few moments, the same idle"
17734,ACT V.,"Freedom of speech accorded to the dying,"
17735,ACT V.,Would not now be denied to us; but since----
17736,ACT V.,
17737,ACT V.,"_I. Ber_. Even let them have their way, brave Calendaro!"
17738,ACT V.,What matter a few syllables? let's die
17739,ACT V.,Without the slightest show of favour from them;
17740,ACT V.,So shall our blood more readily arise
17741,ACT V.,"To Heaven against them, and more testify"
17742,ACT V.,"To their atrocities, than could a volume                           120"
17743,ACT V.,Spoken or written of our dying words!
17744,ACT V.,"They tremble at our voices--nay, they dread"
17745,ACT V.,Our very silence--let them live in fear!
17746,ACT V.,"Leave them unto their thoughts, and let us now"
17747,ACT V.,Address our own above!--Lead on; we are ready.
17748,ACT V.,
17749,ACT V.,"_Cal_. Israel, hadst thou but hearkened unto me"
17750,ACT V.,"It had not now been thus; and yon pale villain,"
17751,ACT V.,"The coward Bertram, would----"
17752,ACT V.,
17753,ACT V.,"_I. Ber_.                      Peace, Calendaro!"
17754,ACT V.,What brooks it now to ponder upon this?
17755,ACT V.,
17756,ACT V.,_Bert_. Alas! I fain you died in peace with me:                    130
17757,ACT V.,I did not seek this task; 'twas forced upon me:
17758,ACT V.,"Say, you forgive me, though I never can"
17759,ACT V.,Retrieve my own forgiveness--frown not thus!
17760,ACT V.,
17761,ACT V.,_I. Ber_. I die and pardon thee!
17762,ACT V.,
17763,ACT V.,_Cal_. (_spitting at him_).[452] I die and scorn thee!
17764,ACT V.,"[_Exeunt_ ISRAEL BERTUCCIO _and_ PHILIP CALENDARO, _Guards, etc_."
17765,ACT V.,
17766,ACT V.,"_Ben_. Now that these criminals have been disposed of,"
17767,ACT V.,'Tis time that we proceed to pass our sentence
17768,ACT V.,Upon the greatest traitor upon record
17769,ACT V.,"In any annals, the Doge Faliero!"
17770,ACT V.,The proofs and process are complete; the time
17771,ACT V.,And crime require a quick procedure: shall                         140
17772,ACT V.,He now be called in to receive the award?
17773,ACT V.,
17774,ACT V.,"_The Giunta_. Aye, aye."
17775,ACT V.,
17776,ACT V.,"_Ben_.                   Avogadori, order that the Doge"
17777,ACT V.,Be brought before the Council.
17778,ACT V.,
17779,ACT V.,"_One of the Giunta_.            And the rest,"
17780,ACT V.,When shall they be brought up?
17781,ACT V.,
17782,ACT V.,_Ben_.                          When all the Chiefs
17783,ACT V.,Have been disposed of. Some have fled to Chiozza;
17784,ACT V.,"But there are thousands in pursuit of them,"
17785,ACT V.,"And such precaution ta'en on terra firma,"
17786,ACT V.,"As well as in the islands, that we hope"
17787,ACT V.,None will escape to utter in strange lands
17788,ACT V.,His libellous tale of treasons 'gainst the Senate.                 150
17789,ACT V.,
17790,ACT V.,"_Enter the_ DOGE _as Prisoner, with Guards, etc., etc._"
17791,ACT V.,
17792,ACT V.,"_Ben_. Doge--for such still you are, and by the law"
17793,ACT V.,"Must be considered, till the hour shall come"
17794,ACT V.,When you must doff the Ducal Bonnet from
17795,ACT V.,"That head, which could not wear a crown more noble"
17796,ACT V.,"Than Empires can confer, in quiet honour,"
17797,ACT V.,"But it must plot to overthrow your peers,"
17798,ACT V.,"Who made you what you are, and quench in blood"
17799,ACT V.,A City's glory--we have laid already
17800,ACT V.,"Before you in your chamber at full length,"
17801,ACT V.,"By the Avogadori, all the proofs                                   160"
17802,ACT V.,Which have appeared against you; and more ample
17803,ACT V.,Ne'er reared their sanguinary shadows to
17804,ACT V.,Confront a traitor. What have you to say
17805,ACT V.,In your defence?
17806,ACT V.,
17807,ACT V.,"_Doge_.            What shall I say to ye,"
17808,ACT V.,Since my defence must be your condemnation?
17809,ACT V.,"You are at once offenders and accusers,"
17810,ACT V.,Judges and Executioners!--Proceed
17811,ACT V.,Upon your power.
17812,ACT V.,
17813,ACT V.,_Ben_.             Your chief accomplices
17814,ACT V.,"Having confessed, there is no hope for you."
17815,ACT V.,
17816,ACT V.,_Doge_. And who be they?
17817,ACT V.,
17818,ACT V.,_Ben_.                    In number many; but                      170
17819,ACT V.,"The first now stands before you in the court,"
17820,ACT V.,"Bertram of Bergamo,--would you question him?"
17821,ACT V.,
17822,ACT V.,_Doge_ (_looking at him contemptuously_).        No.
17823,ACT V.,
17824,ACT V.,"_Ben_. And two others, Israel Bertuccio,"
17825,ACT V.,"And Philip Calendaro, have admitted"
17826,ACT V.,Their fellowship in treason with the Doge!
17827,ACT V.,
17828,ACT V.,_Doge_. And where are they?
17829,ACT V.,
17830,ACT V.,"_Ben_.                    Gone to their place, and now"
17831,ACT V.,Answering to Heaven for what they did on earth.
17832,ACT V.,
17833,ACT V.,"_Doge_. Ah! the plebeian Brutus, is he gone?"
17834,ACT V.,And the quick Cassius of the arsenal?--
17835,ACT V.,How did they meet their doom?
17836,ACT V.,
17837,ACT V.,_Ben_.                        Think of your own:                   180
17838,ACT V.,"It is approaching. You decline to plead, then?[fd]"
17839,ACT V.,
17840,ACT V.,"_Doge_. I cannot plead to my inferiors, nor"
17841,ACT V.,Can recognise your legal power to try me.
17842,ACT V.,Show me the law!
17843,ACT V.,
17844,ACT V.,"_Ben_.           On great emergencies,"
17845,ACT V.,The law must be remodelled or amended:
17846,ACT V.,Our fathers had not fixed the punishment
17847,ACT V.,"Of such a crime, as on the old Roman tables"
17848,ACT V.,The sentence against parricide was left
17849,ACT V.,In pure forgetfulness; they could not render
17850,ACT V.,"That penal, which had neither name nor thought                     190"
17851,ACT V.,In their great bosoms; who would have foreseen
17852,ACT V.,That Nature could be filed to such a crime[453]
17853,ACT V.,"As sons 'gainst sires, and princes 'gainst their realms?"
17854,ACT V.,Your sin hath made us make a law which will
17855,ACT V.,"Become a precedent 'gainst such haught traitors,"
17856,ACT V.,As would with treason mount to tyranny;
17857,ACT V.,"Not even contented with a sceptre, till"
17858,ACT V.,They can convert it to a two-edged sword!
17859,ACT V.,Was not the place of Doge sufficient for ye?
17860,ACT V.,What's nobler than the signory[454] of Venice?                     200
17861,ACT V.,
17862,ACT V.,_Doge_. The signory of Venice! You betrayed me--
17863,ACT V.,"_You--you_, who sit there, traitors as ye are!"
17864,ACT V.,"From my equality with you in birth,"
17865,ACT V.,"And my superiority in action,"
17866,ACT V.,You drew me from my honourable toils
17867,ACT V.,"In distant lands--on flood, in field, in cities--"
17868,ACT V.,_You_ singled me out like a victim to
17869,ACT V.,"Stand crowned, but bound and helpless, at the altar"
17870,ACT V.,"Where you alone could minister. I knew not,"
17871,ACT V.,"I sought not, wished not, dreamed not the election,                210"
17872,ACT V.,"Which reached me first at Rome, and I obeyed;"
17873,ACT V.,"But found on my arrival, that, besides"
17874,ACT V.,The jealous vigilance which always led you
17875,ACT V.,"To mock and mar your Sovereign's best intents,"
17876,ACT V.,"You had, even in the interregnum[455] of"
17877,ACT V.,"My journey to the capital, curtailed"
17878,ACT V.,And mutilated the few privileges
17879,ACT V.,"Yet left the Duke: all this I bore, and would"
17880,ACT V.,"Have borne, until my very hearth was stained"
17881,ACT V.,"By the pollution of your ribaldry,                                 220"
17882,ACT V.,"And he, the ribald, whom I see amongst you--"
17883,ACT V.,Fit judge in such tribunal!----
17884,ACT V.,
17885,ACT V.,_Ben_. (_interrupting him_).        Michel Steno
17886,ACT V.,"Is here in virtue of his office, as"
17887,ACT V.,"One of the Forty; ""the Ten"" having craved"
17888,ACT V.,A Giunta of patricians from the Senate
17889,ACT V.,To aid our judgment in a trial arduous
17890,ACT V.,And novel as the present: he was set
17891,ACT V.,"Free from the penalty pronounced upon him,"
17892,ACT V.,"Because the Doge, who should protect the law,"
17893,ACT V.,"Seeking to abrogate all law, can claim                             230"
17894,ACT V.,No punishment of others by the statutes
17895,ACT V.,Which he himself denies and violates!
17896,ACT V.,
17897,ACT V.,"_Doge_. _His_ punishment! I rather see him _there_,"
17898,ACT V.,"Where he now sits, to glut him with my death,"
17899,ACT V.,"Than in the mockery of castigation,"
17900,ACT V.,"Which your foul, outward, juggling show of justice"
17901,ACT V.,"Decreed as sentence! Base as was his crime,"
17902,ACT V.,'Twas purity compared with your protection.
17903,ACT V.,
17904,ACT V.,"_Ben_. And can it be, that the great Doge of Venice,"
17905,ACT V.,With three parts of a century of years                             240
17906,ACT V.,"And honours on his head, could thus allow"
17907,ACT V.,"His fury, like an angry boy's, to master"
17908,ACT V.,"All Feeling, Wisdom, Faith and Fear, on such"
17909,ACT V.,A provocation as a young man's petulance?
17910,ACT V.,
17911,ACT V.,_Doge_. A spark creates the flame--'tis the last drop
17912,ACT V.,"Which makes the cup run o'er, and mine was full"
17913,ACT V.,Already: you oppressed the Prince and people;
17914,ACT V.,"I would have freed both, and have failed in both:"
17915,ACT V.,"The price of such success would have been glory,"
17916,ACT V.,"Vengeance, and victory, and such a name                            250"
17917,ACT V.,As would have made Venetian history
17918,ACT V.,Rival to that of Greece and Syracuse
17919,ACT V.,"When they were freed, and flourished ages after,"
17920,ACT V.,And mine to Gelon and to Thrasybulus:[456]
17921,ACT V.,"Failing, I know the penalty of failure"
17922,ACT V.,Is present infamy and death--the future
17923,ACT V.,"Will judge, when Venice is no more, or free;"
17924,ACT V.,"Till then, the truth is in abeyance. Pause not;"
17925,ACT V.,"I would have shown no mercy, and I seek none;"
17926,ACT V.,"My life was staked upon a mighty hazard,                           260"
17927,ACT V.,"And being lost, take what I would have taken!"
17928,ACT V.,I would have stood alone amidst your tombs:
17929,ACT V.,"Now you may flock round mine, and trample on it,"
17930,ACT V.,As you have done upon my heart while living.[457]
17931,ACT V.,
17932,ACT V.,"_Ben_. You do confess then, and admit the justice"
17933,ACT V.,Of our Tribunal?
17934,ACT V.,
17935,ACT V.,_Doge_.            I confess to have failed;
17936,ACT V.,Fortune is female: from my youth her favours
17937,ACT V.,"Were not withheld, the fault was mine to hope"
17938,ACT V.,Her former smiles again at this late hour.
17939,ACT V.,
17940,ACT V.,_Ben_. You do not then in aught arraign our equity?                270
17941,ACT V.,
17942,ACT V.,_Doge_. Noble Venetians! stir me not with questions.
17943,ACT V.,I am resigned to the worst; but in me still
17944,ACT V.,"Have something of the blood of brighter days,"
17945,ACT V.,"And am not over-patient. Pray you, spare me"
17946,ACT V.,"Further interrogation, which boots nothing,"
17947,ACT V.,Except to turn a trial to debate.
17948,ACT V.,"I shall but answer that which will offend you,"
17949,ACT V.,And please your enemies--a host already;
17950,ACT V.,"'Tis true, these sullen walls should yield no echo:"
17951,ACT V.,"But walls have ears--nay, more, they have tongues; and if          280"
17952,ACT V.,"There were no other way for Truth to o'erleap them,[fe]"
17953,ACT V.,"You who condemn me, you who fear and slay me,"
17954,ACT V.,Yet could not bear in silence to your graves
17955,ACT V.,What you would hear from me of Good or Evil;
17956,ACT V.,The secret were too mighty for your souls:
17957,ACT V.,"Then let it sleep in mine, unless you court"
17958,ACT V.,A danger which would double that you escape.
17959,ACT V.,"Such my defence would be, had I full scope"
17960,ACT V.,"To make it famous; for true _words_ are _things_,"
17961,ACT V.,"And dying men's are things which long outlive,                     290"
17962,ACT V.,"And oftentimes avenge them; bury mine,"
17963,ACT V.,"If ye would fain survive me: take this counsel,"
17964,ACT V.,"And though too oft ye make me live in wrath,"
17965,ACT V.,Let me die calmly; you may grant me this;
17966,ACT V.,I deny nothing--defend nothing--nothing
17967,ACT V.,"I ask of you, but silence for myself,"
17968,ACT V.,And sentence from the Court!
17969,ACT V.,
17970,ACT V.,_Ben_.                        This full admission
17971,ACT V.,Spares us the harsh necessity of ordering
17972,ACT V.,The torture to elicit the whole truth.[ff]
17973,ACT V.,
17974,ACT V.,"_Doge_. The torture! you have put me there already,                300"
17975,ACT V.,Daily since I was Doge; but if you will
17976,ACT V.,"Add the corporeal rack, you may: these limbs"
17977,ACT V.,Will yield with age to crushing iron; but
17978,ACT V.,There's that within my heart shall strain your engines.
17979,ACT V.,
17980,ACT V.,_Enter an_ OFFICER.
17981,ACT V.,
17982,ACT V.,_Officer_. Noble Venetians! Duchess Faliero[fg]
17983,ACT V.,Requests admission to the Giunta's presence.
17984,ACT V.,
17985,ACT V.,"_Ben_. Say, Conscript Fathers,[458] shall she be admitted?"
17986,ACT V.,
17987,ACT V.,_One of the Giunta_.  She may have revelations of importance
17988,ACT V.,"Unto the state, to justify compliance"
17989,ACT V.,With her request.
17990,ACT V.,
17991,ACT V.,_Ben_.              Is this the general will?                      310
17992,ACT V.,
17993,ACT V.,_All_. It is.
17994,ACT V.,
17995,ACT V.,"_Doge_.         Oh, admirable laws of Venice!"
17996,ACT V.,"Which would admit the wife, in the full hope"
17997,ACT V.,That she might testify against the husband.
17998,ACT V.,What glory to the chaste Venetian dames!
17999,ACT V.,"But such blasphemers 'gainst all Honour, as"
18000,ACT V.,"Sit here, do well to act in their vocation."
18001,ACT V.,"Now, villain Steno! if this woman fail,"
18002,ACT V.,"I'll pardon thee thy lie, and thy escape,"
18003,ACT V.,"And my own violent death, and thy vile life."
18004,ACT V.,
18005,ACT V.,_The_ DUCHESS _enters_.
18006,ACT V.,
18007,ACT V.,"_Ben_. Lady! this just Tribunal has resolved,                      320"
18008,ACT V.,"Though the request be strange, to grant it, and"
18009,ACT V.,"Whatever be its purport, to accord"
18010,ACT V.,A patient hearing with the due respect
18011,ACT V.,"Which fits your ancestry, your rank, and virtues:"
18012,ACT V.,"But you turn pale--ho! there, look to the Lady!"
18013,ACT V.,Place a chair instantly.
18014,ACT V.,
18015,ACT V.,_Ang_.                   A moment's faintness--
18016,ACT V.,"'Tis past; I pray you pardon me,--I sit not"
18017,ACT V.,"In presence of my Prince and of my husband,"
18018,ACT V.,While he is on his feet.
18019,ACT V.,
18020,ACT V.,"_Ben_.                    Your pleasure, Lady?"
18021,ACT V.,
18022,ACT V.,"_Ang_. Strange rumours, but most true, if all I hear               330"
18023,ACT V.,"And see be sooth, have reached me, and I come"
18024,ACT V.,"To know the worst, even at the worst; forgive"
18025,ACT V.,The abruptness of my entrance and my bearing.
18026,ACT V.,Is it--I cannot speak--I cannot shape
18027,ACT V.,"The question--but you answer it ere spoken,"
18028,ACT V.,"With eyes averted, and with gloomy brows--"
18029,ACT V.,Oh God! this is the silence of the grave!
18030,ACT V.,
18031,ACT V.,"_Ben_. (_after a pause_). Spare us, and spare thyself the repetition"
18032,ACT V.,"Of our most awful, but inexorable"
18033,ACT V.,Duty to Heaven and man!
18034,ACT V.,
18035,ACT V.,_Ang_.                 Yet speak; I cannot--                       340
18036,ACT V.,I cannot--no--even now believe these things.
18037,ACT V.,Is _he_ condemned?
18038,ACT V.,
18039,ACT V.,_Ben_.            Alas!
18040,ACT V.,
18041,ACT V.,_Ang_.                   And was he guilty?
18042,ACT V.,
18043,ACT V.,_Ben_. Lady! the natural distraction of
18044,ACT V.,Thy thoughts at such a moment makes the question
18045,ACT V.,Merit forgiveness; else a doubt like this
18046,ACT V.,Against a just and paramount tribunal
18047,ACT V.,"Were deep offence. But question even the Doge,"
18048,ACT V.,"And if he can deny the proofs, believe him"
18049,ACT V.,Guiltless as thy own bosom.
18050,ACT V.,
18051,ACT V.,_Ang_.                       Is it so?
18052,ACT V.,"My Lord, my Sovereign, my poor father's friend,                    350"
18053,ACT V.,"The mighty in the field, the sage in Council,"
18054,ACT V.,Unsay the words of this man!--thou art silent!
18055,ACT V.,
18056,ACT V.,"_Ben_. He hath already owned to his own guilt,[fh]"
18057,ACT V.,"Nor, as thou see'st, doth he deny it now."
18058,ACT V.,
18059,ACT V.,"_Ang_. Aye, but he must not die! Spare his few years,"
18060,ACT V.,Which Grief and Shame will soon cut down to days!
18061,ACT V.,One day of baffled crime must not efface
18062,ACT V.,Near sixteen lustres crowned with brave acts.
18063,ACT V.,
18064,ACT V.,_Ben_. His doom must be fulfilled without remission
18065,ACT V.,Of time or penalty--'tis a decree.                                 360
18066,ACT V.,
18067,ACT V.,"_Ang_. He hath been guilty, but there may be mercy."
18068,ACT V.,
18069,ACT V.,_Ben_. Not in this case with justice.
18070,ACT V.,
18071,ACT V.,"_Ang_.                                 Alas! Signor,"
18072,ACT V.,He who is only just is cruel; who
18073,ACT V.,Upon the earth would live were all judged justly?
18074,ACT V.,
18075,ACT V.,_Ben_. His punishment is safety to the State.
18076,ACT V.,
18077,ACT V.,"_Ang_. He was a subject, and hath served the State;"
18078,ACT V.,"He was your General, and hath saved the State;"
18079,ACT V.,"He is your Sovereign, and hath ruled the State.[fi]"
18080,ACT V.,
18081,ACT V.,"_One of the Council_. He is a traitor, and betrayed the State."
18082,ACT V.,
18083,ACT V.,"_Ang_. And, but for him, there now had been no State               370"
18084,ACT V.,"To save or to destroy; and you, who sit"
18085,ACT V.,"There to pronounce the death of your deliverer,"
18086,ACT V.,"Had now been groaning at a Moslem oar,"
18087,ACT V.,Or digging in the Hunnish mines in fetters!
18088,ACT V.,
18089,ACT V.,"_One of the Council_. No, Lady, there are others who would die"
18090,ACT V.,Rather than breathe in slavery!
18091,ACT V.,
18092,ACT V.,_Ang_.                           If there are so
18093,ACT V.,"Within _these_ walls, _thou_ art not of the number:"
18094,ACT V.,The truly brave are generous to the fallen!--
18095,ACT V.,Is there no hope?
18096,ACT V.,
18097,ACT V.,"_Ben_.             Lady, it cannot be."
18098,ACT V.,
18099,ACT V.,_Ang_. (_turning to the Doge_).
18100,ACT V.,"Then die, Faliero! since it must be so;                            380"
18101,ACT V.,But with the spirit of my father's friend.
18102,ACT V.,"Thou hast been guilty of a great offence,"
18103,ACT V.,Half cancelled by the harshness of these men.
18104,ACT V.,"I would have sued to them, have prayed to them."
18105,ACT V.,"Have begged as famished mendicants for bread,"
18106,ACT V.,Have wept as they will cry unto their God
18107,ACT V.,"For mercy, and be answered as they answer,--"
18108,ACT V.,"Had it been fitting for thy name or mine,"
18109,ACT V.,And if the cruelty in their cold eyes
18110,ACT V.,Had not announced the heartless wrath within.                      390
18111,ACT V.,"Then, as a Prince, address thee to thy doom!"
18112,ACT V.,
18113,ACT V.,_Doge_. I have lived too long not to know how to die!
18114,ACT V.,Thy suing to these men were but the bleating
18115,ACT V.,"Of the lamb to the butcher, or the cry"
18116,ACT V.,Of seamen to the surge: I would not take
18117,ACT V.,"A life eternal, granted at the hands"
18118,ACT V.,"Of wretches, from whose monstrous villanies"
18119,ACT V.,I sought to free the groaning nations!
18120,ACT V.,
18121,ACT V.,"_Michel Steno_.                        Doge,"
18122,ACT V.,"A word with thee, and with this noble lady,"
18123,ACT V.,Whom I have grievously offended. Would                             400
18124,ACT V.,"Sorrow, or shame, or penance on my part,"
18125,ACT V.,Could cancel the inexorable past!
18126,ACT V.,"But since that cannot be, as Christians let us"
18127,ACT V.,"Say farewell, and in peace: with full contrition"
18128,ACT V.,"I crave, not pardon, but compassion from you,"
18129,ACT V.,"And give, however weak, my prayers for both."
18130,ACT V.,
18131,ACT V.,"_Ang_. Sage Benintende, now chief Judge of Venice,"
18132,ACT V.,I speak to thee in answer to yon Signor.
18133,ACT V.,"Inform the ribald Steno, that his words"
18134,ACT V.,"Ne'er weighed in mind with Loredano's daughter,                    410"
18135,ACT V.,Further than to create a moment's pity
18136,ACT V.,For such as he is: would that others had
18137,ACT V.,Despised him as I pity! I prefer
18138,ACT V.,"My honour to a thousand lives, could such"
18139,ACT V.,"Be multiplied in mine, but would not have"
18140,ACT V.,A single life of others lost for that
18141,ACT V.,Which nothing human can impugn--the sense
18142,ACT V.,"Of Virtue, looking not to what is called"
18143,ACT V.,"A good name for reward, but to itself."
18144,ACT V.,To me the scorner's words were as the wind                         420
18145,ACT V.,Unto the rock: but as there are--alas!
18146,ACT V.,"Spirits more sensitive, on which such things"
18147,ACT V.,Light as the Whirlwind on the waters; souls
18148,ACT V.,To whom Dishonour's shadow is a substance
18149,ACT V.,"More terrible than Death, here and hereafter;"
18150,ACT V.,"Men whose vice is to start at Vice's scoffing,"
18151,ACT V.,"And who, though proof against all blandishments"
18152,ACT V.,"Of pleasure, and all pangs of Pain, are feeble"
18153,ACT V.,When the proud name on which they pinnacled
18154,ACT V.,"Their hopes is breathed on, jealous as the eagle                   430"
18155,ACT V.,Of her high aiery;[459] let what we now[fj]
18156,ACT V.,"Behold, and feel, and suffer, be a lesson"
18157,ACT V.,To wretches how they tamper in their spleen
18158,ACT V.,With beings of a higher order. Insects
18159,ACT V.,Have made the lion mad ere now; a shaft
18160,ACT V.,I' the heel o'erthrew the bravest of the brave;
18161,ACT V.,A wife's Dishonour was the bane of Troy;
18162,ACT V.,A wife's Dishonour unkinged Rome for ever;
18163,ACT V.,"An injured husband brought the Gauls to Clusium,"
18164,ACT V.,"And thence to Rome, which perished for a time;                     440"
18165,ACT V.,An obscene gesture cost Caligula[460]
18166,ACT V.,"His life, while Earth yet bore his cruelties;"
18167,ACT V.,A virgin's wrong made Spain a Moorish province;
18168,ACT V.,"And Steno's lie, couched in two worthless lines,"
18169,ACT V.,"Hath decimated Venice, put in peril"
18170,ACT V.,"A Senate which hath stood eight hundred years,"
18171,ACT V.,"Discrowned a Prince, cut off his crownless head,"
18172,ACT V.,And forged new fetters for a groaning people!
18173,ACT V.,"Let the poor wretch, like to the courtesan[461]"
18174,ACT V.,"Who fired Persepolis, be proud of this,                            450"
18175,ACT V.,If it so please him--'twere a pride fit for him!
18176,ACT V.,But let him not insult the last hours of
18177,ACT V.,"Him, who, whate'er he now is, _was_ a Hero,"
18178,ACT V.,By the intrusion of his very prayers;
18179,ACT V.,"Nothing of good can come from such a source,"
18180,ACT V.,"Nor would we aught with him, nor now, nor ever:"
18181,ACT V.,"We leave him to himself, that lowest depth"
18182,ACT V.,"Of human baseness. Pardon is for men,"
18183,ACT V.,"And not for reptiles--we have none for Steno,"
18184,ACT V.,"And no resentment: things like him must sting,                     460"
18185,ACT V.,And higher beings suffer; 'tis the charter
18186,ACT V.,Of Life. The man who dies by the adder's fang
18187,ACT V.,"May have the crawler crushed, but feels no anger:"
18188,ACT V.,'Twas the worm's nature; and some men are worms
18189,ACT V.,"In soul, more than the living things of tombs.[462]"
18190,ACT V.,
18191,ACT V.,_Doge_ (_to Ben._).
18192,ACT V.,Signor! complete that which you deem your duty.[fk]
18193,ACT V.,
18194,ACT V.,"_Ben_. Before we can proceed upon that duty,"
18195,ACT V.,We would request the Princess to withdraw;
18196,ACT V.,'Twill move her too much to be witness to it.
18197,ACT V.,
18198,ACT V.,"_Ang_. I know it will, and yet I must endure it,                   470"
18199,ACT V.,"For 'tis a part of mine--I will not quit,"
18200,ACT V.,"Except by force, my husband's side--Proceed!"
18201,ACT V.,"Nay, fear not either shriek, or sigh, or tear;"
18202,ACT V.,"Though my heart burst, it shall be silent.--Speak!"
18203,ACT V.,I have that within which shall o'ermaster all.
18204,ACT V.,
18205,ACT V.,"_Ben_. Marino Faliero, Doge of Venice,"
18206,ACT V.,"Count of Val di Marino, Senator,"
18207,ACT V.,"And some time General of the Fleet and Army,"
18208,ACT V.,"Noble Venetian, many times and oft"
18209,ACT V.,"Intrusted by the state with high employments,                      480"
18210,ACT V.,"Even to the highest, listen to the sentence."
18211,ACT V.,"Convict by many witnesses and proofs,"
18212,ACT V.,"And by thine own confession, of the guilt"
18213,ACT V.,"Of Treachery and Treason, yet unheard of[fl]"
18214,ACT V.,Until this trial--the decree is Death--
18215,ACT V.,"Thy goods are confiscate unto the State,"
18216,ACT V.,"Thy name is razed from out her records, save"
18217,ACT V.,Upon a public day of thanksgiving
18218,ACT V.,"For this our most miraculous deliverance,[fm]"
18219,ACT V.,When thou art noted in our calendars                               490
18220,ACT V.,"With earthquakes, pestilence, and foreign foes,"
18221,ACT V.,"And the great Enemy of man, as subject"
18222,ACT V.,Of grateful masses for Heaven's grace in snatching
18223,ACT V.,Our lives and country from thy wickedness.
18224,ACT V.,The place wherein as Doge thou shouldst be painted
18225,ACT V.,"With thine illustrious predecessors, is"
18226,ACT V.,"To be left vacant, with a death-black veil"
18227,ACT V.,"Flung over these dim words engraved beneath,--"
18228,ACT V.,"""This place is of Marino Faliero,"
18229,ACT V.,"Decapitated for his crimes.""[463]"
18230,ACT V.,
18231,ACT V.,"_Doge_.                         ""His _crimes_!""[464]500"
18232,ACT V.,But let it be so:--it will be in vain.
18233,ACT V.,"The veil which blackens o'er this blighted name,"
18234,ACT V.,"And hides, or seems to hide, these lineaments,"
18235,ACT V.,Shall draw more gazers than the thousand portraits
18236,ACT V.,Which glitter round it in their pictured trappings--
18237,ACT V.,_Your_ delegated slaves--the people's tyrants!
18238,ACT V.,"""Decapitated for his crimes!""--_What_ crimes?"
18239,ACT V.,"Were it not better to record the facts,"
18240,ACT V.,"So that the contemplator might approve,"
18241,ACT V.,Or at the least learn _whence_ the crimes arose?                   510
18242,ACT V.,"When the beholder knows a Doge conspired,"
18243,ACT V.,Let him be told the cause--it is your history.
18244,ACT V.,
18245,ACT V.,_Ben_. Time must reply to that; our sons will judge
18246,ACT V.,"Their fathers' judgment, which I now pronounce."
18247,ACT V.,"As Doge, clad in the ducal robes and Cap,"
18248,ACT V.,"Thou shalt be led hence to the Giants' Staircase,"
18249,ACT V.,Where thou and all our Princes are invested;
18250,ACT V.,"And there, the Ducal Crown being first resumed"
18251,ACT V.,"Upon the spot where it was first assumed,"
18252,ACT V.,Thy head shall be struck off; and Heaven have mercy                520
18253,ACT V.,Upon thy soul!
18254,ACT V.,
18255,ACT V.,_Doge_.          Is this the Giunta's sentence?
18256,ACT V.,
18257,ACT V.,_Ben_. It is.
18258,ACT V.,
18259,ACT V.,_Doge_.       I can endure it.--And the time?
18260,ACT V.,
18261,ACT V.,_Ben_. Must be immediate.--Make thy peace with God:
18262,ACT V.,Within an hour thou must be in His presence.
18263,ACT V.,
18264,ACT V.,_Doge_. I am _already_; and my blood will rise
18265,ACT V.,To Heaven before the souls of those who shed it.
18266,ACT V.,Are all my lands confiscated?[465]
18267,ACT V.,
18268,ACT V.,_Ben_.                         They are;
18269,ACT V.,"And goods, and jewels, and all kind of treasure,"
18270,ACT V.,Except two thousand ducats--these dispose of.
18271,ACT V.,
18272,ACT V.,_Doge_. That's harsh.--I would have fain reserved the lands        530
18273,ACT V.,"Near to Treviso, which I hold by investment"
18274,ACT V.,"From Laurence the Count-bishop of Ceneda,[fn]"
18275,ACT V.,"In fief perpetual to myself and heirs,"
18276,ACT V.,"To portion them (leaving my city spoil,"
18277,ACT V.,"My palace and my treasures, to your forfeit)"
18278,ACT V.,Between my consort and my kinsmen.
18279,ACT V.,
18280,ACT V.,_Ben_.                               These
18281,ACT V.,"Lie under the state's ban--their Chief, thy nephew,"
18282,ACT V.,In peril of his own life; but the Council
18283,ACT V.,Postpones his trial for the present. If
18284,ACT V.,"Thou will'st a state unto thy widowed Princess,                    540"
18285,ACT V.,"Fear not, for we will do her justice."
18286,ACT V.,
18287,ACT V.,"_Ang_.                                 Signors,"
18288,ACT V.,"I share not in your spoil! From henceforth, know"
18289,ACT V.,"I am devoted unto God alone,"
18290,ACT V.,And take my refuge in the cloister.
18291,ACT V.,
18292,ACT V.,_Doge_.                             Come!
18293,ACT V.,"The hour may be a hard one, but 'twill end."
18294,ACT V.,Have I aught else to undergo save Death?[fo]
18295,ACT V.,
18296,ACT V.,"_Ben_. You have nought to do, except confess and die."
18297,ACT V.,"The priest is robed, the scimitar is bare,"
18298,ACT V.,"And both await without.--But, above all,"
18299,ACT V.,Think not to speak unto the people; they                           550
18300,ACT V.,"Are now by thousands swarming at the gates,"
18301,ACT V.,"But these are closed: the Ten, the Avogadori,"
18302,ACT V.,"The Giunta, and the chief men of the Forty,"
18303,ACT V.,"Alone will be beholders of thy doom,"
18304,ACT V.,And they are ready to attend the Doge.
18305,ACT V.,
18306,ACT V.,_Doge_. The Doge!
18307,ACT V.,
18308,ACT V.,"_Ben_.           Yes, Doge, thou hast lived and thou shalt die"
18309,ACT V.,A Sovereign; till the moment which precedes
18310,ACT V.,"The separation of that head and trunk,"
18311,ACT V.,That ducal crown and head shall be united.
18312,ACT V.,Thou hast forgot thy dignity in deigning                           560
18313,ACT V.,"To plot with petty traitors; not so we,"
18314,ACT V.,Who in the very punishment acknowledge
18315,ACT V.,The Prince. Thy vile accomplices have died
18316,ACT V.,"The dog's death, and the wolf's; but them shall fall"
18317,ACT V.,"As falls the lion by the hunters, girt"
18318,ACT V.,"By those who feel a proud compassion for thee,"
18319,ACT V.,And mourn even the inevitable death
18320,ACT V.,"Provoked by thy wild wrath, and regal fierceness."
18321,ACT V.,Now we remit thee to thy preparation:
18322,ACT V.,"Let it be brief, and we ourselves will be                          570"
18323,ACT V.,Thy guides unto the place where first we were
18324,ACT V.,"United to thee as thy subjects, and"
18325,ACT V.,Thy Senate; and must now be parted from thee
18326,ACT V.,"As such for ever, on the self-same spot."
18327,ACT V.,Guards! form the Doge's escort to his chamber.
18328,ACT V.,[_Exeunt_.
18329,ACT V.,
18330,ACT V.,
18331,ACT V.,SCENE II.--_The Doge's Apartment_.
18332,ACT V.,
18333,ACT V.,"_The_ DOGE _as Prisoner, and the_ DUCHESS _attending him_."
18334,ACT V.,
18335,ACT V.,"_Doge_. Now, that the priest is gone, 'twere useless all"
18336,ACT V.,To linger out the miserable minutes;
18337,ACT V.,"But one pang more, the pang of parting from thee,"
18338,ACT V.,"And I will leave the few last grains of sand,"
18339,ACT V.,"Which yet remain of the accorded hour,"
18340,ACT V.,Still falling--I have done with Time.
18341,ACT V.,
18342,ACT V.,_Ang_.                                Alas!
18343,ACT V.,"And I have been the cause, the unconscious cause;"
18344,ACT V.,"And for this funeral marriage, this black union,"
18345,ACT V.,"Which thou, compliant with my father's wish,"
18346,ACT V.,"Didst promise at _his_ death, thou hast sealed thine own.           10"
18347,ACT V.,
18348,ACT V.,_Doge_. Not so: there was that in my spirit ever
18349,ACT V.,Which shaped out for itself some great reverse;
18350,ACT V.,"The marvel is, it came not until now--"
18351,ACT V.,And yet it was foretold me.
18352,ACT V.,
18353,ACT V.,_Ang_.                      How foretold you?
18354,ACT V.,
18355,ACT V.,"_Doge_. Long years ago--so long, they are a doubt[466]"
18356,ACT V.,"In memory, and yet they live in annals:"
18357,ACT V.,"When I was in my youth, and served the Senate"
18358,ACT V.,And Signory as Podesta and Captain
18359,ACT V.,"Of the town of Treviso, on a day"
18360,ACT V.,"Of festival, the sluggish Bishop who                                20"
18361,ACT V.,"Conveyed the Host aroused my rash young anger,"
18362,ACT V.,"By strange delay, and arrogant reply"
18363,ACT V.,"To my reproof: I raised my hand and smote him,"
18364,ACT V.,Until he reeled beneath his holy burthen;[fp]
18365,ACT V.,"And as he rose from earth again, he raised"
18366,ACT V.,His tremulous hands in pious wrath towards Heaven.
18367,ACT V.,"Thence pointing to the Host, which had fallen from him,"
18368,ACT V.,"He turned to me, and said, ""The Hour will come"
18369,ACT V.,When he thou hast o'erthrown shall overthrow thee:
18370,ACT V.,"The Glory shall depart from out thy house,                          30"
18371,ACT V.,"The Wisdom shall be shaken from thy soul,"
18372,ACT V.,And in thy best maturity of Mind
18373,ACT V.,A madness of the heart shall seize upon thee;[fq]
18374,ACT V.,Passion shall tear thee when all passions cease
18375,ACT V.,"In other men, or mellow into virtues;"
18376,ACT V.,"And Majesty which decks all other heads,"
18377,ACT V.,Shall crown to leave thee headless; honours shall
18378,ACT V.,"But prove to thee the heralds of Destruction,"
18379,ACT V.,"And hoary hairs of Shame, and both of Death,"
18380,ACT V.,"But not such death as fits an agéd man.""40"
18381,ACT V.,"Thus saying, he passed on.--That Hour is come."
18382,ACT V.,
18383,ACT V.,_Ang_. And with this warning couldst thou not have striven
18384,ACT V.,"To avert the fatal moment, and atone,"
18385,ACT V.,"By penitence, for that which thou hadst done?"
18386,ACT V.,
18387,ACT V.,"_Doge_. I own the words went to my heart, so much"
18388,ACT V.,That I remembered them amid the maze
18389,ACT V.,"Of Life, as if they formed a spectral voice,"
18390,ACT V.,Which shook me in a supernatural dream;
18391,ACT V.,And I repented; but 'twas not for me
18392,ACT V.,To pull in resolution:[467] what must be                            50
18393,ACT V.,"I could not change, and would not fear.--Nay more,"
18394,ACT V.,"Thou can'st not have forgot, what all remember,"
18395,ACT V.,"That on my day of landing here as Doge,[468]"
18396,ACT V.,"On my return from Rome, a mist of such"
18397,ACT V.,Unwonted density went on before
18398,ACT V.,"The Bucentaur, like the columnar cloud"
18399,ACT V.,"Which ushered Israel out of Egypt, till"
18400,ACT V.,"The pilot was misled, and disembarked us"
18401,ACT V.,"Between the Pillars of Saint Mark's, where 'tis"
18402,ACT V.,The custom of the state to put to death                             60
18403,ACT V.,"Its criminals, instead of touching at"
18404,ACT V.,"The Riva della Paglia, as the wont is,--"
18405,ACT V.,So that all Venice shuddered at the omen.
18406,ACT V.,
18407,ACT V.,_Ang_. Ah! little boots it now to recollect
18408,ACT V.,Such things.
18409,ACT V.,
18410,ACT V.,_Doge_.      And yet I find a comfort in
18411,ACT V.,"The thought, that these things are the work of Fate;"
18412,ACT V.,"For I would rather yield to Gods than men,"
18413,ACT V.,"Or cling to any creed of destiny,"
18414,ACT V.,"Rather than deem these mortals, most of whom[fr]"
18415,ACT V.,"I know to be as worthless as the dust,                              70"
18416,ACT V.,"And weak as worthless, more than instruments"
18417,ACT V.,Of an o'er-ruling Power; they in themselves
18418,ACT V.,Were all incapable--they could not be
18419,ACT V.,Vistors of him who oft had conquered for them.
18420,ACT V.,
18421,ACT V.,_Ang_. Employ the minutes left in aspirations
18422,ACT V.,"Of a more healing nature, and in peace"
18423,ACT V.,Even with these wretches take thy flight to Heaven.
18424,ACT V.,
18425,ACT V.,_Doge_. I _am_ at peace: the peace of certainty
18426,ACT V.,"That a sure Hour will come, when their sons' sons,"
18427,ACT V.,"And this proud city, and these azure waters,                        80"
18428,ACT V.,"And all which makes them eminent and bright,"
18429,ACT V.,"Shall be a desolation and a curse,"
18430,ACT V.,"A hissing and a scoff unto the nations,"
18431,ACT V.,"A Carthage, and a Tyre, an Ocean Babel."
18432,ACT V.,
18433,ACT V.,_Ang_. Speak not thus now: the surge of Passion still
18434,ACT V.,Sweeps o'er thee to the last; thou dost deceive
18435,ACT V.,"Thyself, and canst not injure them--be calmer."
18436,ACT V.,
18437,ACT V.,"_Doge_. I stand within Eternity, and see"
18438,ACT V.,"Into Eternity, and I behold--"
18439,ACT V.,"Aye, palpable as I see thy sweet face                               90"
18440,ACT V.,For the last time--the days which I denounce
18441,ACT V.,"Unto all time against these wave-girt walls,"
18442,ACT V.,And they who are indwellers.
18443,ACT V.,
18444,ACT V.,"_Guard_ (_coming forward_).   Doge of Venice,"
18445,ACT V.,The Ten are in attendance on your Highness.
18446,ACT V.,
18447,ACT V.,"_Doge_. Then farewell, Angiolina!--one embrace--"
18448,ACT V.,Forgive the old man who hath been to thee
18449,ACT V.,A fond but fatal husband--love my memory--
18450,ACT V.,"I would not ask so much for me still living,"
18451,ACT V.,"But thou canst judge of me more kindly now,"
18452,ACT V.,Seeing my evil feelings are at rest.                               100
18453,ACT V.,"Besides, of all the fruit of these long years,"
18454,ACT V.,"Glory, and Wealth, and Power, and Fame, and Name,"
18455,ACT V.,Which generally leave some flowers to bloom
18456,ACT V.,"Even o'er the grave, I have nothing left, not even"
18457,ACT V.,"A little love, or friendship, or esteem,"
18458,ACT V.,"No, not enough to extract an epitaph"
18459,ACT V.,From ostentatious kinsmen; in one hour
18460,ACT V.,"I have uprooted all my former life,"
18461,ACT V.,"And outlived everything, except thy heart,"
18462,ACT V.,"The pure, the good, the gentle, which will oft                     110"
18463,ACT V.,With unimpaired but not a clamorous grief[fs]
18464,ACT V.,"Still keep----Thou turn'st so pale!--Alas! she faints,"
18465,ACT V.,"She has no breath, no pulse!--Guards! lend your aid--"
18466,ACT V.,"I cannot leave her thus, and yet 'tis better,"
18467,ACT V.,Since every lifeless moment spares a pang.
18468,ACT V.,"When she shakes off this temporary death,"
18469,ACT V.,I shall be with the Eternal.--Call her women--
18470,ACT V.,One look!--how cold her hand!--as cold as mine
18471,ACT V.,"Shall be ere she recovers.--Gently tend her,"
18472,ACT V.,And take my last thanks--I am ready now.                           120
18473,ACT V.,
18474,ACT V.,"[_The Attendants of_ ANGIOLINA _enter, and surround"
18475,ACT V.,"their Mistress, who has fainted.--Exeunt the_ DOGE,"

18482,ACT V.,"attended by the Guards, till they arrive at the top of the"
18483,ACT V.,"""Giants' Staircase[469] (where the Doges took the oaths); the"
18484,ACT V.,"the Executioner is stationed there with his sword.--On arriving, a_"
18485,ACT V.,CHIEF OF THE TEN _takes off the ducal cap from the Doge's head_.
18486,ACT V.,
18487,ACT V.,"_Doge_. So now the Doge is nothing, and at last"
18488,ACT V.,I am again Marino Faliero:
18489,ACT V.,"'Tis well to be so, though but for a moment,[ft]"
18490,ACT V.,"Here was I crowned, and here, bear witness, Heaven!"
18491,ACT V.,With how much more contentment I resign
18492,ACT V.,"That shining mockery, the ducal bauble,"
18493,ACT V.,Than I received the fatal ornament.
18494,ACT V.,
18495,ACT V.,"_One of the Ten_. Thou tremblest, Faliero!"
18496,ACT V.,
18497,ACT V.,"_Doge_.                                    'Tis with age, then.[470]"

18501,ACT V.,
18502,ACT V.,"_Doge_. I would commend my nephew to their mercy,"
18503,ACT V.,My consort to their justice; for methinks
18504,ACT V.,"My death, and such a death, might settle all"
18505,ACT V.,Between the State and me.
18506,ACT V.,
18507,ACT V.,_Ben_.                    They shall be cared for;
18508,ACT V.,Even notwithstanding thine unheard-of crime.
18509,ACT V.,
18510,ACT V.,"_Doge_. Unheard of! aye, there's not a history"
18511,ACT V.,But shows a thousand crowned conspirators
18512,ACT V.,"_Against_ the people; but to set them free,"
18513,ACT V.,"One Sovereign only died, and one is dying."
18514,ACT V.,
18515,ACT V.,_Ben_. And who were they who fell in such a cause?                  20
18516,ACT V.,
18517,ACT V.,"_Doge_. The King of Sparta, and the Doge of Venice--"
18518,ACT V.,Agis and Faliero!
18519,ACT V.,
18520,ACT V.,_Ben_.           Hast thou more
18521,ACT V.,To utter or to do?
18522,ACT V.,
18523,ACT V.,_Doge_.            May I speak?
18524,ACT V.,
18525,ACT V.,_Ben_.                         Thou may'st;
18526,ACT V.,"But recollect the people are without,"
18527,ACT V.,Beyond the compass of the human voice.
18528,ACT V.,
18529,ACT V.,"_Doge_. I speak to Time and to Eternity,"
18530,ACT V.,"Of which I grow a portion, not to man."
18531,ACT V.,Ye Elements! in which to be resolved
18532,ACT V.,"I hasten, let my voice be as a Spirit"
18533,ACT V.,Upon you! Ye blue waves! which bore my banner.                      30
18534,ACT V.,"Ye winds! which fluttered o'er as if you loved it,"

18541,ACT V.,"Thou Sun! which shinest on these things, and Thou!"
18542,ACT V.,Who kindlest and who quenchest suns!--Attest![fu]

20142,NOTE A.,"Story of Marino Faliero, Doge XLIV. mcccliv.[483a]"
20143,NOTE A.,
20144,NOTE A.,
20145,NOTE A.,"On the eleventh day of September, in the year of our Lord, 1354, Marino"
20146,NOTE A.,Faliero was elected and chosen to be the Duke of the Commonwealth of
20147,NOTE A.,"Venice. He was Count of Valdemarino, in the Marches of Treviso, and a"
20148,NOTE A.,"Knight, and a wealthy man to boot. As soon as the election was"
20149,NOTE A.,"completed, it was resolved in the Great Council, that a deputation of"
20150,NOTE A.,"twelve should be despatched to Marino Faliero the Duke, who was then on"
20151,NOTE A.,"his way from Rome; for when he was chosen, he was ambassador at the"
20152,NOTE A.,"court of the Holy Father, at Rome,--the Holy Father himself held his"
20153,NOTE A.,court at Avignon. When Messer Marino Faliero the Duke was about to land
20154,NOTE A.,"in this city, on the 5th day of October, 1354, a thick haze came on and"
20155,NOTE A.,darkened the air: and he was enforced to land on the place of Saint
20156,NOTE A.,"Mark, between the two columns, on the spot where evil doers are put to"
20157,NOTE A.,death; and all thought that this was the worst of tokens.--Nor must I
20158,NOTE A.,forget to write that which I have read in a chronicle.--When Messer
20159,NOTE A.,"Marino Faliero was Podesta and Captain of Treviso, the Bishop delayed"
20160,NOTE A.,"coming in with the holy sacrament, on a day when a procession was to"
20161,NOTE A.,"take place. Now, the said Marino Faliero was so very proud and wrathful,"
20162,NOTE A.,"that he buffeted the Bishop, and almost struck him to the ground: and,"
20163,NOTE A.,"therefore, Heaven allowed Marino Faliero to go out of his right senses,"
20164,NOTE A.,in order that he might bring himself to an evil death.
20165,NOTE A.,
20166,NOTE A.,"When this Duke had held the dukedom during nine months and six days, he,"
20167,NOTE A.,"being wicked and ambitious, sought to make himself Lord of Venice, in"
20168,NOTE A.,the manner which I have read in an ancient chronicle. When the Thursday
20169,NOTE A.,"arrived upon which they were wont to hunt the bull, the bull hunt took"
20170,NOTE A.,"place as usual; and, according to the usage of those times, after the"
20171,NOTE A.,"bull hunt had ended, they all proceeded unto the palace of the Duke, and"
20172,NOTE A.,assembled together in one of his halls; and they disported themselves
20173,NOTE A.,"with the women. And until the first bell tolled they danced, and then a"
20174,NOTE A.,"banquet was served up. My Lord the Duke paid the expenses thereof,"
20175,NOTE A.,"provided he had a Duchess, and after the banquet they all returned to"
20176,NOTE A.,their homes.
20177,NOTE A.,
20178,NOTE A.,"Now to this feast there came a certain Ser Michele Steno, a gentleman of"
20179,NOTE A.,"poor estate and very young, but crafty and daring, and who loved one of"
20180,NOTE A.,the damsels of the Duchess. Ser Michele stood amongst the women upon the
20181,NOTE A.,"solajo; and he behaved indiscreetly, so that my Lord the Duke ordered"
20182,NOTE A.,that he should be kicked off the solajo [i.e. platform]; and the
20183,NOTE A.,esquires of the Duke flung him down from the solajo accordingly. Ser
20184,NOTE A.,Michele thought that such an affront was beyond all bearing; and when
20185,NOTE A.,"the feast was over, and all other persons had left the palace, he,"
20186,NOTE A.,"continuing heated with anger, went to the hall of audience, and wrote"
20187,NOTE A.,certain unseemly words relating to the Duke and the Duchess upon the
20188,NOTE A.,chair in which the Duke was used to sit; for in those days the Duke did
20189,NOTE A.,"not cover his chair with cloth of sendal, but he sat in a chair of wood."
20190,NOTE A.,"Ser Michele wrote thereon--""_Marin Falier, the husband of the fair wife;"
20191,NOTE A.,"others kiss her, but he keeps her._""[484] In the morning the words were"
20192,NOTE A.,"seen, and the matter was considered to be very scandalous; and the"
20193,NOTE A.,Senate commanded the Avogadori of the Commonwealth to proceed therein
20194,NOTE A.,with the greatest diligence. A largess of great amount was immediately
20195,NOTE A.,"proffered by the Avogadori, in order to discover who had written these"
20196,NOTE A.,words. And at length it was known that Michele Steno had written them.
20197,NOTE A.,It was resolved in the Council of Forty that he should be arrested; and
20198,NOTE A.,"he then confessed that in the fit of vexation and spite, occasioned by"
20199,NOTE A.,"his being thrust off the solajo in the presence of his mistress, he had"
20200,NOTE A.,written the words. Therefore the Council debated thereon. And the
20201,NOTE A.,"Council took his youth into consideration, and that he was a lover; and"
20202,NOTE A.,therefore they adjudged that he should be kept in close confinement
20203,NOTE A.,"during two months, and that afterwards he should be banished from Venice"
20204,NOTE A.,and the state during one year. In consequence of this merciful sentence
20205,NOTE A.,"the Duke became exceedingly wroth, it appearing to him, that the Council"
20206,NOTE A.,had not acted in such a manner as was required by the respect due to his
20207,NOTE A.,ducal dignity; and he said that they ought to have condemned Ser Michele
20208,NOTE A.,"to be hanged by the neck, or at least to be banished for life."
20209,NOTE A.,
20210,NOTE A.,Now it was fated that my Lord Duke Marino was to have his head cut off.
20211,NOTE A.,"And as it is necessary when any effect is to be brought about, that the"
20212,NOTE A.,"cause of such effect must happen, it therefore came to pass, that on the"
20213,NOTE A.,"very day after sentence had been pronounced on Ser Michele Steno, being"
20214,NOTE A.,"the first day of Lent, a gentleman of the house of Barbara, a choleric"
20215,NOTE A.,"gentleman, went to the arsenal, and required certain things of the"
20216,NOTE A.,masters of the galleys. This he did in the presence of the Admiral of
20217,NOTE A.,"the arsenal, and he, bearing the request, answered, No, it cannot be"
20218,NOTE A.,"done. High words arose between the gentleman and the Admiral, and the"
20219,NOTE A.,gentleman struck him with his fist just above the eye; and as he
20220,NOTE A.,"happened to have a ring on his finger, the ring cut the Admiral and drew"
20221,NOTE A.,"blood. The Admiral, all bruised and bloody, ran straight to the Duke to"
20222,NOTE A.,"complain, and with the intent of praying him to inflict some heavy"
20223,NOTE A.,"punishment upon the gentleman of Cà Barbaro.--""What wouldst thou have me"
20224,NOTE A.,"do for thee?"" answered the Duke: ""think upon the shameful gibe which"
20225,NOTE A.,hath been written concerning me; and think on the manner in which they
20226,NOTE A.,"have punished that ribald Michele Steno, who wrote it; and see how the"
20227,NOTE A.,"Council of Forty respect our person.""--Upon this the Admiral answered,"
20228,NOTE A.,"""My Lord Duke, if you would wish to make yourself a prince, and to cut"
20229,NOTE A.,"all those cuckoldy gentlemen to pieces, I have the heart, if you do but"
20230,NOTE A.,"help me, to make you prince of all this state; and then you may punish"
20231,NOTE A.,"them all."" Hearing this, the Duke said, ""How can such a matter be"
20232,NOTE A.,"brought about?""--and so they discoursed thereon."
20233,NOTE A.,
20234,NOTE A.,"The Duke called for his nephew, Ser Bertuccio Faliero, who lived with"
20235,NOTE A.,"him in the palace, and they communed about this plot. And without"
20236,NOTE A.,"leaving the place, they sent for Philip Calendaro, a seaman of great"
20237,NOTE A.,"repute, and for Bertuccio Israello, who was exceedingly wily and"
20238,NOTE A.,"cunning. Then taking counsel among themselves, they agreed to call in"
20239,NOTE A.,"some others; and so, for several nights successively, they met with the"
20240,NOTE A.,Duke at home in his palace. And the following men were called in singly;
20241,NOTE A.,"to wit:--Niccolo Fagiuolo, Giovanni da Corfu, Stefano Fagiono, Niccolo"
20242,NOTE A.,"dalle Bende, Niccolo Biondo, and Stefano Trivisano.--It was concerted"
20243,NOTE A.,that sixteen or seventeen leaders should be stationed in various parts
20244,NOTE A.,"of the city, each being at the head of forty men, armed and prepared;"
20245,NOTE A.,but the followers were not to know their destination. On the appointed
20246,NOTE A.,"day they were to make affrays amongst themselves here and there, in"
20247,NOTE A.,order that the Duke might have a pretence for tolling the bells of San
20248,NOTE A.,Marco; these bells are never rung but by the order of the Duke. And at
20249,NOTE A.,"the sound of the bells, these sixteen or seventeen, with their"
20250,NOTE A.,"followers, were to come to San Marco, through the streets which open"
20251,NOTE A.,upon the Piazza. And when the noble and leading citizens should come
20252,NOTE A.,"into the Piazza, to know the cause of the riot, then the conspirators"
20253,NOTE A.,"were to cut them in pieces; and this work being finished, my Lord Marino"
20254,NOTE A.,Faliero the Duke was to be proclaimed the Lord of Venice. Things having
20255,NOTE A.,"been thus settled, they agreed to fulfil their intent on Wednesday, the"
20256,NOTE A.,"15th day of April, in the year 1355. So covertly did they plot, that no"
20257,NOTE A.,one ever dreamt of their machinations.
20258,NOTE A.,
20259,NOTE A.,"But the Lord, who hath always helped this most glorious city, and who,"
20260,NOTE A.,"loving its righteousness and holiness, hath never forsaken it, inspired"
20261,NOTE A.,"one Beltramo Bergamasco to be the cause of bringing the plot to light,"
20262,NOTE A.,"in the following manner. This Beltramo, who belonged to Ser Niccolo"
20263,NOTE A.,"Lioni of Santo Stefano, had heard a word or two of what was to take"
20264,NOTE A.,"place; and so, in the above-mentioned month of April, he went to the"
20265,NOTE A.,"house of the aforesaid Ser Niccolo Lioni, and told him all the"
20266,NOTE A.,"particulars of the plot. Ser Niccolo, when he heard all these things,"
20267,NOTE A.,"was struck dead, as it were, with affright. He heard all the"
20268,NOTE A.,particulars; and Beltramo prayed him to keep it all secret; and if he
20269,NOTE A.,"told Ser Niccolo, it was in order that Ser Niccolo might stop at home on"
20270,NOTE A.,"the 15th of April, and thus save his life. Beltramo was going, but Ser"
20271,NOTE A.,"Niccolo ordered his servants to lay hands upon him, and lock him up. Ser"
20272,NOTE A.,"Niccolo then went to the house of Messer Giovanni Gradenigo Nasoni, who"
20273,NOTE A.,"afterwards became Duke, and who also lived at Santo Stefano, and told"
20274,NOTE A.,"him all. The matter seemed to him to be of the very greatest importance,"
20275,NOTE A.,"as indeed it was; and they two went to the house of Ser Marco Cornaro,"
20276,NOTE A.,"who lived at San Felice; and, having spoken with him, they all three"
20277,NOTE A.,"then determined to go back to the house of Ser Niccolo Lioni, to examine"
20278,NOTE A.,"the said Beltramo; and having questioned him, and heard all that he had"
20279,NOTE A.,"to say, they left him in confinement. And then they all three went into"
20280,NOTE A.,"the sacristy of San Salvatore, and sent their men to summon the"
20281,NOTE A.,"Councillors, the Avogadori, the Capi de' Dieci, and those of the Great"
20282,NOTE A.,Council.
20283,NOTE A.,
20284,NOTE A.,"When all were assembled, the whole story was told to them. They were"
20285,NOTE A.,"struck dead, as it were, with affright. They determined to send for"
20286,NOTE A.,"Beltramo. He was brought in before them. They examined him, and"
20287,NOTE A.,"ascertained that the matter was true; and, although they were"
20288,NOTE A.,"exceedingly troubled, yet they determined upon their measures. And they"
20289,NOTE A.,"sent for the Capi de' Quarante, the Signori di Notte, the Capi de'"
20290,NOTE A.,"Sestieri, and the Cinque della Pace; and they were ordered to associate"
20291,NOTE A.,"to their men other good men and true, who were to proceed to the houses"
20292,NOTE A.,"of the ringleaders of the conspiracy, and secure them. And they secured"
20293,NOTE A.,"the foreman of the arsenal, in order that the conspirators might not do"
20294,NOTE A.,mischief. Towards nightfall they assembled in the palace. When they were
20295,NOTE A.,"assembled in the palace, they caused the gates of the quadrangle of the"
20296,NOTE A.,"palace to be shut. And they sent to the keeper of the Bell-tower, and"
20297,NOTE A.,forbade the tolling of the bells. All this was carried into effect. The
20298,NOTE A.,"before-mentioned conspirators were secured, and they were brought to the"
20299,NOTE A.,"palace; and, as the Council of Ten saw that the Duke was in the plot,"
20300,NOTE A.,they resolved that twenty of the leading men of the state should be
20301,NOTE A.,"associated to them, for the purpose of consultation and deliberation,"
20302,NOTE A.,but that they should not be allowed to ballot.
20303,NOTE A.,
20304,NOTE A.,"The counsellors were the following:--Ser Giovanni Mocenigo, of the"
20305,NOTE A.,"Sestiero of San Marco; Ser Almoro Veniero da Santa Marina, of the"
20306,NOTE A.,"Sestiero of Castello; Ser Tomaso Viadro, of the Sestiero of Canaregio;"
20307,NOTE A.,"Ser Giovanni Sanudo, of the Sestiero of Santa Croce; Ser Pietro"
20308,NOTE A.,"Trivisano, of the Sestiero of San Paolo; Ser Pantalione Barbo il Grando,"
20309,NOTE A.,of the Sestiero of Ossoduro. The Avogadori of the Commonwealth were
20310,NOTE A.,"Zufredo Morosini, and Ser Orio Pasqualigo; and these did not ballot."
20311,NOTE A.,"Those of the Council of Ten were Ser Giovanni Marcello, Ser Tomaso"
20312,NOTE A.,"Sanudo, and Ser Micheletto Dolfino, the heads of the aforesaid Council"
20313,NOTE A.,"of Ten. Ser Luca da Legge, and Ser Pietro da Mosto, inquisitors of the"
20314,NOTE A.,"aforesaid Council. And Ser Marco Polani, Ser Marino Veniero, Ser Lando"
20315,NOTE A.,"Lombardo, and Ser Nicoletto Trivisano, of Sant' Angelo."
20316,NOTE A.,
20317,NOTE A.,"Late in the night, just before the dawning, they chose a junta of"
20318,NOTE A.,"twenty noblemen of Venice from amongst the wisest, and the worthiest,"
20319,NOTE A.,"and the oldest. They were to give counsel, but not to ballot. And they"
20320,NOTE A.,"would not admit any one of Cà Faliero. And Niccolo Faliero, and another"
20321,NOTE A.,"Niccolo Faliero, of San Tomaso, were expelled from the Council, because"
20322,NOTE A.,they belonged to the family of the Doge. And this resolution of creating
20323,NOTE A.,the junta of twenty was much praised throughout the state. The following
20324,NOTE A.,"were the members of the junta of twenty:--Ser Marco Giustiniani,"
20325,NOTE A.,"Procuratore, Ser Andrea Erizzo, Procuratore, Ser Lionardo Giustiniani,"
20326,NOTE A.,"Procuratore, Ser Andrea Contarini, Ser Simone Dandolo, Ser Niccolo"
20327,NOTE A.,"Volpe, Ser Giovanni Loredano, Ser Marco Diedo, Ser Giovanni Gradenigo,"
20328,NOTE A.,"Ser Andrea Cornaro Cavaliere, Ser Marco Soranzo, Ser Rinieri du Mosto,"
20329,NOTE A.,"Ser Gazano Marcello, Ser Marino Morosini, Ser Stefano Belegno, Ser"
20330,NOTE A.,"Niccolo Lioni, Ser Filippo Orio, Ser Marco Trivisano, Ser Jacopo"
20331,NOTE A.,"Bragadino, Ser Giovanni Foscarini."
20332,NOTE A.,
20333,NOTE A.,These twenty were accordingly called in to the Council of Ten; and they
20334,NOTE A.,"sent for my Lord Marino Faliero, the Duke: and my Lord Marino was then"
20335,NOTE A.,"consorting in the palace with people of great estate, gentlemen, and"
20336,NOTE A.,"other good men, none of whom knew yet how the fact stood."
20337,NOTE A.,
20338,NOTE A.,"At the same time Bertuccio Israello, who, as one of the ringleaders, was"
20339,NOTE A.,"to head the conspirators in Santa Croce, was arrested and bound, and"
20340,NOTE A.,"brought before the Council. Zanello del Brin, Nicoletto di Rosa,"
20341,NOTE A.,"Nicoletto Alberto, and the Guardiaga, were also taken, together with"
20342,NOTE A.,"several seamen, and people of various ranks. These were examined, and"
20343,NOTE A.,the truth of the plot was ascertained.
20344,NOTE A.,
20345,NOTE A.,"On the 16th of April judgment was given in the Council of Ten, that"
20346,NOTE A.,Filippo Calendaro and Bertuccio Israello should be hanged upon the red
20347,NOTE A.,"pillars of the balcony of the palace, from which the Duke is wont to"
20348,NOTE A.,look at the bull hunt: and they were hanged with gags in their mouths.
20349,NOTE A.,
20350,NOTE A.,"The next day the following were condemned:--Niccolo Zuccuolo, Nicoletto"
20351,NOTE A.,"Blondo, Nicoletto Doro, Marco Giuda, Jacomello Dagolino, Nicoletto"
20352,NOTE A.,"Fidele, the son of Filippo Calendaro, Marco Torello, called Israello,"
20353,NOTE A.,"Stefano Trivisano, the money-changer of Santa Margherita, and Antonio"
20354,NOTE A.,"dalle Bende. These were all taken at Chiozza, for they were endeavouring"
20355,NOTE A.,"to escape. Afterwards, by virtue of the sentence which was passed upon"
20356,NOTE A.,"them in the Council of Ten, they were hanged on successive days; some"
20357,NOTE A.,"singly and some in couples, upon the columns of the palace, beginning"
20358,NOTE A.,"from the red columns, and so going onwards towards the canal. And other"
20359,NOTE A.,"prisoners were discharged, because, although they had been involved in"
20360,NOTE A.,"the conspiracy, yet they had not assisted in it; for they were given to"
20361,NOTE A.,"understand by some of the heads of the plot, that they were to come"
20362,NOTE A.,"armed and prepared for the service of the state, and in order to secure"
20363,NOTE A.,"certain criminals; and they knew nothing else. Nicoletto Alberto, the"
20364,NOTE A.,"Guardiaga, and Bartolommeo Ciricolo and his son, and several others, who"
20365,NOTE A.,"were not guilty, were discharged."
20366,NOTE A.,
20367,NOTE A.,"On Friday, the 16th day of April, judgment was also given in the"
20368,NOTE A.,"aforesaid Council of Ten, that my Lord Marino Faliero, the Duke, should"
20369,NOTE A.,have his head cut off; and that the execution should be done on the
20370,NOTE A.,"landing-place of the stone staircase, where the Dukes take their oath"
20371,NOTE A.,"when they first enter the palace. On the following day, the 17th of"
20372,NOTE A.,"April, the doors of the palace being shut, the Duke had his head cut"
20373,NOTE A.,"off, about the hour of noon. And the cap of estate was taken from the"
20374,NOTE A.,"Duke's head before he came down stairs. When the execution was over, it"
20375,NOTE A.,is said that one of the Council of Ten went to the columns of the palace
20376,NOTE A.,"over against the place of St. Mark, and that he showed the bloody sword"
20377,NOTE A.,"unto the people, crying out with a loud voice--""The terrible doom hath"
20378,NOTE A.,"fallen upon the traitor!""--and the doors were opened, and the people all"
20379,NOTE A.,"rushed in, to see the corpse of the Duke, who had been beheaded."
20380,NOTE A.,
20381,NOTE A.,"It must be known that Ser Giovanni Sanudo, the councillor, was not"
20382,NOTE A.,present when the aforesaid sentence was pronounced; because he was
20383,NOTE A.,unwell and remained at home. So that only fourteen balloted; that is to
20384,NOTE A.,"say, five councillors, and nine of the Council of Ten. And it was"
20385,NOTE A.,"adjudged, that all the lands and chattels of the Duke, as well as of the"
20386,NOTE A.,"other traitors, should be forfeited to the state. And as a grace to the"
20387,NOTE A.,"Duke, it was resolved in the Council of Ten, that he should be allowed"
20388,NOTE A.,to dispose of two thousand ducats out of his own property. And it was
20389,NOTE A.,"resolved, that all the councillors and all the Avogadori of the"
20390,NOTE A.,"Commonwealth, those of the Council of Ten, and the members of the junta,"
20391,NOTE A.,"who had assisted in passing sentence on the Duke and the other traitors,"
20392,NOTE A.,should have the privilege of carrying arms both by day and by night in
20393,NOTE A.,"Venice, and from Grado to Cavazere. And they were also to be allowed two"

20484,NOTE B.,"That Petrarch thought that he had more courage than conduct, ""più di"
20485,NOTE B.,"_coraggio_ che di senno."" 3dly, That there was some jealousy on the part"
20486,NOTE B.,of Petrarch; for he says that Marino Faliero was treating of the peace
20487,NOTE B.,"which he himself had ""vainly attempted to conclude."" 4thly, That the"
20488,NOTE B.,"honour of the Dukedom was conferred upon him, which he neither sought"
20489,NOTE B.,"nor expected, ""che nè chiedeva, nè aspettava,"" and which had never been"
20490,NOTE B.,"granted to any other in like circumstances, ""ciò che non si concedette a"
20491,NOTE B.,"nessun altro,"" a proof of the high esteem in which he must have been"
20492,NOTE B.,"held. 5thly, That he had a reputation for _wisdom_, _only_ forfeited by"
20493,NOTE B.,"the last enterprise of his life, ""si usurpò per tanti anni una falsa"
20494,NOTE B.,"fama di sapienza.""--""He had usurped for so many years a false fame of"
20495,NOTE B.,"wisdom,"" rather a difficult task, I should think. People are generally"
20496,NOTE B.,"found out before eighty years of age, at least in a republic.--From"
20497,NOTE B.,"these, and the other historical notes which I have collected, it may be"
20498,NOTE B.,"inferred, that Marino Faliero possessed many of the qualities, but not"
20499,NOTE B.,the success of a hero; and that his passions were too violent. The
20500,NOTE B.,paltry and ignorant account of Dr. Moore falls to the ground. Petrarch
20501,NOTE B.,"says, ""that there had been no greater event in his times"" (_our times_"
20502,NOTE B.,"literally), ""nostri tempi,"" in Italy. He also differs from the historian"
20503,NOTE B.,"in saying that Faliero was ""on the banks of the _Rhone_,"" instead of at"
20504,NOTE B.,"Rome, when elected; the other accounts say, that the deputation of the"
20505,NOTE B.,"Venetian senate met him at Ravenna. How this may have been, it is not"
20506,NOTE B.,"for me to decide, and is of no great importance. Had the man succeeded,"

20531,NOTE C.,"country, than among those nations where the laws and religion admit of"
20532,NOTE C.,"its being dissolved. Because they could not break the contract, they"
20533,NOTE C.,"feigned that it had not existed; and the ground of nullity, immodestly"
20534,NOTE C.,"alleged by the married pair, was admitted with equal facility by priests"
20535,NOTE C.,"and magistrates, alike corrupt. These divorces, veiled under another"
20536,NOTE C.,"name, became so frequent, that the most important act of civil society"
20537,NOTE C.,was discovered to be amenable to a tribunal of exceptions; and to
20538,NOTE C.,restrain the open scandal of such proceedings became the office of the
20539,NOTE C.,"police. In 1782 the Council of Ten decreed, that every woman who should"

20544,NOTE C.,"having occasioned some remonstrance from Rome, the council retained only"
20545,NOTE C.,"the right of rejecting the petition of the married persons, and"

20554,NOTE C.,to reclaim and bring back good morals to a whole people brought up in
20555,NOTE C.,the most scandalous licentiousness. Depravity reached the very bosoms of

20559,NOTE C.,employed in the ruin of men whose fortunes might have rendered them
20560,NOTE C.,dangerous. Since that time licentiousness has gone on increasing; and we
20561,NOTE C.,"have seen mothers, not only selling the innocence of their daughters,"
20562,NOTE C.,"but selling it by a contract, authenticated by the signature of a public"

20833,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,"the _Courier_, January 6, 1822. His task was an easy one. He was able to"
20834,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,"deny, _in toto_, the charge of uttering calumnies on his return from"
20835,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,"Switzerland, and he was pleased to word his denial in a very"
20836,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,"disagreeable way. He had come home with a stock of travellers' tales,"
20837,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,"but not one of them was about Lord Byron. He had ""sought for no staler"

20843,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,
20844,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,"So far, the battle went in Southey's favour. ""The words of the men of"
20845,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,"Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel,"" and Byron was"
20846,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,"reduced to silence. A challenge (sent through Kinnaird, but not"
20847,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,"delivered) was but a confession of impotence. There was, however, in"
20848,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,Southey's letter to the _Courier_ just one sentence too many. Before he
20849,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,"concluded he had given ""one word of advice to Lord Byron""--""When he"

20853,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,
20854,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,"Byron had anticipated this advice, and had already attacked the laureate"

20872,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,his desire for publication; but in spite of many appeals and suggestions
20873,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,"to Murray, who had sent Byron's ""copy"" to his printer, the decisive step"
20874,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,of passing the proofs for press was never taken. At length Byron lost
20875,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,"patience, and desired Murray to hand over ""the corrected copy of the"

20877,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,"letters to Murray, July 3, 6, 1822, _Letters_, 1901, vi. 92, 93)."
20878,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,"Finally, a year after the MS. had been sent to England, the _Vision of"

20890,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,_Vision of Judgment_). The daily press was even more violent. The
20891,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,"_Courier_ for October 26 begins thus: ""This _scoundrel-like_ publication"

20893,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,
20894,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,There was even a threat of prosecution. Byron offered to employ counsel
20895,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,"for Hunt, to come over to England to stand his trial in his stead, and"
20896,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,"blamed Murray for not having handed over the corrected proof, in which"
20897,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,some of the more offensive passages had been omitted or mitigated (see

20899,INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.,"1823, _Letters,_ 1901, vi. 155, 159). It is to be noted that in the list"

20971,PREFACE,"If Mr. Southey had not rushed in where he had no business, and where he"
20972,PREFACE,"never was before, and never will be again, the following poem would not"
20973,PREFACE,have been written. It is not impossible that it may be as good as his
20974,PREFACE,"own, seeing that it cannot, by any species of stupidity, natural or"
20975,PREFACE,"acquired, be _worse._ The gross flattery, the dull impudence, the"
20976,PREFACE,"renegade intolerance, and impious cant, of the poem by the author of"
20977,PREFACE,"""Wat Tyler,"" are something so stupendous as to form the sublime of"
20978,PREFACE,himself--containing the quintessence of his own attributes.
20979,PREFACE,
20980,PREFACE,So much for his poem--a word on his preface. In this preface it has
20981,PREFACE,pleased the magnanimous Laureate to draw the picture of a supposed
20982,PREFACE,"""Satanic School,"" the which he doth recommend to the notice of the"
20983,PREFACE,legislature; thereby adding to his other laurels the ambition of those
20984,PREFACE,"of an informer. If there exists anywhere, except in his imagination,"
20985,PREFACE,"such a School, is he not sufficiently armed against it by his own"
20986,PREFACE,intense vanity? The truth is that there are certain writers whom Mr. S.
20987,PREFACE,"imagines, like Scrub, to have ""talked of _him_; for they laughed"
20988,PREFACE,"consumedly.""[492]"
20989,PREFACE,
20990,PREFACE,I think I know enough of most of the writers to whom he is supposed to
20991,PREFACE,"allude, to assert, that they, in their individual capacities, have done"
20992,PREFACE,"more good, in the charities of life, to their fellow-creatures, in any"
20993,PREFACE,"one year, than Mr. Southey has done harm to himself by his absurdities"
20994,PREFACE,in his whole life; and this is saying a great deal. But I have a few
20995,PREFACE,questions to ask.
20996,PREFACE,
20997,PREFACE,"1stly, Is Mr. Southey the author of _Wat Tyler_?"
20998,PREFACE,
20999,PREFACE,"2ndly, Was he not refused a remedy at law by the highest judge of his"
21000,PREFACE,"beloved England, because it was a blasphemous and seditious"
21001,PREFACE,publication?[493]
21002,PREFACE,
21003,PREFACE,"3rdly, Was he not entitled by William Smith, in full parliament, ""a"
21004,PREFACE,"rancorous renegado?""[494]"
21005,PREFACE,
21006,PREFACE,"4thly, Is he not poet laureate, with his own lines on Martin the"
21007,PREFACE,regicide staring him in the face?[495]
21008,PREFACE,
21009,PREFACE,"And, 5thly, Putting the four preceding items together, with what"
21010,PREFACE,conscience dare _he_ call the attention of the laws to the publications
21011,PREFACE,"of others, be they what they may?"
21012,PREFACE,
21013,PREFACE,I say nothing of the cowardice of such a proceeding; its meanness speaks
21014,PREFACE,"for itself; but I wish to touch upon the _motive_, which is neither more"
21015,PREFACE,nor less than that Mr. S. has been laughed at a little in some recent
21016,PREFACE,"publications, as he was of yore in the _Anti-jacobin_, by his present"
21017,PREFACE,"patrons. Hence all this ""skimble scamble stuff"" about ""Satanic,"" and so"
21018,PREFACE,"forth. However, it is worthy of him--""_qualis ab incepto_."""
21019,PREFACE,
21020,PREFACE,If there is anything obnoxious to the political opinions of a portion of
21021,PREFACE,"the public in the following poem, they may thank Mr. Southey. He might"
21022,PREFACE,"have written hexameters, as he has written everything else, for aught"
21023,PREFACE,that the writer cared--had they been upon another subject. But to
21024,PREFACE,"attempt to canonise a monarch, who, whatever were his household virtues,"
21025,PREFACE,"was neither a successful nor a patriot king,--inasmuch as several years"
21026,PREFACE,"of his reign passed in war with America and Ireland, to say nothing of"
21027,PREFACE,"the aggression upon France--like all other exaggeration, necessarily"
21028,PREFACE,begets opposition. In whatever manner he may be spoken of in this new
21029,PREFACE,"_Vision_, his _public_ career will not be more favourably transmitted by"
21030,PREFACE,history. Of his private virtues (although a little expensive to the
21031,PREFACE,nation) there can be no doubt.
21032,PREFACE,
21033,PREFACE,"With regard to the supernatural personages treated of, I can only say"
21034,PREFACE,"that I know as much about them, and (as an honest man) have a better"
21035,PREFACE,right to talk of them than Robert Southey. I have also treated them more
21036,PREFACE,"tolerantly. The way in which that poor insane creature, the Laureate,"
21037,PREFACE,"deals about his judgments in the next world, is like his own judgment in"
21038,PREFACE,"this. If it was not completely ludicrous, it would be something worse. I"
21039,PREFACE,don't think that there is much more to say at present.

25114,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,What a beautiful word!
25115,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25116,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Ink_.                Very true; 'tis so soft
25117,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,And so cooling--they use it a little too oft;
25118,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,And the papers have got it at last--but no matter.
25119,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,So they've cut up our friend then?
25120,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25121,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Tra_.                            Not left him a tatter--
25122,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"Not a rag of his present or past reputation,                        30"
25123,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"Which they call a disgrace to the age, and the nation."
25124,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25125,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"_Ink_. I'm sorry to hear this! for friendship, you know--"
25126,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,Our poor friend!--but I thought it would terminate so.
25127,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"Our friendship is such, I'll read nothing to shock it."
25128,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,You don't happen to have the Review in your pocket?
25129,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25130,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Tra_. No; I left a round dozen of authors and others
25131,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"(Very sorry, no doubt, since the cause is a brother's)"
25132,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"All scrambling and jostling, like so many imps,"
25133,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,And on fire with impatience to get the next glimpse.

25137,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"_Tra_.                  What, won't you return to the lecture?      40"
25138,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,

25140,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"Besides, our friend Scamp is to-day so absurd--[613]"

25144,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Ink_.                                          I heard
25145,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"Quite enough; and, to tell you the truth, my retreat"
25146,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"Was from his vile nonsense, no less than the heat."
25147,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25148,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Tra_. I have had no great loss then?
25149,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25150,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Ink_.                                Loss!--such a palaver!
25151,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,I'd inoculate sooner my wife with the slaver

25156,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25157,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Tra_. _I_ make you!
25158,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25159,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"_Ink_.                   Yes, you! I said nothing until"
25160,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"You compelled me, by speaking the truth----"

25163,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,Is that your deduction?
25164,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25165,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"_Ink_.                 When speaking of Scamp ill,"
25166,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"I certainly _follow, not set_ an example."
25167,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"The fellow's a fool, an impostor, a zany."
25168,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25169,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Tra_. And the crowd of to-day shows that one fool makes many.
25170,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,But we two will be wise.
25171,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25172,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"_Ink_.                  Pray, then, let us retire."
25173,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25174,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"_Tra_. I would, but----"
25175,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25176,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Ink_.                There must be attraction much higher

25181,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,A fair lady----
25182,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25183,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Ink_.       A spinster?

25192,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,Pray get out of this hobble as fast as you can.
25193,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_You_ wed with Miss Lilac! 'twould be your perdition:
25194,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"She's a poet, a chymist, a mathematician.[614]"
25195,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25196,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Tra_. I say she's an angel.
25197,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25198,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Ink_.                      Say rather an angle.
25199,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"If you and she marry, you'll certainly wrangle."
25200,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"I say she's a Blue, man, as blue as the ether."
25201,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25202,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Tra_. And is that any cause for not coming together?               70
25203,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25204,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Ink_. Humph! I can't say I know any happy alliance
25205,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,Which has lately sprung up from a wedlock with science.
25206,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"She's so learnéd in all things, and fond of concerning"

25210,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Tra_.  What?
25211,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25212,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Ink_.        I perhaps may as well hold my tongue;
25213,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,But there's five hundred people can tell you you're
25214,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,wrong.
25215,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25216,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Tra_. You forget Lady Lilac's as rich as a Jew.
25217,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25218,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Ink_. Is it miss or the cash of mamma you pursue?
25219,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25220,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"_Tra_. Why, Jack, I'll be frank with you--something of both."
25221,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,The girl's a fine girl.
25222,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25223,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Ink_.                 And you feel nothing loth                    80
25224,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,To her good lady-mother's reversion; and yet
25225,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"Her life is as good as your own, I will bet."
25226,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25227,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"_Tra_. Let her live, and as long as she likes; I demand"
25228,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,Nothing more than the heart of her daughter and hand.
25229,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25230,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"_Ink_. Why, that heart's in the inkstand--that hand on the pen."
25231,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25232,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Tra_. A propos--Will you write me a song now and then?
25233,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25234,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Ink_. To what purpose?
25235,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25236,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"_Tra_.                 You know, my dear friend, that in prose"
25237,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"My talent is decent, as far as it goes;"
25238,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,But in rhyme----
25239,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25240,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"_Ink_.         You're a terrible stick, to be sure."
25241,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25242,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"_Tra_. I own it; and yet, in these times, there's no lure           90"
25243,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,For the heart of the fair like a stanza or two;
25244,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"And so, as I can't, will you furnish a few?"
25245,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25246,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Ink_. In your name?
25247,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25248,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"_Tra_.               In my name. I will copy them out,"
25249,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,To slip into her hand at the very next rout.
25250,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25251,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Ink_. Are you so far advanced as to hazard this?
25252,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25253,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"_Tra_.                                            Why,"
25254,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"Do you think me subdued by a Blue-stocking's eye,"
25255,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,So far as to tremble to tell her in rhyme
25256,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"What I've told her in prose, at the least, as sublime?"
25257,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25258,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"_Ink_. _As sublime!_ If i be so, no need of my Muse."
25259,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25260,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"_Tra_. But consider, dear Inkel, she's one of the ""Blues.""100"
25261,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25262,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Ink_. As sublime!--Mr. Tracy--I've nothing to say.
25263,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,Stick to prose--As sublime!!--but I wish you good day.
25264,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25265,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"_Tra_. Nay, stay, my dear fellow--consider--I'm wrong;"
25266,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"I own it; but, prithee, compose me the song."
25267,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25268,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Ink_. _As_ sublime!!
25269,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25270,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Tra_.                 I but used the expression in haste.
25271,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25272,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"_Ink_. That may be, Mr. Tracy, but shows damned bad taste."
25273,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25274,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"_Tra_. I own it, I know it, acknowledge it--what"
25275,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,Can I say to you more?
25276,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25277,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Ink_.                 I see what you'd be at:
25278,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"You disparage my parts with insidious abuse,"
25279,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,Till you think you can turn them best to your own use.             110
25280,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25281,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Tra_. And is that not a sign I respect them?
25282,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25283,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Ink_.                                        Why that
25284,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,To be sure makes a difference.
25285,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25286,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Tra_.                        I know what is what:
25287,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"And you, who're a man of the gay world, no less"
25288,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"Than a poet of t'other, may easily guess"
25289,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"That I never could mean, by a word, to offend"
25290,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"A genius like you, and, moreover, my friend."
25291,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25292,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Ink_. No doubt; you by this time should know what is due
25293,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,To a man of----but come--let us shake hands.
25294,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25295,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"_Tra_.                                      You knew,"

25314,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25315,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Tra_. Make haste then.
25316,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25317,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Ink_.                  Why so?
25318,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25319,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Tra_.                         I have heard people say

25341,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25342,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Tra_. You should rather encourage my passion than shock it.
25343,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,But let us proceed; for I think by the hum----

25350,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,Aye! there he is at it. Poor Scamp! better join
25351,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,"Your friends, or he'll pay you back in your own coin."
25352,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,
25353,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Tra_. All fair; 'tis but lecture for lecture.

25355,ECLOGUE THE FIRST.,_Ink_.                                         That's clear.

25425,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,I obey.
25426,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25427,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Lady Blueb_. Mr. Inkel, I ought to upbraid ye:"
25428,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,You were not at the lecture.
25429,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25430,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Ink_.                      Excuse me, I was;"
25431,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,But the heat forced me out in the best part--alas!
25432,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,And when--
25433,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25434,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Lady Blueb_. To be sure it was broiling; but then
25435,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,You have lost such a lecture!
25436,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25437,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Both_.                      The best of the ten.
25438,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25439,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Tra_. How can you know that? there are two more.
25440,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25441,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Both_.                                          Because
25442,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,I defy him to beat this day's wondrous applause.
25443,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,The very walls shook.
25444,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25445,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Ink_.               Oh, if that be the test,                       40"
25446,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,I allow our friend Scamp has this day done his best.
25447,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"Miss Lilac, permit me to help you;--a wing?"
25448,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25449,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Miss Lil_. No more, sir, I thank you. Who lectures next spring?"
25450,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25451,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Both_. Dick Dunder.
25452,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25453,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Ink_.               That is, if he lives."
25454,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25455,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Miss Lil_.                               And why not?
25456,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25457,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Ink_. No reason whatever, save that he's a sot."
25458,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,Lady Bluemount! a glass of Madeira?
25459,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25460,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Lady Bluem_.                      With pleasure.
25461,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25462,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Ink_. How does your friend Wordswords, that Windermere treasure?"

25467,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25468,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Ink_.                                 As a footman?
25469,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25470,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Lady Bluem_.                                       For shame!
25471,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,Nor profane with your sneers so poetic a name.                      51
25472,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25473,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Ink_. Nay, I meant him no evil, but pitied his master;"
25474,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"For the poet of pedlers 'twere, sure, no disaster"

25477,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25478,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Lady Bluem_. For shame! I repeat. If Sir George could but hear--
25479,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25480,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Lady Blueb_. Never mind our friend Inkel; we all know, my dear,"
25481,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,'Tis his way.
25482,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25483,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Sir Rich_.    But this place--
25484,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25485,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Ink_.                          Is perhaps like friend Scamp's,"
25486,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,A lecturer's.
25487,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25488,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Lady Bluem_. Excuse me--'tis one in the ""Stamps:"""
25489,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,He is made a collector.
25490,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25491,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Tra_.                 Collector!
25492,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25493,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Sir Rich_.                       How?
25494,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25495,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Miss Lil_.                            What?                        60
25496,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25497,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Ink_. I shall think of him oft when I buy a new hat:
25498,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,There his works will appear--
25499,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25500,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Lady Bluem_.                Sir, they reach to the Ganges."
25501,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25502,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Ink_. I sha'n't go so far--I can have them at Grange's.[625]
25503,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25504,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Lady Bluem_. Oh fie!
25505,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25506,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Miss Lil_.          And for shame!
25507,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25508,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Lady Bluem_.                      You're too bad.
25509,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25510,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Both_.                                           Very good!
25511,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25512,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Lady Bluem_. How good?
25513,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25514,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Lady Blueb_.          He means nought--'tis his phrase.
25515,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25516,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Lady Bluem_.                                          He grows rude.
25517,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25518,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Lady Blueb_. He means nothing; nay, ask him."
25519,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25520,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Lady Bluem_.                                Pray, Sir! did you mean"
25521,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,What you say?
25522,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25523,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Ink_.        Never mind if he did; 'twill be seen
25524,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,That whatever he means won't alloy what he says.
25525,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25526,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Both_. Sir!
25527,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25528,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Ink_.      Pray be content with your portion of praise;
25529,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,'Twas in your defence.
25530,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25531,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Both_.               If you please, with submission                70"
25532,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,I can make out my own.
25533,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25534,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Ink_.                 It would be your perdition.
25535,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"While you live, my dear Botherby, never defend"
25536,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,Yourself or your works; but leave both to a friend.
25537,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,Apropos--Is your play then accepted at last?
25538,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25539,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Both_. At last?
25540,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25541,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Ink_. Why I thought--that's to say--there had passed
25542,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"A few green-room whispers, which hinted,--you know"
25543,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,That the taste of the actors at best is so so.[626]
25544,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25545,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Both_. Sir, the green-room's in rapture, and so's the Committee."
25546,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25547,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Ink_. Aye--yours are the plays for exciting our ""pity"
25548,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"And fear,"" as the Greek says: for ""purging the mind,""80"
25549,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,I doubt if you'll leave us an equal behind.
25550,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25551,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Both_. I have written the prologue, and meant to have prayed"
25552,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,For a spice of your wit in an epilogue's aid.
25553,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25554,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Ink_. Well, time enough yet, when the play's to be played."
25555,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,Is it cast yet?
25556,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25557,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Both_.         The actors are fighting for parts,"
25558,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,As is usual in that most litigious of arts.
25559,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25560,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Lady Blueb_. We'll all make a party, and go the _first_ night."
25561,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25562,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Tra_. And you promised the epilogue, Inkel."
25563,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25564,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Ink_.                                       Not quite.
25565,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"However, to save my friend Botherby trouble,"
25566,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"I'll do what I can, though my pains must be double.                 90"
25567,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25568,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Tra_. Why so?
25569,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25570,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Ink_.          To do justice to what goes before.
25571,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25572,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Both_. Sir, I'm happy to say, I've no fears on that score."
25573,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"Your parts, Mr. Inkel, are----"
25574,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25575,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Ink_.                    Never mind _mine_;
25576,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"Stick to those of your play, which is quite your own line."
25577,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25578,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Lady Bluem_. You're a fugitive writer, I think, sir, of rhymes?[627]"
25579,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25580,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Ink_. Yes, ma'am; and a fugitive reader sometimes."
25581,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"On Wordswords, for instance, I seldom alight,"
25582,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"Or on Mouthey, his friend, without taking to flight."
25583,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25584,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Lady Bluem_. Sir, your taste is too common; but time and posterity"
25585,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"Will right these great men, and this age's severity                100"
25586,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,Become its reproach.
25587,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25588,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Ink_.               I've no sort of objection,"
25589,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,So I'm not of the party to take the infection.
25590,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25591,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Lady Blueb_. Perhaps you have doubts that they ever will _take_?
25592,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25593,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Ink_. Not at all; on the contrary, those of the lake"
25594,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"Have taken already, and still will continue"
25595,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"To take--what they can, from a groat to a guinea,"
25596,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,Of pension or place;--but the subject's a bore.
25597,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25598,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Lady Bluem_. Well, sir, the time's coming."
25599,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25600,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Ink_.                                   Scamp! don't you feel sore?
25601,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,What say you to this?
25602,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25603,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Scamp_.             They have merit, I own;"
25604,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"Though their system's absurdity keeps it unknown,                  110"
25605,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25606,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Ink_. Then why not unearth it in one of your lectures?
25607,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25608,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Scamp_. It is only time past which comes under my strictures.
25609,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25610,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Lady Blueb_. Come, a truce with all tartness;--the joy of my heart"
25611,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,Is to see Nature's triumph o'er all that is art.
25612,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,Wild Nature!--Grand Shakespeare!
25613,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25614,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Both_.                         And down Aristotle!
25615,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25616,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Lady Bluem_. Sir George[628] thinks exactly with Lady Bluebottle:
25617,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"And my Lord Seventy-four,[629] who protects our dear Bard,"
25618,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"And who gave him his place, has the greatest regard"
25619,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"For the poet, who, singing of pedlers and asses,"

25622,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Tra_. And you, Scamp!--"
25623,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25624,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Scamp_.                I needs must confess I'm embarrassed.
25625,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25626,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Ink_. Don't call upon Scamp, who's already so harassed"
25627,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"With old _schools_, and new _schools_,"
25628,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"and no _schools_, and all _schools_[630]."
25629,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25630,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Tra_. Well, one thing is certain, that _some_ must be fools."
25631,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,I should like to know who.
25632,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25633,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Ink_.                   And I should not be sorry
25634,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,To know who are _not_:--it would save us some worry.
25635,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25636,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"_Lady Blueb_. A truce with remark, and let nothing control"

25644,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Tra_.                         I wish her much joy on't.

25647,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"This gentle emotion, so seldom our lot"

25649,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,Our spirits from earth--the sublimest of gifts;
25650,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,For which poor Prometheus was chained to his mountain:
25651,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,'Tis the source of all sentiment--feeling's true fountain;
25652,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,'Tis the Vision of Heaven upon Earth: 'tis the gas

25659,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25660,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Ink_. Apropos--Do you dine with Sir Humphry to day?
25661,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25662,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Tra_. I should think with _Duke_ Humphry[633] was more in your way.
25663,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,
25664,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Ink_. It might be of yore; but we authors now look
25665,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"To the Knight, as a landlord, much more than the Duke."
25666,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,"The truth is, each writer now quite at his ease is,"

25685,ECLOGUE THE SECOND.,_Tra_. And the sweet lobster salad![635]
