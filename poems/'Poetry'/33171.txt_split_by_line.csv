117,LATE SPRING,LATE SPRING
118,LATE SPRING,
119,LATE SPRING,_The mottled moth at eventide
120,LATE SPRING,Beats glimmering wings against the pane;
121,LATE SPRING,"The slow, sweet lily opens wide,"
122,LATE SPRING,White in the dusk like some dim stain;
123,LATE SPRING,The garden dreams on every side
124,LATE SPRING,And breathes faint scents of rain.
125,LATE SPRING,Among the flowering stocks they stand:
126,LATE SPRING,A crimson rose is in his hand._
127,LATE SPRING,
128,LATE SPRING,
129,LATE SPRING,1
130,LATE SPRING,
131,LATE SPRING,_Outside her garden. He waits musing._
132,LATE SPRING,
133,LATE SPRING,Herein the dearness of her is;
134,LATE SPRING,The thirty perfect days of June
135,LATE SPRING,"Made one, in maiden loveliness"
136,LATE SPRING,"Were not more sweet to clasp and kiss,"
137,LATE SPRING,With love not more in tune.
138,LATE SPRING,
139,LATE SPRING,"Ah me! I think she is too true,"
140,LATE SPRING,Too spiritual for life's rough way;
141,LATE SPRING,For in her eyes her soul looks new--
142,LATE SPRING,"Two bluet blossoms, watchet-blue,"
143,LATE SPRING,Are not so pure as they.
144,LATE SPRING,
145,LATE SPRING,"So good, so beautiful is she,"
146,LATE SPRING,"So soft and white, so fond and fair,"
147,LATE SPRING,Sometimes my heart fears she may be
148,LATE SPRING,"Not long for me, and secretly"
149,LATE SPRING,A sister of the air.
150,LATE SPRING,
151,LATE SPRING,
152,LATE SPRING,2
153,LATE SPRING,
154,LATE SPRING,_Dusk deepens. A whippoorwill calls._
155,LATE SPRING,
156,LATE SPRING,The whippoorwills are calling where
157,LATE SPRING,The golden west is graying;
158,LATE SPRING,"""'Tis time,"" they say, ""to meet him there--"
159,LATE SPRING,Why are you still delaying?
160,LATE SPRING,
161,LATE SPRING,"""He waits you where the old beech throws"
162,LATE SPRING,Its gnarly shadow over
163,LATE SPRING,"Wood-violet and the bramble rose,"
164,LATE SPRING,Frail maiden-fern and clover.
165,LATE SPRING,
166,LATE SPRING,"""Where elder and the sumach creep"
167,LATE SPRING,"Above your garden's paling,"
168,LATE SPRING,Whereon at noon the lizards sleep
169,LATE SPRING,Like lichens on the railing.
170,LATE SPRING,
171,LATE SPRING,"""Come! ere the early rising moon's"
172,LATE SPRING,Gold floods the violet valleys;
173,LATE SPRING,"Where mists, like phantom picaroons"
174,LATE SPRING,Anchor their stealthy galleys.
175,LATE SPRING,
176,LATE SPRING,"""Come! while the deepening amethyst"
177,LATE SPRING,Of dusk above is falling--
178,LATE SPRING,"'Tis time to tryst! 'tis time to tryst!"""
179,LATE SPRING,The whippoorwills are calling.
180,LATE SPRING,
181,LATE SPRING,They call you to these twilight ways
182,LATE SPRING,With dewy odor dripping--
183,LATE SPRING,"Ah, girlhood, through the rosy haze"
184,LATE SPRING,Come like a moonbeam slipping.
185,LATE SPRING,
186,LATE SPRING,
187,LATE SPRING,3
188,LATE SPRING,
189,LATE SPRING,"_He enters her garden, speaking dreamily:_"
190,LATE SPRING,
191,LATE SPRING,"There is a fading inward of the day,"
192,LATE SPRING,And all the pansy heaven clasps one star;
193,LATE SPRING,"The dwindling acres eastward glimmer gray,"
194,LATE SPRING,While all the world to westward smoulders far.
195,LATE SPRING,
196,LATE SPRING,Now to your glass will you pass for the last time?
197,LATE SPRING,"Pass! humming some ballad, I know,--"
198,LATE SPRING,Here where I wait it is late and is past time--
199,LATE SPRING,"Late! and the moments are slow, are slow."
200,LATE SPRING,
201,LATE SPRING,There is a drawing downward of the night;
202,LATE SPRING,The bridegroom Heaven bends down to kiss the moon;
203,LATE SPRING,"Above, the heights hang silver in her light;"
204,LATE SPRING,"Below, the woods stretch purple, deep in June."
205,LATE SPRING,
206,LATE SPRING,There in the dew is it you hiding lawny?
207,LATE SPRING,"You, or a moth in the vines?--"
208,LATE SPRING,"You!--by your hand, where the band twinkles tawny!"
209,LATE SPRING,"You!--by your ring, like a glowworm, that shines!"
210,LATE SPRING,
211,LATE SPRING,
212,LATE SPRING,4
213,LATE SPRING,
214,LATE SPRING,"_She approaches, laughing. She speaks,--_"
215,LATE SPRING,
216,LATE SPRING,You'd given up hope?
217,LATE SPRING,
218,HE,HE
219,HE,
220,HE,Believe me.
221,HE,
222,SHE,SHE
223,SHE,
224,SHE,"Why, is your love so poor?"
225,SHE,
226,HE,HE
227,HE,
228,HE,I knew you'd not deceive me.
229,HE,
230,SHE,SHE
231,SHE,
232,SHE,"As many a girl before,--"
233,SHE,"Ah, dear, you will forgive me?"
234,SHE,
235,HE,HE
236,HE,
237,HE,"Say no more, sweet, say no more!"
238,HE,
239,SHE,SHE
240,SHE,
241,SHE,"Love trusts, and that's enough, my dear."
242,SHE,"Trust wins to trust; whereof, my dear,"
243,SHE,"Love holds to love; and love, my dear,"
244,SHE,"Is--well, that's all my lore."
245,SHE,
246,HE,HE
247,HE,
248,HE,"Come, pay me or I'll scold you.--"
249,HE,Give me the kiss you owe.--
250,HE,You fly when I'd enfold you?
251,HE,
252,SHE,SHE
253,SHE,
254,SHE,"No! no! I say! now, no!"
255,SHE,"How often have I told you,"
256,SHE,You must not treat me so?
257,SHE,
258,HE,HE
259,HE,
260,HE,"More sweet the dusk for this is,"
261,HE,For lips that meet in kisses.--
262,HE,Come! come! why run from blisses
263,HE,As from a mortal foe?
264,HE,
265,HE,
266,HE,5
267,HE,
268,HE,_She stands smiling at him. She speaks:_
269,HE,
270,HE,How many words in the asking!
271,HE,How easily I can grieve you!--
272,HE,"My ""no"" in a ""yes"" was a-masking,"
273,HE,"Nor thought, dear, to deceive you.--"
274,HE,A kiss?--the humming-bird happiness here
275,HE,"In my heart consents.... But what are words,"
276,HE,When the thought of two souls in speech accords?
277,HE,"Affirmative, negative--what are they, dear?"
278,HE,"I wished to say ""yes,"" but somehow said ""no."""
279,HE,The woman within me thought you would know
280,HE,Thought that your heart would hear.
281,HE,
282,HE,_He speaks:_
283,HE,
284,HE,So many hopes in a wooing!--
285,HE,Therein you could not deceive me;
286,HE,Some things are sweeter for the pursuing--
287,HE,"I knew what you meant, believe me.--"
288,HE,"Bunched bells of the blush pomegranate, to fix"
289,HE,At your throat ... six drops of fire they are....
290,HE,Will you look where the moon and its following star
291,HE,Rise silvery over yon meadow ricks?
292,HE,"While I hold--while I lean your head back, so--"
293,HE,"For I know it is ""yes"" though you whisper ""no,"""
294,HE,"And my kisses, sweet, are six."
295,HE,
296,HE,
297,HE,6
298,HE,
299,HE,_Moths flutter around them. She speaks:_
300,HE,
301,HE,Look!--where the fiery
302,HE,Glow-worm in briery
303,HE,Banks of the moon-mellowed bowers
304,HE,Sparkles--how hazily
305,HE,Pinioned and arily
306,HE,"Delicate, warily,"
307,HE,"Drowsily, lazily,"
308,HE,Flutter the moths to the flowers.
309,HE,
310,HE,White as the dreamiest
311,HE,Bud of the creamiest
312,HE,"Rose in the garden that dozes,"
313,HE,See how they cling to them!
314,HE,Held in the heart of their
315,HE,Hearts like a part of their
316,HE,Perfume they swing to them
317,HE,Wings that are soft as the roses.
318,HE,
319,HE,Dim as the forming of
320,HE,Dew in the warming of
321,HE,"Moonlight, they light on the petals;"
322,HE,All is revealed to them;
323,HE,All--from the sunniest
324,HE,Tips to the honiest
325,HE,"Heart, whence they yield to them"
326,HE,Spice through the darkness that settles.
327,HE,
328,HE,So to our tremulous
329,HE,Souls come the emulous
330,HE,Spirits of love; through whose power
331,HE,"All that is best in us,"
332,HE,"All that is beautiful,"
333,HE,"All that is dutiful,"
334,HE,"Is made confessed in us,"
335,HE,Even as the scent of a flower.
336,HE,
337,HE,
338,HE,7
339,HE,
340,HE,"_Taking her hand, he says:_"
341,HE,
342,HE,What makes you beautiful?
343,HE,"Answer, now, answer!--"
344,HE,Is it that dutiful
345,HE,Souls are all beautiful?
346,HE,Is't that romance or
347,HE,"Beauty of spirit,"
348,HE,Which souls of merit
349,HE,Of heaven inherit?--
350,HE,Have you no answer?
351,HE,
352,HE,_She roguishly:_
353,HE,
354,HE,What makes you lovable?
355,HE,"Answer, dear, answer!--"
356,HE,Is it not provable
357,HE,That man is lovable
358,HE,Just because chance or
359,HE,Nature makes woman
360,HE,Love him?--Her human
361,HE,Part's to illumine.--
362,HE,Have you no answer?
363,HE,
364,HE,
365,HE,8
366,HE,
367,HE,"_Then, regarding him seriously, she continues:_"
368,HE,
369,HE,Could I recall every joy that befell me
370,HE,"There in the past with its anguish and bliss,"
371,HE,"Here in my heart it has whispered to tell me,"
372,HE,Those were no joys like this.
373,HE,
374,HE,Were it not well if our love could forget them
375,HE,Veiling the _was_ with the dawn of the _is_?
376,HE,"Dead with the past we should never regret them,"
377,HE,Being no joys like this.
378,HE,
379,HE,"When they were gone and the Present stood speechful,"
380,HE,"Ardent in word and in look and in kiss,"
381,HE,"What though we know that their eyes are beseechful,"
382,HE,Those were no joys like this.
383,HE,
384,HE,"Is it not well to have more of the spirit,"
385,HE,"Living for Futures where naught is amiss,"
386,HE,Less of the flesh with the Past pining near it?
387,HE,Is there a joy like this?
388,HE,
389,HE,
390,HE,9
391,HE,
392,HE,"_Leaving the garden for the lane. He, with lightness of heart._"
393,HE,
394,HE,"We will leave reason,"
395,HE,"Sweet, for a season;"
396,HE,Reason were treason
397,HE,Now that the nether
398,HE,"Spaces are clad, oh,"
399,HE,In silvery shadow--
400,HE,"We will be glad, oh,"
401,HE,Glad as this weather!
402,HE,
403,HE,"_She, responding to his mood:_"
404,HE,
405,HE,"Heart unto heart, where the moonlight is slanted,"
406,HE,Let us believe that our souls are enchanted:--
407,HE,I in the castle-keep; you are the airy
408,HE,Prince who comes seeking me; Love is the Fairy
409,HE,Bringing our hearts together.
410,HE,
411,HE,HE
412,HE,
413,HE,Starlight in masses
414,HE,Over us passes;
415,HE,And in the grass is
416,HE,Many a flower:
417,HE,Now will you tell me
418,HE,How'd you enspell me?
419,HE,What once befell me
420,HE,There in your bower?
421,HE,
422,SHE,SHE
423,SHE,
424,SHE,"Soul unto soul--in the moon's wizard glory,"
425,SHE,Let us believe we are parts in a story:--
426,SHE,I am a poem; a poet you hear it
427,SHE,"Whispered in star and in flower; a Spirit,"
428,SHE,"Love, puts my soul in your power."
429,SHE,
430,SHE,
431,SHE,10
432,SHE,
433,SHE,"_He, suddenly and very earnestly:_"
434,SHE,
435,SHE,Perhaps we lived in the days
436,SHE,Of the Khalif Haroun er Reshid;
437,SHE,"And loved, as the story says"
438,SHE,Did the Sultan's favorite one
439,SHE,"And the Persian Emperor's son,"
440,SHE,"Ali ben Bekkar, he"
441,SHE,Of the Kisra dynasty.
442,SHE,
443,SHE,"Do you know the story?--Well,"
444,SHE,You were Haroun's Sultana.
445,SHE,"When night on the palace fell,"
446,SHE,"A slave through a secret door,--"
447,SHE,"Low-arched on the Tigris' shore,--"
448,SHE,By a hidden winding stair
449,SHE,Brought me to your bower there.
450,SHE,
451,SHE,"Then there was laughter and mirth,"
452,SHE,"And feasting and singing together,"
453,SHE,In a chamber of wonderful worth;
454,SHE,In a chamber vaulted high
455,SHE,On columns of ivory;
456,SHE,"Its dome, like the irised skies,"
457,SHE,Mooned over with peacock eyes;
458,SHE,"Its curtains and furniture,"
459,SHE,Damask and juniper.
460,SHE,
461,SHE,Ten slave girls--like unto blooms--
462,SHE,"Stand, holding tamarisk torches,"
463,SHE,Silk-clad from the Irak looms;
464,SHE,"Ten handmaidens serve the feast,"
465,SHE,Each girl like a star in the east;
466,SHE,"Ten lutanists, lutes a-tune,"
467,SHE,"Wait, each like the Ramadan moon."
468,SHE,
469,SHE,For you in a stuff of Merv
470,SHE,"Blue-clad, unveiled and jewelled,"
471,SHE,No metaphor known may serve:
472,SHE,"Scarved deep with your raven hair,"
473,SHE,"The jewels like fireflies there,"
474,SHE,"Blossom and moon and star,"
475,SHE,The Lady Shemsennehar.
476,SHE,
477,SHE,The zone that girdles your waist
478,SHE,Would ransom a Prince and Emeer;
479,SHE,"In your coronet's gold enchased,"
480,SHE,"And your bracelet's twisted bar,"
481,SHE,Burn rubies of Istakhar;
482,SHE,And pearls of the Jamshid race
483,SHE,Hang looped on your bosom's lace.
484,SHE,
485,SHE,You stand like the letter I;
486,SHE,"Dawn-faced, with eyes that sparkle"
487,SHE,Black stars in a rosy sky;
488,SHE,"Mouth like a cloven peach,"
489,SHE,Sweet with your smiling speech;
490,SHE,Cheeks that the blood presumes
491,SHE,To make pomegranate blooms.
492,SHE,
493,SHE,"With roses of Rocknabad,"
494,SHE,"Hyacinths of Bokhara,--"
495,SHE,Creamily cool and clad
496,SHE,"In gauze,--girls scatter the floor"
497,SHE,From pillar to cedarn door.
498,SHE,"Then a poppy-bloom at each ear,"
499,SHE,Come the dancing girls of Kashmeer.
500,SHE,
501,SHE,"Kohl in their eyes, down the room,--"
502,SHE,That opaline casting-bottles
503,SHE,"Have showered with rose perfume,--"
504,SHE,They glitter and drift and swoon
505,SHE,To the dulcimer's languishing tune;
506,SHE,"In the liquid light like stars,"
507,SHE,And moons and nenuphars.
508,SHE,
509,SHE,"Carbuncles, tragacanth-red,"
510,SHE,Smoulder in armlet and anklet;
511,SHE,Gleaming on breast and on head
512,SHE,"Bangles of coins, that are angled,"
513,SHE,"Tinkle; and veils, that are spangled,"
514,SHE,Flutter from coiffure and wrist
515,SHE,Like a star-bewildered mist.
516,SHE,
517,SHE,Each dancing-girl is a flower
518,SHE,Of the Tuba from vales of El Liwa.--
519,SHE,How the bronzen censers glower!
520,SHE,And scents of ambergris pour
521,SHE,"And myrrh brought of Lahore,"
522,SHE,And musk of Khoten! how good
523,SHE,Is the scent of the sandal-wood!
524,SHE,
525,SHE,A lutanist smites her lute;
526,SHE,Sings loves of Mejnoon and Leila--
527,SHE,Her voice is a houri flute;--
528,SHE,While the fragrant flambeaux wave
529,SHE,"Barbaric o'er free and slave,"
530,SHE,O'er fabrics and bezels of gems
531,SHE,And roses in anadems.
532,SHE,
533,SHE,"Sherbets in ewers of gold,"
534,SHE,Fruits in salvers carnelian;
535,SHE,"Flagons of grotesque mold,"
536,SHE,"Made of a sapphire glass,"
537,SHE,Brimmed with wine of Shiraz;
538,SHE,Shaddock and melon and grape
539,SHE,On plate of an antique shape.
540,SHE,
541,SHE,"Vases of frosted rose,"
542,SHE,"Of limpid alabaster,"
543,SHE,Filled with the mountain snows;
544,SHE,"Goblets of mother-of-pearl,"
545,SHE,One filigree silver-swirl;
546,SHE,Vessels of gold foamed up
547,SHE,With spray of spar on the cup.
548,SHE,
549,SHE,Then a slave bursts in with a cry:
550,SHE,"""The eunuchs! the Khalif's eunuchs!--"
551,SHE,With scimitars bared draw nigh!
552,SHE,"Wesif and Afif and he,"
553,SHE,"Chief of the hideous three,"
554,SHE,Mesrour!--the Sultan's seen
555,SHE,"'Mid a hundred weapons' sheen!"""
556,SHE,
557,SHE,Did we part when we heard this? No!
558,SHE,It seems that my soul remembers
559,SHE,"How I clasped you and kissed you, so."
560,SHE,When they came they found us--dead
561,SHE,On the flowers our blood dyed red;
562,SHE,"Our lips together, and"
563,SHE,The dagger in my hand.
564,SHE,
565,SHE,
566,SHE,11
567,SHE,
568,SHE,"_She, musingly:_"
569,SHE,
570,SHE,"How it was I cannot tell,"
571,SHE,For I know not where nor why;
572,SHE,But perhaps we loved too well
573,SHE,In some world that does not lie
574,SHE,"East or west of where we dwell,"
575,SHE,And beneath no mortal sky.
576,SHE,
577,SHE,Was it in the golden ages
578,SHE,"Or the iron?--I had heard,--"
579,SHE,"In the prophecy of sages,--"
580,SHE,"Haply, how had come a bird,"
581,SHE,Underneath whose wing were pages
582,SHE,Of an unknown lover's word.
583,SHE,
584,SHE,I forget. You may remember
585,SHE,How the earthquake shook our ships;
586,SHE,"How our city, one huge ember,"
587,SHE,Blazed within the thick eclipse.
588,SHE,When you found me--deep December
589,SHE,Sealed my icy eyes and lips.
590,SHE,
591,SHE,I forget. No one may say
592,SHE,That such things can not be true:--
593,SHE,"Here a flower dies to-day,"
594,SHE,And to-morrow blooms anew....
595,SHE,"Death is silent.--Tell me, pray,"
596,SHE,Why men doubt what God can do?
597,SHE,
598,SHE,
599,SHE,12
600,SHE,
601,SHE,"_He, with conviction._"
602,SHE,
603,SHE,"As to that, nothing to tell,"
604,SHE,You being all my belief;
605,SHE,Doubt may not enter or dwell
606,SHE,Here where your image is chief;
607,SHE,"Here where your name is a spell,"
608,SHE,Potent in joy and in grief.
609,SHE,
610,SHE,Is it the glamor of spring
611,SHE,Working in us so we seem
612,SHE,Aye to have loved? that we cling
613,SHE,"Even to some fancy or dream,"
614,SHE,Rainbowing everything
615,SHE,Here in our souls with its gleam?
616,SHE,
617,SHE,See! how the synod is met
618,SHE,There of the heavens to preach us--
619,SHE,"Freed from the earth's oubliette,"
620,SHE,See how the blossoms beseech us--
621,SHE,Were it not well to forget
622,SHE,Winter and night as they teach us?
623,SHE,
624,SHE,"Dew and a bud and a star,"
625,SHE,"These,--like a beautiful thought,"
626,SHE,Over man's wisdom how far!--
627,SHE,God for some purpose has wrought;
628,SHE,"And though they're that which they are,"
629,SHE,What are the thoughts they have brought?
630,SHE,
631,SHE,Stars and the moon; and they roll
632,SHE,Over our way that is white.
633,SHE,Here shall we end the long stroll?
634,SHE,Here shall I kiss you good-night?
635,SHE,"Or, for a while, soul to soul,"
636,SHE,Linger and dream of delight?
637,SHE,
638,SHE,
639,SHE,13
640,SHE,
641,SHE,"_They enter the garden again.... She, somewhat pensively._"
642,SHE,
643,SHE,Myths tell of walls and cities that arose
644,SHE,"To melody. But I would build with tone,"
645,SHE,"Had I that harp, a world for us alone,"
646,SHE,"A world of love, and joy, and deep repose."
647,SHE,
648,SHE,"A land of lavender light, of blue-bell skies;"
649,SHE,Pale peaks that rise against the gold of eve;
650,SHE,"And on one height, the splendors never leave,"
651,SHE,Our castled home o'er which the wild swan flies.
652,SHE,
653,SHE,"There, pitiless, the ruined hand of death"
654,SHE,"Should never reach. No bud, no thing should fade;"
655,SHE,"All should be perfect, pure, and unafraid;"
656,SHE,And life serener than an angel's breath.
657,SHE,
658,SHE,The days should move to music; wildly tame
659,SHE,The nights should move to music and the stars;
660,SHE,"And morn and evening in their opal cars,"
661,SHE,"Like heralds, banner God's eternal name."
662,SHE,
663,SHE,O world! O life! desired and to be!
664,SHE,How shall we reach thee?--dark the way and dim.
665,SHE,"--Give me your hand, love, let us follow him,"
666,SHE,Love with the mystery and the melody.
667,SHE,
668,SHE,
669,SHE,14
670,SHE,
671,SHE,"_He, observing the various flowers around them:_"
672,SHE,
673,SHE,Violets and anemones
674,SHE,The surrendered hours
675,SHE,"Pour, as handsels, round the knees"
676,SHE,"Of the Spring, who to the breeze"
677,SHE,Flings her myriad flowers.
678,SHE,
679,SHE,Like to coins the sumptuous day
680,SHE,Strews with blossoms golden
681,SHE,"Every furlong of his way,--"
682,SHE,Like a Sultan gone to pray
683,SHE,At a Kaaba olden.
684,SHE,
685,SHE,"And the night, with spark on spark,"
686,SHE,"Clad in dim attire,"
687,SHE,"Dots with Stars the haloed dark,--"
688,SHE,As a priest around the Ark
689,SHE,Lights his lamps of fire.
690,SHE,
691,SHE,These are but the cosmic strings
692,SHE,"To the harp of Beauty,"
693,SHE,To that instrument which sings
694,SHE,In our souls of love that brings
695,SHE,Peace and faith and duty.
696,SHE,
697,SHE,
698,SHE,15
699,SHE,
700,SHE,"_She, seriously:_"
701,SHE,
702,SHE,Duty?--Comfort of the sinner
703,SHE,And the saint!--when grief and trial
704,SHE,"Weigh us, and within our inner"
705,SHE,"Selves,--responsive to love's viol,--"
706,SHE,"Hope's soft voice grows thin and thinner,"
707,SHE,It is kin to self-denial.
708,SHE,
709,SHE,Self-denial!--through whose feeling
710,SHE,We are gainer though we're loser;
711,SHE,All the finer force revealing
712,SHE,Of our natures. No accuser
713,SHE,"Is the conscience then, but healing"
714,SHE,Of the wound of which we're chooser.
715,SHE,
716,SHE,Some one said no flower knoweth
717,SHE,Of the fragrance it revealeth;
718,SHE,"Song, its soul that overfloweth,"
719,SHE,Never nightingale's heart feeleth--
720,SHE,"Such the love the spirit groweth,"
721,SHE,Love unconscious if it healeth.
722,SHE,
723,SHE,
724,SHE,16
725,SHE,
726,SHE,"_He, after a pause, lightly:_"
727,SHE,
728,SHE,An elf there is who stables the hot
729,SHE,Red wasp that stings on the apricot;
730,SHE,An elf who rowels his spiteful bay
731,SHE,"Like a mote on a ray, away, away;"
732,SHE,An elf who saddles the hornet lean
733,SHE,To din i' the ear o' the swinging bean;
734,SHE,"Who straddles, with cap cocked all awry,"
735,SHE,The bottle-blue back o' the dragon-fly.
736,SHE,
737,SHE,And this is the elf who sips and sips
738,SHE,From clover-horns whence the perfume drips;
739,SHE,"And, drunk with dew, in the glimmering gloam"
740,SHE,Awaits the wild-bee's coming home;
741,SHE,"In ambush lies, where none may see,"
742,SHE,And robs the caravan bumble-bee--
743,SHE,Gold bags of honey the bees must pay
744,SHE,To the bandit elf of the fairy way.
745,SHE,
746,SHE,"Another ouphen the butterflies know,"
747,SHE,Who paints their wings with the hues that glow
748,SHE,On blossoms.--Squeezing from tubes of dew
749,SHE,Pansy colors of every hue
750,SHE,"On his bloom's pied pallet, he paints the wings"
751,SHE,"Of the butterflies, moths, and other things."
752,SHE,"This is the elf that the hollyhocks hear,"
753,SHE,Who dangles a brilliant in each one's ear;
754,SHE,"Teases at noon the pane's green fly,"
755,SHE,And lights at night the glow-worm's eye.
756,SHE,
757,SHE,"But the dearest elf, so the poets say,"
758,SHE,Is the elf who hides in an eye of gray;
759,SHE,Who curls in a dimple and slips along
760,SHE,The strings of a lute to a lover's song;
761,SHE,"Who smiles in her smile, and frowns in her frown,"
762,SHE,And dreams in the scent of her glove or gown;
763,SHE,Hides and beckons as all may note
764,SHE,In the bloom or the bow of a maiden's throat.
765,SHE,

768,SHE,
769,SHE,"_She, standing among the flowers:_"
770,SHE,
771,SHE,"Soft through the trees the night wind sighs,"
772,SHE,And swoons and dies.
773,SHE,"Above, the stars hang wanly white;"
774,SHE,"Here, through the dark,"
775,SHE,"A drizzled gold, the fireflies"
776,SHE,Rain mimic stars in spark on spark.--
777,SHE,"'Tis time to part, to say good-night."
778,SHE,Good-night.
779,SHE,
780,SHE,From fern to flower the night-moths cross
781,SHE,At drowsy loss.
782,SHE,The moon drifts veiled through clouds of white;
783,SHE,"And pearly pale,"
784,SHE,"A silver blur, through beds of moss,"
785,SHE,Their tiny moons the glow-worms trail.--
786,SHE,"'Tis time to part, to say good-night."
787,SHE,Good-night.

794,SHE,"You say you cannot wed me, now"
795,SHE,That roses and the June are here?
796,SHE,To your decision I must bow.--
797,SHE,"Ah, well! 'tis just as well, my dear:"
798,SHE,"We'll swear again each old love vow,"
799,SHE,And wait another year.
800,SHE,
801,SHE,Another year of love with you!
802,SHE,"Of dreams and doubts, of sun and rain!"
803,SHE,"When field and forest bloom anew,"
804,SHE,"And locust clusters pelt the lane,"
805,SHE,"When all the song-birds wed and woo,"
806,SHE,"I'll not take ""no"" again."
807,SHE,
808,SHE,Oft shall I lie awake and mark
809,SHE,"The hours by no clanging clock,"
810,SHE,But in the dim and distant dark
811,SHE,The crowing of some punctual cock;
812,SHE,Then up as early as the lark
813,SHE,To meet you by our rock.
814,SHE,
815,SHE,The rock where first we met at tryst;
816,SHE,Where first I wooed and won your love--
817,SHE,Remember how the moon and mist
818,SHE,Made mystery of the heaven above
819,SHE,As now to-night?--How first I kissed
820,SHE,"Your lips, you trembling like a dove?"
821,SHE,
822,SHE,"So, then, you cannot wed me now"
823,SHE,"That roses and the June are here,"
824,SHE,That warmth and fragrance weigh each bough?
825,SHE,And yet your reason is not clear.
826,SHE,"Ah, well! We'll swear anew each vow,"
827,SHE,And wait another year.

837,EARLY SUMMER,Sings by the vine-entangled gate;
838,EARLY SUMMER,The slim moon slants a timid edge
839,EARLY SUMMER,Of pearl through one low cloud of slate;
840,EARLY SUMMER,Around dark door and window-ledge
841,EARLY SUMMER,Like dreams the shadows wait.
842,EARLY SUMMER,"And through the summer dusk she goes,"
843,EARLY SUMMER,On her white breast a crimson rose._

846,EARLY SUMMER,1
847,EARLY SUMMER,
848,EARLY SUMMER,"_She delays, meditating. A rainy afternoon._"
849,EARLY SUMMER,
850,EARLY SUMMER,Gray skies and the foggy rain
851,EARLY SUMMER,Dripping from sullen eaves;
852,EARLY SUMMER,Over and over again
853,EARLY SUMMER,Dull drop of the trickling leaves;
854,EARLY SUMMER,"And the woodward-winding lane,"
855,EARLY SUMMER,And the hill with its shocks of sheaves
856,EARLY SUMMER,One scarce perceives.
857,EARLY SUMMER,
858,EARLY SUMMER,Shall I go in such wet weather
859,EARLY SUMMER,By the lane or over the hill?--
860,EARLY SUMMER,Where the blossoming milkweed's feather
861,EARLY SUMMER,The drops like diamonds fill;
862,EARLY SUMMER,"Where, draggled and drenched together,"
863,EARLY SUMMER,"The ox-eyes rank the rill,"
864,EARLY SUMMER,To the old corn-mill.
865,EARLY SUMMER,
866,EARLY SUMMER,"The creek by now is swollen,"
867,EARLY SUMMER,And its foaming cascades sound;
868,EARLY SUMMER,"And the lilies, smeared with pollen,"
869,EARLY SUMMER,In the dam look dull and drowned.
870,EARLY SUMMER,'Tis a path I oft have stolen
871,EARLY SUMMER,To the bridge that rambles round
872,EARLY SUMMER,With willows bound.
873,EARLY SUMMER,
874,EARLY SUMMER,"Through a valley wild with berry,"
875,EARLY SUMMER,"Packed thick with the iron-weeds,"
876,EARLY SUMMER,"And elder,--washed and very"
877,EARLY SUMMER,"Fragrant,--the fenced path leads;"
878,EARLY SUMMER,Past oak and wilding cherry
879,EARLY SUMMER,"To a place of flags and reeds,"
880,EARLY SUMMER,That the water bredes.
881,EARLY SUMMER,
882,EARLY SUMMER,The sun through the sad sky bleaches--
883,EARLY SUMMER,Is that a thrush that calls?
884,EARLY SUMMER,That bird who so beseeches?
885,EARLY SUMMER,"And see! on the balsam's balls,"
886,EARLY SUMMER,And leaves of the water-beeches--
887,EARLY SUMMER,One blister of wart-like galls--
888,EARLY SUMMER,No raindrop falls.
889,EARLY SUMMER,
890,EARLY SUMMER,My shawl instead of a bonnet!...
891,EARLY SUMMER,"Though the woods be soaking yet,"
892,EARLY SUMMER,"Through the wet to the rock I'll run it,--"
893,EARLY SUMMER,How sweet to meet i' the wet!
894,EARLY SUMMER,"Our rock with the vine upon it,--"

903,EARLY SUMMER,How fresh the purple clover
904,EARLY SUMMER,Smells in its veil of rain!
905,EARLY SUMMER,And where the leaves brim over
906,EARLY SUMMER,How fragrant is the lane!
907,EARLY SUMMER,"See, how the sodden acres,"
908,EARLY SUMMER,"Forlorn of all their rakers,"
909,EARLY SUMMER,"Their hay and harvest makers,"
910,EARLY SUMMER,Look green as spring again.
911,EARLY SUMMER,
912,EARLY SUMMER,Drops from the trumpet flowers
913,EARLY SUMMER,Rain on us as we pass;
914,EARLY SUMMER,"And every zephyr showers,"
915,EARLY SUMMER,"From tilted leaf or grass,"
916,EARLY SUMMER,"Clear beads of moisture, seeming"
917,EARLY SUMMER,"Pale, pointed emeralds gleaming;"
918,EARLY SUMMER,"Where, through the green boughs streaming,"
919,EARLY SUMMER,The daylight strikes like glass.
920,EARLY SUMMER,
921,EARLY SUMMER,_She speaks._
922,EARLY SUMMER,
923,EARLY SUMMER,"How dewy, clean and fragrant"
924,EARLY SUMMER,Look now the green and gold!--
925,EARLY SUMMER,And breezes trailing vagrant
926,EARLY SUMMER,Spill all the spice they hold.
927,EARLY SUMMER,The west begins to glimmer;
928,EARLY SUMMER,"And shadows, stretching slimmer,"
929,EARLY SUMMER,Crouch on the ways; and dimmer
930,EARLY SUMMER,Grow field and forest old.
931,EARLY SUMMER,
932,EARLY SUMMER,Beyond those rainy reaches
933,EARLY SUMMER,"Of woodland, far and lone,"
934,EARLY SUMMER,A whippoorwill beseeches;
935,EARLY SUMMER,And now an owl's vague moan
936,EARLY SUMMER,Strikes faint upon the hearing.--
937,EARLY SUMMER,These say the dusk is nearing.
938,EARLY SUMMER,"And, see, the heavens clearing"
939,EARLY SUMMER,Take on a tender tone.
940,EARLY SUMMER,
941,EARLY SUMMER,How feebly chirps the cricket!
942,EARLY SUMMER,How thin the tree-toads cry!
943,EARLY SUMMER,Blurred in the wild-rose thicket
944,EARLY SUMMER,Gleams wet the firefly.--
945,EARLY SUMMER,This way toward home is nearest;
946,EARLY SUMMER,Of weeds and briars clearest....

962,EARLY SUMMER,And beneath these beeches follow
963,EARLY SUMMER,This wild strip of way
964,EARLY SUMMER,
965,EARLY SUMMER,Towards the stream; wherein are seen
966,EARLY SUMMER,Stealing gar and darting minnow;
967,EARLY SUMMER,Over which snake-feeders winnow
968,EARLY SUMMER,Wings of black and green.
969,EARLY SUMMER,
970,EARLY SUMMER,Like a cactus flames the sun;
971,EARLY SUMMER,"And the mighty weaver, Even,"
972,EARLY SUMMER,"Tenuous colored, there in heaven,"
973,EARLY SUMMER,His rich weft's begun....
974,EARLY SUMMER,
975,EARLY SUMMER,How I love you! from the time--
976,EARLY SUMMER,"You remember, do you not?--"
977,EARLY SUMMER,"When, within your orchard-plot,"
978,EARLY SUMMER,"I was reading rhyme,"
979,EARLY SUMMER,
980,EARLY SUMMER,As I told you. And 'twas thus--
981,EARLY SUMMER,"""By the blue Trinacrian sea,"
982,EARLY SUMMER,Far in pastoral Sicily
983,EARLY SUMMER,"With Theocritus""--"
984,EARLY SUMMER,
985,EARLY SUMMER,That I answered you who asked.
986,EARLY SUMMER,But the curious part was this:--
987,EARLY SUMMER,That the whole thing was amiss;
988,EARLY SUMMER,That the Greek but masked
989,EARLY SUMMER,
990,EARLY SUMMER,Tales of old Boccaccio--
991,EARLY SUMMER,Tall Decameronian maids
992,EARLY SUMMER,"Strolled among Italian glades,"
993,EARLY SUMMER,"Smiling, sweet and slow."
994,EARLY SUMMER,
995,EARLY SUMMER,"And when you approached,--my book"
996,EARLY SUMMER,"Dropped in wonder,--seemingly"
997,EARLY SUMMER,"To myself I said, ""'Tis she!"""
998,EARLY SUMMER,And arose to look
999,EARLY SUMMER,
1000,EARLY SUMMER,In Lauretta's eyes and--true!
1001,EARLY SUMMER,"Found them yours.--You shook your head,"
1002,EARLY SUMMER,"Laughing at me, as you said,"
1003,EARLY SUMMER,"""Did I frighten you?"""
1004,EARLY SUMMER,
1005,EARLY SUMMER,You had come for cherries; these
1006,EARLY SUMMER,Dreamily I climbed for while
1007,EARLY SUMMER,"You still questioned with a smile,"
1008,EARLY SUMMER,And still tried to tease.
1009,EARLY SUMMER,
1010,EARLY SUMMER,"Ah, love, just two years have gone"
1011,EARLY SUMMER,"Since then. I remember, you"
1012,EARLY SUMMER,Wore a dress of billowy blue
1013,EARLY SUMMER,"Muslin, or of lawn."
1014,EARLY SUMMER,
1015,EARLY SUMMER,"And that apron still I see,--"
1016,EARLY SUMMER,"White, with cherry-juice red-stained,--"
1017,EARLY SUMMER,Which you held; wherein I rained
1018,EARLY SUMMER,Ripeness from the tree.
1019,EARLY SUMMER,
1020,EARLY SUMMER,"And I asked you--for, you know,"
1021,EARLY SUMMER,To my eyes your serious eyes
1022,EARLY SUMMER,"Spoke such sweet philosophies,--"
1023,EARLY SUMMER,If you'd read Rousseau.
1024,EARLY SUMMER,
1025,EARLY SUMMER,"You remember how a chance,"
1026,EARLY SUMMER,"Somewhat like to mine, one June"
1027,EARLY SUMMER,"Happened him at castle Toune,"
1028,EARLY SUMMER,Over there in France?
1029,EARLY SUMMER,
1030,EARLY SUMMER,And a cherry dropping fair
1031,EARLY SUMMER,"On your cheek I, envying it,"
1032,EARLY SUMMER,Said--remembering Rousseau's wit--
1033,EARLY SUMMER,"""Would my lips were there!"""
1034,EARLY SUMMER,
1035,EARLY SUMMER,"How you laughed and blushed, I know.--"
1036,EARLY SUMMER,Here's the stream. The west has narrowed
1037,EARLY SUMMER,"To a streak of gold, deep arrowed.--"
1038,EARLY SUMMER,There's a skiff. Let's row.
1039,EARLY SUMMER,
1040,EARLY SUMMER,
1041,EARLY SUMMER,4
1042,EARLY SUMMER,
1043,EARLY SUMMER,"_Entering the skiff, she speaks:_"
1044,EARLY SUMMER,
1045,EARLY SUMMER,"Waters, flowing dark and bright"
1046,EARLY SUMMER,"In the sunlight or the moon,"
1047,EARLY SUMMER,Seize my soul with such delight
1048,EARLY SUMMER,As a visible music might;
1049,EARLY SUMMER,"As some slow, majestic tune"
1050,EARLY SUMMER,Made material to the sight.
1051,EARLY SUMMER,
1052,EARLY SUMMER,"Blossoms colored like the skies,"
1053,EARLY SUMMER,"Sunset-hued and tame or wild,"
1054,EARLY SUMMER,Fill my soul with such surmise
1055,EARLY SUMMER,As the mind might realize
1056,EARLY SUMMER,"If our thoughts, all undefiled,"
1057,EARLY SUMMER,Should take form before our eyes.
1058,EARLY SUMMER,
1059,EARLY SUMMER,So to me do these appeal;
1060,EARLY SUMMER,So they sway me every hour:
1061,EARLY SUMMER,Letting all their beauty steal
1062,EARLY SUMMER,"On my soul to make it feel,"
1063,EARLY SUMMER,"Through a rivulet or flower,"
1064,EARLY SUMMER,More than any words reveal.
1065,EARLY SUMMER,

1070,EARLY SUMMER,
1071,EARLY SUMMER,"See, sweetheart, how the lilies lay"
1072,EARLY SUMMER,Their lambent leaves about our way;
1073,EARLY SUMMER,"Or, pollen-dusty, nod and float"
1074,EARLY SUMMER,Their moon-like flowers around our boat.--
1075,EARLY SUMMER,The middle of the stream we've reached
1076,EARLY SUMMER,Three strokes from where our boat was beached.
1077,EARLY SUMMER,
1078,EARLY SUMMER,"Look up. You scarce can see the sky,"
1079,EARLY SUMMER,"Through trees that lean, dark, deep, and high;"
1080,EARLY SUMMER,And coiled with grape and trailing vine
1081,EARLY SUMMER,Build a vast roof of shade and shine;
1082,EARLY SUMMER,"A house of leaves, where shadows walk,"
1083,EARLY SUMMER,And whispering winds and waters talk.
1084,EARLY SUMMER,
1085,EARLY SUMMER,There is no path. The saplings choke
1086,EARLY SUMMER,The trunks they spring from. There an oak
1087,EARLY SUMMER,"Lies rotting; and that sycamore,"
1088,EARLY SUMMER,"Which lays its bulk from shore to shore,--"
1089,EARLY SUMMER,"Uprooted by the floods,--perchance,"
1090,EARLY SUMMER,May be the bridge to some romance.
1091,EARLY SUMMER,
1092,EARLY SUMMER,Now opening through a willow fringe
1093,EARLY SUMMER,"The waters creep, one tawny tinge"
1094,EARLY SUMMER,Of sunset; and on either marge
1095,EARLY SUMMER,The cottonwoods make walls of shade;
1096,EARLY SUMMER,"And, near, the gradual hills loom large"
1097,EARLY SUMMER,"Within its mirror. Herons wade,"
1098,EARLY SUMMER,"Or fly, like Faery birds, from grass"
1099,EARLY SUMMER,That mats the shore by which we pass.
1100,EARLY SUMMER,
1101,EARLY SUMMER,_She speaks._
1102,EARLY SUMMER,
1103,EARLY SUMMER,"On we pass; we rippling pass,"
1104,EARLY SUMMER,On sunset waters still as glass.
1105,EARLY SUMMER,A vesper-sparrow flies above
1106,EARLY SUMMER,Soft twittering to its woodland love.
1107,EARLY SUMMER,A whippoorwill now calls afar;
1108,EARLY SUMMER,"And 'gainst the west, like some swift star,"
1109,EARLY SUMMER,A glittering jay flies screaming. Slim
1110,EARLY SUMMER,The sand-snipes and king-fishers skim
1111,EARLY SUMMER,Before us; and some evening thrush--
1112,EARLY SUMMER,Who may discover where such sing?--
1113,EARLY SUMMER,The silence rinses with a gush
1114,EARLY SUMMER,Of mellow music bubbling.
1115,EARLY SUMMER,
1116,EARLY SUMMER,_He speaks._
1117,EARLY SUMMER,
1118,EARLY SUMMER,On we pass.--Now let us oar
1119,EARLY SUMMER,"To yonder strip of ragged shore,"
1120,EARLY SUMMER,"Where, from a rock with lichens hoar,"
1121,EARLY SUMMER,A ferny spring wells. Gliding by
1122,EARLY SUMMER,The sulphur-colored firefly
1123,EARLY SUMMER,"Lights its pale lamp where mallows gloom,"
1124,EARLY SUMMER,And wild-bean and wild-mustard bloom.--
1125,EARLY SUMMER,Some hunter there within the woods
1126,EARLY SUMMER,Last fall encamped those ashes say
1127,EARLY SUMMER,And campfire boughs.--The solitudes
1128,EARLY SUMMER,Grow dreamy with the death of day.
1129,EARLY SUMMER,
1130,EARLY SUMMER,
1131,EARLY SUMMER,6
1132,EARLY SUMMER,
1133,EARLY SUMMER,_She sings._
1134,EARLY SUMMER,
1135,EARLY SUMMER,Over the fields of millet
1136,EARLY SUMMER,A young bird tries its wings;
1137,EARLY SUMMER,"And sweet as a woodland rillet,"
1138,EARLY SUMMER,Its first wild music rings--
1139,EARLY SUMMER,"Soul of my soul, where the meadows roll"
1140,EARLY SUMMER,What is the song it sings?
1141,EARLY SUMMER,
1142,EARLY SUMMER,"""Love, and a glad good-morrow,"
1143,EARLY SUMMER,Heart where the rapture is!
1144,EARLY SUMMER,"Good-morrow, good-morrow!"
1145,EARLY SUMMER,Adieu to sorrow!
1146,EARLY SUMMER,Here is the road to bliss:
1147,EARLY SUMMER,"Where all day long you may hearken my song,"
1148,EARLY SUMMER,"And kiss, kiss, kiss!"""
1149,EARLY SUMMER,
1150,EARLY SUMMER,"Over the fields of clover,"
1151,EARLY SUMMER,"Where the wild bee drones and sways,"
1152,EARLY SUMMER,"The wind, like a shepherd lover,"
1153,EARLY SUMMER,Flutes on the fragrant ways--
1154,EARLY SUMMER,"Heart of my heart, where the blossoms part,"
1155,EARLY SUMMER,What is the air he plays?
1156,EARLY SUMMER,
1157,EARLY SUMMER,"""Love, and a song to follow,"
1158,EARLY SUMMER,Soul with the face a-gleam!
1159,EARLY SUMMER,"Come follow, come follow,"
1160,EARLY SUMMER,"O'er hill and o'er hollow,"
1161,EARLY SUMMER,To the land o' the bloom and beam;
1162,EARLY SUMMER,"Where under the flowers you may listen for hours,"
1163,EARLY SUMMER,"And dream, dream, dream!"""
1164,EARLY SUMMER,
1165,EARLY SUMMER,
1166,EARLY SUMMER,7
1167,EARLY SUMMER,
1168,EARLY SUMMER,"_He speaks, letting the boat drift._"
1169,EARLY SUMMER,
1170,EARLY SUMMER,Here the shores are irised. Grasses
1171,EARLY SUMMER,Clump the water dark that glasses
1172,EARLY SUMMER,Broken wood and deepened distance.
1173,EARLY SUMMER,Far the musical persistence
1174,EARLY SUMMER,Of a field-lark lingers low
1175,EARLY SUMMER,In the west where tulips blow.
1176,EARLY SUMMER,
1177,EARLY SUMMER,White before us flames one pointed
1178,EARLY SUMMER,Star; and Day hath Night anointed
1179,EARLY SUMMER,King; from out her azure ewer
1180,EARLY SUMMER,"Pouring starry fire, truer"
1181,EARLY SUMMER,Than pure gold. Star-crowned he stands
1182,EARLY SUMMER,With the star-light in his hands.
1183,EARLY SUMMER,
1184,EARLY SUMMER,Will the moon bleach through the ragged
1185,EARLY SUMMER,Tree-tops ere we reach yon jagged
1186,EARLY SUMMER,"Rock, that rises gradually,"
1187,EARLY SUMMER,Pharos of our homeward valley?--
1188,EARLY SUMMER,All the west is smouldering red;
1189,EARLY SUMMER,Embers are the stars o'erhead.
1190,EARLY SUMMER,
1191,EARLY SUMMER,At my soul some Protean elf is;
1192,EARLY SUMMER,You're Simaetha; I am Delphis.
1193,EARLY SUMMER,"You are Sappho and your Phaon,"
1194,EARLY SUMMER,I.--We love.--There lies a ray on
1195,EARLY SUMMER,All the Dark Æolian seas
1196,EARLY SUMMER,'Round the violet Lesbian leas.
1197,EARLY SUMMER,
1198,EARLY SUMMER,On we drift. I love you. Nearer
1199,EARLY SUMMER,"Looms our island. Rosier, clearer,"
1200,EARLY SUMMER,"The Leucadian cliff we follow,"
1201,EARLY SUMMER,Where the temple of Apollo
1202,EARLY SUMMER,Shines--a pale and pillared fire....
1203,EARLY SUMMER,"Strike, oh, strike the Lydian lyre!--"
1204,EARLY SUMMER,"While in Hellas still we seem,"
1205,EARLY SUMMER,Let us sing of that we dream.
1206,EARLY SUMMER,
1207,EARLY SUMMER,
1208,EARLY SUMMER,8
1209,EARLY SUMMER,
1210,EARLY SUMMER,"_Landing, he sings._"
1211,EARLY SUMMER,
1212,EARLY SUMMER,"Night, night, 'tis night. The moon drifts low above us,"
1213,EARLY SUMMER,And all its gold is tangled in the stream:
1214,EARLY SUMMER,"Love, love, my love, and all the stars, that love us,"
1215,EARLY SUMMER,The stars smile down and every star's a dream.
1216,EARLY SUMMER,
1217,EARLY SUMMER,"In odorous purple, where the falling warble"
1218,EARLY SUMMER,"Of water cascades and the plunged foam glows,"
1219,EARLY SUMMER,A columned ruin lifts its sculptured marble
1220,EARLY SUMMER,Friezed with the chiselled rebeck and the rose.
1221,EARLY SUMMER,
1222,EARLY SUMMER,_She sings._
1223,EARLY SUMMER,
1224,EARLY SUMMER,"Sleep, Sleep, sweet Sleep sleeps at the drifting tiller,"
1225,EARLY SUMMER,And in our sail the Spirit of the Rain--
1226,EARLY SUMMER,"Love, love, my love, ah, bid thy heart be stiller,"
1227,EARLY SUMMER,"And, hark! the music of the resonant main."
1228,EARLY SUMMER,
1229,EARLY SUMMER,What flowers are those that blow their balm unto us
1230,EARLY SUMMER,"From mouths of wild aroma, each a flame?--"
1231,EARLY SUMMER,"That breathe of love, of love we know that drew us,"
1232,EARLY SUMMER,"That kissed our eyes, so we might see the same."
1233,EARLY SUMMER,
1234,EARLY SUMMER,_He speaks._
1235,EARLY SUMMER,
1236,EARLY SUMMER,"Night, night, 'tis night!--no dream is this to banish;"
1237,EARLY SUMMER,The temple and the nightingale _are_ there!
1238,EARLY SUMMER,"Our love has made them, nevermore to vanish,"
1239,EARLY SUMMER,"Real as yon moon, this wild-rose in your hair."
1240,EARLY SUMMER,
1241,EARLY SUMMER,"Night, night, 'tis night!--and love's own star's before us,"
1242,EARLY SUMMER,Its bright reflection in the starry stream--
1243,EARLY SUMMER,"Yes, yes, ah, yes! its presence shall watch o'er us,"
1244,EARLY SUMMER,"Night, night, to-night, and every night we dream."
1245,EARLY SUMMER,
1246,EARLY SUMMER,
1247,EARLY SUMMER,9
1248,EARLY SUMMER,
1249,EARLY SUMMER,_Homeward through flowers; she speaks:_
1250,EARLY SUMMER,
1251,EARLY SUMMER,Behold the offerings of the common hills!
1252,EARLY SUMMER,Whose lowly names have made them three times dear:
1253,EARLY SUMMER,The evening-primrose and dim multitudes
1254,EARLY SUMMER,Of violets that sky the mossy dells
1255,EARLY SUMMER,With heaven's ambrosial blue; dew-dripping plumes
1256,EARLY SUMMER,Of mauve lobelias; and the red-stained cups
1257,EARLY SUMMER,"Of blackberry-lilies all along the creek,"
1258,EARLY SUMMER,"Where, lulled, the freckled silence sleeps, and vague"
1259,EARLY SUMMER,
1260,EARLY SUMMER,"The water flows; where, at high noon, the cows"
1261,EARLY SUMMER,"Wade knee-deep, and the heat is honied with"
1262,EARLY SUMMER,"The drone of drowsy bees. The fleur-de-lis,"
1263,EARLY SUMMER,"Blue, streaked with crystal like a summer day,"
1264,EARLY SUMMER,"The monkey-flower and the touch-me-not,"
1265,EARLY SUMMER,All frailly scented and familiar as
1266,EARLY SUMMER,Fair baby faces and soft infant eyes.
1267,EARLY SUMMER,
1268,EARLY SUMMER,Simple suggestions of a life most fair!
1269,EARLY SUMMER,"You whisper me of love and untaught faith,"
1270,EARLY SUMMER,"Whose habitation is within the soul,"
1271,EARLY SUMMER,"Not of the Earth, yet for the Earth indeed...."
1272,EARLY SUMMER,"What is it halcyons my heart? makes calm,"
1273,EARLY SUMMER,"With calmness not of wisdom, all my soul"
1274,EARLY SUMMER,To-night?--Is't love? or faith? or both?--
1275,EARLY SUMMER,The lore of all the world is less than these
1276,EARLY SUMMER,"Simple suggestions of a life most fair,"
1277,EARLY SUMMER,And love most sweet; that I have learned to know!
1278,EARLY SUMMER,
1279,EARLY SUMMER,
1280,EARLY SUMMER,10
1281,EARLY SUMMER,
1282,EARLY SUMMER,"_He speaks, musingly._"
1283,EARLY SUMMER,
1284,EARLY SUMMER,"Yes, I have known its being so;"
1285,EARLY SUMMER,Long ago was I seeing so--
1286,EARLY SUMMER,"Beckoning on to a fairer land,"
1287,EARLY SUMMER,Out of the flowers it waved its hand;
1288,EARLY SUMMER,Bidding me on to life and love;
1289,EARLY SUMMER,Life with the hope of the love thereof.
1290,EARLY SUMMER,
1291,EARLY SUMMER,"What is the value of knowing it,"
1292,EARLY SUMMER,If you are shy in showing it?--
1293,EARLY SUMMER,"Need of the earth unfolds the flower,"
1294,EARLY SUMMER,Dewy sweet at the proper hour;
1295,EARLY SUMMER,And in the world of the human heart
1296,EARLY SUMMER,Love is the flower's counterpart.
1297,EARLY SUMMER,
1298,EARLY SUMMER,"So when the soul is heedable,"
1299,EARLY SUMMER,Then is the heart made readable--
1300,EARLY SUMMER,I in the book of your heart have read
1301,EARLY SUMMER,Words that are truer than truth has said;
1302,EARLY SUMMER,"Measures of love, the spirit's song,"
1303,EARLY SUMMER,Writ of your soul to haunt me long.
1304,EARLY SUMMER,
1305,EARLY SUMMER,Love can hear each laudable
1306,EARLY SUMMER,"Thought of the loved made audible,"
1307,EARLY SUMMER,"Spoken in wonder, or bliss, or pain,"
1308,EARLY SUMMER,And re-echo it back again;
1309,EARLY SUMMER,"Ever responsive, ever awake,"
1310,EARLY SUMMER,Ever replying with ache for ache.
1311,EARLY SUMMER,
1312,EARLY SUMMER,
1313,EARLY SUMMER,11
1314,EARLY SUMMER,
1315,EARLY SUMMER,"_She speaks, dreamily._"
1316,EARLY SUMMER,
1317,EARLY SUMMER,Earth gives its flowers to us
1318,EARLY SUMMER,"And heaven its stars. Indeed,"
1319,EARLY SUMMER,"These are as lips that woo us,"
1320,EARLY SUMMER,"Those are as lights that lead,"
1321,EARLY SUMMER,"With love that doth pursue us,"
1322,EARLY SUMMER,With hope that still doth speed.
1323,EARLY SUMMER,
1324,EARLY SUMMER,"Yet shall the flowers lie riven,"
1325,EARLY SUMMER,And lips forget to kiss;
1326,EARLY SUMMER,"The stars fade out of heaven,"
1327,EARLY SUMMER,And lights lead us amiss--
1328,EARLY SUMMER,As love for which we've striven;
1329,EARLY SUMMER,As hope that promises.

1333,EARLY SUMMER,
1334,EARLY SUMMER,"_He laughs, wishing to dispel her seriousness:_"
1335,EARLY SUMMER,
1336,EARLY SUMMER,"If love I have had of you, you had of me,"
1337,EARLY SUMMER,Then doubtless our loving were over;
1338,EARLY SUMMER,"One would be less than the other, you see;"
1339,EARLY SUMMER,Since what you returned to your lover
1340,EARLY SUMMER,Were only his own; and--
1341,EARLY SUMMER,
1342,EARLY SUMMER,
1343,EARLY SUMMER,13
1344,EARLY SUMMER,
1345,EARLY SUMMER,"_She interrupts him, speaking impetuously:_"
1346,EARLY SUMMER,
1347,EARLY SUMMER,"But if I lose you, if you part with me,"
1348,EARLY SUMMER,I will not love you less
1349,EARLY SUMMER,Loving so much now. If there is to be
1350,EARLY SUMMER,"A parting and distress,--"
1351,EARLY SUMMER,What will avail to comfort or reprieve
1352,EARLY SUMMER,The soul that's anguished most?--
1353,EARLY SUMMER,"The knowledge that it once possessed, perceive,"
1354,EARLY SUMMER,The love that it has lost.
1355,EARLY SUMMER,"You must acknowledge, under sun and moon"
1356,EARLY SUMMER,All that we feel is old;
1357,EARLY SUMMER,Let morning flutter from night's brown cocoon
1358,EARLY SUMMER,Wide wings of flaxen gold;
1359,EARLY SUMMER,"The moon split through the darkness, soaring o'er,"
1360,EARLY SUMMER,"Like some great moth and white,"
1361,EARLY SUMMER,These have been seen a myriad times before
1362,EARLY SUMMER,And with the same delight.--
1363,EARLY SUMMER,So 'tis with love--how old yet new it is!--
1364,EARLY SUMMER,"This only should we heed,--"
1365,EARLY SUMMER,"To once have known, to once have felt love's bliss,"
1366,EARLY SUMMER,Is to be rich indeed.--
1367,EARLY SUMMER,"Whether we win or lose, we lose or win,"
1368,EARLY SUMMER,Within our gain or loss
1369,EARLY SUMMER,"Some purpose lies, some end unseen of sin,"
1370,EARLY SUMMER,Beyond our crown or cross.
1371,EARLY SUMMER,

1374,EARLY SUMMER,
1375,EARLY SUMMER,"_Nearing home, he speaks._"
1376,EARLY SUMMER,
1377,EARLY SUMMER,"True, true!--Perhaps it would be best"
1378,EARLY SUMMER,To be that star within the west;
1379,EARLY SUMMER,"Above the earth, within the skies,"
1380,EARLY SUMMER,Yet shining in your own blue eyes.
1381,EARLY SUMMER,
1382,EARLY SUMMER,"Or, haply, better here to blow"
1383,EARLY SUMMER,A flower beneath your window low;
1384,EARLY SUMMER,"That, brief of life and frail and fair,"
1385,EARLY SUMMER,Finds yet a heaven in your hair.
1386,EARLY SUMMER,
1387,EARLY SUMMER,"Or well, perhaps, to be the breeze"
1388,EARLY SUMMER,That sighs its soul out to the trees;
1389,EARLY SUMMER,"A voice, a breath of rain or drouth,"
1390,EARLY SUMMER,That has its wild will with your mouth.
1391,EARLY SUMMER,
1392,EARLY SUMMER,These thing I long to be. I long
1393,EARLY SUMMER,To be the burthen of some song
1394,EARLY SUMMER,"You love to sing; a melody,"
1395,EARLY SUMMER,Sure of sweet immortality.
1396,EARLY SUMMER,
1397,EARLY SUMMER,

1399,EARLY SUMMER,
1400,EARLY SUMMER,_At the gate. She speaks._
1401,EARLY SUMMER,
1402,EARLY SUMMER,Sunday shall we ride together?--
1403,EARLY SUMMER,"Not the root-rough, rambling way"
1404,EARLY SUMMER,"Through the wood we went that day,"
1405,EARLY SUMMER,In last summer's sultry weather.
1406,EARLY SUMMER,
1407,EARLY SUMMER,"Past the Methodist camp-meeting,"
1408,EARLY SUMMER,Where religion helped the hymn
1409,EARLY SUMMER,Gather volume; and a slim
1410,EARLY SUMMER,"Minister, with textful greeting"
1411,EARLY SUMMER,
1412,EARLY SUMMER,Welcomed us and still expounded.--
1413,EARLY SUMMER,From the service on the hill
1414,EARLY SUMMER,We had gone three hills and still
1415,EARLY SUMMER,Very near the singing sounded.
1416,EARLY SUMMER,
1417,EARLY SUMMER,Nor that road through weed and berry
1418,EARLY SUMMER,Drowsy days led me and you
1419,EARLY SUMMER,"To the old-time barbecue,"
1420,EARLY SUMMER,Where the country-side made merry.
1421,EARLY SUMMER,
1422,EARLY SUMMER,Dusty vehicles together;
1423,EARLY SUMMER,Darkies with the horses near
1424,EARLY SUMMER,Tied to trees; the atmosphere
1425,EARLY SUMMER,Redolent of bark and leather.
1426,EARLY SUMMER,
1427,EARLY SUMMER,As we went the homeward journey
1428,EARLY SUMMER,"You exclaimed,--""They intermix"
1429,EARLY SUMMER,Pleasure there with politics.
1430,EARLY SUMMER,"It reminds me of a tourney."""
1431,EARLY SUMMER,
1432,EARLY SUMMER,"And the fiddles!--through the thickets,"
1433,EARLY SUMMER,How the wind brought from the hill
1434,EARLY SUMMER,Remnants of the old quadrille!--
1435,EARLY SUMMER,It was like the drone of crickets....
1436,EARLY SUMMER,
1437,EARLY SUMMER,Neither road. The shady quiet
1438,EARLY SUMMER,"Of that path by beech and birch,"
1439,EARLY SUMMER,Winding to the ruined church
1440,EARLY SUMMER,Near the stream that sparkles by it.
1441,EARLY SUMMER,
1442,EARLY SUMMER,Where the silent Sundays listen
1443,EARLY SUMMER,For the preacher--Love--we bring
1444,EARLY SUMMER,In our hearts to preach and sing
1445,EARLY SUMMER,Week-day shade to Sabbath glisten.
1446,EARLY SUMMER,

1449,EARLY SUMMER,
1450,EARLY SUMMER,"_He, at parting:_"
1451,EARLY SUMMER,
1452,EARLY SUMMER,"Yes, to-morrow. Early morn.--"
1453,EARLY SUMMER,When the House of Day uncloses
1454,EARLY SUMMER,"Portals that the stars adorn,--"
1455,EARLY SUMMER,Whence Light's golden presence throws his
1456,EARLY SUMMER,"Fiery lilies, burning roses"
1457,EARLY SUMMER,"On the world,--how good to ride"
1458,EARLY SUMMER,With one's sweetheart at one's side!
1459,EARLY SUMMER,
1460,EARLY SUMMER,So to-morrow we will ride
1461,EARLY SUMMER,To the wood's cathedral places;
1462,EARLY SUMMER,"Where the prayer-like wildflowers hide,"
1463,EARLY SUMMER,Sweet religion in their faces;
1464,EARLY SUMMER,"Where, in truest, untaught phrases,"
1465,EARLY SUMMER,"Worship in each rhythmic word,"
1466,EARLY SUMMER,God is praised by many a bird.
1467,EARLY SUMMER,
1468,EARLY SUMMER,"Look above you.--Pearly white,"
1469,EARLY SUMMER,Star on star now crystallizes
1470,EARLY SUMMER,Out of darkness; and the night
1471,EARLY SUMMER,Hangs them round her like devices
1472,EARLY SUMMER,"Of strange jewels. Vapour rises,"
1473,EARLY SUMMER,"Glimmering, from each wood and dell--"
1474,EARLY SUMMER,"Till to-morrow, then, farewell."

1508,LATE SUMMER,"Deeper to tenderness,"
1509,LATE SUMMER,Sadder the blue of hills that lounge along

1518,LATE SUMMER,"The beech-nuts' burs their little pockets thrust,"
1519,LATE SUMMER,Bulged with the copper of the nuts that rust;
1520,LATE SUMMER,Above the grass the spendthrift spider weaves
1521,LATE SUMMER,A web of silver for which Dawn designs
1522,LATE SUMMER,"Thrice twenty rows of pearls; beneath the oak,"
1523,LATE SUMMER,"That rolls old roots in many gnarly lines,--"
1524,LATE SUMMER,"The polished acorns, from their saucers broke,"

1530,LATE SUMMER,But now it shakes--it breaks; and all the vines
1531,LATE SUMMER,And tree-tops tremble;--see! the wind is here!
1532,LATE SUMMER,Billowing and boisterous; and the smiling day
1533,LATE SUMMER,Rejoices with its clamor. Earth and sky
1534,LATE SUMMER,"Resound with glory of its majesty,"
1535,LATE SUMMER,Impetuous splendor of its rushing by.--
1536,LATE SUMMER,"But on those heights the forest yet is still,"
1537,LATE SUMMER,Expectant of its coming. Far away
1538,LATE SUMMER,Each anxious tree upon each waiting hill
1539,LATE SUMMER,"Tingles anticipation, as in gray"
1540,LATE SUMMER,"Surmise of rapture. Now the first gusts play,"
1541,LATE SUMMER,"Like little laughs, about their rippling spines;"
1542,LATE SUMMER,"And now the wildwood, one exultant sway,"
1543,LATE SUMMER,"Shouts--and the light at each tumultuous pause,"
1544,LATE SUMMER,"The light that glooms and shines,"
1545,LATE SUMMER,Seems hands in wild applause.
1546,LATE SUMMER,
1547,LATE SUMMER,How glows that garden! though the white mists keep
1548,LATE SUMMER,The vagabonding flowers reminded of
1549,LATE SUMMER,"Decay that comes to slay in open love,"
1550,LATE SUMMER,When the full moon hangs cold and night is deep;
1551,LATE SUMMER,"Unheeding still, their happy colors leap"
1552,LATE SUMMER,"And laugh encircled of the scythe of death,--"
1553,LATE SUMMER,"Like lovely children he prepares to reap,--"
1554,LATE SUMMER,Staying his blade a breath
1555,LATE SUMMER,"To mark their beauty ere, with one last sweep,"
1556,LATE SUMMER,He lays them dead and turns away to weep.--
1557,LATE SUMMER,"Let me admire,--"
1558,LATE SUMMER,Ere yet the sickle of the coming cold
1559,LATE SUMMER,"Has mown them down,--their beauties manifold:--"
1560,LATE SUMMER,How like to spurts of fire
1561,LATE SUMMER,"That scarlet salvia lifts its blooms, which heap"
1562,LATE SUMMER,"Yon space of sunlight. And, as sparkles creep"
1563,LATE SUMMER,"Through charring parchment, up that window's screen"
1564,LATE SUMMER,"The cypress dots with crimson all its green,"
1565,LATE SUMMER,The haunt of many bees.
1566,LATE SUMMER,"And, showering down cascaded lattices,"
1567,LATE SUMMER,"That nightshade bleeds with berries; drops of blood,"
1568,LATE SUMMER,In clusters hanging 'mid the blue monk's-hood.
1569,LATE SUMMER,
1570,LATE SUMMER,There in the garden old
1571,LATE SUMMER,The bright-hued clumps of zinnias unfold
1572,LATE SUMMER,Their formal flowers; and the marigold
1573,LATE SUMMER,Lifts its pinched shred of orange sunset caught
1574,LATE SUMMER,"And elfed in petals. The nasturtium,"
1575,LATE SUMMER,"All pungent leaved and bitter of perfume,"
1576,LATE SUMMER,"Hangs up its goblin bonnet, fairy bought"
1577,LATE SUMMER,"From Gnomeland. There, predominant, red,"
1578,LATE SUMMER,"And arrogant the dahlia lifts its head,"
1579,LATE SUMMER,"Beside the balsam's rosy horns of honey,"
1580,LATE SUMMER,"Within the murmuring, sunny"
1581,LATE SUMMER,Dry wildness of the weedy flower bed;
1582,LATE SUMMER,"Where crickets and the weed-bugs, noon and night,"
1583,LATE SUMMER,"Sing dirges for the flowers that soon will die,"
1584,LATE SUMMER,For flowers already dead.--
1585,LATE SUMMER,I seem to hear the passing Summer sigh;
1586,LATE SUMMER,"A voice, that seems to weep,"
1587,LATE SUMMER,"""Too soon, too soon the Beautiful passes by!""--"
1588,LATE SUMMER,If I perchance might peep
1589,LATE SUMMER,"Beneath those leaves of podded hollyhocks,"
1590,LATE SUMMER,"That the bland wind with odorous whispers rocks,"
1591,LATE SUMMER,"I might behold her,--white"
1592,LATE SUMMER,"And weary,--Summer, 'mid her flowers asleep,"
1593,LATE SUMMER,"Her drowsy flowers asleep,"
1594,LATE SUMMER,The withered poppies knotted in her locks.
1595,LATE SUMMER,
1596,LATE SUMMER,
1597,LATE SUMMER,2
1598,LATE SUMMER,
1599,LATE SUMMER,_He is reminded of another day with her._
1600,LATE SUMMER,
1601,LATE SUMMER,"The hips were reddening on this rose,"
1602,LATE SUMMER,"Those haws were hung with fire,"
1603,LATE SUMMER,That day we went this way that goes
1604,LATE SUMMER,Up hills of bough and brier.
1605,LATE SUMMER,This hooked thorn caught her gown and seemed
1606,LATE SUMMER,Imploring her to linger;
1607,LATE SUMMER,Upon her hair a sun-ray streamed
1608,LATE SUMMER,Like some baptizing finger.
1609,LATE SUMMER,
1610,LATE SUMMER,"This false-foxglove, so golden now"
1611,LATE SUMMER,"With yellow blooms like bangles,"
1612,LATE SUMMER,"Was fading then. But yonder bough,--"
1613,LATE SUMMER,"The sumach's plume entangles,--"
1614,LATE SUMMER,Was like an Indian's painted face;
1615,LATE SUMMER,"And, like a squaw, attended"
1616,LATE SUMMER,"That bush, in vague vermilion grace"
1617,LATE SUMMER,With beads of berries splendid.
1618,LATE SUMMER,
1619,LATE SUMMER,"And here we turned to mount that hill,"
1620,LATE SUMMER,Down which the wild brook tumbles;
1621,LATE SUMMER,"And, like to-day, that day was still,"
1622,LATE SUMMER,And soft winds swayed the umbles
1623,LATE SUMMER,Of these wild carrots lawny gray;
1624,LATE SUMMER,"And there, deep-dappled o'er us,"
1625,LATE SUMMER,An orchard stretched; and in our way
1626,LATE SUMMER,Dropped ripened fruit before us.
1627,LATE SUMMER,
1628,LATE SUMMER,"A muffled thud the pippin fell,"
1629,LATE SUMMER,And at our feet rolled dusty;
1630,LATE SUMMER,"A hornet clinging to its bell,"
1631,LATE SUMMER,The pear lay bruised and rusty.
1632,LATE SUMMER,"The smell of pulpy peach and plum,"
1633,LATE SUMMER,"From which the juice oozed yellow,"
1634,LATE SUMMER,"Around which bees made sleepy hum,"
1635,LATE SUMMER,Filled warm the air and mellow.
1636,LATE SUMMER,
1637,LATE SUMMER,"And then we came where, many hued,"
1638,LATE SUMMER,The wet wild-morning-glory
1639,LATE SUMMER,Hung its balloons in shadows dewed
1640,LATE SUMMER,For dawning's offertory.
1641,LATE SUMMER,"With bush and bramble, far away,"
1642,LATE SUMMER,"Beneath us stretched the valley,"
1643,LATE SUMMER,"Cleft of one creek, as clear as day,"
1644,LATE SUMMER,That bickered musically.
1645,LATE SUMMER,
1646,LATE SUMMER,"The brown, the bronze, the green, the red"
1647,LATE SUMMER,Of weed and brier ran riot
1648,LATE SUMMER,"To walls of woods, whose vistas led"
1649,LATE SUMMER,To shadowy nooks of quiet.
1650,LATE SUMMER,Long waves of feathering golden-rod
1651,LATE SUMMER,Ran through the gray in patches;
1652,LATE SUMMER,As in a cloud the gold of God
1653,LATE SUMMER,"Burns, that the sunset catches."
1654,LATE SUMMER,
1655,LATE SUMMER,"And there, above the blue hills, rolled,"
1656,LATE SUMMER,"Like some vast conflagration,"
1657,LATE SUMMER,"The sunset, flaming rose and gold,"
1658,LATE SUMMER,We watched in exultation.
1659,LATE SUMMER,"Then turning homeward, she and I"
1660,LATE SUMMER,Went in love's sweet derangement--
1661,LATE SUMMER,"How different now seem earth and sky,"
1662,LATE SUMMER,Since this undreamed estrangement!
1663,LATE SUMMER,
1664,LATE SUMMER,
1665,LATE SUMMER,3
1666,LATE SUMMER,
1667,LATE SUMMER,_He enters the woods. He sits down despondently._
1668,LATE SUMMER,
1669,LATE SUMMER,"Here where the day is dimmest,"
1670,LATE SUMMER,"And silence company,"
1671,LATE SUMMER,Some might find sympathy
1672,LATE SUMMER,"For loss, or grief the grimmest,"
1673,LATE SUMMER,In each great-hearted tree--
1674,LATE SUMMER,Here where the day is dimmest--
1675,LATE SUMMER,"But, ah, there's none for me!"
1676,LATE SUMMER,
1677,LATE SUMMER,"In leaves might find communion,"
1678,LATE SUMMER,"Returning sigh for sigh,"
1679,LATE SUMMER,For love the heavens deny;
1680,LATE SUMMER,"The love that yearns for union,"
1681,LATE SUMMER,Yet parts and knows not why.--
1682,LATE SUMMER,In leaves might find communion--
1683,LATE SUMMER,"But, ah, not I, not I!"
1684,LATE SUMMER,
1685,LATE SUMMER,My eyes with tears are aching.--
1686,LATE SUMMER,Why has she written me?
1687,LATE SUMMER,And will no longer see?--
1688,LATE SUMMER,"My heart with grief is breaking,"
1689,LATE SUMMER,With grief that this should be--
1690,LATE SUMMER,My eyes with tears are aching--
1691,LATE SUMMER,Why has she written me?
1692,LATE SUMMER,
1693,LATE SUMMER,
1694,LATE SUMMER,4
1695,LATE SUMMER,
1696,LATE SUMMER,_He proceeds in the direction of a stream._
1697,LATE SUMMER,
1698,LATE SUMMER,"Better is death than sleep,"
1699,LATE SUMMER,Better for tired eyes.--
1700,LATE SUMMER,Why do we weep and weep
1701,LATE SUMMER,When near us the solace lies?
1702,LATE SUMMER,"There in that stream, that, deep,--"
1703,LATE SUMMER,"Reflecting woods and skies,--"
1704,LATE SUMMER,Could comfort all our sighs.
1705,LATE SUMMER,
1706,LATE SUMMER,"The mystery of things,"
1707,LATE SUMMER,"Of dreams, philosophies,"
1708,LATE SUMMER,"'Round which the mortal clings,"
1709,LATE SUMMER,_That_ can unriddle these.--
1710,LATE SUMMER,What is't the water sings?
1711,LATE SUMMER,What is't it promises?--
1712,LATE SUMMER,End to all miseries!
1713,LATE SUMMER,
1714,LATE SUMMER,
1715,LATE SUMMER,5
1716,LATE SUMMER,
1717,LATE SUMMER,_He seats himself on a rock and gazes steadily into the stream._
1718,LATE SUMMER,
1719,LATE SUMMER,And here alone I sit and it is so!--
1720,LATE SUMMER,O vales and hills! O valley lands and knobs!
1721,LATE SUMMER,What cure have you for woe?
1722,LATE SUMMER,None that my heart may know!--
1723,LATE SUMMER,The wearying sameness!--yet this thing is so!--
1724,LATE SUMMER,"This thing is so, and still the waters flow,"
1725,LATE SUMMER,The leaves drop slowly down; the daylight throbs
1726,LATE SUMMER,"With sun and wind, and yet this thing is so!--"
1727,LATE SUMMER,"Here, at this culvert's mouth,"
1728,LATE SUMMER,"The shadowy water, flowing towards the south,"
1729,LATE SUMMER,"Seems deepest, stagnant-stayed.--"
1730,LATE SUMMER,What is there yonder that makes me afraid?--
1731,LATE SUMMER,Of my own self afraid?--what is't below?
1732,LATE SUMMER,What power draws me to the striate stream?
1733,LATE SUMMER,What evil or what dream?--
1734,LATE SUMMER,"Me, dropping pebbles in the quiet wave,"
1735,LATE SUMMER,"That echoes, strange as music in a cave,"
1736,LATE SUMMER,Hollow and thin; vibrating in the shade
1737,LATE SUMMER,"Like sound of tears--the shadow of some woe,"
1738,LATE SUMMER,"An ailing phantom that will not be laid,"
1739,LATE SUMMER,"Since this is so, since this sad thing is so."
1740,LATE SUMMER,
1741,LATE SUMMER,"There, in the water, how the lank green grass"
1742,LATE SUMMER,"Mats its rank blades, each blade a crooked kris,"
1743,LATE SUMMER,Making a marsh; 'mid which the currents miss
1744,LATE SUMMER,Their rock-born melodies.
1745,LATE SUMMER,"But there, and there one sees"
1746,LATE SUMMER,"The wide-belled mallow, as within a glass,"
1747,LATE SUMMER,"Long-pistiled, leaning o'er"
1748,LATE SUMMER,"The root-contorted shore,"
1749,LATE SUMMER,As if its own pink image it would kiss.
1750,LATE SUMMER,And there the tangled wild-potato vine
1751,LATE SUMMER,"Lifts conical blossoms, each a cup of wine,"
1752,LATE SUMMER,As pale as moonlight is.
1753,LATE SUMMER,"And there tall gipsy lilies, all a-sway,"
1754,LATE SUMMER,"Their savage, coppery faces, fierce of hue,"
1755,LATE SUMMER,"Dull purple-streaked, bend in inverted view.--"
1756,LATE SUMMER,"And where the stream around those rushes creeps,"
1757,LATE SUMMER,"The dragon-fly, in endless error, keeps"
1758,LATE SUMMER,Sewing the pale gold gown of day
1759,LATE SUMMER,With tangled stitches of a burning blue:
1760,LATE SUMMER,"Its brilliant body seems a needle fine,"
1761,LATE SUMMER,A thread of azure ray.
1762,LATE SUMMER,But here below me where my pensive shade
1763,LATE SUMMER,"Looks up at me, the stale stream stagnant lies,"
1764,LATE SUMMER,"Deep, dark, but clear and silent; save the hiss"
1765,LATE SUMMER,Of bursting bubbles in the spawny ooze.--
1766,LATE SUMMER,All flowers here refuse
1767,LATE SUMMER,"To grow or blossom; beauties, too, are few,"
1768,LATE SUMMER,That haunt its depths: no glittering minnows braid
1769,LATE SUMMER,Its languid crystal; and no gravels strew
1770,LATE SUMMER,With colored orbs its bottom. Half afraid
1771,LATE SUMMER,I shrink from my own eyes
1772,LATE SUMMER,There in its cairngorm skies--
1773,LATE SUMMER,"I know not why, and yet it seems 'tis this:--"
1774,LATE SUMMER,
1775,LATE SUMMER,I know not what--but where the kildees wade
1776,LATE SUMMER,"Slim in the foamy scum,"
1777,LATE SUMMER,"From that direction hither doth it come,"
1778,LATE SUMMER,And makes my heart afraid.
1779,LATE SUMMER,"Nearer it draws to where those low rocks ail,"
1780,LATE SUMMER,Warm rocks on which some water-snake hath clomb
1781,LATE SUMMER,"To bask its spotted body, coiling numb.--"
1782,LATE SUMMER,"At first it seemed a prism on the grail,"
1783,LATE SUMMER,"A bubble's prism yonder; then a trail,"
1784,LATE SUMMER,"An angled sparkle in a shadow, swayed"
1785,LATE SUMMER,"Frog-like through deeps, to crouch a flaccid, pale,"
1786,LATE SUMMER,"Squat bulk below.... Reflected trees and skies,"
1787,LATE SUMMER,"And breeze-blown clouds that lounge at sunny loss,"
1788,LATE SUMMER,"Seem in its stolid eyes,"
1789,LATE SUMMER,Deep down--the dim disguise
1790,LATE SUMMER,"Of something ghoulish there, whose features fail,"
1791,LATE SUMMER,"Then come again in rhythmic waviness,"
1792,LATE SUMMER,With arms like tentacles that seem to press
1793,LATE SUMMER,"Up towards me. Limbs that writhe, and fade,"
1794,LATE SUMMER,"And clench--tough limbs, that twist and cross"
1795,LATE SUMMER,Through flabby hair like smoky moss.
1796,LATE SUMMER,
1797,LATE SUMMER,How horrible to see this thing at night!
1798,LATE SUMMER,Or when the sunset slants its brimstone light
1799,LATE SUMMER,"Above the water! when, in phantom flight,"
1800,LATE SUMMER,"The will-o'-the-wisps, perhaps, above it reel."
1801,LATE SUMMER,"Then haply would it rise, a rotting green,"
1802,LATE SUMMER,"Up, up, and gather me with arms of steel,"
1803,LATE SUMMER,"Soft steel, and drag me where the wave is white,"
1804,LATE SUMMER,"Beneath that boulder there, that plants a keel"
1805,LATE SUMMER,"Against the ripple there, a shoulder lean.--"
1806,LATE SUMMER,No! no! I must away before 'tis night!
1807,LATE SUMMER,Before the fire-flies dot
1808,LATE SUMMER,The dusk with sulphur blurrings bright!
1809,LATE SUMMER,Before upon yon height
1810,LATE SUMMER,The white wild-carrots vanish from the sight;
1811,LATE SUMMER,"And boneset blossoms, tossing there in clusters,"
1812,LATE SUMMER,"Fade to a ridge, a streak of ghostly lustres."
1813,LATE SUMMER,"And in yon sunlit spot,"
1814,LATE SUMMER,That cedar tree is not!--
1815,LATE SUMMER,"But a huge cap instead, that, half-asleep,"
1816,LATE SUMMER,Some giant dropped while driving home his sheep.
1817,LATE SUMMER,And 'mid those fallow browns
1818,LATE SUMMER,"And russet grays, the fragrant peak"
1819,LATE SUMMER,"Of yonder timothy stack,"
1820,LATE SUMMER,"Is not a stack, but something hideous, black,"
1821,LATE SUMMER,"That threatens and, grotesquely demon, frowns."
1822,LATE SUMMER,
1823,LATE SUMMER,I must away from here.--
1824,LATE SUMMER,Already dusk draws near.
1825,LATE SUMMER,The owlet's dolorous hoot
1826,LATE SUMMER,Sounds quavering as a gnome's wild flute;
1827,LATE SUMMER,"The toad, within the wet,"
1828,LATE SUMMER,Begins to tune its goblin flageolet.
1829,LATE SUMMER,The slow sun sinks behind
1830,LATE SUMMER,"Those hills; and like a withered cheek,"
1831,LATE SUMMER,"Distorted there, the spectral moon's defined"
1832,LATE SUMMER,Above those trees; above that mass of vines
1833,LATE SUMMER,"That, like a wrecked appentice, roofs those pines.--"
1834,LATE SUMMER,"Oh, I am faint and weak.--"
1835,LATE SUMMER,"I must away, away,"
1836,LATE SUMMER,Before the close of day!--
1837,LATE SUMMER,Already at my back
1838,LATE SUMMER,I feel the woods grow black;
1839,LATE SUMMER,"And sense the evening wind,"
1840,LATE SUMMER,"Guttural and gaunt and blind,"
1841,LATE SUMMER,Snarling behind me like a were-wolf pack.--
1842,LATE SUMMER,"When will it cease to pierce,"
1843,LATE SUMMER,"This anguish dull and fierce,"
1844,LATE SUMMER,At heart and soul? when will it let me go?--
1845,LATE SUMMER,
1846,LATE SUMMER,"At last, with footsteps slow,"
1847,LATE SUMMER,"With half averted cheek,"
1848,LATE SUMMER,"I've reached this woodland creek,"
1849,LATE SUMMER,Far from that place of fear;
1850,LATE SUMMER,And still I seem to hear
1851,LATE SUMMER,A dripping footstep near;
1852,LATE SUMMER,A gurgling voice dim glimmering at my ear.
1853,LATE SUMMER,"I try to fly!--I can not!--yes, and no!--"
1854,LATE SUMMER,"What horror holds me!--God! that obscene, slow,"
1855,LATE SUMMER,Sure mastering chimera there
1856,LATE SUMMER,"Has yet some horrible feeler round my neck,"
1857,LATE SUMMER,Or in my scattered hair!--
1858,LATE SUMMER,Off! off! thou devil's coil!--
1859,LATE SUMMER,"The waters, thrashing, boil--"
1860,LATE SUMMER,Once more I'm free! once more I'm free!
1861,LATE SUMMER,"Glad of that firefly fleck,"
1862,LATE SUMMER,"That, like a lamp of golden fairy oil,"
1863,LATE SUMMER,Lights me the way I flee.--
1864,LATE SUMMER,"No more I stare, magnetic-fixed; nor reck,"
1865,LATE SUMMER,Nor little care to foil
1866,LATE SUMMER,The madness there! the murder there! that slips
1867,LATE SUMMER,"Back to its lair of slime, that seeps and drips,"
1868,LATE SUMMER,That sought in vain to fasten on my lips.
1869,LATE SUMMER,
1870,LATE SUMMER,
1871,LATE SUMMER,6
1872,LATE SUMMER,
1873,LATE SUMMER,"_Taking a letter from his pocket, he hurries away._"
1874,LATE SUMMER,
1875,LATE SUMMER,What can it mean for me? What have I done to her?
1876,LATE SUMMER,"I, in our season of love as a sun to her:"
1877,LATE SUMMER,"She, all its heaven of silvery, numberful"
1878,LATE SUMMER,Stars and its moon shining golden and slumberful;
1879,LATE SUMMER,"Who on my life, that was thorny and lowery,"
1880,LATE SUMMER,Gazed--and made beautiful; smiled--and made flowery.
1881,LATE SUMMER,"She, to my heart and my soul a divinity!"
1882,LATE SUMMER,"She, who--I dreamed!--seemed my spirit's affinity!--"
1883,LATE SUMMER,What have I done to her? what have I done?
1884,LATE SUMMER,
1885,LATE SUMMER,What can she mean by this?--what have I said to her!
1886,LATE SUMMER,"I, who have idolized, worshipped, and pled to her;"
1887,LATE SUMMER,"Sung for her, laughed for her, sorrowed and sighed for her;"
1888,LATE SUMMER,Lived for her only; would gladly have died for her!
1889,LATE SUMMER,See!--she has written me thus! she has written me....
1890,LATE SUMMER,Sooner would dagger or serpent had smitten me!--
1891,LATE SUMMER,"Would you had shriveled ere ever you'd read of it,"
1892,LATE SUMMER,"Eyes, that are wide to the bitterest dread of it!--"
1893,LATE SUMMER,What have I said to her? what have I said?
1894,LATE SUMMER,
1895,LATE SUMMER,"What shall I make of it? I who am trembling,"
1896,LATE SUMMER,"Dreading to lose her.--A moth, the dissembling"
1897,LATE SUMMER,"Flame of the candle attracts with its guttering,"
1898,LATE SUMMER,"Flattering on till its body lies fluttering,"
1899,LATE SUMMER,"Scorched in the summer night.--Foolish, importunate,"
1900,LATE SUMMER,"Why did'st thou leave the cool flowers, unfortunate!--"
1901,LATE SUMMER,"Such has she been to me making me such to her,"
1902,LATE SUMMER,"Slaying me, saying I never was much to her!--"
1903,LATE SUMMER,What shall I make of it? what can I make?
1904,LATE SUMMER,
1905,LATE SUMMER,"Love, in thy everglades, moaning and motionless,"
1906,LATE SUMMER,"Look, I have fallen; the evil is potionless."
1907,LATE SUMMER,"I,--with no thought but the heav'n that did lock us in,--"
1908,LATE SUMMER,"Set naked feet 'mid the cottonmouth, moccasin,"
1909,LATE SUMMER,"Under the roses, the Cherokee, eyeing me.--"
1910,LATE SUMMER,"I,--in the sky with the egrets that, flying me,"
1911,LATE SUMMER,"Loosened like blooms from magnolias, rose slenderly,"
1912,LATE SUMMER,White and pale pink; where the mocking-bird tenderly
1913,LATE SUMMER,"Sang, making vistas of mosses melodious;--"
1914,LATE SUMMER,Wandered unheeding my steps in the odious
1915,LATE SUMMER,Ooze and the venom. I followed the wiry
1916,LATE SUMMER,Violet curve of thy star falling fiery--
1917,LATE SUMMER,So was I lost in night! thus am undone!
1918,LATE SUMMER,
1919,LATE SUMMER,Have I not told to her--living alone for her--
1920,LATE SUMMER,Purposed unfoldments of deeds I had sown for her
1921,LATE SUMMER,Here in the soil of my soul? their variety
1922,LATE SUMMER,Endless--and ever she answered with piety.
1923,LATE SUMMER,See! it has come to this--all the tale's suavity
1924,LATE SUMMER,At the ninth chapter grows wretched to gravity;
1925,LATE SUMMER,Cruel as death all our beautiful history--
1926,LATE SUMMER,Close it!--the finis is more than a mystery.--
1927,LATE SUMMER,"Yes, I will go to her; yes, I will speak."
1928,LATE SUMMER,
1929,LATE SUMMER,
1930,LATE SUMMER,7
1931,LATE SUMMER,
1932,LATE SUMMER,_After the last meeting; the day following._
1933,LATE SUMMER,
1934,LATE SUMMER,I seem to see her still; to see
1935,LATE SUMMER,That dim blue room. Her perfume comes
1936,LATE SUMMER,From lavender folds draped dreamily--
1937,LATE SUMMER,One blossom of brocaded blooms--
1938,LATE SUMMER,Some stuff of orient looms.
1939,LATE SUMMER,
1940,LATE SUMMER,I seem to hear her speak; and back
1941,LATE SUMMER,Where lies the sun on books and piles
1942,LATE SUMMER,"Of porcelain and bric-a-brac,"
1943,LATE SUMMER,"A tall clock ticks above the tiles,"
1944,LATE SUMMER,Where Love's framed profile smiles.
1945,LATE SUMMER,
1946,LATE SUMMER,"I hear her say, ""Ah, had I known!--"
1947,LATE SUMMER,I suffer too for what has been--
1948,LATE SUMMER,"For what must be.""--A wild ache shone"
1949,LATE SUMMER,In her sad eyes that seemed to lean
1950,LATE SUMMER,"On something far, unseen."
1951,LATE SUMMER,
1952,LATE SUMMER,And as in sleep my own self seems
1953,LATE SUMMER,Outside my suffering self.--I flush
1954,LATE SUMMER,"'Twixt facts and undetermined dreams,"
1955,LATE SUMMER,And wait as silent as that hush
1956,LATE SUMMER,Of lilac light and plush.
1957,LATE SUMMER,
1958,LATE SUMMER,"Smiling, but suffering, I feel,"
1959,LATE SUMMER,"Beneath that face, so sweet and sad,"
1960,LATE SUMMER,"In those pale temples, thoughts like steel"
1961,LATE SUMMER,Pierce burningly.--I had gone mad
1962,LATE SUMMER,Had I once deemed her glad.--
1963,LATE SUMMER,
1964,LATE SUMMER,"Unconsciously, with eyes that yearn"
1965,LATE SUMMER,To look beyond the present far
1966,LATE SUMMER,"For some faint future hope, I turn--"
1967,LATE SUMMER,"Above her garden, day's fierce star,"
1968,LATE SUMMER,"Vermilion at the window bar,"
1969,LATE SUMMER,
1970,LATE SUMMER,Sank sullenly--like love's own sun--
1971,LATE SUMMER,An omen of our future life.--
1972,LATE SUMMER,And then the memory of one
1973,LATE SUMMER,Rich day she'd said she'd be my wife
1974,LATE SUMMER,Set heart and brain at strife.
1975,LATE SUMMER,
1976,LATE SUMMER,"Again amid the heavy hues,"
1977,LATE SUMMER,"Soft crimson, seal, and satiny gold"
1978,LATE SUMMER,"Of flowers there, I stood 'mid dews"
1979,LATE SUMMER,"With her; deep in her garden old,"
1980,LATE SUMMER,While sunset fires uprolled.
1981,LATE SUMMER,
1982,LATE SUMMER,And now.... It can not be! and yet
1983,LATE SUMMER,To feel 'tis so!--In heart and brain
1984,LATE SUMMER,To know 'tis so!--while warm and wet
1985,LATE SUMMER,"I seem to smell those scents again,"
1986,LATE SUMMER,Verbena-scents and rain.
1987,LATE SUMMER,
1988,LATE SUMMER,"I turn, in hope she'll bid me stay."
1989,LATE SUMMER,Again her cameo beauty mark
1990,LATE SUMMER,Set in that smile.--She turns away.
1991,LATE SUMMER,No word of love! not even a spark
1992,LATE SUMMER,Of hope to cheer the dark!
1993,LATE SUMMER,
1994,LATE SUMMER,That sepia sketch--conceive it so--
1995,LATE SUMMER,A jaunty head with mouth and eyes
1996,LATE SUMMER,"Tragic beneath a rose-chapeau,"
1997,LATE SUMMER,"Silk-masked, unmasking--it denies"
1998,LATE SUMMER,"The look we half surmise,"
1999,LATE SUMMER,
2000,LATE SUMMER,We know is there. 'Tis thus we read
2001,LATE SUMMER,The true beneath the false; perceive
2002,LATE SUMMER,The smile that hides the ache.--Indeed!
2003,LATE SUMMER,"Whose soul unmasks?... Not mine!--I grieve,--"
2004,LATE SUMMER,Oh God!--but laugh and leave....

2008,LATE SUMMER,
2009,LATE SUMMER,_He walks aimlessly on._
2010,LATE SUMMER,
2011,LATE SUMMER,"Beyond those twisted apple-trees,"
2012,LATE SUMMER,"That partly hide the old brick-barn,"
2013,LATE SUMMER,Its tattered arms and tattered knees
2014,LATE SUMMER,A scare-crow tosses to the breeze
2015,LATE SUMMER,Among the shocks of corn.
2016,LATE SUMMER,
2017,LATE SUMMER,"My heart is gray as is the day,"
2018,LATE SUMMER,In which the rain-wind drearily
2019,LATE SUMMER,"Makes all the sounding branches sway,"
2020,LATE SUMMER,And in the hollows far away
2021,LATE SUMMER,The dry leaves rustle wearily.
2022,LATE SUMMER,
2023,LATE SUMMER,And soon we'll hear the far wild-geese
2024,LATE SUMMER,Honk in frost-bitten heavens under
2025,LATE SUMMER,"Arcturus; when my walks must cease,"
2026,LATE SUMMER,And by the fireside's log-heaped peace
2027,LATE SUMMER,I'll sit and nod and ponder.--
2028,LATE SUMMER,
2029,LATE SUMMER,When every fall of this loud creek
2030,LATE SUMMER,Is architectured ice; and hinted
2031,LATE SUMMER,"Brown acres of yon corn stretch bleak,"
2032,LATE SUMMER,"White-sculptured with the snows, that streak"
2033,LATE SUMMER,"The hillsides bitter-tinted,"
2034,LATE SUMMER,
2035,LATE SUMMER,I'll sit and dream of that glad morn
2036,LATE SUMMER,We went down ways where blooms were blowing;
2037,LATE SUMMER,"That dusk we strolled through flower and thorn,"
2038,LATE SUMMER,"By tasseled meads of cane and corn,"
2039,LATE SUMMER,To where the stream was flowing.
2040,LATE SUMMER,
2041,LATE SUMMER,Again I'll oar our boat among
2042,LATE SUMMER,The lily-pads that dot the river;
2043,LATE SUMMER,And reach her hat the grape-vine long
2044,LATE SUMMER,"Strikes in the stream; we'll sing that song,"
2045,LATE SUMMER,And then.... I'll wake and shiver.
2046,LATE SUMMER,
2047,LATE SUMMER,Why is it that my mind reverts
2048,LATE SUMMER,To that sweet past? while full of parting
2049,LATE SUMMER,The present is; so full of hurts
2050,LATE SUMMER,"And heartache, that what it asserts"
2051,LATE SUMMER,Adds only to the smarting.
2052,LATE SUMMER,
2053,LATE SUMMER,How often shall I sit and think
2054,LATE SUMMER,Of that sweet past! through lowered lashes
2055,LATE SUMMER,What-might-have-been trace link by link;
2056,LATE SUMMER,Then watch it gradually sink
2057,LATE SUMMER,And crumble into ashes.
2058,LATE SUMMER,
2059,LATE SUMMER,Outside I'll hear the sad wind weep
2060,LATE SUMMER,"Like some lone spirit, grieved, forsaken;"
2061,LATE SUMMER,Then shuddering to bed shall creep
2062,LATE SUMMER,"And lie awake, or haply sleep"
2063,LATE SUMMER,A sleep by visions shaken.
2064,LATE SUMMER,
2065,LATE SUMMER,Dreams of the past that paint and draw
2066,LATE SUMMER,The present in a hue that's wanting;
2067,LATE SUMMER,"A scare-crow thing of sticks and straw,--"
2068,LATE SUMMER,"Like that just now I, passing, saw,--"
2069,LATE SUMMER,Its empty tatters flaunting.
2070,LATE SUMMER,

2073,LATE SUMMER,
2074,LATE SUMMER,_He compares the present day with a past one._
2075,LATE SUMMER,
2076,LATE SUMMER,The sun a splintered splendor was
2077,LATE SUMMER,"In trees, whose waving branches blurred"
2078,LATE SUMMER,"Its disc, that day we went together,"
2079,LATE SUMMER,'Mid wild-bee hum and whirring buzz
2080,LATE SUMMER,"Of insects, through the fields that purred"
2081,LATE SUMMER,With Summer in the perfect weather.
2082,LATE SUMMER,
2083,LATE SUMMER,So sweet it was to look and lean
2084,LATE SUMMER,To her young face and feel the light
2085,LATE SUMMER,Of eyes that met my own unsaddened!
2086,LATE SUMMER,"Her laugh, that left lips more serene;"
2087,LATE SUMMER,"Her speech, that blossomed like the white"
2088,LATE SUMMER,Life-everlasting there and gladdened.
2089,LATE SUMMER,
2090,LATE SUMMER,Maturing Summer! you were fraught
2091,LATE SUMMER,With more of beauty then than now
2092,LATE SUMMER,Parades the pageant of September:
2093,LATE SUMMER,Where what-is-now contrasts in thought
2094,LATE SUMMER,"With what-was-once, that bloom and bough"
2095,LATE SUMMER,Can only help me to remember.

2099,LATE SUMMER,
2100,LATE SUMMER,_He pauses before a deserted house by the roadside._
2101,LATE SUMMER,
2102,LATE SUMMER,Through iron-weeds and roses
2103,LATE SUMMER,"And ancient beech and oak,"
2104,LATE SUMMER,Old porches it discloses
2105,LATE SUMMER,"Above the weeds and roses,"
2106,LATE SUMMER,The drizzling raindrops soak.
2107,LATE SUMMER,
2108,LATE SUMMER,Neglected walks a-tangle
2109,LATE SUMMER,With dodder-strangled grass;
2110,LATE SUMMER,And every mildewed angle
2111,LATE SUMMER,Heaped with dead leaves that spangle
2112,LATE SUMMER,The paths that round it pass.
2113,LATE SUMMER,
2114,LATE SUMMER,The creatures there that bury
2115,LATE SUMMER,"And hide within its rooms,"
2116,LATE SUMMER,And spidered closets--very
2117,LATE SUMMER,Dim with gray webs--will hurry
2118,LATE SUMMER,Out when the twilight glooms.
2119,LATE SUMMER,
2120,LATE SUMMER,Owls roost in room and basement;
2121,LATE SUMMER,"Bats haunt its hearth and porch,"
2122,LATE SUMMER,And through some paneless casement
2123,LATE SUMMER,"Flit, in the moon's enlacement,"
2124,LATE SUMMER,Or firefly's twinkling torch.
2125,LATE SUMMER,
2126,LATE SUMMER,"There is a sense of frost here,"
2127,LATE SUMMER,And gusts that sigh away.--
2128,LATE SUMMER,What was it that was lost here?
2129,LATE SUMMER,"Long, long ago was lost here?--"
2130,LATE SUMMER,Can anybody say?
2131,LATE SUMMER,
2132,LATE SUMMER,My foot perhaps would startle
2133,LATE SUMMER,Some bird that mopes within;
2134,LATE SUMMER,"Some owl above its portal,"
2135,LATE SUMMER,That stares upon the mortal
2136,LATE SUMMER,As on a thing of sin.
2137,LATE SUMMER,
2138,LATE SUMMER,The rutty road winds by it
2139,LATE SUMMER,This side the dusty toll.--
2140,LATE SUMMER,Why do I stop to eye it?
2141,LATE SUMMER,My heart can not deny it--
2142,LATE SUMMER,The house is like my soul.

2151,LATE SUMMER,Sorrow and sin that wend with me
2152,LATE SUMMER,"Wherever I go. And misery,"
2153,LATE SUMMER,"A gaunt companion, a wretched bride,"
2154,LATE SUMMER,"Goes always with me, side by side."
2155,LATE SUMMER,
2156,LATE SUMMER,"Sick of myself and all the Earth,"
2157,LATE SUMMER,I ask my soul now--is life worth
2158,LATE SUMMER,The little pleasure that we gain
2159,LATE SUMMER,For all our sorrow and our pain?
2160,LATE SUMMER,"The love, to which we gave our best,"
2161,LATE SUMMER,That turns a mockery and a jest?

2175,LATE SUMMER,"Then set one woman high above all others,"
2176,LATE SUMMER,And found her full of flaws.
2177,LATE SUMMER,
2178,LATE SUMMER,Made unseen stars my keblahs of devotion;
2179,LATE SUMMER,Aspired to knowledge and remained a clod:
2180,LATE SUMMER,"With heart and soul, led on by blind emotion,"
2181,LATE SUMMER,The way to failure trod.
2182,LATE SUMMER,
2183,LATE SUMMER,"Chance, say, or fate that works through good and evil;"

2424,LATE AUTUMN,
2425,LATE AUTUMN,"Cool-clad 'neath the pendulous purple of the morning-glory vine,"
2426,LATE AUTUMN,"By the jewel-mine of the pansies and the snapdragons in line,"
2427,LATE AUTUMN,"I waited, and there he met me whose heart was one with mine."
2428,LATE AUTUMN,
2429,LATE AUTUMN,How warm was the breath of the garden when he met me there that day!
2430,LATE AUTUMN,"How the burnished beetle and butterfly flew past us, each a ray!--"
2431,LATE AUTUMN,The memory of those meetings still bears me far away.
2432,LATE AUTUMN,
2433,LATE AUTUMN,"Ah, me! when I think of the handfuls of little gold coins a-mass"
2434,LATE AUTUMN,"My bachelor's-buttons scattered over the garden grass,"
2435,LATE AUTUMN,And the marigolds that boasted their bits of burning brass;
2436,LATE AUTUMN,
2437,LATE AUTUMN,More bitter I feel the autumn tighten 'round spirit and heart;
2438,LATE AUTUMN,"And regret the days remembered as lost--that stand apart,"
2439,LATE AUTUMN,"A chapter holy and sacred, I read with eyes that smart."
2440,LATE AUTUMN,
2441,LATE AUTUMN,"Again to the woods a-trysting by the watermill I steal,"
2442,LATE AUTUMN,"Where the lilies tumble together, the madcap wind at heel;"
2443,LATE AUTUMN,And meet him among the blossoms that the rocks and the trees conceal.
2444,LATE AUTUMN,
2445,LATE AUTUMN,Or the wild-cat grey of the meadows that the ox-eyed daisies dot;
2446,LATE AUTUMN,"Fawn-eyed and tiger-yellow, that tangle a tawny spot"
2447,LATE AUTUMN,Of languid leopard beauty that dozes fierce and hot....
2448,LATE AUTUMN,
2449,LATE AUTUMN,Ah! back again with the present! with winds that pinch and twist
2450,LATE AUTUMN,"The leaves in their peevish passion, and whirl wherever they list;"
2451,LATE AUTUMN,"With the autumn, hoary and nipping, whose mausolean mist"
2452,LATE AUTUMN,
2453,LATE AUTUMN,"Builds wan a tomb for the daylight;--each morning shaggy with fog,"
2454,LATE AUTUMN,"That fits grey wigs to the cedars, and furs with frost each log;"
2455,LATE AUTUMN,"That carpets with pearl the meadow, and marbles brook and bog,--"
2456,LATE AUTUMN,
2457,LATE AUTUMN,Alone at dawn--indifferent: alone at eve--I sigh:
2458,LATE AUTUMN,"And wait, like the wind complaining: complain and know not why:"
2459,LATE AUTUMN,But ailing and longing and pining because I do not die.
2460,LATE AUTUMN,
2461,LATE AUTUMN,"How dull is that sunset! dreary and cold, and hard and dead!"
2462,LATE AUTUMN,"The ghost of the one last August that, deeply rich and red,"
2463,LATE AUTUMN,"Like the wine of God's own vintage, poured purple overhead."
2464,LATE AUTUMN,
2465,LATE AUTUMN,But now I sit with the sighing dead dreams of a dying year;
2466,LATE AUTUMN,"Like the fallen leaves and the acorns, am worthless and feel as sear,"
2467,LATE AUTUMN,With a withered soul and body whose heart is one big tear.
2468,LATE AUTUMN,
2469,LATE AUTUMN,"As I stare from my window the daylight, like a bravo, its cloak puts"
2470,LATE AUTUMN,on.
2471,LATE AUTUMN,"The moon, like a cautious lanthorn, glitters and then is gone.--"
2472,LATE AUTUMN,"Will he come to-night? will he answer?--Oh, God! would it were dawn!"
2473,LATE AUTUMN,
2474,LATE AUTUMN,
2475,LATE AUTUMN,9
2476,LATE AUTUMN,
2477,LATE AUTUMN,_He enters. Taking her in his arms he speaks._
2478,LATE AUTUMN,
2479,LATE AUTUMN,They said you were dying--
2480,LATE AUTUMN,You shall not die!...
2481,LATE AUTUMN,Why are you crying?
2482,LATE AUTUMN,Why do you sigh?--
2483,LATE AUTUMN,Cease that sad sighing!--
2484,LATE AUTUMN,"Love, it is I."
2485,LATE AUTUMN,
2486,LATE AUTUMN,All is forgiven!--
2487,LATE AUTUMN,Love is not poor;
2488,LATE AUTUMN,Though he was driven
2489,LATE AUTUMN,"Once from your door,"
2490,LATE AUTUMN,"Back he has striven,"
2491,LATE AUTUMN,To part nevermore!
2492,LATE AUTUMN,
2493,LATE AUTUMN,Will you remember
2494,LATE AUTUMN,What I forget?--
2495,LATE AUTUMN,"Words, each an ember,"
2496,LATE AUTUMN,That you regret?
2497,LATE AUTUMN,"Now in November,"
2498,LATE AUTUMN,Now we have met?
2499,LATE AUTUMN,
2500,LATE AUTUMN,What if love wept once!
2501,LATE AUTUMN,What though you knew!
2502,LATE AUTUMN,What if he crept once
2503,LATE AUTUMN,Pleading to you!--
2504,LATE AUTUMN,"He never slept once,"
2505,LATE AUTUMN,Nor was untrue.
2506,LATE AUTUMN,
2507,LATE AUTUMN,"Often forgetful,"
2508,LATE AUTUMN,Love may forget;
2509,LATE AUTUMN,"Froward and fretful,"
2510,LATE AUTUMN,"Dear, he will fret;"
2511,LATE AUTUMN,"Ever regretful,"
2512,LATE AUTUMN,He will regret.
2513,LATE AUTUMN,
2514,LATE AUTUMN,Life is completer
2515,LATE AUTUMN,Through his control;
2516,LATE AUTUMN,Living made sweeter
2517,LATE AUTUMN,"Even through dole,"
2518,LATE AUTUMN,Hearing Love's metre
2519,LATE AUTUMN,Sing in the soul.
2520,LATE AUTUMN,
2521,LATE AUTUMN,"Flesh may not hear it,"
2522,LATE AUTUMN,Being impure;
2523,LATE AUTUMN,"And mind may fear it,"
2524,LATE AUTUMN,May not endure;
2525,LATE AUTUMN,But in the spirit--
2526,LATE AUTUMN,There we are sure.
2527,LATE AUTUMN,
2528,LATE AUTUMN,So when to-morrow
2529,LATE AUTUMN,"Ceases, and we"
2530,LATE AUTUMN,"Quit this we borrow,"
2531,LATE AUTUMN,"Mortality,"
2532,LATE AUTUMN,Love chastens sorrow
2533,LATE AUTUMN,So it can see....
2534,LATE AUTUMN,
2535,LATE AUTUMN,Still you are weeping!
2536,LATE AUTUMN,Why do you weep?--
2537,LATE AUTUMN,Are tears in keeping
2538,LATE AUTUMN,With joy so deep?
2539,LATE AUTUMN,Gladness so sweeping?--
2540,LATE AUTUMN,Are you asleep?
2541,LATE AUTUMN,
2542,LATE AUTUMN,"Speak to me, dearest!"
2543,LATE AUTUMN,Say it is true!--
2544,LATE AUTUMN,"That I am nearest,"
2545,LATE AUTUMN,Dearest to you.--
2546,LATE AUTUMN,Smile with those clearest
2547,LATE AUTUMN,Eyes of grey blue.
2548,LATE AUTUMN,
2549,LATE AUTUMN,
2550,LATE AUTUMN,10
2551,LATE AUTUMN,
2552,LATE AUTUMN,_She smiles through her tears; holding his hands she speaks._
2553,LATE AUTUMN,
2554,LATE AUTUMN,"They did not say I could not live beyond this weary night,"
2555,LATE AUTUMN,But now I know that I shall die before the morning's light.
2556,LATE AUTUMN,How weak I am!--but you'll forgive me when I tell you how
2557,LATE AUTUMN,I loved you--love you; and the pain it is to leave you now?
2558,LATE AUTUMN,
2559,LATE AUTUMN,"We could not marry!--See, the flesh, that clothes the soul of me,"
2560,LATE AUTUMN,"Ordained at birth a sacrifice to this heredity,"
2561,LATE AUTUMN,"Denied, forbade.--Ah, you have seen the bright spots in my cheeks"
2562,LATE AUTUMN,"Flush hectic, as before the night the west burns blood-red streaks?"
2563,LATE AUTUMN,
2564,LATE AUTUMN,"Consumption.--""But I promised you my hand""?--a thing forlorn"
2565,LATE AUTUMN,"Of life; diseased!--Oh, God!--and so, far better so, forsworn!--"
2566,LATE AUTUMN,"Oh, I was jealous of your love. But think: if I had died"
2567,LATE AUTUMN,Ere babe of mine had come to be a solace at your side!
2568,LATE AUTUMN,
2569,LATE AUTUMN,"Had it been little then--your grief, when Heaven had made us one"
2570,LATE AUTUMN,In everything that's good on earth and then the good undone?
2571,LATE AUTUMN,"No! no! and had I had a child, what grief and agony"
2572,LATE AUTUMN,"To know that blight born in him, too, against all help of me!"
2573,LATE AUTUMN,
2574,LATE AUTUMN,"Just when we cherish him the most, and youthful, sunny pride"
2575,LATE AUTUMN,"Sits on his curly front, to see him die ere we have died.--"
2576,LATE AUTUMN,"Whose fault?--Ah, God!--not mine! but his, that ancestor who gave"
2577,LATE AUTUMN,Escutcheon to our humble house--a Death's-head and a Grave.
2578,LATE AUTUMN,
2579,LATE AUTUMN,Beneath the pomp of those grim arms I live and may not move;
2580,LATE AUTUMN,"Nor faith, nor truth, nor wealth avail to hurl them down, nor love!"
2581,LATE AUTUMN,How could I tell you this?--not then! when all the world was spun
2582,LATE AUTUMN,Of morning colors for our love to walk and dance upon.
2583,LATE AUTUMN,
2584,LATE AUTUMN,"I could not tell you how disease hid here a hideous germ,"
2585,LATE AUTUMN,Precedence slowly claiming and so slowly fixing firm.
2586,LATE AUTUMN,"And when I broke our plighted troth and would not tell you why,"
2587,LATE AUTUMN,"I loved you, thinking, ""time enough when I have come to die."""
2588,LATE AUTUMN,
2589,LATE AUTUMN,"Draw off my rings, and let my hands rest so ... the wretched cough"
2590,LATE AUTUMN,Will interrupt my feeble speech and will not be put off....
2591,LATE AUTUMN,"Ah, anyhow my anodyne is this--to know that you"
2592,LATE AUTUMN,"Are near me, love me!--Kiss me now, as you were wont to do."
2593,LATE AUTUMN,
2594,LATE AUTUMN,And tell me you forgive me all; and say you will forget
2595,LATE AUTUMN,"The sorrow of that breaking-off, the fever and the fret.--"
2596,LATE AUTUMN,Now set those roses near my face and tell me death's a lie--
2597,LATE AUTUMN,Once it was hard for me to live ... now it is hard to die.

2733,WINTER,Full of parting and unspoken
2734,WINTER,"Heartbreak, faint with agony,"
2735,WINTER,"Like a bird whose heart is broken,"

2737,WINTER,
2738,WINTER,I arose; and in the darkness

2752,WINTER,"And unrealities,--a little while"
2753,WINTER,"Illusions lead me, ending in the smile"
2754,WINTER,Of Death triumphant in a thorny place
2755,WINTER,Among Love's ruined roses and dead dreams.
2756,WINTER,
2757,WINTER,"Since she is gone, no more I see the light,--"
2758,WINTER,"Since she has left all dark,--"
2759,WINTER,Cleave like a revelation through the night.
2760,WINTER,"I wander blindly, filled with fear and fright,"

2762,WINTER,"Of life, where Hope, amid the skulls and bones,"
2763,WINTER,"With weary face, disheartened, wild and white,"
2764,WINTER,Trims her pale lamp with its expiring spark.
2765,WINTER,
2766,WINTER,"Now she is dead, the Soul, naught can o'erawe,--"
2767,WINTER,"Now she has passed from me,--"
2768,WINTER,Questions God's justice that seems full of flaw

2784,WINTER,
2785,WINTER,All day long the woodlands dying
2786,WINTER,"Moaned, and drippings as of grief"

2788,WINTER,Death of flying twig and leaf.
2789,WINTER,

2799,WINTER,
2800,WINTER,"Colors, odors, that are cherished,"

2805,WINTER,"Music,--that all things expresses,"
2806,WINTER,"All for which we've loved or sinned,--"
2807,WINTER,Haply in our treey tresses
2808,WINTER,Once was guesses of the wind....
2809,WINTER,
2810,WINTER,"But I dream!--The dusk, upbraiding,"
2811,WINTER,Deepens without moon or star;
2812,WINTER,"Darkness and my sorrow aiding,"
2813,WINTER,We but fading phantoms are.
2814,WINTER,
2815,WINTER,And within me doubt keeps saying--
2816,WINTER,"""What is wrong? and what is right?"

2829,WINTER,
2830,WINTER,Theirs is a speech which is not speech;
2831,WINTER,A language that is bound
2832,WINTER,To soul-vibrations vague that reach
2833,WINTER,Deeper than any sound.
2834,WINTER,
2835,WINTER,"No words are theirs. They speak through things,"
2836,WINTER,A visible utterance
2837,WINTER,Of thoughts--like those some sunset brings
2838,WINTER,Or withered rose perchance.
2839,WINTER,
2840,WINTER,"The heavens that once, in purple and flame,"
2841,WINTER,"Spake to two hearts as one,"
2842,WINTER,In after years may speak the same
2843,WINTER,To one sad heart alone.
2844,WINTER,
2845,WINTER,Through it the vanished face and eyes
2846,WINTER,"Of her, the sweet and fair,"
2847,WINTER,"Of her the lost, again shall rise"
2848,WINTER,To comfort his despair.
2849,WINTER,
2850,WINTER,And so the love that led him long
2851,WINTER,"From golden scene to scene,"
2852,WINTER,Within the sunset is a tongue
2853,WINTER,To tell him what has been.--
2854,WINTER,
2855,WINTER,"How loud it speaks of that dead day,"
2856,WINTER,The rose whose bloom is fled!
2857,WINTER,"Of her who died; who, clasped in clay,"
2858,WINTER,Lies numbered with the dead.
2859,WINTER,
2860,WINTER,The dead are dead; with them 'tis well

2862,WINTER,No memories haunt their hearts who dwell
2863,WINTER,Within the grave and tomb.
2864,WINTER,

2877,WINTER,I hear the plangent forest beat
2878,WINTER,The tempest with long blatant moans
2879,WINTER,"As of despair, defeat."
2880,WINTER,
2881,WINTER,"And sitting here beyond the storm,"
2882,WINTER,"Alone within the lonely house,"
2883,WINTER,It seems that some mesmeric charm
2884,WINTER,"Hangs over all.--Why, even the mouse,"
2885,WINTER,"That gnawed, has come to harm."
2886,WINTER,
2887,WINTER,"And in the silence, stolen o'er"
2888,WINTER,"All things, I strangely seem to fear"
2889,WINTER,"Myself--that, opening yon door,"
2890,WINTER,"I'd find my dead self drawing near,"
2891,WINTER,With face that once I wore.
2892,WINTER,
2893,WINTER,The stairway creaks with ghostly gusts.
2894,WINTER,The flue moans--'tis a gorgon throat
2895,WINTER,"Of wailing winds. Ancestral dusts,--"
2896,WINTER,That yonder Indian war-gear coat
2897,WINTER,"With gray and spectral crusts,--"
2898,WINTER,
2899,WINTER,"Are trembled down.--Or can it be,"
2900,WINTER,"That he who wore it in the dance,"
2901,WINTER,"Or battle, now fills shadowy"
2902,WINTER,Its wampumed skins? And shakes his lance
2903,WINTER,And warrior plume at me?--
2904,WINTER,
2905,WINTER,Mere fancy!--Yet those curtains toss
2906,WINTER,Mysteriously as if some dark
2907,WINTER,Hand moved them.--And I'd fear to cross
2908,WINTER,The shadow there where lies that spark--
2909,WINTER,A glow-worm sunk in moss.
2910,WINTER,
2911,WINTER,"Outside 'twere better!--Yes, I yearn"
2912,WINTER,To walk the waste where sway and dip
2913,WINTER,The dark December boughs--where burn
2914,WINTER,"Some late last leaves, that drip and drip"
2915,WINTER,No matter where you turn.
2916,WINTER,
2917,WINTER,"Where sodden soil, you scarce have trod,"
2918,WINTER,Fills oozy footprints--but the blind
2919,WINTER,"Night there, tho' like the frown of God,"
2920,WINTER,"Presents no phantoms to the mind,"
2921,WINTER,Like these that have o'erawed.--
2922,WINTER,
2923,WINTER,The months I count: how long it seems
2924,WINTER,"Since summer! summer, when with her,"
2925,WINTER,"There on her porch, in rainy gleams"
2926,WINTER,We watched the flickering lightning stir
2927,WINTER,In heavens gray as dreams.
2928,WINTER,
2929,WINTER,"When all the west, a sheet of gold,"
2930,WINTER,"Flared,--like some Titan's opened forge,--"
2931,WINTER,With storm; revealing manifold
2932,WINTER,"Vast peaks of clouds with crag and gorge,"
2933,WINTER,Where thunder torrents rolled.
2934,WINTER,
2935,WINTER,"Then came the wind; again, again"
2936,WINTER,The lightning lit the world--and how
2937,WINTER,The tempest roared with rushing rain!...
2938,WINTER,"We could not read.--Where is it now,"
2939,WINTER,That tale of Charlemagne?
2940,WINTER,
2941,WINTER,"That old romance, ah me! that we"
2942,WINTER,Were reading? till we heard the plunge
2943,WINTER,"Of summer thunder sullenly,"
2944,WINTER,"And left to watch the lightning lunge,"
2945,WINTER,And winds bend down each tree.--
2946,WINTER,
2947,WINTER,That summer! how it built us there
2948,WINTER,A world of love and necromance!
2949,WINTER,"A spirit-world, where all was fair;"
2950,WINTER,"An island, sleeping in a trance"
2951,WINTER,Of lilied light and air.
2952,WINTER,
2953,WINTER,Where every flower was a thought;
2954,WINTER,"And every bird, a melody;"
2955,WINTER,"And every fragrance, zephyr brought,"
2956,WINTER,Was but the rainbowed drapery
2957,WINTER,Of some sweet dream long sought.
2958,WINTER,
2959,WINTER,"O land of shadows! shadow-home,"
2960,WINTER,Within my world of memories!
2961,WINTER,Around whose ruins sweeps the foam
2962,WINTER,"Of sorrow's immemorial seas,"
2963,WINTER,By whose dark shores I roam!
2964,WINTER,
2965,WINTER,How long in your wrecked halls alone
2966,WINTER,With ghosts of joys must I remain?
2967,WINTER,"Between the unknown and the known,"
2968,WINTER,"Still listening to the wind and rain,"
2969,WINTER,And my own heart's wild moan.

2974,WINTER,_He sits by the slowly dying fire. The storm is heard with increased
2975,WINTER,violence._
2976,WINTER,
2977,WINTER,Wild weather. The lash of the sleet
2978,WINTER,On the gusty casement tapping--
2979,WINTER,The sound of the storm like a sheet
2980,WINTER,My soul and senses wrapping.
2981,WINTER,
2982,WINTER,"Wild weather. And how is she,"
2983,WINTER,Now the rush of the rain falls serried
2984,WINTER,Over the turf and the tree
2985,WINTER,Of the place where she is buried?
2986,WINTER,
2987,WINTER,Wild weather. How black and deep
2988,WINTER,Is the night where the mad winds scurry!--
2989,WINTER,Do I sleep? do I dream in my sleep
2990,WINTER,That I hear her footsteps hurry?
2991,WINTER,
2992,WINTER,Hither they come like flowers--
2993,WINTER,"And I see her raiment glisten,"
2994,WINTER,Like the robe of one of the hours
2995,WINTER,Where the stars to the angels listen.
2996,WINTER,
2997,WINTER,"Before me, behold, how she stands!"
2998,WINTER,"With lips high thoughts have weighted,"
2999,WINTER,"And testifying hands,"
3000,WINTER,And eyes with glory sated.
3001,WINTER,
3002,WINTER,I have spoken and I have kneeled;
3003,WINTER,I have kissed her feet in wonder--
3004,WINTER,"But lo! her lips--they are sealed,"
3005,WINTER,"God-sealed, and will not sunder."
3006,WINTER,
3007,WINTER,"Though I sob, ""Your stay was long!"
3008,WINTER,"You are come,--but your feet were laggard!--"
3009,WINTER,With mansuetude and song
3010,WINTER,"For the soul your death has daggered."""
3011,WINTER,
3012,WINTER,"Never a word replies,"
3013,WINTER,Never to all my weeping--
3014,WINTER,"Only a sound of sighs,"
3015,WINTER,And raiment past me sweeping....
3016,WINTER,
3017,WINTER,I wake; and a clock strikes three--
3018,WINTER,And the night and the storm beat serried
3019,WINTER,Over the turf and the tree
3020,WINTER,Of the place where she is buried.
