4,,"O bony relic of forgotten days, Which, from my bookshelf, dominates the room, Your empty sockets, with sardonic gaze, Follow me weirdly in the deepening gloom! I often think, if sudden speech returned, You might reveal that secret, grisly jest You're grinning at--or tell me what you've learned Of that dark realm to which we're all addressed. "
5,,"By what rude hands were you exhumed, and why Wrenched from your body in its earthy bed? Who knows but such indignity will I Receive at other hands, when I am dead, And, strangely resurrected, may adorn The wall or desk of one as yet unborn! "
