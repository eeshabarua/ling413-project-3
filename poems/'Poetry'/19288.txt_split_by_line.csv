63,PREFACE.,"So far from the first tale in this book being of political motive, it"
64,PREFACE.,"was written among the subjects of it, and read to several of them in"
65,PREFACE.,"1864. Perhaps the only _souvenir_ of refugee and ""skedaddler"" life"
66,PREFACE.,"abroad during the war ever published, its preservation may one day be"
67,PREFACE.,"useful in the socialistic archives of the South, to whose posterity"
68,PREFACE.,slavery will seem almost a mythical thing. With as little bias in the
69,PREFACE.,"second tale, I have etched the young Northern truant abroad during the"
70,PREFACE.,"secession. The closing tale, more recently written, in the midst of"
71,PREFACE.,"constant toil and travel, is an attempt to recall an old suburb, now"
72,PREFACE.,"nearly erased and illegible by the extension of a great city, and may be"
73,PREFACE.,considered a home American picture about contemporary with the European
74,PREFACE.,tales.

136,THE EXILES.,
137,THE EXILES.,"In the latter part of October, 1863, seven very anxious and dilapidated"
138,THE EXILES.,"personages were assembled under the roof of an old, eight-storied"
139,THE EXILES.,"tenement, near the church of St. Sulpice, in the city of Paris."
140,THE EXILES.,
141,THE EXILES.,The seven under consideration had reached the catastrophe of their
142,THE EXILES.,decline--and rise. They had met in solemn deliberation to pass
143,THE EXILES.,"resolutions to that effect, and take the only congenial means for"
144,THE EXILES.,replenishment and reform. This means lay in miniature before a caged
145,THE EXILES.,"window, revealed by a superfluity of light--a roulette-table, whereon"
146,THE EXILES.,the ball was spinning industriously from the practised fingers of Mr.
147,THE EXILES.,"Auburn Risque, of Mississippi."
148,THE EXILES.,
149,THE EXILES.,Mr. Auburn Risque had a spotted eye and a bluishly cold face; his
150,THE EXILES.,"fingers were the only movable part of him, for he performed respiration"
151,THE EXILES.,and articulation with the same organ--his nose; and the sole words
152,THE EXILES.,vouchsafed by this at present were:
153,THE EXILES.,"""Black--black--black--white--black--white--white--black""--etc."
154,THE EXILES.,
155,THE EXILES.,The five surrounding parties were carefully noting upon fragments of
156,THE EXILES.,"paper the results of the experiment, and likewise Master Lees, the"
157,THE EXILES.,"lessee of the chamber--a pale, emaciated youth, sitting up in bed, and"
158,THE EXILES.,"ciphering tremulously, with bony fingers; even he, upon whom disease had"
159,THE EXILES.,"made auguries of death, looked forward to gold, as the remedy which"
160,THE EXILES.,"science had not brought, for a wasted youth of dissipation and"
161,THE EXILES.,incontinence.
162,THE EXILES.,
163,THE EXILES.,They were all representatives of the recently instituted Confederacy.
164,THE EXILES.,"Most of them had dwelt in Paris anterior to the war, and, habituated to"
165,THE EXILES.,"its luxuries, scarcely recognized themselves, now that they were forlorn"
166,THE EXILES.,"and needy. Note Mr. Pisgah, for example--a Georgian, tall, shapely and"
167,THE EXILES.,"handsome, with the gray hairs of his thirtieth year shading his working"
168,THE EXILES.,temples; he had been the most envied man in Paris; no woman could resist
169,THE EXILES.,the magnetism of his eye; he was almost a match for the great Berger at
170,THE EXILES.,"billiards; he rode like a centaur on the Boulevards, and counterfeited"
171,THE EXILES.,Apollo at the opera and the masque. His credit was good for fifty
172,THE EXILES.,thousand francs any day in the year. He had travelled in far and
173,THE EXILES.,"contiguous regions, conducted intrigues at Athens and Damascus, and"
174,THE EXILES.,smoked his pipe upon the Nile and among the ruins of Sebastopol. Without
175,THE EXILES.,"principle, he was yet amiable, and with his dashing style and address,"
176,THE EXILES.,one forgot his worthlessness.
177,THE EXILES.,
178,THE EXILES.,"How keenly he is reminded of it now! He cannot work, he has no craft nor"
179,THE EXILES.,profession; he knew enough to pass for an educated gentleman; not enough
180,THE EXILES.,to earn a franc a day. He is the _protégé_ at present of his
181,THE EXILES.,"washerwoman, and can say, with some governments, that his debts are"
182,THE EXILES.,impartially distributed. He has only two fears--those of starvation in
183,THE EXILES.,"France, and a soldier's death in America."
184,THE EXILES.,
185,THE EXILES.,The prospect of a debtor's prison at Clichy has long since ceased to be
186,THE EXILES.,"a terror. There, he would be secure of sustenance and shelter, and of"
187,THE EXILES.,"these, at liberty, he is doubtful every day."
188,THE EXILES.,
189,THE EXILES.,"Still, with his threadbare coat, he haunts the Casino and the Valentino"
190,THE EXILES.,of evenings; for some mistresses of a former day send him billets.
191,THE EXILES.,
192,THE EXILES.,"He lies in bed till long after noon, that he may not have pangs of"
193,THE EXILES.,hunger; and has yet credit for a dinner at an obscure _cremery_. When
194,THE EXILES.,"this last confidence shall have been forfeited, what must result to"
195,THE EXILES.,Pisgah?
196,THE EXILES.,
197,THE EXILES.,He is striving to anticipate the answer with this experiment at
198,THE EXILES.,"roulette; for he has a ""system"" whereby it is possible to break any"
199,THE EXILES.,"gambling bank--Spa, Baden, Wisbaden or Homburg. The others have systems"
200,THE EXILES.,"also, from Auburn Risque to Simp, the only son of the richest widow in"
201,THE EXILES.,"Louisiana, who disbursed of old in Paris ten thousand dollars annually."
202,THE EXILES.,
203,THE EXILES.,"His house at Passy was a palace in miniature, and his favorite a tragedy"
204,THE EXILES.,"queen. She played at the Folies Dramatiques, and drove three horses of"
205,THE EXILES.,"afternoons upon the Champs Elysées. She had other engagements, of"
206,THE EXILES.,"course, when Mr. Lincoln's ""paper blockade"" stopped Master Simp's"
207,THE EXILES.,"remittances, and he passed her yesterday upon the Rue Rivoli, with the"
208,THE EXILES.,"Russian ambassador's footman at her back, but she only touched him with"
209,THE EXILES.,her silks.
210,THE EXILES.,
211,THE EXILES.,"Simp studied a profession, and was a volunteer counsel in the memorable"
212,THE EXILES.,"case of Jeems Pinckney against Jeems Rutledge. His speech, on that"
213,THE EXILES.,"occasion, occupied in delivery just three minutes, and set the"
214,THE EXILES.,court-room in a roar. He paid the village editor ten dollars to compose
215,THE EXILES.,"it, and the same sum to publish it."
216,THE EXILES.,
217,THE EXILES.,"""If you could learn it for me,"" said Simp, anxiously, ""I would give you"
218,THE EXILES.,"twenty dollars."""
219,THE EXILES.,
220,THE EXILES.,"This, his first and last public appearance, was conditional to the"
221,THE EXILES.,"receipt from his mother, of six thousand acres of land and eighty"
222,THE EXILES.,negroes. It might have been a close calculation for a mathematician to
223,THE EXILES.,"know how many black sweat-drops, how many strokes of the rawhide, went"
224,THE EXILES.,"into the celebrated dinner at the Maison Dorée, wherein Master Simp and"
225,THE EXILES.,"only his lady had thirty-four courses, and eleven qualities of wine, and"
226,THE EXILES.,a bill of eight hundred francs.
227,THE EXILES.,
228,THE EXILES.,"In that prosperous era, his inalienable comrade had been Mr. Andy Plade,"
229,THE EXILES.,"who now stood beside him, intensely absorbed."
230,THE EXILES.,
231,THE EXILES.,"Of late Mr. Plade's affection had been transferred to Hugenot, the only"
232,THE EXILES.,possessor of an entire franc in the chamber. Hugenot was a short-set
233,THE EXILES.,"individual, in pumps and an eye-glass, who had been but a few days in"
234,THE EXILES.,the city. He was decidedly a man of sentiment. He called the Confederacy
235,THE EXILES.,"""ow-ah cause,"" and claimed to have signed the call for the first"
236,THE EXILES.,secession meeting in the South.
237,THE EXILES.,
238,THE EXILES.,"He asserted frankly that he was of French extraction, but only hinted"
239,THE EXILES.,"that he was of noble blood. He had been a hatter, but carefully ignored"
240,THE EXILES.,"the fact; and, having run the blockade with profitable cargoes fourteen"
241,THE EXILES.,"times, had settled down to be a respectable trader between Havre and"
242,THE EXILES.,Nassau. Mr. Plade shared much of the sentiment and some of the money of
243,THE EXILES.,this illustrious personage.
244,THE EXILES.,
245,THE EXILES.,"There were rumors abroad that Plade himself had great, but embarrassed,"
246,THE EXILES.,fortunes.
247,THE EXILES.,
248,THE EXILES.,He was one of the hundred thousand chevaliers who hail the advent of war
249,THE EXILES.,as something which will hide their nothingness.
250,THE EXILES.,
251,THE EXILES.,"""I knew it,"" said Auburn Risque, at length, pinching the ball between"
252,THE EXILES.,"his hard palms as if it were the creature of his will. ""My system is"
253,THE EXILES.,good; yours do not validate themselves. You are novices at gambling; I
254,THE EXILES.,"am an old blackleg."" It was as he had said; the method of betting which"
255,THE EXILES.,he proposed had seemed to be successful. He staked upon colors; never
256,THE EXILES.,"upon numbers; and alternated from white to black after a fixed,"
257,THE EXILES.,undeviating routine.
258,THE EXILES.,
259,THE EXILES.,"Less by experiment than by faith, the others gave up their own theories"
260,THE EXILES.,"to adopt his own. They resolved to collect every available sou, and,"
261,THE EXILES.,"confiding it to the keeping of Mr. Risque, send him to Germany, that he"
262,THE EXILES.,"might beggar the bankers, and so restore the Southern Colony to its"
263,THE EXILES.,wonted prosperity.
264,THE EXILES.,
265,THE EXILES.,"Hugenot delivered a short address, wishing ""the cause"" good luck, but"
266,THE EXILES.,"declining to subscribe anything. He did not doubt the safety of ""the"
267,THE EXILES.,"system"" of course, but had an hereditary antipathy to gaming. The"
268,THE EXILES.,precepts of all his ancestry were against it.
269,THE EXILES.,
270,THE EXILES.,"Poor Lees followed in a broken way, indicating sundry books, a guitar,"
271,THE EXILES.,"two pairs of old boots, and a canary bird, as the relics of his fortune."
272,THE EXILES.,"These, Andy Plade, who possessed nothing, but thought he might borrow a"
273,THE EXILES.,"trifle, volunteered to dispose of, and Freckle, a Missourian, who was"
274,THE EXILES.,"tolerated in the colony only because he could be plucked, asserted"
275,THE EXILES.,"enthusiastically, and amid great sensation, that he yet had three"
276,THE EXILES.,"hundred francs at the banker's, his entire capital, all of which he"
277,THE EXILES.,meant to devote to the most reliable project in the world.
278,THE EXILES.,
279,THE EXILES.,"At this episode, Pisgah, whose misfortunes had quite shattered his"
280,THE EXILES.,"nerves, proposed to drink at Freckle's expense to the success of the"
281,THE EXILES.,"system, and Hugenot was prevailed upon to advance twenty-one sous, while"
282,THE EXILES.,Simp took the order to the adjacent _marchand du vin_.
283,THE EXILES.,
284,THE EXILES.,"When they had all filled, Hugenot, looking upon himself in the light of"
285,THE EXILES.,"a benefactor, considered it necessary to do something."
286,THE EXILES.,
287,THE EXILES.,"""Boys,"" he said, wiping his eves with the lining of a kid glove, ""will"
288,THE EXILES.,"you esteem it unnatural, that a Suth Kurlinian, who sat--at an early"
289,THE EXILES.,"age, it is true--at the feet of the great Kulhoon, should lift up his"
290,THE EXILES.,"voice and weep in this day of ou-ah calamity?"""
291,THE EXILES.,
292,THE EXILES.,"(Sensation, aggrieved by the sobs of Freckle, who, unused to spirits and"
293,THE EXILES.,greatly affected--chokes.)
294,THE EXILES.,
295,THE EXILES.,"""When I cast my eye about this lofty chambah"" (here Lees, who hasn't"
296,THE EXILES.,"been out of it for a year, hides himself beneath the bed-clothes); ""when"
297,THE EXILES.,I see these noble spih-its dwelling obscu' and penniless; when I
298,THE EXILES.,"remembah that two short years ago, they waih of independent"
299,THE EXILES.,"fohtunes--one with his sugah, anotha with his cotton, a third with his"
300,THE EXILES.,"tobacco, in short, all the blessings of heaven bestowed upon a free"
301,THE EXILES.,"people--niggars, plantations, pleasures!--I can but lay my pooah hand"
302,THE EXILES.,"upon the manes of my ancestry, and ask in the name of ou-ah cause, is"
303,THE EXILES.,"there justice above or retribution upon the earth!"""
304,THE EXILES.,
305,THE EXILES.,"A profound silence ensued, broken only by Mr. Plade, who called Hugenot"
306,THE EXILES.,"a man of sentiment, and slapped his back; while Freckle fell upon"
307,THE EXILES.,"Pisgah's bosom, and wished that his stomach was as full as his heart."
308,THE EXILES.,
309,THE EXILES.,"Mr. Simp, who had been endeavoring to recollect some passages of his"
310,THE EXILES.,"address, in the case of the Jeemses, for that address had an universal"
311,THE EXILES.,"application, and might mean as much now as on the original occasion,"
312,THE EXILES.,brought down one of those decayed boots which the _marchand des habits_
313,THE EXILES.,"had thrice refused to buy, and said, stoutly:"
314,THE EXILES.,
315,THE EXILES.,"""'By Gad! think of it, hyuh am I, a beggah, by Gad, without shoes to my"
316,THE EXILES.,"feet, suh! The wuth of one nigga would keep me now for a yeah. At home,"
317,THE EXILES.,"by Gad, I could afford to spend the wuth of a staving field hand every"
318,THE EXILES.,"twenty-fouah houahs. I'll sweah!"" cried Simp in conclusion, ""I call this"
319,THE EXILES.,"hard."""
320,THE EXILES.,
321,THE EXILES.,"""I suppose the Yankees have confiscated my stocks in the Havre"
322,THE EXILES.,"steamers,"" muttered Andy Plade. ""I consider they have done me out of"
323,THE EXILES.,"twenty thousand dollars."""
324,THE EXILES.,
325,THE EXILES.,"""Brotha writes to me, last lettah,"" continued Freckle, who had"
326,THE EXILES.,"recovered, ""every tree cut off the plantation--every nigga run off, down"
327,THE EXILES.,"to old Sim, a hundred years old--every panel of fence toted away--no"
328,THE EXILES.,"bacon in smoke-house--not an old rip in stable--no corn, coon, possum,"
329,THE EXILES.,"rabbit, fox, dog or hog within ten miles of the place--house stands in a"
330,THE EXILES.,mire--mire stands in desert--Yankee general going to conscrip brotha. I
331,THE EXILES.,"save myself, sp'ose, for stahvation."""
332,THE EXILES.,
333,THE EXILES.,"""Wait till you come down to my condition,"" faltered the proprietor,"
334,THE EXILES.,"making emphasis with his meagre finger--""I have been my own enemy; the"
335,THE EXILES.,"Yankees will but finish what is almost consummated now. I tell you,"
336,THE EXILES.,"boys, I expect to die in this room; I shall never quit this bed. I am"
337,THE EXILES.,"offensive, wasted, withered, and would look gladly upon Père la"
338,THE EXILES.,"Chaise,[A] if with my bodily maladies my mind was not also diseased. I"
339,THE EXILES.,"have no fortitude; I am afraid of death!"""
340,THE EXILES.,
341,THE EXILES.,[Footnote A: The great Cemetery of Paris.]
342,THE EXILES.,
343,THE EXILES.,"The room seemed to grow suddenly cold, and the faces of all the inmates"
344,THE EXILES.,became pale; they looked more squalid than ever--the threadbare
345,THE EXILES.,"curtains, the rheumatic chairs, the soiled floor, sashes and wallpaper."
346,THE EXILES.,
347,THE EXILES.,"Mr. Hugenot fumbled his shirt-bosom nervously, and his diamond pin,"
348,THE EXILES.,"glaring like a lamp upon the worn garbs and faces of his compatriots,"
349,THE EXILES.,showed them still wanner and meaner by contrast.
350,THE EXILES.,
351,THE EXILES.,"""Put the blues under your feet!"" cried Auburn Risque, in his hard,"
352,THE EXILES.,"practical way; ""my system will resurrect the dead. You shall have"
353,THE EXILES.,"clothes upon your backs, shoes upon your feet, specie in your pockets,"
354,THE EXILES.,"blood in your veins. Let us sell, borrow and pawn; we can raise a"

366,RAISING THE WIND.,"The million five hundred thousand folks in Paris, who went about their"

368,RAISING THE WIND.,Colony.
369,RAISING THE WIND.,
370,RAISING THE WIND.,Pisgah dropped in at the Chateau des Fleurs to beg a paltry loan from
371,RAISING THE WIND.,"some ancient favorite. The time had been, when, after a nightly debauch,"
372,RAISING THE WIND.,he had placed two hundred francs in her morning's coffee-cup. It was
373,RAISING THE WIND.,"mournful now to mark his premature gray hairs, as, resting his soiled,"

378,RAISING THE WIND.,"""Give me back, Feefine,"" he faltered, ""only that fifty francs I once"

383,RAISING THE WIND.,There was never a _lorette_ who did not love to gamble. She stopped a
384,RAISING THE WIND.,passing gentleman and borrowed the money; the other saw it transferred
385,RAISING THE WIND.,"to Pisgah, with an expression of contempt, and, turning to a friend,"
386,RAISING THE WIND.,called him aloud a withering name.
387,RAISING THE WIND.,
388,RAISING THE WIND.,"Poor Pisgah! he would have drawn his bowie-knife once, and defied even"
389,RAISING THE WIND.,the emperor to stand between the man and himself after such an
390,RAISING THE WIND.,appellation. He would have esteemed it a favor now to be what he was
391,RAISING THE WIND.,"named, and only lifted his creased beaver gratefully, and hobbled"
392,RAISING THE WIND.,"nervously away, and stopping near by at a café drank a great glass of"
393,RAISING THE WIND.,"absinthe, with almost a prayerful heart."
394,RAISING THE WIND.,
395,RAISING THE WIND.,At Mr. Simp's hotel in the Rue Monsieur Le Prince much business was
396,RAISING THE WIND.,transacted after dark. Monsieurs Freckle and Plade were engaged in
397,RAISING THE WIND.,smuggling away certain relics of furniture and wearing apparel.

402,RAISING THE WIND.,"If the mole-eyed concierge should suspect foul play with these, Simp"
403,RAISING THE WIND.,would be turned out of doors immediately and the property confiscated.
404,RAISING THE WIND.,
405,RAISING THE WIND.,Singly and in packages the collateral made its exit. A half-dozen regal
406,RAISING THE WIND.,chemises made to order at fifty francs apiece; a musical clock picked up
407,RAISING THE WIND.,at Genoa for twelve louis; a patent boot-jack and an ebony billiard cue;
408,RAISING THE WIND.,"a Paduan violin; two statuettes of more fidelity than modesty, to be"
409,RAISING THE WIND.,sold pound for pound at the current value of bronze; divers
410,RAISING THE WIND.,"pipes--articles of which Mr. Simp had earned the title of connoisseur,"
411,RAISING THE WIND.,by investing several hundred dollars annually--a gutta-percha
412,RAISING THE WIND.,"self-adjusting dog-muzzle, the dog attached to which had been seized by"
413,RAISING THE WIND.,"H. M. Napoleon III. in lieu of taxes, etc., etc."
414,RAISING THE WIND.,
415,RAISING THE WIND.,Everything passed out successfully except one pair of pantaloons which
416,RAISING THE WIND.,"protruded from Freckle's vest, and that unfortunate person at once fell"
417,RAISING THE WIND.,under suspicion of theft. All went in the manner stated to Mr. Lees'
418,RAISING THE WIND.,"chamber, he being the only colonist who did not hazard the loss of his"
419,RAISING THE WIND.,"room, chiefly because nobody else would rent it, and in part because his"
420,RAISING THE WIND.,"landlady, having swindled him for six or eight years, had compunctions"
421,RAISING THE WIND.,as to ejecting him.
422,RAISING THE WIND.,
423,RAISING THE WIND.,"Thence in the morning, true to his aristocratic instincts, Mr. Simp"
424,RAISING THE WIND.,"departed in a _voiture_ for the central bureau of the Mont de Piete,[B]"
425,RAISING THE WIND.,in the Rue Blanc Manteau. His face had become familiar there of late. He
426,RAISING THE WIND.,"carried his articles up from the curb, while the _cocher_ grinned and"
427,RAISING THE WIND.,"winked behind, and taking his turn in the throng of widows, orphans,"
428,RAISING THE WIND.,"ouvriers, and profligates and unfortunates of all loose conditions, Simp"
429,RAISING THE WIND.,was a subject of much unenviable remark. He came away with quite an
430,RAISING THE WIND.,"armful of large yellow certificates, and the articles were registered to"
431,RAISING THE WIND.,"Monsieur Simp, a French subject; for with such passports went all his"

438,RAISING THE WIND.,
439,RAISING THE WIND.,"He differed from the other colonists, in that they were weak--he was"
440,RAISING THE WIND.,"bad. He spoke several languages intelligibly, and knew much of many"
441,RAISING THE WIND.,"things--art, finances, geography--just those matters on which newly"
442,RAISING THE WIND.,arrived Americans desire information. His address was even fascinating.
443,RAISING THE WIND.,"One suspected him to be a leech, but pardoned the motive for the manner."
444,RAISING THE WIND.,He called himself a broken man. The war had blighted his fair fortunes.
445,RAISING THE WIND.,"For a time he had held on hopefully, but now meant to breast the current"
446,RAISING THE WIND.,no longer. His time was at the service of anybody. Would monsieur like
447,RAISING THE WIND.,to see the city? He knew its every cleft and den. So he had lived in
448,RAISING THE WIND.,"Paris five years--in the same manner, elsewhere, all his life."
449,RAISING THE WIND.,
450,RAISING THE WIND.,A few men heard his story and helped him--one Northern man had given him
451,RAISING THE WIND.,employment; his gratitude was defalcation.
452,RAISING THE WIND.,
453,RAISING THE WIND.,To day he has sounded Hugenot; but that man of sentiment alluded to the
454,RAISING THE WIND.,"business habits of his ancestry, and intimated that he did not lend."
455,RAISING THE WIND.,
456,RAISING THE WIND.,"""Ou-ah cause, Andy,"" he says, with a flourish, ""is now negotiating a"

461,RAISING THE WIND.,"Later in the day, however, Mr. Plade made the acquaintance of an"

463,RAISING THE WIND.,"one day only, sent it straightway to Mr. Auburn Risque."
464,RAISING THE WIND.,
465,RAISING THE WIND.,"A second meeting was held at Lees' the third day noon, when the"
466,RAISING THE WIND.,"originator of the ""system"" sat icily grim behind a table whereon eleven"

468,RAISING THE WIND.,"around, was amazed to note how little the space taken up by so great a"
469,RAISING THE WIND.,sum.
470,RAISING THE WIND.,
471,RAISING THE WIND.,They opened a crevice that Lees might be gladdened with the sight of the
472,RAISING THE WIND.,"gold; for to-day that invalid was unusually dispirited, and could not"
473,RAISING THE WIND.,quit his bed.
474,RAISING THE WIND.,
475,RAISING THE WIND.,"""We are down very low, old Simp,"" said Pisgah, smilingly, ""when either"

477,RAISING THE WIND.,
478,RAISING THE WIND.,"""You will laugh that it was so, a week hence,"" answered Auburn"
479,RAISING THE WIND.,"Risque--""when you lunch at Peters' while awaiting my third check for a"
480,RAISING THE WIND.,"thousand dollars apiece."""
481,RAISING THE WIND.,
482,RAISING THE WIND.,"""I don't believe in the system,"" growled Lees, opening a cold draft from"
483,RAISING THE WIND.,"his melancholy eyes: ""I don't feel that I shall ever spend a sou of the"
484,RAISING THE WIND.,winnings. No more will any of you. There will be no winnings to spend.
485,RAISING THE WIND.,"Auburn Risque will lose. He always does."""
486,RAISING THE WIND.,
487,RAISING THE WIND.,"""If you were standing by at the play I should,"" cried Risque, while the"
488,RAISING THE WIND.,"pock-marks in his face were like the thawings of ice. ""You would croak"
489,RAISING THE WIND.,"like an old raven, and I should forget my reckoning."""
490,RAISING THE WIND.,
491,RAISING THE WIND.,"""Come now, Lees,"" cried all the others; ""you must not see bad omen for"
492,RAISING THE WIND.,"the Colony;"" and they said, in undertone, that Lees had come to be quite"
493,RAISING THE WIND.,a bore.
494,RAISING THE WIND.,
495,RAISING THE WIND.,"They were all doubtful, nevertheless. Their crisis could not be"
496,RAISING THE WIND.,exaggerated. Their interest was almost devout. Three thousand miles from
497,RAISING THE WIND.,"relief; two seas between, one of water and one of fire; at home,"
498,RAISING THE WIND.,"conscription, captivity, death: the calamity of Southerners abroad would"
499,RAISING THE WIND.,"merit all sympathy, if it had not been induced by waste, and unredeemed"

501,RAISING THE WIND.,
502,RAISING THE WIND.,"The unhappy Freckle, whose luckless admiration of the rest had been his"
503,RAISING THE WIND.,"ruin, felt that a sonorous prayer, such as his old father used to make"
504,RAISING THE WIND.,"in the Methodist meeting-house, would be a good thing wherewith to"
505,RAISING THE WIND.,freight Auburn Risque for his voyage. When men stake everything on a
506,RAISING THE WIND.,"chance, it is natural to look up to somebody who governs chances; but"
507,RAISING THE WIND.,"Andy Plade, in his loud, bad way, proposed a huge toast, which they took"

510,RAISING THE WIND.,"Then they escorted Auburn Risque to the Chemin de fer du Nord,[C] and"

524,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,It was a weary day for the Southern Colony. They strolled about town--to
525,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"the Masque, the Jardin des Plantes, the Champ des Mars, the Marché aux"
526,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"Chevaux, and finally to Freckle's place, and essayed a lugubrious hour"

528,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,
529,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"""It is poor fun, Pisgah,"" said Mr. Simp, at last, ""if we remember that"

531,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"thousand."""
532,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,
533,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"The conversation forever returned to Spa and Baden-Baden, and many"
534,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,wagers were made upon the amount of money which Risque would gain--first

536,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,
537,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"At last they resolved to send to Lees' chamber for the roulette-board,"
538,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,and pass the evening in experiment. They drew Jacks for the party who
539,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"should fetch it, and Freckle, always unfortunate, was pronounced the"
540,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"man. He went cheerfully, thinking it quite an honor to serve the Colony"
541,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"in any capacity--for Freckle, representing a disaffected State, had"
542,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"fallen under suspicion of lukewarm loyalty, and was most anxious to"
543,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,clear up any such imputation.
544,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,
545,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,His head was full of odd remembrances as he crossed the Place St.
546,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"Sulpice: his plain old father at the old border home, close and"
547,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"hard-handed, who went afield with his own negroes, and made his sons"
548,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"take the plough-handles, and marched them all before him every Sunday to"
549,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"the plank church, and led the singing himself with an ancient"
550,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"tuning-fork, and took up the collection in a black velvet bag fastened"
551,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,to a pole.
552,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,
553,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"He had foreseen the war, and sent his son abroad to avoid it. He had"
554,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"given Freckle sufficient money to travel for five years, and told him in"
555,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,the same sentence to guard his farthings and say his prayers. Freckle
556,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"could see the old man now, with a tear poised on his tangled eyelashes,"
557,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"asking a farewell benediction from the front portico, upon himself"
558,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"departing, while every woolly-head was uncovered, and the whole"
559,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"assembled ""property"" had groaned ""Amen"" together."
560,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,
561,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,That was patriarchal life; what was this? Freckle thought this much
562,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,finer and higher. He had not asked himself if it was better. He was
563,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"rather ashamed of his father now, and anxious to be a dashing gentleman,"
564,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,like Plade or Pisgah.
565,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,
566,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"Why did he play whist so badly? How chanced it that, having dwelt"
567,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"eighteen months in Paris, he could speak no French? His only _grisette_"
568,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,had both robbed him and been false to him. He knew that the Colony
569,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"tolerated him, merely. Was he indeed verdant, as they had said--obtuse,"
570,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"stupid, lacking wit?"
571,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,
572,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"After all, he repeated to himself, what had the Colony done for him? He"
573,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"had not now twenty francs to his name, and was a thousand francs in"
574,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"debt; he had essayed to study medicine, but balked at the first lesson."
575,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"Yet, though these suggestions, rather than convictions, occurred to him,"
576,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,they stirred no latent ambition. If he had ever known one high
577,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"resolution, the Southern Colony had pulled it up, and sown the place"
578,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,with salt.
579,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,
580,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"So he reached Master Lees' tenement; it was a long ascent, and toward"
581,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,the last stages perilous; the stairs had a fashion of curving round
582,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,unexpectedly and bending against jambs and blank walls. He was quite out
583,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,of breath when he staggered against Lees' door and burst it open.
584,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,
585,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"The light fell almost glaringly upon the bare, contracted chamber; for"
586,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"this was next to the sky and close up to the clouds, and the window"
587,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"looked toward the west, where the sun, sinking majestically, was"
588,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"throwing its brightest smiles upon Paris, as it bade adieu."
589,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,
590,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"And there, upon his tossed, neglected bed, in the full blaze of the"
591,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"sunset, his sharp, sallow jaws dropped upon his neck, his cheeks"
592,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"colorless and concave, his great eyes open wide and his hair unsmoothed,"

597,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,When Freckle had raised himself from the platform at the base of the
598,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"first flight of stairs, down which he had fallen in his fright, he"
599,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,hastened to his own chamber and gave the Colony notice of the depletion
600,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,of its number.
601,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,
602,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"A deep gloom, as may be surmised, fell upon all. Lees had been no great"
603,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"favorite of late, and it had been the trite remark for a year that he"
604,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,was looking like death; but at this juncture the tidings came ominously
605,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"enough. One member, at least, of the Southern Colony would never share"
606,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"the winnings of Auburn Risque, and now that they referred to his"
607,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"forebodings of the morning, it was recalled that with his own demise, he"
608,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"had prophesied the failure of ""the system."""
609,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,
610,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,His end seemed to each young exile a personal admonition; they had known
611,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"him strong and spirited, and with them he had grown poor and unhappy."
612,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"Poverty is a warning that talks like the wind, and we do not heed it;"
613,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"but death raps at our door with bony knuckles, so that we grow pale and"
614,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,think.
615,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,
616,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"They shuddered, though they were hardened young men, so unfeeling, even"
617,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"after this reprimand, that they would have left the corpse of their"
618,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,companion to go unhonored to its grave; separately they wished to do
619,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,so--in community they were ashamed; and Pisgah had half a hope that
620,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"somebody would demur when he said, awkwardly:"
621,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,
622,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"""The Colony must attend the funeral, I suppose. God knows which of us"

625,DEATH IN EXPATRIATION.,"Freckle cried out, however, that he should go, if he were to be buried"

655,THE DESPERATE CHANCE.,"incident of his life, a man who carried a baby and two bowie knives,"
656,THE DESPERATE CHANCE.,teaching him to play old sledge on the cushions of a Washita stage.
657,THE DESPERATE CHANCE.,
658,THE DESPERATE CHANCE.,Thenceforward he was a man of one idea. He held it to be one of the

673,THE DESPERATE CHANCE.,His whole life might have been called a game of cards. He carried a

1026,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1027,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,The Colony would have shouted over Master Lees' coffin at the receipt of
1028,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"such intelligence. They gave a genuine American cheer, nine times"
1029,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"repeated, with the celebrated ""tiger"" of the Texan Rangers, as it had"
1030,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"been reported to them. Mr. Simp read the dispatch to the concierge, who"
1031,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"brightened up, begged his pardon, and hoped that he would forget words"
1032,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,said in anger.
1033,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1034,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"""Madam,"" said Mr. Simp, with some dignity, ""I have suffered and"

1039,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1040,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"""Boys!"" cried Andy Plade, ""let us have a supper! We--that is, you--can"
1041,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"take the telegram to our several creditors, and raise enough upon it to"
1042,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"pass a regal night at the _Trois Frères_."""
1043,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1044,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,This proposition was received with great favor; the concierge gave Simp
1045,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"a hundred francs; he ordered cigars and a gallon of punch, and they"
1046,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,repaired to his room to arrange the details of the celebration.
1047,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1048,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"Freckle gave great offence by wishing that ""Poor Lees"" were alive to"
1049,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"enjoy himself; and Simp said, ""Bigad, sir! Freckle, living, is more of a"
1050,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"bore than Lees, dead."""
1051,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1052,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"They resolved to attend supper in their dilapidated clothes, so that"
1053,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"what they had been might be pleasantly rebuked by what they were. ""And"
1054,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"but for this feature,"" said Andy Plade, ""it would have been well to"
1055,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"invite Ambassador Slidell."" But Pisgah and Simp, who had applied to"
1056,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"Slidell several times by letter for temporary loans, were averse, just"
1057,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"now, to the presence of one who had forgotten ""the first requisite of a"
1058,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"Southern Gentleman--generosity."""
1059,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1060,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"So it was settled that only the Colony and Hugenot were to come, each"
1061,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"man to bring one lady. Simp, Pisgah, and Freckle thought Hugenot a"
1062,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,villain. He had not even attended the obsequies of the lamented Lees.
1063,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"But Andy Plade forcibly urged that Hugenot was a good speaker, and would"
1064,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,be needed for a sentiment.
1065,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1066,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"In the evening a lunch was served by Mr. Simp, of which some young"
1067,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"ladies of the Paris _demi-monde_ partook; the ""Bonnie Blue Flag"" was"
1068,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"sung with great spirit, and Freckle became so intoxicated at two in the"
1069,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,morning that one of the young ladies was prevailed upon to see him to
1070,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,his hotel.
1071,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1072,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,There was great joy in the Latin Quarter when it was known that the
1073,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"Southern Colony had won at Wisbaden, and meant to pay its debts. The"
1074,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"tailors, shoemakers, tobacconists, publicans, grocers and hosiers met in"
1075,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"squads upon corners to talk it over; all the gentlemen obtained loans,"
1076,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"and, as evidence of how liberal they meant to be, commenced by giving"
1077,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,away whatever old effects they had.
1078,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1079,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,A _cabinet_ or small saloon of the most expensive restaurant in Paris
1080,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,was pleasantly adorned for the first reunion of the Confederate exiles.
1081,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1082,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"The ancient seven-starred flag, entwined with the new battle-flag, hung"
1083,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"in festoons at the head of the room, and directly beneath was the"
1084,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,portrait of President Davis. A crayon drawing of the C. S. N. V.
1085,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"Florida, from the portfolio of the amateur Mr. Simp, was arched by two"
1086,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"crossed cutlasses, hired for the occasion; and upon an enormous iced"
1087,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"cake, in the centre of the table, stood a barefooted soldier, with his"
1088,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"back against a pine tree, defying both a Yankee and a negro."
1089,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1090,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,At eleven o'clock P.M. the scrupulously dressed attendants heard a buzz
1091,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,and a hurried tramp upon the stairs. They repaired at once to their
1092,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"respective places, and after a pause the Southern Colony and convoy made"
1093,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,their appearance upon the threshold. With the exception of Pisgah and
1094,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"Hugenot, all were clothed in the relics of their poverty, but their"
1095,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"hairs were curled, and they wore some recovered articles of jewelry."
1096,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,They had thus the guise of a colony of barbers coming up from the gold
1097,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"diggings, full of nuggets and old clothes."
1098,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1099,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"By previous arrangement, the chair was taken by Andy Plade, supported by"
1100,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"two young ladies, and, after saying a welcome to the guests in elegant"
1101,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"French, he made a significant gesture to the chief waiter. The most"
1102,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,luscious Ostend oysters were at once introduced; they lifted them with
1103,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"bright silver _fourchettes_ from plates of Sevres porcelain, and each"
1104,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,guest touched his lips afterward with a glass of refined _vermeuth_.
1105,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"Three descriptions of soup came successively, an amber _Julien_, in"
1106,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,which the microscope would have been baffled to detect one vegetable
1107,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"fibre, yet it bore all the flavors of the garden; a tureen of _potage à"
1108,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"la Bisque_, in which the rarest and tiniest shell-fish had dissolved"
1109,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"themselves; and at the last a _tortue_, small in quantity, but so"
1110,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"delicious that murmurs of ""_encore_"" were made."
1111,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1112,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"Morsels of _viande_, so alternated that the appetite was prolonged--each"
1113,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,dish seeming a better variation of the preceding--were helped toward
1114,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,digestion by the finest vintages of Burgundy; and the luscious _patés de
1115,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,foie gras_--for which the plumpest geese in Bretagne had been invalids
1116,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"all their days, and, if gossip be true, submitted in the end to a slow"
1117,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"roasting alive--introduced the fish, which, by the then reformed"
1118,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"Parisian mode, must appear after, not before, the _entrée_."
1119,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1120,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,A _sole au vin blanc_ gave way to a regal _mackerel au sauce
1121,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"champignon_, and after this dish came confections and fruits _ad"
1122,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"libitum_, ending with the removal of the cloth, the introduction of"
1123,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"cigars, and a _marquise_ or punch of pure champagne."
1124,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1125,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"It was a pleasant evening within and without; the windows were raised,"
1126,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,and they could see the people in the gardens strolling beneath the lime
1127,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"trees; the starlight falling on the plashing fountain and the gray,"
1128,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"motionless statues; the pearly light of the lines of lamps, shining down"
1129,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,the long arcades; the glitter of jewelry and precious merchandise in the
1130,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,marvellous _boutiques_; the groups which sat around the café beneath
1131,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"with _sorbets_ and _glacés_, and sparkling wines; the old women in"
1132,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"Normandie caps and green aprons, who flitted here and there to take the"
1133,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"hire of chairs, and break the hum of couples, talking profane and sacred"
1134,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"love; around and above all, the Cardinal's grand palace lifting its"
1135,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"multitudinous pilasters, and seeming to prop up the sky."
1136,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1137,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"It was Mr. Simp and his lady who saw these more particularly, as they"
1138,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"had withdrawn from the table, to exchange a memory and a sentiment, and"
1139,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,Hugenot had joined them with his most recent mistress; for the latter
1140,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"was particularly unfortunate in love, being cozened out of much money,"
1141,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,and yet libelled for his closeness.
1142,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1143,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"All the rest sat at the table, talking over the splendor of the supper,"
1144,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"and proposing to hold a second one at the famous Philippe's, in the Rue"
1145,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"Montorgueil. But Mr. Freckle, being again emboldened by wine, and"
1146,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"affronted at the subordinate position assigned him, repeatedly cried"
1147,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"that, for his part, he preferred the ""old Latin Quarter,"" and challenged"
1148,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,the chairman to produce a finer repast than Magny's in the Rue
1149,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,Counterscarp.
1150,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1151,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"Pisgah, newly clothed _cap-à-pie_, was drinking absinthe, and with his"
1152,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"absent eyes, worn face and changing hairs, looked like the spectre of"
1153,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,his former self. Now and then he raised his head to give unconscious
1154,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"assent to something, but immediately relapsed to the worship of his"
1155,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"nepenthe; and, as the long potations sent strong fumes to his temples,"
1156,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"he chuckled audibly, and gathered his jaws to his eyes in a vacant grin."
1157,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"The gross, coarse woman at his side, from whom the other females shrank"
1158,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"with frequent demonstrations of contempt, was Pisgah's _blanchisseuse_."
1159,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1160,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"He was in her debt, and paid her with compliments; she is old and"
1161,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"uninviting, and he owes her eight hundred francs. Hers are the new"
1162,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,garments which he wears to-night. Few knew how many weary hours she
1163,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,labored for them in the floating houses upon the Seine. But she is in
1164,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"love with Pisgah, and is quite oblivious of the general regard; for,"
1165,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"strange to such grand occasions, she has both eaten and imbibed"
1166,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"enormously, and it may be even doubted at present whether she sees"
1167,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,anything at all.
1168,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1169,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"She strokes his cloth coat with her red, swollen hands, and proposes now"
1170,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,and then that he shall visit the wardrobe to look after his new hat; but
1171,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"Pisgah only passes his arm about her, and drains his absinthe, and"
1172,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"sometimes, as if to reassure the company, shouts wildly at the wrong"
1173,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"places: ""'At's so, boys!"" ""Hoorah for you!"" ""Ay! capital, gen'l'men,"
1174,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"capital!"" And his partner, conscious that something has happened, laughs"
1175,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"to her waist, and leans forward, quite overcome, as if she beheld"
1176,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,something mirthful over her washboard.
1177,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1178,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,The place was now quite dreamy with tobacco-smoke; Freckle was riotously
1179,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"sick at the window, and Andy Plade, who had been borrowing small sums"
1180,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"from everybody who would lend, struck the table with a corkscrew, and"
1181,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,called for order.
1182,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1183,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"""Drire rup!"" cried Mr. Freckle, looking very attentively, but seeing"
1184,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,nothing.
1185,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1186,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"""I have the honor to state, gentlemen of the Colony, that we have with"

1189,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"and to the South--one who is a friend of yours, and more than a dear"

1195,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,

1197,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1198,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"The glasses rattled an instant, amid iterations of ""Hear! hear!"" and Mr."
1199,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"Hugenot, rising, as it appeared from a bandbox, carefully surveyed"
1200,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"himself in a mirror opposite, and touched his nose with a small nosegay."

1235,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,repudiated? No! that is a slander of our adversaries. But the parallel
1236,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,holds good in that we found ourselves abandoned by the world. Nations

1254,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,the bill. Pisgah and the _blanchisseuse_ were embracing in a spirited

1256,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,remarks were in some way derogatory to himself--wished to toss down his
1257,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,gauntlet.
1258,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1259,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"""The next toast, gentlemen of the Colony,"" said Andy Plade, ""is to be"
1260,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"dispatched immediately by the waiter, whom you see upon my right hand,"
1261,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,to the office of the telegraph; thence to Mr. Risque at Wisbaden:
1262,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1263,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"""'The Southern exiles; doubtless the most immethodical men alive; but"
1264,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"the results prove they have the best system: no _Risque_, no winnings.'"
1265,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1266,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"""You will see, gentlemen,"" continued Mr. Plade, when the enthusiasm had"
1267,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"subsided, ""that I place the toast in this envelope. It will go in two"
1268,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"minutes to Mr. Auburn Risque!"""
1269,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1270,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"The waiter started for the door; it was dashed open in his face, and"
1271,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"splattered, dirty, and travel-worn, Auburn Risque himself stood like an"
1272,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,apparition on the threshold.
1273,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1274,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"""Perdition!"" thundered Plade, staggered and pale-faced; ""you were not to"
1275,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"break the bank till to-morrow."""
1276,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1277,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"The Colony, sober or inebriate, clustered about the door, and held to"
1278,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,each other that they might hear the explanation aright.
1279,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1280,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"Auburn Risque straightened himself and glared upon all the besiegers,"
1281,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"till his pock-marked face grew white as leprosy, and every spot in his"
1282,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,secretive eye faded out in the glitter of his defiance.
1283,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1284,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"""To-morrow?"" he said, in a voice hard, passionless, inflectionless; ""how"
1285,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"could one break the bank to-morrow, when all his money was gone"
1286,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"yesterday?"""
1287,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1288,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"""Gone!"" repeated the Colony, in a breath rather than a voice, and"
1289,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"reeling as if a galvanic current had passed through the circle--""Gone!"""
1290,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1291,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"""Every sou,"" said Risque, sinking into a chair. ""The bank gave me one"
1292,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"hundred francs to return to Paris; I risked twenty-five of it, hopeful"
1293,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"of better luck, and lost again. Then I had not enough money to get home,"
1294,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"and for forty kilometres of the way I have driven a _charette_. See!"" he"
1295,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"cried, throwing open his coat; ""I sold my vest at Compiègne last night,"
1296,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"for a morsel of supper."""
1297,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1298,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"""But you had won seven thousand one hundred francs!"""
1299,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1300,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"""I won more--more than eighteen thousand francs; but, enlarging my"
1301,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"stakes with my capital, one hour brought me down to a sou."""
1302,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1303,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"""The 'system' was a swindle,"" hissed Mr. Simp, looking up through red"
1304,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"eyes which throbbed like pulses. ""What right had you to plunder us upon"
1305,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"your speculation?"""
1306,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1307,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"""The 'system' could not fail,"" answered the gamester, at bay; ""it must"
1308,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"have been my manner of play. I think that, upon one run of luck, I gave"
1309,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"up my method."""
1310,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1311,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"""We do not know,"" cried Simp, tossing his hands wildly; ""we may not"
1312,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"accuse, we may not be enraged--we are nothing now but profligates"
1313,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"without means, and beggars without hope!"""
1314,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1315,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"They sobbed together, bitterly and brokenly, till Freckle, not entirely"
1316,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"sober, shouted, ""Good God, is it that gammon-head, Hugenot, who has"
1317,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"ruined us? Fetch him out from his ancestry; let me see him, I say! Where"
1318,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"is the man who took my three hundred francs!"""
1319,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1320,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"""I wish,"" said Simp, in a suicidal way, ""that I were lying by Lees in"
1321,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,the _fosse commune_. But I will not slave; the world owes every man a
1322,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"living!"""
1323,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1324,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"""Ay!"" echoed the rest, as desperately, but less resolutely."
1325,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1326,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"""This noise,"" said one of the waiters politely, ""cannot be continued. It"
1327,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,is at any rate time for the _salon_ to be closed. We will thank you to
1328,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"pay your bill, and settle your quarrels in the garden."""
1329,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1330,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"""Here is the account,"" interpolated Andy Plade, ""dinner for thirteen"
1331,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"persons, nineteen hundred and fifty francs."
1332,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1333,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"""Manes of my ancestry!"" shrieked Hugenot, overturning the"
1334,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"_blanchisseuse_ in his way, and rushing from the house."
1335,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,
1336,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"""We have not the money!"" cried the whole Colony in chorus; and, as if by"
1337,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"concert, the company in mass, male and female, cleared the threshold and"
1338,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"disappeared, headed by Andy Plade, who kept all the subscriptions in his"
1339,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,"pockets, and terminated by Freckle, who was caught at the base of the"
1340,THE OLD REVELRY REVIVED.,stairs and held for security.

1349,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1350,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"The Colony, as a body, will appear no more in this transcript. The"
1351,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,greatness of their misfortune kept them asunder. They closed their
1352,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"chamber-doors, and waited in hunger and sorrow for the moment when the"
1353,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,sky should be their shelter and beggary their craft.
1354,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1355,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,It was in this hour of ruin that the genius of Mr. Auburn Risque was
1356,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"manifest. The horse is always sure of a proprietor, and with horses Mr."
1357,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,Risque was more at home than with men.
1358,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1359,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""Man is ungrateful,"" soliloquized Risque, keeping along the Rue"
1360,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"Mouffetard in the Chiffoniers' Quarter; ""a horse is invariably faithful,"
1361,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,unless he happens to be a mule. Confound men! the only excellence they
1362,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"have is not a virtue--they can play cards!"""
1363,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1364,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"Here he turned to the left, followed some narrow thoroughfares, and"
1365,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"stopped at the great horse market, a scene familiarized to Americans, in"
1366,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"its general features, by Rosa Bonheur's ""La Foire du Chevaux."""
1367,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1368,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"Double rows of stalls enclosed a trotting course, roughly paved, and"
1369,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"there was an artificial hill on one side, where draught-horses were"
1370,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"tested. The animals were gayly caparisoned, whisks of straw affixed to"
1371,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,the tails indicating those for sale; their manes and forelocks were
1372,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"plaited, ribbons streamed over their frontlets, they were muzzled and"
1373,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,wore wooden bits.
1374,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1375,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"We have no kindred exhibition in the States, so picturesque and so"
1376,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,animated. Boors in blouses were galloping the great-hoofed beasts down
1377,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,the course by fours and sixes; the ribbons and manes fluttered; the
1378,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"whips cracked, and the owners hallooed in _patois_."
1379,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1380,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"Four fifths of French horses are gray; here, there was scarcely one"
1381,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,exception; and the rule extended to the asses which moved amid hundreds
1382,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"of braying mulets, while at the farther end of the ground the teams were"
1383,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"parked, and, near by, seller and buyer, book in hand, were chaffering"
1384,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,and smoking in shrewd good-humor.
1385,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1386,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"One man was collecting animals for a celebrated stage-route, and the"
1387,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,gamester saw that he was a novice.
1388,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1389,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""Do you choose that for a good horse?"" spoke up Risque, in his practical"
1390,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"way, when the man had set aside a fine, sinewy draught stallion."
1391,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1392,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""I do!"" said the man, shortly."
1393,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1394,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""Then you have no eye. He has a bad strain. I can lift all his feet but"
1395,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"this one. See! he kicks if I touch it. Walk him now, and you will remark"
1396,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"that it tells on his pace."""
1397,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1398,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"The man was convinced and pleased. ""You are a judge,"" he said, glancing"
1399,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"down Risque's dilapidated dress; ""I will make it worth something to you"
1400,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"to remain here during the day and assist me."""
1401,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1402,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,The imperturbable gamester became a feature of the sale. He was the
1403,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"best rider on the ground. He put his hard, freckled hand into the jaws"
1404,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"of stallions, and cowed the wickedest mule with his spotted eye. He knew"
1405,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"prices as well as values, and had, withal, a dashing way of bargaining,"
1406,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,which baffled the traders and amused his patron.
1407,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1408,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""You have saved me much money and many mistakes,"" said the latter, at"
1409,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"nightfall. ""Who are you?"""
1410,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1411,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""I am the man,"" answered Risque, straightforwardly, ""to work on your"
1412,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"stage-line, and I am dead broke."""
1413,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1414,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,The man invited Risque to dinner; they rode together on the Champs
1415,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,Elysées; and next morning at daylight the gamester left Paris without a
1416,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,thought or a farewell for the Colony.
1417,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1418,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,It was in the Grand Hotel that Messrs. Hugenot and Plade met by chance
1419,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,the evening succeeding the dinner.
1420,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1421,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""I shall leave Paris, Andy,"" said Hugenot, regarding his pumps through"
1422,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"his eye-glass. ""My ancestry would blush in their coffins if they knew"
1423,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,ou-ah cause to be represented by such individuals as those of last
1424,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"evening."""
1425,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1426,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""Let us go together,"" replied Plade, in his plausible way; ""you cannot"
1427,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,speak a word of any continental language. Take me along as courier and
1428,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"companion; pay my travelling expenses, and I will pay my own board."""
1429,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1430,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""Can I trust you, Suth Kurlinian?"" said Hugenot, irresolutely; ""you had"
1431,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"no money yesterday."""
1432,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1433,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""But I have a plan of raising a thousand francs to-day. What say you?"""
1434,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1435,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""My family have been wont to see the evidence prior to committing"
1436,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"themselves. First show me the specie."""
1437,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1438,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""_Voila!_"" cried Plade, counting out forty louis; ""the day after"
1439,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"to-morrow I guarantee to own eighteen hundred francs."""
1440,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1441,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,It did not occur to Mr. Hugenot to inquire how his friend came to
1442,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"possess so much money; for Hugenot was not a clever man, and somewhat in"
1443,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"dread of Andy Plade, who, as his school-mate, had thrashed him"
1444,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"repeatedly, and even now that one had grown rich and the other was a"
1445,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"vagabond, the latter's strong will and keen, bad intelligence made him"
1446,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,the master man.
1447,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1448,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,Hugenot's good fortune was accidental; his cargoes had passed the
1449,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"blockade and given handsome returns; but he shared none of the dangers,"
1450,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"and the traffic required no particular skill. Hugenot was, briefly, a"
1451,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"favorite of circumstances. The war-wind, which had toppled down many a"
1452,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"long, thoughtful head, carried this inflated person to greatness."
1453,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1454,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"They are well contrasted, now that they speak. The merchant, elaborately"
1455,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"dressed, varnished pumps upon his effeminate feet, every hair taught its"
1456,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"curve and direction, the lunette perched upon no nose to speak of, and"
1457,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"the wavering, vacillating eye, which has no higher regard than his own"
1458,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"miniature figure. Above rises the vagabond, straight, athletic and"
1459,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"courageous, though a knave."
1460,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1461,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"He is so much of a man physically and intellectually, that we do not see"
1462,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"his faded coat-collar, frayed cuffs, worn buttons, and untidy boots. He"
1463,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"is so little of a man morally, that, to any observer who looks twice,"
1464,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,the plausibility of the face will fail to deceive. The eye is deep and
1465,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"direct, but the high, jutting forehead above is like a table of stone,"
1466,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"bearing the ten broken commandments. He keeps the lips ajar in a smile,"
1467,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"or shut in a resolve, to hide their sensuality, and the fine black beard"
1468,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,conceals the massive contour of jaws which are cruel as hunger.
1469,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1470,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"It was strange that Plade, with his clear conception, should do less"
1471,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"than despise his acquaintance. On the contrary, he was partial to"
1472,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"Hugenot's society. The world asked, wonderingly, what capacities had the"
1473,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"latter? Was he not obtuse, sounding, shallow? Mr. Plade alone, of all"
1474,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"the Americans in Paris, asserted from the first that Hugenot was"
1475,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"far-sighted, close, capable. Indeed, he was so earnest in this"
1476,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,enunciation that few thought him disinterested.

1479,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1480,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"It was Master Simp who heard a bold step on the stairs that night, and a"
1481,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,resolute knock upon his own door.
1482,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1483,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""Arrest for debt!"" cried Mr. Simp, falling tearfully upon his bed; ""I"
1484,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"have expected the summons all day."""
1485,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1486,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""The next man may come upon that errand,"" answered the ringing voice of"
1487,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"Andy Plade. ""Freckle sleeps in Clichy to-night; Risque cannot be found;"
1488,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"the rest are as badly off; I have news for you."""
1489,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1490,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""I am the man to be mocked,"" pleaded Simp; ""but you must laugh at your"
1491,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"own joke; I am too wretched to help you."""
1492,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1493,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""The Yankees have opened the Mississippi River; Louisiana is subjugated,"
1494,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,and communication re-established with your neighborhood; you can go
1495,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"home."""
1496,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1497,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""What fraction of the way will this carry me?"" said the other, holding"
1498,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"up a five-franc piece. ""My home is farther than the stars from me."""
1499,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1500,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""It is a little sum,"" urged Mr. Plade; ""one hundred dollars should pay"
1501,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"the whole passage."""
1502,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1503,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"Mr. Simp, in response, mimicked a man shovelling gold pieces, but was"
1504,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"too weak to prolong the pleasantry, and sat down on his empty trunk and"
1505,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"wept, as Plade thought, like a calf."
1506,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1507,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""Your case seems indeed hopeless,"" said the elder. ""Suppose I should"
1508,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"borrow five hundred dollars on your credit, would you give me two"
1509,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"hundred for my trouble?"""
1510,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1511,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"Mr. Simp said, bitterly, that he would give four hundred and ninety-five"
1512,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,dollars for five; but Plade pressed for a direct answer to his original
1513,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"proffer, and Simp cried ""Yes,"" with an oath."
1514,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1515,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""Then listen to me! there is no reason to doubt that your neighbors have"
1516,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"made full crops for two years--cotton, sugar, tobacco. All this remains"
1517,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,at home unsold and unshipped--yours with the rest. Take the oath of
1518,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,allegiance to the Yankee Government before its _chargé des affaires_ in
1519,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"Paris. That will save your crops from confiscation, and be your passport"
1520,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"to return. Then write to your former banker here, promising to consign"
1521,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"your cotton to him, if he will advance five hundred dollars to take you"
1522,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,to Louisiana. He knows you received of old ten thousand dollars per
1523,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,annum. He will risk so small a sum for a thing so plausible and
1524,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"profitable."""
1525,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1526,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""I don't know what you have been saying,"" muttered Simp. ""I cannot"
1527,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,comprehend a scheme so intricate; you bewilder me! What is a
1528,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"consignment? How am I, bigad! to make that clear in a letter? Perhaps my"
1529,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,speech in the case of Rutledge _vs._ Pinckney might come in well at this
1530,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"juncture."""
1531,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1532,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""Write!"" cried Plade, contemptuously; ""write at my dictation."""

1534,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,That night the letter was mailed; Mr. Simp was summoned to his banker's
1535,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"the following noon, and at dusk he met Andy Plade in the Place Vendôme,"
1536,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,and paid over a thousand francs with a sigh.
1537,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1538,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"On the third night succeeding, Messrs. Plade and Hugenot were smoking"
1539,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"their cigars at Nice, and Mr. Simp, without the least idea of what he"

1560,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""I say marry me!"" repeated the madame, stamping her foot. ""You are rich"
1561,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,in America. You have slaves and land and houses and fine relatives. You
1562,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,will get all these when the war closes; but if you die of starvation in
1563,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"Paris, they amount to nothing. Marry me! I will keep you alive here; you"
1564,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"will give me half of your possessions there! I shall be a grand lady,"
1565,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"ride in my carriage, and have a nasty black woman to wash my fine"
1566,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"clothes."""
1567,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1568,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""That is impossible, Francine,"" answered Pisgah, not so utterly degraded"
1569,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,but he felt the stigma of such a proposition from his
1570,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,_blanchisseuse_--and as he leaned his faded hairs upon his unnerved and
1571,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"quivering hands, the old pride fluttered in his heart a moment and"
1572,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,painted rage upon his neck and temples.
1573,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1574,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""You are insulted, my lord count!"" cried Madame Francine; ""an alliance"
1575,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"with a poor washerwoman would shame your great kin. Pay me my money, you"
1576,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"beggar! or I shall put the fine gentleman in prison for debt."""
1577,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1578,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""That would be a kindness to me, madame,"" said Pisgah, very humbly and"
1579,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,piteously.
1580,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1581,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""You are right,"" she made answer, with a mocking laugh; ""I will not save"
1582,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"your life: you shall starve, sir! you shall starve!"""
1583,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1584,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"In truth, this consummation seemed very close, for as Pisgah entered his"
1585,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"creamery soon afterward, the proprietor met him at the threshold."
1586,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1587,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""Monsieur Pisgah,"" he said, ""you can have nothing to eat here, until you"
1588,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"pay a part of your bill with me; I am a poor man, sir, and have"
1589,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"children."""
1590,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1591,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"Pisgah kept up the street with heavy forebodings, and turned into the"
1592,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"place of a clothes-merchant, to whom his face had long been familiar."
1593,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"When he emerged, his handsome habits, the gift of Madame Francine, hung"
1594,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"in the clothes-dealer's window, and Mr. Pisgah, wearing a common blouse,"
1595,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"a cap, and coarse hide shoes, repaired to the nearest wine-shop, and"
1596,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,drank a dead man's portion of absinthe at the zinc counter. Then he
1597,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"returned to his own hotel, but as he reached to the rack for his key,"
1598,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,the landlady laid her hand upon it and shook her head.
1599,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1600,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""You are properly dressed, Monsieur Pisgah,"" she said; ""those who have"
1601,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"no money should work; you cannot sleep in twenty-six to night, sir; I"
1602,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"have shut up the chamber, and seized the little rubbish which you left."""
1603,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1604,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"Pisgah was homeless--a vagabond, an outcast. He walked unsteadily along"
1605,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"the street in the pleasant evening, and the film of tears that shut the"
1606,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,world from his eyes was peopled with far-off and familiar scenes.
1607,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1608,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"He saw his father's wide acres, with the sunset gilding the fleeces of"
1609,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,his sheep and crowning with fire the stacks of grain and the vanes upon
1610,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"his granges. Then the twilight fell, and the slaves went homeward"
1611,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"singing, while the logs on the brass andirons lit up the windows of the"
1612,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"mansion, and every negro cabin was luminous, so that in the night the"
1613,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"homestead looked like a village. Then the moon rose above the woods,"
1614,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"making the lawn frosty, and shining upon the long porch, where his"
1615,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"mother came out to welcome him, attended by the two house-dogs, which"
1616,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"barked so loudly in their glee that all the hen-coops were alarmed, and"
1617,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,the peacocks in the trees held their tails to the stars and trilled.
1618,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1619,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""Come in, my son,"" said the mother, looking proudly upon the tall,"
1620,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"straight shape and glossy locks; ""the supper is smoking upon the table;"
1621,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"here is your familiar julep, without which you have no appetite; the"
1622,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"Maryland biscuit are unusually good this evening, and there is the"
1623,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"yellow pone in the corner, with Sukey, your old nurse, behind it. Do you"
1624,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"like much cream in your coffee, as you used to? Bless me! the partridge"
1625,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"is plump as a duck; but here is your napkin, embroidered with your name;"
1626,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"let us ask a blessing before we eat!"""
1627,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1628,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"While all this is going on, the cat, which has been purring by the fire,"
1629,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"takes a wicked notion to frighten the canary bird, but the high old"
1630,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"clock in the corner, imported from England before the celebrated"
1631,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"Revolutionary war, impresses the cat as a very formidable object with"
1632,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"its stately stride-stride-stride--so that the cat regarding it a moment,"
1633,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"forgets the canary bird, and mews for a small portion of cream in a"
1634,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,saucer.
1635,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1636,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""Halloo! halloo!"" says the parrot, awakened by a leap of the fire; for,"
1637,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"the back-log has broken in half, and Pisgah sees, by the increased"
1638,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"light, the very hair-powder gleam on the portrait of General Washington."
1639,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"But now the cloth is removed, and the old-fashioned table folds up its"
1640,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"leaves; they sip some remarkable sherry, which grandfather regards with"
1641,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"a wheezy sort of laugh, and after they have played one game of draughts,"
1642,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"Mr. Pisgah looks at his gold chronometer, and asks if he has still the"
1643,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,great room above the porch and plenty of bedclothes.
1644,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1645,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"This is what Mr. Pisgah sees upon the film of his tears--wealth,"
1646,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"happiness, manliness! When he dashes the tears themselves to the"
1647,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"pavement with an oath, what rises upon his eye and his heart?"
1648,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"Paris--grand, luxurious, pitiless, and he, at twilight, flung upon the"
1649,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"world, with neither kindred nor country--a thing unwilling to live,"
1650,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,unfit to die!
1651,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1652,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,He strolled along the quay to the Morgue; the beautiful water of St.
1653,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"Michel fell sibilantly cold from the fountain, and Apollyon above, at"
1654,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"the feet of the avenging angel, seemed a sermon and an allegory of his"
1655,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,own prostration. How all the folks upon the bridge were stony faced! It
1656,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,had never before occurred to him that men were cold-blooded creatures.
1657,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"He wondered if the Seine, dashing against the quays and piers beneath,"
1658,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,were not their proper element? Ay! for here were three drowned people on
1659,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"the icy slabs of the Morgue, with half a hundred gazing wistfully at"
1660,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"them, and their fixed eyes glaring fishily at the skylight, as if it"
1661,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,were the surface of the river and they were at rest below.
1662,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1663,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,So seemed all the landscape as he kept down the quay--the lines of high
1664,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"houses were ridges only in the sea, and Notre Dame, lifting its towers"
1665,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"and sculptured façade before, was merely a high-decked ship, with"
1666,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,sailors crowding astern. The holy apostles above the portal were more
1667,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"like human men than ever, with their silicious eyes and pulseless"
1668,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,bosoms; while the hideous gargoyles at the base of each crocheted
1669,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"pinnacle, seemed swimming in the dusky evening."
1670,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1671,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,It may have been that this aqueous phenomenon was natural to one
1672,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""half-seas over;"" but not till he stood on the place of the Hôtel de la"
1673,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"Ville, did Pisgah have any consciousness whatever that he walked upon"
1674,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,the solid world.
1675,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1676,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"At this moment he was reminded, also, that he held a letter in his hand,"
1677,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"his landlady's gift at parting; it was dated, ""Clichy dungeon,"" and"
1678,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,signed by Mr. Freckle.
1679,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1680,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""Dear Pisgah,"" read the text, ""I am here at claim of restaurateur;"
1681,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"shall die to-morrow at or before twelve o'clock, if Andy Plade"
1682,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,don't fork over my subscription of two hundred francs. Andy Plade
1683,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"damned knave--no mistake! No living soul been to see me, except"
1684,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,letter from Hon. Mr. Slidell. He has got sixteen thousand dollars
1685,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"in specie for Simp. Where's Simp, dogorn him! Hon. S. sent to"
1686,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,Simp's house; understood he'd sailed for America. Requested Hon. S.
1687,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,to give me small part of money as Simp's next friend. Hon. S.
1688,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,declined. Population of prison very great. Damned scrub stock!
1689,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,Don't object to imprisonment as much as the fleas. Fleas bent on
1690,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,aiding my escape. If they crawl with me to-morrow night as far
1691,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"again as last night I'll be clear--no mistake! Live on soup,"
1692,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"chiefly. Abhor soup. Had forty francs here first day, but debtor"
1693,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,with one boot and spectacles won it at _picquet_. Restaurateur says
1694,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,bound to keep me here a thousand years if I don't sock--shall
1695,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"die--no mistake! Come see me, _toute suite_. Fetch pocket-comb,"
1696,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"soap, and English Bible."
1697,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1698,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""Yours, in deep waters,                              FRECKLE."""
1699,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1700,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""The whole world is in deep waters,"" said Pisgah, dismally. ""So much the"
1701,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"better for them; here goes for something stronger!"""
1702,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1703,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"He repaired to the nearest drinking-saloon, and demanded a glass brimful"
1704,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"of absinthe, at which all the garçons and patrons held up their hands"
1705,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,while he drank it to the dregs.
1706,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1707,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""Sacristie!"" cried a man with mouth wide open, ""that gentleman can drink"
1708,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"clear laudanum."""
1709,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1710,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""I wish,"" thought Pisgah, with a pale face, ""that it had been laudanum;"
1711,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,I should have been dead by this time and all over. Why don't I get the
1712,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"_delirium tremens_? I should like to be crazy. Oh, ho, ho, ho!"" he"
1713,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"continued, laughing wildly, ""to be in a hospital--nurses, soft bed, good"
1714,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"food, pity--oh, ho! that would be a fate fit for an emperor."""
1715,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1716,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"Here his eye caught something across the way which riveted it, and he"
1717,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"took half a step forward, exultingly. A great _caserne_, or barrack,"
1718,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"adjoined the Hôtel de Ville, and twice every day, after breakfast and"
1719,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"dinner, the soldiers within distributed the surplus of their rations to"
1720,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,mendicants without. The latter were already assembling--laborers in
1721,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"neat, common clothing, with idlers and profligates not more forbidding,"
1722,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,while a soldier on guard directed them where to rest and in what order
1723,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,or number to enter the building. Pisgah halted a moment with his heart
1724,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"in his throat. But he was very hungry, and his silver was half gone"
1725,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"already; if he purchased a dinner, he might not be left with sufficient"
1726,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,to obtain a bed for the night.
1727,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1728,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""Great God!"" he said aloud, lifting his clenched hands and swollen eyes"
1729,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"to the stars, ""am I, then, among the very dogs, that I should beg the"
1730,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"crumbs of a common soldier?"""
1731,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1732,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"He took his place in the line, and when at length his turn was"
1733,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"announced, followed the rabble shamefacedly. The _chasseurs_ in the"
1734,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"mess-room were making merry after dinner with pipes and cards, and one"
1735,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"of these, giving Pisgah a piece of bread and a tin basin of strong"
1736,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"soup, slapped him smartly upon the shoulder, and cried:"
1737,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1738,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""My fine fellow! you have the stuff in you for a soldier."""
1739,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1740,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""I am just getting a soldier's stuff into me,"" responded Pisgah,"
1741,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,antithetically.
1742,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1743,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""Why do you go abroad, hungry, ill-dressed, and houseless, when you can"
1744,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"wear the livery of France?"""
1745,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1746,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,Pisgah thought the soldier a very presuming person.
1747,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1748,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""I am a foreigner,"" he said, ""a--a--a French Canadian (we speak"
1749,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,_patois_ there). My troubles are temporary merely. A day or two may make
1750,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"me rich."""
1751,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1752,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""Yet for that day or two,"" continued the _chasseur_, ""you will have the"
1753,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,humiliation of begging your bread. What signifies seven years of
1754,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,honorable service to three days of mendicancy and distress? We are well
1755,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,cared for by the nation; we are respected over the world. It is a mean
1756,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,thing to be a soldier in other lands; here we are the gentlemen of
1757,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"France."""
1758,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1759,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"Pisgah had never looked upon it in that light, and said so."
1760,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1761,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""Your poverty may have unmanned you,"" repeated the other; ""to recover"
1762,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,your own esteem do a manly act! We have all feared death as citizens;
1763,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"but take cold steel in your hand, and you can look into your grave"
1764,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"without a qualm. I say to you,"" spoke the _chasseur_, clearly and"
1765,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"eloquently, ""be one of us. Decide now, before a doubt mars your better"
1766,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"resolve! You are a young man, though the soulless career of a citizen"
1767,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,has anticipated the whitening of your hairs. Plant your foot; throw back
1768,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"your shoulders; say 'yes!'"""
1769,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1770,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""I do!"" cried Pisgah, with something of the other's enthusiasm; ""I was"
1771,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"born a gentleman, I will die a gentleman, or a soldier."""
1772,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1773,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"They put Mr. Pisgah among the conscripts recently levied, and he went"
1774,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"about town with a fictitious number in his hat, joining in their"
1775,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,bacchanal choruses. The next day he appeared in white duck jacket and
1776,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"pantaloons, looking like an overgrown baker's boy, with a chapeau like a"
1777,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"flat, burnt loaf. He was then put through the manual, which seemed to"
1778,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"indicate all possible motions save that of liquoring up, and when he was"
1779,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"so fatigued that he had not the energy even to fall down, he was clasped"
1780,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"in the arms of Madame Francine, who had traced him to the barracks, but"
1781,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,was too late to avert his destiny.
1782,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1783,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""Oh! _mon amant!_"" she cried, falling upon his neck. ""Why did you go and"
1784,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"do it? You knew that I did not mean to see you starve."""
1785,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1786,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""You have consigned me to a soldier's grave, woman!"" answered Pisgah, in"
1787,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,the deepest tragedy tone.
1788,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1789,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""Do not say so, my _bonbon_!"" pleaded the good lady, covering him with"
1790,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"kisses. ""I would have worn my hands to the bone to save you from this"
1791,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"dreadful life. Suppose you should be sent to Algiers or Mexico, or some"
1792,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"other heathen country, and die there."""
1793,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1794,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,It was Pisgah's turn to be touched.
1795,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1796,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""My blood is upon your head, Francine! Have you any money?"""
1797,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1798,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""Yes, yes! a gentleman, a _noir_, a _naigre_, for whom I have washed,"
1799,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"paid me fifty francs this evening. It is all here; take it, my love!"""
1800,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1801,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""I do not know, creature! that your conduct permits me to do so,"" said"
1802,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"Pisgah, drawing back."
1803,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1804,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""You will drive me mad if you refuse,"" shrieked the blanchisseuse. ""Oh!"
1805,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"oh! how wicked and wretched am I!"""
1806,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1807,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"""Enough, madame! step over the way for my habitual glass of absinthe. Be"
1808,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,particular about the change. We military men must be careful of our
1809,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"incomes. Stay! you may embrace me if you like."""
1810,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1811,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"The poor woman came every day to the barracks, bringing some trifle of"
1812,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"food or clothing. She washed his regimentals, burnished his buckles and"
1813,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"boots, paid his losses at cards, and bought him books and tobacco. She"
1814,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"could never persuade herself that Pisgah was not her victim, and he"
1815,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,found it useful to humor the notion.
1816,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,
1817,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"Down in the swift Seine, at her booth in the great lavatory, where the"
1818,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"ice rushed by and the rain beat in, she thought of Pisgah as she toiled;"
1819,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"and though her back ached and her hands were flayed, she never wondered"
1820,THE COLONY DISBANDED.,"if her lot were not the most pitiable, and his in part deserved."

1840,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"before; one other diligence, packed full, with the horses' heads turned"
1841,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"northward, and the blue-nosed Swiss clerk calling out the names of"
1842,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,passengers; a half-dozen cabriolets looking at each other irresolutely
1843,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"and facing all possible ways; two score of unwashed loungers, in red"
1844,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"neck-kerchiefs and velvet jackets, smoking rank, rakish, black cigars;"
1845,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,several streets of equal crookedness and filthiness abutting against a
1846,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"grimy church, whence beggars, old women, and priests emerge continually;"
1847,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"and far above all, as if suspended in the air, a grim, battlemented"
1848,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"castle, a defence, as it seems, against the snowy mountains which march"
1849,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,upon Bellinzona from every side to crush its orchards and vineyards and

1865,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
1866,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"The guard, however, was in advance, a tall person, wrapped to the eyes"

1869,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
1870,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"He flourished his whip like a fencing-master, moved in a cloud of"

1877,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"The other had already given double the sum, and it was odd, now that one"

1880,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"""God bless me, Andy!"" cries the little person, stopping short; ""you have"

1886,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
1887,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"The paleness faded out of his cheeks as he drank deeply of the spirits,"
1888,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"but the jaws were set hard, and the eyes looked stony and pitiless. The"
1889,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,man was ailing beyond all doubt.
1890,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
1891,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,The whip cracked in front; the great diligence started with a groan and
1892,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,a crackling of joints; the little postilion set the cabriolet going with
1893,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,a chirp and a whistle; the priests and idlers looked up excitedly; the
1894,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"women rushed to the windows to flutter their handkerchiefs, and all the"
1895,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"beggars gave sturdy chase, dropping benedictions and damnations as they"
1896,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,went.
1897,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
1898,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,The small person placed his boots upon the empty cushion before and
1899,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,regarded them with some benevolence; then he touched his mustache with a
1900,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"comb, which he took from the head of his cane."

1902,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"""It is surprising, Andy,"" he said, ""how the growth of one's feet bears"

1914,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"""It has been a cheap trip!"" exclaimed the diminutive person, changing"

1926,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
1927,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,One eye only of the large gentleman was visible through the folds of his

1929,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"It was only an eye, but it seemed to be a whole face, an entire man. It"
1930,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"was full of thoughts, of hopes, of acts! Had the little person marked"

1933,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
1934,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"He folded up the wallet, however, and slipped it into his inside-pocket,"

1981,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
1982,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,His co-voyageur was without curiosity; the former pallidness and
1983,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"silentness resumed their dominion over him, and the lesser gentleman"
1984,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,settled moodily back to his newspaper.
1985,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
1986,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,No word was interchanged for several hours. They passed through shaggy
1987,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"glens, under toppled towers and battlements, by squalid villages, and"
1988,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"within the sound of dashing streams. If they descended ever, it was to"
1989,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,gain breath for a longer ascent; for now the mountain snows were above
1990,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"them on either side, and the Alps rose sublimely impassable in front."
1991,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,The hawks careened beneath them; the chamois above dared not look down
1992,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"for dizziness, and Hugenot said, at Ariola, that they were taking lunch"
1993,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,in a balloon. The manner of Mr. Plade now altered marvellously. It might
1994,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,have been his breakfast that gave him spirit and speech; he sang a
1995,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"merry, bad song, which the rocks echoed back, and all the goitred women"
1996,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,at the roadside stopped with their pack burdens to listen. He told a
1997,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"thousand anecdotes. He knew all the story of the pass; how the Swiss,"
1998,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"filing through it, had scattered the Milanese; how Suwarrow and Massena"
1999,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,had made its sterility fertile with blood.
2000,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
2001,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,Hugenot's admiration amounted to envy. He had never known his associate
2002,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"so brilliant, so pleasing; the exaltation was too great, indeed, to"
2003,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,arise from any ordinary cause; but Hugenot was not shrewd enough to
2004,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,inquire into the affair. He wearied at length of the talk and of the
2005,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"scene, and when at last they reached the region of perpetual ice, he"
2006,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"closed the cabriolet windows, and watched the filtering flakes, and"
2007,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"heard the snow crush under the wheels, and dropped into a deep sleep"
2008,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,which the other seemed to share.
2009,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
2010,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"The clouds around them made the mountains dusky, and the interior of the"
2011,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,carriage was quite gloomy. At length the large gentleman turned his
2012,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"head, so that his ear could catch every breath, and he regarded the dim"
2013,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,outlines of the lesser with motionless interest. Then he took a straw
2014,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"from the litter at his feet, and, bending forward, touched his comrade's"
2015,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"throat. The other snored measuredly for a while, but the titillation"
2016,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"startled him at length, and he beat the air in his slumber. When the"
2017,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"irritation ceased he breathed tranquilly again, and then the first-named"
2018,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,placed his hand softly into the sleeper's pocket. He drew forth the
2019,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"wallet with steady fingers, and as coolly emptied it of its contents."
2020,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"These he concealed in the leg of his boot, but replaced the book where"
2021,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"he had found it. For a little space he remained at rest, leaning against"
2022,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"the back of the carriage, with his head bent upon his breast and his"
2023,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,hands clenched like one at bay and in doubt.
2024,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
2025,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,The slow advance of the teams and the frequent changes of
2026,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,direction--sometimes so abrupt as almost to reverse the
2027,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,cabriolet--advised him that they were climbing the mountain by zigzags
2028,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"or terraces. He knew that they were in the _Val Tremola_, or Trembling"
2029,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"Way, and he shook his comrade almost fiercely, as if relieved by some"
2030,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,idea which the place suggested.
2031,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
2032,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"""Hugenot,"" he said, ""rouse up! The grandeur of the Alps is round about"
2033,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,us; you must not miss this scene. Come with me! Quit the vehicle! I know
2034,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"the place, and will exhibit it."""
2035,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
2036,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"The other, accustomed to obey, leaped to the ground immediately, and"
2037,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"followed through the snow, ankle deep, till they passed the diligence,"
2038,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,which kept in advance. The guard could not be seen--he might have
2039,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,resorted to the interior; and the two pedestrians at once left the
2040,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"roadway, climbing its elbows by a path more or less distinctly marked,"
2041,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,so that after a half hour they were perhaps a mile ahead. The agility of
2042,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,Mr. Plade during this episode was the marvel of his companion. He scaled
2043,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"the rocks like a goatherd, and his foot-tracks in the snow were long,"
2044,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,like the route of a giant. The ice could not betray the sureness of his
2045,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"stride; the rare, thin atmosphere was no match for his broad, deep"
2046,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"chest. He shouted as he went, and tossed great boulders down the"
2047,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"mountain, and urged on his flagging comrade by cheer and taunt and"
2048,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,invective. No madman set loose from captivity could be guilty of so
2049,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"extravagant, exaggerated elation."
2050,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
2051,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,At last they stood upon a little bridge spanning a chasm like a cobweb.
2052,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,A low parapet divided it from the awful gulf. On the other side the
2053,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"mountain lifted its jagged face, clammy with icicles, and far over all"
2054,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"towered the sterile peaks, above the reach of clouds or lightnings,"
2055,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,forever in the sunshine--forever desolate.
2056,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
2057,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"""Stand fast!"" said the leader, suddenly cold and calm. ""Uncover, that"
2058,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,the snow-flakes may give us the baptism of nature! There is no human God
2059,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,at this vast height; they worship _Him_ in the flat world below. Give me
2060,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,your hand and look down! You are not dizzy? One should be free from the
2061,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"baseness of fear, standing here upon St. Gothard."""
2062,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
2063,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"""If I had no qualm before,"" said Hugenot, ""your words would make me"

2066,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"""You have heard of the 'valley of the shadow'? Was your ideal like this?"

2069,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"conjure up. That is the Tessino, braining itself in cataracts. Yonder,"
2070,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"where the clouds make a golden lake, laving forests of firs, lies Italy"
2071,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"as the Goths first beheld it, with their spears quivering. See how the"

2073,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"standards should be rent."""
2074,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
2075,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"The other, half in charm, half in awe, listened like one spell-bound,"
2076,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,with his fingers tingling and his eyeballs throbbing.
2077,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
2078,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"""This silence,"" said the elder, ""is more freezing to me than the"
2079,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,bitterness of the cold. The very snow-flakes are dumb; nothing makes
2080,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,discord but the avalanche; it is always twilight; men lie down in the
2081,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"snows to die, but they are numb and cannot cry."""
2082,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
2083,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"""Be still,"" replied the other, ""your talk is strangely out of place. I"

2085,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
2086,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"""You are not wrong,"" cried the greater, raising his voice till it became"
2087,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"shrill and terrible; ""your last moments are passing; that yawning ravine"
2088,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"is your grave. I told you an hour ago how one bad, dark deed would"
2089,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"redeem me. It is done! I have robbed you, and your death is essential to"
2090,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"my safety."""
2091,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
2092,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"Hugenot sank upon the snow of the parapet, speechless and almost"
2093,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"lifeless. He clasped his hands, but could not raise his head; the whole"
2094,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"scene faded from his eye. If he had been weak before, he was impotent"
2095,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,now.
2096,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
2097,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"The strong man held him aloft by the shoulders with an iron grasp, and"
2098,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,his cold eye gave evidence to the horrible validity of his words.
2099,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
2100,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"""I do not lie or play, Hugenot,"" he said, in the same clear voice; ""I"
2101,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,have premeditated this deed for many weeks. You are doomed! Only a
2102,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,miracle can help you. The dangers of the pass will be my exculpation; it
2103,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,will be surmised that you fell into the ravine. There will be no marks
2104,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,of violence upon you but those of the sharp stones. We have been close

2107,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
2108,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,The victim had recovered sufficiently to catch a part of this
2109,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,confession. His lips framed only one reply--the dying man's last straw:
2110,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
2111,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"""After death!"" he said; ""have you thought of that?"""
2112,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
2113,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"""Ay,"" answered the other, ""long and thoroughly. Phantoms, remorses and"

2115,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
2116,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,It was only a moment's struggle that ensued. The wretch clung to the
2117,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"parapet, and called on God and mercy. He was lifted on high in the"
2118,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"strong arms, and whirled across the barrier. The other looked grimly at"
2119,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,the falling burden. He wondered if a dog or a goat would have been so
2120,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,long falling. The distance was profound indeed; but to the murderer's
2121,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,sanguine thought the body hung suspended in the air. It would not sink.
2122,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,The clouds seemed to bear it up for testimony; the cold cliffs held
2123,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,aloft their heads for justice; the snow-flakes fell like the ballots of
2124,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"jurymen, voting for revenge--all nature seemed roused to animation by"
2125,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"this one act. An icicle dropped with a keen ring like a knife, and the"
2126,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,stream below pealed a shrill alarum.
2127,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
2128,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"He had done the bad, dark deed. Was he more resolute or courageous now"

2130,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,
2131,THE MURDER ON THE ALPS.,"The body disappeared at length, carried downward by the torrent; but a"

2151,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,"from the wind and the snow; and there, wrapped in his buff garments,"
2152,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,"whose hue, assimilating to that of the rock, absorbed him from"

2155,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,
2156,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,For an instant only the accused shrank back. Then his body grew short

2158,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,
2159,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,"""Hold off!"" said Risque, in his old, hard, measured way; ""we guards go"

2162,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,
2163,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,The cold face was never more emotionless; he held a revolver in his

2167,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,"""You do not play well,"" said Risque at length, when the other, ghastly"

2184,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,
2185,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,"Plade did not dally, but took to flight at once. He climbed by the"
2186,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,"angles of the terraces, and saw the diligence far below tugging up the"

2188,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,"besides, but yet there were other footfalls in the snow, other sounds,"
2189,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,as of a man breathing hard and pursued upon the lonely mountain. The
2190,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,"fugitive turned--once, twice, thrice; he laughed aloud, and shook his"
2191,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,"clenched hand at the sky. Still the flat, dead tramp followed close"
2192,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,"behind, and the pace seemed not unfamiliar. It could not be--his blood"
2193,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,"ceased to circulate, and stood freezing at the thought--was it the"
2194,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,"march, the tread of Hugenot?"
2195,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,
2196,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,"He dropped a loud curse, like a howl, and kept upon his way. The"

2198,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,"of a small, lithe, human foot, made by no living man. He shut his eyes"
2199,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,"and his ears, but the consciousness remained, the inexplicable"
2200,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,phenomenon of some invisible but familiar thing which would not leave
2201,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,him; which made its register as it passed; which no speed could

2204,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,"Was it a sick fancy, a probed heart, or did the phantom of the dead man"

2230,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,"there was an involuntary cheer, and as he galloped away the great"

2232,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,
2233,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,The telegraph kept above him--a single line; he knew the tardiness of
2234,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,"foot when pursued by the lightning. In one place, the conductor,"
2235,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,"wrenched from the insulators, dropped almost to the ground. There was a"

2237,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,"making a knot about the wire, dashed off at a bound; the iron snapped"
2238,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,"behind; his triumphant laugh pealed yet on the twilight, when the cries"

2241,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,
2242,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,The night closed over the road as he caught the wizard bells. The

2244,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,burdens of snow. There were cries of wild beasts from the ravines below.
2245,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,The post-houses were red with firelight. The steed floundered through
2246,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,the snow-drifts driven by blow and halloo. It was a fearful ride upon
2247,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,the high Alps; the sublimity of nature bowed down to the mystery of

2250,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,"Bright noon, on the third day succeeding, saw the fugitive emerge from"

2260,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,The Planter had been delayed; she waited with steam up and an expectant

2293,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,"stopped before an ancient church, grotesque with broken buttresses,"

2319,THE ONE GOOD DEED OF A PRIVATEERSMAN.,"speech, and the old house appeared to settle now and then with a groan"

2477,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"The catastrophe of the Colony and the episode having been attained, we"
2478,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"have only to leave Mr. Pisgah in Algiers, whither court-martial"
2479,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"consigned him, with the penalty of hard labor, and Mr. Risque on the"
2480,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,stage route he was so eminently fitted to adorn. The unhappy Freckle
2481,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"continued in the prison of Clichy, and, having nothing else to do,"
2482,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,commenced the novel process of thinking. The prison stood high up on
2483,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"Clichy Hill, walled and barred and guarded, like other jails, but within"
2484,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"it a fair margin of liberty was allowed the bankrupts, just sufficient"
2485,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,to make their fate terrible by temptation. Some good soul had endowed it
2486,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"with a library; newspapers came every day; a café was attached to it,"
2487,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"where spirituous liquors were prohibited, to the wrath of the dry"
2488,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,throats and raging thirsts of the captives; there was a garden behind
2489,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"it, and a billiard saloon, but these luxuries were not gratuitous; poor"
2490,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"Freckle could not even pay his one sou per diem to cook his rations, so"
2491,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,that the Prisoners' Relief Association had to make him a present of it.
2492,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"He spent his time between his bare, cheerless bedroom and the public"
2493,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,hall. There were many Americans in the place; but none of them were
2494,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,friendly with him when he was found to have no cash. Yet he heard them
2495,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,speak together of their countrymen who had lain in the same jail years
2496,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"before. Yonder was the room of Horace Greeley, incarcerated for a debt"
2497,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,which was not his own; here the blood-stains of the Pennsylvania youth
2498,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"who looked out of the window, heedless of warning, and was shot dead by"
2499,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"the guard; there the ancient chair, in which Hallidore, the Creole, sat"
2500,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"so often, possessor of a million francs, but too obstinate to pay his"
2501,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"tailor's bill and go free. While Freckle thought of these, it was"
2502,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,suggested to him that he was a very wicked man. The tuitions of his
2503,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"patriarchal father came to mind; he was seen on his knees, to the"
2504,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"infinite amusement of the other debtors, who were, however, quite too"
2505,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"polite to laugh in his face, and he no longer staked his ration of wine"
2506,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"at cards, whereby he had commonly lost it, but held long conversations"
2507,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,with an ardent old priest who visited the jail. The priest gave Freckle
2508,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"_breviaries_ and catechisms, and told him that there was no peace of"
2509,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,mind outside of the apostolic fold.
2510,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,
2511,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"So Freckle diligently embraced the ancient Romish faith, renounced the"
2512,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"tenets of his plain old sire as false and heretical, and earnestly"
2513,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,prepared himself to enter the priesthood.
2514,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,
2515,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"In this frame of mind he was found by Mr. Simp, who had unexpectedly"
2516,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"returned to Paris, and, finding himself again prosperous, came to"
2517,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,release Freckle from the toils of Clichy.
2518,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,
2519,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"The latter waved him away. ""I wish to know none of you,"" he said. ""I"
2520,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"shall serve out this term, and never again speak to an American abroad."""
2521,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,
2522,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"He was firm, and achieved his purpose. Enthusiasm often answers for"
2523,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"brains, and Freckle's religious zeal made him a changed man. He entered"
2524,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"a Jesuits' school after his discharge, and in another fashion became as"
2525,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"stern, severe, and self-denying as had been his father. He sometimes saw"
2526,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"his old comrade, Simp, driving down the Champs Elysées as Freckle came"
2527,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"from church in Paris, but the gallant did not recognize the young priest"
2528,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"in his dark gown and hose, and wide-rimmed hat."
2529,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,
2530,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"They followed their several directions, and in the end, with the"
2531,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"lessening fortunes of the Confederacy, grew more moody, and yet more"
2532,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,ruined by the consciousness that after once suffering the agony of
2533,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"expatriation, they had not improved the added chance to make of"
2534,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"themselves men, not Colonists."
2535,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,
2536,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"It is not the pleasantest phase of our human nature to depict, but since"
2537,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,"we have essayed it, let it close with its own surrounding shadow."
2538,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,
2539,THE SURVIVING COLONISTS.,If we have given no light touch of womanhood to relieve its sombre

2646,TEMPTATION.,"To say that Ralph Flare was ""lonesome"" would convey a feeble idea of his"

2674,TEMPTATION.,
2675,TEMPTATION.,"A tall, sallow, bright-eyed Frenchman was seated at a fragment of"
2676,TEMPTATION.,"counter within the smallest apartment in the world, and addressing this"
2677,TEMPTATION.,"man as ""Père George"" the stranger passed through a second sash doorway"
2678,TEMPTATION.,and introduced Ralph Flare to the most miscellaneous and democratic
2679,TEMPTATION.,assemblage that he had ever beheld in his life.
2680,TEMPTATION.,
2681,TEMPTATION.,"Two long yellow tables reached lengthwise down a long, narrow _salon_,"
2682,TEMPTATION.,"the floor whereof was made of tiles, and the light whereof fizzed and"
2683,TEMPTATION.,flamed from two unruly burners. A door at the farther end opened upon a
2684,TEMPTATION.,"cook-room, and the cook, a scorched and meagre woman, was standing now"
2685,TEMPTATION.,"in the firelight, talking in a high key, as only a Frenchwoman can talk."
2686,TEMPTATION.,
2687,TEMPTATION.,"Then there was Madame George, fat and handsome, and gossipy likewise,"
2688,TEMPTATION.,"with a baby, a boy, and a daughter; and the patrons of the place, twenty"
2689,TEMPTATION.,"or more in number, were eating and laughing and all speaking at the same"
2690,TEMPTATION.,"time, so that Ralph Flare was at first stunned and afterward astonished."
2691,TEMPTATION.,
2692,TEMPTATION.,"His new acquaintance, Terrapin, went gravely around the table, shaking"
2693,TEMPTATION.,"hands with every guest, and Ralph was wedged into the remotest corner,"
2694,TEMPTATION.,"with Terrapin upon his right, and upon his left a creature so naïve and"
2695,TEMPTATION.,"petite that he thought her a girl at first, but immediately corrected"
2696,TEMPTATION.,himself and called her a child.
2697,TEMPTATION.,
2698,TEMPTATION.,"Terrapin addressed her as Suzette, and stated that his friend Ralph was"
2699,TEMPTATION.,a stranger and quite solitary; whereat Suzette turned upon him a pair of
2700,TEMPTATION.,"soft, twinkling eyes, and laughed very much as a peach might do, if it"
2701,TEMPTATION.,were possible for a peach to laugh. He could only say a horrible _bon
2702,TEMPTATION.,"jour_, and make the superfluous intimation that he could not speak"
2703,TEMPTATION.,French; and when Madame George gave him his choice of a dozen
2704,TEMPTATION.,"unpronounceable dishes, he looked so utterly blank and baffled that"
2705,TEMPTATION.,Suzette took the liberty of ordering dinner for him.
2706,TEMPTATION.,
2707,TEMPTATION.,"""You won't get the run of the language, Flare,"" said Terrapin,"
2708,TEMPTATION.,"carelessly, ""until you find a wife. A woman is the best dictionary."""
2709,TEMPTATION.,
2710,TEMPTATION.,"""You mean, I suppose,"" said Flare, ""a wife for a time."""
2711,TEMPTATION.,
2712,TEMPTATION.,"Little Suzette was looking oddly at him as he faced her, and when Ralph"
2713,TEMPTATION.,blushed she turned quietly to her _potage_ and gave him a chance to
2714,TEMPTATION.,remark her.
2715,TEMPTATION.,
2716,TEMPTATION.,"She had dark, smooth hair, closing over a full, pale forehead, and her"
2717,TEMPTATION.,"shapely head was balanced upon a fair, round neck. There was an"
2718,TEMPTATION.,"alertness in her erect ear, and open nostril, and pointed brows which"
2719,TEMPTATION.,indicated keen perception and comprehension; yet even more than this
2720,TEMPTATION.,"generic quickness, without which she could not have been French, the"
2721,TEMPTATION.,gentleness of Suzette was manifest.
2722,TEMPTATION.,
2723,TEMPTATION.,Ralph thought to himself that she must be good. It was the face of a
2724,TEMPTATION.,"sweet sister or a bright daughter, or one of those school-children with"
2725,TEMPTATION.,whom he had played long ago. And withal she was very neat. If any
2726,TEMPTATION.,"commandment was issued especially to the French, it enjoined tidiness;"
2727,TEMPTATION.,but this child was so quietly attired that her cleanliness seemed a
2728,TEMPTATION.,"matter of nature, not of command. Her cheap coral ear-drops and the thin"
2729,TEMPTATION.,band of gold upon her white finger could not have been so fitting had
2730,TEMPTATION.,"they been of diamonds; and her tresses, inclosed in a fillet of beads,"
2731,TEMPTATION.,were tied in a breadth of blue ribbon which made a cunning lover's-knot
2732,TEMPTATION.,"above. A plain collar and wristbands, a bright cotton dress and dark"
2733,TEMPTATION.,"apron, and a delicate slipper below--these were the components of a"
2734,TEMPTATION.,picture which Ralph thought the loveliest and pleasantest and best that
2735,TEMPTATION.,he had ever known.
2736,TEMPTATION.,
2737,TEMPTATION.,In his own sober city of the Middle States he would have been ashamed to
2738,TEMPTATION.,"connect with these innocent features a doubt, a light thought, a desire."
2739,TEMPTATION.,"Yet here in France, where climate, or custom, or man had changed the"
2740,TEMPTATION.,"relations though not the nature of woman, he did but as the world, in"
2741,TEMPTATION.,blending with Suzette's tranquil face a series of ideas which he dared
2742,TEMPTATION.,"not associate with what he had called pure, beautiful, or happy."
2743,TEMPTATION.,
2744,TEMPTATION.,"Now and then they spoke together, unintelligibly of course, but very"
2745,TEMPTATION.,"merrily, and Ralph's appetite was that of the great carnivora; potage,"
2746,TEMPTATION.,"beef, mutton, pullet, vanished like waifs, and then came the salad,"
2747,TEMPTATION.,"which he could not make, so that Suzette helped him again with her"
2748,TEMPTATION.,"sprightly white fingers, contriving so marvellous a dish that Ralph"
2749,TEMPTATION.,"thought her a little magician, and wanted to eat salad till daybreak."
2750,TEMPTATION.,
2751,TEMPTATION.,"""Now for the cards!"" cried Terrapin, when they had finished the _café_"
2752,TEMPTATION.,and the _eau-de-vie_; and as the parties ranged themselves about the
2753,TEMPTATION.,"greater table, Terrapin, who knew everybody, gave their names and"
2754,TEMPTATION.,avocations.
2755,TEMPTATION.,
2756,TEMPTATION.,"""That is Boetia, a journalist on the _Siècle_; you will observe that he"
2757,TEMPTATION.,"smokes his cigars quite down to the stump. The little man beside him,"
2758,TEMPTATION.,"with a blouse, is Haynau, fellow of the College of Beaux"
2759,TEMPTATION.,"Arts--dead-broke, as usual; and his friend, the sallow chap, is Moise,"
2760,TEMPTATION.,"whose father died last week, leaving him ten thousand francs. Moise, you"
2761,TEMPTATION.,"will see, has a wife, Feefine, though I suspect him of bigamy; and the"
2762,TEMPTATION.,"tall girl, with hair like midnight and a hard voice, is at present"
2763,TEMPTATION.,unmarried. Those four fellows and their dames are students of medicine.
2764,TEMPTATION.,"They have one hundred francs a month apiece, and keep house upon it."""
2765,TEMPTATION.,
2766,TEMPTATION.,"""And Suzette,"" said Ralph Flare, impatiently."
2767,TEMPTATION.,
2768,TEMPTATION.,"""Oh, she is a _couturière_, a dressmaker, but just now a clerk at a"
2769,TEMPTATION.,"glover's. She has dwelt sagely, generally speaking. She breakfasts upon"
2770,TEMPTATION.,"five sous; a roll, café, and a bunch of grapes--her dinner costs eighty"
2771,TEMPTATION.,"centimes, and she makes a franc and a half a day, leaving enough to pay"
2772,TEMPTATION.,"her room-rent."""
2773,TEMPTATION.,
2774,TEMPTATION.,"""It is a little sum--seven dollars and a half a month--how is the girl"
2775,TEMPTATION.,"to dress?"""
2776,TEMPTATION.,
2777,TEMPTATION.,"Terrapin shrugged his shoulders, but said nothing."
2778,TEMPTATION.,
2779,TEMPTATION.,"They played ""ramps,"" an uproarious game; and Suzette was impetuous and"
2780,TEMPTATION.,"noisy as the rest, with brightened cheeks and eyes and a clear, silvery"
2781,TEMPTATION.,voice. The stake was a bottle of Bordeaux. Few women play cards
2782,TEMPTATION.,"honestly, and Suzette was the first to go out; but seeing that Ralph"
2783,TEMPTATION.,"floundered and lost continually, she gave him her attention, looking"
2784,TEMPTATION.,"over his hand, and talking for him, and counting with so dexterous"
2785,TEMPTATION.,"deceit that he escaped also, while Terrapin paid for the wine."
2786,TEMPTATION.,
2787,TEMPTATION.,It was not the most reputable amusement in the world; but the hours were
2788,TEMPTATION.,"winged, and midnight came untimely. Suzette tied on a saucy brown flat"
2789,TEMPTATION.,"streaming with ribbons, and bade them good-night, ending with Ralph, in"
2790,TEMPTATION.,"whose palm her little fingers lay pulsing an instant, bringing the blood"
2791,TEMPTATION.,to his hand.
2792,TEMPTATION.,
2793,TEMPTATION.,How mean the _cremery_ and its patrons seemed now that she was gone! The
2794,TEMPTATION.,great clamp at the portal of his hotel sounded very ghostly as he
2795,TEMPTATION.,knocked; the concierge was a hideous old man in gown and nightcap.
2796,TEMPTATION.,
2797,TEMPTATION.,"""_Toujours seul, monsieur_,"" he said, with an ugly grin."
2798,TEMPTATION.,
2799,TEMPTATION.,"""What does that mean, Terrapin?"" said Ralph."
2800,TEMPTATION.,
2801,TEMPTATION.,"""He says that you always come home alone."""
2802,TEMPTATION.,
2803,TEMPTATION.,"""How else should I come?"" said Ralph, dubiously."
2804,TEMPTATION.,
2805,TEMPTATION.,"""How, indeed?"" answered Terrapin."
2806,TEMPTATION.,
2807,TEMPTATION.,"It was without doubt a dim old pile--the Hôtel du Hibou. What murderers,"
2808,TEMPTATION.,"and thieves, and Jacobins might not have ascended the tiles of the grand"
2809,TEMPTATION.,"stairway? There was a cumbrous mantel in his chamber, funereal with"
2810,TEMPTATION.,"griffins, and there were portraits with horribly profound eyes. The sofa"
2811,TEMPTATION.,and the chairs were huge; the deep window-hangings were talking together
2812,TEMPTATION.,"in a rustling, mocking way; while the bed in its black recess seemed so"
2813,TEMPTATION.,"very long and broad and high for one person, that Ralph sat down at the"
2814,TEMPTATION.,"stone table, too lonely or too haunted to sleep."
2815,TEMPTATION.,
2816,TEMPTATION.,"Would not even this old grave be made merry with sunlight, if little"
2817,TEMPTATION.,Suzette were here?
2818,TEMPTATION.,
2819,TEMPTATION.,"He opened the book of familiar French phrases, and began to copy some of"
2820,TEMPTATION.,"them. He worked feverishly, determinedly, for quite a time. Then he read"
2821,TEMPTATION.,"the list he had made, half aloud. It was this:"
2822,TEMPTATION.,
2823,TEMPTATION.,"""Good-morning, my pretty one!"""
2824,TEMPTATION.,
2825,TEMPTATION.,"""Will you walk with me?"""
2826,TEMPTATION.,
2827,TEMPTATION.,"""May I have your company to dinner?"""
2828,TEMPTATION.,
2829,TEMPTATION.,"""What is your name?"""
2830,TEMPTATION.,
2831,TEMPTATION.,"""I dare say you laugh at my pronunciation."""
2832,TEMPTATION.,
2833,TEMPTATION.,"""I am lonely in Paris."""
2834,TEMPTATION.,
2835,TEMPTATION.,"""Are you?"""
2836,TEMPTATION.,
2837,TEMPTATION.,"""You ought to see my chambers."""
2838,TEMPTATION.,
2839,TEMPTATION.,"""Let me buy you a bracelet!"""
2840,TEMPTATION.,
2841,TEMPTATION.,"""I love you!"""
2842,TEMPTATION.,
2843,TEMPTATION.,Ralph's voice stopped suddenly. There were deep echoes in the great
2844,TEMPTATION.,"room, which made him thrill and shudder. How still and terrible were the"
2845,TEMPTATION.,silence and loneliness!
2846,TEMPTATION.,
2847,TEMPTATION.,"A pang, half of guilt, half of fear, went keenly to his heart. It seemed"
2848,TEMPTATION.,"to him that his mother was standing by his shoulder, pointing with her"
2849,TEMPTATION.,"thin, tremulous fingers to the writing beneath him, and saying:"
2850,TEMPTATION.,
2851,TEMPTATION.,"""My boy, what does this mean?"""
2852,TEMPTATION.,
2853,TEMPTATION.,"He held it in the candle-flame, and thought he felt better when it was"
2854,TEMPTATION.,burned; but he could not burn all those thoughts of which the paper was
2855,TEMPTATION.,only a copy.

2865,POSSESSION.,"If the _cremery_ had seemed lonely by gaslight, what must Ralph Flare"
2866,POSSESSION.,"have said of it next morning, as he sat in his old place and watched the"
2867,POSSESSION.,"_ouvriers_ at breakfast? They came in, one by one, with their baton of"
2868,POSSESSION.,"brown bread, and called for two sous' worth of coffee and milk. The men"
2869,POSSESSION.,"wore blouses of blue and white, and jested after the Gallic code with"
2870,POSSESSION.,"the sewing-girls. This bread and coffee, and a pear which they should"
2871,POSSESSION.,"eat at noon, would give them strength to labor till nightfall brought"
2872,POSSESSION.,"its frugal repast. Yet they were happy as crickets, and a great deal"
2873,POSSESSION.,more noisy.
2874,POSSESSION.,
2875,POSSESSION.,"Here is little Suzette, smiling and skipping, and driving her glances"
2876,POSSESSION.,straight into Ralph Flare's heart.
2877,POSSESSION.,
2878,POSSESSION.,"""Good-day, sir,"" she cries, and takes a chair close by him, after the"
2879,POSSESSION.,"manner of a sparrow alighting. She smooths back her pure wristbands,"
2880,POSSESSION.,"disclosing the grace of the arm, and as she laughs in Ralph's face he"
2881,POSSESSION.,knows what she is saying to herself; it is more doubtful that he loves
2882,POSSESSION.,her than that she knows it.
2883,POSSESSION.,
2884,POSSESSION.,"""_Peut-être, monsieur, vous-avez besoin des gants?_"""
2885,POSSESSION.,
2886,POSSESSION.,"She gave him the card of her _boutique_, and laughed like a sunbeam"
2887,POSSESSION.,"playing on a rivulet, and went out singing like the witch that she was."
2888,POSSESSION.,
2889,POSSESSION.,"""I don't want gloves,"" said Ralph Flare; ""I won't go to her shop."""
2890,POSSESSION.,
2891,POSSESSION.,"But he asked Père George the direction, notwithstanding; and though his"
2892,POSSESSION.,"conscience seemed to be blocking up the way--a tangible, visible,"
2893,POSSESSION.,"provoking conscience--he put his feet upon it and shut his lips, and"
2894,POSSESSION.,found the place.
2895,POSSESSION.,
2896,POSSESSION.,Ralph Flare has often remarked since--for he is quite an artist
2897,POSSESSION.,now--that of all scenes in art or nature that _boutique_ was to him the
2898,POSSESSION.,"rarest. He has tried to put it into color--the miniature counter, the"
2899,POSSESSION.,"show-case, the background of boxes, each with a button looking"
2900,POSSESSION.,"mischievously at him, or a glove shaking its forefinger, or a shapely"
2901,POSSESSION.,"pair of hose making him blush, and the daintiest child in the world,"
2902,POSSESSION.,flushing and flirting and gossiping before him; but the sketch recalls
2903,POSSESSION.,"matters which he would forget, his hands lose command, something makes"
2904,POSSESSION.,"his eye very dim, and he lays aside his implements, and takes a long"
2905,POSSESSION.,"walk, and wears a sober face all that day."
2906,POSSESSION.,
2907,POSSESSION.,We may all follow up the sequence of a young man's thoughts in doing a
2908,POSSESSION.,strange wrong for the first time. If Ralph's passions of themselves
2909,POSSESSION.,"could not mislead him, there were not lacking arguments and advisers to"
2910,POSSESSION.,"teach him that this was no offence, or that the usage warranted the sin."
2911,POSSESSION.,"He became acquainted, through Terrapin, with dozens of his countrymen;"
2912,POSSESSION.,the youngest and the oldest and the most estimable had their open
2913,POSSESSION.,"attachments. So far as he could remark, the married and the unmarried"
2914,POSSESSION.,tradesmen's wives in Paris were nearly equal in consideration. How could
2915,POSSESSION.,he become perfect in the language without some such incentive and
2916,POSSESSION.,associate?
2917,POSSESSION.,
2918,POSSESSION.,"His income was not considerable, but they told him that to double his"
2919,POSSESSION.,"expenses was certain economy. He was very lonely, and he loved company."
2920,POSSESSION.,His age was that at which the affections and the instincts alike impel
2921,POSSESSION.,"the man to know more of woman--the processes of her mind, her"
2922,POSSESSION.,"capacities, her emotions, the idiosyncrasies which divided her from his"
2923,POSSESSION.,own sex.
2924,POSSESSION.,
2925,POSSESSION.,"Hitherto he had been chaste, though once when he had confessed it to"
2926,POSSESSION.,"Terrapin, that incredulous person said something about the marines, and"
2927,POSSESSION.,"repeated it as a good joke; he felt, indeed, that he was not entirely"
2928,POSSESSION.,"manly. He had half a doubt that he was worthy to walk with men, else why"
2929,POSSESSION.,"had not his desires, like theirs, been stronger than his virtue; and had"
2930,POSSESSION.,not the very feebleness of desire proved also a feebleness of power?
2931,POSSESSION.,"But, more than all, he had a weakness for Suzette."
2932,POSSESSION.,
2933,POSSESSION.,"There was old Terrapin, with bonnets and dresses in his wardrobe, and a"
2934,POSSESSION.,"sewing-basket on his mantel, and with his own huge boots outside the"
2935,POSSESSION.,"door a pair of tapering gaiters, and in his easy-chair a little being to"
2936,POSSESSION.,sing and chatter and mix his punch and make his cigarettes. Ah! how much
2937,POSSESSION.,more entrancing would be Ralph's chamber with Suzette to garnish it! He
2938,POSSESSION.,"would make a thousand studies of her face; she should be his model, his"
2939,POSSESSION.,"professor, his divinity! What was gross in her he would refine; what"
2940,POSSESSION.,"dark he would make known. They would walk together by the river side,"
2941,POSSESSION.,"into the parks, into the open country. He would know no regrets for the"
2942,POSSESSION.,"friends across the sea. Europe would become beautiful to him, and his"
2943,POSSESSION.,art would find inspiration from so much loveliness. No indissoluble tie
2944,POSSESSION.,"would bind them, to make kindness a duty and love necessity. No social"
2945,POSSESSION.,"tyranny should prescribe where he should visit, and where she should"
2946,POSSESSION.,not. The hues of the picture deepened and brightened as he imagined it.
2947,POSSESSION.,"He was resolved to do this thing, though a phantom should come to his"
2948,POSSESSION.,"bedside every night, and every shadow be his accusation."
2949,POSSESSION.,
2950,POSSESSION.,He committed to memory some phrases of French; Terrapin was his
2951,POSSESSION.,"interpreter, and they went together--those three and a sober"
2952,POSSESSION.,_cocher_--to the Bois de Boulogne. Terrapin stated to Suzette in a
2953,POSSESSION.,shockingly informal way that Ralph loved her and would give her a
2954,POSSESSION.,beautiful chamber and relieve her from the drudgery of the glove-shop.
2955,POSSESSION.,
2956,POSSESSION.,"They were passing down the broad, gravelled drive, with the foliage"
2957,POSSESSION.,"above them edged with moonlight, the mock cataract singing musically"
2958,POSSESSION.,"below, and the _cocher_, half asleep, nodding and slashing his horses."
2959,POSSESSION.,And while Terrapin turned his head and made himself invisible in
2960,POSSESSION.,"cigar-smoke, Ralph folded Suzette to his breast, and kissed her once so"
2961,POSSESSION.,demonstratively that the _cocher_ awoke with a spring and nearly fell
2962,POSSESSION.,"off the box, but was quite too much of a _cocher_ to turn and"
2963,POSSESSION.,investigate the matter.
2964,POSSESSION.,
2965,POSSESSION.,"That was the ceremony, and that night the nuptials. Few young couples"
2966,POSSESSION.,"make a better commencement. She gave him a list of her debts, and he"
2967,POSSESSION.,paid them. They removed from Ralph's dim quarters to a cheap and
2968,POSSESSION.,cheerful chamber upon the new Boulevard. It was on the fifth floor; the
2969,POSSESSION.,"room was just adapted for so little a couple. Superficially observed,"
2970,POSSESSION.,the furniture resolved itself into an enormous clock and a monstrously
2971,POSSESSION.,fine mirror; but after a while you might remark four small chairs and a
2972,POSSESSION.,"great one, a bureau and a wardrobe, a sofa and a canopied bed; and just"
2973,POSSESSION.,"without the two gorgeously curtained windows lay a cunning balcony,"
2974,POSSESSION.,"where they could sit of evenings, with the old ruin of the Hôtel Cluny"
2975,POSSESSION.,"beneath them, the towers of Notre Dame in the middle ground, and at the"
2976,POSSESSION.,horizon the beautifully wooded hill of Père la Chaise.
2977,POSSESSION.,
2978,POSSESSION.,Suzette had tristful eyes when they rested upon this cemetery. Her baby
2979,POSSESSION.,"lay there, without a stone--not without a flower."
2980,POSSESSION.,
2981,POSSESSION.,"""_Pauvre petite Jules!_"" she used to say, nestling close to Ralph, and"
2982,POSSESSION.,"for a little while they would not speak nor move, but the smoke of his"
2983,POSSESSION.,"cigar made a charmed circle around them, and the stars came out above,"
2984,POSSESSION.,and the panorama of the great Boulevard moved on at their feet.
2985,POSSESSION.,
2986,POSSESSION.,"Their first difficulties were financial, of course. Suzette would have"
2987,POSSESSION.,"liked a silken robe, a new bonnet, a paletot, gloves and concomitants"
2988,POSSESSION.,"unlimited. She delighted to walk upon the Boulevard, the Rue Rivoli, and"
2989,POSSESSION.,"into the Palais Royal, looking into the shop-windows and selecting what"
2990,POSSESSION.,she would buy when Ralph's remittances came. Her hospitality when his
2991,POSSESSION.,friends visited him did less honor to her purse than to her heart. She
2992,POSSESSION.,certainly made excellent punches; Terrapin thought her cigarettes
2993,POSSESSION.,"unrivalled; she was fond of cutting a fruit-pie, and was quite a"
2994,POSSESSION.,_connoisseur_ with wines. Ralph did not wonder at her tidiness when the
2995,POSSESSION.,"laundry bills were presented, but doubted that the _coiffeur_ beautified"
2996,POSSESSION.,"her hair; and one day, when a cool gentleman in civil uniform knocked at"
2997,POSSESSION.,"the door, and insisted upon the immediate payment of a bill for fifty"
2998,POSSESSION.,"francs, he lost his temper and said bad words. What could be done?"
2999,POSSESSION.,"Suzette was sobbing; Ralph detested ""scenes;"" he threatened to leave"
3000,POSSESSION.,"the hotel and Paris, and frightened her very much--and paid the money."
3001,POSSESSION.,
3002,POSSESSION.,"""You said, Suzette, that you had rendered a full account of all your"
3003,POSSESSION.,"indebtedness. You told me a lie!"""
3004,POSSESSION.,
3005,POSSESSION.,"""Poor boy,"" she replied, ""this debt was so old that I never expected to"
3006,POSSESSION.,"hear of it."""
3007,POSSESSION.,
3008,POSSESSION.,"""Have you any more--old or otherwise?"""
3009,POSSESSION.,
3010,POSSESSION.,"Suzette said demurely that she did not owe a sou in the world, but was"
3011,POSSESSION.,"able to recall thirty francs in the course of the afternoon, and assured"
3012,POSSESSION.,"him, truly, that this was the last."
3013,POSSESSION.,
3014,POSSESSION.,"Still, she lacked economy. They went to the same _cremery_, but her"
3015,POSSESSION.,meals cost one half more than his. She never objected to a ride in a
3016,POSSESSION.,"_voiture_; she liked to go to the balls, but walked very soberly upon"
3017,POSSESSION.,"his arm, recognizing nobody, and exacting the same behavior from Ralph."
3018,POSSESSION.,"Let him look at an unusually pretty girl, through a shop-window, upon"
3019,POSSESSION.,"his peril! If a letter came for him signed Lizzie, or Annie, or Mary,"
3020,POSSESSION.,"she took the dictionary and tried to interpret it, and in the end called"
3021,POSSESSION.,him a _vilain_ and wept.
3022,POSSESSION.,
3023,POSSESSION.,"Toward the letters signed ""Lizzie"" she conceived a deep antipathy. With"
3024,POSSESSION.,"a woman's instinct she discerned that ""Lizzie"" was more to Ralph than"
3025,POSSESSION.,any other correspondent. A single letter satisfied her of this; and when
3026,POSSESSION.,"he was reading it, for the second time, she snatched it from his hand"
3027,POSSESSION.,and flung it fiercely upon the floor. Ralph's eyes blazed menace and her
3028,POSSESSION.,own cowered.
3029,POSSESSION.,
3030,POSSESSION.,"""Take up that letter, Suzette!"""
3031,POSSESSION.,
3032,POSSESSION.,"""I won't!"""
3033,POSSESSION.,
3034,POSSESSION.,"""Take it up, I say! I command! instantly!"" He had risen to his feet,"
3035,POSSESSION.,"and was the master now. She stooped, with pale jealousy lying whitely in"
3036,POSSESSION.,"her temples, and gave it to him meekly, and sat down very stricken and"
3037,POSSESSION.,desolate. There was one whom he loved better than her--she felt it
3038,POSSESSION.,"bitterly--a love more respectful, more profound--a woman, perhaps, whom"
3039,POSSESSION.,"he meant to make his wife some day, when SHE should be only a shameful"
3040,POSSESSION.,memory!
3041,POSSESSION.,
3042,POSSESSION.,"It may have been the reproach of this infidelity, or the thought of his"
3043,POSSESSION.,"home, or the infatuation of his present guileful attachment, which kept"
3044,POSSESSION.,Ralph Flare from labor.
3045,POSSESSION.,
3046,POSSESSION.,"There was the great Louvre, filled with the riches of the old masters,"
3047,POSSESSION.,"and the galleries of the Luxembourg with the gems of the French school,"
3048,POSSESSION.,"so marvellous in color and so superb in composition, and the mighty"
3049,POSSESSION.,"museum of Versailles, with its miles of battle pictures--yet the third"
3050,POSSESSION.,"month of his tenure in Paris was hastening by, and he had not made one"
3051,POSSESSION.,copy.
3052,POSSESSION.,
3053,POSSESSION.,"Suzette was a bad model. She _posed_ twice, but changed her position,"
3054,POSSESSION.,"and yawned, and said it was ridiculous. He had never made more than a"
3055,POSSESSION.,"crayon portrait of her. He found, too, that five hundred francs a month"
3056,POSSESSION.,"barely sufficed to keep them, and once, in the interval of a remittance,"
3057,POSSESSION.,"they were in danger of hunger. Yet Suzette plied her needle bravely, and"
3058,POSSESSION.,was never so proud as when she had spread the dinner she had earned. In
3059,POSSESSION.,"acknowledgment of this fidelity Ralph took her to a grand _magasin_,"
3060,POSSESSION.,"where they examined the goods gravely, as married folks do, consulting"
3061,POSSESSION.,"each other, and trying to seem very sage and anxious."
3062,POSSESSION.,
3063,POSSESSION.,There probably was never such a bonnet as Suzette's in the world. It was
3064,POSSESSION.,"black, and full of white roses, and floating a defiant ostrich-plume,"
3065,POSSESSION.,"and tied with broad red ribbons, whereby she could be recognized from"
3066,POSSESSION.,one end of the Luxembourg gardens to the other.
3067,POSSESSION.,
3068,POSSESSION.,"The paletot was clever in like manner; she made the dress herself, and"
3069,POSSESSION.,"its fit was perfection, showing her plump little figure all the plumper,"
3070,POSSESSION.,"while its black color set off the whiteness of her simple collar, and"
3071,POSSESSION.,"with those magic gaiters, Ralph's gift also, he used to sit in the big"
3072,POSSESSION.,"chair, peering at her, and in a quandary as to whether he had ever been"
3073,POSSESSION.,"so happy before, or ever so disquieted."
3074,POSSESSION.,
3075,POSSESSION.,"""Now, my little woman,"" said Ralph, ""I have redeemed my promises; you"
3076,POSSESSION.,"have a chamber, and garments, and subsistence--more than any of your"
3077,POSSESSION.,friends--and I am with you always; few wives live so pleasantly; but
3078,POSSESSION.,"there is one thing which you must do."""
3079,POSSESSION.,
3080,POSSESSION.,"Suzette, sitting upon his knee, protested that he could not command any"
3081,POSSESSION.,impossible thing which she would not undertake.
3082,POSSESSION.,
3083,POSSESSION.,"""You must work a little; we are both idle, and if we continue so, may"
3084,POSSESSION.,have _ennui_ and may quarrel. After three days I will not pay for your
3085,POSSESSION.,"breakfasts, and every day in which you do not breakfast with me, paying"
3086,POSSESSION.,"for yourself, I will give you no dinner. Remember it, Suzette, for I am"
3087,POSSESSION.,"in earnest."""
3088,POSSESSION.,
3089,POSSESSION.,"Her color fell a little at this, for she had no love for the needle. It"
3090,POSSESSION.,"was merrier in the _boutique_ to chat with customers, yet she started"
3091,POSSESSION.,"fairly, and for a week earned a franc a day. The eighth day came; she"
3092,POSSESSION.,had no money. Ralph put on his hat and went down the _Rue L'École de
3093,POSSESSION.,"Médecin_ without her; but his breakfast was unpalatable, indigestible."
3094,POSSESSION.,"Five o'clock came round; she was sitting at the window, perturbedly"
3095,POSSESSION.,waiting to see how he would act.
3096,POSSESSION.,
3097,POSSESSION.,"It wrung his heart to think that she was hungry, but he tried to be very"
3098,POSSESSION.,firm.
3099,POSSESSION.,
3100,POSSESSION.,"""I am going to dinner, Suzette! I keep my word, you see."""
3101,POSSESSION.,
3102,POSSESSION.,"""It is well, Ralph."""
3103,POSSESSION.,
3104,POSSESSION.,"That night they said little to each other. The dovecote was quite cold,"

3106,POSSESSION.,Suzette made pretence of reading. She had an impenitent look; for she
3107,POSSESSION.,"conceived that she had been cruelly treated, and would not be soothed"
3108,POSSESSION.,"nor kissed. Ralph smoked, and said over some old rhymes, and, finally"
3109,POSSESSION.,"rising, put on his cloak."

3115,POSSESSION.,"He walked very slowly and heavily down the stairs, to convince her that"
3116,POSSESSION.,"he was really going or hoping to be recalled, but she did not speak. He"
3117,POSSESSION.,saw the light burning from his windows as he looked up from below. He
3118,POSSESSION.,was regretful and angry. At Terrapin's room he drank much raw brandy and
3119,POSSESSION.,"sang a song. He even called the astute Terrapin a humbug, and toward"
3120,POSSESSION.,midnight grew quarrelsome. They escorted him to his hotel door; the
3121,POSSESSION.,light was still burning in his room. He was sober and repentant when he
3122,POSSESSION.,"had ascended the long stairs, though he counterfeited profound"
3123,POSSESSION.,drunkenness when he stood before her.

3125,POSSESSION.,"She had been weeping, and in her white night-habit, with her dark hair"

3140,CONSCIENCE.,
3141,CONSCIENCE.,Lest it has not been made clear in these paragraphs whether Suzette was
3142,CONSCIENCE.,"a good or a wicked being, we may give the matured and recent judgment of"
3143,CONSCIENCE.,"Ralph Flare himself. Put to the test of religion, or even of"
3144,CONSCIENCE.,"respectability, this intimacy was baneful. A wild young man had broken"
3145,CONSCIENCE.,"his honor for the companionship of a poor, errant girl. She was poor,"
3146,CONSCIENCE.,but she hated to work; she had no regard for his money; she did not
3147,CONSCIENCE.,"share his ambition. Making against her a case thus clear and certain,"
3148,CONSCIENCE.,"Ralph Flare entered for Suzette the plea of _not_ wicked, and this was"
3149,CONSCIENCE.,his defence!
3150,CONSCIENCE.,
3151,CONSCIENCE.,_She was educated in France._ Particular sins lose their shame in some
3152,CONSCIENCE.,countries. Woman in France had not the high mission and respect which
3153,CONSCIENCE.,she fulfilled in his own land. Suzette was one of many children. Her
3154,CONSCIENCE.,father was the cultivator of a few acres in Normandy. Her mother died as
3155,CONSCIENCE.,the infant was ushered into the world. To her father and brothers she
3156,CONSCIENCE.,"was of an unprofitable sex, and her sisters disliked her because she"
3157,CONSCIENCE.,"was handsomer than they. Her childhood was cheerless enough, for she had"
3158,CONSCIENCE.,"quick instincts, and her education availed only to teach her how grand"
3159,CONSCIENCE.,"was the world, and how confined her life. She left her home by stealth,"
3160,CONSCIENCE.,"in the night, and alone. In the city of Cherbourg she found occupation."
3161,CONSCIENCE.,She dwelt with strangers; she was lonely; her poverty and her beauty
3162,CONSCIENCE.,were her sorrows. She was a girl only till her fifteenth year.
3163,CONSCIENCE.,
3164,CONSCIENCE.,The young mother has but one city of refuge--Paris. Without friends she
3165,CONSCIENCE.,passed the bitterness of reminiscence. Through the poverty of skill or
3166,CONSCIENCE.,"sustenance she lost her boy, and the great city lay all before her where"
3167,CONSCIENCE.,"to choose. Luckily, in France every avenue to struggle was not closed to"
3168,CONSCIENCE.,her sisterhood; with us such gather only the wages of sin. It was not
3169,CONSCIENCE.,there an irreparable disgrace to have fallen. For a full year she lived
3170,CONSCIENCE.,"purely, industriously, lonely; what adventures ensued Ralph knew"
3171,CONSCIENCE.,"imperfectly. She met, he believed that she loved him. It was not"
3172,CONSCIENCE.,"probable, of course, that she came out of the wrestle unscathed. She"
3173,CONSCIENCE.,"deceived in little things, but he knew when to trust her. She was"
3174,CONSCIENCE.,"quick-tempered and impatient of control, but he understood her, and"
3175,CONSCIENCE.,their quarrels were harbingers of their most happy seasons. She was
3176,CONSCIENCE.,"generous, affectionate, artless. He did not know among the similar"
3177,CONSCIENCE.,"attachments of his friends any creature so pliable, so true, so"
3178,CONSCIENCE.,beautiful.
3179,CONSCIENCE.,
3180,CONSCIENCE.,It was upon her acquaintances that Ralph placed the blame when she
3181,CONSCIENCE.,"erred. Fanchette was one of these--the dame of a student from Bretagne,"
3182,CONSCIENCE.,"a worldly, plotting, masculine woman--the only one whom he permitted to"
3183,CONSCIENCE.,"visit her. It was Fanchette who loaned her money when she was indolent,"
3184,CONSCIENCE.,and who prompted her to ask favors beyond his means.
3185,CONSCIENCE.,
3186,CONSCIENCE.,"Toward the end of every month Ralph's money ran out, and then he was"
3187,CONSCIENCE.,petulant and often upbraided her. Those were the only times when he
3188,CONSCIENCE.,"essayed to study, and he would not walk with her of evenings, so"
3189,CONSCIENCE.,"destitute. Then Fanchette amused her: ""Sew in my room,"" she would say;"
3190,CONSCIENCE.,"""Ralph will come for you at eight o'clock."" But Ralph never went, and"
3191,CONSCIENCE.,Fanchette poisoned his little girl's mind.
3192,CONSCIENCE.,
3193,CONSCIENCE.,"""When will you leave Paris, baby?"" said Suzette one evening, as she"
3194,CONSCIENCE.,returned from her friend's and found him sitting moodily by the fire.
3195,CONSCIENCE.,
3196,CONSCIENCE.,"""Very soon,"" he replied crisply; ""that is, if ever I have money or"
3197,CONSCIENCE.,"resolution enough to start."""
3198,CONSCIENCE.,
3199,CONSCIENCE.,"""Won't you take me with you, little one?"""
3200,CONSCIENCE.,
3201,CONSCIENCE.,"""No!"""
3202,CONSCIENCE.,
3203,CONSCIENCE.,"""You don't love me any more!"""
3204,CONSCIENCE.,
3205,CONSCIENCE.,"""Pish!"""
3206,CONSCIENCE.,
3207,CONSCIENCE.,"""Kiss me, my boy!"""
3208,CONSCIENCE.,
3209,CONSCIENCE.,"""Oh, go away, you bother me--you always bother me when my money is low."
3210,CONSCIENCE.,"Haven't I told you about it before?"""
3211,CONSCIENCE.,
3212,CONSCIENCE.,"But the next morning as Suzette made her toilet, older and more"
3213,CONSCIENCE.,"silently, he felt repentant, and called her to him, and they talked a"
3214,CONSCIENCE.,long while of nothingnesses. He had a cruel way of playing with her
3215,CONSCIENCE.,feelings.
3216,CONSCIENCE.,
3217,CONSCIENCE.,"""Suzette,"" he would say, ""would you like me to take you to my country"
3218,CONSCIENCE.,"and live with you forever?"""
3219,CONSCIENCE.,
3220,CONSCIENCE.,"""Very much, my child!"""
3221,CONSCIENCE.,
3222,CONSCIENCE.,"""My father has a beautiful farm, which he means to give to me. There is"
3223,CONSCIENCE.,"a grand old house upon it, and from the high porch you can see the blue"
3224,CONSCIENCE.,bay speckled with sails. The orchards are filled with apples and pears.
3225,CONSCIENCE.,"You must walk an hour to get around the corn-fields, and there is a"
3226,CONSCIENCE.,"picnic ground in the beech-woods, where we might entertain our friends."
3227,CONSCIENCE.,"I have many friends. How jolly you would look in my big rocking-chair,"
3228,CONSCIENCE.,"before the fireplace blazing with logs, and with your lap full of"
3229,CONSCIENCE.,"chestnuts, telling me of Paris life!"""
3230,CONSCIENCE.,
3231,CONSCIENCE.,"She was drinking it all in, and the blood was ripe in her cheeks."
3232,CONSCIENCE.,
3233,CONSCIENCE.,"""Think, little one,"" he said, ""of passing our days there, you and I! I"
3234,CONSCIENCE.,"have made you my wife, for example; I paint great pictures; you are"
3235,CONSCIENCE.,proud of me; everybody respects you; you have your saddle-horse and your
3236,CONSCIENCE.,tea-parties; you learn to be ashamed of what you were; you are anxious
3237,CONSCIENCE.,"to be better--not in people's eyes only, but in mine, in your own. To do"
3238,CONSCIENCE.,good deeds; to sit in the church hearing good counsel; to be patted upon
3239,CONSCIENCE.,the forehead by my father--his daughter!--and to call my brother your
3240,CONSCIENCE.,"brother also. Thus honored, contented, good, your hairs turn gray with"
3241,CONSCIENCE.,mine. We walk along hand in hand so evenly that we do not perceive how
3242,CONSCIENCE.,old we are growing. We may forget everything but our love; that remains
3243,CONSCIENCE.,"when we are gone--a part of our children's inheritance."""
3244,CONSCIENCE.,
3245,CONSCIENCE.,He spoke excellent French now; to her it was eloquence. Her arms were
3246,CONSCIENCE.,"around his neck. He could feel her heart, beating. He had expressed what"
3247,CONSCIENCE.,"she scarcely dared to conceive--all her holiest, profoundest hopes, her"
3248,CONSCIENCE.,"longing for what she had never been, for what she believed she would try"
3249,CONSCIENCE.,to be worthy of.
3250,CONSCIENCE.,
3251,CONSCIENCE.,"""Oh, my baby,"" she cried, half in tears, ""you make me think! I have"
3252,CONSCIENCE.,"never thought much or often; I wish I was a scholar, as you are, to tell"
3253,CONSCIENCE.,"you how, since we have dwelt together, something like that has come to"
3254,CONSCIENCE.,me in a dream. Perhaps it is because you talk to me so that I love you
3255,CONSCIENCE.,so greatly. Nobody ever spoke to me so before. That is why I am angry
3256,CONSCIENCE.,when your proud friend Lizzie writes to you. All that good fortune is
3257,CONSCIENCE.,for her; you are to quit Paris and me. My name will be unworthy to be
3258,CONSCIENCE.,"mentioned to her. How shall I be in this bad city, growing old; yet I"
3259,CONSCIENCE.,"would try so earnestly to improve and be grateful!"""
3260,CONSCIENCE.,
3261,CONSCIENCE.,"""Would you, truly, sweetheart?"""
3262,CONSCIENCE.,
3263,CONSCIENCE.,She only sobbed and waited; he coughed in a dry way and unclasped her
3264,CONSCIENCE.,hands.
3265,CONSCIENCE.,
3266,CONSCIENCE.,"""I pity you, poor Suzette,"" he said, ""but it is quite impossible for us"
3267,CONSCIENCE.,to be more to each other. My people would never speak to me if I behaved
3268,CONSCIENCE.,"so absurdly. Go to bed now, and stop crying; good-night."""
3269,CONSCIENCE.,
3270,CONSCIENCE.,"She staggered up, so crushed and bowed and haggard that his conscience"
3271,CONSCIENCE.,smote him. He could not have done a greater cruelty to one like
3272,CONSCIENCE.,"her--teaching her to hope, then to despair. The next day, and the next,"
3273,CONSCIENCE.,she worked at Fanchette's. His remittance did not come; he was out of
3274,CONSCIENCE.,"temper, and said in jest that he would set out for Italy within a week."
3275,CONSCIENCE.,There was a pale decision in her countenance the fourth morning. She put
3276,CONSCIENCE.,on her gray robe and a little cap which she had made. He did not offer
3277,CONSCIENCE.,"to kiss her, and she did not beseech it. He saw her no more until nine"
3278,CONSCIENCE.,"o'clock, when she came in with Fanchette, and her cheeks were flushed"
3279,CONSCIENCE.,as with wine. This made him more angry. He said nothing to either of
3280,CONSCIENCE.,them and went to sleep silently.
3281,CONSCIENCE.,
3282,CONSCIENCE.,The fifth day she returned as before. He was sitting up by the
3283,CONSCIENCE.,"fireplace; his rent was due; he was quite cast down, and said:"
3284,CONSCIENCE.,
3285,CONSCIENCE.,"""Dear, when my purse was full you never went away two whole days,"
3286,CONSCIENCE.,"leaving me alone."""
3287,CONSCIENCE.,
3288,CONSCIENCE.,"""You are to leave me, Ralph, forever!"" But she was touched, and in the"
3289,CONSCIENCE.,morning said that she would come back at midday. Still no remittance. He
3290,CONSCIENCE.,felt like a bear. Twelve o'clock came--Suzette did not appear. It
3291,CONSCIENCE.,drifted on to one; he listened vainly for her feet upon the stairs. At
3292,CONSCIENCE.,"two he sat at the window watching; she entered at three, half mild, half"
3293,CONSCIENCE.,"timorous, and gave him a paper of sugar plums."
3294,CONSCIENCE.,
3295,CONSCIENCE.,"""Where did those come from?"" he asked, with a scowl."
3296,CONSCIENCE.,
3297,CONSCIENCE.,"""Fanchette gave them to me."""
3298,CONSCIENCE.,
3299,CONSCIENCE.,"""I don't believe it; there is _kirsch wasser_ on your lips; you have"
3300,CONSCIENCE.,"been drinking."""
3301,CONSCIENCE.,
3302,CONSCIENCE.,"She drew her handkerchief from her pocket; a little box, gilt-edged,"
3303,CONSCIENCE.,"came out with it, and rolled into the middle of the floor. Suzette"
3304,CONSCIENCE.,leaped for it with a quick pallor; he wrenched it from her hands after a
3305,CONSCIENCE.,"fierce struggle, and delving into the soft cotton with which it was"
3306,CONSCIENCE.,"packed, brought out sleeve-buttons of gold and a pearl breastpin. They"
3307,CONSCIENCE.,"were new and glittering, and they flashed a burning suspicion into his"
3308,CONSCIENCE.,"heart. He forced her unresisting into a chair, and flung them far out of"
3309,CONSCIENCE.,"the window, over the house-roofs. Then he sat down a moment to gain"
3310,CONSCIENCE.,"breath, and marked her with eyes in which she saw that she was already"
3311,CONSCIENCE.,tried and sentenced.
3312,CONSCIENCE.,
3313,CONSCIENCE.,"""Who gave you those things, Suzette?"" he asked in a forced, strange"
3314,CONSCIENCE.,monotone.
3315,CONSCIENCE.,
3316,CONSCIENCE.,"""My ancient _patronne_."""
3317,CONSCIENCE.,
3318,CONSCIENCE.,"""What's her name?"""
3319,CONSCIENCE.,
3320,CONSCIENCE.,"""I don't know."""
3321,CONSCIENCE.,
3322,CONSCIENCE.,"""Where does she live?"""
3323,CONSCIENCE.,
3324,CONSCIENCE.,"""I shan't tell you."""
3325,CONSCIENCE.,
3326,CONSCIENCE.,He held her wrist tightly and pressed her back till her eyes were
3327,CONSCIENCE.,"compelled to mark his white, pinched lips and altogether bloodless"
3328,CONSCIENCE.,"temples. His hand tightened upon her; his full, boyish figure"
3329,CONSCIENCE.,straightened and heightened beyond nature; his regard was terrible. A
3330,CONSCIENCE.,terrible fear and silence fell around about them.
3331,CONSCIENCE.,
3332,CONSCIENCE.,"""These are the gifts of a man,"" he whispered; ""you do not know it better"
3333,CONSCIENCE.,than I. I shall walk out for one hour; at the end of that time there
3334,CONSCIENCE.,"must not be even a ribbon of yours in this chamber."""

3346,REMORSE.,"Terrapin. That philosopher was playing whist with his friends, and gave"

3348,REMORSE.,
3349,REMORSE.,"Ralph drank much, talked much, chafed more. Somebody advised him to"

3361,REMORSE.,
3362,REMORSE.,"The room in the fifth story was very cold now. He tried to read in bed,"
3363,REMORSE.,but the novel had no meaning in it. He walked up and down the balcony in
3364,REMORSE.,"the November night, where he had often explained the motions of the"
3365,REMORSE.,"stars to her. They seemed to miss her now, and peeped inquisitively. He"
3366,REMORSE.,"looked into the bureau and wardrobe, half ashamed of the hope that she"
3367,REMORSE.,had left some _souvenir_. There was not even a letter. She had torn a
3368,REMORSE.,"leaf, on which she had written her name, out of his diary. The sketches"
3369,REMORSE.,he had made of her were gone; if she had only taken her remembrance out
3370,REMORSE.,"of his heart, it would have been well. Then he reasoned, with himself,"
3371,REMORSE.,sensibly and consistently. It was a bad passion at first. How would it
3372,REMORSE.,have shamed his father and mother had they heard of it! Its continuance
3373,REMORSE.,"was even more pernicious, making him profligate and idle; introducing"
3374,REMORSE.,"him to light pleasures and companies; enfeebling him, morally and"
3375,REMORSE.,physically; diverting him from the beautiful arts; weakening his
3376,REMORSE.,parental love; divorcing him from grand themes and thoughts. He could
3377,REMORSE.,never marry this woman. Their heart-strings must have been wrung by some
3378,REMORSE.,"final parting; and now that she had been proved untrue, was it not most"
3379,REMORSE.,unmanly that he should permit her to stand even in the threshold of his
3380,REMORSE.,"mind? It was a good riddance, he said, pacing the floor in the"
3381,REMORSE.,"firelight; but just then he glanced into the great mirror, and stood"
3382,REMORSE.,"fixed to mark the pallor of his face. Say what he might, laugh as he"
3383,REMORSE.,"did, with a hollow sound, that absent girl had stirred the very"
3384,REMORSE.,"fountains of his feelings. Not learned, not beautiful, not anything to"
3385,REMORSE.,anybody but him--there was yet the difference between her love and her
3386,REMORSE.,"deceit, which made him content or wretched."
3387,REMORSE.,
3388,REMORSE.,"He felt this so keenly that he lifted his voice and cursed--himself,"
3389,REMORSE.,"her, society, mankind. Then he cried like a child, and called himself a"
3390,REMORSE.,"calf, and laughed bitterly, and cried again."
3391,REMORSE.,
3392,REMORSE.,There was no sleep for him that night. He drank brandy again in the
3393,REMORSE.,"morning, and walked to the banker's. His remittance awaited him, and he"
3394,REMORSE.,came out of the Rue de la Paix with thirty gold napoleons in his pocket.
3395,REMORSE.,
3396,REMORSE.,"He met all the Americans at breakfast at Trappe's in the Palais Royal,"
3397,REMORSE.,"and strolling to the morgue with a part of them, kept on to Vincennes,"
3398,REMORSE.,"and spent a wretched day in the forest. At the Place de la Bastille,"
3399,REMORSE.,"returning, he got into a cabriolet alone and searched ineffectually"
3400,REMORSE.,"along the Rue Rivoli for a companion who would ride with him. ""Go"
3401,REMORSE.,"through the Rue de Beaux Arts!"" he said, as they crossed Pont Neuf. This"
3402,REMORSE.,"is a quiet street in the Latin Quarter filled with cheap _pensions_, in"
3403,REMORSE.,one of which dwelt Fanchette. His heart was wedged in his throat as he
3404,REMORSE.,saw at the window little Suzette sewing. She wore one of the dresses he
3405,REMORSE.,had given her. Her face was old and piteous; she was red-eyed and worked
3406,REMORSE.,"wearily, looking into the street like one on a rainy day."
3407,REMORSE.,
3408,REMORSE.,"When she saw him, he thought, by her start and flush, that she was going"
3409,REMORSE.,"to fall from the chair; but then she looked with a dim, absent manner"
3410,REMORSE.,"into his face, like one who essays to remember something that was very"
3411,REMORSE.,dear but is now quite strange. He was pleased to think that she was
3412,REMORSE.,"miserable, and would have given much to have found her begging bread, as"
3413,REMORSE.,she did that night of him.
3414,REMORSE.,
3415,REMORSE.,"He had ridden by on purpose to show that he had money, and she sent him"
3416,REMORSE.,by Terrapin's word a petition for a few francs to buy her a chamber.
3417,REMORSE.,"Fanchette's friend had come home from the country, and it would not do"
3418,REMORSE.,"for her to occupy their single bedroom; but Ralph made reply by deputy,"
3419,REMORSE.,"to the effect that the donor of the jewelry would, he supposed, give her"
3420,REMORSE.,"a room. It was a weary week ensuing; he drank spirits all the time, and"
3421,REMORSE.,"made love to an English governess in the Tuileries garden, and when"
3422,REMORSE.,"Sunday came, with a rainy, windy, dismal evening, he went with Terrapin"
3423,REMORSE.,and Co. to the Closerie des Lilas.
3424,REMORSE.,
3425,REMORSE.,This is the great ball of the Latin Quarter. It stands near the barriers
3426,REMORSE.,"upon the Boulevard, and is haunted with students and grisettes. Commonly"
3427,REMORSE.,"it was thronged with waltzers, and the scene on gala nights, when all"
3428,REMORSE.,"the lamps were aflame, and the music drowned out by the thunder of the"
3429,REMORSE.,"dance, was a compromise between Paradise and Pandemonium. To-night there"
3430,REMORSE.,was a beggarly array of folk; the multitude of _garçons_ contemplated
3431,REMORSE.,"each other's white aprons, and old Bullier, the proprietor, staggering"
3432,REMORSE.,"under his huge hat, exhibited a desire to be taken out and interred. The"
3433,REMORSE.,"wild-eyed young man with flying, carroty locks, who stood in the set"
3434,REMORSE.,"directly under the orchestra, at that part of the floor called ""the"
3435,REMORSE.,"kitchen,"" was flinging up his legs without any perceptible enjoyment,"
3436,REMORSE.,"and the policemen in helmets, and cuirassiers, who had hard work to keep"
3437,REMORSE.,"order in general, looked like lay figures now, and strolled off into the"
3438,REMORSE.,embowered and sloppy gardens. There were not two hundred folk under the
3439,REMORSE.,roofs. Ralph had come here with the unacknowledged thought of meeting
3440,REMORSE.,"Suzette, and he walked around with his cigar, leaning upon Terrapin's"
3441,REMORSE.,arm and making himself disagreeable.
3442,REMORSE.,
3443,REMORSE.,Suddenly he came before her. She seemed to have arisen from the earth.
3444,REMORSE.,She looked so weak and haggard that he was impelled to speak to her; but
3445,REMORSE.,he was obdurate and hard-hearted. He could have filled her cup of
3446,REMORSE.,"bitterness and watched her drink it to the dregs, and would have been"
3447,REMORSE.,relentless if she was kneeling at his feet.
3448,REMORSE.,
3449,REMORSE.,"""Flare, what makes you tremble so?"" said Terrapin; ""are you cold?"
3450,REMORSE.,"Confound it, man, you are sick! Sit here in the draft and take some"
3451,REMORSE.,"cognac."""
3452,REMORSE.,
3453,REMORSE.,"""No,"" answered Ralph, ""I am all right again. You see my girl there?"
3454,REMORSE.,"(Don't look at her!) You know some of these girls, old fellow? I mean to"
3455,REMORSE.,treat two of them to a bottle of champagne. She will see it. I mean for
3456,REMORSE.,"her to do so. Who are these passing? Come with me."""
3457,REMORSE.,
3458,REMORSE.,"He walked by Suzette and her friend as if they had been invisible, and"
3459,REMORSE.,addressed those whom he pursued with such energy that they shrank back.
3460,REMORSE.,"He made one of them take his arm, and hurried here and there, saying"
3461,REMORSE.,"honeyed words all the time, by which she was affrighted; but every"
3462,REMORSE.,"smile, false as it was, fell into Suzette's heart."
3463,REMORSE.,
3464,REMORSE.,"Weary, wan, wretched, she kept them ever in view, crossing his path now"
3465,REMORSE.,"and then, in the vain thought that she might have one word from him,"
3466,REMORSE.,though it were a curse. He took his new friends into an alcove. She saw
3467,REMORSE.,"the wine burst from the bottle, and heard the clink of the glasses as"
3468,REMORSE.,they drank good health. She did not know that all his laughter was
3469,REMORSE.,"feigned, that his happiness was delirium, that his vows were lies. She"
3470,REMORSE.,"did not believe Ralph Flare so base as to put his foot upon her, whom he"
3471,REMORSE.,had already stricken down.
3472,REMORSE.,
3473,REMORSE.,"And he--he was all self, all stone!--he laid no offence at his own door."
3474,REMORSE.,He did not ask if her infidelity was real or if it had no warrant in his
3475,REMORSE.,"own slight and goading. The poor, pale face went after him"
3476,REMORSE.,reproachfully. Every painful footfall that she made was the patter of a
3477,REMORSE.,blood-drop. Such unnatural excitement must have some termination. He
3478,REMORSE.,quarrelled with a waiter. Old Bullier ordered a cuirassier to take him
3479,REMORSE.,"to the door; he would have resisted, but Terrapin whispered: ""Don't be"
3480,REMORSE.,"foolish, Flare; if you are put out it will be a triumph for the girl;"""
3481,REMORSE.,and only this conviction kept him calm. The cyprians whom he wooed
3482,REMORSE.,followed him out; he turned upon them bitterly when he had crossed the
3483,REMORSE.,"threshold, and leaping into a carriage was driven to his hotel, where"
3484,REMORSE.,he slept unquietly till daybreak.
3485,REMORSE.,
3486,REMORSE.,"See him, at dawn, in deep slumber! his face is sallow, his lips are dry,"
3487,REMORSE.,his chest heaves nervously as he breathes hard. It is a bad sleep; it is
3488,REMORSE.,"the sleep of bad children, to whom the fiend comes, knowing that the"
3489,REMORSE.,older they grow the more surely are they his own.
3490,REMORSE.,
3491,REMORSE.,"This is not, surely, the bashful young man who started at the phantom of"
3492,REMORSE.,"his mother, and sinned reluctantly. Aye! but those who do wrong after"
3493,REMORSE.,much admonishment are wickeder than those who obey the first bad
3494,REMORSE.,impulse. He is ten times more cast away who thinks and sins than he who
3495,REMORSE.,only sins and does not think.
3496,REMORSE.,
3497,REMORSE.,Ralph Flare was one of your reasoning villains. His conscience was not a
3498,REMORSE.,"better nature rising up in the man, and saying ""this is wrong."" It was"
3499,REMORSE.,"not conscience at all; it was only a fear. Far down as Suzette might be,"
3500,REMORSE.,"she never could have been unfeeling, unmerciful as he. It is a bad"
3501,REMORSE.,"character to set in black and white, yet you might ask old Terrapin or"
3502,REMORSE.,"any shrewd observer what manner of man was Ralph, and they would say,"
3503,REMORSE.,"""So-so-ish, a little sentimental, spooney likewise; but a good fellow, a"
3504,REMORSE.,"good fellow!"" And more curious than all, Suzette said so too."
3505,REMORSE.,
3506,REMORSE.,"He rose at daylight, and dressed and looked at himself in the glass. He"
3507,REMORSE.,felt that this would not do. His revenge had turned upon himself. He had
3508,REMORSE.,"half a mind to send for Suzette, and forgive her, and plead with her to"
3509,REMORSE.,come back again. The door opened: she of whom he thought stood before
3510,REMORSE.,"him, more marked and meagre than he; and the old tyranny mounted to his"
3511,REMORSE.,"eyes as he looked upon her. He knew that she had come to be pardoned, to"
3512,REMORSE.,"explain, and he determined that she should suffer to the quick."

3523,TYRANNY.,"might make Suzette give way at once under the burden of her grief, and"
3524,TYRANNY.,"rest upon a chair, and weep. On the contrary, she did just the opposite."
3525,TYRANNY.,She laughed.
3526,TYRANNY.,
3527,TYRANNY.,Human nature is consistent only in its inconsistencies. She meant to
3528,TYRANNY.,"break down in the end, but wished to intimidate him by a show of"
3529,TYRANNY.,"carelessness, so she first said quietly: ""Monsieur Ralph, I have come to"
3530,TYRANNY.,see to my washing; it went out with yours; will you tell the proprietor
3531,TYRANNY.,"to send it to me?"""
3532,TYRANNY.,
3533,TYRANNY.,"""Yes, madame."""
3534,TYRANNY.,
3535,TYRANNY.,"""May I sit down, sir? It is a good way up-stairs, and I want to breathe"
3536,TYRANNY.,"a minute."""
3537,TYRANNY.,
3538,TYRANNY.,"""As you like, madame."""
3539,TYRANNY.,
3540,TYRANNY.,He was resting on the sofa; she took a chair just opposite. There was a
3541,TYRANNY.,"table between them, and for a little while she looked with a ghastly"
3542,TYRANNY.,"playfulness into his eyes, he regarding her coldly and darkly; and then,"
3543,TYRANNY.,she laughed. It was a terrible laugh to come from a child's lips. It was
3544,TYRANNY.,"a woman's pride, drowning at the bottom of her heart, and in its last"
3545,TYRANNY.,struggle for preservation sending up these bubbles of sound.
3546,TYRANNY.,
3547,TYRANNY.,We talk of tragic scenes in common life; this was one of them. The
3548,TYRANNY.,"little room with its waxed, inlaid floor, the light falling bloodily in"
3549,TYRANNY.,"at the crimson curtains and throwing unreal shadows upon the spent fire,"
3550,TYRANNY.,"the disordered furniture, the unmade bed; and there were the two actors,"
3551,TYRANNY.,suffering in their little sphere what only _seems_ more suffering in
3552,TYRANNY.,"prisons and upon scaffolds, and playing with each other's agonies as not"
3553,TYRANNY.,more refined cruelty plays with racks and tortures.
3554,TYRANNY.,
3555,TYRANNY.,"""You are pleased, madame,"" said Ralph."
3556,TYRANNY.,
3557,TYRANNY.,"""No, I am wondering what has changed you. There are black circles around"
3558,TYRANNY.,your eyes; you have not shaved; the bones of your cheeks are sharp like
3559,TYRANNY.,"your chin, and you are yellow and bent like a dry leaf."""
3560,TYRANNY.,
3561,TYRANNY.,"""I have had an excess of money lately. Being free to do as I like, I"
3562,TYRANNY.,"have done so."""
3563,TYRANNY.,
3564,TYRANNY.,"She looked furtively around the room. ""Somebody has gone away from here"
3565,TYRANNY.,"this morning--is it true?"""
3566,TYRANNY.,
3567,TYRANNY.,He laughed suggestively.
3568,TYRANNY.,
3569,TYRANNY.,"""I saw you with two girls last night; the company did you honor; it was"
3570,TYRANNY.,"one of them, perhaps."""
3571,TYRANNY.,
3572,TYRANNY.,"""You guess shrewdly,"" he replied."
3573,TYRANNY.,
3574,TYRANNY.,"""This is her room now; it may be she will object to see me here."""
3575,TYRANNY.,
3576,TYRANNY.,"""You are right,"" said Ralph Flare, with mock courtesy, rising up. ""When"
3577,TYRANNY.,you lived with me I permitted no one to visit me in your absence. My
3578,TYRANNY.,late friends will be vexed. You have finished the business which brought
3579,TYRANNY.,"you here, and I must go to breakfast now."""
3580,TYRANNY.,
3581,TYRANNY.,"Ralph was a good actor. Had he thought Suzette really meant to go, he"
3582,TYRANNY.,would have fallen on his knees.
3583,TYRANNY.,
3584,TYRANNY.,"""Stop, Ralph, my boy,"" she cried. ""I know that you do not love me; I"
3585,TYRANNY.,can't see why I ever believed that you did. But let me sit with you a
3586,TYRANNY.,little while. You drove me from you once. I know that you have found
3587,TYRANNY.,"one to fill my place; but, _enfant_, I love you. I want to take your"
3588,TYRANNY.,"head in my arms as I have done a hundred times, and hear you say one"
3589,TYRANNY.,"kind word before we part forever."""
3590,TYRANNY.,
3591,TYRANNY.,"""There was a time,"" he said slowly, ""when you did not need my embraces."
3592,TYRANNY.,I was eager to give them. I did not give you kindness only; I gave you
3593,TYRANNY.,"nourishment, shelter, clothing, money. You were unworthy and ungrateful."
3594,TYRANNY.,You are nothing to me now. Do not think to wheedle me back to be your
3595,TYRANNY.,"fool again."""
3596,TYRANNY.,
3597,TYRANNY.,"""Oh! for charity, my child, not for love--I am too wretched to hope"
3598,TYRANNY.,"that--for pity, let me sit by your side five minutes. I cannot put it"
3599,TYRANNY.,"into words why I beg it, but it is a little thing to grant. If one"
3600,TYRANNY.,"starved you, or had stolen from you, and asked it so earnestly, you"
3601,TYRANNY.,would consent. I only want you to think less bitterly of me. You must
3602,TYRANNY.,"needs have some hard thoughts. I have done wrong, my boy, but you do not"
3603,TYRANNY.,"know all the cause, and as what I mean to say cannot make place in your"
3604,TYRANNY.,"breast for me now, you will know that it is true, because it has no"
3605,TYRANNY.,design. Oh! _Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!_ It is so hard to have but one deep
3606,TYRANNY.,"love, and yet find that love the greatest sorrow of one's life. It is so"
3607,TYRANNY.,"hard to have loved my boy so well, and to know that to the end of his"
3608,TYRANNY.,"days he hated me."""
3609,TYRANNY.,
3610,TYRANNY.,She said this with all the impetuosity of her race; with utter
3611,TYRANNY.,"abandonment of plan or effort, yet with a wild power of love and gesture"
3612,TYRANNY.,"which we know only upon the stage, but which in France is life, feeling,"
3613,TYRANNY.,reality.
3614,TYRANNY.,
3615,TYRANNY.,"She sat down and sobbed, raising her voice till it rolled with a shrill"
3616,TYRANNY.,"music which made him quiver, through the parted curtain and into the"
3617,TYRANNY.,"turbulent street. There were troops passing beneath the balcony, and the"
3618,TYRANNY.,"clangor of drums and bugles climbed between the stone walls, as if to"
3619,TYRANNY.,pour all its mockery into the little room.
3620,TYRANNY.,
3621,TYRANNY.,Ralph Flare hated to see a woman cry; it pained him more than her; so he
3622,TYRANNY.,lifted her in his arms and carried her to the sofa and placed her head
3623,TYRANNY.,upon his breast. For a long while she sat in that strange luxury of
3624,TYRANNY.,"grief, and she was fearful that he would send her away before her"
3625,TYRANNY.,"agitation could pass, and she might speak. His face wore an incredulous"
3626,TYRANNY.,"sneer as she spoke, though he knew it was absolute truth. She told him"
3627,TYRANNY.,"how wretched she had been, so wretched that even temptation respected"
3628,TYRANNY.,her; how she had never known the intensity of her passion for him till
3629,TYRANNY.,they were asunder; how all previous attachments were as ice to fire
3630,TYRANNY.,compared to this; and how the consciousness of its termination should
3631,TYRANNY.,make her desolate forever.
3632,TYRANNY.,
3633,TYRANNY.,"""I looked upon you,"" she said, ""as one whom I had trained up. Since I"
3634,TYRANNY.,have lost my little Jules I have needed something to care for. I taught
3635,TYRANNY.,you to speak my language as if you were a baby. You learned the coinage
3636,TYRANNY.,"of the land, and how to walk through the city, and all customs and"
3637,TYRANNY.,"places, precisely as a child learns them from his mother. Alas! you were"
3638,TYRANNY.,"wiser than I, and it made me sad to feel it. It was like the mother's"
3639,TYRANNY.,"regret that her boy is getting above her, in mind, in stature, so that"
3640,TYRANNY.,he shall be able to do without her. Yet with that fear there is a pride
3641,TYRANNY.,"like mine, when I felt that you were clever. Ah! Ralph, you loved to"
3642,TYRANNY.,"make me feel how weak and mean I was. You played with my poor heart,"
3643,TYRANNY.,"sick enough before, and little by little I felt your love gliding away"
3644,TYRANNY.,"from me, till at last you told me that it was gone. You said you should"
3645,TYRANNY.,"leave France, never to return--God forgive you if it was not true!--and"
3646,TYRANNY.,"when you treated me worst, I was tempted to hear kind words from"
3647,TYRANNY.,another. Fanchette's friend has a rich cousin who admires me. He is to
3648,TYRANNY.,"live in Paris many years. I never loved him, but I am poor, and many"
3649,TYRANNY.,women marry only for a home. He offered that and more to me. I would not
3650,TYRANNY.,hear it. Oh! if you had only said one tender word to me in those days of
3651,TYRANNY.,temptation. I begged you for it. When I was humblest at your feet you
3652,TYRANNY.,put your heel upon me most.
3653,TYRANNY.,
3654,TYRANNY.,"""One night when I had the greatest trouble of all he sat beside me and"
3655,TYRANNY.,"plied his suit, and was pleasanter, my boy, than you have ever been; and"
3656,TYRANNY.,"then, rising, he placed that box of jewelry in my lap and ran away. I"
3657,TYRANNY.,left it upon Fanchette's mantel that night. She filled my head with
3658,TYRANNY.,false thoughts next day. I never meant while you were in Paris to do you
3659,TYRANNY.,"any wrong; but I put those jewels in my pocket, meaning to give them up"
3660,TYRANNY.,"again; you found them, and I was made wretched."""
3661,TYRANNY.,
3662,TYRANNY.,"Ralph made that dry, biting cough which he used to express unbelief. She"
3663,TYRANNY.,only bent her head and wept silently.
3664,TYRANNY.,
3665,TYRANNY.,"""When all was gone, poor me! I have found much sorrow in my little life,"
3666,TYRANNY.,"but we are light-hearted in France, and we live and laugh again. Perhaps"
3667,TYRANNY.,you have made me more like one of your countrywomen. I do not
3668,TYRANNY.,know--only that I can never be happy any more.
3669,TYRANNY.,
3670,TYRANNY.,"""Since we have dwelt apart my tempter has been to see me every day. He"
3671,TYRANNY.,"has grand chambers which he will give me, and rich wardrobes, and a"
3672,TYRANNY.,"watch, and a voiture. It is a dazzling picture for one who toils, going"
3673,TYRANNY.,"all her days on foot, and lovely only to be deceived. But I hate that"
3674,TYRANNY.,"man now, because he has come between you and me, and I have slept upon"
3675,TYRANNY.,"my tears alone."""
3676,TYRANNY.,
3677,TYRANNY.,"She melted again into a long, loud wail, and he proposed nervously that"
3678,TYRANNY.,"they should walk into the gardens near by. He said little, and that"
3679,TYRANNY.,"contemptuously, tossing his cane at the birds, much interested in a"
3680,TYRANNY.,"statue, delighted with the visitors beneath the maroon trees; and she"
3681,TYRANNY.,"followed him here and there, very weak, for she had eaten no breakfast,"
3682,TYRANNY.,and not so deceived but she knew that he labored to wound her. He asked
3683,TYRANNY.,"her into a café, cavalierly, and was very careful to make display of his"
3684,TYRANNY.,"napoleons as he paid. He did not invite her, but she followed him to his"
3685,TYRANNY.,"hotel again, and here, as if with terrible _ennui_, he threw himself"
3686,TYRANNY.,"upon his bed and feigned to sleep, while she crouched at his table and"
3687,TYRANNY.,"wrote him a contrite letter. It was sweetly and simply worded, and asked"
3688,TYRANNY.,that he should let her return to him for his few remaining days in
3689,TYRANNY.,"Paris. If he could not grant so much, might she speak to him in the"
3690,TYRANNY.,"street; come to see him sometimes, if only to be reviled; love him,"
3691,TYRANNY.,though she could not hope to be loved? She gave him this note with her
3692,TYRANNY.,"face turned away, and faltered the request that he would think ere he"
3693,TYRANNY.,"replied, and hurried to the balcony without, that she might not trouble"
3694,TYRANNY.,him with the presence of her sorrow.
3695,TYRANNY.,
3696,TYRANNY.,"How the street beneath her, into which she looked, had changed since the"
3697,TYRANNY.,nights when they talked together upon this balcony! There was bright
3698,TYRANNY.,"sunshine, but it fell leeringly, not laughingly, upon the columns of the"
3699,TYRANNY.,"Odean Theatre, upon the crowds on the Boulevard, upon the decrepit baths"
3700,TYRANNY.,"of Julian, upon the far heights of Belleville, upon her more cheerlessly"
3701,TYRANNY.,than upon all.
3702,TYRANNY.,
3703,TYRANNY.,She listened timorously for his word of recall. She wondered if he were
3704,TYRANNY.,"not writing a reply. Yes, that was his manner; he was cold and sharp of"
3705,TYRANNY.,"speech, but he was an artist with his pen. She thought that her long"
3706,TYRANNY.,patience had moved him. Perhaps she should be all forgiven. Aye! they
3707,TYRANNY.,should dwell together a few days longer. It was a dismal thought that it
3708,TYRANNY.,"must be for a few days, yet that would be some respite, and then they"
3709,TYRANNY.,could part friends; though her heart so clung to his that a parting
3710,TYRANNY.,"should rend it from her, she wanted to live over their brief happiness"
3711,TYRANNY.,again.
3712,TYRANNY.,
3713,TYRANNY.,"""Oh!"" said Suzette, in the end, laying her cheek upon the cold iron of"
3714,TYRANNY.,"the balcony, ""I wish I had died at my father's home of pining for"
3715,TYRANNY.,"something to love rather than to have loved thus truly, and have it"
3716,TYRANNY.,accounted my shame. If I were married to this man I could not be his
3717,TYRANNY.,fonder wife; but because I am not he despises me. All day I have crawled
3718,TYRANNY.,in the dust; I have made myself cheap in his eyes. If I were prouder he
3719,TYRANNY.,"might not love me more, but his respect would be something."""
3720,TYRANNY.,
3721,TYRANNY.,She rallied and took heart. Pride is the immortal part of woman. With a
3722,TYRANNY.,"brighter eye she entered the room. Her letter, blotted with tears, lay"
3723,TYRANNY.,"crumpled and torn upon the floor at his bedside, and he, with his face"
3724,TYRANNY.,"to the wall, was snoring sonorously."
3725,TYRANNY.,
3726,TYRANNY.,"""Ralph Flare,"" cried Suzette, ""arise! that letter is the last olive"
3727,TYRANNY.,"branch you shall ever see in my hand; _adieu_!"""
3728,TYRANNY.,
3729,TYRANNY.,"He opened his eyes yawningly. Suzette, with trembling lips and nostrils,"
3730,TYRANNY.,clasped the door-knob. It shut behind her with a shock. Her feet were
3731,TYRANNY.,"quick upon the stairs; he pursued her like one suddenly gone mad, and"
3732,TYRANNY.,called her back with something between a moan and a howl.
3733,TYRANNY.,
3734,TYRANNY.,"""Do not go away, Suzette,"" he cried; ""I only jested. I meant this"
3735,TYRANNY.,morning to search you out and beg you to come back. I would not lose you
3736,TYRANNY.,for France--for the world. Be not rash or retaliatory! become not the
3737,TYRANNY.,companion of this Frenchman who has divided us. We will commence again.
3738,TYRANNY.,I have tested your fidelity. You shall have all the liberty that you
3739,TYRANNY.,"need, everything that I have; say to me, sweetheart, that you will"
3740,TYRANNY.,"stay!"""
3741,TYRANNY.,
3742,TYRANNY.,For a moment her bright eyes were scintillant with wrath and
3743,TYRANNY.,indignation. He who had racked her all day for his pleasure was bound
3744,TYRANNY.,and prostrate now. Should she not do as much for her revenge?
3745,TYRANNY.,
3746,TYRANNY.,"""I have no other friend now,"" he pleaded; ""my nights have been"
3747,TYRANNY.,"sleepless, solitary. In the days I have drunk deeply, squandered my"
3748,TYRANNY.,"money, tried all dissipations, and proved them disappointments. If you"
3749,TYRANNY.,"leave me I swear that I will plague myself and you."""
3750,TYRANNY.,
3751,TYRANNY.,"""Oh! Ralph,"" said Suzette, ""I do not wonder at the artfulness of women"
3752,TYRANNY.,after this day's lesson. Something impels me to return your cruelty; it
3753,TYRANNY.,"is a bad impulse, and I shall disobey it. I thank God, my baby, that I"
3754,TYRANNY.,"cannot do as you have done to me."""
3755,TYRANNY.,
3756,TYRANNY.,"She wept again for the last time, but he kissed her tears away, and"

3772,DESERTION.,"To see that he commenced fairly, she went with him into the Louvre, and"

3789,DESERTION.,work easier as she progressed. She was finally promoted to the place of
3790,DESERTION.,"_coupeur_, or cutter, and had the superintendence of a work-room, where"
3791,DESERTION.,"she made four francs a day, and so paid all her expenses. At the end of"
3792,DESERTION.,the second month he took the money which he otherwise would have
3793,DESERTION.,"required for board, and bought her a watch and chain at the _Palais"
3794,DESERTION.,"Royale_. At the same time he put the finishing touch to his picture, and"
3795,DESERTION.,"when hung upon his wall, between their photographs, Suzette danced"
3796,DESERTION.,"before it, and took half the credit upon herself."
3797,DESERTION.,
3798,DESERTION.,Foolish Suzette! she did not know how that old man was her most
3799,DESERTION.,dangerous rival. He had done what no beautiful woman in France could
3800,DESERTION.,do--weakened her grasp upon Ralph Flare's heart. For now Ralph's old
3801,DESERTION.,enthusiasm for his profession reasserted itself. It was his first and
3802,DESERTION.,deepest love after all.
3803,DESERTION.,
3804,DESERTION.,"""My baby,"" he said one night, ""there was a great artist named"
3805,DESERTION.,"Raphael--and he had a little mistress, whom I don't think a whit"
3806,DESERTION.,"prettier than mine. She was called the _Fornarina_, just as you may be"
3807,DESERTION.,"called the _Coutouriere_, and he painted her portrait in the characters"
3808,DESERTION.,"of saints and of the Virgin. She will be remembered a thousand years,"
3809,DESERTION.,because Raphael so loved and painted her. But he was not a great artist
3810,DESERTION.,only because he loved the _Fornarina_. He had something that he loved
3811,DESERTION.,"better, and so have I."""
3812,DESERTION.,
3813,DESERTION.,"""One more beloved than Suzette?"" she cried."
3814,DESERTION.,
3815,DESERTION.,"""Yes! it is art. I loved you more than my art before; but I am going"
3816,DESERTION.,"back to my first love."""
3817,DESERTION.,
3818,DESERTION.,Suzette tossed her head and said that she could never be jealous of a
3819,DESERTION.,"picture, and went her way with a simple faith and toiled; and as she"
3820,DESERTION.,"toiled the more, so grew her love the purer and her content the more"
3821,DESERTION.,equal. She was not the aerial thing she had been. Retaining her
3822,DESERTION.,"elasticity of spirit, she was less volatile, more silent, more careful,"
3823,DESERTION.,more anxious.
3824,DESERTION.,
3825,DESERTION.,"It is wiser, not happier, to reach that estate called thought; for now"
3826,DESERTION.,she asked herself very often how long this chapter of her life would
3827,DESERTION.,last. Must the time come when he must leave her forever? She thought it
3828,DESERTION.,"the bitterest of all to part as they had done before, with anger; but"
3829,DESERTION.,any parting must be agony where she had loved so well. As he lay
3830,DESERTION.,"sleeping, he never knew what tears of midnight were plashing upon his"
3831,DESERTION.,face. He could not see how her little heart was bleeding as it throbbed.
3832,DESERTION.,"Yet she went right on, though sometimes the tears blinded her, till she"
3833,DESERTION.,could not see her needle; but the consciousness that this love and labor
3834,DESERTION.,"had made her life more sanctified was, in some sort, compensation."
3835,DESERTION.,
3836,DESERTION.,"One Sunday she rose before Ralph, and thinking that she was unobserved,"
3837,DESERTION.,"stole out of the hotel and up the Boulevard. He followed her,"
3838,DESERTION.,"suspiciously. She crossed the Place de la Sorbonne, turned the transept"
3839,DESERTION.,"of the Pantheon, and entered the old church of St. Etienne du Mont."
3840,DESERTION.,
3841,DESERTION.,It was early mass. The tapers which have been burning five hundred years
3842,DESERTION.,glistened upon the tomb of the holy St. Genevieve. Here and there old
3843,DESERTION.,"women and girls were kneeling in the chapels, whispering their sins into"
3844,DESERTION.,the ears of invisible priests. And beneath the delicate tracery of
3845,DESERTION.,"screen and staircase, and the gloriously-painted windows, and the image"
3846,DESERTION.,"of Jesus crucified looking down upon all, some groups of poor people"
3847,DESERTION.,were murmuring their prayers and making the sign of the cross.
3848,DESERTION.,
3849,DESERTION.,Ralph entered by a door in the choir. He saw Suzette stand pallidly
3850,DESERTION.,"beside the holy water, and when she had touched it with the tips of her"
3851,DESERTION.,"fingers, and made the usual rites, she staggered, as if in shame, to a"
3852,DESERTION.,"remote chair, and kneeling down covered her face with her missal. Now"
3853,DESERTION.,"and then the organ boomed out. The censers were swung aloft, dispensing"
3854,DESERTION.,"their perfumes, and all the people made obeisance. Ralph did not know"
3855,DESERTION.,"what it all meant. He only saw his little girl penitent and in prayer,"
3856,DESERTION.,and he knew that she was carrying her sin and his to the feet of the
3857,DESERTION.,Eternal Mercy.
3858,DESERTION.,
3859,DESERTION.,"He feigned sleep in the same way each Sunday succeeding, and she"
3860,DESERTION.,"disappeared as before. After a while she spoke of her family, and"
3861,DESERTION.,wondered if her father would forgive her. She would not have forgiven
3862,DESERTION.,"him three months ago, but was quite humble now."
3863,DESERTION.,
3864,DESERTION.,"She sent her photograph to the old man, and a letter came back, the"
3865,DESERTION.,first she had received for two years.
3866,DESERTION.,
3867,DESERTION.,"She felt unwilling, also, to receive further gifts or support from"
3868,DESERTION.,"Ralph. If I were his wife, she said, it might be well, but since it is"
3869,DESERTION.,"not so, I must not be dependent."
3870,DESERTION.,
3871,DESERTION.,Foolish Suzette again! She did not know that men love best where they
3872,DESERTION.,most protect. The wife who comes with a dower may climb as high as her
3873,DESERTION.,"husband's pocket, but seldom lies snugly at his heart. Her changed"
3874,DESERTION.,conduct did not draw him closer to her. He felt uneasy and unworthy. He
3875,DESERTION.,missed the artfulness which had been so winning. He had jealousies no
3876,DESERTION.,"longer to keep his passion quick, for he could not doubt her devotion."
3877,DESERTION.,"There was nothing to lack in Suzette, and that was a fault. She had"
3878,DESERTION.,"become modest, docile, truthful, grave. A noble man might have"
3879,DESERTION.,"appreciated her the better. Ralph Flare was a representative man, and he"
3880,DESERTION.,did not.
3881,DESERTION.,
3882,DESERTION.,His friends in America thought his copy from Rembrandt wonderful. Their
3883,DESERTION.,"flattery made his ambition glow and flame. His mother, whose woman's"
3884,DESERTION.,"instinct divined the cause of his delay in Paris, sent him a pleading"
3885,DESERTION.,"letter to go southward; and thus reprimanded, praised, rewarded, what"
3886,DESERTION.,was he to do?
3887,DESERTION.,
3888,DESERTION.,He resolved to leave France--and without Suzette!
3889,DESERTION.,
3890,DESERTION.,He had not courage to tell her that the separation was final. He spoke
3891,DESERTION.,"of an excursion merely, and took but a handful of baggage. She had"
3892,DESERTION.,"doubts that were like deaths to her; but she believed him, and after a"
3893,DESERTION.,feverish night went with him in the morning to the train. He was to
3894,DESERTION.,write every day.
3895,DESERTION.,
3896,DESERTION.,Would she take money?
3897,DESERTION.,
3898,DESERTION.,"""No."""
3899,DESERTION.,
3900,DESERTION.,"But she might have unexpected wants--sickness, accident, charity?"
3901,DESERTION.,
3902,DESERTION.,"""If so,"" she said trustfully, ""would not her boy come back?"""
3903,DESERTION.,
3904,DESERTION.,He had just time to buy his ticket and gain the platform. He folded her
3905,DESERTION.,"in his arms, and exchanged one long, sobbing kiss. It seemed to Ralph"
3906,DESERTION.,Flare that the sound of that kiss was like a spell--the breaking of the
3907,DESERTION.,pleasantest link in his life--the passing from sinfulness to a baser
3908,DESERTION.,"selfishness--the stamp and seal upon his bargain with ambition, whereby"
3909,DESERTION.,for the long future he was sold to the sorrow of avarice and the
3910,DESERTION.,deceitfulness of fame.
3911,DESERTION.,
3912,DESERTION.,There was a sharp whistle from the locomotive--who invented that whistle
3913,DESERTION.,to pierce so many bosoms at parting?--the cars moved one by one till the
3914,DESERTION.,"last, in which he was seated, sprang forward with a jerk; and though she"
3915,DESERTION.,"was quite blind, he saw her handkerchief waving till all had vanished,"
3916,DESERTION.,and he would have given the world to have shed one tear.
3917,DESERTION.,
3918,DESERTION.,"He has gone on into the free country, and to-night he will sleep under"
3919,DESERTION.,the shadow of the mountains.
3920,DESERTION.,
3921,DESERTION.,"She has turned back into the dark city, and she will not sleep at all in"
3922,DESERTION.,her far-up chamber.
3923,DESERTION.,
3924,DESERTION.,"It is only one heart crushed, and thousands that deserve more sympathy"
3925,DESERTION.,beat out every day. We only notice this one because it shall lie
3926,DESERTION.,"bleeding, and get no sympathy at all."

3935,DISSOLVING VIEW.,
3936,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"That he might not meet with his own countrymen, Ralph halted at Milan,"
3937,DISSOLVING VIEW.,and in the great deserted gallery of the Brera went steadily to work.
3938,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"If, as it often happened, Suzette's pale face got between him and the"
3939,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"canvas, he mentioned his own name and said ""renown,"" and took a turn in"
3940,DISSOLVING VIEW.,the remote corridor where young Raphael's _Sposializo_ hung opposite
3941,DISSOLVING VIEW.,that marvel of Guercino's--poor Hagar and her boy Ishmael driven
3942,DISSOLVING VIEW.,abroad. These adjuncts and the fiercer passion of self had their effect.
3943,DISSOLVING VIEW.,
3944,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"He never wrote to Suzette, but sent secretly for his baggage, and was"
3945,DISSOLVING VIEW.,well pleased with the consciousness that he could forget her. After
3946,DISSOLVING VIEW.,three months he set out for Florence and studied the masterpieces of
3947,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"Andrea del Sarto, and tried his hand at the _Flora_ of Titian."
3948,DISSOLVING VIEW.,
3949,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"He went into society somewhat, and was very much afraid his unworthy"
3950,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"conduct in Paris might be bruited abroad. Indeed, he could hardly"
3951,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"forgive himself the fondness he had known, and came to regard Suzette as"
3952,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"a tolerably bad person, who had bewitched him. He burned all her"
3953,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"letters, and a little lock of hair he had clipped while she was asleep"
3954,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"once, and blotted the whole experience out of his diary. The next Sunday"
3955,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"he went to hear the Rev. Mr. Hall preach, and felt quite consoled."
3956,DISSOLVING VIEW.,
3957,DISSOLVING VIEW.,The summer fell upon Val d'Arno like the upsetting of a Tuscan
3958,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"_Scaldino_, and Ralph Flare regretfully took his departure northward."
3959,DISSOLVING VIEW.,All the world was going to Paris--why not he? Was he afraid? Certainly
3960,DISSOLVING VIEW.,not; it had been a great victory over temptation to stay away so long.
3961,DISSOLVING VIEW.,He would carry out the triumph by braving a return.
3962,DISSOLVING VIEW.,
3963,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"In accordance with his principles of economy, he took a third-class"
3964,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"ticket at Basle. He could so make better studies of passengers; for,"
3965,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"somehow, your first-class people have not character faces. The only"
3966,DISSOLVING VIEW.,character you get out of them is the character of wine they consume.
3967,DISSOLVING VIEW.,
3968,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"He left the Alps behind him, and rolled all day through the prosaic"
3969,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"plains of France; startling the pale little towns, down whose treeless"
3970,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"streets the sun shone, oh! so drearily, and taking up boors and"
3971,DISSOLVING VIEW.,market-folks at every monastic station. There was a pretty young girl
3972,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"sitting beside Ralph in the afternoon, but he refused to talk to her,"
3973,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"for he was schooling himself, and preferred to scan the features of an"
3974,DISSOLVING VIEW.,odd old couple who got in at Troyes.
3975,DISSOLVING VIEW.,
3976,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"They were two old people of the country, and they sat together in the"
3977,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"descending shadows of the day, quite like in garb and feature, their"
3978,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"chins a little peakish, and the hairs of both turning gray. The man was"
3979,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"commonplace, as he leaned upon a staff, and between their feet were"
3980,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"paniers of purchases they had been making, which the woman regarded"
3981,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"indifferently, as if her heart reached farther than her eyes, and met"
3982,DISSOLVING VIEW.,some soft departed scene which she would have none other see.
3983,DISSOLVING VIEW.,
3984,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"""She has a good face,"" said Flare. ""I wish she would keep there a moment"
3985,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"more. By George, she looks like somebody I have known."""
3986,DISSOLVING VIEW.,
3987,DISSOLVING VIEW.,The old man nodded on his staff. The rumble of the carriages subdued to
3988,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"a lull all lesser talk or murmurs, and the sky afar off brought into"
3989,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"sharp relief the two Gallic profiles, close together, as if they were"
3990,DISSOLVING VIEW.,used to reposing so; yet in the language of their deepening lines lay
3991,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"the stories of lives very, very wide apart."
3992,DISSOLVING VIEW.,
3993,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"""The old girl's face is soft,"" said Ralph Flare. ""She has brightened"
3994,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"many a bit of Belgian pike road, and the brown turban on her head is in"
3995,DISSOLVING VIEW.,clever contrast to the silver shimmer of her hairs. How anomalous are
3996,DISSOLVING VIEW.,life and art! How unconscious is this old lady of the narrow escape she
3997,DISSOLVING VIEW.,is making from perpetuation! Doubtless she works afield beside that old
3998,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"Jacques Bonhomme, and drinks sour wine or Normandy cider on Sundays."
3999,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"That may be the best fate of Suzette, but it must be an amply dry"
4000,DISSOLVING VIEW.,reformation for any little grisette to contemplate. For such prodigals
4001,DISSOLVING VIEW.,going home there is no fatted calf slain. No fathers see them afar off
4002,DISSOLVING VIEW.,and run to place the ring upon their fingers. They renounce precarious
4003,DISSOLVING VIEW.,gayety for persistent slavery. The keen wit of the student is exchanged
4004,DISSOLVING VIEW.,for the pipe and mug and dull oath of the boor. I wish every such girl
4005,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"back again to so sallow a fate, and pity her when she gets there."""
4006,DISSOLVING VIEW.,
4007,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"And so, with much unconscious sentimentality, and the two old market"
4008,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"people silent before him, Ralph Flare's eyes half closed also, and the"
4009,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"lull of the wheels, the long lake streaks of the sedative skies, the"
4010,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"coming of great shadows like compulsions to slumber, made his forehead"
4011,DISSOLVING VIEW.,fall and the world go up and down and darken.
4012,DISSOLVING VIEW.,
4013,DISSOLVING VIEW.,It was the old woman who shook him from that repose; she only touched
4014,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"him, but her touch was like a lost sense restored. He thrilled and sat"
4015,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"stock still, with her withered blue hand on his arm, and heard the"
4016,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"pinched lips say, unclosing with a sort of quiver:"
4017,DISSOLVING VIEW.,
4018,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"""Baby!"""
4019,DISSOLVING VIEW.,
4020,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"He looked again, and seemed to himself to grow quite old as he looked,"
4021,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"and he said,"
4022,DISSOLVING VIEW.,
4023,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"""_Enfant perdu!_"""
4024,DISSOLVING VIEW.,
4025,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"The turban kept its place, the peaked chin kept as peaked; there seemed"
4026,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"even more silver in the smooth hair, and the old serge gown drooped as"
4027,DISSOLVING VIEW.,brownly; but the sweet old face grew soft as a widow's looking at the
4028,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"only portrait she guards, and a tear, like a drop of water exhumed, ran"
4029,DISSOLVING VIEW.,to the tip of her nostril.
4030,DISSOLVING VIEW.,
4031,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"""Suzette!"" he said, ""my early sin; do you come back as well with the"
4032,DISSOLVING VIEW.,turning of my hairs? Has the first passion a shadow long as forever? Why
4033,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"have we met?"""
4034,DISSOLVING VIEW.,
4035,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"""Not of my seeking was this meeting, Ralph. Speak softly, for my husband"
4036,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"sleeps, and he is old like thee and me. If my face is an accusation, let"
4037,DISSOLVING VIEW.,my lips be forgiveness. The love of you made my life dutiful; the loss
4038,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"of you saddened my days, but it was the sadness of religion! I sinned no"
4039,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"more, and sought my father's fields, and delayed, with my hand purified"
4040,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"by his blessing, the residue of his sands of life. I made my years good"
4041,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"to my neighbors, the sick, the bereaved. I met the temptations of the"
4042,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"young with a truer story than pleasure tells, and when I married it was"
4043,DISSOLVING VIEW.,with the prelude of my lost years related and forgiven. With children's
4044,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"faces the earnestness and beauty of life returned; for this, for more,"
4045,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"for all, may your reward be bountiful!"""
4046,DISSOLVING VIEW.,
4047,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"There is no curse like the dream of old age. Ralph Flare felt, with the"
4048,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"sudden whitening of each separate hair, the sudden remembrance of each"
4049,DISSOLVING VIEW.,separate folly; and the moments of grief he had wrung from the little
4050,DISSOLVING VIEW.,girl of the Quartier Latin revived like one's mean acts seen through
4051,DISSOLVING VIEW.,others' eyes.
4052,DISSOLVING VIEW.,
4053,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"""Pardon you, child, Suzette?"" he said; ""to me you were more than I"
4054,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"hoped, more than I wished. I asked your face only, and you gave me your"
4055,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"heart. For the unfaithfulness, for the wrath, for the unmanliness, for"
4056,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"the tyranny with which I treated you, my soul upbraids me."""
4057,DISSOLVING VIEW.,
4058,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"""How thankful am I,"" she answered; ""the terror to me was that you had"
4059,DISSOLVING VIEW.,learned in the Quartier lessons to make your after-life monotonous. I am
4060,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"happy."""
4061,DISSOLVING VIEW.,
4062,DISSOLVING VIEW.,Their hands met; to his gray beard fell the smile upon her mouth; they
4063,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"forget the Quartier Latin; they felt no love but forgiveness, which is"
4064,DISSOLVING VIEW.,the tenderest of emotions. The whistle blew shrilly; the train stopped;
4065,DISSOLVING VIEW.,Ralph Flare awoke from sleep; but the old couple were gone.
4066,DISSOLVING VIEW.,
4067,DISSOLVING VIEW.,"He went to Paris, and, contrary to his purpose, inquired for her. She"
4068,DISSOLVING VIEW.,had been seen by none since his departure. He wrote to the Maire of her

4195,THE MURDER.,
4196,THE MURDER.,
4197,THE MURDER.,"Between the Delaware River and Girard Avenue, which is the market street"
4198,THE MURDER.,"of the future, and east of Frankfort Road, lies Kensington, a"
4199,THE MURDER.,"respectable old district of the Quaker City, and occupying the same"
4200,THE MURDER.,relation to it that Kensington in England does to London. Beyond both
4201,THE MURDER.,"Kensingtons is a Richmond, but the English Richmond is a beauteous hill,"
4202,THE MURDER.,"with poetical recollections of Pope and Thomson, while our Richmond is"
4203,THE MURDER.,"the coal district of Philadelphia, flat to the foot and dingy to the"
4204,THE MURDER.,eye.
4205,THE MURDER.,
4206,THE MURDER.,"Kensington, however, was once no faint miniature of the staid British"
4207,THE MURDER.,suburb. The river bending to the eastward there conducts certain of the
4208,THE MURDER.,streets crookedly away from the rectangular Quaker demon who is ever
4209,THE MURDER.,"seeking to square them. Along the water side, or near it, passes a sort"
4210,THE MURDER.,"of Quay Street, between ship-yards and fish-houses on the one side, and"
4211,THE MURDER.,"shops or small tenements on the other, and this street scarcely"
4212,THE MURDER.,"discloses the small monument on the site of the Treaty Tree, where"
4213,THE MURDER.,William Penn in person satisfied the momentary expectations of his
4214,THE MURDER.,Indian subjects.
4215,THE MURDER.,
4216,THE MURDER.,"Nearly parallel to the water side street is another, wider and more"
4217,THE MURDER.,"aristocratic, and lined with many handsome dwellings of brick, or even"
4218,THE MURDER.,"brown-stone, where the successful shipbuilders, fishtakers, coal men,"
4219,THE MURDER.,and professional classes have established themselves or their posterity.
4220,THE MURDER.,"This street was once called Queen, afterward Richmond Street, and it is"
4221,THE MURDER.,"crossed by others, as Hanover, Marlborough, and Shackamaxon, which"
4222,THE MURDER.,attest in their names the duration of royal and Indian traditions
4223,THE MURDER.,"hereabout. Pleasant maple, sometimes sycamore and willow trees shade"
4224,THE MURDER.,"these old streets, and they are kept as clean as any in this ever-mopped"
4225,THE MURDER.,"and rinsed metropolis, while the society, though disengaged from the"
4226,THE MURDER.,"great city, had its better and worser class, and was fastidious about"
4227,THE MURDER.,"morals and behavior, and not disinclined to express its opinion."
4228,THE MURDER.,
4229,THE MURDER.,One winter day in a certain year Kensington had a real sensation. The
4230,THE MURDER.,"Delaware was frozen from shore to shore, and one could walk on the ice"
4231,THE MURDER.,"from Smith's to Treaty Island, and from Cooper's Point to the mouth of"
4232,THE MURDER.,the Cohocksink. On the second afternoon of the great freeze fires were
4233,THE MURDER.,"built on the river, and crowds assembled at certain smooth places to see"
4234,THE MURDER.,great skaters like Colonel Page cut flourishes and show sly gallantry to
4235,THE MURDER.,the buxom housewives and grass widows of Kensington and the Jerseys. A
4236,THE MURDER.,"few horses were driven on the ice, and hundreds of boys ran merrily with"
4237,THE MURDER.,real sleighs crowded down with their friends. A fight or two was
4238,THE MURDER.,"improvised, and unlicensed vendors set forth the bottle that inebriates."
4239,THE MURDER.,"In the midst of the afternoon gayety a small boy, kneeling down to"
4240,THE MURDER.,"buckle up to a farther hole the straps on his guttered skates, saw just"
4241,THE MURDER.,at his toe something like human hair. The small boy rose to his feet and
4242,THE MURDER.,"stamped with all his might around that object, not in any apprehension"
4243,THE MURDER.,but because small boys like to know; and when the ice had been well
4244,THE MURDER.,"broken, kneeling down and pulling it out in pieces with his mitten, the"
4245,THE MURDER.,"small boy felt something cold and smooth, and then he poked his finger"
4246,THE MURDER.,into a human eye. It was a dead man. No sooner had the urchin found this
4247,THE MURDER.,"out than he bellowed out at the top of his voice, running and falling as"
4248,THE MURDER.,"he yelled: ""Murder! Murder! Murder!"""
4249,THE MURDER.,
4250,THE MURDER.,"From all parts of the ice, like flies chasing over a silver salver"
4251,THE MURDER.,"toward some sweet point of corruption, the hundreds and thousands"
4252,THE MURDER.,swarmed at the news that a dead body had been found. When they arrived
4253,THE MURDER.,"on the spot, spades, picks, and ice-hooks had been procured by those"
4254,THE MURDER.,"nearest shore, and the whole mystery brought from the depths of the"
4255,THE MURDER.,river to the surface.
4256,THE MURDER.,
4257,THE MURDER.,"There lay together on the ice two men, apparently several days in the"
4258,THE MURDER.,"water, and with the usual look of drowned people of good"
4259,THE MURDER.,"condition--glassy and of fixed expression, as if in the moment of death"
4260,THE MURDER.,"a consenting grimness had stolen into their countenances, neither"
4261,THE MURDER.,composed nor terrified.
4262,THE MURDER.,
4263,THE MURDER.,The bodies had been already recognized when the main part of the crowd
4264,THE MURDER.,"arrived. Kensington people, generally, knew them both."
4265,THE MURDER.,
4266,THE MURDER.,"""It's William Zane and his business partner, Sayler Rainey! They own one"
4267,THE MURDER.,"of the marine railways at Kensington. Come to think of it, I haven't"
4268,THE MURDER.,"seen them around for nearly a week, neighbor!"" exclaimed an old man."
4269,THE MURDER.,
4270,THE MURDER.,"""It's a case of drowning, no doubt,"" spoke up a little fellow who did a"
4271,THE MURDER.,"river business in old chains and junk. ""You see they had another"
4272,THE MURDER.,"ship-mending place on the island opposite Kinsington, and rowin'"
4273,THE MURDER.,"theirselves over was upset and never missed!"""
4274,THE MURDER.,
4275,THE MURDER.,"""Quare enough too!"" added a third party, ""for yisterday I had a talk"
4276,THE MURDER.,"with young Andrew Zane, this one's son (touching the body with his"
4277,THE MURDER.,"foot), and Andrew said--a little pale I thought he was--says he, 'Pop's"
4278,THE MURDER.,"_about_.'"""
4279,THE MURDER.,
4280,THE MURDER.,Here a little buzz of mystery--so grateful to crowds which have come far
4281,THE MURDER.,over slippery surface and expect much--undulated to the outward
4282,THE MURDER.,"boundaries. As the people moved the ice cracked like a cannon shot, and"
4283,THE MURDER.,"they dispersed like blackbirds, to rally soon again."
4284,THE MURDER.,
4285,THE MURDER.,"""Here's a doctor! Now we'll know about it! _He's_ here!"" was exclaimed"
4286,THE MURDER.,"by several, as an important little man was pushed along, and the"
4287,THE MURDER.,thickest crowd gave him passage. The little man borrowed a boy's cap to
4288,THE MURDER.,"kneel on, adjusted a sort of microscopic glass to his nose, as if plain"
4289,THE MURDER.,"eyes had no adequate use to this scientific necessity, and he called up"
4290,THE MURDER.,"two volunteers to turn the corpses over, keep back the throng, give him"
4291,THE MURDER.,"light, and add imposition to apprehension. Finally he stopped at a place"
4292,THE MURDER.,"in the garments of the principal of the twain. ""Here is a hole,"" he"
4293,THE MURDER.,"exclaimed, ""with burned woollen fibre about it, as if a pistol had been"
4294,THE MURDER.,fired at close quarters. Draw back this woollen under-jacket! There--as
4295,THE MURDER.,"I expected, gentlemen, is a pistol shot in the breast! What is the name"
4296,THE MURDER.,"of the person? Ah! thank you! Well, William Zane, gentlemen, was shot"
4297,THE MURDER.,"before he was drowned?"""
4298,THE MURDER.,
4299,THE MURDER.,"The great crowd swayed and rushed forward again, and again the ice"
4300,THE MURDER.,cracked like artillery. Before the multitude could swarm to the honey of
4301,THE MURDER.,"a crime a second time, the news was dispersed that both of the drowned"
4302,THE MURDER.,"men had bullet wounds in their bodies, and both had been undoubtedly"
4303,THE MURDER.,murdered. Some supposed it was the work of river pirates; others a
4304,THE MURDER.,"private revenge, perpetrated by some following boat's party in the"
4305,THE MURDER.,darkness of night. But more than one person piped shrilly ere the people
4306,THE MURDER.,wearily scattered in the dusk for their homes on the two shores of the
4307,THE MURDER.,"river: ""How did it happen that young Zane, the old un's son, said"
4308,THE MURDER.,"yisterday that his daddy was about, when he's been frozen in at least"
4309,THE MURDER.,"three days?"""

4316,THE FLIGHT.,THE FLIGHT.
4317,THE FLIGHT.,
4318,THE FLIGHT.,
4319,THE FLIGHT.,A handsome residence on the south side of Queen Street had been the home
4320,THE FLIGHT.,"of the prosperous ship-carpenter, William Zane. His name was on the door"
4321,THE FLIGHT.,"on a silver plate. As the evening deepened and the news spread, the bell"
4322,THE FLIGHT.,"was pulled so often that it aided the universal alarm following a crime,"
4323,THE FLIGHT.,"and a crowd of people, reinforced by others as fast as it thinned out,"
4324,THE FLIGHT.,"kept up the watch on ever-recurring friends, coroner's officers and"
4325,THE FLIGHT.,"newspaper reporters, as they ascended the steps, looked grave, made"
4326,THE FLIGHT.,"inquiries, and returned to dispense their information."
4327,THE FLIGHT.,
4328,THE FLIGHT.,"But there was very little indignation, for Zane had been an insanely"
4329,THE FLIGHT.,"passionate man, rather hard and exacting, and had he been found dead"
4330,THE FLIGHT.,alone anywhere it would probably have been said at once that he brought
4331,THE FLIGHT.,"it on himself. His partner, Rainey, however, had conducted himself so"
4332,THE FLIGHT.,"negatively and mildly, and was of such general estimation, that the"
4333,THE FLIGHT.,murder of the senior member of the film took on some unusual public
4334,THE FLIGHT.,sympathy from the reflected sorrow for his fellow-victim. The latter had
4335,THE FLIGHT.,"been one of Zane's apprentices, raised to a place in the establishment"
4336,THE FLIGHT.,"by his usefulness and sincere love of his patron. Just, forbearing,"
4337,THE FLIGHT.,"soft-spoken, and not avaricious, Sayler Rainey deserved no injury from"
4338,THE FLIGHT.,"any living being. He was unmarried, and, having met with a"
4339,THE FLIGHT.,"disappointment in love, had avowed his intention never to marry, but to"
4340,THE FLIGHT.,"bequeath all the property he should acquire to his partner's only son,"
4341,THE FLIGHT.,Andrew Zane.
4342,THE FLIGHT.,
4343,THE FLIGHT.,"What, then, was the motive of this double murder? The public"
4344,THE FLIGHT.,"comprehension found but one theory, and that was freely advanced by the"
4345,THE FLIGHT.,rash and imputative in the community of Kensington: The murderer was he
4346,THE FLIGHT.,who had the only known temptation and object in such a crime. Who could
4347,THE FLIGHT.,"gain anything by it but Andrew Zane, the impulsive, the mischief-making"
4348,THE FLIGHT.,"and oft-restrained son of his stern sire, who, by a double crime, would"
4349,THE FLIGHT.,"inherit that undivided property, free from the control of both parent"
4350,THE FLIGHT.,and guardian?
4351,THE FLIGHT.,
4352,THE FLIGHT.,"""It is parricide! that's what it is!"" exclaimed a fat woman from"
4353,THE FLIGHT.,"Fishtown. ""At the bottom of the river dead men tell no tales. The"
4354,THE FLIGHT.,"rebellious young sarpint of a son, who allus pulled a lusty oar, has"
4355,THE FLIGHT.,"chased them two older ones into the deep water of the channel, where a"
4356,THE FLIGHT.,"pistol shot can't be heard ashore, and he expected the property to be"
4357,THE FLIGHT.,"his'n. But there are gallowses yet, thank the Lord!"""
4358,THE FLIGHT.,
4359,THE FLIGHT.,"""Mrs. Whann, don't say that,"" spoke up a deferential voice from the face"
4360,THE FLIGHT.,"of a rather sallow-skinned young man, with long, ringleted, yellow hair."
4361,THE FLIGHT.,"""Don't create a prejudice, I beg of you. Andrew Zane was my classmate."
4362,THE FLIGHT.,"He gave his excellent father some trouble, but it shouldn't be"
4363,THE FLIGHT.,"remembered against him now. Suppose, my friends, that you let me ring"
4364,THE FLIGHT.,"the bell and inquire?"""
4365,THE FLIGHT.,
4366,THE FLIGHT.,"""Who's that?"" asked the crowd. ""He's a fine, mature-looking, charitable"
4367,THE FLIGHT.,"young man, anyway."""
4368,THE FLIGHT.,
4369,THE FLIGHT.,"""Its the old Minister Van de Lear's son, Calvin. He's going to succeed"
4370,THE FLIGHT.,"his venerable and pious poppy in Kensington pulpit. They'll let him in."""
4371,THE FLIGHT.,
4372,THE FLIGHT.,The door closed when Calvin Van de Lear entered the residence of the
4373,THE FLIGHT.,late William Zane. When it reopened he was seen with a handkerchief in
4374,THE FLIGHT.,"his hand and his hat pulled down over his eyes, as if he had been"
4375,THE FLIGHT.,weeping.
4376,THE FLIGHT.,
4377,THE FLIGHT.,"""Stop! stop! don't be going off that way!"" interposed the fat fishwife."
4378,THE FLIGHT.,"""You said you would tell us the news."""
4379,THE FLIGHT.,
4380,THE FLIGHT.,"""My friends,"" replied Calvin Van de Lear, with a look of the greatest"
4381,THE FLIGHT.,"pain, ""Andrew Zane has not been heard from. I fear your suspicions are"
4382,THE FLIGHT.,"too true!"""
4383,THE FLIGHT.,
4384,THE FLIGHT.,He crossed the street and disappeared into the low and elderly residence
4385,THE FLIGHT.,of his parents.
4386,THE FLIGHT.,
4387,THE FLIGHT.,"""Alas! alas!"" exclaimed a grave and gentle old man. ""That Andrew Zane"
4388,THE FLIGHT.,should not be here to meet a charge like this! But I'll not believe it
4389,THE FLIGHT.,"till I have prayed with my God."""
4390,THE FLIGHT.,
4391,THE FLIGHT.,Within the Zane residence all was as in other houses on funeral eves. In
4392,THE FLIGHT.,"the front parlor, ready for an inquest or an undertaker, lay the late"
4393,THE FLIGHT.,"master of the place, laid out, and all the visitors departed except his"
4394,THE FLIGHT.,"housekeeper, Agnes, and her friend, ""Podge"" Byerly. The latter was a"
4395,THE FLIGHT.,"sunny-haired and nimble little lady, under twenty years of age, who"
4396,THE FLIGHT.,taught in one of the public schools and boarded with her former
4397,THE FLIGHT.,"school-mate, Agnes Wilt. Agnes was an orphan of unknown parentage, by"
4398,THE FLIGHT.,many supposed to have been a niece or relative of Mr. Zane's deceased
4399,THE FLIGHT.,"wife, whose place she took at the head of the table, and had grown to be"
4400,THE FLIGHT.,one of the principal social authorities in Kensington. In Reverend Mr.
4401,THE FLIGHT.,Van de Lear's church she was both teacher and singer. The young men of
4402,THE FLIGHT.,"Kensington were all in love with her, but it was generally understood"
4403,THE FLIGHT.,"that she had accepted Andrew Zane, and was engaged to him."
4404,THE FLIGHT.,
4405,THE FLIGHT.,"Andrew was not dissipated, but was fond of pranks, and so restive under"
4406,THE FLIGHT.,"his father's positive hand that he twice ran away to distant seaports,"
4407,THE FLIGHT.,"and thus incurred a remarkable amount of intuitive gossip, such as"
4408,THE FLIGHT.,belongs to all old settled suburban societies. This occasional firmness
4409,THE FLIGHT.,"of character in the midst of a generally light and flexible life, now"
4410,THE FLIGHT.,"told against him in the public mind. ""He has nerve enough to do anything"
4411,THE FLIGHT.,"desperate in a pinch,"" exclaimed the very wisest. ""Didn't William Zane"
4412,THE FLIGHT.,find him out once in the island of Barbadoes grubbing sugar-cane with a
4413,THE FLIGHT.,"hoe, and the thermometer at 120 in the shade? And didn't he swear he'd"
4414,THE FLIGHT.,"stay there and die unless concessions were made to him, and certain"
4415,THE FLIGHT.,things never brought up again? Didn't even his iron-shod father have to
4416,THE FLIGHT.,"give way before he would come home? Ah! Andrew is light-hearted, but he"
4417,THE FLIGHT.,"is an Indian in self-will!"""
4418,THE FLIGHT.,
4419,THE FLIGHT.,"To-night Agnes was in the deepest grief. Upon her, and only her, fell"
4420,THE FLIGHT.,"the whole burden of this double crime and mystery, ten times more"
4421,THE FLIGHT.,terrible that her lover was compromised and had disappeared.
4422,THE FLIGHT.,
4423,THE FLIGHT.,"""Go to bed, Podge!"" said Agnes, as the clock in the engine-house struck"
4424,THE FLIGHT.,"midnight. ""Oblige me, my dear! I cannot sleep, and shall wait and watch."
4425,THE FLIGHT.,"Perhaps Andrew will be here."""
4426,THE FLIGHT.,
4427,THE FLIGHT.,"""I can't leave you up, Aggy, and with that thing so near."" She locked"
4428,THE FLIGHT.,"toward the front parlor, where, behind the folding-doors, lay the dead."
4429,THE FLIGHT.,
4430,THE FLIGHT.,"""I have no fear of _that_. He was always kind to me. My fears are all in"
4431,THE FLIGHT.,"this world. O _darling_!"""
4432,THE FLIGHT.,
4433,THE FLIGHT.,"She burst into sobs. Her friend kissed her again and again, and knew"
4434,THE FLIGHT.,that feelings between love and crime extorted that last word.
4435,THE FLIGHT.,
4436,THE FLIGHT.,"""Aggy,"" spoke the light-hearted girl, ""I know that you cannot help"
4437,THE FLIGHT.,"loving him, and as long as he is loved by you I sha'n't believe him"
4438,THE FLIGHT.,"guilty. Must I really leave you here?"""
4439,THE FLIGHT.,
4440,THE FLIGHT.,"Her weeping friend turned up her face to give the mandatory kiss, and"
4441,THE FLIGHT.,Podge was gone.
4442,THE FLIGHT.,
4443,THE FLIGHT.,"Agnes sat in solitude, with her hands folded and her heart filled with"
4444,THE FLIGHT.,"unutterable tender woe, that so much causeless cloud had settled upon"
4445,THE FLIGHT.,the home of her refuge. She could not experience that relief many of us
4446,THE FLIGHT.,"feel in deep adversity, that it is all illusion, and will in a moment"
4447,THE FLIGHT.,"float away like other dreams. Brought to this house an orphan, and twice"
4448,THE FLIGHT.,"deprived of a mother's love, she had only entered woman's estate when"
4449,THE FLIGHT.,another class of cares beset her. Her beauty and sweetness of
4450,THE FLIGHT.,disposition had brought her more lovers than could make her happy. There
4451,THE FLIGHT.,"was but one on whom she could confer her heart, and this natural choice"
4452,THE FLIGHT.,had drawn around her the perils which now overwhelmed them all.
4453,THE FLIGHT.,"Accepting the son, she incurred the father's resentment upon both; for"
4454,THE FLIGHT.,"he, the dead man yonder, had also been her lover."
4455,THE FLIGHT.,
4456,THE FLIGHT.,"""Oh, my God!"" exclaimed the anguished woman, kneeling by her chair and"
4457,THE FLIGHT.,"laying her cheek upon it, while only such tears as we shed in supreme"
4458,THE FLIGHT.,"moments saturated her handkerchief, ""what have I done to make such"
4459,THE FLIGHT.,misery to others? How sinful I must be to set son and father against
4460,THE FLIGHT.,"each other! Yet, Heavenly Father, I can but love!"""
4461,THE FLIGHT.,
4462,THE FLIGHT.,"There was a cracking of something, as if the dead man in the great,"
4463,THE FLIGHT.,black parlor had carried his jealousy beyond his doom and was breaking
4464,THE FLIGHT.,"from his coffin to upbraid her. A door burst open in the dining-room,"
4465,THE FLIGHT.,"which was behind her, and then the dining-room door also unclosed, and"
4466,THE FLIGHT.,"was followed by a cold, graveyard draft. A moment of superstition"
4467,THE FLIGHT.,"possessed Agnes. ""Guard me, Saviour,"" she murmured."
4468,THE FLIGHT.,
4469,THE FLIGHT.,"At the dining-room threshold, advancing a little over the sill, as if to"
4470,THE FLIGHT.,"rush upon her, was the figure of a man, dressed, head to foot, in"
4471,THE FLIGHT.,"sailor's garments--heavy woollens, comforter, tarpaulin overalls, and"
4472,THE FLIGHT.,"knit cap. He looked at her an instant, standing there, shivering, and"
4473,THE FLIGHT.,"then he retired a pace or two and closed the door to the cellar, by"
4474,THE FLIGHT.,which he had entered the house. Even this little movement in the
4475,THE FLIGHT.,"intruder had something familiar about it. He advanced again, directly"
4476,THE FLIGHT.,"and rapidly, toward her, but she did not scream. He threw both arms"
4477,THE FLIGHT.,"around her, and she did not cry. Something had entered with that bold"
4478,THE FLIGHT.,figure which extinguished all crime and superstition in the monarchy of
4479,THE FLIGHT.,its presence--Love.
4480,THE FLIGHT.,
4481,THE FLIGHT.,"A kiss, as fervent and long as only the reunited ever give with purity,"
4482,THE FLIGHT.,drew the soul of the suspected murderer and his sweetheart into one
4483,THE FLIGHT.,temple.
4484,THE FLIGHT.,
4485,THE FLIGHT.,"""Agnes,"" he whispered hoarsely, when it was given, ""they have followed"
4486,THE FLIGHT.,me hard to-night. Every place I might have resorted to is watched. All
4487,THE FLIGHT.,Kensington--my oldest friends--believe me guilty! I cannot face it. With
4488,THE FLIGHT.,"this kiss I must go."""
4489,THE FLIGHT.,
4490,THE FLIGHT.,"""Oh, Andrew, do not! Here is the place to make your peace; here take"
4491,THE FLIGHT.,"your stand and await the worst."""
4492,THE FLIGHT.,
4493,THE FLIGHT.,"""Agnes,"" he repeated, ""I have no defence. Nothing but silence would"
4494,THE FLIGHT.,"defend me now, and that would hang me to the gallows. I come to put my"
4495,THE FLIGHT.,"life and soul into your hands. Can you pray for me, bad as I am?"""
4496,THE FLIGHT.,
4497,THE FLIGHT.,"""Dear Andrew,"" answered Agnes, weeping fast, ""I have no power to stop"
4498,THE FLIGHT.,"you, and I cannot give you up. Yes, I will pray for you now, before you"
4499,THE FLIGHT.,start on your journey. Go open those folding-doors and we will pray in
4500,THE FLIGHT.,"the other room."""
4501,THE FLIGHT.,
4502,THE FLIGHT.,"""What is there?"""
4503,THE FLIGHT.,
4504,THE FLIGHT.,"""Your father."""
4505,THE FLIGHT.,
4506,THE FLIGHT.,"He stopped a long while, and his cheek was blanched."
4507,THE FLIGHT.,
4508,THE FLIGHT.,"""Go first,"" he whispered finally. ""I am not afraid."""
4509,THE FLIGHT.,
4510,THE FLIGHT.,"She led the way to the bier, where the body, with the frost hardly yet"
4511,THE FLIGHT.,"thawed from it, lay under the dim light of the chandelier. Turning up"
4512,THE FLIGHT.,"the burners it was revealed in its relentless, though not unhappy,"
4513,THE FLIGHT.,"expression--a large and powerful man, bearded and with tassels of gray"
4514,THE FLIGHT.,in his hair.
4515,THE FLIGHT.,
4516,THE FLIGHT.,"The young man in his coarse sailor's garb, muffled up for concealment"
4517,THE FLIGHT.,"and disguise, placed his arm around Agnes, and his knees were unsteady"
4518,THE FLIGHT.,as he gazed down on the remains and began to sob.
4519,THE FLIGHT.,
4520,THE FLIGHT.,"""Dear,"" she murmured, also weeping, ""I know you loved him!"""
4521,THE FLIGHT.,
4522,THE FLIGHT.,"The young man's sobs became so loud that Agnes drew him to a chair, and"
4523,THE FLIGHT.,as she sat upon it he laid his head in her lap and continued there to
4524,THE FLIGHT.,express a deep inward agony.
4525,THE FLIGHT.,
4526,THE FLIGHT.,"""I loved him always,"" he articulated at last, ""so help me God, I did!"
4527,THE FLIGHT.,"And a _parricide_! Can you survive it?"""
4528,THE FLIGHT.,
4529,THE FLIGHT.,"""Andrew,"" she replied, ""I have taken it all to heaven and laid the sin"
4530,THE FLIGHT.,"there. Forever, my darling, intercession continues for all our offences"
4531,THE FLIGHT.,only there. It must be our recourse in this separation every day when we
4532,THE FLIGHT.,"rise and lie down. Though blood-stained, he can wash as white as snow."""
4533,THE FLIGHT.,
4534,THE FLIGHT.,"""I will try, I will try!"" he sobbed; ""but your goodness is my reliance,"
4535,THE FLIGHT.,"dearest. I have always been disobedient to my father, but never thought"
4536,THE FLIGHT.,"it would come to this."""
4537,THE FLIGHT.,
4538,THE FLIGHT.,"""Nor I, Andrew. Poor, rash uncle!"""
4539,THE FLIGHT.,
4540,THE FLIGHT.,"""Agnes,"" whispered Andrew Zane, rising with a sudden fear, ""I hear"
4541,THE FLIGHT.,"people about the house--on the pavement, on the doorsteps. Perhaps they"
4542,THE FLIGHT.,are suspecting me. I must fly. Oh! shall we ever meet again under a
4543,THE FLIGHT.,"brighter sky? Will you cling to me? I am going out, abandoned by all the"
4544,THE FLIGHT.,world. Nothing is left me but your fidelity. Will it last? You know you
4545,THE FLIGHT.,"are beautiful!"""
4546,THE FLIGHT.,
4547,THE FLIGHT.,"""Oh, sad words to say!"" sighed Agnes. ""Let none but you ever say them to"
4548,THE FLIGHT.,"me again. Beautiful, and to the end of such misery as this! My only"
4549,THE FLIGHT.,"love, I will never forsake you!"""
4550,THE FLIGHT.,
4551,THE FLIGHT.,"""Then I can try the world again, winter as it is. Once more, oh, God!"
4552,THE FLIGHT.,"let me ask forgiveness from these frozen lips. My father! pursue me not,"
4553,THE FLIGHT.,"though deep is my offence! Farewell, farewell forever!"""
4554,THE FLIGHT.,
4555,THE FLIGHT.,"He disappeared down the cellar as he had come, and Agnes heard at the"
4556,THE FLIGHT.,outer window the sound of his escaping. When all was silent she fell to
4557,THE FLIGHT.,"the floor, and lay there helplessly weeping."

4565,THE DEAF MAN.,
4566,THE DEAF MAN.,
4567,THE DEAF MAN.,"The inquest was held, and the jury pronounced the double crime murder by"
4568,THE DEAF MAN.,"persons unknown, but with strong suspicion resting on Andrew Zane and an"
4569,THE DEAF MAN.,"unknown laborer, who had left Pettit's or Treaty Island, at night, in an"
4570,THE DEAF MAN.,open boat with William Zane and Sayler Rainey. A reward was offered for
4571,THE DEAF MAN.,Andrew Zane and the laborer.
4572,THE DEAF MAN.,
4573,THE DEAF MAN.,The will of the deceased persons made Andrew Zane full legatee of both
4574,THE DEAF MAN.,"estates, and left a life interest in the Queen Street house, and $2000 a"
4575,THE DEAF MAN.,"year to ""Agnes Wilt, my ward and housekeeper."" The executors of the Zane"
4576,THE DEAF MAN.,"estate were named as Agnes Wilt, Rev. Silas Van de Lear, and Duff"
4577,THE DEAF MAN.,Salter. The two dead men were interred together in the old Presbyterian
4578,THE DEAF MAN.,"burial-ground, and after a month or two of diminishing excitement,"
4579,THE DEAF MAN.,Kensington settled down to the idea that there was a great mystery
4580,THE DEAF MAN.,somewhere; that Andrew Zane was probably guilty; but that the principal
4581,THE DEAF MAN.,evidence against him was his own flight.
4582,THE DEAF MAN.,
4583,THE DEAF MAN.,"As to Agnes, there was only one respectable opinion--that she was a"
4584,THE DEAF MAN.,"superb work of nature and triumph of womanhood, notwithstanding romantic"
4585,THE DEAF MAN.,"and possibly awkward circumstances of origin and relation. All men, of"
4586,THE DEAF MAN.,"whatever time of life and for whatsoever reason, admired her--the mean"
4587,THE DEAF MAN.,"and earthy if only for her mould, the morally discerning for her"
4588,THE DEAF MAN.,"beautiful quality that pitied, caressed, encouraged, or elevated all who"
4589,THE DEAF MAN.,came within her sphere.
4590,THE DEAF MAN.,
4591,THE DEAF MAN.,"""Preachers of the Gospel ought to have such wives,"" said the Rev. Silas"
4592,THE DEAF MAN.,"Van de Lear, looking at his son Calvin, ""as Agnes Wilt. She is the most"
4593,THE DEAF MAN.,"handy churchwoman in all my ministration in Kensington, which is now"
4594,THE DEAF MAN.,"forty years. Besides being pious, and virtuous, and humble before God,"
4595,THE DEAF MAN.,"she is very comely to the eye, and possesses a house and an independent"
4596,THE DEAF MAN.,income. A wife like that would naturally help a young minister to get a
4597,THE DEAF MAN.,"higher call."""
4598,THE DEAF MAN.,
4599,THE DEAF MAN.,"Young Calvin, who was expected to succeed his father in the venerable"
4600,THE DEAF MAN.,"church close by, and was studying divinity, said with much cool"
4601,THE DEAF MAN.,maturity:
4602,THE DEAF MAN.,
4603,THE DEAF MAN.,"""Pa, I've taken it all in. She's the only single girl in Kensington"
4604,THE DEAF MAN.,"worth proposing to. It's true that we don't know just who she is, but"
4605,THE DEAF MAN.,"it's not that I'm so much afraid of as her, her--in short, her piety."""
4606,THE DEAF MAN.,
4607,THE DEAF MAN.,"""Piety does not stand in the way of marriage,"" answered the old man, who"
4608,THE DEAF MAN.,"was both bold and prudent, wise and sincere. ""In the covenant of God"
4609,THE DEAF MAN.,nothing is denied to his saints in righteousness. The sense of wedded
4610,THE DEAF MAN.,"pleasure, the beauty that delights the eye, love, appetite, children,"
4611,THE DEAF MAN.,"and financial independence--all are ours, no less as of the Elect than"
4612,THE DEAF MAN.,as worldly creatures. The love of God in the heart warms men and women
4613,THE DEAF MAN.,"toward each other."""
4614,THE DEAF MAN.,
4615,THE DEAF MAN.,"""Oh, as to that!"" exclaimed Calvin, ""I've been warmed toward Miss Agnes"
4616,THE DEAF MAN.,since I was a boy. I think she is superb. But she is a little too good
4617,THE DEAF MAN.,"for me. She looks at me whenever I talk to her, whereas the proper way"
4618,THE DEAF MAN.,of humility would be to look down. She has been in love with Andrew
4619,THE DEAF MAN.,"Zane, you know!"""
4620,THE DEAF MAN.,
4621,THE DEAF MAN.,"""That,"" said the preacher, ""is probably off; though I never discovered"
4622,THE DEAF MAN.,in Andrew more evil than a light heart and occasional rebellion. If she
4623,THE DEAF MAN.,"loves him still, do not be in haste to jar her sensibility. It is"
4624,THE DEAF MAN.,"thoughtfulness which engenders love."""
4625,THE DEAF MAN.,
4626,THE DEAF MAN.,The young women of Kensington were divided about Agnes Wilt. The poorer
4627,THE DEAF MAN.,"girls thought her perfect. But some marriageable and some married women,"
4628,THE DEAF MAN.,"moving in her own sphere of society, criticised her popularity, and said"
4629,THE DEAF MAN.,she must be artful to control so many men. There are no depths to which
4630,THE DEAF MAN.,"jealousy cannot go in a small suburban society. Agnes, as an orphan, had"
4631,THE DEAF MAN.,"felt it since childhood, but nothing had ever happened until now to"
4632,THE DEAF MAN.,concentrate slander as well as sympathy upon her. It was told abroad
4633,THE DEAF MAN.,"that she had been the mistress of her deceased benefactor, who had"
4634,THE DEAF MAN.,fallen by the hands of his infuriated son. Even the police authorities
4635,THE DEAF MAN.,"gave some slight consideration to this view. Old people remarked: ""If"
4636,THE DEAF MAN.,"she has been deceiving people, she will not stop now. She will have"
4637,THE DEAF MAN.,"other secret lovers."""
4638,THE DEAF MAN.,
4639,THE DEAF MAN.,"Inquiries had been made for some time as to who the unknown executor,"
4640,THE DEAF MAN.,"Duff Salter, might be, when one day Rev. Mr. Van de Lear walked over to"
4641,THE DEAF MAN.,"the Zane house with a broad-shouldered, grave, silent-eyed man, who wore"
4642,THE DEAF MAN.,a very long white beard reaching to his middle. As he was also tall and
4643,THE DEAF MAN.,"but little bent, he had that mysterious union of strength and age which"
4644,THE DEAF MAN.,was perfected by his expression of long and absolute silence.
4645,THE DEAF MAN.,
4646,THE DEAF MAN.,"""Agnes,"" said Mr. Van de Lear, ""this is an old Scotch-Irish friend and"
4647,THE DEAF MAN.,"classmate of the late Mr. Zane, Duff Salter of Arkansas. He cannot hear"
4648,THE DEAF MAN.,"what I have said, for he is almost stone deaf. However, go through the"
4649,THE DEAF MAN.,motions of shaking hands. I am told he has heard very little of anything
4650,THE DEAF MAN.,for the past ten years. An explosion in a quicksilver mine broke his
4651,THE DEAF MAN.,"ear-drums."""
4652,THE DEAF MAN.,
4653,THE DEAF MAN.,"Agnes, dressed in deep black, shook hands with the grave stranger"
4654,THE DEAF MAN.,"dutifully, and said:"
4655,THE DEAF MAN.,
4656,THE DEAF MAN.,"""I am sure you are welcome, sir."""
4657,THE DEAF MAN.,
4658,THE DEAF MAN.,"Mr. Salter looked at her closely and gently, and seemed to be pleased"
4659,THE DEAF MAN.,"with the inspection, for he took a small gold box from his pocket,"
4660,THE DEAF MAN.,"unlocked it and sniffed a pinch of snuff, and then gave a sneeze, which"
4661,THE DEAF MAN.,"he articulated, plain as speech, into the words: ""Jericho! Jericho!"""
4662,THE DEAF MAN.,"Then placing the box in the pocket of his long coat, he remarked:"
4663,THE DEAF MAN.,
4664,THE DEAF MAN.,"""Miss Agnes, as one of the executors is a lady, and another is our"
4665,THE DEAF MAN.,"venerable friend here, who has no inclination to attend to the"
4666,THE DEAF MAN.,"settlement of Mr. Zane's estate, it will devolve upon me to examine the"
4667,THE DEAF MAN.,whole subject. I am a stranger in the East. As Mr. Van de Lear may have
4668,THE DEAF MAN.,"told you, I don't hear anything. Will I be welcome as a boarder under"
4669,THE DEAF MAN.,your roof as long as I am looking into my old friend's books and
4670,THE DEAF MAN.,"papers?"""
4671,THE DEAF MAN.,
4672,THE DEAF MAN.,"""Not only welcome, but a protection to us, sir,"" answered Agnes."
4673,THE DEAF MAN.,
4674,THE DEAF MAN.,"He took a set of ivory tablets from his pocket, with a pencil, and"
4675,THE DEAF MAN.,"handing it to her politely, said:"
4676,THE DEAF MAN.,
4677,THE DEAF MAN.,"""Please write your answer."""
4678,THE DEAF MAN.,
4679,THE DEAF MAN.,"She wrote ""Yes."""
4680,THE DEAF MAN.,
4681,THE DEAF MAN.,The deaf lodger gave as little trouble as could have been expected. He
4682,THE DEAF MAN.,"had a bedroom, and moved a large secretary desk into it, and sat there"
4683,THE DEAF MAN.,"all day looking at figures. If he ever wanted to make an inquiry, he"
4684,THE DEAF MAN.,"wrote it on the tablets, and in the evening had it read and answered."
4685,THE DEAF MAN.,"Agnes was a good deal of the time preoccupied, and Podge Byerly, who"
4686,THE DEAF MAN.,"wrote as neatly as copper-plate, answered these inquiries, and conducted"
4687,THE DEAF MAN.,"a little conversation of her own. Podge was a slender blonde, with fine"
4688,THE DEAF MAN.,"blue eyes and a mischievous, sylph-like way of coming and going. Her"
4689,THE DEAF MAN.,freedom of motion and address seemed to concern the stranger. One day
4690,THE DEAF MAN.,"she wrote, after putting down the answer to a business inquiry:"
4691,THE DEAF MAN.,
4692,THE DEAF MAN.,"""Are you married?"""
4693,THE DEAF MAN.,
4694,THE DEAF MAN.,"He hesitated some time and wrote back, ""I hope not."""
4695,THE DEAF MAN.,
4696,THE DEAF MAN.,"She retorted, ""Could one forget if one was married?"""
4697,THE DEAF MAN.,
4698,THE DEAF MAN.,"He replied on the same tablet: ""Not when he tried."""
4699,THE DEAF MAN.,
4700,THE DEAF MAN.,"Podge rubbed it all off, and thought a minute, and then concluded that"
4701,THE DEAF MAN.,evening's correspondence:
4702,THE DEAF MAN.,
4703,THE DEAF MAN.,"""You are an old tease!"""
4704,THE DEAF MAN.,
4705,THE DEAF MAN.,"The next morning, as usual, she wrapped herself up warmly and took the"
4706,THE DEAF MAN.,"omnibus for her school, and saw him watching her out of the upper"
4707,THE DEAF MAN.,"window. That night, instead of any inquiries, he stalked down in his"
4708,THE DEAF MAN.,"worked slippers--the dead man's--and long dressing gown, and, after"
4709,THE DEAF MAN.,"smiling at all, took Podge Byerly's hand and looked at it. This time he"
4710,THE DEAF MAN.,"spoke in a sweet, modulated voice,"
4711,THE DEAF MAN.,
4712,THE DEAF MAN.,"""Very pretty!"""
4713,THE DEAF MAN.,
4714,THE DEAF MAN.,"She was about to reply, when he gave her the ivory tablet, and put his"
4715,THE DEAF MAN.,finger on his lip.
4716,THE DEAF MAN.,
4717,THE DEAF MAN.,"She wrote, ""Did you ever fight a duel?"""
4718,THE DEAF MAN.,
4719,THE DEAF MAN.,"He shook his head ""No."""
4720,THE DEAF MAN.,
4721,THE DEAF MAN.,"She wrote again, ""What else do they do in Arkansas?"""
4722,THE DEAF MAN.,
4723,THE DEAF MAN.,"He replied, ""They love."""
4724,THE DEAF MAN.,
4725,THE DEAF MAN.,"Then Mr. Duff Salter sneezed very loudly, ""Jericho! Jericho! Jericho!"""
4726,THE DEAF MAN.,"Podge ran off at such a serious turn of responses, but was too much of a"
4727,THE DEAF MAN.,woman not to be lured back of her own will. He wrote later in the
4728,THE DEAF MAN.,evening this touching query:
4729,THE DEAF MAN.,
4730,THE DEAF MAN.,"""How do the birds sing now? Are they all dumb?"""
4731,THE DEAF MAN.,
4732,THE DEAF MAN.,"She answered, ""Many can hear who never heard them."""
4733,THE DEAF MAN.,
4734,THE DEAF MAN.,"He wrote again, ""Are you suspicious?"""
4735,THE DEAF MAN.,
4736,THE DEAF MAN.,"She replied, ""_Very_. Are you?"""
4737,THE DEAF MAN.,
4738,THE DEAF MAN.,"He shook his head ""No."""
4739,THE DEAF MAN.,
4740,THE DEAF MAN.,"""I believe he _is_,"" said Podge, turning to Agnes, who had entered. ""He"
4741,THE DEAF MAN.,"looks as if he had asked that question of himself."""
4742,THE DEAF MAN.,
4743,THE DEAF MAN.,"Duff Salter seized his handkerchief and sneezed into it, ""Jericho-o!"
4744,THE DEAF MAN.,"Jericho-wo!"""
4745,THE DEAF MAN.,
4746,THE DEAF MAN.,Podge was sure he was suspicious the next night when she read on his
4747,THE DEAF MAN.,"tablets the rather imputative remark,"
4748,THE DEAF MAN.,
4749,THE DEAF MAN.,"""Is there anything demoralizing in teaching public schools?"""
4750,THE DEAF MAN.,
4751,THE DEAF MAN.,"She replied tartly, ""Yes, stupid old visitors and parents!"""
4752,THE DEAF MAN.,
4753,THE DEAF MAN.,"""Excuse me!"" he wrote; ""I meant politicians."""
4754,THE DEAF MAN.,
4755,THE DEAF MAN.,"She replied in the same spirit as before, ""I think politicians are"
4756,THE DEAF MAN.,"divine!"""
4757,THE DEAF MAN.,
4758,THE DEAF MAN.,Duff Salter looked a little wondering out of those calm gray eyes and
4759,THE DEAF MAN.,"his strong, yet benevolent Scotch-Irish countenance. Podge, who now"
4760,THE DEAF MAN.,"talked freely with Agnes in his presence, said confidently:"
4761,THE DEAF MAN.,
4762,THE DEAF MAN.,"""I believe I can tantalize this good old granny by giving him doubts"
4763,THE DEAF MAN.,"about me! I am real bad, Aggy; you know that! It is no story to tell"
4764,THE DEAF MAN.,"it!"""
4765,THE DEAF MAN.,
4766,THE DEAF MAN.,"""Oh! we are both bad enough to try to improve,"" exclaimed Agnes"
4767,THE DEAF MAN.,absently.
4768,THE DEAF MAN.,
4769,THE DEAF MAN.,"""Jericho! Jericho! Jericho!"" sneezed Duff Salter."
4770,THE DEAF MAN.,
4771,THE DEAF MAN.,"He came down every evening, and began respectfully to bow to Agnes and"
4772,THE DEAF MAN.,"to smile on Podge, and then stretched his feet out to the ottoman, drew"
4773,THE DEAF MAN.,his tablets up to the small table and proceeded to write. They hallooed
4774,THE DEAF MAN.,"into his ear once or twice, but he said he was deaf as a mill-stone, and"
4775,THE DEAF MAN.,might be cursed to his face and wouldn't understand it. They had formed
4776,THE DEAF MAN.,"a pleasing opinion of him, not unmixed with curiosity, when one night he"
4777,THE DEAF MAN.,wrote on the back of a piece of paper:
4778,THE DEAF MAN.,
4779,THE DEAF MAN.,"""Have you any idea who wrote this anonymous note to me?"""
4780,THE DEAF MAN.,
4781,THE DEAF MAN.,Podge Byerly took the note and found in a woman's handwriting these
4782,THE DEAF MAN.,words:
4783,THE DEAF MAN.,
4784,THE DEAF MAN.,"""Mr. Duff Salter, I suppose you know where you are. Your hostesses"
4785,THE DEAF MAN.,"are very insinuating and artful--and what else, _you can find out_!"
4786,THE DEAF MAN.,One man has been murdered in that family; another has disappeared.

4863,A SUITOR.,"""Don't you know,"" she wrote, ""that the propensity to plague a man"
4864,A SUITOR.,"dependent on you is inherent in every healthy woman?"""

4870,A SUITOR.,
4871,A SUITOR.,"As Duff Salter relapsed into silence, gazing on the fire, the voice of"
4872,A SUITOR.,"Calvin Van de Lear was heard by Podge, pitched in a low and confident"

4874,A SUITOR.,
4875,A SUITOR.,"""I called, Agnes, when I thought sufficient time had elapsed since the"

4878,A SUITOR.,
4879,A SUITOR.,"""I am not ready to take more than a necessary part in anything outside"

4882,A SUITOR.,
4883,A SUITOR.,"""Now do be less formal,"" said the young man persuasively. ""I have always"

4895,A SUITOR.,"studying for orders I must be looked up to. Aggy, that's got nothing to"
4896,A SUITOR.,do with social things. When I take the governor's place in our pulpit I
4897,A SUITOR.,"shall make my sermons for this generation altogether crack, sentimental"

4905,A SUITOR.,
4906,A SUITOR.,"Podge saw Agnes put her handkerchief to her face, and her neck shake a"

4909,A SUITOR.,"Podge took a pinch, for fun, and sneezed until the tears came to her"

4930,A SUITOR.,
4931,A SUITOR.,Here Podge ran out of the room and the conversation in the front parlor
4932,A SUITOR.,was renewed. The voice of Calvin Van de Lear said:
4933,A SUITOR.,
4934,A SUITOR.,"""Agnes, looking at your affairs in the light of religious duty, as you"
4935,A SUITOR.,"seem to prefer, I must tell you that your actions have not always been"
4936,A SUITOR.,"perfect."""

4938,A SUITOR.,Nothing was said in reply to this.
4939,A SUITOR.,
4940,A SUITOR.,"""I am to be your pastor at some not distant day,"" spoke the same voice,"
4941,A SUITOR.,"""and may take some of that privilege now. As a daughter of the church"

4943,A SUITOR.,"serious, and approved, and moral young men. Not such scapegraces as"
4944,A SUITOR.,"Andrew Zane!"""
4945,A SUITOR.,
4946,A SUITOR.,"""Sir!"" exclaimed Agnes, rising. ""How dare you speak of the poor absent"
4947,A SUITOR.,"one?"""
4948,A SUITOR.,
4949,A SUITOR.,"""Sit down,"" exclaimed Calvin Van de Lear, not a bit discomposed. ""I have"
4950,A SUITOR.,"some disciplinary power now, and shall have more. A lady in full"
4951,A SUITOR.,communion with our church--a single woman without a living
4952,A SUITOR.,"guardian--requires to hear the truth, even from an erring brother. You"
4953,A SUITOR.,"have no right to go outside the range at least of respectable men, to"
4954,A SUITOR.,place your affections and bestow your beauty and religion on a
4955,A SUITOR.,particularly bad man--a criminal indeed--one already fled from this
4956,A SUITOR.,"community, and under circumstances of the greatest suspicion. I mean"

4958,A SUITOR.,
4959,A SUITOR.,"""Hush!"" exclaimed Agnes; ""perhaps he is dead."""
4960,A SUITOR.,
4961,A SUITOR.,"A short and awkward quiet succeeded, broken by young Van de Lear's"
4962,A SUITOR.,interruption at last:
4963,A SUITOR.,
4964,A SUITOR.,"""Aggy, I don't know but it is the best thing. Is it so?"""
4965,A SUITOR.,
4966,A SUITOR.,"""For shame, sir!"""
4967,A SUITOR.,
4968,A SUITOR.,"""He wouldn't have come to any good. I know him well. We went to school"
4969,A SUITOR.,together here in Kensington. Under a light and agreeable exterior he
4970,A SUITOR.,concealed an obstinacy almost devilish. All the tricks and daredevil
4971,A SUITOR.,"feats we heard of, he was at the head of them. After he grew up his eyes"
4972,A SUITOR.,"fell on you. For a time he was soberer. Then, perceiving that you were"
4973,A SUITOR.,"also his father's choice, he conspired against his father, repeatedly"
4974,A SUITOR.,"absconded, and gave that father great trouble to find and return him to"
4975,A SUITOR.,"his home, and still stepped between Mr. Zane and his wishes. Was that"
4976,A SUITOR.,"the part of a grateful and obedient son?"""
4977,A SUITOR.,
4978,A SUITOR.,Not a word was returned by Agnes Wilt.
4979,A SUITOR.,
4980,A SUITOR.,"""How ill-advised,"" continued Calvin Van de Lear, ""was your weakness"
4981,A SUITOR.,during that behavior! Do you know what the tattle of all Kensington is?
4982,A SUITOR.,That you favored both the father and the son! That you declined the son
4983,A SUITOR.,"only because his father might disinherit him, and put off the father"
4984,A SUITOR.,because the son would have the longer enjoyment of his property! I have
4985,A SUITOR.,"defended you everywhere on these charges. They say even more, _Miss_"
4986,A SUITOR.,Agnes--if you prefer it--that the murder of the father was not committed
4987,A SUITOR.,"by Andrew Zane without an instigator, perhaps an accessory."""
4988,A SUITOR.,
4989,A SUITOR.,The voice of Agnes was heard in hasty and anxious imploration:
4990,A SUITOR.,
4991,A SUITOR.,"""For pity's sake, say no more. Be silent. Am I not bowed and wretched"
4992,A SUITOR.,"enough?"""
4993,A SUITOR.,
4994,A SUITOR.,"She came hastily to the fissure of the door and looked in, because Duff"
4995,A SUITOR.,Salter just then sneezed tremendously:
4996,A SUITOR.,
4997,A SUITOR.,"""Jericho-o-o-o! Jer-ry-cho-o-o!"""
4998,A SUITOR.,
4999,A SUITOR.,Podge Byerly reappeared with a pack of cards and shuffled them before
5000,A SUITOR.,Duff Salter's face.
5001,A SUITOR.,
5002,A SUITOR.,"They sat down and played a game of euchre for a cent a point, the"
5003,A SUITOR.,tablets at hand between them to write whatever was mindful. Duff Salter
5004,A SUITOR.,was the best player.
5005,A SUITOR.,
5006,A SUITOR.,"""I believe,"" wrote Podge, ""that all Western men are gamblers. Are you?"""
5007,A SUITOR.,
5008,A SUITOR.,"He wrote, to her astonishment,"
5009,A SUITOR.,
5010,A SUITOR.,"""I was."""
5011,A SUITOR.,
5012,A SUITOR.,"""Wasn't it a sin?"""
5013,A SUITOR.,
5014,A SUITOR.,"""Not there."""
5015,A SUITOR.,
5016,A SUITOR.,"""I thought gambling was a sin everywhere?"""
5017,A SUITOR.,
5018,A SUITOR.,"""It is everywhere done,"" wrote Duff Salter. ""You are a gambler."""
5019,A SUITOR.,
5020,A SUITOR.,"""That's a fib."""
5021,A SUITOR.,
5022,A SUITOR.,"""You risk your heart, capturing another's."""
5023,A SUITOR.,
5024,A SUITOR.,"""My heart is gone,"" added Podge, blushing."
5025,A SUITOR.,
5026,A SUITOR.,"""What's his name?"" wrote Duff Salter."
5027,A SUITOR.,
5028,A SUITOR.,"""That's telling."""
5029,A SUITOR.,
5030,A SUITOR.,Again the voices of the two people in the front parlor broke on Podge's
5031,A SUITOR.,ear:
5032,A SUITOR.,
5033,A SUITOR.,"""You must leave me, Mr. Van de Lear. You do not know the pain and wrong"
5034,A SUITOR.,"you are doing me."""
5035,A SUITOR.,
5036,A SUITOR.,"""Agnes, I came to say I loved you. Your beauty has almost maddened me"
5037,A SUITOR.,for years. Your resistance would give me anger if I had not hope left. I
5038,A SUITOR.,"know you loved me once."""
5039,A SUITOR.,
5040,A SUITOR.,"""Sir, it is impossible; it is cruel."""
5041,A SUITOR.,
5042,A SUITOR.,"""Cruel to love you?"" repeated the divinity student. ""Come now, that's"
5043,A SUITOR.,absurd! No woman is annoyed by an offer. I swear I love you reverently.
5044,A SUITOR.,I can put you at the head of this society--the wife of a clergyman. Busy
5045,A SUITOR.,"tongues shall be stilled at your coming and going, and the shadow of"
5046,A SUITOR.,"this late tragedy will no more plague your reputation, protected in the"
5047,A SUITOR.,"bosom of the church and nestled in mine."""
5048,A SUITOR.,
5049,A SUITOR.,"Sounds of a slight struggle were heard, as if the amorous young priest"
5050,A SUITOR.,were trying to embrace Agnes.
5051,A SUITOR.,
5052,A SUITOR.,"Podge arose, listening."
5053,A SUITOR.,
5054,A SUITOR.,"The face of Duff Salter was stolid, and unconscious of anything but the"
5055,A SUITOR.,game of cards.
5056,A SUITOR.,
5057,A SUITOR.,"""I tell you, sir!"" exclaimed Agnes, ""that your attentions are offensive."
5058,A SUITOR.,"Will you force me to insult you?"""
5059,A SUITOR.,
5060,A SUITOR.,"""Oh! that's all put on, my subtle beauty. You are not alarmed by these"
5061,A SUITOR.,"delicate endearments. Give me a kiss!"""
5062,A SUITOR.,
5063,A SUITOR.,"""Calvin Van de Lear, you are a hypocrite. The gentleman you have"
5064,A SUITOR.,"slandered to win my favor is as dear to me as you are repulsive. Nay,"
5065,A SUITOR.,"sir, I'll teach you good behavior!"""
5066,A SUITOR.,
5067,A SUITOR.,She threw open the folding-doors just as Duff Salter had come to a
5068,A SUITOR.,terrific sneeze.
5069,A SUITOR.,
5070,A SUITOR.,"""Jericho! Jericho! Jer-rick-co-o-o-oh!"""
5071,A SUITOR.,
5072,A SUITOR.,"Looking in with bold suavity, Calvin Van de Lear made a bow and took up"
5073,A SUITOR.,his hat.
5074,A SUITOR.,
5075,A SUITOR.,"""Good-night,"" he said, ""most reputable ladies, two of a kind!"""
5076,A SUITOR.,
5077,A SUITOR.,"""I think,"" wrote Duff Salter frigidly, as the young man slammed the door"
5078,A SUITOR.,"behind him, ""that we'll make a pitcher of port sangaree and have a"
5079,A SUITOR.,little glass before we go to bed. We will all three take a hand at
5080,A SUITOR.,"cards. What shall we play?"""
5081,A SUITOR.,
5082,A SUITOR.,"""Euchre--cut-throat!"" exclaimed Podge Byerly, rather explosively."
5083,A SUITOR.,
5084,A SUITOR.,"Duff Salter seemed to have heard this, for, with his grave eyes bent on"
5085,A SUITOR.,"Agnes, he echoed, dubiously:"
5086,A SUITOR.,
5087,A SUITOR.,"""Cut-throat!"""
5088,A SUITOR.,
5089,A SUITOR.,"With an impatient motion Podge Byerly snatched at the cards, and they"
5090,A SUITOR.,fell to the floor.
5091,A SUITOR.,
5092,A SUITOR.,Agnes burst into tears and left the room.
5093,A SUITOR.,
5094,A SUITOR.,"""Upon my word,"" thought Podge Byerly, ""I believe this old gray rat is a"
5095,A SUITOR.,"detective officer!"""
5096,A SUITOR.,
5097,A SUITOR.,There was a shadow over the best residence on Queen Street.
5098,A SUITOR.,
5099,A SUITOR.,"Anonymous letters continued to come in almost by every mail, making"
5100,A SUITOR.,"charges and imputations upon Agnes, and frequently connecting Podge"
5101,A SUITOR.,Byerly with her.
5102,A SUITOR.,
5103,A SUITOR.,"Terrible epithets--such as ""Murderess!"" ""A second Mrs. Chapman!"""
5104,A SUITOR.,"""Jezebel,"" etc.--were employed in these letters."
5105,A SUITOR.,
5106,A SUITOR.,Many of them were written by female hands or in very delicate male
5107,A SUITOR.,"chirography, as if men who wrote like women had their natures."
5108,A SUITOR.,
5109,A SUITOR.,"There was one woman's handwriting the girls learned to identify, and she"
5110,A SUITOR.,"wrote more often than any--more beautifully in the writing, more"
5111,A SUITOR.,"shameless in the meaning, as if, with the nethermost experience in"
5112,A SUITOR.,"sensuality, she was prepared to subtleize it and be the universal"
5113,A SUITOR.,accuser of her sex.
5114,A SUITOR.,
5115,A SUITOR.,"""What fiends must surround us!"" exclaimed Agnes. ""There must be a"
5116,A SUITOR.,punishment deeper than any for the writers of anonymous letters. A
5117,A SUITOR.,murderer strikes the vital spot but once. Here every commandment is
5118,A SUITOR.,"broken in the cowardly secret letter. False witness, the stab, illicit"
5119,A SUITOR.,"joy, covetousness, dishonor of father and mother, and defamation of"
5120,A SUITOR.,"God's image in the heart, are all committed in these loathsome letters."""
5121,A SUITOR.,
5122,A SUITOR.,"""Yes,"" added Podge Byerly, ""the woman who writes anonymous letters, I"
5123,A SUITOR.,"think, will have a cancer, or wart on her eye, or marry a bow-legged"
5124,A SUITOR.,"man. The resurrectionists will get her body, and the primary class in"
5125,A SUITOR.,"the other world will play whip-top with the rest of her."""
5126,A SUITOR.,
5127,A SUITOR.,Agnes and Podge went to church prayer-meeting the night following Calvin
5128,A SUITOR.,"Van de Lear's repulse at their dwelling, and Mr. Duff Salter gave each"
5129,A SUITOR.,of them an arm.
5130,A SUITOR.,
5131,A SUITOR.,"Old Mr. Van de Lear led the exercises, and, after several persons had"
5132,A SUITOR.,"publicly prayed by the direction of the venerable pastor, Calvin Van de"
5133,A SUITOR.,"Lear, of his own motion and as a matter of course, took the floor and"
5134,A SUITOR.,launched into a florid supplication almost too elegant to be extempore.
5135,A SUITOR.,
5136,A SUITOR.,"As he continued, Podge Byerly, looking through her fingers, saw a"
5137,A SUITOR.,"handsome, high-colored woman at Calvin's side, stealing glances at Agnes"
5138,A SUITOR.,Wilt.
5139,A SUITOR.,
5140,A SUITOR.,"It was the wife of Calvin Van de Lear's brother, Knox--a blonde of"
5141,A SUITOR.,"large, innocent eyes, who usually came with Calvin to the church."
5142,A SUITOR.,
5143,A SUITOR.,"While Podge noticed this inquisitive or stray glance, she became"
5144,A SUITOR.,conscious that something in the prayer was directing the attention of
5145,A SUITOR.,the whole meeting to their pew.
5146,A SUITOR.,
5147,A SUITOR.,"People turned about, and, with startled or bold looks, observed Agnes"
5148,A SUITOR.,"Wilt, whose head was bowed and her veil down."
5149,A SUITOR.,
5150,A SUITOR.,The voice of Calvin Van de Lear sounded high and meaningful as Podge
5151,A SUITOR.,caught these sentences:
5152,A SUITOR.,
5153,A SUITOR.,"""Lord, smite the wicked and unjust as thou smotest Sapphira by the side"
5154,A SUITOR.,"of Ananias. We find her now in the mask of beauty, again of humility,"
5155,A SUITOR.,"even, O Lord, of religion, leading the souls of men down to death and"
5156,A SUITOR.,hell. Thou knowest who stand before Thee to do lip service. All hearts
5157,A SUITOR.,are open to Thee. If there be any here who have deceived Thine elect by
5158,A SUITOR.,"covetousness, or adultery, or _murder_, Lord, make bare Thine arm!"""
5159,A SUITOR.,
5160,A SUITOR.,The rest of the sentence was lost in the terrific series of sneezes from
5161,A SUITOR.,"Duff Salter, who had taken too big a pinch of snuff and forgot himself,"
5162,A SUITOR.,so as to nearly lift the roof off the little old brick church with his
5163,A SUITOR.,"deeply accentuated,"
5164,A SUITOR.,
5165,A SUITOR.,"""Jer-i-cho-whoe!"""
5166,A SUITOR.,
5167,A SUITOR.,"Even old Silas Van de Lear looked over the top of the pulpit and smiled,"
5168,A SUITOR.,"but, luckily, Duff Salter could hardly hear his own sneezes."
5169,A SUITOR.,
5170,A SUITOR.,"As they left the church Agnes put down her veil, and trembled under the"
5171,A SUITOR.,stare of a hundred investigating critics.
5172,A SUITOR.,
5173,A SUITOR.,"When they were in the street, Podge Byerly remarked:"
5174,A SUITOR.,

5179,A SUITOR.,
5180,A SUITOR.,"""They are driving me to the last point,"" said Agnes. ""I can go to church"

5193,THE GHOST.,"their appointments on the boughs of willows, ailanthuses, lindens, and"
5194,THE GHOST.,maples. Some peach-trees in the back yard of the Zane House hastened to
5195,THE GHOST.,"put on their pink scarves and bonnets, and the boys said that an old"
5196,THE GHOST.,sucker of Penn's Treaty Elm down in a ship-yard was fresh and blithsome
5197,THE GHOST.,"as a second wife. In the hearts and views of living people, too, spring"
5198,THE GHOST.,brought a budding of youthfulness and a gush of sap. Duff Salter
5199,THE GHOST.,acknowledged it as he looked in Podge Byerly's blue eyes and felt her
5200,THE GHOST.,"hands as they wrapped his scarf around him, or buttoned his gloves."
5201,THE GHOST.,"Whispering, and without the tablets this time, he articulated:"

5207,THE GHOST.,
5208,THE GHOST.,"Duff Salter frequently walked almost to her school with Podge Byerly,"
5209,THE GHOST.,which was far down in the old city. They seldom took the general cut
5210,THE GHOST.,"through Maiden and Laurel Streets to Second, but kept down the river"
5211,THE GHOST.,"bank by Beach Street, to see the ship-yards and hear the pounding of"
5212,THE GHOST.,"rivets and the merry adzes ringing, and see youngsters and old women"
5213,THE GHOST.,"gathering chips, while the sails on the broad river came up on wind and"

5215,THE GHOST.,
5216,THE GHOST.,In the afternoons Duff Salter sometimes called on Rev. Silas Van de
5217,THE GHOST.,"Lear, who had great expectations that Duff would build them a"

5219,THE GHOST.,
5220,THE GHOST.,"""Here, Brother Salter, is an historic spot,"" wrote the good old man. ""I"
5221,THE GHOST.,"shouldn't object to a spire on my church, with the figure of William"
5222,THE GHOST.,Penn on the summit. Friend William and his sons always did well by our
5223,THE GHOST.,"sect."""
5224,THE GHOST.,
5225,THE GHOST.,"""Is it an established fact that he treated with the Indians in"
5226,THE GHOST.,"Kensington?"" asked Duff Salter, on his ivory tablets."
5227,THE GHOST.,
5228,THE GHOST.,"""Indisputable! Friend Penn took Thomas Fairman's house at"
5229,THE GHOST.,"Shackamaxon--otherwise Eel-Hole--and in this pleasant springtime, April"
5230,THE GHOST.,"4, 1683, he met King Tammany under the forest elm, with the savage"
5231,THE GHOST.,"people in half-moon circles, looking at the healthy-fed and"
5232,THE GHOST.,business-like Quaker. There Tammany and his Indian allies surrendered
5233,THE GHOST.,"all the land between the Pennypack and Neshaminy."""
5234,THE GHOST.,
5235,THE GHOST.,"""A Tammany haul!"" interrupted young Calvin Van de Lear, rather"
5236,THE GHOST.,"idiotically. ""What did the shrewd William give?"""
5237,THE GHOST.,
5238,THE GHOST.,"""Guns, scissors, knives, tongs, hoes, and Indian money, and"
5239,THE GHOST.,"gew-gaws--not much. Philadelphia had no foundation then, and Shackamaxon"
5240,THE GHOST.,was an established place. We are the Knickerbockers here in
5241,THE GHOST.,"Kensington."""
5242,THE GHOST.,
5243,THE GHOST.,"""An honest Quaker would not build a spire,"" wrote Duff Salter, with a"
5244,THE GHOST.,grim smile.
5245,THE GHOST.,
5246,THE GHOST.,Duff Salter was well known to the gossips of Kensington as a fabulously
5247,THE GHOST.,"rich man, who had spent his youth partly in this district, and was of"
5248,THE GHOST.,"Kensington parentage, but had roved away to Mexico as a sailor boy, or"
5249,THE GHOST.,"clerk, or passenger, and refusing to return, had become a mule-driver in"
5250,THE GHOST.,"the mines of cinnabar, and there had remained for years in nearly"
5251,THE GHOST.,"heathen solitude, until once he arrived overland in Arkansas with a"
5252,THE GHOST.,"train from Chihuahua, the whole of it, as was said, laden with silver"
5253,THE GHOST.,"treasure, and his own property. He had been disappointed in love, and"
5254,THE GHOST.,had no one to leave his riches to. This was the story told by Reverend
5255,THE GHOST.,Silas Van de Lear.
5256,THE GHOST.,
5257,THE GHOST.,The people of Kensington were less concerned with the truth of this tale
5258,THE GHOST.,than with the future intentions of the visitor.
5259,THE GHOST.,
5260,THE GHOST.,"""How long he tarries in Zane's homestead!"" said the people that spring."
5261,THE GHOST.,"""Hasn't he settled that estate yet?"""
5262,THE GHOST.,
5263,THE GHOST.,"""It never will be settled if he can help it,"" said public Echo, ""as long"
5264,THE GHOST.,"as there are two fine young women there, and one of them so fascinating"
5265,THE GHOST.,"over men!"""
5266,THE GHOST.,
5267,THE GHOST.,"Indeed, Duff Salter received letters, anonymous, of course--the"
5268,THE GHOST.,anonymous letter was then the suburban press--admonishing him to beware
5269,THE GHOST.,of his siren hostess.
5270,THE GHOST.,
5271,THE GHOST.,"""_She has ruined two men_,"" said the elegant female handwriting before"
5272,THE GHOST.,"observed. ""_You must want to be the subject of a coroner's inquest. That"
5273,THE GHOST.,"house is bloody and haunted, rich Mr. Duff Salter! Beware of Lady"
5274,THE GHOST.,"Agnes, the murderess! Beware, too, of her accomplice, the insinuating"
5275,THE GHOST.,"little Byerly!_"""
5276,THE GHOST.,
5277,THE GHOST.,Duff Salter walked out one day to make the tour of Kensington. He passed
5278,THE GHOST.,"out the agreeable old Frankford road, with its wayside taverns, and hay"
5279,THE GHOST.,"carts, and passing omnibuses, and occasional old farm-like houses,"
5280,THE GHOST.,"interspersed with newer residences of a city character, and he strolled"
5281,THE GHOST.,far up Cohocksink Creek till it meandered through billowy fields of
5282,THE GHOST.,"green, and skirted the edges of woods, and all the way was followed by a"
5283,THE GHOST.,path made by truant boys. Sitting down by a spring that gushed up at the
5284,THE GHOST.,"foot of a great sycamore tree, the grandly bearded traveller, all"
5285,THE GHOST.,"flushed with the roses of exercise, made no unpleasing picture of a Pan"
5286,THE GHOST.,"waiting for Echo by appointment, or holding talk with the grazing goats"
5287,THE GHOST.,of the poor on the open fields around him.
5288,THE GHOST.,
5289,THE GHOST.,"""How changed!"" spoke the traveller aloud. ""I have caught fishes all"
5290,THE GHOST.,"along this brook, and waded up its bed in summer to cool my feet. The"
5291,THE GHOST.,girl was beside me whose slender feet in innocent exposure were placed
5292,THE GHOST.,"by mine to shame their coarser mould. We thought we were in love, or as"
5293,THE GHOST.,near it as are the outskirts to some throbbing town partly instinctive
5294,THE GHOST.,with a coming civic destiny. Alas! the little brook that once ran
5295,THE GHOST.,"unvexed to the river, freshening green marshes at its outlet, has become"
5296,THE GHOST.,"a sewer, discolored with dyes of factories, and closed around by"
5297,THE GHOST.,"tenements and hovels till its purer life is over. My playmate, too,"
5298,THE GHOST.,"flowed on to womanhood, till the denser social conditions shut her in;"
5299,THE GHOST.,"she mingled the pure current of her life with another more turgid, and"
5300,THE GHOST.,"dull-eyed children, like houses of the suburbs, are builded on her"
5301,THE GHOST.,"bosom. I am alone, like this old tree, beside the spring where once I"
5302,THE GHOST.,"was a sapling, and still, like its waters, youth wells and wells, and"
5303,THE GHOST.,"keeps us yet both green in root. Come back, O Love! and freshen me, and,"
5304,THE GHOST.,"like a rill, flow down my closing years!"""
5305,THE GHOST.,
5306,THE GHOST.,"Duff Salter's shoulder was touched as he ceased to speak, and he found"
5307,THE GHOST.,young Calvin Van de Lear behind him.
5308,THE GHOST.,
5309,THE GHOST.,"""I have followed you out to the country,"" said the young man, howling in"
5310,THE GHOST.,"the elder's ear, ""because I wanted to talk to you aloud, as I couldn't"
5311,THE GHOST.,"do in Kensington."""
5312,THE GHOST.,
5313,THE GHOST.,"Duff Salter drew his storied ivory tablets on the divinity student, and"
5314,THE GHOST.,"said, crisply, ""Write!"""
5315,THE GHOST.,
5316,THE GHOST.,"""No, old man, that's not my style. It's too slow. Besides, it admits of"
5317,THE GHOST.,"nothing impressive being said, and I want to convince you."""
5318,THE GHOST.,
5319,THE GHOST.,"""Jericho! Jericho!"" sneezed Duff Salter. ""Young man, if you stun my ear"
5320,THE GHOST.,"that way a third time I'll knock you down. I'm deaf, it's true, but I'm"
5321,THE GHOST.,"not a hallooing scale to try your lungs on. If you won't write, we can't"
5322,THE GHOST.,"talk."""
5323,THE GHOST.,
5324,THE GHOST.,"With impatience, yet smiling, Calvin Van de Lear wrote on the tablets,"
5325,THE GHOST.,
5326,THE GHOST.,"""Have you seen the ghost?"""
5327,THE GHOST.,
5328,THE GHOST.,"""Ghost?"""
5329,THE GHOST.,
5330,THE GHOST.,"""Yes, the ghosts of the murdered men!"""
5331,THE GHOST.,
5332,THE GHOST.,"""I never saw a ghost of anything in my life. What men?"""
5333,THE GHOST.,
5334,THE GHOST.,"""William Zane and Sayler Rainey."""
5335,THE GHOST.,
5336,THE GHOST.,"""Who has seen them?"""
5337,THE GHOST.,
5338,THE GHOST.,"""Several people. Some say it's but one that has been seen. Zane's ghost"
5339,THE GHOST.,"walks, anyway, in Kensington."""
5340,THE GHOST.,
5341,THE GHOST.,"""What for?"""
5342,THE GHOST.,
5343,THE GHOST.,"""The fishwomen and other superstitious people say, because their"
5344,THE GHOST.,"murderers have not been punished."""
5345,THE GHOST.,
5346,THE GHOST.,"""And the murderers are--"""
5347,THE GHOST.,
5348,THE GHOST.,"""Those who survived and profited by the murder, of course?"""
5349,THE GHOST.,
5350,THE GHOST.,"""Jer-ri-choo-woo!"" exploded Duff Salter. ""Young man,"" he wrote"
5351,THE GHOST.,"deliberately, ""you have an idle tongue."""
5352,THE GHOST.,
5353,THE GHOST.,"""Friend Salter, you are blind as well as deaf. Do you know Miss Podge"
5354,THE GHOST.,"Byerly?"""
5355,THE GHOST.,
5356,THE GHOST.,"""No. Do you?"""
5357,THE GHOST.,
5358,THE GHOST.,"""She's common! Agnes Wilt uses her as a stool-pigeon. She fetches, and"
5359,THE GHOST.,"carries, and flies by night. One of the school directors shoved her on"
5360,THE GHOST.,the public schools for intimate considerations. Perhaps you'll see him
5361,THE GHOST.,"about the house if you look sharp and late some night."""
5362,THE GHOST.,
5363,THE GHOST.,"""Jer-rich-co! Jericho!"""
5364,THE GHOST.,
5365,THE GHOST.,"Duff Salter was decidedly red in the face, and his grave gray eyes"
5366,THE GHOST.,looked both fierce and convicted. He _had_ seen a school director
5367,THE GHOST.,"visiting the house, but thought it natural enough that he should take a"
5368,THE GHOST.,kind interest in one of the youthful and pretty teachers. The deaf man
5369,THE GHOST.,returned to his pencil and tablets.
5370,THE GHOST.,
5371,THE GHOST.,"""Do you know, Mr. Van de Lear, that what you are saying is indictable"
5372,THE GHOST.,"language? It would have exposed you to death where I have lived."""
5373,THE GHOST.,
5374,THE GHOST.,The young man tossed his head recklessly. Duff Salter now saw that his
5375,THE GHOST.,usually sallow face was flushed up to the roots of his long dry hair and
5376,THE GHOST.,"almost colorless whiskers, as if he had been drinking liquors."
5377,THE GHOST.,"Forgetting to use the tablets, Calvin spoke aloud, but not in as high a"
5378,THE GHOST.,key as formerly:
5379,THE GHOST.,
5380,THE GHOST.,"""Mr. Salter, Agnes Wilt has no heart. She was a step-niece of the late"
5381,THE GHOST.,Mrs. Zane--her brother's daughter. The girl's father was a poor
5382,THE GHOST.,"professional man, and died soon after his child was born, followed at no"
5383,THE GHOST.,"great distance to the grave by his widow. While a child, Agnes was cold"
5384,THE GHOST.,and subtle. She professed to love me--that was the understanding in our
5385,THE GHOST.,childhood. She has forgotten me as she has forgotten many other men. But
5386,THE GHOST.,"she is beautiful, and I want to marry her. You can help me."""
5387,THE GHOST.,
5388,THE GHOST.,"""What do you want with a cold and calculating woman?"" wrote Duff Salter"
5389,THE GHOST.,"stiffly. ""What do you want particularly with such a dangerous woman--a"
5390,THE GHOST.,"demon, as you indicate?"""
5391,THE GHOST.,
5392,THE GHOST.,"""I want to save her soul, and retrieve her from wickedness. Upon my"
5393,THE GHOST.,"word, old man, that's my only game. You see, to effect that object would"
5394,THE GHOST.,set me up at once with the church people. I'm told that a little
5395,THE GHOST.,objection to my prospects in the governor's church begins to break out.
5396,THE GHOST.,"If I can marry Agnes Wilt, she will recover her position in Kensington,"
5397,THE GHOST.,and make me more welcome in families. I don't mind telling you that I
5398,THE GHOST.,"have been a little gay."""
5399,THE GHOST.,
5400,THE GHOST.,"""That's nothing,"" wrote Duff Salter smilingly. ""So were the sons of"
5401,THE GHOST.,"Eli."""
5402,THE GHOST.,
5403,THE GHOST.,"""Correct!"" retorted Calvin. ""I need a taming down, and only matrimony"
5404,THE GHOST.,"can do it. Now, with your aid I can manage it. Miss Wilt does not fancy"
5405,THE GHOST.,"me. She can be made to do so, however, by two causes."""
5406,THE GHOST.,
5407,THE GHOST.,"""And they are--"""
5408,THE GHOST.,
5409,THE GHOST.,"""Her fears and her avarice. I propose to bring this murder close home to"
5410,THE GHOST.,"her. If not a principal in it, she is an undoubted accessory after the"
5411,THE GHOST.,fact. Andrew Zane paid her a visit the night the dead bodies were
5412,THE GHOST.,"discovered in the river."""
5413,THE GHOST.,
5414,THE GHOST.,"""You are sure of this?"""
5415,THE GHOST.,
5416,THE GHOST.,"""Perfectly. I have had a detective on his track; too late to arrest the"
5417,THE GHOST.,"rascal, but the identity of a sailor man who penetrated into the house"
5418,THE GHOST.,by the coal-hole is established by the discovery of the clothing he
5419,THE GHOST.,exchanged for that disguise--it was Andrew Zane. Concealment of that
5420,THE GHOST.,"fact from the law will make her an accessory."""
5421,THE GHOST.,
5422,THE GHOST.,"""Jericho! Jericho!"" sneezed Duff Salter, but with a pale face, and said:"
5423,THE GHOST.,
5424,THE GHOST.,"""That fact established would be serious; but it would be a gratuitous"
5425,THE GHOST.,"and vile act for you, who profess to love her."""
5426,THE GHOST.,
5427,THE GHOST.,"""It is love that prompts me--love and pain! A divine anger, I may call"
5428,THE GHOST.,"it. I propose to make myself her rescuer afterward, and establish myself"
5429,THE GHOST.,in her gratitude and confidence. You are to help me do this by watching
5430,THE GHOST.,"the house from the inside."""
5431,THE GHOST.,
5432,THE GHOST.,"""Dishonorable!"""
5433,THE GHOST.,
5434,THE GHOST.,"""You were the friend of William Zane, the murdered man. Every obligation"
5435,THE GHOST.,of friendship impels you to discover his murderer. You are rich; lend me
5436,THE GHOST.,money to continue my investigations. I know this is a cool proposition;
5437,THE GHOST.,"but it is better than spending it on churches."""
5438,THE GHOST.,
5439,THE GHOST.,"""Very well,"" wrote Duff Salter, ""as the late Mr. Zane's executor, I will"
5440,THE GHOST.,spend any proper sum of money to inflict retribution upon his injurers.
5441,THE GHOST.,"I will watch the house."""
5442,THE GHOST.,
5443,THE GHOST.,"They went home through Palmer Street, on which stood the little brick"
5444,THE GHOST.,church--the street said to be occasionally haunted by Governor Anthony
5445,THE GHOST.,"Palmer's phantom coach and four, which was pursued by his twenty-one"
5446,THE GHOST.,"children in plush breeches and Panama hats, crying, ""Water lots! water"
5447,THE GHOST.,"fronts! To let! to lease!"""
5448,THE GHOST.,
5449,THE GHOST.,As Duff Salter entered the house he saw the school director indicated by
5450,THE GHOST.,Calvin Van de Lear sitting in the parlor with Podge Byerly. For the
5451,THE GHOST.,first time Duff Salter noticed that they looked both intimate and
5452,THE GHOST.,"confused. He tried to reason himself out of this suspicion. ""Pshaw,"" he"
5453,THE GHOST.,"said; ""it was my uncharitable imagination. I'll go back, as if to get"
5454,THE GHOST.,"something, and look more carefully."""
5455,THE GHOST.,
5456,THE GHOST.,As the deaf man reopened the parlor-door he saw the school director
5457,THE GHOST.,"making a motion as if to embrace Podge, who was full of blushes and"
5458,THE GHOST.,appearing to shrink away.
5459,THE GHOST.,
5460,THE GHOST.,"""There's no imagination about that,"" thought Duff Salter. ""If I could"
5461,THE GHOST.,"only hear well enough my ears might counsel me."""
5462,THE GHOST.,
5463,THE GHOST.,"He felt dejected, and his suspicions colored everything--a most"
5464,THE GHOST.,"deplorable state of mind for a gentleman. Agnes, too, looked guilty, as"
5465,THE GHOST.,"he thought, and hardly addressed a smile to him as he passed up to his"
5466,THE GHOST.,room.
5467,THE GHOST.,
5468,THE GHOST.,"Duff Salter put on his slippers, lighted his gas, drew the curtains down"
5469,THE GHOST.,"and set the door ajar, for in the increasing warmth of spring his grate"
5470,THE GHOST.,fire was almost an infliction.
5471,THE GHOST.,
5472,THE GHOST.,"""I have not been wise nor just,"" he said to himself. ""My pleasing"
5473,THE GHOST.,"reception in this house, and feminine arts, have altogether obliterated"
5474,THE GHOST.,"my great duty, which was to avenge my friend. Yes, suspicion was my"
5475,THE GHOST.,duty. I should have been suspicious from the first. Even this vicious
5476,THE GHOST.,"young Van de Lear, shallow as he is, becomes my unconscious accuser. He"
5477,THE GHOST.,"says, with truth, that every obligation of friendship impels me to"
5478,THE GHOST.,"discover the murderers of William Zane."""
5479,THE GHOST.,
5480,THE GHOST.,"Duff Salter arose, in the warmth of his feelings, and paced up and down"
5481,THE GHOST.,the floor.
5482,THE GHOST.,
5483,THE GHOST.,"""Ah, William Zane,"" he said, ""how does thy image come back to me! I was"
5484,THE GHOST.,the only friend he would permit. In pride of will and solitary purpose
5485,THE GHOST.,"he was the greatest of all. Rough, unpolished, a poor scholar, but full"
5486,THE GHOST.,"of energy, he desired nothing but he believed it his. He desired me to"
5487,THE GHOST.,"be his friend, and I could not have resisted if I would. He made me go"
5488,THE GHOST.,"with him even on his truant expeditions, and carry his game bag along"
5489,THE GHOST.,"the banks of the Tacony, or up the marshes of Rancocus. Yet it was a"
5490,THE GHOST.,happy servitude; for beneath his impetuous mastery was a soul of
5491,THE GHOST.,"devotion. He loved like Jove, and permitted no interposition in his"
5492,THE GHOST.,"flame; his dogmatism and force were barbarous, but he gave like a child"
5493,THE GHOST.,and fought like a lion. I saw him last as he was about to enter on
5494,THE GHOST.,"business, in the twenty-first year of his age, an anxious young man with"
5495,THE GHOST.,"black hair in natural ringlets, a pale brow, gray eyes wide apart, and"
5496,THE GHOST.,"a narrow but wilful chin. He was ever on pivot, ready to spring. And"
5497,THE GHOST.,"murdered!"""
5498,THE GHOST.,
5499,THE GHOST.,"Duff Salter looked at the door standing ajar, attracted there by some"
5500,THE GHOST.,"movement, or light, or shadow, and the very image he was describing met"
5501,THE GHOST.,"his gaze. There were the black ringlets, the pale forehead, the anxious"
5502,THE GHOST.,"yet wilful expression, and the years of youthful manhood. It was nothing"
5503,THE GHOST.,in this world if not William Zane!
5504,THE GHOST.,
5505,THE GHOST.,"Duff Salter felt paralyzed for a minute, as the blood flowed back to his"
5506,THE GHOST.,"heart, and a sense of fright overcame him. Then he moved forward on"
5507,THE GHOST.,"tip-toe, as if the image might dissolve. It did dissolve as he advanced;"
5508,THE GHOST.,with a tripping motion it receded and left a naked space. In the
5509,THE GHOST.,"darkness of the stairway it absorbed itself, and the deaf man grasped"
5510,THE GHOST.,"the balustrade where it had stood, and by his trembling shook the rails"
5511,THE GHOST.,"violently. He then staggered back to his mantel, first bolting the door,"
5512,THE GHOST.,"as if instinctively, and swallowed a draught of brandy from a medicinal"
5513,THE GHOST.,bottle there.
5514,THE GHOST.,
5515,THE GHOST.,"""There is a ghost abroad!"" exclaimed Duff Salter with a shudder. ""I have"
5516,THE GHOST.,"seen it."""
5517,THE GHOST.,
5518,THE GHOST.,"He turned the gas on very brightly, so as to soothe his fears with"
5519,THE GHOST.,"companionable light. Then, while the perspiration stood upon his"
5520,THE GHOST.,"forehead, Duff Salter sat down to think."
5521,THE GHOST.,
5522,THE GHOST.,"""Why does it haunt me?"" he said. ""Yet whom but me should it haunt?--the"
5523,THE GHOST.,"executor of my friend, intrusted with his dying wishes, bound to him by"
5524,THE GHOST.,"ancient ties, and recreant to the high duty of punishing his murderers?"
5525,THE GHOST.,The ghost of William Zane admonishes me that there can be no repose for
5526,THE GHOST.,"my spirit until I take in hand the work of vengeance. Yes, if women"
5527,THE GHOST.,"have been accessory to that murder, they shall not be spared. Miss Agnes"

5570,ENCOMPASSED.,Podge Byerly was pale too.

5574,ENCOMPASSED.,"""To leave the settlement of this estate with such a cloud upon it would"

5576,ENCOMPASSED.,all here. There is a mystery somewhere which has not been pierced. It is
5577,ENCOMPASSED.,"very probably a domestic entanglement. I shall expect you (to Agnes),"
5578,ENCOMPASSED.,"and you, too,"" turning to Podge, ""to be absolutely frank with me. Miss"
5579,ENCOMPASSED.,"Agnes, have you seen Andrew Zane since his father's body was brought"
5580,ENCOMPASSED.,"into this house!"""
5581,ENCOMPASSED.,
5582,ENCOMPASSED.,Agnes looked around helplessly and uncertain. She took the tablets to
5583,ENCOMPASSED.,write a reply. Something seemed to arise in her mind to prevent the
5584,ENCOMPASSED.,intention. She burst into tears and left the table.
5585,ENCOMPASSED.,
5586,ENCOMPASSED.,"""Ha!"" thought Duff Salter grimly, ""there will be no confession there."
5587,ENCOMPASSED.,"Then, little Miss Byerly, I will try to throw off its guard thy saucy"
5588,ENCOMPASSED.,"perversity; for surely these two women understand each other."""
5589,ENCOMPASSED.,
5590,ENCOMPASSED.,After breakfast he followed Podge Byerly down Queen Street and through
5591,ENCOMPASSED.,"Beach, and came up with her as she went out of Kensington to the"
5592,ENCOMPASSED.,Delaware water-front about the old Northern Liberties district.
5593,ENCOMPASSED.,
5594,ENCOMPASSED.,"Duff bowed with a little of diffidence amid all his gravity, and sneezed"
5595,ENCOMPASSED.,as if to hide it:
5596,ENCOMPASSED.,
5597,ENCOMPASSED.,"""Jericho!--Miss Podge, see the time--eight o'clock, and an hour before"
5598,ENCOMPASSED.,"school. Let us go look at the river."""
5599,ENCOMPASSED.,
5600,ENCOMPASSED.,"They walked out on the wharf, and were wholly concealed from shore by"
5601,ENCOMPASSED.,piles of cord-wood and staves.
5602,ENCOMPASSED.,
5603,ENCOMPASSED.,"""I like to get off here, away from listeners, where I need not be"
5604,ENCOMPASSED.,"bellowed at and tire out well-meaning lungs. Now--Jericho! Jericho!"" he"
5605,ENCOMPASSED.,"sneezed, without any sort of meaning. ""Miss Podge,"" said Duff Salter,"
5606,ENCOMPASSED.,"""if you look directly into my eyes and articulate distinctly, I can hear"
5607,ENCOMPASSED.,all you say without raising your voice higher than usual. How much money
5608,ENCOMPASSED.,"do you get for school teaching?"""
5609,ENCOMPASSED.,
5610,ENCOMPASSED.,"""Five hundred dollars."""
5611,ENCOMPASSED.,
5612,ENCOMPASSED.,"""Is that all? What do you do with it?"""
5613,ENCOMPASSED.,
5614,ENCOMPASSED.,"""Support my mother and brother."""
5615,ENCOMPASSED.,
5616,ENCOMPASSED.,"""And yourself also?"""
5617,ENCOMPASSED.,
5618,ENCOMPASSED.,"""Oh! yes."""
5619,ENCOMPASSED.,
5620,ENCOMPASSED.,"""She can't do it!"" exclaimed Duff Salter inwardly; ""that director comes"
5621,ENCOMPASSED.,"in the case. Miss Podge, how old is your brother?"""
5622,ENCOMPASSED.,
5623,ENCOMPASSED.,"""Twenty-four. He's my junior,"" she said archly. ""I'm old."""
5624,ENCOMPASSED.,
5625,ENCOMPASSED.,"""Why do you support a man twenty-four years old? Did he meet with an"
5626,ENCOMPASSED.,"accident?"""
5627,ENCOMPASSED.,
5628,ENCOMPASSED.,"""He was taken sick, and will never be well,"" answered Podge warily."
5629,ENCOMPASSED.,
5630,ENCOMPASSED.,"""Excuse me!"" exclaimed Duff Salter, ""was it constitutional disease? You"
5631,ENCOMPASSED.,"know I am interested."""
5632,ENCOMPASSED.,
5633,ENCOMPASSED.,"""No, sir. He was misled. A woman, much older than himself, infatuated"
5634,ENCOMPASSED.,"him while a boy, and he married her, and she broke his health and ruined"
5635,ENCOMPASSED.,"him."""
5636,ENCOMPASSED.,
5637,ENCOMPASSED.,Podge's eyes fell for the first time.
5638,ENCOMPASSED.,
5639,ENCOMPASSED.,Duff Salter grasped her hand.
5640,ENCOMPASSED.,
5641,ENCOMPASSED.,"""And you tell me!"" he exclaimed, ""that you keep three grown people on"
5642,ENCOMPASSED.,"five hundred dollars a year? Don't you get help from any other quarter?"""
5643,ENCOMPASSED.,
5644,ENCOMPASSED.,"""Agnes has given me board for a hundred dollars a year,"" said Podge,"
5645,ENCOMPASSED.,"""but times have changed with her now, and money is scarce. She would"
5646,ENCOMPASSED.,"take other boarders, but public opinion is against her on all sides."
5647,ENCOMPASSED.,"It's against me too. But for love we would have separated long ago."""
5648,ENCOMPASSED.,
5649,ENCOMPASSED.,Podge's tears came.
5650,ENCOMPASSED.,
5651,ENCOMPASSED.,"""What right had you,"" exclaimed Duff Salter, rather angrily, ""to"
5652,ENCOMPASSED.,"maintain a whole family on the servitude of your young body, wearing its"
5653,ENCOMPASSED.,"roundness down to bone, exciting your nervous system, and inviting"
5654,ENCOMPASSED.,"premature age upon a nature created for a longer girlhood, and for the"
5655,ENCOMPASSED.,"solace of love?"""
5656,ENCOMPASSED.,
5657,ENCOMPASSED.,"She did not feel the anger in his tones; it seemed like protection, for"
5658,ENCOMPASSED.,which she had hungered.
5659,ENCOMPASSED.,
5660,ENCOMPASSED.,"""Why, sir, all women must support their poor kin."""
5661,ENCOMPASSED.,
5662,ENCOMPASSED.,"""Men don't do it!"" exclaimed Duff Salter, pushing aside his gray apron"
5663,ENCOMPASSED.,"of beard to see her more distinctly. ""Did that brother who rushed in"
5664,ENCOMPASSED.,vicious precocity to maintain another and a wicked woman ever think of
5665,ENCOMPASSED.,"relieving you from hard labor?"""
5666,ENCOMPASSED.,
5667,ENCOMPASSED.,"""He never could be anything less to me than brother!"" exclaimed Podge;"
5668,ENCOMPASSED.,"""but, Mr. Salter, if that was only all I had to trouble me! Oh, sir,"
5669,ENCOMPASSED.,"work is occupation, but work harassed with care for others becomes"
5670,ENCOMPASSED.,"unreal. I cannot sleep, thinking for Agnes. I cannot teach, my head"
5671,ENCOMPASSED.,"throbs so. That river, so cold and impure, going along by the wharves,"
5672,ENCOMPASSED.,"seems to suck and plash all day in my ears, as we see and hear it now."
5673,ENCOMPASSED.,"At my desk I seem to see those low shores and woods and marshes, on the"
5674,ENCOMPASSED.,"other side, and the chatter of children, going all day, laps and eddies"
5675,ENCOMPASSED.,up like dirty waves between me and that indistinct boundary. I am
5676,ENCOMPASSED.,"floating on the river current, drowning as I feel, reaching out for"
5677,ENCOMPASSED.,"nothing, for nothing is there. All day long it is so. I was the best"
5678,ENCOMPASSED.,"teacher in my rank, with certainty of promotion. I feel that I am losing"
5679,ENCOMPASSED.,"confidence. It is the river, the river, and has been so since it gave up"
5680,ENCOMPASSED.,"those dead bodies to bring us only ghosts and desolation."""
5681,ENCOMPASSED.,
5682,ENCOMPASSED.,"""It was a faithful witness,"" spoke Duff Salter, still harsh, as if under"
5683,ENCOMPASSED.,"an inner influence. ""Yes, a boy--a little boy such as you teach at"
5684,ENCOMPASSED.,school--had the strength to break the solid shield of ice under which
5685,ENCOMPASSED.,the river held up the dead and bring the murder out. Do you ever think
5686,ENCOMPASSED.,"of that as you hear a spectral river surge and buoy upward, whose waves"
5687,ENCOMPASSED.,"are made by children's murmurs--innocent children haunting the guilty?"""
5688,ENCOMPASSED.,
5689,ENCOMPASSED.,"""Do you mean me, Mr. Salter? Nothing haunts me but care."""
5690,ENCOMPASSED.,
5691,ENCOMPASSED.,"""I have been haunted by a ghost,"" continued Duff Salter. ""Yes, the ghost"
5692,ENCOMPASSED.,of my playmate has come to my threshold and peeped on me sitting there
5693,ENCOMPASSED.,inattentive to his right to vengeance. We shall all be haunted till we
5694,ENCOMPASSED.,"give our evidence for the dead. No rest will come till that is done."""
5695,ENCOMPASSED.,
5696,ENCOMPASSED.,"""I must go,"" cried Podge Byerly. ""You terrify me."""
5697,ENCOMPASSED.,
5698,ENCOMPASSED.,"""Tell me,"" asked Duff Salter in a low tone, ""has Andrew Zane been seen"
5699,ENCOMPASSED.,"by Agnes Wilt since he escaped?"""
5700,ENCOMPASSED.,
5701,ENCOMPASSED.,"""Don't ask me."""
5702,ENCOMPASSED.,
5703,ENCOMPASSED.,"""Tell me, and I will give you a sum of money which shall get you rest"
5704,ENCOMPASSED.,"for years. Open your mind to me, and I will send you to Europe. Your"
5705,ENCOMPASSED.,brother shall be my brother; your invalid mother will receive abundant
5706,ENCOMPASSED.,"care. I will even ask you to love me!"""
5707,ENCOMPASSED.,
5708,ENCOMPASSED.,"An instant's blushes overspread Podge's worn, pale face, and an"
5709,ENCOMPASSED.,expression of restful joy. Then recurring indignation made her pale
5710,ENCOMPASSED.,again to the very roots of her golden hair.
5711,ENCOMPASSED.,
5712,ENCOMPASSED.,"""Betray my friend!"" she exclaimed. ""Never, till she will give me leave."""
5713,ENCOMPASSED.,
5714,ENCOMPASSED.,"""I have lost my confidence in you both,"" said Duff Salter coldly,"
5715,ENCOMPASSED.,"releasing Podge's arm. ""You have been so indifferent in the face of this"
5716,ENCOMPASSED.,crime and public opinion as to receive your lovers in the very parlor
5717,ENCOMPASSED.,where my dead friend lay. Agnes has admitted it by silence. I have seen
5718,ENCOMPASSED.,"your lover releasing you from his arms. Miss Byerly, I thought you"
5719,ENCOMPASSED.,"artless, even in your arts, and only the dupe, perhaps, of a stronger"
5720,ENCOMPASSED.,woman. I hoped that you were pure. You have made me a man of suspicion
5721,ENCOMPASSED.,"and indifference again."" His face grew graver, yet unbelieving and hard."
5722,ENCOMPASSED.,
5723,ENCOMPASSED.,Podge fled from his side with alarm; he saw her handkerchief staunching
5724,ENCOMPASSED.,"her tears, and people watching her as she nearly ran along the sidewalk."
5725,ENCOMPASSED.,
5726,ENCOMPASSED.,"""Jericho! Jerichoo! Jer--"""
5727,ENCOMPASSED.,
5728,ENCOMPASSED.,"Duff Salter did not finish the sneeze, but with a long face called for a"
5729,ENCOMPASSED.,boat and rower to take him across to Treaty Island.
5730,ENCOMPASSED.,
5731,ENCOMPASSED.,"Podge arrived at school just as the bell was ringing, and, still in"
5732,ENCOMPASSED.,"nervousness and tears, took her place in her division while the Bible"
5733,ENCOMPASSED.,was read. She saw the principal's eye upon her as she took off her
5734,ENCOMPASSED.,"bonnet and moistened her face, and the boys looked up a minute or two"
5735,ENCOMPASSED.,"inquiringly, but soon relapsed to their individual selfishness. When the"
5736,ENCOMPASSED.,"glass sashes dividing the rooms were closed and the recitations began,"
5737,ENCOMPASSED.,"the lapping sound of the river started anew. A film grew on her eyes,"
5738,ENCOMPASSED.,"and in it appeared the distant Jersey and island shore, with the"
5739,ENCOMPASSED.,"uncertain boundary of point, cove, and marsh, like a misty cold line,"
5740,ENCOMPASSED.,"cheerless and void of life or color, as it was every day, yet standing"
5741,ENCOMPASSED.,"there as if it merely came of right and was the river's true border, and"
5742,ENCOMPASSED.,was not to be hated as such. Podge strained to look through the
5743,ENCOMPASSED.,"illusion, and walked down the aisle once, where it seemed to be, and"
5744,ENCOMPASSED.,touched the plaster of the wall. She had hardly receded when it
5745,ENCOMPASSED.,"reappeared, and all between it and her mind was merely empty river,"
5746,ENCOMPASSED.,"wallowing and lapping and sucking and subsiding, as if around submerged"
5747,ENCOMPASSED.,"piers, or wave was relieving wave from the weight of floating things"
5748,ENCOMPASSED.,"like rafts, or logs, or buoys, or bodies. Into this wide waste of muddy"
5749,ENCOMPASSED.,"ripples every sound in the school-room swam, and also sights and colors,"
5750,ENCOMPASSED.,till between her eye-lash and that filmy distant margin nothing existed
5751,ENCOMPASSED.,"but a freshet, alive yet with nothing, eddying around with purposeless"
5752,ENCOMPASSED.,"power, and still moving onward with an under force. The open book in her"
5753,ENCOMPASSED.,"hand appeared like a great white wharf, or pier, covered with lime and"
5754,ENCOMPASSED.,"coal in spots and places, and pushed forward into this hissing,"
5755,ENCOMPASSED.,"rippling, exclaiming deluge, which washed its base and spread beyond."
5756,ENCOMPASSED.,"Podge could barely read a question in the book, and the sound of her"
5757,ENCOMPASSED.,voice was like gravel or sand pushed off the wharf into the river and
5758,ENCOMPASSED.,swallowed there. She thought she heard an answer in a muddy tone and
5759,ENCOMPASSED.,"gave the question out again, and there seemed to be laughter, as if the"
5760,ENCOMPASSED.,"waters, or what was drowned in them, chuckled and purled, going along."
5761,ENCOMPASSED.,"She raised her eyes above the laughers, and there the boundary line of"
5762,ENCOMPASSED.,"Jersey stood defined, and all in front of it was the drifting Delaware."
5763,ENCOMPASSED.,"It seemed to her that boys were darting to and fro and swapping seats,"
5764,ENCOMPASSED.,and one boy had thrown a handful of beans. She walked down the aisle as
5765,ENCOMPASSED.,"if into water, wading through pools and waves of boys, who plashed and"
5766,ENCOMPASSED.,"gurgled around her. She walked back again, and a surf of boys was thrown"
5767,ENCOMPASSED.,at her feet. The waters rose and licked and spilled and flowed onward
5768,ENCOMPASSED.,"again. Podge felt a sense of strangling, as if going down, in a hollow"
5769,ENCOMPASSED.,"gulf of resounding wave, and shouted:"
5770,ENCOMPASSED.,
5771,ENCOMPASSED.,"""Help! Save me! Save me!"""
5772,ENCOMPASSED.,
5773,ENCOMPASSED.,"She heard a voice like the principal teacher's, say in a lapping, watery"
5774,ENCOMPASSED.,"way, ""Miss Byerly, what is the meaning of this? Your division is in"
5775,ENCOMPASSED.,disorder. Nobody has recited. Unless you are ill I must suspend you and
5776,ENCOMPASSED.,"call another teacher here."""
5777,ENCOMPASSED.,
5778,ENCOMPASSED.,"""Help! I'm floating off upon the river. Save me! I drown! I drown!"""
5779,ENCOMPASSED.,
5780,ENCOMPASSED.,The scholars were all up and excited. The principal motioned another
5781,ENCOMPASSED.,"lady teacher to come, and laid Podge's head in the other's lap."
5782,ENCOMPASSED.,
5783,ENCOMPASSED.,"""Is it brain fever?"" he asked."
5784,ENCOMPASSED.,
5785,ENCOMPASSED.,"""She has been under great excitement,"" Podge heard the other lady say."
5786,ENCOMPASSED.,"""The Zane murder occurred in her family. Last night, I have been told,"
5787,ENCOMPASSED.,"Miss Byerly refused Mr. Bunn, our principal school director, and a man"
5788,ENCOMPASSED.,"of large means, who had long been in love with her."""
5789,ENCOMPASSED.,
5790,ENCOMPASSED.,"""Where is he?"" said the principal."
5791,ENCOMPASSED.,
5792,ENCOMPASSED.,"""I heard it from his sister,"" said the other lady. ""Mortified at her"
5793,ENCOMPASSED.,"refusal, because confident that she would accept him, he sailed this day"
5794,ENCOMPASSED.,"for Europe."""
5795,ENCOMPASSED.,
5796,ENCOMPASSED.,These were the last words Podge Byerly heard. Then it seemed that the
5797,ENCOMPASSED.,waters closed over her head.
5798,ENCOMPASSED.,
5799,ENCOMPASSED.,*       *       *       *       *
5800,ENCOMPASSED.,
5801,ENCOMPASSED.,"Agnes, left alone in the homestead, had a few days of perfect relief,"
5802,ENCOMPASSED.,except from anonymous letters and newspaper clippings delivered by mail.
5803,ENCOMPASSED.,That refined handwriting which had steadily poured out the venom of some
5804,ENCOMPASSED.,concealed hostility survived all other correspondence--delicate as the
5805,ENCOMPASSED.,graceful circles of the tiniest fish-hooks whose points and barbs enter
5806,ENCOMPASSED.,deepest in the flesh.
5807,ENCOMPASSED.,
5808,ENCOMPASSED.,"""Whom can this creature be?"" asked Agnes, bringing up her strong mind"
5809,ENCOMPASSED.,"from its trouble. ""I can have made no such bitter enemy by any act of"
5810,ENCOMPASSED.,mine. A man would hardly pursue so light a purpose with such stability.
5811,ENCOMPASSED.,"There is more than jealousy in it; it is sincere hate, drawn, I should"
5812,ENCOMPASSED.,"think, from a deep social or mental resentment, and enraged because I do"
5813,ENCOMPASSED.,"not sink under my troubles. Yes, this must be a woman who believes me"
5814,ENCOMPASSED.,"innocent but wishes my ruin. Some one, perhaps, who is sinning"
5815,ENCOMPASSED.,"unsuspected, and, in her envy of another and purer one, gloats in the"
5816,ENCOMPASSED.,"scandal which does not justly stain me. The anonymous letter,"" thought"
5817,ENCOMPASSED.,"Agnes, ""is a malignant form of conscience, after all!"""
5818,ENCOMPASSED.,
5819,ENCOMPASSED.,"But life, as it was growing to be in the Zane house, was hardly worth"
5820,ENCOMPASSED.,living. Podge Byerly was broken down and dangerously ill at her mother's
5821,ENCOMPASSED.,"little house. All of Agnes's callers had dropped off, and she felt that"
5822,ENCOMPASSED.,"she could no longer worship, except as a show, at Van de Lear's church;"
5823,ENCOMPASSED.,but this deprivation only deepened Agnes's natural devotion. Duff Salter
5824,ENCOMPASSED.,"saw her once, and oftener heard her praying, as the strong wail of it"
5825,ENCOMPASSED.,ascending through the house pierced even his ears.
5826,ENCOMPASSED.,
5827,ENCOMPASSED.,"""That woman,"" said Duff, ""is wonderfully armed; with beauty, courage,"
5828,ENCOMPASSED.,"mystery, witchery, she might almost deceive a God."""
5829,ENCOMPASSED.,
5830,ENCOMPASSED.,The theory that the house was haunted confirmed the other theory that a
5831,ENCOMPASSED.,crime rested upon its inmates.
5832,ENCOMPASSED.,
5833,ENCOMPASSED.,"""Why should there be a ghost unless there had been a murder?"" asked the"
5834,ENCOMPASSED.,"average gossip and Fishtowner, to whom the marvellous was certain and"
5835,ENCOMPASSED.,"the real to be inferred from it. Duff Salter believed in the ghost, as"
5836,ENCOMPASSED.,"Agnes was satisfied; he had become unsocial and suspicious in look, and"
5837,ENCOMPASSED.,"after two or three days of absence from the house, succeeding Podge's"
5838,ENCOMPASSED.,"disappearance, entered it with his new servant."
5839,ENCOMPASSED.,
5840,ENCOMPASSED.,"Agnes did not see the servant at all for some days, though knowing that"
5841,ENCOMPASSED.,"he had come. The cook said he was an accommodating man, ready to help"
5842,ENCOMPASSED.,"her at anything, and of no ""airs."" He entered and went, the cook said,"
5843,ENCOMPASSED.,"by the back gate, always wiped his feet at the door, and appeared like a"
5844,ENCOMPASSED.,"person of not much ""bringing up."" One day Agnes had to descend to the"
5845,ENCOMPASSED.,"kitchen, and there she saw a strange man eating with the cook; a rough"
5846,ENCOMPASSED.,person with a head of dark red hair and grayish red beard all round his
5847,ENCOMPASSED.,"mouth and under his chin. She observed that he was one-legged, and used"
5848,ENCOMPASSED.,a common wooden crutch on the side of the wooden leg. Two long scars
5849,ENCOMPASSED.,"covered his face, and one shaggy eyebrow was higher than the other."
5850,ENCOMPASSED.,
5851,ENCOMPASSED.,"""I axes your pardon,"" said the man; ""me and cook takes our snack when we"
5852,ENCOMPASSED.,"can, mum."""
5853,ENCOMPASSED.,
5854,ENCOMPASSED.,A day or two after Agnes passed the same man again at the landing on the
5855,ENCOMPASSED.,"stairway. He bowed, and said in his Scotch or Irish dialect,"
5856,ENCOMPASSED.,
5857,ENCOMPASSED.,"""God bless ye, mum!"""
5858,ENCOMPASSED.,
5859,ENCOMPASSED.,Agnes thought to herself that she had not given the man credit for a
5860,ENCOMPASSED.,"certain rough grace which she now perceived, and as she turned back to"
5861,ENCOMPASSED.,"look at him he was looking at her with a fixed, incomprehensible"
5862,ENCOMPASSED.,expression.
5863,ENCOMPASSED.,
5864,ENCOMPASSED.,"""Am I being watched?"" thought Agnes."
5865,ENCOMPASSED.,
5866,ENCOMPASSED.,"One day, in early June, as Agnes entered the parlor, she found Reverend"
5867,ENCOMPASSED.,"Silas Van de Lear there. At the sight of this good old man, the"
5868,ENCOMPASSED.,"patriarch of Kensington, by whom she had been baptized and received into"
5869,ENCOMPASSED.,"the communion, Agnes Wilt felt strongly moved, the more that in his eyes"
5870,ENCOMPASSED.,was a regard of sympathy just a little touched with doubt.
5871,ENCOMPASSED.,
5872,ENCOMPASSED.,"""My daughter!"" exclaimed the old man, in his clear, practised"
5873,ENCOMPASSED.,"articulation, ""you are daily in my prayers!"""
5874,ENCOMPASSED.,
5875,ENCOMPASSED.,"The tears came to Agnes, and as she attempted to wipe them away the good"
5876,ENCOMPASSED.,old gentleman drew her head to his shoulder.
5877,ENCOMPASSED.,
5878,ENCOMPASSED.,"""I cannot let myself think any evil of you, dear sister, in God's"
5879,ENCOMPASSED.,"chastising providence,"" said the clergyman. ""Among the angels, in the"
5880,ENCOMPASSED.,"land that is awaiting me, I had expected to see the beautiful face"
5881,ENCOMPASSED.,"which has so often encouraged my preaching, and looked up at me from"
5882,ENCOMPASSED.,Sabbath-school and church. You do not come to our meetings any more. My
5883,ENCOMPASSED.,"dear, let us pray together in your affliction."""
5884,ENCOMPASSED.,
5885,ENCOMPASSED.,"The old man knelt in the parlor and raised his voice in prayer--a clear,"
5886,ENCOMPASSED.,"considerate, judicial, sincere prayer, such as age and long authority"
5887,ENCOMPASSED.,gave him the right to address to heaven. He was not unacquainted with
5888,ENCOMPASSED.,"sorrow himself; his children had given him much concern, and even"
5889,ENCOMPASSED.,"anguish, and in Calvin was his last hope. A thread of wicked commonplace"
5890,ENCOMPASSED.,ran through them all; his sterling nature in their composition was lost
5891,ENCOMPASSED.,"like a grain of gold in a mass of alloy. They had nothing ideal, no"
5892,ENCOMPASSED.,"reverence, no sense of delicacy. Taking to his arms a face and form that"
5893,ENCOMPASSED.,"pleased him, the minister had not ingrafted upon it one babe of any"
5894,ENCOMPASSED.,divinity; that coarser matrix received the sacred flame as mere mud
5895,ENCOMPASSED.,extinguishes the lightning. He fell into this reminiscence of personal
5896,ENCOMPASSED.,"disappointment unwittingly, as in the process of his prayer he strove to"
5897,ENCOMPASSED.,comfort Agnes. The moment he did so the cold magistracy of the prayer
5898,ENCOMPASSED.,"ceased, and his voice began to tremble, and there ran between the"
5899,ENCOMPASSED.,ecclesiastic and his parishioner the electric spark of mutual grief and
5900,ENCOMPASSED.,understanding.
5901,ENCOMPASSED.,
5902,ENCOMPASSED.,"The old man hesitated, and became choked with emotion."
5903,ENCOMPASSED.,
5904,ENCOMPASSED.,"As he stopped, and the pause was prolonged, Agnes herself, by a powerful"
5905,ENCOMPASSED.,"inner impulsion, took up the prayer aloud, and carried it along like"
5906,ENCOMPASSED.,"inspiration. She was not of the strong-minded type of women, rather of"
5907,ENCOMPASSED.,"the wholly loving; but the deep afflictions of the past few months,"
5908,ENCOMPASSED.,"working down into the crevices and cells of her nature, had struck the"
5909,ENCOMPASSED.,"impervious bed of piety, and so deluged it with sorrow and the lonely"
5910,ENCOMPASSED.,sense of helplessness that now a cry like an appeal to judgment broke
5911,ENCOMPASSED.,"from her, not despair nor accusation, but an appeal to the very equity"
5912,ENCOMPASSED.,of God.
5913,ENCOMPASSED.,
5914,ENCOMPASSED.,"It arose so frankly and in such majesty, finding its own aptest words by"
5915,ENCOMPASSED.,"its unconscious instinct, that the aged minister was presently aware of"
5916,ENCOMPASSED.,"a preternatural power at his side. Was this woman a witch, genius,"
5917,ENCOMPASSED.,"demon, or the very priestess of God, he asked."
5918,ENCOMPASSED.,
5919,ENCOMPASSED.,The solemn prayer ranged into his own experience by that touch of nature
5920,ENCOMPASSED.,"which unlocks the secret spring of all, being true unto its own deep"
5921,ENCOMPASSED.,needs. The minister was swept along in the resistless current of the
5922,ENCOMPASSED.,"prayer, and listened as if he were the penitent and she the priest. As"
5923,ENCOMPASSED.,"the petition died away in Agnes's physical exhaustion, the venerable man"
5924,ENCOMPASSED.,thought to himself:
5925,ENCOMPASSED.,
5926,ENCOMPASSED.,"""When Jacob wrestled all night at Peniel, his angel must have been a"
5927,ENCOMPASSED.,"woman like this; for she has power with God and with men!"""

5936,FOCUS.,
5937,FOCUS.,"Calvin Van de Lear had been up-stairs with Duff Salter, and on his way"
5938,FOCUS.,out had heard the voice of Agnes Wilt praying. He slipped into the back
5939,FOCUS.,parlor and listened at the crevice of the folding-door until his father
5940,FOCUS.,had given the pastoral benediction and departed. Then with cool
5941,FOCUS.,"effrontery Calvin walked into the front parlor, where Agnes was sitting"
5942,FOCUS.,by the slats of the nearly darkened window.
5943,FOCUS.,
5944,FOCUS.,"""Pardon me, Agnes,"" he said. ""I was calling on the deaf old gentleman"
5945,FOCUS.,"up-stairs, and perceiving that devotions were being conducted here,"
5946,FOCUS.,"stopped that I might not interrupt them."""
5947,FOCUS.,
5948,FOCUS.,Calvin's commonplace nature had hardly been dazed by Agnes's prayer. He
5949,FOCUS.,"was only confirmed in the idea that she was a woman of genius, and would"
5950,FOCUS.,take half the work of a pastor off his hands. In the light of both
5951,FOCUS.,"desire and convenience she had, therefore, appreciated in his eyes. To"
5952,FOCUS.,"marry her, become the proprietor of her snug home and ravishing person,"
5953,FOCUS.,and send her off to pray with the sick and sup with the older women of
5954,FOCUS.,"the flock, seemed to him such a comfortable consummation as to have"
5955,FOCUS.,Heaven's especial approval. Thus do we deceive ourselves when the spirit
5956,FOCUS.,"of God has departed from us, even in youth, and construe our dreams of"
5957,FOCUS.,selfishness to be glimmerings of a purer life.
5958,FOCUS.,
5959,FOCUS.,"Calvin was precocious in assurance, because, in addition to being"
5960,FOCUS.,"unprincipled, he was in a manner ordained by election and birthright to"
5961,FOCUS.,"rule over Kensington. His father had been one of those strong-willed,"
5962,FOCUS.,"clear-visioned, intelligent young Eastern divinity students who brought"
5963,FOCUS.,to a place of more voluptuous and easy burgher society the secular vigor
5964,FOCUS.,"of New England pastors. Being always superior and always sincere, his"
5965,FOCUS.,"rule had been ungrumblingly accepted. Another generation, at middle age,"
5966,FOCUS.,"found him over them as he had been over their parents--a righteous,"
5967,FOCUS.,"intrepid Protestant priest, good at denunciation, counsel, humor, or"
5968,FOCUS.,sympathy. The elders and deacons never thought of objecting to anything
5969,FOCUS.,"after he had insisted upon it, and in this spirit the whole church had"
5970,FOCUS.,heard submissively that Calvin Van de Lear was to be their next pastor.
5971,FOCUS.,"This, of course, was conditional upon his behavior, and all knew that"
5972,FOCUS.,his father would be the last man to impose an injurious person on the
5973,FOCUS.,"church; they had little idea that ""Cal."" Van de Lear was devout, but"
5974,FOCUS.,took the old man's word that grace grew more and more in the sons of the
5975,FOCUS.,"Elect, and the young man had already professed ""conviction,"" and"
5976,FOCUS.,"voluntarily been received into the church. There he assumed, like an"
5977,FOCUS.,"heir-apparent, the vicarship of the congregation, and it rather"
5978,FOCUS.,delighted his father that his son so promptly and complacently took
5979,FOCUS.,"direction of things, made his quasi pastoral rounds, led"
5980,FOCUS.,"prayer-meetings, and exhorted Sunday-schools and missions. A priest"
5981,FOCUS.,"knows the heart of his son no more than a king, and is less suspicious"
5982,FOCUS.,of him. The king's son may rebel from deferred expectation; the priest's
5983,FOCUS.,son can hardly conspire against his father's pulpit. In the minister's
5984,FOCUS.,family the line between the world and the faith is a wavering one;
5985,FOCUS.,"religion becomes a matter of course, and yet is without the mystery of"
5986,FOCUS.,"religion as elsewhere, so that wife and sons regard ecclesiastical"
5987,FOCUS.,"ambition as meritorious, whether the heart be in it piously or"
5988,FOCUS.,"profanely. Calvin Van de Lear was in the church fold of his own accord,"
5989,FOCUS.,and his father could no more read that son's heart than any other
5990,FOCUS.,"member's. Indeed, the good old man was especially obtuse in the son's"
5991,FOCUS.,"case, from his partiality, and thus grew up together on the same root"
5992,FOCUS.,"the flower of piety and hypocrisy, the tree and the sucker."
5993,FOCUS.,
5994,FOCUS.,"""Calvin,"" replied Agnes, ""I do not object to your necessary visits here."
5995,FOCUS.,"Your father is very dear to me."""
5996,FOCUS.,
5997,FOCUS.,"""But can't I return to the subject we last talked of?"" asked the young"
5998,FOCUS.,"man, shrewdly."
5999,FOCUS.,
6000,FOCUS.,"""No. That is positively forbidden."""
6001,FOCUS.,
6002,FOCUS.,"""Agnes,"" continued Calvin, ""you must know I love you!"""
6003,FOCUS.,
6004,FOCUS.,Agnes sank to her seat again with a look of resignation.
6005,FOCUS.,
6006,FOCUS.,"""Calvin,"" she said, ""this is not the time. I am not the person for such"
6007,FOCUS.,remarks. I have just risen from my knees; my eyes are not in this
6008,FOCUS.,"world."""
6009,FOCUS.,
6010,FOCUS.,"""You will be turning nun if this continues."""
6011,FOCUS.,
6012,FOCUS.,"""I am in God's hands,"" said Agnes. ""Yet the hour is dark with me."""
6013,FOCUS.,
6014,FOCUS.,"""Agnes, let me lift some of your burden upon myself. You don't hate me?"""
6015,FOCUS.,
6016,FOCUS.,"""No. I wish you every happiness, Calvin."""
6017,FOCUS.,
6018,FOCUS.,"""Is there nothing you long for--nothing earthly and within the compass"
6019,FOCUS.,"of possibility?"""
6020,FOCUS.,
6021,FOCUS.,"""Yes, yes!"" Agnes arose and walked across the floor almost"
6022,FOCUS.,"unconsciously, with the palms of her hands held high together above her"
6023,FOCUS.,head. As she walked to and fro the theological student perceived a
6024,FOCUS.,change so extraordinary in her appearance since his last visit that he
6025,FOCUS.,"measured her in his cool, worldly gaze as a butcher would compute the"
6026,FOCUS.,weight of a cow on chance reckoning.
6027,FOCUS.,
6028,FOCUS.,"""What is it, dear Agnes?"""
6029,FOCUS.,
6030,FOCUS.,"He spoke with a softness of tone little in keeping with his unfeeling,"
6031,FOCUS.,vigilant face.
6032,FOCUS.,
6033,FOCUS.,"""Oh, give me love! Now, if ever, it is love! Love only, that can lift me"
6034,FOCUS.,"up and cleanse my soul!"""
6035,FOCUS.,
6036,FOCUS.,"""Love lies everywhere around you,"" said the young man. ""You trample it"
6037,FOCUS.,under your feet. My heart--many hearts--have felt the cruel treatment.
6038,FOCUS.,"Agnes, _you_ must love also."""
6039,FOCUS.,
6040,FOCUS.,"""I try to do so,"" she exclaimed, ""but it is not the perfect love that"
6041,FOCUS.,"casteth out fear! God knows I wish it was."""
6042,FOCUS.,
6043,FOCUS.,"Her eyes glanced down, and a blush, sudden and deep, spread over her"
6044,FOCUS.,"features. The young man lost nothing of all this, but with alert"
6045,FOCUS.,analysis took every expression and action in.
6046,FOCUS.,
6047,FOCUS.,"""May I become your friend if greater need arises, Agnes? Do not repulse"
6048,FOCUS.,"me. At the worst--I swear it!--I will be your instrument, your subject."""
6049,FOCUS.,
6050,FOCUS.,"Agnes sat in the renewed pallor of profound fear. God, on whom she had"
6051,FOCUS.,"but a moment before called, seemed to have withdrawn His face. Her black"
6052,FOCUS.,"ringlets, smoothed upon her noble brow in wavy lines, gave her something"
6053,FOCUS.,"of a Roman matron's look; her eyebrows, dark as the eyes beneath that"
6054,FOCUS.,"now shrank back yet shone the larger, might have befitted an Eastern"
6055,FOCUS.,"queen. Lips of unconscious invitation, and features produced in their"
6056,FOCUS.,wholeness which bore out a character too perfect not to have lived
6057,FOCUS.,"sometime in the realms of the great tragedies of life, made Agnes in her"
6058,FOCUS.,sorrow peerless yet.
6059,FOCUS.,
6060,FOCUS.,"""Go, Calvin!"" she said, with an effort, her eyes still upon the floor;"
6061,FOCUS.,"""if you would ever do me any aid, go now!"""
6062,FOCUS.,
6063,FOCUS.,As he passed into the passageway Calvin Van de Lear ran against a man
6064,FOCUS.,"with a crutch and a wooden leg, who looked at him from under a head of"
6065,FOCUS.,"dark-red hair, and in a low voice cursed his awkwardness. The man bent"
6066,FOCUS.,"to pick up his crutch, and Calvin observed that he was badly scarred and"
6067,FOCUS.,had one eyebrow higher than the other.
6068,FOCUS.,
6069,FOCUS.,"""Who are you, fellow?"" asked Calvin, surprised."
6070,FOCUS.,
6071,FOCUS.,"""I'm Dogcatcher!"" said the man. ""When ye see me coming, take the other"
6072,FOCUS.,"side of the street."""
6073,FOCUS.,
6074,FOCUS.,"Calvin felt cowed, not so much at these mysterious words as at a hard,"
6075,FOCUS.,"lowering look in the man's face, like especial dislike."
6076,FOCUS.,
6077,FOCUS.,"Agnes Wilt, still sitting in the parlor, saw the lame servant pass her"
6078,FOCUS.,"door, going out, and he looked in and touched his hat, and paused a"
6079,FOCUS.,minute. Something graceful and wistful together seemed to be in his
6080,FOCUS.,bearing and countenance.
6081,FOCUS.,
6082,FOCUS.,"""Anything for me?"" asked Agnes."
6083,FOCUS.,
6084,FOCUS.,"""Nothing at all, mum! When there's nobody by to do a job, call on Mike."""
6085,FOCUS.,
6086,FOCUS.,"He still seemed to tarry, and in Agnes's nervous condition a mysterious"
6087,FOCUS.,awe came over her; the man's gaze had a dread fascination that would not
6088,FOCUS.,let her drop her eyes. As he passed out of sight and shut the street
6089,FOCUS.,"door behind him Agnes felt a fainting feeling, as if an apparition had"
6090,FOCUS.,"looked in upon her and vanished--the apparition, if of anything, of him"
6091,FOCUS.,"who had lain dead in that very parlor--the stern, enamored master of the"
6092,FOCUS.,"house whose fatherhood in a fateful moment had turned to marital desire,"
6093,FOCUS.,and crushed the luck of all the race of Zanes.
6094,FOCUS.,
6095,FOCUS.,"Duff Salter was sitting at his writing table, with an open snuff-box"
6096,FOCUS.,"before him, and, as Calvin Van de Lear entered his room, Duff took a"
6097,FOCUS.,large pinch of snuff and shoved the tablets forward. Calvin wrote on
6098,FOCUS.,them a short sentence. As Duff Salter read it he started to his feet and
6099,FOCUS.,sneezed with tremendous energy:
6100,FOCUS.,
6101,FOCUS.,"""Jeri-cho! Jericho! Jerry-cho-o-o!"""
6102,FOCUS.,
6103,FOCUS.,"He read the sentence again, and whispered very low:"
6104,FOCUS.,
6105,FOCUS.,"""Can't you be mistaken?"""
6106,FOCUS.,
6107,FOCUS.,"""As sure as you sit there!"" wrote Calvin Van de Lear."
6108,FOCUS.,
6109,FOCUS.,"""What is your inference?"" wrote Duff Salter."
6110,FOCUS.,
6111,FOCUS.,"""Seduction!"""
6112,FOCUS.,
6113,FOCUS.,"The two men looked at each other silently a few minutes, Duff Salter in"
6114,FOCUS.,"profound astonishment, Calvin Van de Lear with an impudent smile."
6115,FOCUS.,
6116,FOCUS.,"""And so religious!"" wrote Duff Salter."
6117,FOCUS.,
6118,FOCUS.,"""That is always incidental to the condition,"" answered Calvin."
6119,FOCUS.,
6120,FOCUS.,"""It must be a great blow to your affection?"""
6121,FOCUS.,
6122,FOCUS.,"""Not at all,"" scrawled the minister's son. ""It gives me a sure thing."""
6123,FOCUS.,
6124,FOCUS.,"""Explain that!"""
6125,FOCUS.,
6126,FOCUS.,"""I will throw the marriage mantle over her. She will need me now!"""
6127,FOCUS.,
6128,FOCUS.,"""But you would not take a wife out of such a situation?"""
6129,FOCUS.,
6130,FOCUS.,"""Oh! yes. She will be as handsome as ever, and only half as proud."""
6131,FOCUS.,
6132,FOCUS.,"Duff Salter walked up and down the floor and stroked his long beard, and"
6133,FOCUS.,"his usually benevolent expression was now dark and ominous, as if with"
6134,FOCUS.,gloom and anger. He spoke in a low tone as if not aware that he was
6135,FOCUS.,"heard, and his voice sounded as if he also did not hear it, and could"
6136,FOCUS.,"not, therefore, give it pitch or intonation:"
6137,FOCUS.,
6138,FOCUS.,"""Is this the best of old Kensington? This is the East! Where I dreamed"
6139,FOCUS.,that life was pure as the water from the dear old pump that quenched my
6140,FOCUS.,thirst in boyhood--not bitter as the alkali of the streams of the
6141,FOCUS.,"plains, nor turbid like the rills of the Arkansas. I pined to leave that"
6142,FOCUS.,"life of renegades, half-breeds, squaws, and nomads to bathe my soul in"
6143,FOCUS.,"the clear fountains of civilization,--to live where marriage was holy"
6144,FOCUS.,"and piety sincere. I find, instead, mystery, blood, dishonor, hypocrisy,"
6145,FOCUS.,and shame. Let me go back! The rough frontier suits me best. If I can
6146,FOCUS.,"hear so much wickedness, deaf as I am, let me rather be an unsocial"
6147,FOCUS.,"hermit in the woods, hearing nothing lower than thunder!"""
6148,FOCUS.,
6149,FOCUS.,As Duff Salter went to his dinner that day he looked at Agnes sitting in
6150,FOCUS.,"her place, so ill at ease, and said to himself,"
6151,FOCUS.,
6152,FOCUS.,"""It is true."""
6153,FOCUS.,
6154,FOCUS.,*       *       *       *       *
6155,FOCUS.,
6156,FOCUS.,Another matter of concern was on Mr. Duff Salter's mind--his
6157,FOCUS.,serving-man. Such an unequal servant he had never seen--at times full of
6158,FOCUS.,"intelligence and snap, again as dumb as the bog-trotters of Ireland."
6159,FOCUS.,
6160,FOCUS.,"""What was the matter with you yesterday?"" asked the deaf man of Mike one"
6161,FOCUS.,day.
6162,FOCUS.,
6163,FOCUS.,"""Me head, yer honor!"""
6164,FOCUS.,
6165,FOCUS.,"""What ails your head?"""
6166,FOCUS.,
6167,FOCUS.,"""Vare-tigo!"""
6168,FOCUS.,
6169,FOCUS.,"""How came that?"""
6170,FOCUS.,
6171,FOCUS.,"""Falling out of a ship!"""
6172,FOCUS.,
6173,FOCUS.,"""What did you strike but water?"""
6174,FOCUS.,
6175,FOCUS.,"""Wood; it nearly was the death of me. For weeks I was wid a cracked head"
6176,FOCUS.,"and a cracked leg, yer honor!"""
6177,FOCUS.,
6178,FOCUS.,"Still there was something evasive about the man, and he had as many"
6179,FOCUS.,"moods and lights as a sea Proteus, ugly and common, like that batrachian"
6180,FOCUS.,"order, but often enkindled and exceedingly satisfactory as a servant. He"
6181,FOCUS.,"often forgot the place where he left off a certain day's work, and it"
6182,FOCUS.,"had to be recalled to him. He was irregular, too, in going and coming,"
6183,FOCUS.,and was quite as likely to come when not wanted as not to be on the spot
6184,FOCUS.,when due and expected. Duff Salter made up his mind that all the Eastern
6185,FOCUS.,people must have bumped their heads and became subject to vertigo.
6186,FOCUS.,
6187,FOCUS.,One day Duff Salter received this note:
6188,FOCUS.,
6189,FOCUS.,"""MR. DEAF DUFF: Excuse the familiarity, but the coincidence amuses"
6190,FOCUS.,me. I want you to make me a visit this evening after dark at my
6191,FOCUS.,"quarters in my brother, Knox Van de Lear's house, on Queen Street"
6192,FOCUS.,nearly opposite your place of lodging. If Mars crosses the orbit of
6193,FOCUS.,"Venus to-night, as I expect--there being signs of it in the milky"
6194,FOCUS.,"way,--you will assist me in an observation that will stagger you on"
6195,FOCUS.,"account of its results. Do not come out until dark, and ask at my"
6196,FOCUS.,"brother's den for                                   CAL."""
6197,FOCUS.,
6198,FOCUS.,"""I will not be in to-night, Mike,"" exclaimed Duff Salter a little while"
6199,FOCUS.,"afterward. ""You can have all the evening to yourself. Where do you spend"
6200,FOCUS.,"your spare time?"""
6201,FOCUS.,
6202,FOCUS.,"""On Traity Island,"" replied Mike with a grin. ""I doesn't like Kinsington"
6203,FOCUS.,"afther dark. They say it has ghosts, sur."""
6204,FOCUS.,
6205,FOCUS.,"""But only the ghosts of they killed as they crossed from Treaty Island."""
6206,FOCUS.,
6207,FOCUS.,"""Sure enough! But I've lost belafe in ghosts since they have become so"
6208,FOCUS.,"common. Everybody belaves in thim in Kinsington, and I prefer to be"
6209,FOCUS.,"exclusive and sciptical, yer honor."""
6210,FOCUS.,
6211,FOCUS.,"""Didn't you tell me yesterday that you believed in spirits going and"
6212,FOCUS.,"coming and hoping and waiting, and it gave you great comfort?"""
6213,FOCUS.,
6214,FOCUS.,"""Did I, sur? I forgit it inthirely. It must have been a bad day for my"
6215,FOCUS.,"vartigo."""
6216,FOCUS.,
6217,FOCUS.,"Duff Salter looked at his man long and earnestly, and from head to foot,"
6218,FOCUS.,and the inspection appeared to please him.
6219,FOCUS.,
6220,FOCUS.,"""Mike,"" he said, in his loud, deafish voice, ""I am going to cure you of"
6221,FOCUS.,"your vertigo."""
6222,FOCUS.,
6223,FOCUS.,"""Whin, dear Mister Salter."""
6224,FOCUS.,
6225,FOCUS.,"""Perhaps to-morrow,"" remarked Duff Salter significantly. ""I shall have a"
6226,FOCUS.,man here who will either confer it on you permanently or cure you
6227,FOCUS.,"instantly."""
6228,FOCUS.,
6229,FOCUS.,"Duff Salter put on his hat, took his stick, and drew the curtains down."
6230,FOCUS.,
6231,FOCUS.,Mike was sitting at the writing table arranging some models of vessels
6232,FOCUS.,"and steam tugs as his employer turned at the doorway and looked back,"
6233,FOCUS.,"and, with a countenance more waggish than exasperated, Duff Salter shook"
6234,FOCUS.,"his cane at the unobservant Irishman, and sagely gestured with his head."
6235,FOCUS.,
6236,FOCUS.,Agnes was about to take the head of the tea-table as he came down the
6237,FOCUS.,stairs.
6238,FOCUS.,
6239,FOCUS.,"""No,"" motioned Duff Salter, and pointed out of doors."
6240,FOCUS.,
6241,FOCUS.,"He gave a slight examination to Agnes, so delicate as to be almost"
6242,FOCUS.,"unnoticed, though she perceived it."
6243,FOCUS.,
6244,FOCUS.,Duff sat at the tea side and wrote on his tablets:
6245,FOCUS.,
6246,FOCUS.,"""How is little Podge coming on?"""
6247,FOCUS.,
6248,FOCUS.,"""Growing better,"" replied Agnes, ""but she will be unfit to teach her"
6249,FOCUS.,"school for months. Kind friends have sent her many things."""
6250,FOCUS.,
6251,FOCUS.,"Duff Salter waited a little while, and wrote:"
6252,FOCUS.,
6253,FOCUS.,"""I wish I could leave everybody happy behind me when I go away."""
6254,FOCUS.,
6255,FOCUS.,"""Are you going soon?"""
6256,FOCUS.,
6257,FOCUS.,"""I am going at once,"" wrote Duff Salter with a sudden decision. ""I am"
6258,FOCUS.,"not trusted by anybody here, and my work is over."""
6259,FOCUS.,
6260,FOCUS.,Agnes sat a little while in pain and wistfulness. Finally she wrote:
6261,FOCUS.,
6262,FOCUS.,"""There is but one thing which prevents our perfect trust in you; it is"
6263,FOCUS.,"your distrust of us."""
6264,FOCUS.,
6265,FOCUS.,"""I _am_ distrustful--too much so,"" answered, in writing, the deaf man."
6266,FOCUS.,"""A little suspicion soon overspreads the whole nature, and yet, I think,"
6267,FOCUS.,one can be generous even with suspicion. Among the disciples were a
6268,FOCUS.,"traitor, a liar, a coward, and a doubter; but none upbraid the last,"
6269,FOCUS.,"poor Thomas, and he is sainted in our faith. Do you know that suspicion"
6270,FOCUS.,"made me deaf? Yes; if we mock Nature with distrust, she stops our ears."
6271,FOCUS.,"Do you not remember what happened to Zacharias, the priest? He would not"
6272,FOCUS.,believe the angel who announced that his wife would soon become a
6273,FOCUS.,"mother, and for his unbelief was stricken dumb!"""
6274,FOCUS.,
6275,FOCUS.,"The deaf guest had either stumbled into this illustration, or written it"
6276,FOCUS.,"with full design. He looked at Agnes, and the pale and purple colors"
6277,FOCUS.,came and went upon her face as she bent her body forward over the table.
6278,FOCUS.,"Duff Salter arose and spoke with that lost voice, like one in a vacuum,"
6279,FOCUS.,while he folded his tablet.
6280,FOCUS.,
6281,FOCUS.,"""Agnes,"" he said, ""it has been cruel to a man of such a sceptical soul"
6282,FOCUS.,as mine to educate him back from the faith he had acquired to the
6283,FOCUS.,unfaith he had tried to put behind him. Why did you do it? The
6284,FOCUS.,suppression of the truth is never excusable. The secret you might have
6285,FOCUS.,"scattered with a word, when suspicion started against you, is now"
6286,FOCUS.,"diffused through every family and rendezvous in Kensington."""
6287,FOCUS.,
6288,FOCUS.,"She looked miserable enough, and still received the stab of her guest's"
6289,FOCUS.,magisterial tongue like an affliction from heaven.
6290,FOCUS.,
6291,FOCUS.,"""I had also become infected with this imputation,"" continued Duff"
6292,FOCUS.,"Salter. ""All things around you looked sinister for a season. A kind"
6293,FOCUS.,"Providence has dispelled these black shadows, and I see you now the"
6294,FOCUS.,victim of an immeasurable mistake. Your weakness and another's obstinacy

6318,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6319,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Ringing the bell at the low front step of a two-story brick dwelling,"
6320,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Duff Salter was admitted by Mr. Knox Van de Lear, the proprietor, a"
6321,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"tall, plain, commonplace man, who scarcely bore one feature of his"
6322,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"venerable father. ""Come in, Mr. Salter,"" bellowed Knox, ""tea's just"
6323,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"a-waitin' for you. Pap's here. You know Cal, certain! This is my good"
6324,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"lady, Mrs. Van de Lear. Lottie, put on the oysters and waffles! Don't"
6325,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"forgit the catfish. There's nothing like catfish out of the Delaware,"
6326,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Mr. Salter."""
6327,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6328,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Particularly if they have a corpse or two to flavor them,"" said Calvin"
6329,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,Van de Lear in a low tone.
6330,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6331,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Mrs. Knox Van de Lear, a fine, large, blonde lady, took the head of the"
6332,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"table. She had a sweet, timid voice, quite out of quantity with her bone"
6333,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"and flesh, and her eyelashes seemed to be weak, for they closed together"
6334,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"often and in almost regular time, and the delicate lids were quite as"
6335,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,noticeable as her bashful blue eyes.
6336,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6337,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Lottie,"" said Rev. Silas Van de Lear, ""I came in to-night with a little"
6338,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,chill upon me. At my age chills are the tremors from other wings
6339,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"hovering near. Please let me have the first cup of coffee hot."""
6340,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6341,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Certainly, papa,"" said the hostess, making haste to fill his cup. ""You"
6342,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"don't at all feel apprehensive, do you?"""
6343,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6344,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""No,"" said the old man, with his teeth chattering. ""I haven't had"
6345,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"apprehensions for long back. Nothing but confidence."""
6346,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6347,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Oh, pap!"" put in Knox Van de Lear, ""you'll be a preachin' when I'm a"
6348,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"granddaddy. You never mean to die. Eat a waffle!"""
6349,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6350,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""My children,"" said the old man, ""death is over-due with me. It gives me"
6351,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,no more concern than the last hour shall give all of us. I had hoped to
6352,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,live for three things: to see my new church raised; to see my son Calvin
6353,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"ready to take my place; to see my neighbor, Miss Wilt, whom I have seen"
6354,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"grow up under my eye from childhood, and fair as a lily, brush the dew"
6355,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"of scandal from her skirts and resume her place in our church, the"
6356,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"handmaid of God again."""
6357,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6358,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Amen, old man!"" spoke Calvin irreverently, holding up his plate for"
6359,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,oysters.
6360,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6361,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Why, Cal,"" exclaimed the hostess, closing her delicately-tinted eyelids"
6362,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"till the long lashes rested on the cheek, ""why don't you call papa more"
6363,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"softly?"""
6364,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6365,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""My son,"" spoke the little old gentleman between his chatterings, ""in"
6366,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,the priestly office you must avoid abruptness. Be direct at all
6367,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"important times, but neither familiar nor abrupt. I cannot name for you"
6368,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"a model of address like Agnes Wilt."""
6369,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6370,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Isn't she beautiful!"" said Mrs. Knox. ""Do you think she can be"
6371,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"deceitful, papa?"""
6372,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6373,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""I have no means to pierce the souls of people, Lottie, more than"
6374,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"others. I don't believe she is wicked, but I draw that from my reason"
6375,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,and human faith. That woman was a pillar of strength in my
6376,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,Sabbath-school. May the Lord bring her forth from the furnace refined by
6377,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"fire, and punish them who may have persecuted her!"""
6378,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6379,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Cal is going into a decline on her account,"" said Knox. ""I know it by"
6380,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"seeing him eat waffles. She refused Cal one day, and he came home and"
6381,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"eat all the cold meat in the house."""
6382,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6383,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Mr. Salter,"" the hostess said, raising her voice, ""you have a beautiful"
6384,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"woman for a landlady. Is she well?"""
6385,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6386,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Very melancholy,"" said Duff Salter. ""Why don't you visit her?"""
6387,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6388,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Really,"" said the hostess, ""there is so much feeling against Agnes"
6389,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"that, considering Papa Van de Lear's position in Kensington, I have been"
6390,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"afraid. Agnes is quite too clever for me!"""
6391,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6392,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""I hope she will be,"" said Duff Salter, relapsing to his coffee."
6393,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6394,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""He didn't hear what you said, Lot,"" exclaimed Calvin. ""The old man has"
6395,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"to guess at what we halloo at him."""
6396,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6397,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Have you appraised the estate of the late William Zane?"" asked the"
6398,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"minister, with his bold pulpit voice, which Salter could hear easily."
6399,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6400,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Yes,"" replied the deaf guest. ""It comes out strong. It is worth, clear"
6401,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"of everything and not including doubtful credits, one hundred and eighty"
6402,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"thousand dollars."""
6403,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6404,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""That is the largest estate in Kensington,"" exclaimed the clergyman."
6405,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6406,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""I shall release it all within one week to Miss Agnes,"" said Duff"
6407,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Salter. ""You are too old, Mr. Van de Lear, to manage it. I have finished"
6408,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,my work as co-executor with you. The third executor is Miss Wilt. With
6409,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,the estate in her hands she will change the tone of public opinion in
6410,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Kensington, perhaps, and the fugitive heir must return or receive no"
6411,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"money from the woman he has injured!"""
6412,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6413,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""I am entirely of your opinion,"" said Reverend Mr. Van de Lear. ""Agnes"
6414,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"was independent before; this will make her powerful, and she needs all"
6415,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,the power she can get to meet this insensate suburban opinion. When I
6416,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"was a young man, commencing to minister here, I had rivals enough, and"
6417,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,deeply sympathize with those who must defend themselves against the
6418,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"embattled gossip of a suburban society."""
6419,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6420,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,Mrs. Knox Van de Lear opened and closed her eyes with a saintly sort of
6421,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,resignation.
6422,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6423,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""I am glad for Agnes,"" she said. ""But I fear the courts will not allow"
6424,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"her, suspected as she is, to have the custody of so much wealth that has"
6425,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"descended to her through the misfortunes of others, if not by crimes."""
6426,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6427,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""You are right, Lot,"" said Calvin. ""Her little game may be to get a"
6428,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"husband as soon as she can, who will resist a trustee's appointment by"
6429,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"the courts."""
6430,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6431,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Can _she_ get a husband, Cal?"""
6432,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6433,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Oh, yes! She's lightning! There's old Salter, rich as a Jew. She's"
6434,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,smart enough to capture him and add all he has to all that was coming to
6435,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Andrew Zane."""
6436,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6437,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,Mr. Salter drew up his napkin and sneezed into it a soft articulation of
6438,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Jericho! Jericho!"""
6439,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6440,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Cal, don't you think you have some chance there yet?"" asked Knox Van"
6441,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"de Lear. ""I hoped you would have won Aggy long ago. It's a better show"
6442,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"than I ever had. You see I have to be at work at six o'clock, winter and"
6443,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"summer, and stay at the bookbindery all day long, and so it goes the"
6444,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"year round."""
6445,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6446,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Indeed, it is so!"" exclaimed the hostess, slowly shutting down her"
6447,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"silken lids of pink. ""My poor husband goes away from me while I still"
6448,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"sleep in the dark of dawn; he only returns at supper."""
6449,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6450,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Well, haven't you got brother Cal?"" asked the bookbinder. ""He's better"
6451,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"company than I am, Lottie."""
6452,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6453,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""But Calvin is in love with Miss Wilt,"" said the lady, softly unclosing"
6454,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,her eves.
6455,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6456,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""No,"" coolly remarked Calvin, ""I am not in love with her. You know that,"
6457,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Lottie."""
6458,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6459,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Well, Calvin, dear, you would be if you thought she was pure and clear"
6460,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"of crime."""
6461,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6462,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Don't ask me foolish questions!"" said Calvin."
6463,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6464,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,The lady at the head of the table wore a pretty smile which she shut
6465,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"away under her eyelids again and again, and looked gently at Calvin."
6466,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6467,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Dear Agnes!"" ejaculated Mrs. Knox, ""I never blamed her so much as that"
6468,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"bold little creature, Podge Byerly! No one could make any impression"
6469,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,upon Agnes's confidence until that bright little thing went to board
6470,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"with her. It is so demoralizing to take these working-girls, shop-girls"
6471,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"and school-teachers, in where religious influences had prevailed! They"
6472,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,became inseparable; Agnes had to entertain such company as Miss Byerly
6473,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"brought there, and it produced a lowering of tone. She looked around her"
6474,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"suddenly when these crimes were found out, and all her old mature"
6475,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,friends were gone. It is so sad to lose all the wholesome influences
6476,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"which protect one!"""
6477,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6478,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Duff Salter had been eating his chicken and catfish very gravely, and as"
6479,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,he stopped to sneeze and apologize he noticed that Calvin Van de Lear's
6480,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,face was insolent in its look toward his brother's wife.
6481,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6482,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Wholesome influence,"" said Calvin, ""will return at the news of her"
6483,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"money, quick enough!"""
6484,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6485,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Poor dear Cal!"" exclaimed the lady; ""he is still madly in love!"""
6486,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6487,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""My friends,"" spoke up Duff Salter, ""your father is a very sick man. Let"
6488,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"us take him to a chamber and send for his doctor."""
6489,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6490,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,Mr. Van de Lear had been neglected in this conversation; it was now seen
6491,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"that he was in collapse and deathly pale. He leaned forward, however,"
6492,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"from strong habit, to close the meal with a blessing, and his head fell"
6493,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"forward upon the table. Duff Salter had him in his arms in a moment, and"
6494,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,bore him into the little parlor and placed him on a sofa.
6495,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6496,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Give me some music, children,"" he murmured. ""Oh, my brother Salter! I"
6497,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,would that you could hear with me the rustling sounds I hear in music
6498,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"now! There are voices in it keeping heavenly time, saying, 'Well done!"
6499,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"well done!' My strong, kind brother, let me lean upon your breast. Had"
6500,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,we met in younger days I feel that we would have been very friendly with
6501,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"each other."""
6502,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6503,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Duff Salter already had the meagre little man upon his breast, and his"
6504,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"long, hale beard descended upon the pale and aged face."
6505,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6506,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Mrs. Knox Van de Lear seated herself at the piano and began a hymn, and"
6507,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Calvin Van de Lear accompanied her, singing bass. The old man closed his"
6508,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"eyes on Duff Salter's breast, and Mr. Knox Van de Lear went out softly"
6509,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"to send for a physician. Duff Salter, looking up at a catch in the"
6510,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"singing, saw that Calvin Van de Lear was leaning familiarly on the"
6511,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,lady's shoulder while he turned the leaves of the book of sacred music.
6512,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6513,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""I am very sick,"" said the old clergyman, still shaken by the chills."
6514,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Perhaps we shall meet together no more. My fellow-executor, do my part"
6515,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,in this world! In all my life of serving the church and its Divine
6516,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Master, I have first looked out for the young people. They are most"
6517,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"helpless, most valuable. See that Sister Agnes is mercifully cared for!"
6518,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"If young Andrew Zane returns, deal gently with him too. Let us be kind"
6519,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"to the dear boys, though they go astray. The dear, dear boys!"""
6520,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6521,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Duff Salter received the brave little man's head again upon his breast,"
6522,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,and said to himself:
6523,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6524,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""May God speedily take him away in mercy!"""
6525,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6526,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"The doctor, returning with Knox Van de Lear, commanded the minister to"
6527,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"be instantly removed to a chamber, and Duff Salter, unassisted, walked"
6528,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,up-stairs with him like a father carrying his infant to bed. As they
6529,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"placed the wasted figure away beneath the coverlets, he put his arm"
6530,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,around Duff Salter's neck.
6531,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6532,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Brother,"" he said hoarsely, the chill having him in its grasp, ""God has"
6533,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"blessed you. Can you help my new church?"""
6534,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6535,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""I promise you,"" said Duff Salter, ""that after your people have done"
6536,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"their best I will give the remainder. It shall be built!"""
6537,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6538,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Now, God be praised!"" whispered the dying pastor. ""And let Thy servant"
6539,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"depart in peace."""
6540,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6541,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Amen!"" from somewhere, trembled through the chamber as Duff Salter, his"
6542,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"feet muffled like his voice, in the habit of mute people who walk as"
6543,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"they hear, passed down the stairway."
6544,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6545,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Duff Salter took his seat in the dining-room, which was an extension of"
6546,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Knox Van de Lear's plain parlor, and buried his face in his palms. Years"
6547,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"ago, when a boy, he had attended preaching in Silas Van de Lear's little"
6548,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"chapel, and it touched him deeply that the nestor of the suburb was"
6549,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,about to die; the last of the staunch old pastors of the kirk who had
6550,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,never been silent when liberty was in peril. The times were not the
6551,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"same, and the old man was too brave and simple for the latter half of"
6552,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,his century. As Duff Salter thought of many memories associated with the
6553,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Rev. Silas Van de Lear's residence in Kensington, he heard his own name"
6554,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,mentioned. It was a lady's voice; nothing but acute sensibility could
6555,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,have made it so plain to a deaf man:
6556,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6557,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Husband,"" said the lady with the slumberous eyelids, ""go out with the"
6558,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,pitcher and get us half a gallon of ale. Cal and Mr. Salter and myself
6559,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"are thirsty."""
6560,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6561,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""I have been for the doctor, Lottie; let Cal go."""
6562,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6563,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Cal?"" exclaimed the lady, very quietly raising her lashes. ""It would"
6564,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"not do for him to go for _ale_! He is to be the junior pastor, my dear,"
6565,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"as soon as papa is buried, over the Van de Lear church."""
6566,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6567,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""All right,"" said the tired husband, ""I'll go. We must all back up Cal."""
6568,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6569,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"As soon as the door closed upon Mr. Knox Van de Lear, a kiss resounded"
6570,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"through the little house, and a woman's voice followed it, saying:"
6571,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6572,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Imprudent!"""
6573,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6574,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Oh, bah!"" spoke Calvin Van de Lear. ""Salter is deaf as a post. Lottie,"
6575,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Agnes Wilt has been ruined!"""
6576,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6577,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,In the long pause following this remark the deaf man peeped through his
6578,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,fingers and saw the lady of the house kiss her husband's brother again
6579,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,and again.
6580,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6581,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""I am so glad,"" she whispered. ""Can it be true?"""
6582,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6583,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""It's plain as a barn door. She'll be a mother before shad have run out,"
6584,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"or cherries come in."""
6585,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6586,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""The proud creature! And now, Cal dear, you see nothing exceptionally"
6587,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"saint-like there?"""
6588,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6589,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""I see shame, friendlessness, wealth, and welcome,"" spoke the young man."
6590,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""It's just my luck!"""
6591,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6592,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""But the deaf man? Will he not take her part?"""
6593,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6594,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""No. I shall show him to-night what will cure his partiality. Lottie,"
6595,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"you must let me marry her."""
6596,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6597,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"The large, blonde lady threw back her head until the strong, animal"
6598,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"throat and chin stood sharply defined, and white and scarlet in color as"
6599,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,the lobster's meat.
6600,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6601,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Scoundrel!"" she hissed, clenching Calvin's wrist with an almost"
6602,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,maniacal fury.
6603,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6604,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,At this moment a bell began to toll on the neighboring fire company's
6605,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"house, and Knox Van de Lear entered with the pitcher of ale."
6606,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6607,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""They're tolling the fire bell at the news of father's dying,"" said"
6608,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,Knox.
6609,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6610,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Calvin filled a glass of ale, and exclaimed:"
6611,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6612,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Here's to the next pastor of Kensington!"" as he laughingly drained it"
6613,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,off.
6614,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6615,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Oh, brother Cal!"" remarked the hostess as she softly dropped her"
6616,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"eyelids and smiled reprovingly; ""this irreverence comes of visiting Miss"
6617,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Agnes Wilt too often. I must take you in charge."""
6618,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6619,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,Duff Salter gave a furious sneeze:
6620,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6621,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Jericho! Oh! oh! Jericho!"""
6622,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6623,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,Calvin Van de Lear closed the door between the dining-room and the
6624,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"parlor, and drew Duff Salter's tablets from his pocket and wrote:"
6625,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6626,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""I want you to go up on the house roof with me."""
6627,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6628,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Duff looked at him in surprise, and wrote in reply:"
6629,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6630,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Do you mean to throw me off?"""
6631,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6632,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,Calvin's sallow complexion reddened a very little as he laughed
6633,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"flippantly, and stroked his dry side-whiskers and took the tablets"
6634,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,again:
6635,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6636,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""I want you to see the ghost's walk,"" he wrote. ""Come along!"""
6637,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6638,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,*       *       *       *       *
6639,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6640,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Passing the sick father's door, Calvin led Duff Salter up to the garret"
6641,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"floor, where a room with rag carpet, dumb-bells, boxing-gloves,"
6642,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"theological books, and some pictures far from modest, disclosed the"
6643,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,varied tastes of an entailed pulpit's expectant. Calvin drew down the
6644,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,curtain of the one window and lighted a lamp. There was a table in the
6645,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"middle of the floor, and there the two men conducted a silent"
6646,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,conversation on the ivory tablets.
6647,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6648,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""This is my room,"" wrote Calvin. ""I stay here all day when I study or"
6649,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,enjoy myself. The governor doesn't come in here to give me any advice
6650,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"or nose around."""
6651,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6652,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Is Mrs. Knox Van de Lear serious as to religious matters?"""
6653,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6654,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Very,"" wrote Calvin, sententiously, and looked at Duff Salter with the"
6655,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,most open countenance he had ever been seen to show. Duff merely asked
6656,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,another question:
6657,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6658,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Has she a good handwriting? I want to have a small document very neatly"
6659,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"written."""
6660,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6661,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Calvin went over to a trunk, unlocked it, and took out a bundle of what"
6662,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"appeared to be lady's letters, and selecting one, folded the address"
6663,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,back and showed the chirography.
6664,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6665,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Jericho! Jerry-cho! cho! O cho!"" sneezed Duff Salter. ""The most"
6666,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"admirable writing I have ever seen."""
6667,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6668,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,Calvin took the tablets.
6669,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6670,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""I have been in receipt of some sundry sums of money from you, Salter,"
6671,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,to follow up this Zane mystery. I hope to be able to show you to-night
6672,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"that it has not been misinvested."""
6673,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6674,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""You have had two hundred dollars,"" wrote Duff Salter. ""What are your"

6676,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6677,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Andrew Zane is in Kensington."""
6678,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,

6680,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6681,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""In the block opposite are several houses belonging to the Zane estate."
6682,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"One of them stood empty until within a month, when a tenant unknown to"
6683,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"the neighborhood, with small furniture and effects--evidently a mere"
6684,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,servant--moved in. My brother's wife has taken a deep interest in the
6685,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Zane murder, and being at home all day, her resort is this room, where"
6686,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"she can see, unobserved, the whole _menage_ and movement in the block"
6687,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"opposite."""
6688,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6689,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Why did she feel so much interested?"""
6690,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6691,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Honor bright!"" Calvin wrote. ""Well, Mrs. Knox was a great admirer of"
6692,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,the late William Zane. They were very intimate--some thought under
6693,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"engagement to marry. Suddenly she accepted my brother, and old Zane"
6694,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,turned out to be infatuated with his ward. We may call it rivalry and
6695,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"reminiscence."""
6696,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6697,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Jer-i-choo-wo!"""
6698,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6699,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Duff Salter, now full of smiles, proffered a pinch of snuff to his host,"
6700,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"who declined it, but set out a bottle of brandy in reciprocal"
6701,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,friendship.
6702,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6703,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Go on,"" indicated Salter to the tablets."

6718,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6719,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""It was our inference that probably Andrew Zane was making stealthy"

6723,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6724,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""How could you extract that from a self-contained woman like Agnes"

6726,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6727,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""We got it from Podge Byerly."""
6728,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6729,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Jerusalem!"" exclaimed Duff Salter aloud, knocking over the snuff-box"
6730,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"and forgetting to sneeze. ""Mr. Calvin Van de Lear, it is a damned lie."""
6731,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6732,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,Calvin locked up with some surprise but more conceit.
6733,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6734,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""I'm a first-class eavesdropper,"" he wrote, and held it up on the tablet"
6735,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"to Duff's eyes. ""We got the fact from Podge's bed-ridden brother, a"
6736,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,scamp who destroyed his health by excesses and came back on Podge for
6737,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"support. Knowing how corruptible he was, I got access to him and paid"
6738,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,him out of your funds to wheedle out of Podge all that Lady Agnes told
6739,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"her. She had no idea that her brother communicated with any person, as"
6740,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"he was unable to walk, and she told him for his amusement secrets she"
6741,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,never dreamed could go out of the house. We corresponded with him by

6750,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6751,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,Duff Salter was himself again.
6752,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6753,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Well, Salter,"" continued the heir-apparent of Kensington, ""we laid our"
6754,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"heads together, and the mystery continued to deepen why Andrew Zane"
6755,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,infested the residence of his murdered father if he never revealed
6756,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,himself to the woman he had loved. Not until the discovery that Agnes
6757,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Wilt had been ruined could we make that out."""
6758,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6759,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,They were both looking at each other intently as Duff Salter read the

6761,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6762,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""It then became plain to us,"" continued Calvin, ""that Andrew Zane wanted"
6763,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"to abandon the woman he had seduced, as was perfectly natural. He"
6764,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"haunted and alarmed the house and kept informed on all its happenings,"
6765,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"but cut poor Agnes dead."""
6766,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6767,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""The infamous scoundrel!"" exclaimed Duff Salter, looking very dark and"

6770,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Now, Salter,"" continued Calvin, ""we had a watch set on that ridge of"
6771,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"roofs every night, and another one at the old Zane house, front and"
6772,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"rear, and the apparition on the roof was so irregular that we could not"
6773,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,understand what occasions it took to come out until we observed that
6774,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"whenever your servant was out of the neighborhood a whole night, the"
6775,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"roof-walker was sure to descend into Zane's trap."""
6776,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,

6778,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6779,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""To-night, as we have made ourselves aware, your servant is not in"
6780,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,Kensington. We saw him off to Treaty Island. I am watching at this
6781,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,window for the man on the roof. The moment he leaves the trap-door of the
6782,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"tenant's house, it will be entered by officers at the waving of this"
6783,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,lamp at my window. One officer will proceed along the roof and station
6784,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"himself on the Zane trap, closing that outlet. At the same time the Zane"
6785,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,house will be entered front and rear and searched. The time is due. It
6786,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"is midnight. Come!"""
6787,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6788,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,Calvin pointed to a ladder that led from the corner of his study to the
6789,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"roof, and Duff Salter nodded his head acquiescently."
6790,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6791,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,They went up the ladder and thrust their heads into the soft night of
6792,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,early summer.
6793,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6794,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"There was starlight, but no moon."
6795,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6796,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,The engine bell just ceased to toll as they looked forth on the
6797,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"scattered suburb, and at points beheld the Delaware flowing darkly,"
6798,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"indicated by occasional lights of vessels reflected upward, and by the"
6799,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,very distant lamps on the Camden shore.
6800,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6801,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Most of the houses within the range of vision were small, patched, and"
6802,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"irregular, except where the black walls of the even blocks on some"
6803,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,principal streets strode through.
6804,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6805,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Scarcely a sound, except the tree frogs droning, disturbed the air, and"
6806,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,Kensington basked in the midnight like some sleeping village of the
6807,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"plains, stretching out to the fields of cattle and the savory truck"
6808,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,farms.
6809,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6810,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,Duff Salter mentally exclaimed:
6811,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6812,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Here, like two angels of good or evil, we spy upon the dull old hamlet,"
6813,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,where nothing greater has happened than to-night since the Indians
6814,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,bartered their lands away for things of immediate enjoyment. Are not
6815,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"most of these people Indians still, ready to trade away substantial"
6816,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"lands of antique title for the playthings of a few brief hours? Yes,"
6817,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,heaven itself was signed away by man and woman for the juices of one
6818,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"forbidden fruit. Here, where the good old pastor, like another William"
6819,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Penn, is running his stakes beyond the stars and peopling with angels"
6820,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"his possessions there, the savage children are occupied with the trifles"
6821,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"of lust, covetousness, and deceit. They are no worse than the sons of"
6822,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Penn, who became apostates to his charity and religion before the breath"
6823,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"had left his body. So goes the human race, whether around the Tree of"
6824,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Knowledge or Kensington's Treaty Tree."""
6825,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6826,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Duff Salter felt his arm pulled violently, and heard his companion"
6827,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"whisper,"
6828,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6829,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""There! Do you see it?"""
6830,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6831,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Across the street, only a few hundred feet distant, an object emerged"
6832,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,from the black mass of the buildings and moved rapidly along the
6833,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"opposite ridge of houses against the sky, drawing nearer the two"
6834,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"watchers as it advanced, and passing right opposite."
6835,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6836,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,Duff Salter made it out to be a woman or a figure in a gown.
6837,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6838,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"It looked neither to the right nor left, and did not stoop nor cower,"
6839,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"but strode boldly as if with right to the large residence of the Zanes,"
6840,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,where in a minute it faded away.
6841,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6842,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Duff Salter felt a little superstitious, but Calvin Van de Lear shot"
6843,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,past him down the ladder.
6844,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6845,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,Duff heard the curtain at the window thrown up as the divinity student
6846,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,flashed his lamp and saw the door of the house whence the apparition had
6847,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"come, forced by the police."
6848,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6849,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,As he descended the ladder Calvin Van de Lear extended Duff's hat to
6850,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"him, and pointed across the way."
6851,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6852,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"They were not very prompt reaching the door of the Zane residence, but"
6853,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"were still there in time to employ Duff Salter's key, instead of"
6854,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"violence, to make the entry."
6855,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6856,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Gentlemen,"" said the deaf man, with authority, ""there is no occasion of"
6857,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,any of you pressing in here to alarm a lady. Mr. Van de Lear and myself
6858,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"will make the search of the house which you have already guarded,"
6859,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"front, back, and above, and rendered it impossible for the object of"
6860,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"your warrant to escape."""
6861,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6862,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,The dignity and commanding stature of Duff Salter had their effect.
6863,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6864,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"Calvin Van de Lear and Duff Salter entered the silent house, lighted the"
6865,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"gas, and walked from room to room, finally entering the apartment of"
6866,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,Duff Salter himself.
6867,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6868,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"There sat Mike, the serving-man, in his red hair, uneven eyebrows,"
6869,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"crutch, and wooden leg, as quietly arranging the models of vessels and"
6870,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,steamers as if he had not anticipated a midnight call nor ceased his
6871,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,labor since Duff Salter had gone out.
6872,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6873,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Damnation!"" exclaimed Calvin Van de Lear, pale with exertion and rage,"

6878,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6879,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,Duff Salter walked up to the speaker and seized him by the lapels of his

6882,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,
6883,A REAL ROOF-TREE.,"""Andrew Zane,"" said Duff Salter in a low voice, ""your disguise is"

6934,IN COURT.,
6935,IN COURT.,"""Yes, yes, poor girl! The mother of God braved no less. You can bear it."
6936,IN COURT.,But all this morning I must be closely engaged. An important event

6938,IN COURT.,
6939,IN COURT.,"Agnes was ready, and stepped forth into the daylight on the main"
6940,IN COURT.,thoroughfare of Queen Street. Almost every window was filled with
6941,IN COURT.,"gazers; the sidewalks were lined with strollers, loiterers, and people"
6942,IN COURT.,waiting. She might have fainted if Duff Salter's arm had not been there
6943,IN COURT.,to sustain her.
6944,IN COURT.,
6945,IN COURT.,"A large fishwife, with a basket on her head, was standing beside her"

6954,IN COURT.,
6955,IN COURT.,"A shipbuilder's daughter was on the front steps, a slender girl of dark,"

6958,IN COURT.,
6959,IN COURT.,"Two old women, near neighbors of Agnes, had their spectacles wiped and"
6960,IN COURT.,"run out to a proper focus, and the older of the two had a double pair"
6961,IN COURT.,"upon her most insidious and suspicious nose. As Agnes passed, this old"
6962,IN COURT.,"lady gave such a start that she dropped the spectacles off her nose, and"
6963,IN COURT.,"ejaculated through the open window, ""Lord alive!"""

6965,IN COURT.,"At Knox Van de Lear's house the fine-bodied, feline lady with"
6966,IN COURT.,"nictitating eyes, drew aside the curtain, even while the dying man above"
6967,IN COURT.,"was in frigid waters, that she might slowly raise and drop her ambrosial"
6968,IN COURT.,"lids, and express a refined but not less marked surprise. Agnes, by an"
6969,IN COURT.,"excitement of the nerves of apprehension, saw everything while she"
6970,IN COURT.,trembled. She could read the dates of all the houses on the painted
6971,IN COURT.,"cornices of the water-spouts, and saw the cabalistic devices of old"
6972,IN COURT.,insurance companies on the property they covered. Pigeons flying about
6973,IN COURT.,the low roofs clucked and chuckled as if their milky purity had been
6974,IN COURT.,"incensed, and little dogs seemed to draw near and trot after, too"
6975,IN COURT.,"familiarly, as if they scented sin."
6976,IN COURT.,
6977,IN COURT.,There were two working-men from Zane & Rainey's ship-yard who had known

6992,IN COURT.,
6993,IN COURT.,So excited were the sensibilities of Agnes that it seemed to her the old
6994,IN COURT.,door-knockers squinted; the idle writing of boys on dead walls read with
6995,IN COURT.,a hidden meaning; the shade-trees lazily shaking in summer seemed to
6996,IN COURT.,"whisper; if she looked down, there now and then appeared, moulded in the"
6997,IN COURT.,"bricks of the pavement, a worn letter, or a passing goose foot, the"
6998,IN COURT.,"accident of the brickyard, but now become personal and intentional. The"
6999,IN COURT.,"little babies, sporting in their carriages before some houses, leaned"
7000,IN COURT.,forward and looked as wise and awful as doctors in some occult
7001,IN COURT.,"diagnosis. Cartwheels, as they struck hard, articulated, ""What, out!"
7002,IN COURT.,"Boo! boohoo!"" Sunshine all slanted her way. Hucksters' cries sounded"
7003,IN COURT.,"like constables' proclamation: ""Oyez! oyez!"""

7005,IN COURT.,"With the perceptions, the reflections of Agnes were also startlingly"
7006,IN COURT.,alert. She seemed two or three unfortunate people at once. Now it was
7007,IN COURT.,Lady Jane Grey going to the tower. Now it was Beatrice Cenci going to
7008,IN COURT.,torture. Now it was Mary Magdalene going to the cross. At almost every
7009,IN COURT.,"house she felt a kindness speak for her, except mankind; a recollection"
7010,IN COURT.,"of nursing, comforting, praying with some one, but all forgotten now."
7011,IN COURT.,"""_Via Crucia, Via Crucia_,"" her thorn-torn feet seemed to patter in the"
7012,IN COURT.,"echoes of her ears and mind, and there arose upon her spirit the"
7013,IN COURT.,"sternest curse of women, direful with God's own rage, ""I will greatly"
7014,IN COURT.,"multiply thy sorrow and thy conception."""
7015,IN COURT.,
7016,IN COURT.,"Thus she reached the magistrate's little office, around the door of"
7017,IN COURT.,"which was a little crowd of people, and Duff Salter led her in the"
7018,IN COURT.,private door to the residence itself. A cup of tea and a decanter of
7019,IN COURT.,"wine were on the table. The magistrate's wife knew her, and kissed her."
7020,IN COURT.,Then Agnes broke down and wept like a little child.
7021,IN COURT.,
7022,IN COURT.,"The magistrate was a lame man, and a deacon in Van de Lear's church,"
7023,IN COURT.,"quite gray, and both prudent and austere, and making use of but few"
7024,IN COURT.,"words, so that there was no way of determining his feelings on the case."
7025,IN COURT.,"He took his place behind a plain table and opened court by saying,"
7026,IN COURT.,
7027,IN COURT.,"""Who appears? Now!"""
7028,IN COURT.,
7029,IN COURT.,"Duff Salter rose, the largest man in the court-room. His long beard"
7030,IN COURT.,"covered his whole breast-bone; his fine intelligent features, clear,"
7031,IN COURT.,"sober eyes, and hale, house-bleached skin, bore out the authority"
7032,IN COURT.,conceded to him in Kensington as a rich gentleman of the world.
7033,IN COURT.,
7034,IN COURT.,"""Mr. Magistrate,"" said Duff Salter, ""this examination concerns the"
7035,IN COURT.,public and the ends of justice only as bears upon the death of the late
7036,IN COURT.,"citizens of Kensington, William Zane and Saylor Rainey. It is a"
7037,IN COURT.,"preliminary examination only, and the person suspected by public gossip"
7038,IN COURT.,"has not retained counsel. With your permission, as the executor of"
7039,IN COURT.,"William Zane, I will conduct such part of the inquiry here as my duty"
7040,IN COURT.,"toward the deceased, and my knowledge of the evidence, notwithstanding"
7041,IN COURT.,"my frontier notions of law, suggest to me."""
7042,IN COURT.,
7043,IN COURT.,"""You prosecute?"" asked the magistrate, and added, ""Yes, yes! I will!"""
7044,IN COURT.,
7045,IN COURT.,Calvin Van de Lear got up and bowed to the magistrate.
7046,IN COURT.,
7047,IN COURT.,"""Your Honor, my deep interest in Miss Agnes Wilt has driven me to leave"
7048,IN COURT.,the bedside of a dying parent to see that her interests are properly
7049,IN COURT.,attended to in this case. Whenever she is concerned I am for the
7050,IN COURT.,"defence."""
7051,IN COURT.,
7052,IN COURT.,"""Yes!"" exclaimed the magistrate. ""Salter, have you a witness?"""
7053,IN COURT.,
7054,IN COURT.,"""Mike Donovan!"" called Duff Salter."
7055,IN COURT.,
7056,IN COURT.,"A red-haired Irishman, with one eyebrow higher than the other, and scars"
7057,IN COURT.,"on his face, walked into the alderman's court from the private room, and"
7058,IN COURT.,was sworn.

7060,IN COURT.,"""Donovan,"" spoke Duff Salter, standing up, ""relate the occurrences of a"
7061,IN COURT.,"certain night when you rowed the prisoner, Andrew Zane, and certain"
7062,IN COURT.,"other persons, from Treaty Island to an uncertain point in the River"
7063,IN COURT.,"Delaware."""
7064,IN COURT.,
7065,IN COURT.,"""Stop! stop!"" exclaimed Calvin Van de Lear, rising. ""It seems to me I"
7066,IN COURT.,"have seen that fellow's face before. Donovan, hadn't you a wooden leg"
7067,IN COURT.,"when last I saw you?"""
7068,IN COURT.,
7069,IN COURT.,"""No doubt of it,"" answered the Irishman."
7070,IN COURT.,
7071,IN COURT.,"""Why haven't you got it on now?"" cried Calvin, scowling."
7072,IN COURT.,
7073,IN COURT.,"""Because, yer riverence, me own legs was plenty good enough on this"
7074,IN COURT.,"occasion."""
7075,IN COURT.,
7076,IN COURT.,"""Now, now, I won't!"" ordered the sententious little magistrate."
7077,IN COURT.,
7078,IN COURT.,"""Proceed with the narrative,"" cried Duff Salter, ""and repeat no part of"
7079,IN COURT.,"the conversation in that boat."""
7080,IN COURT.,
7081,IN COURT.,"""It was a dark and lowering night,"" said the waterman, ""as we swung"
7082,IN COURT.,"loose from Traity Isle. I sat a little forward of the cintre, managing"
7083,IN COURT.,"the oars. Mr. Andrew Zane was in the bow, on the watch for difficulties."
7084,IN COURT.,"In the stern sat the boss, Mr. William Zane. Between him and me--God's"
7085,IN COURT.,"rest to him!--sat the murdered gintleman, well-beloved Saylor Rainey!"
7086,IN COURT.,The tide was running six miles an hour. We steered by the lights of
7087,IN COURT.,"Kinsington."""
7088,IN COURT.,
7089,IN COURT.,"""Then you are confident,"" said Duff Salter, ""that the whole length of"
7090,IN COURT.,"the skiff separated William Zane from his son?"""
7091,IN COURT.,
7092,IN COURT.,"""As confident, yer honor, as that the batteau had two inds. They niver"
7093,IN COURT.,"were nearer, the one to the tother, than that, for the whole of the"
7094,IN COURT.,ixpidition. And scarcely one word did Mr. Andrew utter on the whole ov
7095,IN COURT.,"that bloody passage."""
7096,IN COURT.,
7097,IN COURT.,"""Say nothing, for the present, about any conversations,"" commanded Duff"
7098,IN COURT.,"Salter, ""but go on with the occurrences briefly."""
7099,IN COURT.,
7100,IN COURT.,"""I had been a very little while, ye must understand me, gintlemen, in"
7101,IN COURT.,the imploy of thim two partners. After they entered the boat they spoke
7102,IN COURT.,"nothing at all, at all, for siveral minutes. It was all I could do wid"
7103,IN COURT.,"the strong tide to keep the boat pinted for Kinsington, and I only"
7104,IN COURT.,noticed that Mr. Rainey comminced the conversation in a low tone of
7105,IN COURT.,"voice. Just at that time, or soon afterward, your Honor, a large vessel"
7106,IN COURT.,"stood across our bow, going down stream in the night, and I put on all"
7107,IN COURT.,"my strength, at Mr. William Zane's order, to cross in front of her, and"
7108,IN COURT.,did so. I was so afraid the ship would take us under that I put my whole
7109,IN COURT.,"attintion to my task, not daring to disobey so positive a boss as Mr."
7110,IN COURT.,"Zane, though it was agin my judgment, indade."""
7111,IN COURT.,
7112,IN COURT.,All in the court and outside the door and windows were giving strict
7113,IN COURT.,"attention. Even Andrew Zane, whose face had been rather sullen, listened"
7114,IN COURT.,with a pale spot on his cheeks.
7115,IN COURT.,
7116,IN COURT.,"""Go on,"" said Duff Salter gently. ""You relate it very well."""
7117,IN COURT.,
7118,IN COURT.,"""As we had cleared the ship, gintlemen, I paused an instant to wipe the"
7119,IN COURT.,"sweat from my brows, though it was a cold night, for I was quite spint."
7120,IN COURT.,I then perceived that Mr. Rainey and the master were disputing and
7121,IN COURT.,"raising their voices higher and higher, and what surprised me most of"
7122,IN COURT.,"all, your Honor, was the unusual firmness of Mr. Rainey, who was"
7123,IN COURT.,"ginerally very obedient to the boss. He faced the boss, and would not"
7124,IN COURT.,"take his orders, and I heard him once exclaim: 'Shame on you, sir; he is"
7125,IN COURT.,"your son!'"""
7126,IN COURT.,
7127,IN COURT.,"""Stop! stop!"" cried Duff Salter. ""You were not to repeat conversations."
7128,IN COURT.,"What next?"""
7129,IN COURT.,
7130,IN COURT.,"""In the twinklin' of an eye,"" resumed the witness, ""the masther had"
7131,IN COURT.,sazed his partner by the throat and called him a villain. They both
7132,IN COURT.,"stood up in the boat, the masther's hand still in Mr. Rainey's collar,"
7133,IN COURT.,"and for an instant Mr. Rainey shook himself loose and cried--"""
7134,IN COURT.,
7135,IN COURT.,"""Not a word!"" exclaimed Duff Salter. ""What was _done_?"""
7136,IN COURT.,
7137,IN COURT.,"""Mr. Rainey cried out something, all at once. The masther fetched a"
7138,IN COURT.,terrible oath and fell back upon his seat. 'You assisted in this
7139,IN COURT.,"villainy!' he shouted. They clinched, and I saw something shine dimly in"
7140,IN COURT.,Mr. William Zane's hand. The report told me what it was. I lifted one
7141,IN COURT.,"oar in a feeling of horror, and the boat swung round abruptly on the"
7142,IN COURT.,"blade of the other, and Mr. Rainey, released from the masther's grip,"
7143,IN COURT.,"fell overboard in the dark night."""
7144,IN COURT.,
7145,IN COURT.,"Nothing was said by any person in the court except a suppressed ""Bah!"""
7146,IN COURT.,from Calvin Van de Lear.
7147,IN COURT.,
7148,IN COURT.,"""Silence! Order! I won't!"" exclaimed the lame magistrate, rising from"
7149,IN COURT.,"his seat. ""Now! Go on!"""
7150,IN COURT.,
7151,IN COURT.,"""I dropped both oars in me terror, and one of them floated away in the"
7152,IN COURT.,"dark. We all stood up in the boat. 'My God!' exclaimed the masther,"
7153,IN COURT.,'what have I done?' As quick as the beating of my heart he placed the
7154,IN COURT.,pistol at his own head. I saw the flash and heard the report. Mr.
7155,IN COURT.,"William Zane fell overboard."""
7156,IN COURT.,
7157,IN COURT.,"There was a shudder of horror for a moment, and then a voice outside the"
7158,IN COURT.,"window, hoarse and cheery, shouted to the outer crowd, ""Andrew is"
7159,IN COURT.,"innocent! Three cheers for Andrew Zane!"""
7160,IN COURT.,
7161,IN COURT.,The people in and out of the warm and densely-pressed office
7162,IN COURT.,"simultaneously gave cheers, calling others to the scene, and the old"
7163,IN COURT.,"magistrate, lame as he was, arose and looked happy."
7164,IN COURT.,
7165,IN COURT.,"""No arrests!"" he cried. ""Right enough! Good! Now, attention!"""
7166,IN COURT.,
7167,IN COURT.,"But Andrew Zane kept his seat with an expression of obstinacy, and"
7168,IN COURT.,"glared at Calvin Van de Lear, who was trembling with rage."
7169,IN COURT.,
7170,IN COURT.,"""Well got up, on my word!"" exclaimed Calvin. ""Who is this fellow?"""
7171,IN COURT.,
7172,IN COURT.,"""Go on and finish your story!"" commanded Duff Salter."
7173,IN COURT.,
7174,IN COURT.,"""God forgive Mike Donovan, your Honor!"" continued the witness. ""I'm"
7175,IN COURT.,afraid if Mr. William Zane had been the only man overboard I wouldn't
7176,IN COURT.,"have risked me life. He was a hard, overbearin' masther. But I thought"
7177,IN COURT.,"of his poor son, standin' paralyzed-like, and the kind Mr. Rainey"
7178,IN COURT.,"drownin' in the wintry water, and I jumped down in the dark flood to"
7179,IN COURT.,"rescue one or both. From that day to this, the two partners I never saw."
7180,IN COURT.,"It was months before I saw America at all, or the survivin' okkepant of"
7181,IN COURT.,"the boat."""
7182,IN COURT.,
7183,IN COURT.,"""You may explain how that came to be,"" intimated Duff Salter, grimly"
7184,IN COURT.,superintending the court.
7185,IN COURT.,
7186,IN COURT.,"""Well, sir! As I dived from the skiff my head encountered a solid"
7187,IN COURT.,something which made me see a thousand flashes av lightning in one
7188,IN COURT.,second. I was so stunned that I had only instinct--I belave ye call it
7189,IN COURT.,that--to throw my ar-rum around the murthering object and hold like
7190,IN COURT.,"death. Ye know, judge, how drownin' men will hold to straws. That straw,"
7191,IN COURT.,"yer Honor, was the spar of a vessel movin' through the water. It was, I"
7192,IN COURT.,"found out afterward, one of the pieces which had wedged the ship on the"
7193,IN COURT.,"Marine Railway, where she had been gettin' repaired, and she comin' off"
7194,IN COURT.,"hurriedly about dusk, had not been loosened from her. I raised my voice"
7195,IN COURT.,"by a despairin' effort, and screamed 'Help! help!' When I came to I was"
7196,IN COURT.,"on an Austrian merchant ship, bound to Wilmington, North Carolina, for"
7197,IN COURT.,"naval stores, and then to Trieste. The blow of the spar had given me a"
7198,IN COURT.,"slight crack av the skull."""
7199,IN COURT.,
7200,IN COURT.,"""That crack is wide open yet,"" said Calvin Van de Lear."
7201,IN COURT.,
7202,IN COURT.,"""Begorra,"" returned the Irishman, facing placidly around until he found"
7203,IN COURT.,"the owner of the voice, ""Mr. Calvin Van de Lear, it would take many such"

7205,IN COURT.,
7206,IN COURT.,"""Go on now, Donovan, and finish your tale. You were carried off to"
7207,IN COURT.,"Trieste?"" spoke Duff Salter."
7208,IN COURT.,
7209,IN COURT.,"""I was, sir. At Wilmington no news had been recaved of any tragedy in"
7210,IN COURT.,"Philadelphia, and when I told my story there to a gentleman he concluded"
7211,IN COURT.,"I was ravin' and a seein' delusions. The Austrian was short av a crew,"
7212,IN COURT.,and the docthor said if they could get away to sea he could make me
7213,IN COURT.,effective very soon. I was too helpless to go on deck or make
7214,IN COURT.,"resistance. Says I, 'It's the will av God.'"""
7215,IN COURT.,
7216,IN COURT.,"A round of applause greeted this story as it was ended, and cheerful"
7217,IN COURT.,"hands were extended to the witness and the prisoner. Calvin Van de Lear,"
7218,IN COURT.,"however, exclaimed:"
7219,IN COURT.,
7220,IN COURT.,"""Alderman, what has all this to do with the prisoner's ignominious"
7221,IN COURT.,flight for months from his home and from persons he abandoned to
7222,IN COURT.,"suspicion and shame? This man is an impostor."""
7223,IN COURT.,
7224,IN COURT.,"""Will you take the stand, Mr. Andrew Zane?"" asked Duff Salter."
7225,IN COURT.,
7226,IN COURT.,"""No,"" replied the late fugitive. ""I have been hunted and slandered like"
7227,IN COURT.,"a wolf. I will give no evidence in Kensington, where I have been so"
7228,IN COURT.,"shamefully treated. Let me be sent to a higher court, and there I will"
7229,IN COURT.,"speak."""
7230,IN COURT.,
7231,IN COURT.,"""Alas!"" Duff Salter said, with grave emphasis, ""it is you father's old"
7232,IN COURT.,and obstinate spirit which is speaking. You are the ghost I thought was
7233,IN COURT.,"his at the door of my chamber. Mr. Magistrate, swear me!"""
7234,IN COURT.,
7235,IN COURT.,"Duff Salter gravely kissed the Testament and stood ready to depose, when"
7236,IN COURT.,Calvin Van de Lear again interrupted.
7237,IN COURT.,
7238,IN COURT.,"""Are you not deaf?"" asked the divinity student. ""Where are your tablets"
7239,IN COURT.,"that you carry every day? You seem to hear too well, I consider."""
7240,IN COURT.,
7241,IN COURT.,"""You are right,"" cried Duff Salter, turning on his interrogator like a"
7242,IN COURT.,"lion. ""I am wholly cured of deafness, and my memory is as acute as my"
7243,IN COURT.,"hearing."""
7244,IN COURT.,
7245,IN COURT.,"Calvin Van de Lear turned pale to the roots of his dry, yellow whiskers."
7246,IN COURT.,
7247,IN COURT.,"""Devil!"" he muttered."
7248,IN COURT.,
7249,IN COURT.,"""My testimony covers only a single point,"" resumed the strong, direct,"
7250,IN COURT.,"and imposing witness. ""I saw the face of this prisoner for the first"
7251,IN COURT.,time since his babyhood in his father's house not many weeks ago. It
7252,IN COURT.,"resembled his father's youthful countenance, as I knew it, so greatly"
7253,IN COURT.,"that I really believed his parent haunted the streets of Kensington,"
7254,IN COURT.,according to the rumor. The supposed apparition drove me to investigate
7255,IN COURT.,the mysterious death of William Zane. I believed that Agnes knew the
7256,IN COURT.,"story, but was under this prisoner's command of secrecy. Seeking an"
7257,IN COURT.,"assistant, the witness, Donovan, forced himself upon me. In a short time"
7258,IN COURT.,I was confounded by the contradictions of his behavior. Looking deeper
7259,IN COURT.,"into it, I suspected that in his suit of clothing resided at different"
7260,IN COURT.,"times two men: the one an agent, the other a principal; the one a"
7261,IN COURT.,"reality, the other a disguise. I armed myself and had the duller and"
7262,IN COURT.,less observant of these doubles row me out upon the Delaware on such a
7263,IN COURT.,night as marked the tragedy he witnessed. When we reached the middle of
7264,IN COURT.,the river I forced the story of the coincidence from him by reasoning
7265,IN COURT.,"and threats."""
7266,IN COURT.,
7267,IN COURT.,"""Ha! ha!"" exclaimed Calvin Van de Lear. ""Is this an Arkansas snake"
7268,IN COURT.,"story?"""
7269,IN COURT.,
7270,IN COURT.,"""The young Zane had gratified a wilful passion to penetrate the"
7271,IN COURT.,"residence of his father, and look at its inmates and the situation from"
7272,IN COURT.,safe harborage there. He found that Donovan in his roving sailor's life
7273,IN COURT.,"had played the crippled sea beggar in the streets of British cities,"
7274,IN COURT.,tying up his natural leg and fitting a wooden leg to the knee--a trick
7275,IN COURT.,well known to British ballad singers. That leg was in Donovan's
7276,IN COURT.,"sea-chest, as it had been left in this city, and also the crutch"
7277,IN COURT.,necessary to walk with it. Mr. Zane and Donovan had exchanged the leg
7278,IN COURT.,"and crutch, and the former matched his fellow with a wig and patches."
7279,IN COURT.,"Thus convertible, they had for a little while deceived everybody, but"
7280,IN COURT.,for further convenience Mr. Zane ensconced himself as a tenant in a
7281,IN COURT.,"neighboring house, and when the apparatus was in request by Donovan, he"
7282,IN COURT.,"crossed on the roofs between the trap-doors, and still was master of his"
7283,IN COURT.,"residence."""
7284,IN COURT.,
7285,IN COURT.,"""What does all this disclose but the intrigue of despairing guilt?"""
7286,IN COURT.,"exclaimed young Van de Lear. ""He had destroyed the purity of a lady and"
7287,IN COURT.,"abandoned her, and was afraid to show his real face in Kensington."""
7288,IN COURT.,
7289,IN COURT.,"""We will see as to that,"" replied Duff Salter. ""I had hoped to respect"
7290,IN COURT.,"the lady's privacy, but Mr. Zane has refused to testify. Call Agnes"

7292,IN COURT.,
7293,IN COURT.,"All in the magistrate's office rose at the mention of this name, only"
7294,IN COURT.,Andrew Zane keeping his seat amid the crowd. Calvin Van de Lear
7295,IN COURT.,"officiously sought to assist the witness in, but Duff Salter pressed him"
7296,IN COURT.,"back and gave the sad and beautiful woman his arm. She was sworn, and"
7297,IN COURT.,stood there blushing and pale by turns.
7298,IN COURT.,
7299,IN COURT.,"""What is your name?"" asked Duff Salter gently. ""Speak very plain, so"
7300,IN COURT.,"that all these good friends of yours may make no mistake."""

7369,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"The physician said the good man's pulse ceased to beat at that minute,"
7370,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,and they raised around his scarcely cold remains a hymn to heaven.
7371,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7372,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"Mean time, at the alderman's court, a surprising scene was witnessed."
7373,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"For a few minutes everybody was in a frenzy of delight, and Duff Salter"
7374,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,was the hero of the hour. The alderman made no effort to discipline any
7375,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"person; people hugged and laughed, and entreated to shake hands with"
7376,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"Andrew Zane, and in the pleasing confusion Calvin Van de Lear slunk out,"
7377,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,white as one condemned to be whipped.
7378,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7379,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""Now! now! We will! Yes!"" said the sententious old alderman. ""Come to"
7380,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"order. Andrew Zane must be sworn!"""
7381,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7382,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,At this moment the Kensington volunteer fire apparatus stopped opposite
7383,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,the alderman's office and began to peal its bells merrily. The young
7384,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"husband's obstinacy slowly giving way, seemed to be gone entirely when,"
7385,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"searching the room with his eye, he detected the flight of Calvin Van de"
7386,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"Lear. He kissed the little book as if it were a box of divine balm, and"
7387,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"raised his voice, looking still tenderly at Agnes, and addressing Duff"
7388,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,Salter:
7389,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7390,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""Will you examine me, my father's friend?"""
7391,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7392,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""Yes, now! You will!"" exploded the alderman."
7393,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7394,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""No, take your own method, thou alternate of the late Mike Donovan,"""
7395,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,exclaimed Duff Salter with a smile.
7396,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7397,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""I never thought there could be an excuse for my behavior,"" said Andrew"
7398,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"Zane, ""until this unexpected kind treatment had encouraged me. Indeed,"
7399,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"my friends, I am in every alternative unfortunate. To defend myself I"
7400,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"must reflect upon the dead. I will not make a defence, but tell my story"
7401,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,plainly.
7402,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7403,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""My father was a man of deeds--a kind, rude business man. He loved me"
7404,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"and I worshipped him, though our apposite tempers frequently brought us"
7405,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,in conflict. Neither of us knew how to curb the other or be curbed in
7406,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,turn. Above all things I learned to fear my father's will; it was
7407,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,invincible.
7408,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7409,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""My wife and I grew up in my widower father's family, and fell in love,"
7410,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,and had an understanding that at a proper season we would marry. That
7411,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,season could not be long postponed when Agnes's increasing beauty and my
7412,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,ardor kept pace together. I sought an occasion to break the secret to my
7413,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"father, and his reception of it filled me with terror. 'Marry Agnes!'"
7414,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,he replied. 'You have no right to her. Your mother left her to me. I
7415,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,may marry her myself.'
7416,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7417,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""If he had never formed this design before it was now pursued with his"
7418,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,well-known tireless energy. The suggestion needed no other encouragement
7419,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"than her beauty, ever present to inflame us both. Her household habits"
7420,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,and society were to his liking; he offered me everything but that which
7421,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,embraced all to me. 'Go to Europe!' he said. 'Take a wife where you
7422,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"will; but Agnes you shall not have. I will give you money, pleasure, and"
7423,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"independence, but I love where you have looked. Agnes will be your"
7424,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"mother, not your wife!'"
7425,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7426,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""Alas! gentlemen, this purpose of my father was not mere tyranny; he"
7427,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"loved her, indeed, and that was the insurmountable fact. My betrothed"
7428,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,had too much reason to know it. We mingled our tears together and
7429,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"acknowledged our dependence and duty, but we loved with that youthful"
7430,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,fulness which cannot be mistaken nor dissuaded. In our distress we went
7431,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,to that kind partner whom my father had raised from an apprentice to be
7432,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"his equal, and asked him what to do. He told us to marry while we could."
7433,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"Agnes preferred an open marriage as least in consequences, and involving"
7434,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,every trouble in the brave outset. I hoped to wean my father from his
7435,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"wilfulness, and yet protect my affection by a secret marriage, to which"
7436,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,with difficulty I prevailed on my betrothed to consent. After our
7437,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,marriage I found my husband's domain no less invaded by my father's
7438,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"suit, until life became intolerable and it was necessary to speak. Poor,"
7439,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"brave Rainey, feeling keenly for us, fixed the time and place. He had"
7440,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"seldom crossed my father, and I trembled for his safety, but never"
7441,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,could have anticipated what came to pass.
7442,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7443,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""Mr. Rainey said to us, 'I will tell your father, while we are crossing"
7444,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"the river some evening in a batteau, that you and Agnes are married, and"
7445,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,his suit is fruitless. He will be unable to do worse than sit still and
7446,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"bear it in the small limits of the boat, and before we touch the other"
7447,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,shore will get philosophy from time and consideration.'
7448,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7449,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""That plan was carried out. Shall I recount the dreadful circumstances"
7450,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"again? Spare me, I entreat you!"""
7451,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7452,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""No, I won't! The whole truth!"" exclaimed the stern magistrate. ""Tell"
7453,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"it!"""
7454,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7455,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""You are making no mistake, my young friend,"" said Duff Salter. ""It will"
7456,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"all be told very soon."""
7457,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7458,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""As we started from Treaty Island, on that dark winter night,"" continued"
7459,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"Andrew Zane, growing pale while he spoke, ""Mr. Rainey said to me, 'Go in"
7460,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,the bow. You are not to speak one word. I will face your father astern.'
7461,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"The oarsman, Donovan, had a hard pull. The first word I heard my father"
7462,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"say was, 'That is none of your affair.' 'It is everybody's affair,'"
7463,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"answered Mr. Rainey, 'because you make it so. Behave like a gentleman"
7464,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,and a parent. The young people love each other.' 'I have the young
7465,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"lady's affections,' said my father. 'You are making her miserable,' said"
7466,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"Mr. Rainey, 'and are deceiving yourself. She begins to hate you.' 'You"
7467,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,are an insolent liar!' exclaimed my father. 'If you mix in this business
7468,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"I will throw you out of the firm.' 'That is no intimidation to me,'"
7469,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,answered his partner. 'Prosperity can never attend the business of a
7470,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,cruel and unjust man. I shall be a brother to Andrew and a father to
7471,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"Agnes, since you would defraud them so. William Zane, I will see them"
7472,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,married and supported!' With that my father threw himself in mere
7473,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"physical rage upon Mr. Rainey. They both arose, and Mr. Rainey shook"
7474,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"himself loose and cried, 'You are outwitted, partner. I saw them"
7475,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,married! They are man and wife!'
7476,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7477,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""With this my father's rage had no expression short of recklessness. He"
7478,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"always carried arms, and was unconquerable. His ready hand had sought"
7479,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"his weapon, I think, hardly consciously. His dismay and indignation for"
7480,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,an instant destroyed his reason at Mr. Rainey's sudden statement of
7481,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,fact.
7482,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7483,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""My God! can I further particularize on such a scene? In a moment of"
7484,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"time I saw before my eyes a homicide of insanity, a suicide of remorse;"
7485,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"and to end all, the sailor in the boat, as if set crazy by these"
7486,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"occurrences, leaped overboard also."""
7487,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7488,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"This narrative, given with rising energy of feeling by Andrew Zane, was"
7489,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"heard with breathless attention. Andrew paused and glanced at his wife,"
7490,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,whose face was bathed with the inner light of perfect relief. The
7491,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,greater babe of secrecy had ceased to travail with her.
7492,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7493,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""Mr. Magistrate,"" said the young husband, ""as I am under my oath, I can"
7494,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,only relate the acts which followed from the inference of my feelings.
7495,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,My first sense was that of astonishment too intense not to appear unreal
7496,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,and even amusing. It seemed to me that if I would laugh out loud all
7497,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"would come back, as delusions yield to scepticism and mockery. But it"
7498,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"was too cold not to be real, the scene and persons were too familiar to"
7499,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,be erroneous. I had to realize that I was in one of the great and
7500,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,terrible occasional convulsions of human nature. Do you know how it next
7501,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"affected me? With an instant's sense of sublimity! I said to myself,"
7502,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"'How dared I marry so much beauty and womanly majesty? Doing so, I have"
7503,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,tempted the old gods and their fates and furies. This is poetical
7504,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,punishment for my temerity.' Still all the while I was laboring at the
7505,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"one scull left in the boat while my brain was fuming so, and listening"
7506,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"for sounds on the water. I heard the sailor cry twice, and then his"
7507,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"voice fainted away. I began to weep at the oar while I strained upon it,"
7508,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,and called 'Help!' and implored God's intervention. At last I sat down
7509,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"in the boat, worn out and in despair, and let it drift down all the"
7510,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"city's front, past lights and glooms and floating ice, and wished that I"
7511,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"were dead. My father's kindness and all our disagreements rose to mind,"
7512,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,and it seemed God's punishment that I had married where his intentions
7513,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"were. Yet to know the truth of this, I said a prayer upon my knees in"
7514,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"the wet boat while my teeth chattered, and before the end of my prayer"
7515,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"had come I was thinking of my wife's pure name, and how this would spot"
7516,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,her as with stains of blood unless I could explain it.
7517,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7518,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""When I reached this stage of my exalted sensibilities I was nearly"
7519,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"crazed. There had been no witness of our marriage except the minister,"
7520,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,and he was already dead. We had been married at the country parsonage of
7521,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"an old retired minister beyond Oxford church, on the road from Frankford"
7522,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"town, as we drove out one afternoon, and I prevailed with my"
7523,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,conscientious wife to yield her scruples to our heart's necessity.
7524,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,'Great God!' I thought aloud--for none could hear me there--'how
7525,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,dreadfully that secret marriage will compromise my wife! Who will
7526,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,believe us without a witness of what I must assert--a story so
7527,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,improbable that I would not believe it myself? I must say that I married
7528,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"my wife secretly from my father's house, confessing deceit for both of"
7529,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"us, and with Agnes's religious professions, a sin in the church's"
7530,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"estimation. If there could be an excuse for me, the strict people of"
7531,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,Kensington will accord none to her. They will charge on her maturer mind
7532,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"the whole responsibility, paint her in the colors of ingratitude, and"
7533,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"find in her greatest poverty the principal motive. Yes, they may be"
7534,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"wicked enough to say she compassed the death of my father by my hands,"
7535,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,to get his property.'
7536,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7537,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""I had proceeded thus far when the terror of our position became"
7538,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"luminous like the coming fire on a prairie, which shows everything but a"
7539,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,way of escape. 'Where is your father?' they would ask of me in
7540,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,Kensington. 'He is drowned.' 'How drowned?' 'He shot himself.' 'Why did
7541,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,he shoot himself?' 'Because I had married his ward.' 'But his partner is
7542,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,gone too.' 'He is murdered.' 'Why murdered?' 'Because he interceded for
7543,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,me.' 'Where is your witness?' 'He has disappeared.' I saw the wild
7544,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"improbability of this tale, and thought of past notorious quarrels with"
7545,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,my father ended by my voluntary absence. There were but two points that
7546,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,seemed to stick in my nervous mind: 'It never would do to tell our
7547,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"marriage at that moment, and I must find that sailor, who might still be"
7548,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"living.'"""
7549,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7550,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""He found me, sure enough, begorra!"" exclaimed Mike Donovan, giving the"
7551,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,relief of laughter to that intense narrative.
7552,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7553,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""Cowardly as you may call my resolution, gentlemen, it was all the"
7554,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,resolution I had left. To partake of the inheritance left me by both
7555,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,partners in our house I feared to do. 'Let us do the penance of
7556,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"suspicious separation,' I said to Agnes; 'as your husband I command you"
7557,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"to let me go!' She yielded like a wife, and stood my hostage in"
7558,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,Kensington for all those melancholy months. I had just learned the place
7559,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"for which the bark which passed us on that eventful night had cleared,"
7560,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,when the two bullet-pierced bodies were discovered in the ice. That
7561,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"night I sailed for Wilmington, North Carolina. When I arrived there the"
7562,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"bark was gone for the Mediterranean, but I heard of my sailor, wounded,"
7563,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"in her hospital. I sailed from Charleston for Cuba, and from Cuba to"
7564,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"Cadiz, and thence I embarked for Trieste. At Trieste I found the ship,"
7565,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,but Donovan had sailed for Liverpool. From Liverpool I tracked him to
7566,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"the River Plate, and thence to Panama. You will ask how I lived all"
7567,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"those months? Ask him."""
7568,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7569,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,He turned to Duff Salter.
7570,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7571,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""Mr. Magistrate,"" spoke Duff Salter, a little confused. ""I sent him"
7572,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"drafts at his request. He knew me to be the resident executor, and wrote"
7573,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"to me. I did it because of the pity I had for Agnes, and my faith in her"
7574,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"assurance that he was innocent."""
7575,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7576,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""Good! Yes!"" exclaimed the magistrate. ""I would have done the same"
7577,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"myself."""
7578,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7579,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""I returned with my man,"" concluded Andrew Zane. ""I was now so confident"
7580,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"that I did not fear; but a hard obstinacy, coming on me at times, I"
7581,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"know not how, impelled me to postpone my vindication and make a test of"
7582,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,everybody. I was full of suspicion and bitterness--the reaction from so
7583,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"much undeserved anxiety. I was the ghost of Kensington, and the spy upon"
7584,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"my guardian, but the unknown sentry upon my wife's honor all the while."
7585,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7586,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""Magistrate!""--the young man turned to the alderman, and his face"
7587,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"flushed--""is there no punishment at law for men, and women too, who have"
7588,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"cruelly persecuted my wife with anonymous letters, intended to wound her"
7589,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"brave spirit to the quick?"""
7590,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7591,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""Plenty of it,"" said the magistrate. ""Yes, I will. I will warrant them"
7592,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"all."""
7593,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7594,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""I will not forget it,"" said Andrew Zane darkly."
7595,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7596,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"""My husband, forget everything!"" exclaimed Agnes. ""Except that we are"
7597,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"happy. God has forgiven us our only deceit, which has been the"
7598,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"temptation of many in dear old Kensington."""
7599,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,
7600,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"The old magistrate arose. ""Case dismissed,"" he said: ""Dinner is ready in"
7601,THE SECRET MARRIAGE.,"the next room for Mr. and Mrs. Zane, and Judge Salter. I fine you all a"

7611,TREATY ELM.,
7612,TREATY ELM.,"Andrew Zane was leaning on his elbow, in bed, listening to the tolling"
7613,TREATY ELM.,"bell for the old pastor of Kensington. He had not attended the funeral,"
7614,TREATY ELM.,"fearing to trust his eyes and heart near Calvin Van de Lear, for the"
7615,TREATY ELM.,"unruly element in his blood was not wholly stilled. Good and evil,"
7616,TREATY ELM.,"gratitude and recollection, contended within him, and Agnes just escaped"
7617,TREATY ELM.,from the long shadow of his father's rage--had forebodings of some
7618,TREATY ELM.,violence when the two young men should meet in the little thoroughfare
7619,TREATY ELM.,of Kensington--the one with the accumulated indignities he had suffered
7620,TREATY ELM.,liable to be aroused by the other's shallow superciliousness. Agnes had
7621,TREATY ELM.,"but one friend to carry her fears to--Him ""who never forsaketh."" She had"
7622,TREATY ELM.,"not persisted that her husband should attend the old pastor's funeral,"
7623,TREATY ELM.,"whither Duff Salter escorted her, and going there, relieved from all"
7624,TREATY ELM.,"imputation, her evidently wedded state was seen with general respect."
7625,TREATY ELM.,"People spoke to her as of old, congratulated her even at the grave, and"
7626,TREATY ELM.,"sought to repair their own misapprehensions, suspicions, and severities,"
7627,TREATY ELM.,which Agnes accepted without duplicity.
7628,TREATY ELM.,
7629,TREATY ELM.,Andrew Zane was leaning up in bed hearing the tolling bell when Agnes
7630,TREATY ELM.,reappeared.
7631,TREATY ELM.,
7632,TREATY ELM.,"""Husband,"" she said, ""only Knox Van de Lear was at the grave, of the"

7638,TREATY ELM.,"Kensington."""
7639,TREATY ELM.,
7640,TREATY ELM.,Husband and wife looked at each other a moment in silence.
7641,TREATY ELM.,
7642,TREATY ELM.,"""They say,"" continued Agnes, ""that Calvin Van de Lear has fled with his"
7643,TREATY ELM.,brother's wife. That is the talk of the town. Professing to desire some
7644,TREATY ELM.,"clothing for the funeral, they took a carriage together, and were driven"
7645,TREATY ELM.,"to Tacony yesterday, where the afternoon train, meeting the steamboat"
7646,TREATY ELM.,"from Philadelphia, took them on board for New York."""

7648,TREATY ELM.,Andrew fell back on his pillow.
7649,TREATY ELM.,
7650,TREATY ELM.,"""God has hedged me all around,"" he answered. ""While Calvin Van de Lear"
7651,TREATY ELM.,lived in Kensington I was in revengeful temptation all the time. He has
7652,TREATY ELM.,"escaped, and my soul is oppressed no more. Do you know, Agnes, that the"
7653,TREATY ELM.,"guilty accomplice of Calvin, his brother's wife, wrote all the worst"
7654,TREATY ELM.,"letters which anonymously came through the post?"""
7655,TREATY ELM.,
7656,TREATY ELM.,Agnes replied:
7657,TREATY ELM.,
7658,TREATY ELM.,"""I never suspected it. My heart was too full of you. But Mr. Salter told"
7659,TREATY ELM.,me to-day that he unravelled it some time ago. Calvin Van de Lear showed
7660,TREATY ELM.,"him, in a moment of egotism, the conquest he had made over an unknown"
7661,TREATY ELM.,"lady's affections, and passages of the correspondence. The keen old man"
7662,TREATY ELM.,immediately identified in the handwriting the person who addressed him a
7663,TREATY ELM.,letter against us soon after his arrival in the East. But he did not
7664,TREATY ELM.,"tell me until to-day. How did you know she was the person?"""
7665,TREATY ELM.,
7666,TREATY ELM.,"Andrew Zane blushed a little, and confessed:"
7667,TREATY ELM.,
7668,TREATY ELM.,"""Agnes, she used to write to me. Seeing the anonymous letters you"
7669,TREATY ELM.,"received, I knew the culprit instantly. It was that which precipitated"
7670,TREATY ELM.,the flight. She feared that her anonymous letters would result in her
7671,TREATY ELM.,"arrest and public trial for slander, as they would have done. The"
7672,TREATY ELM.,magistrate promised me that he would issue his warrant for every person
7673,TREATY ELM.,"who had employed the public mails to harass my wife, and when you"
7674,TREATY ELM.,entered this room my darker passions were again working to punish that
7675,TREATY ELM.,"woman and her paramour."""
7676,TREATY ELM.,
7677,TREATY ELM.,"""Dearest, let them be forgotten. Yes, forgiven too. But poor Mr. Knox"

7693,TREATY ELM.,"for a while, accompanies ruined women: the unnatural sharpening of the"
7694,TREATY ELM.,"duplicity, the firmer grasp on man as the animal, the study of the"
7695,TREATY ELM.,"proprieties of life, and apparent impatience with all misbehavior. Her"
7696,TREATY ELM.,"timid voice assisted her cunning as if with a natural gentleness, and"
7697,TREATY ELM.,invited onward the man who expected in her ample charms a bolder spirit.
7698,TREATY ELM.,"She betook herself to the church for penance, perhaps, but remained"
7699,TREATY ELM.,"there for a character. My wife, if I have suffered, it was, perhaps, in"
7700,TREATY ELM.,part because for every sin is some punishment; that woman was _my_
7701,TREATY ELM.,"temptress also!"""
7702,TREATY ELM.,
7703,TREATY ELM.,"His face was pale as he spoke these words, but he did not drop his eyes."
7704,TREATY ELM.,The wife looked at him with a face also paled and startled.
7705,TREATY ELM.,
7706,TREATY ELM.,"""Remember,"" said Andrew Zane, ""that I was a man."""
7707,TREATY ELM.,
7708,TREATY ELM.,She walked to him in a moment and kissed his forehead.
7709,TREATY ELM.,
7710,TREATY ELM.,"""I will have no more deceit,"" said Andrew. ""That is why I give you this"
7711,TREATY ELM.,"pain. It was long, my darling, before we loved."""
7712,TREATY ELM.,
7713,TREATY ELM.,"""That was the source, perhaps, of Lottie's anger with me,"" spoke Agnes."
7714,TREATY ELM.,
7715,TREATY ELM.,"""I think not. There was not a sentiment between us. It is the way,"
7716,TREATY ELM.,"occasionally, that a very bad woman is made, by marriage or wealth,"
7717,TREATY ELM.,"respectable, and she declares war on her own past and its imitators. You"
7718,TREATY ELM.,were pursued because you had exchanged deserts with her. You were pure
7719,TREATY ELM.,and abused; she was approved but tainted. Not your misfortunes but your
7720,TREATY ELM.,"goodness rebuked her, and she lashed you behind her _alias_, as every"
7721,TREATY ELM.,"demon would riot in lashing the angels."""
7722,TREATY ELM.,
7723,TREATY ELM.,"""My husband,"" exclaimed Agnes, ""where did you draw such secrets from"
7724,TREATY ELM.,"woman's nature? God has blessed you with wisdom. I felt, myself, by some"
7725,TREATY ELM.,"intuition of our sex, that it was sin, not virtue, that took such pains"
7726,TREATY ELM.,"to upbraid me."""
7727,TREATY ELM.,
7728,TREATY ELM.,"""I drew them from the old, old plant,"" answered Andrew Zane; ""the Tree"
7729,TREATY ELM.,"of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Yonder, where I skimmed the surface of a"
7730,TREATY ELM.,"bad woman; here, where I am forgiven."""
7731,TREATY ELM.,
7732,TREATY ELM.,"""If you felt remorse,"" said Agnes, ""you were not given up."""
7733,TREATY ELM.,
7734,TREATY ELM.,"""After _we_ were engaged that woman cast her eyes on my widowed father"
7735,TREATY ELM.,and notified me that I must not stand in her way. 'If you embarrass me
7736,TREATY ELM.,"by one word,' she said to me in her pretty, timid way, but with the look"
7737,TREATY ELM.,"of a lion out of her florid fringes, 'I will shatter your future"
7738,TREATY ELM.,hearthstone. You are not fit to marry a Christian woman like Agnes Wilt.
7739,TREATY ELM.,"I am good enough for your father--yes,' she finished, with terrible"
7740,TREATY ELM.,"irony, 'and to be your mother!' Those words went with me around the"
7741,TREATY ELM.,"world. Agnes, was I not punished?"""
7742,TREATY ELM.,
7743,TREATY ELM.,"""To think that the son of so good a man should be bound to such a"
7744,TREATY ELM.,"tyrant."""
7745,TREATY ELM.,
7746,TREATY ELM.,"""Yes, she will make him steal for her, or worse. He will end by being"
7747,TREATY ELM.,"her most degraded creature, leading and misleading to her. Theirs is an"
7748,TREATY ELM.,"unreturning path. God keep us all faithful!"""
7749,TREATY ELM.,
7750,TREATY ELM.,"Duff Salter became again mysterious. He sent for his trunks, and gave"
7751,TREATY ELM.,"his address as the ""Treaty House,"" on Beach Street, nearly opposite the"
7752,TREATY ELM.,"monument, only a square back from the Zane house."
7753,TREATY ELM.,
7754,TREATY ELM.,"""Andrew,"" said Salter, when the young husband sought him there, ""I"
7755,TREATY ELM.,concluded to move because there will be a nurse in that house before
7756,TREATY ELM.,"midsummer. If I was deaf as I once was, it would make no difference. But"
7757,TREATY ELM.,"a very slight cry would certainly pierce my restored sensibilities now."""
7758,TREATY ELM.,
7759,TREATY ELM.,"The Treaty House was a fine, old-fashioned brick, with a long saloon or"
7760,TREATY ELM.,"double parlor containing many curiosities, such as pieces of old ships"
7761,TREATY ELM.,"of war, weapons used in Polynesia and brought home by old sea captains,"
7762,TREATY ELM.,"the jaws of whales and narwhals, figure-heads from perished vessels,"
7763,TREATY ELM.,"harpoons, and points of various naval actions. In those days, before"
7764,TREATY ELM.,"manufactures had extended up all the water streets, and when domestic"
7765,TREATY ELM.,"war had not been known for a whole generation, the little low marble"
7766,TREATY ELM.,monument on the site of William Penn's treaty with the Indians attracted
7767,TREATY ELM.,"hundreds of strangers, who moistened their throats and cooled their"
7768,TREATY ELM.,foreheads in the great bar parlor of the Treaty House. It was still a
7769,TREATY ELM.,"secluded spot, shady and dewy with venerable trees, and the moisture"
7770,TREATY ELM.,"they gave the old brown and black bricks in the contiguous houses, some"
7771,TREATY ELM.,"of them still stylish, and all their windows topped with marble or"
7772,TREATY ELM.,"sandstone, gray with the superincumbent weight of time or neglect. Large"
7773,TREATY ELM.,rear additions and sunless sideyards carried out the idea of a former
7774,TREATY ELM.,"gentry. Some buttonwood trees, now thinning out with annual age,"
7775,TREATY ELM.,conveyed by their speckled trunks the notion of a changing social
7776,TREATY ELM.,"standard, white and brown, native and foreign, while the lines of maples"
7777,TREATY ELM.,"stood on blackened boles like old retired seamen, bronzed in many"
7778,TREATY ELM.,"voyages and planted home forever. But despite the narrow, neglected,"
7779,TREATY ELM.,"shady street, the slope of Shackamaxon went gently shelving to the edges"
7780,TREATY ELM.,"of long sunny wharves, nearly as in the day when Penn selected this"
7781,TREATY ELM.,"greensward to meet his Indian friends, and barter tools and promises for"
7782,TREATY ELM.,"forest levels and long rich valleys, now open to the sky and murmurous"
7783,TREATY ELM.,with wheat and green potato vines.
7784,TREATY ELM.,
7785,TREATY ELM.,"Sitting before the inn door, on drowsy June afternoons, Duff Salter"
7786,TREATY ELM.,heard the adzes ring and hammers smite the thousand bolt-heads on lofty
7787,TREATY ELM.,"vessels, raised on mast-like scaffolds as if they meant to be launched"
7788,TREATY ELM.,"into the air and go cleared for yonder faintly tinted spectral moon,"
7789,TREATY ELM.,"which lingered so long by day, like the symbol of the Indian race,"
7790,TREATY ELM.,departed but lambent in thoughtful memories. Duff had grown
7791,TREATY ELM.,"superstitious; he came out of the inn door sidewise, that he might"
7792,TREATY ELM.,always see that moon over his right shoulder for good luck.
7793,TREATY ELM.,
7794,TREATY ELM.,One morning Andrew Zane appeared at the Treaty House before Duff Salter
7795,TREATY ELM.,"had taken his julep, after the fashion of malarious Arkansas."
7796,TREATY ELM.,
7797,TREATY ELM.,"""Mr. Salter, it is all over. There is a baby at our house."""
7798,TREATY ELM.,
7799,TREATY ELM.,"""Girl?"""
7800,TREATY ELM.,
7801,TREATY ELM.,"""Just that!"""
7802,TREATY ELM.,
7803,TREATY ELM.,"""I thought so,"" exclaimed Duff Salter. ""It was truly mother's labor, and"
7804,TREATY ELM.,"ought to have been like Agnes. We will give her a toast."""
7805,TREATY ELM.,
7806,TREATY ELM.,"""In nothing but water,"" spoke Andrew soberly. ""I hope I have sown my"
7807,TREATY ELM.,"wild oats."""
7808,TREATY ELM.,
7809,TREATY ELM.,"""I will imitate you,"" heartily responded Duff Salter; ""for it occurred"
7810,TREATY ELM.,to me in Arkansas that people shot and butchered each other so often
7811,TREATY ELM.,because they threw into empty stomachs a long tumbler of liquor and
7812,TREATY ELM.,"leaves. You are well started, Andrew. Your father's and his partner's"
7813,TREATY ELM.,"estate will give you an income of $10,000. What will you do?"""
7814,TREATY ELM.,
7815,TREATY ELM.,"""I have no idea whatever. My mind is not ready for business. My serious"
7816,TREATY ELM.,"experience has been followed by a sort of stupor--an inquiry, a detached"
7817,TREATY ELM.,"relation to everything."""
7818,TREATY ELM.,
7819,TREATY ELM.,"""Let it be so awhile,"" answered the strong, gray-eyed man. ""Such rests"
7820,TREATY ELM.,"are often medicine, as sleep is. The mind will find its true channel"
7821,TREATY ELM.,"some day."""
7822,TREATY ELM.,
7823,TREATY ELM.,"""Can I be of service to you, Mr. Salter? Money would be a small return"
7824,TREATY ELM.,"of our obligations to you."""
7825,TREATY ELM.,
7826,TREATY ELM.,"""No, I am independent. Too independent! I wish I had a wife."""
7827,TREATY ELM.,
7828,TREATY ELM.,"""Ah! Agnes told me that besides seeing the baby when you came to the"
7829,TREATY ELM.,"house, little Mary Byerly would be there. She is well enough to be out,"
7830,TREATY ELM.,"and has lost her invalid brother."""
7831,TREATY ELM.,
7832,TREATY ELM.,"""If you see me blush, Andrew,"" said Duff Salter, ""you needn't tell of"
7833,TREATY ELM.,"it. I am in love with little Podge, but it's all over. With no"
7834,TREATY ELM.,"understanding of woman's sensibilities, I shook that fragile child in my"
7835,TREATY ELM.,"rude grasp, and frightened her forever. What will you call your baby?"""
7836,TREATY ELM.,
7837,TREATY ELM.,"""Agnes says it shall be _Euphemia_, meaning 'of good report.' You know"
7838,TREATY ELM.,"it came near being a young lady of bad report."""
7839,TREATY ELM.,
7840,TREATY ELM.,"""As for me, Andrew, I shall make the contract for the steeple and"
7841,TREATY ELM.,"completion of the new church, and then take a foreign journey. Since I"
7842,TREATY ELM.,"stopped sneezing I have no way to disguise my sensibilities, and am more"
7843,TREATY ELM.,"an object of suspicion than ever."""
7844,TREATY ELM.,
7845,TREATY ELM.,Duff Salter peeped at the beautiful mother and hung a chain of gold
7846,TREATY ELM.,"around the baby's neck, and was about slipping out when Podge Byerly"
7847,TREATY ELM.,appeared. She made a low bow and shrank away.
7848,TREATY ELM.,
7849,TREATY ELM.,"""Follow her,"" whispered Andrew Zane. ""If she is cool now she will be"
7850,TREATY ELM.,"cold hereafter, unless you nurse her confidence."""
7851,TREATY ELM.,
7852,TREATY ELM.,"With a sense of great youthfulness and demerit, Duff Salter entered the"
7853,TREATY ELM.,parlors and found Podge sitting in the shadows of that thrice notable
7854,TREATY ELM.,room where death and grief had been so often carried and laid down. The
7855,TREATY ELM.,"little teacher was pale and thin, and her eyes wore a saddened light."
7856,TREATY ELM.,
7857,TREATY ELM.,"""I am very glad to see you again,"" said Duff Salter. ""I wanted your"
7858,TREATY ELM.,"forgiveness."""
7859,TREATY ELM.,
7860,TREATY ELM.,"Striking the centre of sympathy by these few words, the late deaf man"
7861,TREATY ELM.,saw Podge's throat agitated.
7862,TREATY ELM.,
7863,TREATY ELM.,"""If you knew,"" he continued, ""how often I accused myself since your"
7864,TREATY ELM.,"illness, you would try to excuse me."""
7865,TREATY ELM.,
7866,TREATY ELM.,"After a little silence Podge said,"
7867,TREATY ELM.,
7868,TREATY ELM.,"""I don't remember just what happened, Mr. Salter. Was it you who sent me"
7869,TREATY ELM.,many beautiful and dainty things while I was sick? I thought it might
7870,TREATY ELM.,"be."""
7871,TREATY ELM.,
7872,TREATY ELM.,"""You guessed me, then? At least I was not forgotten."""
7873,TREATY ELM.,
7874,TREATY ELM.,"""I never forgot you, sir; but ever since my illness you seem to have"
7875,TREATY ELM.,been a part of the dread river and its dead. I have often tried to
7876,TREATY ELM.,"restore you as I once thought of you, but other things rise up and I"
7877,TREATY ELM.,"cannot see you. My head was gone, I suppose."""
7878,TREATY ELM.,
7879,TREATY ELM.,"""Alas, no! I drove away your heart. If that would come back, the"
7880,TREATY ELM.,"wandering head would follow, little friend. Are you afraid of me?"""
7881,TREATY ELM.,
7882,TREATY ELM.,"""Sometimes. One thing, I think, is your deafness. While you were deaf"
7883,TREATY ELM.,"you seemed so natural that we talked freely before you, prattling out"
7884,TREATY ELM.,our fancies undisguised. We wouldn't have done it if we knew that you
7885,TREATY ELM.,heard as well as we. That makes me afraid too. Oh! why did you deceive
7886,TREATY ELM.,"us so?"""
7887,TREATY ELM.,
7888,TREATY ELM.,"""I only deceived myself. A foolish habit, formed in pique, of affecting"
7889,TREATY ELM.,"not to hear, adhered to me long before we were acquainted. If you will"
7890,TREATY ELM.,let me drive you out into the country to-morrow I will tell you the
7891,TREATY ELM.,"whole of my silly story. The country roads are what you need, and I need"
7892,TREATY ELM.,"your consideration as much."""
7893,TREATY ELM.,
7894,TREATY ELM.,"The next day a buggy stopped at the door, and Podge, sitting at the"
7895,TREATY ELM.,"window with her bonnet on, saw Duff Salter, hale and strong, holding the"
7896,TREATY ELM.,"reins. She was helped into the buggy by Andrew Zane, and in a few"
7897,TREATY ELM.,minutes the two were in the open country pointing toward old Frankford.
7898,TREATY ELM.,"They rode up the long stony street of that old village, whose stone or"
7899,TREATY ELM.,rough-cast houses suggested the Swiss city of Basle whence the early
7900,TREATY ELM.,settlers of Frankford came. Then turning through the factory dale called
7901,TREATY ELM.,"Little Britain, they sped out the lane, taking the general direction of"
7902,TREATY ELM.,"Tacony Creek, and followed that creek up through different little"
7903,TREATY ELM.,"villages and mill-seats until they came to nearly the highest mill-pond,"
7904,TREATY ELM.,in the stony region about the Old York road. A house of gray and reddish
7905,TREATY ELM.,"stones, in irregular forms, mortised in white plaster, sat broadside to"
7906,TREATY ELM.,"the lawn before it, which was covered with venerable trees, and bordered"
7907,TREATY ELM.,"at the roadside by a stone rampart, so that it looked like a hanging"
7908,TREATY ELM.,"lawn. A gate at the lawn-side gave admission to a lane, behind which was"
7909,TREATY ELM.,"the ancient mill-pond suspended in a dewy landscape, with a path in the"
7910,TREATY ELM.,"grass leading up the mill-race, and on the pond a little scow floated in"
7911,TREATY ELM.,"pond-lilies. All around were chestnut trees, their burrs full of fruit."
7912,TREATY ELM.,"Across the lane, only a few feet from the house, the ancient mill gave"
7913,TREATY ELM.,forth a snoring and drumming together as if the spirit of solitude was
7914,TREATY ELM.,having a dance all to itself and only breathing hard. Then the crystal
7915,TREATY ELM.,"water, shooting the old black mill-wheel, fell off it like the beard"
7916,TREATY ELM.,"from Duff Salter's face, and went away in pools and flakes across a"
7917,TREATY ELM.,"meadow, under spontaneous willow trees which liked to stand in moisture"
7918,TREATY ELM.,and cover with their roots the harmless water-snakes. A few cottages
7919,TREATY ELM.,peeped over the adjacent ridges upon the hidden dale.
7920,TREATY ELM.,
7921,TREATY ELM.,"""What a restful place!"" exclaimed Podge Byerly. ""I almost wish I might"
7922,TREATY ELM.,"be spirit of a mill, or better still, that old boat yonder basking in"
7923,TREATY ELM.,"the pond-lilies and holding up its shadow!"""
7924,TREATY ELM.,
7925,TREATY ELM.,"""I am glad you like it,"" said Duff Salter. ""Let us go in and see if the"
7926,TREATY ELM.,"house is hospitable."""
7927,TREATY ELM.,
7928,TREATY ELM.,As Podge Byerly walked up the worn stone walk of the lawn she saw a
7929,TREATY ELM.,familiar image at the door--her mother.
7930,TREATY ELM.,
7931,TREATY ELM.,"""You here, mother?"" said Podge. ""What is the meaning of it?"""
7932,TREATY ELM.,
7933,TREATY ELM.,"""This is my house, my darling. There is our friend who gave it to us."
7934,TREATY ELM.,You will need to teach no more. The mill and a little farm surrounding
7935,TREATY ELM.,"us will make us independent."""
7936,TREATY ELM.,
7937,TREATY ELM.,Podge turned to Duff Salter.
7938,TREATY ELM.,
7939,TREATY ELM.,"""How kind of you!"" she said. ""Yet it frightens me the more. These"
7940,TREATY ELM.,"surprises, tender as they are, excite me. Everything about you is"
7941,TREATY ELM.,mysterious. You are not even deaf as you were. What silly things you may
7942,TREATY ELM.,"have heard us say."""
7943,TREATY ELM.,
7944,TREATY ELM.,"""Dear girl,"" exclaimed Duff Salter, ""nothing which I heard from your"
7945,TREATY ELM.,lips ever affected me except to love you. You cured me of years of
7946,TREATY ELM.,"suspicion, and I consented to hear again. The world grew candid to me;"
7947,TREATY ELM.,"its sounds were melodious, its silence was sincere. It is you who are"
7948,TREATY ELM.,"deaf. You cannot hear my heart."""
7949,TREATY ELM.,
7950,TREATY ELM.,"""I hear no other's, at least,"" said Podge. ""Tell me the story of your"
7951,TREATY ELM.,"strange deceit."""
7952,TREATY ELM.,
7953,TREATY ELM.,They drew chairs upon the lawn. Podge took off her bonnet and looked
7954,TREATY ELM.,very delicate as her color rose and faded alternately in the emotions of
7955,TREATY ELM.,one wooed in earnest and uncertain of her fate.
7956,TREATY ELM.,
7957,TREATY ELM.,"""I have not come by money without hard labor,"" said the hale and"
7958,TREATY ELM.,"handsome man. ""This gray beard is not the creation of many years. It is"
7959,TREATY ELM.,"the fruit of anxiety, toil, and danger. My years are not double yours."""
7960,TREATY ELM.,
7961,TREATY ELM.,"""You have recovered at least one of your faculties since I knew you,"""
7962,TREATY ELM.,said Podge slyly.
7963,TREATY ELM.,
7964,TREATY ELM.,"""You mean hearing. The sense of feeling too, perhaps--which you have"
7965,TREATY ELM.,"lost. But this is my tale: After I went to Mexico, and became the"
7966,TREATY ELM.,"superintendent of a mine, I found my nature growing hard and my manner"
7967,TREATY ELM.,"imperious, not unlike those of my dead friend, William Zane. The hot"
7968,TREATY ELM.,"climate of Mexico and confinement in the mines, hundreds of feet below"
7969,TREATY ELM.,"the surface and in the salivating fumes of the cinnabar retorts,"
7970,TREATY ELM.,"assisted to make me impetuous. I fought more than one duel, and, like"
7971,TREATY ELM.,"all men who do desperate things, grew more desperate by experience"
7972,TREATY ELM.,"until, upon one occasion, I was made deaf by an explosion in the bowels"
7973,TREATY ELM.,of the ground. For one year I could hear but little. In that year I was
7974,TREATY ELM.,"comparatively humble, and one day I heard a workman say, 'If the boss"
7975,TREATY ELM.,gets his hearing back there will be no peace about the mine.' This set
7976,TREATY ELM.,"me to thinking. 'How much of my suspicion and anger,' I said, 'is the"
7977,TREATY ELM.,result of my own speaking. I provoked the distemper of which I am
7978,TREATY ELM.,afflicted. I start the inquiries which make me distrustful. I hear the
7979,TREATY ELM.,"echo of my own idle words, and impeach my fellow-man upon it. Until I"
7980,TREATY ELM.,"find a strong reason for speech, I will remain deaf as I have been.'"
7981,TREATY ELM.,"That strong reason never arrived, my little girl, until all reason"
7982,TREATY ELM.,"ceased to be and love supplanted it."""
7983,TREATY ELM.,
7984,TREATY ELM.,"""There is no reason, then, in your present passion,"" said Podge dryly."
7985,TREATY ELM.,
7986,TREATY ELM.,"""No. I am so absolutely in love that there is no resisting it. It is"
7987,TREATY ELM.,"boyishness wholly."""
7988,TREATY ELM.,
7989,TREATY ELM.,"""I think I should be afraid of a man,"" said Podge, ""who could have so"
7990,TREATY ELM.,much will as to hold his tongue for seven years. Suppose you had a
7991,TREATY ELM.,"second attack, it might never come to an end. What were you thinking"
7992,TREATY ELM.,"about all that time?"""
7993,TREATY ELM.,
7994,TREATY ELM.,"""I thought how deaf, blind, and dumb was any one without love. I found"
7995,TREATY ELM.,the world far better than it had seemed when I was one of its
7996,TREATY ELM.,chatterers. By my voluntary silence I had banished the disturbing
7997,TREATY ELM.,"element in Nature; for our enemy is always within us, not without. In"
7998,TREATY ELM.,"that seven years, for most of which I heard everything and answered"
7999,TREATY ELM.,"none, except by my pencil, I was prosperous, observant, sober, and"
8000,TREATY ELM.,considerate. The deceit of affecting not to hear has brought its
8001,TREATY ELM.,"penalty, however. You are afraid of me."""
8002,TREATY ELM.,
8003,TREATY ELM.,"""Were you ever in love before?"""
8004,TREATY ELM.,
8005,TREATY ELM.,"""I fear I will surprise you again by my answer,"" said Duff Salter. ""I"
8006,TREATY ELM.,once proposed marriage to a young girl on this very lawn. It was in the
8007,TREATY ELM.,springtime of my life. We met at a picnic in a grove not far distant.
8008,TREATY ELM.,"She was a coquette, and forgot me."""
8009,TREATY ELM.,
8010,TREATY ELM.,Podge said she must have time to know her heart. Every day they made a
8011,TREATY ELM.,"new excursion, now into the country of the Neshaminy, and beyond it to"
8012,TREATY ELM.,the vales of the Tohicken and Perkiomen. They descended the lanes along
8013,TREATY ELM.,"the Pennypack and Poqessing, and followed the Wissahickon to its"
8014,TREATY ELM.,"sources. Podge rapidly grew in form and spirits, and Agnes and Andrew"
8015,TREATY ELM.,Zane came out to spend a Saturday with them.
8016,TREATY ELM.,
8017,TREATY ELM.,"Mean time Andrew Zane was in a mystic condition--uncertain of purpose,"
8018,TREATY ELM.,"serious, and studious, and he called one night at the Treaty tavern to"
8019,TREATY ELM.,"see Duff Salter. Duff had gone, however, up the Tacony, and in a"
8020,TREATY ELM.,listless way Andrew sauntered over to the little monument erected on the
8021,TREATY ELM.,alleged site of the Indian treaty. He read the inscription aloud:
8022,TREATY ELM.,
8023,TREATY ELM.,"""Treaty Ground of William Penn and the Indian Nations, 1682. Unbroken"
8024,TREATY ELM.,"Faith! Pennsylvania, founded by deeds of Peace!"""
8025,TREATY ELM.,
8026,TREATY ELM.,"As Andrew ceased he looked up and beheld a man of rather portly figure,"
8027,TREATY ELM.,"with the plain clothes of a Quaker, a broad-brimmed hat, knee-breeches,"
8028,TREATY ELM.,and buckled shoes. Something in his countenance was familiar. Andrew
8029,TREATY ELM.,"looked again, and wondered where he had seen that face. It then occurred"
8030,TREATY ELM.,to him that it was the exact likeness of William Penn. The man locked at
8031,TREATY ELM.,"Andrew and said,"
8032,TREATY ELM.,
8033,TREATY ELM.,"""Thee is called to preach!"""
8034,TREATY ELM.,
8035,TREATY ELM.,"""Sir?"" exclaimed Andrew."
8036,TREATY ELM.,
8037,TREATY ELM.,"In the same tone of voice the man exclaimed,"
8038,TREATY ELM.,
8039,TREATY ELM.,"""Thee is called to preach!"""
8040,TREATY ELM.,
8041,TREATY ELM.,"Andrew looked with some slight superstition at the peculiar man, with"
8042,TREATY ELM.,"such a tone of authority, and said again, but respectfully:"
8043,TREATY ELM.,
8044,TREATY ELM.,"""Do I understand you as speaking to me, sir?"""
8045,TREATY ELM.,
8046,TREATY ELM.,"""Thee is called to preach!"" said the object, in precisely the same tone"
8047,TREATY ELM.,"of voice, and vanished."
8048,TREATY ELM.,
8049,TREATY ELM.,"Andrew Zane walked across to the hotel and saw Duff Salter, freshly"
8050,TREATY ELM.,"arrived, looking at him intently."
8051,TREATY ELM.,
8052,TREATY ELM.,"""Did you see a person in Quaker dress standing by the monument an"
8053,TREATY ELM.,"instant past?"""
8054,TREATY ELM.,
8055,TREATY ELM.,"""I saw nobody but yourself,"" said Duff heartily. ""I have been looking at"
8056,TREATY ELM.,"you some moments."""
8057,TREATY ELM.,
8058,TREATY ELM.,"""As truly as I live, a man in Quaker dress spoke to me at the monument's"
8059,TREATY ELM.,"side."""
8060,TREATY ELM.,
8061,TREATY ELM.,"""What did he say?"""
8062,TREATY ELM.,
8063,TREATY ELM.,"""He said three times, deliberately, 'Thee is called to preach!'"""
8064,TREATY ELM.,
8065,TREATY ELM.,"""That's queer,"" said Duff, looking curiously at Andrew. ""My friend, that"
8066,TREATY ELM.,man spoke from within you. Do you know that it is the earnest desire of
8067,TREATY ELM.,"your wife, and a subject of her prayers, that you may become a"
8068,TREATY ELM.,"minister?"""
8069,TREATY ELM.,
8070,TREATY ELM.,"""I didn't know it,"" said Andrew. ""But there is something startling in"
8071,TREATY ELM.,"this apparition. I shall never be able to forget it."""
8072,TREATY ELM.,
8073,TREATY ELM.,"To the joy of Agnes, now a happy wife and mother, her husband went"
8074,TREATY ELM.,"seriously into the church, and the moment his intention was announced of"
8075,TREATY ELM.,"entering the ministry, there arose a spontaneous and united wish that he"
8076,TREATY ELM.,would take the pulpit in his native suburb.
8077,TREATY ELM.,
8078,TREATY ELM.,"""Agnes,"" said the young man, ""the dangers I have passed, the tragedy of"
8079,TREATY ELM.,"my family, your piety and my feelings, all concur in this step. I feel a"
8080,TREATY ELM.,"new life within me, now that I have settled upon this design."""
8081,TREATY ELM.,
8082,TREATY ELM.,"""I would rather see you a good minister than President,"" exclaimed"
8083,TREATY ELM.,"Agnes. ""The desires of my heart are fully answered now. When you saw the"
8084,TREATY ELM.,image standing by the Treaty tree at that instant I was upon my knees
8085,TREATY ELM.,"asking God to turn your heart toward the ministry."""
8086,TREATY ELM.,
8087,TREATY ELM.,"""Here in Kensington,"" spoke Andrew, ""we will live down all imputation"
8088,TREATY ELM.,"and renew our family name. Here, where we made our one mistake, we will"
8089,TREATY ELM.,labor for others who err and suffer. Such an escape as ours can be
8090,TREATY ELM.,"celebrated by nothing less than religion."""
8091,TREATY ELM.,
8092,TREATY ELM.,Duff Salter went to Tacony for the last time on the Sunday Andrew Zane
8093,TREATY ELM.,"entered the church. He did not speak a word, but at the appearance of"
8094,TREATY ELM.,Podge Byerly drew out the ancient ivory tablets and wrote:
8095,TREATY ELM.,
8096,TREATY ELM.,"""I'll never speak again until you accept or refuse me."""
8097,TREATY ELM.,
8098,TREATY ELM.,"She answered, ""What are you going to do if I say _no_?"""
8099,TREATY ELM.,
8100,TREATY ELM.,"""I have bought two tickets for Europe,"" wrote Duff Salter. ""One is for"
8101,TREATY ELM.,"you, if you will accept it. If not I shall go alone and be deaf for the"
8102,TREATY ELM.,"remainder of my days."""
8103,TREATY ELM.,
8104,TREATY ELM.,Podge answered by reaching out her lips and kissing Duff Salter plumply.
8105,TREATY ELM.,
8106,TREATY ELM.,"""There,"" she said, ""I've done it!"""
8107,TREATY ELM.,
8108,TREATY ELM.,"Duff Salter threw the tablets away, and standing up in a glow of"
8109,TREATY ELM.,"excitement, gave with great unction his last articulate sneeze:"
8110,TREATY ELM.,
8111,TREATY ELM.,"""Jericho! Jericho!"""
