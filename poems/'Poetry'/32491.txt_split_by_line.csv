71,PREFACE,"This book is, in part, a reprint of _The Wild Swans at Coole_, printed a"
72,PREFACE,"year ago on my sister's hand-press at Dundrum, Co. Dublin. I have not,"
73,PREFACE,"however, reprinted a play which may be a part of a book of new plays"
74,PREFACE,"suggested by the dance plays of Japan, and I have added a number of new"
75,PREFACE,"poems. Michael Robartes and John Aherne, whose names occur in one or"
76,PREFACE,"other of these, are characters in some stories I wrote years ago, who"
77,PREFACE,have once again become a part of the phantasmagoria through which I can
78,PREFACE,alone express my convictions about the world. I have the fancy that I
79,PREFACE,read the name John Aherne among those of men prosecuted for making a
80,PREFACE,"disturbance at the first production of ""The Play Boy,"" which may account"
81,PREFACE,for his animosity to myself.

1163,BROKEN DREAMS,There is grey in your hair.
1164,BROKEN DREAMS,Young men no longer suddenly catch their breath
1165,BROKEN DREAMS,When you are passing;
1166,BROKEN DREAMS,But maybe some old gaffer mutters a blessing
1167,BROKEN DREAMS,Because it was your prayer
1168,BROKEN DREAMS,Recovered him upon the bed of death.
1169,BROKEN DREAMS,"For your sole sake--that all heart's ache have known,"
1170,BROKEN DREAMS,"And given to others all heart's ache,"
1171,BROKEN DREAMS,From meagre girlhood's putting on
1172,BROKEN DREAMS,Burdensome beauty--for your sole sake
1173,BROKEN DREAMS,"Heaven has put away the stroke of her doom,"
1174,BROKEN DREAMS,So great her portion in that peace you make
1175,BROKEN DREAMS,By merely walking in a room.
1176,BROKEN DREAMS,
1177,BROKEN DREAMS,Your beauty can but leave among us
1178,BROKEN DREAMS,"Vague memories, nothing but memories."
1179,BROKEN DREAMS,A young man when the old men are done talking
1180,BROKEN DREAMS,"Will say to an old man, 'Tell me of that lady"
1181,BROKEN DREAMS,The poet stubborn with his passion sang us
1182,BROKEN DREAMS,When age might well have chilled his blood.'
1183,BROKEN DREAMS,
1184,BROKEN DREAMS,"Vague memories, nothing but memories,"
1185,BROKEN DREAMS,"But in the grave all, all, shall be renewed."
1186,BROKEN DREAMS,The certainty that I shall see that lady
1187,BROKEN DREAMS,Leaning or standing or walking
1188,BROKEN DREAMS,"In the first loveliness of womanhood,"
1189,BROKEN DREAMS,"And with the fervour of my youthful eyes,"
1190,BROKEN DREAMS,Has set me muttering like a fool.
1191,BROKEN DREAMS,
1192,BROKEN DREAMS,You are more beautiful than any one
1193,BROKEN DREAMS,And yet your body had a flaw:
1194,BROKEN DREAMS,"Your small hands were not beautiful,"
1195,BROKEN DREAMS,And I am afraid that you will run
1196,BROKEN DREAMS,And paddle to the wrist
1197,BROKEN DREAMS,"In that mysterious, always brimming lake"
1198,BROKEN DREAMS,Where those that have obeyed the holy law
1199,BROKEN DREAMS,Paddle and are perfect; leave unchanged
1200,BROKEN DREAMS,The hands that I have kissed
1201,BROKEN DREAMS,For old sakes' sake.
1202,BROKEN DREAMS,
1203,BROKEN DREAMS,The last stroke of midnight dies.
1204,BROKEN DREAMS,All day in the one chair
1205,BROKEN DREAMS,From dream to dream and rhyme to rhyme I have ranged

1617,ROBARTES,ROBARTES
1618,ROBARTES,
1619,ROBARTES,A rat or water-hen
1620,ROBARTES,"Splashed, or an otter slid into the stream."
1621,ROBARTES,"We are on the bridge; that shadow is the tower,"
1622,ROBARTES,And the light proves that he is reading still.
1623,ROBARTES,"He has found, after the manner of his kind,"
1624,ROBARTES,Mere images; chosen this place to live in
1625,ROBARTES,"Because, it may be, of the candle light"
1626,ROBARTES,From the far tower where Milton's platonist
1627,ROBARTES,"Sat late, or Shelley's visionary prince:"
1628,ROBARTES,"The lonely light that Samuel Palmer engraved,"
1629,ROBARTES,An image of mysterious wisdom won by toil;
1630,ROBARTES,And now he seeks in book or manuscript

1636,AHERNE,"Who know it all ring at his door, and speak"
1637,AHERNE,Just truth enough to show that his whole life
1638,AHERNE,Will scarcely find for him a broken crust
1639,AHERNE,Of all those truths that are your daily bread;
1640,AHERNE,And when you have spoken take the roads again?

1656,ROBARTES,"The full and the moon's dark and all the crescents,"
1657,ROBARTES,"Twenty-and-eight, and yet but six-and-twenty"
1658,ROBARTES,The cradles that a man must needs be rocked in:
1659,ROBARTES,For there's no human life at the full or the dark.
1660,ROBARTES,"From the first crescent to the half, the dream"
1661,ROBARTES,But summons to adventure and the man
1662,ROBARTES,Is always happy like a bird or a beast;
1663,ROBARTES,But while the moon is rounding towards the full
1664,ROBARTES,He follows whatever whim's most difficult
1665,ROBARTES,"Among whims not impossible, and though scarred"
1666,ROBARTES,"As with the cat-o'-nine-tails of the mind,"
1667,ROBARTES,His body moulded from within his body

1669,ROBARTES,"Athenae takes Achilles by the hair,"
1670,ROBARTES,"Hector is in the dust, Nietzsche is born,"
1671,ROBARTES,Because the heroes' crescent is the twelfth.
1672,ROBARTES,"And yet, twice born, twice buried, grow he must,"
1673,ROBARTES,"Before the full moon, helpless as a worm."
1674,ROBARTES,The thirteenth moon but sets the soul at war
1675,ROBARTES,"In its own being, and when that war's begun"
1676,ROBARTES,There is no muscle in the arm; and after
1677,ROBARTES,Under the frenzy of the fourteenth moon
1678,ROBARTES,"The soul begins to tremble into stillness,"
1679,ROBARTES,To die into the labyrinth of itself!

1686,ROBARTES,ROBARTES
1687,ROBARTES,
1688,ROBARTES,All thought becomes an image and the soul
1689,ROBARTES,Becomes a body: that body and that soul
1690,ROBARTES,"Too perfect at the full to lie in a cradle,"
1691,ROBARTES,Too lonely for the traffic of the world:
1692,ROBARTES,Body and soul cast out and cast away
1693,ROBARTES,Beyond the visible world.

1695,AHERNE,AHERNE

1706,AHERNE,The song will have it
1707,AHERNE,That those that we have loved got their long fingers
1708,AHERNE,"From death, and wounds, or on Sinai's top,"
1709,AHERNE,Or from some bloody whip in their own hands.
1710,AHERNE,They ran from cradle to cradle till at last
1711,AHERNE,Their beauty dropped out of the loneliness
1712,AHERNE,Of body and soul.

1720,AHERNE,It must be that the terror in their eyes

1723,AHERNE,
1724,ROBARTES,ROBARTES
1725,ROBARTES,
1726,ROBARTES,When the moon's full those creatures of the full
1727,ROBARTES,Are met on the waste hills by country men
1728,ROBARTES,Who shudder and hurry by: body and soul
1729,ROBARTES,"Estranged amid the strangeness of themselves,"
1730,ROBARTES,"Caught up in contemplation, the mind's eye"
1731,ROBARTES,"Fixed upon images that once were thought,"
1732,ROBARTES,"For separate, perfect, and immovable"
1733,ROBARTES,Images can break the solitude
1734,ROBARTES,"Of lovely, satisfied, indifferent eyes."
1735,ROBARTES,
1736,ROBARTES,"_And thereupon with aged, high-pitched voice"
1737,ROBARTES,"Aherne laughed, thinking of the man within,"
1738,ROBARTES,His sleepless candle and laborious pen._
1739,ROBARTES,
1740,ROBARTES,ROBARTES
1741,ROBARTES,
1742,ROBARTES,And after that the crumbling of the moon.
1743,ROBARTES,The soul remembering its loneliness
1744,ROBARTES,"Shudders in many cradles; all is changed,"
1745,ROBARTES,"It would be the World's servant, and as it serves,"
1746,ROBARTES,Choosing whatever task's most difficult
1747,ROBARTES,"Among tasks not impossible, it takes"
1748,ROBARTES,Upon the body and upon the soul
1749,ROBARTES,The coarseness of the drudge.
1750,ROBARTES,
1751,AHERNE,AHERNE
1752,AHERNE,
1753,AHERNE,Before the full

1756,ROBARTES,ROBARTES
1757,ROBARTES,
1758,ROBARTES,"Because you are forgotten, half out of life,"
1759,ROBARTES,And never wrote a book your thought is clear.
1760,ROBARTES,"Reformer, merchant, statesman, learned man,"
1761,ROBARTES,"Dutiful husband, honest wife by turn,"
1762,ROBARTES,"Cradle upon cradle, and all in flight and all"
1763,ROBARTES,Deformed because there is no deformity
1764,ROBARTES,But saves us from a dream.
1765,ROBARTES,
1766,AHERNE,AHERNE
1767,AHERNE,
1768,AHERNE,And what of those
1769,AHERNE,That the last servile crescent has set free?
1770,AHERNE,
1771,ROBARTES,ROBARTES
1772,ROBARTES,
1773,ROBARTES,"Because all dark, like those that are all light,"
1774,ROBARTES,"They are cast beyond the verge, and in a cloud,"
1775,ROBARTES,Crying to one another like the bats;
1776,ROBARTES,And having no desire they cannot tell
1777,ROBARTES,"What's good or bad, or what it is to triumph"
1778,ROBARTES,At the perfection of one's own obedience;
1779,ROBARTES,And yet they speak what's blown into the mind;
1780,ROBARTES,"Deformed beyond deformity, unformed,"
1781,ROBARTES,"Insipid as the dough before it is baked,"
1782,ROBARTES,They change their bodies at a word.

1788,ROBARTES,ROBARTES
1789,ROBARTES,
1790,ROBARTES,When all the dough has been so kneaded up
1791,ROBARTES,That it can take what form cook Nature fancy
1792,ROBARTES,The first thin crescent is wheeled round once more.
1793,ROBARTES,

1800,ROBARTES,Hunchback and saint and fool are the last crescents.
1801,ROBARTES,The burning bow that once could shoot an arrow
1802,ROBARTES,"Out of the up and down, the wagon wheel"
1803,ROBARTES,"Of beauty's cruelty and wisdom's chatter,"
1804,ROBARTES,Out of that raving tide is drawn betwixt
1805,ROBARTES,Deformity of body and of mind.
1806,ROBARTES,
1807,AHERNE,AHERNE
1808,AHERNE,
1809,AHERNE,"Were not our beds far off I'd ring the bell,"
1810,AHERNE,Stand under the rough roof-timbers of the hall
1811,AHERNE,"Beside the castle door, where all is stark"
1812,AHERNE,"Austerity, a place set out for wisdom"
1813,AHERNE,That he will never find; I'd play a part;
1814,AHERNE,He would never know me after all these years
1815,AHERNE,But take me for some drunken country man;
1816,AHERNE,I'd stand and mutter there until he caught
1817,AHERNE,"'Hunchback and saint and fool,' and that they came"
1818,AHERNE,"Under the three last crescents of the moon,"
1819,AHERNE,And then I'd stagger out. He'd crack his wits
1820,AHERNE,"Day after day, yet never find the meaning."
1821,AHERNE,
1822,AHERNE,_And then he laughed to think that what seemed hard
1823,AHERNE,Should be so simple--a bat rose from the hazels
1824,AHERNE,"And circled round him with its squeaky cry,"
1825,AHERNE,The light in the tower window was put out._

1969,I,
1970,I,On the grey rock of Cashel the mind's eye
1971,I,Has called up the cold spirits that are born
1972,I,When the old moon is vanished from the sky
1973,I,And the new still hides her horn.
1974,I,
1975,I,Under blank eyes and fingers never still

2006,II,Now at its fifteenth night.
2007,II,
2008,II,One lashed her tail; her eyes lit by the moon
2009,II,"Gazed upon all things known, all things unknown,"

2011,II,With motionless head erect.
2012,II,
2013,II,"That other's moonlit eyeballs never moved,"

2018,II,"Oh, little did they care who danced between,"
2019,II,And little she by whom her dance was seen
2020,II,"So that she danced. No thought,"

2023,II,For what but eye and ear silence the mind
2024,II,With the minute particulars of mankind?
2025,II,Mind moved yet seemed to stop
2026,II,As 'twere a spinning-top.
