34,J'ÉCRIS POUR QUE LE JOUR OÙ JE NE SERAI PLUS,"On sache comme l'air et le plaisir m'ont plu,"
35,J'ÉCRIS POUR QUE LE JOUR OÙ JE NE SERAI PLUS,Et que mon livre porte à la foule future
36,J'ÉCRIS POUR QUE LE JOUR OÙ JE NE SERAI PLUS,Comme j'aimais la vie et l'heureuse nature.
37,J'ÉCRIS POUR QUE LE JOUR OÙ JE NE SERAI PLUS,
38,J'ÉCRIS POUR QUE LE JOUR OÙ JE NE SERAI PLUS,Attentive aux travaux des champs et des maisons

47,J'ÉCRIS POUR QUE LE JOUR OÙ JE NE SERAI PLUS,

50,J'ÉCRIS POUR QUE LE JOUR OÙ JE NE SERAI PLUS,"Ayant tout oublié des épouses réelles,"
51,J'ÉCRIS POUR QUE LE JOUR OÙ JE NE SERAI PLUS,M'accueille dans son âme et me préfère à elles.

104,CONTENTS,The Inn of Dreams
105,CONTENTS,
106,CONTENTS,Sweet Laughter! Sweet Delight!
107,CONTENTS,My heart is like a lighted Inn that waits
108,CONTENTS,Your swift approach . . . and at the open gates
109,CONTENTS,White Beauty stands and listens like a flower.
110,CONTENTS,"She has been dreaming of you in the night,"
111,CONTENTS,O fairy Princes; and her eyes are bright.
112,CONTENTS,"Spur your fleet horses, this is Beauty's hour!"
113,CONTENTS,Even as when a golden flame up-curled
114,CONTENTS,"Quivers and flickers out in a dark place,"
115,CONTENTS,So is it with the flame of Beauty's face--
116,CONTENTS,That torch! that rose! that wonder of the world!
117,CONTENTS,And Love shall weep to see--when he rides by
118,CONTENTS,Years hence (the time shall seem as a bird's flight)--
119,CONTENTS,A lonely Inn beneath a winter sky.
120,CONTENTS,"Come now, sweet friends! before the summer die."
121,CONTENTS,Sweet Laughter! Sweet Delight!
122,CONTENTS,
123,CONTENTS,
124,CONTENTS,
125,CONTENTS,
126,CONTENTS,
127,CONTENTS,The Kingdom of Heaven
128,CONTENTS,
129,CONTENTS,"O World that holds me by the wings,"
130,CONTENTS,How shall my soul escape your snares?
131,CONTENTS,"So dear are your delightful things,"
132,CONTENTS,So difficult your toils and cares:
133,CONTENTS,"That, every way my soul is held"
134,CONTENTS,"By bonds of love, and bonds of hate;"
135,CONTENTS,"With all its heavenly ardours quelled,"
136,CONTENTS,And all its angels desolate . . .
137,CONTENTS,
138,CONTENTS,"Yet in the heart of every child,"
139,CONTENTS,God and the world are reconciled! . . .

145,CONTENTS,A Dream
146,CONTENTS,
147,CONTENTS,"I dreamed we walked together, you and I,"
148,CONTENTS,"Along a white and lonely road, that went"
149,CONTENTS,I know not where . . . and we were well content.
150,CONTENTS,"Our laughter was untroubled as the sky,"
151,CONTENTS,"And all our talk was delicate and shy,"
152,CONTENTS,Though in that cage of words wild thoughts were pent
153,CONTENTS,Like prisoned birds that some sweet accident
154,CONTENTS,"Might yet release to sing again, and fly."
155,CONTENTS,We passed between long lines of poplar trees . . .
156,CONTENTS,"Where, summer comrades gay and debonair,"
157,CONTENTS,"The south wind and the sunlight danced . . . you smiled,"
158,CONTENTS,"With great glad eyes, as bright as summer seas,"
159,CONTENTS,To feel their twinkling fingers in your hair . .
160,CONTENTS,"And then you kissed me, quickly, like a child!"
161,CONTENTS,
162,CONTENTS,
163,CONTENTS,
164,CONTENTS,
165,CONTENTS,
166,CONTENTS,The Autumn Day
167,CONTENTS,
168,CONTENTS,How delicately steps the autumn day
169,CONTENTS,In azure cloak and gown of ashen grey
170,CONTENTS,Over the level country that I love!
171,CONTENTS,
172,CONTENTS,With glittering veils of light about her head
173,CONTENTS,And skirts of wide horizons round her spread
174,CONTENTS,White as the white wing-feathers of a dove.
175,CONTENTS,
176,CONTENTS,"Her feet, a flash of silver on the sea,"
177,CONTENTS,Chase silver sails that fly untiringly
178,CONTENTS,Towards the enchanted Islands of the West.
179,CONTENTS,
180,CONTENTS,"Beautiful Islands, gardens of delight!"
181,CONTENTS,That flower at dawn with roses red and white . . .
182,CONTENTS,And flame at sunset gold and amethyst . . .
183,CONTENTS,
184,CONTENTS,How delicately steps the autumn day
185,CONTENTS,In azure cloak and gown of ashen grey
186,CONTENTS,Over the level country that I love . . .
187,CONTENTS,
188,CONTENTS,And how my heart that all sweet things beguile
189,CONTENTS,Goes laughing with her for a little while . . .
190,CONTENTS,And then turns homeward like a weary dove.
191,CONTENTS,
192,CONTENTS,
193,CONTENTS,
194,CONTENTS,
195,CONTENTS,
196,CONTENTS,Angels
197,CONTENTS,
198,CONTENTS,"When life is difficult, I dream"
199,CONTENTS,Of how the angels dance in heaven!
200,CONTENTS,Of how the angels dance and sing
201,CONTENTS,"In gardens of eternal spring,"
202,CONTENTS,Because their sins have been forgiven . . .
203,CONTENTS,And never more for them shall be
204,CONTENTS,The terrors of mortality!
205,CONTENTS,"When life is difficult, I dream"
206,CONTENTS,Of how the angels dance in heaven . . .
207,CONTENTS,
208,CONTENTS,
209,CONTENTS,
210,CONTENTS,
211,CONTENTS,
212,CONTENTS,The Changeling
213,CONTENTS,
214,CONTENTS,"My father was a golden king,"
215,CONTENTS,My mother was a shining queen;
216,CONTENTS,I heard the magic blue-bird sing . . .
217,CONTENTS,They wrapped me in a mantle green.
218,CONTENTS,
219,CONTENTS,"They led their winged white horses out,"
220,CONTENTS,We rode and rode till dawn was grey;
221,CONTENTS,"We rode with many a song and shout,"
222,CONTENTS,"""Over the hills and far away."""
223,CONTENTS,
224,CONTENTS,"They stole the crying human child,"
225,CONTENTS,And left me laughing by the fire;
226,CONTENTS,"And that is why my heart is wild,"
227,CONTENTS,And all my life a long desire . . .
228,CONTENTS,
229,CONTENTS,The old enchantments hold me still . . .
230,CONTENTS,And sometimes in a waking trance
231,CONTENTS,"I seek again the Fairy Hill,"
232,CONTENTS,"The midnight feast, the glittering dance!"
233,CONTENTS,
234,CONTENTS,"The wizard harpers play for me,"
235,CONTENTS,"I wear a crown upon my head,"
236,CONTENTS,"A princess in eternity,"
237,CONTENTS,I dance and revel with the dead . . .
238,CONTENTS,
239,CONTENTS,"""Vain lies!"" I hear the people cry,"
240,CONTENTS,I listen to their weary truth;
241,CONTENTS,"Then turn again to fantasy,"
242,CONTENTS,And the untroubled Land of Youth.
243,CONTENTS,
244,CONTENTS,"I hear the laughter of the kings,"
245,CONTENTS,I see their jewelled flagons gleam . . .
246,CONTENTS,O wine of Life! . . . immortal things
247,CONTENTS,Move in the splendour of my dream . . .
248,CONTENTS,
249,CONTENTS,My spirit is a homing dove . . .
250,CONTENTS,"I drain a crystal cup, and fall"
251,CONTENTS,Softly into the arms of Love . . .
252,CONTENTS,And then the darkness covers all.
253,CONTENTS,
254,CONTENTS,
255,CONTENTS,
256,CONTENTS,
257,CONTENTS,
258,CONTENTS,A Song Against Care
259,CONTENTS,
260,CONTENTS,O Care!
261,CONTENTS,"Thou art a cloak too heavy to be borne,"
262,CONTENTS,"Glittering with tears, and gay with painted lies"
263,CONTENTS,"(For seldom--seldom art thou stained and torn,"
264,CONTENTS,"Showing a tattered lining, and the bare"
265,CONTENTS,Bruised body of thy wearer); thou art fair
266,CONTENTS,"To look at, O thou garment of our pride!"
267,CONTENTS,"A net of colours, thou dost catch the wise;"
268,CONTENTS,He lays aside his wisdom for thy sake . . .
269,CONTENTS,And Beauty hides her loveliness in thee . . .
270,CONTENTS,And after . . . when men know the agony
271,CONTENTS,"Of thy great weight of splendour, and would shake"
272,CONTENTS,"Thee swiftly from their shoulders, cast aside"
273,CONTENTS,The burden of thy jewelled bands that break
274,CONTENTS,Their very hearts . . . often it is too late.
275,CONTENTS,They fear the world will mock them and deride
276,CONTENTS,When they are stripped of all their golden state.
277,CONTENTS,But some are brave . . . but some among us dare
278,CONTENTS,Cry out against thy torment and be free!
279,CONTENTS,"And I would rather a gay beggar be,"
280,CONTENTS,"And go in rags for all eternity,"
281,CONTENTS,"Than that thy clanking pomp should cover me,"
282,CONTENTS,O Care! . . .
283,CONTENTS,
284,CONTENTS,
285,CONTENTS,
286,CONTENTS,
287,CONTENTS,
288,CONTENTS,"""Quelque part une Enfance très douce doit mourir"""
289,CONTENTS,Albert Samian
290,CONTENTS,
291,CONTENTS,Alas! I do not know on what sad day
292,CONTENTS,My childhood went away . . .
293,CONTENTS,It may have left me softly in the night
294,CONTENTS,When I was sleeping--dreaming--who can tell?
295,CONTENTS,"Perhaps it whispered ""wings were made for flight!"""
296,CONTENTS,"I only know it never said ""farewell"" . . ."
297,CONTENTS,
298,CONTENTS,And so I cannot tell when youth will go
299,CONTENTS,Although I love it so . . .
300,CONTENTS,But like a little amorous girl that clings
301,CONTENTS,"To some fair boy, my spirit all afraid,"
302,CONTENTS,"While yet she holds youth back by the bright wings,"
303,CONTENTS,Knows he must leave her for some other maid!
304,CONTENTS,
305,CONTENTS,
306,CONTENTS,
307,CONTENTS,
308,CONTENTS,
309,CONTENTS,Candle-Light
310,CONTENTS,
311,CONTENTS,"Frail golden flowers that perish at a breath,"
312,CONTENTS,"Flickering points of honey-coloured flame,"
313,CONTENTS,"From sunset gardens of the moon you came,"
314,CONTENTS,Pale flowers of passion . . . delicate flowers of death . . .
315,CONTENTS,
316,CONTENTS,Blossoms of opal fire that raised on high
317,CONTENTS,Upon a hundred silver stems are seen
318,CONTENTS,"Above the brilliant dance, or set between"
319,CONTENTS,The brimming wine-cups . . . flowers of revelry!
320,CONTENTS,
321,CONTENTS,Roses with amber petals that arise
322,CONTENTS,Out of the purple darkness of the night
323,CONTENTS,"To deck the darkened house of Love, to light"
324,CONTENTS,"The laughing lips, the beautiful glad eyes."
325,CONTENTS,
326,CONTENTS,Lilies with violet-coloured hearts that break
327,CONTENTS,"In shining clusters round the silent dead,"
328,CONTENTS,"A diadem of stars at feet and head,"
329,CONTENTS,The glory dazzles . . . but they do not wake . . .
330,CONTENTS,
331,CONTENTS,O golden flowers the moon goes gathering
332,CONTENTS,"In magic gardens of her fairy-land,"
333,CONTENTS,While splendid angels of the sunset stand
334,CONTENTS,Watching in flaming circles wing to wing . . .
335,CONTENTS,
336,CONTENTS,"Frail golden flowers that perish at a breath,"
337,CONTENTS,"That wither in the hands of light, and die"
338,CONTENTS,When bright dawn wakens in a silver sky.
339,CONTENTS,Pale flowers of passion . . . delicate flowers of death.
340,CONTENTS,
341,CONTENTS,
342,CONTENTS,
343,CONTENTS,
344,CONTENTS,
345,CONTENTS,In the South
346,CONTENTS,
347,CONTENTS,I was pale and sad in the South like the olive-trees
348,CONTENTS,"That droop their silver heads by the dusty roads,"
349,CONTENTS,And are grave and cold and grey in spite of the sun . . .
350,CONTENTS,In the veils of rose and blue that the bright dawn spun
351,CONTENTS,Day wrapped me round in vain!
352,CONTENTS,"I longed for the lovers and friends I had left behind,"
353,CONTENTS,I longed for the North again.
354,CONTENTS,
355,CONTENTS,"I was deaf to song, and even to beauty blind,"
356,CONTENTS,"Blind to the magic woof that summer weaves,"
357,CONTENTS,While roses beat their pearl and ruby leaves
358,CONTENTS,Against my window pane . . .
359,CONTENTS,"And orange flowers so passionately white,"
360,CONTENTS,"So richly perfumed, pined for my delight:"
361,CONTENTS,"Only my faint heart sighed,"
362,CONTENTS,"In pity when the glory waned and died,"
363,CONTENTS,For all that lovely life unsatisfied!
364,CONTENTS,
365,CONTENTS,I was pale and sad in the South like the olive-trees
366,CONTENTS,That droop their silver heads by the dusty roads . . .
367,CONTENTS,
368,CONTENTS,
369,CONTENTS,
370,CONTENTS,
371,CONTENTS,
372,CONTENTS,Spring in the South
373,CONTENTS,
374,CONTENTS,Beautiful as some rich embroidery
375,CONTENTS,"The valley lies in verdant amplitude,"
376,CONTENTS,Great mountains--like old merchants--o'er it brood--
377,CONTENTS,And as a lovely woman languidly
378,CONTENTS,"Trailing her long blue robes, so comes the sea"
379,CONTENTS,To touch it softly in a wistful mood . . .
380,CONTENTS,"The sky forgets her starry multitude,"
381,CONTENTS,Seeing how fair mere earthly flowers can be!
382,CONTENTS,
383,CONTENTS,"Glad country where the wayward feet of Spring,"
384,CONTENTS,"Moving in mystic dances, bring desire,"
385,CONTENTS,New miracles of beauty every day . . .
386,CONTENTS,Where Love and sweet Delight fly wing to wing
387,CONTENTS,"Forgetful as in dreams, that bright as fire"
388,CONTENTS,So burn the hours of joy as swift away!
389,CONTENTS,
390,CONTENTS,
391,CONTENTS,
392,CONTENTS,
393,CONTENTS,
394,CONTENTS,"""I am Weary, let me Sleep"""
395,CONTENTS,
396,CONTENTS,"I am weary, let me sleep"
397,CONTENTS,"In some great embroidered bed,"
398,CONTENTS,With soft pillows for my head.
399,CONTENTS,"I am weary, let me sleep . . ."
400,CONTENTS,Petals of sweet roses shed
401,CONTENTS,All around a perfumed heap
402,CONTENTS,"White as pearls, and ruby red;"
403,CONTENTS,Curtains closely drawn to keep
404,CONTENTS,Wings of darkness o'er me spread . . .
405,CONTENTS,"I am weary, let me sleep"
406,CONTENTS,In some great embroidered bed.
407,CONTENTS,"Let me dream that I am dead,"
408,CONTENTS,Nevermore to wake and weep
409,CONTENTS,In the future that I dread . . .
410,CONTENTS,For the ways of life are steep . . .
411,CONTENTS,"I am weary, let me sleep . . ."
412,CONTENTS,
413,CONTENTS,
414,CONTENTS,
415,CONTENTS,
416,CONTENTS,
417,CONTENTS,Grief
418,CONTENTS,
419,CONTENTS,"I, that was once so eager for the light,"
420,CONTENTS,"The vehement pomp and passion of the day,"
421,CONTENTS,"Am tired at last, and glad to steal away"
422,CONTENTS,Across the dusky borders of the night.
423,CONTENTS,"The purple darkness now is my delight,"
424,CONTENTS,"And with great stars my lonely sorrows play,"
425,CONTENTS,"As still, some proud and tragic princess may"
426,CONTENTS,With diamonds make her desolation bright.
427,CONTENTS,
428,CONTENTS,Night has become a temple for my tears . . .
429,CONTENTS,"The moon a silver shroud for my despair,"
430,CONTENTS,And all the golden forests of the spheres
431,CONTENTS,Have showered their splendours on me leaf by leaf
432,CONTENTS,"Till men that meet me in the sunlight, stare"
433,CONTENTS,To see the shining garment of my grief!
434,CONTENTS,
435,CONTENTS,
436,CONTENTS,
437,CONTENTS,
438,CONTENTS,
439,CONTENTS,Daffodil Dawn
440,CONTENTS,
441,CONTENTS,"While I slept, and dreamed of you,"
442,CONTENTS,"Morning, like a princess, came,"
443,CONTENTS,All in robe of palest blue:
444,CONTENTS,Stooped and gathered in that hour
445,CONTENTS,"From the east a golden flower,"
446,CONTENTS,Great and shining flower of flame . . .
447,CONTENTS,Then she hastened on her way
448,CONTENTS,Singing over plain and hill--
449,CONTENTS,While I slept and dreamed of you
450,CONTENTS,Dreams that never can come true . .
451,CONTENTS,"Morning at the gates of Day,"
452,CONTENTS,"Gathered Dawn, the daffodil!"
453,CONTENTS,
454,CONTENTS,
455,CONTENTS,
456,CONTENTS,
457,CONTENTS,
458,CONTENTS,Beauty
459,CONTENTS,
460,CONTENTS,I saw the face of Beauty--a pale rose
461,CONTENTS,In the gold dusk of her abundant hair . . .
462,CONTENTS,A silken web of dreams and joys--a snare . .
463,CONTENTS,"A net of pleasures in a world of woes,"
464,CONTENTS,A bright temptation for gay youth that goes
465,CONTENTS,Laughing upon his way without a care!
466,CONTENTS,A shield of light for conquering Love to bear
467,CONTENTS,Stronger than all the swords of all his foes.
468,CONTENTS,
469,CONTENTS,O face of Beauty--O white dawn enshrined
470,CONTENTS,In sunrise veils of splendid hair--O star!
471,CONTENTS,Shine on those weary men who sadly wise
472,CONTENTS,But guess thy glory faintly from afar--
473,CONTENTS,Missing the marvel of thy smile--and blind
474,CONTENTS,To the imperial passion in thine eyes!
475,CONTENTS,
476,CONTENTS,
477,CONTENTS,
478,CONTENTS,
479,CONTENTS,
480,CONTENTS,The Vision
481,CONTENTS,
482,CONTENTS,"I come from lonely downs and silent woods,"
483,CONTENTS,"With winter in my heart, a withered world,"
484,CONTENTS,"A heavy weight of dark and sorrowful things,"
485,CONTENTS,"And all my dreams spread out their rainbow wings,"
486,CONTENTS,And turn again to those bright solitudes
487,CONTENTS,"Where Beauty met me in a thousand moods,"
488,CONTENTS,And all her shining banners were unfurled . . .
489,CONTENTS,And where I snatched from the sweet hands of Spring
490,CONTENTS,"A crystal cup and drank a mystic wine,"
491,CONTENTS,"And walked alone a secret perfumed way,"
492,CONTENTS,And saw the glittering Angels at their play.
493,CONTENTS,"And heard the golden birds of Heaven sing,"
494,CONTENTS,And woke . . . to find white lilies clustering
495,CONTENTS,"And all the emerald wood an empty shrine,"
496,CONTENTS,"Fragrant with myrrh and frankincense and spice,"
497,CONTENTS,And echoing yet the flutes of Paradise . . .
498,CONTENTS,
499,CONTENTS,
500,CONTENTS,
501,CONTENTS,
502,CONTENTS,
503,CONTENTS,The Dance
504,CONTENTS,
505,CONTENTS,"Do you remember that day I danced in the woods,"
506,CONTENTS,Under the dancing leaves?
507,CONTENTS,Do you remember the delicate blue of the sky
508,CONTENTS,And the gold-dust in the air?
509,CONTENTS,"And the tawny harvest fields, and the heavy sheaves?"
510,CONTENTS,Summer was surely in one of her bravest moods . . .

890,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,O youth and dawn . . . you dreamed not of the night . . .
891,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,O life and laughter . . . but the night is long . . .

897,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,Blue Flowers
898,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
899,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,I go to gather in the woods for you
900,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,The wild flowers that are blue . . .
901,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,Petals to match the colour of your eyes!
902,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
903,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"None but blue blossoms will I take, yet see"
904,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,How sweetly tempting me
905,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,The fruit trees swing their scented treasuries.
906,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
907,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,And how the buttercups and daisies dance
908,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,To meet my dazzled glance!
909,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"But gold and silver, Sweet, are naught to you."
910,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
911,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,And so let others rob God's gardens . . . shake
912,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,The stars down for your sake--
913,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,I bring you but the wild flowers that are blue!

920,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
921,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,Rare garden where my heart goes gathering
922,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"Many a lovely and delightful thing,"
923,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,Pale roses of your body and the fair
924,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,Unrivalled yellow blossoms of your hair!
925,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
926,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"Tall lilies of your gay and careless grace,"
927,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,And O the wistful flower of your face!
928,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,And all the soft and starry mysteries
929,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"Of those divine forget-me-nots, your eyes . . ."
930,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
931,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"O come, fair Love, before the flowers fade,"
932,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,And bless this garden that the gods have made . . .
933,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,Rare garden where my heart goes gathering
934,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,Many a lovely and delightful thing . . .
935,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,

940,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,Endymion
941,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
942,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,Your hair was like a honey-coloured flame
943,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,Seen through a veil of silver when you came
944,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,And took me in your arms that winter night . . .
945,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"The moonlight, amorous of your golden hair,"
946,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"Toyed with it softly, as a woman might"
947,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"With some bright treasure, delicate and rare."
948,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
949,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"O, young Endymion, risen from the dead,"
950,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"Born once again to beauty, O bright head!"
951,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"The moon stoops low to kiss you, as of old;"
952,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"Stoops graciously from her great throne of pearl,"
953,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,With outstretched arms mysterious and cold . . .
954,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,But you have left her for a mortal girl.
955,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
956,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
957,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
958,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,

960,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,Dance Song
961,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
962,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,O hide your passion from the moon.
963,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,When young and slender she appears
964,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,In shining gown and silver shoon . . .
965,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"And, all her path with stars impearled,"
966,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,She dances round the darkened world.
967,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
968,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,O hide your sorrows from the sun . . .
969,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,The sun should never see your tears!
970,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"Weep, if you will, when day is done . . ."
971,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,But laugh and sing and clap your hands
972,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,While yet the sun in heaven stands.
973,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
974,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
975,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
976,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,

978,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,A Memory
979,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
980,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,O how I loved you when we met
981,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,For that one moment of the day!
982,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"Yes, loved you desperately, and yet"
983,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,Could scarcely find a word to say--
984,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,No wonder that you looked and smiled
985,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,As though upon some timid child.
986,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"You never guessed, how could you guess"
987,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,That I adored your loveliness!
988,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
989,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,You never saw the prisoned soul
990,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"Behind the windows of my eyes,"
991,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,Frantic to break from fate's control
992,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,And charm you with her flatteries . . .
993,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"And show you, your cold heart to move,"
994,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"The shining treasure of her love,"
995,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"And worship in a long embrace,"
996,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,The reckless beauty of your face!
997,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
998,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,You never knew . . . and the dream died
999,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,A broken rose beneath your feet . . .
1000,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,You went your way . . . the world is wide
1001,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"And I forgot, for youth is sweet . . ."
1002,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"Yet when at night I lie awake,"
1003,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"My heart is sad for a dream's sake,"
1004,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,And I remember and regret . . .
1005,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,O how I loved you when we met!
1006,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
1007,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,

1012,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
1013,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"O Beauty, what is this?"
1014,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,A shadow of your face . . .
1015,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,Where is the wild flower grace
1016,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,That Love is wont to kiss?
1017,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
1018,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,Where is the bird that brings
1019,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,To your untroubled eyes
1020,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"The blue of fairy skies,"
1021,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,The flash of fairy wings? . . .
1022,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
1023,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"O wild bird of delight,"
1024,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"That no white hand may hold,"
1025,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,Or fairest cage of gold . . .
1026,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,For who would stay its flight?
1027,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
1028,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,The song-bird of your voice
1029,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"Whose magic song Love hears,"
1030,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"Trembling behind your tears,"
1031,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,Trilling when you rejoice . . .
1032,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
1033,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"O Beauty, what is this?"
1034,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,The shadow of a rose . . .
1035,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,A little ghost that goes
1036,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,Oblivious of Love's kiss.
1037,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
1038,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,Only a shadow . . . yet
1039,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"It may, in some dark hour"
1040,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,Recall the living flower . . .
1041,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,If haply Love forget.
1042,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,

1048,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
1049,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,So beautiful in all thine agony!
1050,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,So radiant in thine infinite despair . . .
1051,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"Oh, delicate mouth, brave eyes, and curled bright hair . . ."
1052,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"Oh, lovely body lashed to the rough tree:"
1053,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,What brutal fools were those that gave to thee
1054,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"Red roses of thine outraged blood to wear,"
1055,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,Laughed at thy bitter pain and loathed the fair
1056,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,Bruised flower of thy victorious purity?
1057,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
1058,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"Marvellous Beauty . . . target of the world,"
1059,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"How all Love's arrows seek thy joy, Oh Sweet!"
1060,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,And wound the white perfection of thy youth!
1061,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,How all the poisoned spears of hate are hurled
1062,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,Against thy sorrow when thou darest to meet
1063,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,With martyrdom men's mockery of the truth!
1064,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,

1070,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,
1071,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"In the dim mirrors of imagination,"
1072,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,I watch the silent dancing of my soul . . .
1073,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,I watch her as she dances with my dreams . . .
1074,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"See how she takes innumerable disguises,"
1075,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"And hides her beauty behind many masks,"
1076,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"And how, sometimes, she seems to laugh and sing,"
1077,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,. . . And weep . . . and call upon the unknown Gods . . .
1078,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"But not one mirror has betrayed her voice,"
1079,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,Or shown to me the secret of her face . . .
1080,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"O silent dance of sorrow and delight,"
1081,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,"My heart grown tired with watching, turns away,"
1082,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,To make perhaps a little passionate song
1083,THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER,Out of the shadows of immortal things . . .
