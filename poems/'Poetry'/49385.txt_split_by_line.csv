103,MAY 1915,
104,MAY 1915,_In twenty years of lands and seas and cities
105,MAY 1915,"I had small joy and sought for it the more,"
106,MAY 1915,"Thinking: ""If ever I am polymêtis,"
107,MAY 1915,"'Tis yours to draw upon the hard-won store.""_"
108,MAY 1915,
109,MAY 1915,"_I had some bouts from Samarkand to Paris,"
110,MAY 1915,And took some falls 'twixt Sweden and Sudan.
111,MAY 1915,"If I was slow and patient learning parries,"
112,MAY 1915,I hoped to teach you when you were a man._
113,MAY 1915,
114,MAY 1915,_I cannot fall to whining round the threshold
115,MAY 1915,Where Death awaited you. I lack the skill
116,MAY 1915,Of hands for ever working out a fresh hold
117,MAY 1915,On life. In mystic ways I serve you still._
118,MAY 1915,
119,MAY 1915,_The age of miracles is not yet ended.
120,MAY 1915,As on the humble feast of Galilee
121,MAY 1915,Surely a touch of heaven has descended
122,MAY 1915,"On the cheap earthen vessel, even on me,_"
123,MAY 1915,
124,MAY 1915,_Whose weak content--the soul I travail under--
125,MAY 1915,"Unstable as water, to myself untrue,"
126,MAY 1915,"God's mercy makes an everlasting wonder,"
127,MAY 1915,"Stronger than life or death, my love of you._"

132,MAY 1915,"I am indebted to Mr. Arthur Humphreys, Mr. John Murray, and the"
133,MAY 1915,Editor of the _Spectator_ for kind permission to reproduce a few of
134,MAY 1915,the shorter poems in this tale of Persian mystics. I have included
135,MAY 1915,"them, firstly, because I wished otherwise new work, being a memorial,"
136,MAY 1915,to include such fragments of the past as might be worth preserving;
137,MAY 1915,"secondly, because decreasing leisure inspires a diffidence in the"
138,MAY 1915,future that may justify me in asking a reader or a friend to judge or
139,MAY 1915,"remember me only by ""Foolery"" and ""The Singing Caravan."""

205,PRELUDE,The sun smote Elburz like a gong.
206,PRELUDE,Slow down the mountain's molten face
207,PRELUDE,Zigzagged the caravan of song.
208,PRELUDE,Time was its slave and went its pace.
209,PRELUDE,
210,PRELUDE,It bore a white Transcaspian Queen
211,PRELUDE,Whose barque had touched at Enzelí.
212,PRELUDE,Splendid in jewelled palanquin
213,PRELUDE,"She cleft Iran from sea to sea,"
214,PRELUDE,
215,PRELUDE,"Bound for the Persian Gulf of Pearls,"
216,PRELUDE,Where demons sail for drifting isles
217,PRELUDE,With bodyguards of dancing girls
218,PRELUDE,"And four tamed winds for music, smiles"
219,PRELUDE,
220,PRELUDE,"For passports. Thus the caravan,"
221,PRELUDE,"Singing from chief to _charvadar_,"
222,PRELUDE,Reached the great gate of screened Tehran.
223,PRELUDE,The burrows of the dim bazaar
224,PRELUDE,
225,PRELUDE,Swarmed thick to see the vision pass
226,PRELUDE,On broidered camels like a fleet
227,PRELUDE,Of swaying silence. One there was
228,PRELUDE,Who joined the strangers in the street.
229,PRELUDE,
230,PRELUDE,"They called him Dreamer-of-the-Age,"
231,PRELUDE,The least of Allah's _Muslimeen_
232,PRELUDE,Who knew the joys of pilgrimage
233,PRELUDE,"And wore the sign of sacred green,"
234,PRELUDE,
235,PRELUDE,"A poet, poor and wistful-eyed."
236,PRELUDE,Him all the beauty and the song
237,PRELUDE,"Drew by swift magic to her side,"
238,PRELUDE,And in a trance he went along
239,PRELUDE,
240,PRELUDE,Past friends who questioned of his goal:
241,PRELUDE,"""The Brazen Cliffs? The Realms of Musk?"
242,PRELUDE,"Goes he to Mecca for his soul?..."""
243,PRELUDE,The town-light dwindled in the dusk
244,PRELUDE,
245,PRELUDE,Behind. Ahead Misr? El Katíf?
246,PRELUDE,The moon far up a brine-green sky
247,PRELUDE,Made Demavend a huge pale reef
248,PRELUDE,Set in an ocean long gone dry.
249,PRELUDE,
250,PRELUDE,"Bleached mosques like dwarf cave-stalagmites,"
251,PRELUDE,Smooth silver-bouldered _biyaban_
252,PRELUDE,And sevenfold velvet of white nights
253,PRELUDE,Vied with the singing caravan
254,PRELUDE,
255,PRELUDE,To make her pathway plain.
256,PRELUDE,Then one
257,PRELUDE,Beside the poet murmured low:
258,PRELUDE,"""I plod behind, sun after sun,"
259,PRELUDE,"O master, whither do we go?"
260,PRELUDE,
261,PRELUDE,"""Are we for some palmed port of Fars,"
262,PRELUDE,"Or tombed Kerbela, or Baghdad"
263,PRELUDE,The Town-of-Knowledge-of-the-Stars?
264,PRELUDE,"Is worship wise or are we mad?"""
265,PRELUDE,
266,PRELUDE,"Answered the poet: ""Do we ask"
267,PRELUDE,Allah to buy each Friday's throng?
268,PRELUDE,None to whom worship is a task
269,PRELUDE,Should join the caravan of song.
270,PRELUDE,
271,PRELUDE,"""With heart and eyes unquestioning, friend,"
272,PRELUDE,"We follow love from sea to sea,"
273,PRELUDE,And Love and Prayer have common end:
274,PRELUDE,"'May God be merciful to me!'"""
275,PRELUDE,
276,PRELUDE,"So fared they, camped from noon to even,"
277,PRELUDE,"Till dawn, quick-groping through the gloom,"
278,PRELUDE,Pounced on gilt planets low in heaven.
279,PRELUDE,Thus they beheld the domes of Kum.
280,PRELUDE,
281,PRELUDE,And onward nightly. Though the dust
282,PRELUDE,"Swirled in dread shapes of desert _Jinn_,"
283,PRELUDE,Ever the footsore poet's trust
284,PRELUDE,"Soared to the jewelled palanquin,"
285,PRELUDE,
286,PRELUDE,"Parched, but still singing: ""God, being great,"
287,PRELUDE,"Lent me a star from sea to sea,"
288,PRELUDE,"The drop in his hand-hollow, Fate."
289,PRELUDE,"He holds it high, and signs to me"
290,PRELUDE,
291,PRELUDE,"""Although She--She may not ..."""
292,PRELUDE,"""For thirst"
293,PRELUDE,My songs and dreams like mirage fail.
294,PRELUDE,"Yea, mad ""--his fellow pilgrim cursed--"
295,PRELUDE,"""I was. The Queen lifts not her veil."""
296,PRELUDE,
297,PRELUDE,"""Put no conditions to her glance,"
298,PRELUDE,"O happy desert, where the guide"
299,PRELUDE,"Is Love's own self, Life's only chance ..."""
300,PRELUDE,"He saw not where the other died,"
301,PRELUDE,
302,PRELUDE,"But pressed on strongly, loth to halt"
303,PRELUDE,"At Persia's pride, Rose-Ispahan,"
304,PRELUDE,Whose hawks are bathed in pure cobalt.
305,PRELUDE,To meet the singing caravan
306,PRELUDE,
307,PRELUDE,Came henna-bearded prince and sage
308,PRELUDE,"With henna-fingered _houris_, who"
309,PRELUDE,"Strove to retard the pilgrimage,"
310,PRELUDE,"Saying: ""Our streets are fair and you"
311,PRELUDE,
312,PRELUDE,"""A poet. Sing of us instead."
313,PRELUDE,"God may be good, but life is short."
314,PRELUDE,Yon are the mountains of the dead.
315,PRELUDE,"Here are clean robes to wear at court."""
316,PRELUDE,
317,PRELUDE,"He said: ""I seek a bliss beyond"
318,PRELUDE,The range of your _muezzin_-call.
319,PRELUDE,Do birds cease song till heaven respond?
320,PRELUDE,"The road is naught. The Hope is all."""
321,PRELUDE,
322,PRELUDE,"""You know not this Transcaspian Queen,"
323,PRELUDE,Or what the journey's end may be.
324,PRELUDE,"Fool among Allah's _Muslimeen_,"
325,PRELUDE,"You chase a myth from sea to sea."""
326,PRELUDE,
327,PRELUDE,"""Because I bargain not nor guess"
328,PRELUDE,"If Waste or Garden wait for me,"
329,PRELUDE,Love gives me inner loveliness.
330,PRELUDE,"I hold to her from sea to sea."""
331,PRELUDE,
332,PRELUDE,"So he was gone, nor seemed to care"
333,PRELUDE,"For beckoning shade, or boasting brook,"
334,PRELUDE,Or human alabaster-ware
335,PRELUDE,"Flaunted before him in the _suk_,"
336,PRELUDE,
337,PRELUDE,"Nor paused at sunburnt far Shiraz,"
338,PRELUDE,"The home of sinful yellow wine,"
339,PRELUDE,"Where morning mists, like violet gauze,"
340,PRELUDE,"Deck the bare hills, and blossoms twine"
341,PRELUDE,
342,PRELUDE,In seething coloured foam around
343,PRELUDE,The lighthouse minarets.
344,PRELUDE,And sheer--
345,PRELUDE,A thin cascade bereft of sound--
346,PRELUDE,The track falls down to dank Bushír.
347,PRELUDE,
348,PRELUDE,The caravan slipped to the plain.
349,PRELUDE,"Its song rose through the rising damp,"
350,PRELUDE,"Till, through the grey stockade of rain,"
351,PRELUDE,The Gulf of Pearls shone like a lamp.
352,PRELUDE,
353,PRELUDE,"Here waiting rode a giant _dhow_,"
354,PRELUDE,"Each hand a captive _Roumi_ lord,"
355,PRELUDE,Who rose despite his chains to bow
356,PRELUDE,"As straight her beauty went aboard,"
357,PRELUDE,
358,PRELUDE,Sailed. For the Tableland of Rhyme?
359,PRELUDE,The Crystal Archipelago?
360,PRELUDE,Who knows! This happened on a time
361,PRELUDE,Among the times of long ago.
362,PRELUDE,
363,PRELUDE,"He only, Dreamer-of-the-Age,"
364,PRELUDE,"Was left alone upon the sands,"
365,PRELUDE,"The goal of his long pilgrimage,"
366,PRELUDE,"The soil of all the promised lands,"
367,PRELUDE,
368,PRELUDE,Watching the _dhow_ cut like a sword
369,PRELUDE,"The leaden waves. Yet, ere she sailed,"
370,PRELUDE,God poured on broken eyes reward
371,PRELUDE,Out of Heaven's heart.
372,PRELUDE,The Queen unveiled.
373,PRELUDE,
374,PRELUDE,"There for a space fulfilment shone,"
375,PRELUDE,While worship had his soul for priest
376,PRELUDE,"And altar. Then the light was gone,"
377,PRELUDE,And on the sea the singing ceased.
378,PRELUDE,
379,PRELUDE,*       *       *       *       *
380,PRELUDE,
381,PRELUDE,"And is this all my story? Yes,"
382,PRELUDE,Save that the _Sufi's_ dream is true.
383,PRELUDE,"Dearest, in its deep lowliness"
384,PRELUDE,This tale is told of me and you.
385,PRELUDE,
386,PRELUDE,"O love of mine, while I have breath,"
387,PRELUDE,"Whatever my last fate shall be,"
388,PRELUDE,"I seek you, you alone, till death"
389,PRELUDE,With all my life--from sea to sea.
390,PRELUDE,And God be merciful to me.

3425,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
3426,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,Henceforth impatient ups and downs possessed us. Asiatic towns

3453,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,had flown.
3454,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
3455,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,I think Alexius was wise to keep us out. Our hungry eyes
3456,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,Fixed on his capital. Why go farther when here were rich supplies?
3457,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
3458,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,The Pope that cursed our tastes had laid the hand of blessing on

3470,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
3471,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,The notion twinged us. We compared our prospects with the way we
3472,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,fared
3473,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,On these lean suburbs and the flats about Barbyses. We were snared!
3474,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
3475,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"The very Greeks, whose prayers had lured us into this adventure,"
3476,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,lodged
3477,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"Their saviours in a baited trap. Lord, how these foxes turned and"

3479,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
3480,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"There lay our army like a log; our camp, our tenets, turned to bog."
3481,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,We sank. Disorder brought disease that stalked us spectral through

3484,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,The Greeks we came to bolster up against their weakness filled our

3486,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,With turpitude; the Byzantine put Circe's poison in our wine.
3487,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
3488,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,Our aspirations all became mean as our hosts; the inner flame
3489,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,Went out. From many a starting-point we found a common ground in

3492,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"For here no soul can keep its health, but cat-like honour creeps by"

3496,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
3497,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,Between our fellow-churches rose the hate that heaven had meant for
3498,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,foes....
3499,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,The infidel might well have laughed. Perhaps he did. We came to
3500,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,blows.
3501,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
3502,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"And I was sad that Christians had nothing in common, saving bad"

3508,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"We crossed to Asia sick at heart. Alexius kept us well apart,"
3509,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
3510,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,Shuffling us o'er the Bosphorus. The number and the rank of us
3511,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,Exceeded those who went to Troy for Helen the Adulterous.
3512,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
3513,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,On the Bithynian plain our force drew up: an hundred thousand horse
3514,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,With foot and monks and womankind in crowds that none can call to

3516,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
3517,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,Fear stuffed the empty space ahead with devils and the shapes of
3518,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,dread
3519,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,That decked our church. A ghastly rush of loneliness made every
3520,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,head
3521,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
3522,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,Feel like a pinpoint. Discontent ran through the score of nations
3523,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,blent
3524,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,In cries. Their ribald spokesman forced a drunkard's way to

3574,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,Calling for bread. The peasants fled. We swept the country like a

3583,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"Our leaders swore, went on before us. I saw nothing but the Rhone,"
3584,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
3585,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"The impulsive Rhone that tumbles down, and breaks clean through the"

3603,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"The preacher said Jehovah's cloud and pillar would go with us. Yea,"
3604,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"The sky was on our heads alway. The sun rose up and cried aloud,"
3605,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
3606,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,And stood immobilized at noon. We wondered if at Ajalon

3609,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"We came to Nice and formed a siege with tortoise, belfry, catapult,"

3625,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
3626,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,I well recall our knights' first charge. It was as though a loaded

3631,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,Our men returned with horses spent. It seemed the Turkish cowards

3635,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
3636,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,Strange that within so short a space I felt the strong effects of

3651,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
3652,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"We had our fill at Dorylæum. Our rogues were Paladins. We won,"
3653,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"And weighed our booty by the ton. That night we chanted a Te Deum,"
3654,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
3655,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,A myriad voices in the dark; they rose like one colossal lark
3656,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,Ere dawn. My soul flew up with them to see the new Jerusalem

3658,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"And spite my tutor. I was mad to be a fighting-man, would pad"
3659,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,My arms like muscles. So my lord took me to foray. I was glad.
3660,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,

4379,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"A little while and we were penned, and yet a little while a breach"
4380,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4381,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"Was made. Jehovah's chosen seat was tottering, but no Paraclete"
4382,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,Came down to comfort us. I made some sallies. Then the Queen would
4383,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,treat.
4384,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4385,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"Perhaps in our appeal for ruth my wording stumbled on the truth,"
4386,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"""One God that went by many names,"" or else I knew Him in my youth,"
4387,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4388,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"Or else that Sufi haunted me with something that I could not see,"
4389,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,Something that only had not been because we would not let it be.
4390,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4391,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"And when the foe marched in, I own that I was thinking of the Rhone"
4392,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"Long, long ago, and wondering--a child once more--if it had grown."
4393,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4394,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,Yet there remained the sharpest cup to drain: the moan of us went
4395,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"up,"
4396,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,When from the topmost dome was hurled the Sign that should have
4397,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,ruled the world.
4398,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4399,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"Down, down it rumbled with our grand designs. All we had built or"
4400,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"planned,"
4401,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"Toiled, bled for, crumbled at a touch, was ruined like a house of"
4402,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,sand.
4403,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4404,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"So soon we pass. The wind knows why. The efforts of a century,"
4405,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,Three generations' handiwork failed in the twinkling of an eye.
4406,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4407,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,And I was sad to think that shadows occupy us all. I had
4408,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,No hope of earth. What boots a toy that thinks its maker raving
4409,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,mad?
4410,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4411,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"My soul had passed through every phase and, counting forty thousand"
4412,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"days,"
4413,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,Was farther off than at the start from comprehending heaven's ways
4414,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4415,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,Or bowing to them. I came nearest when I pressed my childish ear
4416,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,Earthward through briar and bramble bowers to catch the singing of
4417,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,the flowers.
4418,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4419,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"The last remains of faith were shaken when I, the oracle, was"
4420,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,taken.
4421,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,My pride was made to sleep in chains. I prayed that I might never
4422,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"waken,"
4423,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4424,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"But woke. They gave me to a _rais_ who wanted cattle, not advice."
4425,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,He flogged me down to Damietta. I was old and fetched no price.
4426,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4427,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,Nathless my battling heart was brave enough to work me till I
4428,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,dropped.
4429,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,I passed for twopence to a Copt who sold me as a galley-slave
4430,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4431,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"To Muscat. In the rhythmic stroke, old, undefeated, gnarled as oak"
4432,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"I creaked and strained against my fate, until that Sufi-something"
4433,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,broke.
4434,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4435,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"'Twas not my heart. An inner morn put the dark age in me to scorn,"
4436,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"And in the light I found myself, a child at play with worlds"
4437,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"unborn,"
4438,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4439,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"For all that I had thought and read, and fought and watched the"
4440,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,world be led
4441,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"By any who contrived to cut a knot with that blunt tool, the head."
4442,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4443,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,I laughed to think how sparrows might look down upon our highest
4444,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"flight,"
4445,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"While each succeeding age would have its oracle or stagyrite,"
4446,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4447,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"Would trace the good we never did, the evil that we never saw,"
4448,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,And out of our blind pyramid extract a stepping-stone to Law.
4449,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4450,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"Here, where ambition had to cease in servitude, I tasted peace,"
4451,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,Free of illusion stretched and yawned. A fool would clamour for
4452,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,release.
4453,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4454,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"I make the rowers' bench a throne to think, and thought implies"
4455,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"Alone,"
4456,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,Of changing woods and endless streams. My happiness is all my own.
4457,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4458,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"And often, when my mates deplore a brother who shall row no more,"
4459,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"I talk about my wolf-cub, Life. They think I speak in metaphor."
4460,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4461,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"They gather round me all agog, they think a chronicle and log"
4462,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,Of Progress lies in withered hands. Their cry is for an epilogue.
4463,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4464,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"Has aught been drafted yet? A blot, an echo void and polyglot."
4465,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"Each century is written off as preface. Yes, most true.... Of what?"
4466,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4467,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,My gathered weight had held me bound to find for every fog a
4468,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"ground,"
4469,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"For every riddle a reply, an end to Being that goes round."
4470,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4471,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"Now I can say, I do not know if there will be a book at all,"
4472,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"Or if the deepest chapters go beyond some writing on the wall,"
4473,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4474,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"Though wiser worlds will yet embark, sworn to eclipse our sorry"
4475,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"trades,"

4477,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"fades,"
4478,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4479,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,Fresh undergrowths of formulæ. Through these no _human_ eye can see
4480,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"The open glade--the _last_ crusade, in which Jerusalem might be"
4481,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4482,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"The symbol of all peopled space, and Time an emblem of the day"
4483,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,On which the nations march as one to liberate and not to slay.
4484,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4485,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,A story has no finish when it leads to nowhere out of ken?
4486,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,"O friend, the lack of knowledge brings wisdom within the reach of"
4487,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,men;
4488,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,
4489,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,For whether hope can ever fit the future matters not a whit.
4490,THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURER,My duty is to tug my oar--so long as I am chained to it.

4499,FUSION,
4500,FUSION,It was fulfilled. The giant _dhow_ bestirred
4501,FUSION,"Herself, burst from her slender moorings, ran"
4502,FUSION,Exulting on her course beyond the green
4503,FUSION,Thin shallows to the deeper violet
4504,FUSION,Of that great gem wherein the continents
4505,FUSION,Are flaws. With creaking oars and fluttering sails
4506,FUSION,The wingèd ghost swept outward. On the prow
4507,FUSION,"Unveiled the Queen stood whiter than the sails,"
4508,FUSION,And save the revelation made no sign;
4509,FUSION,And all the sound of singing was brought low.
4510,FUSION,"Then, as the vision vanished in the hushed"
4511,FUSION,"Twilight that painted out the caravan,"
4512,FUSION,Leaving the pilgrims but a _burnûs_-blur
4513,FUSION,"On the drab canvas of the shore, a wail"
4514,FUSION,"Rose, and to them the Dreamer's last reply:"
4515,FUSION,
4516,FUSION,"""The aimless spindrift mingles with the scats"
4517,FUSION,Where suddenly the desert is the beach.
4518,FUSION,A low wind whimpers up and down the flats
4519,FUSION,Seeking some obstacle to lend it speech.
4520,FUSION,
4521,FUSION,"""The sky bleeds pale as from a mortal wound,"
4522,FUSION,Darkening the waters. To a treble E
4523,FUSION,Gulls stiffly wheel their nomad escort round
4524,FUSION,A white sail dwindling in the impassive sea.
4525,FUSION,
4526,FUSION,"""A last beam smites it with a benison."
4527,FUSION,The lantern twinkles fainter at its mast.
4528,FUSION,"It bears the purpose in me that is gone,"
4529,FUSION,"The only thing that cannot be, the past."
4530,FUSION,
4531,FUSION,"""Let there be night. Shall evensong complain?"
4532,FUSION,My love was utter. Now I seek no sign.
4533,FUSION,"Mine eyes have seen, and shall not see again."
4534,FUSION,Out of the deep shall call no voice of mine.
4535,FUSION,
4536,FUSION,"""Yet I, whose happiness is hidden from view,"
4537,FUSION,"Have climbed the hill and touched eternity,"
4538,FUSION,"And Pisgah is a memory--of you,"
4539,FUSION,"A white sail sinking in the summer sea."""
4540,FUSION,
4541,FUSION,"The ship drove spaceward to the skyline's crater,"
4542,FUSION,"The last of day flared vibrant as a cry,"
4543,FUSION,And in the Dreamer Emptiness loomed greater
4544,FUSION,Than the unrifted pumice of the sky.
4545,FUSION,
4546,FUSION,He turned to see the friends whose hope had ended
4547,FUSION,Like his beside the gulf. He was alone.
4548,FUSION,The singers and the glory that had blended
4549,FUSION,"With meaner notes and lowly, all were gone"
4550,FUSION,
4551,FUSION,"Into thin air. But, patient of his tether,"
4552,FUSION,"Enduring as the dream he would not break,"
4553,FUSION,Only old Tous remained. As back together
4554,FUSION,"They fared, once more it seemed the camel spake:"
4555,FUSION,
4556,FUSION,"""Lo, these the fleeting and the true,"
4557,FUSION,"The keen to sacrifice and slow,"
4558,FUSION,"The plumed, the crawling, all were You"
4559,FUSION,That started hither long ago.
4560,FUSION,"For man is many when begun,"
4561,FUSION,But Love can weave his ends to one.
4562,FUSION,
4563,FUSION,"""The new, the ancient, song and prose,"
4564,FUSION,"The lower road, the higher aim,"
4565,FUSION,"The clean, the draggled, dust and snows"
4566,FUSION,"Were you the striving, you the same."
4567,FUSION,"Pride and endeavour, love and loss,"
4568,FUSION,The pattern is the threads that cross.
4569,FUSION,
4570,FUSION,"""Tilth, waste and water, sand and sap,"
4571,FUSION,"Tare, thorn and thistle, wine and oil,"
4572,FUSION,"Run through _your_ Nature like a map,"
4573,FUSION,Are YOU. The ores that vein the soil
4574,FUSION,Of time and substance manifold
4575,FUSION,"Await the hour that makes them gold,"
4576,FUSION,
4577,FUSION,"""That found the force of you dispersed"
4578,FUSION,"On all adventure save a quest,"
4579,FUSION,And part perhaps was on the worst.
4580,FUSION,"It sent you all upon the best,"
4581,FUSION,Wherein the journey is the goal.
4582,FUSION,Now leaving you they leave you whole.
4583,FUSION,
4584,FUSION,"""The rabble melts, but more remains:"
4585,FUSION,The golden opportunity
4586,FUSION,By which the choir in us attains
4587,FUSION,Not unison but unity.
4588,FUSION,"We feel the sunbeam, not the motes."
4589,FUSION,The Voice is made of many notes.
4590,FUSION,
4591,FUSION,"""Slave, merchant, scholar, fighting-man,"
4592,FUSION,"The gambling, stumbling, praying kith"
4593,FUSION,"We called the Singing Caravan,"
4594,FUSION,Have made their song at least no myth
4595,FUSION,Not dawn to which yon skylark soared
4596,FUSION,But earth is his and your reward.
4597,FUSION,
4598,FUSION,"""The story ends, but not the book."
4599,FUSION,"Sufi, the Queen that you ensued"
4600,FUSION,Led and shall lead you still to look
4601,FUSION,On peace--it is not solitude.
4602,FUSION,"Through her your warring kingdoms met,"
4603,FUSION,"And here is room for no regret."""
4604,FUSION,
4605,FUSION,So Dreamer-of-the-Age returned
4606,FUSION,"With comfort, all his being fused"
4607,FUSION,"At last, and thus at night he mused"
4608,FUSION,Beside the fire that in him burned:
4609,FUSION,
4610,FUSION,"""Heirs of the beauty yet to be,"
4611,FUSION,"Hail, from however far ahead"
4612,FUSION,Or out of sight I hear you tread
4613,FUSION,The dust that made this tale and me.
4614,FUSION,
4615,FUSION,"""Each day shall raise me to rejoice"
4616,FUSION,That lovers such as we must bear
4617,FUSION,The unbroken chain of life and share
4618,FUSION,Its thanksgiving. Perhaps my voice
4619,FUSION,
4620,FUSION,"""Shall be the servant of your mind,"
4621,FUSION,Your linkman waiting in the arch
4622,FUSION,Of phantom city-gates to march
4623,FUSION,With you by secret ways. The wind
4624,FUSION,
4625,FUSION,"""Shall tell me of you, he and I"
4626,FUSION,"Be keenly with you, when you go"
4627,FUSION,Forth in my footsteps and the glow
4628,FUSION,"Of movement, steadfast to deny"
4629,FUSION,
4630,FUSION,"""Only the frailer self. My grief"
4631,FUSION,Shall answer your unspoken word
4632,FUSION,"Through blithe interpreters, a bird"
4633,FUSION,"Waking, the sounds of rill and leaf."
4634,FUSION,
4635,FUSION,"""By many a caravanserai"
4636,FUSION,"I shall not fail to watch you come,"
4637,FUSION,"You of some far millennium,"
4638,FUSION,"Who, listening to the bird, will say:"
4639,FUSION,
4640,FUSION,"""'I seem to know that tune of his;"
4641,FUSION,He sings what all can understand.'
4642,FUSION,In the clear water dip your hand:
4643,FUSION,'His deepest note was only this.'
4644,FUSION,
4645,FUSION,"""You shall be glad of me, the shade,"
4646,FUSION,Sighing 'O friend.' And I shall keep
4647,FUSION,The benediction of your sleep;
4648,FUSION,"And, when the woods of darkness fade,"
4649,FUSION,
4650,FUSION,"""Shall waken with you, I that had"
4651,FUSION,"Love to the full, and praised my lot,"
4652,FUSION,Trusting in truth to be forgot
4653,FUSION,"For worthier verse. Ah, make me glad,"
4654,FUSION,
4655,FUSION,"""You that come after me, and call"
4656,FUSION,From summits that outstrip my hopes.
4657,FUSION,Yet I shall linger on the slopes
4658,FUSION,"And dwell with those who gave their all."""
