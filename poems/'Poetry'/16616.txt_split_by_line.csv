76,HAVE GATHERED ON THE SECRET STREAMS.,
77,HAVE GATHERED ON THE SECRET STREAMS.,
78,HAVE GATHERED ON THE SECRET STREAMS.,"I thought, beloved, to have brought to you"
79,HAVE GATHERED ON THE SECRET STREAMS.,"A gift of quietness and ease and peace,"
80,HAVE GATHERED ON THE SECRET STREAMS.,Cooling your brow as with the mystic dew
81,HAVE GATHERED ON THE SECRET STREAMS.,Dropping from twilight trees.
82,HAVE GATHERED ON THE SECRET STREAMS.,
83,HAVE GATHERED ON THE SECRET STREAMS.,Homeward I go not yet; the darkness grows;
84,HAVE GATHERED ON THE SECRET STREAMS.,Not mine the voice to still with peace divine:
85,HAVE GATHERED ON THE SECRET STREAMS.,From the first fount the stream of quiet flows
86,HAVE GATHERED ON THE SECRET STREAMS.,Through other hearts than mine.
87,HAVE GATHERED ON THE SECRET STREAMS.,

96,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE
97,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,
98,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,
99,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,A cabin on the mountain side hid in a grassy nook
100,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,Where door and windows open wide that friendly stars may look.
101,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,"The rabbit shy can patter in, the winds may enter free,"
102,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,Who throng around the mountain throne in living ecstasy.
103,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,
104,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,"And when the sun sets dimmed in eve and purple fills the air,"
105,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,I think the sacred Hazel Tree is dropping berries there
106,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,From starry fruitage waved aloft where Connla's Well o'erflows;
107,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,For sure the enchanted waters pour through every wind that blows.
108,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,
109,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,I think when night towers up aloft and shakes the trembling dew
110,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,How every high and lonely thought that thrills my being through
111,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,"Is but a ruddy berry dropped down through the purple air,"
112,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,And from the magic tree of life the fruit falls everywhere.

117,IMMORTALITY,IMMORTALITY
118,IMMORTALITY,
119,IMMORTALITY,
120,IMMORTALITY,We must pass like smoke or live within the spirit's fire;
121,IMMORTALITY,For we can no more than smoke unto the flame return
122,IMMORTALITY,"If our thought has changed to dream, our will unto desire,"
123,IMMORTALITY,As smoke we vanish though the fire may burn.
124,IMMORTALITY,
125,IMMORTALITY,Lights of infinite pity star the grey dusk of our days:
126,IMMORTALITY,Surely here is soul: with it we have eternal breath:
127,IMMORTALITY,"In the fire of love we live, or pass by many ways,"
128,IMMORTALITY,By unnumbered ways of dream to death.
129,IMMORTALITY,

133,THE HERMIT,THE HERMIT
134,THE HERMIT,
135,THE HERMIT,
136,THE HERMIT,Now the quietude of earth
137,THE HERMIT,Nestles deep my heart within;
138,THE HERMIT,Friendships new and strange have birth
139,THE HERMIT,Since I left the city's din.
140,THE HERMIT,
141,THE HERMIT,"Here the tempest stays its guile,"
142,THE HERMIT,"Like a big kind brother plays,"
143,THE HERMIT,Romps and pauses here awhile
144,THE HERMIT,From its immemorial ways.
145,THE HERMIT,
146,THE HERMIT,Now the silver light of dawn
147,THE HERMIT,Slipping through the leaves that fleck
148,THE HERMIT,"My one window, hurries on,"
149,THE HERMIT,Throws its arms around my neck.
150,THE HERMIT,
151,THE HERMIT,"Darkness to my doorway hies,"
152,THE HERMIT,"Lays her chin upon the roof,"
153,THE HERMIT,And her burning seraph eyes
154,THE HERMIT,Now no longer keep aloof.
155,THE HERMIT,
156,THE HERMIT,Here the ancient mystery
157,THE HERMIT,"Holds its hands out day by day,"
158,THE HERMIT,Takes a chair and croons with me
159,THE HERMIT,By my cabin built of clay.
160,THE HERMIT,
161,THE HERMIT,"When the dusky shadow flits,"
162,THE HERMIT,By the chimney nook I see
163,THE HERMIT,"Where the old enchanter sits,"
164,THE HERMIT,"Smiles, and waves, and beckons me."
165,THE HERMIT,

169,THE GREAT BREATH,THE GREAT BREATH
170,THE GREAT BREATH,
171,THE GREAT BREATH,
172,THE GREAT BREATH,"Its edges foamed with amethyst and rose,"
173,THE GREAT BREATH,Withers once more the old blue flower of day:
174,THE GREAT BREATH,There where the ether like a diamond glows
175,THE GREAT BREATH,Its petals fade away.
176,THE GREAT BREATH,
177,THE GREAT BREATH,A shadowy tumult stirs the dusky air;
178,THE GREAT BREATH,"Sparkle the delicate dews, the distant snows;"
179,THE GREAT BREATH,The great deep thrills for through it everywhere
180,THE GREAT BREATH,The breath of beauty blows.
181,THE GREAT BREATH,
182,THE GREAT BREATH,"I saw how all the trembling ages past,"
183,THE GREAT BREATH,"Moulded to her by deep and deeper breath,"
184,THE GREAT BREATH,Neared to the hour when Beauty breathes her last
185,THE GREAT BREATH,And knows herself in death.
186,THE GREAT BREATH,
187,THE GREAT BREATH,
188,THE GREAT BREATH,
189,THE GREAT BREATH,
190,THE DIVINE VISION,THE DIVINE VISION
191,THE DIVINE VISION,
192,THE DIVINE VISION,
193,THE DIVINE VISION,This mood hath known all beauty for it sees
194,THE DIVINE VISION,O'erwhelmed majesties
195,THE DIVINE VISION,"In these pale forms, and kingly crowns of gold"
196,THE DIVINE VISION,"On brows no longer bold,"
197,THE DIVINE VISION,And through the shadowy terrors of their hell
198,THE DIVINE VISION,"The love for which they fell,"
199,THE DIVINE VISION,And how desire which cast them in the deep
200,THE DIVINE VISION,Called God too from his sleep.
201,THE DIVINE VISION,"O, pity, only seer, who looking through"
202,THE DIVINE VISION,"A heart melted like dew,"
203,THE DIVINE VISION,"Seest the long perished in the present thus,"
204,THE DIVINE VISION,For ever dwell in us.
205,THE DIVINE VISION,Whatever time thy golden eyelids ope
206,THE DIVINE VISION,They travel to a hope;
207,THE DIVINE VISION,Not only backward from these low degrees
208,THE DIVINE VISION,"To starry dynasties,"
209,THE DIVINE VISION,"But, looking far where now the silence owns"
210,THE DIVINE VISION,"And rules from empty thrones,"
211,THE DIVINE VISION,Thou seest the enchanted halls of heaven burn
212,THE DIVINE VISION,For joy at our return.
213,THE DIVINE VISION,Thy tender kiss hath memory we are kings
214,THE DIVINE VISION,For all our wanderings.
215,THE DIVINE VISION,Thy shining eyes already see the after
216,THE DIVINE VISION,In hidden light and laughter.
217,THE DIVINE VISION,

220,THE DIVINE VISION,
221,THE BURNING GLASS,THE BURNING GLASS
222,THE BURNING GLASS,
223,THE BURNING GLASS,
224,THE BURNING GLASS,"A shaft of fire that falls like dew,"
225,THE BURNING GLASS,"And melts and maddens all my blood,"
226,THE BURNING GLASS,From out thy spirit flashes through
227,THE BURNING GLASS,The burning glass of womanhood.
228,THE BURNING GLASS,
229,THE BURNING GLASS,Only so far; here must I stay:
230,THE BURNING GLASS,"Nearer I miss the light, the fire:"
231,THE BURNING GLASS,"I must endure the torturing ray,"
232,THE BURNING GLASS,"And, with all beauty, all desire."
233,THE BURNING GLASS,
234,THE BURNING GLASS,"Ah, time-long must the effort be,"
235,THE BURNING GLASS,And far the way that I must go
236,THE BURNING GLASS,"To bring my spirit unto thee,"
237,THE BURNING GLASS,"Behind the glass, within the glow."
238,THE BURNING GLASS,
239,THE BURNING GLASS,

242,A VISION OF BEAUTY,A VISION OF BEAUTY
243,A VISION OF BEAUTY,
244,A VISION OF BEAUTY,
245,A VISION OF BEAUTY,"Where we sat at dawn together, while the star-rich heavens shifted,"
246,A VISION OF BEAUTY,"We were weaving dreams in silence, suddenly the veil was lifted."
247,A VISION OF BEAUTY,"By a hand of fire awakened, in a moment caught and led"
248,A VISION OF BEAUTY,Upward to the wondrous vision: through the star-mists overhead
249,A VISION OF BEAUTY,Flare and flaunt the monstrous highlands; on the sapphire coast of night
250,A VISION OF BEAUTY,Fall the ghostly froth and fringes of the ocean of the light.
251,A VISION OF BEAUTY,Many coloured shine the vapours: to the moon-eye far away
252,A VISION OF BEAUTY,"'Tis the fairy ring of twilight mid the spheres of night and day,"
253,A VISION OF BEAUTY,"Girdling with a rainbow cincture round the planet where we go,"
254,A VISION OF BEAUTY,"We and it together fleeting, poised upon the pearl  glow;"
255,A VISION OF BEAUTY,We and it and all together flashing through the starry spaces
256,A VISION OF BEAUTY,In a tempest dream of beauty lighting up the place of places.
257,A VISION OF BEAUTY,Half our eyes behold the glory: half within the spirit's glow
258,A VISION OF BEAUTY,Echoes of the noiseless revels and the will of beauty go.
259,A VISION OF BEAUTY,"By a hand of fire uplifted--to her star-strewn palace brought,"
260,A VISION OF BEAUTY,To the mystic heart of beauty and the secret of her thought:
261,A VISION OF BEAUTY,"Here of yore the ancient mother in the fire mists sank to rest,"
262,A VISION OF BEAUTY,"And she built her dreams about her, rayed from out her burning breast:"
263,A VISION OF BEAUTY,"Here the wild will woke within her lighting up her flying dreams,"
264,A VISION OF BEAUTY,"Round and round the planets whirling break in woods and flowers and streams,"
265,A VISION OF BEAUTY,"And the winds are shaken from them as the leaves from off the rose,"
266,A VISION OF BEAUTY,"And the feet of earth go dancing in the way that beauty goes,"
267,A VISION OF BEAUTY,And the souls of earth are kindled by the incense of her breath
268,A VISION OF BEAUTY,As her light alternate lures them through the gates of birth and death.
269,A VISION OF BEAUTY,"O'er the fields of space together following her flying traces,"
270,A VISION OF BEAUTY,"In a radiant tumult thronging, suns and stars and myriad races"
271,A VISION OF BEAUTY,"Mount the spirit spires of beauty, reaching onward to the day"
272,A VISION OF BEAUTY,When the Shepherd of the Ages draws his misty hordes away
273,A VISION OF BEAUTY,"Through the glimmering deeps to silence, and within the awful fold"
274,A VISION OF BEAUTY,"Life and joy and love forever vanish as a tale is told,"
275,A VISION OF BEAUTY,"Lost within the mother's being. So the vision flamed and fled,"
276,A VISION OF BEAUTY,And before the glory fallen every other dream lay dead.
277,A VISION OF BEAUTY,
278,A VISION OF BEAUTY,
279,A VISION OF BEAUTY,
280,A VISION OF BEAUTY,
281,REST,REST
282,REST,
283,REST,
284,REST,"On me to rest, my bird, my bird:"
285,REST,The swaying branches of my heart
286,REST,Are blown by every wind toward
287,REST,The home whereto their wings depart.
288,REST,
289,REST,"Build not your nest, my bird, on me:"
290,REST,I know no peace but ever sway:
291,REST,"O, lovely bird, be free, be free,"
292,REST,On the wild music of the day.
293,REST,
294,REST,"But sometimes when your wings would rest,"
295,REST,And winds are laid on quiet eves:
296,REST,"Come, I will bear you breast to breast,"
297,REST,And lap you close with loving leaves.
298,REST,

302,THE EARTH BREATH,THE EARTH BREATH
303,THE EARTH BREATH,
304,THE EARTH BREATH,
305,THE EARTH BREATH,From the cool and dark-lipped furrow breathes a dim delight
306,THE EARTH BREATH,Through the woodland's purple plumage to the diamond night.
307,THE EARTH BREATH,Aureoles of joy encircle every blade of grass
308,THE EARTH BREATH,Where the dew-fed creatures silent and enraptured pass.
309,THE EARTH BREATH,"And the restless ploughman pauses, turns, and wondering,"
310,THE EARTH BREATH,Deep beneath his rustic habit finds himself a king;
311,THE EARTH BREATH,For a fiery moment looking with the eyes of God
312,THE EARTH BREATH,Over fields a slave at morning bowed him to the sod.
313,THE EARTH BREATH,Blind and dense with revelation every moment flies.
314,THE EARTH BREATH,"And unto the mighty mother, gay, eternal, rise"
315,THE EARTH BREATH,"All the hopes we hold, the gladness, dreams of things to be."
316,THE EARTH BREATH,"One of all thy generations, mother, hails to thee."
317,THE EARTH BREATH,"Hail, and hail, and hail for ever, though I turn again"
318,THE EARTH BREATH,From thy joy unto the human vestiture of pain.
319,THE EARTH BREATH,"I, thy child who went forth radiant in the golden prime,"
320,THE EARTH BREATH,Find thee still the mother-hearted through my night in time:
321,THE EARTH BREATH,Find in thee the old enchantment there behind the veil
322,THE EARTH BREATH,"Where the gods, my brothers, linger. Hail, for ever hail!"
323,THE EARTH BREATH,
324,THE EARTH BREATH,

327,DIVINE VISITATION,DIVINE VISITATION
328,DIVINE VISITATION,
329,DIVINE VISITATION,
330,DIVINE VISITATION,The heavens lay hold on us: the starry rays
331,DIVINE VISITATION,Fondle with flickering fingers brow and eyes:
332,DIVINE VISITATION,A new enchantment lights the ancient skies.
333,DIVINE VISITATION,What is it looks between us gaze on gaze?
334,DIVINE VISITATION,Does the wild spirit of the endless days
335,DIVINE VISITATION,Chase through my heart some lure that ever flies?
336,DIVINE VISITATION,Only I know the vast within me cries
337,DIVINE VISITATION,Finding in thee the ending of all ways.
338,DIVINE VISITATION,"Ah, but they vanish; the immortal train"
339,DIVINE VISITATION,"From thee, from me, depart, yet take from thee"
340,DIVINE VISITATION,Memorial grace: laden with adoration
341,DIVINE VISITATION,Forth from this heart they flow that all in vain
342,DIVINE VISITATION,Would stay the proud eternal powers that flee
343,DIVINE VISITATION,After the chase in burning exultation.

348,THE MASTER SINGER,THE MASTER SINGER
349,THE MASTER SINGER,
350,THE MASTER SINGER,
351,THE MASTER SINGER,"A laughter in the diamond air, a music in the trembling grass;"
352,THE MASTER SINGER,And one by one the words of light as joydrops through my being pass.
353,THE MASTER SINGER,"I am the sunlight in the heart, the silver moonglow in the mind;"
354,THE MASTER SINGER,My laughter runs and ripples through the wavy tresses of the wind.
355,THE MASTER SINGER,"I am the fire upon the hills, the dancing flame that leads afar"
356,THE MASTER SINGER,"Each burning-hearted wanderer, and I the dear and homeward star."
357,THE MASTER SINGER,"A myriad lovers died for me, and in their latest yielded breath"
358,THE MASTER SINGER,I woke in glory giving them immortal life though touched by death.
359,THE MASTER SINGER,"They knew me from the dawn of time: if Hermes beats his rainbow wings,"
360,THE MASTER SINGER,"If Angus shakes his locks of light, or golden-haired Apollo sings,"
361,THE MASTER SINGER,"It matters not the name, the land; my joy in all the gods abides:"
362,THE MASTER SINGER,Even in the cricket in the grass some dimness of me smiles and hides.
363,THE MASTER SINGER,"For joy of me the day star glows, and in delight and wild desire"
364,THE MASTER SINGER,"The peacock twilight rays aloft its plumes and blooms of shadowy fire,"
365,THE MASTER SINGER,"Where in the vastness too I burn through summer nights and ages long,"
366,THE MASTER SINGER,And with the fiery footed Watchers shake in myriad dance and song.

371,APHRODITE,APHRODITE
372,APHRODITE,
373,APHRODITE,
374,APHRODITE,Not unremembering we pass our exile from the starry ways:
375,APHRODITE,One timeless hour in time we caught from the long night of endless days.
376,APHRODITE,With solemn gaiety the stars danced far withdrawn on elfin heights:
377,APHRODITE,The lilac breathed amid the shade of green and blue and citron lights.
378,APHRODITE,"But yet the close enfolding night seemed on the phantom verge of things,"
379,APHRODITE,For our adoring hearts had turned within from all their wanderings:
380,APHRODITE,For beauty called to beauty and there thronged at the enchanter's will
381,APHRODITE,The vanished hours of love that burn within the Ever-living still.
382,APHRODITE,"And sweet eternal faces put the shadows of the earth to rout,"
383,APHRODITE,And faint and fragile as a moth your white hand fluttered and went out.
384,APHRODITE,"Oh, who am I who tower beside this goddess of the twilight air?"
385,APHRODITE,The burning doves fly from my heart and melt within her bosom there.
386,APHRODITE,"I know the sacrifice of old they offered to the mighty queen,"
387,APHRODITE,And this adoring love has brought us back the beauty that has been.
388,APHRODITE,As to her worshippers she came descending from her glowing skies
389,APHRODITE,So Aphrodite I have seen with shining eyes look through your eyes:
390,APHRODITE,One gleam of the ancestral face which lighted up the dawn for me:
391,APHRODITE,One fiery visitation of the love the gods desire in thee!
392,APHRODITE,

394,APHRODITE,
395,APHRODITE,
396,ILLUSION,ILLUSION
397,ILLUSION,
398,ILLUSION,
399,ILLUSION,What is the love of shadowy lips
400,ILLUSION,"That know not what they seek or press,"
401,ILLUSION,From whom the lure for ever slips
402,ILLUSION,And fails their phantom tenderness?
403,ILLUSION,
404,ILLUSION,The mystery and light of eyes
405,ILLUSION,That near to mine grow dim and cold;
406,ILLUSION,They move afar in ancient skies
407,ILLUSION,Mid flame and mystic darkness rolled.
408,ILLUSION,
409,ILLUSION,"O, beauty, as thy heart o'erflows"
410,ILLUSION,"In tender yielding unto me,"
411,ILLUSION,A vast desire awakes and grows
412,ILLUSION,Unto forgetfulness of thee.

418,BABYLON,
419,BABYLON,
420,BABYLON,The blue dusk ran between the streets; my love was winged within my mind;
421,BABYLON,It left to-day and yesterday and thrice a thousand years behind.
422,BABYLON,To-day was past and dead for me for from to-day my feet had run
423,BABYLON,Through thrice a thousand years to walk the ways of ancient Babylon.
424,BABYLON,On temple top and palace roof the burnished gold flung back the rays
425,BABYLON,Of a red sunset that was dead and lost beyond a million days.
426,BABYLON,The tower of heaven turns darker blue; a starry sparkle now begins;
427,BABYLON,"The mystery and magnificence, the myriad beauty and the sins"
428,BABYLON,Come back to me. I walk beneath the shadowy multitude of towers;
429,BABYLON,Within the gloom the fountain jets its pallid mist in lily flowers.
430,BABYLON,"The waters lull me, and the scent of many gardens, and I hear"
431,BABYLON,"Familiar voices, and the voice I love is whispering in my ear."
432,BABYLON,Oh real as in dream all this; and then a hand on mine is laid:
433,BABYLON,"The wave of phantom time withdraws; and that young Babylonian maid,"
434,BABYLON,"One drop of beauty left behind from all the flowing of that tide,"
435,BABYLON,"Is looking with the self-same eyes, and here in Ireland by my side."
436,BABYLON,"Oh, light our life in Babylon, but Babylon has taken wings,"
437,BABYLON,While we are in the calm and proud procession of eternal things.

446,ALTER EGO,"Breathes within my heart a rhyme,"

448,ALTER EGO,In and out the courts of Time.
