161,THE INTRUDER,The colouring of spacious flowers rove delicious to the eye.
162,THE INTRUDER,"The road above the harbour fickle, carousing in its tendency"
163,THE INTRUDER,to pull too gray by sky enamelled water.
164,THE INTRUDER,"The tropical foliage, still and languorous, to my touch."
165,THE INTRUDER,Each particle of sunlight dangling as if hoisted from
166,THE INTRUDER,a perfumed ledge.

172,THE INTRUDER,
173,THE INTRUDER,Life in such climes is built on connotations rather than pure
174,THE INTRUDER,innuendoes of purpose.
175,THE INTRUDER,"The southern sky, the heat above the sea allude to this."
176,THE INTRUDER,"This triumphant trilogy embossed upon volcanic slate, more"

195,DINNER AT EIGHT,
196,DINNER AT EIGHT,"At times, I thought of swizzling white rum"
197,DINNER AT EIGHT,"in the tropics (not as a vocation),"
198,DINNER AT EIGHT,dropping into the club
199,DINNER AT EIGHT,for a round of tennis
200,DINNER AT EIGHT,before dinner at eight
201,DINNER AT EIGHT,or a quiet set of darts
202,DINNER AT EIGHT,before retiring.
203,DINNER AT EIGHT,
204,DINNER AT EIGHT,I had grown accustomed to my new routine
205,DINNER AT EIGHT,(at least vicariously).
206,DINNER AT EIGHT,In the best Somerset Maugham tradition
207,DINNER AT EIGHT,"I would dress for dinner,"
208,DINNER AT EIGHT,"decline to be patronizing,"
209,DINNER AT EIGHT,avoid the potential slur
210,DINNER AT EIGHT,if crisp linen did not appear
211,DINNER AT EIGHT,regularly on my bed or table.
212,DINNER AT EIGHT,I still found time to stop
213,DINNER AT EIGHT,"for breakfast coffee,"
214,DINNER AT EIGHT,take a moment from regimen
215,DINNER AT EIGHT,"to fondle fresh, wet flowers,"
216,DINNER AT EIGHT,look over the balcony at the
217,DINNER AT EIGHT,blueness of the bay.
218,DINNER AT EIGHT,
219,DINNER AT EIGHT,The metaphysical qualities that come
220,DINNER AT EIGHT,into play erode such morning somnambulations.
221,DINNER AT EIGHT,The heat depreciated any vainglorious
222,DINNER AT EIGHT,attempts to lionize the native Caribbean rum.
223,DINNER AT EIGHT,"Tennis and darts become ho-hum,"
224,DINNER AT EIGHT,more of a task than a pleasant diversion.
225,DINNER AT EIGHT,The little yellowed board seemed
226,DINNER AT EIGHT,to symbolize not convivial cordiality
227,DINNER AT EIGHT,but crabbed provincialism.
228,DINNER AT EIGHT,
229,DINNER AT EIGHT,The tie & collar were intolerable
230,DINNER AT EIGHT,against the saline tropic night and
231,DINNER AT EIGHT,seemed rigid in a place and time
232,DINNER AT EIGHT,the locals could not possibly share.
233,DINNER AT EIGHT,"In short, such things celebrated my apartness."
234,DINNER AT EIGHT,
235,DINNER AT EIGHT,"Linen rarely, if ever, appeared"
236,DINNER AT EIGHT,and to resort to complaints
237,DINNER AT EIGHT,resulted in only furthering
238,DINNER AT EIGHT,the distance between one and his hosts.
239,DINNER AT EIGHT,Even the coffee tasted bitter and seemed
240,DINNER AT EIGHT,unsuited to the needs of an interloper.
241,DINNER AT EIGHT,Neither was fruit juice the promised manna.
242,DINNER AT EIGHT,And one can take only so much nostalgic flower warbling.
243,DINNER AT EIGHT,The hummingbirds and oleander came to grow
244,DINNER AT EIGHT,as commonplace and exhausting as the rain.
245,DINNER AT EIGHT,
246,DINNER AT EIGHT,I began ruminating thoughts back to my previous existence.
247,DINNER AT EIGHT,"Surprised at my illogical shift in allegiances,"
248,DINNER AT EIGHT,I began stealing thoughts more and more surreptitiously
249,DINNER AT EIGHT,"about the naturalness of working a full day,"
250,DINNER AT EIGHT,"donning the apparel of a civilized man,"
251,DINNER AT EIGHT,dropping the white man's burden.
252,DINNER AT EIGHT,Disgust filled me with my former Rousseauian yearnings.
253,DINNER AT EIGHT,"With trepidation, one's dreams"
254,DINNER AT EIGHT,can erect barriers more effective
255,DINNER AT EIGHT,than the most ill-sponsored illusions.

266,THE BAY OF CORTES,
267,THE BAY OF CORTES,The guano rocks are isles and stepping stones
268,THE BAY OF CORTES,of bird waste.
269,THE BAY OF CORTES,"They lie thick and bedeviled with fish fur,"
270,THE BAY OF CORTES,a dull lavender cached hard to the sun
271,THE BAY OF CORTES,seems to shine a metallic harvest white
272,THE BAY OF CORTES,as desert rocklets scattered to the breeze.
273,THE BAY OF CORTES,
274,THE BAY OF CORTES,A speck of a fisherman dots the horizon.
275,THE BAY OF CORTES,His craft a barque in loneliness across the sea.
276,THE BAY OF CORTES,"Dolphins inveigh the richness of the depths,"
277,THE BAY OF CORTES,persuade latitudes to drift about their wake.
278,THE BAY OF CORTES,"Pelicans sour the parabola distances between light and sound,"
279,THE BAY OF CORTES,become chancy over this distant breath of song.
280,THE BAY OF CORTES,
281,THE BAY OF CORTES,Above the cliffs and the inner roads that follow
282,THE BAY OF CORTES,"the desert into geometric squares, stand abodes."
283,THE BAY OF CORTES,The thin supremacy of shadows at dusk disparage the
284,THE BAY OF CORTES,traveller here.
285,THE BAY OF CORTES,Burros strayed lie dead by the highway's edge.
286,THE BAY OF CORTES,The liquid depth of the mountains reinforces vulnerability.
287,THE BAY OF CORTES,"The night air is alive with the torment of insects, asplash"
288,THE BAY OF CORTES,with sound.
289,THE BAY OF CORTES,Lights carry an eerie message dotted about the hills.
