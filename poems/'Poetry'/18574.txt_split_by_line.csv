26,ACROSS THE SEA,"Now just as the gates were opened to let in the men, I looked in"

28,ACROSS THE SEA,and behold the City shone like the sun; the streets also were paved
29,ACROSS THE SEA,"with gold,"
30,ACROSS THE SEA,"and in them walked many men, with crowns on their heads,"
31,ACROSS THE SEA,"palms in their hands, and golden harps to sing praises withal."

64,PREFACE.,"The poem whose name gives title to this little volume, was published"
65,PREFACE.,"in outline in the winter of 1869, and now appears for the first time"
66,PREFACE.,"as completed. _The sea,_ as a picture of life, has been celebrated by"
67,PREFACE.,"the poetic thought of all ages, and the author will therefore hardly"
68,PREFACE.,hope to offer much that is new in the following verses. His only
69,PREFACE.,"excuse for so worn a theme is, that the world still loves the"
70,PREFACE.,"picture, and that each generation can, at best, but reset the old"
71,PREFACE.,jewels of the past.

106,I.--CHILDHOOD.,I.--CHILDHOOD.
107,I.--CHILDHOOD.,
108,I.--CHILDHOOD.,
109,I.--CHILDHOOD.,Ah! who can speak that country whence I fled?
110,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"None but a lover may its beauty know,"
111,I.--CHILDHOOD.,None but a poet can its rapture sing;
112,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"And e'en his muse, upborne on Fancy's wing,"
113,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"Will grieve o'er beauties still unnoticed,"
114,I.--CHILDHOOD.,O'er raptures language is too poor to show.
115,I.--CHILDHOOD.,
116,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"Fore'er remains the land where children dwell,"
117,I.--CHILDHOOD.,Earth's fairest mem'ry and its Palestine;
118,I.--CHILDHOOD.,Tho' years have passed since on my forehead there
119,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"Were graven lines of weariness and care,"
120,I.--CHILDHOOD.,Still on the silver string of memory oft I tell
121,I.--CHILDHOOD.,The golden beads of joy that once were mine.
122,I.--CHILDHOOD.,
123,I.--CHILDHOOD.,Dear distant Land of Childhood! God doth know
124,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"That I have longed to dwell in thee again,"
125,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"As when by care unvexed, by doubt undriven,"
126,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"With eyes as blue, and heart as pure, as Heaven."
127,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"Sweet are the days of childhood, glad the flow"
128,I.--CHILDHOOD.,Of unhurt joyous life in every vein.
129,I.--CHILDHOOD.,
130,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"It may not be, those sunny hours are flown,"
131,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"And loud ""The Fortune"" knocks at every gate;"
132,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"Still move we on the path where none returns,"
133,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"Where wait afar, or near, our funeral urns,"
134,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"That mystic path, whose ways are all unknown,"
135,I.--CHILDHOOD.,For only life's surprises make us great.
136,I.--CHILDHOOD.,
137,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"Yet still I dream, as o'er the swelling deep,"
138,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"I gaze upon the far enchanted shore,"
139,I.--CHILDHOOD.,Through whose retreats the memory-brooding sea
140,I.--CHILDHOOD.,Rolls in deep monotone continually.
141,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"Waves of soft melody, which fall asleep"
142,I.--CHILDHOOD.,In rosy glens that I may see no more.
143,I.--CHILDHOOD.,
144,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"O holy music of the flowing sea,"
145,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"Heard never but at eve, when shifts and gleams"
146,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"On waves afar the light of joy still ours,"
147,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"Because remembered still, thy voice o'erpowers"
148,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"My soul with pensiveness, sweet reverie"
149,I.--CHILDHOOD.,And memory of half-forgotten dreams.
150,I.--CHILDHOOD.,
151,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"Twas early, Sea of Life, I loved thee well,"
152,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"And mused betimes upon thy strand, till rolled"
153,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"Ashore from Daylight's wreck her gilded spars,"
154,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"And Night, in thee, a chandelier of stars"
155,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"Had hung, to light the grots where mermen dwell,"
156,I.--CHILDHOOD.,The deep-sea grots of amethyst and gold.
157,I.--CHILDHOOD.,
158,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"Beyond thee, when thou wert of gentle mood,"
159,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"And held with all the weary winds a truce,"
160,I.--CHILDHOOD.,Upon the other shore I could descry
161,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"Where, faintly outlined in the western sky,"
162,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"A mystic rainbow-girdled Headland stood,"
163,I.--CHILDHOOD.,Whose silver sandals thou dost rise to loose.
164,I.--CHILDHOOD.,
165,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"Far on the verge, where sky and waters meet,"
166,I.--CHILDHOOD.,The Headland's hazy outline I could trace;
167,I.--CHILDHOOD.,High in the blue of Heaven its summit lay;
168,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"There sleeps the twilight, till the crystal Day,"
169,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"Waked by the song of birds from slumber sweet,"
170,I.--CHILDHOOD.,Beams on the Headland fair with lovelit face.
171,I.--CHILDHOOD.,
172,I.--CHILDHOOD.,For I have ne'er believed the Headland's brow
173,I.--CHILDHOOD.,Is bathed forever in the noon-day glare;
174,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"Dearer to me the quiet hour of eve,"
175,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"And when at last this passion world I leave,"
176,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"May I, sometimes, behold the stars, as now,--"
177,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"In the sweet gloaming--tho' ""no night is there."""
178,I.--CHILDHOOD.,
179,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"One early morn, ere earth had waked from sleep,"
180,I.--CHILDHOOD.,From the calm shadow of my tent I stole;
181,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"I could not rest, and as I sought the shore,"
182,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"To tell my longings to the ocean o'er,"
183,I.--CHILDHOOD.,"A warning Voice, uprising from the deep,"
184,I.--CHILDHOOD.,Murmured in plaintive rhythm to my soul.
185,I.--CHILDHOOD.,
186,I.--CHILDHOOD.,
187,I.--CHILDHOOD.,
188,THE VOICE.,THE VOICE.
189,THE VOICE.,
190,THE VOICE.,
191,THE VOICE.,Why wouldst thou go? the way is long and drear;
192,THE VOICE.,"Thou mayst be happy where thou art, but stern"
193,THE VOICE.,The fortune is that rules the watery waste.
194,THE VOICE.,He who doth wisdom love will not make haste
195,THE VOICE.,"To change a peaceful way for one of fear,"
196,THE VOICE.,And he who leaves this shore can ne'er return.
197,THE VOICE.,
198,THE VOICE.,The warrior waves that lie in peace asleep
199,THE VOICE.,"Upon the stilly bosom of the main,"
200,THE VOICE.,"Will don their plumes of snow when night is by,"
201,THE VOICE.,And rise in battle 'gainst the stormy sky;
202,THE VOICE.,"Where wilt thou hide thee from the angry deep,"
203,THE VOICE.,Till it has sunk to silvery dreams again?
204,THE VOICE.,
205,THE VOICE.,
206,THE VOICE.,
207,THE ANSWER.,THE ANSWER.
208,THE ANSWER.,
209,THE ANSWER.,
210,THE ANSWER.,"I may escape, for others have before,"
211,THE ANSWER.,Why should I fear to view the storm-cloud's form?
212,THE ANSWER.,"I answered to the Voice. In One I trust,"
213,THE ANSWER.,"Upon whose blazing path the clouds are dust,"
214,THE ANSWER.,Why should I cower 'neath the whirlwind's roar?
215,THE ANSWER.,God's chariot is the whirlwind and the storm.
216,THE ANSWER.,
217,THE ANSWER.,"The thunder of the deep will be my psalm,"
218,THE ANSWER.,"And e'en the crested wave, that totters o'er"
219,THE ANSWER.,"My way, will seem an emerald arbor fair,"
220,THE ANSWER.,With portals of bluebells and lilies rare;
221,THE ANSWER.,"For Fancy knoweth not of storm or calm,"
222,THE ANSWER.,It dreameth but of beauty evermore.
223,THE ANSWER.,
224,THE ANSWER.,
225,THE ANSWER.,
226,THE VOICE.,THE VOICE.
227,THE VOICE.,
228,THE VOICE.,
229,THE VOICE.,"Yet 'tis a weary way, the Voice replied,"
230,THE VOICE.,A trackless way of danger and of care;
231,THE VOICE.,"And from thy cheek, ere tho the Headland find,"
232,THE VOICE.,The rose will yield its petals to the wind;
233,THE VOICE.,And from thy heart an adverse cruel tide
234,THE VOICE.,"Will steal the dream of hope, and leave--despair."
235,THE VOICE.,
236,THE VOICE.,"Consider too, O youth, Earth is a sphere,"
237,THE VOICE.,"And he who journeys to the verge of age,"
238,THE VOICE.,"But comes at eve to where he left at morn,"
239,THE VOICE.,"But views at last the hearth where he was born,"
240,THE VOICE.,"But learns, the bright horizon ne'er draws near"
241,THE VOICE.,The circle climbers of life's pilgrimage.
242,THE VOICE.,
243,THE VOICE.,"Think well, again, thou mayst forever part"
244,THE VOICE.,"From pleasure, seeking pleasure o'er the main."
245,THE VOICE.,The good of life--such is the human lot--
246,THE VOICE.,Seems only good to those who have it not.
247,THE VOICE.,"Joy, smiling, opes the portals of the heart."
248,THE VOICE.,"But when he enters, Lo! his name is Pain."
249,THE VOICE.,
250,THE VOICE.,Nothing but rest can satisfy thy thirst
251,THE VOICE.,For happiness. Hast thou on land or sea
252,THE VOICE.,"Found what was not a weariness at last,"
253,THE VOICE.,And shall to-morrow cheat thee as the past?
254,THE VOICE.,"The glowing bubbles of the future burst,"
255,THE VOICE.,Touched by the finger-tip of Memory.
256,THE VOICE.,
257,THE VOICE.,"Thou art a poet, yet perchance may find"
258,THE VOICE.,The birds will carol more delicious lays;
259,THE VOICE.,"Thy waves of song may melt in melody,"
260,THE VOICE.,Yet softer is the music of the sea.
261,THE VOICE.,"Thou canst not rhyme so sweetly as the wind,"
262,THE VOICE.,And nature is too subtile for thy phrase.
263,THE VOICE.,
264,THE VOICE.,"But leaning on the muffled harp of thought,"
265,THE VOICE.,"Here sweet for thee will sigh the summer wind,"
266,THE VOICE.,And dreamful will the rhythm of the deep
267,THE VOICE.,Upon the shore of silver fall asleep.
268,THE VOICE.,"Nor wilt thou miss what thou has never sought,"
269,THE VOICE.,Nor seek what men at last have failed to find.
270,THE VOICE.,
271,THE VOICE.,"Yet if thou wilt not heed our counsel sage,"
272,THE VOICE.,"If still thou dost our warning cry despise,"
273,THE VOICE.,Yon barge will bear thee from these happy shores.
274,THE VOICE.,"Behold its silken sail, its crew, the oars,"
275,THE VOICE.,"And thou its prow, thro' calm and tempest rage,"
276,THE VOICE.,Mayst guide in peace at last--if thou art wise.
277,THE VOICE.,
278,THE VOICE.,"Thus speaks the Voice to every child, but yet"
279,THE VOICE.,Youth evermore to Hope will loyal be.
280,THE VOICE.,"Impatiently I listened to the strain,"
281,THE VOICE.,"Then turned me to the Headland once again,"
282,THE VOICE.,Which in the early morning light was set
283,THE VOICE.,An emerald in a golden ring of sea.
284,THE VOICE.,
285,THE VOICE.,
286,THE VOICE.,
287,II.--YOUTH.,II.--YOUTH.
288,II.--YOUTH.,
289,II.--YOUTH.,
290,II.--YOUTH.,"The slow long wave crept up the ocean marge,"
291,II.--YOUTH.,To steal the silver sparkle of the sand;
292,II.--YOUTH.,"Then lapsing from the shore, I scarce could feel"
293,II.--YOUTH.,"Its soft pulsations underneath the keel,"
294,II.--YOUTH.,"As I sat patiently within the barge,"
295,II.--YOUTH.,Until the breeze should bear me from the land.
296,II.--YOUTH.,
297,II.--YOUTH.,"And as I waited, lo! the morning sun"
298,II.--YOUTH.,"Rose golden on the misty eastern sky,"
299,II.--YOUTH.,And through the rosy dells the sunbeams bright
300,II.--YOUTH.,Stole from the flowers the jewels of the night;
301,II.--YOUTH.,But yet no seaward zephyr had begun
302,II.--YOUTH.,To fill the canvas drooping listlessly.
303,II.--YOUTH.,
304,II.--YOUTH.,"I saw an aged man upon the shore,"
305,II.--YOUTH.,There was a kindly smile upon his face
306,II.--YOUTH.,"As thus he spake to me--""Here have I dwelt"
307,II.--YOUTH.,"For centuries, yet I have never felt"
308,II.--YOUTH.,"The winds of heaven upon my forehead, nor"
309,II.--YOUTH.,Will they e'er visit this spell-haunted place.
310,II.--YOUTH.,
311,II.--YOUTH.,Your gaily-painted barge will wait in vain
312,II.--YOUTH.,For favoring winds to fill its silken sail.
313,II.--YOUTH.,If you would ever leave these drowsy shores
314,II.--YOUTH.,Your crew must sweep the waters from their oars.
315,II.--YOUTH.,"To win the Blessed Headland o'er the main,"
316,II.--YOUTH.,"But tireless strength and effort will avail."""
317,II.--YOUTH.,
318,II.--YOUTH.,I gazed adown the barge; the silent men
319,II.--YOUTH.,"Toyed with their oars, awaiting my command;"
320,II.--YOUTH.,"The first was ""Courage""--quick to see and dare,"
321,II.--YOUTH.,"And next came ""Patience,"" he as ready e'er"
322,II.--YOUTH.,"To calm an angry brow to peace, and then"
323,II.--YOUTH.,"Came ""Justice""--""Knowledge"" sat at his right hand."
324,II.--YOUTH.,
325,II.--YOUTH.,I held the rudder. No hand but mine own
326,II.--YOUTH.,Could guide the mystic barge across the sea.
327,II.--YOUTH.,"But in the bow stood ""Faith,"" whose vision keen"
328,II.--YOUTH.,"Discerns what mortal eye hath never seen,"
329,II.--YOUTH.,"And when a mist across the deep is blown,"
330,II.--YOUTH.,Sendeth sweet messages of hope to me.
331,II.--YOUTH.,
332,II.--YOUTH.,"Why tarry ye, O men? the way is long"
333,II.--YOUTH.,To yonder hazy Headland's wave-worn base.
334,II.--YOUTH.,"We wait in vain for favoring winds to blow,"
335,II.--YOUTH.,"'Tis yours to pull the oars. Row, bravely, row,"
336,II.--YOUTH.,"Keep even stroke, ye merry hearts, with song,"
337,II.--YOUTH.,And lead the swift sea-birds a winning race.
338,II.--YOUTH.,
339,II.--YOUTH.,"The willing oarsmen heard the words, and bent"
340,II.--YOUTH.,"Them to the toil; but ""Knowledge"" had not heard,"
341,II.--YOUTH.,"And still he dreamed upon his trailing oar,"
342,II.--YOUTH.,Until the barge had rounded to the shore
343,II.--YOUTH.,We scarce had left. In vain the labor spent.
344,II.--YOUTH.,The old man smiled again. The swift sea-bird
345,II.--YOUTH.,
346,II.--YOUTH.,"Such rivalry would never fear, said he,"
347,II.--YOUTH.,"""Knowledge"" must pull with ""Courage""; ""Justice,"" too,"
348,II.--YOUTH.,"Must draw his stroke with ""Patience,"" else your barge,"
349,II.--YOUTH.,"Despite your strength, will never leave the marge,"
350,II.--YOUTH.,But still in weary revolutions be
351,II.--YOUTH.,A vanity of vanities to you.
352,II.--YOUTH.,
353,II.--YOUTH.,These words to you in parting. O beware
354,II.--YOUTH.,"In seeking heaven, lest you despise the earth;"
355,II.--YOUTH.,"Heaven is both what we are and where we go,"
356,II.--YOUTH.,And we are heaven-builders here below;
357,II.--YOUTH.,"Alike we take it and we find it there,"
358,II.--YOUTH.,And heaven is worth to us what we are worth.
359,II.--YOUTH.,
360,II.--YOUTH.,"God hath the earth to heaven in marriage given,"
361,II.--YOUTH.,See how the ocean yieldeth tenderly
362,II.--YOUTH.,The penciled shadow of the morning bars
363,II.--YOUTH.,"Whereon, like notes of music, rest the stars."
364,II.--YOUTH.,"Ah! listen, for the azure dome of heaven"
365,II.--YOUTH.,Is echoing now the music of the sea.
366,II.--YOUTH.,
367,II.--YOUTH.,"Love wisely then the earth, and you shall love"
368,II.--YOUTH.,The Holy City where the angels dwell.
369,II.--YOUTH.,The gentle light of love will never bring
370,II.--YOUTH.,The circling moth upon his dusty wing.
371,II.--YOUTH.,"No thief will steal, no rust corrode above,"
372,II.--YOUTH.,Nor in your heart--if love be there. Farewell.
373,II.--YOUTH.,
374,II.--YOUTH.,
375,II.--YOUTH.,
376,III.--MANHOOD.,III.--MANHOOD.
377,III.--MANHOOD.,
378,III.--MANHOOD.,
379,III.--MANHOOD.,"So to their oars my boatmen, cheerily,"
380,III.--MANHOOD.,"Bent once again, and then, with steady stroke,"
381,III.--MANHOOD.,They drew upon the waters till the shore
382,III.--MANHOOD.,"Grew lower in the distance, and no more"
383,III.--MANHOOD.,"Thro' the gray mist the mentor I could see,"
384,III.--MANHOOD.,But oft I thought upon the words he spoke.
385,III.--MANHOOD.,
386,III.--MANHOOD.,"And oft, O wise Experience, have I found"
387,III.--MANHOOD.,The lesson true you taught to me that day.
388,III.--MANHOOD.,"_No progress but by toil, and there must be"
389,III.--MANHOOD.,In heart and mind a vital unity._
390,III.--MANHOOD.,"Our days are else in vain, and ne'er will bound"
391,III.--MANHOOD.,"The ""Barge of Time"" upon the heavenly way."
392,III.--MANHOOD.,
393,III.--MANHOOD.,"But soon the ripple of an adverse tide,--"
394,III.--MANHOOD.,Whose darkling bitter waters seemed to stay
395,III.--MANHOOD.,"The prow,--twined like a sea-weed growth the oars;"
396,III.--MANHOOD.,A tide that hies forever from the shores
397,III.--MANHOOD.,"I sought, and with its soft caresses, wide"
398,III.--MANHOOD.,"And far, bears hapless wanderers away."
399,III.--MANHOOD.,
400,III.--MANHOOD.,Yet gallant are the boats that drift along;
401,III.--MANHOOD.,Proud are the hearts that float where flows the tide.
402,III.--MANHOOD.,The youth whose heated fancy sees afar
403,III.--MANHOOD.,"The promise of ambition's streaming star,"
404,III.--MANHOOD.,And he who follows with a careless song
405,III.--MANHOOD.,Some godless passion he has deified.
406,III.--MANHOOD.,
407,III.--MANHOOD.,"The man of curling lip and brow of scorn,"
408,III.--MANHOOD.,"The worshiper of reason and of self,"
409,III.--MANHOOD.,"The atheist, wanton, and the giddy maid,"
410,III.--MANHOOD.,The faith-betrayer and the love-betrayed;
411,III.--MANHOOD.,"Self-righteous pharisees, who would adorn"
412,III.--MANHOOD.,Or hide with pious garb their love of pelf.
413,III.--MANHOOD.,
414,III.--MANHOOD.,"The poet with a poem on his lip,"
415,III.--MANHOOD.,"The writer with an essay in his heart,"
416,III.--MANHOOD.,"The statesman with a law within his brain,"
417,III.--MANHOOD.,The merchant princes busy with their gain;
418,III.--MANHOOD.,Dreamers who reck not that their barges slip
419,III.--MANHOOD.,Upon a tide from which so few may part.
420,III.--MANHOOD.,
421,III.--MANHOOD.,"Ah, tide that hurries to the Land of Fear,"
422,III.--MANHOOD.,"The arms are feeble, and perplexed the will,"
423,III.--MANHOOD.,"And the hearts childish that must stem thy flow,"
424,III.--MANHOOD.,"And it is sweet to rest, and hard to row."
425,III.--MANHOOD.,"I, too, have drifted on thy waters drear,"
426,III.--MANHOOD.,And but for grace divine were drifting still.
427,III.--MANHOOD.,
428,III.--MANHOOD.,*     *     *     *     *     *
429,III.--MANHOOD.,
430,III.--MANHOOD.,"Life's sea, at best, is but a lonely sea,"
431,III.--MANHOOD.,Yet thrice from angry winds and waters rude
432,III.--MANHOOD.,The mem'ry of their bitter feud has flown
433,III.--MANHOOD.,On the soft pinions of a gentle tone.
434,III.--MANHOOD.,Thrice heavenly messengers have come to me
435,III.--MANHOOD.,To break the bondage of my solitude.
436,III.--MANHOOD.,
437,III.--MANHOOD.,"And first, my mother's love, warm, tender, true,"
438,III.--MANHOOD.,"To guide me o'er the billowy deep, was given;"
439,III.--MANHOOD.,"E'en now I view her barge's silvery trail,"
440,III.--MANHOOD.,"And faint, in distance, mark her snowy sail"
441,III.--MANHOOD.,Bloom like a lily on the water blue.
442,III.--MANHOOD.,"'Tis but a mirage, she is long in heaven."
443,III.--MANHOOD.,
444,III.--MANHOOD.,"O how my heart has hungered for her smile,"
445,III.--MANHOOD.,"When life has pressed me with a weight of cares,"
446,III.--MANHOOD.,"Yet I have thought, wherever I have been,"
447,III.--MANHOOD.,Some gentle power was leading me from sin
448,III.--MANHOOD.,"To virtue's sweeter, nobler way the while."
449,III.--MANHOOD.,"It was the power, dear mother, of thy prayers."

691,THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.,"Built by the cruel Decius, strong and high,"

698,THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.,"And Malchus, cautiously descends the mount,"
699,THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.,To buy their bread in pagan Ephesus.
700,THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.,Yet much he fears the tyrant Decius
701,THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.,And the rough buffets of the Roman Guard.
702,THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.,"When, lo! descending to the city's gate,"
703,THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.,He sees a golden cross thereon upreared;
704,THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.,"And passing through the portals in a daze,"
705,THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.,He wanders on in wonder through the ways.
706,THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.,Where are the images of all the gods--
707,THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.,The silver semblance of Diana fair?
708,THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.,"He sees them not, but everywhere he views"
709,THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.,"The sacred symbol of the Savior's death,"
710,THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.,And hears the name of Christ on every tongue.
711,THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.,"At last he enters in where bread is sold,"
712,THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.,And gives in payment there a silver coin.

715,THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.,"""Nay you but jest,"" said Malchus, ""where is he?"""
716,THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.,"""Dead these two hundred years,"" the man replied,"
717,THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.,"And, deeming that the youth had lost his mind,"
718,THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.,He sent him to the Bishop of the town.
719,THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.,"The Bishop heard the marvelous story through,"
720,THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.,"And being deeply learned in history,"

723,THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.,"Then coming to the rocky mountain cave,"
724,THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.,"(Led up by Malchus all the winding way,)"

726,THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.,"Nor lacked he faith in God, for he believed"

846,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,To bleak Siberia. A churlish crowd
847,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,Received his message with a stupid stare;
848,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"Which, as he gently told them of their need"
849,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"Of Him who came to save them from their sins,"
850,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"Changed to a glare of rage. So curst were they,"
851,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,They would have slain him; but on his calm face
852,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"There fell a light supernal, and he passed"
853,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"In safety through their midst, and came at last"
854,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,To where the Arctic laves with icy wave
855,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"The chill Siberian coast, and there a boat"
856,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"Filled with strong men received him, and they plied"
857,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"Their oars, and like a swift-winged bird, sped north."
858,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,
859,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,Within the iceberg barricade which girds
860,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"Impregnably the Northern Pole, 'tis said"
861,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"There is a Beulah Land surpassing fair,"
862,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"With beaming sky and soft delicious air,"
863,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,Rich with the perfume sweet of blossoms rare.
864,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,Its trees have never turned to russet tinge;
865,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"The girdling waves, warm as the summer, fringe"
866,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"Its golden sands with lace of foam, and die"
867,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,In soft accord with bird-song melody.
868,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"No cruel heats nor chilling blasts invade,"
869,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,But the sweet quietude of twilight shade
870,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,Brings ever to the mind a holy calm.
871,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"And there, 'tis said, the Great Apostle waits"
872,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"Until the end of all things shall draw near,"
873,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"When he will come again, and preach to men"
874,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"With the old words of love, and move their hearts"
875,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"To penitence, and they will captive yield"
876,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"To the sweet words of truth, and give their lives"
877,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,With heartiness to deeds of charity.
878,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,
879,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"Come, blest Apostle! from the icy North"
880,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"Haste thy departure, for the world is faint"
881,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,And weary for the music of thy feet.
882,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,The earth is growing old. Two thousand years
883,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,Have fled since thou and Jesus walked with men.
884,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,Two thousand years of bitterness of creeds;
885,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,Two thousand years of selfishness and crime.
886,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,
887,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,Come thou! our clouded hearts to gently win
888,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"From chilling unbelief, from fear and sin."
889,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"Come, as to evening comes the silver moon;"
890,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,As comes the south-wind on the wings of June:
891,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"From the far south the waves of summer roll,"
892,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"Come from the North, thou summer of the soul!"
893,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"O, how our eyes are lifted to behold"
894,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,The rising of the star whose beams of gold
895,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"Will usher in, with Bethlehem songs above,"
896,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,The day of Love--sweet universal Love.
897,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"Thou art its priest, O son of Zebedee,"
898,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,And we are waiting--waiting still for thee.
899,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,Why tarry yet thy footsteps from afar
900,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,Thou gentler John the Baptist? May thy star
901,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,"The herald of _The Christ_ uprising shine,"
902,A LEGEND OF ST. JOHN.,The harbinger of love--of Love Divine.
