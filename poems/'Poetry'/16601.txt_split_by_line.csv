82,INTRODUCTION,INTRODUCTION
83,INTRODUCTION,
84,INTRODUCTION,
85,INTRODUCTION,The extreme rarity of _The Death-Wake_ is a reason for its
86,INTRODUCTION,"republication, which may or may not be approved of by collectors. Of"
87,INTRODUCTION,the original edition the Author says that more than seventy copies
88,INTRODUCTION,"were sold in the first week of publication, but thereafter the"
89,INTRODUCTION,publisher failed in business. Mr. Stoddart recovered the sheets of his
90,INTRODUCTION,"poem, and his cook gradually, and perhaps not injudiciously, expended"
91,INTRODUCTION,them for domestic purposes.
92,INTRODUCTION,
93,INTRODUCTION,"Apart from its rarity, _The Death-Wake_ has an interest of its own for"
94,INTRODUCTION,curious amateurs of poetry. The year of its composition (1830) was the
95,INTRODUCTION,"great year of _Romanticisme_ in France, the year of _Hernani_, and of"
96,INTRODUCTION,Gautier's _gilet rouge_. In France it was a literary age given to
97,INTRODUCTION,"mediæval extravagance, to the dagger and the bowl, the cloak and"
98,INTRODUCTION,"sword, the mad monk and the were-wolf; the age of Pétrus Borel and"
99,INTRODUCTION,"MacKeat, as well as of Dumas and Hugo. Now the official poetry of our"
100,INTRODUCTION,country was untouched by and ignorant of the virtues and excesses of
101,INTRODUCTION,1830. Wordsworth's bolt was practically shot; Sir Walter was ending
102,INTRODUCTION,"his glorious career; Shelley and Byron and Keats were dead, and the"
103,INTRODUCTION,_annus mirabilis_ of Coleridge was long gone by. Three young poets of
104,INTRODUCTION,"the English-speaking race were producing their volumes, destined at"
105,INTRODUCTION,first to temporary neglect. The year 1830 was the year of Mr.
106,INTRODUCTION,"Tennyson's _Poems, chiefly Lyrical_, his first book, not counting"
107,INTRODUCTION,_Poems by Two Brothers_. It was also the year of Mr. Browning's
108,INTRODUCTION,_Pauline_ (rarer even than _The Death-Wake_); and it was the year
109,INTRODUCTION,"which followed the second, and perhaps the most characteristic,"
110,INTRODUCTION,"poetical venture of Edgar Allan Poe. In Mr. Tennyson's early lyrics,"
111,INTRODUCTION,"and in Mr. Poe's, any capable judge must have recognised new notes of"
112,INTRODUCTION,"romance. Their accents are fresh and strange, their imaginations dwell"
113,INTRODUCTION,"in untrodden regions. Untouched by the French romantic poets, they yet"
114,INTRODUCTION,"unconsciously reply to their notes, as if some influence in the mental"
115,INTRODUCTION,"air were at work on both sides of the Channel, on both sides of the"
116,INTRODUCTION,"Atlantic. Now, in my opinion, this indefinite influence was also"
117,INTRODUCTION,"making itself felt, faintly and dimly, in Scotland. _The Death-Wake_"
118,INTRODUCTION,"is the work of a lad who certainly had read Keats, Coleridge and"
119,INTRODUCTION,"Shelley, but who is no imitator of these great poets. He has, in a few"
120,INTRODUCTION,"passages, and at his best, an accent original, distinct, strangely"
121,INTRODUCTION,"musical, and really replete with promise. He has a fresh unborrowed"
122,INTRODUCTION,"melody and mastery of words, the first indispensable sign of a true"
123,INTRODUCTION,poet. His rhymed heroic verse is no more the rhymed heroic verse of
124,INTRODUCTION,"_Endymion_, than it is that of Mr. Pope, or of Mr. William Morris. He"
125,INTRODUCTION,is a new master of the old instrument.
126,INTRODUCTION,
127,INTRODUCTION,"His mood is that of Scott when Scott was young, and was so anxious to"
128,INTRODUCTION,"possess a death's head and cross-bones. The malady is ""most incident"""
129,INTRODUCTION,"to youth, but Mr. Stoddart wears his rue with a difference. The mad"
130,INTRODUCTION,monkish lover of the dead nun Agathé has hit on precisely the sort of
131,INTRODUCTION,fantasy which was about to inspire Théophile Gautier's _Comédie de la
132,INTRODUCTION,"Mort_, or the later author of _Gaspard de la Nuit_, or Edgar Poe."
133,INTRODUCTION,"There is here no ""criticism of life;"" it is a criticism of strange"
134,INTRODUCTION,"death; and, so far, may recall Beddoes's _Death's Jest-Book_,"
135,INTRODUCTION,"unpublished, of course, in 1830. Naturally this kind of poetry is"
136,INTRODUCTION,"""useless,"" as Mr. Ruskin says about Coleridge, but, in its _bizarre_"
137,INTRODUCTION,"way, it may be beautiful."
138,INTRODUCTION,
139,INTRODUCTION,"The author, by a curious analogy with Théophile Gautier, was, in these"
140,INTRODUCTION,"days, a humourist as well as a poet. In the midst of his mad fancies"
141,INTRODUCTION,"and rare melodies he is laughing at himself, as Théophile mocked at"
142,INTRODUCTION,"_Les Jeunes France_. The psychological position is, therefore, one of"
143,INTRODUCTION,"the rarest. Mr. Stoddart was, first of all and before all, a hardy and"
144,INTRODUCTION,enthusiastic angler. Between 1830 and 1840 he wrote a few beautiful
145,INTRODUCTION,"angling songs, and then all the poetry of his character merged itself"
146,INTRODUCTION,"in an ardent love of Nature: of hill, loch and stream--above all, of"
147,INTRODUCTION,"Tweed, the fairest of waters, which he lived to see a sink of"
148,INTRODUCTION,pollution. After 1831 we have no more romanticism from Mr. Stoddart.
149,INTRODUCTION,"The wind, blowing where it listeth, struck on him as on an Æolian"
150,INTRODUCTION,"harp, and ""an uncertain warbling made,"" in the true Romantic manner."
151,INTRODUCTION,"He did write a piece with the alluring name of _Ajalon of the Winds_,"
152,INTRODUCTION,"but not one line of it survives. The rest is not silence, indeed, for,"
153,INTRODUCTION,"in addition to his lays of trout and salmon, of Tweed and Teviot, Mr."
154,INTRODUCTION,"Stoddart wrote a good deal of prose, and a good deal of perfectly"
155,INTRODUCTION,"common and uninspired verse. The Muse, which was undeniably with him"
156,INTRODUCTION,"for an hour, abandoned him, or he deserted her, being content to whip"
157,INTRODUCTION,"the waters of Tweed, and Meggat, and Yarrow. Perhaps unfavourable and"
158,INTRODUCTION,"unappreciative criticism, acting on a healthy and contented nature,"
159,INTRODUCTION,"drove him back into the common paths of men. Whatever the cause, the"
160,INTRODUCTION,_Death-Wake_ alone (save for a few angling songs) remains to give
161,INTRODUCTION,"assurance of a poet ""who died young."" It is needless to rewrite the"
162,INTRODUCTION,"biography, excellently done, in _Angling Songs_, by Miss Stoddart, the"
163,INTRODUCTION,"poet's daughter (Blackwoods, Edinburgh, 1889). Mr. Stoddart was born"
164,INTRODUCTION,"on St. Valentine's Day 1810, in Argyll Square, Edinburgh, nearly on"
165,INTRODUCTION,"the site of the Kirk of Field, where Darnley was murdered. He came of"
166,INTRODUCTION,an old Border family. Miss Stoddart tells a painful tale of an aged
167,INTRODUCTION,Miss Helen who burned family papers because she thought she was
168,INTRODUCTION,bewitched by the seals and decorated initials. Similar follies are
169,INTRODUCTION,"reported of a living old lady, on whose hearth, after a night of"
170,INTRODUCTION,"destruction, was once found the impression of a seal of Mary of"
171,INTRODUCTION,Modena. I could give only too good a guess at the _provenance_ of
172,INTRODUCTION,"_those_ papers, but nobody can interfere. Beyond 1500 the family"
173,INTRODUCTION,memories rely on tradition. The ancestors owned lands in the Forest of
174,INTRODUCTION,"Ettrick, and Williamhope, on the Tweed hard by Ashestiel. On the"
175,INTRODUCTION,"Glenkinnon burn, celebrated by Scott, they hid the prophets of the"
176,INTRODUCTION,"Covenant ""by fifties in a cave."" One Williamhope is said to have been"
177,INTRODUCTION,"out at Drumclog, or, perhaps, Bothwell Brig. This laird, of enormous"
178,INTRODUCTION,"strength, was called the Beetle of Yarrow, and was a friend of Murray"
179,INTRODUCTION,"of Philiphaugh. His son, in the Fifteen, was out on the Hanoverian"
180,INTRODUCTION,"side, which was _not_ in favour with the author of _The Death-Wake_."
181,INTRODUCTION,"He married a daughter of Veitch of The Glen, now the property of Sir"
182,INTRODUCTION,"Charles Tennant. In the next generation but one, the Stoddarts sold"
183,INTRODUCTION,"their lands and took to commerce, while the poet's father won great"
184,INTRODUCTION,distinction in the Navy. The great-great-grandfather of the poet
185,INTRODUCTION,"married a Miss Muir of Anniston, the family called cousins (on which"
186,INTRODUCTION,"side of the blanket I know not) with Robert II. of Scotland, and, by"
187,INTRODUCTION,"another line, were as near as in the sixth degree of James III."
188,INTRODUCTION,
189,INTRODUCTION,"As a schoolboy, Mr. Stoddart was always rhyming of goblin, ghost,"
190,INTRODUCTION,"fairy, and all Sir Walter's themes. At Edinburgh University he was a"
191,INTRODUCTION,"pupil of Christopher North (John Wilson), who pooh-poohed _The"
192,INTRODUCTION,"Death-Wake_ in _Blackwood_. He also knew Aytoun, Professor Ferrier, De"
193,INTRODUCTION,"Quincey, Hartley Coleridge, and Hogg, and was one of the first guests"
194,INTRODUCTION,"of Tibbie Sheils, on the spit of land between St. Mary's and the Loch"
195,INTRODUCTION,of the Lowes. In verses of this period (1827) Miss Stoddart detects
196,INTRODUCTION,"traces of Keats and Byron, but the lines quoted are much better in"
197,INTRODUCTION,_technique_ than Byron usually wrote.
198,INTRODUCTION,
199,INTRODUCTION,"The summer of 1830 Mr. Stoddart passed in Hogg's company on Yarrow,"
200,INTRODUCTION,and early in 1831 he published _The Death-Wake_. There is no trace of
201,INTRODUCTION,"James Hogg in the poem, which, to my mind, is perfectly original."
202,INTRODUCTION,"Wilson places it ""between the weakest of Shelley and the strongest of"
203,INTRODUCTION,"Barry Cornwall."" It is really nothing but a breath of the spirit of"
204,INTRODUCTION,"romance, touching an instrument not wholly out of tune, but never to"
205,INTRODUCTION,be touched again.
206,INTRODUCTION,
207,INTRODUCTION,It is unnecessary to follow Mr. Stoddart through a long and happy life
208,INTRODUCTION,of angling and of literary leisure. He only blossomed once. His poem
209,INTRODUCTION,"was plagiarised and inserted in _Graham's Magazine_, by a person named"
210,INTRODUCTION,"Louis Fitzgerald Tasistro (vol. xx.). Mr. Ingram, the biographer of"
211,INTRODUCTION,"Edgar Poe, observes that Poe praised the piece while he was exposing"
212,INTRODUCTION,"Tasistro's ""barefaced robbery."""
213,INTRODUCTION,
214,INTRODUCTION,The copy of _The Death-Wake_ from which this edition is printed was
215,INTRODUCTION,"once the property of Mr. Aytoun, author of _Lays of the Scottish"
216,INTRODUCTION,"Cavaliers_, and, I presume, of _Ta Phairshon_. Mr. Aytoun has written"
217,INTRODUCTION,"a prefatory sonnet which will be found in its proper place, a set of"
218,INTRODUCTION,"rhymes on the flyleaf at the end, and various cheerful but unfeeling"
219,INTRODUCTION,notes. After some hesitation I do not print these frivolities.
220,INTRODUCTION,
221,INTRODUCTION,The copy was most generously presented to me by Professor Knight of
222,INTRODUCTION,"St. Andrews, and I have only seen one other example, which I in turn"
223,INTRODUCTION,contributed to fill the vacant place in the shelves of Mr. Knight. His
224,INTRODUCTION,"example, however, is far the more curious of the twain, by virtue of"
225,INTRODUCTION,Aytoun's annotations.
226,INTRODUCTION,
227,INTRODUCTION,"I had been wanting to see _The Death-Wake_ ever since, as a boy, I"
228,INTRODUCTION,read the unkind review of it in an ancient volume of _Blackwood's
229,INTRODUCTION,"Magazine_. In its ""pure purple mantle"" of glazed cloth, with paper"
230,INTRODUCTION,"label, it is an unaffectedly neat and well-printed little volume."
231,INTRODUCTION,
232,INTRODUCTION,It would be unbecoming and impertinent to point out to any one who has
233,INTRODUCTION,"an ear for verse, the charm of such lines as--"
234,INTRODUCTION,
235,INTRODUCTION,"""A murmur far and far, of those that stirred"
236,INTRODUCTION,"Within the great encampment of the sea."""
237,INTRODUCTION,
238,INTRODUCTION,Or--
239,INTRODUCTION,
240,INTRODUCTION,"""A love-winged seraph glides in glory by,"
241,INTRODUCTION,"Striking the tent of its mortality."""
242,INTRODUCTION,
243,INTRODUCTION,(An idea anticipated by the as yet unknown Omar Khayyam).
244,INTRODUCTION,
245,INTRODUCTION,Or--
246,INTRODUCTION,
247,INTRODUCTION,"""Dost thou, in thy vigil, hail"
248,INTRODUCTION,"Arcturus in his chariot pale,"
249,INTRODUCTION,Leading him with a fiery flight
250,INTRODUCTION,"Over the hollow hill of night?"""
251,INTRODUCTION,
252,INTRODUCTION,"These are wonderful verses for a lad of twenty-one, living among"
253,INTRODUCTION,"anglers, undergraduates, and, if with some society of the lettered,"
254,INTRODUCTION,apparently with none which could appreciate or applaud him.
255,INTRODUCTION,
256,INTRODUCTION,"For the matter of the poem, the wild voyage of the mad monkish lover"
257,INTRODUCTION,"with the dead Bride of Heaven, it strikes, of course, on the common"
258,INTRODUCTION,reef of the Romantic--the ridiculous. But the recurring contrasts of a
259,INTRODUCTION,"pure, clear peace in sea and sky, are of rare and atoning beauty. Such"
260,INTRODUCTION,a passage is--
261,INTRODUCTION,
262,INTRODUCTION,"""And the great ocean, like a holy hall,"
263,INTRODUCTION,"Where slept a seraph host maritimal,"
264,INTRODUCTION,"Was gorgeous with wings of diamond."""
265,INTRODUCTION,
266,INTRODUCTION,"Once more, when the mad monk tells the sea-waves"
267,INTRODUCTION,
268,INTRODUCTION,"""That ye have power and passion, and a sound"
269,INTRODUCTION,"As of the flying of an angel round,"
270,INTRODUCTION,"The mighty world, that ye are one with Time,"""
271,INTRODUCTION,
272,INTRODUCTION,we recognise genuine imagination.
273,INTRODUCTION,
274,INTRODUCTION,A sympathetic reader of _The Death-Wake_ would perhaps have expected
275,INTRODUCTION,"the leprosies and lunacies to drop off, and the genius, purged of its"
276,INTRODUCTION,"accidents, to move into a pure transparency. The abnormal, the"
277,INTRODUCTION,"monstrous, the boyish elements should have been burned away in the"
278,INTRODUCTION,"fire of the genius of poetry. But the Muses did not so will it, and"
279,INTRODUCTION,the mystic wind of the spirit of song became of less moment to Mr.
280,INTRODUCTION,Stoddart than the breeze on the loch that stirs the trout to feed.
281,INTRODUCTION,Perhaps his life was none the less happy and fortunate. Of the many
282,INTRODUCTION,"brilliant men whom he knew intimately--Wilson, Aytoun, Ferrier,"
283,INTRODUCTION,"Glassford Bell, and others--perhaps none, not even Hogg, recognised"
284,INTRODUCTION,the grace of the Muse which (in my poor opinion) Mr. Stoddart
285,INTRODUCTION,possessed. His character was not in the least degree soured by neglect
286,INTRODUCTION,or fretted by banter. Not to over-estimate oneself is a virtue very
287,INTRODUCTION,"rare among poets, and certainly does not lead to public triumphs."
288,INTRODUCTION,Modesty is apt to accompany the sense of humour which alleviates
289,INTRODUCTION,"life, while it is an almost insuperable bar to success."
290,INTRODUCTION,
291,INTRODUCTION,"Mr. Stoddart died on November 22nd, 1880. His last walk was to Kelso"
292,INTRODUCTION,"Bridge ""to look at the Tweed,"" which now murmurs by his grave the"
293,INTRODUCTION,self-same song that it sings beside Sir Walter's tomb in Dryburgh
294,INTRODUCTION,"Abbey. We leave his poem to the judgment of students of poetry, and to"
295,INTRODUCTION,him we say his own farewell--
296,INTRODUCTION,
297,INTRODUCTION,"Sorrow, sorrow speed away"
298,INTRODUCTION,"To our angler's quiet mound,"
299,INTRODUCTION,"With the old pilgrim, twilight grey,"
300,INTRODUCTION,Enter thou the holy ground.
301,INTRODUCTION,
302,INTRODUCTION,"There he sleeps, whose heart was twined"
303,INTRODUCTION,"With wild stream and wandering burn,"

417,CHIMERA I,"To that fair one, and to her sister Peace,"
418,CHIMERA I,That lieth in her grave. When wilt thou cease
419,CHIMERA I,To feed upon my quiet!--thou Despair!
420,CHIMERA I,"That art the mad usurper, and the heir,"
421,CHIMERA I,"Of this heart's heritage! Go, go--return,"
422,CHIMERA I,"And bring me back oblivion, and an urn!"
423,CHIMERA I,"And ye, pale stars, may look, and only find,"
424,CHIMERA I,"The wreck of a proud tree, that lets the wind"
425,CHIMERA I,Count o'er its blighted boughs; for such was he
426,CHIMERA I,"That loved, and loves, the silent Agathè!"""
427,CHIMERA I,"And he hath left the sanctuary, like one"
428,CHIMERA I,That knew not his own purpose--The red sun
429,CHIMERA I,"Rose early over incense of bright mist,"
430,CHIMERA I,That girdled a pure sky of amethyst.
431,CHIMERA I,And who was he? A monk. And those who knew
432,CHIMERA I,Yclept him Julio; but they were few:
433,CHIMERA I,"And others named him as a nameless one,--"
434,CHIMERA I,"A dark, sad-hearted being, who had none"
435,CHIMERA I,"But bitter feelings, and a cast of sadness,"
436,CHIMERA I,That fed the wildest of all curses--madness!
437,CHIMERA I,
438,CHIMERA I,"But he was, what _none_ knew, of lordly line,"
439,CHIMERA I,"That fought in the far land of Palestine,"
440,CHIMERA I,"Where, under banners of the cross, they fell,"
441,CHIMERA I,Smote by the armies of the infidel.
442,CHIMERA I,"And Julio was the last; alone, alone!"
443,CHIMERA I,"A sad, unfriended orphan, that had gone"
444,CHIMERA I,"Into the world, to murmur and to die,"
445,CHIMERA I,Like the cold breezes that are passing by!
446,CHIMERA I,
447,CHIMERA I,And few they were that bade him to their board;
448,CHIMERA I,"His fortunes now were over, and the sword"
449,CHIMERA I,Of his proud ancestry dishonour'd--left
450,CHIMERA I,To moulder in its sheath--a hated gift!
451,CHIMERA I,
452,CHIMERA I,Ay! it was so; and Julio had fain
453,CHIMERA I,Have been a warrior; but his very brain
454,CHIMERA I,"Grew fever'd at the sickly thought of death,"
455,CHIMERA I,And to be stricken with a want of breath!--
456,CHIMERA I,"To be the food of worms--inanimate,"
457,CHIMERA I,"And cold as winter,--and as desolate!"
458,CHIMERA I,"And then to waste away, and be no more"
459,CHIMERA I,Than the dark dust!--The thought was like a sore
460,CHIMERA I,"That gather'd in his heart; and he would say,--"
461,CHIMERA I,"""A curse be on their laurels!"" and decay"
462,CHIMERA I,Came over them; the deeds that they had done
463,CHIMERA I,Had fallen with their fortunes; and anon
464,CHIMERA I,"Was Julio forgotten, and his line--"
465,CHIMERA I,No wonder for this frenzied tale of mine!
466,CHIMERA I,
467,CHIMERA I,Oh! he was wearied of this passing scene!
468,CHIMERA I,But loved not death: his purpose was between
469,CHIMERA I,"Life and the grave; and it would vibrate there,"
470,CHIMERA I,Like a wild bird that floated far and fair
471,CHIMERA I,Betwixt the sun and sea!
472,CHIMERA I,
473,CHIMERA I,"He went, and came,"
474,CHIMERA I,"And thought, and slept, and still awoke the same,--"
475,CHIMERA I,"A strange, strange youth; and he would look all night"
476,CHIMERA I,"Upon the moon and stars, and count the flight"
477,CHIMERA I,"Of the sea waves, and let the evening wind"
478,CHIMERA I,"Play with his raven tresses, or would bind"
479,CHIMERA I,"Grottoes of birch, wherein to sit and sing:"
480,CHIMERA I,"And peasant girls would find him sauntering,"
481,CHIMERA I,"To gaze upon their features, as they met,"
482,CHIMERA I,"In laughter, under some green arboret."
483,CHIMERA I,
484,CHIMERA I,"At last, he became monk, and, on his knees,"
485,CHIMERA I,"Said holy prayers, and with wild penances"
486,CHIMERA I,"Made sad atonement; and the solemn whim,"
487,CHIMERA I,"That, like a shadow, loiter'd over him,"
488,CHIMERA I,"Wore off, even like a shadow. He was cursed"
489,CHIMERA I,With none of the mad thoughts that were at first
490,CHIMERA I,The poison of his quiet; but he grew
491,CHIMERA I,"To love the world and its wild laughter too,"
492,CHIMERA I,As he had known before; and wish'd again
493,CHIMERA I,To join the very mirth he hated then!
494,CHIMERA I,
495,CHIMERA I,He durst not break the vow--he durst not be
496,CHIMERA I,The one he would--and his heart's harmony
497,CHIMERA I,"Became a tide of sorrow. Even so,"
498,CHIMERA I,"He felt hope die,--in madness and in woe!"
499,CHIMERA I,But there came one--and a most lovely one
500,CHIMERA I,As ever to the warm light of the sun
501,CHIMERA I,"Threw back her tresses,--a fair sister girl,"
502,CHIMERA I,"With a brow changing between snow and pearl,"
503,CHIMERA I,"And the blue eyes of sadness, fill'd with dew"
504,CHIMERA I,"Of tears,--like Heaven's own melancholy blue,--"
505,CHIMERA I,"So beautiful, so tender; and her form"
506,CHIMERA I,"Was graceful as a rainbow in a storm,"
507,CHIMERA I,Scattering gladness on the face of sorrow--
508,CHIMERA I,Oh! I had fancied of the hues that borrow
509,CHIMERA I,Their brightness from the sun; but she was bright
510,CHIMERA I,"In her own self,--a mystery of light!"
511,CHIMERA I,"With feelings tender as a star's own hue,"
512,CHIMERA I,"Pure as the morning star! as true, as true;"
513,CHIMERA I,"For it will glitter in each early sky,"
514,CHIMERA I,And her first love be love that lasteth aye!
515,CHIMERA I,
516,CHIMERA I,"And this was Agathè, young Agathè,"
517,CHIMERA I,"A motherless, fair girl: and many a day"
518,CHIMERA I,She wept for her lost parent. It was sad
519,CHIMERA I,To see her infant sorrow; how she bade
520,CHIMERA I,The flow of her wild spirits fall away
521,CHIMERA I,"To grief, like bright clouds in a summer day"
522,CHIMERA I,Melting into a shower: and it was sad
523,CHIMERA I,"Almost to think she might again be glad,"
524,CHIMERA I,"Her beauty was so chaste, amid the fall"
525,CHIMERA I,"Of her bright tears. Yet, in her father's hall,"
526,CHIMERA I,She had lived almost sorrowless her days:
527,CHIMERA I,But he felt no affection for the gaze
528,CHIMERA I,"Of his fair girl; and when she fondly smiled,"
529,CHIMERA I,"He bade no father's welcome to the child,"
530,CHIMERA I,"But even told his wish, and will'd it done,"
531,CHIMERA I,For her to be sad-hearted--and a nun!
532,CHIMERA I,
533,CHIMERA I,"And so it was. She took the dreary veil,"
534,CHIMERA I,A hopeless girl! and the bright flush grew pale
535,CHIMERA I,"Upon her cheek: she felt, as summer feels"
536,CHIMERA I,"The winds of autumn and the winter chills,"
537,CHIMERA I,"That darken his fair suns.--It was away,"
538,CHIMERA I,"Feeding on dreams, the heart of Agathè!"
539,CHIMERA I,
540,CHIMERA I,"The vesper prayers were said, and the last hymn"
541,CHIMERA I,"Sung to the Holy Virgin. In the dim,"
542,CHIMERA I,"Gray aisle was heard a solitary tread,"
543,CHIMERA I,As of one musing sadly on the dead--
544,CHIMERA I,'Twas Julio; it was his wont to be
545,CHIMERA I,Often alone within the sanctuary;
546,CHIMERA I,"But now, not so--another: it was she!"
547,CHIMERA I,"Kneeling in all her beauty, like a saint"
548,CHIMERA I,Before a crucifix; but sad and faint
549,CHIMERA I,"The tone of her devotion, as the trill"
550,CHIMERA I,"Of a moss-burden'd, melancholy rill."
551,CHIMERA I,
552,CHIMERA I,And Julio stood before her;--'twas as yet
553,CHIMERA I,The hour of the pale twilight--and they met
554,CHIMERA I,"Each other's gaze, till either seem'd the hue"
555,CHIMERA I,Of deepest crimson; but the ladye threw
556,CHIMERA I,"Her veil above her features, and stole by"
557,CHIMERA I,"Like a bright cloud, with sadness and a sigh!"
558,CHIMERA I,
559,CHIMERA I,"Yet Julio still stood gazing and alone,"
560,CHIMERA I,"A dreamer!--""Is the sister ladye gone?"""
561,CHIMERA I,He started at the silence of the air
562,CHIMERA I,That slumber'd over him--she is not there.
563,CHIMERA I,
564,CHIMERA I,"And either slept not through the live-long night,"
565,CHIMERA I,"Or slept in fitful trances, with a bright,"
566,CHIMERA I,Fair dream upon their eyelids: but they rose
567,CHIMERA I,In sorrow from the pallet of repose;
568,CHIMERA I,For the dark thought of their sad destiny
569,CHIMERA I,"Came o'er them, like a chasm of the deep sea,"
570,CHIMERA I,That was to rend their fortunes; and at eve
571,CHIMERA I,"They met again, but, silent, took their leave,"
572,CHIMERA I,"As they did yesterday: another night,"
573,CHIMERA I,And neither spake awhile--A pure delight
574,CHIMERA I,Had chasten'd love's first blushes: silently
575,CHIMERA I,Gazed Julio on the gentle Agathè--
576,CHIMERA I,"At length, ""Fair Nun!""--She started, and held fast"
577,CHIMERA I,"Her bright hand on her lip--""the past, the past,"
578,CHIMERA I,And the pale future! There be some that lie
579,CHIMERA I,"Under those marble urns--I know not why,"
580,CHIMERA I,"But I were better in that only calm,"
581,CHIMERA I,"Than be as I have been, perhaps, and am."
582,CHIMERA I,"The past!--ay! it hath perish'd; never, never,"
583,CHIMERA I,Would I recall it to be blest for ever:
584,CHIMERA I,"The future it must come--I have a vow""--"
585,CHIMERA I,And his cold hand rose trembling to his brow.
586,CHIMERA I,"""True, true, I have a vow. Is not the moon"
587,CHIMERA I,"Abroad, fair Nun?""--""Indeed! so very soon?"""
588,CHIMERA I,"Said Agathè, and ""I must then away.""--"
589,CHIMERA I,"""Stay, love! 'tis early yet; stay, angel, stay!"""
590,CHIMERA I,But she was gone:--yet they met many a time
591,CHIMERA I,"In the lone chapel, after vesper chime--"
592,CHIMERA I,They met in love and fear.
593,CHIMERA I,
594,CHIMERA I,"One weary day,"
595,CHIMERA I,And Julio saw not his loved Agathè;
596,CHIMERA I,She was not in the choir of sisterhood
597,CHIMERA I,"That sang the evening anthem, and he stood"
598,CHIMERA I,Like one that listen'd breathlessly awhile;
599,CHIMERA I,But stranger voices chanted through the aisle.
600,CHIMERA I,"She was not there; and, after all were gone,"
601,CHIMERA I,"He linger'd: the stars came--he linger'd on,"
602,CHIMERA I,Like a dark fun'ral image on the tomb
603,CHIMERA I,Of a lost hope. He felt a world of gloom
604,CHIMERA I,Upon his heart--a solitude--a chill.
605,CHIMERA I,"The pale morn rose, and still, he linger'd still."
606,CHIMERA I,"And the next vesper toll'd; nor yet, nor yet--"
607,CHIMERA I,"""Can Agathè be faithless, and forget?"""
608,CHIMERA I,
609,CHIMERA I,"It was the third sad eve, he heard it said,"
610,CHIMERA I,"""Poor Julio! thy Agathè is dead,"""
611,CHIMERA I,And started. He had loiter'd in the train
612,CHIMERA I,That bore her to the grave: he saw her lain
613,CHIMERA I,"In the cold earth, and heard a requiem"
614,CHIMERA I,Sung over her--To him it was a dream!
615,CHIMERA I,A marble stone stood by the sepulchre;
616,CHIMERA I,"He look'd, and saw, and started--she was there!"
617,CHIMERA I,And Agathè had died; she that was bright--
618,CHIMERA I,She that was in her beauty! a cold blight
619,CHIMERA I,Fell over the young blossom of her brow.
620,CHIMERA I,"And the life-blood grew chill--She is not, now."
621,CHIMERA I,
622,CHIMERA I,"She died, like zephyr falling amid flowers!"
623,CHIMERA I,Like to a star within the twilight hours
624,CHIMERA I,Of morning--and she was not! Some have thought
625,CHIMERA I,"The Lady Abbess gave her a mad draught,"
626,CHIMERA I,"That stole into her heart, and sadly rent"
627,CHIMERA I,"The fine chords of that holy instrument,"
628,CHIMERA I,"Until its music falter'd fast away,"
629,CHIMERA I,"And she--she died,--the lovely Agathè!"
630,CHIMERA I,
631,CHIMERA I,"Again, and through the arras of the gloom"
632,CHIMERA I,Are the pale breezes moaning: by her tomb
633,CHIMERA I,"Bends Julio, like a phantom, and his eye"
634,CHIMERA I,"Is fallen, as the moon-borne tides, that lie"
635,CHIMERA I,"At ebb within the sea. Oh! he is wan,"
636,CHIMERA I,"As winter skies are wan, like ages gone,"
637,CHIMERA I,"And stars unseen for paleness; it is cast,"
638,CHIMERA I,"As foliage in the raving of the blast,"
639,CHIMERA I,"All his fair bloom of thoughts! Is the moon chill,"
640,CHIMERA I,That in the dark clouds she is mantled still?
641,CHIMERA I,And over its proud arch hath Heaven flung
642,CHIMERA I,A scarf of darkness? Agathè was young!
643,CHIMERA I,"And there should be the virgin silver there,"
644,CHIMERA I,The snow-white fringes delicately fair!
645,CHIMERA I,
646,CHIMERA I,"He wields a heavy mattock in his hands,"
647,CHIMERA I,And over him a lonely lanthorn stands
648,CHIMERA I,"On a near niche, shedding a sickly fall"
649,CHIMERA I,"Of light upon a marble pedestal,"
650,CHIMERA I,"Whereon is chisel'd rudely, the essay"
651,CHIMERA I,"Of untaught tool, ""Hic jacet Agathè!"""
652,CHIMERA I,"And Julio hath bent him down in speed,"
653,CHIMERA I,Like one that doeth an unholy deed.
654,CHIMERA I,
655,CHIMERA I,There is a flagstone lieth heavily
656,CHIMERA I,Over the ladye's grave; I wist of three
657,CHIMERA I,"That bore it, of a blessed verity!"
658,CHIMERA I,"But he hath lifted it in his pure madness,"
659,CHIMERA I,"As it were lightsome as a summer gladness,"
660,CHIMERA I,"And from the carved niche hath ta'en the lamp,"
661,CHIMERA I,And hung it by the marble flagstone damp.
662,CHIMERA I,
663,CHIMERA I,"And he is flinging the dark, chilly mould"
664,CHIMERA I,"Over the gorgeous pavement: 'tis a cold,"
665,CHIMERA I,"Sad grave, and there is many a relic there"
666,CHIMERA I,"Of chalky bones, which, in the wasting air,"
667,CHIMERA I,Fell smouldering away; and he would dash
668,CHIMERA I,"His mattock through them, with a cursed clash,"
669,CHIMERA I,That made the lone aisle echo. But anon
670,CHIMERA I,"He fell upon a skull,--a haggard one,"
671,CHIMERA I,"With its teeth set, and the great orbless eye"
672,CHIMERA I,"Revolving darkness, like eternity--"
673,CHIMERA I,"And in his hand he held it, till it grew"
674,CHIMERA I,To have the fleshy features and the hue
675,CHIMERA I,"Of life. He gazed, and gazed, and it became"
676,CHIMERA I,"Like to his Agathè--all, all the same!"
677,CHIMERA I,"He drew it nearer,--the cold, bony thing!--"
678,CHIMERA I,"To kiss the worm-wet lips. ""Ay! let me cling--"
679,CHIMERA I,"Cling to thee now, for ever!"" but a breath"
680,CHIMERA I,Of rank corruption from its jaws of death
681,CHIMERA I,"Went to his nostrils, and he madly laugh'd,"
682,CHIMERA I,"And dash'd it over on the altar shaft,"
683,CHIMERA I,"Which the new risen moon, in her gray light,"
684,CHIMERA I,"Had fondly flooded, beautifully bright!"
685,CHIMERA I,
686,CHIMERA I,Again he went
687,CHIMERA I,"To his wild work, beside the monument."
688,CHIMERA I,"""Ha! leave, thou moon! where thy footfall hath been"
689,CHIMERA I,In sorrow amid heaven! there is sin
690,CHIMERA I,"Under thy shadow, lying like a dew;"
691,CHIMERA I,"So come thou, from thy awful arch of blue,"
692,CHIMERA I,Where thou art even as a silver throne
693,CHIMERA I,"For some pale spectre-king; come thou alone,"
694,CHIMERA I,Or bring a solitary orphan star
695,CHIMERA I,"Under thy wings! afar, afar, afar,"
696,CHIMERA I,"To gaze upon this girl of radiancy,"
697,CHIMERA I,"In her deep slumbers--Wake thee, Agathè!"""
698,CHIMERA I,
699,CHIMERA I,And Julio hath stolen the dark chest
700,CHIMERA I,"Where the fair nun lay coffin'd, in the rest"
701,CHIMERA I,"That wakes not up at morning: she is there,"
702,CHIMERA I,An image of cold calm! One tress of hair
703,CHIMERA I,Lingereth lonely on her snowy brow;
704,CHIMERA I,But the bright eyes are closed in darkness now;
705,CHIMERA I,And their long lashes delicately rest
706,CHIMERA I,"On the pale cheek, like sun-rays in the west,"
707,CHIMERA I,"That fall upon a colourless, sad cloud."
708,CHIMERA I,"Humility lies rudely on the proud,"
709,CHIMERA I,"But she was never proud; and there she is,"
710,CHIMERA I,A yet unwither'd flower the autumn breeze
711,CHIMERA I,"Hath blown from its green stem! 'T is pale, 't is pale,"
712,CHIMERA I,"But still unfaded, like the twilight veil"
713,CHIMERA I,That falleth after sunset; like a stream
714,CHIMERA I,That bears the burden of a silver gleam
715,CHIMERA I,"Upon its waters; and is even so,--"
716,CHIMERA I,"Chill, melancholy, lustreless, and low!"
717,CHIMERA I,
718,CHIMERA I,Beauty in death! a tenderness upon
719,CHIMERA I,"The rude and silent relics, where alone"
720,CHIMERA I,Sat the destroyer! Beauty on the dead!
721,CHIMERA I,The look of being where the breath is fled!
722,CHIMERA I,The unwarming sun still joyous in its light!
723,CHIMERA I,A time--a time without a day or night!
724,CHIMERA I,"Death cradled upon Beauty, like a bee"
725,CHIMERA I,"Upon a flower, that looketh lovingly!--"
726,CHIMERA I,"Like a wild serpent, coiling in its madness,"
727,CHIMERA I,Under a wreath of blossom and of gladness!
728,CHIMERA I,
729,CHIMERA I,And there she is; and Julio bends o'er
730,CHIMERA I,"The sleeping girl,--a willow on the shore"
731,CHIMERA I,Of a Dead Sea! that steepeth its far bough
732,CHIMERA I,"Into the bitter waters,--even now"
733,CHIMERA I,Taking a foretaste of the awful trance
734,CHIMERA I,That was to pass on his own countenance!
735,CHIMERA I,
736,CHIMERA I,Yes! yes! and he is holding his pale lips
737,CHIMERA I,Over her brow; the shade of an eclipse
738,CHIMERA I,"Is passing to his heart, and to his eye,"
739,CHIMERA I,"That is not tearful; but the light will die,"
740,CHIMERA I,"Leaving it like a moon within a mist,--"
741,CHIMERA I,The vision of a spell-bound visionist!
742,CHIMERA I,
743,CHIMERA I,"He breathed a cold kiss on her ashy cheek,"
744,CHIMERA I,"That left no trace--no flush--no crimson streak,"
745,CHIMERA I,"But was as bloodless as a marble stone,"
746,CHIMERA I,Susceptible of silent waste alone.
747,CHIMERA I,And on her brow a crucifix he laid--
748,CHIMERA I,"A jewel'd crucifix, the virgin maid"
749,CHIMERA I,Had given him before she died. The moon
750,CHIMERA I,"Shed light upon her visage--clouded soon,"
751,CHIMERA I,"Then briefly breaking from its airy veil,"
752,CHIMERA I,Like warrior lifting up his aventayle.
753,CHIMERA I,
754,CHIMERA I,"But Julio gazed on, and never lifted"
755,CHIMERA I,"Himself to see the broken clouds, that drifted"
756,CHIMERA I,"One after one, like infant elves at play"
757,CHIMERA I,"Amid the night-winds, in their lonely way--"
758,CHIMERA I,"Some whistling and some moaning, some asleep,"
759,CHIMERA I,"And dreaming dismal dreams, and sighing deep"
760,CHIMERA I,"Over their couches of green moss and flowers,"
761,CHIMERA I,"And solitary fern, and heather bowers."
762,CHIMERA I,
763,CHIMERA I,"The heavy bell toll'd two, and, as it toll'd,"
764,CHIMERA I,"Julio started, and the fresh-turn'd mould"
765,CHIMERA I,"He flung into the empty chasm with speed,"
766,CHIMERA I,And o'er it dropt the flagstone. One could read
767,CHIMERA I,That Agathè lay there; but still the girl
768,CHIMERA I,"Lay by him, like a precious and pale pearl,"
769,CHIMERA I,That from the deep sea-waters had been rent--
770,CHIMERA I,Like a star fallen from the firmament!
771,CHIMERA I,"He hides the grave-tools in an aged porch,"
772,CHIMERA I,To westward of the solitary church;
773,CHIMERA I,And he hath clasp'd around the melting waist
774,CHIMERA I,"The beautiful, dead girl: his cheek is press'd"
775,CHIMERA I,To hers--Life warming the cold chill of Death!
776,CHIMERA I,And over his pale palsy breathing breath
777,CHIMERA I,"His eye is sunk upon her--""Thou must leave"
778,CHIMERA I,"The worm to waste for love of thee, and grieve"
779,CHIMERA I,"Without thee, as I may not. Thou must go,"
780,CHIMERA I,"My sweet betrothed, with me--but not below,"
781,CHIMERA I,"Where there is darkness, dream, and solitude,"
782,CHIMERA I,"But where is light, and life, and one to brood"
783,CHIMERA I,Above thee till thou wakest--Ha! I fear
784,CHIMERA I,"Thou wilt not wake for ever, sleeping here,"
785,CHIMERA I,"Where there are none but winds to visit thee,"
786,CHIMERA I,"And convent fathers, and a choristry"
787,CHIMERA I,"Of sisters, saying, 'Hush!'--But I will sing"
788,CHIMERA I,"Rare songs to thy pure spirit, wandering"
789,CHIMERA I,Down on the dews to hear me; I will tune
790,CHIMERA I,"The instrument of the ethereal moon,"
791,CHIMERA I,"And all the choir of stars, to rise and fall"
792,CHIMERA I,"In harmony and beauty musical."""
793,CHIMERA I,
794,CHIMERA I,He is away--and still the sickly lamp
795,CHIMERA I,"Is burning next the altar; there's a damp,"
796,CHIMERA I,"Thin mould upon the pavement; and, at morn,"
797,CHIMERA I,The monks do cross them in their blessed scorn
798,CHIMERA I,"And mutter deep anathemas, because"
799,CHIMERA I,"Of the unholy sacrilege, that was"
800,CHIMERA I,"Within the sainted chapel,--for they guess'd,"
801,CHIMERA I,"By many a vestige sad, how the dark rest"
802,CHIMERA I,"Of Agathè was broken,--and anon"
803,CHIMERA I,They sought for Julio. The summer sun
804,CHIMERA I,"Arose and and set, with his imperial disc"
805,CHIMERA I,"Toward the ocean-waters, heaving brisk"
806,CHIMERA I,"Before the winds,--but Julio came never:"
807,CHIMERA I,He that was frantic as a foaming river--
808,CHIMERA I,Mad as the fall of leaves upon the tide
809,CHIMERA I,"Of a great tempest, that have fought and died"
810,CHIMERA I,"Along the forest ramparts, and doth still"
811,CHIMERA I,In its death-struggle desperately reel
812,CHIMERA I,"Round with the fallen foliage--he was gone,"
813,CHIMERA I,And none knew whither. Still were chanted on
814,CHIMERA I,"Sad masses, by pale sisters, many a day,"
815,CHIMERA I,And holy requiems sung for Agathè!

823,CHIMERA II,A curse! a curse! the beautiful pale wing
824,CHIMERA II,"Of a sea-bird was worn with wandering,"
825,CHIMERA II,"And, on a sunny rock beside the shore,"
826,CHIMERA II,"It stood, the golden waters gazing o'er;"
827,CHIMERA II,And they were heaving a brown amber flow
828,CHIMERA II,"Of weeds, that glitter'd gloriously below."
829,CHIMERA II,
830,CHIMERA II,"It was the sunset, and the gorgeous hall"
831,CHIMERA II,Of heaven rose up on pillars magical
832,CHIMERA II,"Of living silver, shafting the fair sky"
833,CHIMERA II,Between dark time and great eternity.
834,CHIMERA II,"They rose upon their pedestal of sun,"
835,CHIMERA II,A line of snowy columns! and anon
836,CHIMERA II,Were lost in the rich tracery of cloud
837,CHIMERA II,"That hung along, magnificently proud,"
838,CHIMERA II,"Predicting the pure star-light, that beyond"
839,CHIMERA II,The east was armouring in diamond
840,CHIMERA II,"About the camp of twilight, and was soon"
841,CHIMERA II,"To marshal under the fair champion moon,"
842,CHIMERA II,"That call'd her chariot of unearthly mist,"
843,CHIMERA II,Toward her citadel of amethyst.
844,CHIMERA II,
845,CHIMERA II,A curse! a curse! a lonely man is there
846,CHIMERA II,"By the deep waters, with a burden fair"
847,CHIMERA II,Clasp'd in his wearied arms--'Tis he; 'tis he
848,CHIMERA II,"The brain-struck Julio, and Agathè!"
849,CHIMERA II,"His cowl is back--flung back upon the breeze,"
850,CHIMERA II,"His lofty brow is haggard with disease,"
851,CHIMERA II,As if a wild libation had been pour'd
852,CHIMERA II,"Of lightning on those temples, and they shower'd"
853,CHIMERA II,"A dismal perspiration, like a rain,"
854,CHIMERA II,Shook by the thunder and the hurricane!
855,CHIMERA II,
856,CHIMERA II,"He dropt upon a rock, and by him placed,"
857,CHIMERA II,"Over a bed of sea-pinks growing waste,"
858,CHIMERA II,"The silent ladye, and he mutter'd wild,"
859,CHIMERA II,"Strange words, about a mother, and no child."
860,CHIMERA II,"""And I shall wed thee, Agathè! although"
861,CHIMERA II,"Ours be no God-blest bridal--even so!"""
862,CHIMERA II,"And from the sand he took a silver shell,"
863,CHIMERA II,That had been wasted by the fall and swell
864,CHIMERA II,Of many a moon-borne tide into a ring--
865,CHIMERA II,"A rude, rude ring; it was a snow-white thing,"
866,CHIMERA II,"Where a lone hermit limpet slept and died,"
867,CHIMERA II,"In ages far away. ""Thou art a bride,"
868,CHIMERA II,"Sweet Agathè! Wake up; we must not linger."""
869,CHIMERA II,"He press'd the ring upon her chilly finger,"
870,CHIMERA II,"And to the sea-bird, on its sunny stone,"
871,CHIMERA II,"Shouted, ""Pale priest! thou liest all alone"
872,CHIMERA II,"Upon thy ocean altar, rise away"
873,CHIMERA II,"To our glad bridal!"" and its wings of gray"
874,CHIMERA II,"All lazily it spread, and hover'd by"
875,CHIMERA II,With a wild shriek--a melancholy cry!
876,CHIMERA II,Then swooping slowly o'er the heaving breast
877,CHIMERA II,"Of the blue ocean, vanish'd in the west."
878,CHIMERA II,
879,CHIMERA II,"And Julio is chanting to his bride,"
880,CHIMERA II,"A merry song of his wild heart, that died"
881,CHIMERA II,"On the soft breeze through pinks beside the sea,"
882,CHIMERA II,All rustling in their beauty gladsomely.

890,SONG,"In beauty and in glory, like a shadowing of thee!"
891,SONG,
892,SONG,"A rosary of stars, love! a prayer as we glide,"
893,SONG,"And a whisper in the wind, and a murmur on the tide!"
894,SONG,"And we'll say a fair adieu to the flowers that are seen,"
895,SONG,With shells of silver sown in radiancy between.
896,SONG,
897,SONG,"A rosary of stars, love! the purest they shall be,"
898,SONG,"Like spirits of pale pearls, in the bosom of the sea;"
899,SONG,"Now help thee, virgin mother! with a blessing as we go,"
900,SONG,"Upon the laughing waters, that are wandering below!"
901,SONG,
902,SONG,"He lifted the dead girl, and is away"
903,SONG,"To where a light boat, in its moorings lay,"
904,SONG,"Like a sea-cradle, rocking to the hush"
905,SONG,Of the nurse waters. With a frantic rush
906,SONG,"O'er the wild field of tangles he hath sped,"
907,SONG,And through the shoaling waves that fell and fled
908,SONG,Upon the furrow'd beach.
909,SONG,
910,SONG,The snowy sail
911,SONG,"Is hoisted to the gladly gushing gale,"
912,SONG,That bosom'd its fair canvass with a breast
913,SONG,"Of silver, looking lovely to the west;"
914,SONG,"And at the helm there sits the wither'd one,"
915,SONG,"Gazing and gazing on the sister nun,"
916,SONG,With her fair tresses floating on his knee--
917,SONG,"The beautiful, death-stricken Agathè!"
918,SONG,
919,SONG,"Fast, fast, and far away, the bark hath stood"
920,SONG,"Out toward the great heaving solitude,"
921,SONG,"That gurgled in its deeps, as if the breath"
922,SONG,"Went through its lungs, of agony and death!"
923,SONG,
924,SONG,The sun is lost within the labyrinth
925,SONG,"Of clouds of purple and pale hyacinth,"
926,SONG,That are the frontlet of the sister Sky
927,SONG,Kissing her brother Ocean; and they lie
928,SONG,"Bathing in blushes, till the rival queen"
929,SONG,"Night, with her starry tiar, floateth in--"
930,SONG,A dark and dazzling beauty! that doth draw
931,SONG,Over the light of love a shade of awe
932,SONG,"Most strange, that parts our wonder not the less"
933,SONG,Between her mystery and loveliness!
934,SONG,
935,SONG,"And she is there, that is a pyramid"
936,SONG,"Whereon the stars, the statues of the dead,"
937,SONG,"Are imaged over the eternal hall,"
938,SONG,A group of radiances majestical!
939,SONG,"And Julio looks up, and there they be,"
940,SONG,"And Agathè, and all the waste of Sea,"
941,SONG,"That slept in wizard slumber, with a shroud"
942,SONG,"Of night flung o'er his bosom, throbbing proud"
943,SONG,Amid its azure pulses; and again
944,SONG,"He dropt his blighted eye-orbs, with a strain"
945,SONG,Of mirth upon the ladye:--Agathè!
946,SONG,"Sweet bride! be thou a queen, and I will lay"
947,SONG,A crown of sea-weed on thy royal brow;
948,SONG,"And I will twine these tresses, that are now"
949,SONG,"Floating beside me, to a diadem;"
950,SONG,"And the sea foam will sprinkle gem on gem,"
951,SONG,And so will the soft dews. Be thou the queen
952,SONG,"Of the unpeopled waters, sadly seen"
953,SONG,"By star-light, till the yet unrisen moon"
954,SONG,"Issue, unveiled, from her anderoon,"
955,SONG,"To bathe in the sea fountains: let me say,"
956,SONG,"""Hail--hail to thee! thrice hail, my Agathè!"""
957,SONG,
958,SONG,The warrior world was lifting to the bent
959,SONG,"Of his eternal brow magnificent,"
960,SONG,"The fiery moon, that in her blazonry"
961,SONG,"Shone eastward, like a shield. The throbbing sea"
962,SONG,"Felt fever on his azure arteries,"
963,SONG,"That shadow'd them with crimson, while the breeze"
964,SONG,Fell faster on the solitary sail.
965,SONG,"But the red moon grew loftier and pale,"
966,SONG,"And the great ocean, like the holy hall,"
967,SONG,"Where slept a seraph host maritimal,"
968,SONG,"Was gorgeous, with wings of diamond"
969,SONG,"Fann'd over it, and millions beyond"
970,SONG,"Of tiny waves were playing to and fro,"
971,SONG,"All musical, with an incessant flow"
972,SONG,"Of cadences, innumerably heard"
973,SONG,"Between the shrill notes of a hermit bird,"
974,SONG,That held a solemn paean to the moon.
975,SONG,
976,SONG,A few devotional fair clouds were soon
977,SONG,"Breathed o'er the living countenance of Heaven,"
978,SONG,And under the great galaxies were driven
979,SONG,"Of stars that group'd together, and they went"
980,SONG,"Like voyagers along the firmament,"
981,SONG,And grew to silver in the blessed light
982,SONG,"Of the moon alchymist. It was not night,"
983,SONG,"Not the dark deathly shadow, that falls o'er"
984,SONG,"The eye-lid like a curse, but far before"
985,SONG,"In splendour, struggling through a fall of gloom,"
986,SONG,"In many a myriad gushes, that do come"
987,SONG,"Direct from the eternal stars beyond,"
988,SONG,Like holy fountains pouring diamond!
989,SONG,
990,SONG,"A sail! awake thee, Julio! a sail!"
991,SONG,And be not bending to thy trances pale.
992,SONG,But he is gazing on the moonlit brow
993,SONG,"Of his dead Agathè, and fondly now,"
994,SONG,The light is silvering her bloodless face
995,SONG,And the cold grave-clothes. There is loveliness
996,SONG,"As in a marble image, very bright!"
997,SONG,But stricken with a phantasy of light
998,SONG,"That is not given to the mortal hue,"
999,SONG,To life and breathing beauty: and she too
1000,SONG,"Is more of the expressless lineament,"
1001,SONG,Than of the golden thoughts that came and went
1002,SONG,Over her features like a living tide
1003,SONG,No while before.
1004,SONG,
1005,SONG,A sail is on the wide
1006,SONG,"And moving waters, and it draweth nigh"
1007,SONG,Like a sea-cloud. The elfin billows fly
1008,SONG,"Before it, in their armories enthrall'd"
1009,SONG,Of radiant and moon-breasted emerald;
1010,SONG,And many is the mariner that sees
1011,SONG,"The lone boat in the melancholy breeze,"
1012,SONG,"Waving her snowy canvass, and anon"
1013,SONG,Their stately vessel with a gallant run
1014,SONG,Crowds by in all her glory; but the cheer
1015,SONG,"Of men is pass'd into a sudden fear,"
1016,SONG,"And whisperings, and shakings of the head--"
1017,SONG,"The moon was streaming on a virgin dead,"
1018,SONG,"And Julio sat over her insane,"
1019,SONG,"Like a sea demon! O'er and o'er again,"
1020,SONG,"Each cross'd him, as the stately vessel stood"
1021,SONG,Far out into the murmuring solitude!
1022,SONG,
1023,SONG,But Julio saw not; he only heard
1024,SONG,"A rushing, like the passing of a bird,"
1025,SONG,"And felt him heaving on the foam, that flew"
1026,SONG,Along the startled billows; and he knew
1027,SONG,"Of a strange sail, by broken oaths that fell"
1028,SONG,"Beside him, on the coming of the swell."
1029,SONG,
1030,SONG,"They knew thou wert a queen, my royal bride!"
1031,SONG,And made obeisance at thy holy side.
1032,SONG,"They saw thee, Agathè! and go to bring"
1033,SONG,"Fair worshippers, and many a poet-king,"
1034,SONG,To utter music at thy pearly feet.--
1035,SONG,"Now, wake thee! for the moonlight cometh sweet,"
1036,SONG,To visit in thy temple of the sea;
1037,SONG,Thy sister moon is watching over thee!
1038,SONG,And she is spreading a fair mantle of
1039,SONG,"Pure silver, in thy lonely palace, love!--"
1040,SONG,"Now, wake thee! for the sea-bird is aloof,"
1041,SONG,"In solitude, below the starry roof;"
1042,SONG,And on its dewy plume there is a light
1043,SONG,"Of palest splendour, o'er the blessed night."
1044,SONG,"Thy spirit, Agathè!--and yet, thou art"
1045,SONG,"Beside me, and my solitary heart"
1046,SONG,Is throbbing near to thee: I must not feel
1047,SONG,The sweet notes of thy holy music steal
1048,SONG,"Into my feverous and burning brain,--"
1049,SONG,So wake not! and I'll hush thee with a strain
1050,SONG,"Of my wild fancy, till thou dream of me,"
1051,SONG,And I be loved as I have loved thee:--
1052,SONG,
1053,SONG,
1054,SONG,SONG
1055,SONG,
1056,SONG,"'Tis light to love thee living, girl, when hope is full and fair,"
1057,SONG,"In the springtide of thy beauty, when there is no sorrow there--"
1058,SONG,"No sorrow on thy brow, and no shadow on thy heart!"
1059,SONG,"When, like a floating sea-bird, bright and beautiful thou art!"
1060,SONG,
1061,SONG,"'Tis light to love thee living, girl--to see thee ever so,"
1062,SONG,"With health, that, like a crimson flower, lies blushing in the snow;"
1063,SONG,"And thy tresses falling over, like the amber on the pearl--"
1064,SONG,"Oh! true it is a lightsome thing, to love thee living, girl!"
1065,SONG,
1066,SONG,"But when the brow is blighted, like a star of morning tide,"
1067,SONG,And faded is the crimson blush upon the cheek beside;
1068,SONG,"It is to love, as seldom love, the brightest and the best,"
1069,SONG,When our love lies like a dew upon the one that is at rest.
1070,SONG,
1071,SONG,"Because of hopes, that, fallen, are changing to despair,"
1072,SONG,"And the heart is always dreaming on the ruin that is there,"
1073,SONG,"Oh, true! 'tis weary, weary, to be gazing over thee,"
1074,SONG,And the light of thy pure vision breaketh never upon me!
1075,SONG,
1076,SONG,"He lifts her in his arms, and o'er and o'er,"
1077,SONG,"Upon the brow of chilliness and hoar,"
1078,SONG,Repeats a silent kiss;--along the side
1079,SONG,"Of the lone bark, he leans that pallid bride,"
1080,SONG,Until the waves do image her within
1081,SONG,"Their bosom, like a spectre--'Tis a sin"
1082,SONG,"Too deadly to be shadow'd or forgiven,"
1083,SONG,To do such mockery in the sight of Heaven!
1084,SONG,"And bid her gaze into the startled sea,"
1085,SONG,"And say, ""Thy image, from eternity,"
1086,SONG,"Hath come to meet thee, ladye!"" and anon,"
1087,SONG,"He bade the cold corse kiss the shadowy one,"
1088,SONG,"That shook amid the waters, like the light"
1089,SONG,Of borealis in a winter night!
1090,SONG,
1091,SONG,"And after, he did strain her sea-wet hair"
1092,SONG,"Between his chilly fingers, with a stare"
1093,SONG,"Of mystery, that marvell'd how that she"
1094,SONG,Had drench'd it so amid the moonlit sea.
1095,SONG,"The morning rose, with breast of living gold,"
1096,SONG,"Like eastern phoenix, and his plumage roll'd"
1097,SONG,"In clouds of molted brilliance, very bright!"
1098,SONG,And on the waste of waters floated light.--
1099,SONG,
1100,SONG,"In truth, 'twas strange to see that merry bark"
1101,SONG,"Skimming the silver ocean, like a shark"
1102,SONG,"At play amid the beautiful sea-green,"
1103,SONG,And all so sadly desolate within.
1104,SONG,
1105,SONG,"And hours flew after hours, a weary length,"
1106,SONG,"Until the sunlight, in meridian strength,"
1107,SONG,Threw burning floods upon the wasted brow
1108,SONG,Of that sea-hermit mariner; and now
1109,SONG,"He felt the fire-light feed upon his brain,"
1110,SONG,"And started with intensity of pain,"
1111,SONG,And wash'd him in the sea; it only brought
1112,SONG,"Wild reason, like a demon, and he thought"
1113,SONG,"Strange thoughts, like dreaming men--he thought how those"
1114,SONG,"Were round him he had seen, and many rose"
1115,SONG,His heart had hated; every billow threw
1116,SONG,"Features before him, and pale faces grew"
1117,SONG,Out of the sea by myriads:--the self-same
1118,SONG,"Was moulded from its image, and they came"
1119,SONG,"In groups together, and all said, like one,"
1120,SONG,"""Be cursed!"" and vanish'd in the deep anon."
1121,SONG,"Then thirst, intolerable as the breath"
1122,SONG,"Of Upas, fanning the wild wings of death,"
1123,SONG,"Crept up his very gorge,--like to a snake,"
1124,SONG,"That stifled him, and bade the pulses ache"
1125,SONG,Through all the boiling current of his blood.
1126,SONG,"It was a thirst, that let the fever flood"
1127,SONG,"Fall over him, and gave a ghastly hue"
1128,SONG,"To his cramp'd lips, until their breathing grew"
1129,SONG,"White as a mist, and short, and like a sigh,"
1130,SONG,"Heaved with a struggle, till it falter'd by."
1131,SONG,
1132,SONG,And ever he did look upon the corse
1133,SONG,"With idiot visage, like the hag Remorse"
1134,SONG,That gloateth over on a nameless deed
1135,SONG,Of darkness and of dole unhistoried.
1136,SONG,"And were there that might hear him, they would hear"
1137,SONG,"The murmur of a prayer in deep fear,"
1138,SONG,"Through unbarr'd lips, escaping by the half,"
1139,SONG,"And all but smother'd by a maniac laugh,"
1140,SONG,"That follow'd it, so sudden and so shrill,"
1141,SONG,"That swarms of sea-birds, wandering at will"
1142,SONG,"Upon the wave, rose startled, and away"
1143,SONG,"Went flocking, like a silver shower of spray!"
1144,SONG,"And aye he called for water, and the sea"
1145,SONG,"Mock'd him with his brine surges tauntingly,"
1146,SONG,"And lash'd them over on his fev'rous brow,"
1147,SONG,"Volleying roars of curses:--""Stay thee, now,"
1148,SONG,Avenger! lest I die; for I am worn
1149,SONG,Fainter than star-light at the birth of morn;
1150,SONG,"Stay thee, great angel! for I am not shriven,"
1151,SONG,But frantic as thyself: Oh Heaven! Heaven!
1152,SONG,"But thou hast made me brother of the sea,"
1153,SONG,That I may tremble at his tyranny;
1154,SONG,"Or am I slave? a very, very jest"
1155,SONG,To the sarcastic waters? let me breast
1156,SONG,"The base insulters, and defy them so,"
1157,SONG,In this lone little skiff--I am your foe!
1158,SONG,"Ye raving, lion-like, and ramping seas,"
1159,SONG,"That open up your nostrils to the breeze,"
1160,SONG,"And fain would swallow me! Do ye not fly,"
1161,SONG,"Pale, sick, and gurgling, as I pass you by?"""
1162,SONG,
1163,SONG,"""Lift up! and let me see, that I may tell"
1164,SONG,"Ye can be mad, and strange, and terrible;"
1165,SONG,"That ye have power, and passion, and a sound"
1166,SONG,As of the flying of an angel round
1167,SONG,"The mighty world; that ye are one with time,"
1168,SONG,And in the great primordium sublime
1169,SONG,"Were nursed together, as an infant-twain,--"
1170,SONG,A glory and a wonder! I would fain
1171,SONG,"Hold truce, thou elder brother! for we are,"
1172,SONG,"In feature, as the sun is to a star,"
1173,SONG,"So are we like, and we are touch'd in tune"
1174,SONG,"With lunacy as music; and the moon,"
1175,SONG,That setteth the tides sentinel before
1176,SONG,"Thy camp of waters, on the pebbled shore,"
1177,SONG,"And measures their great footsteps to and fro,"
1178,SONG,Hath lifted up into my brain the flow
1179,SONG,Of this mad tide of blood.--Ay! we are like
1180,SONG,"In foam and frenzy; the same winds do strike,"
1181,SONG,"The same fierce sun-rays, from their battlement"
1182,SONG,"Of fire! so, when I perish impotent"
1183,SONG,"Before the night of death, they'll say of me,"
1184,SONG,"He died as mad and frantic, as the sea!"""
1185,SONG,
1186,SONG,"A cloud stood for the east, a cloud like night,"
1187,SONG,"Like a huge vulture, and the blessed light"
1188,SONG,Of the great sun grew shadow'd awfully:
1189,SONG,"It seem'd to mount up from the mighty sea,"
1190,SONG,"Shaking the showers from its solemn wings,"
1191,SONG,"And grew, and grew, and many a myriad springs,"
1192,SONG,"Were on its bosom, teeming full of rain."
1193,SONG,There fell a terrible and wizard chain
1194,SONG,"Of lightning, from its black and heated forge,"
1195,SONG,"And the dark waters took it to their gorge,"
1196,SONG,And lifted up their shaggy flanks in wonder
1197,SONG,"With rival chorus to the peal of thunder,"
1198,SONG,That wheel'd in many a squadron terrible
1199,SONG,"The stern black clouds, and as they rose and fell"
1200,SONG,They oozed great showers; and Julio held up
1201,SONG,"His wasted hands, in likeness of a cup,"
1202,SONG,"And drank the blessed waters, and they roll'd"
1203,SONG,"Upon his cheeks like tears, but sadly cold!--"
1204,SONG,'Twas very strange to look on Agathè!
1205,SONG,"How the quick lightnings, in their elfin play,"
1206,SONG,"Stream'd pale upon her features, and they were"
1207,SONG,"Sickly, like tapers in a sepulchre!"
1208,SONG,
1209,SONG,"The ship! that self same ship, that Julio knew"
1210,SONG,"Had pass'd him, with her panic-stricken crew,"
1211,SONG,"She gleams amid the storm, a shatter'd thing"
1212,SONG,Of pride and lordly beauty: her fair wing
1213,SONG,Of sail is wounded--the proud pennon gone:
1214,SONG,"Dark, dark she sweepeth like an eagle, on"
1215,SONG,"Through waters that are battling to and fro,"
1216,SONG,And tossing their great giant shrouds of snow
1217,SONG,"Over her deck. Ahead, and there is seen"
1218,SONG,"A black, strange line of breakers, down between"
1219,SONG,"The awful surges, lifting up their manes,"
1220,SONG,Like great sea lions. Quick and high she strains
1221,SONG,Her foaming keel--that solitary ship!
1222,SONG,"As if, in all her frenzy, she would leap"
1223,SONG,"The cursed barrier; forward, fast and fast--"
1224,SONG,"Back, back she reels; her timbers and her mast"
1225,SONG,Split in a thousand shivers! A white spring
1226,SONG,Of the exulted sea rose bantering
1227,SONG,"Over her ruin; and the mighty crew,"
1228,SONG,"That mann'd her decks, were seen, a straggling few,"
1229,SONG,Far scatter'd on the surges. Julio felt
1230,SONG,"The impulse of that hour, and low he knelt,"
1231,SONG,Within his own light bark--a prayful man!
1232,SONG,"And clasp'd his lifeless bride; and to her wan,"
1233,SONG,Cold cheek did lay his melancholy brow.--
1234,SONG,"""Save thou a mariner!"" He starteth now"
1235,SONG,"To hear that dying cry; and there is one,"
1236,SONG,"All worn and wave-wet, by his bark anon,"
1237,SONG,"Clinging, in terror of the ireful sea,"
1238,SONG,A fair hair'd mariner! But suddenly
1239,SONG,"He saw the pale dead ladye, by a flame"
1240,SONG,"Of blue and livid lightning, and there came"
1241,SONG,"Over his features blindness, and the power"
1242,SONG,"Of his strong hands grew weak,--a giant shower"
1243,SONG,"Of foam rose up, and swept him far along;"
1244,SONG,And Julio saw him buffeting the throng
1245,SONG,"Of the great eddying waters, till they went"
1246,SONG,Over him--a wind-shaken cerement!
1247,SONG,
1248,SONG,"Then terribly he laugh'd, and rose above"
1249,SONG,His soul-less bride--the ladye of his love
1250,SONG,"Lifting him up, in all his wizard glee;"
1251,SONG,"And he did wave, before the frantic sea,"
1252,SONG,"His wasted arm. ""Adieu! adieu! adieu!"
1253,SONG,"Thou sawest how we were; thou sawest, too,"
1254,SONG,Thou wert not so; for in the inmost shrine
1255,SONG,Of my deep heart are thoughts that are not thine.
1256,SONG,"And thou art gone, fair mariner! in foam"
1257,SONG,"And music-murmurs, to thy blessed home--"
1258,SONG,Adieu! adieu! Thou sawest how that she
1259,SONG,"Sleeps in her holy beauty, tranquilly;"
1260,SONG,And when the fair and floating vision breaks
1261,SONG,"From her pure brow, and Agathè awakes--"
1262,SONG,"Till then, we meet not; so adieu, adieu!"""
1263,SONG,"Still on before the sullen tempest flew,"
1264,SONG,"Fast as a meteor star, the lonely bark:"
1265,SONG,"And Julio bent over to the dark,"
1266,SONG,"The solitary sea, for close beside"
1267,SONG,Floated the stringed harp of one that died
1268,SONG,"In that wild shipwreck, and he drew it home,"
1269,SONG,"With madness, to his bosom: the white foam"
1270,SONG,Was o'er its strings; and on the streaming sail
1271,SONG,"He wiped them, running, with his fingers pale,"
1272,SONG,"Along the tuneless notes, that only gave"
1273,SONG,Seldom responses to his wandering stave!
1274,SONG,
1275,SONG,
1276,SONG,
1277,SONG,
1278,TO THE HARP,TO THE HARP
1279,TO THE HARP,
1280,TO THE HARP,
1281,I,I
1282,I,
1283,I,Jewel! that lay before the heart
1284,I,"Of some romantic boy,"
1285,I,"And startled music in her home,"
1286,I,Of mystery and joy!
1287,I,
1288,I,
1289,II,II
1290,II,
1291,II,The image of his love was there;
1292,II,"And, with her golden wings,"
1293,II,She swept her tone of sorrow from
1294,II,Thy melancholy strings!
1295,II,
1296,II,
1297,III,III
1298,III,
1299,III,"We drew thee, as an orphan one,"
1300,III,From waters that had cast
1301,III,"No music round thee, as they went"
1302,III,In their pale beauty past.
1303,III,
1304,III,
1305,IV,IV
1306,IV,
1307,IV,No music but the changeless sigh--
1308,IV,"That murmur of their own,"
1309,IV,That loves not blending in the thrill
1310,IV,Of thine aerial tone.
1311,IV,
1312,IV,
1313,V,V
1314,V,
1315,V,The girl that slumbers at our side
1316,V,"Will dream how they are bent,"
1317,V,That love her even as they love
1318,V,Thy blessed instrument.
1319,V,
1320,V,
1321,VI,VI
1322,VI,
1323,VI,"And music, like a flood, will break"
1324,VI,Upon the fairy throne
1325,VI,"Of her pure heart, all glowing, like"
1326,VI,"A morning star, alone!"
1327,VI,
1328,VI,
1329,VII,VII
1330,VII,
1331,VII,"Alone, but for the song of him"
1332,VII,"That waketh by her side,"
1333,VII,And strikes thy chords of silver to
1334,VII,His fair and sea-borne bride.
1335,VII,
1336,VII,
1337,VIII,VIII
1338,VIII,
1339,VIII,Jewel! that hung before the heart
1340,VIII,Of some romantic boy;
1341,VIII,"Like him, I sweep thee with a storm"
1342,VIII,Of music and of joy!
1343,VIII,
1344,VIII,And Julio placed the trembling harp before
1345,VIII,"The ladye, till the minstrel winds came o'er"
1346,VIII,"Its moisten'd strings, and tuned them with a sigh."
1347,VIII,"""I hear thee, how thy spirit goeth by,"
1348,VIII,In music and in love. Oh Agathè!
1349,VIII,"Thou sleepest long, long, long; and they will say"
1350,VIII,"That seek thee,--'She is dead--she is no more!'"
1351,VIII,"But thou art cold, and I will throw before"
1352,VIII,"Thy chilly brow the pale and snowy sheet."""
1353,VIII,"And he did lift it from her marble feet,"
1354,VIII,The sea-wet shroud! and flung it silently
1355,VIII,Over her brow--the brow of Agathè!
1356,VIII,
1357,VIII,"But, as a passion from the mooded mind,"
1358,VIII,"The storm had died, and wearily the wind"
1359,VIII,"Fell fast asleep at evening, like one"
1360,VIII,That hath been toiling in the fiery sun.
1361,VIII,"And the white sail dropt downward, as the wing"
1362,VIII,"Of wounded sea-bird, feebly murmuring"
1363,VIII,"Unto the mast. It was a deathly calm,"
1364,VIII,"And holy stillness, like a shadow, swam"
1365,VIII,"All over the wide sea, and the boat stood."
1366,VIII,"Like her of Sodom, in the solitude,"
1367,VIII,"A snowy pillar, looking on the waste."
1368,VIII,And there was nothing but the azure breast
1369,VIII,"Of ocean and the sky--the sea and sky,"
1370,VIII,And the lone bark; no clouds were floating by
1371,VIII,"Where the sun set, but his great seraph light,"
1372,VIII,"Went down alone, in majesty and might;"
1373,VIII,"And the stars came again, a silver troop,"
1374,VIII,"Until, in shame, the coward shadows droop"
1375,VIII,"Before the radiance of these holy gems,"
1376,VIII,That bear the images of diadems!
1377,VIII,
1378,VIII,And Julio fancied of a form that rose
1379,VIII,Before him from the desolate repose
1380,VIII,"Of the deep waters--a huge ghastly form,"
1381,VIII,As of one lightning-stricken in a storm;
1382,VIII,And leprosy cadaverous was hung
1383,VIII,"Before his brow, and awful terror flung"
1384,VIII,Around him like a pall--a solemn shroud!--
1385,VIII,A drapery of darkness and of cloud!
1386,VIII,"And agony was writhing on his lip,"
1387,VIII,"Heart-rooted, awful agony and deep,"
1388,VIII,"Of fevers, and of plagues, and burning blain,"
1389,VIII,"And ague, and the palsy of the brain--"
1390,VIII,A wierd and yellow spectre! And his eyes
1391,VIII,"Were orbless and unpupil'd, as the skies"
1392,VIII,"Without the sun, or moon, or any star:"
1393,VIII,"And he was like the wreck of what men are,--"
1394,VIII,"A wasted skeleton, that held the crest"
1395,VIII,"Of Time, and bore his motto on his breast!"
1396,VIII,
1397,VIII,"There came a group before of maladies,"
1398,VIII,"And griefs, and Famine empty as a breeze,--"
1399,VIII,"A double monster, with a gloating leer"
1400,VIII,"Fix'd on his other half. They drew them near,"
1401,VIII,"One after one, led onward by Despair,"
1402,VIII,"That like the last of winter glimmer'd there,--"
1403,VIII,"A dismal prologue to his brother Death,"
1404,VIII,"Which was behind, and, with the horrid breath"
1405,VIII,"Of his wide baneful nostrils, plied them on."
1406,VIII,And often as they saw the skeleton
1407,VIII,"Grisly beside them, the wild phantasies"
1408,VIII,Grew mad and howl'd; the fever of disease
1409,VIII,Became wild frenzy--very terrible!
1410,VIII,"And, for a hell of agony--a hell"
1411,VIII,"Of rage, was there, that fed on misty things,"
1412,VIII,"On dreams, ideas, and imaginings."
1413,VIII,
1414,VIII,"And some were raving on philosophy,"
1415,VIII,"And some on love, and some on jealousy,"
1416,VIII,And some upon the moon; and these were they
1417,VIII,That were the wildest; and anon alway
1418,VIII,Julio knew them by a something dim
1419,VIII,About their wasted features like to him!
1420,VIII,
1421,VIII,"But Death was by, like shell of pyramid"
1422,VIII,"Among old obelisks, and his eyeless head"
1423,VIII,"Shook o'er the wiery ribs, where darkness lay"
1424,VIII,The image of a heart--He is away!
1425,VIII,"And Julio is watching, like Remorse,"
1426,VIII,Over the pale and solitary corse!
1427,VIII,
1428,VIII,"Shower soft light, ye stars, that shake the dew"
1429,VIII,"From your eternal blossoms! and thou, too,"
1430,VIII,"Moon! minded of thy power, tide-bearing queen!"
1431,VIII,That hast a slave and votary within
1432,VIII,"The great rock-fetter'd deeps, and hearest cry"
1433,VIII,"To thee the hungry surges, rushing by"
1434,VIII,"Like a vast herd of wolves,--fall full and fair"
1435,VIII,"On Julio as he sleepeth, even there,"
1436,VIII,Amid the suppliant bosom of the sea!--
1437,VIII,"Sleep! dost thou come, and on thy blessed knee"
1438,VIII,With hush and whisper lull the troubled brain
1439,VIII,Of this death-lover?--Still the eyes do strain
1440,VIII,Their orbs on Agathè--those raven eyes!
1441,VIII,All earnest on the ladye as she lies
1442,VIII,"In her white shroud. They see not, though they are"
1443,VIII,As if they saw; no splendour like a star
1444,VIII,Is under their dark lashes: they are full
1445,VIII,"Of dream and slumber--melancholy, dull!"
1446,VIII,
1447,VIII,*       *       *       *       *
1448,VIII,
1449,VIII,"A wide, wide sea! and on its rear and van"
1450,VIII,"Amid the stars, the silent meteors ran"
1451,VIII,"All that still night, and Julio with a cry"
1452,VIII,"Woke up, and saw them flashing fiercely by."
1453,VIII,
1454,VIII,*       *       *       *       *
1455,VIII,
1456,VIII,"Full three times three, its awful veil of night"
1457,VIII,Hath Heaven hung before the blessed light;
1458,VIII,"And a fair breeze falls o'er the sleeping sea,"
1459,VIII,Where Julio is watching Agathè!
1460,VIII,By sun and darkness hath he bent him over--
1461,VIII,"A mad, moon-stricken, melancholy lover!"
1462,VIII,
1463,VIII,"And hardly hath he tasted, night or day,"
1464,VIII,"Of drink or food, because of Agathè!"
1465,VIII,"He sitteth in a dull and dreary mood,"
1466,VIII,"Like statue in a ruin'd solitude,"
1467,VIII,Bearing the brent of sunlight and of shade
1468,VIII,Over the marble of some colonnade.
1469,VIII,
1470,VIII,"The ladye, she hath lost the pearly hue"
1471,VIII,"Upon her gorgeous brow, where tresses grew"
1472,VIII,"Luxuriantly as thoughts of tenderness,"
1473,VIII,That once were floating in the pure recess
1474,VIII,"Of her bright soul. These are not as they were,"
1475,VIII,"But are as weeds above a sepulchre,"
1476,VIII,Wild waving in the breeze: her eyes are now
1477,VIII,"Sunk deeply under the discolour'd brow,"
1478,VIII,"That is of sickly yellow, and pale blue,"
1479,VIII,Unnaturally blending. The same hue
1480,VIII,Is on her cheek: it is the early breath
1481,VIII,"Of cold Corruption, the ban dog of Death,"
1482,VIII,"Falling upon her features.--Let it be,"
1483,VIII,"And gaze awhile on Julio, as he"
1484,VIII,Is gazing on the corse of Agathè!
1485,VIII,
1486,VIII,"In truth, he seemeth like no living one,"
1487,VIII,But is the image of a skeleton:
1488,VIII,A fearful portrait from the artist tool
1489,VIII,Of Madness--terrible and wonderful!
1490,VIII,
1491,VIII,There was no passion there--no feeling traced
1492,VIII,"Under those eyelids, where had run to waste,"
1493,VIII,"All that was wild, or beautiful, or bright;"
1494,VIII,"A very cloud was cast upon their light,"
1495,VIII,That gave to them the heavy hue of lead;
1496,VIII,"And they were lorn, and lustreless, and dead!"
1497,VIII,"He sate like vulture from the mountains gray,"
1498,VIII,"Unsated, that had flown full many a day"
1499,VIII,"O'er distant land and sea, and was in pride"
1500,VIII,Alighted by the lonely ladye's side.
1501,VIII,
1502,VIII,He sate like winter o'er the wasted year--
1503,VIII,"Like melancholy winter, drawing near"
1504,VIII,"To its own death.--""Oh me! the worm, at last,"
1505,VIII,"Will gorge upon me, and the autumn blast"
1506,VIII,Howl by!--Where?--where?--there is no worm to creep
1507,VIII,Amid the waters of the lonely deep;
1508,VIII,But I will take me Agathè upon
1509,VIII,"This sorrowful, sore bosom, and anon,"
1510,VIII,"Down, down, through azure silence, we shall go,"
1511,VIII,"Unepitaph'd, to cities far below;"
1512,VIII,"Where the sea triton, with his winding shell,"
1513,VIII,Shall sound our blessed welcome. We shall dwell
1514,VIII,"With many a mariner in his pearly home,"
1515,VIII,"In bowers of amber weed and silver foam,"
1516,VIII,Amid the crimson corals; we shall be
1517,VIII,"Together, Agathè! fair Agathè!--"
1518,VIII,"But thou art sickly, ladye--thou art sad;"
1519,VIII,"And I am weary, ladye--I am mad!"
1520,VIII,"They bring no food to feed us, and I feel"
1521,VIII,"A frost upon my vitals, very chill,"
1522,VIII,Like winter breaking on the golden year
1523,VIII,"Of life. This bark shall be our floating bier,"
1524,VIII,"And the dark waves our mourners; and the white,"
1525,VIII,"Pure swarm of sunny sea birds, basking bright"
1526,VIII,"On some far isle, shall sorrowfully pour"
1527,VIII,"Their wail of melancholy o'er and o'er,"
1528,VIII,"At evening, on the waters of the sea,--"
1529,VIII,"While, with its solemn burden, silently,"
1530,VIII,"Floats forward our lone bark.--Oh, Agathè!"
1531,VIII,"Methinks that I shall meet thee far away,"
1532,VIII,"Within the awful centre of the earth,"
1533,VIII,"Where, earliest, we had our holy birth--"
1534,VIII,"In some huge cavern, arching wide below,"
1535,VIII,"Upon whose airy pivot, years ago,"
1536,VIII,"The world went round: 'tis infinitely deep,"
1537,VIII,"But never dismal; for above it sleep,"
1538,VIII,"And under it, blue waters, hung aloof,"
1539,VIII,"And held below,--an amethystine roof,"
1540,VIII,"A sapphire pavement; and the golden sun,"
1541,VIII,"Afar, looks through alternately, like one"
1542,VIII,"That watches round some treasure: often, too,"
1543,VIII,"Through many a mile of ocean, sparkling through,"
1544,VIII,"Are seen the stars and moon, all gloriously,"
1545,VIII,"Bathing their angel brilliance in the sea!"""
1546,VIII,
1547,VIII,"""And there are shafted pillars, that beyond,"
1548,VIII,"Are ranged before a rock of diamond,"
1549,VIII,"Awfully heaving its eternal heights,"
1550,VIII,From base of silver strewn with chrysolites;
1551,VIII,"And over it are chasms of glory seen,"
1552,VIII,"With crimson rubies clustering between,"
1553,VIII,"On sward of emerald, with leaves of pearl,"
1554,VIII,And topazes hung brilliantly on beryl.
1555,VIII,"So Agathè!--but thou art sickly sad,"
1556,VIII,"And tellest me, poor Julio is mad--"
1557,VIII,"Ay, mad!--was he not madder when he sware"
1558,VIII,"A vow to Heaven? was there no madness there,"
1559,VIII,That he should do--for why?--a holy string
1560,VIII,Of penances? No penances will bring
1561,VIII,The stricken conscience to the blessed light
1562,VIII,"Of peace,--Oh! I am lost, and there is night,"
1563,VIII,"Despair and darkness, darkness and despair,"
1564,VIII,"And want, that hunts me to the lion-lair"
1565,VIII,Of wild perdition: and I hear them all--
1566,VIII,All cursing me! The very sun-rays fall
1567,VIII,"In curses, and the shadow of the moon,"
1568,VIII,"And the pale star light, and the winds that tune"
1569,VIII,"Their voices to the music of the sea,--"
1570,VIII,"And thou,--yes, thou! my gentle Agathè!--"
1571,VIII,"All curse me!--Oh! that I were never, never!--"
1572,VIII,"Or but a breathless fancy, that was ever"
1573,VIII,"Adrift upon the wilderness of Time,"
1574,VIII,"That knew no impulse, but was left sublime"
1575,VIII,To play at its own will!--that I were hush'd
1576,VIII,"At night by silver cataracts, that gush'd"
1577,VIII,"Through flowers of fairy hue, and then to die"
1578,VIII,"Away, with all before me passing by,"
1579,VIII,"Like a fair vision I had lived to see,"
1580,VIII,And died to see no more!--It cannot be!
1581,VIII,"By this right hand! I feel it is not so,"
1582,VIII,"And by the beating of a heart below,"
1583,VIII,"That strangely feareth for eternity!"""
1584,VIII,
1585,VIII,"He said, and gazing on the lonely sea,"
1586,VIII,"Far off he saw, like an ascending cloud,"
1587,VIII,"To westward, a bright island, lifted proud"
1588,VIII,"Amid the struggling waters, and the light"
1589,VIII,"Of the great sun was on its clifted height,"
1590,VIII,"Scattering golden shadow, like a mirror;"
1591,VIII,But the gigantic billows sprung in terror
1592,VIII,"Upon its rock-built and eternal shore,"
1593,VIII,With silver foams that fell in fury o'er
1594,VIII,"A thousand sunny breakers. Far above,"
1595,VIII,There stood a wild and solitary grove
1596,VIII,"Of aged pines, all leafless but their brows,"
1597,VIII,Where a green group of tempest-stricken boughs
1598,VIII,"Was waving now and then, and to and fro,"
1599,VIII,And the pale moss was clustering below.
1600,VIII,
1601,VIII,"Then Julio saw, and bent his head away"
1602,VIII,"To the cold wasted corse of Agathè,"
1603,VIII,And sigh'd; but ever he would turn again
1604,VIII,A gaze to that green island on the main.
1605,VIII,
1606,VIII,"The bark is drifting through the surf, beside"
1607,VIII,Its rocks of gray upon the coming tide;
1608,VIII,And lightly is it stranded on the shore
1609,VIII,"Of pure and silver shells, that lie before,"
1610,VIII,Glittering in the glory of the sun;
1611,VIII,"And Julio hath landed him, like one"
1612,VIII,That aileth of some wild and weary pest;
1613,VIII,"And Agathè is folded on his breast,--"
1614,VIII,A faded flower! with all the vernal dews
1615,VIII,"From its bright blossom shaken, and the hues"
1616,VIII,Become as colourless as twilight air--
1617,VIII,"I marvel much, that she was ever fair!"
1618,VIII,
1619,VIII,
1620,VIII,
1621,VIII,
1622,CHIMERA III,CHIMERA III
1623,CHIMERA III,
1624,CHIMERA III,
1625,CHIMERA III,Another moon! and over the blue night
1626,CHIMERA III,"She bendeth, like a holy spirit bright,"
1627,CHIMERA III,Through stars that veil them in their wings of gold;
1628,CHIMERA III,As on she floateth with her image cold
1629,CHIMERA III,Enamell'd on the deep. A sail of cloud
1630,CHIMERA III,"Is to her left, majestically proud!"
1631,CHIMERA III,Trailing its silver drapery away
1632,CHIMERA III,"In thin and fairy webs, that are at play"
1633,CHIMERA III,Like stormless waves upon a summer sea
1634,CHIMERA III,Dragging their length of waters lazily.
1635,CHIMERA III,
1636,CHIMERA III,"Ay! to the rocks! and thou wilt see, I wist,"
1637,CHIMERA III,"A lonely one, that bendeth in the mist"
1638,CHIMERA III,"Of moonlight, with a wild and raven pall"
1639,CHIMERA III,Flung round him. Is he mortal man at all?
1640,CHIMERA III,"For, by the meagre fire-light that is under"
1641,CHIMERA III,"Those eyelids, and the vizor shade of wonder"
1642,CHIMERA III,"Falling upon his features, I would guess,"
1643,CHIMERA III,Of one that wanders out of blessedness!
1644,CHIMERA III,Julio! raise thee!--By the holy mass!
1645,CHIMERA III,I wot not of the fearless one would pass
1646,CHIMERA III,Thy wizard shadow. Where the raven hair
1647,CHIMERA III,"Was shorn before, in many a matted layer"
1648,CHIMERA III,It lieth now; and on a rock beside
1649,CHIMERA III,"The sea, like merman at the ebb of tide,"
1650,CHIMERA III,"Feasting his wondrous vision on Decay,"
1651,CHIMERA III,So art thou gazing over Agathè!
1652,CHIMERA III,
1653,CHIMERA III,"Ah me! but this is never the fair girl,"
1654,CHIMERA III,"With brow of light, as lovely as a pearl,"
1655,CHIMERA III,That was as beautiful as is the form
1656,CHIMERA III,Of sea-bird at the breaking of a storm.
1657,CHIMERA III,"The eye is open, with convulsive strain--"
1658,CHIMERA III,A most unfleshly orb! the stars that wane
1659,CHIMERA III,Have nothing of its hue; for it is cast
1660,CHIMERA III,"With sickly blood, and terribly aghast!"
1661,CHIMERA III,"And sunken in its socket, like the light"
1662,CHIMERA III,Of a red taper in the lonely night!
1663,CHIMERA III,And there is not a braid of her bright hair
1664,CHIMERA III,"But lieth floating in the moonlight air,"
1665,CHIMERA III,"Like the long moss, beside a silver spring,"
1666,CHIMERA III,"In elfin tresses, sadly murmuring."
1667,CHIMERA III,The worm hath 'gan to crawl upon her brow--
1668,CHIMERA III,"The living worm! and with a ripple now,"
1669,CHIMERA III,"Like that upon the sea, are heard below,"
1670,CHIMERA III,"The slimy swarms all ravening as they go,"
1671,CHIMERA III,"Amid the stagnate vitals, with a rush;"
1672,CHIMERA III,And one might hear them echoing the hush
1673,CHIMERA III,"Of Julio, as he watches by the side"
1674,CHIMERA III,"Of the dead ladye, his betrothed bride!"
1675,CHIMERA III,
1676,CHIMERA III,"And, ever and anon, a yellow group"
1677,CHIMERA III,"Was creeping on her bosom, like a troop"
1678,CHIMERA III,"Of stars, far up amid the galaxy,"
1679,CHIMERA III,"Pale, pale, as snowy showers; and two or three"
1680,CHIMERA III,"Were mocking the cold finger, round and round,"
1681,CHIMERA III,"With likeness of a ring; and, as they wound"
1682,CHIMERA III,"About its bony girth, they had the hue"
1683,CHIMERA III,Of pearly jewels glistering in dew.
1684,CHIMERA III,That deathly stare! it is an awful thing
1685,CHIMERA III,To gaze upon; and sickly thoughts will spring
1686,CHIMERA III,Before it to the heart: it telleth how
1687,CHIMERA III,There must be waste where there is beauty now.
1688,CHIMERA III,The chalk! the chalk! where was the virgin snow
1689,CHIMERA III,"Of that once heaving bosom!--even so,--"
1690,CHIMERA III,"The cold pale dewy chalk, with yellow shade"
1691,CHIMERA III,Amid the leprous hues; and o'er it played
1692,CHIMERA III,"The straggling moonlight, and the merry breeze,"
1693,CHIMERA III,"Like two fair elves, that, by the murmuring seas,"
1694,CHIMERA III,Woo'd smilingly together; but there fell
1695,CHIMERA III,"No life-gleam on the brow, all terrible"
1696,CHIMERA III,"Becoming, through its beauty, like a cloud"
1697,CHIMERA III,"That waneth paler even than a shroud,"
1698,CHIMERA III,All gorgeous and all glorious before;
1699,CHIMERA III,"For waste, like to the wanton night, was o'er"
1700,CHIMERA III,"Her virgin features, stealing them away--"
1701,CHIMERA III,Ah me! ah me! and this is Agathè?
1702,CHIMERA III,
1703,CHIMERA III,"""Enough! enough! Oh God! but I have pray'd"
1704,CHIMERA III,"To thee, in early daylight and in shade,"
1705,CHIMERA III,And the mad curse is on me still--and still!
1706,CHIMERA III,I cannot alter the Eternal will--
1707,CHIMERA III,"But--but--I hate thee, Agathè! I hate"
1708,CHIMERA III,What lunacy hath bade me consecrate:
1709,CHIMERA III,I am _not_ mad!--_not now!_--I do not feel
1710,CHIMERA III,That slumberous and blessed opiate steal
1711,CHIMERA III,"Up to my brain--Oh! that it only would,"
1712,CHIMERA III,To people this eternal solitude
1713,CHIMERA III,"With fancies, and fair dreams, and summer mirth,"
1714,CHIMERA III,"Which is not now--And yet, my mother earth,"
1715,CHIMERA III,"I would not love to lie above thee so,"
1716,CHIMERA III,As Agathè lies there--oh! no! no! no!
1717,CHIMERA III,To have these clay-worms feast upon my heart!
1718,CHIMERA III,"And all the light of being, to depart"
1719,CHIMERA III,Into a dismal shadow! I could die
1720,CHIMERA III,"As the red lightnings, quenching amid sky"
1721,CHIMERA III,"Their wild and wizard breath; I could away,"
1722,CHIMERA III,"Like a blue billow, bursting into spray;"
1723,CHIMERA III,"But, never--never have corruption here,"
1724,CHIMERA III,"To feed her worms, and let the sunlight jeer"
1725,CHIMERA III,"Above me so.--'Tis thou!--I owe thee, Moon,"
1726,CHIMERA III,To-night's fair worship; so be lifting soon
1727,CHIMERA III,"Thy veil of clouds, that I may kneel, as one"
1728,CHIMERA III,"That seeketh for thy virgin benison!"""
1729,CHIMERA III,
1730,CHIMERA III,"He gathers the cold limpets, as they creep"
1731,CHIMERA III,On the grey rocks beside the lonely deep;
1732,CHIMERA III,"And with a flint breaks through into the shell,"
1733,CHIMERA III,And feeds him--by the mass! he feasteth well.
1734,CHIMERA III,"And he hath lifted water in a clam,"
1735,CHIMERA III,"And tasted sweetly, from a stream that swam"
1736,CHIMERA III,"Down to the sea; and now is turn'd away,"
1737,CHIMERA III,"Again, again, to gaze on Agathè!"
1738,CHIMERA III,
1739,CHIMERA III,There is a cave upon that isle--a cave
1740,CHIMERA III,Where dwelt a hermit man; the winter wave
1741,CHIMERA III,"Roll'd to its entrance, casting a bright mound"
1742,CHIMERA III,Of snowy shells and fairy pebbles round;
1743,CHIMERA III,And over were the solemn ridges strewn
1744,CHIMERA III,"Of a dark rock, that, like the wizard throne"
1745,CHIMERA III,"Of some sea-monarch, stood, and from it hung"
1746,CHIMERA III,"Wild thorn and bramble, in confusion flung"
1747,CHIMERA III,"Amid the startling crevices--like sky,"
1748,CHIMERA III,"Through gloom of clouds, that sweep in thunder by."
1749,CHIMERA III,"A cataract fell over, in a streak"
1750,CHIMERA III,"Of silver, playing many a wanton freak;"
1751,CHIMERA III,"Midway, and musical, with elfin glee"
1752,CHIMERA III,"It bounded in its beauty to the sea,"
1753,CHIMERA III,Like dazzling angel vanishing away.
1754,CHIMERA III,"In sooth, 'twas pleasant in the moonlight gray"
1755,CHIMERA III,"To see that fairy fountain leaping so,"
1756,CHIMERA III,Like one that knew not wickedness nor woe!
1757,CHIMERA III,
1758,CHIMERA III,The hermit had his cross and rosary;
1759,CHIMERA III,"I ween like other hermits, so was he;"
1760,CHIMERA III,"A holy man, and frugal, and at night"
1761,CHIMERA III,"He prayed, or slept, or, sometimes, by the light"
1762,CHIMERA III,"Of the fair moon, went wandering beside"
1763,CHIMERA III,"The lonely sea, to hear the silver tide"
1764,CHIMERA III,Rolling in gleesome music to the shore:
1765,CHIMERA III,"The more he heard, he loved to hear the more."
1766,CHIMERA III,"And there he is, his hoary beard adrift"
1767,CHIMERA III,"To the night winds, that sportingly do lift"
1768,CHIMERA III,Its snow-white tresses; and he leaneth on
1769,CHIMERA III,"A rugged staff, all weakly and alone,"
1770,CHIMERA III,"A childless, friendless man!"
1771,CHIMERA III,
1772,CHIMERA III,He is beside
1773,CHIMERA III,"The ghastly Julio, and his ghastlier bride."
1774,CHIMERA III,'Twas wondrous strange to gaze upon the two!
1775,CHIMERA III,And the old hermit felt a throbbing through
1776,CHIMERA III,"His pulses:--""Holy virgin! save me, save!"""
1777,CHIMERA III,"He deem'd of spectre from the midnight wave,"
1778,CHIMERA III,"And cross'd him thrice, and pray'd, and pray'd again:--"
1779,CHIMERA III,"""Hence! hence!"" and Julio started, as the strain"
1780,CHIMERA III,Of exorcisms fell faintly on his ear:--
1781,CHIMERA III,"""I knew thee, father, that thou beest here,"
1782,CHIMERA III,"To gaze upon this girl, as I have been."
1783,CHIMERA III,By yonder moon! it was a frantic sin
1784,CHIMERA III,To worship so an image of the clay;
1785,CHIMERA III,It was like beauty--but is now away--
1786,CHIMERA III,"What lived upon her features, like the light"
1787,CHIMERA III,"On yonder cloud, all tender and all bright;"
1788,CHIMERA III,"But it is faded as the other must,"
1789,CHIMERA III,"And she that was all beauty, is all dust."""
1790,CHIMERA III,
1791,CHIMERA III,"""Father! thy hand upon this brow of mine,"
1792,CHIMERA III,"And tell me, is it cold?--But she will twine"
1793,CHIMERA III,"No wreath upon these temples,--never, never!"
1794,CHIMERA III,"For there she lieth, like a streamless river"
1795,CHIMERA III,"That stagnates in its bed. Feel, feel me, here,"
1796,CHIMERA III,If I be madly throbbing in the fear
1797,CHIMERA III,For that cold slimy worm. Ay! look and see
1798,CHIMERA III,"How dotingly it feeds, how pleasantly!"
1799,CHIMERA III,"And where it is, have been the living hues"
1800,CHIMERA III,"Of beauty, purer than the very dews."
1801,CHIMERA III,"So, father! seest thou that yonder moon"
1802,CHIMERA III,"Will be on wane to-morrow, soon and soon?"
1803,CHIMERA III,"And I, that feel my being wear away,"
1804,CHIMERA III,"Shall droop beside to darkness; so, but say"
1805,CHIMERA III,"A prayer for the dead, when I am gone,"
1806,CHIMERA III,And let the azure tide that floweth on
1807,CHIMERA III,Cover us lightly with its murmuring surf
1808,CHIMERA III,Like a green sward of melancholy turf.
1809,CHIMERA III,"Thou mayest, if thou wilt, thou mayest rear"
1810,CHIMERA III,"A cenotaph on this lone island here,"
1811,CHIMERA III,"Of some rude mossy stone, below a tree,"
1812,CHIMERA III,And carve an olden rhyme for her and me
1813,CHIMERA III,"Upon its brow."""
1814,CHIMERA III,
1815,CHIMERA III,"He bends, and gazes yet"
1816,CHIMERA III,Before his ghastly bride! the anchoret
1817,CHIMERA III,"Sate by him, and hath press'd a cross of wood"
1818,CHIMERA III,To his wan lips.
1819,CHIMERA III,
1820,CHIMERA III,*       *       *       *       *
1821,CHIMERA III,
1822,CHIMERA III,"""My son! look up and tell thy dismal tale."
1823,CHIMERA III,"Thou seemest cold, and sorrowful, and pale."
1824,CHIMERA III,Alas! I fear but thou hast strangely been
1825,CHIMERA III,"A child of curse, and misery, and sin."
1826,CHIMERA III,"And this--is she thy sister?""--""Nay! my bride."""
1827,CHIMERA III,"""A nun! and thou:""--""True, true! but then she died,"
1828,CHIMERA III,"And was a virgin, and is virgin still,"
1829,CHIMERA III,"Chaste as the moon, that taketh her pure fill"
1830,CHIMERA III,"Of light from the great sun. But now, go by,"
1831,CHIMERA III,"And leave me to my madness, or to die!"
1832,CHIMERA III,"This heart, this brain are sore.--Come, come, and fold"
1833,CHIMERA III,"Me round, ye hydra billows! wrapt in gold,"
1834,CHIMERA III,That are so writhing your eternal gyres
1835,CHIMERA III,"Before the moon, which, with a myriad tiars"
1836,CHIMERA III,"Is crowning you, as ye do fall and kiss"
1837,CHIMERA III,"Her pearly feet, that glide in blessedness!"
1838,CHIMERA III,"Let me be torture-eaten, ere I die!"
1839,CHIMERA III,Let me be mangled sore with agony!
1840,CHIMERA III,"And be so cursed, so stricken by the spell"
1841,CHIMERA III,"Of my heart's frenzy, that a living hell"
1842,CHIMERA III,Be burning there!--Back! back! if thou art mad--
1843,CHIMERA III,"Methought thou wast, but thou art only sad."
1844,CHIMERA III,"Is this thy child, old man? look, look, and see!"
1845,CHIMERA III,In truth it is a piteous thing for thee
1846,CHIMERA III,"To become childless--Well-a-well, go by!"
1847,CHIMERA III,"Is there no grave? The quiet sea is nigh,"
1848,CHIMERA III,And I will bury her below the moon;
1849,CHIMERA III,"It may be but a trance or midnight swoon,"
1850,CHIMERA III,"And she may wake. Wake, ladye! ha! methought"
1851,CHIMERA III,It was like _her_--Like her! and is it not?
1852,CHIMERA III,"My angel girl! my brain, my stricken brain!--"
1853,CHIMERA III,"I know thee now!--I know myself again."""
1854,CHIMERA III,
1855,CHIMERA III,"He flings him on the ladye, and anon,"
1856,CHIMERA III,"With loathly shudder, from that wither'd one"
1857,CHIMERA III,"Hath torn him back. ""Oh me! no more--no more!"
1858,CHIMERA III,"Thou virgin mother! Is the dream not o'er,"
1859,CHIMERA III,"That I have dreamt, but I must dream again"
1860,CHIMERA III,"For moons together, till this weary brain"
1861,CHIMERA III,Become distemper'd as the winter sea?
1862,CHIMERA III,Good father! give me blessing; let it be
1863,CHIMERA III,Upon me as the dew upon the moss.
1864,CHIMERA III,Oh me! but I have made the holy cross
1865,CHIMERA III,"A curse, and not a blessing! let me kiss"
1866,CHIMERA III,"The sacred symbol; for, by this--by this!"
1867,CHIMERA III,"I sware, and sware again, as now I will--"
1868,CHIMERA III,"Thou Heaven! if there be bounty in thee still,"
1869,CHIMERA III,"If thou wilt hear, and minister, and bring"
1870,CHIMERA III,The light of comfort on some angel wing
1871,CHIMERA III,"To one that lieth lone, do--do it now;"
1872,CHIMERA III,By all the stars that open on thy brow
1873,CHIMERA III,Like silver flowers! and by the herald moon
1874,CHIMERA III,"That listeth to be forth at nightly noon,"
1875,CHIMERA III,"Jousting the clouds, I swear! and be it true,"
1876,CHIMERA III,"As I have perjured me, that I renew"
1877,CHIMERA III,"Allegiance to thy God, and bind me o'er"
1878,CHIMERA III,"To this same penance, I have done before!"
1879,CHIMERA III,"That night and day I watch, as I have been"
1880,CHIMERA III,"Long watching, o'er the partner of my sin!"
1881,CHIMERA III,"That I taste never the delight of food,"
1882,CHIMERA III,"But these wild shell-fish, that may make the mood"
1883,CHIMERA III,"Of madness stronger, till it grapple Death--"
1884,CHIMERA III,"Despair--Eternity!"""
1885,CHIMERA III,
1886,CHIMERA III,"He saith, he saith,"
1887,CHIMERA III,"And, on the jaundiced bosom of the corse,"
1888,CHIMERA III,"Lieth all frenzied; one would see Remorse,"
1889,CHIMERA III,"And hopeless Love, and Hatred, struggling there,"
1890,CHIMERA III,"And Lunacy, that lightens up Despair,"
1891,CHIMERA III,And makes a gladness out of agony.
1892,CHIMERA III,"Pale phantom! I would fear and worship thee,"
1893,CHIMERA III,"That hast the soul at will, and gives it play,"
1894,CHIMERA III,Amid the wildest fancies far away;
1895,CHIMERA III,"That thronest Reason, on some wizard throne"
1896,CHIMERA III,"Of fairy land, within the milky zone,--"
1897,CHIMERA III,"Some spectre star, that glittereth beyond"
1898,CHIMERA III,The glorious galaxies of diamond.
1899,CHIMERA III,
1900,CHIMERA III,Beautiful Lunacy! that shapest flight
1901,CHIMERA III,"For love to blessed bowers of delight,"
1902,CHIMERA III,And buildest holy monarchies within
1903,CHIMERA III,"The fancy, till the very heart is queen"
1904,CHIMERA III,Of all her golden wishes. Lunacy!
1905,CHIMERA III,Thou empress of the passions! though they be
1906,CHIMERA III,"A sister group of wild, unearthly forms,"
1907,CHIMERA III,Like lightnings playing in their home of storms!
1908,CHIMERA III,"I see thee, striking at the silver strings"
1909,CHIMERA III,"Of the pure heart, and holy music springs"
1910,CHIMERA III,"Before thy touch, in many a solemn strain,"
1911,CHIMERA III,Like that of sea-waves rolling from the main!
1912,CHIMERA III,
1913,CHIMERA III,"But say, is Melancholy by thy side,"
1914,CHIMERA III,"With tresses in a raven shower, that hide"
1915,CHIMERA III,Her pale and weeping features? Is she never
1916,CHIMERA III,"Flowing before thee, like a gloomy river,"
1917,CHIMERA III,"The sister of thyself? but cold and chill,"
1918,CHIMERA III,"And winter-born, and sorrowfully still,"
1919,CHIMERA III,"And not like thee, that art in merry mood,"
1920,CHIMERA III,And frolicksome amid thy solitude!
1921,CHIMERA III,
1922,CHIMERA III,"Fair Lunacy! I see thee, with a crown"
1923,CHIMERA III,"Of hawthorn and sweet daisies, bending down"
1924,CHIMERA III,To mirror thy young image in a spring;
1925,CHIMERA III,And thou wilt kiss that shadow of a thing
1926,CHIMERA III,"As soul-less as thyself. 'Tis tender, too,"
1927,CHIMERA III,The smile that meeteth thine! the holy hue
1928,CHIMERA III,Of health! the pearly radiance of the brow!
1929,CHIMERA III,"All, all as tender--beautiful as thou!"
1930,CHIMERA III,
1931,CHIMERA III,"And wilt thou say, my sister, there is none"
1932,CHIMERA III,"Will answer thee? Thou art--thou art alone,"
1933,CHIMERA III,"A pure, pure being! but the God on high"
1934,CHIMERA III,"Is with thee ever, as thou goest by."
1935,CHIMERA III,
1936,CHIMERA III,"Thou poetess! that harpest to the moon,"
1937,CHIMERA III,"And, in soft concert to the silver tune"
1938,CHIMERA III,"Of waters, play'd on by the magic wind,"
1939,CHIMERA III,"As he comes streaming, with his hair untwined,"
1940,CHIMERA III,"Dost sing light strains of melody and mirth,--"
1941,CHIMERA III,"I hear thee, hymning on thy holy birth,"
1942,CHIMERA III,"How thou wert moulded of thy mother Love,"
1943,CHIMERA III,"That came, like seraph, from the stars above,"
1944,CHIMERA III,"And was so sadly wedded unto Sin,"
1945,CHIMERA III,"That thou wert born, and Sorrow was thy twin."
1946,CHIMERA III,Sorrow and mirthful Lunacy! that be
1947,CHIMERA III,"Together link'd for time, I deem of ye"
1948,CHIMERA III,"That ye are worshipp'd as none others are,--"
1949,CHIMERA III,"One as a lonely shadow, one a star!"
1950,CHIMERA III,
1951,CHIMERA III,"Is Julio glad, that bendeth, even now,"
1952,CHIMERA III,"To his wild purpose, to his holy vow?"
1953,CHIMERA III,He seeth only in his ladye-bride
1954,CHIMERA III,"The image of the laughing girl, that died"
1955,CHIMERA III,"A moon before--The same, the very same--"
1956,CHIMERA III,"The Agathè that lisp'd her lover's name,"
1957,CHIMERA III,"To him and to her heart: that azure eye,"
1958,CHIMERA III,"That shone through sunny tresses, waving by;"
1959,CHIMERA III,"The brow, the cheek, that blush'd of fire and snow,"
1960,CHIMERA III,Both blending into one ethereal glow;
1961,CHIMERA III,"And that same breathing radiancy, that swam"
1962,CHIMERA III,"Around her, like a pure and blessed calm"
1963,CHIMERA III,"Around some halcyon bird. And, as he kiss'd"
1964,CHIMERA III,"Her wormy lips, he felt that he was blest!"
1965,CHIMERA III,He felt her holy being stealing through
1966,CHIMERA III,"His own, like fountains of the azure dew,"
1967,CHIMERA III,That summer mingles with his golden light;
1968,CHIMERA III,"And he would clasp her, till the weary night"
1969,CHIMERA III,Was worn away.
1970,CHIMERA III,
1971,CHIMERA III,*       *       *       *       *
1972,CHIMERA III,
1973,CHIMERA III,And morning rose in form
1974,CHIMERA III,"Of heavy clouds, that knitted into storm"
1975,CHIMERA III,"The brow of Heaven, and through her lips the wind"
1976,CHIMERA III,"Came rolling westward, with a track behind"
1977,CHIMERA III,"Of gloomy billows, bursting on the sea,"
1978,CHIMERA III,"All rampant, like great lions terribly,"
1979,CHIMERA III,"And gnashing on each other: and anon,"
1980,CHIMERA III,"Julio heard them, rushing one by one,"
1981,CHIMERA III,"And laugh'd and turn'd.--The hermit was away,"
1982,CHIMERA III,"For he was old and weary, and he lay"
1983,CHIMERA III,"Within his cave, and thought it was a dream,"
1984,CHIMERA III,A summer's dream? and so the quiet stream
1985,CHIMERA III,"Of sleep came o'er his eyelids, and in truth"
1986,CHIMERA III,"He dreamt of that strange ladye, and the youth"
1987,CHIMERA III,That held a death-wake on her wasting form;
1988,CHIMERA III,"And so he slept and woke not, till the storm"
1989,CHIMERA III,Was over.
1990,CHIMERA III,
1991,CHIMERA III,"But they came,--the wind and sea,"
1992,CHIMERA III,"And rain and thunder, that in giant glee,"
1993,CHIMERA III,"Sang o'er the lightnings pale, as to and fro"
1994,CHIMERA III,"They writhed, like stricken angels!--White as snow"
1995,CHIMERA III,"Roll'd billow after billow, and the tide"
1996,CHIMERA III,"Came forward as an army deep and wide,"
1997,CHIMERA III,To charge with all its waters. There was heard
1998,CHIMERA III,"A murmur far and far, of those that stirr'd"
1999,CHIMERA III,"Within the great encampment of the sea,"
2000,CHIMERA III,"And dark they were, and lifted terribly"
2001,CHIMERA III,Their water-spouts like banners. It was grand
2002,CHIMERA III,"To see the black battalions, hand in hand"
2003,CHIMERA III,"Striding to conflict, and their helmets bent"
2004,CHIMERA III,Below their foamy plumes magnificent!
2005,CHIMERA III,
2006,CHIMERA III,"And Julio heard and laugh'd, ""Shall I be king"
2007,CHIMERA III,"To your great hosts, that ye are murmuring"
2008,CHIMERA III,For one to bear you to your holy war?
2009,CHIMERA III,"There is no sun, or moon, or any star,"
2010,CHIMERA III,To guide your iron footsteps as ye go;
2011,CHIMERA III,"But I, your king, will marshal you to flow"
2012,CHIMERA III,"From shore to shore. Then bring my car of shell,"
2013,CHIMERA III,That I may ride before you terrible;
2014,CHIMERA III,"And bring my sceptre of the amber weed,"
2015,CHIMERA III,"And Agathè, my virgin bride, shall lead"
2016,CHIMERA III,"Your summer hosts, when these are ambling low,"
2017,CHIMERA III,"In azure and in ermine, to and fro."""
2018,CHIMERA III,"He said, and madly, with his wasted hand,"
2019,CHIMERA III,"Swept o'er the tuneless harp, and fast he spann'd"
2020,CHIMERA III,"The silver chords, until a rush of sound"
2021,CHIMERA III,"Came from them, solemn--terrible--profound;"
2022,CHIMERA III,And then he dash'd the instrument away
2023,CHIMERA III,"Into the waters, and the giant play"
2024,CHIMERA III,"Of billows threw it back unto the shore,"
2025,CHIMERA III,"A shiver'd, stringless frame--its day of music o'er!"
2026,CHIMERA III,"The tide, the rolling tide! the multitude"
2027,CHIMERA III,"Of the sea surges, terrible and rude,"
2028,CHIMERA III,Tossing their chalky foam along the bed
2029,CHIMERA III,"Of thundering pebbles, that are shoring dread,"
2030,CHIMERA III,And fast retreating to the gloomy gorge
2031,CHIMERA III,"Of waters, sounding like a Titan forge!"
2032,CHIMERA III,
2033,CHIMERA III,"It comes! it comes! the tide, the rolling tide!"
2034,CHIMERA III,"But Julio is bending to his bride,"
2035,CHIMERA III,And making mirthful whispers to her ear.
2036,CHIMERA III,"A cataract! a cataract is near,"
2037,CHIMERA III,"Of one stupendous billow, and it breaks"
2038,CHIMERA III,"Terribly furious, with a myriad flakes"
2039,CHIMERA III,"Of foam, that fly about the haggard twain;"
2040,CHIMERA III,"And Julio started, with a sudden pain,"
2041,CHIMERA III,That shot into his heart; his reason flew
2042,CHIMERA III,"Back to its throne; he rose, and wildly threw"
2043,CHIMERA III,His matted tresses over on his brow.
2044,CHIMERA III,"Another billow came, and even now"
2045,CHIMERA III,Was dashing at his feet. There was no shade
2046,CHIMERA III,"Of terror, as the serpent waters play'd"
2047,CHIMERA III,"Before him, but his eye was calm as death."
2048,CHIMERA III,"Another, yet another! and the breath"
2049,CHIMERA III,Of the weird wind was with it; like a rock
2050,CHIMERA III,Unriveted it fell--a shroud of smoke
2051,CHIMERA III,"Pass'd over--there was heard, and died away,"
2052,CHIMERA III,"The voice of one, shrill shrieking, ""Agathè!"""
2053,CHIMERA III,
2054,CHIMERA III,The sea-bird sitteth lonely by the side
2055,CHIMERA III,"Of the far waste of waters, flapping wide"
2056,CHIMERA III,"His wet and weary wings; but _he_ is gone,"
2057,CHIMERA III,The stricken Julio!--a wave-swept stone
2058,CHIMERA III,"Stands there, on which he sat, and nakedly"
2059,CHIMERA III,It rises looking to the lonely sea;
2060,CHIMERA III,"But Julio is gone, and Agathè!"
2061,CHIMERA III,"The waters swept them madly to their core,--"
2062,CHIMERA III,The dead and living with a frantic roar!
2063,CHIMERA III,"And so he died, his bosom fondly set"
2064,CHIMERA III,On her's; and round her clay-cold waist were met
2065,CHIMERA III,"His bare and wither'd arms, and to her brow"
2066,CHIMERA III,"His lips were press'd. Both, both are perish'd now!"
2067,CHIMERA III,
2068,CHIMERA III,He died upon her bosom in a swoon;
2069,CHIMERA III,"And fancied of the pale and silver moon,"
2070,CHIMERA III,That went before him in her hall of blue:
2071,CHIMERA III,"He died like golden insect in the dew,"
2072,CHIMERA III,"Calm, calm, and pure; and not a chord was rung"
2073,CHIMERA III,"In his deep heart, but love. He perish'd young,"
2074,CHIMERA III,"But perish'd, wasted by some fatal flame"
2075,CHIMERA III,That fed upon his vitals; and there came
2076,CHIMERA III,"Lunacy sweeping lightly, like a stream,"
2077,CHIMERA III,Along his brain--He perish'd in a dream!
2078,CHIMERA III,
2079,CHIMERA III,"In sooth, I marvel not,"
2080,CHIMERA III,"If death be only a mysterious thought,"
2081,CHIMERA III,"That cometh on the heart, and turns the brow"
2082,CHIMERA III,"Brightless and chill, as Julio's is now;"
2083,CHIMERA III,For only had the wasting struggle been
2084,CHIMERA III,"Of one wild feeling, till it rose within"
2085,CHIMERA III,"Into the form of death, and nature felt"
2086,CHIMERA III,The light of the immortal being melt
2087,CHIMERA III,"Into its happier home, beyond the sea,"
2088,CHIMERA III,"And moon, and stars, into eternity!"
2089,CHIMERA III,
2090,CHIMERA III,The sun broke through his dungeon long enthrall'd
2091,CHIMERA III,"By dismal cloud, and on the emerald"
2092,CHIMERA III,"Of the great living sea was blazing down,"
2093,CHIMERA III,To gift the lordly billows with a crown
2094,CHIMERA III,Of diamond and silver. From his cave
2095,CHIMERA III,"The hermit came, and by the dying wave"
2096,CHIMERA III,"Lone wander'd, and he found upon the sand,"
2097,CHIMERA III,"Below a truss of sea-weed, with his hand"
2098,CHIMERA III,"Around the silent waist of Agathè,"
2099,CHIMERA III,"The corse of Julio! Pale, pale, it lay"
2100,CHIMERA III,Beside the wasted girl. The fireless eye
2101,CHIMERA III,"Was open, and a jewell'd rosary"
2102,CHIMERA III,"Hung round the neck; but it was gone,--the cross"
2103,CHIMERA III,That Agathè had given.
2104,CHIMERA III,
2105,CHIMERA III,"Amid the moss,"
2106,CHIMERA III,The hermit scoop'd a solitary grave
2107,CHIMERA III,"Below the pine-trees, and he sang a stave,"
2108,CHIMERA III,"Or two, or three, of some old requiem"
2109,CHIMERA III,As in their narrow home he buried them.
2110,CHIMERA III,"And many a day, before that blessed spot"
2111,CHIMERA III,"He sate, in lone and melancholy thought,"
2112,CHIMERA III,Gazing upon the grave; and one had guess'd
2113,CHIMERA III,Of some dark secret shadowing his breast.
2114,CHIMERA III,"And yet, to see him, with his silver hair"
2115,CHIMERA III,"Adrift and floating in the sea-borne air,"
2116,CHIMERA III,"And features chasten'd in the tears of woe,"
2117,CHIMERA III,In sooth 'twas merely sad to see him so!
2118,CHIMERA III,"A wreck of nature, floating far and fast,"
2119,CHIMERA III,Upon the stream of Time--to sink at last!
2120,CHIMERA III,
2121,CHIMERA III,"And he is wandering by the shore again,"
2122,CHIMERA III,Hard leaning on his staff; the azure main
2123,CHIMERA III,"Lies sleeping far before him, with his seas"
2124,CHIMERA III,"Fast folded in the bosom of the breeze,"
2125,CHIMERA III,That like the angel Peace hath dropt his wings
2126,CHIMERA III,Around the warring waters. Sadly sings
2127,CHIMERA III,"To his own heart that lonely hermit man,"
2128,CHIMERA III,"A tale of other days, when passion ran"
2129,CHIMERA III,"Along his pulses, like a troubled stream,"
2130,CHIMERA III,"And glory was a splendour, and a dream!"
2131,CHIMERA III,"He stoop'd to gather up a shining gem,"
2132,CHIMERA III,"That lay amid the shells, as bright as them,--"
2133,CHIMERA III,"It was a cross, the cross that Agathè"
2134,CHIMERA III,Had given to her Julio: the play
2135,CHIMERA III,"Of the fierce sunbeams fell upon its face,"
2136,CHIMERA III,And on the glistering jewels--But the trace
2137,CHIMERA III,Of some old thought came burning to the brain
2138,CHIMERA III,"Of the pale hermit, and he shrunk in pain"
2139,CHIMERA III,Before the holy symbol. It was not
2140,CHIMERA III,Because of the eternal ransom wrought
2141,CHIMERA III,"In ages far away, or he had bent"
2142,CHIMERA III,In pure devotion sad and reverent;
2143,CHIMERA III,"But now, he started, as he look'd upon"
2144,CHIMERA III,"That jewell'd thing, and wildly he is gone"
2145,CHIMERA III,"Back to the mossy grave, away, away:--"
2146,CHIMERA III,"""My child! my child! my own, own Agathè!"""
2147,CHIMERA III,
2148,CHIMERA III,"It is her father,--he,--an alter'd man!"
2149,CHIMERA III,"His quiet had been wounded, and the ban"
2150,CHIMERA III,"Of misery came over him, and froze"
2151,CHIMERA III,"The bright and holy tides, that fell and rose"
2152,CHIMERA III,"In joy amid his heart. To think of her,"
2153,CHIMERA III,"That he had injured so, and all so fair,"
2154,CHIMERA III,"So fond, so like the chosen of his youth,--"
2155,CHIMERA III,"It was a very dismal thought, in truth,"
2156,CHIMERA III,"That he had left her hopelessly, for aye,"
2157,CHIMERA III,"Within the cloister-wall to droop, and die!"
2158,CHIMERA III,And so he could not bear to have it be;
2159,CHIMERA III,"But sought for some lone island in the sea,"
2160,CHIMERA III,"Where he might dwell in doleful solitude,"
2161,CHIMERA III,"And do strange penance in his mirthless mood,"
2162,CHIMERA III,"For this same crime, unnaturally wild,"
2163,CHIMERA III,That he had done unto his saintly child.
2164,CHIMERA III,"And ever he did think, when he had laid"
2165,CHIMERA III,"These lovers in the grave, that, through the shade"
2166,CHIMERA III,"Of ghastly features melting to decay,"
2167,CHIMERA III,He saw the image of his Agathè.
2168,CHIMERA III,
2169,CHIMERA III,And now the truth had flash'd into his brain:
2170,CHIMERA III,"And he is fallen, with a shriek of pain,"
2171,CHIMERA III,Upon the lap of pale and yellow moss;
2172,CHIMERA III,For long ago he gave that blessed cross
2173,CHIMERA III,"To his fair girl, and knew the relic still,"
2174,CHIMERA III,"By many a thousand thoughts, that rose at will"
2175,CHIMERA III,"Before it, of the one that was not now,"
2176,CHIMERA III,"But, like a dream, had floated from the brow"
2177,CHIMERA III,"Of Time, that seeth many a lovely thing"
2178,CHIMERA III,"Fade by him, like a sea-wave murmuring."
2179,CHIMERA III,
2180,CHIMERA III,The heart is burst!--the heart that stood in steel
2181,CHIMERA III,"To woman's earnest tears, and bade her feel"
2182,CHIMERA III,"The curse of virgin solitude,--a veil;"
2183,CHIMERA III,And saw the gladsome features growing pale
2184,CHIMERA III,"Unmoved: 'tis rent, like some eternal tower"
2185,CHIMERA III,"The sea hath shaken, and its stately power"
2186,CHIMERA III,"Lies lonely, fallen, scatter'd on the shore:"
2187,CHIMERA III,"'Tis rent, like some great mountain, that, before"
2188,CHIMERA III,"The Deluge, stood in glory and in might,"
2189,CHIMERA III,"But now is lightning-riven, and the night"
2190,CHIMERA III,"Is clambering up its sides, and chasms lie strewn,"
2191,CHIMERA III,"Like coffins, here and there: 'tis rent! the throne"
2192,CHIMERA III,"Where passions, in their awful anarchy,"
2193,CHIMERA III,"Stood sceptred! There was heard an inward sigh,"
2194,CHIMERA III,"That took the being, on its troubled wings,"
2195,CHIMERA III,Far to the land of dim imaginings!
2196,CHIMERA III,
2197,CHIMERA III,All three are dead; that desolate green isle
2198,CHIMERA III,Is only peopled by the passing smile
2199,CHIMERA III,"Of sun and moon, that surely have a sense,"
2200,CHIMERA III,"They look so radiant with intelligence,--"
2201,CHIMERA III,"So like the soul's own element,--so fair!"
2202,CHIMERA III,The features of a God lie veiled there!
2203,CHIMERA III,
2204,CHIMERA III,And mariners that have been toiling far
2205,CHIMERA III,"Upon the deep, and lost the polar star,"
2206,CHIMERA III,"Have visited that island, and have seen"
2207,CHIMERA III,That lover's grave: and many there have been
2208,CHIMERA III,"That sat upon the gray and crumbling stone,"
2209,CHIMERA III,"And started, as they saw a skeleton"
2210,CHIMERA III,"Amid the long sad moss, that fondly grew"
2211,CHIMERA III,Through the white wasted ribs; but never knew
2212,CHIMERA III,"Of those who slept below, or of the tale"
2213,CHIMERA III,"Of that brain-stricken man, that felt the pale"
2214,CHIMERA III,"And wandering moonlight steal his soul away,--"
2215,CHIMERA III,"Poor Julio, and the ladye Agathè!"
2216,CHIMERA III,
2217,CHIMERA III,*       *       *       *       *
2218,CHIMERA III,
2219,CHIMERA III,"We found them,--children of toil and tears,"
2220,CHIMERA III,Their birth of beauty shaded;
2221,CHIMERA III,We left them in their early years
2222,CHIMERA III,Fallen and faded.
2223,CHIMERA III,
2224,CHIMERA III,"We found them, flowers of summer hue:"
2225,CHIMERA III,Their golden cups were lighted
2226,CHIMERA III,With sparkles of the pearly dew--
2227,CHIMERA III,We left them blighted!
2228,CHIMERA III,
2229,CHIMERA III,"We found them,--like those fairy flowers;"
2230,CHIMERA III,And the light of morn lay holy
2231,CHIMERA III,Over their sad and sainted bowers--
2232,CHIMERA III,"We left them, lowly."
2233,CHIMERA III,
2234,CHIMERA III,"We found them,--like twin stars, alone,"
2235,CHIMERA III,In brightness and in feeling;
2236,CHIMERA III,"We left them,--and the curse was on"
2237,CHIMERA III,Their beauty stealing.
2238,CHIMERA III,
2239,CHIMERA III,"They rest in quiet, where they are:"
2240,CHIMERA III,Their lifetime is the story
2241,CHIMERA III,"Of some fair flower--some silver star,"
2242,CHIMERA III,Faded in glory!

2384,"HER, A STATUE",How beautiful!--The very lips do speak
2385,"HER, A STATUE","Of love, and bid us worship: the pale cheek"
2386,"HER, A STATUE",Seems blushing through the marble--through the snow!
2387,"HER, A STATUE",And the undrap'ried bosom feels a flow
2388,"HER, A STATUE",Of fever on its brightness; every vein
2389,"HER, A STATUE","At the blue pulse swells softly, like a chain"
2390,"HER, A STATUE",Of gentle hills. I would not fling a wreath
2391,"HER, A STATUE","Of jewels on that brow, to flash beneath"
2392,"HER, A STATUE",Those queenly tresses; for itself is more
2393,"HER, A STATUE",Than sea-born pearl of some Elysian shore!
2394,"HER, A STATUE",
2395,"HER, A STATUE","Such, with a heart like woman! I would cast"
2396,"HER, A STATUE","Life at her foot, and, as she glided past,"
2397,"HER, A STATUE",Would bid her trample on the slavish thing--
2398,"HER, A STATUE","Tell her, I'd rather feel me withering"
2399,"HER, A STATUE","Under her step, than be unknown for aye:"
2400,"HER, A STATUE","And, when her pride had crush'd me, she might see"
2401,"HER, A STATUE",A love-wing'd spirit glide in glory by
2402,"HER, A STATUE",Striking the tent of its mortality!

2434,THE WOLF-DROVE,
2435,THE WOLF-DROVE,
2436,THE WOLF-DROVE,No night-star in the welkin blue! no moonshade round the trees
2437,THE WOLF-DROVE,That grew down to the sea-swept foot of the ancient Pyrenees!
2438,THE WOLF-DROVE,"The cold gray mantle of the mist, along the shoulders cast"
2439,THE WOLF-DROVE,"Of those wild mountains, to and fro, hung waving in the blast."
2440,THE WOLF-DROVE,
2441,THE WOLF-DROVE,"A snow-crown rising on their brows, in royalty they stood,"
2442,THE WOLF-DROVE,As if they vice-reign'd on a throne of winter solitude;
2443,THE WOLF-DROVE,"Those hills that rose far upward, till in majesty they bent"
2444,THE WOLF-DROVE,Their world's great eye-orb on her own immortal lineament!
2445,THE WOLF-DROVE,
2446,THE WOLF-DROVE,"The howl, the long deep howl was heard, the rushing like a wave"
2447,THE WOLF-DROVE,"Of the wolf train from their forest haunt, in some old mountain cave;"
2448,THE WOLF-DROVE,"Like a sea-wave, when the wind is horsed behind its foamy crest,"
2449,THE WOLF-DROVE,"And it lifts upon the shell-built shore, its azure-spotted breast."
2450,THE WOLF-DROVE,
2451,THE WOLF-DROVE,"They came with war-whoop, following each other, like a thread,"
2452,THE WOLF-DROVE,"Through the long labyrinth of trees, in sunless archway spread;"
2453,THE WOLF-DROVE,"Their gnarled trunks in shadowy lines rose dimly, few by few,"
2454,THE WOLF-DROVE,"Mail'd in their mossy armouring,--a pathless avenue!"
2455,THE WOLF-DROVE,
2456,THE WOLF-DROVE,"In sooth, there was a shepherd girl by her aged father's side;"
2457,THE WOLF-DROVE,"He gazed upon her deep dark eyes, in glory and in pride;"
2458,THE WOLF-DROVE,"The mother's soul was living there,--the image full and wild,"
2459,THE WOLF-DROVE,"Of one he loved--of one no more, was beaming in her child."
2460,THE WOLF-DROVE,
2461,THE WOLF-DROVE,"And she was at her father's side, her raven tresses felt"
2462,THE WOLF-DROVE,"Upon his care-worn cheek, as gay and joyfully she knelt,"
2463,THE WOLF-DROVE,"Kissing the old man's tears away, by the embers burning faint,"
2464,THE WOLF-DROVE,"While she sung the holy aves, and a vesper to her saint."
2465,THE WOLF-DROVE,
2466,THE WOLF-DROVE,"""Now bar the breezy lattice, love!--but hist! how fares the night?"
2467,THE WOLF-DROVE,Methought I heard the wolf abroad. Heaven help! I heard aright--
2468,THE WOLF-DROVE,My mantle!--By the Mother Saint! our flock is in the fold?
2469,THE WOLF-DROVE,"How think you, love? wake up the hound, I ween the wolf is bold."""
2470,THE WOLF-DROVE,
2471,THE WOLF-DROVE,"""Stay, stay; 'tis past!"" ""I hear it still; to rest, I pray, to rest."""
2472,THE WOLF-DROVE,"""Nay, father! hold; thou must not go;"" and silently she press'd"
2473,THE WOLF-DROVE,"The old man's arm, and bade him stay, for love of Heaven and her:"
2474,THE WOLF-DROVE,"His danger was too wild a thought, for so fond a girl to bear."
2475,THE WOLF-DROVE,
2476,THE WOLF-DROVE,"He kiss'd her, and they parted then; but, through the lattice low,"
2477,THE WOLF-DROVE,"She gazed amid the vine-twigs pale, all cradled to and fro;"
2478,THE WOLF-DROVE,"The holy whisper of the wind stole lightly by the eaves,--"
2479,THE WOLF-DROVE,"A sad dirge, sighing to the fall of the winter-blighted leaves."
2480,THE WOLF-DROVE,
2481,THE WOLF-DROVE,"He comes not! 'Tis a dreadful thing to hear them as they rave,"
2482,THE WOLF-DROVE,"The savage wolf-train howling, like the near burst of a wave."
2483,THE WOLF-DROVE,She thought it was a father's cry she heard--a father's cry!
2484,THE WOLF-DROVE,"And she flung her from the cottage door, in startled agony."
2485,THE WOLF-DROVE,
2486,THE WOLF-DROVE,"Good Virgin save thee, gentle girl! they are no knightly train"
2487,THE WOLF-DROVE,That mark thee for their sinless prey--thou wilt not smile again;
2488,THE WOLF-DROVE,The blood is streaming on thy cheek; the heart it ceases slow;
2489,THE WOLF-DROVE,A father gazes on his child--God help a father's woe!
