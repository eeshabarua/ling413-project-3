65,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,
66,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,
67,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,Adieu to Belashanny!
68,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,where I was bred and born;
69,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"Go where I may, I'll think of you,"
70,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,as sure as night and morn.
71,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"The kindly spot, the friendly town,"
72,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"where every one is known,"
73,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,And not a face in all the place
74,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,but partly seems my own;
75,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"There's not a house or window,"
76,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"there's not a field or hill,"
77,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"But, east or west, in foreign lands,"
78,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,I'll recollect them still.
79,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"I leave my warm heart with you,"
80,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,tho' my back I'm forced to turn--
81,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"Adieu to Belashanny,"
82,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,and the winding banks of Erne!
83,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,
84,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,No more on pleasant evenings
85,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"we'll saunter down the Mall,"
86,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"When the trout is rising to the fly,"
87,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,the salmon to the fall.
88,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"The boat comes straining on her net,"
89,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"and heavily she creeps,"
90,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"Cast off, cast off--she feels the oars,"
91,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,and to her berth she sweeps;
92,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"Now fore and aft keep hauling,"
93,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"and gathering up the clew,"
94,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,Till a silver wave of salmon
95,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,rolls in among the crew.
96,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"Then they may sit, with pipes a-lit,"
97,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,and many a joke and 'yarn';--
98,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"Adieu to Belashanny,"
99,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,and the winding banks of Erne!
100,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,
101,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"The music of the waterfall,"
102,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"the mirror of the tide,"
103,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,When all the green-hill'd harbour
104,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"is full from side to side,"
105,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"From Portnasun to Bulliebawns,"
106,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"and round the Abbey Bay,"
107,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,From rocky Inis Saimer
108,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,to Coolnargit sandhills gray;
109,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"While far upon the southern line,"
110,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"to guard it like a wall,"
111,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,The Leitrim mountains clothed in blue
112,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"gaze calmly over all,"
113,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"And watch the ship sail up or down,"
114,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,the red flag at her stern;--
115,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"Adieu to these, adieu to all"
116,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,the winding banks of Erne!
117,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,
118,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"Farewell to you, Kildoney lads,"
119,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"and them that pull an oar,"
120,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"A lug-sail set, or haul a net,"
121,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,from the Point to Mullaghmore;
122,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"From Killybegs to bold Slieve-League,"
123,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"that ocean-mountain steep,"
124,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"Six hundred yards in air aloft,"
125,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"six hundred in the deep,"
126,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"From Dooran to the Fairy Bridge,"
127,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"and round by Tullen strand,"
128,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"Level and long, and white with waves,"
129,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,where gull and curlew stand;
130,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,Head out to sea when on your lee
131,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,the breakers you discern!--
132,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"Adieu to all the billowy coast,"
133,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,and winding banks of Erne!
134,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,
135,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"Farewell, Coolmore,--Bundoran! and"
136,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,your summer crowds that run
137,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,From inland homes to see with joy
138,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,th' Atlantic-setting sun;
139,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"To breathe the buoyant salted air,"
140,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,and sport among the waves;
141,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"To gather shells on sandy beach,"
142,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,and tempt the gloomy caves;
143,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"To watch the flowing, ebbing tide,"
144,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"the boats, the crabs, the fish;"
145,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"Young men and maids to meet and smile,"
146,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,and form a tender wish;
147,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"The sick and old in search of health,"
148,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,for all things have their turn--
149,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"And I must quit my native shore,"
150,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,and the winding banks of Erne!
151,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,
152,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,Farewell to every white cascade
153,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"from the Harbour to Belleek,"
154,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"And every pool where fins may rest,"
155,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,and ivy-shaded creek;
156,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"The sloping fields, the lofty rocks,"
157,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"where ash and holly grow,"
158,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,The one split yew-tree gazing
159,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,on the curving flood below;
160,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"The Lough, that winds through islands"
161,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,under Turaw mountain green;
162,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"And Castle Caldwell's stretching woods,"
163,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,with tranquil bays between;
164,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"And Breesie Hill, and many a pond"
165,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"among the heath and fern,--"
166,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,For I must say adieu--adieu
167,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,to the winding banks of Erne!
168,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,
169,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,The thrush will call through Camlin groves
170,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,the live-long summer day;
171,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"The waters run by mossy cliff,"
172,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,and banks with wild flowers gay;
173,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,The girls will bring their work and sing
174,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"beneath a twisted thorn,"
175,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,Or stray with sweethearts down the path
176,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,among the growing corn;
177,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"Along the river-side they go,"
178,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"where I have often been,"
179,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"Oh, never shall I see again"
180,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,the happy days I've seen!
181,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,A thousand chances are to one
182,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"I never may return,--"
183,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"Adieu to Belashanny,"
184,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,and the winding banks of Erne!
185,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,
186,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"Adieu to evening dances,"
187,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"when merry neighbours meet,"
188,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"And the fiddle says to boys and girls,"
189,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,'Get up and shake your feet!'
190,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,To 'seanachas' and wise old talk
191,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,of Erin's days gone by--
192,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"Who trench'd the rath on such a hill,"
193,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,and where the bones may lie
194,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"Of saint, or king, or warrior chief;"
195,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"with tales of fairy power,"
196,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,And tender ditties sweetly sung
197,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,to pass the twilight hour.
198,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,The mournful song of exile
199,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,is now for me to learn--
200,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"Adieu, my dear companions"
201,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,on the winding banks of Erne!
202,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,
203,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,Now measure from the Commons down
204,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"to each end of the Purt,"
205,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"Round the Abbey, Moy, and Knather,--"
206,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,I wish no one any hurt;
207,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"The Main Street, Back Street, College Lane,"
208,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"the Mall, and Portnasun,"
209,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"If any foes of mine are there,"
210,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,I pardon every one.
211,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,I hope that man and womankind
212,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,will do the same by me;
213,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,For my heart is sore and heavy
214,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,at voyaging the sea.
215,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"My loving friends I'll bear in mind,"
216,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,and often fondly turn
217,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"To think of Belashanny,"
218,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,and the winding banks of Erne.
219,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,
220,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"If ever I'm a money'd man,"
221,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"I mean, please God, to cast"
222,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,My golden anchor in the place
223,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,where youthful years were pass'd;
224,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,Though heads that now are black and brown
225,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"must meanwhile gather gray,"
226,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"New faces rise by every hearth,"
227,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,and old ones drop away--
228,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,Yet dearer still that Irish hill
229,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,than all the world beside;
230,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"It's home, sweet home, where'er I roam"
231,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,through lands and waters wide.
232,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"And if the Lord allows me,"
233,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,I surely will return
234,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,"To my native Belashanny,"
235,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,and the winding banks of Erne.
236,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,
237,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,
238,THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE,

240,ABBEY ASAROE,ABBEY ASAROE
241,ABBEY ASAROE,
242,ABBEY ASAROE,
243,ABBEY ASAROE,"Gray, gray is Abbey Asaroe,"
244,ABBEY ASAROE,"by Belashanny town,"
245,ABBEY ASAROE,"It has neither door nor window,"
246,ABBEY ASAROE,the walls are broken down;
247,ABBEY ASAROE,The carven-stones lie scatter'd
248,ABBEY ASAROE,in briar and nettle-bed;
249,ABBEY ASAROE,The only feet are those that come
250,ABBEY ASAROE,at burial of the dead.
251,ABBEY ASAROE,A little rocky rivulet
252,ABBEY ASAROE,"runs murmuring to the tide,"
253,ABBEY ASAROE,"Singing a song of ancient days,"
254,ABBEY ASAROE,"in sorrow, not in pride;"
255,ABBEY ASAROE,The boortree and the lightsome ash
256,ABBEY ASAROE,"across the portal grow,"
257,ABBEY ASAROE,And heaven itself is now the roof
258,ABBEY ASAROE,of Abbey Asaroe.
259,ABBEY ASAROE,
260,ABBEY ASAROE,It looks beyond the harbour-stream
261,ABBEY ASAROE,to Gulban mountain blue;
262,ABBEY ASAROE,"It hears the voice of Erna's fall,--"
263,ABBEY ASAROE,Atlantic breakers too;
264,ABBEY ASAROE,High ships go sailing past it;
265,ABBEY ASAROE,the sturdy clank of oars
266,ABBEY ASAROE,Brings in the salmon-boat to haul
267,ABBEY ASAROE,a net upon the shores;
268,ABBEY ASAROE,"And this way to his home-creek,"
269,ABBEY ASAROE,"when the summer day is done,"
270,ABBEY ASAROE,Slow sculls the weary fisherman
271,ABBEY ASAROE,across the setting sun;
272,ABBEY ASAROE,"While green with corn is Sheegus Hill,"
273,ABBEY ASAROE,his cottage white below;
274,ABBEY ASAROE,But gray at every season
275,ABBEY ASAROE,is Abbey Asaroe.
276,ABBEY ASAROE,
277,ABBEY ASAROE,There stood one day a poor old man
278,ABBEY ASAROE,above its broken bridge;
279,ABBEY ASAROE,"He heard no running rivulet,"
280,ABBEY ASAROE,he saw no mountain-ridge;
281,ABBEY ASAROE,"He turn'd his back on Sheegus Hill,"
282,ABBEY ASAROE,and view'd with misty sight
283,ABBEY ASAROE,"The Abbey walls, the burial-ground"
284,ABBEY ASAROE,with crosses ghostly white;
285,ABBEY ASAROE,Under a weary weight of years
286,ABBEY ASAROE,"he bow'd upon his staff,"
287,ABBEY ASAROE,Perusing in the present time
288,ABBEY ASAROE,the former's epitaph;
289,ABBEY ASAROE,"For, gray and wasted like the walls,"
290,ABBEY ASAROE,"a figure full of woe,"
291,ABBEY ASAROE,This man was of the blood of them
292,ABBEY ASAROE,who founded Asaroe.
293,ABBEY ASAROE,
294,ABBEY ASAROE,"From Derry to Bundrowas Tower,"
295,ABBEY ASAROE,Tirconnell broad was theirs;
296,ABBEY ASAROE,"Spearmen and plunder, bards and wine,"
297,ABBEY ASAROE,and holy abbot's prayers;
298,ABBEY ASAROE,With chanting always in the house
299,ABBEY ASAROE,which they had builded high
300,ABBEY ASAROE,"To God and to Saint Bernard,--"
301,ABBEY ASAROE,where at last they came to die.
302,ABBEY ASAROE,"At worst, no workhouse grave for him!"
303,ABBEY ASAROE,the ruins of his race
304,ABBEY ASAROE,Shall rest among the ruin'd stones
305,ABBEY ASAROE,of this their saintly place.
306,ABBEY ASAROE,The fond old man was weeping;
307,ABBEY ASAROE,and tremulous and slow
308,ABBEY ASAROE,Along the rough and crooked lane
309,ABBEY ASAROE,he crept from Asaroe.
310,ABBEY ASAROE,
311,ABBEY ASAROE,
312,ABBEY ASAROE,
313,ABBEY ASAROE,
314,A DREAM,A DREAM
315,A DREAM,
316,A DREAM,
317,A DREAM,I heard the dogs howl in the moonlight night;
318,A DREAM,I went to the window to see the sight;
319,A DREAM,All the Dead that ever I knew
320,A DREAM,Going one by one and two by two.
321,A DREAM,
322,A DREAM,"On they pass'd, and on they pass'd;"
323,A DREAM,"Townsfellows all, from first to last;"
324,A DREAM,"Born in the moonlight of the lane,"
325,A DREAM,Quench'd in the heavy shadow again.
326,A DREAM,
327,A DREAM,"Schoolmates, marching as when we play'd"
328,A DREAM,At soldiers once--but now more staid;
329,A DREAM,Those were the strangest sight to me
330,A DREAM,"Who were drown'd, I knew, in the awful sea."
331,A DREAM,
332,A DREAM,"Straight and handsome folk; bent and weak, too;"
333,A DREAM,"Some that I loved, and gasp'd to speak to;"
334,A DREAM,Some but a day in their churchyard bed;
335,A DREAM,Some that I had not known were dead.
336,A DREAM,
337,A DREAM,"A long, long crowd--where each seem'd lonely,"
338,A DREAM,"Yet of them all there was one, one only,"
339,A DREAM,Raised a head or look'd my way:
340,A DREAM,She linger'd a moment--she might not stay.
341,A DREAM,
342,A DREAM,How long since I saw that fair pale face!
343,A DREAM,Ah! Mother dear! might I only place
344,A DREAM,"My head on thy breast, a moment to rest,"
345,A DREAM,While thy hand on my tearful cheek were prest!
346,A DREAM,
347,A DREAM,"On, on, a moving bridge they made"
348,A DREAM,"Across the moon-stream, from shade to shade,"
349,A DREAM,"Young and old, women and men;"
350,A DREAM,"Many long-forgot, but remember'd then."
351,A DREAM,
352,A DREAM,And first there came a bitter laughter;
353,A DREAM,A sound of tears the moment after;
354,A DREAM,"And then a music so lofty and gay,"
355,A DREAM,"That every morning, day by day,"
356,A DREAM,I strive to recall it if I may.
357,A DREAM,
358,A DREAM,

361,THE FAIRIES,THE FAIRIES
362,THE FAIRIES,
363,THE FAIRIES,
364,THE FAIRIES,"Up the airy mountain,"
365,THE FAIRIES,"Down the rushy glen,"
366,THE FAIRIES,We daren't go a-hunting
367,THE FAIRIES,For fear of little men;
368,THE FAIRIES,"Wee folk, good folk,"
369,THE FAIRIES,Trooping all together;
370,THE FAIRIES,"Green jacket, red cap,"
371,THE FAIRIES,And white owl's feather!
372,THE FAIRIES,Down along the rocky shore
373,THE FAIRIES,"Some make their home,"
374,THE FAIRIES,They live on crispy pancakes
375,THE FAIRIES,Of yellow tide-foam;
376,THE FAIRIES,Some in the reeds
377,THE FAIRIES,"Of the black mountain lake,"
378,THE FAIRIES,"With frogs for their watch-dogs,"
379,THE FAIRIES,All night awake.
380,THE FAIRIES,
381,THE FAIRIES,High on the hill-top
382,THE FAIRIES,The old King sits;
383,THE FAIRIES,He is now so old and gray
384,THE FAIRIES,He's nigh lost his wits.
385,THE FAIRIES,With a bridge of white mist
386,THE FAIRIES,"Columbkill he crosses,"
387,THE FAIRIES,On his stately journeys
388,THE FAIRIES,From Slieveleague to Rosses;
389,THE FAIRIES,Or going up with music
390,THE FAIRIES,"On cold starry nights,"
391,THE FAIRIES,To sup with the Queen
392,THE FAIRIES,Of the gay Northern Lights.
393,THE FAIRIES,
394,THE FAIRIES,They stole little Bridget
395,THE FAIRIES,For seven years long;
396,THE FAIRIES,When she came down again
397,THE FAIRIES,Her friends were all gone.
398,THE FAIRIES,"They took her lightly back,"
399,THE FAIRIES,"Between the night and morrow,"
400,THE FAIRIES,"They thought that she was fast asleep,"
401,THE FAIRIES,But she was dead with sorrow.
402,THE FAIRIES,They have kept her ever since
403,THE FAIRIES,"Deep within the lake,"
404,THE FAIRIES,"On a bed of flag-leaves,"
405,THE FAIRIES,Watching till she wake.
406,THE FAIRIES,
407,THE FAIRIES,"By the craggy hill-side,"
408,THE FAIRIES,"Through the mosses bare,"
409,THE FAIRIES,They have planted thorn-trees
410,THE FAIRIES,For pleasure here and there.
411,THE FAIRIES,Is any man so daring
412,THE FAIRIES,"As dig them up in spite,"
413,THE FAIRIES,He shall find their sharpest thorns
414,THE FAIRIES,In his bed at night.
415,THE FAIRIES,
416,THE FAIRIES,"Up the airy mountain,"
417,THE FAIRIES,"Down the rushy glen,"
418,THE FAIRIES,We daren't go a-hunting
419,THE FAIRIES,For fear of little men;
420,THE FAIRIES,"Wee folk, good folk,"

432,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,Up on the lonely rath's green mound?
433,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,Only the plaintive yellow bird
434,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"Sighing in sultry fields around,"
435,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"Chary, chary, chary, chee-ee!--"
436,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,Only the grasshopper and the bee?--
437,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"'Tip-tap, rip-rap,"
438,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,Tick-a-tack-too!
439,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"Scarlet leather, sewn together,"
440,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,This will make a shoe.
441,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"Left, right, pull it tight;"
442,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,Summer days are warm;
443,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"Underground in winter,"
444,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,Laughing at the storm!'
445,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,Lay your ear close to the hill.
446,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"Do you not catch the tiny clamour,"
447,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"Busy click of an elfin hammer,"
448,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,Voice of the Lepracaun singing shrill
449,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,As he merrily plies his trade?
450,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,He's a span
451,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,And a quarter in height.
452,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"Get him in sight, hold him tight,"
453,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,And you're a made
454,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,Man!
455,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,
456,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"You watch your cattle the summer day,"
457,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"Sup on potatoes, sleep in the hay;"
458,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"How would you like to roll in your carriage,"
459,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,Look for a duchess's daughter in marriage?
460,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,Seize the Shoemaker--then you may!
461,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"'Big boots a-hunting,"
462,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"Sandals in the hall,"
463,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"White for a wedding-feast,"
464,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,Pink for a ball.
465,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"This way, that way,"
466,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,So we make a shoe;

475,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,Guarded by him;

478,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,With gold!
479,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,
480,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"I caught him at work one day, myself,"
481,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"In the castle-ditch where foxglove grows,--"
482,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"A wrinkled, wizen'd, and bearded Elf,"
483,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"Spectacles stuck on his pointed nose,"
484,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"Silver buckles to his hose,"

493,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,When the job is done!'
494,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"The rogue was mine, beyond a doubt."
495,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,I stared at him; he stared at me;
496,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"'Servant, Sir!' 'Humph!' says he,"
497,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,And pull'd a snuff-box out.
498,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"He took a long pinch, look'd better pleased,"
499,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,The queer little Lepracaun;
500,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"Offer'd the box with a whimsical grace,--"
501,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"Pouf! he flung the dust in my face,"
502,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,"And while I sneezed,"
503,THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER,Was gone!

509,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,
510,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,
511,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,With grief and mourning I sit to spin;
512,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"My Love passed by, and he didn't come in;"
513,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"He passes by me, both day and night,"
514,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,And carries off my poor heart's delight.
515,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,
516,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"There is a tavern in yonder town,"
517,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,My Love goes there and he spends a crown;
518,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"He takes a strange girl upon his knee,"
519,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,And never more gives a thought to me.
520,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,
521,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"Says he, 'We'll wed without loss of time,"
522,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,And sure our love's but a little crime;'--
523,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"My apron-string now it's wearing short,"
524,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,And my Love he seeks other girls to court.
525,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,
526,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"O with him I'd go if I had my will,"
527,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,I'd follow him barefoot o'er rock and hill;
528,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,I'd never once speak of all my grief
529,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,If he'd give me a smile for my heart's relief.
530,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,
531,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"In our wee garden the rose unfolds,"
532,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,With bachelor's-buttons and marigolds;
533,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"I'll tie no posies for dance or fair,"
534,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,A willow-twig is for me to wear.
535,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,
536,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"For a maid again I can never be,"
537,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,Till the red rose blooms on the willow tree.
538,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"Of such a trouble I've heard them tell,"
539,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,And now I know what it means full well.
540,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,
541,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"As through the long lonesome night I lie,"
542,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,I'd give the world if I might but cry;
543,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"But I mus'n't moan there or raise my voice,"
544,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,And the tears run down without any noise.
545,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,
546,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"And what, O what will my mother say?"
547,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,She'll wish her daughter was in the clay.
548,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,My father will curse me to my face;
549,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,The neighbours will know of my black disgrace.
550,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,
551,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"My sister's buried three years, come Lent;"
552,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,But sure we made far too much lament.
553,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,Beside her grave they still say a prayer--
554,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,I wish to God 'twas myself was there!
555,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,
556,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,The Candlemas crosses hang near my bed;
557,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"To look at them puts me much in dread,"
558,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,They mark the good time that's gone and past:
559,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,It's like this year's one will prove the last.
560,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,
561,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"The oldest cross it's a dusty brown,"
562,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,But the winter winds didn't shake it down;
563,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,The newest cross keeps the colour bright;
564,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,When the straw was reaping my heart was light.
565,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,
566,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"The reapers rose with the blink of morn,"
567,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,And gaily stook'd up the yellow corn;
568,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"To call them home to the field I'd run,"
569,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,Through the blowing breeze and the summer sun.
570,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,
571,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"When the straw was weaving my heart was glad,"
572,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"For neither sin nor shame I had,"
573,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"In the barn where oat-chaff was flying round,"
574,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,And the thumping flails made a pleasant sound.
575,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,
576,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,Now summer or winter to me it's one;
577,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,But oh! for a day like the time that's gone.
578,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"I'd little care was it storm or shine,"
579,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,If I had but peace in this heart of mine.
580,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,
581,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"Oh! light and false is a young man's kiss,"
582,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,And a foolish girl gives her soul for this.
583,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"Oh! light and short is the young man's blame,"
584,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,And a helpless girl has the grief and shame.
585,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,
586,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"To the river-bank once I thought to go,"
587,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,And cast myself in the stream below;
588,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"I thought 'twould carry us far out to sea,"
589,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,Where they'd never find my poor babe and me.
590,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,
591,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"Sweet Lord, forgive me that wicked mind!"
592,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,You know I used to be well-inclined.
593,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"Oh, take compassion upon my state,"
594,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,Because my trouble is so very great.
595,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,
596,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,"My head turns round with the spinning wheel,"
597,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,And a heavy cloud on my eyes I feel.
598,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,But the worst of all is at my heart's core;
599,THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION,For my innocent days will come back no more.

605,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,
606,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,
607,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,I once was a guest at a Nobleman's wedding;
608,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,"Fair was the Bride, but she scarce had been kind,"
609,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,"And now in our mirth, she had tears nigh the shedding"
610,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,Her former true lover still runs in her mind.
611,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,
612,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,"Attired like a minstrel, her former true lover"
613,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,"Takes up his harp, and runs over the strings;"
614,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,"And there among strangers, his grief to discover,"
615,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,A fair maiden's falsehood he bitterly sings.
616,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,
617,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,'Now here is the token of gold that was broken;
618,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,Seven long years it was kept for your sake;
619,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,You gave it to me as a true lover's token;
620,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,"No longer I'll wear it, asleep or awake.'"
621,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,
622,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,"She sat in her place by the head of the table,"
623,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,The words of his ditty she mark'd them right well:
624,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,"To sit any longer this bride was not able,"
625,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,So down at the bridegroom's feet she fell.
626,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,
627,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,"'O one, one request, my lord, one and no other,"
628,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,O this one request will you grant it to me?
629,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,"To lie for this night in the arms of my mother,"
630,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,"And ever, and ever thereafter with thee.'"
631,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,
632,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,"Her one, one request it was granted her fairly;"
633,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,Pale were her cheeks as she went up to bed;
634,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,"And the very next morning, early, early,"
635,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,They rose and they found this young bride was dead.
636,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,
637,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,"The bridegroom ran quickly, he held her, he kiss'd her,"
638,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,"He spoke loud and low, and listen'd full fain;"
639,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,He call'd on her waiting-maids round to assist her
640,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,But nothing could bring the lost breath back again.
641,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,
642,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,O carry her softly! the grave is made ready;
643,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,At head and at foot plant a laurel-bush green;
644,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,"For she was a young and a sweet noble lady,"
645,THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING,The fairest young bride that I ever have seen.

769,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,"Sued each night to make them stay,"
770,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,Sadden'd when they went away.
771,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,"Years ago, and years ago;"
772,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,And the tall reeds sigh as the wind doth blow.
773,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,
774,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,Hands that shook with love and fear
775,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,"Dared put back the village clock,--"
776,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,"Flew the spindle, turn'd the rock,"
777,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,"Flow'd the song with subtle rounding,"
778,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,Till the false 'eleven' was sounding;
779,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,Then these Maids of Elfin-Mere
780,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,"Swiftly, softly, left the room,"
781,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,Like three doves on snowy plume.
782,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,"Years ago, and years ago;"
783,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,And the tall reeds sigh as the wind doth blow.
784,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,
785,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,One that night who wander'd near
786,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,"Heard lamentings by the shore,"
787,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,Saw at dawn three stains of gore
788,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,In the waters fade and dwindle.
789,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,Never more with song and spindle
790,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,"Saw we Maids of Elfin-Mere,"
791,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,The Pastor's Son did pine and die;
792,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,Because true love should never lie.
793,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,"Years ago, and years ago;"
794,THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE,And the tall reeds sigh as the wind doth blow.

870,THE LOVER AND BIRDS,Then spread his sooty wings and flitted to the croft
871,THE LOVER AND BIRDS,With cackling laugh;
872,THE LOVER AND BIRDS,"Whom I, being half"

908,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,
909,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,The Abbot of Innisfallen
910,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,awoke ere dawn of day;
911,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,Under the dewy green leaves
912,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,went he forth to pray.
913,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,The lake around his island
914,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"lay smooth and dark and deep,"
915,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,And wrapt in a misty stillness
916,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,the mountains were all asleep.
917,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,Low kneel'd the Abbot Cormac
918,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,when the dawn was dim and gray;
919,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,The prayers of his holy office
920,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,he faithfully 'gan say.
921,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,Low kneel'd the Abbot Cormac
922,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,while the dawn was waxing red;
923,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,And for his sins' forgiveness
924,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,a solemn prayer he said:
925,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,Low kneel'd that holy Abbot
926,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,while the dawn was waxing clear;
927,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,And he pray'd with loving-kindness
928,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,for his convent-brethren dear.
929,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,Low kneel'd that blessed Abbot
930,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,while the dawn was waxing bright;
931,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"He pray'd a great prayer for Ireland,"
932,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,he pray'd with all his might.
933,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,Low kneel'd that good old Father
934,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,while the sun began to dart;
935,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"He pray'd a prayer for all men,"
936,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,he pray'd it from his heart.
937,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"His blissful soul was in Heaven,"
938,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,tho' a breathing man was he;
939,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"He was out of time's dominion,"
940,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,so far as the living may be.
941,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,
942,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,The Abbot of Innisfallen
943,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,arose upon his feet;
944,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"He heard a small bird singing,"
945,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,and O but it sung sweet!
946,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"It sung upon a holly-bush,"
947,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,this little snow-white bird;
948,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,A song so full of gladness
949,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,he never before had heard.
950,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"It sung upon a hazel,"
951,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,it sung upon a thorn;
952,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,He had never heard such music
953,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,since the hour that he was born.
954,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"It sung upon a sycamore,"
955,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,it sung upon a briar;
956,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,To follow the song and hearken
957,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,this Abbot could never tire.
958,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,Till at last he well bethought him;
959,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,he might no longer stay;
960,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"So he bless'd the little white singing-bird,"
961,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,and gladly went his way.
962,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,
963,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"But, when he came to his Abbey,"
964,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,he found a wondrous change;
965,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"He saw no friendly faces there,"
966,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,for every face was strange.
967,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,The strange men spoke unto him;
968,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,and he heard from all and each
969,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"The foreign tongue of the Sassenach,"
970,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,not wholesome Irish speech.
971,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"Then the oldest monk came forward,"
972,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,in Irish tongue spake he:
973,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"'Thou wearest the holy Augustine's dress,"
974,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,and who hath given it to thee?'
975,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"'I wear the Augustine's dress,"
976,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"and Cormac is my name,"
977,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,The Abbot of this good Abbey
978,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,by grace of God I am.
979,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"I went forth to pray, at the dawn of day;"
980,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"and when my prayers were said,"
981,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"I hearken'd awhile to a little bird,"
982,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,that sung above my head.'
983,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"The monks to him made answer,"
984,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"'Two hundred years have gone o'er,"
985,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"Since our Abbot Cormac went through the gate,"
986,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,and never was heard of more.
987,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"Matthias now is our Abbot,"
988,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,and twenty have pass'd away.
989,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,The stranger is lord of Ireland;
990,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,we live in an evil day.'
991,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"'Days will come and go,' he said,"
992,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"'and the world will pass away,"
993,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"In Heaven a day is a thousand years,"
994,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,a thousand years are a day.'
995,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,'Now give me absolution;
996,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"for my time is come,' said he."
997,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"And they gave him absolution,"
998,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,as speedily as might be.
999,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"Then, close outside the window,"
1000,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,the sweetest song they heard
1001,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,That ever yet since the world began
1002,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,was utter'd by any bird.
1003,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"The monks look'd out and saw the bird,"
1004,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,its feathers all white and clean;
1005,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"And there in a moment, beside it,"
1006,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,another white bird was seen.
1007,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"Those two they sang together,"
1008,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"waved their white wings, and fled;"
1009,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"Flew aloft, and vanish'd;"
1010,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,but the good old man was dead.
1011,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,They buried his blessed body
1012,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,where lake and green-sward meet;
1013,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"A carven cross above his head,"
1014,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,a holly-bush at his feet;
1015,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,Where spreads the beautiful water
1016,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,"to gay or cloudy skies,"
1017,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,And the purple peaks of Killarney
1018,THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN,from ancient woods arise.

1030,THE RUINED CHAPEL,And bring no touch of human sound.
1031,THE RUINED CHAPEL,
1032,THE RUINED CHAPEL,"Washing of the lonely seas,"

1043,THE RUINED CHAPEL,
1044,THE RUINED CHAPEL,"The empty ruins, lapsed again"
1045,THE RUINED CHAPEL,"Into Nature's wide domain,"
1046,THE RUINED CHAPEL,Sow themselves with seed and grain
1047,THE RUINED CHAPEL,As Day and Night and Day go by;
1048,THE RUINED CHAPEL,And hoard June's sun and April's rain.
1049,THE RUINED CHAPEL,
1050,THE RUINED CHAPEL,Here fresh funeral tears were shed;
1051,THE RUINED CHAPEL,Now the graves are also dead;
1052,THE RUINED CHAPEL,"And suckers from the ash-tree spread,"
1053,THE RUINED CHAPEL,While Day and Night and Day go by;
1054,THE RUINED CHAPEL,And stars move calmly overhead.
