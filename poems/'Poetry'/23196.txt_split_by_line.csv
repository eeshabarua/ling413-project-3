36,TO THE LITTLE HOUSE,"Dear little house, dear shabby street,"
37,TO THE LITTLE HOUSE,Dear books and beds and food to eat!
38,TO THE LITTLE HOUSE,How feeble words are to express
39,TO THE LITTLE HOUSE,The facets of your tenderness.
40,TO THE LITTLE HOUSE,
41,TO THE LITTLE HOUSE,How white the sun comes through the pane!
42,TO THE LITTLE HOUSE,In tinkling music drips the rain!
43,TO THE LITTLE HOUSE,How burning bright the furnace glows!
44,TO THE LITTLE HOUSE,What paths to shovel when it snows!
45,TO THE LITTLE HOUSE,
46,TO THE LITTLE HOUSE,O dearly loved Long Island trains!
47,TO THE LITTLE HOUSE,O well remembered joys and pains....
48,TO THE LITTLE HOUSE,How near the housetops Beauty leans
49,TO THE LITTLE HOUSE,Along that little street in Queens!
50,TO THE LITTLE HOUSE,
51,TO THE LITTLE HOUSE,Let these poor rhymes abide for proof
52,TO THE LITTLE HOUSE,Joy dwells beneath a humble roof;
53,TO THE LITTLE HOUSE,Heaven is not built of country seats
54,TO THE LITTLE HOUSE,But little queer suburban streets!

289,PETER PAN,
290,PETER PAN,And Peter Pan is dead? not so!
291,PETER PAN,When mothers turn the lights down low
292,PETER PAN,"And tuck their little sons in bed,"
293,PETER PAN,They know that Peter is not dead....
294,PETER PAN,
295,PETER PAN,That little rounded blanket-hill;
296,PETER PAN,"Those prayer-time eyes, so deep and still--"
297,PETER PAN,However wise and great a man
298,PETER PAN,"He grows, he still is Peter Pan."
299,PETER PAN,
300,PETER PAN,And mothers' ways are often queer:
301,PETER PAN,"They pause in doorways, just to hear"
302,PETER PAN,A tiny breathing; think a prayer;
303,PETER PAN,And then go tiptoe down the stair.

346,THE 5:42,Home at length is heart's desire!
347,THE 5:42,"Gone is weariness and fret,"

1927,ON FIRST LOOKING INTO A SUBWAY EXCAVATION,I held my breath and improvised a prayer:
1928,ON FIRST LOOKING INTO A SUBWAY EXCAVATION,I saw the solid street before me rise
1929,ON FIRST LOOKING INTO A SUBWAY EXCAVATION,And men and trolleys leap into the air.
