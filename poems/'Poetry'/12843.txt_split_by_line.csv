33,PREFACE,"In Mr. Cabot's prefatory note to the Riverside Edition of the Poems,"
34,PREFACE,"published the year after Mr. Emerson's death, he said:--"
35,PREFACE,
36,PREFACE,"""This volume contains nearly all the pieces included in the POEMS and"
37,PREFACE,"MAY-DAY of former editions. In 1876, Mr. Emerson published a selection"
38,PREFACE,"from his Poems, adding six new ones and omitting many[1]. Of those"
39,PREFACE,"omitted, several are now restored, in accordance with the expressed"
40,PREFACE,wishes of many readers and lovers of them. Also some pieces never
41,PREFACE,before published are here given in an Appendix; on various grounds.
42,PREFACE,"Some of them appear to have had Mr. Emerson's approval, but to have"
43,PREFACE,been withheld because they were unfinished. These it seemed best not to
44,PREFACE,"suppress, now that they can never receive their completion. Others,"
45,PREFACE,"mostly of an early date, remained unpublished, doubtless because of"
46,PREFACE,their personal and private nature. Some of these seem to have an
47,PREFACE,autobiographic interest sufficient to justify their publication. Others
48,PREFACE,"again, often mere fragments, have been admitted as characteristic, or"
49,PREFACE,as expressing in poetic form thoughts found in the Essays.
50,PREFACE,
51,PREFACE,[1] _Selected Poems_: Little Classic Edition.
52,PREFACE,
53,PREFACE,"""In coming to a decision in these cases it seemed, on the whole,"
54,PREFACE,preferable to take the risk of including too much rather than the
55,PREFACE,"opposite, and to leave the task of further winnowing to the hands of"
56,PREFACE,Time.
57,PREFACE,
58,PREFACE,"""As was stated in the preface to the first volume of this edition of"
59,PREFACE,"Mr. Emerson's writings, the readings adopted by him in the Selected"
60,PREFACE,"Poems have not always been followed here, but in some cases preference"
61,PREFACE,has been given to corrections made by him when he was in fuller
62,PREFACE,strength than at the time of the last revision.
63,PREFACE,
64,PREFACE,"""A change in the arrangement of the stanzas of 'May-Day,' in the part"
65,PREFACE,"representative of the march of Spring, received his sanction as"
66,PREFACE,"bringing them more nearly in accordance with the events in Nature."""
67,PREFACE,
68,PREFACE,"In the preparation of the Riverside Edition of the _Poems_, Mr. Cabot"
69,PREFACE,very considerately took the present editor into counsel (as
70,PREFACE,"representing Mr. Emerson's family), who at that time in turn took"
71,PREFACE,counsel with several persons of taste and mature judgment with regard
72,PREFACE,especially to the admission of poems hitherto unpublished and of
73,PREFACE,fragments that seemed interested and pleasing. Mr. Cabot and he were
74,PREFACE,entirely in accord with regard to the Riverside Edition. In the present
75,PREFACE,"edition, the substance of the Riverside Edition has been preserved,"
76,PREFACE,"with hardly an exception, although some poems and fragments have been"
77,PREFACE,"added. None of the poems therein printed have been omitted. ""The"
78,PREFACE,"House,"" which appeared in the first volume of _Poems_, and ""Nemesis,"""
79,PREFACE,"""Una,"" ""Love and Thought"" and ""Merlin's Songs,"" from the _May-Day_"
80,PREFACE,"volume, have been restored. To the few mottoes of the Essays, which Mr."
81,PREFACE,"Emerson printed as ""Elements"" in _May-Day_, most of the others have"
82,PREFACE,been added. Following Mr. Emerson's precedent of giving his brother
83,PREFACE,"Edward's ""Last Farewell"" a place beside the poem in his memory, two"
84,PREFACE,"pleasing poems by Ellen Tucker, his first wife, which he published in"
85,PREFACE,"the _Dial_, have been placed with his own poems relating to her. The"
86,PREFACE,publication in the last edition of some poems that Mr. Emerson had long
87,PREFACE,"kept by him, but had never quite been ready to print, and of various"
88,PREFACE,"fragments on Poetry, Nature and Life, was not done without advice and"
89,PREFACE,"careful consideration, and then was felt to be perhaps a rash"
90,PREFACE,experiment. The continued interest which has been shown in the author's
91,PREFACE,thought and methods and life--for these unfinished pieces contain much
92,PREFACE,autobiography--has made the present editor feel it justifiable to keep
93,PREFACE,almost all of these and to add a few. Their order has been slightly
94,PREFACE,altered.
95,PREFACE,
96,PREFACE,A few poems from the verse-books sufficiently complete to have a title
97,PREFACE,"are printed in the Appendix for the first time: ""Insight,"" ""September,"""
98,PREFACE,"""October,"" ""Hymn"" and ""Riches."""
99,PREFACE,
100,PREFACE,"After much hesitation the editor has gathered in their order of time,"
101,PREFACE,"and printed at the end of the book, some twenty early pieces, a few of"
102,PREFACE,them taken from the Appendix of the last edition and others never
103,PREFACE,printed before. They are for the most part journals in verse covering
104,PREFACE,"the period of his school-teaching, study for the ministry and exercise"
105,PREFACE,"of that office, his sickness, bereavement, travel abroad and return to"
106,PREFACE,the new life. This sad period of probation is illuminated by the
107,PREFACE,"episode of his first love. Not for their poetical merit, except in"
108,PREFACE,"flashes, but for the light they throw on the growth of his thought and"
109,PREFACE,character are they included.
110,PREFACE,
111,PREFACE,"In this volume the course of the Muse, as Emerson tells it, is pursued"
112,PREFACE,with regard to his own poems.
113,PREFACE,
114,PREFACE,"I hang my verses in the wind,"
115,PREFACE,Time and tide their faults will find.

338,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"The Emersons first appeared in the north of England, but Thomas, who"
339,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"landed in Massachusetts in 1638, came from Hertfordshire. He built soon"
340,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"after a house, sometimes railed the Saint's Rest, which still stands in"
341,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Ipswich on the slope of Heart-break Hill, close by Labour-in-vain Creek."
342,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,Ralph Waldo Emerson was the sixth in descent from him. He was born in
343,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Boston, in Summer Street, May 25, 1803. He was the third son of William"
344,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Emerson, the minister of the First Church in Boston, whose father,"
345,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"William Emerson, had been the patriotic minister of Concord at the"
346,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"outbreak of the Revolution, and died a chaplain in the army. Ruth"
347,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Haskins, the mother of Ralph Waldo Emerson, was left a widow in 1811,"
348,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,with a family of five little boys. The taste of these boys was
349,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"scholarly, and four of them went through the Latin School to Harvard"
350,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"College, and graduated there. Their mother was a person of great"
351,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"sweetness, dignity, and piety, bringing up her sons wisely and well in"
352,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"very straitened circumstances, and loved by them. Her husband's"
353,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"stepfather, Rev. Dr. Ripley of Concord, helped her, and constantly"
354,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"invited the boys to the Old Manse, so that the woods and fields along"
355,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,the Concord River were first a playground and then the background of the
356,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,dreams of their awakening imaginations.
357,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
358,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Born in the city, Emerson's young mind first found delight in poems and"
359,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"classic prose, to which his instincts led him as naturally as another"
360,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"boy's would to go fishing, but his vacations in the country supplemented"
361,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,these by giving him great and increasing love of nature. In his early
362,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,poems classic imagery is woven into pictures of New England woodlands.
363,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Even as a little boy he had the habit of attempting flights of verse,"
364,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"stimulated by Milton, Pope, or Scott, and he and his mates took pleasure"
365,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,in declaiming to each other in barns and attics. He was so full of
366,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"thoughts and fancies that he sought the pen instinctively, to jot them"
367,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,down.
368,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
369,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"At college Emerson did not shine as a scholar, though he won prizes for"
370,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"essays and declamations, being especially unfitted for mathematical"
371,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"studies, and enjoying the classics rather in a literary than grammatical"
372,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,way. And yet it is doubtful whether any man in his class used his time
373,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"to better purpose with reference to his after life, for young Emerson's"
374,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"instinct led him to wide reading of works, outside the curriculum, that"
375,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,spoke directly to him. He had already formed the habit of writing in a
376,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"journal, not the facts but the thoughts and inspirations of the day;"
377,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"often, also, good stories or poetical quotations, and scraps of his own"
378,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,verse.
379,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
380,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"On graduation from Harvard in the class of 1821, following the"
381,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"traditions of his family, Emerson resolved to study to be a minister,"
382,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,and meantime helped his older brother William in the support of the
383,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"family by teaching in a school for young ladies in Boston, that the"
384,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,former had successfully established. The principal was twenty-one and
385,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,the assistant nineteen years of age. For school-teaching on the usual
386,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"lines Emerson was not fitted, and his youth and shyness prevented him"
387,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"from imparting his best gifts to his scholars. Years later, when, in his"
388,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"age, his old scholars assembled to greet him, he regretted that no hint"
389,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"had been brought into the school of what at that very time ""I was"
390,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"writing every night in my chamber, my first thoughts on morals and the"
391,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"beautiful laws of compensation, and of individual genius, which to"
392,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"observe and illustrate have given sweetness to many years of my life."""
393,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,Yet many scholars remembered his presence and teaching with pleasure and
394,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"gratitude, not only in Boston, but in Chelmsford and Roxbury, for while"
395,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,his younger brothers were in college it was necessary that he should
396,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"help. In these years, as through all his youth, he was loved, spurred on"
397,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"in his intellectual life, and keenly criticised by his aunt, Mary Moody"
398,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Emerson, an eager and wide reader, inspired by religious zeal,"
399,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"high-minded, but eccentric."
400,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
401,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"The health of the young teacher suffered from too ascetic a life, and"
402,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"unmistakable danger-signals began to appear, fortunately heeded in time,"
403,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"but disappointment and delay resulted, borne, however, with sense and"
404,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,courage. His course at the Divinity School in Cambridge was much broken;
405,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"nevertheless, in October, 1826, he was ""approbated to preach"" by the"
406,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,Middlesex Association of Ministers. A winter at the North at this time
407,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"threatened to prove fatal, so he was sent South by his helpful kinsman,"
408,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Rev. Samuel Ripley, and passed the winter in Florida with benefit,"
409,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"working northward in the spring, preaching in the cities, and resumed"
410,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,his studies at Cambridge.
411,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
412,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"In 1829, Emerson was called by the Second or Old North Church in Boston"
413,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"to become the associate pastor with Rev. Henry Ware, and soon after,"
414,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"because of his senior's delicate health, was called on to assume the"
415,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"full duty. Theological dogmas, such as the Unitarian Church of"
416,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Channing's day accepted, did not appeal to Emerson, nor did the"
417,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,supernatural in religion in its ordinary acceptation interest him. The
418,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"omnipresence of spirit, the dignity of man, the daily miracle of the"
419,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"universe, were what he taught, and while the older members of the"
420,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,congregation may have been disquieted that he did not dwell on revealed
421,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"religion, his words reached the young people, stirred thought, and"
422,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,awakened aspiration. At this time he lived with his mother and his young
423,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,wife (Ellen Tucker) in Chardon Street. For three years he ministered to
424,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,his people in Boston. Then having felt the shock of being obliged to
425,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"conform to church usage, as stated prayer when the spirit did not move,"
426,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"and especially the administration of the Communion, he honestly laid his"
427,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"troubles before his people, and proposed to them some modification of"
428,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"this rite. While they considered his proposition, Emerson went into the"
429,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,White Mountains to weigh his conflicting duties to his church and
430,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"conscience. He came down, bravely to meet the refusal of the church to"
431,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"change the rite, and in a sermon preached in September, 1832, explained"
432,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"his objections to it, and, because he could not honestly administer it,"
433,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,resigned.
434,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
435,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"He parted from his people in all kindness, but the wrench was felt. His"
436,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"wife had recently died, he was ill himself, his life seemed to others"
437,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,broken up. But meantime voices from far away had reached him. He sailed
438,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"for Europe, landed in Italy, saw cities, and art, and men, but would not"
439,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"stay long. Of the dead, Michael Angelo appealed chiefly to him there;"
440,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Landor among the living. He soon passed northward, making little stay in"
441,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Paris, but sought out Carlyle, then hardly recognized, and living in the"
442,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,lonely hills of the Scottish Border. There began a friendship which had
443,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"great influence on the lives of both men, and lasted through life. He"
444,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,also visited Wordsworth. But the new life before him called him home.
445,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
446,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"He landed at Boston within the year in good health and hope, and joined"
447,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,his mother and youngest brother Charles in Newton. Frequent invitations
448,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"to preach still came, and were accepted, and he even was sounded as to"
449,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"succeeding Dr. Dewey in the church at New Bedford; but, as he stipulated"
450,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"for freedom from ceremonial, this came to nothing."
451,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
452,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"In the autumn of 1834 he moved to Concord, living with his kinsman, Dr."
453,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Ripley, at the Manse, but soon bought house and land on the Boston Road,"
454,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"on the edge of the village towards Walden woods. Thither, in the autumn,"
455,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"he brought his wife. Miss Lidian Jackson, of Plymouth, and this was"
456,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,their home during the rest of their lives.
457,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
458,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,The new life to which he had been called opened pleasantly and increased
459,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"in happiness and opportunity, except for the sadness of bereavements,"
460,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"for, in the first few years, his brilliant brothers Edward and Charles"
461,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"died, and soon afterward Waldo, his firstborn son, and later his mother."
462,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Emerson had left traditional religion, the city, the Old World, behind,"
463,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"and now went to Nature as his teacher, his inspiration. His first book,"
464,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"""Nature,"" which he was meditating while in Europe, was finished here,"
465,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,and published in 1836. His practice during all his life in Concord was
466,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"to go alone to the woods almost daily, sometimes to wait there for"
467,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"hours, and, when thus attuned, to receive the message to which he was to"
468,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"give voice. Though it might be colored by him in transmission, he held"
469,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,that the light was universal.
470,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
471,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"""Ever the words of the Gods resound,"
472,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,But the porches of man's ear
473,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,Seldom in this low life's round
474,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Are unsealed that he may hear."""
475,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
476,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"But he resorted, also, to the books of those who had handed down the"
477,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"oracles truly, and was quick to find the message destined for him. Men,"
478,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"too, he studied eagerly, the humblest and the highest, regretting always"
479,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,that the brand of the scholar on him often silenced the men of shop and
480,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"office where he came. He was everywhere a learner, expecting light from"
481,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,the youngest and least educated visitor. The thoughts combined with the
482,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"flower of his reading were gradually grouped into lectures, and his main"
483,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"occupation through life was reading these to who would hear, at first in"
484,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"courses in Boston, but later all over the country, for the Lyceum sprang"
485,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"up in New England in these years in every town, and spread westward to"
486,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,the new settlements even beyond the Mississippi. His winters were spent
487,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"in these rough, but to him interesting journeys, for he loved to watch"
488,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"the growth of the Republic in which he had faith, and his summers were"
489,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,spent in study and writing. These lectures were later severely pruned
490,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"and revised, and the best of them gathered into seven volumes of essays"
491,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"under different names between 1841 and 1876. The courses in Boston,"
492,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"which at first were given in the Masonic Temple, were always well"
493,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"attended by earnest and thoughtful people. The young, whether in years"
494,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"or in spirit, were always and to the end his audience of the spoken or"
495,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,written word. The freedom of the Lyceum platform pleased Emerson. He
496,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,found that people would hear on Wednesday with approval and
497,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,unsuspectingly doctrines from which on Sunday they felt officially
498,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,obliged to dissent.
499,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
500,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Mr. Lowell, in his essays, has spoken of these early lectures and what"
501,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,they were worth to him and others suffering from the generous discontent
502,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"of youth with things as they were. Emerson used to say, ""My strength and"
503,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"my doom is to be solitary;"" but to a retired scholar a wholesome offset"
504,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,to this was the travelling and lecturing in cities and in raw frontier
505,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"towns, bringing him into touch with the people, and this he knew and"
506,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,valued.
507,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
508,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"In 1837 Emerson gave the Phi Beta Kappa oration in Cambridge, The"
509,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"American Scholar, which increased his growing reputation, but the"
510,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,following year his Address to the Senior Class at the Divinity School
511,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"brought out, even from the friendly Unitarians, severe strictures and"
512,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,warnings against its dangerous doctrines. Of this heresy Emerson said:
513,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"""I deny personality to God because it is too little, not too much."" He"
514,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,really strove to elevate the idea of God. Yet those who were pained or
515,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,shocked by his teachings respected Emerson. His lectures were still in
516,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,demand; he was often asked to speak by literary societies at orthodox
517,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"colleges. He preached regularly at East Lexington until 1838, but"
518,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,thereafter withdrew from the ministerial office. At this time the
519,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,progressive and spiritually minded young people used to meet for
520,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"discussion and help in Boston, among them George Ripley, Cyrus Bartol,"
521,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"James Freeman Clarke, Alcott, Dr. Hedge, Margaret Fuller, and Elizabeth"
522,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Peabody. Perhaps from this gathering of friends, which Emerson attended,"
523,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"came what is called the Transcendental Movement, two results of which"
524,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"were the Brook Farm Community and the Dial magazine, in which last"
525,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Emerson took great interest, and was for the time an editor. Many of"
526,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,these friends were frequent visitors in Concord. Alcott moved thither
527,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,after the breaking up of his school. Hawthorne also came to dwell there.
528,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Henry Thoreau, a Concord youth, greatly interested Emerson; indeed,"
529,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"became for a year or two a valued inmate of his home, and helped and"
530,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"instructed him in the labors of the garden and little farm, which"
531,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"gradually grew to ten acres, the chief interest of which for the owner"
532,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"was his trees, which he loved and tended. Emerson helped introduce his"
533,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"countrymen to the teachings of Carlyle, and edited his works here, where"
534,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,they found more readers than at home.
535,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
536,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"In 1847 Emerson was invited to read lectures in England, and remained"
537,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"abroad a year, visiting France also in her troublous times. English"
538,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,Traits was a result. Just before this journey he had collected and
539,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"published his poems. A later volume, called May Day, followed in 1867."
540,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"He had written verses from childhood, and to the purified expression of"
541,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"poetry he, through life, eagerly aspired. He said, ""I like my poems"
542,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"best because it is not I who write them."" In 1866 the degree of Doctor"
543,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"of Laws was conferred on him by Harvard University, and he was chosen an"
544,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Overseer. In 1867 he again gave the Phi Beta Kappa oration, and in 1870"
545,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,and 1871 gave courses in Philosophy in the University Lectures at
546,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,Cambridge.
547,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
548,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,Emerson was not merely a man of letters. He recognized and did the
549,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,private and public duties of the hour. He exercised a wide hospitality
550,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"to souls as well as bodies. Eager youths came to him for rules, and went"
551,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"away with light. Reformers, wise and unwise, came to him, and were"
552,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,kindly received. They were often disappointed that they could not
553,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"harness him to their partial and transient scheme. He said, My reforms"
554,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"include theirs: I must go my way; help people by my strength, not by my"
555,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"weakness. But if a storm threatened, he felt bound to appear and show"
556,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,his colors. Against the crying evils of his time he worked bravely in
557,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,his own way. He wrote to President Van Buren against the wrong done to
558,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"the Cherokees, dared speak against the idolized Webster, when he"
559,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"deserted the cause of Freedom, constantly spoke of the iniquity of"
560,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"slavery, aided with speech and money the Free State cause in Kansas,"
561,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,was at Phillips's side at the antislavery meeting in 1861 broken up by
562,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"the Boston mob, urged emancipation during the war."
563,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
564,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"He enjoyed his Concord home and neighbors, served on the school"
565,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"committee for years, did much for the Lyceum, and spoke on the town's"
566,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"great occasions. He went to all town-meetings, oftener to listen and"
567,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"admire than to speak, and always took pleasure and pride in the people."
568,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,In return he was respected and loved by them.
569,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
570,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Emerson's house was destroyed by fire in 1872, and the incident exposure"
571,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,and fatigue did him harm. His many friends insisted on rebuilding his
572,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"house and sending him abroad to get well. He went up the Nile, and"
573,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"revisited England, finding old and new friends, and, on his return, was"
574,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,welcomed and escorted home by the people of Concord. After this time he
575,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,was unable to write. His old age was quiet and happy among his family
576,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"and friends. He died in April, 1882."

853,THE VISIT,
854,THE VISIT,"Askest, 'How long thou shalt stay?'"
855,THE VISIT,Devastator of the day!
856,THE VISIT,"Know, each substance and relation,"
857,THE VISIT,"Thorough nature's operation,"
858,THE VISIT,"Hath its unit, bound and metre;"
859,THE VISIT,And every new compound
860,THE VISIT,"Is some product and repeater,--"
861,THE VISIT,Product of the earlier found.
862,THE VISIT,"But the unit of the visit,"
863,THE VISIT,"The encounter of the wise,--"
864,THE VISIT,"Say, what other metre is it"
865,THE VISIT,Than the meeting of the eyes?
866,THE VISIT,Nature poureth into nature
867,THE VISIT,"Through the channels of that feature,"
868,THE VISIT,"Riding on the ray of sight,"
869,THE VISIT,"Fleeter far than whirlwinds go,"
870,THE VISIT,"Or for service, or delight,"
871,THE VISIT,"Hearts to hearts their meaning show,"
872,THE VISIT,"Sum their long experience,"
873,THE VISIT,And import intelligence.
874,THE VISIT,Single look has drained the breast;
875,THE VISIT,Single moment years confessed.
876,THE VISIT,The duration of a glance
877,THE VISIT,"Is the term of convenance,"
878,THE VISIT,"And, though thy rede be church or state,"
879,THE VISIT,Frugal multiples of that.
880,THE VISIT,Speeding Saturn cannot halt;

889,URIEL,It fell in the ancient periods
890,URIEL,"Which the brooding soul surveys,"
891,URIEL,Or ever the wild Time coined itself
892,URIEL,Into calendar months and days.
893,URIEL,
894,URIEL,"This was the lapse of Uriel,"
895,URIEL,Which in Paradise befell.
896,URIEL,"Once, among the Pleiads walking,"
897,URIEL,Seyd overheard the young gods talking;
898,URIEL,"And the treason, too long pent,"
899,URIEL,To his ears was evident.
900,URIEL,The young deities discussed
901,URIEL,"Laws of form, and metre just,"
902,URIEL,"Orb, quintessence, and sunbeams,"
903,URIEL,"What subsisteth, and what seems."
904,URIEL,"One, with low tones that decide,"
905,URIEL,"And doubt and reverend use defied,"
906,URIEL,"With a look that solved the sphere,"
907,URIEL,"And stirred the devils everywhere,"
908,URIEL,Gave his sentiment divine
909,URIEL,Against the being of a line.
910,URIEL,'Line in nature is not found;
911,URIEL,Unit and universe are round;
912,URIEL,"In vain produced, all rays return;"
913,URIEL,"Evil will bless, and ice will burn.'"
914,URIEL,"As Uriel spoke with piercing eye,"
915,URIEL,A shudder ran around the sky;
916,URIEL,"The stern old war-gods shook their heads,"
917,URIEL,The seraphs frowned from myrtle-beds;
918,URIEL,Seemed to the holy festival
919,URIEL,The rash word boded ill to all;
920,URIEL,The balance-beam of Fate was bent;
921,URIEL,The bounds of good and ill were rent;
922,URIEL,"Strong Hades could not keep his own,"
923,URIEL,But all slid to confusion.
924,URIEL,
925,URIEL,"A sad self-knowledge, withering, fell"
926,URIEL,On the beauty of Uriel;
927,URIEL,"In heaven once eminent, the god"
928,URIEL,"Withdrew, that hour, into his cloud;"
929,URIEL,Whether doomed to long gyration
930,URIEL,"In the sea of generation,"
931,URIEL,Or by knowledge grown too bright
932,URIEL,To hit the nerve of feebler sight.
933,URIEL,"Straightway, a forgetting wind"
934,URIEL,"Stole over the celestial kind,"
935,URIEL,"And their lips the secret kept,"
936,URIEL,If in ashes the fire-seed slept.
937,URIEL,"But now and then, truth-speaking things"
938,URIEL,Shamed the angels' veiling wings;
939,URIEL,"And, shrilling from the solar course,"
940,URIEL,"Or from fruit of chemic force,"
941,URIEL,"Procession of a soul in matter,"
942,URIEL,"Or the speeding change of water,"
943,URIEL,"Or out of the good of evil born,"
944,URIEL,"Came Uriel's voice of cherub scorn,"
945,URIEL,"And a blush tinged the upper sky,"
946,URIEL,"And the gods shook, they knew not why."

987,THE WORLD-SOUL,

1005,THE WORLD-SOUL,
1006,THE WORLD-SOUL,"If but one hero knew it,"
1007,THE WORLD-SOUL,The world would blush in flame;

1286,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,Hear the sentiment of Spain.
1287,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,
1288,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,You have tried famine: no more try it;
1289,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,Ply us now with a full diet;
1290,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,"Teach your pupils now with plenty,"
1291,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,For one sun supply us twenty.
1292,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,"I have thought it thoroughly over,--"
1293,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,"State of hermit, state of lover;"
1294,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,"We must have society,"
1295,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,We cannot spare variety.
1296,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,"Hear you, then, celestial fellows!"
1297,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,Fits not to be overzealous;
1298,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,"Steads not to work on the clean jump,"
1299,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,Nor wine nor brains perpetual pump.
1300,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,Men and gods are too extense;
1301,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,Could you slacken and condense?
1302,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,Your rank overgrowths reduce
1303,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,Till your kinds abound with juice?
1304,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,"Earth, crowded, cries, 'Too many men!'"
1305,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,"My counsel is, kill nine in ten,"
1306,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,And bestow the shares of all
1307,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,On the remnant decimal.
1308,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,Add their nine lives to this cat;
1309,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,Stuff their nine brains in one hat;
1310,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,Make his frame and forces square
1311,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,With the labors he must dare;
1312,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,"Thatch his flesh, and even his years"
1313,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,With the marble which he rears.
1314,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,"There, growing slowly old at ease"
1315,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,"No faster than his planted trees,"
1316,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,"He may, by warrant of his age,"
1317,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,In schemes of broader scope engage.
1318,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,So shall ye have a man of the sphere
1319,ALPHONSO OF CASTILE,Fit to grace the solar year.

1715,THE SNOW-STORM,"So fanciful, so savage, nought cares he"
1716,THE SNOW-STORM,"For number or proportion. Mockingly,"
1717,THE SNOW-STORM,On coop or kennel he hangs Parian wreaths;
1718,THE SNOW-STORM,A swan-like form invests the hidden thorn;
1719,THE SNOW-STORM,"Fills up the farmer's lane from wall to wall,"
1720,THE SNOW-STORM,Maugre the farmer's sighs; and at the gate
1721,THE SNOW-STORM,A tapering turret overtops the work.
1722,THE SNOW-STORM,"And when his hours are numbered, and the world"

1780,WOODNOTES I,"It opened in its virgin bower,"

1791,WOODNOTES I,He saw the partridge drum in the woods;
1792,WOODNOTES I,He heard the woodcock's evening hymn;
1793,WOODNOTES I,He found the tawny thrushes' broods;
1794,WOODNOTES I,And the shy hawk did wait for him;
1795,WOODNOTES I,"What others did at distance hear,"
1796,WOODNOTES I,"And guessed within the thicket's gloom,"
1797,WOODNOTES I,"Was shown to this philosopher,"

1802,WOODNOTES I,In unploughed Maine he sought the lumberers' gang

1804,WOODNOTES I,"He trode the unplanted forest floor, whereon"
1805,WOODNOTES I,The all-seeing sun for ages hath not shone;
1806,WOODNOTES I,"Where feeds the moose, and walks the surly bear,"
1807,WOODNOTES I,And up the tall mast runs the woodpecker.
1808,WOODNOTES I,"He saw beneath dim aisles, in odorous beds,"
1809,WOODNOTES I,"The slight Linnaea hang its twin-born heads,"
1810,WOODNOTES I,"And blessed the monument of the man of flowers,"
1811,WOODNOTES I,Which breathes his sweet fame through the northern bowers.
1812,WOODNOTES I,"He heard, when in the grove, at intervals,"
1813,WOODNOTES I,"With sudden roar the aged pine-tree falls,--"
1814,WOODNOTES I,"One crash, the death-hymn of the perfect tree,"
1815,WOODNOTES I,Declares the close of its green century.
1816,WOODNOTES I,Low lies the plant to whose creation went
1817,WOODNOTES I,Sweet influence from every element;
1818,WOODNOTES I,"Whose living towers the years conspired to build,"
1819,WOODNOTES I,Whose giddy top the morning loved to gild.
1820,WOODNOTES I,"Through these green tents, by eldest Nature dressed,"
1821,WOODNOTES I,"He roamed, content alike with man and beast."
1822,WOODNOTES I,Where darkness found him he lay glad at night;
1823,WOODNOTES I,There the red morning touched him with its light.
1824,WOODNOTES I,"Three moons his great heart him a hermit made,"
1825,WOODNOTES I,So long he roved at will the boundless shade.
1826,WOODNOTES I,"The timid it concerns to ask their way,"
1827,WOODNOTES I,"And fear what foe in caves and swamps can stray,"
1828,WOODNOTES I,"To make no step until the event is known,"
1829,WOODNOTES I,And ills to come as evils past bemoan.
1830,WOODNOTES I,Not so the wise; no coward watch he keeps
1831,WOODNOTES I,To spy what danger on his pathway creeps;
1832,WOODNOTES I,"Go where he will, the wise man is at home,"
1833,WOODNOTES I,"His hearth the earth,--his hall the azure dome;"

1847,WOODNOTES I,"The musing peasant, lowly great,"
1848,WOODNOTES I,Beside the forest water sate;
1849,WOODNOTES I,The rope-like pine-roots crosswise grown
1850,WOODNOTES I,Composed the network of his throne;
1851,WOODNOTES I,"The wide lake, edged with sand and grass,"
1852,WOODNOTES I,"Was burnished to a floor of glass,"
1853,WOODNOTES I,Painted with shadows green and proud
1854,WOODNOTES I,Of the tree and of the cloud.

1861,WOODNOTES I,"'You ask,' he said, 'what guide"
1862,WOODNOTES I,"Me through trackless thickets led,"
1863,WOODNOTES I,Through thick-stemmed woodlands rough and wide.
1864,WOODNOTES I,I found the water's bed.
1865,WOODNOTES I,The watercourses were my guide;
1866,WOODNOTES I,"I travelled grateful by their side,"
1867,WOODNOTES I,Or through their channel dry;
1868,WOODNOTES I,"They led me through the thicket damp,"
1869,WOODNOTES I,"Through brake and fern, the beavers' camp,"
1870,WOODNOTES I,"Through beds of granite cut my road,"
1871,WOODNOTES I,And their resistless friendship showed.
1872,WOODNOTES I,"The falling waters led me,"
1873,WOODNOTES I,"The foodful waters fed me,"
1874,WOODNOTES I,"And brought me to the lowest land,"
1875,WOODNOTES I,Unerring to the ocean sand.
1876,WOODNOTES I,The moss upon the forest bark
1877,WOODNOTES I,Was pole-star when the night was dark;
1878,WOODNOTES I,The purple berries in the wood
1879,WOODNOTES I,Supplied me necessary food;
1880,WOODNOTES I,For Nature ever faithful is
1881,WOODNOTES I,To such as trust her faithfulness.
1882,WOODNOTES I,"When the forest shall mislead me,"

2005,WOODNOTES II,"Of rounded worlds, of space and time,"

2013,WOODNOTES II,"O, listen to the undersong,"
2014,WOODNOTES II,"The ever old, the ever young;"
2015,WOODNOTES II,"And, far within those cadent pauses,"
2016,WOODNOTES II,The chorus of the ancient Causes!
2017,WOODNOTES II,Delights the dreadful Destiny
2018,WOODNOTES II,"To fling his voice into the tree,"

2089,WOODNOTES II,"The hills where health with health agrees,"
2090,WOODNOTES II,And the wise soul expels disease.
2091,WOODNOTES II,Hark! in thy ear I will tell the sign

2116,WOODNOTES II,
2117,WOODNOTES II,"'Alas! thine is the bankruptcy,"
2118,WOODNOTES II,Blessed Nature so to see.
2119,WOODNOTES II,"Come, lay thee in my soothing shade,"
2120,WOODNOTES II,And heal the hurts which sin has made.
2121,WOODNOTES II,I see thee in the crowd alone;
2122,WOODNOTES II,I will be thy companion.
2123,WOODNOTES II,"Quit thy friends as the dead in doom,"
2124,WOODNOTES II,And build to them a final tomb;
2125,WOODNOTES II,Let the starred shade that nightly falls
2126,WOODNOTES II,"Still celebrate their funerals,"
2127,WOODNOTES II,And the bell of beetle and of bee
2128,WOODNOTES II,Knell their melodious memory.
2129,WOODNOTES II,"Behind thee leave thy merchandise,"
2130,WOODNOTES II,Thy churches and thy charities;
2131,WOODNOTES II,And leave thy peacock wit behind;
2132,WOODNOTES II,Enough for thee the primal mind
2133,WOODNOTES II,"That flows in streams, that breathes in wind:"
2134,WOODNOTES II,Leave all thy pedant lore apart;
2135,WOODNOTES II,God hid the whole world in thy heart.
2136,WOODNOTES II,"Love shuns the sage, the child it crowns,"
2137,WOODNOTES II,Gives all to them who all renounce.
2138,WOODNOTES II,The rain comes when the wind calls;
2139,WOODNOTES II,The river knows the way to the sea;
2140,WOODNOTES II,"Without a pilot it runs and falls,"
2141,WOODNOTES II,Blessing all lands with its charity;
2142,WOODNOTES II,The sea tosses and foams to find
2143,WOODNOTES II,Its way up to the cloud and wind;
2144,WOODNOTES II,The shadow sits close to the flying ball;
2145,WOODNOTES II,The date fails not on the palm-tree tall;
2146,WOODNOTES II,"And thou,--go burn thy wormy pages,--"
2147,WOODNOTES II,"Shalt outsee seers, and outwit sages."
2148,WOODNOTES II,Oft didst thou thread the woods in vain
2149,WOODNOTES II,To find what bird had piped the strain:--
2150,WOODNOTES II,"Seek not, and the little eremite"
2151,WOODNOTES II,Flies gayly forth and sings in sight.
2152,WOODNOTES II,
2153,WOODNOTES II,'Hearken once more!
2154,WOODNOTES II,I will tell thee the mundane lore.
2155,WOODNOTES II,"Older am I than thy numbers wot,"
2156,WOODNOTES II,"Change I may, but I pass not."
2157,WOODNOTES II,"Hitherto all things fast abide,"
2158,WOODNOTES II,And anchored in the tempest ride.
2159,WOODNOTES II,Trenchant time behoves to hurry
2160,WOODNOTES II,All to yean and all to bury:
2161,WOODNOTES II,"All the forms are fugitive,"
2162,WOODNOTES II,But the substances survive.
2163,WOODNOTES II,"Ever fresh the broad creation,"
2164,WOODNOTES II,"A divine improvisation,"
2165,WOODNOTES II,"From the heart of God proceeds,"
2166,WOODNOTES II,"A single will, a million deeds."
2167,WOODNOTES II,"Once slept the world an egg of stone,"
2168,WOODNOTES II,"And pulse, and sound, and light was none;"
2169,WOODNOTES II,"And God said, ""Throb!"" and there was motion"
2170,WOODNOTES II,And the vast mass became vast ocean.
2171,WOODNOTES II,"Onward and on, the eternal Pan,"
2172,WOODNOTES II,"Who layeth the world's incessant plan,"
2173,WOODNOTES II,"Halteth never in one shape,"
2174,WOODNOTES II,"But forever doth escape,"
2175,WOODNOTES II,"Like wave or flame, into new forms"
2176,WOODNOTES II,"Of gem, and air, of plants, and worms."
2177,WOODNOTES II,"I, that to-day am a pine,"
2178,WOODNOTES II,Yesterday was a bundle of grass.
2179,WOODNOTES II,"He is free and libertine,"
2180,WOODNOTES II,Pouring of his power the wine
2181,WOODNOTES II,"To every age, to every race;"
2182,WOODNOTES II,Unto every race and age
2183,WOODNOTES II,He emptieth the beverage;
2184,WOODNOTES II,"Unto each, and unto all,"
2185,WOODNOTES II,Maker and original.
2186,WOODNOTES II,"The world is the ring of his spells,"
2187,WOODNOTES II,And the play of his miracles.
2188,WOODNOTES II,"As he giveth to all to drink,"
2189,WOODNOTES II,Thus or thus they are and think.
2190,WOODNOTES II,With one drop sheds form and feature;
2191,WOODNOTES II,With the next a special nature;
2192,WOODNOTES II,The third adds heat's indulgent spark;
2193,WOODNOTES II,The fourth gives light which eats the dark;
2194,WOODNOTES II,"Into the fifth himself he flings,"
2195,WOODNOTES II,And conscious Law is King of kings.
2196,WOODNOTES II,"As the bee through the garden ranges,"
2197,WOODNOTES II,From world to world the godhead changes;
2198,WOODNOTES II,"As the sheep go feeding in the waste,"
2199,WOODNOTES II,From form to form He maketh haste;
2200,WOODNOTES II,This vault which glows immense with light
2201,WOODNOTES II,Is the inn where he lodges for a night.
2202,WOODNOTES II,What recks such Traveller if the bowers
2203,WOODNOTES II,Which bloom and fade like meadow flowers
2204,WOODNOTES II,"A bunch of fragrant lilies be,"
2205,WOODNOTES II,Or the stars of eternity?
2206,WOODNOTES II,"Alike to him the better, the worse,--"
2207,WOODNOTES II,"The glowing angel, the outcast corse."
2208,WOODNOTES II,"Thou metest him by centuries,"
2209,WOODNOTES II,And lo! he passes like the breeze;
2210,WOODNOTES II,"Thou seek'st in globe and galaxy,"
2211,WOODNOTES II,He hides in pure transparency;
2212,WOODNOTES II,"Thou askest in fountains and in fires,"
2213,WOODNOTES II,He is the essence that inquires.
2214,WOODNOTES II,He is the axis of the star;
2215,WOODNOTES II,He is the sparkle of the spar;
2216,WOODNOTES II,He is the heart of every creature;
2217,WOODNOTES II,He is the meaning of each feature;
2218,WOODNOTES II,And his mind is the sky.
2219,WOODNOTES II,"Than all it holds more deep, more high.'"

2224,MONADNOC,
2225,MONADNOC,"Thousand minstrels woke within me,"
2226,MONADNOC,'Our music's in the hills;'--
2227,MONADNOC,"Gayest pictures rose to win me,"
2228,MONADNOC,Leopard-colored rills.
2229,MONADNOC,'Up!--If thou knew'st who calls
2230,MONADNOC,"To twilight parks of beech and pine,"
2231,MONADNOC,"High over the river intervals,"
2232,MONADNOC,"Above the ploughman's highest line,"
2233,MONADNOC,Over the owner's farthest walls!
2234,MONADNOC,Up! where the airy citadel
2235,MONADNOC,O'erlooks the surging landscape's swell!
2236,MONADNOC,Let not unto the stones the Day
2237,MONADNOC,"Her lily and rose, her sea and land display."
2238,MONADNOC,Read the celestial sign!
2239,MONADNOC,Lo! the south answers to the north;
2240,MONADNOC,"Bookworm, break this sloth urbane;"
2241,MONADNOC,A greater spirit bids thee forth
2242,MONADNOC,Than the gray dreams which thee detain.
2243,MONADNOC,Mark how the climbing Oreads
2244,MONADNOC,Beckon thee to their arcades;
2245,MONADNOC,"Youth, for a moment free as they,"
2246,MONADNOC,"Teach thy feet to feel the ground,"
2247,MONADNOC,Ere yet arrives the wintry day
2248,MONADNOC,When Time thy feet has bound.
2249,MONADNOC,"Take the bounty of thy birth,"
2250,MONADNOC,Taste the lordship of the earth.'
2251,MONADNOC,
2252,MONADNOC,"I heard, and I obeyed,--"
2253,MONADNOC,"Assured that he who made the claim,"
2254,MONADNOC,"Well known, but loving not a name,"
2255,MONADNOC,Was not to be gainsaid.
2256,MONADNOC,"Ere yet the summoning voice was still,"
2257,MONADNOC,I turned to Cheshire's haughty hill.
2258,MONADNOC,From the fixed cone the cloud-rack flowed
2259,MONADNOC,Like ample banner flung abroad
2260,MONADNOC,To all the dwellers in the plains
2261,MONADNOC,"Round about, a hundred miles,"
2262,MONADNOC,With salutation to the sea and to the bordering isles.
2263,MONADNOC,"In his own loom's garment dressed,"
2264,MONADNOC,"By his proper bounty blessed,"
2265,MONADNOC,"Fast abides this constant giver,"
2266,MONADNOC,Pouring many a cheerful river;
2267,MONADNOC,"To far eyes, an aerial isle"
2268,MONADNOC,"Unploughed, which finer spirits pile,"
2269,MONADNOC,Which morn and crimson evening paint
2270,MONADNOC,"For bard, for lover and for saint;"
2271,MONADNOC,"An eyemark and the country's core,"
2272,MONADNOC,"Inspirer, prophet evermore;"
2273,MONADNOC,Pillar which God aloft had set
2274,MONADNOC,So that men might it not forget;
2275,MONADNOC,"It should be their life's ornament,"
2276,MONADNOC,And mix itself with each event;
2277,MONADNOC,"Gauge and calendar and dial,"
2278,MONADNOC,"Weatherglass and chemic phial,"
2279,MONADNOC,"Garden of berries, perch of birds,"
2280,MONADNOC,"Pasture of pool-haunting herds,"
2281,MONADNOC,"Graced by each change of sum untold,"
2282,MONADNOC,"Earth-baking heat, stone-cleaving cold."
2283,MONADNOC,
2284,MONADNOC,"The Titan heeds his sky-affairs,"
2285,MONADNOC,Rich rents and wide alliance shares;
2286,MONADNOC,Mysteries of color daily laid
2287,MONADNOC,By morn and eve in light and shade;
2288,MONADNOC,"And sweet varieties of chance,"
2289,MONADNOC,And the mystic seasons' dance;
2290,MONADNOC,And thief-like step of liberal hours
2291,MONADNOC,Thawing snow-drift into flowers.
2292,MONADNOC,"O, wondrous craft of plant and stone"
2293,MONADNOC,By eldest science wrought and shown!
2294,MONADNOC,
2295,MONADNOC,"'Happy,' I said, 'whose home is here!"
2296,MONADNOC,Fair fortunes to the mountaineer!
2297,MONADNOC,Boon Nature to his poorest shed
2298,MONADNOC,Has royal pleasure-grounds outspread.'
2299,MONADNOC,"Intent, I searched the region round,"
2300,MONADNOC,And in low hut the dweller found:
2301,MONADNOC,Woe is me for my hope's downfall!
2302,MONADNOC,Is yonder squalid peasant all
2303,MONADNOC,That this proud nursery could breed
2304,MONADNOC,For God's vicegerency and stead?
2305,MONADNOC,"Time out of mind, this forge of ores;"
2306,MONADNOC,Quarry of spars in mountain pores;
2307,MONADNOC,"Old cradle, hunting-ground and bier"
2308,MONADNOC,"Of wolf and otter, bear and deer;"
2309,MONADNOC,Well-built abode of many a race;
2310,MONADNOC,Tower of observance searching space;
2311,MONADNOC,Factory of river and of rain;
2312,MONADNOC,Link in the Alps' globe-girding chain;
2313,MONADNOC,By million changes skilled to tell
2314,MONADNOC,"What in the Eternal standeth well,"
2315,MONADNOC,And what obedient Nature can;--
2316,MONADNOC,Is this colossal talisman
2317,MONADNOC,"Kindly to plant and blood and kind,"
2318,MONADNOC,But speechless to the master's mind?
2319,MONADNOC,I thought to find the patriots
2320,MONADNOC,In whom the stock of freedom roots;
2321,MONADNOC,To myself I oft recount
2322,MONADNOC,"Tales of many a famous mount,--"
2323,MONADNOC,"Wales, Scotland, Uri, Hungary's dells:"
2324,MONADNOC,"Bards, Roys, Scanderbegs and Tells;"
2325,MONADNOC,And think how Nature in these towers
2326,MONADNOC,"Uplifted shall condense her powers,"
2327,MONADNOC,And lifting man to the blue deep
2328,MONADNOC,"Where stars their perfect courses keep,"
2329,MONADNOC,"Like wise preceptor, lure his eye"
2330,MONADNOC,"To sound the science of the sky,"
2331,MONADNOC,And carry learning to its height
2332,MONADNOC,Of untried power and sane delight:
2333,MONADNOC,"The Indian cheer, the frosty skies,"
2334,MONADNOC,"Rear purer wits, inventive eyes,--"
2335,MONADNOC,"Eyes that frame cities where none be,"
2336,MONADNOC,And hands that stablish what these see:
2337,MONADNOC,And by the moral of his place
2338,MONADNOC,Hint summits of heroic grace;
2339,MONADNOC,Man in these crags a fastness find
2340,MONADNOC,To fight pollution of the mind;
2341,MONADNOC,"In the wide thaw and ooze of wrong,"
2342,MONADNOC,"Adhere like this foundation strong,"
2343,MONADNOC,The insanity of towns to stem
2344,MONADNOC,With simpleness for stratagem.
2345,MONADNOC,"But if the brave old mould is broke,"
2346,MONADNOC,And end in churls the mountain folk
2347,MONADNOC,"In tavern cheer and tavern joke,"
2348,MONADNOC,"Sink, O mountain, in the swamp!"
2349,MONADNOC,"Hide in thy skies, O sovereign lamp!"
2350,MONADNOC,"Perish like leaves, the highland breed"
2351,MONADNOC,"No sire survive, no son succeed!"
2352,MONADNOC,
2353,MONADNOC,Soft! let not the offended muse
2354,MONADNOC,Toil's hard hap with scorn accuse.
2355,MONADNOC,"Many hamlets sought I then,"
2356,MONADNOC,Many farms of mountain men.
2357,MONADNOC,Rallying round a parish steeple
2358,MONADNOC,"Nestle warm the highland people,"
2359,MONADNOC,"Coarse and boisterous, yet mild,"
2360,MONADNOC,"Strong as giant, slow as child."
2361,MONADNOC,"Sweat and season are their arts,"
2362,MONADNOC,Their talismans are ploughs and carts;
2363,MONADNOC,And well the youngest can command
2364,MONADNOC,Honey from the frozen land;
2365,MONADNOC,"With cloverheads the swamp adorn,"
2366,MONADNOC,Change the running sand to corn;
2367,MONADNOC,"For wolf and fox, bring lowing herds,"
2368,MONADNOC,"And for cold mosses, cream and curds:"
2369,MONADNOC,Weave wood to canisters and mats;
2370,MONADNOC,Drain sweet maple juice in vats.
2371,MONADNOC,No bird is safe that cuts the air
2372,MONADNOC,From their rifle or their snare;
2373,MONADNOC,"No fish, in river or in lake,"
2374,MONADNOC,But their long hands it thence will take;
2375,MONADNOC,"Whilst the country's flinty face,"
2376,MONADNOC,"Like wax, their fashioning skill betrays,"
2377,MONADNOC,"To fill the hollows, sink the hills,"
2378,MONADNOC,"Bridge gulfs, drain swamps, build dams and mills,"
2379,MONADNOC,And fit the bleak and howling waste
2380,MONADNOC,"For homes of virtue, sense and taste."
2381,MONADNOC,"The World-soul knows his own affair,"
2382,MONADNOC,"Forelooking, when he would prepare"
2383,MONADNOC,"For the next ages, men of mould"
2384,MONADNOC,"Well embodied, well ensouled,"
2385,MONADNOC,"He cools the present's fiery glow,"
2386,MONADNOC,Sets the life-pulse strong but slow:
2387,MONADNOC,Bitter winds and fasts austere
2388,MONADNOC,"His quarantines and grottoes, where"
2389,MONADNOC,"He slowly cures decrepit flesh,"
2390,MONADNOC,And brings it infantile and fresh.
2391,MONADNOC,Toil and tempest are the toys
2392,MONADNOC,And games to breathe his stalwart boys:
2393,MONADNOC,"They bide their time, and well can prove,"
2394,MONADNOC,"If need were, their line from Jove;"
2395,MONADNOC,"Of the same stuff, and so allayed,"
2396,MONADNOC,"As that whereof the sun is made,"
2397,MONADNOC,"And of the fibre, quick and strong,"
2398,MONADNOC,"Whose throbs are love, whose thrills are song."
2399,MONADNOC,
2400,MONADNOC,"Now in sordid weeds they sleep,"
2401,MONADNOC,In dulness now their secret keep;
2402,MONADNOC,"Yet, will you learn our ancient speech,"
2403,MONADNOC,These the masters who can teach.
2404,MONADNOC,Fourscore or a hundred words
2405,MONADNOC,All their vocal muse affords;
2406,MONADNOC,But they turn them in a fashion
2407,MONADNOC,Past clerks' or statesmen's art or passion.
2408,MONADNOC,"I can spare the college bell,"
2409,MONADNOC,"And the learned lecture, well;"
2410,MONADNOC,"Spare the clergy and libraries,"
2411,MONADNOC,"Institutes and dictionaries,"
2412,MONADNOC,For that hardy English root
2413,MONADNOC,"Thrives here, unvalued, underfoot."
2414,MONADNOC,"Rude poets of the tavern hearth,"
2415,MONADNOC,"Squandering your unquoted mirth,"
2416,MONADNOC,"Which keeps the ground and never soars,"
2417,MONADNOC,While Jake retorts and Reuben roars;
2418,MONADNOC,"Scoff of yeoman strong and stark,"
2419,MONADNOC,Goes like bullet to its mark;
2420,MONADNOC,While the solid curse and jeer
2421,MONADNOC,Never balk the waiting ear.
2422,MONADNOC,
2423,MONADNOC,"On the summit as I stood,"
2424,MONADNOC,O'er the floor of plain and flood
2425,MONADNOC,"Seemed to me, the towering hill"
2426,MONADNOC,"Was not altogether still,"
2427,MONADNOC,But a quiet sense conveyed:
2428,MONADNOC,"If I err not, thus it said:--"
2429,MONADNOC,
2430,MONADNOC,"'Many feet in summer seek,"
2431,MONADNOC,"Oft, my far-appearing peak;"
2432,MONADNOC,"In the dreaded winter time,"
2433,MONADNOC,"None save dappling shadows climb,"
2434,MONADNOC,"Under clouds, my lonely head,"
2435,MONADNOC,"Old as the sun, old almost as the shade;"
2436,MONADNOC,And comest thou
2437,MONADNOC,"To see strange forests and new snow,"
2438,MONADNOC,And tread uplifted land?
2439,MONADNOC,"And leavest thou thy lowland race,"
2440,MONADNOC,Here amid clouds to stand?
2441,MONADNOC,And wouldst be my companion
2442,MONADNOC,"Where I gaze, and still shall gaze,"
2443,MONADNOC,"Through tempering nights and flashing days,"
2444,MONADNOC,"When forests fall, and man is gone,"
2445,MONADNOC,"Over tribes and over times,"
2446,MONADNOC,"At the burning Lyre,"
2447,MONADNOC,"Nearing me,"
2448,MONADNOC,"With its stars of northern fire,"
2449,MONADNOC,In many a thousand years?
2450,MONADNOC,
2451,MONADNOC,"'Gentle pilgrim, if thou know"
2452,MONADNOC,"The gamut old of Pan,"
2453,MONADNOC,"And how the hills began,"
2454,MONADNOC,The frank blessings of the hill
2455,MONADNOC,"Fall on thee, as fall they will."
2456,MONADNOC,
2457,MONADNOC,'Let him heed who can and will;
2458,MONADNOC,Enchantment fixed me here
2459,MONADNOC,"To stand the hurts of time, until"
2460,MONADNOC,In mightier chant I disappear.
2461,MONADNOC,If thou trowest
2462,MONADNOC,"How the chemic eddies play,"
2463,MONADNOC,"Pole to pole, and what they say;"
2464,MONADNOC,And that these gray crags
2465,MONADNOC,"Not on crags are hung,"
2466,MONADNOC,But beads are of a rosary
2467,MONADNOC,On prayer and music strung;
2468,MONADNOC,"And, credulous, through the granite seeming,"
2469,MONADNOC,Seest the smile of Reason beaming;--
2470,MONADNOC,Can thy style-discerning eye
2471,MONADNOC,"The hidden-working Builder spy,"
2472,MONADNOC,"Who builds, yet makes no chips, no din,"
2473,MONADNOC,With hammer soft as snowflake's flight;--
2474,MONADNOC,Knowest thou this?
2475,MONADNOC,"O pilgrim, wandering not amiss!"
2476,MONADNOC,"Already my rocks lie light,"
2477,MONADNOC,And soon my cone will spin.
2478,MONADNOC,
2479,MONADNOC,"'For the world was built in order,"
2480,MONADNOC,And the atoms march in tune;
2481,MONADNOC,"Rhyme the pipe, and Time the warder,"
2482,MONADNOC,The sun obeys them and the moon.
2483,MONADNOC,"Orb and atom forth they prance,"
2484,MONADNOC,When they hear from far the rune;
2485,MONADNOC,"None so backward in the troop,"
2486,MONADNOC,When the music and the dance
2487,MONADNOC,"Reach his place and circumstance,"
2488,MONADNOC,"But knows the sun-creating sound,"
2489,MONADNOC,"And, though a pyramid, will bound."
2490,MONADNOC,
2491,MONADNOC,"'Monadnoc is a mountain strong,"
2492,MONADNOC,Tall and good my kind among;
2493,MONADNOC,"But well I know, no mountain can,"
2494,MONADNOC,"Zion or Meru, measure with man."
2495,MONADNOC,"For it is on zodiacs writ,"
2496,MONADNOC,Adamant is soft to wit:
2497,MONADNOC,And when the greater comes again
2498,MONADNOC,"With my secret in his brain,"
2499,MONADNOC,"I shall pass, as glides my shadow"
2500,MONADNOC,Daily over hill and meadow.
2501,MONADNOC,
2502,MONADNOC,"'Through all time, in light, in gloom"
2503,MONADNOC,Well I hear the approaching feet
2504,MONADNOC,On the flinty pathway beat
2505,MONADNOC,"Of him that cometh, and shall come;"
2506,MONADNOC,Of him who shall as lightly bear
2507,MONADNOC,"My daily load of woods and streams,"
2508,MONADNOC,As doth this round sky-cleaving boat
2509,MONADNOC,Which never strains its rocky beams;
2510,MONADNOC,"Whose timbers, as they silent float,"
2511,MONADNOC,"Alps and Caucasus uprear,"
2512,MONADNOC,"And the long Alleghanies here,"
2513,MONADNOC,"And all town-sprinkled lands that be,"
2514,MONADNOC,Sailing through stars with all their history.
2515,MONADNOC,
2516,MONADNOC,"'Every morn I lift my head,"
2517,MONADNOC,"See New England underspread,"
2518,MONADNOC,"South from Saint Lawrence to the Sound,"
2519,MONADNOC,From Katskill east to the sea-bound.
2520,MONADNOC,"Anchored fast for many an age,"
2521,MONADNOC,"I await the bard and sage,"
2522,MONADNOC,"Who, in large thoughts, like fair pearl-seed,"
2523,MONADNOC,Shall string Monadnoc like a bead.
2524,MONADNOC,"Comes that cheerful troubadour,"
2525,MONADNOC,"This mound shall throb his face before,"
2526,MONADNOC,"As when, with inward fires and pain,"
2527,MONADNOC,It rose a bubble from the plain.
2528,MONADNOC,"When he cometh, I shall shed,"
2529,MONADNOC,"From this wellspring in my head,"
2530,MONADNOC,Fountain-drop of spicier worth
2531,MONADNOC,Than all vintage of the earth.
2532,MONADNOC,There's fruit upon my barren soil
2533,MONADNOC,Costlier far than wine or oil.
2534,MONADNOC,"There's a berry blue and gold,--"
2535,MONADNOC,"Autumn-ripe, its juices hold"
2536,MONADNOC,"Sparta's stoutness, Bethlehem's heart,"
2537,MONADNOC,"Asia's rancor, Athens' art,"
2538,MONADNOC,"Slowsure Britain's secular might,"
2539,MONADNOC,And the German's inward sight.
2540,MONADNOC,I will give my son to eat
2541,MONADNOC,"Best of Pan's immortal meat,"
2542,MONADNOC,"Bread to eat, and juice to drain;"
2543,MONADNOC,So the coinage of his brain
2544,MONADNOC,"Shall not be forms of stars, but stars,"
2545,MONADNOC,"Nor pictures pale, but Jove and Mars,"
2546,MONADNOC,"He comes, but not of that race bred"
2547,MONADNOC,Who daily climb my specular head.
2548,MONADNOC,"Oft as morning wreathes my scarf,"
2549,MONADNOC,"Fled the last plumule of the Dark,"
2550,MONADNOC,Pants up hither the spruce clerk
2551,MONADNOC,From South Cove and City Wharf.
2552,MONADNOC,"I take him up my rugged sides,"
2553,MONADNOC,"Half-repentant, scant of breath,--"
2554,MONADNOC,"Bead-eyes my granite chaos show,"
2555,MONADNOC,And my midsummer snow:
2556,MONADNOC,"Open the daunting map beneath,--"
2557,MONADNOC,"All his county, sea and land,"
2558,MONADNOC,Dwarfed to measure of his hand;
2559,MONADNOC,"His day's ride is a furlong space,"
2560,MONADNOC,His city-tops a glimmering haze.
2561,MONADNOC,I plant his eyes on the sky-hoop bounding;
2562,MONADNOC,"""See there the grim gray rounding"
2563,MONADNOC,Of the bullet of the earth
2564,MONADNOC,"Whereon ye sail,"
2565,MONADNOC,Tumbling steep
2566,MONADNOC,"In the uncontinented deep."""
2567,MONADNOC,"He looks on that, and he turns pale."
2568,MONADNOC,"'T is even so, this treacherous kite,"
2569,MONADNOC,"Farm-furrowed, town-incrusted sphere,"
2570,MONADNOC,"Thoughtless of its anxious freight,"
2571,MONADNOC,Plunges eyeless on forever;
2572,MONADNOC,"And he, poor parasite,"
2573,MONADNOC,"Cooped in a ship he cannot steer,--"
2574,MONADNOC,"Who is the captain he knows not,"
2575,MONADNOC,"Port or pilot trows not,--"
2576,MONADNOC,Risk or ruin he must share.
2577,MONADNOC,"I scowl on him with my cloud,"
2578,MONADNOC,With my north wind chill his blood;
2579,MONADNOC,"I lame him, clattering down the rocks;"
2580,MONADNOC,And to live he is in fear.
2581,MONADNOC,"Then, at last, I let him down"
2582,MONADNOC,"Once more into his dapper town,"
2583,MONADNOC,"To chatter, frightened, to his clan"
2584,MONADNOC,And forget me if he can.'
2585,MONADNOC,
2586,MONADNOC,As in the old poetic fame
2587,MONADNOC,"The gods are blind and lame,"
2588,MONADNOC,And the simular despite
2589,MONADNOC,"Betrays the more abounding might,"
2590,MONADNOC,So call not waste that barren cone
2591,MONADNOC,"Above the floral zone,"
2592,MONADNOC,Where forests starve:
2593,MONADNOC,It is pure use;--
2594,MONADNOC,What sheaves like those which here we glean and bind
2595,MONADNOC,Of a celestial Ceres and the Muse?
2596,MONADNOC,
2597,MONADNOC,"Ages are thy days,"
2598,MONADNOC,"Thou grand affirmer of the present tense,"
2599,MONADNOC,And type of permanence!
2600,MONADNOC,"Firm ensign of the fatal Being,"
2601,MONADNOC,"Amid these coward shapes of joy and grief,"
2602,MONADNOC,That will not bide the seeing!
2603,MONADNOC,
2604,MONADNOC,Hither we bring
2605,MONADNOC,Our insect miseries to thy rocks;
2606,MONADNOC,"And the whole flight, with folded wing,"
2607,MONADNOC,"Vanish, and end their murmuring,--"
2608,MONADNOC,"Vanish beside these dedicated blocks,"
2609,MONADNOC,Which who can tell what mason laid?
2610,MONADNOC,"Spoils of a front none need restore,"
2611,MONADNOC,Replacing frieze and architrave;--
2612,MONADNOC,Where flowers each stone rosette and metope brave;
2613,MONADNOC,Still is the haughty pile erect
2614,MONADNOC,Of the old building Intellect.
2615,MONADNOC,
2616,MONADNOC,"Complement of human kind,"
2617,MONADNOC,"Holding us at vantage still,"
2618,MONADNOC,"Our sumptuous indigence,"
2619,MONADNOC,"O barren mound, thy plenties fill!"
2620,MONADNOC,We fool and prate;
2621,MONADNOC,Thou art silent and sedate.
2622,MONADNOC,To myriad kinds and times one sense
2623,MONADNOC,The constant mountain doth dispense;
2624,MONADNOC,"Shedding on all its snows and leaves,"
2625,MONADNOC,"One joy it joys, one grief it grieves."
2626,MONADNOC,"Thou seest, O watchman tall,"
2627,MONADNOC,"Our towns and races grow and fall,"
2628,MONADNOC,And imagest the stable good
2629,MONADNOC,"For which we all our lifetime grope,"
2630,MONADNOC,"In shifting form the formless mind,"
2631,MONADNOC,"And though the substance us elude,"
2632,MONADNOC,We in thee the shadow find.
2633,MONADNOC,"Thou, in our astronomy"
2634,MONADNOC,"An opaker star,"
2635,MONADNOC,"Seen haply from afar,"
2636,MONADNOC,"Above the horizon's hoop,"
2637,MONADNOC,"A moment, by the railway troop,"
2638,MONADNOC,"As o'er some bolder height they speed,--"
2639,MONADNOC,"By circumspect ambition,"
2640,MONADNOC,"By errant gain,"
2641,MONADNOC,"By feasters and the frivolous,--"
2642,MONADNOC,"Recallest us,"
2643,MONADNOC,And makest sane.
2644,MONADNOC,"Mute orator! well skilled to plead,"
2645,MONADNOC,"And send conviction without phrase,"
2646,MONADNOC,Thou dost succor and remede
2647,MONADNOC,"The shortness of our days,"

2649,MONADNOC,Long morrow to this mortal youth.

3565,I. THE INITIAL LOVE,But word and wisdom is a snare;
3566,I. THE INITIAL LOVE,Corrupted by the present toy
3567,I. THE INITIAL LOVE,"He follows joy, and only joy."
3568,I. THE INITIAL LOVE,There is no mask but he will wear;
3569,I. THE INITIAL LOVE,He invented oaths to swear;
3570,I. THE INITIAL LOVE,"He paints, he carves, he chants, he prays,"
3571,I. THE INITIAL LOVE,And holds all stars in his embrace.
3572,I. THE INITIAL LOVE,He takes a sovran privilege
3573,I. THE INITIAL LOVE,Not allowed to any liege;
3574,I. THE INITIAL LOVE,"For Cupid goes behind all law,"

3588,I. THE INITIAL LOVE,"Piques, reproaches, hurts, caresses."
3589,I. THE INITIAL LOVE,"He will preach like a friar,"
3590,I. THE INITIAL LOVE,And jump like Harlequin;
3591,I. THE INITIAL LOVE,"He will read like a crier,"
3592,I. THE INITIAL LOVE,And fight like a Paladin.
3593,I. THE INITIAL LOVE,Boundless is his memory;
3594,I. THE INITIAL LOVE,Plans immense his term prolong;
3595,I. THE INITIAL LOVE,"He is not of counted age,"
3596,I. THE INITIAL LOVE,Meaning always to be young.
3597,I. THE INITIAL LOVE,"And his wish is intimacy,"
3598,I. THE INITIAL LOVE,"Intimater intimacy,"
3599,I. THE INITIAL LOVE,And a stricter privacy;
3600,I. THE INITIAL LOVE,"The impossible shall yet be done,"
3601,I. THE INITIAL LOVE,"And, being two, shall still be one."
3602,I. THE INITIAL LOVE,"As the wave breaks to foam on shelves,"

4178,THE HOUSE,"In many lands, with painful steps,"
4179,THE HOUSE,Ere she can find a tree.
4180,THE HOUSE,
4181,THE HOUSE,She ransacks mines and ledges

4213,SAADI,"Annexed a warning, poets say,"

4222,SAADI,"Though there come a million,"
4223,SAADI,Wise Saadi dwells alone.
4224,SAADI,
4225,SAADI,"Yet Saadi loved the race of men,--"
4226,SAADI,"No churl, immured in cave or den;"
4227,SAADI,In bower and hall
4228,SAADI,"He wants them all,"
4229,SAADI,Nor can dispense
4230,SAADI,With Persia for his audience;
4231,SAADI,"They must give ear,"

4240,SAADI,Gladly round that golden lamp
4241,SAADI,"Sylvan deities encamp,"

4243,SAADI,Are welcome to the man of truth.
4244,SAADI,"Most welcome they who need him most,"
4245,SAADI,They feed the spring which they exhaust;
4246,SAADI,For greater need

4248,SAADI,"But, critic, spare thy vanity,"

4250,SAADI,To vex with odious subtlety
4251,SAADI,The cheerer of men's hearts.

4253,SAADI,Sad-eyed Fakirs swiftly say
4254,SAADI,"Endless dirges to decay,"
4255,SAADI,Never in the blaze of light

4257,SAADI,Pale at overflowing noon
4258,SAADI,Hear wolves barking at the moon;
4259,SAADI,In the bower of dalliance sweet
4260,SAADI,Hear the far Avenger's feet:
4261,SAADI,"And shake before those awful Powers,"
4262,SAADI,Who in their pride forgive not ours.
4263,SAADI,Thus the sad-eyed Fakirs preach:
4264,SAADI,"'Bard, when thee would Allah teach,"
4265,SAADI,"And lift thee to his holy mount,"
4266,SAADI,He sends thee from his bitter fount
4267,SAADI,"Wormwood,--saying, ""Go thy ways;"
4268,SAADI,"Drink not the Malaga of praise,"
4269,SAADI,"But do the deed thy fellows hate,"
4270,SAADI,And compromise thy peaceful state;
4271,SAADI,Smite the white breasts which thee fed.
4272,SAADI,Stuff sharp thorns beneath the head
4273,SAADI,Of them thou shouldst have comforted;
4274,SAADI,For out of woe and out of crime
4275,SAADI,"Draws the heart a lore sublime.""'"
4276,SAADI,And yet it seemeth not to me
4277,SAADI,That the high gods love tragedy;
4278,SAADI,"For Saadi sat in the sun,"
4279,SAADI,And thanks was his contrition;
4280,SAADI,"For haircloth and for bloody whips,"
4281,SAADI,Had active hands and smiling lips;
4282,SAADI,"And yet his runes he rightly read,"
4283,SAADI,And to his folk his message sped.
4284,SAADI,Sunshine in his heart transferred
4285,SAADI,"Lighted each transparent word,"
4286,SAADI,And well could honoring Persia learn
4287,SAADI,What Saadi wished to say;
4288,SAADI,For Saadi's nightly stars did burn
4289,SAADI,Brighter than Jami's day.
4290,SAADI,
4291,SAADI,Whispered the Muse in Saadi's cot:
4292,SAADI,"'O gentle Saadi, listen not,"
4293,SAADI,"Tempted by thy praise of wit,"
4294,SAADI,Or by thirst and appetite
4295,SAADI,"For the talents not thine own,"
4296,SAADI,To sons of contradiction.
4297,SAADI,"Never, son of eastern morning,"
4298,SAADI,"Follow falsehood, follow scorning."
4299,SAADI,"Denounce who will, who will deny,"
4300,SAADI,And pile the hills to scale the sky;
4301,SAADI,"Let theist, atheist, pantheist,"
4302,SAADI,"Define and wrangle how they list,"
4303,SAADI,"Fierce conserver, fierce destroyer,--"
4304,SAADI,"But thou, joy-giver and enjoyer,"
4305,SAADI,"Unknowing war, unknowing crime,"
4306,SAADI,"Gentle Saadi, mind thy rhyme;"
4307,SAADI,"Heed not what the brawlers say,"
4308,SAADI,Heed thou only Saadi's lay.
4309,SAADI,
4310,SAADI,'Let the great world bustle on
4311,SAADI,"With war and trade, with camp and town;"
4312,SAADI,A thousand men shall dig and eat;
4313,SAADI,At forge and furnace thousands sweat;
4314,SAADI,"And thousands sail the purple sea,"
4315,SAADI,"And give or take the stroke of war,"
4316,SAADI,Or crowd the market and bazaar;
4317,SAADI,"Oft shall war end, and peace return,"
4318,SAADI,"And cities rise where cities burn,"
4319,SAADI,"Ere one man my hill shall climb,"
4320,SAADI,Who can turn the golden rhyme.
4321,SAADI,"Let them manage how they may,"
4322,SAADI,Heed thou only Saadi's lay.
4323,SAADI,"Seek the living among the dead,--"
4324,SAADI,Man in man is imprisonèd;
4325,SAADI,"Barefooted Dervish is not poor,"
4326,SAADI,"If fate unlock his bosom's door,"
4327,SAADI,So that what his eye hath seen
4328,SAADI,"His tongue can paint as bright, as keen;"
4329,SAADI,And what his tender heart hath felt
4330,SAADI,With equal fire thy heart shalt melt.
4331,SAADI,"For, whom the Muses smile upon,"
4332,SAADI,"And touch with soft persuasion,"
4333,SAADI,His words like a storm-wind can bring
4334,SAADI,Terror and beauty on their wing;
4335,SAADI,In his every syllable
4336,SAADI,Lurketh Nature veritable;
4337,SAADI,"And though he speak in midnight dark,--"
4338,SAADI,"In heaven no star, on earth no spark,--"
4339,SAADI,Yet before the listener's eye
4340,SAADI,"Swims the world in ecstasy,"
4341,SAADI,"The forest waves, the morning breaks,"
4342,SAADI,"The pastures sleep, ripple the lakes,"
4343,SAADI,"Leaves twinkle, flowers like persons be,"
4344,SAADI,And life pulsates in rock or tree.
4345,SAADI,"Saadi, so far thy words shall reach:"
4346,SAADI,Suns rise and set in Saadi's speech!'
4347,SAADI,
4348,SAADI,And thus to Saadi said the Muse:
4349,SAADI,'Eat thou the bread which men refuse;
4350,SAADI,Flee from the goods which from thee flee;
4351,SAADI,"Seek nothing,--Fortune seeketh thee."
4352,SAADI,"Nor mount, nor dive; all good things keep"
4353,SAADI,The midway of the eternal deep.
4354,SAADI,Wish not to fill the isles with eyes
4355,SAADI,To fetch thee birds of paradise:
4356,SAADI,On thine orchard's edge belong
4357,SAADI,All the brags of plume and song;
4358,SAADI,Wise Ali's sunbright sayings pass
4359,SAADI,For proverbs in the market-place:
4360,SAADI,"Through mountains bored by regal art,"
4361,SAADI,Toil whistles as he drives his cart.
4362,SAADI,"Nor scour the seas, nor sift mankind,"
4363,SAADI,A poet or a friend to find:
4364,SAADI,"Behold, he watches at the door!"
4365,SAADI,Behold his shadow on the floor!
4366,SAADI,Open innumerable doors
4367,SAADI,The heaven where unveiled Allah pours
4368,SAADI,"The flood of truth, the flood of good,"
4369,SAADI,The Seraph's and the Cherub's food.
4370,SAADI,Those doors are men: the Pariah hind
4371,SAADI,Admits thee to the perfect Mind.
4372,SAADI,Seek not beyond thy cottage wall
4373,SAADI,Redeemers that can yield thee all:
4374,SAADI,While thou sittest at thy door
4375,SAADI,"On the desert's yellow floor,"
4376,SAADI,"Listening to the gray-haired crones,"
4377,SAADI,"Foolish gossips, ancient drones,"
4378,SAADI,"Saadi, see! they rise in stature"
4379,SAADI,"To the height of mighty Nature,"
4380,SAADI,And the secret stands revealed
4381,SAADI,"Fraudulent Time in vain concealed,--"
4382,SAADI,That blessed gods in servile masks
4383,SAADI,Plied for thee thy household tasks.'

4584,MUSKETAQUID,"And, like the chemist 'mid his loaded jars,"
4585,MUSKETAQUID,Draw from each stratum its adapted use
4586,MUSKETAQUID,To drug their crops or weapon their arts withal.
4587,MUSKETAQUID,"They turn the frost upon their chemic heap,"
4588,MUSKETAQUID,"They set the wind to winnow pulse and grain,"
4589,MUSKETAQUID,"They thank the spring-flood for its fertile slime,"
4590,MUSKETAQUID,"And, on cheap summit-levels of the snow,"

4597,MUSKETAQUID,The order regnant in the yeoman's brain.
4598,MUSKETAQUID,
4599,MUSKETAQUID,"What these strong masters wrote at large in miles,"
4600,MUSKETAQUID,I followed in small copy in my acre;
4601,MUSKETAQUID,For there's no rood has not a star above it;
4602,MUSKETAQUID,The cordial quality of pear or plum
4603,MUSKETAQUID,Ascends as gladly in a single tree
4604,MUSKETAQUID,As in broad orchards resonant with bees;
4605,MUSKETAQUID,"And every atom poises for itself,"
4606,MUSKETAQUID,And for the whole. The gentle deities
4607,MUSKETAQUID,"Showed me the lore of colors and of sounds,"
4608,MUSKETAQUID,The innumerable tenements of beauty.
4609,MUSKETAQUID,"The miracle of generative force,"
4610,MUSKETAQUID,Far-reaching concords of astronomy
4611,MUSKETAQUID,Felt in the plants and in the punctual birds;
4612,MUSKETAQUID,"Better, the linked purpose of the whole,"
4613,MUSKETAQUID,"And, chiefest prize, found I true liberty"
4614,MUSKETAQUID,In the glad home plain-dealing Nature gave.
4615,MUSKETAQUID,The polite found me impolite; the great
4616,MUSKETAQUID,"Would mortify me, but in vain; for still"
4617,MUSKETAQUID,"I am a willow of the wilderness,"
4618,MUSKETAQUID,Loving the wind that bent me. All my hurts
4619,MUSKETAQUID,"My garden spade can heal. A woodland walk,"
4620,MUSKETAQUID,"A quest of river-grapes, a mocking thrush,"
4621,MUSKETAQUID,"A wild-rose, or rock-loving columbine,"
4622,MUSKETAQUID,Salve my worst wounds.
4623,MUSKETAQUID,For thus the wood-gods murmured in my ear:
4624,MUSKETAQUID,'Dost love our manners? Canst thou silent lie?
4625,MUSKETAQUID,"Canst thou, thy pride forgot, like Nature pass"
4626,MUSKETAQUID,Into the winter night's extinguished mood?
4627,MUSKETAQUID,"Canst thou shine now, then darkle,"
4628,MUSKETAQUID,"And being latent, feel thyself no less?"
4629,MUSKETAQUID,"As, when the all-worshipped moon attracts the eye,"
4630,MUSKETAQUID,"The river, hill, stems, foliage are obscure,"
4631,MUSKETAQUID,"Yet envies none, none are unenviable.'"

4756,THRENODY,"I hearken for thy household cheer,"
4757,THRENODY,O eloquent child!
4758,THRENODY,"Whose voice, an equal messenger,"
4759,THRENODY,Conveyed thy meaning mild.
4760,THRENODY,What though the pains and joys
4761,THRENODY,Whereof it spoke were toys
4762,THRENODY,"Fitting his age and ken,"
4763,THRENODY,"Yet fairest dames and bearded men,"

4770,THRENODY,Still plotting how their hungry fear
4771,THRENODY,That winsome voice again might hear;
4772,THRENODY,For his lips could well pronounce
4773,THRENODY,Words that were persuasions.
4774,THRENODY,
4775,THRENODY,Gentlest guardians marked serene
4776,THRENODY,"His early hope, his liberal mien;"
4777,THRENODY,Took counsel from his guiding eyes

4779,THRENODY,"Ah, vainly do these eyes recall"
4780,THRENODY,"The school-march, each day's festival,"
4781,THRENODY,When every morn my bosom glowed
4782,THRENODY,To watch the convoy on the road;
4783,THRENODY,"The babe in willow wagon closed,"
4784,THRENODY,With rolling eyes and face composed;
4785,THRENODY,"With children forward and behind,"
4786,THRENODY,Like Cupids studiously inclined;

4788,THRENODY,"The centre of the troop allied,"

4795,THRENODY,From the window I look out
4796,THRENODY,"To mark thy beautiful parade,"
4797,THRENODY,Stately marching in cap and coat
4798,THRENODY,To some tune by fairies played;--
4799,THRENODY,A music heard by thee alone
4800,THRENODY,To works as noble led thee on.
4801,THRENODY,
4802,THRENODY,"Now Love and Pride, alas! in vain,"
4803,THRENODY,Up and down their glances strain.
4804,THRENODY,The painted sled stands where it stood;
4805,THRENODY,The kennel by the corded wood;
4806,THRENODY,His gathered sticks to stanch the wall
4807,THRENODY,"Of the snow-tower, when snow should fall;"
4808,THRENODY,"The ominous hole he dug in the sand,"
4809,THRENODY,And childhood's castles built or planned;
4810,THRENODY,"His daily haunts I well discern,--"
4811,THRENODY,"The poultry-yard, the shed, the barn,--"
4812,THRENODY,And every inch of garden ground
4813,THRENODY,"Paced by the blessed feet around,"
4814,THRENODY,From the roadside to the brook
4815,THRENODY,Whereinto he loved to look.
4816,THRENODY,Step the meek fowls where erst they ranged;
4817,THRENODY,The wintry garden lies unchanged;
4818,THRENODY,The brook into the stream runs on;
4819,THRENODY,But the deep-eyed boy is gone.
4820,THRENODY,
4821,THRENODY,"On that shaded day,"
4822,THRENODY,"Dark with more clouds than tempests are,"
4823,THRENODY,When thou didst yield thy innocent breath
4824,THRENODY,"In birdlike heavings unto death,"
4825,THRENODY,"Night came, and Nature had not thee;"
4826,THRENODY,"I said, 'We are mates in misery.'"
4827,THRENODY,The morrow dawned with needless glow;
4828,THRENODY,"Each snowbird chirped, each fowl must crow;"
4829,THRENODY,Each tramper started; but the feet
4830,THRENODY,Of the most beautiful and sweet
4831,THRENODY,Of human youth had left the hill
4832,THRENODY,"And garden,--they were bound and still."
4833,THRENODY,"There's not a sparrow or a wren,"
4834,THRENODY,"There's not a blade of autumn grain,"
4835,THRENODY,Which the four seasons do not tend
4836,THRENODY,And tides of life and increase lend;
4837,THRENODY,"And every chick of every bird,"
4838,THRENODY,And weed and rock-moss is preferred.
4839,THRENODY,O ostrich-like forgetfulness!
4840,THRENODY,O loss of larger in the less!
4841,THRENODY,"Was there no star that could be sent,"
4842,THRENODY,"No watcher in the firmament,"
4843,THRENODY,No angel from the countless host
4844,THRENODY,"That loiters round the crystal coast,"
4845,THRENODY,"Could stoop to heal that only child,"
4846,THRENODY,"Nature's sweet marvel undefiled,"
4847,THRENODY,"And keep the blossom of the earth,"
4848,THRENODY,Which all her harvests were not worth?
4849,THRENODY,"Not mine,--I never called thee mine,"
4850,THRENODY,"But Nature's heir,--if I repine,"
4851,THRENODY,And seeing rashly torn and moved
4852,THRENODY,"Not what I made, but what I loved,"
4853,THRENODY,Grow early old with grief that thou
4854,THRENODY,"Must to the wastes of Nature go,--"
4855,THRENODY,'T is because a general hope
4856,THRENODY,"Was quenched, and all must doubt and grope."
4857,THRENODY,For flattering planets seemed to say
4858,THRENODY,"This child should ills of ages stay,"
4859,THRENODY,"By wondrous tongue, and guided pen,"
4860,THRENODY,Bring the flown Muses back to men.
4861,THRENODY,"Perchance not he but Nature ailed,"
4862,THRENODY,The world and not the infant failed.
4863,THRENODY,It was not ripe yet to sustain
4864,THRENODY,"A genius of so fine a strain,"
4865,THRENODY,Who gazed upon the sun and moon
4866,THRENODY,"As if he came unto his own,"
4867,THRENODY,"And, pregnant with his grander thought,"
4868,THRENODY,Brought the old order into doubt.
4869,THRENODY,His beauty once their beauty tried;
4870,THRENODY,"They could not feed him, and he died,"
4871,THRENODY,"And wandered backward as in scorn,"
4872,THRENODY,To wait an aeon to be born.
4873,THRENODY,"Ill day which made this beauty waste,"
4874,THRENODY,"Plight broken, this high face defaced!"
4875,THRENODY,Some went and came about the dead;
4876,THRENODY,And some in books of solace read;
4877,THRENODY,Some to their friends the tidings say;
4878,THRENODY,"Some went to write, some went to pray;"
4879,THRENODY,"One tarried here, there hurried one;"
4880,THRENODY,But their heart abode with none.
4881,THRENODY,"Covetous death bereaved us all,"
4882,THRENODY,To aggrandize one funeral.
4883,THRENODY,The eager fate which carried thee
4884,THRENODY,Took the largest part of me:
4885,THRENODY,For this losing is true dying;
4886,THRENODY,"This is lordly man's down-lying,"
4887,THRENODY,"This his slow but sure reclining,"
4888,THRENODY,Star by star his world resigning.
4889,THRENODY,
4890,THRENODY,"O child of paradise,"
4891,THRENODY,"Boy who made dear his father's home,"
4892,THRENODY,In whose deep eyes
4893,THRENODY,"Men read the welfare of the times to come,"
4894,THRENODY,I am too much bereft.
4895,THRENODY,The world dishonored thou hast left.
4896,THRENODY,O truth's and nature's costly lie!
4897,THRENODY,O trusted broken prophecy!
4898,THRENODY,O richest fortune sourly crossed!
4899,THRENODY,"Born for the future, to the future lost!"
4900,THRENODY,
4901,THRENODY,"The deep Heart answered, 'Weepest thou?"
4902,THRENODY,Worthier cause for passion wild
4903,THRENODY,If I had not taken the child.
4904,THRENODY,"And deemest thou as those who pore,"
4905,THRENODY,"With aged eyes, short way before,--"
4906,THRENODY,Think'st Beauty vanished from the coast
4907,THRENODY,"Of matter, and thy darling lost?"
4908,THRENODY,"Taught he not thee--the man of eld,"
4909,THRENODY,Whose eyes within his eyes beheld
4910,THRENODY,Heaven's numerous hierarchy span
4911,THRENODY,The mystic gulf from God to man?
4912,THRENODY,To be alone wilt thou begin
4913,THRENODY,When worlds of lovers hem thee in?
4914,THRENODY,"To-morrow, when the masks shall fall"
4915,THRENODY,"That dizen Nature's carnival,"
4916,THRENODY,"The pure shall see by their own will,"
4917,THRENODY,"Which overflowing Love shall fill,"
4918,THRENODY,'T is not within the force of fate
4919,THRENODY,The fate-conjoined to separate.
4920,THRENODY,"But thou, my votary, weepest thou?"
4921,THRENODY,I gave thee sight--where is it now?
4922,THRENODY,I taught thy heart beyond the reach
4923,THRENODY,"Of ritual, bible, or of speech;"
4924,THRENODY,"Wrote in thy mind's transparent table,"
4925,THRENODY,As far as the incommunicable;

4928,THRENODY,"Past utterance, and past belief,"
4929,THRENODY,"And past the blasphemy of grief,"
4930,THRENODY,The mysteries of Nature's heart;
4931,THRENODY,"And though no Muse can these impart,"
4932,THRENODY,"Throb thine with Nature's throbbing breast,"
4933,THRENODY,And all is clear from east to west.
4934,THRENODY,
4935,THRENODY,'I came to thee as to a friend;
4936,THRENODY,"Dearest, to thee I did not send"

4938,THRENODY,"Innocence that matched the sky,"
4939,THRENODY,"Lovely locks, a form of wonder,"
4940,THRENODY,"Laughter rich as woodland thunder,"
4941,THRENODY,That thou might'st entertain apart
4942,THRENODY,The richest flowering of all art:
4943,THRENODY,"And, as the great all-loving Day"
4944,THRENODY,"Through smallest chambers takes its way,"
4945,THRENODY,That thou might'st break thy daily bread
4946,THRENODY,"With prophet, savior and head;"
4947,THRENODY,That thou might'st cherish for thine own
4948,THRENODY,"The riches of sweet Mary's Son,"
4949,THRENODY,"Boy-Rabbi, Israel's paragon."
4950,THRENODY,And thoughtest thou such guest
4951,THRENODY,Would in thy hall take up his rest?
4952,THRENODY,"Would rushing life forget her laws,"
4953,THRENODY,Fate's glowing revolution pause?
4954,THRENODY,High omens ask diviner guess;
4955,THRENODY,Not to be conned to tediousness
4956,THRENODY,And know my higher gifts unbind
4957,THRENODY,The zone that girds the incarnate mind.
4958,THRENODY,When the scanty shores are full
4959,THRENODY,"With Thought's perilous, whirling pool;"
4960,THRENODY,"When frail Nature can no more,"
4961,THRENODY,Then the Spirit strikes the hour:
4962,THRENODY,"My servant Death, with solving rite,"
4963,THRENODY,Pours finite into infinite.
4964,THRENODY,"Wilt thou freeze love's tidal flow,"
4965,THRENODY,Whose streams through Nature circling go?
4966,THRENODY,Nail the wild star to its track
4967,THRENODY,On the half-climbed zodiac?
4968,THRENODY,"Light is light which radiates,"
4969,THRENODY,"Blood is blood which circulates,"
4970,THRENODY,"Life is life which generates,"
4971,THRENODY,"And many-seeming life is one,--"
4972,THRENODY,Wilt thou transfix and make it none?
4973,THRENODY,Its onward force too starkly pent
4974,THRENODY,"In figure, bone and lineament?"
4975,THRENODY,"Wilt thou, uncalled, interrogate,"
4976,THRENODY,Talker! the unreplying Fate?
4977,THRENODY,Nor see the genius of the whole
4978,THRENODY,"Ascendant in the private soul,"

5001,THRENODY,Flowering grass and scented weeds;

5068,MAY-DAY,"Harp of the wind, or song of bird,"
5069,MAY-DAY,"Or vagrant booming of the air,"
5070,MAY-DAY,Voice of a meteor lost in day?
5071,MAY-DAY,Such tidings of the starry sphere

5093,MAY-DAY,
5094,MAY-DAY,"When late I walked, in earlier days,"
5095,MAY-DAY,All was stiff and stark;
5096,MAY-DAY,"Knee-deep snows choked all the ways,"
5097,MAY-DAY,In the sky no spark;
5098,MAY-DAY,"Firm-braced I sought my ancient woods,"
5099,MAY-DAY,Struggling through the drifted roads;
5100,MAY-DAY,"The whited desert knew me not,"
5101,MAY-DAY,Snow-ridges masked each darling spot;
5102,MAY-DAY,"The summer dells, by genius haunted,"
5103,MAY-DAY,One arctic moon had disenchanted.

5105,MAY-DAY,"By Fancy, ghastly spells undid."

5107,MAY-DAY,Swift cathedrals in the wild;
5108,MAY-DAY,The piny hosts were sheeted ghosts
5109,MAY-DAY,In the star-lit minster aisled.
5110,MAY-DAY,I found no joy: the icy wind
5111,MAY-DAY,Might rule the forest to his mind.
5112,MAY-DAY,Who would freeze on frozen lakes?
5113,MAY-DAY,"Back to books and sheltered home,"
5114,MAY-DAY,"And wood-fire flickering on the walls,"
5115,MAY-DAY,"To hear, when, 'mid our talk and games,"
5116,MAY-DAY,Without the baffled North-wind calls.
5117,MAY-DAY,But soft! a sultry morning breaks;

5133,MAY-DAY,"And speaks all languages the rose,"
5134,MAY-DAY,The wood-fly mocks with tiny voice
5135,MAY-DAY,The far halloo of human voice;
5136,MAY-DAY,The perfumed berry on the spray
5137,MAY-DAY,Smacks of faint memories far away.
5138,MAY-DAY,A subtle chain of countless rings
5139,MAY-DAY,"The next into the farthest brings,"
5140,MAY-DAY,"And, striving to be man, the worm"
5141,MAY-DAY,Mounts through all the spires of form.
5142,MAY-DAY,
5143,MAY-DAY,The caged linnet in the Spring
5144,MAY-DAY,"Hearkens for the choral glee,"
5145,MAY-DAY,When his fellows on the wing
5146,MAY-DAY,Migrate from the Southern Sea;
5147,MAY-DAY,"When trellised grapes their flowers unmask,"
5148,MAY-DAY,"And the new-born tendrils twine,"
5149,MAY-DAY,The old wine darkling in the cask
5150,MAY-DAY,"Feels the bloom on the living vine,"
5151,MAY-DAY,And bursts the hoops at hint of Spring:
5152,MAY-DAY,"And so, perchance, in Adam's race,"
5153,MAY-DAY,Of Eden's bower some dream-like trace
5154,MAY-DAY,"Survived the Flight and swam the Flood,"
5155,MAY-DAY,And wakes the wish in youngest blood
5156,MAY-DAY,"To tread the forfeit Paradise,"
5157,MAY-DAY,And feed once more the exile's eyes;
5158,MAY-DAY,And ever when the happy child
5159,MAY-DAY,"In May beholds the blooming wild,"
5160,MAY-DAY,"And hears in heaven the bluebird sing,"
5161,MAY-DAY,"'Onward,' he cries, 'your baskets bring,--"
5162,MAY-DAY,"In the next field is air more mild,"
5163,MAY-DAY,And o'er yon hazy crest is Eden's balmier spring.'
5164,MAY-DAY,
5165,MAY-DAY,"Not for a regiment's parade,"
5166,MAY-DAY,"Nor evil laws or rulers made,"
5167,MAY-DAY,"Blue Walden rolls its cannonade,"
5168,MAY-DAY,But for a lofty sign
5169,MAY-DAY,"Which the Zodiac threw,"
5170,MAY-DAY,That the bondage-days are told.
5171,MAY-DAY,And waters free as winds shall flow.
5172,MAY-DAY,Lo! how all the tribes combine
5173,MAY-DAY,To rout the flying foe.
5174,MAY-DAY,"See, every patriot oak-leaf throws"
5175,MAY-DAY,"His elfin length upon the snows,"
5176,MAY-DAY,"Not idle, since the leaf all day"
5177,MAY-DAY,"Draws to the spot the solar ray,"
5178,MAY-DAY,"Ere sunset quarrying inches down,"
5179,MAY-DAY,And halfway to the mosses brown;
5180,MAY-DAY,While the grass beneath the rime
5181,MAY-DAY,"Has hints of the propitious time,"
5182,MAY-DAY,And upward pries and perforates
5183,MAY-DAY,"Through the cold slab a thousand gates,"
5184,MAY-DAY,Till green lances peering through
5185,MAY-DAY,Bend happy in the welkin blue.
5186,MAY-DAY,
5187,MAY-DAY,"As we thaw frozen flesh with snow,"
5188,MAY-DAY,"So Spring will not her time forerun,"
5189,MAY-DAY,"Mix polar night with tropic glow,"
5190,MAY-DAY,"Nor cloy us with unshaded sun,"
5191,MAY-DAY,"Nor wanton skip with bacchic dance,"
5192,MAY-DAY,But she has the temperance
5193,MAY-DAY,"Of the gods, whereof she is one,--"
5194,MAY-DAY,Masks her treasury of heat
5195,MAY-DAY,Under east winds crossed with sleet.
5196,MAY-DAY,Plants and birds and humble creatures
5197,MAY-DAY,Well accept her rule austere;
5198,MAY-DAY,"Titan-born, to hardy natures"
5199,MAY-DAY,Cold is genial and dear.
5200,MAY-DAY,As Southern wrath to Northern right
5201,MAY-DAY,Is but straw to anthracite;
5202,MAY-DAY,"As in the day of sacrifice,"
5203,MAY-DAY,"When heroes piled the pyre,"
5204,MAY-DAY,The dismal Massachusetts ice
5205,MAY-DAY,"Burned more than others' fire,"
5206,MAY-DAY,So Spring guards with surface cold
5207,MAY-DAY,The garnered heat of ages old.
5208,MAY-DAY,"Hers to sow the seed of bread,"
5209,MAY-DAY,That man and all the kinds be fed;
5210,MAY-DAY,"And, when the sunlight fills the hours,"
5211,MAY-DAY,"Dissolves the crust, displays the flowers."
5212,MAY-DAY,
5213,MAY-DAY,"Beneath the calm, within the light,"
5214,MAY-DAY,A hid unruly appetite
5215,MAY-DAY,"Of swifter life, a surer hope,"
5216,MAY-DAY,"Strains every sense to larger scope,"
5217,MAY-DAY,Impatient to anticipate
5218,MAY-DAY,The halting steps of aged Fate.
5219,MAY-DAY,"Slow grows the palm, too slow the pearl:"
5220,MAY-DAY,"When Nature falters, fain would zeal"
5221,MAY-DAY,"Grasp the felloes of her wheel,"
5222,MAY-DAY,And grasping give the orbs another whirl.
5223,MAY-DAY,"Turn swiftlier round, O tardy ball!"
5224,MAY-DAY,And sun this frozen side.
5225,MAY-DAY,"Bring hither back the robin's call,"
5226,MAY-DAY,Bring back the tulip's pride.
5227,MAY-DAY,
5228,MAY-DAY,Why chidest thou the tardy Spring?
5229,MAY-DAY,The hardy bunting does not chide;
5230,MAY-DAY,The blackbirds make the maples ring
5231,MAY-DAY,With social cheer and jubilee;
5232,MAY-DAY,"The redwing flutes his _o-ka-lee_,"
5233,MAY-DAY,The robins know the melting snow;
5234,MAY-DAY,"The sparrow meek, prophetic-eyed,"
5235,MAY-DAY,"Her nest beside the snow-drift weaves,"
5236,MAY-DAY,Secure the osier yet will hide
5237,MAY-DAY,"Her callow brood in mantling leaves,--"
5238,MAY-DAY,"And thou, by science all undone,"
5239,MAY-DAY,Why only must thy reason fail
5240,MAY-DAY,To see the southing of the sun?
5241,MAY-DAY,
5242,MAY-DAY,"The world rolls round,--mistrust it not,--"
5243,MAY-DAY,Befalls again what once befell;
5244,MAY-DAY,"All things return, both sphere and mote,"
5245,MAY-DAY,"And I shall hear my bluebird's note,"
5246,MAY-DAY,And dream the dream of Auburn dell.
5247,MAY-DAY,
5248,MAY-DAY,April cold with dropping rain
5249,MAY-DAY,"Willows and lilacs brings again,"
5250,MAY-DAY,"The whistle of returning birds,"
5251,MAY-DAY,And trumpet-lowing of the herds.
5252,MAY-DAY,The scarlet maple-keys betray
5253,MAY-DAY,"What potent blood hath modest May,"
5254,MAY-DAY,"What fiery force the earth renews,"
5255,MAY-DAY,"The wealth of forms, the flush of hues;"
5256,MAY-DAY,What joy in rosy waves outpoured
5257,MAY-DAY,"Flows from the heart of Love, the Lord."
5258,MAY-DAY,
5259,MAY-DAY,Hither rolls the storm of heat;
5260,MAY-DAY,I feel its finer billows beat
5261,MAY-DAY,Like a sea which me infolds;
5262,MAY-DAY,"Heat with viewless fingers moulds,"
5263,MAY-DAY,"Swells, and mellows, and matures,"
5264,MAY-DAY,"Paints, and flavors, and allures,"
5265,MAY-DAY,"Bird and brier inly warms,"
5266,MAY-DAY,"Still enriches and transforms,"
5267,MAY-DAY,"Gives the reed and lily length,"
5268,MAY-DAY,"Adds to oak and oxen strength,"
5269,MAY-DAY,"Transforming what it doth infold,"
5270,MAY-DAY,"Life out of death, new out of old,"
5271,MAY-DAY,"Painting fawns' and leopards' fells,"
5272,MAY-DAY,"Seethes the gulf-encrimsoning shells,"
5273,MAY-DAY,Fires gardens with a joyful blaze
5274,MAY-DAY,"Of tulips, in the morning's rays."
5275,MAY-DAY,"The dead log touched bursts into leaf,"
5276,MAY-DAY,The wheat-blade whispers of the sheaf.
5277,MAY-DAY,"What god is this imperial Heat,"
5278,MAY-DAY,"Earth's prime secret, sculpture's seat?"
5279,MAY-DAY,Doth it bear hidden in its heart
5280,MAY-DAY,Water-line patterns of all art?
5281,MAY-DAY,Is it Daedalus? is it Love?
5282,MAY-DAY,"Or walks in mask almighty Jove,"
5283,MAY-DAY,And drops from Power's redundant horn
5284,MAY-DAY,All seeds of beauty to be born?
5285,MAY-DAY,
5286,MAY-DAY,"Where shall we keep the holiday,"
5287,MAY-DAY,And duly greet the entering May?
5288,MAY-DAY,"Too strait and low our cottage doors,"
5289,MAY-DAY,And all unmeet our carpet floors;
5290,MAY-DAY,"Nor spacious court, nor monarch's hall,"
5291,MAY-DAY,Suffice to hold the festival.
5292,MAY-DAY,Up and away! where haughty woods
5293,MAY-DAY,Front the liberated floods:
5294,MAY-DAY,"We will climb the broad-backed hills,"
5295,MAY-DAY,Hear the uproar of their joy;
5296,MAY-DAY,We will mark the leaps and gleams
5297,MAY-DAY,"Of the new-delivered streams,"
5298,MAY-DAY,And the murmuring rivers of sap
5299,MAY-DAY,"Mount in the pipes of the trees,"
5300,MAY-DAY,"Giddy with day, to the topmost spire,"
5301,MAY-DAY,Which for a spike of tender green
5302,MAY-DAY,Bartered its powdery cap;
5303,MAY-DAY,"And the colors of joy in the bird,"
5304,MAY-DAY,"And the love in its carol heard,"
5305,MAY-DAY,"Frog and lizard in holiday coats,"
5306,MAY-DAY,And turtle brave in his golden spots;
5307,MAY-DAY,While cheerful cries of crag and plain
5308,MAY-DAY,Reply to the thunder of river and main.
5309,MAY-DAY,
5310,MAY-DAY,As poured the flood of the ancient sea
5311,MAY-DAY,"Spilling over mountain chains,"
5312,MAY-DAY,"Bending forests as bends the sedge,"
5313,MAY-DAY,"Faster flowing o'er the plains,--"
5314,MAY-DAY,A world-wide wave with a foaming edge
5315,MAY-DAY,"That rims the running silver sheet,--"
5316,MAY-DAY,So pours the deluge of the heat
5317,MAY-DAY,"Broad northward o'er the land,"
5318,MAY-DAY,"Painting artless paradises,"
5319,MAY-DAY,"Drugging herbs with Syrian spices,"
5320,MAY-DAY,Fanning secret fires which glow
5321,MAY-DAY,"In columbine and clover-blow,"
5322,MAY-DAY,"Climbing the northern zones,"
5323,MAY-DAY,Where a thousand pallid towns
5324,MAY-DAY,"Lie like cockles by the main,"
5325,MAY-DAY,Or tented armies on a plain.
5326,MAY-DAY,The million-handed sculptor moulds
5327,MAY-DAY,"Quaintest bud and blossom folds,"
5328,MAY-DAY,The million-handed painter pours
5329,MAY-DAY,Opal hues and purple dye;
5330,MAY-DAY,"Azaleas flush the island floors,"
5331,MAY-DAY,And the tints of heaven reply.
5332,MAY-DAY,
5333,MAY-DAY,Wreaths for the May! for happy Spring
5334,MAY-DAY,"To-day shall all her dowry bring,"
5335,MAY-DAY,"The love of kind, the joy, the grace,"
5336,MAY-DAY,"Hymen of element and race,"
5337,MAY-DAY,Knowing well to celebrate
5338,MAY-DAY,"With song and hue and star and state,"
5339,MAY-DAY,"With tender light and youthful cheer,"
5340,MAY-DAY,The spousals of the new-born year.
5341,MAY-DAY,
5342,MAY-DAY,"Spring is strong and virtuous,"
5343,MAY-DAY,"Broad-sowing, cheerful, plenteous,"
5344,MAY-DAY,Quickening underneath the mould
5345,MAY-DAY,Grains beyond the price of gold.
5346,MAY-DAY,"So deep and large her bounties are,"
5347,MAY-DAY,"That one broad, long midsummer day"
5348,MAY-DAY,Shall to the planet overpay
5349,MAY-DAY,The ravage of a year of war.
5350,MAY-DAY,
5351,MAY-DAY,"Drug the cup, thou butler sweet,"
5352,MAY-DAY,And send the nectar round;
5353,MAY-DAY,The feet that slid so long on sleet
5354,MAY-DAY,Are glad to feel the ground.
5355,MAY-DAY,Fill and saturate each kind
5356,MAY-DAY,"With good according to its mind,"
5357,MAY-DAY,Fill each kind and saturate
5358,MAY-DAY,"With good agreeing with its fate,"
5359,MAY-DAY,And soft perfection of its plan--
5360,MAY-DAY,"Willow and violet, maiden and man."
5361,MAY-DAY,
5362,MAY-DAY,"The bitter-sweet, the haunting air"
5363,MAY-DAY,"Creepeth, bloweth everywhere;"
5364,MAY-DAY,"It preys on all, all prey on it."
5365,MAY-DAY,"Blooms in beauty, thinks in wit,"
5366,MAY-DAY,"Stings the strong with enterprise,"
5367,MAY-DAY,"Makes travellers long for Indian skies,"
5368,MAY-DAY,And where it comes this courier fleet
5369,MAY-DAY,"Fans in all hearts expectance sweet,"
5370,MAY-DAY,As if to-morrow should redeem
5371,MAY-DAY,The vanished rose of evening's dream.
5372,MAY-DAY,"By houses lies a fresher green,"
5373,MAY-DAY,"On men and maids a ruddier mien,"
5374,MAY-DAY,As if Time brought a new relay
5375,MAY-DAY,"Of shining virgins every May,"
5376,MAY-DAY,And Summer came to ripen maids
5377,MAY-DAY,To a beauty that not fades.
5378,MAY-DAY,
5379,MAY-DAY,"I saw the bud-crowned Spring go forth,"
5380,MAY-DAY,Stepping daily onward north
5381,MAY-DAY,To greet staid ancient cavaliers
5382,MAY-DAY,Filing single in stately train.
5383,MAY-DAY,"And who, and who are the travellers?"
5384,MAY-DAY,"They were Night and Day, and Day and Night,"
5385,MAY-DAY,Pilgrims wight with step forthright.
5386,MAY-DAY,"I saw the Days deformed and low,"
5387,MAY-DAY,Short and bent by cold and snow;
5388,MAY-DAY,"The merry Spring threw wreaths on them,"
5389,MAY-DAY,Flower-wreaths gay with bud and bell;
5390,MAY-DAY,"Many a flower and many a gem,"
5391,MAY-DAY,"They were refreshed by the smell,"
5392,MAY-DAY,"They shook the snow from hats and shoon,"
5393,MAY-DAY,They put their April raiment on;

5395,MAY-DAY,"Unhurt by a thousand storms,"
5396,MAY-DAY,"Shot up to the height of the sky again,"
5397,MAY-DAY,And danced as merrily as young men.
5398,MAY-DAY,I saw them mask their awful glance
5399,MAY-DAY,Sidewise meek in gossamer lids;
5400,MAY-DAY,And to speak my thought if none forbids
5401,MAY-DAY,"It was as if the eternal gods,"
5402,MAY-DAY,"Tired of their starry periods,"
5403,MAY-DAY,Hid their majesty in cloth
5404,MAY-DAY,Woven of tulips and painted moth.
5405,MAY-DAY,On carpets green the maskers march
5406,MAY-DAY,"Below May's well-appointed arch,"

5412,MAY-DAY,
5413,MAY-DAY,"'Twas the vintage-day of field and wood,"
5414,MAY-DAY,When magic wine for bards is brewed;
5415,MAY-DAY,Every tree and stem and chink
5416,MAY-DAY,Gushed with syrup to the brink.
5417,MAY-DAY,"The air stole into the streets of towns,"
5418,MAY-DAY,"Refreshed the wise, reformed the clowns,"
5419,MAY-DAY,And betrayed the fund of joy
5420,MAY-DAY,To the high-school and medalled boy:
5421,MAY-DAY,"On from hall to chamber ran,"
5422,MAY-DAY,"From youth to maid, from boy to man,"
5423,MAY-DAY,"To babes, and to old eyes as well."
5424,MAY-DAY,"'Once more,' the old man cried, 'ye clouds,"
5425,MAY-DAY,"Airy turrets purple-piled,"
5426,MAY-DAY,"Which once my infancy beguiled,"
5427,MAY-DAY,Beguile me with the wonted spell.
5428,MAY-DAY,I know ye skilful to convoy
5429,MAY-DAY,The total freight of hope and joy
5430,MAY-DAY,"Into rude and homely nooks,"
5431,MAY-DAY,"Shed mocking lustres on shelf of books,"
5432,MAY-DAY,"On farmer's byre, on pasture rude,"
5433,MAY-DAY,And stony pathway to the wood.
5434,MAY-DAY,I care not if the pomps you show
5435,MAY-DAY,"Be what they soothfast appear,"
5436,MAY-DAY,Or if yon realms in sunset glow
5437,MAY-DAY,Be bubbles of the atmosphere.
5438,MAY-DAY,And if it be to you allowed
5439,MAY-DAY,"To fool me with a shining cloud,"
5440,MAY-DAY,So only new griefs are consoled
5441,MAY-DAY,"By new delights, as old by old,"
5442,MAY-DAY,"Frankly I will be your guest,"
5443,MAY-DAY,Count your change and cheer the best.
5444,MAY-DAY,"The world hath overmuch of pain,--"
5445,MAY-DAY,"If Nature give me joy again,"
5446,MAY-DAY,Of such deceit I'll not complain.'
5447,MAY-DAY,
5448,MAY-DAY,"Ah! well I mind the calendar,"
5449,MAY-DAY,"Faithful through a thousand years,"
5450,MAY-DAY,"Of the painted race of flowers,"
5451,MAY-DAY,"Exact to days, exact to hours,"
5452,MAY-DAY,Counted on the spacious dial
5453,MAY-DAY,Yon broidered zodiac girds.
5454,MAY-DAY,I know the trusty almanac
5455,MAY-DAY,"Of the punctual coming-back,"
5456,MAY-DAY,"On their due days, of the birds."
5457,MAY-DAY,"I marked them yestermorn,"
5458,MAY-DAY,A flock of finches darting
5459,MAY-DAY,"Beneath the crystal arch,"
5460,MAY-DAY,"Piping, as they flew, a march,--"
5461,MAY-DAY,Belike the one they used in parting
5462,MAY-DAY,Last year from yon oak or larch;
5463,MAY-DAY,"Dusky sparrows in a crowd,"
5464,MAY-DAY,"Diving, darting northward free,"
5465,MAY-DAY,"Suddenly betook them all,"
5466,MAY-DAY,"Every one to his hole in the wall,"
5467,MAY-DAY,Or to his niche in the apple-tree.
5468,MAY-DAY,I greet with joy the choral trains
5469,MAY-DAY,Fresh from palms and Cuba's canes.
5470,MAY-DAY,"Best gems of Nature's cabinet,"
5471,MAY-DAY,"With dews of tropic morning wet,"
5472,MAY-DAY,"Beloved of children, bards and Spring,"
5473,MAY-DAY,"O birds, your perfect virtues bring,"

5480,MAY-DAY,"And, generous, teach his awkward race"
5481,MAY-DAY,Courage and probity and grace!

5483,MAY-DAY,Poets praise that hidden wine
5484,MAY-DAY,Hid in milk we drew
5485,MAY-DAY,"At the barrier of Time,"
5486,MAY-DAY,When our life was new.
5487,MAY-DAY,"We had eaten fairy fruit,"
5488,MAY-DAY,"We were quick from head to foot,"

5490,MAY-DAY,As with diamond dews thereon.
5491,MAY-DAY,"What cared we for costly joys,"
5492,MAY-DAY,The Museum's far-fetched toys?
5493,MAY-DAY,Gleam of sunshine on the wall
5494,MAY-DAY,Poured a deeper cheer than all
5495,MAY-DAY,The revels of the Carnival.
5496,MAY-DAY,We a pine-grove did prefer
5497,MAY-DAY,"To a marble theatre,"
5498,MAY-DAY,"Could with gods on mallows dine,"
5499,MAY-DAY,Nor cared for spices or for wine.
5500,MAY-DAY,Wreaths of mist and rainbow spanned.

5511,MAY-DAY,"Or shouting boys that chase their ball,"
5512,MAY-DAY,"Pass the height of minstrel skill,"
5513,MAY-DAY,"But the ploughman's thoughtless cry,"
5514,MAY-DAY,"Lowing oxen, sheep that bleat,"
5515,MAY-DAY,"And the joiner's hammer-beat,"
5516,MAY-DAY,"Softened are above their will,"
5517,MAY-DAY,Take tones from groves they wandered through
5518,MAY-DAY,Or flutes which passing angels blew.
5519,MAY-DAY,"All grating discords melt,"
5520,MAY-DAY,"No dissonant note is dealt,"
5521,MAY-DAY,And though thy voice be shrill
5522,MAY-DAY,"Like rasping file on steel,"

5533,MAY-DAY,Smothering in her ample breast
5534,MAY-DAY,"All but godlike words,"
5535,MAY-DAY,Reporting to the happy ear
5536,MAY-DAY,Only purified accords.
5537,MAY-DAY,"Strangely wrought from barking waves,"
5538,MAY-DAY,"Soft music daunts the Indian braves,--"
5539,MAY-DAY,Convent-chanting which the child
5540,MAY-DAY,Hears pealing from the panther's cave
5541,MAY-DAY,And the impenetrable wild.
5542,MAY-DAY,
5543,MAY-DAY,Soft on the South-wind sleeps the haze:

7109,THE TITMOUSE,And I began to catch the sense
7110,THE TITMOUSE,Of my bird's song: 'Live out of doors
7111,THE TITMOUSE,"In the great woods, on prairie floors."
7112,THE TITMOUSE,"I dine in the sun; when he sinks in the sea,"
7113,THE TITMOUSE,I too have a hole in a hollow tree;
7114,THE TITMOUSE,And I like less when Summer beats
7115,THE TITMOUSE,"With stifling beams on these retreats,"
7116,THE TITMOUSE,Than noontide twilights which snow makes
7117,THE TITMOUSE,With tempest of the blinding flakes.
7118,THE TITMOUSE,"For well the soul, if stout within,"
7119,THE TITMOUSE,Can arm impregnably the skin;
7120,THE TITMOUSE,"And polar frost my frame defied,"
7121,THE TITMOUSE,Made of the air that blows outside.'
7122,THE TITMOUSE,
7123,THE TITMOUSE,"With glad remembrance of my debt,"
7124,THE TITMOUSE,"I homeward turn; farewell, my pet!"
7125,THE TITMOUSE,"When here again thy pilgrim comes,"
7126,THE TITMOUSE,He shall bring store of seeds and crumbs.
7127,THE TITMOUSE,"Doubt not, so long as earth has bread,"
7128,THE TITMOUSE,Thou first and foremost shalt be fed;
7129,THE TITMOUSE,The Providence that is most large
7130,THE TITMOUSE,"Takes hearts like thine in special charge,"
7131,THE TITMOUSE,"Helps who for their own need are strong,"
7132,THE TITMOUSE,And the sky doats on cheerful song.
7133,THE TITMOUSE,Henceforth I prize thy wiry chant
7134,THE TITMOUSE,O'er all that mass and minster vaunt;
7135,THE TITMOUSE,"For men mis-hear thy call in Spring,"
7136,THE TITMOUSE,"As 't would accost some frivolous wing,"
7137,THE TITMOUSE,"Crying out of the hazel copse, _Phe-be!_"
7138,THE TITMOUSE,"And, in winter, _Chic-a-dee-dee!_"
7139,THE TITMOUSE,I think old Caesar must have heard
7140,THE TITMOUSE,"In northern Gaul my dauntless bird,"
7141,THE TITMOUSE,"And, echoed in some frosty wold,"
7142,THE TITMOUSE,Borrowed thy battle-numbers bold.
7143,THE TITMOUSE,"And I will write our annals new,"
7144,THE TITMOUSE,"And thank thee for a better clew,"
7145,THE TITMOUSE,"I, who dreamed not when I came here"
7146,THE TITMOUSE,"To find the antidote of fear,"
7147,THE TITMOUSE,"Now hear thee say in Roman key,"
7148,THE TITMOUSE,"_Paean! Veni, vidi, vici._"

7154,THE HARP,"One musician is sure,"
7155,THE HARP,"His wisdom will not fail,"
7156,THE HARP,"He has not tasted wine impure,"
7157,THE HARP,Nor bent to passion frail.
7158,THE HARP,"Age cannot cloud his memory,"
7159,THE HARP,"Nor grief untune his voice,"
7160,THE HARP,Ranging down the ruled scale
7161,THE HARP,"From tone of joy to inward wail,"
7162,THE HARP,Tempering the pitch of all
7163,THE HARP,In his windy cave.
7164,THE HARP,"He all the fables knows,"
7165,THE HARP,"And in their causes tells,--"
7166,THE HARP,"Knows Nature's rarest moods,"
7167,THE HARP,Ever on her secret broods.
7168,THE HARP,"The Muse of men is coy,"
7169,THE HARP,Oft courted will not come;
7170,THE HARP,In palaces and market squares
7171,THE HARP,"Entreated, she is dumb;"
7172,THE HARP,But my minstrel knows and tells
7173,THE HARP,"The counsel of the gods,"
7174,THE HARP,"Knows of Holy Book the spells,"
7175,THE HARP,"Knows the law of Night and Day,"
7176,THE HARP,"And the heart of girl and boy,"
7177,THE HARP,"The tragic and the gay,"
7178,THE HARP,And what is writ on Table Round
7179,THE HARP,Of Arthur and his peers;
7180,THE HARP,What sea and land discoursing say
7181,THE HARP,In sidereal years.
7182,THE HARP,He renders all his lore
7183,THE HARP,"In numbers wild as dreams,"
7184,THE HARP,"Modulating all extremes,--"
7185,THE HARP,What the spangled meadow saith
7186,THE HARP,To the children who have faith;
7187,THE HARP,"Only to children children sing,"
7188,THE HARP,Only to youth will spring be spring.
7189,THE HARP,
7190,THE HARP,Who is the Bard thus magnified?
7191,THE HARP,When did he sing? and where abide?
7192,THE HARP,
7193,THE HARP,Chief of song where poets feast
7194,THE HARP,Is the wind-harp which thou seest
7195,THE HARP,In the casement at my side.
7196,THE HARP,
7197,THE HARP,"Aeolian harp,"
7198,THE HARP,How strangely wise thy strain!
7199,THE HARP,"Gay for youth, gay for youth,"
7200,THE HARP,"(Sweet is art, but sweeter truth,)"
7201,THE HARP,In the hall at summer eve
7202,THE HARP,Fate and Beauty skilled to weave.
7203,THE HARP,From the eager opening strings
7204,THE HARP,Rung loud and bold the song.
7205,THE HARP,Who but loved the wind-harp's note?
7206,THE HARP,How should not the poet doat
7207,THE HARP,"On its mystic tongue,"
7208,THE HARP,"With its primeval memory,"
7209,THE HARP,Reporting what old minstrels told
7210,THE HARP,"Of Merlin locked the harp within,--"
7211,THE HARP,"Merlin paying the pain of sin,"
7212,THE HARP,"Pent in a dungeon made of air,--"
7213,THE HARP,"And some attain his voice to hear,"
7214,THE HARP,"Words of pain and cries of fear,"
7215,THE HARP,"But pillowed all on melody,"
7216,THE HARP,As fits the griefs of bards to be.
7217,THE HARP,"And what if that all-echoing shell,"
7218,THE HARP,"Which thus the buried Past can tell,"
7219,THE HARP,"Should rive the Future, and reveal"
7220,THE HARP,What his dread folds would fain conceal?
7221,THE HARP,"It shares the secret of the earth,"
7222,THE HARP,And of the kinds that owe her birth.
7223,THE HARP,"Speaks not of self that mystic tone,"
7224,THE HARP,But of the Overgods alone:
7225,THE HARP,"It trembles to the cosmic breath,--"
7226,THE HARP,"As it heareth, so it saith;"
7227,THE HARP,"Obeying meek the primal Cause,"
7228,THE HARP,It is the tongue of mundane laws.
7229,THE HARP,"And this, at least, I dare affirm,"
7230,THE HARP,"Since genius too has bound and term,"
7231,THE HARP,"There is no bard in all the choir,"
7232,THE HARP,"Not Homer's self, the poet sire,"
7233,THE HARP,"Wise Milton's odes of pensive pleasure,"
7234,THE HARP,"Or Shakspeare, whom no mind can measure,"
7235,THE HARP,"Nor Collins' verse of tender pain,"
7236,THE HARP,"Nor Byron's clarion of disdain,"
7237,THE HARP,"Scott, the delight of generous boys,"
7238,THE HARP,"Or Wordsworth, Pan's recording voice,--"
7239,THE HARP,"Not one of all can put in verse,"
7240,THE HARP,Or to this presence could rehearse
7241,THE HARP,The sights and voices ravishing
7242,THE HARP,"The boy knew on the hills in spring,"
7243,THE HARP,When pacing through the oaks he heard
7244,THE HARP,"Sharp queries of the sentry-bird,"
7245,THE HARP,"The heavy grouse's sudden whir,"
7246,THE HARP,The rattle of the kingfisher;
7247,THE HARP,Saw bonfires of the harlot flies
7248,THE HARP,"In the lowland, when day dies;"
7249,THE HARP,"Or marked, benighted and forlorn,"
7250,THE HARP,The first far signal-fire of morn.
7251,THE HARP,"These syllables that Nature spoke,"
7252,THE HARP,"And the thoughts that in him woke,"
7253,THE HARP,Can adequately utter none
7254,THE HARP,Save to his ear the wind-harp lone.
7255,THE HARP,Therein I hear the Parcae reel
7256,THE HARP,"The threads of man at their humming wheel,"
7257,THE HARP,"The threads of life and power and pain,"
7258,THE HARP,So sweet and mournful falls the strain.
7259,THE HARP,And best can teach its Delphian chord
7260,THE HARP,"How Nature to the soul is moored,"
7261,THE HARP,"If once again that silent string,"
7262,THE HARP,"As erst it wont, would thrill and ring."
7263,THE HARP,
7264,THE HARP,"Not long ago at eventide,"
7265,THE HARP,"It seemed, so listening, at my side"
7266,THE HARP,"A window rose, and, to say sooth,"
7267,THE HARP,I looked forth on the fields of youth:
7268,THE HARP,"I saw fair boys bestriding steeds,"
7269,THE HARP,"I knew their forms in fancy weeds,"
7270,THE HARP,"Long, long concealed by sundering fates,"
7271,THE HARP,"Mates of my youth,--yet not my mates,"
7272,THE HARP,"Stronger and bolder far than I,"
7273,THE HARP,"With grace, with genius, well attired,"
7274,THE HARP,"And then as now from far admired,"
7275,THE HARP,Followed with love
7276,THE HARP,"They knew not of,"
7277,THE HARP,With passion cold and shy.
7278,THE HARP,"O joy, for what recoveries rare!"
7279,THE HARP,"Renewed, I breathe Elysian air,"
7280,THE HARP,"See youth's glad mates in earliest bloom,--"
7281,THE HARP,"Break not my dream, obtrusive tomb!"
7282,THE HARP,"Or teach thou, Spring! the grand recoil"
7283,THE HARP,Of life resurgent from the soil
7284,THE HARP,Wherein was dropped the mortal spoil.

7293,SEASHORE,"Is not my voice thy music, morn and eve?"
7294,SEASHORE,"My breath thy healthful climate in the heats,"

7323,SEASHORE,"This matchless strength. Where shall he find, O waves!"
7324,SEASHORE,A load your Atlas shoulders cannot lift?
7325,SEASHORE,
7326,SEASHORE,I with my hammer pounding evermore
7327,SEASHORE,"The rocky coast, smite Andes into dust,"
7328,SEASHORE,"Strewing my bed, and, in another age,"
7329,SEASHORE,Rebuild a continent of better men.
7330,SEASHORE,Then I unbar the doors: my paths lead out

7334,SEASHORE,I too have arts and sorceries;
7335,SEASHORE,Illusion dwells forever with the wave.

7338,SEASHORE,"For, though he scoop my water in his palm,"
7339,SEASHORE,A few rods off he deems it gems and clouds.
7340,SEASHORE,"Planting strange fruits and sunshine on the shore,"

9016,THE POET,
9017,I,I
9018,I,
9019,I,Right upward on the road of fame
9020,I,With sounding steps the poet came;
9021,I,"Born and nourished in miracles,"
9022,I,"His feet were shod with golden bells,"
9023,I,Or where he stepped the soil did peal
9024,I,As if the dust were glass and steel.
9025,I,The gallant child where'er he came
9026,I,Threw to each fact a tuneful name.
9027,I,The things whereon he cast his eyes
9028,I,"Could not the nations rebaptize,"
9029,I,"Nor Time's snows hide the names he set,"
9030,I,Nor last posterity forget.
9031,I,Yet every scroll whereon he wrote
9032,I,"In latent fire his secret thought,"
9033,I,"Fell unregarded to the ground,"
9034,I,Unseen by such as stood around.
9035,I,"The pious wind took it away,"
9036,I,The reverent darkness hid the lay.
9037,I,Methought like water-haunting birds
9038,I,"Divers or dippers were his words,"
9039,I,And idle clowns beside the mere
9040,I,At the new vision gape and jeer.
9041,I,"But when the noisy scorn was past,"
9042,I,Emerge the wingèd words in haste.
9043,I,"New-bathed, new-trimmed, on healthy wing,"
9044,I,Right to the heaven they steer and sing.
9045,I,
9046,I,"A Brother of the world, his song"
9047,I,Sounded like a tempest strong
9048,I,"Which tore from oaks their branches broad,"
9049,I,And stars from the ecliptic road.
9050,I,"Times wore he as his clothing-weeds,"
9051,I,He sowed the sun and moon for seeds.
9052,I,"As melts the iceberg in the seas,"
9053,I,"As clouds give rain to the eastern breeze,"
9054,I,"As snow-banks thaw in April's beam,"
9055,I,The solid kingdoms like a dream
9056,I,"Resist in vain his motive strain,"
9057,I,They totter now and float amain.
9058,I,For the Muse gave special charge
9059,I,"His learning should be deep and large,"
9060,I,And his training should not scant
9061,I,The deepest lore of wealth or want:
9062,I,"His flesh should feel, his eyes should read"
9063,I,Every maxim of dreadful Need;
9064,I,In its fulness he should taste
9065,I,"Life's honeycomb, but not too fast;"
9066,I,"Full fed, but not intoxicated;"
9067,I,He should be loved; he should be hated;
9068,I,"A blooming child to children dear,"
9069,I,His heart should palpitate with fear.
9070,I,
9071,I,And well he loved to quit his home
9072,I,"And, Calmuck, in his wagon roam"
9073,I,To read new landscapes and old skies;--
9074,I,"But oh, to see his solar eyes"
9075,I,Like meteors which chose their way
9076,I,And rived the dark like a new day!
9077,I,"Not lazy grazing on all they saw,"
9078,I,"Each chimney-pot and cottage door,"
9079,I,"Farm-gear and village picket-fence,"
9080,I,"But, feeding on magnificence,"
9081,I,They bounded to the horizon's edge
9082,I,And searched with the sun's privilege.
9083,I,Landward they reached the mountains old
9084,I,"Where pastoral tribes their flocks infold,"
9085,I,Saw rivers run seaward by cities high
9086,I,And the seas wash the low-hung sky;
9087,I,Saw the endless rack of the firmament
9088,I,"And the sailing moon where the cloud was rent,"
9089,I,And through man and woman and sea and star
9090,I,"Saw the dance of Nature forward and far,"
9091,I,Through worlds and races and terms and times
9092,I,Saw musical order and pairing rhymes.
9093,I,
9094,II,II
9095,II,
9096,II,"The gods talk in the breath of the woods,"
9097,II,"They talk in the shaken pine,"
9098,II,And fill the long reach of the old seashore
9099,II,With dialogue divine;
9100,II,And the poet who overhears
9101,II,Some random word they say
9102,II,Is the fated man of men
9103,II,Whom the ages must obey:
9104,II,One who having nectar drank
9105,II,Into blissful orgies sank;
9106,II,"He takes no mark of night or day,"
9107,II,"He cannot go, he cannot stay,"
9108,II,"He would, yet would not, counsel keep,"
9109,II,"But, like a walker in his sleep"
9110,II,"With staring eye that seeth none,"
9111,II,Ridiculously up and down
9112,II,Seeks how he may fitly tell
9113,II,The heart-o'erlading miracle.
9114,II,
9115,II,"Not yet, not yet,"
9116,II,"Impatient friend,--"
9117,II,A little while attend;
9118,II,"Not yet I sing: but I must wait,"
9119,II,"My hand upon the silent string,"
9120,II,Fully until the end.
9121,II,"I see the coming light,"
9122,II,"I see the scattered gleams,"
9123,II,"Aloft, beneath, on left and right"
9124,II,The stars' own ether beams;
9125,II,"These are but seeds of days,"
9126,II,"Not yet a steadfast morn,"
9127,II,"An intermittent blaze,"
9128,II,An embryo god unborn.
9129,II,
9130,II,"How all things sparkle,"
9131,II,"The dust is alive,"
9132,II,To the birth they arrive:
9133,II,"I snuff the breath of my morning afar,"
9134,II,I see the pale lustres condense to a star:
9135,II,"The fading colors fix,"
9136,II,"The vanishing are seen,"
9137,II,And the world that shall be
9138,II,Twins the world that has been.
9139,II,"I know the appointed hour,"
9140,II,"I greet my office well,"
9141,II,"Never faster, never slower"
9142,II,Revolves the fatal wheel!
9143,II,"The Fairest enchants me,"
9144,II,"The Mighty commands me,"
9145,II,"Saying, 'Stand in thy place;"
9146,II,Up and eastward turn thy face;
9147,II,"As mountains for the morning wait,"
9148,II,"Coming early, coming late,"
9149,II,So thou attend the enriching Fate
9150,II,"Which none can stay, and none accelerate."
9151,II,"I am neither faint nor weary,"
9152,II,"Fill thy will, O faultless heart!"
9153,II,"Here from youth to age I tarry,--"
9154,II,Count it flight of bird or dart.
9155,II,My heart at the heart of things
9156,II,"Heeds no longer lapse of time,"
9157,II,"Rushing ages moult their wings,"
9158,II,Bathing in thy day sublime.
9159,II,
9160,II,"The sun set, but set not his hope:--"
9161,II,"Stars rose, his faith was earlier up:"
9162,II,"Fixed on the enormous galaxy,"
9163,II,"Deeper and older seemed his eye,"
9164,II,And matched his sufferance sublime
9165,II,The taciturnity of Time.
9166,II,
9167,II,"Beside his hut and shading oak,"
9168,II,"Thus to himself the poet spoke,"
9169,II,"'I have supped to-night with gods,"
9170,II,I will not go under a wooden roof:
9171,II,As I walked among the hills
9172,II,"In the love which Nature fills,"
9173,II,"The great stars did not shine aloof,"
9174,II,They hurried down from their deep abodes
9175,II,And hemmed me in their glittering troop.
9176,II,
9177,II,'Divine Inviters! I accept
9178,II,The courtesy ye have shown and kept
9179,II,"From ancient ages for the bard,"
9180,II,To modulate
9181,II,With finer fate
9182,II,A fortune harsh and hard.
9183,II,With aim like yours
9184,II,"I watch your course,"
9185,II,Who never break your lawful dance
9186,II,By error or intemperance.
9187,II,O birds of ether without wings!
9188,II,O heavenly ships without a sail!
9189,II,O fire of fire! O best of things!
9190,II,O mariners who never fail!
9191,II,"Sail swiftly through your amber vault,"
9192,II,"An animated law, a presence to exalt.'"
9193,II,
9194,II,"Ah, happy if a sun or star"
9195,II,"Could chain the wheel of Fortune's car,"
9196,II,"And give to hold an even state,"
9197,II,"Neither dejected nor elate,"
9198,II,That haply man upraised might keep
9199,II,The height of Fancy's far-eyed steep.
9200,II,"In vain: the stars are glowing wheels,"
9201,II,"Giddy with motion Nature reels,"
9202,II,"Sun, moon, man, undulate and stream,"
9203,II,"The mountains flow, the solids seem,"
9204,II,"Change acts, reacts; back, forward hurled,"
9205,II,And pause were palsy to the world.--
9206,II,The morn is come: the starry crowds
9207,II,Are hid behind the thrice-piled clouds;
9208,II,"The new day lowers, and equal odds"
9209,II,Have changed not less the guest of gods;
9210,II,"Discrowned and timid, thoughtless, worn,"
9211,II,The child of genius sits forlorn:
9212,II,"Between two sleeps a short day's stealth,"
9213,II,"'Mid many ails a brittle health,"
9214,II,"A cripple of God, half true, half formed,"
9215,II,"And by great sparks Promethean warmed,"
9216,II,Constrained by impotence to adjourn
9217,II,"To infinite time his eager turn,"
9218,II,His lot of action at the urn.
9219,II,He by false usage pinned about
9220,II,"No breath therein, no passage out,"
9221,II,Cast wishful glances at the stars
9222,II,And wishful saw the Ocean stream:--
9223,II,"'Merge me in the brute universe,"
9224,II,Or lift to a diviner dream!'
9225,II,
9226,II,"Beside him sat enduring love,"
9227,II,"Upon him noble eyes did rest,"
9228,II,"Which, for the Genius that there strove."
9229,II,The follies bore that it invest.
9230,II,"They spoke not, for their earnest sense"
9231,II,Outran the craft of eloquence.
9232,II,
9233,II,"He whom God had thus preferred,--"
9234,II,"To whom sweet angels ministered,"
9235,II,"Saluted him each morn as brother,"
9236,II,"And bragged his virtues to each other,--"
9237,II,"Alas! how were they so beguiled,"
9238,II,"And they so pure? He, foolish child,"
9239,II,"A facile, reckless, wandering will,"
9240,II,"Eager for good, not hating ill,"
9241,II,Thanked Nature for each stroke she dealt;
9242,II,"On his tense chords all strokes were felt,"
9243,II,"The good, the bad with equal zeal,"
9244,II,"He asked, he only asked, to feel."
9245,II,"Timid, self-pleasing, sensitive,"
9246,II,"With Gods, with fools, content to live;"
9247,II,Bended to fops who bent to him;
9248,II,Surface with surfaces did swim.
9249,II,
9250,II,"'Sorrow, sorrow!' the angels cried,"
9251,II,'Is this dear Nature's manly pride?
9252,II,"Call hither thy mortal enemy,"
9253,II,Make him glad thy fall to see!
9254,II,"Yon waterflag, yon sighing osier,"
9255,II,"A drop can shake, a breath can fan;"
9256,II,Maidens laugh and weep; Composure
9257,II,"Is the pudency of man,'"
9258,II,
9259,II,Again by night the poet went
9260,II,From the lighted halls
9261,II,Beneath the darkling firmament
9262,II,"To the seashore, to the old seawalls,"
9263,II,"Out shone a star beneath the cloud,"
9264,II,"The constellation glittered soon,--"
9265,II,You have no lapse; so have ye glowed
9266,II,But once in your dominion.
9267,II,"And yet, dear stars, I know ye shine"
9268,II,Only by needs and loves of mine;
9269,II,"Light-loving, light-asking life in me"
9270,II,Feeds those eternal lamps I see.
9271,II,"And I to whom your light has spoken,"
9272,II,"I, pining to be one of you,"
9273,II,"I fall, my faith is broken,"
9274,II,Ye scorn me from your deeps of blue.
9275,II,"Or if perchance, ye orbs of Fate,"
9276,II,Your ne'er averted glance
9277,II,Beams with a will compassionate
9278,II,"On sons of time and chance,"
9279,II,Then clothe these hands with power
9280,II,"In just proportion,"

9357,I,"There are beggars in Iran and Araby,"
9358,I,SAID was hungrier than all;
9359,I,Hafiz said he was a fly
9360,I,That came to every festival.
9361,I,He came a pilgrim to the Mosque
9362,I,"On trail of camel and caravan,"
9363,I,Knew every temple and kiosk
9364,I,Out from Mecca to Ispahan;
9365,I,"Northward he went to the snowy hills,"
9366,I,At court he sat in the grave Divan.
9367,I,"His music was the south-wind's sigh,"
9368,I,"His lamp, the maiden's downcast eye,"
9369,I,And ever the spell of beauty came
9370,I,And turned the drowsy world to flame.
9371,I,By lake and stream and gleaming hall
9372,I,"And modest copse and the forest tall,"
9373,I,"Where'er he went, the magic guide"
9374,I,Kept its place by the poet's side.
9375,I,"Said melted the days like cups of pearl,"
9376,I,"Served high and low, the lord and the churl,"
9377,I,"Loved harebells nodding on a rock,"
9378,I,"A cabin hung with curling smoke,"
9379,I,Ring of axe or hum of wheel
9380,I,"Or gleam which use can paint on steel,"
9381,I,And huts and tents; nor loved he less
9382,I,"Stately lords in palaces,"
9383,I,"Princely women hard to please,"
9384,I,"Fenced by form and ceremony,"
9385,I,Decked by courtly rites and dress
9386,I,And etiquette of gentilesse.
9387,I,"But when the mate of the snow and wind,"
9388,I,He left each civil scale behind:
9389,I,Him wood-gods fed with honey wild
9390,I,And of his memory beguiled.
9391,I,He loved to watch and wake
9392,I,When the wing of the south-wind whipt the lake
9393,I,And the glassy surface in ripples brake
9394,I,And fled in pretty frowns away
9395,I,"Like the flitting boreal lights,"
9396,I,"Rippling roses in northern nights,"
9397,I,Or like the thrill of Aeolian strings
9398,I,In which the sudden wind-god rings.
9399,I,In caves and hollow trees he crept
9400,I,And near the wolf and panther slept.
9401,I,He came to the green ocean's brim
9402,I,"And saw the wheeling sea-birds skim,"
9403,I,"Summer and winter, o'er the wave,"
9404,I,"Like creatures of a skiey mould,"
9405,I,Impassible to heat or cold.
9406,I,He stood before the tumbling main
9407,I,With joy too tense for sober brain;
9408,I,"He shared the life of the element,"
9409,I,The tie of blood and home was rent:
9410,I,"As if in him the welkin walked,"
9411,I,"The winds took flesh, the mountains talked,"
9412,I,"And he the bard, a crystal soul"
9413,I,Sphered and concentric with the whole.

9434,III,In every glance of Hassan's eye
9435,III,"I read great years of victory,"
9436,III,"And I, who cower mean and small"
9437,III,In the frequent interval
9438,III,"When wisdom not with me resides,"
9439,III,Worship Toil's wisdom that abides.

9445,IV,The civil world will much forgive
9446,IV,"To bards who from its maxims live,"
9447,IV,"But if, grown bold, the poet dare"
9448,IV,Bend his practice to his prayer
9449,IV,And following his mighty heart
9450,IV,"Shame the times and live apart,--"
9451,IV,"_Vae solis!_ I found this,"
9452,IV,That of goods I could not miss
9453,IV,"If I fell within the line,"
9454,IV,"Once a member, all was mine,"
9455,IV,"Houses, banquets, gardens, fountains,"
9456,IV,Fortune's delectable mountains;
9457,IV,"But if I would walk alone,"
9458,IV,Was neither cloak nor crumb my own.
9459,IV,"And thus the high Muse treated me,"
9460,IV,"Directly never greeted me,"
9461,IV,"But when she spread her dearest spells,"
9462,IV,Feigned to speak to some one else.
9463,IV,"I was free to overhear,"
9464,IV,Or I might at will forbear;
9465,IV,"Yet mark me well, that idle word"
9466,IV,Thus at random overheard
9467,IV,"Was the symphony of spheres,"
9468,IV,"And proverb of a thousand years,"
9469,IV,"The light wherewith all planets shone,"
9470,IV,"The livery all events put on,"
9471,IV,"It fell in rain, it grew in grain,"
9472,IV,"It put on flesh in friendly form,"
9473,IV,"Frowned in my foe and growled in storm,"
9474,IV,"It spoke in Tullius Cicero,"
9475,IV,In Milton and in Angelo:
9476,IV,I travelled and found it at Rome;
9477,IV,Eastward it filled all Heathendom
9478,IV,And it lay on my hearth when I came home.

9481,V,
9482,V,"Mask thy wisdom with delight,"
9483,V,"Toy with the bow, yet hit the white,"
9484,V,As Jelaleddin old and gray;
9485,V,"He seemed to bask, to dream and play"
9486,V,Without remoter hope or fear
9487,V,Than still to entertain his ear
9488,V,And pass the burning summer-time
9489,V,In the palm-grove with a rhyme;
9490,V,Heedless that each cunning word
9491,V,Tribes and ages overheard:
9492,V,Those idle catches told the laws
9493,V,Holding Nature to her cause.
9494,V,
9495,V,God only knew how Saadi dined;
9496,V,"Roses he ate, and drank the wind;"
9497,V,"He freelier breathed beside the pine,"
9498,V,In cities he was low and mean;
9499,V,The mountain waters washed him clean
9500,V,And by the sea-waves he was strong;
9501,V,"He heard their medicinal song,"
9502,V,"Asked no physician but the wave,"
9503,V,No palace but his sea-beat cave.
9504,V,
9505,V,"Saadi held the Muse in awe,"
9506,V,She was his mistress and his law;
9507,V,"A twelvemonth he could silence hold,"
9508,V,Nor ran to speak till she him told;
9509,V,"He felt the flame, the fanning wings,"
9510,V,"Nor offered words till they were things,"
9511,V,Glad when the solid mountain swims
9512,V,In music and uplifting hymns.
9513,V,
9514,V,"Charmed from fagot and from steel,"
9515,V,"Harvests grew upon his tongue,"
9516,V,Past and future must reveal
9517,V,All their heart when Saadi sung;
9518,V,Sun and moon must fall amain
9519,V,"Like sower's seeds into his brain,"
9520,V,There quickened to be born again.
9521,V,
9522,V,"The free winds told him what they knew,"
9523,V,Discoursed of fortune as they blew;
9524,V,Omens and signs that filled the air
9525,V,To him authentic witness bare;
9526,V,"The birds brought auguries on their wings,"
9527,V,And carolled undeceiving things
9528,V,"Him to beckon, him to warn;"
9529,V,Well might then the poet scorn
9530,V,To learn of scribe or courier
9531,V,Things writ in vaster character;
9532,V,And on his mind at dawn of day
9533,V,Soft shadows of the evening lay.

9542,V,"Not his the feaster's wine,"

9550,V,The wheat thou strew'st be souls.
9551,V,
9552,V,
9553,V,
9554,V,I grieve that better souls than mine
9555,V,Docile read my measured line:
9556,V,High destined youths and holy maids
9557,V,Hallow these my orchard shades;
9558,V,Environ me and me baptize
9559,V,With light that streams from gracious eyes.
9560,V,"I dare not be beloved and known,"
9561,V,"I ungrateful, I alone."
9562,V,
9563,V,"Ever find me dim regards,"
9564,V,"Love of ladies, love of bards,"
9565,V,"Marked forbearance, compliments,"
9566,V,Tokens of benevolence.
9567,V,"What then, can I love myself?"
9568,V,"Fame is profitless as pelf,"
9569,V,A good in Nature not allowed
9570,V,"They love me, as I love a cloud"
9571,V,"Sailing falsely in the sphere,"
9572,V,Hated mist if it come near.
9573,V,
9574,V,
9575,V,
9576,V,"For thought, and not praise;"
9577,V,Thought is the wages
9578,V,"For which I sell days,"
9579,V,Will gladly sell ages
9580,V,And willing grow old
9581,V,"Deaf, and dumb, and blind, and cold,"
9582,V,"Melting matter into dreams,"
9583,V,Panoramas which I saw
9584,V,And whatever glows or seems

9586,V,
9587,V,
9588,V,
9589,V,For Fancy's gift
9590,V,Can mountains lift;
9591,V,The Muse can knit
9592,V,"What is past, what is done,"
9593,V,With the web that's just begun;
9594,V,"Making free with time and size,"
9595,V,"Dwindles here, there magnifies,"
9596,V,Swells a rain-drop to a tun;
9597,V,So to repeat
9598,V,No word or feat
9599,V,"Crowds in a day the sum of ages,"
9600,V,And blushing Love outwits the sages.
9601,V,
9602,V,
9603,V,
9604,V,Try the might the Muse affords
9605,V,And the balm of thoughtful words;
9606,V,Bring music to the desolate;
9607,V,Hang roses on the stony fate.
9608,V,
9609,V,
9610,V,
9611,V,"But over all his crowning grace,"
9612,V,"Wherefor thanks God his daily praise,"
9613,V,Is the purging of his eye
9614,V,To see the people of the sky:
9615,V,From blue mount and headland dim
9616,V,"Friendly hands stretch forth to him,"
9617,V,"Him they beckon, him advise"
9618,V,Of heavenlier prosperities
9619,V,And a more excelling grace
9620,V,And a truer bosom-glow
9621,V,Than the wine-fed feasters know.
9622,V,"They turn his heart from lovely maids,"
9623,V,And make the darlings of the earth
9624,V,"Swainish, coarse and nothing worth:"
9625,V,Teach him gladly to postpone
9626,V,Pleasures to another stage
9627,V,"Beyond the scope of human age,"

9636,V,Framed afar as Fates and Loves.
9637,V,
9638,V,
9639,V,
9640,V,And as the light divides the dark
9641,V,"Through with living swords,"

9675,V,

9730,V,I count as many as there are
9731,V,"Cinquefoils or violets in the grass,"
9732,V,"So many saints and saviors,"
9733,V,So many high behaviors
9734,V,Salute the bard who is alive
9735,V,And only sees what he doth give.
9736,V,
9737,V,
9738,V,
9739,V,Coin the day-dawn into lines
9740,V,In which its proper splendor shines;
9741,V,Coin the moonlight into verse
9742,V,"Which all its marvel shall rehearse,"
9743,V,Chasing with words fast-flowing things; nor try
9744,V,To plant thy shrivelled pedantry
9745,V,On the shoulders of the sky.
9746,V,
9747,V,
9748,V,
9749,V,"Ah, not to me those dreams belong!"
9750,V,A better voice peals through my song.

9763,V,
9764,V,
9765,V,
9766,V,"If bright the sun, he tarries,"

9769,V,No more baggage than a bird.

11235,THE RIVER,Whence brought his sunny bubbles ere he washed
11236,THE RIVER,"The fragrant flag-roots in my father's fields,"
11237,THE RIVER,And where thereafter in the world he went.
11238,THE RIVER,"Look, here he is, unaltered, save that now"
11239,THE RIVER,He hath broke his banks and flooded all the vales
11240,THE RIVER,With his redundant waves.

11245,THE RIVER,A blooming hunter of a fairy fine.
11246,THE RIVER,And hark! where overhead the ancient crows
11247,THE RIVER,Hold their sour conversation in the sky:--
11248,THE RIVER,"These are the same, but I am not the same,"
11249,THE RIVER,"But wiser than I was, and wise enough"
11250,THE RIVER,"Not to regret the changes, tho' they cost"

11253,THE RIVER,"These idle flowers, that tremble in the wind,"

11256,THE RIVER,That rustles down the well-known forest road--
11257,THE RIVER,It hath a sound more eloquent than speech.
11258,THE RIVER,"The stream, the trees, the grass, the sighing wind,"
11259,THE RIVER,All of them utter sounds of 'monishment
11260,THE RIVER,And grave parental love.
11261,THE RIVER,"They are not of our race, they seem to say,"
11262,THE RIVER,"And yet have knowledge of our moral race,"
11263,THE RIVER,"And somewhat of majestic sympathy,"
11264,THE RIVER,"Something of pity for the puny clay,"
11265,THE RIVER,That holds and boasts the immeasurable mind.
11266,THE RIVER,I feel as I were welcome to these trees
11267,THE RIVER,"After long months of weary wandering,"
11268,THE RIVER,Acknowledged by their hospitable boughs;
11269,THE RIVER,"They know me as their son, for side by side,"
11270,THE RIVER,"They were coeval with my ancestors,"
11271,THE RIVER,"Adorned with them my country's primitive times,"
