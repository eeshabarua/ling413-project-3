71,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,
72,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"""Violets! Violets! Violets!"""
73,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,This was the cry I heard
74,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,As I passed through the street of a city;
75,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,And quickly my heart was stirred
76,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"To an incomprehensible pity,"
77,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,At the undertone of the cry;
78,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,For it seemed like the voice of one
79,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"Who was stricken, and all undone,"
80,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,Who was only longing to die.
81,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,
82,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"""Violets! Violets! Violets!"""
83,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,The voice came nearer still.
84,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"""Surely,"" I said, ""it is May,"
85,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"And out on valley and hill,"
86,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"The violets blooming to-day,"
87,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,Send this invitation to me
88,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,To come and be with them once more;
89,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"I know they are dear as can be,"
90,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"And I hate the town with its roar."""
91,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,
92,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"""Violets! Violets! Violets!"""
93,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"Children of sun and of dew,"
94,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"Flakes of the blue of the sky,"
95,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,There is somebody calling to you
96,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,Who seems to be longing to die;
97,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,Yet violets are so sweet
98,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,They can scarcely have dealings with death.
99,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"Can it be, that the dying breath,"
100,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,That comes from the one last beat
101,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"Of a true heart, turns to the flowers?"
102,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,
103,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"""Violets! Violets! Violets!"""
104,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,The crier is near me at last.
105,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,With my eyes I am holding her fast.
106,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,She is a lovely seller of flowers.
107,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,She is one whom the town devours
108,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,In its jaws of bustle and strife.
109,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,How poverty grinds down a life;
110,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"For, lost in the slime of a city,"
111,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,What is a beautiful face?
112,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,Few are they who have pity
113,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,For loveliness in disgrace.
114,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"Yet she that I hold with my eyes,"
115,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"Who seems so modest and wise,"
116,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"Has not yet fallen, I am sure."
117,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,She has nobly learned to endure.
118,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"Large, and mournful, and meek,"
119,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,Her eyes seem to drink from my own.
120,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,Her curls are carelessly thrown
121,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,Back from white shoulder and cheek;
122,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"And her lips seem strawberries, lost"
123,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,In some Arctic country of frost.
124,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"The slightest curve on a face,"
125,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,May give an expression unmeet;
126,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"Yet hers is so perfect and sweet,"
127,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"And shaped with such delicate grace,"
128,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,Its loveliness is complete.
129,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,
130,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"""Violets! Violets! Violets!"""
131,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,I hear the cry once more;
132,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,But not as I heard it before.
133,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,It whispers no more of death;
134,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"But only of odorous breath,"
135,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"And modest flowers, and life."
136,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"I purchased a cluster, so rife"
137,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"With the touch of her tapering hand,"
138,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,I seem to hold it in mine.
139,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,"I would I could understand,"
140,THE VENDER OF VIOLETS.,Why a touch seems so divine.

858,PART FIRST.,
859,PART FIRST.,This is his story as I gathered it;
860,PART FIRST.,"The simple story of a plain, true man."
861,PART FIRST.,"I cling with Abraham Lincoln to the fact,"
862,PART FIRST.,That they who make a nation truly great
863,PART FIRST.,"Are plain men, scattered in each walk of life."

870,I.,I.
871,I.,
872,I.,"An African, thick lipped, and heavy heeled,"
873,I.,"With woolly hair, large eyes, and even teeth,"
874,I.,"A forehead high, and beetling at the brows"
875,I.,Enough to show a strong perceptive thought
876,I.,Ran out beyond the eyesight in all things--
877,I.,"A negro with no claim to any right,"
878,I.,A savage with no knowledge we possess
879,I.,"Of science, art, or books, or government--"
880,I.,"Slave from a slaver to the Georgia coast,"
881,I.,His life disposed of at the market rate;
882,I.,"Yet in the face of all, a plain, true man--"
883,I.,"Lowly and ignorant, yet brave and good,"
884,I.,"Karagwe, named for his native tribe."
885,I.,
886,I.,"His buyer was the planter, Dalton Earl,"
887,I.,"Of Valley Earl, an owner of broad lands,"
888,I.,"Whose wife, in some gray daybreak of the past,"
889,I.,"Had tarried with the night, and passed away;"
890,I.,"But left him, as the marriage ring of death"
891,I.,"Was slipped upon her finger, a fair child."
892,I.,He called this daughter Coralline. To him
893,I.,"She was a spray of whitest coral, found"
894,I.,Upon the coast where death's impatient sea
895,I.,Hems in the narrow continent of life.
896,I.,
897,II.,II.
898,II.,
899,II.,Each day brought health and strength to Karagwe.
900,II.,"Each day he worked upon the cotton-field,"
901,II.,And every boll he picked had thought in it.
902,II.,"He labored, but his mind was otherwhere;"
903,II.,"Strange fancies, faced with ignorance and doubt,"
904,II.,"Came peering in, each jostling each aside,"
905,II.,"Like men, who in a crowded market-place,"
906,II.,"Push 'gainst the mob, to see some pageant pass."
907,II.,
908,II.,All things were new and wonderful to him.
909,II.,What were the papers that his owner read?
910,II.,"The marks and characters, what could they mean?"
911,II.,"If speech, what then the use of oral speech?"
912,II.,At last by digging round the spreading roots
913,II.,"Of this one thought, he found the treasure out--"
914,II.,Knowledge: this was the burden which was borne
915,II.,"By these black, busy, ant-like characters."
916,II.,
917,II.,But how acquire the meaning of the signs?
918,II.,"He found a scrap of paper in the lane,"
919,II.,"And put it by, and saved it carefully,"
920,II.,"Till once, when all alone, he drew it forth,"
921,II.,"And gazed at it, and strove to learn its sense."
922,II.,"But while he studied, Dalton Earl rode by,"
923,II.,"And angered at the indication shown,"
924,II.,"Snatched rudely at the paper in his hand,"
925,II.,"And tore it up, commanding that the slave"
926,II.,Have fifty lashes for this breach of law.
927,II.,
928,II.,Long on his sentence pondered Karagwe.
929,II.,Against the law? Who then could make a law
930,II.,"Decreeing knowledge to a certain few,"
931,II.,To others ignorance? Surely not God;
932,II.,"For God, the white-haired negro with a text"
933,II.,"Had said loved justice, and was friend to all."
934,II.,"If man, then the authority was null."
935,II.,
936,II.,"The fifty lashes scourged the slave's bare back,"
937,II.,"The red blood running down at every stroke,"
938,II.,The dark skin clinging ghastly to the lash.
939,II.,No moan escaped him at the stinging pain.
940,II.,"Tremblingly he stood, and patiently bore all;"
941,II.,"His heart indignant, shaking his broad breast,"
942,II.,"Strong as the heart that Hippodamia wept,"
943,II.,"Which with the cold, intrusive brass thrust through,"
944,II.,Shook even the Greek spear's extremity.
945,II.,
946,III.,III.
947,III.,
948,III.,"And so the negro's energy, made strong"
949,III.,"By the one vile argument of the lash,"
950,III.,Was given to learn the secret of the books.
951,III.,"He studied in the woods, and by the fall"
952,III.,"Which shoots down like an arrow from the cliff,"
953,III.,Feathered with spray and barbed with hues of flint.
954,III.,"His books were bits of paper printed on,"
955,III.,"Found here and there, brought thither by the wind."
956,III.,Once standing near the bottom of the fall
957,III.,"And gazing up, he saw upon the verge"
958,III.,"Of the dark cliff above him, gathering flowers,"
959,III.,"His master's child, sweet Coralline; she leaned"
960,III.,"Out over the blank abyss, and smiled."
961,III.,"He climbed the bank, but ere he reached the height,"
962,III.,A shriek rang out above the water's roar;
963,III.,"The babe had fallen, and a quadroon girl"
964,III.,"Lay fainting near, upon the treacherous sward."
965,III.,"The babe had fallen, but with no injury yet."
966,III.,"Karagwe slipped down upon a narrow ledge,"
967,III.,"And reaching out, caught hold the little frock,"
968,III.,"Whose folds were tangled in a bending shrub,"
969,III.,And safely drew the child back to the cliff.
970,III.,"The slave had favors shown him after this,"
971,III.,"Although he spoke not of the perilous deed,"
972,III.,Nor spoke of any merit he had done.
973,III.,
974,IV.,IV.
975,IV.,
976,IV.,"By being always when he could alone,"
977,IV.,"By wandering often in the woods and fields,"
978,IV.,He came at last to live in revery.
979,IV.,"But little thought is there in revery,"
980,IV.,"But little thought, for most is useless dream;"
981,IV.,And whoso dreams may never learn to act.
982,IV.,The dreamer and the thinker are not kin.
983,IV.,Sweet revery is like a little boat
984,IV.,That idly drifts along a listless stream--
985,IV.,"A painted boat, afloat without an oar."
986,IV.,
987,IV.,And nature brought strange meanings to the slave;
988,IV.,"He loved the breeze, and when he heard it pass"
989,IV.,"The agitated pines, he fancied it"
990,IV.,"The silken court-dress of the lady Wind,"
991,IV.,"Bustling among the foliage, as she went"
992,IV.,To waltz the whirlwind on the distant sea.
993,IV.,
994,IV.,The negro preacher with the text had said
995,IV.,"That when men died, the soul lived on and on;"
996,IV.,"If so, of what material was the soul?"
997,IV.,The eye could not behold it; why not then
998,IV.,The viewless air be filled with living souls?
999,IV.,"Not only these, but other shapes and forms"
1000,IV.,Might dwell unseen about us at all times.
1001,IV.,"If air was only matter rarefied,"
1002,IV.,Why could not things still more impalpable
1003,IV.,Have real existence? Whence came our thoughts?
1004,IV.,As angels came to shepherds in Chaldee;
1005,IV.,They were not ours. He fancied that most thoughts
1006,IV.,"Were whispered to the soul, or good, or bad."
1007,IV.,"The bad were like a demon, a vast shape"
1008,IV.,"With measureless black wings, that when it dared,"
1009,IV.,"Placed its clawed foot upon the necks of men,"
1010,IV.,"And with the very shadow of itself,"
1011,IV.,Made their lives darker than a starless night.
1012,IV.,"He did not strive to picture out the good,"
1013,IV.,Or give to them a figure; but he knew
1014,IV.,No glory of the sunset could compare
1015,IV.,With the clear splendor of one noble deed.
1016,IV.,
1017,IV.,He proudly dreamed that to no other mind
1018,IV.,Had these imaginings been uttered.
1019,IV.,"Alas! poor heart, how many have awoke,"
1020,IV.,And found their newest thoughts as old as time--
1021,IV.,Their brightest fancies woven in the threads
1022,IV.,"Of ancient poems, history or romance,"
1023,IV.,And knowledge still elusive and far off.
1024,IV.,
1025,V.,V.
1026,V.,
1027,V.,The days that lengthen into years went on.
1028,V.,The quadroon girl who fainted on the cliff
1029,V.,"Was Ruth; now, blooming into womanhood,"
1030,V.,"She looked on Karagwe, and seeing there"
1031,V.,"Something above the level of the slave,"
1032,V.,Watched him with interest in all his ways.
1033,V.,
1034,V.,At first through pity was she drawn to him.
1035,V.,"While both were sitting on a rustic seat,"
1036,V.,"Near the tall mansion where the planter dwelt,"
1037,V.,"A drunken overseer came straggling past,"
1038,V.,"And seeing in the dusk a female form,"
1039,V.,"Swayed up to her, and caught her by the arm,"
1040,V.,"And with an insult, strove to drag her on."
1041,V.,"Ruth spoke not; but the negro, with one grasp"
1042,V.,"Upon the white man, caused her quick release."
1043,V.,"He turned, and in the face struck Karagwe."
1044,V.,"The patient slave did not return the blow,"
1045,V.,"But the next day they tied him to a post,"
1046,V.,And fifty stripes his naked shoulders flayed.
1047,V.,"Stricken in mind at being deeply wronged,"
1048,V.,"Filled with a noble scorn, that men most learned"
1049,V.,"Would so degrade a brother race of men,"
1050,V.,He wept at heart; no groan fled through his lips.
1051,V.,
1052,V.,Yet in a few days he was forced to go
1053,V.,"And work beneath the intolerable sun,"
1054,V.,"Picking the cotton-boll, and bearing it"
1055,V.,"In a rude basket, on his wounded back,"
1056,V.,Up a steep hill-side to the cotton gin.
1057,V.,
1058,VI.,VI.
1059,VI.,
1060,VI.,"Ruth, as she walked the pebbled garden lanes,"
1061,VI.,"Or daily in her hundred household cares,"
1062,VI.,Thought of the dark face and noble heart
1063,VI.,"Of Karagwe, and truly pitied him."
1064,VI.,
1065,VI.,"He, when the labor of the day was done,"
1066,VI.,"Moved through the dusk, among the dewy leaves,"
1067,VI.,"And, darker than the shadows, scaled the wall,"
1068,VI.,"And waited in the garden, crouching down"
1069,VI.,"Among the foliage of the fragrant trees,"
1070,VI.,Hoping that she again might come that way.
1071,VI.,"He saw her through the window of the house,"
1072,VI.,"Pass and repass, and heard her sweetly sing"
1073,VI.,A tender song of love and pity blent;
1074,VI.,"But would not call to her, nor give a sign"
1075,VI.,That he was there; to see her was enough.
1076,VI.,"Perhaps, if those about her knew he came"
1077,VI.,"To meet her in the garden, they would place"
1078,VI.,"Some punishment upon her, some restraint,"
1079,VI.,"That she, though innocent, might have to bear."
1080,VI.,"So he passed back again to his low cot,"
1081,VI.,"And on his poor straw pallet, dreamed of her,"
1082,VI.,"As loyally perhaps as Chastelard,"
1083,VI.,"Lying asleep upon his palace couch,"
1084,VI.,"Dreamed of Queen Mary, and the love he gave."
1085,VI.,
1086,VII.,VII.
1087,VII.,
1088,VII.,"Ruth was but tinged with shade, and always seemed"
1089,VII.,"Some luscious fruit, with but the slightest hint"
1090,VII.,Of something foreign to the grafted bough
1091,VII.,"Whereon it grew. Her eyes were black, and large,"
1092,VII.,"And passionate, and proved the deathless soul,"
1093,VII.,"That through their portals looked upon the world,"
1094,VII.,Was capable of hatred and revenge.
1095,VII.,"Her long black lashes hung above their depths,"
1096,VII.,Like lotus leaves o'er some Egyptian spring.
1097,VII.,"And they were dreamy, too, at intervals,"
1098,VII.,And glowed with tender beauty when she loved.
1099,VII.,"Her grace made for her such appropriate wear,"
1100,VII.,"That, though her gown was of the coarsest cloth,"
1101,VII.,"And though her duty was the lowest kind,"
1102,VII.,It seemed apparel more desirable
1103,VII.,Than trailing robes of velvet or of silk.
1104,VII.,"Her voice was full, and sweet, and musical,"
1105,VII.,Soft as the low breathings of an instrument
1106,VII.,Touched by the unseen fingers of the breeze.
1107,VII.,
1108,VIII.,VIII.
1109,VIII.,
1110,VIII.,"The large plantation, next to Dalton Earl's,"
1111,VIII.,"Was owned by Richard Wain, a hated man--"
1112,VIII.,Hated among his slaves and in the town.
1113,VIII.,"Uncouth, revengeful, and a drunkard he."
1114,VIII.,Two miles up by the river ran his lands;
1115,VIII.,"And here, within a green-roofed kirk of woods,"
1116,VIII.,The slave found that seclusion he desired.
1117,VIII.,His only treasure was a Testament
1118,VIII.,Hid in the friendly opening of a tree.
1119,VIII.,"Often the book was kept within his cot,"
1120,VIII.,"At times lay next his heart, nor did its beat"
1121,VIII.,Defile the fruity knowledge on the leaves.
1122,VIII.,The words were sweet as wine of Eshcol grapes
1123,VIII.,To his parched lips. He saw the past arise.
1124,VIII.,"Vague were the people, and the pageant moved,"
1125,VIII.,Uncertain as the figures in the dusk;
1126,VIII.,"Yet One there was, who stood in bold relief;"
1127,VIII.,"A lovely, noble face with sweeping beard,"
1128,VIII.,And hair that trailed in beauty round his neck;
1129,VIII.,"A patient man, whose deeds were always good."
1130,VIII.,Whose words were brave for freedom and mankind.
1131,VIII.,
1132,IX.,IX.
1133,IX.,
1134,IX.,"In passing through the grounds of Richard Wain,"
1135,IX.,"Karagwe found, upon a plat of grass,"
1136,IX.,"Some sheets of paper fastened at the ends,"
1137,IX.,"Blown from the house, he thought, or thrown away."
1138,IX.,The sheets were closely written on and sealed.
1139,IX.,Here was a long-sought opportunity
1140,IX.,To learn the older letters of the pen.
1141,IX.,"That night the writings, wrapped about the Book,"
1142,IX.,Were safe within the hollow of the tree.
1143,IX.,
1144,X.,X.
1145,X.,
1146,X.,"All day he dreamed, ""What token shall I give."
1147,X.,"That she will know my thought and understand."""
1148,X.,"He caught at last a velvet honey-bee,"
1149,X.,"Weighed down with its gold treasure in its belt,"
1150,X.,"And killed it; then, when morning came again,"
1151,X.,Bore it to Ruth beneath the fragrant trees.
1152,X.,"""I bring you, Ruth, a dead bee for a sign."
1153,X.,"For if to-day you wear it in your hair,"
1154,X.,"When once again you come to walk the lane,"
1155,X.,"I then shall know that you are truly mine,"
1156,X.,"Willing to be my wife, and share my lot,"
1157,X.,And let me toil with you like any bee;
1158,X.,"But if you do not wear it, then I shall care"
1159,X.,"No more for anything; but waste my life,"
1160,X.,"A bee without a queen."" Then not one word"
1161,X.,"Spoke Ruth; but when the sunset came, and she"
1162,X.,"Went from the house again to walk alone,"
1163,X.,The dead bee glittered gem-like in her hair.
1164,X.,"And him she met for whom the sign was meant,"
1165,X.,"And in his hand she laid her own, and smiled."
1166,X.,
1167,XI.,XI.
1168,XI.,
1169,XI.,"The next day, Richard Wain, when riding past,"
1170,XI.,"Heard Ruth's bird-voice trilling in the lane,"
1171,XI.,"And caught a glimpse of her between the trees,"
1172,XI.,"A picture, for an instant, in a frame."
1173,XI.,"He thought, ""The prize I coveted is near;"
1174,XI.,"She will be mine before the set of sun."""
1175,XI.,"Returning soon, toward the house he went,"
1176,XI.,"Strode to the door, calling for Dalton Earl,"
1177,XI.,And told him for what merchandise he came.
1178,XI.,"The girl was not for sale, the other said."
1179,XI.,"""You talk at random now,"" said Richard Wain,"
1180,XI.,"""You know I hold the deed of all your lands,"
1181,XI.,"And so, unless you let the woman go,"
1182,XI.,"Your whole estate shall have a sheriff's sale."""
1183,XI.,"The planter turned a coward at the threat,"
1184,XI.,And knowing well what blood ran in the veins
1185,XI.,"Of her he sold, reluctant gave consent."
1186,XI.,
1187,XI.,"Above his wine he told Ruth of her fate,"
1188,XI.,"And to the floor she fell, and swooned away."
1189,XI.,"Recovering, she rose upon her knees,"
1190,XI.,"And begged, and prayed, that she might still remain."
1191,XI.,"At this he told her how the lands were held,"
1192,XI.,And if she went not he must starve or beg.
1193,XI.,"""Then let the lands be sold, and sold again;"
1194,XI.,"If his, they are not yours. What good will come"
1195,XI.,If I do go to him? then all is his.
1196,XI.,Last night I gave my hand to Karagwe.
1197,XI.,"O, it will break my heart to go away."""
1198,XI.,Lightly his mustache twirled Dalton Earl.
1199,XI.,
1200,XI.,"At dusk, in tears to Karagwe's low roof,"
1201,XI.,"Ruth passed, and uttered, with wild, angry words,"
1202,XI.,The hard conditions that had been imposed.
1203,XI.,"She wept; he comforted: ""There yet was hope:"
1204,XI.,"There was a Hero, in a Book he read,"
1205,XI.,"Who said that those who suffered would be blessed."""
1206,XI.,"Then for the last, toward the planter's house"
1207,XI.,"They walked, and o'er them saw the spider moon"
1208,XI.,Weaving the storm upon its web of cloud.
1209,XI.,
1210,XII.,XII.
1211,XII.,
1212,XII.,"But Karagwe, when once he turned again,"
1213,XII.,Smote wildly his infuriated breast.
1214,XII.,His fierce eyes flashed; he thirsted for revenge.
1215,XII.,"Then came a calmer mood, and far away"
1216,XII.,Sped the expelled thoughts like shuddering gusts of wind.
1217,XII.,He wept that this injustice should be done;
1218,XII.,"Yet knew that in God's hand the scale was set,"
1219,XII.,"And though His poor, down-trodden, waited long,"
1220,XII.,"They waited surely, for His hour would come."
1221,XII.,
1222,XIII.,XIII.
1223,XIII.,
1224,XIII.,"The night passed, and the troublous morning broke,"
1225,XIII.,And Ruth was sold away from him she loved.
1226,XIII.,
1227,XIII.,"The dark day died, and when the moon arose,"
1228,XIII.,"The foremost torch in day's long funeral train,"
1229,XIII.,"Karagwe went down toward the river's brink,"
1230,XIII.,Thinking of what had been. He turned and saw
1231,XIII.,His enemy walk calmly up the road.
1232,XIII.,Quickly behind him came another form;
1233,XIII.,"And in a jeweled hand, half raised to strike,"
1234,XIII.,"A poniard glistened. Then the negro rose,"
1235,XIII.,"And caught the weapon from the assassin's grasp,"
1236,XIII.,"And stood before the planter, Dalton Earl!"
1237,XIII.,"""Forgive,"" he said, ""Forgiveness is a slave;"
1238,XIII.,"She has no pride, she never does an ill;"
1239,XIII.,"For she is meekly great, and nobly good,"
1240,XIII.,"And patient, though the lash of anger smites."""
1241,XIII.,
1242,XIII.,"Rebuked, the master stood before the slave,"
1243,XIII.,"And Richard Wain passed on, nor knew his life"
1244,XIII.,Was saved by one that he had that day wronged.
1245,XIII.,"Thus Dalton Earl: ""I thank you for this act,"
1246,XIII.,Thwarting a bad intent. Yet I had cause
1247,XIII.,To take the sullied life of Richard Wain.
1248,XIII.,"He drugged the wine he gave me at his house,"
1249,XIII.,And knowing that I had with me the deed
1250,XIII.,"And title of my lands, begged me to play,"
1251,XIII.,"And while I played, stake all upon a card."
1252,XIII.,"He won, and I have hated from that hour."""
1253,XIII.,
1254,XIV.,XIV.
1255,XIV.,
1256,XIV.,"Like some great thought that finds release at last,"
1257,XIV.,The happy Spring in buds expression found.
1258,XIV.,
1259,XIV.,Coralline Earl grew rich in every grace.
1260,XIV.,"Her eyes' blue heavens were serene with soul,"
1261,XIV.,And goodness sunned her face from light within.
1262,XIV.,Her hands were soft with kindness. On her brow
1263,XIV.,"Shone hope, more lovely than a ruby star."
1264,XIV.,
1265,XIV.,As in the ancient days sat Mordecai
1266,XIV.,"At the king's gate, and waited for the hour,"
1267,XIV.,"When, clothed with pomp, he too should take his seat"
1268,XIV.,"Among the mighty nobles of the land,"
1269,XIV.,"So at the gateway of her palace heart,"
1270,XIV.,"Love tarried, that he too might enter in,"
1271,XIV.,And rule the kingdom of another life.
1272,XIV.,
1273,XIV.,Not long the waiting; for when Stanley Thane
1274,XIV.,"Came from his northern home with Dalton Earl,"
1275,XIV.,"And on the terrace steps met Coralline,"
1276,XIV.,Love took the sceptre that his waiting won.
1277,XIV.,
1278,XIV.,Well worthy to be loved was Stanley Thane.
1279,XIV.,"He could not claim a titled ancestor,"
1280,XIV.,Nor boast of any blood but Puritan.
1281,XIV.,"His father was successful on exchange,"
1282,XIV.,"Reaped fortune by a rise in merchandise,"
1283,XIV.,Now sent his partner son with Dalton Earl
1284,XIV.,Toward the claspless girdle of the South.
1285,XIV.,And Stanley Thane was all that makes true men;
1286,XIV.,"High thought, high purpose, loving right the best,"
1287,XIV.,His mind was clear and fresh as air at morn.
1288,XIV.,
1289,XIV.,"He kissed the rosy tips of Coralline's hand,"
1290,XIV.,"And that day galloped with her through the town,"
1291,XIV.,"And wandered with her down magnolia lanes,"
1292,XIV.,"And watched, below the spray-woofed fall, the brook,"
1293,XIV.,"That seemed a maid, who, sitting at a loom,"
1294,XIV.,Wove misty lace to decorate the rocks.
1295,XIV.,
1296,XV.,XV.
1297,XV.,
1298,XV.,Long o'er his writings hidden in the tree
1299,XV.,"Pondered the slave, and found at last their worth."
1300,XV.,Must he return them? To whom did they belong?
1301,XV.,If he should give them back to Dalton Earl
1302,XV.,"Unjustly, Richard Wain might claim them still."
1303,XV.,"He chose to keep there folded round the Book,"
1304,XV.,Hid in the secret hollow of the tree.
1305,XV.,
1306,XV.,"He thought of Ruth as one who was at rest,"
1307,XV.,"And wept for her as though she was no more,"
1308,XV.,"And sometimes gathered flowers, and placed them where"
1309,XV.,"He knew she soon would pass, as tenderly"
1310,XV.,As though he laid them down upon her grave.
1311,XV.,
1312,XVI.,XVI.
1313,XVI.,
1314,XVI.,"Once in the twilight, as the shadows fell,"
1315,XVI.,"A skiff shot from the under-reaching shore,"
1316,XVI.,And Stanley Thane and Coralline sailed down
1317,XVI.,"The languid waters, 'neath the dappled moon."
1318,XVI.,They spoke of giant wars that yet might be
1319,XVI.,To drive the dragon Slavery from the land.
1320,XVI.,Coralline smoothed the evils it had wrought.
1321,XVI.,"Stanley, who could not see a wrong excused,"
1322,XVI.,"Said, ""God is just; he knows nor white nor black."
1323,XVI.,"If war must come, each shackle will be forced,"
1324,XVI.,"To make, at last, the nation wholly free."""
1325,XVI.,
1326,XVI.,"And Karagwe, who pulled a silent oar,"
1327,XVI.,Shut the winged words in cages of his heart;
1328,XVI.,"But Coralline was angry at the speech,"
1329,XVI.,"And rained disdain on noble Stanley's head,"
1330,XVI.,"Scorning his Northern thought and Northern blood,"
1331,XVI.,And sighed that it had been their lot to meet.
1332,XVI.,"""If that is true,"" he said, ""then let us part,"
1333,XVI.,And let us hope we shall not meet again.
1334,XVI.,"Adieu! for I shall see you never more."""
1335,XVI.,
1336,XVI.,"The boat was near the bank; he sprang to it,"
1337,XVI.,And left her sitting in the gilded prow--
1338,XVI.,"Her pride, a raging Hector of the hour,"
1339,XVI.,"Fighting a thousand tears, whose war-cry rose:"
1340,XVI.,Thin patience brings thick damage in the end.
1341,XVI.,
1342,XVII.,XVII.
1343,XVII.,
1344,XVII.,"When Richard Wain found that the deed was lost,"
1345,XVII.,"Which he had won at play with Dalton Earl,"
1346,XVII.,"Chagrin and rage were ready at a beck,"
1347,XVII.,"Like waters in a dam, to pass the race,"
1348,XVII.,And turn the voluble mill-wheel of his tongue.
1349,XVII.,"He half suspected Dalton Earl the thief,"
1350,XVII.,"Yet knew, if this were true, the threat he made"
1351,XVII.,"To gain Ruth from him, would have been in vain."
1352,XVII.,"And so, because he feared to lose his power,"
1353,XVII.,He kept his secret that the deed was lost.

1355,PART SECOND.,PART SECOND.
1356,PART SECOND.,
1357,PART SECOND.,Now through the mighty pulses of the land
1358,PART SECOND.,Throbbed the dark blood of war; and Sumter's guns
1359,PART SECOND.,Were the first heart-beats of a better day.
1360,PART SECOND.,"The avenging angel, with a scourging sword"
1361,PART SECOND.,"Of fire and death, with triumph on his face,"
1362,PART SECOND.,Swept o'er the nation with the cry of War!
1363,PART SECOND.,"Ten thousand boroughs, dreaming peace, awake."

1369,PART SECOND.,"In truth's great court, vain has thy trial been,"
1370,PART SECOND.,For no divorce could there be granted thee.
1371,PART SECOND.,"The child you bore was bitter curse and shame,"
1372,PART SECOND.,"And not the child of thy husband, the North."
1373,PART SECOND.,"It has led thee to miry paths, and raised"

1377,I.,I.
1378,I.,
1379,I.,The first year of the war had passed away
1380,I.,"When Richard Wain, the planter, sprang to arms."
1381,I.,The day for his departure had been set;
1382,I.,"To-morrow it would be, and as the night"
1383,I.,"Fell on the misty hills, and on the vales,"
1384,I.,He sat alone in his accustomed room;
1385,I.,"Thinking, he drowsed; his chin couched on his breast;"
1386,I.,A dim light wrought at shadows on the walls.
1387,I.,Slowly the sash was raised behind him there.
1388,I.,"Perhaps he slept; he did not heed the noise,"
1389,I.,"And Karagwe sprang in, and faced his foe."
1390,I.,"He held a long knife up and brandished it,"
1391,I.,"And said, ""As surely as you call or move,"
1392,I.,Tour life will not be worth a blade of grass;
1393,I.,"But if you do not call, and sign the words,"
1394,I.,"That I have written on a paper here,"
1395,I.,"No harm will come, and I shall go away."""
1396,I.,He drew the paper forth; the planter read:
1397,I.,_I promise if the deed is ever found
1398,I.,"Of Dalton Earl's estate, I in no way"
1399,I.,Shall lay a claim to it to make it mine.
1400,I.,I here surrender all my right to it._
1401,I.,
1402,I.,"""Why, this I shall not sign, of course,"" he said."
1403,I.,"""You might have asked me to give back your Ruth,"
1404,I.,And I would not have minded; but your game
1405,I.,"Lies deeper than a check upon the queen."""
1406,I.,
1407,I.,"""Sign!"" cried the negro; and at Ruth's name,"
1408,I.,"A sudden madness leaped along his nerves,"
1409,I.,Like flame among the dry prairie grass.
1410,I.,"""Sign! for unless you sign this writing now,"
1411,I.,"You shall not live; now promise me to sign!"""
1412,I.,"He caught the planter fiercely by the throat,"
1413,I.,"Starting his quailing eyes, ""Now will you sign or not?"
1414,I.,"You have ten seconds more to make your choice."""
1415,I.,
1416,I.,"""Give me the paper then, and I will sign."""
1417,I.,"The name was written, and the negro went;"
1418,I.,"But not an hour had passed, before the hounds"
1419,I.,"Of Richard Wain and Dalton Earl were slipped,"
1420,I.,And scenting on his track through stream and field.
1421,I.,
1422,II.,II.
1423,II.,
1424,II.,The slave first ran toward the hollow tree;
1425,II.,"There left the paper signed by Richard Wain,"
1426,II.,"Disturbing not the deed; but took the Book,"
1427,II.,"And up the tireless road, tied on and on,"
1428,II.,Until he gained the borders of a marsh.
1429,II.,
1430,II.,"The night was dark, but darker still the clouds"
1431,II.,That loomed along the rim where day had gone.
1432,II.,"The wind blew cold, and hastened quickly past,"
1433,II.,"Escaping, like a slave, the hound-like clouds"
1434,II.,Whose thunder-barkings sounded in its ears.
1435,II.,
1436,II.,"And Karagwe had only reached the marsh,"
1437,II.,When on his track he heard the savage dogs.
1438,II.,"He knew the paths and windings many miles,"
1439,II.,"And even in the darkness found his way,"
1440,II.,"And gained a covert island, where a hut,"
1441,II.,"Built by some poor and friendless fugitive,"
1442,II.,Afforded shelter and secure abode.
1443,II.,He tarried here until along the hills
1444,II.,The red-lipped whisper of the morning ran.
1445,II.,"Then, when he would have ventured from the door,"
1446,II.,"A large black hound arose, and licked his hand."
1447,II.,The dog was Dalton Earl's; he started back.
1448,II.,
1449,II.,The dream of freedom nourished many years
1450,II.,"Seemed withering, and for the moment lost."
1451,II.,"For long the slave had thought of liberty,"
1452,II.,"And worshipped her, as in that elder time"
1453,II.,"A tyrant's subjects worshipped, praying her"
1454,II.,"That she would not delay, but hasten forth,"
1455,II.,"And bridge the hated gulf 'twixt rich and poor,"
1456,II.,"By freeing all the mass from ignorance,"
1457,II.,"By lifting up the worthy of the earth,"
1458,II.,And making knowledge paramount to wealth.
1459,II.,
1460,III.,III.
1461,III.,
1462,III.,"O strange, that in our age, and in a land"
1463,III.,"Where liberty was laid the corner-stone,"
1464,III.,"A slave, perforce, should be obliged to dream,"
1465,III.,"And dote on freedom, like the poor oppressed"
1466,III.,Who lived and hoped two thousand years ago!
1467,III.,
1468,III.,And slavery to this slave was like a fruit--
1469,III.,A bitter and a hateful fruit to taste--
1470,III.,"The fruit of error and of ignorance,"
1471,III.,Made rank with superstition and with crime.
1472,III.,
1473,III.,"Yet though the fruit was bitter to the core,"
1474,III.,Many there were who died for love of it.
1475,III.,"O, many they who listen through long nights"
1476,III.,To hear a footstep that will never come.
1477,III.,"There is not a flower along the border blown,"
1478,III.,"From Lookout Mountain to the Chesapeake,"
1479,III.,But has in it the blood of North and South.
1480,III.,
1481,IV.,IV.
1482,IV.,
1483,IV.,"Karagwe went back, and on a paper wrote,--"
1484,IV.,"""Your dog has harmed me not, and why should you,"
1485,IV.,"That I have never wronged, plot harm to me?"
1486,IV.,"You made me slave, you sold away my bride,"
1487,IV.,"And now you set your hounds upon my track,"
1488,IV.,Because I seek the freedom that is mine.
1489,IV.,"Though you have wronged me, still I do you good,"
1490,IV.,"For in an oak, the largest of the grove,"
1491,IV.,"Upon the cotton-field of Richard Wain,"
1492,IV.,"Hid in a hollow near the second limb,"
1493,IV.,"Is the lost deed that holds your house and lands."""
1494,IV.,"The paper fastened round the hound's strong neck,"
1495,IV.,"The negro bade him go, and forth he went;"
1496,IV.,"And Earl read what the slave had written down,"
1497,IV.,"And that day found the deed hid in the tree,"
1498,IV.,And that day ceased pursuing any more.
1499,IV.,
1500,IV.,For two long weeks the negro in the swamps
1501,IV.,"Wandered toward the North, living at times"
1502,IV.,On berries and on fruit. Above him leaned
1503,IV.,"The tall trees, bower-like 'neath their wrestling arms;"
1504,IV.,"Beneath, the murky waters, black as death,"
1505,IV.,Stirred only to the plunge of venomed things.
1506,IV.,"The long, seared grasses clung to every bough"
1507,IV.,Whose trailing robe hung near the sluggish lymph.
1508,IV.,"And here and there, among the savage moss,"
1509,IV.,"Blossomed alone some snowy gold-spired flower,"
1510,IV.,Like God's own church found in a heathen land.
1511,IV.,"The birds o'erhead, that, plumaged like the morn,"
1512,IV.,"Caroled their sweetness, sang the holy psalms."
1513,IV.,
1514,V.,V.
1515,V.,
1516,V.,But now across his path the negro found
1517,V.,A belt of water falling with the tide.
1518,V.,"Two heavy logs he lashed, and launched them out,"
1519,V.,"Then, with a pole for help in case of need,"
1520,V.,"Sprang on the float, and drifted down the stream."
1521,V.,"Thus for two days he drifted, eating naught"
1522,V.,Except the berries growing near the shore.
1523,V.,"Then on a cool, bright morning, when the wind"
1524,V.,"And tide agreed, he saw again the sea."
1525,V.,"Far off a buoy was tossing on the waves,"
1526,V.,Much like the red heart of the joyful deep--
1527,V.,Much like a heart upon a sea of life;
1528,V.,"And ships were in the offing, sailing on"
1529,V.,Like the vague ships that with our hopes and fears
1530,V.,Put from their harbors to return no more.
1531,V.,
1532,VI.,VI.
1533,VI.,
1534,VI.,The raft went oceanward. The negro raised
1535,VI.,"Upon the pole the coat that he had worn,"
1536,VI.,Hoping for succor from the distant ships;
1537,VI.,"And not in vain; for ere the sun had set,"
1538,VI.,"Half starved, he clambered up a vessel's side,"
1539,VI.,"And found himself with friends, and on his way"
1540,VI.,"To freedom, 'neath the steadfast northern star."
1541,VI.,
1542,VII.,VII.
1543,VII.,
1544,VII.,"Two years of war, two years of many tears,"
1545,VII.,"And Richard Wain, a captain of renown,"
1546,VII.,"In ranks led on by error, fought and fell."
1547,VII.,
1548,VII.,"Within the breast of Coralline, Stanley Thane"
1549,VII.,Possessed acknowledged empire; all her love
1550,VII.,"Was poured out on him, and her heart"
1551,VII.,Stood like an emptied vase. Then from the North
1552,VII.,"Came rumors of his daring, and the war"
1553,VII.,"Gloomed like a night about her,--he its star."
1554,VII.,
1555,VIII.,VIII.
1556,VIII.,
1557,VIII.,"The golden spirit in each lily bloom,"
1558,VIII.,"That, pollen-vestured, laughs at care all day"
1559,VIII.,Had closed the doors and shutters of its house.
1560,VIII.,"Forth in the dewy garden, 'neath the stars,"
1561,VIII.,"Walked Coralline and Ruth, sad and alone;"
1562,VIII.,For Ruth was owned again by Dalton Earl.
1563,VIII.,
1564,VIII.,"""I grieve,"" said Coralline, ""that Stanley Thane"
1565,VIII.,"Left me so rashly, and that he thinks"
1566,VIII.,My hasty words were said with earnest thought.
1567,VIII.,Would that a bird might fly to him and sing--
1568,VIII.,"'She loves you still, Stanley, she loves you still.'"""
1569,VIII.,
1570,VIII.,"Ruth followed quickly, ""Your wish is heard;"
1571,VIII.,"For I will go to him who once was here,"
1572,VIII.,"And say to him the words that you have said."""
1573,VIII.,"Then fell the other on the quadroon's neck,"
1574,VIII.,"And kissed her through her tears, and promised her"
1575,VIII.,"Her freedom, if she went to Stanley Thane."
1576,VIII.,"She did not dream what impulse urged the slave,"
1577,VIII.,Nor that in sending her toward the North
1578,VIII.,"Bearing a message full of trust and love,"
1579,VIII.,She sent a message smeared with blood instead.
1580,VIII.,
1581,VIII.,For Ruth hoped now for vengeance for her past.
1582,VIII.,"Wronged by her father, she would wreak her hate"
1583,VIII.,"Full on her sister, and destroy her peace,"
1584,VIII.,As hers had been destroyed in dark dead days.
1585,VIII.,
1586,IX.,IX.
1587,IX.,
1588,IX.,"That night she stole a knife, and sharpened it,"
1589,IX.,"And while she drew it up and down the stone,"
1590,IX.,Sipped from the poison nectar of revenge.
1591,IX.,"She thought of Stanley Thane, and pitied him"
1592,IX.,That he should be the victim of her hate;
1593,IX.,"But wished that Coralline could see him then,"
1594,IX.,"After the violent knife had done its work,"
1595,IX.,Laid out and ready for his last abode.
1596,IX.,
1597,X.,X.
1598,X.,
1599,X.,"So Ruth arose, and when the wine-lipped Dawn,"
1600,X.,"Gathering his robes about him like a god,"
1601,X.,Went up to the great summits of the world
1602,X.,"From the black valleys of immeasurable space,"
1603,X.,She passed beyond the limit of the vale.
1604,X.,
1605,X.,Those she loved best had all been torn away;
1606,X.,"The last, her child, was sold she knew not where;"
1607,X.,"And Coralline too should taste a bitter cup,"
1608,X.,Feeling the fury of a deep revenge.
1609,X.,
1610,XI.,XI.
1611,XI.,
1612,XI.,"For many days Ruth journeyed to the North,"
1613,XI.,"And reached at last the camp. She passed the guard,"
1614,XI.,And in the night discovered Stanley's tent;
1615,XI.,"Then gliding in, bent o'er him while he slept."
1616,XI.,"He dreamed of Coralline, and in his sleep"
1617,XI.,"Said--""Coralline, 'tis better to forgive."""
1618,XI.,"And Ruth who heard, cried, ""She forgives;"
1619,XI.,"She loves you still, Stanley--she loves you still!"""
1620,XI.,"At this he woke, and saw the woman there,"
1621,XI.,"And saw the weapon raised above his breast,"
1622,XI.,And a vague horror at the mockery of the words
1623,XI.,"Left him all powerless, and sealed up his speech."
1624,XI.,"But one swift hand passed in and grasped the arm,"
1625,XI.,"And snatched the knife, and there before them stood"

2236,THE SPIDER.,"We ran our best along the barren shore,"
2237,THE SPIDER.,"And gained his silent cottage. Entering,"
2238,THE SPIDER.,He led me to his daughter's vacant couch.
2239,THE SPIDER.,"The room had but one window, and the sash"
2240,THE SPIDER.,Was raised. I looked out to the ground beneath.
2241,THE SPIDER.,"A vine crept up, and with long fingers made"

2243,THE SPIDER.,And o'er the window threw a leafy scarf.
2244,THE SPIDER.,"But what was this, that fastened to the ledge"

2246,THE SPIDER.,Twisted with five strands. This the fisherman

2250,THE SPIDER.,What was best to do?
2251,THE SPIDER.,"We saw strange foot-prints on the moistened beach,"

2254,THE SPIDER.,"We sought among the tombs, up from the dell;"
2255,THE SPIDER.,"But unrewarded, when the sun was quenched,"
2256,THE SPIDER.,"Sat down to weep. So darkness dropped,"
2257,THE SPIDER.,"And like an awful spider, o'er the earth"

2261,THE SPIDER.,"The night was warm, and with my window raised,"

2263,THE SPIDER.,No light was in the house. I half reclined--
2264,THE SPIDER.,My back toward the window. Something shut
2265,THE SPIDER.,The puny sheen of starlight from the room.
2266,THE SPIDER.,"The Thing, a monstrous shape, was with me there,"
2267,THE SPIDER.,And two hard arms were thrown about my waist.
2268,THE SPIDER.,"For very terror I was hushed, nor moved"
2269,THE SPIDER.,To cast my foe off. I was in the arms
2270,THE SPIDER.,"Of the strong spider. As we went, I grew"

2276,THE SPIDER.,And silvered all the Panticapean vale.
2277,THE SPIDER.,The funnel of the web was in the mouth
2278,THE SPIDER.,"Of a vast tomb, whose outside, hewn on rock,"
2279,THE SPIDER.,Outlined a Gorgon's face with jaws agape--
2280,THE SPIDER.,"Some stern Medusa, Stheno, or Euryale,"
2281,THE SPIDER.,Changed to the stone that in the elder days
2282,THE SPIDER.,She changed the sons of men who looked on her.
2283,THE SPIDER.,"We passed the funnel, entering the tomb."
2284,THE SPIDER.,"About my arms the spider threw his cords,"
2285,THE SPIDER.,"And shackled them. I dared not move, but lay"
2286,THE SPIDER.,"Upon the smooth stone floor, inured to fear."
2287,THE SPIDER.,I fancied now that I was safe till dawn.
2288,THE SPIDER.,If I could use my hands I then might find
2289,THE SPIDER.,"Some weapon of defense, some club, or stone,"
2290,THE SPIDER.,And so resist with some small chance for life.
2291,THE SPIDER.,The thought bred strength. I slowly drew my arms
2292,THE SPIDER.,"Upon my sides, and, with persistence, gained"
2293,THE SPIDER.,"Their freedom; though about the wrists, the flesh"
2294,THE SPIDER.,"Was bruised and harrowed, and my blood made wet"
2295,THE SPIDER.,The spider's cord wherewith I had been bound.
2296,THE SPIDER.,
2297,THE SPIDER.,"The night seemed endless. As it came to dawn,"
2298,THE SPIDER.,A faint moan woke an echo in the tomb.
2299,THE SPIDER.,"The echo seemed a cry of pity, sent"
2300,THE SPIDER.,"For solace to the moan. As light grew strong,"
2301,THE SPIDER.,"I saw, not far from where I had been laid,"
2302,THE SPIDER.,"A maiden sitting. All her hair set free,"
2303,THE SPIDER.,She made of it a pillow as she leaned
2304,THE SPIDER.,Against the painted wall. My heart threw wide
2305,THE SPIDER.,"To her my arms, his hospitable doors;"
2306,THE SPIDER.,"The guest within, at once the doors were shut."
2307,THE SPIDER.,
2308,THE SPIDER.,"The sun came up, and spread a cloth of gold"
2309,THE SPIDER.,"Over the sea. We saw the vale beneath,"
2310,THE SPIDER.,"And there the town, and fancied where, among"
2311,THE SPIDER.,"The trees upon the shore, her cottage stood;"
2312,THE SPIDER.,Then hoped 'gainst hope to enter it again.
2313,THE SPIDER.,"Two thousand years ago, this distant sea"
2314,THE SPIDER.,Teemed with the thrifty commerce of the world.
2315,THE SPIDER.,"When Athens was, and when her scholars cut,"
2316,THE SPIDER.,"With thoughts of iron, their own deathless names"
2317,THE SPIDER.,"Into the stone page of fame, this vale beneath"
2318,THE SPIDER.,"Held a great city. These, its tombs, endure."
2319,THE SPIDER.,There is no better scoff at the parade
2320,THE SPIDER.,"And vanity of life, than that a tomb suggests."
2321,THE SPIDER.,
2322,THE SPIDER.,"While we looked forth on the historic view,"
2323,THE SPIDER.,We saw the subtle spider throw his cord
2324,THE SPIDER.,Over an eagle tangled in the web.
2325,THE SPIDER.,"The eagle fought, not mildly overcome,"
2326,THE SPIDER.,"And spread his wings, and darted his sharp beak."
2327,THE SPIDER.,"At last the spider caught him by the neck,"
2328,THE SPIDER.,"With his serrated claws that grew like horns,"
2329,THE SPIDER.,"And killed him; then plucked the vanquished plumes,"
2330,THE SPIDER.,And sucked the warm blood from the sundered ends.
2331,THE SPIDER.,From this we knew the monster brought us here
2332,THE SPIDER.,"To serve a hideous banquet, and that one"
2333,THE SPIDER.,"Must need be near, and see the other slain."
2334,THE SPIDER.,
2335,THE SPIDER.,"The web was like the sail of some large ship,"
2336,THE SPIDER.,"And reached forth from the Gorgon's open mouth,"
2337,THE SPIDER.,"On either side, to boughs of blighted trees."
2338,THE SPIDER.,"Birds were caught in it, and about the place"
2339,THE SPIDER.,"Wherein the spider hid to watch for prey,"
2340,THE SPIDER.,Their bones lay bleaching in the sun and rain.
2341,THE SPIDER.,"Upon the web the winds laid violent hands,"
2342,THE SPIDER.,"And tugged at it, but lacked the sinewed strength"
2343,THE SPIDER.,To tear it or divorce it from its place.
2344,THE SPIDER.,"The rain left on it when the sun came up,"
2345,THE SPIDER.,"Dyed the vast cloth with all prismatic hues,"
2346,THE SPIDER.,And made it glitter like the silken sail
2347,THE SPIDER.,Of Cleopatra's barge.
2348,THE SPIDER.,
2349,THE SPIDER.,We felt quite sure
2350,THE SPIDER.,The eagle's death bequeathed new lease of life.
2351,THE SPIDER.,"We cast about at once, in hope to find"
2352,THE SPIDER.,Some object for defense. The tomb was strange.
2353,THE SPIDER.,Alone the spider could have known of it.
2354,THE SPIDER.,"A rich sarcophagus stood in the midst,"
2355,THE SPIDER.,"Of deftly inlaid woods, or carved, or bronzed."
2356,THE SPIDER.,"Within, a skeleton, its white skull crowned"
2357,THE SPIDER.,"With gold bestarred with diamonds, chilled my blood."
2358,THE SPIDER.,"A bronze lamp, cast to represent the beast"
2359,THE SPIDER.,"Slain by Bellerophon, the Chimæra,"
2360,THE SPIDER.,Was on the floor; and from its lion's mouth
2361,THE SPIDER.,"The flame had issued, like the flame of life"
2362,THE SPIDER.,That flickered and went out with him gold-crowned.
2363,THE SPIDER.,"A target stood near by, and on it clashed"
2364,THE SPIDER.,"Griffon and stag, adverse as right and wrong."
2365,THE SPIDER.,"About, lay cups of onyx set in gold."
2366,THE SPIDER.,"On conic jars were bacchanalian scenes,--"
2367,THE SPIDER.,"Nude chubby Bacchi, grotesque leering fauns,"
2368,THE SPIDER.,All linked 'neath vines that grew important grapes;
2369,THE SPIDER.,And in the jars were rings and flowers of gold.
2370,THE SPIDER.,"We found twin ear-drops cut from choicest stone,"
2371,THE SPIDER.,"Metallic mirrors, and a statuette"
2372,THE SPIDER.,Of amorous Dido naked to the waist.
2373,THE SPIDER.,"Life is a harp, and all its nervous strings,"
2374,THE SPIDER.,"Touched by the fingers of the fear of death,"
2375,THE SPIDER.,Jar with pathetic music. Having found
2376,THE SPIDER.,No trusty implement to bar the way
2377,THE SPIDER.,"Of threatening peril, we embraced,"
2378,THE SPIDER.,"And kissed with silent kisses mixed with tears,"
2379,THE SPIDER.,And waited for the end.
2380,THE SPIDER.,
2381,THE SPIDER.,"When no more,"
2382,THE SPIDER.,"Hope, like an eagle in the mountain air,"
2383,THE SPIDER.,"Soars in time's future, it mounts up with wings"
2384,THE SPIDER.,Toward the unmapped city walled by death.
2385,THE SPIDER.,Thither the eagle of our hope took flight.
2386,THE SPIDER.,
2387,THE SPIDER.,The sun was in the zenith. His back
2388,THE SPIDER.,"Toward us, crouched the spider, at the mouth"
2389,THE SPIDER.,Of our strange prison on the towering cliff.
2390,THE SPIDER.,The spider's shape was full a fathom long.
2391,THE SPIDER.,"Two parts it had, the fore part, head and breast;"
2392,THE SPIDER.,"The hinder part, the trunk. The first was black,"
2393,THE SPIDER.,"But all the last was covered with short hair,"
2394,THE SPIDER.,Yellow and fine. Eight sprawling legs adhered
2395,THE SPIDER.,"To his tough breast. Eight eyes were in his head,"
2396,THE SPIDER.,"Two in the front, and three on either side;"
2397,THE SPIDER.,"They had no eyelids, and were never closed,"
2398,THE SPIDER.,Protected by a strong transparent nail.
2399,THE SPIDER.,His pincers grew between his foremost eyes--
2400,THE SPIDER.,"Were toothed like saws, were venomous, and sharp,"
2401,THE SPIDER.,With claws on either end. Two arms stretched out
2402,THE SPIDER.,"From his mailed shoulders, and with these he caught"
2403,THE SPIDER.,"His tangled prey, or guided what he spun."
2404,THE SPIDER.,"Slowly the monster turned, and glared at us,"
2405,THE SPIDER.,"Working his arms, and opening his claws,"
2406,THE SPIDER.,Then moved toward us fiercely for attack.
2407,THE SPIDER.,We ran to gain the limit of the tomb
2408,THE SPIDER.,"Where darkness was; there as we crouched with dread,"
2409,THE SPIDER.,My foot struck some hard substance. In despair
2410,THE SPIDER.,"I grasped at it, and with great joy upheld"
2411,THE SPIDER.,"An ancient sword!--surely, a sharp, bold tooth"
2412,THE SPIDER.,"To bite the spider. I would sink it deep,"
2413,THE SPIDER.,"Up to the gum of the crossed guard. Alert,"
2414,THE SPIDER.,"I sprang upon the monster as he came,"
2415,THE SPIDER.,And with one blow cut off his brutish head.
2416,THE SPIDER.,"He writhed awhile with pain, but in the end,"
2417,THE SPIDER.,"Drew up the eight long legs and two thick arms,"
2418,THE SPIDER.,"And rolling over on his useless back,"
2419,THE SPIDER.,Died with a pang.
2420,THE SPIDER.,
2421,THE SPIDER.,"So we issued forth,"
2422,THE SPIDER.,"And the green earth seemed happy to be free,"
2423,THE SPIDER.,And glad the sky cloud-frescoed 'gainst the blue.
2424,THE SPIDER.,"We sought the sea-side cottage, where the chief"
2425,THE SPIDER.,Clasped once again his daughter to his breast.
2426,THE SPIDER.,"Down from the hill we fetched the spider slain,"
2427,THE SPIDER.,And I to science gave these simple facts:
2428,THE SPIDER.,"Spiders have no antennæ, therefore rank"
2429,THE SPIDER.,Not with the insects. As they breathe with gills
2430,THE SPIDER.,"Beneath the body, they possess a heart."
2431,THE SPIDER.,"The treasure of the tomb brought wealth to us,"
2432,THE SPIDER.,And we who loved were wed one golden day;
2433,THE SPIDER.,"And the great Czar hearing our story told,"
2434,THE SPIDER.,Sent presents to the bride of silk and pearls.
2435,THE SPIDER.,
2436,GRACE BERNARD.,GRACE BERNARD.
2437,GRACE BERNARD.,
2438,GRACE BERNARD.,I know the drift and purpose of the years;
2439,GRACE BERNARD.,"The will, which is the magnet of the soul,"
2440,GRACE BERNARD.,"Shall yet attain new powers, and man"
2441,GRACE BERNARD.,Be something more than man. The husks fall off;
2442,GRACE BERNARD.,"Old civilizations pass, the new come on."
2443,GRACE BERNARD.,
2444,I.,I.
2445,I.,
2446,I.,"There are two farms which, smiling in the sun,"
2447,I.,"Adjoin each other, as I trust, some day"
2448,I.,"Two hearts will join, who from their bounty live."
2449,I.,"One farm is John Bernard's, and one is mine;"
2450,I.,"And she, the one pearl woman in my eyes,"
2451,I.,"Is his sweet daughter, gentle Grace Bernard."
2452,I.,
2453,I.,"Three years ago, my father followed her"
2454,I.,Who gave me birth home to his narrow house.
2455,I.,"I was at college when death's summons came,"
2456,I.,"And all the grief fell on me, crushing me;"
2457,I.,"And all my heart cried out in bitterness,"
2458,I.,"Moaning to cease with its wet language,--tears."
2459,I.,Then with my prospects of professional life
2460,I.,"Thwarted and void, I came back to the farm--"
2461,I.,I came back to the love of Grace Bernard.
2462,I.,She was the dove that on the flood of grief
2463,I.,Brought to my window there love's olive spray.
2464,I.,From college to the farm-house where I dwelt
2465,I.,"I took my books, friends who are never cold,"
2466,I.,"With fragile instruments of chemistry,"
2467,I.,And cabinets of mineral and rock
2468,I.,With limestone encrinites; asterias
2469,I.,"Old as the mountains, or the sea's white lash"
2470,I.,Wherewith he smites the shoulders of the shore;
2471,I.,"Tarentula and scarabee I brought,"
2472,I.,"And, too, I brought my diamond microscope"
2473,I.,"Which magnifies a pin's head to a man's,"
2474,I.,And gives me sights in water and in air
2475,I.,The naturalists have not yet touched upon.
2476,I.,"Over my fields I wander frequently,"
2477,I.,Breaking the past's upturned face of shelving rocks
2478,I.,For special specimens to fill my home;
2479,I.,"But find my footsteps always thither tend,"
2480,I.,"Toward the farm-house of the other farm,"
2481,I.,Where Grace Bernard is noontime and delight.
2482,I.,
2483,I.,"When first I took the hand of her I love,"
2484,I.,"And held it only as a stranger might,"
2485,I.,"Some unseen mentor whispered in my ear,"
2486,I.,"_You twain are strands which Destiny shall braid_,"
2487,I.,"And then a numb misgiving, not explained,"
2488,I.,Settled with chilly dampness on my heart.
2489,I.,"My Grace Bernard in Grace was not misnamed,"
2490,I.,There was a soft Madonna look about her eyes;
2491,I.,"The long thick lash, the drooping-petal lid,"
2492,I.,Wrought on her face all love and tenderness.
2493,I.,Her lips were of that deep intensest red
2494,I.,"The cherry, red rose, and columbine wear."
2495,I.,"Her golden hair was sunshine changed to silk,"
2496,I.,"Which fell below her waist, and was a thing"
2497,I.,"Perhaps some lover, braver far than I,"
2498,I.,"Might dare to mesh his hands in, or to kiss."
2499,I.,
2500,II.,II.
2501,II.,
2502,II.,"The Spring has come and brought her affluent days,"
2503,II.,But in the air a rumor runs of death--
2504,II.,A pestilence is half across the sea.
2505,II.,"The presses blare its probable approach,"
2506,II.,And poverty and wealth alike forebode.
2507,II.,"The cholera it is whispered, Asia-born,"
2508,II.,May leave more vacant chairs about our hearths
2509,II.,Than the red havoc of internal war.
2510,II.,There is no foot it may not overtake;
2511,II.,There is no cheek which may not blanch for it.
2512,II.,"It is Filth's daughter, and where the low"
2513,II.,"Huddle in impure air in narrow rooms,"
2514,II.,"There it must come. As all forms of life,"
2515,II.,"Animate and inanimate, originate"
2516,II.,"In seeds and eggs, so all infection does."
2517,II.,The floating gases in the atmosphere
2518,II.,"Acting on particles which from filth arise,"
2519,II.,"Mingle with foul wedlock--germinate,"
2520,II.,"And bear their seed like grain, or breed like flies."
2521,II.,"This product, scattered on the spotless air,"
2522,II.,"And hurried on the currents of the wind,"
2523,II.,"Is breathed by human beings, near and far;"
2524,II.,"And planted in the system, the disease"
2525,II.,"Ripens and grows, until the sufferer dies."
2526,II.,Yellow fever is vegetable disease
2527,II.,Because the sharp frost kills it. Cholera
2528,II.,"Is animal in origin, and survives"
2529,II.,"The utmost cold of long, dark winter days."
2530,II.,
2531,II.,"I pray that if the cholera must come,"
2532,II.,It will not touch my Grace who is so dear;
2533,II.,"But that we twain may at the altar stand,"
2534,II.,"And outlive many a trouble in the air,"
2535,II.,And gather many a day of happiness and peace.
2536,II.,
2537,III.,III.
2538,III.,
2539,III.,"Down by the brook which separates the farms,"
2540,III.,"Is a great rock that leans above the stream,"
2541,III.,"And seems some monster of the Saurian day,"
2542,III.,"That coming to the water's edge to drink,"
2543,III.,"Was petrified, and so is leaning still."
2544,III.,"Upon its back a week ago I sat,"
2545,III.,"And dreamed of Grace Bernard, and watched the brook;"
2546,III.,And while I dreamed there came within the dream
2547,III.,A premonition of what yet would be.
2548,III.,"The future's face, forever turned away,"
2549,III.,"Now seemed reverted, and its backward look"
2550,III.,Was bent on me.
2551,III.,
2552,III.,They took a faulty cast
2553,III.,Of Shakespeare's features after he was dead.
2554,III.,"I, seeing the future's face, make here my cast."
2555,III.,
2556,III.,And this the premonition that was mine--
2557,III.,A perfect premonition full and clear--
2558,III.,"And as I know the persons it concerns,"
2559,III.,"I cannot think it all improbable,"
2560,III.,"So write it down, that when the time has passed,"
2561,III.,I may compare the facts with what is here.
2562,III.,"And yet I scarcely should have written this,"
2563,III.,Had I not seen his haunting face to-day--
2564,III.,"That face which I had never seen before,"
2565,III.,Except in my one dream upon the rock
2566,III.,"That leans, athirst, above the brimming stream."
2567,III.,
2568,III.,"The soldier, when he goes to meet the foe,"
2569,III.,"May darkly understand that death is near,"
2570,III.,Yet bravely marches on to destiny.
2571,III.,I too behold a shadow in my path;
2572,III.,"I too go on, nor waver in my way."

2574,THE PREMONITION.,THE PREMONITION.
2575,THE PREMONITION.,
2576,I.,I.
2577,I.,
2578,I.,"Far off, across the turbulence of waves,"
2579,I.,"I seem to see a wife upon her knees,"
2580,I.,Her supplicating hands outstretched to one
2581,I.,Who strikes her with coarse blows on cheek and breast.
2582,I.,"He is her husband, and he leaves her there,"
2583,I.,"And takes her jewels and her only purse,"
2584,I.,And in a ship embarks for other shores.
2585,I.,His is the face that I have seen to-day--
2586,I.,A handsome face whatever be its sins:
2587,I.,"A firm mouth, with large wandering black eyes,"
2588,I.,"A bearded under-lip, and snowy teeth;"
2589,I.,"Long, fine black hair, which idly falls about"
2590,I.,Shoulders that stoop from labor over books;
2591,I.,"Withal a high and intellectual brow,"
2592,I.,Not broad enough to hold a generous soul.
2593,I.,
2594,II.,II.
2595,II.,
2596,II.,I see the farm-house where my Grace abides;
2597,II.,"The afternoon is clear, the grass is green;"
2598,II.,And Grace comes forth and walks toward the brook.
2599,II.,"Beside its bank, which is a slope of moss,"
2600,II.,I see the face intent upon the scene.
2601,II.,"Now Grace draws near, and starting back to find"
2602,II.,"A stranger in the dell she loves the most,"
2603,II.,"Is half attracted by his cultured mien,"
2604,II.,And half repelled by inconsistent fears.
2605,II.,"He rises, bowing low, and begs to speak:"
2606,II.,He has not seen such beauty in his life;
2607,II.,"He craves to touch a finger of her hand,"
2608,II.,"To judge if she be of the earth, or one"
2609,II.,Upon some holy mission from that land
2610,II.,"Whereto, with fastings and with many prayers,"
2611,II.,Through God's good grace he hopes yet to attain.
2612,II.,
2613,II.,"Then John Bernard, who has been working near,"
2614,II.,"Seeding the furrows for his empty barns,"
2615,II.,This stranger and my Grace puts hand in hand.
2616,II.,I see her smile in answer to his smiles.
2617,II.,She makes her ears his cells for honeyed speech;
2618,II.,And yet she seems to fear him for some cause.
2619,II.,"Now, as the slow sun tarries on the hills,"
2620,II.,I see them parting at the farm-house door--
2621,II.,The wide half-door which now is opened half--
2622,II.,"And as he passes down the bordered path,"
2623,II.,"His kiss still lingering upon her hand,"
2624,II.,"She leans out from the door, and watches him"
2625,II.,Until he vanishes between the trees.
2626,II.,"I seem to see her face, a trouble sweet"
2627,II.,"Dwelling upon it, even though the light"
2628,II.,"Sets it in glory, with a slender ring"
2629,II.,Above the white brow and the golden hair.
2630,II.,
2631,III.,III.
2632,III.,
2633,III.,I see them riding down the village street:
2634,III.,"He on a horse as black and strong as iron,"
2635,III.,"She on her snowy palfrey, robed in green,"
2636,III.,Slack reins in hand; the horses side by side.
2637,III.,"Even as I see and write, my heart grows cold--"
2638,III.,Cold as a bird that on a winter's day
2639,III.,"Breasts the bleak wind, high in the biting air."
2640,III.,
2641,IV.,IV.
2642,IV.,
2643,IV.,I see a city with a concourse vast
2644,IV.,"Of gas-lit streets and buildings, and above,"
2645,IV.,"Its dear face buried in its cloudy hands,"
2646,IV.,"The Night bends over, weeping. In the street"
2647,IV.,I see the face again I saw to-day.
2648,IV.,
2649,IV.,I see him writing in a narrow room.
2650,IV.,I read the words:
2651,IV.,_To-night I end my life.
2652,IV.,"The river says ""Embrace, I offer rest."""
2653,IV.,"The world and I have grappled in fair fight,"
2654,IV.,"And I am beaten. Having found defeat,"
2655,IV.,I long to go down to its lowest depths.
2656,IV.,"I only ask, that those who find these words,"
2657,IV.,Will send them to my people past the sea;
2658,IV.,"To-night I cross a wider: so, adieu._"

2660,MICHAEL GIANNI.,
2661,MICHAEL GIANNI.,"This is his true name,"
2662,MICHAEL GIANNI.,And afterward he writes his wife's address.
2663,MICHAEL GIANNI.,"He leaves the paper foldless on a stand,"
2664,MICHAEL GIANNI.,And then goes forth; but not to end his life.
2665,MICHAEL GIANNI.,He dreams that now his life is but begun.
2666,MICHAEL GIANNI.,He sees my Grace in all his coming days;
2667,MICHAEL GIANNI.,"He sees the large old farm-house where she dwells,"
2668,MICHAEL GIANNI.,"And therein hopes to happily pass the years,"

2674,MICHAEL GIANNI.,"First balancing on this side, then on that,"
2675,MICHAEL GIANNI.,Hazarding much to gain a paltry end;
2676,MICHAEL GIANNI.,"And if the rope of calculation breaks,"

2690,V.,"Beneath a rustic arbor, near her house,"
2691,V.,"Linked with sweet converse, sit two shadowed forms."
2692,V.,The new sword moon against the violet sky
2693,V.,"Is held aloft, by one white arm of cloud"
2694,V.,Raised from the sombre shoulder of a hill.
2695,V.,"My Grace and I are sitting in the bower,"
2696,V.,And down upon my breast and girdling arm
2697,V.,Is strewn pure gold--no alloy mixes it--
2698,V.,The pure ore of her lovable gold hair.
2699,V.,"The cunning weavers of Arabia,"
2700,V.,"Who seek to shuttle sunshine in their silk,"
2701,V.,"Would give its weight in diamonds for this hair,"
2702,V.,Whereof to make a fabric for their king.
2703,V.,
2704,V.,"I see the trees that skirt the yonder vale,"
2705,V.,"And where the road dents down between their arms,"
2706,V.,I see a figure passing to and fro.
2707,V.,"Now he comes near, and striding up the path"
2708,V.,"Enters the arbor, and discovers us."
2709,V.,It is Gianni; to his flashing eyes
2710,V.,"A fierce deep hatred leaps up from his heart,"
2711,V.,"As lightning, which forebodes the nearing storm,"
2712,V.,Leaps luridly above the midnight hills.
2713,V.,"With some excuse Gianni passes on,"
2714,V.,"While Grace, with sweetly growing confidence,"
2715,V.,"Whispers with lips which slightly touch my ear,"
2716,V.,"""I never loved him, I was always yours."""
2717,V.,
2718,VI.,VI.
2719,VI.,
2720,VI.,I see the parlor that my Grace adorns
2721,VI.,"With flowers and with her presence, which is far"
2722,VI.,Above the fragrant presence of all flowers.
2723,VI.,Grace sits at her piano; on her lips
2724,VI.,A song of twilight and the evening star.
2725,VI.,"There as the shadows slowly gather round,"
2726,VI.,"Gianni comes, and stops a moody hour;"
2727,VI.,"She, ice to his approaches; he, despair;"
2728,VI.,"But ere he goes, he places in her hand"
2729,VI.,"A large ripe orange, fresh from Sicily,"
2730,VI.,And begs her to accept it for his sake.
2731,VI.,"She bows him from the room, and puts the fruit"
2732,VI.,"Before her on her music, once again"
2733,VI.,"Dreaming of me, and singing some wild song"
2734,VI.,"Of Pan, who, by the river straying down,"
2735,VI.,"Cut reeds, and blew upon them with such power,"
2736,VI.,He charmed the lilies and the dragon-flies.
2737,VI.,"Now while the song is swaying to its close,"
2738,VI.,"I seem to come myself into the room,"
2739,VI.,And clasp true arms about my darling Grace;
2740,VI.,"She lays Gianni's orange in my hand,"
2741,VI.,And says that I must eat it; she would not
2742,VI.,"Have taken it, but that she did not wish"
2743,VI.,"To cross him with refusal. So I say,"
2744,VI.,"""Surely this stranger has peculiar taste"
2745,VI.,To bring an orange to you--only one.
2746,VI.,"Perhaps there is more in it than we know."""
2747,VI.,
2748,VII.,VII.
2749,VII.,
2750,VII.,"I seem to have this orange in my room,"
2751,VII.,And in the light of morning turn it round.
2752,VII.,I find no flaw in it on any side.
2753,VII.,"A goodly orange, ripe, with tender coat"
2754,VII.,"Of that deep reddish yellow, like fine gold."
2755,VII.,Perhaps the tree had wrapped its roots about
2756,VII.,"A chest of treasure, and had drawn the wealth"
2757,VII.,Into its heart to spend it on its fruit.
2758,VII.,"But while I slowly turn the orange round,"
2759,VII.,"And look more closely, lo, the slightest cut!--"
2760,VII.,A deep incision made by some sharp steel.
2761,VII.,"I carefully cut the rind, and without once"
2762,VII.,"Breaking the fine apartments of the fruit,"
2763,VII.,"Or spilling thence a drop of golden juice,"
2764,VII.,Find that one room through which the steel has passed.
2765,VII.,"This I dissect, and, testing as I can,"
2766,VII.,Fail to discover aught that's poisonous.
2767,VII.,
2768,VIII.,VIII.
2769,VIII.,
2770,VIII.,"I bring my microscope, and on a seed"
2771,VIII.,"Clinging with abject fear, I see a Shape"
2772,VIII.,"Whose wings are reeking with foul slime, whose eyes"
2773,VIII.,Glare with a demon lustre born of Pain.
2774,VIII.,"Its face has somewhat of the human shape,"
2775,VIII.,"The under-jaw too large, and bearded long;"
2776,VIII.,The forehead full of putrefying sores.
2777,VIII.,"Such front the Genius, Danhasch, may have worn."
2778,VIII.,It may be that the hideous face is like
2779,VIII.,"The idol Krishna's, from whose feasts depart,"
2780,VIII.,"Smitten with cholera, the Hindoo devotees."
2781,VIII.,The body oozes with a loathsome dew.
2782,VIII.,Its head is red as if sucked full of blood;
2783,VIII.,"But all the rest, its hundred legs, and tail,"
2784,VIII.,"The mailed back, and the wide-webbed prickly wings,"
2785,VIII.,"Are green, like those base eyes of jealousy"
2786,VIII.,Which hope to see a covert murder done.
2787,VIII.,"I find the finest needle in the house,"
2788,VIII.,And press the point down on the slimy hide.
2789,VIII.,"The blunt edge crushes, does not pierce the shape,"
2790,VIII.,And brings the straggle that I gloat to see.
2791,VIII.,"The legs stretch out, and work to get away;"
2792,VIII.,A barbed tongue and twin fangs drool from the mouth.
2793,VIII.,"The eyes protrude, and glare with deadly hate,"
2794,VIII.,Until they fix at last in stony calm.
2795,VIII.,
2796,VIII.,I ponder long on what this shape can be.
2797,VIII.,There is no doubt Gianni placed it here;
2798,VIII.,"If so, where has he caught and caged a thing"
2799,VIII.,The naked eye has not the power to see?
2800,VIII.,"Its uses must be deadly. In revenge,"
2801,VIII.,He hopes to take the life of her I love.
2802,VIII.,While poisons of another character
2803,VIII.,"Might be detected, this remains unknown."
2804,VIII.,"The Thing I have discovered--this vile Shape,"
2805,VIII.,Must be an atom of some foul disease!
2806,VIII.,And now I have the secret. For some days
2807,VIII.,"Gianni waits upon a stricken man,"
2808,VIII.,"Who dies, a victim of the cholera."
2809,VIII.,"In some strange manner he has found this germ,"
2810,VIII.,"And placed it in the orange, hoping thus"
2811,VIII.,To bring the dread disease to Grace Bernard.
2812,VIII.,
2813,IX.,IX.
2814,IX.,
2815,IX.,"I seem to be with him I hate, once more,"
2816,IX.,And now accuse him of the fiendish deed
2817,IX.,That I through chance averted. Now I too
2818,IX.,"Command him to return to his true wife,"
2819,IX.,"And no more cross my path; should he remain,"
2820,IX.,"He shall but wait to meet her, for my words"
2821,IX.,Already have been sent that he is here.
2822,IX.,
2823,X.,X.
2824,X.,
2825,X.,"I know that I shall fall sick dangerously,"
2826,X.,And in some way by dark Gianni's hand.
2827,X.,"I seem to lie asleep upon my bed,"
2828,X.,"And Grace is near, and watching my calm face."
2829,X.,"The village doctor makes his morning call,"
2830,X.,And takes my listless hand to feel the pulse.
2831,X.,There is no pulse! His hand goes to the heart.
2832,X.,"My heart has ceased to beat, and all is still."
2833,X.,The hand the doctor held drops down like lead.
2834,X.,"A looking-glass receives no fading mist,"
2835,X.,Laid on the icy and immovable lips.
2836,X.,My eyes are fixed; I glare upon them all.
2837,X.,"Grace twines her widowed arms about my neck,"
2838,X.,"Kissing my sallow cheeks, with hopeless tears,"
2839,X.,"Calling my name, and begging me come back;"
2840,X.,"So, thinking me dead, they close my staring eyes,"
2841,X.,"And put the face-cloth over my white face,"
2842,X.,And go with silent tread about the room.
2843,X.,They do not know that I am in a trance.
2844,X.,"I hear each whisper uttered, and the sighs"
2845,X.,That heave the desolate bosom of my Grace.
2846,X.,
2847,XI.,XI.
2848,XI.,
2849,XI.,All is so dark since they have shut my eyes;
2850,XI.,I think it cruel in them to do that--
2851,XI.,Shut out the light of day and every chance
2852,XI.,That I could ever have of seeing Grace.
2853,XI.,"I cannot move a muscle, and I try,"
2854,XI.,And strive to part my lips to say some word;
2855,XI.,But all in vain; the mind has lost control
2856,XI.,Over the body's null machinery.
2857,XI.,
2858,XI.,"I wonder if they yet will bury me,"
2859,XI.,"Thinking me dead? To wake up in the grave,"
2860,XI.,"And hear a wagon rumbling overhead,"
2861,XI.,"Or a chance footstep passing near the spot,"
2862,XI.,And then cry out and never get reply;
2863,XI.,"But hear the footstep vanish far away,"
2864,XI.,"And know the cold mould smothers up all cries,"
2865,XI.,"And is above, beneath, and round me,"
2866,XI.,"Is bitter thought. To lie back then and die,"
2867,XI.,"Suffocating slowly while I tear my hair,"
2868,XI.,Makes me most wild to think of.
2869,XI.,
2870,XII.,XII.
2871,XII.,
2872,XII.,Hark! 'tis night.
2873,XII.,The hour is borne distinctly by the wind.
2874,XII.,"My Grace sits near me; now comes to my side,"
2875,XII.,"And unto Him, whose ear is everywhere,"
2876,XII.,"She, kneeling down, puts up her hands, and prays."
2877,XII.,
2878,XII.,"""O Father of all mercies, still be merciful,"
2879,XII.,And raise me from the gulf of this despair.
2880,XII.,I cannot think nor feel my love is dead.
2881,XII.,"If he yet lives, and lingers in a trance,"
2882,XII.,"Give me some sign that I may know the truth."""
2883,XII.,
2884,XII.,"I slowly raise my hand, and let it fall."
2885,XII.,
2886,XII.,"Grace springs up all delight, and draws the cloth,"
2887,XII.,"Kissing my lips, and begging me to wake."
2888,XII.,"I try, but fail to raise my hand again."
2889,XII.,The trance still lasts. My eyes will not unclose;
2890,XII.,My lips refuse the functions of their place.
2891,XII.,
2892,XIII.,XIII.
2893,XIII.,
2894,XIII.,On the next day will be the funeral;
2895,XIII.,But Grace has this delayed for one week more;
2896,XIII.,"Yet all in vain, I neither wake nor move."
2897,XIII.,
2898,XIII.,"I hear the people coming in the house,"
2899,XIII.,And straight within my coffin long to rise.
2900,XIII.,"I hear the pastor's prayer, and then his words,"
2901,XIII.,"Simple and good, and full of tender praise."
2902,XIII.,"They come at last to take a parting look,"
2903,XIII.,A file of faces that pass out the door.
2904,XIII.,I hear them quickly screwing down the lid;
2905,XIII.,"And now the bearers take me from the house,"
2906,XIII.,"And push me, feet first, in the black plumed hearse."
2907,XIII.,"Gianni is a bearer of my pall,"
2908,XIII.,"And Grace is choked with sobs, and follows on."
2909,XIII.,We reach the grave. They slowly lower me down.
2910,XIII.,"Some gravel on the side is loose, and falls"
2911,XIII.,Battling upon the narrow coffin lid.
2912,XIII.,
2913,XIII.,Horror on horror! Let me see no more!
2914,XIII.,
2915,AFTER BURIAL.,AFTER BURIAL.
2916,AFTER BURIAL.,
2917,AFTER BURIAL.,So stands the premonition; and to-day
2918,AFTER BURIAL.,"I look back on the words here written down,"
2919,AFTER BURIAL.,"Comparing them with what has happened since,"
2920,AFTER BURIAL.,And find there is no flaw in any scene.
2921,AFTER BURIAL.,
2922,AFTER BURIAL.,Always intending to tell Grace my fear
2923,AFTER BURIAL.,"That some day I might be entombed alive,"
2924,AFTER BURIAL.,"I always failed, until it was too late."
2925,AFTER BURIAL.,"But as the sod fell on the coffin-lid,"
2926,AFTER BURIAL.,"My trance was broken, and I called and screamed,"
2927,AFTER BURIAL.,"Until they drew me up from out the grave,"
2928,AFTER BURIAL.,"And breaking in my prison, set me free."
2929,AFTER BURIAL.,
2930,AFTER BURIAL.,"Gianni fled, fearing my face at last."
2931,AFTER BURIAL.,"To-day I have his letter from his home,"
2932,AFTER BURIAL.,"Beneath the far-off skies of Italy,"
2933,AFTER BURIAL.,Craving forgiveness for his wrongs to me;
2934,AFTER BURIAL.,"Saying that he repents for all his past,"
2935,AFTER BURIAL.,"And with Christ's help, will lead a better life."
2936,AFTER BURIAL.,He found his wife and children overjoyed
2937,AFTER BURIAL.,To have him back again to their embrace.
2938,AFTER BURIAL.,
2939,AFTER BURIAL.,To-morrow Grace Bernard and I shall wed.
2940,AFTER BURIAL.,"The bell that tolled my bitter funeral knell,"
2941,AFTER BURIAL.,"Will ring, glad of my wedding and my bride--"
2942,AFTER BURIAL.,Ring merrily round and round a jubilant peal.
2943,AFTER BURIAL.,
2944,AFTER BURIAL.,There comes no premonition now to show to me
2945,AFTER BURIAL.,What the long future has in store for us;
2946,AFTER BURIAL.,"But from my door I watch the sunset skies,"
2947,AFTER BURIAL.,"And see blue mountains tower o'er golden plains,"
2948,AFTER BURIAL.,Clothed with pure beauty stretching far away.

2960,THE KING'S SEAL.,"I did not tell the king, because I feared"

2962,THE KING'S SEAL.,"Beside his couch I knelt, and bowed my head--"

2964,THE KING'S SEAL.,"His hot, weak hand he laid upon my hair,"
2965,THE KING'S SEAL.,"And blessed me with his blessing, then said on:"

2976,THE KING'S SEAL.,"So he bent down with pain, and kissed my cheek,"

2983,THE KING'S SEAL.,"With careless garb, and heavy hairy brows"
2984,THE KING'S SEAL.,Bridged over eyes that shone like furnace fire.
2985,THE KING'S SEAL.,My will was lost in his. I grew like him.
2986,THE KING'S SEAL.,I only cared to study and to dream.
2987,THE KING'S SEAL.,"And he it was who, standing in the night"
2988,THE KING'S SEAL.,"Between two pillars on the palace porch,"

3004,THE NIGHT OF THE ESCAPE.,"Long dark brown hair fell from his noble brow,"
3005,THE NIGHT OF THE ESCAPE.,And on the silken billow of the couch lay curled
3006,THE NIGHT OF THE ESCAPE.,Like spray. The other face was cold and dark
