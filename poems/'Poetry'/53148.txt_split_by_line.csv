249,A YOUNG HERO.,"And swamps of slime and melted snow,"
250,A YOUNG HERO.,"And torrents filled to overflow,"

256,A YOUNG HERO.,In chilly stupor dropped to rest.
257,A YOUNG HERO.,
258,A YOUNG HERO.,A sailor lad of years fourteen
259,A YOUNG HERO.,"Had chanced, as by the waters thrown,"

262,A YOUNG HERO.,"The wreck and shore, or haply missed."
263,A YOUNG HERO.,"Cheerly and kind their cheeks he kissed,"
264,A YOUNG HERO.,And folded each in other’s arm.
265,A YOUNG HERO.,Upon a sloping mound of moss
266,A YOUNG HERO.,"He dragged a heavy sail across,"
267,A YOUNG HERO.,"Close-pinned with bowlders, rough yet warm;"
268,A YOUNG HERO.,"And packing it with mosses tight,"
269,A YOUNG HERO.,"Kept steadfast watch the livelong night,"
270,A YOUNG HERO.,"Nor dared depart, lest e’er again"
271,A YOUNG HERO.,"Was found this treasure he had hid,"
272,A YOUNG HERO.,Some sudden treacherous gust had slid
273,A YOUNG HERO.,Beneath that rugged counterpane.
274,A YOUNG HERO.,He knew not name or face of one.
275,A YOUNG HERO.,He saved them. It was nobly done.
276,A YOUNG HERO.,
277,A YOUNG HERO.,Day dawned at last. The storm had lulled;
278,A YOUNG HERO.,"And these were happy, sleeping yet."
279,A YOUNG HERO.,"A few fresh hands of moss he pulled,"
280,A YOUNG HERO.,Then traced with trembling steps the track
281,A YOUNG HERO.,Of many footprints deeply set;
282,A YOUNG HERO.,"And pressing forward, early met"
283,A YOUNG HERO.,"These children’s parents hasting back,"
284,A YOUNG HERO.,"And filled their hearts with boundless joy,"
285,A YOUNG HERO.,As with blanched lips and chattering teeth
286,A YOUNG HERO.,He told them of his night’s employ;
287,A YOUNG HERO.,"Feigned, too, he was not much distressed,"
288,A YOUNG HERO.,"Although his dying heart, beneath"

293,A YOUNG HERO.,Beat faint. They went; and o’er his eyes
294,A YOUNG HERO.,A gathering film beclouded light;
295,A YOUNG HERO.,"And music murmured in his brain,"
296,A YOUNG HERO.,Such respite sang from toil and strain
297,A YOUNG HERO.,"That all his senses, wearied quite,"
298,A YOUNG HERO.,"Were lapped to slumber, lulling pain;"
299,A YOUNG HERO.,"Whilst soothing visions seemed to rise,"
300,A YOUNG HERO.,"That brought him scenes of other times,"

309,A YOUNG HERO.,And they with winning beckonings--
310,A YOUNG HERO.,Who looked so sweet and saintly wise--
311,A YOUNG HERO.,His buoyant spirit drew afar
312,A YOUNG HERO.,"From creaking timbers, shivering sails,"
313,A YOUNG HERO.,"And ships that strain in autumn gales,"
314,A YOUNG HERO.,"And snow-mixed rains, and sleeting hails,"
315,A YOUNG HERO.,And wind and waves at endless war.

355,BUNKER HILL.,We looked into their eyes. “Ready!”
356,BUNKER HILL.,"A sheet of flame, a roll of death!"
357,BUNKER HILL.,They fell by scores: we held our breath.
358,BUNKER HILL.,Then nearer still they came.
359,BUNKER HILL.,"Another sheet of flame,"
360,BUNKER HILL.,And brave men fled who never fled before.
361,BUNKER HILL.,Immortal fight!
362,BUNKER HILL.,Foreshadowing flight
363,BUNKER HILL.,Back to the astounded shore.
364,BUNKER HILL.,

370,BUNKER HILL.,Through their broad bosoms calmly coursed
371,BUNKER HILL.,"The blood of those stout farmers, aiming"

373,BUNKER HILL.,Onward once more they came.
374,BUNKER HILL.,Another sheet of deathful flame!
375,BUNKER HILL.,Another and another still!
376,BUNKER HILL.,"They broke, they fled,"
377,BUNKER HILL.,Again they sped
378,BUNKER HILL.,"Down the green, bloody hill."

389,BUNKER HILL.,"The foe pressed in, nor quailed"
390,BUNKER HILL.,"A man. Their barrels empty, with musket-stocks"
391,BUNKER HILL.,"They fought, and gave death-dealing knocks,"
392,BUNKER HILL.,Till Prescott ordered the retreat.

394,BUNKER HILL.,"From Bunker Hill and Breed,"
395,BUNKER HILL.,"Stark, Putnam, Pomeroy, Knowlton, Read,"

457,HERVÉ RIEL.,
458,HERVÉ RIEL.,"On the sea and at the Hogue, sixteen hundred ninety-two,"
459,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Did the English fight the French,--woe to France!"
460,HERVÉ RIEL.,"And the thirty-first of May, helter-skelter through the blue,"
461,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Like a crowd of frightened porpoises a shoal of sharks pursue,"
462,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Came crowding ship on ship to St. Malo on the Rance,"
463,HERVÉ RIEL.,With the English fleet in view.
464,HERVÉ RIEL.,"’Twas the squadron that escaped, with the victor in full chase,"
465,HERVÉ RIEL.,"First and foremost of the drove, in his great ship, Damfreville."
466,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Close on him fled, great and small,"
467,HERVÉ RIEL.,Twenty-two good ships in all;
468,HERVÉ RIEL.,"And they signalled to the place,"
469,HERVÉ RIEL.,“Help the winners of a race!
470,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Get us guidance, give us harbor, take us quick,--or, quicker still,"
471,HERVÉ RIEL.,Here’s the English can and will!”
472,HERVÉ RIEL.,
473,HERVÉ RIEL.,Then the pilots of the place put out brisk and leaped on board.
474,HERVÉ RIEL.,"“Why, what hope or chance have ships like these to pass?”"
475,HERVÉ RIEL.,laughed they.
476,HERVÉ RIEL.,"“Rocks to starboard, rocks to port, all the passage scarred"
477,HERVÉ RIEL.,"and scored,"
478,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Shall the Formidable here, with her twelve and eighty guns,"
479,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Think to make the river-mouth by the single narrow way,"
480,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Trust to enter where ’tis ticklish for a craft of twenty tons,"
481,HERVÉ RIEL.,And with flow at full beside?
482,HERVÉ RIEL.,Now ’tis slackest ebb of tide.
483,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Reach the mooring? Rather say,"
484,HERVÉ RIEL.,"While rock stands or water runs,"
485,HERVÉ RIEL.,Not a ship will leave the bay!”
486,HERVÉ RIEL.,
487,HERVÉ RIEL.,Then was called a council straight;
488,HERVÉ RIEL.,Brief and bitter the debate:
489,HERVÉ RIEL.,“Here’s the English at our heels; would you have them take in tow
490,HERVÉ RIEL.,"All that’s left us of the fleet, linked together stern and bow,"
491,HERVÉ RIEL.,For a prize to Plymouth Sound?
492,HERVÉ RIEL.,Better run the ships aground!”
493,HERVÉ RIEL.,(Ended Damfreville his speech.)
494,HERVÉ RIEL.,“Not a minute more to wait!
495,HERVÉ RIEL.,Let the captains all and each
496,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Shove ashore, then blow up, burn the vessels on the beach!"
497,HERVÉ RIEL.,France must undergo her fate.”
498,HERVÉ RIEL.,
499,HERVÉ RIEL.,“Give the word!” But no such word
500,HERVÉ RIEL.,Was ever spoke or heard;
501,HERVÉ RIEL.,"For up stood, for out stepped, for in struck amid all these,"
502,HERVÉ RIEL.,"A captain? A lieutenant? A mate,--first, second, third?"
503,HERVÉ RIEL.,"No such man of mark, and meet"
504,HERVÉ RIEL.,"With his betters to compete,"
505,HERVÉ RIEL.,"But a simple Breton sailor, pressed by Tourville for the fleet,--"
506,HERVÉ RIEL.,"A poor coasting-pilot he, Hervé Riel, the Croisickese."
507,HERVÉ RIEL.,
508,HERVÉ RIEL.,[Illustration]
509,HERVÉ RIEL.,
510,HERVÉ RIEL.,And “What mockery or malice have we here?” cries Hervé Riel.
511,HERVÉ RIEL.,"“Are you mad, you Malouins? Are you cowards, fools, or rogues?"
512,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Talk to me of rocks and shoals, me who took the soundings, tell"
513,HERVÉ RIEL.,"On my fingers every bank, every shallow, every swell"
514,HERVÉ RIEL.,"’Twixt the offing here and Greve, where the river disembogues?"
515,HERVÉ RIEL.,Are you bought by English gold? Is it love the lying’s for?
516,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Morn and eve, night and day,"
517,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Have I piloted your bay,"
518,HERVÉ RIEL.,Entered free and anchored fast at the foot of Solidor.
519,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Burn the fleet, and ruin France? That were worse than"
520,HERVÉ RIEL.,fifty Hogues!
521,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Sirs, they know I speak the truth! Sirs, believe me, there’s a way!"
522,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Only let me lead the line,"
523,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Have the biggest ship to steer,"
524,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Get this Formidable clear,"
525,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Make the others follow mine,"
526,HERVÉ RIEL.,"And I lead them most and least by a passage I know well,"
527,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Right to Solidor, past Greve,"
528,HERVÉ RIEL.,And there lay them safe and sound;
529,HERVÉ RIEL.,"And if one ship misbehave,"
530,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Keel so much as grate the ground,--"
531,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Why, I’ve nothing but my life; here’s my head!” cries Hervé Riel."
532,HERVÉ RIEL.,
533,HERVÉ RIEL.,Not a minute more to wait.
534,HERVÉ RIEL.,"“Steer us in, then, small and great!"
535,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Take the helm, lead the line, save the squadron!” cried its chief."
536,HERVÉ RIEL.,"“Captains, give the sailor place!”"
537,HERVÉ RIEL.,"He is admiral, in brief."
538,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Still the north-wind, by God’s grace."
539,HERVÉ RIEL.,See the noble fellow’s face
540,HERVÉ RIEL.,"As the big ship, with a bound,"
541,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Clears the entry like a hound,"
542,HERVÉ RIEL.,Keeps the passage as its inch of way were the wide seas profound!
543,HERVÉ RIEL.,"See, safe through shoal and rock,"
544,HERVÉ RIEL.,How they follow in a flock.
545,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Not a ship that misbehaves, not a keel that grates the ground,"
546,HERVÉ RIEL.,Not a spar that comes to grief!
547,HERVÉ RIEL.,"The peril, see, is past,"
548,HERVÉ RIEL.,All are harbored to the last;
549,HERVÉ RIEL.,"And just as Hervé Riel halloos, “Anchor!”--sure as fate,"
550,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Up the English come, too late."
551,HERVÉ RIEL.,
552,HERVÉ RIEL.,So the storm subsides to calm;
553,HERVÉ RIEL.,They see the green trees wave
554,HERVÉ RIEL.,On the heights o’erlooking Greve.
555,HERVÉ RIEL.,Hearts that bled are stanched with balm.
556,HERVÉ RIEL.,"“Just our rapture to enhance,"
557,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Let the English rake the bay,"
558,HERVÉ RIEL.,Gnash their teeth and glare askance
559,HERVÉ RIEL.,As they cannonade away!
560,HERVÉ RIEL.,’Neath rampired Solidor pleasant riding on the Rance!”
561,HERVÉ RIEL.,How hope succeeds despair on each captain’s countenance!
562,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Out burst all with one accord,"
563,HERVÉ RIEL.,“This is Paradise for Hell!
564,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Let France, let France’s king,"
565,HERVÉ RIEL.,Thank the man that did the thing!”
566,HERVÉ RIEL.,"What a shout, and all one word,"
567,HERVÉ RIEL.,“Hervé Riel!”
568,HERVÉ RIEL.,"As he stepped in front once more,"
569,HERVÉ RIEL.,Not a symptom of surprise
570,HERVÉ RIEL.,"In the frank blue Breton eyes,"
571,HERVÉ RIEL.,Just the same man as before.
572,HERVÉ RIEL.,
573,HERVÉ RIEL.,[Illustration]
574,HERVÉ RIEL.,
575,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Then said Damfreville, “My friend,"
576,HERVÉ RIEL.,"I must speak out at the end,"
577,HERVÉ RIEL.,Though I find the speaking hard:
578,HERVÉ RIEL.,Praise is deeper than the lips.
579,HERVÉ RIEL.,"You have saved the king his ships,"
580,HERVÉ RIEL.,You must name your own reward.
581,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Faith, our sun was near eclipse!"
582,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Demand whate’er you will,"
583,HERVÉ RIEL.,France remains your debtor still.
584,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Ask to heart’s content, and have, or my name’s not Damfreville.”"
585,HERVÉ RIEL.,Then a beam of fun outbroke
586,HERVÉ RIEL.,"On the bearded mouth that spoke,"
587,HERVÉ RIEL.,As the honest heart laughed through
588,HERVÉ RIEL.,Those frank eyes of Breton blue:
589,HERVÉ RIEL.,"“Since I needs must say my say,"
590,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Since on board the duty’s done,"
591,HERVÉ RIEL.,"And from Malo Roads to Croisic Point, what is it but a run?"
592,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Since ’tis ask and have I may,"
593,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Since the others go ashore,--"
594,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Come, a good whole holiday!"
595,HERVÉ RIEL.,"Leave to go and see my wife, whom I call the Belle Aurore!”"
596,HERVÉ RIEL.,"That he asked, and that he got,--nothing more."
597,HERVÉ RIEL.,
598,HERVÉ RIEL.,Name and deed alike are lost;
599,HERVÉ RIEL.,Not a pillar nor a post
600,HERVÉ RIEL.,In his Croisic keeps alive the feat as it befell;
601,HERVÉ RIEL.,Not a head in white and black
602,HERVÉ RIEL.,On a single fishing-smack
603,HERVÉ RIEL.,In memory of the man but for whom had gone to rack
604,HERVÉ RIEL.,All that France saved from the fight whence England bore the bell.
605,HERVÉ RIEL.,Go to Paris; rank on rank
606,HERVÉ RIEL.,Search the heroes flung pell-mell
607,HERVÉ RIEL.,"On the Louvre, face and flank,"
608,HERVÉ RIEL.,You shall look long enough ere you come to Hervé Riel.
609,HERVÉ RIEL.,"So, for better and for worse,"

2145,JOHN MAYNARD.,"His nerveless hands released their task,"
2146,JOHN MAYNARD.,He sank beside the wheel.
2147,JOHN MAYNARD.,"The wave received his lifeless corpse,"

2156,EXCALIBUR.,“The sequel of to-day unsolders all
2157,EXCALIBUR.,The goodliest fellowship of famous knights
2158,EXCALIBUR.,Whereof this world holds record. Such a sleep
2159,EXCALIBUR.,"They sleep,--the men I loved. I think that we"
2160,EXCALIBUR.,"Shall never more, at any future time,"
2161,EXCALIBUR.,"Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds,"
2162,EXCALIBUR.,Walking about the gardens and the halls
2163,EXCALIBUR.,"Of Camelot, as in the days that were."
2164,EXCALIBUR.,"I perish by this people which I made,--"
2165,EXCALIBUR.,Though Merlin swear that I should come again
2166,EXCALIBUR.,"To rule once more; but let what will be, be:"
2167,EXCALIBUR.,I am so deeply smitten through the helm
2168,EXCALIBUR.,That without help I cannot last till morn.
2169,EXCALIBUR.,"Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur,"
2170,EXCALIBUR.,Which was my pride: for thou rememberest how
2171,EXCALIBUR.,"In those old days, one summer noon, an arm"
2172,EXCALIBUR.,"Rose up from out the bosom of the lake,"
2173,EXCALIBUR.,"Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,"
2174,EXCALIBUR.,Holding the sword; and how I rowed across
2175,EXCALIBUR.,"And took it, and have worn it, like a king:"
2176,EXCALIBUR.,"And, wheresoever I am sung or told"
2177,EXCALIBUR.,"In after-time, this also shall be known:"
2178,EXCALIBUR.,"But now delay not: take Excalibur,"
2179,EXCALIBUR.,And fling him far into the middle mere.
2180,EXCALIBUR.,"Watch what thou seest, and lightly bring me word.”"
2181,EXCALIBUR.,
2182,EXCALIBUR.,[Illustration]
2183,EXCALIBUR.,
2184,EXCALIBUR.,"Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran,"
2185,EXCALIBUR.,"And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged"
2186,EXCALIBUR.,"Among the bulrush beds, and clutched the sword,"
2187,EXCALIBUR.,And strongly wheeled and threw it. The great brand
2188,EXCALIBUR.,"Made lightnings in the splendor of the moon,"
2189,EXCALIBUR.,"And flashing round and round, and whirled in an arch,"
2190,EXCALIBUR.,"Shot like a streamer of the northern morn,"
2191,EXCALIBUR.,Seen where the moving isles of winter shock
2192,EXCALIBUR.,"By night, with noises of the northern sea."
2193,EXCALIBUR.,So flashed and fell the brand Excalibur:
2194,EXCALIBUR.,"But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm"
2195,EXCALIBUR.,"Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,"
2196,EXCALIBUR.,"And caught him by the hilt, and brandished him"
2197,EXCALIBUR.,"Three times, and drew him under in the mere."

2208,THE DEATH OF ARTHUR.,That all the decks were dense with stately forms
2209,THE DEATH OF ARTHUR.,"Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream; by these"
2210,THE DEATH OF ARTHUR.,"Three Queens with crowns of gold, and from them rose"
2211,THE DEATH OF ARTHUR.,"A cry that shivered to the tingling stars,"
2212,THE DEATH OF ARTHUR.,"And, as it were one voice, an agony"

2216,THE DEATH OF ARTHUR.,
2217,THE DEATH OF ARTHUR.,"Then murmured Arthur, “Place me in the barge.”"

2226,THE DEATH OF ARTHUR.,Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.

2228,THE DEATH OF ARTHUR.,"I have lived my life, and that which I have done"
2229,THE DEATH OF ARTHUR.,"May He within himself make pure! but thou,"
2230,THE DEATH OF ARTHUR.,"If thou shouldst never see my face again,"
2231,THE DEATH OF ARTHUR.,Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer
2232,THE DEATH OF ARTHUR.,"Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voice"
2233,THE DEATH OF ARTHUR.,Rise like a fountain for me night and day.
2234,THE DEATH OF ARTHUR.,For what are men better than sheep or goats
2235,THE DEATH OF ARTHUR.,"That nourish a blind life within the brain,"
2236,THE DEATH OF ARTHUR.,"If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer"
2237,THE DEATH OF ARTHUR.,Both for themselves and those who call them friend?
2238,THE DEATH OF ARTHUR.,For so the whole round earth is every way
2239,THE DEATH OF ARTHUR.,Bound by gold chains about the feet of God.
2240,THE DEATH OF ARTHUR.,But now farewell. I am going a long way
2241,THE DEATH OF ARTHUR.,With these thou seest--if indeed I go--
2242,THE DEATH OF ARTHUR.,(For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)
2243,THE DEATH OF ARTHUR.,"To the island-valley of Avilion,"

2488,A YARN.,Rose up and strove with the hurricane.
2489,A YARN.,
2490,A YARN.,"“Up spake the mate, and his tone was gay,--"
2491,A YARN.,‘Shall we at this hour to fear give way?
2492,A YARN.,"We must labor, in sooth, as well as pray."
2493,A YARN.,"Out, shipmates, and grapple home yonder sail,"
2494,A YARN.,That flutters in ribbons before the gale!’
2495,A YARN.,
2496,A YARN.,"“Loud swelled the tempest, and rose the shriek,"
2497,A YARN.,"‘Save, save! we are sinking! A leak! a leak!’"
2498,A YARN.,And the hale old skipper’s tawny cheek
2499,A YARN.,"Was cold, as ’twere sculptured in marble there,"
2500,A YARN.,And white as the foam or his own white hair.
2501,A YARN.,
2502,A YARN.,[Illustration]
2503,A YARN.,
2504,A YARN.,"“The wind piped shrilly, the wind piped loud,"
2505,A YARN.,"It shrieked ’mong the cordage, it howled in the shroud,"
2506,A YARN.,"And the sleet fell thick from the cold, dun cloud;"
2507,A YARN.,"But high over all, in tones of glee,"
2508,A YARN.,"The voice of the mate rang cheerily,--"
2509,A YARN.,
2510,A YARN.,"“Now, men, for your wives’ and your sweethearts’ sakes!"
2511,A YARN.,"Cheer, messmates, cheer! Quick! man the brakes!"
2512,A YARN.,We’ll gain on the leak ere the skipper wakes;
2513,A YARN.,"And though our peril your hearts appall,"
2514,A YARN.,Ere dawns the morrow we’ll laugh at the squall.”
2515,A YARN.,
2516,A YARN.,"“He railed at the tempest, he laughed at its threats,"
2517,A YARN.,He played with his fingers like castanets;
2518,A YARN.,"Yet think not that he, in his mirth, forgets"
2519,A YARN.,That the plank he is riding this hour at sea
2520,A YARN.,May launch him the next to eternity!
2521,A YARN.,
2522,A YARN.,"“The white-haired skipper turned away,"
2523,A YARN.,"And lifted his hands, as it were to pray;"
2524,A YARN.,"But his look spoke plainly as look could say,"
2525,A YARN.,"The boastful thought of the Pharisee,--"
2526,A YARN.,"‘Thank God, I’m not hardened as others be!’"
2527,A YARN.,
2528,A YARN.,"“But the morning dawned, and the waves sank low,"
2529,A YARN.,"And the winds, o’erwearied, forebore to blow:"
2530,A YARN.,And our bark lay there in the golden glow.--
2531,A YARN.,"Flashing she lay in the bright sunshine,"
2532,A YARN.,"_An ice-sheathed hulk_ on the cold, still brine."
2533,A YARN.,
2534,A YARN.,"“Well, shipmates, my yarn is almost spun--"
2535,A YARN.,"The cold and the tempest their work had done,"
2536,A YARN.,"And I was the last, lone, living one,"
2537,A YARN.,"Clinging, benumbed, to that wave-girt wreck,"
2538,A YARN.,While the dead around me bestrewed the deck.
2539,A YARN.,
2540,A YARN.,"“Yea, the dead were round me everywhere!"
2541,A YARN.,"The skipper gray, in the sunlight there,"
2542,A YARN.,Still lifted his paralyzed hands in prayer;
2543,A YARN.,"And the mate, whose tones through the darkness leapt,"
2544,A YARN.,In the silent hush of the morning slept.
2545,A YARN.,
2546,A YARN.,"“Oh, bravely he perished who sought to save"
2547,A YARN.,"Our storm-tossed bark from the pitiless wave,"
2548,A YARN.,"And her crew from a yawning and fathomless grave,"
2549,A YARN.,"Crying, Messmates, cheer!’ with a bright, glad smile,"
2550,A YARN.,"And praying, ‘Be merciful, God!’ the while."
2551,A YARN.,
2552,A YARN.,"“True to his trust, to his last chill gasp,"
2553,A YARN.,"The helm lay clutched in his stiff, cold grasp:"
2554,A YARN.,You might scarcely in death undo the clasp;
2555,A YARN.,"And his crisp, brown locks were dank and thin,"
2556,A YARN.,And the icicles hung from his bearded chin.
2557,A YARN.,
2558,A YARN.,"“My timbers have weathered, since, many a gale;"
2559,A YARN.,"And when life’s tempests this hulk assail,"
2560,A YARN.,"And the binnacle-lamp in my breast burns pale,"
2561,A YARN.,"‘Cheer, messmates, cheer!’ to my heart I say,"
2562,A YARN.,"‘We must labor, in sooth, as well as pray.’”"
