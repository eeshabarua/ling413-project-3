45,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,
46,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,"Dear Friends of our youth, should you happen to look"
47,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,"At the curious things in this curious book,"
48,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,"And should you, with quizzical countenance, ask"
49,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,The how and the why of our curious task--
50,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,We could truly reply
51,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,"To the query of ""why--"""
52,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,"To the smile on your lip, and your questioning eye,"
53,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,That the work was begun
54,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,"In a spirit of fun,"
55,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,To amuse when the work of the daylight was done;
56,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,"And continued, because we believed it would be"
57,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,Amusement to such as were weary as we
58,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,"To drift for awhile among goblins and elves,"
59,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,Or haply make shadows and rhymes for themselves.
60,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,"For though years have passed since we drifted apart,"
61,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,We're all of us more or less children at heart.
62,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,And maybe yourselves and the youngsters 't will please
63,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,To dwell for an hour with such creatures as these.

69,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,"Now, some one has said, in a moment of spleen,"
70,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,We cannot make pictures of what we've not seen;
71,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,"But such an assertion deserves only scorn,"
72,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,For the shape of the Gobolink never was born.
73,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,"He comes like the marvelous mimes of our dreams,"
74,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,"When one has been supping on salads and creams,"
75,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,And curious changes of vision take place--
76,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,The horse may appear with an elephant face--
77,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,"The goat with a cane, and the goose with a hat--"
78,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,"Six legs on the dog, and two tails on the cat;"
79,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,"We never can tell, though we're sorely perplexed,"
80,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,"What shape will be shown us, or what will come next;"
81,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,And these are the things that our Gobolinks do--

92,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,[Illustration]
93,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,
94,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,Drop a little ink on a sheet of white paper. Fold the sheet in the
95,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,center and press the ink-spots together with the fingers. All of the
96,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,pictures in this book were made in this manner----none of them having
97,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,been touched with a pen or brush.
98,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,
99,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,"A great deal of practice will only go to show that the Gobolink, as his"
100,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,"name implies, is a veritable goblin of the ink-bottle, and the way he"
101,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,eludes the artist's design proves him a self-made eccentric creature of
102,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,a superior imagination.
103,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,
104,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,It is hardly to be expected that the animals and birds of prey referred
105,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,to under more or less familiar names in the accompanying rhymes will be
106,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,"strikingly correct as to anatomy; and because, as upon page 15, the"
107,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,"elephants, or whatever they may be, happen to have each a row of"
108,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,"interesting tails continuing along the full length of the spinal column,"
109,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,no unkind criticism should be made upon the ability of the overworked
110,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,"and conscientious artists, who would have made fewer tails if they"
111,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,"could, and have added nothing to the price of the book on account of"
112,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,undue liberality in the matter of caudal appendages.

114,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,[Illustration]
115,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,
116,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,In fact the most unexpected and startling results will often
117,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,"occur--results grotesquely and strangely beautiful, well worthy of"
118,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,preservation. The authors of this book will be glad to receive a few
119,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,examples of some of the more unusual Gobolinks or Shadow-Pictures that
120,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,may occur to those interested in the amusement. They may be sent care of

129,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"Persons of all ages may obtain amusement out of Gobolinks, or"
130,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"Shadow-Pictures, as they are also called."
131,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,
132,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,[Illustration]
133,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,
134,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,The following is a very good method for playing the game:
135,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,
136,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,Let three of the company be selected by the hostess as judges. To each
137,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"of the others she then distributes from five to ten sheets of paper,"
138,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,from which they must produce at least one completed picture and rhyme in
139,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"a given length of time, say five minutes, at the end of which the"
140,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,hostess rings a bell and the judges proceed at once to take up the
141,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,pictures. These are then passed upon by them while the hostess is
142,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"distributing a fresh round of paper, and the best two and the worst one"
143,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,are laid aside.
144,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,
145,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"Those whose pictures have been selected now act as judges, surrendering"
146,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"their places at the tables to their predecessors, and another lot of"
147,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,pictures and rhymes are made.
148,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,
149,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,The game is continued in this manner until the hostess announces the
150,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"arrival of the time for final judgment, or until a certain hour"
151,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,specified in the beginning.
152,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,
153,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,[Illustration]
154,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,
155,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,The three judges then in office now select one of the company as
156,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"""reader,"" and such person selected shall take up his position in strong"
157,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"light, and after reading the verses on each picture shall display it in"
158,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,full view of all present. It should then be pinned to a suspended sheet
159,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,or screen where it may be easily examined by the company.
160,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,
161,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,This shall be continued until all the pictures selected by the judges
162,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"have been so treated and displayed. The reader then acts as chairman,"
163,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"and the company proceed to vote on them for first, second, and booby"
164,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,prizes.
165,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,
166,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,The Gobolink receiving second largest number of votes for first prize is
167,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"awarded second. The ballot for booby should be, of course, taken"
168,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,separately. Pictures should be signed or otherwise identified.
169,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,
170,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,[Illustration]
171,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,
172,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"Where a number are making the pictures, it is well to seat them around a"
173,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,large table with the ink-supply in the center.
174,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,
175,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"Jet-black ink should be used, and a good quality of unglazed paper. The"
176,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,ink should not be too thin.
177,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,
178,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,The table should be protected from accident with several thicknesses of
179,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,newspaper.
180,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,
181,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,A filled pen or tincture-dropper may be used for supplying the ink.
182,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,
183,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,For a specially invited Gobolink party the company may dress in any
184,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"grotesque fashion, remembering only that both sides of their costume"
185,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"shall be the same, this being a feature peculiar to Gobolink attire."
186,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,
187,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,No game could be more productive of amusement than Gobolink.
