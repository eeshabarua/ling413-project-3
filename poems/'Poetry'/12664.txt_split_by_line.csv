119,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,
120,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,
121,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,"It fell on a day I was happy,"
122,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,"And the winds, the concave sky,"
123,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,The flowers and the beasts in the meadow
124,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,Seemed happy even as I;
125,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,"And I stretched my hands to the meadow,"
126,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,"To the bird, the beast, the tree:"
127,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,"""Why are ye all so happy?"""
128,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,"I cried, and they answered me."
129,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,
130,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,"What sayest thou, Oh meadow,"
131,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,"That stretches so wide, so far,"
132,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,That none can say how many
133,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,Thy misty marguerites are?
134,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,"And what say ye, red roses,"
135,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,That o'er the sun-blanched wall
136,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,From your high black-shadowed trellis
137,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,Like flame or blood-drops fall?
138,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,"""We are born, we are reared, and we linger"
139,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,A various space and die;
140,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,"We dream, and are bright and happy,"
141,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,"But we cannot answer why."""
142,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,
143,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,"What sayest thou, Oh shadow,"
144,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,That from the dreaming hill
145,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,All down the broadening valley
146,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,Liest so sharp and still?
147,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,"And thou, Oh murmuring brooklet,"
148,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,Whereby in the noonday gleam
149,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,"The loosestrife burns like ruby,"
150,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,And the branch√®d asters dream?
151,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,"""We are born, we are reared, and we linger"
152,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,A various space and die;
153,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,"We dream and are very happy,"
154,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,"But we cannot answer why."""
155,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,
156,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,"And then of myself I questioned,"
157,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,That like a ghost the while
158,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,"Stood from me and calmly answered,"
159,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,With slow and curious smile:
160,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,"""Thou art born as the flowers, and wilt linger"
161,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,Thine own short space and die;
162,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,"Thou dream'st and art strangely happy,"
163,THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE,"But thou canst not answer why."""

169,GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW,
170,GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW,
171,GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW,March is slain; the keen winds fly;
172,GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW,Nothing more is thine to do;
173,GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW,April kisses thee good-bye;
174,GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW,Thou must haste and follow too;
175,GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW,Silent friend that guarded well
176,GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW,"Withered things to make us glad,"
177,GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW,Shyest friend that could not tell
178,GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW,Half the kindly thought he had.
179,GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW,"Haste thee, speed thee, O kind snow;"
180,GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW,"Down the dripping valleys go,"
181,GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW,"From the fields and gleaming meadows,"
182,GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW,"Where the slaying hours behold thee,"
183,GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW,"From the forests whose slim shadows,"
184,GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW,"Brown and leafless cannot fold thee,"
185,GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW,Through the cedar lands aflame
186,GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW,"With gold light that cleaves and quivers,"
187,GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW,"Songs that winter may not tame,"
188,GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW,Drone of pines and laugh of rivers.
189,GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW,May thy passing joyous be
190,GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW,"To thy father, the great sea,"
191,GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW,For the sun is getting stronger;
192,GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW,Earth hath need of thee no longer;
193,GOD-SPEED TO THE SNOW,"Go, kind snow, God-speed to thee!"

199,APRIL IN THE HILLS,
200,APRIL IN THE HILLS,
201,APRIL IN THE HILLS,To-day the world is wide and fair
202,APRIL IN THE HILLS,"With sunny fields of lucid air,"
203,APRIL IN THE HILLS,And waters dancing everywhere;
204,APRIL IN THE HILLS,The snow is almost gone;
205,APRIL IN THE HILLS,"The noon is builded high with light,"
206,APRIL IN THE HILLS,"And over heaven's liquid height,"
207,APRIL IN THE HILLS,"In steady fleets serene and white,"
208,APRIL IN THE HILLS,The happy clouds go on.
209,APRIL IN THE HILLS,
210,APRIL IN THE HILLS,"The channels run, the bare earth steams,"
211,APRIL IN THE HILLS,And every hollow rings and gleams
212,APRIL IN THE HILLS,With jetting falls and dashing streams;
213,APRIL IN THE HILLS,The rivers burst and fill;
214,APRIL IN THE HILLS,"The fields are full of little lakes,"
215,APRIL IN THE HILLS,And when the romping wind awakes
216,APRIL IN THE HILLS,"The water ruffles blue and shakes,"
217,APRIL IN THE HILLS,And the pines roar on the hill.
218,APRIL IN THE HILLS,
219,APRIL IN THE HILLS,"The crows go by, a noisy throng;"
220,APRIL IN THE HILLS,About the meadows all day long
221,APRIL IN THE HILLS,The shore-lark drops his brittle song;
222,APRIL IN THE HILLS,And up the leafless tree
223,APRIL IN THE HILLS,"The nut-hatch runs, and nods, and clings;"
224,APRIL IN THE HILLS,"The bluebird dips with flashing wings,"
225,APRIL IN THE HILLS,"The robin flutes, the sparrow sings,"
226,APRIL IN THE HILLS,And the swallows float and flee.
227,APRIL IN THE HILLS,
228,APRIL IN THE HILLS,"I break the spirit's cloudy bands,"
229,APRIL IN THE HILLS,"A wanderer in enchanted lands,"
230,APRIL IN THE HILLS,I feel the sun upon my hands;
231,APRIL IN THE HILLS,And far from care and strife
232,APRIL IN THE HILLS,The broad earth bids me forth. I rise
233,APRIL IN THE HILLS,With lifted brow and upward eyes.
234,APRIL IN THE HILLS,"I bathe my spirit in blue skies,"
235,APRIL IN THE HILLS,And taste the springs of life.
236,APRIL IN THE HILLS,
237,APRIL IN THE HILLS,I feel the tumult of new birth;
238,APRIL IN THE HILLS,I waken with the wakening earth;
239,APRIL IN THE HILLS,I match the bluebird in her mirth;
240,APRIL IN THE HILLS,"And wild with wind and sun,"
241,APRIL IN THE HILLS,"A treasurer of immortal days,"
242,APRIL IN THE HILLS,"I roam the glorious world with praise,"
243,APRIL IN THE HILLS,"The hillsides and the woodland ways,"
244,APRIL IN THE HILLS,Till earth and I are one.

251,FOREST MOODS,
252,FOREST MOODS,"There is singing of birds in the deep wet woods,"
253,FOREST MOODS,"In the heart of the listening solitudes,"
254,FOREST MOODS,"Pewees, and thrushes, and sparrows, not few,"
255,FOREST MOODS,And all the notes of their throats are true.
256,FOREST MOODS,
257,FOREST MOODS,The thrush from the innermost ash takes on
258,FOREST MOODS,A tender dream of the treasured and gone;
259,FOREST MOODS,But the sparrow singeth with pride and cheer
260,FOREST MOODS,Of the might and light of the present and here.
261,FOREST MOODS,
262,FOREST MOODS,"There is shining of flowers in the deep wet woods,"
263,FOREST MOODS,"In the heart of the sensitive solitudes,"
264,FOREST MOODS,"The roseate bell and the lily are there,"
265,FOREST MOODS,And every leaf of their sheaf is fair.
266,FOREST MOODS,
267,FOREST MOODS,"Careless and bold, without dream of woe,"
268,FOREST MOODS,The trilliums scatter their flags snow;
269,FOREST MOODS,"But the pale wood-daffodil covers her face,"
270,FOREST MOODS,Agloom with the doom of a sorrowful race.

276,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,
277,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,
278,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,"Again the warm bare earth, the noon"
279,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,"That hangs upon her healing scars,"
280,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,"The midnight round, the great red moon,"
281,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,"The mother with her brood of stars,"
282,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,
283,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,The mist-rack and the wakening rain
284,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,"Blown soft in many a forest way,"
285,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,"The yellowing elm-trees, and again"
286,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,The blood-root in its sheath of gray.
287,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,
288,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,"The vesper-sparrow's song, the stress"
289,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,"Of yearning notes that gush and stream,"
290,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,"The lyric joy, the tenderness,"
291,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,And once again the dream! the dream!
292,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,
293,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,"A touch of far-off joy and power,"
294,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,"A something it is life to learn,"
295,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,"Comes back to earth, and one short hour"
296,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,The glamours of the gods return.
297,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,
298,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,This life's old mood and cult of care
299,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,"Falls smitten by an older truth,"
300,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,And the gray world wins back to her
301,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,The rapture of her vanished youth.
302,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,
303,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,"Dead thoughts revive, and he that heeds"
304,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,"Shall hear, as by a spirit led,"
305,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,A song among the golden reeds:
306,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,"""The gods are vanished but not dead!"""
307,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,
308,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,"For one short hour; unseen yet near,"
309,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,"They haunt us, a forgotten mood,"
310,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,"A glory upon mead and mere,"
311,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,A magic in the leafless wood.
312,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,
313,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,At morning we shall catch the glow
314,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,"Of Dian's quiver on the hill,"
315,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,And somewhere in the glades I know
316,THE RETURN OF THE YEAR,That Pan is at his piping still.

323,FAVORITES OF PAN,
324,FAVORITES OF PAN,"Once, long ago, before the gods"
325,FAVORITES OF PAN,"Had left this earth, by stream and forest glade,"
326,FAVORITES OF PAN,"Where the first plough upturned the clinging sods,"
327,FAVORITES OF PAN,"Or the lost shepherd strayed,"
328,FAVORITES OF PAN,
329,FAVORITES OF PAN,Often to the tired listener's ear
330,FAVORITES OF PAN,There came at noonday or beneath the stars
331,FAVORITES OF PAN,"A sound, he knew not whence, so sweet and clear,"
332,FAVORITES OF PAN,That all his aches and scars
333,FAVORITES OF PAN,
334,FAVORITES OF PAN,"And every brooded bitterness,"
335,FAVORITES OF PAN,"Fallen asunder from his soul took flight,"
336,FAVORITES OF PAN,Like mist or darkness yielding to the press
337,FAVORITES OF PAN,"Of an unnamed delight,--"
338,FAVORITES OF PAN,
339,FAVORITES OF PAN,"A sudden brightness of the heart,"
340,FAVORITES OF PAN,"A magic fire drawn down from Paradise,"
341,FAVORITES OF PAN,"That rent the cloud with golden gleam apart,--"
342,FAVORITES OF PAN,And far before his eyes
343,FAVORITES OF PAN,
344,FAVORITES OF PAN,The loveliness and calm of earth
345,FAVORITES OF PAN,"Lay like a limitless dream remote and strange,"
346,FAVORITES OF PAN,"The joy, the strife, the triumph and the mirth,"
347,FAVORITES OF PAN,And the enchanted change;
348,FAVORITES OF PAN,
349,FAVORITES OF PAN,"And so he followed the sweet sound,"
350,FAVORITES OF PAN,"Till faith had traversed her appointed span,"
351,FAVORITES OF PAN,And murmured as he pressed the sacred ground:
352,FAVORITES OF PAN,"""It is the note of Pan!"""
353,FAVORITES OF PAN,
354,FAVORITES OF PAN,Now though no more by marsh or stream
355,FAVORITES OF PAN,Or dewy forest sounds the secret reed--
356,FAVORITES OF PAN,"For Pan is gone--Ah yet, the infinite dream"
357,FAVORITES OF PAN,Still lives for them that heed.
358,FAVORITES OF PAN,
359,FAVORITES OF PAN,"In April, when the turning year"
360,FAVORITES OF PAN,"Regains its pensive youth, and a soft breath"
361,FAVORITES OF PAN,And amorous influence over marsh and mere
362,FAVORITES OF PAN,"Dissolves the grasp of death,"
363,FAVORITES OF PAN,
364,FAVORITES OF PAN,"To them that are in love with life,"
365,FAVORITES OF PAN,"Wandering like children with untroubled eyes,"
366,FAVORITES OF PAN,"Far from the noise of cities and the strife,"
367,FAVORITES OF PAN,Strange flute-like voices rise
368,FAVORITES OF PAN,
369,FAVORITES OF PAN,At noon and in the quiet of the night
370,FAVORITES OF PAN,From every watery waste; and in that hour
371,FAVORITES OF PAN,"The same strange spell, the same unnamed delight,"
372,FAVORITES OF PAN,Enfolds them in its power.
373,FAVORITES OF PAN,
374,FAVORITES OF PAN,"An old-world joyousness supreme,"
375,FAVORITES OF PAN,"The warmth and glow of an immortal balm,"
376,FAVORITES OF PAN,"The mood-touch of the gods, the endless dream,"
377,FAVORITES OF PAN,The high lethean calm.
378,FAVORITES OF PAN,
379,FAVORITES OF PAN,"They see, wide on the eternal way,"
380,FAVORITES OF PAN,"The services of earth, the life of man;"
381,FAVORITES OF PAN,"And, listening to the magic cry they say:"
382,FAVORITES OF PAN,"""It is the note of Pan!"""
383,FAVORITES OF PAN,
384,FAVORITES OF PAN,"For, long ago, when the new strains"
385,FAVORITES OF PAN,"Of hostile hymns and conquering faiths grew keen,"
386,FAVORITES OF PAN,"And the old gods from their deserted fanes,"
387,FAVORITES OF PAN,"Fled silent and unseen,"
388,FAVORITES OF PAN,
389,FAVORITES OF PAN,"So, too, the goat-foot Pan, not less"
390,FAVORITES OF PAN,"Sadly obedient to the mightier hand,"
391,FAVORITES OF PAN,"Cut him new reeds, and in a sore distress"
392,FAVORITES OF PAN,Passed out from land to land;
393,FAVORITES OF PAN,
394,FAVORITES OF PAN,"And lingering by each haunt he knew,"
395,FAVORITES OF PAN,"Of fount or sinuous stream or grassy marge,"
396,FAVORITES OF PAN,"He set the syrinx to his lips, and blew"
397,FAVORITES OF PAN,A note divinely large;
398,FAVORITES OF PAN,
399,FAVORITES OF PAN,And all around him on the wet
400,FAVORITES OF PAN,"Cool earth the frogs came up, and with a smile"
401,FAVORITES OF PAN,"He took them in his hairy hands, and set"
402,FAVORITES OF PAN,"His mouth to theirs awhile,"
403,FAVORITES OF PAN,
404,FAVORITES OF PAN,And blew into their velvet throats;
405,FAVORITES OF PAN,And ever from that hour the frogs repeat
406,FAVORITES OF PAN,"The murmur of Pan's pipes, the notes,"
407,FAVORITES OF PAN,And answers strange and sweet;
408,FAVORITES OF PAN,
409,FAVORITES OF PAN,And they that hear them are renewed
410,FAVORITES OF PAN,"By knowledge in some god-like touch conveyed,"
411,FAVORITES OF PAN,"Entering again into the eternal mood,"
412,FAVORITES OF PAN,Wherein the world was made.

417,THE MEADOW,THE MEADOW
418,THE MEADOW,
419,THE MEADOW,
420,THE MEADOW,"Here when the cloudless April days begin,"
421,THE MEADOW,"And the quaint crows flock thicker day by day,"
422,THE MEADOW,"Filling the forests with a pleasant din,"
423,THE MEADOW,"And the soiled snow creeps secretly away,"
424,THE MEADOW,"Comes the small busy sparrow, primed with glee,"
425,THE MEADOW,"First preacher in the naked wilderness,"
426,THE MEADOW,Piping an end to all the long distress
427,THE MEADOW,From every fence and every leafless tree.
428,THE MEADOW,
429,THE MEADOW,Now with soft slight and viewless artifice
430,THE MEADOW,Winter's iron work is wondrously undone;
431,THE MEADOW,In all the little hollows cored with ice
432,THE MEADOW,"The clear brown pools stand simmering in the sun,"
433,THE MEADOW,"Frail lucid worlds, upon whose tremulous floors"
434,THE MEADOW,"All day the wandering water-bugs at will,"
435,THE MEADOW,"Shy mariners whose oars are never still,"
436,THE MEADOW,Voyage and dream about the heightening shores.
437,THE MEADOW,
438,THE MEADOW,"The bluebird, peeping from the gnarl√®d thorn,"
439,THE MEADOW,"Prattles upon his frolic flute, or flings,"
440,THE MEADOW,"In bounding flight across the golden morn,"
441,THE MEADOW,An azure gleam from off his splendid wings.
442,THE MEADOW,Here the slim-pinioned swallows sweep and pass
443,THE MEADOW,Down to the far-off river; the black crow
444,THE MEADOW,With wise and wary visage to and fro
445,THE MEADOW,Settles and stalks about the withered grass.
446,THE MEADOW,
447,THE MEADOW,"Here, when the murmurous May-day is half gone,"
448,THE MEADOW,"The watchful lark before my feet takes flight,"
449,THE MEADOW,"And wheeling to some lonelier field far on,"
450,THE MEADOW,"Drops with obstreperous cry; and here at night,"
451,THE MEADOW,"When the first star precedes the great red moon,"
452,THE MEADOW,"The shore-lark tinkles from the darkening field,"
453,THE MEADOW,"Somewhere, we know not, in the dusk concealed,"
454,THE MEADOW,His little creakling and continuous tune.
455,THE MEADOW,
456,THE MEADOW,"Here, too, the robins, lusty as of old,"
457,THE MEADOW,"Hunt the waste grass for forage, or prolong"
458,THE MEADOW,"From every quarter of these fields the bold,"
459,THE MEADOW,Blithe phrases of their never-finished song.
460,THE MEADOW,The white-throat's distant descant with slow stress
461,THE MEADOW,"Note after note upon the noonday falls,"
462,THE MEADOW,Filling the leisured air at intervals
463,THE MEADOW,With his own mood of piercing pensiveness.
464,THE MEADOW,
465,THE MEADOW,"How often from this windy upland perch,"
466,THE MEADOW,"Mine eyes have seen the forest break in bloom,"
467,THE MEADOW,"The rose-red maple and the golden birch,"
468,THE MEADOW,"The dusty yellow of the elms, the gloom"
469,THE MEADOW,Of the tall poplar hung with tasseled black;
470,THE MEADOW,"Ah, I have watched, till eye and ear and brain"
471,THE MEADOW,"Grew full of dreams as they, the moted plain,"
472,THE MEADOW,"The sun-steeped wood, the marsh-land at its back,"
473,THE MEADOW,
474,THE MEADOW,"The valley where the river wheels and fills,"
475,THE MEADOW,"Yon city glimmering in its smoky shroud,"
476,THE MEADOW,And out at the last misty rim the hills
477,THE MEADOW,"Blue and far off and mounded like a cloud,"
478,THE MEADOW,And here the noisy rutted road that goes
479,THE MEADOW,"Down the slope yonder, flanked on either side"
480,THE MEADOW,"With the smooth-furrowed fields flung black and wide,"
481,THE MEADOW,Patched with pale water sleeping in the rows.
482,THE MEADOW,
483,THE MEADOW,"So as I watched the crowded leaves expand,"
484,THE MEADOW,"The bloom break sheath, the summer's strength uprear,"
485,THE MEADOW,In earth's great mother's heart already planned
486,THE MEADOW,"The heaped and burgeoned plenty of the year,"
487,THE MEADOW,Even as she from out her wintry cell
488,THE MEADOW,"My spirit also sprang to life anew,"
489,THE MEADOW,"And day by day as the spring's bounty grew,"
490,THE MEADOW,Its conquering joy possessed me like a spell.
491,THE MEADOW,
492,THE MEADOW,In reverie by day and midnight dream
493,THE MEADOW,"I sought these upland fields and walked apart,"
494,THE MEADOW,"Musing on Nature, till my thought did seem"
495,THE MEADOW,To read the very secrets of her heart;
496,THE MEADOW,In mooded moments earnest and sublime
497,THE MEADOW,"I stored the themes of many a future song,"
498,THE MEADOW,"Whose substance should be Nature's, clear and strong,"
499,THE MEADOW,Bound in a casket of majestic rhyme.
500,THE MEADOW,
501,THE MEADOW,"Brave bud-like plans that never reached the fruit,"
502,THE MEADOW,"Like hers our mother's who with every hour,"
503,THE MEADOW,"Easily replenished from the sleepless root,"
504,THE MEADOW,Covers her bosom with fresh bud and flower;
505,THE MEADOW,"Yet I was happy as young lovers be,"
506,THE MEADOW,Who in the season of their passion's birth
507,THE MEADOW,"Deem that they have their utmost worship's worth,"
508,THE MEADOW,"If love be near them, just to hear and see."

516,IN MAY,Grief was my master yesternight;

528,IN MAY,"The glory of the perfect green,"

530,IN MAY,
531,IN MAY,The bobolinks at noonday sing
532,IN MAY,"More softly than the softest flute,"

534,IN MAY,Their fairy tambours ring.
535,IN MAY,
536,IN MAY,The roads far off are towered with dust;
537,IN MAY,The cherry-blooms are swept and thinned;
538,IN MAY,In yonder swaying elms the wind
539,IN MAY,Is charging gust on gust.
540,IN MAY,
541,IN MAY,But here there is no stir at all;
542,IN MAY,The ministers of sun and shadow
543,IN MAY,Horde all the perfumes of the meadow
544,IN MAY,Behind a grassy wall.
545,IN MAY,
546,IN MAY,An infant rivulet wind-free
547,IN MAY,"Adown the guarded hollow sets,"
548,IN MAY,Over whose brink the violets
549,IN MAY,Are nodding peacefully.
550,IN MAY,
551,IN MAY,From pool to pool it prattles by;
552,IN MAY,"The flashing swallows dip and pass,"
553,IN MAY,"Above the tufted marish grass,"
554,IN MAY,And here at rest am I.
555,IN MAY,
556,IN MAY,"I care not for the old distress,"

625,JUNE,That pale-browed April passed with pensive tread
626,JUNE,"Through the frore woods, and from its frost-bound bed"
627,JUNE,Woke the arbutus with her silver horn;
628,JUNE,"And now May, too, is fled,"
629,JUNE,"The flower-crowned month, the merry laughing May,"
630,JUNE,"With rosy feet and fingers dewy wet,"
631,JUNE,Leaving the woods and all cool gardens gay
632,JUNE,With tulips and the scented violet.
633,JUNE,
634,JUNE,Gone are the wind-flower and the adder-tongue
635,JUNE,"And the sad drooping bellwort, and no more"
636,JUNE,The snowy trilliums crowd the forest's floor;
637,JUNE,"The purpling grasses are no longer young,"
638,JUNE,And summer's wide-set door
639,JUNE,O'er the thronged hills and the broad panting earth
640,JUNE,"Lets in the torrent of the later bloom,"
641,JUNE,"Haytime, and harvest, and the after mirth,"
642,JUNE,"The slow soft rain, the rushing thunder plume."
643,JUNE,
644,JUNE,"All day in garden alleys moist and dim,"
645,JUNE,The humid air is burdened with the rose;
646,JUNE,In moss-deep woods the creamy orchid blows;
647,JUNE,And now the vesper-sparrows' pealing hymn
648,JUNE,From every orchard close
649,JUNE,At eve comes flooding rich and silvery;
650,JUNE,The daisies in great meadows swing and shine;
651,JUNE,And with the wind a sound as of the sea
652,JUNE,Roars in the maples and the topmost pine.
653,JUNE,
654,JUNE,High in the hills the solitary thrush
655,JUNE,"Tunes magically his music of fine dreams,"
656,JUNE,"In briary dells, by boulder-broken streams;"
657,JUNE,And wide and far on nebulous fields aflush
658,JUNE,The mellow morning gleams.
659,JUNE,"The orange cone-flowers purple-bossed are there,"
660,JUNE,"The meadow's bold-eyed gypsies deep of hue,"
661,JUNE,"And slender hawkweed tall and softly fair,"
662,JUNE,And rosy tops of fleabane veiled with dew.
663,JUNE,
664,JUNE,So with thronged voices and unhasting flight
665,JUNE,The fervid hours with long return go by;
666,JUNE,The far-heard hylas piping shrill and high
667,JUNE,Tell the slow moments of the solemn night
668,JUNE,With unremitting cry;
669,JUNE,Lustrous and large out of the gathering drouth
670,JUNE,The planets gleam; the baleful Scorpion
671,JUNE,Trails his dim fires along the droused south;
672,JUNE,The silent world-incrusted round moves on.
673,JUNE,
674,JUNE,And all the dim night long the moon's white beams
675,JUNE,"Nestle deep down in every brooding tree,"
676,JUNE,"And sleeping birds, touched with a silly glee,"
677,JUNE,"Waken at midnight from their blissful dreams,"
678,JUNE,And carol brokenly.
679,JUNE,Dim surging motions and uneasy dreads
680,JUNE,"Scare the light slumber from men's busy eyes,"
681,JUNE,And parted lovers on their restless beds
682,JUNE,"Toss and yearn out, and cannot sleep for sighs."
683,JUNE,
684,JUNE,"Oft have I striven, sweet month, to figure thee,"
685,JUNE,"As dreamers of old time were wont to feign,"
686,JUNE,"In living form of flesh, and striven in vain;"
687,JUNE,Yet when some sudden old-world mystery
688,JUNE,"Of passion fired my brain,"
689,JUNE,"Thy shape hath flashed upon me like no dream,"
690,JUNE,"Wandering with scented curls that heaped the breeze,"
691,JUNE,Or by the hollow of some reeded stream
692,JUNE,Sitting waist-deep in white anemones;
693,JUNE,
694,JUNE,"And even as I glimpsed thee thou wert gone,"
695,JUNE,"A dream for mortal eyes too proudly coy,"
696,JUNE,Yet in thy place for subtle thought's employ
697,JUNE,"The golden magic clung, a light that shone"
698,JUNE,And filled me with thy joy.
699,JUNE,Before me like a mist that streamed and fell
700,JUNE,All names and shapes of antique beauty passed
701,JUNE,In garlanded procession with the swell
702,JUNE,"Of flutes between the beechen stems; and last,"
703,JUNE,
704,JUNE,"I saw the Arcadian valley, the loved wood,"
705,JUNE,"Alpheus stream divine, the sighing shore,"
706,JUNE,"And through the cool green glades, awake once more,"
707,JUNE,"Psyche, the white-limbed goddess, still pursued,"
708,JUNE,"Fleet-footed as of yore,"
709,JUNE,"The noonday ringing with her frighted peals,"
710,JUNE,"Down the bright sward and through the reeds she ran,"
711,JUNE,"Urged by the mountain echoes, at her heels"

974,AT THE FERRY,On such a day the shrunken stream
975,AT THE FERRY,Spends its last water and runs dry;
976,AT THE FERRY,Clouds like far turrets in a dream
977,AT THE FERRY,Stand baseless in the burning sky.
978,AT THE FERRY,On such a day at every rod
979,AT THE FERRY,"The toilers in the hay-field halt,"
980,AT THE FERRY,"With dripping brows, and the parched sod"
981,AT THE FERRY,Yields to the crushing foot like salt.
982,AT THE FERRY,
983,AT THE FERRY,"But here a little wind astir,"
984,AT THE FERRY,"Seen waterward in jetting lines,"
985,AT THE FERRY,From yonder hillside topped with fir
986,AT THE FERRY,Comes pungent with the breath of pines;
987,AT THE FERRY,"And here when all the noon hangs still,"
988,AT THE FERRY,"White-hot upon the city tiles,"
989,AT THE FERRY,A perfume and a wintry chill
990,AT THE FERRY,Breathe from the yellow lumber-piles.
991,AT THE FERRY,
992,AT THE FERRY,And all day long there falls a blur
993,AT THE FERRY,"Of noises upon listless ears,"
994,AT THE FERRY,"The rumble of the trams, the stir"
995,AT THE FERRY,Of barges at the clacking piers;
996,AT THE FERRY,"The champ of wheels, the crash of steam,"
997,AT THE FERRY,"And ever, without change or stay,"
998,AT THE FERRY,"The drone, as through a troubled dream,"
999,AT THE FERRY,Of waters falling far away.
1000,AT THE FERRY,
1001,AT THE FERRY,A tug-boat up the farther shore
1002,AT THE FERRY,"Half pants, half whistles, in her draught;"
1003,AT THE FERRY,The cadence of a creaking oar
1004,AT THE FERRY,Falls drowsily; a corded raft
1005,AT THE FERRY,"Creeps slowly in the noonday gleam,"
1006,AT THE FERRY,And wheresoe'er a shadow sleeps
1007,AT THE FERRY,"The men lie by, or half a-dream,"
1008,AT THE FERRY,Stand leaning at the idle sweeps.
1009,AT THE FERRY,
1010,AT THE FERRY,And all day long in the quiet bay
1011,AT THE FERRY,"The eddying amber depths retard,"
1012,AT THE FERRY,"And hold, as in a ring, at play,"
1013,AT THE FERRY,The heavy saw-logs notched and scarred;
1014,AT THE FERRY,"And yonder between cape and shoal,"
1015,AT THE FERRY,"Where the long currents swing and shift,"
1016,AT THE FERRY,An aged punt-man with his pole
1017,AT THE FERRY,Is searching in the parted drift.
1018,AT THE FERRY,
1019,AT THE FERRY,At moments from the distant glare
1020,AT THE FERRY,The murmur of a railway steals
1021,AT THE FERRY,Round yonder jutting point the air
1022,AT THE FERRY,Is beaten with the puff of wheels;
1023,AT THE FERRY,"And here at hand an open mill,"
1024,AT THE FERRY,"Strong clamor at perpetual drive,"
1025,AT THE FERRY,"With changing chant, now hoarse, now shrill,"
1026,AT THE FERRY,Keeps dinning like a mighty hive.
1027,AT THE FERRY,
1028,AT THE FERRY,"A furnace over field and mead,"
1029,AT THE FERRY,The rounding noon hangs hard and white;
1030,AT THE FERRY,Into the gathering heats recede
1031,AT THE FERRY,The hollows of the Chelsea height;
1032,AT THE FERRY,"But under all to one quiet tune,"
1033,AT THE FERRY,"A spirit in cool depths withdrawn,"
1034,AT THE FERRY,"With logs, and dust, and wrack bestrewn,"
1035,AT THE FERRY,The stately river journeys on.
1036,AT THE FERRY,
1037,AT THE FERRY,I watch the swinging currents go
1038,AT THE FERRY,"Far down to where, enclosed and piled,"
1039,AT THE FERRY,"The logs crowd, and the Gatineau"
1040,AT THE FERRY,Comes rushing from the northern wild.
1041,AT THE FERRY,"I see the long low point, where close"
1042,AT THE FERRY,"The shore-lines, and the waters end,"
1043,AT THE FERRY,I watch the barges pass in rows
1044,AT THE FERRY,That vanish at the tapering bend.
1045,AT THE FERRY,
1046,AT THE FERRY,I see as at the noon's pale core--
1047,AT THE FERRY,A shadow that lifts clear and floats--
1048,AT THE FERRY,"The cabin'd village round the shore,"
1049,AT THE FERRY,The landing and the fringe of boats;
1050,AT THE FERRY,"Faint films of smoke that curl and wreathe,"
1051,AT THE FERRY,And upward with the like desire
1052,AT THE FERRY,The vast gray church that seems to breathe
1053,AT THE FERRY,In heaven with its dreaming spire.
1054,AT THE FERRY,
1055,AT THE FERRY,"And there the last blue boundaries rise,"
1056,AT THE FERRY,That guard within their compass furled
1057,AT THE FERRY,This plot of earth: beyond them lies
1058,AT THE FERRY,The mystery of the echoing world;
1059,AT THE FERRY,"And still my thought goes on, and yields"
1060,AT THE FERRY,"New vision and new joy to me,"
1061,AT THE FERRY,"Far peopled hills, and ancient fields,"
1062,AT THE FERRY,And cities by the crested sea.
1063,AT THE FERRY,
1064,AT THE FERRY,"I see no more the barges pass,"
1065,AT THE FERRY,"Nor mark the ripple round the pier,"
1066,AT THE FERRY,"And all the uproar, mass on mass,"
1067,AT THE FERRY,Falls dead upon a vacant ear.
1068,AT THE FERRY,"Beyond the tumult of the mills,"
1069,AT THE FERRY,"And all the city's sound and strife,"

1089,SEPTEMBER,"Children of light, too fearful of the gloom;"
1090,SEPTEMBER,"The sun falls low, the secret word is said,"

1093,SEPTEMBER,"The cone-flower and the marguerite; and no more,"
1094,SEPTEMBER,"Across the river's shadow-haunted floor,"
1095,SEPTEMBER,The paths of skimming swallows interlace.
1096,SEPTEMBER,
1097,SEPTEMBER,Already in the outland wilderness
1098,SEPTEMBER,The forests echo with unwonted dins;
1099,SEPTEMBER,In clamorous gangs the gathering woodmen press
1100,SEPTEMBER,"Northward, and the stern winter's toil begins."
1101,SEPTEMBER,"Around the long low shanties, whose rough lines"
1102,SEPTEMBER,"Break the sealed dreams of many an unnamed lake,"
1103,SEPTEMBER,Already in the frost-clear morns awake
1104,SEPTEMBER,The crash and thunder of the falling pines.
1105,SEPTEMBER,
1106,SEPTEMBER,"Where the tilled earth, with all its fields set free,"
1107,SEPTEMBER,"Naked and yellow from the harvest lies,"
1108,SEPTEMBER,"By many a loft and busy granary,"

1114,SEPTEMBER,
1115,SEPTEMBER,"Still a brief while, ere the old year quite pass,"
1116,SEPTEMBER,Our wandering steps and wistful eyes shall greet
1117,SEPTEMBER,"The leaf, the water, the beloved grass;"
1118,SEPTEMBER,Still from these haunts and this accustomed seat
1119,SEPTEMBER,"I see the wood-wrapt city, swept with light,"
1120,SEPTEMBER,"The blue long-shadowed distance, and, between,"
1121,SEPTEMBER,"The dotted farm-lands with their parcelled green,"
1122,SEPTEMBER,The dark pine forest and the watchful height.
1123,SEPTEMBER,
1124,SEPTEMBER,I see the broad rough meadow stretched away
1125,SEPTEMBER,"Into the crystal sunshine, wastes of sod,"
1126,SEPTEMBER,"Acres of withered vervain, purple-gray,"
1127,SEPTEMBER,"Branches of aster, groves of goldenrod;"
1128,SEPTEMBER,"And yonder, toward the sunlit summit, strewn"
1129,SEPTEMBER,"With shadowy boulders, crowned and swathed with weed,"
1130,SEPTEMBER,"Stand ranks of silken thistles, blown to seed,"
1131,SEPTEMBER,Long silver fleeces shining like the noon.
1132,SEPTEMBER,
1133,SEPTEMBER,"In far-off russet corn-fields, where the dry"
1134,SEPTEMBER,"Gray shocks stand peaked and withering, half concealed"
1135,SEPTEMBER,"In the rough earth, the orange pumpkins lie,"
1136,SEPTEMBER,Full-ribbed; and in the windless pasture-field
1137,SEPTEMBER,The sleek red horses o'er the sun-warmed ground
1138,SEPTEMBER,"Stand pensively about in companies,"
1139,SEPTEMBER,While all around them from the motionless trees
1140,SEPTEMBER,The long clean shadows sleep without a sound.
1141,SEPTEMBER,
1142,SEPTEMBER,"Under cool elm-trees floats the distant stream,"
1143,SEPTEMBER,Moveless as air; and o'er the vast warm earth
1144,SEPTEMBER,"The fathomless daylight seems to stand and dream,"
1145,SEPTEMBER,A liquid cool elixir--all its girth
1146,SEPTEMBER,"Bound with faint haze, a frail transparency,"
1147,SEPTEMBER,Whose lucid purple barely veils and fills
1148,SEPTEMBER,"The utmost valleys and the thin last hills,"
1149,SEPTEMBER,Nor mars one whit their perfect clarity.
1150,SEPTEMBER,
1151,SEPTEMBER,"Thus without grief the golden days go by,"
1152,SEPTEMBER,"So soft we scarcely notice how they wend,"
1153,SEPTEMBER,"And like a smile half happy, or a sigh,"
1154,SEPTEMBER,The summer passes to her quiet end;
1155,SEPTEMBER,"And soon, too soon, around the cumbered eaves"
1156,SEPTEMBER,"Sly frosts shall take the creepers by surprise,"
1157,SEPTEMBER,And through the wind-touched reddening woods shall rise
1158,SEPTEMBER,October with the rain of ruined leaves.

1248,IN NOVEMBER,"A clearing, where the broken ground"

1256,IN NOVEMBER,"In that mute opening of the wood,"

1356,SNOWBIRDS,Along the narrow sandy height
1357,SNOWBIRDS,"I watch them swiftly come and go,"
1358,SNOWBIRDS,"Or round the leafless wood,"
1359,SNOWBIRDS,"Like flurries of wind-driven snow,"
1360,SNOWBIRDS,"Revolving in perpetual flight,"
1361,SNOWBIRDS,A changing multitude.
1362,SNOWBIRDS,
1363,SNOWBIRDS,"Nearer and nearer still they sway,"
1364,SNOWBIRDS,"And, scattering in a circled sweep,"
1365,SNOWBIRDS,Rush down without a sound;
1366,SNOWBIRDS,"And now I see them peer and peep,"
1367,SNOWBIRDS,"Across yon level bleak and gray,"
1368,SNOWBIRDS,"Searching the frozen ground,--"
1369,SNOWBIRDS,
1370,SNOWBIRDS,"Until a little wind upheaves,"
1371,SNOWBIRDS,"And makes a sudden rustling there,"
1372,SNOWBIRDS,"And then they drop their play,"
1373,SNOWBIRDS,"Flash up into the sunless air,"
1374,SNOWBIRDS,And like a flight of silver leaves
1375,SNOWBIRDS,Swirl round and sweep away.

1384,SNOW,The fading forests grow;
1385,SNOW,"The wind dies out along the height,"
1386,SNOW,"And denser still the snow,"
1387,SNOW,"A gathering weight on roof and tree,"
1388,SNOW,Falls down scarce audibly.
1389,SNOW,
1390,SNOW,The road before me smooths and fills
1391,SNOW,"Apace, and all about"
1392,SNOW,"The fences dwindle, and the hills"
1393,SNOW,Are blotted slowly out;
1394,SNOW,The naked trees loom spectrally
1395,SNOW,Into the dim white sky.
1396,SNOW,
1397,SNOW,The meadows and far-sheeted streams
1398,SNOW,Lie still without a sound;
1399,SNOW,Like some soft minister of dreams
1400,SNOW,The snow-fall hoods me round;
1401,SNOW,"In wood and water, earth and air,"
1402,SNOW,A silence everywhere.
1403,SNOW,
1404,SNOW,Save when at lonely intervals
1405,SNOW,"Some farmer's sleigh, urged on,"
1406,SNOW,"With rustling runners and sharp bells,"
1407,SNOW,Swings by me and is gone;
1408,SNOW,Or from the empty waste I hear
1409,SNOW,A sound remote and clear;
1410,SNOW,
1411,SNOW,"The barking of a dog, or call"
1412,SNOW,"To cattle, sharply pealed,"
1413,SNOW,Borne echoing from some wayside stall
1414,SNOW,Or barnyard far a-field;
1415,SNOW,"Then all is silent, and the snow"
1416,SNOW,"Falls, settling soft and slow."
1417,SNOW,
1418,SNOW,"The evening deepens, and the gray"
1419,SNOW,Folds closer earth and sky;
1420,SNOW,The world seems shrouded far away;
1421,SNOW,"Its noises sleep, and I,"
1422,SNOW,"As secret as yon buried stream,"
1423,SNOW,"Plod dumbly on, and dream."

1435,SUNSET,"Cupola and pointed tower,"

1448,SUNSET,Slowly from the olive sky;

1450,SUNSET,Till the thin clouds wear away
1451,SUNSET,"Into threads of purple-gray,"

1453,SUNSET,Brighten in the pallid green;

1456,SUNSET,"Slow return√®d one by one,"
1457,SUNSET,Like pale prisoners released
1458,SUNSET,"From the dungeons of the sun,"
1459,SUNSET,Capella and her train appear
1460,SUNSET,In the glittering Charioteer;

1462,SUNSET,Till the rounded moon shall grow
1463,SUNSET,"Great above the eastern snow,"

1477,WINTER-STORE,"Through the cloudy chrysalis,"
1478,WINTER-STORE,See the wonder as it is.
1479,WINTER-STORE,"Down a narrow alley, blind,"
1480,WINTER-STORE,"Touch and vision, heart and mind;"
1481,WINTER-STORE,"Turned sharply inward, still we plod,"
1482,WINTER-STORE,Till the calmly smiling god
1483,WINTER-STORE,"Leaves us, and our spirits grow"
1484,WINTER-STORE,"More thin, more acrid, as we go."
1485,WINTER-STORE,"Creeping by the sullen wall,"
1486,WINTER-STORE,"We forego the power to see,"
1487,WINTER-STORE,"The threads that bind us to the All,"
1488,WINTER-STORE,God or the Immensity;

1490,WINTER-STORE,Man is but a passing mode.
1491,WINTER-STORE,
1492,WINTER-STORE,"Too blind we are, too little see"
1493,WINTER-STORE,"Of the magic pageantry,"
1494,WINTER-STORE,"Every minute, every hour,"
1495,WINTER-STORE,"From the cloudflake to the flower,"
1496,WINTER-STORE,"Forever old, forever strange,"
1497,WINTER-STORE,Issuing in perpetual change
1498,WINTER-STORE,From the rainbow gates of Time.

1501,WINTER-STORE,"Surely knows the great and fair,"

1508,WINTER-STORE,"Bending with unveil√®d face,"
1509,WINTER-STORE,Fills him in her divine employ
1510,WINTER-STORE,With her own majestic joy.
1511,WINTER-STORE,
1512,WINTER-STORE,"Up the fielded slopes at morn,"
1513,WINTER-STORE,"Where light wefts of shadow pass,"
1514,WINTER-STORE,"Films upon the bending corn,"
1515,WINTER-STORE,I shall sweep the purple grass.
1516,WINTER-STORE,"Sun-crowned heights and mossy woods,"
1517,WINTER-STORE,"And the outer solitudes,"
1518,WINTER-STORE,"Mountain-valleys, dim with pine,"
1519,WINTER-STORE,Shall be home and haunt of mine.
1520,WINTER-STORE,"I shall search in crannied hollows,"
1521,WINTER-STORE,"Where the sunlight scarcely follows,"
1522,WINTER-STORE,And the secret forest brook
1523,WINTER-STORE,"Murmurs, and from nook to nook"
1524,WINTER-STORE,"Forever downward curls and cools,"
1525,WINTER-STORE,Frothing in the bouldered pools.
1526,WINTER-STORE,
1527,WINTER-STORE,Many a noon shall find me laid
1528,WINTER-STORE,"In the pungent balsam shade,"
1529,WINTER-STORE,Where sharp breezes spring and shiver
1530,WINTER-STORE,"On some deep rough-coasted river,"
1531,WINTER-STORE,"And the plangent waters come,"
1532,WINTER-STORE,Amber-hued and streaked with foam;
1533,WINTER-STORE,Where beneath the sunburnt hills
1534,WINTER-STORE,All day long the crowded mills
1535,WINTER-STORE,With remorseless champ and scream
1536,WINTER-STORE,"Overlord the sluicing stream,"
1537,WINTER-STORE,And the rapids' iron roar
1538,WINTER-STORE,Hammers at the forest's core;
1539,WINTER-STORE,"Where corded rafts creep slowly on,"
1540,WINTER-STORE,"Glittering in the noonday sun,"
1541,WINTER-STORE,"And the tawny river-dogs,"
1542,WINTER-STORE,"Shepherding the branded logs,"
1543,WINTER-STORE,Bind and heave with cadenced cry;
1544,WINTER-STORE,"Where the blackened tugs go by,"
1545,WINTER-STORE,"Panting hard and straining slow,"
1546,WINTER-STORE,"Laboring at the weighty tow,"
1547,WINTER-STORE,"Flat-nosed barges all in trim,"
1548,WINTER-STORE,"Creeping in long cumbrous line,"
1549,WINTER-STORE,Loaded to the water's brim
1550,WINTER-STORE,"With the clean, cool-scented pine."
1551,WINTER-STORE,
1552,WINTER-STORE,"Perhaps in some low meadow-land,"
1553,WINTER-STORE,"Stretching wide on either hand,"
1554,WINTER-STORE,I shall see the belted bees
1555,WINTER-STORE,Rocking with the tricksy breeze
1556,WINTER-STORE,"In the spir√®d meadow-sweet,"
1557,WINTER-STORE,Or with eager trampling feet
1558,WINTER-STORE,"Burrowing in the boneset blooms,"
1559,WINTER-STORE,Treading out the dry perfumes.
1560,WINTER-STORE,Where sun-hot hay-fields newly mown
1561,WINTER-STORE,"Climb the hillside ruddy brown,"
1562,WINTER-STORE,"I shall see the haymakers,"
1563,WINTER-STORE,"While the noonday scarcely stirs,"
1564,WINTER-STORE,"Brown of neck and booted gray,"
1565,WINTER-STORE,"Tossing up the rustling hay,"
1566,WINTER-STORE,"While the hay-racks bend and rock,"
1567,WINTER-STORE,"As they take each scented cock,"
1568,WINTER-STORE,Jolting over dip and rise;
1569,WINTER-STORE,And the wavering butterflies
1570,WINTER-STORE,O'er the spaces brown and bare
1571,WINTER-STORE,Light and wander here and there.
1572,WINTER-STORE,
1573,WINTER-STORE,"I shall stray by many a stream,"
1574,WINTER-STORE,Where the half-shut lilies gleam.
1575,WINTER-STORE,Napping out the sultry days
1576,WINTER-STORE,In the quiet secluded bays;
1577,WINTER-STORE,"Where the tasseled rushes tower,"
1578,WINTER-STORE,O'er the purple pickerel-flower.
1579,WINTER-STORE,And the floating dragon-fly--
1580,WINTER-STORE,Azure glint and crystal gleam--
1581,WINTER-STORE,Watches o'er the burnished stream
1582,WINTER-STORE,With his eye of ebony;
1583,WINTER-STORE,Where the bull-frog lolls at rest
1584,WINTER-STORE,"On his float of lily-leaves,"
1585,WINTER-STORE,"That the swaying water weaves,"
1586,WINTER-STORE,"And distends his yellow breast,"
1587,WINTER-STORE,Lowing out from shore to shore
1588,WINTER-STORE,With a hollow vibrant roar;
1589,WINTER-STORE,Where the softest wind that blows
1590,WINTER-STORE,"As it lightly comes and goes,"
1591,WINTER-STORE,"O'er the jungled river meads,"
1592,WINTER-STORE,"Stirs a whisper in the reeds,"
1593,WINTER-STORE,And wakes the crowded bull-rushes
1594,WINTER-STORE,"From their stately reveries,"
1595,WINTER-STORE,Flashing through their long-leaved hordes
1596,WINTER-STORE,Like a brandishing of swords;
1597,WINTER-STORE,"There, too, the frost-like arrow-flowers"
1598,WINTER-STORE,"Tremble to the golden core,"
1599,WINTER-STORE,"Children of enchanted hours,"
1600,WINTER-STORE,Whom the rustling river bore
1601,WINTER-STORE,"In the night's bewildered noon,"
1602,WINTER-STORE,Woven of water and the moon.
1603,WINTER-STORE,
1604,WINTER-STORE,I shall hear the grasshoppers
1605,WINTER-STORE,"From the parched grass rehearse,"
1606,WINTER-STORE,And with drowsy note prolong
1607,WINTER-STORE,Evermore the same thin song.
1608,WINTER-STORE,I shall hear the crickets tell
1609,WINTER-STORE,"Stories by the humming well,"
1610,WINTER-STORE,"And mark the locust, with quaint eyes,"
1611,WINTER-STORE,Caper in his cloak of gray
1612,WINTER-STORE,Like a jester in disguise
1613,WINTER-STORE,Rattling by the dusty way.
1614,WINTER-STORE,
1615,WINTER-STORE,"I shall dream by upland fences,"
1616,WINTER-STORE,Where the season's wealth condenses
1617,WINTER-STORE,"Over many a weedy wreck,"
1618,WINTER-STORE,"Wild, uncared-for, desert places,"
1619,WINTER-STORE,That sovereign Beauty loves to deck
1620,WINTER-STORE,"With her softest, dearest graces."
1621,WINTER-STORE,"There the long year dreams in quiet,"
1622,WINTER-STORE,And the summer's strength runs riot.
1623,WINTER-STORE,"Shall I not remember these,"
1624,WINTER-STORE,Deep in winter reveries?
1625,WINTER-STORE,"Berried brier and thistle-bloom,"
1626,WINTER-STORE,And milkweed with its dense perfume;
1627,WINTER-STORE,Slender vervain towering up
1628,WINTER-STORE,"In a many-branch√®d cup,"
1629,WINTER-STORE,"Like a candlestick, each spire"
1630,WINTER-STORE,Kindled with a violet fire;
1631,WINTER-STORE,"Matted creepers and wild cherries,"
1632,WINTER-STORE,"Purple-bunch√®d elderberries,"
1633,WINTER-STORE,And on scanty plots of sod
1634,WINTER-STORE,Groves of branchy goldenrod.
1635,WINTER-STORE,
1636,WINTER-STORE,"What though autumn mornings now,"
1637,WINTER-STORE,"Winterward with glittering brow,"
1638,WINTER-STORE,Stiffen in the silver grass;
1639,WINTER-STORE,"And what though robins flock and pass,"
1640,WINTER-STORE,"With subdued and sober call,"
1641,WINTER-STORE,To the old year's funeral;
1642,WINTER-STORE,Though October's crimson leaves
1643,WINTER-STORE,"Rustle at the gusty door,"
1644,WINTER-STORE,And the tempest round the eaves
1645,WINTER-STORE,Alternate with pipe and roar;
1646,WINTER-STORE,"I sit, as erst, unharmed, secure,"
1647,WINTER-STORE,"Conscious that my store is sure,"
1648,WINTER-STORE,"Whatsoe'er the fenc√®d fields,"
1649,WINTER-STORE,Or the untilled forest yields
1650,WINTER-STORE,"Of unhurt remembrances,"
1651,WINTER-STORE,"Or thoughts, far-glimpsed, half-followed, these"
1652,WINTER-STORE,"I have reaped and laid away,"
1653,WINTER-STORE,"A treasure of unwinnowed grain,"
1654,WINTER-STORE,To the garner packed and gray
1655,WINTER-STORE,Gathered without toil or strain.
1656,WINTER-STORE,
1657,WINTER-STORE,"And when the darker days shall come,"
1658,WINTER-STORE,And the fields are white and dumb;
1659,WINTER-STORE,"When our fires are half in vain,"
1660,WINTER-STORE,And the crystal starlight weaves
1661,WINTER-STORE,"Mockeries of summer leaves,"
1662,WINTER-STORE,Pictured on the icy pane;
1663,WINTER-STORE,When the high aurora gleams
1664,WINTER-STORE,Far above the Arctic streams
1665,WINTER-STORE,"Like a line of shifting spears,"
1666,WINTER-STORE,"And the broad pine-circled meres,"
1667,WINTER-STORE,"Glimmering in that spectral light,"
1668,WINTER-STORE,Thunder through the northern night;
1669,WINTER-STORE,Then within the bolted door
1670,WINTER-STORE,I shall con my summer store;
1671,WINTER-STORE,Though the fences scarcely show
1672,WINTER-STORE,"Black above the drifted snow,"
1673,WINTER-STORE,Though the icy sweeping wind
1674,WINTER-STORE,"Whistle in the empty tree,"
1675,WINTER-STORE,"Safe within the sheltered mind,"
1676,WINTER-STORE,I shall feed on memory.
1677,WINTER-STORE,
1678,WINTER-STORE,Yet across the windy night
1679,WINTER-STORE,Comes upon its wings a cry;
1680,WINTER-STORE,"Fashioned forms and modes take flight,"
1681,WINTER-STORE,And a vision sad and high
1682,WINTER-STORE,"Of the laboring world down there,"
1683,WINTER-STORE,"Where the lights burn red and warm,"
1684,WINTER-STORE,"Pricks my soul with sudden stare,"
1685,WINTER-STORE,Glowing through the veils of storm.
1686,WINTER-STORE,In the city yonder sleep
1687,WINTER-STORE,"Those who smile and those who weep,"
1688,WINTER-STORE,"Those whose lips are set with care,"
1689,WINTER-STORE,Those whose brows are smooth and fair;
1690,WINTER-STORE,Mourners whom the dawning light
1691,WINTER-STORE,Shall grapple with an old distress;
1692,WINTER-STORE,Lovers folded at midnight
1693,WINTER-STORE,In their bridal happiness;
1694,WINTER-STORE,"Pale watchers by belov√®d beds,"
1695,WINTER-STORE,"Fallen a-drowse with nodding heads,"
1696,WINTER-STORE,"Whom sleep captured by surprise,"
1697,WINTER-STORE,With the circles round their eyes;
1698,WINTER-STORE,"Maidens with quiet-taken breath,"
1699,WINTER-STORE,Dreaming of enchanted bowers;
1700,WINTER-STORE,Old men with the mask of death;
1701,WINTER-STORE,Little children soft as flowers;
1702,WINTER-STORE,Those who wake wild-eyed and start
1703,WINTER-STORE,In some madness of the heart;
1704,WINTER-STORE,Those whose lips and brows of stone
1705,WINTER-STORE,"Evil thoughts have graven upon,"
1706,WINTER-STORE,"Shade by shade and line by line,"
1707,WINTER-STORE,Refashioning what was once divine.
1708,WINTER-STORE,
1709,WINTER-STORE,"All these sleep, and through the night,"
1710,WINTER-STORE,"Comes a passion and a cry,"
1711,WINTER-STORE,"With a blind sorrow and a might,"
1712,WINTER-STORE,"I know not whence, I know not why,"
1713,WINTER-STORE,"A something I cannot control,"
1714,WINTER-STORE,A nameless hunger of the soul.
1715,WINTER-STORE,"It holds me fast. In vain, in vain,"
1716,WINTER-STORE,I remember how of old
1717,WINTER-STORE,"I saw the ruddy race of men,"
1718,WINTER-STORE,"Through the glittering world outrolled,"
1719,WINTER-STORE,"A gay-smiling multitude,"
1720,WINTER-STORE,"All immortal, all divine,"
1721,WINTER-STORE,Treading in a wreath√®d line
1722,WINTER-STORE,By a pathway through a wood.
