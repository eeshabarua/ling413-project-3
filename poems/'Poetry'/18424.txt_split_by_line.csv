107,THE SEABOARD.,THE SEABOARD.
108,THE SEABOARD.,
109,THE SEABOARD.,"The sea is at ebb, and the sound of her utmost word"
110,THE SEABOARD.,Is soft as the least wave's lapse in a still small reach.
111,THE SEABOARD.,"From bay into bay, on quest of a goal deferred,"
112,THE SEABOARD.,From headland ever to headland and breach to breach
113,THE SEABOARD.,Where earth gives ear to the message that all days preach
114,THE SEABOARD.,"With changes of gladness and sadness that cheer and chide,"
115,THE SEABOARD.,The lone way lures me along by a chance untried
116,THE SEABOARD.,"That haply, if hope dissolve not and faith be whole,"
117,THE SEABOARD.,"Not all for nought shall I seek, with a dream for guide."
118,THE SEABOARD.,"The goal that is not, and ever again the goal."
119,THE SEABOARD.,
120,THE SEABOARD.,The trackless ways are untravelled of sail or bird;
121,THE SEABOARD.,The hoar wave hardly recedes from the soundless beach.
122,THE SEABOARD.,"The silence of instant noon goes nigh to be heard,"
123,THE SEABOARD.,"The viewless void to be visible: all and each,"
124,THE SEABOARD.,A closure of calm no clamour of storm can breach
125,THE SEABOARD.,"Concludes and confines and absorbs them on either side,"
126,THE SEABOARD.,All forces of light and of life and the live world's pride.
127,THE SEABOARD.,Sands hardly ruffled of ripples that hardly roll
128,THE SEABOARD.,Seem ever to show as in reach of a swift brief stride
129,THE SEABOARD.,"The goal that is not, and ever again the goal."
130,THE SEABOARD.,
131,THE SEABOARD.,"The waves are a joy to the seamew, the meads to the herd,"
132,THE SEABOARD.,And a joy to the heart is a goal that it may not reach.
133,THE SEABOARD.,"No sense that for ever the limits of sense engird,"
134,THE SEABOARD.,"No hearing or sight that is vassal to form or speech,"
135,THE SEABOARD.,"Learns ever the secret that shadow and silence teach,"
136,THE SEABOARD.,"Hears ever the notes that or ever they swell subside,"
137,THE SEABOARD.,"Sees ever the light that lights not the loud world's tide,"
138,THE SEABOARD.,Clasps ever the cause of the lifelong scheme's control
139,THE SEABOARD.,"Wherethrough we pursue, till the waters of life be dried,"
140,THE SEABOARD.,"The goal that is not, and ever again the goal."
141,THE SEABOARD.,
142,THE SEABOARD.,"Friend, what have we sought or seek we, whate'er betide,"
143,THE SEABOARD.,"Though the seaboard shift its mark from afar descried,"
144,THE SEABOARD.,But aims whence ever anew shall arise the soul?
145,THE SEABOARD.,"Love, thought, song, life, but show for a glimpse and hide"
146,THE SEABOARD.,"The goal that is not, and ever again the goal."
147,THE SEABOARD.,

149,A HAVEN.,A HAVEN.
150,A HAVEN.,
151,A HAVEN.,"East and north a waste of waters, south and west"
152,A HAVEN.,"Lonelier lands than dreams in sleep would feign to be,"
153,A HAVEN.,"When the soul goes forth on travel, and is prest"
154,A HAVEN.,Round and compassed in with clouds that flash and flee
155,A HAVEN.,"Dells without a streamlet, downs without a tree,"
156,A HAVEN.,"Cirques of hollow cliff that crumble, give their guest"
157,A HAVEN.,"Little hope, till hard at hand he pause, to see"
158,A HAVEN.,"Where the small town smiles, a warm still sea-side nest."
159,A HAVEN.,
160,A HAVEN.,"Many a lone long mile, by many a headland's crest,"
161,A HAVEN.,"Down by many a garden dear to bird and bee,"
162,A HAVEN.,"Up by many a sea-down's bare and breezy breast,"
163,A HAVEN.,Winds the sandy strait of road where flowers run free.
164,A HAVEN.,Here along the deep steep lanes by field and lea
165,A HAVEN.,"Knights have carolled, pilgrims chanted, on their quest,"
166,A HAVEN.,"Haply, ere a roof rose toward the bleak strand's lee,"
167,A HAVEN.,"Where the small town smiles, a warm still sea-side nest."
168,A HAVEN.,
169,A HAVEN.,"Are the wild lands cursed perchance of time, or blest,"
170,A HAVEN.,Sad with fear or glad with comfort of the sea?
171,A HAVEN.,Are the ruinous towers of churches fallen on rest
172,A HAVEN.,"Watched of wanderers woful now, glad once as we,"
173,A HAVEN.,"When the night has all men's eyes and hearts in fee,"
174,A HAVEN.,When the soul bows down dethroned and dispossest?
175,A HAVEN.,"Yet must peace keep guard, by day's and night's decree,"
176,A HAVEN.,"Where the small town smiles, a warm still sea-side nest."
177,A HAVEN.,
178,A HAVEN.,"Friend, the lonely land is bright for you and me"
179,A HAVEN.,"All its wild ways through: but this methinks is best,"
180,A HAVEN.,Here to watch how kindly time and change agree
181,A HAVEN.,"Where the small town smiles, a warm still sea-side nest."
182,A HAVEN.,
183,A HAVEN.,
184,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.
185,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,
186,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"Along these low pleached lanes, on such a day,"
187,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"So soft a day as this, through shade and sun,"
188,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"With glad grave eyes that scanned the glad wild way,"
189,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"And heart still hovering o'er a song begun,"
190,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"And smile that warmed the world with benison,"
191,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"Our father, lord long since of lordly rhyme,"
192,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"Long since hath haply ridden, when the lime"
193,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"Bloomed broad above him, flowering where he came."
194,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"Because thy passage once made warm this clime,"
195,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"Our father Chaucer, here we praise thy name."
196,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,
197,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"Each year that England clothes herself with May,"
198,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,She takes thy likeness on her. Time hath spun
199,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,Fresh raiment all in vain and strange array
200,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"For earth and man's new spirit, fain to shun"
201,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"Things past for dreams of better to be won,"
202,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,Through many a century since thy funeral chime
203,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"Rang, and men deemed it death's most direful crime"
204,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,To have spared not thee for very love or shame;
205,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"And yet, while mists round last year's memories climb,"
206,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"Our father Chaucer, here we praise thy name."
207,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,
208,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"Each turn of the old wild road whereon we stray,"
209,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"Meseems, might bring us face to face with one"
210,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"Whom seeing we could not but give thanks, and pray"
211,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,For England's love our father and her son
212,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,To speak with us as once in days long done
213,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"With all men, sage and churl and monk and mime,"
214,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,Who knew not as we know the soul sublime
215,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,That sang for song's love more than lust of fame.
216,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"Yet, though this be not, yet, in happy time,"
217,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"Our father Chaucer, here we praise thy name."
218,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,
219,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"Friend, even as bees about the flowering thyme,"
220,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"Years crowd on years, till hoar decay begrime"
221,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"Names once beloved; but, seeing the sun the same,"
222,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"As birds of autumn fain to praise the prime,"
223,ON A COUNTRY ROAD.,"Our father Chaucer, here we praise thy name."

226,THE MILL GARDEN.,THE MILL GARDEN.
227,THE MILL GARDEN.,
228,THE MILL GARDEN.,"Stately stand the sunflowers, glowing down the garden-side,"
229,THE MILL GARDEN.,"Ranged in royal rank arow along the warm grey wall,"
230,THE MILL GARDEN.,"Whence their deep disks burn at rich midnoon afire with pride,"
231,THE MILL GARDEN.,"Even as though their beams indeed were sunbeams, and the tall"
232,THE MILL GARDEN.,"Sceptral stems bore stars whose reign endures, not flowers that fall."
233,THE MILL GARDEN.,"Lowlier laughs and basks the kindlier flower of homelier fame,"
234,THE MILL GARDEN.,"Held by love the sweeter that it blooms in Shakespeare's name,"
235,THE MILL GARDEN.,"Fragrant yet as though his hand had touched and made it thrill,"
236,THE MILL GARDEN.,"Like the whole world's heart, with warm new life and gladdening flame."
237,THE MILL GARDEN.,Fair befall the fair green close that lies below the mill!
238,THE MILL GARDEN.,
239,THE MILL GARDEN.,"Softlier here the flower-soft feet of refluent seasons glide,"
240,THE MILL GARDEN.,Lightlier breathes the long low note of change's gentler call.
241,THE MILL GARDEN.,"Wind and storm and landslip feed the lone sea's gulf outside,"
242,THE MILL GARDEN.,Half a seamew's first flight hence; but scarce may these appal
243,THE MILL GARDEN.,"Peace, whose perfect seal is set for signet here on all."
244,THE MILL GARDEN.,"Steep and deep and sterile, under fields no plough can tame,"
245,THE MILL GARDEN.,"Dip the cliffs full-fledged with poppies red as love or shame,"
246,THE MILL GARDEN.,"Wide wan daisies bleak and bold, or herbage harsh and chill;"
247,THE MILL GARDEN.,Here the full clove pinks and wallflowers crown the love they claim.
248,THE MILL GARDEN.,Fair befall the fair green close that lies below the mill!
249,THE MILL GARDEN.,
250,THE MILL GARDEN.,"All the place breathes low, but not for fear lest ill betide,"
251,THE MILL GARDEN.,"Soft as roses answering roses, or a dove's recall."
252,THE MILL GARDEN.,"Little heeds it how the seaward banks may stoop and slide,"
253,THE MILL GARDEN.,"How the winds and years may hold all outer things in thrall,"
254,THE MILL GARDEN.,How their wrath may work on hoar church tower and boundary wall.
255,THE MILL GARDEN.,Far and wide the waste and ravin of their rule proclaim
256,THE MILL GARDEN.,"Change alone the changeless lord of things, alone the same:"
257,THE MILL GARDEN.,"Here a flower is stronger than the winds that work their will,"
258,THE MILL GARDEN.,Or the years that wing their way through darkness toward their aim.
259,THE MILL GARDEN.,Fair befall the fair green close that lies below the mill!
260,THE MILL GARDEN.,
261,THE MILL GARDEN.,"Friend, the home that smiled us welcome hither when we came,"
262,THE MILL GARDEN.,"When we pass again with summer, surely should reclaim"

691,VII.,Till by the lips and eyes of one live nation
692,VII.,"The blind mute world found grace to see and speak,"
693,VII.,And light watched rise a more divine creation
694,VII.,"At that more godlike utterance of the Greek,"
695,VII.,Let there be freedom. Kings whose orient station
696,VII.,"Made pale the morn, and all her presage bleak,"
697,VII.,"Girt each with strengths of all his generation,"
698,VII.,"Dim tribes of shamefaced soul and sun-swart cheek,"
699,VII.,"Twice, urged with one desire,"
700,VII.,"Son following hard on sire,"
701,VII.,"With all the wrath of all a world to wreak,"
702,VII.,And all the rage of night
703,VII.,Afire against the light
704,VII.,"Whose weakness makes her strong-winged empire weak,"
705,VII.,"Stood up to unsay that saying, and fell"
706,VII.,"Too far for song, though song were thousand-tongued, to tell."
707,VII.,
708,VII.,
709,VIII.,VIII.
710,VIII.,
711,VIII.,From those deep echoes of the loud Ægean
712,VIII.,That rolled response whereat false fear was chid
713,VIII.,"By songs of joy sublime and Sophoclean,"
714,VIII.,Fresh notes reverberate westward rose to bid
715,VIII.,All wearier times take comfort from the pæan
716,VIII.,"That tells the night what deeds the sunrise did,"
717,VIII.,Even till the lawns and torrents Pyrenean
718,VIII.,Ring answer from the records of the Cid.
719,VIII.,But never force of fountains
720,VIII.,From sunniest hearts of mountains
721,VIII.,Wherein the soul of hidden June was hid
722,VIII.,Poured forth so pure and strong
723,VIII.,"Springs of reiterate song,"
724,VIII.,"Loud as the streams his fame was reared amid,"
725,VIII.,"More sweet than flowers they feed, and fair"
726,VIII.,With grace of lordlier sunshine and more lambent air.
727,VIII.,
728,VIII.,
729,IX.,IX.
730,IX.,
731,IX.,A star more prosperous than the storm-clothed east's
732,IX.,"Clothed all the warm south-west with light like spring's,"
733,IX.,When hands of strong men spread the wolves their feasts
734,IX.,And from snake-spirited princes plucked the stings;
735,IX.,"Ere earth, grown all one den of hurtling beasts,"
736,IX.,Had for her sunshine and her watersprings
737,IX.,"The fire of hell that warmed the hearts of priests,"
738,IX.,The wells of blood that slaked the lips of kings.
739,IX.,The shadow of night made stone
740,IX.,"Stood populous and alone,"
741,IX.,Dense with its dead and loathed of living things
742,IX.,"That draw not life from death,"
743,IX.,And as with hell's own breath
744,IX.,And clangour of immitigable wings
745,IX.,"Vexed the fair face of Paris, made"
746,IX.,Foul in its murderous imminence of sound and shade.
747,IX.,
748,IX.,
749,X.,X.
750,X.,
751,X.,And all these things were parcels of the vision
752,X.,"That moved a cloud before his eyes, or stood"
753,X.,A tower half shattered by the strong collision
754,X.,"Of spirit and spirit, of evil gods with good;"
755,X.,"A ruinous wall rent through with grim division,"
756,X.,Where time had marked his every monstrous mood
757,X.,Of scorn and strength and pride and self-derision:
758,X.,"The Tower of Things, that felt upon it brood"
759,X.,"Night, and about it cast"
760,X.,The storm of all the past
761,X.,Now mute and forceless as a fire subdued:
762,X.,Yet through the rifted years
763,X.,And centuries veiled with tears
764,X.,And ages as with very death imbrued
765,X.,"Freedom, whence hope and faith grow strong,"

771,XI.,"Above the cloudy coil of days deceased,"
772,XI.,"Its might of flight, with mists and storms beset,"
773,XI.,"Burns heavenward, as with heart and hope increased,"
774,XI.,"For all the change of tempests, all the fret"
775,XI.,"Of frost or fire, keen fraud or force released,"
776,XI.,Wherewith the world once wasted knows not yet
777,XI.,If evil or good lit all the darkling east
778,XI.,From the ardent moon of sovereign Mahomet.
779,XI.,Sublime in work and will
780,XI.,The song sublimer still
781,XI.,"Salutes him, ere the splendour shrink and set;"
782,XI.,Then with imperious eye
783,XI.,And wing that sounds the sky
784,XI.,Soars and sees risen as ghosts in concourse met
785,XI.,"The old world's seven elder wonders, firm"

792,XII.,Before death's face and empire's rings and glows
793,XII.,"Even from the dust their life poured forth left gory,"
794,XII.,As the eagle's cry rings after from the snows
795,XII.,Supreme rebuke of shame clothed round with glory
796,XII.,And hosts whose track the false crowned eagle shows;
797,XII.,More loud than sounds through stormiest song and story
798,XII.,The laugh of slayers whose names the sea-wind knows;
799,XII.,More loud than peals on land
800,XII.,In many a red wet hand
801,XII.,The clash of gold and cymbals as they close;
802,XII.,Loud as the blast that meets
803,XII.,The might of marshalled fleets
804,XII.,"And sheds it into shipwreck, like a rose"
805,XII.,Blown from a child's light grasp in sign
806,XII.,That earth's high lords are lords not over breeze and brine.

811,XIII.,Above the dust and mire of man's dejection

813,XIII.,His wingless and long-labouring resurrection
814,XIII.,"Up the arduous heaven, by sore and strange degrees"
815,XIII.,"Mount, and with splendour of the soul's reflection"
816,XIII.,"Strike heaven's dark sovereign down upon his knees,"
817,XIII.,"Pale in the light of orient insurrection,"
818,XIII.,And dumb before the almightier lord's decrees
819,XIII.,"Who bade him be of yore,"
820,XIII.,Who bids him be no more:
821,XIII.,"And all earth's heart is quickened as the sea's,"
822,XIII.,Even as when sunrise burns
823,XIII.,The very sea's heart yearns
824,XIII.,That heard not on the midnight-walking breeze
825,XIII.,The wail that woke with evensong
826,XIII.,From hearts of poor folk watching all the darkness long.

833,XIV.,By grace of weakness from the grave-mouthed gloom
834,XIV.,"Plucked, and by mercy lulled to living rest,"
835,XIV.,Soft as the nursling's nigh the grandsire's tomb
836,XIV.,"That fell on sleep, a bird of rifled nest;"
837,XIV.,Soft as the lips whose smile unsaid the doom
838,XIV.,That gave their sire to violent death's arrest.
839,XIV.,"Even for such love's sake strong,"
840,XIV.,Wrath fires the inveterate song
841,XIV.,That bids hell gape for one whose bland mouth blest
842,XIV.,All slayers and liars that sighed
843,XIV.,Prayer as they slew and lied
844,XIV.,"Till blood had clothed his priesthood as a vest,"
845,XIV.,"And hears, though darkness yet be dumb,"

852,XV.,"A star among them fed with life more dire,"
853,XV.,"Lit with his bloodied fame, whose withering rage"
854,XV.,Made earth for heaven's sake one funereal pyre
855,XV.,And life in faith's name one appointed stage
856,XV.,For death to purge the souls of men with fire.
857,XV.,"Heaven, earth, and hell on one thrice tragic page"
858,XV.,Mixed all their light and darkness: one man's lyre
859,XV.,Gave all their echoes voice;
860,XV.,"Bade rose-cheeked love rejoice,"
861,XV.,"And cold-lipped craft with ravenous fear conspire,"
862,XV.,And fire-eyed faith smite hope
863,XV.,"Dead, seeing enthroned as Pope"
864,XV.,And crowned of heaven on earth at hell's desire

872,XVI.,The consummating sound of song that spake
873,XVI.,Conclusion to the multitudinous word
874,XVI.,Whose expectation held her spirit awake
875,XVI.,Till full delight for twice twelve years deferred
876,XVI.,"Bade all souls entering eat and drink, and take"
877,XVI.,"A third time comfort given them, that the third"
878,XVI.,"Might heap the measure up of twain, and make"
879,XVI.,The sinking year sublime
880,XVI.,Among all sons of time
881,XVI.,And fan in all men's memories for his sake.
882,XVI.,Each thought of ours became
883,XVI.,"Fire, kindling from his flame,"
884,XVI.,And music widening in his wide song's wake.

894,XVII.,"Five days to die in yet were autumn's, ere"
895,XVII.,The last leaf withered from his flowerless wreath.
896,XVII.,"South, east, and north, our skies were all blown bare,"
897,XVII.,But westward over glimmering holt and heath
898,XVII.,"Cloud, wind, and light had made a heaven more fair"
899,XVII.,Than ever dream or truth
900,XVII.,Showed earth in time's keen youth
901,XVII.,When men with angels communed unaware.
902,XVII.,"Above the sun's head, now"
903,XVII.,"Veiled even to the ardent brow,"
904,XVII.,"Rose two sheer wings of sundering cloud, that were"

913,XVIII.,"Their living darkness, ominous else of dread,"
914,XVIII.,From south to northmost verge of heaven inclined
915,XVIII.,"Most like some giant angel's, whose bent head"
916,XVIII.,"Bowed earthward, as with message for mankind"
917,XVIII.,Of doom or benediction to be shed
918,XVIII.,"From passage of his presence. Far behind,"
919,XVIII.,"Even while they seemed to close,"
920,XVIII.,"Stoop, and take flight, arose"
921,XVIII.,"Above them, higher than heavenliest thought may find"
922,XVIII.,In light or night supreme
923,XVIII.,"Of vision or of dream,"
924,XVIII.,"Immeasurable of men's eyes or mounting mind,"

934,XIX.,"Of cloud suspense in rapture and repose,"
935,XIX.,"With large live petals, broad as love bids lie"
936,XIX.,"Full open when the sun salutes the rose,"
937,XIX.,And small rent sprays wherewith the heavens most high
938,XIX.,Were strewn as autumn strews the garden-close
939,XIX.,With ruinous roseleaves whirled
940,XIX.,"About their wan chill world,"
941,XIX.,"Through wind-worn bowers that now no music knows,"
942,XIX.,Spoil of the dim dusk year
943,XIX.,"Whose utter night is near,"
944,XIX.,And near the flower of dawn beyond it blows;

955,XX.,As though night's were not lifted up to slay
956,XX.,And day's had waxed not weaker. Peace more sweet
957,XX.,"Than music, light more soft than shadow, lay"
958,XX.,"On downs and moorlands wan with day's defeat,"
959,XX.,That watched afar above
960,XX.,Life's very rose of love
961,XX.,"Let all its lustrous leaves fall, fade, and fleet,"
962,XX.,And fill all heaven and earth
963,XX.,Full as with fires of birth
964,XX.,Whence time should feed his years with light and heat:
965,XX.,"Nay, not life's, but a flower more strong"

979,XXI.,"Westward, no brow so drear,"
980,XXI.,"No eye so dull of cheer,"
981,XXI.,"No face so mean whereon that light abode,"
982,XXI.,But as with alien pride
983,XXI.,Strange godhead glorified

995,XXII.,"Of all things visible in the wide world's eye,"

999,XXII.,Were filled from heaven above
1000,XXII.,"With light like fire of love,"

1004,XXII.,Light from the depth of souls more deep than they

1309,_LES CASQUETS._,"For her were the rocks clothed round with thunder,"
1310,_LES CASQUETS._,And the crests of them carved by the storm-smith's craft:

1312,_LES CASQUETS._,As with passion that wailed and laughed.
1313,_LES CASQUETS._,
1314,_LES CASQUETS._,For her the sunrise kindled and scattered
1315,_LES CASQUETS._,The red rose-leaflets of countless cloud:
1316,_LES CASQUETS._,For her the blasts of the springtide shattered
1317,_LES CASQUETS._,The strengths reluctant of waves back-bowed.
1318,_LES CASQUETS._,For her would winds in the mid sky levy
1319,_LES CASQUETS._,Bright wars that hardly the night bade cease
1320,_LES CASQUETS._,"At noon, when sleep on the sea lies heavy,"
1321,_LES CASQUETS._,For her would the sun make peace.
1322,_LES CASQUETS._,
1323,_LES CASQUETS._,Peace rose crowned with the dawn on golden
1324,_LES CASQUETS._,Lit leagues of triumph that flamed and smiled:
1325,_LES CASQUETS._,Peace lay lulled in the moon-beholden
1326,_LES CASQUETS._,Warm darkness making the world's heart mild
1327,_LES CASQUETS._,"For all the wide waves' troubles and treasons,"
1328,_LES CASQUETS._,One word only her soul's ear heard
1329,_LES CASQUETS._,"Speak from stormless and storm-rent seasons,"

1331,_LES CASQUETS._,
1332,_LES CASQUETS._,"All her life waxed large with the light of it,"
1333,_LES CASQUETS._,All her heart fed full on the sound:

1335,_LES CASQUETS._,Compassed and girdled and clothed with it round.
1336,_LES CASQUETS._,"Sense was none but a strong still rapture,"
1337,_LES CASQUETS._,"Spirit was none but a joy sublime,"
1338,_LES CASQUETS._,Of strength to curb and of craft to capture
1339,_LES CASQUETS._,The craft and the strength of Time.
1340,_LES CASQUETS._,
1341,_LES CASQUETS._,Time lay bound as in painless prison
1342,_LES CASQUETS._,"There, closed in with a strait small space."
1343,_LES CASQUETS._,Never thereon as a strange light risen
1344,_LES CASQUETS._,Change had unveiled for her grief's far face
1345,_LES CASQUETS._,Three white walls flung out from the basement
1346,_LES CASQUETS._,Girt the width of the world whereon
1347,_LES CASQUETS._,Gazing at night from her flame-lit casement
1348,_LES CASQUETS._,She saw where the dark sea shone.
1349,_LES CASQUETS._,
1350,_LES CASQUETS._,"Hardly the breadth of a few brief paces,"

1352,_LES CASQUETS._,The small court flower lit with children's faces
1353,_LES CASQUETS._,Scarce held scope for a bud to hide.
1354,_LES CASQUETS._,Yet here was a man's brood reared and hidden
1355,_LES CASQUETS._,"Between the rocks and the towers and the foam,"
1356,_LES CASQUETS._,Where peril and pity and peace were bidden
1357,_LES CASQUETS._,As guests to the same sure home.
1358,_LES CASQUETS._,
1359,_LES CASQUETS._,"Here would pity keep watch for peril,"
1360,_LES CASQUETS._,And surety comfort his heart with peace.
1361,_LES CASQUETS._,"No flower save one, where the reefs lie sterile,"
1362,_LES CASQUETS._,Gave of the seed of its heart's increase.
1363,_LES CASQUETS._,Pity and surety and peace most lowly
1364,_LES CASQUETS._,Were the root and the stem and the bloom of the flower:
1365,_LES CASQUETS._,And the light and the breath of the buds kept holy
1366,_LES CASQUETS._,That maid's else blossomless bower.
1367,_LES CASQUETS._,
1368,_LES CASQUETS._,"With never a leaf but the seaweed's tangle,"

1370,_LES CASQUETS._,"It heard all round it the strong storms wrangle,"
1371,_LES CASQUETS._,Watched far past it the waste wrecks float.
1372,_LES CASQUETS._,"But her soul was stilled by the sky's endurance,"
1373,_LES CASQUETS._,And her heart made glad with the sea's content;
1374,_LES CASQUETS._,And her faith waxed more in the sun's assurance
1375,_LES CASQUETS._,For the winds that came and went.
1376,_LES CASQUETS._,
1377,_LES CASQUETS._,Sweetness was brought for her forth of the bitter
1378,_LES CASQUETS._,"Sea's strength, and light of the deep sea's dark,"
1379,_LES CASQUETS._,From where green lawns on Alderney glitter
1380,_LES CASQUETS._,To the bastioned crags of the steeps of Sark.
1381,_LES CASQUETS._,"These she knew from afar beholden,"
1382,_LES CASQUETS._,And marvelled haply what life would be
1383,_LES CASQUETS._,"On moors that sunset and dawn leave golden,"
1384,_LES CASQUETS._,In dells that smile on the sea.
1385,_LES CASQUETS._,
1386,_LES CASQUETS._,"And forth she fared as a stout-souled rover,"
1387,_LES CASQUETS._,For a brief blithe raid on the bounding brine:
1388,_LES CASQUETS._,And light winds ferried her light bark over
1389,_LES CASQUETS._,To the lone soft island of fair-limbed kine.
1390,_LES CASQUETS._,"But the league-long length of its wild green border,"
1391,_LES CASQUETS._,"And the small bright streets of serene St. Anne,"
1392,_LES CASQUETS._,Perplexed her sense with a strange disorder
1393,_LES CASQUETS._,At sight of the works of man.
1394,_LES CASQUETS._,
1395,_LES CASQUETS._,"The world was here, and the world's confusion,"
1396,_LES CASQUETS._,"And the dust of the wheels of revolving life,"
1397,_LES CASQUETS._,"Pain, labour, change, and the fierce illusion"
1398,_LES CASQUETS._,Of strife more vain than the sea's old strife.
1399,_LES CASQUETS._,"And her heart within her was vexed, and dizzy"
1400,_LES CASQUETS._,The sense of her soul as a wheel that whirled:
1401,_LES CASQUETS._,She might not endure for a space that busy
1402,_LES CASQUETS._,Loud coil of the troublous world.
1403,_LES CASQUETS._,
1404,_LES CASQUETS._,"Too full, she said, was the world of trouble,"
1405,_LES CASQUETS._,"Too dense with noise of contentious things,"
1406,_LES CASQUETS._,And shews less bright than the blithe foam's bubble
1407,_LES CASQUETS._,As home she fared on the smooth wind's wings.
1408,_LES CASQUETS._,"For joy grows loftier in air more lonely,"
1409,_LES CASQUETS._,Where only the sea's brood fain would be;

1590,_AFTER A READING._,That it takes in the praise as it takes in the presence
1591,_AFTER A READING._,of eyes that fulfil it with joy;
1592,_AFTER A READING._,But how shall it praise them and rest unrebuked
1593,_AFTER A READING._,by the presence and pride of the boy?
1594,_AFTER A READING._,
1595,_AFTER A READING._,Praise meet for a child is unmeet for an elder

1602,_AFTER A READING._,The round little flower of a face that exults
1603,_AFTER A READING._,in the sunshine of shadowless days

1605,_AFTER A READING._,aught not unfit for the praise
1606,_AFTER A READING._,Of the sweetest of all things that eyes may rejoice in

1608,_AFTER A READING._,
1609,_AFTER A READING._,Such tricks and such meanings abound on the lips

1618,_AFTER A READING._,From the fervour of eyes and the fluttering of hands
1619,_AFTER A READING._,"in a foretaste of fancies and freaks,"
1620,_AFTER A READING._,When the thought of them deepens the dimples that laugh
1621,_AFTER A READING._,in the corners and curves of his cheeks.
1622,_AFTER A READING._,
1623,_AFTER A READING._,As a bird when the music within her is yet
1624,_AFTER A READING._,"too intense to be spoken in song,"
1625,_AFTER A READING._,That pauses a little for pleasure to feel
1626,_AFTER A READING._,"how the notes from withinwards throng,"

1631,_AFTER A READING._,all things of the dawn bear part
1632,_AFTER A READING._,With the tune that prevails when her passion has risen
1633,_AFTER A READING._,"into rapture of passionate art,"
1634,_AFTER A READING._,So lightens the laughter made perfect that leaps

1647,_AFTER A READING._,and rings when his bright thoughts break
1648,_AFTER A READING._,"In laughter that well might lure them to look,"
