145,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,
146,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,
147,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"There is an old Teutonic legend that every year, upon All Souls’ Day,"
148,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"the archangel Raphael is sent down to the classical ward of Hell, where"
149,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"the dispossessed deities of heathendom are confined, with a summons"
150,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,for the nine Muses to appear and give a command performance before
151,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,the throne of Jehovah and the assembled Host of Heaven. So the poor
152,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"embarrassed ladies, ushered before that critical and unsympathetic"
153,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"audience, reluctantly tune their lyres, and begin some ancient"
154,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"Hellenic chant, some ode, it may be, that they had once sung in the"
155,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"feasting-hall of Olympus, or at the marriage of Cadmus and Harmonia."
156,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,At first their strange pagan minstrelsy seems harsh and unpleasing to
157,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"blessed ears, accustomed only to the angelical modes of “saintly shout"
158,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"and solemn jubilee”; but before long, in spite of themselves, the"
159,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"angels are touched and troubled by this disquieting music, burdened"
160,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"with all the passions and sighs of humanity, until at last celestial"
161,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"visages are stained with tears, and the sound of weeping is heard in"
162,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,Heaven.
163,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,
164,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"But on one of these occasions, not so very long ago, after the Muses"
165,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"had come to the end of their program, several of the more literary"
166,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,archangels expressed a desire to hear some examples of post-classical
167,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"poetry, of which they knew little or nothing. As the Muses could"
168,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"not gratify their curiosity, Satan, who, as in the _Book of Job_,"
169,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"was paying one of his rare visits to the court of Jehovah, stepped"
170,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"into the breach, and beguiled several hours with poetical specimens"
171,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"from different periods, which he had picked up during his ceaseless"
172,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,wanderings to and fro upon the earth. At first his audience was
173,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"enchanted. He had an excellent ear and memory, and could reproduce"
174,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"perfectly the several styles of the troubadours and minnesingers,"
175,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,and of the various courtly or popular minstrels of the Middle Ages.
176,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,But gradually a change came over his performance. The saints and
177,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"angels grew puzzled and restless, as the element of song, and even"
178,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"of intonation, progressively disappeared, until at last they found"
179,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"themselves listening with pain and indignation to mere naked, spoken"
180,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"verse. And what verse? Rime they were familiar with in their hymns,"
181,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"and liked. But soon even rime began to fade, and threatened to vanish"
182,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,altogether. Metre too dissolved and degenerated from all regular
183,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,recognisable form; and when finally Satan jerked out the latest jewel
184,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"of American _vers libre_, he was greeted, as once before in Hell, with"
185,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"a dismal universal hiss, the sign of public scorn. The Muses had long"
186,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"ago fled down horror-stricken to Hades; and Satan, who always dislikes"
187,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"unpopularity, smiled, bowed, and retired. The choirmaster, Gabriel,"
188,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"tapped the desk with his baton, and a moment later the Heavenly Host"
189,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,was purging its offended ears with the strains of a noble Gregorian
190,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,chant.
191,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,
192,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"Now what lesson, if any, may we draw from this apologue?"
193,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"Were the angels right or wrong, or perhaps neither? Has the"
194,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"history of poetry been merely a deplorable tale of decadence, a"
195,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"progressive impoverishment and deterioration, through senility and"
196,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"second-childishness, towards an unlamented death in a bastard and"
197,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,graceless prose? Or on the contrary has the gradual divorce of poetry
198,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,from music and intoning meant its liberation for subtler and more
199,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"rational, but no less truly poetic purposes? Before attempting to"
200,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"answer such questions, let us first look at the historical facts."
201,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,
202,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"Homer, the fountain-head of Hellenic, and so of European poetry, though"
203,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"originally sung to the accompaniment of a lyre, was in later times"
204,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"intoned by professional rhapsodists, much as most Oriental poetry is"
205,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"intoned to this day. Greek lyrical poetry was of course always sung,"
206,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,whether chorally or by soloists. The dialogue of Greek plays was not
207,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"sung, but was probably intoned, or at least declaimed in a highly"
208,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"conventional and rhythmical manner, which was perhaps not so very"
209,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,unlike the still-surviving tradition of the Japanese Nō play-actors.
210,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"It is uncertain whether Horace intended his _Odes_ to be read, or to"
211,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,be sung to the lyre: but Lucretius and Virgil undoubtedly wrote their
212,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,poems to be read. Virgil indeed gave public readings of his _Eclogues_.
213,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"Probably, could we hear gramophone records of his performances, we"
214,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,should say that he was intoning rather than reading. However that may
215,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"be, his example set a fashion that was disastrous for Latin poetry."
216,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"His successors wrote more and more with a view to declamation, not in"
217,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"the noble Homeric manner, but in a style that was both bombastic and"
218,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,amateurish; and so poetry soon degenerated into stale rhetoric and
219,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,boredom.
220,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,
221,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"When after the lapse of centuries poetry emerged again, rejuvenated,"
222,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"its infant energies were still schooled by the same two mistresses,"
223,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,music and intonation. The art of the rhapsodists of the _Chanson
224,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"de gestes_ may have been ruder than that of the Homeridae, but its"
225,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,æsthetic character and its social function were much the same. And
226,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"for centuries the medieval lyric was intended to be sung, not read."
227,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,But with the multiplication of books the inevitable change began to
228,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"operate, and the medium of poetry came more and more to be verse spoken"
229,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"and read, rather than performed."
230,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,
231,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"The poetical drama of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was, from"
232,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"a historical point of view, no more than a brief and glorious episode."
233,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,The declamation of dramatic verse may well have been a great art on the
234,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"English, French and Spanish stage; but, if so, it has not survived into"
235,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"our own time, and shows little sign of resurrection. The development of"
236,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"polyphonic and instrumental music, while it has made modern opera and"
237,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"the _Lieder_ of Schubert and Brahms possible, seems to have destroyed"
238,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,all hope of an equal marriage between music and lyrical poetry. Modern
239,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"polyphony is a great art, but a tyrannous; and though a beautiful poem"
240,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"may still inspire a beautiful setting, the medium of the resulting"
241,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"work of art will be musical, and not poetic. Verse no doubt can still"
242,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"be declaimed, whether on the stage or elsewhere; but actors have"
243,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,generally neither taste nor tradition; the poets themselves have seldom
244,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,enough skill or training to be effective; and professional reciters
245,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"are “abominable, unutterable, and worse.” Thus it would seem that all"
246,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,the avenues which might lead to the public performance of poetry are
247,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"blocked. There are either no roads at all, or those that exist are in"
248,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,the possession of road-hogs. Is this state of things a disaster or no?
249,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"And if it be a disaster, are there any remedies to be found?"
250,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,
251,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,It is no doubt possible that so summary a diagnosis may be quite
252,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"misleading. Chaucer, it might be objected, already wrote for readers;"
253,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"and so did Milton. Yet many of us find them, and some of their"
254,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"successors, still quite readable. Surely then great poetry can still be"
255,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"both produced and enjoyed, even when it is completely divorced from"
256,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,music or intonation. All this may be true. Yet it is well to remember
257,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,that Chaucer was the immediate successor on the one hand of the English
258,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"and French minstrels, and on the other of Dante and Boccaccio, whose"
259,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,art in its turn grew directly out of that of the troubadours and the
260,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,Italian minstrels. And who have been the inheritors of Chaucer’s
261,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"art? Spenser, let us say, and in our time William Morris. Is it not"
262,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"possible that both Chaucer and Dante were peculiarly fortunate, in"
263,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,that their art had only quite recently emerged from the discipline of
264,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,a more primitive musical stage? Their successors may be said to have
265,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"deteriorated, the more purely literary they became, and the further"
266,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,removed from the Pierian fountain-head of minstrelsy. Then again
267,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"Milton, though more than any other English poet he was consciously the"
268,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"heir to all the ages, inherited his medium and his metrical technique"
269,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"directly from Shakespeare’s verse that was written, not for reading,"
270,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"but for dramatic performance, although no doubt Milton modified it"
271,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,considerably for his own undramatic purposes. As to the inheritors of
272,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"Milton’s art, such as Wordsworth and Keats, Matthew Arnold and Mr."
273,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"Bridges, considerable as have been their achievements, are there not"
274,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"some signs, even in their own work, and still more in the tendency"
275,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"of recent experiments, of an impulse to break away from Miltonic and"
276,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"Shakespearian usage, as though the medium of blank verse could no"
277,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"longer be profitably explored, not at least in its old traditional form?"
278,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,
279,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,Nevertheless it might plausibly be maintained that although the poets
280,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,of the future are not likely to repeat the particular successes of
281,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"Chaucer and Milton and their school, there is no reason why they should"
282,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"not exploit the medium of spoken verse in quite new ways, just as"
283,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,successfully as did their predecessors. First however it would be as
284,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,well to become somewhat clearer as to the nature of this medium of
285,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,"spoken and silently read verse, and how it differs from more primitive"
286,THE MUSES IN HEAVEN,poetry.

294,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,
295,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,
296,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"When we read Homer or Aeschylus to ourselves, we do not as a rule"
297,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"attempt to imagine what their poems must have sounded like, when they"
298,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"were recited or sung. We transpose them, as it were, into a medium more"
299,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,or less resembling that of modern poetry. Let us try to measure what
300,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"our loss must be, and what, if any, the compensations. To begin with,"
301,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"the elements of music and intonation, and also, in drama, of acting and"
302,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"dancing, have disappeared altogether. The intensity and mass of our"
303,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"emotions cannot possibly be the same as they would have been, could"
304,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,we have heard and beheld the living reality of which the text is but
305,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"a pale, colourless shadow. It is true that rhythm is still there,"
306,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"and the general proportions of the whole: but rhythm and movement,"
307,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"unembodied and uninterpreted by performers, are far more difficult"
308,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"for us to realise by the less sensuous, more purely mental process"
309,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,of reading; while in the absence of musical and histrionic contrasts
310,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"and emphasis, even the general proportions are likely to be somewhat"
311,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,obscured. It is as though we were studying a photograph or a monochrome
312,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,copy of a painted picture; or rather we might be said to experience
313,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,the same kind of difficulties as when we are contemplating colourless
314,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"fragments of Greek sculpture against the background of a museum wall,"
315,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,at a distance and in a light that were never intended for them by their
316,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"creators. How different would be our emotions, could we see the figures"
317,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,of the Olympian or Parthenon pediments placed in their right relation
318,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"to the architecture and to the landscape, unmutilated, and glowing"
319,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,with colour which harmonised with that of the temples of which they
320,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,were an organic part! It is a poor compensation that by long loving
321,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,study we may perhaps become more intimate with the indestructible
322,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"beauty of certain details, than we could ever have been, had we seen"
323,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,them less closely as elements of a complex work of art.
324,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,
325,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,In some ways our plight with regard to ancient poetry is less unhappy.
326,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"Many of our texts are unmutilated, and when we read the _Oedipus_ to"
327,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"ourselves, it should seem to us as much an organic unity as _Othello_."
328,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,There may also be a real gain in our sensitiveness to the more purely
329,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"literary qualities, such as verbal, as distinguished from musical"
330,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"colour, the suggestive values of words and combinations of words,"
331,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"their overtones, and the complicated reverberations they evoke in our"
332,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"minds. As none of the work is being done for us by performers, our"
333,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"imagination, thrown back on its own unaided resources, should be"
334,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,all the more wide awake and active. A line drawing is often a more
335,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"effective stimulus to the mind than a painting, an unaccompanied violin"
336,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"sonata than an orchestral symphony; and in the same way poetry, when"
337,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"merely read to ourselves, though it cannot so imperiously dominate our"
338,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"physical senses, may well make a subtler and profounder appeal to the"
339,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,intellectual imagination.
340,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,
341,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,All that has been said with regard to the reading of poetry that was
342,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"intended to be sung or chanted, should be even more true of modern"
343,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,verse that has been written solely in order to be spoken or read. Such
344,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,poetry is in fact composed in quite a different medium to the poetry
345,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,of Homer and Aeschylus; and I must now try to make it clear what this
346,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"medium seems to me to consist of. In order to do so, I must venture"
347,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,upon a brief excursion over the perilous quicksands of metrical theory.
348,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"To save time I shall speak dogmatically, while well aware that none of"
349,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,my assertions can at best do more than express a part of the truth.
350,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,
351,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"When we read aloud a leading article, or any other piece of utilitarian"
352,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"and unemotional prose, we are not as a rule in the least aware of the"
353,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,rhythm of the sentences. But suppose we were to read the same leading
354,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"article with a simulated mock-heroic emotion, we should then find, if"
355,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"we cared to observe, that we were now emphasising the before latent"
356,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,rhythm in two ways: we should be stressing certain syllables with
357,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,greater force; and at the same time we should be making the intervals
358,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"between these stressed syllables, not indeed rigidly equal, but far"
359,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"more nearly equal than they were, when we read the passage with the"
360,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,lack of emotion which it merited. And we shall find that the same thing
361,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,happens whenever we read prose that genuinely moves us. Emotion in
362,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"fact always tends to regularise and emphasise rhythm, even in prose."
363,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"Now the main function of verse is deliberately, by its structure,"
364,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"to regularise rhythm, and so to create emotion artificially. Let us"
365,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,take a normal English verse: “The curfew tolls the knell of parting
366,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"day.” The five stressed syllables, _cur-_, _tolls_, _knell_, _par-_,"
367,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"_day_, are felt to be equi-distant in time. No doubt they are in fact"
368,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,only approximately equi-distant. The human voice is not an instrument
369,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"like a piano or a violin, by means of which we can divide time into"
370,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"mathematically equal spaces. However, the normal bars, or feet, are"
371,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,_felt_ to be equal in time; and that is sufficient. The rhythmically
372,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,indeterminate words and phrases of everyday speech are forced into this
373,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"mould, or rather stretched upon this framework; and that process is a"
374,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"continuous series of Procrustean operations, of slight lengthenings or"
375,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"contractions, and imperceptible changes of stress and emphasis. Almost"
376,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,the most important difference between good and bad verse is that in
377,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,good verse this process of moulding and stretching words increases
378,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"their emotional expressiveness, whereas in bad verse it does not. Of"
379,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,course the versification of a good poem is never continuously regular.
380,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"Accents are dropped or displaced; unstressed syllables are left out, or"
381,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"extra syllables inserted. But we are, or should be, always conscious of"
382,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"the underlying pattern, the ideal rhythmical base."
383,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,
384,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,Such metrical irregularities are necessary not merely in order to
385,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,prevent monotony: for any writer who knows his business they are a
386,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,powerful instrument for controlling and modifying the emotional values
387,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"of language. In Milton’s line,"
388,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,
389,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"Transfix us to the bottom of this gulf,"
390,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,
391,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,there are only three stressed syllables. If these words were to occur
392,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,in a newspaper article we should probably read them so rapidly that
393,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,they would not sound like a blank verse at all. In order that they may
394,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"become a verse, we must either put artificial stresses upon _to_ and"
395,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"_of_, and read, “Trans- | fíx us | tó the | bóttom | óf this | gúlf,”"
396,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"which, though formally a blank verse, is not English; or else we must"
397,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"linger upon certain syllables, and stretch them out sufficiently to"
398,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,compensate for the absent stresses: “Trans | fíx us | to the | bóttom
399,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,| of this | gúlf.” What happens here is something of the same nature
400,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"as syncopation in music. The two pairs of syllables, _-fix us_ and"
401,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"_bottom_, are each dwelt upon and prolonged, so that they expand and"
402,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"bulge over from their own bars into the bars that follow them, and so"
403,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,push away the unemphatic syllables _to_ and _of_ from the positions
404,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"at the beginning of the bar, where a stress would normally occur. We"
405,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"are in fact compelled, if the line is to make metrical sense, to read"
406,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"the words slowly and spaciously, which produces the rhetorical and"
407,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,emotional effect that Milton intended. The following lines from Milton
408,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,are instances of the opposite process of forcing into the rhythmical
409,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,mould words which in ordinary prose speech would claim more elbow-room
410,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,than the metre allows them:
411,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,
412,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"O’er many a frozen, many a fiery alp,"
413,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"Rocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens, and shades of death."
414,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,
415,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"The natural way of spacing these words, if they were prose, would"
416,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"be: “Rócks, | cáves, | lákes, | féns, | bógs, | déns, and | shádes"
417,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,of | déath.” But the metrical framework compels us to crowd these
418,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"monosyllables together, and read them twice as rapidly as we should in"
419,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,prose. This hurry and constipation produces an effect of effort and
420,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"strain, which is just what is required. An extreme case of this power"
421,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"of metre to mould and so give life to a phrase, is the line,"
422,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,
423,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"And made him bow to the gods of his wives,"
424,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,
425,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"If this be read as a line with four stresses, thus: “And | máde him"
426,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"| bów to the | góds of his | wíves,” it is then not a Miltonic blank"
427,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"verse at all. Yet, since we cannot read it, “And | máde him | bów tó"
428,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"| thé góds | óf his | wíves,” the only thing to be done is to put a"
429,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"kind of level staccato accent on the last six syllables, thus: “And"
430,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"máde him bów tó thé góds óf hís wíves,” which spaces the words out, so"
431,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"that they sound like a blank verse, or at least do the best they can to"
432,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,sound like one. Thus not only is our ear sufficiently reminded of the
433,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"underlying metrical base, but we are obliged to give to the phrase a"
434,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"kind of fierce indignant or ironic emphasis, which again is, I think,"
435,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,exactly what Milton intended. I could multiply instances; but these
436,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"should be sufficient to illustrate the way in which verse, if it be"
437,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"well written, adds imaginative expressiveness to words, by forcing us"
438,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"to space them out and emphasise them, till they acquire new values that"
439,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,they would not have had in prose.
440,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,
441,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,Another obvious function of a constant metrical framework is that of
442,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"heightening the values of words and phrases by mere position, much as"
443,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,the structure of a cathedral may do with sculpture. Any passage of
444,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"Milton, or of Keats’ mature work, might be used to illustrate this"
445,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,principle.
446,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,
447,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,If then the main function of spoken verse be this of building a
448,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,framework upon which we may place words in significant and beautiful
449,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,relations both with each other and with the rhythmical structure
450,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"itself, and upon which we may also stretch out and contract them,"
451,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"in order to increase their emotional values, it would seem to be"
452,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,necessary that this framework should be definite and constant. And
453,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"it is this necessity that is, I think, the chief objection to some"
454,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,modern experiments in free verse. Whatever advantages there may be
455,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"in emancipation from regularity, we should not forget the price that"
456,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,has to be paid for it in the loss or diminution of this power of
457,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,moulding and vivifying language. It is true that there have been many
458,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"successful experiments in more or less free verse, from the choruses in"
459,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"_Samson Agonistes_ to, let us say, Mr. Waley’s translations of early"
460,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,Chinese poetry; but I suggest that as a general rule the success is in
461,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,proportion to the degree in which we are made aware of a fixed metrical
462,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,base underlying the irregularities. But what are we to think of this
463,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,kind of thing?
464,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,
465,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"Come, my songs, let us express our baser passions."
466,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,Let us express our envy for the man with a steady job and no worry
467,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,about the future.
468,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,
469,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"Have these words, by being divided into two lines, acquired any kind"
470,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"of value they would not have had if they had been printed as prose, in"
471,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,which case they might be enjoyed as an amusing satirical outburst? But
472,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,it would almost seem that at times free verse is no more than an excuse
473,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,for uttering futilities and ineptitudes that we should not have dared
474,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,to express in honest prose.
475,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,
476,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,There is yet another important aspect of this medium of modern verse
477,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,which we must not forget. Ancient poetry was in an obvious and literal
478,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"sense an incantation, at once charming and exciting the mind through"
479,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"the ear. Now modern poetry, though no longer chanted but spoken,"
480,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"still retains, or should retain, something of its primitive nature"
481,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"as an incantation. It is notorious that poets, when reading verse,"
482,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"generally fall into a kind of chanting delivery, which sometimes,"
483,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"owing to their lack of skill, may seem affected, and even absurd. But"
484,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,their instinct is none the less right. Poetry read to sound like
485,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,prose is intolerable. Thought is not poetic unless it be kindled into
486,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,emotion; and the natural language of emotion is different from that of
487,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"prose, the vehicle of reason. Not only is it more rhythmical, but it"
488,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"is more musical; that is to say, though the pitch is not deliberately"
489,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"regulated, as in song, there is a tendency to a level monotonous"
490,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"intonation, and changes of pitch, when they occur, are more conscious"
491,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,and more noticeable. The commonest fault of bad speakers of verse on
492,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"the stage is to emphasise individual words by raising the pitch, so"
493,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"destroying the music that is proper to verse, and incidentally the"
494,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,rhythm too.
495,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,
496,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,And here I may mention a danger to which both writers and readers of
497,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,modern verse are very liable. In order to get the full value out of
498,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"poetry (or indeed out of prose too), we ought, as Flaubert insisted, to"
499,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"read it aloud. But as we cannot always be doing that, we must, when"
500,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"reading silently to ourselves, listen with our unsensual ear to the"
501,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"same sounds and the same rhythms, moving at the same pace, as though"
502,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,we were reading aloud. Otherwise we shall not be reading poetry. It is
503,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"indeed quite possible that twenty lines of Milton, read silently thus,"
504,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,may actually take up somewhat less time than they would if they were
505,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,read aloud; but the pace ought not to _seem_ hurried: in so far as it
506,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"does, the magic of the medium will be impaired or destroyed. Moreover"
507,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"poets themselves, when, as they often do, they write more for the eye"
508,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,"and for the mind than for the ear, are not writing literature at all,"
509,THE MEDIUM OF SPOKEN VERSE,let alone poetry.

516,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE
517,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
518,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
519,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,I have now made it as clear as I am able what I believe the medium
520,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,of modern spoken verse to be; and I have tried to indicate some
521,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,of the dangers that lie in wait both for poets and their readers.
522,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,The best safeguard is that we should fully realise both what the
523,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,medium is and what it is not. All art consists in exploiting the
524,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,possibilities and limitations of a medium; and any art of which the
525,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"medium is misunderstood, and so misused, is likely to degenerate into"
526,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"gracelessness or triviality, and perish as it deserves."
527,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
528,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"Now that poetry is generally no longer performed, but read, it is"
529,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,obvious that its nature has to a certain extent grown more like that
530,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"of prose, and that there has been a corresponding increase both in"
531,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"subtlety of expression, and in the possible range of material. Let"
532,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,us take full advantage of this change: but let us also remember that
533,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"“everything is what it is, and not another thing”; that poetry still"
534,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"is, and always must be, a different art from prose; and that so long as"
535,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"it retains its integrity, it will have its own proper subject-matter,"
536,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"which though it may sometimes resemble, will never be the same as that"
537,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,of any other art.
538,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
539,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,Let us also honestly admit the truth that poetry has ceased to be a
540,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,great popular and social art. It is no longer possible for it to be
541,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,publicly recited or performed in any way. When it ventures upon the
542,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"stage, it becomes a cause either of boredom or of laughter, unless it"
543,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"be travestied until it is unrecognisable. When associated with music,"
544,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"it is absorbed in the more dominating medium. It is of course possible,"
545,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"though unlikely, that music will evolve in the direction of greater"
546,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,simplicity or that some few musicians may grow sufficiently interested
547,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"in poetry to devise a special kind of music, so tenuous and transparent"
548,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,that poetry will be able to live and breathe through it. It is also
549,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"conceivable that, although the public of the commercial theatre will"
550,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"not tolerate poetry on the stage, satisfactory amateur productions of"
551,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,verse plays may become more common. I have never heard verse spoken
552,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,on the stage more beautifully than by Ulysses and Agamemnon in the
553,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,Cambridge Marlowe Society’s _Troilus_. If such successes were to become
554,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"more frequent, we might hope in time to establish a tradition for"
555,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"performing verse plays, and to create a fit audience for them, which"
556,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,would encourage poets to take poetical drama seriously. But if that is
557,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"to happen, then modern experiments will have to be risked, and produced"
558,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,as carefully and as frequently as classical revivals are now.
559,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
560,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,But though in this direction we may see a kind of dawning hope for
561,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"poetical drama, yet I fear it is no more than a dubious glimmering."
562,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,Poetry will still have to be written in the main for readers. And
563,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"if poets are to continue to find readers, in spite of the growing"
564,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"competition of the more popular arts of music, the prose drama, the"
565,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"cinema, and the novel, they will have, I fancy, to take thought how"
566,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"they may put away childish things, and become, not perhaps more"
567,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"serious, but more rational, more daring, in fact more interesting. The"
568,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,material for poetry is the whole realm of the sensuous and intellectual
569,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"imagination, and that is infinite. At present poets seem to be"
570,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,somewhat timid and unenterprising explorers. And I would suggest that
571,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,experiments and innovations in technique are likely to be the most
572,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,hopeful means of extending the range of expression and of discovering
573,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,new material. In every art changes and developments of the medium
574,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,require and call forth the invention of appropriate subject-matter; and
575,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,the greatest art has always been produced where inspiration has been
576,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"refreshed and quickened by technical changes, which have made possible"
577,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,the exploitation of unfamiliar themes. It would be rash to foretell
578,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,with any confidence the directions in which poetical technique will
579,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"develop in the future. The poets themselves will go their own ways, for"
580,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,better or for worse. But I may perhaps venture to indicate what seem to
581,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,me the most natural and profitable lines of development.
582,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
583,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,Whatever may be our theory as to the true æsthetic and emotional
584,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"function of metre, the conscious governing principle, according"
585,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,to which English verse has been written from the time of Chaucer
586,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"until recent years, has been that of syllable-counting. Wherever a"
587,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"decasyllabic line contained more than ten syllables, elision, or the"
588,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"fiction of elision, was assumed as the explanation. Milton indeed"
589,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"formulated for himself certain definite rules, which he observed"
590,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"with great strictness, at least in _Paradise Lost._ But already in"
591,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,Shakespeare we may perceive a tendency to determine rhythm by stress
592,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,rather than by the number of syllables; and during the last hundred
593,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,years we find stress becoming more and more the dominant principle of
594,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,English prosody. When Mr. Abercrombie writes:
595,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
596,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,And I will show
597,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"This mask the devil wears, this old shipman,"
598,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,A thing to make his proud heart of evil
599,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,Writhe like a trodden snake;
600,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
601,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,or when Mr. Bottomley writes:
602,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
603,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,Have I broken the bird’s wings to catch the bird?
604,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,Have I shattered the door of her mind to enter there?
605,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
606,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,they are following the same principle that allowed Shakespeare to say:
607,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
608,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,Dearly my delicate Ariel. Let us approach ...
609,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
610,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,or again:
611,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
612,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps."
613,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
614,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,They have in fact adopted an entirely different metrical system not
615,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"only from Milton’s, but from such poets as Donne, who when he wrote:"
616,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
617,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"Blasted with sighs, and surrounded with tears,"
618,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
619,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,did so in the confidence that his readers would be instinctively
620,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"conscious of the number of the syllables, and so would not be"
621,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,disconcerted by the irregular disposition of the stresses.
622,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
623,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"These two systems of syllabic and stress prosody, though descended from"
624,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"the same parent, the rhymed couplet of Chaucer, have now grown to be"
625,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"very different from each other. I would suggest that, just as stress"
626,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,prosody had its origin in Shakespeare’s need for increased energy and
627,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"emphasis in verse that was intended to be declaimed on the stage, so it"
628,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,may still be found to be the more expressive instrument for dramatic
629,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"poetry, or for lyrics that require a free rhythmical structure; whereas"
630,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"syllabic prosody, of which Milton was the supreme master, is more"
631,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"suitable for undramatic verse of a deliberate and even movement, or for"
632,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"meditative lyrical poetry, like that of Donne and Keats. In a recently"
633,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"published poem, written in alexandrines, Mr. Bridges has carried the"
634,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"syllabic principle to its logical conclusion, and relying upon the"
635,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"rigid observance of his rule of twelve syllables to each line, has"
636,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,ventured upon a far more extensive use of difficult displacements of
637,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"accent than even Milton thought possible. It may be that, as often"
638,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"happens with experimental artists, Mr. Bridges has demanded more effort"
639,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"from some of his readers than they will be able to give. But if so, it"
640,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"is to be hoped that he will write more poetry on the same method, so"
641,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,that the counting of syllables may become as natural and instinctive
642,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,a process with us as it evidently is with him. He has already had the
643,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,courage to explore the possibilities of English quantitative verse;
644,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,yet though some of the poetry he wrote according to that system was
645,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"of remarkable beauty, the experiment was perhaps too alien to the"
646,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,rhythmical genius of our language to be altogether satisfactory. But
647,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"his new syllabic experiment, being no mere leap in the dark, but a"
648,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,natural development of the medium we have inherited from Chaucer and
649,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"Milton, deserves our welcome, and is all the more likely to achieve"
650,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,lasting success.
651,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
652,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"In discussing the structure of English metre, I have taken my examples"
653,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"from blank verse, because that is the oldest and most highly elaborated"
654,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,of our verse-forms. But besides blank verse there are three other
655,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"fundamental rhythms, each with a history and future possibilities of"
656,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"its own. If a musical analogy be permissible, rhythms of the blank"
657,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"verse kind (with or without rime, and whatever may be the number of"
658,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,feet to the line) may be said to be in duple time. But there is another
659,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"rhythmical variety, which is sometimes not easy to distinguish from"
660,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"duple time, yet is essentially different."
661,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
662,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,And mony was the feather bed
663,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,That flatter’d on the faem;
664,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,And mony was the gude lord’s son
665,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,That never mair came hame.
666,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
667,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"This seven-stressed couplet, in which so many of our ballads are"
668,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"written, may be said to be in common time. The first, third, fifth and"
669,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,seventh stresses are generally stronger than the three intervening
670,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"stresses, thus producing a kind of rhythmical undulation, which gives"
671,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,the line swiftness and lightness. The Elizabethans used this metre
672,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,frequently in the form of rimed couplets. Chapman’s translation of the
673,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"_Iliad_, for example, is written in it. Blake in his prophetic books"
674,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"was the first, so far as I know, to dispense with rime, and to give"
675,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"the line variety by frequently changing the position of the cæsura,"
676,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,which normally follows the fourth stress. The following lines are from
677,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,the _Book of Thel_.
678,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
679,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,The daughters of the Seraphim led round their sunny flocks--
680,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"All but the youngest: she in paleness sought the secret air,"
681,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,To fade away like morning beauty from her mortal day.
682,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"Down by the river of Adona her soft voice is heard,"
683,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,And thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning dew:--
684,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,“O life of this our spring! why fades the lotus of the water?
685,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"Why fade these children of the spring, born but to smile and fall?"
686,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"Ah! Thel is like a watery bow, and like a parting cloud;"
687,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,Like a reflection in a glass; like shadows in the water;
688,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"Like dreams of infants, like a smile upon an infant’s face;"
689,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,Like the dove’s voice; like transient day; like music in the air.”
690,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
691,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"Shelley uses this metre lyrically in two of his most beautiful poems,"
692,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"taking the liberty of omitting the minor even stresses, and the light"
693,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"syllables that precede them, whenever it suits his purpose."
694,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
695,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,Awáy! The móor is dárk beneath the moón.
696,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,Rápid clouds have drúnk the lást pale beams of éven:
697,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"Awáy! the gathering wínds will cáll the darkness sóon,"
698,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,And profóundest midnight shróud the seréne lights of héaven.
699,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
700,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,He concludes with the completely filled-out structure:
701,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
702,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"Thy remémbrance, and repéntance, and deep músings are not frée"
703,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,From the músic of two vóices and the light of one sweet smíle.
704,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
705,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,The lines in his _Prometheus_ beginning:
706,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
707,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"Ah Síster, Desolátion is a délicate thing,"
708,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
709,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"are also written in this metre, which moreover is sufficiently Protean"
710,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"to form the basis of several of Gilbert’s most attractive songs, such"
711,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"as, “If you’re anxious for to shine in the high æsthetic line as a"
712,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,man of culture rare.” There is no reason why this metre should not be
713,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"developed into a very expressive and subtle instrument, especially if"
714,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,Blake’s experiment be taken as a starting point. Though it may not
715,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"have the grandeur of Milton’s blank verse, it has more rapidity and"
716,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"lightness, and is not without a beauty and dignity of its own."
717,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
718,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"Triple time was seldom employed by the Elizabethans, except in lyrics"
719,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,such as Shakespeare’s:
720,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
721,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"Merrily, merrily shall I live now"
722,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.
723,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
724,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"The eighteenth century found it an effective comedic rhythm, as in"
725,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,Goldsmith’s:
726,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
727,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"When they talked of their Raphaels, Correggios and stuff,"
728,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,He shifted his trumpet and only took snuff.
729,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
730,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"But it was Shelley who first successfully slowed down triple time, and"
731,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"gave it dignity and variety, as in his _Sensitive Plant_:"
732,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
733,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"And the jessamine faint, and the sweet tuberose,"
734,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,The sweetest flower for scent that blows;
735,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,And all rare blossoms from every clime
736,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,Grew in that garden in perfect prime.
737,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
738,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"This rhythm has now become, in various forms and disguises, one of"
739,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"our commonest lyrical metres, easily modulating into duple time, and"
740,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,adaptable to lines of various lengths.
741,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
742,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"There is also another slower triple time, quite different to the usual"
743,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"form. Byron used it, probably without knowing what he was doing,"
744,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"in several of his lyrics, such as the Song of the Third Spirit in"
745,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"_Manfred_, and “There be none of Beauty’s daughters”: but the only"
746,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"instance I know where it has been consciously and deliberately used,"
747,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,is Professor Murray’s translation of an _Ionic a minore_ ode in the
748,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,_Hippolytus_:
749,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
750,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"Could I take me to some cavern for mine hiding,"
751,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,In the hill-tops where the Sun scarce hath trod.
752,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
753,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,It is unlikely that this difficult rhythm will ever become common; but
754,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"in lyric poetry, by way of occasional contrast, very beautiful effects"
755,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,might well be obtained by it.
756,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
757,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"So far as I can see, these four are the only fundamental rhythms"
758,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"in English poetry. Their true nature, their various disguises, and"
759,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"their difference and relationship with one another, are not always"
760,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"sufficiently understood, and the result has frequently been confused"
761,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"and clumsy workmanship, and a failure to exploit their latent"
762,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,possibilities to the full.
763,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,
764,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,There is one further aspect of the poetic craft which I must now
765,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"mention. The Greek lyrical poets, whose metre was quantitative, and"
766,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"was emphasised by music and dancing movements, were able to build"
767,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,up far more elaborately organised rhythmical structures than we are
768,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"accustomed to, with our simpler lyrical forms. Structure, with us, is"
769,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"generally delineated and emphasised by rime, rather than by internal"
770,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,variations and contrasts of rhythm. Even in the unrimed choruses of
771,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,_Samson Agonistes_ the rhythm is far more uniform than in the simplest
772,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,Greek lyrical poems. I do not suggest that it would be possible or
773,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,desirable artificially to change the nature of English poetical rhythm
774,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"from an accentual to a quantitative basis, as Ennius did with Latin"
775,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,prosody. But although no doubt purely quantitative English verse will
776,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"always remain somewhat of an exotic curiosity, I feel sure that if more"
777,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"conscious attention were paid to the quantity of English syllables,"
778,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"not only would our normal verse-forms, such as blank verse, gain in"
779,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"subtlety and expressive force, but all sorts of new possibilities of"
780,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,lyrical structure could be discovered and explored. Rime need not
781,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,necessarily be dispensed with; but it would no longer be the only
782,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,effective instrument for binding together a complicated lyrical stanza.
783,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,Stress would still indicate and govern internal rhythm; but careful
784,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,attention to the length and shortness of syllables would make it
785,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,possible to build up far more elaborate and varied metrical structures
786,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,than have hitherto been attempted. The result might be a verse that was
787,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"genuinely free, yet did not degenerate into prose, based upon irregular"
788,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"but easily comprehensible metrical patterns, that could mould and"
789,THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUE,"dominate language as effectively as the older, more rigid verse-forms."

798,POETIC MATERIAL,
799,POETIC MATERIAL,"Difficult as it must be to foresee the evolution of technical methods,"
800,POETIC MATERIAL,it would be still more hazardous to attempt any prediction as to the
801,POETIC MATERIAL,"new subject-matter which poets will have to discover, if their art is"
802,POETIC MATERIAL,to continue as a living growth. The mind of even the most detached
803,POETIC MATERIAL,"artist is a part of the world into which he was born, and his matter"
804,POETIC MATERIAL,must to a large extent be a reflection of his environment. But the
805,POETIC MATERIAL,material and spiritual world changes far more swiftly than the language
806,POETIC MATERIAL,and the rhythmical artifices which constitute the poetic medium.
807,POETIC MATERIAL,"And so, although I have suggested elsewhere that technique is the"
808,POETIC MATERIAL,"mistress of invention, and that changes in the medium make possible"
809,POETIC MATERIAL,"the discovery of new themes, yet an opposite theory might as easily"
810,POETIC MATERIAL,"be maintained, with perhaps equal truth, that social and intellectual"
811,POETIC MATERIAL,"changes create demands, in satisfying which an intelligent artist will"
812,POETIC MATERIAL,"find his most genial inspiration, and will modify his technique until"
813,POETIC MATERIAL,it becomes a fit instrument for expressing his new material. But though
814,POETIC MATERIAL,"for these reasons it would be unwise to indulge in prophecy, we may at"
815,POETIC MATERIAL,least take a survey of the main possibilities.
816,POETIC MATERIAL,
817,POETIC MATERIAL,"To begin with, the innumerable and infinite output of personal lyrics,"
818,POETIC MATERIAL,"good, bad and indifferent, is certain to continue, so long as human"
819,POETIC MATERIAL,"beings are subject to passions and sentimentalities, and can enjoy"
820,POETIC MATERIAL,"the varying moods of nature, and the pleasures of poetic pastiche."
821,POETIC MATERIAL,"However capriciously the winds of literary fashion may blow, the"
822,POETIC MATERIAL,"countless flock of minor lyricists will always be with us, while the"
823,POETIC MATERIAL,truly great will be few and far between. One danger indeed we have
824,POETIC MATERIAL,little reason to fear. I mean the sterilising tyranny of some dominant
825,POETIC MATERIAL,"lyrical form, such as the Greek elegiac couplet, or the late-classical"
826,POETIC MATERIAL,"Chinese stanza. Our poetry is already so abundantly rich in types, and"
827,POETIC MATERIAL,"so fertile in breeding new varieties, that neither the spirit of a new"
828,POETIC MATERIAL,"Age, nor genius however individual need be at a loss for appropriate"
829,POETIC MATERIAL,forms of lyrical self-expression. A twentieth-century Catullus or Heine
830,POETIC MATERIAL,would have no cause for complaint if he were to be born an Englishman.
831,POETIC MATERIAL,
832,POETIC MATERIAL,"It is with regard to lyrics on a larger, more elaborate scale, that"
833,POETIC MATERIAL,English poets have hitherto shown least ambition and enterprise. The
834,POETIC MATERIAL,Pindarics of Gray are a poor substitute for Pindar; while the _Odes_ of
835,POETIC MATERIAL,Keats and Matthew Arnold’s _Thyrsis_ and _Scholar-Gipsy_ are elegiac
836,POETIC MATERIAL,"rather than lyrical in mood and form. Shelley and Goethe, and at times"
837,POETIC MATERIAL,"Swinburne, have shown themselves to be more truly the successors of"
838,POETIC MATERIAL,"the greater Greek lyric poets; and if they be rightly understood, their"
839,POETIC MATERIAL,example may yet bear fruit for our delight of altogether unimaginable
840,POETIC MATERIAL,quality. But the tendency of the moment seems to be towards poems on
841,POETIC MATERIAL,"a small scale, of a somewhat anæmic delicacy, or else of an artful"
842,POETIC MATERIAL,"and piquant quaintness, rather than towards the sustained movement,"
843,POETIC MATERIAL,"and elaborate yet highly organised form, which is necessary for the"
844,POETIC MATERIAL,greatest lyrical poetry.
845,POETIC MATERIAL,
846,POETIC MATERIAL,"Another province of literature, which we have seldom as yet attempted"
847,POETIC MATERIAL,"to make our own, is that of comic poetry. We have indeed had many and"
848,POETIC MATERIAL,"various comic writers of first-rate quality; but although, when they"
849,POETIC MATERIAL,"were so minded, Chaucer and Shakespeare and Byron could show themselves"
850,POETIC MATERIAL,"to be masters of comedy in verse, we have as yet had no Aristophanes,"
851,POETIC MATERIAL,but have been obliged to content ourselves with the charming
852,POETIC MATERIAL,"trivialities and vulgarities of a Gilbert. If only Ben Jonson, in"
853,POETIC MATERIAL,"addition to stage-craft, Gargantuan comic energy and Titanic eloquence,"
854,POETIC MATERIAL,"had been gifted with a particle of that fiery celestial ether, by"
855,POETIC MATERIAL,"which alone mortal art can become divine, then indeed perhaps...."
856,POETIC MATERIAL,"But of what use are regrets? The future, not the past, is here our"
857,POETIC MATERIAL,concern. And what a future might there not be for the comic genius
858,POETIC MATERIAL,"who should be so fortunately inspired as to take the popular Farce,"
859,POETIC MATERIAL,"or even the theatrical Revue, and by giving it the life and the wings"
860,POETIC MATERIAL,"of poetry, so transform it from a poor ephemeral stage-hobby-horse"
861,POETIC MATERIAL,"into an immortal cloud-cruising Pegasus, or at least a serviceable"
862,POETIC MATERIAL,"Hippogryph! Thus sublimely mounted, what regions of the earth and sky"
863,POETIC MATERIAL,might not such a Bellerophon explore? What monsters and Chimæras might
864,POETIC MATERIAL,he not torment and slay with the shafts of his lyrical ridicule? All
865,POETIC MATERIAL,"that men and women say or think or do, would lie ready as fuel for his"
866,POETIC MATERIAL,"imagination to kindle at will, all our follies and fashions, vices and"
867,POETIC MATERIAL,"virtues, stupidities, cruelties, noble extravagances, religious and"
868,POETIC MATERIAL,metaphysical dreams. If Socrates could afford to be a good-naturedly
869,POETIC MATERIAL,"amused spectator of the _Clouds_, so might Freud of some _Comedy of"
870,POETIC MATERIAL,"Dreams_ by our modern Aristophanes: and if he could not, why, so much"
871,POETIC MATERIAL,the worse for him and his speculations. How wholesome too for our
872,POETIC MATERIAL,"prominent statesmen and demagogues!--But alas, I am forgetting our"
873,POETIC MATERIAL,Lord Chamberlain. We are not yet sufficiently enlightened to tolerate
874,POETIC MATERIAL,"political caricature and Rabelaisian ribaldry upon our stage, and"
875,POETIC MATERIAL,"an English _Knights_ or _Lysistrata_ must remain, I fear, for the"
876,POETIC MATERIAL,"present a poet’s dream. Nevertheless, under a reasonably intelligent"
877,POETIC MATERIAL,"censorship, what Rabelais was for his age, an emancipated imaginative"
878,POETIC MATERIAL,"comedy might well be for our own, except that, whereas the Gallic"
879,POETIC MATERIAL,genius has always expressed itself most naturally and completely in
880,POETIC MATERIAL,"prose, ours would expand more congenially into poetry, which, for all"
881,POETIC MATERIAL,"its apparent limitations, should be, at its best, the more universal"
882,POETIC MATERIAL,"interpreter of the spirit of man, whether on the plane of tragedy or of"
883,POETIC MATERIAL,comedy.
884,POETIC MATERIAL,
885,POETIC MATERIAL,There is good reason for hoping that the problem of an adequate
886,POETIC MATERIAL,stage-performance of imaginative comedy would be less difficult to
887,POETIC MATERIAL,solve than it seems to be in the case of serious poetic drama. Actors
888,POETIC MATERIAL,are always more ready to understand and do justice to plays that are
889,POETIC MATERIAL,good fun as well as good literature. Mr. Bernard Shaw and Gilbert and
890,POETIC MATERIAL,Sullivan are apt to meet with better treatment at the hands of our
891,POETIC MATERIAL,producers and performers than Ibsen or Wagner. All the same even poetic
892,POETIC MATERIAL,tragedy should not be too lightly despaired of. If great plays can be
893,POETIC MATERIAL,"written, someone sooner or later is likely to have the ambition and the"
894,POETIC MATERIAL,intelligence to produce them worthily. Something of the kind seems to
895,POETIC MATERIAL,"have happened at Glasgow, in the case of Mr. Gordon Bottomley’s verse"
896,POETIC MATERIAL,"plays. Let us hope, however cautiously, that what Scotland does to-day,"
897,POETIC MATERIAL,England may at least begin to think of doing to-morrow. Meantime
898,POETIC MATERIAL,there is one wholesome lesson that poets may learn from the undoubted
899,POETIC MATERIAL,literary success of Mr. Bottomley’s _Gruach_ and _Lear’s Wife_. It is
900,POETIC MATERIAL,continually being dinned into their ears by critics who should know
901,POETIC MATERIAL,"better, that the time is now gone by when poets might borrow their"
902,POETIC MATERIAL,material from a remote or legendary past; that a twentieth-century
903,POETIC MATERIAL,dramatist must deal only in twentieth-century themes if he hopes to
904,POETIC MATERIAL,"reach the hearts of twentieth-century men and women, or to win the"
905,POETIC MATERIAL,good graces of Georgian reviewers. And yet it is unquestionably true
906,POETIC MATERIAL,"that in every period when poetic tragedy has flourished, mythical,"
907,POETIC MATERIAL,"legendary and historical subjects have been the rule, and contemporary"
908,POETIC MATERIAL,"themes the rare exceptions. Oedipus, Agamemnon and Pentheus were not"
909,POETIC MATERIAL,"fifth-century Athenians any more than Hamlet, Lear and Antony were"
910,POETIC MATERIAL,"Elizabethans, or Andromaque and Phèdre _Parisiennes_ of the _grand"
911,POETIC MATERIAL,"siècle_. The artistic success of the _Persae_, _Othello_ and _Bajazet_"
912,POETIC MATERIAL,merely make this determined preference for archaic subject-matter seem
913,POETIC MATERIAL,the more remarkable. And yet none of these writers were mere literary
914,POETIC MATERIAL,"antiquarians, but true children of their own age, to whose dramas we"
915,POETIC MATERIAL,"now look first, if we wish to understand the mentality and the moral"
916,POETIC MATERIAL,"standards of the populace that applauded them. Even Goethe, in the"
917,POETIC MATERIAL,work that perhaps more than any other represents the complexity of
918,POETIC MATERIAL,"modern ideas and aspirations, went back to a myth that was then two"
919,POETIC MATERIAL,"hundred years old. It would seem as though the poetic imagination, when"
920,POETIC MATERIAL,"it sets itself the most arduous of its tasks, that of alembicating"
921,POETIC MATERIAL,"tragic beauty from human misery and passion, welcomes the limitation"
922,POETIC MATERIAL,"of choice, the simplicity of atmosphere, the freedom from distracting"
923,POETIC MATERIAL,"contemporary preoccupations, which a remote theme brings with it. None"
924,POETIC MATERIAL,"the less Ibsen’s _Brandt_ and _Peer Gynt_ show how a modern, though"
925,POETIC MATERIAL,"scarcely a familiar world, may be made the background of true poetic"
926,POETIC MATERIAL,tragedy; although in _Peer Gynt_ the almost continued presence of the
927,POETIC MATERIAL,"Comedic Muse, with her incurable modernity, tempers the difficulty of"
928,POETIC MATERIAL,"the problem. Thus, though it would be unreasonable to maintain that the"
929,POETIC MATERIAL,Tragic Muse must be unable to live and breathe in the smoky atmosphere
930,POETIC MATERIAL,"of our present-day world, it would be still more absurd to prohibit her"
931,POETIC MATERIAL,escape into the purer clime of a legendary or historical past.
932,POETIC MATERIAL,
933,POETIC MATERIAL,"The case of narrative poetry is somewhat similar, yet with important"
934,POETIC MATERIAL,differences. It is true that the Homeric heroes and the society in
935,POETIC MATERIAL,which they lived had long ceased to exist when the _Iliad_ and the
936,POETIC MATERIAL,"_Odyssey_ were composed, and that most of the great epic and narrative"
937,POETIC MATERIAL,"writers, Virgil, Ariosto, Milton and Marlowe, preferred mythical or"
938,POETIC MATERIAL,purely fantastic settings for their stories. Yet such a limitation
939,POETIC MATERIAL,would seem to be hardly so natural to narrative as to tragic poetry.
940,POETIC MATERIAL,"For the quality of narrative being less intense and passionate, and"
941,POETIC MATERIAL,"its unity more loose, it is able to indulge copiously in decoration,"
942,POETIC MATERIAL,"description and digression, and so should be able to deal all the more"
943,POETIC MATERIAL,"effectively with the variegated modern scene. And yet, except for two"
944,POETIC MATERIAL,"sombre short stories in blank verse by Wordsworth, and Byron’s _Don"
945,POETIC MATERIAL,"Juan_, there has scarcely been any narrative, dealing with modern life"
946,POETIC MATERIAL,"and of first-rate poetical quality, since Chaucer’s _Canterbury Tales_."
947,POETIC MATERIAL,This is perhaps because poets have not sufficiently realised that the
948,POETIC MATERIAL,telling of a story in verse instead of prose can only be justified
949,POETIC MATERIAL,when the sensuous and decorative beauty of the medium is continually
950,POETIC MATERIAL,maintained at the highest pitch. For whereas in the intense and
951,POETIC MATERIAL,tragic moments of drama exquisiteness and richness of texture may be
952,POETIC MATERIAL,"unnecessary, or at times even a positive nuisance, bald and graceless"
953,POETIC MATERIAL,verse narrative is always insupportable. Byron indeed atoned for much
954,POETIC MATERIAL,artistic unscrupulousness and slovenly workmanship by his unfailing
955,POETIC MATERIAL,energy and wit. But poets will have to take to heart the lesson of
956,POETIC MATERIAL,"Chaucer’s scrupulous attention to beauty of texture, if they are to"
957,POETIC MATERIAL,hold their own in rivalry with prose fiction. They will have also to
958,POETIC MATERIAL,be aware of the dangers of a too exclusive interest in analytical
959,POETIC MATERIAL,"psychology. Narrative, when it ceases to narrate, very easily becomes"
960,POETIC MATERIAL,a bore. Such writers as Proust and Henry James may have been able
961,POETIC MATERIAL,"successfully to dispense with many of the functions of story-telling,"
962,POETIC MATERIAL,by laboriously evolving a peculiar prose instrument of their own for
963,POETIC MATERIAL,the expression of psychological subtleties. But it is doubtful whether
964,POETIC MATERIAL,"anything of the kind would be possible in verse, or, if possible,"
965,POETIC MATERIAL,"whether it would be readable. Yet for the direct presentation, serious"
966,POETIC MATERIAL,"or humoristic, of character, mood and emotion, verse in the hands of a"
967,POETIC MATERIAL,master will always remain an instrument of supreme power.
968,POETIC MATERIAL,
969,POETIC MATERIAL,"There are certain other kinds of poetry, more or less akin to"
970,POETIC MATERIAL,"narrative, for which an interesting future may be predicted. The"
971,POETIC MATERIAL,Victorians seem to have had a special predilection for the Dramatic
972,POETIC MATERIAL,"Monologue, perhaps because they unconsciously felt their inability to"
973,POETIC MATERIAL,cope with the problems of drama. _Caliban upon Setebos_ and _The Bishop
974,POETIC MATERIAL,orders his Tomb in St. Praxed’s Church_ are notable successes; but
975,POETIC MATERIAL,several of Browning’s experiments should be a warning of the danger of
976,POETIC MATERIAL,lengthiness and over-elaboration in a form that allows of very little
977,POETIC MATERIAL,narrative interest or dramatic contrast. Great and sustained beauty of
978,POETIC MATERIAL,language can alone justify a long poem of such a kind; and it is just
979,POETIC MATERIAL,in this respect that Browning was most deficient.
980,POETIC MATERIAL,
981,POETIC MATERIAL,Another attractive sub-species of narrative poetry is the Dramatic
982,POETIC MATERIAL,"Dialogue or Interlude, which has lately been successfully revived"
983,POETIC MATERIAL,by Mr. Sturge Moore and Mr. Abercrombie. The great master of this
984,POETIC MATERIAL,"form, as also of the Monologue, is Theocritus, whose _Syracusan"
985,POETIC MATERIAL,"Women_, _Kyniska_, _Thyrsis_, and _Simaitha_ will always remain as"
986,POETIC MATERIAL,a challenging inspiration to succeeding ages. The great range of
987,POETIC MATERIAL,"his material within the narrow limits of his surviving work, and"
988,POETIC MATERIAL,"his marvellous blend of naturalism and poetry, should be peculiarly"
989,POETIC MATERIAL,"suggestive to a generation like our own, with its eagerness to find new"
990,POETIC MATERIAL,"paths, or rediscover old ones, to poetic freedom."
991,POETIC MATERIAL,
992,POETIC MATERIAL,It would be presumptuous in one who is not himself a philosopher to
993,POETIC MATERIAL,speak with assurance about philosophic poetry: yet I shall venture upon
994,POETIC MATERIAL,some obvious reflections. Few would dispute that there has been only
995,POETIC MATERIAL,"one specifically philosophical work which is also a great poem, the"
996,POETIC MATERIAL,"_De Rerum Natura_ of Lucretius. But those of us who love it best will,"
997,POETIC MATERIAL,"if we are candid, admit that it contains vast tracts of scientific"
998,POETIC MATERIAL,"and metaphysical discussion, which even fervid and eloquent genius"
999,POETIC MATERIAL,has not wholly succeeded in clothing with the vesture of poetry. It
1000,POETIC MATERIAL,"is true that, for those few who have the courage and wisdom to read"
1001,POETIC MATERIAL,"them, these sections should have a very high value as parts of a"
1002,POETIC MATERIAL,sublime imaginative vision of the universe; and they also contain
1003,POETIC MATERIAL,many scattered episodes of divine poetic loveliness. But the claim
1004,POETIC MATERIAL,of Lucretius to rank among the world’s greatest writers will always
1005,POETIC MATERIAL,"rest upon those sections, such as the endings of his third, fourth"
1006,POETIC MATERIAL,"and fifth books, where the material is already in its essence poetic,"
1007,POETIC MATERIAL,"and gives scope to his supreme gift for sensuous description, or for"
1008,POETIC MATERIAL,passionate ethical discourse. It is to be feared that if a poet of
1009,POETIC MATERIAL,"equal genius with Lucretius were to take modern psychology, the physics"
1010,POETIC MATERIAL,"of Einstein, or the philosophy of Mr. Russell as his subject-matter,"
1011,POETIC MATERIAL,with the intention of seriously expounding and not of merely poetising
1012,POETIC MATERIAL,"them, he would be unable to avoid similar desert tracts of unpoetical"
1013,POETIC MATERIAL,reasoning. But it is a narrow view which can deny that verse should
1014,POETIC MATERIAL,"ever be employed, unless the result be poetry. If an artist in language"
1015,POETIC MATERIAL,is able to set forth philosophic matter that is of great intrinsic
1016,POETIC MATERIAL,interest more luminously and attractively in verse than could be done
1017,POETIC MATERIAL,in prose (which is precisely what Lucretius did with the crabbed
1018,POETIC MATERIAL,"sentences of Epicurus), let us not grudge him the praise and gratitude"
1019,POETIC MATERIAL,"that are his due. However, it seems unlikely that scientific philosophy"
1020,POETIC MATERIAL,will ever again inspire an expository treatise such as the _De Rerum
1021,POETIC MATERIAL,Natura_. It might indeed enter as an all-pervading influence into some
1022,POETIC MATERIAL,"comprehensive epic design, just as religion and scholastic philosophy"
1023,POETIC MATERIAL,"pervade the _Divina Commedia_. What is certain is that, as there have"
1024,POETIC MATERIAL,"always been, so there always will be philosophically minded poets, and"
1025,POETIC MATERIAL,that they will discover for themselves what forms serve their purpose
1026,POETIC MATERIAL,best.
1027,POETIC MATERIAL,
1028,POETIC MATERIAL,"The treatise, as a poetic form, would seem to be more suitable for"
1029,POETIC MATERIAL,"subjects that are neither strictly philosophic, nor scientific. Yet"
1030,POETIC MATERIAL,"though we have had our _Seasons_, _Night Thoughts_, and _Sofas_ in"
1031,POETIC MATERIAL,"plenty, Virgil’s _Georgics_ remain still unrivalled. Why should not"
1032,POETIC MATERIAL,an ingenious and erudite poet take some such pregnant subject as
1033,POETIC MATERIAL,"Architecture, the Garden, or the Evolution of Religion, or if he have"
1034,POETIC MATERIAL,"the knowledge and the boldness, Machinery, Medicine or Economics, and"
1035,POETIC MATERIAL,"dispute Virgil’s supremacy in this field, as Virgil once did Hesiod’s?"
1036,POETIC MATERIAL,How fascinating would he not find the problem of wedding didactic
1037,POETIC MATERIAL,and historical exposition to perfect loveliness of texture? What
1038,POETIC MATERIAL,opportunities for description and reflection? And with what entrancing
1039,POETIC MATERIAL,"episodes, serious or playful, might he not delight our fancy?"
1040,POETIC MATERIAL,
1041,POETIC MATERIAL,"Not the least noble, nor the least exacting of mistresses, is the"
1042,POETIC MATERIAL,"Muse of Satire. “_Facit indignatio versum_,” said Juvenal. But alas,"
1043,POETIC MATERIAL,"how fumbling a designer, how banal a metrician, how unscrupulous and"
1044,POETIC MATERIAL,inartistic a poetaster has Indignation generally proved herself to be.
1045,POETIC MATERIAL,"Few satires survive the ephemeral social follies that provoked them,"
1046,POETIC MATERIAL,"because, being by nature parasites, when that which supported their"
1047,POETIC MATERIAL,"growth decays and perishes, they too must perish, unless indeed they"
1048,POETIC MATERIAL,are rooted deeply in the unchanging soil of imagination and poetry.
1049,POETIC MATERIAL,Truly great satire will always be very rare. It is still possible
1050,POETIC MATERIAL,"to read with delight Byron’s _Vision of Judgment_, and portions of"
1051,POETIC MATERIAL,his _Age of Bronze_; and there are passages in Pope and Dryden that
1052,POETIC MATERIAL,fully deserve their reputation. But it is perhaps only in parts of the
1053,POETIC MATERIAL,"_Divina Commedia_, and in the last three hundred lines of the fourth"
1054,POETIC MATERIAL,"book of Lucretius, and occasionally in Leopardi, that satire may be"
1055,POETIC MATERIAL,found mingled as the dominating element in poetry of the highest order.
1056,POETIC MATERIAL,"Its taste even there is bitter, but with the divine bitterness of"
1057,POETIC MATERIAL,passion and sincerity.
1058,POETIC MATERIAL,
1059,POETIC MATERIAL,"In the enchanted kingdom of fantasy and the mock-heroic, Pope’s _Rape"
1060,POETIC MATERIAL,of the Lock_ and Lear’s poems still reign supreme. It is perhaps
1061,POETIC MATERIAL,"because they are ostensibly written for the delight of children, that"
1062,POETIC MATERIAL,"_The Owl and the Pussycat_, _The Dong_, and the _Quangle-Wangle_"
1063,POETIC MATERIAL,"have never, so far as I know, found their way into serious adult"
1064,POETIC MATERIAL,anthologies. Yet if we are really sincere in our quest for lyrical
1065,POETIC MATERIAL,"beauty, verbal euphony and metrical invention, we should not have"
1066,POETIC MATERIAL,tolerated without protest the absence of these poems from the _Oxford
1067,POETIC MATERIAL,"Book of Verse_, where they would more than hold their own in the"
1068,POETIC MATERIAL,"company of _Annabel Lee_, _The Lady of Shalott_, and _The Blessed"
1069,POETIC MATERIAL,Damozel_.

1079,MISCELLANEOUS,The main trouble with all attempts at literary classification is that
1080,MISCELLANEOUS,they are bound to exclude many intermediate types. Much of the most
1081,MISCELLANEOUS,"memorable English poetry is neither in a strict sense lyrical, nor"
1082,MISCELLANEOUS,"philosophic, nor anything else than beautiful and shapely verse. No"
1083,MISCELLANEOUS,"other literature is so rich as ours in quasi-lyrical poetry, such as"
1084,MISCELLANEOUS,"the sonnets of Shakespeare and Wordsworth, Gray’s _Elegy_ and Keats’"
1085,MISCELLANEOUS,_Odes_. Future writers will doubtless invent other similar forms for
1086,MISCELLANEOUS,their new purposes; but it would be a disastrous error to suppose
1087,MISCELLANEOUS,"that, because an art-form has once become classical, it therefore can"
1088,MISCELLANEOUS,"no longer be used, except for academic pastiche. No form is ever"
1089,MISCELLANEOUS,superannuated if it be the best possible vehicle for expressing a new
1090,MISCELLANEOUS,artistic idea. A poet need be no more afraid of using the Shakespearian
1091,MISCELLANEOUS,"or Petrarchian sonnet, than a musician need be ashamed of composing"
1092,MISCELLANEOUS,"a classical fugue, provided his inspiration be genuine; and its"
1093,MISCELLANEOUS,genuineness will not be obscured or destroyed by being cast into some
1094,MISCELLANEOUS,old and well-tried mould. Indeed the most truly academic works are
1095,MISCELLANEOUS,often those in which some ephemerally fashionable formula has been
1096,MISCELLANEOUS,blindly adopted without being understood. The mental habits of poets
1097,MISCELLANEOUS,"are as various as those of scientists or politicians. Wordsworth, who"
1098,MISCELLANEOUS,"far more than most poets drew his material from his own experience,"
1099,MISCELLANEOUS,was nevertheless inspired to invent his most felicitous work by such
1100,MISCELLANEOUS,traditional forms as the sonnet or the common ballad stanza: his _Ode
1101,MISCELLANEOUS,"to Duty_ is exactly modelled on a metrical invention of Gray, and the"
1102,MISCELLANEOUS,"pattern of his _Leech-Gatherer_, but for one slight variation, is the"
1103,MISCELLANEOUS,same as that of Shakespeare’s _Rape of Lucrece_. On the other hand Walt
1104,MISCELLANEOUS,Whitman spent many years laboriously floundering in search of a poetic
1105,MISCELLANEOUS,"method, and it was only late in life that his unconscious sense of"
1106,MISCELLANEOUS,form led him to write a few poems that are as perfect in design and as
1107,MISCELLANEOUS,moving as any fragment of Alcman.
1108,MISCELLANEOUS,
1109,MISCELLANEOUS,"In every fertile and creative age of literature, it will generally be"
1110,MISCELLANEOUS,found that there were two main stimulating influences at work: in the
1111,MISCELLANEOUS,"first place naturalism, or an awakened sensitiveness to the suggestive"
1112,MISCELLANEOUS,beauty of the actual world; and secondly the fascination exercised by
1113,MISCELLANEOUS,the masterpieces of earlier periods and alien cultures. By this I do
1114,MISCELLANEOUS,not mean the direct inheritance of a poetic medium. Milton no doubt
1115,MISCELLANEOUS,"learnt his metrical technique from Shakespeare and the Elizabethans,"
1116,MISCELLANEOUS,"but in everything else he owed far more to his loving study of Homer,"
1117,MISCELLANEOUS,"Euripides, Virgil and the Bible. Thus too the spiritual presence of"
1118,MISCELLANEOUS,"Homer is felt everywhere in the Greek lyrical and dramatic writers, and"
1119,MISCELLANEOUS,even in Theocritus; and thus emulous idolatry of Greek and Alexandrine
1120,MISCELLANEOUS,masterpieces quickened into life all that was best in Latin poetry;
1121,MISCELLANEOUS,while Virgil and Ovid in their turn became the schoolmasters of Dante
1122,MISCELLANEOUS,and the Renaissance. The tyranny of Latin over English poetry only
1123,MISCELLANEOUS,began to wane towards the end of the eighteenth century; then suddenly
1124,MISCELLANEOUS,"in Shelley and Keats, and later in Matthew Arnold, Swinburne, Mr."
1125,MISCELLANEOUS,"Bridges, and even Browning, the Hellenic spirit becomes a veritable"
1126,MISCELLANEOUS,Castalian fountain of inspiration. Now that the knowledge of Greek
1127,MISCELLANEOUS,"is likely to become a rare accomplishment, it is possible that its"
1128,MISCELLANEOUS,influence will die away as quickly as it flowered. Yet the imagination
1129,MISCELLANEOUS,is sometimes kindled by translations even more potently than by
1130,MISCELLANEOUS,"scholarship, as is shown by the case of Keats, who had small Latin"
1131,MISCELLANEOUS,"and less Greek. And indeed, apart from our ever-growing interest in"
1132,MISCELLANEOUS,"our own earlier literature, the most helpful and fertile impulse seems"
1133,MISCELLANEOUS,likely in the near future to come through translations of Oriental
1134,MISCELLANEOUS,"poetry, such as those by Mr. Waley and Mr. Nicholson. But from whatever"
1135,MISCELLANEOUS,"direction the wind may blow, it will be the most imaginative artists"
1136,MISCELLANEOUS,"who will first be sensitive to it, and the most skilful and discreet in"
1137,MISCELLANEOUS,"the use they put it to. The lesser crowd will, as ever, follow their"
1138,MISCELLANEOUS,"lead, until what was once a renovating breath of inspiration has become"
1139,MISCELLANEOUS,a stale and flatulent academicism.
1140,MISCELLANEOUS,
1141,MISCELLANEOUS,"Even if it be true, as I have suggested earlier in this essay, that"
1142,MISCELLANEOUS,"poetry has ceased to be a great popular and social art, there will be"
1143,MISCELLANEOUS,no need to regret the change in so far as it may make it more easy
1144,MISCELLANEOUS,"for poets to disregard fashionable success, and so to retain their"
1145,MISCELLANEOUS,artistic integrity. Yet there are certain dangers to which they will
1146,MISCELLANEOUS,become increasingly liable. An art which presupposes a select initiated
1147,MISCELLANEOUS,"audience, very quickly becomes over-precious, and, for all its"
1148,MISCELLANEOUS,"refinement, essentially parochial. The best art will take nothing for"
1149,MISCELLANEOUS,"granted in those to whom it is addressed, except artistic intelligence"
1150,MISCELLANEOUS,and that human nature which is common to us all. Poets whose idiom is
1151,MISCELLANEOUS,"not universal, but calculated for a cultured private coterie, write"
1152,MISCELLANEOUS,"with the risk of swift oblivion, so soon as the tide of æsthetic"
1153,MISCELLANEOUS,"caprice has turned. This is all the more regrettable, as such poetry is"
1154,MISCELLANEOUS,sometimes of great originality and beauty. The most frequent fault is
1155,MISCELLANEOUS,"obscurity, due either to an Alexandrine love of recondite allusions, or"
1156,MISCELLANEOUS,more often to an apparently studied neglect of transitions. A contempt
1157,MISCELLANEOUS,"for clarity has almost come to be regarded as an artistic virtue,"
1158,MISCELLANEOUS,"rather than as a vice, or at best an occasionally inevitable evil."
1159,MISCELLANEOUS,Nothing in truth can be more fundamentally inartistic than needless
1160,MISCELLANEOUS,"obscurity. Poetry that is intellectually and emotionally complex, is"
1161,MISCELLANEOUS,certain in any case to be difficult enough; and the less a reader is
1162,MISCELLANEOUS,"called upon to make avoidable mental effort, the more convincingly"
1163,MISCELLANEOUS,will the essential context of a poem be communicated to his mind. The
1164,MISCELLANEOUS,"medium of poetry consists not merely of words, but of speech, that is"
1165,MISCELLANEOUS,"of words, phrases and sentences in syntactic and logical relations to"
1166,MISCELLANEOUS,one another; and although these relations necessarily tend to be more
1167,MISCELLANEOUS,"emotional and less rational in poetry than in prose, because poetry is"
1168,MISCELLANEOUS,"the more emotional medium, yet there are limits which it is dangerous"
1169,MISCELLANEOUS,to exceed. Much no doubt depends upon the nature of the subject-matter.
1170,MISCELLANEOUS,"A chorus of Aeschylus, or a soliloquy of Macbeth may be very difficult"
1171,MISCELLANEOUS,to analyse and construe satisfactorily; yet their general drift is
1172,MISCELLANEOUS,usually clear enough. Cloudy vagueness or intricate subtlety may well
1173,MISCELLANEOUS,be necessary and legitimate qualities of a poem; but all superfluous
1174,MISCELLANEOUS,obscurity is æsthetically pure waste. Gerard Hopkins is a deplorable
1175,MISCELLANEOUS,"example of a poet of sincerity and genius, who damaged much of his best"
1176,MISCELLANEOUS,"work by not being sufficiently aware of the nature of his instrument,"
1177,MISCELLANEOUS,"which was the English language, or of his audience, who could only be"
1178,MISCELLANEOUS,educated English-speaking people. The admirers of such writers will
1179,MISCELLANEOUS,often quite honestly deny that they find them unduly difficult. They
1180,MISCELLANEOUS,probably forget how hard they have had to work in order to obtain their
1181,MISCELLANEOUS,reward. The trouble is that the poet ought to have done the larger part
1182,MISCELLANEOUS,of their work for them himself.
1183,MISCELLANEOUS,
1184,MISCELLANEOUS,"Whatever may be the destinies of English poetry, I do not think it is"
1185,MISCELLANEOUS,likely to achieve anything very remarkable until we have grown out of
1186,MISCELLANEOUS,"a doctrine or prejudice that is widely prevalent just now, that is to"
1187,MISCELLANEOUS,say our dislike and suspicion of rhetoric. By rhetoric I mean the sum
1188,MISCELLANEOUS,"of all the artifices and habits of syntax, phrasing and diction which"
1189,MISCELLANEOUS,are necessary in order to sustain the movement and the structure of a
1190,MISCELLANEOUS,"poem that is designed on a large scale, or of a short poem of great"
1191,MISCELLANEOUS,"emotional intensity. That may be a loose and unsatisfactory definition,"
1192,MISCELLANEOUS,but it is the best I can come by. Criticism nowadays seems to be mainly
1193,MISCELLANEOUS,interested in lyrical poetry on a small scale; and this may account
1194,MISCELLANEOUS,for the disfavour into which the very name of rhetoric has fallen: for
1195,MISCELLANEOUS,it is true that short lyrics of a certain kind can afford to dispense
1196,MISCELLANEOUS,"with rhetoric, in the sense in which I am using the word. Yet if the"
1197,MISCELLANEOUS,"European poets of the past, and their public, had been as shy of"
1198,MISCELLANEOUS,"rhetoric as we are at present, it is certain that there would have been"
1199,MISCELLANEOUS,"no Homer to begin with, still less an Aeschylus, a Milton, a Racine,"
1200,MISCELLANEOUS,or a Shelley. We might have produced poetry of exquisite charm and
1201,MISCELLANEOUS,"refinement, but its imaginative range and vitality would probably have"
1202,MISCELLANEOUS,"been as restricted as that of the Japanese, or of the later Chinese"
1203,MISCELLANEOUS,poets. If we compare in Mr. Waley’s translations the classical Tang
1204,MISCELLANEOUS,"poets with those earlier primitive writers, who were not yet afraid of"
1205,MISCELLANEOUS,"composing on a fairly large scale, we shall then see what may be the"
1206,MISCELLANEOUS,fate of a literature that has grown ashamed of employing the breadth
1207,MISCELLANEOUS,and energy of movement without which great poetry is impossible. Of
1208,MISCELLANEOUS,"course there has always been, and always will be, bad rhetoric, as well"
1209,MISCELLANEOUS,"as good. The inferior imitators of Milton, for instance, used to impose"
1210,MISCELLANEOUS,upon their own commonplace poetic conceptions the whole stylistic
1211,MISCELLANEOUS,apparatus which Milton had elaborated for the purpose of sustaining the
1212,MISCELLANEOUS,"enormous movement of his verse, and enriching its texture. Bad rhetoric"
1213,MISCELLANEOUS,"is always stale rhetoric. “No bird,” as Blake says, “soars too high, if"
1214,MISCELLANEOUS,he soars with his own wings.”
1215,MISCELLANEOUS,
1216,MISCELLANEOUS,But it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good; and we may
1217,MISCELLANEOUS,"gratefully welcome this impatience of rhetoric, in so far as it"
1218,MISCELLANEOUS,serves to purify the air of that pestilential blight which is known
1219,MISCELLANEOUS,"as “poetic,” but would be more truthfully named “prosaic diction.” To"
1220,MISCELLANEOUS,"quote Mr. Santayana, “when use has worn down a poetic phrase to its"
1221,MISCELLANEOUS,"external import, and rendered it an indifferent symbol for a particular"
1222,MISCELLANEOUS,"thing, that phrase has become prosaic. It has also become, by the same"
1223,MISCELLANEOUS,"process, transparent and purely instrumental.” Poetry, when it is"
1224,MISCELLANEOUS,"healthy and vigorous, is continually discarding such worn-out words and"
1225,MISCELLANEOUS,"phrases, as being indeed no longer poetical enough for its purposes."
1226,MISCELLANEOUS,"It is the simpler, homelier words and idioms of everyday speech"
1227,MISCELLANEOUS,that carry with them most poetic suggestion. Not but what rare and
1228,MISCELLANEOUS,"far-fetched diction may not on fit occasions be ornamentally useful,"
1229,MISCELLANEOUS,or justify itself by its grandeur and impressiveness. Shakespeare knew
1230,MISCELLANEOUS,"his business when he wrote, “The multitudinous seas incarnadine”;"
1231,MISCELLANEOUS,but how thankful we should have been if succeeding poets had had the
1232,MISCELLANEOUS,wisdom to refrain from debasing his coinage! Poetry need not be always
1233,MISCELLANEOUS,"simple, sensuous or passionate; but when it wishes to be decorative"
1234,MISCELLANEOUS,"or extravagant, it will do well to remember the fable of the jay in"
1235,MISCELLANEOUS,"peacock’s feathers, and grow novel and appropriate plumage of its own."
1236,MISCELLANEOUS,
1237,MISCELLANEOUS,"With regard to poetic inversion, there is bound to be great divergence"
1238,MISCELLANEOUS,both in practice and in critical taste. Swinburne considered Ben
1239,MISCELLANEOUS,"Jonson’s line, “But might I of Jove’s nectar sup,” to be an inexcusable"
1240,MISCELLANEOUS,blemish in an otherwise perfect masterpiece. Yet Jacobean readers would
1241,MISCELLANEOUS,probably have found the order of the words sufficiently natural and
1242,MISCELLANEOUS,unforced. It is true that since then there has been a considerable
1243,MISCELLANEOUS,"change in our linguistic sense, due in part to the long dominance"
1244,MISCELLANEOUS,"of prose during the eighteenth century, and in part to the waning"
1245,MISCELLANEOUS,influence of Latin. Nevertheless even now the best writers in their
1246,MISCELLANEOUS,"most genuinely poetic moments still assert for themselves, though"
1247,MISCELLANEOUS,"within narrower limits, the licence of modifying the strict grammatical"
1248,MISCELLANEOUS,order. This surely is as it ought to be; for though a language like
1249,MISCELLANEOUS,"ours, which has shed most of its inflections, is compelled to have"
1250,MISCELLANEOUS,"a more rigid word-order than an inflected language like Latin, yet"
1251,MISCELLANEOUS,"emotional stress and the need for rhetorical emphasis will always, even"
1252,MISCELLANEOUS,"in prose, tempt writers to violate the conventional rules, and still"
1253,MISCELLANEOUS,"more in poetry, where the position of words and phrases in relation to"
1254,MISCELLANEOUS,"the line is of such, paramount importance."

1263,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,
1264,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"There is another legend concerning the ancient Hellenic Muses, which"
1265,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,I would here like to recall. It is said that one of their most gifted
1266,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"and distinguished pupils, the Thessalian bard Thamyris, having made"
1267,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"certain innovations in the orthodox technique of poetry, and having"
1268,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,moreover enlarged its boundaries by annexing subject-matter that had
1269,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"hitherto been considered beneath the dignity of classic art, one day"
1270,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,had the audacity to challenge his august schoolmistresses to a contest
1271,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"of song. Apollo was the umpire, and he, as might have been expected,"
1272,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,adjudged the victory to his divine relatives. The presumptuous mortal
1273,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"was condemned to lose his eyes, and forbidden henceforth to practise"
1274,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,the sacred art of poesy. The baser medium of prose would be good enough
1275,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,for such renegade impostors. But the result was far different from
1276,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"what the Goddesses had expected. Thamyris, though blinded, remained"
1277,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"recalcitrant, and retaining all his former skill and genius, like his"
1278,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"remote descendants, blind Maeonides and Milton, continued to produce"
1279,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"masterpiece after masterpiece. Worse still, he became a popular hero"
1280,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"among the miserable mortal multitude, who naturally sided with the"
1281,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,victim of divine jealousy. Moreover Thamyris soon afterwards became
1282,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"the father of a numerous family, and their descendants, multiplying"
1283,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"throughout the world, inherited, not his blindness, but his poetical"
1284,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,gifts. Thus it comes about that all true poets and lovers of poetry are
1285,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"children of Thamyris, and little though they know it, have each some"
1286,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,few drops of his inspired and rebellious blood running in their veins.
1287,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"If the Muses had wished effectively to stamp out heresy, they would"
1288,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"have been wiser had they followed the example of Apollo, who flayed"
1289,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"alive that other æsthetic mutineer, Marsyas, thus robbing him not only"
1290,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"of life, but of the hope of heretical offspring."
1291,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,
1292,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,Now it appears to me that this tale must have been a prophetic
1293,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"fable, intended to symbolise certain important aspects of man’s"
1294,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"poetic evolution. If the Muses and Apollo represent the established,"
1295,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"conservative tradition of poetry, then in Thamyris must be embodied"
1296,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,the perennial revolt of the creative younger generation against the
1297,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,prestige and authority of the past. Though the penalty of rebellion may
1298,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"sometimes be blindness, egoism and eccentricity, yet the sacred fire"
1299,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"will remain alive in the heart of the rebel, and will be handed down by"
1300,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"him to his posterity, who, themselves neither blind nor mutinous, will"
1301,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,often become in turn the persecutors of their own children. Thus the
1302,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"divine flame will never cease to burn, and generation after generation"
1303,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,the youth of poetry will be renewed.
1304,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,
1305,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,Nevertheless there are those who take a gloomier view of man’s
1306,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"destinies. Poetry, they tell us, like mythology, religion and"
1307,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"metaphysics, is a primitive and puerile function of the human mind."
1308,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"It is already becoming superseded by less rudimentary, more rational"
1309,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,means of self-expression. We are entering upon an era of science and
1310,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"prose, and may as well at once frankly put away poetry, along with"
1311,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,other childish things. At the beginning of this essay I have tried to
1312,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,suggest how much and how little truth there may be in this view. I have
1313,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,admitted that the dissociation of poetry from music and intonation has
1314,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,to a great extent diminished the immediate potency of its sensuous
1315,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,and emotional appeal; but I have argued that the new medium of spoken
1316,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"verse, although it may have grown more similar to prose, is yet very"
1317,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"far from being identical with it, either formally, or in the nature"
1318,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"of its subject-matter. Prose is the more transparent, self-effacing"
1319,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,instrument. Its value consists not so much in itself (though it may
1320,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"possess a real sensuous charm and beauty of its own), but rather in"
1321,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,its intellectual content and the knowledge it conveys. But the value
1322,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,of poetry resides primarily in the medium itself. If that be not
1323,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"beautiful, then verse is a thing of naught, and worse than naught."
1324,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"None the less poetry should be no mere meaningless verbal incantation,"
1325,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,nor yet a melodious transmitter of congenial lies and irresponsible
1326,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"reverie. It is a means of discourse, of which the content should be"
1327,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"neither science nor history nor speculation in their abstract purity,"
1328,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"but all these and much else besides, enveloped and humanised by"
1329,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"emotion, and presented with all the moving pathos and beauty which is"
1330,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"inherent in them, but which the less imaginative prosaic medium cannot"
1331,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"so effectually reveal. So long as human nature remains what it is now,"
1332,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,as in spite of cynical prognostications it is likely to do for some
1333,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"time to come, it will both demand and obtain satisfaction for its ideal"
1334,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"needs from literature, as well as from the musical and plastic arts:"
1335,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"and in fact, if verse were to be proscribed or abandoned by general"
1336,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"consent, we should be soon compelled to find an awkward substitute"
1337,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"for it in rhythmical or poetic prose. Yet, in spite of the beauty and"
1338,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"grandeur of our translations of biblical Hebrew verse, and of certain"
1339,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"majestical passages in such writers as Sir Thomas Browne, rhythmical"
1340,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,prose has seldom proved itself able to compete with formal poetry. It
1341,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"is too primitive, too monotonous and cumbersome to perform more than a"
1342,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"small part of the various functions of modern spoken verse, to which we"
1343,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,should inevitably be driven before long to revert.
1344,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,
1345,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"Yet though the disappearance of poetry is unlikely, and would be a"
1346,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"real disaster, it is much to be desired that poetry should become"
1347,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"more rational and responsible, more intelligently aware of the best"
1348,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,interests and ideals of its most civilised contemporaries. It would be
1349,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,childish and unwise for poets to disregard the fact that our habits
1350,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,of mind are growing continually more scientific. The function of the
1351,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"imagination is to interpret and illuminate reality, and it cannot"
1352,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,therefore neglect or despise the normal aspects under which reality
1353,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,presents itself to the human mind. But it must also appeal to the human
1354,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,heart; and since the passions and dreams of the heart are less mutable
1355,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"than the intellect, it is in this respect that the nature of poetry is"
1356,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,least likely to suffer any fundamental change. The garment in which it
1357,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"clothes itself will alter, as language alters, and as poets of genius"
1358,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,are moved to enlarge or contract it. As long as men use articulate
1359,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"speech, some few among them will take delight in moulding it into"
1360,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"rhythmical forms of harmonious beauty, in order to find the most"
1361,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,perfect expression for the intimate desires and movements of the soul.
1362,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,
1363,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,Perhaps I should have been more prudent if I had confined my discussion
1364,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"to the more purely technical aspect of poetry, without venturing upon"
1365,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"the dangerous sea of general reflections upon style and theme, attitude"
1366,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"and tendency. I have at least tried to refrain from dogma and prophecy,"
1367,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,and attempted rather to suggest future possibilities by drawing
1368,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,attention to the lessons which we can still learn from the past. It may
1369,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,well be that the only really profitable discussions about poetry are
1370,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,technical discussions. “The thought of man is not triable. Even the
1371,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"Devil knoweth not the thought of man,” said the old legal maxim. And"
1372,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"so, to my mind, the thought, the soul of the Muse of modern poetry is"
1373,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"not triable, nor discussable; but her actions are. And what else are"
1374,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,her actions but her successes and failures in exploiting her medium?
1375,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"Although her golden age may seem to lie in the past, and her future be"
1376,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"uncertain and beset with perils, yet there is no need to despair of her"
1377,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"salvation. To revert to the apologue with which I began, though I may"
1378,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,"feel some sympathy with the celestial point of view, I am not really on"
1379,THE CHILDREN OF THAMYRIS,the side of the angels.
