151,THE THREE CHERRY TREES,"There were three cherry trees once,"

153,THE THREE CHERRY TREES,"And there for delight of so gladsome a sight,"
154,THE THREE CHERRY TREES,"Walked a most beautiful lady,"
155,THE THREE CHERRY TREES,Dreamed a most beautiful lady.

157,THE THREE CHERRY TREES,"Birds in those branches did sing,"
158,THE THREE CHERRY TREES,"Blackbird and throstle and linnet,"

163,THE THREE CHERRY TREES,"But blossoms to berries do come,"
164,THE THREE CHERRY TREES,"All hanging on stalks light and slender,"

166,THE THREE CHERRY TREES,With vows sweet and merry and tender;
167,THE THREE CHERRY TREES,A lover with voice low and tender.
168,THE THREE CHERRY TREES,
169,THE THREE CHERRY TREES,Moss and lichen the green branches deck;
170,THE THREE CHERRY TREES,Weeds nod in its paths green and shady:
171,THE THREE CHERRY TREES,"Yet a light footstep seems there to wander in dreams,"
172,THE THREE CHERRY TREES,"The ghost of that beautiful lady,"
173,THE THREE CHERRY TREES,That happy and beautiful lady.

182,OLD SUSAN,"With one fat guttering candle lit,"
183,OLD SUSAN,And window opened wide to win
184,OLD SUSAN,The sweet night air to enter in;
185,OLD SUSAN,"There, with a thumb to keep her place"
186,OLD SUSAN,"She'd read, with stern and wrinkled face,"
187,OLD SUSAN,Her mild eyes gliding very slow
188,OLD SUSAN,"Across the letters to and fro,"
189,OLD SUSAN,While wagged the guttering candle flame
190,OLD SUSAN,In the wind that through the window came.
191,OLD SUSAN,And sometimes in the silence she
192,OLD SUSAN,"Would mumble a sentence audibly,"
193,OLD SUSAN,"Or shake her head as if to say,"
194,OLD SUSAN,"'You silly souls, to act this way!'"
195,OLD SUSAN,"And never a sound from night I'd hear,"
196,OLD SUSAN,Unless some far-off cock crowed clear;
197,OLD SUSAN,Or her old shuffling thumb should turn
198,OLD SUSAN,"Another page; and rapt and stern,"
199,OLD SUSAN,Through her great glasses bent on me
200,OLD SUSAN,She'd glance into reality;
201,OLD SUSAN,"And shake her round old silvery head,"
202,OLD SUSAN,With--'You!--I thought you was in bed!'--
203,OLD SUSAN,"Only to tilt her book again,"
204,OLD SUSAN,And rooted in Romance remain.

264,MISS LOO,The westering sunshine in a pool
265,MISS LOO,Floats in her parlour still and cool;
266,MISS LOO,"While the slim bird its lean wires shakes,"
267,MISS LOO,As into piercing song it breaks;

269,MISS LOO,"Dream, wake; wake, dream, in one brief bar."

273,MISS LOO,"And large hands folded on the tray,"
274,MISS LOO,Musing the afternoon away;
275,MISS LOO,Her satin bosom heaving slow
276,MISS LOO,"With sighs that softly ebb and flow,"
277,MISS LOO,"And her plain face in such dismay,"
278,MISS LOO,It seems unkind to look her way:
279,MISS LOO,Until all cheerful back will come
280,MISS LOO,Her cheerful gleaming spirit home:
281,MISS LOO,And one would think that poor Miss Loo
282,MISS LOO,"Asked nothing else, if she had you."

296,THE TAILOR,"Sometimes he stays, and o'er his thread"
297,THE TAILOR,Leans sidelong his old tousled head;
298,THE TAILOR,Or stoops to peer with half-shut eye
299,THE TAILOR,When some strange footfall echoes by;
300,THE TAILOR,Till clearer gleams his candle's spark
301,THE TAILOR,Into the dusty summer dark.
302,THE TAILOR,"Then from his crosslegs he gets down,"

1220,QUEEN DJENIRA,And those of earth about her porch
1221,QUEEN DJENIRA,Of shadow cool and grey
1222,QUEEN DJENIRA,"Their sidelong beaks in silence lean,"
1223,QUEEN DJENIRA,And silent flit away.

1231,NEVER-TO-BE,"Down by the waters of the sea,"
1232,NEVER-TO-BE,Reigns the King of Never-to-be.
1233,NEVER-TO-BE,His palace walls are black with night;
1234,NEVER-TO-BE,"His torches star and moonès light,"
1235,NEVER-TO-BE,And for his timepiece deep and grave
1236,NEVER-TO-BE,Beats on the green unhastening wave.
1237,NEVER-TO-BE,
1238,NEVER-TO-BE,Windswept are his high corridors;
1239,NEVER-TO-BE,His pleasance the sea-mantled shores;
1240,NEVER-TO-BE,For sentinel a shadow stands
1241,NEVER-TO-BE,"With hair in heaven, and cloudy hands;"
1242,NEVER-TO-BE,"And round his bed, king's guards to be,"
1243,NEVER-TO-BE,Watch pines in iron solemnity.
1244,NEVER-TO-BE,
1245,NEVER-TO-BE,His hound is mute; his steed at will
1246,NEVER-TO-BE,Roams pastures deep with asphodel;
1247,NEVER-TO-BE,His queen is to her slumber gone;
1248,NEVER-TO-BE,"His courtiers mute lie, hewn in stone;"
1249,NEVER-TO-BE,He hath forgot where he did hide
1250,NEVER-TO-BE,His sceptre in the mountain-side.
1251,NEVER-TO-BE,
1252,NEVER-TO-BE,"Grey-capped and muttering, mad is he--"
1253,NEVER-TO-BE,The childless King of Never-to-be;
1254,NEVER-TO-BE,For all his people in the deep
1255,NEVER-TO-BE,Keep everlasting fast asleep;
1256,NEVER-TO-BE,"And all his realm is foam and rain,"

1266,THE DARK CHATEAU,"Stands ever open to me,"
1267,THE DARK CHATEAU,"In far ravines dream-waters flow,"
1268,THE DARK CHATEAU,Descending soundlessly;
1269,THE DARK CHATEAU,"Above its peaks the eagle floats,"
1270,THE DARK CHATEAU,Lone in a sunless sky;
1271,THE DARK CHATEAU,Mute are the golden woodland throats
1272,THE DARK CHATEAU,Of the birds flitting by.
1273,THE DARK CHATEAU,
1274,THE DARK CHATEAU,No voice is audible. The wind
1275,THE DARK CHATEAU,Sleeps in its peace.
1276,THE DARK CHATEAU,No flower of the light can find
1277,THE DARK CHATEAU,Refuge 'neath its trees;

1279,THE DARK CHATEAU,"Mingled with wilding rose,"
1280,THE DARK CHATEAU,"And cypress, morn and evening, time's"
1281,THE DARK CHATEAU,Black shadow throws.
1282,THE DARK CHATEAU,
1283,THE DARK CHATEAU,"All vacant, and unknown;"
1284,THE DARK CHATEAU,Only the dreamer steps
1285,THE DARK CHATEAU,"From stone to hollow stone,"
1286,THE DARK CHATEAU,"Where the green moss sleeps,"
1287,THE DARK CHATEAU,"Peers at the river in its deeps,"
1288,THE DARK CHATEAU,"The eagle lone in the sky,"
1289,THE DARK CHATEAU,"While the dew of evening drips,"
1290,THE DARK CHATEAU,Coldly and silently.
1291,THE DARK CHATEAU,
1292,THE DARK CHATEAU,Would that I could press in!--
1293,THE DARK CHATEAU,Into each secret room;
1294,THE DARK CHATEAU,Would that my sleep-bright eyes could win
1295,THE DARK CHATEAU,To the inner gloom;
1296,THE DARK CHATEAU,"Gaze from its high windows,"
1297,THE DARK CHATEAU,"Far down its mouldering walls,"
1298,THE DARK CHATEAU,"Where amber-clear still Lethe flows,"
1299,THE DARK CHATEAU,And foaming falls.
1300,THE DARK CHATEAU,
1301,THE DARK CHATEAU,"But ever as I gaze,"
1302,THE DARK CHATEAU,From slumber soft doth come
1303,THE DARK CHATEAU,Some touch my stagnant sense to raise
1304,THE DARK CHATEAU,To its old earthly home;
1305,THE DARK CHATEAU,Fades then that sky serene;
1306,THE DARK CHATEAU,And peak of ageless snow;

1319,THE DWELLING-PLACE,Named only 'Alas.'
1320,THE DWELLING-PLACE,
1321,THE DWELLING-PLACE,Yet happy as the wild birds in the glades
1322,THE DWELLING-PLACE,"Of that green forest, thridding the still air"
1323,THE DWELLING-PLACE,"With low continued heedless serenades,"
1324,THE DWELLING-PLACE,Its heedless people were.
1325,THE DWELLING-PLACE,
1326,THE DWELLING-PLACE,"The throbbing chords of violin and lute,"
1327,THE DWELLING-PLACE,"The lustre of lean tapers in dark eyes,"
1328,THE DWELLING-PLACE,"Fair colours, beauteous flowers, dainty fruit"
1329,THE DWELLING-PLACE,Made earth seem Paradise
1330,THE DWELLING-PLACE,
1331,THE DWELLING-PLACE,To them that dwelt within this lonely house:
1332,THE DWELLING-PLACE,"Like children of the gods in lasting peace,"
1333,THE DWELLING-PLACE,"They ate, sang, danced, as if each day's carouse"
1334,THE DWELLING-PLACE,"Need never pause, nor cease."
1335,THE DWELLING-PLACE,
1336,THE DWELLING-PLACE,"Some might cry, Vanity! to a weeping lyre,"
1337,THE DWELLING-PLACE,"Some in that deep pool mock their longings vain,"
1338,THE DWELLING-PLACE,"Came yet at last long silence to the wire,"
1339,THE DWELLING-PLACE,And dark did dark remain.
1340,THE DWELLING-PLACE,
1341,THE DWELLING-PLACE,"Some to the hunt would wend, with hound and horn,"
1342,THE DWELLING-PLACE,"And clash of silver, beauty, bravery, pride,"
1343,THE DWELLING-PLACE,Heeding not one who on white horse upborne
1344,THE DWELLING-PLACE,With soundless hoofs did ride.
1345,THE DWELLING-PLACE,
1346,THE DWELLING-PLACE,Dreamers there were who watched the hours away
1347,THE DWELLING-PLACE,Beside a fountain's foam. And in the sweet
1348,THE DWELLING-PLACE,"Of phantom evening, 'neath the night-bird's lay,"
1349,THE DWELLING-PLACE,Did loved with loved-one meet.
1350,THE DWELLING-PLACE,
1351,THE DWELLING-PLACE,"All, all were children, for, the long day done,"
1352,THE DWELLING-PLACE,They barred the heavy door 'gainst lightfoot fear;
1353,THE DWELLING-PLACE,"And few words spake though one known face was gone,"
1354,THE DWELLING-PLACE,Yet still seemed hovering near.
1355,THE DWELLING-PLACE,
1356,THE DWELLING-PLACE,They heaped the bright fire higher; poured dark wine;
1357,THE DWELLING-PLACE,And in long revelry dazed the questioning eye;
1358,THE DWELLING-PLACE,Curtained three-fold the heart-dismaying shine
1359,THE DWELLING-PLACE,Of midnight streaming by.
1360,THE DWELLING-PLACE,
1361,THE DWELLING-PLACE,"They shut the dark out from the painted wall,"
1362,THE DWELLING-PLACE,"With candles dared the shadow at the door,"
1363,THE DWELLING-PLACE,Sang down the faint reiterated call
1364,THE DWELLING-PLACE,Of those who came no more.
1365,THE DWELLING-PLACE,
1366,THE DWELLING-PLACE,"Yet clear above that portal plain was writ,"
1367,THE DWELLING-PLACE,Confronting each at length alone to pass

1376,THE LISTENERS,
1377,THE LISTENERS,"'Is there anybody there?' said the Traveller,"
1378,THE LISTENERS,Knocking on the moonlit door;
1379,THE LISTENERS,And his horse in the silence champed the grasses
1380,THE LISTENERS,Of the forest's ferny floor:
1381,THE LISTENERS,"And a bird flew up out of the turret,"
1382,THE LISTENERS,Above the Traveller's head:
1383,THE LISTENERS,And he smote upon the door again a second time;
1384,THE LISTENERS,'Is there anybody there?' he said.
1385,THE LISTENERS,But no one descended to the Traveller;
1386,THE LISTENERS,No head from the leaf-fringed sill
1387,THE LISTENERS,"Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes,"
1388,THE LISTENERS,Where he stood perplexed and still.
1389,THE LISTENERS,But only a host of phantom listeners
1390,THE LISTENERS,That dwelt in the lone house then
1391,THE LISTENERS,Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight
1392,THE LISTENERS,To that voice from the world of men:
1393,THE LISTENERS,"Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,"
1394,THE LISTENERS,"That goes down to the empty hall,"
1395,THE LISTENERS,Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken
1396,THE LISTENERS,By the lonely Traveller's call.
1397,THE LISTENERS,"And he felt in his heart their strangeness,"
1398,THE LISTENERS,"Their stillness answering his cry,"
1399,THE LISTENERS,"While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,"
1400,THE LISTENERS,'Neath the starred and leafy sky;
1401,THE LISTENERS,"For he suddenly smote on the door, even"
1402,THE LISTENERS,"Louder, and lifted his head:--"
1403,THE LISTENERS,"'Tell them I came, and no one answered,"
1404,THE LISTENERS,"That I kept my word,' he said."
1405,THE LISTENERS,"Never the least stir made the listeners,"
1406,THE LISTENERS,Though every word he spake
1407,THE LISTENERS,Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house
1408,THE LISTENERS,From the one man left awake:
1409,THE LISTENERS,"Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,"
1410,THE LISTENERS,"And the sound of iron on stone,"
1411,THE LISTENERS,"And how the silence surged softly backward,"
1412,THE LISTENERS,When the plunging hoofs were gone.

1425,TIME PASSES,As to Ocean low he sped.
1426,TIME PASSES,
1427,TIME PASSES,Lucent and lovely

1482,THE JOURNEY,Heart-sick of his journey was the Wanderer;
1483,THE JOURNEY,Footsore and sad was he;
1484,THE JOURNEY,"And a Witch who long had lurked by the wayside,"
1485,THE JOURNEY,Looked out of sorcery.
1486,THE JOURNEY,
1487,THE JOURNEY,"'Lift up your eyes, you lonely Wanderer,'"
1488,THE JOURNEY,She peeped from her casement small;
1489,THE JOURNEY,"'Here's shelter and quiet to give you rest, young man,"
1490,THE JOURNEY,And apples for thirst withal.'
1491,THE JOURNEY,
1492,THE JOURNEY,"And he looked up out of his sad reverie,"
1493,THE JOURNEY,"And saw all the woods in green,"
1494,THE JOURNEY,"With birds that flitted feathered in the dappling,"
1495,THE JOURNEY,The jewel-bright leaves between.
1496,THE JOURNEY,
1497,THE JOURNEY,"And he lifted up his face towards her lattice,"
1498,THE JOURNEY,"And there, alluring-wise,"
1499,THE JOURNEY,"Slanting through the silence of the long past,"
1500,THE JOURNEY,Dwelt the still green Witch's eyes.
1501,THE JOURNEY,
1502,THE JOURNEY,And vaguely from the hiding-place of memory
1503,THE JOURNEY,Voices seemed to cry;
1504,THE JOURNEY,'What is the darkness of one brief life-time
1505,THE JOURNEY,To the deaths thou hast made us die?
1506,THE JOURNEY,
1507,THE JOURNEY,'Heed not the words of the Enchantress
1508,THE JOURNEY,Who would us still betray!'
1509,THE JOURNEY,"And sad with the echo of their reproaches,"
1510,THE JOURNEY,"Doubting, he turned away."
1511,THE JOURNEY,
1512,THE JOURNEY,"'I may not shelter 'neath your roof, lady,"
1513,THE JOURNEY,"Nor in this wood's green shadow seek repose,"
1514,THE JOURNEY,Nor will your apples quench the thirst
1515,THE JOURNEY,A homesick wanderer knows.'
1516,THE JOURNEY,
1517,THE JOURNEY,"'""Homesick,"" forsooth!' she softly mocked him:"
1518,THE JOURNEY,And the beauty in her face
1519,THE JOURNEY,Made in the sunshine pale and trembling
1520,THE JOURNEY,A stillness in that place.
1521,THE JOURNEY,
1522,THE JOURNEY,"And he sighed, as if in fear, the young Wanderer,"
1523,THE JOURNEY,"Looking to left and to right,"
1524,THE JOURNEY,"Where the endless narrow road swept onward,"
1525,THE JOURNEY,In the distance lost to sight.
1526,THE JOURNEY,
1527,THE JOURNEY,"And there fell upon his sense the briar,"
1528,THE JOURNEY,"Haunting the air with its breath,"
1529,THE JOURNEY,"And the faint shrill sweetness of the birds' throats,"
1530,THE JOURNEY,Their tent of leaves beneath.
1531,THE JOURNEY,
1532,THE JOURNEY,"And there was the Witch, in no wise heeding;"
1533,THE JOURNEY,"Her arbour, and fruit-filled dish,"
1534,THE JOURNEY,"Her pitcher of well-water, and clear damask--"
1535,THE JOURNEY,All that the weary wish.
1536,THE JOURNEY,
1537,THE JOURNEY,And the last gold beam across the green world
1538,THE JOURNEY,"Faltered and failed, as he"
1539,THE JOURNEY,Remembered his solitude and the dark night's
1540,THE JOURNEY,Inhospitality.
1541,THE JOURNEY,
1542,THE JOURNEY,His shoulders were bowed with his knapsack;
1543,THE JOURNEY,His staff trailed heavy in the dust;
1544,THE JOURNEY,"His eyes were dazed, and hopeless of the white road"
1545,THE JOURNEY,Which tread all pilgrims must.
1546,THE JOURNEY,
1547,THE JOURNEY,And he looked upon the Witch with eyes of sorrow
1548,THE JOURNEY,In the darkening of the day;
1549,THE JOURNEY,And turned him aside into oblivion;
1550,THE JOURNEY,And the voices died away....
1551,THE JOURNEY,
1552,THE JOURNEY,And the Witch stepped down from her casement:
1553,THE JOURNEY,In the hush of night he heard
1554,THE JOURNEY,The calling and wailing in dewy thicket
1555,THE JOURNEY,Of bird to hidden bird.
1556,THE JOURNEY,
1557,THE JOURNEY,And gloom stole all her burning crimson;
1558,THE JOURNEY,Remote and faint in space
1559,THE JOURNEY,As stars in gathering shadow of the evening
1560,THE JOURNEY,Seemed now her phantom face.
1561,THE JOURNEY,
1562,THE JOURNEY,"And one night's rest shall be a myriad,"
1563,THE JOURNEY,Midst dreams that come and go;
1564,THE JOURNEY,"Till heedless fate, unmoved by weakness, bring him"
1565,THE JOURNEY,This same strange by-way through:
1566,THE JOURNEY,
1567,THE JOURNEY,"To the beauty of earth that fades in ashes,"
1568,THE JOURNEY,"The lips of welcome, and the eyes"
1569,THE JOURNEY,More beauteous than the feeble shine of Hesper
1570,THE JOURNEY,Lone in the lightening skies:
1571,THE JOURNEY,
1572,THE JOURNEY,Till once again the Witch's guile entreat him;
1573,THE JOURNEY,"But, worn with wisdom, he"
1574,THE JOURNEY,Steadfast and cold shall choose the dark night's
1575,THE JOURNEY,Inhospitality.
