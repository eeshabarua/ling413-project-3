74,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"How calm and firm and true,"
75,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"Unspotted by its wrong and crime,"
76,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,He walked the dark earth through.
77,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"The lust of power, the love of gain,"
78,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,The thousand lures of sin
79,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"Around him, had no power to stain"
80,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,The purity within.
81,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
82,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,With that deep insight which detects
83,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"All great things in the small,"

85,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"The spiritual life of all,"
86,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"He walked by faith and not by sight,"
87,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,By love and not by law;
88,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,The presence of the wrong or right
89,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,He rather felt than saw.
90,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
91,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"He felt that wrong with wrong partakes,"
92,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"That nothing stands alone,"
93,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"That whoso gives the motive, makes"
94,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,His brother's sin his own.
95,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"And, pausing not for doubtful choice"
96,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"Of evils great or small,"
97,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,He listened to that inward voice
98,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,Which called away from all.
99,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
100,THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"O Spirit of that early day,"

117,DEMOCRACY.,
118,DEMOCRACY.,"BEARER of Freedom's holy light,"
119,DEMOCRACY.,"Breaker of Slavery's chain and rod,"
120,DEMOCRACY.,"The foe of all which pains the sight,"
121,DEMOCRACY.,Or wounds the generous ear of God!
122,DEMOCRACY.,
123,DEMOCRACY.,"Beautiful yet thy temples rise,"
124,DEMOCRACY.,Though there profaning gifts are thrown;
125,DEMOCRACY.,And fires unkindled of the skies
126,DEMOCRACY.,Are glaring round thy altar-stone.
127,DEMOCRACY.,
128,DEMOCRACY.,"Still sacred, though thy name be breathed"
129,DEMOCRACY.,By those whose hearts thy truth deride;
130,DEMOCRACY.,"And garlands, plucked from thee, are wreathed"
131,DEMOCRACY.,Around the haughty brows of Pride.
132,DEMOCRACY.,
133,DEMOCRACY.,"Oh, ideal of my boyhood's time!"
134,DEMOCRACY.,"The faith in which my father stood,"

136,DEMOCRACY.,Had stained thy peaceful courts with blood!
137,DEMOCRACY.,
138,DEMOCRACY.,"Still to those courts my footsteps turn,"
139,DEMOCRACY.,"For through the mists which darken there,"
140,DEMOCRACY.,"I see the flame of Freedom burn,--"
141,DEMOCRACY.,The Kebla of the patriot's prayer!
142,DEMOCRACY.,
143,DEMOCRACY.,"The generous feeling, pure and warm,"
144,DEMOCRACY.,Which owns the right of all divine;
145,DEMOCRACY.,"The pitying heart, the helping arm,"
146,DEMOCRACY.,"The prompt self-sacrifice, are thine."
147,DEMOCRACY.,
148,DEMOCRACY.,"Beneath thy broad, impartial eye,"
149,DEMOCRACY.,How fade the lines of caste and birth!
150,DEMOCRACY.,How equal in their suffering lie
151,DEMOCRACY.,The groaning multitudes of earth!
152,DEMOCRACY.,
153,DEMOCRACY.,"Still to a stricken brother true,"
154,DEMOCRACY.,Whatever clime hath nurtured him;
155,DEMOCRACY.,As stooped to heal the wounded Jew
156,DEMOCRACY.,The worshipper of Gerizim.
157,DEMOCRACY.,
158,DEMOCRACY.,"By misery unrepelled, unawed"
159,DEMOCRACY.,"By pomp or power, thou seest a Man"

163,DEMOCRACY.,"Through all disguise, form, place, or name,"

170,DEMOCRACY.,"The crown upon his forehead set,"
171,DEMOCRACY.,The immortal gift of God to him.
172,DEMOCRACY.,
173,DEMOCRACY.,And there is reverence in thy look;
174,DEMOCRACY.,For that frail form which mortals wear
175,DEMOCRACY.,"The Spirit of the Holiest took,"
176,DEMOCRACY.,And veiled His perfect brightness there.
177,DEMOCRACY.,
178,DEMOCRACY.,Not from the shallow babbling fount
179,DEMOCRACY.,Of vain philosophy thou art;
180,DEMOCRACY.,He who of old on Syria's Mount
181,DEMOCRACY.,"Thrilled, warmed, by turns, the listener's heart,"
182,DEMOCRACY.,
183,DEMOCRACY.,"In holy words which cannot die,"
184,DEMOCRACY.,"In thoughts which angels leaned to know,"
185,DEMOCRACY.,"Proclaimed thy message from on high,"
186,DEMOCRACY.,Thy mission to a world of woe.
187,DEMOCRACY.,
188,DEMOCRACY.,That voice's echo hath not died!
189,DEMOCRACY.,"From the blue lake of Galilee,"

192,DEMOCRACY.,
193,DEMOCRACY.,Thy name and watchword o'er this land
194,DEMOCRACY.,"I hear in every breeze that stirs,"

197,DEMOCRACY.,
198,DEMOCRACY.,"Not, to these altars of a day,"
199,DEMOCRACY.,"At party's call, my gift I bring;"
200,DEMOCRACY.,But on thy olden shrine I lay
201,DEMOCRACY.,A freeman's dearest offering.
202,DEMOCRACY.,
203,DEMOCRACY.,"The voiceless utterance of his will,--"
204,DEMOCRACY.,"His pledge to Freedom and to Truth,"

217,I.,I.
218,I.,THE suns of eighteen centuries have shone
219,I.,"Since the Redeemer walked with man, and made"
220,I.,"The fisher's boat, the cavern's floor of stone,"
221,I.,"And mountain moss, a pillow for His head;"
222,I.,"And He, who wandered with the peasant Jew,"
223,I.,"And broke with publicans the bread of shame,"
224,I.,"And drank with blessings, in His Father's name,"
225,I.,"The water which Samaria's outcast drew,"
226,I.,"Hath now His temples upon every shore,"
227,I.,Altar and shrine and priest; and incense dim

234,II.,"Yet as of old, when, meekly ""doing good,"""
235,II.,"He fed a blind and selfish multitude,"
236,II.,And even the poor companions of His lot
237,II.,"With their dim earthly vision knew Him not,"
238,II.,How ill are His high teachings understood
239,II.,"Where He hath spoken Liberty, the priest"
240,II.,At His own altar binds the chain anew;
241,II.,"Where He hath bidden to Life's equal feast,"
242,II.,The starving many wait upon the few;
243,II.,"Where He hath spoken Peace, His name hath been"
244,II.,The loudest war-cry of contending men;
245,II.,"Priests, pale with vigils, in His name have blessed"
246,II.,"The unsheathed sword, and laid the spear in rest,"
247,II.,"Wet the war-banner with their sacred wine,"
248,II.,And crossed its blazon with the holy sign;
249,II.,"Yea, in His name who bade the erring live,"
250,II.,"And daily taught His lesson, to forgive!"
251,II.,Twisted the cord and edged the murderous steel;
252,II.,"And, with His words of mercy on their lips,"
253,II.,"Hung gloating o'er the pincer's burning grips,"
254,II.,And the grim horror of the straining wheel;
255,II.,"Fed the slow flame which gnawed the victim's limb,"
256,II.,Who saw before his searing eyeballs swim
257,II.,"The image of their Christ in cruel zeal,"
258,II.,"Through the black torment-smoke, held mockingly to him!"
259,II.,
260,II.,
261,III.,III.
262,III.,"The blood which mingled with the desert sand,"
263,III.,And beaded with its red and ghastly dew
264,III.,The vines and olives of the Holy Land;
265,III.,The shrieking curses of the hunted Jew;
266,III.,"The white-sown bones of heretics, where'er"
267,III.,They sank beneath the Crusade's holy spear;
268,III.,"Goa's dark dungeons, Malta's sea-washed cell,"
269,III.,Where with the hymns the ghostly fathers sung
270,III.,"Mingled the groans by subtle torture wrung,"
271,III.,Heaven's anthem blending with the shriek of hell!
272,III.,"The midnight of Bartholomew, the stake"
273,III.,"Of Smithfield, and that thrice-accursed flame"
274,III.,Which Calvin kindled by Geneva's lake;
275,III.,"New England's scaffold, and the priestly sneer"
276,III.,"Which mocked its victims in that hour of fear,"
277,III.,"When guilt itself a human tear might claim,--"
278,III.,"Bear witness, O Thou wronged and merciful One!"
279,III.,That Earth's most hateful crimes have in Thy
280,III.,name been done!

282,III.,
283,IV.,IV.
284,IV.,Thank God! that I have lived to see the time
285,IV.,When the great truth begins at last to find
286,IV.,"An utterance from the deep heart of mankind,"
287,IV.,"Earnest and clear, that all Revenge is Crime,"
288,IV.,"That man is holier than a creed, that all"
289,IV.,"Restraint upon him must consult his good,"
290,IV.,"Hope's sunshine linger on his prison wall,"

292,IV.,The beautiful lesson which our Saviour taught
293,IV.,"Through long, dark centuries its way hath wrought"

295,IV.,"And words, to which by Galilee's lake shore"
296,IV.,"The humble fishers listened with hushed oar,"
297,IV.,"Have found an echo in the general heart,"
298,IV.,And of the public faith become a living part.

302,V.,Who shall arrest this tendency? Bring back
303,V.,The cells of Venice and the bigot's rack?
304,V.,Harden the softening human heart again
305,V.,To cold indifference to a brother's pain?
306,V.,"Ye most unhappy men! who, turned away"
307,V.,"From the mild sunshine of the Gospel day,"
308,V.,"Grope in the shadows of Man's twilight time,"
309,V.,"What mean ye, that with ghoul-like zest ye brood,"
310,V.,"O'er those foul altars streaming with warm blood,"
311,V.,Permitted in another age and clime?
312,V.,Why cite that law with which the bigot Jew
313,V.,"Rebuked the Pagan's mercy, when he knew"
314,V.,No evil in the Just One? Wherefore turn
315,V.,"To the dark, cruel past? Can ye not learn"
316,V.,From the pure Teacher's life how mildly free
317,V.,Is the great Gospel of Humanity?
318,V.,"The Flamen's knife is bloodless, and no more"
319,V.,"Mexitli's altars soak with human gore,"
320,V.,No more the ghastly sacrifices smoke
321,V.,Through the green arches of the Druid's oak;
322,V.,"And ye of milder faith, with your high claim"
323,V.,"Of prophet-utterance in the Holiest name,"
324,V.,Will ye become the Druids of our time
325,V.,"Set up your scaffold-altars in our land,"
326,V.,"And, consecrators of Law's darkest crime,"
327,V.,Urge to its loathsome work the hangman's hand?
328,V.,"Beware, lest human nature, roused at last,"
329,V.,"From its peeled shoulder your encumbrance cast,"
330,V.,"And, sick to loathing of your cry for blood,"
331,V.,Rank ye with those who led their victims round
332,V.,"The Celt's red altar and the Indian's mound,"

346,SEED-TIME AND HARVEST.,"Thus, Freedom, on the bitter blast"

355,SEED-TIME AND HARVEST.,
356,SEED-TIME AND HARVEST.,It may not be our lot to wield

371,SEED-TIME AND HARVEST.,"And were this life the utmost span,"
372,SEED-TIME AND HARVEST.,"The only end and aim of man,"
373,SEED-TIME AND HARVEST.,Better the toil of fields like these
374,SEED-TIME AND HARVEST.,Than waking dream and slothful ease.
375,SEED-TIME AND HARVEST.,
376,SEED-TIME AND HARVEST.,"But life, though falling like our grain,"

386,TO THE REFORMERS OF ENGLAND.,This poem was addressed to those who like Richard Cobden and John Bright
387,TO THE REFORMERS OF ENGLAND.,were seeking the reform of political evils in Great Britain by peaceful
388,TO THE REFORMERS OF ENGLAND.,and Christian means. It will be remembered that the Anti-Corn Law League

392,TO THE REFORMERS OF ENGLAND.,"Ye 're waging now, ye cannot fail,"
393,TO THE REFORMERS OF ENGLAND.,For better is your sense of right
394,TO THE REFORMERS OF ENGLAND.,Than king-craft's triple mail.
395,TO THE REFORMERS OF ENGLAND.,
396,TO THE REFORMERS OF ENGLAND.,"Than tyrant's law, or bigot's ban,"
397,TO THE REFORMERS OF ENGLAND.,More mighty is your simplest word;
398,TO THE REFORMERS OF ENGLAND.,The free heart of an honest man
399,TO THE REFORMERS OF ENGLAND.,Than crosier or the sword.

420,TO THE REFORMERS OF ENGLAND.,
421,TO THE REFORMERS OF ENGLAND.,The truths ye urge are borne abroad

434,TO THE REFORMERS OF ENGLAND.,Your steady faith in man.
435,TO THE REFORMERS OF ENGLAND.,
436,TO THE REFORMERS OF ENGLAND.,The languid pulse of England starts
437,TO THE REFORMERS OF ENGLAND.,"And bounds beneath your words of power,"

439,TO THE REFORMERS OF ENGLAND.,Is with you at this hour!
440,TO THE REFORMERS OF ENGLAND.,
441,TO THE REFORMERS OF ENGLAND.,"O ye who, with undoubting eyes,"

471,THE HUMAN SACRIFICE.,
472,THE HUMAN SACRIFICE.,Some leading sectarian papers had lately published the letter of a
473,THE HUMAN SACRIFICE.,"clergyman, giving an account of his attendance upon a criminal (who had"
474,THE HUMAN SACRIFICE.,"committed murder during a fit of intoxication), at the time of his"
475,THE HUMAN SACRIFICE.,"execution, in western New York. The writer describes the agony of the"
476,THE HUMAN SACRIFICE.,"wretched being, his abortive attempts at prayer, his appeal for life,"
477,THE HUMAN SACRIFICE.,"his fear of a violent death; and, after declaring his belief that the"
478,THE HUMAN SACRIFICE.,"poor victim died without hope of salvation, concludes with a warm eulogy"
479,THE HUMAN SACRIFICE.,"upon the gallows, being more than ever convinced of its utility by the"
480,THE HUMAN SACRIFICE.,awful dread and horror which it inspired.

482,I.,I.
483,I.,"FAR from his close and noisome cell,"
484,I.,"By grassy lane and sunny stream,"
485,I.,"Blown clover field and strawberry dell,"
486,I.,"And green and meadow freshness, fell"
487,I.,The footsteps of his dream.
488,I.,Again from careless feet the dew
489,I.,Of summer's misty morn he shook;
490,I.,Again with merry heart he threw
491,I.,His light line in the rippling brook.
492,I.,Back crowded all his school-day joys;
493,I.,"He urged the ball and quoit again,"
494,I.,And heard the shout of laughing boys
495,I.,Come ringing down the walnut glen.
496,I.,"Again he felt the western breeze,"
497,I.,With scent of flowers and crisping hay;
498,I.,And down again through wind-stirred trees
499,I.,He saw the quivering sunlight play.
500,I.,"An angel in home's vine-hung door,"
501,I.,He saw his sister smile once more;
502,I.,Once more the truant's brown-locked head
503,I.,"Upon his mother's knees was laid,"
504,I.,"And sweetly lulled to slumber there,"
505,I.,With evening's holy hymn and prayer!
506,I.,
507,II.,II.
508,II.,He woke. At once on heart and brain
509,II.,The present Terror rushed again;
510,II.,Clanked on his limbs the felon's chain
511,II.,"He woke, to hear the church-tower tell"
512,II.,"Time's footfall on the conscious bell,"
513,II.,"And, shuddering, feel that clanging din"
514,II.,His life's last hour had ushered in;
515,II.,"To see within his prison-yard,"
516,II.,"Through the small window, iron barred,"
517,II.,The gallows shadow rising dim
518,II.,Between the sunrise heaven and him;
519,II.,A horror in God's blessed air;
520,II.,A blackness in his morning light;
521,II.,Like some foul devil-altar there
522,II.,Built up by demon hands at night.
523,II.,"And, maddened by that evil sight,"
524,II.,"Dark, horrible, confused, and strange,"
525,II.,"A chaos of wild, weltering change,"

531,II.,Creak as the wind its timbers shook.
532,II.,"No dream for him of sin forgiven,"

545,III.,"Is measured out by rule and book,"
546,III.,"With placid lip and tranquil blood,"

552,III.,

554,IV.,"He saw the victim's tortured brow,"
555,IV.,"The sweat of anguish starting there,"
556,IV.,The record of a nameless woe
557,IV.,"In the dim eye's imploring stare,"
558,IV.,"Seen hideous through the long, damp hair,--"
559,IV.,Fingers of ghastly skin and bone
560,IV.,Working and writhing on the stone!
561,IV.,"And heard, by mortal terror wrung"
562,IV.,"From heaving breast and stiffened tongue,"
563,IV.,The choking sob and low hoarse prayer;
564,IV.,As o'er his half-crazed fancy came
565,IV.,"A vision of the eternal flame,"
566,IV.,"Its smoking cloud of agonies,"
567,IV.,"Its demon-worm that never dies,"
568,IV.,The everlasting rise and fall
569,IV.,Of fire-waves round the infernal wall;
570,IV.,"While high above that dark red flood,"
571,IV.,"Black, giant-like, the gallows stood;"
572,IV.,Two busy fiends attending there
573,IV.,"One with cold mocking rite and prayer,"

577,V.,V.
578,V.,"The unfelt rite at length was done,"

582,V.,"And he who stood the doomed beside,"
583,V.,Calm gauger of the swelling tide
584,V.,"Of mortal agony and fear,"
585,V.,Heeding with curious eye and ear
586,V.,Whate'er revealed the keen excess
587,V.,Of man's extremest wretchedness
588,V.,And who in that dark anguish saw
589,V.,"An earnest of the victim's fate,"
590,V.,"The vengeful terrors of God's law,"
591,V.,"The kindlings of Eternal hate,"
592,V.,The first drops of that fiery rain
593,V.,"Which beats the dark red realm of pain,"
594,V.,Did he uplift his earnest cries
595,V.,"Against the crime of Law, which gave"
596,V.,"His brother to that fearful grave,"
597,V.,"Whereon Hope's moonlight never lies,"
598,V.,And Faith's white blossoms never wave
599,V.,To the soft breath of Memory's sighs;
600,V.,"Which sent a spirit marred and stained,"
601,V.,"By fiends of sin possessed, profaned,"
602,V.,"In madness and in blindness stark,"
603,V.,"Into the silent, unknown dark?"
604,V.,"No, from the wild and shrinking dread,"
605,V.,With which be saw the victim led
606,V.,Beneath the dark veil which divides
607,V.,"Ever the living from the dead,"
608,V.,"And Nature's solemn secret hides,"
609,V.,The man of prayer can only draw
610,V.,New reasons for his bloody law;
611,V.,New faith in staying Murder's hand
612,V.,By murder at that Law's command;
613,V.,"New reverence for the gallows-rope,"
614,V.,As human nature's latest hope;
615,V.,"Last relic of the good old time,"
616,V.,"When Power found license for its crime,"
617,V.,And held a writhing world in check
618,V.,By that fell cord about its neck;
619,V.,"Stifled Sedition's rising shout,"
620,V.,"Choked the young breath of Freedom out,"
621,V.,And timely checked the words which sprung
622,V.,From Heresy's forbidden tongue;
623,V.,"While in its noose of terror bound,"
624,V.,"The Church its cherished union found,"
625,V.,"Conforming, on the Moslem plan,"

637,VI.,A brother's face of tenderest love;
638,VI.,"Thou, unto whom the blind and lame,"

640,VI.,And from Thy very garment's hem
641,VI.,"Drew life and healing unto them,"
642,VI.,The burden of Thy holy faith
643,VI.,"Was love and life, not hate and death;"
644,VI.,"Man's demon ministers of pain,"
645,VI.,"The fiends of his revenge, were sent"
646,VI.,From thy pure Gospel's element
647,VI.,To their dark home again.

649,VI.,"Who in that name the gallows rears,"

1348,THE HUSKERS.,Had left the summer harvest-fields all green with grass again;
1349,THE HUSKERS.,"The first sharp frosts had fallen, leaving all the woodlands gay"
1350,THE HUSKERS.,"With the hues of summer's rainbow, or the meadow-flowers of May."
1351,THE HUSKERS.,
1352,THE HUSKERS.,"Through a thin, dry mist, that morning, the sun rose broad and red,"
1353,THE HUSKERS.,"At first a rayless disk of fire, he brightened as he sped;"
1354,THE HUSKERS.,"Yet, even his noontide glory fell chastened and subdued,"
1355,THE HUSKERS.,"On the cornfields and the orchards, and softly pictured wood."
1356,THE HUSKERS.,
1357,THE HUSKERS.,"And all that quiet afternoon, slow sloping to the night,"
1358,THE HUSKERS.,He wove with golden shuttle the haze with yellow light;
1359,THE HUSKERS.,"Slanting through the painted beeches, he glorified the hill;"
1360,THE HUSKERS.,"And, beneath it, pond and meadow lay brighter, greener still."
1361,THE HUSKERS.,
1362,THE HUSKERS.,"And shouting boys in woodland haunts caught glimpses of that sky,"
1363,THE HUSKERS.,"Flecked by the many-tinted leaves, and laughed, they knew not why;"
1364,THE HUSKERS.,"And school-girls, gay with aster-flowers, beside the meadow brooks,"
1365,THE HUSKERS.,Mingled the glow of autumn with the sunshine of sweet looks.
1366,THE HUSKERS.,
1367,THE HUSKERS.,From spire and barn looked westerly the patient weathercocks;
1368,THE HUSKERS.,But even the birches on the hill stood motionless as rocks.
1369,THE HUSKERS.,"No sound was in the woodlands, save the squirrel's dropping shell,"
1370,THE HUSKERS.,"And the yellow leaves among the boughs, low rustling as they fell."
1371,THE HUSKERS.,
1372,THE HUSKERS.,"The summer grains were harvested; the stubble-fields lay dry,"
1373,THE HUSKERS.,"Where June winds rolled, in light and shade, the pale green waves of rye;"
1374,THE HUSKERS.,"But still, on gentle hill-slopes, in valleys fringed with wood,"
1375,THE HUSKERS.,"Ungathered, bleaching in the sun, the heavy corn crop stood."
1376,THE HUSKERS.,
1377,THE HUSKERS.,"Bent low, by autumn's wind and rain, through husks that, dry and sere,"
1378,THE HUSKERS.,"Unfolded from their ripened charge, shone out the yellow ear;"
1379,THE HUSKERS.,"Beneath, the turnip lay concealed, in many a verdant fold,"
1380,THE HUSKERS.,And glistened in the slanting light the pumpkin's sphere of gold.
1381,THE HUSKERS.,
1382,THE HUSKERS.,There wrought the busy harvesters; and many a creaking wain
1383,THE HUSKERS.,Bore slowly to the long barn-floor its load of husk and grain;
1384,THE HUSKERS.,"Till broad and red, as when he rose, the sun sank down, at last,"
1385,THE HUSKERS.,"And like a merry guest's farewell, the day in brightness passed."
1386,THE HUSKERS.,
1387,THE HUSKERS.,"And to! as through the western pines, on meadow, stream, and pond,"
1388,THE HUSKERS.,"Flamed the red radiance of a sky, set all afire beyond,"
1389,THE HUSKERS.,"Slowly o'er the eastern sea-bluffs a milder glory shone,"
1390,THE HUSKERS.,And the sunset and the moonrise were mingled into one!
1391,THE HUSKERS.,
1392,THE HUSKERS.,"As thus into the quiet night the twilight lapsed away,"
1393,THE HUSKERS.,And deeper in the brightening moon the tranquil shadows lay;
1394,THE HUSKERS.,"From many a brown old farm-house, and hamlet without name,"
1395,THE HUSKERS.,"Their milking and their home-tasks done, the  merry huskers came."
1396,THE HUSKERS.,
1397,THE HUSKERS.,"Swung o'er the heaped-up harvest, from pitchforks in the mow,"
1398,THE HUSKERS.,Shone dimly down the lanterns on the pleasant scene below;
1399,THE HUSKERS.,"The growing pile of husks behind, the golden ears before,"
1400,THE HUSKERS.,And laughing eyes and busy hands and brown cheeks glimmering o'er.
1401,THE HUSKERS.,
1402,THE HUSKERS.,"Half hidden, in a quiet nook, serene of look and heart,"
1403,THE HUSKERS.,"Talking their old times over, the old men sat apart;"
1404,THE HUSKERS.,"While up and down the unhusked pile, or nestling in its shade,"
1405,THE HUSKERS.,"At hide-and-seek, with laugh and shout, the happy children played."
1406,THE HUSKERS.,
1407,THE HUSKERS.,"Urged by the good host's daughter, a maiden young and fair,"
1408,THE HUSKERS.,"Lifting to light her sweet blue eyes and pride of soft brown hair,"
1409,THE HUSKERS.,"The master of the village school, sleek of hair and smooth of tongue,"
