16,I.,I. 
17,I.,"Steadfast as any soldier of the line He served his England, with the imminent death Poised at his heart. Nor could the world divine The constant peril of each burdened breath. "
18,I.,"England, and the honour of England, he still served Walking the strict path, with the old high pride Of those invincible knights who never swerved One hair's breadth from the way until they died. "
19,I.,"Quietness he loved, and books, and the grave beauty Of England's Helicon, whose eternal light Shines like a lantern on that road of duty, Discerned by few in this chaotic night. "
20,I.,"And his own pen, foretelling his release, Told us that he foreknew ""the end was peace."" "
21,II.,II. 
22,II.,"Soldier of England, he shall live unsleeping Among his friends, with the old proud flag above; For even today her honour is in his keeping. He has joined the hosts that guard her with their love. "
23,II.,"They shine like stars, unnumbered happy legions, In that high realm where all our darkness dies. He moves, with honour, in those loftier regions, Above this ""world of passion and of lies"": "
24,II.,"For so he called it, keeping his own pure passion A silent flame before the true and good; Not fawning on the throng in this world's fashion To come and see what all might see who would. "
25,II.,"Soldier of England, brave and gentle knight, The soul of Sidney welcomes you tonight. "

93,"""THE AVENUE OF THE ALLIES""","""THE AVENUE OF THE ALLIES"" "
94,"""THE AVENUE OF THE ALLIES""",This is the song of the wind as it came Tossing the flags of the nations to flame: 
95,"""THE AVENUE OF THE ALLIES""",_I am the breath of God. I am His laughter. I am His Liberty. That is my name._ 
96,"""THE AVENUE OF THE ALLIES""","So it descended, at night, on the city. So it went lavishing beauty and pity, Lighting the lordliest street of the world With half of the banners that earth has unfurled; Over the lamps that are brighter than stars. Laughing aloud on its way to the wars, Proud as America, sweeping along Death and destruction like notes in a song, Leaping to battle as man to his mate, Joyous as God when he moved to create,-- Never was voice of a nation so glorious, Glad of its cause and afire with its fate! Never did eagle on mightier pinion Tower to the height of a brighter dominion, Kindling the hope of the prophets to flame, Calling aloud on the deep as it came, "
97,"""THE AVENUE OF THE ALLIES""",_Cleave me a way for an army with banners. I am His Liberty. That is my name._ 
98,"""THE AVENUE OF THE ALLIES""","Know you the meaning of all they are doing? Know you the light that their soul is pursuing? Know you the might of the world they are making, This nation of nations whose heart is awaking? What is this mingling of peoples and races? Look at the wonder and joy in their faces! Look how the folds of the union are spreading! Look, for the nations are come to their wedding. How shall the folk of our tongue be afraid of it? England was born of it. England was made of it, Made of this welding of tribes into one, This marriage of pilgrims that followed the sun! Briton and Roman and Saxon were drawn By winds of this Pentecost, out of the dawn, Westward, to make her one people of many; But here is a union more mighty than any. Know you the soul of this deep exultation? Know you the word that goes forth to this nation? "
99,"""THE AVENUE OF THE ALLIES""",_I am the breath of God. I am His Liberty. Let there be light over all His creation._ 
100,"""THE AVENUE OF THE ALLIES""","Over this Continent, wholly united, They that were foemen in Europe are plighted. Here, in a league that our blindness and pride Doubted and flouted and mocked and denied, Dawns the Republic, the laughing, gigantic Europe, united, beyond the Atlantic. That is America, speaking one tongue, Acting her epics before they are sung, Driving her rails from the palms to the snow, Through States that are greater than Emperors know, Forty-eight States that are empires in might, But ruled by the will of one people tonight, Nerved as one body, with net-works of steel, Merging their strength in the one Commonweal, Brooking no poverty, mocking at Mars, Building their cities to talk with the stars. Thriving, increasing by myriads again Till even in numbers old Europe may wane. How shall a son of the England they fought Fail to declare the full pride of his thought, Stand with the scoffers who, year after year, Bring the Republic their half-hidden sneer? Now, as in beauty she stands at our side, Who shall withhold the full gift of his pride? Not the great England who knows that her son, Washington, fought her, and Liberty won. England, whose names like the stars in their station, Stand at the foot of that world's Declaration,-- Washington, Livingston, Langdon, she claims them, It is her right to be proud when she names them, Proud of that voice in the night as it came, Tossing the flags of the nations to flame: "
101,"""THE AVENUE OF THE ALLIES""",_I am the breath of God. I am His laughter. I am His Liberty. That is my name._ 
102,"""THE AVENUE OF THE ALLIES""","Flags, in themselves, are but rags that are dyed. Flags, in that wind, are like nations enskied. See, how they grapple the night as it rolls And trample it under like triumphing souls. Over the city that never knew sleep, Look at the riotous folds as they leap. Thousands of tri-colors, laughing for France, Ripple and whisper and thunder and dance; Thousands of flags for Great Britain aflame Answer their sisters in Liberty's name. Belgium is burning in pride overhead. Poland is near, and her sunrise is red. Under and over, and fluttering between, Italy burgeons in red, white, and green. See, how they climb like adventurous flowers, Over the tops of the terrible towers.... _There, in the darkness, the glories are mated. There, in the darkness, a world is created. There, in this Pentecost, streaming on high. There, with a glory of stars in the sky. There the broad flag of our union and liberty Rides the proud night-wind and tyrannies die._ "
103,ON THE WESTERN FRONT,ON THE WESTERN FRONT (_1916_) 
104,I.,I. 
105,I.,"I found a dreadful acre of the dead, Marked with the only sign on earth that saves. The wings of death were hurrying overhead, The loose earth shook on those unquiet graves; "
106,I.,"For the deep gun-pits, with quick stabs of flame, Made their own thunders of the sunlit air; Yet, as I read the crosses, name by name, _Mort pour la France_, it seemed that peace was there; Sunlight and peace, a peace too deep for thought, The peace of tides that underlie our strife, The peace with which the moving heavens are fraught, The peace that is our everlasting life. "
107,I.,The loose earth shook. The very hills were stirred. The silence of the dead was all I heard. 
108,II.,II. 
109,II.,"We, who lie here, have nothing more to pray. To all your praises we are deaf and blind. We may not even know if you betray Our hope, to make earth better for mankind. "
110,II.,"Only our silence, in the night, shall grow More silent, as the stars grow in the sky; And, while you deck our graves, you shall not know How many scornful legions pass you by. "
111,II.,"For we have heard you say (when we were living) That some small dream of good would ""cost too much."" But when the foe struck, we have watched you giving, And seen you move the mountains with one touch. "
112,II.,"What can be done, we know. But, have no fear! If you fail now, we shall not see or hear. "
113,VICTORY,VICTORY 
114,VICTORY,"(Written after the British Service at Trinity Church, New York) "
115,I.,I. 
116,I.,"Before those golden altar-lights we stood, Each one of us remembering his own dead. A more than earthly beauty seemed to brood On that hushed throng, and bless each bending head. "
117,I.,"Beautiful on that gold, the deep-sea blue Of those young seamen, ranked on either side, Blent with the khaki, while the silence grew Deep, as for wings--Oh, deep as England's pride. "
118,I.,"Beautiful on that gold, two banners rose-- Two flags that told how Freedom's realm was made, One fair with stars of hope, and one that shows The glorious cross of England's long crusade; "
119,I.,"Two flags, now joined, till that high will be done Which sent them forth to make the whole world one. "
120,II.,II. 
121,II.,There were no signs of joy that eyes could see. Our hearts were all three thousand miles away. There were no trumpets blown for victory. A million dead were calling us that day. 
122,II.,"And eyes grew blind, at times; but grief was deep, Deeper than any foes or friends have known; For Oh, my country's lips are locked to keep Her bitterest loss her own, and all her own. "
123,II.,"Only the music told what else was dumb, The funeral march to which our pulses beat; For all our dead went by, to a muffled drum We heard the tread of all those phantom feet. "
124,II.,Yes. There was victory! Deep in every soul. We heard them marching to their unseen goal. 
125,III.,III. 
126,III.,"There, once again, we saw the Cross go by, The Cross that fell with all those glorious towers, Burnt black in France or mocked on Calvary, Till--in one night--the crosses rose like flowers, Legions of small white crosses, mile on mile, Pencilled with names that had outfought all pain, Where every shell-torn acre seems to smile-- _Who shall destroy the cross that rose again?_ "
127,III.,"Out of the world's Walpurgis, where hope perished, Where all the forms of faith in ruin fell, Where every sign of heaven that earth had cherished Shrivelled among the lava-floods of hell, "
128,III.,The eternal Cross that conquers might with right Rose like a star to lead us through the night. 
129,IV.,IV. 
130,IV.,"How shall the world remember? Men forget: Our dead are all too many even for Fame! Man's justice kneels to kings, and pays no debt To those who never courted her acclaim. "
131,IV.,"Cheat not your heart with promises to pay For gifts beyond all price so freely given. Where is the heart so rich that it can say To those who mourn, ""I will restore your heaven""? "
132,IV.,"But these, with their own hands, laid up their treasure Where never an emperor can break in and steal, Treasure for those that loved them past all measure In those high griefs that earth can never heal, "
133,IV.,"Proud griefs, that walk on earth, yet gaze above, Knowing that sorrow is but remembered love. "
134,V.,V. 
135,V.,"Love that still holds us with immortal power, Yet cannot lift us to His realm of light; Love that still shows us heaven for one brief hour Only to daunt the heart with that sheer height; "
136,V.,"Love that is made of loveliness entire In form and thought and act; and still must shame us Because we ever acknowledge and aspire, And yet let slip the shining hands that claim us. "
137,V.,"O, if this Love might cloak with rags His glory, Laugh, eat and drink, and dwell with suffering men, Sit with us at our hearth, and hear our story, This world--we thought--might be transfigured then. "
138,V.,"""But Oh,"" Love answered, with swift human tears, ""All these things have I done, these many years."" "
139,VI.,VI. 
140,VI.,"""This day,"" Love said, ""if ye will hear my voice; I mount and sing with birds in all your skies. I am the soul that calls you to rejoice. And every wayside flower is my disguise. "
141,VI.,"""Look closely. Are the wings too wide for pity? Look closely. Do these tender hues betray? How often have I sought my Holy City? How often have ye turned your hearts away? "
142,VI.,"""Is there not healing in the beauty I bring you? Am I not whispering in green leaves and rain, Singing in all that woods and seas can sing you? Look, once, on Love, and earth is heaven again. "
143,VI.,"""O, did your Spring but once a century waken, The heaven of heavens for this would be forsaken."" "
144,VII.,VII. 
145,VII.,"There's but one gift that all our dead desire, One gift that men can give, and that's a dream, Unless we, too, can burn with that same fire Of sacrifice; die to the things that seem; "
146,VII.,"Die to the little hatreds; die to greed; Die to the old ignoble selves we knew; Die to the base contempts of sect and creed, And rise again, like these, with souls as true. "
147,VII.,"Nay (since these died before their task was finished) Attempt new heights, bring even their dreams to birth:-- Build us that better world, Oh, not diminished By one true splendor that they planned on earth. "
148,VII.,"And that's not done by sword, or tongue, or pen, There's but one way. God make us better men. "

150,REPUBLIC AND MOTHERLAND,REPUBLIC AND MOTHERLAND (_1912_) 
151,REPUBLIC AND MOTHERLAND,(Written after entering New York Harbor at Daybreak) 
152,REPUBLIC AND MOTHERLAND,"Up the vast harbor with the morning sun The ship swept in from sea; Gigantic towers arose, the night was done, And--there stood Liberty. "
153,REPUBLIC AND MOTHERLAND,"Silent, the great torch lifted in one hand, The dawn in her proud eyes, Silent, for all the shouts that vex her land, Silent, hailing the skies; "
154,REPUBLIC AND MOTHERLAND,"Hailing that mightier Kingdom of the Blest Our seamen sought of old, The dream that lured the nations through the West, The city of sunset gold. "
155,REPUBLIC AND MOTHERLAND,"Saxon and Norman in one wedded soul Shook out one flag like fire; But westward, westward, moved the gleaming goal, Westward, the vast desire. "
156,REPUBLIC AND MOTHERLAND,"Westward and ever westward ran the call, They followed the pilgrim sun, Seeking that land which should enfold them all, And weld all hearts in one. "
157,REPUBLIC AND MOTHERLAND,"Here on this mightier continent apart, Here on these rolling plains, Swells the first throb of that immortal heart, The pulse of those huge veins. "
158,REPUBLIC AND MOTHERLAND,"Still, at these towers, our Old-World cities jest, And neither hear nor see The brood of gods at that gigantic breast, The conquering race to be. "
159,REPUBLIC AND MOTHERLAND,"Chosen from many--for no sluggard soul Confronts that night of stars-- The trumpets of the last Republic roll Far off, an end to wars; "
160,REPUBLIC AND MOTHERLAND,"An end, an end to that wild blood-red age, That made and keeps us blind; A mightier realm shall be her heritage, The kingdom of mankind. "
161,REPUBLIC AND MOTHERLAND,"Chosen from many nations, and made one; But first, O Mother, from thee, When, following, following on that Pilgrim sun, Thy Mayflower crossed the sea. "
162,THE UNION,THE UNION (_1917_) 
163,THE UNION,"You that have gathered together the sons of all races, And welded them into one, Lifting the torch of your Freedom on hungering faces That sailed to the setting sun; "
164,THE UNION,"You that have made of mankind in your own proud regions The music of man to be, How should the old earth sing of you, now, as your legions Rise to set all men free? "
165,THE UNION,"How should the singer that knew the proud vision and loved it, In the days when not all men knew, Gaze through his tears, on the light, now the world has approved it; Or dream, when the dream comes true? "
166,THE UNION,"How should he sing when the Spirit of Freedom in thunder Speaks, and the wine-press is red; And the sea-winds are loud with the chains that are broken asunder And nations that rise from the dead? "
167,THE UNION,"Flag of the sky, proud flag of that wide communion, Too mighty for thought to scan; Flag of the many in one, and that last world-union That kingdom of God in man; "
168,THE UNION,"Ours was a dream, in the night, of that last federation, But yours is the glory unfurled-- The marshalled nations and stars that shall make one nation One singing star of the world. "

171,GHOSTS OF THE NEW WORLD,"There are no ghosts, you say, To haunt her blaze of light; No shadows in her day, No phantoms in her night. Columbus' tattered sail Has passed beyond our hail. "
172,GHOSTS OF THE NEW WORLD,"What? On that magic coast, Where Raleigh fought with fate, Or where that Devon ghost Unbarred the Golden Gate, No dark, strange, ear-ringed men Beat in from sea again? "
173,GHOSTS OF THE NEW WORLD,"No ghosts in Salem town With silver buckled shoon? No lovely witch to drown Or burn beneath the moon? Not even a whiff of tea, On Boston's glimmering quay. "
174,GHOSTS OF THE NEW WORLD,"O, ghostly Spanish walls, Where brown Franciscans glide, Is there no voice that calls Across the Great Divide, To pilgrims on their way Along the Santa Fe? "
175,GHOSTS OF THE NEW WORLD,"Then let your Pullman cars Go roaring to the West, Till, watched by lonelier stars, The cactus lifts its crest. There, on that painted plain, One ghost will rise again. "
176,GHOSTS OF THE NEW WORLD,"Majestic and forlorn, Wreck of a dying race, The Red Man, half in scorn, Shall raise his haughty face, Inscrutable as the sky, To watch our ghosts go by. "
177,GHOSTS OF THE NEW WORLD,"What? Is earth dreaming still? Shall not the night disgorge The ghosts of Bunker Hill The ghosts of Valley Forge, Or, England's mightiest son, The ghost of Washington? "
178,GHOSTS OF THE NEW WORLD,No ghosts where Lincoln fell? No ghosts for seeing eyes? I know an old cracked bell Shall make ten million rise When one immortal ghost Calls to the slumbering host. 
179,THE OLD MEETING HOUSE,THE OLD MEETING HOUSE 
180,THE OLD MEETING HOUSE,"(_New Jersey, 1918_) "
181,THE OLD MEETING HOUSE,"Its quiet graves were made for peace till Gabriel blows his horn. Those wise old elms could hear no cry Of all that distant agony-- Only the red-winged blackbird, and the rustle of thick ripe corn. "
182,THE OLD MEETING HOUSE,"The blue jay, perched upon that bronze, with bright unweeting eyes, Could never read the names that signed The noblest charter of mankind; But all of them were names we knew beneath our English skies. "
183,THE OLD MEETING HOUSE,"And on the low gray headstones, with their crumbling weather-stains, --Though cardinal birds, like drops of blood, Flickered across the haunted wood,-- The names you'd see were names that woke like flowers in English lanes. "
184,THE OLD MEETING HOUSE,"John Applegate was fast asleep; and Temperance Olden, too. And David Worth had quite forgot If Hannah's lips were red or not; And Prudence veiled her eyes at last, as Prudence ought to do. "
185,THE OLD MEETING HOUSE,"And when, across that patch of heaven, that small blue leaf-edged space At times, a droning airplane went, No flicker of astonishment Could lift the heavy eyelids on one gossip's up-turned face. "
186,THE OLD MEETING HOUSE,"For William Speakman could not tell--so thick the grasses grow-- If that strange humming in the sky Meant that the Judgment Day were nigh, Or if 'twas but the summer bees that blundered to and fro. "
187,THE OLD MEETING HOUSE,"And then, across the breathless wood, a Bell began to sound, The only Bell that wakes the dead, And Stockton Signer raised his head, And called to all the deacons in the ancient burial-ground. "
188,THE OLD MEETING HOUSE,"""The Bell, the Bell is ringing! Give me back my rusty sword. Though I thought the wars were done, Though I thought our peace was won, Yet I signed the Declaration, and the dead must keep their word. "
189,THE OLD MEETING HOUSE,"""There's only one great ghost I know could make that 'larum ring. It's the captain that we knew In the ancient buff and blue, It's our Englishman, George Washington, who fought the German king!"" "
190,THE OLD MEETING HOUSE,"So the sunset saw them mustering beneath their brooding boughs, Ancient shadows of our sires, Kindling with the ancient fires, While the old cracked Bell to southward shook the ancient meeting house. "
191,PRINCETON,PRINCETON (_1917_) 
192,PRINCETON,The first four lines of this poem were written for inscription on the first joint memorial to the American and British soldiers who fell in the Revolutionary War. This memorial was recently dedicated at Princeton. 
193,I.,I. 
194,I.,"_Here Freedom stood, by slaughtered friend and foe, And ere the wrath paled or that sunset died, Looked through the ages: then, with eyes aglow, Laid them, to wait that future, side by side._ "
195,II.,II. 
196,II.,"Now lamp-lit gardens in the blue dusk shine Through dog-wood red and white, And round the gray quadrangles, line by line, The windows fill with light, Where Princeton calls to Magdalen, tower to tower, Twin lanthorns of the law, And those cream-white magnolia boughs embower The halls of old Nassau. "
197,III.,III. 
198,III.,"The dark bronze tigers crouch on either side Where red-coats used to pass, And round the bird-loved house where Mercer died And violets dusk the grass, By Stony Brook that ran so red of old, But sings of friendship now, To feed the old enemy's harvest fifty-fold The green earth takes the plough. "
199,IV.,IV. 
200,IV.,"Through this May night if one great ghost should stray With deep remembering eyes, Where that old meadow of battle smiles away Its blood-stained memories, If Washington should walk, where friend and foe Sleep and forget the past, Be sure his unquenched heart would leap to know Their hosts are joined at last. "
201,V.,V. 
202,V.,"Be sure he walks, in shadowy buff and blue, Where those dim lilacs wave, He bends his head to bless, as dreams come true, The promise of that grave, Then with a vaster hope than thought can scan, Touching his ancient sword, Prays for that mightier realm of God in man, ""Hasten Thy Kingdom, Lord."" "
203,VI.,VI. 
204,VI.,"""Land of new hope, land of the singing stars, Type of the world to be, The vision of a world set free from wars Takes life, takes form, from thee, Where all the jarring nations of this earth, Beneath the all-blessing sun, Bring the new music of mankind to birth, And make the whole world one."" "
205,VII.,VII. 
206,VII.,"And those old comrades rise around him there, Old foemen, side by side, With eyes like stars upon the brave night-air, And young as when they died, To hear your bells, O beautiful Princeton towers, Ring for the world's release. They see you, piercing like gray swords through flowers, And smile from hearts at peace. "

208,BEETHOVEN IN CENTRAL PARK,"(After a glimpse of a certain monument in New York, during the Victory Celebration) "
209,BEETHOVEN IN CENTRAL PARK,"The thousand-windowed towers were all alight. Throngs of all nations filled that glittering way; And, rich with dreams of the approaching day, Flags of all nations trampled down the night. No clouds, at sunset, die in airs as bright. No clouds, at dawn, awake in winds as gay; For Freedom rose in that august array, Crowned with the stars and weaponed for the right. "
210,BEETHOVEN IN CENTRAL PARK,"Then, in a place of whispering leaves and gloom, I saw, too dark, too dumb for bronze or stone, One tragic head that bowed against the sky; O, in a hush too deep for any tomb I saw Beethoven, dreadfully alone With his own grief, and his own majesty. "

212,THE PEOPLE'S FLEET,THE PEOPLE'S FLEET 
213,THE PEOPLE'S FLEET,"Out of her darkened fishing-ports they go, A fleet of little ships, whose every name-- _Daffodil_, _Sea-lark_, _Rose_ and _Surf_ and _Snow_, Burns in this blackness like an altar-flame; "
214,THE PEOPLE'S FLEET,"Out of her past they sail, three thousand strong, The people's fleet that never knew its worth, And every name is a broken phrase of song To some remembered loveliness on earth. "
215,THE PEOPLE'S FLEET,"There's _Barbara Cowie_, _Comely Bank_ and _May_, Christened, at home, in worlds of dawn and dew: There's _Ruth_ and _Kindly Light_ and _Robin Gray_ With _Mizpah_. (May that simple prayer come true!) "
216,THE PEOPLE'S FLEET,"Out of old England's inmost heart they sail, A fleet of memories that can never fail. "
217,KILMENY,KILMENY 
218,KILMENY,"Dark, dark lay the drifters against the red West, As they shot their long meshes of steel overside; And the oily green waters were rocking to rest When Kilmeny went out, at the turn of the tide; And nobody knew where that lassie would roam, For the magic that called her was tapping unseen. It was well-nigh a week ere Kilmeny came home, And nobody knew where Kilmeny had been. "
219,KILMENY,"She'd a gun at her bow that was Newcastle's best, And a gun at her stern that was fresh from the Clyde, And a secret her skipper had never confessed, Not even at dawn, to his newly-wed bride; And a wireless that whispered above, like a gnome, The laughter of London, the boasts of Berlin.... O, it may have been mermaids that lured her from home; But nobody knew where Kilmeny had been. "
220,KILMENY,"It was dark when Kilmeny came home from her quest With her bridge dabbled red where her skipper had died; But she moved like a bride with a rose at her breast, And _Well done Kilmeny!_ the Admiral cried. "
221,KILMENY,"Now, at sixty-four fathom a conger may come And nose at the bones of a drowned submarine; But--late in the evening Kilmeny came home, And nobody knew where Kilmeny had been. "
222,KILMENY,"There's a wandering shadow that stares at the foam, Though they sing all the night to old England, their queen. Late, late in the evening, Kilmeny came home; And nobody knew where Kilmeny had been. "
223,CAP'N STORM-ALONG,CAP'N STORM-ALONG 
224,CAP'N STORM-ALONG,"They are buffeting out in the bitter grey weather, _Blow the man down, bullies, blow the man down!_ _Sea-lark_ singing to _Golden Feather_, And burly blue waters all swelling aroun'. There's _Thunderstone_ butting ahead as they wallow, With death in the mesh of their deep-sea trawl; There's _Night-Hawk_ swooping by wild _Sea-swallow_; And old Cap'n Storm-along leading 'em all. "
225,CAP'N STORM-ALONG,"_Bashing the seas to a welter of white, Look at the fleet that he leads to the fight. O, they're dancing like witches to open the ball; And old Cap'n Storm-along's lord of 'em all._ "
226,CAP'N STORM-ALONG,"Now, where have you seen such a bully old sailor? His eyes are as blue as the scarf at his throat; And he rolls on the bridge of his broad-beamed whaler, In yellow sou'wester and oil-skin coat. In trawler and drifter, in dinghy and dory, Wherever he signals, they leap to his call; They batter the seas to a lather of glory, With old Cap'n Storm-along leading 'em all. "
227,CAP'N STORM-ALONG,"_You'll find he's from Devon, the sailor I mean, Look at his whaler now, shipping it green. O, Fritz and his ""U"" boat must crab it and crawl When old Cap'n Storm-along sails to the ball._ "
228,CAP'N STORM-ALONG,"Ay, there is the skipper that knows how to scare 'em. _Blow the man down, bullies, blow the man down!_ Look at the sea-wives he keeps in his harem, Wicked young merry-maids, buxom and brown: There's _Rosalind_, the sea-witch, and _Gipsy_ so lissom, All dancing like ducks in the teeth of the squall, With a bright eye for Huns, and a Hotchkiss to kiss 'em; For old Cap'n Storm-along's lord of 'em all. "
229,CAP'N STORM-ALONG,"_Look at him, battering darkness to light! Look at the fleet that he leads to the fight! O, hearts that are mighty, in ships that are small, Your old Cap'n Storm-along's lord of us all._ "

231,THE BIG BLACK TRAWLER,"The very best ship that ever I knew, --_Ah-way O, to me O_-- Was a big black trawler with a deep-sea crew-- _Sing, my bullies, let the bullgine run._ "
232,THE BIG BLACK TRAWLER,"There was one old devil with a broken nose --_Ah-way O, to me O_-- He was four score years, as I suppose-- _But, sing, my bullies, let the bullgine run._ "
233,THE BIG BLACK TRAWLER,"We was wrecked last March, in a Polar storm --_Ah-way O, to me O_-- And we asked the old cripple if his feet was warm-- _Sing, my bullies, let the bullgine run._ "
234,THE BIG BLACK TRAWLER,"And the old, old devil (he was ninety at the most) --_Ah-way O, to me O_-- Roars, ""Ay, warm as a lickle piece of toast""-- _So sing, my bullies, let the bullgine run._ "
235,THE BIG BLACK TRAWLER,"""For I soaked my sea-boots and my dungarees --_Ah-way O, to me O_-- In the good salt water that the Lord don't freeze""-- _Oh, sing, my bullies, let the bullgine run._ "

That name is my own. _Fare you well, my sailor._ They sang in the dark, ""Let her go! Let her go!"" And she sailed to the West, where the broad waters flow; And the others come back, but ... the bitter winds blow. _Ah, fare you well, my sailor._ "
238,NAMESAKES,"The women, at evening, they wave and they cheer. --_Roll and go, and fare you well_-- They're waiting to welcome their lads at the pier. _Fare you well, my sailor._ They're all coming home in the twilight below; But there's one little boat.... Let her go! Let her go! She carried my heart, and a heart for the foe. _Ah, fare you well, my sailor._ "
239,NAMESAKES,"The _Nell_ and the _Maggie_, the _Ruth_ and the _Joan_, --_Roll and go, and fare you well_-- They come to their namesakes, and leave me alone. _Fare you well, my sailor._ And names are kep' dark, for the spies mustn't know; But they'll look in my face, an' I think it will show; Peggy Nutten's my name. Let her go! let her go! _Ah, fare you well, my sailor._ "
240,WIRELESS,WIRELESS 
241,WIRELESS,"Now to those who search the deep, _Gleam of Hope_ and _Kindly Light_, Once, before you turn to sleep, Breathe a message through the night. Never doubt that they'll receive it. Send it, once, and you'll believe it. "
242,WIRELESS,"Wrecks that burn against the stars, Decks where death is wallowing green, Snare the breath among their spars, Hear the flickering threads between, Quick, through all the storms that blind them, Quick with words that rush to find them. "
243,WIRELESS,Think you these aërial wires Whisper more than spirits may? Think you that our strong desires Touch no distance when we pray? Think you that no wings are flying 'Twixt the living and the dying? 
244,WIRELESS,"Inland, here, upon your knees, You shall breathe from urgent lips, Round the ships that guard your seas, Fleet on fleet of angel ships; Yea, the guarded may so bless them That no terrors can distress them. "
245,WIRELESS,"You shall guide the darkling prow, Kneeling thus--and far inland-- You shall touch the storm-beat brow Gently as a spirit-hand. Even a blindfold prayer may speed them, And a little child may lead them. "

249,FISHERS OF MEN,"""Shake out your spirit-sails, And brave those wilder gales, And I will make you then Fishers of men."" "
250,FISHERS OF MEN,"Was this, then, what He meant? Was this His high intent, After two thousand years Of blood and tears? "
251,FISHERS OF MEN,"God help us, if we fight For right, and not for might. God help us if we seek To shield the weak. "

255,AN OPEN BOAT,"See--quick--by that flash, where the bitter foam tosses, The cloud of white faces, in the black open boat, And the wild pleading woman that clasps her dead lover And wraps her loose hair round his breast and his throat. "
256,AN OPEN BOAT,"_""Come, lady, he's dead."" ""No, I feel his heart beating. He's living, I know. But he's numbed with the cold. See, I'm wrapping my hair all around him to warm him""---- --""No. We can't keep the dead, dear. Come, loosen your hold._ "

""You thought you saw our German God defeated?"" ""Oh, no!"" she said. ""I saw no lightnings fall. I dreamed of a whirlpool of green water, Where something had gone down. That was all. "
260,PEACE IN A PALACE,"_""All but the whimper of the sea gulls flying, Endlessly round and round, Waiting for the faces, the faces from the darkness, The dreadful rising faces of the drowned._ "

262,PEACE IN A PALACE,"They were drowning! They were drowning,"" said the Empress, ""And they stretched their feeble arms to the sky; But the worst was--they mistook me for their mother, And cried as my children used to cry. "

""What were they?""-- ""Some of them were hidden,"" said the Empress, ""But I plainly saw the L and the U!"" ""In God's name, stop!"" said the Emperor. ""You told me that it was not true! "
265,PEACE IN A PALACE,"_""Told me that you dreamed of the sea gulls flying, Endlessly round and round, Waiting for the faces, and the eyes in the faces, The eyes of the children that we drowned._ "
266,PEACE IN A PALACE,"""Kiss me and forget it,"" said the Emperor, ""Dry your tears on the tassel of my sword. I am going to offer peace to my people, And abdicate, perhaps, as overlord. I shall now take up My Cross as Count of Prussia-- Which is not a heavy burden, you'll agree. Why, before the twenty million dead are rotten There'll be yachting days again for you and me. Cheer up! It would mean a rope for anyone but Me."" "
267,PEACE IN A PALACE,"_""Oh, take care!"" said the Empress. ""They are flying, Endlessly round and round. They have finished with the faces, the dreadful little faces, The little eyeless faces of the drowned.""_ "

270,THE VINDICTIVE,"England, in her proud history, proudly enrolls them, And the deep night in her remembering skies With purer glory Shall blazon their grim story. "
271,THE VINDICTIVE,"There were no throngs to applaud that hushed adventure. They were one to a thousand on that fierce emprise. The shores they sought Were armoured, past all thought. "
272,THE VINDICTIVE,"O, they knew fear, be assured, as the brave must know it, With youth and its happiness bidding their last good-byes; Till thoughts, more dear Than life, cast out all fear. "
273,THE VINDICTIVE,"For if, as we think, they remembered the brown-roofed homesteads, And the scent of the hawthorn hedges when daylight dies, Old happy places, Young eyes and fading faces; "
274,THE VINDICTIVE,"One dream was dearer that night than the best of their boyhood, One hope more radiant than any their hearts could prize. The touch of your hand, The light of your face, England! "
275,THE VINDICTIVE,"So, age to age shall tell how they sailed through the darkness Where, under those high, austere, implacable stars, Not one in ten Might look for a dawn again. "
276,THE VINDICTIVE,"They saw the ferry-boats, _Iris_ and _Daffodil_, creeping Darkly as clouds to the shimmering mine-strewn bars, Flash into light! Then thunder reddened the night. "
277,THE VINDICTIVE,"The wild white swords of the search-lights blinded and stabbed them, The sharp black shadows fought in fantastic wars. Black waves leapt whitening, Red decks were washed with lightning. "
278,THE VINDICTIVE,"But, under the twelve-inch guns of the black land-batteries The hacked bright hulk, in a glory of crackling spars, Moved to her goal Like an immortal soul; "
279,THE VINDICTIVE,"That, while the raw rent flesh in a furnace is tortured, Reigns by a law no agony ever can shake, And shines in power Above all shocks of the hour. "
280,THE VINDICTIVE,"O, there, while the decks ran blood, and the star-shells lightened The old broken ship that the enemy never could break, Swept through the fire And grappled her heart's desire. "
281,THE VINDICTIVE,"There, on a wreck that blazed with the soul of England, The lads that died in the dark for England's sake Knew, as they died, Nelson was at their side; "
282,THE VINDICTIVE,"Nelson, and all the ghostly fleets of his island, Fighting beside them there, and the soul of Drake!-- Dreams, as we knew, Till these lads made them true. "

288,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"And Jack-in-the green, by a clown in blue, Walks like a two-legged bush of may, With the little wee lads that wriggled up the flue Ere Cheltenham town cried ""dancing day."" "
289,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"For brooms were short and the chimneys tall, And the gipsies caught 'em these blackbirds cheap, So Cheltenham bought them, spry and small, And shoved them up in the dark to sweep. "
290,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"For Cheltenham town was cruel of old, But she has been gathering garlands gay, And the little wee lads are in green and gold, For it's chimney-sweepers' dancing day. "
291,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"And red as a rose, and blue as the sky, With teeth as white as their faces are black, The master-sweeps go dancing by, With a gridiron painted on every back. "
292,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"But when they are ranged in the market-place, The clown's wife comes with an iron spoon, And cozens a penny for her sweet face To keep their golden throats in tune. "
293,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"Then, hushing the riot of that mad throng, And sweet as the voice of a long-dead May, A wandering pedlar lifts 'em a song, Of chimney-sweepers' dancing day; "
294,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"And the sooty faces, they try to recall.... As they gather around in their spell-struck rings.... But nobody knows that singer at all Or the curious old-time air he sings:-- "
295,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"Why are you dancing, O chimney-sweeps of Cheltenham, And where did you win you these may-coats so fine; For some are red as roses, and some are gold as daffodils, But who, ah, who remembers, now, a little lad of mine? "
296,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"Lady, we are dancing, as we danced in old England When the may was more than may, very long ago: As for our may-coats, it was your white hands, lady, Filled our sooty hearts and minds with blossom, white as snow. "
297,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"It was a beautiful face we saw, wandering through Cheltenham. It was a beautiful song we heard, very far away, Weeping for a little lad stolen by the gipsies, Broke our hearts and filled 'em with the glory of the may. "
298,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"Many a little lad had we, chirruping in the chimney-tops, Twirling out a sooty broom, a blot against the blue. Ah, but when we called to him, and when he saw and ran to her, All our winter ended, and our world was made anew. "
299,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"Then she gave us may-coats of gold and green and crimson, Then, with a long garland, she led our hearts away, Whispering, ""Remember, though the boughs forget the hawthorn, Yet shall I return to you, that was your lady May.""-- "
300,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"But why are you dancing now, O chimney-sweeps of Cheltenham, And why are you singing of a May that is fled?-- O, there's music to be born, though we pluck the old fiddle-strings, And a world's May awaking where the fields lay dead. "
301,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPS OF CHELTENHAM,"And we dance, dance, dreaming of a lady most beautiful That shall walk the green valleys of this dark earth one day, And call to us gently, ""O chimney-sweeps of Cheltenham, I am looking for my children. Awake, and come away."" "

305,TO A SUCCESSFUL MAN,Strange--is it not?--to find your chief desire Is what you might have had for nothing then-- The face of love beside a cottage fire And friendly laughter with your fellow-men? 
306,TO A SUCCESSFUL MAN,You were so rich when fools esteemed you poor. You ruled a field that kings could never buy; The glory of the sea was at your door; And all those quiet stars were in your sky. 
307,TO A SUCCESSFUL MAN,The nook of ferns below the breathless wood Where one poor book could unlock Paradise ... What will you give us now for that lost good? Better forget. You cannot pay the price. 
308,TO A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"You left them for the fame in which you trust. But youth, and hope--did you forsake them, too? Courage! When dust at length returns to dust, In your last dreams they may come back to you. "
309,THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH THE AMBER SNUFF-BOX,THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH THE AMBER SNUFF-BOX 
310,THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH THE AMBER SNUFF-BOX,"_The old gentleman, tapping his amber snuff-box (A heart-shaped snuff-box with a golden clasp) Stared at the dying fire. ""I'd like them all To understand, when I am gone,"" he muttered. ""But how to do it delicately! I can't Apologize. I'll hint at it ... in verse; And, to be sure that Rosalind reads it through, I'll make it an appendix to my will!"" --Still cynical, you see. He couldn't help it. He had seen much, felt much. He snapped the snuff box, Shook his white periwig, trimmed a long quill pen, And then began to write, most carefully, These couplets, in the old heroic style:--_ "
311,THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH THE AMBER SNUFF-BOX,"O, had I known in boyhood, only known The few sad truths that time has made my own, I had not lost the best that youth can give, Nay, life itself, in learning how to live. This laboring heart would not be tired so soon, This jaded blood would jog to a livelier tune: And some few friends, could I begin again, Should know more happiness, and much less pain. I should not wound in ignorance, nor turn In foolish pride from those for whom I yearn. I should have kept nigh half the friends I've lost, And held for dearest those I wronged the most. "
312,THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH THE AMBER SNUFF-BOX,"Yet, when I see more cunning men evade With colder tact, the blunders that I made; Sometimes I wonder if the better part Is not still mine, who lacked their subtle art. For I have conned my book in harsher schools, And learned from struggling what they worked by rules; Learned--with some pain--more quickly to forgive My fellow-blunderers, while they learn to live; Learned--with some tears--to keep a steadfast mind, And think more kindly of my own poor kind. "
313,THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH THE AMBER SNUFF-BOX,"_He read the verses through, shaking his wig. ""Perhaps ... perhaps""--he whispered to himself, ""I'd better leave it to the will of God. They might upset my own. I do not think They'd understand. Jocelyn might, perhaps; And Dick, if only they were left alone. But Rosalind never; nor that nephew of mine, The witty politician. No. No. No. They'd say my mind was wandering, I'm afraid."" So, with a frozen face, reluctantly, He tossed his verses into the dying fire, And watched the sparks fly upward. There, at dawn, They found him, cold and stiff by the cold hearth, His amber snuff-box in his ivory hand. ""You see,"" they said, ""he never needed friends. He had that curious antique frozen way. He had no heart--only an amber snuff-box. He died quite happily, taking a pinch of snuff."" "
314,THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH THE AMBER SNUFF-BOX,"His nephew, that engaging politician, Inherited the snuff-box, and remarked His epitaph should be ""Snuffed Out."" The clubs Laughed, and the statesman's reputation grew._ "

317,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"Your thoughts are for the poor and weak? Ah, no, the picturesque's your passion! Your tongue is always in your cheek At poverty that's not in fashion. "
318,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"You like a ploughman's rugged face, Or painted eyes in Piccadilly; But bowler hats are commonplace, And thread-bare tradesmen simply silly. "
319,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"The clerk that sings ""God save the King,"" And still believes his Tory paper,-- You hate the anæmic fool? I thought You loved the weak! Was that all vapour? "
320,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"Ah, when you sneer, dear democrat, At such a shiny-trousered Tory Because he doffs his poor old hat To what he thinks his country's glory, "
321,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"To you it's just a coloured rag. You hate the ""patriots"" that bawl so. Well, my Ulysses, there's a flag That lifts men in Republics also. "
322,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"No doubt his thoughts are cruder far; And, where those linen folds are shaking, Perhaps he sees a kind of star Because his eyes are tired and aching. "
323,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"Banal enough! Banal as truth! But I'm not thinking of his banners. I'm thinking of his pinched white youth And your disgusting ""new art"" manners. "
324,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"His meek submission stirs your hate? Better, my lad, if you're so fervent, Turn your cold steel against the State Instead of sneering at the servant. "
325,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"He does his job. He draws his pay. You sneer, and dine with those that pay him; And then you write a snobbish play For democrats, in which you play him. "
326,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"Ah, yes, you like simplicity That sucks its cheeks to make the dimple. But this domestic bourgeoisie You hate,--because it's all too simple. "
327,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"You hate the hearth, the wife, the child, You hate the heavens that bend above them. Your simple folk must all run wild Like jungle-beasts before you love them. "
328,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"You own a house in Cheyne Walk, (You say it costs three thousand fully) Where subtle snobs can talk and talk And play the intellectual bully. "
329,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"Yes. I say ""snobs."" Are names alone Free from all change? Your word ""Victorian"" Could bite and sting in ninety one But now--it's deader than the saurian. "
330,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"You think I live in yesterday, Because I think your way the wrong one; But I have hewed and ploughed my way, And--unlike yours--it's been a long one. "
331,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"I let Victoria toll her bell, And went with Strindberg for a ride, sir. I've fought through your own day as well, And come out on the other side, sir,-- "
332,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"The further side, the morning side, I read free verse (the Psalms) on Sunday. But I've decided (you'll decide) That there is room for song on Monday. "
333,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"I've seen the new snob on his way, The intellectual snob I mean, sir, The artist snob, in book and play, Kicking his mother round the scene, sir. "
334,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"I've heard the Tories talk like fools; And the rich fool that apes the Tory. I've seen the shopmen break your rules And die like Christ, in Christ's own glory. "
335,WHAT GRANDFATHER SAID,"But, as for you, that liberal sneer Reminds me of the poor old Kaiser. He was a ""socialist,"" my dear. Well, I'm your grandson. You'll grow wiser. "

338,MEMORIES OF THE PACIFIC COAST,"Deserts of all delight, Cactus and palm and earth of thirsty gold, Dark purple blooms round eaves of sun-washed white, And that Hesperian fruit men sought of old. "
339,MEMORIES OF THE PACIFIC COAST,"O, to be wandering there, Under the palm-trees, on that sunset shore, Where the waves break in song, and the bright air Is crystal clean; and peace is ours, once more. "
340,MEMORIES OF THE PACIFIC COAST,"There Beauty dwells, Beauty, re-born in whiteness from the foam; And Youth returns with all its magic spells, And the heart finds its long-forgotten home,-- "

345,NIPPON,"To rosy rifts and hillocks, To orchards that I knew, To snows of peach and cherry, And feathers of bamboo. "
346,NIPPON,"I saw, on twisted bridges, In blue and crimson gleams, The lanterns of the fishers, Along the brook of dreams. "
347,NIPPON,"I saw the wreaths of incense Like little ghosts arise, From temples under Fuji, From Fuji to the skies. "

359,THE REALMS OF GOLD,(Written after hearing a line of Keats repeated by a passing stranger under the palms of Southern California.) 
360,THE REALMS OF GOLD,"Under the palms of San Diego Where gold-skinned Mexicans loll at ease, And the red half-moons of their black-pipped melons Drop from their hands in the sunset seas, And an incense, out of the old brown missions, Blows through the orange trees; "
361,THE REALMS OF GOLD,"I wished that a poet who died in Europe Had found his way to this rose-red West; That Keats had walked by the wide Pacific And cradled his head on its healing breast, And made new songs of the sun-burned sea-folk, New poems, perhaps his best. "
362,THE REALMS OF GOLD,"I thought of him, under the ripe pomegranates At the desert's edge, where the grape-vines grow, In a sun-kissed ranch between grey-green sage-brush And amethyst mountains, peaked with snow, Or watching the lights of the City of Angels Glitter like stars below. "
363,THE REALMS OF GOLD,"He should walk, at dawn, by the lemon orchards, And breathe at ease in that dry bright air; And the Spanish bells in their crumbling cloisters Of brown adobe would sing to him there; And the old Franciscans would bring him their baskets Of apple and olive and pear. "
364,THE REALMS OF GOLD,"And the mandolins, in the deep blue twilight, Under that palm with the lion's mane, Would pluck, once more, at his golden heart-strings, And tell him the old sea-tales of Spain; And there should the daughters of Hesperus teach him Their mystical songs again. "
365,THE REALMS OF GOLD,"Then, the dusk blew sweet over seas of peach-bloom; The moon sailed white in the cloudless blue; The tree-toads purred, and the crickets chirruped; And better than anything dreamed came true; For, under the murmuring palms, a shadow Passed, with the eyes I knew; "
366,THE REALMS OF GOLD,"A shadow, perhaps, of the tall green fountains That rustled their fronds on that glittering sky, A hungering shadow, a lean dark shadow, A dreaming shadow that drifted by; But I heard him whisper the strange dark music That found it so ""rich to die."" "
367,THE REALMS OF GOLD,"And the murmuring palms of San Diego Shook with stars as he passed beneath. The Paradise palms, and the wild white orchards, The night, and its roses, were all one breath, Bearing the song of a nightingale seaward, A song that had out-soared death. "

377,DEAD MAN'S MORRICE,"There came a crowder to the Mermaid Inn, One dark May night, Fiddling a tune that quelled our motley din, With quaint delight, It haunts me yet, as old lost airs will do, A phantom strain: _Look for me once, lest I should look for you, And look in vain._ "
378,DEAD MAN'S MORRICE,"In that old wood, where ghosts of lovers walk, At fall of day, Gleaning such fragments of their ancient talk As poor ghosts may, From leaves that brushed their faces, wet with dew, Or tears, or rain,... _Look for me once, lest I should look for you, And look in vain._ "
379,DEAD MAN'S MORRICE,"Have we not seen them--pale forgotten shades That do return, Groping for those dim paths, those fragrant glades, Those nooks of fern, Only to find that, of the may they knew, No wraiths remain; _Yet they still look, as I should look for you, And look in vain._ "
380,DEAD MAN'S MORRICE,"They see those happier ghosts that waned away-- Whither, who knows?-- Ghosts that come back with music and the may, And Spring's first rose, Lover and lass, to sing the old burden through, Stave and refrain: _Look for me once, lest I should look for you, And look in vain._ "
381,DEAD MAN'S MORRICE,"So, after death, if in that starless deep, I lose your eyes, I'll haunt familiar places. I'll not keep Tryst in the skies. I'll haunt the whispering elms that found us true, The old grass-grown lane. _Look for me there, lest I should look for you, And look in vain._ "
382,DEAD MAN'S MORRICE,"There, as of old, under the dreaming moon, A phantom throng Floats through the fern, to a ghostly morrice tune, A thin sweet song, Hands link with hands, eyes drown in eyes anew, Lips meet again.... _Look for me, once, lest I should look for you, And look in vain._ "

385,THE OLD FOOL IN THE WOOD,"""If I could whisper you all I've heard,"" Said the Old Fool in the fern, ""You'd never say the song of a bird. You'd say, 'I'll listen, and p'raps I'll learn One word of His joy as He passed this way, One syllable more,' That's what you'd say."" "
386,THE OLD FOOL IN THE WOOD,"""If I could tell you all the rest,"" Said the Old Fool under the skies, ""You'd hug your griefs against your breast And whisper with love-lit eyes, 'I am one with the sorrow that made the may, And the pulse of His heart,' That's what you'd say."" "

389,A NEW MADRIGAL TO AN OLD MELODY,"As along a dark pine-bough, in slender white mystery The moon lay to listen, above the thick fern, In a deep dreaming wood that is older than history I heard a lad sing, and I stilled me to learn; So rarely he lilted his long-forgot litany,-- _Fall, April; fall, April, in dew on our dearth! Bring balm, and bring poppy, bring deep sleepy dittany For Marian, our clear May, so long laid in earth._ "
390,A NEW MADRIGAL TO AN OLD MELODY,"Then I drew back the branches. I saw him that chanted it. I saw his fool's bauble. I knew his old grief. I knew that old greenwood and the shadow that haunted it,-- My fool, my lost jester, my _Shadow-of-a-Leaf_! And ""why,"" I said, ""why, all this while, have you left me so Luckless in melody, lonely in mirth?"" ""Oh, why,"" he sang, ""why has this world then bereft me so Soon of my Marian, so long laid in earth? "
391,A NEW MADRIGAL TO AN OLD MELODY,"""In the years that are gone,"" he said, ""love was more fortunate. Grief was our minstrel of things that endure. Now, ashes and dust and this world grow importunate. Time has no sorrow that time cannot cure. Once, we could lose, and the loss was worth cherishing. Now, we may win, but, O, where is the worth? Memory and true love,"" he whispered, ""are perishing, With Marian, our clear May, so long laid in earth."" "
392,A NEW MADRIGAL TO AN OLD MELODY,"""Ah, no!"" I said, ""no! Since we grieve for our grief again, Touch the old strings! Let us try the old stave! And memory may wake, like my _Shadow-of-a-Leaf_ again, Singing of hope, in the dark, by a grave."" So we sang it together--that long-forgot litany:-- _Fall, April; fall, April; bring new grief to birth. Bring wild herb of grace, and bring deep healing dittany, For Marian, our clear May, so long laid in earth._ "

394,THE LOST BATTLE,It is not over yet-the fight Where those immortal dreamers failed. They stormed the citadels of night And the night praised them--and prevailed. So long ago the cause was lost We scarce distinguish friend from foe; But--if the dead can help it most-- The armies of the dead will grow. 
395,THE LOST BATTLE,"The world has all our banners now, And filched our watchwords for its own. The world has crowned the ""rebel's"" brow And millions crowd his lordly throne. The masks have altered. Names are names; They praise the ""truth"" that is not true. The ""rebel"" that the world acclaims Is not the rebel Shelley knew. "
396,THE LOST BATTLE,"We may not build that Commonweal. We may not reach the goal we set. But there's a flag they dare not steal. Forward! It is not over yet. We shall be dust and under dust Before we end that ancient wrong; But here's a sword that cannot rust, And where's the death can touch a song? "
397,THE LOST BATTLE,"So, when our bodies rot in earth The singing souls that once were ours, Weaponed with light and helmed with mirth, Shall front the kingdoms and the powers. The ancient lie is on its throne, And half the living still forget; But, since the dead are all our own, Courage, it is not over yet. "

454,IV.,"Last night I saw a dead man borne along The city streets, passing a boisterous throng That never ceased to laugh and shout and dance: And yet, and yet, For all the poison bitter minds might brew From themes like this, I knew That the stern Truth would not permit her glance Thus to be foiled by flying straws of chance, For her keen eyes on deeper skies are set, And laws that tragic ironists forget. "
455,IV.,"She saw the dead man's life, from birth to death,-- All that he knew of love and sin and pain, Success and failure (not as this world sees), His doubts, his passions, inner loss and gain, And borne on darker tides of constant law Beyond the margin of this life she saw All that had left his body with the breath. These things, to her, were still realities. "
456,IV.,"If any mourned for him unseen, She saw them, too. If none, she'd not pretend His clay were colder, or his God less true, Or that his grave, at length, would be less green. She'd not deny The boundless depths of her eternal sky Brooding above a boundless universe, Because he seemed to man's unseeing eye Going a little further to fare worse; Nor would she assume he lacked that unseen friend Whom even the tragic ironists declare Were better than the seen, in his last end. "
457,IV.,"Oh, then, beware, beware, Lest in the strong name of ""reality"" You mock yourselves anew with shapes of air, Lest it be you, agnostics, who re-write The fettering creeds of night, Affirm you know your own Unknowable, And lock the wingéd soul in a new hell; Lest it be you, lip-worshippers of Truth, Who break the heart of youth; Lest it be you, the realists, who fight With shadows, and forget your own pure light; Lest it be you who, with a little shroud Snatched from the sightless faces of the dead, Hoodwink the world, and keep the mourner bowed In dust, real dust, with stones, real stones, for bread; Lest, as you look one eighth of an inch beneath The yellow skin of death, You dream yourselves discoverers of the skull That old _memento mori_ of our faith; Lest it be you who hunt a flying wraith Through this dissolving stuff of hill and cloud; Lest it be you, who, at the last, annul Your covenant with your kind; Lest it be you who darken heart and mind, Sell the strong soul in bondage to a dream, And fetter us once more to things that seem.

459,V,(_An Answer_) 
460,V,"[After reading an article in a leading London journal by an ""intellectual"" who attacked one of the noblest poets and greatest artists of a former century (or any century) on the ground that his high ethical standards were incompatible with the new lawlessness. This vicious lawlessness the writer described definitely, and he paid his tribute to dishonour as openly and brutally as any of the Bolsheviki could have done. I had always known that this was the real ground of the latter-day onslaught on some of the noblest literature of the past; but I had never seen it openly confessed before. The time has now surely come when, if our civilization is to make any fight at all against the new ""red ruin and breaking up of laws,"" we must cease to belaud our slack-minded, latter-day ""literature of rebellion"" for its cleverness in making scraps of paper out of the plain laws of right and wrong. It has been doing this for more than twenty-five years, and the same has become fashionable among those who are too busy to read carefully or understand fully what pitfalls are being prepared for their own feet and the feet of their children.] "
461,I,I 
462,I,"If this were true, England indeed were dead. If the wild fashion of that poisonous hour Wherein the new Salome, clothed with power, Wriggled and hissed, with hands and feet so red, Should even now demand that glorious head, Whose every word was like an English flower, Whose every song an English April shower, Whose every thought immortal wine and bread; If this were true, if England should prefer Darkness, corruption, and the adulterous crew, Shakespeare and Browning would cry shame on her, And Milton would deny the land he knew; And those who died in Flanders yesterday Would thank their God they sleep in cleaner clay. "
463,II,II 
464,II,"It is not true. Only these ""rebel"" wings, These glittering clouds of ""intellectual"" flies Out of the stagnant pools of midnight rise From the old dead creeds, with carrion-poisoned stings They strike at noble and ignoble things, Immortal Love with the old world's out-worn lies, But even now, a wind from clearer skies Dissolves in smoke their coteries and wings. "
465,II,"See, their divorced idealist re-divorces The wife he stole from his own stealing friend! And _these_ would pluck the high stars from their courses, And mock the fools that praise them, till the end! Well, let the whole world praise them. Truth can wait Till our new England shall unlock the gate. "
466,III,III 
467,III,"Yes. Let the fools go paint themselves with woad, For we've a jest between us, Truth and I. We know that those who live by fashion die Also by fashion, and that mode kills mode. We know the great new age is on the road, And death is at the heart of every lie. But we've a jest between us, Truth and I. And we have locked the doors to our abode. "
468,III,"Yet if some great new ""rebel"" in his pride Should pass that way and hear us laughing low Like lovers, in the darkness, side by side, He might catch this:--""The dullards do not know That names are names. New 'rebel' is old 'thrall.'"" And we're the lonely dreamers after all. "

470,THE COMPANIONS,"How few are they that voyage through the night On that eternal quest, For that strange light beyond our light, That rest beyond our rest. "
471,THE COMPANIONS,"And they who, seeking beauty, once descry Her face, to most unknown; Thenceforth like changelings from the sky Must walk their road alone. "
472,THE COMPANIONS,"So once I dreamed. So idle was my mood; But now, before these eyes, From those foul trenches, black with blood, What radiant legions rise! "
473,THE COMPANIONS,And loveliness over the wounded earth awakes Like wild-flowers in the Spring. Out of the mortal chrysalis breaks Immortal wing on wing.

476,THE LITTLE ROADS,"The great roads are all grown over That seemed so firm and white. The deep black forests have covered them. How should I walk aright? How should I thread these tangled mazes, Or grope to that far off light? I stumble round the thickets, and they turn me Back to the thickets and the night. "
477,THE LITTLE ROADS,"Yet, sometimes, at a word, an elfin pass-word, (O, thin, deep, sweet with beaded rain!) There shines, through a mist of ragged-robins, The old lost April-coloured lane, That leads me from myself; for, at a whisper, Where the strong limbs thrust in vain, At a breath, if my heart help another heart, The path shines out for me again. "
478,THE LITTLE ROADS,"A thin thread, a rambling lane for lovers To the light of the world's one May, Where the white dropping flakes may wet our faces As we lift them to the bloom-bowed spray: O Master, shall we ask Thee, then, for high-roads, Or down upon our knees and pray That Thou wilt ever lose us in Thy little lanes, And lead us by a wandering way.

481,SUNLIGHT AND SEA,"Light of the Sun, Life of the Sun, O happy, bold companion, Whose golden laughters round me run, Making wine of the blue air With wild-rose kisses everywhere, Browning the limb, flushing the cheek, Apple-fragrant, leopard-sleek, Dancing from thy red-curtained East Like a Nautch-girl to my feast, Proud because her lord, the Spring, Praised the way those anklets ring; Or wandering like a white Greek maid Leaf-dappled through the dancing shade, Where many a green-veined leaf imprints Breast and limb with emerald tints, That softly net her silken shape But let the splendour still escape, While rosy ghosts of roses flow Over the supple rose and snow. "
482,SUNLIGHT AND SEA,"But sweetest, fairest is thy face, When we meet, when we embrace, Where the white sand sleeps at noon Round that lonely blue lagoon, Fringed with one white reef of coral Where the sea-birds faintly quarrel And the breakers on the reef Fade into a dream of grief, And the palm-trees overhead Whisper that all grief is dead. "
483,SUNLIGHT AND SEA,"Sister Sunlight, lead me then Into thy healing seas again.... For when we swim out, side by side, Like a lover with his bride, When thy lips are salt with brine, And thy wild eyes flash in mine, The music of a mightier sea Beats with my blood in harmony. I breast the primal flood of being, Too clear for speech, too near for seeing; And to his heart, new reconciled, The Eternal takes his earth-bound child. "
484,SUNLIGHT AND SEA,"Who the essential secret spells In those gigantic syllables,-- Flowing, ebbing, ebbing, flowing,-- Gathers wisdom past all knowing. Song of the Sea, I hear, I hear, That deeper music of the sphere, Catch the rhythm of sun and star, And know what light and darkness are; Ay, faint beginnings of a rhyme That swells beyond the tides of time; Beat with thy rhythm in blood and breath, And make one song of life and death. I hear, I hear, and rest content, Merged in the primal element, The old element whence life arose, The fount of youth, to which it goes. "

498,THE NIGHT OF THE LION,"""_And that a reply be received before midnight._"" _British Ultimatum_. "
499,THE NIGHT OF THE LION,"Their Day was at twelve of the night, When the graves give up their dead. And still, from the City, no light Yellows the clouds overhead. Where the Admiral stands there's a star, But his column is lost in the gloom; For the brazen doors are ajar, And the Lion awakes, and the doom. "
500,THE NIGHT OF THE LION,"_He is not of a chosen race. His strength is the strength of the skies, In whose glory all nations have place, In whose downfall Liberty dies. He is mighty, but he is just. He shall live to the end of years. He shall bring the proud to the dust. He shall raise the weak to the spheres._ "
501,THE NIGHT OF THE LION,"It is night on the world's great mart, But the brooding hush is awake With the march of a steady heart That calls like the drum of Drake, _Come!_ And a muttering deep As the pulse of the distant guns, Or the thunder before the leap Thro' the rolling thoroughfare runs. "
502,THE NIGHT OF THE LION,And the wounded men go by Like thoughts in the Lion's brain. And the clouds lift on high Like the slow waves of his mane And the narrowing lids conceal The furnaces of his eyes. Their gold is gone out. They reveal Only two search-lights of steel Steadily sweeping the skies. 
503,THE NIGHT OF THE LION,"And we hoped he had peace in his lair Where the bones of old tyrannies lay, And the skulls that his cubs have stripped bare, The old skulls they still toss in their play. But the tyrants are risen again, And the last light dies from their path; For the midnight of his mane Lifts to the stars with his wrath. "
504,THE NIGHT OF THE LION,"From the East to the West he is crouching. He snuffs at the North-East wind. His breast upon Britain is couching. His haunches quiver on Ind. It is night, black night, where he lies; But a kingdom and a fleet Shall burn in his terrible eyes When he leaps, and the darkness dies With the War-gods under his feet. "
505,THE NIGHT OF THE LION,"_Till the day when a little child, Shall lay but a hand on his mane, And his eyes grow golden and mild And he stands in the heavens again; Till the day of the seventh seal, Which the Lion alone shall rend, When the stars from their courses reel, His Freedom shall not end._ "

508,I.,"Black-veiled, black-gowned, she rides in bus and train, With eyes that fill too listlessly for tears. Her waxen hands clasp and unclasp again. _Good News_, they cry. She neither sees nor hears. "
509,I.,"Good News, perhaps, may crown some far-off king. Good News may peal the glory of the state-- Good News may cause the courts of heaven to ring. She sees a hand waved at a garden gate. "
510,I.,"For her dull ears are tuned to other themes; And her dim eyes can never see aright. She glides--a ghost--through all her April dreams, To meet his eyes at dawn, his lips at night. "
511,I.,Wraiths of a truth that others never knew; And yet--for her--the only truth that's true. 
512,II.,II. 
513,II.,_Good News! Good News!_ There is no way but this. Out of the night a star begins to rise. I know not where my soul's deep Master is; Nor can I hear those angels in the skies;

515,II.,"Yet, at this world's heart stands the Eternal Cross, The ultimate frame of moon and star and sun, Where Love with out-stretched arms, in utter loss, Points East and West and makes the whole world one. "

517,THE BELL,THE BELL 
518,THE BELL,"The Temple Bell was out of tune, That once out-melodied sun and moon. "
519,THE BELL,Instead of calling folk to prayer It spread an evil in the air. 
520,THE BELL,"Instead of a song, from north to south, It put a lie in the wind's mouth. "
521,THE BELL,"The very palms beneath it died, So harsh it jarred, so loud it lied. "
522,THE BELL,"Then the gods told the blue-robed bonze: ""_Your Bell is only wrought of bronze._ "
523,THE BELL,"_Lower it down, cast it again, Or you shall shake the heavens in vain._"" "
524,THE BELL,"Then, as the mighty cauldron hissed, Men brought the wealth that no man missed. "
525,THE BELL,"Yea, they brought silver, they brought gold, And melted them into the seething mould. "
526,THE BELL,"The miser brought his greening hoard, And the king cast in his sword. "
527,THE BELL,"Yet, when the Bell in the Temple swung, It jarred the stars with its harsh tongue. "
528,THE BELL,"""_Is this your best?_"" the oracle said, ""_Then were you better drunk or dead._"" "
529,THE BELL,"Once again they melted it down, And the king cast in his crown. "
530,THE BELL,"Then they poured wine, and bullock's blood, Into the hot, grey, seething flood. "
531,THE BELL,"They gave it mellowing fruits to eat, And honey-combs to make it sweet. "
532,THE BELL,"Yet, when they hauled it to the sky, The Bell was one star-shattering lie. "
533,THE BELL,"So, for the third time and the last, They lowered it down to be re-cast. "
534,THE BELL,"The white-hot metal seethed anew, And the crowd shrank as the heat grew; "
535,THE BELL,"But a white-robed woman, queenly and tall, Pressed to the brink before them all, "
536,THE BELL,"One breast, like a golden fruit lay bare; She held her small son feeding there. "
537,THE BELL,"She plucked him off, she lifted him high, Like rose-red fruit on the blue sky. "
538,THE BELL,"She pressed her lips to the budded feet, And murmured softly, ""_Oh, sweet, my sweet._"" "
539,THE BELL,"She whispered, ""_Gods, that my land may live, I give the best that I have to give!_"" "
540,THE BELL,"Then, then, before the throng awoke, Before one cry from their white lips broke, "
541,THE BELL,"She tossed him into the fiery flood, Her child, her baby, her flesh and blood. "
542,THE BELL,And the crisp hissing waves closed round And melted him through without a sound. 
543,THE BELL,"""_Too quick for pain_,"" they heard her say, And she sobbed, once, and she turned away. "
544,THE BELL,*       *       *       *       * 
545,THE BELL,"The Temple Bell, in peace and war, Keeps the measure of sun and star. "
546,THE BELL,"But sometimes, in the night it cries Faintly, and a voice replies: "
547,THE BELL,"_Mother, Oh, mother, the Bell rings true!-- You were all that I had!--Oh, mother, my mother!-- With the land and the Bell it is well. Is it well, Is it well with the heart that had you and none other?_ "

551,SLAVE AND EMPEROR,"Yet, in the darkest hour of all, When black defeat began, The Emperor heard the mountains quake, He felt the graves beneath him shake, He watched his legions rally and break, And he whimpered as they ran. "
552,SLAVE AND EMPEROR,"""I hear a shout that moves the earth, A cry that wakes the dead! Will no one tell me whence they come, For all my messengers are dumb? What power is this that comes to birth And breaks my power?"" he said. "
553,SLAVE AND EMPEROR,"Then, all around his foundering guns, Though dawn was now not far, The darkness filled with a living fear That whispered at the Emperor's ear, ""_The armies of the dead draw near Beneath an eastern star._"" "
554,SLAVE AND EMPEROR,"_The trumpet blows in Nazareth. The Slave is risen again. Across the bitter wastes of death The horsemen ride from Nazareth, And the Power we mocked as wasted breath Returns, in power, to reign; Rides on, in white, through Nazareth, To save His world again._ "

558,ON A MOUNTAIN TOP,"On this bare crest, the angels kneel And breathe the sweets that rise From flowers too little to reveal Their beauty to our eyes. "
559,ON A MOUNTAIN TOP,"I have seen Edens on the earth With queenly blooms arrayed; But here the fairest come to birth, The smallest flowers He made. "
560,ON A MOUNTAIN TOP,"O, high above the sounding pine, And richer, sweeter far, The wild thyme wakes. The celandine Looks at the morning star. "
561,ON A MOUNTAIN TOP,"They may not see the heavens unfold. They breathe no out-worn prayer; But, on a mountain, as of old, His glory fills the air. "

564,THE PHANTOM FLEET,THE PHANTOM FLEET (1904) 
565,THE PHANTOM FLEET,The sunset lingered in the pale green West: In rosy wastes the low soft evening star Woke; while the last white sea-mew sought for rest; And tawny sails came stealing o'er the bar. 
566,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"But, in the hillside cottage, through the panes The light streamed like a thin far trumpet-call, And quickened, as with quivering battle-stains, The printed ships that decked the parlour wall. "
567,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"From oaken frames old admirals looked down: They saw the lonely slumberer at their feet: They saw the paper, headed _Talk from Town; Our rusting trident, and our phantom fleet_: "
568,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"And from a neighbouring tavern surged a song Of England laughing in the face of war, With eyes unconquerably proud and strong, And lips triumphant from her Trafalgar. "
569,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"But he, the slumberer in that glimmering room, Saw distant waters glide and heave and gleam; Around him in the softly coloured gloom The pictures clustered slowly to a dream. "
570,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"He saw how England, resting on her past, Among the faded garlands of her dead, Woke; for a whisper reached her heart at last, And once again she raised her steel-clad head. "
571,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Her eyes were filled with sudden strange alarms; She heard the westering waters change and chime; She heard the distant tumult of her arms Defeated, not by courage, but by Time. "
572,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Knowledge had made a deadlier pact with death, Nor strength nor steel availed against that bond: Slowly approached--and Britain held her breath-- The battle booming from the deeps beyond. "
573,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"O, then what darkness rolled upon the wind, Threatening the torch that Britain held on high? Where all her navies, baffled, broken, blind, Slunk backward, snarling in their agony! _Who guards the gates of Freedom now?_ The cry Stabbed heaven! _England, the shattered ramparts fall!_ Then, like a trumpet shivering through the sky O, like white lightning rending the black pall Of heaven, an answer pealed: _Her dead shall hear that call._ "
574,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Then came a distant light of great waves breaking That brought the sunset on each crumbling crest, A rumour as of buried ages waking, And mighty spirits rising from their rest; Then ghostly clouds arose, with billowing breast, White clouds that turned to sails upon their way, Red clouds that burned like flags against the West, Till even the conquering fleet in silence lay Dazed with that strange old light, and night grew bright as day. "
575,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"_We come to fight for Freedom!_ The great East Heard, and was rent asunder like a veil. Host upon host out of the night increased Its towering clouds and crowded zones of sail: _England, our England, canst thou faint or fail? We come to fight for Freedom yet once more!_ This, this is ours at least! Count the great tale Of all these dead that rise to guard thy shore By right of the red life they never feared to pour. "
576,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"_We come to fight for Freedom!_ On they came, One cloud of beauty sweeping the wild sea; And there, through all their thousands, flashed like flame That star-born signal of the Victory: _Duty_, that deathless lantern of the free; _Duty_, that makes a god of every man. And there was Nelson, watching silently As through the phantom fleet the message ran; And his tall frigate rushed before the stormy van. "
577,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Nelson, our Nelson, frail and maimed and blind, Stretched out his dead cold face against the foe: And England's Raleigh followed hard behind, With all his eager fighting heart aglow; Glad, glad for England's sake once more to know The old joy of battle and contempt of pain; Glad, glad to die, if England willed it so, The traitor's and the coward's death again; But hurl the world back now as once he hurled back Spain. "
578,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"And there were all those others, Drake and Blake, Rodney and Howard, Byron, Collingwood; With deathless eyes aflame for England's sake, As on their ancient decks they proudly stood,-- Decks washed of old with England's purplest blood; And there, once more, each rushing oaken side Bared its dark-throated, thirsty, gleaming brood Of cannon, watched by laughing lads who died Long, long ago for England and her ancient pride. "
579,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"_We come to fight for England!_ The great sea In a wild light of song began to break Round that tall phantom of the Victory And all the foam was music in her wake: Ship after phantom ship, with guns a-rake And shot-rent flags a-stream from every mast Moved in a deepening splendour, not to make A shield for England of her own dead past; But, with a living dream to arm her soul at last. "
580,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"_We come to die for England_: through the hush Of gathered nations rose that regal cry, From naked oaken walls one word could crush If those vast armoured throats dared to reply: But there the most implacable enemy Felt his eyes fill with gladder, prouder tears, As Nelson's calm eternal face went by, Gazing beyond all perishable fears To some diviner goal above the waste of years. "
581,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Through the hushed fleets the vision streamed away, Then slowly turned once more to that deep West, While voices cried, O, England, the new day Is dawning, but thy soul can take no rest. "
582,THE PHANTOM FLEET,Thy freedom and thy peace are only thine By right of toil on every land and sea And by that crimson sacrificial wine Of thine own heart and thine own agony. 
583,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Peace is not slumber. Peace, in every hour, Throbs like the heart of music. This alone Can save thy heritage and confirm that power Whereof the past is but the cushioned throne. "
584,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Look to the fleet! Again and yet again, Hear us who storm thy heart with this one cry. Hear us, who cannot help, though fair and fain, To hold thy seas before thee, and to die. "
585,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Look to the fleet! Thy fleet, the first, last line: The sword of Liberty, her strength, her shield, Her food, her life-blood! Britain, it is thine, Here, now, to hold that birth-right, or to yield. "
586,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"So, through the dark, those phantom ships of old Faded, it seemed, through mists of blood and tears. Sails turned to clouds, and slowly westward rolled The sad returning pageant of the years. On tides of light, where all our tumults cease, Through that rich West, the Victory returned; And all the waves around her whispered ""peace,"" And from her mast no battle-message burned. "
587,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Like clouds, like fragments of those fading skies, The pageant passed, with all its misty spars, While the hushed nations raised their dreaming eyes To that great light which brings the end of wars. "
588,THE PHANTOM FLEET,"Ship after ship, in some strange glory drowned, Cloud after cloud, was lost in that deep light Each with a sovran stillness haloed round. Then--that high fleet of stars led on the night. "
589,MICHAEL OAKTREE,MICHAEL OAKTREE 
590,MICHAEL OAKTREE,Under an arch of glorious leaves I passed Out of the wood and saw the sickle moon Floating in daylight o'er the pale green sea. 
591,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"It was the quiet hour before the sun Gathers the clouds to prayer and silently Utters his benediction on the waves That whisper round the death-bed of the day. The labourers were returning from the farms And children danced to meet them. From the doors Of cottages there came a pleasant clink Where busy hands laid out the evening meal. From smouldering elms around the village spire There soared and sank the caw of gathering rooks. The faint-flushed clouds were listening to the tale The sea tells to the sunset with one sigh. The last white wistful sea-bird sought for peace, And the last fishing-boat stole o'er the bar, And fragrant grasses, murmuring a prayer, Bowed all together to the holy west, Bowed all together thro' the golden hush, The breathing hush, the solemn scented hush, The holy, holy hush of eventide. "
592,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"And, in among the ferns that crowned the hill With waving green and whispers of the wind, A boy and girl, carelessly linking hands, Into their golden dream drifted away. On that rich afternoon of scent and song Old Michael Oaktree died. It was not much He wished for; but indeed I think he longed To see the light of summer once again Blossoming o'er the far blue hills. I know He used to like his rough-hewn wooden bench Placed in the sun outside the cottage door Where in the listening stillness he could hear, Across the waving gilly-flowers that crowned His crumbling garden wall, the long low sigh Of supreme peace that whispers to the hills The sacred consolation of the sea. He did not hope for much: he longed to live Until the winter came again, he said; But on the last sweet eve of May he died. "
593,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"I wandered sadly through the dreaming lanes Down to the cottage on that afternoon; For I had known old Michael Oaktree now So many years, so many happy years. When I was little he had carried me High on his back to see the harvest home, And given me many a ride upon his wagon Among the dusty scents of sun and hay. He showed me how to snare the bulky trout That lurked under the bank of yonder brook. Indeed, he taught me many a country craft, For I was apt to learn, and, as I learnt, I loved the teacher of that homely lore. Deep in my boyish heart he shared the glad Influence of the suns and winds and waves, Giving my childhood what it hungered for-- The rude earth-wisdom of the primal man. "
594,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"He had retained his childhood: Death for him Had no more terror than his bed. He walked With wind and sunlight like a brother, glad Of their companionship and mutual aid. We, toilers after truth, are weaned too soon From earth's dark arms and naked barbarous breast. Too soon, too soon, we leave the golden feast, Fetter the dancing limbs and pluck the crown Of roses from the dreaming brow. We pass Our lives in most laborious idleness. For we have lost the meaning of the world; We have gone out into the night too soon; We have mistaken all the means of grace And over-rated our small power to learn. And the years move so swiftly over us: We have so little time to live in worlds Unrealised and unknown realms of joy, We are so old before we learn how vain Our effort was, how fruitlessly we cast Our Bread upon the waters, and how weak Our hearts were, but our chance desires how strong! Then, in the dark, our sense of light decays; We cannot cry to God as once we cried! Lost in the gloom, our faith, perhaps our love, Lies dead with years that never can return. "
595,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"But Michael Oaktree was a man whose love Had never waned through all his eighty years. His faith was hardly faith. He seemed a part Of all that he believed in. He had lived In constant conversation with the sun, The wind, the silence and the heart of peace; In absolute communion with the Power That rules all action and all tides of thought, And all the secret courses of the stars; The Power that still establishes on earth Desire and worship, through the radiant laws Of Duty, Love and Beauty; for through these As through three portals of the self-same gate The soul of man attains infinity, And enters into Godhead. So he gained On earth a fore-taste of Nirvana, not The void of eastern dream, but the desire And goal of all of us, whether thro' lives Innumerable, by slow degrees, we near The death divine, or from this breaking body Of earthly death we flash at once to God. Through simple love and simple faith, this man Attained a height above the hope of kings. "
596,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Yet, as I softly shut the little gate And walked across the garden, all the scents Of mingling blossom ached like inmost pain Deep in my heart, I know not why. They seemed Distinct, distinct as distant evening bells Tolling, over the sea, a secret chime That breaks and breaks and breaks upon the heart In sorrow rather than in sound, a chime Strange as a streak of sunset to the moon, Strange as a rose upon a starlit grave, Strange as a smile upon a dead man's lips; A chime of melancholy, mute as death But strong as love, uttered in plangent tones Of honeysuckle, jasmine, gilly-flowers, Jonquils and aromatic musky leaves, Lilac and lilies to the rose-wreathed porch. "
597,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"At last I tapped and entered and was drawn Into the bedroom of the dying man, Who lay, propped up with pillows, quietly Gazing; for through his open casement far Beyond the whispers of the gilly-flowers He saw the mellow light of eventide Hallow the west once more; and, as he gazed, I think I never saw so great a peace On any human face. There was no sound Except the slumbrous pulsing of a clock, The whisper of the garden and, far off, The sacred consolation of the sea. "
598,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"His wife sat at his bed-side: she had passed Her eightieth year; her only child was dead. She had been wedded more than sixty years, And she sat gazing with the man she loved Quietly, out into that unknown Deep. "
599,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"A butterfly floated into the room And back again, pausing awhile to bask And wink its painted fans on the warm sill; A bird piped in the roses and there came Into the childless mother's ears a sound Of happy laughing children, far away. "
600,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Then Michael Oaktree took his wife's thin hand Between his big rough hands. His eyes grew dark, And, as he turned to her and died, he spoke Two words of perfect faith and love--_Come soon_! "
601,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"O then in all the world there was no sound Except the slumbrous pulsing of a clock, The whisper of the leaves and far away, The infinite compassion of the sea. But, as I softly passed out of the porch And walked across the garden, all the scents Of mingling blossoms ached like inmost joy, Distinct no more, but like one heavenly choir Pealing one mystic music, still and strange As voices of the holy Seraphim, One voice of adoration, mute as love, Stronger than death, and pure with wedded tones Of honeysuckle, jasmine, gilly-flowers, Jonquils and aromatic musky leaves, Lilac and lilies to the garden gate. "
602,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"O then indeed I knew how closely knit To stars and flowers we are, how many means Of grace there are for those that never lose Their sense of membership in this divine Body of God; for those that all their days Have walked in quiet communion with the Life That keeps the common secret of the sun, The wind, the silence and the heart of man. There is one God, one Love, one everlasting Mystery of Incarnation, one creative Passion behind the many-coloured veil. "
603,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"We have obscured God's face with partial truths, The cause of all our sorrow and sin, our wars Of force and thought, in this unheavened world. Yet, by the battle of our partial truths, The past against the present and the swift Moment of passing joy against the deep Eternal love, ever the weaker truth Falls to the stronger, till once more we near The enfolding splendour of the whole. Our God Has been too long a partial God. We are all Made in His image, men and birds and beasts, Mountains and clouds and cataracts and suns, With those great Beings above our little world, A height beyond for every depth below, Those long-forgotten Princedoms, Virtues, Powers, Existences that live and move in realms As far beyond our thought as Europe lies With all its little arts and sciences Beyond the comprehension of the worm. We are all partial images, we need What lies beyond us to complete our souls; Therefore our souls are filled with a desire And love which lead us towards the Infinity Of Godhead that awaits us each and all. "
604,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Peacefully through the dreaming lanes I went. The sun sank, and the birds were hushed. The stars Trembled like blossoms in the purple trees. But, as I paused upon the whispering hill The mellow light still lingered in the west, And dark and soft against that rosy depth A boy and girl stood knee-deep in the ferns. Dreams of the dead man's youth were in my heart, Yet I was very glad; and as the moon Brightened, they kissed; and, linking hand in hand, Down to their lamp-lit home drifted away. "
605,MICHAEL OAKTREE,"Under an arch of leaves, into the gloom I went along the little woodland road, And through the breathless hedge of hawthorn heard Out of the deepening night, the long low sigh Of supreme peace that whispers to the hills The sacrament and sabbath of the sea. "
606,TOUCHSTONE ON A BUS,TOUCHSTONE ON A BUS 
607,TOUCHSTONE ON A BUS,"Last night I rode with Touchstone on a bus From Ludgate Hill to World's End. It was he! Despite the broadcloth and the bowler hat, I knew him, Touchstone, the wild flower of folly, The whetstone of his age, the scourge of kings, The madcap morning star of elfin-land, Who used to wrap his legs around his neck For warmth on winter nights. He had slipped back, To see what men were doing in a world That should be wiser. He had watched a play, Read several books, heard men discourse of art And life; and he sat bubbling like a spring In Arden. Never did blackbird, drenched with may, Chuckle as Touchstone chuckled on that ride. _Lord, what a world! Lord, what a mad, mad world!_ Then, to the jolt and jingle of the engine, He burst into this bunch of madcap rhymes:-- "

610,THE NEW DUCKLING,THE NEW DUCKLING 
611,THE NEW DUCKLING,"""I want to be new,"" said the duckling. ""O, ho!"" said the wise old owl, While the guinea-hen cluttered off chuckling To tell all the rest of the fowl. "
612,THE NEW DUCKLING,"""I should like a more elegant figure,"" That child of a duck went on. ""I should like to grow bigger and bigger, Until I could swallow a swan. "
613,THE NEW DUCKLING,"""I _won't_ be the bond slave of habit, I _won't_ have these webs on my toes. I want to run round like a rabbit, A rabbit as red as a rose. "
614,THE NEW DUCKLING,"""I _don't_ want to waddle like mother, Or quack like my silly old dad. I want to be utterly other, And _frightfully_ modern and mad."" "
615,THE NEW DUCKLING,"""Do you know,"" said the turkey, ""you're quacking! There's a fox creeping up thro' the rye; And, if you're not utterly lacking, You'll make for that duck-pond. Good-bye!"" "
616,THE NEW DUCKLING,"""I won't,"" said the duckling. ""I'll lift him A beautiful song, like a sheep; And when I have--as it were--biffed him, I'll give him my feathers to keep."" "
617,THE NEW DUCKLING,"Now the curious end of this fable, So far as the rest ascertained, Though they searched from the barn to the stable, Was that _only his feathers remained_. "
618,THE NEW DUCKLING,"So he _wasn't_ the bond slave of habit, And he _didn't_ have webs on his toes; And _perhaps_ he runs round like a rabbit, A rabbit as red as a rose. "

621,THE MAN WHO DISCOVERED THE USE OF A CHAIR,"The man who discovered the use of a chair, _Odds--bobs-- What a wonderful man!_ He used to sit down on it, tearing his hair, Till he thought of a highly original plan. For years he had sat on his chair, like you, _Quite--still! But his looks were grim_ For he wished to be famous (as great men do) And nobody ever would listen to him. "
622,THE MAN WHO DISCOVERED THE USE OF A CHAIR,"Now he went one night to a dinner of state _Hear! hear! In the proud Guildhall!_ And he sat on his chair, and he ate from a plate; But nobody heard his opinions at all; "
623,THE MAN WHO DISCOVERED THE USE OF A CHAIR,"There were ten fat aldermen down for a speech (_Grouse! Grouse! What a dreary bird!_) With five fair minutes allotted to each, But never a moment for him to be heard. "
624,THE MAN WHO DISCOVERED THE USE OF A CHAIR,"But, each being ready to talk, I suppose, _Order! Order!_ They cried, _for the Chair!_ And, much to their wonder, our friend arose And fastened his eye on the eye of the Mayor. "
625,THE MAN WHO DISCOVERED THE USE OF A CHAIR,"""We have come,"" he said, ""to the fourteenth course! ""_High--time, for the Chair_,"" he said. Then, with both of his hands, and with all of his force, He hurled his chair at the Lord Mayor's head. "
626,THE MAN WHO DISCOVERED THE USE OF A CHAIR,It missed that head by the width of a hair. _Gee--whizz! What a horrible squeak!_ But it crashed through the big bay-window there And smashed a bus into Wednesday week. 
627,THE MAN WHO DISCOVERED THE USE OF A CHAIR,"And the very next day, in the decorous Times (_Great--Guns-- How the headlines ran!_) In spite of the kings and the wars and the crimes, There were five full columns about that man. "

634,COTTON-WOOL,"When you see a clever man Run as quickly as you can. You must never, never, never Think that Socrates was clever. The cleverest thing I ever knew Now cracks walnuts at the Zoo. _Children, let a wandering fool Stuff your ears with cotton-wool._ "
635,COTTON-WOOL,"Homer could not scintillate. Milton, too, was merely great. That's a very different matter From talking like a frantic hatter. Keats and Shelley had no tricks. Wordsworth never climbed up sticks. _Children, let a wandering fool Stuff your ears with cotton-wool._ "
636,COTTON-WOOL,"Lincoln would create a gloom In many a London drawing-room; He'd be silent at their wit, He would never laugh at it. When they kissed Salome's toes, I think he'd snort and blow his nose. _Children, let a wandering fool Stuff your ears with cotton-wool._ "
637,COTTON-WOOL,"They'd curse him for a silly clown, They'd drum him out of London town. Professor Flunkey, the historian, Would say he was a dull Victorian. Matthew, Mark, and Luke and John, Bless the bed I rest upon. _Children, let a wandering fool Stuff your ears with cotton-wool._ Amen. "

652,THE REWARD OF SONG,"_Why do we make our music?_ Oh, blind dark strings reply: Because we dwell in a strange land And remember a lost sky. We ask no leaf of the laurel, We know what fame is worth; But our songs break out of our winter As the flowers break out on the earth. "
653,THE REWARD OF SONG,"And we dream of the unknown comrade, In the days when we lie dead, Who shall open our book in the sunlight, And read, as ourselves have read, On a lonely hill, by a firwood, With whispering seas below, And murmur a song we made him Ages and ages ago. "
654,THE REWARD OF SONG,"If making his may-time sweeter With dews of our own dead may, One pulse of our own dead heart-strings Awake in his heart that day, We would pray for no richer guerdon, No praise from the careless throng; For song is the cry of a lover In quest of an answering song. "
655,THE REWARD OF SONG,"As a child might run to his elders With news of an opening flower We should walk with our young companion And talk to his heart for an hour, As once by my own green firwood, And once by a Western sea, Thank God, my own good comrades Have walked and talked with me. "
656,THE REWARD OF SONG,"Too mighty to make men sorrow, Too weak to heal their pain (Though they that remember the hawthorn May find their heaven again), We are moved by a deeper hunger; We are bound by a stronger cord; For love is the heart of our music, And love is its one reward. "
