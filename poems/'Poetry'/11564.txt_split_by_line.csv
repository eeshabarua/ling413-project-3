41,PREFACE.,Whoever has read the Preface to the FARMER'S BOY will hardly fail of
42,PREFACE.,recollecting the Name of NATHANIEL BLOOMFIELD; the Author of the POEMS
43,PREFACE.,here offer'd to The Public.
44,PREFACE.,
45,PREFACE.,"It will be recollected that he there appears, with his Brother GEORGE"
46,PREFACE.,"BLOOMFIELD, standing in the place of the Father, whom they had early"
47,PREFACE.,"lost, to their younger Brother ROBERT."
48,PREFACE.,
49,PREFACE.,"It is natural to suppose that this brotherly interference, and it's"
50,PREFACE.,"consequences, greatly and advantageously influenc'd the dispositions,"
51,PREFACE.,"pursuits, and habits of thought and conduct, of all three of the"
52,PREFACE.,Brothers.--And it is the more exemplary when it is consider'd how young
53,PREFACE.,the two eldest were at that time.
54,PREFACE.,
55,PREFACE.,It is an encouraging instance how much may be effected for each other
56,PREFACE.,"by the poor and uneducated, if they have prudence, activity, and kind"
57,PREFACE.,"affections; and how unexpectedly, and to an extent far beyond apparent"
58,PREFACE.,"probability, success is given by Providence to virtuous and benevolent"
59,PREFACE.,efforts.
60,PREFACE.,
61,PREFACE.,"Beyond question, the Brothers of this Family are all extraordinary Men:"
62,PREFACE.,and perhaps every one of them is more so than he would have been without
63,PREFACE.,"the fraternal concord which has animated them all, and multiplied the"
64,PREFACE.,powers of all by union and sympathy.
65,PREFACE.,
66,PREFACE.,"Of NATHANIEL, as of ROBERT, my Account shall be taken from"
67,PREFACE.,"communications by Letter, made at my request by Mr. GEORGE BLOOMFIELD."
68,PREFACE.,
69,PREFACE.,NATHANIEL BLOOMFIELD was born 23d Feb.[1] 1759.
70,PREFACE.,
71,PREFACE.,"He was the 3d Child and 2d Son of GEORGE BLOOMFIELD, of Honington: and"
72,PREFACE.,"was deprived of his Father, by the Small-pox, when he was eight years"
73,PREFACE.,"old. Like ROBERT, he learnt to read and write of his MOTHER: and had,"
74,PREFACE.,"like him, his farther instructions in Writing, and was taught the"
75,PREFACE.,"first Rules of Arithmetic, by Mr. RODWELL, of Ixworth[2]: where also"
76,PREFACE.,he seems to have had some instruction in Grammar. But his Mother being
77,PREFACE.,"then a widow, his Grandfather (Mr. ROBIN MANBY) kindly bound him"
78,PREFACE.,"Apprentice to Mr. HAYLETT, a Tailor of Market-Harling: of which"
79,PREFACE.,business the Father of the BLOOMFIELDS had been.
80,PREFACE.,
81,PREFACE.,He was here very kindly treated: and was found to be an excellent
82,PREFACE.,Apprentice.
83,PREFACE.,
84,PREFACE.,"While here he learnt Church Music, (one of the great consolations of"
85,PREFACE.,energetic and pensive minds) and sung in a company which was conducted
86,PREFACE.,"by Mr. SYDER. But when his voice broke, he could make no figure among"
87,PREFACE.,"them: for it was not only a Bass of extremely narrow compass, but weak"
88,PREFACE.,and tremulous.
89,PREFACE.,
90,PREFACE.,This latter defect of voice was observ'd in THOMSON: and perhaps it may
91,PREFACE.,"arise sometimes not from a fault in the natural quality of the voice,"
92,PREFACE.,but from exceeding sensibility to Poetry and Music.
93,PREFACE.,
94,PREFACE.,When about 16 or 17 years of age he entered with the fervor of a
95,PREFACE.,"vigorous and thoughtful mind into the study of Religion, on the"
96,PREFACE.,principles of the Church of England: and added to his study of it
97,PREFACE.,"what is the great end, the practice of Religion as a rule of conduct"
98,PREFACE.,and life.
99,PREFACE.,
100,PREFACE.,At a stall at Harling Fair he met with a Practical Catechism: the
101,PREFACE.,"Author's name, PRATT: and at the same time he made the acquisition of a"
102,PREFACE.,large volume of TILLOTSON'S Sermons. Probably the Folio Edition of the
103,PREFACE.,Sermons of that excellent Man and Writer: so distinguish'd by his
104,PREFACE.,"Piety, uniform, mild, and rational; the morality of his excellent"
105,PREFACE.,Discourses; their simplicity and clearness; and the sweetness and
106,PREFACE.,"persuasiveness of manner. These, and other religious Tracts, he bought:"
107,PREFACE.,"and ""the last"" (Tillotson) ""he lent,"" says Mr. GEORGE BLOOMFIELD, ""to"
108,PREFACE.,me. I receiv'd many excellent Letters from him on that subject: and they
109,PREFACE.,had greater weight on my mind than if they had been written by an elder
110,PREFACE.,"hand."""
111,PREFACE.,
112,PREFACE.,When his Apprenticeship expir'd he came to LONDON: and expected to
113,PREFACE.,"find his Brother GEORGE there. But GEORGE had taken a trip, ""or tramp,"
114,PREFACE.,"as it is called,"" into Kent. They however soon met in LONDON: ""and"
115,PREFACE.,"there never lived"" (adds GEORGE) ""a more pleasant acquaintance than"
116,PREFACE.,"he prov'd."""
117,PREFACE.,
118,PREFACE.,It was some years before he could procure work in LONDON sufficient to
119,PREFACE.,"support him through the dead Months. He us'd therefore, when he found"
120,PREFACE.,"trade dull in Town, to go into the Country."
121,PREFACE.,
122,PREFACE.,"And thus, while at Woolwich, he became acquainted with CHARLOTTE"
123,PREFACE.,"NOBLE, whom he MARRIED 4th March, 1787; he being then in his 28th, and"
124,PREFACE.,she in her 17th year. Her Mother was a Widow: who kept a small General
125,PREFACE.,"Shop. Her Brother-in-law GEORGE, in speaking of this union, says, ""There"
126,PREFACE.,"perhaps never liv'd a Woman who possess'd a better temper: and he has,"
127,PREFACE.,"though very poor, been exceedingly happy."" For myself, I wish, in"
128,PREFACE.,"transcribing this account, that those who think riches so essential to"
129,PREFACE.,"happiness that they will take no step in life, nor suffer their hearts"
130,PREFACE.,"or their understandings to have any influence with them, if the"
131,PREFACE.,"acquisition of riches seems likely to be delayed or endanger'd, would"
132,PREFACE.,"consider that the Family of the BLOOMFIELDS has been happy, and has"
133,PREFACE.,"excell'd, upon very different principles. And if we would compare the"
134,PREFACE.,thousands in every situation of Life to whom what is called prosperity
135,PREFACE.,"is a snare, a burthen and a curse, with those who are happy with mere"
136,PREFACE.,"necessaries, and those with difficulty obtain'd; ... happy by their"
137,PREFACE.,Affections and their Virtues; by improv'd and generous and tender
138,PREFACE.,"Feelings; by Hope amid difficulties, and Confidence in Heaven amid"
139,PREFACE.,"trials and distresses, ... it might be seen and felt that there is more"
140,PREFACE.,"of folly in the wisdom of the world, than those who place Wisdom in"
141,PREFACE.,"the accumulation of superfluities, to the neglect of the most natural"
142,PREFACE.,"Blessings, and often in violation of the clearest Duties, either of"
143,PREFACE.,"Justice or of Benevolence, may be willing to acknowledge."
144,PREFACE.,
145,PREFACE.,He has two Children living:--ELIZABETH; born 11th Jul. 1789; GEORGE;
146,PREFACE.,"4th Febr. 1797. ""He lost,"" adds his Brother, ""two sweet Boys: who both"
147,PREFACE.,"died within a few days of each other, by that dreadful disease the"
148,PREFACE.,"SMALL-POX;"" which, while this Preface was in the Press, has been fatal"
149,PREFACE.,"to another promising Child, THOMAS; born Aug. 1799. The Father,"
150,PREFACE.,"oppress'd with grief, reproaches himself for not having inoculated this"
151,PREFACE.,"Child with the Small-Pox. But when it is consider'd how formidable,"
152,PREFACE.,"after two such Losses, the SMALL-POX in any form must appear to"
153,PREFACE.,"affectionate Parents, I think it will be evident that he is too severe"
154,PREFACE.,to himself in this reproach. The inoculated SMALL-POX is sometimes
155,PREFACE.,"fatal: had he inoculated the Child he would have reproach'd himself,"
156,PREFACE.,"and still with more feeling than justice, for so doing."
157,PREFACE.,
158,PREFACE.,He had read but little Poetry when he came to LONDON: but he had not
159,PREFACE.,"been long there before he was struck, looking, as was his custom, at"
160,PREFACE.,"Books on a stall, with the Title of NIGHT THOUGHTS. ""He had never heard"
161,PREFACE.,"of it before: but it's name was an irresistible charm to his melancholy,"
162,PREFACE.,enquiring mind. This has been ever his favourite Book. He would have
163,PREFACE.,bought it had it been double the price. And as he possesses an
164,PREFACE.,"uncommonly retentive memory, he us'd to repeat great part of it by"
165,PREFACE.,"rote in his walks with his Brothers. He afterwards read MILTON."""
166,PREFACE.,
167,PREFACE.,"Such a Memory, and the study of two such Authors with poetic enthusiasm,"
168,PREFACE.,may in part account for what exceedingly surpriz'd me in reading the
169,PREFACE.,"MSS. of THE ESSAY ON WAR:--a greater mastery in the mechanism, and"
170,PREFACE.,"greater power of numbers, than I should have almost thought possible"
171,PREFACE.,in the first attempt in BLANK VERSE; even to a person of the best
172,PREFACE.,education.
173,PREFACE.,
174,PREFACE.,"He read too, GOLDSMITH and FIELDING. And he added to these some of our"
175,PREFACE.,English Poets as they fell in his way. Among these THOMSON could hardly
176,PREFACE.,"fail to be: but Mr. G. BLOOMFIELD remarks, ""he never was so struck with"
177,PREFACE.,"THOMSON as I should have expected."""
178,PREFACE.,
179,PREFACE.,"While single, he made it the amusement of his evenings to read"
180,PREFACE.,"_Entick's Dictionary_, and write down every word of which he wish'd to"
181,PREFACE.,remember the spelling or the meaning. He has often said that since his
182,PREFACE.,"buying of the Sermons in his early youth, he had never bought for his"
183,PREFACE.,own reading any but poetical Books: and when he could get hold of any
184,PREFACE.,"miscellaneous Book, he read first the Poetry, and after look'd at no"
185,PREFACE.,other part.
186,PREFACE.,
187,PREFACE.,"With this turn of Mind and habit of reading, that he has through Life"
188,PREFACE.,indulg'd in poetical effusions will be no matter of surprize. But be has
189,PREFACE.,"more than once said to his Brother GEORGE in Letters, that it was the"
190,PREFACE.,success of ROBERT that encouraged him to attempt an _Essay on War:_ a
191,PREFACE.,subject on which he had occupied his thoughts a great length of time.
192,PREFACE.,
193,PREFACE.,"""I remember,"" says his Brother, ""nothing particular of his infancy:"
194,PREFACE.,"except the great share of bashfulness (or, as a Philosopher perhaps"
195,PREFACE.,"would say, pride) which he possess'd in common with the rest of the"
196,PREFACE.,"Family.... Exceedingly mild in his temper and kind to his play-mates,"
197,PREFACE.,"he was very apt in learning."""
198,PREFACE.,
199,PREFACE.,For the last 15 years his own Account is that he has certainty read
200,PREFACE.,but little: his Family having claim'd his utmost exertions; and his
201,PREFACE.,business allowing little leisure. And what leisure he had being
202,PREFACE.,generally employed in walking with his Children. Untill last Summer he
203,PREFACE.,was a Journeyman Tailor: but has since been a MASTER in a small way.
204,PREFACE.,"If therefore he appears to possess any knowledge of a litterary nature,"
205,PREFACE.,it must be all from the stores of Memory.
206,PREFACE.,
207,PREFACE.,"He at present lives at No. 19, Dagget Court, Broker Row, Moorfields,"
208,PREFACE.,London. He is (says Mr. G. BLOOMFIELD) about 5F. 3I. high[3]: of a dark
209,PREFACE.,"complexion, and dark gray eyes: he has lost the hair from the top of"
210,PREFACE.,"his head, which gives him the appearance of Age. Though remarkable for"
211,PREFACE.,"talking little, so as to have the name of a man of few words, he is,"
212,PREFACE.,"on occasion, a chearful companion: and though generally pensive and"
213,PREFACE.,"melancholy, ever kind-hearted."
214,PREFACE.,
215,PREFACE.,"""As a Husband and Father, his character is certainly exemplary. And few"
216,PREFACE.,men pass through Life so smoothly. Though commonly working with a number
217,PREFACE.,"of shop-mates, he has such a philosophical command of temper, that he"
218,PREFACE.,"never disputes; nor concerns himself with the disputes of others, unless"
219,PREFACE.,"they refer to him for a decision."""
220,PREFACE.,
221,PREFACE.,Thus far the Account by his Brother: who had observ'd in a former
222,PREFACE.,"Letter, that with respect to Temper, what he should otherwise have to"
223,PREFACE.,"speak of NATHANIEL, he had in a great measure said already of ROBERT."
224,PREFACE.,"Such a coincidence in mild and simple manners, amiable and good"
225,PREFACE.,"disposition, is pleasing to remark any where: and additionally so when"
226,PREFACE.,it relates to Men who have each original and characteristic Genius; and
227,PREFACE.,"when the testimony is given by a Brother so capable of judging, and who"
228,PREFACE.,"has had such continued experience from their very early Life, of the"
229,PREFACE.,Disposition and Character of both.
230,PREFACE.,
231,PREFACE.,"Having spoken thus far of the AUTHOR, from the best authority, it"
232,PREFACE.,remains for me to say something briefly of these his WORKS.
233,PREFACE.,
234,PREFACE.,*       *       *       *       *
235,PREFACE.,
236,PREFACE.,"Early in the Spring of 1801, I saw in MSS. HONINGTON-GREEN, and the"
237,PREFACE.,"ESSAY ON WAR[4]. I communicated them to Mr. GEDGE, Printer, of BURY;"
238,PREFACE.,who had been a zealous and active Friend to THE FARMER'S BOY: on reading
239,PREFACE.,"them, he wanted no time for deliberation, but offer'd at once to print"
240,PREFACE.,"them for the benefit of the Author, at his own risque. I had known his"
241,PREFACE.,"accuracy as a Printer: of which, and of neat Typography, I flatter"
242,PREFACE.,myself this Publication will be a proof. I had no difficulty to adopt
243,PREFACE.,"the proposal: and gladly offer'd, on my part, what little preparation"
244,PREFACE.,(very little indeed it was) might be necessary of the MSS. for the
245,PREFACE.,Press; (or rather in it's progress through it); and to revise and
246,PREFACE.,correct the Proofs.
247,PREFACE.,
248,PREFACE.,My province has been quite of a similar kind in this instance as it
249,PREFACE.,"was in that of Mr. ROBERT BLOOMFIELD: little corrections, in point"
250,PREFACE.,of Orthography; and still fewer of Grammar: sometimes of Diction; and
251,PREFACE.,sometimes of Versification. For some of the best of these emendations
252,PREFACE.,"I have been indebted to one, in mentioning of whom I should have had"
253,PREFACE.,an affectionate Pride: and have more in that Modesty which forbids the
254,PREFACE.,"mention. They are, as I have said, few of any kind: For of emendations I"
255,PREFACE.,have been anxiously sparing. Little was requisite: and more than was so
256,PREFACE.,would have been blameable. I rely on the original MSS. being preserv'd:
257,PREFACE.,"which on this, as on the former occasion, will speak for itself."
258,PREFACE.,
259,PREFACE.,I have said what I thought of THE FARMER'S BOY. It is a truely
260,PREFACE.,agricultural Poem: it's originality and vivid representation of
261,PREFACE.,"immediate Nature manifest themselves in the whole Design, and in every"
262,PREFACE.,page. It will live with the works of HESIOD and THEOCRITUS; of VIRGIL
263,PREFACE.,"and THOMSON. I was nearly as much assur'd of this from the first, and so"
264,PREFACE.,"express'd myself, as the event could assure me. I will now say with the"
265,PREFACE.,same freedom what I think of the ESSAY ON WAR.
266,PREFACE.,
267,PREFACE.,I regard it as a Poem of extraordinary vigor and originality: in
268,PREFACE.,"Thought, Plan, Conduct, Language, and Versification. I think it has much"
269,PREFACE.,"indeed of the philosophic character, poetic spirit, force of coloring,"
270,PREFACE.,"energy and pathos, which distinguish LUCRETIUS. Of the justness and"
271,PREFACE.,spirit of the VERSIFICATION I have already spoken.
272,PREFACE.,
273,PREFACE.,"The PRINCIPLE of the ESSAY ON WAR appears to me, I will own, more"
274,PREFACE.,"paradoxical than I should think, to judge from their conduct, it can"
275,PREFACE.,appear to the ruling part at least of Mankind in general. I indulge the
276,PREFACE.,hope and expectation that WAR shall one day be universally and finally
277,PREFACE.,"extinguish'd. But I will confess also, that appearances would tempt us"
278,PREFACE.,to apprehend that day is far distant. And while we make War for Sport on
279,PREFACE.,"useful, generous, inoffensive Animals, it is not easy to imagine that we"
280,PREFACE.,shall cease to make War on one another.
281,PREFACE.,
282,PREFACE.,"But whether the Principle of the Poem be well or ill-founded, I can"
283,PREFACE.,"hardly imagine any abstract proposition to be more poetically, more"
284,PREFACE.,"forcibly, or more comprehensively maintain'd. And I am either ignorant"
285,PREFACE.,"wherein Genius consists, or it is manifest in the Idea, the Style and"
286,PREFACE.,"Numbers, the Design and Conduct of this Poem."
287,PREFACE.,
288,PREFACE.,Of HONINGTON GREEN I am to speak next. And here it may be right to
289,PREFACE.,"obviate some prejudice against the Poem, which, in the minds of several,"
290,PREFACE.,may arise from the subject. I am not an Enemy to Enclosures: if the
291,PREFACE.,"RIGHTS and INTERESTS of the POOR, and of SMALL OWNERS, be very carefully"
292,PREFACE.,"guarded, an ENCLOSURE may be a common Benefit. However, it is very"
293,PREFACE.,"liable to become otherwise. But be an Enclosure good or bad, (and every"
294,PREFACE.,"Man has a right to his opinion, and to support it by argument, on this"
295,PREFACE.,subject and every other) there are particular circumstances and
296,PREFACE.,considerations which stand clear of the scope of the general question.
297,PREFACE.,"The Spot which is the subject of the Ballad is less, I believe, than"
298,PREFACE.,Half an Acre. It did certainly ornament the Village; independent of a
299,PREFACE.,just and laudable partiality in the Author. Thus it would have seem'd to
300,PREFACE.,the casual glance of a stranger. To the BLOOMFIELDS every circumstance
301,PREFACE.,"gave it peculiar endearment. There the Author of 'THE FARMER'S BOY,' and"
302,PREFACE.,"of these POEMS, first drew breath. There grew the first Daisies which"
303,PREFACE.,their feet pressed in childhood. On this little Green their Parents
304,PREFACE.,look'd with delight: and the Children caught the affection; and learn'd
305,PREFACE.,to love it as soon as they lov'd any thing. By it's smallness and it's
306,PREFACE.,situation it was no object: and could have been left out of Enclosure
307,PREFACE.,"without detriment to the General Plan, or to any individual Interest."
308,PREFACE.,"I wish it had: and most who love Poetry, and respect Genius, and are"
309,PREFACE.,"anxious to preserve the little innocent Gratifications of the Poor,"
310,PREFACE.,will have the same wish.
311,PREFACE.,
312,PREFACE.,"As a poetical effusion, it strikes me that it has the tone, simplicity,"
313,PREFACE.,"and sweetness, and pleasing Melancholy of the Ballad. There is a stroke"
314,PREFACE.,or two of indignant severity: but the general character is such as I
315,PREFACE.,"have describ'd. And with filial Gratitude and Love there is blended,"
316,PREFACE.,"in the close, that turn for Reflection which is so remarkable in this"
317,PREFACE.,Author.... I wish'd and recommended that some at least of the ornaments
318,PREFACE.,of 'THE FARMER'S BOY' should be sketches of local scenery: knowing
319,PREFACE.,"how much more interesting they would have been, and how much more"
320,PREFACE.,appropriate to the Poem. In that recommendation I was not successful:
321,PREFACE.,"but I am glad, in this instance, to see a faithful and agreeable Sketch"
322,PREFACE.,"of Honington-Green from a very young pencil[5]. It will be remember'd,"
323,PREFACE.,"at a far remote Period, that the double Cottage at the end of the Green"
324,PREFACE.,"was the Birth-place of the BLOOMFIELDS. It is still, (and may it yet be"
325,PREFACE.,long so) the habitation of their Mother: and has been repair'd lately
326,PREFACE.,by ROBERT. And I much doubt whether any House or Green will see two such
327,PREFACE.,Poets born of the same Parents.
328,PREFACE.,
329,PREFACE.,"THE CULPRIT is the next in this Collection, and I had not seen it, nor"
330,PREFACE.,"was it written, when I saw the two first. They decided my Opinion; and"
331,PREFACE.,"had no more appeared, they would have been publish'd alone; as they"
332,PREFACE.,abundantly deserved.
333,PREFACE.,
334,PREFACE.,THE CULPRIT strikes me as an original and highly affecting Poem. The
335,PREFACE.,very attempt to sketch the successive conflicting feelings of one thus
336,PREFACE.,circumstanc'd is no common effort. And what compass of thought; what
337,PREFACE.,energy of expression! ... I do not always admit the justness of the
338,PREFACE.,"arguments. But it is a Soliloquy in character: and in judging of it,"
339,PREFACE.,"as in all pieces of representative Poetry (as Mr. DYER, in his lately"
340,PREFACE.,publish'd ESSAY has well term'd it) the imagin'd situation ought to be
341,PREFACE.,consider'd. And it strikes me as closing with a true and aweful Pathos:
342,PREFACE.,not often equall'd.
343,PREFACE.,
344,PREFACE.,"The YORKSHIRE DIP is, I think, the result of that active but melancholy"
345,PREFACE.,"Fancy, which can travel far into views of Life and Nature from a slight"
346,PREFACE.,occasion. It has a mixture of the Sportive which deepens the impression
347,PREFACE.,"of it's melancholy Close. I could have wish'd, as I have said in a short"
348,PREFACE.,"Note, the Conclusion had been otherwise. The sours of Life less offend"
349,PREFACE.,my Taste than its sweets delight it. But when I think what NATHANIEL
350,PREFACE.,"must have felt in passing through Life, I more respect the Chearfulness"
351,PREFACE.,"and habitual Vigor of his Mind, than I am dispos'd to be out of humor"
352,PREFACE.,with occasional gloom.
353,PREFACE.,
354,PREFACE.,LOVE'S TRIUMPH differs as much in manner as in subject from those which
355,PREFACE.,precede it. Yet a vein of pensive and philosophic thought flows here
356,PREFACE.,also. The SONG OF BALDWIN is well adapted to soothe the fears and the
357,PREFACE.,"discontents of Poverty: and to convince those who have not learnt it,"
358,PREFACE.,"that wealth, and rank, and power, and unlimited indulgence, are not such"
359,PREFACE.,Blessings as they are imagin'd to be at a distance: nor Poverty such an
360,PREFACE.,"Evil, that the first and best Blessings of Nature should be therefore"
361,PREFACE.,thrown aside in despair.
362,PREFACE.,
363,PREFACE.,I may doubt on the expediency of the SONG OF BALDWIN being in a
364,PREFACE.,different measure; but I can not doubt of the general merit of the Poem.
365,PREFACE.,
366,PREFACE.,"The PROVERBS, like other compositions of this kind, must rest chiefly on"
367,PREFACE.,"their moral Justness, Utility, Simplicity, and Conciseness, rather than"
368,PREFACE.,on poetic Excellence: though neither in form nor coloring are they
369,PREFACE.,deficient of that compos'd and grave Beauty which the Nature of the
370,PREFACE.,Subject and Composition admits.
371,PREFACE.,
372,PREFACE.,"MORE BREAD AND CHEESE contains the Principle of the ESSAY ON WAR, and of"
373,PREFACE.,"a celebrated ESSAY ON POPULATION, which I dare say the Author never saw."
374,PREFACE.,"It is strong, characteristic; and original: and although in the measure"
375,PREFACE.,"of the humorous Ballad, has much nerve and energy[6]."
376,PREFACE.,
377,PREFACE.,I have now a Remark to make which relates generally to the
378,PREFACE.,"Versification. We may observe of HONINGTON GREEN, and most of the Poems"
379,PREFACE.,"in rhyme in this Collection, that they are strongly accentuated: and if"
380,PREFACE.,"red with a close attention to accent and emphasis, the rhythm is musical"
381,PREFACE.,and energetic; where to a careless Reader it might appear harsh and
382,PREFACE.,untuneable.
383,PREFACE.,
384,PREFACE.,"The LYRIC ELEGY which concludes this little Collection is, I think,"
385,PREFACE.,animated and pathetic in no common degree. On the Merits of VACCINE
386,PREFACE.,INOCULATION I do not think myself qualify'd to offer an opinion. Great
387,PREFACE.,Doubts have been entertain'd concerning it by medical Men of Abilities
388,PREFACE.,and Experience. Objections apparently strong were urg'd; and of various
389,PREFACE.,kinds. At present it has had Declarations in it's favor from among the
390,PREFACE.,most distinguish'd of it's Opposers. And it seems to have little short
391,PREFACE.,"of a general reception in the medical World.... Time and Experience,"
392,PREFACE.,"the great Test of Truth in such instances, must determine for or against"
393,PREFACE.,"it. But, important as the Question is, poetical Merit is comparatively"
394,PREFACE.,independent on the correctness of a philosophic System or Hypothesis.
395,PREFACE.,"And reflecting on his former Losses and present Calamities, the Author"
396,PREFACE.,could not but feel a deep Interest in whatever seem'd likely to obviate
397,PREFACE.,such an Evil to others.
398,PREFACE.,
399,PREFACE.,I have observ'd some rather striking coincidences with VIRGIL and
400,PREFACE.,LUCRETIUS. I might have pointed out more; and to other classic
401,PREFACE.,Authors. But I should have extended this Preface too far. At the same
402,PREFACE.,"time, such a concurrence in the Sentiments and Expressions of Genius in"
403,PREFACE.,"very distant Ages, and under widely different Circumstances, is always"
404,PREFACE.,"interesting, even where it can be resolv'd with Certainty, or"
405,PREFACE.,"Probability, into IMITATION: and much more so, when, as in these Poems,"
406,PREFACE.,it is certain that it CAN NOT.
407,PREFACE.,
408,PREFACE.,I have very few Words more to say in presenting this little Volume to
409,PREFACE.,the PUBLIC. Specimens they will find in it of such different kinds of
410,PREFACE.,"Composition, as the same individual rarely can attempt with success. Yet"
411,PREFACE.,"through great diversity of Style, Dissimilarity of Measure, and Variety"
412,PREFACE.,"of Sentiment and Subject, may be seen the same Mind: and Traces of the"
413,PREFACE.,"same Manner, and that manner peculiarly characteristic...a mixture of"
414,PREFACE.,"contemplative equanimity, of incidental gleams of vivacity; of energy"
415,PREFACE.,"frequently pathetic, sometimes sarcastic, and not seldom sublime. And we"
416,PREFACE.,"have here an additional proof, that a true poetic Spirit, in whatever"
417,PREFACE.,"Breast it inhabits, will create Thoughts, Language, and Numbers, worthy"
418,PREFACE.,"of the Muse, however unfavourable the occupation and habits of Life."
419,PREFACE.,
420,PREFACE.,"Mr. NATHANIEL BLOOMFIELD was not without his fears, however, lest it"
421,PREFACE.,"should be thought, that, although THE MUSE can visit a SHEPHERD'S BOY,"
422,PREFACE.,there may be some employments which exclude her influence. That a TAYLOR
423,PREFACE.,"should be a POET, he doubted, might appear too startling an Assertion."
424,PREFACE.,"And he had said accordingly to his Brother GEORGE, in a Letter, when"
425,PREFACE.,"this Publication was first going to Press, ""I want you to exclude the"
426,PREFACE.,word _Taylor_. Let there be no such Word in the Book. But perhaps I am
427,PREFACE.,too late. I know there is in the public Mind as great contempt for him
428,PREFACE.,"who bears the appellation of _Taylor_, as STERNE has made old SHANDY"
429,PREFACE.,"have for SIMKIN, NECKEY, or TRISTRAM. How many CAESARS and POMPEYS, says"
430,PREFACE.,"he, by mere inspiration of the names, have been rendered worthy of them?"
431,PREFACE.,And how many are there who might have done exceedingly well in the
432,PREFACE.,"World, had not their Characters and Spirits been totally depress'd and"
433,PREFACE.,Nicodemiz'd; and I will add (says Mr. N. BLOOMFIELD) taylor'd into
434,PREFACE.,"nothing? In the REHEARSAL, the Author, to make the most ridiculous"
435,PREFACE.,"part of it still more ridiculous, tells us, that it was written to a"
436,PREFACE.,"Taylor, and by a Taylor's Wife. And even the discerning SPECTATOR"
437,PREFACE.,has given into this common-place raillery in the Monkey's Letter to her
438,PREFACE.,"Mistress. He has made the Soul which inhabited Pug's Body, in recounting"
439,PREFACE.,"the humiliating State it had formerly been in, say, that he had been a"
440,PREFACE.,"Taylor, a Shrimp, and a Tom-tit. It is from these causes, as well as"
441,PREFACE.,from the habits and appearance contracted by a recluse and sedentary
442,PREFACE.,"Life, that, in the enlighten'd, as well as the ignorant, the ideas of"
443,PREFACE.,"Taylor and Insignificance are inseparably link'd together."""
444,PREFACE.,
445,PREFACE.,"I prevail'd, notwithstanding, that this word, whose anti-poetic"
446,PREFACE.,"influence is so dreaded, should be in the Book. About half a Century"
447,PREFACE.,"ago, there seem'd a degree of incredulity as to the possibility of"
448,PREFACE.,"Courage in a Taylor. ELLIOT'S LIGHT HORSE, at that time compos'd of"
449,PREFACE.,Taylor-Volunteers. effectually overcame that prejudice. It remain'd
450,PREFACE.,"to dissolve another still more irrational prepossession, that a Taylor"
451,PREFACE.,cannot be a Poet. And this Volume will be a victorious Host against an
452,PREFACE.,Army of such Prejudices. Indeed the Force is greater than such a Combat
453,PREFACE.,"requires: for stubborn as other Prejudices may still be, our litterary"
454,PREFACE.,"Prejudices have, in this Age, been rapidly giving way to Candour,"
455,PREFACE.,"Reason, Common-Sense, and the Evidence of Fact. We have long known that"
456,PREFACE.,a Scotch Plough-Boy and a Milk-Woman[7] could still be Poets of high
457,PREFACE.,and almost singular Excellence. And if Improbability were any thing
458,PREFACE.,"against Fact, it would be far more improbable, that two Brothers should"
459,PREFACE.,"be such Poets as ROBERT and NATHANIEL BLOOMFIELD are, than that a Taylor"
460,PREFACE.,should be a Poet. It remains then for Prejudice to vanish like Mists
461,PREFACE.,before the Sun: while the two BROTHERS sociably ascend PARNASSUS
462,PREFACE.,"together; higher than ever Brothers have climbed before: I might add,"
463,PREFACE.,each of them to an height which but few have ever reach'd[8].

555,ESSAY ON WAR,"Man's sad necessity, destructive War,"
556,ESSAY ON WAR,"Sweeps to the grave the surplus of his sons,"
557,ESSAY ON WAR,Where'er the kindly clime and soil invite
558,ESSAY ON WAR,To Love; and multiply the Human Race.
559,ESSAY ON WAR,"Around the World, in every happier spot"
560,ESSAY ON WAR,Where Earth spontaneous gives nutritious fruits.
561,ESSAY ON WAR,"Her softest verdure courting human feet,"
562,ESSAY ON WAR,"And mossy grot's, beneath protecting shades,"
563,ESSAY ON WAR,"The Stranger's envy, the Possessor's pride;"
564,ESSAY ON WAR,"There, as increasing numbers throng each bower."
565,ESSAY ON WAR,Frequent and fatal rivalships arise;
566,ESSAY ON WAR,And ruthless War erects his hideous crest.
567,ESSAY ON WAR,Soon as Appropriation's iron hand
568,ESSAY ON WAR,Assays to grasp the Produce of the Earth;
569,ESSAY ON WAR,"And youths assert hereditary power,"
570,ESSAY ON WAR,"Propriety exclusive, and in arms"
571,ESSAY ON WAR,"League to defend their patrimonial rights,"
572,ESSAY ON WAR,Indisputable claim of Fruits and Fields
573,ESSAY ON WAR,"Contending, oft their massive clubs they raise"
574,ESSAY ON WAR,"Against each other's life: often, alas,"
575,ESSAY ON WAR,The needy cravings of the unportion'd poor
576,ESSAY ON WAR,Provoke their jealous wrath; relentlessly
577,ESSAY ON WAR,"Tenacious of their store, they shut him out,"
578,ESSAY ON WAR,"'Midst desart Famine, and ferocious Beasts,"
579,ESSAY ON WAR,To guard his life and till the steril soil;
580,ESSAY ON WAR,And thus extend the range of human feet.
581,ESSAY ON WAR,"Still as Experience, in her tardy school,"
582,ESSAY ON WAR,Instructs the Shepherd and the Husbandman
583,ESSAY ON WAR,"To great increase their flocks and herds to rear,"
584,ESSAY ON WAR,"To till the ground, and plant the fruitful tree"
585,ESSAY ON WAR,"In slow progression rising into use,"
586,ESSAY ON WAR,Nurtur'd by Her the infant Arts appear.
587,ESSAY ON WAR,While sage Experience thus teaches Man
588,ESSAY ON WAR,"The useful and the pleasant Arts of Life,"
589,ESSAY ON WAR,"She in harsh lectures, in the frequent broil,"
590,ESSAY ON WAR,Enjoins her Pupil still to cultivate
591,ESSAY ON WAR,"The fatal, necessary Art of War."
592,ESSAY ON WAR,"The Artizan, who from metallic ores"
593,ESSAY ON WAR,"Forms the sharp implements to dress the glebe,"
594,ESSAY ON WAR,And prune the wild luxuriance of the tree; ...
595,ESSAY ON WAR,"By him is made the sword, the spear, the shaft,"
596,ESSAY ON WAR,By Man worn to defend him against Man.
597,ESSAY ON WAR,Most bless'd the country where kind Nature's face
598,ESSAY ON WAR,In unsophisticated Freedom smiles:
599,ESSAY ON WAR,Happy the tenants of primeval days
600,ESSAY ON WAR,When young society is in it's spring:
601,ESSAY ON WAR,"Where there is room and food for millions more,"
602,ESSAY ON WAR,"Love knows no check, the votaries of Love,"
603,ESSAY ON WAR,"The happy votaries of Wedded Love,"
604,ESSAY ON WAR,"Know not the curse of peopled, polish'd, times:"
605,ESSAY ON WAR,The curse to wish their children may be few.
606,ESSAY ON WAR,Sweet converse binds the cords of social love;
607,ESSAY ON WAR,When the rude noise and gestures that ere while
608,ESSAY ON WAR,Imperfectly express'd the labouring thought;
609,ESSAY ON WAR,By social concourse are improv'd to Speech:
610,ESSAY ON WAR,"Speech, reasoning Man's distinguishing perfection;"
611,ESSAY ON WAR,"Speech, the inestimable vehicle"
612,ESSAY ON WAR,"Of mental light, and intellectual bliss;"
613,ESSAY ON WAR,"Whence the fair fruits of Holy Friendship grow,"
614,ESSAY ON WAR,Presenting to fond Hope's enamour'd sight
615,ESSAY ON WAR,The fairy prospect of perpetual Peace.
616,ESSAY ON WAR,"Advanc'd Society's prudential Laws,"
617,ESSAY ON WAR,"The moral virtues of the enlighten'd mind,"
618,ESSAY ON WAR,"And all the ties of Interest and of Love,"
619,ESSAY ON WAR,"In vain conspire to nurse their favourite Peace,"
620,ESSAY ON WAR,And banish dire Immanity and War.
621,ESSAY ON WAR,"Strong Nature's bent, continual increase,"
622,ESSAY ON WAR,"Still counteracts Humanity's fond wish,"
623,ESSAY ON WAR,"The perpetuity of Peace, and Love;"
624,ESSAY ON WAR,Alas! progressive Increase cannot last.
625,ESSAY ON WAR,Soon mourns the encumber'd land it's human load:
626,ESSAY ON WAR,Too soon arrives the inauspicious hour;
627,ESSAY ON WAR,"The Natal Hour of the unhappy Man,"
628,ESSAY ON WAR,Who all his life goes mourning up and down
629,ESSAY ON WAR,"That there is neither bough, nor mud, nor straw"
630,ESSAY ON WAR,That he may take to make himself a hut;
631,ESSAY ON WAR,"No, not in all his native land a twig"
632,ESSAY ON WAR,"That he may take, nor spot of green grass turf,"
633,ESSAY ON WAR,Where without trespass he may set his foot.
634,ESSAY ON WAR,Now Want and Poverty wage War with Love;
635,ESSAY ON WAR,"And hard the conflict: horrible the thought,"
636,ESSAY ON WAR,"That Love, who boasts of his all-conquering impulse,"
637,ESSAY ON WAR,Should have to mourn abortive energies...
638,ESSAY ON WAR,"But in proportion as Mankind increase,"
639,ESSAY ON WAR,"So evils multiply: till Nature's self,"
640,ESSAY ON WAR,(The native passions of the human mind)
641,ESSAY ON WAR,"Engender War; which thins, and segregates,"
642,ESSAY ON WAR,And rectifies the balance of the world:
643,ESSAY ON WAR,"As thick-sown plants in the vegetable world,"
644,ESSAY ON WAR,With stretching branches wage continual War;
645,ESSAY ON WAR,Each tender bud shrinks from the foreign touch
646,ESSAY ON WAR,With a degree of sensitive perception;
647,ESSAY ON WAR,"Till one deforms, o'er-tops, and kills the other."
648,ESSAY ON WAR,"Like Summer swarms, that quit their native hives,"
649,ESSAY ON WAR,"The offspring of increasing families,"
650,ESSAY ON WAR,"Who find no room beneath their father's roofs,"
651,ESSAY ON WAR,"No patrimony nor employ at home,"
652,ESSAY ON WAR,"Colleagu'd in bands explore the desart wilds,"
653,ESSAY ON WAR,To seek adventures; or to seek their food:
654,ESSAY ON WAR,If chance they meet with rovers (like themselves)
655,ESSAY ON WAR,"Whose home is far away in distant vales,"
656,ESSAY ON WAR,"Behind the mountains, or beyond the lake;"
657,ESSAY ON WAR,Instinctively they war where'er they meet:
658,ESSAY ON WAR,The friendly parley cannot intervene;
659,ESSAY ON WAR,The unknown tongue does but create alarm:
660,ESSAY ON WAR,"With jealous fears, stern looks, and brandish'd arms,"
661,ESSAY ON WAR,They stand aloof: as birds of distant groves
662,ESSAY ON WAR,At the strange note prepare for instant War.
663,ESSAY ON WAR,At first they skirmishing dispute the right
664,ESSAY ON WAR,Of hunting in the unappropriate waste:
665,ESSAY ON WAR,But every onset aggravates their hate;
666,ESSAY ON WAR,"Till each increasing force, whetting their swords,"
667,ESSAY ON WAR,"With purpos'd malice seeking out the foe,"
668,ESSAY ON WAR,"Alternate by reprisal and revenge,"
669,ESSAY ON WAR,"Doubly compensate each discomfiture,"
670,ESSAY ON WAR,"Yet seek not to attack each-other's home,"
671,ESSAY ON WAR,"Where Age, and Infancy, in safety dwell:"
672,ESSAY ON WAR,They war but with freebooters: private Peace
673,ESSAY ON WAR,"And Female Covert, Valour scorns to assail."
674,ESSAY ON WAR,"But when in evil hour some female hand,"
675,ESSAY ON WAR,"Whether by force of Love, or force of Arms,"
676,ESSAY ON WAR,Is led across the desart by the Foe;
677,ESSAY ON WAR,The jealous fury kindles to a flame:
678,ESSAY ON WAR,No longer sacred the domestic hearth:
679,ESSAY ON WAR,"Fire, Death, and Devastation, mark their way,"
680,ESSAY ON WAR,And all the horrid crimes of savage War.
681,ESSAY ON WAR,Now War becomes the business of the State:
682,ESSAY ON WAR,"The most humane, the most pacific men,"
683,ESSAY ON WAR,"Must arm for War, or lose all they hold dear:"
684,ESSAY ON WAR,"The sorrows of the Aged, Infant cries,"
685,ESSAY ON WAR,"And Female Tears, resistlessly prevail:"
686,ESSAY ON WAR,"Can gentlest natures be in love with Peace,"
687,ESSAY ON WAR,"When Love, most tender Love, excites to War?"
688,ESSAY ON WAR,"No.... When some lov'd and honour'd youth distrest'd,"
689,ESSAY ON WAR,"Raising his head amongst his arm'd compeers,"
690,ESSAY ON WAR,"Tells that the well-known honourable Maid,"
691,ESSAY ON WAR,"The Virgin Mistress of his dearest hopes,"
692,ESSAY ON WAR,"Is ravish'd from him, borne by force away;"
693,ESSAY ON WAR,"Though pierc'd with grief, yet nobly he exclaims,"
694,ESSAY ON WAR,'Think not I wish to embroil you in my fate:
695,ESSAY ON WAR,"'For though not one of you espouse my cause,"
696,ESSAY ON WAR,'I singly will attempt the desperate deed.
697,ESSAY ON WAR,"'Farewell: I go to find my Love, or die!'"
698,ESSAY ON WAR,"Silent and motionless the legions stand,"
699,ESSAY ON WAR,By looks examining each-other's heart:
700,ESSAY ON WAR,"But soon a murmur through the ranks proceeds,"
701,ESSAY ON WAR,Swelling as quickly a terrific roar;
702,ESSAY ON WAR,"Like heavy waters breaking from their mounds,"
703,ESSAY ON WAR,"A long, and loud, and inarticulate shout,"
704,ESSAY ON WAR,"While every weapon vibrates in the air,"
705,ESSAY ON WAR,And hisses it's fierce vengeance at the foe.
706,ESSAY ON WAR,The righteous cause admits of no delay;
707,ESSAY ON WAR,No tardy foot impedes the immediate march:
708,ESSAY ON WAR,"The Enemy, not taken by surprise,"
709,ESSAY ON WAR,"Wak'd by the watchful fears of conscious guilt,"
710,ESSAY ON WAR,On their frontiers await the coming foe.
711,ESSAY ON WAR,"Now at the near approach of threatening Death,"
712,ESSAY ON WAR,"Full many a thinking, sighing, aching heart,"
713,ESSAY ON WAR,Indulges secretly the hopeless wish
714,ESSAY ON WAR,"For Life, and Peace.... Alas! it cannot be:"
715,ESSAY ON WAR,To advance is to encounter dreadful danger;
716,ESSAY ON WAR,"But to recede, inevitable death;"
717,ESSAY ON WAR,His own associates would deal the blow:
718,ESSAY ON WAR,"Thus led by Fate, behold upon the plain,"
719,ESSAY ON WAR,"The adverse bands in view, and in advance."
720,ESSAY ON WAR,"Now Fear, Self-pity, and affected Courage,"
721,ESSAY ON WAR,Speak in their hideous shouts with voice scarce human;
722,ESSAY ON WAR,Like that which issues from his hollow throat
723,ESSAY ON WAR,Who sleeping bellows in a frightful dream.
724,ESSAY ON WAR,More near their glaring eye-balls flashing meet;
725,ESSAY ON WAR,"Terror and Rage distorting every face,"
726,ESSAY ON WAR,Inflame each-other into trembling fury.
727,ESSAY ON WAR,"Soft-ey'd Humanity, oh! veil thy sight!"
728,ESSAY ON WAR,Tis not in Rationality to view
729,ESSAY ON WAR,(Even in thought) the dire ensuing scene;
730,ESSAY ON WAR,"For Madness, Madness reigns, and urges men"
731,ESSAY ON WAR,To deeds that Rationality disowns.
732,ESSAY ON WAR,"Now here and there about the horrid Field,"
733,ESSAY ON WAR,"Striding across the dying and the dead,"
734,ESSAY ON WAR,"Stalks up a man by strength superior,"
735,ESSAY ON WAR,"Or skill and prowess in the arduous fight,"
736,ESSAY ON WAR,Preserv'd alive: ... fainting he looks around;
737,ESSAY ON WAR,"Fearing pursuit, nor caring to pursue."
738,ESSAY ON WAR,"The supplicating voice of bitterest moans,"
739,ESSAY ON WAR,"Contortions of excruciating pain,"
740,ESSAY ON WAR,"The shriek of torture and the groan of death,"
741,ESSAY ON WAR,"Surround him; and as Night her mantle spreads,"
742,ESSAY ON WAR,"To veil the horrors of the mourning Field,"
743,ESSAY ON WAR,"With cautious step shaping his devious way,"
744,ESSAY ON WAR,He seeks a covert where to hide and rest:
745,ESSAY ON WAR,At every leaf that rustles in the breeze
746,ESSAY ON WAR,"Starting, he grasps his sword; and every nerve"
747,ESSAY ON WAR,"Is ready strain'd, for combat or for flight."
748,ESSAY ON WAR,"Thus list'ning to ward off approaching foes,"
749,ESSAY ON WAR,"A distant whispering, fighting, murmuring sound"
750,ESSAY ON WAR,"Salutes his ear, and to his throbbing heart"
751,ESSAY ON WAR,Soft tidings tells of tenderness and love.
752,ESSAY ON WAR,For on that fatal day of vengeful ire.
753,ESSAY ON WAR,"At fearful distance following the host,"
754,ESSAY ON WAR,From either country came a female throng;
755,ESSAY ON WAR,And now beneath the covert of the night
756,ESSAY ON WAR,"Advancing, guided by the voice of woe,"
757,ESSAY ON WAR,"Where on the earth the wounded mourners lay,"
758,ESSAY ON WAR,"With trembling steps and fearful whispering voice,"
759,ESSAY ON WAR,"Each seeks, and calls him whom she came to seek:"
760,ESSAY ON WAR,"And many a fugitive, whom force or fear"
761,ESSAY ON WAR,"Had driven from the Field, steals softly back,"
762,ESSAY ON WAR,Anxious to know the fate of some lov'd friend.
763,ESSAY ON WAR,"Mutual fears appal the mingled group,"
764,ESSAY ON WAR,Starting alternate at the unknown tongue:
765,ESSAY ON WAR,They fear a foe in each uncertain form
766,ESSAY ON WAR,That through the gloom imperfectly appears.
767,ESSAY ON WAR,The mournful horrors of the doleful night
768,ESSAY ON WAR,Melt every heart: ... and when the morning's beam
769,ESSAY ON WAR,"Shews the sad scene, and gives an interview,"
770,ESSAY ON WAR,"Resentment, that worst torment of the mind,"
771,ESSAY ON WAR,"Resentment ceases, satiate wrath subsides."
772,ESSAY ON WAR,Woman is present: and so strong the charm
773,ESSAY ON WAR,"Of weeping Woman's fascinating tears,"
774,ESSAY ON WAR,That though surviving Heroes' unwash'd hands
775,ESSAY ON WAR,"Still grasp the falchion of horrid hue,"
776,ESSAY ON WAR,And though their fallen brethren from the ground
777,ESSAY ON WAR,"May seem to call for Vengeance from their hands,"
778,ESSAY ON WAR,The impulse of Revenge is felt no more;
779,ESSAY ON WAR,"No more the strange attire, the foreign tongue"
780,ESSAY ON WAR,Creates alarm: for Nature's-self has writ
781,ESSAY ON WAR,In every face; where every eye can read
782,ESSAY ON WAR,"Repentant Sorrow, and forgiving Love."
783,ESSAY ON WAR,Their mingled tears wash the lamented dead:
784,ESSAY ON WAR,On every wound they pour soft Pity's balm:
785,ESSAY ON WAR,"Ere Sorrow's tears are dried, they feel the spring"
786,ESSAY ON WAR,"Of new-born joys, and each expanding heart"
787,ESSAY ON WAR,Contemplates future scenes of Peace and Love.
788,ESSAY ON WAR,"Long, even as long as room and food abound,"
789,ESSAY ON WAR,They interchange their friendly offices
790,ESSAY ON WAR,For mutual good; reciprocally kind:
791,ESSAY ON WAR,And much they wonder that they e'er were foes.
792,ESSAY ON WAR,Still War's terrific name is kept alive:
793,ESSAY ON WAR,"Tradition, pointing to the rusty arms"
794,ESSAY ON WAR,"That hang on high, informs each list'ning youth"
795,ESSAY ON WAR,How erst in fatal fields their Grandsires fell;
796,ESSAY ON WAR,Childhood attentive hears the tragic tale;
797,ESSAY ON WAR,And learns to shudder at the name of War.
798,ESSAY ON WAR,"GUNPOWDER! let the Soldier's Pean rise,"
799,ESSAY ON WAR,Where e'er thy name or thundering voice is heard:
800,ESSAY ON WAR,"Let him who, fated to the needful trade,"
801,ESSAY ON WAR,"Deals out the adventitious shafts of Death,"
802,ESSAY ON WAR,Rejoice in thee; and hail with loudest shouts
803,ESSAY ON WAR,The auspicious era when deep-searching Art
804,ESSAY ON WAR,From out the hidden things in Nature's store
805,ESSAY ON WAR,"Cull'd thy tremendous powers, and tutor'd Man"
806,ESSAY ON WAR,To chain the unruly element of Fire
807,ESSAY ON WAR,"At his controul, to wait his potent touch:"
808,ESSAY ON WAR,"To urge his missile bolts of sudden Death,"
809,ESSAY ON WAR,And thunder terribly his vengeful wrath.
810,ESSAY ON WAR,Thy mighty engines and gigantic towers
811,ESSAY ON WAR,With frowning aspect awe the trembling World.
812,ESSAY ON WAR,"Destruction, bursting from thy sudden blaze"
813,ESSAY ON WAR,Hath taught the Birds to tremble at the sound;
814,ESSAY ON WAR,"And Man himself, thy terror's boasted lord,"
815,ESSAY ON WAR,"Within the blacken'd hollow of thy tube,"
816,ESSAY ON WAR,Affrighted sees the darksome shades of Death.
817,ESSAY ON WAR,"Not only mourning groves, but human tears,"
818,ESSAY ON WAR,"The weeping Widow's tears, the Orphan's cries,"
819,ESSAY ON WAR,Sadly deplore that e'er thy powers were known.
820,ESSAY ON WAR,"Yet let thy Advent be the Soldier's song,"
821,ESSAY ON WAR,No longer doom'd to grapple with the Foe
822,ESSAY ON WAR,"With Teeth and Nails--When close in view, and in"
823,ESSAY ON WAR,"Each-other's grasp, to grin, and hack, and stab;"
824,ESSAY ON WAR,Then tug his horrid weapon from one breast
825,ESSAY ON WAR,To hide it in another:--with clear hands
826,ESSAY ON WAR,"He now expertly poizing thy bright tube,"
827,ESSAY ON WAR,"At distance kills, unknowing and unknown;"
828,ESSAY ON WAR,"Sees not the wound he gives, nor hears the shriek"
829,ESSAY ON WAR,Of him whose breast he pierces.... GUNPOWDER!
830,ESSAY ON WAR,(O! let Humanity rejoice) how much
831,ESSAY ON WAR,"The Soldier's fearful work is humaniz'd,"
832,ESSAY ON WAR,Since thy momentous birth--stupendous power.
833,ESSAY ON WAR,"In Britain, where the hills and fertile plains,"
834,ESSAY ON WAR,"Like her historic page, are overspread"
835,ESSAY ON WAR,"With vestiges of War, the Shepherd Boy"
836,ESSAY ON WAR,Climbs the green hillock to survey his flock;
837,ESSAY ON WAR,"Then sweetly sleeps upon his favourite hill,"
838,ESSAY ON WAR,Not conscious that his bed's a Warrior's Tomb.
839,ESSAY ON WAR,"The ancient Mansions, deeply moated round,"
840,ESSAY ON WAR,"Where, in the iron Age of Chivalry,"
841,ESSAY ON WAR,Redoubted Barons wag'd their little Wars;
842,ESSAY ON WAR,"The strong Entrenchments and enormous Mounds,"
843,ESSAY ON WAR,"Rais'd to oppose the fierce, perfidious Danes;"
844,ESSAY ON WAR,And still more ancient traces that remain
845,ESSAY ON WAR,"Of Dykes and Camps, from the far distant date"
846,ESSAY ON WAR,"When minstrel Druids wak'd the soul of War,"
847,ESSAY ON WAR,"And rous'd to arms old Albion's hardy sons,"
848,ESSAY ON WAR,To stem the tide of Roman Tyranny: ...
849,ESSAY ON WAR,"War's footsteps, thus imprinted on the ground,"
850,ESSAY ON WAR,"Shew that in Britain he, from age to age,"
851,ESSAY ON WAR,"Has rear'd his horrid head, and raging reign'd."
852,ESSAY ON WAR,Long on the margins of the silver Tweed
853,ESSAY ON WAR,Opposing Ensigns wav'd; War's clarion
854,ESSAY ON WAR,"Dreadfully echo'd down the winding stream,"
855,ESSAY ON WAR,Where now sweet Peace and Unity reside:
856,ESSAY ON WAR,"The happy peasant of Tweed's smiling dale,"
857,ESSAY ON WAR,"Whene'er his spade disturbs a Soldier's bones,"
858,ESSAY ON WAR,With shudd'ring horror ruminates on War;
859,ESSAY ON WAR,"Then deeper hides the awful spectacle,"
860,ESSAY ON WAR,Blessing the peaceful days in which he lives
861,ESSAY ON WAR,"Since Peace has bless'd the villages on Tweed,"
862,ESSAY ON WAR,And War has ceas'd to drive his iron car
863,ESSAY ON WAR,"On Britain's shore, what myriads of men"
864,ESSAY ON WAR,Over the Eastern and the Western Seas
865,ESSAY ON WAR,"Have follow'd War, and found untimely graves."
866,ESSAY ON WAR,Where'er the jarring interests of States
867,ESSAY ON WAR,Excite the brave to' advance their native land
868,ESSAY ON WAR,"By deeds of arms, Britons are foremost found."
869,ESSAY ON WAR,"The sprightly bands, hast'ning from place to place,"
870,ESSAY ON WAR,"Gayly carousing in their gay attire,"
871,ESSAY ON WAR,"Invite, not force the train of heedless youths,"
872,ESSAY ON WAR,Who croud to share their jollity and joy:
873,ESSAY ON WAR,"To martial music dancing into death,"
874,ESSAY ON WAR,They fell their Freedom for a holiday;
875,ESSAY ON WAR,"And with the Rich and Great 'tis Glory charms,"
876,ESSAY ON WAR,And Beauty's favour that rewards the Brave.
877,ESSAY ON WAR,All the historic Records of the World
878,ESSAY ON WAR,Are little more than histories of Wars;
879,ESSAY ON WAR,"Shewing how many thousands War destroy'd,"
880,ESSAY ON WAR,"The time, the place, and some few great ones' names."
881,ESSAY ON WAR,"The mournful remnants of demolished States,"
882,ESSAY ON WAR,"The Greek, the Roman, and long-exil'd Jew;"
883,ESSAY ON WAR,Are living monuments of wasting War's
884,ESSAY ON WAR,Annihilating power: and while they mourn
885,ESSAY ON WAR,"Their Grandeur faded, and their Power extinct,"
886,ESSAY ON WAR,To every State _memento mori_ sounds.
887,ESSAY ON WAR,From age to age the habitable World
888,ESSAY ON WAR,Has been a constant theatre of War:
889,ESSAY ON WAR,"In every land with Nature's gifts most blest,"
890,ESSAY ON WAR,Frequent and fatal Wars destructive rage.
891,ESSAY ON WAR,"So bland is fair Britannia's genial clime,"
892,ESSAY ON WAR,"So liberal her all-protecting Laws,"
893,ESSAY ON WAR,"So generous the spirit of her Sons,"
894,ESSAY ON WAR,"So fond, so chaste, her Daughters virtuous love,"
895,ESSAY ON WAR,"That human offspring still redundant grows,"
896,ESSAY ON WAR,And free-born Britons must contend for life.
897,ESSAY ON WAR,"O! envy not the lands where Slaves reside,"
898,ESSAY ON WAR,"Though their proud Tyrants boast of _peaceful_ reign,"
899,ESSAY ON WAR,"Where hard Oppression, freezing genial love,"
900,ESSAY ON WAR,Performs the work of War in embryo:
901,ESSAY ON WAR,"Let not mistaken fondness doat on Peace,"
902,ESSAY ON WAR,Preserv'd by arts more horrid far than War! ...
903,ESSAY ON WAR,Let the dull languor of the pale Chinese
904,ESSAY ON WAR,"Desert their Infants, and their _Peace_ enjoy!"
905,ESSAY ON WAR,"But, O! let Britons still in Love and War"
906,ESSAY ON WAR,Exert the generous ardour of the soul;
907,ESSAY ON WAR,"Protect the Fair, and foster Infancy."
908,ESSAY ON WAR,"By strenuous enterprize, and arduous toils,"
909,ESSAY ON WAR,Is public safety purchas'd and secur'd.
910,ESSAY ON WAR,"Negative merit, ""I have done no harm,"""
911,ESSAY ON WAR,Is an inglorious boast: shall he who sits
912,ESSAY ON WAR,"Secure, enjoying Plenty in the lap"
913,ESSAY ON WAR,"Of Ease, vaunt his recumbent Virtues? ... He"
914,ESSAY ON WAR,Brand with harsh epithets the Warrior's toils?
915,ESSAY ON WAR,While 'tis to them he owes sincerest thanks
916,ESSAY ON WAR,"For Peace and Safety, that are earn'd in War...."
917,ESSAY ON WAR,"As well might he who eats the flesh of Lambs,"
918,ESSAY ON WAR,"And smacks the ichor in a savoury dish,"
919,ESSAY ON WAR,"Boast his humanity, and say ""My hand"
920,ESSAY ON WAR,"Ne'er slew a Lamb;"" and censure as a crime,"
921,ESSAY ON WAR,"The Butcher's cruel, necessary trade."
922,ESSAY ON WAR,"In Battle, the chance-medley game of Death,"
923,ESSAY ON WAR,"Where every one still hopes 'till he expires,"
924,ESSAY ON WAR,"Less horror shocks the mind contemplative,"
925,ESSAY ON WAR,"Than where, in slow procession's solemn pace,"
926,ESSAY ON WAR,"Doom'd wretches meet their destin'd fate in bonds,"
927,ESSAY ON WAR,"Who know the moment to expect the blow,"
928,ESSAY ON WAR,And count the moments 'till that moment comes:
929,ESSAY ON WAR,"Or where Oppression wages War, in Peace,"
930,ESSAY ON WAR,On the defenceless: on the hapless man
931,ESSAY ON WAR,Who holds his breath but by another's will:
932,ESSAY ON WAR,Whose Life is only one long cruel Death! ...
933,ESSAY ON WAR,"Hardly he fares, and hopelessly he toils;"
934,ESSAY ON WAR,"And when his driver's anger, or caprice,"
935,ESSAY ON WAR,"Or wanton cruelty, inflicts a blow,"
936,ESSAY ON WAR,"Not daring to look angry at the whip,"
937,ESSAY ON WAR,Oh! see him meekly clasp his hands and bow
938,ESSAY ON WAR,To every stroke: no lurid deathful scene
939,ESSAY ON WAR,"In Battle's rage, so racks the feeling heart;"
940,ESSAY ON WAR,"Not all the thunders of infuriate War,"
941,ESSAY ON WAR,"Disploding mines, and crafting, bursting bombs,"
942,ESSAY ON WAR,Are half so horrid as the sounding lash
943,ESSAY ON WAR,That echoes through the Carribean groves.
944,ESSAY ON WAR,"Incessant is the War of Human Wit,"
945,ESSAY ON WAR,Oppos'd to bestial strength; and variously
946,ESSAY ON WAR,"Successful: in these happy fertile climes,"
947,ESSAY ON WAR,Man still maintains his surreptitious power;
948,ESSAY ON WAR,"Reigns o'er the Brutes, and, with the voice of Fate,"
949,ESSAY ON WAR,"Says ""This to-day, and that to-morrow dies."""
950,ESSAY ON WAR,"Though here our Shambles blazon the Renown,"
951,ESSAY ON WAR,"The Victory, and Rule, of lordly Man;"
952,ESSAY ON WAR,Far wider tracts within the Torrid Zone
953,ESSAY ON WAR,Own no such Lord: where Sol's intenser rays
954,ESSAY ON WAR,"Create in bestial hearts more fervid fires,"
955,ESSAY ON WAR,And deadlier poisons arm the Serpent's tooth;
956,ESSAY ON WAR,"In gloomy shades, impassable to Man,"
957,ESSAY ON WAR,"Where matted foliage exclude the Sun,"
958,ESSAY ON WAR,The torpid Birds that crawl from bough to bough
959,ESSAY ON WAR,Utter their notes of terror: while beneath
960,ESSAY ON WAR,"Fury and Venom, couch'd in murky dens,"
961,ESSAY ON WAR,"Hissing and yelling, guard the hideous gloom."
962,ESSAY ON WAR,"O'er dreary wastes, untrod by human feet,"
963,ESSAY ON WAR,Without controul the lordly Lion reigns;
964,ESSAY ON WAR,And every creature trembles at his voice:
965,ESSAY ON WAR,"When risen from his den, he prances forth,"
966,ESSAY ON WAR,"Extends his talons, shakes his flaky mane,"
967,ESSAY ON WAR,"Then whurrs his tufted tail, and stooping low"
968,ESSAY ON WAR,"His wide mouth near the ground, his dreadful roar"
969,ESSAY ON WAR,Makes all the desart tremble: he proclaims
970,ESSAY ON WAR,His ire--proclaims his strong necessity;
971,ESSAY ON WAR,And that surprise or artifice he scorns.
972,ESSAY ON WAR,"Unskill'd, alas! in philosophic lore,"
973,ESSAY ON WAR,Unbless'd with scientific erudition;
974,ESSAY ON WAR,"How can I sing of elemental War,"
975,ESSAY ON WAR,Or the contending powers of opposite
976,ESSAY ON WAR,"Attractions, that impel, and poize, and guide,"
977,ESSAY ON WAR,"The ever-rolling Spheres: Animal War,"
978,ESSAY ON WAR,"The flux of Life, devouring and devour'd,"
979,ESSAY ON WAR,"Ceaseless in every tribe, through Earth, and Air,"
980,ESSAY ON WAR,"And Ocean, transcends my utmost ken."
981,ESSAY ON WAR,
982,ESSAY ON WAR,From obvious truths my Song has aim'd to shew
983,ESSAY ON WAR,That War is an inevitable Ill;
984,ESSAY ON WAR,An Ill through Nature's various Realms diffus'd;
985,ESSAY ON WAR,An Ill subservient to the General Good.
986,ESSAY ON WAR,With sympathetic sense of human woes
987,ESSAY ON WAR,"Deeply impress'd, the melancholy Muse"
988,ESSAY ON WAR,With modesty asserts this mournful Truth:
989,ESSAY ON WAR,"'Tis not in human wisdom to avert,"
990,ESSAY ON WAR,"Though every feeling heart must sure lament,"
991,ESSAY ON WAR,The SAD NECESSITY of FATAL WAR.
