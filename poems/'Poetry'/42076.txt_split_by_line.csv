237,A SONG OF THE SEA,
238,A SONG OF THE SEA,
239,A SONG OF THE SEA,The mystic sea is singing its golden song to me;
240,A SONG OF THE SEA,I bend to catch its murmur in silent ecstasy;
241,A SONG OF THE SEA,"Till, as the music ringeth in sweet and solemn tone,"
242,A SONG OF THE SEA,An answering echo waketh a music all mine own!
243,A SONG OF THE SEA,
244,A SONG OF THE SEA,"The sea sings softly, softly upon my listening ear,"
245,A SONG OF THE SEA,And still its notes fall ever in cadence full and clear.
246,A SONG OF THE SEA,The song that waxeth stronger within my beating heart
247,A SONG OF THE SEA,Seems but a second measure--seems of the sea a part!
248,A SONG OF THE SEA,
249,A SONG OF THE SEA,"And far from all the burdens that day brings in its train,"
250,A SONG OF THE SEA,My soul hath found Elysium--renews its youth again!
251,A SONG OF THE SEA,"I hear the golden billows beat on the rock-bound shore,"
252,A SONG OF THE SEA,And still my heart is singing that sweet song o'er and o'er!
253,A SONG OF THE SEA,
254,A SONG OF THE SEA,"O happy Youth, how quickly the sands of life have run!"
255,A SONG OF THE SEA,The shades of eve are falling ere yet the day is done!
256,A SONG OF THE SEA,"The golden sea eternal beats loud and strong and free,"
257,A SONG OF THE SEA,And bears upon its bosom a joy eternally!

265,THE SPIRIT OF THE WATER,'Tis the Spirit of the Water! it breathes upon the sea;
266,THE SPIRIT OF THE WATER,As phantom in its motions it glides mysteriously!
267,THE SPIRIT OF THE WATER,"I see the snow-clad islands that deck the opal bay,"
268,THE SPIRIT OF THE WATER,And the Spirit of the Water now robed in mist and spray.
269,THE SPIRIT OF THE WATER,"The charm that clings eternal to ocean fills my soul,"
270,THE SPIRIT OF THE WATER,As mist-wreathed waves in grandeur pass on unto their goal!
271,THE SPIRIT OF THE WATER,"Ye phantoms on Life's ocean! how like the mist ye seem,"
272,THE SPIRIT OF THE WATER,As backward turneth memory across Life's glow and gleam!
273,THE SPIRIT OF THE WATER,"For ye figure forth Life's pleasures, its cares, its tears and pain,"
274,THE SPIRIT OF THE WATER,And recall with all their glamour Youth's joyous dreams again!
275,THE SPIRIT OF THE WATER,"While still the fateful presence glides on across the wave,"
276,THE SPIRIT OF THE WATER,Nor lifts its veil of mystery until we reach the grave!
277,THE SPIRIT OF THE WATER,"O speak! is it endeavor, or is it blighted faith?"
278,THE SPIRIT OF THE WATER,Or is it but the passing of pain--this silent wraith?
279,THE SPIRIT OF THE WATER,"We know not, oh, we know not here, for o'er Life's restless sea"
280,THE SPIRIT OF THE WATER,"We too glide on, as phantoms all, this side Eternity!"

292,WITH THE TIDE,
293,WITH THE TIDE,Calm seas beneath whose hidden deep
294,WITH THE TIDE,"Are wonders far beyond my ken,"
295,WITH THE TIDE,"There, rocked in murmuring currents, sleep"
296,WITH THE TIDE,The secrets not revealed to men!
297,WITH THE TIDE,
298,WITH THE TIDE,"Peace, like a white-winged dove descends"
299,WITH THE TIDE,"And hovers o'er the waters bright,"

301,WITH THE TIDE,With tones of the approaching night.
302,WITH THE TIDE,
303,WITH THE TIDE,"My glad soul bids thee welcome, and"
304,WITH THE TIDE,Goes forth upon the ocean's tide!
305,WITH THE TIDE,"Far from the care that fills the land,"
306,WITH THE TIDE,To where my spirit would abide!
307,WITH THE TIDE,
308,WITH THE TIDE,"Till, as the cares of day depart"
309,WITH THE TIDE,"And the glad sea its greeting calls,"
310,WITH THE TIDE,"I rise unshackled, strong of heart,"
311,WITH THE TIDE,And from my life the burden falls!
312,WITH THE TIDE,
313,WITH THE TIDE,Thus in this quiet nook I find
314,WITH THE TIDE,All that I longed and sought in vain
315,WITH THE TIDE,"In the world's haunts, my soul to bind,"
316,WITH THE TIDE,"And, seeking, found but grief and pain."
317,WITH THE TIDE,
318,WITH THE TIDE,"Now, like a blessing falls thy grace,"
319,WITH THE TIDE,"O grand, beloved, glorious sea!"
320,WITH THE TIDE,"Drawn by thy message, face to face,"

330,GRAND MANAN,
331,GRAND MANAN,O solemn cliffs of Grand Manan!
332,GRAND MANAN,"In silent might ye rise,"
333,GRAND MANAN,As bounded by th' eternal sea
334,GRAND MANAN,And by the azure skies!
335,GRAND MANAN,
336,GRAND MANAN,"Like a proud soul that stands apart,"
337,GRAND MANAN,"Unknown, unloved, unsought,"
338,GRAND MANAN,Ye guard your stronghold silently
339,GRAND MANAN,Through many battles fought.
340,GRAND MANAN,
341,GRAND MANAN,"The sea-gull sweeps across your wall,"
342,GRAND MANAN,And seaward shapes his course!
343,GRAND MANAN,While at your feet the waves beat loud
344,GRAND MANAN,In measure wild and hoarse.
345,GRAND MANAN,
346,GRAND MANAN,O solemn heights! O grand and calm!
347,GRAND MANAN,Ye hold my heart in thrall!
348,GRAND MANAN,And not a sound is heard beyond
349,GRAND MANAN,The ocean's rise and fall.
350,GRAND MANAN,
351,GRAND MANAN,But as the waves beat strong and loud
352,GRAND MANAN,"Upon your rugged shore,"
353,GRAND MANAN,Through it the sea's sad monotone
354,GRAND MANAN,I hear forevermore!
355,GRAND MANAN,
356,GRAND MANAN,"The sunset glow hath kissed your heights,"
357,GRAND MANAN,As loth to leave you yet;
358,GRAND MANAN,"And, bathed in glories red and gold,"
359,GRAND MANAN,The eve and you have met.
360,GRAND MANAN,
361,GRAND MANAN,"The boat speeds on--we may not stay,"

374,LEEWARD,For the life that hath no bound to its path but the open sea;

376,LEEWARD,"For power to cast aside these fetters dark and strong,"
377,LEEWARD,To bound over heaving deep--and no more to feel the thong
378,LEEWARD,"That cuts through the quivering heart and the restless soul, as well!"
379,LEEWARD,"I yearn for a fuller life, with a might I cannot quell!"
380,LEEWARD,"O for the bounding wave, and the salt, salt spray on my face!"
381,LEEWARD,For the strength to grasp and hold the plan of a waning race.
382,LEEWARD,"For might to compel the tide in its turn to serve my will,"

396,A SONG IN THE EVENING,O sweetest bird that ever sang
397,A SONG IN THE EVENING,In notes of wild rejoicing;
398,A SONG IN THE EVENING,"Thine even-song as first it rang,"
399,A SONG IN THE EVENING,Was thrilling in its voicing!
400,A SONG IN THE EVENING,
401,A SONG IN THE EVENING,I felt thy rapture as I heard
402,A SONG IN THE EVENING,Thy song in all its beauty;
403,A SONG IN THE EVENING,To me it scarce seemed but a bird;
404,A SONG IN THE EVENING,"'Twas life, and love, and duty!"
405,A SONG IN THE EVENING,
406,A SONG IN THE EVENING,"I could not see thy tiny form,"
407,A SONG IN THE EVENING,As softly closed the gloaming;
408,A SONG IN THE EVENING,And like a wanderer in the storm
409,A SONG IN THE EVENING,My heart was blindly roaming.
410,A SONG IN THE EVENING,
411,A SONG IN THE EVENING,"While, as thy song rang pure and clear"
412,A SONG IN THE EVENING,"O'er sweet smell of the haying,"
413,A SONG IN THE EVENING,"Mem'ry sped back through many a year,"
414,A SONG IN THE EVENING,Both light and shade displaying.
415,A SONG IN THE EVENING,
416,A SONG IN THE EVENING,And still thy notes of reed-like tone
417,A SONG IN THE EVENING,"Came clear o'er mead and river,"
418,A SONG IN THE EVENING,"With tender meaning all its own,"
419,A SONG IN THE EVENING,And trilled and trilled forever!
420,A SONG IN THE EVENING,
421,A SONG IN THE EVENING,"""O heart,"" it sang, ""let thine own life"
422,A SONG IN THE EVENING,"Become a song to others,"
423,A SONG IN THE EVENING,That thou mayst count them in the strife
424,A SONG IN THE EVENING,"Not alien, but as brothers!"
425,A SONG IN THE EVENING,
426,A SONG IN THE EVENING,"Sing on, sing on, thy notes repeat,"
427,A SONG IN THE EVENING,"Sing life, and love, and duty,"
428,A SONG IN THE EVENING,That mystic three whose names replete
429,A SONG IN THE EVENING,Are e'er with heavenly beauty.
430,A SONG IN THE EVENING,

524,THE IRIS,Of joy and spring-time born.
525,THE IRIS,
526,THE IRIS,"They march demurely, side by side,"
527,THE IRIS,How many pair there be!
528,THE IRIS,"Far as mine eye can reach, their forms"
529,THE IRIS,In green and white I see.
530,THE IRIS,
531,THE IRIS,Each sister wears with youthful grace
532,THE IRIS,"Her snowy Norman cap,"

1001,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,
1002,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,"As he mused in hours of leisure,"
1003,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,Came into his brain this thought:

1016,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,
1017,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,So he sent his message speeding
1018,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,"To the regions far and near,"
1019,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,That some great and cunning builder

1028,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,Went forth proudly unto war;
1029,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,"Days and months sped on unheeded,"
1030,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,Still no word came from afar.
1031,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,
1032,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,"Yet the architect wrought, silent,"
1033,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,Though he touched nor plan nor pen;
1034,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,For the palace he was building
1035,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,Was not seen by eyes of men.

1037,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,While unto the poor and wretched

1046,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,

1061,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,

1065,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,"Him to torture, death and shame!"
1066,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,
1067,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,"But, as in his rage he pondered,"
1068,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,"Sleep o'ertook him, held him chained,"
1069,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,And a vision hovered near him--
1070,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,Earthly sense grew dim and waned.
1071,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,
1072,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,Then the spirit of his brother
1073,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,Swiftly to his side drew nigh;
1074,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,"Said, in words that thrilled his being,"
1075,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,"""He whom thou hast doomed to die"

1083,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,"Reared in all its beauty there,"

1085,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,And of ornament most fair.
1086,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,
1087,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,"""Fashioned of the precious metals"

1091,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,
1092,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,"Thus, in Paradise there standeth"

1100,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,Bowed in prayer his aged head.

1102,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,Gondoforus knelt before him;
1103,THE MANSION THAT ENDURED,"Then the holy Thomas spoke,"

1117,THE CHIMES,
1118,THE CHIMES,"On fair Lake Como's sunny brink,"
1119,THE CHIMES,An ancient monastery stood
1120,THE CHIMES,"Close to the mountain's steep ascent,"
1121,THE CHIMES,As nestling 'neath its snowy hood.
1122,THE CHIMES,And there a pale young artisan
1123,THE CHIMES,His cunning plied; a wondrous chime
1124,THE CHIMES,"He sought to frame, that those who loved"
1125,THE CHIMES,The beauty of that molten rhyme
1126,THE CHIMES,Within the valley's breadth should hear
1127,THE CHIMES,Pealing at morn and even clear.
1128,THE CHIMES,
1129,THE CHIMES,"For years he toiled, content if he"
1130,THE CHIMES,At last might frame a chime so sweet
1131,THE CHIMES,That pilgrims oft would silent pause
1132,THE CHIMES,To hear the music glad repeat.
1133,THE CHIMES,Borne o'er the tranquil waters' reach
1134,THE CHIMES,And bringing swift unto the heart
1135,THE CHIMES,
1136,THE CHIMES,"Its tones of warning, praise, and love,"
1137,THE CHIMES,That nevermore should then depart.
1138,THE CHIMES,"Such was the thought he wove, and prayed"
1139,THE CHIMES,That his life's work be holy made.
1140,THE CHIMES,
1141,THE CHIMES,The day came when that perfect chime
1142,THE CHIMES,"Was placed aloft, its song to wing"
1143,THE CHIMES,Forth o'er the waters' silent reach
1144,THE CHIMES,And to the convent's roof to bring
1145,THE CHIMES,The lost and wayworn traveller from
1146,THE CHIMES,"The busy haunts of world and strife,"
1147,THE CHIMES,"Back, where the calm of prayer might prove"
1148,THE CHIMES,The guide-post to Eternal life!
1149,THE CHIMES,Then was the artisan as one
1150,THE CHIMES,"Whose dearest life-work, here, was done."
1151,THE CHIMES,
1152,THE CHIMES,"Not so, howe'er! 'Twas yet to be"
1153,THE CHIMES,A lifelong task--a path to lead
1154,THE CHIMES,"Through many a land, in futile search"
1155,THE CHIMES,O'er stony ways where feet should bleed.
1156,THE CHIMES,Not yet his soul's high guerdon find--
1157,THE CHIMES,The prize his hands had placed aloft.
1158,THE CHIMES,How rarely here on earth we see
1159,THE CHIMES,Life's morning fill its promise soft.
1160,THE CHIMES,Not yet was he to find his rest
1161,THE CHIMES,Beside Lake Como's lovely breast.
1162,THE CHIMES,
1163,THE CHIMES,A savage horde o'erran the land
1164,THE CHIMES,And bore away the prizéd chime;
1165,THE CHIMES,"Afar from peaceful Como's side,"
1166,THE CHIMES,To some unknown and distant clime.
1167,THE CHIMES,In vain the artisan complained
1168,THE CHIMES,Beneath a fate unkind; he drew
1169,THE CHIMES,"No comfort from lament or prayer,"
1170,THE CHIMES,For peace no more his hearthstone knew.
1171,THE CHIMES,"Then, as one day he brooding mused"
1172,THE CHIMES,"And consolation sweet refused,"
1173,THE CHIMES,
1174,THE CHIMES,He seemed to see before his eyes
1175,THE CHIMES,"A land outspread, wherein his feet"
1176,THE CHIMES,"Should wander, seeking ever there"
1177,THE CHIMES,"His loved and lost--his chime so sweet,"
1178,THE CHIMES,He rose at once; he sought no aid;
1179,THE CHIMES,But bowed his head in silent prayer;
1180,THE CHIMES,Then from his home he straightway passed
1181,THE CHIMES,That no one might his purpose share.
1182,THE CHIMES,And leaving home and rest that day
1183,THE CHIMES,With breaking heart went on his way.
1184,THE CHIMES,
1185,THE CHIMES,"Whene'er he heard, in foreign land,"
1186,THE CHIMES,Some wondrous story of a chime
1187,THE CHIMES,"Whose tones were liquid notes of song,"
1188,THE CHIMES,"Whose bells rang out a gladsome rhyme,"
1189,THE CHIMES,"He journeyed to that storied place,"
1190,THE CHIMES,"Nor paused till he should reach the spot,--"
1191,THE CHIMES,"Only to find his quest in vain,"
1192,THE CHIMES,While yet those bells were ne'er forgot.
1193,THE CHIMES,Each day his soul went up in prayer
1194,THE CHIMES,That those clear chimes might pierce the air!
1195,THE CHIMES,
1196,THE CHIMES,Thus journeyed he for many a year
1197,THE CHIMES,While locks of gold had turned to grey
1198,THE CHIMES,Till in a distant land he strayed
1199,THE CHIMES,And heard at close of summer day
1200,THE CHIMES,The old sweet song rung by his chime
1201,THE CHIMES,He long had listened for in vain!
1202,THE CHIMES,"Quickly rose tears in lifted eyes,"
1203,THE CHIMES,Quickly his heart renounced its pain!
1204,THE CHIMES,"""O loved and lost! for many a day"
1205,THE CHIMES,"You've called me from my youth away!"""
1206,THE CHIMES,
1207,THE CHIMES,For now on foreign strand he waits
1208,THE CHIMES,"Alone in age--alone in kin,"
1209,THE CHIMES,Listening as listens one who bides
1210,THE CHIMES,"Outside of Heaven, to praise within."
1211,THE CHIMES,Not vain his search! not lost his love!
1212,THE CHIMES,He feels once more the old-time throb
1213,THE CHIMES,Ere cruel foes his prize had ta'en;
1214,THE CHIMES,No more may they his treasure rob!
1215,THE CHIMES,His life went forth in one glad cry
1216,THE CHIMES,"Beneath that far-off, alien sky!"
1217,THE CHIMES,
1218,THE CHIMES,'Twas ended--all the tender search;
1219,THE CHIMES,The hours of pain and sleepless toil;
1220,THE CHIMES,"There, where no loved his hand might clasp;"
1221,THE CHIMES,"There, on that wild and foreign soil."
1222,THE CHIMES,But deep within his heart was writ
1223,THE CHIMES,His purpose pure; his steadfast search.
1224,THE CHIMES,"And lo! his chime still calls to prayer,"
1225,THE CHIMES,And still peals forth from ivied church.
1226,THE CHIMES,The bells once blessed by saintly hands
1227,THE CHIMES,"Now call, in Limerick, God's commands!"
1228,THE CHIMES,
1229,THE CHIMES,My story's done--what need to say
1230,THE CHIMES,He sleeps as well and sweetly there
1231,THE CHIMES,Beneath that arch of foreign sky
1232,THE CHIMES,As in his native land so fair.
1233,THE CHIMES,"He found, ere death had met his feet"
1234,THE CHIMES,"The prize he sought with spirit brave,"
1235,THE CHIMES,And finding was content to lie
1236,THE CHIMES,Afar from Como in his grave.
1237,THE CHIMES,Love was the goal that led his feet
1238,THE CHIMES,To peace and deathless calm replete.
1239,THE CHIMES,
1240,THE CHIMES,"The chimes? Ah, well, perhaps they peal"
1241,THE CHIMES,No less the sweetly that their note
1242,THE CHIMES,In alien lands the tidings bring;
1243,THE CHIMES,"They still to God their praise devote,"
1244,THE CHIMES,And though their maker no more hears
1245,THE CHIMES,"The liquid music of each tone,"
1246,THE CHIMES,They speak to those whose living needs
1247,THE CHIMES,Make of the chimes their very own.
1248,THE CHIMES,"Though hand that made is turned to clay,"
1249,THE CHIMES,His work--the chimes--lives on alway!

1287,FRANCIS COSTER'S STORY,"And this duty then completed,"
1288,FRANCIS COSTER'S STORY,To the little chapel door
1289,FRANCIS COSTER'S STORY,"Turned their feet, and, entering, vanished"

1429,A DREAM,In joyous measure sang me forth their tale

1431,A DREAM,Upon mine eyes that straightway turned me pale!
1432,A DREAM,"I looked and wondered, and I grew as chill"

1434,A DREAM,"As far beyond that living, green-clad hill,"

1446,A DREAM,I knew that naught of earth was left save me
1447,A DREAM,To look upon that strange and glorious sea!
1448,A DREAM,"And, as I gazed, wild flames leapt up to seize"

1457,A DREAM,And ever seek to gain what lies afar
1458,A DREAM,"Above them! ""Souls of just men perfect made,"""
1459,A DREAM,"""Yield not,"" I cried, ""for here a mortal stands"
1460,A DREAM,"""Alone and helpless in these alien lands;"

1479,ON EMPYREAN HEIGHTS,"While Peace, remote, shone in her beauty fair."
1480,ON EMPYREAN HEIGHTS,I heard the clash of arms; the martial tread;
1481,ON EMPYREAN HEIGHTS,While nation warred with nation in their lust
1482,ON EMPYREAN HEIGHTS,"Of pride and power, until there lay the dead--"
1483,ON EMPYREAN HEIGHTS,The heroes of a decade--in the dust!
1484,ON EMPYREAN HEIGHTS,
1485,ON EMPYREAN HEIGHTS,"I saw, in ranks that spread to either pole,"
1486,ON EMPYREAN HEIGHTS,Heroic deeds of great men and of true;
1487,ON EMPYREAN HEIGHTS,The highest aspirations of the soul;
1488,ON EMPYREAN HEIGHTS,"The work wrought, through the many, by the few!"
1489,ON EMPYREAN HEIGHTS,I sped from rising sun unto the west;
1490,ON EMPYREAN HEIGHTS,I read the stars that mirrored in the sky;
1491,ON EMPYREAN HEIGHTS,"And some in a resplendent light were dressed,"
1492,ON EMPYREAN HEIGHTS,And some through shadow I could scarce descry.
1493,ON EMPYREAN HEIGHTS,
1494,ON EMPYREAN HEIGHTS,I saw a Nation's rise and saw its fall;

1511,ON EMPYREAN HEIGHTS,

1514,ON EMPYREAN HEIGHTS,"That greed of gain--that selfish, restless will"
1515,ON EMPYREAN HEIGHTS,Was crushing out the tender youth's sweet smile.
1516,ON EMPYREAN HEIGHTS,I also read of good and saw its scope
1517,ON EMPYREAN HEIGHTS,Of radiance on a troubled world's dark web;
1518,ON EMPYREAN HEIGHTS,And saw that trust and love and buoyant hope
1519,ON EMPYREAN HEIGHTS,Outrode the spring-time tide ere it could ebb.
1520,ON EMPYREAN HEIGHTS,

1825,THE MARTINS,"Martins! How your note reminds me of the days so long ago,"

1829,THE MARTINS,And I seem to see the village--and the spell of yore is cast
1830,THE MARTINS,Once again about my spirit! Memory brings before my view
1831,THE MARTINS,Friends and faces long since vanished--sounds and scenes that
1832,THE MARTINS,once I knew.
1833,THE MARTINS,
1834,THE MARTINS,"Till the sea-girt town uprises from the mist, in verdure drest,"

1837,THE MARTINS,"And the martins wheel and circle, now, with swift wing through the air."
1838,THE MARTINS,
1839,THE MARTINS,"So I muse while twilight summons once again the long ago,"
1840,THE MARTINS,"And its clustered memories fill my brooding heart, and overflow."
1841,THE MARTINS,"Youth and love, and hope, aweary in these years have grown and I"
1842,THE MARTINS,Walk afaint in life's rough pathway where erstwhile my feet did fly.
1843,THE MARTINS,
1844,THE MARTINS,But I think when Azrael greets me I would fain the hour were mine
1845,THE MARTINS,'Twixt the sunset and the even--at the summer day's decline.
