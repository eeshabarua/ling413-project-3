23,WAR IS KIND,
24,WAR IS KIND,"Do not weep, maiden, for war is kind."
25,WAR IS KIND,Because your lover threw wild hands toward the sky
26,WAR IS KIND,"And the affrighted steed ran on alone,"
27,WAR IS KIND,Do not weep.
28,WAR IS KIND,War is kind.
29,WAR IS KIND,
30,WAR IS KIND,"Hoarse, booming drums of the"
31,WAR IS KIND,"regiment,"
32,WAR IS KIND,"Little souls who thirst for fight,"
33,WAR IS KIND,These men were born to drill and die.
34,WAR IS KIND,The unexplained glory files above
35,WAR IS KIND,"them,"
36,WAR IS KIND,"Great is the battle-god, great, and his"
37,WAR IS KIND,kingdom--
38,WAR IS KIND,A field where a thousand corpses lie.
39,WAR IS KIND,
40,WAR IS KIND,"Do not weep, babe, for war is kind."
41,WAR IS KIND,Because your father tumbled in the yellow
42,WAR IS KIND,"trenches,"
43,WAR IS KIND,"Raged at his breast, gulped and died,"
44,WAR IS KIND,Do not weep.
45,WAR IS KIND,War is kind.
46,WAR IS KIND,
47,WAR IS KIND,"Swift blazing flag of the regiment,"
48,WAR IS KIND,"Eagle with crest of red and gold,"
49,WAR IS KIND,These men were born to drill and die.
50,WAR IS KIND,"Point for them the virtue of the slaughter,"
51,WAR IS KIND,Make plain to them the excellence of killing
52,WAR IS KIND,And a field where a thousand corpses
53,WAR IS KIND,lie.
54,WAR IS KIND,
55,WAR IS KIND,Mother whose heart hung humble as a button
56,WAR IS KIND,"On the bright splendid shroud of your son,"
57,WAR IS KIND,Do not weep.
58,WAR IS KIND,War is kind.

63,WAR IS KIND,"What says the sea, little shell?"
64,WAR IS KIND,"""What says the sea?"
65,WAR IS KIND,"""Long has our brother been silent to us,"
66,WAR IS KIND,"""Kept his message for the ships,"
67,WAR IS KIND,"""Awkward ships, stupid ships."""
68,WAR IS KIND,
69,WAR IS KIND,"""The sea bids you mourn, O Pines,"
70,WAR IS KIND,"""Sing low in the moonlight."
71,WAR IS KIND,"""He sends tale of the land of doom,"
72,WAR IS KIND,"""Of place where endless falls"
73,WAR IS KIND,"""A rain of women's tears,"
74,WAR IS KIND,"""And men in grey robes--"
75,WAR IS KIND,"""Men in grey robes--"
76,WAR IS KIND,"""Chant the unknown pain."""
77,WAR IS KIND,

103,WAR IS KIND,
104,WAR IS KIND,
105,WAR IS KIND,
106,WAR IS KIND,To the maiden
107,WAR IS KIND,"The sea was blue meadow,"
108,WAR IS KIND,Alive with little froth-people
109,WAR IS KIND,Singing.
110,WAR IS KIND,
111,WAR IS KIND,"To the sailor, wrecked,"
112,WAR IS KIND,The sea was dead grey walls
113,WAR IS KIND,"Superlative in vacancy,"
114,WAR IS KIND,Upon which nevertheless at fateful time
115,WAR IS KIND,Was written
116,WAR IS KIND,The grim hatred of nature.
117,WAR IS KIND,
118,WAR IS KIND,
119,WAR IS KIND,
120,WAR IS KIND,
121,WAR IS KIND,A little ink more or less!
122,WAR IS KIND,It surely can't matter?
123,WAR IS KIND,"Even the sky and the opulent sea,"
124,WAR IS KIND,"The plains and the hills, aloof,"
125,WAR IS KIND,Hear the uproar of all these books.
126,WAR IS KIND,But it is only a little ink more or less.
127,WAR IS KIND,
128,WAR IS KIND,What?
129,WAR IS KIND,You define me God with these trinkets?
130,WAR IS KIND,Can my misery meal on an ordered walking
131,WAR IS KIND,Of surpliced numskulls?
132,WAR IS KIND,And a fanfare of lights?
133,WAR IS KIND,Or even upon the measured pulpitings
134,WAR IS KIND,Of the familiar false and true?
135,WAR IS KIND,Is this God?
136,WAR IS KIND,"Where, then is hell?"
137,WAR IS KIND,Show me some bastard mushrooms
138,WAR IS KIND,Sprung from a pollution of blood.
139,WAR IS KIND,It is better.
140,WAR IS KIND,
141,WAR IS KIND,Where is God?
142,WAR IS KIND,
143,WAR IS KIND,
144,WAR IS KIND,
145,WAR IS KIND,
146,WAR IS KIND,"""Have you ever made a just man?"""
147,WAR IS KIND,"""Oh, I have made three,"" answered"
148,WAR IS KIND,"God,"
149,WAR IS KIND,"""But two of them are dead,"
150,WAR IS KIND,"""And the third--"
151,WAR IS KIND,"""Listen! Listen!"
152,WAR IS KIND,"""And you will hear the thud of his defeat."""
153,WAR IS KIND,
154,WAR IS KIND,
155,WAR IS KIND,
156,WAR IS KIND,
157,WAR IS KIND,I explain the silvered passing of a ship
158,WAR IS KIND,"at night,"
159,WAR IS KIND,"The sweep of each sad lost wave,"
160,WAR IS KIND,"The dwindling boom of the steel thing's striving,"
161,WAR IS KIND,"The little cry of a man to a man,"
162,WAR IS KIND,"A shadow falling across the greyer night,"
163,WAR IS KIND,And the sinking of the small star;
164,WAR IS KIND,
165,WAR IS KIND,"Then the waste, the far waste of waters,"
166,WAR IS KIND,And the soft lashing of black waves
167,WAR IS KIND,For long and in loneliness.
168,WAR IS KIND,
169,WAR IS KIND,"Remember, thou, O ship of love,"
170,WAR IS KIND,"Thou leavest a far waste of waters,"
171,WAR IS KIND,And the soft lashing of black waves
172,WAR IS KIND,For long and in loneliness.
173,WAR IS KIND,
174,WAR IS KIND,
175,WAR IS KIND,
176,WAR IS KIND,
177,WAR IS KIND,"""I have heard the sunset song of the"
178,WAR IS KIND,"birches,"
179,WAR IS KIND,"""A white melody in the silence,"
180,WAR IS KIND,"""I have seen a quarrel of the pines."
181,WAR IS KIND,"""At nightfall"
182,WAR IS KIND,"""The little grasses have rushed by me"
183,WAR IS KIND,"""With the wind men."
184,WAR IS KIND,"""These things have I lived,"" quoth the"
185,WAR IS KIND,"maniac,"
186,WAR IS KIND,"""Possessing only eyes and ears."
187,WAR IS KIND,"""But you--"
188,WAR IS KIND,"""You don green spectacles before you look at roses."""
189,WAR IS KIND,
190,WAR IS KIND,
191,WAR IS KIND,
192,WAR IS KIND,
193,WAR IS KIND,Fast rode the knight
194,WAR IS KIND,"With spurs, hot and reeking,"
195,WAR IS KIND,"Ever waving an eager sword,"
196,WAR IS KIND,"""To save my lady!"""
197,WAR IS KIND,"Fast rode the knight,"
198,WAR IS KIND,And leaped from saddle to war.
199,WAR IS KIND,Men of steel flickered and gleamed
200,WAR IS KIND,"Like riot of silver lights,"
201,WAR IS KIND,And the gold of the knight's good banner
202,WAR IS KIND,Still waved on a castle wall.
203,WAR IS KIND,.    .    .    .    .    .    .
204,WAR IS KIND,"A horse,"
205,WAR IS KIND,"Blowing, staggering, bloody thing,"
206,WAR IS KIND,Forgotten at foot of castle wall.
207,WAR IS KIND,A horse
208,WAR IS KIND,Dead at foot of castle wall.
209,WAR IS KIND,
210,WAR IS KIND,
211,WAR IS KIND,
212,WAR IS KIND,
213,WAR IS KIND,Forth went the candid man
214,WAR IS KIND,And spoke freely to the wind--
215,WAR IS KIND,When he looked about him he was in a far
216,WAR IS KIND,strange country.
217,WAR IS KIND,
218,WAR IS KIND,Forth went the candid man
219,WAR IS KIND,And spoke freely to the stars--
220,WAR IS KIND,Yellow light tore sight from his eye.
221,WAR IS KIND,
222,WAR IS KIND,"""My good fool,"" said a learned bystander,"
223,WAR IS KIND,"""Your operations are mad."""
224,WAR IS KIND,
225,WAR IS KIND,"""You are too candid,"" cried the candid man."
226,WAR IS KIND,And when his stick left the head of the
227,WAR IS KIND,learned bystander
228,WAR IS KIND,It was two sticks.
229,WAR IS KIND,
230,WAR IS KIND,
231,WAR IS KIND,
232,WAR IS KIND,
233,WAR IS KIND,You tell me this is God?
234,WAR IS KIND,"I tell you this is a printed list,"
235,WAR IS KIND,A burning candle and an ass.
236,WAR IS KIND,
237,WAR IS KIND,
238,WAR IS KIND,
239,WAR IS KIND,
240,WAR IS KIND,On the desert
241,WAR IS KIND,A silence from the moon's deepest
242,WAR IS KIND,valley.
243,WAR IS KIND,Fire rays fall athwart the robes
244,WAR IS KIND,"Of hooded men, squat and dumb."
245,WAR IS KIND,"Before them, a woman"
246,WAR IS KIND,Moves to the blowing of shrill whistles
247,WAR IS KIND,"And distant thunder of drums,"
248,WAR IS KIND,"While mystic things, sinuous, dull with"
249,WAR IS KIND,"terrible color,"
250,WAR IS KIND,Sleepily fondle her body
251,WAR IS KIND,"Or move at her will, swishing stealthily over"
252,WAR IS KIND,the sand.
253,WAR IS KIND,The snakes whisper softly;
254,WAR IS KIND,"The whispering, whispering snakes,"
255,WAR IS KIND,"Dreaming and swaying and staring,"
256,WAR IS KIND,"But always whispering, softly whispering."
257,WAR IS KIND,The wind streams from the lone reaches
258,WAR IS KIND,"Of Arabia, solemn with night,"
259,WAR IS KIND,And the wild fire makes shimmer of blood
260,WAR IS KIND,Over the robes of the hooded men
261,WAR IS KIND,Squat and dumb.
262,WAR IS KIND,
263,WAR IS KIND,"Bands of moving bronze, emerald, yellow,"
264,WAR IS KIND,"Circle the throat and arms of her,"
265,WAR IS KIND,And over the sands serpents move warily
266,WAR IS KIND,"Slow, menacing and submissive,"
267,WAR IS KIND,"Swinging to the whistles and drums,"
268,WAR IS KIND,"The whispering, whispering snakes,"
269,WAR IS KIND,"Dreaming and swaying and staring,"
270,WAR IS KIND,"But always whispering, softly whispering."
271,WAR IS KIND,The dignity of the accursed;
272,WAR IS KIND,"The glory of slavery, despair, death,"
273,WAR IS KIND,Is in the dance of the whispering snakes.
274,WAR IS KIND,
275,WAR IS KIND,
276,WAR IS KIND,
277,WAR IS KIND,
278,WAR IS KIND,A newspaper is a collection of half-injustices
279,WAR IS KIND,"Which, bawled by boys from mile to mile,"
280,WAR IS KIND,Spreads its curious opinion
281,WAR IS KIND,"To a million merciful and sneering men,"
282,WAR IS KIND,While families cuddle the joys of the fireside
283,WAR IS KIND,When spurred by tale of dire lone agony.
284,WAR IS KIND,A newspaper is a court
285,WAR IS KIND,Where every one is kindly and unfairly tried
286,WAR IS KIND,By a squalor of honest men.
287,WAR IS KIND,A newspaper is a market
288,WAR IS KIND,Where wisdom sells its freedom
289,WAR IS KIND,And melons are crowned by the crowd.
290,WAR IS KIND,A newspaper is a game
291,WAR IS KIND,Where his error scores the player victory
292,WAR IS KIND,While another's skill wins death.
293,WAR IS KIND,A newspaper is a symbol;
294,WAR IS KIND,"It is fetless life's chronical,"
295,WAR IS KIND,A collection of loud tales
296,WAR IS KIND,"Concentrating eternal stupidities,"
297,WAR IS KIND,"That in remote ages lived unhaltered,"
298,WAR IS KIND,Roaming through a fenceless world.
299,WAR IS KIND,
300,WAR IS KIND,
301,WAR IS KIND,
302,WAR IS KIND,
303,WAR IS KIND,"The wayfarer,"
304,WAR IS KIND,"Perceiving the pathway to truth,"
305,WAR IS KIND,Was struck with astonishment.
306,WAR IS KIND,It was thickly grown with weeds.
307,WAR IS KIND,"""Ha,"" he said,"
308,WAR IS KIND,"""I see that none has passed here"
309,WAR IS KIND,"""In a long time."""
310,WAR IS KIND,Later he saw that each weed
311,WAR IS KIND,Was a singular knife.
312,WAR IS KIND,"""Well,"" he mumbled at last,"
313,WAR IS KIND,"""Doubtless there are other roads."""
314,WAR IS KIND,
315,WAR IS KIND,
316,WAR IS KIND,
317,WAR IS KIND,
318,WAR IS KIND,"A slant of sun on dull brown walls,"
319,WAR IS KIND,A forgotten sky of bashful blue.
320,WAR IS KIND,
321,WAR IS KIND,"Toward God a mighty hymn,"
322,WAR IS KIND,"A song of collisions and cries,"
323,WAR IS KIND,"Rumbling wheels, hoof-beats, bells,"
324,WAR IS KIND,"Welcomes, farewells, love-calls, final moans,"
325,WAR IS KIND,"Voices of joy, idiocy, warning, despair,"
326,WAR IS KIND,"The unknown appeals of brutes,"
327,WAR IS KIND,"The chanting of flowers,"
328,WAR IS KIND,"The screams of cut trees,"
329,WAR IS KIND,The senseless babble of hens and wise men--
330,WAR IS KIND,A cluttered incoherency that says at the
331,WAR IS KIND,stars;
332,WAR IS KIND,"""O God, save us!"""
333,WAR IS KIND,
334,WAR IS KIND,
335,WAR IS KIND,
336,WAR IS KIND,
337,WAR IS KIND,Once a man clambering to the housetops
338,WAR IS KIND,Appealed to the heavens.
339,WAR IS KIND,With a strong voice he called to the deaf
340,WAR IS KIND,spheres;
341,WAR IS KIND,A warrior's shout he raised to the suns.
342,WAR IS KIND,"Lo, at last, there was a dot on the clouds,"
343,WAR IS KIND,And--at last and at last--
344,WAR IS KIND,--God--the sky was filled with armies.
345,WAR IS KIND,
346,WAR IS KIND,
347,WAR IS KIND,
348,WAR IS KIND,
349,WAR IS KIND,There was a man with tongue of wood
350,WAR IS KIND,"Who essayed to sing,"
351,WAR IS KIND,And in truth it was lamentable.
352,WAR IS KIND,But there was one who heard
353,WAR IS KIND,The clip-clapper of this tongue of wood
354,WAR IS KIND,And knew what the man
355,WAR IS KIND,"Wished to sing,"
356,WAR IS KIND,And with that the singer was content.
357,WAR IS KIND,
358,WAR IS KIND,
359,WAR IS KIND,
360,WAR IS KIND,
361,WAR IS KIND,The successful man has thrust himself
362,WAR IS KIND,"Through the water of the years,"
363,WAR IS KIND,"Reeking wet with mistakes,--"
364,WAR IS KIND,Bloody mistakes;
365,WAR IS KIND,"Slimed with victories over the lesser,"
366,WAR IS KIND,A figure thankful on the shore of money.
367,WAR IS KIND,"Then, with the bones of fools"
368,WAR IS KIND,He buys silken banners
369,WAR IS KIND,Limned with his triumphant face;
370,WAR IS KIND,With the skins of wise men
371,WAR IS KIND,He buys the trivial bows of all.
372,WAR IS KIND,Flesh painted with marrow
373,WAR IS KIND,"Contributes a coverlet,"
374,WAR IS KIND,A coverlet for his contented slumber.
375,WAR IS KIND,"In guiltless ignorance, in ignorant guilt,"
376,WAR IS KIND,He delivered his secrets to the riven multitude.
377,WAR IS KIND,"""Thus I defended: Thus I wrought."""
378,WAR IS KIND,"Complacent, smiling,"
379,WAR IS KIND,He stands heavily on the dead.
380,WAR IS KIND,Erect on a pillar of skulls
381,WAR IS KIND,He declaims his trampling of babes;
382,WAR IS KIND,"Smirking, fat, dripping,"
383,WAR IS KIND,"He makes speech in guiltless ignorance,"
384,WAR IS KIND,Innocence.
385,WAR IS KIND,
386,WAR IS KIND,
387,WAR IS KIND,
388,WAR IS KIND,
389,WAR IS KIND,In the night
390,WAR IS KIND,"Grey heavy clouds muffled the valleys,"
391,WAR IS KIND,And the peaks looked toward God alone.
392,WAR IS KIND,"""O Master that movest the wind with a"
393,WAR IS KIND,"finger,"
394,WAR IS KIND,"""Humble, idle, futile peaks are we."
395,WAR IS KIND,"""Grant that we may run swiftly across"
396,WAR IS KIND,the world
397,WAR IS KIND,"""To huddle in worship at Thy feet."""
398,WAR IS KIND,
399,WAR IS KIND,In the morning
400,WAR IS KIND,"A noise of men at work came the clear blue miles,"
401,WAR IS KIND,And the little black cities were apparent.
402,WAR IS KIND,"""O Master that knowest the meaning of raindrops,"
403,WAR IS KIND,"""Humble, idle, futile peaks are we."
404,WAR IS KIND,"""Give voice to us, we pray, O Lord,"
405,WAR IS KIND,"""That we may sing Thy goodness to the sun."""
406,WAR IS KIND,In the evening
407,WAR IS KIND,The far valleys were sprinkled with tiny lights.
408,WAR IS KIND,"""O Master,"
409,WAR IS KIND,"""Thou that knowest the value of kings and birds,"
410,WAR IS KIND,"""Thou hast made us humble, idle, futile peaks."
411,WAR IS KIND,"""Thous only needest eternal patience;"
412,WAR IS KIND,"""We bow to Thy wisdom, O Lord--"
413,WAR IS KIND,"""Humble, idle, futile peaks."""
414,WAR IS KIND,
415,WAR IS KIND,In the night
416,WAR IS KIND,"Grey heavy clouds muffles the valleys,"
417,WAR IS KIND,And the peaks looked toward God alone.
418,WAR IS KIND,
419,WAR IS KIND,
420,WAR IS KIND,
421,WAR IS KIND,The chatter of a death-demon from a tree-top.
422,WAR IS KIND,
423,WAR IS KIND,Blood--blood and torn grass--
424,WAR IS KIND,Had marked the rise of his agony--
425,WAR IS KIND,This lone hunter.
426,WAR IS KIND,The grey-green woods impassive
427,WAR IS KIND,Had watched the threshing of his limbs.
428,WAR IS KIND,
429,WAR IS KIND,"A canoe with flashing paddle,"
430,WAR IS KIND,"A girl with soft searching eyes,"
431,WAR IS KIND,"A call: ""John!"""
432,WAR IS KIND,.    .    .    .    .    .    .
433,WAR IS KIND,"Come, arise, hunter!"
434,WAR IS KIND,Can you not hear?
435,WAR IS KIND,
436,WAR IS KIND,The chatter of a death-demon from a tree-
437,WAR IS KIND,top.
438,WAR IS KIND,
439,WAR IS KIND,
440,WAR IS KIND,
441,WAR IS KIND,The impact of a dollar upon the heart
442,WAR IS KIND,"Smiles warm red light,"
443,WAR IS KIND,Sweeping from the hearth rosily upon the
444,WAR IS KIND,"white table,"
445,WAR IS KIND,With the hanging cool velvet shadows
446,WAR IS KIND,Moving softly upon the door.
447,WAR IS KIND,
448,WAR IS KIND,The impact of a million dollars
449,WAR IS KIND,"Is a crash of flunkys,"
450,WAR IS KIND,And yawning emblems of Persia
451,WAR IS KIND,"Cheeked against oak, France and a sabre,"
452,WAR IS KIND,The outcry of old beauty
453,WAR IS KIND,Whored by pimping merchants
454,WAR IS KIND,To submission before wine and chatter.
455,WAR IS KIND,"Silly rich peasants stamp the carpets of men,"
456,WAR IS KIND,Dead men who dreamed fragrance and light
457,WAR IS KIND,"Into their woof, their lives;"
458,WAR IS KIND,The rug of an honest bear
459,WAR IS KIND,Under the feet of a cryptic slave
460,WAR IS KIND,"Who speaks always of baubles,"
461,WAR IS KIND,"Forgetting state, multitude, work, and state,"
462,WAR IS KIND,"Champing and mouthing of hats,"
463,WAR IS KIND,"Making ratful squeak of hats,"
464,WAR IS KIND,Hats.
465,WAR IS KIND,
466,WAR IS KIND,
467,WAR IS KIND,
468,WAR IS KIND,A man said to the universe:
469,WAR IS KIND,"""Sir, I exist!"""
470,WAR IS KIND,"""However,"" replied the universe,"
471,WAR IS KIND,"""The fact has not created in me"
472,WAR IS KIND,"""A sense of obligation."""
473,WAR IS KIND,
474,WAR IS KIND,
475,WAR IS KIND,
476,WAR IS KIND,"When the prophet, a complacent fat"
477,WAR IS KIND,"man,"
478,WAR IS KIND,"Arrived at the mountain-top,"
479,WAR IS KIND,"He cried: ""Woe to my knowledge!"
480,WAR IS KIND,"""I intended to see good white lands"
481,WAR IS KIND,"""And bad black lands,"
482,WAR IS KIND,"""But the scene is grey."""
483,WAR IS KIND,
484,WAR IS KIND,
485,WAR IS KIND,
486,WAR IS KIND,There was a land where lived no
487,WAR IS KIND,violets.
488,WAR IS KIND,"A traveller at once demanded: ""Why?"""
489,WAR IS KIND,The people told him:
490,WAR IS KIND,"""Once the violets of this place spoke thus:"
491,WAR IS KIND,"""'Until some woman freely give her lover"
492,WAR IS KIND,"""'To another woman"
493,WAR IS KIND,"""'We will fight in bloody scuffle.'"""
494,WAR IS KIND,Sadly the people added:
495,WAR IS KIND,"""There are no violets here."""
496,WAR IS KIND,
497,WAR IS KIND,
498,WAR IS KIND,
499,WAR IS KIND,There was one I met upon the road
500,WAR IS KIND,Who looked at me with kind eyes.
501,WAR IS KIND,"He said: ""Show me of your wares."""
502,WAR IS KIND,"And I did,"
503,WAR IS KIND,"Holding forth one,"
504,WAR IS KIND,"He said: ""It is a sin."""
505,WAR IS KIND,Then I held forth another.
506,WAR IS KIND,"He said: ""It is a sin."""
507,WAR IS KIND,Then I held forth another.
508,WAR IS KIND,"He said: ""It is a sin."""
509,WAR IS KIND,And so to the end.
510,WAR IS KIND,"Always He said: ""It is a sin."""
511,WAR IS KIND,"At last, I cried out:"
512,WAR IS KIND,"""But I have non other."""
513,WAR IS KIND,He looked at me
514,WAR IS KIND,With kinder eyes.
515,WAR IS KIND,"""Poor soul,"" he said."
516,WAR IS KIND,
517,WAR IS KIND,
518,WAR IS KIND,
519,WAR IS KIND,"Aye, workman, make me a dream,"
520,WAR IS KIND,A dream for my love.
521,WAR IS KIND,"Cunningly weave sunlight,"
522,WAR IS KIND,"Breezes, and flowers."
523,WAR IS KIND,Let it be of the cloth of meadows.
524,WAR IS KIND,And--good workman--
525,WAR IS KIND,And let there be a man walking thereon.
526,WAR IS KIND,
527,WAR IS KIND,
528,WAR IS KIND,
529,WAR IS KIND,"Each small gleam was a voice,"
530,WAR IS KIND,A lantern voice--
531,WAR IS KIND,"In little songs of carmine, violet, green, gold."
532,WAR IS KIND,A chorus of colors came over the water;
533,WAR IS KIND,"The wondrous leaf-shadow no longer wavered,"
534,WAR IS KIND,"No pines crooned on the hills,"
535,WAR IS KIND,"The blue night was elsewhere a silence,"
536,WAR IS KIND,When the chorus of colors came over the
537,WAR IS KIND,"water,"
538,WAR IS KIND,"Little songs of carmine, violet, green, gold."
539,WAR IS KIND,
540,WAR IS KIND,Small glowing pebbles
541,WAR IS KIND,Thrown on the dark plane of evening
542,WAR IS KIND,Sing good ballads of God
543,WAR IS KIND,"And eternity, with soul's rest."
544,WAR IS KIND,"Little priests, little holy fathers,"
545,WAR IS KIND,None can doubt the truth of hour hymning.
546,WAR IS KIND,When the marvellous chorus comes over the
547,WAR IS KIND,"water,"
548,WAR IS KIND,"Songs of carmine, violet, green, gold."
549,WAR IS KIND,
550,WAR IS KIND,
551,WAR IS KIND,
552,WAR IS KIND,The trees in the garden rained flowers.
553,WAR IS KIND,Children ran there joyously.
554,WAR IS KIND,They gathered the flowers
555,WAR IS KIND,Each to himself.
556,WAR IS KIND,Now there were some
557,WAR IS KIND,Who gathered great heaps--
558,WAR IS KIND,Having opportunity and skill--
559,WAR IS KIND,"Until, behold, only chance blossoms"
560,WAR IS KIND,Remained for the feeble.
561,WAR IS KIND,Then a little spindling tutor
562,WAR IS KIND,"Ran importantly to the father, crying:"
563,WAR IS KIND,"""Pray, come hither!"
564,WAR IS KIND,"""See this unjust thing in your garden!"""
565,WAR IS KIND,"But when the father had surveyed,"
566,WAR IS KIND,He admonished the tutor:
567,WAR IS KIND,"""Not so, small sage!"
568,WAR IS KIND,"""This thing is just."
569,WAR IS KIND,"""For, look you,"
570,WAR IS KIND,"""Are not they who possess the flowers"
571,WAR IS KIND,"""Stronger, bolder, shrewder"
572,WAR IS KIND,"""Than they who have none?"
573,WAR IS KIND,"""Why should the strong--"
574,WAR IS KIND,"""The beautiful strong--"
575,WAR IS KIND,"""Why should they not have the flowers?"
576,WAR IS KIND,
577,WAR IS KIND,"Upon reflection, the tutor bowed to the"
578,WAR IS KIND,ground.
579,WAR IS KIND,"""My lord,"" he said,"
580,WAR IS KIND,"""The stars are displaced"
581,WAR IS KIND,"""By this towering wisdom."""
582,WAR IS KIND,
583,WAR IS KIND,
584,WAR IS KIND,
585,WAR IS KIND,
586,INTRIGUE,INTRIGUE
587,INTRIGUE,
588,INTRIGUE,"Thou art my love,"
589,INTRIGUE,And thou art the peace of sundown
590,INTRIGUE,"When the blue shadows soothe,"
591,INTRIGUE,And the grasses and the leaves sleep
592,INTRIGUE,"To the song of the little brooks,"
593,INTRIGUE,Woe is me.
594,INTRIGUE,
595,INTRIGUE,"Thou art my love,"
596,INTRIGUE,And thou art a strorm
597,INTRIGUE,"That breaks black in the sky,"
598,INTRIGUE,"And, sweeping headlong,"
599,INTRIGUE,"Drenches and cowers each tree,"
600,INTRIGUE,And at the panting end
601,INTRIGUE,There is no sound
602,INTRIGUE,Save the melancholy cry of a single owl--
603,INTRIGUE,Woe is me!
604,INTRIGUE,
605,INTRIGUE,"Thou are my love,"
606,INTRIGUE,"And thou art a tinsel thing,"
607,INTRIGUE,And I in my play
608,INTRIGUE,"Broke thee easily,"
609,INTRIGUE,And from the little fragments
610,INTRIGUE,Arose my long sorrow--
611,INTRIGUE,Woe is me.
612,INTRIGUE,
613,INTRIGUE,"Thou art my love,"
614,INTRIGUE,"And thou art a wary violet,"
615,INTRIGUE,"Drooping from sun-caresses,"
616,INTRIGUE,Answering mine carelessly--
617,INTRIGUE,Woe is me.
618,INTRIGUE,
619,INTRIGUE,"Thou art my love,"
620,INTRIGUE,"And thou art the ashes of other men's love,"
621,INTRIGUE,"And I bury my face in these ashes,"
622,INTRIGUE,And I love them--
623,INTRIGUE,Woe is me.
624,INTRIGUE,
625,INTRIGUE,"Thou art my love,"
626,INTRIGUE,And thou art the beard
627,INTRIGUE,On another man's face--
628,INTRIGUE,Woe is me.
629,INTRIGUE,
630,INTRIGUE,"Thou art my love,"
631,INTRIGUE,"And thou art a temple,"
632,INTRIGUE,"And in this temple is an altar,"
633,INTRIGUE,And on this altar is my heart--
634,INTRIGUE,Woe is me.
635,INTRIGUE,
636,INTRIGUE,"Thou art my love,"
637,INTRIGUE,And thou art a wretch.
638,INTRIGUE,"Let these sacred love-lies choke thee,"
639,INTRIGUE,From I am come to where I know your lies
640,INTRIGUE,as truth
641,INTRIGUE,And you truth as lies--
642,INTRIGUE,Woe is me.
643,INTRIGUE,
644,INTRIGUE,"Thou art my love,"
645,INTRIGUE,"And thou art a priestess,"
646,INTRIGUE,"And in they hand is a bloody dagger,"
647,INTRIGUE,And my doom comes to me surely--
648,INTRIGUE,Woe is me.
649,INTRIGUE,
650,INTRIGUE,"Thou art my love,"
651,INTRIGUE,"And thou art a skull with ruby eyes,"
652,INTRIGUE,And I love thee--
653,INTRIGUE,Woe is me.
654,INTRIGUE,
655,INTRIGUE,"Thou art my love,"
656,INTRIGUE,And I doubt thee.
657,INTRIGUE,And if peace came with thy murder
658,INTRIGUE,Then would I murder--
659,INTRIGUE,Woe is me.
660,INTRIGUE,
661,INTRIGUE,"Thou art my love,"
662,INTRIGUE,"And thou art death,"
663,INTRIGUE,"Aye, thou art death"
664,INTRIGUE,"Black and yet black,"
665,INTRIGUE,"But I love thee,"
666,INTRIGUE,I love thee--
667,INTRIGUE,"Woe, welcome woe, to me."
668,INTRIGUE,
669,INTRIGUE,
670,INTRIGUE,
671,INTRIGUE,
672,INTRIGUE,"Love, forgive me if I wish you grief,"
673,INTRIGUE,For in your grief
674,INTRIGUE,"You huddle to my breast,"
675,INTRIGUE,And for it
676,INTRIGUE,Would I pay the price of your grief.
677,INTRIGUE,
678,INTRIGUE,You walk among men
679,INTRIGUE,"And all men do not surrender,"
680,INTRIGUE,And thus I understand
681,INTRIGUE,That love reaches his hand
682,INTRIGUE,In mercy to me.
683,INTRIGUE,
684,INTRIGUE,"He had your picture in his room,"
685,INTRIGUE,"A scurvy traitor picture,"
686,INTRIGUE,And he smiled
687,INTRIGUE,--Merely a fat complacence of men who
688,INTRIGUE,know fine women--
689,INTRIGUE,And thus I divided with him
690,INTRIGUE,A part of my love.
691,INTRIGUE,
692,INTRIGUE,"Fool, not to know that thy little shoe"
693,INTRIGUE,Can make men weep!
694,INTRIGUE,--Some men weep.
695,INTRIGUE,"I weep and I gnash,"
696,INTRIGUE,"And I love the little shoe,"
697,INTRIGUE,"The little, little shoe."
698,INTRIGUE,
699,INTRIGUE,"God give me medals,"
700,INTRIGUE,"God give me loud honors,"
701,INTRIGUE,"That I may strut before you, sweetheart,"
702,INTRIGUE,And be worthy of--
703,INTRIGUE,The love I bear you.
704,INTRIGUE,
705,INTRIGUE,Now let me crunch you
706,INTRIGUE,With full weight of affrighted love.
707,INTRIGUE,I doubted you
708,INTRIGUE,--I doubted you--
709,INTRIGUE,And in this short doubting
710,INTRIGUE,My love grew like a genie
711,INTRIGUE,For my further undoing.
712,INTRIGUE,
713,INTRIGUE,"Beware of my friends,"
714,INTRIGUE,"Be not in speech too civil,"
715,INTRIGUE,For in all courtesy
716,INTRIGUE,"My weak heart sees spectres,"
717,INTRIGUE,Mists of desire
718,INTRIGUE,Arising from the lips of my chosen;
719,INTRIGUE,Be not civil.
720,INTRIGUE,
721,INTRIGUE,The flower I gave thee once
722,INTRIGUE,"Was incident to a stride,"
723,INTRIGUE,"A detail of a gesture,"
724,INTRIGUE,But search those pale petals
725,INTRIGUE,And see engraven thereon
726,INTRIGUE,A record of my intention.
727,INTRIGUE,
728,INTRIGUE,
729,INTRIGUE,
730,INTRIGUE,
731,INTRIGUE,"Ah, God, the way your little finger moved,"
732,INTRIGUE,As you thrust a bare arm backward
733,INTRIGUE,And made play with your hair
734,INTRIGUE,"And a comb, a silly gilt comb"
735,INTRIGUE,"--Ah, God--that I should suffer"
736,INTRIGUE,Because of the way a little finger moved.
737,INTRIGUE,
738,INTRIGUE,
739,INTRIGUE,
740,INTRIGUE,
741,INTRIGUE,Once I saw thee idly rocking
742,INTRIGUE,--Idly rocking--
743,INTRIGUE,"And chattering girlishly to other girls,"
744,INTRIGUE,"Bell-voiced, happy,"
745,INTRIGUE,Careless with the stout heart of unscarred
746,INTRIGUE,"womanhood,"
747,INTRIGUE,And life to thee was all light melody.
748,INTRIGUE,I thought of the great storms of love as I
749,INTRIGUE,"knew it,"
750,INTRIGUE,"Torn, miserable, and ashamed of my open"
751,INTRIGUE,"sorrow,"
752,INTRIGUE,I thought of the thunders that lived in my
753,INTRIGUE,"head,"
754,INTRIGUE,"And I wish to be an ogre,"
755,INTRIGUE,"And hale and haul my beloved to a castle,"
756,INTRIGUE,And make her mourn with my mourning.
757,INTRIGUE,
758,INTRIGUE,
759,INTRIGUE,
760,INTRIGUE,
761,INTRIGUE,"Tell me why, behind thee,"
762,INTRIGUE,I see always the shadow of another lover?
763,INTRIGUE,"Is it real,"
764,INTRIGUE,Or is this the thrice damned memory of a
765,INTRIGUE,better happiness?
766,INTRIGUE,"Plague on him if he be dead,"
767,INTRIGUE,Plague on him if he be alive--
768,INTRIGUE,A swinish numskull
769,INTRIGUE,To intrude his shade
770,INTRIGUE,Always between me and my peace!
771,INTRIGUE,
772,INTRIGUE,
773,INTRIGUE,
774,INTRIGUE,
775,INTRIGUE,And yet I have seen thee happy with me.
776,INTRIGUE,I am no fool
777,INTRIGUE,To poll stupidly into iron.
778,INTRIGUE,I have heard your quick breaths
779,INTRIGUE,And seen your arms writhe toward me;
780,INTRIGUE,At those times
781,INTRIGUE,--God help us--
782,INTRIGUE,"I was impelled to be a grand knight,"
783,INTRIGUE,"And swagger and snap my fingers,"
784,INTRIGUE,And explain my mind finely.
785,INTRIGUE,"Oh, lost sweetheart,"
786,INTRIGUE,I would that I had not been a grand knight.
787,INTRIGUE,"I said: ""Sweetheart."""
788,INTRIGUE,"Thou said'st: ""Sweetheart."""
789,INTRIGUE,And we preserved an admirable mimicry
790,INTRIGUE,Without heeding the drip of the blood
791,INTRIGUE,From my heart.
792,INTRIGUE,
793,INTRIGUE,
794,INTRIGUE,
795,INTRIGUE,
796,INTRIGUE,"I heard thee laugh,"
797,INTRIGUE,And in this merriment
798,INTRIGUE,I defined the measure of my pain;
799,INTRIGUE,"I knew that I was alone,"
800,INTRIGUE,"Alone with love,"
801,INTRIGUE,"Poor shivering love,"
802,INTRIGUE,"And he, little sprite,"
803,INTRIGUE,"Came to watch with me,"
804,INTRIGUE,"And at midnight,"
805,INTRIGUE,We were like two creatures by a dead camp-fire.
806,INTRIGUE,
807,INTRIGUE,
808,INTRIGUE,
809,INTRIGUE,
810,INTRIGUE,"I wonder if sometimes in the dusk,"
811,INTRIGUE,When the brave lights that gild thy
812,INTRIGUE,evenings
813,INTRIGUE,"Have not yet been touched with flame,"
814,INTRIGUE,I wonder if sometimes in the dusk
815,INTRIGUE,"Thou rememberest a time,"
816,INTRIGUE,A time when thou loved me
817,INTRIGUE,And our love was to thee thy all?
818,INTRIGUE,Is the memory rubbish now?
819,INTRIGUE,An old gown
820,INTRIGUE,Worn in an age of other fashions?
821,INTRIGUE,"Woe is me, oh, lost one,"
822,INTRIGUE,For that love is now to me
823,INTRIGUE,"A supernal dream,"
824,INTRIGUE,"White, white, white with many suns."
825,INTRIGUE,
826,INTRIGUE,
827,INTRIGUE,
828,INTRIGUE,
829,INTRIGUE,"Love met me at noonday,"
830,INTRIGUE,"--Reckless imp,"
831,INTRIGUE,To leave his shaded nights
832,INTRIGUE,"And brave the glare,--"
833,INTRIGUE,And I saw him then plainly
834,INTRIGUE,"For a bungler,"
835,INTRIGUE,"A stupid, simpering, eyeless bungler,"
836,INTRIGUE,Breaking the hearts of brave people
837,INTRIGUE,"As the snivelling idiot-boy cracks his bowl,"
838,INTRIGUE,"And I cursed him,"
839,INTRIGUE,"Cursed him to and fro, back and forth,"
840,INTRIGUE,"Into all the silly mazes of his mind,"
841,INTRIGUE,But in the end
842,INTRIGUE,"He laughed and pointed to my breast,"
843,INTRIGUE,"Where a heart still beat for thee, beloved."
844,INTRIGUE,
845,INTRIGUE,
846,INTRIGUE,
847,INTRIGUE,
848,INTRIGUE,I have seen thy face aflame
849,INTRIGUE,"For love of me,"
850,INTRIGUE,"Thy fair arms go mad,"
851,INTRIGUE,Thy lips tremble and mutter and rave.
852,INTRIGUE,And--surely--
853,INTRIGUE,This should leave a man content?
854,INTRIGUE,"Thou lovest not me now,"
855,INTRIGUE,"But thou didst love me,"
856,INTRIGUE,And in loving me once
857,INTRIGUE,"Thou gavest me an eternal privilege,"
858,INTRIGUE,For I can think of thee.
859,INTRIGUE,
