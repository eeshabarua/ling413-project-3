100,APPREHENSION,Roars like a beast in a cave
101,APPREHENSION,That is wounded there
102,APPREHENSION,And like to drown;
103,APPREHENSION,"While days rush, wave after wave"
104,APPREHENSION,On its lair.
105,APPREHENSION,
106,APPREHENSION,An invisible woe unseals
107,APPREHENSION,"The flood, so it passes beyond"
108,APPREHENSION,All bounds: the great old city
109,APPREHENSION,Recumbent roars as it feels
110,APPREHENSION,The foamy paw of the pond
111,APPREHENSION,Reach from immensity.
112,APPREHENSION,
113,APPREHENSION,But all that it can do
114,APPREHENSION,"Now, as the tide rises,"
115,APPREHENSION,Is to listen and hear the grim
116,APPREHENSION,Waves crash like thunder through
117,APPREHENSION,"The splintered streets, hear noises"
118,APPREHENSION,Roll hollow in the interim.

126,COMING AWAKE,"And a hairy, big bee hung over the primulas"
127,COMING AWAKE,"In the window, his body black fur, and the sound"

129,COMING AWAKE,
130,COMING AWAKE,There was something I ought to remember: and
131,COMING AWAKE,yet
132,COMING AWAKE,I did not remember. Why should I? The run-

141,FROM A COLLEGE WINDOW,"THE glimmer of the limes, sun-heavy, sleeping,"
142,FROM A COLLEGE WINDOW,Goes trembling past me up the College wall.

149,FROM A COLLEGE WINDOW,Going left and right.

160,FLAPPER,LOVE has crept out of her sealéd heart
161,FLAPPER,"As a field-bee, black and amber,"
162,FLAPPER,"Breaks from the winter-cell, to clamber"
163,FLAPPER,Up the warm grass where the sunbeams start.
164,FLAPPER,
165,FLAPPER,"Mischief has come in her dawning eyes,"
166,FLAPPER,And a glint of coloured iris brings
167,FLAPPER,Such as lies along the folded wings
168,FLAPPER,Of the bee before he flies.
169,FLAPPER,
170,FLAPPER,"Who, with a ruffling, careful breath,"
171,FLAPPER,Has opened the wings of the wild young sprite?
172,FLAPPER,Has fluttered her spirit to stumbling flight
173,FLAPPER,"In her eyes, as a young bee stumbleth?"
174,FLAPPER,
175,FLAPPER,Love makes the burden of her voice.
176,FLAPPER,"The hum of his heavy, staggering wings"
177,FLAPPER,Sets quivering with wisdom the common
178,FLAPPER,things
179,FLAPPER,"That she says, and her words rejoice."

187,BIRDCAGE WALK,When the wind blows her veil
188,BIRDCAGE WALK,From the woes I bewail

197,ALMOND TREE,YOU promised to send me some violets. Did you
198,ALMOND TREE,forget?
199,ALMOND TREE,White ones and blue ones from under the orchard

201,ALMOND TREE,"Sweet dark purple, and white ones mixed for a"
202,ALMOND TREE,pledge
203,ALMOND TREE,Of our early love that hardly has opened yet.
204,ALMOND TREE,
205,ALMOND TREE,Here there's an almond tree--you have never seen
206,ALMOND TREE,"Such a one in the north--it flowers on the street,"
207,ALMOND TREE,and I stand
208,ALMOND TREE,Every day by the fence to look up for the flowers
209,ALMOND TREE,that expand
210,ALMOND TREE,"At rest in the blue, and wonder at what they mean."
211,ALMOND TREE,
212,ALMOND TREE,"Under the almond tree, the happy lands"
213,ALMOND TREE,"Provence, Japan, and Italy repose,"
214,ALMOND TREE,And passing feet are chatter and clapping of
215,ALMOND TREE,those
216,ALMOND TREE,"Who play around us, country girls clapping their"
217,ALMOND TREE,hands.
218,ALMOND TREE,
219,ALMOND TREE,"You, my love, the foremost, in a flowered gown,"
220,ALMOND TREE,"All your unbearable tenderness, you with the"

234,MORNING,Its square shadows.
235,MORNING,
236,MORNING,The pink young houses show one side bright
237,MORNING,"Flatly assuming the sun,"
238,MORNING,"And one side shadow, half in sight,"
239,MORNING,Half-hiding the pavement-run;
240,MORNING,
241,MORNING,Where hastening creatures pass intent
242,MORNING,"On their level way,"

244,MORNING,And have nothing to say.
245,MORNING,
246,MORNING,Bare stems of street-lamps stiffly stand

256,THIEF IN THE NIGHT,And struck at me with something dark.
257,THIEF IN THE NIGHT,"I cried, but no one could hear me,"
258,THIEF IN THE NIGHT,I lay dumb and stark.
259,THIEF IN THE NIGHT,
260,THIEF IN THE NIGHT,When I awoke this morning
261,THIEF IN THE NIGHT,I could find no trace;
262,THIEF IN THE NIGHT,"Perhaps 'twas a dream of warning,"
263,THIEF IN THE NIGHT,For I've lost my peace.

274,GREY EVENING IN MARCH,red-fire seas running through
275,GREY EVENING IN MARCH,The rocks where ravens flying to windward melt
276,GREY EVENING IN MARCH,as a well-shot lance.

281,GREY EVENING IN MARCH,northern wind-flowers shaken astir.

291,GREY EVENING IN MARCH,It is well for you. For me the navvies work in the
292,GREY EVENING IN MARCH,road where I pass
293,GREY EVENING IN MARCH,And I want to smite in anger the barren rock of
294,GREY EVENING IN MARCH,each waterless brow.

299,GREY EVENING IN MARCH,soul to hear
300,GREY EVENING IN MARCH,The voice of the furtive triumphant engine as it
