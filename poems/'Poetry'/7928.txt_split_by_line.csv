38,PREFACE,
39,PREFACE,Utterances of poets regarding their character and mission have perhaps
40,PREFACE,received less attention than they deserve. The tacit assumption of the
41,PREFACE,"majority of critics seems to be that the poet, like the criminal, is the"
42,PREFACE,last man who should pass judgment upon his own case. Yet it is by no
43,PREFACE,means certain that this view is correct. Introspective analysis on the
44,PREFACE,part of the poet might reasonably be expected to be as productive of
45,PREFACE,æsthetic revelation as the more objective criticism of the mere observer
46,PREFACE,"of literary phenomena. Moreover, aside from its intrinsic merits, the"
47,PREFACE,poet's self-exposition must have interest for all students of Platonic
48,PREFACE,"philosophy, inasmuch as Plato's famous challenge was directed only"
49,PREFACE,"incidentally to critics of poetry; primarily it was to Poetry herself,"
50,PREFACE,whom he urged to make just such lyrical defense as we are to consider.
51,PREFACE,
52,PREFACE,The method here employed is not to present exhaustively the substance of
53,PREFACE,"individual poems treating of poets. Analysis of Wordsworth's _Prelude,_"
54,PREFACE,"Browning's _Sordello,_ and the like, could scarcely give more than a"
55,PREFACE,re-presentation of what is already available to the reader in notes and
56,PREFACE,essays on those poems. The purpose here is rather to pass in review the
57,PREFACE,main body of such verse written in the last one hundred and fifty years.
58,PREFACE,"We are concerned, to be sure, with pointing out idiosyncratic"
59,PREFACE,"conceptions of individual writers, and with tracing the vogue of passing"
60,PREFACE,"theories. The chief interest, however, should lie in the discovery of an"
61,PREFACE,essential unity in many poets' views on their own character and mission.
62,PREFACE,
63,PREFACE,It is true that there is scarcely an idea relative to the poet which is
64,PREFACE,"not somewhere contradicted in the verse of this period, and the attempt"
65,PREFACE,has been made to be wholly impartial in presenting all sides of each
66,PREFACE,"question. Indeed, the subject may seem to be one in which dualism is"
67,PREFACE,"inescapable. The poet is, in one sense, a hybrid creature; he is the"
68,PREFACE,"lover of the sensual and of the spiritual, for he is the revealer of the"
69,PREFACE,spiritual in the sensual. Consequently it is not strange that
70,PREFACE,"practically every utterance which we may consider,--even such as deal"
71,PREFACE,"with the most superficial aspects of the poet, as his physical beauty or"
72,PREFACE,"his health,--falls naturally into one of two divisions, accordingly as"
73,PREFACE,the poet feels the sensual or the spiritual aspect of his nature to be
74,PREFACE,the more important Yet the fact remains that the quest of unity has been
75,PREFACE,the most interesting feature of this investigation. The man in whose
76,PREFACE,nature the poet's two apparently contradictory desires shall wholly
77,PREFACE,harmonize is the ideal whom practically all modern English poets are
78,PREFACE,attempting to present.
79,PREFACE,
80,PREFACE,"Minor poets have been considered, perhaps to an unwarranted degree. In"
81,PREFACE,"the Victorian period, for instance, there may seem something grotesque"
82,PREFACE,"in placing Tupper's judgments on verse beside Browning's. Yet, since it"
83,PREFACE,is true that so slight a poet as William Lisles Bowles influenced
84,PREFACE,"Coleridge, and that T. E. Chivers probably influenced Poe, it seems that"
85,PREFACE,"in a study of this sort minor writers have a place. In addition, where"
86,PREFACE,"the views of one minor verse-writer might be negligible, the views of a"
87,PREFACE,"large group are frequently highly significant, not only as testifying to"
88,PREFACE,"the vogue of ephemeral ideas, but as demonstrating that great and small"
89,PREFACE,in the poetic world have the same general attitude toward their gift. It
90,PREFACE,is perhaps true that minor poets have been more loquacious on the
91,PREFACE,"subject of their nature than have greater ones, but some attempt is here"
92,PREFACE,"made to hold them within bounds, so that they may not drown out the more"
93,PREFACE,meaningful utterances of the master singers.
94,PREFACE,
95,PREFACE,"The last one hundred and fifty years have been chosen for discussion,"
96,PREFACE,since the beginning of the romantic movement marked the rise of a
97,PREFACE,"peculiarly self-conscious attitude in the poet, and brought his"
98,PREFACE,personality into new prominence. Contemporary verse seems to fall within
99,PREFACE,"the scope of these studies, inasmuch as the ""renaissance of poetry"" (as"
100,PREFACE,enthusiasts like to term the new stirring of interest in verse) is
101,PREFACE,revealing young poets of the present day even more frank in
102,PREFACE,self-revealment than were poets of twenty years ago.
103,PREFACE,
104,PREFACE,The excursion through modern English poetry involved in these studies
105,PREFACE,has been a pleasant one. The value and interest of such an investigation
106,PREFACE,was first pointed out to me by Professor Louise Pound of the University
107,PREFACE,of Nebraska. It is with sincere appreciation that I here express my
108,PREFACE,"indebtedness to her, both for the initial suggestion, and for the"
109,PREFACE,invaluable advice which I have received from her during my procedure. I
110,PREFACE,owe much gratitude also to President Wimam Allan Neilson of Smith
111,PREFACE,"College, who was formerly my teacher in Radcliffe College, and to"
112,PREFACE,"Professor Hartley Burr Alexander, of the department of Philosophy at the"
113,PREFACE,"University of Nebraska, who has given me unstinted help and generous"
114,PREFACE,encouragement.

256,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
257,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Most of us, mere men that we are, find ourselves caught in some"
258,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,entanglement of our mortal coil even before we have fairly embarked upon
259,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,the enterprise of thinking our case through. The art of self-reflection
260,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"which appeals to us as so eminent and so human, is it after all much"
261,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"more than a vaporous vanity? We name its subject ""human nature""; we give"
262,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,it a raiment of timeless generalities; but in the end the show of
263,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"thought discloses little beyond the obstreperous bit of a ""me"" which has"
264,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"blown all the fume. The ""psychologist's fallacy,"" or again the"
265,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"""egocentric predicament"" of the philosopher of the Absolute, these are"
266,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,but tagged examples of a type of futile self-return (we name it
267,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"""discovery"" to save our faces) which comes more or less to men of all"
268,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,kinds when they take honest-eyed measure of the consequences of their
269,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,own valuations of themselves. We pose for the portrait; we admire the
270,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Lion; but we have only to turn our heads to catch-glimpse Punch with
271,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"thumb to nose. And then, of course, we mock our own humiliation, which"
272,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"is another kind of vanity; and, having done this penance, pursue again"
273,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"our self-returning fate. The theme is, after all, one we cannot drop; it"
274,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,is the mortal coil.
275,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
276,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,In the moment of our revulsion from the inevitable return upon itself of
277,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"the human reason, many of us have clung with the greater desperation to"
278,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,the hope offered by poetry. By the way of intuition poets promise to
279,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,carry us beyond the boundary of the vicious circle. When the ceaseless
280,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"round of the real world has come to nauseate us, they assure us that by"
281,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,simply relaxing our hold upon actuality we may escape from the
282,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"squirrel-cage. By consenting to the prohibition, ""Bold lover, never,"
283,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"never canst thou kiss!"" we may enter the realm of ideality, where our"
284,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"dizzy brains grow steady, and our pulses are calmed, as we gaze upon the"
285,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,quietude of transcendent beauty.
286,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
287,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"But what are we to say when, on opening almost any book of comparatively"
288,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"recent verse, we find, not the self-forgetfulness attendant upon an"
289,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"ineffable vision, but advertisement of the author's importance? His"
290,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"argument we find running somewhat as follows: ""I am superior to you"
291,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"because I write poetry. What do I write poetry about? Why, about my"
292,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"superiority, of course!"" Must we not conclude that the poet, with the"
293,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"rest of us, is speeding around the hippodrome of his own self-centered"
294,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,consciousness?
295,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
296,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Indeed the poet's circle is likely to appear to us even more viciousthan
297,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"that of other men. To be sure, we remember Sir Philip Sidney's"
298,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"contention, supported by his anecdote of the loquacious horseman, that"
299,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,men of all callings are equally disposed to vaunt themselves. If the
300,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"poet seems especially voluble about his merits, this may be owing to the"
301,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"fact that, words being the tools of his trade, he is more apt than other"
302,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,men in giving expression to his self-importance. But our specific
303,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,objection to the poet is not met by this explanation. Even the horseman
304,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,does not expect panegyrics of his profession to take the place of
305,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,horseshoes. The inventor does not issue an autobiography in lieu of a
306,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,new invention. The public would seem justified in reminding the poet
307,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"that, having a reasonable amount of curiosity about human nature, it"
308,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"will eagerly devour the poet's biography, properly labeled, but only"
309,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,after he has forgotten himself long enough to write a poem that will
310,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"prove his genius, and so lend worth to the perusal of his idiosyncratic"
311,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"records, and his judgments on poetic composition."
312,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
313,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,The first impulse of our revulsion from the self-infatuated poet is to
314,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"confute him with the potent name of Aristotle, and show him his doom"
315,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"foreordained in the book of poetic Revelations. ""The poet should speak"
316,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"as little as possible in his own person,"" we read, ""for it is not this"
317,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"that makes him an imitator."" [Footnote: _Poetics_, 1460 a.] One cannot"
318,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,too much admire Aristotle's canniness in thus nipping the poet's egotism
319,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"in the bud, for he must have seen clearly that if the poet began to talk"
320,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"in his own person, he would soon lead the conversation around to"
321,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"himself, and that, once launched on that inexhaustible subject, he would"
322,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,never be ready to return to his original theme.
323,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
324,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,We may regret that we have not Aristotle's sanction for condemning also
325,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"extra-poetical advertisements of the poet's personality, as a hindrance"
326,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,to our seeing the ideal world through his poetry. In certain moods one
327,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"feels it a blessing that we possess no romantic traditions of Homer, to"
328,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,get in the way of our passing impartial judgment upon his works. Our
329,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,intimate knowledge of nineteenth century poets has been of doubtful
330,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,benefit to us. Wordsworth has shaken into what promises to be his
331,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,permanent place among the English poets much more expeditiously than has
332,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Byron. Is this not because in Wordsworth's case the reader is not
333,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,conscious of a magnetic personality drawing his judgment away from
334,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"purely aesthetic standards? Again, consider the case of Keats. For us"
335,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,the facts of his life must color almost every line he wrote. How are we
336,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"to determine whether his sonnet, _When I Have Fears,_ is great poetry or"
337,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"not, so long as it fills our minds insistently with the pity of his love"
338,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"for Fanny Brawne, and his epitaph in the Roman graveyard?"
339,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
340,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Christopher North has been much upbraided by a hero-worshiping
341,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"generation, but one may go too far in condemning the Scotch sense in his"
342,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,contention:
343,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
344,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Mr. Keats we have often heard spoken of in terms of great kindness, and"
345,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,we have no doubt that his manners and feelings are calculated to make
346,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,his friends love him. But what has all this to do with our opinion of
347,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"their poetry? What, in the name of wonder, does it concern us, whether"
348,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"these men sit among themselves with mild or with sulky faces, eating"
349,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"their mutton steaks, and drinking their porter? [Footnote: Sidney"
350,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Colvin, _John Keats,_ p. 478.]"
351,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
352,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"If we are reluctant to sponsor words printed in _Blackwoods,_ we may be"
353,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,more at ease in agreeing with the same sentiments as expressed by
354,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Keats himself. After a too protracted dinner party with Wordsworth and
355,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Hunt, Keats gave vent to his feelings as follows:"
356,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
357,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Poetry should be great and unobtrusive, a thing that enters into one's"
358,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"soul, and does not startle or amaze it with itself, but with its"
359,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,subject. How beautiful are the retired flowers! How they would lose
360,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"their beauty were they to throng into the highway crying out, ""Admire"
361,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"me, I am a violet! Dote upon me, I am a primrose!"".... I will cut all"
362,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,this--I will have no more of Wordsworth or Hunt in particular.... I
363,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"don't mean to deny Wordsworth's grandeur and Hunt's merit, but I mean to"
364,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,say that we need not be teased with grandeur and merit when we can have
365,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"them uncontaminated and unobtrusive. [Footnote: _Ibid.,_ p. 253.]"
366,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
367,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,If acquaintance with a poet prevents his contemporaries from fixing
368,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"their attention exclusively upon the merits of his verse, in how much"
369,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"better case is posterity, if the poet's personality makes its way into"
370,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,the heart of his poetry? We have Browning's dictum on Shakespeare's
371,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"sonnets,"
372,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
373,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,With this key
374,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Shakespeare unlocked his heart. Once more
375,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"_Did_ Shakespeare? If so, the less Shakespeare he."
376,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: _House._]
377,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
378,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Did Browning mean that Shakespeare was less the poet, as well as less"
379,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"the dramatist, if he revealed himself to us in his poetry? And is this"
380,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,our contention?
381,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
382,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"It seems a reasonable contention, at least, the more so since poets are"
383,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,practically unanimous in describing inspiration as lifting them out of
384,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"themselves, into self-forgetful ecstasy. Even that arch-egoist, Byron,"
385,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"concedes this point. ""To withdraw myself from myself--oh, that accursed"
386,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"selfishness,"" he writes, ""has ever been my entire, my sincere motive in"
387,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"scribbling at all."" [Footnote: Letters and Journals, ed, Rowland E."
388,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Prothero, November 26, 1813.] Surely we may complain that it is rather"
389,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,hard on us if the poet can escape from himself only by throwing himself
390,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,at the reader's head.
391,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
392,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,It would seem natural to conclude from the selflessness of inspiration
393,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"that the more frequently inspired the poet is, the less will he himself"
394,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,be an interesting subject for verse. Again we must quote Keats to
395,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"confute his more self-centered brothers. ""A poet,"" Keats says, ""is the"
396,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"most unpoetical of anything in existence, because he has no identity; he"
397,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"is continually in for, and filling, some other body. The sun, the moon,"
398,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"the stars, and men and women who are creatures of impulse are poetical"
399,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"and have about them an unchangeable attribute; the poet has none, no"
400,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"identity."" [Footnote: Letter to Richard Woodhouse, October 27, 1818.]"
401,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,The same conviction is differently phrased by Landor. The poet is a
402,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"luminous body, whose function is to reveal other objects, not himself,"
403,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,to us. Therefore Landor considers our scanty knowledge of Shakespeare as
404,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,compared with lesser poets a natural consequence of the
405,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,self-obliterating splendor of his genius:
406,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
407,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"In poetry there is but one supreme,"
408,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Though there are many angels round his throne,"
409,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Mighty and beauteous, while his face is hid."
410,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: _On Shakespeare_.]
411,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
412,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"But though an occasional poet lends his voice in support of our censure,"
413,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,the average poet would brush aside our complaints with impatience. What
414,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,right have we to accuse him of swerving from the subject matter proper
415,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"to poetry, while we appear to have no clear idea as to what the"
416,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"legitimate subject matter is?  Precisely what are we looking for, that"
417,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,we are led to complain that the massive outlines of the poet's figure
418,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,obscure our view?
419,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
420,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Now just here we who assail the poet are likely to turn our guns upon
421,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"one another, for we are brought up against the stone wall of age-old"
422,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,dispute over the function of the poet. He should hold up his magic
423,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"mirror to the physical world, some of us declare, and set the charm of"
424,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"immortality upon the life about us. Far from it, others retort. The poet"
425,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"should redeem us from the flesh, and show us the ideal forms of things,"
426,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"which bear, it may be, very slight resemblance to their imitations in"
427,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,this world.
428,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
429,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Now while we are sadly meditating our inability to batter our way
430,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"through this obstacle to perfect clarity, the poets championing the"
431,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"opposing views, like Plato's sophistic brothers, Euthydemus and"
432,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Dionysodorus, proceed to knock us from one to the other side, justifying"
433,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,their self-centered verse by either theory. Do we maintain that the poet
434,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"should reflect the life about him? Then, holding the mirror up to life,"
435,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,he will naturally be the central figure in the reflection. Do we
436,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"maintain that the poet should reveal an ideal world? Then, being alone"
437,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"of all men transported by his vision into this ideal realm, he will have"
438,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,no competitors to dispute his place as chief character.
439,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
440,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,At first thought it may have appeared obvious to us that the idealistic
441,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"poet, who claims that his art is a revelation of a transcendental"
442,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"entity, is soaring to celestial realms whither his mundane personality"
443,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,cannot follow. Leaving below him the dusty atmosphere of the actual
444,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"world, why should he not attain to ideas in their purity, uncolored by"
445,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,his own individuality? But we must in justice remember that the poet
446,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"cannot, in the same degree as the mathematician, present his ideals"
447,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"nakedly. They are, like the Phidian statues of the Fates, inseparable"
448,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,from their filmy veiling. Beauty seems to be differentiated from the
449,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"other Platonic ideas by precisely this attribute, that it must be"
450,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"embodied. What else is the meaning of the statement in the _Phaedrus_,"
451,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"""This is the privilege of beauty, that, being the loveliest (of the"
452,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"ideas) she is also the most palpable to sight?"" [Footnote: § 251.] Now,"
453,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"whatever one's stand on the question of nature versus humanity in art,"
454,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"one must admit that embodying ideals means, in the long run,"
455,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"personifying them. The poet, despising the sordid and unwieldy natures"
456,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"of men, may try, as Wordsworth did, to give us a purer crystallization"
457,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"of his ideas in nature, but it is really his own personality, scattered"
458,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"to the four winds, that he is offering us in the guise of nature, as the"
459,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,habiliments of his thought. Reflection leads us to agree with Coleridge:
460,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
461,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"In our life alone does nature live,"
462,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Ours is her wedding garment, ours her shrowd."
463,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: _Ode to Dejection._]
464,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
465,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"The poet may not always be conscious of this, any more than Keats was;"
466,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,his traits may be so broadcast that he is in the position of the
467,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"philosopher who, from the remote citadel of his head, disowns his own"
468,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"toes; nevertheless, a sense of tingling oneness with him is the secret"
469,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"of nature's attraction. Walt Whitman, who conceives of the poet's"
470,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"personality as the most pervasive thing in the universe, arrives at his"
471,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"conviction by the same reflection as that of Keats, telling us,"
472,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
473,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"There was a child went forth every day,"
474,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"And the first object he looked upon, that object he became."
475,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
476,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Perhaps Alice Meynell has best expressed the phenomenon, in a sonnet"
477,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,called _The Love of Narcissus:_
478,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
479,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Like him who met his own eyes in the river,"
480,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,The poet trembles at his own long gaze
481,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,That meets him through the changing nights and days
482,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,From out great Nature; all her waters quiver
483,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,With his fair image facing him forever:
484,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,The music that he listens to betrays
485,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,His own heart to his ears: by trackless ways
486,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,His wild thoughts tend to him in long endeavor.
487,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,His dreams are far among the silent hills;
488,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,His vague voice calls him from the darkened plain;
489,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,With winds at night vague recognition thrills
490,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,His lonely heart with piercing love and pain;
491,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"He knows again his mirth in mountain rills,"
492,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,His weary tears that touch him in the rain.
493,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
494,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Possibly we may concede that his fusion with all nature renders the
495,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,poet's personality so diaphanous that his presence is unobtrusive in
496,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"poetry of ideas, but we may still object to his thrusting himself into"
497,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"realistic poetry. Shelley's poet-heroes we will tolerate, as translucent"
498,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"mediums of his thought, but we are not inclined to accept Byron's, when"
499,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,we seek a panoramic view of this world. Poetry gains manifold
500,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"representation of life, we argue, in proportion as the author represses"
501,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"his personal bias, and approximates the objective view that a scientist"
502,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,gives. We cannot but sympathize with Sidney Lanier's complaint against
503,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"""your cold jellyfish poets that wrinkle themselves about a pebble of a"
504,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"theme and let us see it through their substance, as if that were a great"
505,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"feat."" [Footnote: _Poem Outlines._]"
506,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
507,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"In answer, champions of the ubiquitous poet in recent realistic verse"
508,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"may point to the _Canterbury Tales,_ and show us Chaucer ambling"
509,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"along with the other pilgrims. His presence, they remind us, instead of"
510,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"distorting his picture of fourteenth-century life, lends intimacy to our"
511,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"view of it. We can only feebly retort that, despite his girth, the poet"
512,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"is the least conspicuous figure in that procession, whereas a modern"
513,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"poet would shoulder himself ahead of the knight, steal the hearts of all"
514,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"the ladies, from Madame Eglantine to the Wife of Bath, and change the"
515,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,destinies of each of his rivals ere Canterbury was reached.
516,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
517,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,We return to our strongest argument for the invisible poet. What of
518,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Shakespeare? we reiterate. Well, the poets might remind us that"
519,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,criticism of late years has been laying more and more stress upon the
520,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"personality of Shakespeare, in the spirit of Hartley Coleridge's lines,"
521,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
522,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Great poet, 'twas thy art,"
523,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"To know thyself, and in thyself to be"
524,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Whate'er love, hate, ambition, destiny,"
525,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Or the firm, fatal purpose of the heart"
526,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Can make of man.
527,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: _Shakespeare_.]
528,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
529,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"If this trend of criticism is in the right direction, then the apparent"
530,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"objectivity of the poet must be pure camouflage, and it is his own"
531,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"personality that he is giving us all the time, in the guise of one"
532,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"character and another. In this case, not his frank confession of his"
533,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"presence in his poetry, but his self-concealment, falsifies his"
534,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,representation of life. Since we have quoted Browning's apparent
535,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"criticism of the self-revealing poet, it is only fair to quote some of"
536,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,his unquestionably sincere utterances on the other side of the question.
537,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"""You speak out, you,"" he wrote to Elizabeth Barrett; [Footnote: January"
538,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"13, 1845.] ""I only make men and women speak--give you truth broken into"
539,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"prismatic hues, and fear the pure white light."" Again he wrote, ""I never"
540,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"have begun, even, what I hope I was born to begin and end,--'R.B.', a"
541,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"poem."" [Footnote: Letter to Elizabeth Barrett, February 3, 1845.] And"
542,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Mrs. Browning, usually a better spokesman for the typical English poet"
543,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"than is Browning himself, likewise conceives it the artist's duty to"
544,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"show us his own nature, to be ""greatly _himself always_, which is"
545,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"the hardest thing for a man to be, perhaps."" [Footnote: Letter to Robert"
546,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Browning, September 9, 1845.]"
547,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
548,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"""Art,"" says Aristotle, ""is an imitation of life."" ""_L'art, mes"
549,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"enfants_,"" says the modern poet, speaking through the lips of"
550,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Verlaine, ""_c'est d'être absolument soi-même_."" Of course if one"
551,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"concedes that the poet is the only thing in life worth bothering about,"
552,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,the two statements become practically identical. It may be true that the
553,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,poet's universal sympathies make him the most complex type that
554,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"civilization has produced, and consequently the most economical figure"
555,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,to present as a sample of humanity. But Taine has offered us a simpler
556,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"way of harmonizing the two statements, not by juggling with Aristotle's"
557,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"word ""life,"" but with the word ""imitation."" ""Art,"" says Taine, ""is"
558,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"nature seen through a temperament."""
559,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
560,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Now it may be that to Aristotle imitation, _Mimeseis_, did mean ""seeing"
561,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"through a temperament."" But certainly, had he used that phrase, he would"
562,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"have laid the stress on ""seeing,"" rather than on ""temperament."""
563,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Aristotle would judge a man to have poetic temperament if his mind were
564,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"like a telescope, sharpening the essential outlines of things. Modern"
565,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"poets, on the other hand, are inclined to grant that a person has poetic"
566,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"temperament only if his mind resembles a jeweled window, transforming"
567,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"all that is seen through it, if by any chance something _is_ seen"
568,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,through it.
569,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
570,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,If the modern poet sees the world colored red or green or violet by his
571,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"personality, it is well for the interests of truth, we must admit, that"
572,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"he make it clear to us that his nature is the transforming medium, but"
573,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,how comes it that he fixes his attention so exclusively upon the colors
574,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"of things, for which his own nature is responsible, and ignores the"
575,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"forms of things, which are not affected by him? How comes it that the"
576,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,colored lights thrown on nature by the stained windows of his soul are
577,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"so important to him that he feels justified in painting for us,"
578,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"notnature, but stained-glass windows?"
579,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
580,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"In part this is, as has often been said, a result of the individualizing"
581,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,trend of modern art. The broad general outlines of things have been
582,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"""done"" by earlier artists, and there is no chance for later artists to"
583,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"vary them, but the play of light and shade offers infinite possibilities"
584,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,of variation. If one poet shows us the world highly colored by his
585,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"personality, it is inevitable that his followers should have their"
586,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,attention caught by the different coloring which their own natures throw
587,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"upon it. The more acute their sense of observation, the more they will"
588,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"be interested in the phenomenon. ""Of course you are self-conscious,"""
589,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Elizabeth Barrett wrote to Robert Browning. ""How could you be a poet"
590,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"otherwise?"" [Footnote: February 27, 1845.]"
591,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
592,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"This modern individualizing trend appears equally in all the arts, of"
593,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,course. Yet the poet's self-consciousness appears in his work more
594,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,plainly than does that of painters and sculptors and musicians. One
595,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,wonders if this may not be a consequence of the peculiar nature of his
596,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,inspiration. While all art is doubtless essentially alike in mode of
597,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"creation, it may not be fanciful to conceive that the poet's inspiration"
598,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"is surrounded by deeper mystery than that of other geniuses, and that"
599,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,this accounts for the greater prominence of conscious self-analysis in
600,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"his work. That such a difference exists, seems obvious. In spite of the"
601,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"lengths to which program music has been carried, we have, so far as I"
602,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"know, practically no music, outside of opera, that claims to have the"
603,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"musician, or the artist in general, for its theme. So sweeping an"
604,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"assertion cannot be made regarding painting and sculpture, to be sure."
605,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Near the beginning of the history of sculpture we are met by the legend
606,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"of Phidias placing his own image among the gods. At the other extreme,"
607,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"chronologically, we are familiar with Daniel Chester French's group,"
608,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Death Staying the Hand of the Sculptor. Painters not infrequently
609,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,portray themselves and their artist friends. Yet it is improbable that
610,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,the mass of material concerned with the poet's view of the artist can be
611,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"paralleled. This is due in part, obviously, to the greater plasticity to"
612,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"ideas of his medium, but may it not be due also to the fact that all"
613,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"other arts demand an apprenticeship, during which the technique is"
614,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"mastered in a rational, comprehensible way? Whereas the poet is apt to"
615,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"forget that he has a technique at all, since he shares his tool,"
616,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"language, with men of all callings whatever. He feels himself,"
617,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"accordingly, to be dependent altogether upon a mysterious ""visitation"""
618,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,for his inspiration.
619,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
620,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,At least this mystery surrounding his creations has much to do with
621,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,removing the artist from the comparative freedom from self-consciousness
622,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,that we ascribe to the general run of men. In addition it removes him
623,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"from the comparative humility of other thinkers, who are wont to think"
624,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"of their discoveries as following inevitably upon their data, so that"
625,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,they themselves deserve credit only as they are persistent and
626,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,painstaking in following the clues. The genesis of Sir Isaac Newton's
627,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,discovery has been compared to poetical inspiration; yet even in this
628,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"case the difference is apparent, and Newton did not identify himself"
629,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"with the universe he conceived, as the poet is in the habit of doing."
630,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
631,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Not being able to account for his inspirations, the poet seems to be"
632,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"driven inevitably either into excessive humility, since he feels that"
633,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"his words are not his own, or into inordinate pride, since he feels that"
634,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,he is able to see and express without volition truths that other men
635,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,cannot glimpse with the utmost effort. He may disclaim all credit for
636,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"his performance, in the words of a nineteenth-century verse-writer:"
637,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
638,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,This is the end of the book
639,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Written by God.
640,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"I am the earth he took,"

643,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,With his sounding rod.
644,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"[Footnote: L. E. Mitchell, _Written at the End of a Book._]"
645,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
646,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,a statement that provokes wonder as to God's sensations at having such
647,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,amateurish works come out under his name. But this sort of humility is
648,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"really a protean manifestation of egotism, as is clear in the religious"
649,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,states that bear resemblance to the poet's. This the Methodist
650,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"""experience meeting"" abundantly illustrates, where endless loquacity is"
651,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"considered justifiable, because the glory of one's experience is due,"
652,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"not to one's self, but to the Almighty."
653,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
654,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,The minor American poets in the middle of the last century are often
655,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"found exhorting one another to humility, quite after the prayer-meeting"

703,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Win in each heart and memory a home.
704,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"[Footnote: C. Augustus Price, _Dedication._]"
705,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
706,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,But among writers whose names are recognizable without an appeal to a
707,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"librarian's index, precisely this attitude is not met with. It would be"
708,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"absurd, of course, to deny that one finds convincingly sincere"
709,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,expressions of modesty among poets of genuine merit. Many of them have
710,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,taken pains to express themselves in their verse as humbled by the
711,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"genius above their grasp. [Footnote: See Emerson, _In a Dull Uncertain"
712,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Brain_; Whittier, _To my Namesake_; Sidney Lanier, _Ark of the Future_;"
713,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Oliver Wendell Holmes, _The Last Reader_; Bayard Taylor, _L'Envoi_;"
714,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Robert Louis Stevenson, _To Dr. Hake_; Francis Thompson, _To My"
715,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Godchild_.] But we must agree with their candid avowals that they belong
716,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,in the second rank. The greatest poets of the century are not in the
717,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,habit of belittling themselves. It is almost unparalleled to find so
718,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,sweeping a revolutionist of poetic traditions as Burns saying of
719,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,himself:
720,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
721,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"I am nae poet, in a sense,"
722,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"But just a rhymer like, by chance,"
723,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"And hae to learning nae pretense,"
724,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Yet what the matter?
725,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Whene'er my muse does on me glance,"
726,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,I jingle at her.
727,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: _Epistle to Lapraik._]
728,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
729,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Most of the self-depreciatory writers, by their very abnegation of the"
730,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"title, exalt the supreme poet. There are few indeed so unconcerned about"
731,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"the dignity of the calling as is Sir Walter Scott, who assigns to the"
732,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,minstrels of his tales a subordinate social position that would make the
733,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"average bard depicted in literature gnash his teeth for rage, and who"
734,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,casually disposes of the poet's immortality:
735,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
736,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Let but the verse befit a hero's fame;
737,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Immortal be the verse, forgot the author's name."
738,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: _Introduction to Don Roderick._]
739,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
740,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Mrs. Browning, to be sure, also tries to prick the bubble of the poet's"
741,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"conceit, assuring him:"

743,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Ye are not great because creation drew
744,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Large revelations round your earliest sense,"

746,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: _Mountaineer and Poet_.]
747,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
748,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"But in her other poetry, notably in _Aurora Leigh_ and _A Vision of"
749,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Poets,_ she amply avows her sense of the preëminence of the singer, as"
750,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,well as of his song.
751,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
752,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,While it is easy to shake our heads over the self-importance of the
753,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"nineteenth century, and to contrast it with the unconscious lyrical"
754,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"spontaneity of half-mythical singers in the beginning of the world, it"
755,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,is probable that some degree of egotism is essential to a poet.
756,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Remembering his statement that his name was written in water, we are"
757,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"likely to think of Keats as the humblest of geniuses, yet he wrote to a"
758,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"friend, ""You will observe at the end of this, 'How a solitary life"
759,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,engenders pride and egotism!' True--I know it does: but this pride and
760,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"egotism will enable me to write finer things than anything else could,"
761,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"so I will indulge it."" [Footnote: Letter to John Taylor, August 23,"
762,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,1819.] No matter how modest one may be about his work after it is
763,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"completed, a sense of its worth must be with one at the time of"
764,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"composition, else he will not go to the trouble of recording and"
765,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,preserving it.
766,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
767,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Unless the writer schools himself to keep this conviction out of his
768,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"verse, it is likely to flower in self-confident poetry of the classic"
769,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"type, so characteristic of the Elizabethan age. This has such a long"
770,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"tradition behind it that it seems almost stereotyped, wherever it"
771,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"appears in our period, especially when it is promising immortality to a"
772,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"beloved one. We scarcely heed such verses as the lines by Landor,"

781,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"And find Ianthe's name again,"
782,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
783,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"or Francis Thompson's sonnet sequence, _Ad Amicam_, which expresses"
784,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,the author's purpose to
785,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
786,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Fling a bold stave to the old bald Time,"
787,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Telling him that he is too insolent

793,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
794,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"or Yeats' lines _Of Those Who Have Spoken Evil of His Beloved_,"

799,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Their children's children shall say they have lied.
800,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
801,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,But a more vibrantly personal note breaks out from time to time in the
802,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"most original verse of the last century, as in Wordsworth's testimony,"
803,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,

815,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
816,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Nowadays, in fact, even minor poets for the most part frankly avow the"
817,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,importance of their works. We find George Edward Woodberry in the
818,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"clutches of the old-fashioned habit of apology, to be sure, [Footnote:"
819,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,See _My Country_.]--perhaps this is one reason the radicals are so
820,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,opposed to him; but in the ranks of the radicals themselves we find very
821,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,few retaining any doubt of themselves. [Footnote: Exceptions are Jessie
822,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Rittenhouse, _Patrius_; Lawrence Houseman, _Mendicant Rhymes_;"
823,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Robert Silliman Hillyer, _Poor Faltering Rhymes_.] Self-assertion"
824,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"is especially characteristic of their self-appointed leader, Ezra Pound,"
825,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"in whose case it is undoubtedly an inheritance from Walt Whitman, whom"
826,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"he has lately acknowledged as his ""pig-headed father."" [Footnote:"
827,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"_Lustra_.] A typical assertion is that in _Salutation the Second_,"
828,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
829,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"How many will come after me,"
830,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Singing as well as I sing, none better."
831,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
832,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,There is a delicate charm in the self-assurance appearing in some of the
833,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"present verse, as Sara Teasdale's confidence in her ""fragile"
834,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"immortality"" [Footnote: _Refuge._] or James Stephens' exultation in"
835,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"_A Tune Upon a Reed,_"
836,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
837,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Not a piper can succeed
838,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"When I lean against a tree,"
839,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Blowing gently on a reed,"

849,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
850,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"If one were concerned only with this ""not marble nor the gilded"
851,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"monuments"" theme, the sixteenth century would quite eclipse the"
852,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,nineteenth or twentieth. But the egoism of our writers goes much further
853,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,than this parental satisfaction in their offspring. It seems to have
854,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"needed the intense individualism of Rousseau's philosophy, and of German"
855,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"idealism, especially the conception of ""irony,"" or the superiority of"
856,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"the soul over its creations, to bring the poet's egoism to flower. Its"
857,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"rankest blossoming, in Walt Whitman, would be hard to imagine in another"
858,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,century. Try to conceive even an Elizabethan beginning a poem after the
859,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,fashion of _A Song of Myself:_
860,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
861,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"I, now thirty-seven years old, in perfect health, begin,"
862,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Hoping to cease not till death.

871,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"While our poets thus assert, occasionally, that the unblushing nudity of"
872,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"their pride is a conscious departure from convention, they would not"
873,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,have us believe that they are fundamentally different from older
874,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"singers. One seldom finds an actual poet, of whatever period, depicted"
875,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"in the verse of the last century, whose pride is not insisted upon. The"
876,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"favorite poet-heroes, Aeschylus, Michael Angelo, Tasso, Dante, Marlowe,"
877,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Shakespeare, Milton, Chatterton, Keats, Byron, are all characterized as"
878,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,proud. The last-named has been especially kept in the foreground by
879,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"following verse-writers, as a precedent for their arrogance. Shelley's"
880,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"characterization of Byron in _Julian and Maddalo_,"
881,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
882,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,The sense that he was greater than his kind

886,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"has been followed by many expressions of the same thought, at first"
887,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"wholly sympathetic, lately, it must be confessed, somewhat ironical."
888,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
889,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Consciousness of partnership with God in composition naturally lifts the
890,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"poet, in his own estimation, at least, to a super-human level. The myth"
891,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,of Apollo disguised as a shepherd strikes him as being a happy
892,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"expression of his divinity. [Footnote: See James Russell Lowell, _The"

954,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
955,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"No!--still too proud to be vindictive, I"

958,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"It is clear that his creations are the origin of the poet's pride, yet,"
959,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"singularly enough, his arrogance sometimes reaches such proportions that"
960,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,he grows ashamed of his art as unworthy of him. Of course this attitude
961,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,harks back to Shakespeare's sonnets. The humiliation which Shakespeare
962,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,endured because his calling was despised by his aristocratic young
963,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"friend is largely the theme of a poem, _Ben Jonson Entertains a Man"

1000,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"And know we be its rulers, though but dreams."
1001,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: _Revolt Against the Crepuscular Spirit in Modern Poetry_.]
1002,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1003,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Perhaps, indeed, judging from contemporary tendencies, this study is"
1004,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,made too early to reflect the poet's egoism at its full tide.
1005,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1006,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,The poet's overweening self-esteem may well be the hothouse atmosphere
1007,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"in which alone his genius can thrive, but from another point of view it"
1008,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"seems a subtle poison gas, engendering all the ills that differentiate"
1009,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,him from other men. Its first effect is likely to be the reflection that
1010,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,his genius is judged by a public that is vastly inferior to him. This
1011,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,galling thought usually drives him into an attitude of indifference or
1012,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,of openly expressed contempt for his audience. The mood is apparent at
1013,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,the very beginning of the romantic period. The germ of such a feeling is
1014,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"to be found even in so modest a poet as Cowper, who maintains that his"
1015,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"brother poets, rather than the unliterary public, should pass upon his"
1016,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,worth.[Footnote: See _To Darwin_.] But the average poet of the last
1017,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"century and a half goes a step beyond this attitude, and appears to feel"
1018,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,that there is something contemptible about popularity. Literary
1019,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"arrogance seems far from characteristic of Burns, yet he tells us how,"
1020,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"in a mood of discouragement,"
1021,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1022,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"I backward mused on wasted time,"
1023,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"How I had spent my youthful prime,"
1024,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,And done naething
1025,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,But stringin' blithers up in rhyme
1026,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,For fools to sing.
1027,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: _The Vision._]
1028,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1029,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Of course it is not till we come to Byron that we meet the most
1030,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,thoroughgoing expression of this contempt for the public. The sentiment
1031,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,in _Childe Harold_ is one that Byron never tires of harping on:
1032,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"I have not loved the world, nor the world me;"
1033,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"I have not flattered its rank breath, nor bowed"
1034,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,To its idolatries a patient knee.
1035,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1036,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"And this attitude of Byron's has been adopted by all his disciples, who"
1037,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,delight in picturing his scorn:
1038,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1039,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"With terror now he froze the cowering blood,"
1040,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"And now dissolved the heart in tenderness,"
1041,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Yet would not tremble, would not weep, himself,"
1042,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"But back into his soul retired alone,"
1043,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Dark, sullen, proud, gazing contemptuously"
1044,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,On hearts and passions prostrate at his feet.
1045,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"[Footnote: Robert Pollock, _The Course of Time._]"
1046,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1047,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Of the other romantic poets, Sir Walter Scott alone remains on good"
1048,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"terms with the public, expressing a child's surprise and delight over"
1049,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,the substantial checks he is given in exchange for his imaginings. But
1050,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Shelley starts out with a chip on his shoulder, in the very"
1051,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,advertisements of his poems expressing his unflattering opinion of
1052,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"The public's judgment, and Keats makes it plain that his own criticisms"
1053,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,concern him far more than those of other men.
1054,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1055,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"The consciously aristocratic, sniffing attitude toward the public, which"
1056,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"ran its course during Victoria's reign, is ushered in by Landor, who"
1057,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"confesses,"
1058,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1059,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"I know not whether I am proud,"
1060,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"But this I know, I hate the crowd,"
1061,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Therefore pray let me disengage
1062,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"My verses from the motley page,"
1063,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Where others, far more sure to please"
1064,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Pour forth their choral song with ease.
1065,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1066,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,The same gentlemanly indifference to his plebeian readers is diffused
1067,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"all through Matthew Arnold's writing, of course. He casually disposes of"
1068,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,popularity:
1069,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1070,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Some secrets may the poet tell
1071,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,For the world loves new ways;
1072,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"To tell too deep ones is not well,--"
1073,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,It knows not what he says.
1074,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: See _In Memory of Obermann._]
1075,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1076,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Mrs. Browning probably has her own success in mind when she makes the
1077,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"young poetess, Aurora Leigh, recoil from the fulsome praise of her"
1078,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"readers. Browning takes the same attitude in _Sordello,_ contrasting"
1079,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Eglamor, the versifier who servilely conformed to the taste of the mob,"
1080,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"with Sordello, the true poet, who despised it. In _Popularity_, Browning"
1081,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"returns to the same theme, of the public's misplaced praises, and in"
1082,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,_Pacchiarotto_ he outdoes himself in heaping ridicule upon his readers.
1083,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Naturally the coterie of later poets who have prided themselves on their
1084,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,unique skill in interpreting Browning have been impressed by his
1085,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,contempt for his readers. Perhaps they have even exaggerated it. No less
1086,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"contemptuous of his readers than Browning was that other Victorian, so"
1087,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"like him in many respects, George Meredith."
1088,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1089,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,It would be interesting to make a list of the zoological metaphors by
1090,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,which the Victorians expressed their contempt for the public. Landor
1091,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"characterized their criticisms as ""asses' kicks aimed at his head."""
1092,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"[Footnote: Edmund Gosse, _Life of Swinburne_, p. 103.] Browning"
1093,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,alternately represented his public cackling and barking at him.
1094,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"[Footnote: See Thomas J. Wise, Letters, Second Series, Vol. 2, p. 52.]"
1095,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"George Meredith made a dichotomy of his readers into ""summer flies"" and"
1096,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"""swinish grunters."" [Footnote: _My Theme_.] Tennyson, being no"
1097,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"naturalist, simply named the public the ""many-headed beast."" [Footnote:"
1098,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,_In Memoriam_.]
1099,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1100,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,In America there has been less of this sort of thing openly expressed by
1101,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"genuine poets. Emerson is fairly outspoken, telling us, in _The"
1102,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Poet_, how the public gapes and jeers at a new vision. But one must"
1103,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,go to our border-line poets to find the feeling most candidly put into
1104,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"words. Most of them spurn popularity, asserting that they are too"
1105,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,worthwhile to be appreciated. They may be even nauseated by the slight
1106,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"success they manage to achieve, and exclaim,"
1107,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1108,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Yet to know
1109,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,That we create an Eden for base worms!
1110,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1111,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,If the consciousness of recent writers is dominated by contempt for
1112,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"mankind at large, such a mood is expressed with more caution than"
1113,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,formerly. Kipling takes men's stupidity philosophically. [Footnote: See
1114,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,_The Story of Ung._] Edgar Lee Masters uses a fictional character
1115,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,as a mask for his remarks on the subject. [Footnote: See _Having His
1116,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Way._] Other poets have expressed themselves with a degree of mildness.
1117,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"[Footnote: See Watts-Dunton, _Apollo in Paris;_ James Stephens, _The"
1118,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Market;_ Henry Newbolt, _An Essay in Criticism;_ William Rose Benét,"
1119,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,_People._] But of course Ezra Pound is not to be suppressed. He
1120,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"inquires,"
1121,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1122,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Will people accept them?
1123,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"(i.e., these songs)"
1124,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,As a timorous wench from a centaur
1125,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,(or a centurion)
1126,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Already they flee, howling in terror"
1127,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,*       *       *       *       *
1128,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Will they be touched with the verisimilitude?
1129,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Their virgin stupidity is untemptable.
1130,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1131,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"He adds,"
1132,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1133,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"I beg you, my friendly critics,"
1134,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Do not set about to procure me an audience.
1135,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1136,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Again he instructs his poems, when they meet the public,"
1137,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1138,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Salute them with your thumbs to your noses.
1139,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1140,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"It is very curious, after such passages, to find him pleading, in"
1141,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"another poem,"
1142,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1143,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,May my poems be printed this week?
1144,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1145,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,The naïveté of this last question brings up insistently a perplexing
1146,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"problem. If the poet despises his readers, why does he write? He may"
1147,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"perhaps evade this question by protesting, with Tennyson,"
1148,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1149,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"I pipe but as the linnets do,"
1150,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,And sing because I must.
1151,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1152,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"But why does he publish? If he were strictly logical, surely he would do"
1153,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"as the artist in Browning's _Pictor Ignotus,_ who so shrank from"
1154,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"having his pictures come into contact with fools, that he painted upon"
1155,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"hidden, moldering walls, thus renouncing all possibility of fame. But"
1156,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"one doubts whether such renunciation has been made often, especially in"
1157,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"the field of poetry. Rossetti buried his poems, of course, but their"
1158,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,resurrection was not postponed till the Last Judgment. Other writers
1159,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"have coyly waved fame away, but have gracefully yielded to their"
1160,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"friends' importunities, and have given their works to the world. When"
1161,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,one reads such expressions as Byron's;
1162,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1163,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Fame is the thirst of youth,--but I am not"
1164,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,So young as to regard men's frown or smile
1165,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"As loss or guerdon of a glorious lot,"
1166,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: _Childe Harold._]
1167,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1168,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,one wonders. Perhaps the highest genius takes absolutely no account of
1169,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"fame, as the sun-god asserts in Watts-Dunton's poem, _Apollo in Paris:_"
1170,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1171,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"I love the song-born poet, for that he"
1172,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Loves only song--seeks for love's sake alone
1173,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Shy Poesie, whose dearest bowers, unknown"
1174,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"To feudaries of fame, are known to thee."
1175,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"[Footnote: See also Coventry Patmore, from _The Angel in the House,_ ""I"
1176,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"will not Hearken Blame or Praise""; Francis Carlin, _The Home Song_"
1177,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,(1918).]
1178,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1179,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"But other poets, with the utmost inconsistency, have admitted that they"
1180,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"find the thought of fame very sweet. [Footnote: See Edward Young, _Love"
1181,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"of Fame;_ John Clare, _Song's Eternity, Idle Fame, To John Milton;_"
1182,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Bulwer Lytton, _The Desire of Fame;_ James Gates Percival, _Sonnet 379;_"
1183,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Josephine Peston Peabody, _Marlowe._] Keats dwells upon the thought of"
1184,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,it. [Footnote: See the _Epistle to My Brother George._] Browning shows
1185,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,both of his poet heroes concerned over the question. In _Pauline_ the
1186,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"speaker confesses,"
1187,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1188,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,I ne'er sing
1189,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"But as one entering bright halls, where all"
1190,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Will rise and shout for him.
1191,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1192,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"In _Sordello,_ again, Browning analyzes the desire for fame:"
1193,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1194,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Souls like Sordello, on the contrary,"
1195,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Coerced and put to shame, retaining will,"
1196,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Care little, take mysterious comfort still,"
1197,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,But look forth tremblingly to ascertain
1198,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"If others judge their claims not urged in vain,"
1199,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,And say for them their stifled thoughts aloud.
1200,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,So they must ever live before a crowd:
1201,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"--""Vanity,"" Naddo tells you."
1202,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1203,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Emerson's Saadi is one who does not despise fame,"
1204,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Nor can dispense
1205,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,With Persia for an audience.
1206,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: _Saadi._]
1207,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1208,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Can it be that when the poet renounces fame, we must concur with Austin"
1209,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Dobson's paraphrase of his meaning,"
1210,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1211,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"But most, because the grapes are sour,"
1212,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Farewell, renown?"
1213,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: _Farewell Renown._]
1214,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1215,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Perhaps the poet is saved from inconsistency by his touching confidence
1216,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,that in other times and places human nature is less stupid and
1217,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,unappreciative than it proves itself in his immediate audience. He
1218,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,reasons that in times past the public has shown sufficient insight to
1219,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"establish the reputation of the master poets, and that history will"
1220,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,repeat itself. Several writers have stated explicitly that their quarrel
1221,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,with humanity is not to be carried beyond the present generation. Thus
1222,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Arnold objects to his time because it is aesthetically dead. [Footnote:
1223,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,See _Persistency of Poetry._] But elsewhere he objects because it shows
1224,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"signs of coming to life, [Footnote: See _Bacchanalia._] so it is hard to"
1225,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,determine how our grandfathers could have pleased him. Similarly
1226,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,unreasonable discontent has been expressed by later poets with our own
1227,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"time. [Footnote: See William Ernest Henley, _The Gods are Dead;_ Edmund"
1228,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Gosse, _On Certain Critics;_ Samuel Waddington, _The Death of Song;_"
1229,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"John Payne, _Double Ballad of the Singers of the Time_(1906).] Only"
1230,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,occasionally a poet rebukes his brethren for this carping attitude. Mrs.
1231,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Browning protests, in _Aurora Leigh,_"
1232,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1233,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,'Tis ever thus
1234,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"With times we live in,--evermore too great"
1235,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,To be apprehended near....
1236,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,I do distrust the poet who discerns
1237,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"No character or glory in his times,"
1238,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,And trundles back his soul five hundred years.
1239,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"[Footnote: See Robert Browning, Letter to Elizabeth Barrett, March 12,"
1240,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,1845.]
1241,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1242,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"And Kipling is a notorious defender of the present generation, but these"
1243,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"two stand almost alone. [Footnote: See also James Elroy Flecker, _Oak"
1244,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"and Olive;_ Max Ehrmann, _Give Me Today._]"
1245,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1246,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Several mythical explanations for the stupidity of the poet's own times
1247,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,have been offered in verse. Browning says that poetry is like wine; it
1248,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,must age before it grows sweet. [Footnote: _Epilogue to the Pacchiarotto
1249,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Volume._] Emerson says the poet's generation is deafened by the thunder
1250,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,of his voice. [Footnote: _Solution._] A minor writer says that poetry
1251,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"must be written in one's life-blood, so that it necessarily kills one"
1252,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"before it is appreciated. [Footnote: William Reed Dunroy, _The Way of"
1253,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,the World_ (1897).] Another suggests that a subtle electric change is
1254,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"worked in one's poems by death. [Footnote: Richard Gilder, _A Poet's"
1255,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Question._] But the only reasonable explanation of the failure of the
1256,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,poet's own generation to appreciate him seems to be that offered by
1257,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Shelley, in the _Defense of Poetry:_"
1258,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1259,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,No living poet ever arrived at the fullness of his fame; the
1260,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"jury which sits in judgment upon a poet, belonging as he does to"
1261,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"all time, must be composed of his peers."
1262,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1263,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Of course the contempt of the average poet for his contemporaries is not
1264,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,the sort of thing to endear him to them. Their self-respect almost
1265,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"forces them to ignore the poet's talents. And unfortunately, in addition"
1266,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"to taking a top-lofty attitude, the poet has, until recently, gone much"
1267,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"farther, and while despising the public has tried to improve it. Most"
1268,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"nineteenth century poetry might be described in Mrs. Browning's words,"
1269,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,as
1270,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1271,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Antidotes
1272,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Of medicated music, answering for"
1273,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Mankind's forlornest uses.
1274,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: _Sonnets from the Portuguese._]
1275,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1276,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,And like an unruly child the public struggled against the dose.
1277,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Whereupon the poet was likely to lose his temper, and declare, as"
1278,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Browning did,"
1279,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1280,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"My Thirty-four Port, no need to waste"
1281,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"On a tongue that's fur, and a palate--paste!"
1282,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,A magnum for friends who are sound: the sick--
1283,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"I'll posset and cosset them, nothing loath,"
1284,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Henceforward with nettle-broth.
1285,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: _Epilogue to the Pacchiarotto Volume._]
1286,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1287,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Yes, much as we pity the forlorn poet when his sensitive feelings are"
1288,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"hurt by the world's cruelty, we must still pronounce that he is partly"
1289,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,to blame. If the public is buzzing around his head like a swarm of angry
1290,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"hornets, he must in most cases admit that he has stirred them up with a"
1291,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,stick.
1292,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1293,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,The poet's vilified contemporaries employ various means of retaliating.
1294,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"They may invite him to dinner, then point out that His Omniscience does"
1295,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"not know how to manage a fork, or they may investigate his family tree,"
1296,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"and then cut his acquaintance, or, most often, they may listen to his"
1297,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"fanciful accounts of reality, then brand him as a liar. So the vicious"
1298,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"circle is completed, for the poet is harassed by this treatment into the"
1299,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"belief that he is the target for organized persecution, and as a result"
1300,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"his egotism grows more and more morbid, and his contempt for the public"
1301,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,more deliberately expressed.
1302,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1303,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,At the beginning of the period under discussion the social snubs seem to
1304,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,have rankled most in the poet's nature. This was doubtless a survival
1305,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,from the times of patronage. James Thomson [Footnote: See the _Castle
1306,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"of Indolence,_ Canto II, stanzas XXI-III. See also _To Mr. Thomson,"
1307,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Doubtful to What Patron to Address the Poem,_ by H. Hill.] and Thomas"
1308,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Hood [Footnote: See _To the Late Lord Mayor._] both concerned
1309,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,themselves with the problem. Kirke White appears to have felt that
1310,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,patronage of poets was still a live issue. [Footnote: See the _Ode
1311,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Addressed to the Earle of Carlisle._] Crabbe, in a narrative poem,"
1312,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,offered a pathetic picture of a young poet dying of heartbreak because
1313,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"of the malicious cruelty of the aristocracy toward him, a farmer's son."
1314,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: _The Patron._] Later on Mrs. Browning took up the cudgels for
1315,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"the poet, in _Lady Geraldine's Courtship,_ and upheld the nobility of"
1316,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"the untitled poet almost too strenuously, for his morbid pride makes him"
1317,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,appear by all odds the worst snob in the poem. The less dignified
1318,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,contingent of the public annoys the poet by burlesquing the grandiose
1319,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,manners and poses to which his large nature easily lends itself. People
1320,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,are likely to question the poet's powers of soul because he forgets to
1321,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"cut his hair, or to fasten his blouse at the throat. And of course there"
1322,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"have been rhymsters who have gone over to the side of the enemy, and who"
1323,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"have made profit from exhibiting their freakishness, after the manner of"
1324,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,circus monstrosities. Thomas Moore sometimes takes malicious pleasure in
1325,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,thus showing up the oddities of his race. [See _Common Sense and
1326,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Genius,_ and _Rhymes by the Road._] Later libelers have been, usually,"
1327,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,writers of no reputation. The literary squib that made most stir in the
1328,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"course of the century was not a poem, but the novel, _The Green"
1329,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Carnation,_ which poked fun at the mannerisms of the 1890 poets."
1330,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: Gilbert and Sullivan's _Patience_ made an even greater
1331,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"sensation.] Oddly, American poets betray more indignation than English"
1332,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"ones over such lampoons. Longfellow makes Michael Angelo exclaim,"
1333,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1334,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,I say an artist
1335,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Who does not wholly give himself to art,"
1336,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Who has about him nothing marked or strange,"

1339,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: _Michael Angelo._]
1340,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1341,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Sometimes an American poet takes the opposite tack, and denies that his"
1342,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,conduct differs from that of other men. Thus Richard Watson Gilder
1343,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"insists that the poet has ""manners like other men"" and that on"
1344,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,thisaccount the world that is eagerly awaiting the future poet will miss
1345,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,him. He repeats the world's query:
1346,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1347,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,How shall we know him?
1348,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Ye shall know him not,"
1349,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Till, ended hate and scorn,"

1352,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1353,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Whitman, in his defense, goes farther than this, and takes an original"
1354,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"attitude toward his failure to keep step with other men, declaring"
1355,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1356,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Of these states the poet is the equable man,"
1357,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Not in him but off him things are grotesque, eccentric,"

1361,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,As for the third method employed by the public in its attacks upon the
1362,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"poet,--that of making charges against his truthfulness,--the poet"
1363,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"resents this most bitterly of all. Gray, in _The Bard,_ lays the"
1364,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"wholesale slaughter of Scotch poets by Edward I, to their fearless truth"
1365,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,telling. A number of later poets have written pathetic tales showing the
1366,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,tragic results of the unimaginative public's denial of the poet's
1367,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"delicate perceptions of truth. [Footnote: See Jean Ingelow, _Gladys"

1369,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Holland, _Jacob Hurd's Child._]"
1370,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1371,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"To the poet's excited imagination, it seems as if all the world regarded"
1372,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"his race as a constantly increasing swarm of flies, and had started in"
1373,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"on a systematic course of extirpation. [Footnote: See G. K. Chesterton,"
1374,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"_More Poets Yet._] As for the professional critic, he becomes an"
1375,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"ogre, conceived of as eating a poet for breakfast every morning. The new"
1376,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,singer is invariably warned by his brothers that he must struggle for
1377,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,his honor and his very life against his malicious audience. It is
1378,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,doubtful if we could find a poet of consequence in the whole period who
1379,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,does not somewhere characterize men of his profession as the martyrs of
1380,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,beauty. [Footnote: Examples of abstract discussions of this sort are:

1391,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Woodman and the Nightingale_ expresses through an allegory the murderous
1392,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,designs of the public.
1393,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1394,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"A salient example of more vicarious indignation is Mrs. Browning, who"
1395,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,exposes the world's heartlessness in a poem called _The Seraph and the
1396,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Poet._ In _A Vision of Poets_ she betrays less indignation, apparently"
1397,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,believing that experience of undeserved suffering is essential to the
1398,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,maturing of genius. In this poem the world's greatest poets are
1399,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,described:
1400,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1401,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Where the heart of each should beat,"
1402,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"There seemed a wound instead of it,"
1403,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,From whence the blood dropped to their feet.
1404,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1405,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"The young hero of the poem, to whom the vision is given, naturally"
1406,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"shrinks from the thought of such suffering, but the attendant spirit"
1407,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"leads him on, nevertheless, to a loathsome pool, where there are bitter"
1408,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"waters,"
1409,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1410,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"And toads seen crawling on his hand,"
1411,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"And clinging bats, but dimly scanned,"
1412,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Full in his face their wings expand.
1413,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,A paleness took the poet's cheek;
1414,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"""Must I drink here?"" He seemed to seek"
1415,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,The lady's will with utterance meek:
1416,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"""Ay, ay,"" she said, ""it so must be:"""
1417,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,(And this time she spoke cheerfully)
1418,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Behooves thee know world's cruelty.
1419,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1420,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,The modern poet is able to bring forward many historical names by which

1427,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"[Footnote: _Adonais._ See also Robert Bridges, _Nero._] Of the great"
1428,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"renaissance poets, Shakespeare alone has usually been considered exempt"
1429,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"from the general persecution, though Richard Garnett humorously"
1430,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"represents even him as suffering triple punishment,--flogging,"
1431,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"imprisonment and exile,--for his offense against Sir Thomas Lucy,"
1432,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"aggravated by poetical temperament. [Footnote: See _Wm. Shakespeare,"
1433,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Pedagogue and Poacher_, a drama (1904).] Of all renaissance poets Dante"

1439,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,several French poets are commented upon in English verse. Swinburne's

1441,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Lang's _Gerard de Nerval_ come to mind.]
1442,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1443,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Naturally the adversities which touch our writers most nearly are those
1444,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,of the modern English poets. It is the poets of the romantic movement
1445,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,who are thought of as suffering greatest injustice. Chatterton's extreme
1446,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,youth probably has helped to incense many against the cruelty that
1447,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"caused his death. [Footnote: See Shelley, _Adonais_; Coleridge, _Monody"
1448,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"on the Death of Chatterton_; Keats, _Sonnet on Chatterton_; James"
1449,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Montgomery, _Stanzas on Chatterton_; Rossetti, _Sonnet to Chatterton_;"

1451,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Chatterton_; W. A. Percy, _To Chatterton_.] Southey is singled out by"
1452,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Landor for especial commiseration; _Who Smites the Wounded_ is an
1453,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,indignant uncovering of the world's cruelty in exaggerating Southey's
1454,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,faults. Landor insinuates that this persecution is extended to all
1455,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,geniuses:
1456,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1457,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Alas! what snows are shed
1458,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Upon thy laurelled head,"
1459,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Hurtled by many cares and many wrongs!
1460,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Malignity lets none
1461,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Approach the Delphic throne;
1462,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,A hundred lane-fed curs bark down Fame's
1463,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,hundred tongues.
1464,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"[Footnote: _To Southey_, _1833_.]"
1465,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1466,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,The ill-treatment of Burns has had its measure of denunciation. The
1467,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,centenary of his birth brought forth a good deal of such verse.
1468,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1469,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Of course Byron's sufferings have had their share of attention, though,"
1470,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"remembering his enormous popularity, the better poets have left to the"
1471,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"more gullible rhymsters the echo of his tirades against persecution,"
1472,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"[Footnote: See T. H. Chivers, _Lord Byron's Dying Words to Ada_, and"
1473,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"_Byron_ (1853); Charles Soran, _Byron_ (1842); E. F. Hoffman, _Byron_"
1474,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,(1849).] and have conceived of the public as beaten at its own game by
1475,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"him. Thus Shelley exults in the thought,"
1476,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1477,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,The Pythian of the age one arrow drew
1478,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"And smiled. The spoilers tempt no second blow,"
1479,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,They fawn on the proud feet that laid them low.
1480,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: _Adonais._]
1481,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1482,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"The wrongs of Keats, also, are not so much stressed in genuine poetry as"
1483,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"formerly, and the fiction that his death was due to the hostility of his"
1484,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"critics is dying out, though Shelley's _Adonais_ will go far toward"
1485,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"giving it immortality. Oscar Wilde's characterization of Keats as ""the"
1486,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"youngest of the martyrs"" [Footnote: _At the Grave of Keats._]"
1487,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"brings the tradition down almost to the present in British verse, but"
1488,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,for the most part its popularity is now limited to American rhymes. One
1489,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"is rather indignant, after reading Keats' own manly words about hostile"
1490,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"criticism, to find a nondescript verse-writer putting the puerile"
1491,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,self-characterization into his mouth:
1492,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1493,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"I, the Boy-poet, whom with curse"
1494,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,They hounded on to death's untimely doom.
1495,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"[Footnote: T. L. Harris, _Lyrics of the Golden Age_ (1856).]"
1496,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1497,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,In even less significant verse the most maudlin sympathy with Keats is
1498,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,expressed. One is tempted to feel that Keats suffered less from his
1499,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"enemies than from his admirers, of the type which Browning characterized"
1500,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"as ""the foolish crowd of rushers-in upon genius ... never content till"
1501,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,they cut their initials on the cheek of the Medicean Venus to prove they
1502,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"worship her."" [Footnote: Letter to Elizabeth Barrett, November 17,"
1503,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,1845.]
1504,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1505,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"With the possible exception of Chatterton, the poet whose wrongs have"
1506,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"raised the most indignant storm of protest is Shelley. Several poets, as"
1507,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"the young Browning, Francis Thompson, James Thomson, B. V., and Mr."
1508,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Woodberry, have made a chivalrous championing of Shelley almost part of"
1509,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,their poetical platform. No doubt the facts of Shelley's life warrant
1510,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"such sympathy. Then too, Shelley's sense of injustice, unlike Byron's,"
1511,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"is not such as to seem weak to us, though it is so freely expressed in"
1512,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,his verse. In addition one is likely to feel particular sympathy for
1513,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Shelley because the recoil of the public from him cannot be laid to his
1514,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,scorn. His enthusiasms were always for the happiness of the entire human
1515,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"race, as well as for himself. Everything in his unfortunate life vouches"
1516,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"for the sincerity of his statement, in the _Hymn to Intellectual"
1517,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Beauty_:
1518,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1519,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Never joy illumed my brow
1520,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Unlinked with hope that thou wouldst free
1521,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,This world from its dark slavery.
1522,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1523,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Accordingly Shelley's injuries seem to have affected him as a sudden
1524,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"hurt does a child, with a sense of incomprehensibility, and later poets"
1525,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,have rallied to his defense as if he were actually a child.[Footnote:
1526,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"See E. C. Stedman, _Ariel_; James Thomson, B. V., _Shelley_; Alfred"
1527,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Austin, _Shelley's Death_; Stephen Vincent Benét, _The General Public_.]"
1528,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1529,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,The vicariousness of the nineteenth century poet in bewailing the hurts
1530,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"of his brethren is likely to have provoked a smile in us, as in the"
1531,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"mourners of Adonais, at recognizing one"
1532,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1533,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Who in another's fate now wept his own.
1534,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1535,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Of course a suppressed personal grudge may not always have been a factor
1536,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,in lending warmth to these defenses. Mrs. Browning is an ardent advocate
1537,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"of the misunderstood poet, though she herself enjoyed a full measure of"
1538,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"popularity. But when Landor so warmly champions Southey, and Swinburne"
1539,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"springs to the defense of Victor Hugo, one cannot help remembering that"
1540,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,the public did not show itself wildly appreciative of either of these
1541,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"defenders. So, too, when Oscar Wilde works himself up over the"
1542,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"persecutions of Dante, Keats and Byron, we are minded of the irreverent"
1543,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,crowds that followed Wilde and his lily down the street. When the poet
1544,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"is too proud to complain of his own wrongs at the hands of the public,"
1545,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,it is easy for him to strike in defense of another. As the last century
1546,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"wore on, this vicarious indignation more and more took the place of a"
1547,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,personal outcry. Comparatively little has been said by poets since the
1548,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"romantic period about their own persecutions.[Footnote: See, however,"
1549,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Joaquin Miller, _I Shall Remember_, and _Vale_; Francis Ledwidge, _The"
1550,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Visitation of Peace_.]
1551,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1552,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Occasionally a poet endeavors to placate the public by assuming a pose
1553,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"of equality. The tradition of Chaucer, fostered by the _Canterbury"
1554,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Tales_, is that by carefully hiding his genius, he succeeded in"
1555,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"keeping on excellent terms with his contemporaries. Percy Mackaye, in"
1556,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"the _Canterbury Pilgrims_, shows him obeying St. Paul's injunction"
1557,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"so literally that the parson takes him for a brother of the cloth, the"
1558,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"plowman is surprised that he can read, and so on, through the whole"
1559,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,social gamut of the Pilgrims. But in the nineteenth century this
1560,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,friendly attitude seldom works out so well. Walt Whitman flaunts his
1561,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,ability to fraternize with the man of the street. But the American
1562,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"public has failed ""to absorb him as affectionately as he has absorbed"
1563,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"it."" [Footnote: _By Blue Ontario's Shore._] Emerson tries to get on"
1564,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,common ground with his audience by asserting that every man is a poet to
1565,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"some extent,[Footnote: See _The Enchanter_.] and it is consistent"
1566,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,with the poetic theory of Yeats that he makes the same assertion as
1567,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Emerson:
1568,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1569,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"There cannot be confusion of sound forgot,"
1570,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,A single soul that lacks a sweet crystalline cry.
1571,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote:  _Pandeen._]
1572,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1573,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"But when the mob jeers at a poet, it does not take kindly to his retort,"
1574,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"""Poet yourself."" Longfellow, J. G. Holland and James Whitcombe Riley"
1575,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,have been warmly commended by some of their brothers [Footnote: See O.

1577,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Read, _A Leaf from the Past_; E. C. Stedman, _J. G. H._; P. L. Dunbar,"
1578,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"_James Whitcombe Riley_; J. W. Riley, _Rhymes of Ironquill_.] for their"
1579,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"promiscuous friendliness, but on the whole there is a tendency on the"
1580,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"part of the public to sniff at these poets, as well as at those who"
1581,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"commend them, because they make themselves so common. One may deride the"
1582,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"public's inconsistency, yet, after all, we have not to read many pages"
1583,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"of the ""homely"" poets before their professed ability to get down to the"
1584,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"level of the ""common man"" begins to remind one of pre-campaign speeches."
1585,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1586,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"There seems to be nothing for the poet to do, then, but to accept the"
1587,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,hostility of the world philosophically. There are a few notable examples
1588,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"of the poet even welcoming the solitude that society forces upon him,"
1589,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,because it affords additional opportunity for self-communion. Everyone
1590,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,is familiar with Wordsworth's insistence that uncompanionableness is
1591,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"essential to the poet. In the _Prelude_ he relates how, from early"
1592,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"childhood,"
1593,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1594,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"I was taught to feel, perhaps too much,"
1595,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,The self-sufficing power of solitude.
1596,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1597,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Elsewhere he disposes of the forms of social intercourse:
1598,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1599,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"These all wear out of me, like Forms, with chalk"
1600,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Painted on rich men's floors, for one feast night."
1601,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: _Personal Talk_.]
1602,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1603,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,So he describes the poet's character:
1604,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1605,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,He is retired as noontide dew
1606,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Or fountain in a noonday grove.
1607,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: _The Poet's Epitaph_.]
1608,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1609,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"In American verse Wordsworth's mood is, of course, reflected in Bryant,"
1610,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,and it appears in the poetry of most of Bryant's contemporaries.
1611,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Longfellow caused the poet to boast that he ""had no friends, and needed"
1612,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"none."" [Footnote: _Michael Angelo_.] Emerson expressed the same mood"
1613,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,frankly. He takes civil leave of mankind:
1614,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1615,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Think me not unkind and rude
1616,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,That I walk alone in grove and glen;
1617,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"I go to the god of the wood,"
1618,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,To fetch his word to men.
1619,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: _The Apology_.]
1620,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1621,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,He points out the idiosyncrasy of the poet:
1622,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1623,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Men consort in camp and town,"
1624,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,But the poet dwells alone.
1625,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: _Saadi_.]
1626,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1627,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Thus he works up to his climactic statement regarding the amplitude of
1628,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,the poet's personality:
1629,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1630,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,I have no brothers and no peers
1631,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,And the dearest interferes;
1632,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"When I would spend a lonely day,"
1633,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Sun and moon are in my way.
1634,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: _The Poet_.]
1635,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1636,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Although the poet's egotism would seem logically to cause him to find
1637,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"his chief pleasure in undisturbed communion with himself, still this"
1638,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"picture of the poet delighting in solitude cannot be said to follow,"
1639,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"usually, upon his banishment from society. For the most part the poet is"
1640,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"characterized by an insatiable yearning for affection, and by the"
1641,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"stupidity and hostility of other men he is driven into proud loneliness,"
1642,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,even while his heart thirsts for companionship.[Footnote: See John

1652,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,declares:
1653,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1654,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"For me, I'd rather live"
1655,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"With this weak human heart and yearning blood,"
1656,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Lonely as God, than mate with barren souls."
1657,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"More brave, more beautiful than myself must be"
1658,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,The man whom I can truly call my friend.
1659,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"[Footnote: Alexander Smith, _A Life Drama_.]"
1660,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1661,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"So the poet is limited to the companionship of rare souls, who make up"
1662,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,to him for the indifference of all the world beside. Occasionally this
1663,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"compensation is found in romantic love, which flames all the brighter,"
1664,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,because the affections that most people expend on many human
1665,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,relationships are by the poet turned upon one object. Apropos of the
1666,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"world's indifference to him, Shelley takes comfort in the assurance of"
1667,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"such communion, saying to Mary,"
1668,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1669,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,If men must rise and stamp with fury blind
1670,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"On his pure name who loves them--thou and I,"
1671,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Sweet friend! can look from our tranquillity
1672,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Like lamps into the world's tempestuous night,--"
1673,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Two tranquil stars, while clouds are passing by,"
1674,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,That burn from year to year with inextinguished light.
1675,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: Introduction to _The Revolt of Islam_.]
1676,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1677,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"But though passion is so often the source of his inspiration, the poet's"
1678,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,love affairs are seldom allowed to flourish. The only alleviation of his
1679,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"loneliness must be, then, in the friendship of unusually gifted and"
1680,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"discerning men, usually of his own calling. Doubtless the ideal of most"
1681,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,nineteenth century writers would be such a jolly fraternity of poets as
1682,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Herrick has made immortal by his _Lines to Ben Jonson_.[Footnote:
1683,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"The tradition of the lonely poet was in existence even at this time,"
1684,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"however. See Ben Jonson, _Essay on Donne_.] A good deal of nineteenth"
1685,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,century verse shows the author enviously dwelling upon the ideal
1686,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,comradeship of Elizabethan poets.[Footnote: Keats' _Lines on the
1687,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Mermaid Tavern_, Browning's _At the Mermaid_, Watts-Dunton's _Christmas"
1688,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"at the Mermaid_, E. A. Robinson's _Ben Jonson Entertains a Man from"
1689,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Stratford_, Josephine Preston Peabody's _Marlowe_, and Alfred Noyes'"
1690,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,_Tales of the Mermaid Inn_ all present fondly imagined accounts of the
1691,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"gay intimacy of the master dramatists. Keats, who was so generous in"
1692,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"acknowledging his indebtedness to contemporary artists, tells, in his"
1693,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"epistles, of the envy he feels for men who created under these ideal"
1694,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,conditions of comradeship.] But multiple friendships did not flourish
1695,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"among poets of the last century,--at least they were overhung by no"
1696,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,glamor of romance that lured the poet to immortalize them in verse. The
1697,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,closest approximation to such a thing is in the redundant complimentary
1698,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"verse, with which the New England poets showered each other to such an"
1699,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,extent as to arouse Lowell's protest. [Footnote: See _A Fable for
1700,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Critics_.] Even they, however, did not represent themselves as living in"
1701,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Bohemian intimacy. Possibly the temperamental jealousy that the
1702,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"philistine world ascribes to the artist, causing him to feel that he is"
1703,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"the one elect soul sent to a benighted age, while his brother-artists"
1704,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"are akin to the money-changers in the temple, hinders him from"
1705,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,unreserved enjoyment even of his fellows' society. Tennyson's and
1706,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Swinburne's outbreaks against contemporary writers appear to be based on
1707,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"some such assumption. [Footnote: See Tennyson, _The New Timon and the"
1708,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Poet_; Bulwer Lytton, _The New Timon_; Swinburne, _Essay on Whitman_."
1709,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"For more recent manifestation of the same attitude see John Drinkwater,"
1710,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"_To Alice Meynell_ (1911); Shaemas O'Sheel, _The Poets with the Sounding"
1711,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Gong_ (1912); Robert Graves, _The Voice of Beauty Drowned_ (1920).]"
1712,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1713,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Consequently the poet is likely to celebrate one or two deep friendships
1714,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,in an otherwise lonely life. A few instances of such friendships are so
1715,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"notable, that the reader is likely to overlook their rarity. Such were"
1716,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"the friendships of Wordsworth and Coleridge, and of Wordsworth and his"
1717,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"sister Dorothy, also that recorded in Landor's shaken lines:"
1718,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1719,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Friends! hear the words my wandering thoughts would say,"
1720,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,And cast them into shape some other day;
1721,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Southey, my friend of forty years, is gone,"
1722,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"And shattered with the fall, I stand alone."
1723,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1724,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"The intimacy of Shelley and Byron, recorded in _Julian and Maddalo_, was"
1725,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"of a less ardent sort. Indeed Byron said of it, ""As to friendship, it is"
1726,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,a propensity in which my genius is very limited.... I did not even feel
1727,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"it for Shelley, however much I admired him."" [Footnote: Letter to Mrs."
1728,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"(Shelley?) undated.] Arnold's _Thyrsis_, Tennyson's _In Memoriam_, and"
1729,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"more recently, George Edward Woodberry's _North Shore Watch_, indicate"
1730,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,that even when the poet has been able to find a human soul which
1731,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"understood him, the friendship has been cut short by death. In fact, the"
1732,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,premature close of such friendships has usually been the occasion for
1733,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"their celebration in verse, from classic times onward."
1734,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1735,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Such friendships, like happy love-affairs, are too infrequent and"
1736,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,transitory to dissipate the poet's conviction that he is the loneliest
1737,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"of men. ""Thy soul was like a star and dwelt apart,"" might have been"
1738,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"written by almost any nineteenth century poet about any other. Shelley,"
1739,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"in particular, in spite of his not infrequent attachments, is almost"
1740,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,obsessed by melancholy reflection upon his loneliness. In _To a
1741,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Skylark_, he pictures the poet ""hidden in the light of thought."""
1742,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Employing the opposite figure in the _Defense of Poetry_, he says,"
1743,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"""The poet is a nightingale who sits in darkness and sings to cheer his"
1744,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"own solitude."" Of the poet in _Alastor_ we are told,"
1745,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1746,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"He lived, he died, he sung, in solitude."
1747,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1748,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Shelley's sense of his personal loneliness is recorded in _Stanzas
1749,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Written in Dejection_, and also in _Adonais_. In the latter poem"
1750,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"he says of himself,"
1751,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1752,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"He came the last, neglected and apart,"
1753,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1754,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,and describes himself as
1755,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1756,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,companionless
1757,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"As the last cloud of an expiring storm,"
1758,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Whose thunder is its knell.
1759,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1760,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Victorian poets were not less depressed by reflection upon the poet's
1761,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"lonely life. Arnold strikes the note again and again, most poignantly in"
1762,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"_The Buried Life_, of the poet's sensitive apprehension that all"
1763,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"human intercourse is mockery, and that the gifted soul really dwells in"
1764,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,isolation. _Sordello_ is a monumental record of a genius without
1765,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"friends. Francis Thompson, with surface lightness, tells us, in _A"
1766,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Renegade Poet on the Poet:_
1767,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1768,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"He alone of men, though he travel to the pit, picks   up no"
1769,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"company by the way; but has a contrivance to avoid scripture,"
1770,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"and find a narrow road to damnation. Indeed, if the majority"
1771,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"of men go to the nether abodes, 'tis the most hopeful argument"
1772,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"I know of his salvation, for 'tis inconceivable that he should"
1773,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,ever do as other men.
1774,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1775,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,One might imagine that in the end the poet's poignant sense of his
1776,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,isolation might allay his excessive conceit. A yearning for something
1777,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"beyond himself might lead him to infer a lack in his own nature. Seldom,"
1778,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"however, is this the result of the poet's loneliness. Francis Thompson,"
1779,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"indeed, does feel himself humbled by his spiritual solitude, and"
1780,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"characterizes himself,"
1781,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1782,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"I who can scarcely speak my fellows' speech,"
1783,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"Love their love or mine own love to them teach,"
1784,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"A bastard barred from their inheritance,"
1785,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,*       *       *       *       *
1786,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"In antre of this lowly body set,"
1787,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Girt with a thirsty solitude of soul.
1788,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,[Footnote: _Sister Songs_.]
1789,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1790,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"But the typical poet yearns not downward, but upward, and above him he"
1791,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,finds nothing. Therefore reflection upon his loneliness continually
1792,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,draws his attention to the fact that his isolation is an inevitable
1793,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"consequence of his genius,--that he"
1794,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1795,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Spares but the cloudy border of his base
1796,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,To the foiled searching of mortality.
1797,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"[Footnote: Matthew Arnold, Sonnet, _Shakespeare_.]"
1798,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1799,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"The poet usually looks for alleviation of his loneliness after death,"
1800,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"when he is gathered to the company of his peers, but to the supreme poet"
1801,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,he feels that even this satisfaction is denied. The highest genius must
1802,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"exist absolutely in and for itself, the poet-egoist is led to conclude,"
1803,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"for it will ""remain at heart unread eternally."" [Footnote: Thomas Hardy,"
1804,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,_To Shakespeare_.]
1805,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,
1806,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,Such is the self-perpetuating principle which appears to insure
1807,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,perennial growth of the poet's egoism. The mystery of inspiration breeds
1808,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,introspection; introspection breeds egoism; egoism breeds pride; pride
1809,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,breeds contempt for other men; contempt for other men breeds hostility
1810,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"and persecution; persecution breeds proud isolation. Finally, isolation"
1811,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,"breeds deeper introspection, and the poet is ready to start on a second"
1812,THE EGOCENTRIC CIRCLE,revolution of the egocentric circle.

1820,THE MORTAL COIL,
1821,THE MORTAL COIL,If I might dwell where Israfel
1822,THE MORTAL COIL,"Hath dwelt, and he where I,"
1823,THE MORTAL COIL,He might not sing so wildly well
1824,THE MORTAL COIL,"A mortal melody,"
1825,THE MORTAL COIL,
1826,THE MORTAL COIL,"sighs Poe, and the envious note vibrates in much of modern song. There"
1827,THE MORTAL COIL,"is an inconsistency in the poet's attitude,--the same inconsistency that"
1828,THE MORTAL COIL,"lurks in the most poetical of philosophies. Like Plato, the poet sees"
1829,THE MORTAL COIL,"this world as the veritable body of his love, Beauty,--and yet it is to"
1830,THE MORTAL COIL,"him a muddy vesture of decay, and he is ever panting for escape from it"
1831,THE MORTAL COIL,as from a prison house.
1832,THE MORTAL COIL,
1833,THE MORTAL COIL,One might think that the poet has less cause for rebellion against the
1834,THE MORTAL COIL,"flesh than have other men, inasmuch as the bonds that enthrall feebler"
1835,THE MORTAL COIL,"spirits seem to have no power upon him. A blind Homer, a mad Tasso, a"
1836,THE MORTAL COIL,"derelict Villon, an invalid Pope, most wonderful of all--a woman Sappho,"
1837,THE MORTAL COIL,suggest that the differences in earthly tabernacles upon which most of
1838,THE MORTAL COIL,"us lay stress are negligible to the poet, whose burning genius can"
1839,THE MORTAL COIL,"consume all fetters of heredity, sex, health, environment and material"
1840,THE MORTAL COIL,endowment. Yet in his soberest moments the poet is wont to confess that
1841,THE MORTAL COIL,there are varying degrees in the handicap which genius suffers in the
1842,THE MORTAL COIL,mid-earth life; in fact ever since the romantic movement roused in him
1843,THE MORTAL COIL,"an intense curiosity as to his own nature, he has reflected a good deal"
1844,THE MORTAL COIL,on the question of what earthly conditions will least cabin and confine
1845,THE MORTAL COIL,his spirit.
1846,THE MORTAL COIL,
1847,THE MORTAL COIL,Apparently the problem of heredity is too involved to stir him to
1848,THE MORTAL COIL,attempted solution. If to make a gentleman one must begin with his
1849,THE MORTAL COIL,"grandfather, surely to make a poet one must begin with the race, and in"
1850,THE MORTAL COIL,poems even of such bulk as the _Prelude_ one does not find a complete
1851,THE MORTAL COIL,analysis of the singer's forbears. In only one case do we delve far into
1852,THE MORTAL COIL,"a poet's heredity. He who will, may perchance hear Sordello's story"
1853,THE MORTAL COIL,"told, even from his remote ancestry, but to the untutored reader the"
1854,THE MORTAL COIL,only clear point regarding heredity is the fusion in Sordello of the
1855,THE MORTAL COIL,"restless energy and acumen of his father, Taurello, with the refinement"
1856,THE MORTAL COIL,"and sensibility of his mother, Retrude. This is a promising combination,"
1857,THE MORTAL COIL,but would it necessarily flower in genius? One doubts it. In _Aurora
1858,THE MORTAL COIL,Leigh_ one might speculate similarly about the spiritual aestheticism
1859,THE MORTAL COIL,of Aurora's Italian mother balanced by the intellectual repose of her
1860,THE MORTAL COIL,English father. Doubtless the Brownings were not working blindly in
1861,THE MORTAL COIL,"giving their poets this heredity, yet in both characters we must assume,"
1862,THE MORTAL COIL,"if we are to be scientific, that there is a happy combination of"
1863,THE MORTAL COIL,qualities derived from more remote ancestors.
1864,THE MORTAL COIL,
1865,THE MORTAL COIL,The immemorial tradition which Swinburne followed in giving his mythical
1866,THE MORTAL COIL,"poet the sun as father and the sea as mother is more illuminating,"
1867,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: See _Thalassius_.] since it typifies the union in the
1868,THE MORTAL COIL,poet's nature of the earthly and the heavenly. Whenever heredity is
1869,THE MORTAL COIL,lightly touched upon in poetry it is generally indicated that in the
1870,THE MORTAL COIL,"poet's nature there are combined, for the first time, these two powerful"
1871,THE MORTAL COIL,"strains which, in mysterious fusion, constitute the poetic nature. In"
1872,THE MORTAL COIL,"the marriage of his father and mother, delight in the senses, absorption"
1873,THE MORTAL COIL,"in the turbulence of human passions, is likely to meet complete"
1874,THE MORTAL COIL,otherworldliness and unusual spiritual sensitiveness.
1875,THE MORTAL COIL,
1876,THE MORTAL COIL,There is a tradition that all great men have resembled their mothers;
1877,THE MORTAL COIL,this may in part account for the fact that the poet often writes of her.
1878,THE MORTAL COIL,Yet in poetical pictures of the mother the reader seldom finds anything
1879,THE MORTAL COIL,patently explaining genius in her child. The glimpse we have of Ben
1880,THE MORTAL COIL,Jonson's mother is an exception. A twentieth century poet conceives of
1881,THE MORTAL COIL,"the woman who was ""no churl"" as"
1882,THE MORTAL COIL,
1883,THE MORTAL COIL,"A tall, gaunt woman, with great burning eyes,"
1884,THE MORTAL COIL,And white hair blown back softly from a face
1885,THE MORTAL COIL,"Etherially fierce, as might have looked"
1886,THE MORTAL COIL,Cassandra in old age.
1887,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: Alfred Noyes, _Tales of the Mermaid Inn_.]"
1888,THE MORTAL COIL,
1889,THE MORTAL COIL,"In the usual description, however, there is none of this dynamic force."
1890,THE MORTAL COIL,"Womanliness, above all, and sympathy, poets ascribe to their mothers."
1891,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: See Beattie, _The Minstrel_; Wordsworth, _The Prelude_;"
1892,THE MORTAL COIL,"Cowper, _Lines on his Mother's Picture_; Swinburne, _Ode to his Mother_;"
1893,THE MORTAL COIL,"J. G. Holland, _Kathrina_; William Vaughan Moody, _The Daguerreotype_;"
1894,THE MORTAL COIL,"Anna Hempstead Branch, _Her Words_.] A little poem by Sara Teasdale,"
1895,THE MORTAL COIL,"_The Mother of a Poet_, gives a poetical explanation of this type of"
1896,THE MORTAL COIL,"woman, in whom all the turbulence of the poet's spiritual inheritance is"
1897,THE MORTAL COIL,"hushed before it is transmitted to him. Such a mother as Byron's, while"
1898,THE MORTAL COIL,she appeals to certain novelists as a means of intensifying the poet's
1899,THE MORTAL COIL,"adversities, [Footnote: See H. E. Rives, _The Castaway_ (1904); J. D."
1900,THE MORTAL COIL,"Bacon, _A Family Affair_ (1900).] is not found in verse. One might"
1901,THE MORTAL COIL,almost conclude that poets consider their maternal heritage
1902,THE MORTAL COIL,indispensable. Very seldom is there such a departure from tradition as
1903,THE MORTAL COIL,making the father bequeather of the poet's sensitiveness. [Footnote: _A
1904,THE MORTAL COIL,"Ballad in Blank Verse_, by John Davidson, is a rare exception.]"
1905,THE MORTAL COIL,
1906,THE MORTAL COIL,The inheritance of a specific literary gift is almost never insisted
1907,THE MORTAL COIL,"upon by poets, [Footnote: See, however, Anna Hempstead Branch, _Her"
1908,THE MORTAL COIL,"Words_.] though some of the verse addressed to the child, Hartley"
1909,THE MORTAL COIL,"Coleridge, possibly implies a belief in such heritage. The son of Robert"
1910,THE MORTAL COIL,"and Mrs. Browning seems, strangely enough, considering his chance of a"
1911,THE MORTAL COIL,"double inheritance of literary ability, not to have been the subject of"
1912,THE MORTAL COIL,versified prophecies of this sort. One expression by a poet of belief in
1913,THE MORTAL COIL,"heredity may, however, detain us. At the beginning of Viola Meynell's"
1914,THE MORTAL COIL,"career, it is interesting to notice that as a child she was the subject"
1915,THE MORTAL COIL,of speculation as to her inheritance of her mother's genius. It was

1927,THE MORTAL COIL,which they grow.
1928,THE MORTAL COIL,
1929,THE MORTAL COIL,What have poets to say on the larger question of their social
1930,THE MORTAL COIL,"inheritance? This is a subject on which, at the beginning of the"
1931,THE MORTAL COIL,"nineteenth century, at least, poets should have had ideas, and the"
1932,THE MORTAL COIL,varying rank given to their lyrical heroes is not without significance.
1933,THE MORTAL COIL,"The renaissance idea, that the nobleman is framed to enjoy, rather than"
1934,THE MORTAL COIL,"to create, beauty,--that he is the connoisseur rather than the"
1935,THE MORTAL COIL,"genius,--seems to have persisted in the eighteenth century, and at the"
1936,THE MORTAL COIL,beginning of the romantic movement to have combined with the new
1937,THE MORTAL COIL,exaltation of the lower classes to work against the plausible view that
1938,THE MORTAL COIL,the poet is the exquisite flowering of the highest lineage.
1939,THE MORTAL COIL,
1940,THE MORTAL COIL,"Of course, it is not to be expected that there should be unanimity of"
1941,THE MORTAL COIL,"opinion among poets as to the ideal singer's rank. In several instances,"
1942,THE MORTAL COIL,confidence in human egotism would enable the reader to make a shrewd
1943,THE MORTAL COIL,"guess as to a poet's stand on the question of caste, without the trouble"
1944,THE MORTAL COIL,"of investigation. Gray, the gentleman, as a matter of course consigns"
1945,THE MORTAL COIL,"his ""rustic Milton"" to oblivion. Lord Byron follows the fortunes of"
1946,THE MORTAL COIL,"""Childe"" Harold. Lord Tennyson usually deals with titled artists."
1947,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: See _Lord Burleigh_, Eleanore in _A Becket_, and the Count in"
1948,THE MORTAL COIL,_The Falcon_.] Greater significance attaches to the gentle birth of the
1949,THE MORTAL COIL,"two prominent fictional poets of the century, Sordello and Aurora Leigh,"
1950,THE MORTAL COIL,yet in both poems the plot interest is enough to account for it. In
1951,THE MORTAL COIL,"Sordello's case, especially, Taurello's dramatic offer of political"
1952,THE MORTAL COIL,leadership to his son suffices to justify Browning's choice of his
1953,THE MORTAL COIL,hero's rank. [Footnote: Other poems celebrating noble poets are _The
1954,THE MORTAL COIL,"Troubadour_, Praed; _The King's Tragedy_, Rossetti; _David, Charles di"
1955,THE MORTAL COIL,"Trocca_, Cale Young Rice.]"
1956,THE MORTAL COIL,
1957,THE MORTAL COIL,"None of these instances of aristocratic birth are of much importance,"
1958,THE MORTAL COIL,and wherever there is a suggestion that the poet's birth represents a
1959,THE MORTAL COIL,"tenet of the poem's maker, one finds, naturally, praise of the singer"
1960,THE MORTAL COIL,who springs from the masses. The question of the singer's social origin
1961,THE MORTAL COIL,was awake in verse even before Burns. So typical an eighteenth century
1962,THE MORTAL COIL,"poet as John Hughes, in lines _On a Print of Tom Burton, a Small Coal"
1963,THE MORTAL COIL,"Man_, moralizes on the phenomenon that genius may enter into the"
1964,THE MORTAL COIL,breast of one quite beyond the social pale. Crabbe [Footnote: See _The
1965,THE MORTAL COIL,"Patron_.] and Beattie,[Footnote: See _The Minstrel_.] also, seem"
1966,THE MORTAL COIL,not to be departing from the Augustan tradition in treating the fortunes
1967,THE MORTAL COIL,"of their peasant bards. But with Burns, of course, the question comes"
1968,THE MORTAL COIL,into new prominence. Yet he spreads no propaganda. His statement is
1969,THE MORTAL COIL,merely personal:
1970,THE MORTAL COIL,
1971,THE MORTAL COIL,Gie me ae spark of nature's fire!
1972,THE MORTAL COIL,That's a' the learning I desire.
1973,THE MORTAL COIL,"Then, though I drudge through dub and mire"
1974,THE MORTAL COIL,"At plough or cart,"
1975,THE MORTAL COIL,"My muse, though homely in attire,"
1976,THE MORTAL COIL,May touch the heart.
1977,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _Epistle to Lapraik_.]
1978,THE MORTAL COIL,
1979,THE MORTAL COIL,It is not till later verse that poets springing from the soil are given
1980,THE MORTAL COIL,"sweeping praise, because of the mysterious communion they enjoy with"
1981,THE MORTAL COIL,"""nature."" [Footnote: For verse glorifying the peasant aspect of Burns"

1985,THE MORTAL COIL,"Richard Realf, _Burns_; Simon Kerl, _Burns_ (1868); Shelley Halleck,"
1986,THE MORTAL COIL,"_Burns_.] Obviously the doctrine is reinforced by Wordsworth, though few"
1987,THE MORTAL COIL,"of his farmer folk are geniuses, and the closest illustration of his"
1988,THE MORTAL COIL,"belief that the peasant, the child of nature, is the true poet, is found"
1989,THE MORTAL COIL,"in the character of the old pedlar, in the _Excursion_. The origin of"
1990,THE MORTAL COIL,Keats might be assumed to have its share in molding poets' views on
1991,THE MORTAL COIL,"caste, but only the most insensitive have dared to touch upon his"
1992,THE MORTAL COIL,"Cockney birth. In the realm of Best Sellers, however, the hero of May"
1993,THE MORTAL COIL,"Sinclair's novel, _The Divine Fire_, who is presumably modeled after"
1994,THE MORTAL COIL,"Keats, is a lower class Londoner, presented with the most unflinching"
1995,THE MORTAL COIL,realism that the author can achieve. Consummate indeed is the artistry
1996,THE MORTAL COIL,"with which she enables him to keep the sympathy of his readers, even"
1997,THE MORTAL COIL,while he commits the unpardonable sin of dropping his h's. [Footnote:
1998,THE MORTAL COIL,Another historical poet whose lowly origin is stressed in poetry is
1999,THE MORTAL COIL,"Marlowe, the son of a cobbler. See Alfred Noyes, _At the Sign of the"
2000,THE MORTAL COIL,"Golden Shoe_; Josephine Preston Peabody, _Marlowe_.] Here and there, the"
2001,THE MORTAL COIL,"poet from the ranks lifts his head in verse, throughout the last"
2002,THE MORTAL COIL,"century. [Footnote: For poet-heroes of this sort see John Clare, _The"
2003,THE MORTAL COIL,"Peasant Poet_; Mrs. Browning, _Lady Geraldine's Courtship_; Robert"
2004,THE MORTAL COIL,"Buchanan, _Poet Andrew_; T. E. Browne, _Tommy Big Eyes_; Whittier,"
2005,THE MORTAL COIL,"_Eliot_; J. G. Saxe, _Murillo and his Slave_.] And at present, with the"
2006,THE MORTAL COIL,"penetration of the ""realistic"" movement into verse, one notes a slight"
2007,THE MORTAL COIL,"revival of interest in the type, probably because the lower classes are"
2008,THE MORTAL COIL,popularly conceived to have more first hand acquaintance with sordidness
2009,THE MORTAL COIL,than those hedged about by family tradition. [Footnote: See John
2010,THE MORTAL COIL,"Davidson, _A Ballad in Blank Verse_; Vachel Lindsay, _The North Star"
2011,THE MORTAL COIL,"Whispers to the Blacksmith's Son_; John Masefield, _Dauber_; Francis"
2012,THE MORTAL COIL,"Carlin, _MacSweeney the Rhymer_ (1918).] Still, for the most part, the"
2013,THE MORTAL COIL,present attitude of poets toward the question seems to be one of
2014,THE MORTAL COIL,"indifference, since they feel that other factors are more important than"
2015,THE MORTAL COIL,caste in determining the singer's genius. Most writers of today would
2016,THE MORTAL COIL,"probably agree with the sentiment of the lines on Browning,"
2017,THE MORTAL COIL,
2018,THE MORTAL COIL,What if men have found
2019,THE MORTAL COIL,Poor footmen or rich merchants on the roll
2020,THE MORTAL COIL,Of his forbears? Did they beget his soul?
2021,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: Henry van Dyke, _Sonnet_.]"
2022,THE MORTAL COIL,
2023,THE MORTAL COIL,If poets have given us no adequate body of data by which we may predict
2024,THE MORTAL COIL,"the birth of a genius, they have, on the other hand, given us most"
2025,THE MORTAL COIL,minute descriptions whereby we may recognize the husk containing the
2026,THE MORTAL COIL,"poetic gift. The skeptic may ask, What has the poet to do with his body?"
2027,THE MORTAL COIL,since singers tell
2028,THE MORTAL COIL,
2029,THE MORTAL COIL,"us so repeatedly that their souls are aliens upon earth,"
2030,THE MORTAL COIL,Clothed in flesh to suffer: maimed of wings to soar.
2031,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _The Centenary of Shelley_.]
2032,THE MORTAL COIL,
2033,THE MORTAL COIL,"as Swinburne phrases it. Yet, mysteriously, the artist's soul is said to"
2034,THE MORTAL COIL,frame a tenement for its brief imprisonment that approximately expresses
2035,THE MORTAL COIL,"it, so that it is only in the most beautiful bodies that we are to look"
2036,THE MORTAL COIL,for the soul that creates beauty. Though poets of our time have not
2037,THE MORTAL COIL,troubled themselves much with philosophical explanations of the
2038,THE MORTAL COIL,"phenomenon, they seem to concur in the Platonic reasoning of their"
2039,THE MORTAL COIL,"father Spenser, who argues,"
2040,THE MORTAL COIL,
2041,THE MORTAL COIL,"So every spirit, as it is most pure,"
2042,THE MORTAL COIL,"And hath in it the more of heavenly light,"
2043,THE MORTAL COIL,So it the fairer body doth procure
2044,THE MORTAL COIL,"To habit in, and it more fairly dight"
2045,THE MORTAL COIL,"With cheerful grace, and amiable sight;"
2046,THE MORTAL COIL,"For of the soul the body form doth take,"
2047,THE MORTAL COIL,"For soul is form, and doth the body make."
2048,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _Hymn in Honour of Beauty_.]
2049,THE MORTAL COIL,
2050,THE MORTAL COIL,"What an absurd test! one is likely to exclaim, thinking of a swarthy"
2051,THE MORTAL COIL,"Sappho, a fat Chaucer, a bald Shakespeare, a runt Pope, a club-footed"
2052,THE MORTAL COIL,"Byron, and so on, almost _ad infinitum_. Would not a survey of notable"
2053,THE MORTAL COIL,geniuses rather indicate that the poet's dreams arise because he is like
2054,THE MORTAL COIL,"the sensitive plant of Shelley's allegory, which"
2055,THE MORTAL COIL,
2056,THE MORTAL COIL,"Desires what it hath not, the beautiful?[Footnote: _The Sensitive"

2058,THE MORTAL COIL,
2059,THE MORTAL COIL,Spenser himself foresaw our objections and felt obliged to modify his
2060,THE MORTAL COIL,"pronouncement, admitting--"
2061,THE MORTAL COIL,
2062,THE MORTAL COIL,Yet oft it falls that many a gentle mind
2063,THE MORTAL COIL,"Dwells in deformed tabernacle drownd,"
2064,THE MORTAL COIL,"Either by chance, against the course of kind,"
2065,THE MORTAL COIL,"Or through unaptness of the substance found,"
2066,THE MORTAL COIL,Which it assumed of some stubborn ground
2067,THE MORTAL COIL,"That will not yield unto her form's direction,"
2068,THE MORTAL COIL,But is preformed with some foul imperfection.
2069,THE MORTAL COIL,
2070,THE MORTAL COIL,But the modern poet is not likely to yield his point so easily as does
2071,THE MORTAL COIL,"Spenser. Rather he will cast aside historical records as spurious, and"
2072,THE MORTAL COIL,insist that all genuine poets have been beautiful. Of the many poems on
2073,THE MORTAL COIL,"Sappho written in the last century, not one accepts the tradition that"
2074,THE MORTAL COIL,"she was ill-favored, but restores a flower-like portrait of her from"
2075,THE MORTAL COIL,"Alcæus' line,"
2076,THE MORTAL COIL,
2077,THE MORTAL COIL,"Violet-weaving, pure, sweet-smiling Sappho."
2078,THE MORTAL COIL,
2079,THE MORTAL COIL,"As for Shakespeare, here follows a very characteristic idealization of"
2080,THE MORTAL COIL,his extant portrait:
2081,THE MORTAL COIL,
2082,THE MORTAL COIL,"A pale, plain-favored face, the smile where-of"
2083,THE MORTAL COIL,"Is beautiful; the eyes gray, changeful, bright,"
2084,THE MORTAL COIL,"Low-lidded now, and luminous as love,"
2085,THE MORTAL COIL,"Anon soul-searching, ominous as night,"
2086,THE MORTAL COIL,"Seer-like, inscrutable, revealing deeps"
2087,THE MORTAL COIL,Where-in a mighty spirit wakes or sleeps.
2088,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: C. L. Hildreth, _At the Mermaid_ (1889).]"
2089,THE MORTAL COIL,
2090,THE MORTAL COIL,The most unflattering portrait is no bar to poets' confidence in their
2091,THE MORTAL COIL,"brother's beauty, yet they are happiest when fashioning a frame for"
2092,THE MORTAL COIL,"geniuses of whom we have no authentic description. ""The love-dream of"
2093,THE MORTAL COIL,"his unrecorded face,"" [Footnote: Rossetti, _Sonnet on Chatterton_.]"
2094,THE MORTAL COIL,has led to many an idealized portrait of such a long-dead singer.
2095,THE MORTAL COIL,Marlowe has been the favorite figure of this sort with which the fancies
2096,THE MORTAL COIL,of our poets have played. From the glory and power of his dramas their
2097,THE MORTAL COIL,imaginations inevitably turn to
2098,THE MORTAL COIL,
2099,THE MORTAL COIL,"The gloriole of his flame-coloured hair,"
2100,THE MORTAL COIL,"The lean, athletic body, deftly planned"
2101,THE MORTAL COIL,To carry that swift soul of fire and air;
2102,THE MORTAL COIL,"The long, thin flanks, the broad breast, and the grand"
2103,THE MORTAL COIL,Heroic shoulders!
2104,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: Alfred Noyes, _At the Sign of the Golden Shoe_.]"
2105,THE MORTAL COIL,
2106,THE MORTAL COIL,It is no wonder that in the last century there has grown up so firm a
2107,THE MORTAL COIL,"belief in the poet's beauty, one reflects, remembering the seraphic face"
2108,THE MORTAL COIL,"of Shelley, the Greek sensuousness of Keats' profile, the romantic fire"
2109,THE MORTAL COIL,of Byron's expression. [Footnote: Browning in his youth must have
2110,THE MORTAL COIL,"encouraged the tradition. See Macready's Diary, in which he describes"
2111,THE MORTAL COIL,"Browning as looking ""more like a youthful poet than any man I ever"
2112,THE MORTAL COIL,"saw.""] Yet it is a belief that must have been sorely tried since the"
2113,THE MORTAL COIL,"invention of the camera has brought the verse-writer's countenance, in"
2114,THE MORTAL COIL,"all its literalness, before the general public. Was it only an accident"
2115,THE MORTAL COIL,that the popularity of current poetry died just as cameras came into
2116,THE MORTAL COIL,existence? How many a potential admirer has been lost by a glance at the
2117,THE MORTAL COIL,"frontispiece in a book of verse! In recent years, faith in soul-made"
2118,THE MORTAL COIL,beauty seems again to have shown itself justified. Likenesses of Rupert
2119,THE MORTAL COIL,"Brooke, with his ""angel air,"" [Footnote: See W. W. Gibson, _Rupert"
2120,THE MORTAL COIL,"Brooke_.] of Alan Seeger, and of Joyce Kilmer in his undergraduate"
2121,THE MORTAL COIL,"days, are perhaps as beautiful as any the romantic period could afford."
2122,THE MORTAL COIL,Still the young enthusiast of the present day should be warned not to be
2123,THE MORTAL COIL,"led astray by wolves in sheep's clothing, for the spurious claimant of"
2124,THE MORTAL COIL,the laurel is learning to employ all the devices of the art photographer
2125,THE MORTAL COIL,to obscure and transform his unaesthetic visage.
2126,THE MORTAL COIL,
2127,THE MORTAL COIL,We have implied that insistence upon the artist's beauty arose with the
2128,THE MORTAL COIL,"romantic movement, but a statement to that effect would have to be made"
2129,THE MORTAL COIL,with reservations. The eighteenth century was by no means without such a
2130,THE MORTAL COIL,"conception, as the satires of that period testify, being full of"
2131,THE MORTAL COIL,"allusions to poetasters' physical defects, with the obvious implication"
2132,THE MORTAL COIL,"that they are indicative of spiritual deformity, and of literary"
2133,THE MORTAL COIL,"sterility. Then, from within the romantic movement itself, a critic"
2134,THE MORTAL COIL,might exhume verse indicating that faith in the beautiful singer was by
2135,THE MORTAL COIL,"no means universal;--that, on the other hand, the interestingly ugly"
2136,THE MORTAL COIL,"bard enjoyed considerable vogue. He would find, for example, Moore's"
2137,THE MORTAL COIL,"_Lines on a Squinting Poetess_, and Praed's _The Talented Man_. In the"
2138,THE MORTAL COIL,"latter verses the speaker says of her literary fancy,"
2139,THE MORTAL COIL,
2140,THE MORTAL COIL,"He's hideous, I own it; but fame, Love,"
2141,THE MORTAL COIL,Is all that these eyes can adore.
2142,THE MORTAL COIL,"He's lame,--but Lord Byron was lame, Love,"
2143,THE MORTAL COIL,"And dumpy, but so is Tom Moore."
2144,THE MORTAL COIL,
2145,THE MORTAL COIL,"Still, rightly interpreted, such verse on poetasters is quite in line"
2146,THE MORTAL COIL,"with the poet's conviction that beauty and genius are inseparable. So,"
2147,THE MORTAL COIL,"likewise, is the more recent verse of Edgar Lee Masters, giving us the"
2148,THE MORTAL COIL,"brutal self-portrait of Minerva Jones, the poetess of Spoon River,"
2149,THE MORTAL COIL,
2150,THE MORTAL COIL,"Hooted at, jeered at by the Yahoos of the street"
2151,THE MORTAL COIL,"For my heavy body, cock eye, and rolling walk,"
2152,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _Spoon River Anthology_.]
2153,THE MORTAL COIL,
2154,THE MORTAL COIL,"for she is only a would-be poet, and the cry, ""I yearned so for beauty!"""
2155,THE MORTAL COIL,"of her spirit, baffled by its embodiment, is almost insupportable."
2156,THE MORTAL COIL,
2157,THE MORTAL COIL,"Walt Whitman alludes to his face as ""the heart's geography map,"" and"

2161,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _Out from Behind This Mask_.]
2162,THE MORTAL COIL,
2163,THE MORTAL COIL,but one needs specific instructions for interpretation of the poetic
2164,THE MORTAL COIL,topography to which Whitman alludes. What are the poet's distinguishing
2165,THE MORTAL COIL,features?
2166,THE MORTAL COIL,
2167,THE MORTAL COIL,"Meditating on the subject, one finds his irreverent thoughts inevitably"
2168,THE MORTAL COIL,"wandering to hair, but in verse taken up with hirsute descriptions,"
2169,THE MORTAL COIL,there is a false note. It makes itself felt in Mrs. Browning's picture
2170,THE MORTAL COIL,"of Keats,"
2171,THE MORTAL COIL,
2172,THE MORTAL COIL,"The real Adonis, with the hymeneal"

2185,THE MORTAL COIL,"Metta Fuller, _Lines to a Poetess_ (1851).] Someone has pointed out"
2186,THE MORTAL COIL,that decadent poetry is always distinguished by over-insistence upon the
2187,THE MORTAL COIL,"heroine's hair, and surely sentimental verse on poets is marked by the"
2188,THE MORTAL COIL,"same defect. Hair is doubtless essential to poetic beauty, but the"

2194,THE MORTAL COIL,"_Tales of the Mermeid Inn_.] poets invariably possess, but the less"
2195,THE MORTAL COIL,phrenological aspect of their beauty is more stressed. The
2196,THE MORTAL COIL,"differentiating mark of the singer's face is a certain luminous quality,"
2197,THE MORTAL COIL,as of the soul shining through. Lamb noticed this peculiarity of
2198,THE MORTAL COIL,"Coleridge, declaring, ""His face when he repeats his verses hath its"
2199,THE MORTAL COIL,"ancient glory; an archangel a little damaged."" [Footnote: E. V. Lucas,"
2200,THE MORTAL COIL,"_The Life of Charles Lamb_, Vol. I., p. 500.] Francis Thompson was"
2201,THE MORTAL COIL,especially struck by this phenomenon. In lines _To a Poet Breaking

2233,THE MORTAL COIL,one feels the aesthetic possibilities of an abstracted expression. But
2234,THE MORTAL COIL,Mrs. Browning fails to achieve a happy effect. When she informs us of a
2235,THE MORTAL COIL,fictitious poet that
2236,THE MORTAL COIL,
2237,THE MORTAL COIL,His steadfast eye burnt inwardly
2238,THE MORTAL COIL,"As burning out his soul,"
2239,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: '_The Poet's Vow_.]
2240,THE MORTAL COIL,
2241,THE MORTAL COIL,we feel uneasily that someone should rouse him from his revery before
2242,THE MORTAL COIL,serious damage is done.
2243,THE MORTAL COIL,
2244,THE MORTAL COIL,The idealistic poet weans his eyes from their pragmatic character in
2245,THE MORTAL COIL,"varying degree. Wordsworth, in poetic mood, seems to have kept them half"
2246,THE MORTAL COIL,"closed.[Footnote: See _A Poet's Epitaph_, and _Sonnet: Most Sweet"
2247,THE MORTAL COIL,it is with Unuplifted Eyes_.] Mrs. Browning notes his
2248,THE MORTAL COIL,
2249,THE MORTAL COIL,"Humble-lidded eyes, as one inclined"
2250,THE MORTAL COIL,Before the sovran-thought of his own mind.
2251,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _On a Portrait of Wordsworth_.]
2252,THE MORTAL COIL,
2253,THE MORTAL COIL,"Clough, also, impressed his poetic brothers by ""his bewildered look, and"
2254,THE MORTAL COIL,"his half-closed eyes."" [Footnote: The quotation is by Longfellow. See J."
2255,THE MORTAL COIL,"I. Osborne, _Arthur Hugh Clough_.]"
2256,THE MORTAL COIL,
2257,THE MORTAL COIL,"But the poet sometimes goes farther, making it his ideal to"
2258,THE MORTAL COIL,
2259,THE MORTAL COIL,"See, no longer blinded with his eyes,"
2260,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: See Rupert Brooke, _Not With Vain Tears_.]"
2261,THE MORTAL COIL,
2262,THE MORTAL COIL,and may thus conceive of the master-poet as necessarily blind. Milton's
2263,THE MORTAL COIL,"noble lines on blindness in _Samson Agonistes_ have had much to do,"
2264,THE MORTAL COIL,"undoubtedly, with the conceptions of later poets. Though blindness is"
2265,THE MORTAL COIL,"seldom extended to other than actual poets, within the confines of verse"
2266,THE MORTAL COIL,"having such a poet as subject it is referred to, often, as a partial"
2267,THE MORTAL COIL,"explanation of genius. Thus Gray says of Milton,"
2268,THE MORTAL COIL,
2269,THE MORTAL COIL,"The living throne, the sapphire blaze"
2270,THE MORTAL COIL,Where angels tremble while they gaze
2271,THE MORTAL COIL,"He saw, but blasted with excess of light,"
2272,THE MORTAL COIL,"Closed his eyes in endless night,"
2273,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _Progress of Poesy_.]
2274,THE MORTAL COIL,
2275,THE MORTAL COIL,and most other poems on Milton follow this fancy.[Footnote: See John
2276,THE MORTAL COIL,"Hughes, _To the Memory of Milton_; William Lisle Bowles, _Milton in"
2277,THE MORTAL COIL,"Age_; Bulwer Lytton, _Milton_; W. H. Burleigh, _The Lesson_; R. C."
2278,THE MORTAL COIL,"Robbins, _Milton_.] There is a good deal of verse on P. B. Marston,"
2279,THE MORTAL COIL,"also, concurring with Rossetti's assertion that we may"
2280,THE MORTAL COIL,
2281,THE MORTAL COIL,By the darkness of thine eyes discern
2282,THE MORTAL COIL,How piercing was the light within thy soul.
2283,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: See Rossetti, _P. B. Marston_; Swinburne,"
2284,THE MORTAL COIL,"_Transfiguration, Marston, Light_; Watts-Dunton, _A Grave by the"
2285,THE MORTAL COIL,Sea_.]
2286,THE MORTAL COIL,
2287,THE MORTAL COIL,"Then, pre-eminently, verse on Homer is characterized by such an"
2288,THE MORTAL COIL,"assertion as that of Keats,"
2289,THE MORTAL COIL,
2290,THE MORTAL COIL,There is a triple sight in blindness keen.
2291,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: See Keats, _Sonnet on Homer_, Landor, _Homer, Laertes,"

2293,THE MORTAL COIL,
2294,THE MORTAL COIL,"Though the conception is not found extensively in other types of verse,"
2295,THE MORTAL COIL,"one finds an admirer apostrophizing Wordsworth,"
2296,THE MORTAL COIL,
2297,THE MORTAL COIL,"Thou that, when first my quickened ear"
2298,THE MORTAL COIL,"Thy deeper harmonies might hear,"
2299,THE MORTAL COIL,"I imaged to myself as old and blind,"
2300,THE MORTAL COIL,"For so were Milton and Maeonides,"
2301,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: Wm. W. Lord, _Wordsworth_ (1845).]"
2302,THE MORTAL COIL,
2303,THE MORTAL COIL,"and at least one American writer, Richard Gilder, ascribes blindness to"
2304,THE MORTAL COIL,"his imaginary artists.[Footnote: See _The Blind Poet_, and _Lost_.  See"
2305,THE MORTAL COIL,also Francis Carlin _Blind O'Cahan_ (1918.)]
2306,THE MORTAL COIL,
2307,THE MORTAL COIL,"But the old, inescapable contradiction in aesthetic philosophy crops up"
2308,THE MORTAL COIL,"here. The poet is concerned only with ideal beauty, yet the way to it,"
2309,THE MORTAL COIL,"for him, must be through sensuous beauty. So, as opposed to the picture"
2310,THE MORTAL COIL,"of the singer blind to his surroundings, we have the opposite"
2311,THE MORTAL COIL,picture--that of a singer with every sense visibly alert. At the very
2312,THE MORTAL COIL,"beginning of a narrative and descriptive poem, the reader can generally"
2313,THE MORTAL COIL,distinguish between the idealistic and the sensuous singer. The more
2314,THE MORTAL COIL,spiritually minded poet is usually characterized as blond. The natural
2315,THE MORTAL COIL,tendency to couple a pure complexion and immaculate thoughts is surely
2316,THE MORTAL COIL,"aided, here, by portraits of Shelley, and of Milton in his youth. The"
2317,THE MORTAL COIL,"brunette poet, on the other hand, is perforce a member of the fleshly"
2318,THE MORTAL COIL,school. The two types are clearly differentiated in Bulwer Lytton's
2319,THE MORTAL COIL,_Dispute of the Poets_. The spiritual one
2320,THE MORTAL COIL,
2321,THE MORTAL COIL,"Lifted the azure light of earnest eyes,"
2322,THE MORTAL COIL,
2323,THE MORTAL COIL,"but his brother,"
2324,THE MORTAL COIL,
2325,THE MORTAL COIL,The one with brighter hues and darker curls
2326,THE MORTAL COIL,"Clustering and purple as the fruit of the vine,"
2327,THE MORTAL COIL,Seemed like that Summer-Idol of rich life
2328,THE MORTAL COIL,"Whom sensuous Greece, inebriate with delight"
2329,THE MORTAL COIL,From orient myth and symbol-worship wrought.
2330,THE MORTAL COIL,
2331,THE MORTAL COIL,"The decadents favor swarthy poets, and, in describing their features,"
2332,THE MORTAL COIL,seize upon the most expressive symbols of sensuality. Thus the hero of
2333,THE MORTAL COIL,John Davidson's _Ballad in Blank Verse on the Making of a Poet_ is
2334,THE MORTAL COIL,
2335,THE MORTAL COIL,A youth whose sultry eyes
2336,THE MORTAL COIL,Bold brow and wanton mouth were not all lust.
2337,THE MORTAL COIL,
2338,THE MORTAL COIL,"But even the idealistic poet, if he be not one-sided, must have sensuous"
2339,THE MORTAL COIL,"features, as Browning conceives him. We are told of Sordello,"
2340,THE MORTAL COIL,
2341,THE MORTAL COIL,Yourselves shall trace
2342,THE MORTAL COIL,"(The delicate nostril swerving wide and fine,"
2343,THE MORTAL COIL,"A sharp and restless lip, so well combine"
2344,THE MORTAL COIL,With that calm brow) a soul fit to receive
2345,THE MORTAL COIL,Delight at every sense; you can believe
2346,THE MORTAL COIL,Sordello foremost in the regal class
2347,THE MORTAL COIL,Nature has broadly severed from her mass
2348,THE MORTAL COIL,"Of men, and framed for pleasure..."
2349,THE MORTAL COIL,*       *       *       *       *
2350,THE MORTAL COIL,You recognize at once the finer dress
2351,THE MORTAL COIL,Of flesh that amply lets in loveliness
2352,THE MORTAL COIL,At eye and ear.
2353,THE MORTAL COIL,
2354,THE MORTAL COIL,Perhaps it is with the idea that the flesh may be shuffled off the more
2355,THE MORTAL COIL,"easily that poets are given ""barely enough body to imprison the soul,"""
2356,THE MORTAL COIL,as Mrs. Browning's biographer says of her. [Footnote: Mrs. Anna B.
2357,THE MORTAL COIL,"Jameson. George Stillman Milliard says of Mrs. Browning, ""I have never"
2358,THE MORTAL COIL,seen a human frame which seemed so nearly a transparent veil for a
2359,THE MORTAL COIL,"celestial and immortal spirit."" Shelley, Keats, Clough and Swinburne"
2360,THE MORTAL COIL,undoubtedly helped to strengthen the tradition.] The imaginary bard is
2361,THE MORTAL COIL,"so inevitably slender that allusion to ""the poet's frame"" needs no"
2362,THE MORTAL COIL,"further description. Yet, once more, the poet may seem to be"
2363,THE MORTAL COIL,deliberately blinding himself to the facts. What of the father of
2364,THE MORTAL COIL,"English song, who, in the _Canterbury Tales_, is described by the"
2365,THE MORTAL COIL,"burly host,"
2366,THE MORTAL COIL,
2367,THE MORTAL COIL,He in the waast is shape as wel as I;
2368,THE MORTAL COIL,This were a popet in an arm tenbrace
2369,THE MORTAL COIL,"For any woman, smal and fair of face?"
2370,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _Prologue to Sir  Thopas_.]
2371,THE MORTAL COIL,
2372,THE MORTAL COIL,"Even here, however, one can trace the modern aesthetic aversion to fat."
2373,THE MORTAL COIL,Chaucer undoubtedly took sly pleasure in stressing his difference from
2374,THE MORTAL COIL,"the current conception of the poet, which was typified so well by the"
2375,THE MORTAL COIL,"handsome young squire, who"
2376,THE MORTAL COIL,
2377,THE MORTAL COIL,"Coude songes make, and wel endyte."
2378,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _Prologue_.]
2379,THE MORTAL COIL,
2380,THE MORTAL COIL,"Such, at least, is the interpretation of Percy Mackaye, who in his play,"
2381,THE MORTAL COIL,"_The Canterbury Pilgrims_, derives the heartiest enjoyment from"
2382,THE MORTAL COIL,Chaucer's woe lest his avoirdupois may affect Madame Eglantine
2383,THE MORTAL COIL,"unfavorably. The modern English poet who is oppressed by too, too solid"
2384,THE MORTAL COIL,flesh is inclined to follow Chaucer's precedent and take it
2385,THE MORTAL COIL,"philosophically. James Thomson allowed the stanza about himself,"
2386,THE MORTAL COIL,"interpolated by his friends into the _Castle of Indolence_, to"
2387,THE MORTAL COIL,"remain, though it begins with the line,"
2388,THE MORTAL COIL,
2389,THE MORTAL COIL,"A bard here dwelt, more fat than bard beseems."
2390,THE MORTAL COIL,
2391,THE MORTAL COIL,"And in these days, the sentimental reader is shocked by Joyce Kilmer's"
2392,THE MORTAL COIL,"callous assertion, ""I am fat and gross.... In my youth I was slightly"
2393,THE MORTAL COIL,"decorative. But now I drink beer instead of writing about absinthe."""
2394,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: Letter to Father Daly, November, 1914.]"
2395,THE MORTAL COIL,
2396,THE MORTAL COIL,Possibly it would not be unreasonable to take difference in weight as
2397,THE MORTAL COIL,another distinction between idealistic and sensuous poets. Of one recent
2398,THE MORTAL COIL,"realistic poet it is recorded, ""How a poet could _not_ be a glorious"
2399,THE MORTAL COIL,"eater, he said he could not see, for the poet was happier than other"
2400,THE MORTAL COIL,"men, by reason of his acuter senses."" [Footnote: Richard Le Gallienne,"
2401,THE MORTAL COIL,"_Joyce Kilmer_.] As a rule, however, decadent and spiritual poets alike"
2402,THE MORTAL COIL,"shrink from the thought of grossness, in spite of the fact that Joyce"
2403,THE MORTAL COIL,"Kilmer was able to win his wager, ""I will write a poem about a"
2404,THE MORTAL COIL,"delicatessen shop. It will be a high-brow poem. It will be liked."""
2405,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: Robert Cortez Holliday, _Memoir of Joyce Kilmer_, p. 62.] Of"
2406,THE MORTAL COIL,course Keats accustomed the public to the idea that there are aesthetic
2407,THE MORTAL COIL,"distinctions in the sense of taste, but throughout the last century the"
2408,THE MORTAL COIL,idea of a poet enjoying solid food was an anomaly. Whitman's
2409,THE MORTAL COIL,"proclamation of himself, ""Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating and"
2410,THE MORTAL COIL,"drinking and breeding"" [Footnote: _Song of Myself_.] automatically shut"
2411,THE MORTAL COIL,"him off, in the minds of his contemporaries, from consideration as a"
2412,THE MORTAL COIL,poet.
2413,THE MORTAL COIL,
2414,THE MORTAL COIL,It is a nice question just how far a poet may go in ignoring the demands
2415,THE MORTAL COIL,of the flesh. Shelley's friends record that his indifference reached the
2416,THE MORTAL COIL,"stage of forgetting, for days at a time, that he was in a body at all."
2417,THE MORTAL COIL,"Even more extreme was the attitude of Poe, as it is presented at length"
2418,THE MORTAL COIL,"in Olive Dargan's drama, _The Poet_. So cordial is his detestation"
2419,THE MORTAL COIL,"of food and bed that he not only eschews them himself, but withholds"
2420,THE MORTAL COIL,"them from his wife, driving the poor woman to a lingering death from"
2421,THE MORTAL COIL,"tuberculosis, while he himself succumbs to delirium tremens. In fact,"
2422,THE MORTAL COIL,"excessive abstemiousness, fostering digestive disorders, has been"
2423,THE MORTAL COIL,alleged to be the secret of the copious melancholy verse in the last
2424,THE MORTAL COIL,"century. It is not the ill-nourished poet, however, but enemies of the"
2425,THE MORTAL COIL,"melancholy type of verse, who offer this explanation. Thus Walt Whitman"
2426,THE MORTAL COIL,does not hesitate to write poetry on the effect of his digestive
2427,THE MORTAL COIL,"disorders upon his gift, [Footnote: See _As I Sit Writing Here_.]"
2428,THE MORTAL COIL,and George Meredith lays the weakness of _Manfred_ to the fact that
2429,THE MORTAL COIL,it was
2430,THE MORTAL COIL,
2431,THE MORTAL COIL,Projected from the bilious Childe.
2432,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: George Meredith, _Manfred_.]"
2433,THE MORTAL COIL,
2434,THE MORTAL COIL,But to all conscious of possessing poetical temperament in company with
2435,THE MORTAL COIL,"emaciation, the explanation has seemed intolerably sordid."
2436,THE MORTAL COIL,
2437,THE MORTAL COIL,"To be sure, the unhealthy poet is not ubiquitous. Wordsworth's _Prelude_"
2438,THE MORTAL COIL,describes a life of exuberant physical energy. Walt Whitman's position
2439,THE MORTAL COIL,"we have quoted, and after him came a number of American writers,"
2440,THE MORTAL COIL,assigning a football physique to their heroes. J. G. Holland's poet was
2441,THE MORTAL COIL,"the superior of his comrades when brawn as well as brain, contended."
2442,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: _Kathrina_.] William Henry Burleigh, also, described his"
2443,THE MORTAL COIL,favorite poet as
2444,THE MORTAL COIL,
2445,THE MORTAL COIL,A man who measured six feet four:
2446,THE MORTAL COIL,"Broad were his shoulders, ample was his chest,"
2447,THE MORTAL COIL,"Compact his frame, his muscles of the best."
2448,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _A Portrait_.]
2449,THE MORTAL COIL,
2450,THE MORTAL COIL,"With the recent revival of interest in Whitman, the brawny bard has"
2451,THE MORTAL COIL,"again come into favor in certain quarters. Joyce Kilmer, as has been"
2452,THE MORTAL COIL,"noted, was his strongest advocate, inveighing against weakly"
2453,THE MORTAL COIL,"verse-writers,"
2454,THE MORTAL COIL,
2455,THE MORTAL COIL,"A heavy handed blow, I think,"
2456,THE MORTAL COIL,Would make your veins drip scented ink.
2457,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _To Certain Poets_.]
2458,THE MORTAL COIL,
2459,THE MORTAL COIL,But the poet hero of the Harold Bell Wright type is receiving his share
2460,THE MORTAL COIL,"of ridicule, as well as praise, at present. A farce, _Fame and the"
2461,THE MORTAL COIL,"Poet_, by Lord Dunsany, advertises the adulation by feminine readers"
2462,THE MORTAL COIL,"resulting from a poet's pose as a ""man's man."" And Ezra Pound, who began"
2463,THE MORTAL COIL,"his career as an exemplar of virility,[Footnote: See _The Revolt"
2464,THE MORTAL COIL,against the Crepuscular Spirit in Modern Poetry_.] finds himself
2465,THE MORTAL COIL,"unable to keep up the pose, and so resorts to the complaint,"
2466,THE MORTAL COIL,
2467,THE MORTAL COIL,"We are compared to that sort of person,"
2468,THE MORTAL COIL,Who wanders about announcing his sex
2469,THE MORTAL COIL,As if he had just discovered it.
2470,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _The Condolence_.]
2471,THE MORTAL COIL,
2472,THE MORTAL COIL,The most sensible argument offered by the advocate of better health in
2473,THE MORTAL COIL,"poets is made by the chronic invalid, Mrs. Browning. She causes Aurora"
2474,THE MORTAL COIL,"Leigh's cousin Romney to argue,"
2475,THE MORTAL COIL,
2476,THE MORTAL COIL,"Reflect; if art be in truth the higher life,"
2477,THE MORTAL COIL,You need the lower life to stand upon
2478,THE MORTAL COIL,In order to reach up unto that higher;
2479,THE MORTAL COIL,And none can stand a tip-toe in that place
2480,THE MORTAL COIL,He cannot stand in with two stable feet.
2481,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: _Aurora Leigh_. See also the letter to Robert Browning,"
2482,THE MORTAL COIL,"May 6, 1845.]"
2483,THE MORTAL COIL,
2484,THE MORTAL COIL,Mrs. Browning's theory is not out of key with a professedly scientific
2485,THE MORTAL COIL,"account of genius, not unpopular nowadays, which represents art as the"
2486,THE MORTAL COIL,"result of excess vitality. [Footnote: See R. C. Robbins, _Michael"
2487,THE MORTAL COIL,Angelo_ (1904).]
2488,THE MORTAL COIL,
2489,THE MORTAL COIL,"Yet, on the whole, the frail poet still holds his own; how securely is"
2490,THE MORTAL COIL,"illustrated by the familiarity of the idea as applied to other artists,"
2491,THE MORTAL COIL,outside the domain of poetry. It is noteworthy that in a recent book of
2492,THE MORTAL COIL,"essays by the painter, Birge Harrison, one runs across the contention:"
2493,THE MORTAL COIL,
2494,THE MORTAL COIL,"In fact, as a noted painter once said to me: These"
2495,THE MORTAL COIL,"semi-invalids neither need nor deserve our commiseration,"
2496,THE MORTAL COIL,for in reality the beggars have the advantage
2497,THE MORTAL COIL,of us. _Their_ nerves are always sensitive and keyed
2498,THE MORTAL COIL,"to pitch, while we husky chaps have to flog ours up to"
2499,THE MORTAL COIL,the point. We must dig painfully through the outer
2500,THE MORTAL COIL,"layers of flesh before we can get at the spirit, while the"
2501,THE MORTAL COIL,invalids are all spirit.
2502,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: From _Landscape Painters_, p. 184.]"
2503,THE MORTAL COIL,
2504,THE MORTAL COIL,That such a belief had no lack of support from facts in the last
2505,THE MORTAL COIL,"century, is apparent merely from naming over the chief poets. Coleridge,"
2506,THE MORTAL COIL,"Byron, Shelley, Keats, Mrs. Browning, Rossetti, all publish their"
2507,THE MORTAL COIL,"ill-health through their verse. Even Browning, in whose verse, if"
2508,THE MORTAL COIL,"anywhere, one would expect to find the virile poet, shows Sordello"
2509,THE MORTAL COIL,turned to poetry by the fact of his physical weakness.[Footnote: So
2510,THE MORTAL COIL,"nearly ubiquitous has ill-health been among modern poets, that Max"
2511,THE MORTAL COIL,"Nordau, in his widely read indictment of art, _Degeneration_, was"
2512,THE MORTAL COIL,able to make out a plausible case for his theory that genius is a
2513,THE MORTAL COIL,disease which is always accompanied by physical stigmata.]
2514,THE MORTAL COIL,
2515,THE MORTAL COIL,"Obviously, if certain invalids possess a short-cut to their souls, as"
2516,THE MORTAL COIL,"Birge Harrison suggests, the nature of their complaint must be"
2517,THE MORTAL COIL,significant. A jumping toothache would hardly be an advantage to a
2518,THE MORTAL COIL,sufferer in turning his thoughts to poesy. Since verse writers recoil
2519,THE MORTAL COIL,"from the suggestion that dyspepsia is the name of their complaint, let"
2520,THE MORTAL COIL,us ask them to explain its real character to us. To take one of our
2521,THE MORTAL COIL,"earliest examples, what is the malady of William Lisles Bowles' poet, of"
2522,THE MORTAL COIL,"whom we learn,"
2523,THE MORTAL COIL,
2524,THE MORTAL COIL,Too long had sickness left her pining trace
2525,THE MORTAL COIL,With slow still touch on each decaying grace;
2526,THE MORTAL COIL,Untimely sorrow marked his thoughtful mien;
2527,THE MORTAL COIL,Despair upon his languid smile was seen.
2528,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _Monody on Henry Headley_.]
2529,THE MORTAL COIL,
2530,THE MORTAL COIL,"We can never know. But with Shelley, it becomes evident that"
2531,THE MORTAL COIL,tuberculosis is the typical poet's complaint. Shelley was convinced that
2532,THE MORTAL COIL,he himself was destined to die of it. The irreverent Hogg records that
2533,THE MORTAL COIL,"Shelley was also afraid of death from elephantiasis, [Footnote: T. J."
2534,THE MORTAL COIL,"Hogg, _Life of Shelley_, p. 458.] but he keeps that affliction out"
2535,THE MORTAL COIL,"of his verse. So early as the composition of the _Revolt of Islam,_"
2536,THE MORTAL COIL,"Shelley tells us of himself, in the introduction,"
2537,THE MORTAL COIL,
2538,THE MORTAL COIL,"Death and love are yet contending for their prey,"
2539,THE MORTAL COIL,
2540,THE MORTAL COIL,and in _Adonais_ he appears as
2541,THE MORTAL COIL,
2542,THE MORTAL COIL,A power
2543,THE MORTAL COIL,Girt round with weakness.
2544,THE MORTAL COIL,*       *       *       *       *
2545,THE MORTAL COIL,A light spear ...
2546,THE MORTAL COIL,"Vibrated, as the everbearing heart"
2547,THE MORTAL COIL,Shook the weak hand that grasped it.
2548,THE MORTAL COIL,
2549,THE MORTAL COIL,"Shelley's imaginary poet, Lionel, gains in poetical sensibility as"
2550,THE MORTAL COIL,consumption saps his strength:
2551,THE MORTAL COIL,
2552,THE MORTAL COIL,"You might see his colour come and go,"
2553,THE MORTAL COIL,And the softest strain of music made
2554,THE MORTAL COIL,"Sweet smiles, yet sad, arise and fade"
2555,THE MORTAL COIL,Amid the dew of his tender eyes;
2556,THE MORTAL COIL,And the breath with intermitting flow
2557,THE MORTAL COIL,Made his pale lips quiver and part.

2559,THE MORTAL COIL,
2560,THE MORTAL COIL,"The deaths from tuberculosis of Kirke White [Footnote: See Kirke White,"
2561,THE MORTAL COIL,"_Sonnet to Consumption_.] and of Keats, added to Shelley's verse, so"
2562,THE MORTAL COIL,affected the imagination of succeeding poets that for a time the cough
2563,THE MORTAL COIL,became almost ubiquitous in verse. In major poetry it appears for the
2564,THE MORTAL COIL,"last time in Tennyson's _The Brook_, where the young poet hastens to"
2565,THE MORTAL COIL,"Italy, ""too late,"" but in American verse it continued to rack the frame"
2566,THE MORTAL COIL,of geniuses till the germ theory robbed it of romance and the
2567,THE MORTAL COIL,anti-tuberculosis campaign drove it out of existence.
2568,THE MORTAL COIL,
2569,THE MORTAL COIL,"Without the aid of physical causes, the exquisite sensitiveness of the"
2570,THE MORTAL COIL,poet's spirit is sometimes regarded as enough to produce illness. Thus
2571,THE MORTAL COIL,Alexander Smith explains his sickly hero:
2572,THE MORTAL COIL,
2573,THE MORTAL COIL,More tremulous
2574,THE MORTAL COIL,Than the soft star that in the azure East
2575,THE MORTAL COIL,Trembles with pity o'er bright bleeding day
2576,THE MORTAL COIL,Was his frail soul.
2577,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _A Life Drama_.]
2578,THE MORTAL COIL,
2579,THE MORTAL COIL,"Arnold, likewise, in _Thyrsis_, follows the poetic tradition in"
2580,THE MORTAL COIL,thus vaguely accounting for Clough's death:
2581,THE MORTAL COIL,
2582,THE MORTAL COIL,Some life of men unblest
2583,THE MORTAL COIL,"He knew, which made him droop, and filled his head."
2584,THE MORTAL COIL,"He went, his piping took a troubled sound"
2585,THE MORTAL COIL,Of storms that rage outside our happy ground.
2586,THE MORTAL COIL,He could not wait their passing; he is dead.
2587,THE MORTAL COIL,
2588,THE MORTAL COIL,"In addition, the intense application that genius demands leaves its mark"
2589,THE MORTAL COIL,upon the body. Recognition of this fact has doubtless been aided by
2590,THE MORTAL COIL,"Dante's portrait, which Wilde has repainted in verse:"
2591,THE MORTAL COIL,
2592,THE MORTAL COIL,"The calm, white brow, as calm as earliest morn,"
2593,THE MORTAL COIL,"The eyes that flashed with passionate love and scorn,"
2594,THE MORTAL COIL,"The lips that sang of Heaven and of Hell,"
2595,THE MORTAL COIL,"The almond face that Giotto drew so well,"
2596,THE MORTAL COIL,The weary face of Dante.[Footnote: _Ravenna._]
2597,THE MORTAL COIL,
2598,THE MORTAL COIL,Rossetti repeats the tradition that the composition of the
2599,THE MORTAL COIL,_Inferno_ so preyed upon Dante that the superstitious believed that
2600,THE MORTAL COIL,"he had actually visited Hades and whispered to one another,"
2601,THE MORTAL COIL,
2602,THE MORTAL COIL,"Behold him, how Hell's reek"
2603,THE MORTAL COIL,Has crisped his beard and singed his cheek.
2604,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _Dante at Verona._]
2605,THE MORTAL COIL,
2606,THE MORTAL COIL,A similar note is in Francis Thompson's description of Coventry Patmore:
2607,THE MORTAL COIL,
2608,THE MORTAL COIL,And lo! that hair is blanched with travel-heats of hell.
2609,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _A Captain of Song._]
2610,THE MORTAL COIL,
2611,THE MORTAL COIL,In this connection one thinks at once of Shelley's prematurely graying
2612,THE MORTAL COIL,"hair, reflected in description of his heroes harried by their"
2613,THE MORTAL COIL,genius into ill health. Prince Athanase is
2614,THE MORTAL COIL,
2615,THE MORTAL COIL,A youth who as with toil and travel
2616,THE MORTAL COIL,Had grown quite weak and gray before his time.

2618,THE MORTAL COIL,
2619,THE MORTAL COIL,"In _Alastor_, too, we see the hero wasting away until"
2620,THE MORTAL COIL,
2621,THE MORTAL COIL,"His limbs were lean; his scattered hair,"
2622,THE MORTAL COIL,"Sered by the autumn of strange suffering,"
2623,THE MORTAL COIL,Sung dirges in the wind: his listless hand
2624,THE MORTAL COIL,Hung like dead bone within his withered skin;
2625,THE MORTAL COIL,"Life, and the lustre that consumed it, shone"
2626,THE MORTAL COIL,As in a furnace burning secretly
2627,THE MORTAL COIL,From his dark eyes alone.
2628,THE MORTAL COIL,
2629,THE MORTAL COIL,The likeness of Sordello to Shelley [Footnote: Browning himself pointed
2630,THE MORTAL COIL,"out a similarity between them, in the opening of Book I.] is marked in"
2631,THE MORTAL COIL,"the ravages of his genius upon his flesh, so that at the climax of the"
2632,THE MORTAL COIL,"poem he, though still a young man, is gray and haggard and fragile."
2633,THE MORTAL COIL,
2634,THE MORTAL COIL,"Though ill-health is a handicap to him, the poet's subjection to the"
2635,THE MORTAL COIL,"mutability that governs the mundane sphere is less important, some"
2636,THE MORTAL COIL,"persons would declare, in the matter of beauty and health than in the"
2637,THE MORTAL COIL,matter of sex. Can a poetic spirit overcome the calamity of being cast
2638,THE MORTAL COIL,by Fate into the body of a woman?
2639,THE MORTAL COIL,
2640,THE MORTAL COIL,As the battle of feminism dragged its bloody way through all fields of
2641,THE MORTAL COIL,"endeavor in the last century, it of course has left its traces in the"
2642,THE MORTAL COIL,"realm of poetry. But here the casualties appear to be light,--in fact,"
2643,THE MORTAL COIL,it is a disappointment to the suffragist to find most of the blows
2644,THE MORTAL COIL,"struck by the female aspirant for glory, with but few efforts to parry"
2645,THE MORTAL COIL,"them on the part of the male contingent. Furthermore, in verse concerned"
2646,THE MORTAL COIL,"with specific woman poets, men have not failed to give them their due,"
2647,THE MORTAL COIL,"or more. From Miriam [Footnote: See Barry Cornwall, _Miriam_.] and"
2648,THE MORTAL COIL,"Sappho, [Footnote: Southey, _Sappho_; Freneau, _Monument of Phaon_;"

2652,THE MORTAL COIL,"long list of nineteenth century female poets--Mrs. Browning, [Footnote:"

2662,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: Richard Watson Gilder, _H_. _H_.] Emma Lazarus [Footnote:"
2663,THE MORTAL COIL,"_Ibid_., _To E. Lazarus_.]--one finds woman the subject of complimentary"
2664,THE MORTAL COIL,"verse from their brothers. There is nothing to complain of here, we"
2665,THE MORTAL COIL,"should say at first, and yet, in the unreserved praise given to their"
2666,THE MORTAL COIL,greatest is a note that irritates the feminists. For men have made it
2667,THE MORTAL COIL,"plain that Sappho was not like other women; it is the ""virility"" of her"
2668,THE MORTAL COIL,style that appeals to them; they have even gone so far as to hail her
2669,THE MORTAL COIL,"""manlike maiden."" [Footnote: Swinburne, _On the Cliffs_.] So the"
2670,THE MORTAL COIL,feminists have been only embittered by their brothers' praise.
2671,THE MORTAL COIL,
2672,THE MORTAL COIL,"As time wears on, writers averse to feminine verse seem to be losing"
2673,THE MORTAL COIL,"thecourage of their convictions. At the end of the eighteenth century,"
2674,THE MORTAL COIL,woman's opponent was not afraid to express himself. Woman writers were
2675,THE MORTAL COIL,"sometimes praised, but it was for one quality alone, the chastity of"
2676,THE MORTAL COIL,"their style. John Hughes [Footnote: See _To the Author of ""A Fatal"
2677,THE MORTAL COIL,"Friendship.""_] and Tom Moore [Footnote: See _To Mrs. Henry Tighe_.] both"
2678,THE MORTAL COIL,deplored the need of such an element in masculine verse. But Moore could
2679,THE MORTAL COIL,"not resist counteracting the effect of his chary praise by a play, _The"
2680,THE MORTAL COIL,"Blue Stocking_, which burlesques the literary pose in women. He seemed"
2681,THE MORTAL COIL,"to feel, also, that he had neatly quelled their poetical aspirations"
2682,THE MORTAL COIL,when he advertised his aversion to marrying a literary woman. [Footnote:
2683,THE MORTAL COIL,See _The Catalogue_. Another of his poems ridiculing poetesses is _The
2684,THE MORTAL COIL,"Squinting Poetess_.] Despite a chivalrous sentimentality, Barry Cornwall"
2685,THE MORTAL COIL,"took his stand with Moore on the point, exhorting women to choose love"
2686,THE MORTAL COIL,rather than a literary career. [Footnote: See _To a Poetess_. More
2687,THE MORTAL COIL,"seriously, Landor offered the same discouragement to his young friend"
2688,THE MORTAL COIL,with poetical tastes. [Footnote: See _To Write as Your Sweet Mother
2689,THE MORTAL COIL,Does_.] On the whole the prevalent view expressed early in the
2690,THE MORTAL COIL,nineteenth century is the considerate one that while women lack a
2691,THE MORTAL COIL,"literary gift, they have, none the less, sweet poetical natures. Bulwer"
2692,THE MORTAL COIL,Lytton phrased the old-fashioned distinction between his hero and
2693,THE MORTAL COIL,"heroine,"
2694,THE MORTAL COIL,
2695,THE MORTAL COIL,In each lay poesy--for woman's heart
2696,THE MORTAL COIL,"Nurses the stream, unsought and oft unseen;"
2697,THE MORTAL COIL,"And if it flow not through the tide of art,"
2698,THE MORTAL COIL,Nor win the glittering daylight--you may ween
2699,THE MORTAL COIL,"It slumbers, but not ceases, and if checked"
2700,THE MORTAL COIL,"The egress of rich words, it flows in thought,"
2701,THE MORTAL COIL,And in its silent mirror doth reflect
2702,THE MORTAL COIL,Whate'er affection to its banks hath brought.
2703,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: Milton.]
2704,THE MORTAL COIL,
2705,THE MORTAL COIL,Yet the poetess has two of the strongest poets of the romantic period on
2706,THE MORTAL COIL,"her side. Wordsworth, in his many allusions to his sister Dorothy,"
2707,THE MORTAL COIL,"appeared to feel her possibilities equal to his own, and in verses on an"
2708,THE MORTAL COIL,"anthology, he offered praise of a more general nature to verse written"
2709,THE MORTAL COIL,by women. [Footnote: See To Lady Mary Lowther.] And beside the sober
2710,THE MORTAL COIL,"judgment of Wordsworth, one may place the unbounded enthusiasm of"
2711,THE MORTAL COIL,"Shelley, who not only praises extravagantly the verse of an individual,"
2712,THE MORTAL COIL,"Emilia Viviani, [Footnote: See the introduction to Epipsychidion.] but"
2713,THE MORTAL COIL,"who also offers us an imaginary poetess of supreme powers,--Cythna, in"
2714,THE MORTAL COIL,_The Revolt of Islam_.
2715,THE MORTAL COIL,
2716,THE MORTAL COIL,It is disappointing to the agitator to find the question dropping out of
2717,THE MORTAL COIL,sight in later verse. In the Victorian period it comes most plainly to
2718,THE MORTAL COIL,"the surface in Browning, and while the exquisite praise of his"
2719,THE MORTAL COIL,
2720,THE MORTAL COIL,"Lyric love, half angel and half bird,"
2721,THE MORTAL COIL,
2722,THE MORTAL COIL,"reveals him a believer in at least sporadic female genius, his position"
2723,THE MORTAL COIL,on the question of championing the entire sex is at least equivocal. In
2724,THE MORTAL COIL,_The Two Poets of Croisic_ he deals with the eighteenth century in
2725,THE MORTAL COIL,"France, where the literary woman came so gloriously into her own."
2726,THE MORTAL COIL,Browning represents a man writing under a feminine pseudonym and winning
2727,THE MORTAL COIL,the admiration of the celebrities of the day--only to have his verse
2728,THE MORTAL COIL,tossed aside as worthless as soon as his sex is revealed. Woman wins by
2729,THE MORTAL COIL,"her charm, seems to be the moral. A hopeful sign, however, is the fact"
2730,THE MORTAL COIL,that of late years one poet produced his best work under a feminine
2731,THE MORTAL COIL,"_nom de plume_, and found it no handicap in obtaining recognition."
2732,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: William Sharp, ""Fiona McLeod.""] If indifference is the"
2733,THE MORTAL COIL,"attitude of the male poet, not so of the woman writer. She insists that"
2734,THE MORTAL COIL,"her work shall redound, not to her own glory, merely, but to that of her"
2735,THE MORTAL COIL,"entire sex as well. For the most worthy presentation of her case, we"
2736,THE MORTAL COIL,"must turn to Mrs. Browning, though the radical feminist is not likely to"
2737,THE MORTAL COIL,"approve of her attitude. ""My secret profession of faith,"" she admitted"
2738,THE MORTAL COIL,"to Robert Browning, ""is--that there is a natural inferiority of mind in"
2739,THE MORTAL COIL,women--of the intellect--not by any means of the moral nature--and that
2740,THE MORTAL COIL,"the history of Art and of genius testifies to this fact openly."""
2741,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: Letter to Robert Browning, July 4, 1845.] Still, despite this"
2742,THE MORTAL COIL,"private surrender to the enemy, Mrs. Browning defends her sex well."
2743,THE MORTAL COIL,
2744,THE MORTAL COIL,"In a short narrative poem, _Mother and Poet_, Mrs. Browning claims"
2745,THE MORTAL COIL,for her heroine the sterner virtues that have been denied her by the
2746,THE MORTAL COIL,"average critic, who assigns woman to sentimental verse as her proper"
2747,THE MORTAL COIL,sphere. Of course her most serious consideration of the problem is to be
2748,THE MORTAL COIL,found in _Aurora Leigh_. She feels that making her imaginary poet a
2749,THE MORTAL COIL,"woman is a departure from tradition, and she strives to justify it. Much"
2750,THE MORTAL COIL,of the debasing adulation and petty criticism heaped upon Aurora must
2751,THE MORTAL COIL,have been taken from Mrs. Browning's own experience. Ignoring
2752,THE MORTAL COIL,"insignificant antagonism to her, Aurora is seriously concerned with the"
2753,THE MORTAL COIL,"charges that the social worker, Romney Leigh, brings against her sex."
2754,THE MORTAL COIL,"Romney declares,"
2755,THE MORTAL COIL,
2756,THE MORTAL COIL,"Women as you are,"
2757,THE MORTAL COIL,"Mere women, personal and passionate,"
2758,THE MORTAL COIL,"You give us doting mothers, and perfect wives,"
2759,THE MORTAL COIL,Sublime Madonnas and enduring saints!
2760,THE MORTAL COIL,"We get no Christ from you,--and verily"
2761,THE MORTAL COIL,"We shall not get a poet, in my mind."
2762,THE MORTAL COIL,
2763,THE MORTAL COIL,Aurora is obliged to acknowledge to herself that Romney is right in
2764,THE MORTAL COIL,charging women with inability to escape from personal considerations.
2765,THE MORTAL COIL,"She confesses,"
2766,THE MORTAL COIL,
2767,THE MORTAL COIL,"We women are too apt to look to one,"
2768,THE MORTAL COIL,Which proves a certain impotence in art.
2769,THE MORTAL COIL,
2770,THE MORTAL COIL,"But in the end, and after much struggling, Aurora wins for her poetry"
2771,THE MORTAL COIL,even Romney's reluctant admiration. Mrs. Browning's implication seems to
2772,THE MORTAL COIL,"be that the intensely ""personal and passionate"" nature of woman is an"
2773,THE MORTAL COIL,"advantage to her, if once she can lift herself from its thraldom,"
2774,THE MORTAL COIL,because it saves her from the danger of dry generalization which assails
2775,THE MORTAL COIL,verse of more masculine temper. [Footnote: For treatment of the question
2776,THE MORTAL COIL,"of the poet's sex in American verse by women, see Emma Lazarus,"
2777,THE MORTAL COIL,"_Echoes_; Olive Dargan, _Ye Who are to Sing_.]"
2778,THE MORTAL COIL,
2779,THE MORTAL COIL,Of only less vital concern to poets than the question of the poet's
2780,THE MORTAL COIL,physical constitution is the problem of his environment. Where will the
2781,THE MORTAL COIL,chains of mortality least hamper his aspiring spirit?
2782,THE MORTAL COIL,
2783,THE MORTAL COIL,"In answer, one is haunted by the line,"
2784,THE MORTAL COIL,
2785,THE MORTAL COIL,I too was born in Arcadia.
2786,THE MORTAL COIL,
2787,THE MORTAL COIL,"Still, this is not the answer that poets would make in all periods. In"
2788,THE MORTAL COIL,"the eighteenth century, for example, though a stereotyped conception of"
2789,THE MORTAL COIL,"the shepherd poet ruled,--as witness the verses of Hughes, [Footnote:"
2790,THE MORTAL COIL,"See _Corydon_.] Collins, [Footnote: See _Selim, or the Shepherd's"
2791,THE MORTAL COIL,"Moral_.] and Thomson,[Footnote: See _Pastoral on the Death of"
2792,THE MORTAL COIL,Daemon_.]--it is obvious that these gentlemen were in no literal
2793,THE MORTAL COIL,sense expressing their views on the poet's habitat. It was hardly
2794,THE MORTAL COIL,necessary for Thomas Hood to parody their efforts in his eclogues giving
2795,THE MORTAL COIL,a broadly realistic turn to shepherds assuming the singing robes.
2796,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: See _Huggins and Duggins_, and _The Forlorn Shepherd's"
2797,THE MORTAL COIL,"Complaint_.] Wherever a personal element enters, as in John Hughes'"
2798,THE MORTAL COIL,"_Letter to a Friend in the Country_, and Sidney Dyer's _A Country"
2799,THE MORTAL COIL,"Walk_, it is apparent that the poet is not indigenous to the soil. He"
2800,THE MORTAL COIL,"is the city gentleman, come out to enjoy a holiday."
2801,THE MORTAL COIL,
2802,THE MORTAL COIL,"With the growth of a romantic conception of nature, the relation of the"
2803,THE MORTAL COIL,"poet to nature becomes, of course, more intimate. But Cowper and Thomson"
2804,THE MORTAL COIL,keep themselves out of their nature poetry to such an extent that it is
2805,THE MORTAL COIL,"hard to tell what their ideal position would be, and not till the"
2806,THE MORTAL COIL,publication of Beattie's _The Minstrel_ do we find a poem in which
2807,THE MORTAL COIL,the poet is nurtured under the influence of a natural scenery. At the
2808,THE MORTAL COIL,very climax of the romantic period the poet is not always bred in the
2809,THE MORTAL COIL,country. We find Byron revealing himself as one who seeks nature only
2810,THE MORTAL COIL,"occasionally, as a mistress in whose novelty resides a good deal of her"
2811,THE MORTAL COIL,"charm. Shelley, too, portrays a poet reared in civilization, but"
2812,THE MORTAL COIL,"escaping to nature. [Footnote: See _Epipsychidion_, and _Alastor_.]"
2813,THE MORTAL COIL,"Still, it is obvious that ever since the time of Burns and Wordsworth,"
2814,THE MORTAL COIL,the idea of a poet nurtured from infancy in nature's bosom has been
2815,THE MORTAL COIL,extremely popular.
2816,THE MORTAL COIL,
2817,THE MORTAL COIL,"There are degrees of naturalness in nature, however. How far from the"
2818,THE MORTAL COIL,hubbub of commercialism should the poet reside? Burns and Wordsworth
2819,THE MORTAL COIL,"were content with the farm country, but for poets whose theories were"
2820,THE MORTAL COIL,not so intimately joined with experience such an environment was too
2821,THE MORTAL COIL,tame. Bowles would send his visionary boy into the wilderness.
2822,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: See _The Visionary Boy_.] Coleridge and Southey went so
2823,THE MORTAL COIL,"far as to lay plans for emigrating, in person, to the banks of the"
2824,THE MORTAL COIL,Susquehanna. Shelley felt that savage conditions best foster poetry.
2825,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: See the _Defense of Poetry_: ""In the infancy of society"
2826,THE MORTAL COIL,"every author is necessarily a poet.""] Campbell, in _Gertrude of"
2827,THE MORTAL COIL,"Wyoming_, made his bard an Indian, and commented on his songs,"
2828,THE MORTAL COIL,
2829,THE MORTAL COIL,"So finished he the rhyme, howe'er uncouth,"
2830,THE MORTAL COIL,That true to Nature's fervid feelings ran
2831,THE MORTAL COIL,(And song is but the eloquence of truth).
2832,THE MORTAL COIL,
2833,THE MORTAL COIL,"The early American poet, J. G. Percival, expressed the same theory,"
2834,THE MORTAL COIL,"declaring of poetry,"
2835,THE MORTAL COIL,
2836,THE MORTAL COIL,Its seat is deeper in the savage breast
2837,THE MORTAL COIL,Than in the man of cities.
2838,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _Poetry_.]
2839,THE MORTAL COIL,
2840,THE MORTAL COIL,"To most of us, this conception of the poet is familiar because of"
2841,THE MORTAL COIL,"acquaintance, from childhood, with Chibiabus, ""he the sweetest of all"
2842,THE MORTAL COIL,"singers,"" in Longfellow's _Hiawatha_."
2843,THE MORTAL COIL,
2844,THE MORTAL COIL,"But the poet of to-day may well pause, before he starts to an Indian"
2845,THE MORTAL COIL,reservation. What is the mysterious benefit which the poet derives from
2846,THE MORTAL COIL,"nature? Humility and common sense, Burns would probably answer, and that"
2847,THE MORTAL COIL,response would not appeal to the majority of poets. A mystical
2848,THE MORTAL COIL,"experience of religion, Wordsworth would say, of course. A wealth of"
2849,THE MORTAL COIL,"imagery, nineteenth century poets would hardly think it worth while to"
2850,THE MORTAL COIL,"add, for the influence of natural scenery upon poetic metaphors has come"
2851,THE MORTAL COIL,to be such a matter of course that one hardly realizes its significance.
2852,THE MORTAL COIL,"Perhaps, too, poets should admit oftener than they do the influence of"
2853,THE MORTAL COIL,nature's rhythms upon their style. As Madison Cawein says
2854,THE MORTAL COIL,
2855,THE MORTAL COIL,If the wind and the brook and the bird would teach
2856,THE MORTAL COIL,"My heart their beautiful parts of speech,"
2857,THE MORTAL COIL,"And the natural art they say these with,"
2858,THE MORTAL COIL,My soul would sing of beauty and myth
2859,THE MORTAL COIL,In a rhyme and a meter none before
2860,THE MORTAL COIL,"Have sung in their love, or dreamed in their lore."
2861,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _Preludes_.]
2862,THE MORTAL COIL,
2863,THE MORTAL COIL,"The influence of nature which the romantic poet stressed most, however,"
2864,THE MORTAL COIL,was a negative one. In a sense in which Wordsworth probably did not
2865,THE MORTAL COIL,"intend it, the romantic poet betrayed himself hastening to nature"
2866,THE MORTAL COIL,
2867,THE MORTAL COIL,More like a man
2868,THE MORTAL COIL,"Flying from something that he dreads, than one"
2869,THE MORTAL COIL,Who sought the thing he loved.
2870,THE MORTAL COIL,
2871,THE MORTAL COIL,"What nature is not, seemed often her chief charm to the romanticist."
2872,THE MORTAL COIL,"Bowles sent his visionary boy to ""romantic solitude."" Byron [Footnote:"
2873,THE MORTAL COIL,"See _Childe Harold_.] and Shelley, [Footnote: See _Epipsychidion_.] too,"
2874,THE MORTAL COIL,were as much concerned with escaping from humanity as with meeting
2875,THE MORTAL COIL,"nature. Only Wordsworth, in the romantic period, felt that the poet's"
2876,THE MORTAL COIL,life ought not to be wholly disjoined from his fellows. [Footnote: See

2880,THE MORTAL COIL,Of course the poet's quarrel with his unappreciative public has led him
2881,THE MORTAL COIL,"to express a longing for complete solitude sporadically, even down to"
2882,THE MORTAL COIL,"the present time, but by the middle of the nineteenth century ""romantic"
2883,THE MORTAL COIL,"solitude"" as the poet's perennial habitat seems just about to have run"
2884,THE MORTAL COIL,"its course. Of the major poets, Matthew Arnold alone consistently urges"
2885,THE MORTAL COIL,"the poet to flee from ""the strange disease of modern life."" The Scholar"
2886,THE MORTAL COIL,"Gypsy lives the ideal life of a poet, Matthew Arnold would say, and"
2887,THE MORTAL COIL,preserves his poetical temperament because of his escape from
2888,THE MORTAL COIL,civilization:
2889,THE MORTAL COIL,
2890,THE MORTAL COIL,"For early didst thou leave the world, with powers"
2891,THE MORTAL COIL,"Fresh, undiverted to the world without,"
2892,THE MORTAL COIL,"Firm to their mark, not spent on other things;"
2893,THE MORTAL COIL,"Free from the sick fatigue, the languid doubt"
2894,THE MORTAL COIL,"Which much to have tried, in much been baffled brings."
2895,THE MORTAL COIL,
2896,THE MORTAL COIL,"No doubt, solitude magnifies the poet's sense of his own personality."
2897,THE MORTAL COIL,"Stephen Phillips says of Emily Brontë's poetic gift,"
2898,THE MORTAL COIL,
2899,THE MORTAL COIL,Only barren hills
2900,THE MORTAL COIL,"Could wring the woman riches out of thee,"
2901,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _Emily Brontë_.]
2902,THE MORTAL COIL,
2903,THE MORTAL COIL,and there are several poets of whom a similar statement might be made.
2904,THE MORTAL COIL,But the Victorians were aware that only half of a poet's nature was
2905,THE MORTAL COIL,developed thus. Tennyson [Footnote: See _The Palace of Art_.] and
2906,THE MORTAL COIL,Mrs. Browning [Footnote: See _The Poet's Vow_; Letters to Robert
2907,THE MORTAL COIL,"Browning, January 1, 1846, and March 20, 1845.] both sounded a warning"
2908,THE MORTAL COIL,"as to the dangers of complete isolation. And at present, though the"
2909,THE MORTAL COIL,"eremite poet is still with us, [Footnote: See Lascelles Ambercrombe,"
2910,THE MORTAL COIL,"_An Escape_; J. E. Flecker, _Dirge_; Madison Cawein, _Comrading_; Yeats,"
2911,THE MORTAL COIL,_The Lake Isle of Innisfree_.] he does not have everything his own way.
2912,THE MORTAL COIL,
2913,THE MORTAL COIL,For it has begun to occur to poets that it may not have been merely
2914,THE MORTAL COIL,anuntoward accident that several of their loftiest brethren were reared
2915,THE MORTAL COIL,in
2916,THE MORTAL COIL,"London. In the romantic period even London-bred Keats said, as a matter"
2917,THE MORTAL COIL,"of course,"
2918,THE MORTAL COIL,
2919,THE MORTAL COIL,"The coy muse, with me she would not live"
2920,THE MORTAL COIL,"In this dark city,"
2921,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: _Epistle to George Felton Mathew_. Wordsworth's sonnet,"
2922,THE MORTAL COIL,"""Earth has not anything to show more fair,"" seems to have been unique at"
2923,THE MORTAL COIL,this time.]
2924,THE MORTAL COIL,
2925,THE MORTAL COIL,"and the American romanticist, Emerson, said of the poet,"
2926,THE MORTAL COIL,
2927,THE MORTAL COIL,In cities he was low and mean;
2928,THE MORTAL COIL,The mountain waters washed him clean.
2929,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _The Poet_.]
2930,THE MORTAL COIL,
2931,THE MORTAL COIL,"But Lowell protested against such a statement, avowing of the muse,"
2932,THE MORTAL COIL,
2933,THE MORTAL COIL,She can find a nobler theme for song
2934,THE MORTAL COIL,In the most loathsome man that blasts the sight
2935,THE MORTAL COIL,Than in the broad expanse of sea and shore.
2936,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _L'Envoi_.]
2937,THE MORTAL COIL,
2938,THE MORTAL COIL,A number of the Victorians acknowledged that they lived from choice in
2939,THE MORTAL COIL,London. Christina Rossetti admitted frankly that she preferred London to
2940,THE MORTAL COIL,"the country, and defended herself with Bacon's statement, ""The souls of"
2941,THE MORTAL COIL,"the living are the beauty of the world."" [Footnote: See E. L. Gary,"
2942,THE MORTAL COIL,"_The Rossettis_, p. 236.] Mrs. Browning made Aurora outgrow pastoral"
2943,THE MORTAL COIL,"verse, and not only reside in London, but find her inspiration there."
2944,THE MORTAL COIL,Francis Thompson and William Henley were not ashamed to admit that they
2945,THE MORTAL COIL,"were inspired by London. James Thomson, B.V., belongs with them in this"
2946,THE MORTAL COIL,"regard, for though he depicted the horror of visions conjured up in the"
2947,THE MORTAL COIL,"city streets in a way unparalleled in English verse, [Footnote: See _The"
2948,THE MORTAL COIL,City of Dreadful Night_.] this is not the same thing as the romantic
2949,THE MORTAL COIL,poet's repudiation of the city as an unimaginative environment.
2950,THE MORTAL COIL,
2951,THE MORTAL COIL,"Coming to more recent verse, we find Austin Dobson still feeling it an"
2952,THE MORTAL COIL,anomaly that his muse should prefer the city to the country. [Footnote:
2953,THE MORTAL COIL,"See _On London Stones_.] John Davidson, also, was very self-conscious"
2954,THE MORTAL COIL,about his city poets. [Footnote: See _Fleet Street Eclogues_.] But as
2955,THE MORTAL COIL,landscape painters are beginning to see and record the beauty in the
2956,THE MORTAL COIL,"most congested city districts, so poets have been making their muse more"
2957,THE MORTAL COIL,"and more at home there, until our contemporary poets scarcely stop to"
2958,THE MORTAL COIL,take their residence in the city otherwise than as a matter of course.
2959,THE MORTAL COIL,Alan Seeger cries out for Paris as the ideal habitat of the singer.
2960,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: See _Paris_.] Even New York and Chicago [Footnote: See Carl
2961,THE MORTAL COIL,"Sandburg, _Chicago Poems_; Edgar Lee Masters, _The Loop_; William"
2962,THE MORTAL COIL,"Griffith, _City Pastorals_; Charles H. Towne, _The City_.] are beginning"
2963,THE MORTAL COIL,to serve as backgrounds for the poet figure. A poem called _A Winter
2964,THE MORTAL COIL,Night_ reveals Sara Teasdale as thoroughly at home in Manhattan as the
2965,THE MORTAL COIL,most bucolic shepherd among his flocks.
2966,THE MORTAL COIL,
2967,THE MORTAL COIL,To poets' minds the only unæsthetic habitat nowadays seems to be the
2968,THE MORTAL COIL,country town. Although Edgar Lee Masters writes what he calls poetry
2969,THE MORTAL COIL,"inspired by it, the reader of the _Spoon River Anthology_ is still"
2970,THE MORTAL COIL,"disposed to sympathize with Benjamin Fraser of Spoon River, the artist"
2971,THE MORTAL COIL,whose genius was crushed by his ghastly environment.
2972,THE MORTAL COIL,
2973,THE MORTAL COIL,"So manifold, in fact, are the attractions of the world to the modern"
2974,THE MORTAL COIL,"poet, that the vagabond singer has come into special favor lately. Of"
2975,THE MORTAL COIL,"course he has appeared in English song ever since the time of minstrels,"
2976,THE MORTAL COIL,"but usually, as in the Old English poem, _The Wanderer_, he has been"
2977,THE MORTAL COIL,unhappy in his roving life. Even so modern a poet as Scott was in the
2978,THE MORTAL COIL,habit of portraying his minstrels as old and homesick. [Footnote: See
2979,THE MORTAL COIL,_The Lay of the Last Minstrel_.] But Byron set the fashion among poets
2980,THE MORTAL COIL,"of desiring ""a world to roam through,"" [Footnote: _Epistle to Augusta_.]"
2981,THE MORTAL COIL,and the poet who is a wanderer from choice has not been unknown since
2982,THE MORTAL COIL,Byron's day. [Footnote: Alfred Dommett and George Borrow are notable.]
2983,THE MORTAL COIL,"The poet vagabond of to-day, as he is portrayed in Maurice Hewlitt's"
2984,THE MORTAL COIL,"autobiographical novels, _Rest Harrow_ and _Open Country_, and William"
2985,THE MORTAL COIL,"H. Davies' tramp poetry, looks upon his condition in life as ideal."
2986,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: See also Francis Carlin, _Denby the Rhymer_ (1918); Henry"
2987,THE MORTAL COIL,"Herbert Knibbs, _Songs of the Trail_ (1920)]  Alan Seeger, too,"
2988,THE MORTAL COIL,"concurred in the view, declaring,"
2989,THE MORTAL COIL,
2990,THE MORTAL COIL,Down the free roads of human happiness
2991,THE MORTAL COIL,"I frolicked, poor of purse but light of heart."
2992,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _Sonnet to Sidney_.]
2993,THE MORTAL COIL,
2994,THE MORTAL COIL,"""Poor of purse!"" The words recall us to another of the poet's quarrels"
2995,THE MORTAL COIL,"with the world in which he is imprisoned. Should the philanthropist, as"
2996,THE MORTAL COIL,"has often been suggested, endow the poet with an independent income?"
2997,THE MORTAL COIL,What a long and glorious tradition would then be broken! From Chaucer's
2998,THE MORTAL COIL,"_Complaint to His Empty Purse_, onward, English poetry has borne"
2999,THE MORTAL COIL,the record of its maker's poverty. The verse of our period is filled
3000,THE MORTAL COIL,with names from the past that offer our poets a noble precedent for
3001,THE MORTAL COIL,"their destitution,--Homer, Cervantes, Camöens, Spenser, Dryden, Butler,"
3002,THE MORTAL COIL,"Johnson, Otway, Collins, Chatterton, Burns,--all these have their want"
3003,THE MORTAL COIL,exposed in nineteeth and twentieth century verse.
3004,THE MORTAL COIL,
3005,THE MORTAL COIL,"The wary philanthropist, before launching into relief schemes, may well"
3006,THE MORTAL COIL,"inquire into the cause of such wretchedness. The obvious answer is, of"
3007,THE MORTAL COIL,"course, that instead of earning a livelihood the poet has spent his time"
3008,THE MORTAL COIL,"on a vocation that makes no pecuniary return. Poets like to tell us,"
3009,THE MORTAL COIL,"also, that their pride, and a fine sense of honour, hold them back from"
3010,THE MORTAL COIL,illegitimate means of acquiring wealth. But tradition has it that there
3011,THE MORTAL COIL,are other contributing causes. Edmund C. Stedman's _Bohemia_ reveals the
3012,THE MORTAL COIL,fact that the artist has most impractical ideas about the disposal of
3013,THE MORTAL COIL,"his income. He reasons that, since the more guests he has, the smaller"
3014,THE MORTAL COIL,"the cost per person, then if he can only entertain extensively enough,"
3015,THE MORTAL COIL,"the cost _per caput_ will be _nil_. Not only so, but the poet is likely"
3016,THE MORTAL COIL,"to lose sight completely of tomorrow's needs, once he has a little ready"
3017,THE MORTAL COIL,"cash on hand. A few years ago, Philistines derived a good deal of"
3018,THE MORTAL COIL,"contemptuous amusement from a poet's statement,"
3019,THE MORTAL COIL,
3020,THE MORTAL COIL,"Had I two loaves of bread--ay, ay!"
3021,THE MORTAL COIL,One would I sell and daffodils buy
3022,THE MORTAL COIL,To feed my soul.
3023,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: _Beauty_, Theodore Harding Rand.]"
3024,THE MORTAL COIL,
3025,THE MORTAL COIL,What is to be done with such people? Charity officers are continually
3026,THE MORTAL COIL,asking.
3027,THE MORTAL COIL,
3028,THE MORTAL COIL,What relief measure can poets themselves suggest? When they are speaking
3029,THE MORTAL COIL,"of older poets, they are apt to offer no constructive criticism, but"
3030,THE MORTAL COIL,only denunciation of society. Their general tone is that of Burns' lines
3031,THE MORTAL COIL,_Written Under the Portrait of Ferguson:_
3032,THE MORTAL COIL,
3033,THE MORTAL COIL,Curse on ungrateful man that can be pleased
3034,THE MORTAL COIL,And yet can starve the author of the pleasure.
3035,THE MORTAL COIL,
3036,THE MORTAL COIL,Occasionally the imaginary poet who appears in their verse is quite as
3037,THE MORTAL COIL,"bitter. Alexander Smith's hero protests against being ""dungeoned in"
3038,THE MORTAL COIL,"poverty."" One of Richard Gilder's poets warns the public,"
3039,THE MORTAL COIL,
3040,THE MORTAL COIL,You need not weep for and sigh for and saint me
3041,THE MORTAL COIL,After you've starved me and driven me dead.
3042,THE MORTAL COIL,"Friends, do you hear? What I want is bread."
3043,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _The Young Poet_.]
3044,THE MORTAL COIL,
3045,THE MORTAL COIL,Through the thin veneer of the fictitious poet in Joaquin Miller's
3046,THE MORTAL COIL,"_Ina_, the author himself appears, raving,"
3047,THE MORTAL COIL,
3048,THE MORTAL COIL,A poet! a poet forsooth! Fool! hungry fool!
3049,THE MORTAL COIL,Would you know what it means to be a poet?
3050,THE MORTAL COIL,"It is to want a friend, to want a home,"
3051,THE MORTAL COIL,"A country, money,--aye, to want a meal."
3052,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: See also John Savage, _He Writes for Bread_.]"
3053,THE MORTAL COIL,
3054,THE MORTAL COIL,"But in autobiographical verse, the tone changes, and the poet refuses to"
3055,THE MORTAL COIL,"pose as a candidate for charity. Rather, he parades an ostentatious"
3056,THE MORTAL COIL,"horror of filthy lucre, only paralleled by his distaste for food. Mrs."
3057,THE MORTAL COIL,"Browning boasts,"
3058,THE MORTAL COIL,
3059,THE MORTAL COIL,The Devil himself scarce trusts his patented
3060,THE MORTAL COIL,"Gold-making art to any who makes rhymes,"
3061,THE MORTAL COIL,But culls his Faustus from philosophers
3062,THE MORTAL COIL,And not from poets.
3063,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _Aurora Leigh_.]
3064,THE MORTAL COIL,
3065,THE MORTAL COIL,A poet who can make ends meet is practically convicted of being no true
3066,THE MORTAL COIL,"artist. Shakespeare is so solitary an exception to this rule, that his"
3067,THE MORTAL COIL,"mercenary aspect is a pure absurdity to his comrades, as Edwin Arlington"
3068,THE MORTAL COIL,Robinson conceives of them. [Footnote: See _Ben Jonson Entertains a
3069,THE MORTAL COIL,Man from Stratford_.] In the eighteenth century indifference to
3070,THE MORTAL COIL,"remuneration was not so marked, and in poetic epistles, forgers of the"
3071,THE MORTAL COIL,"couplet sometimes concerned themselves over the returns, [Footnote: See"
3072,THE MORTAL COIL,"_Advice to Mr. Pope_, John Hughes; _Economy, The Poet and the Dun_,"
3073,THE MORTAL COIL,"Shenstone.] but since the romantic movement began, such thought has been"
3074,THE MORTAL COIL,"held unworthy. [Footnote: See _To a Poet Abandoning His Art_, Barry"
3075,THE MORTAL COIL,"Cornwall; and _Poets and Poets_, T. E. Browne. On the other hand, see"
3076,THE MORTAL COIL,"Sebastian Evans, _Religio Poetae_.] In fact, even in these days, we are"
3077,THE MORTAL COIL,comparatively safe from a poet's strike.
3078,THE MORTAL COIL,
3079,THE MORTAL COIL,"Usually the poet declares that as for himself, he is indifferent to his"
3080,THE MORTAL COIL,"financial condition. Praed speaks fairly for his brethren, when in _A"
3081,THE MORTAL COIL,"Ballad Teaching How Poetry Is Best Paid For_, he represents their"
3082,THE MORTAL COIL,terms as very easy to meet. Even the melancholy Bowles takes on this
3083,THE MORTAL COIL,"subject, for once, a cheerful attitude, telling his visionary boy,"
3084,THE MORTAL COIL,
3085,THE MORTAL COIL,"Nor fear, if grim before thine eyes"
3086,THE MORTAL COIL,"Pale worldly want, a spectre lowers;"
3087,THE MORTAL COIL,What is a world of vanities
3088,THE MORTAL COIL,To a world as fair as ours?
3089,THE MORTAL COIL,
3090,THE MORTAL COIL,"In the same spirit Burns belittles his poverty, saying, in _An Epistle"
3091,THE MORTAL COIL,"to Davie, Fellow Poet_:"
3092,THE MORTAL COIL,
3093,THE MORTAL COIL,To lie in kilns and barns at e'en
3094,THE MORTAL COIL,"When bones are crazed, and blind is thin"
3095,THE MORTAL COIL,"Is doubtless great distress,"
3096,THE MORTAL COIL,Yet then content would make us blest.
3097,THE MORTAL COIL,
3098,THE MORTAL COIL,"Shelley, too, eschews wealth, declaring, in _Epipsychidion_,"
3099,THE MORTAL COIL,
3100,THE MORTAL COIL,"Our simple life wants little, and true taste"
3101,THE MORTAL COIL,Hires not the pale drudge luxury to waste
3102,THE MORTAL COIL,The scene it would adorn.
3103,THE MORTAL COIL,
3104,THE MORTAL COIL,Later poetry is likely to take an even exuberant attitude toward
3105,THE MORTAL COIL,"poverty. [Footnote: See especially verse on the Mermaid group, as"
3106,THE MORTAL COIL,"_Tales of the Mermaid Inn_, Alfred Noyes. See also Josephine Preston"
3107,THE MORTAL COIL,"Peabody, _The Golden Shoes_; Richard Le Gallienne, _Faery Gold_; J. G."

3110,THE MORTAL COIL,"of Autobiography_; Thomas Gordon Hake, _The Poet's Feast_; Dana Burnet,"
3111,THE MORTAL COIL,"_In a Garret_; Henry Aylett Sampson, _Stephen Phillips Bankrupt_.] The"
3112,THE MORTAL COIL,poet's wealth of song is so great that he leaves coin to those who wish
3113,THE MORTAL COIL,"it. Indeed he often has a superstitious fear of wealth, lest it take"
3114,THE MORTAL COIL,"away his delight in song. In Markham's _The Shoes of Happiness_, only"
3115,THE MORTAL COIL,the poet who is too poor to buy shoes possesses the secret of joy.
3116,THE MORTAL COIL,"With a touching trust in providence, another poet cries,"
3117,THE MORTAL COIL,
3118,THE MORTAL COIL,"Starving, still I smile,"
3119,THE MORTAL COIL,"Laugh at want and wrong,"
3120,THE MORTAL COIL,He is fed and clothed
3121,THE MORTAL COIL,To whom God giveth song.
3122,THE MORTAL COIL,"[Footnote: Anne Reeve Aldrich, _A Crowned Poet_.]"
3123,THE MORTAL COIL,
3124,THE MORTAL COIL,It is doubtful indeed that the poet would have his fate averted. Pope's
3125,THE MORTAL COIL,"satirical coupling of want and song, as cause and effect,"
3126,THE MORTAL COIL,
3127,THE MORTAL COIL,"One cell there is, concealed from vulgar eye,"
3128,THE MORTAL COIL,The cave of Poverty and Poetry.
3129,THE MORTAL COIL,"Keen, hollow winds howl through the bleak recess,"
3130,THE MORTAL COIL,"Emblem of music caused by emptiness,"
3131,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _Dunciad_.]
3132,THE MORTAL COIL,
3133,THE MORTAL COIL,is accepted quite literally by later writers. Emerson's theory of
3134,THE MORTAL COIL,"compensations applies delightfully here as everywhere, and he meditates"
3135,THE MORTAL COIL,"on the poet,"
3136,THE MORTAL COIL,
3137,THE MORTAL COIL,The Muse gave special charge
3138,THE MORTAL COIL,"His learning should be deep and large,--"
3139,THE MORTAL COIL,*       *       *       *       *
3140,THE MORTAL COIL,"His flesh should feel, his eyes should read"
3141,THE MORTAL COIL,Every maxim of dreadful need.

3145,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _The Poet_.]
3146,THE MORTAL COIL,
3147,THE MORTAL COIL,It may appear doubtful to us whether the poet has painted ideal
3148,THE MORTAL COIL,conditions for the nurture of genius in his picture of the poet's
3149,THE MORTAL COIL,"physical frame, his environment, and his material endowment, inasmuch as"
3150,THE MORTAL COIL,"the death rate among young bards,--imaginary ones, at least, is"
3151,THE MORTAL COIL,appalling. What can account for it?
3152,THE MORTAL COIL,
3153,THE MORTAL COIL,"In a large percentage of cases, the poet's natural frailty of"
3154,THE MORTAL COIL,"constitution is to blame for his early death, of course, but another"
3155,THE MORTAL COIL,popular explanation is that the very keenness of the poet's flame causes
3156,THE MORTAL COIL,"it to burn out the quicker. Byron finds an early death fitting to him,"
3157,THE MORTAL COIL,
3158,THE MORTAL COIL,"For I had the share of life that might have filled a century,"
3159,THE MORTAL COIL,Before its fourth in time had passed me by.

3161,THE MORTAL COIL,

3170,THE MORTAL COIL,
3171,THE MORTAL COIL,this richness of experience is not inevitably bound up with
3172,THE MORTAL COIL,"recklessness, poets feel. The quality is in such a poet even as Emily"
3173,THE MORTAL COIL,"Brontë, of whom it is written:"
3174,THE MORTAL COIL,
3175,THE MORTAL COIL,They live not long of thy pure fire composed;
3176,THE MORTAL COIL,Earth asks but mud of those that will endure.
3177,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: Stephen Phillips.  _Emily Brontë_.]
3178,THE MORTAL COIL,
3179,THE MORTAL COIL,Another cause of the poet's early death is certainly his fearlessness.
3180,THE MORTAL COIL,Shelley prophesies that his daring spirit will meet death
3181,THE MORTAL COIL,
3182,THE MORTAL COIL,Far from the trembling throng
3183,THE MORTAL COIL,Whose souls are never to the tempest given.
3184,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _Adonais_.]
3185,THE MORTAL COIL,
3186,THE MORTAL COIL,"With the deaths of Rupert Brooke, Alan Seeger, Joyce Kilmer, and Francis"
3187,THE MORTAL COIL,"Ledwidge, this element in the poet's disposition has been brought home"
3188,THE MORTAL COIL,"to the public. Joyce Kilmer wrote back from the trenches, ""It is wrong"
3189,THE MORTAL COIL,for a poet ... to be listening to elevated trains when there are
3190,THE MORTAL COIL,screaming shells to hear ... and the bright face of danger to dream
3191,THE MORTAL COIL,"about."" [Footnote: Letter to his wife, March 12, 1918.] And in his"
3192,THE MORTAL COIL,"article on Joyce Kilmer in _The Bookman_, Richard LeGallienne"
3193,THE MORTAL COIL,"speaks of young poets ""touched with the ringer of a moonlight that has"
3194,THE MORTAL COIL,"written 'fated' upon their brows,"" adding, ""Probably our feeling is"
3195,THE MORTAL COIL,nothing more than our realization that temperaments so vital and intense
3196,THE MORTAL COIL,must inevitably tempt richer and swifter fates than those less
3197,THE MORTAL COIL,"wild-winged."""
3198,THE MORTAL COIL,
3199,THE MORTAL COIL,It is a question whether poets would expect us to condole with them or
3200,THE MORTAL COIL,to felicitate them upon the short duration of their subjection to
3201,THE MORTAL COIL,mortality. Even when the poet speaks of his early death solely with
3202,THE MORTAL COIL,"regard to its effect upon his earthly reputation, his attitude is not"
3203,THE MORTAL COIL,wholly clear. Much elegiac verse expresses such stereotyped sorrow for a
3204,THE MORTAL COIL,"departed bard that it is not significant. In other cases, one seems to"
3205,THE MORTAL COIL,overhear the gasp of relief from a patron whom time can never force to
3206,THE MORTAL COIL,retract his superlative claims for his protégé's promise.
3207,THE MORTAL COIL,
3208,THE MORTAL COIL,More significant is a different note which is sometimes heard. In
3209,THE MORTAL COIL,"Alexander Smith's _Life Drama_, it is ostensibly ironic. The critic"
3210,THE MORTAL COIL,"muses,"
3211,THE MORTAL COIL,
3212,THE MORTAL COIL,He died--'twas shrewd:
3213,THE MORTAL COIL,And came with all his youth and unblown hopes
3214,THE MORTAL COIL,"On the world's heart, and touched it into tears."
3215,THE MORTAL COIL,
3216,THE MORTAL COIL,"In _Sordello_, likewise, it is the unappreciative critic who expresses"
3217,THE MORTAL COIL,this sort of pleasure in Eglamor's death. But this feeling has also been
3218,THE MORTAL COIL,"expressed with all seriousness, as in Stephen Phillip's _Keats_:"
3219,THE MORTAL COIL,
3220,THE MORTAL COIL,I have seen more glory in sunrise
3221,THE MORTAL COIL,"Than in the deepening of azure noon,"
3222,THE MORTAL COIL,
3223,THE MORTAL COIL,or in Francis Thompson's _The Cloud's Swan Song_:
3224,THE MORTAL COIL,
3225,THE MORTAL COIL,"I thought of Keats, that died in perfect time,"
3226,THE MORTAL COIL,"In predecease of his just-sickening song,"
3227,THE MORTAL COIL,"Of him that set, wrapped in his radiant rhyme,"
3228,THE MORTAL COIL,Sunlike in sea. Life longer had been life too long.
3229,THE MORTAL COIL,
3230,THE MORTAL COIL,"Obviously we are in the wake of the Rousseau theory, acclimatized in"
3231,THE MORTAL COIL,"English poetry by Wordsworth's youth ""who daily farther from the east"
3232,THE MORTAL COIL,"must travel."" A long array of poets testifies to the doctrine that a"
3233,THE MORTAL COIL,"poet's first days are his best. [Footnote: See S. T. Coleridge, _Youth"

3246,THE MORTAL COIL,through English poetry. Hear it in Arnold's _Progress of Poetry_:
3247,THE MORTAL COIL,
3248,THE MORTAL COIL,"Youth rambles on life's arid mount,"
3249,THE MORTAL COIL,"And strikes the rock and finds the vein,"
3250,THE MORTAL COIL,And brings the water from the fount.
3251,THE MORTAL COIL,The fount which shall not flow again.
3252,THE MORTAL COIL,
3253,THE MORTAL COIL,The man mature with labor chops
3254,THE MORTAL COIL,"For the bright stream a channel grand,"
3255,THE MORTAL COIL,And sees not that the sacred drops
3256,THE MORTAL COIL,Ran off and vanished out of hand.
3257,THE MORTAL COIL,
3258,THE MORTAL COIL,And then the old man totters nigh
3259,THE MORTAL COIL,And feebly rakes among the stones;
3260,THE MORTAL COIL,"The mount is mute, the channel dry,"
3261,THE MORTAL COIL,And down he lays his weary bones.
3262,THE MORTAL COIL,
3263,THE MORTAL COIL,"But the strangle hold of complimentary verse upon English poetry, if"
3264,THE MORTAL COIL,"nothing else, would prevent this view being unanimously expressed there."
3265,THE MORTAL COIL,"For in the Victorian period, poets who began their literary careers by"
3266,THE MORTAL COIL,prophesying their early decease lived on and on. They themselves might
3267,THE MORTAL COIL,"bewail the loss of their gift in old age--in fact, it was usual for them"
3268,THE MORTAL COIL,"to do so [Footnote: See Scott, _Farewell to the Muse_; Landor, _Dull is"
3269,THE MORTAL COIL,"my Verse_; J. G. Percival, _Invocation_; Matthew Arnold, _Growing Old_;"
3270,THE MORTAL COIL,"Longfellow, _My Books_; O. W. Holmes, _The Silent Melody_; C. W."

3272,THE MORTAL COIL,"MacNiel, _A Prayer_; Harvey Hubbard, _The Old Minstrel_.]--but it would"
3273,THE MORTAL COIL,never do for their disciples to concur in the sentiment. Consequently we
3274,THE MORTAL COIL,"have a flood of complimentary verses, assuring the great poets of their"
3275,THE MORTAL COIL,"unaltered charm.[Footnote: See Swinburne, _Age and Song, The Centenary"
3276,THE MORTAL COIL,"of Landor, Statue of Victor Hugo_; O. W. Holmes, _Whittier's Eightieth"
3277,THE MORTAL COIL,"Birthday, Bryant's Seventieth Birthday_; E. E. Stedman, _Ad Vatem_; P."

3282,THE MORTAL COIL,"_J. G. Whittier_; Mary Clemmer, _To Whittier_; Percy Mackaye, _Browning"
3283,THE MORTAL COIL,to Ben Ezra_.] And of course it is all worth very little as indicating
3284,THE MORTAL COIL,the writer's attitude toward old age. Yet the fact that Landor was still
3285,THE MORTAL COIL,"singing as he ""tottered on into his ninth decade,""--that Browning,"
3286,THE MORTAL COIL,"Tennyson, Swinburne, Longfellow, Whittier, Holme's, and Whitman"
3287,THE MORTAL COIL,"continued to feel the stir of creation when their hair was hoary, may"
3288,THE MORTAL COIL,have had a genuine influence on younger writers.
3289,THE MORTAL COIL,
3290,THE MORTAL COIL,Greater significance attaches to the fact that some of the
3291,THE MORTAL COIL,self-revealing verse lamenting the decay of inspiration in old age is
3292,THE MORTAL COIL,"equivocal, as Landor's"
3293,THE MORTAL COIL,
3294,THE MORTAL COIL,Dull is my verse: not even thou
3295,THE MORTAL COIL,Who movest many cares away
3296,THE MORTAL COIL,From this lone breast and weary brow
3297,THE MORTAL COIL,"Canst make, as once, its fountains play;"
3298,THE MORTAL COIL,"No, nor those gentle words that now"
3299,THE MORTAL COIL,"Support my heart to hear thee say,"
3300,THE MORTAL COIL,The bird upon the lonely bough
3301,THE MORTAL COIL,Sings sweetest at the close of day.
3302,THE MORTAL COIL,
3303,THE MORTAL COIL,"It is, of course, even more meaningful when the aged poet, disregarding"
3304,THE MORTAL COIL,"convention, frankly asserts the desirability of long life for his race."
3305,THE MORTAL COIL,"Browning, despite the sadness of the poet's age recorded in _Cleon_"
3306,THE MORTAL COIL,"and the _Prologue to Aslando_, should doubtless be remembered for"
3307,THE MORTAL COIL,his belief in
3308,THE MORTAL COIL,
3309,THE MORTAL COIL,"The last of life for which the first was made,"
3310,THE MORTAL COIL,
3311,THE MORTAL COIL,as applied to poets as well as to other men. In America old age found
3312,THE MORTAL COIL,"its most enthusiastic advocate in Walt Whitman, who in lines _To Get"
3313,THE MORTAL COIL,the Final Lilt of Songs_ indicated undiminished confidence in himself
3314,THE MORTAL COIL,"at eighty. Bayard Taylor, [Footnote: See _My Prologue_.] too, and"
3315,THE MORTAL COIL,"Edward Dowden, [Footnote: See _The Mage_.] were not dismayed by"
3316,THE MORTAL COIL,their longevity.
3317,THE MORTAL COIL,
3318,THE MORTAL COIL,"But we are most concerned, naturally, with wholly impersonal verse, and"
3319,THE MORTAL COIL,in it the aged poet is never wholly absent from English thought. As the
3320,THE MORTAL COIL,"youthful singer suggests the southland, so the aged bard seems"
3321,THE MORTAL COIL,indigenous to the north. It seems inevitable that Gray should depict the
3322,THE MORTAL COIL,"Scotch bard as old, [Footnote: _The Bard_.] and that Scott's"
3323,THE MORTAL COIL,"minstrels should be old. Campbell, too, follows the Scotch tradition."
3324,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: See _Lochiel's Warning_.] It is the prophetic power of
3325,THE MORTAL COIL,"these fictional poets, no doubt, that makes age seem essential to them."
3326,THE MORTAL COIL,"The poet in Campbell's poem explains,"
3327,THE MORTAL COIL,
3328,THE MORTAL COIL,'Tis the sunset of life gives me mystical lore.
3329,THE MORTAL COIL,
3330,THE MORTAL COIL,"Outside of Scotch poetry one finds, occasionally, a similar faith in the"
3331,THE MORTAL COIL,old poet. Mrs. Browning's observation tells her that maturity alone can
3332,THE MORTAL COIL,"express itself with youthful freshness. Aurora declares,"
3333,THE MORTAL COIL,
3334,THE MORTAL COIL,I count it strange and hard to understand
3335,THE MORTAL COIL,That nearly all young poets should write old.
3336,THE MORTAL COIL,... It may be perhaps
3337,THE MORTAL COIL,Such have not settled long and deep enough
3338,THE MORTAL COIL,"In trance to attain to clairvoyance, and still"
3339,THE MORTAL COIL,"The memory mixes with the vision, spoils"
3340,THE MORTAL COIL,And works it turbid. Or perhaps again
3341,THE MORTAL COIL,In order to discover the Muse Sphinx
3342,THE MORTAL COIL,The melancholy desert must sweep around
3343,THE MORTAL COIL,Behind you as before.
3344,THE MORTAL COIL,
3345,THE MORTAL COIL,"Aurora feels, indeed, that the poet's gift is not proved till age. She"
3346,THE MORTAL COIL,"sighs, remembering her own youth,"
3347,THE MORTAL COIL,
3348,THE MORTAL COIL,"Alas, near all the birds"
3349,THE MORTAL COIL,"Will sing at dawn,--and yet we do not take"
3350,THE MORTAL COIL,The chaffering swallow for the holy lark.
3351,THE MORTAL COIL,
3352,THE MORTAL COIL,Coinciding with this feeling is Rossetti's sentiment:
3353,THE MORTAL COIL,"... Many men are poets in their youth,"
3354,THE MORTAL COIL,But for one sweet-strung soul the wires prolong
3355,THE MORTAL COIL,Even through all age the indomitable song.
3356,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: _Genius in Beauty_.]
3357,THE MORTAL COIL,
3358,THE MORTAL COIL,"Alice Meynell, [Footnote: See _To any Poet_.] too, and Richard Watson"
3359,THE MORTAL COIL,Gilder [Footnote: See _Life is a Bell_.] feel that increasing power of
3360,THE MORTAL COIL,song comes with age.
3361,THE MORTAL COIL,
3362,THE MORTAL COIL,It is doubtless natural that the passionate romantic poets insisted upon
3363,THE MORTAL COIL,"the poet's youth, while the thoughtful Victorians often thought of himas"
3364,THE MORTAL COIL,"old. For one is born with nerves, and it does not take long for them"
3365,THE MORTAL COIL,to wear out; on the other hand a great deal of experience is required
3366,THE MORTAL COIL,before one can even begin to think significantly. Accordingly one is not
3367,THE MORTAL COIL,"surprised, in the turbulent times of Elizabeth, to find Shakespeare, at"
3368,THE MORTAL COIL,"thirty, asserting,"
3369,THE MORTAL COIL,
3370,THE MORTAL COIL,In me thou seest the glowing of such fire
3371,THE MORTAL COIL,"As on the ashes of his youth doth lie,"
3372,THE MORTAL COIL,
3373,THE MORTAL COIL,and conversely it seems fitting that a _De Senectute_ should come
3374,THE MORTAL COIL,from an Augustan period. As for the attitude toward age of our own
3375,THE MORTAL COIL,"day,--the detestation of age expressed by Alan Seeger [Footnote: See"
3376,THE MORTAL COIL,"_There Was a Youth Around Whose Early Way_.] and Rupert Brooke,"
3377,THE MORTAL COIL,[Footnote: See _The Funeral of Youth: Threnody_.]--the complaint of
3378,THE MORTAL COIL,"Francis Ledwidge, at twenty-six, that years are robbing him of his"
3379,THE MORTAL COIL,"inspiration, [Footnote: See _Growing Old, Youth_.]--that, to their"
3380,THE MORTAL COIL,"future readers, will only mean that they lived in days of much feeling"
3381,THE MORTAL COIL,"and action, and that they died young. [Footnote: One of the war poets,"
3382,THE MORTAL COIL,"Joyce Kilmer, was already changing his attitude at thirty. Compare his"
3383,THE MORTAL COIL,"juvenile verse, ""It is not good for poets to grow old,"" with the later"
3384,THE MORTAL COIL,"poem, _Old Poets_.] As the world subsides, after its cataclysm,"
3385,THE MORTAL COIL,"into contemplative revery, it is inevitable that poets will, for a time,"
3386,THE MORTAL COIL,"once more conceive as their ideal, not a singer aflame with youth and"
3387,THE MORTAL COIL,"passion, but a poet of rich experience and profound reflection,"
3388,THE MORTAL COIL,
3389,THE MORTAL COIL,White-bearded and with eyes that look afar
3390,THE MORTAL COIL,"From their still region of perpetual snow,"
3391,THE MORTAL COIL,Beyond the little smokes and stirs of men.

3401,THE POET AS LOVER,
3402,THE POET AS LOVER,Do the _Phaedrus_ and the _Symposium_ leave anything to be said on the
3403,THE POET AS LOVER,"relationship of love and poetry? In the last analysis, probably not. The"
3404,THE POET AS LOVER,"poet, however, is not one to keep silence because of a dearth of new"
3405,THE POET AS LOVER,"philosophical conceptions. As he discovers, with ever fresh wonder, the"
3406,THE POET AS LOVER,"power of love as muse, each new poet, in turn, is wont to pour his"
3407,THE POET AS LOVER,"gratitude for his inspiration into song, undeterred by the fact that"
3408,THE POET AS LOVER,love has received many encomiums before.
3409,THE POET AS LOVER,
3410,THE POET AS LOVER,It is not strange that this hymn should be broken by rude taunts on the
3411,THE POET AS LOVER,part of the uninitiated.
3412,THE POET AS LOVER,
3413,THE POET AS LOVER,"Saynt Idiote, Lord of these foles alle,"
3414,THE POET AS LOVER,
3415,THE POET AS LOVER,"Chaucer's Troilus called Love, long ago, and the general public has been"
3416,THE POET AS LOVER,no less free with this characterization in the last century than in the
3417,THE POET AS LOVER,fourteenth. Nor is it merely that part of the public which associates
3418,THE POET AS LOVER,"all verse with sentimentality, and flees from it as from a contagion,"
3419,THE POET AS LOVER,which thus sneers at the praise lovers give to their divinity. On the
3420,THE POET AS LOVER,"contrary, certain young aspirants to the poet's laurel, feeling that the"
3421,THE POET AS LOVER,"singer's indebtedness to love is an overworked theme, have tried, like"
3422,THE POET AS LOVER,"the non-lover of the _Phaedrus_, to charm the literary public by"
3423,THE POET AS LOVER,the novelty of a different profession. As the non-lover of classic
3424,THE POET AS LOVER,Greece was so fluent in his periods that Socrates and Phaedrus narrowly
3425,THE POET AS LOVER,"escaped from being overwhelmed by his much speaking, so the non-lover of"
3426,THE POET AS LOVER,the present time says much for himself.
3427,THE POET AS LOVER,
3428,THE POET AS LOVER,"In the first place, our non-lover may assure us, the nature of love is"
3429,THE POET AS LOVER,such that it involves contempt for the life of a bard. For love is a mad
3430,THE POET AS LOVER,"pursuit of life at first hand, in its most engrossing aspect, and it"
3431,THE POET AS LOVER,renders one deaf and blind to all but the object of the chase; while
3432,THE POET AS LOVER,"poetry is, as Plato points out, [Footnote: See the _Republic_ X, §"
3433,THE POET AS LOVER,"599-601; and _Phaedrus_, § 248.] only a pale and lifeless imitation"
3434,THE POET AS LOVER,of the ardors and delights which the lover enjoys at first hand.
3435,THE POET AS LOVER,"Moreover, one who attempts to divide his attention between the muse and"
3436,THE POET AS LOVER,"an earthly mistress, is likely not only to lose the favor of the former,"
3437,THE POET AS LOVER,"but, as the ubiquity of the rejected poet in verse indicates, to lose"
3438,THE POET AS LOVER,"the latter as well, because his temperament will incline him to go into"
3439,THE POET AS LOVER,"retirement and meditate upon his lady's charms, when he should be"
3440,THE POET AS LOVER,"flaunting his own in her presence. It will not be long, indeed, before"
3441,THE POET AS LOVER,he has so covered the object of his affection with the leafage of his
3442,THE POET AS LOVER,"fancy, that she ceases to have an actual existence for him at all. The"
3443,THE POET AS LOVER,non-lover may remind us that even so ardent an advocate of love as Mrs.
3444,THE POET AS LOVER,"Browning voices this danger, confessing, in _Sonnets of the Portuguese_,"
3445,THE POET AS LOVER,[Footnote: Sonnet XXIX.]
3446,THE POET AS LOVER,
3447,THE POET AS LOVER,My thoughts do twine and bud
3448,THE POET AS LOVER,"About thee, as wild vines about a tree"
3449,THE POET AS LOVER,"Put out broad leaves, and soon there's nought to see"
3450,THE POET AS LOVER,Except the straggling green that hides the wood.
3451,THE POET AS LOVER,
3452,THE POET AS LOVER,The non-lover may also recall to our minds the notorious egotism and
3453,THE POET AS LOVER,"self-sufficiency of the poet, which seem incompatible with the humility"
3454,THE POET AS LOVER,and insatiable yearning of the lover. He exults in the declaration of
3455,THE POET AS LOVER,"Keats,"
3456,THE POET AS LOVER,
3457,THE POET AS LOVER,"My solitude is sublime,--for, instead of what I have"
3458,THE POET AS LOVER,"described (_i.e._, domestic bliss) there is sublimity"
3459,THE POET AS LOVER,to welcome me home; the roaring of the wind is my wife; and
3460,THE POET AS LOVER,the stars through the windowpanes are my children; the
3461,THE POET AS LOVER,"mighty abstract idea of beauty in all things, I have,"
3462,THE POET AS LOVER,stifles the more divided and minute domestic happiness.
3463,THE POET AS LOVER,"[Footnote: Letter to George Keats, October 31, 1818.]"
3464,THE POET AS LOVER,
3465,THE POET AS LOVER,"Borne aloft by his admiration for this passage, the non-lover may"
3466,THE POET AS LOVER,himself essay to be sublime. He may picture to us the frozen heights on
3467,THE POET AS LOVER,"which genius resides, where the air is too rare for earthly affection."
3468,THE POET AS LOVER,"He may declare that Keats' Grecian Urn is a symbol of all art, which"
3469,THE POET AS LOVER,must be
3470,THE POET AS LOVER,
3471,THE POET AS LOVER,All breathing human passion far above.
3472,THE POET AS LOVER,
3473,THE POET AS LOVER,"He will assert that the mission of the poet is ""to see life steadily and"
3474,THE POET AS LOVER,"see it whole,"" a feat which is impossible if the worship of one figure"
3475,THE POET AS LOVER,"out of the multitude is allowed to distort relative values, and to throw"
3476,THE POET AS LOVER,his view out of perspective.
3477,THE POET AS LOVER,
3478,THE POET AS LOVER,"Finally, the enemy of love may call as witnesses poets whom he fancies"
3479,THE POET AS LOVER,"he has led astray. Strangely enough, considering the dedication of the"
3480,THE POET AS LOVER,"_Ring and the Book_, he is likely to give most conspicuous place among"
3481,THE POET AS LOVER,"these witnesses to Browning. Like passages of Holy Writ, lines from"
3482,THE POET AS LOVER,Browning have been used as the text for whatever harangue a new
3483,THE POET AS LOVER,"theorist sees fit to give us. In _Youth and Art_, the non-lover"
3484,THE POET AS LOVER,will point out the characteristic attitude of young people who are
3485,THE POET AS LOVER,"""married to their art,"" and consequently have no capacity for other"
3486,THE POET AS LOVER,"affection. In _Pauline_, he will gloat over the hero's confession"
3487,THE POET AS LOVER,that he is inept in love because he is concerned with his perceptions
3488,THE POET AS LOVER,"rather than with their objects, and his explanation,"
3489,THE POET AS LOVER,
3490,THE POET AS LOVER,I am made up of an intensest life;
3491,THE POET AS LOVER,Of a most clear idea of consciousness
3492,THE POET AS LOVER,Of self ...
3493,THE POET AS LOVER,"And I can love nothing,--and this dull truth"
3494,THE POET AS LOVER,Has come at last: but sense supplies a love
3495,THE POET AS LOVER,Encircling me and mingling with my life.
3496,THE POET AS LOVER,
3497,THE POET AS LOVER,"He will point out that Sordello is another example of the same type, for"
3498,THE POET AS LOVER,"though Sordello is ostensibly the lover of Palma, he really finds"
3499,THE POET AS LOVER,nothing outside himself worthy of his unbounded adoration. [Footnote:
3500,THE POET AS LOVER,Compare Browning's treatment of Sordello with the conventional treatment
3501,THE POET AS LOVER,"of him as lover, in _Sordello_, by Mrs. W. Buck (1837).] Turning to"
3502,THE POET AS LOVER,"Tennyson, in _Lucretius_ the non-lover will note the tragic death"
3503,THE POET AS LOVER,of the hero that grows out of the asceticism in love engendered by his
3504,THE POET AS LOVER,absorption in composition. With the greatest pride the enemy of love
3505,THE POET AS LOVER,"will point to his popularity in the 1890's, when the artificial and"
3506,THE POET AS LOVER,heartless artist enjoyed his greatest vogue. As his most scintillating
3507,THE POET AS LOVER,advocate he will choose Oscar Wilde. Assuring us of many prose passages
3508,THE POET AS LOVER,"in his favor, he will read to us the expression of conflict between love"
3509,THE POET AS LOVER,"and art in _Flower of Love_, where Wilde exclaims,"
3510,THE POET AS LOVER,
3511,THE POET AS LOVER,"I have made my choice, have lived my poems, and though my youth is"
3512,THE POET AS LOVER,"gone in wasted days,"
3513,THE POET AS LOVER,I have found the lover's crown of myrtle better than the poet's
3514,THE POET AS LOVER,"crown of bays,"
3515,THE POET AS LOVER,
3516,THE POET AS LOVER,"and he will read the record of the same sense of conflict, in different"
3517,THE POET AS LOVER,"mood, expressed in the sonnet _Hélas_:"
3518,THE POET AS LOVER,
3519,THE POET AS LOVER,To drift with every passion till my soul
3520,THE POET AS LOVER,"Is a stringed lute on which all winds can play,"
3521,THE POET AS LOVER,Is it for this that I have given away
3522,THE POET AS LOVER,Mine ancient wisdom and austere control?
3523,THE POET AS LOVER,Methinks my life is a twice-written scroll
3524,THE POET AS LOVER,Scrawled over on some boyish holiday
3525,THE POET AS LOVER,"With idle songs for pipe and virelai,"
3526,THE POET AS LOVER,Which do but mar the secret of the whole.
3527,THE POET AS LOVER,Surely there was a time I might have trod
3528,THE POET AS LOVER,"The sunlit heights, and from life's dissonance"
3529,THE POET AS LOVER,Struck one clear chord to reach the ears of God.
3530,THE POET AS LOVER,"Is that time dead? Lo, with a little rod"
3531,THE POET AS LOVER,"I did but touch the honey of romance,"
3532,THE POET AS LOVER,And must I lose a soul's inheritance?
3533,THE POET AS LOVER,
3534,THE POET AS LOVER,"And yet, when the non-lover has finally arrived at the peroration of his"
3535,THE POET AS LOVER,"defense, we may remain unshaken in our conviction that from the _Song"
3536,THE POET AS LOVER,"of Solomon_ to the _Love Songs of Sara Teasdale_, the history of poetry"
3537,THE POET AS LOVER,"constitutes an almost unbroken hymn to the power of love, ""the poet, and"
3538,THE POET AS LOVER,"the source of poetry in others,"" [Footnote: _The Symposium_ of Plato, §"
3539,THE POET AS LOVER,196.] as Agathon characterized him at the banquet in Love's honour.
3540,THE POET AS LOVER,"Within the field of our especial inquiry, the last century, we may rest"
3541,THE POET AS LOVER,"assured that there is no true poet whose work, rightly interpreted, is"
3542,THE POET AS LOVER,out of tune with this general acclaim. Even Browning and Oscar Wilde are
3543,THE POET AS LOVER,"to be saved, although, it may be, only as by fire."
3544,THE POET AS LOVER,
3545,THE POET AS LOVER,"The influence of love upon poetry, which we are assuming with such _a"
3546,THE POET AS LOVER,"priori_ certainty, is effected in various ways. The most obvious, of"
3547,THE POET AS LOVER,"course, is by affording new subject matter. The confidence of"
3548,THE POET AS LOVER,"Shakespeare,"
3549,THE POET AS LOVER,
3550,THE POET AS LOVER,How can my muse want subject to invent
3551,THE POET AS LOVER,"While thou dost breathe, that pourest into my verse"
3552,THE POET AS LOVER,Thine own sweet argument?
3553,THE POET AS LOVER,
3554,THE POET AS LOVER,is at least as characteristic of the nineteenth as of the sixteenth
3555,THE POET AS LOVER,"century. The depletion of our lyric poetry, if everything relating to"
3556,THE POET AS LOVER,"the singer's love affairs were omitted, is appalling even to"
3557,THE POET AS LOVER,"contemplate. Yet, if this were the extent of love's influence upon"
3558,THE POET AS LOVER,"poetry, one would have to class it, in kind if not in degree, with any"
3559,THE POET AS LOVER,number of other personal experiences that have thrilled the poet to
3560,THE POET AS LOVER,composition.
3561,THE POET AS LOVER,
3562,THE POET AS LOVER,The scope of love's influence is widened when one reflects upon its
3563,THE POET AS LOVER,"efficacy as a prize held up before the poet, spurring him on to express"
3564,THE POET AS LOVER,himself. In this aspect poetry is often a form of spiritual display
3565,THE POET AS LOVER,comparable to the gay plumage upon the birds at mating season. In the
3566,THE POET AS LOVER,"case of women poets, verse often affords an essentially refined and"
3567,THE POET AS LOVER,lady-like manner of expressing one's sentiments toward a possible
3568,THE POET AS LOVER,"suitor. The convention so charmingly expressed in William Morris' lines,"
3569,THE POET AS LOVER,"_Rhyme Slayeth Shame_, seems to be especially grateful to them. At"
3570,THE POET AS LOVER,"times the ruse fails, as a writer has recently admitted:"
3571,THE POET AS LOVER,
3572,THE POET AS LOVER,"All sing it now, all praise its artless art,"
3573,THE POET AS LOVER,"But ne'er the one for whom the song was made,"
3574,THE POET AS LOVER,"[Footnote: Edith Thomas, _Vos non Nobis_.]"
3575,THE POET AS LOVER,
3576,THE POET AS LOVER,but perhaps the worth of the poetry is not affected by the stubbornness
3577,THE POET AS LOVER,of its recipient. Sara Teasdale very delicately names her anthology of
3578,THE POET AS LOVER,"love poems by women, _The Answering Voice_, but half the poems reveal"
3579,THE POET AS LOVER,"the singer speaking first, while a number of them show her expressing an"
3580,THE POET AS LOVER,open-minded attitude toward any possible applicant for her hand among
3581,THE POET AS LOVER,her readers. But it is not merely for its efficacy as a matrimonial
3582,THE POET AS LOVER,agency that poets are indebted to love.
3583,THE POET AS LOVER,
3584,THE POET AS LOVER,"Since the nineteenth century is primarily the age of the love story,"
3585,THE POET AS LOVER,personal experience of love has been invaluable to the poet in a third
3586,THE POET AS LOVER,way. The taste of the time has demanded that the poet sing of the tender
3587,THE POET AS LOVER,"theme almost exclusively, whether in dramatic, lyric or narrative,"
3588,THE POET AS LOVER,"whether in historical or fictional verse. This is, of course, one reason"
3589,THE POET AS LOVER,"that, wherever the figure of a bard appears in verse, he is almost"
3590,THE POET AS LOVER,"always portrayed as a lover. Not to illustrate exhaustively, three of"
3591,THE POET AS LOVER,"the most widely read poems with poet heroes, of the beginning, middle"
3592,THE POET AS LOVER,"and end of the century respectively, _i. e._, Moore's _Lalla"
3593,THE POET AS LOVER,"Rookh_, Mrs. Browning's _Lady Geraldine's Courtship_, and"
3594,THE POET AS LOVER,"Coventry Patmore's _The Angel in the House_, all depend for plot"
3595,THE POET AS LOVER,interest upon their hero's implication in a love affair. The authors'
3596,THE POET AS LOVER,"love affairs were invaluable, no doubt, since a poet is not be expected"
3597,THE POET AS LOVER,to treat adequately a passion which he has not experienced himself. It
3598,THE POET AS LOVER,"is true that one hears from time to time, notably in the 1890's, that"
3599,THE POET AS LOVER,"the artist should remain apart from, and coldly critical of the emotions"
3600,THE POET AS LOVER,he portrays. But this is not the typical attitude of our period. When
3601,THE POET AS LOVER,"one speaks thus, he is usually thought to be confusing the poet with the"
3602,THE POET AS LOVER,"literary man, who writes from calculation rather than from inspiration."
3603,THE POET AS LOVER,"The dictum of Aristotle, ""Those who feel emotion are most convincing"
3604,THE POET AS LOVER,"through a natural sympathy with the characters they represent,"""
3605,THE POET AS LOVER,"[Footnote: _Poetics_ XVII, Butcher's translation.] has appeared"
3606,THE POET AS LOVER,self-evident to most critics of our time.
3607,THE POET AS LOVER,
3608,THE POET AS LOVER,But the real question of inspiration by love goes deeper and is
3609,THE POET AS LOVER,"connected with Aristotle's further suggestion that poetry involves ""a"
3610,THE POET AS LOVER,"strain of madness,"" a statement which we are wont to interpret as"
3611,THE POET AS LOVER,meaning that the poet is led by his passions rather than by his reason.
3612,THE POET AS LOVER,This constitutes the gist of the whole dispute between the romanticist
3613,THE POET AS LOVER,"and the classicist, and our poets are such ardent devotees of love as"
3614,THE POET AS LOVER,"their muse, simply because, in spite of other short-lived fads, the"
3615,THE POET AS LOVER,temper of the last century has remained predominantly romantic. It is
3616,THE POET AS LOVER,obvious that the idea of love as a distraction and a curse is the
3617,THE POET AS LOVER,"offspring of classicism. If poetry is the work of the reason, then"
3618,THE POET AS LOVER,"equilibrium of soul, which is so sorely upset by passionate love, is"
3619,THE POET AS LOVER,"doubtless very necessary. But the romanticist represents the poet, not"
3620,THE POET AS LOVER,"as one drawing upon the resources within his mind, but as the vessel"
3621,THE POET AS LOVER,"filled from without. His afflatus comes upon him and departs, without"
3622,THE POET AS LOVER,"his control or understanding. Poetical inspiration, to such a"
3623,THE POET AS LOVER,"temperament, naturally assumes the shape of passion. Bryant's expression"
3624,THE POET AS LOVER,of this point of view is so typical of the general attitude as to seem
3625,THE POET AS LOVER,"merely commonplace. He tells us, in _The Poet_,"
3626,THE POET AS LOVER,
3627,THE POET AS LOVER,"No smooth array of phrase,"
3628,THE POET AS LOVER,"Artfully sought and ordered though it be,"
3629,THE POET AS LOVER,Which the cold rhymer lays
3630,THE POET AS LOVER,Upon his page languid industry
3631,THE POET AS LOVER,Can wake the listless pulse to livelier speed.
3632,THE POET AS LOVER,*       *       *       *       *
3633,THE POET AS LOVER,The secret wouldst thou know
3634,THE POET AS LOVER,To touch the heart or fire the blood at will?
3635,THE POET AS LOVER,Let thine own eyes o'erflow;
3636,THE POET AS LOVER,Let thy lips quiver with the passionate thrill.
3637,THE POET AS LOVER,"Seize the great thought, ere yet its power be past,"
3638,THE POET AS LOVER,"And bind, in words, the fleet emotion fast."
3639,THE POET AS LOVER,
3640,THE POET AS LOVER,"Coleridge's comprehension of this fact led him to cry, ""Love is the"
3641,THE POET AS LOVER,"vital air of my genius."" [Footnote: Letter to his wife, March 12, 1799.]"
3642,THE POET AS LOVER,
3643,THE POET AS LOVER,"All this, considering the usual subject-matter of poetry, is perhaps"
3644,THE POET AS LOVER,only saying that the poet must be sincere. The mathematician is most
3645,THE POET AS LOVER,"sincere when he uses his intellect exclusively, but a reasoned portrayal"
3646,THE POET AS LOVER,"of passion is bound to falsify, for it leads one insensibly either to"
3647,THE POET AS LOVER,"understate, or to burlesque, or to indulge in a psychopathic analysis of"
3648,THE POET AS LOVER,emotion. [Footnote: Of the latter type of poetry a good example is Edgar
3649,THE POET AS LOVER,Lee Masters' _Monsieur D---- and the Psycho-Analyst_.]
3650,THE POET AS LOVER,
3651,THE POET AS LOVER,"Accordingly, our poets have not been slow to remind us of their"
3652,THE POET AS LOVER,"passionate temperaments. Landor, perhaps, may oblige us to dip into his"
3653,THE POET AS LOVER,biography in order to verify our thesis that the poet is invariably
3654,THE POET AS LOVER,"passionate, but in many cases this state of things is reversed, the poet"
3655,THE POET AS LOVER,being wont to assure us that the conventional incidents of his life
3656,THE POET AS LOVER,afford no gauge of the ardors within his soul. Thus Wordsworth solemnly
3657,THE POET AS LOVER,"assures us,"
3658,THE POET AS LOVER,
3659,THE POET AS LOVER,"Had I been a writer of love poetry, it would have been natural to me to"
3660,THE POET AS LOVER,write with a degree of warmth which could hardly have been approved by
3661,THE POET AS LOVER,"my principles, and which might have been undesirable for the reader."
3662,THE POET AS LOVER,"[Footnote: See Arthur Symons, _The Romantic Movement_, p. 92 (from"
3663,THE POET AS LOVER,"Myers, _Life of Wordsworth_).]"
3664,THE POET AS LOVER,
3665,THE POET AS LOVER,"Such boasting is equally characteristic of our staid American poets, who"
3666,THE POET AS LOVER,shrink from the imputation that their orderly lives are the result of
3667,THE POET AS LOVER,"temperamental incapacity for unrestraint. [Footnote: Thus Whittier, in"
3668,THE POET AS LOVER,"_My Namesake_, says of himself,"
3669,THE POET AS LOVER,
3670,THE POET AS LOVER,Few guessed beneath his aspect grave
3671,THE POET AS LOVER,What passions strove in chains.
3672,THE POET AS LOVER,
3673,THE POET AS LOVER,"Also Bayard Taylor retorts to those who taunt him with lack of passion,"
3674,THE POET AS LOVER,
3675,THE POET AS LOVER,"But you are blind, and to the blind"
3676,THE POET AS LOVER,The touch of ice and fire is one.
3677,THE POET AS LOVER,
3678,THE POET AS LOVER,The same defense is made by Richard W. Gilder in lines entitled _Our
3679,THE POET AS LOVER,"Elder Poets_.] In differing mode, Swinburne's poetry is perhaps an"
3680,THE POET AS LOVER,expression of the same attitude. The ultra-erotic verse of that poet
3681,THE POET AS LOVER,somehow suggests a wild hullabaloo raised to divert our attention from
3682,THE POET AS LOVER,the fact that he was constitutionally incapable of experiencing passion.
3683,THE POET AS LOVER,
3684,THE POET AS LOVER,"Early in the century, something approaching the Wordsworthian doctrine"
3685,THE POET AS LOVER,"of emotion recollected in tranquillity was in vogue, as regards capacity"
3686,THE POET AS LOVER,for passion. The Byronic hero is one whose affections have burned
3687,THE POET AS LOVER,"themselves out, and who employs the last worthless years of his life"
3688,THE POET AS LOVER,writing them up. Childe Harold is
3689,THE POET AS LOVER,
3690,THE POET AS LOVER,"Grown aged in this world of woe,"
3691,THE POET AS LOVER,"In deeds, not years, piercing the depths of life,"
3692,THE POET AS LOVER,"So that no wonder waits him, nor below"
3693,THE POET AS LOVER,"Can love, or sorrow, fame, ambition, strife,"
3694,THE POET AS LOVER,Cut to his heart again with the keen knife
3695,THE POET AS LOVER,"Of silent, sharp endurance."
3696,THE POET AS LOVER,
3697,THE POET AS LOVER,"The very imitative hero of Praed's _The Troubadour_, after"
3698,THE POET AS LOVER,"disappointment in several successive amours, at the age of twenty-six"
3699,THE POET AS LOVER,dismisses passion forever. We are assured that
3700,THE POET AS LOVER,
3701,THE POET AS LOVER,"The joys that wound, the pains that bless,"
3702,THE POET AS LOVER,"Were all, were all departed,"
3703,THE POET AS LOVER,And he was wise and passionless
3704,THE POET AS LOVER,And happy and cold-hearted.
3705,THE POET AS LOVER,
3706,THE POET AS LOVER,"The popularity of this sort of poet was, however, ephemeral. Of late"
3707,THE POET AS LOVER,years poets have shown nothing but contempt for their brothers who
3708,THE POET AS LOVER,"attempt to sing after their passion has died away. It seems likely,"
3709,THE POET AS LOVER,"beside, that instead of giving an account of his genius, the depleted"
3710,THE POET AS LOVER,poet depicts his passionless state only as a ruse to gain the sympathy
3711,THE POET AS LOVER,"of his readers, reminding them how much greater he might have been if he"
3712,THE POET AS LOVER,had not wantonly wasted his emotions.
3713,THE POET AS LOVER,
3714,THE POET AS LOVER,"One is justified in asking why, on the other hand, the poet should not"
3715,THE POET AS LOVER,"be one who, instead of spending his love on a finite mistress, should"
3716,THE POET AS LOVER,devote it all to poetry. The bard asks us to believe that love of poetry
3717,THE POET AS LOVER,is as thrilling a passion as any earthly one. His usual emotions are
3718,THE POET AS LOVER,"portrayed in Alexander Smith's _Life Drama_, where the hero agonizes for"
3719,THE POET AS LOVER,relief from his too ardent love:
3720,THE POET AS LOVER,
3721,THE POET AS LOVER,O that my heart was quiet as a grave
3722,THE POET AS LOVER,Asleep in moonlight!
3723,THE POET AS LOVER,"For, as a torrid sunset boils with gold"
3724,THE POET AS LOVER,"Up to the zenith, fierce within my soul"
3725,THE POET AS LOVER,A passion burns from basement to the cope.
3726,THE POET AS LOVER,"Poesy, poesy!"
3727,THE POET AS LOVER,But one who imagines that this passion can exist in the soul wholly
3728,THE POET AS LOVER,"unrelated to any other, is confusing poetry with religion, or possibly"
3729,THE POET AS LOVER,with philosophy. The medieval saint was pure in proportion as he died to
3730,THE POET AS LOVER,the life of the senses. This is likewise the state of the philosopher
3731,THE POET AS LOVER,"described in the _Phaedo_. But beauty, unlike wisdom and goodness,"
3732,THE POET AS LOVER,"is not to be apprehended abstractly; ideal beauty is super-sensual, to"
3733,THE POET AS LOVER,"be sure, but the way to vision of it is through the senses. Without"
3734,THE POET AS LOVER,doubt one occasionally finds asceticism preached to the poet in verse.
3735,THE POET AS LOVER,"One of our minor American poets declares,"
3736,THE POET AS LOVER,
3737,THE POET AS LOVER,The bard who yields to flesh his emotion
3738,THE POET AS LOVER,Knows naught of the frenzy divine.
3739,THE POET AS LOVER,"[Footnote: _Passion_, by Elizabeth Cheney. But compare Keats' protest"
3740,THE POET AS LOVER,"against the poet's abstract love, in the fourth book of _Endymion_.]"
3741,THE POET AS LOVER,
3742,THE POET AS LOVER,But this is not the genuine poet's point of view. In so far as he is a
3743,THE POET AS LOVER,"Platonist--and ""all poets are more or less Platonists"" [Footnote: H. B."
3744,THE POET AS LOVER,"Alexander, _Poetry and the Individual_, p. 46.]--the poet is led upward"
3745,THE POET AS LOVER,to the love of ideal beauty through its incarnations in the world of
3746,THE POET AS LOVER,"sense. Thus in one of the most Platonic of our poems, G. E. Woodberry's"
3747,THE POET AS LOVER,"_Agathon_, Eros says of the hero, who is the young poet of the"
3748,THE POET AS LOVER,"_Symposium_,"
3749,THE POET AS LOVER,
3750,THE POET AS LOVER,"A spirit of joy he is, to beauty vowed,"
3751,THE POET AS LOVER,"Made to be loved, and every sluggish sense"
3752,THE POET AS LOVER,In him is amorous and passionate.
3753,THE POET AS LOVER,Whence danger is; therefore I seek him out
3754,THE POET AS LOVER,So with pure thought and care of things divine
3755,THE POET AS LOVER,To touch his soul that it partake the gods.
3756,THE POET AS LOVER,
3757,THE POET AS LOVER,This does not imply that romantic love is the only avenue to ideal
3758,THE POET AS LOVER,beauty. Rupert Brooke's _The Great Lover_ might dissipate such an
3759,THE POET AS LOVER,"idea, by its picture of childlike and omnivorous taste for"
3760,THE POET AS LOVER,sensuousbeauty.
3761,THE POET AS LOVER,
3762,THE POET AS LOVER,"These I have loved,"
3763,THE POET AS LOVER,
3764,THE POET AS LOVER,"Brooke begins,"
3765,THE POET AS LOVER,
3766,THE POET AS LOVER,"White plates and cups, clean gleaming,"
3767,THE POET AS LOVER,"Ringed with blue lines; and feathery, faery dust;"
3768,THE POET AS LOVER,"Wet roofs, beneath the lamplight; the strong crust"
3769,THE POET AS LOVER,Of friendly bread; and many tasting food;
3770,THE POET AS LOVER,"Rainbows, and the blue bitter smoke of wood."
3771,THE POET AS LOVER,
3772,THE POET AS LOVER,"And so on he takes us, apparently at random, through the whole range of"
3773,THE POET AS LOVER,his sense impressions. But the main difficulty with having no more than
3774,THE POET AS LOVER,such scattered and promiscuous impressionability is that it is likely to
3775,THE POET AS LOVER,"result in poetry that is a mere confusion of color without design,"
3776,THE POET AS LOVER,"unless the poet is subject to the unifying influence of a great passion,"
3777,THE POET AS LOVER,"which, far from destroying perspective, as was hinted previously,"
3778,THE POET AS LOVER,affords a fixed standard by which to gauge the relative values of other
3779,THE POET AS LOVER,"impressions. Of course the exceptionally idealistic poet, who is"
3780,THE POET AS LOVER,"conscious of a religious ideal, can say with Milton, ""I am wont day and"
3781,THE POET AS LOVER,night to seek the _idea_ of beauty through all the forms and faces
3782,THE POET AS LOVER,of things (for many are the shapes of things divine) and to follow it
3783,THE POET AS LOVER,"leading me on with certain assured traces."" [Footnote: _Prose"
3784,THE POET AS LOVER,"Works_, Vol. I, Letter VII, Symmons ed.] To him there is no need of"
3785,THE POET AS LOVER,the unifying influence of romantic love. In his case the mission of a
3786,THE POET AS LOVER,"strong passion is rather to humanize the ideal, lest it become purely"
3787,THE POET AS LOVER,philosophical (as that of G. E. Woodberry is in danger of doing) or
3788,THE POET AS LOVER,"purely ethical, as is the case of our New England poets. On the other"
3789,THE POET AS LOVER,"hand, to the poet who denies the ideal element in life altogether, the"
3790,THE POET AS LOVER,unifying influence of love is indispensable. Such deeply tragic poetry
3791,THE POET AS LOVER,"as that of James Thomson, B. V., for instance, which asserts Macbeth's"
3792,THE POET AS LOVER,"conclusion that life is ""a tale told by an idiot,"" is saved from utter"
3793,THE POET AS LOVER,"chaos sufficiently to keep its poetical character, only because the"
3794,THE POET AS LOVER,memory of his dead love gives Thomson a conception of eternal love and
3795,THE POET AS LOVER,beauty by which to gauge his hopeless despair.
3796,THE POET AS LOVER,
3797,THE POET AS LOVER,"In addition, our poets are wont to agree with their father Spenser that"
3798,THE POET AS LOVER,the beauty of a beloved person is not to be placed in the same class as
3799,THE POET AS LOVER,the beauty of the world of nature. Spenser argues that the spiritual
3800,THE POET AS LOVER,"beauty of a lady, rather than her outward appearance, causes her lover's"
3801,THE POET AS LOVER,perturbation. He inquires:
3802,THE POET AS LOVER,
3803,THE POET AS LOVER,Can proportion of the outward part
3804,THE POET AS LOVER,Move such affection in the inward mind
3805,THE POET AS LOVER,That it can rob both sense and reason blind?
3806,THE POET AS LOVER,"Why do not then the blossoms of the field,"
3807,THE POET AS LOVER,Which are arrayed with much more orient hue
3808,THE POET AS LOVER,"And to the sense most daintie odors yield,"
3809,THE POET AS LOVER,Work like impression in the looker's view?
3810,THE POET AS LOVER,[Footnote: _An Hymne in Honour of Beautie_.]
3811,THE POET AS LOVER,
3812,THE POET AS LOVER,"Modern theorists, who would no doubt despise the quaintly idealistic"
3813,THE POET AS LOVER,"mode of Spenser's expression, yet express much the same view in"
3814,THE POET AS LOVER,asserting that romantic excitement is a stimulus which keys all the
3815,THE POET AS LOVER,"senses to a higher pitch, thus dispersing one's amorousness over all"
3816,THE POET AS LOVER,"creation. The love celebrated in Brooke's _The Great Lover_, they"
3817,THE POET AS LOVER,"declare, cannot be compared with that of his more conventional love"
3818,THE POET AS LOVER,"poems, simply because the one love is the cause of the other. Such"
3819,THE POET AS LOVER,heightened sensuous impressionability is celebrated in much of our most
3820,THE POET AS LOVER,"beautiful love poetry of to-day, notably in Sara Teasdale's."
3821,THE POET AS LOVER,
3822,THE POET AS LOVER,It may be that this intensity of perception engendered by love is its
3823,THE POET AS LOVER,most poetical effect. Much verse pictures the poet as a flamelike spirit
3824,THE POET AS LOVER,kindled by love to a preternaturally vivid apprehension of life for an
3825,THE POET AS LOVER,"instant, before love dies away, leaving him ashes. Again and again the"
3826,THE POET AS LOVER,analogy is pointed out between Shelley's spirit and the leaping flames
3827,THE POET AS LOVER,that consumed his body. Josephine Preston Peabody's interpretation of
3828,THE POET AS LOVER,Marlowe is of the same sort. In the drama of which Marlowe is the
3829,THE POET AS LOVER,"title-character, his fellow-dramatist, Lodge, is much worried when he"
3830,THE POET AS LOVER,learns of Marlowe's mad passion for a woman of the court.
3831,THE POET AS LOVER,
3832,THE POET AS LOVER,"Thou art a glorious madman,"
3833,THE POET AS LOVER,
3834,THE POET AS LOVER,"Lodge exclaims,"
3835,THE POET AS LOVER,
3836,THE POET AS LOVER,"Born to consume thyself anon in ashes,"
3837,THE POET AS LOVER,And rise again to immortality.
3838,THE POET AS LOVER,
3839,THE POET AS LOVER,"Marlowe replies,"
3840,THE POET AS LOVER,
3841,THE POET AS LOVER,"Oh, if she cease to smile, as thy looks say,"
3842,THE POET AS LOVER,What if? I shall have drained my splendor down
3843,THE POET AS LOVER,"To the last flaming drop! Then take me, darkness,"
3844,THE POET AS LOVER,"And mirk and mire and black oblivion,"
3845,THE POET AS LOVER,"Despairs that raven where no camp-fire is,"
3846,THE POET AS LOVER,Like the wild beasts. I shall be even blest
3847,THE POET AS LOVER,To be so damned.
3848,THE POET AS LOVER,
3849,THE POET AS LOVER,Most often this conception of love's flamelike lightening of life for
3850,THE POET AS LOVER,the poet is applied to Sappho. Many modern English poets picture her
3851,THE POET AS LOVER,"living ""with the swift singing strength of fire."" [Footnote: See"
3852,THE POET AS LOVER,"Southey, _Sappho_; Mary Robinson (1758-1800), _Sappho and Phaon_; Philip"
3853,THE POET AS LOVER,"Moren Freneau, _Monument of Phaon_; James Gates Percival, _Sappho_;"
3854,THE POET AS LOVER,"Charles Kingsley, _Sappho_; Lord Houghton, _A Dream of Sappho_;"

3857,THE POET AS LOVER,"and Phaon_; Zoë Akins, _Sappho to a Swallow on the Ground_; James B."

3859,THE POET AS LOVER,"Percy, _Sappho in Levkos_ (1920).] Swinburne, in _On the Cliffs_, claims"
3860,THE POET AS LOVER,"this as the essential attribute of genius, when he cries to her for"
3861,THE POET AS LOVER,"sympathy,"
3862,THE POET AS LOVER,
3863,THE POET AS LOVER,For all my days as all thy days from birth
3864,THE POET AS LOVER,My heart as thy heart was in me as thee
3865,THE POET AS LOVER,"Fire, and not all the fountains of the sea"
3866,THE POET AS LOVER,Have waves enough to quench it; nor on earth
3867,THE POET AS LOVER,"Is fuel enough to feed,"
3868,THE POET AS LOVER,"While day sows night, and night sows day for seed."
3869,THE POET AS LOVER,
3870,THE POET AS LOVER,"This intensity of perception is largely the result, or the cause, of the"
3871,THE POET AS LOVER,poet's unusually sensitive consciousness of the ephemeralness of love.
3872,THE POET AS LOVER,The notion of permanence often seems to rob love of all its poetical
3873,THE POET AS LOVER,quality. The dark despair engendered by a sense of its transience is
3874,THE POET AS LOVER,"needed as a foil to the fiery splendors of passion. Thus Rupert Brooke,"
3875,THE POET AS LOVER,"in the sonnet, _Mutability_, dismisses the Platonic idea of eternal"
3876,THE POET AS LOVER,"love and beauty, declaring,"
3877,THE POET AS LOVER,
3878,THE POET AS LOVER,"Dear, we know only that we sigh, kiss, smile;"
3879,THE POET AS LOVER,Each kiss lasts but the kissing; and grief goes over;
3880,THE POET AS LOVER,Love has no habitation but the heart:
3881,THE POET AS LOVER,"Poor straws! on the dark flood we catch awhile,"
3882,THE POET AS LOVER,"Cling, and are borne into the night apart,"
3883,THE POET AS LOVER,"The laugh dies with the lips, ""Love"" with the lover."
3884,THE POET AS LOVER,
3885,THE POET AS LOVER,Sappho is represented as especially aware of this aspect of her love.
3886,THE POET AS LOVER,"Her frenzies in _Anactoria_, where, if our hypothesis is correct,"
3887,THE POET AS LOVER,"Swinburne must have been terribly concerned over his natural coldness,"
3888,THE POET AS LOVER,"arise from rebellion at the brevity of love. Sappho cries,"
3889,THE POET AS LOVER,
3890,THE POET AS LOVER,What had all we done
3891,THE POET AS LOVER,"That we should live and loathe the sterile sun,"
3892,THE POET AS LOVER,"And with the moon wax paler as she wanes,"
3893,THE POET AS LOVER,And pulse by pulse feel time grow through our veins?
3894,THE POET AS LOVER,
3895,THE POET AS LOVER,"Poetry, we are to believe, arises from the yearning to render eternal"
3896,THE POET AS LOVER,"the fleeting moment of passion. Sappho's poetry is, as Swinburne says,"
3897,THE POET AS LOVER,"[Footnote: In _On the Cliffs_.] ""life everlasting of eternal fire."""
3898,THE POET AS LOVER,"In Mackaye's _Sappho and Phaon_, she exults in her power to"
3899,THE POET AS LOVER,"immortalize her passion, contrasting herself with her mother, the sea:"
3900,THE POET AS LOVER,
3901,THE POET AS LOVER,"Her ways are birth, fecundity and death,"
3902,THE POET AS LOVER,But mine are beauty and immortal love.
3903,THE POET AS LOVER,Therefore I will be tyrant of myself--
3904,THE POET AS LOVER,Mine own law will I be! And I will make
3905,THE POET AS LOVER,"Creatures of mind and melody, whose forms"
3906,THE POET AS LOVER,"Are wrought of loveliness without decay,"
3907,THE POET AS LOVER,"And wild desire without satiety,"
3908,THE POET AS LOVER,And joy and aspiration without death.
3909,THE POET AS LOVER,"And on the wings of these shall I, I, Sappho!"
3910,THE POET AS LOVER,"Still soar and sing above these cliffs of Lesbos,"
3911,THE POET AS LOVER,Even when ten thousand blooms of men and maidens
3912,THE POET AS LOVER,Are fallen and withered.
3913,THE POET AS LOVER,
3914,THE POET AS LOVER,"To one who craves an absolute aesthetic standard, it is satisfactory to"
3915,THE POET AS LOVER,note how nearly unanimous our poets are in their portrayal of Sappho.
3916,THE POET AS LOVER,[Footnote: No doubt they are influenced by the glimpse of her given in
3917,THE POET AS LOVER,"Longinus, _On the Sublime_.] This is the more remarkable, since our"
3918,THE POET AS LOVER,enormous ignorance of her life and poetry would give almost free scope
3919,THE POET AS LOVER,to inventive faculty. It is significant that none of our writers have
3920,THE POET AS LOVER,been attracted to the picture Welcker gives of her as the respectable
3921,THE POET AS LOVER,"matronly head of a girl's seminary. Instead, she is invariably shown as"
3922,THE POET AS LOVER,"mad with an insatiable yearning, tortured by the conviction that her"
3923,THE POET AS LOVER,"love can never be satisfied. Charles Kingsley, describing her"
3924,THE POET AS LOVER,"temperament,"
3925,THE POET AS LOVER,
3926,THE POET AS LOVER,Night and day
3927,THE POET AS LOVER,"A mighty hunger yearned within her heart,"
3928,THE POET AS LOVER,"And all her veins ran fever,"
3929,THE POET AS LOVER,[Footnote: _Sappho_.]
3930,THE POET AS LOVER,
3931,THE POET AS LOVER,"conceives of her much as does Swinburne, who calls her,"
3932,THE POET AS LOVER,
3933,THE POET AS LOVER,"Love's priestess, mad with pain and joy of song,"
3934,THE POET AS LOVER,"Song's priestess, mad with pain and joy of love."
3935,THE POET AS LOVER,[Footnote: _On the Cliffs_.]
3936,THE POET AS LOVER,
3937,THE POET AS LOVER,It is in this insatiability that Swinburne finds the secret of her
3938,THE POET AS LOVER,"genius, as opposed to the meager desires of ordinary folk. Expressing"
3939,THE POET AS LOVER,"her conception of God, he makes Sappho assert,"
3940,THE POET AS LOVER,
3941,THE POET AS LOVER,"But having made me, me he shall not slay:"
3942,THE POET AS LOVER,"Nor slay nor satiate, like those herds of his,"
3943,THE POET AS LOVER,"Who laugh and love a little, and their kiss"
3944,THE POET AS LOVER,Contents them.
3945,THE POET AS LOVER,
3946,THE POET AS LOVER,"It is, no doubt, an inarticulate conviction that she is ""imprisoned in"
3947,THE POET AS LOVER,"the body as in an oyster shell,"" [Footnote: Plato, _Phaedrus_, § 250.]"
3948,THE POET AS LOVER,while the force that is wooing her is outside the boundary of the
3949,THE POET AS LOVER,"senses, that accounts for Sappho's agonies of despair. In Sara"
3950,THE POET AS LOVER,"Teasdale's _Sappho_ she describes herself,"
3951,THE POET AS LOVER,
3952,THE POET AS LOVER,Who would run at dusk
3953,THE POET AS LOVER,Along the surges creeping up the shore
3954,THE POET AS LOVER,"When tides come in to ease the hungry beach,"
3955,THE POET AS LOVER,"And running, running till the night was black,"
3956,THE POET AS LOVER,"Would fall forspent upon the chilly sand,"
3957,THE POET AS LOVER,And quiver with the winds from off the sea.
3958,THE POET AS LOVER,Ah! quietly the shingle waits the tides
3959,THE POET AS LOVER,"Whose waves are stinging kisses, but to me"
3960,THE POET AS LOVER,"Love brought no peace, nor darkness any rest."
3961,THE POET AS LOVER,"[Footnote: In the end, Sara Teasdale does show her winning content,"
3962,THE POET AS LOVER,"in the love of her baby daughter, but it is significant that this"
3963,THE POET AS LOVER,"destroys her lyric gift. She assures Aphrodite,"
3964,THE POET AS LOVER,
3965,THE POET AS LOVER,If I sing no more
3966,THE POET AS LOVER,"To thee, God's daughter, powerful as God,"
3967,THE POET AS LOVER,It is that thou hast made my life too sweet
3968,THE POET AS LOVER,To hold the added sweetness of a song.
3969,THE POET AS LOVER,*       *       *       *       *
3970,THE POET AS LOVER,I taught the world thy music; now alone
3971,THE POET AS LOVER,I sing for her who falls asleep to hear.]
3972,THE POET AS LOVER,
3973,THE POET AS LOVER,Swinburne characteristically shows her literally tearing the flesh in
3974,THE POET AS LOVER,her quest of the divinity that is reflected there. In _Anactoria_
3975,THE POET AS LOVER,she tells the object of her infatuation:
3976,THE POET AS LOVER,
3977,THE POET AS LOVER,I would my love could kill thee: I am satiated
3978,THE POET AS LOVER,"With seeing thee alive, and fain would have thee dead."
3979,THE POET AS LOVER,*       *       *       *       *
3980,THE POET AS LOVER,"I would find grievous ways to have thee slain,"
3981,THE POET AS LOVER,Intense device and superflux of pain.
3982,THE POET AS LOVER,
3983,THE POET AS LOVER,And after detailing with gusto the bloody ingenuities of her plan of
3984,THE POET AS LOVER,"torture, she states that her motive is,"
3985,THE POET AS LOVER,
3986,THE POET AS LOVER,To wring thy very spirit through the flesh.
3987,THE POET AS LOVER,
3988,THE POET AS LOVER,"The myth that Sappho's agony resulted from an offense done to Aphrodite,"
3989,THE POET AS LOVER,is several times alluded to. In _Sappho and Phaon_ she asserts her
3990,THE POET AS LOVER,"independence of Aphrodite's good will, and in revenge the goddess turns"
3991,THE POET AS LOVER,"Phaon's affection away from Sappho, back to Thalassa, the mother of his"
3992,THE POET AS LOVER,"children. Sappho's infatuation for Phaon, the slave, seems a cruel jest"
3993,THE POET AS LOVER,"of Aphrodite, who fills Sappho with a wholly blind and unreasoning"
3994,THE POET AS LOVER,"passion. In all three of Swinburne's Lesbian poems, Aphrodite's anger is"
3995,THE POET AS LOVER,"mentioned. This is the sole theme of _Sapphics_, in which poem the"
3996,THE POET AS LOVER,"goddess, displeased by Sappho's preferment of love poetry to the actual"
3997,THE POET AS LOVER,"delights of love, yet tried to win Sappho back to her:"
3998,THE POET AS LOVER,
3999,THE POET AS LOVER,"Called to her, saying ""Turn to me, O my Sappho,"""
4000,THE POET AS LOVER,"Yet she turned her face from the Loves, she saw not"
4001,THE POET AS LOVER,Tears or laughter darken immortal eyelids....
4002,THE POET AS LOVER,"Only saw the beautiful lips and fingers,"
4003,THE POET AS LOVER,"Full of songs and kisses and little whispers,"
4004,THE POET AS LOVER,Full of music; only beheld among them
4005,THE POET AS LOVER,Soar as a bird soars
4006,THE POET AS LOVER,"Newly fledged, her visible song, a marvel"
4007,THE POET AS LOVER,"Made of perfect sound and exceeding passion,"
4008,THE POET AS LOVER,"Sweetly shapen, terrible, full of thunders,"
4009,THE POET AS LOVER,Clothed with the wind's wings.
4010,THE POET AS LOVER,
4011,THE POET AS LOVER,It seems likely that this myth of Aphrodite's anger is an allegory
4012,THE POET AS LOVER,"indicating the tragic character of all poetic love, in that, while"
4013,THE POET AS LOVER,"incarcerated in the body, the singer strives to break through the limits"
4014,THE POET AS LOVER,of the flesh and to grasp ideality. The issue is made clear in Mackaye's
4015,THE POET AS LOVER,"drama. There Sappho's rival is Thalassa, Phaon's slave-mate, who"
4016,THE POET AS LOVER,"conceives as love's only culmination the bearing of children. Sappho, in"
4017,THE POET AS LOVER,"her superiority, points out that mere perpetuation of physical life is a"
4018,THE POET AS LOVER,"meaningless circle, unless it leads to some higher satisfaction. But in"
4019,THE POET AS LOVER,"the end the figure of ""the eternal mother,"" as typified by Thalassa, is"
4020,THE POET AS LOVER,"more powerful than is Sappho, in the struggle for Phaon's love. Thus"
4021,THE POET AS LOVER,Aphrodite asserts her unwillingness to have love refined into a merely
4022,THE POET AS LOVER,spiritual conception.
4023,THE POET AS LOVER,
4024,THE POET AS LOVER,"Often the greatest poets, as Sappho herself, are represented as having"
4025,THE POET AS LOVER,no more than a blind and instinctive apprehension of the supersensual
4026,THE POET AS LOVER,"beauty which is shining through the flesh, and which is the real object"
4027,THE POET AS LOVER,"of desire. But thus much ideality must be characteristic of love, it"
4028,THE POET AS LOVER,"seems obvious, before it can be spiritually creative. Unless there is"
4029,THE POET AS LOVER,"some sense of a universal force, taking the shape of the individual"
4030,THE POET AS LOVER,"loved one, there can be nothing suggestive in love. Instead of waking"
4031,THE POET AS LOVER,"the lover to the beauty in all of life, as we have said, it would, as"
4032,THE POET AS LOVER,"the non-lover has asserted, blind him to all but the immediate object of"
4033,THE POET AS LOVER,"his pursuit. Then, the goal being reached, there would be no reason for"
4034,THE POET AS LOVER,"the poet's not achieving complete satisfaction in love, for there would"
4035,THE POET AS LOVER,be nothing in it to suggest any delight that he does not possess.
4036,THE POET AS LOVER,"Therefore, having all his desire, the lover would be lethargic, with no"
4037,THE POET AS LOVER,impulse to express himself in song. Probably something of this sort is
4038,THE POET AS LOVER,"the meaning of the Tannhauser legend, as versified both by Owen Meredith"
4039,THE POET AS LOVER,"and Emma Lazarus, showing the poet robbed of his gift when he comes"
4040,THE POET AS LOVER,under the power of the Paphian Venus. Such likewise is probably the
4041,THE POET AS LOVER,"meaning of Oscar Wilde's sonnet, _Hélas_, quoted above."
4042,THE POET AS LOVER,
4043,THE POET AS LOVER,"While we thus lightly dismiss sensual love as unpoetical, we must"
4044,THE POET AS LOVER,"remember that Burns, in some of his accounts of inspiration, ascribes"
4045,THE POET AS LOVER,quite as powerful and as unidealistic an effect to the kisses of the
4046,THE POET AS LOVER,"barmaids, as to the liquor they dispense. But this is mere bravado, as"
4047,THE POET AS LOVER,"much of his other verse shows. Byron's case, also, is a doubtful one."
4048,THE POET AS LOVER,The element of discontent is all that elevates his amours above the
4049,THE POET AS LOVER,"""swinish trough,"" which Alfred Austin asserts them to be. [Footnote: In"
4050,THE POET AS LOVER,"_Off Mesolonghi_.] Yet, such as his idealism is, it constitutes the"
4051,THE POET AS LOVER,"strength and weakness of his poetical gift. Landor well says, [Footnote:"
4052,THE POET AS LOVER,In _Lines To a Lady_.]
4053,THE POET AS LOVER,
4054,THE POET AS LOVER,Although by fits so dense a cloud of smoke
4055,THE POET AS LOVER,"Puffs from his sappy and ill-seasoned oak,"
4056,THE POET AS LOVER,"Yet, as the spirit of the dream draws near,"
4057,THE POET AS LOVER,Remembered loves make Byron's self sincere.
4058,THE POET AS LOVER,"The puny heart within him swells to view,"
4059,THE POET AS LOVER,The man grows loftier and the poet too.
4060,THE POET AS LOVER,
4061,THE POET AS LOVER,Ideal love is most likely to become articulate in the sonnet sequence.
4062,THE POET AS LOVER,"The Platonic theory of love and beauty, ubiquitous in renaissance"
4063,THE POET AS LOVER,"sonnets, is less pretentiously but no less sincerely present in the"
4064,THE POET AS LOVER,finest sonnets of the last century. The sense that the beauty of his
4065,THE POET AS LOVER,"beloved is that of all other fair forms, the motive of Shakespeare's"
4066,THE POET AS LOVER,
4067,THE POET AS LOVER,Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts
4068,THE POET AS LOVER,"Which I by lacking have supposed dead,"
4069,THE POET AS LOVER,
4070,THE POET AS LOVER,"is likewise the motive of Rossetti's _Heart's Compass_,"
4071,THE POET AS LOVER,
4072,THE POET AS LOVER,"Sometimes thou seemest not as thyself alone,"
4073,THE POET AS LOVER,But as the meaning of all things that are;
4074,THE POET AS LOVER,"A breathless wonder, shadowing forth afar"
4075,THE POET AS LOVER,"Some heavenly solstice, hushed and halcyon,"
4076,THE POET AS LOVER,Whose unstirred lips are music's visible tone;
4077,THE POET AS LOVER,"Whose eyes the sungates of the soul unbar,"
4078,THE POET AS LOVER,"Being of its furthest fires oracular,"
4079,THE POET AS LOVER,The evident heart of all life sown and mown.
4080,THE POET AS LOVER,
4081,THE POET AS LOVER,"Thus also Mrs. Browning says of her earlier ideal loves,"
4082,THE POET AS LOVER,
4083,THE POET AS LOVER,"Their shining fronts,"
4084,THE POET AS LOVER,"Their songs, their splendors (better, yet the same,"
4085,THE POET AS LOVER,As river water hallowed into founts)
4086,THE POET AS LOVER,Met in thee.
4087,THE POET AS LOVER,"[Footnote: _Sonnets of the Portuguese_, XXVI.]"
4088,THE POET AS LOVER,
4089,THE POET AS LOVER,Reflection of this sort almost inevitably leads the poet to the
4090,THE POET AS LOVER,conviction that his real love is eternal beauty. Such is the progress of
4091,THE POET AS LOVER,Rossetti's thought in _Heart's Hope_:
4092,THE POET AS LOVER,
4093,THE POET AS LOVER,"Lady, I fain would tell how evermore"
4094,THE POET AS LOVER,Thy soul I know not from thy body nor
4095,THE POET AS LOVER,"Thee from myself, neither our love from God."
4096,THE POET AS LOVER,
4097,THE POET AS LOVER,The whole of Diotima's theory of the ascent to ideal beauty is here
4098,THE POET AS LOVER,implicit in three lines. In the same spirit Christina Rossetti
4099,THE POET AS LOVER,identifies her lover with her Christian faith:
4100,THE POET AS LOVER,
4101,THE POET AS LOVER,"Yea, as I apprehend it, love is such"
4102,THE POET AS LOVER,"I cannot love you if I love not Him,"
4103,THE POET AS LOVER,I cannot love Him if I love not you.
4104,THE POET AS LOVER,"[Footnote: _Monna Innominata_, VI. See also Robert Bridges, _The of"
4105,THE POET AS LOVER,Love_ (a sonnet sequence).]
4106,THE POET AS LOVER,
4107,THE POET AS LOVER,"It is obvious that, from the standpoint of the beloved at least, there"
4108,THE POET AS LOVER,is danger in this identification of all beauties as manifestations of
4109,THE POET AS LOVER,the ideal. It is unpropitious to lifelong affection for one person. As a
4110,THE POET AS LOVER,"matter of fact, though the English taste for decorous fidelity has"
4111,THE POET AS LOVER,"affected some poets, on the whole they have not hesitated to picture"
4112,THE POET AS LOVER,their race as fickle. Plato's account of the second step in the ascent
4113,THE POET AS LOVER,"of the lover, ""Soon he will himself perceive that the beauty of one form"
4114,THE POET AS LOVER,is truly related to the beauty of another; and then if beauty in general
4115,THE POET AS LOVER,"is his pursuit, how foolish would he be not to recognize that the beauty"
4116,THE POET AS LOVER,"in every form is one and the same,"" [Footnote: _Symposium_, Jowett"
4117,THE POET AS LOVER,"translation, §210.] is made by Shelley the justification of his shifting"
4118,THE POET AS LOVER,"enthusiasms, which the world so harshly censured. In _Epipsychidion_"
4119,THE POET AS LOVER,"Shelley declares,"
4120,THE POET AS LOVER,
4121,THE POET AS LOVER,I never was attached to that great sect
4122,THE POET AS LOVER,Whose doctrine is that each one should select
4123,THE POET AS LOVER,"Out of the crowd a mistress or a friend,"
4124,THE POET AS LOVER,"And all the rest, though fair and wise, commend"
4125,THE POET AS LOVER,To cold oblivion....
4126,THE POET AS LOVER,
4127,THE POET AS LOVER,"True love in this differs from gold and clay,"
4128,THE POET AS LOVER,That to divide is not to take away.
4129,THE POET AS LOVER,"Love is like understanding, that grows bright"
4130,THE POET AS LOVER,Gazing on many truths....

4133,THE POET AS LOVER,"The life that wears, the spirit that creates"
4134,THE POET AS LOVER,"One object and one form, and builds thereby"
4135,THE POET AS LOVER,A sepulchre for its eternity.
4136,THE POET AS LOVER,
4137,THE POET AS LOVER,"These last lines suggest, what many poets have asserted, that the"
4138,THE POET AS LOVER,goddess of beauty is apt to change her habitation from one clay to
4139,THE POET AS LOVER,"another, and that the poet who clings to the fair form after she has"
4140,THE POET AS LOVER,"departed, is nauseated by the dead bones which he clasps. [Footnote: See"
4141,THE POET AS LOVER,"Thomas Hardy's novel, _The Well Beloved_.] This theme Rupert Brooke"
4142,THE POET AS LOVER,"is constantly harping upon, notably in _Dead Men's Love_, which"
4143,THE POET AS LOVER,"begins,"
4144,THE POET AS LOVER,
4145,THE POET AS LOVER,"There was a damned successful poet,"
4146,THE POET AS LOVER,There was a woman like the Sun.
4147,THE POET AS LOVER,And they were dead. They did not know it.
4148,THE POET AS LOVER,They did not know his hymns
4149,THE POET AS LOVER,Were silence; and her limbs
4150,THE POET AS LOVER,"That had served love so well,"
4151,THE POET AS LOVER,"Dust, and a filthy smell."
4152,THE POET AS LOVER,
4153,THE POET AS LOVER,The feeling that Aphrodite is leading them a merry chase through
4154,THE POET AS LOVER,"manyforms is characteristic of our ultra-modern poets, who anticipate at"
4155,THE POET AS LOVER,least one new love affair a year. Most elegantly Ezra Pound expresses
4156,THE POET AS LOVER,his feeling that it is time to move on to a fresh inspiration:
4157,THE POET AS LOVER,
4158,THE POET AS LOVER,As a bathtub lined with white porcelain
4159,THE POET AS LOVER,"When the hot water gives out or goes tepid,--"
4160,THE POET AS LOVER,"So is the slow cooling of our chivalrous passion,"
4161,THE POET AS LOVER,"My much praised, but not altogether satisfactory lady."
4162,THE POET AS LOVER,
4163,THE POET AS LOVER,As each beautiful form is to be conceived of as reflecting eternal
4164,THE POET AS LOVER,"beauty from a slightly different angle, the poet may claim that flitting"
4165,THE POET AS LOVER,affection is necessary to one who would gain as complete as possible
4166,THE POET AS LOVER,"vision of ideality. Not only so, but this glimpsing of beauty through"
4167,THE POET AS LOVER,"first one mistress, then another, often seems to perform the function of"
4168,THE POET AS LOVER,the mixed metaphor in freeing the soul from bondage to the sensual. This
4169,THE POET AS LOVER,is the interpretation of Sappho's fickleness most popular with our
4170,THE POET AS LOVER,"writers, who give her the consciousness that Aphrodite, not flesh and"
4171,THE POET AS LOVER,"blood, is the object of her quest. In her case, unlike that of the"
4172,THE POET AS LOVER,"ordinary lover, the new passion does not involve the repudiation or"
4173,THE POET AS LOVER,belittling of the one before. In Swinburne's _Anactoria_ Sappho
4174,THE POET AS LOVER,compares her sensations
4175,THE POET AS LOVER,
4176,THE POET AS LOVER,"Last year when I loved Atthis, and this year"
4177,THE POET AS LOVER,When I love thee.
4178,THE POET AS LOVER,
4179,THE POET AS LOVER,"In Mackaye's _Sappho and Phaon_, when Alcaeus pleads for the love"
4180,THE POET AS LOVER,"of the poetess, she asserts of herself,"
4181,THE POET AS LOVER,
4182,THE POET AS LOVER,I doubt if ever she saw form of man
4183,THE POET AS LOVER,"Or maiden either whom, being beautiful,"
4184,THE POET AS LOVER,She hath not loved.
4185,THE POET AS LOVER,
4186,THE POET AS LOVER,"When Alcaeus protests, ""But not with passion!"" she rejoins,"
4187,THE POET AS LOVER,
4188,THE POET AS LOVER,All
4189,THE POET AS LOVER,"That breathes to her is passion, love itself"
4190,THE POET AS LOVER,All passionate.
4191,THE POET AS LOVER,
4192,THE POET AS LOVER,"The inevitability of fickleness arising from her idealism, which fills"
4193,THE POET AS LOVER,"her with insuperable discontent, is voiced most clearly by the"
4194,THE POET AS LOVER,"nineteenth century Sappho through the lips of Sara Teasdale, in lines"
4195,THE POET AS LOVER,wherein she dismisses those who gossip about her:
4196,THE POET AS LOVER,
4197,THE POET AS LOVER,How should they know that Sappho lived and died
4198,THE POET AS LOVER,"Faithful to love, not faithful to the lover,"
4199,THE POET AS LOVER,"Never transfused and lost in what she loved,"
4200,THE POET AS LOVER,Never so wholly loving nor at peace.
4201,THE POET AS LOVER,"I asked for something greater than I found,"
4202,THE POET AS LOVER,And every time that love has made me weep
4203,THE POET AS LOVER,I have rejoiced that love could be so strong;
4204,THE POET AS LOVER,For I have stood apart and watched my soul
4205,THE POET AS LOVER,Caught in a gust of passion as a bird
4206,THE POET AS LOVER,With baffled wings against the dusty whirlwind
4207,THE POET AS LOVER,Struggles and frees itself to find the sky.
4208,THE POET AS LOVER,
4209,THE POET AS LOVER,"She continues, apostrophizing beauty,"
4210,THE POET AS LOVER,
4211,THE POET AS LOVER,In many guises didst thou come to me;
4212,THE POET AS LOVER,"I saw thee by the maidens when they danced,"
4213,THE POET AS LOVER,"Phaon allured me with a look of thine,"
4214,THE POET AS LOVER,In Anactoria I knew thy grace.
4215,THE POET AS LOVER,"I looked at Cercolas and saw thine eyes,"
4216,THE POET AS LOVER,"But never wholly, soul and body mine"
4217,THE POET AS LOVER,Didst thou bid any love me as I loved.
4218,THE POET AS LOVER,
4219,THE POET AS LOVER,"The last two lines suggest another reason for the fickleness, as well as"
4220,THE POET AS LOVER,for the insatiability of the poet's love. If the poet's genius consists
4221,THE POET AS LOVER,"of his peculiar capacity for love, then in proportion as he outsoars the"
4222,THE POET AS LOVER,"rest of humanity he will be saddened, if not disillusioned, by the"
4223,THE POET AS LOVER,half-hearted return of his love. Mrs. Browning characterizes her
4224,THE POET AS LOVER,passion:
4225,THE POET AS LOVER,
4226,THE POET AS LOVER,I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
4227,THE POET AS LOVER,"My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight"
4228,THE POET AS LOVER,For the ends of Being and ideal grace.
4229,THE POET AS LOVER,
4230,THE POET AS LOVER,It is clear that a lesser soul could not possibly give an adequate
4231,THE POET AS LOVER,response to such affection. Perhaps it is one of the strongest evidences
4232,THE POET AS LOVER,"that Browning is a genuine philosopher, and not a prestidigitator of"
4233,THE POET AS LOVER,"philosophy in rhyme, that Mrs. Browning's love poetry does not conclude"
4234,THE POET AS LOVER,with the note either of tragic insatiability or of disillusionment.
4235,THE POET AS LOVER,[Footnote: The tragedy of incapacity to return one's poet-lover's
4236,THE POET AS LOVER,passion is the theme of Alice Meynell's _The Poet and his Wife_. On
4237,THE POET AS LOVER,"the same theme are the following: Amelia Josephine Burr, _Anne"
4238,THE POET AS LOVER,"Hathaway's Cottage_ (1914); C. J. Druce, _The Dark Lady to Shakespeare_"

4241,THE POET AS LOVER,
4242,THE POET AS LOVER,"Since the poet's soul is more beautiful than the souls of other men, it"
4243,THE POET AS LOVER,"follows that he cannot love at all except, in a sense, by virtue of the"
4244,THE POET AS LOVER,fact that he is easily deceived. Here is another explanation of the
4245,THE POET AS LOVER,"transience of his affections,--in his horrified recoil from an unworthy"
4246,THE POET AS LOVER,object that he has idealized. This blindness to sensuality is accounted
4247,THE POET AS LOVER,"for by Plato in the figure, ""The lover is his mirror in whom he is"
4248,THE POET AS LOVER,"beholding himself, but he is not aware of this."" [Footnote: _Phædrus_,"
4249,THE POET AS LOVER,"255.] [Footnote: Browning shows the poet, with his eyes open, loving an"
4250,THE POET AS LOVER,"unworthy form, in _Time's Revenges_.] This is the figure used in Sara"
4251,THE POET AS LOVER,"Teasdale's little poem, _The Star_, which says to the pool,"
4252,THE POET AS LOVER,
4253,THE POET AS LOVER,"O wondrous deep,"
4254,THE POET AS LOVER,"I love you, I give you my light to keep."
4255,THE POET AS LOVER,"Oh, more profound than the moving sea,"
4256,THE POET AS LOVER,That never has shown myself to me.

4258,THE POET AS LOVER,But out of the woods as night grew cool
4259,THE POET AS LOVER,A brown pig came to the little pool;
4260,THE POET AS LOVER,It grunted and splashed and waded in

4263,THE POET AS LOVER,"The tragedy in such love is the theme of Alfred Noyes' poem on Marlowe,"
4264,THE POET AS LOVER,_At the Sign of the Golden Shoe_. The dramatist comes to London as
4265,THE POET AS LOVER,"a young boy, full of high visions and faith in human nature. His"
4266,THE POET AS LOVER,innocence makes him easy prey of a notorious woman:
4267,THE POET AS LOVER,
4268,THE POET AS LOVER,"In her treacherous eyes,"
4269,THE POET AS LOVER,"As in dark pools the mirrored stars will gleam,"
4270,THE POET AS LOVER,Here did he see his own eternal skies.
4271,THE POET AS LOVER,
4272,THE POET AS LOVER,"But, since his love is wholly spiritual, it dies on the instant of her"
4273,THE POET AS LOVER,revelation of her character:
4274,THE POET AS LOVER,
4275,THE POET AS LOVER,"Clasped in the bitter grave of that sweet clay,"
4276,THE POET AS LOVER,"Wedded and one with it, he moaned."
4277,THE POET AS LOVER,*     *     *     *     *
4278,THE POET AS LOVER,"Yet, ere he went, he strove once more to trace"
4279,THE POET AS LOVER,"Deep in her eyes, the loveliness he knew,"
4280,THE POET AS LOVER,Then--spat his hatred in her smiling face.
4281,THE POET AS LOVER,
4282,THE POET AS LOVER,"It is probably an instance of the poet's blindness to the sensual, that"
4283,THE POET AS LOVER,he is often represented as having a peculiar sympathy with the fallen
4284,THE POET AS LOVER,woman. He feels that all beauty in this world is forced to enter into
4285,THE POET AS LOVER,"forms unworthy of it, and he finds the attractiveness of the courtesan"
4286,THE POET AS LOVER,only an extreme instance of this. Joaquin Miller's _The Ideal and the
4287,THE POET AS LOVER,"Real_ is an allegory in which the poet, following ideal beauty into"
4288,THE POET AS LOVER,"this world, finds her in such a form. The tradition of the poet"
4289,THE POET AS LOVER,"idealizing the outcast, which dates back at least to Rossetti's"
4290,THE POET AS LOVER,"_Jenny_, is still alive, as witness John D. Neihardt's recent poem,"
4291,THE POET AS LOVER,"_A Vision of Woman_. [Footnote: See also Kirke White, _The Prostitute_;"
4292,THE POET AS LOVER,"Whitman, _To a Common Prostitute_; Joaquin Miller, _A Dove of St. Mark_;"
4293,THE POET AS LOVER,"and Olive Dargan, _A Magdalen to Her Poet_.]"
4294,THE POET AS LOVER,
4295,THE POET AS LOVER,"To return to the question of the poet's fickleness, a very ingenious"
4296,THE POET AS LOVER,"denial of it is found in the argument that, as his poetical love is"
4297,THE POET AS LOVER,"purely ideal, he can indulge in a natural love that in no way interferes"
4298,THE POET AS LOVER,with it. A favorite view of the 1890's is in Ernest Dowson's _Non Sum
4299,THE POET AS LOVER,Qualis Eram Bonæ sub Regno Cynaræ_:
4300,THE POET AS LOVER,
4301,THE POET AS LOVER,"Last night, ah, yesternight, betwixt her lips and mine"
4302,THE POET AS LOVER,"There fell thy shadow, Cynara! thy breath was shed"
4303,THE POET AS LOVER,Upon my soul between the kisses and the wine;
4304,THE POET AS LOVER,And I was desolate and sick of an old passion;
4305,THE POET AS LOVER,"Yea, I was desolate and bowed my head:"
4306,THE POET AS LOVER,"I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion."
4307,THE POET AS LOVER,
4308,THE POET AS LOVER,The poet sometimes regards it as a proof of the supersensual nature of
4309,THE POET AS LOVER,"his passion that he is, willing to marry another woman. The hero of May"
4310,THE POET AS LOVER,"Sinclair's novel, _The Divine Fire_, who is irresistibly impelled"
4311,THE POET AS LOVER,"to propose to a girl, even while he trembles at the sacrilege of her"
4312,THE POET AS LOVER,"touching a book belonging to his soul's mistress, is only a _reductio"
4313,THE POET AS LOVER,ad absurdum_ of a rather popular theory. All narratives of this sort
4314,THE POET AS LOVER,"can probably be traced back to Dante's autobiography, as given in the"
4315,THE POET AS LOVER,"_Vita Nuova_. We have two poetic dramas dealing with Dante's love,"
4316,THE POET AS LOVER,"by G. L. Raymond, [Footnote: _Dante_] and by Sara King Wiley."
4317,THE POET AS LOVER,"[Footnote: _Dante and Beatrice_] Both these writers, however, show"
4318,THE POET AS LOVER,a tendency to slur over Dante's affection for Gemma. Raymond represents
4319,THE POET AS LOVER,their marriage as the result solely of Dante's compromising her by
4320,THE POET AS LOVER,"apparent attention, in order to avoid the appearance of insulting"
4321,THE POET AS LOVER,"Beatrice with too close regard. Sara King Wiley, on the other hand,"
4322,THE POET AS LOVER,"stresses the other aspect of Dante's feeling for Gemma, his gratitude"
4323,THE POET AS LOVER,for her pity at the time of Beatrice's death. Of course both dramatists
4324,THE POET AS LOVER,are bound by historical considerations to make the outcome of their
4325,THE POET AS LOVER,"plays tragical, but practically all other expositions of the poet's"
4326,THE POET AS LOVER,double affections are likewise tragic. Cale Young Rice chooses another
4327,THE POET AS LOVER,"famous Renaissance lover for the hero of _A Night in Avignon_, a"
4328,THE POET AS LOVER,"play with this theme. Here Petrarch, in a fit of impatience with his"
4329,THE POET AS LOVER,"long loyalty to a hopeless love for Laura, turns to a light woman for"
4330,THE POET AS LOVER,"consolation. According to the accepted mode, he refuses to tolerate"
4331,THE POET AS LOVER,"Laura's name on the lips of his fancy. Laura, who has chosen this"
4332,THE POET AS LOVER,inconvenient moment to become convinced of the purity of Petrarch's
4333,THE POET AS LOVER,"devotion to her, comes to his home to offer her heart, but, discovering"
4334,THE POET AS LOVER,"the other woman's presence there, she fails utterly to comprehend the"
4335,THE POET AS LOVER,"subtle compliment to her involved, and leaves Petrarch in an agony of"
4336,THE POET AS LOVER,contrition.
4337,THE POET AS LOVER,
4338,THE POET AS LOVER,"Marlowe, in Josephine Preston Peabody's drama, distributes his"
4339,THE POET AS LOVER,admiration more equally between his two loves. One stimulates the
4340,THE POET AS LOVER,"dramatist in him, by giving him an insatiable thirst for this world; the"
4341,THE POET AS LOVER,"other elevates the poet, by lifting his thoughts to eternal beauty. When"
4342,THE POET AS LOVER,he is charged with being in love with the Canterbury maiden who is the
4343,THE POET AS LOVER,"object of his reverence, the ""Little Quietude,"" as he calls her, he,"
4344,THE POET AS LOVER,"comparing her to the Evening Star, contrasts her with the object of his"
4345,THE POET AS LOVER,"burning passion, who seems to him the fruit of the tree of knowledge of"
4346,THE POET AS LOVER,"good and evil. He explains,"
4347,THE POET AS LOVER,
4348,THE POET AS LOVER,"I serve a lady so imperial fair,"
4349,THE POET AS LOVER,"June paled when she was born. Indeed no star,"
4350,THE POET AS LOVER,"No dream, no distance, but a very woman,"
4351,THE POET AS LOVER,Wise with the argent wisdom of the snake;
4352,THE POET AS LOVER,Fair nurtured with that old forbidden fruit
4353,THE POET AS LOVER,That thou hast heard of ...
4354,THE POET AS LOVER,"... I would eat, and have all human joy,"
4355,THE POET AS LOVER,"And know,--and know."
4356,THE POET AS LOVER,
4357,THE POET AS LOVER,"He continues,"
4358,THE POET AS LOVER,
4359,THE POET AS LOVER,"But, for the Evening Star, I have it there."
4360,THE POET AS LOVER,I would not have it nearer. Is that love
4361,THE POET AS LOVER,As thou dost understand? Yet is it mine
4362,THE POET AS LOVER,"As I would have it: to look down on me,"
4363,THE POET AS LOVER,"Not loving and not cruel; to be bright,"
4364,THE POET AS LOVER,Out of my reach; to lighten me the dark
4365,THE POET AS LOVER,"When I lift eyes to it, and in the day"
4366,THE POET AS LOVER,"To be forgotten. But of all things, far,"
4367,THE POET AS LOVER,"Far off beyond me, otherwise no star."
4368,THE POET AS LOVER,
4369,THE POET AS LOVER,"Marlowe's closing words bring us to another important question, _i. e._,"
4370,THE POET AS LOVER,the stage of love at which it is most inspiring. This is the subject of
4371,THE POET AS LOVER,"much difference of opinion. Mrs. Browning might well inquire, in one of"
4372,THE POET AS LOVER,"her love sonnets,"
4373,THE POET AS LOVER,
4374,THE POET AS LOVER,"How, Dearest, wilt thou have me for most use?"
4375,THE POET AS LOVER,"A hope, to sing by gladly? or a fine"
4376,THE POET AS LOVER,Sad memory with thy songs to interfuse?
4377,THE POET AS LOVER,"A shade, in which to sing, of palm or pine?"
4378,THE POET AS LOVER,"A grave, on which to rest from singing? Choose."
4379,THE POET AS LOVER,"[Footnote: _Sonnets from the Portuguese_, XVII.]"
4380,THE POET AS LOVER,Each of these situations has been celebrated as begetting the poet's
4381,THE POET AS LOVER,inspiration.
4382,THE POET AS LOVER,
4383,THE POET AS LOVER,"To follow the process of elimination, we may first dispose of the"
4384,THE POET AS LOVER,married state as least likely to be spiritually creative. It is true
4385,THE POET AS LOVER,that we find a number of poems addressed by poets to their wives. But
4386,THE POET AS LOVER,these are more likely to be the contented purring of one who writes by a
4387,THE POET AS LOVER,"cozy fireside, than the passionate cadence of one whose genius has been"
4388,THE POET AS LOVER,fanned to flame. One finds but a single champion of the married state
4389,THE POET AS LOVER,"considered abstractly. This is Alfred Austin, in whose poem, _The Poet"
4390,THE POET AS LOVER,"and the Muse_, his genius explains to the newly betrothed poet:"
4391,THE POET AS LOVER,
4392,THE POET AS LOVER,"How should you, poet, hope to sing?"
4393,THE POET AS LOVER,The lute of love hath a single string.
4394,THE POET AS LOVER,"Its note is sweet as the coo of the dove,"
4395,THE POET AS LOVER,"But 'tis only one note, and the note is love."
4396,THE POET AS LOVER,
4397,THE POET AS LOVER,"But when once you have paired and built your nest,"
4398,THE POET AS LOVER,"And can brood thereon with a settled breast,"
4399,THE POET AS LOVER,"You will sing once more, and your voice will stir"
4400,THE POET AS LOVER,All hearts with the sweetness gained from her.
4401,THE POET AS LOVER,
4402,THE POET AS LOVER,And perhaps even Alfred Austin's vote is canceled by his inconsistent
4403,THE POET AS LOVER,"statement in his poem on Petrarch, _At Vaucluse_,"
4404,THE POET AS LOVER,
4405,THE POET AS LOVER,"Let this to lowlier bards atone,"
4406,THE POET AS LOVER,"Whose unknown Laura is their own,"
4407,THE POET AS LOVER,Possessing and possessed:
4408,THE POET AS LOVER,
4409,THE POET AS LOVER,"Of whom if sooth they do not sing,"
4410,THE POET AS LOVER,'Tis that near her they fold their wing
4411,THE POET AS LOVER,To drop into her nest.
4412,THE POET AS LOVER,
4413,THE POET AS LOVER,Let us not forget Shelley's expression of his need for his wife:
4414,THE POET AS LOVER,
4415,THE POET AS LOVER,"Ah, Mary dear, come to me soon;"
4416,THE POET AS LOVER,I am not well when thou art far;
4417,THE POET AS LOVER,"As twilight to the sphered moon,"
4418,THE POET AS LOVER,"As sunset to the evening star,"
4419,THE POET AS LOVER,"Thou, beloved, art to me."
4420,THE POET AS LOVER,[Footnote: _To Mary_.]
4421,THE POET AS LOVER,
4422,THE POET AS LOVER,Perhaps it is unworthy quibbling to object that the figure here suggests
4423,THE POET AS LOVER,too strongly Shelley's consciousness of the merely atmospheric function
4424,THE POET AS LOVER,"of Mary, in enhancing his own personality, as contrasted with the"
4425,THE POET AS LOVER,"radiant divinity of Emilia Viviani, to whom he ascribes his"
4426,THE POET AS LOVER,"creativeness. [Footnote: Compare Wordsworth, _She Was a Phantom of"
4427,THE POET AS LOVER,"Delight_, _Dearer Far than Life_; Tennyson, _Dedication of"
4428,THE POET AS LOVER,Enoch Arden_.]
4429,THE POET AS LOVER,
4430,THE POET AS LOVER,It is customary for our bards gallantly to explain that the completeness
4431,THE POET AS LOVER,of their domestic happiness leaves them no lurking discontent to spur
4432,THE POET AS LOVER,them onto verse writing. This is the conclusion of the happily wedded
4433,THE POET AS LOVER,"heroes of Bayard Taylor's _A Poet's Journal_, and of Coventry"
4434,THE POET AS LOVER,Patmore's _The Angel in the House_; likewise of the poet in J. G.
4435,THE POET AS LOVER,"Holland's _Kathrina_, who excuses his waning inspiration after his"

4437,THE POET AS LOVER,
4438,THE POET AS LOVER,"She, being all my world, had left no room"
4439,THE POET AS LOVER,For other occupation than my love.
4440,THE POET AS LOVER,... I had grown enervate
4441,THE POET AS LOVER,In the warm atmosphere which I had breathed.
4442,THE POET AS LOVER,
4443,THE POET AS LOVER,"Taken as a whole, the evidence is decidedly in favor of the remote love,"
4444,THE POET AS LOVER,prevented in some way from reaching its culmination. To requote Alfred
4445,THE POET AS LOVER,"Noyes, the poet knows that ideal love must be"
4446,THE POET AS LOVER,
4447,THE POET AS LOVER,"Far off, beyond me, otherwise no star."
4448,THE POET AS LOVER,[Footnote: Marlowe.]
4449,THE POET AS LOVER,
4450,THE POET AS LOVER,In _Sister Songs_ Francis Thompson asserts that such remoteness is
4451,THE POET AS LOVER,essential to his genius:
4452,THE POET AS LOVER,
4453,THE POET AS LOVER,I deem well why life unshared

4482,THE POET AS LOVER,
4483,THE POET AS LOVER,The manner of achieving this necessary remoteness is a nice problem. Of
4484,THE POET AS LOVER,"course the poet may choose it, with open eyes, as the Marlowe of Miss"
4485,THE POET AS LOVER,"Peabody's imagination does, or as the minstrel in Hewlitt's _Cormac,"
4486,THE POET AS LOVER,Son of Ogmond_. The long engagements of Rossetti and Tennyson are
4487,THE POET AS LOVER,often quoted as exemplifying this idiosyncrasy of poets. But there is
4488,THE POET AS LOVER,"something decidedly awkward in such a situation, inasmuch as it is not"
4489,THE POET AS LOVER,till love becomes so intense as to eclipse the poet's pride and joy in
4490,THE POET AS LOVER,poetry that it becomes effective as a muse. [Footnote: See Mrs.
4491,THE POET AS LOVER,"Browning, Sonnet VII."

4496,THE POET AS LOVER,
4497,THE POET AS LOVER,"The minor poet, to be sure, is often discovered solicitously feeling his"
4498,THE POET AS LOVER,"pulse to gauge the effect of love on his rhymes, but one does not feel"
4499,THE POET AS LOVER,"that his verse gains by it. Therefore, an external obstacle is usually"
4500,THE POET AS LOVER,made to intervene.
4501,THE POET AS LOVER,
4502,THE POET AS LOVER,"As often as not, this obstacle is the indifference of the beloved. One"
4503,THE POET AS LOVER,"finds rejected poets by the dozens, mourning in the verse of our period."
4504,THE POET AS LOVER,The sweetheart's reasons are manifold; her suitor's inferior station and
4505,THE POET AS LOVER,poverty being favorites. But one wonders if the primary reason may not
4506,THE POET AS LOVER,"be the quality of the love offered by the poet, whose extreme humility"
4507,THE POET AS LOVER,"and idealization are likely to engender pride and contempt in the lady,"
4508,THE POET AS LOVER,she being unaware that it is the reflection of his own soul that the
4509,THE POET AS LOVER,poet is worshipping in her. One can feel some sympathy with the lady in
4510,THE POET AS LOVER,"Thomas Hardy's _I Rose Up as My Custom Is_, who, when her lover's"
4511,THE POET AS LOVER,"ghost discovers her beside a snoring spouse, confesses that she is"
4512,THE POET AS LOVER,content with her lot:
4513,THE POET AS LOVER,
4514,THE POET AS LOVER,"He makes no quest into my thoughts,"
4515,THE POET AS LOVER,But a poet wants to know
4516,THE POET AS LOVER,"What one has felt from earliest days,"
4517,THE POET AS LOVER,"Why one thought not in other ways,"
4518,THE POET AS LOVER,And one's loves of long ago.
4519,THE POET AS LOVER,
4520,THE POET AS LOVER,"It may be, too, that an instinct for protection has something to do with"
4521,THE POET AS LOVER,"the lady's rejection, for a recent poet has openly proclaimed the effect"
4522,THE POET AS LOVER,"of attaining, in successful love, one step toward absolute beauty:"
4523,THE POET AS LOVER,
4524,THE POET AS LOVER,"O beauty, as thy heart o'erflows"
4525,THE POET AS LOVER,"In tender yielding unto me,"

4529,THE POET AS LOVER,
4530,THE POET AS LOVER,"Rejection is apt to prove an obstacle of double worth to the poet, since"
4531,THE POET AS LOVER,it not only removes him to a distance where his lady's human frailties
4532,THE POET AS LOVER,"are less visible, so that the divine light shining through her seems"
4533,THE POET AS LOVER,"less impeded, but it also fires him with a very human ambition to prove"
4534,THE POET AS LOVER,"his transcendent worth and thus ""get even"" with his unappreciative"
4535,THE POET AS LOVER,"beloved. [Footnote: See Joaquin Miller, _Ina_; G. L. Raymond,"

4537,THE POET AS LOVER,
4538,THE POET AS LOVER,Richard Realf in _Advice Gratis_ satirically depicts the lady's

4540,THE POET AS LOVER,
4541,THE POET AS LOVER,It would strike fresh heat in your poet's verse

4543,THE POET AS LOVER,They write supremely under a curse.]
4544,THE POET AS LOVER,
4545,THE POET AS LOVER,"There is danger, of course, that the disillusionment produced by the"
4546,THE POET AS LOVER,revelation of low ideals which the lady makes in her refusal will
4547,THE POET AS LOVER,"counterbalance these good effects. Still, though the poet is so"
4548,THE POET AS LOVER,"egotistical toward all the world beside, in his attitude toward his lady"
4549,THE POET AS LOVER,the humility which Emerson expresses in _The Sphinx_ is not without
4550,THE POET AS LOVER,parallel in verse. Many singers follow him in his belief that the only
4551,THE POET AS LOVER,worthy love is that for a being so superior that a return of love is
4552,THE POET AS LOVER,impossible. [Footnote: See _The Sphinx_--
4553,THE POET AS LOVER,
4554,THE POET AS LOVER,Have I a lover who is noble and free?
4555,THE POET AS LOVER,I would he were nobler than to love me.

4561,THE POET AS LOVER,
4562,THE POET AS LOVER,To poets who do not subscribe to Emerson's belief in one-sided
4563,THE POET AS LOVER,"attachments, Alexander Smith's _A Life Drama_ is a treasury of"
4564,THE POET AS LOVER,suggestions as to devices by which the poet's lady may be kept at
4565,THE POET AS LOVER,sufficient distance to be useful. With the aid of intercalations Smith
4566,THE POET AS LOVER,"exhibits the poet removed from his lady by scornful rejection, by"
4567,THE POET AS LOVER,"parental restraint, by an unhappy marriage, by self-reproach, and by"
4568,THE POET AS LOVER,death. All these devices have been popular in our poetry.
4569,THE POET AS LOVER,
4570,THE POET AS LOVER,"The lady's marriage is seldom felt to be an insuperable barrier to love,"
4571,THE POET AS LOVER,though it is effective in removing her to a suitable distance for
4572,THE POET AS LOVER,idealization. The poet's worship is so supersensual as to be
4573,THE POET AS LOVER,inoffensive. To confine ourselves to poetic dramas treating historical
4574,THE POET AS LOVER,"poets,--Beatrice,[Footnote: G. L. Raymond's and S. K. Wiley's dramas,"
4575,THE POET AS LOVER,"_Dante_, and _Dante and Beatrice_.] Laura, [Footnote: Cale Young Rice,"
4576,THE POET AS LOVER,"_A Night in Avignon_.] Vittoria Colonna, [Footnote: Longfellow, _Michael"
4577,THE POET AS LOVER,"Angelo_.] and Alison [Footnote: Peabody, _Marlowe_.] are all married to"
4578,THE POET AS LOVER,one man while inspiring another. A characteristic autobiographical love
4579,THE POET AS LOVER,"poem of this type, is that of Francis Thompson, who asserts the ideality"
4580,THE POET AS LOVER,of the poet's affection in his reference to
4581,THE POET AS LOVER,
4582,THE POET AS LOVER,"This soul which on thy soul is laid,"
4583,THE POET AS LOVER,As maid's breast upon breast of maid.
4584,THE POET AS LOVER,"[Footnote: See also _Ad Amicam_, _Her Portrait_, _Manus Animon Pinxit_.]"
4585,THE POET AS LOVER,
4586,THE POET AS LOVER,There is no other barrier that so elevates love as does death.
4587,THE POET AS LOVER,Translation of love into Platonic idealism is then almost inevitable.
4588,THE POET AS LOVER,Alexander Smith describes the change accomplished by the death of the
4589,THE POET AS LOVER,poet's sweetheart:
4590,THE POET AS LOVER,
4591,THE POET AS LOVER,"Two passions dwelt at once within his soul,"
4592,THE POET AS LOVER,Like eve and sunset dwelling in one sky.
4593,THE POET AS LOVER,"And as the sunset dies along the west,"
4594,THE POET AS LOVER,Eve higher lifts her front of trembling stars
4595,THE POET AS LOVER,"Till she is seated in the middle sky,"
4596,THE POET AS LOVER,So gradual one passion slowly died
4597,THE POET AS LOVER,"And from its death the other drew fresh life,"
4598,THE POET AS LOVER,"Until 'twas seated in the soul alone,"
4599,THE POET AS LOVER,"The dead was love, the living, poetry."
4600,THE POET AS LOVER,
4601,THE POET AS LOVER,"The mystic merging of Beatrice into ideal beauty is, of course,"
4602,THE POET AS LOVER,"mentioned often in nineteenth century poetry, most sympathetically,"
4603,THE POET AS LOVER,"perhaps, by Rossetti. [Footnote: See _On the Vita Nuova of Dante_;"
4604,THE POET AS LOVER,also _Dante at Verona_.] Much the same kind of translation is
4605,THE POET AS LOVER,"described in _Vane's Story_, by James Thomson, B.V., which appears"
4606,THE POET AS LOVER,to be a sort of mystic autobiography.
4607,THE POET AS LOVER,
4608,THE POET AS LOVER,"The ascent in love for beauty, as Plato describes it, [Footnote:"
4609,THE POET AS LOVER,_Symposium._] might be expected to mark at every step an increase
4610,THE POET AS LOVER,"of poetic power, as it leads one from the individual beauties of sense"
4611,THE POET AS LOVER,"to absolute, supersensual beauty. But it is extremely doubtful if this"
4612,THE POET AS LOVER,increase in poetic power is achieved when our poets try to take the last
4613,THE POET AS LOVER,"step, and rely for their inspiration upon a lover's passion for"
4614,THE POET AS LOVER,"disembodied, purely ideal beauty. The lyric power of such love has,"
4615,THE POET AS LOVER,"indeed, been celebrated by a recent poet. George Edward Woodberry, in"
4616,THE POET AS LOVER,"his sonnet sequence, _Ideal Passion_, thus exalts his mistress, the"
4617,THE POET AS LOVER,"abstract idea of beauty, above the loves of other poets:"
4618,THE POET AS LOVER,
4619,THE POET AS LOVER,Dante and Petrarch all unenvied go
4620,THE POET AS LOVER,"From star to star, upward, all heavens above,"
4621,THE POET AS LOVER,"The grave forgot, forgot the human woe."
4622,THE POET AS LOVER,"Though glorified, their love was human love,"
4623,THE POET AS LOVER,One unto one; a greater love I know.
4624,THE POET AS LOVER,
4625,THE POET AS LOVER,But very few of our poets have felt their genius burning at its
4626,THE POET AS LOVER,brightest when they have eschewed the sensuous embodiment of their love.
4627,THE POET AS LOVER,
4628,THE POET AS LOVER,Plato might point out that he intended his theory of progression in love
4629,THE POET AS LOVER,"as a description of the development of the philosopher, not of the poet,"
4630,THE POET AS LOVER,"who, as a base imitator of sense, has not a pure enough soul to soar"
4631,THE POET AS LOVER,very high away from it. But our writers have been able partially to
4632,THE POET AS LOVER,vindicate poets by pointing out that Dante was able to travel the whole
4633,THE POET AS LOVER,"way toward absolute beauty, and to sublimate his perceptions to"
4634,THE POET AS LOVER,supersensual fineness without losing their poetic tone. Nineteenth and
4635,THE POET AS LOVER,twentieth century writers may modestly assert that it is the fault of
4636,THE POET AS LOVER,"their inadequacy to represent poetry, and not a fault in the poetic"
4637,THE POET AS LOVER,"character as such, that accounts for the tameness of their most"
4638,THE POET AS LOVER,idealistic verse.
4639,THE POET AS LOVER,
4640,THE POET AS LOVER,"However this may be, one notes a tendency in much purely idealistic and"
4641,THE POET AS LOVER,philosophical love poetry to present us with a mere skeleton of
4642,THE POET AS LOVER,"abstraction. Part of this effect may be the reader's fault, of course."
4643,THE POET AS LOVER,Plato assures us that the harmonies of mathematics are more ravishing
4644,THE POET AS LOVER,"than the harmonies of music to the pure spirit, but many of us must take"
4645,THE POET AS LOVER,his word for it; in the same way it may be that when we fail to
4646,THE POET AS LOVER,appreciate certain celebrations of ideal love it is because of our
4647,THE POET AS LOVER,"""muddy vesture of decay"" which hinders our hearing its harmonies."
4648,THE POET AS LOVER,
4649,THE POET AS LOVER,"Within the last one hundred and fifty years three notable attempts, of"
4650,THE POET AS LOVER,"widely varying success, have been made to write a purely philosophical"
4651,THE POET AS LOVER,"love poem.[Footnote: Keats' _Endymion_ is not discussed here, though it"
4652,THE POET AS LOVER,seems to have much in common with the philosophy of the _Symposium_. See
4653,THE POET AS LOVER,"Sidney Colvin, _John Keats_, pp. 160ff.]"
4654,THE POET AS LOVER,
4655,THE POET AS LOVER,"Bulwer Lytton's _Milton_ was, if one may believe the press notices,"
4656,THE POET AS LOVER,"the most favorably received of his poems, but it is a signal example of"
4657,THE POET AS LOVER,"aspiring verse that misses both the sensuous beauty of poetry, and the"
4658,THE POET AS LOVER,intellectual content of philosophy. Milton is portrayed as the life-long
4659,THE POET AS LOVER,lover of an incarnation of beauty too attenuated to be human and too
4660,THE POET AS LOVER,physical to be purely ideal. At first Milton devotes himself to this
4661,THE POET AS LOVER,"vision exclusively, but, hearing the call of his country in distress, he"
4662,THE POET AS LOVER,"abandons her, and their love is not suffered to culminate till after"
4663,THE POET AS LOVER,death. Bulwer Lytton cites the _Phædrus_ of Plato as the basis of
4664,THE POET AS LOVER,"his allegory, reminding us,"
4665,THE POET AS LOVER,
4666,THE POET AS LOVER,The Athenian guessed that when our souls descend
4667,THE POET AS LOVER,"From some lost realm (sad aliens here to be),"
4668,THE POET AS LOVER,"Dim broken memories of the state before,"
4669,THE POET AS LOVER,Form what we call our reason...
4670,THE POET AS LOVER,"... Is not Love,"
4671,THE POET AS LOVER,Of all those memories which to parent skies
4672,THE POET AS LOVER,"Mount struggling back--(as to their source, above,"
4673,THE POET AS LOVER,"In upward showers, imprisoned founts arise:)"
4674,THE POET AS LOVER,"Oh, is not Love the strongest and the clearest?"
4675,THE POET AS LOVER,
4676,THE POET AS LOVER,Greater importance attaches to a recent treatment of the theme by George
4677,THE POET AS LOVER,"Edward Woodberry. His poem, _Agathon_, dealing with the young poet of"
4678,THE POET AS LOVER,"Plato's _Symposium_, is our most literal interpretation of Platonism."
4679,THE POET AS LOVER,"Agathon is sought out by the god of love, Eros, who is able to realize"
4680,THE POET AS LOVER,his divinity only through the perfection of man's love of beauty. He
4681,THE POET AS LOVER,"chooses Agathon as the object of instruction because Agathon is a poet,"
4682,THE POET AS LOVER,one of those
4683,THE POET AS LOVER,
4684,THE POET AS LOVER,Whose eyes were more divinely touched
4685,THE POET AS LOVER,In that long-memoried world whence souls set forth.
4686,THE POET AS LOVER,
4687,THE POET AS LOVER,"As the poem opens, Agathon is in the state of the favorite poet of"
4688,THE POET AS LOVER,"nineteenth century imagination, loving, yet discontented with, the"
4689,THE POET AS LOVER,"beauty of the senses. To Diotima, the wise woman of the _Symposium_,"
4690,THE POET AS LOVER,he expresses his unhappiness:
4691,THE POET AS LOVER,
4692,THE POET AS LOVER,Still must I mourn
4693,THE POET AS LOVER,That every lovely thing escapes the heart
4694,THE POET AS LOVER,Even in the moment of its cherishing.
4695,THE POET AS LOVER,
4696,THE POET AS LOVER,"Eros appears and promises Agathon that if he will accept his love, he"
4697,THE POET AS LOVER,"may find happiness in eternal beauty, and his poetical gift will be"
4698,THE POET AS LOVER,ennobled:
4699,THE POET AS LOVER,
4700,THE POET AS LOVER,"Eros I am, the wooer of men's hearts."
4701,THE POET AS LOVER,Unclasp thy lips; yield me thy close embrace;
4702,THE POET AS LOVER,"So shall thy thoughts once more to heaven climb,"
4703,THE POET AS LOVER,"Their music linger here, the joy of men."
4704,THE POET AS LOVER,
4705,THE POET AS LOVER,"Agathon resolves to cleave to him, but at this point Anteros,"
4706,THE POET AS LOVER,"corresponding to Plato's Venus Pandemos, enters into rivalry with Eros"
4707,THE POET AS LOVER,"for Agathon's love. He shows the poet a beautiful phantom, who describes"
4708,THE POET AS LOVER,the folly of one who devotes himself to spiritual love:
4709,THE POET AS LOVER,
4710,THE POET AS LOVER,"The waste desire be his, and sightless fate,"
4711,THE POET AS LOVER,Him light shall not revisit; late he knows
4712,THE POET AS LOVER,The love that mates the heaven weds the grave.
4713,THE POET AS LOVER,
4714,THE POET AS LOVER,"Agathon starts to embrace her, but seeing in her face the inevitable"
4715,THE POET AS LOVER,"decay of sensual beauty, he recoils, crying,"
4716,THE POET AS LOVER,
4717,THE POET AS LOVER,In its fiery womb I saw
4718,THE POET AS LOVER,"The twisted serpent ringing woe obscene,"
4719,THE POET AS LOVER,And far it lit the pitchy ways of hell.
4720,THE POET AS LOVER,
4721,THE POET AS LOVER,"In an agony of horror and contrition, he recalls Eros, who expounds to"
4722,THE POET AS LOVER,"him how love, beginning with sensuous beauty, leads one to ideality:"
4723,THE POET AS LOVER,
4724,THE POET AS LOVER,Let not dejection on thy heart take hold
4725,THE POET AS LOVER,"That nature hath in thee her sure effects,"
4726,THE POET AS LOVER,"And beauty wakes desire. Should Daphne's eyes,"
4727,THE POET AS LOVER,"Leucothea's arms, and clinging white caress,"
4728,THE POET AS LOVER,"The arch of Thetis' brows, be made in vain?"
4729,THE POET AS LOVER,
4730,THE POET AS LOVER,"But, he continues,"
4731,THE POET AS LOVER,
4732,THE POET AS LOVER,In fair things
4733,THE POET AS LOVER,"There is another vigor, flowing forth"
4734,THE POET AS LOVER,"From heavenly fountains, the glad energy"
4735,THE POET AS LOVER,"That broke on chaos, and the outward rush"
4736,THE POET AS LOVER,Of the eternal mind;...
4737,THE POET AS LOVER,... Hence the poet's eye
4738,THE POET AS LOVER,"That mortal sees, creates immortally"
4739,THE POET AS LOVER,"The hero more than men, not more than man,"
4740,THE POET AS LOVER,The type prophetic.
4741,THE POET AS LOVER,
4742,THE POET AS LOVER,"Agathon, in an ecstasy of comprehension, chants the praises of love"
4743,THE POET AS LOVER,"which Plato puts into his mouth in the _Symposium_. In conclusion,"
4744,THE POET AS LOVER,Urania sums up the mystery of love and genius:
4745,THE POET AS LOVER,
4746,THE POET AS LOVER,"For truth divine is life, not love,"
4747,THE POET AS LOVER,"Creative truth, and evermore"
4748,THE POET AS LOVER,Fashions the object of desire
4749,THE POET AS LOVER,Through love that breathes the spirit's fire.
4750,THE POET AS LOVER,
4751,THE POET AS LOVER,We may fittingly conclude a discussion of the poet as lover with
4752,THE POET AS LOVER,"the _Epipsychidion_, not merely because it is the most idealistic of"
4753,THE POET AS LOVER,"the interpretations of Platonic love given by nineteenth century poets,"
4754,THE POET AS LOVER,but because by virtue of the fact that it describes Shelley's personal
4755,THE POET AS LOVER,"experience, it should be most valuable in revealing the attitude toward"
4756,THE POET AS LOVER,love of one possessing the purest of poetic gifts. [Footnote: Treatment
4757,THE POET AS LOVER,of this theme is foreshadowed in _Alastor_.]
4758,THE POET AS LOVER,
4759,THE POET AS LOVER,The prominence given to Shelley's earthly loves in this poem has led J.
4760,THE POET AS LOVER,"A. Symonds to deny that it is truly Platonic. He remarks,"
4761,THE POET AS LOVER,
4762,THE POET AS LOVER,"While Shelley's doctrine in _Epipsychidion_ seems Platonic, it will"
4763,THE POET AS LOVER,not square with the _Symposium_.... When a man has formed a just
4764,THE POET AS LOVER,"conception of universal beauty, he looks back with a smile on those who"
4765,THE POET AS LOVER,find their soul's sphere in the love of some mere mortal object. Tested
4766,THE POET AS LOVER,"by this standard, Shelley's identification of Intellectual Beauty with"
4767,THE POET AS LOVER,"so many daughters of earth, and his worshipping love of Emilia, is"
4768,THE POET AS LOVER,"spurious Platonism.[Footnote: _Shelley_, p. 142.]"
4769,THE POET AS LOVER,
4770,THE POET AS LOVER,Perhaps this failure to break altogether with the physical is precisely
4771,THE POET AS LOVER,the distinction between the love of the poet and the love of the
4772,THE POET AS LOVER,philosopher with whom Plato is concerned. I do not believe that the
4773,THE POET AS LOVER,Platonism of this poem is intrinsically spurious; the conception of
4774,THE POET AS LOVER,Emilia seems to be intended simply as a poetic personification of
4775,THE POET AS LOVER,"abstract beauty, but it is undeniable that at times this vision does not"
4776,THE POET AS LOVER,"mean abstract beauty to Shelley at all, but the actual Emilia Viviani."
4777,THE POET AS LOVER,"He has protested against this judgment, ""The _Epipsychidion_ is a"
4778,THE POET AS LOVER,"mystery; as to real flesh and blood, you know that I do not deal with"
4779,THE POET AS LOVER,"those articles."" The revulsion of feeling that turned him away from"
4780,THE POET AS LOVER,"Emilia, however, taught him how much of his feeling for her had entered"
4781,THE POET AS LOVER,"into the poem, so that, in June, 1822, Shelley wrote,"
4782,THE POET AS LOVER,
4783,THE POET AS LOVER,The _Epipsychidion_ I cannot bear to look at. I think
4784,THE POET AS LOVER,one is always in love with something or other; the
4785,THE POET AS LOVER,"error, and I confess it is not easy for spirits cased in"
4786,THE POET AS LOVER,"flesh and blood to avoid it, consists in seeking in a"
4787,THE POET AS LOVER,mortal image the likeness of what is perhaps eternal.
4788,THE POET AS LOVER,
4789,THE POET AS LOVER,Shelley begins his spiritual autobiography with his early mystical
4790,THE POET AS LOVER,"intuition of the existence of spiritual beauty, which is to be the real"
4791,THE POET AS LOVER,"object of his love throughout life. By Plato, of course, this love is"
4792,THE POET AS LOVER,"made prenatal. Shelley says,"
4793,THE POET AS LOVER,
4794,THE POET AS LOVER,"She met me, robed in such exceeding glory"
4795,THE POET AS LOVER,That I beheld her not.
4796,THE POET AS LOVER,
4797,THE POET AS LOVER,"As this vision was totally disjoined from earthly objects, it won the"
4798,THE POET AS LOVER,"soul away from all interest in life. Therefore Shelley says,"
4799,THE POET AS LOVER,
4800,THE POET AS LOVER,"She met me, Stranger, upon life's rough way"
4801,THE POET AS LOVER,And lured me towards sweet death.
4802,THE POET AS LOVER,
4803,THE POET AS LOVER,"This early vision passed away, however,"
4804,THE POET AS LOVER,
4805,THE POET AS LOVER,Into the dreary cone of our life's shade.
4806,THE POET AS LOVER,
4807,THE POET AS LOVER,This line is evidently Shelley's Platonic fashion of referring to the
4808,THE POET AS LOVER,obscurity of this life as compared to the world of ideas. As the vision
4809,THE POET AS LOVER,"has embodied itself in this world, it is only through love of its"
4810,THE POET AS LOVER,concrete manifestations that the soul may regain it. When it is
4811,THE POET AS LOVER,"regained, it will not be, as in the beginning, a momentary intuition,"
4812,THE POET AS LOVER,but an abiding presence in the soul.
4813,THE POET AS LOVER,
4814,THE POET AS LOVER,The first step toward this goal was a mistaken one. Shelley describes
4815,THE POET AS LOVER,"his marriage with Harriet as a yielding to the senses merely, in other"
4816,THE POET AS LOVER,"words, as slavery to the Venus Pandemos. He describes this false vision,"
4817,THE POET AS LOVER,
4818,THE POET AS LOVER,Whose voice was venomed melody.
4819,THE POET AS LOVER,*        *        *        *        *
4820,THE POET AS LOVER,"The breath of her false mouth was like sweet flowers,"
4821,THE POET AS LOVER,Her touch was as electric poison.
4822,THE POET AS LOVER,
4823,THE POET AS LOVER,"Shelley was more successful in his second love, for Mary, whom he calls"
4824,THE POET AS LOVER,"the ""cold, chaste moon."" The danger of this stage in the ascent toward"
4825,THE POET AS LOVER,beauty is that one is likely to be content with the fragmentary glimpse
4826,THE POET AS LOVER,"of beauty gained through the loved one, and by losing sight of its other"
4827,THE POET AS LOVER,embodiments fail to aspire to more complete vision. So Shelley says of
4828,THE POET AS LOVER,"this period, ""I was laid asleep, spirit and limb."" By a great effort,"
4829,THE POET AS LOVER,"however, the next step was taken,--the agonizing one of breaking away"
4830,THE POET AS LOVER,"from the bondage of this individual, in order that beauty in all its"
4831,THE POET AS LOVER,"forms may appeal to one. Shelley writes,"
4832,THE POET AS LOVER,
4833,THE POET AS LOVER,"What storms then shook the ocean of my sleep,"
4834,THE POET AS LOVER,"Blotting that moon, whose pale and waning lips"
4835,THE POET AS LOVER,Then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse.
4836,THE POET AS LOVER,
4837,THE POET AS LOVER,"Finally, the dross of its earthly embodiments being burned away by this"
4838,THE POET AS LOVER,"renunciation, ideal beauty is revealed to the poet, not merely in a"
4839,THE POET AS LOVER,"flash of inspiration, as at the beginning of his quest, but as an"
4840,THE POET AS LOVER,"abiding presence in the soul. At least this is the ideal, but, being a"
4841,THE POET AS LOVER,"poet, Shelley cannot claim the complete merging with the ideal that the"
4842,THE POET AS LOVER,"philosopher possesses. At the supersensual consummation of his love,"
4843,THE POET AS LOVER,"Shelley sinks back, only half conceiving of it, and cries,"
4844,THE POET AS LOVER,
4845,THE POET AS LOVER,Woe is me!
4846,THE POET AS LOVER,The winged words on which my soul would pierce
4847,THE POET AS LOVER,Into the height of Love's rare universe
4848,THE POET AS LOVER,Are chains of lead around its flight of fire;
4849,THE POET AS LOVER,"I pant, I sink, I tremble, I expire."

4856,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN
4857,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
4858,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
4859,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Dare we venture into the holy of holies, where the gods are said to come"
4860,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,upon the poet? Is there not danger that the divine spark which kindles
4861,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"his song may prove a bolt to annihilate us, because of our presumptuous"
4862,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"intrusion? What voice is this, which meets us at the threshold?"
4863,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
4864,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Beware! Beware!
4865,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"His flashing eyes, his floating hair!"
4866,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Weave a circle round him thrice,"
4867,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,And close your eyes in holy dread--
4868,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
4869,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"It is Coleridge, warning us of our peril, if we remain open-eyed and"
4870,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"curious, trying to surprise the secret of the poet's visitation."
4871,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
4872,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Yet are we not tolerably safe? We are under the guidance of an initiate;
4873,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,the poet himself promises to unveil the mystery of his inspiration for
4874,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"us. As Vergil kept Dante unscathed by the flames of the divine vision,"
4875,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,will not our poet protect us? Let us enter.
4876,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
4877,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"But another doubt, a less thrilling one, bids us pause. Is it indeed the"
4878,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"heavenly mystery that we are bid gaze upon, or are we to be the dupe of"
4879,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,self-deceived impostors? Our intimacy is with poets of the last two
4880,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"centuries,--not the most inspired period in the history of poetry. And"
4881,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"in the ranks of our multitudinous verse-writers, it is not the most"
4882,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,prepossessing who are loudest in promising us a fair spectacle. How
4883,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,harsh-voiced and stammering are some of these obscure apostles who are
4884,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,offering to exhibit the entire mystery of their gift of tongues! We see
4885,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"more impressive figures, to be sure. Here is the saturnine Poe, who with"
4886,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,contemptuous smile assures us that we are welcome to all the secrets of
4887,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"his creative frenzies. Here is our exuberant Walt Whitman, crying, ""Stop"
4888,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"this day and night with me, and you shall possess the origin of all"
4889,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"poems."" [Footnote: _Song of Myself_.] But though we scan every face"
4890,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"twice, we find here no Shakespeare promising us the key to creation of a"
4891,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,_Hamlet_.
4892,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
4893,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Still, is it not well to follow a forlorn hope? Among the less"
4894,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"vociferous, here are singers whose faces are alight with a mysterious"
4895,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"radiance. Though they promise us little, saying that they themselves are"
4896,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"blinded by the transcendent vision, so that they appear as men groping"
4897,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"in darkness, yet may they not unawares afford us some glimpse of their"
4898,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,transfiguration?
4899,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
4900,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"If we refuse the poet's revelation, we have no better way of arriving at"
4901,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,the truth. The scientist offers us little in this field; and his account
4902,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,of inspiration is as cold and comfortless as a chemical formula. Of
4903,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"course the scientist is amused by this objection to him, and asks, ""What"
4904,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,more do you expect from the effusions of poets? Will not whatever secret
4905,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,they reveal prove an open one? What will it profit you to learn that the
4906,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"milk of Paradise nourishes the poetic gift, since it is not handled by"
4907,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"an earthly dairy?"" But when he speaks thus, our scientific friend is"
4908,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"merely betraying his ignorance regarding the nature of poetry. Longinus,"
4909,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"[Footnote: _On the Sublime,_ I.] and after him, Sidney, [Footnote:"
4910,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"_Apology for Poetry._] long ago pointed out its peculiar action,"
4911,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,telling us that it is the poet's privilege to make us partakers of his
4912,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"ecstasy. So, if the poet describes his creative impulses, why should he"
4913,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,not make us sharers of them?
4914,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
4915,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"This is not an idle question, for surely Plato, that involuntary poet,"
4916,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"has had just this effect upon his readers. Have not his pictures, in the"
4917,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"_Phaedrus_ and the _Ion_, of the artist's ecstasy touched  Shelley and"
4918,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,the lesser Platonic poets of our time with the enthusiasm he depicts?
4919,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Incidentally, the figure of the magnet which Plato uses in the"
4920,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Ion may arouse hope in the breasts of us, the humblest readers of"
4921,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Shelley and Woodberry. For as one link gives power of suspension to
4922,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"another, so that a ring which is not touched by the magnet is yet"
4923,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"thrilled with its force, so one who is out of touch with Plato's"
4924,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"supernal melodies, may be sensitized by the virtue imparted to his"
4925,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"nineteenth century disciples, who are able to ""temper this planetary"
4926,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"music for mortal ears."""
4927,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
4928,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Let us not lose heart, at the beginning of our investigation, though our"
4929,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,greatest poets admit that they themselves have not been able to keep
4930,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,this creative ecstasy for long. To be sure this is disillusioning. We
4931,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,should prefer to think of their silent intervals as times of insight too
4932,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"deep for expression; as Anna Branch phrases it,"
4933,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
4934,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,When they went
4935,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Unto the fullness of their great content
4936,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Like moths into the grass with folded wings.
4937,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _The Silence of the Poets._]
4938,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
4939,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,This pleasing idea has been fostered in us by poems of appeal to silent
4940,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"singers. [Footnote: See Swinburne, _A Ballad of Appeal to Christina"
4941,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Rossetti_; and Francis Thompson, _To a Poet Breaking Silence_.]"
4942,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,But we have manifold confessions that it is not commonly thus with the
4943,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,non-productive poet. Not merely do we possess many requiems sung by
4944,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"erst-while makers over their departed gift, [Footnote: See especially"
4945,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Scott, _Farewell to the Muse_; Kirke White, _Hushed is the Lyre_;"
4946,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Landor, _Dull is My Verse_, and _To Wordsworth_; James Thomson, B. V.,"
4947,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"_The Fire that Filled My Heart of Old_, and _The Poet and the Muse_;"
4948,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Joaquin Miller, _Vale_; Andrew Lang, _The Poet's Apology_; Francis"
4949,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Thompson, _The Cloud's Swan Song_.] but there is much verse indicating"
4950,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"that, even in the poet's prime, his genius is subject to a mysterious"
4951,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"ebb and flow. [Footnote: See Burns, _Second Epistle to Lapraik_; Keats,"
4952,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"_To My Brother George_; Winthrop Mackworth Praed, _Letter from Eaton_;"
4953,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"William Cullen Bryant, _The Poet_; Oliver Wendell Holmes, _Invita"

4960,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Haven Schauffler, _The Wonderful Hour_; Henry A. Beers, _The Thankless"
4961,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Muse_; Karl Wilson Baker, _Days_.] Though he has faith that he is not"
4962,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"""widowed of his muse,"" [Footnote: See Francis Thompson, _The Cloud's"
4963,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Swan Song_.] she yet torments him with all the ways of a coquette, so"
4964,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"that he sadly assures us his mistress ""is sweet to win, but bitter to"
4965,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"keep."" [Footnote: C. G. Roberts, _Ballade of the Poet's Thought_.] The"
4966,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"times when she solaces him may be pitifully infrequent. Rossetti, musing"
4967,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"over Coleridge, says that his inspired moments were"
4968,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
4969,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Like desert pools that show the stars
4970,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Once in long leagues.
4971,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _Sonnet to Coleridge_.]
4972,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
4973,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Yet, even so, upon such moments of insight rest all the poet's claims"
4974,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,for his superior personality. It is the potential greatness enabling him
4975,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,at times to have speech with the gods that makes the rest of his life
4976,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,sacred. Emerson is more outspoken than most poets; he is not perhaps at
4977,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"variance with their secret convictions, when he describes himself:"
4978,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
4979,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"I, who cower mean and small"
4980,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,In the frequent interval
4981,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,When wisdom not with me resides.
4982,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _The Poet_.]
4983,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
4984,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,However divine the singer considers himself in comparison with ordinary
4985,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"humanity, he must admit that at times"
4986,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
4987,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Discrowned and timid, thoughtless, worn,"
4988,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"The child of genius sits forlorn,"
4989,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,*       *       *       *       *
4990,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"A cripple of God, half-true, half-formed."
4991,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"[Footnote: Emerson, _The Poet_. See also George Meredith, _Pegasus_.]"
4992,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
4993,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Like Dante, we seem disposed to faint at every step in our revelation."
4994,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Now a doubt crosses our minds whether the child of genius in his
4995,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,crippled moments is better fitted than the rest of us to point out the
4996,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,pathway to sacred enthusiasm. It appears that little verse describing
4997,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,the poet's afflatus is written when the gods are actually with him. In
4998,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"this field, the sower sows by night. Verse on inspiration is almost"
4999,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,always retrospective or theoretical in character. It seems as if the
5000,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,intermittence of his inspiration filled the poet with a wistful
5001,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,curiosity as to his nature in moments of soaring. By continual
5002,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"introspection he is seeking the charm, so to speak, that will render his"
5003,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"afflatus permanent. The rigidity in much of such verse surely betrays,"
5004,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"not the white heat of genius, but a self-conscious attitude of readiness"
5005,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,for the falling of the divine spark.
5006,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5007,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,One wonders whether such preparation has been of much value in hastening
5008,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,the fire from heaven. Often the reader is impatient to inform the
5009,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,loud-voiced suppliant that Baal has gone a-hunting. Yet it is alleged
5010,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,that the most humble bribe has at times sufficed to capture the elusive
5011,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"divinity. Schiller's rotten apples are classic, and Emerson lists a"
5012,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"number of tested expedients, from a pound of tea to a night in a strange"
5013,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,hotel. [Footnote: See the essay on Inspiration. Hazlitt says Coleridge
5014,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,liked to compose walking over uneven ground or breaking through
5015,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"straggling branches.] This, however, is Emerson in a singularly"
5016,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"flat-footed moment. The real poet scoffs at such suggestions. Instead,"
5017,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,he feels that it is not for him to know the times and seasons of his
5018,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"powers. Indeed, it seems to him, sometimes, that pure contrariety marks"
5019,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,the god's refusal to come when entreated. Thus we are told of the god of
5020,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"song,"
5021,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5022,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Vainly, O burning poets!"
5023,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Ye wait for his inspiration.
5024,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,*       *       *       *       *
5025,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Hasten back, he will say, hasten back"
5026,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"To your provinces far away!  There, at my own good time"
5027,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Will I send my answer to you.
5028,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"[Footnote: E. C. Stedman, _Apollo_. _The Hillside Door_ by the same"
5029,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"author also expresses this idea. See also Browning, _Old Pictures"
5030,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"in Florence_, in which he speaks ""of a gift God gives me now and then."""
5031,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"See also Longfellow, _L'Envoi_; Keats, _On Receiving a Laurel Crown_;"
5032,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Cale Young Rice, _New Dreams for Old_; Fiona Macleod, _The Founts of"
5033,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Song_.]
5034,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5035,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Then, at the least expected moment, the fire may fall, so that the poet"
5036,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,is often filled with naïve wonder at his own ability. Thus Alice Meynell
5037,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"greets one of her poems,"
5038,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5039,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Who looked for thee, thou little song of mine?"
5040,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,This winter of a silent poet's heart
5041,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Is suddenly sweet with thee, but what thou art,"
5042,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Mid-winter flower, I would I could divine."
5043,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5044,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"But if the poet cannot predict the time of his afflatus, he indicates"
5045,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,that he does know the attitude of mind which will induce it. In certain
5046,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,quarters there is a truly Biblical reliance upon faith as bringer of the
5047,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"gift. A minor writer assures us, ""Ah, if we trust, comes the song!"""
5048,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"[Footnote: Richard Burton, _Singing Faith_.] Emerson says,"
5049,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5050,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,The muses' hill by fear is guarded;
5051,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,A bolder foot is still rewarded.
5052,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _The Poet_.]
5053,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5054,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,And more extreme is the counsel of Owen Meredith to the aspiring artist:
5055,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5056,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,The genius on thy daily walks
5057,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Shall meet, and take thee by the hand;"
5058,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,But serve him not as who obeys;
5059,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,He is thy slave if thou command.
5060,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _The Artist_.]
5061,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5062,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,The average artist is probably inclined to quarrel with this last
5063,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,high-handed treatment of the muse. Reverent humility rather than
5064,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,arrogance characterizes the most effectual appeals for inspiration. The
5065,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"faith of the typical poet is not the result of boldness, but of an"
5066,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,aspiration so intense that it entails forgetfulness of self. Thus one
5067,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,poet accounts for his inspired hour:
5068,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5069,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Purged with high thoughts and infinite desire
5070,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,I entered fearless the most holy place;
5071,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Received between my lips the sacred fire,"
5072,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,The breath of inspiration on my face.
5073,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"[Footnote: C. G. Roberts, _Ave_.]"
5074,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5075,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Another writer stresses the efficacy of longing no less strongly;
5076,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,speaking of
5077,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5078,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"The unsatiated, insatiable desire"
5079,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Which at once mocks and makes all poesy.
5080,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"[Footnote: William Alexander, _The Finding of the Book_. See also Edward"
5081,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Dowden, _The Artist's Waiting_.]"
5082,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5083,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,There is nothing new in this. It is only what the poet has implied in
5084,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,all his confessions. Was he inspired by love? It was because thwarted
5085,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"love filled him with intensest longing. So with his thirst for purity,"
5086,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"for religion, for worldly vanities. Any desire, be it fierce enough, and"
5087,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"hindered from immediate satisfaction, may engender poetry. As Joyce"
5088,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Kilmer phrases it,"
5089,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5090,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Nothing keeps a poet
5091,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"In his high singing mood,"
5092,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Like unappeasable hunger
5093,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,For unattainable food.
5094,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _Apology_.]
5095,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5096,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,But the poet would not have us imagine that we have here sounded the
5097,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"depths of the mystery. Aspiration may call down inspiration, but it is"
5098,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,not synonymous with it. Mrs. Browning is fond of pointing out this
5099,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"distinction. In _Aurora Leigh_ she reminds us, ""Many a fervid man"
5100,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"writes books as cold and flat as gravestones."" In the same poem she"
5101,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"indicates that desire is merely preliminary to inspiration. There are,"
5102,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"she says,"
5103,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5104,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Two states of the recipient artist-soul;
5105,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"One forward, personal, wanting reverence,"
5106,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Because aspiring only. We'll be calm,"
5107,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"And know that when indeed our Joves come down,"
5108,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,We all turn stiller than we have ever been.
5109,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5110,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"What is this mysterious increment, that must be added to aspiration"
5111,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,before it becomes poetically creative? So far as a mere layman can
5112,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"understand it, it is a sudden arrest, rather than a satisfaction, of the"
5113,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"poet's longing, for genuine satisfaction would kill the aspiration, and"
5114,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"leave the poet heavy and phlegmatic. Inspiration, on the contrary, seems"
5115,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,to give him a fictitious satisfaction; it is an arrest of his desire
5116,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"that affords him a delicate poise and repose, on tiptoe, so to speak."
5117,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"[Footnote: Compare Coleridge's statement that poetry is ""a more than"
5118,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"usual state of emotion with more than usual order."" _Biographia"
5119,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Literaria_, Vol. II, Chap. I, p. 14, ed. Henry Nelson Coleridge.]"
5120,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5121,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Does not the fact that inspiration works in this manner account for the
5122,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,immemorial connection of poetic creativeness with Bacchic frenzy? To the
5123,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"aspiring poet wine does not bring his mistress, nor virtue, nor"
5124,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"communion with God, nor any object of his longing. Yet it does bring a"
5125,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"sudden ease to his craving. So, wherever there is a romantic conception"
5126,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"of poetry, one is apt to find inspiration compared to intoxication."
5127,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5128,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Such an idea did not, of course, find favor among typical eighteenth"
5129,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"century writers. Indeed, they would have seen more reason in ascribing"
5130,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"their clear-witted verse to an ice-pack, than to the bibulous hours"
5131,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,preceding its application to the fevered brow. We must wait for William
5132,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Blake before we can expect Bacchus to be reinstated among the gods of
5133,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"song. Blake does not disappoint us, for we find his point of view"
5134,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"expressed, elegantly enough, in his comment on artists, ""And when they"
5135,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"are drunk, they always paint best."" [Footnote: _Artist Madmen: On the"

5138,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5139,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"As the romantic movement progresses, one meets with more lyrical"
5140,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"expositions of the power in strong drink. Burns, especially, is never"
5141,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"tired of sounding its praise. He exclaims,"
5142,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,

5179,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"James Russell Lowell, in _The Temptation of Hassan Khaled_,"
5180,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,presents the argument of the poet's tempters with charming sympathy:
5181,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5182,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,The vine is nature's poet: from his bloom
5183,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"The air goes reeling, typsy with perfume,"
5184,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,And when the sun is warm within his blood
5185,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"It mounts and sparkles in a crimson flood,"
5186,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Rich with dumb songs he speaks not, till they find"
5187,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Interpretation in the poet's mind.
5188,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"If wine be evil, song is evil too."
5189,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5190,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,His _Bacchic Ode_ is full of the same enthusiasm. Bacchus received
5191,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,his highest honors at the end of the last century from the decadents in

5197,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"was drawn into the contest, and warmed to the theme."
5198,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5199,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Poetry about the Mermaid Inn is bound to take this tone. From Keats
5200,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: See _Lines on the Mermaid Inn_.] to Josephine Preston
5201,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Peabody [Footnote: See _Marlowe_.] writers on the Elizabethan
5202,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,dramatists have dwelt upon their conviviality. This aspect is especially
5203,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"stressed by Alfred Noyes, who imagines himself carried back across the"
5204,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,centuries to become the Ganymede of the great poets. All of the group
5205,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,keep him busy. In particular he mentions Jonson:
5206,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5207,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"And Ben was there,"
5208,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Humming a song upon the old black settle,"
5209,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"""Or leave a kiss within the cup"
5210,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"And I'll not ask for wine,"""

5213,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5214,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Fortunately for the future of American verse, there is another side to"
5215,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,the picture. The teetotaler poet is by no means non-existent in the last
5216,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"century. Wordsworth takes pains to refer to himself as ""a simple,"
5217,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"water-drinking bard,"" [Footnote: See _The Waggoner_.] and in lines"
5218,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,_To the Sons of Burns_ he delivers a very fine prohibition lecture.
5219,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Tennyson offers us _Will Waterproof's Lyrical Monologue, a reductio ad"
5220,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"absurdum_ of the claims of the bibulous bard. Then, lest the"

5222,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"title character of _Michael Angelo_ to inform us that he ""loves not"
5223,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"wine,"" while, more recently, E. A. Robinson pictures Shakespeare's"

5232,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5233,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"No, the poet will not allow us to take his words too seriously, lest we"
5234,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,drag down Apollo to the level of Bacchus. In spite of the convincing
5235,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"realism in certain eulogies, it is clear that to the poet, as to the"
5236,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"convert at the eucharist, wine is only a symbol of a purely spiritual"
5237,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"ecstasy. But if intoxication is only a figure of speech, it is a"
5238,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"significant one, and perhaps some of the other myths describing the"
5239,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,poet's sensations during inspiration may put us on the trail of its
5240,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"meaning. Of course, in making such an assumption, we are precisely like"
5241,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"the expounder of Plato's myths, who is likely to say, ""Here Plato was"
5242,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"attempting to shadow forth the inexpressible. Now listen, and I will"
5243,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"explain exactly what he meant."" Notwithstanding, we must proceed."
5244,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5245,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"The device of Chaucer's _House of Fame_, wherein the poet is carried to"
5246,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"celestial realms by an eagle, occasionally occurs to the modern poet as"
5247,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"an account of his _Aufschwung_. Thus Keats, in _Lines to Apollo_, avers,"
5248,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5249,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Aye, when the soul is fled"
5250,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Too high above our head,"
5251,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Affrighted do we gaze

5258,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Browning, likening herself to Ganymede, ravished from his sheep to the"
5259,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"summit of Olympus. The same attitude is apparent in most of her poems,"
5260,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"for Mrs. Browning, in singing mood, is precisely like a child in a"
5261,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"swing, shouting with delight at every fresh sensation of soaring."
5262,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"[Footnote: See J. G. Percival, _Genius Awaking_, for the same"

5264,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5265,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Again, the crash of the poet's inspiration upon his ordinary modes of"
5266,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"thought is compared to ""fearful claps of thunder,"" by Keats [Footnote:"
5267,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"See _Sleep and Poetry_.] and others. [Footnote: See _The Master_, A. E."
5268,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Cheney.] Or, more often, his moment of sudden insight seems a lightning"
5269,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,flash upon the dark ways in which he is ordinarily groping. Keats says
5270,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,that his early visions were seen as through a rift of sheet lightning.
5271,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: See _The Epistle to George Keats_.] Emerson's impression is
5272,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"the same; visions come ""as if life were a thunderstorm wherein you can"
5273,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"see by a flash the horizon, and then cannot see your hand."" [Footnote:"
5274,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"_Essay on Inspiration_.] Likewise Alexander Smith declares,"
5275,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5276,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Across the midnight sea of mind
5277,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,A thought comes streaming like a blazing ship
5278,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Upon a mighty wind,"
5279,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"A terror and a glory! Shocked with light,"
5280,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,His boundless being glares aghast.
5281,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _A Life Drama_.]
5282,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5283,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Perhaps this is a true expression of the poet's feelings during the
5284,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"deepest inspiration, yet we are minded of Elijah's experience with the"
5285,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,wind and the fire and the still small voice. So we cannot help
5286,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"sympathizing with Browning's protest against ""friend Naddo's"" view that"
5287,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,genius is a matter of bizarre and grandiose sensations. [Footnote:
5288,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"_Sordello_.] At least it is pleasant to find verse, by minor"
5289,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"writers though it be, describing the quietude and naturalness of the"
5290,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,poet's best moments. Thus Holmes tells us of his inspiration:
5291,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5292,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Soft as the moonbeams when they sought
5293,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Endymion's fragrant bower,"
5294,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,She parts the whispering leaves of thought
5295,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,To show her full-leaved flower.
5296,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _Invita Minerva_.]
5297,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5298,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Edwin Markham says,"
5299,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5300,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,She comes like the hush and beauty of the night.
5301,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _Poetry_.]
5302,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5303,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,And Richard Watson Gilder's mood is the same:
5304,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5305,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,How to the singer comes his song?
5306,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,How to the summer fields
5307,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Come flowers? How yields
5308,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Darkness to happy dawn? How doth the night
5309,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Bring stars?
5310,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _How to the Singer Comes His Song?_]
5311,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5312,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Various as are these accounts which poets give of their inspired
5313,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"moments, all have one point in common, since they indicate that in such"
5314,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,moments the poet is wholly passive. His thought is literally given to
5315,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"him. Edward Dowden, in a sonnet, _Wise Passiveness_, says this"
5316,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,plainly:
5317,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5318,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Think you I choose or that or this to sing?
5319,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,I lie as patient as yon wealthy stream
5320,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Dreaming among green fields its summer dream,"
5321,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Which takes whate'er the gracious hours will bring
5322,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Into its quiet bosom.
5323,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5324,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"To the same effect is a somewhat prosaic poem, _Accident in Art_,"
5325,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"by Richard Hovey. He inquires,"
5326,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5327,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,What poet has not found his spirit kneeling
5328,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,A sudden at the sound of such or such
5329,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Strange verses staring from his manuscript,"
5330,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Written, he knows not how, but which will sound"
5331,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Like trumpets down the years.
5332,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5333,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Doubtless it is a very natural result of his resignation to this
5334,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,creative force that one of the poet's profoundest sensations during his
5335,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,afflatus should be that of reverence for his gift. Longfellow and
5336,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Wordsworth sometimes speak as if the composition of their poems were a
5337,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,ceremony comparable to high mass. At times one must admit that verse
5338,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,describing such an attitude has a charm of its own. [Footnote: Compare
5339,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Browning's characterization of the afflatus of Eglamor in _Sordello_,"
5340,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Book II.] In _The Song-Tree_ Alfred Noyes describes his first sensation
5341,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,as a conscious poet:
5342,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5343,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"The first note that I heard,"
5344,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"A magical undertone,"
5345,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Was sweeter than any bird
5346,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,--Or so it seemed to me--
5347,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,And my tears ran wild.
5348,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"This tale, this tale is true."
5349,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"The light was growing gray,"
5350,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,And the rhymes ran so sweet
5351,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,(For I was only a child)
5352,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,That I knelt down to pray.
5353,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5354,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,But our sympathy with this little poet would not be nearly so intense
5355,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"were he twenty years older. When it is said of a mature poetess,"
5356,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5357,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,She almost shrank
5358,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,To feel the secret and expanding might
5359,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Of her own mind,"
5360,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"[Footnote: _The Last Hours of a Young Poetess_, Lucy Hooper.]"
5361,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5362,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,the reader does not always remain in a sympathetically prayerful mind.
5363,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Such reverence paid by the poet to his gift calls to mind the multiple
5364,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Miss Beauchamp, of psychologic fame, and her comment on the vagaries of"
5365,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"her various personalities, ""But after all, they are all me!"" Too often,"
5366,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"when the poet is kneeling in adoration of his Muse, the irreverent"
5367,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"reader is likely to suspect that he realizes, only too well, that it is"
5368,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"""all me."""
5369,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5370,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"However, if the Philistine reader sets up as a critic, he must make good"
5371,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,his charges. Have we any real grounds for declaring that the alleged
5372,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"divinity who inspires the poet is merely his own intelligence, or lack"
5373,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,of it? Perhaps not. And yet the dabbler in psychology finds a good deal
5374,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"to indicate the poet's impression that the ""subconscious"" is shaping his"
5375,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,verse. Shelley was especially fascinated by the mysterious regions of
5376,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"his mind lying below the threshold of his ordinary thought. In fact,"
5377,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,some of his prose speculations are in remarkable sympathy with recent
5378,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,scientific papers on the subject. [Footnote: See _Speculations on
5379,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Metaphysics_, Works, Vol. VI, p. 282, edited by Buxton Forman.] And"
5380,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,in _Mont Blanc_ he expresses his wonder at the phenomenon of
5381,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,thought:
5382,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5383,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,The everlasting universe of things
5384,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Flows through the mind, and rolls its rapid waves,"
5385,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Now dark--now glittering--now reflecting gloom--
5386,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Now lending splendor, where from secret springs"
5387,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,The source of human thought its tribute brings
5388,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Of waters.
5389,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5390,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Again, in _The Defense of Poetry_ he says,"
5391,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5392,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"The mind in creation is a fading coal, which some invisible"
5393,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"influence, like an inconstant wind, awakens to transitory"
5394,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"brightness; this power arises from within, like the color of a"
5395,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"flower which fades and changes as it is developed, and the"
5396,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,conscious portions of our nature are unprophetic either of its
5397,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,approach or departure.
5398,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5399,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Wordsworth, too, thinks of his gift as arising from the depths of his"
5400,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"mind, which are not subject to conscious control. He apprises us,"
5401,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5402,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,A plastic power
5403,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Abode with me, a forming hand, at times"
5404,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Rebellious, acting in a devious mood,"
5405,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"A local spirit of its own, at war"
5406,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"With general tendency, but for the most"
5407,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Subservient strictly to external things
5408,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,With which it communed. An auxiliary light
5409,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Came from my mind which on the setting sun
5410,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Bestowed new splendor--
5411,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _The Prelude_.]
5412,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5413,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Occasionally the sudden lift of these submerged ideas to consciousness
5414,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,is expressed by the figure of an earthquake. Aurora Leigh says that upon
5415,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"her first impulse to write, her nature was shaken,"
5416,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5417,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,As the earth
5418,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Plunges in fury, when the internal fires"
5419,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Have reached and pricked her heart, and throwing flat"
5420,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"The marts and temples, the triumphal gates"
5421,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"And towers of observation, clears herself"
5422,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,To elemental freedom.
5423,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5424,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"We have a grander expression of the idea from Robert Browning, who"
5425,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,relates how the vision of _Sordello_ arises to consciousness:
5426,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5427,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Upthrust, out-staggering on the world,"
5428,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Subsiding into shape, a darkness rears"
5429,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Its outline, kindles at the core--."
5430,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5431,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Is this to say that the poet's intuitions, apparently so sudden, have"
5432,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,really been long germinating in the obscure depths of his mind? Then it
5433,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"is in tune with the idea, so prevalent in English verse, that in sleep a"
5434,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,mysterious undercurrent of imaginative power becomes accessible to the
5435,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,poet.
5436,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5437,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"""Ever when slept the poet his dreams were music,"" [Footnote: _The"
5438,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Poet's Sleep_.] says Richard Gilder, and the line seems trite to us."
5439,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"There was surely no reason why Keats' title, _Sleep and Poetry_,"
5440,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"should have appeared ludicrous to his critics, for from the time of"
5441,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Caedmon onward English writers have been sensitive to a connection here.
5442,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"The stereotyped device of making poetry a dream vision, so popular in"
5443,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"the middle ages,--and even the prominence of _Night Thoughts_ in"
5444,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,eighteenth century verse--testify that a coupling of poetry and sleep
5445,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"has always seemed natural to poets. Coleridge, [Footnote: See his"
5446,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"account of the composition of _Kubla Khan_.] Keats, Shelley, [Footnote:"
5447,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"See _Alastor_, and _Prince Athanase_. See also Edmund Gosse,"
5448,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"_Swinburne_, p. 29, where Swinburne says he produced the first three"
5449,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,stanzas of _A Vision of Spring_ in his sleep.]--it is the romanticists
5450,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,who seem to have depended most upon sleep as bringer of inspiration. And
5451,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"once more, it is Shelley who shows himself most keenly aware that,"
5452,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"asleep or waking, the poet feels his afflatus coming in the same manner."
5453,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Thus he tells us of the singer in _Prince Athanase:_
5454,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5455,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"And through his sleep, and o'er each waking hour"
5456,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Thoughts after thoughts, unresting multitudes,"
5457,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Were driven within him by some secret power
5458,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Which bade them blaze, and live, and roll afar,"
5459,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Like lights and sounds, from haunted tower to tower."
5460,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5461,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Probably our jargon of the subconscious would not much impress poets,"
5462,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"even those whom we have just quoted. Is this the only cause we can give,"
5463,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Shelley might ask, why the poet should not reverence his gift as"
5464,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"something apart from himself and truly divine? If, after the fashion of"
5465,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"modern psychology, we denote by the subconscious mind only the welter of"
5466,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"myriad forgotten details of our daily life, what is there here to"
5467,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"account for poesy? The remote, inaccessible chambers of our mind may, to"
5468,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"be sure, be more replete with curious lumber than those continually"
5469,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"swept and garnished for everyday use, yet, even so, there is nothing in"
5470,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"any memory, as such, to account for the fact that poetry reveals things"
5471,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,to us above and beyond any of our actual experiences in this world.
5472,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5473,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Alchemist Memory turned his past to gold,"
5474,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _A Life Drama._]
5475,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5476,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"says Alexander Smith of his poet, and as an account of inspiration, the"
5477,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,line sounds singularly flat. There is nothing here to distinguish the
5478,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,poet from any octogenarian dozing in his armchair.
5479,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5480,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Is Memory indeed the only Muse? Not unless she is a far grander figure
5481,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,than we ordinarily suppose. Of course she has been exalted by certain
5482,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"artists. There is Richard Wagner, with his definition of art as memory"
5483,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"of one's past youth, or--to stay closer home--Wordsworth, with his"
5484,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"theory of poetry as emotion recollected in tranquillity,--such artists"
5485,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"have a high regard for memory. Still, Oliver Wendell Holmes is tolerably"
5486,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,representative of the nineteenth century attitude when he points memory
5487,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"to a second place. It is only the aged poet, conscious that his powers"
5488,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"are decaying, to whom Holmes offers the consolation,"
5489,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5490,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Live in the past; await no more
5491,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,The rush of heaven-sent wings;
5492,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Earth still has music left in store
5493,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,While memory sighs and sings.
5494,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _Invita Minerva_.]
5495,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5496,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"But, though he would discourage us from our attempt to chain his genius,"
5497,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"like a ghost, to his past life in this world, the poet is inclined to"
5498,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"admit that Mnemosyne, in her true grandeur, has a fair claim to her"
5499,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"title as mother of the muses. The memories of prosaic men may be, as we"
5500,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"have described them, short and sordid, concerned only with their"
5501,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"existence here and now, but the recollection of poets is a divine thing,"
5502,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,reaching back to the days when their spirits were untrammeled by the
5503,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"body, and they gazed upon ideal beauty, when, as Plato says, they saw a"
5504,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,vision and were initiated into the most blessed mysteries ... beholding
5505,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,apparitions innocent and simple and calm and happy as in a mystery;
5506,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"shining in pure light, pure themselves and not yet enshrined in the"
5507,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"living tomb which we carry about, now that we are imprisoned in the"
5508,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"body, as in an oyster shell. [Footnote: _Phaedrus_, 250.]"
5509,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5510,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,For the poet is apt to transfer Plato's praise of the philosopher to
5511,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"himself, declaring that ""he alone has wings, and this is just, for he is"
5512,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"always, according to the measure of his abilities, clinging in"
5513,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"recollection to those things in which God abides, and in beholding which"
5514,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"He is what He is."" [Footnote: _Ibid_., 249.]"
5515,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5516,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"If the poet exalts memory to this station, he may indeed claim that he"
5517,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"is not furtively adoring his own petty powers, when he reverences the"
5518,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,visions which Mnemosyne vouchsafes to him. And indeed Plato's account of
5519,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,memory is congenial to many poets. Shelley is probably the most serious
5520,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,of the nineteenth century singers in claiming an ideal life for the
5521,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"soul, before its birth into this world. [Footnote: See _Prince"
5522,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Athanase_. For Matthew Arnold's views, see _Self Deception_.]"
5523,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Wordsworth's adherence to this view is as widely known as the _Ode on
5524,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Immortality_. As an explanation for inspiration, the theory recurs in"
5525,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"verse of other poets. One writer inquires,"
5526,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5527,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Are these wild thoughts, thus fettered in my rhymes,"
5528,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Indeed the product of my heart and brain?
5529,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"[Footnote: Henry Timrod, _Sonnet_.]"
5530,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5531,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,and decides that the only way to account for the occasional gleams of
5532,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,insight in his verse is by assuming a prenatal life for the soul.
5533,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Another maintains of poetry,"
5534,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5535,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Her touch is a vibration and a light
5536,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,From worlds before and after.
5537,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"[Footnote: Edwin Markham, _Poetry_. Another recent poem on prenatal"
5538,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"inspiration is _The Dream I Dreamed Before I Was Born_ (1919), by"
5539,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Dorothea Laurence Mann.]
5540,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5541,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Perhaps Alice Meynell's _A Song of Derivations_ is the most natural
5542,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,and unforced of these verses. She muses:
5543,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5544,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,... Mixed with memories not my own
5545,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,The sweet streams throng into my breast.
5546,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Before this life began to be
5547,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,The happy songs that wake in me
5548,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Woke long ago, and far apart."
5549,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Heavily on this little heart
5550,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Presses this immortality.
5551,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5552,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"This poem, however, is not so consistent as the others with the Platonic"
5553,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"theory of reminiscence. It is a previous existence in this world, rather"
5554,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"than in ideal realms, which Alice Meynell assumes for her inspirations."
5555,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"She continues,"
5556,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5557,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"I come from nothing, but from where"
5558,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Come the undying thoughts I bear?
5559,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Down through long links of death and birth,"
5560,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"From the past poets of the earth,"
5561,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,My immortality is there.
5562,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5563,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Certain singers who seem not to have been affected by the philosophical
5564,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,argument for reminiscence have concurred in Alice Meynell's last
5565,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"statement, and have felt that the mysterious power which is impressing"
5566,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"itself in their verse is the genius of dead poets, mysteriously finding"
5567,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,expression in their disciple's song. A characteristic example of this
5568,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"attitude is Alfred Noyes' account of Chapman's sensations, when he"
5569,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,attempted to complete Marlowe's _Hero and Leander_. Chapman tells
5570,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,his brother poets:
5571,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5572,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"I have thought, sometimes, when I have tried"
5573,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"To work his will, the hand that moved my pen"
5574,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Was mine and yet--not mine. The bodily mask
5575,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Is mine, and sometimes dull as clay it sleeps"
5576,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"With old Musaeus. Then strange flashes come,"
5577,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Oracular glories, visionary gleams,"
5578,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"And the mask moves, not of itself, and sings."
5579,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _At the Sign of the Golden Shoe_.]
5580,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5581,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"The best-known instance of such a belief is, of course, Browning's"
5582,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"appeal at the beginning of _The Ring and the Book_, that his dead"
5583,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,wife shall inspire his poetry.
5584,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5585,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"One is tempted to surmise that many of our young poets, especially have"
5586,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,nourished a secret conviction that their genius has such an origin as
5587,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,this. Let there be a deification of some poet who has aroused their
5588,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"special enthusiasm,--a mysterious resemblance to his style in the works"
5589,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"which arise in their minds spontaneously, in moments of ecstasy,--what"
5590,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"is a more natural result than the assumption that their genius is, in"
5591,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"some strange manner, a continuation of his? [Footnote: Keats wrote to"
5592,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Haydn that he took encouragement in the notion of some good
5593,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,genius--probably Shakespeare--presiding over him. Swinburne was often
5594,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,called Shelley reborn.] The tone of certain Shelley worshipers suggests
5595,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,such a hypothesis as an account for their poems. Bayard Taylor seems to
5596,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"be an exception when, after pleading that Shelley infuse his spirit into"
5597,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"his disciple's verses, he recalls himself, and concludes:"
5598,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5599,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"I do but rave, for it is better thus;"
5600,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Were once thy starry nature given to mine,"
5601,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,In the one life which would encircle us
5602,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"My voice would melt, my voice be lost in thine;"
5603,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Better to bear the far sublimer pain
5604,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Of thought that has not ripened into speech.
5605,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,To hear in silence Truth and Beauty sing
5606,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Divinely to the brain;
5607,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,For thus the poet at the last shall reach
5608,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"His own soul's voice, nor crave a brother's string."
5609,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _Ode to Shelly._]
5610,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5611,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"In the theory that the genius of a past poet may be reincarnated, there"
5612,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"is, indeed, a danger that keeps it from appealing to all poets. It"
5613,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"tallies too well with the charge of imitativeness, if not downright"
5614,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"plagiarism, often brought against a new singer. [Footnote: See Margaret"
5615,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Steele Anderson, _Other People's Wreaths,_ and John Drinkwater,"
5616,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,_My Songs._] If the poet feels that his genius comes from a power
5617,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"outside himself, he yet paradoxically insists that it must be peculiarly"
5618,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"his own. Therefore Mrs. Browning, through Aurora Leigh, shrinks from the"
5619,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,suspicion that her gift may be a heritage from singers before her. She
5620,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,wistfully inquires:
5621,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5622,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"My own best poets, am I one with you?"
5623,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,". . . When my joy and pain,"
5624,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"My thought and aspiration, like the stops"
5625,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Of pipe or flute, are absolutely dumb"
5626,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Unless melodious, do you play on me,"
5627,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"My pipers, and if, sooth, you did not play,"
5628,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Would no sound come? Or is the music mine;
5629,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"As a man's voice or breath is called his own,"
5630,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Inbreathed by the life-breather?
5631,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5632,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Are we exaggerating our modern poet's conviction that a spirit not his
5633,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,own is inspiring him? Does he not rather feel self-sufficient as
5634,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"compared with the earlier singers, who expressed such naïve dependence"
5635,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,upon the Muse? We have been using the name Muse in this essay merely as
5636,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"a figure of speech, and is this not the poet's usage when he addresses"
5637,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"her? The casual reader is inclined to say, yes, that a belief in the"
5638,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Muse is indeed dead. It would be absurd on the face of it, he might say,"
5639,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,to expect a belief in this pagan figure to persist after all the rest of
5640,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,the Greek theogony has become a mere literary device to us. This may not
5641,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"be a reliable supposition, since as a matter of fact Milton and Dante"
5642,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"impress us as being quite as deeply sincere as Homer, when they call"
5643,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,upon the Muse to aid them in their song. But at any rate everyone is
5644,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,conscious that such a belief has degenerated before the eighteenth
5645,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,century. The complacent turner of couplets felt no genuine need for any
5646,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Muse but his own keen intelligence; accordingly, though the machinery of"
5647,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"invocation persists in his poetry, it is as purely an introductory"
5648,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"flourish as is the ornamented initial letter of a poem. Indeed, as the"
5649,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"century progresses, not even the pose of serious prayer is always kept"
5650,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,up. John Hughes is perhaps the most persistent and sober intreater of
5651,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"the Muse whom we find during this period, yet when he compliments the"
5652,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Muse upon her appearance ""at Lucinda's tea-table,"" [Footnote: See _On"
5653,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Lucinda's Tea-table_.] one feels that all awe of her has vanished. It
5654,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"is no wonder that James Thomson, writing verses _On the Death of His"
5655,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Mother_, should disclaim the artificial aid of the muses, saying that"
5656,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,his own deep feeling was enough to inspire him. As the romantic movement
5657,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"progressed, it would be easy to show that distaste for the eighteenth"
5658,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,century mannerism resulted in more and more flippant treatment of the
5659,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"goddesses. Beattie refers to a contemporary's ""reptile Muse, swollen"
5660,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"from the sty."" [Footnote: See _On a Report of a Monument to a Late"
5661,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Author_.] Burns alludes to his own Muse as a ""tapitless ramfeezled"
5662,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"hizzie,"" [Footnote: See the _Epistle to Lapraik_.] and sets the"
5663,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"fashion for succeeding writers, who so multiply the original nine that"
5664,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"each poet has an individual muse, a sorry sort of guardian-angel, whom"
5665,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,he is fond of berating for her lack of ability. One never finds a writer
5666,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"nowadays, with courage to refer to his muse otherwise than"
5667,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"apologetically. The usual tone is that of Andrew Lang, when he"
5668,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"confesses, apropos of the departure of his poetic gift:"
5669,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5670,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,'Twas not much at any time
5671,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"She could hitch into a rhyme,"
5672,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Never was the muse sublime
5673,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Who has fled.
5674,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _A Poet's Apology_.]
5675,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5676,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Yet one would be wrong in maintaining that the genuine poet of to-day
5677,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,feels a slighter dependence upon a spirit of song than did the world's
5678,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"earlier singers. There are, of course, certain poetasters now, as"
5679,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"always, whose verse is ground out as if by machinery, and who are as"
5680,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,little likely to call upon an outside power to aid them as is the horse
5681,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"that treads the cider mill. But among true poets, if the spirit who"
5682,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"inspires poesy is a less definitely personified figure than of old, she"
5683,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,is no less a sincerely conceived one and reverently worshiped. One
5684,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,doubts if there could be found a poet of merit who would disagree with
5685,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Shelley's description of poetry as ""the inter-penetration of a diviner"
5686,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"nature through our own."" [Footnote: _Defense of Poetry_.]"
5687,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5688,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"What is the poet's conception of such a divinity? It varies, of course."
5689,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"There is the occasional belief, just mentioned, in the transmigration of"
5690,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"genius, but that goes back, in the end, to the belief that all genius is"
5691,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"a memory of pre-existence; that is, dropping (or varying) the myth, that"
5692,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"the soul of the poet is not chained to the physical world, but has the"
5693,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"power of discerning the things which abide. And this, again, links up"
5694,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"with what is perhaps the commonest form of invocation in modern poetry,"
5695,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"namely, prayer that God, the spirit of the universe, may inspire the"
5696,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,poet. For what does the poet mean when he calls himself the voice of
5697,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"God, but that he is intuitively aware of the eternal verities in the"
5698,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"world? Poets who speak in this way ever conceive of God as Shelley did,"
5699,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,in what is perhaps the most profoundly sincere invocation of the last
5700,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"century, his _Hymn to Intellectual Beauty_. All poets are"
5701,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,idealists.
5702,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5703,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"There is yet another view of the spirit who inspires poetry, which may"
5704,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,seem more characteristic of our poets than are these others. It
5705,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"is expressed in the opening of Shelley's _Alastor_, and informs the"
5706,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"whole of the _Ode to the West Wind_. It pervades Wordsworth, for if"
5707,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"he seldom calls upon his natural environment as muse, he is yet"
5708,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,profoundly conscious that his song is an inflowing from the heart of
5709,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,nature. This power has become such a familiar divinity to later singers
5710,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,that they are scarcely aware how great is their dependence upon her.
5711,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,There is nothing artificial or in any sense affected in the modern
5712,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"poet's conviction that in walking out to meet nature he is, in fact,"
5713,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,going to the source of poetic power. Perhaps nineteenth and twentieth
5714,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"century writers, with their trust in the power of nature to breathe song"
5715,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"into their hearts, are closer to the original faith in the muses than"
5716,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,most of the poets who have called the sisters by name during the
5717,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"intervening centuries. This deification of nature, like the other modern"
5718,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"conceptions of the spirit of song, signifies the poet's need of bringing"
5719,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"himself into harmony with the world-spirit, which moulds the otherwise"
5720,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,chaotic universe into those forms of harmony and beauty which constitute
5721,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,poetry.
5722,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5723,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Whether the poet ascribes his infilling to a specific goddess of song or
5724,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"to a mysterious harmony between his soul and the world spirit, a coming"
5725,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"""into tune with the infinite,"" as it has been called, the mode of his"
5726,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,communion is identical. There is a frenzy of desire so intolerable that
5727,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"it suddenly fails, leaving the poet in trancelike passivity while the"
5728,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"revelation is given to him,--ancient and modern writers alike describe"
5729,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"the experience thus. And modern poets, no less than ancient ones, feel"
5730,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"that, before becoming the channel of world meaning, they must be"
5731,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"deprived of their own petty, egocentric thoughts. So Keats avers of the"
5732,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"singer,"
5733,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5734,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"One hour, half-idiot, he stands by mossy waterfall;"
5735,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,The next he writes his soul's memorial.
5736,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _A Visit to Burns' Country_.]
5737,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5738,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,So Shelley describes the experience:
5739,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5740,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Meaning on his vacant mind
5741,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Flashed like strong inspiration.
5742,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _Alastor_.]
5743,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5744,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"The poet is not, he himself avers, merely thinking about things. He"
5745,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"becomes one with them. In this sense all poets are pantheists, and the"
5746,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"flash of their inspiration means the death of their personal thought,"
5747,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"enabling them, like Lucy, to be"
5748,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5749,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Rolled round in earth's diurnal course
5750,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,With rocks and stones and trees.
5751,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5752,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Hence the singer has always been called a madman. The modern writer
5753,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"cannot escape Plato's conclusion,"
5754,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5755,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,There is no invention in him (the poet) until he has been
5756,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"inspired and is out of his senses, and the mind is no longer"
5757,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,in him: when he has not attained to this state he is
5758,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,powerless and unable to utter his oracles. [Footnote:
5759,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"_Ion_, §534.]"
5760,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5761,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"And again,"
5762,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5763,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,There is a ... kind of madness which is a possession of the
5764,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Muses; this enters into a delicate and virgin soul, and"
5765,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"there inspiring frenzy, awakens lyric and all other"
5766,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"numbers.... But he who, not being inspired, and having no"
5767,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"touch of madness in his soul, comes to the door and thinks"
5768,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"he will get into the temple by the help of art, he, I say,"
5769,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,and his poetry are not admitted; the sane man is nowhere at
5770,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,all when he enters into rivalry with the madman. [Footnote:
5771,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"_Phaedrus_, § 245.]"
5772,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5773,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Even Aristotle, that sanest of philosophers, so far agrees with Plato as"
5774,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"to say,"
5775,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5776,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Poetry implies either a happy gift of nature, or a strain of"
5777,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"madness. In the one case, a man can take the mold of any"
5778,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,character; in the other he is lifted out of his proper self.
5779,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"[Footnote: _Poetics_, XVII.]"
5780,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5781,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,One must admit that poets nowadays are not always so frank as earlier
5782,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,ones in describing their state of mind. Now that the lunatic is no
5783,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"longer placed in the temple, but in the hospital, the popular imputation"
5784,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,of insanity to the poet is not always favorably received. Occasionally
5785,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,he regards it as only another unjust charge brought against him by a
5786,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,hostile world. Thus a brother poet has said that George Meredith's lot
5787,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,was
5788,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5789,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Like Lear's--for he had felt the sting
5790,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Of all too greatly giving
5791,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,The kingdom of his mind to those
5792,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Who for it deemed him mad.
5793,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"[Footnote: Cale Young Rice, _Meredith_.]"
5794,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5795,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,In so far as the world's pronouncement is based upon the oracles to
5796,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"which the poet gives utterance, he always repudiates the charge of"
5797,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"madness. Such various poets as Jean Ingelow, [Footnote: See _Gladys"
5798,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"and Her Island_.] James Thomson, B. V., [Footnote: See _Tasso to"
5799,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Leonora_.] Helen Hunt Jackson, [Footnote: See _The Singer's"
5800,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Hills_.] Alice Gary, [Footnote: See _Genius_.] and George Edward"
5801,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Woodberry, [Footnote: See _He Ate the Laurel and is Mad_.] concur"
5802,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,in the judgment that the poet is called insane by the rabble simply
5803,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,because they are blind to the ideal world in which he lives. Like the
5804,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"cave-dwellers of Plato's myth, men resent it when the seer, be he"
5805,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"prophet or philosopher, tells them that there are things more real than"
5806,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,the shadows on the wall with which they amuse themselves. Not all the
5807,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"writers just named are equally sure that they, rather than the world,"
5808,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"are right. The women are thoroughly optimistic. Mr. Woodberry, though he"
5809,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"leaves the question, whether the poet's beauty is a delusion, unanswered"
5810,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"in the poem where he broaches it, has betrayed his faith in the ideal"
5811,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"realms everywhere in his writings. James Thomson, on the contrary, is"
5812,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,not at all sure that the world is wrong in its doubt of ideal truth. The
5813,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"tone of his poem, _Tasso and Leonora_, is very gloomy. The Italian"
5814,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"poet is shown in prison, reflecting upon his faith in the ideal realms"
5815,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"where eternal beauty dwells. He muses,"
5816,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5817,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Yes--as Love is truer far
5818,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Than all other things; so are
5819,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Life and Death, the World and Time"
5820,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Mere false shows in some great Mime
5821,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,By dreadful mystery sublime.
5822,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5823,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"But at the end Tasso's faith is troubled, and he ponders,"
5824,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5825,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"For were life no flitting dream,"
5826,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Were things truly what they seem,"
5827,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Were not all this world-scene vast
5828,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,But a shade in Time's stream glassed;
5829,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Were the moods we now display
5830,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Less phantasmal than the clay
5831,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,In which our poor spirits clad
5832,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Act this vision, wild and sad,"
5833,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"I must be mad, mad,--how mad!"
5834,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5835,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"However, this is aside from the point. The average poet is as firmly"
5836,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,convinced as any philosopher that his visions are true. It is only the
5837,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,manner of his inspiration that causes him to doubt his sanity. Not
5838,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,merely is his mind vacant when the spirit of poetry is about to come
5839,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"upon him, but he is deprived of his judgment, so that he does not"
5840,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,understand his own experiences during ecstasy. The idea of verbal
5841,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"inspiration, which used to be so popular in Biblical criticism, has been"
5842,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"applied to the works of all poets. [Footnote: See _Kathrina_, by J."
5843,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"G. Holland, where the heroine maintains that the inspiration of modern"
5844,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"poets is similar to that of the Old Testament prophets, and declares,"
5845,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5846,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,As for the old seers
5847,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Whose eyes God touched with vision of the life
5848,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Of the unfolding ages, I must doubt"
5849,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Whether they comprehended what they saw.]
5850,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5851,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Such a view has been a boon to literary critics. Shakespeare
5852,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"commentators, in particular, have been duly grateful for the lee-way"
5853,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"granted them, when they are relieved from the necessity of limiting"
5854,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Shakespeare's meanings to the confines of his knowledge. As for the
5855,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"poet's own sense of his incomprehension, Francis Thompson's words are"
5856,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"typical. Addressing a little child, he wonders at the statements she"
5857,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"makes, ignorant of their significance; then he reflects,"
5858,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5859,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"And ah, we poets, I misdoubt"
5860,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Are little more than thou.
5861,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"We speak a lesson taught, we know not how,"
5862,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,And what it is that from us flows
5863,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,The hearer better than the utterer knows.
5864,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _Sister Songs._]
5865,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5866,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,One might think that the poet would take pains to differentiate this
5867,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,inspired madness from the diseased mind of the ordinary lunatic. But as
5868,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"a matter of fact, bards who were literally insane have attracted much"
5869,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,attention from their brothers. [Footnote: At the beginning of the
5870,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"romantic period not only Blake and Cowper, but Christopher Smart, John"
5871,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Clare, Thomas Dermody, John Tannahill and Thomas Lovell Beddoes made the"
5872,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"mad poet familiar.] Of these, Tasso [Footnote: See _Song for Tasso_,"
5873,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Shelley; _Tasso to Leonora_, James Thomson, B. V., _Tasso to Leonora_,"
5874,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"E. F. Hoffman.] and Cowper [Footnote: See Bowles, _The Harp and Despair"
5875,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"of Cowper_; Mrs. Browning, _Cowper's Grave_; Lord Houghton, _On Cowper's"
5876,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Cottage at Olney_.] have appeared most often in the verse of the last
5877,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,century. Cowper's inclusion among his poems of verses written during
5878,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,periods of actual insanity has seemed to indicate that poetic madness is
5879,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"not merely a figure of speech. There is also significance, as revealing"
5880,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"the poet's attitude toward insanity, in the fact that several fictional"
5881,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,poets are represented as insane. Crabbe and Shelley have ascribed
5882,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"madness to their poet-heroes, [Footnote: See Crabbe, _The Patron_;"
5883,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Shelley, _Rosalind and Helen_.] while the American, J. G. Holland,"
5884,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"represents his hero's genius as a consequence, in part, at least, of a"
5885,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"hereditary strain of suicidal insanity. [Footnote: See J. G. Holland,"
5886,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"_Kathrina_. For recent verse on the mad poet see William Rose Benét,"
5887,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"_Mad Blake_; Amy Lowell, _Clear, With Light Variable Winds_; Cale Young"
5888,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Rice, _The Mad Philosopher_; Edmund Blunden, _Clare's Ghost_.]"
5889,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5890,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"It goes without saying that this is a romantic conception, wholly"
5891,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,incompatible with the eighteenth century belief that poetry is produced
5892,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"by the action of the intelligence, aided by good taste. Think of the mad"
5893,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"poet, William Blake, assuring his sedate contemporaries,"
5894,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5895,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,All pictures that's painted with sense and with thought
5896,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Are painted by madmen as sure as a groat.
5897,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: See fragment CI.]
5898,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5899,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,What chance did he have of recognition?
5900,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5901,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,This is merely indicative of the endless quarrel between the inspired
5902,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,poet and the man of reason. The eighteenth century contempt for poetic
5903,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"madness finds typical expression in Pope's satirical lines,"
5904,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5905,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Some demon stole my pen (forgive the offense)
5906,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,And once betrayed me into common sense.
5907,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _Dunciad_.]
5908,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5909,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,And it is answered by Burns' characterization of writers depending upon
5910,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,dry reason alone:
5911,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5912,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"A set o' dull, conceited hashes"
5913,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Confuse their brains in college classes!
5914,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"They gang in sticks and come out asses,"
5915,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Plain truth to speak,"
5916,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,And syne they think to climb Parnassus
5917,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,By dint of Greek.[Footnote: _Epistle to Lapraik_.]
5918,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5919,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,The feud was perhaps at its bitterest between the eighteenth century
5920,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,classicists and such poets as Wordsworth [Footnote: See the _Prelude_.]
5921,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"and Burns, but it is by no means stilled at present. Yeats [Footnote:"
5922,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,See _The Scholar_.] and Vachel Lindsay [Footnote: See _The Master of the
5923,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Dance_. The hero is a dunce in school.] have written poetry showing the
5924,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,persistence of the quarrel. Though the acrimony of the disputants
5925,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"varies, accordingly as the tone of the poet is predominantly thoughtful"
5926,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"or emotional, one does not find any poet of the last century who denies"
5927,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,the superiority of poetic intuition to scholarship. Thus Tennyson warns
5928,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,the man of learning that he cannot hope to fathom the depths of the
5929,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,poet's mind. [Footnote: See _The Poet's Mind_.] So Richard Gilder
5930,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"maintains of the singer,"
5931,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5932,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,He was too wise
5933,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Either to fear, or follow, or despise"
5934,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Whom men call science--for he knew full well
5935,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"All she had told, or still might live to tell"
5936,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Was known to him before her very birth.
5937,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"[Footnote: _The Poet's Fame_. In the same spirit is _Invitation_, by J."
5938,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,E. Flecker.]
5939,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5940,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"The foundation of the poet's superiority is, of course, his claim that"
5941,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,his inspiration gives him mystical experience of the things which the
5942,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,scholar can only remotely speculate about. Therefore Percy Mackaye makes
5943,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Sappho vaunt over the philosopher, Pittacus:"
5944,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5945,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Yours is the living pall,"
5946,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,The aloof and frozen place of listeners
5947,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,And lookers-on at life. But mine--ah! Mine
5948,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"The fount of life itself, the burning fount"
5949,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Pierian. I pity you.
5950,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"[Footnote: _Sappho and Phaon_, a drama.]"
5951,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5952,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Very likely Pittacus had no answer to Sappho's boast, but when the"
5953,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,average nondescript verse-writer claims that his intuitions are
5954,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"infinitely superior to the results of scholarly research, the man of"
5955,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"reason is not apt to keep still. And one feels that the poet, in many"
5956,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"cases, has earned such a retort as that recorded by Young:"
5957,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5958,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,How proud the poet's billow swells!
5959,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,The God! the God! his boast:
5960,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,A boast how vain! what wrecks abound!
5961,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Dead bards stench every coast.
5962,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _Resignation_.]
5963,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5964,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,There could be no more telling blow against the poet's view of
5965,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,inspiration than this. Even so pronounced a romanticist as Mrs. Browning
5966,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,is obliged to admit that the poet cannot always trust his vision. She
5967,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,muses over the title of poet:
5968,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5969,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,The name
5970,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Is royal, and to sign it like a queen"
5971,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Is what I dare not--though some royal blood
5972,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Would seem to tingle in me now and then
5973,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"With sense of power and ache,--with imposthumes"
5974,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,And manias usual to the race. Howbeit
5975,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,I dare not: 'tis too easy to go mad
5976,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,And ape a Bourbon in a crown of straws;
5977,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,The thing's too common.
5978,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"[Footnote: _Aurora Leigh_. See also the lines in the same poem,"
5979,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"For me, I wrote"
5980,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"False poems, like the rest, and thought them true"
5981,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Because myself was true in writing them.]
5982,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5983,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Has the poet, then, no guarantee for the genuineness of his inspiration?"
5984,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Must he wait as ignorantly as his contemporaries for the judgment of
5985,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,posterity? One cannot conceive of the grandly egoistic poet saying this.
5986,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Yet the enthusiast must not believe every spirit, but try them whether"
5987,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,they be of God. What is his proof?
5988,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5989,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Emerson suggests a test, in a poem by that name. He avers,"
5990,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5991,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,I hung my verses in the wind.
5992,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Time and tide their faults may find.
5993,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,All were winnowed through and through:
5994,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Five lines lasted sound and true;
5995,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Five were smelted in a pot
5996,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Than the south more fierce and hot.
5997,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _The Test_.]
5998,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
5999,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"The last lines indicate, do they not, that the depth of the poet's"
6000,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,passion during inspiration corresponds with the judgment pronounced by
6001,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,time upon his verses? William Blake quaintly tells us that he was once
6002,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"troubled over this question of the artist's infallibility, and that on a"
6003,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"certain occasion when he was dining with the prophet Elijah, he"
6004,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"inquired, ""Does a firm belief that a thing is so make it so?"" To which"
6005,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Elijah gave the comforting reply, ""Every poet is convinced that it"
6006,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"does."" [Footnote: _The Marriage of Heaven and Hell_, ""A Memorable"
6007,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Fancy.""] To the cold critic, such an answer as Emerson's and Blake's is"
6008,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"doubtless unsatisfactory, but to the poet, as to the religious"
6009,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"enthusiast, his own ecstasy is an all-sufficient evidence."
6010,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6011,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,The thoroughgoing romanticist will accept no other test. The critic of
6012,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,the Johnsonian tradition may urge him to gauge the worth of his impulse
6013,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"by its seemliness and restraint, but the romantic poet's utter surrender"
6014,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,to a power from on high makes unrestraint seem a virtue to him. So with
6015,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,the critic's suggestion that the words coming to the poet in his season
6016,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"of madness be made to square with his returning reason. Emerson quotes,"
6017,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"and partially accepts the dictum, ""Poetry must first be good sense,"
6018,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"though it is something more."" [Footnote: See the essay on"
6019,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,_Imagination_.] But the poet is more apt to account for his belief
6020,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"in his visions by Tertullian's motto, _Credo quod absurdum_."
6021,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6022,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"If overwhelming passion is an absolute test of true inspiration, whence"
6023,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"arises the uncertainty and confusion in the poet's own mind, concerning"
6024,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,matters poetical? Why is a writer so stupid as to include one hundred
6025,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,pages of trash in the same volume with his one inspired poem? The answer
6026,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,seems to be that no writer is guided solely by inspiration. Not that he
6027,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,ever consciously falsifies or modifies the revelation given him in his
6028,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"moment of inspiration, but the revelation is ever hauntingly incomplete."
6029,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6030,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,The slightest adverse influence may jar upon the harmony between the
6031,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"poet's soul and the spirit of poetry. The stories of Dante's ""certain"
6032,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"men of business,"" who interrupted his drawing of Beatrice, and of"
6033,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Coleridge's visitors who broke in upon the writing of _Kubla Khan_,"
6034,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"are notorious. Tennyson, in _The Poet's Mind_, warns all intruders"
6035,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"away from the singer's inspired hour. He tells them,"
6036,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6037,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,In your eye there is death;
6038,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,There is frost in your breath
6039,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Which would blight the plants.
6040,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,*       *       *       *       *
6041,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,In the heart of the garden the merry bird chants;
6042,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,It would fall to the ground if you came in.
6043,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6044,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,But it is not fair always to lay the shattering of the poet's dream to
6045,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"an intruder. The poet himself cannot account for its departure, so"
6046,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"delicate and evanescent is it. Emerson says,"
6047,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6048,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,There are open hours
6049,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"When the God's will sallies free,"
6050,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,And the dull idiot might see
6051,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,The flowing fortunes of a thousand years;--
6052,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Sudden, at unawares,"
6053,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Self-moved, fly to the doors,"
6054,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Nor sword of angels could reveal
6055,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,What they conceal.
6056,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _Merlin_.]
6057,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6058,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"What is the poet, thus shut out of Paradise, to do? He can only make a"
6059,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,frenzied effort to record his vision before its very memory has faded
6060,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,from him. Benvenuto Cellini has told us of his tantrums while he was
6061,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"finishing his bronze statue of Perseus. He worked with such fury, he"
6062,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"declares, that his workmen believed him to be no man, but a devil. But"
6063,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"the poet, no less than the molder of bronze, is under the necessity of"
6064,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,casting his work into shape before the metal cools. And his success is
6065,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"never complete. Shelley writes, ""When composition begins, inspiration is"
6066,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"already on the decline, and the most glorious poetry that has ever been"
6067,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,communicated to the world is probably a feeble shadow of the original
6068,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"conceptions of the poet."" [Footnote: _The Defense of Poetry_.]"
6069,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6070,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Hence may arise the pet theory of certain modern poets, that a long poem"
6071,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,is an impossibility. Short swallow flights of song only can be wholly
6072,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"sincere, they say, for their ideal is a poem as literally spontaneous as"
6073,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Sordello's song of Elys. In proportion as work is labored, it is felt to"
6074,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,be dead.
6075,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6076,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,There is no lack of verse suggesting that extemporaneous composition is
6077,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"most poetical, [Footnote: See Scott's accounts of his minstrels'"
6078,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"composition. See also, Bayard Taylor, _Ad Amicos_, and _Proem"

6081,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Skies are Blue_; Emerson, _The Poet_; Longfellow, _Envoi_; Robert"
6082,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Bridges, _A Song of My Heart_.] but is there nothing to be said on the"
6083,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,other side? Let us reread Browning's judgment on the matter:
6084,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6085,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Touch him ne'er so lightly, into song he broke."
6086,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Soil so quick receptive,--not one feather-seed,"
6087,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Not one flower-dust fell but straight its fall awoke
6088,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Vitalizing virtue: song would song succeed
6089,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Sudden as spontaneous--prove a poet soul!
6090,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Indeed?
6091,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Rock's the song soil rather, surface hard and bare:"
6092,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Sun and dew their mildness, storm and frost their rage"
6093,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Vainly both expend,--few flowers awaken there:"
6094,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Quiet in its cleft broods--what the after-age
6095,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Knows and names a pine, a nation's heritage."
6096,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _Epilogue to the Dramatic Idyls_. The same thought is in
6097,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"the sonnet, ""I ask not for those thoughts that sudden leap,"" by James"
6098,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Russell Lowell, and _Overnight, a Rose_, by Caroline Giltiman.]"
6099,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6100,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Is it possible that the one epic poem which is a man's life work may be
6101,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,as truly inspired as is the lyric that leaps to his lips with a sudden
6102,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"gush of emotion? Or is it true, as Shelley seems to aver that such a"
6103,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"poem is never an ideal unity, but a collection of inspired lines and"
6104,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"phrases connected ""by the intertexture of conventional phrases?"""
6105,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _The Defense of Poetry_.]
6106,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6107,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,It may be that the latter view seems truer to us only because we
6108,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,misunderstand the manner in which inspiration is limited. Possibly poets
6109,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"bewail the incompleteness of the flash which is revealed to them, not"
6110,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"because they failed to see all the glories of heaven and earth, but"
6111,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"because it was a vision merely, and the key to its expression in words"
6112,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"was not given them. ""Passion and expression are beauty itself,"" says"
6113,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"William Blake, and the passion, so far from making expression inevitable"
6114,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"and spontaneous, may by its intensity be an actual handicap, putting the"
6115,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"poet into the state ""of some fierce thing replete with too much rage."""
6116,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6117,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Surely we have no right to condemn the poet because a perfect expression
6118,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"of his thought is not immediately forthcoming. Like any other artist, he"
6119,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"works with tools, and is handicapped by their inadequacy. According to"
6120,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Plato, language affords the poet a more flexible implement than any"
6121,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"other artist possesses, [Footnote: See _The Republic_, IX, 588 D.]"
6122,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"yet, at times, it appears to the maker stubborn enough. To quote Francis"
6123,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Thompson,"
6124,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6125,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Our untempered speech descends--poor heirs!
6126,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Grimy and rough-cast still from Babel's brick-layers;
6127,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Curse on the brutish jargon we inherit,"
6128,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Strong but to damn, not memorize a spirit!"
6129,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _Her Portrait_.]
6130,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6131,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Walt Whitman voices the same complaint:
6132,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6133,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Speech is the twin of my vision: it is unequal to measure itself;
6134,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"It provokes me forever; it says sarcastically,"
6135,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"""Walt, you contain enough, why don't you let it out then?"""
6136,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _Song of Myself_.]
6137,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6138,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Accordingly there is nothing more common than verse bewailing the
6139,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"singer's inarticulateness. [Footnote: See Tennyson, _In Memoriam_,"

6151,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6152,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Frequently these confessions of the impossibility of expression are
6153,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"coupled with the bitterest tirades against a stupid audience, which"
6154,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"refuses to take the poet's genius on trust, and which remains utterly"
6155,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,unmoved by his avowals that he has much to say to it that lies too deep
6156,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,for utterance. Such an outlet for the poet's very natural petulance is
6157,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,likely to seem absurd enough to us. It is surely not the fault of his
6158,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"hearers, we are inclined to tell him gently, that he suffers an"
6159,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"impediment in his speech. Yet, after all, we may be mistaken. It is"
6160,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,significant that the singers who are most aware of their
6161,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"inarticulateness are not the romanticists, who, supposedly, took no"
6162,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"thought for a possible audience; but they are the later poets, who are"
6163,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"obsessed with the idea that they have a message. Emily Dickinson,"
6164,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"herself as untroubled as any singer about her public, yet puts the"
6165,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"problem for us. She avers,"
6166,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6167,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,I found the phrase to every thought
6168,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"I ever had, but one;"
6169,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"And that defies me,--as a hand"
6170,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Did try to chalk the sun.
6171,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6172,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,To races nurtured in the dark;--
6173,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,How would your own begin?
6174,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Can blaze be done in cochineal,"
6175,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Or noon in mazarin?
6176,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6177,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"""To races nurtured in the dark."" There lies a prolific source to the"
6178,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,poet's difficulties. His task is not merely to ensure the permanence of
6179,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"his own resplendent vision, but to interpret it to men who take their"
6180,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,darkness for light. As Emerson expresses it in his translation of
6181,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Zoroaster, the poet's task is ""inscribing things unapparent in the"
6182,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"apparent fabrication of the world."" [Footnote: _Essay on Imagination_.]"
6183,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6184,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Here is the point where poets of the last one hundred years have most
6185,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,often joined issues. As writers of the eighteenth century split on the
6186,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"question whether poetry is the product of the human reason, or of a"
6187,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"divine visitation, literal ""inspiration,"" so poets of the nineteenth"
6188,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,century and of our time have been divided as to the propriety of
6189,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,adapting one's inspiration to the limitations of one's hearers. It too
6190,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,frequently happens that the poet goes to one extreme or the other. He
6191,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,may either despise his audience to such a degree that he does not
6192,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"attempt to make himself intelligible, or he may quench the spark of his"
6193,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,thought in the effort to trim his verse into a shape that pleases his
6194,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,public.
6195,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6196,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Austin Dobson takes malicious pleasure, often, in championing the less"
6197,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"aristocratic side of the controversy. His _Advice to a Poet_ follows,"
6198,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"throughout, the tenor of the first stanza:"
6199,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6200,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,My counsel to the budding bard
6201,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Is, ""Don't be long,"" and ""Don't be hard."""
6202,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Your ""gentle public,"" my good friend,"
6203,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Won't read what they can't comprehend.
6204,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6205,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"This precipitates us at once into the marts of the money changers, and"
6206,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,one shrinks back in distaste. If this is what is meant by keeping one's
6207,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"audience in mind during composition, the true poet will have none of it."
6208,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Poe's account of his deliberate composition of the _Raven_ is
6209,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,enough to estrange him from the poetic brotherhood. Yet we are face to
6210,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"face with an issue that we, as the ""gentle reader,"" cannot ignore. Shall"
6211,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"the poet, then, inshrine his visions as William Blake did, for his own"
6212,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"delight, and leave us unenlightened by his apocalypse?"
6213,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6214,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"There is a middle ground, and most poets have taken it. For in the"
6215,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"intervals of his inspiration the poet himself becomes, as has been"
6216,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"reiterated, a mere man, and except for the memories of happier moments"
6217,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"that abide with him, he is as dull as his reader. So when he labors to"
6218,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,make his inspiration articulate he is not coldly manipulating his
6219,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"materials, like a pedagogue endeavoring to drive home a lesson, but for"
6220,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,his own future delight he is making the spirit of beauty incarnate. And
6221,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"he will spare no pains to this end. Keats cries,"
6222,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6223,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"O for ten years, that I may overwhelm"
6224,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Myself in poesy; so I may do the deed
6225,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,My soul has to herself decreed.

6229,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Bryant warns the poet,"
6230,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6231,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Deem not the framing of a deathless lay
6232,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,The pastime of a drowsy summer day;
6233,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,But gather all thy powers
6234,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,And wreak them on the verse that thou dost weave.
6235,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _The Poet_.]
6236,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6237,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,It is true that not all poets agree that these years of labor are of
6238,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"avail. Even Bryant, just quoted, warns the poet,"
6239,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6240,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Touch the crude line with fear
6241,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,But in the moments of impassioned thought.
6242,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _The Poet_.]
6243,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6244,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Indeed the singer's awe of the mysterious revelation given him may be so
6245,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,deep that he dares not tamper with his first impetuous transcription of
6246,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"it. But as a sculptor toils over a single vein till it is perfect, the"
6247,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"poet may linger over a word or phrase, and so long as the pulse seems to"
6248,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"beat beneath his fingers, no one has a right to accuse him of"
6249,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"artificiality. Sometimes, indeed, he is awkward, and when he tries to"
6250,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"wreathe his thoughts together, they wither like field flowers under his"
6251,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"hot touch. Or, in his zeal, he may fashion for his forms an embroidered"
6252,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,robe of such richness that like heavy brocade it disguises the form
6253,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"which it should express. In fact, poets are apt to have an affection,"
6254,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"not merely for their inspiration, but for the words that clothe it."
6255,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Keats confessed, ""I look upon fine phrases as a lover."" Tennyson"
6256,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"delighted in ""jewels fine words long, that on the stretched forefinger"
6257,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"of all time sparkle forever."" Rossetti spoke no less sincerely than"
6258,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"these others, no doubt, even though he did not illustrate the efficacy"
6259,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"of his search, when he described his interest in reading old manuscripts"
6260,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"with the hope of ""pitching on some stunning words for poetry."" Ever and"
6261,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,anon there is a rebellion against conscious elaboration in dressing
6262,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,one's thoughts. We are just emerging from one of the noisiest of these.
6263,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,The vers-librists insist that all adornment and disguise be stripped
6264,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"off, and the idea be exhibited in its naked simplicity. The quarrel with"
6265,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"more conservative writers comes, not from any disagreement as to the"
6266,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"beauty of ideas in the nude, but from a doubt on the part of the"
6267,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,conservatives as to whether one can capture ideal beauty without an
6268,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,accurately woven net of words. Nor do the vers-librists prove that they
6269,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"are less concerned with form than are other poets. ""The poet must learn"
6270,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"his trade in the same manner, and with the same painstaking care, as the"
6271,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"cabinet maker,"" says Amy Lowell. [Footnote: Preface to _Sword Blades"
6272,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,and Poppy Seed_.] The disagreement among poets on this point is
6273,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,proving itself to be not so great as some had supposed. The ideal of
6274,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"most singers, did they possess the secret, is to do as Mrs. Browning"
6275,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"advises them,"
6276,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6277,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Keep up the fire
6278,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,And leave the generous flames to shape themselves.
6279,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _Aurora Leigh_.]
6280,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6281,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Whether the poet toils for years to form a shrine for his thought, or"
6282,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,whether his awe forbids him to touch his first unconscious formulation
6283,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"of it, there comes a time when all that he can do has been done, and he"
6284,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,realizes that he will never approximate his vision more closely than
6285,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"this. Then, indeed, as high as was his rapture during the moment of"
6286,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"revelation, so deep is likely to be his discouragement with his powers"
6287,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"of creation, for, however fair he may feel his poem to be, it yet does"
6288,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,not fill the place of what he has lost. Thus Francis Thompson sighs over
6289,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"the poet,"
6290,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6291,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"When the embrace has failed, the rapture fled,"
6292,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Not he, not he, the wild sweet witch is dead,"
6293,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,And though he cherisheth
6294,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"The babe most strangely born from out her death,"
6295,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"Some tender trick of her it hath, maybe,"
6296,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,It is not she.
6297,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,[Footnote: _Sister Songs_.]
6298,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6299,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"We have called the poet an egotist, and surely, his attitude toward the"
6300,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"blind rout who have had no glimpse of the heavenly vision, is one of"
6301,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"contemptuous superiority. But like the priest in the temple, all his"
6302,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"arrogance vanishes when he ceases to harangue the congregation, and goes"
6303,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,into the secret place to worship. And toward anyone who sincerely seeks
6304,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,"the revelation, no matter how feeble his powers may be, the poet's"
6305,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,attitude is one of tenderest sympathy and comradeship. Alice Gary

6307,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,
6308,THE SPARK FROM HEAVEN,Hear me tell

6350,THE POET'S MORALITY,If English poets of the last century are more inclined to parade their

6352,THE POET'S MORALITY,of a singular persistency on the part of England in searching out and
6353,THE POET'S MORALITY,punishing sins ascribed to poetic temperament. Byron was banished;
6354,THE POET'S MORALITY,Shelley was judged unfit to rear his own children; Keats was advertised
6355,THE POET'S MORALITY,"as an example of ""extreme moral depravity""; [Footnote: By _Blackwoods_.]"
6356,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Oscar Wilde was imprisoned; Swinburne was castigated as ""an unclean"
6357,THE POET'S MORALITY,"fiery imp from the pit."" [Footnote: By _The Saturday Review_.] These are"
6358,THE POET'S MORALITY,some of the most conspicuous examples of a refusal by the British public
6359,THE POET'S MORALITY,to countenance what it considers a code of morals peculiar to poets. It
6360,THE POET'S MORALITY,is hardly to be wondered at that verse-writers of the nineteenth and
6361,THE POET'S MORALITY,twentieth centuries have not been inclined to quarrel with Sir Philip
6362,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Sidney's statement that ""England is the stepmother of poets,"" [Footnote:"

6365,THE POET'S MORALITY,failings ruthlessly out to the light.
6366,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6367,THE POET'S MORALITY,"It cannot, however, be maintained that England is unique in her"
6368,THE POET'S MORALITY,prejudice against poetic morals. The charges against the artist have
6369,THE POET'S MORALITY,"been long in existence, and have been formulated and reformulated in"
6370,THE POET'S MORALITY,"many countries. In fact Greece, rather than England, might with some"
6371,THE POET'S MORALITY,"justice be regarded as the parent of the poet's maligners, for Plato has"
6372,THE POET'S MORALITY,been largely responsible for the hue and cry against the poet throughout

6378,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6379,THE POET'S MORALITY,Though the accusers of the poet are agreed that the predominance of
6380,THE POET'S MORALITY,"passion in his nature is the cause of his depravity, still they are a"
6381,THE POET'S MORALITY,"heterogeneous company, suffering the most violent disagreement among"
6382,THE POET'S MORALITY,themselves as to a valid reason for pronouncing his passionate impulses
6383,THE POET'S MORALITY,criminal. Their unfortunate victim is beset from so many directions that
6384,THE POET'S MORALITY,he is sorely put to it to defend himself against one band of assailants
6385,THE POET'S MORALITY,without exposing himself to attack from another quarter.
6386,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6387,THE POET'S MORALITY,"This hostile public may be roughly divided into three camps, made up,"
6388,THE POET'S MORALITY,"respectively, of philistines, philosophers, and puritans. Within recent"
6389,THE POET'S MORALITY,years the distinct grievance of each group has been made articulate in a
6390,THE POET'S MORALITY,formal denunciation of the artist's morals.
6391,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6392,THE POET'S MORALITY,"There is, first, that notorious indictment, _Degeneration_, by Max"
6393,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Nordau. Nordau speaks eloquently for all who claim the name ""average"
6394,THE POET'S MORALITY,"plain citizen,"" all who would hustle off to the gallows anyone found"
6395,THE POET'S MORALITY,guilty of breaking the lockstep imposed upon men by convention.
6396,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Secondly, there is a severe criticism of the poet from an ostensibly"
6397,THE POET'S MORALITY,"unbiased point of view, _The Man of Genius_, by Césare Lombroso."
6398,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Herein are presented the arguments of the thinkers, who probe the poet's"
6399,THE POET'S MORALITY,"foibles with an impersonal and scientific curiosity. Last, there is the"
6400,THE POET'S MORALITY,"severe arraignment, _What Is Art?_ by Tolstoi. In this book are"
6401,THE POET'S MORALITY,"crystallized the convictions of the ascetics, who recognize in beauty a"
6402,THE POET'S MORALITY,"false goddess, luring men from the stern pursuit of holiness."
6403,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6404,THE POET'S MORALITY,"How does it come about that, in affirming the perniciousness of the"
6405,THE POET'S MORALITY,"poet's passionate temperament, the man of the street, the philosopher,"
6406,THE POET'S MORALITY,and the puritan are for the nonce in agreement? The man of the street is
6407,THE POET'S MORALITY,"not averse to feeling, as a rule, even when it is carried to egregious"
6408,THE POET'S MORALITY,lengths of sentimentality. A stroll through a village when all the
6409,THE POET'S MORALITY,victrolas are in operation would settle this point unequivocally for any
6410,THE POET'S MORALITY,doubter. It seems that the philistine's quarrel with the poet arises
6411,THE POET'S MORALITY,"from the fact that, unlike the makers of phonograph records, the poet"
6412,THE POET'S MORALITY,dares to follow feeling in defiance of public sentiment. Like the
6413,THE POET'S MORALITY,"conservative that he is, the philistine gloats over the poet's lapses"
6414,THE POET'S MORALITY,"from virtue because, in setting aside mass-feeling as a gauge of right"
6415,THE POET'S MORALITY,"and wrong, and in setting up, instead, his own individual feelings as a"
6416,THE POET'S MORALITY,"rule of conduct, the poet displays an arrogance that deserves a fall."
6417,THE POET'S MORALITY,"The philosopher, like the philistine, may tolerate feeling within"
6418,THE POET'S MORALITY,"limits. His sole objection to the poet lies in the fact that, far from"
6419,THE POET'S MORALITY,"making emotion the handmaiden of the reason, as the philosopher would"
6420,THE POET'S MORALITY,"do, the poet exalts emotion to a seat above the reason, thus making"
6421,THE POET'S MORALITY,"feeling the supreme arbiter of conduct. The puritan, of course, gives"
6422,THE POET'S MORALITY,"vent to the most bitter hostility of all, for, unlike the philistine and"
6423,THE POET'S MORALITY,"the philosopher, he regards natural feeling as wholly corrupt. Therefore"
6424,THE POET'S MORALITY,he condemns the poet's indulgence of his passionate nature with equal
6425,THE POET'S MORALITY,severity whether he is within or without the popular confines of proper
6426,THE POET'S MORALITY,"conduct, or whether or not his conduct may be proved reasonable."
6427,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6428,THE POET'S MORALITY,Much of the inconsistency in the poet's exhibitions of his moral
6429,THE POET'S MORALITY,"character may be traced to the fact that he is addressing now one, now"
6430,THE POET'S MORALITY,"another, of his accusers. The sobriety of his arguments with the"
6431,THE POET'S MORALITY,philosopher has sometimes been interpreted by the man of the street as
6432,THE POET'S MORALITY,"cowardly side-stepping. On the other hand, the poet's bravado in defying"
6433,THE POET'S MORALITY,the man of the street might be interpreted by the philosopher as an
6434,THE POET'S MORALITY,acknowledgment of imperviousness to reason.
6435,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6436,THE POET'S MORALITY,It seems as though the first impulse of the poet were to set his back
6437,THE POET'S MORALITY,"against the wall and deal with all his antagonists at once, by"
6438,THE POET'S MORALITY,challenging their right to pry into his private conduct. It is true that
6439,THE POET'S MORALITY,certain poets of the last century have believed it beneath their dignity
6440,THE POET'S MORALITY,to pay any attention to the insults and persecution of the public. But
6441,THE POET'S MORALITY,though a number have maintained an air of stolid indifference so long as
6442,THE POET'S MORALITY,"the attacks have remained personal, few or none have been content to"
6443,THE POET'S MORALITY,disregard defamation of a departed singer.
6444,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6445,THE POET'S MORALITY,"The public cannot maintain, in many instances, that this vicarious"
6446,THE POET'S MORALITY,indignation arises from a sense of sharing the frailties of the dead
6447,THE POET'S MORALITY,poet who is the direct object of attack. Not thus may one account for
6448,THE POET'S MORALITY,"the generous heat of Whittier, of Richard Watson Gilder, of Robert"
6449,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Browning, of Tennyson, in rebuking the public which itches to make a"
6450,THE POET'S MORALITY,posthumous investigation of a singer's character. [Footnote: See
6451,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Whittier, _My Namesake_; Richard W. Gilder, _A Poet's Protest_, and"
6452,THE POET'S MORALITY,"_Desecration_; Robert Browning, _House_; Tennyson, _In Memoriam_.]"
6453,THE POET'S MORALITY,Tennyson affords a most interesting example of sensitiveness with
6454,THE POET'S MORALITY,"nothing, apparently, to conceal. There are many anecdotes of his morbid"
6455,THE POET'S MORALITY,"shrinking from public curiosity, wholly in key with his cry of"
6456,THE POET'S MORALITY,"abhorrence,"
6457,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6458,THE POET'S MORALITY,Now the poet cannot die
6459,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Nor leave his music as of old,"
6460,THE POET'S MORALITY,But round him ere he scarce be cold
6461,THE POET'S MORALITY,Begins the scandal and the cry:
6462,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Proclaim the faults he would not show,"
6463,THE POET'S MORALITY,Break lock and seal; betray the trust;
6464,THE POET'S MORALITY,Keep nothing sacred; 'tis but just
6465,THE POET'S MORALITY,The many-headed beast should know.
6466,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6467,THE POET'S MORALITY,"In protesting against the right of the public to judge their conduct,"
6468,THE POET'S MORALITY,true poets refuse to bring themselves to a level with their accusers by
6469,THE POET'S MORALITY,"making the easiest retort, that they are made of exactly the same clay"
6470,THE POET'S MORALITY,as is the _hoi polloi_ that assails them. This sort of recrimination is
6471,THE POET'S MORALITY,characteristic of a certain blustering type of claimant for the title of
6472,THE POET'S MORALITY,"poet, such as Joaquin Miller, a rather disorderly American of the last"
6473,THE POET'S MORALITY,"generation, who dismissed attacks upon the singer with the words,"
6474,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6475,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Yea, he hath sinned. Who hath revealed"
6476,THE POET'S MORALITY,That he was more than man or less?
6477,THE POET'S MORALITY,[Footnote: _Burns_ and _Byron_.]
6478,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6479,THE POET'S MORALITY,The attitude is also characteristic of another anomalous type which
6480,THE POET'S MORALITY,"flourished in America fifty years ago, whose verse represents an"
6481,THE POET'S MORALITY,attempted fusion of emasculated poetry and philistine piety. A writer of
6482,THE POET'S MORALITY,"this type moralizes impartially over the erring bard and his accusers,"
6483,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6484,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Sin met thy brother everywhere,"
6485,THE POET'S MORALITY,And is thy brother blamed?
6486,THE POET'S MORALITY,"From passion, danger, doubt and care"
6487,THE POET'S MORALITY,He no exemption claimed.
6488,THE POET'S MORALITY,"[Footnote: Ebenezer Eliot, _Burns_.]"
6489,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6490,THE POET'S MORALITY,But genuine poets refuse to compromise themselves by admitting that they
6491,THE POET'S MORALITY,are no better than other men.
6492,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6493,THE POET'S MORALITY,"They are not averse, however, to pointing out the unfitness of the"
6494,THE POET'S MORALITY,public to cast the first stone. So unimpeachable a citizen as Longfellow
6495,THE POET'S MORALITY,"finds even in the notoriously spotted artist, Benvenuto Cellini, an"
6496,THE POET'S MORALITY,advantage over his maligners because
6497,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6498,THE POET'S MORALITY,He is not
6499,THE POET'S MORALITY,"That despicable thing, a hypocrite."
6500,THE POET'S MORALITY,[Footnote: _Michael Angelo_.]
6501,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6502,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Most of the faults charged to them, poets aver, exist solely in the evil"
6503,THE POET'S MORALITY,minds of their critics. Coleridge goes so far as to expurgate the poetry
6504,THE POET'S MORALITY,"of William Blake, ""not for the want of innocence in the poem, but from"
6505,THE POET'S MORALITY,"the too probable want of it in the readers."" [Footnote: Letter to Charles"
6506,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Augustus Tulk, Highgate, Thursday Evening, 1818, p. 684, Vol. II,"
6507,THE POET'S MORALITY,"_Letters_, ed. E. Hartley Coleridge.]"
6508,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6509,THE POET'S MORALITY,"The nakedness of any frailties which poets may possess, makes it the"
6510,THE POET'S MORALITY,"more contemptible, they feel, for the public to wrap itself in the cloak"
6511,THE POET'S MORALITY,of hypocrisy before casting stones. The modern poet's weakness for
6512,THE POET'S MORALITY,autobiographical revelation leaves no secret corners in his nature in
6513,THE POET'S MORALITY,which surreptitious vices may lurk. One might generalize what Keats says
6514,THE POET'S MORALITY,"of Burns, ""We can see horribly clear in the work of such a man his whole"
6515,THE POET'S MORALITY,"life, as if we were God's spies."" [Footnote: Sidney Colvin, _John Keats_,"
6516,THE POET'S MORALITY,p. 285.] The Rousseau-like nudity of the poet's soul is sometimes put
6517,THE POET'S MORALITY,forward as a plea that the public should close its eyes to possible
6518,THE POET'S MORALITY,"shortcomings. Yet, as a matter of fact, it is precisely in the lack of"
6519,THE POET'S MORALITY,privacy characterizing the poet's life that his enemies find their
6520,THE POET'S MORALITY,justification for concerning themselves with his morality. Since by
6521,THE POET'S MORALITY,flaunting his personality in his verse he propagates his faults among
6522,THE POET'S MORALITY,"his admirers, the public is surely justified in pointing out and"
6523,THE POET'S MORALITY,denouncing his failings.
6524,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6525,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Poets cannot logically deny this. To do so, they would have to confess"
6526,THE POET'S MORALITY,that their inspirations are wholly unaffected by their personalities.
6527,THE POET'S MORALITY,"But this is, naturally, a very unpopular line of defense. That unhappy"
6528,THE POET'S MORALITY,"worshiper of puritan morals and of the muses, J. G. Holland, does make"
6529,THE POET'S MORALITY,"such a contention, averring,"
6530,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6531,THE POET'S MORALITY,God finds his mighty way
6532,THE POET'S MORALITY,Into his verse. The dimmest window panes
6533,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Let in the morning light, and in that light"
6534,THE POET'S MORALITY,Our faces shine with kindled sense of God
6535,THE POET'S MORALITY,"And his unwearied goodness, but the glass"
6536,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Gets little good of it; nay, it retains"
6537,THE POET'S MORALITY,Its chill and grime beyond the power of light
6538,THE POET'S MORALITY,To warm or whiten ...
6539,THE POET'S MORALITY,... The psalmist's soul
6540,THE POET'S MORALITY,Was not a fitting place for psalms like his
6541,THE POET'S MORALITY,"To dwell in overlong, while wanting words."
6542,THE POET'S MORALITY,[Footnote: _Kathrina._]
6543,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6544,THE POET'S MORALITY,But the egotism of the average poet precludes this explanation. No more
6545,THE POET'S MORALITY,deadly insult could be offered him than forgiveness of his sins on the
6546,THE POET'S MORALITY,ground of their unimportance. Far from holding that his personality does
6547,THE POET'S MORALITY,"not affect his verse, he would have us believe that the sole worth of"
6548,THE POET'S MORALITY,his poetry lies in its reflection of his unique qualities of soul.
6549,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Elizabeth Barrett, not Holland, exhibits the typical poetic attitude"
6550,THE POET'S MORALITY,"when she asks Robert Browning, ""Is it true, as others say, that the"
6551,THE POET'S MORALITY,"productions of an artist do not partake of his real nature,--that in the"
6552,THE POET'S MORALITY,"minor sense, man is not made in the image of God? It is _not_ true,"
6553,THE POET'S MORALITY,"to my mind."" [Footnote: Letter to Robert Browning, February 3, 1845.]"
6554,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6555,THE POET'S MORALITY,The glass houses in which the poet's accusers may reside really have
6556,THE POET'S MORALITY,nothing to do with the question. The immorality of these men is of
6557,THE POET'S MORALITY,"comparatively slight significance, whereas the importance of the poet's"
6558,THE POET'S MORALITY,"personality is enormous, because it takes on immortality through his"
6559,THE POET'S MORALITY,"works. Not his contemporaries alone, but readers of his verse yet unborn"
6560,THE POET'S MORALITY,have a right to call him to account for his faults. Though Swinburne
6561,THE POET'S MORALITY,"muses happily over the sins of Villon,"
6562,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6563,THE POET'S MORALITY,"But from thy feet now death hath washed the mire,"
6564,THE POET'S MORALITY,[Footnote: _A Ballad of François Villon._]
6565,THE POET'S MORALITY,it is difficult to see how he could seriously have advanced such a
6566,THE POET'S MORALITY,"claim, inasmuch as, assuming Villon's sincerity, the reader, without"
6567,THE POET'S MORALITY,"recourse to a biography, may reconstruct the whole course of his moral"
6568,THE POET'S MORALITY,history from his writings.
6569,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6570,THE POET'S MORALITY,Unquestionably if the poet wishes to satisfy his enemies as to the
6571,THE POET'S MORALITY,"ethical worth of his poetry, he is under obligation to prove to them"
6572,THE POET'S MORALITY,"that as ""the man of feeling"" he possesses only those impulses that lead"
6573,THE POET'S MORALITY,"him toward righteousness. And though puritans, philosophers and"
6574,THE POET'S MORALITY,philistines quarrel over technical points in their conceptions of
6575,THE POET'S MORALITY,"virtue, still, if the poet is not a criminal, he should be able, by"
6576,THE POET'S MORALITY,"making a plain statement of his innocence, to remove the most heinous"
6577,THE POET'S MORALITY,"charges against him, which bind his enemies into a coalition."
6578,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6579,THE POET'S MORALITY,"There is no doubt that poets, as a class, have acknowledged the"
6580,THE POET'S MORALITY,obligation of proving that their lives are pure. But the effectiveness
6581,THE POET'S MORALITY,of their statements has been largely dissipated by the fact that their
6582,THE POET'S MORALITY,voices have been almost drowned by the clamor of a small coterie which
6583,THE POET'S MORALITY,finds its chief delight in brazenly exaggerating the vices popularly
6584,THE POET'S MORALITY,"ascribed to it, then defending them as the poet's exclusive privilege."
6585,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6586,THE POET'S MORALITY,"So perennially does this group flourish, and so shrill-voiced are its"
6587,THE POET'S MORALITY,"members in self-advertisement, that it is useless for other poets to"
6588,THE POET'S MORALITY,"present their case, till the claims of the ostentatiously wicked are"
6589,THE POET'S MORALITY,"heard. One is inclined, perhaps, to dismiss them as pseudo-poets, whose"
6590,THE POET'S MORALITY,only chance at notoriety is through enunciating paradoxes. In these days
6591,THE POET'S MORALITY,"when the school has shrunk to Ezra Pound and his followers, vaunting"
6592,THE POET'S MORALITY,"their superiority to the public, ""whose virgin stupidity is"
6593,THE POET'S MORALITY,"untemptable,"" [Footnote: Ezra Pound, _Tensone._] it is easy to"
6594,THE POET'S MORALITY,dismiss the men and their verse thus lightly. But what is one to say
6595,THE POET'S MORALITY,"when one encounters the decadent school in the last century, flourishing"
6596,THE POET'S MORALITY,"at a time when, in the words of George Augustus Scala, the public had to"
6597,THE POET'S MORALITY,"choose between ""the clever (but I cannot say moral) Mr. Swinburne, and"
6598,THE POET'S MORALITY,"the moral (but I cannot say clever) Mr. Tupper?"" [Footnote: See E."
6599,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Gosse, _Life of Swinburne,_ p. 162.] What is one to say of a period"
6600,THE POET'S MORALITY,"wherein the figure of Byron, with his bravado and contempt for accepted"
6601,THE POET'S MORALITY,"morality, towers above most of his contemporaries?"
6602,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6603,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Whatever its justification, the excuse for the poets flaunting an"
6604,THE POET'S MORALITY,addiction to immorality lies in the obnoxiousness of the philistine
6605,THE POET'S MORALITY,"element among their enemies. When mass feeling, mass-morality, becomes"
6606,THE POET'S MORALITY,"too oppressive, poets are wont to escape from its trammelling"
6607,THE POET'S MORALITY,conventions at any cost. Rather than consent to lay their emotions under
6608,THE POET'S MORALITY,"the rubber-stamp of expediency, they are likely to aver, with the"
6609,THE POET'S MORALITY,"sophists of old, that morality is for slaves, whereas the rulers among"
6610,THE POET'S MORALITY,"men, the poets, recognize no law but natural law."
6611,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6612,THE POET'S MORALITY,Swinburne affords an excellent example of this type of reaction. Looking
6613,THE POET'S MORALITY,back tolerantly upon his early prayers to the pagan ideal to
6614,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6615,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Come down and redeem us from virtue,"
6616,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6617,THE POET'S MORALITY,upon his youthful zest in leaving
6618,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6619,THE POET'S MORALITY,The lilies and languors of virtue
6620,THE POET'S MORALITY,"For the roses and raptures of vice,"
6621,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6622,THE POET'S MORALITY,"he tried to dissect his motives. ""I had,"" he said, ""a touch of Byronic"
6623,THE POET'S MORALITY,ambition to be thought an eminent and terrible enemy to the decorous
6624,THE POET'S MORALITY,"life and respectable fashion of the world, and, as in Byron's case,"
6625,THE POET'S MORALITY,there was mingled with a sincere scorn and horror of hypocrisy a boyish
6626,THE POET'S MORALITY,"and voluble affectation of audacity and excess."" [Footnote: E. Gosse,"
6627,THE POET'S MORALITY,"_Life of Swinburne,_ p. 309.]"
6628,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6629,THE POET'S MORALITY,"So far, so good. There is little cause for disagreement among poets,"
6630,THE POET'S MORALITY,"however respectable or the reverse their own lives may be, in the"
6631,THE POET'S MORALITY,contention that the first step toward sincerity of artistic expression
6632,THE POET'S MORALITY,must be the casting off of external restraints. Even the most
6633,THE POET'S MORALITY,"conservative of them is not likely to be seriously concerned if, for the"
6634,THE POET'S MORALITY,"time being, he finds among the younger generation a certain exaggeration"
6635,THE POET'S MORALITY,of the pose of unrestraint. The respectability of Oliver Wendell Holmes
6636,THE POET'S MORALITY,did not prevent his complacent musing over Tom Moore:
6637,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6638,THE POET'S MORALITY,If on his cheek unholy blood
6639,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Burned for one youthful hour,"
6640,THE POET'S MORALITY,'Twas but the flushing of the bud
6641,THE POET'S MORALITY,That bloomed a milk-white flower.
6642,THE POET'S MORALITY,[Footnote: _After a Lecture on Moore_.]
6643,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6644,THE POET'S MORALITY,One may lay it down as an axiom among poets that their ethical natures
6645,THE POET'S MORALITY,"must develop spontaneously, or not at all. An attempt to force one's"
6646,THE POET'S MORALITY,moral instincts will inevitably cramp and thwart one's art. It is
6647,THE POET'S MORALITY,"unparalleled to find so great a poet as Coleridge plaintively asserting,"
6648,THE POET'S MORALITY,"""I have endeavored to feel what I ought to feel,"" [Footnote: Letter to"
6649,THE POET'S MORALITY,"the Reverend George Coleridge, March 21, 1794.] and his brothers have"
6650,THE POET'S MORALITY,"recoiled from his words. His declaration was, of course, not equivalent"
6651,THE POET'S MORALITY,"to saying, ""I have endeavored to feel what the world thinks I ought to"
6652,THE POET'S MORALITY,"feel,"" but even so, one suspects that the philosophical part of"
6653,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Coleridge was uppermost at the time of this utterance, and that his"
6654,THE POET'S MORALITY,obligatory feelings did not flower in a _Christabel_ or a _Kubla Khan_.
6655,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6656,THE POET'S MORALITY,The real parting of the ways between the major and minor contingents of
6657,THE POET'S MORALITY,"poets comes when certain writers maintain, not merely their freedom from"
6658,THE POET'S MORALITY,"conventional moral standards, but a perverse inclination to seek what"
6659,THE POET'S MORALITY,"even they regard as evil. This is, presumably, a logical, if"
6660,THE POET'S MORALITY,"unconscious, outgrowth of the romantic conception of art as ""strangeness"
6661,THE POET'S MORALITY,"added to beauty."" For the decadents conceive that the loveliness of"
6662,THE POET'S MORALITY,virtue is an age-worn theme which has grown so obvious as to lose its
6663,THE POET'S MORALITY,"æsthetic appeal, whereas the manifold variety of vice contains"
6664,THE POET'S MORALITY,"unexplored possibilities of fresh, exotic beauty. Hence there has been"
6665,THE POET'S MORALITY,"on their part an ardent pursuit of hitherto undreamed-of sins, whose"
6666,THE POET'S MORALITY,aura of suggestiveness has not been rubbed off by previous artistic
6667,THE POET'S MORALITY,expression.
6668,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6669,THE POET'S MORALITY,The decadent's excuse for his vices is that his office is to reflect
6670,THE POET'S MORALITY,"life, and that indulgence of the senses quickens his apprehension of it."
6671,THE POET'S MORALITY,"He is apt to represent the artist as ""a martyr for all mundane moods to"
6672,THE POET'S MORALITY,"tear,"" [Footnote: See John Davidson, A Ballad in Blank Verse.] and to"
6673,THE POET'S MORALITY,indicate that he is unable to see life steadily and see it whole until
6674,THE POET'S MORALITY,"he has experienced the whole gamut of crime.[Footnote: See Oscar Wilde,"
6675,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Ravenna; John Davidson, A Ballad in Blank Verse on the Making of a Poet,"
6676,THE POET'S MORALITY,"A Ballad of an Artist's Wife; Arthur Symons, There's No Lust Like to"
6677,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Poetry.] Such a view has not, of course, been confined to the nineteenth"
6678,THE POET'S MORALITY,century. A characteristic renaissance attitude toward life and art was
6679,THE POET'S MORALITY,"caught by Browning in a passage of _Sordello_. The hero, in a momentary"
6680,THE POET'S MORALITY,"reaction from idealism, longs for the keener sensations arising from"
6681,THE POET'S MORALITY,"vice and exclaims,"
6682,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6683,THE POET'S MORALITY,Leave untried
6684,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Virtue, the creaming honey-wine; quick squeeze"
6685,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Vice, like a biting serpent, from the lees"
6686,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Of life! Together let wrath, hatred, lust,"
6687,THE POET'S MORALITY,All tyrannies in every shape be thrust
6688,THE POET'S MORALITY,Upon this now.
6689,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6690,THE POET'S MORALITY,Naturally Browning does not allow this thirst for evil to be more than a
6691,THE POET'S MORALITY,passing impulse in Sordello's life.
6692,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6693,THE POET'S MORALITY,The weakness of this recipe for poetic achievement stands revealed in
6694,THE POET'S MORALITY,the cynicism with which expositions of the frankly immoral poet end. If
6695,THE POET'S MORALITY,"the quest of wickedness is a powerful stimulus to the emotions, it is a"
6696,THE POET'S MORALITY,very short-lived one. The blasé note is so dominant in Byron's
6697,THE POET'S MORALITY,"autobiographical poetry,--the lyrics, _Childe Harold_ and _Don"
6698,THE POET'S MORALITY,Juan_--as to render quotation tiresome. It sounds no less inevitably
6699,THE POET'S MORALITY,in the decadent verse at the other end of the century. Ernest Dowson's
6700,THE POET'S MORALITY,_Villanelle of the Poet's Road_ is a typical expression of the
6701,THE POET'S MORALITY,"mood. Dowson's biography leaves no doubt of the sincerity of his lines,"
6702,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6703,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Wine and women and song,"
6704,THE POET'S MORALITY,Three things garnish our way:
6705,THE POET'S MORALITY,Yet is day overlong.
6706,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Three things render us strong,"
6707,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Vine-leaves, kisses and bay."
6708,THE POET'S MORALITY,Yet is day overlong.
6709,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Since the decadents themselves must admit that delight in sin kills,"
6710,THE POET'S MORALITY,"rather than nurtures, sensibility, a popular defense of their practices"
6711,THE POET'S MORALITY,"is to the effect that sin, far from being sought consciously, is an"
6712,THE POET'S MORALITY,inescapable result of the artist's abandonment to his feelings. Moreover
6713,THE POET'S MORALITY,"it is useful, they assert, in stirring up remorse, a very poetic"
6714,THE POET'S MORALITY,"feeling, because it heightens one's sense of the beauty of holiness."
6715,THE POET'S MORALITY,This view attained to considerable popularity during the Victorian
6716,THE POET'S MORALITY,"period, when sentimental piety and worship of Byron were sorely put to"
6717,THE POET'S MORALITY,it to exist side by side. The prevalence of the view that remorse is the
6718,THE POET'S MORALITY,most reliable poetic stimulant is given amusing evidence in the
6719,THE POET'S MORALITY,_Juvenalia_ of Tennyson [Footnote: See _Poems of Two Brothers_.]and
6720,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Clough, [Footnote: See _An Evening Walk in Spring_.] wherein these"
6721,THE POET'S MORALITY,"youths of sixteen and seventeen, whose later lives were to prove so"
6722,THE POET'S MORALITY,"innocuous, represent themselves as racked with the pangs of repentance"
6723,THE POET'S MORALITY,"for mysteriously awful crimes. Mrs. Browning, an excellent recorder of"
6724,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Victorian public opinion, ascribed a belief in the deplorable but"
6725,THE POET'S MORALITY,"inevitable conjunction of crime and poetry to her literary friends, Miss"
6726,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Mitford and Mrs. Jameson. Their doctrine, Mrs. Browning wrote, ""is that"
6727,THE POET'S MORALITY,everything put into the poetry is taken out of the man and lost utterly
6728,THE POET'S MORALITY,"by him."" [Footnote: See letters to Robert Browning, February 17, 1846;"
6729,THE POET'S MORALITY,"May 1,1846.] Naturally, Mrs. Browning wholly repudiated the idea, and"
6730,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Browning concurred in her judgment. ""What is crime,"" he asked, ""which"
6731,THE POET'S MORALITY,"would have been prevented but for the 'genius' involved in it?--Poor,"
6732,THE POET'S MORALITY,"cowardly, miscreated creatures abound--if you could throw genius into"

6735,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6736,THE POET'S MORALITY,Burns has been the great precedent for verse depicting the poet as
6737,THE POET'S MORALITY,"yearning for holiness, even while his importunate passions force him"
6738,THE POET'S MORALITY,"into evil courses. One must admit that in the verse of Burns himself, a"
6739,THE POET'S MORALITY,"yearning for virtue is not always obvious, for he seems at times to take"
6740,THE POET'S MORALITY,"an unholy delight in contemplating his own failings, as witness the"
6741,THE POET'S MORALITY,"_Epistle to Lapraik_, and his repentance seems merely perfunctory,"
6742,THE POET'S MORALITY,"as in the lines,"
6743,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6744,THE POET'S MORALITY,"There's ae wee faut they whiles lay to me,"

6757,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6758,THE POET'S MORALITY,Sympathy for the well-meaning but misguided singer reached its height
6759,THE POET'S MORALITY,"about twenty years ago, when new discoveries about Villon threw a glamor"
6760,THE POET'S MORALITY,"over the poet of checkered life. [Footnote: See Edwin Markham, _Villon_;"
6761,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Swinburne, _Burns_, _A Ballad of François Villon_.] At the same time"
6762,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Verlaine and Baudelaire in France, [Footnote: See Richard Hovey,"
6763,THE POET'S MORALITY,"_Verlaine_; Swinburne, _Ave atque Vale_.] and Lionel Johnson, Francis"
6764,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Thompson, Ernest Dowson, and James Thomson, B. V., in England, appeared"
6765,THE POET'S MORALITY,to prove the inseparability of genius and especial temptation. At this
6766,THE POET'S MORALITY,"time Francis Thompson, in his poetry, presented one of the most moving"
6767,THE POET'S MORALITY,"cases for the poet of frail morals, and concluded"
6768,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6769,THE POET'S MORALITY,What expiating agony
6770,THE POET'S MORALITY,May for him damned to poesy

6775,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6776,THE POET'S MORALITY,Such sympathetic portrayal of the erring poet perhaps hurts his case
6777,THE POET'S MORALITY,"more than does the bravado of the extreme decadent group. Philistines,"
6778,THE POET'S MORALITY,puritans and philosophers alike are prone to turn to such expositions as
6779,THE POET'S MORALITY,the one just quoted and point out that it is in exact accord with their
6780,THE POET'S MORALITY,"charge against the poet,--namely, that he is more susceptible to"
6781,THE POET'S MORALITY,"temptation than is ordinary humanity, and that therefore the proper"
6782,THE POET'S MORALITY,"course for true sympathizers would be, not to excuse his frailties, but"
6783,THE POET'S MORALITY,"to help him crush the germs of poetry out of his nature. ""Genius is a"
6784,THE POET'S MORALITY,"disease of the nerves,"" is Lombroso's formulation of the charge."
6785,THE POET'S MORALITY,[Footnote: _The Man of Genius_.] Nordau points out that the disease
6786,THE POET'S MORALITY,"is steadily increasing in these days of specialization, and that the"
6787,THE POET'S MORALITY,overkeenness of the poet's senses in one particular direction throws his
6788,THE POET'S MORALITY,"nature out of balance, so that he lacks the poise to withstand"
6789,THE POET'S MORALITY,temptation.
6790,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6791,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Fortunately, it is a comparatively small number of poets that surrenders"
6792,THE POET'S MORALITY,to the enemy by conceding either the poet's deliberate indulgence in
6793,THE POET'S MORALITY,"sin, or his pitiable moral frailty. If one were tempted to believe that"
6794,THE POET'S MORALITY,this defensive portrayal of the sinful poet is in any sense a major
6795,THE POET'S MORALITY,"conception in English poetry, the volley of repudiative verse greeting"
6796,THE POET'S MORALITY,every outcropping of the degenerate's self-exposure would offer a
6797,THE POET'S MORALITY,"sufficient disproof. In the romantic movement, for instance, one finds"
6798,THE POET'S MORALITY,only Byron (among persons of importance) to uphold the theory of the
6799,THE POET'S MORALITY,"perverted artist, whereas a chorus of contradiction greets each"
6800,THE POET'S MORALITY,expression of his theories.

6805,THE POET'S MORALITY,"See _Few Poets Beckon_, _Apology for Gebir_.] Later, when the wave of"

6807,THE POET'S MORALITY,"cudgels against the evil poet. [Footnote: See his treatment of Aretino,"

6809,THE POET'S MORALITY,"flourished in the 1890's even yet rocks the poetic waves slightly,"
6810,THE POET'S MORALITY,though these men did not succeed in making the world take them as
6811,THE POET'S MORALITY,seriously as it did Byron. The cue of most present-day writers is to
6812,THE POET'S MORALITY,"dismiss the professedly wicked poet lightly, as an aspirant to the"
6813,THE POET'S MORALITY,laurel who is unworthy of serious consideration. A contemporary poet
6814,THE POET'S MORALITY,reflects of such would-be riders of Pegasus:
6815,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6816,THE POET'S MORALITY,There will be fools that in the name of art
6817,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Will wallow in the mire, crying, ""I fall,"

6825,THE POET'S MORALITY,Poets who indignantly repudiate any and all charges against their moral
6826,THE POET'S MORALITY,natures have not been unanimous in following the same line of defense.
6827,THE POET'S MORALITY,"In many cases their argument is empirical, and their procedure is"
6828,THE POET'S MORALITY,ideally simple. If a verse-writer of the present time is convicted of
6829,THE POET'S MORALITY,"wrong living, his title of poet is automatically taken away from him; if"
6830,THE POET'S MORALITY,"a singer of the past is secure in his laurels, it is understood that all"
6831,THE POET'S MORALITY,scandals regarding him are merely malicious fictions. In the eighteenth
6832,THE POET'S MORALITY,century this mode of passing judgment was most naïvely manifest in
6833,THE POET'S MORALITY,verse. Vile versifiers were invariably accused of having vile personal
6834,THE POET'S MORALITY,"lives, whereas the poet who basked in the light of fame was conceded,"
6835,THE POET'S MORALITY,"without investigation, to ""exult in virtue's pure ethereal flame."" In"
6836,THE POET'S MORALITY,"the nineteenth century, when literary criticism was given over to"
6837,THE POET'S MORALITY,"prose-writers, those ostensible friends of the poets held by the same"
6838,THE POET'S MORALITY,"simple formula, as witness the attempts to kill literary and moral"
6839,THE POET'S MORALITY,"reputation at one blow, which were made, at various times, by Lockhart,"
6840,THE POET'S MORALITY,Christopher North and Robert Buchanan. [Footnote: Note their respective

6842,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6843,THE POET'S MORALITY,It may indicate a certain weakness in this hard and fast rule that
6844,THE POET'S MORALITY,considerable difficulty is encountered in working it backward. The
6845,THE POET'S MORALITY,"highest virtue does not always entail a supreme poetic gift, though"
6846,THE POET'S MORALITY,"poets and their friends have sometimes implied as much. Southey, in his"
6847,THE POET'S MORALITY,"critical writings, is likely to confuse his own virtue and that of his"
6848,THE POET'S MORALITY,"protégé, Kirke White, with poetical excellence. Longfellow's,"
6849,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Whittier's, Bryant's strength of character has frequently been"
6850,THE POET'S MORALITY,represented by patriotic American critics as guaranteeing the quality of
6851,THE POET'S MORALITY,their poetical wares.
6852,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6853,THE POET'S MORALITY,Since a claim for the insunderability of virtue and genius seems to lead
6854,THE POET'S MORALITY,"one to unfortunate conclusions, it has been rashly conceded in certain"
6855,THE POET'S MORALITY,quarters that the virtue of a great poet may have no immediate
6856,THE POET'S MORALITY,connection with his poetic gift. It is conceived by a few nervously
6857,THE POET'S MORALITY,"moral poets that morality and art dwell in separate spheres, and that"
6858,THE POET'S MORALITY,the first transcends the second. Tennyson started a fashion for viewing
6859,THE POET'S MORALITY,"the two excellences as distinct, comparing them, in _In Memoriam_:"
6860,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6861,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Loveliness of perfect deeds,"
6862,THE POET'S MORALITY,"More strong than all poetic thought,"
6863,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6864,THE POET'S MORALITY,and his disciples have continued to speak in this strain. This is the
6865,THE POET'S MORALITY,"tenor, for instance, of Jean Ingelow's _Letters of Life and Morning_, in"
6866,THE POET'S MORALITY,"which she exhorts the young poet,"
6867,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6868,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Learn to sing,"
6869,THE POET'S MORALITY,"But first in all thy learning, learn to be."
6870,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6871,THE POET'S MORALITY,"The puritan element in American literary circles, always troubling the"
6872,THE POET'S MORALITY,"conscience of a would-be poet, makes him eager to protest that virtue,"

6886,THE POET'S MORALITY,Even Whittier is not sure that poetical excellence is worthy to be

6893,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6894,THE POET'S MORALITY,When the poet of more firmly grounded conviction attempts to show reason
6895,THE POET'S MORALITY,"for his confidence in the poet's virtue, he may advance such an argument"
6896,THE POET'S MORALITY,for the association of righteousness and genius as has been offered by
6897,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Carlyle in his essay, _The Hero as Poet_. This is the theory that, far"
6898,THE POET'S MORALITY,"from being an example of nervous degeneration, as his enemies assert,"
6899,THE POET'S MORALITY,"the poet is a superman, possessing will and moral insight in as"
6900,THE POET'S MORALITY,"preëminent a degree as he possesses sensibility. This view, that poetry"
6901,THE POET'S MORALITY,"is merely a by-product of a great nature, gains plausibility from"
6902,THE POET'S MORALITY,"certain famous artists of history, whose versatility appears to have"
6903,THE POET'S MORALITY,been unlimited. Longfellow has seized upon this conception of the poet
6904,THE POET'S MORALITY,"in his drama, _Michael Angelo_, as has G. L. Raymond in his drama,"
6905,THE POET'S MORALITY,_Dante_. In the latter poem the argument for the poet's moral supremacy
6906,THE POET'S MORALITY,is baldly set forth.
6907,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6908,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Artistic sensibility, Dante says, far from excusing moral laxity, binds"
6909,THE POET'S MORALITY,one to stricter standards of right living. So when Cavalcanti argues in

6916,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6917,THE POET'S MORALITY,"The poets are not lesser men, but greater,"

6919,THE POET'S MORALITY,"A word, a deed, that makes them seem less worthy."
6920,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6921,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Owing to the growth of specialization in modern life, this argument,"
6922,THE POET'S MORALITY,"despite Carlyle, has not attained much popularity. Even in idealized"
6923,THE POET'S MORALITY,"fictions of the poet, it is not often maintained that he is equally"
6924,THE POET'S MORALITY,proficient in every line of activity. Only one actual poet within our
6925,THE POET'S MORALITY,"period, William Morris, can be taken as representative of such a type,"
6926,THE POET'S MORALITY,and he does not afford a strong argument for the poet's distinctive
6927,THE POET'S MORALITY,"virtue, inasmuch as tradition does not represent him as numbering"
6928,THE POET'S MORALITY,remarkable saintliness among his numerous gifts.
6929,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6930,THE POET'S MORALITY,"There is a decided inconsistency, moreover, in claiming unusual strength"
6931,THE POET'S MORALITY,of will as one of the poet's attributes. The muscular morality resulting
6932,THE POET'S MORALITY,from training one's will develops in proportion to one's ability to
6933,THE POET'S MORALITY,overthrow one's own unruly impulses. It is almost universally maintained
6934,THE POET'S MORALITY,"by poets, on the contrary, that their gift depends upon their yielding"
6935,THE POET'S MORALITY,themselves utterly to every fugitive impulse and emotion. Little modern
6936,THE POET'S MORALITY,"verse vaunts the poet's stern self-control. George Meredith may cry,"

6945,THE POET'S MORALITY,than is this one.
6946,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6947,THE POET'S MORALITY,Hardly more popular than the superman theory is another argument for the
6948,THE POET'S MORALITY,poet's virtue that appears sporadically in verse. It has occurred to a
6949,THE POET'S MORALITY,few poets that their virtue is accounted for by the high subject-matter
6950,THE POET'S MORALITY,"of their work, which exercises an unconscious influence upon their"
6951,THE POET'S MORALITY,lives. Thus in the eighteenth century Young finds it natural that in

6958,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6959,THE POET'S MORALITY,Middle-class didactic poetry of the Victorian era expresses the same

6972,THE POET'S MORALITY,"This explanation may account for the piety of a Newman, a Keble, a"
6973,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Charles Wesley, but how can it be stretched to cover the average poet of"
6974,THE POET'S MORALITY,"the last century, whose subject-matter is so largely himself? Conforming"
6975,THE POET'S MORALITY,his conduct to the theme of his verse would surely be no more
6976,THE POET'S MORALITY,efficacious than attempting to lift himself by his own boot straps.
6977,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6978,THE POET'S MORALITY,These two occasional arguments leave the real issue untouched. The real
6979,THE POET'S MORALITY,ground for the poet's faith in his moral intuitions lies in his
6980,THE POET'S MORALITY,"subscription to the old Platonic doctrine of the trinity,--the"
6981,THE POET'S MORALITY,"fundamental identity of the good, the true and the beautiful."
6982,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6983,THE POET'S MORALITY,There is something in the nature of a practical joke in the facility
6984,THE POET'S MORALITY,"with which Plato's bitter enemies, the poets, have fitted to themselves"
6985,THE POET'S MORALITY,his superlative praise of the philosopher's virtue. [Footnote: See the
6986,THE POET'S MORALITY,"_Republic_, VI, 485, ff.] The moral instincts of the philosopher"
6987,THE POET'S MORALITY,"are unerring, Plato declares, because the philosopher's attention is"
6988,THE POET'S MORALITY,riveted upon the unchanging idea of the good which underlies the
6989,THE POET'S MORALITY,confusing phantasmagoria of the temporal world. The poets retort that
6990,THE POET'S MORALITY,"the moral instincts of the poet, more truly than of the philosopher, are"
6991,THE POET'S MORALITY,"unerring, because the poet's attention is fixed upon the good in its"
6992,THE POET'S MORALITY,"most ravishing aspect, that of beauty, and in this guise it has an"
6993,THE POET'S MORALITY,irresistible charm which it cannot hold even for the philosopher.
6994,THE POET'S MORALITY,
6995,THE POET'S MORALITY,Poets' convictions on this point have remained essentially unchanged
6996,THE POET'S MORALITY,throughout the history of poetry. Granted that there has been a strain
6997,THE POET'S MORALITY,"of deliberate perversity running through its course, cropping out in the"
6998,THE POET'S MORALITY,"erotic excesses of the late-classic period, springing up anew in one"
6999,THE POET'S MORALITY,"phase of the Italian renaissance, transplanted to France and England,"
7000,THE POET'S MORALITY,"where it appeared at the time of the English restoration, growing again"
7001,THE POET'S MORALITY,"in France at the time of the literary revolution, thence spreading"
7002,THE POET'S MORALITY,across the channel into England again. Yet this is a minor current. The
7003,THE POET'S MORALITY,only serious view of the poet's moral nature is that nurtured by the
7004,THE POET'S MORALITY,Platonism of every age. Milton gave it the formulation most familiar to
7005,THE POET'S MORALITY,"English ears, but Milton by no means originated it. Not only from his"
7006,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Greek studies, but from his knowledge of contemporary Italian æsthetics,"
7007,THE POET'S MORALITY,he derived the idea of the harmony between the poet's life and his
7008,THE POET'S MORALITY,creations which led him to maintain that it is the poet's privilege to
7009,THE POET'S MORALITY,make of his own life a true poem.
7010,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7011,THE POET'S MORALITY,"""I am wont day and night,"" says Milton, ""to seek for this idea of the"
7012,THE POET'S MORALITY,beautiful through all the forms and faces of things (for many are the

7015,THE POET'S MORALITY,The poet's feeling cannot possibly lead him astray when his sense of
7016,THE POET'S MORALITY,beauty affords him a talisman revealing all the ugliness and
7017,THE POET'S MORALITY,"repulsiveness of evil. Even Byron had, in theory at least, a glimmering"

7027,THE POET'S MORALITY,"If Byron could be brought to confess the inharmonious nature of evil, it"
7028,THE POET'S MORALITY,is obvious that to most poets the beauty of goodness has been
7029,THE POET'S MORALITY,undeniable. In the eighteenth century Collins and Hughes wrote poems
7030,THE POET'S MORALITY,wherein they elaborated Milton's argument for the unity of the good and
7031,THE POET'S MORALITY,"the beautiful.[Footnote: Collins, _Ode on the Poetical Character_;"
7032,THE POET'S MORALITY,"John Hughes, _Ode on Divine Poetry_.] Among the romantic poets, the"
7033,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Platonism of Coleridge,[Footnote: See his essay on Claudian, where he"
7034,THE POET'S MORALITY,"says, ""I am pleased to think that when a mere stripling I formed the"
7035,THE POET'S MORALITY,"opinion that true taste was virtue, and that bad writing was bad"
7036,THE POET'S MORALITY,"feeling.""] Wordsworth, Shelley and Keats was unflinching in this"
7037,THE POET'S MORALITY,particular. The Brownings subscribed to the doctrine. Tennyson's
7038,THE POET'S MORALITY,"allegiance to scientific naturalism kept him in doubt for a time, but in"
7039,THE POET'S MORALITY,"the end his faith in beauty triumphed, and he was ready to praise the"
7040,THE POET'S MORALITY,poet as inevitably possessing a nature exquisitely attuned to goodness.
7041,THE POET'S MORALITY,One often runs across dogmatic expression of the doctrine in minor
7042,THE POET'S MORALITY,"poetry. W. A. Percy advises the poet,"
7043,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7044,THE POET'S MORALITY,"O singing heart, think not of aught save song,"
7045,THE POET'S MORALITY,Beauty can do no wrong.
7046,THE POET'S MORALITY,[Footnote: _Song_.]
7047,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7048,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Again one hears of the singer,"
7049,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7050,THE POET'S MORALITY,Pure must he be;
7051,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Oh, blessed are the pure; for they shall hear"
7052,THE POET'S MORALITY,Where others hear not; see where others see

7061,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7062,THE POET'S MORALITY,Only recently a writer has pictured the poet as one who
7063,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7064,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Lived beyond men, and so stood"
7065,THE POET'S MORALITY,Admitted to the brotherhood
7066,THE POET'S MORALITY,Of beauty.
7067,THE POET'S MORALITY,"[Footnote: Madison Cawein, _The Dreamer of Dreams_.]"
7068,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7069,THE POET'S MORALITY,It is needless to run through the list of poet heroes. Practically all
7070,THE POET'S MORALITY,of them look to a single standard to govern them æsthetically and
7071,THE POET'S MORALITY,"morally. They are the sort of men whom Watts-Dunton praises,"
7072,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7073,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Whose poems are their lives, whose souls within Hold naught in dread"
7074,THE POET'S MORALITY,"save Art's high conscience bar, Who know how beauty dies at touch of"
7075,THE POET'S MORALITY,sin. [Footnote: _The Silent Voices_.]
7076,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7077,THE POET'S MORALITY,Such is the poet's case for himself. But no matter how eloquently he
7078,THE POET'S MORALITY,"presents his case, his quarrel with his three enemies remains almost as"
7079,THE POET'S MORALITY,"bitter as before, and he is obliged to pay some attention to their"
7080,THE POET'S MORALITY,individual charges.
7081,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7082,THE POET'S MORALITY,"The poet's quarrel with the philistine, in particular, is far from"
7083,THE POET'S MORALITY,settled. The more lyrical the poet becomes regarding the unity of the
7084,THE POET'S MORALITY,"good and the beautiful, the more skeptical becomes the plain man. What"
7085,THE POET'S MORALITY,is this about the irresistible charm of virtue? Virtue has possessed the
7086,THE POET'S MORALITY,"plain man's joyless fidelity for years, and he has never discovered any"
7087,THE POET'S MORALITY,charm in her. The poet possesses a peculiar power of insight which
7088,THE POET'S MORALITY,reveals in goodness hidden beauties to which ordinary humanity is blind?
7089,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Let him prove it, then, by being as good in the same way as ordinary"
7090,THE POET'S MORALITY,folk are. If the poet professes to be able to achieve righteousness
7091,THE POET'S MORALITY,"without effort, the only way to prove it is to conform his conduct to"
7092,THE POET'S MORALITY,that of men who achieve righteousness with groaning of spirit. It is too
7093,THE POET'S MORALITY,easy for the poet to justify any and every aberration with the
7094,THE POET'S MORALITY,"announcement, ""My sixth sense for virtue, which you do not possess, has"
7095,THE POET'S MORALITY,"revealed to me the propriety of such conduct."" Thus reasons the"
7096,THE POET'S MORALITY,philistine.
7097,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7098,THE POET'S MORALITY,"The beauty-blind philistine doubtless has some cause for bewilderment,"
7099,THE POET'S MORALITY,but the poet takes no pains to placate him. The more genuine is one's
7100,THE POET'S MORALITY,"impulse toward goodness, the more inevitably, the poet says, will it"
7101,THE POET'S MORALITY,bring one into conflict with an artificial code of morals. Shelley
7102,THE POET'S MORALITY,"indicated this at length in _The Defense of Poetry_, and in both"
7103,THE POET'S MORALITY,_Rosalind and Helen_ and _The Revolt of Islam_ he showed his bards
7104,THE POET'S MORALITY,offending the world by their original conceptions of purity. Likewise of
7105,THE POET'S MORALITY,"the poet-hero in _Prince Athanase_ Shelley tells us,"
7106,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7107,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Fearless he was, and scorning all disguise."
7108,THE POET'S MORALITY,"What he dared do or think, though men might start"
7109,THE POET'S MORALITY,"He spoke with mild, yet unaverted eyes."
7110,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7111,THE POET'S MORALITY,"It must be admitted that sometimes, notably in Victorian narrative"
7112,THE POET'S MORALITY,"verse, the fictitious poet's virtue is inclined to lapse into a"
7113,THE POET'S MORALITY,typically bourgeois respectability. In Mrs. Browning's _Aurora
7114,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Leigh_, for instance, the heroine's morality becomes somewhat rigid,"
7115,THE POET'S MORALITY,"and when she rebukes the unmarried Marian for bearing a child, and"
7116,THE POET'S MORALITY,chides Romney for speaking tenderly to her after his supposed marriage
7117,THE POET'S MORALITY,"with Lady Waldemar, the reader is apt to sense in her a most unpoetical"
7118,THE POET'S MORALITY,resemblance to Mrs. Grundy. And if Mrs. Browning's poet is almost too
7119,THE POET'S MORALITY,"respectable, she is still not worthy to be mentioned in the same breath"
7120,THE POET'S MORALITY,"with the utterly innocuous poet set forth by another Victorian, Coventry"
7121,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Patmore. In Patmore's poem, _Olympus_, the bard decides to spend an"
7122,THE POET'S MORALITY,"evening with his own sex, but he is offended by the cigar smoke and the"
7123,THE POET'S MORALITY,"coarse jests, and flees home to"
7124,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7125,THE POET'S MORALITY,The milk-soup men call domestic bliss.
7126,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7127,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Likewise, in _The Angel in the House_, the poet follows a most"
7128,THE POET'S MORALITY,"domestic line of orderly living. Only once, in the long poem, does he"
7129,THE POET'S MORALITY,fall below the standard of conduct he sets for himself. This sin
7130,THE POET'S MORALITY,"consists of pressing his sweetheart's hand in the dance, and after"
7131,THE POET'S MORALITY,"shamefacedly confessing it, he adds,"
7132,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7133,THE POET'S MORALITY,"And ere I slept, on bended knee"
7134,THE POET'S MORALITY,"I owned myself, with many a tear"
7135,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Unseasonable, disorderly."
7136,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7137,THE POET'S MORALITY,"But so distasteful, to the average poet, is such cringing subservience"
7138,THE POET'S MORALITY,"to philistine standards, that he takes delight in swinging to the other"
7139,THE POET'S MORALITY,"extreme, and representing the innocent poet's persecutions at the hands"
7140,THE POET'S MORALITY,of an unfriendly world. He insists that in venturing away from
7141,THE POET'S MORALITY,"conventional standards poets merit every consideration, being"

7148,THE POET'S MORALITY,"He is convinced that the public, far from sympathizing with such"
7149,THE POET'S MORALITY,"courage, deliberately tries to drive the poet to desperation. Josephine"

7151,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7152,THE POET'S MORALITY,"My sins they learn by rote,"

7160,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7161,THE POET'S MORALITY,"In the same spirit Richard Le Gallienne, in lines _On the Morals of"
7162,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Poets_, warns their detractor,"

7164,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Bigot, one folly of the man you flout"
7165,THE POET'S MORALITY,Is more to God than thy lean life is whole.
7166,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7167,THE POET'S MORALITY,"If it be true that the poet occasionally commits an error, he points out"
7168,THE POET'S MORALITY,"that it is the result of the philistine's corruption, not his own. He"
7169,THE POET'S MORALITY,"acknowledges that it is fatally easy to lead him, not astray perhaps,"
7170,THE POET'S MORALITY,"but into gravely compromising himself, because he is characterized by a"
7171,THE POET'S MORALITY,childlike inability to comprehend the very existence of sin in the
7172,THE POET'S MORALITY,world. Of course his environment has a good deal to do with this. The
7173,THE POET'S MORALITY,"innocent shepherd poet, shut off from crime by many a grassy hill and"
7174,THE POET'S MORALITY,"purling stream, has a long tradition behind him. The most typical"
7175,THE POET'S MORALITY,"pastoral poet of our period, the hero of Beattie's _The Minstrel_,"
7176,THE POET'S MORALITY,suffers a rude shock when an old hermit reveals to him that all the
7177,THE POET'S MORALITY,world is not as fair and good as his immediate environment. The
7178,THE POET'S MORALITY,"innocence of Wordsworth, and of the young Sordello, were fostered by"
7179,THE POET'S MORALITY,"like circumstances. Arnold conceives of Clough in this way, isolating"
7180,THE POET'S MORALITY,"him in Oxford instead of Arcadia, and represents him as dying from the"
7181,THE POET'S MORALITY,shock of awakening to conditions as they are. But environment alone does
7182,THE POET'S MORALITY,"not account for a large per cent of our poet heroes, the tragedy of"
7183,THE POET'S MORALITY,whose lives most often results from a pathetic inability to recognize
7184,THE POET'S MORALITY,evil motives when they are face to face with them.
7185,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7186,THE POET'S MORALITY,Insistence upon the childlike nature of the poet is a characteristic
7187,THE POET'S MORALITY,nineteenth century obsession. Such temperamentally diverse poets as Mrs.
7188,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Browning, [Footnote: See _A Vision of Poets_.] Swinburne [Footnote:"
7189,THE POET'S MORALITY,See _A New Year's Ode_.] and Francis Thompson [Footnote: See _Sister
7190,THE POET'S MORALITY,Songs_.] agree in stressing this aspect of the poet's virtue. Perhaps it
7191,THE POET'S MORALITY,"has been overdone, and the resulting picture of the singer as ""an"
7192,THE POET'S MORALITY,"ineffectual angel, beating his bright wings in the void,"" is not so"
7193,THE POET'S MORALITY,"noble a conception as was Milton's sterner one, but it lends to the"
7194,THE POET'S MORALITY,poet-hero a pathos that has had much to do with popularizing the type in
7195,THE POET'S MORALITY,"literature, causing the reader to exclaim, with Shelley,"
7196,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7197,THE POET'S MORALITY,The curse of Cain
7198,THE POET'S MORALITY,Light on his head who pierced thy innocent breast
7199,THE POET'S MORALITY,And scared the angel soul that was its earthly guest.
7200,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7201,THE POET'S MORALITY,Of course the vogue of such a conception owes most to Shelley. All the
7202,THE POET'S MORALITY,"poets appearing in Shelley's verse, the heroes of _Rosalind and Helen,"
7203,THE POET'S MORALITY,"The Revolt of Islam, Adonais, Epipsychidion_ and _Prince Athanase_,"
7204,THE POET'S MORALITY,share the disposition of the last-named one:
7205,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7206,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Naught of ill his heart could understand,"
7207,THE POET'S MORALITY,But pity and wild sorrow for the same.
7208,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7209,THE POET'S MORALITY,It is obvious that all these singers are only veiled expositions of
7210,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Shelley's own character, as he understood it, and all enthusiastic"
7211,THE POET'S MORALITY,readers of Shelley's poetry have pictured an ideal poet who is
7212,THE POET'S MORALITY,"reminiscent of Shelley. Even a poet so different from him, in many"
7213,THE POET'S MORALITY,"respects, as Browning, could not escape from the impress of Shelley's"
7214,THE POET'S MORALITY,character upon his ideal. Browning seems to have recognized fleeting
7215,THE POET'S MORALITY,"glimpses of Shelley in _Sordello_, and to have acknowledged them in"
7216,THE POET'S MORALITY,his apostrophe to Shelley at the beginning of that poem. Browning's
7217,THE POET'S MORALITY,"revulsion of feeling, after he discovered Shelley's abandonment of"
7218,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Harriet, did not prevent him from holding to his early ideal of Shelley"
7219,THE POET'S MORALITY,"as the typical poet. A poem by James Thomson, B.V., is characteristic of"
7220,THE POET'S MORALITY,later poets' notion of Shelley. The scene of the poem is laid in heaven.
7221,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Shelley, as the most compassionate of the angels, is chosen to go to the"
7222,THE POET'S MORALITY,"earth, to right its evils. He comes to this world and lives with ""the"
7223,THE POET'S MORALITY,"saint's white purity,"" being"
7224,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7225,THE POET'S MORALITY,"A voice of right amidst a world's foul wrong,"
7226,THE POET'S MORALITY,*       *       *       *       *
7227,THE POET'S MORALITY,"With heavenly inspiration, too divine"

7233,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7234,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Aside from Shelley, Marlowe is the historical poet most frequently"
7235,THE POET'S MORALITY,chosen to illustrate the world's proneness to take advantage of the
7236,THE POET'S MORALITY,"poet's innocence. In the most famous of the poems about Marlowe, _The"
7237,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Death of Marlowe_, R. H. Horne takes a hopeful view of the world's"
7238,THE POET'S MORALITY,"depravity, for he makes Marlowe's innocence of evil so touching that it"
7239,THE POET'S MORALITY,"moves a prostitute to reform. Other poets, however, have painted"
7240,THE POET'S MORALITY,Marlowe's associates as villains of far deeper dye. In the drama by
7241,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Josephine Preston Peabody, the persecutions of hypocritical puritans"
7242,THE POET'S MORALITY,hound Marlowe to his death. [Footnote: _Marlowe._]
7243,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7244,THE POET'S MORALITY,"The most representative view of Marlowe as an innocent, deceived youth"
7245,THE POET'S MORALITY,"is that presented by Alfred Noyes, in _At the Sign of the Golden"
7246,THE POET'S MORALITY,Shoe_. In this poem we find Nash describing to the Mermaid group
7247,THE POET'S MORALITY,"thetragic end of Marlowe, who lies"
7248,THE POET'S MORALITY,

7274,THE POET'S MORALITY,Won by her pathetic account of her virtues and trials Marlowe tried to
7275,THE POET'S MORALITY,"help her to escape from London-then, because he was utterly unused to"

7292,THE POET'S MORALITY,"and loathing, Marlowe broke away from her. The next day, as Nash was"
7293,THE POET'S MORALITY,"loitering in a group including this woman and her lover, Archer, someone"
7294,THE POET'S MORALITY,ran in to warn Archer that a man was on his way to kill him. As Marlowe
7295,THE POET'S MORALITY,"strode into the place, Nash was struck afresh by his beauty:"

7297,THE POET'S MORALITY,"I saw his face,"

7310,THE POET'S MORALITY,Minor writers are most impartial in clearing the names of any and all
7311,THE POET'S MORALITY,historical artists by such reasoning as this. By negligible American
7312,THE POET'S MORALITY,"versifiers one too often finds Burns lauded as one whom ""such purity"

7314,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Byron conceived of as a misjudged innocent. If one is surprised to hear,"

7326,THE POET'S MORALITY,Better known poets are likely to admit a streak of imperfection in a few
7327,THE POET'S MORALITY,"of their number, while maintaining their essential goodness. It is"
7328,THE POET'S MORALITY,"refreshing, after witnessing too much whitewashing of Burns, to find"
7329,THE POET'S MORALITY,James Russell Lowell bringing Burns down to a level where the attacks of
7330,THE POET'S MORALITY,"philistines, though unwarranted, are not sacrilegious. Lowell imagines"
7331,THE POET'S MORALITY,Holy Willie trying to shut Burns out of heaven. He accuses Burns first
7332,THE POET'S MORALITY,"of irreligion, but St. Paul protests against his exclusion on that"
7333,THE POET'S MORALITY,"ground. At the charges of drunkenness, and of yearning ""o'er-warmly"
7334,THE POET'S MORALITY,"toward the lasses,"" Noah and David come severally to his defense. In the"
7335,THE POET'S MORALITY,"end, Burns' great charity is felt to offset all his failings, and Lowell"
7336,THE POET'S MORALITY,"adds, of poets in general,"
7337,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7338,THE POET'S MORALITY,These larger hearts must feel the rolls
7339,THE POET'S MORALITY,Of stormier-waved temptation;

7343,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7344,THE POET'S MORALITY,Browning is willing to allow even fictitious artists to be driven into
7345,THE POET'S MORALITY,imperfect conduct by the failure of those about them to live up to their
7346,THE POET'S MORALITY,"standards. For example, Fra Lippo Lippi, disgusted with the barren"
7347,THE POET'S MORALITY,"virtue of the monks, confesses,"
7348,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7349,THE POET'S MORALITY,I do these wild things in sheer despite
7350,THE POET'S MORALITY,And play the fooleries you catch me at
7351,THE POET'S MORALITY,In sheer rage.
7352,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7353,THE POET'S MORALITY,"But invariably, whatever a poet hero's failings maybe, the author"
7354,THE POET'S MORALITY,assures the philistine public that it is entirely to blame.
7355,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7356,THE POET'S MORALITY,If the poet is unable to find common ground with the plain man on which
7357,THE POET'S MORALITY,"he can make his morality sympathetically understood, his quarrel with"
7358,THE POET'S MORALITY,"the puritan is foredoomed to unsuccessful issue, for whereas the plain"
7359,THE POET'S MORALITY,"man will wink at a certain type of indulgence, the puritan will be"
7360,THE POET'S MORALITY,"satisfied with nothing but iron restraint on the poet's part, and"
7361,THE POET'S MORALITY,systematic thwarting of the impulses which are the breath of life to
7362,THE POET'S MORALITY,him.
7363,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7364,THE POET'S MORALITY,The poet's only hope of winning in his argument with the puritan lies in
7365,THE POET'S MORALITY,the possibility that the race of puritans is destined for extinction.
7366,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Certainly they were much more numerous fifty years ago than now, and"
7367,THE POET'S MORALITY,consequently more voluble in their denunciation of the poet. At that
7368,THE POET'S MORALITY,time they found their most redoubtable antagonists in the Brownings.
7369,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Robert Browning devoted a poem, _With Francis Furini_, to exposing the"
7370,THE POET'S MORALITY,"incompatibility of asceticism and art, while Mrs. Browning, in _The"
7371,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Poet's Vow_, worked out the tragic consequences of the hero's mistaken"
7372,THE POET'S MORALITY,"determination to retire from the world,"
7373,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7374,THE POET'S MORALITY,"That so my purged, once human heart,"
7375,THE POET'S MORALITY,"From all the human rent,"
7376,THE POET'S MORALITY,May gather strength to pledge and drink
7377,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Your wine of wonderment,"
7378,THE POET'S MORALITY,While you pardon me all blessingly
7379,THE POET'S MORALITY,The woe mine Adam sent.
7380,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7381,THE POET'S MORALITY,In the end Mrs. Browning makes her poet realize that he is crushing the
7382,THE POET'S MORALITY,best part of his nature by thus thwarting his human instincts.
7383,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7384,THE POET'S MORALITY,"No, the poet's virtue must not be a pruning of his human nature, but a"
7385,THE POET'S MORALITY,flowering of it. Nowhere are the Brownings more in sympathy than in
7386,THE POET'S MORALITY,"their recognition of this fact. In _Pauline_, Browning traces the poet's"
7387,THE POET'S MORALITY,mistaken effort to find goodness in self-restraint and denial. It is a
7388,THE POET'S MORALITY,"failure, and the poem ends with the hero's recognition that ""life is"
7389,THE POET'S MORALITY,"truth, and truth is good."" The same idea is one of the leading motives"
7390,THE POET'S MORALITY,in _Sordello_.
7391,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7392,THE POET'S MORALITY,One seems to be coming perilously near the decadent poet's argument
7393,THE POET'S MORALITY,again. And there remains to be dealt with a poet more extreme than
7394,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Browning--Walt Whitman, who challenges us with his slogan, ""Clear and"
7395,THE POET'S MORALITY,"sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is not my soul,"""
7396,THE POET'S MORALITY,[Footnote: _Song of Myself_.] and then records his zest in throwing
7397,THE POET'S MORALITY,himself into all phases of life.
7398,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7399,THE POET'S MORALITY,"It is plain, at any rate, how the abandon of the decadent might develop"
7400,THE POET'S MORALITY,"from the poet's insistence upon his need to follow impulse utterly, to"
7401,THE POET'S MORALITY,develop himself in all directions. The cry of Browning's poet in
7402,THE POET'S MORALITY,"_Pauline_,"
7403,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7404,THE POET'S MORALITY,I had resolved

7419,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7420,THE POET'S MORALITY,"show that in a revulsion from the asceticism of the puritan, no less"
7421,THE POET'S MORALITY,"than in a revulsion from the stupidity of the plain man, it may become"
7422,THE POET'S MORALITY,easy for the poet to carry his _carpe diem_ philosophy very far. His
7423,THE POET'S MORALITY,"talisman, pure love of beauty, must be indeed unerring if it is to"
7424,THE POET'S MORALITY,guide aright his
7425,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7426,THE POET'S MORALITY,principle of restlessness
7427,THE POET'S MORALITY,"That would be all, have, see, know, taste, feel, all"
7428,THE POET'S MORALITY,[Footnote: _Pauline_.]
7429,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7430,THE POET'S MORALITY,"The puritan sees, with grim pleasure, that an occasional poet confesses"
7431,THE POET'S MORALITY,that his sense of beauty is not strong enough to lead him at all times.
7432,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Emerson admits this, telling us, in _The Poet_, that although the"
7433,THE POET'S MORALITY,singer perceives ideals in his moments of afflatus which
7434,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7435,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Turn his heart from lovely maids,"
7436,THE POET'S MORALITY,And make the darlings of the earth
7437,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Swainish, coarse, and nothing worth,"
7438,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7439,THE POET'S MORALITY,"these moments of exaltation pass, and the singer finds himself a mere"
7440,THE POET'S MORALITY,"man, with an unusually rich sensuous nature,"
7441,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7442,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Eager for good, not hating ill;"
7443,THE POET'S MORALITY,"On his tense chords all strokes are felt,"
7444,THE POET'S MORALITY,"The good, the bad, with equal zeal."
7445,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7446,THE POET'S MORALITY,"It is not unheard-of to find a poet who, despite occasional expressions"
7447,THE POET'S MORALITY,"of confidence in the power of beauty to sustain him, loses his courage"
7448,THE POET'S MORALITY,"at other times, and lays down a system of rules for his guidance that is"
7449,THE POET'S MORALITY,quite as strict as any which puritans could formulate. Wordsworth's
7450,THE POET'S MORALITY,_Ode to Duty_ does not altogether embody the aesthetic conception
7451,THE POET'S MORALITY,"of effortless right living. One may, perhaps, explain this poem on the"
7452,THE POET'S MORALITY,"grounds that Wordsworth is laying down principles of conduct, not for"
7453,THE POET'S MORALITY,"poets, but for the world at large, which is blind to aesthetic"
7454,THE POET'S MORALITY,"principles. Not thus, however, may one account for the self-tortures of"
7455,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Arthur Clough, or of Christina Rossetti, who was fully aware of the"
7456,THE POET'S MORALITY,disagreeableness of the standards which she set up for herself. She
7457,THE POET'S MORALITY,"reflected grimly,"
7458,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7459,THE POET'S MORALITY,Does the road wind uphill all the way?
7460,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Yes, to the very end!"
7461,THE POET'S MORALITY,Will the day's journey take the whole long day?
7462,THE POET'S MORALITY,"From morn till night, my friend."
7463,THE POET'S MORALITY,[Footnote: _Uphill._]
7464,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7465,THE POET'S MORALITY,"It cannot be accidental, however, that wherever a poet voices a stern"
7466,THE POET'S MORALITY,"conception of virtue, he is a poet whose sensibility to physical beauty"
7467,THE POET'S MORALITY,is not noteworthy.  This is obviously true in the case of both Clough
7468,THE POET'S MORALITY,"and Christina Rossetti. At intervals it was true of Wordsworth, whereas"
7469,THE POET'S MORALITY,in the periods of his inspiration he expressed his belief that goodness
7470,THE POET'S MORALITY,is as a matter of good taste. The pleasures of the imagination were then
7471,THE POET'S MORALITY,so intense that they destroyed in him all desire for dubious delights.
7472,THE POET'S MORALITY,Thus in the _Prelude_ he described an unconscious purification of
7473,THE POET'S MORALITY,"his life by his worship of physical beauty, saying of nature,"
7474,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7475,THE POET'S MORALITY,"If in my youth I have been pure in heart,"
7476,THE POET'S MORALITY,"If, mingling with the world, I am content"
7477,THE POET'S MORALITY,"With my own modest pleasures, and have lived"
7478,THE POET'S MORALITY,"With God and Nature communing, removed"
7479,THE POET'S MORALITY,"From little enmities and low desires,"
7480,THE POET'S MORALITY,The gift is yours.
7481,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7482,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Dante Gabriel, not Christina, possessed the most purely poetical nature"
7483,THE POET'S MORALITY,"in the Rossetti family, and his moral conceptions were the typical"
7484,THE POET'S MORALITY,"aesthetic ones, as incomprehensible to the puritan as they were to"
7485,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Ruskin, who exclaimed, ""I don't say you do wrong, because you don't seem"
7486,THE POET'S MORALITY,"to know what is wrong, but you do just whatever you like as far as"
7487,THE POET'S MORALITY,"possible--as puppies and tomtits do."" [Footnote: See E. L. Cary, The"
7488,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Rossettis, p.79.] To poets themselves however, there appears nothing"
7489,THE POET'S MORALITY,"incomprehensible about the inevitable rightness of their conduct, for"
7490,THE POET'S MORALITY,they have not passed out of the happy stage of Wordsworth's _Ode to
7491,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Duty,_"
7492,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7493,THE POET'S MORALITY,"When love is an unerring light,"
7494,THE POET'S MORALITY,And joy its own felicity.
7495,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7496,THE POET'S MORALITY,"For the most part, whenever the puritan imagines that the poet has"
7497,THE POET'S MORALITY,"capitulated, he is mistaken, and the apparent self-denial in the poet's"
7498,THE POET'S MORALITY,life is really an exquisite sort of epicureanism. The likelihood of such
7499,THE POET'S MORALITY,"misunderstanding by the world is indicated by Browning in _Sordello,_"
7500,THE POET'S MORALITY,"wherein the hero refuses to taste the ordinary pleasures of life,"
7501,THE POET'S MORALITY,because he wishes to enjoy the flavor of the highest pleasure untainted.
7502,THE POET'S MORALITY,"He resolves,"
7503,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7504,THE POET'S MORALITY,The world shall bow to me conceiving all
7505,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Man's life, who see its blisses, great and small"
7506,THE POET'S MORALITY,Afar--not tasting any; no machine
7507,THE POET'S MORALITY,"To exercise my utmost will is mine,"
7508,THE POET'S MORALITY,Be mine mere consciousness: Let men perceive
7509,THE POET'S MORALITY,"What I could do, a mastery believe"
7510,THE POET'S MORALITY,Asserted and established to the throng
7511,THE POET'S MORALITY,"By their selected evidence of song,"
7512,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Which now shall prove, whate'er they are, or seek"
7513,THE POET'S MORALITY,"To be, I am."
7514,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7515,THE POET'S MORALITY,"The claims of the puritans being set aside, the poet must, finally, meet"
7516,THE POET'S MORALITY,"the objection of his third disputant, the philosopher, the one accuser"
7517,THE POET'S MORALITY,"whose charges the poet is wont to treat with respect. What validity, the"
7518,THE POET'S MORALITY,"philosopher asks, can be claimed for apprehension of truth, of the"
7519,THE POET'S MORALITY,"good-beautiful, secured not through the intellect, but through emotion?"
7520,THE POET'S MORALITY,What proof has the poet that feeling is as unerring in detecting the
7521,THE POET'S MORALITY,essential nature of the highest good as is the reason?
7522,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7523,THE POET'S MORALITY,There is great variance in the breach between philosophers and poets on
7524,THE POET'S MORALITY,"this point. Between the philosopher of purely rationalistic temper, and"
7525,THE POET'S MORALITY,the poet who
7526,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7527,THE POET'S MORALITY,dares to take
7528,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Life's rule from passion craved for passion's sake,"
7529,THE POET'S MORALITY,"[Footnote: Said of Byron. Wordsworth, _Not in the Lucid Intervals._]"
7530,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7531,THE POET'S MORALITY,"there is absolutely no common ground, of course.  Such a poet finds the"
7532,THE POET'S MORALITY,rigid ethical system of a rationalistic philosophy as uncharacteristic
7533,THE POET'S MORALITY,"of the actual fluidity of the world as ever Cratylus did. Feeling, but"
7534,THE POET'S MORALITY,"not reason, may be swift enough in its transformations to mirror the"
7535,THE POET'S MORALITY,"world, such a poet believes, and he imitates the actual flux of things,"
7536,THE POET'S MORALITY,"not with a wagging of the thumb, like Cratylus, but with a flutter of"
7537,THE POET'S MORALITY,"the heart. Thus one finds Byron characteristically asserting, ""I hold"
7538,THE POET'S MORALITY,"virtue, in general, or the virtues generally, to be only in the"
7539,THE POET'S MORALITY,"disposition, each a _feeling,_ not a principle."" [Footnote: _Letter to"
7540,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Charles Dallas,_ January 21, 1808.]"
7541,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7542,THE POET'S MORALITY,"On the other hand, one occasionally meets a point of view as opposite as"
7543,THE POET'S MORALITY,"that of Poe, who believed that the poet, no less than the philosopher,"
7544,THE POET'S MORALITY,"is governed by reason solely,--that the poetic imagination is a purely"
7545,THE POET'S MORALITY,intellectual function. [Footnote: See the _Southern Literary
7546,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Messenger,_ II, 328, April, 1836.]"
7547,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7548,THE POET'S MORALITY,The philosopher could have no quarrel with him. Between the two extremes
7549,THE POET'S MORALITY,"are the more thoughtful of the Victorian poets,--Browning, Tennyson,"
7550,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Arnold, Clough, whose taste leads them so largely to intellectual"
7551,THE POET'S MORALITY,pursuits that it is difficult to say whether their principles of moral
7552,THE POET'S MORALITY,conduct arise from the poetical or the philosophical part of their
7553,THE POET'S MORALITY,natures.
7554,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7555,THE POET'S MORALITY,"The most profound utterances of poets on this subject, however, show"
7556,THE POET'S MORALITY,"them to be, not rationalists, but thoroughgoing Platonists. The feeling"
7557,THE POET'S MORALITY,"in which they trust is a Platonic intuition which includes the reason,"
7558,THE POET'S MORALITY,"but exists above it. At least this is the view of Shelley, and Shelley"
7559,THE POET'S MORALITY,"has, more largely than any other man, moulded the beliefs of later"
7560,THE POET'S MORALITY,English poets. It is because he judges imaginative feeling to be always
7561,THE POET'S MORALITY,in harmony with the deepest truths perceived by the reason that he
7562,THE POET'S MORALITY,advertises his intention to purify men by awakening their feelings.
7563,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Therefore, in his preface to _The Revolt of Islam_ he says ""I would"
7564,THE POET'S MORALITY,"only awaken the feelings, so that the reader should see the beauty of"
7565,THE POET'S MORALITY,"true virtue."" in the preface to the _Cenci,_ again, he declares,"
7566,THE POET'S MORALITY,"""Imagination is as the immortal God which should take flesh for the"
7567,THE POET'S MORALITY,"redemption of human passion."""
7568,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7569,THE POET'S MORALITY,"The poet, while thus expressing absolute faith in the power of beauty to"
7570,THE POET'S MORALITY,"redeem the world, yet is obliged to take into account the Platonic"
7571,THE POET'S MORALITY,distinction between the beautiful and the lover of the beautiful.
7572,THE POET'S MORALITY,"[Footnote: _Symposium,_ § 204.]"
7573,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7574,THE POET'S MORALITY,"No man is pure poet, he admits, but in proportion as he approaches"
7575,THE POET'S MORALITY,"perfect artistry, his life is purified. Shelley is expressing the"
7576,THE POET'S MORALITY,"beliefs of practically all artists when he says, ""The greatest poets"
7577,THE POET'S MORALITY,"have been men of the most spotless virtue, of the most consummate"
7578,THE POET'S MORALITY,"prudence, and, if we would look into the interior of their lives, the"
7579,THE POET'S MORALITY,"most fortunate of men; and the exceptions, as they regard those who"
7580,THE POET'S MORALITY,"possess the poetical faculty in a high, yet an inferior degree, will be"
7581,THE POET'S MORALITY,"found upon consideration to confirm, rather than to destroy, the rule."""
7582,THE POET'S MORALITY,[Footnote: _The Defense of Poetry._]
7583,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7584,THE POET'S MORALITY,Sidney Lanier's verse expresses this argument of Shelley precisely. In
7585,THE POET'S MORALITY,"_The Crystal,_ Lanier indicates that the ideal poet has never been"
7586,THE POET'S MORALITY,"embodied. Pointing out the faults of his favorite poets, he contrasts"
7587,THE POET'S MORALITY,their muddy characters with the perfect purity of Christ. And in _Life
7588,THE POET'S MORALITY,and Song_ he repeats the same idea:
7589,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7590,THE POET'S MORALITY,None of the singers ever yet
7591,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Has wholly lived his minstrelsy,"
7592,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Or truly sung his true, true thought."
7593,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7594,THE POET'S MORALITY,Philosophers may retort that this imperfection in the singer's life
7595,THE POET'S MORALITY,arises not merely from the inevitable difference between the lover and
7596,THE POET'S MORALITY,"the beauty which he loves, but from the fact that the object of the"
7597,THE POET'S MORALITY,poet's love is not really that highest beauty which is identical with
7598,THE POET'S MORALITY,"the good. Poets are content with the ""many beautiful,"" Plato charges,"
7599,THE POET'S MORALITY,"instead of pressing on to discover the ""one beautiful,"" [Footnote:"
7600,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Republic, VI, 507B.]--that is, they are ravished by the beauty of the"
7601,THE POET'S MORALITY,"senses, rather than by the beauty of the ideal."
7602,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7603,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Possibly this is true. We have had, in recent verse, a sympathetic"
7604,THE POET'S MORALITY,"expression of the final step in Plato's ascent to absolute beauty, hence"
7605,THE POET'S MORALITY,"to absolute virtue. It is significant, however, that this verse is in"
7606,THE POET'S MORALITY,"the nature of a farewell to verse writing. In _The Symbol Seduces,_"
7607,THE POET'S MORALITY,"""A. E."" exclaims,"
7608,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7609,THE POET'S MORALITY,I leave
7610,THE POET'S MORALITY,"For Beauty, Beauty's rarest flower,"
7611,THE POET'S MORALITY,"For Truth, the lips that ne'er deceive;"
7612,THE POET'S MORALITY,"For Love, I leave Love's haunted bower."
7613,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7614,THE POET'S MORALITY,"But this is exactly what the poet, as poet, cannot do. It may be, as"
7615,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Plato declared, that he is missing the supreme value of life by clinging"
7616,THE POET'S MORALITY,"to the ""many beautiful,"" instead of the ""one beautiful,"" but if he does"
7617,THE POET'S MORALITY,"not do so, all the colour of his poetical garment falls away from him,"
7618,THE POET'S MORALITY,and he becomes pure philosopher. There is an infinite promise in the
7619,THE POET'S MORALITY,imperfection of the physical world that fascinates the poet. Life is to
7620,THE POET'S MORALITY,"him ""a dome of many colored glass"" that reveals, yet stains, ""the white"
7621,THE POET'S MORALITY,"radiance of eternity."" If it were possible for him to gaze upon beauty"
7622,THE POET'S MORALITY,"apart from her sensuous embodiment, it is doubtful if he would find her"
7623,THE POET'S MORALITY,ravishing.
7624,THE POET'S MORALITY,
7625,THE POET'S MORALITY,This is only to say that there is no escaping the fundamental aesthetic
7626,THE POET'S MORALITY,"problem. Is the artist the imitator of the physical world, or the"
7627,THE POET'S MORALITY,"revealer of the spiritual world? He is both, inevitably, if he is a"
7628,THE POET'S MORALITY,great poet. Hence there is a duality in his moral life. If one aspect of
7629,THE POET'S MORALITY,"his genius causes him to be rapt away from earthly things, in"
7630,THE POET'S MORALITY,"contemplation of the heavenly vision, the other aspect no less demands"
7631,THE POET'S MORALITY,"that he live, with however pure a standard, in the turmoil of earthly"
7632,THE POET'S MORALITY,"passions. In the period which we have under discussion, it is easy to"
7633,THE POET'S MORALITY,"separate the two types and choose between them. Enthusiasts may,"
7634,THE POET'S MORALITY,"according to their tastes, laud the poet of Byronic worldliness or of"
7635,THE POET'S MORALITY,"Shelleyan otherworldliness. But, of course, this is only because this"
7636,THE POET'S MORALITY,time boasts of no artist of first rank. When one considers the
7637,THE POET'S MORALITY,"preëminent names in the history of poetry, it is not so easy to make the"
7638,THE POET'S MORALITY,disjunction. If the gift of even so great a poet as Milton was
7639,THE POET'S MORALITY,"compatible with his developing one side of his genius only, we yet feel"
7640,THE POET'S MORALITY,"that Milton is a great poet with limitations, and cannot quite concede"
7641,THE POET'S MORALITY,"to him equal rank with Shakespeare, or Dante, in whom the hybrid nature"
7642,THE POET'S MORALITY,of the artist is manifest.

7650,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7651,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7652,THE POET'S RELIGION,"There was a time, if we may trust anthropologists, when the poet and the"
7653,THE POET'S RELIGION,"priest were identical, but the modern zeal for specialization has not"
7654,THE POET'S RELIGION,tolerated this doubling of function. So utterly has the poet been robbed
7655,THE POET'S RELIGION,"of his priestly character that he is notorious, nowadays, as possessing"
7656,THE POET'S RELIGION,"no religion at all. At least, representatives of the three strongest"
7657,THE POET'S RELIGION,"critical forces in society, philosophers, puritans and plain men, assert"
7658,THE POET'S RELIGION,with equal vehemence that the poet has no religion that agrees with
7659,THE POET'S RELIGION,their interpretation of that word.
7660,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7661,THE POET'S RELIGION,"As was the case in their attack upon the poet's morals, so in the"
7662,THE POET'S RELIGION,"refusal to recognize his religious beliefs, the poet's three enemies are"
7663,THE POET'S RELIGION,in merely accidental agreement. The philosopher condemns the poet as
7664,THE POET'S RELIGION,"incapable of forming rational theological tenets, because his temper is"
7665,THE POET'S RELIGION,"unspeculative, or at most, carries him no farther than a materialistic"
7666,THE POET'S RELIGION,"philosophy. The puritan condemns the poet as lacking reverence, that is,"
7667,THE POET'S RELIGION,"as having no ""religious instinct."" The plain man, of course, charges the"
7668,THE POET'S RELIGION,"poet, in this particular as in all others, with failure to conform. The"
7669,THE POET'S RELIGION,"poet shows no respect, he avers, for the orthodox beliefs of society."
7670,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7671,THE POET'S RELIGION,The quarrel of the poet and the philosopher has at no time been more in
7672,THE POET'S RELIGION,evidence than at present. The unspeculativeness of contemporary poetry
7673,THE POET'S RELIGION,"is almost a creed. Poets, if they are to be read, must take a solemn"
7674,THE POET'S RELIGION,pledge to confine their range of subject-matter to fleeting impressions
7675,THE POET'S RELIGION,of the world of sense. The quarrel was only less in evidence in the
7676,THE POET'S RELIGION,"period just before the present one, at the time when the cry, ""art for"
7677,THE POET'S RELIGION,"art's sake,"" held the attention of the public. At that time philosophers"
7678,THE POET'S RELIGION,"could point out that Walter Pater, the molder of poet's opinions, had"
7679,THE POET'S RELIGION,"said, ""It is possible that metaphysics may be one of the things which we"
7680,THE POET'S RELIGION,"must renounce, if we would mould our lives to artistic perfection."" This"
7681,THE POET'S RELIGION,"narrowness of interest, this deliberate shutting of one's self up within"
7682,THE POET'S RELIGION,"the confines of the physically appealing, has been believed to be"
7683,THE POET'S RELIGION,characteristic of all poets. The completeness of their satisfaction in
7684,THE POET'S RELIGION,"what has been called ""the aesthetic moment"" is the death of their"
7685,THE POET'S RELIGION,philosophical instincts. The immediate perception of flowers and birds
7686,THE POET'S RELIGION,and breezes is so all-sufficing to them that such phenomena do not send
7687,THE POET'S RELIGION,their minds racing back on a quest of first principles. Thus argue
7688,THE POET'S RELIGION,philosophers.
7689,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7690,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Such a conclusion the poet denies. The philosopher, to whom a"
7691,THE POET'S RELIGION,"sense-impression is a mere needle-prick, useful only as it starts his"
7692,THE POET'S RELIGION,"thoughts off on a tangent from it to the separate world of ideas, is not"
7693,THE POET'S RELIGION,unnaturally misled by the poet's total absorption in the world of sense.
7694,THE POET'S RELIGION,"But the poet is thus absorbed, not, as the philosopher implies, because"
7695,THE POET'S RELIGION,"he denies, or ignores, the existence of ideas, but because he cannot"
7696,THE POET'S RELIGION,conceive of disembodied ideas. Walter Pater's reason for rejecting
7697,THE POET'S RELIGION,philosophy as a handicap to the poet was that philosophy robs the world
7698,THE POET'S RELIGION,"of its sensuousness, as he believed. He explained the conception of"
7699,THE POET'S RELIGION,"philosophy to which he objected, as follows:"
7700,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7701,THE POET'S RELIGION,"To that gaudy tangle of what gardens, after all, are meant"
7702,THE POET'S RELIGION,"to produce, in the decay of time, as we may think at first"
7703,THE POET'S RELIGION,"sight, the systematic, logical gardener put his meddlesome"
7704,THE POET'S RELIGION,"hand, and straightway all ran to seed; to _genus_ and"
7705,THE POET'S RELIGION,"_species_ and _differentia_, into formal classes,"
7706,THE POET'S RELIGION,"under general notions, and with--yes! with written labels"
7707,THE POET'S RELIGION,fluttering on the stalks instead of blossoms--a botanic or
7708,THE POET'S RELIGION,"physic garden, as they used to say, instead of our"
7709,THE POET'S RELIGION,flower-garden and orchard. [Footnote: _Plato and
7710,THE POET'S RELIGION,Platonism._]
7711,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7712,THE POET'S RELIGION,"But it is only against this particular conception of philosophy, which"
7713,THE POET'S RELIGION,"is based upon abstraction of the ideal from the sensual, that the poet"
7714,THE POET'S RELIGION,"demurs. Beside the foregoing view of philosophy expressed by Pater, we"
7715,THE POET'S RELIGION,"may place that of another poet, an adherent, indeed, of one of the most"
7716,THE POET'S RELIGION,"purely sensuous schools of poetry. Arthur Symons states as his belief,"
7717,THE POET'S RELIGION,"""The poet who is not also philosopher is like a flower without a root."
7718,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Both seek the same infinitude; the one apprehending the idea, the other"
7719,THE POET'S RELIGION,"the image."" [Footnote: _The Romantic Movement,_ p. 129.] That is,"
7720,THE POET'S RELIGION,"to the poet, ideality is the hidden life of the sensual."
7721,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7722,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Wherever a dry as dust rationalizing theology is in vogue, it is true"
7723,THE POET'S RELIGION,"that some poets, in their reaction, have gone to the extreme of"
7724,THE POET'S RELIGION,subscribing to a materialistic conception of the universe. Shelley is
7725,THE POET'S RELIGION,the classic example. Everyone is aware of his revulsion from Paley's
7726,THE POET'S RELIGION,"theology, which his father sternly proposed to read aloud to him, and of"
7727,THE POET'S RELIGION,"his noisy championing of the materialistic cause, in _Queen Mab_."
7728,THE POET'S RELIGION,But Shelley is also the best example that might be cited to prove the
7729,THE POET'S RELIGION,incompatibility of materialism and poetry. It might almost be said that
7730,THE POET'S RELIGION,Shelley never wrote a line of genuine poetry while his mind was under
7731,THE POET'S RELIGION,the bondage of materialistic theory. Fortunately Shelley was scarcely
7732,THE POET'S RELIGION,able to hold to the delusion that he was a materialist throughout the
7733,THE POET'S RELIGION,"course of an entire poem, even in his extreme youth. To Shelley, more"
7734,THE POET'S RELIGION,"truly perhaps than to any other poet, the physical world throbs with"
7735,THE POET'S RELIGION,"spiritual life. His materialistic theories, if more loudly vociferated,"
7736,THE POET'S RELIGION,"were of scarcely greater significance than were those of Coleridge, who"
7737,THE POET'S RELIGION,"declared, ""After I had read Voltaire's _Philosophical Dictionary,_"
7738,THE POET'S RELIGION,"I sported infidel, but my infidel vanity never touched my heart."""
7739,THE POET'S RELIGION,"[Footnote: James Gillman, _Life of Coleridge_, p. 23.]"
7740,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7741,THE POET'S RELIGION,A more serious charge of atheism could be brought against the poets at
7742,THE POET'S RELIGION,the other end of the century. John Davidson was a thoroughgoing
7743,THE POET'S RELIGION,"materialist, and the other members of the school, made sceptic by their"
7744,THE POET'S RELIGION,"admiration for the sophistic philosophy of Wilde, followed Davidson in"
7745,THE POET'S RELIGION,his views. But this hardly strengthens the philosopher's charge that
7746,THE POET'S RELIGION,"materialistic philosophy characterizes poets as a class, for the"
7747,THE POET'S RELIGION,curiously limited poetry which the 1890 group produced might lead the
7748,THE POET'S RELIGION,reader to assume that spiritual faith is indispensable to poets. If
7749,THE POET'S RELIGION,"idealistic philosophy, as Arthur Symons asserts, is the root of which"
7750,THE POET'S RELIGION,"poetry is the flower, then the artificial and exotic poetry of the"
7751,THE POET'S RELIGION,"_fin de siècle_ school bears close resemblance to cut flowers,"
7752,THE POET'S RELIGION,already drooping.
7753,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7754,THE POET'S RELIGION,"It is significant that the outstanding materialist among American poets,"
7755,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Poe, produced poetry of much the same artificial temper as did these"
7756,THE POET'S RELIGION,"men. Poe himself was unable to accept, with any degree of complacence,"
7757,THE POET'S RELIGION,the materialistic philosophy which seemed to him the most plausible
7758,THE POET'S RELIGION,explanation of life. One of his best-known sonnets is a threnody for
7759,THE POET'S RELIGION,"poetry which, he feels, is passing away from earth as materialistic"
7760,THE POET'S RELIGION,"views become generally accepted. [Footnote: See the sonnet, _To"
7761,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Science._] Sensuous as was his conception of poetry, he yet felt that"
7762,THE POET'S RELIGION,one kills it in taking the spirit of ideality out of the physical world.
7763,THE POET'S RELIGION,"""I really perceive,"" he wrote in this connection, ""that vanity about"
7764,THE POET'S RELIGION,"which most men merely prate,--the vanity of the human or temporal life."""
7765,THE POET'S RELIGION,"[Footnote: Letter to James Russell Lowell, July 2, 1844.]"
7766,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7767,THE POET'S RELIGION,"It is obvious that atheism, being pure negation, is not congenial to the"
7768,THE POET'S RELIGION,poetical temper. The general rule holds that atheism can exist only
7769,THE POET'S RELIGION,where the reason holds the imagination in bondage. It was not merely the
7770,THE POET'S RELIGION,"horrified recoil of orthodox opinion that prevented Constance Naden, the"
7771,THE POET'S RELIGION,"most voluminous writer of atheistic verse in the last century, from"
7772,THE POET'S RELIGION,"obtaining lasting recognition as a poet. Verse like hers, which"
7773,THE POET'S RELIGION,"expresses mere denial, is not essentially more poetical than blank"
7774,THE POET'S RELIGION,paper.
7775,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7776,THE POET'S RELIGION,One cannot make so sweeping a statement without at once recalling the
7777,THE POET'S RELIGION,"notable exception, James Thompson, B.V., the blackness of whose"
7778,THE POET'S RELIGION,atheistic creed makes up the whole substance of _The City of Dreadful
7779,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Night_. The preacher brings comfort to the tortured men in that poem,"
7780,THE POET'S RELIGION,"with the words,"
7781,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7782,THE POET'S RELIGION,And now at last authentic word I bring
7783,THE POET'S RELIGION,Witnessed by every dead and living thing;
7784,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Good tidings of great joy for you, for all:"
7785,THE POET'S RELIGION,There is no God; no fiend with name divine
7786,THE POET'S RELIGION,Made us and tortures us; if we must pine
7787,THE POET'S RELIGION,It is to satiate no Being's gall.
7788,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7789,THE POET'S RELIGION,But this poem is a pure freak in poetry. Perhaps it might be asserted of
7790,THE POET'S RELIGION,"James Thompson, without too much casuistry, that he was, poetically"
7791,THE POET'S RELIGION,"speaking, not a materialist but a pessimist, and that the strength of"
7792,THE POET'S RELIGION,his poetic gift lay in the thirst of his imagination for an ideal world
7793,THE POET'S RELIGION,in which his reason would not permit him to believe. One cannot say of
7794,THE POET'S RELIGION,"him, as of Coleridge, that ""his unbelief never touched his heart."" It"
7795,THE POET'S RELIGION,would be nearer the truth to say that his unbelief broke his heart.
7796,THE POET'S RELIGION,Thomson himself would be the first to admit that his vision of the City
7797,THE POET'S RELIGION,"of Dreadful Night is inferior, as poetry, to the visions of William"
7798,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Blake in the same city, of whom Thomson writes with a certain wistful"
7799,THE POET'S RELIGION,"envy,"
7800,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7801,THE POET'S RELIGION,"He came to the desert of London town,"
7802,THE POET'S RELIGION,Mirk miles broad;
7803,THE POET'S RELIGION,"He wandered up and he wandered down,"
7804,THE POET'S RELIGION,Ever alone with God.
7805,THE POET'S RELIGION,[Footnote: _William Blake._]
7806,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7807,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Goethe speaks of the poet's impressions of the outer world, the inner"
7808,THE POET'S RELIGION,world and the other world. To the poet these impressions cannot be
7809,THE POET'S RELIGION,"distinct, but must be fused in every aesthetic experience. In his"
7810,THE POET'S RELIGION,"impressions of the physical world he finds, not merely the reflection of"
7811,THE POET'S RELIGION,"his own personality, but the germ of infinite spiritual meaning, and it"
7812,THE POET'S RELIGION,is the balance of the three elements which creates for him the
7813,THE POET'S RELIGION,"""aesthetic repose."""
7814,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7815,THE POET'S RELIGION,Even in the peculiarly limited sensuous verse of the present the third
7816,THE POET'S RELIGION,"element is implicit. Other poets, no less than Joyce Kilmer, have a dim"
7817,THE POET'S RELIGION,sense that in their physical experiences they are really tasting the
7818,THE POET'S RELIGION,"eucharist, as Kilmer indicates in his warning,"
7819,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7820,THE POET'S RELIGION,Vain is his voice in whom no longer dwells
7821,THE POET'S RELIGION,Hunger that craves immortal bread and wine.
7822,THE POET'S RELIGION,[Footnote: _Poets._]
7823,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7824,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Very dim, indeed, it may be, the sense is, yet in almost every"
7825,THE POET'S RELIGION,"verse-writer of to-day there crops out, now and then, a conviction of"
7826,THE POET'S RELIGION,"the mystic significance of the physical. [Footnote: See, for example,"
7827,THE POET'S RELIGION,"John Masefield, _Prayer,_ and _The Seekers;_ and William Rose Benét,"
7828,THE POET'S RELIGION,_The Falconer of God._] To cite the most extreme example of a rugged
7829,THE POET'S RELIGION,persistence of the spiritual life in the truncated poetry of the
7830,THE POET'S RELIGION,"present, even Carl Sandburg cannot escape the conclusion that his"
7831,THE POET'S RELIGION,birds are
7832,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7833,THE POET'S RELIGION,Summer-saulting for God's sake.
7834,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7835,THE POET'S RELIGION,Only the poet seems to possess the secret of the fusion of sense and
7836,THE POET'S RELIGION,"spirit in the world. To the average eye sense-objects are opaque, or, at"
7837,THE POET'S RELIGION,"best, transmit only a faint glimmering of an idea. To Dr. Thomas"
7838,THE POET'S RELIGION,Arnold's mind Wordsworth's concern with the flower which brought
7839,THE POET'S RELIGION,"""thoughts which do often lie too deep for tears"" was ridiculously"
7840,THE POET'S RELIGION,"excessive, since, at most, a flower could be only the accidental cause"
7841,THE POET'S RELIGION,"of great thoughts, a push, as it were, that started into activity ideas"
7842,THE POET'S RELIGION,"which afterward ran on by their own impulsion. Tennyson has indicated,"
7843,THE POET'S RELIGION,"however, that the poetical feeling aroused by a flower is, in its utmost"
7844,THE POET'S RELIGION,"reaches, no more than a recognition of that which actually abides in the"
7845,THE POET'S RELIGION,"flower itself. He muses,"
7846,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7847,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Flower in the crannied wall,"
7848,THE POET'S RELIGION,I pluck you out of the crannies;--
7849,THE POET'S RELIGION,"I hold you here, root and all, in my hand,"
7850,THE POET'S RELIGION,Little flower--but if I could understand
7851,THE POET'S RELIGION,"What you are, root and all and all in all,"
7852,THE POET'S RELIGION,I should know what God and man is.
7853,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7854,THE POET'S RELIGION,By whatever polysyllabic name the more consciously speculative poets
7855,THE POET'S RELIGION,"designate their philosophical creed, this belief in the infinite meaning"
7856,THE POET'S RELIGION,"of every object in the physical world is pure pantheism, and the"
7857,THE POET'S RELIGION,instinctive poetical religion is inevitably a pantheistic one. All
7858,THE POET'S RELIGION,"poetical metaphor is a confession of this fact, for in metaphor the"
7859,THE POET'S RELIGION,sensuous and the spiritual are conceived as one.
7860,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7861,THE POET'S RELIGION,A pantheistic religion is the only one which does not hamper the poet's
7862,THE POET'S RELIGION,unconscious and unhampering morality. He refuses to die to this world as
7863,THE POET'S RELIGION,Plato's philosopher and the early fathers of the church were urged to
7864,THE POET'S RELIGION,"do, for it is from the physical world that all his inspiration comes. If"
7865,THE POET'S RELIGION,"he attempts to turn away from it, he is bewildered, as Christina"
7866,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Rossetti was, by a duality in his nature, by"
7867,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7868,THE POET'S RELIGION,The foolishest fond folly of a heart
7869,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Divided, neither here nor there at rest,"
7870,THE POET'S RELIGION,"That hankers after Heaven, but clings to earth."
7871,THE POET'S RELIGION,"[Footnote: _Later Life,_ Sonnet 24.]"
7872,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7873,THE POET'S RELIGION,"On the other hand, if he tries to content himself with the merely"
7874,THE POET'S RELIGION,"physical aspects of things, he finds that he cannot crush out of his"
7875,THE POET'S RELIGION,nature a mysticism quite as intense as that of the most ascetic saint.
7876,THE POET'S RELIGION,Only a religion which maintains the all-pervasive oneness of both
7877,THE POET'S RELIGION,elements in his nature can wholly satisfy him.
7878,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7879,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Not infrequently, poets have given this instinctive faith of theirs a"
7880,THE POET'S RELIGION,"conscious formulation. Coleridge, with his indefatigable quest of the"
7881,THE POET'S RELIGION,"unity underlying ""the Objective and Subjective,"" did so. Shelley devoted"
7882,THE POET'S RELIGION,a large part of _Prometheus Unbound_ and the conclusion of _Adonais_ to
7883,THE POET'S RELIGION,his pantheistic views. Wordsworth never wavered in his worship of the
7884,THE POET'S RELIGION,"sense world which was yet spiritual,"
7885,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7886,THE POET'S RELIGION,"The Being that is in the clouds and air,"
7887,THE POET'S RELIGION,"That is in the green leaves among the groves,"
7888,THE POET'S RELIGION,[Footnote: _Hart Leap Well._]
7889,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7890,THE POET'S RELIGION,"and was led to the conclusion,"
7891,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7892,THE POET'S RELIGION,It is my faith that every flower
7893,THE POET'S RELIGION,Enjoys the air it breathes.
7894,THE POET'S RELIGION,[Footnote: _Lines Written in Early Spring._]
7895,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7896,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Tennyson, despite the restlessness of his speculative temper, was ever"
7897,THE POET'S RELIGION,returning to a pantheistic creed. The same is true of the Brownings.
7898,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Arnold is, of course, undecided upon the question, and now approves, now"
7899,THE POET'S RELIGION,rejects the pessimistic view of pantheism expressed in _Empedocles on
7900,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Ætna,_ in accordance with his change of mood putting the poem in and"
7901,THE POET'S RELIGION,out of the various editions of his works. But wherever his poetry is
7902,THE POET'S RELIGION,"most worthy, his worship of nature coincides with Wordsworth's"
7903,THE POET'S RELIGION,pantheistic faith. Swinburne's _Hertha_ is one of the most thorough
7904,THE POET'S RELIGION,"going expressions of pantheism. At the present time, as in much"
7905,THE POET'S RELIGION,"of the poetry of the past, the pantheistic feeling is merely implicit."
7906,THE POET'S RELIGION,One of the most recent conscious formulations of it is in Le Gallienne's
7907,THE POET'S RELIGION,"_Natural Religion,_ wherein he explains the grounds of his faith,"
7908,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7909,THE POET'S RELIGION,Up through the mystic deeps of sunny air
7910,THE POET'S RELIGION,"I cried to God, ""Oh Father, art thou there?"""
7911,THE POET'S RELIGION,Sudden the answer like a flute I heard;
7912,THE POET'S RELIGION,"It was an angel, though it seemed a bird."
7913,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7914,THE POET'S RELIGION,On the whole the poet might well wax indignant over the philosopher's
7915,THE POET'S RELIGION,charge. It is hardly fair to accuse the poet of being indifferent to the
7916,THE POET'S RELIGION,"realm of ideas, when, as a matter of fact, he not only tries to"
7917,THE POET'S RELIGION,"establish himself there, but to carry everything else in the universe"
7918,THE POET'S RELIGION,with him.
7919,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7920,THE POET'S RELIGION,The charge of the puritan appears no more just to the poet than that of
7921,THE POET'S RELIGION,"the philosopher. How can it be true, as the puritan maintains it to be,"
7922,THE POET'S RELIGION,"that the poet lacks the spirit of reverence, when he is constantly"
7923,THE POET'S RELIGION,incurring the ridicule of the world by the awe with which he regards
7924,THE POET'S RELIGION,"himself and his creations? No power, poets aver, is stronger to awaken a"
7925,THE POET'S RELIGION,religious mood than is the quietude of the beauty which they worship.
7926,THE POET'S RELIGION,Wordsworth says that poetry can never be felt or rightly estimated
7927,THE POET'S RELIGION,"""without love of human nature and reverence for God,"" [Footnote: Letter"
7928,THE POET'S RELIGION,"to Lady Beaumont, May 21, 1807.] because poetry and religion are of the"

7930,THE POET'S RELIGION,"poetry, and both derive the harmony and repose that inspire reverence"
7931,THE POET'S RELIGION,from this power of revelation.
7932,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7933,THE POET'S RELIGION,"But, the puritan objects, the overweening pride which is one of the"
7934,THE POET'S RELIGION,poet's most distinctive traits renders impossible the humility of spirit
7935,THE POET'S RELIGION,characteristic of religious reverence.
7936,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7937,THE POET'S RELIGION,It is true that the poet repudiates a religion that humbles him; this is
7938,THE POET'S RELIGION,one of the strongest reasons for his pantheistic leanings.

7944,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Swinburne represents nature as crying to man, and this suits the poet"
7945,THE POET'S RELIGION,exactly. Perhaps Swinburne's prose shows more clearly than his poetry
7946,THE POET'S RELIGION,the divergence of the puritan temper and the poetical one in the matter
7947,THE POET'S RELIGION,"of religious humility. ""We who worship no material incarnation of any"
7948,THE POET'S RELIGION,"qualities,"" he wrote, ""no person, may worship the Divine Humanity; the"
7949,THE POET'S RELIGION,"ideal of human perfection and aspiration, without worshipping any god,"
7950,THE POET'S RELIGION,"any person, any fetish at all. Therefore I might call myself, if I"
7951,THE POET'S RELIGION,"wished, a kind of Christian (of the Church of Blake and Shelley) but"
7952,THE POET'S RELIGION,"assuredly in no sense a theist."" [Footnote: Edmund Gosse, _Swinburne_,"

7954,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7955,THE POET'S RELIGION,Nothing less than complete fusion of the three worlds spoken of by
7956,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Goethe, will satisfy the poet. If fusion of the outer world and the"
7957,THE POET'S RELIGION,"other world results in the pantheistic color of the poet's religion, the"
7958,THE POET'S RELIGION,"third element, the inner world, makes it imperative that the poet's"
7959,THE POET'S RELIGION,"divinity should be a personal one, no less, in fact, than a deification"
7960,THE POET'S RELIGION,of his own nature. This tendency of the poet to create God in his own
7961,THE POET'S RELIGION,"image is frankly acknowledged by Mrs. Browning in prayer to the ""Poet"

7963,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7964,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Of all English writers, William Blake affords the clearest revelation of"
7965,THE POET'S RELIGION,"the poet's instinctive attitude, because he is most courageous in"
7966,THE POET'S RELIGION,carrying the implications of poetic egotism to their logical conclusion.
7967,THE POET'S RELIGION,"In the _Prophetic Books_, in particular, Blake boldly expresses all"
7968,THE POET'S RELIGION,that is implicit in the poet's yearning for a religion which will not
7969,THE POET'S RELIGION,"humble and thwart his nature, but will exalt and magnify it."
7970,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7971,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Even the puritan cannot affirm that the poet's demand for recognition,"
7972,THE POET'S RELIGION,"in his religious belief, of every phase of his existence, has not"
7973,THE POET'S RELIGION,"flowered, once, at least, in most genuinely religious poetry, for the"

7987,THE POET'S RELIGION,"There remains the plain man to be dealt with. What, he reiterates, has"
7988,THE POET'S RELIGION,the poet to say for his orthodoxy? If he can combine his poetical
7989,THE POET'S RELIGION,illusions about the divinity of nature and the superlative and awesome
7990,THE POET'S RELIGION,importance of the poet himself with regular attendance at church; if
7991,THE POET'S RELIGION,these phantasies do not prevent him from sincerely and thoughtfully
7992,THE POET'S RELIGION,"repeating the Apostle's creed, well and good. The plain man's religious"
7993,THE POET'S RELIGION,"demands upon the poet are really not excessive, yet the poet, from the"
7994,THE POET'S RELIGION,"romantic period onward, has taken delight in scandalizing him."
7995,THE POET'S RELIGION,
7996,THE POET'S RELIGION,In the eighteenth century poets seem not to have been averse to
7997,THE POET'S RELIGION,placating their enemies by publishing their attendance upon the
7998,THE POET'S RELIGION,"appointed means of grace. Among the more conservative poets, this"
7999,THE POET'S RELIGION,attitude lasted over into the earlier stages of the romantic movement.
8000,THE POET'S RELIGION,"So late a poet as Bowles delighted to stress the ""churchman's ardor"" of"
8001,THE POET'S RELIGION,the poet. [Footnote: See his verse on Southey and Milton.] Southey also
8002,THE POET'S RELIGION,was ready to exhibit his punctilious orthodoxy. Yet poor Southey was the
8003,THE POET'S RELIGION,"unwitting cause of the impiety of his brothers for many years, inasmuch"
8004,THE POET'S RELIGION,"as Byron's _A Vision of Judgment,_ with its irresistible satire on"
8005,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Southey, sounded the death-knell of the narrowly religious poet."
8006,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8007,THE POET'S RELIGION,The vogue which the poet of religious ill-repute enjoyed during the
8008,THE POET'S RELIGION,"romantic period was, of course, a very natural phase of ""the renaissance"
8009,THE POET'S RELIGION,"of wonder."" The religious ""correctness"" of the eighteenth century"
8010,THE POET'S RELIGION,"inevitably went out of fashion, in poetic circles, along with the rest"
8011,THE POET'S RELIGION,of its formalism. Poets vied with one another in forming new and daring
8012,THE POET'S RELIGION,"conceptions of God. There was no question, in the romantic revolt, of"
8013,THE POET'S RELIGION,"yielding to genuine atheism. ""The worst of it is that I _do_ believe,"""
8014,THE POET'S RELIGION,"said Byron, discussing his bravery under fear of death. ""Anything but"
8015,THE POET'S RELIGION,"the Church of England,"" was the attitude by which Byron shocked the"
8016,THE POET'S RELIGION,"orthodox. ""I think,"" he wrote, ""people can never have enough of"
8017,THE POET'S RELIGION,"religion, if they are to have any. I incline myself very much to the"
8018,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Catholic doctrine."" [Footnote: Letter to Tom Moore, March 4, 1822. See"
8019,THE POET'S RELIGION,"also the letter to Robert Charles Dallas, January 21, 1808.] _Cain,_"
8020,THE POET'S RELIGION,"however, is not a piece of Catholic propaganda, and the chief"
8021,THE POET'S RELIGION,significance of Byron's religious poetry lies in his romantic delight in
8022,THE POET'S RELIGION,arraigning the Almighty as well as Episcopalians.
8023,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8024,THE POET'S RELIGION,Shelley comes out even more squarely than Byron against conventional
8025,THE POET'S RELIGION,"religion. In _Julian and Maddalo_, he causes Byron to say of him,"
8026,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8027,THE POET'S RELIGION,You were ever still
8028,THE POET'S RELIGION,Among Christ's flock a perilous infidel.
8029,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8030,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Shelley helped to foster the tradition, too, that the poet was"
8031,THE POET'S RELIGION,"persecuted by the church. In _Rosalind and Helen_, the hero was"
8032,THE POET'S RELIGION,"hated by the clergy,"
8033,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8034,THE POET'S RELIGION,For he made verses wild and queer
8035,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Of the strange creeds priests hold so dear,"
8036,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8037,THE POET'S RELIGION,and this predilection for making them wild and queer resulted in

8043,THE POET'S RELIGION,"For he, they said, from his mind had bent"
8044,THE POET'S RELIGION,Against their gods keen blasphemy.
8045,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8046,THE POET'S RELIGION,The most notable illustration of this phase of Shelley's thought is
8047,THE POET'S RELIGION,"_The Revolt of Islam,_ wherein the poets, Laon and Cythna, are put"
8048,THE POET'S RELIGION,"to death by the priests, who regard them as their worst enemies."
8049,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8050,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Burns, also, took a certain pleasure in unorthodoxy, and later poets"
8051,THE POET'S RELIGION,have gloried in his attitude.
8052,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8053,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Swinburne, in particular, praises his daring, in that he"

8057,THE POET'S RELIGION,[Footnote: _Burns._]
8058,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8059,THE POET'S RELIGION,Young poets have not yet lost their taste for religious persecution. It
8060,THE POET'S RELIGION,is a great disappointment to them to find it difficult to strike fire
8061,THE POET'S RELIGION,from the faithful in these days. Swinburne in his early poetry denounced
8062,THE POET'S RELIGION,the orthodox God with such vigor that he roused a momentary flutter of
8063,THE POET'S RELIGION,"horror in the church, but nowadays the young poet who craves to manifest"
8064,THE POET'S RELIGION,his spiritual daring is far more likely to find himself in the position
8065,THE POET'S RELIGION,"of Rupert Brooke, of whom someone has said, ""He imagines the poet as"
8066,THE POET'S RELIGION,"going on a magnificent quest to curse God on his throne of fire, and"
8067,THE POET'S RELIGION,"finding--nothing."""
8068,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8069,THE POET'S RELIGION,"The poet's youthful zest in scandalizing the orthodox is likely,"
8070,THE POET'S RELIGION,"however, to be early outgrown. As the difficulties in the way of his"
8071,THE POET'S RELIGION,"finding a God worthy of his adoration become manifest to him, it may be,"
8072,THE POET'S RELIGION,"indeed, with a sigh that he turns from the conventional religion in"
8073,THE POET'S RELIGION,"which so many men find certitude and place. This is the mood,"
8074,THE POET'S RELIGION,"frequently, of Browning, [Footnote: See _Christmas Eve_ and _Easter"
8075,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Day._] of Tennyson, [Footnote: See _In Memoriam._] of Arnold, [Footnote:"
8076,THE POET'S RELIGION,"See _Dover Beach._] of Clough. [Footnote: See _The New Sinai, Qui"
8077,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Laborat Orat, Hymnos Amnos, Epistrausium._] So, too, James Thomson muses"
8078,THE POET'S RELIGION,"with regret,"
8079,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8080,THE POET'S RELIGION,"How sweet to enter in, to kneel and pray"
8081,THE POET'S RELIGION,With all the others whom we love so well!
8082,THE POET'S RELIGION,"All disbelief and doubt might pass away,"
8083,THE POET'S RELIGION,And peace float to us with its Sabbath bell.
8084,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Conscience replies, There is but one good rest,"
8085,THE POET'S RELIGION,Whose head is pillowed upon Truth's pure breast.
8086,THE POET'S RELIGION,[Footnote: _The Reclusant._]
8087,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8088,THE POET'S RELIGION,"In fact, as the religious world grows more broad-minded, the mature poet"
8089,THE POET'S RELIGION,sometimes appeals to the orthodox for sympathy when his daring religious
8090,THE POET'S RELIGION,questing threatens to plunge him into despair. The public is too quick
8091,THE POET'S RELIGION,"to class him with those whose doubt is owing to lassitude of mind,"
8092,THE POET'S RELIGION,rather than too eager activity. Tennyson is obliged to remind his
8093,THE POET'S RELIGION,"contemporaries,"
8094,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8095,THE POET'S RELIGION,"There lives more faith in honest doubt,"
8096,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Believe me, than in half the creeds."
8097,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8098,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Browning, as always, takes a hopeful view of human stupidity when he"
8099,THE POET'S RELIGION,"expresses his belief that men will not long ""persist in confounding, any"
8100,THE POET'S RELIGION,"more than God confounds, with genuine infidelity and atheism of the"
8101,THE POET'S RELIGION,heart those passionate impatient struggles of a boy toward truth and
8102,THE POET'S RELIGION,"love."" [Footnote: _Preface_ to the Letters of Shelley (afterwards"
8103,THE POET'S RELIGION,proved spurious).]
8104,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8105,THE POET'S RELIGION,The reluctance of the world to give honor too freely to the poet who
8106,THE POET'S RELIGION,"prefers solitary doubt to common faith is, probably enough, due to a"
8107,THE POET'S RELIGION,shrewd suspicion that the poet finds religious perplexity a very
8108,THE POET'S RELIGION,satisfactory poetic stimulus. In his character as man of religion as in
8109,THE POET'S RELIGION,"that of lover, the poet is apt to feel that his thirst, not the"
8110,THE POET'S RELIGION,"quenching of it, is the aesthetic experience. There is not much question"
8111,THE POET'S RELIGION,"that since the beginning of the romantic movement, at least, religious"
8112,THE POET'S RELIGION,doubt has been more prolific of poetry than religious certainty has
8113,THE POET'S RELIGION,"been. Even Cowper, most orthodox of poets, composed his best religious"
8114,THE POET'S RELIGION,poetry while he was tortured by doubt. One does not deny that there is
8115,THE POET'S RELIGION,"good poetry in the hymn books, expressing settled faith, but no one will"
8116,THE POET'S RELIGION,"seriously contend, I suppose, that any contentedly orthodox poet of the"
8117,THE POET'S RELIGION,"last century has given us a body of verse that compares favorably, in"
8118,THE POET'S RELIGION,"purely poetical merit, with that of Arnold."
8119,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8120,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Against the imputation that he deliberately dallies with doubt, the poet"
8121,THE POET'S RELIGION,"can only reply that, again as in the case of his human loves, longing is"
8122,THE POET'S RELIGION,"strong enough to spur him to poetic achievement, only when it is a"
8123,THE POET'S RELIGION,"thirst driving him mad with its intensity. The poet, in the words of a"
8124,THE POET'S RELIGION,"recent poem, is ""homesick after God,"" and in the period of his blackest"
8125,THE POET'S RELIGION,"doubt beats against the wall of his reason with the cry,"
8126,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8127,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Ah, but there should be one!"
8128,THE POET'S RELIGION,There should be one. And there's the bitterness
8129,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Of this unending torture-place for men,"
8130,THE POET'S RELIGION,For the proud soul that craves a perfectness
8131,THE POET'S RELIGION,That might outwear the rotting of all things
8132,THE POET'S RELIGION,Rooted in earth.
8133,THE POET'S RELIGION,"[Footnote: Josephine Preston Peabody, _Marlowe._]"
8134,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8135,THE POET'S RELIGION,The public which refuses to credit the poet with earnestness in his
8136,THE POET'S RELIGION,quest of God may misconceive the dignified attempts of Arnold to free
8137,THE POET'S RELIGION,"himself from the tangle of doubt, and deem his beautiful gestures"
8138,THE POET'S RELIGION,"purposely futile, but before condemning the poetic attitude toward"
8139,THE POET'S RELIGION,religion it must also take into account the contrary disposition of
8140,THE POET'S RELIGION,Browning to kick his way out of difficulties with entire indifference to
8141,THE POET'S RELIGION,the greater dignity of an attitude of resignation; and no more than
8142,THE POET'S RELIGION,Arnold does Browning ever depict a poet who achieves religious
8143,THE POET'S RELIGION,satisfaction. Thus the hero of _Pauline_ comes to no triumphant
8144,THE POET'S RELIGION,"issue, though he maintains,"
8145,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8146,THE POET'S RELIGION,I have always had one lode-star; now
8147,THE POET'S RELIGION,"As I look back, I see that I have halted"
8148,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Or hastened as I looked towards that star,"

8150,THE POET'S RELIGION,

8165,THE POET'S RELIGION,What utter need!
8166,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8167,THE POET'S RELIGION,"There is, after all, small need that the public should charge the poet"
8168,THE POET'S RELIGION,with deliberate failure to gain a satisfactory view of the deity. The
8169,THE POET'S RELIGION,quest of a God who satisfies the poet's demand that He shall include all
8170,THE POET'S RELIGION,"life, satisfy every impulse, be as personal as the poet himself, and"
8171,THE POET'S RELIGION,"embody only the harmony of beauty, is bound to be a long one. It appears"
8172,THE POET'S RELIGION,inevitable that the poet should never get more than incomplete and

8188,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8189,THE POET'S RELIGION,If the poet's independent quest of God is doomed to no more successful
8190,THE POET'S RELIGION,"issue than this, it might seem advisable for him to tolerate the"

8204,THE POET'S RELIGION,[Footnote: _Soothsay._]
8205,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8206,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Indeed, many of the lesser poets have capitulated to overtures of"
8207,THE POET'S RELIGION,tolerance and not-too-curious inquiry into their private beliefs on the
8208,THE POET'S RELIGION,part of the church.
8209,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8210,THE POET'S RELIGION,"In America, the land of religious tolerance, the poet's break with"
8211,THE POET'S RELIGION,"thechurch was never so serious as in England, and the shifting creeds of"
8212,THE POET'S RELIGION,"the evangelical churches have not much hampered poets. In fact, the"
8213,THE POET'S RELIGION,frenzy of the poet and of the revivalist have sometimes been felt as
8214,THE POET'S RELIGION,"akin. Noteworthy in this connection is George Lansing Raymond, who"
8215,THE POET'S RELIGION,"causes the heroes of two pretentious narrative poems, _A Life in Song,_"
8216,THE POET'S RELIGION,"and _The Real and the Ideal,_ to begin by being poets, and end by"
8217,THE POET'S RELIGION,becoming ministers of the gospel. The verse of J. G. Holland is hardly
8218,THE POET'S RELIGION,less to the point. The poet-hero of Holland's _Bitter Sweet_ is a
8219,THE POET'S RELIGION,"thoroughgoing evangelist, who, in the stress of temptation by a woman"
8220,THE POET'S RELIGION,"who would seduce him, falls upon his knees and saves his own soul and"
8221,THE POET'S RELIGION,"hers likewise. In _Kathrina,_ though the hero, rebellious on account of"
8222,THE POET'S RELIGION,"the suicide of his demented parents, remains agnostic till almost the"
8223,THE POET'S RELIGION,"end of the poem, this is clearly regarded by Holland as the cause of his"
8224,THE POET'S RELIGION,"incomplete success as a poet, and in the end the hero becomes an"
8225,THE POET'S RELIGION,irreproachable churchman. At present Vachel Lindsay keeps up the
8226,THE POET'S RELIGION,tradition of the poet-revivalist.
8227,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8228,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Even in England, the orthodox poet has not been nonexistent. Christina"
8229,THE POET'S RELIGION,Rossetti portrays such an one in her autobiographical poetry. Jean
8230,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Ingelow, in _Letters of Life and Morning_, offers most conventional"
8231,THE POET'S RELIGION,religious advice to the young poet. And in Coventry Patmore's _The
8232,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Angel in the House_, one finds as orthodox a poet as any that the"
8233,THE POET'S RELIGION,eighteenth century could afford.
8234,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8235,THE POET'S RELIGION,"The Catholic church too has some grounds for its title, ""nursing mother"
8236,THE POET'S RELIGION,"of poets."" The rise of the group of Catholic poets, Francis Thompson,"
8237,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Alice Meynell, and Lionel Johnson, in particular, has tended to give a"
8238,THE POET'S RELIGION,"more religious cast to the recent poet. If Joyce Kilmer had lived,"
8239,THE POET'S RELIGION,perhaps verse on the Catholic poet would have been even more in

8245,THE POET'S RELIGION,"28, 1918, _Joyce Kilmer: Poems, Essays and Letters_, ed. Robert"
8246,THE POET'S RELIGION,Cortes Holliday.] But Kilmer went much farther and advocated the
8247,THE POET'S RELIGION,"suppression of all writings, by Catholics, which did not specifically"
8248,THE POET'S RELIGION,advertise their author's Catholicism. [Footnote: See his letter to Aline
8249,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Kilmer, April 21, 1918, _Joyce Kilmer, Poems, Essays and Letters_,"
8250,THE POET'S RELIGION,ed. Robert Cortes Holliday.] And such a doctrine immediately delivers
8251,THE POET'S RELIGION,the poet's freedom of inspiration into the hands of censors.
8252,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8253,THE POET'S RELIGION,Perhaps a history of art would not square with the repugnance one feels
8254,THE POET'S RELIGION,toward such censorship. Conformance to the religious beliefs of his time
8255,THE POET'S RELIGION,"certainly does not seem to have handicapped Homer or Dante, to say"
8256,THE POET'S RELIGION,"nothing of the preëminent men in other fields of art, Phidias, Michael"
8257,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Angelo, Raphael, etc. Yet in the modern consciousness, the theory of art"
8258,THE POET'S RELIGION,for art's sake has become so far established that we feel that any
8259,THE POET'S RELIGION,compromise of the purely aesthetic standard is a loss to the artist. The
8260,THE POET'S RELIGION,"deity of the artist and the churchman may be in some measure the same,"
8261,THE POET'S RELIGION,since absolute beauty and absolute goodness are regarded both by poets
8262,THE POET'S RELIGION,"and theologians as identical, but there is reason to believe that the"
8263,THE POET'S RELIGION,poet may not go so far astray if he cleaves to his own immediate
8264,THE POET'S RELIGION,apprehension of absolute beauty as he will if he fashions his beliefs
8265,THE POET'S RELIGION,upon another man's stereotyped conception of the absolute good.
8266,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8267,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Then, too, it is not unlikely that part of the poet's reluctance to"
8268,THE POET'S RELIGION,"embrace the creed of his contemporaries arises from the fact that he, in"
8269,THE POET'S RELIGION,"his secret heart, still hankers for his old title of priest. He knows"
8270,THE POET'S RELIGION,that it is the imaginative faculty of the poet that has been largely
8271,THE POET'S RELIGION,instrumental in building up every religious system. The system that
8272,THE POET'S RELIGION,holds sway in society is apt to be the one that he himself has just
8273,THE POET'S RELIGION,"outgrown; he has, accordingly, an artist's impatience for its"
8274,THE POET'S RELIGION,immaturity. There is much truth to the poet's nature in verses entitled
8275,THE POET'S RELIGION,_The Idol Maker Prays_:
8276,THE POET'S RELIGION,
8277,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Grant thou, that when my art hath made thee known"
8278,THE POET'S RELIGION,"And others bow, I shall not worship thee,"
8279,THE POET'S RELIGION,"But as I pray thee now, then let me pray"
8280,THE POET'S RELIGION,"Some greater god,--like thee to be conceived"
8281,THE POET'S RELIGION,Within my soul.

8290,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8291,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8292,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"No matter how strong our affection for the ingratiating ne'er-do-well,"
8293,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,there are certain charges against the poet which we cannot ignore. It is
8294,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"a serious thing to have an alleged madman, inebriate, and experimenter"
8295,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,in crime running loose in society. But there comes a time when our
8296,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,patience with his indefatigable accusers is exhausted. Is not society
8297,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"going a step too far if, after the poet's positive faults have been"
8298,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"exhausted, it institutes a trial for his sins of omission? Yet so it is."
8299,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,If the poet succeeds in proving to the satisfaction of the jury that his
8300,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"influence is innocuous, he must yet hear the gruff decision, ""Perhaps,"
8301,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"as you say, you are doing no real harm. But of what possible use are"
8302,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"you? Either become an efficient member of society, or cease to exist."""
8303,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Must we tamely look on, while the ""light, winged, and holy creature,"" as"
8304,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Plato called the poet, is harnessed to a truck wagon, and made to"
8305,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,deliver the world's bread and butter? Would that it were more common for
8306,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"poets openly to defy society's demands for efficiency, as certain"
8307,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,children and malaperts of the poetic world have done! It is pleasant to
8308,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"hear the naughty advice which that especially impractical poet, Emily"
8309,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Dickinson, gave to a child: ""Be sure to live in vain, dear. I wish I"
8310,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"had."" [Footnote: Gamaliel Bradford, _Portraits of American Women_,"
8311,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"p. 248 (Mrs. Bianchi, p. 37).] And one is hardly less pleased to hear"
8312,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"the irrepressible Ezra Pound instruct his songs,"
8313,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8314,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"But above all, go to practical people, go, jangle their door-bells."
8315,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Say that you do no work, and that you will live forever."
8316,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _Salutation the Second_.]
8317,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8318,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Surely no one else has had so bad a time with efficiency experts as has
8319,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"the poet, even though everyone whose occupation does not bring out sweat"
8320,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"on the brow is likely to fall under their displeasure. The scholar, for"
8321,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"instance, is given no rest from their querulous complaints, because he"
8322,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"has been sitting at his ease, with a book in his hand, while they have"
8323,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,dug the potatoes for his dinner. But the poet is the object of even
8324,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"bitterer vituperation. He, they remind him, does not even trouble to"
8325,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"maintain a decorous posture during his fits of idleness. Instead, he is"
8326,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"often discovered flat on his back in the grass, with one foot swinging"
8327,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"aloft, wagging defiance at an industrious world. What right has he to"
8328,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"loaf and invite his soul, while the world goes to ruin all about him?"
8329,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8330,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,The poet reacts variously to these attacks. Sometimes with (it must be
8331,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"confessed) aggravating meekness, he seconds all that his beraters say of"
8332,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,his idle ways. [Footnote: For verse dealing with the idle poet see James
8333,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Thomson, _The Castle of Indolence_ (Stanzas about Samuel Patterson, Dr."
8334,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Armstrong, and the author); Barry Cornwall, _The Poet and the Fisher_,"
8335,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,and _Epistle to Charles Lamb on His Emancipation from the Clerkship_;
8336,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Wordsworth, _Expostulation and Reply_; Emerson, _Apology_; Whitman,"

8340,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"_Oneata_; J. G. Neihardt, _The Poet's Town_.] Sometimes he gives them"
8341,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,the plaintive assurance that he is overtaxed with imaginary work. But
8342,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"occasionally he seems to be really stung by their reproaches, and tries"
8343,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,to convince them that by following a strenuous avocation he has done his
8344,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"bit for society, and has earned his hours of idleness as a poet."
8345,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8346,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,When the modern poet tries to establish his point by exhibiting singers
8347,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"laboring in the business and professional world, he cannot be said to"
8348,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,make out a very good case for himself. He has dressed an occasional
8349,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"fictional bard in a clergyman's coat, in memory, possibly, of Donne and"
8350,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Herbert. [Footnote: See G. L. Raymond, _A Life in Song_, and _The Real"
8351,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"and the Ideal_.] In politics, he has exhibited in his verses only a few"
8352,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"scattered figures,--Lucan, [Footnote: See _Nero_, Robert Bridges.]"
8353,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Petrarch, [Footnote: See Landor, _Giovanna of Naples_, and _Andrea of"
8354,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Hungary_.]  Dante, [Footnote: See G. L. Raymond, _Dante_.]  Boccaccio,"
8355,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Walter Map, [Footnote: See _A Becket_, Tennyson.]  Milton [Footnote: See"
8356,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"_Milton_, Bulwer Lytton; _Milton_, George Meredith.]--and these, he must"
8357,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"admit, belong to remote periods. Does D'Annunzio bring the"
8358,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,poet-politician down to the present? But poets have not yet begun to
8359,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"celebrate D'Annunzio in verse. Really there is only one figure, a"
8360,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"protean one, in the realm of practical life, to whom the poet may look"
8361,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,to save his reputation. Shakespeare he is privileged to represent as
8362,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"following many callings, and adorning them all. Or no, not quite all,"
8363,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,for a recent verse-writer has gone to the length of representing
8364,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Shakespeare as a pedagogue, and in this profession the master dramatist"
8365,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"is either inept, or three centuries in advance of his time, for the"
8366,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,citizens of Stratford do not take kindly to his scholastic innovations.
8367,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"[Footnote: See _William Shakespeare, Pedagogue and Poacher_, a drama,"
8368,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Richard Garnett.]
8369,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8370,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"If the poet does not appear a brilliant figure in the business world, he"
8371,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,may turn to another field with the confidence that here his race will
8372,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,vindicate him from the world's charges of sluggishness or weakness. He
8373,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"is wont proudly to declare, with Joyce Kilmer,"
8374,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8375,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,When you say of the making of ballads and songs that it is a woman's
8376,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"work,"
8377,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,You forget all the fighting poets that have been in every land.
8378,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"There was Byron, who left all his lady-loves, to fight against the"
8379,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Turk,"
8380,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"And David, the singing king of the Jews, who was born with a sword"
8381,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,in his hand.
8382,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"It was yesterday that Rupert Brooke went out to the wars and died,"
8383,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,And Sir Philip Sidney's lyric voice was as sweet as his arm was
8384,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"strong,"
8385,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"And Sir Walter Raleigh met the axe as a lover meets his bride,"
8386,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Because he carried in his heart the courage of his song.
8387,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"[Footnote: Joyce Kilmer, _The Proud Poet_.]"
8388,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8389,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"It was only yesterday, indeed, that Rupert Brooke, Francis Ledwidge,"
8390,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Alan Seeger and Joyce Kilmer made the memory of the soldier poet
8391,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,lasting. And it cannot be justly charged that the draft carried the
8392,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"poet, along with the street-loafer, into the fray, an unwilling victim."
8393,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"From Aeschylus and David to Byron and the recent war poets, the singer"
8394,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,may find plenty of names to substantiate his claim that he glories in
8395,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,war as his natural element. [Footnote: For poetry dealing with the poet
8396,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"as a warrior see Thomas Moore, _The Minstrel Boy, O Blame Not the Bard,"

8411,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Artists_; Norreys Jephson O'Connor, _In Memoriam: Francis Ledwidge_;"
8412,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Donald F. Goold Johnson, _Rupert Brooke_.] A recent writer has said,"
8413,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"""The poet must ever go where the greatest songs are singing,"" [Footnote:"
8414,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"See Christopher Morley, Essay on Joyce Kilmer.] and nowhere is the"
8415,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,poetry of life so manifest as where life is in constant hazard. The
8416,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,verse of Rupert Brooke and Alan Seeger surely makes it plain that
8417,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"warfare was the spark which touched off their genius, even as it might"
8418,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"have done Byron's,"
8419,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8420,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"When the true lightning of his soul was bared,"
8421,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Long smouldering till the Mesolonghi torch.
8422,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"[Footnote: Stephen Phillips, _Emily Brontë_.]"
8423,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8424,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"But no matter how heroic the poet may prove himself to be, in his"
8425,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"character of soldier, or how efficient as a man of affairs, this does"
8426,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"not settle his quarrel with the utilitarians, for they are not to be"
8427,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,pacified by a recital of the poet's avocations. They would remind him
8428,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"that the world claims the whole of his time. If, after a day of"
8429,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"strenuous activity, he hurries home with the pleasant conviction that he"
8430,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"has earned a long evening in which to woo the Muse, the world is too"
8431,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"likely to peer through the shutters and exclaim, ""What? Not in bed yet?"
8432,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Then come out and do some extra chores."" If the poet is to prove his"
8433,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"title as an efficient citizen, it is clear that he must reveal some"
8434,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,merit in verse-making itself. If he can make no more ambitious claims
8435,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"for himself, he must, at the very least, show that Browning was not at"
8436,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,fault when he excused his occupation:
8437,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8438,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"I said, to do little is bad; to do nothing is worse,"
8439,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,And wrote verse.
8440,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: Ferishtah's Fancies.]
8441,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8442,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,How can the poet satisfy the philistine world that his songs are worth
8443,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"while? Need we ask? Business men will vouch for their utility, if he"
8444,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,will but conform to business men's ideas of art. Here is a typical
8445,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"expression of their views, couched in verse for the singer's better"
8446,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,comprehension:
8447,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8448,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"The days of long-haired poets now are o'er,"
8449,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,The short-haired poet seems to have the floor;
8450,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,For now the world no more attends to rhymes
8451,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,That do not catch the spirit of the times.
8452,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"The short-haired poet has no muse or chief,"
8453,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,He sings of corn. He eulogizes beef.
8454,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"[Footnote: ""The Short-haired Poet,"" in _Common-Sense_, by E. F. Ware.]"
8455,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8456,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"But the poet utterly repudiates such a view of himself as this, for he"
8457,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,cannot draw his breath in the commercial world. [Footnote: Several poems
8458,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,lately have voiced the poet's horror of materialism. See Josephine
8459,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Preston Peabody, _The Singing Man_; Richard Le Gallienne, _To R. W."
8460,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Emerson, Richard Watson Gilder_; Mary Robinson, _Art and Life_.] In vain"
8461,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,he assures his would-be friends that the intangibilities with which he
8462,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"deals have a value of their own. Emerson says,"
8463,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8464,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,One harvest from thy field
8465,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Homeward brought the oxen strong;
8466,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,A second crop thine acres yield
8467,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Which I gather in a song.
8468,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _Apology_]
8469,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8470,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,But for this second crop the practical man says he can find absolutely
8471,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,no market; hence overtures of friendliness between him and the poet end
8472,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,with sneers and contempt on both sides. Doubtless the best way for the
8473,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"poet to deal with the perennial complaints of the practical-minded, is"
8474,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"simply to state brazenly, as did Oscar Wilde, ""All art is quite"
8475,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"useless."" [Footnote: Preface to _Dorian Gray_.]"
8476,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8477,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Is the poet justified, then, in stopping his ears to all censure, and"
8478,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,living unto himself? Not so; when the hub-bub of his sordid accusers
8479,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"dies away, he is conscious of another summons, before a tribunal which"
8480,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,he cannot despise or ignore. For once more the poet's equivocal position
8481,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,exposes him to attacks from all quarters. He stands midway between the
8482,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"spiritual and the physical worlds, he reveals the ideal in the sensual."
8483,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Therefore, while the practical man complains that the poet does not"
8484,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"handle the solid objects of the physical world, but transmutes them to"
8485,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"airy nothings, the philosopher, on the contrary, condemns the poet"
8486,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,because he does not wholly sever connections with this same physical
8487,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"world, but is continually hovering about it, like a homesick ghost."
8488,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8489,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Like the plain man, the philosopher gives the poet a chance to vindicate"
8490,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,his usefulness. Plato's challenge is not so age-worn that we may not
8491,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"requote it. He makes Socrates say, in the _Republic_,"
8492,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8493,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Let us assure our sweet friend (poetry) and the sister arts of imitation
8494,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"that if she will only prove her title to exist in a well-ordered state,"
8495,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,we shall be delighted to receive her.... We are very conscious of her
8496,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"charms, but we may not on that account betray the truth.... Shall I"
8497,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"propose, then, that she be allowed to return from exile, but on this"
8498,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"condition only, that she makes a defense of herself in lyrical or some"
8499,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,other meter? And we may further grant to those of her defenders who are
8500,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,lovers of poetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on
8501,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,her behalf. Let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful
8502,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"to states and to human life, and we will listen in a kindly spirit."
8503,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"[Footnote: _Republic_, Book X, 607.]"

8506,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8507,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,One wonders why the lovers of Poetry have been so much more solicitous
8508,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"for her cause than Poetry herself has appeared to be. Aristotle, and"
8509,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"after him many others,--in the field of English literature, Sidney,"
8510,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Shelley, and in our own day G. E. Woodberry,--have made most eloquent"
8511,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"defenses in prose, but thus far the supreme lyrical defense has not been"
8512,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,forthcoming. Perhaps Poetry feels that it is beneath her dignity to
8513,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,attempt a utilitarian justification for herself. Yet in the verse of the
8514,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,last century and a half there are occasional passages which give the
8515,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"impression that Poetry, with childishly averted head, is offering them"
8516,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"to us, as if to say, ""Don't think I would stoop to defend myself, but"
8517,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"here are some things I might say for myself, if I wished."""
8518,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8519,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Since the Platonic philosopher and the practical man stand for antipodal
8520,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"conceptions of reality, it really seems too bad that Plato will not give"
8521,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"the poet credit for a little merit, in comparison with his arch-enemy."
8522,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"But as a matter of fact, the spectator of eternity and the sense-blinded"
8523,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"man of the street form a grotesque fraternity, for the nonce, and the"
8524,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,philosopher assures the plain man that he is far more to his liking than
8525,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"is the poet. Plato's reasoning is, of course, that the plain man at"
8526,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"least does not tamper with the objects of sense, through which the"
8527,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"philosopher may discern gleams of the spiritual world, whereas the poet"
8528,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,distorts them till their real significance is obscured. The poet
8529,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"pretends that he is giving their real meaning, even as the philosopher,"
8530,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"but his interpretation is false. He is like a man who, by an ingenious"
8531,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"system of cross-lights and reflections, creates a wraithlike image of"
8532,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"himself in the mirror, and alleges that it is his soul, though it is"
8533,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,really only a misleading and worthless imitation of his body.
8534,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8535,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Will not Plato's accusation of the poet's inferiority to the practical
8536,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,man be made clearest if we stay by Plato's own humble illustration of
8537,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"the three beds? One, he says, is made by God, one by the carpenter, and"
8538,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"one by the poet. [Footnote: See the _Republic_ X, 596 B ff.] Now"
8539,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"the bed which a certain poet, James Thomson, B. V., made, is fairly well"
8540,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"known. It speaks, in ""ponderous bass,"" to the other furniture in the"
8541,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,room:
8542,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8543,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"""I know what is and what has been;"
8544,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Not anything to me comes strange,"
8545,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Who in so many years have seen
8546,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,And lived through every kind of change.
8547,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"I know when men are bad or good,"
8548,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"When well or ill,"" he slowly said,"
8549,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"""When sad or glad, when sane or mad"
8550,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"And when they sleep alive or dead."""
8551,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _In the Room_]
8552,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8553,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Plato would say of this majestic four-poster, with its multifarious"
8554,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"memories ""of births and deaths and marriage nights,"" that it does not"
8555,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,come so near the essential idea of bedness as does the most non-descript
8556,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"product of the carpenters' tools. James Thomson's poem, he would say, is"
8557,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,on precisely the same plane as the reflection of one's bed in the mirror
8558,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"across the room. Therefore he inquires, ""Now do you suppose that if a"
8559,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"person were able to make the original as well as the image, he would"
8560,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,seriously devote himself to the image-making branch? Would he allow
8561,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"imitation to be the ruling principle of his life, as if he had nothing"
8562,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"higher in him? ... Imitation is only a kind of play or sport."""
8563,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"[Footnote: _Republic_ X, 599 A.]"
8564,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8565,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,It has long been the fashion for those who care for poetry to shake
8566,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,their heads over Plato's aberration at this point. It seems absurd
8567,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,enough to us to hear the utility of a thing determined by its number of
8568,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,dimensions. What virtue is there in merely filling space? We all feel
8569,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,the fallacy in such an adaptation of Plato's argument as Longfellow
8570,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"assigns to Michael Angelo, causing that versatile artist to conclude:"
8571,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8572,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Painting and sculpture are but images;
8573,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Are merely shadows cast by outward things
8574,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"On stone or canvas, having in themselves"
8575,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"No separate existence. Architecture,"
8576,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"As something in itself, and not an image,"
8577,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"A something that is not, surpasses them"
8578,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,As substance shadow.
8579,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _Michael Angelo_.]
8580,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8581,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Yet it may be that the homeliness of Plato's illustration has misled us
8582,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,as to the seriousness of the problem. Let us forget about beds and
8583,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,buildings and think of actual life in the more dignified way that has
8584,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,become habitual to us since the war. Then it must appear that Plato's
8585,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,charge is as truly a live issue here and now as it ever was in Athens.
8586,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"The claims for the supremacy of poetry, set forth by Aristotle, Sidney"
8587,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"and the rest, seem to weaken, for the time being, at least, when we find"
8588,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"that in our day the judgment that poetry is inferior to life comes, not"
8589,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"from outsiders, but from men who were at one time most ardent votaries"
8590,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,of the muse. Repudiation by verse-writers of poetry's highest claims we
8591,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"have been accustomed to dismiss, until recently, as betrayal of a streak"
8592,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"of commonness in the speaker's nature,--of a disposition to value the"
8593,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"clay of life more highly than the fire. We were not, perhaps, inclined"
8594,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"to take even so great a poet as Byron very seriously when he declared,"
8595,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"""I by no means rank poets or poetry high in the scale of the intellect."
8596,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"It is the lava of the imagination, whose eruption prevents an"
8597,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"earthquake. I prefer the talents of action."" But with the outbreak of"
8598,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,the world war one met unquestionably sincere confession from more than
8599,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"one poet that he found verse-writing a pale and anemic thing. Thus ""A."
8600,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"E."" regretted the time that he spent on poetry, sighing,"
8601,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8602,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,He who might have wrought in flame
8603,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Only traced upon the foam.
8604,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _Epilogue_]
8605,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8606,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"In the same spirit are Joyce Kilmer's words, written shortly before his"
8607,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"death in the trenches: ""I see daily and nightly the expression of beauty"
8608,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"in action instead of words, and I find it more satisfactory."" [Footnote:"
8609,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Letter, May 7, 1918. See Joyce Kilmer's works, edited by Richard Le"
8610,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Gallienne.] Also we have the decision of Francis Ledwidge, another poet"
8611,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,who died a soldier:
8612,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8613,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"A keen-edged sword, a soldier's heart,"
8614,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Are greater than a poet's art,"
8615,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,And greater than a poet's fame
8616,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,A little grave that has no name.
8617,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _Soliloquy_.]
8618,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8619,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Is not our idealization of poets who died in war a confession that we
8620,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"ourselves believe that they chose the better part,--that they did well"
8621,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,to discard imitation of life for life itself?
8622,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8623,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,It is not fair to force an answer to such a question till we have more
8624,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,thoroughly canvassed poets' convictions on this matter. Do they all
8625,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"admit the justice of Plato's characterization of poetry as a sport,"
8626,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"comparable to golf or tennis? In a few specific instances, poets have"
8627,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"taken this attitude toward their own verse, of course. There was the"
8628,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"""art for art's sake"" cry, which at the end of the last century surely"
8629,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,degenerated into such a conception of poetry. There have been a number
8630,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"of poets like Austin Dobson and Andrew Lang, who have frankly regarded"
8631,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,their verse as a pastime to while away an idle hour. There was
8632,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Swinburne, who characterized many of his poems as being idle and light"
8633,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,as white butterflies. [Footnote: See the _Dedication to Christina
8634,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Rossetti_, and _Envoi_.] But when we turn away from these"
8635,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"prestidigitators of rhymes and rhythms, we find that no view of poetry"
8636,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,is less acceptable than this one to poets in general. They are far more
8637,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,likely to earn the world's ridicule by the deadly seriousness with which
8638,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"they take verse writing. If the object of his pursuit is a sport, the"
8639,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,average poet is as little aware of it as is the athlete who suffers a
8640,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,nervous collapse before the big game of the season.
8641,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8642,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,But Plato's more significant statement is untouched. Is poetry an
8643,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"imitation of life? It depends, of course, upon how broadly we interpret"
8644,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"the phrase, ""imitation of life."" In one sense almost every poet would"
8645,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,say that Plato was right in characterizing poetry thus. The usual
8646,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,account of inspiration points to passive mirroring of life. Someone has
8647,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"said of the poet,"
8648,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8649,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,As a lake
8650,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Reflects the flower, tree, rock, and bending heaven,"
8651,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Shall he reflect our great humanity.
8652,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"[Footnote: Alexander Smith, _A Life Drama_.]"
8653,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8654,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,And these lines are not false to the general view of the poet's
8655,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"function, but they leave us leeway to quarrel over the nature of the"
8656,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"reflection mentioned, just as we quarrel over the exact connotations of"
8657,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Plato's and Aristotle's word, imitation. Even if we hold to the narrower"
8658,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"meaning of imitation, there are a few poets who intimate that imitation"
8659,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,alone is their aim in writing poetry. Denying that life has an ideal
8660,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"element, they take pains to mirror it, line for line, and blemish for"
8661,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,blemish. How can they meet Plato's question as to their usefulness? If
8662,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"life is a hideous, meaningless thing, as they insinuate, it is not clear"
8663,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,what merit can abide in a faithful reflection of it. Let us take the
8664,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"case of Robert Service, who prided himself upon the realism of his war"
8665,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,poetry. [Footnote: See _Rhymes of a Red Cross Man_.] Perhaps his
8666,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"defense depends, more truly than he realized, upon the implication"
8667,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"contained in his two lines,"
8668,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8669,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"If there's good in war and crime,"
8670,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,There may be in my bits of rhyme.
8671,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: See _Ibid_.]
8672,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8673,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Yet the realist may find a sort of justification for himself; at least
8674,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"James Thomson, B.V., thinks he has found one for him. The most"
8675,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"thoroughly hopeless exposition of the world's meaninglessness, in"
8676,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"English poetry, is doubtless Thomson's _City of Dreadful Night_."
8677,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Why does the author give such a ghastly thing to the world? In order, he"
8678,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"says, that some other clear-eyed spectator of the nightmare of existence"
8679,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"may gain a forlorn comfort from it, since he will know that a comrade"
8680,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,before him has likewise seen things at their blackest and worst. But
8681,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,would Plato accept this as a justification for realistic poetry? It is
8682,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,doubtful. No one could be comforted by a merely literal rendering of
8683,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"life. The comfort must derive from the personal equation, which is the"
8684,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,despair engendered in the author by dreams of something better than
8685,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,reality; therefore whatever merit resides in such poetry comes not from
8686,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"its realism, but from the idealism of the writer."
8687,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8688,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,We must not think that all poets who regard their poetry as a reflection
8689,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"of this world alone, agree in praising glaring realism as a virtue."
8690,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Rather, some of them say, the value of their reflection lies in its"
8691,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"misty indistinctness. Life may be sordid and ugly at first hand, but let"
8692,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"the artist's reflection only be remote enough, and the jagged edges and"
8693,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,dissonances of color which mar daily living will be lost in the purple
8694,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"haze of distance. Gazing at such a reflection, men may perhaps forget,"
8695,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"for a space, how dreary a thing existence really is."
8696,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8697,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,And they shall be accounted poet-kings
8698,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Who simply tell the most heart-easing things,"
8699,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _Sleep and Poetry_.]
8700,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8701,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,said Keats in his youth. Such a statement of the artist's purpose
8702,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,inevitably calls up William Morris:
8703,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8704,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Dreamer of dreams, born out of my due time,"
8705,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Why should I strive to set the crooked straight?
8706,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Let it suffice me that my murmuring rhyme
8707,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Beats with light wing against the ivory gate,"
8708,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Telling a tale, not too importunate"
8709,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"To those who in the sleepy region stay,"
8710,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Lulled by the singer of an empty day.
8711,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _Prologue to the Earthly Paradise_.]
8712,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8713,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Would Plato scoff at such a formulation of the artist's mission? He
8714,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"would rather condemn it, as fostering illusion and falsehood in men's"
8715,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"minds. But we moderns are perhaps more world-weary, less sanguine about"
8716,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"ideal truth than the ancients. With one of our war poets, we often plead"
8717,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"for ""song that turneth toil to rest,"" [Footnote: Madison Cawein,"
8718,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"_Preludes_.] and agree with Keats that, whether art has any other"
8719,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"justification or not, it has one ""great end, to soothe the cares of"
8720,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"man."" [Footnote: _Sleep and Poetry_.]"
8721,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8722,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,We are not to imagine that many of our poets are content with the idea
8723,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,that poetry has so minor a function as this. They play with the thought
8724,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"of life's possible insignificance and leave it, for idealism is the"
8725,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"breath of life to poets, and their adherence to realism amounts to"
8726,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"suicide. Poetry may be comforting without being illusive. Emerson says,"
8727,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8728,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,'Tis the privilege of art
8729,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Thus to play its cheerful part
8730,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Man on earth to acclimate
8731,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,And bend the exile to his fate.
8732,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _Art_.]
8733,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8734,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"It is not, obviously, Emerson's conception that the poetry which brings"
8735,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"this about falsifies. Like most poets, he indicates that art"
8736,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"accomplishes its end, not merely by obscuring the hideous accidents of"
8737,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"life, but by enabling us to glimpse an ideal element which abides in it,"
8738,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,and is its essence.
8739,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8740,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Is the essence of things really a spiritual meaning? If so, it seems"
8741,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,strange that Plato should have so belittled the poet's capacity to
8742,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,render the spiritual meaning in verse. But it is possible that the
8743,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,artist's view as to the relation of the ideal to the physical does not
8744,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,precisely square with Plato's. Though poets are so constitutionally
8745,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Platonic, in this one respect they are perhaps more truly Aristotelians."
8746,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Plato seems to say that ideality is not, as a matter of fact, the"
8747,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"essence of objects. It is a light reflected upon them, as the sun's"
8748,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,light is reflected upon the moon. So he claims that the artist who
8749,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"portrays life is like one who, drawing a picture of the moon, gives"
8750,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"usonly a map of her craters, and misses entirely the only thing that"
8751,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"gives the moon any meaning, that is, moonlight. But the poet, that lover"
8752,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"of the sensuous, cannot quite accept such a view as this. Ideality is"
8753,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"truly the essence of objects, he avers, though it is overlaid with a"
8754,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,mass of meaningless material. Hence the poet who gives us a
8755,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"representation of things is not obscuring them, but is doing us a"
8756,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"service by simplifying them, and so making their ideality clearer. All"
8757,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,that the most idealistic poet need do is to imitate; as Mrs. Browning
8758,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"says,"
8759,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8760,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Paint a body well,"
8761,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,You paint a soul by implication.
8762,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _Aurora Leigh_.]
8763,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8764,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,This firm faith that the sensual is the dwelling-place of the spiritual
8765,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,accounts for the poet's impatience with the contention that his art is
8766,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"useless unless he points a lesson, by manipulating his materials toward"
8767,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,a conscious moral end. The poet refuses to turn objects this way and
8768,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"that, until they catch a reflection from a separate moral world. If he"
8769,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"tries to write with two distinct purposes, hoping to ""suffice the eye"
8770,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"and save the soul beside,"" [Footnote: _The Ring and the Book_.] as"
8771,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Browning puts it, he is apt to hide the intrinsic spirituality of things"
8772,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,under a cloak of ready-made moral conceptions. In his moments of deepest
8773,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"insight the poet is sure that his one duty is to reveal beauty clearly,"
8774,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"without troubling himself about moralizing, and he assures his readers,"
8775,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8776,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"If you get simple beauty and naught else,"
8777,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,You get about the best thing God invents.
8778,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"[Footnote: _Fra, Lippo Lippi_.]"
8779,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8780,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Probably poets have always felt, in their hearts, what the radicals of"
8781,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"the present day are saying so vehemently, that the poet should not be"
8782,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"expected to sermonize: ""I wish to state my firm belief,"" says Amy"
8783,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Lowell, ""that poetry should not try to teach, that it should exist"
8784,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"simply because it is created beauty."" [Footnote: Preface to _Sword"
8785,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Blades and Poppy Seed_. See also Joyce Kilmer, Letter to Howard W."
8786,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Cook, June 28, 1918.]"
8787,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8788,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Even conceding that the ideal lives within the sensual, it may seem that"
8789,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,the poet is too sanguine in his claim that he is able to catch the ideal
8790,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,and significant feature of a thing rather than its accidents. Why should
8791,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"this be? Apparently because his thirst is for balance, proportion,"
8792,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,harmony--what you will--leading him to see life as a unity.
8793,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8794,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"The artist's eyes are able to see life in focus, as it were, though it"
8795,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,has appeared to men of less harmonious spirit as
8796,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8797,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"A many-sided mirror,"
8798,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Which could distort to many a shape of error
8799,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"This true, fair world of things."
8800,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"[Footnote: Shelley, _Prometheus Unbound_.]"
8801,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8802,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"It is as if the world were a jumbled picture puzzle, which only the"
8803,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"artist is capable of putting together, and the fact that the essence of"
8804,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"things, as he conceives of them, thus forms a harmonious whole is to him"
8805,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,irrefutable proof that the intuition that leads him to see things in
8806,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,this way is not leading him astray. James Russell Lowell has described
8807,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,the poet's achievement:
8808,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8809,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"With a sorrowful and conquering beauty,"
8810,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,The soul of all looked grandly from his eyes.
8811,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _Ode_.]
8812,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8813,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"""The soul of all,"" that is the artist's revelation. To him the world is"
8814,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"truly a universe, not a heterogeneity of unrelated things. In different"
8815,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"mode from Lowell, Mrs. Browning expresses the same conception of the"
8816,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"artist's imitation of life, inquiring,"
8817,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8818,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,What is art
8819,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"But life upon the larger scale, the higher,"
8820,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"When, graduating up a spiral line"
8821,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Of still expanding and ascending gyres
8822,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,It pushes toward the intense significance
8823,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Of all things, hungry for the infinite."
8824,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _Aurora Leigh_.]
8825,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8826,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"The poet cannot accept Plato's characterization of him as an imitator,"
8827,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"then, not if this implies that his imitations are inferior to their"
8828,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"objects. Rather, the poet proudly maintains, they are infinitely"
8829,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"superior, being in fact closer approximations to the meaning of things"
8830,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,than are the things themselves. Thus Shelley describes the poet's work:
8831,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8832,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,He will watch from dawn to gloom
8833,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,The lake-reflected sun illume
8834,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"The yellow bees in the ivy bloom,"
8835,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Nor heed nor see, what things they be;"
8836,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,But from these create he can
8837,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Forms more real than living man,"
8838,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Nurslings of immortality.
8839,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _Prometheus Unbound_.]
8840,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8841,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Therefore the poet has usually claimed for himself the title, not of"
8842,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"imitator, but of seer. To his purblind readers, who see men as trees"
8843,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"walking, he is able, with the search-light of his genius, to reveal the"
8844,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"essential forms of things. Mrs. Browning calls him ""the speaker of"
8845,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"essential truth, opposed to relative, comparative and temporal truth"";"
8846,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"[Footnote: _Aurora Leigh_.] James Russell Lowell calls him ""the"
8847,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"discoverer and revealer of the perennial under the deciduous"";"
8848,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"[Footnote: _The Function of the Poet_.] Emerson calls him ""the only"
8849,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"teller of news."" [Footnote: _Poetry and Imagination_. The following are"
8850,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,some of the poems asserting that the poet is the speaker of ideal truth:

8867,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8868,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Here we are, then, at the real point of dispute between the philosopher"
8869,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,and the poet. They claim the same vantage-point from which to overlook
8870,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,human life. One would think they might peacefully share the same
8871,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"pinnacle, but as a matter of fact they are continuously jostling one"
8872,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,another. In vain one tries to quiet their contentiousness. Turning to
8873,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"the most deeply Platonic poets of our period--Coleridge, Wordsworth,"
8874,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Shelley, Arnold, Emerson,--one may inquire, Does not your description of"
8875,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,the poet precisely tally with Plato's description of the philosopher?
8876,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Yes, they aver, but Plato falsified when he named his seer a philosopher"
8877,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"rather than a poet. [Footnote: In rare cases, the poet identifies"
8878,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"himself with the philosopher. See Coleridge, _The Garden of Boccaccio_;"
8879,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Kirke White, _Lines Written on Reading Some of His Own Earlier Sonnets_;"
8880,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Bulwer Lytton, _Milton_; George E. Woodberry, _Agathon_.] Surely if the"
8881,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"quarrel may be thus reduced to a matter of terminology, it grows"
8882,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"trivial, but let us see how the case stands."
8883,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8884,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,From one approach the dispute seems to arise from a comparison of
8885,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,methods. Coleridge praises the truth of Wordsworth's poetry as being
8886,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8887,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Not learnt, but native, her own natural notes."
8888,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _To William Wordsworth_.]
8889,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8890,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Wordsworth himself boasts over the laborious investigator of facts,"
8891,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8892,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Think you, mid all this mighty sum"
8893,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Of things forever speaking,"
8894,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"That nothing of itself will come,"
8895,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,We must be ever seeking?
8896,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _Expostulation and Reply_.]
8897,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8898,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,But the dispute goes deeper than mere method. The poet's immediate
8899,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"intuition is superior to the philosopher's toilsome research, he"
8900,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"asserts, because it captures ideality alive, whereas the philosopher can"
8901,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"only kill and dissect it. As Wordsworth phrases it, poetry is ""the"
8902,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,breath and finer spirit of all knowledge; the impassioned expression
8903,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"which is in the countenance of all science."" Philosophy is useful to the"
8904,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"poet only as it presents facts for his synthesis; Shelley states,"
8905,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"""Reason is to the imagination as the instrument to the agent, as the"
8906,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"body to the spirit, as the shadow to the substance."" [Footnote: _A"
8907,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Defense of Poetry_.]
8908,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8909,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"To this the philosopher may rejoin that poetry, far from making"
8910,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"discoveries beyond the bourne of philosophy, is a mere popularization, a"
8911,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"sugar-coating, of the philosopher's discoveries. Tolstoi contends,"
8912,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8913,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,True science investigates and brings to human perception such
8914,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,truths and such knowledge as the people of a given time and
8915,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,society consider most important. Art transmits these truths
8916,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,from the region of perception to the region of emotion. And
8917,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,thus a false activity of science inevitably causes a
8918,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,correspondingly false activity of art. [Footnote: _What is
8919,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Art?_]
8920,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8921,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Such criticisms have sometimes incensed the poet till he has refused to
8922,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"acknowledge any indebtedness to the dissecting hand of science, and has"
8923,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,pronounced the philosopher's attitude of mind wholly antagonistic to
8924,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,poetry.
8925,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8926,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Philosophy will clip an angel's wings,"
8927,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Conquer all mysteries by rule and line,"
8928,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _Lamia_.]
8929,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8930,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Keats once complained. ""Sleep in your intellectual crust!"" [Footnote:"
8931,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,_A Poet's Epitaph_.]
8932,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8933,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Wordsworth contemptuously advised the philosopher, and not a few other"
8934,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,poets have felt that philosophy deadens life as a crust of ice deadens a
8935,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,flowing stream. That reason kills poetry is the unoriginal theme of a
8936,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"recent poem. The poet scornfully characterizes present writers,"
8937,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8938,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"We are they who dream no dreams,"
8939,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Singers of a rising day,"
8940,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Who undaunted,"
8941,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Where the sword of reason gleams,"
8942,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Follow hard, to hew away"
8943,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,The woods enchanted.
8944,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"[Footnote: E. Flecker, _Donde Estan_.]"
8945,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8946,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,One must turn to Poe for the clearest statement of the antagonism. He
8947,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"declares,"
8948,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8949,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Science, true daughter of Old Time thou art!"
8950,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes,"
8951,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Why preyest thou thus upon the poet's heart,"
8952,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Vulture, whose wings are dull realities?"
8953,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"How should he love thee? Or how deem thee wise,"
8954,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering
8955,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,"
8956,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing?
8957,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car,"
8958,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,And driven the Hamadryad from the wood
8959,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,To seek for shelter in some happier star?
8960,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood,"
8961,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"The Elfin from the green grass, and from me"
8962,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,The summer dream beneath the tamarund tree?
8963,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _To Science_.]
8964,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8965,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"If this sort of complaint is characteristic of poets, how shall the"
8966,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,philosopher refrain from charging them with falsehood? The poet's
8967,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"hamadryad and naiad, what are they, indeed, but cobwebby fictions, which"
8968,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,must be brushed away if ideal truth is to be revealed? Critics of the
8969,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"poet like to point out that Shakespeare frankly confessed,"
8970,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8971,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Most true it is that I have looked on truth
8972,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Askance and strangely,"
8973,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8974,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"and that a renegade artist of the nineteenth century admitted, ""Lying,"
8975,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"the telling of beautiful untrue things, is the proper aim of Art."""
8976,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"[Footnote: Oscar Wilde, _The Decay of Lying_.] If poets complain that"
8977,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,all charms fly
8978,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"At the mere touch of cold philosophy,"
8979,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _Lamia_.]
8980,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8981,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,are they not admitting that their vaunted revelations are mere ghosts of
8982,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"distorted facts, and that they themselves are merely accomplished liars?"
8983,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8984,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,In his rebuttal the poet makes a good case for himself. He has
8985,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"identified the philosopher with the scientist, he says, and rightly, for"
8986,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"the philosopher, the seeker for truth alone, can never get beyond the"
8987,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"realm of science. His quest of absolute truth will lead him, first, to"
8988,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"the delusive rigidity of scientific classification, then, as he tries to"
8989,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"make his classification complete, it will topple over like a lofty tower"
8990,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"of child's blocks, into the original chaos of things."
8991,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
8992,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"What! the philosopher may retort, the poet speaks thus of truth, who has"
8993,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"just exalted himself as the supreme truth-teller, the seer? But the poet"
8994,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,answers that his truth is not in any sense identical with that of the
8995,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,scientist and the philosopher. Not everything that exists is true for
8996,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"the poet, but only that which has beauty. Therefore he has no need"
8997,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,laboriously to work out a scientific method for sifting facts. If his
8998,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"love of the beautiful is satisfied by a thing, that thing is real."
8999,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"""Beauty is truth, truth beauty""; Keats' words have been echoed and"
9000,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,reechoed by poets. [Footnote: A few examples of poems dealing with this
9001,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"subject are Shelley, _A Hymn to Intellectual Beauty_; Mrs. Browning,"
9002,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"_Pan Is Dead_; Henry Timrod, _A Vision of Poesy_; Madison Cawein,"
9003,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,_Prototypes_.] If Poe's rejection of
9004,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9005,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"The loftiest star of unascended heaven,"
9006,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Pinnacled dim in the intense inane,"
9007,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9008,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"in favor of attainable ""treasures of the jewelled skies"" be an offense"
9009,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"against truth, it is not, poets would say, because of his"
9010,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"non-conformance to the so-called facts of astronomy, but because his"
9011,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"sense of beauty is at fault, leading him to prefer prettiness to"
9012,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"sublimity. As for the poet's visions, of naiad and dryad, which the"
9013,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"philosopher avers are less true than chemical and physical forces, they"
9014,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"represent the hidden truth of beauty, which is threaded through the ugly"
9015,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"medley of life, being invisible till under the light of the poet's"
9016,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"thought it flashes out like a pattern in golden thread, woven through a"
9017,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,somber tapestry.
9018,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9019,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,It is only when the poet is not keenly alive to beauty that he begins to
9020,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"fret about making an artificial connection between truth and beauty, or,"
9021,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"as he is apt to rename them, between wisdom and fancy. In the eighteenth"
9022,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"century when the poet's vision of truth became one with the scientist's,"
9023,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"he could not conceive of beauty otherwise than as gaudy ornaments,"
9024,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"""fancies,"" with which he might trim up his thoughts. The befuddled"
9025,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,conception lasted over into the romantic period; Beattie [Footnote: See
9026,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,_The Minstrel_.] and Bowles [Footnote: See _The Visionary Boy_.] both
9027,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,warned their poets to include both fancy and wisdom in their poetry.
9028,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Even Landor reflected,"
9029,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9030,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"A marsh, where only flat leaves lie,"
9031,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,And showing but the broken sky
9032,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Too surely is the sweetest lay
9033,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,That wins the ear and wastes the day
9034,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Where youthful Fancy pouts alone
9035,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,And lets not wisdom touch her zone.
9036,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: See _To Wordsworth_.]
9037,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9038,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,But the poet whose sense of beauty is unerring gives no heed to such
9039,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,distinctions.
9040,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9041,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,If the scientist scoffs at the poet's intuitive selection of ideal
9042,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"values, declaring that he might just as well take any other aspect of"
9043,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"things--their number, solidarity, edibleness--instead of beauty, for his"
9044,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"test of their reality, the poet has his answer ready. After all, this"
9045,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"poet, this dreamer, is a pragmatist at heart. To the scientist's charge"
9046,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"that his test is absurd, his answer is simply, It works."
9047,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9048,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"The world is coming to acknowledge, little by little, the poet points"
9049,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"out, that whatever he presents to it as beauty is likewise truth. ""The"
9050,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"poet's wish is nature's law,"" [Footnote: _Poem Outlines_.] says Sidney"
9051,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Lanier, and other poets, no less, assert that the poet is in unison with"
9052,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"nature. Wordsworth calls poetry ""a force, like one of nature's."""
9053,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _The Prelude_.] One of Oscar Wilde's cleverest paradoxes is
9054,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"to the effect that nature imitates art, [Footnote: See the Essay on"
9055,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Criticism.] and in so far as nature is one with human perception, there"
9056,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"is no doubt that it is true. ""What the imagination seizes as beauty must"
9057,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"be truth,"" Keats wrote, ""whether it existed before or not."" [Footnote:"
9058,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Letter to B. Baillie, November 17, 1817.] And again, ""The imagination"
9059,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"may be compared to Adam's dream--he awoke and found it truth."""
9060,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"[Footnote: Letter to B. Baillie, November 17, 1817.]"
9061,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9062,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"If the poet's intuitions are false, how does it chance, he inquires,"
9063,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"that he has been known, in all periods of the world's history, as a"
9064,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"prophet? Shelley says, ""Poets are ... the mirrors of the gigantic"
9065,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"shadows which futurity casts upon the present,"" and explains the"
9066,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"phenomenon thus: ""A poet participates in the eternal, the infinite, the"
9067,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"one; so far as related to his conceptions, time and place and number are"
9068,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"not."" [Footnote: _A Defense of Poetry_.] In our period, verse dealing"
9069,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,with the Scotch bard is fondest of stressing the immemorial association
9070,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"of the poet and the prophet, and in much of this, the ""pretense of"
9071,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"superstition"" as Shelley calls it, is kept up, that the poet can"
9072,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"foretell specific happenings. [Footnote: See, for example, Gray, _The"
9073,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Bard_; Scott, _The Lady of the Lake_, _The Lay of the Last Minstrel_,"
9074,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"_Thomas the Rhymer_; Campbell, _Lochiel's Warning_.] But we have many"
9075,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,poems that express a broader conception of the poet's gift of prophecy.

9084,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9085,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,We call those poets who are first to mark
9086,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Through earth's dull mist the coming of the dawn,--"
9087,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Who see in twilight's gloom the first pale spark

9089,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,For them the Lord of light the curtain rent

9091,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _Shakespeare_.]
9092,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9093,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Most of these poems account for the premonitions of the poet as Shelley
9094,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,does; as a more recent poet has phrased it:
9095,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9096,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Strange hints
9097,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Of things past, present and to come there lie"
9098,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Sealed in the magic pages of that music,"
9099,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Which, laying hold on universal laws,"
9100,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Ranges beyond these mud-walls of the flesh.
9101,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"[Footnote: Alfred Noyes, _Tales of the Mermaid Inn_.]"
9102,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9103,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,The poet's defense is not finished when he establishes the truth of his
9104,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"vision. How shall the world be served, he is challenged, even though it"
9105,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,be true that the poet's dreams are of reality? Plato demanded of his
9106,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"philosophers that they return to the cave of sense, after they had seen"
9107,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"the heavenly vision, and free the slaves there. Is the poet willing to"
9108,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"do this? It has been charged that he is not. Browning muses,"
9109,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9110,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Ah, but to find"
9111,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"A certain mood enervate such a mind,"
9112,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Counsel it slumber in the solitude
9113,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Thus reached, nor, stooping, task for mankind's good"
9114,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Its nature just, as life and time accord."
9115,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,--Too narrow an arena to reward
9116,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Emprize--the world's occasion worthless since
9117,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Not absolutely fitted to evince
9118,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Its mastery!
9119,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _Sordello_.]
9120,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9121,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"But one is inclined to question the justice of Browning's charge, at"
9122,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"least so far as it applies peculiarly to the poet. Logically, he should"
9123,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"devote himself to sense-blinded humanity, not reluctantly, like the"
9124,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,philosopher descending to a gloomy cave which is not his natural
9125,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"habitat, but eagerly, since the poet is dependent upon sense as well as"
9126,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"spirit for his vision. ""This is the privilege of beauty,"" says Plato,"
9127,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"""that, being the loveliest of the ideas, she is also the most palpable"
9128,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"to sight."" [Footnote: _Phaedrus_.] Accordingly the poet has no"
9129,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"horror of physical vision as a bondage, but he is fired with an"
9130,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,enthusiasm to make the world of sense a more transparent medium of
9131,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,beauty. [Footnote: For poetry dealing with the poet's humanitarian

9161,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,poet may have ever deeper inspiration. This is the central allegory in
9162,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"_Enydmion_, that the poet must learn to help humanity before the mystery"
9163,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,of poetship shall be unlocked to him. Browning comments to this effect
9164,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,upon Bordello's unwillingness to meet the world:
9165,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9166,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,But all is changed the moment you descry
9167,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Mankind as half yourself.
9168,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9169,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Matthew Arnold is the sternest of modern poets, perhaps, in pointing out"
9170,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,the poet's responsibility to humanity:
9171,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9172,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"The poet, to whose mighty heart"
9173,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Heaven doth a quicker pulse impart,"
9174,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Subdues that energy to scan
9175,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Not his own course, but that of man."
9176,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Though he move mountains, though his day"
9177,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Be passed on the proud heights of sway,"
9178,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Though he hath loosed a thousand chains,"
9179,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Though he hath borne immortal pains,"
9180,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Action and suffering though he know,"
9181,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"He hath not lived, if he lives so."
9182,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _Resignation_.]
9183,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9184,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,It is obvious that in the poet's opinion there is only one means by
9185,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"which he can help humanity, and that is by helping men to express their"
9186,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"essential natures; in other words, by setting them free. Liberty is"
9187,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,peculiarly the watch-word of the poets. To the philosopher and the
9188,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"moralist, on the contrary, there is no merit in liberty alone. Men must"
9189,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"be free before they can seek wisdom or goodness, no doubt, but something"
9190,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"beside freedom is needed, they feel, to make men good or evil. But to"
9191,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"the poet, beauty and liberty are almost synonymous. If beauty is the"
9192,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"heart of the universe (and it must be, the poet argues, since it abides"
9193,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"in sense as well as spirit), there is no place for the corrupt will. If"
9194,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"men are free, they are expressing their real natures; they are"
9195,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,beautiful.
9196,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9197,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Is this our poet's view? But hear Plato: ""The tragic poets, being wise"
9198,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"men, will forgive us, and any others who live after our manner, if we do"
9199,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"not receive them into our state, because they are the eulogists of"
9200,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"tyranny."" [Footnote: _Republic._] Few enemies of poets nowadays"
9201,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"would go so far as to make a charge like this one, though Thomas"
9202,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Peacock, who locked horns with Shelley on the question of poetry,"
9203,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,asserted that poets exist only by virtue of their flattery of earth's
9204,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"potentates. [Footnote: See _The Four Ages of Poetry._] Once, it must"
9205,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"be confessed, one of the poets themselves brought their name into"
9206,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,disrepute. In the heat of his indignation over attacks made upon his
9207,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"friend Southey, Landor was moved to exclaim,"
9208,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9209,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,If thou hast ever done amiss
9210,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"It was, O Southey, but in this,"
9211,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"That, to redeem the lost estate"
9212,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Of the poor Muse, a man so great"
9213,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Abased his laurels where some Georges stood
9214,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Knee-deep in sludge and ordure, some in blood."
9215,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Was ever genius but thyself
9216,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Friend or befriended of a Guelf?
9217,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9218,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,But these are insignificant exceptions to the general characterization
9219,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,of the modern poet as liberty-lover.
9220,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9221,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Probably Plato's equanimity would not be upset, even though we presented"
9222,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,to him an overwhelming array of evidence bearing upon the modern poet's
9223,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"allegiance to democracy. Certainly, he might say, the modern poet, like"
9224,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"the ancient one, reflects the life about him. At the time of the French"
9225,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"revolution, or of the world war, when there is a popular outcry against"
9226,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"oppression, what is more likely than that the poet's voice should be the"
9227,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,loudest in the throng? But as soon as there is a reaction toward
9228,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"monarchical government, poets will again scramble for the post of"
9229,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,poet-laureate.
9230,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9231,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"The modern poet can only repeat that this is false, and that a resume of"
9232,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,history proves it. Shelley traces the rise and decadence of poetry
9233,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"during periods of freedom and slavery. He points out, ""The period in our"
9234,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,history of the grossest degradation of the drama is the reign of Charles
9235,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"II, when all the forms in which poetry had been accustomed to be"
9236,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,expressed became hymns to the triumph of kingly power over liberty and
9237,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"virtue."" Gray, in _The Progress of Poesy_, draws the same"
9238,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,conclusion as Shelley:
9239,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9240,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Her track, where'er the goddess roves,"
9241,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Glory pursue, and generous shame,"
9242,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"The unconquerable will, and freedom's holy flame."
9243,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9244,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Other poets, if they do not base their conclusions upon history, assert"
9245,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,no less positively that every true poet is a lover of freedom.

9272,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"though even here it is something of a surprise to hear Keats, whose"
9273,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"themes are usually so far removed from political life, exclaiming,"
9274,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9275,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Where's the poet? Show him, show him,"

9279,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _The Poet_.]
9280,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9281,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Wordsworth's devotion to liberty was doubted by some of his brothers,"
9282,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"but Wordsworth himself felt that, if he were not a democrat, he would be"
9283,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"false to poetry, and he answers his detractors,"
9284,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9285,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Here pause: the poet claims at least this praise,"
9286,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,That virtuous Liberty hath been the scope
9287,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Of his pure song.
9288,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9289,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,In the Victorian period the same view holds. The Brownings were ardent
9290,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,champions of democracy. Mrs. Browning averred that the poet's thirst for
9291,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,ubiquitous beauty accounts for his love of freedom:
9292,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9293,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Poets (hear the word)
9294,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Half-poets even, are still whole democrats."
9295,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Oh, not that they're disloyal to the high,"
9296,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"But loyal to the low, and cognizant"
9297,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Of the less scrutable majesties.
9298,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _Aurora Leigh_.]
9299,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9300,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Tennyson conceived of the poet as the author of democracy. [Footnote:
9301,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,_See The Poet_.] Swinburne prolonged the Victorian paean to the
9302,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"liberty-loving poet [Footnote: See _Mater Triumphilis_, _Prelude_,"
9303,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"_Epilogue_, _Litany of Nations_, and _Hertha_.] till our new group of"
9304,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"singers appeared, whose devotion to liberty is self-evident."
9305,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9306,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"It is true that to the poet liberty is an inner thing, not always"
9307,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"synonymous with suffrage. Coleridge, Southey, Wordsworth, all came to"
9308,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,distrust the machinery of so-called freedom in society. Likewise
9309,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Browning was not in favor of too radical social changes, and Mrs."
9310,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Browning went so far as to declare, ""I love liberty so much that I hate"
9311,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"socialism."" Mob rule is as distasteful to the deeply thoughtful poet as"
9312,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"is tyranny, for the liberty which he seeks to bring into the world is"
9313,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,simply the condition in which every man is expressing the beauty of his
9314,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,truest self.
9315,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9316,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"If the poet has proved that his visions are true, and that he is eager"
9317,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"to bring society into harmony with them, what further charge remains"
9318,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"against him? That he is ""an ineffectual angel, beating his bright wings"
9319,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"in the void."" He may see a vision of Utopia, and long that men shall"
9320,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"become citizens there, but the man who actually perfects human society"
9321,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"is he who patiently toils at the ""dim, vulgar, vast, unobvious work"""
9322,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"[Footnote: See _Sordello_.] of the world, here amending a law, here"
9323,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"building a settlement house, and so on. Thus the reformer charges the"
9324,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"poet. Mrs. Browning, in _Aurora Leigh_, makes much of the issue,"
9325,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"and there the socialist, Romney Leigh, sneers at the poet's"
9326,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"inefficiency, telling Aurora that the world"
9327,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9328,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Forgets
9329,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,To rhyme the cry with which she still beats back
9330,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Those savage hungry dogs that hunt her down
9331,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,To the empty grave of Christ ...
9332,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"... Who has time,"
9333,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,An hour's time--think!--to sit upon a bank
9334,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,And hear the cymbal tinkle in white hands.
9335,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"[Footnote: _Aurora Leigh_. See also the letter to Robert Browning,"
9336,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"February 17, 1845.]"
9337,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9338,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"The poet has, occasionally, plunged into the maelstrom of reform and"
9339,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,proved to such objectors that he can work as efficiently as they. Thomas
9340,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Hood, Whittier, and other poets have challenged the respect of the"
9341,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Romney Leighs of the world. Yet one hesitates to make specialization in
9342,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"reform the gauge of a poet's merit. Where, in that case, would Keats be"
9343,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"beside Hood? In our day, where would Sara Teasdale be beside Edwin"
9344,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Markham? Is there not danger that the poet, once launched on a career as"
9345,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"an agitator, will no longer have time to dream dreams? If he bases his"
9346,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"claims of worth on his ability as a ""carpet-duster,"" [Footnote: See"
9347,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"_Aurora Leigh_.] as Mrs. Browning calls the agitator, he is merely"
9348,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"unsettling society,--for what end? He himself will soon have"
9349,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,forgotten--will have become as salt that has lost its savor. Nothing is
9350,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,more disheartening than to see men straining every nerve to make other
9351,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"men righteous, who have themselves not the faintest appreciation of the"
9352,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,beauty of holiness. Let reformers beware how they assert the poet's
9353,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"uselessness, our singers say, for it is an indication that they"
9354,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,themselves are blind to the light toward which they profess to be
9355,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,leading men. The work of the reformer inevitably degenerates into the
9356,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"mere strenuosity of the campaign,"
9357,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9358,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Unless the artist keep up open roads
9359,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Betwixt the seen and unseen, bursting through"
9360,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"The best of our conventions with his best,"
9361,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"The speakable, imaginable best"
9362,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"God bids him speak, to prove what lies beyond"
9363,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Both speech and imagination.
9364,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _Aurora Leigh_.]
9365,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9366,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Thus speaks Mrs. Browning.
9367,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9368,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"The reforms that make a stir in the world, being merely external, mean"
9369,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"little or nothing apart from the impulse that started them, and the poet"
9370,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"alone is powerful to stir the impulse of reform in humanity. ""To be"
9371,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"persuaded rests usually with ourselves,"" said Longinus, ""but genius"
9372,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"brings force sovereign and irresistible to bear upon every hearer."""
9373,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"[Footnote: _On the Sublime_.] The poet, in ideal mood, is as"
9374,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"innocent of specific designs upon current morality as was Pippa, when"
9375,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"she wandered about the streets of Asolo, but the power of his songs is"
9376,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,ever as insuperable as was that of hers. It is for this reason that
9377,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Emerson advises the poet to leave hospital building and statute revision
9378,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,for men of duller sight than he:
9379,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9380,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Oft shall war end and peace return
9381,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,And cities rise where cities burn
9382,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Ere one man my hill shall climb
9383,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Who can turn the golden rhyme.
9384,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Let them manage how they may,"
9385,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Heed thou only Saadi's lay.
9386,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _Saadi_.]
9387,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9388,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Here the philosopher may demur. If the poet were truly an idealist,--if"
9389,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"he found for the world conceptions as pure as those of mathematics,"
9390,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"which can be applied equally well to any situation, then, indeed, he"
9391,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,might regard himself as the author of progress. But it is the poet's
9392,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,failing that he gives men no vision of abstract beauty. He represents
9393,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,his visions in the contemporary dress of his times. Thus he idealizes
9394,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"the past and the present, showing beauty shining through the dullness"
9395,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"and error of human history. Is he not, then, the enemy of progress,"
9396,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,since he will lead his readers to imagine that things are ideal as they
9397,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,are?
9398,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9399,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Rather, men will be filled with reverence for the idealized portrait of"
9400,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"themselves that the poet has drawn, and the intervention of the reformer"
9401,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"will be unnecessary, since they will voluntarily tear off the shackles"
9402,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"that disfigure them. The poet, said Shelley, ""redeems from decay the"
9403,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"visitations of the divinity in man."" Emerson said of Wordsworth, ""He"
9404,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"more than any other man has done justice to the divine in us."" Mrs."
9405,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Browning said (of Carlyle) ""He fills the office of a poet--by analyzing"
9406,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"humanity back into its elements, to the destruction of the conventions"
9407,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"of the hour."" [Footnote: Letter to Robert Browning, February 27, 1845.]"
9408,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"This is what Matthew Arnold meant by calling poetry ""a criticism of"
9409,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"life."" Poetry is captivating only in proportion as the ideal shines"
9410,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,through the sensual; consequently men who are charmed by the beauty
9411,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"incarnate in poetry, are moved to discard all conventions through which"
9412,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,beauty does not shine.
9413,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9414,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Therefore, the poet repeats, he is the true author of reform. Tennyson"
9415,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"says of freedom,"
9416,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9417,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,No sword
9418,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Of wrath her right arm whirled,"
9419,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"But one poor poet's scroll, and with his word"
9420,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,She shook the world.
9421,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _The Poet_.]
9422,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9423,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,This brings us back to our war poets who have so recently died. Did they
9424,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,indeed disparage the Muse whom they deserted? Did they not rather die to
9425,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,fulfill a poet's prophesy of freedom? A poet who did not carry in his
9426,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,heart the courage of his song--what could be more discreditable to
9427,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,poetry than that? The soldier-poets were like a general who rushes into
9428,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,the thick of the fight and dies beside a private. We reverence such a
9429,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"man, but we realize that it was not his death, but his plan for the"
9430,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"engagement, that saved the day."
9431,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9432,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"If such is the poet's conception of his service to mankind, what is his"
9433,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"reward? The government of society, he returns. Emerson says,"
9434,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9435,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"The gods talk in the breath of the woods,"
9436,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"They talk in the shaken pine,"
9437,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,And fill the long reach of the old seashore
9438,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,With dialogue divine.
9439,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,And the poet who overhears
9440,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Some random word they say
9441,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Is the fated man of men
9442,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Whom the nations must obey.
9443,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: Fragment on _The Poet_.]
9444,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9445,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,What is the poet's reward? Immortality. He is confident that if his
9446,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,vision is true he shall join
9447,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9448,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,The choir invisible
9449,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Of those immortal dead who live again
9450,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,In minds made better by their presence: live
9451,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"In pulses stirred to generosity,"
9452,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"In thoughts sublime that pierce the night like stars,"
9453,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,And with their mild persistence urge man's search
9454,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,To vaster issues.
9455,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"[Footnote: George Eliot, _The Choir Invisible_.]"
9456,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9457,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Does this mean simply the immortality of fame? It is a higher thing than
9458,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"that. The beauty which the poet creates is itself creative, and having"
9459,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"the principle of life in it, can never perish. Whitman cries,"
9460,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9461,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Poets to come! orators, singers, musicians to come!"
9462,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Not today is to justify me and answer what I am for,"
9463,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"But you, a new brood, native, athletic, continental,"
9464,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"greater than before known,"
9465,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,Arouse! for you must justify me!
9466,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,[Footnote: _Poets to Come_.]
9467,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,
9468,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"Browning made the only apparent trace of Sordello left in the world, the"
9469,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"snatch of song which the peasants sing on the hillside. Yet, though his"
9470,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"name be lost, the poet's immortality is sure. For like Socrates in the"
9471,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"_Symposium_, his desire is not merely for a fleeting vision of"
9472,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"beauty, but for birth and generation in beauty. And the beauty which he"
9473,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,is enabled to bring into the world will never cease to propagate itself.
9474,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,"So, though he be as fragile as a windflower, he may assure himself,"
9475,THE PRAGMATIC ISSUE,

9486,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9487,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9488,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Not even a paper shortage has been potent to give the lie to the author
9489,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"of _Ecclesiastes_, but it has fanned into flame the long smouldering"
9490,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,resentment of those who are wearily conscious that of making many books
9491,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,there is no end. No longer is any but the most confirmed writer suffered
9492,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,to spin out volume after volume in complacent ignorance of his readers'
9493,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"state of mind, for these victims of eye-strain and nerves turn upon the"
9494,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"newest book, the metaphorical last straw on the camel's load, with the"
9495,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"exasperated cry, Why? Why? and again Why?"
9496,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9497,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"Fortunately for themselves, most of the poets who have taken the poet's"
9498,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"character as their theme, indulged their weakness for words before that"
9499,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"long-suffering bookworm, the reader, had turned, but one who at the"
9500,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,present day drags from cobwebby corners the accusive mass of material on
9501,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"the subject, must seek to justify, not merely the loquacity of its"
9502,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"authors, but one's own temerity as well, in forcing it a second time"
9503,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,upon the jaded attention of the public.
9504,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9505,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,If one had been content merely to make an anthology of poems dealing
9506,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"with the poet, one's deed would perhaps have been easier to excuse, for"
9507,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,the public has been so often assured that anthologies are an economical
9508,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"form of publication, and a time-saving form of predigested food, that it"
9509,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,usually does not stop to consider whether the material was worth
9510,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,collecting in the first place. Gleaner after gleaner has worked in the
9511,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"field of English literature, sorting and sifting, until almost the last"
9512,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"grain, husk, straw and thistle have been gathered and stored with their"
9513,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"kind. But instead of making an anthology, we have gone on the assumption"
9514,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,that something more than accidental identity of subject-matter holds
9515,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,together the apparently desultory remarks of poets on the subject of the
9516,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"poet's eyebrows, his taste in liquors, his addiction to midnight"
9517,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"rambles, and whatnot. We have followed a labyrinthine path through the"
9518,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"subject with faith that, if we were but patient in observing the clues,"
9519,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,we should finally emerge at a point of vantage on the other side of the
9520,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,woods.
9521,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9522,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,The primary grounds of this faith may have appeared to the skeptic
9523,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"ridiculously inadequate. Our faith was based upon the fact that, more"
9524,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"than two thousand years ago, a serious accusation had been made against"
9525,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"poets, against which they had been challenged to defend themselves. This"
9526,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,led us to conclude that there must be unity of intention in poetry
9527,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"dealing with the poet, for we believed that when English poets talked of"
9528,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"themselves and their craft, they were attempting to remove the stigma"
9529,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,placed upon the name of poet by Plato's charge.
9530,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9531,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Now it is easy for a doubter to object that many of the poems on the
9532,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"subject show the poet, not arraying evidence for a trial, but leaning"
9533,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,over the brink of introspection in the attitude of Narcissus. One need
9534,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"seek no farther than self-love, it may be suggested, to find the motive"
9535,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,for the poet's absorption in his reflection. Yet it is incontrovertible
9536,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,that the self-infatuation of our Narcissus has its origin in the
9537,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"conviction that no one else understands him, and that this conviction is"
9538,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,founded upon a very real attitude of hostility on the part of his
9539,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,companions. The lack of sympathy between the English poet and the public
9540,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,is so notorious that Edmund Gosse is able to state as a truism:
9541,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,While in France poetry has been accustomed to reflect the
9542,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"general tongue of the people, the great poets of England have"
9543,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,almost always had to struggle against a complete dissonance
9544,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,between their own aims and interests and those of the nation.
9545,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"The result has been that England, the most inartistic of the"
9546,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"modern races, has produced the largest number of exquisite"
9547,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"literary artists. [Footnote: _French Profiles_, p. 344.]"
9548,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9549,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"Furthermore, even though everyone may agree that a lurking sense of"
9550,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"hostile criticism is back of the poet's self-absorption, another ground"
9551,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,for skepticism may lie in our assumption that Plato is the central
9552,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,figure in the opposition. It is usually with purpose to excite the envy
9553,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"of contemporary enemies that poets call attention to their graces, the"
9554,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,student may discover. Frequently the quarrels leading them to flaunt
9555,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,their personalities in their verses have arisen over the most personal
9556,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"and ephemeral of issues. Indeed, we may have appeared to falsify in"
9557,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"classifying their enemies under general heads, when for Christopher"
9558,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"North, Judson, Belfair, Friend Naddo, Richard Bame, we substituted faces"
9559,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"of cipher foolishness, abstractions which we named the puritan, the"
9560,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"philosopher, the philistine. Possibly by so doing we have given the"
9561,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,impression that poets are beating the air against an abstraction when
9562,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,they are in reality delivering thumping blows upon the body of a
9563,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"personal enemy. And if these generalizations appear indefensible, still"
9564,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"more misleading, it may be urged, is an attempt to represent that the"
9565,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"poet, when he takes issue with this and that opponent, is answering a"
9566,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,challenge hidden away from the unstudious in the tenth book of Plato's
9567,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,_Republic_. It is doubtful even whether a number of our poets are
9568,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"aware of the existence of Plato's challenge, and much more doubtful"
9569,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,whether they have it in mind as they write.
9570,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9571,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"Second thought must make it clear, however, that to prove ignorance of"
9572,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Plato's accusation on the part of one poet and another does not at all
9573,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,impair the possibility that it is his accusation which they are
9574,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,answering. So multiple are the threads of influence leading from the
9575,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,_Republic_ through succeeding literatures and civilizations that it
9576,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"is unsafe to assert, offhand, that any modern expression of hostility to"
9577,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"poetry may not be traced, by a patient untangler of evidence, to a"
9578,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,source in the _Republic_. But even this is aside from the point.
9579,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,One might concede that the wide-spread modern antagonism to poetry would
9580,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"have been the same if Plato had never lived, and still maintain that in"
9581,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,the _Republic_ is expressed for all time whatever in anti-aesthetic
9582,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,criticism is worthy of a serious answer. Whether poets themselves are
9583,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"aware of it or not, we have a right to assert that in concerning"
9584,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"themselves with the character of the ideal poet, they are responding to"
9585,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Plato's challenge.
9586,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9587,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,This may not be enough to justify our faith that these defensive
9588,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,expositions lead us anywhere. Let us agree that certain poets of the
9589,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,nineteenth and twentieth centuries have answered Plato's challenge. But
9590,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,has the Poet likewise answered it? If from their independent efforts to
9591,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,paint the ideal poet there has emerged a portrait as sculpturally clear
9592,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"in outline as is Plato's portrait of the ideal philosopher, we shall"
9593,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"perhaps be justified in saying, Yes, the Poet, through a hundred mouths,"
9594,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,has spoken.
9595,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9596,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"Frankly, the composite picture which we have been considering has not"
9597,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,sculptural clarity. To the casual observer it bears less resemblance to
9598,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,an alto-relief than to a mosaic; no sooner do distinct patterns spring
9599,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,out of myriad details than they shift under the onlooker's eyes to a
9600,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,totally different form. All that we can claim for the picture is
9601,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"excellence as a piece of impressionism, which one must scan with"
9602,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"half-closed eyes at a calculated distance, if one would appreciate its"
9603,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,central conception.
9604,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9605,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Apparently readers of English poetry have not taken the trouble to scan
9606,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,it with such care. They may excuse their indifference by declaring that
9607,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,an attempt to discover a common aesthetic principle in a collection of
9608,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,views as catholic as those with which we have dealt is as absurd as an
9609,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,attempt to discover philosophical truth by taking a census of general
9610,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"opinion. Still, obvious as are the limitations of a popular vote in"
9611,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"determining an issue, it has a certain place in the discovery of truth."
9612,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,One would not entirely despise the benefit derived from a general survey
9613,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"of philosophers' convictions, for instance. Into the conclusions of each"
9614,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"philosopher, even of the greatest, there are bound to enter certain"
9615,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"personal whimsicalities of thought, which it is profitable to eliminate,"
9616,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,by finding the common elements in the thought of several men. If the
9617,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,quest of a universal least common denominator forces one to give up
9618,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"everything that is of significance in the views of philosophers, there"
9619,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"is profit, at least, in learning that the title of philosopher does not"
9620,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,carry with it a guarantee of truth-telling. On the other hand if we find
9621,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"universal recognition of some fundamental truth, a common _cogito ergo"
9622,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"sum_, or the like, acknowledged by all philosophers, we have made a"
9623,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,discovery as satisfactory in its way as is acceptance of the complex
9624,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,system of philosophy offered by Plato or Descartes. There seems to be no
9625,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,real reason why it should not be quite as worth while to take a similar
9626,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,census of the views of poets.
9627,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9628,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,After hearkening to the general suffrage of poets on the question of the
9629,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"poet's character, we must bring a serious charge against them if a"
9630,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,deafening clamor of contradiction reverberates in our ears. In such a
9631,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"case their claim that they are seers, or masters of harmony, can be"
9632,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,worth little. The unbiased listener is likely to assure us that
9633,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,clamorous contradiction is precisely what the aggregate of poets'
9634,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"speaking amounts to, but we shall be slow to acknowledge as much. Have"
9635,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,we been merely the dupe of pretty phrasing when we felt ourselves
9636,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,insured against discord by the testimony of Keats? Hear him:
9637,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9638,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,How many bards gild the lapses of time!
9639,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,*       *       *       *       *
9640,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"... Often, when I sit me down to rhyme,"
9641,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"These will in throngs before my mind intrude,"
9642,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"But no confusion, no disturbance rude"
9643,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Do they occasion; 'tis a pleasing chime.
9644,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9645,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,However incompatible the characteristics of the poets celebrated by
9646,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"Wordsworth and by Swinburne, by Christina Rossetti and by Walt Whitman"
9647,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"may have seemed in immediate juxtaposition, we have trusted that we need"
9648,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"only retire to a position where ""distance of recognizance bereaves"""
9649,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"their individual voices, in order to detect in their mingled notes"
9650,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"""pleasing music, and not wild uproar."""
9651,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9652,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,The critic who condemns as wholly discordant the variant notes of our
9653,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,multitudinous verse-writers may point out that we should have had more
9654,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,right to expect concord if we had shown some discernment in sifting true
9655,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,poets from false. Those who have least claim to the title of poet have
9656,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"frequently been most garrulous in voicing their convictions. Moreover,"
9657,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"these pseudo-poets outnumber genuine poets one hundred to one, yet no"
9658,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,one in his right mind would contend that their expressions of opinion
9659,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"represent more than a straw vote, if they conflict with the judgment of"
9660,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,a single true poet.
9661,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9662,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"Still, our propensity for listening to the rank breath of the multitude"
9663,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,is not wholly indefensible. In the first place pseudo-poets have not
9664,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,created so much discord as one might suppose. A lurking sense of their
9665,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,own worthlessness has made them timid of utterance except as they echo
9666,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,and prolong a note that has been struck repeatedly by singers of
9667,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"reputation. This echoing, it may be added, has sometimes been effective"
9668,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,in bringing the traditions of his craft to the attention of a young
9669,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"singer as yet unaware of them. Thus Bowles and Chivers, neither of whom"
9670,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"has very strong claim to the title of bard, yet were in a measure"
9671,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,responsible for the minor note in Coleridge's and Poe's description of
9672,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,the typical poet.
9673,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9674,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Even when the voices of spurious bards have failed to chime with the
9675,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"others, the resulting discord has not been of serious moment. A"
9676,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,counterfeit coin may be as good a touchstone for the detection of pure
9677,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"silver, as is pure silver for the detection of counterfeit. Not only are"
9678,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,a reader's views frequently clarified by setting a poetaster beside a
9679,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"poet as a foil, but poets themselves have clarified their views because"
9680,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,they have been incited by declarations in false verse to express their
9681,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,convictions more unreservedly than they should otherwise have done.
9682,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Pseudo-poets have sometimes been of genuine benefit by their
9683,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,exaggeration of some false note which they have adopted from poetry of
9684,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"the past. No sooner do they exaggerate such a note, than a concerted"
9685,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"shout of protest from true poets drowns the erroneous statement, and"
9686,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,corrects the misleading impression which careless statements in earlier
9687,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,verse might have left with us. Thus the morbid singer exhibited in minor
9688,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"American verse of the last century, and the vicious singer lauded in one"
9689,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"strain of English verse, performed a genuine service by calling forth"
9690,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"repudiation, by major poets, of traits which might easily lead a singer"
9691,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,in the direction of morbidity and vice.
9692,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9693,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,The confusion of sound which our critic complains of is not to be
9694,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,remedied merely by silencing the chorus of echoic voices. If we dropped
9695,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"from consideration all but poets of unquestionable merit, we should not"
9696,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"be more successful in detecting a single clear note, binding all their"
9697,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,voices together. When the ideal poet of Shelley is set against that of
9698,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"Byron, or that of Matthew Arnold against that of Browning, there is no"
9699,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,more unison than when great and small in the poetic world are allowed to
9700,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,speak indiscriminately.
9701,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9702,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"Does this prove that only the supreme poet speaks truly, and that we"
9703,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,must hush all voices but his if we would learn what is the essential
9704,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,element in the poetic character? Then we are indeed in a hard case.
9705,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,There is no unanimity of opinion among us regarding the supreme English
9706,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"poet of the last century, and if we dared follow personal taste in"
9707,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,declaring one of higher altitude than all the others only a small
9708,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,percentage of readers would be satisfied when we set up the _Prelude_ or
9709,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,_Adonais_ or _Childe Harold_ or _Sordello_ beside the _Republic_ as
9710,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,containing the one portrait of the ideal singer worthy to stand beside
9711,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,the portrait of the ideal philosopher. And this is not the worst of the
9712,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"difficulty. Even if we turn from Shelley to Byron, from Wordsworth to"
9713,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"Browning, in quest of the one satisfactory conception of the poet, we"
9714,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,shall not hear in anyone of their poems the single clear ringing note
9715,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,for which we are listening. When anyone of these men is considering the
9716,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"poetic character, his thought behaves like a pendulum, swinging back and"
9717,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,forth between two poles.
9718,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9719,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"Thus we ourselves have admitted the futility of our quest of truth, the"
9720,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"critic may conclude. But no, before we admit as much, let us see exactly"
9721,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,what constitutes the lack of unity which troubles us. After its
9722,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"persistence in verse of the same country, the same period, the same"
9723,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"tradition, the same poet, even, has led us to the brink of despair, its"
9724,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"further persistence rouses in us fresh hope, or at least intense"
9725,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"curiosity, for what impresses us as the swinging of a pendulum keeps up"
9726,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"its rhythmical beat, not merely in the mind of each poet, but in each"
9727,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"phase of his thought. We find the same measured antithesis of thought,"
9728,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"whether he is considering the singer's environment or his health, his"
9729,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,inspiration or his mission.
9730,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9731,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,In treatment even of the most superficial matters related to the poet's
9732,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"character, this vibration forces itself upon our attention. Poets are"
9733,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,sofar from subscribing to Taine's belief in the supreme importance of
9734,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,environment as molder of genius that the question of the singer's proper
9735,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"habitat is of comparative indifference to them, yet the dualism that we"
9736,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,have noted runs as true to form here as in more fundamental issues. When
9737,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,one takes the suffrage of poets in general on the question of
9738,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"environment, two voices are equally strong. Genius is fostered by"
9739,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"solitude, we hear; but again, genius is fostered by human companionship."
9740,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,At first we may assume that this divergence of view characterizes
9741,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"separate periods. Writers in the romantic period, we say, praised the"
9742,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,poet whose thought was turned inward by solitude; while writers in the
9743,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Victorian period praised the poet whose thought was turned upon the
9744,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,spectacle of human passions. But on finding that this classification is
9745,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"true only in the most general way, we go farther. Within the Victorian"
9746,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"period Browning, we say, is the advocate of the social poet, as Arnold"
9747,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,is the advocate of the solitary one. But still our classification is
9748,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,inadequate. Is Browning the expositor of the gregarious poet? It is true
9749,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"that he feels it necessary for the singer to ""look upon men and their"
9750,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"cares and hopes and fears and joys."" [Footnote: _Pauline_.] But he"
9751,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,makes Sordello flee like a hunted creature back to Goito and solitude in
9752,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,quest of renewed inspiration. Is Arnold the expositor of the solitary
9753,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"poet? True, he urges him to fly from ""the strange disease of modern"
9754,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"life"". [Footnote: _The Scholar Gypsy_.] Yet he preaches that the"
9755,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,duty of the poet is
9756,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9757,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,to scan
9758,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"Not his own course, but that of man."
9759,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,[Footnote: _Resignation_.]
9760,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9761,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Within the romantic period the same phenomenon is evident. Does
9762,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Wordsworth paint the ideal poet dwelling apart from human distractions?
9763,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"Yet he declares that his deepest insight is gained by listening to ""the"
9764,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"still sad music of humanity"". In Keats, Shelley, Byron, the same"
9765,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,antithesis of thought is not less evident.
9766,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9767,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"We cannot justly conclude that a compromise between contradictions, an"
9768,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"avoidance of extremes, is what anyone of these poets stands for. It is"
9769,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"complete absorption in the drame of human life that makes one a poet,"
9770,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"they aver; but again, it is complete isolation that allows the inmost"
9771,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,poetry of one's nature to rise to consciousness. At the same time they
9772,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,make it clear that the supreme poet needs the gifts of both
9773,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"environments. To quote Walt Whitman,"
9774,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9775,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"What the full-grown poet came,"
9776,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Out spake pleased Nature (the round impassive globe
9777,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"with all its shows of day and night) saying, He"
9778,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,is mine;
9779,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"But out spake too the Soul of men, proud, jealous"
9780,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"and unreconciled, Nay, he is mine alone;"
9781,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,--Then the full-grown poet stood between the two and
9782,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,took each by the hand;
9783,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"And today and ever so stands, as blender, uniter, tightly"
9784,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"holding hands,"
9785,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"Which he will never release till he reconciles the two,"
9786,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,And wholly and joyously blends them.
9787,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9788,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"The paradox in poets' views was equally perplexing, no matter what phase"
9789,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,of the poetic character was considered. A mere resumé of the topics
9790,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,discussed in these essays is enough to make the two horns of the dilemma
9791,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,obtrude themselves. Did we consider the financial status of the poet? We
9792,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,heard that he should experience all the luxurious sensations that wealth
9793,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,can bring; on the other hand we heard that his poverty should shield him
9794,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,from distractions that might call him away from accumulation of
9795,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,spiritual treasure. Did we consider the poet's age? We heard that the
9796,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,freshness of sensation possessed only by youth carries the secret of
9797,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,poetry; on the other hand we heard that the secret lies in depth of
9798,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,spiritual insight possible only to old age. So in the allied question of
9799,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,the poet's body. He should have
9800,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9801,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,The dress
9802,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Of flesh that amply lets in loveliness
9803,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"At eye and ear,"
9804,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9805,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,that no beauty in the physical world may escape him. Yet he should be
9806,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"absorbed in the other world to such a degree that blindness, even, is a"
9807,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"blessing to him, enabling him to ""see, no longer blinded by his eyes."""
9808,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,The question of the poet's health arose. He should have the exuberance
9809,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"and aplomb of the young animal; no, he should have a body frail enough"
9810,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"to enable him, like the mediæval mystic, to escape from its"
9811,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,importunatedemands upon the spirit.
9812,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9813,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"In the more fundamental questions that poets considered, relating to the"
9814,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"poet's temperament, his loves, his inspiration, his morality, his"
9815,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"religion, his mission, the same cleavage invariably appeared. What"
9816,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,constitutes the poetic temperament? It is a fickle interchange of joy
9817,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"and grief, for the poet is lifted on the wave of each new sensation; it"
9818,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"is an imperturbable serenity, for the poet dwells apart with the eternal"
9819,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,verities. What is the distinguishing characteristic of his love? The
9820,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"object of his worship must be embodied, passionate, yet his desire is"
9821,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,for purely spiritual union with her. What is the nature of his
9822,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,inspiration? It fills him with trancelike impassivity to sensation; it
9823,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,comes upon him with such overwhelming sensation that he must touch the
9824,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,walls to see whether they or his visions are the reality. [Footnote: See
9825,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"Christopher Wordsworth, _Memoirs of Wordsworth_, Vol. II, p. 480.]"
9826,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,How is his moral life different from that of other men? He is more
9827,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"fiercely tempted, because he is more sensitive to human passions; he is"
9828,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,shut away from all temptations because his interest is solely in the
9829,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,principle of beauty. What is the nature of his religious instinct? He is
9830,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,mad with thirst for God; he will have no God but his own humanity. What
9831,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,is his mission? He must awaken men to the wonder of the physical world
9832,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,and fit them to abide therein; he must redeem them from physical
9833,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"bondage, and open their eyes to the spiritual world."
9834,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9835,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,The impatient listener to this lengthy catalogue of the poet's views may
9836,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,assert that it has no significance. It merely shows that there are many
9837,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"kinds of poets, who attempt to imitate many aspects of human life. But"
9838,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,surely our catalogue does not show just this. There is no multiform
9839,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,picture of the poet here. The pendulum of his desire vibrates
9840,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"undeviatingly between two points only. Sense and spirit, spirit and"
9841,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"sense, the pulse of his nature seems to reiterate incessantly. There is"
9842,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,no poet so absorbed in sensation that physical objects do not
9843,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,occasionally fade into unreality when he compares them with the spirit
9844,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"of life. Even Walt Whitman, most sensuous of all our poets, exclaims,"
9845,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9846,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Sometimes how strange and clear to the soul
9847,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"That all these solid things are indeed but apparitions,"
9848,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"concepts, non-realities."
9849,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,[Footnote: _Apparitions_.]
9850,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9851,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,On the other hand there is no poet whose taste is so purely spiritual
9852,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"that he is indifferent to sensation. The idealism of Wordsworth, even,"
9853,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,did not preclude his finding in sensation
9854,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9855,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"An appetite, a feeling and a love"
9856,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,That had no need of a remoter charm
9857,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,By thought supplied.
9858,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9859,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"Is this systole and diastole of the affection from sense to spirit, from"
9860,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"spirit to sense, peculiarly characteristic of English poets? There may"
9861,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,be some reason for assuming that it is. Historians have repeatedly
9862,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"pointed out that there are two strains in the English blood, the one"
9863,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"northern and ascetic, the other southern and epicurean. In the modern"
9864,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,English poet the austere prophetic character of the Norse scald is
9865,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,wedded to the impressionability of the troubadour. No wonder there is a
9866,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,battle in his breast when he tries to single out one element or the
9867,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"other as his most distinctive quality of soul. Yet, were it not unsafe"
9868,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"to generalize when our data apply to only one country, we should venture"
9869,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,the assertion that the dualism of the poet's desires is not an insular
9870,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"characteristic, but is typical of his race in every country."
9871,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9872,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"Because the poet is drawn equally to this world and to the other world,"
9873,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"shall we characterize him as a hybrid creature, and assert that an"
9874,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,irreconcilable discord is in his soul? We shall prove ourselves
9875,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,singularly deaf to concord if we do so. Poets have been telling us over
9876,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,and over again that the distinctive element in the poetic nature is
9877,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"harmony. What is harmony? It is the reconciliation of opposites, says"
9878,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Eurymachus in the _Symposium_. It is union of the finite and the
9879,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"infinite, says Socrates in the _Philebus_. Do the poet's desires"
9880,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"point in opposite directions? But so, it seems, do the poplars that"
9881,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"stand tiptoe, breathless, at the edge of the dreaming pool. The whole"
9882,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,secret of the aesthetic repose lies in the duality of the poet's desire.
9883,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"His imagination enables him to see all life as two in one, or one in"
9884,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,two; he leaves us uncertain which. His imagination reflects the
9885,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,spiritual in the sensual and the sensual in the spiritual till we cannot
9886,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,tell which is the more tangible or the more meaningful. We sought unity
9887,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"in the poetic character, but we can reduce a nature to complete and"
9888,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"barren unity only by draining it of imagination, and it is imagination"
9889,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,which enables the poet to find aesthetic unity in the two worlds of
9890,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"sense and spirit, where the rest of us can see only conflict. There is a"
9891,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"little poem, by Walter Conrad Arensberg, which is to me a symbol of this"
9892,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,power of reflection which distinguishes the poetic imagination. It is
9893,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,called _Voyage à L'Infine_:
9894,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9895,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,The swan existing
9896,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Is like a song with an accompaniment
9897,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Imaginary.
9898,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9899,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"Across the grassy lake,"
9900,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Across the lake to the shadow of the willows
9901,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"It is accompanied by an image,"
9902,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,--as by Debussy's
9903,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"""Réflets dans l'eau."""
9904,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9905,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,The swan that is
9906,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Reflects
9907,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Upon the solitary water--breast to breast
9908,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,With the duplicity:
9909,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"""The other one!"""
9910,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9911,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,And breast to breast it is confused.
9912,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,O visionary wedding! O stateliness of the procession!
9913,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,It is accompanied by the image of itself
9914,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Alone.
9915,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9916,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,At night
9917,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"The lake is a wide silence,"
9918,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Without imagination.
9919,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9920,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"But why should poets assume, someone may object, that this mystic"
9921,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,answering of sense to spirit and of spirit to sense is to be discovered
9922,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,by the imagination of none but poets? All men are made up of flesh and
9923,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"spirit; do not the desires of all men, accordingly, point to the"
9924,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"spiritual and to the physical, exactly as do the poet's? In a sense;"
9925,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,yes; but on the other hand all men but the poet have an aim that is
9926,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,clearly either physical or spiritual; therefore they do not stand poised
9927,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,between the two worlds with the perfect balance of interests which marks
9928,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,the poet. The philosopher and the man of religion recognize their goal
9929,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,as a spiritual and ascetic one. If they concern themselves more than is
9930,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"needful with the temporal and sensual, they feel that they are false to"
9931,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"their ideal. The scientist and the man of affairs, on the other hand,"
9932,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,are concerned with the physical; therefore most of the time they dismiss
9933,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,consideration of the spiritual as being outside of their province. Of
9934,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,course many persons would disagree with this last statement. The genius
9935,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"of an Edison, they assert, is precisely like the genius of a poet. But"
9936,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"if this were true, we should be moved by the mechanism of a phonograph"
9937,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"just as we are moved by a poem, and we are not. We may be amazed by the"
9938,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"invention, and still find our thoughts tied to the physical world. It is"
9939,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"not the instrument, but the voice of an artist added to it that makes us"
9940,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"conscious of the two worlds of sense and spirit, reflecting one another."
9941,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9942,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"Supposing that all this is true, what is gained by discovering, from a"
9943,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"consensus of poets' views, that the distinctive characteristic of the"
9944,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,poet is harmony of sense and spirit? Is not this so obvious as to be a
9945,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,truism? It is perhaps so obvious that like all the truest things in the
9946,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,world it is likely to be ignored unless insisted upon occasionally.
9947,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Certainly it has been ignored too frequently in the history of English
9948,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,criticism. Whenever men of simpler aims than the poet have written
9949,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"criticism, they have misread the issue in various ways, and have usually"
9950,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,ended by condemning the poet in so far as he diverged from their own
9951,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,goal.
9952,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9953,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,It is obvious that the moral obsession which has twisted so much of
9954,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,English criticism is the result of a failure to grasp the real nature of
9955,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"the poet's vitality. Criticism arose, with Gosson's _School of"
9956,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"Abuse_, as an attack upon the ethics of the poet by the puritan, who"
9957,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,had cut himself off from the joys of sense. Because champions of poetry
9958,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"were concerned with answering this attack, the bulk of Elizabethan"
9959,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"criticism, that of Lodge, [Footnote: _Defense of Poetry, Musick and"
9960,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"Stage Plays._] Harrington, [Footnote: _Apology for Poetry._] Meres,"
9961,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"[Footnote: _Palladis Tamia._] Campion, [Footnote: _Observations in the"
9962,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"Art of English Poetry._] Daniel, [Footnote: _Defense of Rhyme._] and"
9963,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"even in lesser degree of Sidney, obscures the aesthetic problem by"
9964,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,turning it into an ethical one.
9965,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9966,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"In the criticism of Sidney, himself a poet, one does find implied a"
9967,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,recognition of the twofold significance of the poet's powers. He asserts
9968,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"his spiritual pre-eminence strongly, declaring that the poet, unlike the"
9969,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"scientist, is not bound to the physical world.[Footnote: ""He is not"
9970,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"bound to any such subjection, as scientists, to nature."" _Defense of"
9971,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Poetry._] On the other hand he is clearly aware of the need for a
9972,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"sensuous element in poetry, since by it, Sidney declares, the poet may"
9973,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"lead men by ""delight"" to follow the forms of virtue."
9974,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9975,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"The next critic of note, Dryden, in his revulsion from the ascetic"
9976,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"character which the puritans would develop in the poet, swung too far to"
9977,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"the other extreme, and threw the poetic character out of balance by"
9978,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,belittling its spiritual insight. He did justice to the physical element
9979,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"in poetry, defining poetic drama, the type of his immediate concern, as"
9980,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"""a just and lively image of human nature, in its actions, passions, and"
9981,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"traverses of fortune,"" [Footnote: _English Garner,_ III, 513.] but"
9982,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,he appears to have felt the ideal aspect of the poet's nature as merely
9983,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"a negation of the sensual, so that he was driven to the absurdity of"
9984,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"recommending a purely mechanical device, rhyme, as a means of elevating"
9985,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"poetry above the sordid plane of ""a bare imitation."" In the eighteenth"
9986,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"century, Edmund Burke likewise laid too much stress upon the physical"
9987,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"aspect of the poet's nature, in accounting for the sublime in poetry as"
9988,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"originating in the sense of pain, and the beautiful as originating in"
9989,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,pleasure. Yet he comes closer than most critics to laying his finger
9990,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"onthe particular point which distinguishes poets from philosophers,"
9991,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"namely, their dependence upon sensation."
9992,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
9993,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"With the single exception of Burke, however, the critics of the"
9994,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,eighteenth century labored under a misapprehension no less blind than
9995,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,the moral obsession which twisted Elizabethan criticism. In the
9996,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,eighteenth century critics were prone to confuse the spiritual element
9997,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"in the poet's nature with intellectualism, and the sensuous element with"
9998,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,emotionalism. Such criticism tended to drive the poet either into an
9999,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"arid display of wit, on the one hand, or into sentimental excess, on the"
10000,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"other, and the native English distrust of emotion led eighteenth century"
10001,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,critics to praise the poet when the intellect had the upper hand. But
10002,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,surely poets have made it clear enough that the intellect is not the
10003,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,distinctive characteristic of the poet. To be intelligent is merely to
10004,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"be human. Intelligence is only a tool, poets have repeatedly insisted,"
10005,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,in their quarrel with philosophers. In proportion as one is intelligent
10006,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"within one's own field, one excels, poets would admit. If one is"
10007,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,intelligent with respect to fisticuffs one is likely to become a good
10008,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"prize-fighter, but no matter how far refinement of intelligence goes in"
10009,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"this direction, it will not make a pugilist into a poet. Intelligence"
10010,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"must belong likewise, in signal degree, to the great poet, but it is"
10011,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,neither one of the two essential elements in his nature. Augustan
10012,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"critics starved the spiritual element in poetry, even while they"
10013,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"imagined that they were feeding it, for in sharpening his wit the poet"
10014,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"came no nearer expressing the ""poor soul, the center of his sinful"
10015,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"earth"" than when he reveled in emotion. We no longer believe that in the"
10016,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,most truly poetic nature the intelligence of a Pope is joined with the
10017,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,emotionalism of a Rousseau. We believe that the spirituality of a
10018,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Crashaw is blent with the sensuousness of a Swinburne.
10019,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
10020,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"Nineteenth century criticism, since it is almost entirely the work of"
10021,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"poets, should not be thus at odds with the conception of the poet"
10022,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,expressed in poetry. But although nineteenth century prose criticism
10023,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"moves in the right direction, it is not entirely adequate. The poet is"
10024,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,not at his best when he is working in a prose medium. He works too
10025,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"consciously in prose, hence his intuitive flashes are not likely to find"
10026,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"expression. After he has tried to express his buried life there, he"
10027,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"himself is likely to warn us that what he has said ""is well, is"
10028,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"eloquent, but 'tis not true."" Even Shelley, the most successful of"
10029,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"poet-critics, gives us a more vivid comprehension of the poetical"
10030,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,balance of sense and spirit through his poet-heroes than through _The
10031,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"Defense of Poetry_, for he is almost exclusively concerned, in that"
10032,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"essay, with the spiritual aspect of poetry. He expresses, in fact, the"
10033,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,converse of Dryden's view in that he regards the sensuous as negation or
10034,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,dross merely. He asserts:
10035,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
10036,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Few poets of the highest class have chosen to exhibit the
10037,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"beauty of their conception in naked truth and splendor, and it"
10038,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"is doubtful whether the alloy of costume, habit, etc., be not"
10039,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,necessary to temper this planetary music to mortal ears.
10040,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
10041,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,The harmony in Shelley's nature which made it possible for his
10042,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"contemporaries to believe him a gross sensualist, and succeeding"
10043,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"generations to believe him an angel, is better expressed by Browning,"
10044,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,who says:
10045,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
10046,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,His noblest characteristic I call his simultaneous perception
10047,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"of Power and Love in the absolute, and of beauty and good in"
10048,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"the concrete, while he throws, from his poet-station between"
10049,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"them both, swifter, subtler and more numerous films for the"
10050,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,connection of each with each than have been thrown by any
10051,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,modern artificer of whom I have knowledge.[Footnote: Preface
10052,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,to the letters of Shelley (afterward found spurious).]
10053,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
10054,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"Yet Browning, likewise, gives a more illuminating picture of the poetic"
10055,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,nature in his poetry than in his prose.
10056,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
10057,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,The peculiar merit of poetry about the poet is that it makes a valuable
10058,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,supplement to prose criticism. We have been tempted to deny that such
10059,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"poetry is the highest type of art. It has seemed that poets, when they"
10060,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"are introspective and analytical of their gift, are not in the highest"
10061,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"poetic mood. But when we are on the quest of criticism, instead of"
10062,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"poetry, we are frankly grateful for such verse. It is analytical enough"
10063,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"to be intelligible to us, and still intuitive enough to convince us of"
10064,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,its truthfulness. Wordsworth's _Prelude_ has been condemned in
10065,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"certain quarters as ""a talking about poetry, not poetry itself,"" but in"
10066,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"part, at least, the _Prelude_ is truly poetry. For this reason it"
10067,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,gives us more valuable ideas about the nature of poetry than does the
10068,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,_Preface to the Lyrical Ballads_. If it is worth while to analyze
10069,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"the poetic character at all, then poetry on the poet is invaluable to"
10070,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,us.
10071,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
10072,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,Perhaps it is too much for us to decide whether the picture of the poet
10073,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,at which we have been gazing is worthy to be placed above Plato's
10074,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,picture of the philosopher. The poet does not contradict Plato's charge
10075,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,against him. His self-portrait bears out the accusation that he is
10076,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"unable to see ""the divine beauty--pure and clear and unalloyed, not"
10077,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"clogged with the pollutions of mortality, and all the colors and"
10078,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"varieties of human life."" [Footnote: _Symposium_, 212.] Plato would"
10079,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,agree with the analysis of the poetic character that Keats once
10080,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"struggled with, when he exclaimed,"
10081,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
10082,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"What quality went to form a man of achievement, especially in"
10083,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"literature, and which Shakespeare possessed so enormously--I mean"
10084,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"_Negative Capability_, that is, when a man is capable of being in"
10085,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after"
10086,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"fact and reason. Coleridge, for instance, would let go by a fine"
10087,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"isolated verisimilitude caught from the Pentralium of mystery, from"
10088,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,being incapable of remaining content with half-knowledge--With a great
10089,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"poet the sense of Beauty overcomes every other consideration, or rather"
10090,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,obliterates all consideration.
10091,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
10092,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"Plato would agree with this,--all but the last sentence. Only, in place"
10093,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"of the phrase ""negative capability,"" he would substitute ""incapability,"""
10094,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,and reflect that the poet fails to see absolute beauty because he is not
10095,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,content to leave the sensual behind and press on to absolute reality.
10096,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
10097,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"It may be that Plato is right, yet one cannot help wishing that sometime"
10098,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,a poet may arise of greater power of persuasion than any with whom we
10099,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"have dealt, who will prove to Plato what he appears ever longing to be"
10100,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"convinced of, that absolute ideality is not a negation of the sensual,"
10101,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"and that poetry, in revealing the union of sense and spirit, is the"
10102,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,strongest proof of idealism that we possess. A poet may yet arise who
10103,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,will prove that he is right in refusing to acknowledge that this world
10104,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,is merely a surface upon which is reflected the ideals which constitute
10105,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,reality and which abide in a different realm. The assumption in that
10106,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"conception is that, if men have spiritual vision, they may apprehend"
10107,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"ideals directly, altogether apart from sense. On the contrary, the"
10108,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,impression given by the poet is that ideality constitutes the very
10109,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"essence of the so-called physical world, and that this essence is"
10110,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,continually striving to express itself through refinement and remolding
10111,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"of the outer crust of things. So, when the world of sense comes to"
10112,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"express perfectly the ideal, it will not be a mere representation of"
10113,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"reality. It will be reality. If he can prove this, we must acknowledge"
10114,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"that, not the rationalistic philosopher, but the poet, grasps reality"
10115,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,_in toto_.
10116,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,
10117,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"However inconclusive his proof, the claims of the poet must fascinate"
10118,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"one with their implications. The two aspects of human life, the physical"
10119,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"and the ideal, focus in the poet, and the result is the harmony which is"
10120,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"art. The fact is of profound philosophical significance, surely, for"
10121,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,union of the apparent contradictions of the sensual and the spiritual
10122,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,can only mean that idealism is of the essence of the universe. What is
10123,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,the poetic metaphor but the revelation of an identical meaning in the
10124,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,physical and spiritual world? The sympathetic reader of poetry cannot
10125,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"but see the reflection of the spiritual in the sensual, and the sensual"
10126,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,"in the spiritual, even as does the poet, and one, as the other, must be"
10127,A SOBER AFTERTHOUGHT,by temperament an idealist.
