6,,"The sky is dull and grey, Piercing and chill the blast, Each step resounds on the frosty ground, Winter is come at last. "
7,,*       *       *       *       * 
8,,"Mamma sits by the fire Her little ones round her knees. ""How cosy we are, Mamma,"" they cry, ""Tell us something, if you please."" "
9,,[Illustration] 
10,,[Illustration] 
11,,"""Tell us about King Winter, And about Jack Frost, his man; We'll not be noisy or naughty at all, But as good as ever we can."" "
12,,*       *       *       *       * 
13,,"""Well then;"" says mamma, ""you, Jenny, May knit and listen, my dear; And Johnny may split up wood, to make The fire burn bright and clear."" "

16,,"King Winter dwells in the North; Far away in the Frozen Zone, In a palace of snow he holds his court, And sits on an icy throne. "
17,,*       *       *       *       * 
18,,"He has cushions of course: his Queen Made them out of her wedding gown. Stuffing them well with snowflakes fine, And soft as eiderdown. "
19,,[Illustration] 
20,,[Illustration] 
21,,"The King has a trusty servant, Jack Frost is his name; his nose Is raspberry red, his beard is white, And stiff as a crutch it grows. "
22,,*       *       *       *       * 
23,,"Old Jack is a sturdy good fellow, And serves their Majesties well; He's here and he's there, and he's everywhere, And does more than I can tell. "
24,,[Illustration] 
25,,[Illustration] 
26,,"Each year, as the day comes round, The king and his royal train Set off on a tour through the wide wide world, And sweep over mountain and plain. "
27,,*       *       *       *       * 
28,,"His Majesty fails not to visit Every clime that's not too hot, To look in upon both high and low, From the palace down to the cot. "
29,,[Illustration] 
30,,[Illustration] 
31,,"Jack Frost has a busy time then, But he's helped and advised by the Queen, That all may be right when the King goes forth, And everything fit to be seen. "
32,,*       *       *       *       * 
33,,"That the King may have pleasant travel, And no stone hurt his royal toe, Her Majesty spreads all over the earth, A carpet of downy snow. "
34,,[Illustration] 
35,,[Illustration] 
36,,Fine mirrors the King delights in: None are finer than Jack can make: And in matchless sheets of crystal clear He lays them on river and lake. 
37,,*       *       *       *       * 
38,,"The trees, all naked and drear, He robes in the purest white, And with icicles shining with rainbow hues, He makes their branches bright. "
39,,[Illustration] 
40,,[Illustration] 
41,,"And for want of buds and blossoms To strew in his Majesty's way, With magic flowers of his own device He makes the windows gay. "
42,,*       *       *       *       * 
43,,"These wonders wrought in a single night May well excite surprise; Amazed is the sun when he gets up at dawn, And he stares with all his eyes. "
44,,[Illustration] 
45,,[Illustration] 
46,,"Then out come all the boys and girls, Jack's handiwork to view, And their noses and cheeks turn red with cold, Some of them even turn blue. "
47,,*       *       *       *       * 
48,,"They pelt each other with snow, Roll it up in a mighty ball, And shout and laugh and scamper about, And heels over head they fall. "
49,,[Illustration] 
50,,[Illustration] 
51,,"They make a huge man of snow, As grand as a Russian Czar, A wooden sword in his hand, in his mouth, A carrot to serve for cigar. "
52,,*       *       *       *       * 
53,,"His eyes, his hair, and his beard, They paint as black as my shoe With burnt stick, but they spoil his nose, For they stick it rather askew. "
54,,[Illustration] 
55,,[Illustration] 
56,,"Then what do you think? For a cockshot They take him; they pelt him and hit; They knock of the snowman's ears and nose, But he does not mind it a bit. "
57,,*       *       *       *       * 
58,,"Hurrah! for the good thick ice. Oh! isn't it jolly? They slide, They skate, and in sleighs so fine they go, And swift as the wind they glide. "
59,,[Illustration] 
60,,[Illustration] 
61,,"King Winter laughs at the sport, Cries ""Bravo!"" and claps his hands, And calling in haste for his man, Jack Frost, He gives him these commands: "
62,,*       *       *       *       * 
63,,"""Go see the papas and mammas, And bring me word what they say: Have the children been good and well behaved, Since last I came this way?"" "
64,,[Illustration] 
65,,[Illustration] 
66,,"The King trims Christmas trees, To give to good girls and boys, With tapers and trinkets of silver and gold, And all sorts of dainties and toys. "
67,,*       *       *       *       * 
68,,"The Queen cuts twigs of birch, Of birch so supple and keen, And daintily ties them up into rods The finest that ever were seen. "
69,,[Illustration] 
70,,[Illustration] 
71,,"Soon with this word to the King Jack Frost comes back at a trot: ""Good have most of the children been, But some of them have not."" "
72,,*       *       *       *       * 
73,,"The King gives him the pretty trees, The Queen the rods so smart, And away goes Jack again with his load, Till every house has its part. "
74,,[Illustration] 
75,,[Illustration] 
76,,"Cakes, mince-pies nuts and apples, Good children get from the King. You can guess what the naughty get, The rods are the only thing. "
77,,*       *       *       *       * 
78,,"""Oh dear mamma,"" cries Jenny, ""Johnny's been good, and so have I! Pray tell Jack Frost we don't want the rod, Oh! do ask him to put it by."" "
79,,[Illustration] 
80,,[Illustration] 
81,,"Mamma smiles on her darlings, They run to her, kiss her, and say: ""How long do you think will it be, Mamma, Ere King Winter goes away?"" "
82,,*       *       *       *       * 
83,,"""He will lay upon Baby's cradle The snowdrops that early come forth; And then, my dears, he will bid us good bye And go back to his home in the North."" "
