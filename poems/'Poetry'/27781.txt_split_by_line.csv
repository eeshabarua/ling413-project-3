31,PREFACE,PREFACE
32,PREFACE,
33,PREFACE,
34,PREFACE,The Author respectfully submits to the general public of his native town
35,PREFACE,"and district, this volume of poems, containing some of the chief results"
36,PREFACE,"of his musings for the past thirty years.  He hopes that the volume,"
37,PREFACE,"which is in reality the production of a life-time, will in many ways be"
38,PREFACE,deemed worthy of the kind and courteous approbation of his numerous
39,PREFACE,"patrons and friends, as well as the indulgence of literary critics."
40,PREFACE,
41,PREFACE,"In launching forth the work, the Author begs to tender to his patrons and"
42,PREFACE,"the public generally, his most sincere and hearty thanks for the"
43,PREFACE,assistance they have ever rendered him so as to enable him to acquire the
44,PREFACE,necessary leisure for the cultivation of his muse.  The result now
45,PREFACE,achieved is not the comprehensive collection of the efforts of the
46,PREFACE,"author, but it may he taken as a selection and a representation of his"
47,PREFACE,more generally interesting productions from time to time.
48,PREFACE,
49,PREFACE,Various reasons have operated in the time of the publication and the
50,PREFACE,curtailment of this volume; but it is now submitted with every respect to
51,PREFACE,"the public for their perusal.  Many of his poems, which are not found in"
52,PREFACE,"the present volume, the author trusts will be deemed worthy of being"
53,PREFACE,treasured in the scrap books of his friends.  Of the literary merits of
54,PREFACE,"the composition, it would ill become the author in any way to descant"
55,PREFACE,upon; but in regard to these he leaves himself entirely and absolutely in
56,PREFACE,"the hands of a critical, and, he hopes, an indulgent public, feeling"
57,PREFACE,assured that he may trust himself in the hands of his readers.
58,PREFACE,
59,PREFACE,"No formal dedication is here made to any particular patron, but the book"
60,PREFACE,is submitted without the powerful influence of any conspicuous name or
61,PREFACE,the commendation of any well-known literary friend; and like Dr. Johnson
62,PREFACE,"of old, failing patrons, he trusts that his work will, in the midst of"
63,PREFACE,"his numerous competitors, locally and generally, be thought worthy of the"
64,PREFACE,attention of the various classes of the public.

4410,(A DREAM).,
4411,(A DREAM).,"My heart was moved, for I was much astounded,"
4412,(A DREAM).,To view the many Churches of our land;
4413,(A DREAM).,The life-like pictures of the saints who founded
4414,(A DREAM).,"These ruins old, so wonderful and grand."
4415,(A DREAM).,
4416,(A DREAM).,"For oft I've wished, and often have I pondered,"
4417,(A DREAM).,And longed to learn the history of our kirk;
4418,(A DREAM).,"How it was handed down to us I've wondered,"
4419,(A DREAM).,And who were they that did this mighty work.
4420,(A DREAM).,
4421,(A DREAM).,"The veil's removed, and now my sight is clearer,"
4422,(A DREAM).,Upon the sacred history of our isle;
4423,(A DREAM).,For while I view these scenes it brings me nearer
4424,(A DREAM).,Unto the Church on which the angels smile.
4425,(A DREAM).,
4426,(A DREAM).,"Who would not shuffle off his worldly pleasures,"
4427,(A DREAM).,"For one short hour to bring before his sight,"

4456,(A DREAM).,"(Ald. ICKRINGILL), March 28th, 1891."
4457,(A DREAM).,
4458,(A DREAM).,"Come hither my muse and give me a start,"
4459,(A DREAM).,And let me give praise to the one famous art;
4460,(A DREAM).,"For it's not an M.P. or a Mayor that I toast,"
4461,(A DREAM).,"But the ancient Wool-comber, the Knight of the post."
4462,(A DREAM).,
4463,(A DREAM).,"In the brave days of old when I was a boy,"
4464,(A DREAM).,"I went to the Comb Shop, my heart full of joy;"
4465,(A DREAM).,"Where I listened to stories and legends of old,"
4466,(A DREAM).,Which to me were more precious than silver or gold.
4467,(A DREAM).,
4468,(A DREAM).,"The old Comber would tell of his travels through life,"
4469,(A DREAM).,And where he had met with his darling old wife;
4470,(A DREAM).,"And how he had stole her from her native vale,"
4471,(A DREAM).,"To help him to pull the ""old tup"" by the ""tail."""
4472,(A DREAM).,
4473,(A DREAM).,"He would go through the tales of his youthful career,"
4474,(A DREAM).,An undaunted youth without dread or fear;
4475,(A DREAM).,"He knew all the natives, the rich and the poor,"
4476,(A DREAM).,He knew every acre of mountain and moor.
4477,(A DREAM).,
4478,(A DREAM).,"He could make a sad tale of the wrongs of the State,"
4479,(A DREAM).,And tell where old England would be soon or late;
4480,(A DREAM).,"How nations would rise, and monarch's would fall,"
4481,(A DREAM).,And tyrants would tremble and go to the wall.
4482,(A DREAM).,
4483,(A DREAM).,"He was very well read, though papers were dear,"
4484,(A DREAM).,But he got _Reynold's_ newspaper year after year;
4485,(A DREAM).,"It was bound to his bosom and he read it so keen,"
4486,(A DREAM).,While at times he fair hated a King or a Queen.
4487,(A DREAM).,
4488,(A DREAM).,"He was fairly dramatic, the stage he loved well,"
4489,(A DREAM).,The names of great actors and plays he would tell;
4490,(A DREAM).,"And if that his notion it took the other way,"
4491,(A DREAM).,He could quote the Bible a night and a day.
4492,(A DREAM).,
4493,(A DREAM).,"Full of wit, full of mirth, he could give you a sting,"
4494,(A DREAM).,"He could preach, he could pray, he could dance, he could sing;"
4495,(A DREAM).,"He could play pitch and toss, he could jump, he could run,"
4496,(A DREAM).,"He could shuffle the cards, he could handle a gun."
4497,(A DREAM).,
4498,(A DREAM).,"The old Constable knew him but let him alone,"
4499,(A DREAM).,"Because he knew better than bother with ""Joan"";"
4500,(A DREAM).,For the lads of the Barracks and the Pinfold as well
4501,(A DREAM).,Would all have been there at the sound of the bell.
4502,(A DREAM).,
4503,(A DREAM).,"Old Keighley was then but a very small town,"
4504,(A DREAM).,Yet she'd twelve hundred Combers that were very well known;
4505,(A DREAM).,"Hundreds have gone over the dark flowing burn,"
4506,(A DREAM).,Whence no traveller was ever yet known to return.
4507,(A DREAM).,
4508,(A DREAM).,It reminds me again of the Donkey and pack
4509,(A DREAM).,Which came from the hills bringing Wool on its back;
4510,(A DREAM).,And if the poor beast perchance had to bray
4511,(A DREAM).,'Twere a true sign a Comber would die on that day.
4512,(A DREAM).,
4513,(A DREAM).,"The third day of the week, sometimes further on,"
4514,(A DREAM).,The old woman would seek the King's Arms for her son;
4515,(A DREAM).,"And if she were told he had not been at all,"
4516,(A DREAM).,Would bounce over the green to the Hole-in-the-Wall.
4517,(A DREAM).,
4518,(A DREAM).,"Hi! those were fine times, especially the fairs,"
4519,(A DREAM).,When the Inns were kept open for dancing upstairs;
4520,(A DREAM).,"The Commercial, Lord Rodney, as well as the Crown"
4521,(A DREAM).,To the ancient Wool-comber were fairly well known.
4522,(A DREAM).,
4523,(A DREAM).,"But now we'll get back to the pot and the pad,"
4524,(A DREAM).,"The fair it is over, the women are glad;"
4525,(A DREAM).,"For now the Wool-comber his follies he sees,"
4526,(A DREAM).,And makes resolutions as staunch as you please.
4527,(A DREAM).,
4528,(A DREAM).,"For now he commences to work hard and late,"
4529,(A DREAM).,He is building a Castle on a phantom estate;
4530,(A DREAM).,"And he toils for a time but long hoggs make him sick,"
4531,(A DREAM).,"Then he duffs, and his castle falls down, every brick."
4532,(A DREAM).,
4533,(A DREAM).,"When Winter comes in with its keen bitter blast,"
4534,(A DREAM).,And the poor rustic hind has to cope with the frost;
4535,(A DREAM).,"Yet the Comber was happy in village and town,"
4536,(A DREAM).,Though he knew that his calling was fast going down.
4537,(A DREAM).,
4538,(A DREAM).,"Oh yes, it was vanquished, the once noble art,"
4539,(A DREAM).,For science had bid it for ever depart;
4540,(A DREAM).,"Yet for thee old Comber fresh fields have arose,"
4541,(A DREAM).,"That have found thee in victuals, in fuel, and clothes."
4542,(A DREAM).,
4543,(A DREAM).,So many brave thanks to the Mayor of the town
4544,(A DREAM).,Who has made the Wool-comber once more to be known;
4545,(A DREAM).,"Let us drink to the health of our worthy host,"
4546,(A DREAM).,"The friend of the Comber, the Knight of the post."

4551,(A DREAM).,
4552,(A DREAM).,
4553,(A DREAM).,"In a little cot so dreary,"
4554,(A DREAM).,"With eyes and forehead hot and bleary,"
4555,(A DREAM).,"Sat a mother sad and weary,"
4556,(A DREAM).,With her darling on her knee;
4557,(A DREAM).,Their humble fare at best was sparing
4558,(A DREAM).,"For the father he was shearing,"
4559,(A DREAM).,"With his three brave sons of Erin,"
4560,(A DREAM).,All down in the Fen countree.
4561,(A DREAM).,
4562,(A DREAM).,"All her Saxon neighbours leave her,"
4563,(A DREAM).,"With her boy and demon fever,"
4564,(A DREAM).,"The midnight watch--none to relieve her,"
4565,(A DREAM).,Save a little Busy Bee:
4566,(A DREAM).,"He was called the Harem-Skarem,"
4567,(A DREAM).,"Noisy as a drum-clock larum,"
4568,(A DREAM).,"Yet his treasures he would share 'em,"
4569,(A DREAM).,With his friend right merrily.
4570,(A DREAM).,
4571,(A DREAM).,"Every night and every morning,"
4572,(A DREAM).,With the day sometimes at dawning--
4573,(A DREAM).,"While lay mother, sick and swooning--"
4574,(A DREAM).,To his dying mate went he:
4575,(A DREAM).,"Robbing his good Saxon mother,"
4576,(A DREAM).,"Giving to his Celtic brother,"
4577,(A DREAM).,"Who asked for him and no other,"
4578,(A DREAM).,Until his spirit it was free.
4579,(A DREAM).,
4580,(A DREAM).,Saw the shroud and saw the coffin;
4581,(A DREAM).,Brought the pipes and brought the snuff in;
4582,(A DREAM).,"This little noble-hearted ruffian,"
4583,(A DREAM).,To the wake each night went he:
4584,(A DREAM).,"Sabbath morning he was ready,"
4585,(A DREAM).,"Warn'd the bearers to be steady,"
4586,(A DREAM).,"Taking Peter to his beddy,"
4587,(A DREAM).,And a tear stood in his e'e.
4588,(A DREAM).,
4589,(A DREAM).,"Onward as the corpse was passing,"
4590,(A DREAM).,"Ere the priest gave his last blessing,"
4591,(A DREAM).,"Through the dingy crowd came pressing,"
4592,(A DREAM).,The father and the brothers three;
4593,(A DREAM).,'Tis our mother--we will greet her;
4594,(A DREAM).,How is this that here we meet her?
4595,(A DREAM).,"And without our little Peter,"
4596,(A DREAM).,Who will solve this mystery?
4597,(A DREAM).,
4598,(A DREAM).,"The Harem-Skarem interfered,"
4599,(A DREAM).,"""Soon this corpse will be interred,"
4600,(A DREAM).,"Come with us and see it buried,"
4601,(A DREAM).,"Out in yonder cemet'ry:"""
4602,(A DREAM).,Soon they knew the worst and pondered
4603,(A DREAM).,Half-amazed and half-dumbfounded;--
4604,(A DREAM).,"And returning home, they wondered"
4605,(A DREAM).,Who their little friend could be!
4606,(A DREAM).,
4607,(A DREAM).,"Turning round to him they bowed,"
4608,(A DREAM).,"Much they thanked him, much they owed;"
4609,(A DREAM).,"While the tears each cheek bedewed,"
4610,(A DREAM).,Wish'd him all prosperity:
4611,(A DREAM).,"""Never mind,"" he said, ""my brothers,"
4612,(A DREAM).,"What I've done, do ye to others;"
