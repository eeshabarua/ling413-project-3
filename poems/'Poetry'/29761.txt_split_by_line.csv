210,SANGUINE,"""The clock indicates the hour but what does enternity indicate?"""
211,SANGUINE,Whitman
212,SANGUINE,
213,SANGUINE,"Imagine, being told cubism isn't painting. That"
214,SANGUINE,"Beardsley didn't die at 26, unheralded as a boy genius"
215,SANGUINE,or Corot didn't come to Paris after all.
216,SANGUINE,
217,SANGUINE,"Imagine, The Louvre without a rooftop, the"
218,SANGUINE,intelligentsia sitting down to a ragged table
219,SANGUINE,"surrounded by sawdust intellects, Proust not being"
220,SANGUINE,able to write his name.
221,SANGUINE,
222,SANGUINE,"Now that's splendour -- that's in-depth ""feeling""."
223,SANGUINE,That's emotion to pull your socks or catch the bus on
224,SANGUINE,a brittle day.
225,SANGUINE,
226,SANGUINE,"It's easy. Try to ""feel"" the event. It's 1896. People are"
227,SANGUINE,perturbed (or so we are told) because the century's
228,SANGUINE,getting old. Time's rushing by. There's an alarm clock
229,SANGUINE,"set to buzz at eternity's gate, Midnight 1900."
230,SANGUINE,
231,SANGUINE,"In probing the malaise that hit Europe circa 1881,"
232,SANGUINE,psychologists would have us believe the world grew
233,SANGUINE,despondent. Despondent because a whole hundred
234,SANGUINE,year cycle was about to elapse; despondent because
235,SANGUINE,life itself was running out. Those poor Edwardians!
236,SANGUINE,"Poor lovers of the elegant, the late Victorians, belle"
237,SANGUINE,epoquers. A penny for their thoughts when
238,SANGUINE,confronting a Picasso without the vantage of
239,SANGUINE,hindsight.
240,SANGUINE,
241,SANGUINE,Page 12
242,SANGUINE,"If Europe and its child bride, America, grew uneasy in"
243,SANGUINE,the declining years of the past century. How then our
244,SANGUINE,era? (These same psychologists pinpoint people's
245,SANGUINE,spirits rise in the opening years of a new century.)
246,SANGUINE,"Now we're poised for the ""really big one"": the"
247,SANGUINE,cataclysm. What a boon for the absurdists. Peaches
248,SANGUINE,and cream -- not just one century dangling but the
249,SANGUINE,culmination of ten.
250,SANGUINE,
251,SANGUINE,"There's even a word for it. Millenium, I'll say it again."
252,SANGUINE,"Better yet, a mere two millenia since Christ's"
253,SANGUINE,"departure, we are poised again on the threshold. Half"
254,SANGUINE,"& half. Like a party twelve pack -- six of one, half"
255,SANGUINE,dozen of the other.
256,SANGUINE,
257,SANGUINE,Remember. when contemplating your ennui or
258,SANGUINE,malaise (whichever word is currently most
259,SANGUINE,"fashionable), you can hardly figure for less. Eternity's"
260,SANGUINE,"given to you, my peers, a singular opportunity. And"
261,SANGUINE,from what we know of the 20th century. it should be a
262,SANGUINE,grand slam homer. Already the clean-up batter is
263,SANGUINE,staged for action. The bat looms over the plate.
264,SANGUINE,There's so much bad news it's enough to make an
265,SANGUINE,"optimist greedy. After all, with this much horror there"
266,SANGUINE,is caused only for danse macabre celebrations.
267,SANGUINE,
268,SANGUINE,1985. Only 15 years left before the digital watch rolls
269,SANGUINE,over. before the cannon with the flower pops out.
270,SANGUINE,
271,SANGUINE,Those forward looking voyeurs of hundred years
272,SANGUINE,back must have felt cheated when mentally reversing
273,SANGUINE,their lot with the denizens of the 20th century.
274,SANGUINE,
275,SANGUINE,Page 13
276,SANGUINE,"In 1885, you could only gripe about the aging process"
277,SANGUINE,"of a single tenth of one component. In 1985, you've got"
278,SANGUINE,that and the Millenia. Trendy things like atmospheric
279,SANGUINE,"pressure, negetive ions, adverse body rhythms and a"
280,SANGUINE,welter of other pseudo impressive formula abound to
281,SANGUINE,help out in your witchhunt.
282,SANGUINE,
283,SANGUINE,"Surprise. 1066 saw comets, omens. signs coded in"
284,SANGUINE,stars speeding ecross the sky -- a host of ditlurbing.
285,SANGUINE,natural phenomena to boot. The vigilant saw meteors
286,SANGUINE,"at Caesar's, death."
287,SANGUINE,
288,SANGUINE,The National Enquirer predicts Australia will break
289,SANGUINE,into the sea. Californians will be upstaged. The
290,SANGUINE,futurists will all need waterwings. The Club of Rome
291,SANGUINE,hints the next years auger more chilling holocausts.
292,SANGUINE,
293,SANGUINE,"Everywhere, survival scenarios proliferate. Pro-lifers"
294,SANGUINE,will rearrange proverbial deck chairs on the
295,SANGUINE,Titanic. Soothsayers will become all the rage as we
296,SANGUINE,"plot myriad escapes. A year's supply of canned goods,"
297,SANGUINE,anyone?
298,SANGUINE,
299,SANGUINE,"1885 has a lot to teach us. Umbrellas, a gentle ennui"
300,SANGUINE,like fine mist compounded by traffic in & out of the
301,SANGUINE,Moulin Rouge. Perhaps a surfeit of absinthe helps just
302,SANGUINE,"as its equivalent does today. ""Cheer up, there will"
303,SANGUINE,"always be an England"" doesn't sound so bad after all."
304,SANGUINE,
305,SANGUINE,"And there's always that one recruiting poster, ""What"
306,SANGUINE,"did you do in the Great War, daddy""?"

325,THE EAST IS RED,THE EAST IS RED
326,THE EAST IS RED,
327,THE EAST IS RED,"We can survive a nuclear War. It's scarcely credible, I"
328,THE EAST IS RED,"know, but listen."
329,THE EAST IS RED,
330,THE EAST IS RED,The human race has great resilience. We've come back
331,THE EAST IS RED,"before --  all those plagues, the Black Death,"
332,THE EAST IS RED,"despoliations, scorched earth policies ""prove"" it."
333,THE EAST IS RED,We're proliferate and we love the sex act. It won't be
334,THE EAST IS RED,hard; human fecundity is a count-on. There are so
335,THE EAST IS RED,"many of us, see."
336,THE EAST IS RED,
337,THE EAST IS RED,People have overestimated the alleged horror. After
338,THE EAST IS RED,"all, (Khruschev pounding a UN table with his shoes)."
339,THE EAST IS RED,somebody walked away from firebombing at Dresden.
340,THE EAST IS RED,Look at at all the escapees in Hiroshima. Get the drift?
341,THE EAST IS RED,
342,THE EAST IS RED,A Bomb's a Bomb. Really. The really big one (to take
343,THE EAST IS RED,Ed Sullivan'a phrase out of context) is just more of the
344,THE EAST IS RED,"same. Try to absorb that logic. Ergo, Ignorance must"
345,THE EAST IS RED,"be, in toto strength."
346,THE EAST IS RED,
347,THE EAST IS RED,Enraged by the impropriety of it all? Anyone who
348,THE EAST IS RED,disagrees with this is coarse and vulgar.
349,THE EAST IS RED,
350,THE EAST IS RED,"Of course there would have to be ""preparations"". (If"
351,THE EAST IS RED,"you have ""to prepare"" to be a hairdresser, it stands to"
352,THE EAST IS RED,reason you would have to ready yourself for this.)
353,THE EAST IS RED,
354,THE EAST IS RED,"Confronting, facts you can die only once. After that,"
355,THE EAST IS RED,the mushroom cloud is anticlimactic. Remember the
356,THE EAST IS RED,Magic Mushroom -- the cult that centred its teachings
357,THE EAST IS RED,around Christianlty's debt to hallucegenic drugs?
358,THE EAST IS RED,Some said preposterous -- Christ a magician doping
359,THE EAST IS RED,his followers and using the Cross as a stage prop.
360,THE EAST IS RED,Amazing. In this world anything is possible. We have
361,THE EAST IS RED,finally created a mutant of people who eccept
362,THE EAST IS RED,"anything. And God just another man, albeit a tricky"
363,THE EAST IS RED,"devil at that. Imagine fooling everyone for 2,000"
364,THE EAST IS RED,years!
365,THE EAST IS RED,
366,THE EAST IS RED,"Next, we'll be told we're actually dead. I know some of"
367,THE EAST IS RED,you have already suspected this but it will be
368,THE EAST IS RED,
369,THE EAST IS RED,Page 16
370,THE EAST IS RED,"""confirmed"". Our leaders will troopse out impressive"
371,THE EAST IS RED,"sounding ""flow charts"" and backup statistics. There"
372,THE EAST IS RED,will even be a special chamber to experience what it
373,THE EAST IS RED,was like before you knew you were dead with
374,THE EAST IS RED,"carefully monitored ""response signals"" to give the"
375,THE EAST IS RED,"audience a ""sensasound"" aura just like living through"
376,THE EAST IS RED,"an earthquake, only fake. Just remember Monty"
377,THE EAST IS RED,"Python and ""possibility""."
378,THE EAST IS RED,
379,THE EAST IS RED,"Meanwhile, in ensuing preparations for war, no"
380,THE EAST IS RED,aspect of the psychological preparedness should be
381,THE EAST IS RED,overlooked. We don't have to be told there is no
382,THE EAST IS RED,substitute for victory.
383,THE EAST IS RED,
384,THE EAST IS RED,"""The play's the thing wherein I'll catch the conscience"
385,THE EAST IS RED,"of a King."" Hamlet knew. So does The Kremlin. The"
386,THE EAST IS RED,"KGB can ""prove"" a nuclear scenario is winnable."
387,THE EAST IS RED,"According to the most painstaking calculations, a"
388,THE EAST IS RED,"conventional war of any duration ""swings"" into a pre-nuclear"
389,THE EAST IS RED,stage. That's when the nuclear option
390,THE EAST IS RED,"becomes ""viable"". That's when Gorbachev and the"
391,THE EAST IS RED,"boys calculate ""target readiness"" and plummet the"
392,THE EAST IS RED,depths of the human spirit.
393,THE EAST IS RED,
394,THE EAST IS RED,The East is Red and ready. The Chinese have been told
395,THE EAST IS RED,by Mao 300 million or their number cremated is a
396,THE EAST IS RED,small price for global supremacy. A human dung hill
397,THE EAST IS RED,is being set in motion for another generation of
398,THE EAST IS RED,"poppies. Marx lends credibility to this, but with a"
399,THE EAST IS RED,different opiate for the masses. The
400,THE EAST IS RED,lumpenproletariat can hack it. Such clever playing
401,THE EAST IS RED,"with facts, now I understand genius."
402,THE EAST IS RED,
403,THE EAST IS RED,"For a young physicist, a 100 megaton blast is the"
404,THE EAST IS RED,culmination of the creative spirit. Certainly
405,THE EAST IS RED,"irrefutable evidence, this quintessential ""spirit""."
406,THE EAST IS RED,
407,THE EAST IS RED,"I read Toronto would be ""messy"" in the event of a"
408,THE EAST IS RED,nuclear strike. Half-baked and eviscerated thinking
409,THE EAST IS RED,Or just inescaspable?
410,THE EAST IS RED,
411,THE EAST IS RED,Chin up. We'll survive or at least part of us will. We
412,THE EAST IS RED,"really are ""malleable"". It will be a ""transitional stage"","
413,THE EAST IS RED,
414,THE EAST IS RED,Page17
415,THE EAST IS RED,a step upwards on the evolutionary ladder.
416,THE EAST IS RED,Radioactivity and genetics are at work with one
417,THE EAST IS RED,another.
418,THE EAST IS RED,
419,THE EAST IS RED,"When the Enola Gay dropped the first atomic device,"
420,THE EAST IS RED,the pilot was later to go mad.
421,THE EAST IS RED,
422,THE EAST IS RED,Maybe this has already happened to the world and
423,THE EAST IS RED,there's no one to discern the difference.
424,THE EAST IS RED,
425,THE EAST IS RED,"Maybe a forest of ""maybes"" has already sprouted and"
426,THE EAST IS RED,left a forest of dust clouding the collective vision.
427,THE EAST IS RED,
428,THE EAST IS RED,Maybe it's all too terrifying to be taken seriously and
429,THE EAST IS RED,disbelief is the escape hatch. Like the pilot's lapse into
430,THE EAST IS RED,comforting drugs for reassurance or the dervishes
431,THE EAST IS RED,with their Magic Mushroom.
432,THE EAST IS RED,
433,THE EAST IS RED,Maybe it's closer to what Harry Truman announced
434,THE EAST IS RED,"after ""deploying"" the first ""device"" or exercising the"
435,THE EAST IS RED,nuclear option in the jargon of the strategists.
436,THE EAST IS RED,
437,THE EAST IS RED,They started it. We prepared to end it. No regrets.

2254,DRESS REHEARSAL,from our collective vision? Sobering stuff.
2255,DRESS REHEARSAL,"Meanwhile, on a spaceship earth preparations are"
2256,DRESS REHEARSAL,underway. Preparation to abandon the planet.
2257,DRESS REHEARSAL,Preparations to forget life is a serious matter.
2258,DRESS REHEARSAL,Preparations to drown protracted speculations about
2259,DRESS REHEARSAL,existence's intensity.
2260,DRESS REHEARSAL,"E.T. mania is carrying the day. People adorn stuffed,"
2261,DRESS REHEARSAL,life-sized dolls of imagined creatures on the
2262,DRESS REHEARSAL,dashboards of their cars. Children queque up for
2263,DRESS REHEARSAL,"hours to get gingerbread designed from scary,"
2264,DRESS REHEARSAL,"monster dough. Everywhere, the question on"
2265,DRESS REHEARSAL,"everyone's lips is ""how many of'em are there""?"
2266,DRESS REHEARSAL,When will contact be made? Will they want to throw
2267,DRESS REHEARSAL,"in their lot with mankind or ""take over""? After all, it's"
2268,DRESS REHEARSAL,our Arc. No one seriously wants reminders of Von
2269,DRESS REHEARSAL,Daniken's chariots riding again or the genetic mumble
2270,DRESS REHEARSAL,about intergalactic breeding.
2271,DRESS REHEARSAL,Going to bed with E.T. is too much. It's the Outer
2272,DRESS REHEARSAL,Limits. Propriety still has some hold even if Marian
2273,DRESS REHEARSAL,Engel did slip up and get it on with a bear. At least
2274,DRESS REHEARSAL,
2275,DRESS REHEARSAL,Page 83
2276,DRESS REHEARSAL,that was recognizable earth life. Darth is too much of
2277,DRESS REHEARSAL,a transition even if it's only a One Night Stand.
2278,DRESS REHEARSAL,
2279,DRESS REHEARSAL,E.T. is just like Bambi.
2280,DRESS REHEARSAL,He wants to go home.
2281,DRESS REHEARSAL,And alone.
2282,DRESS REHEARSAL,He's not interested in sex.
2283,DRESS REHEARSAL,Too many other myriad problems are floating in his
2284,DRESS REHEARSAL,"adorable, gelatin head. Surely earth women can relate"
2285,DRESS REHEARSAL,"to that. Surely, if the universe is expanding, then it's"
2286,DRESS REHEARSAL,because of intrigue in high places. Because cosmic
2287,DRESS REHEARSAL,particles are hammering out new definitions. Anyone
2288,DRESS REHEARSAL,of a thousand theories.
2289,DRESS REHEARSAL,"Star Wars can stuff it. We want ""peaceful"" contact"
2290,DRESS REHEARSAL,and on our terms. Ask Orson Welles.
2291,DRESS REHEARSAL,Or H.G.Wells.
2292,DRESS REHEARSAL,Time machines are old hat and another invasion in
2293,DRESS REHEARSAL,Newark is too much to absorb.
2294,DRESS REHEARSAL,"With NYC across the river, they've already got all the"
2295,DRESS REHEARSAL,action they can handle.
2296,DRESS REHEARSAL,We like our extraterrestial life tailormade and
2297,DRESS REHEARSAL,preferably in our own image. We're prepared to accept
2298,DRESS REHEARSAL,them if they conform to stiff criteria. They have to be
2299,DRESS REHEARSAL,like us and prepared to cooperate. Seeing eye dogs
2300,DRESS REHEARSAL,"help the blind, horses were good draft animals for"
2301,DRESS REHEARSAL,centuries. We might even want to decorate it like the
2302,DRESS REHEARSAL,"Hindoos do elephants; make it into a ""religious"""
2303,DRESS REHEARSAL,procession such as a Roman Triumph. It would be the
2304,DRESS REHEARSAL,same for outer space visitors. No mutants or Roving
2305,DRESS REHEARSAL,"Intelligences allowed. Earth is ""off limits"" to"
2306,DRESS REHEARSAL,marauding predators -- we'll fight at the suggestion
2307,DRESS REHEARSAL,"they're here on ""reconnoitering missions"" as a prelude"
2308,DRESS REHEARSAL,to Conquest or the Bermuda Triangle is one of their
2309,DRESS REHEARSAL,"many ""staging areas"" or dress rehearsal sites."

2316,DRESS REHEARSAL,Hollywood's got it all figured out.
2317,DRESS REHEARSAL,There's no shortage or scenarios.
2318,DRESS REHEARSAL,Life support systems will be rushed wherever there is
2319,DRESS REHEARSAL,a sighting with artillery back-up.
2320,DRESS REHEARSAL,The Pentagon is in control.
2321,DRESS REHEARSAL,The Moonies have asked to be informed.
2322,DRESS REHEARSAL,Crackpots the world over await deliverance.
2323,DRESS REHEARSAL,The Earth has big plans for the visitation.
2324,DRESS REHEARSAL,Contact would displace Ihe Copernician revolution as
2325,DRESS REHEARSAL,"""a first"" in blockbuster events: edge out Columbus'"
2326,DRESS REHEARSAL,"hat trick, even erase Caesar's Gaelic campaigns."
2327,DRESS REHEARSAL,"Such things are no longer ""relatable""."
2328,DRESS REHEARSAL,"Every school kid can fathom ""aliens"" even if he can't"
2329,DRESS REHEARSAL,decline a Latin noun or understand the causes of the
2330,DRESS REHEARSAL,Renaissance.
2331,DRESS REHEARSAL,Unveiling the first spaceship would cap the
2332,DRESS REHEARSAL,evolutionary quest for Enlightenment or realization of
2333,DRESS REHEARSAL,a greater Oneness.
2334,DRESS REHEARSAL,The universal thirst for knowledge would be satisfied.
2335,DRESS REHEARSAL,"Still, our trek to the stars would turn in on itself if they"
2336,DRESS REHEARSAL,got here first. Something like the Seminoles arriving
2337,DRESS REHEARSAL,in Paris in the 13th century overland from Nice or
2338,DRESS REHEARSAL,"finding an orangutan piloted the Viking ship, Sutton"
2339,DRESS REHEARSAL,"Hoo, into Vineland. It's barely credible and has to be"
2340,DRESS REHEARSAL,"remade into ""tangible"" dialogue. No sapient, red"
2341,DRESS REHEARSAL,puddles or Dryads need apply. Fuel up the
2342,DRESS REHEARSAL,Crematoria. Break out the electric cattle prods. They
2343,DRESS REHEARSAL,may be common as blades of grass in a meadow but it's
2344,DRESS REHEARSAL,our show. Orange Pekoe intellects will naturally be
2345,DRESS REHEARSAL,suspect. Benign intelligence better be the order of the
2346,DRESS REHEARSAL,day.
2347,DRESS REHEARSAL,"Earth is a ""closed shop""."
2348,DRESS REHEARSAL,Everything Koltur. Everything above board.
2349,DRESS REHEARSAL,"No renegade ""interpretations""."
