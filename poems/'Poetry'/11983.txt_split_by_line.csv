203,TO THE REVIEWERS.,
204,TO THE REVIEWERS.,
205,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Oh, ye! enthron'd in presidential awe,"
206,TO THE REVIEWERS.,To give the song-smit generation law;
207,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Who wield Apollo's delegated rod,"
208,TO THE REVIEWERS.,And shake Parnassus with your sovereign nod;
209,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"A pensive Pilgrim, worn with base turmoils,"
210,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Plebian cares, and mercenary toils,"
211,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Implores your pity, while with footsteps rude,"
212,TO THE REVIEWERS.,He dares within the mountain's pale intrude;
213,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"For, oh! enchantment through its empire dwells,"
214,TO THE REVIEWERS.,And rules the spirit with Lethëan spells;
215,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"By hands unseen aërial harps are hung,"
216,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"And Spring, like Hebe, ever fair and young,"
217,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"On her broad bosom rears the laughing loves,"
218,TO THE REVIEWERS.,And breathes bland incense through the warbling groves;
219,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Spontaneous, bids unfading blossoms blow."
220,TO THE REVIEWERS.,And nectar'd streams mellifluously flow.
221,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"There, while the Muses, wanton, unconfin'd,"
222,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"And wreaths resplendent round their temples bind,"
223,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"'Tis yours, to strew their steps with votive flowers;"
224,TO THE REVIEWERS.,To watch them slumbering midst the blissful bowers;
225,TO THE REVIEWERS.,To guard the shades that hide their sacred charms;
226,TO THE REVIEWERS.,And shield their beauties from unhallow'd arms!
227,TO THE REVIEWERS.,Oh! may their suppliant steal a passing kiss?
228,TO THE REVIEWERS.,Alas! he pants not for superior bliss;
229,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Thrice-bless'd, his virgin modesty shall be"
230,TO THE REVIEWERS.,To snatch an evanescent ecstacy!
231,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"The fierce extremes of superhuman love,"
232,TO THE REVIEWERS.,For his frail sense too exquisite might prove;
233,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"He turns, all blushing, from th'Aönian shade"
234,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"To humbler raptures, with a mortal maid."
235,TO THE REVIEWERS.,
236,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"I know 'tis yours, when unscholastic wights"
237,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Unloose their fancies in presumptuous flights,"
238,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Awak'd to vengeance, on such flights to frown."
239,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Clip the wing'd horse, and roll his rider down."
240,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"But, if empower'd to strike th'immortal lyre."
241,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"The ardent vot'ry glows with genuine fire,"
242,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"'Tis yours, while care recoils, and envy flies"
243,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Subdued by his resistless energies,"
244,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"'Tis yours to bid Piërian fountains flow,"
245,TO THE REVIEWERS.,And toast his name in Wit's seraglio;
246,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"To bind his brows with amaranthine bays,"
247,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"And bless, with beef and beer, his mundane days!"
248,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Alas! nor beef, nor beer, nor bays are mine,"
249,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"If by your looks, my doom I may divine,"
250,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Ye frown so dreadful, and ye swell so big"
251,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Your fateful arms, the goosequill and the wig:"
252,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"The wig, with wisdom's somb'rous seal impress'd,"
253,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Mysterious terrors, grim portents, invest;"
254,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"And shame and honor on the goosequill perch,"
255,TO THE REVIEWERS.,Like doves and ravens on a country church.
256,TO THE REVIEWERS.,
257,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"As some raw 'Squire, by rustic nymphs admir'd,"
258,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Of vulgar charms, and easy conquests tir'd,"
259,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Resolves new scenes and nobler flights to dare,"
260,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Nor ""waste his sweetness in the desert air"","
261,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"To town repairs, some fam'd assembly seeks,"
262,TO THE REVIEWERS.,With red importance blust'ring in his cheeks;
263,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"But when, electric on th'astonish'd wight"
264,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Burst the full floods of music and of light,"
265,TO THE REVIEWERS.,While levell'd mirrors multiply the rows
266,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Of radiant beauties, and accomplish'd beaus,"
267,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"At once confounded into sober sense,"
268,TO THE REVIEWERS.,He feels his pristine insignificance;
269,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"And blinking, blund'ring, from the general _quiz_"
270,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Retreats, ""to ponder on the thing he is."""
271,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"By pride inflated, and by praise allur'd,"
272,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Small Authors thus strut forth, and thus get cur'd;"
273,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"But, Critics, hear! an angel pleads for _me_,"
274,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"That tongueless, ten-tongued cherub, _Modesty_."
275,TO THE REVIEWERS.,
276,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Sirs! if you damn me, you'll resemble those"
277,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"That flay'd the Travell'r, who had lost his clothes;"
278,TO THE REVIEWERS.,Are there not foes enough to _do_ my books?
279,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Relentless trunk-makers, and pastry-cooks?"
280,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Acknowledge not those barbarous allies,"
281,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"The wooden box-men, and the men of pies:"
282,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"For heav'n's sake, let it ne'er be understood"
283,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"That you, great Censors! coalesce with _wood_;"
284,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Nor let your actions contradict your looks,"
285,TO THE REVIEWERS.,That tell the world you ne'er colleague with _cooks_.
286,TO THE REVIEWERS.,
287,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"But, if the blithe muse will indulge a smile,"
288,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Why scowls thy brow, O Bookseller! the while?"
289,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Thy sunk eyes glisten through eclipsing fears,"
290,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Fill'd, like Cassandra's, with prophetic tears:"
291,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"With such a visage, withering, woe-begone,"
292,TO THE REVIEWERS.,Shrinks the pale poet from the damning dun.
293,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Come, let us teach each others tears to flow,"
294,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Like fasting bards, in fellowship of woe,"
295,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"When the coy muse puts on coquettish airs,"
296,TO THE REVIEWERS.,Nor deigns one line to their voracious prayers;
297,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Thy spirit, groaning like th'encumber'd block"
298,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Which bears my works, deplores them as _dead stock_,"
299,TO THE REVIEWERS.,Doom'd by these undiscriminating times
300,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"To endless sleep, with Della Cruscan rhymes;"
301,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Yes, Critics, whisper thee, litigious wretches!"
302,TO THE REVIEWERS.,Oblivion's hand shall _finish_ all my _Sketches_.
303,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"But see, _my_ soul such bug-bears has repell'd"
304,TO THE REVIEWERS.,With magnanimity unparallel'd!
305,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Take up the volumes, every care dismiss,"
306,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"And smile, gruff Gorgon! while I tell thee this:"
307,TO THE REVIEWERS.,"Not one shall lie neglected on the shelf,"
308,TO THE REVIEWERS.,All shall be sold--I'll buy them in myself.
