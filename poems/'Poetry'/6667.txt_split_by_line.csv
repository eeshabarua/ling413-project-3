156,THE QUEEN’S LAST RIDE,
157,THE QUEEN’S LAST RIDE,"The Queen is taking a drive to-day,"
158,THE QUEEN’S LAST RIDE,"They have hung with purple the carriage-way,"
159,THE QUEEN’S LAST RIDE,They have dressed with purple the royal track
160,THE QUEEN’S LAST RIDE,Where the Queen goes forth and never comes back.
161,THE QUEEN’S LAST RIDE,
162,THE QUEEN’S LAST RIDE,Let no man labour as she goes by
163,THE QUEEN’S LAST RIDE,On her last appearance to mortal eye:
164,THE QUEEN’S LAST RIDE,With heads uncovered let all men wait
165,THE QUEEN’S LAST RIDE,"For the Queen to pass, in her regal state."
166,THE QUEEN’S LAST RIDE,
167,THE QUEEN’S LAST RIDE,Army and Navy shall lead the way

172,THE QUEEN’S LAST RIDE,"Shall the Flags of all Nations be half-mast-furled,"
173,THE QUEEN’S LAST RIDE,For the silent lady of royal birth
174,THE QUEEN’S LAST RIDE,"Who is riding away from the Courts of earth,"
175,THE QUEEN’S LAST RIDE,Riding away from the world’s unrest
176,THE QUEEN’S LAST RIDE,"To a mystical goal, on a secret quest."

196,THE MEETING OF THE CENTURIES,"Two Centuries meet, and sit down vis-à-vis"
197,THE MEETING OF THE CENTURIES,Across the great round table of the world:
198,THE MEETING OF THE CENTURIES,"One with suggested sorrows in his mien,"
199,THE MEETING OF THE CENTURIES,And on his brow the furrowed lines of thought;
200,THE MEETING OF THE CENTURIES,And one whose glad expectant presence brought
201,THE MEETING OF THE CENTURIES,A glow and radiance from the realms unseen.
202,THE MEETING OF THE CENTURIES,
203,THE MEETING OF THE CENTURIES,"Hand clasped with hand, in silence for a space"
204,THE MEETING OF THE CENTURIES,The Centuries sat; the sad old eyes of one
205,THE MEETING OF THE CENTURIES,(As grave paternal eyes regard a son)
206,THE MEETING OF THE CENTURIES,Gazing upon that other eager face.
207,THE MEETING OF THE CENTURIES,"And then a voice, as cadenceless and gray"
208,THE MEETING OF THE CENTURIES,"As the sea’s monody in winter time,"
209,THE MEETING OF THE CENTURIES,"Mingled with tones melodious, as the chime"

217,THE OLD CENTURY SPEAKS,"For all the dreams that look forth from your eyes,"
218,THE OLD CENTURY SPEAKS,"And those bright-hued ambitions, which I know"
219,THE OLD CENTURY SPEAKS,"Must fall like leaves and perish, in Time’s snow,"
220,THE OLD CENTURY SPEAKS,"(Even as my soul’s garden stands bereft,)"
221,THE OLD CENTURY SPEAKS,I give you pity! ’tis the one gift left.

225,THE NEW CENTURY,"Nay, nay, good friend! not pity, but Godspeed,"
226,THE NEW CENTURY,Here in the morning of my life I need.
227,THE NEW CENTURY,"Counsel, and not condolence; smiles, not tears,"
228,THE NEW CENTURY,To guide me through the channels of the years.
229,THE NEW CENTURY,"Oh, I am blinded by the blaze of light"
230,THE NEW CENTURY,That shines upon me from the Infinite.

239,THE OLD CENTURY,"For pilot, lo! the pirate age in speed"
240,THE OLD CENTURY,Bears on to ruin.  War’s most hideous crimes
241,THE OLD CENTURY,Besmirch the record of these modern times.

247,THE NEW CENTURY,You speak as one too weary to be just.
248,THE NEW CENTURY,I hear the guns—I see the greed and lust.
249,THE NEW CENTURY,The death throes of a giant evil fill
250,THE NEW CENTURY,The air with riot and confusion.  Ill
251,THE NEW CENTURY,Ofttimes makes fallow ground for Good; and Wrong
252,THE NEW CENTURY,"Builds Right’s foundation, when it grows too strong."
253,THE NEW CENTURY,"Pregnant with promise is the hour, and grand"

261,THE OLD CENTURY,"Alas, that my poor foolish age outran"
262,THE OLD CENTURY,Its early trust in God!  The death of art
263,THE OLD CENTURY,"And progress follows, when the world’s hard heart"
264,THE OLD CENTURY,Casts out religion.  ’Tis the human brain
265,THE OLD CENTURY,"Men worship now, and heaven, to them, means—gain."
266,THE OLD CENTURY,
267,THE NEW CENTURY,THE NEW CENTURY
268,THE NEW CENTURY,
269,THE NEW CENTURY,"Faith is not dead, tho’ priest and creed may pass,"
270,THE NEW CENTURY,"For thought has leavened the whole unthinking mass,"
271,THE NEW CENTURY,And man looks now to find the God within.
272,THE NEW CENTURY,"We shall talk more of love, and less of sin,"
273,THE NEW CENTURY,In this new era.  We are drawing near
274,THE NEW CENTURY,Unatlassed boundaries of a larger sphere.
275,THE NEW CENTURY,"With awe, I wait, till Science leads us on,"
276,THE NEW CENTURY,Into the full effulgence of its dawn.

351,GRIEF,With her widow’s grief fresh upon her.
352,GRIEF,
353,GRIEF,He had shed the glory of Love and Fame
354,GRIEF,In a golden halo about her;

365,GRIEF,That I knew was right and becoming
366,GRIEF,Only a thought as the mourning train

804,THE FIRE BRIGADE,
805,THE FIRE BRIGADE,There’s a fire in the city! the engines are coming!
806,THE FIRE BRIGADE,"The bold bells are clanging, “Make way in the street!”"

2934,MY SHIPS,"And all the others came to me,"
2935,MY SHIPS,"Weighed down with gems and wealth untold,"
2936,MY SHIPS,"With glory, honours, riches, gold,"
2937,MY SHIPS,The poorest soul on earth I’d be
2938,MY SHIPS,If that one ship came not to me.

2941,MY SHIPS,Blow all my ships safe home to me!
2942,MY SHIPS,"But if thou sendest some a-wrack,"
2943,MY SHIPS,"To never more come sailing back,"
2944,MY SHIPS,"Send any—all that skim the sea,"
