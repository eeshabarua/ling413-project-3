                     II

So long, so far, Jehovah guides
  His people's path attending,
By pastures green and water-sides
  Toward His hill ascending;
      Whence they beneath the stars
      Shall view their ancient wars,
      Their perils, far removed.
      O might of mercy proved!
        O love past comprehending!
