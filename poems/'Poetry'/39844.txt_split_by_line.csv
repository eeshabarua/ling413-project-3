229,II.,"And virgin forest, verdant plain,"
230,II.,"The briny sea, the balmy air,"
231,II.,"Each blade of grass and globe of rain,"
232,II.,And glimmering cave and gloomy lair
233,II.,"Began to swarm with beasts and birds,"
234,II.,With floating fish and fleet-foot herds.
235,II.,
236,II.,The lust of life's delirious fires
237,II.,"Burned like a fever in their blood,"
238,II.,"Now pricked them on with fierce desires,"
239,II.,"Now drove them famishing for food,"
240,II.,"To seize coy females in the fray,"
241,II.,Or hotly hunted hunt for prey.
242,II.,
243,II.,And amorously urged them on
244,II.,"In wood or wild to court their mate,"
245,II.,Proudly displaying in the sun
246,II.,"With antics strange and looks elate,"
247,II.,The vigour of their mighty thews
248,II.,Or charm of million-coloured hues.
249,II.,
250,II.,"There crouching 'mid the scarlet bloom,"
251,II.,"Voluptuously the leopard lies,"
252,II.,And through the tropic forest gloom
253,II.,The flaming of his feline eyes
254,II.,Stirs with intoxicating stress
255,II.,The pulses of the leopardess.
256,II.,
257,II.,Or two swart bulls of self-same age
258,II.,"Meet furiously with thunderous roar,"
259,II.,"And lash together, blind with rage,"
260,II.,And clanging horns that fain would gore
261,II.,"Their rival, and so win the prize"
262,II.,Of those impassive female eyes.
263,II.,
264,II.,"Or in the nuptial days of spring,"
265,II.,"When April kindles bush and brier,"
266,II.,"Like rainbows that have taken wing,"
267,II.,"Or palpitating gems of fire,"
268,II.,Bright butterflies in one brief day
269,II.,Live but to love and pass away.
270,II.,
271,II.,"And herds of horses scour the plains,"
272,II.,The thickets scream with bird and beast
273,II.,"The love of life burns in their veins,"
274,II.,And from the mightiest to the least
275,II.,Each preys upon the other's life
276,II.,In inextinguishable strife.
277,II.,
278,II.,War rages on the teeming earth;
279,II.,The hot and sanguinary fight
280,II.,Begins with each new creature's birth:
281,II.,A dreadful war where might is right;
282,II.,"Where still the strongest slay and win,"
283,II.,Where weakness is the only sin.
284,II.,
285,II.,"There is no truce to this drawn battle,"
286,II.,Which ends but to begin again;
287,II.,"The drip of blood, the hoarse death-rattle,"
288,II.,"The roar of rage, the shriek of pain,"
289,II.,"Are rife in fairest grove and dell,"
290,II.,Turning earth's flowery haunts to hell.
291,II.,
292,II.,"A hell of hunger, hatred, lust,"
293,II.,"Which goads all creatures here below,"
294,II.,"Or blindworm wriggling in the dust,"
295,II.,Or penguin in the Polar snow:
296,II.,"A hell where there is none to save,"
297,II.,Where life is life's insatiate grave.
298,II.,
299,II.,"And in the long portentous strife,"
300,II.,"Where types are tried even as by fire,"
301,II.,Where life is whetted upon life
302,II.,"And step by panting step mounts higher,"
303,II.,Apes lifting hairy arms now stand
304,II.,And free the wonder-working hand.
305,II.,
306,II.,"They raise a light, aërial house"
307,II.,"On shafts of widely branching trees,"
308,II.,"Where, harboured warily, each spouse"
309,II.,"May feed her little ape in peace,"
310,II.,"Green cradled in his heaven-roofed bed,"
311,II.,Leaves rustling lullabies o'erhead.
312,II.,
313,II.,"And lo, 'mid reeking swarms of earth"
314,II.,"Grim struggling in the primal wood,"
315,II.,A new strange creature hath its birth:
316,II.,Wild--stammering--nameless--shameless--nude;
317,II.,"Spurred on by want, held in by fear,"
318,II.,He hides his head in caverns drear.
319,II.,
320,II.,"Most unprotected of earth's kin,"
321,II.,His fight for life that seems so vain
322,II.,"Sharpens his senses, till within"
323,II.,"The twilight mazes of his brain,"
324,II.,"Like embryos within the womb,"
325,II.,Thought pushes feelers through the gloom.
326,II.,
327,II.,And slowly in the fateful race
328,II.,"It grows unconscious, till at length"
329,II.,The helpless savage dares to face
330,II.,The cave-bear in his grisly strength;
331,II.,For stronger than its bulky thews
332,II.,He feels a force that grows with use.
333,II.,
334,II.,"From age to dumb unnumbered age,"
335,II.,"By dim gradations long and slow,"
336,II.,"He reaches on from stage to stage,"
337,II.,"Through fear and famine, weal and woe"
338,II.,"And, compassed round with danger, still"
339,II.,Prolongs his life by craft and skill.
340,II.,
341,II.,"With cunning hand he shapes the flint,"
342,II.,"He carves the horn with strange device,"
343,II.,He splits the rebel block by dint
344,II.,Of effort--till one day there flies
345,II.,A spark of fire from out the stone:
346,II.,Fire which shall make the world his own.
347,II.,
348,III.,III.
349,III.,
350,III.,And from the clash of warring Nature's strife
351,III.,Man day by day wins his imperilled life;
352,III.,"For, goaded on by want, he hunts the roe,"
353,III.,"Chases the deer, and lays the wild boar low."
354,III.,In his rude boat made of the hollow trees
355,III.,"He drifts adventurous on the unoared seas,"
356,III.,"And, as he tilts upon the rocking tide,"
357,III.,Catches the glistening fish that flash and glide
358,III.,Innumerably through the waters wide.
359,III.,He'll fire the bush whose flames shall help him fel
360,III.,"The trunks to prop his roof, where he may dwell"
361,III.,"Beside the bubbling of a crystal well,"
362,III.,Sheltered from drenching rains or noxious glare
363,III.,"When the sun holds the zenith. Delving there,"
364,III.,"His cumbered wife, whose multifarious toil"
365,III.,"Seems never done, breaks the rich virgin soil,"
366,III.,And in the ashes casts the casual seeds
367,III.,Of feathered grass and efflorescent weeds;
368,III.,"When, as with thanks, the bounteous earth one morn"
369,III.,Returns lush blades of life-sustaining corn.
370,III.,"And while the woman digs and plants, and twines"
371,III.,"To precious use long reeds and pliant bines,"
372,III.,"He--having hit the brown bird on the wing,"
373,III.,"And slain the roe--returns at evening,"
374,III.,"And gives his spoil unto her, to prepare"
375,III.,"The succulent, wildwood scented, simmering fare,"
376,III.,While with impatient sniffs and eager-eyed
377,III.,His bronze-limbed children gather to his side.
378,III.,"And, when the feast is done, all take their ease,"
379,III.,Lulled by the sing-song of the evening breeze
380,III.,And murmuring undertones of many-foliaged trees;
381,III.,While here and there through rifts of green the sky
382,III.,Casts its blue glance like an all-seeing eye.
383,III.,But though by stress of want and poignant need
384,III.,"Man tames the wolf-sprung hound and rearing steed,"
385,III.,"Pens up the ram, and yokes the deep-horned ox,"
386,III.,And through wide pastures shepherds woolly flocks;
387,III.,"Though age by age, through discipline of toil,"
388,III.,"Man wring a richer harvest from the soil,"
389,III.,And in the grim and still renewing fight
390,III.,Slays loathly worms and beasts of gruesome might
391,III.,"By the close-knitted bondage of the clan,"
392,III.,Which adding up the puny strength of man
393,III.,Makes thousands move with one electric thrill
394,III.,"Of simultaneous, energetic will;"
395,III.,Yet still behind the narrow borderland
396,III.,"Where in security he seems to stand,"
397,III.,His apprehensive life is compassed round
398,III.,"By baffling mysteries he cannot sound,"
399,III.,"Where, big with terrors and calamities,"
400,III.,The future like a foe in ambush lies:
401,III.,"A muffled foe, that seems to watch and wait"
402,III.,With the Medusa eyes of stony fate.--
403,III.,"Great floods o'erwhelm and ruin his ripening grain,"
404,III.,"His boat is shattered by the hurricane,"
405,III.,From the rent cloud the tameless lightning springs--
406,III.,Heaven's flame-mouthed dragon with a roar of wings--
407,III.,And fires his hut and simple household things;
408,III.,Until before his horror-stricken eyes
409,III.,"The stored-up produce of long labour lies,"
410,III.,A heap of ashes smoking 'neath the skies.--
411,III.,"Or now the pastures where his flocks did graze,"
412,III.,"Parched, withered, shrivelled by the imminent blaze"
413,III.,"Of the great ball of fire that glares above,"
414,III.,Glow dry like iron heated in a stove;
415,III.,"Turning upon themselves, the tortured sheep,"
416,III.,"With blackening tongues, drop heap on gasping heap,"
417,III.,Their rotting flesh sickens the wind that moans
418,III.,And whistles poisoned through their chattering bones;
419,III.,"While the thin shepherd, staring sick and gaunt,"
420,III.,"Will search the thorns for berries, or yet haunt"
421,III.,The stony channels of some river-bed
422,III.,Where filtering fresh perchance a liquid thread
423,III.,"Of water may run clear.--Now dark o'erhead,"
424,III.,"Thickening with storm, the wintry clouds will loom,"
425,III.,And wrap the land in weeds of mournful gloom;
426,III.,Shrouding the sun and every lesser light
427,III.,"Till earth with all her aging woods grows white,"
428,III.,And hurrying streams stop fettered in their flight.
429,III.,"Then famished beasts freeze by the frozen lakes,"
430,III.,And thick as leaves dead birds bestrew the brakes;
431,III.,"And, cowering blankly by the flickering flame,"
432,III.,"Man feels a presence without form or name,"
433,III.,When by the bodies of his speechless dead
434,III.,In barbarous woe he bows his stricken head.
435,III.,Then in the hunger of his piteous love
436,III.,"He sends his thought, winged like a carrier dove--"
437,III.,"Through the unanswering silence void and vast,"
438,III.,Whence from dim hollows blows an icy blast--
439,III.,"To bring some sign, some little sign at last,"
440,III.,"From his lost chiefs--the beautiful, the brave--"
441,III.,"Vanished like bubbles on a breaking wave,"
442,III.,Lost in the unfathomed darkness of the grave.
443,III.,"When, lo, behold beside him in the night,--"
444,III.,"Softly beside him, like the noiseless light"
445,III.,Of moonbeams moving o'er the glimmering floor
446,III.,"That come unbidden through the bolted door,--"
447,III.,The lonely sleeper sees the lost one stand
448,III.,"Like one returned from some dim, distant land,"
449,III.,Bending towards him with his outstretched hand.
450,III.,"But when he fain would grasp it in his own,"
451,III.,He melts into thin moonshine and is gone--
452,III.,"A spirit now, who on the other shore"
453,III.,Of death hunts happily for evermore.--
454,III.,"A Son of Life, but dogged, while he draws breath,"
455,III.,"By her inseparable shadow--death,"
456,III.,"Man, feeble Man, whom unknown Fates appal,"
457,III.,With prayer and praise seeks to propitiate all
458,III.,"The spirits, who, for good or evil plight,"
459,III.,Bless him in victory or in sickness smite.
460,III.,"Those are his Dead who, wrapped in grisly shrouds,"
461,III.,"Now ride phantasmal on the rushing clouds,"
462,III.,Souls of departed chiefs whose livid forms
463,III.,"He sees careering on the reinless storms,"
464,III.,"Wild, spectral huntsmen who tumultuously,"
465,III.,"With loud halloo and shrilly echoing cry,"
466,III.,"Follow the furious chase, with the whole pack"
467,III.,Of shadowy hounds fierce yelping in the track
468,III.,Of wolves and bears as shadowy as the hosts
469,III.,Who lead once more as unsubstantial ghosts
470,III.,Their lives of old as restlessly they fly
471,III.,Across the wildernesses of the sky.
472,III.,"When the wild hunt is done, shall they not rest"
473,III.,"Their heads upon some swan-white maiden's breast,"
474,III.,And quaff their honeyed mead with godlike zest
475,III.,In golden-gated Halls whence they may see
476,III.,The earth and marvellous secrets of the Sea
477,III.,"Whereon the clouds will lie with grey wings furled,"
478,III.,"And in whose depths, voluminously curled,"
479,III.,The serpent looms whose girth engirds the world?
480,III.,"Far, far above now in supernal power"
481,III.,Those spirits rule the sunshine and the shower!
482,III.,"How shall he win their favour; yea, how move"
483,III.,"To pity the unpitying gods above,"
484,III.,"The Dæmon rulers of life's fitful dream,"
485,III.,"Who sway men's destinies, and still would seem"
486,III.,"To treat them lightly as a game of chance,"
487,III.,The sport of whim and blindfold circumstance--
488,III.,"The irresponsible, capricious gods,"
489,III.,So quick to please or anger; whose sharp rods
490,III.,Are storms and lightnings launched from cloven skies;
491,III.,"Who feast upon the shuddering victim's cries,"
492,III.,"The smell of blood, and human sacrifice."
493,III.,But ever as Man grows they grow with him;
494,III.,"Terrific, cruel, gentle, bright, or dim,"
495,III.,"With eyes of dove-like mercy, hands of wrath,"
496,III.,"Procession-like, they hover o'er his path"
497,III.,"And, changing with the gazer, borrow light"
498,III.,From their rapt devotee's adoring sight.
499,III.,"And Ormuzd, Ashtaroth, Osiris, Baal--"
500,III.,Love spending gods and gods of blood and wail--
501,III.,Look down upon their suppliant from the skies
502,III.,"With his own magnified, responsive eyes."
503,III.,"For Man, from want and pressing hunger freed,"
504,III.,"Begins to feel another kind of need,"
505,III.,And in his shaping brain and through his eyes
506,III.,"Nature, awakening, sees her blue-arched skies;"
507,III.,"The Sun, his life-begetter, isled in space;"
508,III.,"The Moon, the Measurer of his span of days;"
509,III.,The immemorial stars who pierce his night
510,III.,With inklings of things vast and infinite.
511,III.,All shows of heaven and earth that move and pass
512,III.,Take form within his brain as in a glass.
513,III.,The tidal thunder of the sea now roars
514,III.,And breaks symphonious on a hundred shores;
515,III.,The fitful flutings of the vagrant breeze
516,III.,Strike gusts of sound from virgin forest trees;
517,III.,White leaping waters of wild cataracts fall
518,III.,"From crag and jag in lapses musical,"
519,III.,And streams meandering amid daisied leas
520,III.,Throb with the pulses of tumultuous seas.
521,III.,"From hills and valleys smoking mists arise,"
522,III.,Steeped in pale gold and amethystine dyes.
523,III.,"The land takes colour from him, and the flowers"
524,III.,Laugh in his path like sun-dyed April showers.
525,III.,"The moving clouds in calm or thunderstorm,"
526,III.,"All shows of things in colour, sound, or form"
527,III.,"Moulded mysteriously, are freshly wrought"
528,III.,Within the fiery furnace of his thought.
529,III.,
530,IV.,IV.
531,IV.,
532,IV.,"No longer Nature's thrall,"
533,IV.,Man builds the city wall
534,IV.,That shall withstand her league of levelling storms;
535,IV.,He builds tremendous tombs
536,IV.,"Where, hid in hoarded glooms,"
537,IV.,His dead defy corruption with her worms:
538,IV.,"High towers he rears and bulks of glowing stone,"
539,IV.,Where the king rules upon a golden throne.
540,IV.,
541,IV.,"Creature of hopes and fears,"
542,IV.,"Of mirth and many tears,"
543,IV.,"He makes himself a thousand costly altars,"
544,IV.,"Whence smoke of sacrifice,"
545,IV.,"Fragrant with myrrh and spice,"
546,IV.,Ascends to heaven as the flame leaps and falters;
547,IV.,"Where, like a king above the Cloud control,"
548,IV.,God sits enthroned and rules Man's subject soul.
549,IV.,
550,IV.,Yet grievous here below
551,IV.,And manifold Man's woe;
552,IV.,"Though he can stay the flood and bind the waters,"
553,IV.,His hand he shall not stay
554,IV.,That bids him sack and slay
555,IV.,And turn the waving fields to fields of slaughters;
556,IV.,"And, as he reaps War's harvest grim and gory,"
557,IV.,Commits a thousand crimes and calls it glory.
558,IV.,
559,IV.,"Vast empires fall and rise,"
560,IV.,As when in sunset skies
561,IV.,The monumental clouds lift flashing towers
562,IV.,"With turrets, spires, and bars"
563,IV.,Lit by confederate stars
564,IV.,Till the bright rack dissolves in flying showers:
565,IV.,"Kingdoms on kingdoms have their fleeting day,"
566,IV.,"Dazzle the conquered world, and pass away."
567,IV.,
568,IV.,In golden Morning lands
569,IV.,"The blazing crowns change hands,"
570,IV.,"From mystic Ind to fleshly Babylon,"
571,IV.,"Assyria, Palestine"
572,IV.,"Armed with her book divine,"
573,IV.,Dread Persia whose fleet chariots charged and won
574,IV.,Pale Continents where prostrate monarchs kneel
575,IV.,Before the flash of her resistless steel.
576,IV.,
577,IV.,As one by one they start
578,IV.,With proudly beating heart
579,IV.,"Fast in the furious, fierce-contested race,"
580,IV.,Where neck to neck they strain
581,IV.,Deliriously to gain
582,IV.,"The winning post of power, the meed of praise;"
583,IV.,"Some drop behind, fall, or are trampled down"
584,IV.,While the proud victor grasps the laurel crown.
585,IV.,
586,IV.,Not only great campaigns
587,IV.,"Shall glorify their reigns,"
588,IV.,"But high-towered cities wondrous to behold,"
589,IV.,With gardens poised in air
590,IV.,"Like bowers of Eden fair,"
591,IV.,"With brazen gates and shrines of beaten gold,"
592,IV.,And Palace courts whose constellated lights
593,IV.,Shine on black slaves and cringing satellites.
594,IV.,
595,IV.,Eclipsing with her fate
596,IV.,Each power and rival state
597,IV.,"With her unnumbered stretch of generations,"
598,IV.,A sand-surrounded isle
599,IV.,"Fed by the bounteous Nile,"
600,IV.,Egypt confronts Sahara--sphinx of nations;
601,IV.,"Taught by the floods that make or mar her shore,"
602,IV.,She scans the stars and hoards mysterious lore.
603,IV.,
604,IV.,Hers are imperial halls
605,IV.,With strangely scriptured walls
606,IV.,"And long perspectives of memorial places,"
607,IV.,Where the hushed daylight glows
608,IV.,On mute colossal rows
609,IV.,"Of clawed wild beasts featured with female faces,"
610,IV.,And realmless kings inane whose stony eyes
611,IV.,Have watched the hour-glass of the centuries.
612,IV.,
613,IV.,There in the rainless sands
614,IV.,"The toil of captive hands,"
615,IV.,"That aye must do as their taskmaster bids,"
616,IV.,Through years of dusty days
617,IV.,Brick by slow brick shall raise
618,IV.,The incarnate pride of kings--the Pyramids--
619,IV.,Linked with some name synonymous with slaughter
620,IV.,Time has effaced like a name writ in water.
621,IV.,
622,IV.,"For ever with fateful shocks,"
623,IV.,"Roar as of hurtling rocks,"
624,IV.,"Start fresh embattled hosts with flags unfurled,"
625,IV.,To meet on battle-fields
626,IV.,"With clash of spears and shields,"
627,IV.,Widowing the world of men to win the world:
628,IV.,"The hissing air grows dark with iron rain,"
629,IV.,And groans the earth beneath her sheaves of slain.
630,IV.,
631,IV.,"Triumphant o'er them all,"
632,IV.,See crowns and sceptres fall
633,IV.,Before the arms of iron-soldered legions;
634,IV.,As Capitolian Rome
635,IV.,Across the salt sea foam
636,IV.,Orders her Cæsars to remotest regions:
637,IV.,From silver Spain and Albion's clouded seas
638,IV.,To the fair shrines and marble mines of Greece.
639,IV.,
640,IV.,"Pallas unmatched in war,"
641,IV.,To her triumphal car
642,IV.,Rome chains fallen despots and discrownèd queens
643,IV.,"With many a rampant beast,"
644,IV.,"Birds from the gorgeous East,"
645,IV.,And wool-haired Nubians torn from tropic scenes;
646,IV.,There huge barbarians from Druidic woods
647,IV.,Tower ominous o'er the humming multitudes;
648,IV.,
649,IV.,For still untamed and free
650,IV.,"In loathed captivity,"
651,IV.,"Their spirits bend not to the conqueror's yoke,"
652,IV.,Though for a Roman sight
653,IV.,They must in mimic fight
654,IV.,"Give wounds in play and deal Death's mortal stroke,"
655,IV.,While round the arena rings the fierce applause
656,IV.,"Voluptuous, as their bubbling life-blood flows"
657,IV.,
658,IV.,In streams of purple rain
659,IV.,From hecatombs of slain
660,IV.,"Saluting Cæsar still with failing breath,"
661,IV.,But in their dying souls
662,IV.,"Undying hate, which rolls"
663,IV.,"From land to land the avalanche of Death,"
664,IV.,"That, gathering volume as it sweeps along,"
665,IV.,Pours down the Alps throng on unnumbered throng.
666,IV.,
667,IV.,From northern hills and plains
668,IV.,"Storm-lashed by driving rains,"
669,IV.,"From moorland wastes and depths of desolate wood,"
670,IV.,"From many an icebound shore,"
671,IV.,"The human torrents pour,"
672,IV.,"Horde following upon horde as flood on flood,"
673,IV.,"Avengers of the slain they come, they come,"
674,IV.,And break in thunder on the walls of Rome.
675,IV.,
676,IV.,A trembling people waits
677,IV.,"As, surging through its gates,"
678,IV.,Break the fierce Goths with trumpet-blasts of doom;
679,IV.,And many a glorious shrine
680,IV.,"Begins to flare and shine,"
681,IV.,"And many a palace flames up through the gloom,"
682,IV.,Kindled like torches by relentless wrath
683,IV.,To light the Spoiler on destruction's path.
684,IV.,
685,IV.,"Yea, with Rome's ravished walls,"
686,IV.,The old world tottering falls
687,IV.,And crumbles into ruin wide and vast;
688,IV.,The Empire seems to rock
689,IV.,"As with an earthquake's shock,"
690,IV.,And vassal provinces look on aghast;
691,IV.,"As realms are split and nation rent from nation,"
692,IV.,The globe seems drifting to annihilation.
693,IV.,
694,V.,V.
695,V.,
696,V.,"""Peace on earth and good will unto Men!"""
697,V.,Came the tidings borne o'er wide dominions;
698,V.,The glad tidings thrilled the world as when
699,V.,"Spring comes fluttering on the west wind's pinions,"
700,V.,When her voice is heard
701,V.,"Warbling through each bird,"
702,V.,And a new-born hope
703,V.,Throbs through all things infinite in scope.
704,V.,

1186,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1187,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,A fluttering dream driven hither and thither.--
1188,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"The fitful flare of the moon fled fast,"

1190,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1191,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,Now dark like a scowl in the hurrying blast
1192,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,As ominous shadows swept over the roofs
1193,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,Where white as a ghost the scared moonlight had passed.
1194,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1195,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Curses came mingled with wails and reproofs,"
1196,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"With doors banging to and the crashing of glass,"

1198,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1199,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"With the rush of the river as, huddling its mass"
1200,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Of weltering water towards the deep ocean,"
1201,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,'Neath many-arched bridges its eddies did pass.
1202,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1203,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,A hubbub of voices in savage commotion
1204,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Was mixed with the storm in a chaos of sound,"
1205,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,And thrilled as with ague in shuddering emotion
1206,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1207,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,I fled as the hunted hare flees from the hound.
1208,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,Past churches whose bells were tumultuously ringing
1209,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"The year in, and clashing in concord around;"
1210,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1211,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,Past the deaf walls of dungeons whose curses seemed clinging
1212,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,To the tempest that shivered and shrieked in amazement;
1213,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,Past brightly lit mansions whence music and singing
1214,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1215,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Came borne like a scent through the close-curtained casement,"
1216,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,To vaults in whose shadow wild outcasts were hiding
1217,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,Their misery deep in the gloom of the basement.
1218,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1219,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,By vociferous taverns where women were biding
1220,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"With features all withered, distorted, aghast;"
1221,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Some sullenly silent, some brutally chiding,"
1222,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1223,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,Some reeling away into gloom as I passed
1224,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"On, on, through lamp-lighted and fountain-filled places,"
1225,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Where throned in rich temples, resplendent and vast,"
1226,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1227,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,The Lord of the City is deafened with praises
1228,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,As worshipping multitudes kneel as of old;
1229,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Nor care for the crowds of cadaverous faces,"
1230,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1231,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,The men that are marred and the maids that are sold--
1232,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,Inarticulate masses promiscuously jumbled
1233,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,And crushed 'neath their Juggernaut idol of gold.
1234,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1235,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Lost lives of great cities bespattered and tumbled,"
1236,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Black rags the rain soaks, the wind whips like a knout,"
1237,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Were crouched in the streets there, and o'er them nigh stumbled"
1238,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1239,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,A swarm of light maids as they tripped to some rout.
1240,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,The silk of their raiment voluptuously hisses
1241,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,And flaps o'er the flags as loud laughing they flout
1242,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1243,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,The wine-maddened men they ne'er satiate with kisses
1244,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"For the pearls and the diamonds that make them more fair,"
1245,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"For the flash of large jewels that fire them with blisses,"
1246,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1247,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,For the glitter of gold in the gold of their hair.
1248,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"They smiled and they cozened, their bold eyes shone brightly"
1249,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"And lightened with laughter, as, lit by the flare"
1250,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1251,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Of the wind-fretted gas-lamps, they footed it lightly,"
1252,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Or, closely enlacing and bowered in gloom,"
1253,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"With mouth pressed to hot mouth, their parched lips drain nightly"
1254,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1255,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,The wine-cup of pleasure red-sealing their doom.
1256,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Brief lives like bright rockets which, aridly glowing,"
1257,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,Fall burnt out to ashes and reel to the tomb.
1258,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1259,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"On, on, loud and louder the rough night was blowing,"
1260,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,Shrill singing was mixed with strange cries of despair;
1261,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"And high overhead the black sky, redly glowing,"
1262,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1263,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Loomed over the city one ominous glare,"
1264,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,As dark yawning funnels from foul throats for ever
1265,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Belched smoke grimly flaming, which outraged the air."
1266,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1267,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"On, on, by long quays where the lamps in the river"
1268,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Were writhing like serpents that hiss ere they drown,"
1269,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"And poplars with palsy seemed coldly to shiver,"
1270,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1271,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"On, on, to the bare desert end of the town."
1272,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"When lo! the wind stopped like a heart that's ceased beating,"
1273,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"And nought but the waters, white foaming and brown,"
1274,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1275,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,Were heard as to seaward their currents went fleeting.
1276,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"But hark! o'er the lull breaks a desolate moan,"
1277,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,Like a little lost lamb's that is timidly bleating
1278,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1279,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"When, strayed from the shepherd, it staggers alone"
1280,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"By tracks which the mountain streams shake with their thunder,"
1281,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,Where death seems to gape from each boulder and stone.
1282,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1283,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,I turned to the murmur: the clouds swept asunder
1284,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,And wheeled like white sea-gulls around the white moon;
1285,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"And the moon, like a white maid, looked down in mute wonder"
1286,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1287,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,On a boy whose wan eyelids were closed as in swoon.
1288,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Half nude on the ground he lay, wasted and chilly,"
1289,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,And torn as with thorns and sharp brambles of June;
1290,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1291,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"His hair, like a flame which at twilight burns stilly,"
1292,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"In a halo of light round his temples was blown,"
1293,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,And his tears fell like rain on a storm-stricken lily
1294,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1295,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Where he lay on the cold ground, abandoned, alone."
1296,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"With heart moved towards him in wondering pity,"
1297,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,I tenderly seized his thin hand with my own:
1298,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1299,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Crying, ""Child, say how cam'st thou so far from the city?"
1300,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"How cam'st thou alone in such pitiful plight,"
1301,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"All blood-stained thy feet, with rags squalid and gritty,"
1302,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1303,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"A waif by the wayside, unhoused in the night?"""
1304,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Then rose he and lifted the bright locks, storm driven,"
1305,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Which flamed round his forehead and clouded his sight,"
1306,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1307,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,And mournful as meres on a moorland at even
1308,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,His blue eyes flashed wildly through tears as they fell.
1309,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Strange eyes full of horror, yet fuller of heaven,"
1310,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1311,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,Like eyes that from heaven have looked upon hell.
1312,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"The eyes of an angel whose depths show where, burning"
1313,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"And lost in the pit, toss the angels that fell."
1314,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1315,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""Ah,"" wailed he in tones full of agonized yearning,"
1316,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,Like the plaintive lament of a sickening dove
1317,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"On a surf-beaten shore, whence it sees past returning"
1318,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1319,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"The wings of the wild flock fast fading above,"
1320,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,As they melt on the sky-line like foam-flakes in motion:
1321,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"So sadly he wailed, ""I am Love! I am Love!"
1322,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1323,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""Behold me cast out as weed spurned of the ocean,"
1324,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Half nude on the bare ground, and covered with scars"
1325,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"I perish of cold here;"" and, choked with emotion,"
1326,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1327,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,Gave a sob: at the low sob a shower of stars
1328,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Broke shuddering from heaven, pale flaming, and fell"
1329,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,Where the mid-city roared as with rumours of wars.
1330,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1331,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""Be these God's tears?"" I cried, as my tears 'gan to well."
1332,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""Ah, Love, I have sought thee in temples and towers,"
1333,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"In shrines where men pray, and in marts where they sell;"
1334,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1335,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""In tapestried chambers made tropic with flowers,"
1336,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Where amber-haired women, soft breathing of spice,"
1337,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,Lay languidly lapped in the gold-dropping showers
1338,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1339,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""Which gladdened and maddened their amorous eyes."
1340,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,I have looked for thee vainly in churches where beaming
1341,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"The Saints glowed embalmed in a prism of dyes,"
1342,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1343,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""Where wave over wave the rapt music went streaming"
1344,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,With breakers of sound in full anthems elate.
1345,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"I have asked, but none knew thee, or knew but thy seeming;"
1346,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1347,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""A mask in thy likeness on high seats of state;"
1348,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"And they bound it with gold, and they crowned it with glory,"
1349,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"This thing they called love, which was bond slave to hate."
1350,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1351,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""And they bowed down before it with brown heads and hoary,"
1352,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"They worshipped it nightly, loud hymning its praise,"
1353,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"While out in the cold blast, none heeding its story,"
1354,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1355,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""Love staggers, an outcast, with lust in its place."""
1356,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Love shivered and sighed like a reed that is shaken,"
1357,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,And lifting his hunger-nipped face to my face:
1358,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1359,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""Nay, if of the world I must needs die forsaken,"
1360,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,Say thou wilt not leave me to dearth and despair.
1361,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"To thy heart, to thy home, let the exile be taken,"
1362,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1363,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""And feed me and shelter----"" ""Where, outcast, ah, where?"
1364,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,Like thee I am homeless and spurned of all mortals;
1365,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,The House of my fathers yawns wide to the air.
1366,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1367,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""Stalks desolation across the void portals,"
1368,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Hope lies aghast on the ruinous floor,"

1370,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1371,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""With gods statue-still o'er the world-whirr and roar,"
1372,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"With fauns of the forest and nymphs of the river,"
1373,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,Are cleft as if lightning had struck to their core.
1374,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1375,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""The luminous ceilings, where soaring for ever"
1376,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Dim hosts of plumed angels smoked up to the sky,"
1377,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,With God-litten faces that yearned to the giver
1378,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1379,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""As vapours of morning the sun draws on high,"
1380,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,Now ravaged with rain hear the hollow winds whistle

1382,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1383,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""Blest walls that were vowed to the Virgin now bristle"
1384,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"With weeds of sick scarlet and plague-spotted moss,"
1385,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"And stained on the ground, choked with thorn and rank thistle,"
1386,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1387,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""Rots a worm-eaten Christ on a mouldering Cross."
1388,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"From the House of my fathers, distraught, broken-hearted,"
1389,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"With a pang of immense, irredeemable loss,"
1390,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1391,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""On my wearying pilgrimage blindly I started"
1392,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"To seek thee, oh Love, in high places and low,"
1393,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"And instead of the glories for ever departed,"
1394,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1395,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""To warm my starved life in thy mightier glow."
1396,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"For I deemed thee a Presence ringed round with all splendour,"
1397,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,With a sceptre in hand and a crown on thy brow;
1398,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1399,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""And, behold, thou art helpless--most helpless to tender"
1400,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Thy service to others, who needest their care."
1401,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Yea, now that I find thee a weak child and slender,"
1402,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1403,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""Exposed to the blast of the merciless air,"
1404,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Like a lamb that is shorn, like a leaf that is shaken,"
1405,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"What, Love, now is left but to die in despair?"
1406,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1407,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""For Death is the mother of all the forsaken,"
1408,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"The grave a strait bed where she rocks them to rest,"
1409,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"And sleep, from whose silence they never shall waken,"
1410,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1411,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""The balm of oblivion she sheds on their breast."""
1412,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Then I seized him and led to the brink of the river,"
1413,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Where two storm-beaten seagulls were fluttering west,"
1414,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1415,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"And the lamplight in drowning seemed coldly to shiver,"
1416,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"And clasping Love close for the leap from on high,"
1417,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Said--""Let us go hence, Love; go home, Love, for ever;"
1418,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1419,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""For life casts us forth, and Man dooms us to die."""
1420,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"As if stung by a snake the Child shuddered and started,"
1421,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,And clung to me close with a passionate cry:
1422,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1423,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""Stay with me, stay with me, poor, broken-hearted;"
1424,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Pain, if not pleasure, we two will divide;"
1425,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Though with the sins of the world I have smarted,"
1426,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1427,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""Though with the shame of the world thou art dyed,"
1428,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Weak as I am, on thy breast I'll recover,"
1429,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Worn as thou art, thou shalt bloom as my bride:"
1430,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1431,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"""Bloom as the flower of the World for the lover"
1432,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Whom thou hast found in a lost little Child."""
1433,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,And as he kissed my lips over and over--
1434,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1435,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Child now, or Man, was it who thus beguiled?--"
1436,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Even as I looked on him, Love, waxing slowly,"
1437,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Grew as a little cloud, floating enisled,"
1438,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1439,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,Which spreads out aloft in the blue sky till solely
1440,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"It fills the deep ether tremendous in height,"
1441,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,With far-flashing snow-peaks and pinnacles wholly
1442,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1443,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Invisible, vanishing light within light."
1444,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"So changing waxed Love--till he towered before me,"
1445,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,Outgrowing my lost gods in stature and might.
1446,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1447,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"As he grew, as he drew me, a great awe came o'er me,"
1448,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"And stammering, I shook as I questioned his name;"
1449,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"But gently bowed o'er me, he soothèd and bore me,"
1450,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1451,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Yea, bore once again to the haunts whence I came,"
1452,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"By dark ways and dreary, by rough roads and gritty,"
1453,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"To the penfolds of sin, to the purlieus of shame."
1454,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,
1455,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"And lo, as we went through the woe-clouded city,"
1456,_THE PILGRIM SOUL._,"Where women bring forth and men labour in vain,"

1535,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Smitten chords which tempest-stricken render
1536,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Rhythms of anguish from a breaking lyre.
1537,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1538,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Love had left me in a land of shadows,"
1539,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Lonely on the ruins of delight,"
1540,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"And I grieved with tearless grief of widows,"
1541,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Moaned as orphans homeless in the night.
1542,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Love had left me knocking at Death's portal--
1543,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Shone his star and vanished from my sky--
1544,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"And I cried: ""Since Love, even Love, is mortal,"
1545,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Take, unmake, and break me; let me die."""
1546,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1547,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Then, the twilight's grisly veils dividing,"
1548,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Phantom-like there stole one o'er the plain,"
1549,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Wavering mists for ever round it gliding
1550,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Hid the face I strove to scan in vain.
1551,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Spake the veiled one: ""Solitary weeper,"
1552,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,'Mid the myriad mourners thou'rt but one:
1553,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Come, and thou shalt see the awful reaper,"
1554,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Evil, reaping all beneath the sun."""
1555,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1556,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,On my hand the clay-cold hand did fasten
1557,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"As it murmured--""Up and follow me;"
1558,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"O'er the thickly peopled earth we'll hasten,"
1559,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Yet more thickly packed with misery."""
1560,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,And I followed: ever in the shadow
1561,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Of that looming form I fared along;
1562,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Now o'er mountains, now through wood and meadow,"
1563,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Or through cities with their surging throng.
1564,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1565,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,With none other for a friend or fellow
1566,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Those relentless footsteps were my guide
1567,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,To the sea-caves echoing with the hollow
1568,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Immemorial moaning of the tide.
1569,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Laughed the sunlight on the living ocean,"
1570,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Danced and rocked itself upon the spray,"
1571,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,And its shivered beams in twinkling motion
1572,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Gleamed like star-motes in the Milky Way.
1573,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1574,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Lo, beneath those waters surging, flowing,"
1575,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,I beheld the Deep's fantastic bowers;
1576,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Shapes which seemed alive and yet were growing
1577,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,On their stalks like animated flowers.
1578,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Sentient flowers which seemed to glow and glimmer
1579,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Soft as ocean blush of Indian shells,"
1580,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,White as foam-drift in the moony shimmer
1581,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Of those sea-lit, wave-pavilioned dells."
1582,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1583,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Yet even here, as in the fire-eyed panther,"
1584,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"In disguise the eternal hunger lay,"
1585,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"For each feathery, velvet-tufted anther"
1586,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Lay in ambush waiting for its prey.
1587,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Tiniest jewelled fish that flashed like lightning,"
1588,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Blindly drawn, came darting through the wave,"
1589,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"When, a stifling sack above them tightening,"
1590,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Closed the ocean-blossom's living grave.
1591,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1592,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Now we fared through forest glooms primeval
1593,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Through whose leaves the light but rarely shone,"
1594,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Where the buttressed tree-trunks looked coeval
1595,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"With the time-worn, ocean-fretted stone;"
1596,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Where, from stem to stem their tendrils looping,"
1597,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Coiled the lithe lianas fold on fold,"
1598,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Or, in cataracts of verdure drooping,"
1599,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,From on high their billowy leafage rolled.
1600,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1601,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Where beneath the dusky woodland cover,"
1602,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"While the noon-hush holds all living things,"
1603,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Butterflies of tropic splendour hover
1604,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,In a maze of rainbow-coloured wings:
1605,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Some like stars light up their own green heaven
1606,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Some are spangled like a golden toy,"
1607,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Or like flowers from their foliage driven
1608,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,In the fiery ecstasy of joy.
1609,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1610,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"But, the forest slumber rudely breaking,"
1611,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Through the silence rings a piercing yell;
1612,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"At the cry unnumbered beasts, awaking,"
1613,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,With their howls the loud confusion swell.
1614,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,'Tis the cry of some frail creature panting
1615,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,In the tiger's lacerating grip;
1616,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"In its flesh carnivorous teeth implanting,"
1617,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,While the blood smokes round his wrinkled lip.
1618,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1619,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"'Tis the scream some bird in terror utters,"
1620,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"With its wings weighed down by leaden fears,"
1621,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,As from bough to downward bough it flutters
1622,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Where the snake its glistening crest uprears:
1623,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Eyes of sluggish greed through rank weeds stealing,"
1624,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Breath whose venomous fumes mount through the air,"
1625,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Till benumbed the helpless victim, reeling,"
1626,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Drops convulsed into the reptile snare.
1627,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1628,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Now we fared o'er sweltering wastes whose steaming
1629,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Clouds of tawny sand the wanderer blind.
1630,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Herds of horses with their long manes streaming
1631,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Snorted thirstily against the wind;
1632,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"O'er the waste they scoured in shadowy numbers,"
1633,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Gasped for springs their raging thirst to cool,"
1634,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"And, like sick men mocked in fevered slumbers,"
1635,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Stoop to drink--and find a phantom pool.
1636,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1637,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,What of antelopes crunched by the leopard?
1638,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,What if hounds run down the timid hare?
1639,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"What though sheep, strayed from the faithful shepherd,"
1640,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Perish helpless in the lion's lair?
1641,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"The all-seeing sun shines on unheeding,"
1642,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"In the night shines the unruffled moon,"
1643,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Though on earth brute myriads, preying, bleeding,"
1644,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Put creation harshly out of tune.
1645,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1646,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Cried I, turning to the shrouded figure--"
1647,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"""Oh, in mercy veil this cruel strife!"
1648,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Sanguinary orgies which disfigure
1649,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,The green ways of labyrinthine life.
1650,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"From the needs and greeds of primal passion,"
1651,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"From the serpent's track and lion's den,"
1652,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"To the world our human hands did fashion,"
1653,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Lead me to the kindly haunts of men."""
1654,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1655,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"And through fields of corn we passed together,"
1656,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Orange golden in the brooding heat,"
1657,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Where brown reapers in the harvest weather
1658,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Cut ripe swathes of downward rustling wheat.
1659,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"In the orchards dangling red and yellow,"
1660,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Clustered fruit weighed down the bending sprays;
1661,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,On a hundred hills the vines grew mellow
1662,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,In the warmth of fostering autumn days.
1663,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1664,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Through the air the shrilly twittering swallows
1665,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Flashed their nimble shadows on the leas;
1666,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Red-flecked cows were glassed in golden shallows,"
1667,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Purple clover hummed with restless bees.
1668,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Herdsmen drove the cattle from the mountain,"
1669,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"To the fold the shepherd drove his flocks,"
1670,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Village girls drew water from the fountain,"
1671,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Village yokels piled the full-eared shocks.
1672,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1673,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"From the white town dozing in the valley,"
1674,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Round its vast Cathedral's solemn shade,"
1675,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Citizens strolled down the walnut alley
1676,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Where youth courted and glad childhood played.
1677,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"""Peace on earth,"" I murmured; ""let us linger--"
1678,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Here the wage of life seems good at least:"""
1679,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,As I spake the veiled One raised a finger
1680,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Where the moon broke flowering in the east.
1681,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1682,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Faintly muttering from deep mountain ranges,"
1683,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Muffled sounds rose hoarsely on the night,"
1684,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,As the crash of foundering avalanches
1685,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Wakes hoarse echoes in each Alpine height.
1686,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Near and nearer sounds the roaring--thunder,"
1687,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Mortal thunder, crashes through the vale;"
1688,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Lightning flash of muskets breaks from under
1689,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Groves once haunted by the nightingale.
1690,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1691,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Men clutch madly at each weapon--women,"
1692,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Children crouch in cellars, under roofs,"
1693,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,For the town is circled by their foemen--
1694,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Shakes the ground with clang of trampling hoofs.
1695,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Shot on shot the volleys hiss and rattle,"
1696,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Shrilly whistling fly the murderous balls,"
1697,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Fiercely roars the tumult of the battle
1698,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Round the hard-contested, dear-bought walls."
1699,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1700,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Horror, horror! The fair town is burning,"
1701,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Flames burst forth, wild sparks and ashes fly;"
1702,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,With her children's blood the green earth's turning
1703,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Blood-red--blood-red, too, the cloud-winged sky."
1704,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Crackling flare the streets: from the lone steeple
1705,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"The great clock booms forth its ancient chime,"
1706,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,And its dolorous quarters warn the people
1707,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Of the conquering troops that march with time.
1708,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1709,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Fallen lies the fair old town, its houses"
1710,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Charred and ruined gape in smoking heaps;
1711,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Here with shouts a ruffian band carouses,"
1712,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,There an outraged woman vainly weeps.
1713,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"In the fields where the ripe corn lies mangled,"
1714,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Where the wounded groan beneath the dead,"
1715,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Friend and foe, now helplessly entangled,"
1716,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Stain red poppies with a guiltier red.
1717,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1718,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"There the dog howls o'er his perished master,"
1719,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,There the crow comes circling from afar;
1720,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,All vile things that batten on disaster
1721,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Follow feasting in the wake of war.
1722,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Famine follows--what they ploughed and planted
1723,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,The unhappy peasants shall not reap;
1724,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Sickening of strange meats and fever haunted,"
1725,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,To their graves they prematurely creep.
1726,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1727,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"""Hence""--I cried in unavailing pity--"
1728,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"""Let us flee these scenes of monstrous strife,"
1729,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Seek the pale of some imperial city
1730,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Where the law rules starlike o'er man's life."""
1731,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Straightway floating o'er blue sea and river,"
1732,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"We were plunged into a roaring cloud,"
1733,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Wherethrough lamps in ague fits did shiver
1734,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,O'er the surging multitudinous crowd.
1735,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1736,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Piles of stone, their cliff-like walls uprearing,"
1737,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Flashed in luminous lines along the night;
1738,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Jets of flame, spasmodically flaring,"
1739,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Splashed black pavements with a sickly light;
1740,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Fabulous gems shone here, and glowing coral,"
1741,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Shimmering stuffs from many an Eastern loom,"
1742,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,And vast piles of tropic fruits and floral
1743,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Marvels seemed to mock November's gloom.
1744,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1745,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"But what prowls near princely mart and dwelling,"
1746,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Whence through many a thundering thoroughfare
1747,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Rich folk roll on cushions softly swelling
1748,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,To the week-day feast and Sunday prayer?
1749,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Yea, who prowl there, hunger-nipped and pallid,"
1750,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Breathing nightmares limned upon the gloom?
1751,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"'Tis but human rubbish, gaunt and squalid,"
1752,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Whom their country spurns for lack of room.
1753,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1754,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"In their devious track we mutely follow,"
1755,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Mutely climb dim flights of oozy stairs,"
1756,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Where through gap-toothed, mizzling roof the yellow"
1757,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Pestilent fog blends with the fetid air.
1758,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Through the unhinged door's discordant slamming
1759,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Ring the gruesome sounds of savage strife--
1760,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Howls of babes, the drunken father's damning,"
1761,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Counter-cursing of the shrill-tongued wife.
1762,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1763,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Children feebly crying on their mother
1764,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"In a wailful chorus--""Give us food!"""
1765,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Man and woman glaring at each other
1766,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Like two gaunt wolves with a famished brood.
1767,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Till he snatched a stick, and, madly staring,"
1768,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Struck her blow on blow upon the head;
1769,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"And she, reeling back, gasped, hardly caring--"
1770,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"""Ah, you've done it now, Jim""--and was dead."
1771,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1772,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Dead--dead--dead--the miserable creature--
1773,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Never to feel hunger's cruel fang
1774,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Wring the bowels of rebellious nature
1775,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,That her infants might be spared the pang.
1776,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"""Dead! Good luck to her!"" The man's teeth chattered,"
1777,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Stone-still stared he with blank eyes and hard,"
1778,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Then, his frame with one big sob nigh shattered,"
1779,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Fled--and cut his throat down in the yard.
1780,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1781,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Dark the night--the children wail forsaken,"
1782,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Crane their wrinkled necks and cry for food,"
1783,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Drop off into fitful sleep, or waken"
1784,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Trembling like a sparrow's ravished brood.
1785,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Dark the night--the rain falls on the ashes,"
1786,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Feebly hissing on the feeble heat,"
1787,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Filters through the ceiling, drops in splashes"
1788,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,On the little children's naked feet.
1789,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1790,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Dark the night--the children wail forsaken--
1791,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Is there none, ah, none, to heed their moan?"
1792,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Yea, at dawn one little one is taken,"
1793,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Four poor souls are left, but one is gone."
1794,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Gone--escaped--flown from the shame and sorrow
1795,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Waiting for them at life's sombre gate,"
1796,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,But the hand of merciless to-morrow
1797,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Drags the others shuddering to their fate.
1798,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1799,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,But one came--a girlish thing--a creature
1800,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Flung by wanton hands 'mid lust and crime--
1801,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"A poor outcast, yet by right of nature"
1802,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Sweet as odour of the upland thyme.
1803,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Scapegoat of a people's sins, and hunted,"
1804,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Howled at, hooted to the wilderness,"
1805,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"To that wilderness of deaf hearts, blunted"
1806,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,To the depths of woman's dumb distress.
1807,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1808,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Jetsam, flotsam of the monster city,"
1809,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Spurned, defiled, reviled, that outcast came"
1810,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"To those babes that whined for love and pity,"
1811,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Gave them bread bought with the wage of shame.
1812,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Gave them bread, and gave them warm, maternal"
1813,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Kisses not on sale for any price:
1814,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Yea, a spark, a flash of some eternal"
1815,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Sympathy shone through those haunted eyes.
1816,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1817,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Ah, perchance through her dark life's confusion,"
1818,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Through the haste and taste of fevered hours,"
1819,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Gusts of memory on her youth's pollution
1820,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Blew forgotten scents of faded flowers.
1821,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"And she saw the cottage near the wild wood,"
1822,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"With its lichened roof and latticed panes,"
1823,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Strayed once more through golden fields of childhood,"
1824,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Hyacinth dells and hawthorn-scented lanes.
1825,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1826,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Heard once more the song of nesting thrushes
1827,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"And the blackbird's long mellifluous note,"
1828,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Felt once more the glow of maiden blushes
1829,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Burn through rosy cheek and milkwhite throat
1830,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,In that orchard where the apple blossom
1831,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Lightly shaken fluttered on her hair,"
1832,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,As the heart was fluttering in her bosom
1833,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,When her sweetheart came and kissed her there.
1834,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1835,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Often came he in the lilac-laden
1836,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Moonlit twilight, often pledged his word;"
1837,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"But she was a simple country-maiden,"
1838,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,He the offspring of a noble lord.
1839,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Fading lilacs May's farewell betoken,"
1840,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Fledglings fly and soon forget the nest;
1841,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Lightly may a young man's vows be broken,"
1842,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,And the heart break in a woman's breast.
1843,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1844,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Gathered like a sprig of summer roses
1845,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"In the dewy morn and flung away,"
1846,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"To the girl the father's door now closes,"
1847,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Let her shelter henceforth how she may.
1848,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Who will house the miserable mother

1850,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"""I, am I the keeper of my brother?"""
1851,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Asks smug virtue as it turns to pray!
1852,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1853,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Lovely are the earliest Lenten lilies,"
1854,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Primrose pleiads, hyacinthine sheets;"
1855,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Stripped and rifled from their pastoral valleys,"
1856,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,See them sold now in the public streets!
1857,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Other flowers are sold there besides posies--
1858,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Eyes may have the hyacinth's glowing blue,"
1859,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,"Rounded cheeks the velvet bloom of roses,"
1860,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,Taper necks the rain-washed lily's hue.
1861,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,
1862,_THE LEADING OF SORROW._,But a rustic blossom! Love and duty

2231,_THE TEAMSTER._,"As nice as women, but not near so skittish;"
2232,_THE TEAMSTER._,"He fondles, cossets, scolds them now and then,"
2233,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Nay, gravely talks as if they knew good British:"
2234,_THE TEAMSTER._,"You hear him call from dawn to set of sun,"
2235,_THE TEAMSTER._,"""Goo back! Com on!"""
2236,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2237,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Sam never seems depressed nor yet elate,"
2238,_THE TEAMSTER._,Like Nature's self he goes his punctual round;
2239,_THE TEAMSTER._,"On Sundays, smoking by his garden gate,"
2240,_THE TEAMSTER._,"For hours he'll stand, with eyes upon the ground,"
2241,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Like some tired cart-horse in a field alone,"
2242,_THE TEAMSTER._,And still as stone.
2243,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2244,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Yet, howsoever stolid he may seem,"
2245,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Sam has his tragic background, weird and wild"
2246,_THE TEAMSTER._,Like some adventure in a drunkard's dream.
2247,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Impossible, you'd swear, for one so mild:"
2248,_THE TEAMSTER._,Yet village gossips dawdling o'er their ale
2249,_THE TEAMSTER._,Still tell the tale.
2250,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2251,_THE TEAMSTER._,"In his young days Sam loved a servant-maid,"
2252,_THE TEAMSTER._,A girl with happy eyes like hazel brooks
2253,_THE TEAMSTER._,"That dance i' the sun, cheeks as if newly made"
2254,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Of pouting roses coyly hid in nooks,"
2255,_THE TEAMSTER._,And warm brown hair that wantoned into curl:
2256,_THE TEAMSTER._,A fresh-blown girl.
2257,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2258,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Sam came a-courting while the year was blithe,"
2259,_THE TEAMSTER._,"When wet browed mowers, stepping out in tune,"
2260,_THE TEAMSTER._,"With level stroke and rhythmic swing of scythe,"
2261,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Smote down the proud grass in the pomp of June,"
2262,_THE TEAMSTER._,"And wagons, half-tipped over, seemed to sway"
2263,_THE TEAMSTER._,With loads of hay.
2264,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2265,_THE TEAMSTER._,The elder bush beside the orchard croft
2266,_THE TEAMSTER._,Brimmed over with its bloom like curds and cream;
2267,_THE TEAMSTER._,From out grey nests high in the granary loft
2268,_THE TEAMSTER._,Black clusters of small heads with callow scream
2269,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Peered open-beaked, as swallows flashed along"
2270,_THE TEAMSTER._,To feed their young.
2271,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2272,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Ripening towards the harvest swelled the wheat,"
2273,_THE TEAMSTER._,Lush cherries dangled 'gainst the latticed panes;
2274,_THE TEAMSTER._,"The roads were baking in the windless heat,"
2275,_THE TEAMSTER._,"And dust had floured the glossy country lanes,"
2276,_THE TEAMSTER._,"One sun-hushed, light-flushed Sunday afternoon"
2277,_THE TEAMSTER._,The last of June.
2278,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2279,_THE TEAMSTER._,"When, with his thumping heart all out of joint,"
2280,_THE TEAMSTER._,"And pulses beating like a stroller's drum,"
2281,_THE TEAMSTER._,Sam screwed his courage to the sticking point
2282,_THE TEAMSTER._,And asked his blushing sweetheart if she'd come
2283,_THE TEAMSTER._,To Titsey Fair; he meant to coax coy May
2284,_THE TEAMSTER._,To name the day.
2285,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2286,_THE TEAMSTER._,But her rich master snapped his thumb and swore
2287,_THE TEAMSTER._,The girl was not for him! Should not go out!
2288,_THE TEAMSTER._,"And, whistling to his dogs, slammed-to the door"
2289,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Close in Sam's face, and left him dazed without"
2290,_THE TEAMSTER._,"In the fierce sunshine, blazing in his path"
2291,_THE TEAMSTER._,Like fire of wrath.
2292,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2293,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Unheeding, he went forth with hot wild eyes"
2294,_THE TEAMSTER._,Past fields of feathery oats and wine-red clover;
2295,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Unheeded, larks soared singing to the skies,"
2296,_THE TEAMSTER._,Or rang the plaintive cry of rising plover;
2297,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Unheeded, pheasants with a startled sound"
2298,_THE TEAMSTER._,Whirred from the ground.
2299,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2300,_THE TEAMSTER._,"On, on he went by acres full of grain,"
2301,_THE TEAMSTER._,"By trees and meadows reeling past his sight,"
2302,_THE TEAMSTER._,As to a man whirled onwards in a train
2303,_THE TEAMSTER._,The land with spinning hedgerows seems in flight;
2304,_THE TEAMSTER._,"At last he stopped and leant a long, long while"
2305,_THE TEAMSTER._,Against a stile.
2306,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2307,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Hours passed; the clock struck ten; a hush of night,"
2308,_THE TEAMSTER._,In which even wind and water seemed at peace;
2309,_THE TEAMSTER._,But here and there a glimmering cottage light
2310,_THE TEAMSTER._,Shone like a glowworm through the slumberous trees;
2311,_THE TEAMSTER._,Or from some far-off homestead through the dark
2312,_THE TEAMSTER._,A watch-dog's bark.
2313,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2314,_THE TEAMSTER._,But all at once Sam gave a stifled cry:
2315,_THE TEAMSTER._,"""There's fire,"" he muttered, ""fire upon the hills!"""
2316,_THE TEAMSTER._,No fire--but as the late moon rose on high
2317,_THE TEAMSTER._,Her light looked smoke-red as through belching mills:
2318,_THE TEAMSTER._,No fire--but moonlight turning in his path
2319,_THE TEAMSTER._,To fire of wrath.
2320,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2321,_THE TEAMSTER._,He looked abroad with eyes that gave the mist
2322,_THE TEAMSTER._,A lurid tinge above the breadths of grain
2323,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Owned by May's master. Then he shook his fist,"
2324,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Still muttering, ""Fire!"" and measured o'er again"
2325,_THE TEAMSTER._,"The road he'd come, where, lapped in moonlight, lay"
2326,_THE TEAMSTER._,Huge ricks of hay.
2327,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2328,_THE TEAMSTER._,There he paused glaring. Then he turned and waned
2329,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Like mist into the misty, moon-soaked night,"
2330,_THE TEAMSTER._,Where the pale silvery fields were blotched and stained
2331,_THE TEAMSTER._,With strange fantastic shadows. But what light
2332,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Is that which leaps up, flickering lithe and long,"
2333,_THE TEAMSTER._,With licking tongue!
2334,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2335,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Hungry it darts and hisses, twists and turns,"
2336,_THE TEAMSTER._,"And with each minute shoots up high and higher,"
2337,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Till, wrapped in flames, the mighty hayrick burns"
2338,_THE TEAMSTER._,"And sends its sparks on to a neighbouring byre,"
2339,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Where, frightened at the hot, tremendous glow,"
2340,_THE TEAMSTER._,The cattle low.
2341,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2342,_THE TEAMSTER._,"And rick on rick takes fire; and next a stye,"
2343,_THE TEAMSTER._,Whence through the smoke the little pigs rush out;
2344,_THE TEAMSTER._,"The house-dog barks; then, with a startled cry,"
2345,_THE TEAMSTER._,"The window is flung open, shout on shout"
2346,_THE TEAMSTER._,Wakes the hard-sleeping farm where man and maid
2347,_THE TEAMSTER._,Start up dismayed.
2348,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2349,_THE TEAMSTER._,"And with wild faces wavering in the glare,"
2350,_THE TEAMSTER._,"In nightcaps, bedgowns, clothes half huddled on"
2351,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Some to the pump, some to the duck-pond tear"
2352,_THE TEAMSTER._,"In frantic haste, while others splashing run"
2353,_THE TEAMSTER._,"With pails, or turn the hose with flame-scorched face"
2354,_THE TEAMSTER._,Upon the blaze.
2355,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2356,_THE TEAMSTER._,"At last, when some wan streaks began to show"
2357,_THE TEAMSTER._,"In the chill darkness of the sky, the fire"
2358,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Went out, subdued but for the sputtering glow"
2359,_THE TEAMSTER._,Of sparks among wet ashes. Barn and byre
2360,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Were safe, but swallowed all the summer math"
2361,_THE TEAMSTER._,By fire of wrath.
2362,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2363,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Still haggard from the night's wild work and pale,"
2364,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Farm-men and women stood in whispering knots,"
2365,_THE TEAMSTER._,Regaled with foaming mugs of nut-brown ale;
2366,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Firing his oaths about like vicious shots,"
2367,_THE TEAMSTER._,"The farmer hissed out now and then: ""Gad damn!"
2368,_THE TEAMSTER._,"It's that black Sam."""
2369,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2370,_THE TEAMSTER._,They had him up and taxed him with the crime;
2371,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Denying naught, he sulked and held his peace;"
2372,_THE TEAMSTER._,"And so, a branded convict, in due time,"
2373,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Handcuffed and cropped, they shipped him over-seas:"
2374,_THE TEAMSTER._,Seven years of shame sliced from his labourer's life
2375,_THE TEAMSTER._,As with a knife.
2376,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2377,_THE TEAMSTER._,But through it all the image of a girl
2378,_THE TEAMSTER._,"With hazel eyes like pebbled waters clear,"
2379,_THE TEAMSTER._,"And warm brown hair that wantoned into curl,"
2380,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Kept his heart sweet through many a galling year,"
2381,_THE TEAMSTER._,Like to a bit of lavender long pressed
2382,_THE TEAMSTER._,In some black chest.
2383,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2384,_THE TEAMSTER._,"At last his time was up, and Sam returned"
2385,_THE TEAMSTER._,"To his dear village with its single street,"
2386,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Where, in the sooty forge, the fire still burned,"
2387,_THE TEAMSTER._,"As, hammering on the anvil, red with heat,"
2388,_THE TEAMSTER._,"The smith wrought at a shoe with tongues aglow,"
2389,_THE TEAMSTER._,Blow upon blow.
2390,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2391,_THE TEAMSTER._,"There stood the church, with peals for death and birth,"
2392,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Its ancient spire o'ertopping ancient trees,"
2393,_THE TEAMSTER._,"And there the graves and mounds of unknown earth,"
2394,_THE TEAMSTER._,Gathered like little children round its knees;
2395,_THE TEAMSTER._,"There was ""The Bull,"" with sign above the door,"
2396,_THE TEAMSTER._,And sanded floor.
2397,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2398,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Unrecognized Sam took his glass of beer,"
2399,_THE TEAMSTER._,And picked up gossip which the men let fall:
2400,_THE TEAMSTER._,"How Farmer Clow had failed, and one named Steer"
2401,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Had taken on the land, repairs and all;"
2402,_THE TEAMSTER._,And how the Kimber girl was to be wed
2403,_THE TEAMSTER._,To Betsy's Ned.
2404,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2405,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Sam heard no more, flung down his pence, and took"
2406,_THE TEAMSTER._,The way down to the well-remembered stile;
2407,_THE TEAMSTER._,"There, in the gloaming by the trysting brook,"
2408,_THE TEAMSTER._,He came upon his May--with just that smile
2409,_THE TEAMSTER._,"For sheep-faced Ned, that light in happy eyes:"
2410,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Oh, sugared lies!"
2411,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2412,_THE TEAMSTER._,He came upon them with black-knitted brows
2413,_THE TEAMSTER._,"And clenched brown hands, and muttered huskily:"
2414,_THE TEAMSTER._,"""Oh, little May, are those your true love's vows"
2415,_THE TEAMSTER._,"You swore to keep while I was over-sea?"""
2416,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Then crying, turned upon the other one,"
2417,_THE TEAMSTER._,"""Com on, com on."""
2418,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2419,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Then they fell to with faces set for fight,"
2420,_THE TEAMSTER._,And hit each other hard with rustic pride;
2421,_THE TEAMSTER._,"But Sam, whose arm with iron force could smite,"
2422,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Knocked his cowed rival down, and won his bride."
2423,_THE TEAMSTER._,"May wept and smiled, swayed like a wild red rose"
2424,_THE TEAMSTER._,As the wind blows.
2425,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2426,_THE TEAMSTER._,"She married Sam, who loved her with a wild"
2427,_THE TEAMSTER._,Strong love he could not put to words--too deep
2428,_THE TEAMSTER._,For her to gauge; but with her first-born child
2429,_THE TEAMSTER._,"May dropped off, flower-like, into the long sleep,"
2430,_THE TEAMSTER._,And left him nothing but the memory of
2431,_THE TEAMSTER._,His little love.
2432,_THE TEAMSTER._,
2433,_THE TEAMSTER._,"Since then the silent teamster lives alone,"
2434,_THE TEAMSTER._,The trusted headman of his master Steer;
2435,_THE TEAMSTER._,One only passion seems he still to own--
2436,_THE TEAMSTER._,The passion for the foals he has to rear;
2437,_THE TEAMSTER._,"And still the prettiest, full of life and play,"
2438,_THE TEAMSTER._,Is little May.

3012,X.,Lent to the earth heaven's native hue
3013,X.,Of holy blue.
3014,X.,
3015,X.,I sought that plot of azure light
3016,X.,Once more in gloomy hours;
3017,X.,But snow had fallen overnight
3018,X.,And wrapped in mortuary white
3019,X.,My fairy ring of flowers.
3020,X.,
3021,XI.,XI.
3022,XI.,
3023,XI.,"Ah, yesterday was dark and drear,"
3024,XI.,My heart was deadly sore;
3025,XI.,"Without thy love it seemed, my Dear,"
3026,XI.,That I could live no more.
3027,XI.,
3028,XI.,And yet I laugh and sing to-day;
3029,XI.,"Care or care not for me,"
3030,XI.,Thou canst not take the love away
3031,XI.,With which I worship thee.
3032,XI.,
3033,XI.,"And if to-morrow, Dear, I live,"
3034,XI.,My heart I shall not break:
3035,XI.,For still I hold it that to give

3039,XII.,
3040,XII.,"Yea, the roses are still on fire"

3043,XII.,"Shake a rose-leaf or two from the brier,"
3044,XII.,Be it never so soft a sigh.
3045,XII.,
3046,XII.,Ember of love still glows and lingers
3047,XII.,Deep at the red heart's smouldering core;
3048,XII.,With the sudden passionate throb of yore
3049,XII.,We shook as our eyes and clinging fingers
3050,XII.,Met once only to meet no more.
3051,XII.,
3052,XIII.,XIII.
3053,XIII.,
3054,XIII.,"We met as strangers on life's lonely way,"
3055,XIII.,And yet it seemed we knew each other well;
3056,XIII.,"There was no end to what thou hadst to say,"
3057,XIII.,Or to the thousand things I found to tell.
3058,XIII.,"My heart, long silent, at thy voice that day"
3059,XIII.,Chimed in my breast like to a silver bell.
3060,XIII.,
3061,XIII.,"How much we spoke, and yet still left untold"
3062,XIII.,Some secret half revealed within our eyes:
3063,XIII.,Didst thou not love me once in ages old?
3064,XIII.,"Had I not called thee with importunate cries,"
3065,XIII.,"And, like a child left sobbing in the cold,"
3066,XIII.,Listened to catch from far thy fond replies?
3067,XIII.,
3068,XIII.,"We met as strangers, and as such we part;"
3069,XIII.,Yet all my life seems leaving me with thine;
3070,XIII.,"Ah, to be clasped once only heart to heart,"
3071,XIII.,If only once to feel that thou wert mine!
3072,XIII.,"These lips are locked, and yet I know thou art"
3073,XIII.,That all in all for which my soul did pine.
3074,XIII.,
3075,XIV.,XIV.
3076,XIV.,
3077,XIV.,You make the sunshine of my heart
3078,XIV.,And its tempestuous shower;
3079,XIV.,Sometimes the thought of you is like
3080,XIV.,"A lilac bush in flower,"
3081,XIV.,"Yea, honey-sweet as hives in May."
3082,XIV.,And then the pang of it will strike
3083,XIV.,"My bosom with a fiery smart,"
3084,XIV.,As though love's deeply planted dart
3085,XIV.,Drained all its life away.
3086,XIV.,
3087,XIV.,"My thoughts hum round you, Dear, like bees"
3088,XIV.,"About a bank of thyme,"
3089,XIV.,Or round the yellow blossoms of
3090,XIV.,The heavy-scented lime.
3091,XIV.,"Ah, sweeter you than honeydew,"
3092,XIV.,"Yet dark the ways of love,"
3093,XIV.,"For it has robbed my soul of peace,"
3094,XIV.,And marred my life and turned heart's-ease
3095,XIV.,Into funereal rue.
3096,XIV.,
3097,XV.,XV.
3098,XV.,
3099,XV.,"Dear, when I look into your eyes"
3100,XV.,"My hurts are healed, my heart grows whole;"
3101,XV.,"The barren places in my soul,"
3102,XV.,"Like waste lands under April skies,"
3103,XV.,Break into flower beneath your eyes.
3104,XV.,
3105,XV.,"Ah, life grows lovely where you are;"
3106,XV.,Only to think of you gives light
3107,XV.,"To my dark heart, within whose night"
3108,XV.,"Your image, though you bide afar,"
3109,XV.,Glows like a lake-reflected star.
3110,XV.,
3111,XV.,Dare I crave more than only this:
3112,XV.,"A thrill of love, a transient smile"
3113,XV.,To gladden all my world awhile?
3114,XV.,"No more, alas! Is mortal bliss"
3115,XV.,Not transient as a lover's kiss?
3116,XV.,
3117,XVI.,XVI.
3118,XVI.,
3119,XVI.,"Ah, if you knew how soon and late"
3120,XVI.,"My eyes long for a sight of you,"
3121,XVI.,Sometimes in passing by my gate
3122,XVI.,"You'd linger until fall of dew,"
3123,XVI.,If you but knew!
3124,XVI.,
3125,XVI.,"Ah, if you knew how sick and sore"
3126,XVI.,"My life flags for the want of you,"
3127,XVI.,Straightway you'd enter at the door
3128,XVI.,"And clasp my hand between your two,"
3129,XVI.,If you but knew!
3130,XVI.,
3131,XVI.,"Ah, if you knew how lost and lone"
3132,XVI.,"I watch and weep and wait for you,"
3133,XVI.,You'd press my heart close to your own
3134,XVI.,"Till love had healed me through and through,"
3135,XVI.,If you but knew!
3136,XVI.,
3137,XVII.,XVII.
3138,XVII.,
3139,XVII.,Your looks have touched my soul with bright
3140,XVII.,Ineffable emotion;
3141,XVII.,As moonbeams on a stormy night
3142,XVII.,Illume with transitory light
3143,XVII.,A seagull on her lonely flight
3144,XVII.,Across the lonely ocean.
3145,XVII.,
3146,XVII.,"Fluttering from out the gloom and roar,"
3147,XVII.,"On fitful wing she flies,"
3148,XVII.,Moon-white above the moon-washed shore;
3149,XVII.,"Then, drowned in darkness as before,"

3167,XVIII.,"All my soul, with yearning shaken,"

3169,XVIII.,"Who will see your heart awaken,"

3175,XIX.,"Once on a golden day,"

3179,XIX.,
3180,XIX.,"I culled my heart in truth,"
3181,XIX.,"Wet with the dews of youth,"
3182,XIX.,"For love to take, forsooth--"
3183,XIX.,Little flowers were springing.
3184,XIX.,
3185,XIX.,"Love sweetly laughed at this,"

3187,XIX.,Fled with my heart in his:

3189,XIX.,
3190,XIX.,And with his sun and shower
3191,XIX.,"Love kept my heart in flower,"

3194,XIX.,
3195,XIX.,"Till, worn at evensong,"

3198,XIX.,Misprizèd token.
3199,XIX.,
3200,XIX.,"There in the wind and rain,"

3399,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,","""There is perhaps no phase of our history more capable of poetic"
3400,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,",treatment than the sainted lives of the Irish monks who first spread
3401,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,","the Christian faith over the western shores of Scotland, and yet it"
3402,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,",would be difficult to point to a single representative poem having
3403,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,",Saint Columba and the devoted band of his disciples for its heroes. An
3404,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,",attempt at filling up this gap has recently been made by Miss Blind in
3405,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,","a narrative poem devoted to the fate of St. Oran, the friend and"
3406,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,",disciple of St. Columba.... Apart from the sonorous beauty of her
3407,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,","lines, there is in her diction a straightforwardness and simplicity,"
3408,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,","and an entire absence of affectation and false sentiment, which,"
3409,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,","combined with considerable power of characterization, make her volume"

3412,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,",
3413,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,","""To disturb the _motif_ of a legend is always a bold, and mostly a"
3414,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,","rash, proceeding.... And yet so skilfully is the story handled that"
3415,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,","the main incidents of the legend do not lose, but gain by this"
3416,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,","disturbance of the _motif_, and the character of Oran, which with the"
3417,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,",old _motif_ could only have presented the single side of the religious
3418,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,","enthusiast, becomes a character exhibiting that complexity which"
3419,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,",modern taste demands.... Directness of style and lucidity of narrative
3420,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,",are the characteristic excellences of the poem. There are few
3421,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,",contemporary poets who could have done so much dramatic business in so

3425,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,","""It is in the domain of character that the poem is distinguished by"
3426,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,",its highest excellence. There is an ideal statuesqueness embodied in
3427,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,",the person of St. Columba such as is felt to possess a powerful appeal
3428,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,","to the imagination. The poem embraces many passions, of which the most"
3429,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,",tender and beautiful finds expression in the exquisite creation of the
3430,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,",radiant golden-haired girl for whose love St. Oran breaks his vow of
3431,"THE PROPHECY OF SAINT ORAN,",chastity. But the really powerful contribution to our knowledge of
