MARY LESLIE


_Before Vittoria, June_ 20, 1813


O Mary Leslie, blithe and shrill
  The bugles blew for Spain:
And you below the Castle Hill
  Stood in the crowd your lane.
Then hearts were wild to watch us pass,
  Yet laith to let us go!
While mine said, "Fare-ye-well, my lass!"
  And yours, "God keep my Jo!"

Here by the bivouac fire, above
  These fields of savage play,
I'll lift my love to meet thy love
  Twa thousand miles away,

Where yonder, yonder by the stars,
  Nightlong there rins a burn,
And maids with lovers at the wars
  May list their wraiths' return.

More careless yet my spirit grows
  Of fame, more sick of blood:
But I can think of Badajoz,
  And yet that God is good.
Beyond the siege, beyond the stour,
  Beyond the sack of towns,
I reach to pluck ae lily-floo'r
  Where leaders press for crowns.

O Mary! lily! bow'd and wet
  With mair than mornin's rain!
The bugles up the Lawnmarket
  Shall sound us home again.

Then fare-ye-well, these foreign lands,
  And be damn'd their bitter drouth.
With your dear face between my hands
  And the cup held to my mouth,
                           My love,
It's clean cup to my mouth!




JENIFER'S LOVE


Small is my secret--let it pass--
  Small in your life the share I had,
Who sat beside you in the class,
  Awed by the bright superior lad:
    Whom yet with hot and eager face
    I prompted when he missed his place.

For you the call came swift and soon:
  But sometimes in your holidays
You meet me trudging home at noon
  To dinner through the dusty ways,
    And recognized, and with a nod
    Passed on, but never guessed--thank God!

Truly our ways were separate.
  I bent myself to hoe and drill,

Yea, with an honest man to mate,
  Fulfilling God Almighty's will;
    And bore him children. But my prayers
    Were yours--and, only after, theirs.

While you--still loftier, more remote,
  You sprang from stair to stair of fame,
And you've a riband on your coat,
  And you've a title to your name;
    But have you yet a star to shine
    Above your bed, as I o'er mine?
