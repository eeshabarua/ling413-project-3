51,M.DCCC.XLV.,
52,M.DCCC.XLV.,_The student of our early literature and language is indebted to the
53,M.DCCC.XLV.,"zeal of Sir Thomas Phillipps, for the discovery of the following"
54,M.DCCC.XLV.,"interesting Fragment, which appears to have formed part of a volume that"
55,M.DCCC.XLV.,"contained Ælfric's Grammar and Glossary, probably of the Twelfth"
56,M.DCCC.XLV.,Century. The fragments were discovered among the archives of Worcester
57,M.DCCC.XLV.,Cathedral; and in 1836 Sir Thomas Phillipps printed the whole of them in
58,M.DCCC.XLV.,folio. I know not whether the form or the typographical arrangement has
59,M.DCCC.XLV.,been the cause of the neglect of this publication; but it has escaped
60,M.DCCC.XLV.,"both Mr. Wright and Mr. Thorpe. The former, in his interesting edition"
61,M.DCCC.XLV.,"of ""The Latin Poems of Walter de Mapes,"" where he has given the literary"
62,M.DCCC.XLV.,"history of this legend with extracts, has not even referred to our"
63,M.DCCC.XLV.,fragment; nor has Mr. Thorpe adverted to it in his publication of the
64,M.DCCC.XLV.,"""Codex Exoniensis,"" which contains an Anglo-Saxon poem of the same kind,"
65,M.DCCC.XLV.,with which it is interesting to compare this later version of the
66,M.DCCC.XLV.,"legend. There is a portion of another semi-Saxon poem, entitled ""The"
67,M.DCCC.XLV.,"Grave,"" printed in Mr. Conybeare's ""Illustrations,"" and by Mr. Thorpe in"
68,M.DCCC.XLV.,"his ""Analecta Anglo-Saxonica,"" which appears to be by the same hand, or"
69,M.DCCC.XLV.,at any rate of the same school and age. Indeed some of the lines and
70,M.DCCC.XLV.,thoughts are identical with passages of the following poem. Mr. Thorpe
71,M.DCCC.XLV.,"has justly called ""The Grave"" a singularly impressive and almost"
72,M.DCCC.XLV.,appalling fragment; expressions equally characteristic of that with
73,M.DCCC.XLV.,which the reader is here presented._
74,M.DCCC.XLV.,
75,M.DCCC.XLV.,"_This impressive character, coupled with the interest which the fragment"
76,M.DCCC.XLV.,"possesses, as a specimen of the moral poetry of our ancestors, and as"
77,M.DCCC.XLV.,throwing light upon the transition of our language from Saxon to
78,M.DCCC.XLV.,"English, has been the motive for producing it in a more legible form"
79,M.DCCC.XLV.,than that in which it first appeared._
80,M.DCCC.XLV.,
81,M.DCCC.XLV.,"_In one of the smaller poems (No. V.), printed by Mr. Wright with the"
82,M.DCCC.XLV.,"Owl and the Nightingale, from the Cottonian MS. Calig. A. ix. ""The sorie"
83,M.DCCC.XLV.,"sowle maketh hire mone,"" in language not dissimilar to that used in the"
84,M.DCCC.XLV.,following fragment; and the dreary imagery of the house appointed for
85,M.DCCC.XLV.,"all living, and the punishment which awaits a wicked life at its close,"
86,M.DCCC.XLV.,are painted in an equally fearful manner._
87,M.DCCC.XLV.,
88,M.DCCC.XLV.,_Mr. Thorpe points to an Anglo-Saxon prose Homily as the original of the
89,M.DCCC.XLV.,"poem on the same theme in the Exeter MS., which is repeated, with some"
90,M.DCCC.XLV.,"variation, in the Vercelli Codex. In a rude and simple age this dramatic"
91,M.DCCC.XLV.,"way of awakening the sinner to a sense of his perilous state, was"
92,M.DCCC.XLV.,"perhaps the most effective that could have been chosen, and it was"
93,M.DCCC.XLV.,naturally a favorite with the moral and religious teachers for some
94,M.DCCC.XLV.,"centuries. M. Karajan, in a very pleasing little publication"
95,M.DCCC.XLV.,"(Frülingsgabe für freunde Alterer Literatur, Wien 1839) has printed the"
96,M.DCCC.XLV.,"""Visio Philiberti,"" a Latin poem in dialogue on this subject, with two"
97,M.DCCC.XLV.,old German versions; and the notes contain some interesting information
98,M.DCCC.XLV.,"relating to similar compositions; but Mr. Wright's volume, before"
99,M.DCCC.XLV.,"referred to, contains ample illustrations of the legend in all"
100,M.DCCC.XLV.,languages._
101,M.DCCC.XLV.,
102,M.DCCC.XLV.,"_The fragment here given, it will be seen, is very defective. An attempt"
103,M.DCCC.XLV.,"has been made to supply words which were wanting, from the mutilation of"
104,M.DCCC.XLV.,the MS. leaves; but what is engrafted on the original is scrupulously
105,M.DCCC.XLV.,"distinguished by the Italic character. A version has also been added,"
106,M.DCCC.XLV.,the imperfections of which those who are acquainted with the
107,M.DCCC.XLV.,difficulties of such renderings will best know how to excuse._
108,M.DCCC.XLV.,
109,M.DCCC.XLV.,_The language of this poem seems to have a striking resemblance to that
110,M.DCCC.XLV.,"of one of the MSS. of La[gh]amon, and we may hope, when the lovers of"
111,M.DCCC.XLV.,our early lore shall be favoured with the long and anxiously expected
112,M.DCCC.XLV.,"edition of that work by Sir Frederick Madden, that much light will be"
113,M.DCCC.XLV.,thrown upon the history of the transitions of our language._
114,M.DCCC.XLV.,
115,M.DCCC.XLV.,"_For what has been already done by Conybeare, Price, Kemble, Thorpe,"
116,M.DCCC.XLV.,"Madden, Stevenson, Wright, Way and others, the present writer is most"
117,M.DCCC.XLV.,"grateful; but he would wish to see the same spirit and enthusiasm, the"
118,M.DCCC.XLV.,same unwearied zeal displayed in the elucidation of the noble remains of
119,M.DCCC.XLV.,"our Anglo-Saxon ancestors, and of the interesting stores of our early"
120,M.DCCC.XLV.,"literature and language, which has been so long a distinguishing feature"
121,M.DCCC.XLV.,"of Germany, whose example has of late years lighted up a similar"
122,M.DCCC.XLV.,patriotic flame in France and Belgium._
