121,TEASE,"You shall be my châtelaine,"
122,TEASE,"You shall enter as you please,"
123,TEASE,As you please shall go again.
124,TEASE,
125,TEASE,When I hear you jingling through
126,TEASE,"All the chambers of my soul,"
127,TEASE,How I sit and laugh at you
128,TEASE,In your vain housekeeping rôle.
129,TEASE,
130,TEASE,"Jealous of the smallest cover,"
131,TEASE,Angry at the simplest door;
132,TEASE,"Well, you anxious, inquisitive lover,"
133,TEASE,Are you pleased with what's in store?
134,TEASE,
135,TEASE,"You have fingered all my treasures,"
136,TEASE,"Have you not, most curiously,"
137,TEASE,Handled all my tools and measures
138,TEASE,And masculine machinery?
139,TEASE,
140,TEASE,Over every single beauty
141,TEASE,You have had your little rapture;
142,TEASE,"You have slain, as was your duty,"
143,TEASE,Every sin-mouse you could capture.
144,TEASE,
145,TEASE,"Still you are not satisfied,"
146,TEASE,Still you tremble faint reproach;
147,TEASE,Challenge me I keep aside
148,TEASE,Secrets that you may not broach.
149,TEASE,
150,TEASE,"Maybe yes, and maybe no,"
151,TEASE,"Maybe there _are_ secret places,"
152,TEASE,"Altars barbarous below,"
153,TEASE,Elsewhere halls of high disgraces.
154,TEASE,
155,TEASE,"Maybe yes, and maybe no,"
156,TEASE,"You may have it as you please,"
157,TEASE,"Since I choose to keep you so,"
158,TEASE,Suppliant on your curious knees.

162,THE WILD COMMON,
163,THE WILD COMMON,"THE quick sparks on the gorse bushes are leaping,"
164,THE WILD COMMON,Little jets of sunlight-texture imitating flame;
165,THE WILD COMMON,"Above them, exultant, the pee-wits are sweeping:"
166,THE WILD COMMON,They are lords of the desolate wastes of sadness
167,THE WILD COMMON,their screamings proclaim.
168,THE WILD COMMON,
169,THE WILD COMMON,"Rabbits, handfuls of brown earth, lie"
170,THE WILD COMMON,Low-rounded on the mournful grass they have bitten
171,THE WILD COMMON,down to the quick.
172,THE WILD COMMON,"Are they asleep?--Are they alive?--Now see,"
173,THE WILD COMMON,when I
174,THE WILD COMMON,Move my arms the hill bursts and heaves under their
175,THE WILD COMMON,spurting kick.
176,THE WILD COMMON,
177,THE WILD COMMON,"The common flaunts bravely; but below, from the"
178,THE WILD COMMON,rushes
179,THE WILD COMMON,Crowds of glittering king-cups surge to challenge the
180,THE WILD COMMON,blossoming bushes;
181,THE WILD COMMON,There the lazy streamlet pushes
182,THE WILD COMMON,"Its curious course mildly; here it wakes again, leaps,"
183,THE WILD COMMON,"laughs, and gushes."
184,THE WILD COMMON,
185,THE WILD COMMON,"Into a deep pond, an old sheep-dip,"
186,THE WILD COMMON,"Dark, overgrown with willows, cool, with the brook"
187,THE WILD COMMON,"ebbing through so slow,"
188,THE WILD COMMON,"Naked on the steep, soft lip"
189,THE WILD COMMON,Of the bank I stand watching my own white shadow
190,THE WILD COMMON,quivering to and fro.
191,THE WILD COMMON,
192,THE WILD COMMON,What if the gorse flowers shrivelled and kissing were
193,THE WILD COMMON,lost?
194,THE WILD COMMON,"Without the pulsing waters, where were the marigolds"
195,THE WILD COMMON,and the songs of the brook?
196,THE WILD COMMON,If my veins and my breasts with love embossed
197,THE WILD COMMON,"Withered, my insolent soul would be gone like flowers"
198,THE WILD COMMON,that the hot wind took.
199,THE WILD COMMON,
200,THE WILD COMMON,"So my soul like a passionate woman turns,"
201,THE WILD COMMON,"Filled with remorseful terror to the man she scorned,"
202,THE WILD COMMON,and her love
203,THE WILD COMMON,"For myself in my own eyes' laughter burns,"
204,THE WILD COMMON,Runs ecstatic over the pliant folds rippling down to
205,THE WILD COMMON,my belly from the breast-lights above.
206,THE WILD COMMON,
207,THE WILD COMMON,"Over my sunlit skin the warm, clinging air,"
208,THE WILD COMMON,"Rich with the songs of seven larks singing at once,"
209,THE WILD COMMON,goes kissing me glad.
210,THE WILD COMMON,And the soul of the wind and my blood compare
211,THE WILD COMMON,"Their wandering happiness, and the wind, wasted in"
212,THE WILD COMMON,"liberty, drifts on and is sad."
213,THE WILD COMMON,
214,THE WILD COMMON,"Oh but the water loves me and folds me,"
215,THE WILD COMMON,"Plays with me, sways me, lifts me and sinks me as"
216,THE WILD COMMON,"though it were living blood,"
217,THE WILD COMMON,"Blood of a heaving woman who holds me,"
218,THE WILD COMMON,"Owning my supple body a rare glad thing, supremely"
219,THE WILD COMMON,good.

224,STUDY,SOMEWHERE the long mellow note of the blackbird
225,STUDY,"Quickens the unclasping hands of hazel,"
226,STUDY,"Somewhere the wind-flowers fling their heads back,"
227,STUDY,Stirred by an impetuous wind. Some ways'll
228,STUDY,All be sweet with white and blue violet.
229,STUDY,"(_Hush now, hush. Where am I?--Biuret--_)"
230,STUDY,
231,STUDY,On the green wood's edge a shy girl hovers
232,STUDY,"From out of the hazel-screen on to the grass,"
233,STUDY,Where wheeling and screaming the petulant plovers
234,STUDY,"Wave frighted. Who comes? A labourer, alas!"
235,STUDY,Oh the sunset swims in her eyes' swift pool.
236,STUDY,"(_Work, work, you fool--!_)"
237,STUDY,
238,STUDY,Somewhere the lamp hanging low from the ceiling
239,STUDY,"Lights the soft hair of a girl as she reads,"
240,STUDY,And the red firelight steadily wheeling
241,STUDY,Weaves the hard hands of my friend in sleep.
242,STUDY,"And the white dog snuffs the warmth, appealing"
243,STUDY,For the man to heed lest the girl shall weep.
244,STUDY,
245,STUDY,(_Tears and dreams for them; for me
246,STUDY,Bitter science--the exams. are near.
247,STUDY,I wish I bore it more patiently.
248,STUDY,"I wish you did not wait, my dear,"
249,STUDY,For me to come: since work I must:
250,STUDY,Though it's all the same when we are dead.--
251,STUDY,"I wish I was only a bust,"
252,STUDY,All head._)

257,DISCORD IN CHILDHOOD,OUTSIDE the house an ash-tree hung its terrible
258,DISCORD IN CHILDHOOD,"whips,"
259,DISCORD IN CHILDHOOD,"And at night when the wind arose, the lash of the tree"
260,DISCORD IN CHILDHOOD,"Shrieked and slashed the wind, as a ship's"
261,DISCORD IN CHILDHOOD,Weird rigging in a storm shrieks hideously.
262,DISCORD IN CHILDHOOD,
263,DISCORD IN CHILDHOOD,"Within the house two voices arose in anger, a slender"
264,DISCORD IN CHILDHOOD,lash
265,DISCORD IN CHILDHOOD,"Whistling delirious rage, and the dreadful sound"
266,DISCORD IN CHILDHOOD,"Of a thick lash booming and bruising, until it"
267,DISCORD IN CHILDHOOD,drowned
268,DISCORD IN CHILDHOOD,"The other voice in a silence of blood, 'neath the noise"
269,DISCORD IN CHILDHOOD,of the ash.

277,VIRGIN YOUTH,"That quivers between my eyes and mouth,"
278,VIRGIN YOUTH,"Flies like a wild thing across my body,"
279,VIRGIN YOUTH,"Leaving my eyes half-empty, and clamorous,"
280,VIRGIN YOUTH,"Filling my still breasts with a flush and a flame,"
281,VIRGIN YOUTH,Gathering the soft ripples below my breasts
282,VIRGIN YOUTH,"Into urgent, passionate waves,"
283,VIRGIN YOUTH,"And my soft, slumbering belly"
284,VIRGIN YOUTH,"Quivering awake with one impulse of desire,"
285,VIRGIN YOUTH,Gathers itself fiercely together;
286,VIRGIN YOUTH,"And my docile, fluent arms"
287,VIRGIN YOUTH,Knotting themselves with wild strength
288,VIRGIN YOUTH,To clasp what they have never clasped.
289,VIRGIN YOUTH,"Then I tremble, and go trembling"
290,VIRGIN YOUTH,"Under the wild, strange tyranny of my body,"
291,VIRGIN YOUTH,"Till it has spent itself,"
292,VIRGIN YOUTH,"And the relentless nodality of my eyes reasserts itself,"
293,VIRGIN YOUTH,"Till the bursten flood of life ebbs back to my eyes,"
294,VIRGIN YOUTH,"Back from my beautiful, lonely body"
295,VIRGIN YOUTH,Tired and unsatisfied.

333,MONOLOGUE OF A MOTHER,"In my soul from under the sudden frown of his brow,"

403,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,"They know, but clamorously falling"
404,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,"Into gabbling incoherence, never resting,"
405,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,Like spattering showers from a bursten sky-rocket
406,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,dropping
407,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,"In splashes of sound, endlessly, never stopping."
408,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,
409,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,The silver moon
410,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,That somebody has spun so high
411,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,"To settle the question, yes or no, has caught"
412,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,"In the net of the night's balloon,"
413,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,And sits with a smooth bland smile up there in
414,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,the sky
415,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,"Smiling at naught,"
416,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,Unless the winking star that keeps her company
417,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,"Makes little jests at the bells' insanity,"

419,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,
420,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,The patient Night
421,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,"Sits indifferent, hugged in her rags,"

426,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,"face,"
427,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,"Smiling, perhaps, if we knew it, at the bells' loud"
428,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,clattering disgrace.
429,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,
430,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,The wise old trees
431,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,"Drop their leaves with a faint, sharp hiss of contempt,"
432,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,While a car at the end of the street goes by with a
433,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,laugh;
434,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,As by degrees
435,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,"The poor bells cease, and the Night is exempt,"
436,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,And the stars can chaff
437,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,"The ironic moon at their ease, while the dim old"
438,WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE,church

454,IRONY,waiting
455,IRONY,"In a little throng at your door, and admit the one"
456,IRONY,who is plaiting
457,IRONY,"Her hair for womanhood, and play awhile with her,"
458,IRONY,then bid her depart.
459,IRONY,
460,IRONY,A come and go of March-day loves
461,IRONY,"Through the flower-vine, trailing screen;"
462,IRONY,A fluttering in of doves.
463,IRONY,Then a launch abroad of shrinking doves
464,IRONY,Over the waste where no hope is seen
465,IRONY,Of open hands:
466,IRONY,Dance in and out
467,IRONY,"Small-bosomed girls of the spring of love,"
468,IRONY,"With a bubble of laughter, and shrilly shout"
469,IRONY,Of mirth; then the dripping of tears on your

1377,THE INHERITANCE,But I scarcely feel your loss.
1378,THE INHERITANCE,You left me a gift
1379,THE INHERITANCE,"Of tongues, so the shadows tell"
1380,THE INHERITANCE,"Me things, and silences toss"
1381,THE INHERITANCE,Me their drift.
1382,THE INHERITANCE,
1383,THE INHERITANCE,You sent me a cloven fire
1384,THE INHERITANCE,"Out of death, and it burns in the draught"
1385,THE INHERITANCE,"Of the breathing hosts,"
1386,THE INHERITANCE,Kindles the darkening pyre
1387,THE INHERITANCE,"For the sorrowful, till strange brands waft"
1388,THE INHERITANCE,Like candid ghosts.
1389,THE INHERITANCE,
1390,THE INHERITANCE,"Form after form, in the streets"
1391,THE INHERITANCE,"Waves like a ghost along,"
1392,THE INHERITANCE,Kindled to me;
1393,THE INHERITANCE,The star above the house-top greets
1394,THE INHERITANCE,Me every eve with a long
1395,THE INHERITANCE,Song fierily.
1396,THE INHERITANCE,
1397,THE INHERITANCE,"All day long, the town"
1398,THE INHERITANCE,Glimmers with subtle ghosts
1399,THE INHERITANCE,Going up and down
1400,THE INHERITANCE,"In a common, prison-like dress;"
1401,THE INHERITANCE,But their daunted looking flickers
1402,THE INHERITANCE,"To me, and I answer, Yes!"
1403,THE INHERITANCE,
1404,THE INHERITANCE,So I am not lonely nor sad
1405,THE INHERITANCE,"Although bereaved of you,"
1406,THE INHERITANCE,My little love.
1407,THE INHERITANCE,I move among a kinsfolk clad
1408,THE INHERITANCE,"With words, but the dream shows through"
1409,THE INHERITANCE,As they move.

1416,SILENCE,"A moment, then in weariness settle"
1417,SILENCE,On the flood that soundless swings.
1418,SILENCE,
1419,SILENCE,Whether the people in the street
1420,SILENCE,"Like pattering ripples go by,"
1421,SILENCE,Or whether the theatre sighs and sighs
1422,SILENCE,"With a loud, hoarse sigh:"
1423,SILENCE,
1424,SILENCE,Or the wind shakes a ravel of light
1425,SILENCE,"Over the dead-black river,"
1426,SILENCE,Or night's last echoing
1427,SILENCE,Makes the daybreak shiver:
1428,SILENCE,
1429,SILENCE,I feel the silence waiting
1430,SILENCE,To take them all up again
1431,SILENCE,"In its vast completeness, enfolding"

1439,LISTENING,"I feel your silence touch my words as I talk,"
1440,LISTENING,And take them in thrall.
1441,LISTENING,
1442,LISTENING,My words fly off a forge
1443,LISTENING,The length of a spark;
1444,LISTENING,I see the night-sky easily sip them
1445,LISTENING,Up in the dark.
1446,LISTENING,
1447,LISTENING,"The lark sings loud and glad,"
1448,LISTENING,Yet I am not loth
1449,LISTENING,That silence should take the song and the bird
1450,LISTENING,And lose them both.
1451,LISTENING,
1452,LISTENING,"A train goes roaring south,"
1453,LISTENING,The steam-flag flying;
1454,LISTENING,I see the stealthy shadow of silence
1455,LISTENING,Alongside going.
1456,LISTENING,
1457,LISTENING,"And off the forge of the world,"
1458,LISTENING,"Whirling in the draught of life,"
1459,LISTENING,"Go sparks of myriad people, filling"
1460,LISTENING,The night with strife.
1461,LISTENING,
1462,LISTENING,Yet they never change the darkness
1463,LISTENING,Or blench it with noise;
1464,LISTENING,Alone on the perfect silence
1465,LISTENING,The stars are buoys.

1472,BROODING GRIEF,Why should I start and stand still?
1473,BROODING GRIEF,
1474,BROODING GRIEF,I was watching the woman that bore me
1475,BROODING GRIEF,Stretched in the brindled darkness
1476,BROODING GRIEF,"Of the sick-room, rigid with will"
1477,BROODING GRIEF,To die: and the quick leaf tore me

1493,LOTUS HURT BY THE COLD,
1494,LOTUS HURT BY THE COLD,And then I offer all myself unto
1495,LOTUS HURT BY THE COLD,This woman who likes to love me: but she turns
1496,LOTUS HURT BY THE COLD,A look of hate upon the flower that burns

1498,LOTUS HURT BY THE COLD,

1792,EXCURSION,"Pours on us, lift your fingers white"
1793,EXCURSION,"And strip me naked, touch me light,"
1794,EXCURSION,"Light, light all over."
1795,EXCURSION,"For I ache most earnestly for your touch,"
1796,EXCURSION,"Yet I cannot move, however much"
1797,EXCURSION,I would be your lover.
1798,EXCURSION,
1799,EXCURSION,Night after night with a blemish of day
1800,EXCURSION,Unblown and unblossomed has withered away;
1801,EXCURSION,"Come another night, come a new night, say"
1802,EXCURSION,Will you pluck me apart?
1803,EXCURSION,"Will you open the amorous, aching bud"
1804,EXCURSION,"Of my body, and loose the burning flood"
1805,EXCURSION,That would leap to you from my heart?

1809,PERFIDY,
1810,PERFIDY,"HOLLOW rang the house when I knocked on the door,"
1811,PERFIDY,And I lingered on the threshold with my hand
1812,PERFIDY,Upraised to knock and knock once more:
1813,PERFIDY,"Listening for the sound of her feet across the floor,"
1814,PERFIDY,Hollow re-echoed my heart.
1815,PERFIDY,
1816,PERFIDY,The low-hung lamps stretched down the road
1817,PERFIDY,"With shadows drifting underneath,"
1818,PERFIDY,"With a music of soft, melodious feet"
1819,PERFIDY,Quickening my hope as I hastened to meet
1820,PERFIDY,The low-hung light of her eyes.
1821,PERFIDY,
1822,PERFIDY,"The golden lamps down the street went out,"
1823,PERFIDY,The last car trailed the night behind;
1824,PERFIDY,And I in the darkness wandered about
1825,PERFIDY,With a flutter of hope and of dark-shut doubt
1826,PERFIDY,In the dying lamp of my love.
1827,PERFIDY,
1828,PERFIDY,Two brown ponies trotting slowly
1829,PERFIDY,Stopped at a dim-lit trough to drink:
1830,PERFIDY,The dark van drummed down the distance slowly;
1831,PERFIDY,While the city stars so dim and holy
1832,PERFIDY,Drew nearer to search through the streets.
1833,PERFIDY,
1834,PERFIDY,"A hastening car swept shameful past,"
1835,PERFIDY,"I saw her hid in the shadow,"
1836,PERFIDY,"I saw her step to the curb, and fast"
1837,PERFIDY,"Run to the silent door, where last"
1838,PERFIDY,I had stood with my hand uplifted.
1839,PERFIDY,"She clung to the door in her haste to enter,"
1840,PERFIDY,"Entered, and quickly cast"
1841,PERFIDY,"It shut behind her, leaving the street aghast."

1966,BROTHER AND SISTER,"Worn her down to the quick, so she faintly fares"
1967,BROTHER AND SISTER,Along her foot-searched way without knowing why

1970,BROTHER AND SISTER,"Some say they see, though I have never seen,"

2060,BLUE,

2110,SNAP-DRAGON,"SHE bade me follow to her garden, where"
2111,SNAP-DRAGON,The mellow sunlight stood as in a cup
2112,SNAP-DRAGON,Between the old grey walls; I did not dare
2113,SNAP-DRAGON,"To raise my face, I did not dare look up,"
2114,SNAP-DRAGON,Lest her bright eyes like sparrows should fly in
2115,SNAP-DRAGON,"My windows of discovery, and shrill ""Sin."""
2116,SNAP-DRAGON,
2117,SNAP-DRAGON,So with a downcast mien and laughing voice
2118,SNAP-DRAGON,"I followed, followed the swing of her white dress"
2119,SNAP-DRAGON,That rocked in a lilt along: I watched the poise
2120,SNAP-DRAGON,"Of her feet as they flew for a space, then paused to"
2121,SNAP-DRAGON,press
2122,SNAP-DRAGON,The grass deep down with the royal burden of her:
2123,SNAP-DRAGON,And gladly I'd offered my breast to the tread of her.
2124,SNAP-DRAGON,
2125,SNAP-DRAGON,"""I like to see,"" she said, and she crouched her down,"
2126,SNAP-DRAGON,She sunk into my sight like a settling bird;
2127,SNAP-DRAGON,And her bosom couched in the confines of her gown
2128,SNAP-DRAGON,"Like heavy birds at rest there, softly stirred"
2129,SNAP-DRAGON,"By her measured breaths: ""I like to see,"" said she,"
2130,SNAP-DRAGON,"""The snap-dragon put out his tongue at me."""
2131,SNAP-DRAGON,
2132,SNAP-DRAGON,"She laughed, she reached her hand out to the flower,"
2133,SNAP-DRAGON,Closing its crimson throat. My own throat in her
2134,SNAP-DRAGON,power
2135,SNAP-DRAGON,"Strangled, my heart swelled up so full"
2136,SNAP-DRAGON,"As if it would burst its wine-skin in my throat,"
2137,SNAP-DRAGON,Choke me in my own crimson. I watched her pull
2138,SNAP-DRAGON,"The gorge of the gaping flower, till the blood did"
2139,SNAP-DRAGON,float
2140,SNAP-DRAGON,
2141,SNAP-DRAGON,"Over my eyes, and I was blind--"
2142,SNAP-DRAGON,Her large brown hand stretched over
2143,SNAP-DRAGON,The windows of my mind;
2144,SNAP-DRAGON,And there in the dark I did discover
2145,SNAP-DRAGON,Things I was out to find:
2146,SNAP-DRAGON,"My Grail, a brown bowl twined"
2147,SNAP-DRAGON,"With swollen veins that met in the wrist,"
2148,SNAP-DRAGON,Under whose brown the amethyst
2149,SNAP-DRAGON,I longed to taste. I longed to turn
2150,SNAP-DRAGON,"My heart's red measure in her cup,"
2151,SNAP-DRAGON,I longed to feel my hot blood burn
2152,SNAP-DRAGON,With the amethyst in her cup.
2153,SNAP-DRAGON,
2154,SNAP-DRAGON,"Then suddenly she looked up,"
2155,SNAP-DRAGON,"And I was blind in a tawny-gold day,"
2156,SNAP-DRAGON,Till she took her eyes away.
2157,SNAP-DRAGON,So she came down from above
2158,SNAP-DRAGON,And emptied my heart of love.
2159,SNAP-DRAGON,So I held my heart aloft
2160,SNAP-DRAGON,"To the cuckoo that hung like a dove,"
2161,SNAP-DRAGON,And she settled soft
2162,SNAP-DRAGON,
2163,SNAP-DRAGON,It seemed that I and the morning world
2164,SNAP-DRAGON,Were pressed cup-shape to take this reiver
2165,SNAP-DRAGON,Bird who was weary to have furled
2166,SNAP-DRAGON,"Her wings in us,"
2167,SNAP-DRAGON,As we were weary to receive her.
2168,SNAP-DRAGON,
2169,SNAP-DRAGON,"This bird, this rich,"
2170,SNAP-DRAGON,"Sumptuous central grain,"
2171,SNAP-DRAGON,"This mutable witch,"
2172,SNAP-DRAGON,"This one refrain,"
2173,SNAP-DRAGON,"This laugh in the fight,"
2174,SNAP-DRAGON,"This clot of night,"
2175,SNAP-DRAGON,This core of delight.
2176,SNAP-DRAGON,
2177,SNAP-DRAGON,"She spoke, and I closed my eyes"
2178,SNAP-DRAGON,To shut hallucinations out.
2179,SNAP-DRAGON,I echoed with surprise
2180,SNAP-DRAGON,Hearing my mere lips shout
2181,SNAP-DRAGON,The answer they did devise.
2182,SNAP-DRAGON,
2183,SNAP-DRAGON,Again I saw a brown bird hover
2184,SNAP-DRAGON,Over the flowers at my feet;
2185,SNAP-DRAGON,I felt a brown bird hover
2186,SNAP-DRAGON,"Over my heart, and sweet"
2187,SNAP-DRAGON,Its shadow lay on my heart.
2188,SNAP-DRAGON,I thought I saw on the clover
2189,SNAP-DRAGON,A brown bee pulling apart
2190,SNAP-DRAGON,The closed flesh of the clover
2191,SNAP-DRAGON,And burrowing in its heart.
2192,SNAP-DRAGON,
2193,SNAP-DRAGON,"She moved her hand, and again"
2194,SNAP-DRAGON,I felt the brown bird cover
2195,SNAP-DRAGON,My heart; and then
2196,SNAP-DRAGON,"The bird came down on my heart,"
2197,SNAP-DRAGON,As on a nest the rover
2198,SNAP-DRAGON,"Cuckoo comes, and shoves over"
2199,SNAP-DRAGON,The brim each careful part
2200,SNAP-DRAGON,"Of love, takes possession, and settles her down,"
2201,SNAP-DRAGON,With her wings and her feathers to drown
2202,SNAP-DRAGON,The nest in a heat of love.
2203,SNAP-DRAGON,
2204,SNAP-DRAGON,She turned her flushed face to me for the glint
2205,SNAP-DRAGON,"Of a moment. ""See,"" she laughed, ""if you also"
2206,SNAP-DRAGON,"Can make them yawn."" I put my hand to the dint"
2207,SNAP-DRAGON,"In the flower's throat, and the flower gaped wide"
2208,SNAP-DRAGON,with woe.
2209,SNAP-DRAGON,"She watched, she went of a sudden intensely still,"
2210,SNAP-DRAGON,"She watched my hand, to see what I would fulfil."
2211,SNAP-DRAGON,
2212,SNAP-DRAGON,"I pressed the wretched, throttled flower between"
2213,SNAP-DRAGON,"My fingers, till its head lay back, its fangs"
2214,SNAP-DRAGON,Poised at her. Like a weapon my hand was white
2215,SNAP-DRAGON,"and keen,"
2216,SNAP-DRAGON,And I held the choked flower-serpent in its pangs
2217,SNAP-DRAGON,"Of mordant anguish, till she ceased to laugh,"
2218,SNAP-DRAGON,"Until her pride's flag, smitten, cleaved down to the"
2219,SNAP-DRAGON,staff.
2220,SNAP-DRAGON,
2221,SNAP-DRAGON,"She hid her face, she murmured between her lips"
2222,SNAP-DRAGON,"The low word ""Don't."" I let the flower fall,"
2223,SNAP-DRAGON,But held my hand afloat towards the slips
2224,SNAP-DRAGON,"Of blossom she fingered, and my fingers all"
2225,SNAP-DRAGON,"Put forth to her: she did not move, nor I,"
2226,SNAP-DRAGON,"For my hand like a snake watched hers, that could"
2227,SNAP-DRAGON,not fly.
2228,SNAP-DRAGON,
2229,SNAP-DRAGON,"Then I laughed in the dark of my heart, I did exult"
2230,SNAP-DRAGON,Like a sudden chuckling of music. I bade her eyes
2231,SNAP-DRAGON,"Meet mine, I opened her helpless eyes to consult"
2232,SNAP-DRAGON,"Their fear, their shame, their joy that underlies"
2233,SNAP-DRAGON,Defeat in such a battle. In the dark of her eyes
2234,SNAP-DRAGON,My heart was fierce to make her laughter rise.
2235,SNAP-DRAGON,
2236,SNAP-DRAGON,"Till her dark deeps shook with convulsive thrills, and"
2237,SNAP-DRAGON,the dark
2238,SNAP-DRAGON,Of her spirit wavered like water thrilled with light;
2239,SNAP-DRAGON,And my heart leaped up in longing to plunge its stark
2240,SNAP-DRAGON,"Fervour within the pool of her twilight,"
2241,SNAP-DRAGON,"Within her spacious soul, to grope in delight."
2242,SNAP-DRAGON,
2243,SNAP-DRAGON,"And I do not care, though the large hands of revenge"
2244,SNAP-DRAGON,"Shall get my throat at last, shall get it soon,"
2245,SNAP-DRAGON,If the joy that they are searching to avenge
2246,SNAP-DRAGON,"Have risen red on my night as a harvest moon,"
2247,SNAP-DRAGON,Which even death can only put out for me;
2248,SNAP-DRAGON,"And death, I know, is better than not-to-be."

2256,A PASSING BELL,"The rain-bruised leaves are suddenly shaken, as a"

2259,A PASSING BELL,"_Yes, my love, I hear._"
2260,A PASSING BELL,
2261,A PASSING BELL,"One lonely bell, one only, the storm-tossed afternoon"
2262,A PASSING BELL,"is braving,"
2263,A PASSING BELL,_Why not let it ring?_
2264,A PASSING BELL,"The roses lean down when they hear it, the tender,"
2265,A PASSING BELL,mild
2266,A PASSING BELL,Flowers of the bleeding-heart fall to the throb--
2267,A PASSING BELL,_It is such a little thing!_
2268,A PASSING BELL,
2269,A PASSING BELL,"A wet bird walks on the lawn, call to the boy to come"
2270,A PASSING BELL,"and look,"
2271,A PASSING BELL,"_Yes, it is over now._"
2272,A PASSING BELL,"Call to him out of the silence, call him to see"
2273,A PASSING BELL,The starling shaking its head as it walks in the
2274,A PASSING BELL,grass--
2275,A PASSING BELL,"_Ah, who knows how?_"
2276,A PASSING BELL,
2277,A PASSING BELL,"He cannot see it, I can never show it him, how it"
2278,A PASSING BELL,shook--
2279,A PASSING BELL,"_Don't disturb him, darling._"
2280,A PASSING BELL,"--Its head as it walked: I can never call him to me,"
2281,A PASSING BELL,"Never, he _is_ not, whatever shall come to pass."
2282,A PASSING BELL,"_No, look at the wet starling._"

2286,IN TROUBLE AND SHAME,
2287,IN TROUBLE AND SHAME,I LOOK at the swaling sunset
2288,IN TROUBLE AND SHAME,And wish I could go also
2289,IN TROUBLE AND SHAME,Through the red doors beyond the black-purple bar.
2290,IN TROUBLE AND SHAME,
2291,IN TROUBLE AND SHAME,I wish that I could go
2292,IN TROUBLE AND SHAME,Through the red doors where I could put off
2293,IN TROUBLE AND SHAME,"My shame like shoes in the porch,"
2294,IN TROUBLE AND SHAME,"My pain like garments,"
2295,IN TROUBLE AND SHAME,And leave my flesh discarded lying
2296,IN TROUBLE AND SHAME,Like luggage of some departed traveller
2297,IN TROUBLE AND SHAME,Gone one knows not where.
2298,IN TROUBLE AND SHAME,
2299,IN TROUBLE AND SHAME,"Then I would turn round,"
2300,IN TROUBLE AND SHAME,"And seeing my cast-off body lying like lumber,"
2301,IN TROUBLE AND SHAME,I would laugh with joy.

2307,ELEGY,"And I am of it, the small sharp stars are quite near,"
2308,ELEGY,The white moon going among them like a white bird
2309,ELEGY,"among snow-berries,"
2310,ELEGY,And the sound of her gently rustling in heaven like
2311,ELEGY,a bird I hear.
2312,ELEGY,
2313,ELEGY,"And I am willing to come to you now, my dear,"
2314,ELEGY,As a pigeon lets itself off from a cathedral dome
2315,ELEGY,"To be lost in the haze of the sky, I would like to"
2316,ELEGY,"come,"
2317,ELEGY,"And be lost out of sight with you, and be gone like"
2318,ELEGY,foam.
2319,ELEGY,
2320,ELEGY,"For I am tired, my dear, and if I could lift my feet,"
2321,ELEGY,My tenacious feet from off the dome of the earth
2322,ELEGY,To fall like a breath within the breathing wind

2327,GREY EVENING,
2328,GREY EVENING,"WHEN you went, how was it you carried with you"
2329,GREY EVENING,"My missal book of fine, flamboyant hours?"
2330,GREY EVENING,"My book of turrets and of red-thorn bowers,"
2331,GREY EVENING,"And skies of gold, and ladies in bright tissue?"
2332,GREY EVENING,
2333,GREY EVENING,"Now underneath a blue-grey twilight, heaped"
2334,GREY EVENING,Beyond the withering snow of the shorn fields
2335,GREY EVENING,Stands rubble of stunted houses; all is reaped
2336,GREY EVENING,And garnered that the golden daylight yields.
2337,GREY EVENING,
2338,GREY EVENING,Dim lamps like yellow poppies glimmer among
2339,GREY EVENING,"The shadowy stubble of the under-dusk,"
2340,GREY EVENING,"As farther off the scythe of night is swung,"
2341,GREY EVENING,And little stars come rolling from their husk.
2342,GREY EVENING,
2343,GREY EVENING,And all the earth is gone into a dust
2344,GREY EVENING,"Of greyness mingled with a fume of gold,"
2345,GREY EVENING,"Covered with aged lichens, pale with must,"
2346,GREY EVENING,And all the sky has withered and gone cold.
2347,GREY EVENING,
2348,GREY EVENING,"And so I sit and scan the book of grey,"
2349,GREY EVENING,"Feeling the shadows like a blind man reading,"
2350,GREY EVENING,All fearful lest I find the last words bleeding
2351,GREY EVENING,With wounds of sunset and the dying day.

2357,FIRELIGHT AND NIGHTFALL,"But oh, the palms of his two black hands are red,"
2358,FIRELIGHT AND NIGHTFALL,Inflamed with binding up the sheaves of dead
2359,FIRELIGHT AND NIGHTFALL,Hours that were once all glory and all queens.
2360,FIRELIGHT AND NIGHTFALL,
2361,FIRELIGHT AND NIGHTFALL,And I remember all the sunny hours
2362,FIRELIGHT AND NIGHTFALL,"Of queens in hyacinth and skies of gold,"
2363,FIRELIGHT AND NIGHTFALL,And morning singing where the woods are scrolled
2364,FIRELIGHT AND NIGHTFALL,And diapered above the chaunting flowers.
2365,FIRELIGHT AND NIGHTFALL,
2366,FIRELIGHT AND NIGHTFALL,Here lamps are white like snowdrops in the grass;
2367,FIRELIGHT AND NIGHTFALL,"The town is like a churchyard, all so still"
2368,FIRELIGHT AND NIGHTFALL,And grey now night is here; nor will
2369,FIRELIGHT AND NIGHTFALL,Another torn red sunset come to pass.
