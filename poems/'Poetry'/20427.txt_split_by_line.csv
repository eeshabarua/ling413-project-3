188,=PAGE=,=The World's Need=
189,=PAGE=,
190,=PAGE=,
191,=PAGE=,"So many gods, so many creeds,"

199,=PAGE=,=High Noon=
200,=PAGE=,
201,=PAGE=,
202,=PAGE=,Time's finger on the dial of my life
203,=PAGE=,Points to high noon! and yet the half-spent day
204,=PAGE=,"Leaves less than half remaining, for the dark,"
205,=PAGE=,Bleak shadows of the grave engulf the end.
206,=PAGE=,
207,=PAGE=,"To those who burn the candle to the stick,"
208,=PAGE=,The sputtering socket yields but little light.
209,=PAGE=,Long life is sadder than an early death.
210,=PAGE=,We cannot count on raveled threads of age
211,=PAGE=,Whereof to weave a fabric. We must use
212,=PAGE=,The warp and woof the ready present yields
213,=PAGE=,And toil while daylight lasts. When I bethink
214,=PAGE=,"How brief the past, the future still more brief,"
215,=PAGE=,"Calls on to action, action! Not for me"
216,=PAGE=,"Is time for retrospection or for dreams,"
217,=PAGE=,Not time for self-laudation or remorse.
218,=PAGE=,Have I done nobly? Then I must not let
219,=PAGE=,Dead yesterday unborn to-morrow shame.
220,=PAGE=,"Have I done wrong? Well, let the bitter taste"
221,=PAGE=,Of fruit that turned to ashes on my lip
222,=PAGE=,"Be my reminder in temptation's hour,"
223,=PAGE=,And keep me silent when I would condemn.
224,=PAGE=,Sometimes it takes the acid of a sin
225,=PAGE=,To cleanse the clouded windows of our souls
226,=PAGE=,So pity may shine through them.
227,=PAGE=,
228,=PAGE=,"Looking back,"
229,=PAGE=,My faults and errors seem like stepping-stones
230,=PAGE=,That led the way to knowledge of the truth
231,=PAGE=,And made me value virtue; sorrows shine
232,=PAGE=,"In rainbow colors o'er the gulf of years,"
233,=PAGE=,Where lie forgotten pleasures.
234,=PAGE=,
235,=PAGE=,"Looking forth,"
236,=PAGE=,"Out to the western sky still bright with noon,"
237,=PAGE=,I feel well spurred and booted for the strife
238,=PAGE=,That ends not till Nirvana is attained.
239,=PAGE=,
240,=PAGE=,"Battling with fate, with men and with myself,"
241,=PAGE=,"Up the steep summit of my life's forenoon,"
242,=PAGE=,"Three things I learned, three things of precious worth"
243,=PAGE=,To guide and help me down the western slope.
244,=PAGE=,"I have learned how to pray, and toil, and save."
245,=PAGE=,"To pray for courage to receive what comes,"
246,=PAGE=,Knowing what comes to be divinely sent.
247,=PAGE=,"To toil for universal good, since thus"
248,=PAGE=,And only thus can good come unto me.
249,=PAGE=,"To save, by giving whatsoe'er I have"
250,=PAGE=,"To those who have not, this alone is gain."
251,=PAGE=,
252,=PAGE=,
253,=PAGE=,
254,=PAGE=,
255,=PAGE=,=Transformation=
256,=PAGE=,
257,=PAGE=,
258,=PAGE=,She waited in a rose-hued room;
259,=PAGE=,"A wanton-hearted creature she,"
260,=PAGE=,But beautiful and bright to see
261,=PAGE=,As some great orchid just in bloom.
262,=PAGE=,
263,=PAGE=,Upon wide cushions stretched at ease
264,=PAGE=,"She lolled in garments filmy fine,"
265,=PAGE=,Which but enhanced each rounded line;
266,=PAGE=,"A living picture, framed to please."
267,=PAGE=,
268,=PAGE=,A bold electric eye of light
269,=PAGE=,Leered through its ruddy screen of lace
270,=PAGE=,And feasted on her form and face
271,=PAGE=,As some wine-crimsoned rou√© might.
272,=PAGE=,
273,=PAGE=,"From wall and niche, nude nymph beguiled"
274,=PAGE=,"Fair goddesses of world-wide fame,"
275,=PAGE=,But Psyche's self was put to shame
276,=PAGE=,By one who from the cushions smiled.
277,=PAGE=,
278,=PAGE=,Exotic blossoms from a vase
279,=PAGE=,Their sweet narcotic breath exhaled;
280,=PAGE=,"The lights, the objects round her paled--"
281,=PAGE=,She lost the sense of time and place.
282,=PAGE=,
283,=PAGE=,"She seemed to float upon the air,"
284,=PAGE=,"Untrammeled, unrestricted, free;"
285,=PAGE=,And rising from a vapory sea
286,=PAGE=,She saw a form divinely fair.
287,=PAGE=,
288,=PAGE=,A beauteous being in whose face
289,=PAGE=,Shone all things sweet and true and good.
290,=PAGE=,"The innocence of maidenhood,"
291,=PAGE=,The motherhood of all the race.
292,=PAGE=,
293,=PAGE=,"The warmth which comes from heavenly fire,"
294,=PAGE=,The strength which leads the weaker man
295,=PAGE=,To climb to God's Eternal plan
296,=PAGE=,And conquer and control desire.
297,=PAGE=,
298,=PAGE=,"She shook as with a mighty awe,"
299,=PAGE=,"For, gazing on this shape which stood"
300,=PAGE=,"Embodying all true womanhood,"
301,=PAGE=,She knew it was _herself_ she saw.
302,=PAGE=,
303,=PAGE=,She woke as from a dream. But when
304,=PAGE=,"The laughing lover, light and bold"
305,=PAGE=,Came with his talk of wine and gold
306,=PAGE=,"He gazed, grew silent, gazed again;"
307,=PAGE=,
308,=PAGE=,Then turned abashed from those calm eyes
309,=PAGE=,Where lurked no more the lure to sin.
310,=PAGE=,"Her higher self had entered in,"
311,=PAGE=,Her path led now to Paradise.
312,=PAGE=,
313,=PAGE=,
314,=PAGE=,
315,=PAGE=,
316,=PAGE=,=Thought-Magnets=
317,=PAGE=,
318,=PAGE=,
319,=PAGE=,"With each strong thought, with every earnest longing"
320,=PAGE=,"For aught thou deemest needful to thy soul,"
321,=PAGE=,Invisible vast forces are set thronging
322,=PAGE=,Between thee and that goal.
323,=PAGE=,
324,=PAGE=,'Tis only when some hidden weakness alters
325,=PAGE=,"And changes thy desire, or makes it less,"
326,=PAGE=,That this mysterious army ever falters
327,=PAGE=,Or stops short of success.
328,=PAGE=,
329,=PAGE=,Thought is a magnet; and the longed-for pleasure
330,=PAGE=,"Or boon, or aim, or object, is the steel;"
331,=PAGE=,And its attainment hangs but on the measure
332,=PAGE=,Of what thy soul can feel.
333,=PAGE=,
334,=PAGE=,
335,=PAGE=,
336,=PAGE=,
337,=PAGE=,=Smiles=
338,=PAGE=,
339,=PAGE=,
340,=PAGE=,"Smile a little, smile a little,"
341,=PAGE=,"As you go along,"
342,=PAGE=,"Not alone when life is pleasant,"
343,=PAGE=,But when things go wrong.
344,=PAGE=,"Care delights to see you frowning,"
345,=PAGE=,Loves to hear you sigh;
346,=PAGE=,"Turn a smiling face upon her,"
347,=PAGE=,Quick the dame will fly.
348,=PAGE=,
349,=PAGE=,"Smile a little, smile a little,"
350,=PAGE=,All along the road;
351,=PAGE=,"Every life must have its burden,"
352,=PAGE=,Every heart its load.
353,=PAGE=,"Why sit down in gloom and darkness,"
354,=PAGE=,With your grief to sup?
355,=PAGE=,"As you drink Fate's bitter tonic,"
356,=PAGE=,Smile across the cup.
357,=PAGE=,
358,=PAGE=,Smile upon the troubled pilgrims
359,=PAGE=,Whom you pass and meet;
360,=PAGE=,"Frowns are thorns, and smiles are blossoms"
361,=PAGE=,Oft for weary feet.
362,=PAGE=,
363,=PAGE=,Do not make the way seem harder
364,=PAGE=,"By a sullen face,"
365,=PAGE=,"Smile a little, smile a little,"
366,=PAGE=,Brighten up the place.
367,=PAGE=,
368,=PAGE=,Smile upon your undone labor;
369,=PAGE=,Not for one who grieves
370,=PAGE=,"O'er his task, waits wealth or glory;"
371,=PAGE=,He who smiles achieves.
372,=PAGE=,Though you meet with loss and sorrow
373,=PAGE=,"In the passing years,"
374,=PAGE=,"Smile a little, smile a little,"
375,=PAGE=,Even through your tears.

377,=PAGE=,
378,=PAGE=,
379,=PAGE=,
380,=PAGE=,=The Undiscovered Country=
381,=PAGE=,
382,=PAGE=,
383,=PAGE=,"Man has explored all countries and all lands,"
384,=PAGE=,And made his own the secrets of each clime.
385,=PAGE=,"Now, ere the world has fully reached its prime,"
386,=PAGE=,The oval earth lies compassed with steel bands;
387,=PAGE=,"The seas are slaves to ships that touch all strands,"
388,=PAGE=,And even the haughty elements sublime
389,=PAGE=,"And bold, yield him their secrets for all time,"
390,=PAGE=,And speed like lackeys forth at his commands.
391,=PAGE=,
392,=PAGE=,"Still, though he search from shore to distant shore,"
393,=PAGE=,"And no strange realms, no unlocated plains"
394,=PAGE=,"Are left for his attainment and control,"
395,=PAGE=,Yet is there one more kingdom to explore.
396,=PAGE=,"Go, know thyself, O man! there yet remains"
397,=PAGE=,The undiscovered country of thy soul!

402,=PAGE=,=The Universal Route=
403,=PAGE=,
404,=PAGE=,
405,=PAGE=,"As we journey along, with a laugh and a song,"
406,=PAGE=,"We see, on youth's flower-decked slope,"
407,=PAGE=,"Like a beacon of light, shining fair on the sight,"
408,=PAGE=,The beautiful Station of Hope.
409,=PAGE=,
410,=PAGE=,"But the wheels of old Time roll along as we climb,"
411,=PAGE=,And our youth speeds away on the years;
412,=PAGE=,And with hearts that are numb with life's sorrows we come
413,=PAGE=,To the mist-covered Station of Tears.
414,=PAGE=,
415,=PAGE=,"Still onward we pass, where the milestones, alas!"
416,=PAGE=,"Are the tombs of our dead, to the West,"
417,=PAGE=,"Where glitters and gleams, in the dying sunbeams,"
418,=PAGE=,"The sweet, silent Station of Rest."
419,=PAGE=,
420,=PAGE=,"All rest is but change, and no grave can estrange"
421,=PAGE=,The soul from its Parent above;
422,=PAGE=,"And, scorning the rod, it soars back to its God,"
423,=PAGE=,To the limitless City of Love.

429,=PAGE=,
430,=PAGE=,

445,=PAGE=,Since in his silence and refusal lies
446,=PAGE=,"Their self-development, so God abides"
447,=PAGE=,Unheeding many prayers. He is not deaf

455,=PAGE=,What a world

463,=PAGE=,In my fierce youth

485,=PAGE=,For blessings common in our sight
486,=PAGE=,We rarely offer praises.
487,=PAGE=,We sigh for some supreme delight
488,=PAGE=,"To crown our lives with splendor,"
489,=PAGE=,And quite ignore our daily store
490,=PAGE=,Of pleasures sweet and tender.
491,=PAGE=,
492,=PAGE=,Our cares are bold and push their way
493,=PAGE=,Upon our thought and feeling.
494,=PAGE=,"They hang about us all the day,"
495,=PAGE=,Our time from pleasure stealing.
496,=PAGE=,So unobtrusive many a joy
497,=PAGE=,"We pass by and forget it,"
498,=PAGE=,But worry strives to own our lives
499,=PAGE=,And conquers if we let it.
500,=PAGE=,
501,=PAGE=,There's not a day in all the year
502,=PAGE=,"But holds some hidden pleasure,"
503,=PAGE=,"And looking back, joys oft appear"
504,=PAGE=,To brim the past's wide measure.
505,=PAGE=,"But blessings are like friends, I hold,"
506,=PAGE=,Who love and labor near us.
507,=PAGE=,We ought to raise our notes of praise
508,=PAGE=,While living hearts can hear us.
509,=PAGE=,
510,=PAGE=,Full many a blessing wears the guise
511,=PAGE=,Of worry or of trouble.
512,=PAGE=,Farseeing is the soul and wise
513,=PAGE=,Who knows the mask is double.
514,=PAGE=,But he who has the faith and strength
515,=PAGE=,To thank his God for sorrow
516,=PAGE=,Has found a joy without alloy
517,=PAGE=,To gladden every morrow.
518,=PAGE=,
519,=PAGE=,We ought to make the moments notes
520,=PAGE=,"Of happy, glad Thanksgiving;"
521,=PAGE=,The hours and days a silent phrase
522,=PAGE=,Of music we are living.
523,=PAGE=,And so the theme should swell and grow

1471,=PAGE=,"A week of labor limbered up my stiffened hand and voice,"

3308,XXVII.,"Pulsed through the air, like some sad song well sung,"
3309,XXVII.,"Which gives delight, although the soul is wrung."
3310,XXVII.,Farther and fainter to the sight and sound
3311,XXVII.,The beautiful embodied poem wound;
3312,XXVII.,"Till like a ribbon, stretched across the land"
3313,XXVII.,Seemed the long narrow line of that receding band.

3317,XXVIII.,
3318,XXVIII.,The lot of those who in the silence wait
3319,XXVIII.,Is harder than the fighting soldiers' fate.
3320,XXVIII.,"Back to the lonely post two women passed,"
3321,XXVIII.,With unaccustomed sorrow overcast.
3322,XXVIII.,"Two sad for sighs, too desolate for tears,"
3323,XXVIII.,The dark forebodings of long widowed years
3324,XXVIII.,In preparation for the awful blow
3325,XXVIII.,Hung on the door of hope the sable badge of woe.

3329,XXIX.,
3330,XXIX.,"Unhappy Muse! for thee no song remains,"
3331,XXIX.,Save the sad mis√©r√©r√© of the plains.
3332,XXIX.,"Yet though defeat, not triumph, ends the tale,"
3333,XXIX.,Great victors sometimes are the souls that fail.
3334,XXIX.,"All glory lies not in the goals we reach,"
3335,XXIX.,But in the lessons which our actions teach.
3336,XXIX.,"And he who, conquered, to the end believes"
3337,XXIX.,"In God and in himself, though vanquished, still achieves."

3342,XXX.,"Ah, grand as rash was that last fatal raid"
3343,XXX.,The little group of daring heroes made.
3344,XXX.,Two hundred and two score intrepid men
3345,XXX.,Rode out to war; not one came back again.
3346,XXX.,Like fiends incarnate from the depths of hell
3347,XXX.,"Five thousand foemen rose with deafening yell,"
3348,XXX.,"And swept that vale as with a simoon's breath,"
3349,XXX.,"But like the gods of old, each martyr met his death."

3353,XXXI.,
3354,XXXI.,Like gods they battled and like gods they died.
3355,XXXI.,Hour following hour that little band defied
3356,XXXI.,"The hordes of red men swarming o'er the plain,"
3357,XXXI.,Till scarce a score stood upright 'mid the slain.
3358,XXXI.,"Then in the lull of battle, creeping near,"
3359,XXXI.,A scout breathed low in Custer's listening ear:
3360,XXXI.,"""_Death lies before, dear life remains behind"
3361,XXXI.,"Mount thy sure-footed steed, and hasten with the wind_."""

3366,XXXII.,"A second's silence. Custer dropped his head,"
3367,XXXII.,His lips slow moving as when prayers are said--
3368,XXXII.,"Two words he breathed--""God and Elizabeth,"""
3369,XXXII.,"Then shook his long locks in the face of death,"
3370,XXXII.,And with a final gesture turned away
3371,XXXII.,To join that fated few who stood at bay.
3372,XXXII.,Ah! deeds like that the Christ in man reveal
3373,XXXII.,Let Fame descend her throne at Custer's shrine to kneel.

3378,XXXIII.,"Too late to rescue, but in time to weep,"
3379,XXXIII.,His tardy comrades came. As if asleep
3380,XXXIII.,"He lay, so fair, that even hellish hate"
3381,XXXIII.,Withheld its hand and dared not mutilate.
3382,XXXIII.,"By fiends who knew not honor, honored still,"
3383,XXXIII.,He smiled and slept on that far western hill.
3384,XXXIII.,"Cast down thy lyre, oh Muse! thy song is done!"
3385,XXXIII.,"Let tears complete the tale of him who failed, yet won."
