103,PART I.,"The meek-eyed kine on summer days,"
104,PART I.,"At early morn swept Daisy Dare,--"
105,PART I.,"Sparkling, graceful, passing fair."
106,PART I.,
107,PART I.,Sparkling as the dew-drops gleaming
108,PART I.,"On her path, or sunlight streaming"
109,PART I.,"Through her tresses--graceful, fair,"
110,PART I.,As naught on earth save Daisy Dare!
111,PART I.,
112,PART I.,Wondrous tresses! sunshine fades
113,PART I.,"Mid floating curls and sumptuous braids,--"
114,PART I.,A crown of light that glorifies
115,PART I.,White brow and deep impassioned eyes.
116,PART I.,
117,PART I.,"Full, perfect, tempting were her lips--"
118,PART I.,The bee or humming-bird that sips
119,PART I.,From scarlet blossoms in the South
120,PART I.,Beguiled might be by such a mouth.
121,PART I.,
122,PART I.,Her path ran by a rushing stream
123,PART I.,"Which, like a crooked silver seam,"
124,PART I.,"Bound that green meadow to a wood,"
125,PART I.,Where soon with Graham Lee she stood.
126,PART I.,
127,PART I.,Softly through arching forest-trees
128,PART I.,Came stealing up a fresh salt breeze;
129,PART I.,"One fair cheek kissing, till it burned"
130,PART I.,Like to the other Lee-ward turned.
131,PART I.,
132,PART I.,"""Daisy,"" he said, ""I sail to-day"
133,PART I.,"For India, with Captain Gray;"
134,PART I.,Will you not be upon the strand
135,PART I.,"To say 'farewell'--to wave your hand?"""
136,PART I.,
137,PART I.,"""Yes; I will go to see you sail:"""
138,PART I.,The tone was proud--her cheek turned pale;
139,PART I.,"""I've promised to be there and say"
140,PART I.,"A parting word to Allen Gray."""
141,PART I.,
142,PART I.,The strong man's cheek grew white as death
143,PART I.,"As thus, with short, unsteady breath,"
144,PART I.,"He said: ""When last I went to sea,"
145,PART I.,"You waved, nay, kissed your hand to me."""
146,PART I.,
147,PART I.,"Her eyes flashed, smiling on him then--"
148,PART I.,"Such eyes hold fiery, earnest men"
149,PART I.,"In bondage, and to love beguile,"
150,PART I.,"Whether they mock, or weep, or smile."
151,PART I.,
152,PART I.,"""Yes; I remember then to you"
153,PART I.,I kissed my hand; but here are two:
154,PART I.,"Can I not still kiss this one, pray,"
155,PART I.,"To you, and this to Allen Gray?"""
156,PART I.,
157,PART I.,[Illustration:
158,PART I.,
159,PART I.,"""Oh, do not mock me, Daisy Dare,"
160,PART I.,"With your small hands so soft and fair.""]"
161,PART I.,
162,PART I.,
163,PART I.,"Her voice was deep, the words were light,"
164,PART I.,"The hands upheld were small and white,--"
165,PART I.,Such hands as strong men love to grasp
166,PART I.,And crush in an impassioned clasp.
167,PART I.,
168,PART I.,"""Oh, do not mock me, Daisy Dare,"
169,PART I.,With your small hands so soft and fair;
170,PART I.,They may beguile both lovers--true;
171,PART I.,You cannot give your heart to two.
172,PART I.,
173,PART I.,"""One or the other let it be;"
174,PART I.,"If Allen Gray, you're lost to me:"
175,PART I.,"If me, all hearts you must resign,--"
176,PART I.,All homage and all love save mine.
177,PART I.,
178,PART I.,"""My guiding star across the brine,"
179,PART I.,Has been the hope that called you mine;
180,PART I.,"I'd rather see that load-star set,"
181,PART I.,"Than wed a fair, false, vain coquette."
182,PART I.,
183,PART I.,"""I'd rather trust, though seas divide,"
184,PART I.,Than linger doubting by your side:
185,PART I.,"Now speak, what turns your heart away;"
186,PART I.,"The love of gold or Allen Gray?"""
187,PART I.,
188,PART I.,"Up rose her spirit, quick and proud;"
189,PART I.,"And, as through a translucent cloud"
190,PART I.,"Pour crimson streams of torrid light,"
191,PART I.,The red blood dyed her forehead white.
192,PART I.,
193,PART I.,"""I have not broken faith or vow,"""
194,PART I.,"She said; ""but do release you now."
195,PART I.,My heart cannot be bought or sold
196,PART I.,By Allen Gray with love or gold.
197,PART I.,
198,PART I.,"""I trifled with him but to try"
199,PART I.,Your faith in me: I'd rather die
200,PART I.,Than wed a man of jealous heart:
201,PART I.,"You cannot trust me, let us part."
202,PART I.,
203,PART I.,"""The jealous love you bring to me,"
204,PART I.,"(As yonder green, impulsive sea"
205,PART I.,"Unto the shore doth come and go,)"
206,PART I.,In passion tides would ebb and flow.
207,PART I.,
208,PART I.,"""And as that surf, in fitful swells,"
209,PART I.,Doth bring or bear away the shells
210,PART I.,"From yonder strand,--such passion, strife"
211,PART I.,"Would fill, or desolate my life."
212,PART I.,
213,PART I.,"""Such earthly crown of love to wear,"
214,PART I.,The cross it brings I would not bear;
215,PART I.,Here! see me cast the burden down:
216,PART I.,"Go!--for I yield you up the crown."""
217,PART I.,
218,PART I.,"The angry flush had faded now,"
219,PART I.,"Leaving her bosom, cheek, and brow"
220,PART I.,Whiter than sea-foam 'neath the moon;
221,PART I.,Her low voice as sad wind-harp's tune.
222,PART I.,
223,PART I.,She waved her hand and turned away:
224,PART I.,"He caught it, crying, ""Daisy, stay!"
225,PART I.,Let not a flash of passion-pride
226,PART I.,"Two clinging hearts like ours divide."""
227,PART I.,
228,PART I.,"She stood before him haughty, cold:"
229,PART I.,"""You taunted me with love of gold--"
230,PART I.,Who wealth and titles scorned--to be
231,PART I.,"The chosen bride of Graham Lee."""
232,PART I.,
233,PART I.,"""This choice, perhaps, you now regret,"
234,PART I.,And crave a titled suitor yet;
235,PART I.,"Hearts that are anchored side by side,"
236,PART I.,"No surface-ripple can divide."""
237,PART I.,
238,PART I.,"His words were bitter in their turn,"
239,PART I.,"And, like sharp acid on a burn,"
240,PART I.,"They scorched her heart, and seared the spot"
241,PART I.,"Where blossomed love's ""forget-me-not."""
242,PART I.,
243,PART I.,"Oh, why are darts of anger hurled"
244,PART I.,From heart to heart throughout the world;
245,PART I.,"Fierce as the lightning--flashing far,"
246,PART I.,"From cloud to cloud, its red-hot bar?"
247,PART I.,
248,PART I.,"So quick, so sharp, too oft it cleaves"
249,PART I.,"The sandal-chain of love, and leaves"
250,PART I.,"But fragrant, broken, links at last"
251,PART I.,To bind us to a ruined past.
252,PART I.,
253,PART I.,Too often fixing deeps of woe
254,PART I.,Between us and the long ago;
255,PART I.,"Bridging a gulf toward mem'ries green,"
256,PART I.,"With one regret--""it might have been."""
257,PART I.,
258,PART I.,"Oh, why, when life is in its June"
259,PART I.,"Of fruity fragrance, perfect tune,"
260,PART I.,Does passion's stormy pride destroy
261,PART I.,Youths' heritage of love and joy?
262,PART I.,
263,PART I.,One jealous breath will oft disclose
264,PART I.,"A canker in hope's perfect rose,"
265,PART I.,For the false fever heat of strife
266,PART I.,"To nurse, and nourish into life."
267,PART I.,
268,PART I.,"Oh, Daisy Dare! the sea is wide:"
269,PART I.,Dear is the lover by thy side:
270,PART I.,"The sea is treacherous, hungry, deep,"
271,PART I.,And millions o'er its treasures weep.
272,PART I.,
273,PART I.,His heart relented--strong hearts do;
274,PART I.,"Yet more relenting, oft less true"
275,PART I.,"Than those, unyielding, that defy"
276,PART I.,The deathless love of which they die.
277,PART I.,
278,PART I.,"""As forest saplings, by the sun"
279,PART I.,Together knit till two are one--
280,PART I.,"One trunk, one bark, one sap, one tree--"
281,PART I.,"Our hearts have been, should ever be."
282,PART I.,
283,PART I.,"""Let sharp steel cleave that circling rind,"
284,PART I.,No art its severed strength could bind;
285,PART I.,"Should anger part thy love from mine,"
286,PART I.,"Holds earth another heart for thine?"""
287,PART I.,
288,PART I.,"Oh, stubborn pride! unyielding still;"
289,PART I.,Her heart is conquered; but her will
290,PART I.,"Defies its tender, pleading tone:"
291,PART I.,She left him--they were both alone.
292,PART I.,
293,PART I.,*       *       *       *       *
294,PART I.,
295,PART I.,When eve her golden goblet fills
296,PART I.,"Among the sunset's purple hills,"
297,PART I.,And overflows that sunset wine
298,PART I.,"In streams of glory on the brine,"
299,PART I.,
300,PART I.,"Unto the shore a maiden came,"
301,PART I.,"Who gazed where, down that track of flame"
302,PART I.,A steamer to the west did dip:
303,PART I.,Her heart went outward with the ship.
304,PART I.,
305,PART I.,"She had not kept her tryst that day,"
306,PART I.,Nor waved her hand to Allen Gray:
307,PART I.,Both little hands were still--'twas true
308,PART I.,"She could not ""give her heart to two."""
309,PART I.,
310,PART I.,"She heard the parting signals sound,"
311,PART I.,And then the haughty pride that bound
312,PART I.,"Her woman's heart, which had defied"
313,PART I.,"Her woman's love, grew faint and died."
314,PART I.,
315,PART I.,[Illustration:
316,PART I.,
317,PART I.,"""She wandered hopeless to the strand,"
318,PART I.,"And, hopeless, westward waved her hand.""]"
319,PART I.,
320,PART I.,She heard the steamship's iron bell;
321,PART I.,"Turned to the shore, but faltered, fell--"
322,PART I.,For ocean steamers do not wait
323,PART I.,On love--her pride gave way too late.
324,PART I.,
325,PART I.,"""Too late!"" she heard it rise and swell,"
326,PART I.,Tolled by the iron steamer's bell;
327,PART I.,"Told by the mocking voice of Fate,"
328,PART I.,"Rung through her heart, ""too late!"" ""too late!"""
329,PART I.,
330,PART I.,"And now, when from that outward bound,"
331,PART I.,"Defiant distance brought no sound,"
332,PART I.,"She wandered hopeless to the strand,"
333,PART I.,"And, hopeless, westward waved her hand."
334,PART I.,
335,PART I.,The steamer's black smoke drifting far
336,PART I.,Rose up and hid the evening star:
337,PART I.,A bitter symbol of that strife
338,PART I.,Between love's day-star and her life.
339,PART I.,
340,PART I.,In the late gloaming's purple gloom
341,PART I.,She wandered home; but half the bloom
342,PART I.,Had faded from her cheek and lips:
343,PART I.,Love's orient was in eclipse.

349,PART I.,"""The ship went down!"" such message crossed"
350,PART I.,"The lightning wire, and all were lost"
351,PART I.,"Save Captain Gray, and two or three;"
352,PART I.,Among them was not Graham Lee.
353,PART I.,
354,PART I.,From Daisy's hand the paper fell;
355,PART I.,"No cry she uttered, but a swell"
356,PART I.,"Of anguish through her heart did sweep,"
357,PART I.,Bearing it downward to the deep.
358,PART I.,
359,PART I.,As the green pallor of a storm
360,PART I.,"A summer landscape doth deform,"
361,PART I.,Making a livid shadow grow
362,PART I.,"Athwart the noon-day's ruddy glow,"
363,PART I.,
364,PART I.,"Across the future once so fair,"
365,PART I.,"So ripe with joy for Daisy Dare,"
366,PART I.,"Fate's cruel sickle swept, and left"
367,PART I.,Life of its golden harvest reft.

379,PART II.,PART II.
380,PART II.,
381,PART II.,
382,PART II.,"Women are deemed cold, careless, proud,"
383,PART II.,Who suffer bravely in a crowd;
384,PART II.,"Smiles flash from hearts in sorrow set,"
385,PART II.,As gleams from jewels edged with jet.
386,PART II.,
387,PART II.,Some months had passed--it was not long--
388,PART II.,"When Daisy stood amid a throng,"
389,PART II.,"Turning her white cheek from the light,"
390,PART II.,Clasping her small hands fiercely tight!
391,PART II.,
392,PART II.,"For she had heard two brave men say,--"
393,PART II.,"A stranger one--one Allen Gray,--"
394,PART II.,No braver hero ever died
395,PART II.,Than he whose love she lost through pride.
396,PART II.,
397,PART II.,"Unselfish, earnest, daring, brave,"
398,PART II.,All but himself he tried to save;
399,PART II.,Heedless of death and danger--why?
400,PART II.,One heart alone could make reply.
401,PART II.,
402,PART II.,One spirit that had vainly sought
403,PART II.,Rest from a hungry surge of thought;
404,PART II.,Fierce retribution!--thus to be
405,PART II.,Tortured by praise of Graham Lee!
406,PART II.,
407,PART II.,Hero! but not for her to claim--
408,PART II.,"There was the anguish, there the shame:"
409,PART II.,How little yielding 'twould have cost
410,PART II.,"To call him still her own, though lost."
411,PART II.,
412,PART II.,"But she had cast away the right,"
413,PART II.,"And, mutely wretched, heard that night,"
414,PART II.,"With stormy heart and tearless cheek,"
415,PART II.,His praise whose name she dared not speak.
416,PART II.,
417,PART II.,Few knew that they were lovers--none
418,PART II.,That their two hearts had pulsed as one;
419,PART II.,So the world called her cold and changed;
420,PART II.,Friends thought her haughty and estranged.
421,PART II.,
422,PART II.,The current of her life's May-time
423,PART II.,Ran chill beneath a crust of rime;
424,PART II.,"And lovers wore, for Daisy's sake,"
425,PART II.,The icy chains they could not break.
426,PART II.,
427,PART II.,A yearning sadness in her face
428,PART II.,"But added to that nameless grace,"
429,PART II.,That spell by which some women reign
430,PART II.,In hearts they never strove to gain.
431,PART II.,
432,PART II.,Love fell on her superb repose
433,PART II.,"Like warm light on a sculptured rose,"
434,PART II.,As if--beguiled--to flush apart
435,PART II.,The chiselled whiteness of its heart.
436,PART II.,
437,PART II.,The voice of passion to her soul
438,PART II.,"Swept, as the storm-voiced surges roll"
439,PART II.,"Up toward a star-like beacon steep,"
440,PART II.,Dashed backward rayless to the deep.
441,PART II.,
442,PART II.,As fire-fly lighting up a maze
443,PART II.,Of cobwebs with its dying blaze;
444,PART II.,Held by a grim black spider fast--
445,PART II.,Flashing with glory to the last.
446,PART II.,
447,PART II.,"Thus tangled in a cruel fate,"
448,PART II.,"Dared through her folly, feared too late,"
449,PART II.,The light of Daisy's lost love made
450,PART II.,The past fall back in deepest shade.
451,PART II.,
452,PART II.,Strong natures suffer more than those
453,PART II.,"Who, bowing down, parade their woes"
454,PART II.,"For a brief season, and then rise:"
455,PART II.,The brave heart uncomplaining dies.
456,PART II.,
457,PART II.,So after years that inner gloom
458,PART II.,"Had only softened Daisy's bloom,"
459,PART II.,Giving such meaning to her eyes
460,PART II.,As worldlings cannot analyze.
461,PART II.,
462,PART II.,And when her pink cheek turned too soon
463,PART II.,"Pale as magnolia buds in June,"
464,PART II.,"No one could call its fairness blight,"
465,PART II.,Or wish a flush upon the white.
466,PART II.,
467,PART II.,When just one shade of roundness passed
468,PART II.,"From her proud form, they said at last"
469,PART II.,That she must travel. Well she knew
470,PART II.,Love and regret would travel too!
471,PART II.,
472,PART II.,"'Twas not one shore alone, whose surge"
473,PART II.,Came wailing to her like a dirge;
474,PART II.,"The surf, the waves of every sea,"
475,PART II.,"Everywhere, moaned of Graham Lee."
476,PART II.,
477,PART II.,"And when in a far distant land,"
478,PART II.,"Upon a sunny southern strand,"
479,PART II.,"Where warm waves, green as malachite,"
480,PART II.,"Come leaping, as from vats of light,"
481,PART II.,
482,PART II.,Where summer's sumptuous golden blaze
483,PART II.,Wraps earth in a voluptuous haze
484,PART II.,Of lambent splendor; where the skies
485,PART II.,"Drop balm as erst in Paradise,"
486,PART II.,
487,PART II.,Where clusters of imperial trees
488,PART II.,Nod their green plumes o'er slumberous seas;
489,PART II.,"Warm, amorous deeps! whose crystal calms"
490,PART II.,Dream of the emerald-crested palms.
491,PART II.,
492,PART II.,A shore of bloom! a sea so bright!
493,PART II.,Entranced they mingle in the light;
494,PART II.,"Apart--yet wedded by the sun,"
495,PART II.,As severed hearts through love made one.
496,PART II.,
497,PART II.,Where air as an elixir fine
498,PART II.,Exhilarates like sparkling wine;
499,PART II.,Where mere existence brings a joy
500,PART II.,Life's trifling ills cannot destroy:
501,PART II.,
502,PART II.,"There, where the aromatic breeze--"
503,PART II.,"Fledged in a nest of orange-trees,"
504,PART II.,Kissing the slumb'rous waves--made sweet
505,PART II.,The sea-foam swept to Daisy's feet.
506,PART II.,
507,PART II.,"The gloom, the shadow, passed not by;"
508,PART II.,"Still white her cheek, as shells that lie"
509,PART II.,"Like drifted snow on golden strand,"
510,PART II.,Where stood she writing in the sand.
511,PART II.,
512,PART II.,And still the envious surges came
513,PART II.,To wash away that precious name
514,PART II.,"Writ on her heart's warm shore for years,"
515,PART II.,Merged by its tidal flow of tears.
516,PART II.,
517,PART II.,"She stood in a sequestered cove,"
518,PART II.,While countless memories of love
519,PART II.,"Heaped treasure, till her sea of grief"
520,PART II.,Blushed--breaking on a coral-reef!
521,PART II.,
522,PART II.,For precious memories often grow
523,PART II.,From out the darkest voids of woe;
524,PART II.,As fissures by the sea-worm drilled
525,PART II.,"In Eastern shells, with pearls are filled."
526,PART II.,
527,PART II.,"The creeping tide swells, shot with flame,"
528,PART II.,Stole up and kissed away that name
529,PART II.,"Which Fate indeed, with mocking hand,"
530,PART II.,For her had written in the sand.
531,PART II.,
532,PART II.,"Outward, upon her right did reach"
533,PART II.,"A long, white, narrow line of beach,"
534,PART II.,"Where careless groups now idly strayed,"
535,PART II.,Watching the flush of sunset fade.
536,PART II.,
537,PART II.,And when across that crimson glow
538,PART II.,"Her gaze went out as long ago,"
539,PART II.,"O'er colder seas, unto a ship"
540,PART II.,"Which toward the setting sun did dip,"
541,PART II.,
542,PART II.,On the far point of that white sand
543,PART II.,"Standing together, hand in hand,"
544,PART II.,Like forms of sculptured bronze revealed
545,PART II.,"Against the sunset's burnished shield,"
546,PART II.,
547,PART II.,"Two figures smote her 'wildered sight,"
548,PART II.,And left two blots upon the light;
549,PART II.,Darker than iron ship afar
550,PART II.,Or smoke that hid the evening star.
551,PART II.,
552,PART II.,"For there, between her and the sun,"
553,PART II.,"Stood Graham Lee, and with him one"
554,PART II.,Whose beauty stirred to bitter strife
555,PART II.,The chilly current of her life.
556,PART II.,
557,PART II.,[Illustration:
558,PART II.,
559,PART II.,"""Two figures smote her 'wildered sight,"
560,PART II.,"And left two blots upon the light.""]"
561,PART II.,
562,PART II.,
563,PART II.,As summer sends a mighty thrill
564,PART II.,"Through clust'ring icy floes, until"
565,PART II.,Their shudd'ring breaks the ghastly sleep
566,PART II.,Of Nova Zembla's pallid deep.
567,PART II.,
568,PART II.,More dead he seemed to her that hour--
569,PART II.,"There, in the strength of manly power,"
570,PART II.,Bending to see those dark eyes shine--
571,PART II.,Than cold and still beneath the brine.
572,PART II.,
573,PART II.,Six years had marked their weary length
574,PART II.,On her young life--whose faith and strength
575,PART II.,A widowed heart left purified--
576,PART II.,"To live, now wishing she had died."
577,PART II.,
578,PART II.,"More lost she felt, and more alone,"
579,PART II.,"Leaning against that hard, cold stone,"
580,PART II.,"Than when his ship was outward bound,"
581,PART II.,Or when she thought of him as drowned.
582,PART II.,
583,PART II.,"They turned, and sauntered towards the cove;"
584,PART II.,"Oh, woman's strength! oh, woman's love!"
585,PART II.,"She stirred not till their eyes had met,"
586,PART II.,And knew herself remembered yet.
587,PART II.,
588,PART II.,"Down wastes of absence, grief, and gloom--"
589,PART II.,Warmed by his gaze--uprose the bloom
590,PART II.,"Of Hope's lost violets through the snow,"
591,PART II.,A purple path to long ago!
592,PART II.,
593,PART II.,"She saw the creole's large, dark eyes"
594,PART II.,Glance up to his in mute surprise;
595,PART II.,She saw him leave the girl and stand
596,PART II.,Before her with an outstretched hand.
597,PART II.,
598,PART II.,"Then turned and fled--no matter where,"
599,PART II.,So those she fled from were not there--
600,PART II.,"Seaward away, across the strand,"
601,PART II.,Where hungry waves crept up the sand.
602,PART II.,
603,PART II.,"On Memory's scroll there came a blot,"
604,PART II.,A space of time remembered not;
605,PART II.,"When sense awoke, clouds late aglow"
606,PART II.,"With sunset fire, looked drifts of snow."
607,PART II.,
608,PART II.,"For, like a disembodied soul"
609,PART II.,By angels clad in silvery stole
610,PART II.,And shining sandals for its flight
611,PART II.,"Along the upward paths of light,"
612,PART II.,
613,PART II.,"The moon had risen there, and turned"
614,PART II.,"Volcanic cloud-peaks while they burned,"
615,PART II.,White as the frozen coronet
616,PART II.,On Jura's misty forehead set.
617,PART II.,
618,PART II.,"And where, from out her casket fine,"
619,PART II.,"Eve had dropped rubies on the brine,"
620,PART II.,In gleaming lengths of shimmering sheen
621,PART II.,Long lines of moonlight paved the green.
622,PART II.,
623,PART II.,"Yet not to star, or sea, or skies"
624,PART II.,"She gazed, but into deep, dear eyes"
625,PART II.,"Bending upon her with the glow,"
626,PART II.,"The old, sweet love of long ago."
627,PART II.,
628,PART II.,"Subtly it thrilled through every vein,"
629,PART II.,Making her white cheek flush again;
630,PART II.,"As pale hydrangeas blushing shine,"
631,PART II.,Whose roots are steeped in purple wine.
632,PART II.,
633,PART II.,"She felt love's subtle, potent charm"
634,PART II.,Binding her on that strong right arm;
635,PART II.,"'T was softer than the cold gray stone,"
636,PART II.,'T was sweeter thus than all alone.
637,PART II.,
638,PART II.,"One moment struggling to be free,"
639,PART II.,"She cried: ""Release me, Graham Lee;"
640,PART II.,For there is more to part us now
641,PART II.,"Than distance, death, or broken vow."""
642,PART II.,
643,PART II.,"""Daisy""--his voice was deep and clear--"
644,PART II.,"""Stay; would I dare to hold you here"
645,PART II.,"So near my heart, if unto you"
646,PART II.,That heart had ever been untrue?
647,PART II.,
648,PART II.,"""Perchance, had I not found you soon,"
649,PART II.,As yon gray cloud beside the moon
650,PART II.,"Is silver-lined,--that wore a crown"
651,PART II.,"Of glory when the sun went down,"
652,PART II.,
653,PART II.,"""My future might have worn at last"
654,PART II.,"A light, which, likened to the past,"
655,PART II.,Would be as yonder placid moon
656,PART II.,Unto the sumptuous suns of June.
657,PART II.,
658,PART II.,"""You thought me dead--I thought you lost;"
659,PART II.,"Our hearts have both been tempest tossed,"
660,PART II.,And never anchored since that hour
661,PART II.,When each defied the other's power.
662,PART II.,
663,PART II.,"""The stately creole by my side"
664,PART II.,Is my young sister--not my bride;
665,PART II.,"Earth holds one mate alone for me,"
666,PART II.,"One bride--say, Daisy, shall it be?"""
667,PART II.,
668,PART II.,"No blot on the horizon's verge,"
669,PART II.,"No black smoke hid the star, no surge"
670,PART II.,"Came up to fret the silent sea,"
671,PART II.,No answer came to Graham Lee.
672,PART II.,
673,PART II.,What need of words? From eye to eye
674,PART II.,How quick the magnet glances fly--
675,PART II.,Electric sparks from soul to soul--
676,PART II.,As magnets flash from pole to pole.
677,PART II.,
678,PART II.,"From noiseless waters, stealing slow,"
679,PART II.,The drooping white stalactites grow;
680,PART II.,"From noiseless drops stalagmites rise,"
681,PART II.,"Silent they meet, and crystallize."
682,PART II.,
683,PART II.,The overflowing loves that spring
684,PART II.,"From two proud natures meeting, cling"
685,PART II.,"In strong, pure bliss from heart to home,"
686,PART II.,As cavern spars from floor to dome.
