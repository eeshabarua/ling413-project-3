26,INTRODUCTION.,INTRODUCTION.
27,INTRODUCTION.,
28,INTRODUCTION.,
29,INTRODUCTION.,"""A ray has pierced me from the highest heaven--"
30,INTRODUCTION.,"I have believed in worth; and do believe."""
31,INTRODUCTION.,
32,INTRODUCTION.,"So runs Mr. Woolner's song, as it proceeds to show the issue of a noble"
33,INTRODUCTION.,"earthly love, one with the heavenly.  Its issue is the life of high"
34,INTRODUCTION.,"endeavour, wherein"
35,INTRODUCTION.,
36,INTRODUCTION.,"""They who would be something more"
37,INTRODUCTION.,"Than they who feast, and laugh and die, will hear"
38,INTRODUCTION.,"The voice of Duty, as the note of war,"
39,INTRODUCTION.,"Nerving their spirits to great enterprise,"
40,INTRODUCTION.,"And knitting every sinew for the charge."""
41,INTRODUCTION.,
42,INTRODUCTION.,"This Library is based on a belief in worth, and on a knowledge of the"
43,INTRODUCTION.,"wide desire among men now to read books that are books, which ""do,"" as"
44,INTRODUCTION.,"Milton says, ""contain a potency of life in them to be as active as that"
45,INTRODUCTION.,"soul whose progeny they are; nay, they do preserve as in a vial the"
46,INTRODUCTION.,"purest efficacy and extraction of that living intellect that bred them."""
47,INTRODUCTION.,"When, therefore, as now happens for the second time, a man of genius who"
48,INTRODUCTION.,has written with a hope to lift the hearts and minds of men by adding one
49,INTRODUCTION.,"more true book to the treasures of the land, honours us by such"
50,INTRODUCTION.,"recognition of our aim, and fellow-feeling with it, that he gives up a"
51,INTRODUCTION.,"part of his exclusive right to his own work, and offers to make it freely"
52,INTRODUCTION.,"current with the other volumes of our series,--we take the gift, if we"
53,INTRODUCTION.,"may dare to say so, in the spirit of the giver, and are the happier for"
54,INTRODUCTION.,such evidence that we are not working in vain.
55,INTRODUCTION.,
56,INTRODUCTION.,Such evidence comes in other forms: as in letters from remote readers in
57,INTRODUCTION.,"lonely settlements, from the far West, from sheep-farms in Australia,"
58,INTRODUCTION.,"from farthest India, from places to which these little volumes make their"
59,INTRODUCTION.,way as pioneers; being almost the first real books that have there been
60,INTRODUCTION.,"seen.  To send a true voice over, for delight and support of earnest"
61,INTRODUCTION.,workers who open their hearts wide to a good book in a way that we can
62,INTRODUCTION.,"hardly understand,--we who live wastefully in the midst of plenty, and"
63,INTRODUCTION.,are apt sometimes to leave to feed on the fair mountain and batten on the
64,INTRODUCTION.,"moor,--is worth the while of any man of genius who puts his soul into his"
65,INTRODUCTION.,"work, as Mr. Woolner does."
66,INTRODUCTION.,
67,INTRODUCTION.,"Books in the ""National Library"" that come like those of Mr. Patmore and"
68,INTRODUCTION.,Mr. Woolner are here as friends and companions.  If they were not
69,INTRODUCTION.,esteemed highly they would not be here.  Beyond that implied opinion
70,INTRODUCTION.,there is nothing to be said.  He would be an ill-bred host who criticised
71,INTRODUCTION.,"his guest, or spoke loud praise of him before his face.  Nor does a well-"
72,INTRODUCTION.,"known man of our own day need personal introduction.  It is only said, in"
73,INTRODUCTION.,consideration that this book will be read by many who cannot know what is
74,INTRODUCTION.,"known to those who have access to the works of artists, that Mr. Thomas"
75,INTRODUCTION.,"Woolner is a Royal Academician, and one of the foremost sculptors of our"
76,INTRODUCTION.,"day.  For a couple of years, from 1877 to 1879, he was Professor of"
77,INTRODUCTION.,Sculpture at the Royal Academy.  A colossal statue by him in bronze of
78,INTRODUCTION.,Captain Cook was designed for a site overlooking Sydney Harbour.  A
79,INTRODUCTION.,"poet's mind has given life to his work on the marble, and when he was an"
80,INTRODUCTION.,"associate with Mr. Millais, Mr. Holman Hunt, and others, who, in 1850,"
81,INTRODUCTION.,"were endeavouring to bring truth and beauty of expression into art, by"
82,INTRODUCTION.,the bold reaction against tame and insincere conventions for which Mr.
83,INTRODUCTION.,"Ruskin pleaded and which the time required, Mr. Woolner joined in the"
84,INTRODUCTION.,"production by them of a magazine called ""The Germ,"" to which some of the"
85,INTRODUCTION.,verses in this volume were contributed.
86,INTRODUCTION.,
87,INTRODUCTION.,There is no more to say; but through another page let Wordsworth speak
88,INTRODUCTION.,the praise of Books:
89,INTRODUCTION.,
90,INTRODUCTION.,Yet is it just
91,INTRODUCTION.,"That here, in memory of all books which lay"
92,INTRODUCTION.,"Their sure foundations in the heart of man,"
93,INTRODUCTION.,"Whether by native prose, or numerous verse."
94,INTRODUCTION.,That in the name of all inspired souls--
95,INTRODUCTION.,"From Homer the great thunderer, from the voice"
96,INTRODUCTION.,"That roars along the bed of Jewish song,"
97,INTRODUCTION.,"And that more varied and elaborate,"
98,INTRODUCTION.,Those trumpet tones of harmony that shake
99,INTRODUCTION.,"Our shores in England--from those loftiest notes,"
100,INTRODUCTION.,"Down to the low and wren-like warblings, made"
101,INTRODUCTION.,For cottagers and spinners at the wheel
102,INTRODUCTION.,And sunburnt travellers resting their tired limbs
103,INTRODUCTION.,"Stretched under wayside hedgerows, ballad tunes"
104,INTRODUCTION.,Food for the hungry ears of little ones
105,INTRODUCTION.,And of old men who have survived their joys--
106,INTRODUCTION.,"'Tis just that in behalf of these, the works,"
107,INTRODUCTION.,"And of the men that framed them, whether known"
108,INTRODUCTION.,"Or sleeping nameless in their scattered graves,"
109,INTRODUCTION.,"That I should here assert their rights, attest"
110,INTRODUCTION.,"Their honours, and should, once for all, pronounce"
111,INTRODUCTION.,Their benediction; speak of them as Powers
112,INTRODUCTION.,"For ever to be hallowed; only less,"
113,INTRODUCTION.,"For what we are and what we may become,"
114,INTRODUCTION.,"Than Nature's self, which is the breath of God,"
115,INTRODUCTION.,Or His pure Word by miracle revealed.

124,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,
125,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,
126,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,In some there lies a sorrow too profound
127,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,To find a voice or to reveal itself
128,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Throughout the strain of daily toil, or thought,"
129,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Or during converse born of souls allied,"
130,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,As aught men understand.  And though mayhap
131,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Their cheeks will thin or droop; and wane their eyes'
132,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Frank lustre; hair may lose its hue, or fall;"
133,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,And health may slacken low in force; and they
134,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Are older than the warrant of their years;
135,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Yet they to others seem to gild their lives
136,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"With cheerfulness, and every duty tend,"
137,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,As if their aspects told the truth within.
138,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,But they are not as others: not for them
139,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"The bounding pulse, and ardour of desire,"
140,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,The rapture and the wonder in things new;
141,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,The hope that palpitating enters where
142,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Perfection smiles on universal life;
143,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Nor do they with elastic enterprise
144,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Forecast delight in compassing results;
145,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Nor, having won their ends, fall godlike back"
146,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,And taste the calm completion of content.
147,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,But in a sober chilled grey atmosphere
148,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Work out their lives; more various though they are
149,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Than creatures in the unknown ocean depths,"
150,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Yet each in whom this vital grief has root
151,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Is dull to what makes everything of worth.
152,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"And though, may be, a shallow bodily joy"
153,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Oft tingles through them at the breathing spring,"
154,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Or first-heard exultation of the lark;
155,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Still that deep weight draws ever steadily
156,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Their thoughts and passions back to secret woe.
157,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Though, if endowed with light, heroic deeds"
158,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,May be achieved; and if benignly bent
159,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,They may be treasured blessings through their lives;
160,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Yet power and goodness are to them as dreams,"
161,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"And they heed vaguely, if their waking sight"
162,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Be met with slanting storm against the pane,"
163,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Or sunshine glittering on the leaves that play
164,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,In purest blue of breezy summer morns.
165,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,
166,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Whence springs this well of mournfulness profound,"
167,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Unfathomable to plummet cast by man?
168,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Alas; for who can tell!  Whence comes the wind
169,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Heaving the ocean into maddened arms
170,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"That clutch and dash huge vessels on the rocks,"
171,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"And scatter them, as if compacted slight"
172,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,As little eggs boys star against a tree
173,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"In wanton mischief?  Whence, detestable,"
174,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"To man, who suffers from the monster-jaws,"
175,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,The power that in the logging crocodiles'
176,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Outrageous bulk puts evil fire of life?
177,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,That spouts from mountain-pyramids a flood
178,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Of lava, overwhelming works and men"
179,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"In burning, fetid ruin?--The power that stings"
180,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,A city with a pestilence: or turns
181,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"The pretty babe, who in his mother's lap"
182,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Babbles her back the lavished kiss and laugh,"
183,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Through lusts and vassalage to obdurate sin,"
184,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Into a knife-armed midnight murderer?
185,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,
186,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Our lives are mysteries, and rarely scanned"
187,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,As we read stories writ by mortal pen.
188,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,We can perchance but catch a straying weft
189,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"And trace the hinted texture here or there,"
190,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Of that stupendous loom weaving our fates.
191,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Two parents, late in life, are haply blessed"
192,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"With one bright child, a wonder in his years,"
193,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,For loveliness and genius versatile:
194,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Some common ill destroys him; parents, both,"
195,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Until their death, are left but living tombs"
196,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,That hold the one dead image of their joy.
197,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"A man, the flower of honour, who has found"
198,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"His well-beloved young daughter fled from home,"
199,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Fallen from her maidenhood, a nameless thing"
200,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Tainting his blood.  A youth who throws the strength
201,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Of his whole being into love for one
202,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Answering him honeyed smiles, and leaves his land"
203,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"For some far country, seeking wealth he hopes"
204,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Will grace her daintily with choice delights,"
205,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,And on returning sees the honeyed smiles
206,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Are sweetening other lips.  A husband who
207,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Has found that household curse, a faithless wife."
208,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,A thinker whose far-piercing care perceives
209,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,His nation goes the road that ends in shame.
210,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,A gracious woman whose reserve denies
211,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,The power to utter what consumes her heart.
212,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Such instances (and some a loss to know,"
213,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Which steadfast reticence will shield from those,"
214,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Debased or garrulous, whose hearts corrupt,"
215,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,But learn the gloomy secrets of their kind
216,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"To poison-tip their wit, or grope and grin"
217,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,With pharisaic laughter at disgrace)--
218,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Such instances as these demand no guide
219,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,To thrid the dismal issues from their source!
220,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"But others are there, lying fast concealed,"
221,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Dark, hopeless, and unutterably sad,"
222,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Which have not been, and never may be known."
223,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,
224,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Then we may well call happy one whose grief,"
225,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Mixed up with sacred memories of the past,"
226,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Can tell to others how the tempest rose,"
227,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,That struck and left him lonely in the world;
228,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"And who, narrating, feels his sorrow soothed,"
229,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,By that respect which love and sorrow claim.
230,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,
231,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"It much behoves us all, but chiefly those"
232,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Whom fate has favoured with an easy trust,"
233,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,To keep a bridle upon restless speech
234,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,And thought: and not in flagrant haste prejudge
235,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,The first presentment as the rounded truth.
236,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"For true it is, that rapid thoughts, and freak"
237,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Of skimming word, and glance, more frequently"
238,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Than either malice, settled hate, or scorn,"
239,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Support confusion, and pervert the right;"
240,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Set up the weakling in the strong man's place;
241,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,And yoke the great one's strength to idleness;
242,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Pour gold into the squanderer's purse, and suck"
243,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"The wealth, which is a power, from their control"
244,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Who would have turned it unto noble use.
245,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"And oftentimes a man will strike his friend,"
246,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"By random verbiage, with sharper pain"
247,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Than could a foe, yet scarcely mean him wrong;"
248,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,For none can strip this complex masquerade
249,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,And know who languishes with secret wounds.
250,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"They whom the brunt of war has maimed in limb,"
251,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Who lean on crutches to sustain their weight,"
252,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Are manifest to all; and reverence
253,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,For their misfortunes kindly gains them place:
254,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"But wounds, sometimes more deep and dangerous,"
255,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"We may in careless jostle through the crowd,"
256,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Gall and oppress, because to us unknown."
257,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Then, howsoever by our needs impelled,"
258,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Let us resolve to move in gentleness;
259,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Judge mildly when we doubt; and pause awhile
260,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Before injustice palpably proclaimed
261,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Ere we let fall the judgment stroke: against
262,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Their ignominious craft, who ever wait"
263,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"To filch another's right, we will maintain"
264,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Majestic peace in silence; knowing well
265,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Their craft takes something richer from themselves.
266,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,It is but seemly to respect the great;
267,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,But never let us fail toward lowly ones;
268,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Respecting more, in that they lack the force"
269,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,To claim it of the world.  For souls there are
270,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Of poor capacities, whose purpose holds,"
271,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"Throughout their unregarded lives, a worth,"
272,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,"And earnest law of fixed integrity,"
273,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,That were an honour even unto those
274,MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.  INTRODUCTION.,Whose genius marks the boundaries of our race.

286,LOVE.,"Bewildered in some outland waste, and lost:"
287,LOVE.,"Who, lonely faint and shuddering, through the night"

289,LOVE.,Of tempests on the wind.
290,LOVE.,
291,LOVE.,Auroral joy
292,LOVE.,"Flushes the brow of childhood, warms his cheek"
293,LOVE.,To rosier redness at the name of Love;
294,LOVE.,And earlier thoughts awake in darkness strive;

307,LOVE.,
308,LOVE.,"Man, nerved by Love, can steadily endure"
309,LOVE.,Clash of opposing interests; perplexed web
310,LOVE.,Of crosses that distracting clog advance:

318,LOVE.,"A lissom boy, whence comes that brooding smile,"

320,LOVE.,His sight with tender dew?  What through his frame
321,LOVE.,Melts languor sweeter than approaching sleep
322,LOVE.,To one made weary by a hard day's toil?
323,LOVE.,"It is the memory of primal love,"
324,LOVE.,Whose visionary splendour steeped his life
325,LOVE.,"In hues of heaven; and which grown open day,"
326,LOVE.,"Revealing perilous falls, his steps confined"
327,LOVE.,Within the pathways to the noblest end.
328,LOVE.,"Now following this dimmed glory, tired, his soul"
329,LOVE.,Haunts ever the mysterious gates of Death;
330,LOVE.,And waits in patient reverence till his doom
331,LOVE.,Unfolding them fulfils immortal Love.
332,LOVE.,
333,LOVE.,"As from some height, on a wild day of cloud,"
334,LOVE.,"A wanderer, chilled and worn, perchance beholds"
335,LOVE.,Move toward him through the landscape soaked in gloom
336,LOVE.,"A golden beam of light; creating lakes,"
337,LOVE.,"And verdant pasture, farms, and villages;"
338,LOVE.,And touching spires atop to flickering flame;
339,LOVE.,Disclosing herds of sober feeding kine;
340,LOVE.,And brightening on its way the woods to song;
341,LOVE.,"As he, that wanderer, brightens when the shaft"
342,LOVE.,"Suddenly falls on him.  A moment warmed,"
343,LOVE.,He scarcely feels its loveliness before
344,LOVE.,The light departing leaves his saddened soul
345,LOVE.,More cold than ere it came.
346,LOVE.,Thus love once shone
347,LOVE.,And blessed my life: so vanished into gloom.

354,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,"Her brow is wan, and bound by simple hair:"
355,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,"Her spirit sits aloof, and high,"

359,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,"As a young forest while the wind drives through,"

363,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,My longing with her voice.
364,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,
365,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,"Her warbling voice, though ever low and mild,"
366,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,Oft makes me feel as strong wine would a child:
367,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,And though her hand be airy light
368,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,"Of touch, it moves me with its might,"

372,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,"Tremble with might suppressed, before he dips,"
373,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,"In vigilance, hangs less intense"
374,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,"Than I, when her voice holds my sense"
375,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,Contented in suspense.
376,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,
377,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,"Her mention of a thing, august or poor,"
378,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,Makes it far nobler than it was before:
379,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,"As where the sun strikes life will gush,"
380,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,"And what is pale receive a flush,"
381,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,"Rich hues, a richer blush."

392,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,"Quivering in the flowing tide,"
393,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,By the deep river's side.
394,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,
395,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,"Fresh beauties, howsoe'er she moves, are stirred:"
396,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,As the sunned bosom of a humming bird
397,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,"At each pant lifts some fiery hue,"
398,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,"Fierce gold, bewildering green or blue;"
399,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,"The same, yet ever new."

413,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,How beautiful she is!  A glorious gem

442,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,
443,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,Or maybe that some thorn or prickly stem

483,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,Love's beauty on my sight.
484,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,
485,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,"For when we reached a hollow, where the stone"

503,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,"A lonely wind sighed up the pines, and sung"

506,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,"So bitter was I wished me dead,"
507,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,And from a great void said;

524,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,"Glowing with joy her smile to meet,"
525,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,And heap them round her feet!
526,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,
527,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,Her waist shook to my arm.  She bowed her head
528,I.  MY BEAUTIFUL LADY.,"To mine in silence, and my fears had fled:"

1176,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,
1177,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"""I, toiling at the task assigned to me,"

1193,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"Wrath-befooled, in my despair"
1194,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,
1195,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"I went, and, leaning from the lattice, mused"

1197,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"Heaven's King, that, like an earthly king, abused"

1200,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,
1201,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"Then glancing toward her danger thought, ""A cell"

1206,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,
1207,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"""But I unworthy!  How in conscience I--"

1218,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,
1219,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,This shameful mockery of myself alone
1220,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,Was interrupted by a sobbing moan

1223,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,Eyelids closing from the light.
1224,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,
1225,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"Ah, coarse, hard, bitter, brutal self!  A beast"
1226,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"In passion, nay far worse than such, to feast"
1227,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,On baseless anger against her whose least

1229,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,Interest in another's good.
1230,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,
1231,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"My passion then, like an unruly horse"

1249,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"We met each other, as when waters meet"

1252,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,That changing time may not dissever;
1253,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,One in love and one for ever.
1254,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,
1255,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"Purged by remorse, love knit my strength; and now"
1256,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,Came gracious power to still upon her brow
1257,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,Those troubled waves of some dark underflow;
1258,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,Her soul victorious over pain
1259,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,Spoke in golden smiles again.
1260,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,
1261,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,We sat and read how Prospero closed his strife
1262,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"With evil, wrought his charm, and crowned his life"
1263,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,In making two fair beings man and wife:
1264,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,Of brave Count Gismond's happy lot;
1265,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,And the Lady of Shalott.
1266,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,

1270,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,Of all the worlds in heaven to me;
1271,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"Held her long, long, lingeringly:"
1272,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,
1273,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"And laying down more than my life, her weight;"
1274,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"Scarce kissed her pallid hands, then moved with great"

1276,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"But, ere my slow feet reached the door,"
1277,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"Turned and caught one last look more,"
1278,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,
1279,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,And awe-struck stood to see portentous loom
1280,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,From her large eyes full gazing through the gloom
1281,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"Love darkly wedded to eternal doom,"
1282,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,As she were gazing from the dead:
1283,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"Falling at her feet I said,"
1284,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,
1285,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"""Bless me, dear Love, bless me before I go;"
1286,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"With love divine a beam of comfort throw,"

1289,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"Worthy to behold your face."""
1290,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,
1291,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,She bowed her head in stately tenderness
1292,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"Low whispering as her hands my brow did press,"
1293,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"""I pray that He will your lone spirit bless,"
1294,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"And if to leave you be my fate,"
1295,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"Pray you for me while I wait."""
1296,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,
1297,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"A useless pang in her no more to wake,"
1298,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"I forced myself away, nor dared to take"

1300,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,My face had told of the distressed
1301,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,Swollen heart labouring in my breast.
1302,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,
1303,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"When in the outer air, I felt as one"
1304,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"Fresh startled from a dream, wherein the sun"
1305,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"Had dying left the earth a dingy, dun"
1306,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,Annihilation.  The nightjar
1307,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,Only thrilled the air afar:
1308,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,
1309,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,No other sound was there: a muffled breeze
1310,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"Crept in the shrubs, and shuddered up the trees,"
1311,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"Then sought the ghost-white vapour of the leas,"
1312,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,Where one long sheet of dismal cloud
1313,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,Swathed the distance in a shroud.
1314,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,
1315,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,A solitary eye of cold stern light
1316,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"Stared threateningly beyond the Western height,"
1317,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,Wrapped in the closing shadows of the night;
1318,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,And all the peaceful earth had slept
1319,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,But that eye stern vigil kept.
1320,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,
1321,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,I wandered wearily I knew not where;
1322,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"Up windy downs far-stretching, bleak and bare;"
1323,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,Through swamps that soddened under stagnant air;
1324,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"In blackest woods and brambled mesh,"
1325,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,Thorny bushes tore my flesh:
1326,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,
1327,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"Amid the ripening corn I heard it sigh,"
1328,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"Hollow and sad, as night crawled sluggishly:"
1329,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,Hollow and sadly sighed the corn while I
1330,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"Moved darkly in the midst, a blight"
1331,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,Darkening more the hateful night.
1332,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,
1333,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,My soul its hoarded secrets emptied on
1334,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"The vaulted gloom of night: old fancies shone,"
1335,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,And consecrated ancient hopes long gone;
1336,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"Old hopes that long had ceased to burn,"
1337,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"Gone, and never to return."
1338,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,
1339,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"No starlight pierced the dense vault over head,"
1340,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,And all I loved was passing or had fled:
1341,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,So on I wandered where the pathway led;
1342,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,And wandered till my own abode
1343,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,Spectral pale rose from the road.
1344,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,
1345,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,What time I gained my home I saw the morn

1350,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,
1351,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"I lay, and ever as my lids would close"
1352,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"In dull forgetfulness to slumberous doze,"
1353,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,Lone sounds of phantom tolling scared repose;
1354,IX.  TOLLING BELL.,"Till wearied nature, sore oppressed,"

1542,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,And beat the downy pride
1543,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Of dandelions, wide:"
1544,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"From speargrass, bowed with watery beads,"
1545,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"The wet uniting, drips"
1546,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,In sparkles off the tips:
1547,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,In mallow bloom the wild bee drops and feeds.
1548,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,
1549,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"No more she hears, where vines adorn"
1550,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Her window, on the boughs"
1551,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Birds chirrup an arouse:
1552,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Flies, buzzing, strengthening with the morn,"
1553,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,She will not hear again
1554,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,At random strike the pane:
1555,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,No more against the newly shorn
1556,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Grass edges will her gown
1557,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"In playful waves be thrown,"
1558,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,As she walks forth to view what flowers are born.
1559,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,
1560,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Nor ponder more those dark green rings
1561,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Stained quaintly on the lea,"
1562,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,To picture elfin glee;
1563,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"While through the grass a faint air sings,"
1564,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,And swarms of insects revel
1565,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Along the sultry level:
1566,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"No more will watch their brilliant wings,"
1567,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Now lightly dip, now soar,"
1568,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Then sink, and rise once more."
1569,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,My Lady's death makes dear these trivial things.
1570,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,
1571,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"One noon, within an oak's broad shade,"
1572,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Lost in delightful talk,"
1573,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,We rested from our walk.
1574,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Beyond the shadow, large and staid,"
1575,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Cows chewed with drowsy eye
1576,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Their cud complacently:
1577,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Elegant deer walked o'er the glade,"
1578,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Or stood with wide bright eyes
1579,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Gazing a short surprise;
1580,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,And up the fern slope nimble conies played.
1581,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,
1582,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,As rooks cawed labouring through the heat;
1583,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Each wing-flap seemed to make
1584,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Their weary bodies ache;
1585,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"And swallows, though so wildly fleet,"
1586,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Made breathless pauses there
1587,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,At something in the air.
1588,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,All disappeared: our pulses beat
1589,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Distincter throbs, and each"
1590,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Turned and kissed without speech,"
1591,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,She trembling from her mouth down to her feet.
1592,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,
1593,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Then, as I felt her bosom heave,"
1594,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,And listened to the din
1595,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Of joyous life within,"
1596,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Could I but in my heaven believe,"
1597,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Assured by that repose
1598,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Within my heart, and those"
1599,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Warm arms around my neck!  While eve
1600,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,In shadowy silence came
1601,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"And quenched the Western flame,"
1602,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,That lingered round her as if loth to leave.
1603,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,
1604,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Then told I in a whispered tone
1605,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Of that approaching time,"
1606,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,When merry peal and chime
1607,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Of marriage ringing should make known,"
1608,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,In crashes through the air
1609,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Exultingly we were
1610,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,By solemn rite each other's own:
1611,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"And she, confiding, meek,"
1612,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Against mine pressed her cheek,"
1613,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,And gave response in happy tears alone.
1614,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,
1615,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"No heed of time took we, because"
1616,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Those clanging bells had quite
1617,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Absorbed us in delight.
1618,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,A happiness so perfect awes
1619,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"The failing pulse and breath,"
1620,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Like the mute doom of death:
1621,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Then, in an instantaneous pause"
1622,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Flashed on my vacant eye
1623,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,A swift Eternity;
1624,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"And starting, as if clutched by demon-claws,"
1625,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,
1626,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Awakened from a dizzy swoon,"
1627,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,I felt appalling fears
1628,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"With ringings in my ears,"
1629,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,And wondered why the glaring moon
1630,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Swung round the dome of night
1631,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,With such stupendous might.
1632,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Next came, like the sweet air of June,"
1633,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,A treacherous calm suspense
1634,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"That bred a loathly sense,"
1635,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Some nameless ill would overwhelm us soon.
1636,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,
1637,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,She passed like summer flowers away.
1638,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Her aspect and her voice
1639,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Will never more rejoice,"
1640,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,For she lies hushed in cold decay.
1641,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Broken the golden bowl
1642,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Which held her hallowed soul:
1643,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,It was an idle boast to say
1644,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"""Our souls are as the same,"""
1645,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,And stings me now to shame:
1646,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Her spirit went, and mine did not obey."
1647,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,
1648,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"The black truth, with a fiery dart,"
1649,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Went hurtling through my thought,"
1650,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,When I beheld her brought
1651,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Whence she with life did not depart.
1652,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Her beauty by degrees
1653,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Sank, sharpened from disease:"
1654,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,The heavy sinking at her heart
1655,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Sucked hollows in her cheek,"
1656,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"And made her eyelids weak,"
1657,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Though oft they opened wide with sudden start.
1658,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,
1659,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,The Deathly Power in silence drew
1660,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,My Lady's life away.
1661,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"I watched, dumb for dismay,"
1662,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,The shock of thrills that quivered through
1663,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Her wasted frame, and shook"
1664,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"The meaning in her look,"
1665,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"As near, more near, the moment grew."
1666,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,O horrible suspense!
1667,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,O giddy impotence!
1668,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"I saw her features lax, and change their hue."
1669,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,
1670,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Her gaze, grown large with fate, was cast"
1671,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Where my mute agonies
1672,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Made sadder her sad eyes:
1673,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Her breath caught with short plucks and fast,"
1674,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Then one hot choking strain;
1675,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,She never breathed again.
1676,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,I had the look which was her last:
1677,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Her love, when breath was gone,"
1678,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"One moment lingering shone,"
1679,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Then slowly closed, and hope for ever passed."
1680,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,
1681,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,A dreadful tremour ran through space
1682,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,When first the mournful toll
1683,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Rang for My Lady's soul.
1684,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,The shining world was hell; her grace
1685,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Only the flattering gleam
1686,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,And mockery of a dream:
1687,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"Oblivion struck me like a mace,"
1688,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,And as a tree that's hewn
1689,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"I dropped, in a dead swoon,"
1690,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,And lay a long time cold upon my face.
1691,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,
1692,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Earth had one quarter turned before
1693,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,My miserable fate
1694,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Pressed down with its whole weight.
1695,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,My sense came back; and shivering o'er
1696,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,I felt a pain to bear
1697,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"The sun's keen cruel glare,"
1698,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Which shone not warm as heretofore;
1699,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,And never more its rays
1700,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,Will satisfy my gaze:
1701,I.  MY LADY IN DEATH.,"No more; no more; O, never any more."

1707,II.  DAY DREAM.,"What art thou whispering lowly to thy babe,"
1708,II.  DAY DREAM.,"O wan girl-mother, with Madonna lids"
1709,II.  DAY DREAM.,Downcast?  Why pressest thou so close his pale
1710,II.  DAY DREAM.,Geranium cheek to thy yet whiter breast?
1711,II.  DAY DREAM.,"Ah, doubtless sweet; to feel him draw the stream"
1712,II.  DAY DREAM.,That fills with strength his lily limbs!  And laughs
1713,II.  DAY DREAM.,"Thine own heart with his deeply dimpled laughter,"
1714,II.  DAY DREAM.,Answering straight thy dainty finger's touch?
1715,II.  DAY DREAM.,"And understandeth he that murmurous moan,"
1716,II.  DAY DREAM.,"Wherewith thou hushest, patting him to rest?"
1717,II.  DAY DREAM.,
1718,II.  DAY DREAM.,"What visions charm thy gaze, now resting wide"
1719,II.  DAY DREAM.,In settled sweet content?  Beholdest thou
1720,II.  DAY DREAM.,"Thy babe, now sprung a man, walk sunhazed slopes"
1721,II.  DAY DREAM.,With one lovelier than visions; lovely as
1722,II.  DAY DREAM.,"The truth, O Love, when thou dost smile on me?"
1723,II.  DAY DREAM.,"Or seest thou him still greater grown in might,"
1724,II.  DAY DREAM.,And stout of action marching on to reach
1725,II.  DAY DREAM.,"That changeful coloured flag, whose waving crests"
1726,II.  DAY DREAM.,"The glittering heights of fame, for which men pant;"
1727,II.  DAY DREAM.,Unmindful there what tempests rage and sweep;
1728,II.  DAY DREAM.,Alas; what dream has made that watery veil
1729,II.  DAY DREAM.,Hide thine eye's light from mine; even as a mist
1730,II.  DAY DREAM.,Passing between me and a harvest moon!
1731,II.  DAY DREAM.,And whence this shadowy wall that baulks my gaze?
1732,II.  DAY DREAM.,"Why fadest thou, thyself, in mist, O Love?"
1733,II.  DAY DREAM.,Whither hath fled thy babe--and where art thou?--
1734,II.  DAY DREAM.,Where am I?--Is it life--a dream--or death?
1735,II.  DAY DREAM.,
1736,II.  DAY DREAM.,"Ah me; alas, this crushing wretchedness!"
1737,II.  DAY DREAM.,And I a vainer fool than one who yearns
1738,II.  DAY DREAM.,Clutching at rainbows spanned across the sky!
1739,II.  DAY DREAM.,"Ah, hope diseased!  My spirit lured astray"
1740,II.  DAY DREAM.,By siren hope drifts hard by some dark fate:
1741,II.  DAY DREAM.,And hope alternating despair has mixed
1742,II.  DAY DREAM.,"My life so long with charnelled death, that I"
1743,II.  DAY DREAM.,"Can scarce resolve the present from my past,"
1744,II.  DAY DREAM.,Nor what might once have been from what is now.
1745,II.  DAY DREAM.,
1746,II.  DAY DREAM.,"Ah, Dearest! shall I never see thy face"
1747,II.  DAY DREAM.,Again: not ever; never any more?
1748,II.  DAY DREAM.,"I know that fancy was but naught, and one"
1749,II.  DAY DREAM.,Born of past hope: I know thy earthly form
1750,II.  DAY DREAM.,"Is mouldering in its tomb; but yet, O Love,"
1751,II.  DAY DREAM.,Thy spirit must dwell somewhere in this waste
1752,II.  DAY DREAM.,"Of worlds, that fill the overwhelming heavens"
1753,II.  DAY DREAM.,With light and motion; that could never die;
1754,II.  DAY DREAM.,And wilt thou not vouchsafe one beaming look
1755,II.  DAY DREAM.,To ease a lonely heart that beats in pain
1756,II.  DAY DREAM.,"For loss of thee, and only thee, O Love?"
1757,II.  DAY DREAM.,Or hast thou found in that pure life thou livest
1758,II.  DAY DREAM.,"My soul was an unworthy choice for thine,"
1759,II.  DAY DREAM.,And therefore takest no count of its despair?
1760,II.  DAY DREAM.,"And yet, yea verily, thy love was true;"
1761,II.  DAY DREAM.,I would not wrong thee with another thought:
1762,II.  DAY DREAM.,I would not enter at the gates of heaven
1763,II.  DAY DREAM.,By thinking else than that thy love was true.
1764,II.  DAY DREAM.,"But I obtain no response to my cries,"
1765,II.  DAY DREAM.,"Making within my soul all void, and cold,"
1766,II.  DAY DREAM.,And comfortless.
1767,II.  DAY DREAM.,"Ay, empty, as this grate,"
1768,II.  DAY DREAM.,"Of life, wherefrom the fire has well nigh fled,"
1769,II.  DAY DREAM.,Leaving but chasmed ugliness and ruin:
1770,II.  DAY DREAM.,And weak as faltering of these taper flames
1771,II.  DAY DREAM.,"Half sunken in their sockets, by whose gleam"
1772,II.  DAY DREAM.,"I see, though faintly, where my books stand ranged"
1773,II.  DAY DREAM.,Most mute; though sometime eloquent to me;
1774,II.  DAY DREAM.,And where my pictures hang with other forms
1775,II.  DAY DREAM.,Instinct from what I know: where friends portrayed
1776,II.  DAY DREAM.,Like ghosts loom on me from another world.
1777,II.  DAY DREAM.,"Then what remains, but, like a child worn out"
1778,II.  DAY DREAM.,"With weeping, that I sink me down to rest,"
1779,II.  DAY DREAM.,"To sleep, not dream--and if I could to die?"

1785,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,I had been sitting by her tomb
1786,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,In torpor one dark night;
1787,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,When fitful tremours shook the doom
1788,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"Of cold lethargic settled gloom,"
1789,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,That weighed upon my sight:
1790,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,
1791,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"And while I sat, and sickly heaves"
1792,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"Disturbed my spirit's sloth,"

1794,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"That hissing, tore and lashed the leaves"
1795,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,And lashed the undergrowth:
1796,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,
1797,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"It roared and howled, it raged about"
1798,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,With some determined aim;
1799,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"And storming up the night, brought out"
1800,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"The moon, that like a happy shout,"
1801,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"Called forth My Lady's name,"
1802,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,
1803,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,In sudden splendour on the stone.
1804,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"Then, for an instant, I"

1808,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,
1809,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"Oppressed with overwhelming weight,"
1810,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,Down fell the edifice;
1811,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"When touched, as by the hand of Fate,"
1812,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,My gloom was gone.  I felt my state
1813,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"So light, I sobbed for bliss."
1814,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,
1815,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"The loud winds, spent in seeking rest,"
1816,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,Dropped dead.  My fevered brow
1817,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,Drank coolness from the grass it pressed;
1818,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,And in my desolated breast
1819,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"A change began to grow,"
1820,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,
1821,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,While feeling those tears slowly drain
1822,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,The load of grief which had
1823,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"A sluggish curse within me lain,"
1824,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,Save when remembrance wrought my brain
1825,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,For vivid moments mad.

1827,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"My tears, as treasures of a wreck"

1830,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,And earth was my good mother's neck

1832,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,
1833,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"I rose at length, and felt a dense"

1836,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,A singing hush that pressed my sense

1845,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,Mine eyes I dared not try to raise;
1846,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,My Lady's beamed on me
1847,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"In fixed serenity of gaze,"

1850,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,
1851,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,A gasping lapse; and I was whirled

1853,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"In dizzy circles hugely hurled,"

1857,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"To one stupendous vortex-light,"

1862,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,
1863,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,The dumb sound in mine ears was burst

1869,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"Her voice in some translucent star,"
1870,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"Remote, beyond my sight,"

1872,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"And yet so strangely near to jar,"

1874,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,
1875,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"She sang a song.  She warbled low,"
1876,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,She did not sing in words;
1877,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"I felt it in my spirit glow,"
1878,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"And knew it, as with joy I know"

1881,III.  MY LADY'S VOICE FROM HEAVEN.,"But hard the task I undertake,"

2938,NELLY DALE.,The kine were white and smooth as silk

2945,NELLY DALE.,"Leaving our cottage gates at noon,"

2963,NELLY DALE.,"Some fancy kindled, and I began"
2964,NELLY DALE.,"To whistle ""Tom the Piper's Son,"""
2965,NELLY DALE.,"Wondering whether, when grown a man,"
2966,NELLY DALE.,"I should remain to plod, or plan,"
2967,NELLY DALE.,"As others about had always done,"
2968,NELLY DALE.,"Or to some wondrous country stray,"

2986,NELLY DALE.,Equal delight our silence next;
2987,NELLY DALE.,"Making-believe that you are vext,"

2998,NELLY DALE.,"As we went onward, all things seeming"
2999,NELLY DALE.,"Strange, and rich, and fair, while dreaming"
3000,NELLY DALE.,Transient glimpses of what alone
3001,NELLY DALE.,Is ever by great-winged angels known.
3002,NELLY DALE.,
3003,NELLY DALE.,We knew not whether you or I
3004,NELLY DALE.,First saw the splendid butterfly
3005,NELLY DALE.,Trembling about us as we turned
3006,NELLY DALE.,To watch how blue and crimson burned
3007,NELLY DALE.,In flashes 'twixt those blushing wings!
3008,NELLY DALE.,"Nelly, I see you watch the lark"

3010,NELLY DALE.,"We both watch till our sight grows dark,"
3011,NELLY DALE.,And wonder whither he is fled
3012,NELLY DALE.,In sapphire ether overhead.
3013,NELLY DALE.,"Tho' vanished, still his rapture rings"
3014,NELLY DALE.,"And thrills our bosoms, marching slow"

3018,NELLY DALE.,"A spider-web, in holly spun"
3019,NELLY DALE.,"With rainbow hues that net the sun,"
3020,NELLY DALE.,Making coy circles ere he alight
3021,NELLY DALE.,Entangled in the toil of death!
3022,NELLY DALE.,"Forward I spring, without my breath,"
3023,NELLY DALE.,"To see the fiend, high-elbowed, whirl"
3024,NELLY DALE.,"Around those limbs and wings, and twirl"
3025,NELLY DALE.,His thread to thwart the chance of flight.
3026,NELLY DALE.,"Fate on a single instant hangs,"
3027,NELLY DALE.,And ready the demon's eager fangs
3028,NELLY DALE.,To penetrate that sylphic breast!
3029,NELLY DALE.,Nipping the wing-tips gently I
3030,NELLY DALE.,Flirt him from danger suddenly;
3031,NELLY DALE.,"Strike with my cap a rapid blow,"
3032,NELLY DALE.,Dashing the enemy down below
3033,NELLY DALE.,Thro' grass crushed safely into dust.
3034,NELLY DALE.,There shivering on my stretched forefinger
3035,NELLY DALE.,"A little while his terrors linger,"
3036,NELLY DALE.,"Doubting if yet his wings to trust,"
3037,NELLY DALE.,"Ere, with a bolder flap or two,"
3038,NELLY DALE.,He flutters into airy blue.
3039,NELLY DALE.,
3040,NELLY DALE.,"Could any mortal boy resist,"
3041,NELLY DALE.,"When heavenward, in a rosy pout"
3042,NELLY DALE.,Your lips you offered to be kissed;
3043,NELLY DALE.,Fresh as carnations breaking out
3044,NELLY DALE.,"Of dewy sheaths, on summer dawns"
3045,NELLY DALE.,Yet pale upon the misty lawns!
3046,NELLY DALE.,We pass from shadowy splendour soon
3047,NELLY DALE.,"To face the blazoned afternoon,"
3048,NELLY DALE.,Where wide around the basking sun
3049,NELLY DALE.,Lies on the meadow fast asleep.
3050,NELLY DALE.,"Near random bushes, one by one,"
3051,NELLY DALE.,"Nestled around a pond, the sheep"
3052,NELLY DALE.,Are scattered and doze in graceful shade;
3053,NELLY DALE.,"And hazed cornfields beyond the glade,"
3054,NELLY DALE.,"Undulating and dazzling sight,"
3055,NELLY DALE.,Seem quivering for predestined flight
3056,NELLY DALE.,To worlds of unrevealed delight.
3057,NELLY DALE.,"In lustrous sheen, their stately looks"
3058,NELLY DALE.,"Sedate as parsons reading books,"
3059,NELLY DALE.,"Flock grey-billed, see-saw-gaited rooks"
3060,NELLY DALE.,Strutting; or when they wings assume
3061,NELLY DALE.,"Pluck the warm air with fingered plume,"
3062,NELLY DALE.,"Labouring, anxious if weight and size"
3063,NELLY DALE.,Make flight most hazardous or wise!
3064,NELLY DALE.,Nelly we sauntered on and on
3065,NELLY DALE.,"By hedgerows, brightly overhung"
3066,NELLY DALE.,And sprinkled thick with snowy showers
3067,NELLY DALE.,Of woodbine stars; where bindweed flowers
3068,NELLY DALE.,"Ample and moon-white nobly shone,"
3069,NELLY DALE.,"And over green abysses slung,"
3070,NELLY DALE.,"Mid honey-haunted sound of bees,"
3071,NELLY DALE.,Swayed lightly to the scented breeze.
3072,NELLY DALE.,
3073,NELLY DALE.,"In passing starwort's silvery gems,"
3074,NELLY DALE.,"By maple's warm fawn-tinted stems,"
3075,NELLY DALE.,"Caprices that gnarled the oak and thorn,"
3076,NELLY DALE.,A sudden scream of rageful scorn
3077,NELLY DALE.,Startles us from the hedgerow nigh;
3078,NELLY DALE.,Whence two disturbed fierce blackbirds fly
3079,NELLY DALE.,Uttering threats of vengeance dire!
3080,NELLY DALE.,"While we, who lit this angry fire,"
3081,NELLY DALE.,Are wondering such discordant throats
3082,NELLY DALE.,Can tune those soft melodious notes
3083,NELLY DALE.,"The fondest lover's listening ear,"
3084,NELLY DALE.,"At even, turns entranced to hear!"
3085,NELLY DALE.,
3086,NELLY DALE.,But if I sang of every sight
3087,NELLY DALE.,"That afternoon which gave delight,"
3088,NELLY DALE.,Those treasures would my numbers throng
3089,NELLY DALE.,Beyond the compass of my song;
3090,NELLY DALE.,"Therefore, Nelly, to be precise,"
3091,NELLY DALE.,"We bought the milk, and paid the price"
3092,NELLY DALE.,Charged in that rural paradise.
3093,NELLY DALE.,"The rolls of butter, the jars of cream,"
3094,NELLY DALE.,"Churn, and cleanly pans, now seem,"
3095,NELLY DALE.,"Thro' fifty years of vanished time,"
3096,NELLY DALE.,The memories of a nursery rhyme;
3097,NELLY DALE.,"Or story, like The ""Babes in the Wood,"""
3098,NELLY DALE.,Written for children to make them good.
3099,NELLY DALE.,
3100,NELLY DALE.,Homeward we went in soberer mood;
3101,NELLY DALE.,"Haply the weight we had to carry,"
3102,NELLY DALE.,By stile and gate oft made us tarry
3103,NELLY DALE.,"To change our hands, and ease the weight"
3104,NELLY DALE.,By making both co-operate.
3105,NELLY DALE.,"At length we knew the hour grew late,"
3106,NELLY DALE.,"Because we saw our shadows rise,"
3107,NELLY DALE.,"Mocking our motions, thrice our size;"
3108,NELLY DALE.,"And keeping faithful phantom pace,"
3109,NELLY DALE.,Tempting us to an elfin race
3110,NELLY DALE.,For fairy treasure; all in play!
3111,NELLY DALE.,"For which, whatever they might say,"
3112,NELLY DALE.,We knew our lives would have to pay!
3113,NELLY DALE.,Both breaking into prattle showed
3114,NELLY DALE.,How pleased we trod the dusty road
3115,NELLY DALE.,Once more; and rested where the rill
3116,NELLY DALE.,"Sings issuing, halfway up the hill;"
3117,NELLY DALE.,Where maids and wives their pitchers bring
3118,NELLY DALE.,"To fill, and gossip at the spring."
3119,NELLY DALE.,"To gossip ourselves we durst not stop,"
3120,NELLY DALE.,As we had yet to reach the top
3121,NELLY DALE.,"Where, starting from before the moon,"
3122,NELLY DALE.,"Our church spire quickened, rose, and danced"
3123,NELLY DALE.,"Higher and higher as we advanced,"
3124,NELLY DALE.,"And on a sudden ceased, as soon"
3125,NELLY DALE.,"As we were on the level; then,"
3126,NELLY DALE.,There your mother stood at the gate
3127,NELLY DALE.,Impatient we were out so late;
3128,NELLY DALE.,"Inquiring how, and why, and when;"
3129,NELLY DALE.,"She thought we had been drowned, and lost,"
3130,NELLY DALE.,And by some savage mad bull tossed;
3131,NELLY DALE.,So long had she been looking out!
3132,NELLY DALE.,Whatever had we been about?
3133,NELLY DALE.,"Altho' we saw so much that day,"
3134,NELLY DALE.,"But little then had we to say,"
3135,NELLY DALE.,And told her a bewildered tale
3136,NELLY DALE.,Of garment torn by splintered rail;
3137,NELLY DALE.,"Of spiders, blackbirds, butterflies;"
3138,NELLY DALE.,Of rooks so near that looked so wise!
3139,NELLY DALE.,"Of ghostly shadows, some of the way,"
3140,NELLY DALE.,"That had been tempting us to play,"
3141,NELLY DALE.,Tho' sure they must have known we should
3142,NELLY DALE.,Be making all the haste we could!
3143,NELLY DALE.,"The gentle scolding given and past,"
3144,NELLY DALE.,We bade each other good-night at last
3145,NELLY DALE.,When floating in the stillness by
3146,NELLY DALE.,"Came sounds like ""late,"" and ""supper,"" and ""bed;"""
3147,NELLY DALE.,And brighter through a deepening sky
3148,NELLY DALE.,"A million stars shone o'er my head,"
3149,NELLY DALE.,And bats flew fast and silently.
3150,NELLY DALE.,
3151,NELLY DALE.,"When memory wings her way to you,"
3152,NELLY DALE.,I nurse my faith to think it true
3153,NELLY DALE.,"For one day, Nelly, you were mine!"
3154,NELLY DALE.,"Ah, Dearest, had that day divine"
3155,NELLY DALE.,Made us two one for good and all!
3156,NELLY DALE.,"The nursery words I now recall,"
3157,NELLY DALE.,"Of Tom the Piper's Son's one tune,"
3158,NELLY DALE.,"Mused over in that day of June,"
3159,NELLY DALE.,Have proved the prelude to my fate!
3160,NELLY DALE.,We were not fashioned to translate
3161,NELLY DALE.,Each other's will as man and wife:
3162,NELLY DALE.,"And tho' I was not broken-hearted,"
3163,NELLY DALE.,"As Burns when from his Mary parted,"
3164,NELLY DALE.,And fled the fragrance of his life;
3165,NELLY DALE.,Yet are you near and dear to me!
3166,NELLY DALE.,For on the bridge below the hill
3167,NELLY DALE.,I see you smile as sweetly still;
3168,NELLY DALE.,And in your clear wide-opened eyes
3169,NELLY DALE.,The spacious wonder of the skies.
3170,NELLY DALE.,While every thoughtful dainty grace
3171,NELLY DALE.,"Rests well contented in your face,"
3172,NELLY DALE.,"All fascinations of the rose,"
3173,NELLY DALE.,Uniting in your presence close.
3174,NELLY DALE.,"Indeed, from glowing hair to feet,"
3175,NELLY DALE.,"So lightly poised, shaped so complete"
3176,NELLY DALE.,"You seem a being 'twixt a flower,"
3177,NELLY DALE.,"The glory of a shining hour,"
3178,NELLY DALE.,And one ordained to satisfy
3179,NELLY DALE.,The claims of immortality.
3180,NELLY DALE.,
3181,NELLY DALE.,"Your beauty, like a queen's or king's"
3182,NELLY DALE.,"Good word, gives price to common things:"
3183,NELLY DALE.,That can your ruddy fingers hold
3184,NELLY DALE.,Hangs lovelier there than purest gold;
3185,NELLY DALE.,"And, as the poor, grown rich by chance,"
3186,NELLY DALE.,"Run raptured in extravagance,"
3187,NELLY DALE.,My fancy riots in the fields'
3188,NELLY DALE.,Increasing wealth its charter yields:
3189,NELLY DALE.,"And at your lintel, by the bower"
3190,NELLY DALE.,Of vine leaves screening noonday heat;
3191,NELLY DALE.,"The grapes, that hang there small and sour,"
3192,NELLY DALE.,Are soft in bloom and more than sweet!
3193,NELLY DALE.,
3194,NELLY DALE.,"Beholding kittens as they play,"
3195,NELLY DALE.,"Black, tortoise, white, or silver grey;"
3196,NELLY DALE.,"Or ducklings on the water glide,"
3197,NELLY DALE.,"Yellow and soft, and artless eyed:"
3198,NELLY DALE.,"Or neatly-shapen chicks astray,"
3199,NELLY DALE.,Pecking incessantly on their way;
3200,NELLY DALE.,"Each such a trim completed creature,"
3201,NELLY DALE.,"In perfect movement, hue, and feature:"
3202,NELLY DALE.,A foolish sadness makes me sigh
3203,NELLY DALE.,They lack immutability.
3204,NELLY DALE.,"But you, my Nelly, are ever young."
3205,NELLY DALE.,Fresh and happy you dwell among
3206,NELLY DALE.,"The brightest flowers, and flourish where"
3207,NELLY DALE.,Meadows are ever fresh and fair.
3208,NELLY DALE.,"As you were then I see you now,"
3209,NELLY DALE.,Standing beneath an apple bough;
3210,NELLY DALE.,"Your face amid its blossoms, bright"
3211,NELLY DALE.,"With rosy laughter and delight,"
3212,NELLY DALE.,You seem a blossom the partial sun
3213,NELLY DALE.,Has chosen to make a larger one.
3214,NELLY DALE.,
3215,NELLY DALE.,"What may your pilgrimage have been,"
3216,NELLY DALE.,"Since both of us lost our Eden days,"
3217,NELLY DALE.,I never rashly tried to glean;
3218,NELLY DALE.,And know not if your childhood ways
3219,NELLY DALE.,Were trodden by your maiden feet
3220,NELLY DALE.,"When, flushed and shy with hope and fear,"
3221,NELLY DALE.,You went your loitering swain to meet
3222,NELLY DALE.,And listen to sounds you loved to hear!
3223,NELLY DALE.,But if sometimes your heart was fain
3224,NELLY DALE.,Along our honeysuckle lane
3225,NELLY DALE.,"Again to roam, in gracious flight"
3226,NELLY DALE.,Your memory would have found delight
3227,NELLY DALE.,In wandering there a child again!
3228,NELLY DALE.,"And if a matron you became,"
3229,NELLY DALE.,With a matron's worries and daily strife;
3230,NELLY DALE.,"The pain and sorrow, the hurt and blame"
3231,NELLY DALE.,"Mixed with pleasure, of being a wife,"
3232,NELLY DALE.,"I know not.  But of this am sure,"
3233,NELLY DALE.,"That if with daughters you were blessed,"
3234,NELLY DALE.,"They found your bright example lure,"
3235,NELLY DALE.,"Thro' ways by wisdom proven best,"
3236,NELLY DALE.,"And sympathetic, generous trust"
3237,NELLY DALE.,To kindly conduct more than just.
3238,NELLY DALE.,"If old experience yet holds true,"
3239,NELLY DALE.,And by a generation's lapse
3240,NELLY DALE.,"Your daughter's child resembles you,"
3241,NELLY DALE.,Then by that happy law perhaps
3242,NELLY DALE.,Another Nelly may be seen
3243,NELLY DALE.,To grace some other village green;
3244,NELLY DALE.,As native there as morning dew;
3245,NELLY DALE.,"Or larks aloft, when lost to view"
3246,NELLY DALE.,They lift us thro' the trembling blue
3247,NELLY DALE.,To soar with them in ecstasy;
3248,NELLY DALE.,"Or primroses, whose welcome faces"
3249,NELLY DALE.,"From sunny banks and shady places,"
3250,NELLY DALE.,Tenderly glimmer in pallid gold
3251,NELLY DALE.,"Caught as early morning broke,"
3252,NELLY DALE.,"When, dreaming daylight they awoke"
3253,NELLY DALE.,Enamoured from the moistened mold.
3254,NELLY DALE.,"And if a Nelly, tho' changed in name,"
3255,NELLY DALE.,Her fair endowments will the same
3256,NELLY DALE.,Point every grace that charmed before
3257,NELLY DALE.,"Thro' unrenowned ancestresses,"
3258,NELLY DALE.,Then still there beams a joy that blesses
3259,NELLY DALE.,The traveller by your cottage door;
3260,NELLY DALE.,"Who, pleased in after years to trace"
3261,NELLY DALE.,"Remembrance of your playful face,"
3262,NELLY DALE.,May linger on your presence while
3263,NELLY DALE.,Before him still you turn to smile.
