69,ARGUMENT,"In this Threnody and Birth-song of the Elements, written in"
70,ARGUMENT,"California some five years ago, I have striven to capture"
71,ARGUMENT,and present some of the chief-factors and phases of the
72,ARGUMENT,"eternal drama of Life and Death in the Universe. These powers,"
73,ARGUMENT,elements and agents I have endowed with human attributes
74,ARGUMENT,and human emotions as though it were Man himself who uttered
75,ARGUMENT,himself through them.
76,ARGUMENT,
77,ARGUMENT,The actors in this cosmic masque or pageant of the planets
78,ARGUMENT,"are the Sun, the Moon and the Earth with her four Elements;"
79,ARGUMENT,for stage there is the limitless background of Time and
80,ARGUMENT,"Space, and the audience may be conceived as being represented"
81,ARGUMENT,"by Immanent Nature. Creation and Dissolution are her ministers,"
82,ARGUMENT,twin forces of that divine everlasting Energy which brings
83,ARGUMENT,to pass the cycles of the Eternal Recurrence.
84,ARGUMENT,
85,ARGUMENT,The action takes its course with a certain regard for the
86,ARGUMENT,"laws and revelations of Science, but this compliance is only"
87,ARGUMENT,such as poetry need observe. Despite the inherent and mystic
88,ARGUMENT,"majesty of Matter,--too commonly reviled!--fantasy must have"
89,ARGUMENT,"leave, in such a work, to force its way past the barrier of"
90,ARGUMENT,facts or to reshape them to its needs.
91,ARGUMENT,
92,ARGUMENT,Whether the action begin with the impulse of Dissolution or
93,ARGUMENT,with that of Creation does not in any way affect the essentials
94,ARGUMENT,"of the plan. The alternations of Life and Death, of Cosmic Night"
95,ARGUMENT,"and Day, must inevitably follow and destroy each other, like"
96,ARGUMENT,the serpents in the ancient symbol. Yet I thought it desirable
97,ARGUMENT,to end this work with the larger and salient note of hope and
98,ARGUMENT,joy that rings out of the Birth that is Re-birth rather than with
99,ARGUMENT,the Passing which is but a recurrent preparation for that Birth.

107,THE PASSING,
108,THE PASSING,The song of the Spirit of Chaos is heard on high above the aged
109,THE PASSING,Solar Universe.
110,THE PASSING,
111,THE PASSING,The Sun hangs in the black wastes below. His dazzling beams are
112,THE PASSING,"shorn away. He glows, but dimly, like an ember, with a red and"
113,THE PASSING,smouldering heat.
114,THE PASSING,
115,THE PASSING,"In their concentric rounds lie poised the planets, like weary-winged"
116,THE PASSING,"cup-bearers, circling about their sleepless lord."
117,THE PASSING,
118,THE PASSING,"His fire, dull with death, wavers across their dim faces, even unto"
119,THE PASSING,"dusky Uranus and lowering Neptune in the cold, outermost rings."
120,THE PASSING,
121,THE PASSING,"In the dark, all-surrounding void new constellations gleam on the"
122,THE PASSING,"thrones of the heavens. The old are changed, deposed or dead."
123,THE PASSING,
124,THE PASSING,"Their figures, unfixed in the abyss, have been shifted like errant"
125,THE PASSING,sands of Earth.
126,THE PASSING,
127,THE PASSING,"The spirit of Chaos, from her uncharted tracts, summons her"
128,THE PASSING,ministrant powers of Death and Change. She beholds them blight
129,THE PASSING,the worlds. Her presence enfolds destroyers and destroyed as with
130,THE PASSING,a cloak.
131,THE PASSING,
132,THE PASSING,The dusks and damps of dissolution spread out their lethal and
133,THE PASSING,invisible wings.
134,THE PASSING,
135,THE PASSING,"The voice of the Spirit, like spheral music, flows out of the"
136,THE PASSING,darkness.
137,THE PASSING,
138,THE PASSING,The orbs listen and are filled with a miraculous consciousness
139,THE PASSING,and the soft lassitude of Death.

143,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS
144,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,
145,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,THE staring vessels of these worlds no wine
146,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,"Of Life refills, no seeds of potent change."
147,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,So may Death's pale and lingering weeds entwine
148,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,These hollow globes that still unhindered range
149,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,Through Heaven. O famished Time! thy jaws devour
150,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,"The suns and slumbers of the broken spheres,"
151,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,"Whose knell young stars have heard, whose rounded hour"
152,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,"Strikes, and is buried in thy bourneless years."
153,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,"They glow like fevered jewels in the deeps,"
154,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,"Like sullen embers in remorseless Night,"
155,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,Like flowers with'ring when the Winter creeps
156,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,With iron dews their little lives to blight.
157,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,Since recordless immensities of Time
158,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,I stand whose ne'er-sealed eyes the birth behold
159,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,"Of worlds dream-born,--their fiery infant clime,"
160,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,"Their teeming life, their epochs gray and cold,"
161,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,Peace kiss and blot their tarnished light and close
162,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,Their leaden urns with gentleness. I shed
163,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,"The ashes of my silence on their snows,--"
164,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,Then waft them to my kingdoms of the dead.
165,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,
166,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,Through the doomed Sun runs a tremor from core to crust. There is
167,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,a faltering in his flight.
168,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,
169,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,"His vassal globes roll on, disturbed and bleak."
170,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,
171,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,The Lord of Day shakes upon his central seat and turns up his
172,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,hectic front in dumb questionings of despair. He yearns for sleep
173,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,to seal his kingly eye.
174,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,
175,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,The calcined wounds upon him are like many mouths. They roll forth
176,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,trembling thunder.
177,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,
178,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,And now is heard the voice of the Sun in agony:

182,SONG OF THE SUN,SONG OF THE SUN
183,SONG OF THE SUN,
184,SONG OF THE SUN,WEARY am I at last! weary am I!
185,SONG OF THE SUN,Shall the old eons bring me no repose?
186,SONG OF THE SUN,"Oh, in long-promised slumbers once to lie"
187,SONG OF THE SUN,And feel the films of sleep mine eyelids close!
188,SONG OF THE SUN,"Oh, once to lave my burning head in Night--"
189,SONG OF THE SUN,Blest Night! my planets joy thee--every one!
190,SONG OF THE SUN,"Perish, fatigueless Fire! and thou, O Light!"
191,SONG OF THE SUN,"Vanish. Go leave your emperor, your Sun!"
192,SONG OF THE SUN,For I am done with blessings scattered wide
193,SONG OF THE SUN,"Throughout the waste, oppressive Universe,"
194,SONG OF THE SUN,"And yonder fading Earth-globe, once my bride,"
195,SONG OF THE SUN,Becomes to me a burden and a curse.
196,SONG OF THE SUN,"No more she smiles for me, no more my rays"
197,SONG OF THE SUN,"Urge on her frozen roots to coloured bloom,"
198,SONG OF THE SUN,"No clouds enrobe her nakedness--her days,"
199,SONG OF THE SUN,"Once golden in the dance, are bent on doom."
200,SONG OF THE SUN,"A loathing throngs the vision, and the face"
201,SONG OF THE SUN,"Of Man is stone and ashen, fallen supine."
202,SONG OF THE SUN,How long with Light and Love I warmed his race!
203,SONG OF THE SUN,Now iron crowns of Ruin and Death be mine.
204,SONG OF THE SUN,
205,SONG OF THE SUN,The Earth-orb and her four elements are locked in the arms of
206,SONG OF THE SUN,decay.
207,SONG OF THE SUN,
208,SONG OF THE SUN,"She, like a stricken mother, bereaved of all beloved things, calls"
209,SONG OF THE SUN,"on the Sun, her primal fount of Life."
210,SONG OF THE SUN,
211,SONG OF THE SUN,The saddest of all her twilights has fallen and is moving on
212,SONG OF THE SUN,to night.
213,SONG OF THE SUN,
214,SONG OF THE SUN,"Life, be it of man, or beast, or flower, is slowly quenched, as a"
215,SONG OF THE SUN,torch is quenched in a midnight lake.
216,SONG OF THE SUN,
217,SONG OF THE SUN,The haunts and habitations of men have vanished; they are not any
218,SONG OF THE SUN,more. Yet their ruins are heaped with snow that shall know no thawing.
219,SONG OF THE SUN,
220,SONG OF THE SUN,Every hour of Earth is an eon and her day has yet many hours.
221,SONG OF THE SUN,
222,SONG OF THE SUN,Her elements sing each their song. The parent Earth sends forth her
223,SONG OF THE SUN,cry into the void.
224,SONG OF THE SUN,
225,SONG OF THE SUN,
226,SONG OF THE SUN,
227,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH
228,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,
229,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,"NOT now thy beams arouse me morn by morn,"
230,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,O Sun! as when my flesh was warm and young.
231,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,Out of our love what children fair were born
232,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,To rapture! ere thy last wild song was sung.
233,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,I deem thy day is Night and thou the Moon--
234,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,"So feeble is thy kiss, so cold thy light,--"
235,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,"Lamp of my life, alas!--how soon, how soon--"
236,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,O speak! comes thy last greeting and good-night?
237,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,"My breasts are sere as sand, no flowers bloom,"
238,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,"No grass, no forests hide my misery bare;"
239,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,The reaches of the tyrannous poles consume
240,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,"Those gardens of delight we made so fair,"
241,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,"And men lie dark in caves, a sullen race,"
242,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,"Framed of ray daughter's flesh but now my bane,"
243,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,"Yet shall I not withdraw my patient face,"
244,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,Nor tomb them in my hollow caves of pain.
245,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,"Soon shall I creep no more about thee, orb"
246,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,"Of Heaven, for all my thews grow stark and dry."
247,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,"When the years drag me to my end--absorb,"
248,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,"Embrace, enfold, caress me, ere I die!"
249,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,
250,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,"A song fours down from the skies, a plangent song of triumph from"
251,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,"the Moon. Yet it is not her voice, but that of the Moon Wraith. She"
252,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,reigns in mockery and malice upon her peaks in gulfs of solitude.
253,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,
254,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,She sings for her who perished long ago. Her voice is flung
255,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,exulting over the ruins.
256,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,
257,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,The Phantasm turns the ashen sphere about the rusted poles.
258,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,
259,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,The mystery of the Moons invisible hemisphere is now revealed.
260,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,
261,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,It too is desolation.
262,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,
263,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,
264,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,
265,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH
266,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,
267,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,THEY are dying! all are dying! Night shall force
268,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,Us headlong through her shoreless regions blind.
269,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,"Then must I, an empty lamp, around the corse"
270,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,"Of Earth my dark, unending spirals wind."
271,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,"I loved the Sun. My heart was molten stone,"
272,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,"Like Earth my face for him with beauty bloomed,"
273,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,"Ere lust and hatred scarred my every zone,"
274,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,And passion tore my beauty and consumed.
275,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,"They are dying! I have waited lone and long,--"
276,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,"Long have hung, a warning skull that gleamed"
277,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,Above their feast of Life and Love;--their song
278,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,"Is ended, and the Sun sheds blood. They dreamed."
279,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,"Earth that called me cold and pale, grows pale and cold,--"
280,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,Now wearily her groaning axle turns
281,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,Those alternating glories that she rolled
282,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,To mock my ashen tombs and crater-urns!
283,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,No more her midnight ghouls nor lovers creep
284,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,To curse or bless my light; my shadow crawls
285,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,Like some dark moth upon her. I shall sleep
286,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,Equal with her in death. The tyrant falls!
287,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,
288,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,"The Element of Earth, waste and inert, hears at last the cry"
289,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,of the Mother-globe.
290,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,
291,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,"Her crests and peaks, her vales and plains, lie white and whelmed"
292,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,with snow.
293,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,
294,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,The mountain ranges draw their icy shrouds over the faces of dead
295,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,continents.
296,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,
297,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,"A convulsion seizes on her granite heart, and the lips of her"
298,SONG OF THE MOON WRAITH,hills are heard uttering their dirge.

303,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,
304,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"SPRUNG molten from the fierce embrace of stars,"
305,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,Graven by hungry seas and winds and fires--
306,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"Lo, my poor frame terrene with all its scars"
307,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,Lies arid like the dross of blasted pyres!
308,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"Opulent fields and fruits, and forest tracts--"
309,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"O fourfold largess of the seasons! grain,"
310,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,Once on this bosom waving! cataracts
311,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,Poured from my heart!--each precious living vein
312,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"Of gold or gleaming mineral, and flower"
313,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,And grass and mated creature that I gave
314,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"To man unstinted from my royal dower,"
315,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,Lie cold in this my never-sated grave.
316,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"And he, my noblest offspring, whom my breasts"
317,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"Suckled when ushered from my fertile womb,"
318,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"Lies low in dark and underearthen nests,"
319,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,Calling on slow and silent-footed doom.
320,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"No more, no more the joyous spring shall thaw"
321,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"These crystal cere-cloths from my withered heart,--"
322,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"No more shall Life his golden pageant draw,"
323,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,Nor ever a seed shall spring nor a flower start.
324,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,
325,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"The all-embracing and tender Air is without motion, lifeless"
326,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,and exhaust.
327,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,
328,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,His eight lordly sons lie undone in eight far regions of the globe.
329,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,
330,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,Thinner and thinner grows the element as it is drained away to
331,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,dissolution.
332,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,
333,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"Meteors from the outer vast pierce, unconsumed, the canopy of the"
334,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,dying Air. The helpless Earth is smitten with showers of fire-javelins.
335,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,
336,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,Sighs suffuse the atmosphere and putrescence rises with its legions
337,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,of leaden ghosts.
338,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,
339,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"What is this sound, so low, so faint, so thin? It seems like the"
340,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"first whisper of the youngest of all the Angels, or the last sigh"
341,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,of the oldest of all Men.
342,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,
343,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,It is the Song of the dying Air.

347,SONG OF AIR,SONG OF AIR
348,SONG OF AIR,
349,SONG OF AIR,DEAD! dark! flown! my primal happiness;
350,SONG OF AIR,The stark ice ribs my high and hollow cave.
351,SONG OF AIR,"The vortex of the World spins raptureless,"
352,SONG OF AIR,And languorously crawls the oily wave.
353,SONG OF AIR,From sun-shot peaks of dawn no more I leap
354,SONG OF AIR,"Like a launching condor past control,--"
355,SONG OF AIR,"O speak, Son of the West! if this be Sleep--"
356,SONG OF AIR,Or Death that is our destiny and goal?
357,SONG OF AIR,Thick torpor clouds the climes; eternal snow
358,SONG OF AIR,"Falling, falling, falling, throngs my realm."
359,SONG OF AIR,Shall nevermore my breath o'er Ocean blow?
360,SONG OF AIR,Nor wrestle with his seas that roar and whelm?
361,SONG OF AIR,"No balsam to the woods can I restore,"
362,SONG OF AIR,Nor render pure my breath for man to drain;
363,SONG OF AIR,I faint within his nostrils that implore
364,SONG OF AIR,My draught to rouse his drooping heart again.
365,SONG OF AIR,"My Earth that I enfolded like a bloom,"
366,SONG OF AIR,"Lies but a withered creature,--sterile, cold,--"
367,SONG OF AIR,"Hither, fly hither! O winds who share my doom,"
368,SONG OF AIR,"Oh, wail your dying sire whose days are told."
369,SONG OF AIR,
370,SONG OF AIR,A prone and expiring giant lifts up his bulk once more and
371,SONG OF AIR,would not die.
372,SONG OF AIR,
373,SONG OF AIR,"It is Ocean, usurper of Earth's deepest vales, besieger of islands,"
374,SONG OF AIR,batterer of continents.
375,SONG OF AIR,
376,SONG OF AIR,His great green front and land-fettered limbs glimmer up to his
377,SONG OF AIR,mistress Moon. His breast heaves unto her as of old with an
378,SONG OF AIR,awful and passionate longing.
379,SONG OF AIR,
380,SONG OF AIR,"But a film has veiled his eyes, and now stagnation builds up"
381,SONG OF AIR,her muddy pillars in his heart. There Death reigns amidst havoc.
382,SONG OF AIR,
383,SONG OF AIR,His leviathans and huge worms and wrecks of ships rot on every
384,SONG OF AIR,shore and in his dunnest deeps amidst pearls and sea-born blooms.
385,SONG OF AIR,
386,SONG OF AIR,"The innumerable myrmidons of his empire, fretted masses, chained"
387,SONG OF AIR,"by weeds, oppress the old Equator."
388,SONG OF AIR,
389,SONG OF AIR,The coasts he laved and swept are marred with deadly froth.
390,SONG OF AIR,"They are now but ruins of the vast poison-chalice of the sea,"
391,SONG OF AIR,all fringed with bloody spume.
392,SONG OF AIR,
393,SONG OF AIR,This is his final anguish and these his final groans.
394,SONG OF AIR,
395,SONG OF AIR,It is the last song of the sorrowing Sea!
396,SONG OF AIR,
397,SONG OF AIR,Hoarsely reverberates his threnody; he piles up higher and
398,SONG OF AIR,"higher his tremendous tomb of sound, beneath which he shall"
399,SONG OF AIR,compose himself in tideless calms of sleep.

406,SONG OF THE SEA,Of all my drops holds memory of birth:
407,SONG OF THE SEA,"My mists no longer rise to robe the Sun,"
408,SONG OF THE SEA,No longer lend great rivers to the Earth.
409,SONG OF THE SEA,"Low in my deeps my broken creatures die,--"
410,SONG OF THE SEA,They die! and their corruption loads my floors;
411,SONG OF THE SEA,"Countless and cold, my lordly monsters lie"
412,SONG OF THE SEA,On league-long sands of continental shores.
413,SONG OF THE SEA,"Where bide you, O white stallions of the waves?"
414,SONG OF THE SEA,"And you torrential surges,--where the crest"
415,SONG OF THE SEA,You flung on leaping mountains that you drave
416,SONG OF THE SEA,Across your father's fields from East to West?
417,SONG OF THE SEA,"Shine forth, O Moon! unveil thee, pallid queen!"
418,SONG OF THE SEA,"Heal me, as when my passion clomb to thine;"
419,SONG OF THE SEA,"Shed down thy lucent drench, thy light serene,"
420,SONG OF THE SEA,"Oh, lift me back to Life and Love--oh, shine!"
421,SONG OF THE SEA,My salt hath lost its virtue in men's blood
422,SONG OF THE SEA,And o'er their hearts the marish vapour crawls;
423,SONG OF THE SEA,"Now Death o'erwhelms me with his colder flood,"
424,SONG OF THE SEA,"And, prey to Time, my royal glory falls."
425,SONG OF THE SEA,
426,SONG OF THE SEA,"Daemon of Fire, fairest of all elements, fairest, purest, divinest,"
427,SONG OF THE SEA,"Spirit of Life and Power, that dwells never with Death!"
428,SONG OF THE SEA,
429,SONG OF THE SEA,"His feet take hold on Earth, but his crest rears its unhampered"
430,SONG OF THE SEA,glory in the highest airs.
431,SONG OF THE SEA,
432,SONG OF THE SEA,"Fleeing from Nature's frozen breast, he trends to lowest crypts,"
433,SONG OF THE SEA,"swift to some final refuge, moving in leaping sheets and sinuous"
434,SONG OF THE SEA,trails.
435,SONG OF THE SEA,
436,SONG OF THE SEA,"The mouths of all volcanoes, once his throne, are choked with"

438,SONG OF THE SEA,of flame.

445,SONG OF FIRE,"Let snows and stagnant seas my province blight,"
446,SONG OF FIRE,Deep down in matrix grots shall I consume
447,SONG OF FIRE,"My mother's flesh, my spirit and the night."
448,SONG OF FIRE,"I shall beat about her heart a few brief years,--"
449,SONG OF FIRE,"I, who once rolled fiery gold through all her veins,"
450,SONG OF FIRE,"And soared from mountain-throats o'er hemispheres,"
451,SONG OF FIRE,And throbbed in huts and palaces and fanes.
452,SONG OF FIRE,What power in me abode! what loveliness!
453,SONG OF FIRE,"The three vast elements proclaimed me king,"
454,SONG OF FIRE,Straight from the Sun I sank with gifts to bless
455,SONG OF FIRE,The world with living tongue and burning wing.
456,SONG OF FIRE,"I came, and Man sat caverned with the brute;"
457,SONG OF FIRE,I nursed him and he rose into a god;
458,SONG OF FIRE,I leave him and he withers with the fruit
459,SONG OF FIRE,Of ages on the ground his splendour trod.
460,SONG OF FIRE,"Farewell, you airs and skies from whence I fell,"
461,SONG OF FIRE,"Fond Earth, farewell, and all thy beauty past--"
462,SONG OF FIRE,"And thou, old pulseless Ocean foe, farewell!--"
463,SONG OF FIRE,"All dead! I too shall die, though I be last."
464,SONG OF FIRE,
465,SONG OF FIRE,Utter silence and utter lifelessness engulf the Globe; the frozen
466,SONG OF FIRE,and adamantine bars of oblivion fall.
467,SONG OF FIRE,
468,SONG OF FIRE,"As the soft sibilant tones of the Fire-daemon flutter away, slowly"
469,SONG OF FIRE,the spheres recede and vanish in the clasp of Night.
470,SONG OF FIRE,
471,SONG OF FIRE,"Once more is heard, sweet and clear, the voice of the Spirit"

473,SONG OF FIRE,
474,SONG OF FIRE,"Her music of mercy sinks softly down like star-dust, or as of old"
475,SONG OF FIRE,dew on terrestrial flowers.
476,SONG OF FIRE,
477,SONG OF FIRE,"Through the infinite Universe, through Eternity, she sings her"
478,SONG OF FIRE,everlasting song.
479,SONG OF FIRE,
480,SONG OF FIRE,She lulls her endless flocks of worlds asleep; she seals them up
481,SONG OF FIRE,in the dark cycles of mutation--or makes them to bloom in the Night.
482,SONG OF FIRE,
483,SONG OF FIRE,For they awaken once more when rings aloud the impulsive alternating
484,SONG OF FIRE,"song of the Spirit of Life, her joyful sister, clad with inevitable"
485,SONG OF FIRE,day.
486,SONG OF FIRE,
487,SONG OF FIRE,Now the solar orbs are overcast with swift eclipse as with a mantle.
488,SONG OF FIRE,
489,SONG OF FIRE,They are swept into illimitable abysses.
490,SONG OF FIRE,
491,SONG OF FIRE,"Above, below and all about gleam vast cohorts and constellations"
492,SONG OF FIRE,"of living stars, pouring crystalline melody from thrones of Light."
493,SONG OF FIRE,
494,SONG OF FIRE,"Ghosts of worlds drift by, and suns wrapped in extinction."
495,SONG OF FIRE,
496,SONG OF FIRE,"They too are floating tombs, in them too, Life, Love and Thought"
497,SONG OF FIRE,lie sepultured like seeds.
498,SONG OF FIRE,
499,SONG OF FIRE,"Sepultured, until from the mighty marriage of orb with orb in"
500,SONG OF FIRE,planetary impact shall the great rose of Existence re-unfold its
501,SONG OF FIRE,leaves in the light and warmth of suns new-born.
502,SONG OF FIRE,

518,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,"Float back to Death, pearls dead and lustreless,"
519,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,So he may sow you on the stormy streams
520,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,That wander unto aweful wars and press
521,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,"Onward their throneless orbs that know no beams,--"
522,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,Blind sepulchres that hold within their stones
523,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,Ashes that sang and dust that shone with thought.
524,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,Though suns on suns emergent dash your zones
525,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,"With lustre-floods,--no wonder shall be wrought,"
526,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,Till out of ruins of transmuting strife
527,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,"With sister globes that weld the eternal chain,"
528,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,You win alternate Life and Death and Life
529,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,Again . . . and again . . . and again . . .
530,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,
531,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS,The voice of the Spirit passes away into Immensity.

544,RE-BIRTH,
545,RE-BIRTH,The tides of Life pulsate with the prophecy of Birth.
546,RE-BIRTH,
547,RE-BIRTH,Now it is the Song of the Spirit of Creation that is heard on high
548,RE-BIRTH,above the perished Solar Universe.
549,RE-BIRTH,
550,RE-BIRTH,"The dead worlds are hidden in the lap of Night, sightless, forlorn"
551,RE-BIRTH,"wanderers. They move in darkness, unseeing and unseen, though"
552,RE-BIRTH,smitten by the rays of living stars.
553,RE-BIRTH,
554,RE-BIRTH,Upon their cold breasts of stone the dust of ruined worlds lies as
555,RE-BIRTH,a garment. Windless it lies as it falls or rises out of Chaos that
556,RE-BIRTH,encompasses all.
557,RE-BIRTH,
558,RE-BIRTH,The Spirit of Creation moves grandly through the deeps. In her hands
559,RE-BIRTH,"she bears Fire and Light, on her lips her all-conquering command."
560,RE-BIRTH,"She flings dead worlds among the dead, as a sower his seed or a"
561,RE-BIRTH,slinger his stones.
562,RE-BIRTH,
563,RE-BIRTH,"A spark is lit in the vast obscure. A glory, a rose of fire, blooms"
564,RE-BIRTH,in the pit of darkness. It is now a glowing mist with far-spread
565,RE-BIRTH,"vans, a phoenix wrought of flame."
566,RE-BIRTH,
567,RE-BIRTH,The cloud gathers about it its flowing veils and swarming foam of
568,RE-BIRTH,Fire. It winds them around its white effulgent heart. The sundered
569,RE-BIRTH,"flakes of crimson twist and turn, they shrink, yet do not flee."
570,RE-BIRTH,
571,RE-BIRTH,Out of the blazing mists a new-born Sun shapes forth his awful
572,RE-BIRTH,"splendour. His worlds divest themselves of robes and wings, shining"
573,RE-BIRTH,in beauty white and pure.
574,RE-BIRTH,
575,RE-BIRTH,The dead are born again and the stars rejoice in light.

592,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CREATION,You bear the seed of Worlds; from you shall spring
593,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CREATION,A Universe through roaring cycles spun
594,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CREATION,Round him whose bulk enormous crowns him king
595,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CREATION,"And master of all vassal orbs, the Sun!"
596,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CREATION,"You golden worlds or white, you gelid Moons,"

611,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CREATION,"He shakes his threshing, intolerable mane of flames, his face bans"
612,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CREATION,darkness and makes a burning void in his domains. He pours his
613,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CREATION,lustihood and power upon the joyous spheres. His rays transmute all
614,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CREATION,things. Through the dancing infant host his Magnificat is upborne
615,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CREATION,on the breath of his desire.
616,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CREATION,
617,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CREATION,Triumphant rolls his paean. He casts from him his tempests of solar

638,SONG OF THE SUN,Hold high your mirrored Moons!--you myrmidons

640,SONG OF THE SUN,"Far-wandering lights, go seek my brother spheres"
641,SONG OF THE SUN,"And yonder orbs, now basking span on span;"

654,SONG OF THE SUN,rains struggle through her fervent Airs.
655,SONG OF THE SUN,
656,SONG OF THE SUN,"She floats, a watery globe, in the face of the Sun."
657,SONG OF THE SUN,
658,SONG OF THE SUN,She urges up her writhing continents that smoke high unto Heaven.
659,SONG OF THE SUN,
660,SONG OF THE SUN,And they grow green as her Seas are green. The Winds are in her

680,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,From fane to fane in adoration pace.
681,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,The rapt Equator's crimson cincture holds
682,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,"Me close; my emerald ocean-robes flow free,"
683,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,"And purple soar my mountains, folds on folds,"
684,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,With vale and plain. My bondmaid Moon to me
685,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,Reveals her marbled snow in cusp and shale--
686,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,Whilst in my flinty womb the valiant strife
687,SONG OF THE PLANET EARTH,Of Fire proclaims me thine and bans the pale

731,SONG OF THE MOON,With pearls of white enchantment I bestrew
732,SONG OF THE MOON,The happy realms where lovers hunt their bliss;

804,SONG OF THE SEA,"FLOW, Waters! spread afar my zones of green,"
805,SONG OF THE SEA,So I with salt baptismal waves may haunt
806,SONG OF THE SEA,"And bathe the new-sprung continents terrene,"
807,SONG OF THE SEA,Hearing my freshets and young rivers chaunt.
808,SONG OF THE SEA,"O white-armed children of mine elder waves,"
809,SONG OF THE SEA,Behold what golden lands lie in your sight!
810,SONG OF THE SEA,"Bellow! you molten thunders, in my caves,"
811,SONG OF THE SEA,"You whales, gush forth your fountains of delight!"
812,SONG OF THE SEA,"Dance, merfolk and mad dolphins, dance the Seas,--"
813,SONG OF THE SEA,"My watery palace-halls are deep and wide,"
814,SONG OF THE SEA,And Earth hath quaffed mine emerald wine whose lees
815,SONG OF THE SEA,"Shall make her shores teem fertile. O'er my tide,"
816,SONG OF THE SEA,The ermine of my surges and the flags
817,SONG OF THE SEA,"And mews lie dense, and pearls sleep in my breast."
818,SONG OF THE SEA,"The coral burns upon my darkest crags,"
819,SONG OF THE SEA,"And the slow, mountant atoll knows no rest."
820,SONG OF THE SEA,"My leman fair, the charmed Moon, bends low"
821,SONG OF THE SEA,"To draw me with her webs of mute desire,"
822,SONG OF THE SEA,And lo! beyond her magic empires glow

828,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,
829,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"Earth, the Element, mute, impassive, primal, lies shaped to"
830,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"valley, plain and peak. Enwombed in her, the ancient vast"
831,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,fertility lives on.
832,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,
833,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"Her veins are charged with promise and birth, exhaustless"
834,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,quickenings of her eager flesh. She drinks from rocky bowls
835,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"where lakes lie spread, from twining rivers and living streams."
836,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,
837,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,She pours her virgin vigour through fields no plow has riven.
838,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"In darkness granite-ribbed, she prisons her mineral hoards."
839,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,
840,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,She lies as a garment upon the Mother-sphere; her feet trespass
841,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,on Ocean.
842,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,
843,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"Her heart is fretted with Fire, her flanks by the Seas, her"

855,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,Checks Seas and winnows Winds and frets the sky.
856,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"Deep in my vaulted heart and womb of fire,"

858,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"The seeds of Life glow teeming--O Sun-king, sire!"
859,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"Arch-quickener of Existence, gild these crests;--"
860,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"Scatter thy warmth till harvest clothe these plains,"
861,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"And I shall broider me in bridal dreams,"
862,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"Yea, light my feast with blazonry, my veins"
863,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,Leap like my crystal and tellurian streams.
864,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,In me bright blooms and golden fruitage blown
865,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"Shall mark where errant, immortal summers creep,"
866,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"And man that is flesh of me, in every zone"

873,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"Child of the Sun, unmastered and insurgent pulse of Life; breath"

875,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,
876,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"Comes Fire, pontiff celestial, King of Elements, errant angel,"
877,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,that basks and rejoices in his spaces.
878,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,
879,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,He comes and takes from darkness and cold their undivided
880,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"victories. Out of the famished sands he leaps, out of the crater's"
881,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,maw.
882,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,
883,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"The genius of flame winds on, touching the peaks with consecration."
884,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,His red and golden nakedness is crested with his sable clouds of hair.
885,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,
886,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,Upward and onward he aspires. His crimson vans are spread against
887,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,"the heavens, his torches flutter, making glorious the funerals"
888,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,of the day. His feet are a scourge across the soil; his arms
889,SONG OF EARTH THE ELEMENT,are lifted to the stars.

899,SONG OF FIRE,"Lo! Fire am I,--without me shall endure"
900,SONG OF FIRE,"No Life, nor plant nor creature lift its head."
901,SONG OF FIRE,In burning beards of comets red I float;
902,SONG OF FIRE,I dance with lambent torches on the stars;
903,SONG OF FIRE,I wash with sulphurous flame the roaring throat
904,SONG OF FIRE,"Of peaks, and blaze beneath the thunder's cars."
905,SONG OF FIRE,Master of Earth am I;--on her my will
906,SONG OF FIRE,"I stamp, and with fierce searing kisses press"
907,SONG OF FIRE,My passion on her naked flesh and thrill
908,SONG OF FIRE,Her hidden veins with rapture. My caress
909,SONG OF FIRE,Is lustral. In her lovers' hearts I creep
910,SONG OF FIRE,And tip with fateful coals the prophet's tongue;
911,SONG OF FIRE,"God-like from lips of poets I sing and leap,--"
912,SONG OF FIRE,"I the eternal fair, the eternal young!"
913,SONG OF FIRE,And none shall conquer me save they who call
914,SONG OF FIRE,My strength to sovereign toil in craft or strife;
915,SONG OF FIRE,"With me shall tribes of men hold festival,--"
916,SONG OF FIRE,Cities and realms shall find me Death or Life.

922,SONG OF FIRE,"and toilers, labour in felicity."
923,SONG OF FIRE,
924,SONG OF FIRE,Chaos and Night and Death are disenthroned. The system burns along
925,SONG OF FIRE,its orbits through the dark. The benisons of the stars and suns
926,SONG OF FIRE,are cast upon these youngest worlds.
927,SONG OF FIRE,
928,SONG OF FIRE,Buoyant and blithe the planets wheel.
929,SONG OF FIRE,
930,SONG OF FIRE,Their year-long arcs and each season's ordained processional
931,SONG OF FIRE,are portioned unto them: their vassal moons also and the speed of
932,SONG OF FIRE,their turning and their measure of night and day.
933,SONG OF FIRE,
934,SONG OF FIRE,"The ruddy jocund Earth presses close to the Sun, timorous of the"
935,SONG OF FIRE,"outer void, baring her bosom to his kiss."
936,SONG OF FIRE,
937,SONG OF FIRE,Has not the inevitable and recurrent Spring of Existence come
938,SONG OF FIRE,unto her once again? The iron shackles of Silence--are they
939,SONG OF FIRE,"not broken?--the granite of the Night, is it not crumbled low?--the"
940,SONG OF FIRE,"ice of Death, is it not molten?"
941,SONG OF FIRE,
942,SONG OF FIRE,She blooms in her resurrection; her voice is lifted in the
943,SONG OF FIRE,universal litany to Life. She rolls in her golden garniture of
944,SONG OF FIRE,"beams, circling with the singing sister-spheres. Her rondure"
945,SONG OF FIRE,floats against the distant cohorts of the constellations.
946,SONG OF FIRE,
947,SONG OF FIRE,"The ancient Spirit of Chaos swings her pitchy cressets, and"
948,SONG OF FIRE,sinks down the starless deep on her tall catafalque of Death.
949,SONG OF FIRE,
950,SONG OF FIRE,"Rejoice, O orb vestured in beauty! Put forth thy wings, thy"
951,SONG OF FIRE,"coronals of Love, wrap thee with fluctuant Winds and exulting Seas!"
952,SONG OF FIRE,
953,SONG OF FIRE,"Shall thy offspring feel dismay, knowing what light shall burst"
954,SONG OF FIRE,"from dark, what life leap from Death, what flowers blow from dust?"
955,SONG OF FIRE,
956,SONG OF FIRE,"So the anointed and belted spheres, re-risen from their"
957,SONG OF FIRE,"bath of silence and their sleep of time, move on companioned"
958,SONG OF FIRE,with eternal hope.
959,SONG OF FIRE,
960,SONG OF FIRE,The fingers of the Sun stroke forth a glorious strain; the
961,SONG OF FIRE,worlds are shawns and cymbals for his minstrelsy. The Spirit
962,SONG OF FIRE,of Creation pours forth her victorious baptismal harmonies.
963,SONG OF FIRE,
964,SONG OF FIRE,Triumphantly her music daunts the firmament and echoes against
965,SONG OF FIRE,the dusks of the Unapproachable.

976,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CREATION,"Whose prows shall cross the dim, celestial bars"
977,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CREATION,"With helm sidereal and cloudy sail,"
978,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CREATION,Bannered with youth and lanterned with the stars.
979,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CREATION,What fates for ballast? by what voices grim
980,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CREATION,"And laughters urged, your astral course I mark,--"
981,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CREATION,Warped to what ports remote your hulks shall swim
982,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CREATION,Or anchor silent in what stagnant dark?
983,SONG OF THE SPIRIT OF CREATION,Mine arms have raised you from the cosmic deep;
