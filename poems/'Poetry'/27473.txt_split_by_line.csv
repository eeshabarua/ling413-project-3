27,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
28,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Young Hafbur King and Sivard King
29,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,They lived in bitter enmity;
30,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"'Twas Signe proud that caused their feud,"
31,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Of maidens all the fairest she.
32,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
33,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,It was youthful Hafbur King
34,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Awaked at midnight with a bound,"
35,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And full of dread he straightway said
36,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,His wondrous dream to all around.
37,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
38,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Methought I was in heaven's domain,"
39,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Within that place so fair to view,"
40,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And held to my breast my loved one prest,"
41,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"When down we fell the cloudlets through."""
42,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
43,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And there sat all the Dames and maids
44,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And little heeded what he said;
45,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"But lent an ear his mother dear,"
46,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,'Twas she alone attention paid.
47,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
48,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""My son do thou to the mountain go,"
49,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And look that thou dost go with speed;
50,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"The Daughter demand of Elfin land,"
51,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And she to thee thy dream will rede."""
52,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
53,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,It was young King Hafbur bold
54,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"In his left hand he took his blade,"
55,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And away he hied to the mountain's side
56,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,To seek the lovely elfin maid.
57,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
58,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,With his fingers white he thrice tapped light
59,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Upon the mountain's side so green;
60,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"The daughter of Elle lay awake, and well"
61,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Could guess what did that tapping mean.
62,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
63,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Hail, daughter fair of Elfland's King,"
64,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Whom here I see in costly wede!
65,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,I beg for love of the God above
66,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,That thou to me my dream wilt rede.
67,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
68,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Methought I was in Heaven's domain,"
69,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Within that place so fair to view,"
70,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And held to my breast my loved one prest,"
71,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"When down I sank the cloudlets through."""
72,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
73,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Thy dreaming thou wast in heaven, doth mean"
74,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,That thou shalt win the damsel proud;
75,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,But that thou shalt die for her is shown
76,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"By thy falling through the little cloud."""
77,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
78,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""And if for me it destined be"
79,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"To win the maid for whom I sigh,"
80,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,I'll ne'er complain if Fate ordain
81,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"That afterwards for her I die."""
82,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
83,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Sir Hafbur lets his hair grow long,"
84,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And maiden's clothes he caused be made;
85,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And away he rode to the high abode
86,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Of Siward King, to learn to braid."
87,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
88,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"For himself he clothes has caused be made,"
89,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,All such as high born damsels wear;
90,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Then away rode he o'er hill and lea
91,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,To seek King Siward's daughter fair.
92,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
93,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,When he had reached the castle yard
94,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,In haste he smoothed his array;
95,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"To the hall of state where ladies wait,"
96,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And maids, then swift he takes his way."
97,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
98,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Now hail to you, ye lovely dames,"
99,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And hail ye, maids of high degree!"
100,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And hail the child that's Signild styled,"
101,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"The Dane King's child, if here she be!"
102,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
103,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Hail Signild, daughter of the King,"
104,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Who here art spinning silken thread;
105,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Sir Hafbur me has sent to thee
106,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"That thou mayst teach me how to braid."""
107,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
108,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""If thou dost come by Hafbur sent,"
109,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,A welcome guest thou here shalt be;
110,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,What I can impart of the braiding art
111,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,I'll willingly impart to thee.
112,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
113,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Whate'er I know of the braiding art"
114,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,I'll willingly to thee disclose;
115,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And thou thy meat from my dish shalt eat,"
116,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And with my best loved maid repose."""
117,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
118,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""O I have eat with princely maids,"
119,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And by their sides have often lain;
120,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"I should pine, I trow, if bid to go"
121,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"To bed with one of the servant train."""
122,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
123,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Well do not grieve my pretty may!"
124,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,We'll do thee no disgrace nor harm;
125,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And thou thy meat from my dish shalt eat,"
126,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And thou shalt sleep within my arm."""
127,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
128,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And there sat all the damsels proud,"
129,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And with their work dispatch they made,"
130,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Save Hafbur alone, the King's good son,"
131,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Who with his needle often play'd.
132,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
133,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"They sewed the hart, and they sewed the hind,"
134,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,In good green wood that ran about;
135,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Of cup of gold he scarce got hold
136,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,But Hafbur all the wine drunk out.
137,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
138,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"In came the wicked servant maid,"
139,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,In evil hour in came she:
140,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Where'er I've been I ne'er have seen"
141,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,A maid know less of broidery.
142,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
143,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""A damsel fair I ne'er have seen"
144,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Who understood of stitching less;
145,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And ne'er on earth a maid of birth
146,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Drink wine with greater eagerness."""
147,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
148,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Then out and said the wicked maid,"
149,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And loud with her sharp voice she spake:
150,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""No maid I've viewed of noble blood"
151,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Such draughts of power ever take.
152,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
153,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""She never sews so small a seam"
154,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,But with her needle she doth stop;
155,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"No cup so great she gets, but straight"
156,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,She drains it to the bottom drop.
157,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
158,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Two eyes she has, and eyes so bold"
159,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,In high born maid I ne'er have seen;
160,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And she doth bear of hands a pair
161,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Which cast of iron seem, I ween."""
162,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
163,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Now do thou hear, thou servant maid,"
164,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Thy jeers at me why dost thou throw?
165,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Thou needst not fear or blame or sneer
166,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"From me, however thou may'st sew."
167,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
168,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Forego thy scoffs, forego thy jeers,"
169,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And do not watch me in such guise;
170,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,I thee don't mark on thy hand's work
171,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Whatever way I turn my eyes."""
172,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
173,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,'Twas Hafbur then the King's good son
174,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,To sew at length with zeal began;
175,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And he sewed hart and hind with art,"
176,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,E'en as they run pursued by man.
177,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
178,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"He lilies sews, and roses bright,"
179,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,The birds upon the bough he sews;
180,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,At his address they all express
181,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Surprise, they'd him by no means lose."
182,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
183,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And on sewed they till end of day,"
184,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And till some part of night was fled;
185,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"With drowsy brows the proud maids rose,"
186,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,It lists them now to go to bed.
187,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
188,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"So late it was at nightly tide,"
189,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Down fell the dew o'er hill and mead;
190,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Then lists it her proud Signild fair
191,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,With all the rest to bed to speed.
192,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
193,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""O where shall I a bed procure?"""
194,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Said Hafbur then, the King's good son."
195,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""O thou shalt rest in chamber best"
196,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"With me the bolsters blue upon."""
197,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
198,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Proud Signild foremost went, and stepped"
199,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,The threshold of her chamber o'er;
200,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"With secret glee came Hafbur, he"
201,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Had never been so glad before.
202,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
203,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Then lighted they the waxen lights,"
204,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,So fairly twisted were the same.
205,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Behind, behind, with ill at mind,"
206,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,The wicked servant maiden came.
207,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
208,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"The lights were out, the train retired,"
209,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,They thought that they were all alone;
210,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,His upper wede the knight with speed
211,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Did off, then bright his faulchion shone."
212,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
213,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,King Hafbur with delighted heart
214,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Upon the bed himself has flung;
215,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,I tell to ye for verity
216,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,That as he fell his hauberk rung.
217,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
218,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Then out and spake proud Signelil,"
219,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,She could not wonder half enough:
220,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Since I've been born no maid has worn,"
221,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"That I have known, a sarke so rough."""
222,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
223,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Her hand upon young Hafbur's breast
224,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Which shone with ruddy gold she laid:
225,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""To me make known why are not grown"
226,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Your breasts like those of another maid?"""
227,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
228,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""'Tis custom in my father's land"
229,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,For maids to mount and ride to fight;
230,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"My breasts not growing more, is owing"
231,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Unto the chafe of my hauberk tight."""
232,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
233,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And there reclined the night so long
234,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,The youthful hero and the may;
235,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"They talking kept and nothing slept,"
236,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,For in their hearts so much there lay.
237,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
238,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Now do thou hear, proud Signild fair,"
239,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Since all alone ourselves we find,"
240,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Tell me the truth, who is the youth"
241,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"For whom most stands your maiden mind?"""
242,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
243,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""O there is none within the world"
244,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"For whom I feel the least inclined,"
245,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Save Hafbur young, whose deeds are sung,"
246,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And he for me is not designed.
247,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
248,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Save Hafbur young whom it has been"
249,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,These eyes hard fortune ne'er to see;
250,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"I've heard alone his bugle blown,"
251,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"When to and fro the Ting rides he."""
252,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
253,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""And if it is prince Hafbur young"
254,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Whom them dost hold at heart so dear,"
255,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Straight turn your face and on him gaze,"
256,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"For he does lie to thee so near."""
257,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
258,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""If thou art he, why dost thou seek"
259,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,A princely maiden to inveigle?
260,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,In manly sort to Siward's court
261,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Why cam'st thou not with hawk and beagle?"""
262,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
263,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""O maiden, to your father's house"
264,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Long since I came with hawk and hound;
265,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"But my desire he met with ire,"
266,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Still in my ear his scoffs resound."""
267,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
268,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"All, all the time that they did talk"
269,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,They thought that quite alone were they;
270,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"But one stood near, and lent an ear"
271,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,To every word that they did say.
272,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
273,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Shame, shame befall the wicked maid,"
274,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,'Twas she brought much mishap to pass;
275,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,She sly removed the sword approved
276,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Of Hafbur, and the new cuirass."
277,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
278,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"When she had removed the sword approved,"
279,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And Hafbur's good cuirass beside;
280,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,To the hall away where Sivard lay
281,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,The wicked maiden swiftly hied.
282,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
283,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Awake, awake, good Sivard King,"
284,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Too much of sleep is in thy head!
285,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Prince Hafbur know is lying now
286,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"With Signild fair in silken bed."""
287,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
288,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""O young Prince Hafbur is not here,"
289,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And it is false what thou hast told;
290,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"To the Eastern main his way he's ta'en,"
291,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,With Russ and Finman fight to hold.
292,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
293,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""So hold thy peace, thou wicked wench,"
294,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Nor lying tongue 'gainst Signe turn;
295,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Ere morn shall dye the Eastern sky
296,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"For thy foul slander thou shalt burn."""
297,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
298,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Now do thou hear, my noble Lord,"
299,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Believe me all my words are true!
300,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"For see, I have his polished glaive,"
301,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And his cuirass of beaming blue."""
302,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
303,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"So wroth grew Sivard at the sight,"
304,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And loud around he 'gan to shout:
305,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Upstand ye all my merry men tall,"
306,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,For here is come a Kemp so stout.
307,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
308,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Now take ye brand and shield in hand,"
309,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And look ye wield them both aright;
310,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Unto our home is Hafbur come,"
311,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Unasked by me, the hard necked wight."""
312,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
313,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Upon the door they struck with power,"
314,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,With shield and faulchion struck they hard:
315,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Come out, come out, young Bear,"" they shout,"
316,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Come out unto the castle yard."""
317,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
318,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"When that heard she, proud Signelil"
319,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Her lily hands she fell to wring:
320,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Ah! dost not hear, Prince Hafbur dear,"
321,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"How they for thee are clamouring?"""
322,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
323,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Praise be to Hafbur, princely youth,"
324,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Against a host he made a stand;
325,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,They could not all the youth enthrall
326,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Till snapped the bed post in his hand.
327,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
328,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"They Hafbur took, and him they placed"
329,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,In shackles strong and newly made;
330,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"But them in twain he burst amain,"
331,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,As had they only been of lead.
332,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
333,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Then raised the ancient maid her voice,"
334,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And cursed counsel came from her:
335,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Bind yonder Bear with Signe's hair,"
336,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And hand or foot he will not stir.
337,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
338,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Sirs, straightway bind ye Hafbur's hands"
339,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,With one of Signe's silken hairs;
340,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,That little hair he will not dare
341,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"To break, such love for her he bears."""
342,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
343,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And they took two of Signild's hairs,"
344,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And bound with them his mighty hands;
345,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Such love possest the Hero's breast,"
346,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,He would not burst the tiny bands.
347,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
348,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Then out and spake proud Signelil,"
349,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Adown her cheeks the tears ran fast:
350,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""O Hafbur tear the paltry hair,"
351,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Thy Signe's free consent thou hast."""
352,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
353,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And they placed Hafbur, son of the King,"
354,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Fast bounden in the castle hall;
355,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Both maid and dame to see him came,"
356,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And his own maiden first of all.
357,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
358,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"They Hafbur took, the son of the King,"
359,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And in strong irons him they laid;
360,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,In woeful mood before him stood
361,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Full speedily his loving maid.
362,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
363,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,To him with burning tears she spake:
364,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""If Hafbur thou consent will give,"
365,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,My good aunts three on bended knee
366,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Shall intercede that thou shalt live.
367,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
368,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""My father threatens steadfastly"
369,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"To hang thee on the oaken bough,"
370,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Upon the moor at early hour
371,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Before again the sun shall glow."""
372,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
373,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Then answered young King Hafbur bold,"
374,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And in high wrath the Hero spake:
375,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Too light I heed my life, to need"
376,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,That women prayer for me should make.
377,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
378,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Hear, Signild, hear, do thou show clear"
379,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,This day for me thy love is great;
380,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,When in the string thou see me swing
381,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Within thy bower burn thee straight."""
382,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
383,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Then answered him proud Signelil,"
384,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,With streaming eyes and heaving breast:
385,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""By the God above, my dearest love,"
386,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"I'll grant to thee thy last request."""
387,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
388,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"From out the gate they Hafbur led,"
389,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"The King's good son, at solemn pace;"
390,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"For him sore cried all him that eyed,"
391,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,So hard and stern they thought his case.
392,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
393,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And when they reached the verdant plain,"
394,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Where he the gallant youth should die;
395,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"He begged he might have a short respite,"
396,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,He'd prove his Signe's constancy.
397,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
398,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Do ye hang up my mantle red,"
399,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,That Sivard King the same may see;
400,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"He may repent, and yet prevent"
401,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Young Hafbur's hanging on a tree."""
402,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
403,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"When Signild proud the mantle saw,"
404,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,The sight it pierced her like a knife:
405,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""He's dead,"" she thought, ""it vails me nought"
406,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"To tarry longer here in life."""
407,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
408,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"She called together her maids with speed,"
409,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Concealing well her bosom's woe:
410,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""To have some play we'll wend our way"
411,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Unto the lofty chamber now."""
412,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
413,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Then out and spake proud Signelil,"
414,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,She spake in stern determined guise:
415,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""This day I will my own self kill,"
416,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And Hafbur join in Paradise.
417,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
418,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""If any one in our band has helped"
419,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"To bring him to his death so foul,"
420,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Shall rue his wrong when we ere long
421,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Shall burn together all to coal.
422,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
423,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""So many there are in this palace fair"
424,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Whom now the death of Hafbur gladdens;
425,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,But venge will I their cruelty
426,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"This moment on their plighted maidens."""
427,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
428,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Then fire she set to her bower high,"
429,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,The fire so hastily it blazed;
430,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,How well she loved to all she proved
431,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Who on that conflagration gazed.
432,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
433,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"It was Hafbur, son of the King,"
434,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,O'er his shoulder blade he cast his sight;
435,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Of Signe good the bower stood,"
436,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Enwrapt in one tremendous light.
437,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
438,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Now take ye down my mantle red,"
439,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And let it lie upon the plain;
440,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Within my breast if I possessed
441,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Ten lives to beg them I'd disdain."""
442,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
443,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"King Sivard out of the window looked,"
444,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And on his mind such horror came;
445,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"For Hafbur he saw hang on a tree,"
446,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And Signild's bower enwrapt in flame.
447,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
448,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Outspake amain the little foot swain,"
449,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And he a mantle red had on:
450,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Now burns in bower the beauteous flower"
451,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"With her fair maidens, every one."""
452,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
453,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Then up and spake grey Sivard the King,"
454,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,His face with paleness ghastly all:
455,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""A fate so dour as this I'm sure"
456,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Did never princes two befall.
457,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
458,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""If I before had heard or known"
459,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"The power of love was half so great,"
460,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"I'd ne'er, I swear, have vext the pair"
461,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,For all the wealth of Denmark's state.
462,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
463,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Run some of ye to Signild's bower,"
464,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And strive to bear my child relief;
465,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Let others race to the gallows place,"
466,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"For Hafbur bold was ne'er a thief."""
467,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
468,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And when they came to Signe's bower
469,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,All burnt they found the Lady fair;
470,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"When out of breath they reached the heath,"
471,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Hafbur was hanging dead in air.
472,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
473,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"They Hafbur took, the son of the King,"
474,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And round him linen white they roll'd;
475,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And him they laid beside his maid,"
476,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,With many a tear in Christian mould.
477,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,
478,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And then the wicked maid they took,"
479,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,And to a death so horrid doomed;
480,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"A fitting bed for her they made,"
481,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,Alive the wretch they have entombed.
