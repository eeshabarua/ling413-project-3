57,_R B_,Transcriber's notes: The poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins contain
58,_R B_,"unconventional English, accents and horizontal lines. Facsimile"
59,_R B_,images of the poems as originally published are freely available
60,_R B_,online from the Internet Archive. Please use these images to
61,_R B_,check for any errors or inadequacies in this electronic text.
62,_R B_,
63,_R B_,The editor's endnotes refer to the page numbers of the
64,_R B_,Author's _Preface_ and to the first page of the _Early Poems_.
65,_R B_,I have therefore inserted these page numbers in round brackets:
66,_R B_,"(1), (2), etc. up to (7). For pages 1 to 7 the line numbers in"
67,_R B_,this electronic version are the same as those referred to in the
68,_R B_,editor's endnotes.

70,_R B_,After page 7 this text mainly follows the editor's endnotes
71,_R B_,"which, apart from the occasional page reference, refer to the"
72,_R B_,poems by their numbers. For example:

123,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,
124,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"THE poems in this book* (*That is, the MS."
125,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,described in Editor's preface as B. This
126,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,preface does not apply to the early poems.)
127,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"are written some in Running Rhythm, the common"
128,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"rhythm in English use, some in Sprung Rhythm,"
129,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,and some in a mixture of the two. And those in
130,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"the common rhythm are some counterpointed,"
131,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,some not.
132,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,
133,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"Common English rhythm, called Running Rhythm"
134,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"above, is measured by feet of either two or three"
135,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,syllables and (putting aside the imperfect feet at the
136,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,beginning and end of lines and also some unusual
137,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"measures, in which feet seem to be paired together and"
138,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,double or composite feet to arise) never more or less.
139,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,
140,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"Every foot has one principal stress or accent, and"
141,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,this or the syllable it falls on may be called the Stress
142,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"of the foot and the other part, the one or two unaccented"
143,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"syllables, the Slack. Feet (and the rhythms made out"
144,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,of them) in which the stress comes first are called
145,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"Falling Feet and Falling Rhythms, feet and rhythm"
146,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,in which the slack comes first are called Rising Feet
147,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"and Rhythms, and if the stress is between two slacks"
148,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,there will be Rocking Feet and Rhythms. These
149,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,distinctions are real and true to nature; but for purposes
150,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,of scanning it is a great convenience to follow the
151,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"(2) example of music and take the stress always first, as"
152,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,the accent or the chief accent always comes first in
153,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,a musical bar. If this is done there will be in common
154,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,English verse only two possible feet--the so-called
155,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"accentual Trochee and Dactyl, and correspondingly"
156,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"only two possible uniform rhythms, the so-called"
157,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,Trochaic and Dactylic. But they may be mixed and then
158,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,what the Greeks called a Logaoedic Rhythm arises.
159,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,These are the facts and according to these the scanning
160,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,of ordinary regularly-written English verse is very
161,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,simple indeed and to bring in other principles is here
162,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,unnecessary.
163,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,
164,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,But because verse written strictly in these feet and
165,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,by these principles will become same and tame the
166,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,poets have brought in licences and departures from
167,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"rule to give variety, and especially when the natural"
168,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"rhythm is rising, as in the common ten-syllable or"
169,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"five-foot verse, rhymed or blank. These irregularities"
170,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,are chiefly Reversed Feet and Reversed or Counterpoint
171,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"Rhythm, which two things are two steps or degrees"
172,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,of licence in the same kind. By a reversed foot
173,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"I mean the putting the stress where, to judge by"
174,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"the rest of the measure, the slack should be and the"
175,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"slack where the stress, and this is done freely at the"
176,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"beginning of a line and, in the course of a line, after"
177,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,a pause; only scarcely ever in the second foot or
178,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"place and never in the last, unless when the poet"
179,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,designs some extraordinary effect; for these places are
180,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,characteristic and sensitive and cannot well be touched.
181,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,But the reversal of the first foot and of some middle
182,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,(3) foot after a strong pause is a thing so natural that
183,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"our poets have generally done it, from Chaucer down,"
184,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,without remark and it commonly passes unnoticed and
185,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"cannot be said to amount to a formal change of rhythm,"
186,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,but rather is that irregularity which all natural growth
187,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,and motion shews. If however the reversal is repeated
188,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"in two feet running, especially so as to include the"
189,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"sensitive second foot, it must be due either to great"
190,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"want of ear or else is a calculated effect, the super-"
191,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,inducing or mounting of a new rhythm upon the old;
192,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,and since the new or mounted rhythm is actually heard
193,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,and at the same time the mind naturally supplies the
194,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"natural or standard foregoing rhythm, for we do not"
195,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,forget what the rhythm is that by rights we should be
196,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"hearing, two rhythms are in some manner running at"
197,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,once and we have something answerable to counter-
198,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"point in music, which is two or more strains of tune"
199,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"going on together, and this is Counterpoint Rhythm."
200,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,Of this kind of verse Milton is the great master and
201,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,the choruses of _Samson Agonistes_ are written throughout
202,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,in it--but with the disadvantage that he does not let
203,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,the reader clearly know what the ground-rhythm is
204,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,meant to be and so they have struck most readers as
205,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,merely irregular. And in fact if you counterpoint
206,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"throughout, since one only of the counter rhythms is"
207,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"actually heard, the other is really destroyed or cannot"
208,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"come to exist, and what is written is one rhythm only"
209,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"and probably Sprung Rhythm, of which I now speak."
210,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,
211,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"Sprung Rhythm, as used in this book, is measured"
212,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"by feet of from one to four syllables, regularly, and for"
213,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,(4) particular effects any number of weak or slack syllables
214,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"may be used. It has one stress, which falls on the"
215,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"only syllable, if there is only one, or, if there are more,"
216,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"then scanning as above, on the first, and so gives rise to"
217,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"four sorts of feet, a monosyllable and the so-called"
218,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"accentual Trochee, Dactyl, and the First Paeon. And"
219,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,there will be four corresponding natural rhythms; but
220,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,nominally the feet are mixed and any one may follow
221,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,any other. And hence Sprung Rhythm differs from
222,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,Running Rhythm in having or being only one nominal
223,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"rhythm, a mixed or 'logaoedic' one, instead of three,"
224,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,but on the other hand in having twice the flexibility of
225,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"foot, so that any two stresses may either follow one"
226,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"another running or be divided by one, two, or three"
227,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,slack syllables. But strict Sprung Rhythm cannot be
228,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"counterpointed. In Sprung Rhythm, as in logaoedic"
229,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"rhythm generally, the feet are assumed to be equally"
230,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,long or strong and their seeming inequality is made up
231,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,by pause or stressing.
232,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,
233,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,Remark also that it is natural in Sprung Rhythm for
234,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"the lines to be _rove over_, that is for the scanning of"
235,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"each line immediately to take up that of the one before,"
236,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,so that if the first has one or more syllables at its end
237,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,the other must have so many the less at its beginning;
238,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,and in fact the scanning runs on without break from
239,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"the beginning, say, of a stanza to the end and all the"
240,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"stanza is one long strain, though written in lines asunder."
241,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,
242,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,Two licences are natural to Sprung Rhythm. The
243,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"one is rests, as in music; but of this an example is"
244,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"scarcely to be found in this book, unless in the _Echos_,"
245,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,(5) second line. The other is _hangers_ or _outrides_ that
246,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"is one, two, or three slack syllables added to a foot and"
247,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,not counting in the nominal scanning. They are so
248,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,called because they seem to hang below the line or
249,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,ride forward or backward from it in another dimension
250,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"than the line itself, according to a principle needless to"
251,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,explain here. These outriding half feet or hangers are
252,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"marked by a loop underneath them, and plenty of them"
253,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,will be found.
254,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,
255,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"The other marks are easily understood, namely"
256,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"accents, where the reader might be in doubt which"
257,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"syllable should have the stress; slurs, that is loops"
258,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"_over_ syllables, to tie them together into the time of"
259,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,one; little loops at the end of a line to shew that the
260,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,rhyme goes on to the first letter of the next line;
261,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"what in music are called pauses, to shew that the"
262,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"syllable should be dwelt on; and twirls, to mark"
263,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,reversed or counterpointed rhythm.
264,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,
265,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,Note on the nature and history of Sprung Rhythm--
266,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,Sprung Rhythm is the most natural of things. For
267,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,(1) it is the rhythm of common speech and of written
268,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"prose, when rhythm is perceived in them. (2) It is the"
269,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"rhythm of all but the most monotonously regular music,"
270,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,so that in the words of choruses and refrains and in
271,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,songs written closely to music it arises. (3) It is
272,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"found in nursery rhymes, weather saws, and so on;"
273,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"because, however these may have been once made in"
274,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"running rhythm, the terminations having dropped off by"
275,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"the change of language, the stresses come together and"
276,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,so the rhythm is sprung. (4) It arises in common
277,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"(6) verse when reversed or counterpointed, for the same"
278,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,reason.
279,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,
280,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,But nevertheless in spite of all this and though Greek
281,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"and Latin lyric verse, which is well known, and the old"
282,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,English verse seen in _Pierce Ploughman_ are in sprung
283,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"rhythm, it has in fact ceased to be used since the"
284,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"Elizabethan age, Greene being the last writer who can"
285,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,be said to have recognised it. For perhaps there was
286,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"not, down to our days, a single, even short, poem in"
287,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,English in which sprung rhythm is employed not for
288,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,single effects or in fixed places but as the governing
289,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,principle of the scansion. I say this because the
290,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,contrary has been asserted: if it is otherwise the poem
291,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,should be cited.
292,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,
293,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,
294,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,Some of the sonnets in this book* (*See previous note.)
295,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"are in five-foot, some in six-foot or Alexandrine lines."
296,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,
297,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"Nos. 13 and 22 are Curtal-Sonnets, that is they are"
298,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,constructed in proportions resembling those of the
299,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,"sonnet proper, namely 6 + 4 instead of 8 + 6, with"
300,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,however a halfline tailpiece (so that the equation is
301,(1) AUTHOR'S PREFACE,rather 12/8 + 9/2 = 21/2 + 10 1/2).

3045,PREFACE TO NOTES,PREFACE TO NOTES
3046,PREFACE TO NOTES,
3047,PREFACE TO NOTES,AN editor of posthumous work is bounden to give some account
3048,PREFACE TO NOTES,of the authority for his text; and it is the purpose of the follow-
3049,PREFACE TO NOTES,ing notes to satisfy inquiry concerning matters whereof the
3050,PREFACE TO NOTES,present editor has the advantage of first-hand or particular
3051,PREFACE TO NOTES,knowledge.
3052,PREFACE TO NOTES,
3053,PREFACE TO NOTES,"_Sources_ The sources are four, and will be distinguished as"
3054,PREFACE TO NOTES,"A, B, D, and H, as here described."
3055,PREFACE TO NOTES,
3056,PREFACE TO NOTES,"_A_ is my own collection, a MS. book made up of"
3057,PREFACE TO NOTES,Autographs--by which word I denote poems in the author's hand-
3058,PREFACE TO NOTES,"Writing--pasted into it as they were received from him, and also"
3059,PREFACE TO NOTES,of contemporary copies of other poems. These autographs and
3060,PREFACE TO NOTES,"copies date from '67 to '89, the year of his death. Additions"
3061,PREFACE TO NOTES,made by copying after that date are not reckoned or used. The
3062,PREFACE TO NOTES,first two items of the facsimiles at page 70 are cuttings from A.
3063,PREFACE TO NOTES,
3064,PREFACE TO NOTES,"_B_ is a MS. book, into which, in '83, I copied from _A_ certain"
3065,PREFACE TO NOTES,poems of which the author had kept no copy. He was remiss in
3066,PREFACE TO NOTES,"making fair copies of his work, and his autograph of The Deutsch-"
3067,PREFACE TO NOTES,"land having been (seemingly) lost, I copied that poem and others"
3068,PREFACE TO NOTES,from _A_ at his request. After that date he entered more poems
3069,PREFACE TO NOTES,"in this book as he completed them, and he also made both"
3070,PREFACE TO NOTES,corrections of copy and emendations of the poems which had
3071,PREFACE TO NOTES,"been copied into it by me. Thus, if a poem occur in both _A_ and"
3072,PREFACE TO NOTES,"_B_, then _B_ is the later and, except for overlooked errors of"
3073,PREFACE TO NOTES,"copyist, the better authority. The last entry written by G. M. H."
3074,PREFACE TO NOTES,into this book is of the date 1887.
3075,PREFACE TO NOTES,
3076,PREFACE TO NOTES,"_D_ is a collection of the author's letters to Canon Dixon, the"
3077,PREFACE TO NOTES,"only other friend who ever read his poems, with but few exceptions"
3078,PREFACE TO NOTES,whether of persons or of poems. These letters are in my keep-
3079,PREFACE TO NOTES,ing; they contain autographs of a few poems with late corrections.
3080,PREFACE TO NOTES,
3081,PREFACE TO NOTES,_H_ is the bundle of posthumous papers that came into my
3082,PREFACE TO NOTES,"hands at the author's death. These were at the time examined,"
3083,PREFACE TO NOTES,"sorted, and indexed; and the more important pieces of which"
3084,PREFACE TO NOTES,copies were taken were inserted into a scrap-book. That col-
3085,PREFACE TO NOTES,"lection is the source of a series of his most mature sonnets, and"
3086,PREFACE TO NOTES,of almost all the unfinished poems and fragments. Among these
3087,PREFACE TO NOTES,papers were also some early drafts. The facsimile after p. 92 is
3088,PREFACE TO NOTES,from _H_.
3089,PREFACE TO NOTES,
3090,PREFACE TO NOTES,_Method_ The latest autographs and autographic corrections have
3091,PREFACE TO NOTES,Been preferred. In the very few instances in which this
3092,PREFACE TO NOTES,"principle was overruled, as in Nos. _1_ and _27_, the justi-"
3093,PREFACE TO NOTES,fication will be found in the note to the poem. The finished
3094,PREFACE TO NOTES,"poems from _1_ to _51_ are ranged chronologically by the years, but"
3095,PREFACE TO NOTES,in the section _52_-_74_ a fanciful grouping of the fragments was
3096,PREFACE TO NOTES,preferred to the inevitable misrepresentations of conjectural
3097,PREFACE TO NOTES,"dating. G. M. H. dated his poems from their inception, and"
3098,PREFACE TO NOTES,however much he revised a poem he would date his recast as his
3099,PREFACE TO NOTES,first draft. Thus _Handsome Heart_ was written and sent to me
3100,PREFACE TO NOTES,"in '79; and the recast, which I reject, was not made before '83,"
3101,PREFACE TO NOTES,while the final corrections may be some years later; and yet his
3102,PREFACE TO NOTES,last autograph is dated as the first 'Oxford '79'.
3103,PREFACE TO NOTES,
3104,PREFACE TO NOTES,_Selection_ This edition purports to convey all the author's serious
3105,PREFACE TO NOTES,Mature poems; and he would probably not have wished any
3106,PREFACE TO NOTES,of his earlier poems nor so many or his fragments to
3107,PREFACE TO NOTES,have been included. Of the former class three specimens only
3108,PREFACE TO NOTES,"are admitted--and these, which may be considered of exceptional"
3109,PREFACE TO NOTES,"merit or interest, had already been given to the public--but of"
3110,PREFACE TO NOTES,the latter almost everything; because these scraps being of mature
3111,PREFACE TO NOTES,"date, generally contain some special beauty of thought or diction,"
3112,PREFACE TO NOTES,and are invariably of metrical or rhythmical interest: some of
3113,PREFACE TO NOTES,them are in this respect as remarkable as anything in the volume.
3114,PREFACE TO NOTES,"As for exclusion, no translations of any kind are published here,"
3115,PREFACE TO NOTES,whether into Greek or Latin from the English of which there
3116,PREFACE TO NOTES,are autographs and copies in _A_ or the Englishing of Latin
3117,PREFACE TO NOTES,hymns occurring in _H_: these last are not in my opinion of
3118,PREFACE TO NOTES,special merit; and with them I class a few religious pieces which
3119,PREFACE TO NOTES,will be noticed later.
3120,PREFACE TO NOTES,
3121,PREFACE TO NOTES,_Author's Prosody_ Of the peculiar scheme of prosody invented and
3122,PREFACE TO NOTES,developed by the author a full account is out of the question. His
3123,PREFACE TO NOTES,own preface together with his description of the metrical scheme of
3124,PREFACE TO NOTES,"each poem--which is always, wherever it exists, transcribed in the"
3125,PREFACE TO NOTES,"notes--may be a sufficient guide for practical purposes. Moreover,"
3126,PREFACE TO NOTES,"the intention of the rhythm, in places where it might seem doubtful,"
3127,PREFACE TO NOTES,has been indicated by accents printed over the determining
3128,PREFACE TO NOTES,syllables: in the later poems these accents correspond generally
3129,PREFACE TO NOTES,"with the author's own marks: in the earlier poems they do not, but"
3130,PREFACE TO NOTES,are trustworthy translations.
3131,PREFACE TO NOTES,
3132,PREFACE TO NOTES,_Marks_ It was at one time the author's practice to use a very
3133,PREFACE TO NOTES,"elaborate system of marks, all indicating the speech-movement: the"
3134,PREFACE TO NOTES,autograph (in _A_) of _Harry Ploughman_ carries seven different
3135,PREFACE TO NOTES,"marks, each one defined at the foot. When reading through his"
3136,PREFACE TO NOTES,"letters for the purpose of determining dates, I noted a few"
3137,PREFACE TO NOTES,sentences on this subject which will justify the method that I
3138,PREFACE TO NOTES,have followed in the text. In 1883 he wrote: 'You were right to
3139,PREFACE TO NOTES,"leave out the marks: they were not consistent for one thing, and"
3140,PREFACE TO NOTES,are always offensive. Stilt there must be some. Either I must
3141,PREFACE TO NOTES,invent a notation applied throughout as in music or else I must
3142,PREFACE TO NOTES,"only mark where the reader is likely to mistake, and for the"
3143,PREFACE TO NOTES,present this is what I shall do.' And again in '85: 'This is my
3144,PREFACE TO NOTES,"difficulty, what marks to use and when to use them: they are so"
3145,PREFACE TO NOTES,much needed and yet so objectionable. (_Punctuation_) About
3146,PREFACE TO NOTES,punctuation my mind is clear: I can give a rule for everything I
3147,PREFACE TO NOTES,"write myself, and even for other people, though they might"
3148,PREFACE TO NOTES,not agree with me perhaps.' In this last matter the autographs
3149,PREFACE TO NOTES,"are rigidly respected, the rare intentional aberration being"
3150,PREFACE TO NOTES,scrupulously noted. And so I have respected his indentation of
3151,PREFACE TO NOTES,"the verse; but in the sonnets, while my indentation corresponds,"
3152,PREFACE TO NOTES,"as a rule, with some autograph, I have felt free to consider"
3153,PREFACE TO NOTES,"conveniences, following, however, his growing practice to eschew"
3154,PREFACE TO NOTES,it altogether.
3155,PREFACE TO NOTES,
3156,PREFACE TO NOTES,Apart from questions of taste--and if these poems were to be
3157,PREFACE TO NOTES,"arraigned for errors of what may be called taste,"
3158,PREFACE TO NOTES,they might be convicted of occasional affectation in
3159,PREFACE TO NOTES,"metaphor, as where the hills are 'as a stallion stal-"
3160,PREFACE TO NOTES,"wart, very-violet-sweet', or of some perversion of human feeling,"
3161,PREFACE TO NOTES,"as, for instance, the 'nostrils' relish of incense along the sanctuary"
3162,PREFACE TO NOTES,"side ', or 'the Holy Ghost with warm breast and with ah! bright"
3163,PREFACE TO NOTES,"wings', these and a few such examples are mostly efforts to force"
3164,PREFACE TO NOTES,"emotion into theological or sectarian channels, as in 'the com-"
3165,PREFACE TO NOTES,fortless unconfessed' and the unpoetic line 'His mystery must be
3166,PREFACE TO NOTES,"instressed stressed', or, again, the exaggerated Marianism of"
3167,PREFACE TO NOTES,"some pieces, or the naked encounter of sensualism and asceticism"
3168,PREFACE TO NOTES,which hurts the 'Golden Echo'.--
3169,PREFACE TO NOTES,
3170,PREFACE TO NOTES,"_Style_ Apart, I say, from such faults of taste, which few as they"
3171,PREFACE TO NOTES,numerically are yet affect my liking and more repel my sympathy
3172,PREFACE TO NOTES,than do all the rude shocks of his purely artistic wantonness--
3173,PREFACE TO NOTES,apart from these there are definite faults of style which a reader
3174,PREFACE TO NOTES,"must have courage to face, and must in some measure condone before"
3175,PREFACE TO NOTES,he can discover the great beauties. For these blemishes in the
3176,PREFACE TO NOTES,poet's style are of such quality and magnitude as to deny him even
3177,PREFACE TO NOTES,a hearing from those who love a continuous literary decorum and
3178,PREFACE TO NOTES,are grown to be intolerant of its absence. And it is well to be
3179,PREFACE TO NOTES,clear that there is no pretence to reverse the condemnation of
3180,PREFACE TO NOTES,"those faults, for which the poet has duly suffered. The extravagances"
3181,PREFACE TO NOTES,are and will remain what they were. Nor can credit be gained from
3182,PREFACE TO NOTES,"pointing them out: yet, to put readers at their ease, I will here"
3183,PREFACE TO NOTES,define them: they may be called Oddity and Obscurity; (_Oddity_)
3184,PREFACE TO NOTES,and since the first may provoke laughter when a writer serious (and
3185,PREFACE TO NOTES,"this poet is always serious), while the latter must prevent him from"
3186,PREFACE TO NOTES,"being understood (and this poet has always something to say), it"
3187,PREFACE TO NOTES,may be assumed that they were not a part of his intention. Something
3188,PREFACE TO NOTES,of what he thought on this subject may be seen in the following
3189,PREFACE TO NOTES,"extracts from his letters. In Feb. 1879, he wrote: 'All therefore"
3190,PREFACE TO NOTES,that I think of doing is to keep my verses together in one place--
3191,PREFACE TO NOTES,"at present I have not even correct copies--, that, if anyone should"
3192,PREFACE TO NOTES,"like, they might be published after my death. And that again is"
3193,PREFACE TO NOTES,"unlikely, as well as remote. . . . No doubt my poetry errs on the"
3194,PREFACE TO NOTES,side of oddness. I hope in time to have a more balanced and Miltonic
3195,PREFACE TO NOTES,"style. But as air, melody, is what strikes me most of all in music"
3196,PREFACE TO NOTES,"and design in painting, so design, pattern, or what I am in the"
3197,PREFACE TO NOTES,habit of calling inscape is what I above all aim at in poetry. Now
3198,PREFACE TO NOTES,"it is the virtue of design, pattern, or inscape to be distinctive"
3199,PREFACE TO NOTES,and it is the vice of distinctiveness to become queer. This vice I
3200,PREFACE TO NOTES,cannot have escaped.' And again two months later: 'Moreover
3201,PREFACE TO NOTES,the oddness may make them repulsive at first and yet Lang
3202,PREFACE TO NOTES,"might have liked them on a second reading. Indeed when, on"
3203,PREFACE TO NOTES,"somebody returning me the _Eurydice_, I opened and read some"
3204,PREFACE TO NOTES,"lines, as one commonly reads whether prose or verse, with the"
3205,PREFACE TO NOTES,"eyes, so to say, only, it struck me aghast with a kind of raw"
3206,PREFACE TO NOTES,nakedness and unmitigated violence I was unprepared for: but
3207,PREFACE TO NOTES,"take breath and read it with the ears, as I always wish to be"
3208,PREFACE TO NOTES,"read, and my verse becomes all right.'"
3209,PREFACE TO NOTES,
3210,PREFACE TO NOTES,"_Obscurity_ As regards Oddity then, it is plain that the poet was"
3211,PREFACE TO NOTES,"Himself fully alive to it, but he was not sufficiently aware of"
3212,PREFACE TO NOTES,"obscurity, and he could not understand why his friends found his"
3213,PREFACE TO NOTES,"sentences so difficult: he would never have believed that, among"
3214,PREFACE TO NOTES,"all the ellipses and liberties of his grammar, the one chief cause"
3215,PREFACE TO NOTES,is his habitual omission of the relative pronoun; and yet this is
3216,PREFACE TO NOTES,"so, and the examination of a simple example or two may serve a"
3217,PREFACE TO NOTES,general purpose:
3218,PREFACE TO NOTES,
3219,PREFACE TO NOTES,"_Omission of relative pronoun_ This grammatical liberty, though it"
3220,PREFACE TO NOTES,is a common convenience in conversation and has therefore its
3221,PREFACE TO NOTES,"proper place in good writing, is apt to confuse the parts of speech,"
3222,PREFACE TO NOTES,and to reduce a normal sequence of words to mere jargon. Writers
3223,PREFACE TO NOTES,who carelessly rely on their elliptical speech-forms to govern the
3224,PREFACE TO NOTES,elaborate sentences of their literary composition little know what
3225,PREFACE TO NOTES,a conscious effort of interpretation they often impose on their
3226,PREFACE TO NOTES,readers. But it was not carelessness in Gerard Hopkins: he had full
3227,PREFACE TO NOTES,"skill and practice and scholarship in conventional forms, and it is"
3228,PREFACE TO NOTES,easy to see that he banished these purely constructional syllables
3229,PREFACE TO NOTES,from his verse because they took up room which he thought he could
3230,PREFACE TO NOTES,not afford them: he needed in his scheme all his space for his
3231,PREFACE TO NOTES,"poetical words, and he wished those to crowd out every merely gram-"
3232,PREFACE TO NOTES,matical colourless or toneless element; and so when he had got
3233,PREFACE TO NOTES,into the habit of doing without these relative pronouns--though
3234,PREFACE TO NOTES,"he must, I suppose, have supplied them in his thought,--he"
3235,PREFACE TO NOTES,"abuses the licence beyond precedent, as when he writes (no. _17_)"
3236,PREFACE TO NOTES,'O Hero savest!' for 'O Hero that savest!'.
3237,PREFACE TO NOTES,
3238,PREFACE TO NOTES,_Identical Forms_ Another example of this (from the 5th stanza of
3239,PREFACE TO NOTES,no. _23_) will discover another cause of obscurity; the line
3240,PREFACE TO NOTES,
3241,PREFACE TO NOTES,'Squander the hell-rook ranks sally to molest him'
3242,PREFACE TO NOTES,
3243,PREFACE TO NOTES,means 'Scatter the ranks that sally to molest him':
3244,PREFACE TO NOTES,but since the words _squander_ and _sally_ occupy similar positions
3245,PREFACE TO NOTES,"in the two sections of the verse, and are enforced by a similar"
3246,PREFACE TO NOTES,"accentuation, the second verb deprived of its pronoun will follow"
3247,PREFACE TO NOTES,the first and appear as an imperative; and there is nothing to
3248,PREFACE TO NOTES,prevent its being so taken but the contradiction that it makes in
3249,PREFACE TO NOTES,the meaning; whereas the grammar should expose and enforce
3250,PREFACE TO NOTES,"the meaning, not have to be determined by the meaning. More-"
3251,PREFACE TO NOTES,"over, there is no way of enunciating this line which will avoid the"
3252,PREFACE TO NOTES,"confusion; because if, knowing that _sally_ should not have"
3253,PREFACE TO NOTES,"the same intonation as _squander_, the reader mitigates the accent,"
3254,PREFACE TO NOTES,and in doing so lessens or obliterates the caesural pause which
3255,PREFACE TO NOTES,"exposes its accent, then _ranks_ becomes a genitive and _sally_"
3256,PREFACE TO NOTES,a substantive.
3257,PREFACE TO NOTES,
3258,PREFACE TO NOTES,"Here, then, is another source of the poet's obscurity; that in"
3259,PREFACE TO NOTES,aiming at condensation he neglects the need that there is for care
3260,PREFACE TO NOTES,in the placing of words that are grammatically ambiguous.
3261,PREFACE TO NOTES,English swarms with words that have one identical form for
3262,PREFACE TO NOTES,"substantive, adjective, and verb; and such a word should never"
3263,PREFACE TO NOTES,be so placed as to allow of any doubt as to what part of speech
3264,PREFACE TO NOTES,it is used for; because such ambiguity or momentary uncertainty
3265,PREFACE TO NOTES,destroys the force of the sentence. Now our author not only
3266,PREFACE TO NOTES,neglects this essential propriety but he would seem even to
3267,PREFACE TO NOTES,welcome and seek artistic effect in the consequent confusion;
3268,PREFACE TO NOTES,and he will sometimes so arrange such words that a reader
3269,PREFACE TO NOTES,looking for a verb may find that he has two or three ambiguous
3270,PREFACE TO NOTES,"monosyllables from which to select, and must be in doubt as to"
3271,PREFACE TO NOTES,which promises best to give any meaning that he can welcome;
3272,PREFACE TO NOTES,"and then, after his choice is made, he may be left"
3273,PREFACE TO NOTES,with some homeless monosyllable still on his hands. (_Homophones_)
3274,PREFACE TO NOTES,Nor is our author apparently sensitive to the irrelevant
3275,PREFACE TO NOTES,suggestions that our numerous homophones cause; and he
3276,PREFACE TO NOTES,will provoke further ambiguities or obscurities by straining the
3277,PREFACE TO NOTES,meaning of these unfortunate words.
3278,PREFACE TO NOTES,
3279,PREFACE TO NOTES,"_Rhymes_ Finally, the rhymes where they are peculiar are often"
3280,PREFACE TO NOTES,"repellent, and so far from adding charm to the verse that they"
3281,PREFACE TO NOTES,appear as obstacles. This must not blind one from recognizing
3282,PREFACE TO NOTES,"that Gerard Hopkins, where he is simple and straightforward"
3283,PREFACE TO NOTES,"in his rhyme is a master of it--there are many instances,--but"
3284,PREFACE TO NOTES,"when he indulges in freaks, his childishness is incredible. His"
3285,PREFACE TO NOTES,intention in such places is that the verses should be recited
3286,PREFACE TO NOTES,"as running on without pause, and the rhyme occurring in their"
3287,PREFACE TO NOTES,"midst should be like a phonetic accident, merely satisfying the"
3288,PREFACE TO NOTES,prescribed form. But his phonetic rhymes are often indefensible
3289,PREFACE TO NOTES,on his own principle. The rhyme to _communion_ in 'The Bugler'
3290,PREFACE TO NOTES,"is hideous, and the suspicion that the poet thought it ingenious is"
3291,PREFACE TO NOTES,"appalling: _eternal_, in 'The Eurydice', does not correspond with"
3292,PREFACE TO NOTES,"_burn all_, and in 'Felix Randal' _and some_ and _handsome_ is as"
3293,PREFACE TO NOTES,truly an eye-rhyme as the _love_ and _prove_ which he despised and
3294,PREFACE TO NOTES,"abjured; and it is more distressing, because the old-fashioned"
3295,PREFACE TO NOTES,conventional eye-rhymes are accepted as such without speech-
3296,PREFACE TO NOTES,"adaptation, and to many ears are a pleasant relief from the fixed"
3297,PREFACE TO NOTES,jingle of the perfect rhyme; whereas his false ear-rhymes ask to
3298,PREFACE TO NOTES,have their slight but indispensable differences obliterated in the
3299,PREFACE TO NOTES,"reading, and thus they expose their defect, which is of a disagree-"
3300,PREFACE TO NOTES,able and vulgar or even comic quality. He did not escape full
3301,PREFACE TO NOTES,criticism and ample ridicule for such things in his lifetime; and
3302,PREFACE TO NOTES,"in '83 he wrote: 'Some of my rhymes I regret, but they are past"
3303,PREFACE TO NOTES,"changing, grubs in amber: there are only a few of these; others"
3304,PREFACE TO NOTES,are unassailable; some others again there are which malignity
3305,PREFACE TO NOTES,may munch at but the Muses love.'
3306,PREFACE TO NOTES,
3307,PREFACE TO NOTES,"_Euphony and emphasis_ Now these are bad faults, and, as I said, a"
3308,PREFACE TO NOTES,"reader, if he is to get any enjoyment from the author's genius,"
3309,PREFACE TO NOTES,must be somewhat tolerant of them; and they have a real relation
3310,PREFACE TO NOTES,to the means whereby the very forcible and original effects of
3311,PREFACE TO NOTES,beauty are produced. There is nothing stranger in these poems than
3312,PREFACE TO NOTES,the mixture of passages of extreme delicacy and exquisite diction
3313,PREFACE TO NOTES,"with passages where, in a jungle of rough root-words, emphasis"
3314,PREFACE TO NOTES,"seems to oust euphony; and both these qualities, emphasis and"
3315,PREFACE TO NOTES,"euphony, appear in their extreme forms. It was an idiosyncrasy"
3316,PREFACE TO NOTES,"of this student's mind to push everything to its logical extreme,"
3317,PREFACE TO NOTES,and take pleasure in a paradoxical result; as may be seen in his
3318,PREFACE TO NOTES,prosody where a simple theory seems to be used only as a basis for
3319,PREFACE TO NOTES,unexampled liberty. He was flattered when I called him
3320,PREFACE TO NOTES,"_perittutatos_, and saw the humour of it--and one would expect"
3321,PREFACE TO NOTES,to find in his work the force of emphatic condensation and the
3322,PREFACE TO NOTES,"magic of melodious expression, both in their extreme forms. Now"
3323,PREFACE TO NOTES,since those who study style in itself must allow a proper place
3324,PREFACE TO NOTES,"to the emphatic expression, this experiment, which supplies as"
3325,PREFACE TO NOTES,"novel examples of success as of failure, should be full of"
3326,PREFACE TO NOTES,interest; and such interest will promote tolerance.
3327,PREFACE TO NOTES,
3328,PREFACE TO NOTES,"The fragment, of which a facsimile is given after page 92, is"
3329,PREFACE TO NOTES,the draft of what appears to be an attempt to explain how an
3330,PREFACE TO NOTES,artist has not free-will in his creation. He works out his own
3331,PREFACE TO NOTES,"nature instinctively as he happens to be made, and is irresponsible"
3332,PREFACE TO NOTES,"for the result. It is lamentable that Gerard Hopkins died when,"
3333,PREFACE TO NOTES,"to judge by his latest work, he was beginning to concentrate the"
3334,PREFACE TO NOTES,"force of all his luxuriant experiments in rhythm and diction, and"
3335,PREFACE TO NOTES,castigate his art into a more reserved style. Few will read the
3336,PREFACE TO NOTES,terrible posthumous sonnets without such high admiration and
3337,PREFACE TO NOTES,respect for his poetical power as must lead them to search out the
3338,PREFACE TO NOTES,rare masterly beauties that distinguish his work.

3362,NOTES,
3363,NOTES,There is no doubt that G. M. H. had a wrong notion of

3367,NOTES,be satisfied by _splice_ (nautical); and if this notion were
3368,NOTES,"influenced by _weave_, _wove_, that would describe the inter-"
3369,NOTES,weaving of the verses. In the passage referred to in 'The
3370,NOTES,Deutschland' _reeve_ is probably intended in its dialectal or
3371,NOTES,common speech significance: see Wright's 'English Dialect

3377,NOTES,"the first, 'The Escorial', is Easter '60, which is before"
3378,NOTES,Poems G.M.H. was sixteen years old. It is in Spenserian
3379,NOTES,stanza: the imperfect copy in another hand has the first
3380,NOTES,"15 stanzas omitting the 9th, and the author has written"
3381,NOTES,"on it his motto, _Batraxos de pot akridas os tis erisda_,"
3382,NOTES,with an accompanying gloss to explain his allusions.
3383,NOTES,Though wholly lacking the Byronic flush it looks as if in-
3384,NOTES,"fluenced by the historical descriptions in 'Childe Harold',"
3385,NOTES,and might provide a quotation for a tourist's guide to
3386,NOTES,"Spain. The history seems competent, and the artistic"
3387,NOTES,knowledge precocious.

3390,NOTES,

3392,NOTES,With massy pillars of the Doric mood
3393,NOTES,"Broad-fluted, nor with shafts acanthus-crown'd,"
3394,NOTES,Pourtray'd along the frieze with Titan's brood
3395,NOTES,"That battled Gods for heaven; brilliant-hued,"
3396,NOTES,"With golden fillets and rich blazonry,"
3397,NOTES,"Wherein beneath the cornice, horsemen rode"
3398,NOTES,"With form divine, a fiery chivalry--"
3399,NOTES,Triumph of airy grace and perfect harmony.

3414,NOTES,to show that his difficult later style was not due to in-
3415,NOTES,ability to excel in established forms. The poem is alto-
3416,NOTES,gether above the standard of school-prizes. I reprint the

3468,NOTES,"was published in 'Once a Week', and reprinted at least in"
3469,NOTES,"part in some magazine: the autograph copy is dated Aug. 1871,"
3470,NOTES,but G. M. H. told me that he wrote it when he was at school;

3481,NOTES,_1868-1875_ After these last-mentioned poems there is a gap of
3482,NOTES,Silence which may be accounted for in his own words from a
3483,NOTES,"letter to R. W. D. Oct. 5, '78: 'What (verses) I had written"
3484,NOTES,I burnt before I became a Jesuit (i.e. 1868) and re-
3485,NOTES,"solved to write no more, as not belonging to my profession,"
3486,NOTES,unless it were by the wish of my superiors; so for seven
3487,NOTES,years I wrote nothing but two or three little presentation
3488,NOTES,pieces which occasion called for. But when in the winter
3489,NOTES,of '75 the Deutschland was wrecked in the mouth of the
3490,NOTES,"Thames and five Franciscan nuns, exiles from Germany"
3491,NOTES,"by the Falck Laws, aboard of her were drowned I was"
3492,NOTES,affected by the account and happening to say so to my
3493,NOTES,rector he said that he wished some one would write a poem
3494,NOTES,"on the subject. On this hint I set to work and, though"
3495,NOTES,"my hand was out at first, produced one. I had long had"
3496,NOTES,haunting my ear the echo of a new rhythm which now
3497,NOTES,I realised on paper. ... I do not say the idea is altogether
3498,NOTES,new . . . but no one has professedly used it and made it
3499,NOTES,"the principle throughout, that I know of. ... However"
3500,NOTES,I had to mark the stresses . . . and a great many more
3501,NOTES,"oddnesses could not but dismay an editor's eye, so that"
3502,NOTES,when I offered it to our magazine _The Month_ . . . they
3503,NOTES,dared not print it.'
3504,NOTES,
3505,NOTES,Of the _two or three presentation pieces_ here mentioned
3506,NOTES,"one is certainly the Marian verses 'Rosa mystica', published"
3507,NOTES,"in the 'The Irish Monthly', May '98, and again in Orby"
3508,NOTES,"Shipley's 'Carmina Mariana', 2nd series, p. 183: the"
3509,NOTES,autograph exists.
3510,NOTES,
3511,NOTES,"Another is supposed to be the 'Ad Mariam', printed in"
3512,NOTES,"the 'Stonyhurst Magazine', Feb. '94. This is in five"
3513,NOTES,"stanzas of eight lines, in direct and competent imitation of"
3514,NOTES,"Swinburne: no autograph has been found; and, unless"
3515,NOTES,Fr. Hopkins's views of poetic form had been provisionally
3516,NOTES,"deranged or suspended, the verses can hardly be attributed"
3517,NOTES,to him without some impeachment of his sincerity; and
3518,NOTES,"that being altogether above suspicion, I would not yield to"
3519,NOTES,the rather strong presumption which their technical skill
3520,NOTES,supplies in favour of his authorship. It is true that the
3521,NOTES,'Rosa mystica' is somewhat in the same light lilting man-
3522,NOTES,ner; but that was probably common to most of these
3523,NOTES,"festal verses, and 'Rosa mystica' is not open to the"
3524,NOTES,positive objections of verbal criticism which would reject
3525,NOTES,the 'Ad Mariam'. He never sent me any copy of either
3526,NOTES,"of these pieces, as he did of his severer Marian poems"
3527,NOTES,"(Nos. 18 and 37), nor mentioned them as productions of"
3528,NOTES,his serious Muse. I do not find that in either class of
3529,NOTES,these attempts he met with any appreciation at the time;
3530,NOTES,it was after the publication of Miles's book in 1894 that
3531,NOTES,"his co-religionists began to recognize his possible merits,"
3532,NOTES,and their enthusiasm has not perhaps been always wise.
3533,NOTES,"It is natural that they should, as some of them openly"
3534,NOTES,"state they do, prefer the poems that I am rejecting to"
3535,NOTES,those which I print; but this edition was undertaken in
3536,NOTES,"response to a demand that, both in England and America,"
3537,NOTES,has gradually grown up from the genuinely poetic interest
3538,NOTES,felt in the poems which I have gradually introduced to the
3539,NOTES,public:--that interest has been no doubt welcomed and
3540,NOTES,accompanied by the applause of his particular religious
3541,NOTES,"associates, but since their purpose is alien to mine I regret"
3542,NOTES,that I am unable to indulge it; nor can I put aside the
3543,NOTES,overruling objection that G. M. H. would not have wished
3544,NOTES,these 'little presentation pieces' to be set among his more
3545,NOTES,serious artistic work. I do not think that they would
3546,NOTES,please any one who is likely to be pleased with this book.

3568,NOTES,"4. WRECK OF THE DEUTSCHLAND. Text from B, title from A"
3569,NOTES,(see description of B on p. 94). In 'The Spirit of Man'
3570,NOTES,"the original first stanza is given from A, and varies;"
3571,NOTES,"otherwise B was not much corrected. Another transcript,"
3572,NOTES,"now at St. Aloysius' College, Glasgow, was made by"
3573,NOTES,Rev. F. Bacon after A but before the correction of B.
3574,NOTES,"This was collated for me by the Rev. Father Geoffrey Bliss,"
3575,NOTES,"S.J., and gave one true reading. Its variants are distin-"
3576,NOTES,guished by G in the notes to the poem.
3577,NOTES,
3578,NOTES,The labour spent on this great metrical experiment must
3579,NOTES,have served to establish the poet's prosody and perhaps
3580,NOTES,his diction: therefore the poem stands logically as well as
3581,NOTES,"chronologically in the front of his book, like a great dragon"
3582,NOTES,"folded in the gate to forbid all entrance, and confident in"
3583,NOTES,his strength from past success. This editor advises the
3584,NOTES,reader to circumvent him and attack him later in the rear;
3585,NOTES,for he was himself shamefully worsted in a brave frontal
3586,NOTES,"assault, the more easily perhaps because both subject and"
3587,NOTES,treatment were distasteful to him. A good method of
3588,NOTES,approach is to read stanza 16 aloud to a chance company.
3589,NOTES,To the metrist and rhythmist the poem will be of interest
3590,NOTES,"from the first, and throughout."

3592,NOTES,Stanza iv. 1. 7. Father Bliss tells me that the Voel is a
3593,NOTES,"mountain not far from St. Beuno's College in N. Wales,"
3594,NOTES,where the poem was written: and Dr. Henry Bradley that
3595,NOTES,_moel_ is primarily an adj. meaning _bald_: it becomes
3596,NOTES,"a fem, subst. meaning _bare hill_, and preceded by the"
3597,NOTES,"article _y_ becomes _voel_, in modern Welsh spelt _foel_. This"
3598,NOTES,"accounts for its being written without initial capital, the"
3599,NOTES,"word being used genetically; and the meaning, obscured"
3600,NOTES,"by _roped_, is that the well is fed by the trickles of water"
3601,NOTES,within the flanks of the mountains.--Both A and B read
3602,NOTES,_planks_ for _flanks_; G gives the correction.

3687,NOTES,"all day long, and this goes on, the sonnet says, through"
3688,NOTES,"all time, without ever losing its first freshness, being"
3689,NOTES,"a thing both new and old. _Repair_ means the same thing,"
3690,NOTES,"renewal, resumption. The _skein_ and _coil_ are the lark's"
3691,NOTES,"song, which from his height gives the impression of some-"
3692,NOTES,thing falling to the earth and not vertically quite but
3693,NOTES,"tricklingly or wavingly, something as a skein of silk ribbed"
3694,NOTES,by having been tightly wound on a narrow card or

4008,NOTES,thirdly they must not be markedly oldfashioned. You
4009,NOTES,will sec that this limits the choice of words very much
4010,NOTES,indeed. However I shall make some changes. _Back_ is
