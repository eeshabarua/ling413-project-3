229,I,
230,I,"If I were in Japan today,"
231,I,"In little Japan today,"
232,I,I'd watch the sampan-rowers ride
233,I,On Yokohama bay.
234,I,I'd watch the little flower-folk
235,I,"Pass on the Bund, where play"
236,I,"Of ""foreign"" music fills their ears"
237,I,With wonder new alway.
238,I,
239,I,Or in a kuruma I'd step
240,I,"And ""Noge-yama!"" cry,"
241,I,And bare brown feet should wheel me fast
242,I,"Where Noge-yama, high"
243,I,Above the city and sea's vast
244,I,"Uprises, with the sigh"
245,I,Of pines about its festal fanes
246,I,Built free to sun and sky.
247,I,
248,I,And there till dusk I'd sit and think
249,I,"Of Shaka Muni, lord"
250,I,Of Buddhas; or of Fudo's fire
251,I,And rope and lifted sword.
252,I,"And, ere I left, a surging shade"
253,I,"Of clouds, a distant horde,"
254,I,Should break and Fugi's cone stand clear--
255,I,With sutras overscored.
256,I,
257,I,"Sutras of ice and rock and snow,"
258,I,Written by hands of heat
259,I,"And thaw upon it, till 'twould seem"
260,I,Meant for the final seat
261,I,Of the lord Buddha and his bliss--
262,I,If ever he repeat
263,I,This life where millions still are bound
264,I,Within Illusion's cheat.
265,I,
266,I,
267,II,II
268,II,
269,II,Or were I in Japan today--
270,II,Perchance at Kyoto--
271,II,Down Tera-machi I would search
272,II,For charm or curio.
273,II,Up narrow stairs in sandals pure
274,II,Of soil or dust I'd go
275,II,Into a room of magic shapes--
276,II,"Gods, dragons, dread Nio."
277,II,
278,II,"And seated on the silent mats,"
279,II,With many a treasure near--
280,II,"Of ivory the gods have dreamt,"
281,II,"And satsuma as dear,"
282,II,Of bronzes whose mysterious mint
283,II,Seems not of now or here--
284,II,"I'd buy and dream and dream and buy,"
285,II,Lost far in Mâyâ's sphere.
286,II,
287,II,"Then gathering up my gains at last,"
288,II,"Mid ""sayonaras"" soft"
289,II,And bows and gentle courtesies
290,II,"Repeated oft and oft,"
291,II,"My host and I should part--""O please"
292,II,The skies much weal to waft
293,II,"His years,"" I'd think, then cross San-jo"
294,II,To fair Chion-in aloft.
295,II,
296,II,"For set aloft and set apart,"
297,II,"Beyond the city's din,"
298,II,Under the shade of ancient heights
299,II,Lies templed calm Chion-in.
300,II,And there the great bell's booming fills
301,II,"Its gates all day, and thin"
302,II,"Low beating on mokugyo, by"
303,II,Priests passioning for sin.
304,II,
305,II,And there the sun upon its courts
306,II,"And carvings, gods and graves,"
307,II,"Rests as no light of earth-lands known,"
308,II,Like to Nirvana laves
309,II,And washes with sweet under-flow
310,II,Into the soul's far caves.
311,II,And no more shall this life seem real
312,II,To one who feels its waves.
313,II,
314,II,"""No more!"" I'd say, then wander on"
315,II,"To Kiyomizu-shrine,"
316,II,Which is so old antiquity's
317,II,Far self cannot divine
318,II,"Its birth, but knows that Kwannon, she"
319,II,"Of mercy's might benign,"
320,II,Has reached her thousand hands always
321,II,From it to Nippon's line.
322,II,
323,II,"And She should hear my many prayers,"
324,II,And have my freest gifts.
325,II,And many days beside her should
326,II,I watch the crystal rifts
327,II,Of Otawa's clear waters earn
328,II,"Their way, o'er rocks and drifts,"
329,II,Beside the trestled temple down--
330,II,Like murmurs of sweet shrifts.
331,II,
332,II,"Then, when the city wearied me,"
333,II,To Katsura I'd wend--
334,II,A garden hid across green miles
335,II,Of rice-lands quaintly penned.
336,II,"And, by the stork-bestridden lake,"
337,II,I'd walk or musing mend
338,II,My soul with lotus-memories
339,II,And hopes--without an end.
340,II,
341,II,
342,III,III
343,III,
344,III,"Or were I in Japan today,"
345,III,Hiroshima should call
346,III,My heart--Hiroshima built round
347,III,Her ancient castle wall.
348,III,By the low flowering moat where sun
349,III,And silence ever fall
350,III,"Into a swoon, I'd build again"
351,III,Old days of Daimyo thrall.
352,III,
353,III,"Of charge and bloody countercharge,"
354,III,When many a samurai
355,III,"Fierce-panoplied fell at its pale,"
356,III,Suppressing groan or cry;
357,III,Suppressing all but silent hates
358,III,"That swept from eye to eye,"
359,III,"While lips smiled decorously on,"
360,III,Or mocked urbane goodbye.
361,III,
362,III,Then to the river I would pass
363,III,And drift upon its tide
364,III,By many a tea-house hung in bloom
365,III,Above its mirrored side.
366,III,And geisha fluttering gay before
367,III,Their guests should pause in pied
368,III,"Kimono, then with laughter bright"
369,III,Behind the shoji hide.
370,III,
371,III,Unto an isle of Ugina's
372,III,"Low port my craft should swing,"
373,III,Or scarce an island seems it now
374,III,"To my fair fancying,"
375,III,But a shrined jut of earth up thro
376,III,The sea from which to sing
377,III,Unto the evening star of all
378,III,Night's incarnations bring.
379,III,
380,III,Then backward thro the darkened streets
381,III,I'd walk: long lanterns writ
382,III,With ghostly characters should dance
383,III,"Beside each door, or flit,"
384,III,"Thin paper spirits, to and fro"
385,III,"And mow the wind, when it"
386,III,Demanded of them reverence
387,III,And passed with twirl or twit.
388,III,
389,III,"What music, too, of samisen"
390,III,And koto I should hear!
391,III,Tinkle on weirder tinkle thro
392,III,The strangely wistful ear
393,III,What shadows on the shoji-door
394,III,Of my dim soul should veer
395,III,"All night in sleep, and haunt the light"
396,III,Of many a coming year!
397,III,
398,III,
399,IV,IV
400,IV,
401,IV,"Or were I in Japan today,"
402,IV,From Ujina I'd sail
403,IV,For mountain-isled Migajima
404,IV,"Upon the distance, frail"
405,IV,"As the mirage, to Amida,"
406,IV,"Of this world's transient tale,"
407,IV,Where he sits clothed in boundless light
408,IV,And sees it vainly ail.
409,IV,
410,IV,"Up to the great sea-torii,"
411,IV,"Its temple-gate, I'd wind,"
412,IV,There furl my sail beneath its beam;
413,IV,And soon my soul should find
414,IV,"What it shall never, tho it sift"
415,IV,"The world elsewhere, and blind"
416,IV,Itself at last with sight of all
417,IV,Earth's blisses to mankind.
418,IV,
419,IV,"""Migajima! Migajima!"""
420,IV,How would enchantment chant
421,IV,"The syllables within me, till"
422,IV,Desire should cease and pant
423,IV,Of passion press no more my will--
424,IV,But let charmed peace supplant
425,IV,All thought of birth and death and birth--
426,IV,"Yea, karma turn askant."
427,IV,
428,IV,For on Migajima none may
429,IV,Give birth and none may die--
430,IV,Since birth and death are equal sins
431,IV,Unto the wise. So I
432,IV,Should muse all day where the sea spills
433,IV,Its murmur softly by
434,IV,The still stone lanterns all arow
435,IV,Under the deathless sky.
436,IV,
437,IV,And under cryptomeria-tree
438,IV,"And camphor-tree and pine,"
439,IV,"And tall pagoda, rising roof"
440,IV,On roof into the shine
441,IV,"Of the pure air--red roof on roof,"
442,IV,With memories in each line
443,IV,Of far Confucian China where
444,IV,They first were held divine.
445,IV,
446,IV,And o'er Migajima the moon
447,IV,Should rise for me again.
448,IV,"So magical its glow, I dare"
449,IV,Think of it only when
450,IV,My heart is strong to shun the snare
451,IV,Of witcheries that men
452,IV,"May lose their souls in evermore,"
453,IV,"Nor, after, care nor ken."
454,IV,
455,IV,
456,V,V
457,V,
458,V,"Yes, were I in Japan today"
459,V,"These things I'd do, and more."
460,V,"For Ise gleams in royal groves,"
461,V,"And Nara with its lore,"
462,V,And Nikko hid in mountains--where
463,V,"The Shogun, great of yore,"
464,V,Built timeless tombs whose glory glooms
465,V,Funereally o'er.
466,V,
467,V,"These things I'd do! But last of all,"
468,V,"On Kamakura's lea,"
469,V,I'd seek Daibutsu's face of calm
470,V,And still the final sea
471,V,Of all the West within me--from
472,V,Its fret and fever free
473,V,"My spirit--into patience, peace,"
474,V,And passion's mastery.

540,A VISION OF VENUS AND ADONIS,Whose winds like incantations wrap the world
541,A VISION OF VENUS AND ADONIS,And help the moon in her high mysteries.

666,I,I
667,I,
668,I,"O-Shichi, all my heart today"
669,I,Is dreaming of your fate;
670,I,And of your little house that stood
671,I,Beside the temple gate;
672,I,Of its plum-garden hid away
673,I,Behind white paper doors;
674,I,And of the young boy-priest who read too late with you love-lores.
675,I,
676,I,
677,II,II
678,II,
679,II,O-Shichi dwelt in Yedo--where
680,II,A thousand wonders dwell.
681,II,"Gods, golden palaces and shrines"
682,II,That like a charm enspell.
683,II,"O-Shichi dwelt among them there,"
684,II,"More wondrous, she, than all--"
685,II,A flower some forgetful god had from his hand let fall.
686,II,
687,II,
688,III,III
689,III,
690,III,And all her days were as the dream
691,III,On flowers in the sun.
692,III,And all her ways were as the waves
693,III,That by Shin-bashi run.
694,III,And in her gaze there was the gleam
695,III,Of stars that cannot wait
696,III,Too long for love and so fare forth from heaven to find a mate.
697,III,
698,III,
699,IV,IV
700,IV,
701,IV,"O-Shichi dwelt so, till one night"
702,IV,"When all the city slept,"
703,IV,"When not a paper lantern swung,"
704,IV,When only fire-flies swept
705,IV,Soft cipherings of spirit-light
706,IV,Across the temple's gloom--
707,IV,Sudden a cry was heard--the cry that should O-Shichi doom.
708,IV,
709,IV,
710,V,V
711,V,
712,V,"For following the cry came flame,"
713,V,A Chaya's roof a-blaze.
714,V,And quickly was the street a stream
715,V,"Of stricken folk, whose gaze"
716,V,Knew well that when the morning came
717,V,Their homes would be but smoke
718,V,Vanished upon the winds: now had O-Shichi's fate awoke.
719,V,
720,V,
721,VI,VI
722,VI,
723,VI,And waited. For at morning priests
724,VI,In pity of her years
725,VI,And desolation led her back
726,VI,Behind the great god's spheres;
727,VI,"The great god Buddha, who of beasts"
728,VI,And men all mindful was.
729,VI,"O Buddha, in thy very courts O-Shichi learned love's laws!"
730,VI,
731,VI,
732,VII,VII
733,VII,
734,VII,"Love of the body and the soul,"
735,VII,Not of Nirvana's state!
736,VII,Love that beyond itself can see
737,VII,No beauty wise or great.
738,VII,O-Shichi for a moon--a whole
739,VII,Moon happy there beheld
740,VII,The young boy-priest whose yearning e'er into his eyes upwelled.
741,VII,
742,VII,
743,VIII,VIII
744,VIII,
745,VIII,So all too soon for her was found
746,VIII,Elsewhere a kindly thatch.
747,VIII,And all too soon O-Shichi heard
748,VIII,Behind her close love's latch.
749,VIII,They led her from the temple's ground
750,VIII,Into untrysting days.
751,VIII,And all too soon that happy moon was hid in sorrow's haze.
752,VIII,
753,VIII,
754,IX,IX
755,IX,
756,IX,For now at dawn she rose to dress
757,IX,"With blooms some honored vase,"
758,IX,Or to embroider or brew tea's
759,IX,Sweet ceremonial grace.
760,IX,"Or she at dusk, in sick distress,"
761,IX,"Before the butsudan,"
762,IX,Must to ancestral tablets pray--not to her Moto-San!
763,IX,
764,IX,
765,X,X
766,X,
767,X,"Not unto him, her love, who sways"
768,X,"Her breast, as moon the tide,"
769,X,"Whose breath is incense--Ah, again"
770,X,To see him softly glide
771,X,Before the grave god-idol's gaze
772,X,"Of inward ecstasy,"
773,X,To watch the great bell boom for him its mystic sutra-plea.
774,X,
775,X,
776,XI,XI
777,XI,
778,XI,"But weeks grew into weariness,"
779,XI,"And weariness to pain,"
780,XI,"And pain to lonely wildness, which"
781,XI,Set fire unto her brain.
782,XI,"And, ""I will see my love!"" distress"
783,XI,"Made fair O-Shichi cry,"
784,XI,"""Tho for ten lives away from him I then must live and die."""
785,XI,
786,XI,
787,XII,XII
788,XII,
789,XII,"Yet--no! She dared not go to him,"
790,XII,To her he could not come.
791,XII,"Then, sudden a thought her being swept"
792,XII,And struck her loud heart dumb.
793,XII,"Till in her rose confusion dim,"
794,XII,Fear fighting with Desire--
795,XII,"Which to O-Shichi took the shape of Fudo, god of fire."
796,XII,
797,XII,
798,XIII,XIII
799,XIII,
800,XIII,And Fudo won her: for that night
801,XIII,Did fond O-Shichi dare
802,XIII,"To set aflame her father's house,"
803,XIII,Hoping again to share
804,XIII,"The temple with her acolyte,"
805,XIII,"Her lover-priest, who, spent"
806,XIII,"With speechless passion for her face, in vain strove to repent."
807,XIII,
808,XIII,
809,XIV,XIV
810,XIV,
811,XIV,But ah! what destiny can do
812,XIV,Is not for folly's hand.
813,XIV,The flames O-Shichi kindled were
814,XIV,From sea to Shiba fanned.
815,XIV,And it was learned a love-sick girl
816,XIV,Had charred a thousand homes.
817,XIV,Then were the fury-smitten folk like to a sea that foams.
818,XIV,
819,XIV,
820,XV,XV
821,XV,
822,XV,And so they seized her: but not in
823,XV,The temple--O not there
824,XV,Had she been led again by priests
825,XV,In pity--led to share
826,XV,"Her lover's eyes; no, but her sin"
827,XV,Brought not one dear delight
828,XV,To poor O-Shichi--who was now to look on her last rite.
829,XV,
830,XV,
831,XVI,XVI
832,XVI,
833,XVI,For to the stake they bound her--fire
834,XVI,They lit--to be her fate....
835,XVI,"O-Shichi, have I dreamt it all?"
836,XVI,"Your face, the temple gate,"
837,XVI,The fair boy-priest shut from desire
838,XVI,In Buddhahood to-be?
839,XVI,"Then let me dream and ever dream, O flower by Yedo's sea."

1146,THE IMAGE PAINTER,And brow so bravely human.

1724,WRITTEN IN HELL,"Against a castle moated gloomily by a bitter drain of blood,"
1725,WRITTEN IN HELL,From whose fetid wave contumely
1726,WRITTEN IN HELL,Of all truth was reeking fumily
1727,WRITTEN IN HELL,"And infectiously, I stood;"
1728,WRITTEN IN HELL,Waiting for her sign--
1729,WRITTEN IN HELL,A shriek repeated nine.
1730,WRITTEN IN HELL,
1731,WRITTEN IN HELL,I shrank at every aspish quivering fear set crawling in my breast.
1732,WRITTEN IN HELL,But betimes I felt a shivering
1733,WRITTEN IN HELL,Shriek cut ear and brain with slivering
1734,WRITTEN IN HELL,"Stings of terror, sin, unrest--"
1735,WRITTEN IN HELL,Christ! it raised the dead
1736,WRITTEN IN HELL,Out of the moat's black bed.
1737,WRITTEN IN HELL,
1738,WRITTEN IN HELL,Nine times--and then across the thickening reek a rusty draw was
1739,WRITTEN IN HELL,dropped;
1740,WRITTEN IN HELL,Thro portcullis sped a quickening
1741,WRITTEN IN HELL,Shadow past to where with sickening
1742,WRITTEN IN HELL,"Feet, befixed by awe I stopped--"
1743,WRITTEN IN HELL,There she laughed a laugh
1744,WRITTEN IN HELL,No devil's soul could quaff.
1745,WRITTEN IN HELL,
1746,WRITTEN IN HELL,I swear its clamor tore the stuttering leaves from shrub and shrunken
1747,WRITTEN IN HELL,tree;
1748,WRITTEN IN HELL,Swear no limbo e'er heard muttering
1749,WRITTEN IN HELL,Like that spawn of echoes sputtering
1750,WRITTEN IN HELL,Midnight with their drunken glee--
1751,WRITTEN IN HELL,"Yet, ere half were done,"
1752,WRITTEN IN HELL,I could not hear a one.
1753,WRITTEN IN HELL,
1754,WRITTEN IN HELL,She put her finger burning eerily to my lips--I heard them lock.
1755,WRITTEN IN HELL,"Led me then a marsh-way, cheerily--"
1756,WRITTEN IN HELL,Tho the quick ooze spurted drearily
1757,WRITTEN IN HELL,Thro root-rotten curd and rock.
1758,WRITTEN IN HELL,Things like water-ghouls
1759,WRITTEN IN HELL,Slid slimily in pools.
1760,WRITTEN IN HELL,
1761,WRITTEN IN HELL,"She stepped just once upon a hideous burrow, dank and haired with grass;"
1762,WRITTEN IN HELL,Fixed upon me eyes perfidious
1763,WRITTEN IN HELL,"As a fiend's are, yet insidious--"
1764,WRITTEN IN HELL,Questioned if I dared to pass.
1765,WRITTEN IN HELL,"""I will search all Hell"
1766,WRITTEN IN HELL,"To find him,"" from me fell."
1767,WRITTEN IN HELL,
1768,WRITTEN IN HELL,And so was drawn thro dark cadaverous with the sound of gabbling dead.
1769,WRITTEN IN HELL,Where we heard them hoot palaverous
1770,WRITTEN IN HELL,Drivel learned beneath unsavorous
1771,WRITTEN IN HELL,"Moulds, and saw a glutton's head"
1772,WRITTEN IN HELL,"Grin to a hissing bat,"

1774,WRITTEN IN HELL,
1775,WRITTEN IN HELL,"Witch she was, I knew, turned shepherdess to a soul blind as a sheep's."
1776,WRITTEN IN HELL,But I dogged her on o'er jeopardous
1777,WRITTEN IN HELL,Steeps down which she sped with leopardess
1778,WRITTEN IN HELL,Limbs into miasmic deeps.
1779,WRITTEN IN HELL,"""Swim,"" she gasped behind--"
1780,WRITTEN IN HELL,Then like a she-wolf whined.
1781,WRITTEN IN HELL,
1782,WRITTEN IN HELL,It almost seemed to me as deadening as the sluice of dreary Styx.
1783,WRITTEN IN HELL,Fire and foulness mixed with leadening
1784,WRITTEN IN HELL,Slush I drank; but swam the reddening
1785,WRITTEN IN HELL,Stuff a league with weary licks.
1786,WRITTEN IN HELL,Up a sulphurous bank
1787,WRITTEN IN HELL,"We climbed, and there I sank."
1788,WRITTEN IN HELL,
1789,WRITTEN IN HELL,"Again she laughed that laugh--a shrivelling, ghastly, gaunt, uncanny"
1790,WRITTEN IN HELL,spate.
1791,WRITTEN IN HELL,Up I sprang and cursed my snivelling
1792,WRITTEN IN HELL,"Soul for weariness--for drivelling,"
1793,WRITTEN IN HELL,And for so forgetting Hate.
1794,WRITTEN IN HELL,"""You will find him there"""
1795,WRITTEN IN HELL,She pointed--thro her hair.
1796,WRITTEN IN HELL,
1797,WRITTEN IN HELL,I write these words from Hell where bloodily locked with him in fight
1798,WRITTEN IN HELL,I woke.
1799,WRITTEN IN HELL,Where we fall down caverns ruddily
1800,WRITTEN IN HELL,Spilt with glazing gore and muddily
1801,WRITTEN IN HELL,Dashed with stagnant night and smoke.

1995,WORMWOOD,Is he quite sure--quite sure the sap
1996,WORMWOOD,"Of life's not hate, but love?"
1997,WORMWOOD,If I should tell him there's no gap
1998,WORMWOOD,"Between her and a ... nameless hap,"
1999,WORMWOOD,"Would he still want his ""dove""?"
2000,WORMWOOD,
2001,WORMWOOD,Or would he go as blind to buds
2002,WORMWOOD,"As I am, who watch here,"
2003,WORMWOOD,While he is pouring poet floods
2004,WORMWOOD,"From his thin lips, and while his blood's"

2006,WORMWOOD,
2007,WORMWOOD,It would be swords--swords!... And his steel
2008,WORMWOOD,Should rip death from my breast.
2009,WORMWOOD,But would he ever know the feel

2423,ON BALLYTEIGUE BAY,And I buried her quickly. The thorn-trees cover
2424,ON BALLYTEIGUE BAY,Her grave with spines. I pray
2425,ON BALLYTEIGUE BAY,That each in its fall will prick her and shove her
2426,ON BALLYTEIGUE BAY,To colder clay.
2427,ON BALLYTEIGUE BAY,But ... yonder! ... she's up! and moans in the heather
2428,ON BALLYTEIGUE BAY,A whimpering thing!
2429,ON BALLYTEIGUE BAY,I'll bury her deeper in Autumn weather ...
2430,ON BALLYTEIGUE BAY,Or Winter ... or Spring.
2431,ON BALLYTEIGUE BAY,
2432,ON BALLYTEIGUE BAY,And then if she comes with them still to call me
2433,ON BALLYTEIGUE BAY,"Each night, I'll tell her loud"
2434,ON BALLYTEIGUE BAY,He was mine! and laugh when they try to pall me
2435,ON BALLYTEIGUE BAY,With sea and shroud.
2436,ON BALLYTEIGUE BAY,And I'll swear not to care for Christ or Devil.
2437,ON BALLYTEIGUE BAY,They'll skitter back
2438,ON BALLYTEIGUE BAY,"To the waves, at that, and be gone with their revel...."
2439,ON BALLYTEIGUE BAY,God spare me the rack!

2446,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],[1] This clan of tobacco outlaws in Kentucky during 1907-1908
2447,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],cast such disgrace on her good name as years will not suffice
2448,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],to erase.
2449,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],
2450,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],
2451,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],See them mount in the dead of night--
2452,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],"Men, three hundred strong!"
2453,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],"Armed and silent, masked from the light,"
2454,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],Speeding swartly along.
2455,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],What is their errand? manly fight?
2456,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],Clench with a manly foe?
2457,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],I would rather be dead of wrong
2458,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],Than ride among them so.
2459,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],
2460,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],See them enter the sleeping town.
2461,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],Hear the warning shot!
2462,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],"Keep to your beds, free men--down, down!"
2463,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],Dare you to move?--dare not!

2465,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],Black Anarchy their king--
2466,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],I would rather my hand should rot
2467,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],Than have it do this thing.
2468,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],
2469,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],See them steal to the house they seek--
2470,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],"Brave men, O, brave all!"
2471,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],"There lies a sick boy, fever-weak;"
2472,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],Who comes forth at call?
2473,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],"A woman? ""Go in, you bitch!"" they reek."
2474,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],"""Give us the old man out!"""
2475,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],Rather my bitten tongue should fall
2476,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],To palsy than so shout.
2477,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],
2478,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],"And--they have him, ""the old man,"" now,"
2479,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],Bound--with nine beside.
2480,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],"One, a Judge of the Law's grave brow,"
2481,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],Sworn by it to bide.
2482,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],"""Lash him!""--a hundred lashes plow"
2483,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],A free-born back with pain!
2484,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],"God, shall we let such cowards ride"
2485,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],And burn and beat and stain?
2486,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],
2487,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],"O the shame, and the bitter shame,"
2488,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],"That thus, across our land,"
2489,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],Crime can arise and write her name
2490,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],"Broad, with a bloody hand!"
2491,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],"O the shame, and the bitter shame"
2492,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],Upon our chivalry.
2493,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],I would rather have led the band
2494,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],That diced on Calvary.
2495,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],
2496,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],"So, Night-errants, ride on and ride--"
2497,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],"Avenging, wrongly, wrong."
2498,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],But when the children at your side
2499,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],Grow lawless up and strong;
2500,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],When at their drunken hands you've died
2501,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],"As beasts beside your door,"
2502,NIGHT-RIDERS[1],"You will repent, God knows it--long,"

2652,BRUDE[2],Rather in battle

2679,BRUDE[2],"Worship with trembling,"

2726,BRUDE[2],"_Cormo._ Nay, maiden, cruel,"

2731,BRUDE[2],From Druid talons

2733,BRUDE[2],Give but thy vow to wed me!
2734,BRUDE[2],
2735,BRUDE[2],_Lamora._ Wed thee?--thee?...
2736,BRUDE[2],Never--while cliffs
2737,BRUDE[2],O'er the plain jutting
2738,BRUDE[2],Plight void death to the leaper!
2739,BRUDE[2],Never while waves
2740,BRUDE[2],Curl gray lips
2741,BRUDE[2],Yearning to gulf the doomed!
2742,BRUDE[2],
2743,BRUDE[2],_Cormo._ Then thou shalt die! shalt die!
2744,BRUDE[2],Druids shall gash

2848,BRUDE[2],"_Brude (sinking by her)._ Yet ere thy sleep,"
2849,BRUDE[2],"Maid like the dawn,"
2850,BRUDE[2],List to my heart's wild uttering!
2851,BRUDE[2],All I have dared
2852,BRUDE[2],Was for thy love--
2853,BRUDE[2],Tho but to love thee
2854,BRUDE[2],Would I dare all!
2855,BRUDE[2],
2856,BRUDE[2],"_Lamora._ Ah! What is love,"
2857,BRUDE[2],Brude wise and noble?
2858,BRUDE[2],Is it this burning
2859,BRUDE[2],Far in my breast
2860,BRUDE[2],Melting my soul to thine?
2861,BRUDE[2],Is it this power
2862,BRUDE[2],Hid in my eyes
2863,BRUDE[2],Shaping thy face
2864,BRUDE[2],On hill and cloud?
2865,BRUDE[2],"Is it this whisper,"
2866,BRUDE[2],"As of sea-waves,"
2867,BRUDE[2],Singing thy name to me?
2868,BRUDE[2],Yea! So now we may sleep.
2869,BRUDE[2],
2870,BRUDE[2],"[_They lie down._ HORMA, _the hag, who has heard_"
2871,BRUDE[2],"_them, creeps maundering up and gazes at them._"
2872,BRUDE[2],
2873,BRUDE[2],_Horma._ Owl and eaglet?
2874,BRUDE[2],Have they fled?
2875,BRUDE[2],Then let witch-toads sing!
2876,BRUDE[2],"Oaths forgotten,"
2877,BRUDE[2],Would they wed?
2878,BRUDE[2],"Then let bull-bats,"
2879,BRUDE[2],"Wild a-wing,"
2880,BRUDE[2],Flap the moon from heaven!
2881,BRUDE[2],Deep in the forest--
2882,BRUDE[2],Ha! ho! ho!
2883,BRUDE[2],
2884,BRUDE[2],"[_Breaks off, hearing shouts. Continues._"
2885,BRUDE[2],
2886,BRUDE[2],They'll be slain!
2887,BRUDE[2],
2888,BRUDE[2],[_Fleeing._
2889,BRUDE[2],
2890,BRUDE[2],They'll be slain!
2891,BRUDE[2],
2892,BRUDE[2],_Brude (waking)._ What was my dream?...
2893,BRUDE[2],
2894,BRUDE[2],[_Hears the shouts._
2895,BRUDE[2],
2896,BRUDE[2],Lamora! Lamora!
2897,BRUDE[2],
2898,BRUDE[2],[_They start up and look at each other. Silence._
2899,BRUDE[2],
2900,BRUDE[2],_Lamora (at length)._ So was it doomed.
2901,BRUDE[2],Now we must cross
2902,BRUDE[2],Thro the death-fog
2903,BRUDE[2],Unto the blest.
2904,BRUDE[2],"But side by side,"
2905,BRUDE[2],And ere they come.
2906,BRUDE[2],[_Hands him her knife._
2907,BRUDE[2],Here we shall die.
2908,BRUDE[2],But in the Meadows
2909,BRUDE[2],Where the thin shades
2910,BRUDE[2],"Wander and wander,"
2911,BRUDE[2],Ever in love we'll live!
2912,BRUDE[2],Fold first thy arms around me.
2913,BRUDE[2],[_They embrace._
2914,BRUDE[2],
2915,BRUDE[2],_Brude (starting from her)._ Hear! they have come--
2916,BRUDE[2],Cormo! The Queen!...
2917,BRUDE[2],
2918,BRUDE[2],_Lamora._ Then strike! for thy face
2919,BRUDE[2],Alone would I see in death!
2920,BRUDE[2],
2921,BRUDE[2],_Brude (killing her then himself)._ Cormo!... Queen!... Death!
2922,BRUDE[2],Ye shall never ... tear us apart!
2923,BRUDE[2],
2924,BRUDE[2],"[_Falls with her in his arms, as_ BOADICEA"
2925,BRUDE[2],_and warriors enter._
2926,BRUDE[2],
2927,BRUDE[2],"_Boadicea (seeing them)._ Dead!... Leave them, food"
2928,BRUDE[2],For beast and bird!
2929,BRUDE[2],Leave them! away! away!
2930,BRUDE[2],
2931,BRUDE[2],[_All go with pride and spurning._
2932,BRUDE[2],
2933,BRUDE[2],
2934,BRUDE[2],
