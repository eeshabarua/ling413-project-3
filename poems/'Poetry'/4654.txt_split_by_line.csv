19,A FRAGMENT.,
20,PART 1.,PART 1.
21,PART 1.,
22,PART 1.,"Nec tantum prodere vati,"
23,PART 1.,Quantum scire licet. Venit aetas omnis in unam
24,PART 1.,"Congeriem, miserumque premunt tot saecula pectus."
25,PART 1.,"LUCAN, Phars. v. 176."
26,PART 1.,
27,PART 1.,"How wonderful is Death,"
28,PART 1.,Death and his brother Sleep!
29,PART 1.,"One pale as yonder wan and horned moon,"
30,PART 1.,"With lips of lurid blue,"
31,PART 1.,"The other glowing like the vital morn,                        5"
32,PART 1.,When throned on ocean's wave
33,PART 1.,It breathes over the world:
34,PART 1.,Yet both so passing strange and wonderful!
35,PART 1.,
36,PART 1.,"Hath then the iron-sceptred Skeleton,"
37,PART 1.,"Whose reign is in the tainted sepulchres,                    10"
38,PART 1.,To the hell dogs that couch beneath his throne
39,PART 1.,"Cast that fair prey? Must that divinest form,"
40,PART 1.,Which love and admiration cannot view
41,PART 1.,"Without a beating heart, whose azure veins"
42,PART 1.,"Steal like dark streams along a field of snow,               15"
43,PART 1.,Whose outline is as fair as marble clothed
44,PART 1.,"In light of some sublimest mind, decay?"
45,PART 1.,Nor putrefaction's breath
46,PART 1.,Leave aught of this pure spectacle
47,PART 1.,But loathsomeness and ruin?--                              20
48,PART 1.,"Spare aught but a dark theme,"
49,PART 1.,On which the lightest heart might moralize?
50,PART 1.,Or is it but that downy-winged slumbers
51,PART 1.,Have charmed their nurse coy Silence near her lids
52,PART 1.,To watch their own repose?                                 25
53,PART 1.,"Will they, when morning's beam"
54,PART 1.,"Flows through those wells of light,"
55,PART 1.,"Seek far from noise and day some western cave,"
56,PART 1.,Where woods and streams with soft and pausing winds
57,PART 1.,A lulling murmur weave?--                                  30
58,PART 1.,Ianthe doth not sleep
59,PART 1.,The dreamless sleep of death:
60,PART 1.,Nor in her moonlight chamber silently
61,PART 1.,"Doth Henry hear her regular pulses throb,"
62,PART 1.,Or mark her delicate cheek                                 35
63,PART 1.,"With interchange of hues mock the broad moon,"
64,PART 1.,"Outwatching weary night,"
65,PART 1.,Without assured reward.
66,PART 1.,Her dewy eyes are closed;
67,PART 1.,"On their translucent lids, whose texture fine                40"
68,PART 1.,Scarce hides the dark blue orbs that burn below
69,PART 1.,"With unapparent fire,"
70,PART 1.,The baby Sleep is pillowed:
71,PART 1.,Her golden tresses shade
72,PART 1.,"The bosom's stainless pride,                               45"
73,PART 1.,Twining like tendrils of the parasite
74,PART 1.,Around a marble column.
75,PART 1.,
76,PART 1.,Hark! whence that rushing sound?
77,PART 1.,'Tis like a wondrous strain that sweeps
78,PART 1.,Around a lonely ruin                                       50
79,PART 1.,When west winds sigh and evening waves respond
80,PART 1.,In whispers from the shore:
81,PART 1.,'Tis wilder than the unmeasured notes
82,PART 1.,Which from the unseen lyres of dells and groves
83,PART 1.,The genii of the breezes sweep.                            55
84,PART 1.,"Floating on waves of music and of light,"
85,PART 1.,The chariot of the Daemon of the World
86,PART 1.,Descends in silent power:
87,PART 1.,Its shape reposed within: slight as some cloud
88,PART 1.,That catches but the palest tinge of day                     60
89,PART 1.,"When evening yields to night,"
90,PART 1.,Bright as that fibrous woof when stars indue
91,PART 1.,Its transitory robe.
92,PART 1.,Four shapeless shadows bright and beautiful
93,PART 1.,"Draw that strange car of glory, reins of light               65"
94,PART 1.,Check their unearthly speed; they stop and fold
95,PART 1.,Their wings of braided air:
96,PART 1.,The Daemon leaning from the ethereal car
97,PART 1.,Gazed on the slumbering maid.
98,PART 1.,Human eye hath ne'er beheld                                  70
99,PART 1.,"A shape so wild, so bright, so beautiful,"
100,PART 1.,As that which o'er the maiden's charmed sleep
101,PART 1.,"Waving a starry wand,"
102,PART 1.,Hung like a mist of light.
103,PART 1.,Such sounds as breathed around like odorous winds            75
104,PART 1.,"Of wakening spring arose,"
105,PART 1.,Filling the chamber and the moonlight sky.
106,PART 1.,"Maiden, the world's supremest spirit"
107,PART 1.,Beneath the shadow of her wings
108,PART 1.,Folds all thy memory doth inherit                            80
109,PART 1.,"From ruin of divinest things,"
110,PART 1.,"Feelings that lure thee to betray,"
111,PART 1.,And light of thoughts that pass away.
112,PART 1.,"For thou hast earned a mighty boon,"
113,PART 1.,The truths which wisest poets see                          85
114,PART 1.,"Dimly, thy mind may make its own,"
115,PART 1.,"Rewarding its own majesty,"
116,PART 1.,Entranced in some diviner mood
117,PART 1.,Of self-oblivious solitude.
118,PART 1.,
119,PART 1.,"Custom, and Faith, and Power thou spurnest;                  90"
120,PART 1.,From hate and awe thy heart is free;
121,PART 1.,"Ardent and pure as day thou burnest,"
122,PART 1.,For dark and cold mortality
123,PART 1.,"A living light, to cheer it long,"
124,PART 1.,The watch-fires of the world among.                        95
125,PART 1.,
126,PART 1.,"Therefore from nature's inner shrine,"
127,PART 1.,"Where gods and fiends in worship bend,"
128,PART 1.,"Majestic spirit, be it thine"
129,PART 1.,"The flame to seize, the veil to rend,"
130,PART 1.,Where the vast snake Eternity                             100
131,PART 1.,In charmed sleep doth ever lie.
132,PART 1.,
133,PART 1.,"All that inspires thy voice of love,"
134,PART 1.,"Or speaks in thy unclosing eyes,"
135,PART 1.,"Or through thy frame doth burn or move,"
136,PART 1.,"Or think or feel, awake, arise!                           105"
137,PART 1.,"Spirit, leave for mine and me"
138,PART 1.,Earth's unsubstantial mimicry!
139,PART 1.,
140,PART 1.,"It ceased, and from the mute and moveless frame"
141,PART 1.,"A radiant spirit arose,"
142,PART 1.,All beautiful in naked purity.                              110
143,PART 1.,"Robed in its human hues it did ascend,"
144,PART 1.,"Disparting as it went the silver clouds,"
145,PART 1.,"It moved towards the car, and took its seat"
146,PART 1.,Beside the Daemon shape.
147,PART 1.,
148,PART 1.,"Obedient to the sweep of aery song,                         115"
149,PART 1.,The mighty ministers
150,PART 1.,Unfurled their prismy wings.
151,PART 1.,The magic car moved on;
152,PART 1.,"The night was fair, innumerable stars"
153,PART 1.,Studded heaven's dark blue vault;                         120
154,PART 1.,The eastern wave grew pale
155,PART 1.,With the first smile of morn.
156,PART 1.,The magic car moved on.
157,PART 1.,From the swift sweep of wings
158,PART 1.,The atmosphere in flaming sparkles flew;                    125
159,PART 1.,And where the burning wheels
160,PART 1.,Eddied above the mountain's loftiest peak
161,PART 1.,Was traced a line of lightning.
162,PART 1.,Now far above a rock the utmost verge
163,PART 1.,"Of the wide earth it flew,                                130"
164,PART 1.,"The rival of the Andes, whose dark brow"
165,PART 1.,Frowned o'er the silver sea.
166,PART 1.,"Far, far below the chariot's stormy path,"
167,PART 1.,"Calm as a slumbering babe,"
168,PART 1.,Tremendous ocean lay.                                     135
169,PART 1.,Its broad and silent mirror gave to view
170,PART 1.,"The pale and waning stars,"
171,PART 1.,"The chariot's fiery track,"
172,PART 1.,And the grey light of morn
173,PART 1.,Tingeing those fleecy clouds                              140
174,PART 1.,That cradled in their folds the infant dawn.
175,PART 1.,The chariot seemed to fly
176,PART 1.,"Through the abyss of an immense concave,"
177,PART 1.,"Radiant with million constellations, tinged"
178,PART 1.,"With shades of infinite colour,                           145"
179,PART 1.,And semicircled with a belt
180,PART 1.,Flashing incessant meteors.
181,PART 1.,
182,PART 1.,"As they approached their goal,"
183,PART 1.,The winged shadows seemed to gather speed.
184,PART 1.,The sea no longer was distinguished; earth                  150
185,PART 1.,"Appeared a vast and shadowy sphere, suspended"
186,PART 1.,In the black concave of heaven
187,PART 1.,"With the sun's cloudless orb,"
188,PART 1.,Whose rays of rapid light
189,PART 1.,"Parted around the chariot's swifter course,                 155"
190,PART 1.,And fell like ocean's feathery spray
191,PART 1.,Dashed from the boiling surge
192,PART 1.,Before a vessel's prow.
193,PART 1.,
194,PART 1.,The magic car moved on.
195,PART 1.,Earth's distant orb appeared                              160
196,PART 1.,"The smallest light that twinkles in the heavens,"
197,PART 1.,Whilst round the chariot's way
198,PART 1.,"Innumerable systems widely rolled,"
199,PART 1.,And countless spheres diffused
200,PART 1.,An ever varying glory.                                    165
201,PART 1.,"It was a sight of wonder! Some were horned,"
202,PART 1.,And like the moon's argentine crescent hung
203,PART 1.,In the dark dome of heaven; some did shed
204,PART 1.,"A clear mild beam like Hesperus, while the sea"
205,PART 1.,Yet glows with fading sunlight; others dashed               170
206,PART 1.,"Athwart the night with trains of bickering fire,"
207,PART 1.,Like sphered worlds to death and ruin driven;
208,PART 1.,"Some shone like stars, and as the chariot passed"
209,PART 1.,Bedimmed all other light.
210,PART 1.,
211,PART 1.,Spirit of Nature! here                                    175
212,PART 1.,In this interminable wilderness
213,PART 1.,"Of worlds, at whose involved immensity"
214,PART 1.,"Even soaring fancy staggers,"
215,PART 1.,Here is thy fitting temple.
216,PART 1.,Yet not the lightest leaf                                 180
217,PART 1.,That quivers to the passing breeze
218,PART 1.,"Is less instinct with thee,--"
219,PART 1.,Yet not the meanest worm.
220,PART 1.,"That lurks in graves and fattens on the dead,"
221,PART 1.,Less shares thy eternal breath.                           185
222,PART 1.,Spirit of Nature! thou
223,PART 1.,"Imperishable as this glorious scene,"
224,PART 1.,Here is thy fitting temple.
225,PART 1.,
226,PART 1.,If solitude hath ever led thy steps
227,PART 1.,"To the shore of the immeasurable sea,                       190"
228,PART 1.,And thou hast lingered there
229,PART 1.,Until the sun's broad orb
230,PART 1.,"Seemed resting on the fiery line of ocean,"
231,PART 1.,Thou must have marked the braided webs of gold
232,PART 1.,That without motion hang                                  195
233,PART 1.,Over the sinking sphere:
234,PART 1.,"Thou must have marked the billowy mountain clouds,"
235,PART 1.,"Edged with intolerable radiancy,"
236,PART 1.,Towering like rocks of jet
237,PART 1.,Above the burning deep:                                   200
238,PART 1.,And yet there is a moment
239,PART 1.,When the sun's highest point
240,PART 1.,"Peers like a star o'er ocean's western edge,"
241,PART 1.,When those far clouds of feathery purple gleam
242,PART 1.,Like fairy lands girt by some heavenly sea:                 205
243,PART 1.,Then has thy rapt imagination soared
244,PART 1.,Where in the midst of all existing things
245,PART 1.,The temple of the mightiest Daemon stands.
246,PART 1.,
247,PART 1.,Yet not the golden islands
248,PART 1.,"That gleam amid yon flood of purple light,                  210"
249,PART 1.,Nor the feathery curtains
250,PART 1.,"That canopy the sun's resplendent couch,"
251,PART 1.,Nor the burnished ocean waves
252,PART 1.,"Paving that gorgeous dome,"
253,PART 1.,"So fair, so wonderful a sight                             215"
254,PART 1.,As the eternal temple could afford.
255,PART 1.,The elements of all that human thought
256,PART 1.,"Can frame of lovely or sublime, did join"
257,PART 1.,"To rear the fabric of the fane, nor aught"
258,PART 1.,Of earth may image forth its majesty.                       220
259,PART 1.,"Yet likest evening's vault that faery hall,"
260,PART 1.,As heaven low resting on the wave it spread
261,PART 1.,"Its floors of flashing light,"
262,PART 1.,Its vast and azure dome;
263,PART 1.,And on the verge of that obscure abyss                      225
264,PART 1.,Where crystal battlements o'erhang the gulf
265,PART 1.,"Of the dark world, ten thousand spheres diffuse"
266,PART 1.,Their lustre through its adamantine gates.
267,PART 1.,
268,PART 1.,The magic car no longer moved;
269,PART 1.,The Daemon and the Spirit                                 230
270,PART 1.,Entered the eternal gates.
271,PART 1.,Those clouds of aery gold
272,PART 1.,That slept in glittering billows
273,PART 1.,"Beneath the azure canopy,"
274,PART 1.,With the ethereal footsteps trembled not;                   235
275,PART 1.,While slight and odorous mists
276,PART 1.,Floated to strains of thrilling melody
277,PART 1.,Through the vast columns and the pearly shrines.
278,PART 1.,
279,PART 1.,The Daemon and the Spirit
280,PART 1.,"Approached the overhanging battlement,                      240"
281,PART 1.,Below lay stretched the boundless universe!
282,PART 1.,"There, far as the remotest line"
283,PART 1.,That limits swift imagination's flight.
284,PART 1.,"Unending orbs mingled in mazy motion,"
285,PART 1.,Immutably fulfilling                                      245
286,PART 1.,Eternal Nature's law.
287,PART 1.,"Above, below, around,"
288,PART 1.,The circling systems formed
289,PART 1.,A wilderness of harmony.
290,PART 1.,Each with undeviating aim                                 250
291,PART 1.,In eloquent silence through the depths of space
292,PART 1.,Pursued its wondrous way.--
293,PART 1.,
294,PART 1.,Awhile the Spirit paused in ecstasy.
295,PART 1.,"Yet soon she saw, as the vast spheres swept by,"
296,PART 1.,Strange things within their belted orbs appear.             255
297,PART 1.,"Like animated frenzies, dimly moved"
298,PART 1.,"Shadows, and skeletons, and fiendly shapes,"
299,PART 1.,"Thronging round human graves, and o'er the dead"
300,PART 1.,Sculpturing records for each memory
301,PART 1.,"In verse, such as malignant gods pronounce,                 260"
302,PART 1.,"Blasting the hopes of men, when heaven and hell"
303,PART 1.,Confounded burst in ruin o'er the world:
304,PART 1.,"And they did build vast trophies, instruments"
305,PART 1.,"Of murder, human bones, barbaric gold,"
306,PART 1.,"Skins torn from living men, and towers of skulls            265"
307,PART 1.,"With sightless holes gazing on blinder heaven,"
308,PART 1.,"Mitres, and crowns, and brazen chariots stained"
309,PART 1.,"With blood, and scrolls of mystic wickedness,"
310,PART 1.,The sanguine codes of venerable crime.
311,PART 1.,The likeness of a throned king came by.                     270
312,PART 1.,"When these had passed, bearing upon his brow"
313,PART 1.,A threefold crown; his countenance was calm.
314,PART 1.,His eye severe and cold; but his right hand
315,PART 1.,"Was charged with bloody coin, and he did gnaw"
316,PART 1.,"By fits, with secret smiles, a human heart                  275"
317,PART 1.,"Concealed beneath his robe; and motley shapes,"
318,PART 1.,"A multitudinous throng, around him knelt."
319,PART 1.,"With bosoms bare, and bowed heads, and false looks"
320,PART 1.,"Of true submission, as the sphere rolled by."
321,PART 1.,"Brooking no eye to witness their foul shame,                280"
322,PART 1.,"Which human hearts must feel, while human tongues"
323,PART 1.,"Tremble to speak, they did rage horribly,"
324,PART 1.,Breathing in self-contempt fierce blasphemies
325,PART 1.,"Against the Daemon of the World, and high"
326,PART 1.,"Hurling their armed hands where the pure Spirit,            285"
327,PART 1.,"Serene and inaccessibly secure,"
328,PART 1.,Stood on an isolated pinnacle.
329,PART 1.,"The flood of ages combating below,"
330,PART 1.,The depth of the unbounded universe
331,PART 1.,"Above, and all around                                     290"
332,PART 1.,Necessity's unchanging harmony.
333,PART 1.,
334,PART 1.,
335,PART 1.,
336,PART 1.,
337,PART 2.,PART 2.
338,PART 2.,
339,PART 2.,O happy Earth! reality of Heaven!
340,PART 2.,To which those restless powers that ceaselessly
341,PART 2.,Throng through the human universe aspire;
342,PART 2.,Thou consummation of all mortal hope!                       295
343,PART 2.,Thou glorious prize of blindly-working will!
344,PART 2.,"Whose rays, diffused throughout all space and time,"
345,PART 2.,Verge to one point and blend for ever there:
346,PART 2.,Of purest spirits thou pure dwelling-place!
347,PART 2.,"Where care and sorrow, impotence and crime,                 300"
348,PART 2.,"Languor, disease, and ignorance dare not come:"
349,PART 2.,"O happy Earth, reality of Heaven!"
350,PART 2.,
351,PART 2.,"Genius has seen thee in her passionate dreams,"
352,PART 2.,"And dim forebodings of thy loveliness,"
353,PART 2.,"Haunting the human heart, have there entwined               305"
354,PART 2.,"Those rooted hopes, that the proud Power of Evil"
355,PART 2.,Shall not for ever on this fairest world
356,PART 2.,"Shake pestilence and war, or that his slaves"
357,PART 2.,"With blasphemy for prayer, and human blood"
358,PART 2.,"For sacrifice, before his shrine for ever                   310"
359,PART 2.,"In adoration bend, or Erebus"
360,PART 2.,With all its banded fiends shall not uprise
361,PART 2.,To overwhelm in envy and revenge
362,PART 2.,"The dauntless and the good, who dare to hurl"
363,PART 2.,"Defiance at his throne, girt tho' it be                     315"
364,PART 2.,With Death's omnipotence. Thou hast beheld
365,PART 2.,"His empire, o'er the present and the past;"
366,PART 2.,"It was a desolate sight--now gaze on mine,"
367,PART 2.,"Futurity. Thou hoary giant Time,"
368,PART 2.,"Render thou up thy half-devoured babes,--                   320"
369,PART 2.,"And from the cradles of eternity,"
370,PART 2.,Where millions lie lulled to their portioned sleep
371,PART 2.,"By the deep murmuring stream of passing things,"
372,PART 2.,"Tear thou that gloomy shroud.--Spirit, behold"
373,PART 2.,Thy glorious destiny!
374,PART 2.,The Spirit saw                                            325
375,PART 2.,The vast frame of the renovated world
376,PART 2.,"Smile in the lap of Chaos, and the sense"
377,PART 2.,Of hope thro' her fine texture did suffuse
378,PART 2.,"Such varying glow, as summer evening casts"
379,PART 2.,On undulating clouds and deepening lakes.                   330
380,PART 2.,"Like the vague sighings of a wind at even,"
381,PART 2.,That wakes the wavelets of the slumbering sea
382,PART 2.,"And dies on the creation of its breath,"
383,PART 2.,"And sinks and rises, fails and swells by fits,"
384,PART 2.,Was the sweet stream of thought that with wild motion       335
385,PART 2.,Flowed o'er the Spirit's human sympathies.
386,PART 2.,"The mighty tide of thought had paused awhile,"
387,PART 2.,Which from the Daemon now like Ocean's stream
388,PART 2.,Again began to pour.--
389,PART 2.,To me is given
390,PART 2.,The wonders of the human world to keep--                    340
391,PART 2.,"Space, matter, time and mind--let the sight"
392,PART 2.,Renew and strengthen all thy failing hope.
393,PART 2.,"All things are recreated, and the flame"
394,PART 2.,Of consentaneous love inspires all life:
395,PART 2.,The fertile bosom of the earth gives suck                   345
396,PART 2.,"To myriads, who still grow beneath her care,"
397,PART 2.,Rewarding her with their pure perfectness:
398,PART 2.,The balmy breathings of the wind inhale
399,PART 2.,"Her virtues, and diffuse them all abroad:"
400,PART 2.,"Health floats amid the gentle atmosphere,                   350"
401,PART 2.,"Glows in the fruits, and mantles on the stream;"
402,PART 2.,"No storms deform the beaming brow of heaven,"
403,PART 2.,Nor scatter in the freshness of its pride
404,PART 2.,The foliage of the undecaying trees;
405,PART 2.,"But fruits are ever ripe, flowers ever fair,                355"
406,PART 2.,"And Autumn proudly bears her matron grace,"
407,PART 2.,"Kindling a flush on the fair cheek of Spring,"
408,PART 2.,Whose virgin bloom beneath the ruddy fruit
409,PART 2.,Reflects its tint and blushes into love.
410,PART 2.,
411,PART 2.,The habitable earth is full of bliss;                     360
412,PART 2.,Those wastes of frozen billows that were hurled
413,PART 2.,"By everlasting snow-storms round the poles,"
414,PART 2.,"Where matter dared not vegetate nor live,"
415,PART 2.,But ceaseless frost round the vast solitude
416,PART 2.,"Bound its broad zone of stillness, are unloosed;            365"
417,PART 2.,And fragrant zephyrs there from spicy isles
418,PART 2.,"Ruffle the placid ocean-deep, that rolls"
419,PART 2.,"Its broad, bright surges to the sloping sand,"
420,PART 2.,Whose roar is wakened into echoings sweet
421,PART 2.,To murmur through the heaven-breathing groves               370
422,PART 2.,And melodise with man's blest nature there.
423,PART 2.,
424,PART 2.,The vast tract of the parched and sandy waste
425,PART 2.,"Now teems with countless rills and shady woods,"
426,PART 2.,Corn-fields and pastures and white cottages;
427,PART 2.,And where the startled wilderness did hear                  375
428,PART 2.,"A savage conqueror stained in kindred blood,"
429,PART 2.,"Hymmng his victory, or the milder snake"
430,PART 2.,Crushing the bones of some frail antelope
431,PART 2.,"Within his brazen folds--the dewy lawn,"
432,PART 2.,"Offering sweet incense to the sunrise, smiles               380"
433,PART 2.,"To see a babe before his mother's door,"
434,PART 2.,Share with the green and golden basilisk
435,PART 2.,"That comes to lick his feet, his morning's meal."
436,PART 2.,
437,PART 2.,"Those trackless deeps, where many a weary sail"
438,PART 2.,"Has seen, above the illimitable plain,                      385"
439,PART 2.,"Morning on night and night on morning rise,"
440,PART 2.,Whilst still no land to greet the wanderer spread
441,PART 2.,"Its shadowy mountains on the sunbright sea,"
442,PART 2.,Where the loud roarings of the tempest-waves
443,PART 2.,So long have mingled with the gusty wind                    390
444,PART 2.,"In melancholy loneliness, and swept"
445,PART 2.,"The desert of those ocean solitudes,"
446,PART 2.,"But vocal to the sea-bird's harrowing shriek,"
447,PART 2.,"The bellowing monster, and the rushing storm,"
448,PART 2.,Now to the sweet and many-mingling sounds                   395
449,PART 2.,Of kindliest human impulses respond:
450,PART 2.,"Those lonely realms bright garden-isles begem,"
451,PART 2.,"With lightsome clouds and shining seas between,"
452,PART 2.,"And fertile valleys resonant with bliss,"
453,PART 2.,"Whilst green woods overcanopy the wave,                     400"
454,PART 2.,"Which like a toil-worn labourer leaps to shore,"
455,PART 2.,To meet the kisses of the flowerets there.
456,PART 2.,
457,PART 2.,"Man chief perceives the change, his being notes"
458,PART 2.,"The gradual renovation, and defines"
459,PART 2.,Each movement of its progress on his mind.                  405
460,PART 2.,"Man, where the gloom of the long polar night"
461,PART 2.,"Lowered o'er the snow-clad rocks and frozen soil,"
462,PART 2.,Where scarce the hardiest herb that braves the frost
463,PART 2.,"Basked in the moonlight's ineffectual glow,"
464,PART 2.,"Shrank with the plants, and darkened with the night;        410"
465,PART 2.,Nor where the tropics bound the realms of day
466,PART 2.,"With a broad belt of mingling cloud and flame,"
467,PART 2.,Where blue mists through the unmoving atmosphere
468,PART 2.,"Scattered the seeds of pestilence, and fed"
469,PART 2.,"Unnatural vegetation, where the land                        415"
470,PART 2.,"Teemed with all earthquake, tempest and disease,"
471,PART 2.,Was man a nobler being; slavery
472,PART 2.,Had crushed him to his country's blood-stained dust.
473,PART 2.,
474,PART 2.,Even where the milder zone afforded man
475,PART 2.,"A seeming shelter, yet contagion there,                     420"
476,PART 2.,"Blighting his being with unnumbered ills,"
477,PART 2.,Spread like a quenchless fire; nor truth availed
478,PART 2.,"Till late to arrest its progress, or create"
479,PART 2.,That peace which first in bloodless victory waved
480,PART 2.,Her snowy standard o'er this favoured clime:                425
481,PART 2.,"There man was long the train-bearer of slaves,"
482,PART 2.,"The mimic of surrounding misery,"
483,PART 2.,"The jackal of ambition's lion-rage,"
484,PART 2.,The bloodhound of religion's hungry zeal.
485,PART 2.,
486,PART 2.,Here now the human being stands adorning                  430
487,PART 2.,This loveliest earth with taintless body and mind;
488,PART 2.,"Blest from his birth with all bland impulses,"
489,PART 2.,Which gently in his noble bosom wake
490,PART 2.,All kindly passions and all pure desires.
491,PART 2.,"Him, still from hope to hope the bliss pursuing,            435"
492,PART 2.,Which from the exhaustless lore of human weal
493,PART 2.,"Dawns on the virtuous mind, the thoughts that rise"
494,PART 2.,In time-destroying infiniteness gift
495,PART 2.,"With self-enshrined eternity, that mocks"
496,PART 2.,"The unprevailing hoariness of age,                          440"
497,PART 2.,"And man, once fleeting o'er the transient scene"
498,PART 2.,"Swift as an unremembered vision, stands"
499,PART 2.,Immortal upon earth: no longer now
500,PART 2.,He slays the beast that sports around his dwelling
501,PART 2.,"And horribly devours its mangled flesh,                     445"
502,PART 2.,"Or drinks its vital blood, which like a stream"
503,PART 2.,Of poison thro' his fevered veins did flow
504,PART 2.,Feeding a plague that secretly consumed
505,PART 2.,"His feeble frame, and kindling in his mind"
506,PART 2.,"Hatred, despair, and fear and vain belief,                  450"
507,PART 2.,"The germs of misery, death, disease and crime."
508,PART 2.,"No longer now the winged habitants,"
509,PART 2.,"That in the woods their sweet lives sing away,"
510,PART 2.,"Flee from the form of man; but gather round,"
511,PART 2.,And prune their sunny feathers on the hands                 455
512,PART 2.,Which little children stretch in friendly sport
513,PART 2.,Towards these dreadless partners of their play.
514,PART 2.,All things are void of terror: man has lost
515,PART 2.,"His desolating privilege, and stands"
516,PART 2.,An equal amidst equals: happiness                           460
517,PART 2.,And science dawn though late upon the earth;
518,PART 2.,"Peace cheers the mind, health renovates the frame;"
519,PART 2.,"Disease and pleasure cease to mingle here,"
520,PART 2.,Reason and passion cease to combat there;
521,PART 2.,Whilst mind unfettered o'er the earth extends               465
522,PART 2.,"Its all-subduing energies, and wields"
523,PART 2.,The sceptre of a vast dominion there.
524,PART 2.,
525,PART 2.,Mild is the slow necessity of death:
526,PART 2.,"The tranquil spirit fails beneath its grasp,"
527,PART 2.,"Without a groan, almost without a fear,                     470"
528,PART 2.,"Resigned in peace to the necessity,"

532,PART 2.,"Waste in the human frame, and Nature gifts                  475"
533,PART 2.,With choicest boons her human worshippers.
534,PART 2.,How vigorous now the athletic form of age!
535,PART 2.,How clear its open and unwrinkled brow!
536,PART 2.,"Where neither avarice, cunning, pride, or care,"
537,PART 2.,Had stamped the seal of grey deformity                      480
538,PART 2.,On all the mingling lineaments of time.
539,PART 2.,How lovely the intrepid front of youth!
540,PART 2.,How sweet the smiles of taintless infancy.
541,PART 2.,
542,PART 2.,"Within the massy prison's mouldering courts,"
543,PART 2.,"Fearless and free the ruddy children play,                  485"
544,PART 2.,Weaving gay chaplets for their innocent brows
545,PART 2.,"With the green ivy and the red wall-flower,"
546,PART 2.,That mock the dungeon's unavailing gloom;
547,PART 2.,"The ponderous chains, and gratings of strong iron,"
548,PART 2.,There rust amid the accumulated ruins                       490
549,PART 2.,Now mingling slowly with their native earth:
550,PART 2.,"There the broad beam of day, which feebly once"
551,PART 2.,Lighted the cheek of lean captivity
552,PART 2.,"With a pale and sickly glare, now freely shines"
553,PART 2.,On the pure smiles of infant playfulness:                   495
554,PART 2.,No more the shuddering voice of hoarse despair
555,PART 2.,"Peals through the echoing vaults, but soothing notes"
556,PART 2.,Of ivy-fingered winds and gladsome birds
557,PART 2.,And merriment are resonant around.
558,PART 2.,
559,PART 2.,The fanes of Fear and Falsehood hear no more              500
560,PART 2.,The voice that once waked multitudes to war
561,PART 2.,Thundering thro' all their aisles: but now respond
562,PART 2.,To the death dirge of the melancholy wind:
563,PART 2.,It were a sight of awfulness to see
564,PART 2.,"The works of faith and slavery, so vast,                    505"
565,PART 2.,"So sumptuous, yet withal so perishing!"
566,PART 2.,Even as the corpse that rests beneath their wall.
567,PART 2.,A thousand mourners deck the pomp of death
568,PART 2.,"To-day, the breathing marble glows above"
569,PART 2.,"To decorate its memory, and tongues                         510"
570,PART 2.,"Are busy of its life: to-morrow, worms"
571,PART 2.,In silence and in darkness seize their prey.
572,PART 2.,These ruins soon leave not a wreck behind:
573,PART 2.,"Their elements, wide-scattered o'er the globe,"
574,PART 2.,"To happier shapes are moulded, and become                   515"
575,PART 2.,Ministrant to all blissful impulses:
576,PART 2.,"Thus human things are perfected, and earth,"
577,PART 2.,"Even as a child beneath its mother's love,"
578,PART 2.,"Is strengthened in all excellence, and grows"
579,PART 2.,Fairer and nobler with each passing year.                   520
580,PART 2.,
581,PART 2.,Now Time his dusky pennons o'er the scene
582,PART 2.,"Closes in steadfast darkness, and the past"
583,PART 2.,Fades from our charmed sight. My task is done:
584,PART 2.,"Thy lore is learned. Earth's wonders are thine own,"
585,PART 2.,With all the fear and all the hope they bring.              525
586,PART 2.,My spells are past: the present now recurs.
587,PART 2.,Ah me! a pathless wilderness remains
588,PART 2.,Yet unsubdued by man's reclaiming hand.
589,PART 2.,
590,PART 2.,"Yet, human Spirit, bravely hold thy course,"
591,PART 2.,Let virtue teach thee firmly to pursue                      530
592,PART 2.,The gradual paths of an aspiring change:
593,PART 2.,"For birth and life and death, and that strange state"
594,PART 2.,Before the naked powers that thro' the world
595,PART 2.,"Wander like winds have found a human home,"
596,PART 2.,"All tend to perfect happiness, and urge                     535"
597,PART 2.,"The restless wheels of being on their way,"
598,PART 2.,"Whose flashing spokes, instinct with infinite life,"
599,PART 2.,Bicker and burn to gain their destined goal:
600,PART 2.,For birth but wakes the universal mind
601,PART 2.,Whose mighty streams might else in silence flow             540
602,PART 2.,"Thro' the vast world, to individual sense"
603,PART 2.,"Of outward shows, whose unexperienced shape"
604,PART 2.,New modes of passion to its frame may lend;
605,PART 2.,"Life is its state of action, and the store"
606,PART 2.,Of all events is aggregated there                           545
607,PART 2.,That variegate the eternal universe;
608,PART 2.,"Death is a gate of dreariness and gloom,"
609,PART 2.,That leads to azure isles and beaming skies
610,PART 2.,And happy regions of eternal hope.
611,PART 2.,"Therefore, O Spirit! fearlessly bear on:                    550"
612,PART 2.,"Though storms may break the primrose on its stalk,"
613,PART 2.,"Though frosts may blight the freshness of its bloom,"
614,PART 2.,"Yet spring's awakening breath will woo the earth,"
615,PART 2.,"To feed with kindliest dews its favourite flower,"
616,PART 2.,"That blooms in mossy banks and darksome glens,              555"
617,PART 2.,Lighting the green wood with its sunny smile.
618,PART 2.,
619,PART 2.,"Fear not then, Spirit, death's disrobing hand,"
620,PART 2.,"So welcome when the tyrant is awake,"
621,PART 2.,So welcome when the bigot's hell-torch flares;
622,PART 2.,"'Tis but the voyage of a darksome hour,                     560"
623,PART 2.,The transient gulf-dream of a startling sleep.
624,PART 2.,"For what thou art shall perish utterly,"
625,PART 2.,But what is thine may never cease to be;
626,PART 2.,Death is no foe to virtue: earth has seen
627,PART 2.,"Love's brightest roses on the scaffold bloom,               565"
628,PART 2.,"Mingling with freedom's fadeless laurels there,"
629,PART 2.,And presaging the truth of visioned bliss.
630,PART 2.,"Are there not hopes within thee, which this scene"
631,PART 2.,Of linked and gradual being has confirmed?
632,PART 2.,"Hopes that not vainly thou, and living fires                570"
633,PART 2.,"Of mind as radiant and as pure as thou,"
634,PART 2.,"Have shone upon the paths of men--return,"

637,PART 2.,"With tyranny and falsehood, and uproot                      575"
638,PART 2.,The germs of misery from the human heart.
639,PART 2.,Thine is the hand whose piety would soothe
640,PART 2.,"The thorny pillow of unhappy crime,"
641,PART 2.,"Whose impotence an easy pardon gains,"
642,PART 2.,Watching its wanderings as a friend's disease:              580
643,PART 2.,Thine is the brow whose mildness would defy
644,PART 2.,"Its fiercest rage, and brave its sternest will,"
645,PART 2.,When fenced by power and master of the world.
646,PART 2.,"Thou art sincere and good; of resolute mind,"
647,PART 2.,"Free from heart-withering custom's cold control,            585"
648,PART 2.,"Of passion lofty, pure and unsubdued."
649,PART 2.,"Earth's pride and meanness could not vanquish thee,"

659,PART 2.,The Daemon called its winged ministers.
660,PART 2.,"Speechless with bliss the Spirit mounts the car,"

664,PART 2.,The steep descent of Heaven's untrodden way.
665,PART 2.,Fast and far the chariot flew:
666,PART 2.,The mighty globes that rolled
667,PART 2.,Around the gate of the Eternal Fane
668,PART 2.,"Lessened by slow degrees, and soon appeared                 605"
669,PART 2.,Such tiny twinklers as the planet orbs
670,PART 2.,That ministering on the solar power
671,PART 2.,With borrowed light pursued their narrower way.
