133,I,Poets have wrongd poor storms: such days are best;
134,I,"They purge the air without, within the breast."

136,I,George Herbert

138,I,
139,I,
140,I,Cultural Misappropriation
141,I,
142,I,"is that what I hear you cry, citizen?"
143,I,If a delph-glazed moon with its O so
144,I,"delicate pattern pans over Holland, flat as"
145,I,"a tack, it also comes by way of the"
146,I,Antarctic circle right to your doorstep
147,I,in equal measure. If the sun clamps
148,I,"its golden torque on mosque or synagogue, pa,"
149,I,"cathedral or sacred site, does this endorse"
150,I,any one people over another? Is it your wish
151,I,to head off the cultural bandits at the
152,I,"historical impasse, citizen, by placing a"
153,I,patent on your mana? Beware the polemicists
154,I,"who define and so divide, who aggregate"
155,I,authority unto self where before lay none.
156,I,Symbol becomes the circumference of
157,I,"time & custom. It is not the thing itself,"
158,I,but the beautiful echo of a peoples harmonic
159,I,which cannot be bounded nor weakened.
160,I,Here lies the camouflage that protects the
161,I,"ancient matrix, the silent memory of our"
162,I,bloods journey & sound leads you to it.
163,I,
164,I,
165,I,
166,I,Word Maps
167,I,
168,I,1. Down By The River
169,I,
170,I,"Of the brain, mushroom shaped as"
171,I,"bomb blast, we project the image to"
172,I,"fact; up river from the torrent,"
173,I,"amongst the calmness of boulders, the"
174,I,angler shadow-casts looping
175,I,the steady surface for the archetypal
176,I,fish whose leapt arch anticipates t
177,I,but the headwaters are held greyly
178,I,back by a concrete-net on this
179,I,dappled and uncaptured urban afternoon.
180,I,He deftly flicks & spools back and
181,I,forth from channel to channel.
182,I,

184,I,
185,I,2. National Park Holiday
186,I,
187,I,If you go into the woods
188,I,today you will be part of a task
189,I,force moving in line-formation.
190,I,You will allow that the plastic yellow
191,I,tape which cordons off select
192,I,areas does not imply a Sacred Grove.
193,I,If you go into the woods
194,I,"today, disinterment, not picnics,"
195,I,is the order of inquiry. The
196,I,Vegetable Kingdom remains thoroughly
197,I,documented and every species is
198,I,accounted for; some of whom are
199,I,"human, or parts thereof."
200,I,
201,I,
202,I,3. False Idols
203,I,
204,I,"It was always wood, wood"
205,I,"along the way, and exits went from"
206,I,grove to sacred grove till deeper wood
207,I,lay beyond the Roman shield and sword;
208,I,"that, though, belongs to another"
209,I,picture book. The lyre-bird mimics the
210,I,chainsaw and Birds of Paradise
211,I,spit chips. Along the Hume Hwy. east
212,I,"of Eden, a concrete Mountain Ash"
213,I,dubbed Yggdrasil boasts a
214,I,wide-screen computer enhanced vista:
215,I,an arrow-straight monorail running
216,I,from Uluru clean through the Olgas.
217,I,
218,I,
219,I,4. Surveyors Party
220,I,
221,I,These twin obelisks which guard
222,I,the southern entrance to the Great Sandy
223,I,"desert, though partnered to a sun"
224,I,fiercer than anything Egypt had to
225,I,"offer, preside over a millennia of flat"
226,I,"emptiness, and attest to the prowess,"
227,I,"not of indigent cultures, but the"
228,I,engineering whim of the LAND BARONS
229,I,"who pray that one day, these too, will"
230,I,invoke an air-conditioned resort for
231,I,"the rich to dwell in, amongst hydro-"
232,I,"mythological fountains, playing"
233,I,endlessly over sacred-site motifs.
234,I,
235,I,
236,I,5.  Got Ourselves A Convoy!
237,I,
238,I,Hi Ho! Hi Ho! But theyve been
239,I,"laid off. Round Oberon, the town"
240,I,spirit flat as a plank; then fury knots
241,I,in pubs. The big rigs aim chrome
242,I,"cowlings at Canberra, Convoy! through"
243,I,the ring roads to circle Parliament House
244,I,"wagon-style. Hey, you cant knock"
245,I,it: logging by generations for
246,I,generations have trod them down. Count
247,I,the rings of the rigs revving. Each
248,I,"logger raw-red, necks blood-throttled."
249,I,"Say what, anger? You can put a ring"
250,I,"around that, champ. Hi Ho! Hi Ho!"
251,I,
252,I,
253,I,6. Cultural Desert
254,I,
255,I,The earth is dismembered & what
256,I,remains gives evidence; clues: history
257,I,by blocks displaced as in the Aswan
258,I,Dam & the Temple of Philae. Osiris rolls
259,I,in the winding sheet of the Nile
260,I,(O moisture of the World!) and vainly
261,I,cry the well-wishers. Richard Burton
262,I,tracked the source back to Lake
263,I,"Victoria, and back again to the Royal"
264,I,Geographical Society; no gushing
265,I,"waters from the cleft rock, only lameness,"
266,I,"fever under the rays of the Sun God, Ra."
267,I,
268,I,
269,I,7. Down By The Station
270,I,
271,I,Indecision. Doubt. A bungled
272,I,"liftoff, the bumpy landing. Of course,"
273,I,the forest dwellers who continuously
274,I,run at you from tangled undergrowth
275,I,"onto the stubbled airstrip, dreamlike,"
276,I,dont make it: LAST CANNIBAL WORLD:
277,I,lithe tribal girl hand jobs hero through
278,I,bamboo cage. The spiked wooden ball
279,I,swishes from tree canopy to impale
280,I,support cast. Sunday matinee in country
281,I,town. Farm boys lope under dirty clouds
282,I,"to crop-dusted paddocks, and water"
283,I,"slips by the BP Service Station, somewhere."
284,I,
285,I,
286,I,8. Continental Shelf Co.
287,I,
288,I,I officially declare the millennial
289,I,Poets Symposium on the Age of Inner
290,I,Space now open: Welcome to OCEANISM.
291,I,Poets are required to be proficient
292,I,in submarine mythology of an exploratory
293,I,"and Cousteauesque manner, able to"
294,I,identify myriad life-forms luminescent yet
295,I,"undiscovered (except, perhaps, for the"
296,I,"Vampire Squid) at depths unsounded, in"
297,I,"sea trenches unknown, free, hopefully of"
298,I,maritime wrecks & missiles from any epoch;
299,I,whose task it is to float lines at once
300,I,"filigreed as plankton, filtered as sunlight."
301,I,
302,I,
303,I,9. Three Cheers The Militia!
304,I,
305,I,What plays us back - death? That
306,I,this worlds a stage and we upon it act
307,I,to revolve the scenery with our yearning:
308,I,"and while the syrinx play, panic rebounds"
309,I,to the dead cry: ET IN ARCADIA EGO
310,I,from the walled garden and far wilderness.
311,I,O desert! O armour-plated sun!
312,I,Under a scornful wind the madmen bellow
313,I,"and tribes cower amongst the rubble,"
314,I,caught in the sound bites & grabs of war:
315,I,"Tibet, Chechnya, Kurdistan, Iraq, Burundi,"
316,I,plus the boys in the hills back of Montana.
317,I,
318,I,
319,I,10. Video Conference
320,I,
321,I,Like a hurried geology that
322,I,arose out off glasshouses came the
323,I,"skyscrapers; meanwhile, History"
324,I,cut a swathe through the Natural World
325,I,and architecture strove to regain it.
326,I,"Lost to the familiar, Age moved us"
327,I,"out of living memory, unlike those tribes,"
328,I,the autochthons who saw the earths
329,I,"infancy still. Let us go, you & I,"
330,I,to re-invent the damage and call it
331,I,"discovery, to uniformly lift up our cry"
332,I,"in schadenfreude, meek before Great Cities"
333,I,that bend as fenders to the glare.
334,I,
335,I,
336,I,11. Crow Country
337,I,
338,I,"A field of wheat, a paddock of"
339,I,"stubble, the chafed dust-cloud staggers"
340,I,"the pick-up at distance, the Rock"
341,I,of Ages rises over Plainville: pop:
342,I,"dead serious. No hermits, only"
343,I,the bowing pumps facing west for oil.
344,I,Family photos hang easy next to
345,I,the semiautomatic in each clapboard.
346,I,The Long Horn Saloon boasts the
347,I,one rule: NO SPITTING. NO STRANGERS.
348,I,The hard hats passed round every
349,I,Sunday and the big fists knuckle under
350,I,prayer & flag real righteous like.
351,I,
352,I,
353,I,12. Hills Of Home
354,I,
355,I,"Greywacke mostly, & fat pale"
356,I,clay where I troubled the hills about
357,I,Wellington (Brooklyn-west) that
358,I,you dug through to reach China as a
359,I,kid out-the-back of our place.
360,I,"The gorse gully and yellow flowers,"
361,I,black seed-pods bursting in the summer
362,I,heat. Down you went past broken
363,I,bottled glass to the untouched cool
364,I,clay hoping any moment to pot hole up
365,I,into a paddy field through the
366,I,earths centre. Every failed dig
367,I,"stayed a secret from adults, forever."
368,I,
369,I,
370,I,13. Eco-Tourism
371,I,
372,I,Welcome to Smeltback Inc.
373,I,"copper, zinc, lead, uranium, iron,"
374,I,O mineral gardens of the Inland Sea!
375,I,A company satellite tremulous as
376,I,a divining-rod maps onto flow charts
377,I,corporate terrain; prospectus
378,I,for all the kingdoms of the earth.
379,I,Radio Redneck pumps the poet
380,I,"who banks safe on a right-wing bet,"
381,I,steadies to subvert the norm
382,I,for God and Clever Countrys sake.
383,I,Prettily thus he underbends the knee
384,I,to throw his best foot forward O.
385,I,
386,I,
387,I,
388,I,Generation of 68
389,I,
390,I,Frank OHara (here Im skating slow
391,I,on sacred ice) has got a lot to answer
392,I,"for, yet who hasnt? Take the legacy"
393,I,"of 60s poets, for example, who cant"
394,I,help but write like him; syntactically
395,I,"careering around his blizzard of words,"
396,I,"elbow-jolting crazily, clutching at"
397,I,"each others earmuffs, buttonholing"
398,I,opportunity. Seems they did that as
399,I,par for the course till it got too dizzy.
400,I,Round and round the freedom rink they
401,I,went & those who zigzagged quick & cut
402,I,up rough fell back upon the railings
403,I,"youth exhausted to exhale worn, cautious"
404,I,success  though tried not to show it.
405,I,What happened to the stragglers in the
406,I,"maul is anyones guess; some unmarried,"
407,I,a good number courted hardship  whatever.
408,I,Nobody cares overly much. The 60s poets
409,I,they go on to write like Frank OHara:
410,I,"fewer drop-by parties, meaner somehow."
411,I,
412,I,
413,I,
414,I,Pat Boone & Tonto
415,I,
416,I,White-shirted (not blue)
417,I,they approach in twos:
418,I,"Excuse me Sir, a small"
419,I,moment of your time?
420,I,Soft-selling eternity &
421,I,the clean-cut hereafter.
422,I,The boyish accent downloads
423,I,the serious side of the
424,I,"American dream, eyes fixed"
425,I,computer bright. The other
426,I,"is slower, slope-shouldered"
427,I,"& discipled, backgrounded"
428,I,by a blandished brain.
429,I,"As a child, when the God"
430,I,"was always friendly,"
431,I,"big as a house, long as a"
432,I,"street & the day endless,"
433,I,the knock upon the door
434,I,signalled: Excuse me
435,I,"young man, is the lady of"
436,I,the house in? Welcome
437,I,the suitcased salesman; the
438,I,"Bon-Brush Man: big-bristled,"
439,I,wooden-backed scrubbing
440,I,"& bottle brushes, sandsoap"
441,I,& Brasso for hard domestic
442,I,usage. Not now. These two
443,I,modern peddlers head out
444,I,to the brick bungalows of
445,I,the inner city suburbs
446,I,"selling the Light & the Way,"
447,I,galloping round the outer
448,I,handicapped districts;
449,I,brainwashed right-wing angels
450,I,confident as professional
451,I,sportsmen on a World Tour.
452,I,
453,I,
454,I,
455,I,To Talk of Flags
456,I,
457,I,"The flags fall like large, hollow,"
458,I,"monochrome leaves, said Ritsos, but"
459,I,this isnt Greece. How can you talk of
460,I,changing flags as blithely as you
461,I,would a marriage? When we fly the flag
462,I,"its as label to proclaim attitude,"
463,I,"and rightly so, too: the Remembrance"
464,I,"Day Parades, Expansionism, other"
465,I,peoples wars; the main street of every
466,I,country town at the dying of day lights
467,I,up the Unknown Soldier & the long
468,I,"lists of the Dead written in lead. No,"
469,I,"these things will always hold, rung up"
470,I,"once yearly, regular as a poker-machine."
471,I,"Change flags, to acknowledge what? Whose"
472,I,"domestic honour, what custodial deaths?"
473,I,

478,I,An exiles soliloquy
479,I,
480,I,
481,I,Henley Pub? I am one year from
482,I,"your death, and a mad mile from your"
483,I,achievement twenty or so years
484,I,down the track. I think you may have
485,I,"killed a few of us off, brother,"
486,I,who rejoiced
487,I,"in your thicket of sorrows. Jim Baxter,"
488,I,if a cabbage tree marks your spot by
489,I,"the river,"
490,I,I am glad of it.
491,I,"After you went, we were too eager"
492,I,"for another Apollo, and the laurel"
493,I,was tossed from
494,I,hand to poetic hand like a hot kumara.
495,I,Most dropped it. A number were swept
496,I,by the winter river with the eels
497,I,into the Underworld.The God Love
498,I,and the God Vengeance sat down
499,I,in a burnt out warehouse to share out the
500,I,small morsels
501,I,of pain.
502,I,The poets are playing hide-and-seek
503,I,with each other in and out of marriage.
504,I,The sharing is done.
505,I,A southerly
506,I,whistles up over the gun emplacements on
507,I,"Brooklyn Hill,Jim, scattering"
508,I,the unposted Autumn leaves.
509,I,
510,I,
511,I,
512,I,Christmas
513,I,
514,I,Under the mining operations of
515,I,"the moon, continental drifts of cloud"
516,I,collude and a pelican scaffolds

1064,I,"all over Sydney except Vine street,"
1065,I,"Darlington, where Darcy the Crim lived"
1066,I,& the most dangerous place in town.
1067,I,I came to Austinmer 30 years ago
1068,I,before the Wardrobe Drinkers
1069,I,in the days of the miners & cottages.
1070,I,Take those grain & coal carriers
1071,I,"upwards of 250,000 tonnes with a 12"
1072,I,"man crew, anchored stern to wind,"
1073,I,off Hill 60 out of Port Kembla

1082,I,
1083,I,out of Port Moresby. The obese
1084,I,Oxford villain tumbles overboard
1085,I,speared by the fuzzy-wuzzies. Our
1086,I,"hero, Captain Singleton, finally"
1087,I,
1088,I,
1089,I,puts his shirt back on and tilts
1090,I,his cap to the sunset. He places one
1091,I,arm around his sweetheart and the
1092,I,other at the helm. The sea falls into
1093,I,
1094,I,
1095,I,"suburbs of light, a topiary of"
1096,I,Islands could be mist. He is American
1097,I,and at home in the world as he
1098,I,moves forward on the celluloid tides.
1099,I,
1100,I,
1101,I,He came out of sickness country

1110,I,
1111,I,shrieking like hyenas in
1112,I,their sexual mirth to the disco
1113,I,bang of Madonna making her
1114,I,mint in the sacrilegious from the
1115,I,"sacred. For some, perhaps, a"
1116,I,continuous custom to hang together
1117,I,whatever sense of family may
1118,I,be had once the wild oats
1119,I,have passed into the photograph album:
1120,I,"circa: June, in some tumbled month,"
1121,I,the garden hose spurting champagne
1122,I,"and the neighbour, suspect as"

1127,I,
1128,I,Joe Hammer makes his move on
1129,I,screen and the girl cries out for Mamma.
1130,I,A family of sperm packs up and moves
1131,I,house. The removal of limbs.
1132,I,The images dim to an impotent mauve
1133,I,and the stage act begins. Shes
1134,I,"only working warm, consistent as a"
1135,I,vibrator. She hopes one day
1136,I,to make big bucks; the conference
1137,I,"room, that is, before she hits twenty."
1138,I,The one spotlight fixes on
1139,I,the portico between her thighs.
1140,I,The audience soughs in the dark. Strippers
1141,I,"dont have no union, strippers dont."
1142,I,"O Karen, your smile, cool as a cucumber."

1146,I,
1147,I,Let us sing the rosellas who
1148,I,buckle under branches for the paper-bark
1149,I,"blossom, and the far distant shadows"
1150,I,on slate-roofs. Let us herald the
1151,I,"Children of God, the Family of Love,"
1152,I,progeny of the Jesus Freaks founded in
1153,I,"Oakland, California back in the 70s."
1154,I,"And this child, who believes"
1155,I,Bethlehem resides in her fourteen year
1156,I,old womb. Hers is the pioneering
1157,I,spirit caught in a spectral watercolour.
1158,I,"There she leans, under the guiding"
1159,I,"star of a single streetlight, while"
1160,I,bluestone clouds move away over

1165,I,
1166,I,in the presbytery is maxed out
1167,I,"from the exo-bike, beads of sweat drip"
1168,I,off his fingertips. He is purged
1169,I,of the last house-boy from the
1170,I,"jungle parish in Papua New Guinea, ten"
1171,I,years previous. He pounds at the
1172,I,peck-deck in his lounge room
1173,I,wishing the garden hand were an opera
1174,I,singer. Several repeats of the
1175,I,pole-twists and his bowels grunt like a
1176,I,sermon. A final glass of claret drops
1177,I,him to his knees ashen faced. His
1178,I,"big bath steams plump now, full"
1179,I,as the Jordan river. The one bedroom
1180,I,light burns on the lemon bush
1181,I,which holds its globes of fruit like

1191,I,The weird man in the moon falls to the
1192,I,night basket. Stars roll out
1193,I,another lottery and unemployment raises
1194,I,dust over the land. Tout est perdu
1195,I,fors lhonneur. Among thieves.
1196,I,Running with images I whirl out the
1197,I,rainbow. Spring flutters as the National
1198,I,flag to salute the pilot whales
1199,I,herding one more disastrous landing.
1200,I,Waves roll head-to-head round
1201,I,the plate of  The Great South Land.
1202,I,"Which way to Wynyard, calls"
1203,I,the currawong. Helicopters line up like
1204,I,magi over Bankstown. When you
1205,I,"look up,  that old full moon makes you"
1206,I,"feel like a cowpoke, dont it?"

1210,I,
1211,I,under a dusty-hulled moon out
1212,I,of an empty Hollywood lot placed there
1213,I,in the out-take of twilight. The
1214,I,bus families have arrived in convoy.
1215,I,Stolidly parked nearby in protest
1216,I,at two suburban parks up for auction in
1217,I,a depressed market. A couple of
1218,I,pitched tents and an Information Stand
1219,I,of press clippings. Kids play in a
1220,I,refuse pit between tossed aside railway
1221,I,sleepers. Slung about the Council
1222,I,Chambers fairy lights all a  twinkle since
1223,I,the last bi-election a year back;

1230,I,thats fine by me (William street in
1231,I,winter and pissing down is the pits)
1232,I,standing around in doorways waiting
1233,I,for some totally wasted guy  excuse me!
1234,I,its a trick is what it is  to
1235,I,slap his dumb meat between my thighs.
1236,I,"Hey, Im Jasmine though I dont"
1237,I,feel like one. Mostly bored.
1238,I,"On each hip Ive got this tattoo, says"
1239,I,Allan kind of smudgy & out of focus
1240,I,because its real old. The main
1241,I,man. A jerk off really in someone
1242,I,elses life. A lifer. Summers
1243,I,"shit, more noise and especially groups."
1244,I,For hours or however long it takes
1245,I,"& I do Spanish & French, but Im"
1246,I,better at French. Sometimes not much
1247,I,happens. Idle as a lizard pointing
1248,I,"brickwork on hot buildings, someone said."
1249,I,"I read in this magazine once,"
1250,I,(I meet all sorts) and this guy
1251,I,"says, nor can I say I love you"
1252,I,but a gentle calligraphy informs your
1253,I,brow. What a whacker! I know shit
1254,I,"from clay, he just reckoned he could get"
1255,I,away with saying nothing. Dickhead!
1256,I,Guys are like that with money
1257,I,like its some fucking secret.

1260,I,Who Killed Brett Whiteley
1261,I,
1262,I,"Actually, it was Lloyd Rees"
1263,I,killed off  Brett Whiteley who couldnt
1264,I,"live the promise of old age,"
1265,I,the calm terror of it. Thats what
1266,I,Rees meant in his letter to Brett:
1267,I,carry the torch forward
1268,I,and something about being a warrior
1269,I,"for Art. Brett, in fact, was"
1270,I,skittled by a high powered mix of
1271,I,narcissism & clown. Forget what
1272,I,"he had to, or couldnt leave behind &"
1273,I,anything to do with High Seriousness.
1274,I,He got caught up in latitudes
1275,I,of sex where the Olgas loomed round as
1276,I,buttocks. Brett became his own
1277,I,"myth when he died, and effectively"
1278,I,slammed the door on the 60s.
1279,I,"Maybe some other seascape, like Thera,"
1280,I,suggestive of broken altars;
1281,I,looking down into the cratered harbour
1282,I,he might have seen beneath the
1283,I,"lapis lazuli waters, an ivory"
1284,I,"scimitar held in the gaze of Portunus,"
1285,I,"perfectly preserved, snapped in two."

1296,I,"drive a 3"" nail through a"
1297,I,pound of butter
1298,I,
1299,I,
1300,I,you got the job

1302,I,Bob the Builder
1303,I,
1304,I,
1305,I,who shook the hand
1306,I,of Banjo Patterson though
1307,I,no-one believes him.

1311,I,finial or mullion round
1312,I,Boomi that hasnt
1313,I,
1314,I,

1318,I,
1319,I,
1320,I,When he couldnt
1321,I,make a deaner he went bumper

1323,I,
1324,I,
1325,I,way back before
1326,I,the Great War the first of the
1327,I,"street kids in Ultimo,"

1348,I,had lipstick bomber pilot red
1349,I,& nails the colour of flame.
1350,I,
1351,I,
1352,I,It was often elevenses in her lounge

1354,I,"THE GRAND HOTEL, DUNEDIN 1932 engraved"
1355,I,
1356,I,

1358,I,from the mahogany sideboard repository to dozens
1359,I,of weighty 78 jazz records in brown paper
1360,I,jackets stacked like so many ossified flapjacks.
1361,I,
1362,I,
1363,I,Oh she had the most beautiful hands (in her
1364,I,"day) they said, used for commercials in the"
1365,I,Womens Weekly & Booths the Chemists.

1367,I,

1369,I,mannequin thick
1370,I,
1371,I,not remember her gin-sweet
1372,I,breath warm upon the neck? And how some Yank
1373,I,billeted during WW2 (here) ducky!
1374,I,thought she was a real living doll.
1375,I,
1376,I,
1377,I,Oh such beautiful hands she had & the crystal light

1389,I,reading 12:30 twenty floors up in NYC
1390,I,dangling a gibbet jig on the ledge
1391,I,beneath his girl with the bob cut
1392,I,screaming soundlessly as he catapults
1393,I,past the big businessman whose fist
1394,I,is foreclosed like a bank on their
1395,I,undying love which against all odds is
1396,I,saved as he grabs at the flagpole
1397,I,angled stark as an erection from the
1398,I,side of the building on the way through
1399,I,the office window only to upset the
1400,I,cooler and startle the typing pool
1401,I,then back down the zigzag emergency
1402,I,exit skittling the fire-bucket to snatch
1403,I,the fire-hose & bungy jump down
1404,I,the side of the skyscraper while the
1405,I,keystone cops are toppling in omnibuses
1406,I,furiously toward the wrong address
1407,I,at odds with the clanging fire brigade
1408,I,a cavalry charge amongst a confusion
1409,I,of ladders & outsize helmets
1410,I,pointing the way into the fray
1411,I,continuously as down drops Harold free
1412,I,falling as only a spider can to be
1413,I,pulled up short one foot from the side
1414,I,walk under the canopied foyer entrance
1415,I,as darling thing hurtles into
1416,I,the stripy canvas awning where Harold
1417,I,catches her in his stiff upheld arms to

1421,I,
1422,I,Conrad & Wells & Co.
1423,I,
1424,I,Great to have met Joseph Conrad
1425,I,"or for that matter, HG Wells, who said,"
1426,I,Lets go upstairs and do nice things
1427,I,"with our bodies, and who did just"
1428,I,that to take a tilt at the waitress.
1429,I,"I saw them once, Conrad & Wells, in"
1430,I,"a photograph, standing together."
1431,I,A courtyard setting beside a few bamboo
1432,I,chairs. The hour was mild in a black
1433,I,"& white afternoon. Trees, too,"
1434,I,green galleons shipping oars in Autumn.
1435,I,"Conrad had, perhaps, cast off the last line"
1436,I,of a novel: the indigo lump upon the
1437,I,horizon is an Island: behind it the sun
1438,I,spilling its treasure trove: the rent
1439,I,"sailcloth of a sea-squall. Anyway,"
1440,I,he could still smell the coast wobble from
1441,I,"the deck of the Tartane, her weight"
1442,I,"to the wind. Wells, maybe, was thinking on"
1443,I,"socialism & science, and in some"
1444,I,"melancholic way of the waitress, she all"
1445,I,ascent. By what conversations did
1446,I,"they measure each other, these two voyagers"
1447,I,who possessed that sense of the bigness
1448,I,"of the world?  For Wells, an electrical"
1449,I,"spark that arced across the white page, and"
1450,I,"for Conrad, each word creaking on"
1451,I,"the blocks, the woman pale before the moon,"
1452,I,her eyes black as tornadoes at sea.

1461,I,corner of the matinee session on a Saturday
1462,I,afternoon flick with it might be Bus Stop
1463,I,Bev with one leg hooked in surrender
1464,I,over the front seat that youd think shes
1465,I,getting shod or something judging by the
1466,I,whinnying which could be some sort of scuffle

1471,I,bristling at each hip as he thunders
1472,I,round the dusty back lot who has just saved
1473,I,the stage coach with the backward spinning
1474,I,wheels out of last weeks cliffhanging
1475,I,disaster when over it went packed with
1476,I,the good townsfolk but it didnt all saved by
1477,I,the man in the black velvet with the silver
1478,I,studs & turkey gobble voice much to the hand
1479,I,pumping appreciation of the circuit judge
1480,I,too old to take the high jump & this
1481,I,real paternal dude takes it in his stride
1482,I,is off next week in search of the Lost
1483,I,Dutchmans Gold Mine as legend has it but
1484,I,not for long while Bully Boy will be
1485,I,back sweaty as a farrier with Lemonade Lil
1486,I,to catch what he can with Hoppy sure

1492,I,
1493,I,
1494,I,I called back down the unawakened
1495,I,dawn of the Tasman sea and along the East
1496,I,Coast from the pre-dawn light of
1497,I,"my sleep, I called out Bob Orr"
1498,I,soft as the punch of a howitzer to the
1499,I,Hokianga harbour & still further over the
1500,I,Waikatos billiard-table green paddocks.
1501,I,I hailed Bob to the Great Barrier
1502,I,"Island & Orr to the Little Barrier,"
1503,I,but no answer came chasing after. I
1504,I,sought you down the Harbour Heads &
1505,I,Hauraki Gulf then all about the Waitemata.
1506,I,I found a Thunderhead big as a
1507,I,container-load of sorrows & nowhere hard
1508,I,by were you toiling. Bob Orr I
1509,I,called from Meola Reef to the outlandish
1510,I,fishing-tackle cranes along the docks;
1511,I,"to Jellicoe wharf, Bledisloe wharf,"
1512,I,"Marsden wharf, Captain Cook wharf to the"
1513,I,Admiralty Steps hoping I would find
1514,I,you gazing out upon the glaucous slick of
1515,I,"trawlers, or catch you guiding a snub-"
1516,I,nosed tug under the Western Viaduct.
1517,I,Bob Orr I called down the unending
1518,I,"roadsteads to Motutapu & Rakino Islands,"
1519,I,back behind the wave screen at Okahu Bay
1520,I,to Freemans and St Marys Bay. And as
1521,I,I called into the Schooner Tavern &
1522,I,sought the drear interior of the Wynyard
1523,I,Tavern & the sailors talk told me
1524,I,you had fitted and trimmed your craft
1525,I,against every dire prediction to set sail
1526,I,"on that other sea, Bob, the one that"
1527,I,has no name & no horizon & is drowning you.
1528,I,
1529,I,

1531,I,Dave Spencer
1532,I,
1533,I,lived his life like barbed-wire
1534,I,"is what an old girlfriend said, man of"
1535,I,"the river. But then, life finished you"
1536,I,off bit-by-bit though couldnt pluck out
1537,I,"your dingo-bright eyes. Lets face it,"
1538,I,you were pretty much an arse-hole
1539,I,to those who knew you. Most of us just
1540,I,bash the trees without seeing the kangaroos.
1541,I,"You saw living mostly for what it is,"
1542,I,a part-time job with bugger all security;
1543,I,"the occasional softness of a woman,"
1544,I,"maybe, and of course grog by the bucketful."
1545,I,"What was it you saw at the last, Dave,"
1546,I,when passing through the ripped canvas of a
1547,I,"thunderstorm, lightning flashing down the"
1548,I,"Hawkesbury, a good belt of rain after?"
1549,I,
1550,I,
1551,I,
1552,I,You Dont Remember Dying
1553,I,
1554,I,"least, thats what the Old Londoner"
1555,I,told me who didnt learn to relax till well
1556,I,"past fifty, seated alongside his two"
1557,I,mates: a Norwegian: Youre not the same
1558,I,person now as you were ten years ago.
1559,I,And the Irishman: I like the music its

2043,VIII,Where once the melancholy bombs
2044,VIII,"from heaven fell to glut a village, 1000"
2045,VIII,grey cranes have returned to the Mekong
2046,VIII,Delta in the month of pure light.
2047,VIII,One herd of elephants also returned to
2048,VIII,the tropical jungle where before
2049,VIII,was none. A pure green is that light
2050,VIII,and not the green of crouching camouflage.
2051,VIII,"I bend to my past, for there is"
2052,VIII,a corner of the sky forever my childhood:
2053,VIII,Rupert Brooke frolics through the
2054,VIII,"soft Edwardian light with Virginia, and"
2055,VIII,dreams of fish-heaven. Bad William
2056,VIII,thumps the shit out of poor Aunty Ethel.
2057,VIII,
2058,VIII,Every poem is the last will &
2059,VIII,"testament of the soul, and every lover"
2060,VIII,who breaks from lover  a crime unto
2061,VIII,passion. Romance of the World!
2062,VIII,
2063,VIII,
2064,IX,IX
2065,IX,
2066,IX,Sun shines metallic off Footscray
2067,IX,and out across Westgate bridge. Silver &
2068,IX,green office blocks rise from a
2069,IX,"dun plain. Superman, bearing a stash of"
2070,IX,old money darts over the dockside
2071,IX,and the hidden sea home to Melbourne.
2072,IX,The thought of you adds weight
2073,IX,to new memory  sad as lamplight on rain
2074,IX,sodden guttering. Sadder still is the
2075,IX,"Romantic lapsed to obscenity,"
2076,IX,the swine tides that clog the spirit.
2077,IX,"Again, I drive my centre to the eye"
2078,IX,of your hurricane. Remember how
2079,IX,"the senses wrangled, anger like a vicious"
2080,IX,exorcism of betrayals not worded?
2081,IX,To run is to hide is to freely admit the
2082,IX,"hidden hurt. Volscian woman, we flung our"
2083,IX,fire at each other heavy as fists.
2084,IX,The old man sits in the park feeding
2085,IX,"pigeons; like his memories, they are"
2086,IX,grey-blue and flutter about him.
2087,IX,My memory of you from any perspective falls
2088,IX,along the flat face of this earth.
2089,IX,"No lamp lit up our consciousness,"
2090,IX,"only the blade figured the light, Psyche."
2091,IX,
2092,IX,The funeral of the sea
2093,IX,sings the Italian documentary. The
2094,IX,worlds rotting oil-fleet blanks
2095,IX,out the Mediterranean from the French
2096,IX,coast to the Bay of Naples. Six
2097,IX,hundred burning black candles turn crude
2098,IX,the Arab night and Red Adair pots
2099,IX,another well.  Oil Magnates!
2100,IX,Corporate Cowboys! Have you built your
2101,IX,"little ship of death, O have you?"
2102,IX,And there in the deep the Great Underwater
2103,IX,"Colonialist, Jacques Cousteau, laments"
2104,IX,"the dark night of the sea, his"
2105,IX,eyes are the colour of basalt.
2106,IX,Today we have part-time cloud & the
2107,IX,hours work at it cruel as barbed wire drawn
2108,IX,across the face of the moon.
2109,IX,What then is this other? It is
2110,IX,"the shadow personality, evil comes from"
2111,IX,the power of evil. It is the third
2112,IX,presence. O Romance of the World.
2113,IX,
2114,IX,
2115,X,X
2116,X,
2117,X,Crack of whips in substations
2118,X,and the horizon lights up like a
2119,X,Lucas/Spielberg movie. Tonight toward
2120,X,Blacktown helicopters make astrological
2121,X,"moves sideways.  Earlier, a trailblazer"
2122,X,made one Caesarean cut along the western
2123,X,sky. The 6 Oclock news brought with
2124,X,"it race riots & rapes, an eclipse"
2125,X,of weather which threatened the following
2126,X,"day, the unsteady peace of tomorrow."
2127,X,
2128,X,60 million hectares of saliferous
2129,X,"planet, and a new desert creeps toward"
2130,X,Central Europe. There is salt in
2131,X,the wound of the earth. Closer now comes
2132,X,the yearly pilgrimage with candle-flame
2133,X,of lava to light up Mt. Fuji in ninety-
2134,X,nine turns of the track. Refuse
2135,X,of light and all that glitters. As the
2136,X,Stealth Bomber slides East night advances
2137,X,"swift-footed over the Empire, over"
2138,X,the roll-call of the New World Order.
2139,X,
2140,X,Watch the southern sky shuffle
2141,X,the South China sea & galaxies thick as
2142,X,krill. Japanese fishing boats stack
2143,X,the decks with amputated fins by the tonne.
2144,X,Sharks loll dumb as torpedoes on waters
2145,X,flenched in blood. The Yugoslav
2146,X,Republics grow tired and another 25
2147,X,frames of tankfire roll off the screens
2148,X,from Croatia. Pain is the visible
2149,X,"urge to memory, says the Anchorperson."
2150,X,Radio KGB hits the airwaves with
2151,X,a global countdown from Tass and Reuter
2152,X,"& AAP. Back in Ontario, escalators whisper"
2153,X,to the underground shopping plazas
2154,X,and the Gallic snows fall loudest on Quebec.
2155,X,Frost at midnight lies as silent as
2156,X,"The American Dream,  and all along"
2157,X,the border night moves. This train
2158,X,dont run no more this train. Yo! This
2159,X,train dont run no more and Canadas
2160,X,"cut in half, calls David Suzuki. Hush now,"
2161,X,"the cyber-freaks sleep. Soundlessly,"
2162,X,the Hubble telescope gears its focus.
2163,X,

2165,XI,XI
2166,XI,
2167,XI,An extended mobile of galaxies.
2168,XI,"A prided installation. The dark, invisible"
2169,XI,matter of a riot in L.A. Three thousand
2170,XI,buildings ripple out flame in the
2171,XI,"city of Lost Angels. And then an open sky,"
2172,XI,a banquet of beads after fire hoses
2173,XI,roll out the light on any upright
2174,XI,surface. Hollywood Hills are alive with
2175,XI,the sound of security locks. The CNN
2176,XI,anchor-team is too well dressed for
2177,XI,"the maddening flames, in the sear, ongoing"
2178,XI,"segment of a news flash. In the break,"
2179,XI,"gathered the rain as pure as static,"
2180,XI,"unseen, but imagined whitely and curfew-wide."
2181,XI,Along the crippled streets in the blood
2182,XI,"blare of sirens, night arrived under"
2183,XI,the guise of the National Guard.
2184,XI,Heat rises from the grid of these sidewalks
2185,XI,"and the spirits of the Indian, afraid"
2186,XI,"enough of death to die, whoop it"
2187,XI,"up around the big campfires. I wake,"
2188,XI,"uncomfortable in the lurk of a dream, and"
2189,XI,my breath draws up hope like an
2190,XI,"anchor, lifts my thoughts into the day where"
2191,XI,I follow. Let us go (you & I) into
2192,XI,"the glow, hand in hand with Virtual Reality"
2193,XI,and idly make up war-games. Let us pray
2194,XI,that a supreme silence will be down-loaded
2195,XI,"at last. Moonrise, and a luminant coal"
2196,XI,sifts through the western grate of the world.
2197,XI,
2198,XI,"In cornfields elsewhere, so remembered"
2199,XI,"though not so high as an elephants eye,"
2200,XI,images pressed round as a hotplate
2201,XI,suggest some mystery or midnight vigil;
2202,XI,"this is what we wish, to stamp threat onto"
2203,XI,"the inexplicable, seeking out totems"
2204,XI,and to hold the dance of the primitive sacred:
2205,XI,"this city, too, let it stand as Icon."
2206,XI,
2207,XI,
2208,XII,XII
2209,XII,
2210,XII,O to wish upon a falling space
2211,XII,shuttle! The sky tries hard to reveal
2212,XII,"itself as bluestone, but temperature and"
2213,XII,wrappings of cloud are against it.
2214,XII,Rain falls hard as luck. Here you will
2215,XII,"see them lift up, a squadron of"
2216,XII,"pigeons swinging to gun the light, wings"
2217,XII,"ablaze, the bulky horizon thunderous"
2218,XII,where thunder lies cognisant.
2219,XII,The Great Dividing Range runs this way
2220,XII,and I am on the leeside toward the
2221,XII,sea. The setting sun awakens our
2222,XII,ancestral demand for bonfires
2223,XII,"big as cities, and a leisurely parade"
2224,XII,of gulls passing overhead mistake
2225,XII,the darkening hours for seacliffs.
2226,XII,
2227,XII,"These coastal towns boast the best burgers,"
2228,XII,the newest surf club  while the RSL
2229,XII,bends to the heavy metal swell which
2230,XII,runs the raft of every sea-slap
2231,XII,"every weekend. The short, broad streets"
2232,XII,are abandoned early to the blue
2233,XII,phosphorescence of the TV and the evening
2234,XII,"rustle of newspapers. Tomorrow,"
2235,XII,"of course, is uninhabited and fresh as a"
2236,XII,childs drawing.  Further on through
2237,XII,the minutes someone is hard at a hammer as
2238,XII,if wanting to be let in.  A news
2239,XII,bulletin tells of avenues long as decades
2240,XII,"in a steepled town where tanks gather,"
2241,XII,ready to break through a hay barn
2242,XII,in Kosovo. (Remember the Revolutionary
2243,XII,Poet who broke through a crowd?)
2244,XII,"No, this is only a rusted keel upended"
2245,XII,in the quarter-acre back yard. Not
2246,XII,by some turbulence round Cape Horn but
2247,XII,the tedium of a bankrupt dream loose as a
2248,XII,cloud. The family seams have now sprung
2249,XII,apart and the kids school the public
2250,XII,bars. A day in the round for the father who
2251,XII,breaks through the top-shelf like a
2252,XII,picket-line. At the local cinema watch the
2253,XII,"astronaut yawn, unaware the alien"
2254,XII,prepares to storm the spaceport wordless as
2255,XII,"a threat. Its dusk here, mist drowns"
2256,XII,"streetlights, the earth for a time puts aside"
2257,XII,"its hunger, and a delayed flight"
2258,XII,fills in for the evening star of Autumn.
