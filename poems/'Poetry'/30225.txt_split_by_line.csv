184,I,"Swept over me as, on the sounding prow"

220,IV,The old faith that tho gulfs sidereal stun

229,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,
230,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,(_In Japan_)
231,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,
232,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,
233,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,Where the fair golden idols
234,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,Sit in darkness and in silence
235,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,While the temple drum beats solemnly and slow;
236,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,Where the tall cryptomerias
237,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,Sway in worship round about
238,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,And the rain that is falling whispers low;
239,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,I can hear strange voices
240,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,"Of the dead and forgotten,"
241,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,On the dimly rising incense I can see
242,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,"The lives I have lived,"
243,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,"And my lives unbegotten,"
244,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,_Namu Amida Butsu_ pity me!
245,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,
246,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,I was born this karma
247,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,"Of a mother in Chuzenji,"
248,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,Where Nantai-zan looks down into the lake;
249,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,Where the white-thronged pilgrims
250,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,Climb to altars in the clouds
251,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,And behold the holy eastern dawn awake.
252,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,It was there I wandered
253,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,Till a priest of the Christians
254,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,With the crucifix he wore compelled my gaze.
255,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,"In grief I had grown,"
256,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,So upon its grief I pondered.
257,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,"_Namu Amida Butsu_, keep my days!"
258,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,
259,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,"It was wrong, he told me,"
260,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,"To pray Jiso for my children,"
261,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,And Binzuru for healing of my ills.
262,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,And our gods so many
263,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,"Were conceived, he said, in sin,"
264,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,From Lord Shaka to the least upon the hills.
265,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,In despair I listened
266,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,"For my heart beat hopeless,"
267,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,Not a temple of my land had helped me live.
268,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,But alas that day
269,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,When I let my soul be christened!
270,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,"_Namu Amida Butsu_, O forgive!"
271,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,
272,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,For the Christ they gave me
273,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,"As the only Law and Lotus,"
274,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,"As the only way to Light that will not wane,"
275,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,May perchance have power
276,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,"For the people of the West,"
277,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,But to me he seemed the servitor of pain.
278,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,For in pain he perished
279,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,As one born to passion:
280,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,"In some other life no doubt his sin was great,"
281,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,"Tho they told me no,"
282,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,Those who followed him and cherished.
283,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,"_Namu Amida Butsu_, such is fate."
284,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,
285,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,So again to idols
286,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,"Of the Buddha who is boundless,"
287,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,"While the temple drum is beating thro the rain,"
288,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,I have turned from treason
289,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,"Into Meditation's truth,"
290,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,From the strife the Western god regards as gain.
291,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,And if now I'm dying
292,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,"As the voices tell me,"
293,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,To the lives that I must live I'll meekly go;
294,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,Till my long grief ends
295,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,"In Nirvana, and my sighing."
296,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,"_Namu Amida Butsu_, be it so!"
297,THE PROSELYTE RECANTS,

394,TYPHOON,I was weary and slept on the Peak;
395,TYPHOON,"The air clung close like a shroud,"
396,TYPHOON,And ever the blue-fly's buzz in my ear
397,TYPHOON,Hung haunting and hot and loud;
398,TYPHOON,I awoke and the sky was dun
399,TYPHOON,With awe and a dread that soon
400,TYPHOON,"Went shuddering thro my heart, for I knew"
401,TYPHOON,That it meant typhoon! typhoon!
402,TYPHOON,
403,TYPHOON,"In the harbour below, far down,"
404,TYPHOON,The junks like fowl in a flock
405,TYPHOON,"Were tossing in wingless terror, or fled"

408,TYPHOON,"Of roofs, by the water strewn,"
409,TYPHOON,"Lay silent and waiting, yet there was none"
410,TYPHOON,Within it but said typhoon!
411,TYPHOON,
412,TYPHOON,"Then it came, like a million winds"
413,TYPHOON,"Gone mad immeasurably,"
414,TYPHOON,A torrid and tortuous tempest stung
415,TYPHOON,By rape of the fair South Sea.
416,TYPHOON,And it swept like a scud escaped
417,TYPHOON,"From craters of sun or moon,"
418,TYPHOON,"And struck as no power of Heaven could,"
419,TYPHOON,Or of Hell--typhoon! typhoon!

423,TYPHOON,"Or, dashed on the granite walls of the sea,"
424,TYPHOON,In succourless hundreds died.
425,TYPHOON,Till I shut the sight from my eyes

2108,MEREDITH,For not the mighty thunder
2109,MEREDITH,Of thy proud name from all the rocks
2110,MEREDITH,Of all the world can compensate
2111,MEREDITH,"A nation whom no Song makes glad,"
2112,MEREDITH,And whom no Seer makes great.
2113,MEREDITH,
2114,MEREDITH,

2117,THE END,
2118,THE END,
2119,THE END,
2120,THE END,
2121,THE END,
2122,THE END,
