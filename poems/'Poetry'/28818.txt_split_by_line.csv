28,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
29,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
30,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,It was the lofty Jutt of Bern
31,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,O'er all the walls he grew;
32,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"He was mad and ne'er at rest,"
33,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,To tame him no one knew.
34,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
35,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"He was mad and ne'er at rest,"
36,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,No lord could hold him in;
37,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,If he had long in Denmark stayed
38,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Much damage there had been.
39,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
40,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,It was the lofty Jutt of Bern
41,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Bound to his side his glaive,"
42,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,And away to the monarch's house he rode
43,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,With the knights a fray to have.
44,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
45,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Now goes the lofty Jutt of Bern
46,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Before the King to stand:
47,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Thou shalt to me thy daughter give,"
48,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,And a brief for half thy land.
49,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
50,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Here as thou sitt'st at thy wide board,"
51,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Hail Monarch of the Danes!
52,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Thou shalt to me thy daughter give,"
53,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,And the half of thy domains.
54,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
55,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Thou shalt to me thy daughter give,"
56,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"And divide with me thy land,"
57,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Or thou shalt find a kempion good
58,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"In the ring 'gainst me to stand."""
59,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
60,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""O thou shalt ne'er my daughter get,"
61,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Nor a brief for half my land,"
62,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,I'll quickly find a kempion good
63,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Shall fight thee hand to hand."""
64,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
65,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Then strode the Monarch of the Danes
66,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,To his castle hall amain:
67,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Now which of ye, my courtiers, will"
68,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,The lovely Damsel gain?
69,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
70,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Here sit ye all my Danish swains"
71,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"On whom I bread bestow,"
72,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Now which of ye will risk his life
73,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,To lay the Berner low?
74,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
75,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""I'll give to him my daughter dear,"
76,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"The wondrous lovely may,"
77,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Who in the ring with Jutt of Bern
78,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Shall dare the desperate fray."""
79,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
80,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"In silence all the kempions sat,"
81,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"None dared reply a word,"
82,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Except alone Orm Ungerswayne,"
83,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,The lowest at the board.
84,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
85,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Except alone Orm Ungerswayne,"
86,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,He bounded o'er the board:
87,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,I tell to ye in verity
88,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,He spake a manly word.
89,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
90,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Wilt thou to me thy daughter give,"
91,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,And divide with me thy land?
92,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"O then will I the kempion be,"
93,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Against the Jutt to stand.
94,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
95,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""And well will I your daughter win,"
96,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,And the prize alone will earn;
97,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,I am the lad to dare the fray
98,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"In the ring with the Jutt of Bern."""
99,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
100,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,It was the lofty Jutt of Bern
101,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,He o'er his shoulder glar'd:
102,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""O who may yonder mouseling be,"
103,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"From whom those words I heard?"""
104,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
105,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""No mouseling I, though call me, Jutt,"
106,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"A mouseling if you will,"
107,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,My father was good Sigurd King
108,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Who slumbers in his hill."""
109,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
110,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Ha! was thy sire good Sigurd King?"
111,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Thou'st something of his face,"
112,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Thou hast sprung up full wondrously
113,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"In fifteen winter's space."""
114,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
115,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,It was so late at evening tide
116,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"The sun had reached the wave,"
117,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,When Orm the youthful swain set out
118,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,To seek his father's grave.
119,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
120,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,It was the hour when grooms do ride
121,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"The coursers to the rill,"
122,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,That Orm set out resolved to wake
123,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,The dead man in the hill.
124,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
125,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Now strikes the bold Orm Ungerswayne
126,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"The hill with such a might,"
127,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,It was I ween a miracle
128,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,It tumbled not outright.
129,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
130,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Then stamped upon the hill so hard
131,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Young Orm with heavy foot,"
132,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,The arch was broke within the hill
133,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Which trembled to its root.
134,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
135,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Then from the hill Orm's father cried,"
136,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Where he so long had lain:
137,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""O cannot I in quiet lie"
138,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Within my murky den?
139,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
140,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Who dares so early break my rest,"
141,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,And troubleth thus my bones?
142,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Cannot I in quiet lie
143,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Beneath my roof of stones?
144,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
145,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Who seeks at night the dead man's hill"
146,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,And works this ruin all?
147,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Let him fear for now I swear
148,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"By Birting he shall fall."""
149,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
150,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""I am thy son, thy youngest son,"
151,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Thy Orm, O father dear;"
152,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,To beg a boon in mighty need
153,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"I come to seek thee here."""
154,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
155,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""If thou art Orm my youngest son,"
156,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"The kempion bold and brave,"
157,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Last year I gave to thee of gold,"
158,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"All, all thy heart could crave."""
159,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
160,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Last year you gave me store of gold"
161,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"On which I set no worth,"
162,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Now I this year must Birting have,"
163,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"The bravest sword on earth."""
164,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
165,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Never shalt thou Birting get"
166,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"To win the Monarch's daughter,"
167,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Until to Ireland thou hast been
168,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"To 'venge thy father's slaughter."""
169,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
170,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Give to me the Birting sword,"
171,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"And with it bid me thrive,"
172,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Or I the hill above thee will
173,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"To thousand pieces rive."""
174,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
175,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Stretch thou down thy hand and take"
176,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"My Birting from my side,"
177,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,But if thou break thy father's hill
178,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Much woe will thee betide."""
179,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
180,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"He cast to him the sword, its point"
181,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Appeared above the mould:
182,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Save good fate on thee shall wait"
183,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"I ne'er shall be consol'd."""
184,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
185,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"He reached to him the sword, and placed"
186,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Its hilt within his grasp:
187,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Beneath its blows may all thy foes"
188,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Before thee sink and grasp."""
189,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
190,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Then took the sword Orm Ungerswayne,"
191,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,And on his shoulder plac'd;
192,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"And to the Monarch's hall he sped,"
193,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,As fast as he could haste.
194,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
195,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,It was the lofty Jutt of Bern
196,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,With wrath was nearly wild:
197,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""It ill becomes a man like me"
198,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"To battle with a child."""
199,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
200,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Although I be but little, Jutt,"
201,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"A fearless heart I keep,"
202,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,And oftentimes a little hand
203,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"O'erturns a mighty heap."""
204,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
205,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"For two long days they fought, and when"
206,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"The third to evening tended,"
207,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Methinks,"" exclaim'd the Berner Jutt,"
208,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""This fight will ne'er be ended."""
209,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
210,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,It was bold Orm Ungerswayne
211,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"His good sword brandish'd he,"
212,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,And of the lofty Berner Jutt
213,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Asunder cut the knee.
214,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
215,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Loud bellowed then the Berner Jutt,"
216,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,And loud he fell to ban:
217,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""It ne'er was warrior custom yet"
218,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"So low to strike one's man."""
219,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
220,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""I was small, and thou wast tall,"
221,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Thy prowess I admire;
222,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,I only struck thy knee because
223,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"I could not reach thee higher."""
224,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
225,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Then took the bold Orm Ungerswayne
226,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"His faulchion on his back,"
227,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,And to the ocean strand he goes
228,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,As fast as he could make.
229,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
230,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,It was bold Orm Ungerswayne
231,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"He paced the yellow sand,"
232,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,And lo! Sir Tord of Valland came
233,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Swift sailing to the land.
234,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
235,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Foremost upon the gilded prow
236,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,The Tord of Valland stands:
237,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""O who is yonder little man"
238,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"That walks upon the sands?"""
239,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
240,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""O I am Orm, the youthful swain,"

248,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Beloved father thine."""
249,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
250,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,It was Tord of Valland then
251,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,With faulchion struck the earth:
252,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Never will I make amends"
253,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"By gold or money's worth."""
254,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
255,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"It was bold Orm Ungerswayne,"
256,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,He grasped his faulchion's hilt:
257,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""In vengeance for my father then"
258,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Shall valiant blood be spilt."""
259,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
260,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,It was the bold Orm Ungerswayne
261,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"He drew his trusty sword,"
262,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,And at a single blow smote off
263,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,The head of Valland's Tord.
264,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
265,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Valland's Tord he slew, and then"
266,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,His followers every one;
267,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Then speeds he to the monarch's house
268,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,To claim the maid he'd won.
269,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
270,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,Then took the bold Orm Ungerswayne
271,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,The Atheling in his arm:
272,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Thou art my own, fair maid, for thee"
273,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"I have confronted harm."""
274,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,
275,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,O'er Helmer Isle the tidings run
276,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"As fast as levin fire,"
