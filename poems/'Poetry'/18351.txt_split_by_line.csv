77,CONTENTS.,
78,CONTENTS.,
79,CONTENTS.,
80,CONTENTS.,
81,CONTENTS.,A Dream.
82,CONTENTS.,
83,CONTENTS.,I stood far off above the haunts of men
84,CONTENTS.,"Somewhere, I know not, when the sky was dim"
85,CONTENTS.,"From some worn glory, and the morning hymn"
86,CONTENTS.,Of the gay oriole echoed from the glen.
87,CONTENTS.,"Wandering, I felt earth's peace, nor knew I sought"
88,CONTENTS.,"A visioned face, a voice the wind had caught."
89,CONTENTS.,
90,CONTENTS.,"I passed the waking things that stirred and gazed,"
91,CONTENTS.,"Thought-bound, and heeded not; the waking flowers"
92,CONTENTS.,"Drank in the morning mist, dawn's tender showers,"
93,CONTENTS.,And looked forth for the Day-god who had blazed
94,CONTENTS.,His heart away and died at sundown. Far
95,CONTENTS.,In the gray west faded a loitering star.
96,CONTENTS.,
97,CONTENTS.,"It seemed that I had wandered through long years,"
98,CONTENTS.,"A life of years, still seeking gropingly"
99,CONTENTS.,A thing I dared not name; now I could see
100,CONTENTS.,"In the still dawn a hope, in the soft tears"
101,CONTENTS.,Of the deep-hearted violets a breath
102,CONTENTS.,"Of kinship, like the herald voice of Death."
103,CONTENTS.,
104,CONTENTS.,Slow moved the morning; where the hill was bare
105,CONTENTS.,Woke a reluctant breeze. Dimly I knew
106,CONTENTS.,My Day was come. The wind-blown blossoms threw
107,CONTENTS.,"Their breath about me, and the pine-swept air"
108,CONTENTS.,"Grew to a shape, a mighty, formless thing,"
109,CONTENTS.,A phantom of the wood's imagining.
110,CONTENTS.,
111,CONTENTS.,"And as I gazed, spell-bound, it seemed to move"
112,CONTENTS.,"Its tendril limbs, still swaying tremulously"
113,CONTENTS.,As if in spirit-doubt; then glad and free
114,CONTENTS.,Crystalled the being won from waiting grove
115,CONTENTS.,"Into a human likeness. There he stood,"
116,CONTENTS.,The vine-browed shape of Nature's mortal mood.
117,CONTENTS.,
118,CONTENTS.,"""Now have I found thee, Vision I have sought"
119,CONTENTS.,"These years, unknowing; surely thou art fair"
120,CONTENTS.,"And inly wise, and on thy tasselled hair"
121,CONTENTS.,Glows Heaven's own light. Passion and fame are naught
122,CONTENTS.,"To thy clear eyes, O Prince of many lands,--"
123,CONTENTS.,"Grant me thy joy,"" I cried, and stretched my hands."
124,CONTENTS.,
125,CONTENTS.,No answer but the flourish of the breeze
126,CONTENTS.,"Through the black pines. Then, slowly, as the wind"
127,CONTENTS.,"Parts the dense cloud-forms, leaving naught behind"
128,CONTENTS.,"But shapeless vapor, through the budding trees"
129,CONTENTS.,"Drifted some force unseen, and from my sight"
130,CONTENTS.,Faded my god into the morning light.
131,CONTENTS.,
132,CONTENTS.,"Again alone. With wistful, straining eyes"
133,CONTENTS.,"I waited, and the sunshine flecked the bank"
134,CONTENTS.,Happy with arbutus and violets where I sank
135,CONTENTS.,"Hearing, near by, a host of melodies,"
136,CONTENTS.,The rapture of the woodthrush; soft her mood
137,CONTENTS.,"The love-mate, with such golden numbers woo'd."
138,CONTENTS.,
139,CONTENTS.,He ceased; the fresh moss-odors filled the grove
140,CONTENTS.,"With a strange sweetness, the dark hemlock boughs"
141,CONTENTS.,"Moved soft, as though they heard the brooklet rouse"
142,CONTENTS.,"To its spring soul, and whisper low of love."
143,CONTENTS.,The white-robed birches stood unbendingly
144,CONTENTS.,"Like royal maids, in proud expectancy."
145,CONTENTS.,
146,CONTENTS.,Athwart the ramage where the young leaves press
147,CONTENTS.,"It came to me, ah, call it what you will"
148,CONTENTS.,"Vision or waking dream, I see it still!"
149,CONTENTS.,Again a form born of the woodland stress
150,CONTENTS.,"Grew to my gaze, and by some secret sign"
151,CONTENTS.,"Though shadow-hid, I knew the form was thine."
152,CONTENTS.,
153,CONTENTS.,The glancing sunlight made thy ruddy hair
154,CONTENTS.,"A crown of gold, but on thy spirit-face"
155,CONTENTS.,"There was no smile, only a tender grace"
156,CONTENTS.,Of love half doubt. Upon thy hand a rare
157,CONTENTS.,Wild bird of Paradise perched fearlessly
158,CONTENTS.,"With radiant plumage and still, lustrous eye."
159,CONTENTS.,
160,CONTENTS.,And as I gazed I saw what I had deemed
161,CONTENTS.,"A shadow near thy hand, a dusky wing,"
162,CONTENTS.,"A bird like last year's leaves, so dull a thing"
163,CONTENTS.,Beside its fellow; as the sunshine gleamed
164,CONTENTS.,"Each breast showed letters bright as crystalled rain,"
165,CONTENTS.,"The fair bird bore ""Delight,"" the other ""Pain."""
166,CONTENTS.,
167,CONTENTS.,"Then came thy voice: ""O Love, wilt have my gift?"""
168,CONTENTS.,I stretched my glad hands eagerly to grasp
169,CONTENTS.,"The heaven-blown bird, gold-hued, and longed to clasp"
170,CONTENTS.,It close and know it mine. Ere I might lift
171,CONTENTS.,The shining thing and hold it to my breast
172,CONTENTS.,Again I heard thy voice with vague unrest.
173,CONTENTS.,
174,CONTENTS.,"""These are twin birds and may not parted be."""
175,CONTENTS.,"Full in thine eyes I gazed, and read therein"
176,CONTENTS.,"The paradox of life, of love, of sin,"
177,CONTENTS.,As on a night of cloud and mystery
178,CONTENTS.,"One darting flash makes bright the hidden ways,"
179,CONTENTS.,And feet tread knowingly though thick the haze.
180,CONTENTS.,
181,CONTENTS.,"Thy gift, if so I chose,--no other hand"
182,CONTENTS.,Save thine.--I reached and gathered to my heart
183,CONTENTS.,"The quivering, sentient things.--Sometimes I start"
184,CONTENTS.,To know them hidden there.--If I should stand
185,CONTENTS.,"Idly, some day, and _one_,--God help me!--breast"
186,CONTENTS.,"A homing breeze,--my _brown_ bird knows _its_ nest."
187,CONTENTS.,
188,CONTENTS.,
189,CONTENTS.,
190,CONTENTS.,
191,CONTENTS.,Dream-Song.
192,CONTENTS.,
193,CONTENTS.,Cam'st thou not nigh to me
194,CONTENTS.,In that one glimpse of thee
195,CONTENTS.,"When thy lips, tremblingly,"
196,CONTENTS.,"Said: ""My Beloved."""
197,CONTENTS.,"'Twas but a moment's space,"
198,CONTENTS.,And in that crowded place
199,CONTENTS.,I dared not scan thy face
200,CONTENTS.,O! my Beloved.
201,CONTENTS.,
202,CONTENTS.,Yet there may come a time
203,CONTENTS.,(Though loving be a crime
204,CONTENTS.,Only allowed in rhyme
205,CONTENTS.,"To us, Beloved),"
206,CONTENTS.,When safe 'neath sheltering arm
207,CONTENTS.,"I may, without alarm,"
208,CONTENTS.,"Hear thy lips, close and warm,"
209,CONTENTS.,"Murmur: ""Beloved!"""
210,CONTENTS.,
211,CONTENTS.,
212,CONTENTS.,
213,CONTENTS.,
214,CONTENTS.,Doubt.
215,CONTENTS.,
216,CONTENTS.,"I do not know if all the fault be mine,"
217,CONTENTS.,Or why I may not think of thee and be
218,CONTENTS.,At peace with mine own heart. Unceasingly
219,CONTENTS.,"Grim doubts beset me, bygone words of thine"
220,CONTENTS.,"Take subtle meaning, and I cannot rest"
221,CONTENTS.,Till all my fears and follies are confessed.
222,CONTENTS.,
223,CONTENTS.,Perhaps the wild wind's questioning has brought
224,CONTENTS.,"My heart its melancholy, for, alone"
225,CONTENTS.,"In the night stillness, I can hear him moan"
226,CONTENTS.,"In sobbing gusts, as though he vainly sought"
227,CONTENTS.,Some bygone bliss. Against the dripping pane
228,CONTENTS.,In storm-blown torrents beats the driving rain.
229,CONTENTS.,
230,CONTENTS.,"Nay I will tell thee all, I will not hide"
231,CONTENTS.,"One thought from thee, and if I do thee wrong"
232,CONTENTS.,So much the more must I be brave and strong
233,CONTENTS.,To show my fault. And if thou then shouldst chide
234,CONTENTS.,I will accept reproof most willingly
235,CONTENTS.,So it but bringeth peace to thee and me.
236,CONTENTS.,
237,CONTENTS.,I dread thy past. Phantoms of other days
238,CONTENTS.,Pursue my vision. There are other hands
239,CONTENTS.,"Which thou hast held, perchance some slender bands"
240,CONTENTS.,That draw thee still to other woodland ways
241,CONTENTS.,"Than those which _we_ have known, some blissful hours"
242,CONTENTS.,"I do not share, of love, and June, and flowers."
243,CONTENTS.,
244,CONTENTS.,"I dread her most, that woman whom thou knewest"
245,CONTENTS.,"Those years ago,--I cannot bear to think"
246,CONTENTS.,"That she can say: ""My lover praised the pink"
247,CONTENTS.,"Of palm, or ear,"" ""The violets were bluest"
248,CONTENTS.,"In that dear copse,"" and dream of some fair day"
249,CONTENTS.,When thou didst while her summer hours away.
250,CONTENTS.,
251,CONTENTS.,"I dread them too, those light loves and desires"
252,CONTENTS.,That lie in the dim shadow of the years;
253,CONTENTS.,I fain would cheat myself of all my fears
254,CONTENTS.,"And, as a child watching warm winter fires,"
255,CONTENTS.,"Dream not of yesterday's black embers, nor"
256,CONTENTS.,To-morrow's ashes that may strew the floor.
257,CONTENTS.,
258,CONTENTS.,"I did not dream of this while thou wert near,"
259,CONTENTS.,But now the thought that haunts me day by day
260,CONTENTS.,"Is that the things I love, the tender way"
261,CONTENTS.,"Of mastery, the kisses that are dear"
262,CONTENTS.,"As Heaven's best gifts, to other lips and arms"
263,CONTENTS.,Owe half their blessedness and all their charms.
264,CONTENTS.,
265,CONTENTS.,"Tell me that I am wrong, O! Man of men,"
266,CONTENTS.,"Surely it is not hard to comfort me,"
267,CONTENTS.,"Laugh at my fears with dear persistency,"
268,CONTENTS.,"Nay, if thou must, lie to me! There, again,"
269,CONTENTS.,"I hear the rain, and the wind's wailing cry"
270,CONTENTS.,Stirs with wild life the night's monotony.
271,CONTENTS.,
272,CONTENTS.,
273,CONTENTS.,
274,CONTENTS.,
275,CONTENTS.,Song.
276,CONTENTS.,
277,CONTENTS.,If I had known
278,CONTENTS.,That when the morrow dawned the roses would be dead
279,CONTENTS.,I would have filled my hands with blossoms white and red.
280,CONTENTS.,If I had known!
281,CONTENTS.,
282,CONTENTS.,If I had known
283,CONTENTS.,That I should be to-day deaf to all happy birds
284,CONTENTS.,I would have lain for hours to listen to your words.
285,CONTENTS.,If I had known!
286,CONTENTS.,
287,CONTENTS.,If I had known
288,CONTENTS.,That with the morning light you would be gone for aye
289,CONTENTS.,I would have been more kind;--sweet Love had won his way
290,CONTENTS.,If I had known.
291,CONTENTS.,
292,CONTENTS.,
293,CONTENTS.,
294,CONTENTS.,
295,CONTENTS.,Anticipation.
296,CONTENTS.,
297,CONTENTS.,Let us peer forward through the dusk of years
298,CONTENTS.,And force the silent future to reveal
299,CONTENTS.,Her store of garnered joys; we may not kneel
300,CONTENTS.,"For ever, and entreat our bliss with tears."
301,CONTENTS.,"Somewhere on this drear earth the sunshine lies,"
302,CONTENTS.,Somewhere the air breathes Heaven-blown harmonies.
303,CONTENTS.,
304,CONTENTS.,Some day when you and I have fully learned
305,CONTENTS.,"Our waiting-lesson, wondering, hand in hand"
306,CONTENTS.,"We shall gaze out upon an unknown land,"
307,CONTENTS.,Our thoughts and our desires forever turned
308,CONTENTS.,"From our old griefs, as swallows, home warding,"
309,CONTENTS.,Sweep ever southward with unwearied wing.
310,CONTENTS.,
311,CONTENTS.,"We shall fare forth, comrades for evermore."
312,CONTENTS.,Though the ill-omened bird Time loves to bear
313,CONTENTS.,Has brushed this cheek and left an impress there
314,CONTENTS.,"I shall be fierce and dauntless as of yore,"
315,CONTENTS.,"Free as a bird o'er the wide world to rove,"
316,CONTENTS.,"And strong and fearless, O my Love, to love."
317,CONTENTS.,
318,CONTENTS.,"What have we now? The haunting, vague unrest"
319,CONTENTS.,Of incompleted measures; and we dream
320,CONTENTS.,"Vainly, of the Musician and His theme,"
321,CONTENTS.,How the great Master in a day most blest
322,CONTENTS.,"Shall strike some mighty chords in harmony,"
323,CONTENTS.,"And make an end, and set the music free!"
324,CONTENTS.,
325,CONTENTS.,"We snatch from Fate our moments of delight,"
326,CONTENTS.,"Few as, in April hours, the wooing calls"
327,CONTENTS.,"Of orioles, or when the twilight falls"
328,CONTENTS.,First o'er the forest ere the approach of night
329,CONTENTS.,The eyes of evening;--and Love's song is sung
330,CONTENTS.,"But once, Dear Heart, but once, and we are young."
331,CONTENTS.,
332,CONTENTS.,"Over the seas together, you and I,"
333,CONTENTS.,"'Neath blue Italian skies, or on the hills"
334,CONTENTS.,"Of storied Greece,--where the warm sunlight fills"
335,CONTENTS.,"Spain's mellow vineyards,--wandering reverently"
336,CONTENTS.,"O'er the green plains of Palestine,--our days"
337,CONTENTS.,A golden holiday in Old World ways.
338,CONTENTS.,
339,CONTENTS.,Yet would we linger not by southern shores;
340,CONTENTS.,The bracing breath of Scandinavian snows
341,CONTENTS.,Would draw us from our dreams. The North wind blows
342,CONTENTS.,"Upon thy cheek, my Norseman, and the roars"
343,CONTENTS.,Of the wild Baltic sound within my ears
344,CONTENTS.,When to my dreams thy stalwart form appears.
345,CONTENTS.,
346,CONTENTS.,This will the future bring. See! Thou hast given
347,CONTENTS.,From out the fulness of thy strength and will
348,CONTENTS.,This courage to me. Though the rugged hill
349,CONTENTS.,"Looms high, and fronts our vision, yet our heaven"
350,CONTENTS.,(I see it when I sleep) with portals wide
351,CONTENTS.,"And shining towers, gleams on the farther side."
352,CONTENTS.,
353,CONTENTS.,
354,CONTENTS.,
355,CONTENTS.,
356,CONTENTS.,Song.
357,CONTENTS.,
358,CONTENTS.,"""Tshirr!"" scolds the oriole"
359,CONTENTS.,"Where the elms stir,"
360,CONTENTS.,Flaunting her gourd-like nest
361,CONTENTS.,On the tree's swaying crest:
362,CONTENTS.,"""May's here, I cannot rest,"
363,CONTENTS.,"Go away; tshirr!"""
364,CONTENTS.,
365,CONTENTS.,"""Tshirr!"" scolds the oriole"
366,CONTENTS.,"Where the leaves blur,"
367,CONTENTS.,"Giving her threads a jerk,"
368,CONTENTS.,"Spying where rivals lurk,"
369,CONTENTS.,"""May's here, and I'm at work."
370,CONTENTS.,"Go away, tshirr!"""
371,CONTENTS.,
372,CONTENTS.,
373,CONTENTS.,
374,CONTENTS.,
375,CONTENTS.,Misunderstanding.
376,CONTENTS.,
377,CONTENTS.,Spring's face is wreathed in smiles. She had been driven
378,CONTENTS.,Hither and thither at the surly will
379,CONTENTS.,Of treacherous winds till her sweet heart was chill.
380,CONTENTS.,Into her grasp the sceptre has been given
381,CONTENTS.,And now she touches with a proud young hand
382,CONTENTS.,"The earth, and turns to blossoms all the land."
383,CONTENTS.,
384,CONTENTS.,"We catch the smile, the joyousness, the pride,"
385,CONTENTS.,And share them with her. Surely winter gloom
386,CONTENTS.,"Is for the old, and frost is for the tomb."
387,CONTENTS.,"Youth must have pleasure, and the tremulous tide"
388,CONTENTS.,"Of sun-kissed waves, and all the golden fire"
389,CONTENTS.,Of Summer's noontide splendor of desire.
390,CONTENTS.,
391,CONTENTS.,"I have forgotten,--for the breath of buds"
392,CONTENTS.,"Is on my temples, if in former days"
393,CONTENTS.,"I have known sorrow; I remember praise,"
394,CONTENTS.,"And calm content, and joy's great ocean-floods,"
395,CONTENTS.,"And many dreams so sweet that, in their place,"
396,CONTENTS.,We would not welcome even Truth's fair face.
397,CONTENTS.,
398,CONTENTS.,"O Man to whom my heart hast leaned, dost know"
399,CONTENTS.,Aught of my life? Sometimes a strong despair
400,CONTENTS.,Enters my soul and finds a lodging there;
401,CONTENTS.,"Thou dost not know me, and the years will go"
402,CONTENTS.,"As these last months have gone, and I shall be"
403,CONTENTS.,"Still far, still a strange woman unto thee."
404,CONTENTS.,
405,CONTENTS.,I do not blame thee. If there is a fault
406,CONTENTS.,"Let it be mine, for surely had I tried"
407,CONTENTS.,The door of my heart's home to open wide
408,CONTENTS.,No need had been for even Love's assault.
409,CONTENTS.,"And yet, methinks, somewhere there is a key"
410,CONTENTS.,"Thou mightest have found, and entered happily."
411,CONTENTS.,
412,CONTENTS.,I am no saint niched in a hallowed wall
413,CONTENTS.,"For men to worship, but I would compel"
414,CONTENTS.,A level gaze. You teachers who would tell
415,CONTENTS.,A woman's place I do defy you all!
416,CONTENTS.,"While justice lives, and love with joy is crowned"
417,CONTENTS.,Woman and man must meet on equal ground.
418,CONTENTS.,
419,CONTENTS.,The deepest wrong is falsehood. She who sells
420,CONTENTS.,Her soul and body for a little gain
421,CONTENTS.,"In ease, or the world's notice, has a stain"
422,CONTENTS.,Upon her soul no lighter for the bells
423,CONTENTS.,"Of marriage rites, and purer far is she"
424,CONTENTS.,Who gives her all for love's sad ecstasy.
425,CONTENTS.,
426,CONTENTS.,Canst thou not understand a nature strong
427,CONTENTS.,"And passionate, with impulses that sway,"
428,CONTENTS.,"With yearning tenderness that must have way,"
429,CONTENTS.,"Yet knows no ill desire, no touch of wrong?"
430,CONTENTS.,If thou canst not then in God's name I pray
431,CONTENTS.,See me no more forever from this day.
432,CONTENTS.,
433,CONTENTS.,
434,CONTENTS.,
435,CONTENTS.,
436,CONTENTS.,Shadow Song.
437,CONTENTS.,
438,CONTENTS.,The night is long
439,CONTENTS.,"And there are no stars,--"
440,CONTENTS.,Let me but dream
441,CONTENTS.,That the long fields gleam
442,CONTENTS.,"With sunlight and song,"
443,CONTENTS.,Then I shall not long
444,CONTENTS.,For the light of stars.
445,CONTENTS.,
446,CONTENTS.,"Let me but dream,--"
447,CONTENTS.,"For there are no stars,--"
448,CONTENTS.,Dream that the ache
449,CONTENTS.,And the wild heart-break
450,CONTENTS.,Are but things that seem.
451,CONTENTS.,Ah! let me dream
452,CONTENTS.,For there are no stars.
453,CONTENTS.,
454,CONTENTS.,
455,CONTENTS.,
456,CONTENTS.,
457,CONTENTS.,Revulsion.
458,CONTENTS.,
459,CONTENTS.,"I see the starting buds, I catch the gleam"
460,CONTENTS.,"In the near distance of a sun-kissed pool,"
461,CONTENTS.,"The blessed April air blows soft and cool,"
462,CONTENTS.,"Small wonder if all sorrow grows a dream,"
463,CONTENTS.,And we forget that close around us lie
464,CONTENTS.,"A city's poor, a city's misery."
465,CONTENTS.,
466,CONTENTS.,Of every outward vision there is some
467,CONTENTS.,Internal counterpart. To-day I know
468,CONTENTS.,"The blessedness of living, and the glow"

978,CONTENTS.,As any hill-girt lake; the long brown beach
979,CONTENTS.,Lies bare and wet. As far as eye can reach
980,CONTENTS.,There is no motion. Even on the hill
981,CONTENTS.,Where the breeze loves to wander I can see
982,CONTENTS.,"No stir of leaves, nor any waving tree."
983,CONTENTS.,
984,CONTENTS.,There is a great red cliff that fronts my view
985,CONTENTS.,"A bare, unsightly thing; it angers me"
986,CONTENTS.,With its unswerving-grim monotony.
987,CONTENTS.,"The mackerel weir, with branching boughs askew"
988,CONTENTS.,"Stands like a fire-swept forest, while the sea"
989,CONTENTS.,"Laps it, with soothing sighs, continually."
990,CONTENTS.,
991,CONTENTS.,"There are no tempests in this sheltered bay,"
992,CONTENTS.,"The stillness frets me, and I long to be"
993,CONTENTS.,"Where winds sweep strong and blow tempestuously,"
994,CONTENTS.,To stand upon some hill-top far away
995,CONTENTS.,"And face a gathering gale, and let the stress"
996,CONTENTS.,Of Nature's mood subdue my restlessness.
997,CONTENTS.,
998,CONTENTS.,"An impulse seizes me, a mad desire"
999,CONTENTS.,"To tear away that red-browed cliff, to sweep"
1000,CONTENTS.,Its crest of trees and huts into the deep;
1001,CONTENTS.,"To force a gap by axe, or storm, or fire,"
1002,CONTENTS.,And let rush in with motion glad and free
1003,CONTENTS.,The rolling waves of the wild wondrous sea.
1004,CONTENTS.,
1005,CONTENTS.,Sometimes I wonder if I am the child
1006,CONTENTS.,"Of calm, law-loving parents, or a stray"
1007,CONTENTS.,From some wild gypsy camp. I cannot stay
1008,CONTENTS.,Quiet among my fellows; when this wild
1009,CONTENTS.,Longing for freedom takes me I must fly
1010,CONTENTS.,To my dear woods and know my liberty.
1011,CONTENTS.,
1012,CONTENTS.,It is this cringing to a social law
1013,CONTENTS.,"That I despise, these changing, senseless forms"
1014,CONTENTS.,Of fashion! And until a thousand storms
1015,CONTENTS.,Of God's impatience shall reveal the flaw
1016,CONTENTS.,"In man's pet system, he will weave the spell"
1017,CONTENTS.,About his heart and dream that all is well.
1018,CONTENTS.,
1019,CONTENTS.,"Ah! Life is hard, Dear Heart, for I am left"
1020,CONTENTS.,To battle with my old-time fears alone
1021,CONTENTS.,"I must live calmly on, and make no moan"
1022,CONTENTS.,Though of my hoped-for happiness bereft.
1023,CONTENTS.,"Thou wilt not come, and still the red cliff lies"

1030,CONTENTS.,
1031,CONTENTS.,"It sings to me, it sings to me,"
1032,CONTENTS.,The shore-blown voice of the blithesome sea!
1033,CONTENTS.,"Of its world of gladness all untold,"
1034,CONTENTS.,"Of its heart of green, and its mines of gold,"
1035,CONTENTS.,And desires that leap and flee.
1036,CONTENTS.,
1037,CONTENTS.,"It moans to me, it moans to me!"
1038,CONTENTS.,The storm-stirred voice of the restive sea!
1039,CONTENTS.,Of the vain dismay and the yearning pain
1040,CONTENTS.,For hopes that will never be born again
1041,CONTENTS.,From the womb of the wavering sea.
1042,CONTENTS.,
1043,CONTENTS.,"It calls to me, it calls to me,"
1044,CONTENTS.,The luring voice of the rebel sea!
1045,CONTENTS.,And I long with a love that is born of tears
1046,CONTENTS.,"For the wild fresh life, and the glorying fears,"
1047,CONTENTS.,For the quest and the mystery.
1048,CONTENTS.,
1049,CONTENTS.,"It wails to me, it wails to me,"
1050,CONTENTS.,Of the deep dark graves in the yawning sea;
1051,CONTENTS.,And I hear the voice of a boy that is gone.
1052,CONTENTS.,But the lad sleeps sound till the judgment-dawn
1053,CONTENTS.,In the heart of the wind-swept sea.

1060,CONTENTS.,"Since first I met thee, Dear, and long before"
1061,CONTENTS.,"I knew myself beloved, save by the sense"
1062,CONTENTS.,"All women have, a shadowy confidence"
1063,CONTENTS.,"Half-fear, that _feels_ its bliss nor asks for more,"
1064,CONTENTS.,"I have learned new desires, known Love's distress"
1065,CONTENTS.,Sounded the deepest depths of loneliness.
1066,CONTENTS.,
1067,CONTENTS.,"I was a child at heart, and lived alone,"
1068,CONTENTS.,"Dreaming my dreams, as children may, at whiles,"
1069,CONTENTS.,"Between their hours of play, and Earth's broad smiles"
1070,CONTENTS.,"Allured my heart, and ocean's marvellous tone"
1071,CONTENTS.,"Woke no strange echoes, and the woods' complain"
1072,CONTENTS.,"Made chants sonorous, stirred no thoughts of pain."
1073,CONTENTS.,
1074,CONTENTS.,"And if, sometimes, dear Nature spoke to me"
1075,CONTENTS.,"In tones mysterious, I had learned so much"
1076,CONTENTS.,"Dwelling beside her daily, that her touch"
1077,CONTENTS.,Made me discerning. Though I might not see
1078,CONTENTS.,"Her purpose nor her meaning, I had part"
1079,CONTENTS.,In the proud throbbing of that mighty heart.
1080,CONTENTS.,
1081,CONTENTS.,But now the earth has put a tiring-cloth
1082,CONTENTS.,About her face; even in the mountains' cheer
1083,CONTENTS.,"There is a lack, and in the sea a fear,"
1084,CONTENTS.,"The glad, rash sea, whose every mood, if wroth"
1085,CONTENTS.,"Or soothing mild, is dear to me as are"
1086,CONTENTS.,Joy's new-born kisses on the lips of Care.
1087,CONTENTS.,
1088,CONTENTS.,"Since I have known thee, Dear, all life has grown"
1089,CONTENTS.,An expectation. As the swelling grain
1090,CONTENTS.,"Trembles to harvesting, and earth in pain"
1091,CONTENTS.,"Travails till Spring is born, so felt alone"
1092,CONTENTS.,"Is the dumb reaching out of things unborn,"
1093,CONTENTS.,The night's gray promise of the amber morn.
1094,CONTENTS.,
1095,CONTENTS.,"I long to taste my pleasures through thy lips,"
1096,CONTENTS.,To sail with thee o'er foaming waves and feel
1097,CONTENTS.,Our spirits rise together with the reel
1098,CONTENTS.,Of waters and the wavering land's eclipse;
1099,CONTENTS.,To see thy fair hair damp with salt sea-spray
1100,CONTENTS.,And in thine eyes the wildness of the way.
1101,CONTENTS.,
1102,CONTENTS.,"I long to share my woods with thee, to fly"
1103,CONTENTS.,To some black-hearted forest where the trail
1104,CONTENTS.,"Of mortals lingers not,--to hear the gale."
1105,CONTENTS.,"Sweep round us with a shuddering ecstasy,"
1106,CONTENTS.,"To feel, night's tumult passed, the cool soft hand"
1107,CONTENTS.,Of the untroubled dawn move o'er the land.
1108,CONTENTS.,
1109,CONTENTS.,"To swim with thee far out into the bay,"
1110,CONTENTS.,"A trembling glitter on the waves, the shore"
1111,CONTENTS.,"Glowing with noontide fervor, nevermore"
1112,CONTENTS.,"To fear the treacherous depths, though long the way."
1113,CONTENTS.,"Sweet beyond words the sighs that breathe and blow,"
1114,CONTENTS.,"The moist salt kisses, and the glad warm glow."
1115,CONTENTS.,
1116,CONTENTS.,"And when the unrest, the vague desires that rush"
1117,CONTENTS.,"Over our lives and may not be denied,--"
1118,CONTENTS.,"Gone in the tasting,--lure us where the tide"
1119,CONTENTS.,"Of men sweeps on, let us forget the hush"
1120,CONTENTS.,"Together, and in city madness drain"
1121,CONTENTS.,Our cup of pleasure to its dregs of pain.
1122,CONTENTS.,
1123,CONTENTS.,Ever I need thee. Incomplete and poor
1124,CONTENTS.,This life of mine. Yet never dream my soul
1125,CONTENTS.,Craves the old peace. Till I may have the whole
1126,CONTENTS.,"My joy is my abiding, and what more"
1127,CONTENTS.,Of dreams and waking bliss the Fates allow
1128,CONTENTS.,Comes as a gift of Love's great overflow.

1149,CONTENTS.,
1150,CONTENTS.,I have been pondering what our teachers call
1151,CONTENTS.,The mystery of Pain; and lo! my thought
1152,CONTENTS.,After it's half-blind reaching out has caught
1153,CONTENTS.,This truth and held it fast. We may not fall
1154,CONTENTS.,"Beyond our mounting; stung by life's annoy,"
1155,CONTENTS.,Deeper we feel the mystery of Joy.
1156,CONTENTS.,
1157,CONTENTS.,Sometimes they steal across us like a breath
1158,CONTENTS.,"Of Eastern perfume in a darkened room,"
1159,CONTENTS.,These joys of ours; we grope on through the gloom
1160,CONTENTS.,"Seeking some common thing, and from its sheath"
1161,CONTENTS.,"Unloose, unknowing, some bewildering scent"
1162,CONTENTS.,Of spice-thronged memories of the Orient.
1163,CONTENTS.,
1164,CONTENTS.,Sometimes they dart across our turbid sky
1165,CONTENTS.,Like a quick flash after a heated day.
1166,CONTENTS.,"A moment, where the sombrous shadows lay"
1167,CONTENTS.,We see a glory. Though it passed us by
1168,CONTENTS.,No earthly power can filch that dazzling glow
1169,CONTENTS.,"From memory's eye, that instant's shine and show."
1170,CONTENTS.,
1171,CONTENTS.,"Life is so full of joys. The alluring sea,"
1172,CONTENTS.,"This morning clear and placid, may, ere night,"
1173,CONTENTS.,"Toss like a petulant child, and when the light"
1174,CONTENTS.,Of a new morning dawns sweep grand and free
1175,CONTENTS.,"A mighty power. If fierce, or mild, or bright,"
1176,CONTENTS.,With every tide flows in a fresh delight.
1177,CONTENTS.,
1178,CONTENTS.,I can remember well when first I knew
1179,CONTENTS.,The fragrance of white clover. There I lay
1180,CONTENTS.,On the warm July grass and heard the play
1181,CONTENTS.,"Of sun-browned insects, and the breezes blew"
1182,CONTENTS.,To my drowsed sense the scent the blossoms had;
1183,CONTENTS.,"The subtle sweetness stayed, and I was glad."
1184,CONTENTS.,
1185,CONTENTS.,Nor passed the gladness. Though the years have gone
1186,CONTENTS.,"(A many years, Beloved, since that day,)"
1187,CONTENTS.,Whenever by the roadside or away
1188,CONTENTS.,"In radiant summer fields, wandering alone"
1189,CONTENTS.,"Or with glad children, to my restless sight"
1190,CONTENTS.,"Shows that pale head, comes back the old delight."
1191,CONTENTS.,
1192,CONTENTS.,"Oh! the dark water, and the filling sail!"
1193,CONTENTS.,"The scudding like a sea-mew, with the hand"
1194,CONTENTS.,"Firm on the tiller! See, the red-shored land"
1195,CONTENTS.,"Receding, as we brave the hastening gale!"
1196,CONTENTS.,"White gleam the wave-tops, and the breakers' roar"
1197,CONTENTS.,Sounds thunderingly on the far distant shore.
1198,CONTENTS.,
1199,CONTENTS.,This mad hair flying in the breeze blows wild
1200,CONTENTS.,"Across my face. See, there, the gathering squall,"
1201,CONTENTS.,"That dark line to the eastward, watch it crawl"
1202,CONTENTS.,Stealthily towards us o'er the snow-wreaths piled
1203,CONTENTS.,Close on each other! Ah! what joy to be
1204,CONTENTS.,"Drunk with salt air, in battle with the sea!"
1205,CONTENTS.,
1206,CONTENTS.,"So many joys, and yet I have but told"
1207,CONTENTS.,"Of simple things, the joys of air and sea!"
1208,CONTENTS.,"Not all these things are worth one hour with thee,"
1209,CONTENTS.,"One moment, when thy daring arms enfold"

1232,CONTENTS.,
1233,CONTENTS.,Resting her lilac cheek
1234,CONTENTS.,"Gently, in aspect meek,"
1235,CONTENTS.,"On the gray stone,"
1236,CONTENTS.,"The morning-glory, free,"
1237,CONTENTS.,"Welcomed the yellow bee,"

1267,CONTENTS.,
1268,CONTENTS.,"A bunch of purple aster, golden-rod"
1269,CONTENTS.,"Darkened by the first frost, a drooping spray"
1270,CONTENTS.,"Of scarlet barberry, and tall and gray"
1271,CONTENTS.,"The silk-cored cotton with its bursting pod,"
1272,CONTENTS.,"Some tarnished maple-boughs, and, like a flash"
1273,CONTENTS.,"Of sudden flame, a branch of mountain ash."
1274,CONTENTS.,
1275,CONTENTS.,"She smiled, but it was not the welcoming smile"
1276,CONTENTS.,Of frank surrender. As a witching maid
1277,CONTENTS.,In gorgeous garments cunningly arrayed

1282,CONTENTS.,"Deep in the heart of earth where the springs rise,"
1283,CONTENTS.,"Down with the sweet linnæa and the moss,"

1295,CONTENTS.,
1296,CONTENTS.,"Fate, too, with chaffering voice and beckoning hand"

1345,CONTENTS.,"Comes through half-opened windows, soft and cool"
