213,I,Hallowed the parting day;
214,I,"A shroud, a shroud of awful grey"
215,I,"Wrapped every woodland brow,"

217,I,Around each wintry bough.
218,I,

222,II,And closer round me now it clung
223,II,Until I scarce could see
224,II,The stealthy pathway overhung
225,II,By silent tree and tree
226,II,Which floated in that mystery
227,II,As--poised in waveless deeps--
228,II,"Branching in worlds below the sea,"

238,III,"A yard in front, a yard behind,"
239,III,"So strait my world was grown,"

249,IV,It seemed the world around
250,IV,Beneath some infinite sea lay drowned
251,IV,With all that e'er drew breath;

274,VI,"Buried beyond all hope was I,"
275,VI,Hope had no meaning there:
276,VI,A yard above my head the sky
277,VI,Could only mock at prayer.

310,IX,Wild wings that burst thro' death's dim night
311,IX,I can but pause and hark;

343,I,"And climb from the marge of the sea,"

382,II,"Still for a moment they stand,"
383,II,"Massed on the sun's red death,"

388,II,Of muscle and flank and mane

391,II,
392,II,Once more from the furrow's end

397,II,"And the fibrous knots of clay,"

1271,THE ADMIRAL'S GHOST,With eyes that gleamed in the lanthorn light
1272,THE ADMIRAL'S GHOST,And a voice as low as the sea.
1273,THE ADMIRAL'S GHOST,
1274,THE ADMIRAL'S GHOST,You could almost hear the stars
1275,THE ADMIRAL'S GHOST,"Twinkling up in the sky,"
1276,THE ADMIRAL'S GHOST,"And the old wind woke and moaned in the spars,"
1277,THE ADMIRAL'S GHOST,"And the same old waves went by,"

1279,THE ADMIRAL'S GHOST,Singing the same old song
1280,THE ADMIRAL'S GHOST,"As ages and ages ago,"
1281,THE ADMIRAL'S GHOST,While he froze my blood in that deep-sea night
1282,THE ADMIRAL'S GHOST,With the things that he seemed to know.
1283,THE ADMIRAL'S GHOST,
1284,THE ADMIRAL'S GHOST,A bare foot pattered on deck;
1285,THE ADMIRAL'S GHOST,"Ropes creaked; then--all grew still,"

1287,THE ADMIRAL'S GHOST,"And growled, as a sea-dog will."
1288,THE ADMIRAL'S GHOST,
1289,THE ADMIRAL'S GHOST,"""Do' ee know who Nelson was?"

1304,THE ADMIRAL'S GHOST,"""He was twice as big as he seemed;"

2377,A MAY-DAY CAROL,
2378,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,THE CALL OF THE SPRING
2379,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,
2380,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,
2381,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"Come, choose your road and away, my lad,"
2382,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"Come, choose your road and away!"
2383,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,We'll out of the town by the road's bright crown
2384,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,As it dips to the dazzling day.
2385,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,It's a long white road for the weary;
2386,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,But it rolls through the heart of the May.
2387,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,
2388,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,Though many a road would merrily ring
2389,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"To the tramp of your marching feet,"
2390,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"All roads are one from the day that's done,"
2391,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"And the miles are swift and sweet,"
2392,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,And the graves of your friends are the mile-stones
2393,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,To the land where all roads meet.
2394,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,
2395,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"But the call that you hear this day, my lad,"
2396,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,Is the Spring's old bugle of mirth
2397,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,When the year's green fire in a soul's desire
2398,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,Is brought like a rose to the birth;
2399,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,And knights ride out to adventure
2400,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,As the flowers break out of the earth.
2401,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,
2402,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,Over the sweet-smelling mountain-passes
2403,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,The clouds lie brightly curled;
2404,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,The wild-flowers cling to the crags and swing
2405,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,With cataract-dews impearled;
2406,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"And the way, the way that you choose this day"
2407,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,Is the way to the end of the world.
2408,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,
2409,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,It rolls from the golden long ago
2410,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,To the land that we ne'er shall find;
2411,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"And it's uphill here, but it's downhill there,"
2412,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"For the road is wise and kind,"
2413,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,And all rough places and cheerless faces
2414,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,Will soon be left behind.
2415,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,
2416,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"Come, choose your road and away, away,"
2417,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"We'll follow the gipsy sun,"
2418,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"For it's soon, too soon to the end of the day,"
2419,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,And the day is well begun;
2420,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"And the road rolls on through the heart of the May,"
2421,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,And there's never a May but one.
2422,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,
2423,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"There's a fir-wood here, and a dog-rose there,"
2424,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,And a note of the mating dove;
2425,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"And a glimpse, maybe, of the warm blue sea,"
2426,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,And the warm white clouds above;
2427,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,And warm to your breast in a tenderer nest
2428,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,Your sweetheart's little glove.
2429,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,
2430,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"There's not much better to win, my lad,"
2431,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,There's not much better to win!
2432,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"You have lived, you have loved, you have fought, you have proved"
2433,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,The worth of folly and sin;
2434,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"So now come out of the City's rout,"
2435,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,Come out of the dust and the din.
2436,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,
2437,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"Come out,--a bundle and stick is all"
2438,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"You'll need to carry along,"
2439,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"If your heart can carry a kindly word,"
2440,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,And your lips can carry a song;
2441,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"You may leave the lave to the keep o' the grave,"
2442,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,If your lips can carry a song!
2443,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,
2444,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"_Come, choose your road and away, my lad,"
2445,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"Come, choose your road and away!"
2446,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"We'll out of the town by the road's bright crown,"
2447,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,As it dips to the sapphire day!
2448,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"All roads may meet at the world's end,"
2449,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"But, hey for the heart of the May!"
2450,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,"Come, choose your road and away, dear lad,"
2451,THE CALL OF THE SPRING,Come choose your road and away._

2460,I,
2461,I,In a leafy lane of Devon
2462,I,"There's a cottage that I know,"
2463,I,"Then a garden--then, a grey old crumbling wall,"
2464,I,And the wall's the wall of heaven
2465,I,(Where I hardly care to go)
2466,I,And there isn't any fiery sword at all.
2467,I,
2468,I,
2469,II,II
2470,II,
2471,II,But I never went to heaven.
2472,II,"There was right good reason why,"
2473,II,"For they sent a shining angel to me there,"
2474,II,"An angel, down in Devon,"
2475,II,(Clad in muslin by the bye)
2476,II,With the halo of the sunshine on her hair.

2480,III,
2481,III,"Ah, whate'er the darkness covers,"
2482,III,"And whate'er we sing or say,"
2483,III,Would you climb the wall of heaven an hour too soon
2484,III,If you knew a place for lovers
2485,III,Where the apple-blossoms stray
2486,III,Out of heaven to sway and whisper to the moon?
2487,III,
2488,III,
2489,IV,IV
2490,IV,
2491,IV,When we die--we'll think of Devon
2492,IV,Where the garden's all aglow
2493,IV,With the flowers that stray across the grey old wall:
2494,IV,"Then we'll climb it, out of heaven,"
2495,IV,"From the other side, you know,"
2496,IV,Straggle over it from heaven
2497,IV,"With the apple-blossom snow,"
2498,IV,Tumble back again to Devon
2499,IV,"Laugh and love as long ago,"
2500,IV,Where there isn't any fiery sword at all.

2506,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2507,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2508,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Half a hundred terrible pig-tails, pirates famous in song and story,"
2509,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Hoisting the old black flag once more, in a palmy harbour of Caribbee,"
2510,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"""Farewell"" we waved to our brown-skinned lasses, and chorussing out to"
2511,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"the billows of glory,"
2512,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Billows a-glitter with rum and gold, we followed the sunset over the sea."
2513,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2514,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"_While earth goes round, let rum go round,"
2515,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Our capstan song we sung:
2516,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Half a hundred broad-sheet pirates
2517,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,When the world was young!_
2518,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2519,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Sea-roads plated with pieces of eight that rolled to a heaven by rum
2520,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"made mellow,"
2521,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Heaved and coloured our barque's black nose where the Lascar sang
2522,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"to a twinkling star,"
2523,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,And the tangled bow-sprit plunged and dipped its point in the west's
2524,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"wild red and yellow,"
2525,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Till the curved white moon crept out astern like a naked knife
2526,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,from a blue cymar.
2527,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2528,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"_While earth goes round, let rum go round,"
2529,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Our capstan song we sung:

2531,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,When the world was young!_
2532,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2533,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Half a hundred tarry pig-tails, Teach, the chewer of glass, had taught us,"
2534,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Taught us to balance the plank ye walk, your little plank-bridge"
2535,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,to Kingdom Come:
2536,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Half a score had sailed with Flint, and a dozen or so the devil"
2537,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,had brought us
2538,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Back from the pit where Blackbeard lay, in Beelzebub's bosom,"
2539,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,a-screech for rum.
2540,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2541,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"_While earth goes round, let rum go round,"
2542,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Our capstan song we sung:
2543,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Half a hundred piping pirates
2544,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,When the world was young!_
2545,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2546,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,There was Captain Hook (of whom ye have heard--so called from his terrible
2547,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"cold steel twister,"
2548,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,His own right hand having gone to a shark with a taste for skippers
2549,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"on pirate-trips),"
2550,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"There was Silver himself, with his cruel crutch, and the blind man Pew,"
2551,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"with a phiz like a blister,"
2552,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Gouged and white and dreadfully dried in the reek of a thousand
2553,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,burning ships.
2554,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2555,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"_While earth goes round, let rum go round,"
2556,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Our capstan song we sung:
2557,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Half a hundred cut-throat pirates
2558,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,When the world was young!_
2559,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2560,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,With our silver buckles and French cocked hats and our skirted coats
2561,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"(they were growing greener,"
2562,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,But green and gold look well when spliced! We'd trimmed 'em up
2563,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,wi' some fine fresh lace)
2564,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Bravely over the seas we danced to the horn-pipe tune of a concertina,"
2565,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Cutlasses jetting beneath our skirts and cambric handkerchiefs
2566,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,all in place.
2567,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2568,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"_While earth goes round, let rum go round,"
2569,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Our capstan song we sung:
2570,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Half a hundred elegant pirates
2571,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,When the world was young!_
2572,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2573,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"And our black prow grated, one golden noon, on the happiest isle of"
2574,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"the Happy Islands,"
2575,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"An isle of Paradise, fair as a gem, on the sparkling breast of the"
2576,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"wine-dark deep,"
2577,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"An isle of blossom and yellow sand, and enchanted vines on the purple"
2578,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"highlands,"
2579,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Wi' grapes like melons, nay clustering suns, a-sprawl over cliffs in"
2580,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,their noonday sleep.
2581,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2582,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"_While earth goes round let rum go round,"
2583,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Our capstan song we sung:
2584,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Half a hundred dream-struck pirates
2585,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,When the world was young!_
2586,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2587,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"And lo! on the soft warm edge of the sand, where the sea like wine"
2588,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,in a golden noggin
2589,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Creamed, and the rainbow-bubbles clung to his flame-red hair,"
2590,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"a white youth lay,"
2591,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Sleeping; and now, as his drowsy grip relaxed, the cup that he"
2592,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,squeezed his grog in
2593,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Slipped from his hand and its purple dregs were mixed with the flames
2594,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,and flakes of spray.
2595,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2596,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"_While earth goes round, let rum go round,"
2597,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Our capstan song we sung:
2598,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Half a hundred diffident pirates
2599,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,When the world was young!_
2600,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2601,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,And we suddenly saw (had we seen them before? They were coloured like
2602,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,sand or the pelt on his shoulders)
2603,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"His head was pillowed on two great leopards, whose breathing rose"
2604,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,and sank with his own;
2605,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Now a pirate is bold, but the vision was rum and would _call_ for rum"
2606,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"in the best of beholders,"
2607,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"And it seemed we had seen Him before, in a dream, with that flame-red"
2608,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,hair and that vine-leaf crown.
2609,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2610,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"_And the earth went round, and the rum went round,"
2611,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,And softlier now we sung:
2612,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Half a hundred awe-struck pirates
2613,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,When the world was young!_
2614,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2615,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Now Timothy Hook (of whom ye have heard, with his talon of steel)"
2616,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"our doughty skipper,"
2617,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"A man that, in youth being brought up pious, had many a book on"
2618,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"his cabin-shelf,"
2619,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Suddenly caught at a comrade's hand with the tearing claws of his
2620,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,cold steel flipper
2621,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"And cried, ""Great Thunder and Brimstone, boys, I've hit it at last!"
2622,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"_'Tis Bacchus himself._"""
2623,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2624,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"_And the earth went round, and the rum went round,"
2625,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,And never a word we sung:
2626,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Half a hundred tottering pirates
2627,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,When the world was young!_
2628,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2629,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,He flung his French cocked hat i' the foam (though its lace was the best
2630,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,of his wearing apparel):
2631,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,We stared at him--Bacchus! The sea reeled round like a wine-vat
2632,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"splashing with purple dreams,"
2633,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,And the sunset-skies were dashed with blood of the grape as the sun
2634,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,like a new-staved barrel
2635,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Flooded the tumbling West with wine and spattered the clouds with
2636,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,crimson gleams.
2637,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2638,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"_And the earth went round, and our heads went round,"
2639,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,And never a word we sung:
2640,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Half a hundred staggering pirates
2641,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,When the world was young!_
2642,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2643,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Down to the ship for a fishing-net our crafty Hook sent Silver leaping;
2644,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Back he came on his pounding crutch, for all the world like a kangaroo;"
2645,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,And we caught the net and up to the Sleeper on hands and knees we all
2646,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"went creeping,"
2647,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Flung it across him and staked it down! 'Twas the best of our dreams
2648,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,and the dream was true.
2649,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2650,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"_And the earth went round, and the rum went round,"
2651,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,And loudly now we sung:
2652,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Half a hundred jubilant pirates
2653,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,When the world was young!_
2654,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2655,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"We had caught our god, and we got him aboard ere he woke (he was more"
2656,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,than a little heavy);
2657,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Glittering, beautiful, flushed he lay in the lurching bows of"
2658,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"the old black barque,"
2659,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"As the sunset died and the white moon dawned, and we saw on the island"
2660,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,a star-bright bevy
2661,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Of naked Bacchanals stealing to watch through the whispering vines in
2662,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,the purple dark!
2663,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2664,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"_While earth goes round, let rum go round,"
2665,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Our capstan song we sung:
2666,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Half a hundred innocent pirates
2667,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,When the world was young!_
2668,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2669,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Beautiful under the sailing moon, in the tangled net, with the leopards"
2670,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"beside him,"
2671,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Snared like a wild young red-lipped merman, wilful, petulant,"
2672,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,flushed he lay;
2673,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,While Silver and Hook in their big sea-boots and their boat-cloaks
2674,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"guarded and gleefully eyed him,"
2675,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Thinking what Bacchus might do for a seaman, like standing him drinks,"
2676,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,as a man might say.
2677,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2678,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"_While earth goes round, let rum go round,"
2679,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,We sailed away and sung:
2680,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Half a hundred fanciful pirates
2681,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,When the world was young!_
2682,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2683,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"All the grog that ever was heard of, gods, was it stowed in our"
2684,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,sure possession?
2685,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"O, the pictures that broached the skies and poured their colours"
2686,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,across our dreams!
2687,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"O, the thoughts that tapped the sunset, and rolled like a great"
2688,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,torchlight procession
2689,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Down our throats in a glory of glories, a roaring splendour"
2690,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,of golden streams!
2691,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2692,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"_And the earth went round, and the stars went round,"
2693,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,As we hauled the sheets and sung:
2694,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Half a hundred infinite pirates
2695,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,When the world was young!_
2696,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2697,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Beautiful, white, at the break of day, He woke and, the net in a"
2698,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"smoke dissolving,"
2699,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"He rose like a flame, with his yellow-eyed pards and his"
2700,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"flame-red hair like a windy dawn,"
2701,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"And the crew kept back, respectful like, till the leopards advanced"
2702,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"with their eyes revolving,"
2703,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Then up the rigging went Silver and Hook, and the rest of us followed"
2704,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,with case-knives drawn.
2705,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2706,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"_While earth goes round, let rum go round,"
2707,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Our cross-tree song we sung:
2708,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Half a hundred terrified pirates
2709,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,When the world was young!_
2710,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2711,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"And ""Take me home to my happy island!"" he says. ""Not I,"" sings Hook,"
2712,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"""by thunder;"
2713,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"We'll take you home to a happier isle, our palmy harbour of Caribbee!"""
2714,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"""You won't!"" says Bacchus, and quick as a dream the planks of the deck just"
2715,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"heaved asunder,"
2716,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,And a mighty Vine came straggling up that grew from the depths of
2717,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,the wine-dark sea.
2718,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2719,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"_And the sea went round, and the skies went round,"
2720,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,As our cross-tree song we sung:
2721,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Half a hundred horrified pirates
2722,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,When the world was young!_
2723,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2724,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"We were anchored fast as an oak on land, and the branches clutched and"
2725,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"the tendrils quickened,"
2726,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"And bound us writhing like snakes to the spars! Ay, we hacked with our"
2727,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"knives at the boughs in vain,"
2728,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"And Bacchus laughed loud on the decks below, as ever the tough sprays"
2729,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"tightened and thickened,"
2730,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"And the blazing hours went by, and we gaped with thirst and our ribs"
2731,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,were racked with pain
2732,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2733,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"_And the skies went round, and the sea swam round,"
2734,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,And we knew not what we sung:
2735,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Half a hundred lunatic pirates
2736,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,When the world was young!_
2737,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2738,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Bunch upon bunch of sunlike grapes, as we writhed and struggled and raved"

2742,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Clustering grapes, O, bigger than pumpkins, just out of reach they"
2743,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,bobbed and dangled

2745,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2746,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"_And the sun went round, and the moon came round,"
2747,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,And mocked us where we hung:

2749,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,When the world was young!_
2750,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2751,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Over the waters the white moon winked its bruised old eye at our

2753,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,When suddenly we were aware of a light such as never a moon
2754,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"or a ship's lamp throws,"
2755,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"And a shallop of pearl, like a Nautilus shell, came shimmering up"
2756,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"as by magic arisen,"
2757,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,With sails: of silk and a glory around it that turned the sea
2758,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,to a rippling rose.
2759,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2760,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"_And our heads went round, and the stars went round,"
2761,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,At the song that cruiser sung:

2763,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,When the world was young!_
2764,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2765,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Half a hundred rose-white Bacchanals hauled the ropes of that rosy cruiser!
2766,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Over the seas they came and laid their little white hands on the old
2767,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,black barque;
2768,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"And Bacchus he ups and he steps aboard: ""Hi, stop!"" cries Hook,"
2769,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"""you frantic old boozer!"
2770,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Belay, below there, don't you go and leave poor pirates to"

2776,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,When the world was young!_
2777,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,

2780,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"High on the poop of rose and pearl, and kisses his hand to us,"
2781,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,pleasant as pie!
2782,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"While the Bacchanals danced to their tambourines, and the vine-leaves"
2783,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"flew, and Hook just eyed him"
2784,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Once, as a man that was brought up pious, and scornfully hollers,"
2785,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"""_Well, you ain't shy!_"""
2786,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2787,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"_For all around him, vine-leaf crowned,"
2788,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,The wild white Bacchanals flung!
2789,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Nor it wasn't a sight for respectable pirates
2790,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,When the world was young!_
2791,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2792,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"All around that rainbow-Nautilus rippled the bloom of a thousand roses,"
2793,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Nay, but the sparkle of fairy sea-nymphs breasting a fairy-like"
2794,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"sea of wine,"
2795,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Swimming around it in murmuring thousands, with white arms tossing;"
2796,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,till--all that _we_ knows is
2797,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"The light went out, and the night was dark, and the grapes had"
2798,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,burst and their juice was--brine!
2799,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2800,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,_And the vines that bound our bodies round
2801,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Were plain wet ropes that clung,"

2804,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2805,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Over the seas in the pomp of dawn a king's ship came with her proud
2806,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,flag flying.
2807,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,Cloud upon cloud we watched her tower with her belts and her crowded
2808,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,zones of sail;
2809,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"And an A.B. perched in a white crow's nest, with a brass-rimmed"
2810,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"spy-glass quietly spying,"
2811,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,As we swallowed the lumps in our choking throats and uttered
2812,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,our last faint feeble hail!
2813,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2814,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"_And our heads went round as the ship went round,"
2815,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,And we thought how coves had swung:
2816,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,All for playing at broad-sheet pirates
2817,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,When the world was young!_
2818,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2819,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Half a hundred trembling corsairs, all cut loose, but a trifle giddy,"
2820,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,We lands on their trim white decks at last and the bo'sun he whistles us
2821,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"good hot grog,"
2822,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"And we tries to confess, but there wasn't a soul from the Admiral's"
2823,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,self to the gold-laced middy
2824,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"But says, ""They're delirious still, poor chaps,"" and the Cap'n he"
2825,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"enters the fact in his log,"
2826,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2827,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,_That his boat's crew found us nearly drowned

2830,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,When the world was young!_
2831,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,
2832,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"So we sailed by Execution Dock, where the swinging pirates haughty"
2833,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,and scornful
2834,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Rattled their chains, and on Margate beach we came like a school-treat"
2835,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,safe to land;
2836,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"And one of us took to religion at once; and the rest of the crew, tho'"
2837,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"their hearts were mournful,"
2838,BACCHUS AND THE PIRATES,"Capered about as Christy Minstrels, while Hook conducted the big"

3613,III,Under the drifting skies.
3614,III,
3615,III,"Poor little face cast backward,"
3616,III,"Better to see his own,"
3617,III,Earth and heaven went past them
3618,III,"Drifting: they two, alone"
3619,III,"Stood, immortal. He whispered--"
3620,III,"""Nothing can part us two!"""
3621,III,Backward her sad little face went
3622,III,"Drifting, and dreamed it true."
3623,III,
3624,III,"""Others are happy,"" she murmured,"
3625,III,"""Maidens and men I have seen;"
3626,III,"You are my king, Sawara,"
3627,III,"O, let me be your queen!"
3628,III,"If I am all too lowly,"""
3629,III,"Sadly she strove to smile,"
3630,III,"""Let me follow your footsteps,"
3631,III,"Your slave for a little while."""
3632,III,
3633,III,"Surely, he thought, I have painted"
3634,III,Nothing so fair as this
3635,III,Moonlit almond blossom
3636,III,"Sweet to fold and kiss,"
3637,III,"Brow that is filled with music,"
3638,III,"Shell of a faery sea,"
3639,III,Eyes like the holy violets
3640,III,Brimmed with dew for me.
3641,III,
3642,III,"""Wait for Sawara,"" he whispered,"
3643,III,"""Does not his whole heart yearn"
3644,III,Now to his moon-bright maiden?
3645,III,"Wait, for he will return"
3646,III,Rich as the wave on the moon's path
3647,III,"Rushing to claim his bride!"""
3648,III,"So they plighted their promise,"
3649,III,And the ebbing sea-wave sighed.
3650,III,
3651,III,
3652,IV,IV
3653,IV,
3654,IV,"Moon and flower and butterfly,"
3655,IV,"Earth and heaven went drifting by,"
3656,IV,Three long years while Kimi dreamed
3657,IV,Under the silvery willow-tree
3658,IV,"In the school of Tenko,"
3659,IV,Steadfast while the whole world streamed
3660,IV,Past her tow'rds Eternity;
3661,IV,"Steadfast till with one great cry,"
3662,IV,"Ringing to the gods on high,"
3663,IV,Golden wings should blind the sky
3664,IV,And bring him back to Tenko.
3665,IV,
3666,IV,Three long years and nought to say
3667,IV,"""Sweet, I come the golden way,"
3668,IV,Riding royally to the school
3669,IV,Under the silvery willow-tree
3670,IV,Claim my bride of Tenko;
3671,IV,"Silver bells on a milk-white mule,"
3672,IV,"Rose-red sails on an emerald sea!"" ..."
3673,IV,Kimi sometimes went to pray
3674,IV,"In the temple nigh the bay,"
3675,IV,Dreamed all night and gazed all day
3676,IV,Over the sea from Tenko.
3677,IV,
3678,IV,Far away his growing fame
3679,IV,Lit the clouds. No message came
3680,IV,"From the sky, whereon she gazed"
3681,IV,Under the silvery willow-tree
3682,IV,Far away from Tenko!
3683,IV,Small white hands in the temple raised
3684,IV,"Pleaded with the Mystery,--"
3685,IV,"""Stick of incense in the flame,"
3686,IV,"Though my love forget my name,"
3687,IV,"Help him, bless him, all the same,"
3688,IV,"And ... bring him back to Tenko!"""
3689,IV,
3690,IV,"_Rose-white temple nigh the bay,"
3691,IV,"Hush! for Kimi comes to pray,"
3692,IV,Dream all night and gaze all day
3693,IV,Over the sea from Tenko._
3694,IV,
3695,IV,
3696,V,V
3697,V,
3698,V,"So, when the rich young merchant"
3699,V,"Showed him his bags of gold,"
3700,V,"Yoichi Tenko, the painter,"
3701,V,"Gave him her hand to hold,"
3702,V,"Said: ""You shall wed him, O Kimi."""
3703,V,Softly he lied and smiled--
3704,V,"""_Yea, for Sawara is wedded!"
3705,V,"Let him not mock you, child._"""
3706,V,
3707,V,"Dumbly she turned and left them,"
3708,V,Never a word or cry
3709,V,Broke from her lips' grey petals
3710,V,Under the drifting sky:
3711,V,"Down to the spray and the rainbows,"
3712,V,Where she had watched him of old
3713,V,"Painting the rose-red islands,"
3714,V,"Painting the sand's wet gold,"
3715,V,
3716,V,"Down to their dreams of the sunset,"
3717,V,"Frail as a flower's white ghost,"
3718,V,Lonely and lost she wandered
3719,V,Down to the darkening coast;
3720,V,"Lost in the drifting midnight,"
3721,V,"Weeping, desolate, blind."
3722,V,Many went out to seek her:
3723,V,Never a heart could find.
3724,V,
3725,V,"Yoichi Tenko, the painter,"
3726,V,Plucked from his willow-tree
3727,V,Two big paper lanterns
3728,V,And ran to the brink of the sea;
3729,V,"Over his head he held them,"
3730,V,"Crying, and only heard,"
3731,V,"Somewhere, out in the darkness,"
3732,V,The cry of a wandering bird.
3733,V,
3734,V,
3735,VI,VI
3736,VI,
3737,VI,"Peonies, peonies thronged the May"
3738,VI,When in royal-rich array
3739,VI,Came Sawara to the school
3740,VI,Under the silvery willow-tree--
3741,VI,To the school of Tenko!
3742,VI,"Silver bells on a milk-white mule,"
3743,VI,Rose-red sails on an emerald sea!
3744,VI,"Over the bloom of the cherry spray,"
3745,VI,"Peonies, peonies dimmed the day;"
3746,VI,And he rode the royal way
3747,VI,Back to Yoichi Tenko.
3748,VI,
3749,VI,"Yoichi Tenko, half afraid,"
3750,VI,"Whispered, ""Wed some other maid;"
3751,VI,Kimi left me all alone
3752,VI,"Under the silvery willow-tree,"
3753,VI,"Left me,"" whispered Tenko,"
3754,VI,"""Kimi had a heart of stone!""--"
3755,VI,"""Kimi, Kimi? Who is she?"
3756,VI,Kimi? Ah--the child that played
3757,VI,Round the willow-tree. She prayed
3758,VI,"Often; and, whate'er I said,"
3759,VI,"She believed it, Tenko."""
3760,VI,
3761,VI,He had come to paint anew
3762,VI,"Those dim isles of rose and blue,"
3763,VI,"For a palace far away,"
3764,VI,Under the silvery willow-tree--
3765,VI,So he said to Tenko;
3766,VI,"And he painted, day by day,"
3767,VI,Golden visions of the sea.
3768,VI,"No, he had not come to woo;"
3769,VI,"Yet, had Kimi proven true,"
3770,VI,"Doubtless he had loved her too,"
3771,VI,Hardly less than Tenko.
3772,VI,
3773,VI,"Since the thought was in his head,"
3774,VI,He would make his choice and wed;
3775,VI,And a lovely maid he chose
3776,VI,Under the silvery willow-tree.
3777,VI,"""Fairer far,"" said Tenko."
3778,VI,"""Kimi had a twisted nose,"
3779,VI,"And a foot too small, for me,"
3780,VI,"And her face was dull as lead!"""
3781,VI,"""Nay, a flower, be it white or red,"
3782,VI,"_Is_ a flower,"" Sawara said!"
3783,VI,"""So it is,"" said Tenko."
3784,VI,
3785,VI,
3786,VII,VII
3787,VII,
3788,VII,"Great Sawara, the painter,"
3789,VII,"Sought, on a day of days,"
3790,VII,One of the peacock islands
3791,VII,Out in the sunset haze:
3792,VII,Rose-red sails on the water
3793,VII,Carried him quickly nigh;
3794,VII,There would he paint him a wonder
3795,VII,Worthy of Hokusai.
3796,VII,
3797,VII,"Lo, as he leapt o'er the creaming"
3798,VII,"Roses of faery foam,"
3799,VII,Out of the green-lipped caverns
3800,VII,"Under the isle's blue dome,"
3801,VII,"White as a drifting snow-flake,"
3802,VII,"White as the moon's white flame,"
3803,VII,"White as a ghost from the darkness,"
3804,VII,Little O Kimi came.
3805,VII,
3806,VII,"""Long I have waited, Sawara,"
3807,VII,"Here in our sunset isle,"
3808,VII,"Sawara, Sawara, Sawara,"
3809,VII,"Look on me once, and smile;"
3810,VII,"Face I have watched so long for,"
3811,VII,"Hands I have longed to hold,"
3812,VII,"Sawara, Sawara, Sawara,"
3813,VII,"Why is your heart so cold?"""
3814,VII,
3815,VII,"Surely, he thought, I have painted"
3816,VII,Nothing so fair as this
3817,VII,Moonlit almond blossom
3818,VII,Sweet to fold and kiss....
3819,VII,"""Kimi,"" he said, ""I am wedded!"
3820,VII,"Hush, for it could not be!"""
3821,VII,"""Kiss me one kiss,"" she whispered,"
3822,VII,"""Me also, even me."""
3823,VII,
3824,VII,Small and terribly drifting
3825,VII,"Backward, her sad white face"
3826,VII,Lifted up to Sawara
3827,VII,"Once, in that lonely place,"
3828,VII,White as a drifting blossom
3829,VII,"Under his wondering eyes,"
3830,VII,Slowly he gathered and held her
3831,VII,Under the drifting skies.
3832,VII,
3833,VII,"""Others are happy,"" she whispered,"
3834,VII,"""Maidens and men I have seen:"
3835,VII,"Be happy, be happy, Sawara!"
3836,VII,The other--shall be--your queen!
3837,VII,"Kiss me one kiss for parting."""
3838,VII,"Trembling she lifted her head,"
3839,VII,Then like a broken blossom
3840,VII,It fell on his arm. She was dead.
3841,VII,
3842,VII,
3843,VIII,VIII
3844,VIII,
3845,VIII,"Much impressed, Sawara straight"
3846,VIII,(Though the hour was growing late)
3847,VIII,Made a sketch of Kimi lying
3848,VIII,"By the lonely, sighing sea,"
3849,VIII,Brought it back to Tenko.
3850,VIII,Tenko looked it over crying
3851,VIII,(Under the silvery willow-tree).
3852,VIII,"""You have burst the golden gate!"
3853,VIII,You have conquered Time and Fate!
3854,VIII,Hokusai is not so great!
3855,VIII,"This is Art,"" said Tenko!"

3859,THE ENCHANTED ISLAND,THE ENCHANTED ISLAND
3860,THE ENCHANTED ISLAND,
3861,THE ENCHANTED ISLAND,
3862,I,I
3863,I,
3864,I,I remember--
3865,I,"a breath, a breath"
3866,I,"Blown thro' the rosy gates of birth,"
3867,I,A morning freshness not of the earth
3868,I,But cool and strange and lovely as death
3869,I,"In Paradise, in Paradise,"
3870,I,"When, all to suffer the old sweet pain"
3871,I,Closing his immortal eyes
3872,I,Wonder-wild an angel lies
3873,I,With wings of rainbow-tinctured grain
3874,I,"Withering till--ah, wonder-wild,"
3875,I,Here on the dawning earth again
3876,I,"He wakes, a little child."
3877,I,
3878,I,
3879,II,II
3880,II,
3881,II,I remember--
3882,II,"a gleam, a gleam"
3883,II,Of sparkling waves and warm blue sky
3884,II,"Far away and long ago,"
3885,II,Or ever I knew that youth could die;
3886,II,"And out of the dawn, the dawn, the dawn,"
3887,II,Into the unknown life we sailed
3888,II,"As out of sleep into a dream,"
3889,II,"And, as with elfin cables drawn"
3890,II,In dusk of purple over the glowing
3891,II,"Wrinkled measureless emerald sea,"
3892,II,The light cloud shadows larger far
3893,II,"Than the sweet shapes which drew them on,"
3894,II,Elfin exquisite shadows flowing
3895,II,Between us and the morning star
3896,II,"Chased us all a summer's day,"
3897,II,And our sail like a dew-lit blossom shone
3898,II,"Till, over a rainbow haze of spray"
3899,II,That arched a reef of surf like snow
3900,II,--Far away and long ago--
3901,II,We saw the sky-line rosily engrailed
3902,II,With tufted peaks above a smooth lagoon
3903,II,"Which growing, growing, growing as we sailed"
3904,II,Curved all around them like a crescent moon;
3905,II,"And then we saw the purple-shadowed creeks,"
3906,II,"The feathery palms, the gleaming golden streaks"
3907,II,"Of sand, and nearer yet, like jewels of fire"
3908,II,"Streaming between the boughs, or floating higher"
3909,II,"Like tiny sunset-clouds in noon-day skies,"
3910,II,The birds of Paradise.
3911,II,
3912,II,
3913,III,III
3914,III,
3915,III,"The island floated in the air,"
3916,III,Its image floated in the sea:
3917,III,Which was the shadow? Both were fair:
3918,III,Like sister souls they seemed to be;
3919,III,"And one was dreaming and asleep,"
3920,III,And one bent down from Paradise
3921,III,To kiss with radiance in the deep
3922,III,The darkling lips and eyes.
3923,III,
3924,III,"And, mingling softly in their dreams,"
3925,III,That holy kiss of sea and sky
3926,III,Transfused the shadows and the gleams
3927,III,Of Time and of Eternity:
3928,III,The dusky face looked up and gave
3929,III,To heaven its golden shadowed calm;
3930,III,The face of light fulfilled the wave
3931,III,With blissful wings and fans of palm.
3932,III,
3933,III,"Above, the tufted rosy peaks"
3934,III,"That melted in the warm blue skies,"
3935,III,"Below, the purple-shadowed creeks"
3936,III,That glassed the birds of Paradise--
3937,III,"A bridal knot, it hung in heaven;"
3938,III,"And, all around, the still lagoon"
3939,III,From bloom of dawn to blush of even
3940,III,Curved like a crescent moon.
3941,III,
3942,III,And there we wandered evermore
3943,III,"Thro' boyhood's everlasting years,"
3944,III,Listening the murmur of the shore
3945,III,As one that lifts a shell and hears
3946,III,The murmur of forgotten seas
3947,III,"Around some lost Broceliande,"
3948,III,The sigh of sweet Eternities
3949,III,"That turn the world to fairy-land,"
3950,III,
3951,III,That turned our isle to a single pearl
3952,III,Glowing in measureless waves of wine!
3953,III,"Above, below, the clouds would curl,"
3954,III,"Above, below, the stars would shine"
3955,III,In sky and sea.   We hung in heaven!
3956,III,Time and space were but elfin-sweet
3957,III,Rock-bound pools for the dawn and even
3958,III,To wade with their rosy feet.
3959,III,
3960,III,Our pirate cavern faced the West:
3961,III,"We closed its door with screens of palm,"
3962,III,While some went out to seek the nest
3963,III,"Wherein the Phoenix, breathing balm,"
3964,III,Burns and dies to live for ever
3965,III,(How should we dream we lived to die?)
3966,III,And some would fish in the purple river
3967,III,That thro' the hills brought down the sky.
3968,III,
3969,III,And some would dive in the lagoon
3970,III,"Like sunbeams, and all round our isle"
3971,III,"Swim thro' the lovely crescent moon,"
3972,III,"Glimpsing, for breathless mile on mile,"
3973,III,"The wild sea-woods that bloomed below,"
3974,III,"The rainbow fish, the coral cave"
3975,III,Where vanishing swift as melting snow
3976,III,A mermaid's arm would wave.
3977,III,
3978,III,Then dashing shoreward thro' the spray
3979,III,"On sun-lit sands they cast them down,"
3980,III,Or in the white sea-daisies lay
3981,III,"With sun-stained bodies rosy-brown,"
3982,III,Content to watch the foam-bows flee
3983,III,"Across the shelving reefs and bars,"
3984,III,With wild eyes gazing out to sea
3985,III,Like happy haunted stars.
3986,III,
3987,III,
3988,IV,IV
3989,IV,
3990,IV,"And O, the wild sea-maiden"
3991,IV,"Drifting through the starlit air,"
3992,IV,With white arms blossom-laden
3993,IV,And the sea-scents in her hair:
3994,IV,Sometimes we heard her singing
3995,IV,"The midnight forest through,"
3996,IV,Or saw a soft hand flinging
3997,IV,Blossoms drenched with starry dew
3998,IV,Into the dreaming purple cave;
3999,IV,"And, sometimes, far and far away"
4000,IV,Beheld across the glooming wave
4001,IV,"Beyond the dark lagoon,"
4002,IV,"Beyond the silvery foaming bar,"
4003,IV,The black bright rock whereon she lay
4004,IV,Like a honey-coloured star
4005,IV,"Singing to the breathless moon,"
4006,IV,Singing in the silent night
4007,IV,Till the stars for sheer delight
4008,IV,"Closed their eyes, and drowsy birds"
4009,IV,In the midmost forest spray
4010,IV,"Took their heads from out their wings,"
4011,IV,Thinking--it is Ariel sings
4012,IV,And we must catch the witching words
4013,IV,And sing them o'er by day.
4014,IV,
4015,IV,
4016,V,V
4017,V,
4018,V,"And then, there came a breath, a breath"
4019,V,"Cool and strange and dark as death,"
4020,V,"A stealing shadow, not of the earth"
4021,V,But fresh and wonder-wild as birth.
4022,V,I know not when the hour began
4023,V,"That changed the child's heart in the man,"
4024,V,"Or when the colours began to wane,"
4025,V,But all our roseate island lay
4026,V,"Stricken, as when an angel dies"
4027,V,With wings of rainbow-tinctured grain
4028,V,"Withering, and his radiant eyes"
4029,V,Closing. Pitiless walls of grey
4030,V,"Gathered around us, a growing tomb"
4031,V,From which it seemed not death or doom
4032,V,Could roll the stone away.
4033,V,

4035,VI,VI
4036,VI,
4037,VI,Yet--I remember--
4038,VI,"a gleam, a gleam,"
4039,VI,(Or ever I dreamed that youth could die!)
4040,VI,Of sparkling waves and warm blue sky
4041,VI,"As out of sleep into a dream,"
4042,VI,"Wonder-wild for the old sweet pain,"
4043,VI,We sailed into that unknown sea
4044,VI,Through the gates of Eternity.
4045,VI,
4046,VI,Peacefully close your mortal eyes
4047,VI,For ye shall wake to it again

4111,THE HILL-FLOWER,To-day a golden pinion stirred
4112,THE HILL-FLOWER,"The world's Bethesda pool,"
4113,THE HILL-FLOWER,And I believed the song I heard
4114,THE HILL-FLOWER,Nor put my heart to school;
4115,THE HILL-FLOWER,And through the rainbows of the dream
4116,THE HILL-FLOWER,I saw the gates of Eden gleam.
4117,THE HILL-FLOWER,
4118,THE HILL-FLOWER,The rain had ceased.   The great hills rolled
4119,THE HILL-FLOWER,In silence to the deep:
4120,THE HILL-FLOWER,The gorse in waves of green and gold
4121,THE HILL-FLOWER,Perfumed their lonely sleep;
4122,THE HILL-FLOWER,"And, at my feet, one elfin flower"
4123,THE HILL-FLOWER,"Drooped, blind with glories of the shower."
4124,THE HILL-FLOWER,
4125,THE HILL-FLOWER,I stooped--a giant from the sky--
4126,THE HILL-FLOWER,"Above its piteous shield,"
4127,THE HILL-FLOWER,"And, suddenly, the dream went by,"
4128,THE HILL-FLOWER,And there--was heaven revealed!
4129,THE HILL-FLOWER,I stooped to pluck it; but my hand
4130,THE HILL-FLOWER,"Paused, mid-way, o'er its fairyland."
4131,THE HILL-FLOWER,
4132,THE HILL-FLOWER,"Not of mine own was that strange voice,"
4133,THE HILL-FLOWER,"""Pluck--tear a star from heaven!"""
4134,THE HILL-FLOWER,Mine only was the awful choice
4135,THE HILL-FLOWER,To scoff and be forgiven
4136,THE HILL-FLOWER,Or hear the very grass I trod
4137,THE HILL-FLOWER,Whispering the gentle thoughts of God.

4142,THE HILL-FLOWER,"Its beauty born to die,"
4143,THE HILL-FLOWER,"Touched me, I know it seemed to be"
4144,THE HILL-FLOWER,Cherished by all Eternity.
4145,THE HILL-FLOWER,
4146,THE HILL-FLOWER,"Man, doomed to crush at every stride"
4147,THE HILL-FLOWER,A hundred lives like this
4148,THE HILL-FLOWER,"Which by their weakness were allied,"
4149,THE HILL-FLOWER,"If by naught else, to his,"
4150,THE HILL-FLOWER,Can only for a flash discern
4151,THE HILL-FLOWER,What passion through the whole doth yearn.
4152,THE HILL-FLOWER,
4153,THE HILL-FLOWER,Not into words can I distil
4154,THE HILL-FLOWER,The pity or the pain
4155,THE HILL-FLOWER,Which hallowing all that lonely hill
4156,THE HILL-FLOWER,"Cried out ""Refrain, refrain,"""
4157,THE HILL-FLOWER,"Then breathed from earth and sky and sea,"
4158,THE HILL-FLOWER,"""Herein you did it unto Me."""

4160,THE HILL-FLOWER,"Somewhile that hill was heaven's own breast,"
4161,THE HILL-FLOWER,"The flower its joy and grief,"
4162,THE HILL-FLOWER,Hugged close and fostered and caressed
4163,THE HILL-FLOWER,In every brief bright leaf:
4164,THE HILL-FLOWER,"And, ere I went thro' sun and dew,"
4165,THE HILL-FLOWER,"I leant and gently touched it, too."

5359,X,Echoed his name beneath that rosy star;
5360,X,And thy farewell came faint as from the grave
5361,X,For very bliss; but we

5371,XI,Had swept. They solemnized his music well!
5372,XI,"Farewell! What word could answer but farewell,"
5373,XI,"From thee, O happy spirit, that couldst steal"

5375,XI,What voice of ours could break the silent spell
5376,XI,"Beauty had cast upon thee, or reveal"
5377,XI,The gates of sun and dew

5389,XII,"To the everlasting dawn; and, in thy palm"
5390,XII,The golden apple of the Hesperian isle

5393,XII,"Nor Dian's curved white moon,"

5404,XIII,With all the cloudy veils of Time withdrawn
5405,XIII,Or only glistening round the firm white snows
5406,XIII,Of their pure beauty like the golden dew
5407,XIII,Brushed from the feathery ferns below the lawn;
5408,XIII,"But not to cold Diana's morning rose,"

5420,XIV,Where each in each ye move like light in light?
5421,XIV,How should I judge the rapture till I know
5422,XIV,The pain?_ And like three waves of music there
5423,XIV,"They closed thee round, blinding thy blissful sight"
5424,XIV,"With beauty and, like one roseate orb a-glow,"
5425,XIV,They bore thee on their breasts

5450,XVI,"And not denied or cursed, but couldst embrace"
5451,XVI,"Infinite sweetness in the heart of pain,"

5453,XVI,Wherein like waves of one harmonious sea
5454,XVI,"All our slight dreams of heaven are singing still,"
5455,XVI,"And still the throned Olympians swell the strain,"

5470,XVII,"Grief modulates into heaven, hate drowns in love,"
5471,XVII,No strife now but of love in that great sea
5472,XVII,Of song!   I dream!   I dream!   Mine eyes grow blind:
5473,XVII,Chords that I not command
5474,XVII,Escape the fainting hand;

6273,FITZWALTER,My Marian must ride if Huntingdon
6274,FITZWALTER,Tramples the forest-laws beneath his heel
6275,FITZWALTER,"And, in the thin disguise of Robin Hood,"
6276,FITZWALTER,"Succours the Saxon outlaws, makes his house"
6277,FITZWALTER,"A refuge for them, lavishes his wealth"
6278,FITZWALTER,To feed their sick and needy.

6295,FITZWALTER,"And those who have must keep, or lose the power"
6296,FITZWALTER,Even to help themselves. No--he must doff
6297,FITZWALTER,"His green disguise of Robin Hood for ever,"
6298,FITZWALTER,And wear his natural coat of Huntingdon.

6302,ROBIN,"Ah, which is the disguise? Day after day"
6303,ROBIN,"We rise and put our social armour on,"
6304,ROBIN,A different mask for every friend; but steel
6305,ROBIN,"Always to case our hearts. We are all so wrapped,"
6306,ROBIN,"So swathed, so muffled in habitual thought"
6307,ROBIN,That now I swear we do not know our souls
6308,ROBIN,"Or bodies from their winding-sheets; but Custom,"
6309,ROBIN,"Custom, the great god Custom, all day long"
6310,ROBIN,Shovels the dirt upon us where we lie
6311,ROBIN,Buried alive and dreaming that we stand
6312,ROBIN,"Upright and royal. Sir, I have great doubts"
6313,ROBIN,"About this world, doubts if we have the right"
6314,ROBIN,To sit down here for this betrothal feast
6315,ROBIN,"And gorge ourselves with plenty, when we know"
6316,ROBIN,That for the scraps and crumbs which we let fall
6317,ROBIN,"And never miss, children would kiss our hands"
6318,ROBIN,And women weep in gratitude. Suppose
6319,ROBIN,"A man fell wounded at your gates, you'd not"
6320,ROBIN,Pass on and smile and leave him there to die.
6321,ROBIN,And can a few short miles of distance blind you?
6322,ROBIN,"Miles, nay, a furlong is enough to close"
6323,ROBIN,The gates of mercy. Must we thrust our hands
6324,ROBIN,Into the wounds before we can believe?
6325,ROBIN,"Oh, is our sight so thick and gross? We came,"
6326,ROBIN,"We saw, we conquered with the Conqueror."
6327,ROBIN,We gave ourselves broad lands; and when our king
6328,ROBIN,Desired a wider hunting ground we set
6329,ROBIN,Hundreds of Saxon homes a-blaze and tossed
6330,ROBIN,Women and children back into the fire
6331,ROBIN,If they but wrung their hands against our will.
6332,ROBIN,"And so we made our forest, and its leaves"
6333,ROBIN,"Were pitiful, more pitiful than man."
6334,ROBIN,They gave our homeless victims the same refuge
6335,ROBIN,And happy hiding place they give the birds
6336,ROBIN,"And foxes. Then we made our forest-laws,"
6337,ROBIN,"And he that dared to hunt, even for food,"
6338,ROBIN,"Even on the ground where we had burned his hut,"
6339,ROBIN,"The ground we had drenched with his own kindred's blood,"
6340,ROBIN,"Poor foolish churl, why, we put out his eyes"
6341,ROBIN,"With red-hot irons, cut off both his hands,"
6342,ROBIN,"Torture him with such horrors that ... Christ God,"

6713,FITZWALTER,And sorely disappointed in that youth
6714,FITZWALTER,Who has incurred your own displeasure.
6715,FITZWALTER,
6716,JOHN,JOHN
6717,JOHN,
6718,JOHN,Ah?
6719,JOHN,Your future son-in-law?
6720,JOHN,
6721,FITZWALTER,FITZWALTER
6722,FITZWALTER,
6723,FITZWALTER,Never on earth!
6724,FITZWALTER,He is outlawed--
6725,FITZWALTER,
6726,MARIAN,MARIAN
6727,MARIAN,
6728,MARIAN,Outlawed!
6729,MARIAN,
6730,FITZWALTER,FITZWALTER
6731,FITZWALTER,
6732,FITZWALTER,And I wash my hands
6733,FITZWALTER,Of Huntingdon. His shadow shall not darken
6734,FITZWALTER,My doors again!
6735,FITZWALTER,
6736,JOHN,JOHN
6737,JOHN,
6738,JOHN,That's vehement! Ha! ha!
6739,JOHN,And what does Lady Marian say?
6740,JOHN,
6741,MARIAN,MARIAN
6742,MARIAN,
6743,MARIAN,My father
6744,MARIAN,Speaks hastily. I am not so unworthy.
6745,MARIAN,
6746,FITZWALTER,FITZWALTER
6747,FITZWALTER,
6748,FITZWALTER,Unworthy?
6749,FITZWALTER,
6750,MARIAN,MARIAN
6751,MARIAN,
6752,MARIAN,"Yes, unworthy as to desert him"
6753,MARIAN,Because he is in trouble--the bravest man
6754,MARIAN,In England since the days of Hereward.
6755,MARIAN,You know why he is outlawed!
6756,MARIAN,
6757,FITZWALTER,FITZWALTER
6758,FITZWALTER,
6759,FITZWALTER,[_To PRINCE JOHN._]
6760,FITZWALTER,
6761,FITZWALTER,"Sir, she speaks"
6762,FITZWALTER,As the spoilt child of her old father's dotage.
6763,FITZWALTER,Give her no heed. She shall not meet with him
6764,FITZWALTER,"On earth again, and till she promise this,"
6765,FITZWALTER,She'll sun herself within the castle garden
6766,FITZWALTER,And never cross the draw-bridge.
6767,FITZWALTER,
6768,MARIAN,MARIAN
6769,MARIAN,
6770,MARIAN,Then I'll swim
6771,MARIAN,The moat!
6772,MARIAN,
6773,FRIAR TUCK,FRIAR TUCK
6774,FRIAR TUCK,
6775,FRIAR TUCK,Ha! ha! well spoken.
6776,FRIAR TUCK,
6777,MARIAN,MARIAN
6778,MARIAN,
6779,MARIAN,"Oh, you forget,"
6780,MARIAN,"Father, you quite forget there is a King;"
6781,MARIAN,"And, when the King comes home from the Crusade,"
6782,MARIAN,Will you forget Prince John and change once more?
6783,MARIAN,
6784,MARIAN,[_Murmurs of assent from the FORESTERS._]
6785,MARIAN,
6786,JOHN,JOHN
6787,JOHN,
6788,JOHN,Enough of this.
6789,JOHN,"Though I be prince, I am vice-gerent too!"
6790,JOHN,"Fitzwalter, I would have some private talk"
6791,JOHN,With you and Lady Marian. Bid your guests
6792,JOHN,Remove a little--
6793,JOHN,
6794,FITZWALTER,FITZWALTER
6795,FITZWALTER,
6796,FITZWALTER,I'll lead them all within!
6797,FITZWALTER,"And let them make what cheer they may. Come, friends."
6798,FITZWALTER,
6799,FITZWALTER,[_He leads them up the stairs to the inner room._]
6800,FITZWALTER,
6801,FITZWALTER,"My lord, I shall return immediately!"
6802,FITZWALTER,
6803,FITZWALTER,[_Exeunt FITZWALTER and the guests._]
6804,FITZWALTER,
6805,JOHN,JOHN
6806,JOHN,
6807,JOHN,Marian!
6808,JOHN,
6809,MARIAN,MARIAN
6810,MARIAN,
6811,MARIAN,My lord!
6812,MARIAN,
6813,JOHN,JOHN
6814,JOHN,
6815,JOHN,[_Drawing close to her._]
6816,JOHN,
6817,JOHN,I have come to urge a plea
6818,JOHN,On your behalf as well as on my own!
6819,JOHN,"Listen, you may not know it--I must tell you."
6820,JOHN,"I have watched your beauty growing like a flower,"
6821,JOHN,"With--why should I not say it--worship; yes,"
6822,JOHN,"Marian, I will not hide it."
6823,JOHN,
6824,MARIAN,MARIAN
6825,MARIAN,
6826,MARIAN,"Sir, you are mad!"
6827,MARIAN,"Sir, and your bride, your bride, not three months wedded!"
6828,MARIAN,You cannot mean ...
6829,MARIAN,
6830,JOHN,JOHN
6831,JOHN,
6832,JOHN,"Listen to me! Ah, Marian,"
6833,JOHN,You'd be more merciful if you knew all!
6834,JOHN,D'you think that princes wed to please themselves?
6835,JOHN,
6836,MARIAN,MARIAN
6837,MARIAN,
6838,MARIAN,"Sir, English maidens do; and I am plighted"
6839,MARIAN,"Not to a prince, but to an outlawed man."
6840,MARIAN,
6841,JOHN,JOHN
6842,JOHN,
6843,JOHN,"Listen to me! One word! Marian, one word!"
6844,JOHN,"I never meant you harm! Indeed, what harm"
6845,JOHN,Could come of this? Is not your father poor?
6846,JOHN,I'd make him rich! Is not your lover outlawed?
6847,JOHN,I'd save him from the certain death that waits him.
6848,JOHN,You say the forest-laws afflict your soul
6849,JOHN,And his--you say you'd die for their repeal!
6850,JOHN,Well--I'll repeal them. All the churls in England
6851,JOHN,Shall bless your name and mix it in their prayers
6852,JOHN,With heaven itself.
6853,JOHN,
6854,MARIAN,MARIAN
6855,MARIAN,
6856,MARIAN,The price?
6857,MARIAN,
6858,JOHN,JOHN
6859,JOHN,
6860,JOHN,You call it that!
6861,JOHN,"To let me lay the world before your feet,"
6862,JOHN,To let me take this little hand in mine.
6863,JOHN,Why should I hide my love from you?
6864,JOHN,
6865,MARIAN,MARIAN
6866,MARIAN,
6867,MARIAN,"No more,"
6868,MARIAN,"I'll hear no more! You are a prince, you say?"
6869,MARIAN,
6870,JOHN,JOHN
6871,JOHN,
6872,JOHN,"One word--suppose it some small sacrifice,"
6873,JOHN,To save those churls for whom you say your heart
6874,JOHN,Bleeds; yet you will not lift your little finger
6875,JOHN,"To save them! And what hinders you?--A breath,"
6876,JOHN,"A dream, a golden rule! Can you not break it"
6877,JOHN,For a much greater end?
6878,JOHN,
6879,MARIAN,MARIAN
6880,MARIAN,
6881,MARIAN,I'd die to save them.
6882,MARIAN,
6883,JOHN,JOHN
6884,JOHN,
6885,JOHN,Then live to save them.
6886,JOHN,
6887,MARIAN,MARIAN
6888,MARIAN,
6889,MARIAN,"No, you will not let me;"
6890,MARIAN,D'you think that bartering my soul will help
6891,MARIAN,"To save another? If there's no way but this,"
6892,MARIAN,"Then through my lips those suffering hundreds cry,"
6893,MARIAN,"We choose the suffering. All that is good in them,"
6894,MARIAN,"All you have left, all you have not destroyed,"
6895,MARIAN,"Cries out against you: and I'll go to them,"
6896,MARIAN,Suffer and toil and love and die with them
6897,MARIAN,Rather than touch your hand. You over-rate
6898,MARIAN,Your power to hurt our souls. You are mistaken!
6899,MARIAN,There is a golden rule!
6900,MARIAN,
6901,JOHN,JOHN
6902,JOHN,
6903,JOHN,And with such lips
6904,JOHN,You take to preaching! I was a fool to worry
6905,JOHN,Your soul with reason. With hair like yours--it's hopeless!
6906,JOHN,But Marian--you shall hear me.
6907,JOHN,
6908,JOHN,[_He catches her in his arms._]
6909,JOHN,
6910,JOHN,"Yes, by God,"
6911,JOHN,"Marian, you shall! I love you."
6912,JOHN,
6913,MARIAN,MARIAN
6914,MARIAN,
6915,MARIAN,[_Struggling._]
6916,MARIAN,
6917,MARIAN,You should not live!
6918,MARIAN,
6919,JOHN,JOHN
6920,JOHN,
6921,JOHN,"One kiss, then! Devil take it."
6922,JOHN,
6923,JOHN,[_Enter FITZWALTER above._]
6924,JOHN,
6925,MARIAN,MARIAN
6926,MARIAN,
6927,MARIAN,[_Wresting herself free._]
6928,MARIAN,
6929,MARIAN,You should not live!
6930,MARIAN,Were I a man and not a helpless girl
6931,MARIAN,You should not live!
6932,MARIAN,
6933,JOHN,JOHN
6934,JOHN,
6935,JOHN,"Come, now, that's very wicked."
6936,JOHN,See how these murderous words affright your father.
6937,JOHN,"My good Fitzwalter, there's no need to look"
6938,JOHN,So ghastly. For your sake and hers and mine
6939,JOHN,I have been trying to make your girl forget
6940,JOHN,The name of Huntingdon. A few short months
6941,JOHN,At our gay court would blot his memory out!
6942,JOHN,"I promise her a life of dazzling pleasures,"
6943,JOHN,"And, in return she flies at me--a tigress--"
6944,JOHN,Clamouring for my blood! Try to persuade her!
6945,JOHN,
6946,FITZWALTER,FITZWALTER
6947,FITZWALTER,
6948,FITZWALTER,"My lord, you are very good. She must decide"
6949,FITZWALTER,Herself.

6951,JOHN,JOHN
6952,JOHN,
6953,JOHN,[_Angrily._]
6954,JOHN,
6955,JOHN,I'll not be trifled with! I hold
6956,JOHN,"The hand of friendship out and you evade it,"
6957,JOHN,"The moment I am gone, back comes your outlaw."
6958,JOHN,You say you have no power with your own child!
6959,JOHN,"Well, then I'll take her back this very night;"
6960,JOHN,Back to the court with me. How do I know
6961,JOHN,What treasons you are hatching here? I'll take her
6962,JOHN,As hostage for yourself.
6963,JOHN,
6964,FITZWALTER,FITZWALTER
6965,FITZWALTER,
6966,FITZWALTER,"My lord, you jest!"
6967,FITZWALTER,I have sworn to you.
6968,FITZWALTER,
6969,JOHN,JOHN
6970,JOHN,
6971,JOHN,"No more! If you be loyal,"
6972,JOHN,What cause have you to fear?
6973,JOHN,
6974,FITZWALTER,FITZWALTER
6975,FITZWALTER,
6976,FITZWALTER,"My lord, I'll give"
6977,FITZWALTER,A hundred other pledges; but not this.
6978,FITZWALTER,
6979,JOHN,JOHN
6980,JOHN,
6981,JOHN,"By heaven, will you dictate your terms to me?"
6982,JOHN,I say that she shall come back to the court
6983,JOHN,"This very night! Ho, there, my men."
6984,JOHN,
6985,JOHN,[_Enter JOHN'S retainers._]
6986,JOHN,
6987,JOHN,Escort
6988,JOHN,This lady back with us.
6989,JOHN,
6990,FITZWALTER,FITZWALTER
6991,FITZWALTER,
6992,FITZWALTER,"Back there, keep back. Prince or no prince,"
6993,FITZWALTER,I say she shall not go!
6994,FITZWALTER,
6995,FITZWALTER,[_He draws his sword._]
6996,FITZWALTER,
6997,FITZWALTER,I'd rather see her
6998,FITZWALTER,Begging in rags with outlawed Huntingdon
6999,FITZWALTER,Than that one finger of yours should soil her glove.
7000,FITZWALTER,
7001,JOHN,JOHN
7002,JOHN,
7003,JOHN,"So here's an end of fawning, here's the truth,"
7004,JOHN,"My old white-bearded hypocrite. Come, take her,"
7005,JOHN,Waste no more time. Let not the old fool daunt you
7006,JOHN,With that great skewer.

7013,FITZWALTER,"Since you will drive me to my last resort,"
7014,FITZWALTER,"Break down my walls, and hound me to the forest,"
7015,FITZWALTER,"This is the truth! Out of my gates! Ho, help!"
7016,FITZWALTER,A Robin Hood! A Robin Hood!
7017,FITZWALTER,
7018,FITZWALTER,[_There is a clamour from the upper room. The doors are flung
7019,FITZWALTER,open and the FORESTERS appear at the head of the steps._]

7025,FRIAR TUCK,A Robin?
7026,FRIAR TUCK,Who calls on Robin Hood? His men are here
7027,FRIAR TUCK,To answer.
7028,FRIAR TUCK,
7029,FITZWALTER,FITZWALTER

7036,FRIAR TUCK,
7037,FRIAR TUCK,"Sir, I perceive you are a man of wisdom,"
7038,FRIAR TUCK,So let me counsel you. There's not a lad
7039,FRIAR TUCK,"Up yonder, but at four-score yards can shoot"
7040,FRIAR TUCK,A swallow on the wing. They have drunken deep.
7041,FRIAR TUCK,I cannot answer but their hands might loose
7042,FRIAR TUCK,Their shafts before they know it. Now shall I give
7043,FRIAR TUCK,"The word? Ready, my lads!"
7044,FRIAR TUCK,
7045,FRIAR TUCK,[_The FORESTERS make ready to shoot. JOHN hesitates for a
7046,FRIAR TUCK,moment._]

7049,JOHN,
7050,JOHN,"My Lady Marian,"

7053,JOHN,[_She pays no heed._]
7054,JOHN,
7055,JOHN,"Farewell, then! I have five-score men at hand!"
7056,JOHN,And they shall be but lightning to the hell
7057,JOHN,"Of my revenge, Fitzwalter. I will not leave"
7058,JOHN,One stone upon another. From this night's work
7059,JOHN,Shall God Himself not save you.

7068,FRIAR TUCK,I have confessed him! Shall I bid 'em shoot?
7069,FRIAR TUCK,'Twill save a world of trouble.

7072,FITZWALTER,
7073,FITZWALTER,No; or the King

7075,FITZWALTER,"Drive them out of my gates, then raise the drawbridge"
7076,FITZWALTER,"And let none cross. Oh, I foresaw, foretold!"
7077,FITZWALTER,Robin has wrecked us all!

7093,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"Ah, well, the prince"

7095,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"These villains are a sort of ploughshare, lady,"
7096,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"And where they plough, who knows what wheat may spring!"
7097,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,The lights are burning low and very low;
7098,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"So, Lady Marian, let me tell my dream."
7099,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,There was a forester that bled to death
7100,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,Because of four grey walls and a black nun

7102,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"Though I am but your fool, your Shadow-of-a-Leaf,"
7103,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"Dancing before the wild winds of the future,"
7104,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,I feel them thrilling through my tattered wits
7105,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,Long ere your wisdom feels them. My poor brain
7106,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,Is like a harp hung in a willow-tree
7107,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"Swept by the winds of fate. I am but a fool,"
7108,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"But oh, beware of that black-hooded nun."

7160,ELINOR,Yes! Yes! I donned this uncouth garb
7161,ELINOR,To pass through your besiegers. If Prince John

7191,ELINOR,By dawn Prince John will have five hundred men

7655,ROBIN,"What? Silent still? Sirrah, this hazel wand"
7656,ROBIN,"Shall lace thee till thou tingle, top to toe."
7657,ROBIN,I'll ...

7659,MARIAN,MARIAN
7660,MARIAN,
7661,MARIAN,[_Unmuffling._]
7662,MARIAN,
7663,MARIAN,Robin!
7664,MARIAN,
7665,ROBIN,ROBIN
7666,ROBIN,
7667,ROBIN,[_Catches her in his arms with a cry._]
7668,ROBIN,
7669,ROBIN,Marian! Marian!
7670,ROBIN,
7671,MARIAN,MARIAN
7672,MARIAN,
7673,MARIAN,"Fie upon you,"
7674,MARIAN,"Robin, you did not know me."
7675,MARIAN,
7676,ROBIN,ROBIN
7677,ROBIN,
7678,ROBIN,[_Embracing her._]
7679,ROBIN,
7680,ROBIN,"Oh, you seemed"
7681,ROBIN,"Ten thousand miles away. This is not moonlight,"
7682,ROBIN,And I am not Endymion. Could I dream
7683,ROBIN,My Dian would come wandering through the fern
7684,ROBIN,Before the sunset? Even that rose your face
7685,ROBIN,You muffled in its own green leaves.
7686,ROBIN,
7687,MARIAN,MARIAN
7688,MARIAN,
7689,MARIAN,"But you,"
7690,MARIAN,"Were hidden in the heart of Sherwood, Robin,"
7691,MARIAN,"Hidden behind a million mighty boughs,"
7692,MARIAN,And yet I found you.
7693,MARIAN,
7694,ROBIN,ROBIN
7695,ROBIN,
7696,ROBIN,"Ay, the young moon stole"
7697,ROBIN,In pity down to her poor shepherd boy;
7698,ROBIN,But he could never climb the fleecy clouds
7699,ROBIN,"Up to her throne, never could print one kiss"
7700,ROBIN,On her immortal lips. He lay asleep
7701,ROBIN,"Among the poppies and the crags of Latmos,"
7702,ROBIN,"And she came down to him, his queen stole down."
7703,ROBIN,
7704,MARIAN,MARIAN
7705,MARIAN,
7706,MARIAN,"Oh, Robin, first a rose and then a moon,"
7707,MARIAN,"A rose that breaks at a breath and falls to your feet,"
7708,MARIAN,"The fickle moon--Oh, hide me from the world;"
7709,MARIAN,For there they say love goes by the same law!
7710,MARIAN,Let me be outlawed then. I cannot change.
7711,MARIAN,"Sweetheart, sweetheart, Prince John will hunt me down!"
7712,MARIAN,Prince John--Queen Elinor will hunt me down!
7713,MARIAN,
7714,ROBIN,ROBIN
7715,ROBIN,
7716,ROBIN,"Queen Elinor! Nay, but tell me what this means?"
7717,ROBIN,How came you here?
7718,ROBIN,
7719,MARIAN,MARIAN
7720,MARIAN,
7721,MARIAN,"The Queen--she came last night,"
7722,MARIAN,Made it an odious kind of praise to me
7723,MARIAN,"That he, not three months wedded to his bride,"
7724,MARIAN,Should--pah!
7725,MARIAN,And then she said five hundred men
7726,MARIAN,Were watching round the borders of the wood;
7727,MARIAN,"But she herself would take me safely through them,"
7728,MARIAN,"Said that I should be safer here with Robin,"
7729,MARIAN,She had your name so pat--and I gave way.
7730,MARIAN,
7731,MARIAN,[_Enter QUEEN ELINOR behind. She conceals herself to listen._]
7732,MARIAN,
7733,ROBIN,ROBIN
7734,ROBIN,
7735,ROBIN,"Marian, she might have trapped you to Prince John."
7736,ROBIN,
7737,MARIAN,MARIAN
7738,MARIAN,
7739,MARIAN,No; no; I think she wanted me to guide her
7740,MARIAN,Here to your hiding place. She wished to see you
7741,MARIAN,"Herself, unknown to John, I know not why."
7742,MARIAN,It was my only way. Her skilful tongue
7743,MARIAN,"Quite won my father over, made him think,"
7744,MARIAN,"Poor father, clinging to his lands again,"
7745,MARIAN,"He yet might save them. And so, without ado"
7746,MARIAN,"(It will be greatly to the joy of Much,"
7747,MARIAN,"Your funny little man), I bade my maid"
7748,MARIAN,"Jenny, go pack her small belongings up"
7749,MARIAN,"This morning, and to follow with Friar Tuck"
7750,MARIAN,And Widow Scarlet. They'll be here anon.
7751,MARIAN,
7752,ROBIN,ROBIN
7753,ROBIN,
7754,ROBIN,Where did you leave the Queen?
7755,ROBIN,
7756,MARIAN,MARIAN
7757,MARIAN,
7758,MARIAN,"Robin, she tried"
7759,MARIAN,To kill me! We were deep within the wood
7760,MARIAN,"And she began to tell me a wild tale,"
7761,MARIAN,Saying that I reminded her of days
7762,MARIAN,"When Robin was her page, and how you came"
7763,MARIAN,"To Court, a breath of April in her life,"
7764,MARIAN,"And how you worshipped her, and how she grew"
7765,MARIAN,To love you. But she saw you loved me best
7766,MARIAN,"(So would she mix her gall and lies with honey),"
7767,MARIAN,So she would let you go. And then she tried
7768,MARIAN,"To turn my heart against you, bade me think"
7769,MARIAN,"Of all the perils of your outlawry,"
7770,MARIAN,Then flamed with anger when she found my heart
7771,MARIAN,Steadfast; and when I told her we drew nigh
7772,MARIAN,"The cave, she bade me wait and let her come"
7773,MARIAN,"First, here, to speak with you. Some devil's trick"
7774,MARIAN,"Gleamed in her smile, the way some women have"
7775,MARIAN,"Of smiling with their lips, wreathing the skin"
7776,MARIAN,"In pleasant ripples, laughing with their teeth,"
7777,MARIAN,"While the cold eyes watch, cruel as a snake's"
7778,MARIAN,That fascinates a bird. I'd not obey her.
7779,MARIAN,She whipped a dagger out. Had it not been
7780,MARIAN,"For Shadow-of-a-Leaf, who dogged us all the way,"
7781,MARIAN,"Poor faithful fool, and leapt out at her hand,"
7782,MARIAN,She would have killed me. Then she darted away
7783,MARIAN,"Like a wild thing into the woods, trying to find"
7784,MARIAN,Your hiding place most like.
7785,MARIAN,
7786,ROBIN,ROBIN
7787,ROBIN,
7788,ROBIN,"O Marian, why,"
7789,ROBIN,"Why did you trust her? Listen, who comes here?"
7790,ROBIN,
7791,ROBIN,"[_Enter FRIAR TUCK, JENNY and WIDOW SCARLET._]"
7792,ROBIN,
7793,ROBIN,"Ah, Friar Tuck!"

7797,MARIAN,Good Jenny!

7805,FRIAR TUCK,"O children, children, this is thirsty weather!"
7806,FRIAR TUCK,"The heads I have cracked, the ribs I have thwacked, the bones"
7807,FRIAR TUCK,"I have bashed with my good quarter-staff, to bring"
7808,FRIAR TUCK,These bits of womankind through Sherwood Forest.
7809,FRIAR TUCK,
7810,ROBIN,ROBIN
7811,ROBIN,
7812,ROBIN,"What, was there scuffling, friar?"

7814,FRIAR TUCK,FRIAR TUCK
7815,FRIAR TUCK,
7816,FRIAR TUCK,Some two or three

7819,JENNY,JENNY
7820,JENNY,

7825,FRIAR TUCK,
7826,FRIAR TUCK,"They've gone home,"
7827,FRIAR TUCK,Well chastened by the Church. This pastoral staff
7828,FRIAR TUCK,"Mine oaken _Pax Vobiscum_, sent 'em home"
7829,FRIAR TUCK,"To think about their sins, with watering eyes."
7830,FRIAR TUCK,"You never saw a bunch of such blue faces,"
7831,FRIAR TUCK,Bumpy and juicy as a bunch of grapes
7832,FRIAR TUCK,"Bruised in a Bacchanalian orgy, dripping"
7833,FRIAR TUCK,The reddest wine a man could wish to see.
7834,FRIAR TUCK,
7835,ROBIN,ROBIN
7836,ROBIN,
7837,ROBIN,I picture it--those big brown hands of thine
7838,ROBIN,"Grape-gathering at their throttles, ha! ha! ha!"

7840,ROBIN,
7841,WIDOW SCARLET,WIDOW SCARLET
7842,WIDOW SCARLET,
7843,WIDOW SCARLET,"O master, master, they have named the day"
7844,WIDOW SCARLET,For killing of my boy.
7845,WIDOW SCARLET,
7846,ROBIN,ROBIN
7847,ROBIN,
7848,ROBIN,They have named the day
7849,ROBIN,"For setting of him free, then, my good dame."
7850,ROBIN,"Be not afraid. We shall be there, eh, Friar?"
7851,ROBIN,"Grape-gathering, eh?"
7852,ROBIN,
7853,FRIAR,FRIAR
7854,FRIAR,
7855,FRIAR,Thou'lt not be there thyself.
7856,FRIAR,"My son, the game's too dangerous now, methinks."
7857,FRIAR,
7858,ROBIN,ROBIN
7859,ROBIN,
7860,ROBIN,I shall be there myself. The game's too good
7861,ROBIN,"To lose. We'll all be there. You're not afraid,"
7862,ROBIN,"Marian, to spend a few short hours alone"
7863,ROBIN,Here in the woods with Jenny.
7864,ROBIN,

7871,ROBIN,
7872,ROBIN,"We shall want every hand that day,"
7873,ROBIN,And you'll be safe enough. You know we go
7874,ROBIN,"Disguised as gaping yokels, old blind men,"
7875,ROBIN,"With patches on their eyes, poor wandering beggars,"
7876,ROBIN,Pedlars with pins and poking-sticks to sell;
7877,ROBIN,And when the time is come--a merry blast
7878,ROBIN,Rings out upon a bugle and suddenly
7879,ROBIN,The Sheriff is aware that Sherwood Forest
7880,ROBIN,Has thrust its green boughs up beneath his feet.
7881,ROBIN,"Off go the cloaks and all is Lincoln green,"
7882,ROBIN,Great thwacking clubs and twanging bows of yew.
7883,ROBIN,"Oh, we break up like nature thro' the laws"
7884,ROBIN,"Of that dark world; and then, good Widow Scarlet,"
7885,ROBIN,Back to the cave we come and your good Will
7886,ROBIN,Winds his big arm about you once again.
7887,ROBIN,"Go, Friar, take her in and make her cosy."
7888,ROBIN,"Jenny, your Much will grow three feet at least"
7889,ROBIN,With joy to welcome you. He is in the cave.

7894,FRIAR TUCK,
7895,FRIAR TUCK,Now for a good bowse at a drinking can.
7896,FRIAR TUCK,"I've got one cooling in the cave, unless"
7897,FRIAR TUCK,"That rascal, Little John, has drunk it all."

7905,JENNY,"Mistress, I haven't spoke a word to you"

7916,JENNY,For Much. I haven't spoke a word with you

7919,MARIAN,MARIAN
7920,MARIAN,
7921,MARIAN,"Wait, Jenny, then, I'll come and talk with you."
7922,MARIAN,"Robin, she is a tyrant; but she loves me."
7923,MARIAN,"And if I do not go, she'll pout and sulk"
7924,MARIAN,Three days on end. But she's a wondrous girl.
7925,MARIAN,She'd work until she dropped for me. Poor Jenny!
7926,MARIAN,
7927,ROBIN,ROBIN
7928,ROBIN,
7929,ROBIN,"That's a quaint tyranny. Go, dear Marian, go;"
7930,ROBIN,But not for long. We have so much to say.
7931,ROBIN,Come quickly back.

7944,ELINOR,
7945,ROBIN,ROBIN
7946,ROBIN,
7947,ROBIN,It seems you have heard whate'er I had to say.
7948,ROBIN,
7949,ELINOR,ELINOR
7950,ELINOR,
7951,ELINOR,Surely you cannot quite forget those days
7952,ELINOR,When you were kind to me. Do you remember
7953,ELINOR,The sunset through that oriel?
7954,ELINOR,
7955,ROBIN,ROBIN
7956,ROBIN,
7957,ROBIN,"Ay, a god"
7958,ROBIN,"Grinning thro' a horse-collar at a pitiful page,"
7959,ROBIN,Dazed with the first red gleam of what he thought
7960,ROBIN,"Life, as the trouveres find it! I am ashamed,"
7961,ROBIN,Remembering how your quick tears blinded me!
7962,ROBIN,
7963,ROBIN,

7965,ELINOR,
7966,ELINOR,Ashamed! You--you--that in my bitter grief

7968,ELINOR,
7969,ROBIN,ROBIN
7970,ROBIN,
7971,ROBIN,"I know! I thought your woes,"
7972,ROBIN,"Those tawdry relics of your treacheries,"
7973,ROBIN,Wrongs quite unparalleled. I would have fought
7974,ROBIN,Roland himself to prove you spotless then.

7978,ELINOR,"Oh, you speak thus to me! Robin, beware!"

7981,ELINOR,"Reject me, humble me to the dust before"

7993,ELINOR,Trust me--for I can wind my poor Prince John
7994,ELINOR,Around my little finger. Who knows--with me
7995,ELINOR,To help you--there are but my two sons' lives

8001,ROBIN,Are you so wrapped

8011,ELINOR,
8012,ROBIN,ROBIN
8013,ROBIN,
8014,ROBIN,No--not that--that sickening plea
8015,ROBIN,Of truth in treachery. Treachery cannot live
8016,ROBIN,With truth. The soul wherein they are wedded dies
8017,ROBIN,Of leprosy.

8073,MARIAN,
8074,ROBIN,ROBIN
8075,ROBIN,
8076,ROBIN,Forget it all!
8077,ROBIN,She is so tangled in those lies the world

8079,ROBIN,"Marian, for God's sake, let us quite forget"
8080,ROBIN,"That nightmare! Oh, that perfect brow of yours,"
8081,ROBIN,"Those perfect eyes, pure as the violet wells"
8082,ROBIN,That only mirror heaven and are not dimmed
8083,ROBIN,Except by clouds that drift thro' heaven and catch
8084,ROBIN,God's glory in the sunset and the dawn.

8088,MARIAN,It is enough for them simply to speak
8089,MARIAN,The love they hold for you. But--I still fear.
8090,MARIAN,Robin--think you--she might have overheard
8091,MARIAN,Your plan--the rescue of Will Scarlet?
8092,MARIAN,
8093,ROBIN,ROBIN
8094,ROBIN,
8095,ROBIN,Why--
8096,ROBIN,"No--No--some time had passed, and yet--she seemed"
8097,ROBIN,"To have heard your charge against her! No, she guessed it."
8098,ROBIN,Come--let us brush these cobwebs from our minds.
8099,ROBIN,Look how the first white star begins to tremble
8100,ROBIN,Like a big blossom in that sycamore.

8112,FRIAR TUCK,Presume to call our Robin Hood or any
8113,FRIAR TUCK,"By name of Earl, lord, baron, knight or squire,"
8114,FRIAR TUCK,But simply by their names as men and brothers:
8115,FRIAR TUCK,"Second, that Lady Marian while she shares"
8116,FRIAR TUCK,Our outlaw life in Sherwood shall be called
8117,FRIAR TUCK,"Simply Maid Marian. Thirdly, we that follow"
8118,FRIAR TUCK,"Robin, shall never in thought or word or deed"
8119,FRIAR TUCK,"Do harm to widow, wife or maid; but hold,"
8120,FRIAR TUCK,"Each, for his mother's or sister's or sweetheart's sake,"
8121,FRIAR TUCK,"The glory of womanhood, a sacred thing,"
8122,FRIAR TUCK,"A star twixt earth and heaven. Fourth, whomsoever"
8123,FRIAR TUCK,Ye meet in Sherwood ye shall bring to dine
8124,FRIAR TUCK,"With Robin, saving carriers, posts and folk"
8125,FRIAR TUCK,That ride with food to serve the market towns

9048,JENNY,I don't like those gods.
9049,JENNY,"I never cared for them. But, as for Much,"
9050,JENNY,Much is the best of all the merry men.
9051,JENNY,"And, mistress, O, he speaks so beautifully,"
9052,JENNY,It _might_ be just an Echo from blue hills
9053,JENNY,"Far, far away! You see he's quite a scholar:"
9054,JENNY,"Much, more an' most (That's what he calls the three"
9055,JENNY,"Greasy caparisons--much, more an' most)!"
9056,JENNY,You see they thought that being so very small
9057,JENNY,"They could not make him grow to be a man,"
9058,JENNY,They'd make a scholar of him instead. The Friar
9059,JENNY,"Taught him his letters. He can write his name,"
9060,JENNY,"And mine, and yours, just like a missal book,"
9061,JENNY,In lovely colours; and he always draws
9062,JENNY,The first big letter of JENNY like a tree
9063,JENNY,With naked Cupids hiding in the branches.
9064,JENNY,"Mistress, I don't believe you hear one word"
9065,JENNY,I ever speak to you! Your eyes are always
9066,JENNY,That far and far away.

9074,JENNY,"Well, when he draws the first big M of yours,"
9075,JENNY,"He makes it like a bridge from earth to heaven,"
9076,JENNY,With white-winged angels passing up and down;
9077,JENNY,"And, underneath the bridge, in a black stream,"
9078,JENNY,He puts the drowning face of the bad Prince
9079,JENNY,"Holding his wicked hands out, while a devil"
9080,JENNY,Stands on the bank and with a pointed stake
9081,JENNY,Keeps him from landing--

9106,JOHN,"To come with me, to change these cheerless woods"
9107,JOHN,"For something queenlier? If I be not mistaken,"
9108,JOHN,You have had time to tire of that dark cave.
9109,JOHN,"Was I not right, now? Surely you can see"
9110,JOHN,Those tresses were not meant to waste their gold
9111,JOHN,"Upon this desert. Nay, but Marian, hear me."
9112,JOHN,I do not jest.
9113,JOHN,
9114,JOHN,"[_At a sign from MARIAN, JENNY goes quickly inside the cave._]"

9121,JOHN,I see you think
9122,JOHN,A little better of me! Out in the wood
9123,JOHN,"There waits a palfrey for you, and the stirrup"
9124,JOHN,"Longs, as I long, to clasp your dainty foot."
9125,JOHN,I am very sure by this you must be tired

9178,MARIAN,"Prince or no prince, king or no king, I'll kill you"

10043,MARIAN,MARIAN
10044,MARIAN,
10045,MARIAN,"Now you mock me,"
10046,MARIAN,But you'll be back before the masque begins.

10054,MARIAN,It is a month
10055,MARIAN,To-day since we were married. Did you know it?
10056,MARIAN,"Fie, I believe you had forgotten, Robin."
10057,MARIAN,
10058,ROBIN,ROBIN
10059,ROBIN,
10060,ROBIN,"I had, almost. If marriage make the moons"
10061,ROBIN,"Fly, as this month has flown, we shall be old"
10062,ROBIN,And grey in our graves before we know it.
10063,ROBIN,I wish that we could chain old Father Time.
10064,ROBIN,
10065,MARIAN,MARIAN
10066,MARIAN,
10067,MARIAN,And break his glass into ten thousand pieces.
10068,MARIAN,
10069,ROBIN,ROBIN
10070,ROBIN,
10071,ROBIN,"And drown his cruel scythe ten fathom deep,"
10072,ROBIN,Under the bright blue sea whence Love was born:
10073,ROBIN,
10074,MARIAN,MARIAN
10075,MARIAN,
10076,MARIAN,"Ah, but we have not parted all this month"
10077,MARIAN,"More than a garden's breadth, an arrow's flight:"
10078,MARIAN,Time will be dead till you come back again.
10079,MARIAN,Four hours of absence make four centuries!
10080,MARIAN,"Do you remember how the song goes, Robin,"
10081,MARIAN,That bids true lovers not to grieve at parting
10082,MARIAN,"Often? for Nature gently severs them thus,"
10083,MARIAN,"Training them up with kind and tender art,"
10084,MARIAN,For the great day when they must part for ever.
10085,MARIAN,
10086,ROBIN,ROBIN
10087,ROBIN,
10088,ROBIN,"Do you believe it, Marian?"
10089,ROBIN,
10090,MARIAN,MARIAN
10091,MARIAN,
10092,MARIAN,No; for love
10093,MARIAN,"Buried beneath the dust of life and death,"
10094,MARIAN,"Would wait for centuries of centuries,"
10095,MARIAN,"Ages of ages, until God remembered,"
10096,MARIAN,"And, through that perishing cloud-wrack, face looked up"
10097,MARIAN,Once more to loving face.
10098,MARIAN,
10099,ROBIN,ROBIN
10100,ROBIN,
10101,ROBIN,Your hope--and mine!
10102,ROBIN,"Is not a man's poor memory, indeed,"
10103,ROBIN,A daily resurrection? Your hope--and mine!
10104,ROBIN,
10105,MARIAN,MARIAN
10106,MARIAN,
10107,MARIAN,And all the world's at heart! I do believe it.
10108,MARIAN,
10109,ROBIN,ROBIN
10110,ROBIN,
10111,ROBIN,And I--if only that so many souls
10112,ROBIN,Like yours have died believing they should meet
10113,ROBIN,"Again, lovers and children, little children!"
10114,ROBIN,God will not break that trust. I have found my heaven
10115,ROBIN,"Again in you; and, though I stumble still,"
10116,ROBIN,"Your small hand leads me thro' the darkness, up"
10117,ROBIN,"And onward, to the heights I dared not see,"
10118,ROBIN,And dare not even now; but my head bows
10119,ROBIN,Above your face; I see them in your eyes.
10120,ROBIN,"Love, point me onward still!"
10121,ROBIN,
10122,ROBIN,[_He takes her in his arms._]
10123,ROBIN,
10124,ROBIN,Good-bye! Good-bye!

10130,ROBIN,ROBIN
10131,ROBIN,
10132,ROBIN,"Ay, or a little later--never fear:"
10133,ROBIN,You'll not so easily lose me.
10134,ROBIN,
10135,MARIAN,MARIAN
10136,MARIAN,
10137,MARIAN,I shall count
10138,MARIAN,The minutes!

10144,MARIAN,MARIAN
10145,MARIAN,
10146,MARIAN,"Yes, I am foolish."
10147,MARIAN,This is the first small parting we have had;
10148,MARIAN,But--you'll be back ere dusk?
10149,MARIAN,
10150,ROBIN,ROBIN
10151,ROBIN,
10152,ROBIN,[_Laughing._]
10153,ROBIN,
10154,ROBIN,"Ah, do you think"
10155,ROBIN,"That chains of steel could hold me, sweet, from you,"
10156,ROBIN,"With those two heavenly eyes to call me home,"
10157,ROBIN,Those lips to welcome me? Good-bye!
10158,ROBIN,
10159,MARIAN,MARIAN
10160,MARIAN,
10161,MARIAN,Good-bye!
10162,MARIAN,

10164,MARIAN,suddenly calls._]
10165,MARIAN,
10166,MARIAN,"Robin! Ah, well, no matter now--too late!"

10191,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,Applied to your slim fairyhood's green limbs
10192,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"Will make it painful, painful, very painful,"
10193,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,Next time your worship wishes to sit down
10194,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,Cross-legged upon a mushroom.

10210,PUCK,"Who made you such a hopeless, glorious fool"
10211,PUCK,That wise men are afraid of every word

10214,PUCK,"Fern-seed by moonlight, and to walk and talk"
10215,PUCK,"Between the lights, with urchins and with elves?"
10216,PUCK,Is there another fool twixt earth and heaven

10225,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"Now on my neck, now singing in my ears,"
10226,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,Is that to make me free of fairyland?
10227,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,No--that's enough to make the poor fool mad
10228,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,And take to human wisdom.

10241,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"With thorns, bullied with briars, baffled with stars."
10242,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,I've lain sometimes and laughed until I cried
10243,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,To see the round moon rising o'er these trees
10244,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,With that same foolish face of heavenly mirth
10245,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,Winking at lovers in the blue-bell glade.

10285,LITTLE JOHN,I'll sound yet one more call.
10286,LITTLE JOHN,They say these Courts will spoil a forester.
10287,LITTLE JOHN,It may be he has missed the way. I'd give
10288,LITTLE JOHN,My sword-hand just to hear his jolly bugle

10465,OBERON,Robin is even now
10466,OBERON,"Thrust in the great dark tower beyond the wood,"
10467,OBERON,The topmost cell where foot can never climb.

10475,OBERON,
10476,OBERON,I cannot disobey
10477,OBERON,"The word that kills the seed to raise the wheat,"
10478,OBERON,"The word that--Shadow-of-a-Leaf, I think I know"
10479,OBERON,"Now, why great kings ride out to the Crusade."

10487,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"staring after them, then vanishes with a sob, between"
10488,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,the trees. LITTLE JOHN and SCARLET appear once
10489,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,more at the mouth of the cave._]
10490,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,
10491,SCARLET,SCARLET
10492,SCARLET,
10493,SCARLET,I thought I heard a voice.

10495,SCARLET,
10496,LITTLE JOHN,LITTLE JOHN
10497,LITTLE JOHN,
10498,LITTLE JOHN,'Twas only Shadow-of-a-Leaf again. He talks
10499,LITTLE JOHN,"For hours among the ferns, plays with the flowers,"
10500,LITTLE JOHN,"And whispers to the mice, perfectly happy!"

10502,LITTLE JOHN,
10503,SCARLET,SCARLET
10504,SCARLET,
10505,SCARLET,I cannot rest for thinking that some harm
10506,SCARLET,Hath chanced to Robin. Call him yet once more.

10508,SCARLET,[_LITTLE JOHN blows his bugle. All is silent. They stand
10509,SCARLET,listening._]

10512,SCARLET,SCENE III. _A gloomy cell. ROBIN bound. PRINCE JOHN and two mercenaries.
10513,SCARLET,"A low narrow door in the background, small barred window on the left._"
10514,SCARLET,
10515,PRINCE JOHN,PRINCE JOHN
10516,PRINCE JOHN,
10517,PRINCE JOHN,[_To the Mercenaries._]
10518,PRINCE JOHN,
10519,PRINCE JOHN,Leave us a moment. I have private matters
10520,PRINCE JOHN,To lay before this friend of all the poor.
10521,PRINCE JOHN,"You may begin to build the door up now,"
10522,PRINCE JOHN,So that you do not wall me in with him.
10523,PRINCE JOHN,
10524,PRINCE JOHN,[_The two men begin filling up the doorway with rude blocks of
10525,PRINCE JOHN,masonry._]
10526,PRINCE JOHN,
10527,PRINCE JOHN,"So now, my good green foot-pad, you are trapped"
10528,PRINCE JOHN,"At last, trapped in the practice of your trade!"
10529,PRINCE JOHN,"Trapped, as you took your stolen Norman gold"
10530,PRINCE JOHN,"To what was it--a widow, or Saxon serf"
10531,PRINCE JOHN,With eye put out for breaking forest laws?
10532,PRINCE JOHN,"You hold with them, it seems. Your dainty soul"
10533,PRINCE JOHN,Sickens at our gross penalties; and so
10534,PRINCE JOHN,"We'll not inflict them on your noble self,"
10535,PRINCE JOHN,Although we have the power. There's not a soul
10536,PRINCE JOHN,Can ever tell where Robin Hood is gone.
10537,PRINCE JOHN,These walls will never echo it.
10538,PRINCE JOHN,
10539,PRINCE JOHN,[_He taps the wall with his sword._]
10540,PRINCE JOHN,
10541,PRINCE JOHN,And yet
10542,PRINCE JOHN,There surely must be finer ways to torture
10543,PRINCE JOHN,So fine a soul as yours. Was it not you
10544,PRINCE JOHN,Who gave me like a fairing to my brother
10545,PRINCE JOHN,With lofty condescension in your eyes;
10546,PRINCE JOHN,And shall I call my mercenaries in
10547,PRINCE JOHN,And bid them burn your eyes out with hot irons?
10548,PRINCE JOHN,Richard is gone--he'll never hear of it!
10549,PRINCE JOHN,"An Earl that plays the robber disappears,"
10550,PRINCE JOHN,That's all. Most like he died in some low scuffle
10551,PRINCE JOHN,Out in the greenwood. I am half inclined
10552,PRINCE JOHN,"To call for red-hot irons after all,"
10553,PRINCE JOHN,So that your sympathy with Saxon churls
10554,PRINCE JOHN,"May be more deep, you understand; and then"
10555,PRINCE JOHN,"It would be sweet for you, alone and blind,"
10556,PRINCE JOHN,To know that you could never in this life
10557,PRINCE JOHN,See Marian's face again. But no--that's bad.
10558,PRINCE JOHN,Bad art to put hope's eyes out. It destroys
10559,PRINCE JOHN,Half a man's fear to rob him of his hope.
10560,PRINCE JOHN,No; you shall drink the dregs of it. Hope shall die
10561,PRINCE JOHN,"More exquisite a death. Robin, my friend,"
10562,PRINCE JOHN,"You understand that, when I quit your presence,"
10563,PRINCE JOHN,This bare blank cell becomes your living tomb.
10564,PRINCE JOHN,Do you not comprehend? It's none so hard.
10565,PRINCE JOHN,The doorway will be built up. There will be
10566,PRINCE JOHN,"No door, you understand, but just a wall,"
10567,PRINCE JOHN,"Some six feet thick, of solid masonry."
10568,PRINCE JOHN,"Nobody will disturb you, even to bring"
10569,PRINCE JOHN,"Water or food. You'll starve--see--like a rat,"
10570,PRINCE JOHN,Bricked up and buried. But you'll have time to think
10571,PRINCE JOHN,Of how I tread a measure at the masque
10572,PRINCE JOHN,"To-night, with Marian, while her wide eyes wonder"
10573,PRINCE JOHN,Where Robin is--and old Fitzwalter smiles
10574,PRINCE JOHN,And bids his girl be gracious to the Prince
10575,PRINCE JOHN,"For his land's sake. Ah, ha! you wince at that!"
10576,PRINCE JOHN,Will you not speak a word before I go?
10577,PRINCE JOHN,"Speak, damn you!"
10578,PRINCE JOHN,
10579,PRINCE JOHN,[_He strikes ROBIN across the face with his glove. ROBIN remains
10580,PRINCE JOHN,silent._]
10581,PRINCE JOHN,
10582,PRINCE JOHN,"Six days hence, if you keep watch"
10583,PRINCE JOHN,At yonder window (you'll be hungry then)
10584,PRINCE JOHN,You may catch sight of Marian and Prince John
10585,PRINCE JOHN,Wandering into the gardens down below.
10586,PRINCE JOHN,You will be hungry then; perhaps you'll strive
10587,PRINCE JOHN,"To call to us, or stretch a meagre arm"
10588,PRINCE JOHN,Through those strong bars; but then you know the height
10589,PRINCE JOHN,Is very great--no voice can reach to the earth:
10590,PRINCE JOHN,This is the topmost cell in my Dark Tower.
10591,PRINCE JOHN,Men look like ants below there. I shall say
10592,PRINCE JOHN,"To Marian, See that creature waving there"
10593,PRINCE JOHN,"High up above us, level with the clouds,"
10594,PRINCE JOHN,Is it not like a winter-shrivelled fly?
10595,PRINCE JOHN,And she will laugh; and I will pluck her roses.
10596,PRINCE JOHN,"And then--and then--there are a hundred ways,"
10597,PRINCE JOHN,"You know, to touch a woman's blood with thoughts"
10598,PRINCE JOHN,Beyond its lawful limits. Ha! ha! ha!
10599,PRINCE JOHN,"By God, you almost spoke to me, I think."
10600,PRINCE JOHN,"Touches at twilight, whispers in the dark,"
10601,PRINCE JOHN,Sweet sympathetic murmurs o'er the loss
10602,PRINCE JOHN,"Of her so thoughtless Robin, do you think"
10603,PRINCE JOHN,Maid Marian will be quite so hard to win
10604,PRINCE JOHN,When princes come to woo? There will be none
10605,PRINCE JOHN,To interrupt us then. Time will be mine
10606,PRINCE JOHN,"To practise all the amorous arts of Ovid,"
10607,PRINCE JOHN,"And, at the last--"
10608,PRINCE JOHN,
10609,ROBIN,ROBIN
10610,ROBIN,Will you not free my hands?
10611,ROBIN,You have your sword. But I would like to fight you
10612,ROBIN,"Here, with my naked hands. I want no more."
10613,ROBIN,
10614,PRINCE JOHN,PRINCE JOHN
10615,PRINCE JOHN,
10616,PRINCE JOHN,Ha! ha! At last the sullen speaks.
10617,PRINCE JOHN,That's all
10618,PRINCE JOHN,I wanted. I have struck you in the face.
10619,PRINCE JOHN,Is't not enough? You can't repay that blow.
10620,PRINCE JOHN,
10621,ROBIN,ROBIN
10622,ROBIN,
10623,ROBIN,"Bury, me down in hell and I'll repay it"
10624,ROBIN,"The day you die, across your lying mouth"
10625,ROBIN,"That spoke of my true lady, I will repay it,"
10626,ROBIN,Before the face of God!
10627,ROBIN,
10628,PRINCE JOHN,PRINCE JOHN
10629,PRINCE JOHN,
10630,PRINCE JOHN,[_Laughing._]
10631,PRINCE JOHN,
10632,PRINCE JOHN,"Meanwhile, for me"
10633,PRINCE JOHN,"Till you repay that blow, there is the mouth"
10634,PRINCE JOHN,"Of Marian, the sweet honey-making mouth"
10635,PRINCE JOHN,That shall forestall your phantom blow with balm.
10636,PRINCE JOHN,"Oh, you'll go mad too soon if I delay."
10637,PRINCE JOHN,"I am glad you spoke. Farewell, the masons wait."
10638,PRINCE JOHN,And I must not be late for Marian.
10639,PRINCE JOHN,
10640,PRINCE JOHN,[_Exit thro' the small aperture now left in the doorway. It
10641,PRINCE JOHN,is rapidly closed and sounds of heavy masonry being
10642,PRINCE JOHN,piled against it are heard. ROBIN tries to free his
10643,PRINCE JOHN,"hands and after an effort, succeeds. He hurls himself"
10644,PRINCE JOHN,"against the doorway, and finds it hopeless. He"
10645,PRINCE JOHN,"turns to the window, peers through it for a moment, then"
10646,PRINCE JOHN,"suddenly unwinds a scarf from his neck, ties it to one"
10647,PRINCE JOHN,of the bars and stands to one side._]
10648,PRINCE JOHN,
10649,ROBIN,ROBIN
10650,ROBIN,Too high a shot for most of my good bowmen!
10651,ROBIN,What's that? A miss?
10652,ROBIN,
10653,ROBIN,[_He looks thro' the window._]
10654,ROBIN,
10655,ROBIN,"Good lad, he'll try again!"
10656,ROBIN,
10657,ROBIN,[_He stands at the side once more and an arrow comes thro' the
10658,ROBIN,window._]
10659,ROBIN,
10660,ROBIN,"Why, that's like magic!"
10661,ROBIN,
10662,ROBIN,[_He pulls up the thread attached to it._]
10663,ROBIN,
10664,ROBIN,"Softly, or 'twill break!--"
10665,ROBIN,"Ah, now 'tis sturdy cord."
10666,ROBIN,--I'll make it fast.
10667,ROBIN,"But, how to break these bars!"
10668,ROBIN,"St. Nicholas,"
10669,ROBIN,There's someone climbing. He must have a head
10670,ROBIN,"Of iron, and the lightness of a cat!"
10671,ROBIN,"Downward is bad enough, but up is more"
10672,ROBIN,Than mortal! Who the devil can it be?
10673,ROBIN,"Thank God, it's growing dark. But what a risk!"
10674,ROBIN,None of my merry men could e'en attempt it.
10675,ROBIN,I'm very sure it can't be Little John.
10676,ROBIN,"What, Shadow-of-a-Leaf!"
10677,ROBIN,
10678,ROBIN,[_SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF appears at the window._]
10679,ROBIN,
10680,ROBIN,"'Fore God, dear faithful fool,"
10681,ROBIN,I am glad to see you.

10683,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF
10684,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,
10685,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"Softly, gossip, softly,"
10686,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,Pull up the rope a little until we break
10687,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,This bar away--or some kind friend may see
10688,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"The dangling end below. Now here's a toothpick,"
10689,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"Six inches of grey steel, for you to work with,"
10690,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,And here's another for me. Pick out the mortar!
10691,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,
10692,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,[_They work to loosen the bars._]
10693,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,
10694,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,Wait! Here's a rose I brought you in my cap
10695,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,And here's a spray of fern! Old Nature's keys
10696,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"Open all prisons, I'll throw them in for luck,"
10697,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,
10698,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,[_He throws them into the cell and begins working feverishly again._]
10699,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,
10700,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,So that the princes of the world may know
10701,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"The forest let you out. Down there on earth,"
10702,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"If any sees me, they will only think"
10703,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,The creepers are in leaf. Pick out the mortar!
10704,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"That's how the greenwood works. You know, 'twill thrust"
10705,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,Its tendrils through these big grey stones one day
10706,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,And pull them down. I noticed in the courtyard
10707,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,The grass is creeping though the crevices
10708,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"Already, and yellow dandelions crouch"
10709,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,In all the crumbling corners. Pick it out!
10710,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,This is a very righteous work indeed
10711,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,For men in Lincoln green; for what are we
10712,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"But tendrils of old Nature, herald sprays!"
10713,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,We scarce anticipate. Pick the mortar out.
10714,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"Quick, there's no time to lose, although to-night"
10715,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,We're in advance of sun and moon and stars
10716,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,And all the tackling sands in Time's turned glass.
10717,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,
10718,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,[_With a sudden cry._]
10719,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,

10727,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,
10728,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"Ah, dead! Come, pick the mortar out,"
10729,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,Out of the walls of towers and shrines and tombs!
10730,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"For now Prince John is King, and Lady Marian"
10731,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"In peril, gossip! Yet we are in advance"
10732,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"Of sun and moon to-night, for sweet Prince John"
10733,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"Is not aware yet of his kinglihood,"
10734,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,Or of his brother's death.

10738,ROBIN,[_Pausing a moment._]
10739,ROBIN,
10740,ROBIN,"Why, Shadow-of-a-Leaf,"
10741,ROBIN,What does this mean?

10743,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF
10744,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,
10745,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"Come, pick the mortar out;"
10746,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,You have no time to lose. This very night
10747,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,My Lady Marian must away to Sherwood.
10748,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,At any moment the dread word may come
10749,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"That makes John King of England. Quick, be quick!"

10755,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF
10756,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,
10757,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,Then you must mask
10758,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"And fetch her thence! Ah, ha, the bar works loose."
10759,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,Pull it!
10760,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,
10761,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"[_They pull at the bar, get it free, and throw it into the cell._]"
10762,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,
10763,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"Now, master, follow me down the rope."

10768,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,"SCENE IV. _Night. The garden of the King's palace (as before), but"
10769,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,lighted with torches for the masque. Music swells up and dies away
10770,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,continually. Maskers pass to and fro between the palace and the garden.
10771,SHADOW-OF-A-LEAF,On the broad terrace in front some of them are dancing a galliard._

10796,PRINCE JOHN,There's the young knight you've lately made your own.
10797,PRINCE JOHN,"Where is my Lady Marian? Ah, I see her!"
10798,PRINCE JOHN,"With that old hypocrite, Fitzwalter."

11813,NOVICE,He must be a good man--this Robin Hood!
11814,NOVICE,I long to see him. Father used to say
11815,NOVICE,England had known none like him since the days
11816,NOVICE,Of Hereward the Wake.

11818,PRIORESS,PRIORESS
11819,PRIORESS,
11820,PRIORESS,He will be here
11821,PRIORESS,By vespers. You shall let him in. Who's that?
11822,PRIORESS,Can that be he? It is not sundown yet.
11823,PRIORESS,See who is there.

11827,NOVICE,NOVICE
11828,NOVICE,
11829,NOVICE,A lady asks to see you!
11830,NOVICE,She is robed like any nun and yet she spoke
11831,NOVICE,Like a great lady--one that is used to rule
11832,NOVICE,More than obey; and on her breast I saw
11833,NOVICE,A ruby smouldering like a secret fire
11834,NOVICE,Beneath her cloak. She bade me say she came
11835,NOVICE,On Robin Hood's behest.
11836,NOVICE,
11837,PRIORESS,PRIORESS
11838,PRIORESS,
11839,PRIORESS,What? Bring her in

11846,ELINOR,
11847,ELINOR,"Madam, I come to beg a favour."
11848,ELINOR,I am a friend of Robin Hood. I have heard--
11849,ELINOR,"One of his Foresters, this very noon"
11850,ELINOR,Brought me the news--that he is sorely wounded;
11851,ELINOR,And purposes to seek your kindly help
11852,ELINOR,At Kirklee Priory.

11854,PRIORESS,PRIORESS
11855,PRIORESS,
11856,PRIORESS,"Oh, then indeed,"
11857,PRIORESS,"You must be a great friend, for this was kept"
11858,PRIORESS,Most secret from all others.
11859,PRIORESS,
11860,ELINOR,ELINOR
11861,ELINOR,
11862,ELINOR,A great friend!
11863,ELINOR,"He was my page some fifteen years ago,"
11864,ELINOR,And all his life I have watched over him
11865,ELINOR,As if he were my son! I have come to beg
11866,ELINOR,A favour--let me see him when he comes.
11867,ELINOR,"My husband was a soldier, and I am skilled"
11868,ELINOR,In wounds. In Palestine I saved his life
11869,ELINOR,"When every leech despaired of it, a wound"
11870,ELINOR,Caused by a poisoned arrow.
11871,ELINOR,
11872,PRIORESS,PRIORESS
11873,PRIORESS,
11874,PRIORESS,You shall see him.
11875,PRIORESS,"I have some skill myself in balms and simples,"
11876,PRIORESS,"But, in these deadlier matters I would fain"
11877,PRIORESS,Trust to your wider knowledge.
11878,PRIORESS,
11879,ELINOR,ELINOR
11880,ELINOR,
11881,ELINOR,Let me see him alone;
11882,ELINOR,"Alone, you understand. His mind is fevered."
11883,ELINOR,I have an influence over him. Do not say
11884,ELINOR,"That I am here, or aught that will excite him."
11885,ELINOR,"Better say nothing--lead him gently in,"
11886,ELINOR,And leave him. In my hands he is like a child.
11887,ELINOR,
11888,PRIORESS,PRIORESS
11889,PRIORESS,
11890,PRIORESS,It shall be done. I see you are subtly versed
11891,PRIORESS,In the poor workings of our mortal minds.

11893,ELINOR,ELINOR
11894,ELINOR,

11918,PRIORESS,"Ah, no;"
11919,PRIORESS,"I am most glad to hear you say it, most glad"
11920,PRIORESS,To know we think alike. That is most true--
11921,PRIORESS,"Yes--yes--most true; for God alone, dear friend,"
11922,PRIORESS,Can raise the dead!
11923,PRIORESS,
11924,PRIORESS,[_A bell begins tolling slowly._]

11992,ELINOR,"As if I were a leper. Ah, come back."
11993,ELINOR,Are you so unforgiving? God forgives!
11994,ELINOR,Did you not see me praying for your sake?
11995,ELINOR,"Think, if you think not of yourself, oh, think"

12683,II,Then swaggered down as if he owned a world
12684,II,Which had forgotten--did I wake or dream?--
12685,II,Even his gracious ghost!
12686,II,
12687,II,Over his arm
12688,II,He swung a gorgeous murrey-coloured cloak
12689,II,"Of Ciprus velvet, caked and smeared with mud"
12690,II,As on the day when--did I dream or wake?
12691,II,And had not all this happened once before?--
12692,II,When he had laid that cloak before the feet
12693,II,"Of Gloriana! By that mud-stained cloak,"
12694,II,'Twas he! Our Ocean-Shepherd! Walter Raleigh!
12695,II,"He brushed me passing, and with one vigorous thrust"
12696,II,Opened the door and entered. At his heels
12697,II,I followed--into the Mermaid!--through three yards
12698,II,"Of pitch-black gloom, then into an old inn-parlour"
12699,II,Swimming with faces in a mist of smoke
12700,II,"That up-curled, blue, from long Winchester pipes,"
12701,II,"While--like some rare old picture, in a dream"
12702,II,"Recalled--quietly listening, laughing, watching,"
12703,II,Pale on that old black oaken wainscot floated
12704,II,"One bearded oval face, young, with deep eyes,"
12705,II,"Whom Raleigh hailed as ""Will!"""
12706,II,
12707,II,But as I stared
12708,II,A sudden buffet from a brawny hand
12709,II,"Made all my senses swim, and the room rang"
12710,II,With laughter as upon the rush-strewn floor
12711,II,My feet slipped and I fell. Then a gruff voice
12712,II,"Growled over me--""Get up now, John-a-dreams,"
12713,II,Or else mine host must find another drawer!
12714,II,"Hast thou not heard us calling all this while?"""
12715,II,"And, as I scrambled up, the rafters rang"
12716,II,"With cries of ""Sack! Bring me a cup of sack!"
12717,II,"Canary! Sack! Malmsey! and Muscadel!"""
12718,II,"I understood and flew. I was awake,"
12719,II,"A leather-jerkined pot-boy to these gods,"
12720,II,A prentice Ganymede to the Mermaid Inn!
12721,II,
12722,II,"There, flitting to and fro with cups of wine,"
12723,II,I heard them toss the Chrysomelan names
12724,II,"From mouth to mouth--Lyly and Peele and Lodge,"
12725,II,"Kit Marlowe, Michael Drayton, and the rest,"
12726,II,"With Ben, rare Ben, brick-layer Ben, who rolled"
12727,II,Like a great galleon on his ingle-bench.
12728,II,Some twenty years of age he seemed; and yet
12729,II,"This young Gargantua with the bull-dog jaws,"
12730,II,"The T, for Tyburn, branded on his thumb,"
12731,II,"And grim pock-pitted face, was growling tales"
12732,II,To Dekker that would fright a buccaneer.--
12733,II,How in the fierce Low Countries he had killed
12734,II,"His man, and won that scar on his bronzed fist;"
12735,II,"Was taken prisoner, and turned Catholick;"
12736,II,"And, now returned to London, was resolved"
12737,II,To blast away the vapours of the town
12738,II,With Boreas-throated plays of thunderous mirth.
12739,II,"""I'll thwack their Tribulation-Wholesomes, lad,"
12740,II,"Their Yellow-faced Envies and lean Thorns-i'-the-Flesh,"
12741,II,"At the _Black-friars Theatre_, or _The Rose_,"
12742,II,"Or else _The Curtain_. Failing these, I'll find"
12743,II,"Some good square inn-yard with wide galleries,"
12744,II,And windows level with the stage. 'Twill serve
12745,II,"My Comedy of Vapours; though, I grant."
12746,II,"For Tragedy a private House is best,"
12747,II,"Or, just as Burbage tip-toes to a deed"
12748,II,"Of blood, or, over your stable's black half-door,"
12749,II,"Marked _Battlements_ in white chalk, your breathless David"
12750,II,"Glowers at the whiter Bathsheba within,"
12751,II,Some humorous coach-horse neighs a 'hallelujah'!
12752,II,And the pit splits its doublets. Over goes
12753,II,"The whole damned apple-barrel, and the yard"
12754,II,"Is all one rough and tumble, scramble and scratch"
12755,II,"Of prentices, green madams, and cut-purses"
12756,II,For half-chewed Norfolk pippins. Never mind!
12757,II,We'll build the perfect stage in Shoreditch yet.
12758,II,"And Will, there, hath half promised I shall write"
12759,II,A piece for his own company! What d'ye think
12760,II,"Of _Venus and Adonis_, his first heir,"
12761,II,"Printed last week? A bouncing boy, my lad!"
12762,II,And he's at work on a Midsummer's Dream
12763,II,"That turns the world to fairyland!"""
12764,II,
12765,II,All these
12766,II,"And many more were there, and all were young!"
12767,II,"There, as I brimmed their cups, I heard the voice"
12768,II,"Of Raleigh ringing across the smoke-wreathed room,--"
12769,II,"""Ben, could you put a frigate on the stage,"
12770,II,I've found a tragedy for you. Have you heard
12771,II,"The true tale of Sir Humphrey Gilbert?"""
12772,II,
12773,II,"""No!"""
12774,II,
12775,II,"""Why, Ben, of all the tragical affairs"
12776,II,"Of the Ocean-sea, and of that other Ocean"
12777,II,"Where all men sail so blindly, and misjudge"
12778,II,"Their friends, their charts, their storms, their stars, their God,"
12779,II,If there be truth in the blind crowder's song
12780,II,"I bought in Bread Street for a penny, this"
12781,II,Is the brief type and chronicle of them all.
12782,II,"Listen!"" Then Raleigh sent these rugged rhymes"
12783,II,Of some blind crowder rolling in great waves
12784,II,Of passion across the gloom. At each refrain
12785,II,"He sank his voice to a broad deep undertone,"
12786,II,As if the distant roar of breaking surf
12787,II,Or the low thunder of eternal tides
12788,II,"Filled up the pauses of the nearer storm,"
12789,II,"Storm against storm, a soul against the sea:--"

12795,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,"Knight-in-chief of the Ocean-sea,"
12796,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,Gazed from the rocks of his New Found Land
12797,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,And thought of the home where his heart would be.
12798,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,
12799,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,He gazed across the wintry waste
12800,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,"That weltered and hissed like molten lead,--"
12801,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,"""He saileth twice who saileth in haste!"
12802,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,"I'll wait the favour of Spring,"" he said."

12808,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,The yellow clots of foam went by
12809,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,"Like shavings that curl from a ship-wright's plane,"
12810,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,"Clinging and flying, afar and nigh,"
12811,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,"Shuddering, flying and clinging again."
12812,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,
12813,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,A thousand bubbles in every one
12814,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,Shifted and shimmered with rainbow gleams;
12815,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,But--had they been planets and stars that spun
12816,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,He had let them drift by his feet like dreams:
12817,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,
12818,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,"Heavy of heart was our Admirall,"
12819,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,"For, out of his ships--and they were but three!--"
12820,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,"He had lost the fairest and most tall,"
12821,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,And--he was a Knight of the Ocean-sea.
12822,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,
12823,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,"_Ever the more, ever the more,"

12826,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,
12827,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,"Heavy of heart, heavy of heart,"
12828,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,"For she was a galleon mighty as May,"
12829,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,And the storm that ripped her glory apart
12830,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,Had stripped his soul for the winter's way;
12831,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,
12832,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,And he was aware of a whisper blown
12833,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,"From foc'sle to poop, from windward to lee,"
12834,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,"That the fault was his, and his alone,"
12835,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,And--he was a Knight of the Ocean-sea.

12837,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,"""Had he done that! Had he done this!"""

12840,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,And the foam hides more than the deep can tell.
12841,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,
12842,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,"And the deep had buried his best-loved books,"
12843,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,With many a hard-worn chart and plan:

12864,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,That they must be taken at their own word.
12865,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,
12866,A KNIGHT OF THE OCEAN-SEA,For the great grim waves were as molten lead

13427,XIII,"And sealing-wax! Be quick. The rogue shall eat it,"
13428,XIII,"And then I'll seal his lips."""
13429,XIII,"""No--not to-night,"""
13430,XIII,"Kit whispered, laughing, ""I've a prettier plan"
13431,XIII,"For Master Bame."""
13432,XIII,"""As for that scrap of paper,"""
13433,XIII,"The voice of Shakespeare quietly resumed,"
13434,XIII,"""Why, which of us could send his heart and soul"
13435,XIII,Thro' Caxton's printing-press and hope to find
13436,XIII,The pretty pair unmangled. I'll not trust
13437,XIII,"The spoken word, no, not of my own lips,"
13438,XIII,Before the Judgment Throne against myself
13439,XIII,Or on my own defence; and I'll not trust
13440,XIII,The printed word to mirror Robert Greene.
13441,XIII,"See--here's another Testament, in blood,"
13442,XIII,"Written, not printed, for the Mermaid Inn."
13443,XIII,Rob sent it from his death-bed straight to me.
13444,XIII,Read it. 'Tis for the Mermaid Inn alone;
13445,XIII,"And when 'tis read, we'll burn it, as he asks."""
13446,XIII,
13447,XIII,"Then, from the hands of Shakespeare, Marlowe took"
13448,XIII,"A little scroll, and, while the winds without"
13449,XIII,Rattled the shutters with their ghostly hands
13450,XIII,"And wailed among the chimney-tops, he read:--"
13451,XIII,
13452,XIII,Greeting to all the Mermaid Inn
13453,XIII,"From their old Vice and Slip of Sin,"
13454,XIII,"Greeting, Ben, to you, and you"
13455,XIII,"Will Shakespeare and Kit Marlowe, too."
13456,XIII,"Greeting from your Might-have-been,"
13457,XIII,"Your broken sapling, Robert Greene."
13458,XIII,
13459,XIII,"Read my letter--'Tis my last,"
13460,XIII,"Then let Memory blot me out,"
13461,XIII,I would not make my maudlin past
13462,XIII,A trough for every swinish snout.
13463,XIII,
13464,XIII,"First, I leave a debt unpaid,"
13465,XIII,"It's all chalked up, not much all told,"
13466,XIII,"For Bread and Sack. When I am cold,"
13467,XIII,Doll can pawn my Spanish blade
13468,XIII,And pay mine host. She'll pay mine'host!
13469,XIII,But ... I have chalked up other scores
13470,XIII,"In your own hearts, behind the doors,"
13471,XIII,"Not to be paid so quickly. Yet,"
13472,XIII,"O, if you would not have my ghost"
13473,XIII,"Creeping in at dead of night,"
13474,XIII,"Out of the cold wind, out of the wet,"
13475,XIII,With weeping face and helpless fingers
13476,XIII,"Trying to wipe the marks away,"
13477,XIII,"Read what I can write, still write,"
13478,XIII,While this life within them lingers.
13479,XIII,"Let me pay, lads, let me pay."
13480,XIII,
13481,XIII,"_Item_, for a peacock phrase,"
13482,XIII,"Flung out in a sudden blaze,"
13483,XIII,"Flung out at his friend Shake-scene,"
13484,XIII,"By this ragged Might-have-been,"
13485,XIII,"This poor Jackdaw, Robert Greene."
13486,XIII,
13487,XIII,"Will, I knew it all the while!"
13488,XIII,And you know it--and you smile!
13489,XIII,"My quill was but a Jackdaw's feather,"
13490,XIII,"While the quill that Ben, there, wields,"
13491,XIII,"Fluttered down thro' azure fields,"
13492,XIII,From an eagle in the sun;
13493,XIII,"And yours, Will, yours, no earth-born thing,"
13494,XIII,"A plume of rainbow-tinctured grain,"
13495,XIII,Dropt out of an angel's wing.
13496,XIII,"Only a Jackdaw's feather mine,"
13497,XIII,"And mine ran ink, and Ben's ran wine,"
13498,XIII,And yours the pure Pierian streams.
13499,XIII,
13500,XIII,"But I had dreams, O, I had dreams!"
13501,XIII,"Dreams, you understand me, Will;"
13502,XIII,And I fretted at the tether
13503,XIII,"That bound me to the lowly plain,"
13504,XIII,"Gnawed my heart out, for I knew"
13505,XIII,"Once, tho' that was long ago,"
13506,XIII,I might have risen with Ben and you
13507,XIII,Somewhere near that Holy Hill
13508,XIII,Whence the living rivers flow.
13509,XIII,Let it pass. I did not know
13510,XIII,One bitter phrase could ever fly
13511,XIII,So far through that immortal sky
13512,XIII,--Seeing all my songs had flown so low--
13513,XIII,One envious phrase that cannot die
13514,XIII,From century to century.
13515,XIII,
13516,XIII,"Kit Marlowe ceased a moment, and the wind,"
13517,XIII,"As if indeed the night were all one ghost,"
13518,XIII,"Wailed round the Mermaid Inn, then sent once more"
13519,XIII,Its desolate passion through the reader's voice:--
13520,XIII,
13521,XIII,Some truth there was in what I said.
13522,XIII,Kit Marlowe taught you half your trade;
13523,XIII,And something of the rest you learned
13524,XIII,"From me,--but all you took you earned."
13525,XIII,"You took the best I had to give,"
13526,XIII,You took my clay and made it live;
13527,XIII,And that--why that's what God must do!--
13528,XIII,My music made for mortal ears
13529,XIII,You flung to all the listening spheres.
13530,XIII,You took my dreams and made them true.
13531,XIII,"And, if I claimed them, the blank air"
13532,XIII,Might claim the breath I shape to prayer.
13533,XIII,I do not claim it! Let the earth
13534,XIII,Claim the thrones she brings to birth.
13535,XIII,Let the first shapers of our tongue
13536,XIII,"Claim whate'er is said or sung,"
13537,XIII,Till the doom repeal that debt
13538,XIII,And cancel the first alphabet.
13539,XIII,"Yet when, like a god, you scaled"
13540,XIII,The shining crags where my foot failed;
13541,XIII,When I saw my fruit of the vine
13542,XIII,"Foam in the Olympian cup,"
13543,XIII,Or in that broader chalice shine
13544,XIII,"Blood-red, a sacramental drink,"
13545,XIII,"With stars for bubbles, lifted up,"
13546,XIII,"Through the universal night,"
13547,XIII,"Up to the celestial brink,"
13548,XIII,Up to that quintessential Light
13549,XIII,Where God acclaimed you for the wine
13550,XIII,Crushed from those poor grapes of mine;
13551,XIII,"O, you'll understand, no doubt,"
13552,XIII,"How the poor vine-dresser fell,"
13553,XIII,How a pin-prick can let out
13554,XIII,"All the bannered hosts of hell,"
13555,XIII,"Nay, a knife-thrust, the sharp truth--"
13556,XIII,"I had spilt my wine of youth,"
13557,XIII,The Temple was not mine to build.
13558,XIII,My place in the world's march was filled.
13559,XIII,
13560,XIII,Yet--through all the years to come--
13561,XIII,Men to whom my songs are dumb
13562,XIII,Will remember them and me
13563,XIII,"For that one cry of jealousy,"
13564,XIII,"That curse where I had come to bless,"
13565,XIII,That harsh voice of unhappiness.
13566,XIII,"They'll note the curse, but not the pang,"
13567,XIII,"Not the torment whence it sprang,"
13568,XIII,"They'll note the blow at my friend's back,"
13569,XIII,But not the soul stretched on the rack.
13570,XIII,"They'll note the weak convulsive sting,"
13571,XIII,Not the crushed body and broken wing.
13572,XIII,
13573,XIII,"_Item_, for my thirty years,"
13574,XIII,"Dashed with sun and splashed with tears,"
13575,XIII,"Wan with revel, red with wine,"
13576,XIII,This Jack-o-lanthorn life of mine.
13577,XIII,"Other wiser, happier men,"
13578,XIII,"Take the full three-score-and-ten,"
13579,XIII,"Climb slow, and seek the sun."
13580,XIII,Dancing down is soon done.
13581,XIII,"Golden boys, beware, beware,--"
13582,XIII,The ambiguous oracles declare
13583,XIII,Loving gods for those that die
13584,XIII,"Young, as old men may; but I,"
13585,XIII,"Quick as was my pilgrimage,"
13586,XIII,Wither in mine April age.
13587,XIII,
13588,XIII,"_Item_, one groatsworth of wit,"
13589,XIII,"Bought at an exceeding price,"
13590,XIII,"Ay, a million of repentance."
13591,XIII,Let me pay the whole of it.
13592,XIII,"Lying here these deadly nights,"
13593,XIII,"Lads, for me the Mermaid lights"
13594,XIII,Gleam as for a castaway
13595,XIII,Swept along a midnight sea
13596,XIII,"The harbour-lanthorns, each a spark,"
13597,XIII,"A pin-prick in the solid dark,"
13598,XIII,That lets trickle through a ray
13599,XIII,"Glorious out of Paradise,"
13600,XIII,To stab him with new agony.
13601,XIII,"Let me pay, lads, let me pay!"
13602,XIII,Let the Mermaid pass the sentence:
13603,XIII,"I am pleading guilty now,"
13604,XIII,"A dead leaf on the laurel-bough,"
13605,XIII,And the storm whirls me away.
13606,XIII,
13607,XIII,Kit Marlowe ceased; but not the wailing wind
13608,XIII,That round and round the silent Mermaid Inn
13609,XIII,"Wandered, with helpless fingers trying the doors,"
13610,XIII,Like a most desolate ghost.
13611,XIII,
13612,XIII,A sudden throng
13613,XIII,"Of players bustled in, shaking the rain"
13614,XIII,"From their plumed hats. ""Veracious witnesses,"""
13615,XIII,"The snuffle of Bame arose anew, ""declare"
13616,XIII,"It was a surfeit killed him, Rhenish wine"
13617,XIII,And pickled herrings. His shirt was very foul.
13618,XIII,"He had but one. His doublet, too, was frayed,"
13619,XIII,"And his boots broken ..."""
13620,XIII,
13621,XIII,"""What! Gonzago, you!"""
13622,XIII,A short fat player called in a deep voice
13623,XIII,"Across the room and, throwing aside his cloak"
13624,XIII,"To show the woman's robe he wore beneath,"
13625,XIII,"Minced up to Bame and bellowed--""'Tis such men"
13626,XIII,"As you that tempt us women to our fall!"""
13627,XIII,"And all the throng of players rocked and roared,"
13628,XIII,Till at a nod and wink from Kit a hush
13629,XIII,Held them again.
13630,XIII,
13631,XIII,"""Look to the door,"" he said,"
13632,XIII,"""Is any listening?"" The young player crept,"
13633,XIII,"A mask of mystery, to the door and peeped."
13634,XIII,"""All's well! The coast is clear!"""
13635,XIII,"""Then shall we tell"
13636,XIII,"Our plan to Master Bame?"""
13637,XIII,Round the hushed room
13638,XIII,"Went Kit, a pen and paper in his hand,"
13639,XIII,"Whispering each to read, digest, and sign,"
13640,XIII,While Ben re-filled the glass of Master Bame.
13641,XIII,"""And now,"" said Kit aloud, ""what think you, lads?"
13642,XIII,"Shall he be told?"" Solemnly one or two"
13643,XIII,"'Gan shake their heads with ""Safety! safety! Kit!"""
13644,XIII,"""O, Bame can keep a secret! Come, we'll tell him!"
13645,XIII,He can advise us how a righteous man
13646,XIII,Should act! We'll let him share an he approve.
13647,XIII,"Now, Master Bame,--come closer--my good friend,"
13648,XIII,"Ben Jonson here, hath lately found a way"
13649,XIII,"Of--hush! Come closer!--coining money, Bame."""
13650,XIII,"""Coining!"" ""Ay, hush, now! Hearken! A certain sure"
13651,XIII,"And indiscoverable method, sir!"
13652,XIII,"He is acquainted with one Poole, a felon"
13653,XIII,"Lately released from Newgate, hath great skill"
13654,XIII,"In mixture of metals--hush!--and, by the help"
13655,XIII,"Of a right cunning maker of stamps, we mean"
13656,XIII,"To coin French crowns, rose-nobles, pistolettes,"
13657,XIII,"Angels and English shillings."""
13658,XIII,For one breath
13659,XIII,"Bame stared at him with bulging beetle-eyes,"
13660,XIII,Then murmured shyly as a country maid
13661,XIII,"In her first wooing, ""Is't not against the law?"""
13662,XIII,"""Why, sir, who makes the law? Why should not Bame"
13663,XIII,Coin his own crowns like Queen Elizabeth?
13664,XIII,"She is but mortal! And consider, too,"
13665,XIII,"The good works it should prosper in your hands,"
13666,XIII,Without regard to red-deer pies and wine
13667,XIII,"White as the Milky Way. Such secrets, Bame,"
13668,XIII,Were not good for the general; but a few
13669,XIII,"Discreet and righteous palms, your own, my friend,"
13670,XIII,"And mine,--what think you?"""
13671,XIII,With a hesitant glance
13672,XIII,"Of well-nigh child-like cunning, screwing his eyes,"
13673,XIII,Bame laughed a little huskily and looked round
13674,XIII,"At that grave ring of anxious faces, all"
13675,XIII,Holding their breath and thrilling his blunt nerves
13676,XIII,"With their stage-practice. ""And no risk?"" breathed Bame,"
13677,XIII,"""No risk at all?"" ""O, sir, no risk at all!"
13678,XIII,"We make the very coins. Besides, that part"
13679,XIII,"Touches not you. Yours is the honest face,"
13680,XIII,"That's all we want."""
13681,XIII,"""Why, sir, if you be sure"
13682,XIII,"There is no risk ..."""
13683,XIII,"""You'll help to spend it. Good!"
13684,XIII,"We'll talk anon of this, and you shall carry"
13685,XIII,"More angels in your pocket, master Bame,"
13686,XIII,Than e'er you'll meet in heaven. Set hand on seal
13687,XIII,"To this now, master Bame, to prove your faith."
13688,XIII,"Come, all have signed it. Here's the quill, dip, write."
13689,XIII,"Good!"""
13690,XIII,"And Kit, pocketing the paper, bowed"
13691,XIII,"The gull to the inn-door, saying as he went,--"
13692,XIII,"""You shall hear further when the plan's complete."
13693,XIII,"But there's one great condition--not one word,"
13694,XIII,One breath of scandal more on Robert Greene.
13695,XIII,He's dead; but he was one of us. The day
13696,XIII,"You air his shirt, I air this paper, too."""
13697,XIII,"No gleam of understanding, even then,"
13698,XIII,"Illumed that long white face: no stage, indeed,"
13699,XIII,Has known such acting as the Mermaid Inn
13700,XIII,"That night, and Bame but sniggered, ""Why, of course,"
13701,XIII,There's good in all men; and the best of us
13702,XIII,"Will make mistakes."""
13703,XIII,"""But no mistakes in this,"""
13704,XIII,"Said Kit, ""or all together we shall swing"
13705,XIII,At Tyburn--who knows what may leap to light?--
13706,XIII,"You understand? No scandal!"" ""Not a breath!"""
13707,XIII,"So, in dead silence, Master Richard Bame"
13708,XIII,"Went out into the darkness and the night,"
13709,XIII,"To ask, as I have heard, for many a moon,"
13710,XIII,"The price of malmsey-butts and silken hose,"
13711,XIII,And doublets slashed with satin.
13712,XIII,As the door
13713,XIII,"Slammed on his back, the pent-up laughter burst"
13714,XIII,"With echo and re-echo round the room,"
13715,XIII,But ceased as Will tossed on the glowing hearth
13716,XIII,The last poor Testament of Robert Greene.
13717,XIII,All watched it burn. The black wind wailed and moaned
13718,XIII,Around the Mermaid as the sparks flew up.
13719,XIII,"""God, what a night for ships upon the sea,"""
13720,XIII,"Said Raleigh, peering through the wet black panes,"
13721,XIII,"""Well--we may thank Him for the Little Red Ring!"""
13722,XIII,"""_The Little Red Ring_,"" cried Kit, ""_the Little Red Ring!_"""
13723,XIII,Then up stood Dekker on the old black settle.
13724,XIII,"""Give it a thumping chorus, lads,"" he called,"
13725,XIII,And sang this brave song of the Mermaid Inn:--

13729,I,
13730,I,"Seven wise men on an old black settle,"

13732,I,"Ringing blades of the one right metal,"
13733,I,What is the best that a blade can win?
13734,I,"Bread and cheese, and a few small kisses?"
13735,I,Ha! ha! ha! Would you take them--you?
13736,I,"--Ay, if Dame Venus would add to her blisses"
13737,I,A roaring fire and a friend or two!
13738,I,
13739,I,"_Chorus:_ Up now, answer me, tell me true!--"
13740,I,"--Ay, if the hussy would add to her blisses"
13741,I,A roaring fire and a friend or two!

13747,II,"What, when the last wild midnight falls"
13748,II,"Dark, too dark for the bat to be flying"
13749,II,Round the ruins of old St. Paul's?
13750,II,What will be last of the lights to perish?
13751,II,"What but the little red ring we knew,"
13752,II,Lighting the hands and the hearts that cherish
13753,II,"A fire, a fire, and a friend or two!"
13754,II,
13755,II,"_Chorus:_ Up now, answer me, tell me true!"
13756,II,What will be last of the stars to perish?

13764,III,"Soberest man on the old black settle,"
13765,III,Out with the truth! It was never a sin.--

14178,CANTO THE SECOND,The Night-Wind or the Devil?
14179,CANTO THE SECOND,
14180,CANTO THE SECOND,_Chorus:_   No doubt at all--the Devil!
14181,CANTO THE SECOND,
14182,CANTO THE SECOND,"He stares, with naked knife in hand,"
14183,CANTO THE SECOND,This buccaneer in fairyland!
14184,CANTO THE SECOND,Dancing in a saraband
14185,CANTO THE SECOND,The red ferns reel about him!
14186,CANTO THE SECOND,Dancing in a morrice-ring
14187,CANTO THE SECOND,"The green ferns curtsey, kiss and cling!"
14188,CANTO THE SECOND,"Their Marians flirt, their Robins fling"
14189,CANTO THE SECOND,Their feathery heels to flout him!
14190,CANTO THE SECOND,
14191,CANTO THE SECOND,_Chorus:_   The whole wood reels about him.
14192,CANTO THE SECOND,
14193,CANTO THE SECOND,"Dance, ye shadows! O'er the glade,"
14194,CANTO THE SECOND,"Bill, the Bo'sun, undismayed,"
14195,CANTO THE SECOND,Pigeon-toes with glittering blade!
14196,CANTO THE SECOND,Drake was never bolder!
14197,CANTO THE SECOND,"Devil or Spaniard, what cares he"
14198,CANTO THE SECOND,Whence your eerie music be?
14199,CANTO THE SECOND,"Till--lo, against yon old oak-tree"
14200,CANTO THE SECOND,He leans his brawny shoulder!
14201,CANTO THE SECOND,
14202,CANTO THE SECOND,_Chorus:_   He lists and leans his shoulder!
14203,CANTO THE SECOND,
14204,CANTO THE SECOND,"Ah, what melody doth he hear"
14205,CANTO THE SECOND,As to that gnarled old tree-trunk there
14206,CANTO THE SECOND,"He lays his wind-bit brass-ringed ear,"
14207,CANTO THE SECOND,And steals his arm about it?
14208,CANTO THE SECOND,What Dryad could this Bo'sun win
14209,CANTO THE SECOND,To that slow-rippling amorous grin?--
14210,CANTO THE SECOND,'Twas full of singing bees within!
14211,CANTO THE SECOND,Not Didymus could doubt it!
14212,CANTO THE SECOND,
14213,CANTO THE SECOND,_Chorus:_   So loud they buzzed about it!
14214,CANTO THE SECOND,
14215,CANTO THE SECOND,"Straight, o'er a bough one leg he throws,"
14216,CANTO THE SECOND,And up that oaken main-mast goes
14217,CANTO THE SECOND,With reckless red unlarded nose
14218,CANTO THE SECOND,And gooseberry eyes of wonder!
14219,CANTO THE SECOND,"Till now, as in a galleon's hold,"
14220,CANTO THE SECOND,"Below, he sees great cells of gold"
14221,CANTO THE SECOND,Whence all the hollow trunk up-rolled
14222,CANTO THE SECOND,A low melodious thunder.
14223,CANTO THE SECOND,
14224,CANTO THE SECOND,_Chorus:_   A sweet and perilous thunder!
14225,CANTO THE SECOND,
14226,CANTO THE SECOND,"Ay, there, within that hollow tree,"
14227,CANTO THE SECOND,"Will Shakespeare, mightst thou truly see"
14228,CANTO THE SECOND,"The Imperial City of the Bee,"
14229,CANTO THE SECOND,In Chrysomelan splendour!
14230,CANTO THE SECOND,"And, in the midst, one eight-foot dome"
14231,CANTO THE SECOND,Swells o'er that Titan honey-comb
14232,CANTO THE SECOND,"Where the Bee-Empress hath her home,"
14233,CANTO THE SECOND,"With such as do attend her,"
14234,CANTO THE SECOND,
14235,CANTO THE SECOND,_Chorus:_   Weaponed with stings attend her!
14236,CANTO THE SECOND,
14237,CANTO THE SECOND,But now her singing sentinels
14238,CANTO THE SECOND,"Have turned to sleep in waxen cells,"
14239,CANTO THE SECOND,And Bill leans down his face and smells
14240,CANTO THE SECOND,The whole sweet summer's cargo--
14241,CANTO THE SECOND,"In one deep breath, the whole year's bloom,"
14242,CANTO THE SECOND,"Lily and thyme and rose and broom,"
14243,CANTO THE SECOND,One Golden Fleece of flower-perfume
14244,CANTO THE SECOND,In that old oaken Argo.
14245,CANTO THE SECOND,
14246,CANTO THE SECOND,_Chorus:_   That green and golden Argo!
14247,CANTO THE SECOND,
14248,CANTO THE SECOND,And now he hangs with dangling feet
14249,CANTO THE SECOND,"Over that dark abyss of sweet,"
14250,CANTO THE SECOND,Striving to reach such wild gold meat
14251,CANTO THE SECOND,As none could buy for money:
14252,CANTO THE SECOND,His left hand grips a swinging branch
14253,CANTO THE SECOND,"When--crack! Our Bo'sun, stout and stanch,"
14254,CANTO THE SECOND,"Falls like an Alpine avalanche,"
14255,CANTO THE SECOND,Feet first into the honey!
14256,CANTO THE SECOND,
14257,CANTO THE SECOND,_Chorus:_   Up to his ears in honey!
14258,CANTO THE SECOND,
14259,CANTO THE SECOND,And now his red unlarded nose
14260,CANTO THE SECOND,And bulging eyes are all that shows
14261,CANTO THE SECOND,"Above it, as he puffs and blows!"
14262,CANTO THE SECOND,And now--to 'scape the scathing
14263,CANTO THE SECOND,Of that black host of furious bees
14264,CANTO THE SECOND,His nose and eyes he fain would grease
14265,CANTO THE SECOND,And bobs below those golden seas
14266,CANTO THE SECOND,Like an old woman bathing.
14267,CANTO THE SECOND,
14268,CANTO THE SECOND,_Chorus:_   Old Mother Hubbard bathing!
14269,CANTO THE SECOND,
14270,CANTO THE SECOND,"And now he struggles, all in vain,"
14271,CANTO THE SECOND,To reach some little bough again;
14272,CANTO THE SECOND,"But, though he heaves with might and main,"
14273,CANTO THE SECOND,"This honey holds his ribs, sirs,"
14274,CANTO THE SECOND,"So tight, a barque might sooner try"
14275,CANTO THE SECOND,To steer a cargo through the sky
14276,CANTO THE SECOND,"Than Bill, thus honey-logged, to fly"
14277,CANTO THE SECOND,"By flopping of his jib, sirs!"
14278,CANTO THE SECOND,
14279,CANTO THE SECOND,"_Chorus:_   His tops'l and his jib, sirs!"
14280,CANTO THE SECOND,
14281,CANTO THE SECOND,Like Oberon in the hive his beard
14282,CANTO THE SECOND,With wax and honey all besmeared
14283,CANTO THE SECOND,Would make the crescent moon afeard
14284,CANTO THE SECOND,That now is sailing brightly
14285,CANTO THE SECOND,Right o'er his leafy donjon-keep!
14286,CANTO THE SECOND,"But that she knows him sunken deep,"
14287,CANTO THE SECOND,"And that his tower is straight and steep,"
14288,CANTO THE SECOND,She would not smile so lightly.
14289,CANTO THE SECOND,
14290,CANTO THE SECOND,_Chorus:_   Look down and smile so lightly.
14291,CANTO THE SECOND,
14292,CANTO THE SECOND,"She smiles in that small heavenly space,"
14293,CANTO THE SECOND,"Ringed with the tree-trunk's leafy grace,"
14294,CANTO THE SECOND,While upward grins his ghastly face
14295,CANTO THE SECOND,"As if some wild-wood Satyr,"
14296,CANTO THE SECOND,Some gnomish Ptolemy should dare
14297,CANTO THE SECOND,"Up that dark optic tube to stare,"
14298,CANTO THE SECOND,"As all unveiled she floated there,"
14299,CANTO THE SECOND,"Poor maiden moon, straight at her!"
14300,CANTO THE SECOND,
14301,CANTO THE SECOND,_Chorus:_   The buccaneering Satyr!
14302,CANTO THE SECOND,
14303,CANTO THE SECOND,"But there, till some one help him out,"
14304,CANTO THE SECOND,"Black Bill must stay, without a doubt."
14305,CANTO THE SECOND,"""_Help! Help!_"" he gives a muffled shout."
14306,CANTO THE SECOND,None but the white owls hear it!
14307,CANTO THE SECOND,"_Who? Whoo?_ they cry: Bill answers ""ME!"
14308,CANTO THE SECOND,_I am stuck fast in this great tree!
14309,CANTO THE SECOND,"Bring me a rope, good Timothy!"
14310,CANTO THE SECOND,"There's honey, lads, we'll share it!_"""
14311,CANTO THE SECOND,
14312,CANTO THE SECOND,"_Chorus:_   Ay, now he wants to share it."
14313,CANTO THE SECOND,
14314,CANTO THE SECOND,"Then, thinking help may come with morn,"
14315,CANTO THE SECOND,"He sinks, half-famished and out-worn,"
14316,CANTO THE SECOND,And scarce his nose exalts its horn
14317,CANTO THE SECOND,Above that sea of glory!
14318,CANTO THE SECOND,"But, even as he owns defeat,"
14319,CANTO THE SECOND,"His belly saith, ""A man must eat,"
14320,CANTO THE SECOND,"And since there is none other meat,"
14321,CANTO THE SECOND,"Come, lap this mess before 'ee!"""
14322,CANTO THE SECOND,
14323,CANTO THE SECOND,_Chorus:_   This glorious mess before 'ee.
14324,CANTO THE SECOND,
14325,CANTO THE SECOND,Then Dian sees a right strange sight
14326,CANTO THE SECOND,"As, bidding him a fond good-night,"
14327,CANTO THE SECOND,She flings a silvery kiss to light
14328,CANTO THE SECOND,"In that deep oak-tree hollow,"
14329,CANTO THE SECOND,And finds that gold and crimson nose
14330,CANTO THE SECOND,"A moving, munching, ravenous rose"
14331,CANTO THE SECOND,"That up and down unceasing goes,"
14332,CANTO THE SECOND,Save when he stops to swallow!
14333,CANTO THE SECOND,
14334,CANTO THE SECOND,_Chorus:_   He finds it hard to swallow!
14335,CANTO THE SECOND,
14336,CANTO THE SECOND,"Ay, now his best becomes his worst,"
14337,CANTO THE SECOND,"For honey cannot quench his thirst,"
14338,CANTO THE SECOND,Though he should eat until he burst;
14339,CANTO THE SECOND,"But, ah, the skies are kindly,"
14340,CANTO THE SECOND,And from their tender depths of blue
14341,CANTO THE SECOND,They send their silver-sliding dew.
14342,CANTO THE SECOND,So Bill thrusts out his tongue anew
14343,CANTO THE SECOND,And waits to catch it--blindly!
14344,CANTO THE SECOND,
14345,CANTO THE SECOND,"_Chorus:_   For ah, the stars are kindly!"
14346,CANTO THE SECOND,
14347,CANTO THE SECOND,"And sometimes, with a shower of rain,"
14348,CANTO THE SECOND,They strive to ease their prisoner's pain:
14349,CANTO THE SECOND,Then Bill thrusts out his tongue again
14350,CANTO THE SECOND,"With never a grace, the sinner!"
14351,CANTO THE SECOND,"And day and night and day goes by,"
14352,CANTO THE SECOND,"And never a comrade comes anigh,"
14353,CANTO THE SECOND,And still the honey swells as high
14354,CANTO THE SECOND,"For supper, breakfast, dinner!"
14355,CANTO THE SECOND,
14356,CANTO THE SECOND,_Chorus:_   Yet Bill has grown no thinner!
14357,CANTO THE SECOND,
14358,CANTO THE SECOND,The young moon grows to full and throws
14359,CANTO THE SECOND,"Her buxom kiss upon his nose,"
14360,CANTO THE SECOND,"As nightly over the tree she goes,"
14361,CANTO THE SECOND,"And peeps and smiles and passes,"
14362,CANTO THE SECOND,Then with her fickle silver flecks
14363,CANTO THE SECOND,Our old black galleon's dreaming decks;
14364,CANTO THE SECOND,"And then her face, with nods and becks,"
14365,CANTO THE SECOND,In midmost ocean glasses.
14366,CANTO THE SECOND,
14367,CANTO THE SECOND,_Chorus:_   'Twas ever the way with lasses!
14368,CANTO THE SECOND,
14369,CANTO THE SECOND,"Ah, Didymus, hast thou won indeed"
14370,CANTO THE SECOND,That Paradise which is thy meed?
14371,CANTO THE SECOND,(Thy tale not all that run may read!)
14372,CANTO THE SECOND,Thy sweet hath now no leaven!
14373,CANTO THE SECOND,"Now, like an onion in a cup"
14374,CANTO THE SECOND,"Of mead, thou liest for Jove to sup,"
14375,CANTO THE SECOND,Could Polyphemus lift thee up
14376,CANTO THE SECOND,With Titan hands to heaven!
14377,CANTO THE SECOND,
14378,CANTO THE SECOND,_Chorus:_   This great oak-cup to heaven!
14379,CANTO THE SECOND,
14380,CANTO THE SECOND,"The second canto ceased; and, as they raised"
14381,CANTO THE SECOND,"Their wine-cups with the last triumphant note,"
14382,CANTO THE SECOND,"Bacon, undaunted, raised his grating voice--"
14383,CANTO THE SECOND,"""This honey which, in some sort, may be styled"
14384,CANTO THE SECOND,"The Spettle of the Stars ..."" ""Bring the Canary!"""
14385,CANTO THE SECOND,"Ben Jonson roared. ""It is a moral wine"
14386,CANTO THE SECOND,"And suits the third, last canto!"" At one draught"
14387,CANTO THE SECOND,John Davis drained it and began anew.
14388,CANTO THE SECOND,
14389,CANTO THE SECOND,
14390,CANTO THE THIRD,CANTO THE THIRD
14391,CANTO THE THIRD,
14392,CANTO THE THIRD,A month went by. We were hoisting sail!
14393,CANTO THE THIRD,We had lost all hope of Bill;
14394,CANTO THE THIRD,"Though, laugh as you may at a seaman's tale,"
14395,CANTO THE THIRD,He was fast in his honey-comb still!
14396,CANTO THE THIRD,And often he thinks of the chaplain's word
14397,CANTO THE THIRD,"In the days he shall see no more,--"
14398,CANTO THE THIRD,"How the Sweet, indeed, of the Sour hath need;"
14399,CANTO THE THIRD,"And the Sea, likewise, of the Shore."
14400,CANTO THE THIRD,
14401,CANTO THE THIRD,_Chorus:_ The chaplain's word of the Air and a Bird;
14402,CANTO THE THIRD,"Of the Sea, likewise, and the Shore!"
14403,CANTO THE THIRD,
14404,CANTO THE THIRD,"""O, had I the wings of a dove, I would fly"
14405,CANTO THE THIRD,"To a heaven, of aloes and gall!"
14406,CANTO THE THIRD,"I have honeyed,"" he yammers, ""my nose and mine eye,"
14407,CANTO THE THIRD,And the bees cannot sting me at all!
14408,CANTO THE THIRD,"And it's O, for the sting of a little brown bee,"
14409,CANTO THE THIRD,"Or to blister my hands on a rope,"
14410,CANTO THE THIRD,Or to buffet a thundering broad-side sea
14411,CANTO THE THIRD,"On a deck like a mountain-slope!"""
14412,CANTO THE THIRD,
14413,CANTO THE THIRD,"_Chorus:_ With her mast snapt short, and a list to port"
14414,CANTO THE THIRD,And a deck like a mountain-slope.
14415,CANTO THE THIRD,
14416,CANTO THE THIRD,"But alas, and he thinks of the chaplain's voice"
14417,CANTO THE THIRD,When that roar from the woods out-break--
14418,CANTO THE THIRD,"_R-r-re-joice! R-r-re-joice!_ ""Now, wherefore rejoice"
14419,CANTO THE THIRD,In the music a bear could make?
14420,CANTO THE THIRD,"'Tis a judgment, maybe, that I stick in this tree;"
14421,CANTO THE THIRD,Yet in this I out-argued him fair!
14422,CANTO THE THIRD,"Though I live, though I die, in this honey-comb pie,"
14423,CANTO THE THIRD,"By Pope Joan, there's no sense in a bear!"""
14424,CANTO THE THIRD,
14425,CANTO THE THIRD,"_Chorus:_ Notes in a nightingale, plums in a pie,"
14426,CANTO THE THIRD,"By'r Lakin, no _Sense_ in a _Bear_!"
14427,CANTO THE THIRD,
14428,CANTO THE THIRD,He knew not our anchor was heaved from the mud:
14429,CANTO THE THIRD,"He was growling it over again,"
14430,CANTO THE THIRD,"When--a strange sound suddenly froze his blood,"
14431,CANTO THE THIRD,And curdled his big slow brain!--
14432,CANTO THE THIRD,"A marvellous sound, as of great steel claws"
14433,CANTO THE THIRD,"Gripping the bark of his tree,"
14434,CANTO THE THIRD,Softly ascended! Like lightning ended
14435,CANTO THE THIRD,His honey-comb reverie!
14436,CANTO THE THIRD,
14437,CANTO THE THIRD,_Chorus:_ The honey-comb quivered! The little leaves shivered!
14438,CANTO THE THIRD,_Something was climbing the tree!_
14439,CANTO THE THIRD,
14440,CANTO THE THIRD,"Something that breathed like a fat sea-cook,"
14441,CANTO THE THIRD,Or a pirate of fourteen ton!
14442,CANTO THE THIRD,But it clomb like a cat (tho' the whole tree shook)
14443,CANTO THE THIRD,"Stealthily tow'rds the sun,"
14444,CANTO THE THIRD,"Till, as Black Bill gapes at the little blue ring"
14445,CANTO THE THIRD,"Overhead, which he calls the sky,"
14446,CANTO THE THIRD,It is clean blotted out by a monstrous Thing
14447,CANTO THE THIRD,Which--_hath larded its nose and its eye._
14448,CANTO THE THIRD,
14449,CANTO THE THIRD,"_Chorus:_ O, well for thee, Bill, that this monstrous Thing"
14450,CANTO THE THIRD,Hath blinkered its little red eye.
14451,CANTO THE THIRD,
14452,CANTO THE THIRD,Still as a mouse lies Bill with his face
14453,CANTO THE THIRD,"Low down in the dark sweet gold,"
14454,CANTO THE THIRD,While this monster turns round in the leaf-fringed space!
14455,CANTO THE THIRD,"Then--taking a good firm hold,"
14456,CANTO THE THIRD,"As the skipper descending the cabin-stair,"
14457,CANTO THE THIRD,"Tail-first with a vast slow tread,"
14458,CANTO THE THIRD,"Solemnly, softly, cometh this Bear"
14459,CANTO THE THIRD,Straight down o'er the Bo'sun's head.
14460,CANTO THE THIRD,
14461,CANTO THE THIRD,"_Chorus:_ Solemnly--slowly--cometh this Bear,"
14462,CANTO THE THIRD,Tail-first o'er the Bo'sun's head.
14463,CANTO THE THIRD,
14464,CANTO THE THIRD,Nearer--nearer--then all Bill's breath
14465,CANTO THE THIRD,Out-bursts in one leap and yell!
14466,CANTO THE THIRD,"And this Bear thinks, ""Now am I gripped from beneath"
14467,CANTO THE THIRD,"By a roaring devil from hell!"""
14468,CANTO THE THIRD,"And madly Bill clutches his brown bow-legs,"
14469,CANTO THE THIRD,"And madly this Bear doth hale,"
14470,CANTO THE THIRD,With his little red eyes fear-mad for the skies
14471,CANTO THE THIRD,And Bill's teeth fast in his tail!
14472,CANTO THE THIRD,
14473,CANTO THE THIRD,_Chorus:_   Small wonder a Bear should quail!
14474,CANTO THE THIRD,"To have larded his nose, to have greased his eyes,"
14475,CANTO THE THIRD,And be stung at the last in his tail.
14476,CANTO THE THIRD,
14477,CANTO THE THIRD,"Pull, Bo'sun! Pull, Bear! In the hot sweet gloom,"
14478,CANTO THE THIRD,"Pull Bruin, pull Bill, for the skies!"
14479,CANTO THE THIRD,Pull--out of their gold with a bombard's boom
14480,CANTO THE THIRD,Come Black Bill's honeyed thighs!
14481,CANTO THE THIRD,"Pull! Up! Up! Up! with a scuffle and scramble,"
14482,CANTO THE THIRD,"To that little blue ring of bliss,"
14483,CANTO THE THIRD,This Bear doth go with our Bo'sun in tow
14484,CANTO THE THIRD,"Stinging his tail, I wis."
14485,CANTO THE THIRD,
14486,CANTO THE THIRD,"_Chorus:_ And this Bear thinks--""Many great bees I know,"
14487,CANTO THE THIRD,"But there never was Bee like this!"""
14488,CANTO THE THIRD,
14489,CANTO THE THIRD,All in the gorgeous death of day
14490,CANTO THE THIRD,"We had slipped from our emerald creek,"
14491,CANTO THE THIRD,And our _Cloud i' the Sun_ was careening away
14492,CANTO THE THIRD,"With the old gay flag at the peak,"
14493,CANTO THE THIRD,"When, suddenly, out of the purple wood,"
14494,CANTO THE THIRD,Breast-high thro' the lilies there danced
14495,CANTO THE THIRD,"A tall lean figure, black as a nigger,"
14496,CANTO THE THIRD,That shouted and waved and pranced!
14497,CANTO THE THIRD,
14498,CANTO THE THIRD,"_Chorus:_ A gold-greased figure, but black as a nigger,"
14499,CANTO THE THIRD,Waving his shirt as he pranced!
14500,CANTO THE THIRD,
14501,CANTO THE THIRD,"""'Tis Hylas! 'Tis Hylas!"" our chaplain flutes,"
14502,CANTO THE THIRD,And our skipper he looses a shout!
14503,CANTO THE THIRD,"""'Tis Bill! Black Bill, in his old sea-boots!"
14504,CANTO THE THIRD,_Stand by to bring her about!
14505,CANTO THE THIRD,"Har-r-rd a-starboard!""_ And round we came,"
14506,CANTO THE THIRD,"With a lurch and a dip and a roll,"
14507,CANTO THE THIRD,And a banging boom thro' the rose-red gloom
14508,CANTO THE THIRD,For our old Black Bo'sun's soul!
14509,CANTO THE THIRD,
14510,CANTO THE THIRD,_Chorus:_ Alive! Not dead! Tho' behind his head
14511,CANTO THE THIRD,He'd a seraphin's aureole!
14512,CANTO THE THIRD,
14513,CANTO THE THIRD,"And our chaplain he sniffs, as Bill finished his tale,"
14514,CANTO THE THIRD,(With the honey still scenting his hair!)
14515,CANTO THE THIRD,O'er a plate of salt beef and a mug of old ale--
14516,CANTO THE THIRD,"""By Pope Joan, there's no sense in a bear!"""
14517,CANTO THE THIRD,"And we laughed, but our Bo'sun he solemnly growls"
14518,CANTO THE THIRD,"--""Till the sails of yon heavens be furled,"
14519,CANTO THE THIRD,"It taketh--now, mark!--all the beasts in the Ark,"
14520,CANTO THE THIRD,"Teeth and claws, too, to make a good world!"""
14521,CANTO THE THIRD,
14522,CANTO THE THIRD,"Chorus: Till the great--blue--sails--be--furled,"
14523,CANTO THE THIRD,"It taketh--now, mark!--all the beasts in the Ark,"
14524,CANTO THE THIRD,"Teeth and claws, too, to make a good world!"
14525,CANTO THE THIRD,
14526,CANTO THE THIRD,
14527,CANTO THE THIRD,"""Sack! Sack! Canary! Malmsey! Muscadel!""--"
14528,CANTO THE THIRD,"As the last canto ceased, the Mermaid Inn"
14529,CANTO THE THIRD,Chorussed. I flew from laughing voice to voice;
14530,CANTO THE THIRD,"But, over all the hubbub, rose the drone"
14531,CANTO THE THIRD,"Of Francis Bacon,--""Now, this Muscovy"
14532,CANTO THE THIRD,"Is a cold clime, not favourable to bees"
14533,CANTO THE THIRD,"(Or love, which is a weakness of the south)"
14534,CANTO THE THIRD,"As well might be supposed. Yet, as hot lands"
14535,CANTO THE THIRD,"Gender hot fruits and odoriferous spice,"
14536,CANTO THE THIRD,In this case we may think that honey and flowers
14537,CANTO THE THIRD,Are comparable with the light airs of May
14538,CANTO THE THIRD,"And a more temperate region. Also we see,"
14539,CANTO THE THIRD,"As Pliny saith, this honey being a swette"
14540,CANTO THE THIRD,"Of heaven, a certain spettle of the stars,"
14541,CANTO THE THIRD,"Which, gathering unclean vapours as it falls,"
14542,CANTO THE THIRD,"Hangs as a fat dew on the boughs, the bees"

14860,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Of orange-peel and civet, as all of these"
14861,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Were but the clay churned by the glorious rush
14862,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Of his white chariots and his burning steeds,"
14863,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Nay, as the clay were a shadow, his great dreams,"
14864,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Like bannered legions on some proud crusade,"
14865,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Empurpling all the deserts of the world,"
14866,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Swept on in triumph to the glittering towers
14867,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Of his abiding City.
14868,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Then--he met
14869,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"That damned blood-sucking cockatrice, the pug"
14870,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Of some fine strutting mummer, one of those plagues"
14871,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Bred by our stage, a puff-ball on the hill"
14872,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Of Helicon. As for his wench--she too
14873,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Had played so many parts that she forgot
14874,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,The cue for truth. King Puff had taught her well.
14875,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"He was the vainer and more foolish thing,"
14876,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,She the more poisonous.
14877,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"One dark day, to spite"
14878,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Archer, her latest paramour, a friend"
14879,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"And apple-squire to Puff, she set her eyes"
14880,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"On Marlowe ... feigned a joy in his young art,"
14881,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Murmured his songs, used all her London tricks"
14882,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"To coney-catch the country greenhorn. Man,"
14883,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Kit never even _saw_ her painted face!
14884,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,He pored on books by candle-light and saw
14885,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Everything thro' a mist. O, I could laugh"
14886,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"To think of it, only--his up-turned skull"
14887,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"There, in the dark, now that the flesh drops off,"
14888,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Has laughed enough, a horrible silent laugh,"
14889,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"To think his Angel of Light was, after all,"
14890,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Only the red-lipped Angel of the Plague.
14891,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"He was no better than the rest of us,"
14892,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,No worse. He felt the heat. He felt the cold.
14893,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,He took her down to Deptford to escape
14894,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Contagion, and the crashing of sextons' spades"
14895,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,On dead men's bones in every churchyard round;
14896,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"The jangling bell and the cry, _Bring out your dead_."
14897,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"And there she told him of her luckless life,"
14898,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Wedded, deserted, both against her will,"
14899,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,A luckless Eve that never knew the snake.
14900,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"True and half-true she mixed in one wild lie,"
14901,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,And then--she caught him by the hand and wept.
14902,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,No death-cart passed to warn him with its bell.
14903,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Her eyes, her perfumed hair, and her red mouth,"
14904,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Her warm white breast, her civet-scented skin,"
14905,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Swimming before him, in a piteous mist,"
14906,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Made the lad drunk, and--she was in his arms;"
14907,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,And all that God had meant to wake one day
14908,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Under the Sun of Love, suddenly woke"
14909,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"By candle-light and cried, 'The Sun; The Sun!'"
14910,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"And he believed it, Chapman, he believed it!"
14911,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"He was a cobbler's son, and he believed"
14912,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"In Love! Blind, through that mist, he caught at Love,"
14913,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,The everlasting King of all this world.
14914,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
14915,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Kit was not clever. Clever men--like Pomp--
14916,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Might jest. And fools might laugh. But when a man,"
14917,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Simple as all great elemental things,"
14918,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Makes his whole heart a sacrificial fire
14919,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"To one whose love is in her supple skin,"
14920,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,There comes a laughter in which jests break up
14921,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Like icebergs in a sea of burning marl.
14922,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Then dreamers turn to murderers in an hour.
14923,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Then topless towers are burnt, and the Ocean-sea"
14924,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Tramples the proud fleet, down, into the dark,"
14925,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"And sweeps over it, laughing. Come and see,"
14926,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"The heart now of this darkness--no more waves,"
14927,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,But the black central hollow where that wreck
14928,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Went down for ever.
14929,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,How should Piers Penniless
14930,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Brand that wild picture on the world's black heart?--
14931,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Last night I tried the way of the Florentine,"
14932,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,And bruised myself; but we are friends together
14933,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Mourning a dead friend, none will ever know!--"
14934,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Kit, do you smile at poor Piers Penniless,"
14935,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Measuring it out? Ah, boy, it is my best!"
14936,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Since hearts must beat, let it be _terza rima_,"
14937,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,A ladder of rhyme that two sad friends alone
14938,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"May let down, thus, to the last circle of hell."""
14939,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
14940,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"So saying, and motionless as a man in trance,"
14941,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Nash breathed the words that raised the veil anew,"
14942,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Strange intervolving words which, as he spake them,"
14943,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Moved like the huge slow whirlpool of that pit
14944,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Where the wreck sank, the serpentine slow folds"
14945,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Of the lewd Kraken that sucked it, shuddering, down:--"
14946,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
14947,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,This is the Deptford Inn. Climb the dark stair.
14948,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Come, come and see Kit Marlowe lying dead!"
14949,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"See, on the table, by that broken chair,"
14950,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
14951,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,The little phials of paint--the white and red.
14952,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"A cut-lawn kerchief hangs behind the door,"
14953,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Left by his punk, even as the tapster said."
14954,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
14955,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"There is the gold-fringed taffeta gown she wore,"
14956,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"And, on that wine-stained bed, as is most meet,"
14957,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"He lies alone, never to waken more."
14958,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
14959,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"O, still as chiselled marble, the frayed sheet"
14960,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Folds the still form on that sepulchral bed,"
14961,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Hides the dead face, and peaks the rigid feet."
14962,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
14963,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Come, come and see Kit Marlowe lying dead!"
14964,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Draw back the sheet, ah, tenderly lay bare"
14965,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,The splendour of that Apollonian head;
14966,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
14967,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,The gloriole of his flame-coloured hair;
14968,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"The lean athletic body, deftly planned"
14969,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,To carry that swift soul of fire and air;
14970,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
14971,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"The long thin flanks, the broad breast, and the grand"
14972,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Heroic shoulders! Look, what lost dreams lie"
14973,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Cold in the fingers of that delicate hand;
14974,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
14975,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"And, shut within those lyric lips, what cry"
14976,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Of unborn beauty, sunk in utter night,"
14977,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Lost worlds of song, sealed in an unknown sky,"
14978,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
14979,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Never to be brought forth, clothed on with light."
14980,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Was this, then, this the secret of his song?--"
14981,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,_Who ever loved that loved not at first?_
14982,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
14983,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"It was not Love, not Love, that wrought this wrong;"
14984,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,And yet--what evil shadow of this dark town
14985,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Could quench a soul so flame-like clean and strong,"
14986,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
14987,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Strike the young glory of his manhood down,"
14988,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Dead, like a dog, dead in a drunken brawl,"
14989,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Dead for a phial of paint, a taffeta gown?"
14990,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
14991,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,What if his blood were hot?   High over all
14992,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"He heard, as in his song the world still hears,"
14993,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Those angels on the burning heavenly wall
14994,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
14995,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Who chant the thunder-music of the spheres.
14996,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Yet--through the glory of his own young dream
14997,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Here did he meet that face, wet with strange tears,"
14998,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
14999,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Andromeda, with piteous face astream,"
15000,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Hailing him, Perseus. In her treacherous eyes"
15001,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"As in dark pools the mirrored stars will gleam,"
15002,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15003,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Here did he see his own eternal skies;
15004,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"And here--she laughed, nor found the dream amiss;"
15005,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,But bade him pluck and eat--in Paradise.
15006,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15007,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Here did she hold him, broken up with bliss,"
15008,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Here, like a supple snake, around him coiled,"
15009,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Here did she pluck his heart out with a kiss,"
15010,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15011,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Here were the wings clipped and the glory soiled,"
15012,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Here adders coupled in the pure white shrine,"
15013,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Here was the Wine spilt, and the Shew-bread spoiled."
15014,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15015,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Black was that feast, though he who poured the Wine"
15016,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Dreamed that he poured it in high sacrament.
15017,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Deep in her eyes he saw his own eyes shine,"
15018,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15019,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Beheld Love's god-head and was well content.
15020,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Subtly her hand struck the pure silver note,"
15021,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,The throbbing chord of passion that God meant
15022,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15023,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,To swell the bliss of heaven. Round his young throat
15024,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"She wound her swarthy tresses; then, with eyes"
15025,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Half mad to see their power, half mad to gloat,"
15026,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15027,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Half mad to batten on their own devilries,"
15028,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"And mark what heaven-born splendours they could quell,"
15029,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"She held him quivering in a mesh of lies,"
15030,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15031,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,And in soft broken speech began to tell--
15032,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"There as, against her heart, throbbing he lay--"
15033,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,The truth that hurled his soul from heaven to hell.
15034,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15035,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Quivering, she watched the subtle whip-lash flay"
15036,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,The white flesh of the dreams of his pure youth;
15037,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Then sucked the blood and left them cold as clay.
15038,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15039,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Luxuriously she lashed him with the truth.
15040,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Against his mouth her subtle mouth she set
15041,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"To show, as through a mask, O, without ruth,"
15042,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15043,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,As through a cold clay mask (brackish and wet
15044,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"With what strange tears!) it was not his, not his,"
15045,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,The kiss that through his quivering lips she met.
15046,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15047,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Kissing him, ""_Thus_,"" she whispered, ""_did he kiss."
15048,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Ah, is the sweetness like a sword, then, sweet?"
15049,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Last night--ah, kiss again--aching with bliss,_"
15050,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15051,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"_Thus was I made his own, from head to feet._"""
15052,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,--A sudden agony thro' his body swept
15053,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Tempestuously.--""_Our wedded pulses beat_"
15054,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15055,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"_Like this and this; and then, at dawn, he slept._"""
15056,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"She laughed, pouting her lips against his cheek"
15057,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"To drink; and, as in answer, Marlowe wept."
15058,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15059,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"As a dead man in dreams, he heard her speak."
15060,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Clasped in the bitter grave of that sweet clay,"
15061,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Wedded and one with it, he moaned. Too weak"
15062,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15063,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Even to lift his head, sobbing, he lay,"
15064,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Then, slowly, as their breathings rose and fell,"
15065,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"He felt the storm of passion, far away,"
15066,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15067,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Gather. The shuddering waves began to swell.
15068,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"And, through the menace of the thunder-roll,"
15069,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"The thin quick lightnings, thrilling through his hell,"
15070,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15071,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Lightnings that hell itself could not control
15072,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,(Even while she strove to bow his neck anew)
15073,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Woke the great slumbering legions of his soul.
15074,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15075,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Sharp was that severance of the false and true,"
15076,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Sharp as a sword drawn from a shuddering wound.
15077,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"But they, that were one flesh, were cloven in two."
15078,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15079,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Flesh leapt from clasping flesh, without a sound."
15080,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"He plucked his body from her white embrace,"
15081,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"And cast him down, and grovelled on the ground."
15082,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15083,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Yet, ere he went, he strove once more to trace,"
15084,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Deep in her eyes, the loveliness he knew;"
15085,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Then--spat his hatred into her smiling face.
15086,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15087,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,She clung to him. He flung her off. He drew
15088,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"His dagger, thumbed the blade, and laughed--""Poor punk!"
15089,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"What? Would you make me your own murderer, too?"""
15090,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15091,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,*   *   *   *
15092,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15093,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"""That was the day of our great feast,"" said Nash,"
15094,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"""Aboard the _Golden Hynde_. The grand old hulk"
15095,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Was drawn up for the citizens' wonderment
15096,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"At Deptford. Ay, Piers Penniless was there!"
15097,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Soaked and besotted as I was, I saw"
15098,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Everything. On her poop the minstrels played,"
15099,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"And round her sea-worn keel, like meadow-sweet"
15100,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Curtseying round a lightning-blackened oak,"
15101,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Prentices and their sweethearts, heel and toe,"
15102,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Danced the brave English dances, clean and fresh"
15103,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,As May.
15104,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,But in her broad gun-guarded waist
15105,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Once red with British blood, long tables groaned"
15106,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,For revellers not so worthy. Where her guns
15107,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Had raked the seas, barrels of ale were sprung,"
15108,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Bestrid by roaring tipplers. Where at night
15109,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,The storm-beat crew silently bowed their heads
15110,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"With Drake before the King of Life and Death,"
15111,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,A strumpet wrestled with a mountebank
15112,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"For pence, a loose-limbed Lais with a clown"
15113,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Of Cherry Hilton. Leering at their lewd twists,"
15114,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Cross-legged upon the deck, sluggish with sack,"
15115,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Like a squat toad sat Puff ...
15116,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Propped up against the bulwarks, at his side,"
15117,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Archer, his apple-squire, hiccoughed a bawdy song."
15118,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Suddenly, through that orgy, with wild eyes,"
15119,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Yet with her customary smile, O, there"
15120,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,I saw in daylight what Kit Marlowe saw
15121,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Through blinding mists, the face of his first love."
15122,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"She stood before her paramour on the deck,"
15123,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Cocking her painted head to right and left,"
15124,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Her white teeth smiling, but her voice a hiss:"
15125,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"'Quickly,' she said to Archer, 'come away,"
15126,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Or there'll be blood spilt!'
15127,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"'Better blood than wine,'"
15128,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Said Archer, struggling to his feet, 'but who,"
15129,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Who would spill blood?'
15130,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,'Marlowe!' she said.
15131,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Then Puff
15132,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Reeled to his feet. 'What, Kit, the cobbler's son?"
15133,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"The lad that broke his leg at the _Red Bull_,"
15134,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Tamburlaine-Marlowe, he that would chain kings"
15135,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"To's chariot-wheel? What, is he rushing hither?"
15136,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"He would spill blood for Gloriana, hey?"
15137,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"O, my Belphoebe, you will crack my sides!"
15138,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Was this the wench that shipped a thousand squires?
15139,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"O, ho! But here he comes. Now, solemnly, lads,--"
15140,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,_Now walk the angels on the walls of heaven
15141,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,To entertain divine Zenocrate!_'
15142,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"And there stood Kit, high on the storm-scarred poop,"
15143,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Against the sky, bare-headed. I saw his face,"
15144,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Pale, innocent, just the dear face of that boy"
15145,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Who walked to Cambridge with a bundle and stick,--"
15146,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,The little cobbler's son. Yet--there I caught
15147,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"My only glimpse of how the sun-god looked,"
15148,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,And only for one moment.
15149,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,When he saw
15150,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"His mistress, his face whitened, and he shook."
15151,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Down to the deck he came, a poor weak man;"
15152,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,And yet--by God--the only man that day
15153,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,In all our drunken crew.
15154,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"'Come along, Kit,'"
15155,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Cried Puff, 'we'll all be friends now, all take hands,"
15156,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,And dance--ha! ha!--the shaking of the sheets!'
15157,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Then Archer, shuffling a step, raised his cracked voice"
15158,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"In Kit's own song to a falsetto tune,"
15159,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Snapping one hand, thus, over his head as he danced:--"
15160,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15161,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"'_Come, live with me, and be my love,"
15162,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,And we will all the pleasures prove!_' ...
15163,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,
15164,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Puff reeled between, laughing. 'Damn you,' cried Kit,"
15165,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"And, catching the fat swine by his round soft throat,"
15166,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Hurled him headlong, crashing across the tables,"
15167,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,To lie and groan in the red bilge of wine
15168,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,That washed the scuppers.
15169,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Kit gave him not one glance.
15170,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"'Archer,' he said in a whisper."
15171,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Instantly
15172,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,A long thin rapier flashed in Archer's hand.
15173,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,The ship was one wild uproar. Women screamed
15174,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,And huddled together. A drunken clamorous ring
15175,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Seethed around Marlowe and his enemy.
15176,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Kit drew his dagger, slowly, and I knew"
15177,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Blood would be spilt.
15178,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"'Here, take my rapier, Kit!'"
15179,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"I cried across the crowd, seeing the lad"
15180,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Was armed so slightly. But he did not hear.
15181,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,I could not reach him.
15182,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,All at once he leapt
15183,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Like a wounded tiger, past the rapier point"
15184,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Straight at his enemy's throat. I saw his hand
15185,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Up-raised to strike! I heard a harlot's scream,"
15186,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"And, in mid-air, the hand stayed, quivering, white,"
15187,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,A frozen menace.
15188,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,I saw a yellow claw
15189,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,Twisting the dagger out of that frozen hand;
15190,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"I saw his own steel in that yellow grip,"
15191,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,His own lost lightning raised to strike at him!
15192,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,I saw it flash! I heard the driving grunt
15193,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Of him that struck! Then, with a shout, the crowd"
15194,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Sundered, and through the gap, a blank red thing"
15195,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Streaming with blood came the blind face of Kit,"
15196,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Reeling, to me! And I, poor drunken I,"
15197,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"Held my arms wide for him. Here, on my breast,"
15198,THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SHOE,"With one great sob, he burst his heart and died."""

15511,I,"And ""_Tickle your tabor, Tom_,"" I cried, ""_we're going to Sherwood now_!"""
15512,I,
15513,I,"When cocks were crowing, and light was growing, and horns were blowing,"
15514,I,"and milk-pails flowing,"
15515,I,"We swam thro' waves of emerald gloom along a chestnut aisle,"
15516,I,"Then, up a shining hawthorn-lane, we sailed into the sun again,"
15517,I,"Will Kemp and his companion, his companion of a mile."
15518,I,
15519,I,"""Truer than most,"" snarled Kemp, ""but mostly lies!"
15520,I,And why does he forget the miry lanes
15521,I,"By Brainford with thick woods on either side,"
15522,I,"And the deep holes, where I could find no ease"
15523,I,"But skipped up to my waist?"" A crackling laugh"
15524,I,"Broke from his lips which, if he had not worn"
15525,I,"The cap and bells, would scarce have roused the mirth"
15526,I,"Of good Sir John, who roundly echoed it,"
15527,I,"Then waved his hand and said, ""Nay, but he treats"
15528,I,"Your morrice in the spirit of Lucian, Will,"
15529,I,"Who thought that dancing was no mushroom growth,"
15530,I,But sprung from the beginning of the world
15531,I,"When Love persuaded earth, air, water, fire,"
15532,I,And all the jarring elements to move
15533,I,"In measure. Right to the heart of it, my lad,"
15534,I,"The song goes, though the skin mislike you so."""
15535,I,"""Nay, an there's more of it, I'll sing it, too!"
15536,I,"'Tis a fine tale, Sir John, I have it by heart,"
15537,I,"Although 'tis lies throughout."" Up leapt Will Kemp,"
15538,I,"And crouched and swayed, and swung his bauble round,"
15539,I,"Making the measure as they trolled the tale,"
15540,I,"Chanting alternately, each answering each."

15544,II,
15545,II,_The Fool_
15546,II,
15547,II,"The tabor fainted far behind us, but her feet that day"
15548,II,They beat a rosier morrice o'er the fairy-circled green.
15549,II,
15550,II,_Sir John_
15551,II,
15552,II,"And o'er a field of buttercups, a field of lambs and buttercups,"
15553,II,"We danced along a cloth of gold, a summer king and queen!"
15554,II,
15555,II,_The Fool_
15556,II,
15557,II,"And straying we went, and swaying we went, with lambkins round us"
15558,II,playing we went;
15559,II,"Her face uplift to drink the sun, and not for me her smile,"
15560,II,"We danced, a king and queen of May, upon a fleeting holy-day,"
15561,II,"But O, she'd won her wager, my companion of a mile!"
15562,II,
15563,II,_Sir John_
15564,II,
15565,II,"Her rosy lips they never spoke, though every rosy foot-fall broke"
15566,II,"The dust, the dust to Eden-bloom; and, past the throbbing blue,"
15567,II,"All ordered to her rhythmic feet, the stars were dancing with my sweet,"
15568,II,And all the world a morrice-dance!
15569,II,
15570,II,_The Fool_
15571,II,
15572,II,She knew not; but I knew!
15573,II,"Love like Amphion with his lyre, made all the elements conspire"
15574,II,"To build His world of music. All in rhythmic rank and file,"
15575,II,"I saw them in their cosmic dance, catch hands across, retire, advance,"
15576,II,"For me and my companion, my companion of a mile!"
15577,II,
15578,II,_Sir John_
15579,II,
15580,II,"The little leaves on every tree, the rivers winding to the sea,"
15581,II,"The swinging tides, the wheeling winds, the rolling heavens above,"
15582,II,"Around the May-pole Igdrasil, they worked the Morrice-master's will,"
15583,II,Persuaded into measure by the all-creative Love.
15584,II,
15585,II,"That hour I saw, from depth to height, this wildering universe unite!"
15586,II,The lambs of God around us and His passion in every flower!
15587,II,
15588,II,_The Fool_
15589,II,
15590,II,"His grandeur in the dust, His dust a blaze of blinding majesty,"
15591,II,And all His immortality in one poor mortal hour.
15592,II,
15593,II,"And Death was but a change of key in Life the golden melody,"
15594,II,"And Time became Eternity, and Heaven a fleeting smile;"
15595,II,"For all was each and each was all, and all a wedded unity,"
15596,II,"Her heart in mine, and mine in my companion of a mile."
15597,II,
15598,II,"_Thwack_! _Thwack_! He whirled his bauble round about,"
15599,II,"""This fellow beats them all,"" he cried, ""the worst"
15600,II,Those others wrote was that I hopped from York
15601,II,To Paris with a mortar on my head.
15602,II,This fellow sends me leaping through the clouds
15603,II,To buss the moon! The best is yet to come;
15604,II,"Strike up, Sir John! Ha! ha! You know no more?"""
15605,II,"Kemp leapt upon a table. ""Clear the way"","
15606,II,"He cried, and with a great stamp of his foot"
15607,II,"And a wild crackling laugh, drew all to hark,"
15608,II,"""With hey and ho, through thick and thin,"
15609,II,"The hobby-horse is forgotten,"
15610,II,"But I must finish what I begin,"
15611,II,Tho' all the roads be rotten.
15612,II,
15613,II,"""By all those twenty thousand chariots, Ben,"
15614,II,"Hear this true tale they shall! Now, let me see,"
15615,II,Where was Will Kemp? Bussing the moon's pale mouth?
15616,II,"Ah, yes!"" He crouched above the listening throng,--"
15617,II,"""_Good as a play_,"" I heard one whispering quean,--"
15618,II,"And, waving his bauble, shuffling with his feet"
15619,II,"In a dance that marked the time, he sank his voice"
15620,II,"As if to breathe great secrets, and so sang:--"
15621,II,
15622,II,
15623,III,III
15624,III,
15625,III,"At Melford town, at Melford town, at little grey-roofed Melford town,"
15626,III,"A long mile from Sudbury, upon the village green,"
15627,III,We danced into a merry rout of country-folk that skipt about
15628,III,"A hobby-horse, a May-pole, and a laughing white-pot queen."
15629,III,
15630,III,"They thronged about us as we stayed, and there I gave my sunshine maid"
15631,III,An English crown for cakes and ale--her dancing was so true!
15632,III,"And ""Nay,"" she said, ""I danced my mile for love!"" I answered with a smile,"
15633,III,"""'Tis but a silver token, lass, 'thou'st won that wager, too."""
15634,III,
15635,III,"I took my leash of morrice-bells, my treble, bass and tenor bells,"
15636,III,They pealed like distant marriage-bells! And up came William Bee
15637,III,"With Georgie Sprat, my overseer, and Thomas Slye, my tabourer,"
15638,III,"""Farewell,"" she laughed, and vanished with a Suffolk courtesie."
15639,III,"I leapt away to Rockland, and from Rockland on to Hingham,"
15640,III,"From Hingham on to Norwich, sirs! I hardly heard a-while"
15641,III,"The throngs that followed after, with their shouting and their laughter,"
15642,III,"For a shadow danced beside me, my companion of a mile!"
15643,III,
15644,III,"At Norwich, by St. Giles his gate, I entered, and the Mayor in state,"
15645,III,"With all the rosy knights and squires for twenty miles about,"
15646,III,"With trumpets and with minstrelsy, was waiting there to welcome me;"
15647,III,"And, as I skipt into the street, the City raised a shout."
15648,III,
15649,III,They gave me what I did not seek. I fed on roasted swans a week!
15650,III,"They pledged me in their malmsey, and they lined me warm with ale!"
15651,III,"They sleeked my skin with red-deer pies, and all that runs and"
15652,III,swims and flies;
15653,III,"But, through the clashing wine-cups, O, I heard her clanking pail."
15654,III,
15655,III,"And, rising from his crimson chair, the worshipful and portly Mayor"
15656,III,"Bequeathed me forty shillings every year that I should live,"
15657,III,With five good angels in my hand that I might drink while I could stand!
15658,III,They gave me golden angels! What I lacked they could not give.
15659,III,
15660,III,"They made Will Kemp, thenceforward, sirs, Freeman of Marchaunt Venturers!"
15661,III,They hoped that I would dance again from Norwich up to York;
15662,III,"Then they asked me, all together, had I met with right May weather,"
15663,III,"And they praised my heels of feather, and my heart, my heart of cork."
15664,III,
15665,III,*   *   *   *
15666,III,
15667,III,"As I came home by Sudbury, by little red-roofed Sudbury,"
15668,III,"I waited for my bare-foot maid, among her satin kine!"
15669,III,"I heard a peal of wedding-bells, of treble, bass and tenor bells:"
15670,III,"""Ring well,"" I cried, ""this bridal morn! You soon shall ring for mine!"""
15671,III,
15672,III,"I found her foot-prints in the grass, just where she stood and saw me pass."
15673,III,I stood within her own sweet field and waited for my may.
15674,III,"I laughed. The dance has turned about! I stand within: she'll pass without,"
15675,III,"And--_down the road the wedding came, the road I danced that day_!"
15676,III,
15677,III,"_I saw the wedding-folk go by, with laughter and with minstrelsy,"
15678,III,"I gazed across her own sweet hedge, I caught her happy smile,"
15679,III,"I saw the tall young butcher pass to little red-roofed Sudbury,"
15680,III,"His bride upon his arm, my lost companion of a mile._"
15681,III,
15682,III,Down from his table leapt the motley Fool.
15683,III,"His bladder bounced from head to ducking head,"
15684,III,"His crackling laugh rang high,--""Sir John, I danced"
15685,III,"In February, and the song says May!"
15686,III,"A fig for all your poets, liars all!"
15687,III,"Away to Fenchurch Street, lasses and lads,"
15688,III,They hold high revel there this May-day morn.
15689,III,"Away!"" The mad-cap throng echoed the cry."
15690,III,He drove them with his bauble through the door;
15691,III,"Then, as the last gay kerchief fluttered out"
15692,III,He gave one little sharp sad lingering cry
15693,III,As of a lute-string breaking. He turned back
15694,III,
15695,III,And threw himself along a low dark bench;
15696,III,"His jingling cap was crumpled in his fist,"
15697,III,"And, as he lay there, all along Cheapside"
15698,III,The happy voices of his comrades rang:--
15699,III,
15700,III,Out of the woods we'll dance and sing
15701,III,"Under the morning-star of Spring,"
15702,III,Into the town with our fresh boughs
15703,III,"And knock at every sleeping house,"
15704,III,"Not sighing,"
15705,III,"Or crying,"
15706,III,Though Love knows no denying!
15707,III,"Then, round your summer queen and king,"
15708,III,"Come, young lovers, dance and sing,"
15709,III,Dance and sing!
15710,III,
15711,III,"His motley shoulders heaved. I touched his arm,"
15712,III,"""What ails you, sir?"" He raised his thin white face,"
15713,III,Wet with the May-dew still. A few stray petals
15714,III,"Clung in his tangled hair. He leapt to his feet,"
15715,III,"""'Twas February, but I danced, boy, danced"
15716,III,"In May! Can you do this?"" Forward he bent"
15717,III,"Over his feet, and shuffled it, heel and toe,"
15718,III,"Out of the Mermaid, singing his old song--"
15719,III,
15720,III,"A-maying,"
15721,III,"A-playing,"
15722,III,For Love knows no gain-saying!
15723,III,"Wisdom trips not? Even so,--"
15724,III,"Come, young lovers, trip and go,"
15725,III,Trip and go.
15726,III,
15727,III,"Five minutes later, over the roaring Strand,"
15728,III,"""_Chorus!_"" I heard him crow, and half the town"
15729,III,Reeled into music under his crimson comb.

15734,BIG BEN,BIG BEN
15735,BIG BEN,
15736,BIG BEN,"Gods, what a hubbub shook our cobwebs out"
15737,BIG BEN,"The day that Chapman, Marston and our Ben"
15738,BIG BEN,Waited in Newgate for the hangman's hands.
15739,BIG BEN,
15740,BIG BEN,Chapman and Marston had been flung there first
15741,BIG BEN,For some imagined insult to the Scots
15742,BIG BEN,"In _Eastward Ho_, the play they wrote with Ben."
15743,BIG BEN,"But Ben was famous now, and our brave law"
15744,BIG BEN,Would fain have winked and passed the big man by.
15745,BIG BEN,The lesser men had straightway been condemned
15746,BIG BEN,"To have their ears cut off, their noses slit."
15747,BIG BEN,With other tortures.
15748,BIG BEN,
15749,BIG BEN,Ben had risen at that!
15750,BIG BEN,"He gripped his cudgel, called for a quart of ale,"
15751,BIG BEN,Then like Helvellyn with his rocky face
15752,BIG BEN,"And mountain-belly, he surged along Cheapside,"
15753,BIG BEN,"Snorting with wrath, and rolled into the gaol,"
15754,BIG BEN,To share the punishment.
15755,BIG BEN,
15756,BIG BEN,"""There is my mark!"
15757,BIG BEN,"'Tis not the first time you have branded me,"""
15758,BIG BEN,"Said our big Ben, and thrust his broad left thumb"
15759,BIG BEN,"Branded with T for Tyburn, into the face"
15760,BIG BEN,"Of every protest. ""That's the mark you gave me"
15761,BIG BEN,"Because I killed my man in Spitalfields,"
15762,BIG BEN,A duel honest as any your courtiers fight.
15763,BIG BEN,"But I was no Fitzdotterel, bore no gules"
15764,BIG BEN,"And azure, robbed no silk-worms for my hose,"
15765,BIG BEN,"I was Ben Jonson, out of Annandale,"
15766,BIG BEN,Bricklayer in common to the good Lord God.
15767,BIG BEN,You branded me. I am Ben Jonson still.
15768,BIG BEN,"You cannot rub it out."""
15769,BIG BEN,
15770,BIG BEN,The Mermaid Inn
15771,BIG BEN,"Buzzed like a hornet's nest, upon the day"
15772,BIG BEN,Fixed for their mutilation. And the stings
15773,BIG BEN,"Were ready, too; for rapiers flashed and clashed"
15774,BIG BEN,"Among the tankards. Dekker was there, and Nash,"
15775,BIG BEN,"Brome (Jonson's body-servant, whom he taught"
15776,BIG BEN,"His art of verse and, more than that, to love him,)"
15777,BIG BEN,And half a dozen more. They planned to meet
15778,BIG BEN,"The prisoners going to Tyburn, and attempt"
15779,BIG BEN,A desperate rescue.
15780,BIG BEN,
15781,BIG BEN,All at once we heard
15782,BIG BEN,"A great gay song come marching down the street,"
15783,BIG BEN,"A single voice, and twenty marching men,"
15784,BIG BEN,"Then the full chorus, twenty voices strong:--"
15785,BIG BEN,
15786,BIG BEN,The prentice whistles at break of day
15787,BIG BEN,"All under fair roofs and towers,"
15788,BIG BEN,When the old Cheape openeth every way
15789,BIG BEN,Her little sweet inns like flowers;
15790,BIG BEN,"And he sings like a lark, both early and late,"
15791,BIG BEN,"To think, if his house take fire,"
15792,BIG BEN,At the good _Green Dragon_ in Bishopsgate
15793,BIG BEN,He may drink to his heart's desire.
15794,BIG BEN,
15795,BIG BEN,_Chorus:_ Or sit at his ease in the old _Cross Keys_
15796,BIG BEN,And drink to his heart's desire.
15797,BIG BEN,
15798,BIG BEN,"But I, as I walk by _Red Rose Lane_,"
15799,BIG BEN,Tho' it warmeth my heart to see
15800,BIG BEN,"_The Swan_, _The Golden Hynde_, and _The Crane_,"
15801,BIG BEN,With the door set wide for me;
15802,BIG BEN,Tho' Signs like daffodils paint the strand
15803,BIG BEN,"When the thirsty bees begin,"
15804,BIG BEN,Of all the good taverns in Engeland
15805,BIG BEN,My choice is--_The Mermaid Inn_.
15806,BIG BEN,
15807,BIG BEN,"_Chorus:_ There is much to be said for _The Saracen's Head_,"
15808,BIG BEN,But my choice is _The Mermaid Inn_.
15809,BIG BEN,
15810,BIG BEN,"Into the tavern they rushed, these roaring boys."
15811,BIG BEN,"""Now broach your ripest and your best,"" they cried."
15812,BIG BEN,"""All's well! They are all released! They are on the way!"
15813,BIG BEN,Old Camden and young Selden worked the trick.
15814,BIG BEN,Where is Dame Dimpling? Where's our jolly hostess?
15815,BIG BEN,Tell her the Mermaid Tavern will have guests:
15816,BIG BEN,"We are sent to warn her. She must raid Cook's Row,"
15817,BIG BEN,And make their ovens roar. Nobody dines
15818,BIG BEN,"This day with old Duke Humphrey. Red-deer pies,"
15819,BIG BEN,"Castles of almond crust, a shield of brawn"
15820,BIG BEN,"Big as the nether millstone, barrels of wine,"
15821,BIG BEN,"Three roasted peacocks! Ben is on the way!"""
15822,BIG BEN,Then all the rafters rang with song again:--
15823,BIG BEN,
15824,BIG BEN,"There was a Prince--long since, long since!--"
15825,BIG BEN,"To East Cheape did resort,"
15826,BIG BEN,For that he loved _The Blue Boar's Head_
15827,BIG BEN,Far better than Crown or Court;
15828,BIG BEN,
15829,BIG BEN,But old King Harry in Westminster
15830,BIG BEN,"Hung up, for all to see,"
15831,BIG BEN,"Three bells of power in St. Stephen's Tower,"
15832,BIG BEN,"Yea, bells of a thousand and three,"
15833,BIG BEN,
15834,BIG BEN,"_Chorus:_ Three bells of power in a timber tower,"
15835,BIG BEN,"Thirty thousand and three,"
15836,BIG BEN,
15837,BIG BEN,For Harry the Fourth was a godly king
15838,BIG BEN,And loved great godly bells!
15839,BIG BEN,He bade them ring and he bade them swing
15840,BIG BEN,Till a man might hear nought else.
15841,BIG BEN,In every tavern it soured the sack
15842,BIG BEN,With discord and with din;
15843,BIG BEN,But they drowned it all in a madrigal
15844,BIG BEN,"Like this, at _The Mermaid Inn_."
15845,BIG BEN,
15846,BIG BEN,_Chorus:_ They drowned it all in a madrigal
15847,BIG BEN,"Like this, at _The Mermaid Inn._"
15848,BIG BEN,
15849,BIG BEN,"""But how did Selden work it?""--""Nobody knows."
15850,BIG BEN,They will be here anon. Better ask Will.
15851,BIG BEN,"He's the magician!""--""Ah, here comes Dame Dimpling!"""
15852,BIG BEN,"And, into the rollicking chaos our good Dame"
15853,BIG BEN,--A Dame of only two and thirty springs--
15854,BIG BEN,"All lavender and roses and white kerchief,"
15855,BIG BEN,"Bustled, to lay the tables."
15856,BIG BEN,
15857,BIG BEN,Fletcher flung
15858,BIG BEN,His arm around her waist and kissed her cheek.
15859,BIG BEN,"But all she said was, ""_One--two--three--four--five--"
15860,BIG BEN,"Six at a pinch, in yonder window-seat._"""
15861,BIG BEN,"""A health to our Dame Dimpling,"" Beaumont cried,"
15862,BIG BEN,"And Dekker, leaping on the old black settle,"
15863,BIG BEN,Led all their tumult into a song again:--
15864,BIG BEN,
15865,BIG BEN,What is the Mermaid's merriest toast?
15866,BIG BEN,Our hostess--good Dame Dimpling!
15867,BIG BEN,Who is it rules the Mermaid roast?
15868,BIG BEN,"Who is it bangs the Mermaid host,"
15869,BIG BEN,Tho' her hands be soft as her heart almost?
15870,BIG BEN,Dame Dimpling!
15871,BIG BEN,
15872,BIG BEN,She stands at the board in her fresh blue gown
15873,BIG BEN,With the sleeves tucked up--Dame Dimpling!
15874,BIG BEN,She rolls the white dough up and down
15875,BIG BEN,"And her pies are crisp, and her eyes are brown."
15876,BIG BEN,"So--she is the Queen of all this town,--"
15877,BIG BEN,Dame Dimpling!
15878,BIG BEN,
15879,BIG BEN,"Her sheets are white as black-thorn bloom,"
15880,BIG BEN,"White as her neck, Dame Dimpling!"
15881,BIG BEN,Her lavender sprigs in the London gloom
15882,BIG BEN,Make every little bridal-room
15883,BIG BEN,"A country nook of fresh perfume,--"
15884,BIG BEN,Dame Dimpling!
15885,BIG BEN,
15886,BIG BEN,She wears white lace on her dark brown hair:
15887,BIG BEN,"And a rose on her breast, Dame Dimpling!"
15888,BIG BEN,And who can show you a foot as fair
15889,BIG BEN,"Or an ankle as neat when she climbs the stair,"
15890,BIG BEN,"Taper in hand, and head in the air,"
15891,BIG BEN,"And a rose in her cheek?--O, past compare,"
15892,BIG BEN,Dame Dimpling!
15893,BIG BEN,
15894,BIG BEN,"""But don't forget those oyster-pies,"" cried Lyly."
15895,BIG BEN,"""Nor the roast beef,"" roared Dekker. ""Prove yourself"
15896,BIG BEN,"The Muse of meat and drink."""
15897,BIG BEN,
15898,BIG BEN,There was a shout
15899,BIG BEN,"In Bread Street, and our windows all swung wide,"
15900,BIG BEN,Six heads at each.
15901,BIG BEN,
15902,BIG BEN,Nat Field bestrode our sign
15903,BIG BEN,"And kissed the painted Mermaid on her lips,"
15904,BIG BEN,Then waved his tankard.
15905,BIG BEN,
15906,BIG BEN,"""Here they come,"" he cried."
15907,BIG BEN,"""Camden and Selden, Chapman and Marston, too,"
15908,BIG BEN,And half Will's company with our big Ben
15909,BIG BEN,"Riding upon their shoulders."""
15910,BIG BEN,
15911,BIG BEN,"""Look!"" cried Dekker,"
15912,BIG BEN,"""But where is Atlas now? O, let them have it!"
15913,BIG BEN,"A thumping chorus, lads! Let the roof crack!"""
15914,BIG BEN,And all the Mermaid clashed and banged again
15915,BIG BEN,In thunderous measure to the marching tune
15916,BIG BEN,"That rolled down Bread Street, forty voices strong:--"
15917,BIG BEN,
15918,BIG BEN,"At _Ypres Inn_, by _Wring-wren Lane_,"
15919,BIG BEN,Old John of Gaunt would dine:
15920,BIG BEN,"He scarce had opened an oyster or twain,"
15921,BIG BEN,"Or drunk one flagon of wine,"
15922,BIG BEN,"When, all along the Vintry Ward,"
15923,BIG BEN,"He heard the trumpets blow,"
15924,BIG BEN,"And a voice that roared--""If thou love thy lord,"
15925,BIG BEN,"Tell John of Gaunt to go!"""
15926,BIG BEN,
15927,BIG BEN,"_Chorus:_ A great voice roared--""If thou love thy lord,"
15928,BIG BEN,"Tell John of Gaunt to go!"""
15929,BIG BEN,
15930,BIG BEN,Then into the room rushed Haviland
15931,BIG BEN,"That fair fat Flemish host,"
15932,BIG BEN,"""They are marching hither with sword and brand,"
15933,BIG BEN,Ten thousand men--almost!
15934,BIG BEN,"It is these oysters or thy sweet life,"
15935,BIG BEN,"Thy blood or the best of the bin!""--"
15936,BIG BEN,"""Proud Pump, avaunt!"" quoth John of Gaunt,"
15937,BIG BEN,"""I will dine at _The Mermaid Inn!_"""
15938,BIG BEN,
15939,BIG BEN,"_Chorus:_ ""Proud Pump, avaunt!"" quoth John of Gaunt,"
15940,BIG BEN,"""There is wine at _The Mermaid Inn!_"""
15941,BIG BEN,
15942,BIG BEN,And in came Ben like a great galleon poised
15943,BIG BEN,"High on the white crest of a shouting wave,"
15944,BIG BEN,And then the feast began. The fragrant steam
15945,BIG BEN,As from the kitchens of Olympus drew
15946,BIG BEN,A throng of ragged urchins to our doors.
15947,BIG BEN,Ben ordered them a castellated pie
15948,BIG BEN,That rolled a cloud around them where they sat
15949,BIG BEN,Munching upon the cobblestones. Our casements
15950,BIG BEN,Dripped with the golden dews of Helicon;
15951,BIG BEN,"And, under the warm feast our cellarage"
15952,BIG BEN,Gurgled and foamed in the delicious cool
15953,BIG BEN,With crimson freshets--
15954,BIG BEN,"""Tell us,"" cried Nat Field,"
15955,BIG BEN,"When pipes began to puff. ""How did you work it?"""
15956,BIG BEN,Camden chuckled and tugged his long white beard.
15957,BIG BEN,"""Out of the mouth of babes,"" he said and shook"
15958,BIG BEN,"His head at Selden! ""O, young man, young man,"
15959,BIG BEN,There's a career before you! Selden did it.
15960,BIG BEN,"Take my advice, my children. Make young Selden"
15961,BIG BEN,Solicitor-general to the Mermaid Inn.
15962,BIG BEN,That rosy silken smile of his conceals
15963,BIG BEN,"A scholar! Yes, that suckling lawyer there"
15964,BIG BEN,Puts my grey beard to shame. His courteous airs
15965,BIG BEN,And silken manners hide the nimblest wit
15966,BIG BEN,That ever trimmed a sail to catch the wind
15967,BIG BEN,"Of courtly favour. Mark my words now, Ben,"
15968,BIG BEN,That youth will sail right up against the wind
15969,BIG BEN,"By skilful tacking. But you run it fine,"
15970,BIG BEN,"Selden, you run it fine. Take my advice"
15971,BIG BEN,"And don't be too ironical, my boy,"
15972,BIG BEN,"Or even the King will see it."""
15973,BIG BEN,He chuckled again.
15974,BIG BEN,"""But tell them of your tractate!"""
15975,BIG BEN,"""Here it is,"""
15976,BIG BEN,"Quoth Selden, twisting a lighted paper spill,"
15977,BIG BEN,"Then, with his round cherubic face aglow"
15978,BIG BEN,"Lit his long silver pipe,"
15979,BIG BEN,"""Why, first,"" he said,"
15980,BIG BEN,"""Camden being Clarencieux King-at-arms,"
15981,BIG BEN,He read the King this little tract I wrote
15982,BIG BEN,"Against tobacco."" And the Mermaid roared"
15983,BIG BEN,"With laughter. ""Well, you went the way to hang"
15984,BIG BEN,"All three of them,"" cried Lyly, ""and, as for Ben,"
15985,BIG BEN,"His Trinidado goes to bed with him."""
15986,BIG BEN,"""Green gosling, quack no more,"" Selden replied,"
15987,BIG BEN,Smiling that rosy silken smile anew.
15988,BIG BEN,"""The King's a _critic_! When have critics known"
15989,BIG BEN,"The poet from his creatures, God from me?"
15990,BIG BEN,How many cite Polonius to their sons
15991,BIG BEN,"And call it Shakespeare? Well, I took my text"
15992,BIG BEN,"From sundry creatures of our great big Ben,"
15993,BIG BEN,And called it 'Jonson.'
15994,BIG BEN,Camden read it out
15995,BIG BEN,Without the flicker of an eye. His beard
15996,BIG BEN,"Saved us, I think. The King admired his text."
15997,BIG BEN,"'_There is a man_,' he read, '_lies at death's door"
15998,BIG BEN,Thro' taking of tobacco. Yesterday
15999,BIG BEN,He voided a bushel of soot_.'
16000,BIG BEN,"'God bless my soul,"
16001,BIG BEN,A bushel of soot! Think of it!' said the King.
16002,BIG BEN,"'The man who wrote those great and splendid words,'"
16003,BIG BEN,"Camden replied,--I had prepared his case"
16004,BIG BEN,"Carefully--'lies in Newgate prison, sire."
16005,BIG BEN,His nose and ears await the hangman's knife.'
16006,BIG BEN,
16007,BIG BEN,"'Ah,' said the shrewd King, goggling his great eyes"
16008,BIG BEN,Cannily. 'Did he not defame the Scots?'
16009,BIG BEN,"'That's true,' said Camden, like a man that hears"
16010,BIG BEN,"Truth for the first time. 'O ay, he defamed 'em,'"
16011,BIG BEN,"The King said, very wisely, once again."
16012,BIG BEN,"'Ah, but,' says Camden, like a man that strives"
16013,BIG BEN,"With more than mortal wit, 'only such Scots"
16014,BIG BEN,"As flout your majesty, and take tobacco."
16015,BIG BEN,"He is a Scot, himself, and hath the gift"
16016,BIG BEN,Of preaching.' Then we gave him Jonson's lines
16017,BIG BEN,Against Virginia. '_Neither do thou lust
16018,BIG BEN,"After that tawny weed; for who can tell,"
16019,BIG BEN,"Before the gathering and the making up,"
16020,BIG BEN,"What alligarta may have spawned thereon_,'"
16021,BIG BEN,Or words to that effect.
16022,BIG BEN,'Magneeficent!'
16023,BIG BEN,"Spluttered the King--'who knows? Who knows, indeed?"
16024,BIG BEN,"That's a grand touch, that Alligarta, Camden!'"
16025,BIG BEN,"'The Scot who wrote those great and splendid words,'"
16026,BIG BEN,"Said Camden, 'languishes in Newgate, sire."
16027,BIG BEN,His ears and nose--'
16028,BIG BEN,"And there, as we arranged"
16029,BIG BEN,"With Inigo Jones, the ladies of the court"
16030,BIG BEN,Assailed the King in tears. Their masque and ball
16031,BIG BEN,"Would all be ruined. All their Grecian robes,"
16032,BIG BEN,"Procured at vast expense, were wasted now."
16033,BIG BEN,The masque was not half-written. Master Jones
16034,BIG BEN,Had lost his poets. They were all in gaol.
16035,BIG BEN,Their noses and their ears ...
16036,BIG BEN,"'God bless my soul,'"
16037,BIG BEN,"Spluttered the King, goggling his eyes again,"
16038,BIG BEN,"'What d'you make of it, Camden?'--"
16039,BIG BEN,'I should say
16040,BIG BEN,"A Puritan plot, sire; for these justices--"
16041,BIG BEN,"Who love tobacco--use their law, it seems,"
16042,BIG BEN,To flout your Majesty at every turn.
16043,BIG BEN,"If this continue, sire, there'll not be left"
16044,BIG BEN,A loyal ear or nose in all your realm.'
16045,BIG BEN,"At that, our noble monarch well-nigh swooned."
16046,BIG BEN,"He hunched his body, padded as it was"
16047,BIG BEN,"Against the assassin's knife, six inches deep"
16048,BIG BEN,"With great green quilts, wagged his enormous head,"
16049,BIG BEN,"Then, in a dozen words, he wooed destruction:"
16050,BIG BEN,'It is presumption and a high contempt
16051,BIG BEN,"In subjects to dispute what kings can do,'"
16052,BIG BEN,He whimpered. 'Even as it is blasphemy
16053,BIG BEN,To thwart the will of God.'
16054,BIG BEN,"He waved his hand,"
16055,BIG BEN,"And rose. 'These men must be released, at once!'"
16056,BIG BEN,"Then, as I think, to seek a safer place,"
16057,BIG BEN,"He waddled from the room, his rickety legs"
16058,BIG BEN,Doubling beneath that great green feather-bed
16059,BIG BEN,He calls his 'person.'--I shall dream to-night
16060,BIG BEN,"Of spiders, Camden.--But in half an hour,"
16061,BIG BEN,Inigo Jones was armed with Right Divine
16062,BIG BEN,To save such ears and noses as the ball
16063,BIG BEN,Required for its perfection. Think of that!
16064,BIG BEN,"And let this earthly ball remember, too,"
16065,BIG BEN,"That Chapman, Marston, and our great big Ben"
16066,BIG BEN,Owe their poor adjuncts to--ten Grecian robes
16067,BIG BEN,And 'Jonson' on tobacco! England loves
16068,BIG BEN,"Her poets, O, supremely, when they're dead."""
16069,BIG BEN,"""But Ben has narrowly escaped her love,"""
16070,BIG BEN,Said Chapman gravely.
16071,BIG BEN,"""What do you mean?"" said Lodge."
16072,BIG BEN,"And, as he spoke, there was a sudden hush."
16073,BIG BEN,"A tall gaunt woman with great burning eyes,"
16074,BIG BEN,And white hair blown back softly from a face
16075,BIG BEN,"Ethereally fierce, as might have looked"
16076,BIG BEN,"Cassandra in old age, stood at the door."
16077,BIG BEN,"""Where is my Ben?"" she said."
16078,BIG BEN,"""Mother!"" cried Ben."
16079,BIG BEN,He rose and caught her in his mighty arms.
16080,BIG BEN,"Her labour-reddened, long-boned hands entwined"
16081,BIG BEN,Behind his neck.
16082,BIG BEN,"""She brought this to the gaol,"""
16083,BIG BEN,"Said Chapman quietly, tossing a phial across"
16084,BIG BEN,"To Camden. ""And he meant to take it, too,"
16085,BIG BEN,Before the hangman touched him. Half an hour
16086,BIG BEN,And you'd have been too late to save big Ben.
16087,BIG BEN,He has lived too much in ancient Rome to love
16088,BIG BEN,A slit nose and the pillory. He'd have wrapped
16089,BIG BEN,His purple round him like an emperor.
16090,BIG BEN,"I think she had another for herself."""
16091,BIG BEN,"""There's Roman blood in both of them,"" said Dekker,"
16092,BIG BEN,"""Don't look. She is weeping now,"" And, while Ben held"
16093,BIG BEN,"That gaunt old body sobbing against his heart,"
16094,BIG BEN,"Dekker, to make her think they paid no heed,"
16095,BIG BEN,Began to sing; and very softly now.
16096,BIG BEN,Full forty voices echoed the refrain:--
16097,BIG BEN,
16098,BIG BEN,"_The Cardinal's Hat_ is a very good inn,"
16099,BIG BEN,And so is _The Puritan's Head_;
16100,BIG BEN,"But I know a sign of a Wine, a Wine"
16101,BIG BEN,That is better when all is said.
16102,BIG BEN,"It is whiter than Venus, redder than Mars,"
16103,BIG BEN,It was old when the world begun;
16104,BIG BEN,For all good inns are moons or stars
16105,BIG BEN,But _The Mermaid_ is their Sun.
16106,BIG BEN,
16107,BIG BEN,"_Chorus:_ They are all alight like moons in the night,"
16108,BIG BEN,But _The Mermaid_ is their Sun.
16109,BIG BEN,
16110,BIG BEN,"Therefore, when priest or parson cries"
16111,BIG BEN,"That inns like flowers increase,"
16112,BIG BEN,"I say that mine inn is a church likewise,"
16113,BIG BEN,"And I say to them ""Be at peace!"""
16114,BIG BEN,An host may gather in dark St. Paul's
16115,BIG BEN,To salve their souls from sin;
16116,BIG BEN,"But the Light may be where ""two or three"""
16117,BIG BEN,Drink Wine in _The Mermaid Inn_.
16118,BIG BEN,
16119,BIG BEN,"_Chorus:_ The Light may be where ""two or three"""
16120,BIG BEN,Drink Wine in _The Mermaid Inn_.

16125,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN
16126,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,
16127,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,'Twas on an All Souls' Eve that our good Inn
16128,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"--Whereof, for ten years now, myself was host--"
16129,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,Heard and took part in its most eerie tale.
16130,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"It was a bitter night, and master Ben,"
16131,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"--His hair now flecked with grey, though youth still fired"
16132,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"His deep and ageless eyes,--in the old oak-chair,"
16133,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"Over the roaring hearth, puffed at his pipe;"
16134,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"A little sad, as often I found him now"
16135,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,Remembering vanished faces. Yet the years
16136,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,Brought others round him. Wreaths of Heliochrise
16137,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"Gleamed still in that great tribe of Benjamin,"
16138,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,Burned still across the malmsey and muscadel.
16139,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"Chapman and Browne, Herrick,--a name like thyme"
16140,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,Crushed into sweetness by a bare-foot maid
16141,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"Milking, at dewy dawn, in Elfin-land,--"
16142,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"These three came late, and sat in a little room"
16143,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"Aside, supping together, on one great pie,"
16144,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,Whereof both crust and coffin were prepared
16145,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"By master Herrick's receipt, and all washed down"
16146,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"With mighty cups of sack. This left with Ben,"
16147,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"John Ford, wrapped in his cloak, brooding aloof,"
16148,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,Drayton and Lodge and Drummond of Hawthornden.
16149,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"Suddenly, in the porch, I heard a sound"
16150,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,Of iron that grated on the flags. A spade
16151,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,And pick came edging through the door.
16152,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,
16153,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"""O, room!"
16154,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"Room for the master-craftsman,"" muttered Ford,"
16155,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,And grey old sexton Scarlet hobbled in.
16156,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"He shuffled off the snow that clogged his boots,"
16157,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,--On my clean rushes!--brushed it from his cloak
16158,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"Of Northern Russet, wiped his rheumatic knees,"
16159,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"Blew out his lanthorn, hung it on a nail,"
16160,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"Leaned his rude pick and spade against the wall,"
16161,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"Flung back his rough frieze hood, flapped his gaunt arms,"
16162,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,And called for ale.
16163,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,
16164,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"""Come to the fire,"" said Lodge."
16165,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"""Room for the wisest counsellor of kings,"
16166,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"The kindly sage that puts us all to bed,"
16167,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"And tucks us up beneath the grass-green quilt."""
16168,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"""Plenty of work, eh Timothy?"" said Ben."
16169,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"""Work? Where's my liquor? O, ay, there's work to spare,"""
16170,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"Old Scarlet croaked, then quaffed his creaming stoup,"
16171,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"While Ben said softly--""Pity you could not spare,"
16172,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"You and your Scythe-man, some of the golden lads"
16173,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"That I have seen here in the Mermaid Inn!"""
16174,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"Then, with a quiet smile he shook his head"
16175,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,And turned to master Drummond of Hawthornden.
16176,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"""Well, songs are good; but flesh and blood are better."
16177,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,The grey old tomb of Horace glows for me
16178,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"Across the centuries, with one little fire"
16179,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"Lit by a girl's light hand."" Then, under breath,"
16180,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,"Yet with some passion, he murmured this brief rhyme:--"
16181,THE BURIAL OF A QUEEN,
16182,I,I
16183,I,
16184,I,"_Dulce ridentem_, laughing through the ages,"
16185,I,"_Dulce loquentem_, O, fairer far to me,"
16186,I,Rarer than the wisdom of all his golden pages
16187,I,Floats the happy laughter of his vanished Lalage.
16188,I,
16189,II,II
16190,II,
16191,II,"_Dulce loquentem_,--we hear it and we know it."
16192,II,"_Dulce ridentem_,--so musical and low."
16193,II,"""Mightier than marble is my song!"" Ah, did the poet"
16194,II,Know why little Lalage was mightier even so?
16195,II,
16196,III,III
16197,III,
16198,III,"_Dulce ridentem_,--through all the years that sever,"
16199,III,"Clear as o'er yon hawthorn hedge we heard her passing by,--"
16200,III,"_Lalagen amabo_,--a song may live for ever"
16201,III,"_Dulce loquentem_,--but Lalage must die."
16202,III,
16203,III,"""I'd like to learn that rhyme,"" the sexton said."
16204,III,"""I've a fine memory too. You start me now,"
16205,III,"I'd keep it up all night with ancient ballads."""
16206,III,And then--a strange thing happened. I saw John Ford
16207,III,"""With folded arms and melancholy hat"""
16208,III,(As in our Mermaid jest he still would sit)
16209,III,Watching old Scarlet like a man in trance.
16210,III,"The sexton gulped his ale and smacked his lips,"
16211,III,"Then croaked again--""O, ay, there's work to spare,"
16212,III,"We fills 'em faster than the spades can dig,"""
16213,III,"And, all at once, the lights burned low and blue."
16214,III,"Ford leaned right forward, with his grim black eyes"
16215,III,Widening.
16216,III,
16217,III,"""Why, that's a marvellous ring!"" he said,"
16218,III,And pointed to the sexton's gnarled old hand
16219,III,Spread on the black oak-table like the claw
16220,III,"Of some great bird of prey. ""A ruby worth"
16221,III,"The ransom of a queen!"" The fire leapt up!"
16222,III,The sexton stared at him;
16223,III,"Then stretched his hand out, with its blue-black nails,"
16224,III,"Full in the light, a grim earth-coloured hand,"
16225,III,But bare as it was born.
16226,III,
16227,III,"""There was a ring!"
16228,III,"I could have sworn it! Red as blood!"" cried Ford."
16229,III,And Ben and Lodge and Drummond of Hawthornden
16230,III,All stared at him. For such a silent soul
16231,III,"Was master Ford that, when he suddenly spake,"
16232,III,It struck the rest as dumb as if the Sphinx
16233,III,Had opened its cold stone lips. He would sit mute
16234,III,"Brooding, aloof, for hours, his cloak around him,"
16235,III,"A staff between his knees, as if prepared"
16236,III,"For a long journey, a lonely pilgrimage"
16237,III,"To some dark tomb; a strange and sorrowful soul,"
16238,III,"Yet not--as many thought him--harsh or hard,"
16239,III,But of a most kind patience. Though he wrote
16240,III,"In blood, they say, the blood came from his heart;"
16241,III,And all the sufferings of this world he took
16242,III,"To his own soul, and bade them pasture there:"
16243,III,"Till out of his compassion, he became"
16244,III,A monument of bitterness. He rebelled;
16245,III,And so fell short of that celestial height
16246,III,"Whereto the greatest only climb, who stand"
16247,III,"By Shakespeare, and accept the Eternal Law."
16248,III,"These find, in law, firm footing for the soul,"
16249,III,"The strength that binds the stars, and reins the sea,"
16250,III,"The base of being, the pillars of the world,"
16251,III,"The pledge of honour, the pure cord of love,"
16252,III,"The form of truth, the golden floors of heaven."
16253,III,"These men discern a height beyond all heights,"
16254,III,"A depth below all depths, and never an end"
16255,III,"Without a pang beyond it, and a hope;"
16256,III,"Without a heaven beyond it, and a hell."
16257,III,"For these, despair is like a bubble pricked,"
16258,III,An old romance to make young lovers weep.
16259,III,"For these, the law becomes a fiery road,"
16260,III,A Jacob's ladder through that vast abyss
16261,III,"Lacking no rung from realm to loftier realm,"
16262,III,Nor wanting one degree from dust to wings.
16263,III,"These, at the last, radiant with victory,"
16264,III,Lay their strong hands upon the wingèd steeds
16265,III,"And fiery chariots, and exult to hold,"
16266,III,"Themselves, the throbbing reins, whereby they steer"
16267,III,The stormy splendours.
16268,III,"He, being less, rebelled,"
16269,III,"Cried out for unreined steeds, and unruled stars,"
16270,III,An unprohibited ocean and a truth
16271,III,Untrue; and the equal thunder of the law
16272,III,"Hurled him to night and chaos, who was born"
16273,III,To shine upon the forehead of the day.
16274,III,And yet--the voice of darkness and despair
16275,III,"May speak for heaven where heaven would not be heard,"
16276,III,"May fight for heaven where heaven would not prevail,"
16277,III,"And the consummate splendour of that strife,"
16278,III,"Swallowing up all discords, all defeat,"
16279,III,"In one huge victory, harmonising all,"
16280,III,"Make Lucifer, at last, at one with God."
16281,III,
16282,III,"There,--on that All Souls' Eve, you might have thought"
16283,III,"A dead man spoke, to see how Drayton stared,"
16284,III,And Drummond started.
16285,III,"""You saw no ruby ring,"""
16286,III,"The old sexton muttered sullenly. ""If you did,"
16287,III,"The worse for me, by all accounts. The lights"
16288,III,Burned low. You caught the firelight on my fist.
16289,III,"What was it like, this ring?"""
16290,III,"""A band of gold,"
16291,III,"And a great ruby, heart-shaped, fit to burn"
16292,III,Between the breasts of Laïs. Am I awake
16293,III,"Or dreaming?"""
16294,III,"""Well,--that makes the second time!"
16295,III,"There's many have said they saw it, out of jest,"
16296,III,To scare me. For the astrologer did say
16297,III,"The third time I should die. Now, did you see it?"
16298,III,Most likely someone's told you that old tale!
16299,III,"You hadn't heard it, now?"""
16300,III,Ford shook his head.
16301,III,"""What tale?"" said Ben."
16302,III,"""O, you could make a book"
16303,III,"About my life. I've talked with quick and dead,"
16304,III,And neither ghost nor flesh can fright me now!
16305,III,"I wish it was a ring, so's I could catch him,"
16306,III,And sell him; but I've never seen him yet.
16307,III,"A white witch told me, if I did, I'd go"
16308,III,"Clink, just like that, to heaven or t'other place,"
16309,III,Whirled in a fiery chariot with ten steeds
16310,III,The way Elijah went. For I have seen
16311,III,So many mighty things that I must die
16312,III,Mightily.
16313,III,"Well,--I came, sirs, to my craft"
16314,III,The day mine uncle Robert dug the grave
16315,III,"For good Queen Katharine, she whose heart was broke"
16316,III,"By old King Harry, a very great while ago."
16317,III,"Maybe you've heard about my uncle, sirs?"
16318,III,He was far-famous for his grave-digging.
16319,III,"In depth, in speed, in neatness, he'd no match!"
16320,III,They've put a fine slab to his memory
16321,III,"In Peterborough Cathedral--_Robert Scarlet,"
16322,III,"Sexton for half a century_, it says,"
16323,III,"_In Peterborough Cathedral, where he built"
16324,III,"The last sad habitation for two queens,"
16325,III,And many hundreds of the common sort.
16326,III,"And now himself, who for so many built"
16327,III,"Eternal habitations, others have buried._"
16328,III,"_Obiit anno ætatis, ninety-eight,"
16329,III,"July the second, fifteen ninety-four._"
16330,III,"We should do well, sir, with a slab like that,"
16331,III,"Shouldn't we?"" And the sexton leered at Lodge."
16332,III,"""Not many boasts a finer slab than that."
16333,III,"There's many a king done worse. Ah, well, you see,"
16334,III,"He'd a fine record. Living to ninety-eight,"
16335,III,"He buried generations of the poor,"
16336,III,"A countless host, and thought no more of it"
16337,III,Than digging potatoes. He'd a lofty mind
16338,III,That found no satisfaction in small deeds.
16339,III,But from his burying of two queens he drew
16340,III,"A lively pleasure. Could he have buried a third,"
16341,III,It would indeed have crowned his old white hairs.
16342,III,"But he was famous, and he thought, perchance,"
16343,III,A third were mere vain-glory. So he died.
16344,III,"I helped him with the second."""
16345,III,The old man leered
16346,III,To see the shaft go home.
16347,III,Ben filled the stoup
16348,III,"With ale. ""So that,"" quoth he, ""began the tale"
16349,III,"About this ruby ring?"" ""But who,"" said Lodge,"
16350,III,"""Who was the second queen?"""
16351,III,"""A famous queen,"
16352,III,"And a great lover! When you hear her name,"
16353,III,Your hearts will leap. Her beauty passed the bounds
16354,III,"Of modesty, men say, yet--she died young!"
16355,III,We buried her at midnight. There were few
16356,III,That knew it; for the high State Funeral
16357,III,"Was held upon the morrow, Lammas morn."
16358,III,"Anon you shall hear why. A strange thing that,--"
16359,III,To see the mourners weeping round a hearse
16360,III,That held a dummy coffin. Stranger still
16361,III,To see us lowering the true coffin down
16362,III,"By torchlight, with some few of her true friends,"
16363,III,"In Peterborough Cathedral, all alone."""
16364,III,"""Old as the world,"" said Ford. ""It is the way"
16365,III,Of princes. Their true tears and smiles are seen
16366,III,"At dead of night, like ghosts raised from the grave!"
16367,III,"And all the luxury of their brief, bright noon,"
16368,III,"Cloaks but a dummy throne, a mask of life;"
16369,III,"And, at the last, drapes a false catafalque,"
16370,III,"Holding a vacant urn, a mask of death."
16371,III,"But tell, tell on!"""
16372,III,The sexton took a draught
16373,III,Of ale and smacked his lips.
16374,III,"""Mine uncle lived"
16375,III,"A mile or more from Peterborough, then."
16376,III,"And, past his cottage, in the dead of night,"
16377,III,"Her royal coach came creeping through the lanes,"
16378,III,"With scutcheons round it and no crowd to see,"
16379,III,"And heralds carrying torches in their hands,"
16380,III,"And none to admire, but him and me, and one,"
16381,III,"A pedlar-poet, who lodged with us that week"
16382,III,And paid his lodging with a bunch of rhymes.
16383,III,"By these, he said, my uncle Robert's fame"
16384,III,"Should live, as in a picture, till the crack"
16385,III,Of doom. My uncle thought that he should pay
16386,III,"Four-pence beside; but, when the man declared"
16387,III,"The thought unworthy of these august events,"
16388,III,My uncle was abashed.
16389,III,"And, truth to tell,"
16390,III,"The rhymes were mellow, though here and there he swerved"
16391,III,From truth to make them so. Nor would he change
16392,III,'June' to 'July' for all that we could say.
16393,III,"'I never said the month was June,' he cried,"
16394,III,"'And if I did, Shakespeare hath jumped an age!"
16395,III,"Gods, will you hedge me round with thirty nights?"
16396,III,"""June"" rhymes with ""moon""!' With that, he flung them down"
16397,III,"And strode away like Lucifer, and was gone,"
16398,III,Before old Scarlet could approach again
16399,III,The matter of that four-pence.
16400,III,Yet his rhymes
16401,III,Have caught the very colours of that night!
16402,III,"I can see through them,"
16403,III,"Ay, just as through our cottage window-panes,"
16404,III,"Can see the great black coach,"
16405,III,Carrying the dead queen past our garden-gate.
16406,III,"The roses bobbing and fluttering to and fro,"
16407,III,"Hide, and yet show the more by hiding, half."
16408,III,"And, like smoked glass through which you see the sun,"
16409,III,The song shows truest when it blurs the truth.
16410,III,"This is the way it goes."""
16411,III,"He rose to his feet,"
16412,III,"Picked up his spade, and struck an attitude,"
16413,III,"Leaning upon it. ""I've got to feel my spade,"
16414,III,Or I'll forget it. This is the way I speak it.
16415,III,"Always."" And, with a schoolboy's rigid face,"
16416,III,"And eyes fixed on the rafters, he began,"
16417,III,"Sing-song, the pedlar-poet's bunch of rhymes:--"
16418,III,
16419,III,As I went by the cattle-shed
16420,III,"The grey dew dimmed the grass,"
16421,III,"And, under a twisted apple-tree,"
16422,III,Old Robin Scarlet stood by me.
16423,III,"""Keep watch! Keep watch to-night,"" he said,"
16424,III,"""There's things 'ull come to pass."
16425,III,
16426,III,"""Keep watch until the moon has cleared"
16427,III,The thatch of yonder rick;
16428,III,Then I'll come out of my cottage-door
16429,III,To wait for the coach of a queen once more;
16430,III,"And--you'll say nothing of what you've heard,"
16431,III,"But rise and follow me quick."""
16432,III,
16433,III,"""And what 'ull I see if I keep your trust,"
16434,III,"And wait and watch so late?"""
16435,III,"""Pride,"" he said, ""and Pomp,"" he said,"
16436,III,"""Beauty to haunt you till you're dead,"
16437,III,"And Glorious Dust that goes to dust,"
16438,III,Passing the white farm-gate.
16439,III,
16440,III,"""You are young and all for adventure, lad,"
16441,III,And the great tales to be told:
16442,III,"This night, before the clock strike one,"
16443,III,Your lordliest hour will all be done;
16444,III,"But you'll remember it and be glad,"
16445,III,"In the days when you are old!"""
16446,III,
16447,III,"All in the middle of the night,"
16448,III,My face was at the pane;
16449,III,"When, creeping out of his cottage-door,"
16450,III,"To wait for the coach of a queen once more,"
16451,III,"Old Scarlet, in the moon-light,"
16452,III,Beckoned to me again.
16453,III,
16454,III,"He stood beneath a lilac-spray,"
16455,III,"Like Father Time for dole,"
16456,III,"In Reading Tawny cloak and hood,"
16457,III,"With mattock and with spade he stood,"
16458,III,"And, far away to southward,"
16459,III,A bell began to toll.
16460,III,
16461,III,"He stood beneath a lilac-spray,"
16462,III,And never a word he said;
16463,III,"But, as I stole out of the house,"
16464,III,"He pointed over the orchard boughs,"
16465,III,"Where, not with dawn or sunset,"
16466,III,The Northern sky grew red.
16467,III,
16468,III,"I followed him, and half in fear,"
16469,III,To the old farm-gate again;
16470,III,"And, round the curve of the long white road,"
16471,III,I saw that the dew-dashed hedges glowed
16472,III,"Red with the grandeur drawing near,"
16473,III,And the torches of her train.
16474,III,
16475,III,"They carried her down with singing,"
16476,III,"With singing sweet and low,"
16477,III,"Slowly round the curve they came,"
16478,III,"Twenty torches dropping flame,"
16479,III,The heralds that were bringing her
16480,III,The way we all must go.
16481,III,
16482,III,"'Twas master William Dethick,"
16483,III,"The Garter King of Arms,"
16484,III,"Before her royal coach did ride,"
16485,III,"With none to see his Coat of Pride,"
16486,III,"For peace was on the countryside,"
16487,III,And sleep upon the farms;
16488,III,
16489,III,"Peace upon the red farm,"
16490,III,"Peace upon the grey,"
16491,III,"Peace on the heavy orchard trees,"
16492,III,"And little white-walled cottages,"
16493,III,"Peace upon the wayside,"
16494,III,And sleep upon the way.
16495,III,
16496,III,"So master William Dethick,"
16497,III,"With forty horse and men,"
16498,III,Like any common man and mean
16499,III,"Rode on before the Queen, the Queen,"
16500,III,And--only a wandering pedlar
16501,III,Could tell the tale again.
16502,III,
16503,III,"How, like a cloud of darkness,"
16504,III,Between the torches moved
16505,III,Four black steeds and a velvet pall
16506,III,Crowned with the Crown Imperiall
16507,III,"And--on her shield--the lilies,"
16508,III,The lilies that she loved.
16509,III,
16510,III,"Ah, stained and ever stainless"
16511,III,"Ah, white as her own hand,"
16512,III,"White as the wonder of that brow,"
16513,III,"Crowned with colder lilies now,"
16514,III,"White on the velvet darkness,"
16515,III,The lilies of her land!
16516,III,
16517,III,"The witch from over the water,"
16518,III,"The fay from over the foam,"
16519,III,The bride that rode thro' Edinbro' town
16520,III,"With satin shoes and a silken gown,"
16521,III,"A queen, and a great king's daughter,--"
16522,III,"Thus they carried her home,"
16523,III,
16524,III,"With torches and with scutcheons,"
16525,III,"Unhonoured and unseen,"
16526,III,"With the lilies of France in the wind a-stir,"
16527,III,"And the Lion of Scotland over her,"
16528,III,"Darkly, in the dead of night,"
16529,III,"They carried the Queen, the Queen."
16530,III,
16531,III,The sexton paused and took a draught of ale.
16532,III,"""'Twas there,"" he said, ""I joined 'em at the gate,"
16533,III,"My uncle and the pedlar. What they sang,"
16534,III,The little shadowy throng of men that walked
16535,III,Behind the scutcheoned coach with bare bent heads
16536,III,I know not; but 'twas very soft and low.
16537,III,"They walked behind the rest, like shadows flung"
16538,III,"Behind the torch-light, from that strange dark hearse."
16539,III,"And, some said, afterwards, they were the ghosts"
16540,III,Of lovers that this queen had brought to death.
16541,III,"A foolish thought it seemed to me, and yet"
16542,III,Like the night-wind they sang. And there was one
16543,III,"An olive-coloured man,--the pedlar said"
16544,III,"Was like a certain foreigner that she loved,"
16545,III,"One Chastelard, a wild French poet of hers."
16546,III,Also the pedlar thought they sang 'farewell'
16547,III,"In words like this, and that the words in French"
16548,III,"Were written by the hapless Queen herself,"
16549,III,When as a girl she left the vines of France
16550,III,For Scotland and the halls of Holyrood:--
16551,III,
16552,I,I
16553,I,
16554,I,Though thy hands have plied their trade
16555,I,"Eighty years without a rest,"
16556,I,"Robin Scarlet, never thy spade"
16557,I,Built a house for such a guest!
16558,I,"Carry her where, in earliest June,"
16559,I,All the whitest hawthorns blow;
16560,I,"Carry her under the midnight moon,"
16561,I,Singing very soft and low.
16562,I,"Slow between the low green larches, carry the lovely lady sleeping,"
16563,I,"Past the low white moon-lit farms, along the lilac-shadowed way!"
16564,I,"Carry her through the summer darkness, weeping, weeping, weeping, weeping!"
16565,I,"Answering only, to any that ask you, whence ye carry her,--_Fotheringhay!_"
16566,I,
16567,II,II
16568,II,
16569,II,She was gayer than a child!
16570,II,--_Let your torches droop for sorrow._--
16571,II,Laughter in her eyes ran wild!
16572,II,--_Carry her down to Peterboro'._--
16573,II,Words were kisses in her mouth!
16574,II,--_Let no word of blame be spoken._--
16575,II,She was Queen of all the South!
16576,II,"--_In the North, her heart was broken._--"
16577,II,"They should have left her in her vineyards, left her heart to her"
16578,II,"land's own keeping,"
16579,II,"Left her white breast room to breathe, and left her light foot free"
16580,II,to dance.
16581,II,"Out of the cold grey Northern mists, we carry her weeping,"
16582,II,"weeping, weeping,--"
16583,II,"_O, ma patrie,"
16584,II,"La plus chérie,"
16585,II,"Adieu, plaisant pays de France!_"
16586,II,
16587,II,
16588,III,III
16589,III,
16590,III,Many a red heart died to beat
16591,III,--_Music swelled in Holyrood!_--
16592,III,"Once, beneath her fair white feet."
16593,III,--_Now the floors may rot with blood_--
16594,III,She was young and her deep hair--
16595,III,--_Wind and rain were all her fate!_--
16596,III,"Trapped young Love as in a snare,"
16597,III,--_And the wind's a sword in the Canongate!
16598,III,Edinboro'!
16599,III,Edinboro'!
16600,III,"Music built the towers of Troy, but thy grey walls are built of sorrow!_"
16601,III,"Wind-swept hills, and sorrowful glens, of thrifty sowing and iron reaping,"
16602,III,"What if her foot were fair as a sunbeam, how should it touch or"
16603,III,melt your snows?
16604,III,What if her hair were a silken mesh?
16605,III,"Hands of steel can deal hard blows,"
16606,III,Iron breast-plates bruise fair flesh!
16607,III,"Carry her southward, palled in purple,"
16608,III,"Weeping, weeping, weeping, weeping,"
16609,III,What had their rocks to do with roses? Body and soul she was all one rose.
16610,III,
16611,III,"Thus, through the summer night, slowly they went,"
16612,III,"We three behind,--the pedlar-poet and I,"
16613,III,And Robin Scarlet. The moving flare that ringed
16614,III,"The escutcheoned hearse, lit every leaf distinct"
16615,III,"Along the hedges and woke the sleeping birds,"
16616,III,But drew no watchers from the drowsier farms.
16617,III,"Thus, through a world of innocence and sleep,"
16618,III,"We brought her to the doors of her last home,"
16619,III,In Peterborough Cathedral. Round her tomb
16620,III,"They stood, in the huge gloom of those old aisles,"
16621,III,"The heralds with their torches, but their light"
16622,III,Struggled in vain with that tremendous dark.
16623,III,Their ring of smoky red could only show
16624,III,"A few sad faces round the purple pall,"
16625,III,"The wings of a stone angel overhead,"
16626,III,"The base of three great pillars, and, fitfully,"
16627,III,"Faint as the phosphorus glowing in some old vault,"
16628,III,"One little slab of marble, far away."
16629,III,"Yet, or the darkness, or the pedlar's words"
16630,III,"Had made me fanciful, I thought I saw"
16631,III,"Bowed shadows praying in those unplumbed aisles,"
16632,III,"Nay, dimly heard them weeping, in a grief"
16633,III,"That still was built of silence, like the drip"
16634,III,Of water from a frozen fountain-head.
16635,III,We laid her in her grave. We closed the tomb.
16636,III,With echoing footsteps all the funeral went;
16637,III,And I went last to close and lock the doors;
16638,III,"Last, and half frightened of the enormous gloom"
16639,III,That rolled along behind me as one by one
16640,III,"The torches vanished. O, I was glad to see"
16641,III,The moonlight on the kind turf-mounds again.
16642,III,"But, as I turned the key, a quivering hand"
16643,III,Was laid upon my arm. I turned and saw
16644,III,That foreigner with the olive-coloured face.
16645,III,"From head to foot he shivered, as with cold."
16646,III,He drew me into the shadows of the porch.
16647,III,"'Come back with me,' he whispered, and slid his hand"
16648,III,"--Like ice it was!--along my wrist, and slipped"
16649,III,"A ring upon my finger, muttering quick,"
16650,III,"As in a burning fever, 'All the wealth"
16651,III,Of Eldorado for one hour! Come back!
16652,III,I must go back and see her face again!
16653,III,"I was not there, not there, the day she--died."
16654,III,You'll help me with the coffin. Not a soul
16655,III,"Will know. Come back! One moment, only one!'"
16656,III,"I thought the man was mad, and plucked my hand"
16657,III,"Away from him. He caught me by the sleeve,"
16658,III,"And sank upon his knees, lifting his face"
16659,III,Most piteously to mine. 'One moment! See!
16660,III,I loved her!'
16661,III,"I saw the moonlight glisten on his tears,"
16662,III,"Great, long, slow tears they were; and then--my God--"
16663,III,As his face lifted and his head sank back
16664,III,Beseeching me--I saw a crimson thread
16665,III,"Circling his throat, as though the headsman's axe"
16666,III,"Had cloven it with one blow, so shrewd, so keen,"
16667,III,The head had slipped not from the trunk.
16668,III,I gasped;
16669,III,"And, as he pleaded, stretching his head back,"
16670,III,"The wound, O like a second awful mouth,"
16671,III,The wound began to gape.
16672,III,I tore my cloak
16673,III,Out of his clutch. My keys fell with a clash.
16674,III,"I left them where they lay, and with a shout"
16675,III,I dashed into the broad white empty road.
16676,III,There was no soul in sight. Sweating with fear
16677,III,"I hastened home, not daring to look back;"
16678,III,"But as I turned the corner, I heard the clang"
16679,III,"Of those great doors, and knew he had entered in."
16680,III,
16681,III,Not till I saw before me in the lane
16682,III,The pedlar and my uncle did I halt
16683,III,And look at that which clasped my finger still
16684,III,As with a band of ice.
16685,III,My hand was bare!
16686,III,I stared at it and rubbed it. Then I thought
16687,III,I had been dreaming. There had been no ring!
16688,III,"The poor man I had left there in the porch,"
16689,III,"Being a Frenchman, talked a little wild;"
16690,III,But only wished to look upon her grave.
16691,III,And I--I was the madman! So I said
16692,III,"Nothing. But all the same, for all my thoughts,"
16693,III,"I'd not go back that night to find the keys,"
16694,III,"No, not for all the rubies in the crown"
16695,III,Of Prester John.
16696,III,
16697,III,*   *   *   *
16698,III,
16699,III,The high State Funeral
16700,III,Was held on Lammas Day. A wondrous sight
16701,III,"For Peterborough! For myself, I found"
16702,III,Small satisfaction in a catafalque
16703,III,"That carried a dummy coffin. None the less,"
16704,III,"The pedlar thought that as a Solemn Masque,"
16705,III,"Or Piece of Purple Pomp, the thing was good,"
16706,III,And worthy of a picture in his rhymes;
16707,III,The more because he said it shadowed forth
16708,III,The ironic face of Death.
16709,III,"The Masque, indeed"
16710,III,Began before we buried her. For a host
16711,III,Of Mourners--Lords and Ladies--on Lammas eve
16712,III,"Panting with eagerness of pride and place,"
16713,III,"Arrived in readiness for the morrow's pomp,"
16714,III,And at the Bishop's Palace they found prepared
16715,III,"A mighty supper for them, where they sat"
16716,III,All at one table. In a Chamber hung
16717,III,"With 'scutcheons and black cloth, they drank red wine"
16718,III,"And feasted, while the torches and the Queen"
16719,III,Crept through the darkness of Northampton lanes.
16720,III,
16721,III,"At seven o'clock on Lammas Morn they woke,"
16722,III,After the Queen was buried; and at eight
16723,III,"The Masque set forth, thus pictured in the rhymes"
16724,III,"With tolling bells, which on the pedlar's lips"
16725,III,"Had more than paid his lodging: Thus he spake it,"
16726,III,"Slowly, sounding the rhymes like solemn bells,"
16727,III,"And tolling, in between, with lingering tongue:--"
16728,III,
16729,III,"_Toll!_--From the Palace the Releevants creep,--"
16730,III,"A hundred poor old women, nigh their end,"
16731,III,"Wearing their black cloth gowns, and on each head"
16732,III,"An ell of snow-white holland which, some said,"
16733,III,"Afterwards they might keep,"
16734,III,"--_Ah, Toll!_--with nine new shillings each to spend,"
16735,III,"For all the trouble that they had, and all"
16736,III,The sorrow of walking to this funeral.
16737,III,
16738,III,_Toll!_--And the Mourning Cloaks in purple streamed
16739,III,"Following, a long procession, two by two,"
16740,III,"Her Household first. With these, Monsieur du Preau"
16741,III,"Her French Confessor, unafraid to show"
16742,III,The golden Cross that gleamed
16743,III,"About his neck, warned what the crowd might do"
16744,III,"Said _I will wear it, though I die for it!_"
16745,III,So subtle in malice was that Jesuit.
16746,III,
16747,III,_Toll!_--Sir George Savile in his Mourner's Gown
16748,III,Carried the solemn Cross upon a Field
16749,III,"Azure, and under it by a streamer borne"
16750,III,"Upon a field of Gules, an Unicorn"
16751,III,"Argent and, lower down,"
16752,III,"A scrolled device upon a blazoned shield,"
16753,III,Which seemed to say--I AM SILENT TILL THE END!--
16754,III,"_Toll! Toll!_--IN MY DEFENCE, GOD ME DEFEND!"
16755,III,
16756,III,"_Toll!_--and a hundred poor old men went by,"
16757,III,"Followed by two great Bishops.--_Toll, ah toll!_--"
16758,III,"Then, with White Staves and Gowns, four noble lords;"
16759,III,Then sixteen Scots and Frenchmen with drawn swords;
16760,III,"Then, with a Bannerol,"
16761,III,"Sir Andrew Noel, lifting to the sky"
16762,III,The Great Red Lion. Then the Crown and Crest
16763,III,Borne by a Herald on his glittering breast.
16764,III,
16765,III,"And now--ah now, indeed, the deep bell tolls--"
16766,III,"That empty Coffin, with its velvet pall,"
16767,III,"Borne by six Gentlemen, under a canopy"
16768,III,"Of purple, lifted by four knights, goes by."
16769,III,
16770,III,The Crown Imperial
16771,III,Burns on the Coffin-head. Four Bannerols
16772,III,"On either side, uplifted by four squires,"
16773,III,Roll on the wind their rich heraldic fires.
16774,III,_Toll!_ The Chief Mourner--the fair Russell!--_toll!_--
16775,III,"Countess of Bedford--_toll!_--they bring her now,"
16776,III,"Weeping under a purple Cloth of State,"
16777,III,"Till, halting there before the Minister Gate,"
16778,III,Having in her control
16779,III,"The fair White Staves of office, with a bow"
16780,III,"She gives them to her two great Earls again,"
16781,III,Then sweeps them onward in her mournful train.
16782,III,
16783,III,_Toll!_ At the high Cathedral door the Quires
16784,III,"Meet them and lead them, singing all the while"
16785,III,A mighty _Miserere_ for her soul!
16786,III,"Then, as the rolling organ--_toll, ah toll!_--"
16787,III,Floods every glimmering aisle
16788,III,"With ocean-thunders, all those knights and squires"
16789,III,Bring the false Coffin to the central nave
16790,III,And set it in the Catafalque o'er her grave.
16791,III,
16792,III,The Catafalque was made in Field-bed wise
16793,III,"Valanced with midnight purple, fringed with gold:"
16794,III,All the Chief Mourners on dark thrones were set
16795,III,"Within it, as jewels in some huge carcanet:"
16796,III,Above was this device
16797,III,"IN MY DEFENCE, GOD ME DEFEND, inscrolled"
16798,III,"Round the rich Arms of Scotland, as to say"
16799,III,"""Man judged me. I abide the Judgment Day."""
16800,III,
16801,III,"The sexton paused anew. All looked at him,"
16802,III,"And at his wrinkled, grim, earth-coloured hand,"
16803,III,"As if, in that dim light, beclouded now"
16804,III,"With blue tobacco-smoke, they thought to see"
16805,III,The smouldering ruby again.
16806,III,"""Ye know,"" he said,"
16807,III,"""How master William Wickham preached that day?"""
16808,III,"Ford nodded. ""I have heard of it. He showed"
16809,III,"Subtly, O very subtly, after his kind,"
16810,III,That the white Body of Beauty such as hers
16811,III,"Was in itself Papistical, a feast,"
16812,III,"A fast, an incense, a burnt-offering,"
16813,III,And an Abomination in the sight
16814,III,"Of all true Protestants. Why, her very name"
16815,III,"Was Mary!"""
16816,III,"""Ay, that's true, that's very true!"""
16817,III,"The sexton mused. ""Now that's a strange deep thought!"
16818,III,The Bishop missed a text in missing that.
16819,III,"Her name, indeed, was Mary!"""
16820,III,"""Did you find"
16821,III,"Your keys again?"" ""Ay, Sir, I found them!"" ""Where?"""
16822,III,"""Strange you should ask me that! After the throng"
16823,III,"Departed, and the Nobles were at feast,"
16824,III,All in the Bishop's Palace--a great feast
16825,III,And worthy of their sorrow--I came back
16826,III,Carrying my uncle's second bunch of keys
16827,III,"To lock the doors and search, too, for mine own."
16828,III,"'Twas growing dusk already, and as I thrust"
16829,III,"The key into the lock, the great grey porch"
16830,III,"Grew cold upon me, like a tomb."
16831,III,I pushed
16832,III,Hard at the key--then stopped--with all my flesh
16833,III,"Freezing, and half in mind to fly; for, sirs,"
16834,III,"The door was locked already, and--_from within_!"
16835,III,I drew the key forth quietly and stepped back
16836,III,"Into the Churchyard, where the graves were warm"
16837,III,"With sunset still, and the blunt carven stones"
16838,III,"Lengthened their homely shadows, out and out,"
16839,III,"To Everlasting. Then I plucked up heart,"
16840,III,Seeing the footprints of that mighty Masque
16841,III,Along the pebbled path. A queer thought came
16842,III,Into my head that all the world without
16843,III,"Was but a Masque, and I was creeping back,"
16844,III,Back from the Mourner's Feast to Truth again.
16845,III,"Yet--I grew bold, and tried the Southern door."
16846,III,"'Twas locked, but held no key on the inner side"
16847,III,"To foil my own, and softly, softly, click,"
16848,III,"I turned it, and with heart, sirs, in my mouth,"
16849,III,Pushed back the studded door and entered in ...
16850,III,"Stepped straight out of the world, I might have said,"
16851,III,"Out of the dusk into a night so deep,"
16852,III,"So dark, I trembled like a child...."
16853,III,And then
16854,III,"I was aware, sirs, of a great sweet wave"
16855,III,"Of incense. All the gloom was heavy with it,"
16856,III,As if her Papist Household had returned
16857,III,"To pray for her poor soul; and, my fear went."
16858,III,"But either that strange incense weighed me down,"
16859,III,"Or else from being sorely over-tasked,"
16860,III,"A languor came upon me, and sitting there"
16861,III,"To breathe a moment, in a velvet stall,"
16862,III,I closed mine eyes.
16863,III,"A moment, and no more,"
16864,III,"For then I heard a rustling in the nave,"
16865,III,"And opened them; and, very far away,"
16866,III,"As if across the world, in Rome herself,"
16867,III,"I saw twelve tapers in the solemn East,"
16868,III,"And saw, or thought I saw, cowled figures kneel"
16869,III,"Before them, in an incense-cloud."
16870,III,"And then,"
16871,III,Maybe the sunset deepened in the world
16872,III,Of masques without--clear proof that I had closed
16873,III,"Mine eyes but for a moment, sirs, I saw"
16874,III,"As if across a world-without-end tomb,"
16875,III,A tiny jewelled glow of crimson panes
16876,III,Darkening and brightening with the West.
16877,III,"And then,"
16878,III,"Then I saw something more--Queen Mary's vault,"
16879,III,And--it was open!...
16880,III,"Then, I heard a voice,"
16881,III,"A strange deep broken voice, whispering love"
16882,III,"In soft French words, that clasped and clung like hands;"
16883,III,"And then--two shadows passed against the West,"
16884,III,"Two blurs of black against that crimson stain,"
16885,III,"Slowly, O very slowly, with bowed heads,"
16886,III,"Leaning together, and vanished into the dark"
16887,III,Beyond the Catafalque.
16888,III,"Then--I heard him pray,--"
16889,III,"And knew him for the man that prayed to me,--"
16890,III,Pray as a man prays for his love's last breath!
16891,III,"And then, O sirs, it caught me by the throat,"
16892,III,"And I, too, dropped upon my knees and prayed;"
16893,III,"For, as in answer to his prayer, there came"
16894,III,"A moan of music, a mighty shuddering sound"
16895,III,"From the great organ, a sound that rose and fell"
16896,III,"Like seas in anger, very far away;"
16897,III,"And then a peal of thunder, and then it seemed,"
16898,III,"As if the graves were giving up their dead,"
16899,III,A great cowled host of shadows rose and sang;--
16900,III,
16901,III,"_Dies iræ, dies illâ"
16902,III,"Solvet sæclum in favilla,"
16903,III,Teste David cum Sibylla._
16904,III,
16905,III,"I heard her sad, sad, little, broken voice,"
16906,III,"Out in the darkness. 'Ay, and David, too,"
16907,III,"His blood is on the floors of Holyrood,"
16908,III,To speak for me.' Then that great ocean-sound
16909,III,"Swelled to a thunder again, and heaven and earth"
16910,III,Shrivelled away; and in that huge slow hymn
16911,III,"Chariots were driven forth in flaming rows,"
16912,III,And terrible trumpets blown from deep to deep.
16913,III,
16914,III,"And then, ah then, the heart of heaven was hushed,"
16915,III,"And--in the hush--it seemed an angel wept,"
16916,III,"Another Mary wept, and gathering up"
16917,III,"All our poor wounded, weary, way-worn world,"
16918,III,"Even as a Mother gathers up her babe,"
16919,III,"Soothed it against her breast, and rained her tears"
16920,III,"On the pierced feet of God, and melted Him"
16921,III,"To pity, and over His feet poured her deep hair."
16922,III,The music died away. The shadows knelt.
16923,III,"And then--I heard a rustling nigh the tomb,"
16924,III,"And heard--and heard--or dreamed I heard--farewells,"
16925,III,"Farewells for everlasting, deep farewells,"
16926,III,"Bitter as blood, darker than any death."
16927,III,"And, at the last, as in a kiss, one breath,"
16928,III,"One agony of sweetness, like a sword"
16929,III,"For sharpness, drawn along a soft white throat;"
16930,III,"And, for its terrible sweetness, like a sigh"
16931,III,"Across great waters, very far away,--"
16932,III,_Sweetheart!_
16933,III,
16934,III,"And then, like doors, like world-without-end doors"
16935,III,"That shut for Everlasting, came a clang,"
16936,III,"And ringing, echoing, through the echo of it,"
16937,III,"One terrible cry that plucked my heart-strings out,"
16938,III,"_Mary!_ And on the closed and silent tomb,"
16939,III,"Where there were two, one shuddering shadow lay,"
16940,III,"And then--I, too,--reeled, swooned and knew no more."
16941,III,
16942,III,"Sirs, when I woke, there was a broad bright shaft"
16943,III,"Of moonlight, slanting through an Eastern pane"
16944,III,Full on her tomb and that black Catafalque.
16945,III,And on the tomb there lay--my bunch of keys!
16946,III,"I struggled to my feet,"
16947,III,"Ashamed of my wild fancies, like a man"
16948,III,"Awakening from a drunken dream. And yet,"
16949,III,"When I picked up the keys, although that storm"
16950,III,"Of terror had all blown by and left me calm,"
16951,III,I lifted up mine eyes to see the scroll
16952,III,"Round the rich crest of that dark canopy,"
16953,III,"IN MY DEFENCE, GOD ME DEFEND. The moon"
16954,III,"Struck full upon it; and, as I turned and went,"
16955,III,"God help me, sirs, though I were loyal enough"
16956,III,"To good Queen Bess, I could not help but say,"
16957,III,_Amen!_
16958,III,"And yet, methought it was not I that spake,"
16959,III,"But some deep soul that used me for a mask,"
16960,III,A soul that rose up in this hollow shell
16961,III,Like dark sea-tides flooding an empty cave.
16962,III,"I could not help but say with my poor lips,"
16963,III,_Amen! Amen!_
16964,III,"Sirs, 'tis a terrible thing"
16965,III,To move in great events. Since that strange night
16966,III,I have not been as other men. The tides
16967,III,"Would rise in this dark cave""--he tapped his skull--"
16968,III,"""Deep tides, I know not whence; and when they rose"
16969,III,My friends looked strangely upon me and stood aloof.
16970,III,"And once, my uncle said to me--indeed,"
16971,III,"It troubled me strangely,--'Timothy,' he said,"
16972,III,'Thou art translated! I could well believe
16973,III,"Thou art two men, whereof the one's a fool,"
16974,III,"The other a prophet. Or else, beneath thy skin"
16975,III,There lurks a changeling! What hath come to thee?'
16976,III,"And then, sirs, then--well I remember it!"
16977,III,"'Twas on a summer eve, and we walked home"
16978,III,Between high ghostly hedges white with may--
16979,III,"And uncle Robin, in his holy-day suit"
16980,III,"Of Reading Tawny, felt his old heart swell"
16981,III,With pride in his great memories. He began
16982,III,"Chanting the pedlar's tune, keeping the time"
16983,III,"Thus, jingle, jingle, slowly, with his keys:--"
16984,III,
16985,III,
16986,I,I
16987,I,
16988,I,"Douglas, in the moonless night"
16989,I,--_Muffled oars on blue Loch Leven!_--
16990,I,"Took her hand, a flake of white"
16991,I,--_Beauty slides the bolts of heaven._--
16992,I,"Little white hand, like a flake of snow,"
16993,I,"When they saw it, his Highland crew"
16994,I,"Swung together and murmured low,"
16995,I,"""Douglas, wilt _thou_ die then, too?"""
16996,I,"And the pine trees whispered, weeping,"
16997,I,"""_Douglas, Douglas, tender and true!_"
16998,I,"Little white hand like a tender moonbeam, soon shall you set the"
16999,I,"broadswords leaping,"
17000,I,"It is the Queen, the Queen!"" they whispered, watching her soar to"
17001,I,the saddle anew.
17002,I,"""There will be trumpets blown in the mountains, a mist of blood on the"
17003,I,"heather, and weeping,"
17004,I,"Weeping, weeping, and _thou_, too, dead for her, Douglas, Douglas,"
17005,I,"tender and true."""
17006,I,
17007,I,
17008,II,II
17009,II,
17010,II,Carry the queenly lass along!
17011,II,"--_Cold she lies, cold and dead,_--"
17012,II,"She whose laughter was a song,"
17013,II,--_Lapped around with sheets of lead!_--
17014,II,"She whose blood was wine of the South,"
17015,II,--_Light her down to a couch of clay!_--
17016,II,"And a royal rose her mouth,"
17017,II,And her body made of may!
17018,II,"--Lift your torches, weeping, weeping,"
17019,II,Light her down to a couch of clay.
17020,II,"They should have left her in her vineyards, left her heart to her"
17021,II,"land's own keeping,"
17022,II,"Left her white breast room to breathe, and left her light foot"
17023,II,free to dance!
17024,II,
17025,II,"Hush! Between the solemn pinewoods, carry the lovely lady sleeping,"
17026,II,"Out of the cold grey Northern mists, with banner and scutcheon,"
17027,II,"plume, and lance,"
17028,II,"Carry her southward, palled in purple, weeping, weeping, weeping, weeping,--"
17029,II,"_O, ma patrie,"
17030,II,"La plus chérie,"
17031,II,"Adieu, plaisant pays de France!_"
17032,II,
17033,II,
17034,II,"Well, sirs, that dark tide rose within my brain!"
17035,II,"I snatched his keys and flung them over the hedge,"
17036,II,Then flung myself down on a bank of ferns
17037,II,And wept and wept and wept.
17038,II,It puzzled him.
17039,II,"Perchance he feared my mind was going and yet,"
17040,II,"O, sirs, if you consider it rightly now,"
17041,II,"With all those ages knocking at his doors,"
17042,II,"With all that custom clamouring for his care,"
17043,II,Is it so strange a grave-digger should weep?
17044,II,Well--he was kind enough and heaped my plate
17045,II,That night at supper.
17046,II,But I could never dig my graves at ease
17047,II,In Peterborough Churchyard. So I came
17048,II,To London--to St. Mary Magdalen's.
17049,II,"And thus, I chanced to drink my ale one night"
17050,II,"Here in the Mermaid Inn. 'Twas All Souls' Eve,"
17051,II,"And, on that bench, where master Ford now sits"
17052,II,Was master Shakespeare--
17053,II,"Well, the lights burned low,"
17054,II,And just like master Ford to-night he leaned
17055,II,"Suddenly forward. 'Timothy,' he said,"
17056,II,'That's a most marvellous ruby!'
17057,II,My blood froze!
17058,II,I stretched my hand out bare as it was born;
17059,II,"And he said nothing, only looked at me."
17060,II,"Then, seeing my pipe was empty, he bade me fill"
17061,II,And lit it for me.
17062,II,"Peach, the astrologer,"
17063,II,Was living then; and that same night I went
17064,II,And told him all my trouble about this ring.
17065,II,"He took my hand in his, and held it--thus--"
17066,II,Then looked into my face and said this rhyme:--
17067,II,
17068,II,"_The ruby ring, that only three"
17069,II,"While Time and Tide go by, shall see,"
17070,II,Weds your hand to history._
17071,II,
17072,II,_Honour and pride the first shall lend;
17073,II,The second shall give you gold to spend;
17074,II,The third--shall warn you of your end._
17075,II,
17076,II,"Peach was a rogue, some say, and yet he spake"
17077,II,"Most truly about the first,"" the sexton mused,"
17078,II,"""For master Shakespeare, though they say in youth"
17079,II,"Outside the theatres, he would hold your horse"
17080,II,"For pence, prospered at last, bought a fine house"
17081,II,"In Stratford, lived there like a squire, they say."
17082,II,"And here, here he would sit, for all the world"
17083,II,"As he were but a poet! God bless us all,"
17084,II,And then--to think!--he rose to be a squire!
17085,II,"A deep one, masters! Well, he lit my pipe!"""
17086,II,"""Why did they bury such a queen by night?"""
17087,II,"Said Ford. ""Kings might have wept for her. Did Death"
17088,II,Play epicure and glutton that so few
17089,II,"Were bidden to such a feast. Once on a time,"
17090,II,"I could have wept, myself, to hear a tale"
17091,II,Of beauty buried in the dark. And hers
17092,II,"Was loveliness, far, far beyond the common!"
17093,II,Such beauty should be marble to the touch
17094,II,"Of time, and clad in purple to amaze"
17095,II,"The moth. But she was kind and soft and fair,"
17096,II,"A woman, and so she died. But, why the dark?"""
17097,II,
17098,II,"""Sir, they gave out the coffin was too heavy"
17099,II,"For gentlemen to bear!""--""For kings to bear?"""
17100,II,"Ford flashed at him. The sexton shook his head,--"
17101,II,"""Nay! Gentlemen to bear! But--the true cause--"
17102,II,"Ah, sir, 'tis unbelievable, even to me,"
17103,II,"A sexton, for a queen so fair of face!"
17104,II,"And all her beds, even as the pedlar said,"
17105,II,"Breathing Arabia, sirs, her walls all hung"
17106,II,With woven purple wonders and great tales
17107,II,"Of amorous gods, and mighty mirrors, too,"
17108,II,"Imaging her own softness, night and dawn,"
17109,II,When through her sumptuous hair she drew the combs;
17110,II,And like one great white rose-leaf half her breast
17111,II,"Shone through it, firm as ivory."""
17112,II,"""Ay,"" said Lodge,"
17113,II,"Murmuring his own rich music under breath,"
17114,II,"""_About her neck did all the graces throng,"
17115,II,"And lay such baits as did entangle death._"""
17116,II,"""Well, sir, the weather being hot, they feared"
17117,II,"She would not hold the burying!""..."
17118,II,"""In some sort,"""
17119,II,"Ford answered slowly, ""if your tale be true,"
17120,II,She did not hold it. Many a knightly crest
17121,II,"Will bend yet o'er the ghost of that small hand."""
17122,II,
17123,II,"There was a hush, broken by Ben at last,"
17124,II,"Who turned to Ford--""How now, my golden lad?"
17125,II,"The astrologer's dead hand is on thy purse!"""
17126,II,
17127,II,"Ford laughed, grimly, and flung an angel down."
17128,II,"""Well, cause or consequence, rhyme or no rhyme,"
17129,II,"There is thy gold. I will not break the spell,"
17130,II,"Or thou mayst live to bury us one and all!"""
17131,II,"""And, if I live so long,"" the old man replied,"
17132,II,"Lighting his lanthorn, ""you may trust me, sirs,"
17133,II,"Mine Inn is quiet, and I can find you beds"
17134,II,Where Queens might sleep all night and never move.
17135,II,"Good-night, sirs, and God bless you, one and all."""
17136,II,He shouldered pick and spade. I opened the door.
17137,II,"The snow blew in, and, as he shuffled out,"
17138,II,"There, in the strait dark passage, I could swear"
17139,II,"I saw a spark of red upon his hand,"
17140,II,Like a great smouldering ruby.
17141,II,I gasped. He stopped.
17142,II,He peered at me.
17143,II,"""Twice in a night,"" he said."
17144,II,"""Nothing,"" I answered, ""only the lanthorn-light."""
17145,II,"He shook his head. ""I'll tell you something more!"
17146,II,"There's nothing, nothing now in life or death"
17147,II,"That frightens me. Ah, things used to frighten me."
17148,II,But never now. I thought I had ten years;
17149,II,"But if the warning comes and says '_Thou fool,"
17150,II,"This night!_' Why, then, I'm ready."""
17151,II,"I watched him go,"
17152,II,"With glimmering lanthorn up the narrow street,"
17153,II,"Like one that walked upon the clouds, through snow"
17154,II,That seemed to mix the City with the skies.
17155,II,
17156,II,On Christmas Eve we heard that he was dead.

17161,FLOS MERCATORUM,FLOS MERCATORUM
17162,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17163,FLOS MERCATORUM,FLOS MERCATORUM! On that night of nights
17164,FLOS MERCATORUM,We drew from out our Mermaid cellarage
17165,FLOS MERCATORUM,All the old glory of London in one cask
17166,FLOS MERCATORUM,Of magic vintage. Never a city on earth--
17167,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Rome, Paris, Florence, Bagdad--held for Ben"
17168,FLOS MERCATORUM,"The colours of old London; and, that night,"
17169,FLOS MERCATORUM,"We staved them like a wine, and drank, drank deep!"
17170,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17171,FLOS MERCATORUM,"'Twas Master Heywood, whom the Mermaid Inn"
17172,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Had dubbed our London laureate, hauled the cask"
17173,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Out of its ancient harbourage. ""Ben,"" he cried,"
17174,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Bustling into the room with Dekker and Brome,"
17175,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""The prentices are up!"" Ben raised his head"
17176,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Out of the chimney-corner where he drowsed,"
17177,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And listened, reaching slowly for his pipe."
17178,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17179,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""_Clerk of the Bow Bell_,"" all along the Cheape"
17180,FLOS MERCATORUM,There came a shout that swelled into a roar.
17181,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""What! Will they storm the Mermaid?"" Heywood laughed,"
17182,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""They are turning into Bread Street!"""
17183,FLOS MERCATORUM,Down they came!
17184,FLOS MERCATORUM,We heard them hooting round the poor old Clerk--
17185,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Clubs! Clubs! The rogue would have us work all night!"
17186,FLOS MERCATORUM,"He rang ten minutes late! Fifteen, by Paul's!"""
17187,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And over the hubbub rose, like a thin bell,"
17188,FLOS MERCATORUM,"The Clerk's entreaty--""Now, good boys, good boys,"
17189,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Children of Cheape, be still, I do beseech you!"
17190,FLOS MERCATORUM,"I took some forty winks, but then...."" A roar"
17191,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Of wrathful laughter drowned him--""Forty winks!"
17192,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Remember Black May-day! We'll make you wink!"""
17193,FLOS MERCATORUM,"There was a scuffle, and into the tavern rushed"
17194,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Gregory Clopton, Clerk of the Bow Bell,--"
17195,FLOS MERCATORUM,"A tall thin man, with yellow hair a-stream,"
17196,FLOS MERCATORUM,And blazing eyes.
17197,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Hide me,"" he clamoured, ""quick!"
17198,FLOS MERCATORUM,"These picaroons will murder me!"""
17199,FLOS MERCATORUM,I closed
17200,FLOS MERCATORUM,The thick oak doors against the coloured storm
17201,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Of prentices in red and green and ray,"
17202,FLOS MERCATORUM,Saffron and Reading tawny. Twenty clubs
17203,FLOS MERCATORUM,Drubbed on the panels as I barred them out;
17204,FLOS MERCATORUM,And even our walls and shutters could not drown
17205,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Their song that, like a mocking peal of bells,"
17206,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Under our windows, made all Bread Street ring:--"
17207,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17208,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""_Clerk of the Bow Bell,"
17209,FLOS MERCATORUM,"With the yellow locks,"

17211,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Thy head shall have knocks!_"""
17212,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17213,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Then Heywood, seeing the Clerk was all a-quake,"
17214,FLOS MERCATORUM,Went to an upper casement that o'er-looked
17215,FLOS MERCATORUM,"The whole of Bread Street. Heywood knew their ways,"
17216,FLOS MERCATORUM,And parleyed with them till their anger turned
17217,FLOS MERCATORUM,"To shouts of merriment. Then, like one deep bell"
17218,FLOS MERCATORUM,"His voice rang out, in answer to their peal:--"
17219,FLOS MERCATORUM,

17224,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17225,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Loudly they cheered him. Courteously he bowed,"
17226,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Then firmly shut the window; and, ere I filled"
17227,FLOS MERCATORUM,"His cup with sack again, the crowd had gone."
17228,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17229,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""My clochard, sirs, is warm,"" quavered the Clerk."
17230,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""I do confess I took some forty winks!"
17231,FLOS MERCATORUM,"They are good lads, our prentices of Cheape,"
17232,FLOS MERCATORUM,"But hasty!"""
17233,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Wine!"" said Ben. He filled a cup"
17234,FLOS MERCATORUM,And thrust it into Gregory's trembling hands.
17235,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Yours is a task,"" said Dekker, ""a great task!"
17236,FLOS MERCATORUM,"You sit among the gods, a lord of time,"
17237,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Measuring out the pulse of London's heart."""
17238,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Yea, sir, above the hours and days and years,"
17239,FLOS MERCATORUM,I sometimes think. 'Tis a great Bell--the Bow!
17240,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And hath been, since the days of Whittington."""
17241,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""The good old days,"" growled Ben. ""Both good and bad"
17242,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Were measured by my Bell,"" the Clerk replied."
17243,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And, while he spoke, warmed by the wine, his voice"
17244,FLOS MERCATORUM,Mellowed and floated up and down the scale
17245,FLOS MERCATORUM,As if the music of the London bells
17246,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Lingered upon his tongue. ""I know them all,"
17247,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And love them, all the voices of the bells."
17248,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17249,FLOS MERCATORUM,FLOS MERCATORUM! That's the Bell of Bow
17250,FLOS MERCATORUM,Remembering Richard Whittington. You should hear
17251,FLOS MERCATORUM,The bells of London when they tell his tale.
17252,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Once, after hearing them, I wrote it down."
17253,FLOS MERCATORUM,"I know the tale by heart now, every turn."""
17254,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Then ring it out,"" said Heywood."
17255,FLOS MERCATORUM,Gregory smiled
17256,FLOS MERCATORUM,And cleared his throat.
17257,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""You must imagine, sirs,"
17258,FLOS MERCATORUM,"The Clerk, sitting on high, among the clouds,"
17259,FLOS MERCATORUM,With London spread beneath him like a map.
17260,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Under his tower, a flock of prentices"
17261,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Calling like bells, of little size or weight,"
17262,FLOS MERCATORUM,"But bells no less, ask that the Bell of Bow"
17263,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Shall tell the tale of Richard Whittington,"
17264,FLOS MERCATORUM,"As thus."""
17265,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Then Gregory Clopton, mellowing all"
17266,FLOS MERCATORUM,"The chiming vowels, and dwelling on every tone"
17267,FLOS MERCATORUM,In rhythm or rhyme that helped to swell the peal
17268,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Or keep the ringing measure, beat for beat,"
17269,FLOS MERCATORUM,Chanted this legend of the London bells:--
17270,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17271,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Clerk of the Bow Bell, four and twenty prentices,"
17272,FLOS MERCATORUM,"All upon a Hallowe'en, we prithee, for our joy,"
17273,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Ring a little turn again for sweet Dick Whittington,"
17274,FLOS MERCATORUM,"_Flos Mercatorum_, and a barefoot boy!--"
17275,FLOS MERCATORUM,

17283,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Ay, and we are all, too, Marchaunt Adventurers,"
17284,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Prentices of London, and lords of Engeland."

17297,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""There was he an orphan, O, a little lad alone!"""
17298,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Then we all sang,"" echoed happy St. Saviour's,"
17299,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Called him, and lured him, and made him our own."
17300,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17301,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Told him a tale as he lay upon the hillside,"

17303,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Told him a tale,"" clanged the bell of Cold Abbey;"
17304,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Told him the truth,"" boomed the big Bell of Bow!"
17305,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17306,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Sang of a City that was like a blazoned missal-book,"
17307,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Black with oaken gables, carven and inscrolled;"
17308,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Every street a coloured page, and every sign a hieroglyph,"
17309,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Dusky with enchantments, a City paved with gold;"
17310,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17311,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Younger son, younger son, up with stick and bundle!""--"
17312,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Even so we rung for him--""But--kneel before you go;"
17313,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Watch by your shield, lad, in little Pauntley Chancel,"
17314,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Look upon the painted panes that hold your Arms a-glow,--"
17315,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17316,FLOS MERCATORUM,Coat of Gules and Azure; but the proud will not remember it!
17317,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And the Crest a Lion's Head, until the new be won!"
17318,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Far away, remember it! And O, remember this, too,--"
17319,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Every barefoot boy on earth is but a younger son."""
17320,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17321,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Proudly he answered us, beneath the painted window,--"
17322,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Though I be a younger son, the glory falls to me:"
17323,FLOS MERCATORUM,"While my brother bideth by a little land in Gloucestershire,"

17325,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17326,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Yet will I remember, yet will I remember,"
17327,FLOS MERCATORUM,"By the chivalry of God, until my day be done,"
17328,FLOS MERCATORUM,"When I meet a gentle heart, lonely and unshielded,"
17329,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Every barefoot boy on earth is but a younger son!"""
17330,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17331,FLOS MERCATORUM,Then he looked to Northward for the tall ships of Bristol;
17332,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Far away, and cold as death, he saw the Severn shine:"
17333,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Then he looked to Eastward, and he saw a string of colours"
17334,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Trickling through the grey hills, like elfin drops of wine;"
17335,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17336,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Down along the Mendip dale, the chapmen and their horses,"
17337,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Far away, and carrying each its little coloured load,"
17338,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Winding like a fairy-tale, with pack and corded bundle,"
17339,FLOS MERCATORUM,Trickled like a crimson thread along the silver road.
17340,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17341,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Quick he ran to meet them, stick and bundle on his shoulder!"
17342,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Over by Cold Ashton, he met them trampling down,--"
17343,FLOS MERCATORUM,"White shaggy horses with their packs of purple spicery,"
17344,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Crimson kegs of malmsey, and the silks of London town."
17345,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17346,FLOS MERCATORUM,"When the chapmen asked of him the bridle-path to Dorset,"
17347,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Blithely he showed them, and he led them on their way,"
17348,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Led them through the fern with their bales of breathing Araby,"
17349,FLOS MERCATORUM,Led them to a bridle-path that saved them half a day.
17350,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17351,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Merrily shook the silver bells that hung the broidered bridle-rein,"
17352,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Chiming to his hand, as he led them through the fern,"
17353,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Down to deep Dorset, and the wooded Isle of Purbeck,"
17354,FLOS MERCATORUM,Then--by little Kimmeridge--they led him turn for turn.
17355,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17356,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Down by little Kimmeridge, and up by Hampshire forest-roads,"
17357,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Round by Sussex violets, and apple-bloom of Kent,"
17358,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Singing songs of London, telling tales of London,"
17359,FLOS MERCATORUM,"All the way to London, with packs of wool they went."
17360,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17361,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""London was London, then! A clean, clear moat"
17362,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Girdled her walls that measured, round about,"

17364,FLOS MERCATORUM,Said Dekker.
17365,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Call it a silver moat,"" growled Ben,"
17366,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""That's the new poetry! Call it crystal, lad!"
17367,FLOS MERCATORUM,"But, till you kiss the Beast, you'll never find"
17368,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Your Fairy Prince. Why, all those crowded streets,"
17369,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Flung all their filth, their refuse, rags and bones,"
17370,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Dead cats and dogs, into your clean clear moat,"
17371,FLOS MERCATORUM,And made it sluggish as old Acheron.
17372,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Fevers and plagues, death in a thousand shapes"
17373,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Crawled out of it. London was dirty, lad;"
17374,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And till you kiss that fact, you'll never see"
17375,FLOS MERCATORUM,"The glory of this old Jerusalem!"""
17376,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Ay, 'tis the fogs that make the sunset red,"""
17377,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Answered Tom Heywood. ""London is earthy, coarse,"
17378,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Grimy and grand. You must make dirt the ground,"
17379,FLOS MERCATORUM,Or lose the colours of friend Clopton's tale.
17380,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Ring on!"" And, nothing loth, the Clerk resumed:--"
17381,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17382,FLOS MERCATORUM,Bravely swelled his heart to see the moat of London glittering
17383,FLOS MERCATORUM,Round her mighty wall--they told him--two miles long!
17384,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Then--he gasped as, echoing in by grim black Aldgate,"
17385,FLOS MERCATORUM,Suddenly their shaggy nags were nodding through a throng:
17386,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17387,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Prentices in red and ray, marchaunts in their saffron,"
17388,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Aldermen in violets, and minstrels in white,"
17389,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Clerks in homely hoods of budge, and wives with crimson wimples,"
17390,FLOS MERCATORUM,Thronging as to welcome him that happy summer night.
17391,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17392,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Back,"" they cried, and ""Clear the way,"" and caught the ringing"
17393,FLOS MERCATORUM,bridle-reins:
17394,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Wait! the Watch is going by, this vigil of St. John!"""
17395,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Merrily laughed the chapmen then, reining their great white horses back,"
17396,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""When the pageant passes, lad, we'll up and follow on!"""
17397,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17398,FLOS MERCATORUM,"There, as thick the crowd surged, beneath the blossomed ale-poles,"
17399,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Lifting up to Whittington a fair face afraid,"
17400,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Swept against his horse by a billow of madcap prentices,"
17401,FLOS MERCATORUM,Hard against the stirrup breathed a green-gowned maid.
17402,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17403,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Swift he drew her up and up, and throned her there before him,"
17404,FLOS MERCATORUM,"High above the throng with her laughing April eyes,"
17405,FLOS MERCATORUM,Like a Queen of Faërie on the great pack-saddle.
17406,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Hey!"" laughed the chapmen, ""the prentice wins the prize!"""
17407,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17408,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Whittington! Whittington! the world is all before you!"""
17409,FLOS MERCATORUM,Blithely rang the bells and the steeples rocked and reeled!
17410,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Then--he saw her eyes grow wide, and, all along by Leaden Hall,"
17411,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Drums rolled, earth shook, and shattering trumpets pealed."
17412,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17413,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Like a marching sunset, there, from Leaden Hall to Aldgate,"
17414,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Flared the crimson cressets--O, her brows were haloed then!--"
17415,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Then the stirring steeds went by with all their mounted trumpeters,"
17416,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Then, in ringing harness, a thousand marching men."
17417,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17418,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Marching--marching--his heart and all the halberdiers,"
17419,FLOS MERCATORUM,And his pulses throbbing with the throbbing of the drums;
17420,FLOS MERCATORUM,Marching--marching--his blood and all the burganets!
17421,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Look,"" she cried, ""O, look,"" she cried, ""and now the morrice comes!"""
17422,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17423,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Dancing--dancing--her eyes and all the Lincoln Green,"
17424,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Robin Hood and Friar Tuck, dancing through the town!"
17425,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Where is Marian?"" Laughingly she turned to Richard Whittington."
17426,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Here,"" he said, and pointed to her own green gown."
17427,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17428,FLOS MERCATORUM,Dancing--dancing--her heart and all the morrice-bells!
17429,FLOS MERCATORUM,Then there burst a mighty shout from thrice a thousand throats!
17430,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Then, with all their bows bent, and sheaves of peacock arrows,"
17431,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Marched the tall archers in their white silk coats,"
17432,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17433,FLOS MERCATORUM,"White silk coats, with the crest of London City"
17434,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Crimson on the shoulder, a sign for all to read,--"
17435,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Marching--marching--and then the sworded henchmen,"
17436,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Then, William Walworth, on his great stirring steed."
17437,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17438,FLOS MERCATORUM,"_Flos Mercatorum_, ay, the fish-monger, Walworth,--"
17439,FLOS MERCATORUM,"He whose nets of silk drew the silver from the tide,"
17440,FLOS MERCATORUM,"He who saved the king when the king was but a prentice,--"
17441,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Lord Mayor of London, with his sword at his side!"
17442,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17443,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Burned with magic changes, his blood and all the pageantry;"
17444,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Burned with deep sea-changes, the wonder in her eyes;"
17445,FLOS MERCATORUM,"_Flos Mercatorum!_ 'Twas the rose-mary of Paphos,"
17446,FLOS MERCATORUM,Reddening all the City for the prentice and his prize!
17447,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17448,FLOS MERCATORUM,"All the book of London, the pages of adventure,"
17449,FLOS MERCATORUM,Passed before the prentice on that vigil of St. John:
17450,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Then the chapmen shook their reins,--""We'll ride behind the revelry,"
17451,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Round again to Cornhill! Up, and follow on!"""
17452,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17453,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Riding on his pack-horse, above the shouting multitude,"
17454,FLOS MERCATORUM,"There she turned and smiled at him, and thanked him for his grace:"
17455,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Let me down by _Red Rose Lane_,"" and, like a wave of twilight"
17456,FLOS MERCATORUM,"While she spoke, her shadowy hair--touched his tingling face."
17457,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17458,FLOS MERCATORUM,"When they came to _Red Rose Lane_, beneath the blossomed ale-poles,"
17459,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Light along his arm she lay, a moment, leaping down:"
17460,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Then she waved ""farewell"" to him, and down the Lane he watched her"
17461,FLOS MERCATORUM,Flitting through the darkness in her gay green gown.
17462,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17463,FLOS MERCATORUM,"All along the Cheape, as he rode among the chapmen,"
17464,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Round by _Black Friars_, to the _Two-Necked Swan_"
17465,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Coloured like the sunset, prentices and maidens"
17466,FLOS MERCATORUM,Danced for red roses on the vigil of St. John.
17467,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17468,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Over them were jewelled lamps in great black galleries,"
17469,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Garlanded with beauty, and burning all the night;"
17470,FLOS MERCATORUM,"All the doors were shadowy with orpin and St. John's wort,"
17471,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Long fennel, green birch, and lilies of delight."
17472,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17473,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""He should have slept here at the Mermaid Inn,"""
17474,FLOS MERCATORUM,Said Heywood as the chanter paused for breath.
17475,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""What? Has our Mermaid sung so long?"" cried Ben."
17476,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Her beams are black enough. There was an Inn,"""
17477,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Said Tom, ""that bore the name; and through its heart"
17478,FLOS MERCATORUM,There flowed the right old purple. I like to think
17479,FLOS MERCATORUM,"It was the same, where Lydgate took his ease"
17480,FLOS MERCATORUM,"After his hood was stolen; and Gower, perchance;"
17481,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And, though he loved the _Tabard_ for a-while,"
17482,FLOS MERCATORUM,"I like to think the Father of us all,"
17483,FLOS MERCATORUM,The old Adam of English minstrelsy caroused
17484,FLOS MERCATORUM,Here in the Mermaid Tavern. I like to think
17485,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Jolly Dan Chaucer, with his kind shrewd face"
17486,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Fresh as an apple above his fur-fringed gown,"
17487,FLOS MERCATORUM,"One plump hand sporting with his golden chain,"
17488,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Looked out from that old casement over the sign,"
17489,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And saw the pageant, and the shaggy nags,"
17490,FLOS MERCATORUM,"With Whittington, and his green-gowned maid, go by."
17491,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""O, very like,"" said Clopton, ""for the bells"
17492,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Left not a head indoors that night."" He drank"
17493,FLOS MERCATORUM,A draught of malmsey--and thus renewed his tale:--
17494,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17495,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""_Flos Mercatorum_,"" mourned the bell of All Hallowes,"
17496,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""There was he an orphan, O, a little lad alone,"
17497,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Rubbing down the great white horses for a supper!"""
17498,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""True,"" boomed the Bow Bell, ""his hands were his own!"""
17499,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17500,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Where did he sleep? On a plump white wool-pack,"
17501,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Open to the moon on that vigil of St. John,"
17502,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Sheltered from the dew, where the black-timbered gallery"
17503,FLOS MERCATORUM,Frowned above the yard of the _Two-Necked Swan_.
17504,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17505,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Early in the morning, clanged the bell of St. Martin's,"
17506,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Early in the morning, with a groat in his hand,"
17507,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Mournfully he parted with the jolly-hearted chapmen,"
17508,FLOS MERCATORUM,Shouldered his bundle and walked into the _Strand_;
17509,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17510,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Walked into the _Strand_, and back again to _West Cheape_,"
17511,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Staring at the wizardry of every painted sign,"
17512,FLOS MERCATORUM,Dazed with the steeples and the rich heraldic cornices
17513,FLOS MERCATORUM,Drinking in the colours of the Cheape like wine.
17514,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17515,FLOS MERCATORUM,"All about the booths now, the parti-coloured prentices"
17516,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Fluted like a flock of birds along a summer lane,"
17517,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Green linnets, red caps, and gay gold finches,--"
17518,FLOS MERCATORUM,"_What d'ye lack, and what d'ye lack, and what d'ye lack again?_"
17519,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17520,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Buy my dainty doublets, cut on double taffetas,"
17521,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Buy my Paris thread,"" they cried, and caught him by the hand,"
17522,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Laces for your Heart's-Delight, and lawns to make her love you,"
17523,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Cambric for her wimple, O, the finest in the land."""
17524,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17525,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Ah, but he was hungry, foot-sore, weary,"
17526,FLOS MERCATORUM,Knocking at the doors of the armourers that day!
17527,FLOS MERCATORUM,_What d'ye lack?_ they asked of him; but no man lacked a prentice:
17528,FLOS MERCATORUM,"When he told them what he lacked, they frowned and turned away."
17529,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17530,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Hard was his bed that night, beneath a cruel archway,"
17531,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Down among the hulks, with his heart growing cold!"
17532,FLOS MERCATORUM,"London is a rare town, but O, the streets of London,"
17533,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Red though their flints be, they are not red with gold."
17534,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17535,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Pale in the dawn, ere he marched on his adventure,"
17536,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Starving for a crust, did he kneel a-while again,"
17537,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Then, upon the fourth night, he cried, O, like a wounded bird"
17538,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Let me die, if die I must, in _Red Rose Lane_."""
17539,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17540,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Like a little wounded bird he trailed through the darkness,"
17541,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Laid him on a door-step, and then--O, like a breath"
17542,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Pitifully blowing out his life's little rushlight,"
17543,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Came a gush of blackness, a swoon deep as death."
17544,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17545,FLOS MERCATORUM,Then he heard a rough voice! Then he saw a lanthorn!
17546,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Then he saw a bearded face, and blindly wondered whose:"
17547,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Then--a marchaunt's portly legs, with great Rose-Windows,"
17548,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Bigger than St. Paul's, he thought, embroidered on his shoes."
17549,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17550,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Alice!"" roared the voice, and then, O like a lilied angel,"
17551,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Leaning from the lighted door a fair face afraid,"
17552,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Leaning over _Red Rose Lane_, O, leaning out of Paradise,"
17553,FLOS MERCATORUM,Drooped the sudden glory of his green-gowned maid!
17554,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17555,FLOS MERCATORUM,*   *   *   *
17556,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17557,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""O, mellow be thy malmsey,"" grunted Ben,"
17558,FLOS MERCATORUM,Filling the Clerk another cup.
17559,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""The peal,"""
17560,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Quoth Clopton, ""is not ended; but the pause"
17561,FLOS MERCATORUM,"In ringing, chimes to a deep inward ear"
17562,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And tells its own deep tale. Silence and sound,"
17563,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Darkness and light, mourning and mirth,--no tale,"
17564,FLOS MERCATORUM,"No painting, and no music, nay, no world,"
17565,FLOS MERCATORUM,If God should cut their fruitful marriage-knot.
17566,FLOS MERCATORUM,A shallow sort to-day would fain deny
17567,FLOS MERCATORUM,"A hell, sirs, to this boundless universe."
17568,FLOS MERCATORUM,"To such I say 'no hell, no Paradise!'"
17569,FLOS MERCATORUM,Others would fain deny the topless towers
17570,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Of heaven, and make this earth a hell indeed."
17571,FLOS MERCATORUM,"To such I say, 'the unplumbed gulfs of grief"
17572,FLOS MERCATORUM,Are only theirs for whom the blissful chimes
17573,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Ring from those unseen heights.' This earth, mid-way,"
17574,FLOS MERCATORUM,Hangs like a belfry where the ringers grasp
17575,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Their ropes in darkness, each in his own place,"
17576,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Each knowing, by the tune in his own heart,"
17577,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Never by sight, when he must toss through heaven"
17578,FLOS MERCATORUM,The tone of his own bell. Those bounded souls
17579,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Have never heard our chimes! Why, sirs, myself"
17580,FLOS MERCATORUM,Simply by running up and down the scale
17581,FLOS MERCATORUM,Descend to hell or soar to heaven. My bells
17582,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Height above height, deep below deep, respond!"
17583,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Their scale is infinite. Dare I, for one breath,"
17584,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Dream that one note hath crowned and ended all,"
17585,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Sudden I hear, far, far above those clouds,"
17586,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Like laughing angels, peal on golden peal,"
17587,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Innumerable as drops of April rain,"
17588,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Yet every note distinct, round as a pearl,"
17589,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And perfect in its place, a chime of law,"
17590,FLOS MERCATORUM,Whose pure and boundless mere arithmetic
17591,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Climbs with my soul to God."""
17592,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Ben looked at him,"
17593,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Gently. ""Resume, old moralist,"" he said."
17594,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""On to thy marriage-bells!"""
17595,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""The fairy-tales"
17596,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Are wiser than they know, sirs. All our woes"
17597,FLOS MERCATORUM,Lead on to those celestial marriage-bells.
17598,FLOS MERCATORUM,The world's a-wooing; and the pure City of God
17599,FLOS MERCATORUM,Peals for the wedding of our joy and pain!
17600,FLOS MERCATORUM,This was well seen of Richard Whittington;
17601,FLOS MERCATORUM,For only he that finds the London streets
17602,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Paved with red flints, at last shall find them paved"
17603,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Like to the Perfect City, with pure gold."
17604,FLOS MERCATORUM,Ye know the world! what was a London waif
17605,FLOS MERCATORUM,To Hugh Fitzwarren's daughter? He was fed
17606,FLOS MERCATORUM,And harboured; and the cook declared she lacked
17607,FLOS MERCATORUM,"A scullion. So, in Hugh Fitzwarren's house,"
17608,FLOS MERCATORUM,"He turned the jack, and scoured the dripping-pan."
17609,FLOS MERCATORUM,How could he hope for more?
17610,FLOS MERCATORUM,This marchaunt's house
17611,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Was builded like a great high-gabled inn,"
17612,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Square, with a galleried courtyard, such as now"
17613,FLOS MERCATORUM,The players use. Its rooms were rich and dim
17614,FLOS MERCATORUM,With deep-set coloured panes and massy beams.
17615,FLOS MERCATORUM,Its ancient eaves jutted o'er _Red Rose Lane_
17616,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Darkly, like eyebrows of a mage asleep."
17617,FLOS MERCATORUM,Its oaken stair coiled upward through a dusk
17618,FLOS MERCATORUM,Heavy with fume of scented woods that burned
17619,FLOS MERCATORUM,"To keep the Plague away,--a gloom to embalm"
17620,FLOS MERCATORUM,"A Pharaoh, but to dull the cheek and eye"
17621,FLOS MERCATORUM,Of country lads like Whittington.
17622,FLOS MERCATORUM,He pined
17623,FLOS MERCATORUM,For wind and sunlight. Yet he plied his task
17624,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Patient as in old tales of Elfin-land,"
17625,FLOS MERCATORUM,The young knight would unhelm his golden locks
17626,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And play the scullion, so that he might watch"
17627,FLOS MERCATORUM,"His lady's eyes unknown, and oftener hear"
17628,FLOS MERCATORUM,Her brook-like laughter rippling overhead;
17629,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Her green gown, like the breath of Eden boughs,"
17630,FLOS MERCATORUM,Rustling nigh him. And all day long he found
17631,FLOS MERCATORUM,Sunshine enough in this. But when at night
17632,FLOS MERCATORUM,"He crept into the low dark vaulted den,"
17633,FLOS MERCATORUM,"The cobwebbed cellar, where the cook had strewn"
17634,FLOS MERCATORUM,The scullion's bed of straw (and none too thick
17635,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Lest he should sleep too long), he choked for breath;"
17636,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And, like an old man hoarding up his life,"
17637,FLOS MERCATORUM,Fostered his glimmering rushlight as he sate
17638,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Bolt upright, while a horrible scurry heaved"
17639,FLOS MERCATORUM,"His rustling bed, and bright black-beaded eyes"
17640,FLOS MERCATORUM,Peered at him from the crannies of the wall.
17641,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Then darkness whelmed him, and perchance he slept,--"
17642,FLOS MERCATORUM,Only to fight with nightmares and to fly
17643,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Down endless tunnels in a ghastly dream,"
17644,FLOS MERCATORUM,Hunted by horrible human souls that took
17645,FLOS MERCATORUM,"The shape of monstrous rats, great chattering snouts,"
17646,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Vile shapes of shadowy cunning and grey greed,"
17647,FLOS MERCATORUM,"That gnaw through beams, and undermine tall towns,"
17648,FLOS MERCATORUM,And carry the seeds of plague and ruin and death
17649,FLOS MERCATORUM,Under the careless homes of sleeping men.
17650,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Thus, in the darkness, did he wage a war"
17651,FLOS MERCATORUM,With all the powers of darkness. 'If the light
17652,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Do break upon me, by the grace of God,'"
17653,FLOS MERCATORUM,"So did he vow, 'O, then will I remember,"
17654,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Then, then, will I remember, ay, and help"
17655,FLOS MERCATORUM,To build that lovelier City which is paved
17656,FLOS MERCATORUM,"For rich and poor alike, with purest gold.'"
17657,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17658,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Ah, sirs, he kept his vow. Ye will not smile"
17659,FLOS MERCATORUM,"If, at the first, the best that he could do"
17660,FLOS MERCATORUM,Was with his first poor penny-piece to buy
17661,FLOS MERCATORUM,"A cat, and bring her home, under his coat"
17662,FLOS MERCATORUM,"By stealth (or else that termagant, the cook,"
17663,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Had drowned it in the water-butt, nor deemed"
17664,FLOS MERCATORUM,The water worse to drink). So did he quell
17665,FLOS MERCATORUM,"First his own plague, but bettered others, too."
17666,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Now, in those days, Marchaunt Adventurers"
17667,FLOS MERCATORUM,Shared with their prentices the happy chance
17668,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Of each new venture. Each might have his stake,"
17669,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Little or great, upon the glowing tides"
17670,FLOS MERCATORUM,Of high romance that washed the wharfs of Thames;
17671,FLOS MERCATORUM,And every lad in London had his groat
17672,FLOS MERCATORUM,Or splendid shilling on some fair ship at sea.
17673,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17674,FLOS MERCATORUM,"So, on an April eve, Fitzwarren called"
17675,FLOS MERCATORUM,"His prentices together; for, ere long,"
17676,FLOS MERCATORUM,"The _Unicorn_, his tall new ship, must sail"
17677,FLOS MERCATORUM,Beyond the world to gather gorgeous webs
17678,FLOS MERCATORUM,"From Eastern looms, great miracles of silk"
17679,FLOS MERCATORUM,Dipt in the dawn by wizard hands of Ind;
17680,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Or, if they chanced upon that fabled coast"
17681,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Where Sydon, river of jewels, like a snake"
17682,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Slides down the gorge its coils of crimson fire,"
17683,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Perchance a richer cargo,--rubies, pearls,"
17684,FLOS MERCATORUM,Or gold bars from the Gates of Paradise.
17685,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And many a moon, at least, a faërie foam"
17686,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Would lap Blackfriars wharf, where London lads"
17687,FLOS MERCATORUM,Gazed in the sunset down that misty reach
17688,FLOS MERCATORUM,For old black battered hulks and tattered sails
17689,FLOS MERCATORUM,Bringing their dreams home from the uncharted sea.
17690,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17691,FLOS MERCATORUM,And one flung down a groat--he had no more.
17692,FLOS MERCATORUM,"One staked a shilling, one a good French crown;"
17693,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And one an angel, O, light-winged enough"
17694,FLOS MERCATORUM,To reach Cathay; and not a lad but bought
17695,FLOS MERCATORUM,"His pennyworth of wonder,"
17696,FLOS MERCATORUM,"So they thought,"
17697,FLOS MERCATORUM,Till all at once Fitzwarren's daughter cried
17698,FLOS MERCATORUM,"'Father, you have forgot poor Whittington!'"
17699,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Snails,' laughed the rosy marchaunt, 'but that's true!"
17700,FLOS MERCATORUM,Fetch Whittington! The lad must stake his groat!
17701,FLOS MERCATORUM,'Twill bring us luck!'
17702,FLOS MERCATORUM,'Whittington! Whittington!'
17703,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Down the dark stair, like a gold-headed bird,"
17704,FLOS MERCATORUM,Fluttered sweet Alice. 'Whittington! Richard! Quick!
17705,FLOS MERCATORUM,Quick with your groat now for the _Unicorn_!'
17706,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17707,FLOS MERCATORUM,"'A groat!' cried Whittington, standing there aghast,"
17708,FLOS MERCATORUM,"With brown bare arms, still coloured by the sun,"
17709,FLOS MERCATORUM,Among his pots and pans. 'Where should I find
17710,FLOS MERCATORUM,A groat? I staked my last groat in a cat!'
17711,FLOS MERCATORUM,--'What! Have you nothing? Nothing but a cat?
17712,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Then stake the cat,' she said; and the quick fire"
17713,FLOS MERCATORUM,That in a woman's mind out-runs the thought
17714,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Of man, lit her grey eyes."
17715,FLOS MERCATORUM,Whittington laughed
17716,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And opened the cellar-door. Out sailed his wealth,"
17717,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Waving its tail, purring, and rubbing its head"
17718,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Now on his boots, now on the dainty shoe"
17719,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Of Alice, who straightway, deaf to his laughing prayers,"
17720,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Caught up the cat, whispered it, hugged it close,"
17721,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Against its grey fur leaned her glowing cheek,"
17722,FLOS MERCATORUM,And carried it off in triumph.
17723,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17724,FLOS MERCATORUM,_Red Rose Lane_
17725,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Echoed with laughter as, with amber eyes"
17726,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Blinking, the grey cat in a seaman's arms"
17727,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Went to the wharf. 'Ay, but we need a cat,'"
17728,FLOS MERCATORUM,"The captain said. So, when the painted ship"
17729,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Sailed through a golden sunrise down the Thames,"
17730,FLOS MERCATORUM,"A grey tail waved upon the misty poop,"
17731,FLOS MERCATORUM,And Whittington had his venture on the seas.
17732,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17733,FLOS MERCATORUM,"It was a nine days' jest, and soon forgot."
17734,FLOS MERCATORUM,"But, all that year,--ah, sirs, ye know the world,"
17735,FLOS MERCATORUM,"For all the foolish boasting of the proud,"
17736,FLOS MERCATORUM,Looks not beneath the coat of Taunton serge
17737,FLOS MERCATORUM,For Gules and Azure. A prince that comes in rags
17738,FLOS MERCATORUM,"To clean your shoes and, out of his own pride,"
17739,FLOS MERCATORUM,Waits for the world to paint his shield again
17740,FLOS MERCATORUM,Must wait for ever and a day.
17741,FLOS MERCATORUM,The world
17742,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Is a great hypocrite, hypocrite most of all"
17743,FLOS MERCATORUM,"When thus it boasts its purple pride of race,"
17744,FLOS MERCATORUM,Then with eyes blind to all but pride of place
17745,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Tramples the scullion's heraldry underfoot,"
17746,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Nay, never sees it, never dreams of it,"
17747,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Content to know that, here and now, his coat"
17748,FLOS MERCATORUM,Is greasy....
17749,FLOS MERCATORUM,So did Whittington find at last
17750,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Such nearness was most distant; that to see her,"
17751,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Talk with her, serve her thus, was but to lose"
17752,FLOS MERCATORUM,"True sight, true hearing.   He must save his life"
17753,FLOS MERCATORUM,"By losing it; forsake, to win, his love;"
17754,FLOS MERCATORUM,Go out into the world to bring her home.
17755,FLOS MERCATORUM,"It was but labour lost to clean the shoes,"
17756,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And turn the jack, and scour the dripping-pan."
17757,FLOS MERCATORUM,For every scolding blown about her ears
17758,FLOS MERCATORUM,The cook's great ladle fell upon the head
17759,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Of Whittington; who, beneath her rule, became"
17760,FLOS MERCATORUM,The scullery's general scapegoat.    It was he
17761,FLOS MERCATORUM,"That burned the pie-crust, drank the hippocras,"
17762,FLOS MERCATORUM,Dinted the silver beaker....
17763,FLOS MERCATORUM,Many a month
17764,FLOS MERCATORUM,"He chafed, till his resolve took sudden shape"
17765,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And, out of the dark house at the peep of day,"
17766,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Shouldering bundle and stick again, he stole"
17767,FLOS MERCATORUM,"To seek his freedom, and to shake the dust"
17768,FLOS MERCATORUM,Of London from his shoes....
17769,FLOS MERCATORUM,You know the stone
17770,FLOS MERCATORUM,"On Highgate, where he sate awhile to rest,"
17771,FLOS MERCATORUM,"With aching heart, and thought 'I shall not see"
17772,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Her face again.' There, as the coloured dawn"
17773,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Over the sleeping City slowly bloomed,"
17774,FLOS MERCATORUM,A small black battered ship with tattered sails
17775,FLOS MERCATORUM,Blurring the burnished glamour of the Thames
17776,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Crept, side-long to a wharf."
17777,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Then, all at once,"
17778,FLOS MERCATORUM,The London bells rang out a welcome home;
17779,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And, over them all, tossing the tenor on high,"
17780,FLOS MERCATORUM,"The Bell of Bow, a sun among the stars,"
17781,FLOS MERCATORUM,Flooded the morning air with this refrain:--
17782,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17783,FLOS MERCATORUM,"'Turn again, Whittington! Turn again, Whittington!"
17784,FLOS MERCATORUM,"_Flos Mercatorum_, thy ship hath come home!"
17785,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Trailing from her cross-trees the crimson of the sunrise,"
17786,FLOS MERCATORUM,Dragging all the glory of the sunset thro' the foam.
17787,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Turn again, Whittington,"
17788,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Turn again, Whittington,"
17789,FLOS MERCATORUM,Lord Mayor of London!
17790,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17791,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Turn again, Whittington! When thy hope was darkest,"
17792,FLOS MERCATORUM,Far beyond the sky-line a ship sailed for thee.
17793,FLOS MERCATORUM,"_Flos Mercatorum_, O, when thy faith was blindest,"
17794,FLOS MERCATORUM,Even then thy sails were set beyond the Ocean-sea.'
17795,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17796,FLOS MERCATORUM,"So he heard and heeded us, and turned again to London,"
17797,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Stick and bundle on his back, he turned to _Red Rose Lane_,"
17798,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Hardly hearing as he went the chatter of the prentices,--"
17799,FLOS MERCATORUM,"_What d'ye lack, and what d'ye lack, and what d'ye lack again?_"
17800,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17801,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Back into the scullery, before the cook had missed him,"
17802,FLOS MERCATORUM,Early in the morning his labours he began:
17803,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Once again to clean the shoes and clatter with the water-pail,"
17804,FLOS MERCATORUM,Once again to scrub the jack and scour the dripping-pan.
17805,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17806,FLOS MERCATORUM,All the bells of London were pealing as he laboured.
17807,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Wildly beat his heart, and his blood began to race."
17808,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Then--there came a light step and, suddenly, beside him"
17809,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Stood his lady Alice, with a light upon her face."
17810,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17811,FLOS MERCATORUM,"'Quick,' she said, 'O, quick,' she said, 'they want you,"
17812,FLOS MERCATORUM,Richard Whittington!'
17813,FLOS MERCATORUM,"'Quick,' she said; and, while she spoke, her lighted eyes betrayed"
17814,FLOS MERCATORUM,"All that she had hidden long, and all she still would hide from him."
17815,FLOS MERCATORUM,"So--he turned and followed her, his green-gowned maid."
17816,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17817,FLOS MERCATORUM,*   *   *   *
17818,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17819,FLOS MERCATORUM,"There, in a broad dark oaken-panelled room"
17820,FLOS MERCATORUM,Rich with black carvings and great gleaming cups
17821,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Of silver, sirs, and massy halpace built"
17822,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Half over _Red Rose Lane_, Fitzwarren sat;"
17823,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And, at his side, O, like an old romance"
17824,FLOS MERCATORUM,That suddenly comes true and fills the world
17825,FLOS MERCATORUM,"With April colours, two bronzed seamen stood,"
17826,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Tattered and scarred, and stained with sun and brine."
17827,FLOS MERCATORUM,"'_Flos Mercatorum_,' Hugh Fitzwarren cried,"
17828,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Holding both hands out to the pale-faced boy,"
17829,FLOS MERCATORUM,"'The prentice wins the prize! Why, Whittington,"
17830,FLOS MERCATORUM,Thy cat hath caught the biggest mouse of all!'
17831,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And, on to the table, tilting a heavy sack,"
17832,FLOS MERCATORUM,One of the seamen poured a glittering stream
17833,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Of rubies, emeralds, opals, amethysts,"
17834,FLOS MERCATORUM,"That turned the room to an Aladdin's cave,"
17835,FLOS MERCATORUM,Or magic goblet brimmed with dusky wine
17836,FLOS MERCATORUM,Where clustering rainbow-coloured bubbles clung
17837,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And sparkled, in the halls of Prester John."
17838,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17839,FLOS MERCATORUM,"'And that,' said Hugh Fitzwarren, 'is the price"
17840,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Paid for your cat in Barbary, by a King"
17841,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Whose house was rich in gems, but sorely plagued"
17842,FLOS MERCATORUM,"With rats and mice. Gather it up, my lad,"
17843,FLOS MERCATORUM,And praise your master for his honesty;
17844,FLOS MERCATORUM,"For, though my cargo prospered, yours outshines"
17845,FLOS MERCATORUM,"The best of it. Take it, my lad, and go;"
17846,FLOS MERCATORUM,"You're a rich man; and, if you use it well,"
17847,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Riches will make you richer, and the world"
17848,FLOS MERCATORUM,Will prosper in your own prosperity.
17849,FLOS MERCATORUM,"The miser, like the cold and barren moon,"
17850,FLOS MERCATORUM,Shines with a fruitless light. The spendthrift fool
17851,FLOS MERCATORUM,Flits like a Jack-o-Lent over quags and fens;
17852,FLOS MERCATORUM,But he that's wisely rich gathers his gold
17853,FLOS MERCATORUM,Into a fruitful and unwasting sun
17854,FLOS MERCATORUM,That spends its glory on a thousand fields
17855,FLOS MERCATORUM,And blesses all the world. Take it and go.'
17856,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17857,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Blankly, as in a dream, Whittington stared."
17858,FLOS MERCATORUM,"'How should I take it, sir? The ship was yours,"
17859,FLOS MERCATORUM,And ...'
17860,FLOS MERCATORUM,"'Ay, the ship was mine; but in that ship"
17861,FLOS MERCATORUM,Your stake was richer than we knew. 'Tis yours.'
17862,FLOS MERCATORUM,"'Then,' answered Whittington, 'if this wealth be mine,"
17863,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Who but an hour ago was all so poor,"
17864,FLOS MERCATORUM,I know one way to make me richer still.'
17865,FLOS MERCATORUM,"He gathered up the glittering sack of gems,"
17866,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Turned to the halpace, where his green-gowned maid"
17867,FLOS MERCATORUM,Stood in the glory of the coloured panes.
17868,FLOS MERCATORUM,"He thrust the splendid load into her arms,"
17869,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Muttering--'Take it, lady! Let me be poor!"
17870,FLOS MERCATORUM,"But rich, at least, in that you not despise"
17871,FLOS MERCATORUM,The waif you saved.'
17872,FLOS MERCATORUM,"--'Despise you, Whittington?'--"
17873,FLOS MERCATORUM,"'O, no, not in the sight of God! But I"
17874,FLOS MERCATORUM,Grow tired of waiting for the Judgment Day!
17875,FLOS MERCATORUM,I am but a man. I am a scullion now;
17876,FLOS MERCATORUM,"But I would like, only for half an hour,"
17877,FLOS MERCATORUM,"To stand upright and say ""I am a king!"""
17878,FLOS MERCATORUM,Take it!'
17879,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And, as they stood, a little apart,"
17880,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Their eyes were married in one swift level look,"
17881,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Silent, but all that souls could say was said."
17882,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17883,FLOS MERCATORUM,*   *   *   *
17884,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17885,FLOS MERCATORUM,And
17886,FLOS MERCATORUM,"'I know a way,' said the Bell of St. Martin's."
17887,FLOS MERCATORUM,"'Tell it, and be quick,' laughed the prentices below!"
17888,FLOS MERCATORUM,"'Whittington shall marry her, marry her, marry her!"
17889,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Peal for a wedding,' said the big Bell of Bow."
17890,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17891,FLOS MERCATORUM,"He shall take a kingdom up, and cast it on the sea again;"
17892,FLOS MERCATORUM,He shall have his caravels to traffic for him now;
17893,FLOS MERCATORUM,"He shall see his royal sails rolling up from Araby,"
17894,FLOS MERCATORUM,And the crest--a honey-bee--golden at the prow.
17895,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17896,FLOS MERCATORUM,Whittington! Whittington! The world is all a fairy tale!--
17897,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Even so we sang for him.--But O, the tale is true!"
17898,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Whittington he married her, and on his merry marriage-day,"
17899,FLOS MERCATORUM,"O, we sang, we sang for him, like lavrocks in the blue."
17900,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17901,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Far away from London, these happy prentice lovers"
17902,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Wandered through the fern to his western home again,"
17903,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Down by deep Dorset to the wooded isle of Purbeck,"
17904,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Round to little Kimmeridge, by many a lover's lane."
17905,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17906,FLOS MERCATORUM,There did they abide as in a dove-cote hidden
17907,FLOS MERCATORUM,Deep in happy woods until the bells of duty rang;
17908,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Then they rode the way he went, a barefoot boy to London,"
17909,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Round by Hampshire forest-roads, but as they rode he sang:--"
17910,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17911,FLOS MERCATORUM,_Kimmeridge in Dorset is the happiest of places!
17912,FLOS MERCATORUM,All the little homesteads are thatched with beauty there!
17913,FLOS MERCATORUM,"All the old ploughmen, there, have happy smiling faces,"
17914,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Christmas roses in their cheeks, and crowns of silver hair."
17915,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17916,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Blue as are the eggs in the nest of the hedge-sparrow,"
17917,FLOS MERCATORUM,Gleam the little rooms in the homestead that I know:
17918,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Death, I think, has lost the way to Kimmeridge in Dorset;"
17919,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Sorrow never knew it, or forgot it, long ago!"
17920,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17921,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Kimmeridge in Dorset, Kimmeridge in Dorset,"
17922,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Though I may not see you more thro' all the years to be,"
17923,FLOS MERCATORUM,Yet will I remember the little happy homestead
17924,FLOS MERCATORUM,Hidden in that Paradise where God was good to me._
17925,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17926,FLOS MERCATORUM,*   *   *   *
17927,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17928,FLOS MERCATORUM,"So they turned to London, and with mind and soul he laboured,"
17929,FLOS MERCATORUM,"_Flos Mercatorum_, for the mighty years to be,"
17930,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Fashioning, for profit--to the years that should forget him!--"
17931,FLOS MERCATORUM,"This, our sacred City that must shine upon the sea."
17932,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17933,FLOS MERCATORUM,London was a City when the Poulters ruled the Poultry!
17934,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Rosaries of prayer were hung in Paternoster Row,"
17935,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Gutter Lane was Guthrun's, then; and, bright with painted missal-books,"
17936,FLOS MERCATORUM,"_Ave Mary Corner_, sirs, was fairer than ye know."
17937,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17938,FLOS MERCATORUM,"London was mighty when her marchaunts loved their merchandise,"
17939,FLOS MERCATORUM,Bales of Eastern magic that empurpled wharf and quay:
17940,FLOS MERCATORUM,"London was mighty when her booths were a dream-market,"
17941,FLOS MERCATORUM,Loaded with the colours of the sunset and the sea.
17942,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17943,FLOS MERCATORUM,"There, in all their glory, with the Virgin on their bannerols,"
17944,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Glory out of Genoa, the Mercers might be seen,"
17945,FLOS MERCATORUM,Walking to their Company of Marchaunt Adventurers;--
17946,FLOS MERCATORUM,Gallantly they jetted it in scarlet and in green.
17947,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17948,FLOS MERCATORUM,"There, in all the glory of the lordly Linen Armourers,"
17949,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Walked the Marchaunt Taylors with the Pilgrim of their trade,"
17950,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Fresh from adventuring in Italy and Flanders,"
17951,FLOS MERCATORUM,"_Flos Mercatorum_, for a green-gowned maid."
17952,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17953,FLOS MERCATORUM,_Flos Mercatorum!_ Can a good thing come of Nazareth?
17954,FLOS MERCATORUM,"High above the darkness, where our duller senses drown,"
17955,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Lifts the splendid Vision of a City, built on merchandise,"
17956,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Fairer than that City of Light that wore the violet crown,"
17957,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17958,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Lifts the sacred vision of a far-resplendent City,"
17959,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Flashing, like the heart of heaven, its messages afar,"
17960,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Trafficking, as God Himself through all His interchanging worlds,"
17961,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Holding up the scales of law, weighing star by star,"
17962,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17963,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Stern as Justice, in one hand the sword of Truth and Righteousness;"
17964,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Blind as Justice, in one hand the everlasting scales,"
17965,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Lifts the sacred Vision of that City from the darkness,"
17966,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Whence the thoughts of men break out, like blossoms, or like sails!"
17967,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17968,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Ordered and harmonious, a City built to music,"
17969,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Lifting, out of chaos, the shining towers of law,--"
17970,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Ay, a sacred City, and a City built of merchandise,"
17971,FLOS MERCATORUM,"_Flos Mercatorum_, was the City that he saw."
17972,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17973,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And by that light,"" quoth Clopton, ""did he keep"
17974,FLOS MERCATORUM,His promise. He was rich; but in his will
17975,FLOS MERCATORUM,He wrote those words which should be blazed with gold
17976,FLOS MERCATORUM,In London's _Liber Albus_:--
17977,FLOS MERCATORUM,
17978,FLOS MERCATORUM,_The desire
17979,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And busy intention of a man, devout"
17980,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And wise, should be to fore-cast and secure"
17981,FLOS MERCATORUM,The state and end of this short life with deeds
17982,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Of mercy and pity, especially to provide"
17983,FLOS MERCATORUM,"For those whom poverty insulteth, those"
17984,FLOS MERCATORUM,To whom the power of labouring for the needs
17985,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Of life, is interdicted._"
17986,FLOS MERCATORUM,He became
17987,FLOS MERCATORUM,The Father of the City. Felons died
17988,FLOS MERCATORUM,Of fever in old Newgate. He rebuilt
17989,FLOS MERCATORUM,"The prison. London sickened, from the lack"
17990,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Of water, and he made fresh fountains flow."
17991,FLOS MERCATORUM,"He heard the cry of suffering and disease,"
17992,FLOS MERCATORUM,And built the stately hospital that still
17993,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Shines like an angel's lanthorn through the night,"
17994,FLOS MERCATORUM,The stately halls of St. Bartholomew.
17995,FLOS MERCATORUM,"He saw men wrapt in ignorance, and he raised"
17996,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Schools, colleges, and libraries. He heard"
17997,FLOS MERCATORUM,"The cry of the old and weary, and he built"
17998,FLOS MERCATORUM,Houses of refuge.
17999,FLOS MERCATORUM,Even so he kept
18000,FLOS MERCATORUM,"His prentice vows of Duty, Industry,"
18001,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Obedience, words contemned of every fool"
18002,FLOS MERCATORUM,Who shrinks from law; yet were those ancient vows
18003,FLOS MERCATORUM,The adamantine pillars of the State.
18004,FLOS MERCATORUM,Let all who play their Samson be well warned
18005,FLOS MERCATORUM,"That Samsons perish, too!"
18006,FLOS MERCATORUM,His monument
18007,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Is London!"""
18008,FLOS MERCATORUM,
18009,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""True,"" quoth Dekker, ""and he deserves"
18010,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Well of the Mermaid Inn for one good law,"
18011,FLOS MERCATORUM,Rightly enforced. He pilloried that rogue
18012,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Will Horold, who in Whittington's third year"
18013,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Of office, as Lord Mayor, placed certain gums"
18014,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And spices in great casks, and filled them up"
18015,FLOS MERCATORUM,"With feeble Spanish wine, to have the taste"
18016,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And smell of Romeney,--Malmsey!"""
18017,FLOS MERCATORUM,"""Honest wine,"
18018,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Indeed,"" replied the Clerk, ""concerns the State,"
18019,FLOS MERCATORUM,"That solemn structure touched with light from heaven,"
18020,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Which he, our merchant, helped to build on earth."
18021,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And, while he laboured for it, all things else"
18022,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Were added unto him, until the bells"
18023,FLOS MERCATORUM,More than fulfilled their prophecy.
18024,FLOS MERCATORUM,"One great eve,"
18025,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Fair Alice, leaning from her casement, saw"
18026,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Another Watch, and mightier than the first,"
18027,FLOS MERCATORUM,Billowing past the newly painted doors
18028,FLOS MERCATORUM,Of Whittington Palace--so men called his house
18029,FLOS MERCATORUM,"In Hart Street, fifteen yards from old Mark Lane,--"
18030,FLOS MERCATORUM,thousand burganets and halberdiers;
18031,FLOS MERCATORUM,"A thousand archers in their white silk coats,"
18032,FLOS MERCATORUM,"A thousand mounted men in ringing mail,"
18033,FLOS MERCATORUM,"A thousand sworded henchmen; then, his Guild,"
18034,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Advancing, on their splendid bannerols"
18035,FLOS MERCATORUM,"The Virgin, glorious in gold; and then,"
18036,FLOS MERCATORUM,"_Flos Mercatorum_, on his great stirring steed"
18037,FLOS MERCATORUM,Whittington! On that night he made a feast
18038,FLOS MERCATORUM,For London and the King. His feasting hall
18039,FLOS MERCATORUM,Gleamed like the magic cave that Prester John
18040,FLOS MERCATORUM,Wrought out of one huge opal. East and West
18041,FLOS MERCATORUM,Lavished their wealth on that great Citizen
18042,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Who, when the King from Agincourt returned"
18043,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Victorious, but with empty coffers, lent"
18044,FLOS MERCATORUM,Three times the ransom of an Emperor
18045,FLOS MERCATORUM,"To fill them--on the royal bond, and said"
18046,FLOS MERCATORUM,"When the King questioned him of how and whence,"
18047,FLOS MERCATORUM,"'I am the steward of your City, sire!"
18048,FLOS MERCATORUM,"There is a sea, and who shall drain it dry?'"
18049,FLOS MERCATORUM,
18050,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Over the roasted swans and peacock pies,"
18051,FLOS MERCATORUM,The minstrels in the great black gallery tuned
18052,FLOS MERCATORUM,"All hearts to mirth, until it seemed their cups"
18053,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Were brimmed with dawn and sunset, and they drank"
18054,FLOS MERCATORUM,"The wine of gods. Lord of a hundred ships,"
18055,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Under the feet of England, Whittington flung"
18056,FLOS MERCATORUM,"The purple of the seas. And when the Queen,"
18057,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Catharine, wondered at the costly woods"
18058,FLOS MERCATORUM,"That burned upon his hearth, the Marchaunt rose,"
18059,FLOS MERCATORUM,"He drew the great sealed parchments from his breast,"
18060,FLOS MERCATORUM,"The bonds the King had given him on his loans,"
18061,FLOS MERCATORUM,Loans that might drain the Mediterranean dry.
18062,FLOS MERCATORUM,"'They call us hucksters, madam, we that love"
18063,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Our City,' and, into the red-hot heart of the fire,"
18064,FLOS MERCATORUM,He tossed the bonds of sixty thousand pounds.
18065,FLOS MERCATORUM,"'The fire burns low,' said Richard Whittington."
18066,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Then, overhead, the minstrels plucked their strings;"
18067,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And, over the clash of wine-cups, rose a song"
18068,FLOS MERCATORUM,That made the old timbers of their feasting-hall
18069,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Shake, as a galleon shakes in a gale of wind,"
18070,FLOS MERCATORUM,When she rolls glorying through the Ocean-sea:--
18071,FLOS MERCATORUM,
18072,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Marchaunt Adventurers, O, what shall it profit you"
18073,FLOS MERCATORUM,Thus to seek your kingdom in the dream-destroying sun?
18074,FLOS MERCATORUM,Ask us why the hawthorn brightens on the sky-line:
18075,FLOS MERCATORUM,Even so our sails break out when Spring is well begun!
18076,FLOS MERCATORUM,"_Flos Mercatorum!_ Blossom wide, ye sail of Englande,"
18077,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Hasten ye the kingdom, now the bitter days are done!"
18078,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Ay, for we be members, one of another,"
18079,FLOS MERCATORUM,"'Each for all and all for each,' quoth Richard Whittington!"
18080,FLOS MERCATORUM,
18081,FLOS MERCATORUM,"_Chorus:_--Marchaunt Adventurers,"
18082,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Marchaunt Adventurers,"
18083,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Marchaunt Adventurers, the Spring is well begun!"
18084,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Break, break out on every sea, O, fair white sails of Englande!"
18085,FLOS MERCATORUM,"'Each for all, and all for each,' quoth Richard Whittington."
18086,FLOS MERCATORUM,
18087,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Marchaunt Adventurers, O what 'ull ye bring home again?"
18088,FLOS MERCATORUM,Woonders and works and the thunder of the sea!
18089,FLOS MERCATORUM,Whom will ye traffic with? The King of the sunset!--
18090,FLOS MERCATORUM,"What shall be your pilot, then?--A wind from Galilee!"
18091,FLOS MERCATORUM,
18092,FLOS MERCATORUM,"--Nay, but ye be marchaunts, will ye come back empty-handed?--"
18093,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Ay, we be marchaunts, though our gain we ne'er shall see!"
18094,FLOS MERCATORUM,Cast we now our bread upon the waste wild waters;
18095,FLOS MERCATORUM,After many days it shall return with usury.
18096,FLOS MERCATORUM,
18097,FLOS MERCATORUM,"_Chorus:_--Marchaunt Adventurers,"
18098,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Marchaunt Adventurers,"
18099,FLOS MERCATORUM,What shall be your profit in the mighty days to be?
18100,FLOS MERCATORUM,Englande! Englande! Englande! Englande!
18101,FLOS MERCATORUM,Glory everlasting and the lordship of the sea.
18102,FLOS MERCATORUM,
18103,FLOS MERCATORUM,"What need to tell you, sirs, how Whittington"
18104,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Remembered? Night and morning, as he knelt"
18105,FLOS MERCATORUM,"In those old days, O, like two children still,"
18106,FLOS MERCATORUM,Whittington and his Alice bowed their heads
18107,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Together, praying."
18108,FLOS MERCATORUM,"From such simple hearts,"
18109,FLOS MERCATORUM,"O never doubt it, though the whole world doubt"
18110,FLOS MERCATORUM,"The God that made it, came the steadfast strength"
18111,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Of England, all that once was her strong soul,"
18112,FLOS MERCATORUM,The soul that laughed and shook away defeat
18113,FLOS MERCATORUM,As her strong cliffs hurl back the streaming seas.
18114,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Sirs, in his old age Whittington returned,"
18115,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And stood with Alice, by the silent tomb"
18116,FLOS MERCATORUM,In little Pauntley church.
18117,FLOS MERCATORUM,"There, to his Arms,"
18118,FLOS MERCATORUM,"The Gules and Azure, and the Lion's Head"
18119,FLOS MERCATORUM,So proudly blazoned on the painted panes;
18120,FLOS MERCATORUM,"(O, sirs, the simple wistfulness of it"
18121,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Might move hard hearts to laughter, but I think"
18122,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Tears tremble through it, for the Mermaid Inn)"
18123,FLOS MERCATORUM,"He added his new crest, the hard-won sign"
18124,FLOS MERCATORUM,"And lowly prize of his own industry,"
18125,FLOS MERCATORUM,"_The Honey-bee_. And, far away, the bells"
18126,FLOS MERCATORUM,Peal softly from the pure white City of God:--
18127,FLOS MERCATORUM,_Ut fragrans nardus
18128,FLOS MERCATORUM,Fama fuit iste Ricardus._
18129,FLOS MERCATORUM,With folded hands he waits the Judgment now.
18130,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Slowly our dark bells toll across the world,"
18131,FLOS MERCATORUM,"For him who waits the reckoning, his accompt"
18132,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Secure, his conscience clear, his ledger spread"
18133,FLOS MERCATORUM,A _Liber Albus_ flooded with pure light.
18134,FLOS MERCATORUM,
18135,FLOS MERCATORUM,"_Flos Mercatorum,"
18136,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Fundator presbyterorum_,..."
18137,FLOS MERCATORUM,
18138,FLOS MERCATORUM,Slowly the dark bells toll for him who asks
18139,FLOS MERCATORUM,"No more of men, but that they may sometimes"
18140,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Pray for the souls of Richard Whittington,"
18141,FLOS MERCATORUM,"Alice, his wife, and (as themselves of old"
18142,FLOS MERCATORUM,Had prayed) the father and mother of each of them.
18143,FLOS MERCATORUM,Slowly the great notes fall and float away:--
18144,FLOS MERCATORUM,

18155,RALEIGH,RALEIGH
18156,RALEIGH,
18157,RALEIGH,Ben was our only guest that day. His tribe
18158,RALEIGH,"Had flown to their new shrine--the Apollo Room,"
18159,RALEIGH,"To which, though they enscrolled his golden verse"
18160,RALEIGH,"Above their doors like some great-fruited vine,"
18161,RALEIGH,"Ben still preferred our _Mermaid_, and to smoke"
18162,RALEIGH,Alone in his old nook; perhaps to hear
18163,RALEIGH,"The voices of the dead,"
18164,RALEIGH,The voices of his old companions.
18165,RALEIGH,"Hovering near him,--Will and Kit and Rob."
18166,RALEIGH,
18167,RALEIGH,"""Our Ocean-shepherd from the Main-deep sea,"
18168,RALEIGH,"Raleigh,"" he muttered, as I brimmed his cup,"
18169,RALEIGH,"""Last of the men that broke the fleets of Spain,"
18170,RALEIGH,"'Twas not enough to cage him, sixteen years,"
18171,RALEIGH,"Rotting his heart out in the Bloody Tower,"
18172,RALEIGH,But they must fling him forth in his old age
18173,RALEIGH,"To hunt for El Dorado. Then, mine host,"
18174,RALEIGH,Because his poor old ship _The Destiny_
18175,RALEIGH,"Smashes the Spaniard, but comes tottering home"
18176,RALEIGH,"Without the Spanish gold, our gracious king,"
18177,RALEIGH,"To please a catamite,"
18178,RALEIGH,Sends the old lion back to the Tower again.
18179,RALEIGH,The friends of Spain will send him to the block
18180,RALEIGH,"This time. That male Salome, Buckingham,"
18181,RALEIGH,"Is dancing for his head. Raleigh is doomed."""
18182,RALEIGH,A shadow stood in the doorway. We looked up;
18183,RALEIGH,"And there, but O, how changed, how worn and grey,"
18184,RALEIGH,"Sir Walter Raleigh, like a hunted thing,"
18185,RALEIGH,Stared at us.
18186,RALEIGH,
18187,RALEIGH,"""Ben,"" he said, and glanced behind him."
18188,RALEIGH,Ben took a step towards him.
18189,RALEIGH,"""O, my God,"
18190,RALEIGH,"Ben,"" whispered the old man in a husky voice,"
18191,RALEIGH,"Half timorous and half cunning, so unlike"
18192,RALEIGH,His old heroic self that one might weep
18193,RALEIGH,"To hear it, ""Ben, I have given them all the slip!"
18194,RALEIGH,I may be followed. Can you hide me here
18195,RALEIGH,"Till it grows dark?"""
18196,RALEIGH,"Ben drew him quickly in, and motioned me"
18197,RALEIGH,"To lock the door. ""Till it grows dark,"" he cried,"
18198,RALEIGH,"""My God, that you should ask it!"""
18199,RALEIGH,"""Do not think,"
18200,RALEIGH,"Do not believe that I am quite disgraced,"""
18201,RALEIGH,"The old man faltered, ""for they'll say it, Ben;"
18202,RALEIGH,"And when my boy grows up, they'll tell him, too,"
18203,RALEIGH,His father was a coward. I do cling
18204,RALEIGH,"To life for many reasons, not from fear"
18205,RALEIGH,"Of death. No, Ben, I can disdain that still;"
18206,RALEIGH,"But--there's my boy!"""
18207,RALEIGH,Then all his face went blind.
18208,RALEIGH,"He dropt upon Ben's shoulder and sobbed outright,"
18209,RALEIGH,"""They are trying to break my pride, to break my pride!"""
18210,RALEIGH,"The window darkened, and I saw a face"
18211,RALEIGH,"Blurring the panes. Ben gripped the old man's arm,"
18212,RALEIGH,"And led him gently to a room within,"
18213,RALEIGH,Out of the way of guests.
18214,RALEIGH,"""Your pride,"" he said,"
18215,RALEIGH,"""That is the pride of England!"""
18216,RALEIGH,At that name--
18217,RALEIGH,_England!_--
18218,RALEIGH,"As at a signal-gun, heard in the night"
18219,RALEIGH,"Far out at sea, the weather and world-worn man,"
18220,RALEIGH,"That once was Raleigh, lifted up his head."
18221,RALEIGH,"Old age and weakness, weariness and fear"
18222,RALEIGH,Fell from him like a cloak. He stood erect.
18223,RALEIGH,"His eager eyes, full of great sea-washed dawns,"
18224,RALEIGH,"Burned for a moment with immortal youth,"
18225,RALEIGH,While tears blurred mine to see him.
18226,RALEIGH,"""You do think"
18227,RALEIGH,"That England will remember? You do think it?"""
18228,RALEIGH,He asked with a great light upon his face.
18229,RALEIGH,Ben bowed his head in silence.
18230,RALEIGH,
18231,RALEIGH,*   *   *   *
18232,RALEIGH,
18233,RALEIGH,"""I have wronged"
18234,RALEIGH,"My cause by this,"" said Raleigh. ""Well they know it"
18235,RALEIGH,Who left this way for me. I have flung myself
18236,RALEIGH,Like a blind moth into this deadly light
18237,RALEIGH,"Of freedom. Now, at the eleventh hour,"
18238,RALEIGH,"Is it too late? I might return and--"""
18239,RALEIGH,"""No!"
18240,RALEIGH,"Not now!"" Ben interrupted. ""I'd have said"
18241,RALEIGH,"Laugh at the headsman sixteen years ago,"
18242,RALEIGH,When England was awake. She will awake
18243,RALEIGH,"Again. But now, while our most gracious king,"
18244,RALEIGH,"Who hates tobacco, dedicates his prayers"
18245,RALEIGH,To Buckingham--
18246,RALEIGH,"This is no land for men that, under God,"
18247,RALEIGH,"Shattered the Fleet Invincible."""
18248,RALEIGH,A knock
18249,RALEIGH,"Startled us, at the outer door. ""My friend"
18250,RALEIGH,"Stukeley,"" said Raleigh, ""if I know his hand."
18251,RALEIGH,"He has a ketch will carry me to France,"
18252,RALEIGH,"Waiting at Tilbury."""
18253,RALEIGH,"I let him in,--"
18254,RALEIGH,"A lean and stealthy fellow, Sir Lewis Stukeley,--"
18255,RALEIGH,"liked him little. He thought much of his health,"
18256,RALEIGH,"More of his money bags, and most of all"
18257,RALEIGH,On how to run with all men all at once
18258,RALEIGH,For his own profit. At the _Mermaid Inn_
18259,RALEIGH,Men disagreed in friendship and in truth;
18260,RALEIGH,"But he agreed with all men, and his life"
18261,RALEIGH,Was one soft quag of falsehood. Fugitives
18262,RALEIGH,"Must use false keys, I thought; and there was hope"
18263,RALEIGH,For Raleigh if such a man would walk one mile
18264,RALEIGH,To serve him now. Yet my throat moved to see him
18265,RALEIGH,"Usurping, with one hand on Raleigh's arm,"
18266,RALEIGH,"A kind of ownership. ""_Lend me ten pounds_,"""
18267,RALEIGH,"Were the first words he breathed in the old man's ear,"
18268,RALEIGH,And Raleigh slipped his purse into his hand.
18269,RALEIGH,
18270,RALEIGH,*   *   *   *
18271,RALEIGH,
18272,RALEIGH,Just over Bread Street hung the bruised white moon
18273,RALEIGH,"When they crept out. Sir Lewis Stukeley's watch-dog,"
18274,RALEIGH,"A derelict bo'sun, with a mulberry face,"
18275,RALEIGH,"Met them outside. ""The coast quite clear, eh, Hart?"""
18276,RALEIGH,"Said Stukeley. ""Ah, that's good. Lead on, then, quick."""
18277,RALEIGH,"And there, framed in the cruddle of moonlit clouds"
18278,RALEIGH,"That ended the steep street, dark on its light,"
18279,RALEIGH,And standing on those glistening cobblestones
18280,RALEIGH,"Just where they turned to silver, Raleigh looked back"
18281,RALEIGH,Before he turned the corner. He stood there.
18282,RALEIGH,"A figure like foot-feathered Mercury,"
18283,RALEIGH,"Tall, straight and splendid, waving his plumed hat"
18284,RALEIGH,"To Ben, and taking his last look, I felt,"
18285,RALEIGH,"Upon our _Mermaid Tavern_. As he paused,"
18286,RALEIGH,His long fantastic shadow swayed and swept
18287,RALEIGH,"Against our feet. Then, like a shadow, he passed."
18288,RALEIGH,
18289,RALEIGH,"""It is not right,"" said Ben, ""it is not right."
18290,RALEIGH,Why did they give the old man so much grace?
18291,RALEIGH,Witness and evidence are what they lack.
18292,RALEIGH,Would you trust Stukeley--not to draw him out?
18293,RALEIGH,Raleigh was always rash. A phrase or two
18294,RALEIGH,Will turn their murderous axe into a sword
18295,RALEIGH,Of righteousness--
18296,RALEIGH,
18297,RALEIGH,"Why, come to think of it,"
18298,RALEIGH,"Blackfriar's Wharf, last night, I landed there,"
18299,RALEIGH,"And--no, by God!--Raleigh is not himself,"
18300,RALEIGH,The tide will never serve beyond Gravesend.
18301,RALEIGH,It is a trap! Come on! We'll follow them!
18302,RALEIGH,"Quick! To the river side!""--"
18303,RALEIGH,We reached the wharf
18304,RALEIGH,"Only to see their wherry, a small black cloud"
18305,RALEIGH,Dwindling far down that running silver road.
18306,RALEIGH,Ben touched my arm.
18307,RALEIGH,"""Look there,"" he said, pointing up-stream."
18308,RALEIGH,The moon
18309,RALEIGH,"Glanced on a cluster of pikes, like silver thorns,"
18310,RALEIGH,"Three hundred yards away, a little troop"
18311,RALEIGH,"Of weaponed men, embarking hurriedly."
18312,RALEIGH,"Their great black wherry clumsily swung about,"
18313,RALEIGH,"Then, with twelve oars for legs, came striding down,"
18314,RALEIGH,An armoured beetle on the glittering trail
18315,RALEIGH,Of some small victim.
18316,RALEIGH,Just below our wharf
18317,RALEIGH,A little dinghy waddled.
18318,RALEIGH,"Ben cut the painter, and without one word"
18319,RALEIGH,"Drew her up crackling thro' the lapping water,"
18320,RALEIGH,"Motioned me to the tiller, thrust her off,"
18321,RALEIGH,"And, pulling with one oar, backing with the other,"
18322,RALEIGH,"Swirled her round and down, hard on the track"
18323,RALEIGH,"Of Raleigh. Ben was an old man now but tough,"
18324,RALEIGH,O tough as a buccaneer. We distanced them.
18325,RALEIGH,His oar blades drove the silver boiling back.
18326,RALEIGH,By Broken Wharf the beetle was a speck.
18327,RALEIGH,It dwindled by Queen Hythe and the Three Cranes.
18328,RALEIGH,"By Bellyn's Gate we had left it, out of sight."
18329,RALEIGH,By Custom House and Galley Keye we shot
18330,RALEIGH,"Thro' silver all the way, without one glimpse"
18331,RALEIGH,Of Raleigh. Then a dreadful shadow fell
18332,RALEIGH,And over us the Tower of London rose
18333,RALEIGH,"Like ebony; and, on the glittering reach"
18334,RALEIGH,"Beyond it, I could see the small black cloud"
18335,RALEIGH,That carried the great old seaman slowly down
18336,RALEIGH,Between the dark shores whence in happier years
18337,RALEIGH,"The throng had cheered his golden galleons out,"
18338,RALEIGH,And watched his proud sails filling for Cathay.
18339,RALEIGH,"There, as through lead, we dragged by Traitor's Gate,"
18340,RALEIGH,"There, in the darkness, under the Bloody Tower,"
18341,RALEIGH,"There, on the very verge of victory,"
18342,RALEIGH,Ben gasped and dropped his oars.
18343,RALEIGH,"""Take one and row,"" he said, ""my arms are numbed."
18344,RALEIGH,"We'll overtake him yet!"" I clambered past him,"
18345,RALEIGH,And took the bow oar.
18346,RALEIGH,
18347,RALEIGH,"Once, as the pace flagged,"
18348,RALEIGH,Over his shoulder he turned his great scarred face
18349,RALEIGH,"And snarled, with a trickle of blood on his coarse lips,"
18350,RALEIGH,"""Hard!""--"
18351,RALEIGH,"And blood and fire ran through my veins again,"
18352,RALEIGH,For half a minute more.
18353,RALEIGH,
18354,RALEIGH,Yet we fell back.
18355,RALEIGH,Our course was crooked now. And suddenly
18356,RALEIGH,"A grim black speck began to grow behind us,"
18357,RALEIGH,Grow like the threat of death upon old age.
18358,RALEIGH,"Then, thickening, blackening, sharpening, foaming, swept"
18359,RALEIGH,"Up the bright line of bubbles in our wake,"
18360,RALEIGH,"That armoured wherry, with its long twelve oars"
18361,RALEIGH,All well together now.
18362,RALEIGH,
18363,RALEIGH,"""Too late,"" gasped Ben,"
18364,RALEIGH,"His ash-grey face uplifted to the moon,"
18365,RALEIGH,"One quivering hand upon the thwart behind him,"
18366,RALEIGH,A moment. Then he bowed over his knees
18367,RALEIGH,"Coughing. ""But we'll delay them. We'll be drunk,"
18368,RALEIGH,"And hold the catch-polls up!"""
18369,RALEIGH,
18370,RALEIGH,We drifted down
18371,RALEIGH,"Before them, broadside on. They sheered aside."
18372,RALEIGH,"Then, feigning a clumsy stroke, Ben drove our craft"
18373,RALEIGH,"As they drew level, right in among their blades."
18374,RALEIGH,"There was a shout, an oath. They thrust us off;"
18375,RALEIGH,And then we swung our nose against their bows
18376,RALEIGH,And pulled them round with every well-meant stroke.
18377,RALEIGH,"A full half minute, ere they won quite free,"
18378,RALEIGH,Cursing us for a pair of drunken fools.
18379,RALEIGH,
18380,RALEIGH,We drifted down behind them.
18381,RALEIGH,
18382,RALEIGH,"""There's no doubt,"""
18383,RALEIGH,"Said Ben, ""the headsman waits behind all this"
18384,RALEIGH,For Raleigh. This is a play to cheat the soul
18385,RALEIGH,"Of England, teach the people to applaud"
18386,RALEIGH,"The red fifth act."""
18387,RALEIGH,Without another word we drifted down
18388,RALEIGH,"For centuries it seemed, until we came"
18389,RALEIGH,To Greenwich.
18390,RALEIGH,Then up the long white burnished reach there crept
18391,RALEIGH,Like little sooty clouds the two black boats
18392,RALEIGH,To meet us.
18393,RALEIGH,
18394,RALEIGH,"""He is in the trap,"" said Ben,"
18395,RALEIGH,"""And does not know it yet. See, where he sits"
18396,RALEIGH,"By Stukeley as by a friend."""
18397,RALEIGH,
18398,RALEIGH,"Long after this,"
18399,RALEIGH,"We heard how Raleigh, simply as a child,"
18400,RALEIGH,"Seeing the tide would never serve him now,"
18401,RALEIGH,"And they must turn, had taken from his neck"
18402,RALEIGH,"Some trinkets that he wore. ""Keep them,"" he said"
18403,RALEIGH,"To Stukeley, ""in remembrance of this night."""
18404,RALEIGH,
18405,RALEIGH,He had no doubts of Stukeley when he saw
18406,RALEIGH,The wherry close beside them. He but wrapped
18407,RALEIGH,His cloak a little closer round his face.
18408,RALEIGH,Our boat rocked in their wash when Stukeley dropped
18409,RALEIGH,"The mask. We saw him give the sign, and heard"
18410,RALEIGH,"His high-pitched quavering voice--""IN THE KING'S NAME!"""
18411,RALEIGH,"Raleigh rose to his feet. ""I am under arrest?"""
18412,RALEIGH,"He said, like a dazed man."
18413,RALEIGH,
18414,RALEIGH,And Stukeley laughed.
18415,RALEIGH,"Then, as he bore himself to the grim end,"
18416,RALEIGH,"All doubt being over, the old sea-king stood"
18417,RALEIGH,"Among those glittering points, a king indeed."
18418,RALEIGH,"The black boats rocked. We heard his level voice,"
18419,RALEIGH,"""_Sir Lewis, these actions never will turn out"
18420,RALEIGH,"To your good credit._"" Across the moonlit Thames"
18421,RALEIGH,"It rang contemptuously, cold as cold steel,"
18422,RALEIGH,And passionless as the judgment that ends all.
18423,RALEIGH,

18425,RALEIGH,
18426,RALEIGH,"Some three months later, Raleigh's widow came"
18427,RALEIGH,To lodge a se'nnight at the Mermaid Inn.
18428,RALEIGH,"His house in Bread Street was no more her own,"
18429,RALEIGH,"But in the hands of Stukeley, who had reaped"
18430,RALEIGH,A pretty harvest ...
18431,RALEIGH,"She kept close to her room, and that same night,"
18432,RALEIGH,"Being ill and with some fever, sent her maid"
18433,RALEIGH,"To fetch the apothecary from Friday Street,"
18434,RALEIGH,"Old ""Galen"" as the Mermaid christened him."
18435,RALEIGH,"At that same moment, as the maid went out,"
18436,RALEIGH,Stukeley came in. He met her at the door;
18437,RALEIGH,"And, chucking her under the chin, gave her a letter."
18438,RALEIGH,"""Take this up to your mistress. It concerns"
18439,RALEIGH,"Her property,"" he said. ""Say that I wait,"
18440,RALEIGH,"And would be glad to speak with her."""
18441,RALEIGH,The wench
18442,RALEIGH,"Looked pertly in his face, and tripped upstairs."
18443,RALEIGH,I scarce could trust my hands.
18444,RALEIGH,"""Sir Lewis,"" I said,"
18445,RALEIGH,"""This is no time to trouble her. She is ill."""
18446,RALEIGH,"""Let her decide,"" he answered, with a sneer."
18447,RALEIGH,Before I found another word to say
18448,RALEIGH,The maid tripped down again. I scarce believed
18449,RALEIGH,"My senses, when she beckoned him up the stair."
18450,RALEIGH,"Shaking from head to foot, I blocked the way."
18451,RALEIGH,"""Property!"" Could the crux of mine and thine"
18452,RALEIGH,Bring widow and murderer into one small room?
18453,RALEIGH,"""Sir Lewis,"" I said, ""she is ill. It is not right!"
18454,RALEIGH,"She never would consent."""
18455,RALEIGH,"He sneered again,"
18456,RALEIGH,"""You are her doctor? Out of the way, old fool!"
18457,RALEIGH,"She has decided!"""
18458,RALEIGH,"""Go,"" I said to the maid,"
18459,RALEIGH,"""Fetch the apothecary. Let it rest"
18460,RALEIGH,"With him!"""
18461,RALEIGH,"She tossed her head. Her quick eyes glanced,"
18462,RALEIGH,"Showing the white, like the eyes of a vicious mare."
18463,RALEIGH,"She laughed at Stukeley, loitered, then obeyed."
18464,RALEIGH,
18465,RALEIGH,"And so we waited, till the wench returned,"
18466,RALEIGH,"With Galen at her heels. His wholesome face,"
18467,RALEIGH,"Russet and wrinkled like an apple, peered"
18468,RALEIGH,"Shrewdly at Stukeley, twinkled once at me,"
18469,RALEIGH,"And passed in silence, leaving a whiff of herbs"
18470,RALEIGH,Behind him on the stair.
18471,RALEIGH,"Five minutes later,"
18472,RALEIGH,"To my amazement, that same wholesome face"
18473,RALEIGH,"Leaned from the lighted door above, and called"
18474,RALEIGH,"""Sir Lewis Stukeley!"""
18475,RALEIGH,Sir Judas hastened up.
18476,RALEIGH,The apothecary followed him within.
18477,RALEIGH,The door shut. I was left there in the dark
18478,RALEIGH,Bewildered; for my heart was hot with thoughts
18479,RALEIGH,"Of those last months. Our Summer's Nightingale,"
18480,RALEIGH,"Our Ocean-Shepherd from the Main-deep Sea,"
18481,RALEIGH,"The Founder of our Mermaid Fellowship,"
18482,RALEIGH,Was this his guerdon--at the Mermaid Inn?
18483,RALEIGH,Was this that maid-of-honour whose romance
18484,RALEIGH,"With Raleigh, once, had been a kingdom's talk?"
18485,RALEIGH,Could Bess Throckmorton slight his memory thus?
18486,RALEIGH,"""It is not right,"" I said, ""it is not right."
18487,RALEIGH,"She wrongs him deeply."""
18488,RALEIGH,I leaned against the porch
18489,RALEIGH,Staring into the night. A ghostly ray
18490,RALEIGH,"Above me, from her window, bridged the street,"
18491,RALEIGH,And rested on the goldsmith's painted sign
18492,RALEIGH,Opposite.
18493,RALEIGH,I could hear the muffled voice
18494,RALEIGH,"Of Stukeley overhead, persuasive, bland;"
18495,RALEIGH,"And then, her own, cooing, soft as a dove"
18496,RALEIGH,"Calling her mate from Eden cedar-boughs,"
18497,RALEIGH,Flowed on and on; and then--all my flesh crept
18498,RALEIGH,"At something worse than either, a long space"
18499,RALEIGH,"Of silence that stretched threatening and cold,"
18500,RALEIGH,Cold as a dagger-point pricking the skin
18501,RALEIGH,Over my heart.
18502,RALEIGH,"Then came a stifled cry,"
18503,RALEIGH,"A crashing door, a footstep on the stair"
18504,RALEIGH,"Blundering like a drunkard's, heavily down;"
18505,RALEIGH,And with his gasping face one tragic mask
18506,RALEIGH,"Of horror,--may God help me to forget"
18507,RALEIGH,Some day the frozen awful eyes of one
18508,RALEIGH,"Who, fearing neither hell nor heaven, has met"
18509,RALEIGH,"That ultimate weapon of the gods, the face"
18510,RALEIGH,And serpent-tresses that turn flesh to stone--
18511,RALEIGH,"Stukeley stumbled, groping his way out,"
18512,RALEIGH,"Blindly, past me, into the sheltering night."
18513,RALEIGH,
18514,RALEIGH,*   *   *   *
18515,RALEIGH,
18516,RALEIGH,It was the last night of another year
18517,RALEIGH,Before I understood what punishment
18518,RALEIGH,"Had overtaken Stukeley. Ben, and Brome--"
18519,RALEIGH,"Ben's ancient servant, but turned poet now--"
18520,RALEIGH,Sat by the fire with the old apothecary
18521,RALEIGH,To see the New Year in.
18522,RALEIGH,The starry night
18523,RALEIGH,Had drawn me to the door. Could it be true
18524,RALEIGH,That our poor earth no longer was the hub
18525,RALEIGH,Of those white wheeling orbs? I scarce believed
18526,RALEIGH,The strange new dreams; but I had seen the veils
18527,RALEIGH,"Rent from vast oceans and huge continents,"
18528,RALEIGH,"Till what was once our comfortable fire,"
18529,RALEIGH,"Our cosy tavern, and our earthly home"
18530,RALEIGH,"With heaven beyond the next turn in the road,"
18531,RALEIGH,All the resplendent fabric of our world
18532,RALEIGH,"Shrank to a glow-worm, lighting up one leaf"
18533,RALEIGH,"In one small forest, in one little land,"
18534,RALEIGH,Among those wild infinitudes of God.
18535,RALEIGH,"A tattered wastrel wandered down the street,"
18536,RALEIGH,"Clad in a seaman's jersey, staring hard"
18537,RALEIGH,"At every sign. Beneath our own, the light"
18538,RALEIGH,Fell on his red carbuncled face. I knew him--
18539,RALEIGH,"The bo'sun, Hart."
18540,RALEIGH,He pointed to our sign
18541,RALEIGH,"And leered at me. ""That's her,"" he said, ""no doubt,"
18542,RALEIGH,The sea-witch with the shiny mackerel tail
18543,RALEIGH,Swishing in wine. That's what Sir Lewis meant.
18544,RALEIGH,"He called it blood. Blood is his craze, you see."
18545,RALEIGH,"This is the Mermaid Tavern, sir, no doubt?"""
18546,RALEIGH,"I nodded. ""Ah, I thought as much,"" he said."
18547,RALEIGH,"""Well--happen this is worth a cup of ale."""
18548,RALEIGH,He thrust his hand under his jersey and lugged
18549,RALEIGH,A greasy letter out. It was inscribed
18550,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.
18551,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,
18552,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"I led him in. ""I knew it, sir,"" he said,"
18553,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"While Galen broke the seal. ""Soon as I saw"
18554,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,That sweet young naked wench curling her tail
18555,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,In those red waves.--The old man called it blood.
18556,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Blood is his craze, you see.--But you can tell"
18557,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"'Tis wine, sir, by the foam. Malmsey, no doubt."
18558,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,And that sweet wench to make you smack your lips
18559,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Like oysters, with her slippery tail and all!"
18560,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Why, sir, no doubt, this was the Mermaid Inn."""
18561,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,
18562,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"""But this,"" said Galen, lifting his grave face"
18563,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"To Ben, ""this letter is from all that's left"
18564,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Of Stukeley. The good host, there, thinks I wronged"
18565,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Your Ocean-shepherd's memory. From this letter,"
18566,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,I think I helped to avenge him. Do not wrong
18567,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"His widow, even in thought. She loved him dearly."
18568,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,You know she keeps his poor grey severed head
18569,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Embalmed; and so will keep it till she dies;
18570,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Weeps over it alone. I have heard such things
18571,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,In wild Italian tales. But _this_ was true.
18572,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Had I refused to let her speak with Stukeley
18573,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,I feared she would go mad. This letter proves
18574,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"That I--and she perhaps--were instruments,"
18575,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Of some more terrible chirurgery
18576,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Than either knew."""
18577,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,
18578,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"""Ah, when I saw your sign,"""
18579,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"The bo'sun interjected, ""I'd no doubt"
18580,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"That letter was well worth a cup of ale."""
18581,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,
18582,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"""Go--paint your bows with hell-fire somewhere else,"
18583,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Not at this inn,"" said Ben, tossing the rogue"
18584,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"A good French crown. ""Pickle yourself in hell."""
18585,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"And Hart lurched out into the night again,"
18586,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Muttering ""Thank you, sirs. 'Twas worth all that."
18587,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"No doubt at all."""
18588,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,
18589,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"""There are some men,"" said Galen,"
18590,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Spreading the letter out on his plump knees,"
18591,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"""Will heap up wrong on wrong; and, at the last,"
18592,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Wonder because the world will not forget
18593,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Just when it suits them, cancel all they owe,"
18594,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"And, like a mother, hold its arms out wide"
18595,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"At their first cry. And, sirs, I do believe"
18596,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"That Stukeley, on that night, had some such wish"
18597,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,To reconcile himself. What else had passed
18598,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Between the widow and himself I know not;
18599,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,But she had lured him on until he thought
18600,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"That words and smiles, perhaps a tear or two,"
18601,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Might make the widow take the murderer's hand
18602,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"In friendship, since it might advantage both."
18603,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Indeed, he came prepared for even more."
18604,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Villains are always fools. A wicked act,"
18605,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"What is it but a false move in the game,"
18606,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"A blind man's blunder, a deaf man's reply,"
18607,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,The wrong drug taken in the dead of night?
18608,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,I always pity villains.
18609,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,I mistook
18610,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,The avenger for the victim. There she lay
18611,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Panting, that night, her eyes like summer stars"
18612,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Her pale gold hair upon the pillows tossed
18613,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Dishevelled, while the fever in her face"
18614,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Brought back the lost wild roses of her youth
18615,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,For half an hour. Against a breast as pure
18616,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"And smooth as any maid's, her soft arms pressed"
18617,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,A bundle wrapped in a white embroidered cloth.
18618,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,She crooned over it as a mother croons
18619,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Over her suckling child. I stood beside her.
18620,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"--That was her wish, and mine, while Stukeley stayed.--"
18621,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"And, over against me, on the other side,"
18622,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Stood Stukeley, gnawing his nether lip to find"
18623,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"She could not, or she would not, speak one word"
18624,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,In answer to his letter.
18625,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,
18626,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"'Lady Raleigh,"
18627,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"You wrong me, and you wrong yourself,' he cried,"
18628,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,'To play like a green girl when great affairs

18631,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,
18632,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"'But I am all alone,' she said,"

18637,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Then she lured him on,"
18638,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Played on his brain as a musician plays

18640,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"'Forgive me, dear Sir Lewis,"
18641,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,If I am grown too gay for widowhood.

18643,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,On all these matters. I know the world was right;
18644,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"And Spain was right, Sir Lewis. Yes, and you,"
18645,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"You too, were right; and my poor husband wrong."
18646,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,You see I knew his mind so very well.
18647,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"I knew his every gesture, every smile."
18648,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,I lived with him. I think I died with him.
18649,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"It is a strange thing, marriage. For my soul"

18651,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Beside him, slept in his grey prison-cell"
18652,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,On that last dreadful dawn. I heard the throng
18653,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Murmuring round the scaffold far away;
18654,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"And, with the smell of sawdust in my nostrils,"
18655,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"I woke, bewildered as himself, to see"
18656,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,That tall black-cassocked figure by his bed.
18657,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,I heard the words that made him understand:
18658,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,_The Body of our Lord--take and eat this!_
18659,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,I rolled the small sour flakes beneath my tongue
18660,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"With him. I caught, with him, the gleam of tears,"
18661,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Far off, on some strange face of sickly dread."
18662,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"_The Blood_--and the cold cup was in my hand,"
18663,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Cold as an axe-heft washed with waterish red.
18664,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,I heard his last poor cry to wife and child.--
18665,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Could any that heard forget it?--_My true God,"
18666,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Hold you both in His arms, both in His arms._"
18667,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"And then--that last poor wish, a thing to raise"
18668,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,A smile in some. I have smiled at it myself

18676,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Melted his prison walls to a summer haze,"
18677,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Through which I think he saw the little port
18678,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Of Budleigh Salterton, like a sea-bird's nest"
18679,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Among the Devon cliffs--the tarry quay
18680,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Whence in his boyhood he had flung a line
18681,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,For bass or whiting-pollock. I remembered
18682,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"(Had he not told me, on some summer night,"
18683,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"His arm about my neck, kissing my hair)"

18685,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Fish, and for what? Not all for what he caught"
18686,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"And handled; but for rainbow-coloured things,"
18687,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"The water-drops that jewelled his thin line,"
18688,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Flotsam and jetsam of the sunset-clouds;
18689,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"While the green water, gurgling through the piles,"
18690,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Heaving and sinking, helped him to believe"
18691,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,The fast-bound quay a galleon plunging out
18692,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Superbly for Cathay. There would he sit

18700,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,The trumpets and the neighings and the drums.
18701,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,I watched the beacons on a hundred hills.
18702,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"I drank that wine of battle from _his_ cup,"
18703,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"And gloried in it, lying against his heart."
18704,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,I sailed with him and saw the unknown worlds!
18705,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,The slender ivory towers of old Cathay
18706,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Rose for us over lilac-coloured seas
18707,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,That crumbled a sky-blue foam on long shores
18708,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Of shining sand, shores of so clear a glass"
18709,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,They drew the sunset-clouds into their bosom
18710,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,And hung that City of Vision in mid-air
18711,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Girdling it round, as with a moat of sky,"
18712,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Hopelessly beautiful. O, yet I heard,"
18713,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Heard from his blazoned poops the trumpeters
18714,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Blowing proud calls, while overhead the flag"
18715,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Of England floated from white towers of sail--
18716,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"And yet, and yet, I knew that he was wrong,"
18717,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"And soon he knew it, too."
18718,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,
18719,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,I saw the cloud
18720,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Of doubt assail him, in the Bloody Tower,"
18721,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"When, being withheld from sailing the high seas"
18722,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"For sixteen years, he spread a prouder sail,"
18723,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Took up his pen, and, walled about with stone,"
18724,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Began to write--his _History of the World_.
18725,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,And emperors came like Lazarus from the grave
18726,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,To wear his purple. And the night disgorged
18727,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Its empires, till, O, like the swirl of dust"
18728,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Around their marching legions, that dim cloud"
18729,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Of doubt closed round him. Was there any man
18730,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,So sure of heart and brain as to record
18731,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,The simple truth of things himself had seen?
18732,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Then who could plumb that night? The work broke off!
18733,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"He knew that he was wrong. I knew it, too!"
18734,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Once more that stately structure of his dreams
18735,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Melted like mist. His eagles perished like clouds.
18736,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Death wound a thin horn through the centuries.
18737,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,The grave resumed his forlorn emperors.
18738,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,His empires crumbled back to a little ash
18739,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Knocked from his pipe.--
18740,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,He dropped his pen in homage to the truth.
18741,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"The truth? _O, eloquent, just and mighty Death!_"
18742,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,
18743,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Then, when he forged, out of one golden thought,"
18744,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,A key to open his prison; when the King
18745,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Released him for a tale of faërie gold
18746,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Under the tropic palms; when those grey walls
18747,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Melted before his passion; do you think
18748,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,The gold that lured the King was quite the same
18749,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,As that which Raleigh saw? You know the song:
18750,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,
18751,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"""Say to the King,"" quoth Raleigh,"
18752,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"""I have a tale to tell him;"

18754,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Veils to lift from the sky,"
18755,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Seas to sail for England,"
18756,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"And a little dream to sell him,"
18757,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Gold, the gold of a vision"
18758,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"That angels cannot buy."""
18759,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,
18760,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Ah, no! For all the beauty and the pride,"
18761,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Raleigh was wrong; but not so wrong, I think,"
18762,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,As those for whom his kingdoms oversea
18763,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Meant only glittering dust. The fight he waged
18764,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Was not with them. They never worsted him.
18765,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,
18766,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,It was _The Destiny_ that brought him home
18767,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Without the Spanish gold.--O, he was wrong,"
18768,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"But such a wrong, in Gloriana's day,"
18769,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Was more than right, was immortality."
18770,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,He had just half an hour to put all this
18771,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Into his pipe and smoke it,--"
18772,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,
18773,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"The red fire,"
18774,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,The red heroic fire that filled his veins
18775,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,When the proud flag of England floated out
18776,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Its challenge to the world--all gone to ash?
18777,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,What! Was the great red wine that Drake had quaffed
18778,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Vinegar? He must fawn, haul down his flag,"
18779,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"And count all nations nobler than his own,"
18780,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Tear out the lions from the painted shields
18781,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"That hung his poop, for fear that he offend"
18782,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,The pride of Spain? Treason to sack the ships
18783,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Of Spain? The wounds of slaughtered Englishmen
18784,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Cried out--_there is no law beyond the line!_
18785,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Treason to sweep the seas with Francis Drake?
18786,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Treason to fight for England?
18787,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"If it were so,"
18788,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,The times had changed and quickly. He had been
18789,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,A schoolboy in the morning of the world
18790,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Playing with wooden swords and winning crowns
18791,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Of tinsel; but his comrades had outgrown
18792,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Their morning-game, and gathered round to mock"
18793,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,His battles in the sunset. Yet he knew
18794,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,That all his life had passed in that brief day;
18795,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"And he was old, too old to understand"
18796,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"The smile upon the face of Buckingham,"
18797,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"The smile on Cobham's face, at that great word"
18798,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,_England_!
18799,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,He knew the solid earth was changed
18800,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,To something less than dust among the stars--
18801,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"And, O, be sure he knew that he was wrong,"
18802,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"That gleams would come,"
18803,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Gleams of a happier world for younger men,"
18804,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"That Commonwealth, far off. This was a time"
18805,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Of sadder things, destruction of the old"
18806,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Before the new was born. At least he knew
18807,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,It was his own way that had brought the world
18808,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Thus far, England thus far! How could he change,"
18809,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Who had loved England as a man might love
18810,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"His mistress, change from year to fickle year?"
18811,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"For the new years would change, even as the old."
18812,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"No--he was wedded to that old first love,"
18813,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Crude flesh and blood, and coarse as meat and drink,"
18814,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"The woman--England; no fine angel-isle,"
18815,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Ruled by that male Salome--Buckingham!
18816,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Better the axe than to live on and wage
18817,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,These new and silent and more deadly wars
18818,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,That play at friendship with our enemies.
18819,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Such times are evil. Not of their own desire
18820,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"They lead to good, blind agents of that Hand"
18821,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Which now had hewed him down, down to his knees,"
18822,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,But in a prouder battle than men knew.
18823,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,
18824,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"His pipe was out, the guard was at the door."
18825,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Raleigh was not a god. But, when he climbed"
18826,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"The scaffold, I believe he looked a man."
18827,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"And when the axe fell, I believe that God"
18828,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Set on his shoulders that immortal head
18829,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Which he desired on earth.
18830,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,
18831,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"O, he was wrong!"
18832,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"But when that axe fell, not one shout was raised."
18833,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,That mighty throng around that crimson block
18834,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Stood silent--like the hushed black cloud that holds
18835,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,The thunder. You might hear the headsman's breath.
18836,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Stillness like that is dangerous, being charged,"
18837,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Sometimes, with thought, Sir Lewis! England sleeps!"
18838,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"What if, one day, the Stewart should be called"
18839,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,To know that England wakes? What if a shout
18840,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Should thunder-strike Whitehall, and the dogs lift"
18841,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Their heads along the fringes of the crowd
18842,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"To catch a certain savour that I know,"
18843,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,The smell of blood and sawdust?--
18844,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,
18845,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Ah, Sir Lewis,"
18846,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,'Tis hard to find one little seed of right
18847,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Among so many wrongs. Raleigh was wrong,"
18848,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,And yet--it was because he loved his country
18849,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"Next to himself, Sir Lewis, by your leave,"
18850,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,His country butchered him. You did not know
18851,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,That I was only third in his affections?
18852,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,The night I told him--we were parting then--
18853,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"I had begged the last disposal of his body,"

18861,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,'Indeed I thought him kinder.'
18862,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,
18863,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"'Kinder,' she said,"
18864,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Laughing bitterly.
18865,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,
18866,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Stukeley looked at her.
18867,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"She whispered something, and his lewd old eyes"
18868,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Fastened upon her own. He knelt by her.
18869,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"'Perhaps,' he said, 'your woman's wit has found"
18870,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,A better way to solve this bitter business.'
18871,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,Her head moved on the pillow with little tossings.
18872,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,He touched her hand. It leapt quickly away.
18873,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"She hugged that strange white bundle to her breast,"
18874,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"And writhed back, smiling at him, across the bed."
18875,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,
18876,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"'Ah, Bess,' he whispered huskily, pressing his lips"
18877,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"To that warm hollow where her head had lain,"
18878,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,"'There is one way to close the long dispute,"

18881,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,We have some years to live; and why alone?'
18882,THE APOTHECARY AT THE MERMAID TAVERN.,'Alone?' she sighed. 'My husband thought of that.

19449,THE BRINGERS OF GOOD NEWS,
19450,THE BRINGERS OF GOOD NEWS,One shout of triumph and of faith;
19451,THE BRINGERS OF GOOD NEWS,And then--our shattering cannon roared!
19452,THE BRINGERS OF GOOD NEWS,"But, over the reeking ranks of death,"
19453,THE BRINGERS OF GOOD NEWS,The song rose like a single sword.
19454,THE BRINGERS OF GOOD NEWS,
19455,THE BRINGERS OF GOOD NEWS,_We bring good news!_ Red flared the guns!
19456,THE BRINGERS OF GOOD NEWS,_We bring good news!_ The sabres flashed!
19457,THE BRINGERS OF GOOD NEWS,And the dark age with its own sons
19458,THE BRINGERS OF GOOD NEWS,In blind and furious battle clashed.
19459,THE BRINGERS OF GOOD NEWS,
19460,THE BRINGERS OF GOOD NEWS,"A swift, a terrible bugle pealed."
19461,THE BRINGERS OF GOOD NEWS,The sulphurous clouds were rolled away.
19462,THE BRINGERS OF GOOD NEWS,"Embraced, embraced, on that red field,"
19463,THE BRINGERS OF GOOD NEWS,The wounded and the dying lay.
19464,THE BRINGERS OF GOOD NEWS,
