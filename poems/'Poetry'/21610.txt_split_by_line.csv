72,CHAPTER I,
73,CHAPTER I,The Creation of the Heavens
74,CHAPTER I,
75,CHAPTER I,
76,CHAPTER I,"Jehovah has no beginning. He himself created time, and taught its"
77,CHAPTER I,"principles to the living things he also created, giving to them"
78,CHAPTER I,"comprehension, by which we ascribe, unto the infiniteness of Jehovah a"
79,CHAPTER I,time and a beginning.
80,CHAPTER I,
81,CHAPTER I,Before that there were not any man or angels or living creatures of any
82,CHAPTER I,"form created. When there were no worlds yet formed, nature stood in"
83,CHAPTER I,"three kingdoms. They were Light, Water, and Darkness."
84,CHAPTER I,
85,CHAPTER I,"Then the kingdom of the light strove against the kingdom of darkness,"
86,CHAPTER I,and the darkness contended with the light. The two elements came
87,CHAPTER I,"together, each of them a separate unit, contending against the other."
88,CHAPTER I,And in their controversy the virtue of the power of each of them became
89,CHAPTER I,formed and concentrated into a living being. Their personalities are as
90,CHAPTER I,"those of men, but their substance is power. The virtue--the"
91,CHAPTER I,pre-motive--the ruling quorum--the master of all power: The being of
92,CHAPTER I,light was much greater than the being of darkness and ruled over him;
93,CHAPTER I,therefore was his name Jehovah. The being of darkness hated him with
94,CHAPTER I,"great envy, thereby was his name Satan. But they were both lonesome;"
95,CHAPTER I,being alone: Even as light and darkness is obstinate to each other.
96,CHAPTER I,
97,CHAPTER I,"Then Jehovah saw that he was the master of nature, all power being"
98,CHAPTER I,controlled by his hands. He looked upon the kingdom of the Waters and
99,CHAPTER I,saw that their alluvian substance could be divided and congealed into
100,CHAPTER I,"many kingdoms of minerals, and he decided to create a world. He sent a"
101,CHAPTER I,current of electricity in its first nature through the face of the
102,CHAPTER I,"waters and said, ""let the minerals be gathered together, each one in its"
103,CHAPTER I,place in perfect order for the earth; and let the dry land appear above
104,CHAPTER I,"the face of the waters."" And the natural electricity went forth and"
105,CHAPTER I,"returned to and fro, and it was done."
106,CHAPTER I,
107,CHAPTER I,"And Jehovah came and walked upon the world which he had created, and he"
108,CHAPTER I,called it Heaven. For it was a place upon which he would cause to rest
109,CHAPTER I,the substance of life--out of which he had come. And he called to the
110,CHAPTER I,kingdom of light and saw that it was an immensity of life. Dividing it
111,CHAPTER I,he formed and created minor beings after his own image and in his own
112,CHAPTER I,"form. And he called them souls. But they were naked, having no substance"
113,CHAPTER I,for bodies like him. All the face of the heaven was filled with them as
114,CHAPTER I,they glittered before their creator in hosts. Some of them were great
115,CHAPTER I,"and some of them were small; all being different, each one shining"
116,CHAPTER I,according to the power of its own light.
117,CHAPTER I,
118,CHAPTER I,Then Jehovah created souls for other living things of all manner of
119,CHAPTER I,"shapes and forms, great and small--unto the infinite small things until"
120,CHAPTER I,the substance of life was contained.
121,CHAPTER I,
122,CHAPTER I,"Jehovah set for his created things an order and a procession of life,"
123,CHAPTER I,creating for them bodies. And they arose up and began to fill all the
124,CHAPTER I,face of heaven with songs and music. And thus the Heaven and the hosts
125,CHAPTER I,of it were finished.
126,CHAPTER I,
127,CHAPTER I,"And Satan enveighed Jehovah and the things which he had made, for he"
128,CHAPTER I,knew that there was no power of creating forces in the virtue of
129,CHAPTER I,"darkness, and that he himself could not create or make any living thing"
130,CHAPTER I,to stand before him in life. Therefore he hated life and sought with all
131,CHAPTER I,his power to destroy the created things of Jehovah. Satan's power went
132,CHAPTER I,out as a shadower of darkness towards them. It was the virtue of his own
133,CHAPTER I,evil self--his spirit of darkness--which attempted to come upon the
134,CHAPTER I,"people and the beasts which Jehovah had made, to destroy them."
135,CHAPTER I,
136,CHAPTER I,But a light went forth from Jehovah as a refuge and a defense. It was
137,CHAPTER I,the virtue of his own righteous self--his spirit of perfection--the
138,CHAPTER I,embodiment of his almighty mind. The righteousness of his power went
139,CHAPTER I,"forth and filled all his creation, and shielded and protected all the"
140,CHAPTER I,living things which he had made from the darkness and evil of Satan.
141,CHAPTER I,
142,CHAPTER I,"The creation teemed with the glory of Jehovah, an unmentionable space,"
143,CHAPTER I,"for there was no time there. Neither were there the aged or dying, for"
144,CHAPTER I,Satan had not as yet cursed any thing that Jehovah had made. But justice
145,CHAPTER I,"being the authority of Jehovah, he must be just with Satan also. He"
146,CHAPTER I,could not prevent Satan from coming upon the earth and walking to and
147,CHAPTER I,"fro through his creation. Jehovah could be jealous, but not selfish and"
148,CHAPTER I,unjust. If Satan could persuade any of his creatures to forsake him and
149,CHAPTER I,"to receive within them the power of his own Satanic spirit, justice said"
150,CHAPTER I,that they were his and Jehovah should bear the loss.
151,CHAPTER I,
152,CHAPTER I,"But Satan could not withstand the light and glory of Jehovah, for"
153,CHAPTER I,Jehovah's brilliancy filled the heaven. He dwelt upon a throne in a
154,CHAPTER I,temple of power. The throne and temple were living power. Being gathered
155,CHAPTER I,"together a natural substance which is power, and the pre-motive glory of"
156,CHAPTER I,all beauty giving life to the living by its power of that which he
157,CHAPTER I,"chose to array his dwelling place with. The virtue of the colors, the"
158,CHAPTER I,"red and green, azure, onyx, diamond, bedellium, saraf, amber, and all"
159,CHAPTER I,"manner of adornments of beauty, were faded of their virgin colors and"
160,CHAPTER I,"their sereness of glory, were brought forth in the construction of his"
161,CHAPTER I,temple and throne. So that no being should be able to surpass Jehovah in
162,CHAPTER I,glory hence.
163,CHAPTER I,
164,CHAPTER I,And the temple and the throne in the temple is one living thing of
165,CHAPTER I,"eternal life, borne by other living things. Where Jehovah wills to go,"
166,CHAPTER I,"the temple also can go. Eternal substance of power like streams of fire,"
167,CHAPTER I,but more white like the light of diamond issuing toward every point of
168,CHAPTER I,the creation as it goes forth in its glory; and there is nothing unseen
169,CHAPTER I,or hid from its light.
170,CHAPTER I,
171,CHAPTER I,"In the language and knowledge of man, infinite was the time that Satan"
172,CHAPTER I,sought before he was able to defile any of the sons and daughters of
173,CHAPTER I,Jehovah. But out somewhere in the eternity sin began to steal into the
174,CHAPTER I,souls of the sons of the mighty. And they began to hate Jehovah and to
175,CHAPTER I,envy his glory in a great dispensation. Satan diminishing them after his
176,CHAPTER I,own power until one-third of all the hosts of heaven were defiled with
177,CHAPTER I,"sin. And they had fallen from their power and from their former glory,"
178,CHAPTER I,and had strayed away from their father's house; the brightness of their
179,CHAPTER I,souls glittering not. Satan had captivated them over into his great
180,CHAPTER I,"night of despair--and they knew it not, for Satan had always appeared to"
181,CHAPTER I,"them arrayed in glory as if Jehovah, and they supposed that he was able"
182,CHAPTER I,"to continually give them light. But they were cast away from Jehovah,"
183,CHAPTER I,"and there was darkness and violence and despair, for the light of Satan"
184,CHAPTER I,was as the shadows of a great night. There was no sun and moon and stars
185,CHAPTER I,"to give them artificial light, for Jehovah is the only light of the"
186,CHAPTER I,"living soul, and his glory is the light of that world. The heaven was"
187,CHAPTER I,filled with violence and his name was blasphemed with many inventions.
188,CHAPTER I,But they repented not from Satan unto Jehovah. Then there was war upon
189,CHAPTER I,"the face of all the heaven: Michael and Mikrell and Gabriel, and the"
190,CHAPTER I,millions of the mighty ones of the righteous came before Jehovah in a
191,CHAPTER I,council of war. And it was decreed that all the hosts of the wicked
192,CHAPTER I,should be slain and cast out of the heaven. And that the face of the
193,CHAPTER I,heaven should be cleansed.
194,CHAPTER I,
195,CHAPTER I,Then one came and stood before Jehovah--one whom he loved greater than
196,CHAPTER I,the love which he had for many of his created beings. He being the
197,CHAPTER I,"excellency of his beginning, his son by love. And he said ""Father, if"
198,CHAPTER I,all these be slain and cast down they remain dead forever. They are
199,CHAPTER I,Satan's and he rejoices against thee that he shall ever have them. I go
200,CHAPTER I,in their midst and redeem them from Satan that they shall live again. I
201,CHAPTER I,shall purchase them from Satan with my own life. I die that they might
202,CHAPTER I,"live again. Father, make for them another world that they might live"
203,CHAPTER I,again and have a chance to repent from Satan unto thee. That they in
204,CHAPTER I,"their great hosts remain not dead--forever dead."" And Jehovah said,"
205,CHAPTER I,"""Son, if we make man again in our own image after our glory; again will"
206,CHAPTER I,"man sin, and Satan will have the mastery over him, and there would be"
207,CHAPTER I,"none to inhabit the new world which I create."" Then the son said,"
208,CHAPTER I,"""Father, it shall be righteous that you make man again, for I shall go"
209,CHAPTER I,with him until a day in which I shall meet thee out upon that world and
210,CHAPTER I,"there again I will pay the price of man's sins, and redeem him from the"
211,CHAPTER I,"power of Satan, that not all of those be lost--forever lost."""
212,CHAPTER I,
213,CHAPTER I,The decree of Jehovah was given that they should live again. Then
214,CHAPTER I,"Michael, the captain of Jehovah's hosts, went forth and fought against"
215,CHAPTER I,"the Dragon; and the Dragon and his armies fought, but prevailed not;"
216,CHAPTER I,neither was there any more room found in heaven for Satan and his host.
217,CHAPTER I,And the great Dragon--Satan--was cast out of heaven and all his angels
218,CHAPTER I,with him.
219,CHAPTER I,
220,CHAPTER I,And his right to dwell upon the face of heaven was forfeited when his
221,CHAPTER I,servants had slain the son of Jehovah. Who also redeemed the souls of
222,CHAPTER I,the dead from Satan's power when they had shed the blood of the captain
223,CHAPTER I,of salvation. And the heaven was cleansed from sin. Neither could Satan
224,CHAPTER I,or any of his servants return. All those who had sinned were forever
225,CHAPTER I,cast down. And the decree was set that they should not ascend again into
226,CHAPTER I,heaven in the infinite eternity. But those of Jehovah's servants who
227,CHAPTER I,"loved not their lives in the days of battle and were slain in the war,"
228,CHAPTER I,"if they chose to follow their lost brothers down into the new world,"
229,CHAPTER I,they from there might ascend again unto their father's house.
230,CHAPTER I,
231,CHAPTER I,"And the waters stood beneath the heavens, and there was no form or void"
232,CHAPTER I,in their substance. And the darkness prevailed unchanging. Then the
233,CHAPTER I,spirit of Jehovah moved upon the face of the waters beholding all
234,CHAPTER I,"things. And Jehovah said let the light appear upon the face of the deep,"
235,CHAPTER I,and let the darkness be gathered together in one place beneath the
236,CHAPTER I,"heaven, and half of its place be given for the light, and it was so. And"
237,CHAPTER I,Jehovah beheld the light that it was glorious. And he said let the
238,CHAPTER I,firmament of electricity divide the waters again beneath the heaven. And
239,CHAPTER I,let the substance of the upper part of the waters above the firmament be
240,CHAPTER I,gathered together and let the dry land appear.
241,CHAPTER I,
242,CHAPTER I,And let the waters whose substance have formed the earth be gathered
243,CHAPTER I,"together, and let the earth and the waters stand in perfectness in their"
244,CHAPTER I,orders. And let the firmament beneath the heaven of electricity remain
245,CHAPTER I,"unmovable, and let there be a door as a gateway from the heaven to the"
246,CHAPTER I,earth remain through the firmament.
247,CHAPTER I,
248,CHAPTER I,And thus on the first and second space of time which became days Jehovah
249,CHAPTER I,formed the earth and laid up veins of the minerals after their kinds in
250,CHAPTER I,"their places, in perfect order. The mountains rising up high above the"
251,CHAPTER I,"seas, giving to the seas their places of permanency in the lower places"
252,CHAPTER I,of the earth. In the third day Jehovah created the trees and
253,CHAPTER I,vegetation--all manner of trees to eradicate the face of the earth from
254,CHAPTER I,"its nakedness. He created the seeds in the earth, each seed after its"
255,CHAPTER I,"kind, so it could not change forever from the laws of nature. The fourth"
256,CHAPTER I,"day he created great lights, the sun and moon and stars, and set them in"
257,CHAPTER I,the firmament above the earth. In abodement of twelve houses. Made to
258,CHAPTER I,"rule the darkness and to alternate nature, giving life to the things"
259,CHAPTER I,which were to live in the parts of the earth where there was to be life.
260,CHAPTER I,
261,CHAPTER I,He made three hundred and sixty-four roads in the firmament above the
262,CHAPTER I,"earth, and placed the sun and the moon in them. The roads he made in an"
263,CHAPTER I,oblong shape and joined them together at one place in the East and in
264,CHAPTER I,"the West, that the sun should make his circuits over the earth and drive"
265,CHAPTER I,the darkness before him. And that the moon should make her circuits over
266,CHAPTER I,the earth to alternate and rule the darkness. And for her aid he made
267,CHAPTER I,the stars and set them in their places in the firmament and in the cross
268,CHAPTER I,roads which run across the pathways of the sun and moon; setting them in
269,CHAPTER I,order in twelve groups. And Jehovah wrote the stars and their pathways
270,CHAPTER I,upon the face of the firmament. They tell the story of his creation and
271,CHAPTER I,his love for the things he has created. As they move in their concourses
272,CHAPTER I,they are constantly spelling out the things which have never been
273,CHAPTER I,"changed, glittering above the mist of the earth in their work of"
274,CHAPTER I,perfection.
275,CHAPTER I,
276,CHAPTER I,And in the midst of the earth he set a magnet joining the heaven and the
277,CHAPTER I,earth together that the heaven and the earth should not move out of
278,CHAPTER I,their place forever. The magnet in its dimensions is perfectly round--a
279,CHAPTER I,tower of bluish mist shining bright like silver--where it stands in its
280,CHAPTER I,zone of perpetual darkness; where he made not a light to shine superior
281,CHAPTER I,to the darkness. And the magnet revolves around perpetually in its
282,CHAPTER I,"protraction, carrying the sun and moon and stars in their circuits over"
283,CHAPTER I,the face of the earth in their roads--in their courses according to
284,CHAPTER I,"their metallic natures--around in a circuit over the parts of the earth,"
285,CHAPTER I,where he designed for his things of life to live. Each monitor of the
286,CHAPTER I,firmament moving in its own place according to its power with the magnet
287,CHAPTER I,"of its own nature to do the things it was created to do, until its work"
288,CHAPTER I,"should be finished; then it falls from its place when its course is run,"
289,CHAPTER I,and is no more.
290,CHAPTER I,
291,CHAPTER I,And the sun sped on his course driving the darkness before him as it
292,CHAPTER I,closed up again behind him. And the morning and the evening were the
293,CHAPTER I,fourth day in the beginning of time. And the moon and the stars in their
294,CHAPTER I,courses over the earth drew up the metallic substance of the earth and
295,CHAPTER I,distilled and gave it to the sun; and he in his great speed cast them
296,CHAPTER I,"out upon the earth, again in minute atoms, and as they came in contact"
297,CHAPTER I,"with their own primordial atoms which lie upon the earth, and more"
298,CHAPTER I,"densely in the lower parts of the earth, they explode, causing"
299,CHAPTER I,atmospherical heat; each atom giving forth a yellow flame of light as it
300,CHAPTER I,"explodes, so minute that one light cannot be distinguished from another"
301,CHAPTER I,by the sense of man.
302,CHAPTER I,
303,CHAPTER I,"Thus on the fourth day began heat to gender upon the face of the earth,"
304,CHAPTER I,preventing the ice and snow from overcoming the life of vegetation in
305,CHAPTER I,the circuit of life which the creator had decreed upon the plains of
306,CHAPTER I,the world. And the sun went forth upon his circuit and came around again
307,CHAPTER I,"to the place from where he had started, encircling the magnet in the"
308,CHAPTER I,"center of the earth, thus beginning an endless day and an endless night,"
309,CHAPTER I,perpetually unchanging. His roads were decreed that from hence he should
310,CHAPTER I,"run from the east to the west upon one line, then from the west to the"
311,CHAPTER I,"east around on another line each day, drawing closer to the magnet on"
312,CHAPTER I,"one side and falling farther away on the other side, creating an endless"
313,CHAPTER I,"summer and an endless winter, and a springtime and a fall perpetually."
314,CHAPTER I,
315,CHAPTER I,The light of the sun as it came upon its nearest lines to the magnet
316,CHAPTER I,"where it stood in the center and lowest part of the earth, far enough"
317,CHAPTER I,distant that his rays could not penetrate into the region of the magnet
318,CHAPTER I,"and disturb its silence as it stands in its sea of ice and darkness,"
319,CHAPTER I,while the light of the sun from the outer roads from the magnet was
320,CHAPTER I,bounded about by darkness and unchanging ice. And towards the west
321,CHAPTER I,Jehovah had set up a great chain of mountains to hold back the light
322,CHAPTER I,"while the sun was upon his outer roads, that half of the nights might be"
323,CHAPTER I,long towards the region of the magnet. While to the east he had set up
324,CHAPTER I,no great mountains that the light of the sun on its outer roads from
325,CHAPTER I,"thence might reach across the plains towards the region of the magnet,"
326,CHAPTER I,that half of the nights might be light and giving glories of light for
327,CHAPTER I,half of the time of the years. While in the great white way of life the
328,CHAPTER I,continents and islands lay all teeming with glory.
329,CHAPTER I,
330,CHAPTER I,"The large continents having divides of high lands through them, from"
331,CHAPTER I,"which large rivers flow, some towards the outer seas and some of them"
332,CHAPTER I,flow down towards the lower parts of the earth towards the magnet. Then
333,CHAPTER I,the sons of Jehovah and the morning stars sang together and shouted for
334,CHAPTER I,joy when they saw the glory of Jehovah's creation. And the morning of
335,CHAPTER I,the fifth day began.
336,CHAPTER I,
337,CHAPTER I,And Jehovah said let the waters and the earth bring forth living
338,CHAPTER I,"creatures. Things to be in the seas after their kinds, and living"
339,CHAPTER I,creatures to be upon the earth and in the earth. Things that have life
340,CHAPTER I,"to live in the dust of the world, and fowl that they may soar above the"
341,CHAPTER I,earth. And Jehovah and his tribune formed the flesh and bones of fish to
342,CHAPTER I,"live in the waters, his spirit being in the labor and toil of the day."
343,CHAPTER I,He formed great whales and fish of mighty propensities to consume the
344,CHAPTER I,substance of life in the waters. And for them he made Leviathan to be
345,CHAPTER I,their king and a god over them. And the creatures of the waters were in
346,CHAPTER I,"the seas and in the rivers and in the earth, everywhere that there is"
347,CHAPTER I,"water, every one after its kind unchangeable. He also made the fowl upon"
348,CHAPTER I,"the earth out of the clay of the earth, every one after its kind, upon"
349,CHAPTER I,the continents and islands where it should live; and gave to them an
350,CHAPTER I,"order of life as the things of the waters, the female delivering the"
351,CHAPTER I,substance of flesh in an egg; and by the process of heat the shell
352,CHAPTER I,becoming expanded and then the spirit of the fowl entering into the
353,CHAPTER I,"substance through the expanded pores of the shell, forming flesh to"
354,CHAPTER I,"itself, while containing knowledge of the world. As soon as its flesh is"
355,CHAPTER I,strong enough it mines a passage for itself through the shell and takes
356,CHAPTER I,its flesh into the world. And Jehovah made the beasts out of the earth
357,CHAPTER I,"after their kinds, in their forms upon the islands and continents where"
358,CHAPTER I,"they should live. And the Tribune formed all manner of beasts, both"
359,CHAPTER I,"great and small, out of the earth. They formed their flesh and bones and"
360,CHAPTER I,cast their souls in them. And they arose up in life a pair of them of
361,CHAPTER I,"every kind, in every part of the earth where the decree had gone forth"
362,CHAPTER I,"that they should live. And they made beasts after the form of man, and"
363,CHAPTER I,"in his appearance of many sizes and shapes, walking upon their two feet"
364,CHAPTER I,"with two hands to handle things as a man. And they were of many colors,"
365,CHAPTER I,"some black and brown and yellow striped, white and spotted and striped"
366,CHAPTER I,with all manner of colors. And they were upon the face of the earth and
367,CHAPTER I,in the waters.
368,CHAPTER I,
369,CHAPTER I,"And Jehovah and his Tribune made huge beasts great in power and form, to"
370,CHAPTER I,dwell upon parts of the earth. The unicorn was larger than the elephant.
371,CHAPTER I,He had horns as the horns of a bull. He was mighty in strength and was a
372,CHAPTER I,ferocious beast. Mazaroth was much larger than the unicorn; he was a
373,CHAPTER I,"beast of the rivers, of the swamps, and glades. Arcturus was a roving"
374,CHAPTER I,beast of the plains; he went in droves in his day. His army stood on the
375,CHAPTER I,plains in the shade of the mountains as a cluster of little hills
376,CHAPTER I,"crouched, beneath the trees. He heeded not the battle cry of man in his"
377,CHAPTER I,ways. Magathuren was a roving beast of the smooth parts of the earth; he
378,CHAPTER I,could not pass up or down a steep incline or step over anything above
379,CHAPTER I,his knees. He had a straight horn with which he lifted the trunks of
380,CHAPTER I,"fallen trees and things out of his way, as he passed to and fro over the"
381,CHAPTER I,earth. Behemoth was also a beast of the plains; he was the largest beast

384,CHAPTER I,also great beasts made to dwell in the seas as well as upon the earth;
385,CHAPTER I,"until the substance, of life was contained. And there went up a mist"
386,CHAPTER I,"from the waters of the earth, and rain fell upon the dry land, bringing"
387,CHAPTER I,forth food for the living things which were made. But as yet Jehovah had
388,CHAPTER I,not made man upon the earth.

398,CHAPTER II,"And Jehovah created a vineyard upon the high lands, from whose mountains"
399,CHAPTER II,flowed away four rivers. Being parted in four ways from the vineyard.
400,CHAPTER II,The first and second are those which encompass the land of Havilah and
401,CHAPTER II,"Ethiopia, and flow into the Caspian Sea. The third and fourth are the"
402,CHAPTER II,Euphrates and Hiddekel which flow into the Persian gulf. And in the
403,CHAPTER II,sixth day Jehovah said let us make man in our own image after our
404,CHAPTER II,likeness in our similitude. And he formed the body of man out of the
405,CHAPTER II,"clay of the earth, with his hands and with his spirit he made him after"
406,CHAPTER II,his own form and likeness. Then he called one of the rebellious souls
407,CHAPTER II,which had been cast out of Heaven and he cast the soul into the body
408,CHAPTER II,"which he had made, and the body arose up with the vigor of life, and"
409,CHAPTER II,"became an active soul before Jehovah, its creator. And he called his"
410,CHAPTER II,"name Adam, because he had made him out of the red clay of the heights,"
411,CHAPTER II,and man was red after the appearance of Jehovah. And Jehovah caused all
412,CHAPTER II,of the beasts to pass before Adam. And Adam gave names to them after
413,CHAPTER II,their kinds. And he called the beast which had hands and feet and stood
414,CHAPTER II,"upright as himself, Serpent. And Jehovah placed Adam in the vineyard to"
415,CHAPTER II,"live, and gave to him the serpent to be his servant, in the garden of"
416,CHAPTER II,rest which he so named Eden. And Jehovah returned about and refrained
417,CHAPTER II,"from his work on the seventh day, and sanctified it as a day of rest."
418,CHAPTER II,And Adam dwelt alone in Eden. And he was lonesome. But after a time
419,CHAPTER II,"Jehovah returned with his hosts, and he said it is not good for Adam to"
420,CHAPTER II,dwell thus alone. I will now make for man his mother. And she shall be
421,CHAPTER II,"wiser and mightier than he in wisdom, and shall be his counselor, and a"
422,CHAPTER II,light to rule over him that his days be many in the earth.
423,CHAPTER II,
424,CHAPTER II,"And Jehovah caused a sleep to come over Adam, and he took out one of his"
425,CHAPTER II,"ribs with the flesh of the bone, and closed up the flesh of Adam. And"
426,CHAPTER II,"out of it he made the body of a child,--leaving Adam twelve ribs on one"
427,CHAPTER II,side and eleven on the other side. But the ribs of the child were even
428,CHAPTER II,twelve on both sides. And Jehovah placed within her a soul and gave her
429,CHAPTER II,"to Adam, and he knew that she had been made of his flesh, and he called"
430,CHAPTER II,"her Woman. And also shall her name be Eve, because she is the beginning"
431,CHAPTER II,of the mothers of man.
432,CHAPTER II,
433,CHAPTER II,And there was a tree which Jehovah had planted in the garden of Eden. As
434,CHAPTER II,"if a hundred feet to the first limb, and the leaves of the tree hung to"
435,CHAPTER II,"the ground--touching the ground on all sides, ""Broad and strong like"
436,CHAPTER II,"rubber, yet with velvet softness. Beneath this tree was the home of Adam"
437,CHAPTER II,"and Eve."" Beneath the downy fragrant leaves they were shielded from all"
438,CHAPTER II,heat and cold. And the eagles and the fowl of the air run into the
439,CHAPTER II,branches of the tree in time of storm. Here in this sublimeness Eve grew
440,CHAPTER II,"up with Adam, and the Serpent was their servant."
441,CHAPTER II,
442,CHAPTER II,The Trees of the vineyard brought forth every thing which was good for
443,CHAPTER II,"food. There were trees which bare fruits large and shining as gold,"
444,CHAPTER II,fruits of all manner colors as a field of stars in glory. A river run
445,CHAPTER II,through the Garden. Crystal waters rifting over fields of beautiful
446,CHAPTER II,stones. The bedellium and onyx stones and much gold abounding in and
447,CHAPTER II,about the waters. And on one side of the river stood a tree which bare
448,CHAPTER II,"fruit twelve times in the year, whose substance would cause one to live"
449,CHAPTER II,forever. It was the tree of life. None that eat of its fruit should
450,CHAPTER II,ever die. From month to month and from year to year it had power to
451,CHAPTER II,renew life perpetually. And on the other side of the river stood a tree
452,CHAPTER II,"which had power to make one wise. It was a tree of knowledge, one whose"
453,CHAPTER II,"fruit would intoxicate and revitalize,--speeding up the action of life,"
454,CHAPTER II,"causing one to think rapidly, and to see with a clearer vision. Setting"
455,CHAPTER II,"the vitalities in a key where they must wear out, bringing forth the"
456,CHAPTER II,order of death. This tree was called the tree of Knowledge of Good and
457,CHAPTER II,"Evil, because its power was the division between man and sin. He could"
458,CHAPTER II,eat of the tree of life and realize the power and nature of life in all
459,CHAPTER II,its glory. But he could not realize the nature and effect of death and
460,CHAPTER II,"sorrow until he should eat of the fruit of the tree of death, and become"
461,CHAPTER II,intoxicated with the mania of its devastating forces. And for this cause
462,CHAPTER II,Jehovah commanded Adam that he should not eat of the fruit of the tree
463,CHAPTER II,of death or come near it.
464,CHAPTER II,
465,CHAPTER II,"But the command was not given to Eve, for she was but a child--left in"
466,CHAPTER II,Adam's keeping. And they dwelt in glory in their home beneath the wings
467,CHAPTER II,of the tree in the vineyard. And they were naked 'But knew it not.'
468,CHAPTER II,"Satan was upon earth, and envied them in their salvation, but he could"
469,CHAPTER II,"not come near the vineyard, neither could he tempt them to sin. For they"
470,CHAPTER II,"were redeemed, and Satan could not break the decree. But when Eve was"
471,CHAPTER II,"grown the servant walked to and fro beyond the templed paradise, and sat"
472,CHAPTER II,with Satan by a pool. And Satan taught the servant how that it could
473,CHAPTER II,become free from its masters. Then she hastened back and came again into
474,CHAPTER II,the vineyard. And Eve stood by the tree of death admiring its beauty.
475,CHAPTER II,"And the servant came and said to her, ""has Jehovah said that you shall"
476,CHAPTER II,"not eat of every tree in this garden?"" And Eve said, ""we may eat of the"
477,CHAPTER II,"fruit of every tree but this tree, which stands in the midst of the"
478,CHAPTER II,"garden we shall not eat of it, neither shall we touch it lest we die."""
479,CHAPTER II,"And the servant said, ""you shall not surely die,--For the Creator he"
480,CHAPTER II,knows that in the day you eat of the fruit of this tree your eyes shall
481,CHAPTER II,be open and you shall become wise like before the fall--as gods knowing
482,CHAPTER II,"the effect of good and evil."""
483,CHAPTER II,
484,CHAPTER II,And when she saw that the tree was good for food and excellent in
485,CHAPTER II,"beauty, she commanded the servant and she brought to her the fruit and"
486,CHAPTER II,she ate of it. Then she was enlightened and was as another woman. Then
487,CHAPTER II,"she with her own hands brought of the fruit to Adam, and when he saw its"
488,CHAPTER II,"power upon her he also ate of the fruit, and the mind of them both were"
489,CHAPTER II,"enlightened, and the mist was removed from over their souls; and they"
490,CHAPTER II,"knew that they were not as the beast, but were naked. And they sewed"
491,CHAPTER II,leaves together for clothes and dwelt in great fear.
492,CHAPTER II,
493,CHAPTER II,And it was so that in the evening time of a day they heard the voice of
494,CHAPTER II,Jehovah as he walked through the garden. And they fled from their temple
495,CHAPTER II,"and hid themselves from his presence among the trees, and were not where"
496,CHAPTER II,"they were wanted to be found. And Jehovah called unto Adam and said,"
497,CHAPTER II,"""where are you Adam?"" And Adam said I heard you talking in the garden"
498,CHAPTER II,"and I was afraid, and I hid myself because I was naked."
499,CHAPTER II,
500,CHAPTER II,And Jehovah said who told you that you was naked? Have you eaten of the
501,CHAPTER II,tree which I commanded thee not to eat? And he said the woman which you
502,CHAPTER II,gave me she gave me of the fruit of the tree and I did eat. And Jehovah
503,CHAPTER II,"said unto Eve, what have you done. And she said the serpent bewitched me"
504,CHAPTER II,"and I did eat. And Jehovah said to the serpent, because you have done"
505,CHAPTER II,this thing you are cursed beyond everything which I have created. Upon
506,CHAPTER II,"your belly you shall travel, and you shall not henceforth eat. In this,"
507,CHAPTER II,that you have caused my children to sin in the process of eating.
508,CHAPTER II,
509,CHAPTER II,"The dust shall be your food, and I shall put envy between your race and"
510,CHAPTER II,"the race of the woman. And she shall bruise your head, and you shall"
511,CHAPTER II,"bruise her heel. And the serpent fell upon the earth before Jehovah, and"
512,CHAPTER II,her arms and legs became into one straight body. And he took her teeth
513,CHAPTER II,out of her mouth so that she should not masticate food. But he left in
514,CHAPTER II,"her mouth the imprints of her teeth, which is yet to be seen in the"
515,CHAPTER II,mouth of the serpent. And he placed great crooked fangs in her mouth and
516,CHAPTER II,filled them with poison. If she should masticate food her own poison
517,CHAPTER II,would destroy her life.
518,CHAPTER II,
519,CHAPTER II,But she was given power to reach forth and to inject the poison of her
520,CHAPTER II,fangs into the flesh of man and other living things--to destroy their
521,CHAPTER II,"lives. Then he parted her tongue in two parts, and upon the end of each"
522,CHAPTER II,"probescue he tied a small round knot, that is the knot which is yet to"
523,CHAPTER II,be seen on the ends of the serpent's tongue unto this day.
524,CHAPTER II,
525,CHAPTER II,"And according to the decree were all the serpents changed, in the"
526,CHAPTER II,process of nature. That they should not again speak with the voice of
527,CHAPTER II,man. But their knowledge was not veiled. And while they cannot speak to
528,CHAPTER II,man; yet while in contact they show their tongues and say with
529,CHAPTER II,"unmistakable signs ""by my speech I cause thee to fall."" This is the life"
530,CHAPTER II,"of the serpent who through envy was finally bound in hell. And to Eve,"
531,CHAPTER II,"he said, ""I will greatly multiply sorrow upon thee. With your children"
532,CHAPTER II,"you shall be distressed. And man shall set thee at naught, and curse his"
533,CHAPTER II,days--defying and bearing rule over thee. And your desire shall be to
534,CHAPTER II,"your man."""
535,CHAPTER II,
536,CHAPTER II,"And unto Adam he said ""because you have eaten of the tree which I"
537,CHAPTER II,"commanded thee not to eat, cursed is the fruit of the ground for your"
538,CHAPTER II,sake. They shall come forth in thistles and thorns before thee. And you
539,CHAPTER II,"shall turn unto the herbs of the field for food, and shall spend your"
540,CHAPTER II,"days in toil, eating of the vintage in sorrow, until you return unto the"
541,CHAPTER II,ground from which you was taken. Dust you are and unto the dust you
542,CHAPTER II,"shall return."" And he drove Adam and Eve out of paradise, and left an"
543,CHAPTER II,"angel to keep the vineyard, from whose sword issued a stream of power"
544,CHAPTER II,like fire as he turned about every way upon the plains.
545,CHAPTER II,
546,CHAPTER II,And Adam and Eve went out a little ways from Edon northward towards the
547,CHAPTER II,"Caspian Sea, and set up for themselves a place of abode, and soon began"
548,CHAPTER II,to till the earth. And Eve became the mother of children. Her first born
549,CHAPTER II,"son she called Node, and she bare him also a sister and called her name"
550,CHAPTER II,Midre. And Node went forth with his sister to the Eastward of Edon. And
551,CHAPTER II,"in time there built a city, which was called the City of Nod. But Node"
552,CHAPTER II,was a man of sin.
553,CHAPTER II,
554,CHAPTER II,"And again Eve bare Havilah, and his sister Zillah. But he also was a man"
555,CHAPTER II,"of sin. And he dwelt to the west, and proclaimed a land which was called"
556,CHAPTER II,"the land of Havilah. And again Eve bare Cain, and she said he is a man"
557,CHAPTER II,"to serve Jehovah. And she bare also his brother Abul, one to seek the"
558,CHAPTER II,will of Jehovah. And Adah and her brothers and sisters were also born
559,CHAPTER II,unto the house of Adam.
560,CHAPTER II,
561,CHAPTER II,And Cain and Abul sought to worship Jehovah. And Abul offered of the
562,CHAPTER II,"noblest of his sheep as a sacrifice to Jehovah, and Jehovah was well"
563,CHAPTER II,pleased with his offering. And then Cain offered of the finest of his
564,CHAPTER II,"fruit of his harvest. And Jehovah had no respect for his sacrifice,"
565,CHAPTER II,"saying, ""why bring of the things before me which I have defamed."
566,CHAPTER II,Redemption shall be found alone in the blood of that which I have not
567,CHAPTER II,"cursed."" Then Cain was very wroth, and Jehovah said unto him repent;"
568,CHAPTER II,but he would not.
569,CHAPTER II,
570,CHAPTER II,And in process of time as he talked with Abul in a field he arose up
571,CHAPTER II,against him and slew him. And the soul of Abul cried unto Jehovah from
572,CHAPTER II,the earth. And he said to Cain the voice of your brother's soul cries
573,CHAPTER II,unto me from the ground. And now are you cursed in the blessings of the
574,CHAPTER II,earth which has received your brother's blood by your hand. When you
575,CHAPTER II,till the soil it shall not yield unto you her strength. A fugitive and a
576,CHAPTER II,"vagabond shall you be in the earth. And Cain repented and said, ""my"
577,CHAPTER II,punishment is greater than I can bear; you have driven me out from among
578,CHAPTER II,"the people, and from your face I shall be hid; and it shall come to pass"
579,CHAPTER II,"that if any one should find me that they shall slay me."""
580,CHAPTER II,
581,CHAPTER II,"And Jehovah said to the people, whosoever slays Cain, ""Vengeance shall"
582,CHAPTER II,"be taken upon him seven fold."" And he set a mark upon Cain's forehead of"
583,CHAPTER II,many colors. And Cain went from the presence of Jehovah and dwelt in the
584,CHAPTER II,land of Nod. And in time he became the father of a generation. But his
585,CHAPTER II,"days were evil and sullen, and when he was aged a lad slew him with an"

1512,CHAPTER II,"1. In the twilight I wandered by the old home place, and I saw it lie in"
1513,CHAPTER II,wreck; all was vanity and despair. I sought for the things that belonged
1514,CHAPTER II,"to my childhood days, but none of them were there."
1515,CHAPTER II,
1516,CHAPTER II,"2. The old apple tree which stood by the gate, had aged and fallen"
1517,CHAPTER II,"almost away. Its branches were drooped and crisp with time, through"
1518,CHAPTER II,which I used to chase in games of play.
1519,CHAPTER II,
1520,CHAPTER II,3. I looked away to the old house which stood midst the terrace blue. I
1521,CHAPTER II,"thought of the days of my childhood ways, but storm and drear had"
1522,CHAPTER II,changed things to an age of bronzed hue.
1523,CHAPTER II,
1524,CHAPTER II,"4. My old rose was gone which stood by the doorway, resting its hands"
1525,CHAPTER II,against the wall. And seemed to watch me as I would fleet across the
1526,CHAPTER II,"terrace, as if to guard against my fall."
1527,CHAPTER II,
1528,CHAPTER II,"5. I went to look through the garden of the days of long ago, and I saw"
1529,CHAPTER II,"that my brook lay mired and neglected, which so proudly through its"
1530,CHAPTER II,vintage once did flow.
1531,CHAPTER II,
1532,CHAPTER II,"6. My old oak, too, had fallen which stood by the garden wall; crowned"
1533,CHAPTER II,with azure gray like the light of fall. Casting its shadows across our
1534,CHAPTER II,"brook, it was so strong, so mighty, and tall."
1535,CHAPTER II,
1536,CHAPTER II,"7. My cherry trees and the peaches, too, were gone, some hand had cast"
1537,CHAPTER II,them aside. And the lilies and the magnolias and all the orchard
1538,CHAPTER II,beauties of my childhood pride.
1539,CHAPTER II,
1540,CHAPTER II,8. There were only tiny fragments of our ships which in the rustic brook
1541,CHAPTER II,still yet did lie. When since so short a time when our gay sails and
1542,CHAPTER II,flags upon its waters did fly.
1543,CHAPTER II,
1544,CHAPTER II,"9. There had been a great rain out upon the hills, and our brook had"

1547,CHAPTER II,
1548,CHAPTER II,10. We set our ships in order and gave up our brave young lives to

1550,CHAPTER II,lower gate.
1551,CHAPTER II,
1552,CHAPTER II,11. The tide rose high and turbulent and cast our ships upon a foreign

1555,CHAPTER II,
