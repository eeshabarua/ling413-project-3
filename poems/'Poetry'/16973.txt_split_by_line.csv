200,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,From the west wind's verge even to the arduous east's
201,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,The splendour of the shadow that it flings
202,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,Makes fire and storm in heaven above the feasts

210,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,"Heaven, yearning toward the day,"
211,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,Shines with its thunder and round its lightning rings;
212,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,And never hand yet earlier played

219,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,"More soft than slumber's, fell the first note's sound"
220,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,From strings the swift young hand strayed lightlier through
221,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,Than leaves through calm air wheeling toward the ground
222,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,Stray down the drifting wind when skies are blue
223,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,"Nor yet the wings of latter winds unbound,"
224,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,Ere winter loosen all the Æolian crew
225,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,With storm unleashed behind them like a hound.
226,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,As lightly rose and sank
227,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,Beside a green-flowered bank
228,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,The clear first notes his burning boyhood found
229,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,To sing her sacred praise
230,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,Who rode her city's ways
231,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,Clothed with bright hair and with high purpose crowned;
232,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,"A song of soft presageful breath,"
233,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,Prefiguring all his love and faith in life and death;

240,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,"Of goodly beauty in women, whence all days"
241,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,Take light whereby death's self seems transitory;
242,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,"And loftier love than loveliest eyes can raise,"
243,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,Love that wipes off the miry stains and gory
244,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,"From Time's worn feet, besmirched on bloodred ways,"
245,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,And lightens with his light the night of story;
246,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,Love that lifts up from dust
247,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,"Life, and makes darkness just,"
248,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,And purges as with fire of purgatory
249,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,"The dense disastrous air,"
250,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,To burn old falsehood bare
251,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,And give the wind its ashes heaped and hoary;
252,_SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR._,"Love, that with eyes of ageless youth"

1217,ARISTOPHANES,_Attempted in English verse after the original metre._
1218,ARISTOPHANES,
1219,ARISTOPHANES,
1220,ARISTOPHANES,I was allured into the audacity of this experiment by consideration of a
1221,ARISTOPHANES,fact which hitherto does not seem to have been taken into consideration
1222,ARISTOPHANES,by any translator of the half divine humourist in whose incomparable
1223,ARISTOPHANES,genius the highest qualities of Rabelais were fused and harmonized with
1224,ARISTOPHANES,"the supremest gifts of Shelley: namely, that his marvellous metrical"
1225,ARISTOPHANES,invention of the anapæstic heptameter was almost exactly reproducible in
1226,ARISTOPHANES,"a language to which all variations and combinations of anapæstic,"
1227,ARISTOPHANES,"iambic, or trochaic metre are as natural and pliable as all dactylic and"
1228,ARISTOPHANES,"spondaic forms of verse are unnatural and abhorrent. As it happens, this"
1229,ARISTOPHANES,highest central interlude of a most adorable masterpiece is as easy to
1230,ARISTOPHANES,"detach from its dramatic setting, and even from its lyrical context, as"
1231,ARISTOPHANES,it was easy to give line for line of it in English. In two metrical
1232,ARISTOPHANES,points only does my version vary from the verbal pattern of the
1233,ARISTOPHANES,"original. I have of course added rhymes, and double rhymes, as necessary"
1234,ARISTOPHANES,makeweights for the imperfection of an otherwise inadequate language;
1235,ARISTOPHANES,and equally of course I have not attempted the impossible and
1236,ARISTOPHANES,undesirable task of reproducing the rare exceptional effect of a line
1237,ARISTOPHANES,overcharged on purpose with a preponderance of heavy-footed spondees:
1238,ARISTOPHANES,and this for the obvious reason that even if such a line--which I
1239,ARISTOPHANES,"doubt--could be exactly represented, foot by foot and pause for pause,"
1240,ARISTOPHANES,"in English, this English line would no more be a verse in any proper"
1241,ARISTOPHANES,sense of the word than is the line I am writing at this moment. And my
1242,ARISTOPHANES,"main intention, or at least my main desire, in the undertaking of this"
1243,ARISTOPHANES,"brief adventure, was to renew as far as possible for English ears the"
1244,ARISTOPHANES,"music of this resonant and triumphant metre, which goes ringing at full"
1245,ARISTOPHANES,gallop as of horses who
1246,ARISTOPHANES,
1247,ARISTOPHANES,'dance as 'twere to the music
1248,ARISTOPHANES,Their own hoofs make.'
1249,ARISTOPHANES,
1250,ARISTOPHANES,I would not seem over curious in search of an apt or inapt quotation:
1251,ARISTOPHANES,but nothing can be fitter than a verse of Shakespeare's to praise at
1252,ARISTOPHANES,once and to describe the most typical verse of Aristophanes.

1724,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Hangs as in heavy suspense, charged with irresolute light,"
1725,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,Softly the soul of the sunset upholden awhile on the sterile

1727,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,Inland glimmer the shallows asleep and afar in the breathless
1728,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,Twilight: yonder the depths darken afar and asleep.
1729,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,Slowly the semblance of death out of heaven descends on the deathless
1730,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,Waters: hardly the light lives on the face of the deep--

1762,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Nay, not so, but at least for a little, awhile at the golden"
1763,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,Limit of arching air fain for an hour to delay.

1771,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Breath, yet fain to revive, as it seems, from the skirt of the shroud."
1772,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,Faintly the heartbeats shorten and pause of the light in the westward
1773,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Heaven, as eastward quicken the paces of star upon star"
1774,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,Hurried and eager of life as a child that strains to the breast-ward
1775,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Eagerly, yearning forth of the deeps where the ways of them are,"
1776,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Glad of the glory of the gift of their life and the wealth of its wonder,"

1782,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Heavily heaped up, changefully changeless, void though of danger"

1786,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,As the wall of a prison imprisoning the mere is the girth of it lifted:

1794,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"High overhead seems ever the sea-line fixed as a mark,"
1795,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,And the shore where I stand as a valley beholden of hills whence thunder

1799,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"A wall of turbid water, aslope to the wide sky's wonder"
1800,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Of colour and cloud, it climbs, or spreads as a slanted floor."
1801,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,And the large lights change on the face of the mere like things that were

1803,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Winged and wonderful, beams like as birds are that pass and are free:"
1804,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"But the light is dense as darkness, a gift withheld in the giving,"
1805,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,That lies as dead on the fierce dull face of the landward sea.
1806,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Stained and stifled and soiled, made earthier than earth is and duller,"
1807,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Grimly she puts back light as rejected, a thing put away:"
1808,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"No transparent rapture, a molten music of colour;"
1809,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,No translucent love taken and given of the day.
1810,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Fettered and marred and begrimed is the light's live self on her falling,"
1811,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,As the light of a man's life lighted the fume of a dungeon mars:
1812,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Only she knows of the wind, when her wrath gives ear to him calling;"
1813,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"The delight of the light she knows not, nor answers the sun or the stars."
1814,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,Love she hath none to return for the luminous love of their giving:
1815,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,None to reflect from the bitter and shallow response of her heart
1816,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Yearly she feeds on her dead, yet herself seems dead and not living,"
1817,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,Or confused as a soul heavy-laden with trouble that will not depart.
1818,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"In the sound of her speech to the darkness the moan of her evil remorse is,"
1819,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Haply, for strong ships gnawed by the dog-toothed sea-bank's fang"
1820,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,And trampled to death by the rage of the feet of her foam-lipped horses
1821,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Whose manes are yellow as plague, and as ensigns of pestilence hang,"
1822,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,That wave in the foul faint air of the breath of a death-stricken city;
1823,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"So menacing heaves she the manes of her rollers knotted with sand,"
1824,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Discoloured, opaque, suspended in sign as of strength without pity,"
1825,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,That shake with flameless thunder the low long length of the strand.
1826,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Here, far off in the farther extreme of the shore as it lengthens"
1827,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Northward, lonely for miles, ere ever a village begin,"
1828,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,On the lapsing land that recedes as the growth of the strong sea
1829,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,strengthens
1830,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Shoreward, thrusting further and further its outworks in,"
1831,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Here in Shakespeare's vision, a flower of her kin forsaken,"
1832,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Lay in her golden raiment alone on the wild wave's edge,"
1833,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Surely by no shore else, but here on the bank storm-shaken,"
1834,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Perdita, bright as a dew-drop engilt of the sun on the sedge."
1835,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,Here on a shore unbeheld of his eyes in a dream he beheld her
1836,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Outcast, fair as a fairy, the child of a far-off king:"
1837,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,And over the babe-flower gently the head of a pastoral elder
1838,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Bowed, compassionate, hoar as the hawthorn-blossom in spring,"
1839,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,And kind as harvest in autumn: a shelter of shade on the lonely
1840,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,Shelterless unknown shore scourged of implacable waves:
1841,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Here, where the wind walks royal, alone in his kingdom, and only"
1842,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,Sounds to the sedges a wail as of triumph that conquers and craves.

1844,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,From barren and stagnant slumber at only the sound of his breath:
1845,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Yet the hunger is eased not that aches in his heart, nor the goal overtaken"
1846,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,That his wide wings yearn for and labour as hearts that yearn after
1847,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,death.
1848,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,All the solitude sighs and expects with a blind expectation
1849,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Somewhat unknown of its own sad heart, grown heart-sick of strife:"
1850,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"Till sometime its wild heart maddens, and moans, and the vast ululation"

1855,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,Darken and lighten the darkness and light of it thickened or thinned;
1856,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,But the heart that impels them is even as a conqueror's insatiably craving
1857,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"That victory can fill not, as power cannot satiate the want of the wind."
1858,_EVENING ON THE BROADS._,"All these moorlands and marshes are full of his might, and oppose not"

2262,BY THE NORTH SEA,BY THE NORTH SEA
2263,BY THE NORTH SEA,
2264,BY THE NORTH SEA,
2265,I.,I.
2266,I.,
2267,I.,1.
2268,I.,
2269,I.,A land that is lonelier than ruin;
2270,I.,A sea that is stranger than death:
2271,I.,"Far fields that a rose never blew in,"
2272,I.,Wan waste where the winds lack breath;
2273,I.,Waste endless and boundless and flowerless
2274,I.,But of marsh-blossoms fruitless as free:
2275,I.,"Where earth lies exhausted, as powerless"
2276,I.,To strive with the sea.
2277,I.,
2278,I.,2.
2279,I.,
2280,I.,"Far flickers the flight of the swallows,"
2281,I.,Far flutters the weft of the grass
2282,I.,Spun dense over desolate hollows
2283,I.,More pale than the clouds as they pass:
2284,I.,Thick woven as the weft of a witch is
2285,I.,"Round the heart of a thrall that hath sinned,"
2286,I.,Whose youth and the wrecks of its riches
2287,I.,Are waifs on the wind.
2288,I.,
2289,I.,3.
2290,I.,
2291,I.,"The pastures are herdless and sheepless,"
2292,I.,No pasture or shelter for herds:
2293,I.,"The wind is relentless and sleepless,"
2294,I.,And restless and songless the birds;
2295,I.,"Their cries from afar fall breathless,"
2296,I.,Their wings are as lightnings that flee;
2297,I.,For the land has two lords that are deathless:
2298,I.,"Death's self, and the sea."
2299,I.,
2300,I.,4.
2301,I.,
2302,I.,"These twain, as a king with his fellow,"
2303,I.,Hold converse of desolate speech:
2304,I.,And her waters are haggard and yellow
2305,I.,And crass with the scurf of the beach:
2306,I.,And his garments are grey as the hoary
2307,I.,Wan sky where the day lies dim;
2308,I.,"And his power is to her, and his glory,"
2309,I.,As hers unto him.
2310,I.,
2311,I.,5.
2312,I.,
2313,I.,"In the pride of his power she rejoices,"
2314,I.,In her glory he glows and is glad:
2315,I.,"In her darkness the sound of his voice is,"
2316,I.,With his breath she dilates and is mad:
2317,I.,"'If thou slay me, O death, and outlive me,"
2318,I.,Yet thy love hath fulfilled me of thee.'
2319,I.,"'Shall I give thee not back if thou give me,"
2320,I.,"O sister, O sea?'"
2321,I.,
2322,I.,6.
2323,I.,
2324,I.,"And year upon year dawns living,"
2325,I.,And age upon age drops dead:
2326,I.,"And his hand is not weary of giving,"
2327,I.,And the thirst of her heart is not fed:
2328,I.,"And the hunger that moans in her passion,"
2329,I.,"And the rage in her hunger that roars,"
2330,I.,"As a wolf's that the winter lays lash on,"
2331,I.,Still calls and implores.
2332,I.,
2333,I.,7.
2334,I.,
2335,I.,"Her walls have no granite for girder,"
2336,I.,No fortalice fronting her stands:
2337,I.,But reefs the bloodguiltiest of murder
2338,I.,Are less than the banks of her sands:
2339,I.,These number their slain by the thousand;
2340,I.,"For the ship hath no surety to be,"
2341,I.,When the bank is abreast of her bows and
2342,I.,Aflush with the sea.
2343,I.,
2344,I.,8.
2345,I.,
2346,I.,"No surety to stand, and no shelter"
2347,I.,"To dawn out of darkness but one,"
2348,I.,Out of waters that hurtle and welter
2349,I.,No succour to dawn with the sun
2350,I.,"But a rest from the wind as it passes,"
2351,I.,"Where, hardly redeemed from the waves,"
2352,I.,Lie thick as the blades of the grasses
2353,I.,The dead in their graves.
2354,I.,
2355,I.,9.
2356,I.,
2357,I.,"A multitude noteless of numbers,"
2358,I.,As wild weeds cast on an heap:
2359,I.,"And sounder than sleep are their slumbers,"
2360,I.,And softer than song is their sleep;
2361,I.,And sweeter than all things and stranger
2362,I.,"The sense, if perchance it may be,"
2363,I.,That the wind is divested of danger
2364,I.,And scatheless the sea.
2365,I.,
2366,I.,10.
2367,I.,
2368,I.,That the roar of the banks they breasted
2369,I.,"Is hurtless as bellowing of herds,"
2370,I.,And the strength of his wings that invested
2371,I.,"The wind, as the strength of a bird's;"
2372,I.,As the sea-mew's might or the swallow's
2373,I.,"That cry to him back if he cries,"
2374,I.,As over the graves and their hollows
2375,I.,Days darken and rise.
2376,I.,
2377,I.,11.
2378,I.,
2379,I.,As the souls of the dead men disburdened
2380,I.,"And clean of the sins that they sinned,"
2381,I.,With a lovelier than man's life guerdoned
2382,I.,"And delight as a wave's in the wind,"
2383,I.,"And delight as the wind's in the billow,"
2384,I.,"Birds pass, and deride with their glee"
2385,I.,The flesh that has dust for its pillow
2386,I.,As wrecks have the sea.
2387,I.,
2388,I.,12.
2389,I.,
2390,I.,"When the ways of the sun wax dimmer,"
2391,I.,Wings flash through the dusk like beams;
2392,I.,"As the clouds in the lit sky glimmer,"
2393,I.,The bird in the graveyard gleams;
2394,I.,As the cloud at its wing's edge whitens
2395,I.,"When the clarions of sunrise are heard,"
2396,I.,The graves that the bird's note brightens
2397,I.,Grow bright for the bird.
2398,I.,
2399,I.,13.
2400,I.,
2401,I.,As the waves of the numberless waters
2402,I.,That the wind cannot number who guides
2403,I.,Are the sons of the shore and the daughters
2404,I.,Here lulled by the chime of the tides:
2405,I.,And here in the press of them standing
2406,I.,We know not if these or if we
2407,I.,"Live truliest, or anchored to landing"
2408,I.,Or drifted to sea.
2409,I.,
2410,I.,14.
2411,I.,
2412,I.,In the valley he named of decision
2413,I.,No denser were multitudes met
2414,I.,When the soul of the seer in her vision
2415,I.,Saw nations for doom of them set;
2416,I.,"Saw darkness in dawn, and the splendour"
2417,I.,"Of judgment, the sword and the rod;"
2418,I.,But the doom here of death is more tender
2419,I.,And gentler the god.
2420,I.,
2421,I.,15.
2422,I.,
2423,I.,And gentler the wind from the dreary
2424,I.,"Sea-banks by the waves overlapped,"
2425,I.,"Being weary, speaks peace to the weary"
2426,I.,From slopes that the tide-stream hath sapped;
2427,I.,And sweeter than all that we call so
2428,I.,The seal of their slumber shall be
2429,I.,Till the graves that embosom them also
2430,I.,Be sapped of the sea.
2431,I.,
2432,I.,
2433,II.,II.
2434,II.,
2435,II.,1.
2436,II.,
2437,II.,"For the heart of the waters is cruel,"
2438,II.,"And the kisses are dire of their lips,"
2439,II.,And their waves are as fire is to fuel
2440,II.,"To the strength of the sea-faring ships,"
2441,II.,Though the sea's eye gleam as a jewel
2442,II.,To the sun's eye back as he dips.
2443,II.,
2444,II.,2.
2445,II.,
2446,II.,Though the sun's eye flash to the sea's
2447,II.,"Live light of delight and of laughter,"
2448,II.,And her lips breathe back to the breeze
2449,II.,The kiss that the wind's lips waft her
2450,II.,"From the sun that subsides, and sees"
2451,II.,No gleam of the storm's dawn after.
2452,II.,
2453,II.,3.
2454,II.,
2455,II.,And the wastes of the wild sea-marches
2456,II.,Where the borderers are matched in their might--
2457,II.,"Bleak fens that the sun's weight parches,"
2458,II.,Dense waves that reject his light--
2459,II.,Change under the change-coloured arches
2460,II.,Of changeless morning and night
2461,II.,
2462,II.,4.
2463,II.,
2464,II.,The waves are as ranks enrolled
2465,II.,Too close for the storm to sever:
2466,II.,"The fens lie naked and cold,"
2467,II.,But their heart fails utterly never:
2468,II.,"The lists are set from of old,"
2469,II.,And the warfare endureth for ever.
2470,II.,
2471,II.,
2472,III.,III.
2473,III.,
2474,III.,1.
2475,III.,
2476,III.,"Miles, and miles, and miles of desolation!"
2477,III.,Leagues on leagues on leagues without a change!
2478,III.,Sign or token of some eldest nation
2479,III.,Here would make the strange land not so strange.
2480,III.,"Time-forgotten, yea since time's creation,"
2481,III.,Seem these borders where the sea-birds range.
2482,III.,
2483,III.,2.
2484,III.,
2485,III.,"Slowly, gladly, full of peace and wonder"
2486,III.,Grows his heart who journeys here alone.
2487,III.,Earth and all its thoughts of earth sink under
2488,III.,Deep as deep in water sinks a stone.
2489,III.,"Hardly knows it if the rollers thunder,"
2490,III.,Hardly whence the lonely wind is blown.
2491,III.,
2492,III.,3.
2493,III.,
2494,III.,"Tall the plumage of the rush-flower tosses,"
2495,III.,Sharp and soft in many a curve and line
2496,III.,"Gleam and glow the sea-coloured marsh-mosses,"
2497,III.,Salt and splendid from the circling brine.
2498,III.,Streak on streak of glimmering seashine crosses
2499,III.,All the land sea-saturate as with wine.
2500,III.,
2501,III.,4.
2502,III.,
2503,III.,"Far, and far between, in divers orders,"
2504,III.,Clear grey steeples cleave the low grey sky;
2505,III.,"Fast and firm as time-unshaken warders,"
2506,III.,"Hearts made sure by faith, by hope made high."
2507,III.,These alone in all the wild sea-borders
2508,III.,Fear no blast of days and nights that die.
2509,III.,
2510,III.,5.
2511,III.,
2512,III.,"All the land is like as one man's face is,"
2513,III.,Pale and troubled still with change of cares.
2514,III.,Doubt and death pervade her clouded spaces:
2515,III.,Strength and length of life and peace are theirs;
2516,III.,Theirs alone amid these weary places.
2517,III.,Seeing not how the wild world frets and fares.
2518,III.,
2519,III.,6.
2520,III.,
2521,III.,Firm and fast where all is cloud that changes
2522,III.,"Cloud-clogged sunlight, cloud by sunlight thinned,"
2523,III.,"Stern and sweet, above the sand-hill ranges"
2524,III.,Watch the towers and tombs of men that sinned
2525,III.,"Once, now calm as earth whose only change is"
2526,III.,"Wind, and light, and wind, and cloud, and wind."
2527,III.,
2528,III.,7.
2529,III.,
2530,III.,"Out and in and out the sharp straits wander,"
2531,III.,"In and out and in the wild way strives,"
2532,III.,Starred and paved and lined with flowers that squander
2533,III.,"Gold as golden as the gold of hives,"
2534,III.,"Salt and moist and multiform: but yonder,"
2535,III.,"See, what sign of life or death survives?"
2536,III.,
2537,III.,8.
2538,III.,
2539,III.,Seen then only when the songs of olden
2540,III.,"Harps were young whose echoes yet endure,"
2541,III.,"Hymned of Homer when his years were golden,"
2542,III.,"Known of only when the world was pure,"
2543,III.,"Here is Hades, manifest, beholden,"
2544,III.,"Surely, surely here, if aught be sure!"
2545,III.,
2546,III.,9.
2547,III.,
2548,III.,"Where the border-line was crossed, that, sundering"
2549,III.,"Death from life, keeps weariness from rest,"
2550,III.,"None can tell, who fares here forward wondering;"
2551,III.,None may doubt but here might end his quest.
2552,III.,Here life's lightning joys and woes once thundering
2553,III.,Sea-like round him cease like storm suppressed.
2554,III.,
2555,III.,10.
2556,III.,
2557,III.,Here the wise wave-wandering steadfast-hearted
2558,III.,Guest of many a lord of many a land
2559,III.,"Saw the shape or shade of years departed,"
2560,III.,"Saw the semblance risen and hard at hand,"
2561,III.,"Saw the mother long from love's reach parted,"
2562,III.,"Anticleia, like a statue stand."
2563,III.,
2564,III.,11.
2565,III.,
2566,III.,"Statue? nay, nor tissued image woven"
2567,III.,Fair on hangings in his father's hall;
2568,III.,"Nay, too fast her faith of heart was proven,"
2569,III.,Far too firm her loveliest love of all;
2570,III.,"Love wherethrough the loving heart was cloven,"
2571,III.,Love that hears not when the loud Fates call.
2572,III.,
2573,III.,12.
2574,III.,
2575,III.,Love that lives and stands up re-created
2576,III.,Then when life has ebbed and anguish fled;
2577,III.,"Love more strong than death or all things fated,"
2578,III.,"Child's and mother's, lit by love and led;"
2579,III.,Love that found what life so long awaited
2580,III.,"Here, when life came down among the dead."
2581,III.,
2582,III.,13.
2583,III.,
2584,III.,"Here, where never came alive another,"
2585,III.,Came her son across the sundering tide
2586,III.,Crossed before by many a warrior brother
2587,III.,Once that warred on Ilion at his side;
2588,III.,Here spread forth vain hands to clasp the mother
2589,III.,"Dead, that sorrowing for his love's sake died."
2590,III.,
2591,III.,14.
2592,III.,
2593,III.,"Parted, though by narrowest of divisions,"
2594,III.,"Clasp he might not, only might implore,"
2595,III.,"Sundered yet by bitterest of derisions,"
2596,III.,"Son, and mother from the son she bore--"
2597,III.,Here? But all dispeopled here of visions
2598,III.,"Lies, forlorn of shadows even, the shore."
2599,III.,
2600,III.,15.
2601,III.,
2602,III.,"All too sweet such men's Hellenic speech is,"
2603,III.,"All too fain they lived of light to see,"
2604,III.,"Once to see the darkness of these beaches,"
2605,III.,Once to sing this Hades found of me
2606,III.,"Ghostless, all its gulfs and creeks and reaches,"
2607,III.,"Sky, and shore, and cloud, and waste, and sea."
2608,III.,
2609,III.,
2610,IV.,IV.
2611,IV.,
2612,IV.,1.
2613,IV.,
2614,IV.,But aloft and afront of me faring
2615,IV.,Far forward as folk in a dream
2616,IV.,"That strive, between doubting and daring"
2617,IV.,"Right on till the goal for them gleam,"
2618,IV.,"Full forth till their goal on them lighten,"
2619,IV.,"The harbour where fain they would be,"
2620,IV.,What headlands there darken and brighten?
2621,IV.,What change in the sea?
2622,IV.,
2623,IV.,2.
2624,IV.,
2625,IV.,What houses and woodlands that nestle
2626,IV.,Safe inland to lee of the hill
2627,IV.,As it slopes from the headlands that wrestle
2628,IV.,And succumb to the strong sea's will?
2629,IV.,"Truce is not, nor respite, nor pity,"
2630,IV.,For the battle is waged not of hands
2631,IV.,Where over the grave of a city
2632,IV.,The ghost of it stands.
2633,IV.,
2634,IV.,3.
2635,IV.,
2636,IV.,"Where the wings of the sea-wind slacken,"
2637,IV.,"Green lawns to the landward thrive,"
2638,IV.,"Fields brighten and pine-woods blacken,"
2639,IV.,And the heat in their heart is alive;
2640,IV.,"They blossom and warble and murmur,"
2641,IV.,For the sense of their spirit is free:
2642,IV.,But harder to shoreward and firmer
2643,IV.,The grasp of the sea.
2644,IV.,
2645,IV.,4.
2646,IV.,
2647,IV.,"Like ashes the low cliffs crumble,"
2648,IV.,"The banks drop down into dust,"
2649,IV.,"The heights of the hills are made humble,"
2650,IV.,As a reed's is the strength of their trust:
2651,IV.,"As a city's that armies environ,"
2652,IV.,The strength of their stay is of sand:
2653,IV.,"But the grasp of the sea is as iron,"
2654,IV.,Laid hard on the land.
2655,IV.,
2656,IV.,5.
2657,IV.,
2658,IV.,A land that is thirstier than ruin;
2659,IV.,A sea that is hungrier than death;
2660,IV.,Heaped hills that a tree never grew in;
2661,IV.,Wide sands where the wave draws breath;
2662,IV.,All solace is here for the spirit
2663,IV.,That ever for ever may be
2664,IV.,"For the soul of thy son to inherit,"
2665,IV.,"My mother, my sea."
2666,IV.,
2667,IV.,6.
2668,IV.,
2669,IV.,O delight of the headlands and beaches!
2670,IV.,"O desire of the wind on the wold,"
2671,IV.,More glad than a man's when it reaches
2672,IV.,That end which it sought from of old
2673,IV.,And the palm of possession is dreary
2674,IV.,To the sense that in search of it sinned;
2675,IV.,But nor satisfied ever nor weary
2676,IV.,Is ever the wind.
2677,IV.,
2678,IV.,7.
2679,IV.,
2680,IV.,The delight that he takes but in living
2681,IV.,Is more than of all things that live:
2682,IV.,For the world that has all things for giving
2683,IV.,Has nothing so goodly to give:
2684,IV.,"But more than delight his desire is,"
2685,IV.,For the goal where his pinions would be
2686,IV.,"Is immortal as air or as fire is,"
2687,IV.,Immense as the sea.
2688,IV.,
2689,IV.,8.
2690,IV.,
2691,IV.,Though hence come the moan that he borrows
2692,IV.,"From darkness and depth of the night,"
2693,IV.,"Though hence be the spring of his sorrows,"
2694,IV.,Hence too is the joy of his might;
2695,IV.,The delight that his doom is for ever
2696,IV.,"To seek and desire and rejoice,"
2697,IV.,And the sense that eternity never
2698,IV.,Shall silence his voice.
2699,IV.,
2700,IV.,9.
2701,IV.,
2702,IV.,That satiety never may stifle
2703,IV.,Nor weariness ever estrange
2704,IV.,Nor time be so strong as to rifle
2705,IV.,Nor change be so great as to change
2706,IV.,His gift that renews in the giving.
2707,IV.,The joy that exalts him to be
2708,IV.,Alone of all elements living
2709,IV.,The lord of the sea.
2710,IV.,
2711,IV.,10.
2712,IV.,
2713,IV.,"What is fire, that its flame should consume her?"
2714,IV.,More fierce than all fires are her waves:
2715,IV.,"What is earth, that its gulfs should entomb her?"
2716,IV.,More deep are her own than their graves.
2717,IV.,Life shrinks from his pinions that cover
2718,IV.,The darkness by thunders bedinned:
2719,IV.,"But she knows him, her lord and her lover,"
2720,IV.,The godhead of wind.
2721,IV.,
2722,IV.,11.
2723,IV.,
2724,IV.,"For a season his wings are about her,"
2725,IV.,His breath on her lips for a space;
2726,IV.,Such rapture he wins not without her
2727,IV.,In the width of his worldwide race.
2728,IV.,"Though the forests bow down, and the mountains"
2729,IV.,"Wax dark, and the tribes of them flee,"
2730,IV.,His delight is more deep in the fountains
2731,IV.,And springs of the sea.
2732,IV.,
2733,IV.,12.
2734,IV.,
2735,IV.,"There are those too of mortals that love him,"
2736,IV.,"There are souls that desire and require,"
2737,IV.,Be the glories of midnight above him
2738,IV.,Or beneath him the daysprings of fire:
2739,IV.,And their hearts are as harps that approve him
2740,IV.,And praise him as chords of a lyre
2741,IV.,That were fain with their music to move him
2742,IV.,To meet their desire.
2743,IV.,
2744,IV.,13.
2745,IV.,
2746,IV.,"To descend through the darkness to grace them,"
2747,IV.,Till darkness were lovelier than light:
2748,IV.,"To encompass and grasp and embrace them,"
2749,IV.,Till their weakness were one with his might:
2750,IV.,"With the strength of his wings to caress them,"
2751,IV.,With the blast of his breath to set free;
2752,IV.,With the mouths of his thunders to bless them
2753,IV.,For sons of the sea.
2754,IV.,
2755,IV.,14.
2756,IV.,
2757,IV.,For these have the toil and the guerdon
2758,IV.,That the wind has eternally: these

2760,IV.,"Of the sleepless unsatisfied breeze,"

2764,IV.,The sense of his song.
2765,IV.,
2766,IV.,15.
2767,IV.,
2768,IV.,For the wind's is their doom and their blessing;
2769,IV.,"To desire, and have always above"
2770,IV.,"A possession beyond their possessing,"
2771,IV.,A love beyond reach of their love.
2772,IV.,"Green earth has her sons and her daughters,"

2785,V.,"As ours, and as ours are her pains:"

3002,VII.,
3003,VII.,Though the Gods of the night lie rotten
