15,,_The_ Lost Temples of Xantoos

17,,By HOWELL CALHOUN

20,,"Celestial fantasies of deathless night,"
21,,"Enraptured colonnades adorned with pearls,"
22,,"Resplendent guardians of crimson light,"
23,,Expanse of darkness silently unfurls
24,,"Among colossal ruins on this shore,"
25,,That once was purled by Xantoos' rolling seas;
26,,Nothing remains upon this barren core
27,,"Of Mars, but your palatial memories."
28,,
29,,Your altars and magnificent black gods
30,,"Still flash beneath the sapphire torches' flames,"
31,,The fragrant ring of sacred flowers nods
32,,Beneath the monstrous idols' gilded frames.
33,,Your jeweled gates swing open on their bands
34,,"Of gold; within, a lurid shadow stands."
