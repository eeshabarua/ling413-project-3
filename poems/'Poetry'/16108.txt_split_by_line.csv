101,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.
102,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,
103,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"The Mission floor was with weeds o'ergrown,"
104,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,And crumbling and shaky its walls of stone;
105,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Its roof of tiles, in tiers and tiers,"
106,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Had stood the storms of a hundred years.
107,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"An olden, weird, medieval style"
108,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Clung to the mouldering, gloomy pile,"
109,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,And the rhythmic voice of the breaking waves
110,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Sang a lonesome dirge in its land of graves.
111,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,As I walked in the Mission old and gray--
112,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,The Mission Carmel at Monterey.
113,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,
114,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"An ancient owl went fluttering by,"
115,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Scared from his haunt. His mournful cry
116,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Wakened the echoes, till roof and wall"
117,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Caught and re-echoed the dismal call
118,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Again and again, till it seemed to me"
119,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Some Jesuit soul, in mockery--"
120,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Stripped of rosary, gown, and cowl--"
121,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Haunted the place, in this dreary owl."
122,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Surely I shivered with fright that day,"
123,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Alone in the Mission, old and gray--"
124,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,The Mission Carmel at Monterey.
125,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,
126,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,
127,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Near the chapel vault was a dungeon grim,"
128,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,And they say that many a chanted hymn
129,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Has rung a knell on the moldy air
130,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"For luckless errant prisoned there,"
131,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,As kneeling monk and pious nun
132,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Sang orison at set of sun.
133,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"A single window, dark and small,"
134,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Showed opening in the heavy wall,"
135,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Nor other entrance seemed attained
136,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,That erst had human footstep gained.
137,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,I paused before the uncanny place
138,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,And peered me into its darksome space.
139,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Had it of secret aught to tell,"
140,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,That locked up darkness kept it well.
141,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"I turned, and lo! by my side there stood"
142,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,A being of strangest naturehood.
143,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Startled, I glanced him o'er and o'er,"
144,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Wondering I noted him not before.
145,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"His form was stooped with the weight of years,"
146,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,And on his cheek was a trace of tears;
147,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Over all his face a shade of pain
148,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"That deepened and vanished, and came again."
149,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Fixed he his woeful eyes on me--
150,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Through my very soul they seemed to see.
151,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,And lightly he laid his hand on mine--
152,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,His hand was cold as the vestal shrine.
153,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"""'Tis haunted,"" he said, ""haunted, and he"
154,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Who dares at night-noon go with me
155,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"To this cursed place, by phantoms trod,"
156,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Must fear not devil, man, nor God."""
157,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"""Tell me the story,"" I cried, ""tell me!"""
158,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,And frightened was I at my bravery.
159,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"A curious smile his thin lips curved,"
160,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,That well had my bravery unnerved.
161,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,And this is the story he told that day
162,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,To me in the Mission old and gray--
163,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,The Mission Carmel at Monterey.
164,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,
165,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"""Each midnight, since have seventy years"
166,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Begun their cycle around the spheres,"
167,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Two faces have looked from that window there.
168,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"One is a woman's, young and fair,"
169,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,With tender eyes and floating hair.
170,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Love, and regret, and dumb despair,"
171,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Are told in each tint of the fair sweet face.
172,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"The other is crowned with a courtly grace,"
173,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Gazing, with all a lover's pride,"
174,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,On the beautiful woman by his side.
175,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Anon! a change flits o'er his mien,"
176,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,And baffled rage in his glance is seen.
177,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Paler they grow as the hours go by,"
178,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,With the pallor that comes with the summons to die.
179,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Slowly fading, and shrinking away,"
180,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Clutched in the grasp of a gaunt decay,"
181,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Till the herald of morn on the sky is thrown;
182,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Then a shriek, a curse, and a dying moan,"
183,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Comes from that death-black window there.
184,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"A mocking laugh rings out on the air,"
185,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"From that darkful place, in the nascent dawn,"
186,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,And the faces that looked from the window are gone.
187,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Seventy years, when the Spanish flag"
188,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Floated above yon beetling crag,"
189,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,And this dearthful mission place was rife
190,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,With the panoply of busy life;
191,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Hard by, where yon canyon, deep and wide,"
192,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Sweeps it adown the mountain side,"
193,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,A cavalier dwelt with his beautiful bride.
194,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Oft to the priestal shrive went she;
195,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"As often, stealthily, followed he."
196,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,The padre Sanson absolved and blessed
197,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"The penitent, and the sin-distressed,"
198,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Nor ever before won devotee
199,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,So wondrous a reverence as he.
200,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"A-night, when the winds played wild and high,"
201,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"And the ocean rocked it to the sky,"
202,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"An earthquake trembled the shore along,"
203,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Hushing on lip of praise its song,"
204,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,And jarred to its center this Mission strong.
205,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"When the morning broke with a summer sun,"
206,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"The earth was at rest, the storm was done."
207,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Still the Mission tower'd in its stately pride;
208,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Still the cottage smiled by the canyon-side;
209,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"But never the priest was there to bless,"
210,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,And the cottage roof was tenantless.
211,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Vainly they sought for the padre, dead,"
212,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"For the cottage dwellers; amazed, they said"
213,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,'Twas a miracle; but since that day
214,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,There's a ghost in the Mission old and gray--
215,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,The Mission Carmel of Monterey
216,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,
217,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"""A sequel there is to that tale,"" said he,"
218,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"""Of the way and the truth I hold the key."""
219,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"""Show me the way,"" I cried, ""Show me"
220,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"To the depth of this curious mystery!"""
221,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,He waved me to follow; my heart stood still
222,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Under the ban of a mightier will
223,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Than mine. A terror of icy chill
224,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"O'er-shivered my being from hand to brain,"
225,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Freezing the blood in each pulsing vein,"
226,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,As I followed  this most mysterious guide
227,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Through the solid floor at the chancel side,"
228,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Into a passage whose stifling breath
229,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Reeked with the pestilence of death.
230,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Down through a subterranean vault,"
231,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Over broken steps with never a halt,"
232,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Till we stood in the midst of a spacious room,"
233,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,A charnel-house in its shroud of gloom.
234,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Only a window, narrow and small,"
235,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Left in the build of the heavy wall,"
236,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Through which the flickering sunbeams died,"
237,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Showed passway to the world outside.
238,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Slowly my eyes to the darkness grew,"
239,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"And I saw in the gloom, or rather knew,"
240,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"That my feet had touched two skeleton forms,"
241,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,One closely clasped in the other's arms.
242,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Recoiling, I shuddered and turned my face"
243,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,From the fleshless mockery of embrace.
244,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Again o'er a heap of rubbish and rust,"
245,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,I stumbled and caught in the moth and dust
246,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,What hardly a sense of my soul believes--
247,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,A mold-stained package of parchment leaves!
248,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,A hideous bat flapped into my face!
249,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"O'ercome with horror, I fled the place,"
250,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,And stood again with my curious guide
251,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"On the solid floor, at the chancel's side."
252,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"But, lo! in a moment the age-bowed seer"
253,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Was a darkly frowning cavalier,"
254,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Gazing no longer in woeful trance,"
255,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Vengeance blazed in his every glance.
256,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Then a mocking laugh rang the Mission o'er,"
257,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,And I stood alone by the chapel door;
258,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"And, save for the mold-stained parchment leaves,"
259,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,I had thought it the vision that night-mare weaves.
260,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Hardly a sense of my soul believes,"
261,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,Yet I held in my hand the parchment leaves.
262,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Careful I noted them, one by one,"
263,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Each was a letter in rhyming run,"
264,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"Written over and over, in tenderest strain,"
265,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,By fingers that never will write again.
266,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"I strung them together, a tale to tell,"
267,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"And named it ""The Mystery of Carmel."""
268,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"And these are the letters I found that day,"
269,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,"In the mission ruin, old and gray--"

274,MYSTERY OF CARMEL.,
275,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON
276,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,
277,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,"Oh, holy father, list thee to my prayer!"
278,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,"I may not kneel to thee as others kneel,"
279,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,"And tell my heart-aches with the suppliant's air,"
280,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,But fiercer burns the fire I must conceal.
281,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,
282,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,"My soul is groping in the mists of doubt,"
283,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,"The sunlight and the shadows all are gone,"
284,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,"Only a cold, gray cloud my life's about,"
285,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,Nor ever vision of a fairer dawn.
286,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,
287,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,"A father ne'er my brow in loving smoothed,"
288,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,Nor taught my baby tongue to lisp his name;
289,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,"No mother's voice my childish sorrows soothed,"
290,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,"Nor sought my wild, imperious will to tame."
291,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,
292,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,"Yet ran my life, like some bright bubbling spring,"
293,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,Too full of thoughtless happiness to care
294,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,"If that the future might more gladness bring,"
295,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,Or might its skies be clouded or be fair.
296,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,
297,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,Afar upon the purple hills of Spain--
298,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,Since waned the moons of half a year ago--
299,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,"I sported, reckless as the laughing main,"
300,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,Nor dreamed in life a thought of grief to know.
301,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,
302,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,To-day I pine here in a chain whose gall
303,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,Is bitterer than drop of wormwood brought
304,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,"From that salt sea where nothing lives, and all"
305,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,The recompense my willfulness has brought.
306,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,
307,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,"Oh, holy father, list thee to my prayer!"
308,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,"And though I may not kneel as others kneel,"
309,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,"And tell my heart-aches with a suppliant air,"
310,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,I crave they grace a sickened soul to heal.
311,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,
312,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,"Here, close beside this sacred font of gold,"
313,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,"My humble prayer, oh, father, I will lay,"
314,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,With all its weight of misery untold;
315,TO THE HOLY FATHER SANSON,And wait impatient that which thou wilt say

323,TO REVENITA,"When to the font, this morn, my lips I pressed,"
324,TO REVENITA,A fairy's gift my fingers trembled o'er;
325,TO REVENITA,"A sweeter prayer ne'er smile of angel blessed,"
326,TO REVENITA,Nor gemmed a tiar that the priesthood wore.
327,TO REVENITA,
328,TO REVENITA,"The secret of they grief I may not know,"
329,TO REVENITA,Since that thy lips refuse the tale to tell;
330,TO REVENITA,"Methinks, dear child, it was the sound of woe"
331,TO REVENITA,That woke an echo in my heart's deep well.
332,TO REVENITA,
333,TO REVENITA,The wail of a spirit that a-yearning gropes
334,TO REVENITA,In darkness for the sunlight that is fled;
335,TO REVENITA,"A broken idol in secret wept, and hopes--"
336,TO REVENITA,Crushed hopes--that are to thee as are the dead.
337,TO REVENITA,
338,TO REVENITA,A tender memory ling'ring yet of when
339,TO REVENITA,Each bounding pulse beat faster with its joy;
340,TO REVENITA,"A something that allured, and won, and then"
341,TO REVENITA,"With waking fled, and years may not destroy"
342,TO REVENITA,
343,TO REVENITA,The impress which it left upon thy brain
344,TO REVENITA,"But seek thee, child, grief's ravaging to stay?"
345,TO REVENITA,"Thy tears might fall as falls the show'ring rain,"
346,TO REVENITA,They could not wash the heart's deep scars away.
347,TO REVENITA,
348,TO REVENITA,Repine thee not; shroud not they faith in gloom;
349,TO REVENITA,Shrink not to meet a disappointment's frown;
350,TO REVENITA,"Away beyond the narrow bordered tomb,"
351,TO REVENITA,Who here have borne the cross may wear the crown.

360,TO SANSON,Whisper softly in his ear
361,TO SANSON,"That some one is waiting, waiting,"
362,TO SANSON,Listening his step to hear.
363,TO SANSON,
364,TO SANSON,"Fairies, if he knew his presence"
365,TO SANSON,"Would a demon's spell allay,"
366,TO SANSON,Would he heed your timid whisperings?

378,TO REVENITA,Floating in the starry light.
379,TO REVENITA,
380,TO REVENITA,"And they tell him; yes, they tell him,"
381,TO REVENITA,"All in accents sweet and clear,"
382,TO REVENITA,Of the beautiful Hereafter
383,TO REVENITA,That is ever drawing near.
384,TO REVENITA,
385,TO REVENITA,"There are loved ones, waiting, waiting,"
386,TO REVENITA,For his footfall on the shore;
387,TO REVENITA,They will welcome his appearing--
388,TO REVENITA,They will greet him o'er and o'er.

398,TO SANSON,"Teach her a beautiful hereafter,"
399,TO SANSON,A Heaven to bless a tired heart.
400,TO SANSON,
401,TO SANSON,Yet thinks she that the dear ones waiting
402,TO SANSON,Would envy not the boon she craves--
403,TO SANSON,To rear fair friendship's sacred alter
404,TO SANSON,Where love and hope sleep in their graves.
405,TO SANSON,
406,TO SANSON,She knows not that a loving welcome
407,TO SANSON,"Will wait her in a realm of light,"
408,TO SANSON,"Nought of a future meeting whispers,"
409,TO SANSON,No faith illumes her soul's dark night.
410,TO SANSON,
411,TO SANSON,"But oh! she knows, has by experience,"
412,TO SANSON,The saddest of all lessons learned;
413,TO SANSON,"Knows that she gathered dead-sea apples,"
414,TO SANSON,Which in her hands to ashes turned.
415,TO SANSON,
416,TO SANSON,"She knows into a trammelled torrent,"
417,TO SANSON,Is changed her life's free flowing tide;
418,TO SANSON,"Knows that her hand no oar is holding,"
419,TO SANSON,With which her drifting bark to guide.
420,TO SANSON,
421,TO SANSON,"She knows, yes, knows that, like the mirage,"
422,TO SANSON,"Which for the thirsty traveler gleamed,"
423,TO SANSON,The sweet ideal she fondly cherished
424,TO SANSON,Was never there; it only seemed.
425,TO SANSON,
426,TO SANSON,If what she knows is to her proven
427,TO SANSON,"A false, deluding, fleeting show,"
428,TO SANSON,"Can she, generous spirit, can she"
429,TO SANSON,Trust blindly what she does not know?
430,TO SANSON,
431,TO SANSON,But if for this he shuts against her
432,TO SANSON,"The heart that's shining in his eyes,"
433,TO SANSON,She'll bring the gift that for the Peri
434,TO SANSON,Unbarred the gate of paradise.
