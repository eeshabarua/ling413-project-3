98,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,Prelude
99,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
100,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
101,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
102,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"_I sing no idle songs of dalliance days,"
103,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,No dreams Elysian inspire my rhyming;
104,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"I have no Celia to enchant my lays,"
105,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,No pipes of Pan have set my heart to chiming.
106,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,I am no wordsmith dripping gems divine
107,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,Into the golden chalice of a sonnet;
108,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"If love songs witch you, close this book of mine,"
109,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,Waste no time on it._
110,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
111,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"_Yet bring I to my work an eager joy,"
112,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,A lusty love of life and all things human;
113,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Still in me leaps the wonder of the boy,"
114,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"A pride in man, a deathless faith in woman."
115,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Still red blood calls, still rings the valiant fray;"
116,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,Adventure beacons through the summer gloaming:
117,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,Oh long and long and long will be the day
118,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,Ere I come homing!_
119,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
120,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"_This earth is ours to love:  lute, brush and pen,"
121,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,They are but tongues to tell of life sincerely;
122,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"The thaumaturgic Day, the might of men,"
123,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"O God of Scribes, grant us to grave them clearly!"
124,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Grant heart that homes in heart, then all is well."
125,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Honey is honey-sweet, howe'er the hiving."
126,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Each to his work, his wage at evening bell"
127,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,The strength of striving._
128,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
129,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
130,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
131,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
132,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,A Rolling Stone
133,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
134,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
135,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
136,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"_There's sunshine in the heart of me,"
137,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,My blood sings in the breeze;
138,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"The mountains are a part of me,"
139,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,I'm fellow to the trees.
140,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"My golden youth I'm squandering,"
141,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,Sun-libertine am I;
142,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"A-wandering, a-wandering,"
143,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,Until the day I die._
144,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
145,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"I was once, I declare, a Stone-Age man,"
146,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,And I roomed in the cool of a cave;
147,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"I have known, I will swear, in a new life-span,"
148,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,The fret and the sweat of a slave:
149,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"For far over all that folks hold worth,"
150,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,There lives and there leaps in me
151,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"A love of the lowly things of earth,"
152,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,And a passion to be free.
153,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
154,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"To pitch my tent with no prosy plan,"
155,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,To range and to change at will;
156,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"To mock at the mastership of man,"
157,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,To seek Adventure's thrill.
158,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Carefree to be, as a bird that sings;"
159,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,To go my own sweet way;
160,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"To reck not at all what may befall,"
161,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,But to live and to love each day.
162,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
163,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,To make my body a temple pure
164,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,Wherein I dwell serene;
165,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"To care for the things that shall endure,"
166,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"The simple, sweet and clean."
167,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"To oust out envy and hate and rage,"
168,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,To breathe with no alarm;
169,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"For Nature shall be my anchorage,"
170,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,And none shall do me harm.
171,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
172,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"To shun all lures that debauch the soul,"
173,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,The orgied rites of the rich;
174,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,To eat my crust as a rover must
175,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,With the rough-neck down in the ditch.
176,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,To trudge by his side whate'er betide;
177,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,To share his fire at night;
178,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"To call him friend to the long trail-end,"
179,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,And to read his heart aright.
180,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
181,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"To scorn all strife, and to view all life"
182,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,With the curious eyes of a child;
183,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"From the plangent sea to the prairie,"
184,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,From the slum to the heart of the Wild.
185,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"From the red-rimmed star to the speck of sand,"
186,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,From the vast to the greatly small;
187,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"For I know that the whole for good is planned,"
188,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,And I want to see it all.
189,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
190,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"To see it all, the wide world-way,"
191,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,From the fig-leaf belt to the Pole;
192,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"With never a one to say me nay,"
193,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,And none to cramp my soul.
194,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"In belly-pinch I will pay the price,"
195,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,But God! let me be free;
196,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"For once I know in the long ago,"
197,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,They made a slave of me.
198,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
199,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"In a flannel shirt from earth's clean dirt,"
200,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Here, pal, is my calloused hand!"
201,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Oh, I love each day as a rover may,"
202,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,Nor seek to understand.
203,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,To _ENJOY_ is good enough for me;
204,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,The gipsy of God am I;
205,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,Then here's a hail to each flaring dawn!
206,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,And here's a cheer to the night that's gone!
207,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,And may I go a-roaming on
208,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,Until the day I die!
209,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
210,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,_Then every star shall sing to me
211,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,Its song of liberty;
212,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,And every morn shall bring to me
213,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,Its mandate to be free.
214,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,In every throbbing vein of me
215,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,I'll feel the vast Earth-call;
216,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"O body, heart and brain of me"
217,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,Praise Him who made it all!_
218,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
219,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
220,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
221,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
222,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,The Soldier of Fortune
223,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
224,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
225,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
226,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"""Deny your God!"" they ringed me with their spears;"
227,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Blood-crazed were they, and reeking from the strife;"
228,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Hell-hot their hate, and venom-fanged their sneers,"
229,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,And one man spat on me and nursed a knife.
230,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"And there was I, sore wounded and alone,"
231,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"I, the last living of my slaughtered band."
232,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Oh sinister the sky, and cold as stone!"
233,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,In one red laugh of horror reeled the land.
234,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"And dazed and desperate I faced their spears,"
235,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"And like a flame out-leaped that naked knife,"
236,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,And like a serpent stung their bitter jeers:
237,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"""Deny your God, and we will give you life."""
238,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
239,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,Deny my God!  Oh life was very sweet!
240,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,And it is hard in youth and hope to die;
241,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"And there my comrades dear lay at my feet,"
242,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,And in that blear of blood soon must I lie.
243,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"And yet . . . I almost laughed -- it seemed so odd,"
244,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,For long and long had I not vainly tried
245,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"To reason out and body forth my God,"
246,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"And prayed for light, and doubted -- and _DENIED_:"
247,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Denied the Being I could not conceive,"
248,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,Denied a life-to-be beyond the grave. . . .
249,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"And now they ask me, who do not believe,"
250,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Just to deny, to voice my doubt, to save"
251,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"This life of mine that sings so in the sun,"
252,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"The bloom of youth yet red upon my cheek,"
253,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"My only life! -- O fools! 'tis easy done,"
254,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,I will deny . . . and yet I do not speak.
255,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
256,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"""Deny your God!"" their spears are all agleam,"
257,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,And I can see their eyes with blood-lust shine;
258,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Their snarling voices shrill into a scream,"
259,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"And, mad to slay, they quiver for the sign."
260,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Deny my God! yes, I could do it well;"
261,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Yet if I did, what of my race, my name?"
262,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"How they would spit on me, these dogs of hell!"
263,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Spurn me, and put on me the brand of shame."
264,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"A white man's honour! what of that, I say?"
265,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Shall these black curs cry ""Coward"" in my face?"
266,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,They who would perish for their gods of clay --
267,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,Shall I defile my country and my race?
268,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,My country! what's my country to me now?
269,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Soldier of Fortune, free and far I roam;"
270,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"All men are brothers in my heart, I vow;"
271,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,The wide and wondrous world is all my home.
272,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"My country! reverent of her splendid Dead,"
273,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Her heroes proud, her martyrs pierced with pain:"
274,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,For me her puissant blood was vainly shed;
275,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"For me her drums of battle beat in vain,"
276,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"And free I fare, half-heedless of her fate:"
277,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"No faith, no flag I owe -- then why not seek"
278,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,This last loop-hole of life?  Why hesitate?
279,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,I will deny . . . and yet I do not speak.
280,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
281,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"""Deny your God!"" their spears are poised on high,"
282,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,And tense and terrible they wait the word;
283,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"And dark and darker glooms the dreary sky,"
284,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,And in that hush of horror no thing stirred.
285,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Then, through the ringing terror and sheer hate"
286,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Leaped there a vision to me -- Oh, how far!"
287,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"A face, Her face . . . through all my stormy fate"
288,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"A joy, a strength, a glory and a star."
289,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Beneath the pines, where lonely camp-fires gleam,"
290,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"In seas forlorn, amid the deserts drear,"
291,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,How I had gladdened to that face of dream!
292,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"And never, never had it seemed so dear."
293,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,O silken hair that veils the sunny brow!
294,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"O eyes of grey, so tender and so true!"
295,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,O lips of smiling sweetness! must I now
296,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,For ever and for ever go from you?
297,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Ah, yes, I must . . . for if I do this thing,"
298,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,How can I look into your face again?
299,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Knowing you think me more than half a king,"
300,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"I with my craven heart, my honour slain."
301,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
302,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"No! no! my mind's made up.  I gaze above,"
303,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,Into that sky insensate as a stone;
304,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Not for my creed, my country, but my Love"
305,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,Will I stand up and meet my death alone.
306,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Then though it be to utter dark I sink,"
307,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,The God that dwells in me is not denied;
308,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"""Best"" triumphs over ""Beast"", -- and so I think"
309,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,Humanity itself is glorified. . . .
310,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
311,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"""And now, my butchers, I embrace my fate."
312,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,Come! let my heart's blood slake the thirsty sod.
313,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,Curst be the life you offer!  Glut your hate!
314,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Strike!  Strike, you dogs!  I'll _NOT_ deny my God."""
315,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
316,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"I saw the spears that seemed a-leap to slay,"
317,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,All quiver earthward at the headman's nod;
318,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,And in a daze of dream I heard him say:
319,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"""Go, set him free who serves so well his God!"""
320,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
321,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
322,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
323,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
324,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,The Gramaphone at Fond-Du-Lac
325,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
326,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
327,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
328,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,Now Eddie Malone got a swell grammyfone to draw all the trade to his store;
329,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"An' sez he:  ""Come along for a season of song,"
330,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"which the like ye had niver before."""
331,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Then Dogrib, an' Slave, an' Yellow-knife brave, an' Cree in his dinky canoe,"
332,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Confluated near, to see an' to hear Ed's grammyfone make its dayboo."
333,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
334,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Then Ed turned the crank, an' there on the bank"
335,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,they squatted like bumps on a log.
336,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"For acres around there wasn't a sound, not even the howl of a dog."
337,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,When out of the horn there sudden was born such a marvellous elegant tone;
338,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,An' then like a spell on that auddyence fell
339,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,the voice of its first grammyfone.
340,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
341,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"""_BAD MEDICINE!_"" cried Old Tom, the One-eyed,"
342,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,an' made for to jump in the lake;
343,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"But no one gave heed to his little stampede,"
344,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,so he guessed he had made a mistake.
345,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Then Roll-in-the-Mud, a chief of the blood, observed in choice Chippewayan:"
346,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"""You've brought us canned beef, an' it's now my belief"
347,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"that this here's a case of '_CANNED MAN'_."""
348,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,
349,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"Well, though I'm not strong on the Dago in song,"
350,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,that sure got me goin' for fair.
351,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"There was Crusoe an' Scotty, an' Ma'am Shoeman Hank,"
352,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,an' Melber an' Bonchy was there.
353,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"'Twas silver an' gold, an' sweetness untold"
354,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,to hear all them big guinneys sing;
355,RHYMES OF A ROLLING STONE,"An' thick all around an' inhalin' the sound, them Indians formed in a ring."

785,XV,"And there we hung, and there we clung, with beef and brawn and thew,"
786,XV,"And sinews cracked and joints were racked, and panting came our breath;"
787,XV,"And there we swayed and there we prayed, till strength and hope were spent --"
788,XV,"Then Dick, he threw us off like rats, and after Jim he went."
789,XV,
790,XV,"With mighty urge amid the surge of river-rage he leapt,"
791,XV,And gripped his mate and desperate he fought to gain the shore;
792,XV,"With teeth a-gleam he bucked the stream, yet swift and sure he swept"
793,XV,To meet the mighty cataract that waited all a-roar.
794,XV,"And there we stood like carven wood, our faces sickly white,"
795,XV,"And watched him as he beat the foam, and inch by inch he lost;"
796,XV,"And nearer, nearer drew the fall, and fiercer grew the fight,"
797,XV,Till on the very cascade crest a last farewell he tossed.
798,XV,Then down and down and down they plunged into that pit of dread;
799,XV,And mad we tore along the shore to claim our bitter dead.
800,XV,
801,XV,"And from that hell of frenzied foam, that crashed and fumed and boiled,"
802,XV,"Two little bodies bubbled up, and they were heedless then;"
803,XV,"And oh, they lay like senseless clay! and bitter hard we toiled,"
804,XV,"Yet never, never gleam of hope, and we were weary men."
805,XV,"And moments mounted into hours, and black was our despair;"
806,XV,"And faint were we, and we were fain to give them up as dead,"
807,XV,"When suddenly I thrilled with hope:  ""Back, boys! and give him air;"
808,XV,"I feel the flutter of his heart. . . .""  And, as the word I said,"
809,XV,"Dick gave a sigh, and gazed around, and saw our breathless band;"
810,XV,"And saw the sky's blue floor above, all strewn with golden fleece;"
811,XV,"And saw his comrade Jack-pot Jim, and touched him with his hand:"
812,XV,And then there came into his eyes a look of perfect peace.
813,XV,"And as there, at his very feet, the thwarted river raved,"
814,XV,I heard him murmur low and deep:

834,XV,My Kingdom's awaiting for me;
835,XV,"There's comfort and rest, and the warmth of your breast,"

867,XV,
868,XV,She sat there in the shining room;

870,XV,He stared and stared from out the gloom;

873,XV,Her roses rustled overhead.
874,XV,"She saw, with sudden start."

1256,II,"We've got to make Fort Liard quick.  I know the river's bad,"
1257,II,"But, oh! the little woman's sick . . . why! don't you savvy, lad?"""
1258,II,"And me!  Well, yes, I must confess it wasn't hard to see"
1259,II,Their little family group of two would soon be one of three.
1260,II,"And so I answered, careless-like:  ""Why, Bill! you don't suppose"
1261,II,"I'm scared of that there 'babbling brook'?  Whatever you say -- goes."""
1262,II,
1263,II,"A real live man was Barb-wire Bill, with insides copper-lined;"
1264,II,"For ""barb-wire"" was the brand of ""hooch"" to which he most inclined."
1265,II,They knew him far; his igloos are on Kittiegazuit strand.
1266,II,"They knew him well, the tribes who dwell within the Barren Land."
1267,II,From Koyokuk to Kuskoquim his fame was everywhere;
1268,II,"And he did love, all life above, that little Julie Claire,"
1269,II,"The lithe, white slave-girl he had bought for seven hundred skins,"
1270,II,And taken to his wickiup to make his moccasins.
1271,II,
1272,II,"We crawled down to the river bank and feeble folk were we,"
1273,II,"That Julie Claire from God-knows-where, and Barb-wire Bill and me."
1274,II,"From shore to shore we heard the roar the heaving ice-floes make,"
1275,II,"And loud we laughed, and launched our raft, and followed in their wake."
1276,II,"The river swept and seethed and leapt, and caught us in its stride;"
1277,II,And on we hurled amid a world that crashed on every side.
1278,II,With sullen din the banks caved in; the shore-ice lanced the stream;
1279,II,"The naked floes like spooks arose, all jiggling and agleam."
1280,II,"Black anchor-ice of strange device shot upward from its bed,"
1281,II,"As night and day we cleft our way, and arrow-like we sped."
1282,II,
1283,II,"But ""Faster still!"" cried Barb-wire Bill, and looked the live-long day"
1284,II,"In dull despair at Julie Claire, as white like death she lay."
1285,II,"And sometimes he would seem to pray and sometimes seem to curse,"
1286,II,"And bent above, with eyes of love, yet ever she grew worse."
1287,II,"And as we plunged and leapt and lunged, her face was plucked with pain,"
1288,II,And I could feel his nerves of steel a-quiver at the strain.
1289,II,And in the night he gripped me tight as I lay fast asleep:
1290,II,"""The river's kicking like a steer . . . run out the forward sweep!"
1291,II,"That's Hell-gate Canyon right ahead; I know of old its roar,"
1292,II,"And . . . I'll be damned! _THE ICE IS JAMMED!_  We've _GOT_ to make the shore."""
1293,II,
1294,II,With one wild leap I gripped the sweep.  The night was black as sin.
1295,II,"The float-ice crashed and ripped and smashed, and stunned us with its din."
1296,II,"And near and near, and clear and clear I heard the canyon boom;"
1297,II,And swift and strong we swept along to meet our awful doom.
1298,II,"And as with dread I glimpsed ahead the death that waited there,"
1299,II,"My only thought was of the girl, the little Julie Claire;"
1300,II,"And so, like demon mad with fear, I panted at the oar,"
1301,II,"And foot by foot, and inch by inch, we worked the raft ashore."
1302,II,
1303,II,"The bank was staked with grinding ice, and as we scraped and crashed,"
1304,II,"I only knew one thing to do, and through my mind it flashed:"
1305,II,"Yet while I groped to find the rope, I heard Bill's savage cry:"
1306,II,"""That's my job, lad!  It's me that jumps.  I'll snub this raft or die!"""
1307,II,"I saw him leap, I saw him creep, I saw him gain the land;"
1308,II,"I saw him crawl, I saw him fall, then run with rope in hand."
1309,II,"And then the darkness gulped him up, and down we dashed once more,"
1310,II,"And nearer, nearer drew the jam, and thunder-like its roar."
1311,II,
1312,II,"Oh God! all's lost . . . from Julie Claire there came a wail of pain,"
1313,II,"And then -- the rope grew sudden taut, and quivered at the strain;"
1314,II,"It slacked and slipped, it whined and gripped, and oh, I held my breath!"
1315,II,And there we hung and there we swung right in the jaws of death.
1316,II,
1317,II,"A little strand of hempen rope, and how I watched it there,"
1318,II,"With all around a hell of sound, and darkness and despair;"
1319,II,"A little strand of hempen rope, I watched it all alone,"
1320,II,And somewhere in the dark behind I heard a woman moan;
1321,II,"And somewhere in the dark ahead I heard a man cry out,"
1322,II,"Then silence, silence, silence fell, and mocked my hollow shout."
1323,II,"And yet once more from out the shore I heard that cry of pain,"
1324,II,"A moan of mortal agony, then all was still again."
1325,II,
1326,II,"That night was hell with all the frills, and when the dawn broke dim,"
1327,II,"I saw a lean and level land, but never sign of him."
1328,II,"I saw a flat and frozen shore of hideous device,"
1329,II,I saw a long-drawn strand of rope that vanished through the ice.
1330,II,"And on that treeless, rockless shore I found my partner -- dead."
1331,II,"No place was there to snub the raft, so -- _HE HAD SERVED INSTEAD_;"
1332,II,"And with the rope lashed round his waist, in last defiant fight,"
1333,II,"He'd thrown himself beneath the ice, that closed and gripped him tight;"
1334,II,"And there he'd held us back from death, as fast in death he lay. . . ."
1335,II,"Say, boys!  I'm not the pious brand, but -- I just tried to pray."
1336,II,"And then I looked to Julie Claire, and sore abashed was I,"
1337,II,"For from the robes that covered her, _I -- HEARD -- A -- BABY -- CRY_. . . ."
1338,II,
1339,II,"Thus was Love conqueror of death, and life for life was given;"
1340,II,"And though no saint on earth, d'ye think --"

1354,II,"And yet in the past (I grieve to state),"
1355,II,"She never had been exactly ""straight""."

1402,II,With God's sunshine was that boy;
1403,II,Had a strangle-holt on Joy.
1404,II,"Held his head 'way up in air,"
1405,II,Left no callin' cards on Care;
1406,II,"Breezy, buoyant, brave and true;"
1407,II,Sent his sunshine out to you;
1408,II,Cheerfulest when clouds was black --
1409,II,"Happy Jack!  Oh, Happy Jack!"
1410,II,
1411,II,Sittin' in my shack alone
1412,II,"I could hear him in his own,"
1413,II,"Singin' far into the night,"
1414,II,Till it didn't seem just right
1415,II,"One man should corral the fun,"
1416,II,Live his life so in the sun;
1417,II,Didn't seem quite natural
1418,II,Not to have a grouch at all;
1419,II,"Not a trouble, not a lack --"
1420,II,"Happy Jack!  Oh, Happy Jack!"
1421,II,
1422,II,He was plumbful of good cheer
1423,II,Till he struck that low-down year;
1424,II,"Got so thin, so little to him,"
1425,II,You could most see day-light through him.
1426,II,"Never was his eye so bright,"
1427,II,Never was his cheek so white.
1428,II,"Seemed as if somethin' was wrong,"
1429,II,Sort o' quaver in his song.
1430,II,"Same old smile, same hearty voice:"
1431,II,"""Bless you, boys! let's all rejoice!"""
1432,II,But old Doctor shook his head:
1433,II,"""Half a lung,"" was all he said."

1436,II,"Singin', singin' in his shack --"
1437,II,"Happy Jack!  Oh, Happy Jack!"
1438,II,
1439,II,Then one day a letter came
1440,II,Endin' with a female name;
1441,II,"Seemed to get him in the neck,"
1442,II,Sort o' pile-driver effect;
1443,II,"Paled his lip and plucked his breath,"
1444,II,Left him starin' still as death.
1445,II,"Somethin' had gone awful wrong,"
1446,II,Yet that night he sang his song.
1447,II,"Oh, but it was good to hear!"
1448,II,"For there clutched my heart a fear,"
1449,II,So that I quaked listenin'
1450,II,Every night to hear him sing.
1451,II,"But each day he laughed with me,"
1452,II,An' his smile was full of glee.
1453,II,Nothin' seemed to set him back --
1454,II,"Happy Jack!  Oh, Happy Jack!"
1455,II,
1456,II,Then one night the singin' stopped . . .
1457,II,Seemed as if my heart just flopped;
1458,II,For I'd learned to love the boy
1459,II,"With his gilt-edged line of joy,"
1460,II,"With his glorious gift of bluff,"
1461,II,With his splendid fightin' stuff.
1462,II,"Sing on, lad, and play the game!"
1463,II,"O dear God! . . . no singin' came,"
1464,II,But there surged to me instead --
1465,II,"Silence, silence, deep and dread;"
1466,II,"Till I shuddered, tried to pray,"
1467,II,"Said:  ""He's maybe gone away."""
1468,II,
1469,II,"Oh, yes, he had gone away,"
1470,II,Gone forever and a day.
1471,II,"But he'd left behind him there,"
1472,II,"In his cabin, pinched and bare,"
1473,II,"His poor body, skin and bone,"
1474,II,"His sharp face, cold as a stone."
1475,II,An' his stiffened fingers pressed
1476,II,Somethin' bright upon his breast:
1477,II,"Locket with a silken curl,"
1478,II,"Poor, sweet portrait of a girl."
1479,II,Yet I reckon at the last
1480,II,How defiant-like he passed;
1481,II,For there sat upon his lips
1482,II,Smile that death could not eclipse;
1483,II,An' within his eyes lived still
1484,II,Joy that dyin' could not kill.
1485,II,
1486,II,"An' now when the nights are long,"

2925,I,"Heed me, feed me, I am hungry, I am red-tongued with desire;"
2926,I,"Boughs of balsam, slabs of cedar, gummy fagots of the pine,"
2927,I,"Heap them on me, let me hug them to my eager heart of fire,"
2928,I,"Roaring, soaring up to heaven as a symbol and a sign."
2929,I,"Bring me knots of sunny maple, silver birch and tamarack;"
2930,I,"Leaping, sweeping, I will lap them with my ardent wings of flame;"
2931,I,"I will kindle them to glory, I will beat the darkness back;"
2932,I,"Streaming, gleaming, I will goad them to my glory and my fame."
2933,I,"Bring me gnarly limbs of live-oak, aid me in my frenzied fight;"
2934,I,"Strips of iron-wood, scaly blue-gum, writhing redly in my hold;"
2935,I,"With my lunge of lurid lances, with my whips that flail the night,"
2936,I,"They will burgeon into beauty, they will foliate in gold."
2937,I,"Let me star the dim sierras, stab with light the inland seas;"
2938,I,Roaming wind and roaring darkness! seek no mercy at my hands;
2939,I,"I will mock the marly heavens, lamp the purple prairies,"
2940,I,"I will flaunt my deathless banners down the far, unhouseled lands."
2941,I,"In the vast and vaulted pine-gloom where the pillared forests frown,"
2942,I,"By the sullen, bestial rivers running where God only knows,"
2943,I,"On the starlit coral beaches when the combers thunder down,"
2944,I,"In the death-spell of the barrens, in the shudder of the snows;"
2945,I,"In a blazing belt of triumph from the palm-leaf to the pine,"

2968,II,
2969,II,"For you seek the silent spaces, and their secret lore you glean:"
2970,II,"For you win the savage races, and the brutish Wild you wean;"

2976,II,
2977,II,On the roaring Arkilinik in a leaky bark canoe;

2980,II,
2981,II,Now a smudge of wiry willows on the weary Kuskoquim;

2992,II,
2993,II,"Men, my masters! men, my lovers! ye have fought and ye have bled;"

3003,III,The stealthy silver moccasins of morn.
3004,III,"There comes a countless army, it's the Legion of the Light;"
3005,III,It tramps in gleaming triumph round the world;
3006,III,And before its jewelled lances all the shadows of the night
3007,III,Back in to abysmal darknesses are hurled.
3008,III,
3009,III,"Leap to life again, my lovers! ye must toil and never tire;"
3010,III,"The day of daring, doing, brightens clear,"
3011,III,When the bed of spicy cedar and the jovial camp-fire
3012,III,Must only be a memory of cheer.
3013,III,There is hope and golden promise in the vast portentous dawn;
3014,III,"There is glamour in the glad, effluent sky:"
3015,III,Go and leave me; I will dream of you and love you when you're gone;
3016,III,"I have served you, O my masters! let me die."
3017,III,
3018,III,"A little heap of ashes, grey and sodden by the rain,"
3019,III,"Wind-scattered, blurred and blotted by the snow:"
3020,III,"Let that be all to tell of me, and glorious again,"
3021,III,"Ye things of greening gladness, leap and glow!"
3022,III,"A black scar in the sunshine by the palm-leaf or the pine,"
3023,III,Blind to the night and dead to all desire;
3024,III,"Yet oh, of life and uplift what a symbol and a sign!"
3025,III,"Yet oh, of power and conquest what a destiny is mine!"
3026,III,"A little heap of ashes -- Yea! a miracle divine,"
3027,III,"The foot-print of a god, all-radiant Fire."

3036,III,"""I'm taking pen in hand this night, and hard it is for me;"
3037,III,"My poor old fingers tremble so, my hand is stiff and slow,"
3038,III,And even with my glasses on I'm troubled sore to see. . . .
3039,III,"You'd little know your mother, boy; you'd little, little know."
3040,III,"You mind how brisk and bright I was, how straight and trim and smart;"
3041,III,"'Tis weariful I am the now, and bent and frail and grey."
3042,III,"I'm waiting at the road's end, lad; and all that's in my heart,"
3043,III,"Is just to see my boy again before I'm called away."""
3044,III,
3045,III,"""Oh well I mind the sorry day you crossed the gurly sea;"
3046,III,"'Twas like the heart was torn from me, a waeful wife was I."
3047,III,"You said that you'd be home again in two years, maybe three;"
3048,III,"But nigh a score of years have gone, and still the years go by."
3049,III,"I know it's cruel hard for you, you've bairnies of your own;"
3050,III,"I know the siller's hard to win, and folks have used you ill:"
3051,III,"But oh, think of your mother, lad, that's waiting by her lone!"
3052,III,"And even if you canna come -- _JUST WRITE AND SAY YOU WILL_."""
3053,III,
3054,III,"""Aye, even though there's little hope, just promise that you'll try."
3055,III,"It's weary, weary waiting, lad; just say you'll come next year."
3056,III,I'm thinking there will be no 'next'; I'm thinking soon I'll lie
3057,III,"With all the ones I've laid away . . . but oh, the hope will cheer!"
3058,III,"You know you're all that's left to me, and we are seas apart;"
3059,III,"But if you'll only _SAY_ you'll come, then will I hope and pray."
3060,III,"I'm waiting by the grave-side, lad; and all that's in my heart"

3067,III,
3068,III,
3069,III,
3070,III,"The Dreamer visioned Life as it might be,"
3071,III,"And from his dream forthright a picture grew,"
3072,III,"A painting all the people thronged to see,"
3073,III,"And joyed therein -- till came the Man Who Knew,"
3074,III,"Saying:  ""'Tis bad!  Why do ye gape, ye fools!"
3075,III,"He painteth not according to the schools."""
3076,III,
3077,III,"The Dreamer probed Life's mystery of woe,"
3078,III,And in a book he sought to give the clue;
3079,III,"The people read, and saw that it was so,"
3080,III,"And read again -- then came the Man Who Knew,"
3081,III,"Saying:  ""Ye witless ones! this book is vile:"
3082,III,"It hath not got the rudiments of style."""
3083,III,
3084,III,"Love smote the Dreamer's lips, and silver clear"
3085,III,"He sang a song so sweet, so tender true,"
3086,III,"That all the market-place was thrilled to hear,"
3087,III,"And listened rapt -- till came the Man Who Knew,"
3088,III,"Saying:  ""His technique's wrong; he singeth ill."
3089,III,"Waste not your time.""  The singer's voice was still."
3090,III,
3091,III,"And then the people roused as if from sleep,"
3092,III,"Crying:  ""What care we if it be not Art!"
3093,III,"Hath he not charmed us, made us laugh and weep?"
3094,III,"Come, let us crown him where he sits apart."""
3095,III,"Then, with his picture spurned, his book unread,"
3096,III,"His song unsung, they found their Dreamer -- _DEAD_."

3102,III,
3103,III,
3104,III,
3105,III,"In the moonless, misty night, with my little pipe alight,"
3106,III,I am sitting by the camp-fire's fading cheer;
3107,III,"Oh, the dew is falling chill on the dim, deer-haunted hill,"
3108,III,And the breakers in the bay are moaning drear.
3109,III,"The toilful hours are sped, the boys are long abed,"
3110,III,And I alone a weary vigil keep;
3111,III,"In the sightless, sullen sky I can hear the night-hawk cry,"
3112,III,And the frogs in frenzied chorus from the creek.
3113,III,
3114,III,"And somehow the embers' glow brings me back the long ago,"
3115,III,The days of merry laughter and light song;
3116,III,When I sped the hours away with the gayest of the gay
3117,III,In the giddy whirl of fashion's festal throng.
3118,III,"Oh, I ran a grilling race and I little recked the pace,"
3119,III,For the lust of youth ran riot in my blood;
3120,III,But at last I made a stand in this God-forsaken land
3121,III,Of the pine-tree and the mountain and the flood.
3122,III,
3123,III,"And now I've got to stay, with an overdraft to pay,"
3124,III,For pleasure in the past with future pain;
3125,III,"And I'm not the chap to whine, for if the chance were mine"
3126,III,I know I'd choose the old life once again.
3127,III,"With its woman's eyes a-shine, and its flood of golden wine;"
3128,III,Its fever and its frolic and its fun;
3129,III,"The old life with its din, its laughter and its sin --"
3130,III,And chuck me in the gutter when it's done.
3131,III,
3132,III,"Ah, well! it's past and gone, and the memory is wan,"
3133,III,That conjures up each old familiar face;
3134,III,"And here by fortune hurled, I am dead to all the world,"
3135,III,And I've learned to lose my pride and keep my place.
3136,III,"My ways are hard and rough, and my arms are strong and tough,"
3137,III,And I hew the dizzy pine till darkness falls;
3138,III,"And sometimes I take a dive, just to keep my heart alive,"
3139,III,Among the gay saloons and dancing halls.
3140,III,
3141,III,"In the distant, dinful town just a little drink to drown"
3142,III,The cares that crowd and canker in my brain;
3143,III,"Just a little joy to still set my pulses all a-thrill,"
3144,III,Then back to brutish labour once again.
3145,III,And things will go on so until one day I shall know
3146,III,That Death has got me cinched beyond a doubt;
3147,III,"Then I'll crawl away from sight, and morosely in the night"
3148,III,"My weary, wasted life will peter out."
3149,III,
3150,III,"Then the boys will gather round, and they'll launch me in the ground,"
3151,III,And pile the stones the timber wolf to foil;
3152,III,"And the moaning pine will wave overhead a nameless grave,"
3153,III,Where the black snake in the sunshine loves to coil.
3154,III,"And they'll leave me there alone, and perhaps with softened tone"
3155,III,"Speak of me sometimes in the camp-fire's glow,"
3156,III,"As a played-out, broken chum, who has gone to Kingdom Come,"
3157,III,And who went the pace in England long ago.

3167,III,My den is all a cosy glow;
3168,III,"And snug before the fire I sit,"
3169,III,And wait to _FEEL_ the old year go.
3170,III,I dedicate to solemn thought
3171,III,"Amid my too-unthinking days,"
3172,III,"This sober moment, sadly fraught"
3173,III,"With much of blame, with little praise."
3174,III,
3175,III,Old Year! upon the Stage of Time
3176,III,You stand to bow your last adieu;
3177,III,"A moment, and the prompter's chime"
3178,III,Will ring the curtain down on you.
3179,III,"Your mien is sad, your step is slow;"
3180,III,You falter as a Sage in pain;
3181,III,"Yet turn, Old Year, before you go,"
3182,III,And face your audience again.
3183,III,
3184,III,"That sphinx-like face, remote, austere,"
3185,III,"Let us all read, whate'er the cost:"
3186,III,O Maiden! why that bitter tear?
3187,III,Is it for dear one you have lost?
3188,III,Is it for fond illusion gone?
3189,III,For trusted lover proved untrue?
3190,III,"O sweet girl-face, so sad, so wan"
3191,III,What hath the Old Year meant to you?
3192,III,
3193,III,"And you, O neighbour on my right"
3194,III,"So sleek, so prosperously clad!"
3195,III,What see you in that aged wight
3196,III,That makes your smile so gay and glad?
3197,III,What opportunity unmissed?
3198,III,"What golden gain, what pride of place?"
3199,III,What splendid hope?  O Optimist!
3200,III,What read you in that withered face?
3201,III,
3202,III,"And You, deep shrinking in the gloom,"
3203,III,What find you in that filmy gaze?
3204,III,What menace of a tragic doom?
3205,III,"What dark, condemning yesterdays?"
3206,III,"What urge to crime, what evil done?"
3207,III,"What cold, confronting shape of fear?"
