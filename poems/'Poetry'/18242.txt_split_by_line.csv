77,M·DCCC·XC·V,_Behind the Arras_
78,M·DCCC·XC·V,
79,M·DCCC·XC·V,
80,M·DCCC·XC·V,"I like the old house tolerably well,"
81,M·DCCC·XC·V,Where I must dwell
82,M·DCCC·XC·V,Like a familiar gnome;
83,M·DCCC·XC·V,And yet I never shall feel quite at home:
84,M·DCCC·XC·V,I love to roam.
85,M·DCCC·XC·V,
86,M·DCCC·XC·V,Day after day I loiter and explore
87,M·DCCC·XC·V,From door to door;
88,M·DCCC·XC·V,So many treasures lure
89,M·DCCC·XC·V,The curious mind. What histories obscure
90,M·DCCC·XC·V,They must immure!
91,M·DCCC·XC·V,
92,M·DCCC·XC·V,I hardly know which room I care for best;
93,M·DCCC·XC·V,"This fronting west,"
94,M·DCCC·XC·V,"With the strange hills in view,"
95,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Where the great sun goes,--where I may go too,"
96,M·DCCC·XC·V,"When my lease is through,--"
97,M·DCCC·XC·V,
98,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Or this one for the morning and the east,"
99,M·DCCC·XC·V,Where a man may feast
100,M·DCCC·XC·V,"His eyes on looming sails,"
101,M·DCCC·XC·V,And be the first to catch their foreign hails
102,M·DCCC·XC·V,Or spy their bales.
103,M·DCCC·XC·V,
104,M·DCCC·XC·V,Then the pale summer twilights towards the pole!
105,M·DCCC·XC·V,It thrills my soul
106,M·DCCC·XC·V,"With wonder and delight,"
107,M·DCCC·XC·V,"When gold-green shadows walk the world at night,"
108,M·DCCC·XC·V,"So still, so bright."
109,M·DCCC·XC·V,
110,M·DCCC·XC·V,"There at the window many a time of year,"
111,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Strange faces peer,"
112,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Solemn though not unkind,"
113,M·DCCC·XC·V,Their wits in search of something left behind
114,M·DCCC·XC·V,Time out of mind;
115,M·DCCC·XC·V,
116,M·DCCC·XC·V,"As if they once had lived here, and stole back"
117,M·DCCC·XC·V,To the window crack
118,M·DCCC·XC·V,"For a peep which seems to say,"
119,M·DCCC·XC·V,"""Good fortune, brother, in your house of clay!"""
120,M·DCCC·XC·V,"And then, ""Good day!"""
121,M·DCCC·XC·V,
122,M·DCCC·XC·V,"I hear their footsteps on the gravel walk,"
123,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Their scraps of talk,"
124,M·DCCC·XC·V,"And hurrying after, reach"
125,M·DCCC·XC·V,Only the crazy sea-drone of the beach
126,M·DCCC·XC·V,In endless speech.
127,M·DCCC·XC·V,
128,M·DCCC·XC·V,"And often when the autumn noons are still,"
129,M·DCCC·XC·V,By swale and hill
130,M·DCCC·XC·V,"I see their gipsy signs,"
131,M·DCCC·XC·V,Trespassing somewhere on my border lines;
132,M·DCCC·XC·V,With what designs?
133,M·DCCC·XC·V,
134,M·DCCC·XC·V,"I forth afoot; but when I reach the place,"
135,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Hardly a trace,"
136,M·DCCC·XC·V,Save the soft purple haze
137,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Of smouldering camp-fires, any hint betrays"
138,M·DCCC·XC·V,Who went these ways.
139,M·DCCC·XC·V,
140,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Or tatters of pale aster blue, descried"
141,M·DCCC·XC·V,"By the roadside,"
142,M·DCCC·XC·V,Reveal whither they fled;
143,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Or the swamp maples, here and there a shred"
144,M·DCCC·XC·V,Of Indian red.
145,M·DCCC·XC·V,
146,M·DCCC·XC·V,"But most of all, the marvellous tapestry"
147,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Engrosses me,"
148,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Where such strange things are rife,"
149,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Fancies of beasts and flowers, and love and strife,"
150,M·DCCC·XC·V,Woven to the life;
151,M·DCCC·XC·V,
152,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Degraded shapes and splendid seraph forms,"
153,M·DCCC·XC·V,And teeming swarms
154,M·DCCC·XC·V,Of creatures gauzy dim
155,M·DCCC·XC·V,"That cloud the dusk, and painted fish that swim,"
156,M·DCCC·XC·V,At the weaver's whim;
157,M·DCCC·XC·V,
158,M·DCCC·XC·V,And wonderful birds that wheel and hang in the air;
159,M·DCCC·XC·V,"And beings with hair,"
160,M·DCCC·XC·V,"And moving eyes in the face,"
161,M·DCCC·XC·V,"And white bone teeth and hideous grins, who race"
162,M·DCCC·XC·V,From place to place;
163,M·DCCC·XC·V,
164,M·DCCC·XC·V,"They build great temples to their John-a-nod,"
165,M·DCCC·XC·V,And fume and plod
166,M·DCCC·XC·V,"To deck themselves with gold,"
167,M·DCCC·XC·V,"And paint themselves like chattels to be sold,"
168,M·DCCC·XC·V,Then turn to mould.
169,M·DCCC·XC·V,
170,M·DCCC·XC·V,Sometimes they seem almost as real as I;
171,M·DCCC·XC·V,I hear them sigh;
172,M·DCCC·XC·V,"I see them bow with grief,"
173,M·DCCC·XC·V,Or dance for joy like an aspen leaf;
174,M·DCCC·XC·V,But that is brief.
175,M·DCCC·XC·V,
176,M·DCCC·XC·V,They have mad wars and phantom marriages;
177,M·DCCC·XC·V,Nor seem to guess
178,M·DCCC·XC·V,"There are dimensions still,"
179,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Beyond thought's reach, though not beyond love's will,"
180,M·DCCC·XC·V,For soul to fill.
181,M·DCCC·XC·V,
182,M·DCCC·XC·V,"And some I call my friends, and make believe"
183,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Their spirits grieve,"
184,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Brood, and rejoice with mine;"
185,M·DCCC·XC·V,I talk to them in phrases quaint and fine
186,M·DCCC·XC·V,Over the wine;
187,M·DCCC·XC·V,
188,M·DCCC·XC·V,I tell them all my secrets; touch their hands;
189,M·DCCC·XC·V,One understands
190,M·DCCC·XC·V,Perhaps. How hard he tries
191,M·DCCC·XC·V,"To speak! And yet those glorious mild eyes,"
192,M·DCCC·XC·V,His best replies!
193,M·DCCC·XC·V,
194,M·DCCC·XC·V,"I even have my cronies, one or two,"
195,M·DCCC·XC·V,My cherished few.
196,M·DCCC·XC·V,"But ah, they do not stay!"
197,M·DCCC·XC·V,"For the sun fades them and they pass away,"
198,M·DCCC·XC·V,As I grow gray.
199,M·DCCC·XC·V,
200,M·DCCC·XC·V,Yet while they last how actual they seem!
201,M·DCCC·XC·V,Their faces beam;
202,M·DCCC·XC·V,"I give them all their names,"
203,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Bertram and Gilbert, Louis, Frank and James,"
204,M·DCCC·XC·V,Each with his aims;
205,M·DCCC·XC·V,"One thinks he is a poet, and writes verse"
206,M·DCCC·XC·V,His friends rehearse;
207,M·DCCC·XC·V,Another is full of law;
208,M·DCCC·XC·V,A third sees pictures which his hand can draw
209,M·DCCC·XC·V,Without a flaw.
210,M·DCCC·XC·V,
211,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Strangest of all, they never rest. Day long"
212,M·DCCC·XC·V,"They shift and throng,"
213,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Moved by invisible will,"
214,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Like a great breath which puffs across my sill,"
215,M·DCCC·XC·V,And then is still;
216,M·DCCC·XC·V,
217,M·DCCC·XC·V,It shakes my lovely manikins on the wall;
218,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Squall after squall,"
219,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Gust upon crowding gust,"
220,M·DCCC·XC·V,It sweeps them willy nilly like blown dust
221,M·DCCC·XC·V,With glory or lust.
222,M·DCCC·XC·V,
223,M·DCCC·XC·V,"It is the world-ghost, the time-spirit, come"
224,M·DCCC·XC·V,"None knows where from,"
225,M·DCCC·XC·V,The viewless draughty tide
226,M·DCCC·XC·V,"And wash of being. I hear it yaw and glide,"
227,M·DCCC·XC·V,"And then subside,"
228,M·DCCC·XC·V,
229,M·DCCC·XC·V,Along these ghostly corridors and halls
230,M·DCCC·XC·V,Like faint footfalls;
231,M·DCCC·XC·V,The hangings stir in the air;
232,M·DCCC·XC·V,"And when I start and challenge, ""Who goes there?"""
233,M·DCCC·XC·V,"It answers, ""Where?"""
234,M·DCCC·XC·V,
235,M·DCCC·XC·V,"The wail and sob and moan of the sea's dirge,"
236,M·DCCC·XC·V,Its plangor and surge;
237,M·DCCC·XC·V,The awful biting sough
238,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Of drifted snows along some arctic bluff,"
239,M·DCCC·XC·V,"That veer and luff,"
240,M·DCCC·XC·V,
241,M·DCCC·XC·V,"And have the vacant boding human cry,"
242,M·DCCC·XC·V,As they go by;--
243,M·DCCC·XC·V,Is it a banished soul
244,M·DCCC·XC·V,Dredging the dark like a distracted mole
245,M·DCCC·XC·V,Under a knoll?
246,M·DCCC·XC·V,
247,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Like some invisible henchman old and gray,"
248,M·DCCC·XC·V,Day after day
249,M·DCCC·XC·V,"I hear it come and go,"
250,M·DCCC·XC·V,"With stealthy swift unmeaning to and fro,"
251,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Muttering low,"
252,M·DCCC·XC·V,
253,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Ceaseless and daft and terrible and blind,"
254,M·DCCC·XC·V,Like a lost mind.
255,M·DCCC·XC·V,I often chill with fear
256,M·DCCC·XC·V,"When I bethink me, What if it should peer"
257,M·DCCC·XC·V,At my shoulder here!
258,M·DCCC·XC·V,
259,M·DCCC·XC·V,Perchance he drives the merry-go-round whose track
260,M·DCCC·XC·V,Is the zodiac;
261,M·DCCC·XC·V,His name is No-man's-friend;
262,M·DCCC·XC·V,"And his gabbling parrot-talk has neither trend,"
263,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Beginning, nor end."
264,M·DCCC·XC·V,
265,M·DCCC·XC·V,"A prince of madness too, I'd cry, ""A rat!"""
266,M·DCCC·XC·V,"And lunge thereat,--"
267,M·DCCC·XC·V,Let out at one swift thrust
268,M·DCCC·XC·V,The cunning arch-delusion of the dust
269,M·DCCC·XC·V,"I so mistrust,"
270,M·DCCC·XC·V,
271,M·DCCC·XC·V,But that I fear I should disclose a face
272,M·DCCC·XC·V,Wearing the trace
273,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Of my own human guise,"
274,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Piteous, unharmful, loving, sad, and wise,"
275,M·DCCC·XC·V,With the speaking eyes.
276,M·DCCC·XC·V,
277,M·DCCC·XC·V,"I would the house were rid of his grim pranks,"
278,M·DCCC·XC·V,Moaning from banks
279,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Of pine trees in the moon,"
280,M·DCCC·XC·V,Startling the silence like a demoniac loon
281,M·DCCC·XC·V,"At dead of noon,"
282,M·DCCC·XC·V,
283,M·DCCC·XC·V,Or whispering his fool-talk to the leaves
284,M·DCCC·XC·V,About my eaves.
285,M·DCCC·XC·V,And yet how can I know
286,M·DCCC·XC·V,'T is not a happy Ariel masking so
287,M·DCCC·XC·V,In mocking woe?
288,M·DCCC·XC·V,
289,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Then with a little broken laugh I say,"
290,M·DCCC·XC·V,Snatching away
291,M·DCCC·XC·V,The curtain where he grinned
292,M·DCCC·XC·V,"(My feverish sight thought) like a sin unsinned,"
293,M·DCCC·XC·V,"""Only the wind!"""
294,M·DCCC·XC·V,
295,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Yet often too he steals so softly by,"
296,M·DCCC·XC·V,"With half a sigh,"
297,M·DCCC·XC·V,"I deem he must be mild,"
298,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Fair as a woman, gentle as a child,"
299,M·DCCC·XC·V,And forest wild.
300,M·DCCC·XC·V,
301,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Passing the door where an old wind-harp swings,"
302,M·DCCC·XC·V,"With its five strings,"
303,M·DCCC·XC·V,Contrived long years ago
304,M·DCCC·XC·V,By my first predecessor bent to show
305,M·DCCC·XC·V,"His handcraft so,"
306,M·DCCC·XC·V,
307,M·DCCC·XC·V,"He lays his fingers on the æolian wire,"
308,M·DCCC·XC·V,As a core of fire
309,M·DCCC·XC·V,Is laid upon the blast
310,M·DCCC·XC·V,To kindle and glow and fill the purple vast
311,M·DCCC·XC·V,Of dark at last.
312,M·DCCC·XC·V,
313,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Weird wise and low, piercing and keen and glad,"
314,M·DCCC·XC·V,Or dim and sad
315,M·DCCC·XC·V,As a forgotten strain
316,M·DCCC·XC·V,Born when the broken legions of the rain
317,M·DCCC·XC·V,Swept through the plain--
318,M·DCCC·XC·V,
319,M·DCCC·XC·V,"He plays, like some dread veiled mysteriarch,"
320,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Lighting the dark,"
321,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Bidding the spring grow warm,"
322,M·DCCC·XC·V,"The gendering merge and loosing of spirit in form,"
323,M·DCCC·XC·V,Peace out of storm.
324,M·DCCC·XC·V,
325,M·DCCC·XC·V,For music is the sacrament of love;
326,M·DCCC·XC·V,He broods above
327,M·DCCC·XC·V,"The virgin silence, till"
328,M·DCCC·XC·V,"She yields for rapture shuddering, yearning still"
329,M·DCCC·XC·V,To his sweet will.
330,M·DCCC·XC·V,
331,M·DCCC·XC·V,"I hear him sing, ""Your harp is like a mesh,"
332,M·DCCC·XC·V,Woven of flesh
333,M·DCCC·XC·V,And spread within the shoal
334,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Of life, where runs the tide-race of the soul"
335,M·DCCC·XC·V,In my control.
336,M·DCCC·XC·V,
337,M·DCCC·XC·V,"""Though my wild way may ruin what it bends,"
338,M·DCCC·XC·V,It makes amends
339,M·DCCC·XC·V,"To the frail downy clocks,"
340,M·DCCC·XC·V,Telling their seed a secret that unlocks
341,M·DCCC·XC·V,The granite rocks.
342,M·DCCC·XC·V,
343,M·DCCC·XC·V,"""The womb of silence to the crave sound"
344,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Is heaven unfound,"
345,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Till I, to soothe and slake"
346,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Being's most utter and imperious ache,"
347,M·DCCC·XC·V,Bid rhythm awake.
348,M·DCCC·XC·V,
349,M·DCCC·XC·V,"""If with such agonies of bliss, my kin,"
350,M·DCCC·XC·V,I enter in
351,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Your prison house of sense,"
352,M·DCCC·XC·V,With what a joyous freed intelligence
353,M·DCCC·XC·V,"I shall go hence."""
354,M·DCCC·XC·V,
355,M·DCCC·XC·V,"I need no more to guess the weaver's name,"
356,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Nor ask his aim,"
357,M·DCCC·XC·V,Who hung each hall and room
358,M·DCCC·XC·V,With swarthy-tinged vermilion upon gloom;
359,M·DCCC·XC·V,I know that loom.
360,M·DCCC·XC·V,
361,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Give me a little space and time enough,"
362,M·DCCC·XC·V,From ravelings rough
363,M·DCCC·XC·V,"I could revive, reweave,"
364,M·DCCC·XC·V,A fabric of beauty art might well believe
365,M·DCCC·XC·V,Were past retrieve.
366,M·DCCC·XC·V,
367,M·DCCC·XC·V,"O men and women in that rich design,"
368,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Sleep-soft, sun-fine,"
369,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Dew-tenuous and free,"
370,M·DCCC·XC·V,"A tone of the infinite wind-themes of the sea,"
371,M·DCCC·XC·V,"Borne in to me,"
372,M·DCCC·XC·V,
373,M·DCCC·XC·V,Reveals how you were woven to the might
374,M·DCCC·XC·V,Of shadow and light.
375,M·DCCC·XC·V,You are the dream of One

1250,II,"Of wrath, though pent"
1251,II,Even when that white ghoul
1252,II,Comes for his rent.
1253,II,
1254,II,The landlord? Hush! My God!
1255,II,I think the walls
1256,II,Take notes to help him prod
1257,II,Us up. He galls
1258,II,
1259,II,"My very soul to strife,"
1260,II,With his death's-head face.
1261,II,"He is foul too in his life,"
1262,II,"Some hid disgrace,"
1263,II,
1264,II,"Some secret thing he does,"
1265,II,"I warrant you,"
1266,II,For all his cheek to us
1267,II,Is shaved so blue.
1268,II,
1269,II,He takes good care (by the shade
1270,II,Of seven wives!)
1271,II,That the undertaker's trade
1272,II,He lives by thrives.
1273,II,
1274,II,Nor chick nor child has he.
1275,II,"So servile smug,"
1276,II,"With that cringe in his knee,--"
1277,II,God curse his lug!
1278,II,
1279,II,"But him, you should have seen"
1280,II,Him yesterday;
1281,II,The landlord's smirk turned green
1282,II,At his smile. The way
1283,II,
1284,II,"He served that bloodless fish,"
1285,II,Were like to freeze him.
1286,II,"But meeting elsewhere, pish!"
1287,II,He never sees him.
1288,II,
1289,II,"Yet such a gentleman,"
1290,II,So sure and slow.
1291,II,The vilest harridan
1292,II,"Is not too low,"
1293,II,
1294,II,If there is pity's need;
1295,II,"And no man born,"
1296,II,For cruelty or greed
1297,II,Escapes that scorn.
1298,II,
1299,II,"Most of all things, it seems,"
1300,II,He loves the town.
1301,II,Watching the bright-faced streams
1302,II,"Go up and down,"
1303,II,
1304,II,I have surprised him often
1305,II,"On Tremont street,"
1306,II,"And marked the grave face soften,"
1307,II,"The mouth grow sweet,"
1308,II,
1309,II,In a brown study over
1310,II,The men and women.
1311,II,An unsuspected rover
1312,II,"That, for our Common."
1313,II,
1314,II,"When the first jonquils come,"
1315,II,And spring is sold
1316,II,"On the street corners, some"
1317,II,Of the pretty gold
1318,II,
1319,II,Is sure to find its way
1320,II,Home in his hand.
1321,II,And many a winter day
1322,II,"At some cab-stand,"
1323,II,
1324,II,He'll watch the cabmen feed
1325,II,"The pigeon flocks,"
1326,II,Or bid some liner speed
1327,II,From the icy docks.
1328,II,
1329,II,His rooms? I much regret
1330,II,You cannot see
1331,II,"His rooms, but they were let"
1332,II,With guarantee
1333,II,
1334,II,Of his seclusion there--
1335,II,Except myself.
1336,II,"Each morning, table, chair,"
1337,II,"Lamp, hearth, and shelf,"
1338,II,
1339,II,"I rearrange, refreshen,"
1340,II,"Put all to rights,"
1341,II,Then leave him in possession.
1342,II,"Ah, but the nights,"
1343,II,
1344,II,"The nights! Sir, if I dared"
1345,II,But once set eye
1346,II,"To keyhole, nor be scared,"
1347,II,"From playing Paul Pry,"
1348,II,
1349,II,I doubt not I should learn
1350,II,A wondrous thing
1351,II,Or two; and in return
1352,II,Go blind till spring.
1353,II,
1354,II,The light under his door
1355,II,"Is glory enough,"
1356,II,It outshines any star
1357,II,That I know of.
1358,II,
1359,II,"Wirrah, my lad, my lad,"
1360,II,"'T is fearsome strange,"
1361,II,The hints we all have had
1362,II,Passing the range
1363,II,
1364,II,"Of science, knowledge, law,"
1365,II,"Or what you will,"
1366,II,Whose intangible touch of awe
1367,II,Makes reason nil.
1368,II,
1369,II,"Many a night I start,"
1370,II,"Sudden awake,"
1371,II,Feeling my smothered heart
1372,II,Flutter and quake;
1373,II,
1374,II,"Like an aspen at dead of noon,"
1375,II,When not a breath
1376,II,Is stirring to trouble the boon
1377,II,Valley. A wraith
1378,II,
1379,II,"Or a fetch, it must be, shivers"
1380,II,The soul of the tree
1381,II,Till every leaf of it quivers.
1382,II,And so with me.
1383,II,
1384,II,Was it the shuffle of feet
1385,II,"I heard go by,"
1386,II,With muffled drums in the street?
1387,II,Was it the cry
1388,II,
1389,II,Of a rider riding the night
1390,II,"Into ashes and dawn,"
1391,II,With news in his nostrils and fright
1392,II,Where his hoof-beats had gone?
1393,II,
1394,II,"Did the pipes, at ""Bonny Dundee,"""
1395,II,Bid regiments form?
1396,II,Did a renegade's soul get free
1397,II,On a wail of the storm?
1398,II,
1399,II,Did a flock of wild geese honk
1400,II,As they cleared the hill?
1401,II,"Or only a bittern cronk,"
1402,II,Then all was still?
1403,II,
1404,II,Was it a night stampede
1405,II,Of a thousand head?
1406,II,I know I shook like a reed
1407,II,There on my bed.
1408,II,
1409,II,Nameless and void and wild
1410,II,"Was the fear before me,"
1411,II,Ere I bethought me and smiled
1412,II,As the truth flashed o'er me.
1413,II,
1414,II,"Of course, it was only his hand"
1415,II,Freeing the bass
1416,II,"Of his old Amati, grand"
1417,II,In the silence' face.
1418,II,
1419,II,"Rummaging up and down,"
1420,II,"From string to string,"
1421,II,"Bidding the discords drown,"
1422,II,"The harmonies spring,"
1423,II,
1424,II,Where tides and tide-winds rove
1425,II,"Far out from land,"
1426,II,On the ocean of music a-move
1427,II,At the will of his hand.
1428,II,
1429,II,"Sobbing and grieving now,"
1430,II,"Now glad as a bird,"
1431,II,"Thou, thou, thou"
1432,II,"Of the joys unheard,"
1433,II,
1434,II,Luminous radiant sea
1435,II,"Of the sounds and time,"
1436,II,"Surely, surely by thee"
1437,II,Is eternal prime.
1438,II,
1439,II,"Holy and beautiful deep,"
1440,II,Spread down before
1441,II,"The imperial coming of sleep,"
1442,II,"Endure, endure!"
1443,II,
1444,II,"And sleep, be thou the ranger"
1445,II,Over it wan.
1446,II,"And dream, be thou no stranger"
1447,II,There with the dawn.
1448,II,
1449,II,"Then wings of the sun, go abroad"
1450,II,"As a scarlet desire,"
1451,II,"Unwearied, unwaning, unawed,"
1452,II,"To quest and aspire,"
1453,II,
1454,II,Till the drench of the dusk you drink
1455,II,In the poppy-field west;
1456,II,Then veer and settle and sink
1457,II,As a gull to her nest.
1458,II,
1459,II,"Wind,"
1460,II,"Away, away!"
1461,II,And hurry your phantom kind
1462,II,"Through the gates of day,"
1463,II,
1464,II,Or ever the king's dark cup
1465,II,With its studs and spars
1466,II,"Be inverted, and earth look up"
1467,II,To the shuddering stars.
1468,II,
1469,II,"Blaring and triumphing now,"
1470,II,"Now quailing and lone,"
1471,II,"Thou, thou, thou"
1472,II,Of the joys unknown!
1473,II,
1474,II,"Unknown and wild, wild,"
1475,II,"Where the merrymen be,"
1476,II,"Sink to sleep, soul of a child,"
1477,II,"Slumber, thou sea!"
1478,II,
1479,II,"All this his fiddle plays,"
1480,II,And many a thing
1481,II,"As strange, when his mood so lays"
1482,II,The bow to the string.
1483,II,
1484,II,Sleepless! He never sleeps
1485,II,That I can find.
1486,II,I marvel how he keeps
1487,II,A bit of his mind.
1488,II,
1489,II,There is neither sight nor sound
1490,II,"In the world of sense,"
1491,II,But he has fathomed and found
1492,II,In the silvery tense
1493,II,
1494,II,Keen cords on the amber wood.
1495,II,"As he wrings them thence,"
1496,II,Death smiles at his hardihood
1497,II,For recompense.
1498,II,
1499,II,"Oh fair they are, so fair!"
1500,II,No tongue can tell
1501,II,How he sets them chiming there
1502,II,Clear as a bell.
1503,II,
1504,II,"An orchard of birds in June,"
1505,II,"The winds that stream,"
1506,II,"The cold sea-brooks that croon,"
1507,II,"The storms that scream,"
1508,II,
1509,II,The planets that float and swing
1510,II,"Like buoys on the tide,"
1511,II,"The north-going legions in spring,"
1512,II,"The hills that abide,"
1513,II,
1514,II,"The frigate-bird clouds that range,"
1515,II,The vagabond moon--
1516,II,That wilful lover of change--
1517,II,"And the workaday sun,"
1518,II,
1519,II,"Dying summer and fall,"
1520,II,Seasons and men
1521,II,"And herds, he has them all"
1522,II,In his shadowy ken.
1523,II,
1524,II,"He calls and they come, leaving strife,"
1525,II,"Leaving discord and death,"
1526,II,"Out of oblivion to life,"
1527,II,Though its span be a breath.
1528,II,
1529,II,"There they are, all the beautiful things"
1530,II,I loved and lost sight of
1531,II,"Long since in the far-away springs,"
1532,II,Come back for a night of
1533,II,
1534,II,"New being as good as their old,"
1535,II,"Aye, better in fact,"
1536,II,"For somehow he gilds their fine gold,--"
1537,II,"Gives the one thing they lacked,"
1538,II,
1539,II,"The breath, aspiration, desire,"
1540,II,"Core, kindle, control,"
1541,II,"Memory and rapture and fire,--"
1542,II,The touch of man's soul.
1543,II,
1544,II,How know the true master? I know
1545,II,"By my joys and my fears,"
1546,II,For my heart crumbles down like the snow
1547,II,With spring rain into tears.
1548,II,
1549,II,Now I am a precious one!
1550,II,With nothing to do
1551,II,But idle here in the sun
1552,II,And gossip with you
1553,II,
1554,II,"Of a stranger you have not seen,"
1555,II,As like never will.
1556,II,"I would every soul had a screen,"
1557,II,When the wind sets ill
1558,II,
1559,II,"In the world's bleak house, like this"
1560,II,Strange lodger of mine.
1561,II,His presence is worse to miss
1562,II,Than sun's best shine.
1563,II,
1564,II,I put no thought at all
1565,II,"Upon the end,"
1566,II,If only I may call
1567,II,Such a man friend.
1568,II,
1569,II,"And a friend he is, heart light"
1570,II,"With love for heft,"
1571,II,"Proud as silence, whose right"
1572,II,Hand ignores his left.
1573,II,
1574,II,"Yes, odd! he gives his name"
1575,II,As Spiritus.
1576,II,But that is vague as a flame
1577,II,In the wind to us.
1578,II,
1579,II,And then (but not a breath
1580,II,"Of this!) you see,"
1581,II,"All his effects, my faith!"
1582,II,Are marked D.V.
1583,II,
1584,II,"His cape-coat has a rip,"
1585,II,"But for all that,"
1586,II,"(Folk smile, suggest a dip"
1587,II,"In the dyer's vat,--"
1588,II,
1589,II,Those purple aldermen
1590,II,Who roll about
1591,II,"In coaches, drive till ten,"
1592,II,"And die of gout),"
1593,II,
1594,II,I think he finely shows
1595,II,How learning's crumbs
1596,II,At least can rival those
1597,II,"Of-- 'st, here he comes!"
1598,II,
1599,II,
1600,II,
1601,II,
1602,II,_Beyond the Gamut_
1603,II,
1604,II,
1605,II,"Softly, softly, Niccolo Amati!"
1606,II,What can put such fancies in your head?
1607,II,"There, go dream of your blue-skied Cremona,"
1608,II,While I ponder something you have said.
1609,II,
1610,II,Something in that last low lovely cadence
1611,II,"Piercing the green dusk alone and far,"
1612,II,"Named a new room in the house of knowledge,"
1613,II,"Waiting unfrequented, door ajar."
1614,II,
1615,II,"While you dream then, let me unmolested"
1616,II,"Pass in childish wonder through that door,--"
1617,II,"Breathless, touch and marvel at the beauties"
1618,II,Soon my wiser elders must explore.
1619,II,
1620,II,"Ah, my Niccolo, it's no great science"
1621,II,"We shall ever conquer, you and I."
1622,II,"Yet, when you are nestled at my shoulder,"
1623,II,Others guess not half that we descry.
1624,II,
1625,II,"As all sight is but a finer hearing,"
1626,II,"And all color but a finer sound,"
1627,II,"Beauty, but the reach of lyric freedom,"
1628,II,Caught and quivering past all music's bound;
1629,II,
1630,II,"Life, that faint sigh whispered from oblivion,"
1631,II,Harks and wonders if we may not be
1632,II,"Five small wits to carry one great rhythmus,"
1633,II,The vast theme of God's new symphony.
1634,II,
1635,II,"As fine sand spread on a disc of silver,"
1636,II,"At some chord which bids the motes combine,"
1637,II,"Heeding the hidden and reverberant impulse,"
1638,II,"Shifts and dances into curve and line,"
1639,II,
1640,II,"The round earth, too, haply, like a dust-mote,"
1641,II,"Was set whirling her assigned sure way,"
1642,II,Round this little orb of her ecliptic
1643,II,To some harmony she must obey.
1644,II,
1645,II,"Did the Master try the taut string merely,"
1646,II,"Give a touch, and she must throb to time?"
1647,II,"Think you how his bow must rouse the echoes,"
1648,II,"Quailing triumphing on, secure, sublime!"
1649,II,
1650,II,"Ah, thought cannot far without the symbol!"
1651,II,"Help me, little brother, hold the trend."
1652,II,"Dear good flesh, that keeps the spirit steady,"
1653,II,"Lest it faint, grown dizzy at thought's end!"
1654,II,
1655,II,"Waves of sound (Is this your thought, Amati?),"
1656,II,"Climbing into treble thin and clear,"
1657,II,"Past the silence, change to waves of color,"
1658,II,"We must say, when eye takes place of ear?"
1659,II,
1660,II,"Not a bird-song, but it has for fellow"
1661,II,"Some-wood-flower, its speechless counterpart,"
1662,II,"Form and color moulded to one cadence,"
1663,II,To voice something of the wild mute heart.
1664,II,
1665,II,"Thrushes, we'll suppose, have for their tune-mates"
1666,II,The gold languorous lilies of the glade;
1667,II,"And the whippoorwill, that plaintive dreamer,"
1668,II,Some dark purple flower that loves the shade.
1669,II,
1670,II,The song-sparrow tells me what the clover
1671,II,Nods about beneath the gorgeous blue;
1672,II,While the snowballs tell me old love-stories
1673,II,Thistle-birds half hinted as they flew.
1674,II,
1675,II,"April's faith, in robin at his vespers,"
1676,II,Breathes a prayer too in my lilac blooms.
1677,II,"What the cloudy asters told the hillside,"
1678,II,My lone rainbird in the dusk resumes.
1679,II,
1680,II,"Bobolink is voice for apple blossom,"
1681,II,"Breezy, abundant, good for human joys;"
1682,II,Oriole has touched the burning secret
1683,II,Poppies hide with their deliberate poise.
1684,II,
1685,II,"Tiny twin-flowers, what are they but fancies,"
1686,II,Subtler than a field-lark can express?
1687,II,Swallows make the low contented twitter
1688,II,Lying just beyond the pansies' guess.
1689,II,
1690,II,"Yellowbird, the hot noon's warbler, pierces"
1691,II,Sense where tiger-lilies may not pass.
1692,II,Are not crickets and all field-wise creatures
1693,II,Brahmins of the universal grass?
1694,II,
1695,II,"Saffron butterflies and mute ephemera,"
1696,II,"Doubt not, have their songs too, could we hear."
1697,II,Every raindrop is a sea sonorous
1698,II,As the great worlds thundering sphere to sphere.
1699,II,
1700,II,"There's no silence and no dark forever,"
1701,II,Clangoring suns to us are placid stars;
1702,II,Swift-foot lightning with his henchman thunder
1703,II,Lags behind these gnomes in Leyden jars.
1704,II,
1705,II,Peal and flash and thrill and scent and savour
1706,II,"Pulse through rhythm to rapture, and control,--"
1707,II,Who shall say how far along or finely?--
1708,II,The infinite tectonics of the soul.
1709,II,
1710,II,"Low-bred peoples, Hottentots, Basutos,"
1711,II,Have a taste for scarlet and brass bands.
1712,II,"Our friend Monet, feeling red repulsive,"
1713,II,Sees blue shadows in pale purple lands.
1714,II,
1715,II,"Sees not only, but instructs our seeing;"
1716,II,"Taught by him a twelvemonth, we confess"
1717,II,"Earth once robed in crude barbaric splendor,"
1718,II,Has put on a softer lovelier dress.
1719,II,
1720,II,"Feast my eyes on some old Indian fabric,"
1721,II,"Centuries of culture went to weave,"
1722,II,"And I grow the fine fastidious artist,"
1723,II,No mere shop-made textile can deceive.
1724,II,
1725,II,"Red the bass and violet the treble,"
1726,II,Soul may pass out where all color ends.
1727,II,"Ends? So we say, meaning where the eyesight"
1728,II,With some yet unborn perception blends.
1729,II,
1730,II,"You, Amati, never saw a sunset,--"
1731,II,Hear tornadoes in a spider's loom;
1732,II,"I, at my wits' end, may still develop"
1733,II,Unknown senses in life's larger room.
1734,II,
1735,II,Superhuman is not supernatural.
1736,II,How shall half-way judge of journey done?
1737,II,Shall this germ and protoplast of being
1738,II,Rest mid-life and say his race is run?
1739,II,
1740,II,"Softly there, my Niccolo, a moment!"
1741,II,Shall I then discard my simpler joys?
1742,II,"No, for look you, every sense's impulse"
1743,II,Is a means the master soul employs.
1744,II,
1745,II,"Test and use of all things, lowest, highest,"
1746,II,Are alone of import to the soul;
1747,II,"Joys of earth are journey-aids to heaven,"
1748,II,Garb of the new sainthood sane and whole.
1749,II,
1750,II,"Earth one habitat of spirit merely,"
1751,II,"I must use as richly as I may,--"
1752,II,"Touch environment with every sense-tip,"
1753,II,Drink the well and pass my wander way.
1754,II,
1755,II,"Ah, drink deep and let the parching morrow"
1756,II,Quench what thirst its newer need may bring!
1757,II,"Slake the senses now, that soul hereafter"
1758,II,Go not forth a starved defrauded thing.
1759,II,
1760,II,"Not for sense sake only, but for soul sake;"
1761,II,"That when soul must shed the leaves of sense,"
1762,II,"Sun and sap may solace and support her,"
1763,II,Stored in those green hours for her defence.
1764,II,
1765,II,Shall the grub deny himself the rose-leaf
1766,II,That he may be moth before his time?

2272,II,_At the Granite Gate_
2273,II,
2274,II,
2275,II,There paused to shut the door
2276,II,A fellow called the Wind.
2277,II,"With mystery before,"
2278,II,"And reticence behind,"
2279,II,
2280,II,A portal waits me too
2281,II,"In the glad house of spring,"
2282,II,One day I shall pass through
2283,II,And leave you wondering.
2284,II,
2285,II,It lies beyond the marge
2286,II,"Of evening or of prime,"
2287,II,"Silent and dim and large,"
2288,II,The gateway of all time.
2289,II,
2290,II,There troop by night and day
2291,II,My brothers of the field;
2292,II,And I shall know the way
2293,II,Their woodsongs have revealed.
2294,II,
2295,II,The dusk will hold some trace
2296,II,Of all my radiant crew
2297,II,"Who vanished to that place,"
2298,II,Ephemeral as dew.
2299,II,
2300,II,"Into the twilight dun,"
2301,II,Blue moth and dragon-fly
2302,II,"Adventuring alone,--"
2303,II,Shall be more brave than I?
2304,II,
2305,II,There innocents shall bloom
2306,II,"And the white cherry tree,"
2307,II,With birch and willow plume
2308,II,To strew the road for me.
2309,II,
2310,II,The wilding orioles then
2311,II,Shall make the golden air
2312,II,"Heavy with joy again,"
2313,II,And the dark heart shall dare
2314,II,
2315,II,"Resume the old desire,"
2316,II,The exigence of spring
2317,II,To be the orange fire
2318,II,That tips the world's gray wing.
2319,II,
2320,II,"And the lone wood-bird--Hark,"
2321,II,The whippoorwill night long
2322,II,Threshing the summer dark
2323,II,With his dim flail of song!--
2324,II,
2325,II,"Shall be the lyric lift,"
2326,II,"When all my senses creep,"
2327,II,To bear me through the rift
2328,II,In the blue range of sleep.
2329,II,
2330,II,And so I pass beyond
2331,II,The solace of your hand.
2332,II,"But ah, so brave and fond!"
2333,II,"Within that morrow land,"
2334,II,
2335,II,"Where deed and daring fail,"
2336,II,But joy forevermore
2337,II,Shall tremble and prevail
2338,II,"Against the narrow door,"
2339,II,
2340,II,"Where sorrow knocks too late,"
2341,II,"And grief is overdue,"
2342,II,Beyond the granite gate
2343,II,There will be thoughts of you.

2350,II,_Exit Anima_
2351,II,
2352,II,"""Hospes comesque corporis,"
2353,II,"Quae nunc abitis in loca?"""
2354,II,
2355,II,"Cease, Wind, to blow"
2356,II,"And drive the peopled snow,"
2357,II,"And move the haunted arras to and fro,"
2358,II,And moan of things I fear to know
2359,II,"Yet would rend from thee, Wind, before I go"
2360,II,On the blind pilgrimage.
2361,II,"Cease, Wind, to blow."
2362,II,
2363,II,"Thy brother too,"
2364,II,I leave no print of shoe
2365,II,"In all these vasty rooms I rummage through,"
2366,II,"No word at threshold, and no clue"
2367,II,Of whence I come and whither I pursue
2368,II,The search of treasures lost
2369,II,When time was new.
2370,II,
2371,II,Thou janitor
2372,II,"Of the dim curtained door,"
2373,II,Stir thy old bones along the dusty floor
2374,II,Of this unlighted corridor.
2375,II,Open! I have been this dark way before;
2376,II,Thy hollow face shall peer
2377,II,In mine no more. . . . .
2378,II,
2379,II,"Sky, the dear sky!"
2380,II,"Ah, ghostly house, good-by!"
2381,II,I leave thee as the gauzy dragon-fly
2382,II,Leaves the green pool to try
2383,II,"His vast ambition on the vaster sky,--"
2384,II,Such valor against death
2385,II,Is deity.
2386,II,
2387,II,"What, thou too here,"
2388,II,Thou haunting whisperer?
2389,II,"Spirit of beauty immanent and sheer,"
2390,II,"Art thou that crooked servitor,"
2391,II,"Done with disguise, from whose malignant leer"
2392,II,Out of the ghostly house
2393,II,I fled in fear?
2394,II,
2395,II,"O Beauty, how"
2396,II,"I do repent me now,"
2397,II,Of all the doubt I ever could allow
2398,II,To shake me like the aspen bough;
2399,II,Nor once imagine that unsullied brow
2400,II,Could wear the evil mask
2401,II,And still be thou!
2402,II,
2403,II,"Bone of thy bone,"
2404,II,"Breath of thy breath alone,"
2405,II,"I dare resume the silence of a stone,"
2406,II,"Or explore still the vast unknown,"
2407,II,"Like a bright sea-bird through the morning blown,"
2408,II,"With all his heart one joy,"
2409,II,From zone to zone.

2419,II,
2420,II,One block of ten lines from the title poem was printed without break:
2421,II,
2422,II,Yet while they last how actual they seem!
2423,II,Their faces beam;
2424,II,"I give them all their names,"
2425,II,"Bertram and Gilbert, Louis, Frank and James,"
2426,II,Each with his aims;
2427,II,"One thinks he is a poet, and writes verse"
2428,II,His friends rehearse;
2429,II,Another is full of law;
2430,II,A third sees pictures which his hand can draw
2431,II,Without a flaw.
2432,II,
2433,II,This may be a typographical error.
