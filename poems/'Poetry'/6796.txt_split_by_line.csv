235,THE MEETING.,THE MEETING.
236,THE MEETING.,
237,THE MEETING.,"I see her still--by her fair train surrounded,"
238,THE MEETING.,"The fairest of them all, she took her place;"
239,THE MEETING.,"Afar I stood, by her bright charms confounded,"
240,THE MEETING.,"For, oh! they dazzled with their heavenly grace."
241,THE MEETING.,"With awe my soul was filled--with bliss unbounded,"
242,THE MEETING.,While gazing on her softly radiant face;
243,THE MEETING.,"But soon, as if up-borne on wings of fire,"
244,THE MEETING.,My fingers 'gan to sweep the sounding lyre.
245,THE MEETING.,
246,THE MEETING.,"The thoughts that rushed across me in that hour,"
247,THE MEETING.,"The words I sang, I'd fain once more invoke;"
248,THE MEETING.,"Within, I felt a new-awakened power,"
249,THE MEETING.,That each emotion of my bosom spoke.
250,THE MEETING.,"My soul, long time enchained in sloth's dull bower,"
251,THE MEETING.,"Through all its fetters now triumphant broke,"
252,THE MEETING.,"And brought to light unknown, harmonious numbers,"
253,THE MEETING.,"Which in its deepest depths, had lived in slumbers."
254,THE MEETING.,
255,THE MEETING.,"And when the chords had ceased their gentle sighing,"
256,THE MEETING.,"And when my soul rejoined its mortal frame,"
257,THE MEETING.,"I looked upon her face and saw love vieing,"
258,THE MEETING.,"In every feature, with her maiden shame."
259,THE MEETING.,"And soon my ravished heart seemed heavenward flying,"
260,THE MEETING.,When her soft whisper o'er my senses came.
261,THE MEETING.,The blissful seraphs' choral strains alone
262,THE MEETING.,"Can glad mine ear again with that sweet tone,"
263,THE MEETING.,
264,THE MEETING.,"Of that fond heart, which, pining silently,"
265,THE MEETING.,"Ne'er ventures to express its feelings lowly,"
266,THE MEETING.,The real and modest worth is known to me--
267,THE MEETING.,'Gainst cruel fate I'll guard its cause so holy.
268,THE MEETING.,"Most blest of all, the meek one's lot shall be--"
269,THE MEETING.,Love's flowers by love's own hand are gathered solely--
270,THE MEETING.,"The fairest prize to that fond heart is due,"
271,THE MEETING.,"That feels it, and that beats responsive, too!"

276,THE SECRET.,THE SECRET.
277,THE SECRET.,
278,THE SECRET.,"She sought to breathe one word, but vainly;"
279,THE SECRET.,Too many listeners were nigh;
280,THE SECRET.,And yet my timid glance read plainly
281,THE SECRET.,The language of her speaking eye.
282,THE SECRET.,"Thy silent glades my footstep presses,"
283,THE SECRET.,Thou fair and leaf-embosomed grove!
284,THE SECRET.,Conceal within thy green recesses
285,THE SECRET.,From mortal eye our sacred love!
286,THE SECRET.,
287,THE SECRET.,"Afar with strange discordant noises,"
288,THE SECRET.,The busy day is echoing;
289,THE SECRET.,"And 'mid the hollow hum of voices,"
290,THE SECRET.,I hear the heavy hammer ring.
291,THE SECRET.,"'Tis thus that man, with toil ne'er ending"
292,THE SECRET.,Extorts from heaven his daily bread;
293,THE SECRET.,Yet oft unseen the Gods are sending
294,THE SECRET.,The gifts of fortune on his head!
295,THE SECRET.,
296,THE SECRET.,"Oh, let mankind discover never"
297,THE SECRET.,How true love fills with bliss our hearts
298,THE SECRET.,"They would but crush our joy forever,"
299,THE SECRET.,For joy to them no glow imparts.
300,THE SECRET.,Thou ne'er wilt from the world obtain it--
301,THE SECRET.,'Tis never captured save as prey;
302,THE SECRET.,"Thou needs must strain each nerve to gain it,"
303,THE SECRET.,E'er envy dark asserts her sway.
304,THE SECRET.,
305,THE SECRET.,"The hours of night and stillness loving,"
306,THE SECRET.,It comes upon us silently--
307,THE SECRET.,Away with hasty footstep moving
308,THE SECRET.,Soon as it sees a treacherous eye.
309,THE SECRET.,"Thou gentle stream, soft circlets weaving,"
310,THE SECRET.,"A watery barrier cast around,"
311,THE SECRET.,"And, with thy waves in anger heaving,"
312,THE SECRET.,Guard from each foe this holy ground!

317,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],THE ASSIGNATION. [14]
318,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],
319,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],Hear I the creaking gate unclose?
320,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],The gleaming latch uplifted?
321,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"No--'twas the wind that, whirring, rose,"
322,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],Amidst the poplars drifted!
323,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"Adorn thyself, thou green leaf-bowering roof,"
324,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"Destined the bright one's presence to receive,"
325,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"For her, a shadowy palace-hall aloof"
326,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"With holy night, thy boughs familiar weave."
327,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"And ye sweet flatteries of the delicate air,"
328,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"Awake and sport her rosy cheek around,"
329,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"When their light weight the tender feet shall bear,"
330,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],When beauty comes to passion's trysting-ground.
331,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],
332,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],Hush! what amidst the copses crept--
333,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],So swiftly by me now?
334,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],No-'twas the startled bird that swept
335,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],The light leaves of the bough!
336,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"Day, quench thy torch! come, ghostlike, from on high,"
337,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"With thy loved silence, come, thou haunting Eve,"
338,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"Broaden below thy web of purple dye,"
339,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],Which lulled boughs mysterious round us weave.
340,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"For love's delight, enduring listeners none,"
341,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],The froward witness of the light will flee;
342,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"Hesper alone, the rosy silent one,"
343,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],Down-glancing may our sweet familiar be!
344,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],
345,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"What murmur in the distance spoke,"
346,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],And like a whisper died?
347,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],No--'twas the swan that gently broke
348,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],In rings the silver tide!
349,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],Soft to my ear there comes a music-flow;
350,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],In gleesome murmur glides the waterfall;
351,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],To zephyr's kiss the flowers are bending low;
352,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"Through life goes joy, exchanging joy with all."
353,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"Tempt to the touch the grapes--the blushing fruit, [15]"
354,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],Voluptuous swelling from the leaves that bide;
355,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"And, drinking fever from my cheek, the mute"
356,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],Air sleeps all liquid in the odor-tide!
357,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],
358,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],Hark! through the alley hear I now
359,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],A footfall? Comes the maiden?
360,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"No,--'twas the fruit slid from the bough,"
361,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],With its own richness laden!
362,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],
363,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"Day's lustrous eyes grow heavy in sweet death,"
364,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"And pale and paler wane his jocund hues,"
365,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"The flowers too gentle for his glowing breath,"
366,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],Ope their frank beauty to the twilight dews.
367,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"The bright face of the moon is still and lone,"
368,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],Melts in vast masses the world silently;
369,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],Slides from each charm the slowly-loosening zone;
370,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"And round all beauty, veilless, roves the eye."
371,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],
372,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],What yonder seems to glimmer?
373,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],Her white robe's glancing hues?
374,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"No,--'twas the column's shimmer"
375,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],Athwart the darksome yews!
376,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],
377,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"O, longing heart, no more delight-upbuoyed"
378,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],Let the sweet airy image thee befool!
379,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],The arms that would embrace her clasp the void
380,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"This feverish breast no phantom-bliss can cool,"
381,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"O, waft her here, the true, the living one!"
382,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"Let but my hand her hand, the tender, feel--"
383,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],The very shadow of her robe alone!--
384,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],So into life the idle dream shall steal!
385,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],
386,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"As glide from heaven, when least we ween,"
387,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"The rosy hours of bliss,"
388,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],"All gently came the maid, unseen:--"
389,THE ASSIGNATION. [14],He waked beneath her kiss!

398,LONGING.,"Soar to some more blissful sphere,"
399,LONGING.,Ah! how happy should I be!
400,LONGING.,"Distant hills enchant my sight,"

404,LONGING.,
405,LONGING.,"Harmonies mine ear assail,"

408,LONGING.,Greets me with its fragrant balm.
409,LONGING.,"Peeping through the shady bowers,"
410,LONGING.,Golden fruits their charms display.
411,LONGING.,And those sweetly-blooming flowers
412,LONGING.,Ne'er become cold winter's prey.
413,LONGING.,
414,LONGING.,"In you endless sunshine bright,"
415,LONGING.,Oh! what bliss 'twould be to dwell!
416,LONGING.,How the breeze on yonder height
417,LONGING.,Must the heart with rapture swell!
418,LONGING.,Yet the stream that hems my path
419,LONGING.,"Checks me with its angry frown,"
420,LONGING.,"While its waves, in rising wrath,"
421,LONGING.,Weigh my weary spirit down.
422,LONGING.,
423,LONGING.,"See--a bark is drawing near,"
424,LONGING.,"But, alas, the pilot fails!"
425,LONGING.,Enter boldly--wherefore fear?
426,LONGING.,"Inspiration fills its sails,"
427,LONGING.,"Faith and courage make thine own,--"

463,THE PILGRIM.,
464,THE PILGRIM.,Youth's gay springtime scarcely knowing
465,THE PILGRIM.,Went I forth the world to roam--
466,THE PILGRIM.,"And the dance of youth, the glowing,"
467,THE PILGRIM.,"Left I in my father's home,"
468,THE PILGRIM.,"Of my birthright, glad-believing,"
469,THE PILGRIM.,"Of my world-gear took I none,"
470,THE PILGRIM.,"Careless as an infant, cleaving"
471,THE PILGRIM.,To my pilgrim staff alone.
472,THE PILGRIM.,For I placed my mighty hope in
473,THE PILGRIM.,"Dim and holy words of faith,"
474,THE PILGRIM.,"""Wander forth--the way is open,"
475,THE PILGRIM.,Ever on the upward path--
476,THE PILGRIM.,"Till thou gain the golden portal,"
477,THE PILGRIM.,Till its gates unclose to thee.
478,THE PILGRIM.,"There the earthly and the mortal,"
479,THE PILGRIM.,"Deathless and divine shall be!"""
480,THE PILGRIM.,"Night on morning stole, on stealeth,"
481,THE PILGRIM.,"Never, never stand I still,"
482,THE PILGRIM.,"And the future yet concealeth,"
483,THE PILGRIM.,"What I seek, and what I will!"
484,THE PILGRIM.,"Mount on mount arose before me,"
485,THE PILGRIM.,"Torrents hemmed me every side,"
486,THE PILGRIM.,But I built a bridge that bore me
487,THE PILGRIM.,O'er the roaring tempest-tide.
488,THE PILGRIM.,"Towards the east I reached a river,"
489,THE PILGRIM.,On its shores I did not rest;
490,THE PILGRIM.,"Faith from danger can deliver,"
491,THE PILGRIM.,And I trusted to its breast.
492,THE PILGRIM.,"Drifted in the whirling motion,"
493,THE PILGRIM.,Seas themselves around me roll--

8020,SHAKESPEARE.,"[29]  It may be scarcely necessary to treat, however briefly, of the"
8021,SHAKESPEARE.,mythological legend on which this exquisite elegy is founded; yet we
8022,SHAKESPEARE.,venture to do so rather than that the forgetfulness of the reader should
8023,SHAKESPEARE.,"militate against his enjoyment of the poem.  Proserpine, according to the"
8024,SHAKESPEARE.,"Homeride (for the story is not without variations), when gathering"
8025,SHAKESPEARE.,"flowers with the Ocean-Nymphs, is carried off by Aidoneus, or Pluto. Her"
8026,SHAKESPEARE.,"mother, Ceres, wanders over the earth for her in vain, and refuses to"
8027,SHAKESPEARE.,"return to heaven till her daughter is restored to her.  Finally, Jupiter"
8028,SHAKESPEARE.,"commissions Hermes to persuade Pluto to render up his bride, who rejoins"
8029,SHAKESPEARE.,Ceres at Eleusis.  Unfortunately she has swallowed a pomegranate seed in
8030,SHAKESPEARE.,"the Shades below, and is thus mysteriously doomed to spend one-third of"
8031,SHAKESPEARE.,"the year with her husband in Hades, though for the remainder of the year"
8032,SHAKESPEARE.,she is permitted to dwell with Ceres and the gods.  This is one of the
8033,SHAKESPEARE.,very few mythological fables of Greece which can be safely interpreted
8034,SHAKESPEARE.,into an allegory.  Proserpine denotes the seed-corn one-third of the year
8035,SHAKESPEARE.,"below the earth; two-thirds (that is, dating from the appearance of the"
8036,SHAKESPEARE.,ear) above it. Schiller has treated this story with admirable and
8037,SHAKESPEARE.,"artistic beauty; and, by an alteration in its symbolical character has"
8038,SHAKESPEARE.,"preserved the pathos of the external narrative, and heightened the beauty"
8039,SHAKESPEARE.,of the interior meaning--associating the productive principle of the
8040,SHAKESPEARE.,earth with the immortality of the soul.  Proserpine here is not the
8041,SHAKESPEARE.,"symbol of the buried seed, but the buried seed is the symbol of her--that"
8042,SHAKESPEARE.,"is, of the dead.  The exquisite feeling of this poem consoled Schiller's"
8043,SHAKESPEARE.,"friend, Sophia La Roche, in her grief for her son's death."
8044,SHAKESPEARE.,[30]  What a beautiful vindication of the shortness of human life!

8052,SHAKESPEARE.,"[34]  We have already seen in ""The Ring of Polycrates,"" Schiller's mode"
8053,SHAKESPEARE.,"of dealing with classical subjects.  In the poems that follow, derived"
8054,SHAKESPEARE.,"from similar sources, the same spirit is maintained.  In spite of"
8055,SHAKESPEARE.,"Humboldt, we venture to think that Schiller certainly does not narrate"
8056,SHAKESPEARE.,"Greek legends in the spirit of an ancient Greek.  The Gothic sentiment,"
8057,SHAKESPEARE.,"in its ethical depth and mournful tenderness, more or less pervades all"
8058,SHAKESPEARE.,that he translates from classic fable into modern pathos.  The grief of
8059,SHAKESPEARE.,"Hero in the ballad subjoined, touches closely on the lamentations of"
8060,SHAKESPEARE.,"Thekla, in ""Wallenstein.""  The Complaint of Ceres, embodies Christian"
8061,SHAKESPEARE.,grief and Christian hope.  The Trojan Cassandra expresses the moral of
8062,SHAKESPEARE.,"the Northern Faust.  Even the ""Victory Feast"" changes the whole spirit of"
8063,SHAKESPEARE.,"Homer, on whom it is founded, by the introduction of the ethical"
8064,SHAKESPEARE.,"sentiment at the close, borrowed, as a modern would apply what he so"
8065,SHAKESPEARE.,borrows from the moralizing Horace.  Nothing can be more foreign to the
8066,SHAKESPEARE.,"Hellenic genius, (if we except the very disputable intention of the"
8067,SHAKESPEARE.,"""Prometheus""), than the interior and typical design which usually exalts"
8068,SHAKESPEARE.,every conception in Schiller.  But it is perfectly open to the modern
8069,SHAKESPEARE.,poet to treat of ancient legends in the modern spirit. Though he selects
8070,SHAKESPEARE.,"a Greek story, he is still a modern who narrates--he can never make"
8071,SHAKESPEARE.,"himself a Greek any more than Aeschylus in the ""Persae"" could make"
8072,SHAKESPEARE.,himself a Persian. But this is still more the privilege of the poet in
8073,SHAKESPEARE.,"narrative, or lyrical composition, than in the drama, for in the former"
8074,SHAKESPEARE.,"he does not abandon his identity, as in the latter he must--yet even this"
8075,SHAKESPEARE.,must has its limits. Shakspeare's wonderful power of self-transfusion has
8076,SHAKESPEARE.,"no doubt enabled him, in his plays from Roman history, to animate his"
8077,SHAKESPEARE.,characters with much of Roman life. But no one can maintain that a Roman
8078,SHAKESPEARE.,"would ever have written plays in the least resembling ""Julius Caesar,"" or"
8079,SHAKESPEARE.,"""Coriolanus,"" or ""Antony and Cleopatra.""  The portraits may be Roman, but"
8080,SHAKESPEARE.,they are painted in the manner of the Gothic school. The spirit of
8081,SHAKESPEARE.,"antiquity is only in them, inasmuch as the representation of human"
8082,SHAKESPEARE.,"nature, under certain circumstances, is accurately, though loosely"
8083,SHAKESPEARE.,"outlined. When the poet raises the dead, it is not to restore, but to"
8084,SHAKESPEARE.,remodel.

8091,SHAKESPEARE.,"[37]  This story, the heroes of which are more properly known to us under"
8092,SHAKESPEARE.,"the names of Damon and Pythias (or Phintias), Schiller took from Hyginus"
8093,SHAKESPEARE.,in whom the friends are called Moerus and Selinuntius.  Schiller has
8094,SHAKESPEARE.,"somewhat amplified the incidents in the original, in which the delay of"
8095,SHAKESPEARE.,Moerus is occasioned only by the swollen stream--the other hindrances are
8096,SHAKESPEARE.,"of Schiller's invention.  The subject, like ""The Ring of Polycrates,"""
8097,SHAKESPEARE.,does not admit of that rich poetry of description with which our author
8098,SHAKESPEARE.,usually adorns some single passage in his narratives.  The poetic spirit
8099,SHAKESPEARE.,is rather shown in the terse brevity with which picture after picture is
8100,SHAKESPEARE.,not only sketched but finished--and in the great thought at the close.
8101,SHAKESPEARE.,Still it is not one of Schiller's best ballads.  His additions to the
8102,SHAKESPEARE.,original story are not happy.  The incident of the robbers is commonplace
8103,SHAKESPEARE.,and poor.  The delay occasioned by the thirst of Moerus is clearly open
8104,SHAKESPEARE.,to Goethe's objection (an objection showing very nice perception of
8105,SHAKESPEARE.,nature)--that extreme thirst was not likely to happen to a man who had
8106,SHAKESPEARE.,"lately passed through a stream on a rainy day, and whose clothes must"
8107,SHAKESPEARE.,have been saturated with moisture--nor in the traveller's preoccupied
8108,SHAKESPEARE.,"state of mind, is it probable that he would have so much felt the mere"
8109,SHAKESPEARE.,"physical want.  With less reason has it been urged by other critics, that"
8110,SHAKESPEARE.,the sudden relenting of the tyrant is contrary to his character.  The
8111,SHAKESPEARE.,tyrant here has no individual character at all.  He is the mere
8112,SHAKESPEARE.,personation of disbelief in truth and love--which the spectacle of
8113,SHAKESPEARE.,sublime self-abnegation at once converts.  In this idea lies the deep
8114,SHAKESPEARE.,"philosophical truth, which redeems all the defects of the piece--for"
8115,SHAKESPEARE.,"poetry, in its highest form, is merely this--""Truth made beautiful."""
8116,SHAKESPEARE.,
8117,SHAKESPEARE.,[38]  The somewhat irregular metre of the original has been preserved
8118,SHAKESPEARE.,"in this ballad, as in other poems; although the perfect anapaestic metre"
8119,SHAKESPEARE.,is perhaps more familiar to the English ear.

8137,SHAKESPEARE.,[43]  It seems generally agreed that poetry is allegorized in these
8138,SHAKESPEARE.,"stanzas; though, with this interpretation, it is difficult to"
8139,SHAKESPEARE.,"reconcile the sense of some of the lines--for instance, the last in"
8140,SHAKESPEARE.,the first stanza.  How can poetry be said to leave no trace when she
8141,SHAKESPEARE.,takes farewell?

8167,SHAKESPEARE.,
8168,SHAKESPEARE.,[52]  This poem is very characteristic of the noble ease with which
8169,SHAKESPEARE.,"Schiller often loves to surprise the reader, by the sudden introduction"
8170,SHAKESPEARE.,of matter for the loftiest reflection in the midst of the most familiar
8171,SHAKESPEARE.,subjects.  What can be more accurate and happy than the poet's description
8172,SHAKESPEARE.,"of the national dance, as if such description were his only object--the"
8173,SHAKESPEARE.,"outpouring, as it were, of a young gallant intoxicated by the music, and"
8174,SHAKESPEARE.,dizzy with the waltz?  Suddenly and imperceptibly the reader finds himself
8175,SHAKESPEARE.,elevated from a trivial scene.  He is borne upward to the harmony of the
8176,SHAKESPEARE.,sphere.  He bows before the great law of the universe--the young gallant
8177,SHAKESPEARE.,is transformed into the mighty teacher; and this without one hard conceit
8178,SHAKESPEARE.,--without one touch of pedantry.  It is but a flash of light; and where
8179,SHAKESPEARE.,glowed the playful picture shines the solemn moral.

8181,SHAKESPEARE.,[53]  The first five verses in the original of this poem are placed as
8182,SHAKESPEARE.,a motto on Goethe's statue in the Library at Weimar.  The poet does not
8183,SHAKESPEARE.,here mean to extol what is vulgarly meant by the gifts of fortune; he
8184,SHAKESPEARE.,"but develops a favorite idea of his, that, whatever is really sublime"
8185,SHAKESPEARE.,"and beautiful, comes freely down from heaven; and vindicates the seeming"
8186,SHAKESPEARE.,"partiality of the gods, by implying that the beauty and the genius given,"
8187,SHAKESPEARE.,"without labor, to some, but serve to the delight of those to whom they are"
8188,SHAKESPEARE.,denied.

8196,SHAKESPEARE.,"As Hercules contended in vain against Antaeus, the Son of Earth--so long"
8197,SHAKESPEARE.,"as the earth gave her giant offspring new strength in every fall,--so"
8198,SHAKESPEARE.,"the soul contends in vain with evil--the natural earth-born enemy, while"
8199,SHAKESPEARE.,the very contact of the earth invigorates the enemy for the struggle.
8200,SHAKESPEARE.,"And as Antaeus was slain at last, when Hercules lifted him from the earth,"
8201,SHAKESPEARE.,"and strangled him while raised aloft, so can the soul slay the enemy (the"
8202,SHAKESPEARE.,"desire, the passion, the evil, the earth's offspring), when bearing it"
8203,SHAKESPEARE.,"from earth itself, and stifling it in the higher air."

8208,SHAKESPEARE.,we are truly then under the influence of the sublime.
