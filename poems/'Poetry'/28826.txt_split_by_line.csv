30,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,
31,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,
32,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,"Farewell, grey Albyn, much loved land,"
33,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,I ne'er shall see thy hills again;
34,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,Upon those hills I oft would stand
35,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,And view the chase sweep o'er the plain.
36,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,
37,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,'Twas pleasant from their tops I ween
38,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,To see the stag that bounding ran;
39,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,"And all the rout of hunters keen,"
40,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,The sons of Usna in the van.
41,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,
42,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,"The chiefs of Albyn feasted high,"
43,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,Amidst them Usna's children shone;
44,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,And Nasa kissed in secrecy
45,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,The daughter fair of high Dundron.
46,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,
47,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,"To her a milk-white doe he sent,"
48,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,With little fawn that frisked and played
49,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,"And once to visit her he went,"
50,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,As home from Inverness he strayed.
51,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,
52,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,The news was scarcely brought to me
53,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,When jealous rage inflamed my mind;
54,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,"I took my boat and rushed to sea,"
55,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,"For death, for speedy death, inclined."
56,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,
57,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,But swiftly swimming at my stern
58,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,Came Ainlie bold and Ardan tall;
59,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,Those faithful striplings made me turn
60,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,And brought me back to Nasa's hall.
61,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,
62,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,"Then thrice he swore upon his arms,"
63,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,"His burnished arms, the foeman's bane,"
64,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,That he would never wake alarms
65,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,In this fond breast of mine again.
66,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,
67,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,"Dundron's fair daughter also swore,"
68,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,"And called to witness earth and sky,"
69,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,That since his love for her was o'er
70,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,A maiden she would live and die.
71,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,
72,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,"Ah did she know that slain in fight,"
73,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,"He wets with gore the Irish hill,"
74,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,"How great would be her moan this night,"
75,THE SONG OF DEIRDRA,But greater far would mine be still.

81,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN
82,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
83,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
84,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"""Where is the man who will dive for his King,"
85,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,In the pool as it rushes with turbulent sweep?
86,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"A cup from this surf-beaten jetty I fling,"
87,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"And he who will seek it below in the deep,"
88,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"And will bring it again to the light of the day,"
89,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,As the meed of his valour shall bear it away.
90,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
91,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"""Now courage, my knights, and my warriors bold,"
92,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"For, one, two, and three, and away it shall go--"""
93,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"He toss'd, as he said it, the goblet of gold"
94,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"Deep, deep in the howling abysses below.--"
95,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"""Where is the hero who ventures to brave"
96,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"The whirl of the pool, and the break of the wave?"""
97,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
98,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"The steel-coated lancemen, and nobles around,"
99,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"Spoke not, but they trembled in silent surprise,"
100,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"And pale they all stood on the cliff's giddy bound,"
101,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,And no one would venture to dive for the prize.
102,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"""Three times have I spoke, but no hero will spring"
103,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"And dive for the goblet, and dive for the King."""
104,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
105,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"But still they were silent and pale as before,"
106,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"Till a brave son of Eirin, in venturous pride,"
107,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,Dash'd forth from the lancemen's trembling corps
108,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"And canted his helm, cast his mantle aside,"
109,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"While spearman, and noble, and lady, and knight,"
110,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,Gazed on the bold stripling in breathless affright.
111,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
112,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"Unmoved by the thoughts of his horrible doom,"
113,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"He mounted the cliff--and he paus'd on his leap,"
114,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,For the waves which the pool had imbibed in its womb
115,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"Were spouted in thunder again from the deep,--"
116,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"Yes! as they return'd, their report was as loud"
117,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,As the peal when it bursts from the storm-riven cloud.
118,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
119,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"It roared, and it drizzled, it hiss'd and it whirl'd,"
120,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"And it bubbled like water when mingled with flame,"
121,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"And columns of foam to the heaven were hurl'd,"
122,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,And billow on billow tumultuously came;
123,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,It seem'd that the womb of the ocean would bear
124,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,Sea over sea to the uppermost air.
125,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
126,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"It thundered again as the wave gathered slow,"
127,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"And black from the drizzling foam as it fell,"
128,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,The mouth of the fathomless tunnel below
129,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,Was seen like the pass to the regions of hell;
130,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"The waters roll round it, and gather and boom,"
131,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,And then all at once disappear in the gloom.
132,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
133,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"And now ere the waves had returned from the deep,"
134,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"The youth wiped the sweat-drops which hung on his brows,"
135,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"And he plunged--and the cataracts over him sweep,"
136,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,And a shout from his terrified comrades arose;
137,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,And then there succeeded a horrible pause
138,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,For the whirlpool had clos'd its mysterious jaws.
139,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
140,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"And stiller it grew on the watery waste,"
141,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"In the womb of the ocean it bellow'd alone,"
142,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"The knights said their Aves in terrified haste,"
143,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"And crowded each pinnacle, jetty, and stone:"
144,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"""The high-hearted stripling is whelm'd in the tide,"
145,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"Ah! wail him,"" was echoed from every side."
146,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
147,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"""If the monarch had buried his crown in the pool"
148,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"And said: 'He shall wear it who brings it again,'"
149,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,I would not have been so insensate a fool
150,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,As to dive when all hope of returning were vain;
151,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"What heaven conceals in the gulfs of the deep,"
152,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"Lies buried for ever, and there it must sleep."""
153,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
154,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"Full many a burden the whirlpool had borne,"
155,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"And spouted it forth on the drizzling surge,"
156,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"But nought but a mast that was splinter'd and torn,"
157,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,Or the hull of a vessel was seen to emerge;
158,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"But wider and wider it opens its jaws,"
159,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"And louder it gurgles, and louder it draws."
160,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
161,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"It drizzled, it thunder'd, it hiss'd and it whirl'd,"
162,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"And it bubbled like water when mingled with flame,"
163,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"And columns of foam to the heaven were hurl'd,"
164,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,And flood upon flood from the deep tunnel came;
165,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"And then with a noise like the storm from the North,"
166,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,The hellish eruption was vomited forth.
167,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
168,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"But, ah! what is that on the wave's foamy brim,"
169,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,Disgorged with an ocean of wreck and of wood?
170,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,'Tis the snow-white arm and the shoulder of him
171,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,Who daringly dived for the glittering meed:
172,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"'Tis he, 'tis the stripling so hardy and bold,"
173,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,Who swings in his left hand the goblet of gold.
174,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
175,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"He draws a long breath as the breaker he leaves,"
176,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"Then swims through the water with many a strain,"
177,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,While all his companions exultingly heave
178,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,Their voices above the wild din of the main:
179,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"""'Tis he, O! 'tis he, from the horrible hole"
180,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"The brave one has rescued his body and soul."""
181,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
182,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"He reach'd the tall jetty, and kneeling he laid"
183,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,The massy gold goblet in triumph and pride
184,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"At the foot of the monarch, who instantly made"
185,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,A sign to his daughter who stood by his side:
186,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"She fill'd it with wine, and the youth with a spring"
187,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"Received it, and quaff'd it, and turn'd to the King."
188,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
189,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"""Long life to the monarch! how happy are they"
190,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"Who breathe and exist in the sun's rosy light,"
191,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"But he who is doom'd in the ocean to stray,"
192,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,Views nothing around him but horror and night;
193,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,Let no one henceforward be tempted like me
194,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,To pry in the secrets contain'd in the sea.
195,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
196,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"""I felt myself seized, with the quickness of thought"
197,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"The whirlpool entomb'd me in body and limb,"
198,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,And billow on billow tumultuously brought
199,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"It's cataracts o'er me; in vain did I swim,"
200,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,For like a mere pebble with horrible sound
201,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,The force of the double stream twisted me round.
202,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
203,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"""But God in his mercy, for to him alone"
204,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"In the moment of danger I ever have clung,"
205,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,Did bear me towards a projection of stone:
206,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"I seized it in transport, and round it I hung,"
207,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"The goblet lay too on a corally ledge,"
208,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,Which jutted just over the cataract's edge.
209,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
210,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"""And then I look'd downward, and horribly deep,"
211,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"And twinkling sheen in the darkness below,"
212,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"And though to the hearing it ever might sleep,"
213,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"Yet still the eye clouded with terror might know,"
214,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"That serpents and creatures that made my blood cool,"
215,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,Were swimming and splashing about in the pool.
216,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
217,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"""Ball'd up to a mass, in a moment uncoil'd,"
218,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"They rose, and again disappear'd in the dark,"
219,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,And down in the billows which over them boil'd
220,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,I saw a behemoth contend with a shark;
221,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,The sounds of their hideous duel awaken
222,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"The black-bellied whale, and the slumbering craken."
223,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
224,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"""Still, still did I linger forlorn, and oppress'd"
225,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,With a feeling of terror that curdled my blood;
226,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,Ah think of a human and sensible breast
227,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,Enclosed with the hideous shapes of the flood;
228,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"Still, still did I linger, but far from the reach"
229,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,Of those that I knew would await on the beach.
230,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
231,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"""Methought that a serpent towards me did creep,"
232,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"And trailing behind him whole fathoms of length,"
233,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,He open'd his jaws; and I dropp'd from the steep
234,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,Round which I had clung with expiring strength:
235,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"'Twas well that I did so, the stream bore me up,"
236,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"And here is thy servant, and there is the cup."""
237,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
238,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"He then was retiring, a look from the King"
239,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"Detain'd him: ""My hero, the cup is thine own,"
240,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"'Tis richly thy meed, but I'll give thee this ring,"
241,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"Beset with a diamond and chrysolite stone,"
242,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"If again thou wilt dive, and discover to me"
243,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"What's hid in the deepest abyss of the sea."""
244,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
245,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"The daughter heard that with compassionate thought,"
246,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"Quick, quick to the feet of the monarch she flew:"
247,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"""O father, desist from this horrible sport,"
248,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"He has done what no other would venture to do,"
249,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"If the life of a creature thou fain must destroy,"
250,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"Let a noble take place of this generous boy."""
251,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
252,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"The monarch has taken the cup in his hand,"
253,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,And tumbled it down in the bellowing sea:
254,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"""And if thou canst bring it again to the strand,"
255,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"The first, and the best of my knights thou shalt be;"
256,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"If that will not tempt thee, this maid thou shalt wed,"
257,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"And share as a husband the joys of her bed."""
258,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
259,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"Then the pride of old Eirin arose in his look,"
260,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"And it flash'd from his eye-balls courageously keen,"
261,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"One glance on the beautiful vision he took,"
262,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"And he saw her change colour, and sink on the green."
263,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"""By the stool of Saint Peter the prize I'll obtain;"""
264,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"He shouted, and instantly dived in the main."
265,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
266,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"The waters sunk down, and a thundering peal"
267,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,Announced that the time of their sojourn was o'er;
268,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"Each eye is cast downward in terrified zeal,"
269,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,As forth from the tunnel the cataracts pour.
270,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,"The waters rush up, and the waters subside;"
271,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,But ah! the bold diver remains in the tide.
272,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
273,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
274,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
275,A BALLAD TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN,
276,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS
277,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
278,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
279,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"Dame Ingeborg three brave brothers could boast,"
280,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,For the crown of Sweden their lives they lost.
281,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
282,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"The nobles to Sweden would fain away,"
283,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,Dame Ingeborg bade them at home to stay.
284,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
285,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"Dame Ingeborg stood at Helsingborg's gate,"
286,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""Dear brothers, go not, I beg and entreat!"""
287,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
288,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,Then with one voice the brothers cried:
289,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""We've long for our realms paternal sighed."
290,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
291,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""And we have too long with thee remained,"
292,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"Our hearts within us are sorely pained."""
293,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
294,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""Five days with me, dear brothers, wait,"
295,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,Whilst I my dreadful dream relate.
296,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
297,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""Methought that your mantles were of lead,"
298,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"With them, dear brothers, ye were arrayed."
299,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
300,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""They were fast tied about your throats,"
301,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"And treachery towards ye that denotes."""
302,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
303,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"To Dame Ingeborg's rede no ear they lent,"
304,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,But to Sweden that very same day they went.
305,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
306,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"And when they had won to the sand beach white,"
307,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"There met them Brouk, that faithless knight."
308,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
309,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""Ye brothers both, thrice welcome be,"
310,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"Ye'll come and drink Yule with His Majesty?"""
311,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
312,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"The nobles repair to Nykoping street,"
313,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,There they a deceitful counsel meet.
314,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
315,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""Now off your bodies your armour lay,"
316,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"And hie to the castle in court dress gay."""
317,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
318,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"In at the doorway the nobles stepped,"
319,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,Up to receive them the monarch leapt.
320,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
321,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""My dear brothers both, thrice welcome be,"
322,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"Will ye drink Yule with our Majesty?"""
323,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
324,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"With his brothers down sate King Byrge to food,"
325,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,Much serious discourse betwixt them ensued.
326,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
327,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""Now welcome, my brothers, thrice welcome I say,"
328,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"May I not alone the country sway?"""
329,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
330,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""May God to our brother grant happiness,"
331,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"But he cannot alone the land to possess."""
332,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
333,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"The nobles they ate and they drank for a trice,"
334,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,Brouk has discovered another device:
335,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
336,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""What will ye now do, ye worshipful knights,"
337,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"Have drinking and dancing for ye delights?"""
338,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
339,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"Then they danced out and danced in with glee,"
340,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,And Brouk the clear wine poured so free.
341,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
342,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"On the floor stood the nobles and 'gan to sing,"
343,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,Whilst Brouk proceeded to plot with the King.
344,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
345,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,Then unto his brother Duke Valdemar said:
346,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""O Erik, we drink too much wine, I'm afraid."
347,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
348,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""Be we on our guard 'gainst Brouk's pleasantries,"
349,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"He knoweth all manner of villanies."""
350,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
351,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,Duke Erik held up his good right hand:
352,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""Shall we fear aught in our fatherland?"
353,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
354,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""We are come with a safety assurance fair,"
355,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"And of no quarrel are we aware."""
356,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
357,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"They drank and they danced till the day had ta'en flight,"
358,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,Then illumined was torch and big wax light.
359,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
360,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"To hie now to bed the nobles desired,"
361,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,And repose on the bolsters their bodies tired.
362,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
363,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"Then in to the prison tower they were led,"
364,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,The King himself went in his cloak of red.
365,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
366,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"They thought that in jest the thing was done,"
367,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,'Till he slammed the doors to every one.
368,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
369,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"Manlike fought Erik and scorned to yield,"
370,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,As long as he'd sword or a post to wield.
371,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
372,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,Broke sword! broke post! they no more could defend!
373,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,Into prison they naked were forced to wend.
374,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
375,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"The noble brothers suffered sore,"
376,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,From frost and from cold and from hunger much more.
377,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
378,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""We'll give thee, Brouk, the gold so red,"
379,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"If thou'lt give us but water and bread."""
380,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
381,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""Ye shall not obtain in Sweden here,"
382,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"Or bread or water your hearts to cheer."""
383,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
384,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""Our dear brother's wife we are confident,"
385,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,To let us be starved will ne'er consent.
386,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
387,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""We know the Queen has a pitying breast,"
388,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,She will straw send us whereon to rest.
389,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
390,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""The hunger within us is sharp and strong,"
391,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"Our hearts must certainly burst ere long."""
392,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
393,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"Then Brouk at that word so wrathful grew,"
394,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,The keys he into the salt fiord threw.
395,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
396,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"Twas dismal to hear how with hunger they roared,"
397,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,Each others shoulders they devoured.
398,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
399,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"And there is yet more woe to relate,"
400,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,The flesh from the sides of each other they ate.
401,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
402,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"Much misery and woe there was that tide,"
403,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,In each other's arms the brothers died.
404,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
405,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"And thus things stood till five months were fled,"
406,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,King Byrge came home from the war-field red.
407,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
408,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""Now whither departed are brothers mine?"
409,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"Why didst thou not give them their fill of wine?"""
410,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
411,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,Then answered straight the little child:
412,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""Brouk into the tower the nobles beguiled."""
413,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
414,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"King Byrge peeped in the window through,"
415,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,The state of the brothers was piteous to view.
416,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
417,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""Now hear thou, Brouk, straight to me declare,"
418,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"Where the prison keys are I gave to thy care?"""
419,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
420,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""May the blessed Christ my soul ne'er save,"
421,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"If I cast them not in the briny wave."""
422,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
423,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""O Brouk, shame fall thy head upon,"
424,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,So evilly towards me thou has done.
425,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
426,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""Thou fool and villain!  I've lost thereby"
427,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"The keys to Sweden's sovereignty."""
428,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
429,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"""If I have betrayed thy brothers twain,"
430,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"Thou mayest alone over Sweden reign."""
431,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
432,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"That deed such grief to the Dukes' friends gave,"
433,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,And that grief they carried to the grave.
434,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
435,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"With his Queen King Byrge must fly from his throne,"
436,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"Beheaded was Magnus, his beautiful son."
437,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
438,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"But Brouk to the infamous wheel was consigned,"
439,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,May all such traitors a like end find!
440,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
441,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"When sovereigns many there are to a land,"
442,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,You'll never see them go hand in hand.
443,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
444,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"The one 'fore the other must certainly fall,"
445,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,Not seldom destruction comes o'er them all.
446,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
447,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,"Though fraud and deceit for a time have success,"
448,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,At length on their owner they'll bring distress.
449,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
450,KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS,
