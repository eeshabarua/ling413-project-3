372,NOTHING TO SAY.,"The talking to her, and have Nothing to Say."
373,NOTHING TO SAY.,"The lady had now been chattering so long,"
374,NOTHING TO SAY.,She felt that her voice was beginning to fail her;
375,NOTHING TO SAY.,"A punch would, she felt, be a blessing and boon,"
376,NOTHING TO SAY.,"The ""dientical"" thing with which to regale her,"
377,NOTHING TO SAY.,"So they pushed their way through the gathering throng,"
378,NOTHING TO SAY.,And hurried away to Taylor's Saloon.

384,NOTHING TO SAY.,"Who this queer-looking couple could possibly be,--"
385,NOTHING TO SAY.,"Asking each other in whispers, whether,"
386,NOTHING TO SAY.,"It wasn't the likeliest thing that she,"
387,NOTHING TO SAY.,"Was a Western Actress, and he an Editor;"
388,NOTHING TO SAY.,"And some were terribly frightened, because"
389,NOTHING TO SAY.,"They couldn't help thinking there certainly was,"

394,NOTHING TO SAY.,"But the strangers composedly sat, never heeding"
395,NOTHING TO SAY.,"These stupid remarks, or taking offence,"
396,NOTHING TO SAY.,"And they quietly kept on their drinking and feeding,"
397,NOTHING TO SAY.,Without the slightest regard to expense.
398,NOTHING TO SAY.,"If an appetite sharp is a thing so delightful,"

409,NOTHING TO SAY.,"While she coolly remarked, with a Camille cough,"
410,NOTHING TO SAY.,That the North Pole was only a half a mile off.

414,NOTHING TO SAY.,"How it was they got to their present location,"
415,NOTHING TO SAY.,"I'm sure I don't know, and it's not my vocation"
416,NOTHING TO SAY.,To give the details of their quick locomotion.
417,NOTHING TO SAY.,"Electricity may have done it, or steam;"

421,NOTHING TO SAY.,But motive powers are not my theme.

426,NOTHING TO SAY.,"The man had too much of ""cold without,"""
427,NOTHING TO SAY.,And the lady sighed for her tippet and muff;
428,NOTHING TO SAY.,"For though they had come by a summary route,"
429,NOTHING TO SAY.,"The weather, they found, was wintry enough."
430,NOTHING TO SAY.,"When they climbed an iceberg's loftiest height,"
431,NOTHING TO SAY.,"To the imminent danger of dresses and hoops,"
432,NOTHING TO SAY.,"Of ribbons and pins, and laces and loops,"
433,NOTHING TO SAY.,The GRINNELL EXPEDITION was in sight.

440,NOTHING TO SAY.,"For the wind and the weather, conspiring together,"
441,NOTHING TO SAY.,"Turned out to be, altogether too much for her;"
442,NOTHING TO SAY.,"One half she forgot, and she bungled the rest of it,"
443,NOTHING TO SAY.,Though I finally managed to pick out the best of it.
444,NOTHING TO SAY.,"She asked her companion, who stood in the lee of her,"
445,NOTHING TO SAY.,"For the wind spread her skirts to the bigness of three of her,"
446,NOTHING TO SAY.,"""Who sent these ships to the rescue of those,"
447,NOTHING TO SAY.,Who have perilled their lives in these Northern snows?
448,NOTHING TO SAY.,"Did he spring from the mob, the benevolent 'masses,'"

451,NOTHING TO SAY.,"Which I couldn't exactly make out the sense of,"
452,NOTHING TO SAY.,"For I know that her sentences ""failed to connect;"""
453,NOTHING TO SAY.,And I suppose that her chattering teeth bit the ends off;
454,NOTHING TO SAY.,"But 'twas very conclusive, whatever she said."
455,NOTHING TO SAY.,"He never disputed her; never said nay,"
456,NOTHING TO SAY.,But only hung down his discomfited head;
457,NOTHING TO SAY.,"And whatever he thought, he had Nothing to Say."

468,NOTHING TO SAY.,"They hastened back to Broadway, when she said,"
469,NOTHING TO SAY.,"That one more journey that night she'd lead him,"
470,NOTHING TO SAY.,Before she'd let him go home to bed.
471,NOTHING TO SAY.,"And he, not caring to quibble or question,"
472,NOTHING TO SAY.,"At once fell in with the lady's suggestion,"

486,NOTHING TO SAY.,"But men from the Northern cities were there,"
487,NOTHING TO SAY.,"Nursing the sick with the tenderest care,"
488,NOTHING TO SAY.,"Whose kindred had fled to less dangerous lands,"
489,NOTHING TO SAY.,Leaving the dying to strangers' hands.

493,NOTHING TO SAY.,While the two stood quiet beside the bed
494,NOTHING TO SAY.,"Of a patient sufferer, Charity said:"
