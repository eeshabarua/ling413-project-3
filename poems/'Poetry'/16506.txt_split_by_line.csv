56,INTRODUCTION,
57,INTRODUCTION,"We remember Samuel Wesley (1662-1735), if at all, as the father of a great"
58,INTRODUCTION,religious leader. In his own time he was known to many as a poet and a
59,INTRODUCTION,writer of controversial prose. His poetic career began in 1685 with the
60,INTRODUCTION,"publication of _Maggots_, a collection of juvenile verses on trivial"
61,INTRODUCTION,"subjects, the preface to which, a frothy concoction, apologizes to the"
62,INTRODUCTION,"reader because the book is neither grave nor gay. The first poem, ""On a"
63,INTRODUCTION,"Maggot,"" is composed in hudibrastics, with a diction obviously Butlerian,"
64,INTRODUCTION,and it is followed by facetious poetic dialogues and by Pindarics of the
65,INTRODUCTION,"Cowleian sort but on such subjects as ""On the Grunting of a Hog."" In 1688"
66,INTRODUCTION,"Wesley took his B.A. at Exeter College, Oxford, following which he became"
67,INTRODUCTION,"a naval chaplain and, in 1690, rector of South Ormsby; he became rector of"
68,INTRODUCTION,Epworth in 1695. During the run of the _Athenian Gazette_ (1691-1697)
69,INTRODUCTION,"he joined with Richard Sault and John Norris in assisting John Dunton, the"
70,INTRODUCTION,"promoter of the undertaking. His second venture in poetry, the _Life of"
71,INTRODUCTION,"Our Blessed Lord and Saviour_, an epic largely in heroic couplets with"
72,INTRODUCTION,"a prefatory discourse on heroic poetry, appeared in 1693, was reissued in"
73,INTRODUCTION,"1694, and was honored with a second edition in 1697. In 1695 he dutifully"
74,INTRODUCTION,"came forward with _Elegies_, lamenting the deaths of Queen Mary and"
75,INTRODUCTION,Archbishop Tillotson. _An Epistle to a Friend concerning Poetry_
76,INTRODUCTION,"(1700) was followed by at least four other volumes of verse, the last of"
77,INTRODUCTION,which was issued in 1717. His poetry appears to have had readers on a
78,INTRODUCTION,"certain level, but it stirred up little pleasure among wits, writers, or"
79,INTRODUCTION,critics. Judith Drake confessed that she was lulled to sleep by
80,INTRODUCTION,"Blackmore's _Prince Arthur_ and by Wesley's ""heroics"" (_Essay in"
81,INTRODUCTION,"Defence of the Female Sex_, 1696, p. 50). And he was satirized as a"
82,INTRODUCTION,"mare poetaster in Garth's _Dispensary_, in Swift's _The Battle of"
83,INTRODUCTION,"the Books_, and in the earliest issues of the _Dunciad_. Nobody"
84,INTRODUCTION,today would care to defend his poetry for its esthetic merits.
85,INTRODUCTION,
86,INTRODUCTION,For a few years in the early eighteenth century Wesley found himself in
87,INTRODUCTION,"the vortex of controversy. Brought up in the dissenting tradition, he had"
88,INTRODUCTION,"swerved into conformity at some point during the 1680's, possibly under"
89,INTRODUCTION,"the influence of Tillotson, whom he greatly admired (cf. _Epistle to a"
90,INTRODUCTION,"Friend_, pp. 5-6). In 1702 there appeared his _Letter from a Country"
91,INTRODUCTION,Divine to his friend in London concerning the education of dissenters in
92,INTRODUCTION,"their private academies_, apparently written about 1693. This attack"
93,INTRODUCTION,"upon dissenting academies was published at an unfortunate time, when the"
94,INTRODUCTION,public mind was inflamed by the intolerance of overzealous churchmen.
95,INTRODUCTION,Wesley was furiously answered; he replied in _A Defence of a Letter_
96,INTRODUCTION,"(1704), and again in _A Reply to Mr. Palmer's Vindication_ (1707). It"
97,INTRODUCTION,is scarcely to Wesley's credit that in this quarrel he stood shoulder to
98,INTRODUCTION,"shoulder with that most hot-headed of all contemporary bigots, Henry"
99,INTRODUCTION,Sacheverell. His prominence in the controversy earned him the ironic
100,INTRODUCTION,"compliments of Defoe, who recalled that our ""Mighty Champion of this very"
101,INTRODUCTION,"High-Church Cause"" had once written a poem to satirize frenzied Tories"
102,INTRODUCTION,"(_Review_, II, no. 87, Sept. 22, 1705). About a week later Defoe,"
103,INTRODUCTION,having got wind of a collection being taken up for Wesley--who in
104,INTRODUCTION,consequence of a series of misfortunes was badly in debt--intimated that
105,INTRODUCTION,High-Church pamphleteering had turned out very profitably for both Lesley
106,INTRODUCTION,"and Wesley (Oct. 2, 1705). But in such snarling and bickering Wesley was"
107,INTRODUCTION,"out of his element, and he seems to have avoided future quarrels."
108,INTRODUCTION,
109,INTRODUCTION,His literary criticism is small in bulk. But though it is neither
110,INTRODUCTION,brilliant nor well written (Wesley apparently composed at a break-neck
111,INTRODUCTION,"clip), it is not without interest. Pope observed in 1730 that he was a"
112,INTRODUCTION,"""learned"" man (letter to Swift, in _Works_, ed. Elwin-Courthope, VII,"
113,INTRODUCTION,"184). The observation was correct, but it should be added that Wesley"
114,INTRODUCTION,"matured at the end of an age famous for its great learning, an age whose"
115,INTRODUCTION,most distinguished poet was so much the scholar that he appeared more the
116,INTRODUCTION,pedant than the gentleman to critics of the succeeding era; Wesley was not
117,INTRODUCTION,singular for erudition among his seventeenth-century contemporaries.
118,INTRODUCTION,
119,INTRODUCTION,"The ""Essay on Heroic Poetry,"" serving as Preface to _The Life of Our"
120,INTRODUCTION,"Blessed Lord and Saviour_, reveals something of its author's erudition."
121,INTRODUCTION,"Among the critics, he was familiar with Aristotle, Horace, Longinus,"
122,INTRODUCTION,"Dionysius of Halicarnasseus, Heinsius, Bochart, Balzac, Rapin, Le Bossu,"
123,INTRODUCTION,and Boileau. But this barely hints at the extent of his learning. In the
124,INTRODUCTION,notes on the poem itself the author displays an interest in classical
125,INTRODUCTION,"scholarship, Biblical commentary, ecclesiastical history, scientific"
126,INTRODUCTION,"inquiry, linguistics and philology, British antiquities, and research into"
127,INTRODUCTION,"the history, customs, architecture, and geography of the Holy Land; he"
128,INTRODUCTION,"shows, an intimate acquaintance with Grotius, Henry Hammond, Joseph Mede,"
129,INTRODUCTION,"Spanheim, Sherlock, Lightfoot, and Gregory, with Philo, Josephus, Fuller,"
130,INTRODUCTION,"Walker, Camden, and Kircher; and he shows an equal readiness to draw upon"
131,INTRODUCTION,Cudworth's _True Intellectual System_ and Boyle's new theories concerning
132,INTRODUCTION,the nature of light. In view of such a breadth of knowledge it is somewhat
133,INTRODUCTION,"surprising to find him quoting as extensively as he does in the ""Essay"""
134,INTRODUCTION,"from Le Bossu and Rapin, and apparently leaning heavily upon them."
135,INTRODUCTION,
136,INTRODUCTION,"The ""Essay"" was composed at a time when the prestige of Rymer and"
137,INTRODUCTION,"neo-Aristotelianism in England was already declining, and though Wesley"
138,INTRODUCTION,"expressed some admiration for Rapin and Le Bossu, he is by no means docile"
139,INTRODUCTION,"under their authority. Whatever the weight of authority, he says, ""I see"
140,INTRODUCTION,"no cause why Poetry should not be brought to the Test [of reason], as well"
141,INTRODUCTION,"as Divinity...."" As to the sacred example of Homer, who based his great"
142,INTRODUCTION,"epic on mythology, Wesley remarks, ""But this [mythology] being now"
143,INTRODUCTION,"antiquated, I cannot think we are oblig'd superstitiously to follow his"
144,INTRODUCTION,"Example, any more than to make Horses speak, as he does that of Achilles."""
145,INTRODUCTION,"To the question of the formidable Boileau, ""What Pleasure can it be to"
146,INTRODUCTION,"hear the howlings of repining Lucifer?"" our critic responds flippantly, ""I"
147,INTRODUCTION,think 'tis easier to answer than to find out what shew of Reason he had
148,INTRODUCTION,"for asking it, or why Lucifer mayn't howl as pleasantly as either"
149,INTRODUCTION,"Cerberus, or Enceladus."" Without hesitation or apology he takes issue with"
150,INTRODUCTION,Rapin's conception of Decorum in the epic. But Wesley is empiricist as
151,INTRODUCTION,"well as rationalist, and the judgment of authority can be upset by appeal"
152,INTRODUCTION,"to the court of experience. To Balzac's suggestion that, to avoid"
153,INTRODUCTION,"difficult and local proper names in poetry, generalized terms be used,"
154,INTRODUCTION,"such as _Ill-luck_ for the _Fates_ and the _Foul Fiend_ for _Lucifer_, our"
155,INTRODUCTION,"critic replies with jaunty irony, ""... and whether this wou'd not sound"
156,INTRODUCTION,"extreamly Heroical, I leave any Man to judge,"" and thus he dismisses the"
157,INTRODUCTION,"matter. Similarly, when Rapin objects to Tasso's mingling of lyric"
158,INTRODUCTION,"softness in the majesty of the epic, Wesley points out sharply that no man"
159,INTRODUCTION,"of taste will part with the fine scenes of tender love in Tasso, Dryden,"
160,INTRODUCTION,"Ovid, Ariosto, and Spenser ""for the sake of a fancied Regularity."" He had"
161,INTRODUCTION,"set out to defend the Biblical epic, the Christian epic, and the propriety"
162,INTRODUCTION,"of Christian machines in epic, and no rules or authority could deter him."
163,INTRODUCTION,As good an example as any of his independence of mind can be seen in a
164,INTRODUCTION,"note on Bk. I, apropos of the poet's use of obsolete words (_Life of Our"
165,INTRODUCTION,"Blessed Lord_, 1697, p. 27): it may be in vicious imitation of Milton and"
166,INTRODUCTION,"Spenser, he says in effect, but I have a fondness for old words, they"
167,INTRODUCTION,"please my ear, and that is all the reason I can give for employing them."
168,INTRODUCTION,
169,INTRODUCTION,Wesley's resistance to a strict application of authority and the rules
170,INTRODUCTION,grew partly out of the rationalistic and empirical temper of Englishmen in
171,INTRODUCTION,"his age, but it also sprang from his learning. From various sources he"
172,INTRODUCTION,drew the theory that Greek and Latin were but corrupted forms of ancient
173,INTRODUCTION,"Phoenician, and that the degeneracy of Greek and Latin in turn had"
174,INTRODUCTION,"produced all, or most, of the present European tongues (_ibid._, p. 354)."
175,INTRODUCTION,"In addition, he believed that the Greeks had derived some of their"
176,INTRODUCTION,"thought from older civilizations, and specifically that Plato had received"
177,INTRODUCTION,"many of his notions from the Jews (_ibid._, p. 230)--an idea which recalls"
178,INTRODUCTION,the argument that Dryden in _Religio Laici_ had employed against the
179,INTRODUCTION,"deists. Furthermore, he had, like many of his learned contemporaries, a"
180,INTRODUCTION,profound respect for Hebrew culture and the sublimity of the Hebrew
181,INTRODUCTION,"scriptures, going so far as to remark in the ""Essay on Heroic Poetry"" that"
182,INTRODUCTION,"""most, even of [the heathen poets'] best Fancies and Images, as well as"
183,INTRODUCTION,"Names, were borrow'd from the Antient Hebrew Poetry and Divinity."" In"
184,INTRODUCTION,"short, however faulty his particular conclusions, he had arrived at an"
185,INTRODUCTION,"historical viewpoint, from which it was no longer possible to regard the"
186,INTRODUCTION,classical standards--much less the standards of French critics--as having
187,INTRODUCTION,the holy sanction of Nature herself.
188,INTRODUCTION,
189,INTRODUCTION,Some light is shed on the literary tastes of his period by Wesley's two
190,INTRODUCTION,"essays here reproduced, which with a few exceptions were in accord with"
191,INTRODUCTION,the prevailing current. _The Life of Our Blessed Lord_ shows strongly
192,INTRODUCTION,the influence of Cowley's _Davideis_. Wesley's great admiration
193,INTRODUCTION,persisted after the tide had turned away from Cowley; and his liking for
194,INTRODUCTION,"the ""divine Herbert"" and for Crashaw represented the tastes of sober and"
195,INTRODUCTION,unfashionable readers. In spite of the fact that he professed unbounded
196,INTRODUCTION,"admiration for Homer as the greatest genius in nature, in practise he"
197,INTRODUCTION,"seemed more inclined to follow the lead of Cowley, Virgil, and Vida."
198,INTRODUCTION,"Although there was much in Ariosto that he enjoyed, he preferred Tasso;"
199,INTRODUCTION,"the irregularities in both, however, he felt bound to deplore. To"
200,INTRODUCTION,Spenser's _Faerie Queene_ he allowed extraordinary merit. If the plan
201,INTRODUCTION,"of it was noble, he thought, and the mark of a comprehensive genius, yet"
202,INTRODUCTION,"the action of the poem seemed confused. Nevertheless, like Prior later,"
203,INTRODUCTION,Wesley was inclined to suspend judgment on this point because the poem had
204,INTRODUCTION,"been left incomplete. To Spenser's ""thoughts"" he paid the highest tribute,"
205,INTRODUCTION,"and to his ""Expressions flowing natural and easie, with such a prodigious"
206,INTRODUCTION,"Poetical Copia as never any other must expect to enjoy."" Like most of the"
207,INTRODUCTION,"Augustans Wesley did not care greatly for _Paradise Regained_, but he"
208,INTRODUCTION,"partly atoned by his praise for _Paradise Lost_, which was an"
209,INTRODUCTION,"""original"" and therefore ""above the common Rules."" Though defective in its"
210,INTRODUCTION,"action, it was resplendent with sublime thoughts perhaps superior to any"
211,INTRODUCTION,"in Virgil or Homer, and full of incomparable and exquisitely moving"
212,INTRODUCTION,"passages. In spite of his belief that Milton's blank verse was a mistake,"
213,INTRODUCTION,"making for looseness and incorrectness, he borrowed lines and images from"
214,INTRODUCTION,"it, and in Bk. IV of _The Life of Our Blessed Lord_ he incorporated a"
215,INTRODUCTION,whole passage of Milton's blank verse in the midst of his heroic couplets.
216,INTRODUCTION,
217,INTRODUCTION,"Wesley's attitude toward Dryden deserves a moment's pause. In the ""Essay"
218,INTRODUCTION,"on Heroic Poetry"" he observed that a speech of Satan's in _Paradise"
219,INTRODUCTION,Lost_ is nearly equalled in Dryden's _State of Innocence_. Later
220,INTRODUCTION,in the same essay he credited a passage in Dryden's _King Arthur_
221,INTRODUCTION,with showing an improvement upon Tasso. There is no doubt as to his vast
222,INTRODUCTION,"respect for the greatest living poet, but his remarks do not indicate that"
223,INTRODUCTION,"he ranked Dryden with Virgil, Tasso, or Milton; for he recognized as well"
224,INTRODUCTION,as we that the power to embellish and to imitate successfully does not
225,INTRODUCTION,constitute the highest excellence in poetry. In the _Epistle to a
226,INTRODUCTION,"Friend_ he affirmed his admiration for Dryden's matchless style, his"
227,INTRODUCTION,"harmony, his lofty strains, his youthful fire, and even his wit--in the"
228,INTRODUCTION,"main, qualities of style and expression. But by 1700 Wesley had absorbed"
229,INTRODUCTION,enough of the new puritanism that was rising in England to qualify his
230,INTRODUCTION,"praise; now he deprecated the looseness and indecency of the poetry, and"
231,INTRODUCTION,called upon the poet to repent. One other point calls for comment.
232,INTRODUCTION,"Wesley's scheme for Christian machinery in the epic, as described in the"
233,INTRODUCTION,"""Essay on Heroic Poetry,"" is remarkably similar to Dryden's. Dryden's had"
234,INTRODUCTION,"appeared in the essay on satire prefaced to his translation of Juvenal,"
235,INTRODUCTION,"published late in October, 1692; Wesley's scheme appeared soon after June,"
236,INTRODUCTION,1693.
237,INTRODUCTION,
238,INTRODUCTION,The _Epistle to a Friend concerning Poetry_ is neither startling nor
239,INTRODUCTION,"contemptible; it has, in fact, much more to say than the rhymed treatises"
240,INTRODUCTION,on verse by Roscommon and Buckinghamshire. Its remarks on Genius are
241,INTRODUCTION,"fresh, though tantalizing in their brevity, and it defends the Moderns"
242,INTRODUCTION,with both neatness and energy. Much of its advice is cautious and
243,INTRODUCTION,commonplace--but such was the tradition of the poetical treatise on verse.
244,INTRODUCTION,"Appearing within two years of Collier's first attack upon the stage, it"
245,INTRODUCTION,"reinforces some of that worthy's contentions, but we are not aware of its"
246,INTRODUCTION,having had much effect.
247,INTRODUCTION,
248,INTRODUCTION,"The _Epistle to a Friend concerning Poetry_ is here reproduced, with"
249,INTRODUCTION,"permission, from the copy at Harvard. The ""Essay on Heroic Poetry"" is"
250,INTRODUCTION,"reproduced, with permission, from a copy of the 1697 edition of _The"
251,INTRODUCTION,"Life of Our Blessed Lord_ owned by the Henry E. Huntington Library, at"
252,INTRODUCTION,"San Marino, California. Our reproduction of the second item was made from"
253,INTRODUCTION,a typescript because the printing of the original lacks the size and
254,INTRODUCTION,clarity which are necessary for satisfactory results In lithoprinting. The
255,INTRODUCTION,typescript follows the original accurately except that italics (crazily
256,INTRODUCTION,"profuse in the 1697 edition) are omitted, the use of quotation marks is"
257,INTRODUCTION,"normalized, and three obvious typographical errors are silently emended."

1641,_LONDON_:,"not above One or Two of the Ancients, and hardly any of the Moderns, have"

1644,_LONDON_:,"into the Mind of a wise Man, without affrighting him, as being the most"
1645,_LONDON_:,perfect Piece of Work that Art can produce. That Author has many excellent
1646,_LONDON_:,Reflexions and Rules concerning it in his Discourse sur la Poetique; but
1647,_LONDON_:,Bossu is the first I've seen who has writ a just and perfect Tract
1648,_LONDON_:,"thereon, wherein he has in a clear and Scholastic Method amass'd together"
1649,_LONDON_:,"most that's to be found in Antiquity on that Subject, tho' chiefly keeping"
1650,_LONDON_:,"to the Observations of Aristotle, which he drew from Homer, and who seems"
1651,_LONDON_:,"the first that reduced Poetry to an Art. That Author defines Epic, ""An"
1652,_LONDON_:,"Artificial Discourse, in order to form the Manners by Instructions,"
1653,_LONDON_:,"disguis'd under the Allegories of some one important Action, recited in"
1654,_LONDON_:,"Verse, in a manner probable, diverting and admirable;"" which he thus"
1655,_LONDON_:,"himself abridges, ""'Tis a Fable, agreeably imitated on some important"
1656,_LONDON_:,"Action, recited in Verse in a manner that's probable and admirable;"" In"
1657,_LONDON_:,"which Definition are contain'd, as he afterwards explains it, the general"
1658,_LONDON_:,"Nature of Epic, and that double, Fable and Poem: The Matter, some one"
1659,_LONDON_:,"important Action probably feign'd and imitated: Its Form, Recitation or"
1660,_LONDON_:,"Narration: And lastly, its End, Instruction, which is aimed at in general"
1661,_LONDON_:,by the Moral of the Fable; and besides in the particular Manners of the
1662,_LONDON_:,Persons who make the most considerable Figure in the Work.
1663,_LONDON_:,
1664,_LONDON_:,"To begin with Fable, which he makes included in the general Nature or"
1665,_LONDON_:,"Essence of Epic. This, he says, is the most essential Part of it; ""That"
1666,_LONDON_:,some Fables and Allegories scatter'd up and down in a Poem don't suffice
1667,_LONDON_:,"to constitute Epic, if they are only the Ornaments, and not the very"
1668,_LONDON_:,"Foundation of it."" And again, ""That 'tis the very Fund and principal"
1669,_LONDON_:,"Action that ought to be Feign'd and Allegorical:"" For which reason he"
1670,_LONDON_:,"expresly excludes hence all simple Histories, as by Name, Lucan's"
1671,_LONDON_:,"Pharsalia, Silius Italicus's Punic War, and all true Actions of particular"
1672,_LONDON_:,"Persons, without Fable: And still more home; that 'tis not a Relation of"
1673,_LONDON_:,"the Actions of any Hero, to form the Manners by his Example, but on the"
1674,_LONDON_:,"contrary, a Discourse invented to form the Manners by the Relation of some"
1675,_LONDON_:,"one feign'd Action, design'd to please, under the borrow'd Name of some"
1676,_LONDON_:,"illustrious Person, of whom Choice is made after we have fram'd the Plan"
1677,_LONDON_:,of the Action which we design to attribute to him.
1678,_LONDON_:,
1679,_LONDON_:,"Nor indeed is Bossu singular in his Judgment on this Matter, there being"
1680,_LONDON_:,"few or none who have ever writ on the same Subject, but are of the same"
1681,_LONDON_:,"mind: For thus Boileau in his Art of Poetry,"

1687,_LONDON_:,
1688,_LONDON_:,"In the Narration of some great Design,"
1689,_LONDON_:,"Invention, Art, and Fable, all must join."
1690,_LONDON_:,
1691,_LONDON_:,"Rapin too gives his Vote on the same side, Rien n'est, says he, plus"
1692,_LONDON_:,"essentiel au Poem Epique, que la Fiction; and quotes Petronius to that"
1693,_LONDON_:,"purpose, Per ambages, Deorumque ministeria praecipitandus est Liber"
1694,_LONDON_:,Spiritus. Nor is't only the Moderns who are of this Opinion; for the
1695,_LONDON_:,"Iliads are call'd in Horace, Fabula qua Paridis, &c. And lastly, even"
1696,_LONDON_:,"Aristotle himself tells us, ""That Fable is the principal thing in an"
1697,_LONDON_:,"Heroic Poem; and, as it were, the very Soul of it."" [Greek: Archê kai oion"
1698,_LONDON_:,psychê.] And upon this occasion commends Homer for lying with the best
1699,_LONDON_:,Grace of any Man in the World: Authorities almost too big to admit any
1700,_LONDON_:,"Examination of their Reason, or Opposition to their Sentiments. However, I"
1701,_LONDON_:,"see no cause why Poetry should not be brought to the Test, as well as"
1702,_LONDON_:,"Divinity, or any more than the other, be believed on its own bare ipse"
1703,_LONDON_:,dixit.
1704,_LONDON_:,
1705,_LONDON_:,Let us therefore examine the Plan which they lay for a Work of this
1706,_LONDON_:,"Nature, and then we may be better able to guess at those Grounds and"
1707,_LONDON_:,Reasons on which they proceed.
1708,_LONDON_:,
1709,_LONDON_:,"In forming an Heroic-Poem, the first thing they tell us we ought to do, is"
1710,_LONDON_:,"to pitch on some Moral Truth, which we desire to enforce on our Reader, as"
1711,_LONDON_:,"the Foundation of the whole work. Thus Virgil, as Bossu observes,"
1712,_LONDON_:,designing to render the Roman People pleased and easie under the new
1713,_LONDON_:,"Government of Augustus, laid down this Maxim, as the Foundation of his"
1714,_LONDON_:,"Divine Æneis: ""That great and notable Changes of State are not"
1715,_LONDON_:,accomplished but by the Order and Will of God: That those who oppose
1716,_LONDON_:,"themselves against them are impious, and frequently punished as they"
1717,_LONDON_:,deserve; and that Heaven is not wanting to take that Hero always under its
1718,_LONDON_:,"particular Protection, whom it chuses for the Execution of such grand"
1719,_LONDON_:,"Designs."" This for the Moral Truth; we must then, he says, go on to lay"
1720,_LONDON_:,"the general Plan of the Fiction, which, together with that Verity, makes"
1721,_LONDON_:,the Fable and Soul of the Poem: And this he thinks Virgil did in this
1722,_LONDON_:,"manner, ""The Gods save a great Prince from the Ruines of his Country, and"
1723,_LONDON_:,"chuse him for the Preservation of Religion, and re-establishing a more"
1724,_LONDON_:,"glorious Empire than his former. The Hero is made a King, and arriving at"
1725,_LONDON_:,"his new Country, finds both God and Men dispos'd to receive him: But a"
1726,_LONDON_:,"neighbouring Prince, whose Eyes Ambition and Jealousie have closed against"
1727,_LONDON_:,"Justice and the Will of Heaven, opposes his Establishment, being assisted"
1728,_LONDON_:,by another King despoil'd of his Estate for his Cruelty and Wickedness.
1729,_LONDON_:,"Their Opposition, and the War on which this pious Prince is forc'd, render"
1730,_LONDON_:,"his Establishment more just by the Right of Conquest, and more glorious by"
1731,_LONDON_:,"his Victory and the Death of his Enemies."" These are his own Words, as any"
1732,_LONDON_:,"may see who are at the pains to consult him; nor can I help it, if either"
1733,_LONDON_:,Virgil or Bossu happen to be Prophets.
1734,_LONDON_:,
1735,_LONDON_:,"When the Poet has proceeded thus far, and as Bossu calls it, dress'd"
1736,_LONDON_:,"his Project, he's next to search in History or receiv'd Fable, for some"
1737,_LONDON_:,"Hero, whose Name he may borrow for his Work, and to whom he may suit his"
1738,_LONDON_:,"Persons. These are Bossu's Notions, and, indeed, very agreeable to"
1739,_LONDON_:,"Aristotle, who says, that Persons and Actions in this sort of Poetry must"
1740,_LONDON_:,"be feign'd, allegorical, and universal."
1741,_LONDON_:,
1742,_LONDON_:,This is the Platform they lay; and let's now see if we can discover the
1743,_LONDON_:,"Reasons whereon they found these Rules, being so unanimous for Fable"
1744,_LONDON_:,"rather than true History, as the Matter of an Heroic Poem; and, if I"
1745,_LONDON_:,"mistake not, these are some of the principal."
1746,_LONDON_:,
1747,_LONDON_:,1. Because they had observ'd the best Models of Heroic Poems were laid
1748,_LONDON_:,after this manner; the greatest part of the Action both in Homer and
1749,_LONDON_:,"Virgil being pure Fable. Homer beginning, and all the rest following his"
1750,_LONDON_:,Steps.
1751,_LONDON_:,
1752,_LONDON_:,"2. Because no single Hero, or true History, which the Ancients knew was"
1753,_LONDON_:,"sufficient, without Fable, to furnish Matter for an Epic Poem. History,"
1754,_LONDON_:,"says Aristotle, treats of particular Things as they really are; Poetry, as"
1755,_LONDON_:,they ought to be; and therefore he prefers Poetry as the more grave and
1756,_LONDON_:,more instructive; the Poets being forc'd to follow the same Methods with
1757,_LONDON_:,"their Kindred-Art, that of the Painters, and gather a great many Beauties"
1758,_LONDON_:,"together, out of 'em all, to steal one Venus."
1759,_LONDON_:,
1760,_LONDON_:,"3. A third Reason may be, because, supposing they should have found some"
1761,_LONDON_:,one Example from whence to enforce strongly any particular Point of
1762,_LONDON_:,"Morality, yet it would have miss'd those other Characters of Epic, most of"
1763,_LONDON_:,"its Agreeableness, and all its Power to raise Admiration. A chast"
1764,_LONDON_:,Historian must not go about to amuse his Reader with Machines; and a Poet
1765,_LONDON_:,"that would imitate him, must have been forc'd to thin his Stage"
1766,_LONDON_:,"accordingly, and disband all his glorious Train of Gods and Godesses,"
1767,_LONDON_:,which composes all that's admirable in his Work; according to that of
1768,_LONDON_:,Boileau; Chaque Virtue devient une divlnitie.
1769,_LONDON_:,
1770,_LONDON_:,"And these, if I mistake not, were the main Reasons on which the"
1771,_LONDON_:,foremention'd Rules were grounded. Let's now enquire into the Strength and
1772,_LONDON_:,"Validity of them: To begin with Homer, he wrote in that manner, because"
1773,_LONDON_:,"most of the ancient Eastern Learning, the Original of all others, was"
1774,_LONDON_:,"Mythology. But this being now antiquated, I cannot think we are oblig'd"
1775,_LONDON_:,"superstitiously to follow his Example, any more than to make Horses speak,"
1776,_LONDON_:,"as he does that of Achilles, 2. If a Poet lights on any single Hero, whose"
1777,_LONDON_:,true Actions and History are as important as any that Fable ever did or
1778,_LONDON_:,"can produce, I see no reason why he may not as well make use of him and"
1779,_LONDON_:,"his Example to form the Manners and enforce any Moral Truth, as seek for"
1780,_LONDON_:,"one in Fable for that purpose: Nay, he can scarce fail of persuading more"
1781,_LONDON_:,"strongly, because he has Truth it self; the other but the Image of Truth,"
1782,_LONDON_:,"especially if his History be, in the Third place, of it self diverting and"
1783,_LONDON_:,"admirable. If it has from its own Fund, and already made to his hand those"
1784,_LONDON_:,"Deorum Ministeria, which cost the Poet so much in the forming 'em out of"
1785,_LONDON_:,"his own Brain. Nor can we suppose Fiction it self pleases; no, 'tis the"
1786,_LONDON_:,"agreeable and the admirable, in the Dress of Truth; and such a Plan as"
1787,_LONDON_:,"this would effectually answer both the Ends of Poetry in general,"
1788,_LONDON_:,"delectari & monere, nay come up fuller to the End of Epic, which is"
1789,_LONDON_:,"agreeable Instruction; and thence it follows strongly, that a Poem written"
1790,_LONDON_:,"in such a manner, must, notwithstanding the foregoing Rules, be a true and"
1791,_LONDON_:,"proper Heroic Poem, especially if adorn'd with Poetical Colours and"
1792,_LONDON_:,Circumstances through the whole Body thereof.
1793,_LONDON_:,
1794,_LONDON_:,"Now that all this is not gratis dictum, I think I can prove, even from"
1795,_LONDON_:,"most of those very Authors I've already produc'd, as of the contrary"
1796,_LONDON_:,"Opinion; and that I can make it appear, Bossu goes too far in fixing Fable"
1797,_LONDON_:,as the Essential Fund and Soul of the principal Action in an Epic Poem. To
1798,_LONDON_:,"begin with Rapin, who has this Passage, sur la Poetique, Reflex. 5. La"
1799,_LONDON_:,"Poesie Heroique, &c. ""Heroique Poesie, according to Aristotle, is a"
1800,_LONDON_:,Picture or Imitation of an Heroic Action; and the Qualities of the Action
1801,_LONDON_:,"are, That it ought to be (among others) true, or at least, such as might"
1802,_LONDON_:,"pass for true;"" Thus he. And hence it follows, according to him and"
1803,_LONDON_:,"Aristotle, that the principal Action in Heroic, not only ought to pass for"
1804,_LONDON_:,"Truth, but may be really true: For Horace, he does indeed call the Iliads"
1805,_LONDON_:,a Fable; but then he does not oblige his Poet superstitiously to follow
1806,_LONDON_:,"Homer in every thing, owning that he sometimes doats as well as other Men:"
1807,_LONDON_:,"Further, this may, and I think does, refer rather to the Dress and Turn of"
1808,_LONDON_:,"the Action, than to the Bottom and Ground of his History, which there's at"
1809,_LONDON_:,"least as much, if not more reason to believe true than false: And in the"
1810,_LONDON_:,"same Sense may we take Petronius and Boileau; nay, if we don't take 'em"
1811,_LONDON_:,"thus, I can't tell whether there were ever such a thing as a true Heroic"
1812,_LONDON_:,"Poem in the World; not so much as the Fairy-Queen, Gondibert, or Orlando"
1813,_LONDON_:,Furioso; all which have Fable enough in 'em of any reason; but their
1814,_LONDON_:,"principal Actions might be still true, as we are sure was that of the best"
1815,_LONDON_:,Heroic that ever was written; (I need not say I mean Virgil) since few or
1816,_LONDON_:,"no Authors ever deny'd that there was such a Man as Æneas, or even that he"
1817,_LONDON_:,"came into Italy, built Cities there, and erected a Kingdom, which Tully"
1818,_LONDON_:,"mentions, as a generally receiv'd Tradition in those Parts, and which it"
1819,_LONDON_:,"seems he thought not frivolous, but true and solid; otherwise he'd scarce"
1820,_LONDON_:,have given it a place in his Argument for his Client. Of this Opinion too
1821,_LONDON_:,"seems Horace himself, in his Art of Poetry, namely, That there's no"
1822,_LONDON_:,"necessity of the principal Action's being feign'd; for his Direction is,"
1823,_LONDON_:,"""Aut famam sequere, aut sibi convenientia finge; Either follow Tradition"
1824,_LONDON_:,"or Fame, or else feign what's agreeable thereunto."" He makes not feigning"
1825,_LONDON_:,"essential to Heroic Action, but gives leave to follow Fame, who is not so"
1826,_LONDON_:,"great a Lyar, but that she is sometimes in the right. Nay, what if we"
1827,_LONDON_:,"should after all have Bossu himself on our side, which I'm mistaken if he"
1828,_LONDON_:,"be not; for these are his Expressions, Lib. 1. Cap. 7. Le Fiction, &c."
1829,_LONDON_:,"""The Fiction may be so disguis'd under the Verity of the History, that"
1830,_LONDON_:,"those who are ignorant of the Art of the Poet, may believe it not a"
1831,_LONDON_:,"Fiction; and to make the Disguisement well, he ought to search into"
1832,_LONDON_:,"History for the Names of some Persons, to whom such an Action has probably"
1833,_LONDON_:,"or truly happen'd, &c."" Hence 'tis evident, that according to Bossu's own"
1834,_LONDON_:,"Notion, the main Action may be true; which appears even from Aristotle"
1835,_LONDON_:,"himself, as quoted by him, 97. [Greek: Kan ara] &c. ""An Author is not less"
1836,_LONDON_:,"a Poet, because the Incidents he recites have truly happen'd; if so be"
1837,_LONDON_:,"that which happen'd had the appearance of Truth, and all that Art demands,"
1838,_LONDON_:,"and be really such as it ought to have been feign'd."" And this Bossu"
1839,_LONDON_:,"himself illustrates admirably well by an ingenious Simile; ""A Statuary,"""
1840,_LONDON_:,"says he, ""first forms his Design, Posture, Altitudes which he intends for"
1841,_LONDON_:,"his Image; but if he then lights on any precious Material, Agate, or such"
1842,_LONDON_:,"like, where the Figure, the Colours, and Veins will not be accommodated to"
1843,_LONDON_:,"all he design'd, he regulates his Design and Imagination according to his"
1844,_LONDON_:,"Matter; nor ought we to believe, at the same time, that these singular"
1845,_LONDON_:,"lucky Hits condemn the Justness of his Art."" From all which, I must leave"
1846,_LONDON_:,"it to the Reader, whether I han't sufficiently prov'd what I've"
1847,_LONDON_:,undertaken; that Fiction is not necessary to the principal Action of our
1848,_LONDON_:,"Heroic Poem; on which I've been something more large, not so much on my"
1849,_LONDON_:,own account; for 'tis indifferent to me by what Name any Man calls my
1850,_LONDON_:,"Poem, so it answers the great End of Epic, which is Instruction; but"
1851,_LONDON_:,because I've heard some Persons have been so conceited as to criticise on
1852,_LONDON_:,"our immortal Cowley for this very reason, and deny his Davideis the Honour"
1853,_LONDON_:,"of being an Heroic Poem, because the Subject thereof is a true History."
1854,_LONDON_:,
1855,_LONDON_:,"And here I should drop the Discourse of Fable, were there not another sort"
1856,_LONDON_:,"of Persons still to deal with, perhaps more importunate than the former:"
1857,_LONDON_:,"The first will not like a Piece unless 'tis all Fable, or at least the"
1858,_LONDON_:,"Foundation of it: These latter run into the contrary extreme, and seam"
1859,_LONDON_:,unwilling or afraid to admit anything of Fable in a Christian Poem; and as
1860,_LONDON_:,"Balzac in his Critics on Heinsius his Baptista, are frighted, as at some"
1861,_LONDON_:,"Magical Charm, if they find but one Word there which was made use of by"
1862,_LONDON_:,"the old Heathens; which, says he, (unluckily as things have since"
1863,_LONDON_:,"happened) is as preposterous as to see Turks wear Hats, and Frenchmen"
1864,_LONDON_:,"Turbants; the Flower-de-lis in the Musselmens Colours, or the Half-Moon on"
1865,_LONDON_:,"the Standard of France. He's, however, it must be granted, justly angry"
1866,_LONDON_:,"with Tasso, as Mr. Dryden since, for setting his Angels and Devils to"
1867,_LONDON_:,"stave and tail at one another; Alecto and Pluto on one side, and Gabriel"
1868,_LONDON_:,"and Raphael o' t'other; as well as with Sannazarius, for mingling Proteus"
1869,_LONDON_:,"and David, and calling the Muses and Nymphs to the Labour of the Blessed"
1870,_LONDON_:,"Virgin, Tho' the truth is, the Italian Poets seem more excusable, at least"
1871,_LONDON_:,"to a Papist, in this Case, than any other Nation, who parted with as"
1872,_LONDON_:,"little of their Idolatry as they could possibly, after they had kept it as"
1873,_LONDON_:,"long as they were able, making the Change very easie, and turning their"
1874,_LONDON_:,Pantheon into an All Saints; much like the good Fathers in the Spanish
1875,_LONDON_:,"Conquests in America, who suffer the Natives to keep their Old Idols, so"
1876,_LONDON_:,"they'll but pay for 'em, and get 'em christen'd; by this means making many"
1877,_LONDON_:,"a good Saint out of a very indifferent Devil. So far, I say, Balzac is"
1878,_LONDON_:,"undoubtedly in the right, that Christianity and Heathenism ought not to be"
1879,_LONDON_:,"confounded, nor the Pagan Gods mention'd, but as such, in Christian Poems."
1880,_LONDON_:,"Of which Boileau also says, ""They should not be Fill'd with the Fictions"
1881,_LONDON_:,"of Idolatry;"" tho' he tells us just before,"
1882,_LONDON_:,
1883,_LONDON_:,In vain have our mistaken Authors try'd
1884,_LONDON_:,Those ancient Ornaments to lay aside.
1885,_LONDON_:,
1886,_LONDON_:,"As tho' he were afraid lest all Poets shou'd be forc'd to turn Christians,"
1887,_LONDON_:,"and yet in the next Lines he thinks it full as bad,"
1888,_LONDON_:,
1889,_LONDON_:,"To fright the Reader in each Line with Hell,"
1890,_LONDON_:,"And talk of Satan, Ashtaroth and Bel."
1891,_LONDON_:,
1892,_LONDON_:,As tho' he'd have no Christian to be a Poet. And much at the same rate is
1893,_LONDON_:,"Monsieur Balzac very angry with Buchanan, for the same reason; nor will he"
1894,_LONDON_:,"by any means let us substitute Belzebub, Asmodeus, and Leviathan, in the"
1895,_LONDON_:,"room of Alecto, Tisiphone, and Megaera, which is, in his Opinion, perfect"
1896,_LONDON_:,"Pedantry and Affectation; and is extreamly afraid, lest any of those"
1897,_LONDON_:,Barbarous Hebrew Words should disfigure the purity of the Latin Tongue;
1898,_LONDON_:,"when surely he cou'd not but know, that this pure Latin Tongue it self,"
1899,_LONDON_:,"for which he's so much concerned, is nothing but the gradual Corruption or"
1900,_LONDON_:,Barbarizing of the Greek; as that of the Phonician and Hebrew before; and
1901,_LONDON_:,"the Italian, and his own French too, from the Latin afterwards, by the"
1902,_LONDON_:,adulterous mixture of 'tis hard to say how many Languages: So that between
1903,_LONDON_:,"'em, they'd make it impossible for a Christian Poet to write a good Heroic"
1904,_LONDON_:,"Poem, or even a Tragedy, on any, but profane Subjects; by taking away all"
1905,_LONDON_:,"the Machines, and therein whatever is admirable. No, says Balzac, instead"
1906,_LONDON_:,"of those hard Words and proper Names, Appellatives may be chosen, Words"
1907,_LONDON_:,"common to all People: As for example, Ill luck instead of the Fates, and"
1908,_LONDON_:,the Foul Fiend for Lucifer; and whether this wou'd not sound extreamly
1909,_LONDON_:,"Heroical, I leave any Man to judge: It being besides certain, that 'tis"
1910,_LONDON_:,"singulars and particulars which give an Air of Probability, and the main"
1911,_LONDON_:,"Life and Beauty to a Poem, especially of this Nature; without which it"
1912,_LONDON_:,"must of necessity sink and languish. However so much of Truth, I must"
1913,_LONDON_:,"confess, there is in what he says, that I verily believe Magor-missabib,"
1914,_LONDON_:,"or Mahershal-alhashbaz, wou'd scarce yoke decently in one of our"
1915,_LONDON_:,"Pentameters, but be near as unquiet and troublesome there, as a Mount"
1916,_LONDON_:,Orgueil it self. Nor can partiality so far blind my Judgment as not to be
1917,_LONDON_:,"my self almost frighted at second hearing of such a thundering Verse, as"
1918,_LONDON_:,"Belsamen Ashtaroth Baaltii Ba'al: Which seems as flat Conjuration, as"
1919,_LONDON_:,"Zinguebar, Oran, &c. tho' 'tis now too late to amend it. But then there"
1920,_LONDON_:,"are other Words or a more soft and treatable Cadence, even in the same"
1921,_LONDON_:,"Hebrew Language, especially when mollified by a Latin or Greek form, or"
1922,_LONDON_:,Termination; and such as these one may make use of and let others alone:
1923,_LONDON_:,"though neither is our bolder rougher Tongue so much affrighted at them, as"
1924,_LONDON_:,the French and Latin.
1925,_LONDON_:,
1926,_LONDON_:,"But Boileau pushes the Objection further, and wou'd make it bear against"
1927,_LONDON_:,"the Things as well as Words, persuading himself,"
1928,_LONDON_:,
1929,_LONDON_:,"Our God and Prophets that he sent,"
1930,_LONDON_:,Can't act like those the Poets did invent.
1931,_LONDON_:,
1932,_LONDON_:,"Tho' he too, is short in History, how excellent soever in Poetry. For"
1933,_LONDON_:,"first, the Heathen Poets did not invent the Names of their Gods and"
1934,_LONDON_:,"Heroes, but had 'em from Eastern Tradition, and the Phenician and Jewish"
1935,_LONDON_:,"Language, tho' deflected and disguis'd after the Greek and other Forms, as"
1936,_LONDON_:,"Josephus tells us, which the learned Bochart has proved invincibly; and I"
1937,_LONDON_:,"have made some Essay towards it, in my Sixth Book. Nay further, it seems"
1938,_LONDON_:,"plain to me, that most, even of their best Fancies and Images, as well as"
1939,_LONDON_:,"Names, were borrow'd from the Antient Hebrew Poetry and Divinity, as, were"
1940,_LONDON_:,"there room for't, I cou'd, I think, render more than probable, in all the"
1941,_LONDON_:,"most celebrated Strokes of Homer, moat of the Heathen Poetical Fables, and"
1942,_LONDON_:,"even in Hesiod's blind Theogonia. Their Gods or Devils, which you please,"
1943,_LONDON_:,were not near as Antient as the Hebrews. The Word Satan is as ancient as
1944,_LONDON_:,"Job; nor can they shew us a Pluto within a long while of him. Ashtaroth,"
1945,_LONDON_:,"and Astarte, are old enough to be Grandmothers to their Isis, or Venus,"
1946,_LONDON_:,"and Bel, of the same standing with Idolatry. Lawful it must certainly be,"
1947,_LONDON_:,"to use these very Heathen Gods in Christian, since they were us'd in"
1948,_LONDON_:,"sacred Hebrew Poetry, in due place, and in a due manner; Bel boweth down,"
1949,_LONDON_:,"Nebo stoopeth, says Isaiah. And what a noble Description has the same"
1950,_LONDON_:,Prophet of the Fall of Lucifer? Nor can I see why it may not be as
1951,_LONDON_:,"convenient and agreeable, as 'tis lawful to transplant 'em from Hebrew"
1952,_LONDON_:,"Poetry to our own, if we use 'em as they did. And then for Angels,"
1953,_LONDON_:,"Prophets, and Oracles, it wou'd be strange, if they shou'd not strike the"
1954,_LONDON_:,"Mind as agreeably when real and true, as the Daemons, or Oracles, or"
1955,_LONDON_:,"Prophets of the Heathens, form'd, as has been said, partly from mistaken"
1956,_LONDON_:,"Fragments, or Traditions of sacred Story, partly indeed from the Juggles"
1957,_LONDON_:,"of the Heathen Priests, and crafty Ambitious Daemons. On the whole, we"
1958,_LONDON_:,"have all the Advantages they had, and yet more than they, for Heroic"
1959,_LONDON_:,"Poetry in these matters. As for that Question of Boileau's, ""What Pleasure"
1960,_LONDON_:,"can it be to hear the howlings of repining Lucifer?"" I think 'tis easier"
1961,_LONDON_:,"to answer than to find out what shew of Reason he had for asking it, or"
1962,_LONDON_:,"why Lucifer mayn't howl as pleasantly as either Cerberus, or Enceladus."
1963,_LONDON_:,"And let any one read but his Speech, in Milton's Paradise, almost equall'd"
1964,_LONDON_:,"in Mr. Dryden's State of Innocence, and I'm mistaken if he's not of the"
1965,_LONDON_:,"same Mind; or if he be not, and it gives him no pleasure, I dare affirm"
1966,_LONDON_:,'tis for want of a true taste of what's really admirable.
1967,_LONDON_:,
1968,_LONDON_:,"But Boileau comes to a stronger Objection, both against the Names and use"
1969,_LONDON_:,"of these Daemons, by way of Machine, I mean, in Christian Poetry;"
1970,_LONDON_:,
1971,_LONDON_:,The Mysteries we Christians must believe
1972,_LONDON_:,Disdain such shifting Pageants to receive.
1973,_LONDON_:,
1974,_LONDON_:,"Thus has his Translator turn'd him; and taking it in that Sence, the"
1975,_LONDON_:,"meaning must be, that it disgraces Christianity, to mix its Mysteries with"
1976,_LONDON_:,"Stories of Daemons, Angels, &c. But sure it can never be any disgrace, to"
1977,_LONDON_:,"represent it really as it is, with the frequent Intervention of those"
1978,_LONDON_:,"invisible and powerful Agents, both good and evil, in the Affairs of"
1979,_LONDON_:,"Mankind, which our Saviour has both asserted and demonstrated in his"
1980,_LONDON_:,"Gospel, both by Theory and Practice: Whence we learn, that there are"
1981,_LONDON_:,"really vast numbers of these Spirits, some tempting, or tormenting, others"
1982,_LONDON_:,"guarding and protecting Mortals: Nay, a subordination too among them, and"
1983,_LONDON_:,"that they are always vigilant, some for our Destruction, others for our"
1984,_LONDON_:,"Preservation, and that, as it seems, of every individual Man; and if this"
1985,_LONDON_:,"be true in general, I'm sure 'tis probable In particular: Nor can it be"
1986,_LONDON_:,"any disgrace to Christianity, to apply general Probabilities to particular"
1987,_LONDON_:,"Cases, or to mention these Daemons in Poetry any more than in Divinity."
1988,_LONDON_:,
1989,_LONDON_:,"But indeed the Translator has here mended Boileau's Thought, or at least"
1990,_LONDON_:,"made it more plausible and defensible, tho he has miss'd his Sence; for"
1991,_LONDON_:,these are his Lines:
1992,_LONDON_:,
1993,_LONDON_:,De la foi d'une Christien les Mysteres terribles
1994,_LONDON_:,D' Ornemens egayés ne sont point susceptibles.
1995,_LONDON_:,
1996,_LONDON_:,"The plain English of which, I think is, ""That the terrible Mysteries of"
1997,_LONDON_:,"the Christian Faith, are not at all susceptible of these gayer Ornaments."""
1998,_LONDON_:,"I'll not be too Critical here, tho' methinks its but an odd sort of Gayety"
1999,_LONDON_:,"that's to be found in Tales of Hell; agreeable, I own, the most dreadful"
2000,_LONDON_:,"thing nay be, if well manag'd in Poetry, but he can hardly ever make 'em"
2001,_LONDON_:,"gay without a yery strong Catachresis. But tho' we let that pass, so must"
2002,_LONDON_:,"not what follows, wherein he further explains his Notion. L'Evangile,"
2003,_LONDON_:,&c.
2004,_LONDON_:,
2005,_LONDON_:,The Gospel offers nothing to our Thoughts
2006,_LONDON_:,But Penitence and Punishment for Faults.
2007,_LONDON_:,
2008,_LONDON_:,"To which it may be first said, that supposing this true, and the Gospel"
2009,_LONDON_:,"did present nothing else, yet why mayn't Angels be us'd in it, to warn"
2010,_LONDON_:,Sinners to that Repentance which we know they so much rejoyce in; or
2011,_LONDON_:,"Devils, to punish and torment the Guilty and Impious; as in the Case of"
2012,_LONDON_:,"Sceva's Son, and others. But yet further, as to the assertion it self,"
2013,_LONDON_:,"I know not what their Gospel offers, nor I believe are they better"
2014,_LONDON_:,acquainted with what ours does; but we are sure 'tis far enough from being
2015,_LONDON_:,"such a dismal melancholy thing as they represent it, since Immortality and"
2016,_LONDON_:,Life are brought to light therein. We know that it gives us the noblest
2017,_LONDON_:,"Examples, the most divine Law, the strongest, yet justest Passions, the"
2018,_LONDON_:,"most glorious Combats, and Friendships, and Sufferings, such as neither"
2019,_LONDON_:,History or Fable cou'd ever yet equal. It shews us a God really
2020,_LONDON_:,"Descending, disrob'd indeed of all his more dazling and insupportable"
2021,_LONDON_:,"Glories, as our Divine Herbert; but yet clothed with what has more of true"
2022,_LONDON_:,"Divinity, with Humility, and Charity, and Patience, and Meekness, and"
2023,_LONDON_:,"Innocence. Here's War, here's Love indeed; such as never was besides, or"
2024,_LONDON_:,"will be more. He lov'd our Dust and Clay, and even for us, single"
2025,_LONDON_:,"encounter'd all the Powers of Darkness, and yet more, his Almighty"
2026,_LONDON_:,"Father's anger. But I'll go no farther, lest the Reader should think I"
2027,_LONDON_:,"forget where I am. I must return to Boileau, whose strongest Objection is"
2028,_LONDON_:,"yet behind; Et de vos Fictions, &c."
2029,_LONDON_:,
2030,_LONDON_:,And mingling Falshood with those Mysteries
2031,_LONDON_:,Wou'd make our sacred Truths appear like Lies.
2032,_LONDON_:,
2033,_LONDON_:,"But I hope the Critic knew, that there is a fair difference between a mere"
2034,_LONDON_:,"Fiction, or Falshood, and an Instructive Parable or Fable, on one side, or"
2035,_LONDON_:,"a few more lively Poetical Colours on the other. To mingle Falshoods, or"
2036,_LONDON_:,"dull Legendary Fictions, without either Life or Soul in 'em, with our"
2037,_LONDON_:,"Saviour's Blessed Gospel, may make 'em, in some Sence, superiour to it:"
2038,_LONDON_:,This wou'd indeed incline an Italian to be of the same Faith with his
2039,_LONDON_:,"Countryman, that 'twas all Fabula Christi, in the worst Sence of the Word:"
2040,_LONDON_:,"But certainly expressing the Truth in Parables, and mingling these with"
2041,_LONDON_:,"the Mysteries of the Gospel, can't be thought to give it an Air of"
2042,_LONDON_:,"Fiction: nor dare any affirm it does so, without Blasphemy, since our"
2043,_LONDON_:,Saviour has so often done it. Nor only these but deeper Allegories are
2044,_LONDON_:,"thought to be made use of in the Christian Religion; for Example, the"
2045,_LONDON_:,"Throne and Temple of God in the Revelations, and the Description of the"
2046,_LONDON_:,"New Jerusalem, with all its Gates and Foundations of Sapphires and"
2047,_LONDON_:,"Emeralds, and that lovely Scheme of Trees and Rivers, worthy a Paradise:"
2048,_LONDON_:,"All this, I say, will scarcely be granted literal, and consequently must"
2049,_LONDON_:,"be all an Allegory; alluding partly to the Old Jewish Church and Temple,"
2050,_LONDON_:,partly to Ezekiel's Visionary Representation and Prophetical Paradise. Nor
2051,_LONDON_:,"can it, I think, be justly reckoned more criminal, where we have any great"
2052,_LONDON_:,"instructive Example, which has been real matter of Fact, to expatiate"
2053,_LONDON_:,thereon; adding suitable and proper Circumstances and Colours to the
2054,_LONDON_:,"whole, especially when the History it self is but succinctly Related, and"
2055,_LONDON_:,the Heads of things only left us. And this some great Man have thought was
2056,_LONDON_:,"the Method of the Holy Pen-man himself, whoever he were, in that lovely"
2057,_LONDON_:,"antient Poem of Job; which, that 't was at the bottom a real History, few"
2058,_LONDON_:,but Atheists deny; and yet 'tis thought some Circumstances might be
2059,_LONDON_:,"amplified in the account we have left us, particularly the long Speeches"
2060,_LONDON_:,between that Great Man and his Friends; tho' the main hinges of the
2061,_LONDON_:,"Relation, his Person, Character, and Losses, the malice of the Devil, the"
2062,_LONDON_:,"behaviour of his Wife and Friends, nay even the Substance of their"
2063,_LONDON_:,"Discourses, as well as of that between God and him, and the wonderful Turn"
2064,_LONDON_:,"of his Affairs soon after: All this might, and did, truly happen. Or, if"
2065,_LONDON_:,"any amplification should be here deny'd, does not the Divine however every"
2066,_LONDON_:,"day, Paraphrase and Expatiate upon the Words of his Text, inverting their"
2067,_LONDON_:,"Method as he sees occasion, and yet is still thought unblameable. All the"
2068,_LONDON_:,"difference is, that he delivers what's probable, as only probable; whereas"
2069,_LONDON_:,"the Nature of Poetry requires, that such probable Amplifications as these,"
2070,_LONDON_:,"be wrought into the main Action, in such a manner, as if they had really"
2071,_LONDON_:,"happen'd; and without this, a Man might Ryme long enough, but ne'er cou'd"
2072,_LONDON_:,"make a Poem, any more than this would have been one, had I begun with,"
2073,_LONDON_:,"Abraham begat Isaac, and so tagg'd on to the end of all the fourteen"
2074,_LONDON_:,"Generations, much as Nonnus has done with St. John, and yet often miss'd"
2075,_LONDON_:,"his Sence too, as Heinsius judges."
2076,_LONDON_:,
2077,_LONDON_:,"But enough of Fable, and of those who would either reduce all Heroic"
2078,_LONDON_:,"Poetry unto it, or absolutely banish it thence."
2079,_LONDON_:,
2080,_LONDON_:,"Next the Fable of Epics, the Poem is to be considered; which, after Bossu,"
2081,_LONDON_:,"is the other part of its general Nature, and shews the manner of handling"
2082,_LONDON_:,"it, comprehending Thoughts, Expressions and Verses; of which there need"
2083,_LONDON_:,"not much be said, since they are obvious to every Reader. The Thoughts"
2084,_LONDON_:,"must be clear and just, and noble, and the Diction or Expression suited to"
2085,_LONDON_:,"them. The chief Difficulty, as Rapin observes, is to keep up the Sublime,"
2086,_LONDON_:,"which Virgil has done admirably, even in the meanest Subjects; and which"
2087,_LONDON_:,Aristotle thinks may be best done by the judicious use of Metaphors. There
2088,_LONDON_:,"ought to meet, according to him, Proportion in the Design, Justness in the"
2089,_LONDON_:,"Thoughts, and Exactness in the Expression, to constitute an accomplish'd"
2090,_LONDON_:,"Heroic Poem; and the great Art of Thought and Expression lies in this,"
2091,_LONDON_:,"that they be natural and proper without Meanness, and sublime without a"
2092,_LONDON_:,vitious Swelling and Affectation.
2093,_LONDON_:,
2094,_LONDON_:,"The Matter is next in an Heroic Poem, which must be one important Action;"
2095,_LONDON_:,"it must be important, Res gestæ Regumque Ducumque, with Horace. ""It only"
2096,_LONDON_:,"speaks of Kings and Princes,"" says Rapin, by which he must mean that it"
2097,_LONDON_:,chiefly and principally turns upon them: for both Virgil and Homer have
2098,_LONDON_:,"occasion for Traitors, and Cryers, and Beggars, nay even Swineherds (in"
2099,_LONDON_:,"the Odysses), and yet still more, of whole Armies, which can't be all"
2100,_LONDON_:,"compos'd of Kings and Princes. However, the more there is of these lower"
2101,_LONDON_:,"Walks in the Plan of a Design, the less Heroic it must appear, even in the"
2102,_LONDON_:,"Hands of the greatest Genius in Nature. Such a Genius, I think, was"
2103,_LONDON_:,"Homer's, and yet the Truth of this Assertion will be plain to any who"
2104,_LONDON_:,"compares his Odysses with his Iliads; where he'll find, if 'tis not for"
2105,_LONDON_:,"want of Judgment, in the latter a very different Air from the former, in"
2106,_LONDON_:,"many places much more dead and languishing, and this which I have given,"
2107,_LONDON_:,"seems one probable Reason on't; not excluding that of Longinus, that Homer"
2108,_LONDON_:,"was then grown old, and besides too much of the Work was spent in"
2109,_LONDON_:,"Narration; to which may be added, that he here design'd a wise and prudent"
2110,_LONDON_:,"rather than a brave and fighting Hero, having wrought off most of the Edg"
2111,_LONDON_:,"and Fury of his Youthful Spirit and Fury in Achilles, as in Ulysses he"
2112,_LONDON_:,express'd more of Age and Judgment.
2113,_LONDON_:,
2114,_LONDON_:,"This Action must be one and uniform: the Painture of one Heroic Action,"
2115,_LONDON_:,"says Rapin from Aristotle. It must be, as Bossu from Horace, simplex"
2116,_LONDON_:,"duntaxat & unum, that is, the principal Action on which the whole Work"
2117,_LONDON_:,"moves ought to be one, otherwise the whole will be confus'd; tho' there"
2118,_LONDON_:,may be many Episodic Actions without making what Aristotle calls an
2119,_LONDON_:,"Episodic Poem, which is, where the Actions are not necessarily or not"
2120,_LONDON_:,"probably link'd to each other, and of such an irregular multiplication of"
2121,_LONDON_:,Actions and Incidents. Bossu instances very pleasantly in Statius's
2122,_LONDON_:,"Achilleid; but he tells us there's also a regular and just Multiplication,"
2123,_LONDON_:,"without which 'twere impossible to find matter for so large a Poem, when"
2124,_LONDON_:,"as before it's so ordered that the Unity of the whole is not broken, and"
2125,_LONDON_:,consequently divers Incidents it has bound together are not to be
2126,_LONDON_:,"accounted different Actions and Fables, but only different Parts not"
2127,_LONDON_:,"finish'd, or entire of one Action or Fable entire or finished: and,"
2128,_LONDON_:,"agreeable to this Doctrine, Rapin blames Lucan's Episodes as too"
2129,_LONDON_:,"far-fetch'd, over-scholastic, and consisting purely of speculative"
2130,_LONDON_:,"Disputes on natural Causes whenever they came in his way, not being link'd"
2131,_LONDON_:,"with the main Action, nor flowing naturally from it, nor tending to its"
2132,_LONDON_:,Perfection.
2133,_LONDON_:,
2134,_LONDON_:,"And in this Action, the Poet ought, as Rapin tells us, to invert the"
2135,_LONDON_:,"natural Order of things, not to begin with his Hero in the Cradle, and"
2136,_LONDON_:,"write his Annals instead of an Epic Poem, as Statius in his Achilleid, the"
2137,_LONDON_:,"Reason of which seems plain, because this would look more like History"
2138,_LONDON_:,"than Poetry. It's more agreeable, more natural, in some Sence, to be here"
2139,_LONDON_:,"unnatural; to bring in, by way of Recitation or Narration, what was first"
2140,_LONDON_:,"in order of time, at some distance from that time when it really happened,"
2141,_LONDON_:,"which makes the whole look unlike a dull formal Story, and gives more"
2142,_LONDON_:,scope for handsome Turns and the Art of the writer. Another Reason why a
2143,_LONDON_:,"whole Life is not ordinarily a proper Subject for Epics, is, because many"
2144,_LONDON_:,trivial Accidents must be therein recited; but if a Life can be found in
2145,_LONDON_:,"which is nothing but what's diverting and wonderful, tending besides to"
2146,_LONDON_:,"the perfecting the main Action, and the Order of time revers'd in the"
2147,_LONDON_:,"whole, the Case would be so much altered, that I think their Rules would"
2148,_LONDON_:,not hold.
2149,_LONDON_:,
2150,_LONDON_:,"For the Form of Epic, which comes next in view, 'tis agreed on all Hands"
2151,_LONDON_:,"to be Recitation or Narration. Bossu says, The Persons are not at all to"
2152,_LONDON_:,"be introduced before the Eyes of the Spectators, acting by themselves"
2153,_LONDON_:,without the Poet; not that he'd hereby exclude the Poet from introducing
2154,_LONDON_:,"the persons telling their own Story, or some one of them that of the"
2155,_LONDON_:,principal Hero: for great part of Epic is thus far Dramatic. And thus
2156,_LONDON_:,"Virgil manages his second and third Books by way of Recitation, and that"
2157,_LONDON_:,"by his Hero himself, making him give Dido a long account of the Wars of"
2158,_LONDON_:,"Troy, and his own Actions, tho' thereby he falls into the Impropriety of"
2159,_LONDON_:,"commending himself, with a--sum pius Æneas. Vida takes the same way of"
2160,_LONDON_:,"Recitation, wherein he employs two or three of his six Books; and Milton"
2161,_LONDON_:,"follows them both, tho' less naturally than either; for he introduces our"
2162,_LONDON_:,"Saviour, in his Paradise regain'd, repeating a great part of his own Life"
2163,_LONDON_:,"in Soliloquy, which way of Discourse includes, in a Wise Man especially,"
2164,_LONDON_:,"so much of Calmness and deep Reflection, that it seems improper for the"
2165,_LONDON_:,"great and noble Turn required in such a Work, unless in describing a"
2166,_LONDON_:,"Passion, where it may be more lively. All that they mean by not"
2167,_LONDON_:,"introducing the Parties, is not doing it as in a Tragedy: they are not to"
2168,_LONDON_:,"be brought in abruptly to tell their own Tale from the beginning, without"
2169,_LONDON_:,"the appearing Help of the Poet, as Actors in a true and proper Drama. And"
2170,_LONDON_:,"this Narration, says Rapin, should be simple and natural; but the greatest"
2171,_LONDON_:,"difficulty is, not to let its Simplicity appear, lest it thence grow"
2172,_LONDON_:,"disagreeable, and the chiefest Art in this, consists in its Transitions,"
2173,_LONDON_:,"and all the delicate surprising Turns, which lead the Reader from one"
2174,_LONDON_:,"thing to another without his thinking whither he's going, or perceiving"
2175,_LONDON_:,"any Breach or so much as a passage between 'em; after all, the more Action"
2176,_LONDON_:,"there is in Epic, still the more Life there will be. A Poet may, I find,"
2177,_LONDON_:,easily fall into Poorness of Thought by aiming too much at the Probability
2178,_LONDON_:,and neglecting the Admirable; whereby he loses that agreeableness which is
2179,_LONDON_:,"a mixture of both. He ought then to take more care than some have done,"
2180,_LONDON_:,"not to keep himself too long behind the Scenes, and trust the Narration"
2181,_LONDON_:,"with another, which, without a great deal of Art and Pains, will take off"
2182,_LONDON_:,"much of the Life of the Work, as Longinus has already formerly observed."
2183,_LONDON_:,
2184,_LONDON_:,"And here come in the Qualities of Narration, mentioned in our Definition,"
2185,_LONDON_:,"that it ought to be done in a manner probable, agreeable, and admirable;"
2186,_LONDON_:,"'tis rendered probable by its Simplicity and Singularity, and admirable by"
2187,_LONDON_:,"the Grandeur of the Subject, the Figures and Machines, or [Greek: theoi"
2188,_LONDON_:,"apo mêchanês], much more lawful here than in the Drama's; and lastly"
2189,_LONDON_:,"agreeable, as has been said, by a mixture of both."
2190,_LONDON_:,
2191,_LONDON_:,"The last thing in our Definition, is, the End of Epic, indeed the first"
2192,_LONDON_:,"and principal which ought to be intended, and that's Instruction, not"
2193,_LONDON_:,"only, as Rapin thinks, of great Men, but of all, as in Virgil's Scheme,"
2194,_LONDON_:,"which we have already described; and, this either by the principal Moral"
2195,_LONDON_:,"aim'd at in the whole, or the Manners of particular Persons. Of Fable and"
2196,_LONDON_:,"Moral, I've already discours'd, and whether be the more lively and"
2197,_LONDON_:,"probable way to instruct, by that or History. But here it may be worth the"
2198,_LONDON_:,"while to enquire, whether the principal Hero in Epic ought to be virtuous?"
2199,_LONDON_:,"Bossu thinks not, the manners being formed as well by seeing Errors as"
2200,_LONDON_:,Beauties in the chief Actors; but yet methinks it seems too much to form a
2201,_LONDON_:,"Hero that's a perfect Almanzor, with not one spark of Vertue, and only"
2202,_LONDON_:,remarkable for his extraordinary Strength and little Brains; such was
2203,_LONDON_:,"certainly Homer's Achilles, of whom I think the Father was in the right"
2204,_LONDON_:,"when he observes, the Poet makes him not do one brave or virtuous Action,"
2205,_LONDON_:,"all the while he lies before the Town: whereas Virgil's Hero, is, to tell"
2206,_LONDON_:,"truth, an indifferent good Heathen, and, bating one or two slips, comes up"
2207,_LONDON_:,"pretty well to his own good word. The same however may be said for Homer,"
2208,_LONDON_:,which our present Dramatists plead for their Excuse; that he copied his
2209,_LONDON_:,Hero from those who were esteemed such in the barbarous Age in which he
2210,_LONDON_:,"liv'd,"
2211,_LONDON_:,
2212,_LONDON_:,"Impiger, iracundus, inexorabllis, acer,"
2213,_LONDON_:,"Jura neget sibi nata, &c."
2214,_LONDON_:,
2215,_LONDON_:,"Made up of Lewdness, Love, and Fighting: who, had he liv'd in our Days,"
2216,_LONDON_:,"would have made an excellent Town Bully, I wish there were not too much"
2217,_LONDON_:,"reason to say a modish Gentleman. But tho' old Homer took this way,"
2218,_LONDON_:,"Virgil, who writes with much more Judgment and Exactness, and follows him"
2219,_LONDON_:,"in many things, here thought fit to leave him; making his Hero, as I've"
2220,_LONDON_:,"said, not only brave and prudent, but for the most part virtuous. Which"
2221,_LONDON_:,"would much better form the manners of his Reader, than if they were set to"
2222,_LONDON_:,"spell out Instruction from contraries, as Homer has done. Whence it"
2223,_LONDON_:,"follows, the more virtuous a Hero is, the better; since he more"
2224,_LONDON_:,"effectually answers the true end of Epics. After all, Rapin says, the"
2225,_LONDON_:,chief Excellency of an Heroic Poem consists in the just proportion of the
2226,_LONDON_:,"Parts; that perfect Union, just Agreement, and admirable Relation, which"
2227,_LONDON_:,the Parts of this great Work bear one towards another; and blames Tasso
2228,_LONDON_:,"for mingling all the Sweetness and Delicacy of Eclogues and Lyricks, with"
2229,_LONDON_:,"the Force of an Heroic Poem. But I should think him mistaken here, and"
2230,_LONDON_:,that this is not the meaning of Aristotles [Greek: analogon]. For if we
2231,_LONDON_:,"allow not such a pleasing Variety, how shall we excuse even Virgil"
2232,_LONDON_:,"himself, who has his Dido, as well a Tasso his Armida and Erminia? nay,"
2233,_LONDON_:,"how shall we manage Love? which is usually one great Episode of Heroic, if"
2234,_LONDON_:,not with something of Delicacy. I grant Love ought to have a different Air
2235,_LONDON_:,in different sorts of Poems; but still if it be natural it must have
2236,_LONDON_:,"something of Softness; and for his Enchanted Forrest, which this severe"
2237,_LONDON_:,"Critic also blames, I believe there's few who read that part of his Work,"
2238,_LONDON_:,"who would willingly have it omitted, for the sake of a fancied Regularity,"
2239,_LONDON_:,any more than they would part with Mr. Dryden's Improvement on't in his
2240,_LONDON_:,"King Arthur. However, if it be a fault, 'tis strange so many who have been"
2241,_LONDON_:,Masters of the greatest Genius should unanimously fall into it; as Ovid in
2242,_LONDON_:,"his Palace of Circe, Ariosto in that of Alcina, and Spencer in his"
2243,_LONDON_:,"Acasia's Bower of Bliss, and several others, who have taken the same"
2244,_LONDON_:,Method. I should therefore rather think that this beautiful and marvellous
2245,_LONDON_:,"Analogy which Aristotle requires as the best thing in Epic, relates rather"
2246,_LONDON_:,to the Harmony and Agreement of the Parts with the Whole; so that there
2247,_LONDON_:,"appears no Fracture or Contradiction, the different Parts, tho' much"
2248,_LONDON_:,"unlike, yet all together making one beautiful Figure and uniform Variety."
2249,_LONDON_:,
2250,_LONDON_:,"And thus much of the Definition of Epic, containing the main Rules"
2251,_LONDON_:,"thereof, by which the Reader may be able to form a Judgment of this, or"
2252,_LONDON_:,any other Heroic Poem: Especially if to these Rules be added some Examples
2253,_LONDON_:,"to render them more plain. In order to which, I desire to express my"
2254,_LONDON_:,"Thoughts freely of other Poems, as I must expect every one will do of"
2255,_LONDON_:,"mine, always observing that piece of Justice, never to find fault, without"
2256,_LONDON_:,"taking notice of some Beauty to ballance it, and giving, where I can find"
2257,_LONDON_:,"it, the better Judgment of other Persons as well as my own. Concluding all"
2258,_LONDON_:,with a brief Account of my own Work.
2259,_LONDON_:,
2260,_LONDON_:,"To begin then with Grandsire Homer, this may be added to the particular"
2261,_LONDON_:,Remarks that have been already made. I think none will deny but the
2262,_LONDON_:,"Disposition of his Iliads, is so truly admirable, so regular, and exact,"
2263,_LONDON_:,"that one would be apt to think he wrote his Poem by Aristotle's Rules, and"
2264,_LONDON_:,"not Aristotle his Rules by his Poem. I confess, I once thought that he had"
2265,_LONDON_:,been oblig'd to his Commentators for most of the Beauties they celebrated
2266,_LONDON_:,"in him; but I am now, on a nearer view, so well satisfied to the contrary,"
2267,_LONDON_:,"that I can ne'er think his Poem writ by piece-meal, without any Connexion"
2268,_LONDON_:,or Dependance: wherein Dionysius the Halicarnassian very justly praises
2269,_LONDON_:,"the Order and Management of the Design, as well as the Grandeur and"
2270,_LONDON_:,"Magnificence of the Expression, and the sweet and passionate Movements."
2271,_LONDON_:,"Nor is it without Reason that Horace, Longinus, and all Antiquity have"
2272,_LONDON_:,"given him, as the Model of just and noble Sentiments and Expressions."
2273,_LONDON_:,I must confess there's something in his Numbers that strikes me more than
2274,_LONDON_:,"even Virgil's, his Thoughts and Expressions appear stronger than his, tho'"
2275,_LONDON_:,it cannot be denied but that Virgil's Design is much more regular. Rapin
2276,_LONDON_:,"says a great deal of that Prince of the Latin Poets, tho' indeed he can"
2277,_LONDON_:,"never say enough, ""He had an admirable Taste, says he, of what's natural,"
2278,_LONDON_:,"an excellent Judgment for the Order, and an incomparable Delicacy for the"
2279,_LONDON_:,"Number and Harmony of his Versification."" And adds, ""That the Design of"
2280,_LONDON_:,"the Poem is, if we consider it in all its Circumstances, the most"
2281,_LONDON_:,"judicious and best-laid that ever was or ever will be."" There is indeed a"
2282,_LONDON_:,"prodigious Variety in Virgil, and yet the same Soul visible in every Line."
2283,_LONDON_:,"His own great Spirit informs his Poetical World, and like that he speaks"
2284,_LONDON_:,"of,"
2285,_LONDON_:,
2286,_LONDON_:,---- totos infusa per Artus
2287,_LONDON_:,"Mens agitat Molem, & magno se corpora miscet."
2288,_LONDON_:,
2289,_LONDON_:,"He's soft with the height of Majesty, his Marcellus, his Dido, and, I"
2290,_LONDON_:,"think, above all, his Elegy on Pallas is very noble and tender. The joints"
2291,_LONDON_:,"so strong and exactly wrought, the Parts so proportionable, the Thoughts"
2292,_LONDON_:,"and Expression so great, the Complements so fine and just, that I could"
2293,_LONDON_:,"ne'er endure to read Statius, or any of the rest of the Antient Latins"
2294,_LONDON_:,after him; with whom therefore I shan't concern my self nor trouble my
2295,_LONDON_:,Reader. Ariosto was the first of the Moderns who attempted any thing like
2296,_LONDON_:,"an Heroic Poem, and has many great and beautiful Thoughts; but at the same"
2297,_LONDON_:,"time, 'tis true, as Balzac observes, that you can hardly tell whether he's"
2298,_LONDON_:,"a Christian or an Heathen, making God swear by Styx, and using all the"
2299,_LONDON_:,"Pagan Ornaments; his Fancy very often runs away with his Judgment, his"
2300,_LONDON_:,"Action is neither one nor simple, nor can you imagine what he drives at;"
2301,_LONDON_:,he has an hundred Hero's but you can't tell which he designs should be
2302,_LONDON_:,"chief: Orlando indeed seems a wild Imitation of Homer's Achilles, but his"
2303,_LONDON_:,Character is not bright enough to make him the Principal; and besides he
2304,_LONDON_:,"orders it so, that he does more great Actions when he's mad then when"
2305,_LONDON_:,"sober. Agreeable to this are Rapin's thoughts of him, which, in few words,"
2306,_LONDON_:,"are ""That he's elevated and admirable in his Expressions, his Descriptions"
2307,_LONDON_:,"fine, but that he wants Judgment; and speaks well, but thinks ill, and"
2308,_LONDON_:,"that tho' the Parts are handsome enough, yet the whole Work can by no"
2309,_LONDON_:,"means pass for an Epic Poem, he having never seen the Rules of Aristotle;"""
2310,_LONDON_:,"which he thinks Tasso had, and therefore wrote much better, whom he"
2311,_LONDON_:,"commends as more correct in his Design, more regular in the ordering his"
2312,_LONDON_:,"Fable, and more accomplish'd in all parts of his Poem than any other of"
2313,_LONDON_:,"the Italians, whom yet he justly blames, because he has two Hero's"
2314,_LONDON_:,"Godfredo and Rinaldo, of whom Godfredo seems the principal, and yet"
2315,_LONDON_:,Rinaldo performs the greatest part of the notable Actions. He seems to
2316,_LONDON_:,"imitate Agamemnon and Achilles, but then he raises his Agamemnon too high,"
2317,_LONDON_:,"or keeps him too low, for he hardly lets him do one great Action through"
2318,_LONDON_:,the whole Work. He further criticises upon him as mingling too much
2319,_LONDON_:,"Gallantry with his Poem, which, he thinks, is unbecoming the Gravity of"
2320,_LONDON_:,"his Subject. But whether this Censure be just, I know not, for Love and"
2321,_LONDON_:,"Gallantry runs through all Virgil's Æneids, in the Instances of Helen,"
2322,_LONDON_:,"Dido, and Lavinia, and indeed it gives so great a Life to Epic, that it"
2323,_LONDON_:,"hardly can be agreeable without it, and I question whether ever it has"
2324,_LONDON_:,"been so. Nor is he more just, I think, against Tasso's Episodes, which he"
2325,_LONDON_:,"blames as not proper to circumstantiate his principal Action, not entring"
2326,_LONDON_:,"into the Causes and Effects thereof, but seeking too much to please, tho'"
2327,_LONDON_:,"I think this Charge is unjust, for 'tis in his Episodes, if any where,"
2328,_LONDON_:,"that Tasso is admirable. I might here give several Instances, but shall,"
2329,_LONDON_:,"at present, only refer my Reader to that of Tancred and Erminia, and I'm"
2330,_LONDON_:,mistaken if he does not dissent from Rapin in this particular. Sannazarius
2331,_LONDON_:,and Vida were the next who did any thing remarkable in Epic; they both
2332,_LONDON_:,"writ in Latin on the same Subject, both Christian Heroics; Rapin says they"
2333,_LONDON_:,"both had a good Genius for Latin, the Purity of their Style being"
2334,_LONDON_:,"admirable, but that their ordering of the Fable has nothing in't of"
2335,_LONDON_:,"Delicacy, nor is the manner of their Writing proportionable to the dignity"
2336,_LONDON_:,"of the Subject. For Sannazarius he's indeed so faulty, that one can hardly"
2337,_LONDON_:,"with Patience read him, the whole Structure of his imperfect Piece, de"
2338,_LONDON_:,"partu, being built on Heathen Fable; yet he has great and vigorous"
2339,_LONDON_:,"Thoughts and very Poetical Expressions, tho' therein Vida far excels him,"
2340,_LONDON_:,"whose Thoughts are so noble, and the Air of his Stile so great, that the"
2341,_LONDON_:,"Elogy Balzac gives his Countryman Tasso, wou'd as well or rather better"
2342,_LONDON_:,"have fitted him; ""That Virgil is the Cause, Vida is not the first; and"
2343,_LONDON_:,"Vida, that Virgil is not alone."" It is true, as Rapin observes, that his"
2344,_LONDON_:,"Fable is very simple, and perhaps so much the better, considering the"
2345,_LONDON_:,"Subject; tho' he forgets not Poetical Ornaments, where there's occasion,"
2346,_LONDON_:,if he does not lean a little to Sannazarius's Error; for he talks of the
2347,_LONDON_:,"Gorgons and Sphinxes, the Centaurs and Hydra's and Chimera's, though much"
2348,_LONDON_:,more sparingly and modestly than the other. He has the happiest beginning
2349,_LONDON_:,"that perhaps is to be found in any Poem, and by mingling his Proposition"
2350,_LONDON_:,"and Invocation, has the advantage of placing one of the noblest Thoughts"
2351,_LONDON_:,"in the World in the first Line, without danger of falling into the"
2352,_LONDON_:,"absurdity of Horace's Author with his Fortunam Priami: For thus he sings,"
2353,_LONDON_:,
2354,_LONDON_:,"Qui mare, qui terras, qul coelum numine comples"
2355,_LONDON_:,"Spiritus alme, &c."
2356,_LONDON_:,
2357,_LONDON_:,"After the Invocation, in the very beginning of the Poem, he's preparing"
2358,_LONDON_:,the Incidents for his Hero's Death; he brings him to Jerusalem at the
2359,_LONDON_:,"Passover with Hosanna's; then raises his Machines, and falls to the"
2360,_LONDON_:,"Description of Hell. He through the whole, uses his Figures very"
2361,_LONDON_:,"gracefully; few have been more happy in Comparisons, more moving in"
2362,_LONDON_:,"Passion, succinct, yet full in Narration: Yet is he not without Faults; or"
2363,_LONDON_:,"in the second Book he brings him to his last Supper in the Garden, from"
2364,_LONDON_:,thence before Caiaphas and Pilate; which too much precipitates the main
2365,_LONDON_:,"Action: Besides, it seems harsh and improbable to bring in S. John, and"
2366,_LONDON_:,"Joseph, our Saviour's reputed Father, as he does in the Third and Fourth"
2367,_LONDON_:,"Book, giving Pilate an account of his Life; not to insist on the general"
2368,_LONDON_:,"Opinion, that Joseph was not then alive. But notwithstanding these few"
2369,_LONDON_:,"failures, it can't be deny'd, that his Description of our Saviour's"
2370,_LONDON_:,"Passion in the Fourth Book, is incomparably fine; the disturbance among"
2371,_LONDON_:,"the Angels on that occasion; his Character of Michael, and the Virgins"
2372,_LONDON_:,"Lamentation under the Cross, and at the Sepulchre, are inimitable. And"
2373,_LONDON_:,"thus much for Vida, on whom I've been more large because I've often made"
2374,_LONDON_:,use of his Thoughts in this following Work; his Poem being the most
2375,_LONDON_:,complete on that Subject I've ever seen or expect to see. And here han't
2376,_LONDON_:,"the English more reason to complain of Rapin, that he takes no notice of"
2377,_LONDON_:,"their Heroic Poems, than Lupez Viga of Tasso, for not mentioning the"
2378,_LONDON_:,"Spaniards at the Siege of Jerusalem: but since he has been so partial, as"
2379,_LONDON_:,"not to take any notice of our Writers, who sure as much deserve it as"
2380,_LONDON_:,"their Dubartas and Ronsard; we may have liberty to speak of our own, and"
2381,_LONDON_:,"to do 'em Justice: To begin with Spencer, who I think comes the nearest"
2382,_LONDON_:,"Ariosto of any other; he's almost as Irregular, but much more Natural and"
2383,_LONDON_:,"Lovely: But he's not only Irregular but Imperfect too, I mean, as to what"
2384,_LONDON_:,"he intended; and therefore we can't well imagine what it wou'd have been,"
2385,_LONDON_:,"had he liv'd to complete it. If Fable be the Essence of Epic, his Fairy"
2386,_LONDON_:,"Queen had certainly enough of that to give it that Name. He seems, by the"
2387,_LONDON_:,"account he gives of it to Sir Walter Rawleigh, to have design'd one"
2388,_LONDON_:,"Principal Hero King Arthur, and one main important Action bringing him to"
2389,_LONDON_:,"his Throne; but neither of these appear sufficiently distinct, or well"
2390,_LONDON_:,"defin'd, being both lost in the vast Seas of Matter which compose those"
2391,_LONDON_:,"Books which are finish'd. This however must be granted, the Design was"
2392,_LONDON_:,"Noble, and required such a comprehensive Genius as his, but to draw the"
2393,_LONDON_:,"first Sketch of it: And as the Design, so the Thoughts are also very"
2394,_LONDON_:,"great, the Expressions flowing natural and easie, with such a prodigious"
2395,_LONDON_:,Poetical Copia as never any other must expect to enjoy. Gondibert methinks
2396,_LONDON_:,"wants Life; the Style is rather stiff than Heroic, and has more of Statius"
2397,_LONDON_:,"than Virgil; one may see every where a great deal of Art, and Pains, and"
2398,_LONDON_:,"Regularity, even to a fault; nor is a Genius wanting, but it's so"
2399,_LONDON_:,"unnatural, that an ingenious Person may find much more pleasure in reading"
2400,_LONDON_:,"a worse Poet. Besides, his Stanza's often cramp the Sence, and injure many"
2401,_LONDON_:,a noble Thought and Passion. But Mr. Cowley's Davideis is the Medium
2402,_LONDON_:,"between both; it has Gondibert's Majesty without his stiffness, and"
2403,_LONDON_:,"something of Spencer's Sweetness and Variety, without his Irregularity:"
2404,_LONDON_:,"Indeed all his Works are so admirable, that another Cowley might well be"
2405,_LONDON_:,employ'd in giving them their just Elogy. His Hero is according to the
2406,_LONDON_:,"ancient Model, truly Poetical, a mixture of some Faults and greater"
2407,_LONDON_:,"Virtues. He had the advantage of both Love and Honour for his Episodes,"
2408,_LONDON_:,"nay, and Friendship too, and that the noblest in History. He had all the"
2409,_LONDON_:,"sacred History before him, and liberty to chuse where he pleased, either"
2410,_LONDON_:,"by Narration or Prophecy; nor has he, as far as he has gone, neglected any"
2411,_LONDON_:,advantage the Subject gave him. Its a great Loss to the World that he left
2412,_LONDON_:,"the Work unfinish'd, since now he's dead, its always like to continue so."
2413,_LONDON_:,"As for Milton's Paradise Lost its an Original, and indeed he seems rather"
2414,_LONDON_:,above the common Rules of Epic than ignorant of them. Its I'm sure a very
2415,_LONDON_:,"lovely Poem, by what ever Name it's call'd, and in it he has many Thoughts"
2416,_LONDON_:,"and Images, greater than perhaps any either in Virgil or Homer. The"
2417,_LONDON_:,"Foundation is true History, but the turn is Fable: The Action is very"
2418,_LONDON_:,"Important, but not uniform; for one can't tell which is the Principal in"
2419,_LONDON_:,"the Poem, the Wars of the Angels or the Fall of Man, nor which is the"
2420,_LONDON_:,"Chief Person Michael or Adam. Its true, the former comes in as an Episode"
2421,_LONDON_:,"to the latter, but it takes up too great a part thereof, because its"
2422,_LONDON_:,link'd to it. His Discourse of Light is incomparable; and I think 'twas
2423,_LONDON_:,worth the while to be blind to be its Author. His Description of Adam and
2424,_LONDON_:,"Eve, their Persons and Love, is almost too lively to bear reading: Not but"
2425,_LONDON_:,"that he has his inequalities and repetitions, the latter pretty often, as"
2426,_LONDON_:,"have, more or less, all other Poets but Virgil. For his antique Words I'm"
2427,_LONDON_:,"not like to blame him whoever does: And for his blank Verse, I'm of a"
2428,_LONDON_:,"different mind from most others, and think they rather excuse his"
2429,_LONDON_:,"uncorrectness than the contraries; for I find its easier to run into it,"
2430,_LONDON_:,"in that sort of Verse, than in Rhyming Works where the Thought is oftner"
2431,_LONDON_:,"turned; whereas here the Fancy flows on, without check or controul. As for"
2432,_LONDON_:,"his Paradise Regain'd, I nothing wonder that it has not near the Life of"
2433,_LONDON_:,"his former Poem, any more than the Odysses fell short of the Iliads."
2434,_LONDON_:,"Milton, when he writ this, was grown Older, probably poorer: He had not"
2435,_LONDON_:,"that scope for Fable, was confin'd to a lower Walk, and draws out that in"
2436,_LONDON_:,four Books which might have been well compriz'd in one: Notwithstanding
2437,_LONDON_:,"all this, there are many strokes which appear truly his; as the Mustring"
2438,_LONDON_:,"of the Parthian Troops, the Description of Rome by the Devil to our"
2439,_LONDON_:,"Saviour, and several other places."
2440,_LONDON_:,
2441,_LONDON_:,"And now I've done with all the rest, I may take liberty to say something"
2442,_LONDON_:,of my own.
2443,_LONDON_:,
2444,_LONDON_:,"For the Subject I dare stand by it, that 'tis fit for a better Heroic"
2445,_LONDON_:,"Poem than any ever was, or will be made; and that if a good Poem cou'd not"
2446,_LONDON_:,"be made on't, it must be either from the weakness of the Art itself, or"
2447,_LONDON_:,for want of a good Artist. I don't say the Subject with all its
2448,_LONDON_:,"Circumstances is the best for Epic, but considered in it self, or with a"
2449,_LONDON_:,prudent choice out of the vast Field of Matter which it affords.
2450,_LONDON_:,
2451,_LONDON_:,"The Action is Important, if ever any was, being no less than the"
2452,_LONDON_:,"Redemption of the World, which was not accomplish'd till after our"
2453,_LONDON_:,Saviours Death and Resurrection. The Ascension I confess should be left
2454,_LONDON_:,"out, according to the common Rules of Heroick Poetry, but I had not the"
2455,_LONDON_:,"same reason of omitting it, as others have for not coming to the End of"
2456,_LONDON_:,"their History, a little short of which they generally stop, because after"
2457,_LONDON_:,"the main Business is over, nothing great remains, or however not greater"
2458,_LONDON_:,"than has already past. And if any thing mean followed, the Reader wou'd"
2459,_LONDON_:,"leave off dissatisfied. But I've as great and remarkable an Action, as any"
2460,_LONDON_:,"in the whole story, yet upon my Hands, and which if I had omitted, I had"
2461,_LONDON_:,lost many very moving Incidents that follow'd the Resurrection; and
2462,_LONDON_:,"besides, Vida before me, has carry'd it yet further, to the actual Descent"
2463,_LONDON_:,"of the Holy Ghost on the Disciples, and the spreading the Christian Name"
2464,_LONDON_:,all the World over; which I have done only in Prophecy.
2465,_LONDON_:,
2466,_LONDON_:,"The Action is I think uniform, because all the Episodes are part of the"
2467,_LONDON_:,"main Action, the Redemption of the World; to which his Incarnation, and"
2468,_LONDON_:,"Divine Conception were absolutely necessary, and so were his Holy Life,"
2469,_LONDON_:,"Doctrine, Miracles, and especially his Sufferings and Agonies. My"
2470,_LONDON_:,"principal Hero was perfect, yet imitable, and that both in active and"
2471,_LONDON_:,"contemplative Life. He leaves his own Kingdom to save and conquer another,"
2472,_LONDON_:,"endures the greatest hardships, is reduc'd to the lowest ebb, nay is at"

2474,_LONDON_:,"Misfortunes, conquers all his Enemies, fixes Laws, establishes Religion,"
2475,_LONDON_:,"Peace, and his own Empire, and is advanced higher than any Conquerer ever"
2476,_LONDON_:,was before him.

2478,_LONDON_:,"The other Persons are Heroical enough, Angels, Kings, High Priests,"
2479,_LONDON_:,"Governours, Councellors, nay even the Apostles themselves were more than"
2480,_LONDON_:,"Kings, for they were thought and call'd Gods by the People. The Moral I"
2481,_LONDON_:,"find not make it, in a true Example, which others are forced to Form in"
2482,_LONDON_:,"Fable; ""That we ought to do Good, to suffer evil, submit to the Divine"
2483,_LONDON_:,"Will; to venture or lose a Life for a Friend; to forgive our Enemies."""
2484,_LONDON_:,
2485,_LONDON_:,Yet further I desire to recommend the whole of the Christian Religion; all
2486,_LONDON_:,the Articles of Faith; all that System of Divinity and Morality contain'd
2487,_LONDON_:,"in the Gospel of the Blessed Jesus, to the Study and Practice of Persons"
2488,_LONDON_:,"of Ingenuity and Reason; to make his Divine Person, which is already"
2489,_LONDON_:,"infinitely Amiable, if possible, actually more Ador'd and Lov'd; and to"
2490,_LONDON_:,"Vindicate his Mission, his Satisfaction, and his Divinity, against all"
2491,_LONDON_:,"Jews, Turks, Infidels, and Heretics; which sure are the most proper Ends"
2492,_LONDON_:,that can be propos'd in a Work of this Nature: Which may be agreeably and
2493,_LONDON_:,"admirably done, if 'tis not the Poets fault; for here's all the marvellous"
2494,_LONDON_:,"that cou'd be wished for, already done to my Hand, and all sacredly True,"
2495,_LONDON_:,"Angels and Demons, and Miracles, with Voices from Heaven."

2497,_LONDON_:,"Now the Subject being so fit for a good Heroic Poem, I shall have the less"
2498,_LONDON_:,"excuse, if this be a bad one. And here I must ingenuously confess, I had"
2499,_LONDON_:,"seen none of these Rules given by the Masters of Epic, when I laid the"
2500,_LONDON_:,"Scheme of this Poem, tho I wish I had, for I might probably then have done"
2501,_LONDON_:,"it better, or not at all. I knew not the hazard of the undertaking, but"
2502,_LONDON_:,"greedily embrac'd it, when first propos'd by some Friends, who were"
2503,_LONDON_:,"ignorant of what they put me upon. Being full of the Design wherein, the"
2504,_LONDON_:,"earnest desire I had to see it accomplish'd, and either a lucky Chance, or"
2505,_LONDON_:,"the Happiness of my Subject, may perhaps in some Instances, have supply'd"
2506,_LONDON_:,the want both of Rules and Genius. All I will say of my own performance
2507,_LONDON_:,"is, that I now know the Faults on't, tho I am not oblig'd to point 'em out"
2508,_LONDON_:,"to my Reader, who will but too soon find 'em. That I wou'd have mended"
2509,_LONDON_:,"much that's now amiss, had I lived in an Age where a man might afford to"
2510,_LONDON_:,"be Nine or Ten Years about a Poem. And in the Mean time this satisfies me,"
2511,_LONDON_:,"whatever is the success, that I've done all that cou'd be done by one in"
2512,_LONDON_:,my Circumstances towards the rendering it more compleat and free from
2513,_LONDON_:,"Faults, and only wish that my own Reputation may suffer, by the weakness"
2514,_LONDON_:,"of the Work, and not the Dignity of the Subject."
2515,_LONDON_:,
2516,_LONDON_:,"I cou'd plead for my self what Longinus says on Works of this Nature,"
2517,_LONDON_:,"wou'd it not look like Arrogance, ""That even the greatest Genius may"
2518,_LONDON_:,"sometimes sink into meanness, when the force of their Spirits is once"
2519,_LONDON_:,exhausted: That its very difficult for height of Thought to sustain it
2520,_LONDON_:,self long in an equal Tenour; and that some Faults ought to be excused
2521,_LONDON_:,"when there are more Beauties."" But if none of these will pass, I hope it"
2522,_LONDON_:,"will not much mortifie me, since I think the World and I have no great"
2523,_LONDON_:,matter to do with one another. I'm sensible my Poem wou'd have had fewer
2524,_LONDON_:,"Enemies, had I left out some Passages in't. But as mean as the worst of"
2525,_LONDON_:,"this are, I wou'd not buy their good Word at such a rate. I had almost"
2526,_LONDON_:,"forgot to mention the Gravers Work, which is not without Faults,"
2527,_LONDON_:,particularly he has err'd in the Posture of the Disciples at the last
2528,_LONDON_:,"Supper, whom he has made Sitting, when they were really Declining, or"
2529,_LONDON_:,"Discumbent. But its now more than time to conclude my long Preface, which"
2530,_LONDON_:,"I shall do in few Words. Since the chief Design in this Work, is to"
2531,_LONDON_:,"advance the Honour of my Hero, and next to that, the entertainment of"
2532,_LONDON_:,"Pious and ingenious Minds; for the truth of which, I hope I may appeal to"
2533,_LONDON_:,the great [Greek: kritikos tês kardias]; I shall not be much concern'd for
2534,_LONDON_:,the success it may meet with in the World.
