125,THE CHERRY TREE,
126,THE CHERRY TREE,_Come from your bed my drowsy gentleman!
127,THE CHERRY TREE,"And you, fair lady, rise and braid your hair,"
128,THE CHERRY TREE,"And let the children wash, if wash they can;"
129,THE CHERRY TREE,"If not, assist you them, and make them fair"
130,THE CHERRY TREE,"As is the morning and the morning sky,"
131,THE CHERRY TREE,And every tree and bush and bird in air._
132,THE CHERRY TREE,
133,THE CHERRY TREE,"_The sun climbed on the heights three hours ago,"
134,THE CHERRY TREE,He laughed above the hills and they were glad;
135,THE CHERRY TREE,With bubbled pearl he made the rivers flow
136,THE CHERRY TREE,"And laced their mists in silver, and he clad"
137,THE CHERRY TREE,"The meads in fragrant pomp of green and gold,"
138,THE CHERRY TREE,And bade the world forget it had been sad._
139,THE CHERRY TREE,
140,THE CHERRY TREE,"_So lift yourself, good sir! and you, sweet dame,"
141,THE CHERRY TREE,Unlash your evening eyes of pious grey;
142,THE CHERRY TREE,"Call on the children by each loved name,"
143,THE CHERRY TREE,And set them on the grass and let them play;
144,THE CHERRY TREE,"And play with them a while, and sing with them"
145,THE CHERRY TREE,Beneath the cherry bush a roundelay._

150,BREAKFAST TIME,BREAKFAST TIME
151,BREAKFAST TIME,
152,BREAKFAST TIME,The sun is always in the sky
153,BREAKFAST TIME,"Whenever I get out of bed,"
154,BREAKFAST TIME,And I often wonder why
155,BREAKFAST TIME,It's never late.--My sister said
156,BREAKFAST TIME,"She did not know who did the trick,"
157,BREAKFAST TIME,"And that she did not care a bit,"
158,BREAKFAST TIME,And I should eat my porridge quick.
159,BREAKFAST TIME,... I think it's mother wakens it.

164,IN THE ORCHARD,IN THE ORCHARD
165,IN THE ORCHARD,
166,IN THE ORCHARD,There was a giant by the Orchard Wall
167,IN THE ORCHARD,"Peeping about on this side and on that,"
168,IN THE ORCHARD,And feeling in the trees: he was as tall
169,IN THE ORCHARD,"As the big apple tree, and twice as fat:"
170,IN THE ORCHARD,"His beard was long, and bristly-black, and there"
171,IN THE ORCHARD,Were leaves and bits of grass stuck in his hair.
172,IN THE ORCHARD,
173,IN THE ORCHARD,"He held a great big club in his right hand,"
174,IN THE ORCHARD,And with the other felt in every tree
175,IN THE ORCHARD,For something that he wanted.  You could stand
176,IN THE ORCHARD,Beside him and not reach up to his knee
177,IN THE ORCHARD,So mighty big he was--I feared he would
178,IN THE ORCHARD,"Turn round, and trample down to where I stood."
179,IN THE ORCHARD,
180,IN THE ORCHARD,"I tried to get away, but, as I slid"
181,IN THE ORCHARD,"Under a bush, he saw me, and he bent"
182,IN THE ORCHARD,"Far down and said, ""_Where is the Princess hid?_"""
183,IN THE ORCHARD,"I pointed to a place, and off he went--"
184,IN THE ORCHARD,But while he searched I turned and simply flew
185,IN THE ORCHARD,Round by the lilac bushes back to you.
186,IN THE ORCHARD,
187,IN THE ORCHARD,
188,IN THE ORCHARD,
189,IN THE ORCHARD,
190,DAY AND NIGHT,DAY AND NIGHT
191,DAY AND NIGHT,
192,DAY AND NIGHT,When the bright eyes of the day
193,DAY AND NIGHT,"Open on the dusk, to see"
194,DAY AND NIGHT,Mist and shadow fade away
195,DAY AND NIGHT,"And the sun shine merrily,"
196,DAY AND NIGHT,Then I leave my bed and run
197,DAY AND NIGHT,Out to frolic in the sun.
198,DAY AND NIGHT,
199,DAY AND NIGHT,Through the sunny hours I play
200,DAY AND NIGHT,"Where the stream is wandering,"
201,DAY AND NIGHT,Plucking daisies by the way;
202,DAY AND NIGHT,"And I laugh and dance and sing,"
203,DAY AND NIGHT,While the birds fly here and there
204,DAY AND NIGHT,Singing on the sunny air.
205,DAY AND NIGHT,
206,DAY AND NIGHT,"When the night comes, cold and slow,"
207,DAY AND NIGHT,"And the sad moon walks the sky,"
208,DAY AND NIGHT,"When the whispering wind says ""_Boh,"
209,DAY AND NIGHT,"Little boy!_"" and makes me cry,"
210,DAY AND NIGHT,By my mother I am led
211,DAY AND NIGHT,Home again and put to bed.
212,DAY AND NIGHT,
213,DAY AND NIGHT,
214,DAY AND NIGHT,

216,THE DEVIL'S BAG,THE DEVIL'S BAG
217,THE DEVIL'S BAG,
218,THE DEVIL'S BAG,I saw the Devil walking down the lane
219,THE DEVIL'S BAG,Behind our house.--There was a heavy bag
220,THE DEVIL'S BAG,"Strapped tightly on his shoulders, and the rain"
221,THE DEVIL'S BAG,Sizzled when it hit him.  He picked a rag
222,THE DEVIL'S BAG,"Up from the ground and put it in his sack,"
223,THE DEVIL'S BAG,And grinned and rubbed his hands.
224,THE DEVIL'S BAG,There was a thing
225,THE DEVIL'S BAG,Moving inside the bag upon his back--
226,THE DEVIL'S BAG,It must have been a soul!  I saw it fling
227,THE DEVIL'S BAG,"And twist about inside, and not a hole"
228,THE DEVIL'S BAG,"Or cranny for escape!  Oh, it was sad!"
229,THE DEVIL'S BAG,"I cried, and shouted out, ""_Let out that soul!_"""
230,THE DEVIL'S BAG,"But he turned round, and, sure, his face went mad,"
231,THE DEVIL'S BAG,"And twisted up and down, and he said ""_Hell!_"""
232,THE DEVIL'S BAG,"And ran away....  Oh, mammy! I'm not well."

237,A VISIT FROM ABROAD,A VISIT FROM ABROAD
238,A VISIT FROM ABROAD,
239,A VISIT FROM ABROAD,A speck went blowing up against the sky
240,A VISIT FROM ABROAD,As little as a leaf: then it drew near
241,A VISIT FROM ABROAD,"And broadened.--""It's a bird,"" said I,"
242,A VISIT FROM ABROAD,And fetched my bow and arrows.  It was queer!
243,A VISIT FROM ABROAD,"It grew up from a speck into a blot,"
244,A VISIT FROM ABROAD,And squattered past a cloud; then it flew down
245,A VISIT FROM ABROAD,"All crumply, and waggled such a lot"
246,A VISIT FROM ABROAD,I thought the thing would fall.--It was a brown
247,A VISIT FROM ABROAD,Old carpet where a man was sitting snug
248,A VISIT FROM ABROAD,"Who, when he reached the ground, began to sew"
249,A VISIT FROM ABROAD,"A big hole in the middle of the rug,"
250,A VISIT FROM ABROAD,And kept on peeping everywhere to know
251,A VISIT FROM ABROAD,Who might be coming--then he gave a twist
252,A VISIT FROM ABROAD,And flew away....  I fired at him but missed.

257,THE WOOD OF FLOWERS,THE WOOD OF FLOWERS
258,THE WOOD OF FLOWERS,
259,THE WOOD OF FLOWERS,I went to the Wood of Flowers
260,THE WOOD OF FLOWERS,(No one was with me);
261,THE WOOD OF FLOWERS,I was there alone for hours.
262,THE WOOD OF FLOWERS,I was happy as could be
263,THE WOOD OF FLOWERS,In the Wood of Flowers.
264,THE WOOD OF FLOWERS,
265,THE WOOD OF FLOWERS,"There was grass on the ground,"
266,THE WOOD OF FLOWERS,"There were buds on the tree,"
267,THE WOOD OF FLOWERS,And the wind had a sound
268,THE WOOD OF FLOWERS,"Of such gaiety,"
269,THE WOOD OF FLOWERS,That I was as happy
270,THE WOOD OF FLOWERS,"As happy could be,"
271,THE WOOD OF FLOWERS,In the Wood of Flowers.
272,THE WOOD OF FLOWERS,

276,THE WHITE WINDOW,THE WHITE WINDOW
277,THE WHITE WINDOW,
278,THE WHITE WINDOW,The moon comes every night to peep
279,THE WHITE WINDOW,"Through the window where I lie,"
280,THE WHITE WINDOW,And I pretend to be asleep;
281,THE WHITE WINDOW,"But I watch the moon as it goes by,"
282,THE WHITE WINDOW,And it never makes a sound.
283,THE WHITE WINDOW,
284,THE WHITE WINDOW,"It stands and stares, and then it goes"
285,THE WHITE WINDOW,"To the house that's next to me,"
286,THE WHITE WINDOW,"Stealing on its tippy-toes,"
287,THE WHITE WINDOW,To peep at folk asleep maybe;
288,THE WHITE WINDOW,And it never makes a sound.
289,THE WHITE WINDOW,
290,THE WHITE WINDOW,
291,THE WHITE WINDOW,
292,THE WHITE WINDOW,
293,MIDNIGHT,MIDNIGHT
294,MIDNIGHT,
295,MIDNIGHT,And then I wakened up in such a fright;
296,MIDNIGHT,I thought I heard a movement in the room
297,MIDNIGHT,But did not dare to look; I snuggled right
298,MIDNIGHT,Down underneath the bedclothes--then the boom
299,MIDNIGHT,"Of a tremendous voice said, ""_Sit up, lad,"
300,MIDNIGHT,"And let me see your face._""  So up I sat,"
301,MIDNIGHT,Although I didn't want to.  I was glad
302,MIDNIGHT,"I did though, for it was an angel that"
303,MIDNIGHT,"Had called me, and he said, he'd come to know"
304,MIDNIGHT,Was I the boy who wouldn't say his prayers
305,MIDNIGHT,"Nor do his sums, and that I'd have to go"
306,MIDNIGHT,Straight down to hell because of such affairs.
307,MIDNIGHT,... I said I'd be converted and do good
308,MIDNIGHT,If he would let me off--he said he would.

314,BEHIND THE HILL,
315,BEHIND THE HILL,Behind the hill I met a man in green
316,BEHIND THE HILL,Who asked me if my mother had gone out?
317,BEHIND THE HILL,I said she had.  He asked me had I seen
318,BEHIND THE HILL,His castle where the people sing and shout
319,BEHIND THE HILL,"From dawn to dark, and told me that he had"
320,BEHIND THE HILL,"A crock of gold inside a hollow tree,"
321,BEHIND THE HILL,And I could have it.--I wanted money bad
322,BEHIND THE HILL,"To buy a sword with, and I thought that he"
323,BEHIND THE HILL,"Would keep his solemn word; so, off we went."
324,BEHIND THE HILL,"He said he had a pound hid in the crock,"
325,BEHIND THE HILL,"And owned the castle too, and paid no rent"
326,BEHIND THE HILL,"To any one, and that you had to knock"
327,BEHIND THE HILL,"Five hundred times.  I asked, ""_Who reckoned up?_"""
328,BEHIND THE HILL,"And he said, ""_You insulting little pup!_"""

333,THE SECRET,THE SECRET
334,THE SECRET,
335,THE SECRET,"I was frightened, for a wind"
336,THE SECRET,Crept along the grass to say
337,THE SECRET,Something that was in my mind
338,THE SECRET,Yesterday--
339,THE SECRET,
340,THE SECRET,Something that I did not know
341,THE SECRET,"Could be found out by the wind,"
342,THE SECRET,I had buried it so low
343,THE SECRET,In my mind.

349,APRIL SHOWERS,
350,APRIL SHOWERS,"The leaves are fresh after the rain,"
351,APRIL SHOWERS,"The air is cool and clear,"
352,APRIL SHOWERS,"The sun is shining warm again,"
353,APRIL SHOWERS,The sparrows hopping in the lane
354,APRIL SHOWERS,Are brisk and full of cheer.
355,APRIL SHOWERS,
356,APRIL SHOWERS,"And that is why we dance and play,"
357,APRIL SHOWERS,"And that is why we sing,"
358,APRIL SHOWERS,"Calling out in voices gay,"
359,APRIL SHOWERS,We will not go to school to-day
360,APRIL SHOWERS,Or learn anything:
361,APRIL SHOWERS,
362,APRIL SHOWERS,"It is a happy thing, I say,"
363,APRIL SHOWERS,To be alive on such a day.

368,THE TURN OF THE ROAD,THE TURN OF THE ROAD
369,THE TURN OF THE ROAD,
370,THE TURN OF THE ROAD,I was playing with my hoop along the road
371,THE TURN OF THE ROAD,"Just where the bushes are, when, suddenly,"
372,THE TURN OF THE ROAD,There came a shout.--I ran away and stowed
373,THE TURN OF THE ROAD,"Myself beneath a bush, and watched to see"
374,THE TURN OF THE ROAD,"What made the noise, and then, around the bend,"
375,THE TURN OF THE ROAD,I saw a woman running.  She was old
376,THE TURN OF THE ROAD,"And wrinkle-faced, and had big teeth.--The end"
377,THE TURN OF THE ROAD,Of her red shawl caught on a bush and rolled
378,THE TURN OF THE ROAD,"Right off her, and her hair fell down.--Her face"
379,THE TURN OF THE ROAD,"Was awful white, and both her eyes looked sick,"
380,THE TURN OF THE ROAD,"And she was talking queer.  ""_O God of Grace!_"""
381,THE TURN OF THE ROAD,"Said she, ""_where is the child?_"" and flew back quick"
382,THE TURN OF THE ROAD,"The way she came, and screamed, and shook her hands;"
383,THE TURN OF THE ROAD,... Maybe she was a witch from foreign lands.

388,THE CORAL ISLAND,THE CORAL ISLAND
389,THE CORAL ISLAND,
390,THE CORAL ISLAND,"His arms were round a chest of oaken wood,"
391,THE CORAL ISLAND,"It was clamped with brass and iron studs, and seemed"
392,THE CORAL ISLAND,An awful weight.  After a while he stood
393,THE CORAL ISLAND,And I stole near to him.--His white eyes gleamed
394,THE CORAL ISLAND,As he peeped secretly about; he laid
395,THE CORAL ISLAND,"The oaken chest upon the ground, then drew"
396,THE CORAL ISLAND,"A great knife from his belt, and stuck the blade"
397,THE CORAL ISLAND,Into the ground and dug.  The clay soon flew
398,THE CORAL ISLAND,"In all directions underneath a tree,"
399,THE CORAL ISLAND,And when the hole was deep he put the box
400,THE CORAL ISLAND,"Down there, and threw the clay back cunningly,"
401,THE CORAL ISLAND,Stamping the ground quite flat; then like a fox
402,THE CORAL ISLAND,He crept among the trees....  I went next day
403,THE CORAL ISLAND,"To dig the treasure up, but I lost my way."

409,THE COW,
410,THE COW,"Cow, Cow!"
411,THE COW,I and thou
412,THE COW,Are looking at each other's eyes
413,THE COW,You are lying on the grass
414,THE COW,"Eating every time I pass,"
415,THE COW,And you do not seem to be
416,THE COW,Ever in perplexity:
417,THE COW,"You are good I'm sure, and not"
418,THE COW,Fit for nothing but the pot:
419,THE COW,"For your bearing is so kind,"
420,THE COW,And your quietness so wise:
421,THE COW,"Cow, Cow!"
422,THE COW,I and thou
423,THE COW,Are looking at each other's eyes.

429,THE OLD MAN,
430,THE OLD MAN,An old man sat beneath a tree
431,THE OLD MAN,Alone;
432,THE OLD MAN,So still was he
433,THE OLD MAN,"That, if he had been carved in stone,"
434,THE OLD MAN,He could not be
435,THE OLD MAN,More quiet or more cold:
436,THE OLD MAN,He was an ancient man
437,THE OLD MAN,More than
438,THE OLD MAN,A thousand ages old.

443,WHAT THE SNAKE SAW,WHAT THE SNAKE SAW
444,WHAT THE SNAKE SAW,
445,WHAT THE SNAKE SAW,A little girl and a big ugly man
446,WHAT THE SNAKE SAW,Went down the road.  The girl was crying
447,WHAT THE SNAKE SAW,"And asking to go home, but when she ran"
448,WHAT THE SNAKE SAW,"He hit her on the head and sent her flying,"
449,WHAT THE SNAKE SAW,"And called her a young imp, and said he'd break"
450,WHAT THE SNAKE SAW,"Her neck unless she went with him, and then"
451,WHAT THE SNAKE SAW,He smacked her on the cheek.--I was a snake
452,WHAT THE SNAKE SAW,"At that time crawling through a robber's den,"
453,WHAT THE SNAKE SAW,And diamonds were sticking to my tongue--
454,WHAT THE SNAKE SAW,"(That's the best dodge), but when I saw the way"
455,WHAT THE SNAKE SAW,He beat the little girl I up and flung
456,WHAT THE SNAKE SAW,A stone at him.  My aim was bad that day
457,WHAT THE SNAKE SAW,Because I hit the girl ... and she did sing!
458,WHAT THE SNAKE SAW,But he jumped round and cursed like anything.

465,THE HORSE,"A sparrow hopped about the street,"
466,THE HORSE,And he was not a bit afraid;
