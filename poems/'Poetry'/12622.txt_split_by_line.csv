56,PREFACE.,
57,PREFACE.,"This volume contains, besides the poems published in 1850 and 1857,[1]"
58,PREFACE.,the odes written for the centenary celebrations in honour of O'Connell
59,PREFACE.,"in 1875, and of Moore in 1879.  To these are added several sonnets and"
60,PREFACE.,"miscellaneous poems now first collected, and the episode of ""Ferdiah"""
61,PREFACE.,translated from the 'Tain Bo Chuailgne.'
62,PREFACE.,
63,PREFACE.,"Born in Dublin,[2] May 26th, 1817, my father, while still very young,"
64,PREFACE.,showed a decided taste for literature.  The course of his boyish reading
65,PREFACE.,"is indicated in his ""Lament.""  Some verses from his pen, headed ""My"
66,PREFACE.,"Wishes,"" appeared in the ""Dublin Satirist,"" April 12th, 1834.  This was,"
67,PREFACE.,"as far as I can discover, the earliest of his writings published.  To"
68,PREFACE.,"the journal just mentioned he frequently contributed, both in prose and"
69,PREFACE.,"verse, during the next two years.  The following are some of the"
70,PREFACE.,"titles:--""The Greenwood Hill;"" ""Songs of other Days"" (Belshazzar's"
71,PREFACE.,"Feast--Thoughts in the Holy Land--Thoughts of the Past); ""Life,"""
72,PREFACE.,"""Death,"" ""Fables"" (The Zephyr and the Sensitive Plant--The"
73,PREFACE.,"Tulip and the Rose--The Bee and the Rose); ""Songs of Birds"""
74,PREFACE.,"(Nightingale--Eagle--Phoenix--Fire-fly); ""Songs of the Winds,"" &c."
75,PREFACE.,
76,PREFACE.,"On October 14th, 1843, his first contribution (""Proclamation Songs,"" No."
77,PREFACE.,"1) appeared in the Dublin ""Nation.""  ""Here is a song by a new recruit,"""
78,PREFACE.,"wrote Mr., now Sir, Charles Gavan Duffy, ""which we should give in our"
79,PREFACE.,"leading columns if they were not preoccupied.""  In the next number I"
80,PREFACE.,"find ""The Battle of Clontarf,"" with this editorial note: ""'Desmond' is"
81,PREFACE.,"entitled to be enrolled in our national brigade.""  ""A Dream"" soon"
82,PREFACE.,"follows; and at intervals, between this date and 1849--besides many"
83,PREFACE.,other poems--all the National songs and most of the Ballads included in
84,PREFACE.,"this volume.  In April, 1847, ""The Bell-Founder"" and ""The Foray of Con"
85,PREFACE.,"O'Donnell"" appeared in the ""University Magazine,"" in which ""Waiting for"
86,PREFACE.,"the May,"" ""The Bridal of the Year,"" and ""The Voyage of Saint Brendan,"""
87,PREFACE.,"were subsequently published (in January and May, 1848).  Meanwhile, in"
88,PREFACE.,"1846, the year in which he was called to the bar, he edited the ""Poets"
89,PREFACE.,"and Dramatists of Ireland,"" with an introduction, which evinced"
90,PREFACE.,"considerable reading, on the early religion and literature of the Irish"
91,PREFACE.,"people.  In the same year he also edited the ""Book of Irish Ballads,"" to"
92,PREFACE.,which he prefixed an introduction on ballad poetry.  This volume was
93,PREFACE.,"republished with additions and a preface in 1869.  In 1853, the poems"
94,PREFACE.,"afterwards published under the title of ""Underglimpses"" were chiefly"
95,PREFACE.,written.[3]
96,PREFACE.,
97,PREFACE.,The plays of Calderon--thoroughly national in form and matter--have met
98,PREFACE.,with but scant appreciation from foreigners.  Yet we find his genius
99,PREFACE.,"recognized in unexpected quarters, Goethe and Shelley uniting with"
100,PREFACE.,Augustus Schlegel and Archbishop Trench to pay him homage.  My father
101,PREFACE.,"was, I think, first led to the study of Calderon by Shelley's glowing"
102,PREFACE.,"eulogy of the poet (""Essays,"" vol. ii., p. 274, and elsewhere).  The"
103,PREFACE.,"first of his translations was published in 1853, the last twenty years"
104,PREFACE.,"later.  They consist[4] of fifteen complete plays, which I believe to be"
105,PREFACE.,"the largest amount of translated verse by any one author, that has ever"
106,PREFACE.,appeared in English.  Most of it is in the difficult assonant or vowel
107,PREFACE.,"rhyme, hardly ever previously attempted in our language.  This may be a"
108,PREFACE.,fitting place to cite a few testimonies as to the execution of the work.
109,PREFACE.,"Longfellow, whom I have myself heard speak of the ""Autos"" in a way that"
110,PREFACE.,"showed how deeply he had studied them in the original, wrote, in 1857:"
111,PREFACE.,"""You are doing this work admirably, and seem to gain new strength and"
112,PREFACE.,sweetness as you go on.  It seems as if Calderon himself were behind you
113,PREFACE.,whispering and suggesting.  And what better work could you do in your
114,PREFACE.,"bright hours or in your dark hours that just this, which seems to have"
115,PREFACE.,"been put providentially into your hands.""  Again, in 1862: ""Your new"
116,PREFACE.,"work in the vast and flowery fields of Calderon is, I think, admirable,"
117,PREFACE.,and presents the old Spanish dramatist before the English reader in a
118,PREFACE.,very attractive light.  Particularly in the most poetical passages you
119,PREFACE.,"are excellent; as, for instance, in the fine description of the"
120,PREFACE.,gerfalcon and the heron in 'El Mayor Encanto.'  I hope you mean to add
121,PREFACE.,"more and more, so as to make the translation as nearly complete as a"
122,PREFACE.,single life will permit.  It seems rather appalling to undertake the
123,PREFACE.,"whole of so voluminous a writer; nevertheless, I hope you will do it."
124,PREFACE.,"Having proved that you can, perhaps you ought to do it.  This may be"
125,PREFACE.,"your appointed work.  It is a noble one.""[5]  Ticknor (""History of"
126,PREFACE.,"Spanish Literature,"" new edition, vol. iii. p. 461) writes thus:"
127,PREFACE.,"""Calderon is a poet who, whenever he is translated, should have his very"
128,PREFACE.,"excesses and extravagances, both in thought and manner, fully"
129,PREFACE.,"reproduced, in order to give a faithful idea of what is grandest and"
130,PREFACE.,"most distinctive in his genius.  Mr. MacCarthy has done this, I"
131,PREFACE.,"conceive, to a degree which I had previously supposed impossible."
132,PREFACE.,"Nothing, I think, in the English language will give us so true an"
133,PREFACE.,impression of what is most characteristic of the Spanish drama; perhaps
134,PREFACE.,"I ought to say, of what is most characteristic of Spanish poetry"
135,PREFACE.,"generally."""
136,PREFACE.,
137,PREFACE.,"Another eminent Hispaniologist (Mr. C. F. Bradford, of Boston) has"
138,PREFACE.,spoken of the work in similar terms.  His labours did not pass without
139,PREFACE.,recognition from the great dramatist's countrymen.  He was elected a
140,PREFACE.,"member of the Real Academia some years ago, and in 1881 this learned"
141,PREFACE.,body presented him with the medal struck in commemoration of Calderon's
142,PREFACE.,"bicentenary, ""in token of their gratitude and their appreciation of his"
143,PREFACE.,"translations of the great poet's works."""
144,PREFACE.,
145,PREFACE.,"In 1855, at the request of the Marchioness of Donegal, my father wrote"
146,PREFACE.,"the ode which was recited at the inauguration of the statue of her son,"
147,PREFACE.,"the Earl of Belfast.  About the same time, his Lectures on Poetry were"
148,PREFACE.,delivered at the Catholic University at the desire of Cardinal Newman.
149,PREFACE.,"The Lectures on the Poets of Spain, and on the Dramatists of the"
150,PREFACE.,"Sixteenth Century, were delivered a few years later.  In 1862 he"
151,PREFACE.,"published a curious bibliographical treatise on the ""Memoires of the"
152,PREFACE.,"Marquis de Villars.""  In 1864 the ill-health of some of his family his"
153,PREFACE.,leaving his home near Killiney Hill[6] to reside on the Continent.  In
154,PREFACE.,"1872, ""Shelley's Early Life"" was published in London, where he had"
155,PREFACE.,"settled, attracted by the facilities for research which its great"
156,PREFACE.,libraries offered.  This biography gives an amusing account of the young
157,PREFACE.,"poet's visit to Dublin in 1812, and some new details of his adventures"
158,PREFACE.,and writings at this period.  My father's admiration for Shelley was of
159,PREFACE.,long standing.  At the age of seventeen he wrote some lines to the
160,PREFACE.,"poet's memory, which appeared in the ""Dublin Satirist"" already"
161,PREFACE.,"mentioned, and an elaborate review of his poetry in an early number of"
162,PREFACE.,the Nation.  I have before alluded to Shelley's influence in directing
163,PREFACE.,his attention to Calderon.  The centenary odes in honour of O'Connell
164,PREFACE.,"and Moore were written, in 1875 and 1879, at the request of the"
165,PREFACE.,committees which had charge of these celebrations.  He returned to
166,PREFACE.,"Ireland a few months before his death, which took place at Blackrock,"
167,PREFACE.,"near Dublin, on April 7th,[7] in the present year.  His nature was most"
168,PREFACE.,"sensitive, but though it was his lot to suffer many sorrows, I never"
169,PREFACE.,heard a complaint or and unkind word from his lips.
170,PREFACE.,
171,PREFACE.,From what has been said it will be evident that this volume contains
172,PREFACE.,"only a part of his poetical works, it having been found impossible to"
173,PREFACE.,"include the humorous pieces, parodies, and epigrams, without some"
174,PREFACE.,acquaintance with which an imperfect idea would be formed of his genius.
175,PREFACE.,The same may be said of his numerous translations from various languages
176,PREFACE.,"(exclusive of Calderon's plays).  Of those published in 1850, ""The"
177,PREFACE.,"Romance of Maleca,"" ""Saint George's Knight,"" ""The Christmas of the"
178,PREFACE.,"Foreign Child,"" and others have been frequently reprinted.  He has since"
179,PREFACE.,"rendered from the Spanish poems by Juan de Pedraza, Antonio de Trueba,"
180,PREFACE.,"Garcilaso de la Vega, Gongora and ""Fernan Caballero,"" whom he visited"
181,PREFACE.,"when in Spain shortly before her death, and whose prose story, ""The Two"
182,PREFACE.,"Muleteers,"" he has also translated.  To these must be added, besides"
183,PREFACE.,"several shorter ballads from Duran's Romancero General, ""The Poem of the"
184,PREFACE.,"Cid,"" ""The Romance of Gayferos,"" and ""The Infanta of France.""  The last"
185,PREFACE.,"is a metrical tale of the fourteenth or fifteenth century, presenting"
186,PREFACE.,"analogies with the ""Thousand and One Nights,"" and probably drawn from an"
187,PREFACE.,"Oriental source.  His translations from the Latin, chiefly of mediaeval"
188,PREFACE.,"hymns, are also numerous."
189,PREFACE.,
190,PREFACE.,"In inserting the poem of ""Ferdiah"" I was influenced by its subject as"
191,PREFACE.,well as by the wish of friends.  A few extracts appeared in a magazine
192,PREFACE.,"several years ago, and it was afterwards completed without any view to"
193,PREFACE.,publication.  It follows the present Irish text[8] as closely as the
194,PREFACE.,laws of metre will allow.  Since these pages were in the printer's hands
195,PREFACE.,Mr. Aubrey de Vere has given to the world his treatment of the same
196,PREFACE.,"theme,[9] adorning as usual all that he touches.  As he well says: ""It"
197,PREFACE.,is not in the form of translation that an ancient Irish tale of any
198,PREFACE.,considerable length admits of being rendered in poetry.  What is needed
199,PREFACE.,is to select from the original such portions as are at once the most
200,PREFACE.,"essential to the story, and the most characteristic, reproducing them in"
201,PREFACE.,"a condensed form, and taking care that the necessary additions bring out"
202,PREFACE.,"the idea, and contain nothing that is not in the spirit of the"
203,PREFACE.,"original.""  (Preface, p. vii.)  The ""Tale of Troy Divine"" owes its form,"
204,PREFACE.,"and we may never know how much of its tenderness and grace, to its"
205,PREFACE.,"Alexandrian editor.  However, the present version may, from its very"
206,PREFACE.,"literalness, have and interest for some readers."
207,PREFACE.,
208,PREFACE.,Many of the earlier poems here collected have been admirably rendered
209,PREFACE.,into French by the late M. Ernest de Chatelain.[10]  The Moore Centenary
210,PREFACE.,"Ode has been translated into Latin by the Rev. M. J. Blacker, M. A."
211,PREFACE.,
212,PREFACE.,"My thanks are due to the Rev. Matthew Russell, S. J., for his kind"
213,PREFACE.,"assistance in preparing this book for the press, and to the Publishers"
214,PREFACE.,for the accuracy and speed with which it has been produced.
215,PREFACE.,
216,PREFACE.,I cannot let pass this opportunity of expressing my gratitude for the
217,PREFACE.,self-sacrificing labours of the committee formed at the suggestion of
218,PREFACE.,"Mr. William Lane Joynt, D. L., to honour my father's memory, and for the"
219,PREFACE.,generous response his friends have made to their appeal.[11]

237,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"censured as remote from human interest.  Yet a critic of deep insight,"
238,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"George Gilfillan, declares his special admiration for ""the joyous,"
239,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"sunny, lark-like carols on May, almost worthy of Shelley, and such"
240,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"delicate, tender, Moore-like 'trifles' (shall I call them?) as 'All"
241,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"Fool's Day.'  The whole"" he adds, ""is full of a beautiful poetic spirit,"
242,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"and rich resources both of fancy and language.""  I may be permitted to"
243,JOHN MAC CARTHY,transcribe here an extract from some unpublished comments by Sir William
244,JOHN MAC CARTHY,Rowan Hamilton on another poem of the same class.  His remarks are
245,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"interesting in themselves, as coming from one illustrious as a man of"
246,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"science, and, at the same time, a true poet--a combination which may"
247,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"hereafter become more frequent, since already in the vast regions of"
248,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"space and time brought within human ken, imagination strives hard to"
249,JOHN MAC CARTHY,keep pace with established fact.  In a manuscript volume now in the
250,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"Library of Trinity College, Dublin, he writes, under date, May, 1848:--"
251,JOHN MAC CARTHY,
252,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"""The University Magazine for the present month contains a poem which"
253,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"delights one, entitled 'The Bridal of the Year.'  It is signed 'D. F. M."
254,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"C.,' as is also a shorter, but almost a sweeter piece immediately"
255,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"following it, and headed, 'Summer Longings.'"""
256,JOHN MAC CARTHY,
257,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"Sir William goes through the whole poem, copying and criticising every"
258,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"stanza, and concludes as follows:--"
259,JOHN MAC CARTHY,
260,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"""After a very pretty ninth stanza respecting the 'fairy"
261,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"phantoms' in the poet's 'glorious visions seen,' which the"
262,JOHN MAC CARTHY,author conceives to 'follow the poet's steps beneath the
263,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"morning's beam,' he burst into rapture at the approach of the"
264,JOHN MAC CARTHY,Bride herself--
265,JOHN MAC CARTHY,
266,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"""'Bright as are the planets seven--"
267,JOHN MAC CARTHY,with her glances
268,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"She advances,"
269,JOHN MAC CARTHY,For her azure eyes are Heaven!
270,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"And her robes are sunbeams woven,"
271,JOHN MAC CARTHY,And her beauteous bridesmaids are
272,JOHN MAC CARTHY,Hopes and wishes--
273,JOHN MAC CARTHY,Dreams delicious--
274,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"Joys from some serener star,"
275,JOHN MAC CARTHY,And Heavenly-hued Illusions gleaming from afar!'
276,JOHN MAC CARTHY,
277,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"""Her eyes 'are' heaven, her robes 'are' sunbeams, and with these"
278,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"physical aspects of the May, how well does the author of this ode (for"
279,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"such, surely, we may term the poem, so rich in lyrical enthusiasm and"
280,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"varied melody) conceive the combination as bridesmaids, as companions to"
281,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"the bride; of those mental feelings, those new buddings of hope in the"
282,JOHN MAC CARTHY,heart which the season is fitted to awaken.  The azure eyes glitter back
283,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"to ours, for the planets shine upon us from the lovely summer night; but"
284,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"lovelier still are those 'dreams delicious, joys from some serener"
285,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"star,' which at the same sweet season float down invisibly, and win"
286,JOHN MAC CARTHY,their entrance to our souls.  The image of a bridal is happily and
287,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"naturally kept before us in the remaining stanzas of this poem, which"
288,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"well deserve to be copied here, in continuation of these notes--the"
289,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"former for its cheerfulness, the latter for its sweetness.  I wish that"
290,JOHN MAC CARTHY,"I knew the author, or even that I were acquainted with his name.--Since"

2264,FERGUS.,"Certain were they it would their own lord be,"
2265,FERGUS.,"Since on the Tain Bo Cuailgne, it was plain"
2266,FERGUS.,That no one with Cuchullin could contend.
2267,FERGUS.,
2268,FERGUS.,Nor was their chief less troubled; but at first
2269,FERGUS.,The fumes of the late revel overpowered
2270,FERGUS.,"His senses, and he slept a heavy sleep."
2271,FERGUS.,"Later he woke, the intoxicating steam"
2272,FERGUS.,"Had left his brain, and now in sober calm"
2273,FERGUS.,All the anxieties of the impending fight
2274,FERGUS.,Pressed on his soul and made him grave.[47]  He rose
2275,FERGUS.,"From off his couch, and bade his charioteer"
2276,FERGUS.,Harness his pawing horses to the car.
2277,FERGUS.,"The boy would fain persuade his lord to stay,"
2278,FERGUS.,"Because he loved his master, and he felt"
2279,FERGUS.,He went but to his death; but he repelled
2280,FERGUS.,"The youth's advice, and spoke to him these words--"
2281,FERGUS.,"""Oh! cease, my servant.  I will not be turned"
2282,FERGUS.,"By any youth from what I have resolved."""
2283,FERGUS.,And thus in speech and answer spoke the two--
2284,FERGUS.,
2285,FERDIAH.,FERDIAH.
2286,FERDIAH.,
2287,FERDIAH.,"Let us go to this challenge,"
2288,FERDIAH.,"Let us fly to the Ford,"
2289,FERDIAH.,When the raven shall croak
2290,FERDIAH.,O'er my blood-dripping sword.
2291,FERDIAH.,"Oh, woe for Cuchullin!"
2292,FERDIAH.,That sword will be red;
2293,FERDIAH.,"Oh, woe! for to-morrow"
2294,FERDIAH.,The hero lies dead.
2295,FERDIAH.,
2296,CHARIOTEER.,CHARIOTEER.
2297,CHARIOTEER.,
2298,CHARIOTEER.,"Thy words are not gentle,"
2299,CHARIOTEER.,"Yet rest where thou art,"
2300,CHARIOTEER.,"'Twill be dreadful to meet,"
2301,CHARIOTEER.,And distressful to part.
2302,CHARIOTEER.,The champion of Ulster!
2303,CHARIOTEER.,Oh! think what a foe!
2304,CHARIOTEER.,"In that meeting there's grief,"
2305,CHARIOTEER.,In that journey there's woe!
2306,CHARIOTEER.,
2307,FERDIAH.,FERDIAH.
2308,FERDIAH.,
2309,FERDIAH.,"Thy counsel is craven,"
2310,FERDIAH.,"Thy caution I slight,"
2311,FERDIAH.,No brave-hearted champion
2312,FERDIAH.,Should shrink from the fight.
2313,FERDIAH.,The blood I inherit
2314,FERDIAH.,Doth prompt me to do--
2315,FERDIAH.,"Let us go to the challenge,"
2316,FERDIAH.,To the Ford let us go!
2317,FERDIAH.,
2318,FERDIAH.,Then were the horses of Ferdiah yoked
2319,FERDIAH.,"Unto the chariot, and he rode full speed"
2320,FERDIAH.,"Unto the Ford of battle, and the day"
2321,FERDIAH.,"Began to break, and all the east grew red."
2322,FERDIAH.,
2323,FERDIAH.,"Beside the Ford he halted.  ""Good, my friend,"""
2324,FERDIAH.,"He said unto his servant, ""Spread for me"
2325,FERDIAH.,The skins and cushions of my chariot here
2326,FERDIAH.,"Beneath me, that I may a full deep sleep"
2327,FERDIAH.,Enjoy before the hour of fight arrives;
2328,FERDIAH.,For in the latter portion of the night
2329,FERDIAH.,"I slept not, thinking of the fight to come."""
2330,FERDIAH.,"Unharnessed were the horses, and the boy"
2331,FERDIAH.,"Spread out the cushions and the chariot's skins,"
2332,FERDIAH.,And heavy sleep fell on Ferdiah's lids.
2333,FERDIAH.,
2334,FERDIAH.,Now of Cuchullin will I speak.  He rose
2335,FERDIAH.,"Not until day with all its light had come,"
2336,FERDIAH.,In order that the men of Erin ne'er
2337,FERDIAH.,Should say of him that it was fear or dread
2338,FERDIAH.,That made him from a restless couch arise.
2339,FERDIAH.,When in the fulness of its light at length
2340,FERDIAH.,"Shone forth the day, he bade his charioteer"
2341,FERDIAH.,Harness his horses and his chariot yoke.
2342,FERDIAH.,"""Harness my horses, good, my servant,"" said"
2343,FERDIAH.,"Cuchullin, ""and my chariot yoke for me,"
2344,FERDIAH.,For lo! an early-rising champion comes
2345,FERDIAH.,To meet us here beside the Ford to-day--
2346,FERDIAH.,"Ferdiah, son of Daman, Dare's son."""
2347,FERDIAH.,"""My lord, the steeds are ready to thy hand;"
2348,FERDIAH.,"Thy chariot stands here yoked, do thou step in;"
2349,FERDIAH.,"The noble car will not disgrace its lord."""
2350,FERDIAH.,
2351,FERDIAH.,"Into the chariot, then, the dextrous, bold,"
2352,FERDIAH.,"Red-sworded, battle-winning hero sprang"
2353,FERDIAH.,"Cuchullin, son of Sualtam, at a bound."
2354,FERDIAH.,"Invisible Bocanachs and Bananachs,"
2355,FERDIAH.,"And Geniti Glindi[48] shouted round the car,"
2356,FERDIAH.,And demons of the earth and of the air.
2357,FERDIAH.,For thus the Tuatha de Danaans used
2358,FERDIAH.,By sorceries to raise those fearful cries
2359,FERDIAH.,"Around him, that the terror and the fear"
2360,FERDIAH.,"Of him should be the greater, as he swept"
2361,FERDIAH.,On with his staff of spirits to the war.
2362,FERDIAH.,
2363,FERDIAH.,Soon was it when Ferdiah's charioteer
2364,FERDIAH.,"Heard the approaching clamour and the shout,"
2365,FERDIAH.,"The rattle and the clatter, and the roar,"
2366,FERDIAH.,"The whistle, and the thunder, and the tramp,"
2367,FERDIAH.,"The clanking discord of the missive shields,"
2368,FERDIAH.,"The clang of swords, the hissing sound of spears,"
2369,FERDIAH.,"The tinkling of the helmet, the sharp crash"
2370,FERDIAH.,"Of armour and of arms, the straining ropes,"
2371,FERDIAH.,"The dangling bucklers, the resounding wheels,"
2372,FERDIAH.,"The creaking chariot, and the proud approach"
2373,FERDIAH.,Of the triumphant champion of the Ford.
2374,FERDIAH.,"Clutching his master's robe, the charioteer"
2375,FERDIAH.,"Cried out, ""Ferdiah, rise! for lo, thy foes"
2376,FERDIAH.,"Are on thee!""  Then the Spirit of Insight fell"
2377,FERDIAH.,"Prophetic on the youth, and thus he sang."
2378,FERDIAH.,
2379,CHARIOTEER.,CHARIOTEER.
2380,CHARIOTEER.,
2381,CHARIOTEER.,"I hear the rushing of a car,"
2382,CHARIOTEER.,Near and more near its proud wheels run
2383,CHARIOTEER.,A chariot for the God of War
2384,CHARIOTEER.,Bursts--as from clouds the sun!
2385,CHARIOTEER.,"Over Bregg-Ross it speeds along,"
2386,CHARIOTEER.,Hark! its thunders peal afar!
2387,CHARIOTEER.,"Oh! its steeds are swift and strong,"
2388,CHARIOTEER.,And the Victories guide that car.
2389,CHARIOTEER.,
2390,CHARIOTEER.,"The Hound of Ulster shaketh the reins,"
2391,CHARIOTEER.,And white with foam is each courser's mouth;
2392,CHARIOTEER.,The Hawk of Ulster swoops o'er the plains
2393,CHARIOTEER.,To his quarry here in the south.
2394,CHARIOTEER.,"Like wintry storm that warrior's form,"
2395,CHARIOTEER.,Slaughter and Death beside him rush;
2396,CHARIOTEER.,"The groaning air is dark and warm,"
2397,CHARIOTEER.,And the low clouds bleed and blush.[49]
2398,CHARIOTEER.,
2399,CHARIOTEER.,"Oh, woe to him that is here on the hill,"
2400,CHARIOTEER.,Who is here on the hillock awaiting the Hound;
2401,CHARIOTEER.,Last year it was in a vision of ill
2402,CHARIOTEER.,I saw this sight and I heard this sound.
2403,CHARIOTEER.,"Methought Emania's Hound drew nigh,"
2404,CHARIOTEER.,"Methought the Hound of Battle drew near,"
2405,CHARIOTEER.,"I heard his steps and I saw his eye,"
2406,CHARIOTEER.,And again I see and I hear.
2407,CHARIOTEER.,
2408,CHARIOTEER.,Then answer made Ferdiah in this wise:
2409,CHARIOTEER.,"""Why dost thou chafe me, talking of this man?"
2410,CHARIOTEER.,For thou hast never ceased to sing his praise
2411,CHARIOTEER.,Since from his home he came.  Thou surely art
2412,CHARIOTEER.,Not without wage for this: but nathless know
2413,CHARIOTEER.,Ailill and Mave have both foretold--by me
2414,CHARIOTEER.,"This man shall fall, shall fall for a reward"
2415,CHARIOTEER.,"Just as the deed:  This day he shall be slain,"
2416,CHARIOTEER.,For it is fated that I free the Ford.
2417,CHARIOTEER.,"'Tis time for the relief.""--And thus they spake:"
2418,CHARIOTEER.,
2419,FERDIAH.,FERDIAH.
2420,FERDIAH.,
2421,FERDIAH.,"Yes, it is time for the relief;"
2422,FERDIAH.,"Be silent then, nor speak his praise,"
2423,FERDIAH.,For prophecy forebodes this chief
2424,FERDIAH.,Shall pass not the predestined days;
2425,FERDIAH.,"Does fate for this forego its claim,"
2426,FERDIAH.,That Cuailgne's champion here should come
2427,FERDIAH.,In all his pride and pomp of fame?--
2428,FERDIAH.,Be sure he comes but to his doom.
2429,FERDIAH.,
2430,CHARIOTEER.,CHARIOTEER.
2431,CHARIOTEER.,
2432,CHARIOTEER.,If Cuailgne's champion here I see
2433,CHARIOTEER.,"In all his pride and pomp of fame,"
2434,CHARIOTEER.,"He little heeds the prophecy,"
2435,CHARIOTEER.,"So swift his course, so straight his aim."
2436,CHARIOTEER.,"Towards us he flies, as flies the gleam"
2437,CHARIOTEER.,"Of lightning, or as waters flow"
2438,CHARIOTEER.,From some high cliff o'er which the stream
2439,CHARIOTEER.,Drops in the foaming depths below.
2440,CHARIOTEER.,
2441,FERDIAH.,FERDIAH.
2442,FERDIAH.,
2443,FERDIAH.,"Highly rewarded thou must be,"
2444,FERDIAH.,"For much reward thou sure canst claim,"
2445,FERDIAH.,Else why with such persistency
2446,FERDIAH.,Thus sing his praises since he came?
2447,FERDIAH.,"And now that he approacheth nigh,"
2448,FERDIAH.,"And now that he doth draw more near,"
2449,FERDIAH.,It seems it is to glorify
2450,FERDIAH.,And not to attack him thou art here.
2451,FERDIAH.,
2452,FERDIAH.,Not long Ferdiah's charioteer had gazed
2453,FERDIAH.,"With wondering look on the majestic car,"
2454,FERDIAH.,"When, as with thunder-speed it wheeled more near,"
2455,FERDIAH.,He saw its whole construction and its plan:
2456,FERDIAH.,"A fair, flesh-seeking, four-peaked front it had,"
2457,FERDIAH.,And for its body a magnificent creit
2458,FERDIAH.,"Fashioned for war, in which the hero stood"
2459,FERDIAH.,"Full-armed and brandishing a mighty spear,"
2460,FERDIAH.,While o'er his head a green pavilion hung;
2461,FERDIAH.,"Beneath, two fleetly-bounding, large-eared, fierce,"
2462,FERDIAH.,"Whale-bellied, lively-hearted, high-flanked, proud,"
2463,FERDIAH.,"Slender-legged, wide-hoofed, broad-buttocked, prancing steeds,"
2464,FERDIAH.,Exulting leaped and bore the car along:
2465,FERDIAH.,"Under one yoke, the broad-backed steed was gray,"
2466,FERDIAH.,"Under the other, black the long-maned steed."
2467,FERDIAH.,
2468,FERDIAH.,"Like to a hawk swooping from off a cliff,"
2469,FERDIAH.,"Upon a day of harsh and biting wind,"
2470,FERDIAH.,Or like a spring gust on a wild March morn
2471,FERDIAH.,"Rushing resistless o'er a level plain,"
2472,FERDIAH.,Or like the fleetness of a stag when first
2473,FERDIAH.,'Tis started by the hounds in its first field--
2474,FERDIAH.,"So swept the horses of Cuchullin's car,"
2475,FERDIAH.,"Bounding as if o'er fiery flags they flew,"
2476,FERDIAH.,"Making the earth to shake beneath their tread,"
2477,FERDIAH.,And tremble 'neath the fleetness of their speed.
2478,FERDIAH.,
2479,FERDIAH.,"At length, upon the north side of the Ford,"
2480,FERDIAH.,Cuchullin stopped.  Upon the southern bank
2481,FERDIAH.,"Ferdiah stood, and thus addressed the chief:"
2482,FERDIAH.,"""Glad am I, O Cuchullin, thou hast come."""
2483,FERDIAH.,"""Up to this day,"" Cuchullin made reply,"
2484,FERDIAH.,"""Thy welcome would by me have been received"
2485,FERDIAH.,"As coming from a friend, but not to-day."
2486,FERDIAH.,"Besides, 'twere fitter that I welcomed thee,"
2487,FERDIAH.,Than that to me thou shouldst the welcome give;
2488,FERDIAH.,"'Tis I that should go forth to fight with thee,"
2489,FERDIAH.,"Not thou to me, because before thee are"
2490,FERDIAH.,"My women and my children, and my youths,"
2491,FERDIAH.,"My herds and flocks, my horses and my steeds."""
2492,FERDIAH.,"Ferdiah, half in scorn, spake then these words--"
2493,FERDIAH.,And then Cuchullin answered in his turn.
2494,FERDIAH.,"""Good, O Cuchullin, what untoward fate"
2495,FERDIAH.,Has brought thee here to measure swords with me?
2496,FERDIAH.,"For when we two with Scatha lived, in Skye,"
2497,FERDIAH.,"With Uatha, and with Aife, thou wert then"
2498,FERDIAH.,"My page to spread my couch for me at night,"
2499,FERDIAH.,"Or tie my spears together for the chase."""
2500,FERDIAH.,"""True hast thou spoken,"" said Cuchullin; ""yes,"
2501,FERDIAH.,"I then was young, thy junior, and I did"
2502,FERDIAH.,For thee the services thou dost recall;
2503,FERDIAH.,A different story shall be told of us
2504,FERDIAH.,"From this day forth, for on this day I feel"
2505,FERDIAH.,"Earth holds no champion that I dare not fight!"""
2506,FERDIAH.,"And thus invectives bitter, sharp and cold,"
2507,FERDIAH.,"Between the two were uttered, and first spake"
2508,FERDIAH.,"Ferdiah, then alternate each with each."
2509,FERDIAH.,
2510,FERDIAH.,FERDIAH.
2511,FERDIAH.,
2512,FERDIAH.,"What has brought thee here, O Hound,"
2513,FERDIAH.,To encounter a strong foe?
2514,FERDIAH.,O'er the trappings of thy steeds
2515,FERDIAH.,Crimson-red thy blood shall flow.
2516,FERDIAH.,"Woe is in thy journey, woe;"
2517,FERDIAH.,Let the cunning leech prepare;
2518,FERDIAH.,"Shouldst thou ever reach thy home,"
2519,FERDIAH.,Thou shalt need his care.
2520,FERDIAH.,
2521,CUCHULLIN.,CUCHULLIN.
2522,CUCHULLIN.,
2523,CUCHULLIN.,"I, who here with warriors fought,"
2524,CUCHULLIN.,"With the lordly chiefs of hosts,"
2525,CUCHULLIN.,"With a hundred men at once,"
2526,CUCHULLIN.,Little heed thy empty boasts.
2527,CUCHULLIN.,"Thee beneath the wave to place,"
2528,CUCHULLIN.,Thee to strike and thee to slay
2529,CUCHULLIN.,In the first path of our fight
2530,CUCHULLIN.,Am I here to-day.
2531,CUCHULLIN.,
2532,FERDIAH.,FERDIAH.
2533,FERDIAH.,
2534,FERDIAH.,"Thy reproach in me behold,"
2535,FERDIAH.,"For 'tis I that deed will do,"
2536,FERDIAH.,'Tis of me that Fame shall tell
2537,FERDIAH.,He the Ultonian's champion slew.
2538,FERDIAH.,"Yes, in spite of all their hosts,"
2539,FERDIAH.,"Yes, in spite of all their prayers:"
2540,FERDIAH.,So it shall long be told
2541,FERDIAH.,That the loss was theirs.
2542,FERDIAH.,
2543,CUCHULLIN.,CUCHULLIN.
2544,CUCHULLIN.,
2545,CUCHULLIN.,"How, then, shall we first engage--"
2546,CUCHULLIN.,Is it with the hard-edged sword?
2547,CUCHULLIN.,In what order shall we go
2548,CUCHULLIN.,To the battle of the Ford?
2549,CUCHULLIN.,Shall we in our chariots ride?
2550,CUCHULLIN.,Shall we wield the bloody spear?
2551,CUCHULLIN.,How am I to hew thee down
2552,CUCHULLIN.,With thy proud hosts here?
2553,CUCHULLIN.,
2554,FERDIAH.,FERDIAH.
2555,FERDIAH.,
2556,FERDIAH.,"Ere the setting of the sun,"
2557,FERDIAH.,"Ere shall come the darksome night,"
2558,FERDIAH.,"If again thou must be told,"
2559,FERDIAH.,With a mountain thou shalt fight:
2560,FERDIAH.,"Thee the Ultonians will extol,"
2561,FERDIAH.,"Thence impetuous wilt thou grow,"
2562,FERDIAH.,"Oh! their grief, when through their ranks"
2563,FERDIAH.,Will thy spectre go!
2564,FERDIAH.,
2565,CUCHULLIN.,CUCHULLIN.
2566,CUCHULLIN.,
2567,CUCHULLIN.,"Thou hast fallen in danger's gap,"
2568,CUCHULLIN.,"Yes, thy end of life is nigh;"
2569,CUCHULLIN.,Sharp spears shall be plied on thee
2570,CUCHULLIN.,Fairly 'neath the open sky:
2571,CUCHULLIN.,Pompous thou wilt be and vain
2572,CUCHULLIN.,"Till the time for talk is o'er,"
2573,CUCHULLIN.,From this day a battle-chief
2574,CUCHULLIN.,Thou shalt be no more.
2575,CUCHULLIN.,
2576,FERDIAH.,FERDIAH.
2577,FERDIAH.,
2578,FERDIAH.,"Cease thy boastings, for the world"
2579,FERDIAH.,Sure no braggart hath like thee:
2580,FERDIAH.,Thou art not the chosen chief--
2581,FERDIAH.,Thou hast not the champion's fee:--
2582,FERDIAH.,"Without action, without force,"
2583,FERDIAH.,Thou art but a giggling page;
2584,FERDIAH.,"Yes, thou trembler, with thy heart"
2585,FERDIAH.,Like a bird's in cage.
2586,FERDIAH.,
2587,CUCHULLIN.,CUCHULLIN.
2588,CUCHULLIN.,
2589,CUCHULLIN.,"When we were with Scatha once,"
2590,CUCHULLIN.,It but seemed our valour's due
2591,CUCHULLIN.,"That we should together fight,"
2592,CUCHULLIN.,Both as one our sports pursue.
2593,CUCHULLIN.,"Thou wert then my dearest friend,"
2594,CUCHULLIN.,"Comrade, kinsman, thou wert all,--"
2595,CUCHULLIN.,"Ah, how sad, if by my hand"
2596,CUCHULLIN.,Thou at last should fall.
2597,CUCHULLIN.,
2598,FERDIAH.,FERDIAH.
2599,FERDIAH.,
2600,FERDIAH.,"Much of honour shalt thou lose,"
2601,FERDIAH.,We may then mere words forego:--
2602,FERDIAH.,On a stake thy head shall be
2603,FERDIAH.,Ere the early cock shall crow.
2604,FERDIAH.,"O Cuchullin, Cuailgne's pride,"
2605,FERDIAH.,Grief and madness round thee twine;
2606,FERDIAH.,"I will do thee every ill,"
2607,FERDIAH.,For the fault is thine.
2608,FERDIAH.,
2609,FERDIAH.,"""Good, O Ferdiah, 'twas no knightly act,"""
2610,FERDIAH.,"Cuchullin said, ""to have come meanly here,"
2611,FERDIAH.,"To combat and to fight with an old friend,"
2612,FERDIAH.,"Through instigation of the wily Mave,"
2613,FERDIAH.,Through intermeddling of Ailill the king;
2614,FERDIAH.,To none of those who here before thee came
2615,FERDIAH.,"Was victory given, for they all fell by me:--"
2616,FERDIAH.,"Thou too shalt win nor victory, nor increase"
2617,FERDIAH.,"Of fame in this encounter thou dost dare,"
2618,FERDIAH.,"For as they fell, so thou by me shall fall."""
2619,FERDIAH.,"Thus was he saying and he spake these words,"
2620,FERDIAH.,"To which Ferdiah listened, not unmoved."

2622,CUCHULLIN.,CUCHULLIN.
2623,CUCHULLIN.,
2624,CUCHULLIN.,"Come not to me, O champion of the host,"
2625,CUCHULLIN.,"Come not to me, Ferdiah, as my foe,"
2626,CUCHULLIN.,"For though it is thy fate to suffer most,"
2627,CUCHULLIN.,"All, all must feel the universal woe."
2628,CUCHULLIN.,
2629,CUCHULLIN.,"Come not to me defying what is right,"
2630,CUCHULLIN.,"Come not to me, thy life is in my power;"
2631,CUCHULLIN.,"Ah, the dread issue of each former fight"
2632,CUCHULLIN.,Why hast thou not remembered ere this hour?
2633,CUCHULLIN.,
2634,CUCHULLIN.,"Art thou not bright with diverse dainty arms,"
2635,CUCHULLIN.,A purple girdle and a coat of mail?
2636,CUCHULLIN.,And yet to win the maid of peerless charms
2637,CUCHULLIN.,For whom thou dar'st the battle thou shalt fail.
2638,CUCHULLIN.,
2639,CUCHULLIN.,"Yes, Finavair, the daughter of the queen,"
2640,CUCHULLIN.,"The faultless form, the gold without alloy,"
2641,CUCHULLIN.,"The glorious virgin of majestic mien,"
2642,CUCHULLIN.,"Shalt not be thine, Ferdiah, to enjoy."
2643,CUCHULLIN.,
2644,CUCHULLIN.,"No, the great prize shall not by thee be won,--"
2645,CUCHULLIN.,"A fatal lure, a false, false light is she,"
2646,CUCHULLIN.,"To numbers promised and yet given to none,"
2647,CUCHULLIN.,And wounding many as she now wounds thee.
2648,CUCHULLIN.,
2649,CUCHULLIN.,"Break not thy vow, never with me to fight,"
2650,CUCHULLIN.,"Break not the bond that once thy young heart gave,"
2651,CUCHULLIN.,"Break not the truth we both so loved to plight,"
2652,CUCHULLIN.,"Come not to me, O champion bold and brave!"
2653,CUCHULLIN.,
2654,CUCHULLIN.,To fifty champions by her smiles made slaves
2655,CUCHULLIN.,"The maid was proffered, and not slight the gift;"
2656,CUCHULLIN.,"By me they have been sent into their graves,"
2657,CUCHULLIN.,From me they met destruction sure and swift.
2658,CUCHULLIN.,
2659,CUCHULLIN.,"Though vauntingly Ferbaeth my arms defied,"
2660,CUCHULLIN.,"He of a house of heroes prince and peer,"
2661,CUCHULLIN.,Short was the time until I tamed his pride
2662,CUCHULLIN.,With one swift cast of my true battle-spear.
2663,CUCHULLIN.,
2664,CUCHULLIN.,Srub Daire's valour too had swift decline:
2665,CUCHULLIN.,"Hundreds of women's secrets he possessed,"
2666,CUCHULLIN.,"Great at one time was his renown as thine,"
2667,CUCHULLIN.,"In cloth of gold, not silver, was he dressed."
2668,CUCHULLIN.,
2669,CUCHULLIN.,Though 'twas to me the woman was betrothed
2670,CUCHULLIN.,"On whom the chiefs of the fair province smile,"
2671,CUCHULLIN.,To shed thy blood my spirit would have loathed
2672,CUCHULLIN.,"East, west, or north, or south of all the isle."
2673,CUCHULLIN.,
2674,CUCHULLIN.,"""Good, O Ferdiah,"" still continuing, spoke"
2675,CUCHULLIN.,"Cuchullin, ""thus it is that thou shouldst not"
2676,CUCHULLIN.,Have come with me to combat and to fight;
2677,CUCHULLIN.,"For when we were with Scatha, long ago,"
2678,CUCHULLIN.,"With Uatha and with Aife, we were wont"
2679,CUCHULLIN.,"To go together to each battle-field,"
2680,CUCHULLIN.,"To every combat and to every fight,"
2681,CUCHULLIN.,"Through every forest, every wilderness,"
2682,CUCHULLIN.,"Through every darksome path and dangerous way."""
2683,CUCHULLIN.,And thus he said and thus he spake these words:
2684,CUCHULLIN.,
2685,CUCHULLIN.,CUCHULLIN.
2686,CUCHULLIN.,
2687,CUCHULLIN.,"We were heart-comrades then,--"
2688,CUCHULLIN.,"Comrades in crowds of men,"
2689,CUCHULLIN.,"In the same bed have lain,"
2690,CUCHULLIN.,When slumber sought us;
2691,CUCHULLIN.,"In countries far and near,"
2692,CUCHULLIN.,"Hurling the battle spear,"
2693,CUCHULLIN.,"Chasing the forest deer,"
2694,CUCHULLIN.,As Scatha taught us.
2695,CUCHULLIN.,
2696,CUCHULLIN.,"""O Cuchullin of the beautiful feats,"""
2697,CUCHULLIN.,"Replied Ferdiah, ""though we have pursued"
2698,CUCHULLIN.,"Together thus the arts of war and peace,"
2699,CUCHULLIN.,And though the bonds of friendship that we swore
2700,CUCHULLIN.,"Thou hast recalled to mind, from me shall come"
2701,CUCHULLIN.,"Thy first of wounds.  O Hound, remember not"
2702,CUCHULLIN.,"Our old companionship, which shall not now"
2703,CUCHULLIN.,"Avail thee, shall avail thee not, O Hound!"""
2704,CUCHULLIN.,"""Too long here have we waited in this way,"""
2705,CUCHULLIN.,"Again resumed Ferdiah.  ""To what arms,"
2706,CUCHULLIN.,"Say then, Cuchullin, shall we now resort?"""
2707,CUCHULLIN.,"""The choice of arms is thine until the night,"""
2708,CUCHULLIN.,"Cuchullin made reply; ""for so it chanced"
2709,CUCHULLIN.,"That thou shouldst be the first to reach the Ford."""
2710,CUCHULLIN.,"""Dost thou at all remember,"" then rejoined"
2711,CUCHULLIN.,"Ferdiah, ""those swift missive spears with which"
2712,CUCHULLIN.,"We practised oft with Scatha in our youth,"
2713,CUCHULLIN.,"With Uatha and with Aife, and our friends?"""
2714,CUCHULLIN.,"""Them I, indeed, remember well,"" replied"
2715,CUCHULLIN.,"Cuchullin.  ""If thou dost remember well,"
2716,CUCHULLIN.,"Let us to them resort,"" Ferdiah said."
2717,CUCHULLIN.,Their missive weapons then on either side
2718,CUCHULLIN.,They both resorted to.  Upon their arms
2719,CUCHULLIN.,"They braced two emblematic missive shields,"
2720,CUCHULLIN.,"And their eight well-turned-handled lances took,"
2721,CUCHULLIN.,"Their eight quill-javelins also, and their eight"
2722,CUCHULLIN.,"White ivory-hilted swords, and their eight spears,"
2723,CUCHULLIN.,"Sharp, ivory-hafted, with hard points of steel."
2724,CUCHULLIN.,"Betwixt the twain the darts went to and fro,"
2725,CUCHULLIN.,Like bees upon the wing on a fine day;
2726,CUCHULLIN.,No cast was made that was not sure to hit.
2727,CUCHULLIN.,"From morn to nigh mid-day the missiles flew,"
2728,CUCHULLIN.,Till on the bosses of the brazen shields
2729,CUCHULLIN.,"Their points were blunted, but though true the aim,"
2730,CUCHULLIN.,"And excellent the shooting, the defence"
2731,CUCHULLIN.,"Was so complete that not a wound was given,"
2732,CUCHULLIN.,And neither champion drew the other's blood.
2733,CUCHULLIN.,"""'Tis time to drop these feats,"" Ferdiah said,"
2734,CUCHULLIN.,"""For not by such as these shall we decide"
2735,CUCHULLIN.,"Our battle here this day.""  ""Let us desist,"""
2736,CUCHULLIN.,"Cuchullin answered, ""if the time hath come."""
2737,CUCHULLIN.,"They ceased, and threw their missile shafts aside"
2738,CUCHULLIN.,Into the hands of their two charioteers.
2739,CUCHULLIN.,"""What weapons, O Cuchullin, shall we now"
2740,CUCHULLIN.,"Resort to?"" said Ferdiah.  ""Unto thee,"""
2741,CUCHULLIN.,"Cuchullin answered, ""doth belong the choice"
2742,CUCHULLIN.,"Of arms until the night, because thou wert"
2743,CUCHULLIN.,"The first that reached the Ford.""  ""Well, let us, then,"""
2744,CUCHULLIN.,"Ferdiah said, ""resume our straight, smooth, hard,"
2745,CUCHULLIN.,"Well-polished spears with their hard flaxen strings."""
2746,CUCHULLIN.,"""Let us resume them, then,"" Cuchullin said."
2747,CUCHULLIN.,"They braced upon their arms two stouter shields,"
2748,CUCHULLIN.,"And then resorted to their straight, smooth, hard,"
2749,CUCHULLIN.,"Well-polished spears, with their hard flaxen strings.[50]"
2750,CUCHULLIN.,"'Twas now mid-day, and thus 'till eventide"
2751,CUCHULLIN.,They shot against each other with the spears.
2752,CUCHULLIN.,"But though the guard was good on either side,"
2753,CUCHULLIN.,The shooting was so perfect that the blood
2754,CUCHULLIN.,"Ran from the wounds of each, by each made red."
2755,CUCHULLIN.,"""Let us now, O Cuchullin,"" interposed"
2756,CUCHULLIN.,"Ferdiah, ""for the present time desist."""
2757,CUCHULLIN.,"""Let us indeed desist,"" Cuchullin said"
2758,CUCHULLIN.,"""If, O Ferdiah, the fit time hath come."""
2759,CUCHULLIN.,"They ceased, and laid their gory weapons down,"
2760,CUCHULLIN.,Their faithful charioteers' attendant care.
2761,CUCHULLIN.,"Each to the other gently then approached,"
2762,CUCHULLIN.,"Each round the other's neck his hands entwined,"
2763,CUCHULLIN.,And gave him three fond kisses on the cheek.
2764,CUCHULLIN.,"Their horses fed in the same field that night,"
2765,CUCHULLIN.,"Their charioteers were warmed at the same fire,"
2766,CUCHULLIN.,Their charioteers beneath their bodies spread
2767,CUCHULLIN.,"Green rushes, and beneath the heads the down"
2768,CUCHULLIN.,Of wounded men's soft pillows.  Then the skilled
2769,CUCHULLIN.,Professors of the art of healing came
2770,CUCHULLIN.,"With herbs, which to the scars of all their wounds"
2771,CUCHULLIN.,They put.  Of every herb and healing plant
2772,CUCHULLIN.,"That to Cuchullin's wound they did apply,"
2773,CUCHULLIN.,He would an equal portion westward send
2774,CUCHULLIN.,"Over the Ford, Ferdiah's wounds to heal."
2775,CUCHULLIN.,"So that the men of Erin could not say,"
2776,CUCHULLIN.,"If it should chance Ferdiah fell by him,"
2777,CUCHULLIN.,That it was through superior skill and care
2778,CUCHULLIN.,Cuchullin was enabled him to slay.
2779,CUCHULLIN.,
2780,CUCHULLIN.,"Of each kind, too, of palatable food"
2781,CUCHULLIN.,"And sweet, intoxicating, pleasant drink,"
2782,CUCHULLIN.,"The men of Erin to Ferdiah sent,"
2783,CUCHULLIN.,He a fair moiety across the Ford
2784,CUCHULLIN.,"Sent northward to Cuchullin, where he lay;"
2785,CUCHULLIN.,Because his own purveyors far surpassed
2786,CUCHULLIN.,In numbers those the Ulster chief retained:
2787,CUCHULLIN.,For all the federate hosts of Erin were
2788,CUCHULLIN.,"Purveyors to Ferdiah, with the hope"
2789,CUCHULLIN.,That he would beat Cuchullin from the Ford.
2790,CUCHULLIN.,"The Bregians[51] only were Cuchullin's friends,"
2791,CUCHULLIN.,"His sole purveyors, and their wont it was"
2792,CUCHULLIN.,To come to him and talk to him at night.
2793,CUCHULLIN.,
2794,CUCHULLIN.,That night they rested there.  Next morn they rose
2795,CUCHULLIN.,And to the Ford of battle early came.
2796,CUCHULLIN.,"""What weapons shall we use to-day?"" inquired"
2797,CUCHULLIN.,"Cuchullin.  ""Until night the choice is thine,"""
2798,CUCHULLIN.,"Replied Ferdiah; ""for the choice of arms"
2799,CUCHULLIN.,"Has hitherto been mine.""  ""Then let us take"
2800,CUCHULLIN.,"Our great broad spears to-day,"" Cuchullin said,"
2801,CUCHULLIN.,"""And may the thrusting bring us to an end"
2802,CUCHULLIN.,Sooner than yesterday's less powerful darts.
2803,CUCHULLIN.,Let then our charioteers our horses yoke
2804,CUCHULLIN.,"Beneath our chariots, so that we to-day"
2805,CUCHULLIN.,"May from our horses and our chariots fight."""
2806,CUCHULLIN.,"Ferdiah answered:  ""Let it so be done."""
2807,CUCHULLIN.,"And then they braced their two broad, full-firm shields"
2808,CUCHULLIN.,"Upon their arms that day, and in their hands"
2809,CUCHULLIN.,That day they took their great broad-bladed spears.
2810,CUCHULLIN.,And thus from early morn to evening's close
2811,CUCHULLIN.,They smote each other with such dread effect
2812,CUCHULLIN.,"That both were pierced, and both made red with gore,--"
2813,CUCHULLIN.,"Such wounds, such hideous clefts in either breast"
2814,CUCHULLIN.,"Lay open to the back, that if the birds"
2815,CUCHULLIN.,"Cared ever through men's wounded frames to pass,"
2816,CUCHULLIN.,"They might have passed that day, and with them borne"
2817,CUCHULLIN.,Pieces of quivering flesh into the air.
2818,CUCHULLIN.,"When evening came, their very steeds were tired,"
2819,CUCHULLIN.,"Their charioteers depressed, and they themselves"
2820,CUCHULLIN.,Worn out--even they the champions bold and brave.
2821,CUCHULLIN.,"""Let us from this, Ferdiah, now desist,"""
2822,CUCHULLIN.,"Cuchullin said; ""for see, our charioteers"
2823,CUCHULLIN.,"Droop, and our very horses flag and fail,"
2824,CUCHULLIN.,"And when fatigued they yield, so well may we."""
2825,CUCHULLIN.,"And further thus he spoke, persuading rest:--"
2826,CUCHULLIN.,
2827,CUCHULLIN.,CUCHULLIN.
2828,CUCHULLIN.,
2829,CUCHULLIN.,Not with the obstinate rage and spite
2830,CUCHULLIN.,With which Fomorian pirates fight
2831,CUCHULLIN.,"Let us, since now has fallen the night,"
2832,CUCHULLIN.,Continue thus our feud;
2833,CUCHULLIN.,"In brief abeyance it may rest,"
2834,CUCHULLIN.,Now that a calm comes o'er each breast:--
2835,CUCHULLIN.,"When with new light the world is blest,"
2836,CUCHULLIN.,"Be it again renewed."""
2837,CUCHULLIN.,
2838,CUCHULLIN.,"""Let us desist, indeed,"" Ferdiah said,"
2839,CUCHULLIN.,"""If the fit time hath come.""--And so they ceased."
2840,CUCHULLIN.,From them they threw their arms into the hands
2841,CUCHULLIN.,Of their two charioteers.  Each of them came
2842,CUCHULLIN.,Forward to meet the other.  Each his hands
2843,CUCHULLIN.,"Put round the other's neck, and thus embraced,"
2844,CUCHULLIN.,Gave to him three fond kisses on the cheek.
2845,CUCHULLIN.,Their horses fed in the same field that night;
2846,CUCHULLIN.,Their charioteers were warmed by the same fire.
2847,CUCHULLIN.,Their charioteers beneath their bodies spread
2848,CUCHULLIN.,"Green rushes, and beneath their heads the down"
2849,CUCHULLIN.,Of wounded men's soft pillows.  Then the skilled
2850,CUCHULLIN.,Professors of the art of healing came
2851,CUCHULLIN.,To tend them and to cure them through the night.
2852,CUCHULLIN.,"But they for all their skill could do no more,"
2853,CUCHULLIN.,"So numerous and so dangerous were the wounds,"
2854,CUCHULLIN.,"The cuts, and clefts, and scars so large and deep,"
2855,CUCHULLIN.,But to apply to them the potent charms
2856,CUCHULLIN.,"Of witchcraft, incantations, and barb spells,"
2857,CUCHULLIN.,"As sorcerers use, to stanch the blood and stay"
2858,CUCHULLIN.,The life that else would through the wounds escape:--
2859,CUCHULLIN.,"Of every charm of witchcraft, every spell,"
2860,CUCHULLIN.,Of every incantation that was used
2861,CUCHULLIN.,"To heal Cuchullin's wounds, a full fair half"
2862,CUCHULLIN.,Over the Ford was westward sent to heal
2863,CUCHULLIN.,"Ferdiah's hurts: of every sort of food,"
2864,CUCHULLIN.,"And sweet, intoxicating, pleasant drink"
2865,CUCHULLIN.,"The men of Erin to Ferdiah sent,"
2866,CUCHULLIN.,He a fair moiety across the Ford
2867,CUCHULLIN.,"Sent northward to Cuchullin where he lay,"
2868,CUCHULLIN.,Because his own purveyors far surpassed
2869,CUCHULLIN.,In number those the Ulster chief retained.
2870,CUCHULLIN.,For all the federate hosts of Erin were
2871,CUCHULLIN.,"Purveyors to Ferdiah, with the hope"
2872,CUCHULLIN.,That he would beat Cuchullin from the Ford.
2873,CUCHULLIN.,The Bregians only were Cuchullin's friends--

2875,CUCHULLIN.,"To come to him, and talk with him at night."
2876,CUCHULLIN.,
2877,CUCHULLIN.,"They rested there that night.  Next morn they rose,"
2878,CUCHULLIN.,And to the Ford of battle forward came.
2879,CUCHULLIN.,"That day a great, ill-favoured, lowering cloud"
2880,CUCHULLIN.,Upon Ferdiah's face Cuchullin saw.
2881,CUCHULLIN.,"""Badly,"" said he, ""dost thou appear this day,"
2882,CUCHULLIN.,"Ferdiah, for thy hair has duskier grown"
2883,CUCHULLIN.,"This day, and a dull stupour dims thine eyes,"
2884,CUCHULLIN.,"And thine own face and form, and what thou wert"
2885,CUCHULLIN.,"In outward seeming have deserted thee."""
2886,CUCHULLIN.,"""'Tis not through fear of thee that I am so,"""
2887,CUCHULLIN.,"Ferdiah said, ""for Erin doth not hold"
2888,CUCHULLIN.,"This day a champion I could not subdue."""
2889,CUCHULLIN.,"And thus betwixt the twain this speech arose,"
2890,CUCHULLIN.,And thus Cuchullin mourned and he replied:
2891,CUCHULLIN.,
2892,CUCHULLIN.,CUCHULLIN.
2893,CUCHULLIN.,
2894,CUCHULLIN.,"O Ferdiah, if it be thou,"
2895,CUCHULLIN.,Certain am I that on thy brow
2896,CUCHULLIN.,"The blush should burn and the shame should rise,"
2897,CUCHULLIN.,"Degraded man whom the gods despise,"
2898,CUCHULLIN.,Here at a woman's bidding to wend
2899,CUCHULLIN.,To fight thy fellow-pupil and friend.
2900,CUCHULLIN.,
2901,FERDIAH.,FERDIAH.
2902,FERDIAH.,
2903,FERDIAH.,"O Cuchullin, O valiant man,"
2904,FERDIAH.,"Inflicter of wounds since the war began,"

2906,FERDIAH.,"To the fated spot of his final home,--"
2907,FERDIAH.,To the sod predestined by fate's decree

2970,CUCHULLIN.,For feats of valour no strength have I
2971,CUCHULLIN.,To fight the fight where my friend must die.
2972,CUCHULLIN.,
2973,CUCHULLIN.,"""A truce to these invectives,"" then broke in"
2974,CUCHULLIN.,"Ferdiah; ""we far other work this day"
2975,CUCHULLIN.,Have yet to do than rail with woman's words.
2976,CUCHULLIN.,"Say, what shall be our arms in this day's fight?"""
2977,CUCHULLIN.,"""Till night,"" Cuchullin said, ""the choice is thine,"
2978,CUCHULLIN.,"For yester morn the choice was given to me."""
2979,CUCHULLIN.,"""Let us,"" Ferdiah answered, ""then resort"
2980,CUCHULLIN.,"Unto our heavy, sharp, hard-smiting swords,"
2981,CUCHULLIN.,For we are nearer to the end to-day
2982,CUCHULLIN.,"Of this our fight, by hewing, than we were"
2983,CUCHULLIN.,"On yesterday by thrusting of the spears."""
2984,CUCHULLIN.,"""So let us do, indeed,"" Cuchullin said."
2985,CUCHULLIN.,"Then on their arms two long great shields they took,"
2986,CUCHULLIN.,"And in their hands their sharp, hard-smiting swords."
2987,CUCHULLIN.,Each hewed the other with such furious strokes
2988,CUCHULLIN.,That pieces larger than an infant's head
2989,CUCHULLIN.,Of four weeks' old were cut from out the thighs
2990,CUCHULLIN.,And great broad shoulder-blades of each brave chief.
2991,CUCHULLIN.,And thus they persevered from early morn
2992,CUCHULLIN.,Till evening's close in hewing with the swords.
2993,CUCHULLIN.,"""Let us desist,"" at length Ferdiah said."
2994,CUCHULLIN.,"""Let us indeed desist, if the fit time"
2995,CUCHULLIN.,"Hath come,"" Cuchullin said; and so they ceased."
2996,CUCHULLIN.,From them they cast their arms into the hands
2997,CUCHULLIN.,Of their two charioteers; and though that morn
2998,CUCHULLIN.,"Their meeting was of two high-spirited men,"
2999,CUCHULLIN.,"Their separation, now that night had come,"
3000,CUCHULLIN.,Was of two men dispirited and sad.
3001,CUCHULLIN.,"Their horses were not in one field that night,"
3002,CUCHULLIN.,Their charioteers were warmed not at one fire.
3003,CUCHULLIN.,"That night they rested there, and in the morn"
3004,CUCHULLIN.,Ferdiah early rose and sought alone
3005,CUCHULLIN.,"The Ford of battle, for he knew that day"
3006,CUCHULLIN.,"Would end the fight, and that the hour drew nigh"
3007,CUCHULLIN.,When one or both of them should surely fall.
3008,CUCHULLIN.,
3009,CUCHULLIN.,Then was it for the first time he put on
3010,CUCHULLIN.,"His battle suit of battle and of fight,"
3011,CUCHULLIN.,Before Cuchullin came unto the Ford.
3012,CUCHULLIN.,That battle suit of battle and of fight
3013,CUCHULLIN.,"Was this:  His apron of white silk, with fringe"
3014,CUCHULLIN.,"Of spangled gold around it, he put on"
3015,CUCHULLIN.,"Next his white skin.  A leather apron then,"
3016,CUCHULLIN.,"Well sewn, upon his body's lower part"
3017,CUCHULLIN.,"He placed, and over it a mighty stone"
3018,CUCHULLIN.,As large as any mill-stone was secured.
3019,CUCHULLIN.,"His firm, deep, iron apron then he braced"
3020,CUCHULLIN.,Over the mighty stone--an apron made
3021,CUCHULLIN.,Of iron purified from every dross--
3022,CUCHULLIN.,Such dread had he that day of the Gaebulg.
3023,CUCHULLIN.,His crested helm of battle on his head
3024,CUCHULLIN.,He last put on--a helmet all ablaze
3025,CUCHULLIN.,"From forty gems in each compartment set,"
3026,CUCHULLIN.,"Cruan, and crystal, carbuncles of fire,"
3027,CUCHULLIN.,And brilliant rubies of the Eastern world.
3028,CUCHULLIN.,"In his right hand a mighty spear he seized,"
3029,CUCHULLIN.,"Destructive, sharply-pointed, straight and strong:--"
3030,CUCHULLIN.,"On his left side his sword of battle swung,"
3031,CUCHULLIN.,"Curved, with its hilt and pommel of red gold."
3032,CUCHULLIN.,Upon the slope of his broad back he placed
3033,CUCHULLIN.,"His dazzling shield, around whose margin rose"
3034,CUCHULLIN.,"Fifty huge bosses, each of such a size"
3035,CUCHULLIN.,"That on it might a full-grown hog recline,"
3036,CUCHULLIN.,Exclusive of the larger central boss
3037,CUCHULLIN.,That raised its prominent round of pure red gold.
3038,CUCHULLIN.,
3039,CUCHULLIN.,"Full many noble, varied, wondrous feats"
3040,CUCHULLIN.,"Ferdiah on that day displayed, which he"
3041,CUCHULLIN.,"Had never learned at any tutor's hand,"
3042,CUCHULLIN.,"From Uatha, or from Aife, or from her,"
3043,CUCHULLIN.,"Scatha, his early nurse in lonely Skye:--"
3044,CUCHULLIN.,But which were all invented by himself
3045,CUCHULLIN.,"That day, to bring about Cuchullin's fall."
3046,CUCHULLIN.,
3047,CUCHULLIN.,Cuchullin to the Ford approached and saw
3048,CUCHULLIN.,"The many noble, varied, wondrous feats"
3049,CUCHULLIN.,Ferdiah on that day displayed on high.
3050,CUCHULLIN.,"""O Laegh, my friend,"" Cuchullin thus addressed"
3051,CUCHULLIN.,"His charioteer, ""I see the wondrous feats"
3052,CUCHULLIN.,Ferdiah doth display on high to-day:
3053,CUCHULLIN.,"All these on me in turn shall soon be tried,"
3054,CUCHULLIN.,"And therefore note, that if it so should chance"
3055,CUCHULLIN.,"I shall be first to yield, be sure to taunt,"
3056,CUCHULLIN.,"Excite, revile me, and reproach me so,"
3057,CUCHULLIN.,That wrath and rage in me may rise the more:--
3058,CUCHULLIN.,"If I prevail, then let thy words be praise,"
3059,CUCHULLIN.,"Laud me, congratulate me, do thy best"
3060,CUCHULLIN.,"To stimulate my courage to its height."""
3061,CUCHULLIN.,"""It shall be done, Cuchullin,"" Laegh replied."
3062,CUCHULLIN.,
3063,CUCHULLIN.,Then was it that Cuchullin first assumed
3064,CUCHULLIN.,His battle suit of battle: then he tried
3065,CUCHULLIN.,"Full many, various, noble, wondrous feats"
3066,CUCHULLIN.,"He never learned from any tutor's hands,"
3067,CUCHULLIN.,"From Uatha, or from Aife, or from her,"
3068,CUCHULLIN.,"Scatha, his early nurse in lonely Skye."
3069,CUCHULLIN.,"Ferdiah saw these various feats, and knew"
3070,CUCHULLIN.,Against himself they soon would be applied.
3071,CUCHULLIN.,
3072,CUCHULLIN.,"""Say, O Ferdiah, to what arms shall we"
3073,CUCHULLIN.,"Resort in this day's fight?"" Cuchullin said."
3074,CUCHULLIN.,"Ferdiah answered, ""Unto thee belongs"
3075,CUCHULLIN.,"The choice of weapons now until the night."""
3076,CUCHULLIN.,"""Let us then try the Ford Feat on this day,"""
3077,CUCHULLIN.,"Replied Cuchullin.  ""Let us then, indeed,"""
3078,CUCHULLIN.,"Rejoined Ferdiah, with a careless air"
3079,CUCHULLIN.,"Consenting, though in truth it was to him"
3080,CUCHULLIN.,"The cause of grief to say so, since he knew"
3081,CUCHULLIN.,"That in the Ford Feat lay Cuchullin's strength,"
3082,CUCHULLIN.,And that he never failed to overthrow
3083,CUCHULLIN.,Champion or hero in that last appeal.
3084,CUCHULLIN.,
3085,CUCHULLIN.,Great was the feat that was performed that day
3086,CUCHULLIN.,"In and beside the Ford: the mighty two,"
3087,CUCHULLIN.,"The two great heroes, warriors, champions, chiefs"
3088,CUCHULLIN.,Of western Europe--the two open hands
3089,CUCHULLIN.,"Laden with gifts of the north-western world,--"
3090,CUCHULLIN.,The two beloved pillars that upheld
3091,CUCHULLIN.,The valour of the Gaels--the two strong keys
3092,CUCHULLIN.,That kept the bravery of the Gaels secure--
3093,CUCHULLIN.,Thus to be brought together from afar
3094,CUCHULLIN.,To fight each other through the meddling schemes
3095,CUCHULLIN.,Of Ailill and his wily partner Mave.
3096,CUCHULLIN.,From each to each the missive weapons flew
3097,CUCHULLIN.,From dawn of early morning to mid-day;
3098,CUCHULLIN.,"And when mid-day had come, the ire of both"
3099,CUCHULLIN.,"Became more furious, and they drew more near."
3100,CUCHULLIN.,Then was it that Cuchullin made a spring
3101,CUCHULLIN.,"From the Ford's brink, and came upon the boss"
3102,CUCHULLIN.,"Of the great shield Ferdiah's arm upheld,"
3103,CUCHULLIN.,"That thus he might, above the broad shield's rim,"
3104,CUCHULLIN.,Strike at his head.  Ferdiah with a touch
3105,CUCHULLIN.,"Of his left elbow, gave the shield a shake"
3106,CUCHULLIN.,"And cast Cuchullin from him like a bird,"
3107,CUCHULLIN.,Back to the brink of the Ford.  Again he sprang
3108,CUCHULLIN.,"From the Ford's brink, and came upon the boss"
3109,CUCHULLIN.,"Of the great shield once more, to strike his head"
3110,CUCHULLIN.,Over the rim.  Ferdiah with a stroke
3111,CUCHULLIN.,"Of his left knee made the great shield to ring,"
3112,CUCHULLIN.,"And cast Cuchullin back upon the brink,"
3113,CUCHULLIN.,As if he only were a little child.
3114,CUCHULLIN.,"Laegh saw the act.  ""Alas! indeed,"" said Laegh,"
3115,CUCHULLIN.,"""The warrior casts thee from him in the way"
3116,CUCHULLIN.,That an abandoned woman would her child.
3117,CUCHULLIN.,He flings thee as a river flings its foam;
3118,CUCHULLIN.,He grinds thee as a mill would grind fresh malt;
3119,CUCHULLIN.,He fells thee as the axe does fell the oak;
3120,CUCHULLIN.,He binds thee as the woodbine binds the tree;
3121,CUCHULLIN.,He darts upon thee as a hawk doth dart
3122,CUCHULLIN.,"Upon small birds, so that from this hour forth"
3123,CUCHULLIN.,"Until the end of time, thou hast no claim"
3124,CUCHULLIN.,Or title to be called a valorous man:
3125,CUCHULLIN.,"Thou little puny phantom form,"" said Laegh."
3126,CUCHULLIN.,"Then with the rapid motion of the wind,"
3127,CUCHULLIN.,"The fleetness of a swallow on the wing,"
3128,CUCHULLIN.,"The fierceness of a dragon, and the strength"
3129,CUCHULLIN.,"Of a roused lion, once again up sprang"
3130,CUCHULLIN.,"Cuchullin, high into the troubled air,"
3131,CUCHULLIN.,And lighted for the third time on the boss
3132,CUCHULLIN.,"Of the broad shield, to strike Ferdiah's head"
3133,CUCHULLIN.,"Over the rim.  The warrior shook the shield,"
3134,CUCHULLIN.,"And cast Cuchullin mid-way in the Ford,"
3135,CUCHULLIN.,With such an easy effort that it seemed
3136,CUCHULLIN.,As if he scarcely deigned to shake him off.
3137,CUCHULLIN.,
3138,CUCHULLIN.,"Then, as he lay, a strange distortion came"
3139,CUCHULLIN.,Upon Cuchullin; as a bladder swells
3140,CUCHULLIN.,"Inflated by the breath, to such a size"
3141,CUCHULLIN.,"And fulness did he grow, that he became"
3142,CUCHULLIN.,"A fearful, many-coloured, wondrous Tuaig--"
3143,CUCHULLIN.,"Gigantic shape, as big as a man of the sea,"
3144,CUCHULLIN.,"Or monstrous Fomor, so that now his form"
3145,CUCHULLIN.,In perfect height over Ferdiah stood.
3146,CUCHULLIN.,
3147,CUCHULLIN.,"So close the fight was now, that their heads met"
3148,CUCHULLIN.,"Above, their feet below, their arms half-way"
3149,CUCHULLIN.,Over the rims and bosses of their shields:--
3150,CUCHULLIN.,"So close the fight was now, that from their rims"
3151,CUCHULLIN.,"Unto their centres were their shields cut through,"
3152,CUCHULLIN.,And loosed was every rivet from its hold;
3153,CUCHULLIN.,"So close the fight was now, that their strong spears"
3154,CUCHULLIN.,Were turned and bent and shivered point and haft;
3155,CUCHULLIN.,Such was the closeness of the fight they made
3156,CUCHULLIN.,That the invisible and unearthly hosts
3157,CUCHULLIN.,"Of Spirits, Bocanachs and Bananachs,"
3158,CUCHULLIN.,And the wild wizard people of the glen
3159,CUCHULLIN.,"And of the air the demons, shrieked and screamed"
3160,CUCHULLIN.,"From their broad shields' reverberating rim,"
3161,CUCHULLIN.,From their sword-hilts and their long-shafted spears:
3162,CUCHULLIN.,"Such was the closeness of the fight they made,"
3163,CUCHULLIN.,"They forced the river from its natural course,"
3164,CUCHULLIN.,"Out of its bed, so that it might have been"
3165,CUCHULLIN.,"A couch whereon a king or queen might lie,"
3166,CUCHULLIN.,"For not a drop of water it retained,"
3167,CUCHULLIN.,Except what came from the great tramp and splash
3168,CUCHULLIN.,Of the two heroes fighting in its midst.
3169,CUCHULLIN.,"Such was the fierceness of the fight they waged,"
3170,CUCHULLIN.,That a wild fury seized upon the steeds
3171,CUCHULLIN.,The Gaels had gathered with them; in affright
3172,CUCHULLIN.,"They burst their traces and their binding ropes,"
3173,CUCHULLIN.,"Nay even their chains, and panting fled away."
3174,CUCHULLIN.,"The women, too, and youths, by equal fears"
3175,CUCHULLIN.,"Inspired and scared, and all the varied crowd"
3176,CUCHULLIN.,Of followers and non-combatants who there
3177,CUCHULLIN.,"Were with the men of Erin, from the camp"
3178,CUCHULLIN.,"South-westward broke away, and fled the Ford."
3179,CUCHULLIN.,
3180,CUCHULLIN.,At the edge-feat of swords they were engaged
3181,CUCHULLIN.,"When this surprise occurred, and it was then"
3182,CUCHULLIN.,Ferdiah an unguarded moment found
3183,CUCHULLIN.,"Upon Cuchullin, and he struck him deep,"
3184,CUCHULLIN.,Plunging his straight-edged sword up to the hilt
3185,CUCHULLIN.,"Within his body, till his girdle filled"
3186,CUCHULLIN.,"With blood, and all the Ford ran red with gore"
3187,CUCHULLIN.,From the brave battle-warrior's veins outshed.
3188,CUCHULLIN.,This could Cuchullin now no longer bear
3189,CUCHULLIN.,Because Ferdiah still the unguarded spot
3190,CUCHULLIN.,"Struck and re-struck with quick, strong, stubborn strokes;"
3191,CUCHULLIN.,"And so he called aloud to Laegh, the son"
3192,CUCHULLIN.,"Of Riangabra, for the dread Gaebulg."
3193,CUCHULLIN.,The manner of that fearful feat was this:
3194,CUCHULLIN.,"Adown the current was it sent, and caught"
3195,CUCHULLIN.,Between the toes: a single spear would make
3196,CUCHULLIN.,"The wound it made when entering, but once lodged"
3197,CUCHULLIN.,"Within the body, thirty barbs outsprung,"
3198,CUCHULLIN.,So that it could not be withdrawn until
3199,CUCHULLIN.,The body was cut open where it lay.
3200,CUCHULLIN.,And when of the Gaebulg Ferdiah heard
3201,CUCHULLIN.,"The name, he made a downward stroke of his shield,"
3202,CUCHULLIN.,To guard his body.  Then Cuchullin thrust
3203,CUCHULLIN.,"The unerring thorny spear straight o'er the rim,"
3204,CUCHULLIN.,"And through the breast-plate of his coat of mail,"
3205,CUCHULLIN.,So that its farther half was seen beyond
3206,CUCHULLIN.,"His body, after passing through his heart."
3207,CUCHULLIN.,
3208,CUCHULLIN.,"Ferdiah gave an upward stroke of his shield,"
3209,CUCHULLIN.,"His breast to cover, though it was ""the relief"
3210,CUCHULLIN.,"After the danger.""  Then the servant set"
3211,CUCHULLIN.,The dread Gaebulg adown the flowing stream;
3212,CUCHULLIN.,"Cuchullin caught it firmly 'twixt his toes,"
3213,CUCHULLIN.,And from his foot a fearful cast he threw
3214,CUCHULLIN.,Upon Ferdiah with unerring aim.
3215,CUCHULLIN.,Swift through the well-wrought iron apron guard
3216,CUCHULLIN.,"It passed, and through the stone which was as large"
3217,CUCHULLIN.,"As a huge mill-stone, cracking it in three,"
3218,CUCHULLIN.,"And so into his body, every part"
3219,CUCHULLIN.,Of which was filled with the expanding barbs
3220,CUCHULLIN.,"""That is enough: by that one blow I fall,"""
3221,CUCHULLIN.,"Ferdiah said.  ""Indeed, I now may own"
3222,CUCHULLIN.,"That I am sickly after thee this day,"
3223,CUCHULLIN.,Though it behoved not thee that I should fall
3224,CUCHULLIN.,"By stroke of thine;"" and then these dying words"
3225,CUCHULLIN.,"He added, tottering back upon the bank:"
3226,CUCHULLIN.,
3227,FERDIAH.,FERDIAH.
3228,FERDIAH.,
3229,FERDIAH.,"O Hound, so famed for deeds of valour doing,"
3230,FERDIAH.,'Twas not thy place my death to give to me;
3231,FERDIAH.,"Thine is the fault of my most certain ruin,"
3232,FERDIAH.,And yet 'tis best to have my blood on thee.
3233,FERDIAH.,
3234,FERDIAH.,"The wretch escapes not from his false position,"
3235,FERDIAH.,Who to the gap of his destruction goes;
3236,FERDIAH.,"Alas! my death-sick voice needs no physician,"
3237,FERDIAH.,My end hath come--my life's stream seaward flows.
3238,FERDIAH.,
3239,FERDIAH.,"The natural ramparts of my breast are broken,"
3240,FERDIAH.,In its own gore my struggling heart is drowned:--
3241,FERDIAH.,"Alas! I have not fought as I have spoken,"
3242,FERDIAH.,"For thou hast killed me in the fight, O Hound!"
3243,FERDIAH.,
3244,FERDIAH.,"Cuchullin towards him ran, and his two arms"
3245,FERDIAH.,"Clasping about him, lifted him and bore"
3246,FERDIAH.,The body in its armour and its clothes
3247,FERDIAH.,"Across the Ford unto the northern bank,"
3248,FERDIAH.,In order that the slain should thus be placed
3249,FERDIAH.,"Upon the north bank of the Ford, and not"
3250,FERDIAH.,"Among the men of Erin, on the west."
3251,FERDIAH.,"Cuchullin laid Ferdiah down, and then"
3252,FERDIAH.,"A sudden trance, a faintness on him came"
3253,FERDIAH.,When bending o'er the body of his friend.
3254,FERDIAH.,"Laegh saw the weakness, which was seen as well"
3255,FERDIAH.,"By all the men of Erin, who arose"
3256,FERDIAH.,Upon the moment to attack him there.
3257,FERDIAH.,"""Good, O Cuchullin,"" Laegh exclaimed, ""arise,"
3258,FERDIAH.,For all the men of Erin hither come.
3259,FERDIAH.,"It is no single combat they will give,"
3260,FERDIAH.,"Since fair Ferdiah, Daman's son, the son"
3261,FERDIAH.,"Of Dare, by thy hands has here been slain."""
3262,FERDIAH.,"""O servant, what availeth me to rise,"""
3263,FERDIAH.,"Cuchullin said, ""since he hath fallen by me?"""
3264,FERDIAH.,"And so the servant said, and so replied"
3265,FERDIAH.,"Cuchullin, in his turn, unto the end;"
3266,FERDIAH.,
3267,LAEGH.,LAEGH.
3268,LAEGH.,
3269,LAEGH.,"Arise, Emania's slaughter-hound, arise,"
3270,LAEGH.,Exultant pride should be thy mood this day:--
3271,LAEGH.,Ferdiah of the hosts before thee lies--
3272,LAEGH.,Hard was the fight and dreadful was the fray.
3273,LAEGH.,
3274,CUCHULLIN.,CUCHULLIN.
3275,CUCHULLIN.,
3276,CUCHULLIN.,"Ah, what availeth me a hero's pride?"
3277,CUCHULLIN.,"Madness and grief are in my heart and brain,"
3278,CUCHULLIN.,For the dear blood with which my hand is dyed--
3279,CUCHULLIN.,For the dear body that I here have slain.
3280,CUCHULLIN.,
3281,LAEGH.,LAEGH.
3282,LAEGH.,
3283,LAEGH.,"It suits thee ill to shed these idle tears,"
3284,LAEGH.,Fitter by far for thee a fiercer mood--
3285,LAEGH.,"At thee he flung the flying pointed spears,"
3286,LAEGH.,"Malicious, wounding, dripping, dyed with blood."
3287,LAEGH.,
3288,CUCHULLIN.,CUCHULLIN.
3289,CUCHULLIN.,
3290,CUCHULLIN.,"Even though he left me crippled, maimed, and lame,"
3291,CUCHULLIN.,"Even though I lost this arm that now but bleeds,"
3292,CUCHULLIN.,"All would I bear, but now the fields of fame"
3293,CUCHULLIN.,No more shall see Ferdiah mount his steeds.
3294,CUCHULLIN.,
3295,LAEGH.,LAEGH.
3296,LAEGH.,
3297,LAEGH.,"More pleasing is the victory thou hast gained,"
3298,LAEGH.,"More pleasing to the women of Creeve Rue,"
3299,LAEGH.,"He to have died and thou to have remained,"
3300,LAEGH.,To them the brave who fell here are too few.
3301,LAEGH.,
3302,LAEGH.,From that black day in brilliant Mave's long reign
3303,LAEGH.,Thou camest out of Cuailgne it has been--
3304,LAEGH.,Her people slaughtered and her champions slain--
3305,LAEGH.,A time of desolation to the queen.
3306,LAEGH.,
3307,LAEGH.,"When thy great plundered flock was borne away,"
3308,LAEGH.,"Thou didst not lie with slumber-seal`ed eyes,--"
3309,LAEGH.,Then 'twas thy boast to rise before the day:--
3310,LAEGH.,"Arise again, Emania's Hound, arise!"
3311,LAEGH.,
3312,LAEGH.,"So Laegh addressed the hero, though he seemed"
3313,LAEGH.,"To hear him not, but mourned his friend the more."
3314,LAEGH.,"And thus he spoke these words, and thus he moaned:"
3315,LAEGH.,
3316,LAEGH.,"""Alas! Ferdiah, an unhappy chance"
3317,LAEGH.,It was for thee that thou didst not consult
3318,LAEGH.,"Some of the heroes who my prowess knew,"
3319,LAEGH.,"Before thou camest forth to meet me here,"
3320,LAEGH.,In the hard battle combat by the Ford.
3321,LAEGH.,"Unhappy was it that it was not Laegh,"
3322,LAEGH.,"The son of Riangabra, thou didst ask"
3323,LAEGH.,About our fellow-pupilship--a bond
3324,LAEGH.,That might the unnatural combat so have stayed;
3325,LAEGH.,Unhappy was it that thou didst not ask
3326,LAEGH.,"Honest advice from Fergus, son of Roy;"
3327,LAEGH.,"Or that it was not battle-winning, proud,"
3328,LAEGH.,"Exulting, ruddy Connall thou didst ask"
3329,LAEGH.,About our fellow-pupilship of old.
3330,LAEGH.,For well do these men know there will not be
3331,LAEGH.,A being born among the Conacians who
3332,LAEGH.,Shall do the deeds of valour thou hast done
3333,LAEGH.,From this day forth until the end of time.
3334,LAEGH.,For if thou hadst consulted these brave men
3335,LAEGH.,"About the places where the assemblies meet,"
3336,LAEGH.,About the plightings and the broken vows
3337,LAEGH.,Uttered too oft by Connaught's fair-haired dames;
3338,LAEGH.,If thou hadst asked about the games and sports
3339,LAEGH.,"Played with the targe and shield, the sword and spear,"
3340,LAEGH.,"If of backgammon or the moves of chess,"
3341,LAEGH.,"Or races with the chariots and the steeds,"
3342,LAEGH.,They never would have found a champion's arm
3343,LAEGH.,"As strong to pierce a hero's flesh as thine,"
3344,LAEGH.,O rose-cloud hued Ferdiah!  None to raise
3345,LAEGH.,"The red-mouthed vulture's hoarse, inviting croak"
3346,LAEGH.,"Unto the many-coloured flocks, nor one"
3347,LAEGH.,"Who will for Croghan combat like to thee,"
3348,LAEGH.,"O red-cheeked son of Daman!""  Thus he said,"
3349,LAEGH.,Then standing o'er Ferdiah he resumed:
3350,LAEGH.,"""Oh! great has been the treachery and fraud"
3351,LAEGH.,"The men of Erin practised upon thee,"
3352,LAEGH.,"Ferdiah, thus to bring thee here to fight"
3353,LAEGH.,"With me, 'gainst whom it is no easy task"
3354,LAEGH.,"Upon the Tain Bo Cuailgne to contend."""
3355,LAEGH.,"And thus he said, and thus again he spake:"
3356,LAEGH.,
3357,CUCHULLIN.,CUCHULLIN.
3358,CUCHULLIN.,
3359,CUCHULLIN.,"O my Ferdiah, O my friend, forgive:"
3360,CUCHULLIN.,'Tis not my hand but treachery lays thee low:--
3361,CUCHULLIN.,"Thou doomed to die and I condemned to live,"
3362,CUCHULLIN.,Both doomed for ever to be severed so!
3363,CUCHULLIN.,
3364,CUCHULLIN.,"When we were far away in our young prime,"
3365,CUCHULLIN.,"With Scatha, dread Buannan's chosen friend,"
3366,CUCHULLIN.,"A vow we made, that till the end of time,"
3367,CUCHULLIN.,With hostile arms we never should contend.
3368,CUCHULLIN.,
3369,CUCHULLIN.,"Dear was thy lovely ruddiness to me,"
3370,CUCHULLIN.,"Dear was thy gray-blue eye, so bright and clear,--"
3371,CUCHULLIN.,"Thy comely, perfect form how sweet to see!"
3372,CUCHULLIN.,Thy wisdom and thy eloquence how dear!
3373,CUCHULLIN.,
3374,CUCHULLIN.,"In body-cutting combat, on the field"
3375,CUCHULLIN.,"Of spears, when all is lost or all is won,"
3376,CUCHULLIN.,"None braver ever yet held up a shield,"
3377,CUCHULLIN.,"Than thou, Ferdiah, Daman's ruddy son."
3378,CUCHULLIN.,
3379,CUCHULLIN.,"Never since Aife's only son I slew,"
3380,CUCHULLIN.,"Not knowing who the gallant youth might be,--"
3381,CUCHULLIN.,"Ah! hapless deed, that still my heart doth rue!--"
3382,CUCHULLIN.,"None have I found, Ferdiah, like to thee."
3383,CUCHULLIN.,
3384,CUCHULLIN.,"Thy dream it was to win fair Finavair,"
3385,CUCHULLIN.,From Mave her beauteous daughter's hand to gain;
3386,CUCHULLIN.,As soon might'st thou in the wide fields of air
3387,CUCHULLIN.,The glancing sunbeam's swift-winged flight restrain.

3400,CUCHULLIN.,Alas! O brooch of gold!
3401,CUCHULLIN.,"O chief, whose fame each poet knows,"
3402,CUCHULLIN.,"O hero of stout slaughtering blows,"
3403,CUCHULLIN.,Thy arm was brave and bold.

3733,THE VOCATION.,
3734,THE VOCATION.,"O Ita, mother of my heart and mind--"
3735,THE VOCATION.,"My nourisher, my fosterer, my friend,"
3736,THE VOCATION.,"Who taught me first to God's great will resigned,"
3737,THE VOCATION.,Before his shining altar-steps to bend;
3738,THE VOCATION.,"Who poured his word upon my soul like balm,"
3739,THE VOCATION.,And on mine eyes what pious fancy paints--
3740,THE VOCATION.,"And on mine ear the sweetly swelling psalm,"
3741,THE VOCATION.,And all the sacred knowledge of the saints;
3742,THE VOCATION.,
3743,THE VOCATION.,"To whom but thee, dear mother, should be told"
3744,THE VOCATION.,Of all the wonders I have seen afar?--
3745,THE VOCATION.,Islands more green and suns of brighter gold
3746,THE VOCATION.,Than this dear land or yonder blazing star;
3747,THE VOCATION.,"Of hills that bear the fruit-trees on their tops,"
3748,THE VOCATION.,And seas that dimple with eternal smiles;
3749,THE VOCATION.,"Of airs from heaven that fan the golden crops,"
3750,THE VOCATION.,O'er the great ocean 'mid the blessed isles!
3751,THE VOCATION.,
3752,THE VOCATION.,"Thou knowest, O my mother! how to thee"
3753,THE VOCATION.,"The blessed Ercus led me when a boy,"
3754,THE VOCATION.,"And how within thine arms and at thine knee,"
3755,THE VOCATION.,I learned the lore that death cannot destroy;
3756,THE VOCATION.,"And how I parted hence with bitter tears,"
3757,THE VOCATION.,"And felt, when turning from thy friendly door,"
3758,THE VOCATION.,"In the reality of ripening years,"
3759,THE VOCATION.,My paradise of childhood was no more.
3760,THE VOCATION.,
3761,THE VOCATION.,I wept--but not with sin such tear-drops flow;--
3762,THE VOCATION.,I sighed--for earthly things with heaven entwine;
3763,THE VOCATION.,"Tears make the harvest of the heart to grow,"
3764,THE VOCATION.,And love though human is almost divine.
3765,THE VOCATION.,The heart that loves not knows not how to pray;
3766,THE VOCATION.,The eye can never smile that never weeps:
3767,THE VOCATION.,'Tis through our sighs hope's kindling sunbeams play
3768,THE VOCATION.,And through our tears the bow of promise peeps.
3769,THE VOCATION.,
3770,THE VOCATION.,"I grew to manhood by the western wave,"
3771,THE VOCATION.,Among the mighty mountains on the shore:
3772,THE VOCATION.,"My bed the rock within some natural cave,"
3773,THE VOCATION.,My food whate'er the seas or seasons bore:
3774,THE VOCATION.,"My occupation, morn and noon and night:"
3775,THE VOCATION.,"The only dream my hasty slumbers gave,"
3776,THE VOCATION.,"Was Time's unheeding, unreturning flight,"
3777,THE VOCATION.,And the great world that lies beyond the grave.
3778,THE VOCATION.,
3779,THE VOCATION.,"And thus, where'er I went, all things to me"
3780,THE VOCATION.,Assumed the one deep colour of my mind;
3781,THE VOCATION.,"Great nature's prayer rose from the murmuring sea,"
3782,THE VOCATION.,And sinful man sighed in the wintry wind.
3783,THE VOCATION.,"The thick-veiled clouds by shedding many a tear,"
3784,THE VOCATION.,"Like penitents, grew purified and bright,"
3785,THE VOCATION.,"And, bravely struggling through earth's atmosphere,"
3786,THE VOCATION.,Passed to the regions of eternal light.
3787,THE VOCATION.,
3788,THE VOCATION.,"I loved to watch the clouds now dark and dun,"
3789,THE VOCATION.,"In long procession and funeral line,"
3790,THE VOCATION.,"Pass with slow pace across the glorious sun,"
3791,THE VOCATION.,Like hooded monks before a dazzling shrine.
3792,THE VOCATION.,And now with gentler beauty as they rolled
3793,THE VOCATION.,"Along the azure vault in gladsome May,"
3794,THE VOCATION.,"Gleaming pure white, and edged with broidered gold,"
3795,THE VOCATION.,Like snowy vestments on the Virgin's day.
3796,THE VOCATION.,
3797,THE VOCATION.,And then I saw the mighty sea expand
3798,THE VOCATION.,"Like Time's unmeasured and unfathomed waves,"
3799,THE VOCATION.,"One with its tide-marks on the ridgy sand,"
3800,THE VOCATION.,The other with its line of weedy graves;
3801,THE VOCATION.,"And as beyond the outstretched wave of time,"
3802,THE VOCATION.,"The eye of Faith a brighter land may meet,"
3803,THE VOCATION.,So did I dream of some more sunny clime
3804,THE VOCATION.,Beyond the waste of waters at my feet.
3805,THE VOCATION.,
3806,THE VOCATION.,"Some clime where man, unknowing and unknown,"
3807,THE VOCATION.,For God's refreshing word still gasps and faints;
3808,THE VOCATION.,"Or happier rather some Elysian zone,"
3809,THE VOCATION.,Made for the habitation of his saints:
3810,THE VOCATION.,"Where Nature's love the sweat of labour spares,"
3811,THE VOCATION.,"Nor turns to usury the wealth it lends,"
3812,THE VOCATION.,"Where the rich soil spontaneous harvest bears,"
3813,THE VOCATION.,And the tall tree with milk-filled clusters bends.
3814,THE VOCATION.,
3815,THE VOCATION.,"The thought grew stronger with my growing days,"
3816,THE VOCATION.,"Even like to manhood's strengthening mind and limb,"
3817,THE VOCATION.,And often now amid the purple haze
3818,THE VOCATION.,That evening breathed upon the horizon's rim--
3819,THE VOCATION.,"Methought, as there I sought my wished-for home,"
3820,THE VOCATION.,"I could descry amid the waters green,"
3821,THE VOCATION.,"Full many a diamond shrine and golden dome,"
3822,THE VOCATION.,And crystal palaces of dazzling sheen.
3823,THE VOCATION.,
3824,THE VOCATION.,"And then I longed, with impotent desire,"
3825,THE VOCATION.,"Even for the bow whereby the Python bled,"
3826,THE VOCATION.,That I might send on dart of the living fire
3827,THE VOCATION.,"Into that land, before the vision fled,"
3828,THE VOCATION.,"And thus at length fix the enchanted shore,"
3829,THE VOCATION.,"Hy-Brasail, Eden of the western wave!"
3830,THE VOCATION.,"That thou again wouldst fade away no more,"
3831,THE VOCATION.,Buried and lost within thy azure grave.
3832,THE VOCATION.,
3833,THE VOCATION.,"But angels came and whispered as I dreamt,"
3834,THE VOCATION.,"""This is no phantom of a frenzied brain--"
3835,THE VOCATION.,God shows this land from time to time to tempt
3836,THE VOCATION.,Some daring mariner across the main:
3837,THE VOCATION.,"By thee the mighty venture must be made,"
3838,THE VOCATION.,By thee shall myriad souls to Christ be won!
3839,THE VOCATION.,"Arise, depart, and trust to God for aid!"""
3840,THE VOCATION.,"I woke, and kneeling, cried, ""His will be done!"""

4084,THE BURIED CITY.,Her lustrous eyes were like the noon of night--
4085,THE BURIED CITY.,"Black, but yet brightened by a thousand stars;"
4086,THE BURIED CITY.,"Her tender form, moulded in modest grace,"
4087,THE BURIED CITY.,"Shrank from the gazer's eye, and moved apart;"
4088,THE BURIED CITY.,"Heaven shone reflected in her angel face,"
4089,THE BURIED CITY.,And God reposed within her virgin heart.
4090,THE BURIED CITY.,
4091,THE BURIED CITY.,"She dwelt in green Moyarta's pleasant land,"
4092,THE BURIED CITY.,"Beneath the graceful hills of Clonderlaw,--"
4093,THE BURIED CITY.,"Sweet sunny hills, whose triple summits stand,"
4094,THE BURIED CITY.,One vast tiara over stream and shaw.
4095,THE BURIED CITY.,"Almost in solitude the maiden grew,"
4096,THE BURIED CITY.,And reached her early budding woman's prime;
4097,THE BURIED CITY.,"And all so noiselessly the swift time flew,"
4098,THE BURIED CITY.,She knew not of the name or flight of Time.
4099,THE BURIED CITY.,
4100,THE BURIED CITY.,"And thus, within her modest mountain nest,"
4101,THE BURIED CITY.,"This gentle maiden nestled like a dove,"
4102,THE BURIED CITY.,Offering to God from her pure innocent breast
4103,THE BURIED CITY.,The sweet and silent incense of her love.
4104,THE BURIED CITY.,No selfish feeling nor presumptuous pride
4105,THE BURIED CITY.,In her calm bosom waged unnatural strife;
4106,THE BURIED CITY.,"Saint of her home and hearth, she sanctified"
4107,THE BURIED CITY.,The thousand trivial common cares of life.
4108,THE BURIED CITY.,
4109,THE BURIED CITY.,"Upon the opposite shore there dwelt a youth,"
4110,THE BURIED CITY.,Whose nature's woof was woven of good and ill--
4111,THE BURIED CITY.,"Whose stream of life flowed to the sea of truth,"
4112,THE BURIED CITY.,"But in a devious course, round many a hill--"
4113,THE BURIED CITY.,"Now lingering through a valley of delight,"
4114,THE BURIED CITY.,"Where sweet flowers bloomed, and summer songbirds sung,"
4115,THE BURIED CITY.,"Now hurled along the dark, tempestuous night,"
4116,THE BURIED CITY.,"With gloomy, treeless mountains overhung."
4117,THE BURIED CITY.,
4118,THE BURIED CITY.,"He sought the soul of Beauty throughout space,"
4119,THE BURIED CITY.,Knowledge he tracked through many a vanished age:
4120,THE BURIED CITY.,"For one he scanned fair Nature's radiant face,"
4121,THE BURIED CITY.,"And for the other, Learning's shrivelled page."
4122,THE BURIED CITY.,"If Beauty sent some fair apostle down,"
4123,THE BURIED CITY.,"Or Knowledge some great teacher of her lore,"
4124,THE BURIED CITY.,"Bearing the wreath of rapture and the crown,"
4125,THE BURIED CITY.,"He knelt to love, to learn, and to adore."
4126,THE BURIED CITY.,
4127,THE BURIED CITY.,"Full many a time he spread his little sail,"
4128,THE BURIED CITY.,"How rough the river, or how dark the skies,"
4129,THE BURIED CITY.,"Gave his light corrach to the angry gale,"
4130,THE BURIED CITY.,And crossed the stream to gaze on Ethna's eyes.
4131,THE BURIED CITY.,"As yet 'twas worship, more than human love,"
4132,THE BURIED CITY.,That hopeless adoration that we pay
4133,THE BURIED CITY.,"Unto some glorious planet throned above,"
4134,THE BURIED CITY.,Through severed from its crystal sphere for aye.
4135,THE BURIED CITY.,
4136,THE BURIED CITY.,"But warmer love an easy conquest won,"
4137,THE BURIED CITY.,The more he came to green Moyarta's bowers;
4138,THE BURIED CITY.,"Even as the earth, by gazing on the sun,"
4139,THE BURIED CITY.,In summer-time puts forth her myriad flowers.
4140,THE BURIED CITY.,"The yearnings of his heart--vague, undefined--"
4141,THE BURIED CITY.,"Wakened and solaced by ideal gleams,"
4142,THE BURIED CITY.,"Took everlasting shape, and intertwined"
4143,THE BURIED CITY.,Around this incarnation of his dreams.
4144,THE BURIED CITY.,
4145,THE BURIED CITY.,Some strange fatality restrained his tongue--
4146,THE BURIED CITY.,He spoke not of the love that filled his breast;
4147,THE BURIED CITY.,"The thread of hope, on which his whole life hung,"
4148,THE BURIED CITY.,Was far too weak to bear so strong a test.
4149,THE BURIED CITY.,"He trusted to the future--time, or chance--"
4150,THE BURIED CITY.,His constant homage and assiduous care;
4151,THE BURIED CITY.,"Preferred to dream, and lengthen out his trance,"
4152,THE BURIED CITY.,Rather than wake to knowledge and despair.
4153,THE BURIED CITY.,
4154,THE BURIED CITY.,"And thus she knew not, when the youth would look"
4155,THE BURIED CITY.,"Upon some pictured chronicle of eld,"
4156,THE BURIED CITY.,In every blazoned letter of the book
4157,THE BURIED CITY.,One fairest face was all that he beheld:
4158,THE BURIED CITY.,"And where the limner, with consummate art,"
4159,THE BURIED CITY.,"Drew flowing lines and quaint devices rare,"
4160,THE BURIED CITY.,"The wildered youth, by looking from the heart,"
4161,THE BURIED CITY.,Saw nought but lustrous eyes and waving hair.
4162,THE BURIED CITY.,
4163,THE BURIED CITY.,"He soon was startled from his dreams, for now--"
4164,THE BURIED CITY.,"'Twas said, obedient to a heavenly call--"
4165,THE BURIED CITY.,"His life of life would take the vestal vow,"
4166,THE BURIED CITY.,"In one short month, within a convent's wall."
4167,THE BURIED CITY.,"He heard the tidings with a sickening fear,"
4168,THE BURIED CITY.,"But quickly had the sudden faintness flown,"
4169,THE BURIED CITY.,"And vowed, though heaven or hell should interfere,"
4170,THE BURIED CITY.,Ethna--his Ethna--should be his alone!
4171,THE BURIED CITY.,
4172,THE BURIED CITY.,"He sought his boat, and snatched the feathery oar--"
4173,THE BURIED CITY.,It was the first and brightest morn of May:
4174,THE BURIED CITY.,"The white-winged clouds, that sought the northern shore,"
4175,THE BURIED CITY.,"Seemed but Love's guides, to point him out the way."
4176,THE BURIED CITY.,"The great old river heaved its mighty heart,"
4177,THE BURIED CITY.,"And, with a solemn sigh, went calmly on;"
4178,THE BURIED CITY.,"As if of all his griefs it felt a part,"
4179,THE BURIED CITY.,"But know they should be borne, and so had gone."
4180,THE BURIED CITY.,
4181,THE BURIED CITY.,"Slowly his boat the languid breeze obeyed,"
4182,THE BURIED CITY.,Although the stream that that light burden bore
4183,THE BURIED CITY.,"Was like the level path the angels made,"
4184,THE BURIED CITY.,"Through the rough sea, to Arran's blessed shore;"
4185,THE BURIED CITY.,"And from the rosy clouds the light airs fanned,"
4186,THE BURIED CITY.,"And from the rich reflection that they gave,"
4187,THE BURIED CITY.,"Like good Scothinus, had he reached his hand,"
4188,THE BURIED CITY.,He might have plucked a garland from the wave.
4189,THE BURIED CITY.,
4190,THE BURIED CITY.,"And now the noon in purple splendour blazed,"
4191,THE BURIED CITY.,The gorgeous clouds in slow procession filed;
4192,THE BURIED CITY.,The youth leaned o'er with listless eyes and gazed
4193,THE BURIED CITY.,Down through the waves on which the blue heavens smiled:
4194,THE BURIED CITY.,What sudden fear his gasping breath doth drown!
4195,THE BURIED CITY.,What hidden wonder fires his startled eyes!
4196,THE BURIED CITY.,"Down in the deep, full many a fathom down,"
4197,THE BURIED CITY.,A great and glorious city buried lies.
4198,THE BURIED CITY.,
4199,THE BURIED CITY.,"Not like those villages with rude-built walls,"
4200,THE BURIED CITY.,"That raise their humble roofs round every coast,"
4201,THE BURIED CITY.,"But holding marble basilics and halls,"
4202,THE BURIED CITY.,Such as imperial Rome herself might boast.
4203,THE BURIED CITY.,"There was the palace and the poor man's home,"
4204,THE BURIED CITY.,"And upstart glitter and old-fashioned gloom,"
4205,THE BURIED CITY.,"The spacious porch, the nicely rounded dome,"
4206,THE BURIED CITY.,"The hero's column, and the martyr's tomb."
4207,THE BURIED CITY.,
4208,THE BURIED CITY.,There was the cromleach with its circling stones;
4209,THE BURIED CITY.,There the green rath and the round narrow tower;
4210,THE BURIED CITY.,There was the prison whence the captive's groans
4211,THE BURIED CITY.,Had many a time moaned in the midnight hour.
4212,THE BURIED CITY.,"Beneath the graceful arch the river flowed,"
4213,THE BURIED CITY.,"Around the walls the sparkling waters ran,"
4214,THE BURIED CITY.,The golden chariot rolled along the road--
4215,THE BURIED CITY.,"All, all was there except the face of man."
4216,THE BURIED CITY.,
4217,THE BURIED CITY.,"The wondering youth had neither thought nor word,"
4218,THE BURIED CITY.,He felt alone the power and will to die;
4219,THE BURIED CITY.,"His little bark seemed like an outstretched bird,"
4220,THE BURIED CITY.,Floating along that city's azure sky.
4221,THE BURIED CITY.,"It joyed that youth the battle's storm to brave,"
4222,THE BURIED CITY.,"And yet he would have perished with affright,"
4223,THE BURIED CITY.,"Had not the breeze, rippling the lucid wave,"
4224,THE BURIED CITY.,Concealed the buried city from his sight.
4225,THE BURIED CITY.,
4226,THE BURIED CITY.,He reached the shore; the rumour was too true--
4227,THE BURIED CITY.,Ethna--his Ethna--would be God's alone
4228,THE BURIED CITY.,"In one brief month; for which the maid withdrew,"
4229,THE BURIED CITY.,To seek for strength before his blessed throne.
4230,THE BURIED CITY.,"Was it the fire that on his bosom preyed,"
4231,THE BURIED CITY.,"Or the temptation of the Fiend abhorred,"
4232,THE BURIED CITY.,That made him vow to snatch the white-veiled maid
4233,THE BURIED CITY.,Even from the very altar of her Lord?
4234,THE BURIED CITY.,
4235,THE BURIED CITY.,"The first of June, that festival of flowers,"
4236,THE BURIED CITY.,"Came, like a goddess, o'er the meadows green!"
4237,THE BURIED CITY.,And all the children of the spring-tide showers
4238,THE BURIED CITY.,Rose from their grassy beds to hail their Queen.
4239,THE BURIED CITY.,"A song of joy, a paean of delight,"
4240,THE BURIED CITY.,"Rose from the myriad life in the tall grass,"
4241,THE BURIED CITY.,"When the young Dawn, fresh from the sleep of night,"
4242,THE BURIED CITY.,Glanced at her blushing face in Ocean's glass.
4243,THE BURIED CITY.,
4244,THE BURIED CITY.,Ethna awoke--a second--brighter dawn--
4245,THE BURIED CITY.,Her mother's fondling voice breathed in her ear;
4246,THE BURIED CITY.,Quick from her couch she started as a fawn
4247,THE BURIED CITY.,Bounds from the heather when her dam is near.
4248,THE BURIED CITY.,Each clasped the other in a long embrace--
4249,THE BURIED CITY.,Each know the other's heart did beat and bleed--
4250,THE BURIED CITY.,"Each kissed the warm tears from the other's face,"
4251,THE BURIED CITY.,And gave the consolation she did need.
4252,THE BURIED CITY.,
4253,THE BURIED CITY.,Oh! bitterest sacrifice the heart can make--
4254,THE BURIED CITY.,That of a mother of her darling child--
4255,THE BURIED CITY.,"That of a child, who, for her Saviour's sake,"
4256,THE BURIED CITY.,Leaves the fond face that o'er her cradle smiled.
4257,THE BURIED CITY.,They who may think that God doth never need
4258,THE BURIED CITY.,"So great, so sad a sacrifice as this,"
4259,THE BURIED CITY.,"While they take glory in their easier creed,"
4260,THE BURIED CITY.,Will feel and own the sacrifice it is.
4261,THE BURIED CITY.,
4262,THE BURIED CITY.,All is prepared--the sisters in the choir--
4263,THE BURIED CITY.,The mitred abbot on his crimson throne--
4264,THE BURIED CITY.,"The waxen tapers, with their pallid fire"
4265,THE BURIED CITY.,Poured o'er the sacred cup and altar-stone--
4266,THE BURIED CITY.,"The upturned eyes, glistening with pious tears--"
4267,THE BURIED CITY.,The censer's fragrant vapour floating o'er;
4268,THE BURIED CITY.,"Now all is hushed, for, lo! the maid appears,"
4269,THE BURIED CITY.,Entering with solemn step the sacred door.
4270,THE BURIED CITY.,
4271,THE BURIED CITY.,"She moved as moves the moon, radiant and pale,"
4272,THE BURIED CITY.,"Through the calm night, wrapped in a silvery cloud;"
4273,THE BURIED CITY.,"The jewels of her dress shone through her veil,"
4274,THE BURIED CITY.,As shine the stars through their thin vaporous shroud;
4275,THE BURIED CITY.,The brighter jewels of her eyes were hid
4276,THE BURIED CITY.,"Beneath their smooth white caskets arching o'er,"
4277,THE BURIED CITY.,"Which, by the trembling of each ivory lid,"
4278,THE BURIED CITY.,Seemed conscious of the treasures that they bore.
4279,THE BURIED CITY.,
4280,THE BURIED CITY.,"She reached the narrow porch and the tall door,"
4281,THE BURIED CITY.,Her trembling foot upon the sill was placed--
4282,THE BURIED CITY.,Her snowy veil swept the smooth-sanded floor--
4283,THE BURIED CITY.,Her cold hands chilled the bosom they embraced.
4284,THE BURIED CITY.,"Who is this youth, whose forehead, like a book,"
4285,THE BURIED CITY.,Bears many a deep-traced character of pain?
4286,THE BURIED CITY.,Who looks for pardon as the damned may look--
4287,THE BURIED CITY.,"That ever pray, and know they pray in vain."
4288,THE BURIED CITY.,
4289,THE BURIED CITY.,"'Tis he, the wretched youth--the Demon's prey;"
4290,THE BURIED CITY.,"One sudden bound, and he is at her side--"
4291,THE BURIED CITY.,"One piercing shriek, and she has swooned away,"
4292,THE BURIED CITY.,"Dim are her eyes, and cold her heart's warm tide."
4293,THE BURIED CITY.,Horror and terror seize the startled crowd;
4294,THE BURIED CITY.,The sinewy hands are nerveless with affright;
4295,THE BURIED CITY.,"When, as the wind beareth a summer cloud,"
4296,THE BURIED CITY.,The youth bears off the maiden from their sight.
4297,THE BURIED CITY.,
4298,THE BURIED CITY.,"Close to the place the stream rushed roaring by,"
4299,THE BURIED CITY.,"His little boat lay moored beneath the bank,"
4300,THE BURIED CITY.,"Hid from the shore, and from the gazer's eye,"
4301,THE BURIED CITY.,By waving reeds and water-willows dank.
4302,THE BURIED CITY.,"Hither, with flying feet and glowing brow,"
4303,THE BURIED CITY.,"He fled, as quick as fancies in a dream--"
4304,THE BURIED CITY.,Placed the insensate maiden in the prow--
4305,THE BURIED CITY.,"Pushed from the shore, and gained the open stream."
4306,THE BURIED CITY.,
4307,THE BURIED CITY.,"Scarce had he left the river's foamy edge,"
4308,THE BURIED CITY.,When sudden darkness fell on hill and plain;
4309,THE BURIED CITY.,"The angry sun, shocked at the sacrilege,"
4310,THE BURIED CITY.,Fled from the heavens with all his golden train;
4311,THE BURIED CITY.,"The stream rushed quicker, like a man afeared;"
4312,THE BURIED CITY.,"Down swept the storm and clove its breast of green,"
4313,THE BURIED CITY.,And though the calm and brightness reappeared
4314,THE BURIED CITY.,The youth and maiden never more were seen.
4315,THE BURIED CITY.,
4316,THE BURIED CITY.,Whether the current in its strong arms bore
4317,THE BURIED CITY.,"Their bark to green Hy-Brasail's fairy halls,"
4318,THE BURIED CITY.,"Or whether, as is told along that shore,"
4319,THE BURIED CITY.,They sunk within the buried city's walls;
4320,THE BURIED CITY.,"Whether through some Elysian clime they stray,"
4321,THE BURIED CITY.,Or o'er their whitened bones the river rolls;--
4322,THE BURIED CITY.,"Whate'er their fate, my brothers, let us pray"
4323,THE BURIED CITY.,To God for peace and pardon to their souls.
4324,THE BURIED CITY.,
4325,THE BURIED CITY.,Such was the brother's tale of earthly love--
4326,THE BURIED CITY.,"He ceased, and sadly bowed his reverend head:"
4327,THE BURIED CITY.,"For us, we wept, and raised our eyes above,"
4328,THE BURIED CITY.,And sang the 'De Profundis' for the dead.
4329,THE BURIED CITY.,"A freshening breeze played on our moistened cheeks,"
4330,THE BURIED CITY.,"The far horizon oped its walls of light,"
4331,THE BURIED CITY.,And lo! with purple hills and sun-bright peaks
4332,THE BURIED CITY.,"A glorious isle gleamed on our gladdened sight,"
4333,THE BURIED CITY.,
4334,THE BURIED CITY.,
4335,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.

4342,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,"The freshest, sunniest, smiling land that e'er"
4343,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,Held o'er the waves its arms of sheltering green
4344,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,Unto the sea and storm-vexed mariner:--
4345,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,"No barren waste its gentle bosom scarred,"
4346,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,"Nor suns that burn, nor breezes winged with ice,"
4347,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,Nor jagged rocks (Nature's grey ruins) marred
4348,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,The perfect features of that Paradise.
4349,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,
4350,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,The verdant turf spreads from the crystal marge
4351,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,"Of the clear stream, up the soft-swelling hill,"
4352,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,Rose-bearing shrubs and stately cedars large
4353,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,All o'er the land the pleasant prospect fill.
4354,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,Unnumbered birds their glorious colours fling
4355,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,"Among the boughs that rustle in the breeze,"
4356,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,As if the meadow-flowers had taken wing
4357,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,And settled on the green o'er-arching trees.
4358,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,
4359,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,"Oh! Ita, Ita, 'tis a grievous wrong,"
4360,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,That man commits who uninspired presumes
4361,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,To sing the heavenly sweetness of their song--
4362,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,To paint the glorious tinting of their plumes--
4363,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,Plumes bright as jewels that from diadems
4364,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,Fling over golden thrones their diamond rays--
4365,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,"Bright, even as bright as those three mystic gems,"
4366,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,The angel bore thee in thy childhood's days.[60]
4367,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,
4368,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,There dwells the bird that to the farther west
4369,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,Bears the sweet message of the coming spring;[61]
4370,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,"June's blushing roses paint his prophet breast,"
4371,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,And summer skies gleam from his azure wing.
4372,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,"While winter prowls around the neighbouring seas,"
4373,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,"The happy bird dwells in his cedar nest,"
4374,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,"Then flies away, and leaves his favourite trees"

4381,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,There partial nature fondles and illumes
4382,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,The plainest offspring that her bosom bears;
4383,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,"The golden robin flies on fiery plumes,[65]"

4412,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,
4413,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,"Colour and form may be conveyed in words,"
4414,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,But words are weak to tell the heavenly strains
4415,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,That from the throats of these celestial birds
4416,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,Rang through the woods and o'er the echoing plains.
4417,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,"There was the meadow-lark, with voice as sweet,"

4425,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,Mocks all his brethren of the woodland bower;
4426,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,"To whom indeed the gift of tongues is given,"
4427,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,"The musical rich tongues that fill the grove,"
4428,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,"Now like the lark dropping his notes from heaven,"

4430,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,
4431,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,"Oft have I seen him, scorning all control,"
4432,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,"Winging his arrowy flight rapid and strong,"
4433,THE PARADISE OF BIRDS.,"As if in search of his evanished soul,"

10273,RECOLLECTIONS.,
10274,RECOLLECTIONS.,"Led by the bright and sun-warm air,"

10280,RECOLLECTIONS.,With countless roses lined;
10281,RECOLLECTIONS.,And where the apple still inclined

10283,RECOLLECTIONS.,
10284,RECOLLECTIONS.,"Near to the lilacs round the pond,"
10285,RECOLLECTIONS.,In its stone ring hard by

10288,RECOLLECTIONS.,
10289,RECOLLECTIONS.,"The garden wall, we nothing saw,"

10293,RECOLLECTIONS.,
10294,RECOLLECTIONS.,And in the shade we saw the face

10298,RECOLLECTIONS.,
10299,RECOLLECTIONS.,There through the pleasant noontide hours
10300,RECOLLECTIONS.,My task of echoed song I sung;

10338,RECOLLECTIONS.,
10339,RECOLLECTIONS.,And linger for the expected view--
10340,RECOLLECTIONS.,Day's dying gleam upon the hill;
10341,RECOLLECTIONS.,"Or listen for the whip-poor-will,[113]"
10342,RECOLLECTIONS.,Or the too seldom shy cuckoo.
