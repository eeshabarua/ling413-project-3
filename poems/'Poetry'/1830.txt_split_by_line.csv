17,MY DEAR BOOTH:,MY DEAR BOOTH:
18,MY DEAR BOOTH:,
19,MY DEAR BOOTH:,"In offering these verses to you, I beg you to treat them (as you"
20,MY DEAR BOOTH:,have many a time advised a certain lord chamberlain to treat the
21,MY DEAR BOOTH:,"players) not according to their desert.  ""Use them after your own"
22,MY DEAR BOOTH:,"honor and dignity; the less they deserve, the more merit is in your"
23,MY DEAR BOOTH:,"bounty."""

34,NOTE,The motif of the story embodied in the following poem was crudely
35,NOTE,outlined in a brief sketch printed in an early collection of the
36,NOTE,"authors verse, and subsequently cancelled for a purpose not until"
37,NOTE,now accomplished.  Wyndham Towers is not to be confused with this
38,NOTE,"discarded sketch, the text of which has furnished only a phrase, or"
39,NOTE,"an indirect suggestion, here and there.  That the writer's method,"
40,NOTE,"when recasting the poem, was more or less influenced by the poets"
41,NOTE,he had been studying--chiefly the dramatists of the Elizabethan
42,NOTE,"era--will, he hopes, be obvious.  It was part of his design,"
43,NOTE,"however far he may have fallen from it, to give his narrative"
44,NOTE,something of the atmosphere and color of the period in which the
45,NOTE,"action takes place, though the story is supposed to be told at a"
46,NOTE,later date.

51,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,WYNDHAM TOWERS.
52,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
53,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
54,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Before you reach the slender, high-arched bridge,"
55,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Like to a heron with one foot in stream,"
56,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The hamlet breaks upon you through green boughs--
57,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,A square stone church within a place of graves
58,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Upon the slope; gray houses oddly grouped,"
59,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"With plastered gables set with crossed oak-beams,"
60,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And roofs of yellow tile and purplish slate.
61,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"That is The Falcon, with the swinging sign"
62,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And rustic bench, an ancient hostelry;"
63,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Those leaden lattices were hung on hinge
64,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"In good Queen Bess's time, so old it is."
65,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"On ridge-piece, gable-end, or dove-cot vane,"
66,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,A gilded weathercock at intervals
67,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Glimmers--an angel on the wing, most like,"
68,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Of local workmanship; for since the reign
69,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Of pious Edward here have carvers thrived,"
70,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,In saints'-heads skillful and winged cherubim
71,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Meet for rich abbeys.  From yon crumbling tower,"
72,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Whose brickwork base the cunning Romans laid--
73,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And now of no use else except to train
74,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The ivy of an idle legend on--
75,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"You see, such lens is this thin Devon air,"
76,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"If it so chance no fog comes rolling in,"
77,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The Torridge where its branching crystal spreads
78,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,To join the Taw.  Hard by from a chalk cliff
79,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,A torrent leaps: not lovelier Sappho was
80,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Giving herself all silvery to the sea
81,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,From that Leucadian rock.  Beneath your feet
82,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Lie sand and surf in curving parallels.
83,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Off shore, a buoy gleams like a dolphin's back"
84,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Dripping with brine, and guards a sunken reef"
85,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Whose sharp incisors have gnawed many a keel;
86,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"There frets the sea and turns white at the lip,"
87,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And in ill-weather lets the ledge show fang.
88,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"A very pleasant nook in Devon, this,"
89,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
90,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Upon the height of old was Wyndham Towers,"
91,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Clinging to rock there, like an eagle's nest,"
92,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"With moat and drawbridge once, and good for siege;"
93,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Four towers it had to front the diverse winds:
94,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Built God knows when, all record being lost,"
95,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Locked in the memories of forgotten men.
96,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"In Caesar's day, a pagan temple; next"
97,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,A monastery; then a feudal hold;
98,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Later a manor, and at last a ruin."
99,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Such knowledge have we of it, vaguely caught"
100,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Through whispers fallen from tradition's lip.
101,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"This shattered tower, with crenellated top"
102,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And loops for archers, alone marks the spot,"
103,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Looming forlornly--a gigantic harp
104,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Whereon the invisible fingers of the wind
105,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Its fitful and mysterious dirges play.
106,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
107,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Here dwelt, in the last Tudor's virgin reign,"
108,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"One Richard Wyndham, Knight and Gentleman,"
109,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"(The son of Rawdon, slain near Calais wall"
110,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"When Bloody Mary lost her grip on France,)"
111,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,A lonely wight that no kith had nor kin
112,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Save one, a brother--by ill-fortune's spite"
113,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"A brother, since 't were better to have none--"
114,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Of late not often seen at Wyndham Towers,"
115,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Where he in sooth but lenten welcome got
116,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,When to that gate his errant footstep strayed.
117,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Yet held he dear those gray majestic walls,"
118,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Time-stained and crusted with the sea's salt breath;
119,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"There first his eyes took color of the sea,"
120,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"There did his heart stay when fate drove him thence,"
121,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And there at last--but that we tell anon.
122,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Darrell they named him, for an ancestor"
123,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Whose bones were whitening in Holy Land,"
124,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The other Richard; a crusader name,"
125,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Yet it was Darrell had the lion-heart.
126,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"No love and little liking served this pair,"
127,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,In look and word unpaired as white and black--
128,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Of once rich bough the last unlucky fruit.
129,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The one, for straightness like a Norland pine"
130,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Set on some precipice's perilous edge,"
131,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Intrepid, handsome, little past blown youth,"
132,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Of all pure thought and brave deed amorous,"
133,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Moulded the court's high atmosphere to breathe,"
134,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Yet liking well the camp's more liberal air--
135,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Poet, soldier, courtier, 't was the mode;"
136,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The other--as a glow-worm to a star--
137,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Suspicious, morbid, passionate, self-involved,"
138,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The soul half eaten out with solitude,"
139,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Corroded, like a sword-blade left in sheath"
140,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Asleep and lost to action--in a word,"
141,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"A misanthrope, a miser, a soured man,"
142,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,One fortune loved not and looked at askance.
143,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Yet he a pleasant outward semblance had.
144,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Say what you will, and paint things as you may,"
145,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The devil is not black, with horn and hoof,"
146,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,As gossips picture him: he is a person
147,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Quite scrupulous of doublet and demeanor,"
148,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"As was this Master Wyndham of The Towers,"
149,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Now latterly in most unhappy case,"
150,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Because of matters to be here set forth.
151,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
152,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"A thing of not much moment, as life goes,"
153,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,A thing a man with some philosophy
154,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Had idly brushed aside, as 't were a gnat"
155,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"That winged itself between him and the light,"
156,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Had, through the crooked working of his mind,"
157,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Brought Wyndham to a very grievous pass.
158,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Yet 't was a grapestone choked Anacreon
159,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And hushed his song.  There is no little thing
160,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,In nature: in a raindrop's compass lie
161,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,A planet's elements.  This Wyndham's woe
162,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Was one Griselda, daughter to a man"
163,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Of Bideford, a shipman once, but since"
164,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Turned soldier; now in white-haired, wrinkled age"
165,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Sitting beneath the olive, valiant still,"
166,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,With sword on nail above the chimney-shelf
167,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,In case the Queen should need its edge again.
168,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"An officer he was, though lowly born."
169,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The man aforetime, in the Netherlands"
170,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And through those ever-famous French campaigns
171,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"(Marry, in what wars bore he not a hand?)"
172,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"In Rawdon Wyndham's troop of horse had served,"
173,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And when he fell that day by Calais wall
174,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Had from the Frenchmen's pikes his body snatched,"
175,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And so much saved of him, which was not much,"
176,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The good knight being dead.  For this deed's sake,"
177,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"That did enlarge itself in sorrow's eye,"
178,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The widow deemed all guerdon all too small,"
179,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And held her dear lord's servant and his girl,"
180,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Born later, when that clash of steel was done,"
181,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"As her own kin, till she herself was laid"
182,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,I' the earth and sainted elsewhere.  The two sons
183,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Let cool the friendship: one in foreign parts
184,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Did gold and honor seek; at hall stayed one,"
185,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The heir, and now of old friends negligent:"
186,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Thus fortune hardens the ignoble heart.
187,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Griselda even as a little maid,"
188,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Demure, but with more crotchets in the brain,"
189,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"I warrant ye, than minutes to the hour,"
190,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Had this one much misliked; in her child-thought
191,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Confused him somehow with those cruel shapes
192,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Of iron men that up there at The Towers
193,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Quickened her pulse.  For he was gaunt, his face,"
194,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Mature beyond the logic of his years,"
195,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Had in it something sinister and grim,"
196,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Like to the visage pregnant fancy saw
197,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Behind the bars of each disused casque
198,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,In that east chamber where the harness hung
199,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And dinted shields of Wyndhams gone to grace--
200,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"At Poitiers this one, this at Agincourt,"
201,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,That other on the sands of Palestine:
202,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"A breed of fierce man-slayers, sire and son."
203,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Of these seemed Richard, with his steel cross-bow"
204,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Killing the doves in very wantonness--
205,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The gentle doves that to the ramparts came
206,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"For scattered crumbs, undreamful of all ill."
207,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Each well-sent dart that stained a snowy breast
208,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Straight to her own white-budding bosom went.
209,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Fled were those summers now, and she had passed"
210,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Out of the child-world of vain fantasy
211,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Where many a rainbow castle lay in ruin;
212,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"But to her mind, like wine-stain to a flask,"
213,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The old distrust still clung, indelible,"
214,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Holding her in her maidhood's serious prime
215,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Well pleased from his cold eyes to move apart,"
216,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And in her humble fortunes dwell secure.
217,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Indeed, what was she?--a poor soldier's girl,"
218,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Merely a tenant's daughter.  Times were changed,"
219,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And life's bright web had sadder colors in 't:
220,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,That most sweet gentle lady--rest her soul!--
221,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Shrunk to an epitaph beside her lord's,"
222,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And six lines shorter, which was all a shame;"
223,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Gaunt Richard heir; that other at earth's end,"
224,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"(The younger son that was her sweetheart once,)"
225,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Fighting the Spaniards, getting slain perchance;"
226,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And all dear old-time uses quite forgot.
227,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Slowly, unnoted, like the creeping rust"
228,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"That spreads insidious, had estrangement come,"
229,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Until at last, one knew not how it fell,"
230,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And little cared, if sober truth were said,"
231,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,She and the father no more climbed the hill
232,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"To Twelfth Night festival or May-day dance,"
233,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Nor commerce had with any at The Towers.
234,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Yet in a formless, misty sort of way"
235,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The girl had place in Wyndham's mind--the girl,"
236,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Why, yes, beshrew him! it was even she"
237,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Whom his soft mother had made favorite of,"
238,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And well-nigh spoiled, some dozen summers gone."
239,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
240,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Perhaps because dull custom made her tame,"
241,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Or that she was not comely in the bud,"
242,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Her sweetness halting like a tardy May
243,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"That wraps itself in mist, and seems not fair,"
244,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"For this or finer reason undivined,"
245,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"His thought she touched not, and was glad withal"
246,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,When she did note how others took his eye
247,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And wore rue after.  Thus was her white peace
248,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Undarkened till, it so befell, these two"
249,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Meeting as they a hundred times had met
250,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"On hill-path or at crossing of the weir,"
251,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Her beauty broke on him like some rare flower
252,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,That was not yesterday.  Ev'n so the Spring
253,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Unclasps the girdle of its loveliness
254,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Abruptly, in the North here: long the drifts"
255,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Linger in hollows, long on bough and briar"
256,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"No slight leaf ventures, lest the frost's keen tooth"
257,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Nip it, and then all suddenly the earth"
258,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Is nought but scent and bloom.  So unto him
259,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Griselda's grace unclosed.  Where lagged his wit
260,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"That guessed not of the bud that slept in stem,"
261,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Nor hint had of the flower within the bud?
262,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"If so much beauty had a tiger been,"
263,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,'T had eaten him!  In all the wave-washed length
264,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Of rocky Devon where was found her like
265,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,For excellence of wedded red and white?
266,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Here on that smooth and sunny field, her cheek,"
267,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The hostile hues of Lancaster and York
268,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Did meet, and, blending, make a heavenly truce,"
269,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,This were indeed a rose a king might wear
270,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Upon his bosom.  By St. Dunstan, now,"
271,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Himself would wear it.  Then by seeming chance
272,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Crossed he her walks, and stayed her with discourse"
273,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Devised adroitly; spoke of common things
274,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"At first--of days when his good mother lived,"
275,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"If 't were to live, to pass long dolorous hours"
276,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Before his father's effigy in church;
277,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Of one who then used often come to hall,"
278,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Ever at Yule-tide, when the great log flamed"
279,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"In chimney-place, and laugh and jest went round,"
280,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And maidens strayed beneath the mistletoe,"
281,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Making believe not see it, so got kissed--"
282,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Of one that joined not in the morrice-dance,"
283,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"But in her sea-green kirtle stood at gaze,"
284,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,A timid little creature that was scared
285,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"By dead men's armor.  Nought there suffered change,"
286,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Those empty shells of valor grew not old,"
287,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Though something rusty.  Would they fright her now
288,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Looked she upon them?  Held she in her mind--
289,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,'T was Spring and loud the mavis piped outside--
290,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The day the Turkish helmet slipped from peg,"
291,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And clashing on the floor, congealed her blood"
292,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And sent both hands to terror-smitten eyes,"
293,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"She trembling, ready to yield up the ghost?"
294,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Right merry was it!  Finally he touched
295,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"On matters nearer, things she had foreboded"
296,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And this one time must needs lend hearing to,"
297,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And end so sorry business ere woe came,"
298,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Like a true maid and honest, as she was."
299,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"So, tutoring the tremble on her lip"
300,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And holding back hot tears, she gave reply"
301,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"With such discretion as straight tied his tongue,"
302,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Albeit he lacked not boldness in discourse:
303,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
304,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"""Indeed, indeed, sir, you speak but in jest!"
305,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Lightly, not meaning it, in courtier-way."
306,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,I have heard said that ladies at the Court--
307,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"I judge them not!--have most forgiving ears,"
308,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And list right willingly to idle words,"
309,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Listen and smile and never stain a cheek.
310,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Yet not such words your father's son should use
311,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"With me, my father's daughter.  You forget"
312,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"What should most precious be to memory's heart,"
313,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Love that dared death; and so, farewell.""  Farewell"
314,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"It was in sooth; for after that one time,"
315,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Though he had fain with passion-breathed vows
316,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Besieged that marble citadel her breast,"
317,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,He got no speech of her: she chose her walks;
318,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Let only moon and star look on the face
319,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,That could well risk the candor of the sun;
320,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Ran not to lattice at each sound of hoof;
321,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"By stream or hedge-row plucked no pansies more,"
322,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Mistrusting Proserpina's cruel fate,"
323,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Herself up-gathered in Sicilian fields;
324,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,At chapel--for one needs to chapel go
325,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"A-Sunday--glanced not either right or left,"
326,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,But with black eyelash wedded to white cheek
327,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Knelt there impassive, like the marble girl"
328,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"That at the foot-end of his father's tomb,"
329,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Inside the chancel where the Wyndhams lay,"
330,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Through the long years her icy vigil kept.
331,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
332,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"As leaves turn into flame at the frost's touch,"
333,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"So Richard's heart on coldness fed its fire,"
334,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And burned with surfeit of indifference.
335,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,All flavor and complexion of content
336,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Went out of life; what served once served no more.
337,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,His hound and falcon ceased to pleasure him;
338,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,He read--some musty folios there were
339,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"On shelf--but even in brave Froissart's page,"
340,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Where, God knows, there be wounds enough, no herb"
341,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Nor potion found he to purge sadness with.
342,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The gray dust gathered on the leaf unturned,"
343,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And then the spider drew his thread across.
344,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Certain bright coins that he was used to count
345,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"With thrill at fingers' ends uncounted lay,"
346,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Suddenly worthless, like the conjurer's gold"
347,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,That midst the jeers and laughter of the crowd
348,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Turns into ashes in the rustic's hand.
349,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Soft idleness itself bore now a thorn
350,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Two-pronged with meditation and desire.
351,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The cold Griselda that would none of him!
352,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The fair Griselda!  Not alone by day,"
353,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"With this most solid earth beneath his feet,"
354,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,But in the weird and unsubstantial sphere
355,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Of slumber did her beauty hold him thrall.
356,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Herself of late he saw not; 't was a wraith
357,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"He worshipped, a vain shadow.  Thus he pined"
358,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"From dawn to dusk, and then from dusk to dawn,"
359,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Of that miraculous infection caught
360,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"From any-colored eyes, so they be sweet."
361,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Strange that a man should let a maid's slim foot
362,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Stamp on his happiness and quench it quite!
363,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
364,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,With what snail-pace the traitor time creeps by
365,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,When one is out with fortune and undone!
366,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,how tauntingly upon the dial's plate
367,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The shadow's finger points the dismal hour!
368,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Thus Wyndham, with hands clasped behind his back,"
369,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Watching the languid and reluctant sun
370,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Fade from the metal disk beside the door.
371,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The hours hung heavy up there on the hill,"
372,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Where life was little various at best
373,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And merriment had long since ta'en its flight.
374,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Sometimes he sat and conned the flying clouds
375,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Till on dusk's bosom nestled her one star,"
376,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And spoke no word, nor seemed alive at all,"
377,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,But a mere shape and counterfeit of life;
378,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Or, urged by some swift hunger for green boughs,"
379,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Would bid the hound to heel, and disappear"
380,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Into the forest, with himself communing"
381,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,For lack of gossip.  So do lonely men
382,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Make themselves tedious to their tedious selves.
383,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Thus passed he once in a white blaze of noon
384,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Under his oaks, and muttered as he went:"
385,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
386,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"""'My father's daughter' and 'your father's son'!"
387,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Faith, but it was a shrewd and nimble phrase,"
388,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And left me with no fitting word at tongue.
389,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The wench hath wit and matter of her own,"
390,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And beauty, that doth seldom mate with wit,"
391,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Nature hath painted her a proper brown--
392,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,A russet-colored wench that knows her worth.
393,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And mincing, too--should have her ruff propt up"
394,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"With supertasses, like a dame at Court,"
395,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And go in cloth-of-gold.  I'll get a suit
396,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Of Genoa velvet, and so take her eye."
397,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Has she a heart?  The ladies of Whitehall
398,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Are not so skittish, else does Darrell lie"
399,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Most villainously.  Often hath he said
400,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The art of blushing 's a lost art at Court.
401,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"If so, good riddance!  This one here lets love"
402,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Play beggar to her prudery, and starve,"
403,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Feeding him ever on looks turned aside.
404,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"To be so young, so fair, and wise withal!"
405,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Lets love starve?  Nay, I think starves merely me."
406,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,For when was ever woman logical
407,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Both day and night-time?  Not since Adam fell!
408,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,I doubt a lover somewhere.  What shrewd bee
409,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Hath buzzed betimes about this clover-top?
410,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Belike some scrivener's clerk at Bideford,"
411,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,With long goose-quill and inkhorn at his thigh--
412,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Methinks I see the parchment face of him;
413,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Or one of those swashbuckler Devon lads
414,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"That haunt the inn there, with red Spanish gold,"
415,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Rank scurvy knaves, ripe fruit for gallows-tree;"
416,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Or else the sexton's son""--here Wyndham laughed,"
417,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Though not a man of mirth--indeed, a man"
418,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Of niggard humor; but that sexton's son--
419,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Lean as the shadow cast by a church spire,"
420,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Eyes deep in the sockets, noseless, high cheek-boned,"
421,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Like nothing in the circle of this earth
422,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,But a death's-head that from a mural slab
423,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Within the chancel leers through sermon-time,"
424,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Making a mock of poor mortality.
425,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The fancy touched him, and he laughed a laugh"
426,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,That from his noonday slumber roused an owl
427,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Snug in his oaken hermitage hard by.
428,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,A very rare conceit--the sexton's son!
429,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
430,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Not he, forsooth; he smacked of churchyard mould"
431,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And musty odors of moth-eaten palls--
432,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"A living death, a walking epitaph!"
433,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,No lover that for tingling flesh and blood
434,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,To rest soft cheek on and change kisses with.
435,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Yet lover somewhere; from his sly cocoon
436,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Time would unshell him.  In the interim
437,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"What was to do but wait, and mark who strolled"
438,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Of evenings up the hill-path and made halt
439,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,This side the coppice at a certain gate?
440,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"For by that chance which ever serves ill ends,"
441,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Within the slanted shadow of The Towers
442,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The maid Griselda dwelt.  Her gray scarred sire
443,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Had for cloth doublet changed the steel cuirass,"
444,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The sword for gardener's fork, and so henceforth"
445,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"In the mild autumn and sundown of life,"
446,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Moving erect among his curves and squares
447,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Of lily, rose, and purple flower-de-luce,"
448,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Set none but harmless squadrons in the field--
449,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Save now and then at tavern, where he posed,"
450,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Tankard in hand and prattling of old days,"
451,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,A white-mustached epitome of wars.
452,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
453,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,How runs the proverb touching him who waits?
454,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Who waits shall have the world.  Time's heir is he,"
455,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Be he but patient.  Thus the thing befell
456,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Wherefrom grew all this history of woe:
457,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Haunting the grounds one night, as his use was"
458,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Who loved the dark as bats and owlets do,"
459,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Wyndham got sound of voices in the air
460,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,That did such strange and goblin changes ring
461,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"As left him doubtful whence the murmurs came,"
462,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Now here, now there, as they were winged things--"
463,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Such trick plays Echo upon hapless wight
464,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Chance-caught in lonely places where she dwells,"
465,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Anon a laugh rang out, melodious,"
466,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Like the merle's note when its ecstatic heart
467,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Is packed with summer-time; then all was still--
468,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,So still the soul of silence seemed to grieve
469,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The loss of that sweet laughter.  In his tracks
470,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The man stopped short, and listened.  As he leaned"
471,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And craned his neck, and peered into the gloom,"
472,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And would the fabulous hundred eyes were his
473,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"That Argus in the Grecian legend had,"
474,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,He saw two figures moving through a drift
475,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Of moonlight that lay stretched across the lawn:
476,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"A man's tall shape, a slim shape close at side,"
477,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Her palm in tender fashion pressed to his,"
478,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The woven snood about her shoulders fallen,"
479,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And from the sombre midnight of her hair
480,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,An ardent face out-looking like a star--
481,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"As in a vision saw he this, for straight"
482,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,They vanished.  Where those silvery shadows were
483,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Was nothing.  Had he dreamed it?  Had he gone
484,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Mad with much thinking on her, and so made"
485,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Ghosts of his own sick fancies?  Like a man
486,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Carved out of alabaster and set up
487,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Within a woodland, he stood rooted there,"
488,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Glimmering wanly under pendent boughs.
489,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Spell-bound he stood, in very woeful plight,"
490,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Bewildered; and then presently with shock
491,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Of rapid pulses hammering at heart,"
492,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"As mad besiegers hammer at a gate,"
493,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"To life came back, and turned on heel to fly"
494,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"From that accursed spot and all that was,"
495,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"When once more the girl's laugh made rich the night,"
496,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And melted, and the silence grieved anew."
497,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Like lead his feet were, and he needs must halt."
498,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Close upon this, but further off, a voice"
499,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,From somewhere--Echo at her trick again!--
500,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Took up the rhyme of Sweetheart, sigh no more."
501,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
502,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
503,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,It was with doubt and trembling
504,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,I whispered in her ear.
505,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Go, take her answer, bird-on-bough,"
506,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,That all the world may hear--
507,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Sweetheart, sigh no more!"
508,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
509,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Sing it, sing it, tawny throat,"
510,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Upon the wayside tree,"
511,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"How fair she is, how true she is,"
512,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,How dear she is to me--
513,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Sweetheart sigh no more!
514,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
515,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Sing it, sing it, tawny throat,"
516,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And through the summer long
517,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The winds among the clover-tops,"
518,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And brooks, for all their silvery stops,"
519,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Shall envy you the song--
520,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Sweetheart, sigh no more."
521,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
522,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
523,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,'T is said the Malays have an arrow steeped
524,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,In some strange drug whose subtile properties
525,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Are such that if the point but prick the skin
526,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Death stays there.  Like to that fell cruel shaft
527,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,This slender rhyme was.  Through the purple dark
528,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Straight home it sped, and into Wyndham's veins"
529,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Its drop of sudden poison did distill.
530,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Now no sound was, save when a dry twig snapped"
531,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And rustled softly down from branch to branch,"
532,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Or on its pebbly shoals the meagre brook
533,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Made intermittent murmur.  ""So, 't is he!"""
534,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Thus Wyndham breathing thickly, with his eyes"
535,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Dilating in the darkness, ""Darrell--he!"
536,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,I set my springe for other game than this;
537,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Of hare or rabbit dreamed I, not of wolf."
538,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,His frequent visitations have of late
539,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Perplexed me; now the riddle reads itself.
540,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"A proper man, a very proper man!"
541,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,A fellow that burns Trinidado leaf
542,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And sends smoke through his nostril like a flue!
543,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"A fop, a hanger-on of willing skirts--"
544,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,A murrain on him!  Would Elizabeth
545,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,In some mad freak had clapped him in the Tower--
546,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Ay, through the Traitor's Gate.  Would he were dead."
547,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Within the year what worthy men have died,"
548,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Persons of substance, civic ornaments,"
549,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And here 's this gilt court-butterfly on wing!
550,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"O thou most potent lightning in the cloud,"
551,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Prick me this fellow from the face of earth!
552,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,I would the Moors had got him in Algiers
553,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"What time he harried them on land and sea,"
554,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And done their will with scimitar or cord
555,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Or flame of fagot, and so made an end;"
556,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Or that some shot from petronel or bow
557,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Had winged him in the folly of his flight.
558,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Well had it been if the Inquisitors,"
559,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"With rack and screw, had laid black claw on him!"""
560,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,In days whose chronicle is writ in blood
561,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The richest ever flowed in English veins
562,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Some foul mischance in this sort might have been;
563,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,For at dark Fortune's feet had Darrell flung
564,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,In his youth's flower a daring gauntlet down.
565,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
566,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"A beardless stripling, at that solemn hour"
567,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"When, breaking its frail filaments of clay,"
568,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The mother's spirit soared invisible,"
569,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The younger son, unhoused as well he knew,"
570,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Had taken horse by night to London town,"
571,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,With right sore heart and nought else in his scrip
572,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,But boyish hope to footing find at Court--
573,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"A page's place, belike, with some great lord,"
574,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Or some small lord, that other proving shy"
575,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Of merit that had not yet clipt its shell.
576,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Day after day, in weather foul or fair,"
577,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"With lackeys, hucksters, and the commoner sort,"
578,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"At Whitehall and Westminster he stood guard,"
579,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Reading men's faces with most anxious eye.
580,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"There the lords swarmed, some waspish and some bland,"
581,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,But none would pause at plucking of the sleeve
582,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"To hearken to him, and the lad had died"
583,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,On London stones for lack of crust to gnaw
584,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"But that he caught the age's malady,"
585,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The something magical that was in air,"
586,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And made men poets, heroes, demi-gods--"
587,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Made Shakespeare, Rawleigh, Grenvile, Oxenham,"
588,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And set them stars in the fore-front of Time.
589,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"In fine, young Darrell drew of that same air"
590,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"A valiant breath, and shipped with Francis Drake,"
591,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Of Tavistock, to sail the Spanish seas"
592,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And teach the heathen manners, with God's aid;"
593,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And so, among lean Papists and black Moors,"
594,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"He, with the din of battle in his ears,"
595,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Struck fortune.  Who would tamely bide at home
596,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,At beck and call of some proud swollen lord
597,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Not worth his biscuit, or at Beauty's feet"
598,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Sit making sonnets, when was work to do"
599,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Out yonder, sinking Philip's caravels"
600,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"At sea, and then by way of episode"
601,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Setting quick torch* to pirate-nests ashore?

604,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"* Sir Francis Drake called this ""singeing the"
605,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"King of Spayne's beard."""
606,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
607,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
608,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Brave sport to singe the beard o' the King of Spain!
609,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Brave sport, but in the end dreamed he of home--"
610,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Of where the trout-brook lisped among the reeds,"
611,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Of great chalk cliffs and leagues of yellow gorse,"
612,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Of peaceful lanes, of London's roaring streets,"
613,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The crowds, the shops, the pageants in Cheapside,"
614,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And heard the trumpets blaring for the Queen
615,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,When 't was the wind that whistled in the shrouds
616,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Off Cadiz.  Ah, and softer dreams he had"
617,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Of an unnamed and sweetest mystery,"
618,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And from the marble of his soul's desire
619,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Hewed out the white ideal of his love--
620,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"A new Pygmalion!  All things drew him home,"
621,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"This mainly.  Foot on English earth once more,"
622,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Dear earth of England his propitious fame
623,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"A thorn in none but crooked Envy's side,"
624,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"He went cross-gartered, with a silken rose"
625,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"At golden lovelock, diamond brooch at hat"
626,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Looping one side up very gallantly,"
627,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And changed his doublet's color twice a day.
628,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Ill fare had given his softer senses edge;
629,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Good fortune, later, bade him come to dine,"
630,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Mild Spenser's scholar, Philip Sidney's friend."
631,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"So took he now his ease; in Devonshire,"
632,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"When Town was dull, or he had need at heart"
633,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,For sight of Wyndham Towers against the sky;
634,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"But chiefly did he bask him by the Thames,"
635,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,For there 't was that Young England froze and thawed
636,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,By turns in GLORIANA'S frown and smile.
637,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
638,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"As some wild animal that gets a wound,"
639,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And prescience hath of death, will drag itself"
640,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Back to its cavern sullenly to die,"
641,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And would not have heaven's airs for witnesses,"
642,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"So Wyndham, shrinking from the very stars"
643,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And tell-tale places where the moonlight fell,"
644,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Crept through the huddled shadows back to hall,"
645,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And in a lonely room where no light was,"
646,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Save what the moon made at the casement there,"
647,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Sat pondering his hurt, and in the dark"
648,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Gave audience to a host of grievances.
649,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"For never comes reflection, gay or grave,"
650,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,But it brings with it comrades of its hue.
651,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,So did he fall to thinking how his day
652,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Declined, and how his narrow life had run"
653,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Obscurely through an age of great events
654,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Such as men never saw, nor will again"
655,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Until the globe be riven by God's fire.
656,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Others had ventured for the Golden Fleece,"
657,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Knaves of no parts at all, and got renown,"
658,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"(By force of circumstance and not desert,)"
659,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,While he up there on that rock-bastioned coast
660,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Had rotted like some old hulk's skeleton,"
661,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Whose naked and bleached ribs the lazy tide
662,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Laps day by day, and no man thinks of more."
663,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Then was jade Fortune in her lavish mood.
664,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Why had he not for distant Colchis sailed
665,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And been the Jason of these Argonauts?
666,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"True, some had come to block on Tower Hill,"
667,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Or quittance made in a less noble sort;
668,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Still they had lived, from life's high-mantling cup"
669,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Had blown the bead.  In such case, if one's head"
670,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Be of its momentary laurel stripped
671,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And made a show of stuck on Temple Bar
672,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Or at the Southwark end of London Bridge,"
673,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,What mattered it?  At worst man dies but once--
674,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"So far as known.  One may not master death,"
675,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,But life should be one's lackey.  He had been
676,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Time's dupe and bondsman; ever since his birth
677,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Had walked this planet with his eye oblique,"
678,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Grasped what was worthless, what were most dear missed;"
679,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Missed love and fame, and all the sum of things"
680,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Fame gets a man in England--the Queen's smile,"
681,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Which means, when she 's in humor, abbey-lands,"
682,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Appointments, stars and ribbons for the breast,"
683,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And that sleek adulation that takes shape
684,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,I' the down-drooping of obsequious lids
685,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,When one ascends a stair or walks the pave.
686,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Good Lord! but it was excellent to see
687,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,How Expectation in the ante-room
688,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Crooks back to Greatness passing to the Queen--
689,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"""Kind sir!"" ""Sweet sir!"" ""I prithee speed my suit!"""
690,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"'T was somewhat to be flattered, though by fools,"
691,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,For even a fool's coin hath a kind of ring.
692,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Yet after all--thus did the grapes turn sour
693,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"To master Fox, in fable--who would care"
694,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"To moil and toil to gain a little fame,"
695,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And have each rascal that prowls under heaven
696,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Stab one for getting it?  Had he wished power,"
697,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The thing was in the market-place for sale
698,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,At stated rates--so much for a man's soul!
699,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"His was a haughty spirit that bent not,"
700,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And one to rise had need to cringe and creep.
701,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"So had his brother into favor crawled,"
702,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Like slug into the bosom of a rose,"
703,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And battened in the sun.  At thought of him,"
704,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Forgotten for a moment, Wyndham winced,"
705,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And felt his wound.  ""Why bides he not in Town"
706,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,With his blond lovelock and wench-luring ways--
707,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,There runs his fox!  What foul fiend sends him here
708,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,To Wyndham Towers?  Is there not space enough
709,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,In this our England he needs crowd me so?
710,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Has London sack upon his palate staled,"
711,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,That he must come to sip my Devon cream?
712,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Are all maids shut in nunneries save this one?
713,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,What magic philtre hath he given her
714,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,To thaw the ice that melted not for me?
715,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Rich is he now that at his setting forth
716,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Had not two silver pieces to his purse.
717,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,It is his brave apparel dazzles her.
718,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Thus puts he bound and barrier to my love.
719,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Another man were he abused as I...
720,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,I'll have no more of him!  If I but dared--
721,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Nay, I dare not.  I have fawn's blood, I think;"
722,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"I would, and dare not!""  Thrice the hooded clock"
723,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Solemnly, like some old Carthusian monk"
724,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"With meagre face half seen beneath his cowl,"
725,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Intoned the quarter.  Memory went not back
726,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"When this was not a most familiar sound,"
727,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Yet as each stroke on the dead silence fell
728,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Wyndham turned, startled.  Now the sanguine moon,"
729,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"To clouded opal changing momently,"
730,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Rose sheer above the pine-trees' ragged edge,"
731,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And through the wide-flung casement reaching hand
732,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,With cold and spectral finger touched the plates
733,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Of his dead father's armor till it gleamed
734,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"One mass of silver.  There it stood complete,"
735,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,That august panoply which once struck dread
736,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"To foemen on the sunny plains of France,"
737,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Menacing, terrible, this instant stood,"
738,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,With vizard down and jousting-lance at charge
739,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,As if that crumbled knight were quick within.
740,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
741,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,A footfall on the shingle walk below
742,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Grated, a footfall light as Mercury's"
743,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Disdaining earth, and Wyndham in the dark,"
744,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Half crouched upon the settle with his nails
745,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Indenting the soft wood-work, held his breath."
746,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Then suddenly a blind rage like a flame
747,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Swept over him and hurled him to his feet--
748,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Such rage as must have seized the soul of Cain
749,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Meeting his brother in the stubble-field.
750,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Anon came one that hummed a blithe sea-song,"
751,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"As he were fresh from tavern and brave cheer,"
752,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And held the stars that blinked there in the blue
753,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Boon comrades.  Singing in high-hearted way,"
754,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"His true-love's kiss a memory on his lip,"
755,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Straight on he came to unrenowned end
756,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Whose dream had been in good chain-mail to die
757,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"On some well-foughten field, at set of sun,"
758,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,With glorious peal of trumpets on his ear
759,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Proclaiming victory.  So had he dreamed.
760,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And there, within an arch at the stair-top"
761,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And screened behind a painted hanging-cloth
762,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Of coiled gold serpents ready to make spring,"
763,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Ignoble Death stood, his convulsive hand"
764,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Grasping a rapier part-way down the blade
765,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,To deal the blow with deadly-jewelled hilt--
766,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Black Death, turned white with horror of himself."
767,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Straight on came he that sang the blithe sea-song;
768,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And now his step was on the stair, and now"
769,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"He neared the blazoned hanging-cloth, and now..."
770,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
771,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The lights were out, and all life lay in trance"
772,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"On floor or pallet, blanketed to chin,"
773,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Each in his mask of sullen-seeming death--
774,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Fond souls that recked not what was in the air,"
775,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Else had the dead man's scabbard as it clashed
776,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Against the balustrade, then on the tiles,"
777,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Brought awkward witness.  One base hind there was
778,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Had stolen a venison-pasty on the shelf,"
779,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And now did penance; him the fall half roused
780,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"From dreadful nightmare; once he turned and gasped,"
781,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Then straightway snored again.  No other sound
782,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Within the dream-enchanted house was heard,"
783,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Save that the mastiff, lying at the gate"
784,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"With visionary bone, snarled in his sleep."
785,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Secret as bridal-kiss may murder be,"
786,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
787,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Done was the deed that could not be undone
788,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Throughout eternity.  O silent tongue
789,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,That would blab all with silence!  What to do?
790,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,How hide this speechless witness from men's gaze?
791,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Living, that body vexed us; being dead"
792,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,'T is like to give us trouble and to spare.
793,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,O for a cavern in deep-bowelled earth!
794,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Quick, ere the dusky petals of the night"
795,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Unclosing bare the fiery heart of dawn
796,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And thus undo us with its garish light,"
797,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Let us this mute and pale accusing clay
798,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"In some undreamed-of sepulchre bestow,"
799,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"But where?  Hold back thy fleet-wing'd coursers, Time,"
800,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Whilst we bethink us!  Ah--such place there is!
801,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Close, too, at hand--a place wherein a man"
802,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Might lie till doomsday safer from the touch
803,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Of prying clown than is the spiced dust
804,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Of an Egyptian in his pyramid.
805,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
806,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"At a dark alcove's end of that long hall,"
807,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The ancient armor-room in the east wing,"
808,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,A certain door (whereof no mortal knew
809,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"save Wyndham, now that other lay a-cold)"
810,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Was to the panels of the wall so set,"
811,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And with such devilish shrewdness overlaid
812,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"By carvings of wild-flower and curled grape-leaf,"
813,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"That one not in the favor of the trick,"
814,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Albeit he knew such mechanism was,"
815,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Ere he put finger on the secret spring
816,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Had need of Job for ancestor, in faith!"
817,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"You pressed a rose, a least suspected rose,"
818,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And two doors turned on hinge, the inner door"
819,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Closing a space of say some six feet square,"
820,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Unlighted, sheathed with iron.  Doubtless here"
821,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The mediaeval Wyndhams hid their plate
822,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"When things looked wicked from the outer wall,"
823,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Or, on occasion, a grim ruthless lord"
824,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Immured some inconvenient two-faced friend--
825,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"To banquet bidden, and kept over night."
826,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Such pranks were played in Merrie England then.
827,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Sealed in the narrow compass of that cell,"
828,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Shut from God's light and his most precious air,"
829,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,A man might have of life a half-hour's lease
830,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,If he were hale and well-breathed at the start.
831,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
832,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Hither did Richard bear his brother's corse
833,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And fling it down.  Upon the stone-paved floor
834,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"In a thin strip of moonlight flung it down,"
835,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And then drew breath.  Perhaps he paused to glance
836,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"At the white face there, with the strange half-smile"
837,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Out-living death, the brightness of the hair"
838,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Lying in loops and tangles round the brow--
839,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"A seraph's face of silver set in gold,"
840,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Such as the deft Italians know to carve;
841,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Perhaps his tiger's blood cooled then, perhaps"
842,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Swift pity at his very heart-strings tugged,"
843,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And he in that black moment of remorse,"
844,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Seeing how there his nobler self lay slain,"
845,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Had bartered all this jewel-studded earth
846,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,To win life's color back to that wan cheek.
847,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Ah, let us hope it, and some mercy feel,"
848,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Since each at compt shall need of mercy have.
849,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Now how it happened, whether 't was the wind,"
850,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Or whether 't was some incorporeal hand
851,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"That reached down through the dark and did the thing,"
852,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Man knoweth not, but suddenly both doors,"
853,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Ere one could utter cry or put forth arm,"
854,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Closed with dull clang, and there in his own trap"
855,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Incontinent was red-stained Richard caught,"
856,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And as by flash of lightning saw his doom.
857,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Call, an thou wilt, but every ear is stuffed"
858,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"With slumber!  Shriek, and run quick frenzied hands"
859,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Along the iron sheathing of thy grave--
860,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"For 't is thy grave--no egress shalt thou find,"
861,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"No lock to break, no subtile-sliding bolt,"
862,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"No careless rivet, no half loosened plate"
863,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,For dagger's point to fret at and pry off
864,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And let a stifling mortal get to air!
865,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
866,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Angels of Light! what were a thousand years
867,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Of rankling envy and contemned love
868,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And all the bitter draughts a man may drink
869,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,To that half hour of Richard's with his Dead?
870,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
871,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Through silence, gloom, and star-strown paths of Night"
872,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The breathless hours like phantoms stole away.
873,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Black lay the earth, in primal blackness wrapt"
874,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Ere the great miracle once more was wrought.
875,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,A chill wind freshened in the pallid East
876,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And brought sea-smell of newly blossomed foam,"
877,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And stirred the leaves and branch-hung nests of birds.
878,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Fainter the glow-worm's lantern glimmered now
879,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"In the marsh land and on the forest's hem,"
880,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And the slow dawn with purple laced the sky
881,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Where sky and sea lay sharply edge to edge.
882,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The purple melted, changed to violet,"
883,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And that to every delicate sea-shell tinge,"
884,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Blush-pink, deep cinnabar; then no change was,"
885,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Save that the air had in it sense of wings,"
886,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Till suddenly the heavens were all aflame,"
887,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And it was morning.  O great miracle!
888,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"O radiance and splendor of the Throne,"
889,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Daily vouchsafed to us!  Yet saith the fool,"
890,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"""There is no God!""  And now a level gleam,"
891,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Thrust like a spear-head through the tangled boughs,"
892,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Smote Wyndham's turrets, and the spell was broke."
893,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
894,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And one by one, on pallet stretched or floor,"
895,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The sleepers wakened; each took up afresh
896,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"His load of life; but two there were woke not,"
897,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Nor knew 't was daybreak.  From the rusty nail
898,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The gateman snatched his bunch of ancient keys,"
899,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And, yawning, vowed the sun an hour too soon;"
900,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The scullion, with face shining like his pans,"
901,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Hose down at heel and jerkin half unlaced,"
902,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,On hearthstone knelt to coax the smouldering log;
903,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The keeper fetched the yelping hounds their meat;
904,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The hostler whistled in the stalls; anon,"
905,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"With rustling skirt and slumber-freshened cheek,"
906,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The kerchief'd housemaid tripped from room to room
907,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"(Sweet Gillian, she that broke the groom his heart),"
908,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"While, wroth within, behind a high-backed chair"
909,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The withered butler for his master waited,"
910,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Cursing the cook.  That day the brewis spoiled.
911,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
912,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,That day came neither kinsman to break bread.
913,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"When it was seen that both had lain abroad,"
914,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The wolf-skins of their couches made that plain
915,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"As pike-staff, or the mole on Gillian's cheek,"
916,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The servants stared.  Some journey called them hence;
917,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,At dead of night some messenger had come
918,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Of secret import, may be from the Queen,"
919,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And they paused not for change of raiment even.
920,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And yet, in faith, that were but little like;"
921,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Sir Richard had scant dealings with the Court.
922,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Still--if Northumberland were in arms again.
923,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,'T was passing strange.  No beast had gone from rack.
924,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"How had they gone, then?  Who looked on them last?"
925,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Up rose the withered butler, he it was:"
926,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"They supped together, of no journey spoke,"
927,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Spoke little, 't was their custom; after meal"
928,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The master's brother sallied forth alone,"
929,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The master stayed within.  ""That did he not,"""
930,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Quoth one, ""I saw Sir Richard in the close"
931,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"I' the moonrise.""  ""'T was eleven on the stroke,"""
932,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Said Gillian softly, ""he, or 't was his ghost--"
933,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Methought his face was whiter than my smock--
934,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Passed through the courtyard, and so into house."
935,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Yet slept he not there!""  And that other one,"
936,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The guest unwelcome, kinsman little loved"
937,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,(How these shrewd varlets turn us inside out
938,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"At kitchen-conclaves, over our own wine!)"
939,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Him had no eye seen since he issued forth
940,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"As curfew sounded. ""Call me lying knave""--"
941,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,He of the venison-pasty had the word--
942,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"""And let me nevermore dip beak in ale"
943,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Or sit at trencher with good smoking meat,"
944,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"If I heard not, in middle of the night,"
945,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The cock crow thrice, and took it for a sign."""
946,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"""So, marry, 't was--that thou wert drunk again."""
947,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"But no one laughed save he that made the jest,"
948,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Which often happens.  The long hours wore on,"
949,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And gloaming fell.  Then came another day,"
950,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And then another, until seven dawns"
951,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,In Time's slow crucible ran ruddy gold
952,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And overflowed the gray horizon's edge;
953,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And yet no hosts at table--an ill thing!
954,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And now 't was on the eve of Michaelmas.
955,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
956,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,What could it mean?  From out their lethargy
957,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"At last awaking, searchers in hot haste,"
958,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Some in the saddle, some afoot with hounds,"
959,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Scoured moor and woodland, dragged the neighboring weirs"
960,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And salmon-streams, and watched the wily hawk"
961,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Slip from his azure ambush overhead,"
962,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,With ever a keen eye for carrion:
963,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"But no man found, nor aught that once was man."
964,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,By land they went not; went they water-ways?
965,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Might be, from Bideford or Ilfracombe."
966,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Mayhap they were in London, who could tell?"
967,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,God help us! do men melt into the air?
968,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Yet one there was whose dumb unlanguaged love
969,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Had all revealed, had they but given heed."
970,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Across the threshold of the armor-room
971,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The savage mastiff stretched himself, and starved."
972,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
973,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Now where lags he, upon what alehouse bench"
974,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"'Twixt here and London, who shall lift this weight?"
975,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Were he not slain upon the Queen's highway
976,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Ere he reached Town, or tumbled into ford"
977,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"With too much sack-and-sugar under belt,"
978,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Then was his face set homeward this same hour,"
979,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Why lingers he?  Ill news, 't is said, flies fast,"
980,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And good news creeps; then his must needs be good
981,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,That lets the tortoise pass him on the road.
982,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Ride, Dawkins, ride! by flashing tarn and fen"
983,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And haunted hollow!  Look not where in chains
984,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"On Hounslow heath the malefactor hangs,"
985,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"A lasting terror!  Give thy roan jade spur,"
986,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And spare her not!  All Devon waits for thee,"
987,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Thou, for the moment, most important man!"
988,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"A sevennight later, when the rider sent"
989,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,To Town drew rein before The Falcon inn
990,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Under the creaking of the windy sign,"
991,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And slipped from saddle with most valorous call
992,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"For beer to wash his throat out, then confessed"
993,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"He brought no scrap of any honest news,"
994,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The last hope died, and so the quest was done."
995,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"""They far'd afoot,"" quoth one, ""but where God wot."""
996,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
997,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The blackthorn bloomed anew, and the long grass"
998,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Was starred with flowers that once Griselda prized,"
999,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"But plucked not.  She, poor wench, from moon to moon"
1000,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Waxed pale and paler: of no known disease,"
1001,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The village-leech averred, with lips pursed out"
1002,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And cane at chin; some inward fire, he thought,"
1003,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Consumed.  A dark inexplicable blight
1004,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Had touched her, thinned her, till of that sweet earth"
1005,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Scarce more was left than would have served to grow
1006,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"A lily.  Later, at a fresh-turned grave,"
1007,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"From out the maiden strewments, as it were,"
1008,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"A whisper rose, of most pathetic breath,"
1009,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Of how one maid had been by two men loved--
1010,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"No names, God's mercy!--and that neither man"
1011,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Would wed her: why?--conjecture faltered there,"
1012,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"For whiter was she than new-drifted snow,"
1013,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Or bleached lamb's wool, or any purest thing,"
1014,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Such stuff in sooth as Heaven shapes angels of;
1015,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And how from their warm, comfortable beds"
1016,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"These two men wandered out into the night,"
1017,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Sore stricken and distempered in their mind,"
1018,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And being by Satan blinded and urged on
1019,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Did fling them headlong from a certain crag
1020,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,That up Clovelly way o'erhangs the sea--
1021,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,O'erhangs the sea to tempt unhappy folk.
1022,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"From door to door the piteous legend passed,"
1023,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And like a thrifty beggar took from each.
1024,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And when the long autumnal season came
1025,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"To that bleak, bitter coast, and when at night"
1026,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The deep was shaken, and the pent cloud broke"
1027,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Crashing among the lurid hills of heaven,"
1028,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And in brief sudden swoonings of the gale
1029,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Contentious voices rose from the sand-dunes,"
1030,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Then to low sobs and murmurs died away,"
1031,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The fishwives, with their lean and sallow cheeks"
1032,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Lit by the flickering driftwood's ruddy glow,"
1033,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Drew closer to the crane, and under breath"
1034,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,To awestruck maidens told the fearful tale.
1035,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
1036,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The red leaf withered and the green leaf grew.
1037,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,'T was said that once the Queen reached out her hand--
1038,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,This was at Richmond in her palace there--
1039,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And let it rest on Burleigh's velvet sleeve,"
1040,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And spoke--right stately was she in her rouge:
1041,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"""Prithee, good Master Cecil, tell us now"
1042,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Was 't ever known what ill befell those men,"
1043,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Those Wyndhams?  Were they never, never found?"
1044,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Look you, 't will be three years come Michaelmas:"
1045,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,'T were well to have at least the bones of them.
1046,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"'Fore God, sir! this is something should be seen!"
1047,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"When the Armada, which God smote and sunk,"
1048,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Threatened our Realm, our buckler and our shield"
1049,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Were such stout hearts as that young Wyndham was.
1050,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The elder brother--well, Heaven fashioned him."
1051,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Our subjects are our subjects, mark you that."
1052,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Not found, forsooth!  Why, then, they should be found!"""
1053,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Fain had my good Lord Burleigh solved the thing,"
1054,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And smoothed that ominous wrinkle on the brow
1055,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Of her Most Sweet Imperious Majesty.
1056,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Full many a problem his statecraft had solved--
1057,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"How strangle treason, how soothe turbulent peers,"
1058,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"How foil the Pope and Spain, how pay the Fleet--"
1059,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Mere temporal matters; but this business smelt
1060,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Strongly of brimstone.  Bring back vanished folk!
1061,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,That could not Master Cecil an he would.
1062,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
1063,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The red leaf withered and the green leaf grew.
1064,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Dark were the days that came to Wyndham Towers
1065,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,With that grim secret rusting in its heart.
1066,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,On the sea's side along the fissured wall
1067,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The lichen spread in patches of dull gold
1068,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Up to the battlements, at times assailed"
1069,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"By sheeted ghosts of mist blown from the sea,"
1070,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Now by the whistling arrows of the sleet
1071,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Pelted, and thrice of lightning scorched and seamed,"
1072,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,But stoutly held from dreary year to year
1073,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"By legions of most venerable rooks,"
1074,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Shrill black-robed prelates of the fighting sort.
1075,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"In the wide moat, run dry with summer droughts"
1076,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Great scarlet poppies lay in drifts and heaps,"
1077,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Like bodies fall'n there in some vain assault.
1078,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Within, decay and dolor had their court--"
1079,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Dolor, decay, and silence, lords of all."
1080,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,From room to room the wind went shuddering
1081,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,On some vague endless quest; now pausing here
1082,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"To lift an arras, and then hurrying on,"
1083,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"To some fresh clue, belike!  The sharp-nosed mouse"
1084,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Through joist and floor discreetly gnawed her way,"
1085,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And for her glossy young a lodging made
1086,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,In a cracked corselet that once held a heart.
1087,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The meditative spider undisturbed
1088,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Wove his gray tapestry from sill to sill.
1089,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Over the transom the stone eagle drooped,"
1090,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"With one wing gone, in most dejected state"
1091,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Moulting his feathers.  A blue poisonous vine,"
1092,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Whose lucent berry, hard as Indian jade,"
1093,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"No squirrel tried his tooth on, June by June"
1094,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,On the south hill-slope festered in the sun.
1095,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Man's foot came not there.  It was haunted ground.
1096,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
1097,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The red leaf withered and the green leaf grew.
1098,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"An oak stood where an acorn tumbled once,"
1099,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Ages ago, and all the world was strange."
1100,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Now, in that year King Charles the Second left"
1101,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Forever the soft arms of Mistress Gwynn
1102,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And wrapt him in that marble where he lies,"
1103,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The moulder'd pile with its entombed Crime
1104,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Passed to the keep of a brave new-fledged lord,"
1105,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Who, liking much the sane and wholesome air"
1106,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"That bent the boughs and fanned the turret's top,"
1107,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Cried, ""Here dwell I!""  So fell it on a day"
1108,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The stroke of mallets and the screech of saws
1109,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,In those bleak chambers made such din as stopped
1110,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The careful spider half-way up his thread,"
1111,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And panic sent to myriad furtive things
1112,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,That dwelt in wainscots and loved not the sun.
1113,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Vainly in broken phalanx clamorous
1114,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Did the scared rooks protest, and all in vain"
1115,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,The moths on indolent white damask wings
1116,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,At door and casement rallied.   Wyndham Towers
1117,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Should have a bride, and ghosts had word to quit."
1118,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
1119,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And now, behold what strange thing came to pass."
1120,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"A certain workman, in the eastern wing"
1121,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Plying his craft alone as the day waned--
1122,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"One Gregory Nokes, a very honest soul,"
1123,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,By trade wood-carver--stumbled on a door
1124,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Leading to nowhere at an alcove's end,"
1125,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,A double door that of itself swung back
1126,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,In such strange way as no man ever saw;
1127,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And there, within a closet, on the flags"
1128,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Were two grim shapes which, vaguely seen at first"
1129,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"In the half light, grew presently distinct--"
1130,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Two gnomes or vampires seemed they, or dire imps"
1131,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Straight from the Pit, in guise fantastical"
1132,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Of hose and doublet: one stretched out full length
1133,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Supine, and one in terror-stricken sort"
1134,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Half toppled forward on the bended knee,"
1135,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Grasping with vise-like grip the other's wrist,"
1136,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"As who should say, Arouse thee, sleep no more!"
1137,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"But said it not.  If they were quick or dead,"
1138,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,No sign they gave beyond this sad dumb show.
1139,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Blurred one face was, yet luminous, like the moon"
1140,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Caught in the fleecy network of a cloud,"
1141,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Or seen glassed on the surface of a tarn
1142,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,When the wind crinkles it and makes all dim;
1143,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The other, drawn and wrenched by mortal throes,"
1144,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And in the aspect such beseeching look
1145,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,As might befall some poor wretch called to compt
1146,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"On the sudden, even as he kneels at prayer,"
1147,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,With Mercy! turned to frost upon the lip.
1148,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
1149,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Thus much saw Nokes within the closet there
1150,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Ere he drew breath; then backing step by step,"
1151,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The chisel clutched in still uplifted hand,"
1152,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"His eyes still fixed upon the ghosts, he reached"
1153,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,An open window giving on the court
1154,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Where the stone-cutters were; to them he called
1155,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Softly, in whispers under his curved palm,"
1156,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Lest peradventure a loud word should rouse
1157,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The phantoms; but ere foot could climb the stair,"
1158,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Or the heart's pulses count the sum of ten,"
1159,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Through both dread shapes, as at God's finger-touch,"
1160,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"A shiver ran, the wavering outlines broke,"
1161,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And suddenly a chill and mist-like breath
1162,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Touched Nokes's cheek as he at casement leaned,"
1163,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And nought was left of that most piteous pair
1164,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Save two long rapiers of some foreign make
1165,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Lying there crossed, a mass of flaky rust."
1166,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
1167,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"O luckless carver of dead images,"
1168,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Saint's-head or gargoyle, thou hast seen a sight"
1169,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Shall last thee to the confines of the grave!
1170,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Ill were thy stars or ever thou wert born
1171,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,That thou shouldst look upon a thing forbid!
1172,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Now in thine eye shall it forever live,"
1173,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And the waste solitudes of night inhabit
1174,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"With direful shadows of the nether world,"
1175,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Yet leave thee lonely in the throng of men--
1176,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Not of them, thou, but creature set apart"
1177,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Under a ban, and doomed henceforth to know"
1178,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"The wise man's scorn, the dull man's sorry jest."
1179,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,For who could credence give to that mad tale
1180,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Of churchyard folk appearing in broad day,"
1181,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And drifting out at casement like a mist?
1182,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Marry, not they who crowded up the stair"
1183,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"In haste, and peered into that empty cell,"
1184,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"And had half mind to buffet Master Nokes,"
1185,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Standing with finger laid across his palm
1186,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"In argumentative, appealing way,"
1187,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Distraught, of countenance most woe-begone."
1188,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"""See!--the two swords.  As I 'm a Christian soul!"""
1189,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"""Odds, man!"" cried one, ""thou 'st been a-dreamin', man."
1190,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"Cleave to thy beer, an' let strong drink alone!"""
1191,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
1192,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,So runs the legend.  So from their long sleep
1193,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Those ghosts arose and fled into the night.
1194,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"But never bride came to that dark abode,"
1195,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,"For wild flames swept it ere a month was gone,"
1196,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,And nothing spared but that forlorn old tower
1197,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Whereon the invisible fingers of the wind
1198,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,Its fitful and mysterious dirges play.
1199,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
1200,WYNDHAM TOWERS.,
