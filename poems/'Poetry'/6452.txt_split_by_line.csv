38,RIGHT ROYAL,
39,RIGHT ROYAL,An hour before the race they talked together
40,RIGHT ROYAL,"A pair of lovers in the mild March weather,"
41,RIGHT ROYAL,"Charles Cothill and the golden lady, Em."
42,RIGHT ROYAL,
43,RIGHT ROYAL,Beautiful England's hands had fashioned them.
44,RIGHT ROYAL,
45,RIGHT ROYAL,"He was from Sleins, that manor up the Lithe;"
46,RIGHT ROYAL,Riding the Downs had made his body blithe;
47,RIGHT ROYAL,"Stalwart he was, and springy, hardened, swift,"
48,RIGHT ROYAL,"Able for perfect speed with perfect thrift,"
49,RIGHT ROYAL,Man to the core yet moving like a lad.
50,RIGHT ROYAL,"Dark honest eyes with merry gaze he had,"
51,RIGHT ROYAL,"A fine firm mouth, and wind-tan on his skin."
52,RIGHT ROYAL,He was to ride and ready to begin.
53,RIGHT ROYAL,"He was to ride Right Royal, his own horse,"
54,RIGHT ROYAL,In the English Chaser's Cup on Compton Course.
55,RIGHT ROYAL,
56,RIGHT ROYAL,Under the pale coat reaching to his spurs
57,RIGHT ROYAL,"One saw his colours, which were also hers,"
58,RIGHT ROYAL,Narrow alternate bars of blue and white
59,RIGHT ROYAL,Blue as the speedwell's eye and silver bright.
60,RIGHT ROYAL,
61,RIGHT ROYAL,"What with hard work and waiting for the race,"
62,RIGHT ROYAL,Trouble and strain were marked upon his face;
63,RIGHT ROYAL,Men would have said that something worried him.
64,RIGHT ROYAL,
65,RIGHT ROYAL,"She was a golden lady, dainty, trim,"
66,RIGHT ROYAL,As like the love time as laburnum blossom.
67,RIGHT ROYAL,"Mirth, truth and goodness harboured in her bosom."
68,RIGHT ROYAL,
69,RIGHT ROYAL,Pure colour and pure contour and pure grace
70,RIGHT ROYAL,Made the sweet marvel of her singing face;
71,RIGHT ROYAL,She was the very may-time that comes in
72,RIGHT ROYAL,When hawthorns bud and nightingales begin.
73,RIGHT ROYAL,To see her tread the red-tippt daisies white
74,RIGHT ROYAL,"In the green fields all golden with delight,"
75,RIGHT ROYAL,"Was to believe Queen Venus come again,"
76,RIGHT ROYAL,She was as dear as sunshine after rain;
77,RIGHT ROYAL,Such loveliness this golden lady had.
78,RIGHT ROYAL,
79,RIGHT ROYAL,"All lovely things and pure things made her glad,"
80,RIGHT ROYAL,"But most she loved the things her lover loved,"
81,RIGHT ROYAL,"The windy Downlands where the kestrels roved,"
82,RIGHT ROYAL,The sea of grasses that the wind runs over
83,RIGHT ROYAL,Where blundering beetles drunken from the clover
84,RIGHT ROYAL,Stumble about the startled passer-by.
85,RIGHT ROYAL,There on the great grass underneath the sky
86,RIGHT ROYAL,"She loved to ride with him for hours on hours,"
87,RIGHT ROYAL,"Smelling the seasoned grass and those small flowers,"
88,RIGHT ROYAL,"Milkworts and thymes, that grow upon the Downs."
89,RIGHT ROYAL,There from a chalk edge they would see the towns:
90,RIGHT ROYAL,"Smoke above trees, by day, or spires of churches"
91,RIGHT ROYAL,Gleaming with swinging wind-cocks on their perches.
92,RIGHT ROYAL,"Or windows flashing in the light, or trains"
93,RIGHT ROYAL,Burrowing below white smoke across the plains.
94,RIGHT ROYAL,"By night, the darkness of the valley set"
95,RIGHT ROYAL,With scattered lights to where the ridges met
96,RIGHT ROYAL,"And three great glares making the heaven dun,"
97,RIGHT ROYAL,Oxford and Wallingford and Abingdon.
98,RIGHT ROYAL,
99,RIGHT ROYAL,"""Dear, in an hour,"" said Charles, ""the race begins."
100,RIGHT ROYAL,Before I start I must confess my sins.
101,RIGHT ROYAL,"For I have sinned, and now it troubles me."""
102,RIGHT ROYAL,
103,RIGHT ROYAL,"""I saw that you were sad,"" said Emily."
104,RIGHT ROYAL,
105,RIGHT ROYAL,"""Before I speak,"" said Charles, ""I must premise."
106,RIGHT ROYAL,"You were not here to help me to be wise,"
107,RIGHT ROYAL,"And something happened, difficult to tell."
108,RIGHT ROYAL,"Even if I sinned, I feel I acted well,"
109,RIGHT ROYAL,"From inspiration, mad as that may seem."
110,RIGHT ROYAL,Just at the grey of dawn I had a dream.
111,RIGHT ROYAL,
112,RIGHT ROYAL,It was the strangest dream I ever had.
113,RIGHT ROYAL,It was the dream that drove me to be mad.
114,RIGHT ROYAL,
115,RIGHT ROYAL,"I dreamed I stood upon the race-course here,"
116,RIGHT ROYAL,"Watching a blinding rainstorm blowing clear,"
117,RIGHT ROYAL,"And as it blew away I said aloud,"
118,RIGHT ROYAL,'That rain will make soft going on the ploughed.'
119,RIGHT ROYAL,"And instantly I saw the whole great course,"
120,RIGHT ROYAL,"The grass, the brooks, the fences toppt with gorse,"
121,RIGHT ROYAL,Gleam in the sun; and all the ploughland shone
122,RIGHT ROYAL,"Blue, like a marsh, though now the rain had gone."
123,RIGHT ROYAL,"And in my dream I said, 'That plough will be"
124,RIGHT ROYAL,"Terrible work for some, but not for me."
125,RIGHT ROYAL,Not for Right Royal.'
126,RIGHT ROYAL,"And a voice said, 'No"
127,RIGHT ROYAL,Not for Right Royal.'
128,RIGHT ROYAL,"And I looked, and lo"
129,RIGHT ROYAL,"There was Right Royal, speaking, at my side."
130,RIGHT ROYAL,"The horse's very self, and yet his hide"
131,RIGHT ROYAL,"Was like, what shall I say? like pearl on fire,"
132,RIGHT ROYAL,A white soft glow of burning that did twire
133,RIGHT ROYAL,Like soft white-heat with every breath he drew.
134,RIGHT ROYAL,"A glow, with utter brightness running through;"
135,RIGHT ROYAL,"Most splendid, though I cannot make you see."
136,RIGHT ROYAL,
137,RIGHT ROYAL,His great crest glittered as he looked at me
138,RIGHT ROYAL,Criniered with spitting sparks; he stamped the ground
139,RIGHT ROYAL,"All cock and fire, trembling like a hound,"
140,RIGHT ROYAL,"And glad of me, and eager to declare"
141,RIGHT ROYAL,His horse's mind.
142,RIGHT ROYAL,
143,RIGHT ROYAL,And I was made aware
144,RIGHT ROYAL,"That, being a horse, his mind could only say"
145,RIGHT ROYAL,"Few things to me. He said, 'It is my day,"
146,RIGHT ROYAL,"My day, to-day; I shall not have another.'"
147,RIGHT ROYAL,
148,RIGHT ROYAL,And as he spoke he seemed a younger brother
149,RIGHT ROYAL,"Most near, and yet a horse, and then he grinned"
150,RIGHT ROYAL,And tossed his crest and crinier to the wind
151,RIGHT ROYAL,And looked down to the Water with an eye
152,RIGHT ROYAL,All fire of soul to gallop dreadfully.
153,RIGHT ROYAL,
154,RIGHT ROYAL,"All this was strange, but then a stranger thing"
155,RIGHT ROYAL,Came afterwards. I woke all shivering
156,RIGHT ROYAL,"With wonder and excitement, yet with dread"
157,RIGHT ROYAL,"Lest the dream meant that Royal should be dead,"
158,RIGHT ROYAL,Lest he had died and come to tell me so.
159,RIGHT ROYAL,"I hurried out; no need to hurry, though;"
160,RIGHT ROYAL,There he was shining like a morning star.
161,RIGHT ROYAL,"Now hark. You know how cold his manners are,"
162,RIGHT ROYAL,Never a whinny for his dearest friend.
163,RIGHT ROYAL,"To-day he heard me at the courtyard end,"
164,RIGHT ROYAL,"He left his breakfast with a shattering call,"
165,RIGHT ROYAL,"A View Halloo, and, swinging in his stall,"
166,RIGHT ROYAL,Ran up to nuzzle me with signs of joy.
167,RIGHT ROYAL,It staggered Harding and the stable-boy.
168,RIGHT ROYAL,"And Harding said, 'What's come to him to-day?"
169,RIGHT ROYAL,He must have had a dream he beat the bay.'
170,RIGHT ROYAL,
171,RIGHT ROYAL,"Now that was strange; and, what was stranger, this."
172,RIGHT ROYAL,"I know he tried to say those words of his,"
173,RIGHT ROYAL,"'It is my day'; and Harding turned to me,"
174,RIGHT ROYAL,"'It is his day to-day, that's plain to see.'"
175,RIGHT ROYAL,Right Royal nuzzled at me as he spoke.
176,RIGHT ROYAL,That staggered me. I felt that I should choke.
177,RIGHT ROYAL,"It came so pat upon my unsaid thought,"
178,RIGHT ROYAL,I asked him what he meant.
179,RIGHT ROYAL,He answered 'Naught.
180,RIGHT ROYAL,It only came into my head to say.
181,RIGHT ROYAL,But there it is. To-day's Right Royal's day.'
182,RIGHT ROYAL,
183,RIGHT ROYAL,That was the dream. I cannot put the glory
184,RIGHT ROYAL,"With which it filled my being, in a story."
185,RIGHT ROYAL,No one can tell a dream.
186,RIGHT ROYAL,Now to confess.
187,RIGHT ROYAL,"The dream made daily life a nothingness,"
188,RIGHT ROYAL,"Merely a mould which white-hot beauty fills,"
189,RIGHT ROYAL,Pure from some source of passionate joys and skills.
190,RIGHT ROYAL,"And being flooded with my vision thus,"
191,RIGHT ROYAL,"Certain of winning, puffed and glorious,"
192,RIGHT ROYAL,"Walking upon this earth-top like a king,"
193,RIGHT ROYAL,"My judgment went. I did a foolish thing,"
194,RIGHT ROYAL,I backed myself to win with all I had.
195,RIGHT ROYAL,
196,RIGHT ROYAL,"Now that it's done I see that it was mad,"
197,RIGHT ROYAL,"But still, I had to do it, feeling so."
198,RIGHT ROYAL,"That is the full confession; now you know."""
199,RIGHT ROYAL,
200,SHE,SHE
201,SHE,"The thing is done, and being done, must be."
202,SHE,You cannot hedge. Would you had talked with me
203,SHE,"Before you plunged. But there, the thing is done."
204,SHE,
205,HE,HE
206,HE,Do not exaggerate the risks I run.
207,HE,"Right Royal was a bad horse in the past,"
208,HE,"A rogue, a cur, but he is cured at last;"
209,HE,"For I was right, his former owner wrong,"
210,HE,He is a game good chaser going strong.
211,HE,He and my lucky star may pull me through.
212,HE,
213,SHE,SHE
214,SHE,"O grant they may; but think what's racing you,"
215,SHE,Think for a moment what his chances are
216,SHE,"Against Sir Lopez, Soyland, Kubbadar."
217,SHE,
218,SHE,
219,HE,HE
220,HE,You said you thought Sir Lopez past his best.
221,HE,"I do, myself."
222,HE,
223,HE,
224,SHE,SHE
225,SHE,But there are all the rest.
226,SHE,"Peterkinooks, Red Ember, Counter Vair,"
227,SHE,And then Grey Glory and the Irish mare.
228,SHE,
229,HE,HE
230,HE,She's scratched. The rest are giving me a stone.
231,HE,Unless the field hides something quite unknown
232,HE,I stand a chance. The going favours me.
233,HE,"The ploughland will be bogland certainly,"
234,HE,"After this rain. If Royal keeps his nerve,"
235,HE,"If no one cannons me at jump or swerve,"
236,HE,"I stand a chance. And though I dread to fail,"
237,HE,This passionate dream that drives me like a sail
238,HE,"Runs in my blood, and cries, that I shall win."
239,HE,
240,SHE,SHE
241,SHE,
242,SHE,Please Heaven you may; but now (for me) begin
243,SHE,"Again the horrors that I cannot tell,"
244,SHE,"Horrors that made my childhood such a hell,"
245,SHE,Watching my Father near the gambler's grave
246,SHE,"Step after step, yet impotent to save."
247,SHE,
248,SHE,"You do not know, I never let you know,"
249,SHE,The horror of those days of long ago
250,SHE,When Father raced to ruin. Every night
251,SHE,After my Mother took away the light
252,SHE,"For weeks before each meeting, I would see"
253,SHE,Horrible horses looking down on me
254,SHE,"Laughing and saying ""We shall beat your Father."""
255,SHE,Then when the meetings came I used to gather
256,SHE,"Close up to Mother, and we used to pray."
257,SHE,"""O God, for Christ's sake, let him win to-day."""
258,SHE,
259,SHE,"And then we had to watch for his return,"
260,SHE,"Craning our necks to see if we could learn,"
261,SHE,"Before he entered, what the week had been."
262,SHE,
263,SHE,Now I shall look on such another scene
264,SHE,"Of waiting on the race-chance. For to-day,"
265,SHE,"Just as I did with Father, I shall say"
266,SHE,"""Yes, he'll be beaten by a head, or break"
267,SHE,"A stirrup leather at the wall, or take"
268,SHE,"The brook too slow, and, then, all will be lost."""
269,SHE,
270,SHE,"Daily, in mind, I saw the Winning Post,"
271,SHE,"The Straight, and all the horses' glimmering forms"
272,SHE,"Rushing between the railings' yelling swarms,"
273,SHE,"My Father's colours leading. Every day,"
274,SHE,"Closing my eyes, I saw them die away,"
275,SHE,"In the last strides, and lose, lose by a neck,"
276,SHE,"Lose by an inch, but lose, and bring the wreck"
277,SHE,A day's march nearer. Now begins again
278,SHE,The agony of waiting for the pain.
279,SHE,The agony of watching ruin come
280,SHE,Out of man's dreams to overwhelm a home.
281,SHE,
282,SHE,"Go now, my dear. Before the race is due,"
283,SHE,"We'll meet again, and then I'll speak with you."
284,SHE,
285,SHE,In a race-course box behind the Stand
286,SHE,Right Royal shone from a strapper's hand.
287,SHE,"A big dark bay with a restless tread,"
288,SHE,Fetlock deep in a wheat-straw bed;
289,SHE,"A noble horse of a nervy blood,"
290,SHE,By O Mon Roi out of Rectitude
291,SHE,Something quick in his eye and ear
292,SHE,Gave a hint that he might be queer.
293,SHE,"In front, he was all to a horseman's mind,"
294,SHE,Some thought him a trifle light behind.
295,SHE,"By two good points might his rank be known,"
296,SHE,A beautiful head and a Jumping Bone.
297,SHE,"He had been the hope of Sir Button Budd,"
298,SHE,"Who bred him there at the Fletchings stud,"
299,SHE,But the Fletchings jockey had flogged him cold
300,SHE,In a narrow thing as a two-year-old.
301,SHE,"After that, with his sulks and swerves,"
302,SHE,"Dread of the crowd and fits of nerves,"
303,SHE,Like a wastrel bee who makes no honey
304,SHE,He had hardly earned his entry money.
305,SHE,
306,SHE,"Liking him still, though he failed at racing,"
307,SHE,Sir Button trained him for steeple-chasing.
308,SHE,"He jumped like a stag, but his heart was cowed;"
309,SHE,Nothing would make him face the crowd;
310,SHE,When he reached the Straight where the crowds began
311,SHE,He would make no effort for any man.
312,SHE,
313,SHE,"Sir Button sold him, Charles Cothill bought him,"
314,SHE,Rode him to hounds and soothed and taught him.
315,SHE,After two years' care Charles felt assured
316,SHE,"That his horse's broken heart was cured,"
317,SHE,And the jangled nerves in tune again.
318,SHE,
319,SHE,"And now, as proud as a King of Spain,"
320,SHE,"He moved in his box with a restless tread,"
321,SHE,"His eyes like sparks in his lovely head,"
322,SHE,Ready to run between the roar
323,SHE,Of the stands that face the Straight once more;
324,SHE,"Ready to race, though blown, though beat,"
325,SHE,"As long as his will could lift his feet,"
326,SHE,Ready to burst his heart to pass
327,SHE,Each gasping horse in that street of grass.
328,SHE,"John Harding said to his stable-boy,"
329,SHE,
330,SHE,"""Would looks were deeds, for he looks a joy."
331,SHE,"He's come on well in the last ten days."""
332,SHE,"The horse looked up at the note of praise,"
333,SHE,"He fixed his eye upon Harding's eye,"
334,SHE,"Then he put all thought of Harding by,"
335,SHE,Then his ears went back and he clipped all clean
336,SHE,The manger's well where his oats had been.
337,SHE,
338,SHE,"John Harding walked to the stable-yard,"
339,SHE,His brow was worried with thinking hard.
340,SHE,"He thought, ""His sire was a Derby winner,"
341,SHE,"His legs are steel, and he loves his dinner,"
342,SHE,"And yet of old when they made him race,"
343,SHE,He sulked or funked like a real disgrace;
344,SHE,"Now for man or horse, I say, it's plain,"
345,SHE,"That what once he's been, he'll be again."
346,SHE,
347,SHE,"For all his looks, I'll take my oath"
348,SHE,"That horse is a cur, and slack as sloth."
349,SHE,
350,SHE,"He'll funk at a great big field like this,"
351,SHE,"And the lad won't cure that sloth of his,"
352,SHE,"He stands no chance, and yet Bungay says"
353,SHE,He's been backed all morning a hundred ways.
354,SHE,"He was twenty to one, last night, by Heaven:"
355,SHE,Twenty to one and now he's seven.
356,SHE,"Well, one of these fools whom fortune loves"
357,SHE,Has made up his mind to go for the gloves;
358,SHE,"But here's Dick Cappell to bring me news."""
359,SHE,
360,SHE,"Dick Cappell came from a London Mews,"
361,SHE,His fleshless face was a stretcht skin sheath
362,SHE,For the narrow pear of the skull beneath.
363,SHE,"He had cold blue eyes, and a mouth like a slit,"
364,SHE,With yellow teeth sticking out from it.
365,SHE,"There was no red blood in his lips or skin,"
366,SHE,"He'd a sinister, hard, sharp soul within."
367,SHE,"Perhaps, the thing that he most enjoyed"
368,SHE,Was being rude when he felt annoyed.
369,SHE,"He sucked his cane, he nodded to John,"
370,SHE,"He asked, ""What's brought your lambkin on?"""
371,SHE,
372,SHE,"John said, ""I had meant to ask of you,"
373,SHE,"Who's backing him, Dick, I hoped you knew."""
374,SHE,
375,SHE,"Dick said, ""Pill Stewart has placed the money."
376,SHE,"I don't know whose."""
377,SHE,"John said, ""That's funny."""
378,SHE,
379,SHE,"""Why funny?"" said Dick; but John said naught;"
380,SHE,He looked at the horse's legs and thought.
381,SHE,"Yet at last he said, ""It beats me clean,"
382,SHE,"But whoever he is, he must be green."
383,SHE,"There are eight in this could give him a stone,"
384,SHE,And twelve should beat him on form alone.
385,SHE,"The lad can ride, but it's more than riding"
386,SHE,"That will give the bay and the grey a hiding."""
387,SHE,
388,SHE,Dick sucked his cane and looked at the horse
389,SHE,"With ""Nothing's certain on Compton Course."
390,SHE,"He looks a peach. Have you tried him high?"""
391,SHE,
392,SHE,"John said, ""You know him as well as I;"
393,SHE,What he has done and what he can do.
394,SHE,He's been ridden to hounds this year or two.
395,SHE,"When last he was raced, he made the running,"
396,SHE,For a stable companion twice at Sunning.
397,SHE,"He was placed, bad third, in the Blowbury Cup"
398,SHE,And second at Tew with Kingston up.
399,SHE,"He sulked at Folkestone, he funked at Speen,"
400,SHE,"He baulked at the ditch at Hampton Green,"
401,SHE,"Nick Kingston thought him a slug and cur,"
402,SHE,'You must cut his heart out to make him stir.'
403,SHE,"But his legs are iron; he's fine and fit."""
404,SHE,
405,SHE,"Dick said, ""Maybe; but he's got no grit."
406,SHE,"With to-day's big field, on a course like this,"
407,SHE,He will come to grief with that funk of his.
408,SHE,"Well. It's queer, to me, that they've brought him on."
409,SHE,"It's Kubbadar's race. Good morning, John."""
410,SHE,
411,SHE,"When Dick had gone from the stable-yard,"
412,SHE,John wrote a note on a racing card.
413,SHE,"He said, ""Since Stewart has placed the com.,"
414,SHE,It's Mr. Cothill he got it from.
415,SHE,Now why should that nice young man go blind
416,SHE,And back his horse? Has he lost his mind?
417,SHE,"Such a nice young fellow, so civil-spoken,"
418,SHE,"Should have more sense than to get him broken,"
419,SHE,For broken he'll be as sure as eggs
420,SHE,If he puts his money on horses' legs.
421,SHE,"And to trust to this, who's a nice old thing,"
422,SHE,But can no more win than a cow can sing.
423,SHE,
424,SHE,"Well, they say that wisdom is dearly bought,"
425,SHE,A world of pain for a want of thought;
426,SHE,"But why should he back what stands no chance,"
427,SHE,No more than the Rowley Mile's in France?
428,SHE,Why didn't he talk of it first with me?
429,SHE,
430,SHE,"Well, Lord, we trainers can let it be,"
431,SHE,Why can't these owners abstain the same?
432,SHE,It can't be aught but a losing game.
433,SHE,He'll finish ninth; he'll be forced to sell
434,SHE,"His horse, his stud, and his home as well;"
435,SHE,"He'll lose his lady, and all for this"
436,SHE,A daft belief in that horse of his.
437,SHE,
438,SHE,"It's nothing to me, a man might say,"
439,SHE,"That a rich young fool should be cast away,"
440,SHE,"Though what he does with his own, in fine,"
441,SHE,Is certainly no concern of mine.
442,SHE,"I'm paid to see that his horse is fit,"
443,SHE,I can't engage for an owner's wit.
444,SHE,"For the heart of a man may love his brother,"
445,SHE,But who can be wise to save another?
446,SHE,"Souls are our own to save from burning,"
447,SHE,"We must all learn how, and pay for learning."
448,SHE,
449,SHE,"And now, by the clock, that bell that went"
450,SHE,Was the Saddling Bell for the first event.
451,SHE,
452,SHE,"Since the time comes close, it will save some swearing"
453,SHE,"If we get beforehand, and start preparing."""
454,SHE,
455,SHE,"The roads were filled with a drifting crowd,"
456,SHE,"Many mouth-organs droned aloud,"
457,SHE,"A couple of lads in scarlet hats,"
458,SHE,"Yellow trousers and purple spats,"
459,SHE,"Dragged their banjos, wearily eyeing"
460,SHE,Passing brakes full of sportsmen Hi-ing.
461,SHE,
462,SHE,Then with a long horn blowing a glory
463,SHE,"Came the four-in-hand of the young Lord Tory,"
464,SHE,The young Lord's eyes on his leader's ears
465,SHE,And the blood-like team going by to cheers.
466,SHE,Then in a brake came cheerers and hooters
467,SHE,Peppering folk from tin peashooters;
468,SHE,The Green Man's Friendly in bright mauve caps
469,SHE,"Followed fast in the Green Man's traps,"
470,SHE,The crowd made way for the traps to pass
471,SHE,"Then a drum beat up with a blare of brass,"
472,SHE,Medical students smart as paint
473,SHE,Sang gay songs of a sad complaint.
474,SHE,
475,SHE,A wolf-eyed man who carried a kipe
476,SHE,"Whistled as shrill as a man could pipe,"
477,SHE,Then paused and grinned with his gaps of teeth
478,SHE,"Crying ""Here's your colours for Compton Heath,"
479,SHE,"All the colours of all the starters,"
480,SHE,For gentlemen's ties and ladies' garters;
481,SHE,"Here you have them, penny a pin,"
482,SHE,Buy your colours and see them win.
483,SHE,"Here you have them, the favourites' own,"
484,SHE,"Sir Lopez' colours, the blue-white-roan,"
485,SHE,For all the races and what'll win 'em
486,SHE,"Real jockey's silk with a pin to pin 'em."""
487,SHE,
488,SHE,Out of his kipe he sold to many
489,SHE,Bright silk buttons and charged a penny.
490,SHE,
491,SHE,"A bookie walked with his clerk beside him,"
492,SHE,"His stool on his shoulders seemed to ride him,"
493,SHE,His white top-hat bore a sign which ran
494,SHE,"""Your old pal Bunkie the working man."""
495,SHE,"His clothes were a check of three-inch squares,"
496,SHE,"""Bright brown and fawn with the pearls in pairs,"""
497,SHE,"Double pearl buttons ran down the side,"
498,SHE,"The knees were tight and the ankles wide,"
499,SHE,"A bright, thick chain made of discs of tin"
500,SHE,Secured a board from his waist to chin.
501,SHE,
502,SHE,The men in the brakes that passed at trot
503,SHE,"Read ""First past Post"" and ""Run or Not."""
504,SHE,"The bookie's face was an angry red,"
505,SHE,His eyes seemed rolling inside his head.
506,SHE,"His clerk was a lean man, secret, spare,"
507,SHE,With thin lips knowing and damp black hair.
508,SHE,A big black bag much weathered with rain
509,SHE,Hung round his neck by a leathered chain.
510,SHE,
511,SHE,Seven linked dancers singing a song
512,SHE,"Bowed and kicked as they danced along,"
513,SHE,The middleman thrust and pulled and squeezed
514,SHE,A concertina to tunes that pleased.
515,SHE,"After them, honking, with Hey, Hey, Hey,"
516,SHE,"Came drivers thrusting to clear the way,"
517,SHE,"Drivers vexed by the concertina,"
518,SHE,"Saying ""Go bury that d----d hyena."""
519,SHE,Drivers dusty with wind-red faces
520,SHE,Leaning out of their driving-places.
521,SHE,The dancers mocked them and called them names:
522,SHE,"""Look at our butler,"" ""Drive on, James."""
523,SHE,"The cars drove past and the dust rose after,"
524,SHE,"Little boys chased them yelling with laughter,"
525,SHE,Clambering on them when they slowed
526,SHE,For a dirty ride down a perch of road.
527,SHE,A dark green car with a smart drab lining
528,SHE,Passed with a stately pair reclining;
529,SHE,Peering walkers standing aside
530,SHE,"Saw Soyland's owner pass with his bride,"
531,SHE,"Young Sir Eustace, biting his lip,"
532,SHE,"Pressing his chin with his finger-tip,"
533,SHE,"Nerves on edge, as he could not choose,"
534,SHE,From thought of the bets he stood to lose.
535,SHE,"His lady, a beauty whom thought made pale,"
536,SHE,Prayed from fear that the horse might fail.
537,SHE,A bright brass rod on the motor's bonnet
538,SHE,"Carried her husband's colours on it,"
539,SHE,Scarlet spots on a field of cream:
540,SHE,She stared ahead in a kind of dream.
541,SHE,
542,SHE,"Then came cabs from the railway stations,"
543,SHE,"Carrying men from all the nations,"
544,SHE,"Olive-skinned French with clipped moustaches,"
545,SHE,Almond-eyed like Paris apaches.
546,SHE,Rosy French with their faces shining
547,SHE,From joy of living and love of dining.
548,SHE,"Silent Spaniards, merry Italians,"
549,SHE,"Nobles, commoners, saints, rapscallions;"
550,SHE,Russians tense with the quest of truth
551,SHE,That maddens manhood and saddens youth;
552,SHE,"Learned Norwegians hale and limber,"
553,SHE,Brown from the barques new in with timber.
554,SHE,Oregon men of six feet seven
555,SHE,With backs from Atlas and hearts from Heaven.
556,SHE,"Orleans Creoles, ready for duels,"
557,SHE,"Their delicate ears with scarlet jewels,"
558,SHE,"Green silk handkerchiefs round their throats,"
559,SHE,In from sea with the cotton boats.
560,SHE,"Portuguese and Brazilianos,"
561,SHE,"Men from the mountains, men from the Llanos,"
562,SHE,"Men from the Pampas, men from the Sierras,"
563,SHE,"Men from the mines of the Cordilleras,"
564,SHE,Men from the flats of the tropic mud
565,SHE,Where the butterfly glints his mail with blood;
566,SHE,Men from the pass where day by day
567,SHE,The sun's heat scales the rocks away;
568,SHE,Men from the hills where night by night
569,SHE,The sheep-bells give the heart delight;
570,SHE,"Indians, Lascars and Bengalese."
571,SHE,"Greeks from the mainland, Greeks from the seas;"
572,SHE,"All kinds of bodies, all kinds of faces,"
573,SHE,"All were coming to see the races,"
574,SHE,Coming to see Sir Lopez run
575,SHE,And watch the English having their fun.
576,SHE,
577,SHE,The Carib boxer from Hispaniola
578,SHE,Wore a rose in his tilted bowler;
579,SHE,"He drove a car with a yellow panel,"
580,SHE,He went full speed and he drove a channel.
581,SHE,
582,SHE,Then came dog-carts and traps and wagons
583,SHE,"With hampers of lunches, pies and flagons,"
584,SHE,Bucks from city and flash young bloods
585,SHE,"With vests ""cut saucy"" to show their studs,"
586,SHE,Hawbuck Towler and Spicey Random
587,SHE,Tooled in style in a rakish tandem.
588,SHE,Blood Dick Haggit and Bertie Askins
589,SHE,Had dancers' skirts on their horses' gaskins;
590,SHE,Crash Pete Snounce with that girl of Dowser's
591,SHE,Drove a horse that was wearing trousers;
592,SHE,The waggonette from The Old Pier Head
593,SHE,"Drove to the tune ""My Monkey's Dead."""
594,SHE,
595,SHE,The costermongers as smart as sparrows
596,SHE,Brought their wives in their donkey barrows.
597,SHE,"The clean-legged donkeys, clever and cunning,"
598,SHE,"Their ears cocked forward, their neat feet running,"
599,SHE,"Their carts and harness flapping with flags,"
600,SHE,Were bright as heralds and proud as stags.
601,SHE,And there in pride in the flapping banners
602,SHE,"Were the costers' selves in blue bandannas,"
603,SHE,"And the costers' wives in feathers curling,"
604,SHE,"And their sons, with their sweet mouth-organs skirling."
605,SHE,
606,SHE,And from midst of the road to the roadside shifting
607,SHE,"The crowd of the world on foot went drifting,"
608,SHE,Standing aside on the trodden grass
609,SHE,To chaff as they let the traffic pass.
610,SHE,"Then back they flooded, singing and cheering,"
611,SHE,"Plodding forward and disappearing,"
612,SHE,"Up to the course to take their places,"
613,SHE,To lunch and gamble and see the races.
614,SHE,
615,SHE,"The great grand stand, made grey by the weather,"
616,SHE,Flaunted colours that tugged their tether;
617,SHE,Tier upon tier the wooden seats
618,SHE,Were packed as full as the London streets
619,SHE,When the King and Queen go by in state.
620,SHE,
621,SHE,Click click clack went the turnstile gate;
622,SHE,"The orange-sellers cried ""Fat and fine"
623,SHE,"Seville oranges, sweet, like wine:"
624,SHE,"Twopence apiece, all juice, all juice."""
625,SHE,The pea and the thimble caught their goose.
626,SHE,
627,SHE,"Two white-faced lurchers, not over-clean,"
628,SHE,"Urged the passers to ""spot the Queen."""
629,SHE,"They flicked three cards that the world might choose,"
630,SHE,"They cried ""All prizes. You cannot lose."
631,SHE,"Come, pick the lady. Only a shilling."""
632,SHE,"One of their friends cried out, ""I'm willing."""
633,SHE,"He ""picked the lady"" and took his pay,"
634,SHE,"And he cried, ""It's giving money away."""
635,SHE,
636,SHE,"Men came yelling ""Cards of the races"";"
637,SHE,Men hawked matches and studs and laces;
638,SHE,Gipsy-women in green shawls dizened
639,SHE,Read girls' fortunes with eyes that glistened;
640,SHE,Negro minstrels on banjos strumming
641,SHE,Sang at the stiles to people coming.
642,SHE,
643,SHE,"Like glistening beetles clustered close,"
644,SHE,"The myriad motors parked in rows,"
645,SHE,"The bonnets flashed, and the brass did clink,"
646,SHE,As the drivers poured their motors drink.
647,SHE,
648,SHE,"The March wind blew the smell of the crowd,"
649,SHE,"All men there seemed crying aloud,"
650,SHE,But over the noise a louder roar
651,SHE,"Broke, as the wave that bursts on shore,"
652,SHE,"Drowns the roar of the wave that comes,"
653,SHE,"So this roar rose on the lesser hums,"
654,SHE,"""I back the field. I back the field."""
655,SHE,
656,SHE,"Man who lives under sentence sealed,"
657,SHE,"Tragical man, who has but breath"
658,SHE,"For few brief years as he goes to death,"
659,SHE,Tragical man by strange winds blown
660,SHE,"To live in crowds ere he die alone,"
661,SHE,"Came in his jovial thousands massing,"
662,SHE,To see Life moving and Beauty passing.
663,SHE,
664,SHE,They sucked their fruit in the wooden tiers
665,SHE,And flung the skins at the passers' ears;
666,SHE,"Drumming their heels on the planks below,"
667,SHE,They sang of Dolly of Idaho.
668,SHE,"Past, like a flash, the first race went."
669,SHE,The time drew by to the great event.
670,SHE,
671,SHE,At a quarter to three the big bell pealed;
672,SHE,The horses trooped to the Saddling Field.
673,SHE,"Covered in clothing, horse and mare"
674,SHE,Pricked their ears at the people there;
675,SHE,"Some showed devil, and some, composure,"
676,SHE,As they trod their way to the great enclosure.
677,SHE,
678,SHE,"When the clock struck three and the men weighed out,"
679,SHE,"Charles Cothill shook, though his heart was stout."
680,SHE,"The thought of his bets, so gaily laid,"
681,SHE,Seemed a stone the more when he sat and weighed.
682,SHE,
683,SHE,"As he swung in the scales and nursed his saddle,"
684,SHE,It seemed to him that his brains would addle;
685,SHE,"For now that the plunger reached the brink,"
686,SHE,The risk was more than he liked to think.
687,SHE,
688,SHE,"In ten more minutes his future life,"
689,SHE,"His hopes of home with his chosen wife,"
690,SHE,Would all depend on a doubtful horse
691,SHE,In a crowded field over Compton Course.
692,SHE,
693,SHE,He had backed Right Royal for all he owned.
694,SHE,At thought of his want of sense he groaned.
695,SHE,"""All for a dream of the night,"" he thought."
696,SHE,He was right for weight at eleven naught.
697,SHE,
698,SHE,"Then Em's sweet face rose up in his brain,"
699,SHE,He cursed his will that had dealt her pain:
700,SHE,To hurt sweet Emmy and lose her love
701,SHE,Was madman's folly by all above.
702,SHE,He saw too well as he crossed the yard
703,SHE,That his madman's plunge had borne her hard.
704,SHE,"""To wring sweet Em like her drunken father,"
705,SHE,
706,SHE,I'd fall at the Pitch and end it rather.
707,SHE,"Oh I hope, hope, hope, that her golden heart"
708,SHE,Will give me a word before I start.
709,SHE,"If I thought our love should have come to wreck,"
710,SHE,"I'd pull Right Royal and break my neck,"
711,SHE,And Monkery's shoe might kick my brains out
712,SHE,That my own heart's blood might wash my stains out.
713,SHE,
714,SHE,"But even if Emmy, my sweet, forgive,"
715,SHE,"I'm a ruined man, so I need not live,"
716,SHE,"For I've backed my horse with my all, by Heaven,"
717,SHE,"To be first in a field of thirty-seven,"
718,SHE,"And good as he is, the dream's a lie."""
719,SHE,
720,SHE,"He saw no hope, but to fall and die."
721,SHE,
722,SHE,As he left the room for the Saddling Paddock
723,SHE,He looked as white as the flesh of haddock.
724,SHE,"But Love, all seeing, though painted blind,"
725,SHE,Makes wisdom live in a woman's mind:
726,SHE,His love knew well from her own heart's bleeding
727,SHE,The word of help that her man was needing;
728,SHE,"And there she stood with her eyes most bright,"
729,SHE,Ready to cheer her heart's delight.
730,SHE,
731,SHE,"She said, ""My darling, I feel so proud"
732,SHE,To see you followed by all the crowd;
733,SHE,And I shall be proud as I see you win.
734,SHE,
735,SHE,"Right Royal, Soyland and Peterkin"
736,SHE,"Are the three I pick, first, second, third."
737,SHE,"And oh, now listen to what I heard."
738,SHE,Just now in the park Sir Norman Cooking
739,SHE,"Said, 'Harding, how well Right Royal's looking."
740,SHE,"They've brought him on in the ring, they say.'"
741,SHE,"John said, 'Sir Norman, to-day's his day.'"
742,SHE,"And Sir Norman said, 'If I had a monkey"
743,SHE,"I'd put it on yours, for he looks so spunky.'"
744,SHE,So you see that the experts think as you.
745,SHE,"Now, my own own own, may your dream come true,"
746,SHE,"As I know it will, as I know it must;"
747,SHE,You have all my prayer and my love and trust.
748,SHE,
749,SHE,"Oh, one thing more that Sir Norman said,"
750,SHE,'A lot of money has just been laid
751,SHE,On the mare Gavotte that no one knows.'
752,SHE,"He said 'She's small, but, my word, she goes."
753,SHE,"Since she bears no weight, if she only jumps,"
754,SHE,She'll put these cracks to their ace of trumps.
755,SHE,"But,' he said, 'she's slight for a course like this.'"
756,SHE,
757,SHE,"That's all my gossip, so there it is."
758,SHE,
759,SHE,"Dear, reckon the words I spoke unspoken,"
760,SHE,I failed in love and my heart is broken.
761,SHE,Now I go to my place to blush with pride
762,SHE,As the people talk of how well you ride;
763,SHE,I mean to shout like a bosun's mate
764,SHE,When I see you lead coming up the straight.
765,SHE,"Now may all God's help be with you, dear."""
766,SHE,
767,SHE,"""Well, bless you, Em, for your words of cheer."
768,SHE,And now is the woodcock near the gin.
769,SHE,Good-bye.
770,SHE,"Now, Harding, we'd best begin."""
771,SHE,
772,SHE,"At buckle and billet their fingers wrought,"
773,SHE,Till the sheets were home and the bowlines taut.
774,SHE,As he knotted the reins and took his stand
775,SHE,The horse's soul came into his hand
776,SHE,And up from the mouth that held the steel
777,SHE,"Came an innermost word, half thought, half feel,"
778,SHE,
779,SHE,"""My day to-day, O master, O master;"
780,SHE,"None shall jump cleaner, none shall go faster,"
781,SHE,"Call till you kill me, for I'll obey,"
782,SHE,"It's my day to-day, it's my day to-day."""
783,SHE,
784,SHE,"In a second more he had found his seat,"
785,SHE,"And the standers-by jumped clear of feet,"
786,SHE,For the big dark bay all fire and fettle
787,SHE,Had his blood in a dance to show his mettle.
788,SHE,Charles soothed him down till his tricks were gone;
789,SHE,Then he leaned for a final word from John.
790,SHE,
791,SHE,"John Harding's face was alert and grim,"
792,SHE,From under his hand he talked to him.
793,SHE,"""It's none of my business, sir,"" he said,"
794,SHE,"""What you stand to win or the bets you've made,"
795,SHE,But the rumour goes that you've backed your horse.
796,SHE,
797,SHE,Now you need no telling of Compton Course.
798,SHE,"It's a dangerous course at the best of times,"
799,SHE,But on days like this some jumps are crimes;
800,SHE,"With a field like this, nigh forty starting,"
801,SHE,After one time round it'll need re-charting.
802,SHE,
803,SHE,"Now think it a hunt, the first time round;"
804,SHE,"Don't think too much about losing ground,"
805,SHE,"Lie out of your ground, for sure as trumps"
806,SHE,There'll be people killed in the first three jumps.
807,SHE,"The second time round, pipe hands for boarding,"
808,SHE,You can see what's doing and act according.
809,SHE,
810,SHE,"Now your horse is a slug and a sulker too,"
811,SHE,Your way with the horse I leave to you;
812,SHE,"But, sir, you watch for these joker's tricks"
813,SHE,And watch that devil on number six;
814,SHE,"There's nothing he likes like playing it low,"
815,SHE,"What a horse mayn't like or a man mayn't know,"
816,SHE,And what they love when they race a toff
817,SHE,Is to flurry his horse at taking off.
818,SHE,The ways of the crook are hard to learn.
819,SHE,
820,SHE,Now watch that fence at the outer turn;
821,SHE,It looks so slight but it's highly like
822,SHE,That it's killed more men than the Dyers' Dyke.
823,SHE,"It's down in a dip and you turn to take it,"
824,SHE,"And men in a bunch, just there, mistake it."
825,SHE,"But well to the right, it's firmer ground,"
826,SHE,And the quick way there is the long way round.
827,SHE,"In Cannibal's year, in just this weather,"
828,SHE,There were five came down at that fence together.
829,SHE,"I called it murder, not riding races."
830,SHE,
831,SHE,"You've nothing to fear from the other places,"
832,SHE,Your horse can jump.
833,SHE,Now I'll say no more.
834,SHE,"They say you're on, as I said before."
835,SHE,"It's none of my business, sir, but still"
836,SHE,I would like to say that I hope you will.
837,SHE,"Sir, I wish you luck. When we two next meet"
838,SHE,"I hope to hear how you had them beat."""
839,SHE,
840,SHE,"Charles Cothill nodded with, ""Thank you, John."
841,SHE,"We'll try; and, oh, you're a thousand on."""
842,SHE,
843,SHE,"He heard John's thanks, but knew at a glance"
844,SHE,That John was sure that he stood no chance.
845,SHE,
846,SHE,"He turned Right Royal, he drew deep breath"
847,SHE,"With the thought ""Now for it; a ride to death."""
848,SHE,"""Now come, my beauty, for dear Em's sake,"
849,SHE,"And if come you can't, may our necks both break."""
850,SHE,
851,SHE,"And there to his front, with their riders stooping"
852,SHE,"For the final word, were the racers trooping."
853,SHE,
854,SHE,Out at the gate to cheers and banter
855,SHE,They paced in pride to begin their canter.
856,SHE,
857,SHE,"Muscatel with the big white star,"
858,SHE,"The roan Red Ember, and Kubbadar,"
859,SHE,
860,SHE,Kubbadar with his teeth bared yellow
861,SHE,"At the Dakkanese, his stable-fellow."
862,SHE,"Then Forward-Ho, then a chestnut weed,"
863,SHE,"Skysail, slight, with a turn of speed."
864,SHE,"The neat Gavotte under black and coral,"
865,SHE,"Then the Mutineer, Lord Leybourne's sorrel,"
866,SHE,"Natuna mincing, Syringa sidling,"
867,SHE,"Stormalong fighting to break his bridling,"
868,SHE,"Thunderbolt dancing with raw nerves quick,"
869,SHE,Trying a savage at Bitter Dick.
870,SHE,"The Ranger (winner three years before),"
871,SHE,"Now old, but ready for one try more;"
872,SHE,"Hadrian; Thankful; the stable-cronies,"
873,SHE,Peterkinooks and Dear Adonis;
874,SHE,"The flashing Rocket, with taking action;"
875,SHE,"Exception, backed by the Tencombe faction;"
876,SHE,"Old Sir Francis and young King Tony,"
877,SHE,Culverin striding from great hips bony.
878,SHE,
879,SHE,"At this, he rode through the open gate"
880,SHE,Into the course to try his fate.
881,SHE,
882,SHE,He heard a roar from a moving crowd;
883,SHE,Right Royal kindled and cried aloud.
884,SHE,"There was the course, stand, rail and pen,"
885,SHE,Peopled with seventy thousand men;
886,SHE,"Seventy thousand faces staring,"
887,SHE,"Carriages parked, a brass band blaring:"
888,SHE,Over the stand the flags in billows
889,SHE,Bent their poles like the wands of willows.
890,SHE,"All men there seemed trying to bawl,"
891,SHE,Yet a few great voices topped them all:
892,SHE,"""I back the field! I back the field!"""
893,SHE,
894,SHE,Right Royal trembled with pride and squealed.
895,SHE,
896,SHE,Charles Cothill smiled with relief to find
897,SHE,This roaring crowd to his horse's mind.
898,SHE,
899,SHE,"He passed the stand where his lady stood,"
900,SHE,His nerves were tense to the multitude;
901,SHE,His blood beat hard and his eyes grew dim
902,SHE,As he knew that some were cheering him.
903,SHE,"Then, as he turned, at his pace's end"
904,SHE,There came a roar as when floods descend.
905,SHE,All down the straight from the crowded stands
906,SHE,"Came the yells of voices and clap of hands,"
907,SHE,For with bright bay beauty that shone like flame
908,SHE,The favourite horse Sir Lopez came.
909,SHE,
910,SHE,His beautiful hips and splendid shoulders
911,SHE,"And power of stride moved all beholders,"
912,SHE,Moved non-bettors to try to bet
913,SHE,On that favourite horse not beaten yet.
914,SHE,With glory of power and speed he strode
915,SHE,To a sea of cheering that moved and flowed
916,SHE,And followed and heaped and burst like storm
917,SHE,From the joy of men in the perfect form;
918,SHE,Cheers followed his path both sides the course.
919,SHE,
920,SHE,Charles Cothill sighed when he saw that horse.
921,SHE,
922,SHE,"The cheering died, then a burst of clapping"
923,SHE,"Met Soyland's coming all bright from strapping,"
924,SHE,A big dark brown who was booted thick
925,SHE,Lest one of the jumps should make him click.
926,SHE,"He moved very big, he'd a head like a fiddle,"
927,SHE,"He seemed all ends without any middle,"
928,SHE,"But ill as he looked, that outcast racer"
929,SHE,Was a rare good horse and a perfect chaser.
930,SHE,"Then The Ghost came on, then Meringue, the bay,"
931,SHE,"Then proud Grey Glory, the dapple-grey;"
932,SHE,The splendid grey brought a burst of cheers.
933,SHE,"Then Cimmeroon, who had tried for years"
934,SHE,"And had thrice been placed and had once been fourth,"
935,SHE,Came trying again the proverb's worth.
936,SHE,
937,SHE,"Then again, like a wave as it runs a pier,"
938,SHE,"On and on, unbroken, there came a cheer"
939,SHE,"As Monkery, black as a collier-barge,"
940,SHE,"Trod sideways, bickering, taking charge."
941,SHE,"Cross-Molin, from the Blowbury, followed,"
942,SHE,"Lucky Shot skipped, Coranto wallowed,"
943,SHE,"Then Counter Vair, the declared-to-win,"
944,SHE,Stable-fellow of Cross-Molin;
945,SHE,"Culverin last, with Cannonade,"
946,SHE,Formed rearguard to the grand parade.
947,SHE,
948,SHE,"And now, as they turned to go to post,"
949,SHE,"The Skysail calfishly barged The Ghost,"
950,SHE,The Ghost lashed out with a bitter knock
951,SHE,"On the tender muscle of Skysail's hock,"
952,SHE,And Skysail's hope of that splendid hour
953,SHE,Was cut off short like a summer flower.
954,SHE,From the cantering crowd he limped apart
955,SHE,Back to the Paddock and did not start.
956,SHE,
957,SHE,"As they cantered down, Charles Cothill's mind"
958,SHE,Was filled with joy that his horse went kind;
959,SHE,"He showed no sulks, no sloth, no fear,"
960,SHE,But leant on his rein and pricked his ear.
961,SHE,"They lined themselves at the Post to start,"
962,SHE,Charles took his place with a thumping heart.
963,SHE,
964,SHE,"Excitement running in waves took hold,"
965,SHE,"His teeth were chattered, his hands were cold,"
966,SHE,His joy to be there was mixed with dread
967,SHE,To be left at post when they shot ahead.
968,SHE,"The horses sparred as though drunk with wine,"
969,SHE,They bickered and snatched at taking line.
970,SHE,
971,SHE,Then a grey-haired man with a hawklike face
972,SHE,Read from a list each rider's place.
973,SHE,"Sitting astride his pommely hack,"
974,SHE,He ordered them up or sent them back;
975,SHE,He bade them heed that they jump their nags
976,SHE,Over every jump between the flags.
977,SHE,
978,SHE,"Here Kubbadar, who was pulling double,"
979,SHE,"Went sideways, kicking and raising trouble,"
980,SHE,"Monkery seconded, kicking and biting,"
981,SHE,Thunderbolt followed by starting fighting.
982,SHE,
983,SHE,The starter eyed them and gave the order
984,SHE,"That the three wild horses keep the border,"
985,SHE,With men to hold them to keep them quiet.
986,SHE,Boys from the stables stopped their riot.
987,SHE,"Out of the line to the edge of the field,"
988,SHE,The three wild biters and kickers wheeled;
989,SHE,"Then the rest edged up and pawed and bickered,"
990,SHE,"Reached at their reins and snatched and snickered,"
991,SHE,Flung white foam as they stamped their hate
992,SHE,Of passionate blood compelled to wait.
993,SHE,
994,SHE,"Then the starter shouted to Charles, ""Good heaven,"
995,SHE,"This isn't a circus, you on Seven."""
996,SHE,For Royal squirmed like a box of tricks
997,SHE,"And Coranto's rider, the number Six,"
998,SHE,Cursed at Charles for a green young fool
999,SHE,Who ought to be at a riding school.
1000,SHE,
1001,SHE,"After a minute of swerves and shoving,"
1002,SHE,"A line like a half-moon started moving,"
1003,SHE,"Then Rocket and Soyland leaped to stride,"
1004,SHE,To be pulled up short and wheeled to side.
1005,SHE,
1006,SHE,"Then the trickier riders started thrusting,"
1007,SHE,Judging the starter's mind too trusting;
1008,SHE,"But the starter said, ""You know quite clearly"
1009,SHE,"That isn't allowed; though you'd like it dearly."""
1010,SHE,
1011,SHE,Then Cannonade made a sideways bolt
1012,SHE,That gave Exception an ugly jolt.
1013,SHE,"Then the line, reformed, broke all to pieces."
1014,SHE,
1015,SHE,"Then the line reforms, and the tumult ceases."
1016,SHE,Each man sits tense though his racer dances;
1017,SHE,"In a slow, jerked walk the line advances."
1018,SHE,
1019,SHE,"And then in a flash, more felt than seen,"
1020,SHE,"The flag shot down and the course showed green,"
1021,SHE,And the line surged forwards and all that glory
1022,SHE,Of speed was sweeping to make a story.
1023,SHE,
1024,SHE,"One second before, Charles Cothill's mind"
1025,SHE,"Had been filled with fear to be left behind,"
1026,SHE,"But now with a rush, as when hounds leave cover,"
1027,SHE,The line broke up and his fear was over.
1028,SHE,A glimmer of bay behind The Ghost
1029,SHE,Showed Dear Adonis still there at post.
1030,SHE,"Out to the left, a joy to his backer,"
1031,SHE,"Kubbadar led the field a cracker,"
1032,SHE,"The thunder of horses, all fit and foaming,"
1033,SHE,Made the blood not care whether death were coming.
1034,SHE,"A glimmer of silks, blue, white, green, red,"
1035,SHE,Flashed into his eye and went ahead;
1036,SHE,"Then hoof-casts scattered, then rushing horses"
1037,SHE,Passed at his side with all their forces.
1038,SHE,"His blood leapt up but his mind said ""No,"
1039,SHE,"Steady, my darling, slow, go slow."
1040,SHE,"In the first time round this ride's a hunt."""
1041,SHE,
1042,SHE,The Turk's Grave Fence made a line in front.
1043,SHE,
1044,SHE,"Long years before, when the race began,"
1045,SHE,That first of the jumps had maimed a man;
1046,SHE,"His horse, the Turk, had been killed and buried"
1047,SHE,There in the ditch by horse-hoofs herried;
1048,SHE,And over the poor Turk's bones at pace
1049,SHE,"Now, every year, there goes the race,"
1050,SHE,And many a man makes doctor's work
1051,SHE,"At the thorn-bound ditch that hides the Turk,"
1052,SHE,And every man as he rides that course
1053,SHE,"Thinks, there, of the Turk, that good old horse."
1054,SHE,
1055,SHE,"The thick thorn-fence stands five feet high,"
1056,SHE,"With a ditch beyond unseen by eye,"
1057,SHE,Which a horse must guess from his urgent rider
1058,SHE,Pressing him there to jump it wider.
1059,SHE,
1060,SHE,"And being so near both Stand and Post,"
1061,SHE,"Out of all the jumps men haunt it most,"
1062,SHE,"And there, with the crowd, and the undulled nerves,"
1063,SHE,"The old horse balks and the young horse swerves,"
1064,SHE,And the good horse falls with the bad on top
1065,SHE,And beautiful boldness comes to stop.
1066,SHE,
1067,SHE,"Charles saw the rush of the leading black,"
1068,SHE,And the forehands lift and the men sway back;
1069,SHE,"He steadied his horse, then with crash and crying"
1070,SHE,The top of the Turk's Grave Fence went flying.
1071,SHE,"Round in a flash, refusing danger,"
1072,SHE,Came the Lucky Shot right into Ranger;
1073,SHE,"Ranger swerving knocked Bitter Dick,"
1074,SHE,Who blundered at it and leaped too quick;
1075,SHE,"Then crash went blackthorn as Bitter Dick fell,"
1076,SHE,Meringue jumped on him and rolled as well.
1077,SHE,As Charles got over he splashed the dirt
1078,SHE,Of the poor Turk's grave on two men hurt.
1079,SHE,
1080,SHE,Right Royal landed. With cheers and laughter
1081,SHE,Some horses passed him and some came after;
1082,SHE,"A fine brown horse strode up beside him,"
1083,SHE,It was Thankful running with none to ride him;
1084,SHE,"Thankful's rider, dizzy and sick,"
1085,SHE,Lay in the mud by Bitter Dick.
1086,SHE,
1087,SHE,"In front, was the curving street of Course,"
1088,SHE,Barred black by the leaps unsmashed by horse.
1089,SHE,"A cloud blew by and the sun shone bright,"
1090,SHE,Showing the guard-rails gleaming white.
1091,SHE,"Little red flags, that gusts blew tense,"
1092,SHE,Streamed to the wind at each black fence.
1093,SHE,
1094,SHE,And smiting the turf to clods that scattered
1095,SHE,"Was the rush of the race, the thing that mattered,"
1096,SHE,"A tide of horses in fury flowing,"
1097,SHE,"Beauty of speed in glory going,"
1098,SHE,"Kubbadar pulling, romping first,"
1099,SHE,Like a big black fox that had made his burst.
1100,SHE,
1101,SHE,"And away and away and away they went,"
1102,SHE,A visible song of what life meant.
1103,SHE,"Living in houses, sleeping in bed,"
1104,SHE,"Going to business, all seemed dead,"
1105,SHE,Dead as death to that rush in strife
1106,SHE,Pulse for pulse with the heart of life.
1107,SHE,
1108,SHE,"""For to all,"" Charles thought, ""when the blood beats high"
1109,SHE,Comes the glimpse of that which may not die;
1110,SHE,"When the world is stilled, when the wanting dwindles,"
1111,SHE,"When the mind takes light and the spirit kindles,"
1112,SHE,"One stands on a peak of this old earth."""
1113,SHE,
1114,SHE,Charles eyed his horses and sang with mirth.
1115,SHE,What of this world that spins through space?
1116,SHE,"With red blood running lie rode a race,"
1117,SHE,"The beast's red spirit was one with his,"
1118,SHE,Emulous and in ecstasies;
1119,SHE,Joy that from heart to wild heart passes
1120,SHE,In the wild things going through the grasses;
1121,SHE,
1122,SHE,"In the hares in the corn, in shy gazelles"
1123,SHE,Running the sand where no man dwells;
1124,SHE,In horses scared at the prairie spring;
1125,SHE,"In the dun deer noiseless, hurrying;"
1126,SHE,"In fish in the dimness scarcely seen,"
1127,SHE,Save as shadows shooting in a shaking green;
1128,SHE,"In birds in the air, neck-straining, swift,"
1129,SHE,"Wing touching wing while no wings shift,"
1130,SHE,"Seen by none, but when stars appear"
1131,SHE,A reaper wandering home may hear
1132,SHE,"A sigh aloft where the stars are dim,"
1133,SHE,Then a great rush going over him:
1134,SHE,This was his; it had linked him close
1135,SHE,"To the force by which the comet goes,"
1136,SHE,"With the rein none sees, with the lash none feels,"
1137,SHE,But with fire-mane tossing and flashing heels.
1138,SHE,
1139,SHE,"The roar of the race-course died behind them,"
1140,SHE,"In front were their Fates, they rode to find them,"
1141,SHE,"With the wills of men, with the strengths of horses,"
1142,SHE,They dared the minute with all their forces.
1143,SHE,
1144,SHE,
1145,SHE,
1146,SHE,
1147,SHE,
1148,PART II,PART II
1149,PART II,
1150,PART II,
1151,PART II,"Still pulling double, black Kubbadar led,"
1152,PART II,Pulling his rider half over his head;
1153,PART II,"Soyland's cream jacket was spotted with red,"
1154,PART II,Spotted with dirt from the rush of their tread.
1155,PART II,
1156,PART II,"Bright bay Sir Lopez, the loveliest there,"
1157,PART II,"Galloped at ease as though taking the air,"
1158,PART II,Well in his compass with plenty to spare.
1159,PART II,"Gavotte and The Ghost and the brown Counter Vair,"
1160,PART II,"Followed him close with Syringa the mare,"
1161,PART II,"And the roan horse Red Ember who went like a hare,"
1162,PART II,"And Forward-Ho bolting, though his rider did swear."
1163,PART II,
1164,PART II,"Keeping this order, they reached the next fence,"
1165,PART II,Which was living plashed blackthorn with gorse-toppings dense;
1166,PART II,In the gloom of its darkness it loomed up immense.
1167,PART II,Forward-Ho's glory had conquered his sense
1168,PART II,"And he rushed it, not rising, and never went thence."
1169,PART II,
1170,PART II,"And down in the ditch where the gorse-spikes were scattered,"
1171,PART II,"That bright chestnut's soul from his body was shattered,"
1172,PART II,And his rider shed tears on the dear head all spattered.
1173,PART II,
1174,PART II,"King Tony came down, but got up with a stumble,"
1175,PART II,"His rider went sideways, but knew how to tumble,"
1176,PART II,"And got up and remounted, though the pain made him humble,"
1177,PART II,And he rode fifty yards and then stopped in a fumble.
1178,PART II,
1179,PART II,With a rush and a crashing Right Royal went over
1180,PART II,"With the stride of a stalwart and the blood of a lover,"
1181,PART II,He landed on stubble now pushing with clover.
1182,PART II,
1183,PART II,"And just as he landed, the March sun shone bright"
1184,PART II,And the blue sky showed flamelike and the dun clouds turned white;
1185,PART II,"The little larks panted aloft their delight,"
1186,PART II,Trembling and singing as though one with the light.
1187,PART II,
1188,PART II,"And Charles, as he rode, felt the joy of their singing,"
1189,PART II,"While over the clover the horses went stringing,"
1190,PART II,"And up from Right Royal the message came winging,"
1191,PART II,"""It is my day to-day, though the pace may be stinging,"
1192,PART II,
1193,PART II,"Though the jumps be all danger and the going all clinging."""
1194,PART II,"The white, square church-tower with its weather-cocks swinging,"
1195,PART II,Rose up on the right above grass and dark plough
1196,PART II,Where the elm trees' black branches had bud on the bough.
1197,PART II,
1198,PART II,"Riderless Thankful strode on at his side,"
1199,PART II,"His bright stirrup-irons flew up at each stride,"
1200,PART II,"Being free, in this gallop, had filled him with pride."
1201,PART II,"Charles thought, ""What would come, if he ran out or shied?"
1202,PART II,"I wish from my heart that the brute would keep wide."""
1203,PART II,"Coranto drew up on Right Royal's near quarter,"
1204,PART II,Beyond lay a hurdle and ditch full of water.
1205,PART II,
1206,PART II,"And now as they neared it, Right Royal took heed"
1207,PART II,Of the distance to go and the steps he would need;
1208,PART II,"He cocked to the effort with eyes bright as gleed,"
1209,PART II,Then Coranto's wide wallow shot past him at speed:
1210,PART II,"His rider's ""Hup, hup, now!"" called out quick and cheerly,"
1211,PART II,"Sent him over in style, but Right Royal jumped early."
1212,PART II,
1213,PART II,"Just a second too soon, and from some feet too far,"
1214,PART II,Charles learned the mistake as he struck the top bar;
1215,PART II,"Then the water flashed skywards, the earth gave a jar,"
1216,PART II,"And the man on Coranto looked back with ""Aha!"
1217,PART II,"That'll teach you, my son."" Then with straining of leather,"
1218,PART II,Grey Glory and Monkery landed together.
1219,PART II,
1220,PART II,"For a second the stunning kept Charles from his pain,"
1221,PART II,"Then his sense flooded back, making everything plain."
1222,PART II,"He was down on the mud, but he still held the rein;"
1223,PART II,Right Royal was heaving his haunch from the drain.
1224,PART II,"The field was ahead of him, going like rain,"
1225,PART II,"And though the plough held them, they went like the wind"
1226,PART II,To the eyes of a man left so badly behind.
1227,PART II,
1228,PART II,"Charles climbed to his feet as Right Royal crawled out,"
1229,PART II,"He said, ""That's extinction beyond any doubt."""
1230,PART II,"On the plough, on and on, went the rush of the rout."
1231,PART II,
1232,PART II,"Charles mounted and rode, for his courage was stout,"
1233,PART II,"And he would not give in till the end of the bout,"
1234,PART II,But plastered with poachings he rode on forsaken:
1235,PART II,He had lost thirty lengths and his horse had been shaken.
1236,PART II,
1237,PART II,"Across the wet ploughland he took a good pull,"
1238,PART II,"With the thought that the cup of his sorrow was full,"
1239,PART II,For the speed of a stag and the strength of a bull
1240,PART II,Could hardly recover the ground he had lost.
1241,PART II,"Right Royal went dully, then snorted and tost,"
1242,PART II,
1243,PART II,"Tost his head, with a whicker, went on, and went kind,"
1244,PART II,And the horse's great spirit touched Charles in the mind.
1245,PART II,"Though his bruise made him dizzy and tears made him blind,"
1246,PART II,"He would try to the finish, and so they should find."
1247,PART II,"He was last, thirty lengths. Here he took in his sails,"
1248,PART II,For the field had come crash at the white post and rails.
1249,PART II,
1250,PART II,"Here Sir Francis ran out, scaring all who stood near,"
1251,PART II,Going crash through the rail like a runaway deer.
1252,PART II,"Then the riderless Thankful upset Mutineer,"
1253,PART II,"Dakkanese, in refusing, wheeled round like a top"
1254,PART II,Into Culverin's shoulder which made them both stop.
1255,PART II,
1256,PART II,"They reeled from the shock, slithered sideways, and crashed,"
1257,PART II,"Dakkanese on the guard-rail which gave, and then smashed."
1258,PART II,"As he rolled, the near shoes of the Culverin flashed"
1259,PART II,"High in air for a moment, bright iron in strain:"
1260,PART II,Then he rose with no rider and tripped in his rein.
1261,PART II,
1262,PART II,Right Royal came up as the Dakkanese rose
1263,PART II,All trembling and cowed as though beaten with blows;
1264,PART II,The Culverin stumbled with the reins in his toes;
1265,PART II,"On the far side the leap stood the Mutineer grazing,"
1266,PART II,His man was a heap which some fellows were raising.
1267,PART II,
1268,PART II,"Right Royal strode on, through a second wet plough,"
1269,PART II,With the field far ahead (Kubbadar in the bow).
1270,PART II,"Charles thought, ""Kubbadar's got away from him now."
1271,PART II,"Well, it's little to me, for they're so far ahead"
1272,PART II,"That they'll never come back, though I ride myself dead."""
1273,PART II,
1274,PART II,"Right Royal bored forward and leaned on his hand,"
1275,PART II,"""Good boy,"" said his master. ""He must understand."
1276,PART II,You're the one friend I'll have when I've sold all my land.
1277,PART II,"God pity my Em as we come past the Stand,"
1278,PART II,"Last of all, and all muddy; but now for Jim's Pitch."""
1279,PART II,"Four feet of gorse fence, then a fifteen foot ditch."
1280,PART II,
1281,PART II,And the fifteen foot ditch glittered bright to the brim
1282,PART II,With the brook that ran through it where the grayling did swim;
1283,PART II,"In the shallows it sparkled, in the deeps it was dim,"
1284,PART II,"When the race was first run it had nearly drowned Jim,"
1285,PART II,And now the bright irons of twenty-four horses
1286,PART II,Were to flicker its ripples with knockings of gorses.
1287,PART II,
1288,PART II,From far in the rear Charles could watch them take hold
1289,PART II,Of their horses and push them across the light mould;
1290,PART II,"How their ears all cocked forward, how the drumming hoofs rolled!"
1291,PART II,"Kubbadar, far ahead, flew across like a bird,"
1292,PART II,"Then Soyland, bad second, with Muscatel third."
1293,PART II,
1294,PART II,"Then Sir Lopez, and Path Finder, striding alone,"
1295,PART II,"Then the good horse, Red Ember, the flea-bitten roan."
1296,PART II,Then the little Gavotte bearing less than ten stone.
1297,PART II,Then a crowd of all colours with Peterkinooks
1298,PART II,"Going strong as a whale goes, head up and out flukes."
1299,PART II,
1300,PART II,"And then as Charles watched, as the shoulders went back,"
1301,PART II,"The riderless Thankful swerved left off the track,"
1302,PART II,Crossing just to the front of the Cimmeroon black.
1303,PART II,"Ere the rider could see what his horse was about,"
1304,PART II,"Cimmeroon swerved, like Thankful, and followed him out."
1305,PART II,
1306,PART II,Across the great grass in the midst of the course
1307,PART II,"Cimmeroon ran a match race with the riderless horse,"
1308,PART II,"Then the rider took charge, part by skill part by force;"
1309,PART II,He turned Cimmeroon to re-enter the race
1310,PART II,Seven lengths behind Charles in the post of disgrace.
1311,PART II,
1312,PART II,"Beyond the next fence, at the top of a slope,"
1313,PART II,Charles saw his field fading and gave up all hope.
1314,PART II,"Yet he said, ""Any error will knot me my rope."
1315,PART II,I wish that some power would help me to see
1316,PART II,What would give the best chance for Right Royal and me.
1317,PART II,
1318,PART II,"Shall I hurry downhill, to catch up when I can?"
1319,PART II,"Being last is the devil for horse and for man,"
1320,PART II,For it makes the horse slack and it makes the man sick.
1321,PART II,"Well, I've got to decide and I've got to be quick."
1322,PART II,
1323,PART II,"I had better catch up, for if I should be last,"
1324,PART II,It would kill my poor Emmy to see me come past.
1325,PART II,"I cannot leave Emmy to suffer like that,"
1326,PART II,"So I'll hurry downhill and then pull on the flat."""
1327,PART II,
1328,PART II,"So he thought, so he settled, but then, as he stirred,"
1329,PART II,Right Royal's ears moved like a vicious man's word;
1330,PART II,"So he thought, ""If I try it, the horse will refuse."""
1331,PART II,So he gave up the project and shook in his shoes.
1332,PART II,
1333,PART II,"Then he thought, ""Since the horse will not stand interference,"
1334,PART II,"I must even sit quiet and sink the appearance,"
1335,PART II,"Since his nerves have been touched, it's as well we're alone."""
1336,PART II,He turned down the hill with his heart like a stone.
1337,PART II,
1338,PART II,"""But,"" he cried, ""they'll come back, for they've gone such a burst"
1339,PART II,"That they'll all soon be panting, in need to be nursed,"
1340,PART II,"They will surely come back, but to wait till they do,"
1341,PART II,"Lord, it's hell to the waiter, it cuts a man through."""
1342,PART II,
1343,PART II,"Then into his mind came the Avalon case,"
1344,PART II,"When a man, left at post, without hope of a place,"
1345,PART II,"First had suffered in patience, then had wormed his way up,"
1346,PART II,"Then had come with fine judgment, and just won the Cup."
1347,PART II,
1348,PART II,"Hoofs thundered behind him, the Cimmeroon caught him,"
1349,PART II,His man cursing Thankful and the sire who wrought him.
1350,PART II,"""Did you see that brown devil?"" he cried as he passed;"
1351,PART II,"""He carried me out, but I'll never be last."
1352,PART II,
1353,PART II,"Just the wrong side the water the brute gave a swerve,"
1354,PART II,"And he carried me out, half across the course-curve."
1355,PART II,"Look, he's cut right across now, we'll meet him again."
1356,PART II,"Well, I hope someone knocks him and kicks out his brain."
1357,PART II,
1358,PART II,"Well, I'll never be last, though I can't win the Cup."
1359,PART II,"No sense lolling here, man, you'd better pull up."""
1360,PART II,"Then he roused Cimmeroon, and was off like a swallow."
1361,PART II,
1362,PART II,"Charles watched, sick at heart, with a longing to follow."
1363,PART II,
1364,PART II,"""Better follow,"" he thought, ""for he knows more than I,"
1365,PART II,"Since he rode here before, and it's wiser to try:"
1366,PART II,"Would my horse had but wings, would his feet would but lift;"
1367,PART II,Would we spun on this speedway as wind spins the drift.
1368,PART II,
1369,PART II,"There they go out of sight, over fence, to the Turn;"
1370,PART II,"They are going still harder, they leave me astern."
1371,PART II,"They will never come back, I am lost past recall."""
1372,PART II,So he cried for a comfort and only gat gall.
1373,PART II,
1374,PART II,"In the glittering branches of the world without end,"
1375,PART II,"Were the spirits, Em's Helper and Charles Cothill's Friend,"
1376,PART II,And the Force of Right Royal with a crinier of flame
1377,PART II,There they breathed the bright glory till the summoning came.
1378,PART II,
1379,PART II,"From the Stand where Em watched, from the field where Charles rode,"
1380,PART II,"From the mud where Right Royal in solitude strode,"
1381,PART II,"Came the call of three spirits to the spirits that guard,"
1382,PART II,"Crying, ""Up now, and help him, for the danger bears hard."""
1383,PART II,
1384,PART II,"There they looked, those immortals, from the boughs dropping balm,"
1385,PART II,"But their powers were stirred not, and their grave brows were calm,"
1386,PART II,"For they said, ""He's despairing and the horse is still vext."""
1387,PART II,Charles cleared Channing's Blackthorn and strode to the next.
1388,PART II,
1389,PART II,The next was the Turn in a bogland of rushes;
1390,PART II,There the springs of still water were trampled to slushes;
1391,PART II,"The peewits lamented, flapping down, flagging far,"
1392,PART II,The riders dared deathwards each trusting his star.
1393,PART II,
1394,PART II,"The mud made them slither, the turn made them close,"
1395,PART II,"The stirrup steels clinked as they thrust in their toes,"
1396,PART II,"The brown horse Exception was struck as he rose,"
1397,PART II,"Struck to earth by the Rocket, then kicked by the grey,"
1398,PART II,Then Thunderbolt smote him and rolled him astray.
1399,PART II,
1400,PART II,"The man on Exception, Bun Manor, fell clear"
1401,PART II,"With Monkery's shoes half an inch from his ear,"
1402,PART II,"A drench of wet mud from the hoofs struck his cheek,"
1403,PART II,But the race was gone from him before he could speak.
1404,PART II,
1405,PART II,"There Exception and Thunderbolt ended their race,"
1406,PART II,Their bright flanks all smeared with the mud of the place;
1407,PART II,In the green fields of Tencombe and the grey downs of Churn
1408,PART II,Their names had been glories till they fell at the Turn.
1409,PART II,
1410,PART II,Em prayed in her place that her lover might know
1411,PART II,Not to hurry Right Royal but let him go slow;
1412,PART II,"White-lipped from her praying, she sat, with shut eyes,"
1413,PART II,"Begging help from her Helper, the deathless, the wise."
1414,PART II,
1415,PART II,"From the gold of his branches her Helper took heed,"
1416,PART II,He sent forth a thought to help Charles in his need.
1417,PART II,"As the white, gleaming gannet eyes fish in the sea,"
1418,PART II,So the thought sought a mortal to bring this to be.
1419,PART II,
1420,PART II,By the side of Exception Bun Manor now stood
1421,PART II,Sopping rags on a hock that was dripping bright blood.
1422,PART II,"He had known Charles of old and defeat made him kind,"
1423,PART II,The thought from the Helper came into his mind.
1424,PART II,
1425,PART II,"So he cried to Charles Cothill, ""Go easy,"" he cried,"
1426,PART II,"""Don't hurry; don't worry; sit still and keep wide."
1427,PART II,"They flowed like the Severn, they'll ebb like the tide."
1428,PART II,"They'll come back and you'll catch them."" His voice died away."
1429,PART II,"In front lay the Dyke, deep as drowning, steel grey."
1430,PART II,
1431,PART II,Charles felt his horse see it and stir at the sight.
1432,PART II,Again his heart lifted to the dream of the night;
1433,PART II,"Once again in his heart's blood the horse seemed to say,"
1434,PART II,"""I'll die or I'll do it. It's my day to-day."""
1435,PART II,
1436,PART II,"He saw the grey water in shade from its fence,"
1437,PART II,The rows of white faces all staring intense;
1438,PART II,"All the heads straining forward, all the shoulders packt dense."
1439,PART II,"Beyond, he saw Thankful, the riderless brown,"
1440,PART II,"Snatching grass, dodging capture, with reins hanging down."
1441,PART II,
1442,PART II,"Then Thankful stopped eating and cocked up his head,"
1443,PART II,"He eyed the swift horses that Kubbadar led,"
1444,PART II,His eye filled with fire at the roll of their tread;
1445,PART II,"Then he tore down the course with a flash of bright shoes,"
1446,PART II,As the race's bright herald on fire with news.
1447,PART II,
1448,PART II,"As Charles neared the water, the Rocket ran out"
1449,PART II,By jumping the railings and kicking a clout
1450,PART II,Of rotten white woodwork to startle the trout.
1451,PART II,"When Charles cleared the water, the grass stretcht before"
1452,PART II,And the glory of going burned in to the core.
1453,PART II,
1454,PART II,Far over his head with a whicker of wings
1455,PART II,Came a wisp of five snipe from a field full of springs;
1456,PART II,The gleam on their feathers went wavering past--
1457,PART II,And then some men booed him for being the last.
1458,PART II,
1459,PART II,"But last though he was, all his blood was on fire"
1460,PART II,"With the rush of the wind and the gleam of the mire,"
1461,PART II,"And the leap of his heart to the skylarks in quire,"
1462,PART II,"And the feel of his horse going onward, on, on,"
1463,PART II,Under sky with white banners and bright sun that shone.
1464,PART II,
1465,PART II,"Like a star in the night, like a spring in the waste,"
1466,PART II,"The image of Emmy rose up as he raced,"
1467,PART II,"Till his mind was made calm, and his spirit was braced."
1468,PART II,For the prize was bright Emmy; his blood beat and beat
1469,PART II,As her beauty made music in that thunder of feet.
1470,PART II,
1471,PART II,"The wind was whirled past him, it hummed in his ears,"
1472,PART II,"Right Royal's excitement had banished his fears,"
1473,PART II,"For his leap was like singing, his stride was like cheers,"
1474,PART II,"All his blood was in glory, all his soul was blown bare,"
1475,PART II,"They were one, blood and purpose, they strode through the air."
1476,PART II,
1477,PART II,"""What is life if I lose her, what is death if I win?"
1478,PART II,At the end of this living the new lives begin.
1479,PART II,"Whatever life may be, whatever death is,"
1480,PART II,"I am spirit eternal, I am this, I am this!"""
1481,PART II,
1482,PART II,"Girls waved, and men shouted, like flashes, like shots,"
1483,PART II,Out of pale blurs of faces whose features were dots;
1484,PART II,"Two fences with toppings were cleared without hitch,"
1485,PART II,"Then they ran for Lost Lady's, a fence and dry ditch."
1486,PART II,
1487,PART II,"Here Monkery's rider, on seeing a chance,"
1488,PART II,Shot out beyond Soyland to lead the advance.
1489,PART II,Then he steadied and summed up his field with a glance.
1490,PART II,"All crossed the Lost Lady's, that dry ditch of fear,"
1491,PART II,"Then a roar broke about them, the race-course was near."
1492,PART II,
1493,PART II,"Right and left were the swing-boats and merry-go-rounds,"
1494,PART II,"Yellow varnish that wavered, machines making sounds,"
1495,PART II,"Rifles cracking like cork-pops, fifes whining with steam,"
1496,PART II,"""All hot,"" from a pieman; all blurred as in dream."
1497,PART II,
1498,PART II,"Then the motors, then cheering, then the brass of a band,"
1499,PART II,Then the white rails all crowded with a mob on each hand.
1500,PART II,Then they swerved to the left over gorsebush and hurdle
1501,PART II,And they rushed for the Water where a man's blood might curdle.
1502,PART II,
1503,PART II,Charles entered the race-course and prayed in his mind
1504,PART II,"That love for the moment might make Emmy blind,"
1505,PART II,Not see him come past half a distance behind;
1506,PART II,"For an instant he thought, ""I must shove on ahead,"
1507,PART II,"For to pass her like this, Lord, I'd rather be dead."""
1508,PART II,
1509,PART II,"Then, in crossing the hurdle the Stand arose plain,"
1510,PART II,"All the flags, horns and cheers beat like blows on his brain,"
1511,PART II,"And he thought, ""Time to race when I come here again,"
1512,PART II,"If I once lose my head, I'll be lost past appeal."""
1513,PART II,All the crowd flickered past like a film on a reel.
1514,PART II,
1515,PART II,"Like a ribbon, whirled past him, all painted with eyes."
1516,PART II,"All the real, as he rode, was the horse at his thighs,"
1517,PART II,"And the thought ""They'll come back, if I've luck, if I'm wise."""
1518,PART II,"Some banners uncrumpled on the blue of the skies,"
1519,PART II,"The cheers became frantic, the blur of men shook,"
1520,PART II,As Thankful and Kubbadar went at the brook.
1521,PART II,
1522,PART II,"Neck and neck, stride for stride, they increased as they neared it,"
1523,PART II,"Though the danger gleamed greyly, they galloped to beard it;"
1524,PART II,"And Kubbadar dwelt on his jump as he cleared it,"
1525,PART II,While Thankful went on with a half a length lead.
1526,PART II,"Charles thought, ""Kubbadar, there, is going to seed."""
1527,PART II,
1528,PART II,"Then Monkery took it, then Soyland, then two,"
1529,PART II,"Muscatel and Sir Lopez, who leaped not but flew,"
1530,PART II,"Like a pair of June swallows going over the dew,"
1531,PART II,"Like a flight of bright fishes from a field of seas blue,"
1532,PART II,Like a wisp of snipe wavering in the dusk out of view.
1533,PART II,"Then Red Ember, Path Finder, Gavotte and Coranto,"
1534,PART II,"Then The Ghost going level by Syringa a-taunto,"
1535,PART II,"Then Peterkinooks, then the Cimmeroon black,"
1536,PART II,"Who had gone to his horses, not let them come back;"
1537,PART II,"Then Stormalong rousing, then the Blowbury crack,"
1538,PART II,"Counter Vair, going grandly beside Cross-Molin,"
1539,PART II,All charged the bright brook and Coranto went in.
1540,PART II,
1541,PART II,"Natuna, Grey Glory and Hadrian followed,"
1542,PART II,Flying clear of the water where Coranto now wallowed;
1543,PART II,Cannonade leaped so big that the lookers-on holloed.
1544,PART II,"Ere the splash from Coranto was bright on the grass,"
1545,PART II,The face of the water had seen them all pass.
1546,PART II,
1547,PART II,"But Coranto half scrambled, then slipped on his side,"
1548,PART II,Then churned in the mud till the brook was all dyed;
1549,PART II,"As Charles reached the water Coranto's man cried,"
1550,PART II,"""Put him at it like blazes and give him a switch;"
1551,PART II,"Jump big, man, for God's sake, I'm down in the ditch."""
1552,PART II,
1553,PART II,"Right Royal went at it and streamed like a comet,"
1554,PART II,"And the next thing Charles knew, he was twenty yards from it;"
1555,PART II,"And he thought about Em as he rushed past her place,"
1556,PART II,With a prayer for God's peace on her beautiful face.
1557,PART II,
1558,PART II,"Then he tried to keep steady. ""O steady,"" he said,"
1559,PART II,"""I'm riding with judgment, not leading a raid,"
1560,PART II,"And I'm getting excited, and there's Cannonade."
1561,PART II,"What's the matter?"" he shouted, as Royal swept past."
1562,PART II,"""Sprained!"" shouted the man, ""Overjumped, at the last."""
1563,PART II,
1564,PART II,"""Rough luck,"" shouted Charles. Then the crowd dropped away,"
1565,PART II,"Then the sun shone behind him, the bright turned to grey;"
1566,PART II,"They were round, the first time, they were streaming away"
1567,PART II,For the second time round. There the starting-post shone.
1568,PART II,Then they swung round the curve and went galloping on.
1569,PART II,
1570,PART II,"All the noise died behind, Fate was waiting in front,"
1571,PART II,"Now the racing began, they had done with the hunt."
1572,PART II,With the sunlight behind him Charles saw how they went;
1573,PART II,"No nearer, but further, and only one spent."
1574,PART II,
1575,PART II,"Only Kubbadar dwelling, the rest going strong,"
1576,PART II,"Taking jump after jump as a bird takes a song,"
1577,PART II,"Their thirty lengths' lead seemed a weary way long,"
1578,PART II,"It seemed to grow longer, it seemed to increase:"
1579,PART II,"""This is bitter,"" he said. ""May it be for my peace."
1580,PART II,
1581,PART II,"My dream was a glimpse of the world beyond sense,"
1582,PART II,All beauty and wisdom are messages thence.
1583,PART II,There the difference of bodies and the strain of control
1584,PART II,"Are removed; beast with man speaks, and spirit with soul."
1585,PART II,
1586,PART II,"My vision was wisdom, or the World as it Is."
1587,PART II,"Fate rules us, not Wisdom, whose ways are not his,"
1588,PART II,"Fate, weaponed with all things, has willed that I fall;"
1589,PART II,"So be it, Fate orders, and we go to the wall."
1590,PART II,
1591,PART II,"Go down to the beaten, who have come to the truth"
1592,PART II,"That is deeper than sorrow and stronger than youth,"
1593,PART II,"That is God, the foundation, who sees and is just"
1594,PART II,To the beauty within us who are nothing but dust.
1595,PART II,
1596,PART II,"Yet, Royal, my comrade, before Fate decides,"
1597,PART II,"His hand stays, uncertain, like the sea between tides,"
1598,PART II,"Then a man has a moment, if he strike not too late,"
1599,PART II,"When his soul shakes the world-soul, and can even change Fate,"
1600,PART II,
1601,PART II,"So you and I, Royal, before we give in"
1602,PART II,"Will spend blood and soul in our effort to win,"
1603,PART II,"And if all be proved vain when our effort is sped,"
1604,PART II,"May the hoofs of our conquerors trample us dead."""
1605,PART II,
1606,PART II,"Then the soul of Right Royal thrilled up through each hand,"
1607,PART II,"""We are one, for this gallop; we both understand."
1608,PART II,"If my lungs give me breathing, if my loins stand the strain,"
1609,PART II,You may lash me to strips and it shan't be in vain.
1610,PART II,
1611,PART II,"For to-day, in this hour, my Power will come"
1612,PART II,From my Past to my Present (and a Spirit gives some).
1613,PART II,"We have gone many gallops, we two, in the past,"
1614,PART II,When I go with my Power you will know me at last.
1615,PART II,
1616,PART II,"You remember the morning when the red leaf hung still,"
1617,PART II,"When they found in the beech-clump on Lollingdon Hill,"
1618,PART II,When we led past the Sheep Fold and along the Fair Mile?
1619,PART II,"When I go with my Power, that will not seem worth while."
1620,PART II,
1621,PART II,"Then the day in the valley when we found in the wood,"
1622,PART II,"When we led all the gallop to the river in flood,"
1623,PART II,"And the sun burst out shining as the fox took the stream,"
1624,PART II,"When I go with my Power, that will all seem a dream."
1625,PART II,
1626,PART II,Then the day on the Downland when we went like the light
1627,PART II,"From the spring by Hurst Compton till the Clump was in sight,"
1628,PART II,"Till we killed by The Romans, where Blowbury is,"
1629,PART II,All the best of that gallop shall be nothing to this.
1630,PART II,
1631,PART II,"If I failed in the past with my Power away,"
1632,PART II,"I was only my shadow, it was not my day,"
1633,PART II,"So I sulked like my sire, or shrank, like my dam;"
1634,PART II,Now I come to my Power you will know what I am.
1635,PART II,
1636,PART II,"I've the strength, you've the brain, we are running as one"
1637,PART II,And nothing on earth can be lost till it's won.
1638,PART II,"If I live to the end, naught shall put you to shame."""
1639,PART II,"So he thrilled, going flame-like, with a crinier of flame."
1640,PART II,
1641,PART II,"""Yet,"" he thrilled, ""It may be, that before the end come"
1642,PART II,"Death will touch me, the Changer, and carry me home."
1643,PART II,"For we know not, O master, when our life shall have rest,"
1644,PART II,But the Life is near change that has uttered its best.
1645,PART II,"If we grow like the grasses, we fall like the flower,"
1646,PART II,"And I know, I touch Death when I come to my Power."""
1647,PART II,
1648,PART II,"Now over the course flew invisible birds,"
1649,PART II,"All the Wants of the Watchers, all the thoughts and winged words,"
1650,PART II,Swift as floatings of fire from a bonfire's crest
1651,PART II,"When they burn leaves on Kimble and the fire streams west,"
1652,PART II,
1653,PART II,"Bright an instant, then dying, but renewed and renewed,"
1654,PART II,"So the thoughts chased the racers like hounds that pursued,"
1655,PART II,"Bringing cheer to their darlings, bringing curse to their foes,"
1656,PART II,Searching into men's spirits till their Powers arose.
1657,PART II,
1658,PART II,"Red and rigid the Powers of the riding men were,"
1659,PART II,"And as sea birds on Ailsa, in the nesting time there,"
1660,PART II,"Rise like leaves in a whirlwind and float like leaves blown,"
1661,PART II,So the wants chased the riders and fought for their own.
1662,PART II,
1663,PART II,"Unseen by the riders, from the myriad tense brains"
1664,PART II,"Came the living thoughts flying to clutch at men's reins,"
1665,PART II,Clearing paths for their darlings by running in cry
1666,PART II,At the heads of their rivals till the darlings gat by.
1667,PART II,
1668,PART II,"As in football, when forwards heave all in a pack,"
1669,PART II,"With their arms round each other and their heels heeling back,"
1670,PART II,"And their bodies all straining, as they heave, and men fall,"
1671,PART II,"And the halves hover hawklike to pounce on the ball,"
1672,PART II,"And the runners poise ready, while the mass of hot men"
1673,PART II,"Heaves and slips, like rough bullocks making play in a pen,"
1674,PART II,"And the crowd sees the heaving, and is still, till it break,"
1675,PART II,So the riders endeavoured as they strained for the stake.
1676,PART II,
1677,PART II,"They skimmed through the grassland, they came to the plough,"
1678,PART II,"The wind rushed behind them like the waves from a prow,"
1679,PART II,The clods rose behind them with speckles of gold
1680,PART II,From the iron-crusht coltsfoot flung up from the mould.
1681,PART II,
1682,PART II,"All green was the plough with the thrusts of young corn,"
1683,PART II,"Pools gleamed in the ruts that the cartwheels had worn,"
1684,PART II,And Kubbadar's man wished he had not been born.
1685,PART II,"Natuna was weary and dwelt on her stride,"
1686,PART II,"Grey Glory's grey tail rolled about, side to side."
1687,PART II,
1688,PART II,"Then swish, came a shower, from a driving grey cloud"
1689,PART II,Though the blue sky shone brightly and the larks sang aloud.
1690,PART II,"As the squall of rain pelted, the coloured caps bowed,"
1691,PART II,"With Thankful still leading and Monkery close,"
1692,PART II,"The hoofs smacked the clayland, the flying clods rose."
1693,PART II,
1694,PART II,"They slowed on the clayland, the rain pelted by,"
1695,PART II,The end of a rainbow gleamed out in the sky;
1696,PART II,"Natuna dropped back till Charles heard her complain,"
1697,PART II,"Grey Glory's forequarters seemed hung on his rein,"
1698,PART II,Cimmeroon clearly was feeling the strain.
1699,PART II,"But the little Gavotte skimmed the clay like a witch,"
1700,PART II,Charles saw her coquet as she went at Jim's Pitch.
1701,PART II,
1702,PART II,"They went at Jim's Pitch, through the deeply dug gaps"
1703,PART II,"Where the hoofs of great horses had kicked off the scraps,"
1704,PART II,"And there at the water they met with mishaps,"
1705,PART II,For Natuna stopped dead and Grey Glory went in
1706,PART II,And a cannon on landing upset Cross-Molin.
1707,PART II,
1708,PART II,"As swallows bound northward when apple-bloom blows,"
1709,PART II,"See laggards drop spent from their flight as it goes,"
1710,PART II,Yet can pause not in Heaven as they scythe the thin air
1711,PART II,"But go on to the house-eaves and the nests clinging bare,"
1712,PART II,"So Charles flashed beyond them, those three men the less"
1713,PART II,Who had gone to get glory and met with distress.
1714,PART II,
1715,PART II,"He rode to the rise-top, and saw, down the slope,"
1716,PART II,The race far ahead at a steady strong lope
1717,PART II,"Going over the grassland, too well for his peace,"
1718,PART II,They were steady as oxen and strong as wild geese.
1719,PART II,
1720,PART II,As a man by a cornfield on a windy wild day
1721,PART II,"Sees the corn bow in shadows ever hurrying away,"
1722,PART II,"And wonders, in watching, when the light with bright feet"
1723,PART II,"Will harry those shadows from the ears of the wheat,"
1724,PART II,"So Charles, as he watched, wondered when the bright face"
1725,PART II,Of the finish would blaze on that smouldering race.
1726,PART II,
1727,PART II,"On the last of the grass, ere the going was dead,"
1728,PART II,"Counter Vair's man shot out with his horse by the head,"
1729,PART II,"Like a partridge put up from the stubble he sped,"
1730,PART II,He dropped Kubbadar and he flew by Bed Ember
1731,PART II,Up to Monkery's girth like a leaf in November.
1732,PART II,
1733,PART II,"Then Stormalong followed, and went to the front,"
1734,PART II,"And just as the find puts a flame to a hunt,"
1735,PART II,So the rush of those horses put flame to the race.
1736,PART II,Charles saw them all shaken to quickening pace.
1737,PART II,
1738,PART II,"And Monkery moved, not to let them go by,"
1739,PART II,And the steadiest rider made ready to fly;
1740,PART II,"Well into the wet land they leaped from the dry,"
1741,PART II,"They scattered the rain-pools that mirrored the sky,"
1742,PART II,They crashed down the rushes that pushed from the plough.
1743,PART II,"And Charles longed to follow, but muttered ""Not now."""
1744,PART II,
1745,PART II,"""Not now,"" so he thought, ""Yet if not"" (he said) ""when"
1746,PART II,Shall I come to those horses and scupper their men?
1747,PART II,"Will they never come back? Shall I never get up?"""
1748,PART II,So he drank bitter gall from a very cold cup.
1749,PART II,
1750,PART II,"But he nursed his horse gently and prayed for the best,"
1751,PART II,"And he caught Cimmeroon, who was sadly distrest,"
1752,PART II,"And he passed Cimmeroon, with the thought that the black"
1753,PART II,Was as nearly dead beat as the man on his back.
1754,PART II,"Then he gained on his field who were galled by the Churn,"
1755,PART II,The plough searched them out as they came to the Turn.
1756,PART II,"But Gavotte, black and coral, went strong as a spate"
1757,PART II,"Charles thought ""She's a flier and she carries no weight."""
1758,PART II,
1759,PART II,"And now, beyond question the field began tailing,"
1760,PART II,"For all had been tested and many were ailing,"
1761,PART II,"The riders were weary, the horses were failing,"
1762,PART II,The blur of bright colours rolled over the railing.
1763,PART II,
1764,PART II,"With the grunts of urged horses, and the oaths of hot men,"
1765,PART II,"""Gerr on, you,"" ""Come on, now,"" agen and agen;"
1766,PART II,They spattered the mud on the willow tree's bole
1767,PART II,And they charged at the danger; and the danger took toll.
1768,PART II,
1769,PART II,"For Monkery landed, but dwelt on the fence"
1770,PART II,So that Counter Vair passed him in galloping thence.
1771,PART II,"Then Stormalong blundered, then bright Muscatel"
1772,PART II,"Slipped badly on landing and stumbled and fell,"
1773,PART II,
1774,PART II,"Then rose in the morrish, with his man on his neck"
1775,PART II,"Like a nearly dead sailor afloat on a wreck,"
1776,PART II,"With his whip in the mud and his stirrups both gone,"
1777,PART II,Yet he kept in the saddle and made him go on.
1778,PART II,
1779,PART II,"As Charles leaped the Turn, all the field was tailed out"
1780,PART II,"Like petals of roses that wind blows about,"
1781,PART II,"Like petals of colour blown back and brought near,"
1782,PART II,"Like poppies in wind-flaws when corn is in ear,"
1783,PART II,"Fate held them or sped them, the race was beginning."
1784,PART II,"Charles said, ""I must ride, or I've no chance of winning."""
1785,PART II,
1786,PART II,"So gently he quickened, yet making no call;"
1787,PART II,"Right Royal replied as though knowing it all,"
1788,PART II,"He passed Kubbadar who was ready to fall,"
1789,PART II,"Then he strode up to Hadrian, up to his girth,"
1790,PART II,They eyed the Dyke's glitter and picked out a berth.
1791,PART II,
1792,PART II,Now the race reached the water and over it flew
1793,PART II,In a sweep of great muscle strained taut and guyed true.
1794,PART II,"There Muscatel floundered and came to a halt,"
1795,PART II,"Muscatel, the bay chaser without any fault."
1796,PART II,
1797,PART II,"Right Royal's head lifted, Right Royal took charge,"
1798,PART II,"On the left near the railings, ears cocked, going large,"
1799,PART II,Leaving Hadrian behind as a yacht leaves a barge.
1800,PART II,"Though Hadrian's rider called something unheard,"
1801,PART II,"He was past him at speed like the albatross bird,"
1802,PART II,"Running up to Path Finder, they leaped, side by side,"
1803,PART II,And the foam from Path Finder flecked white on his hide.
1804,PART II,
1805,PART II,"And on landing, he lifted, while Path Finder dwelt,"
1806,PART II,"And his noble eye brightened from the glory he felt,"
1807,PART II,"And the mud flung behind him flicked Path Finder's chest,"
1808,PART II,As he left him behind and went on to the rest.
1809,PART II,
1810,PART II,"Charles cast a glance back, but he could not divine"
1811,PART II,"Why the man on Path Finder should make him a sign,"
1812,PART II,"Nor why Hadrian's rider should shout, and then point,"
1813,PART II,With his head nodded forward and a jerked elbow joint.
1814,PART II,
1815,PART II,"But he looked as he pointed, both forward and down,"
1816,PART II,"And he saw that Right Royal was smeared like a clown,"
1817,PART II,"Smeared red and bespattered with flecks of bright blood,"
1818,PART II,"From a blood-vessel burst, as he well understood."
1819,PART II,
1820,PART II,"And just as he saw it, Right Royal went strange"
1821,PART II,As one whom Death's finger has touched to a change;
1822,PART II,"He went with a stagger that sickened the soul,"
1823,PART II,As a force stricken feeble and out of control.
1824,PART II,
1825,PART II,"Charles thought, ""He is dying, and this is the end,"
1826,PART II,I am losing my Emmy and killing my friend;
1827,PART II,"He was hurt when we fell, as I thought at the first,"
1828,PART II,And I've forced him three miles with a blood-vessel burst.
1829,PART II,"And his game heart went on."" Here a rush close behind"
1830,PART II,Made him cast a glance back with despair in his mind.
1831,PART II,"It was Cimmeroon rushing, his lips twitcht apart,"
1832,PART II,"His eyes rolled back sightless, and death in his heart."
1833,PART II,"He reached to Right Royal, then fell, and was dead,"
1834,PART II,Nevermore to stretch reins with his beautiful head.
1835,PART II,
1836,PART II,"A gush of bright blood filled his mouth as he sank,"
1837,PART II,"And he reached out his hoofs to the heave of his flank,"
1838,PART II,"And Charles, leaning forward, made certain, and cried,"
1839,PART II,"""This is Cimmeroon's blood, blown in passing beside,"
1840,PART II,And Roy's going strangely was just that he felt
1841,PART II,"Death coming behind him, or blood that he smelt."""
1842,PART II,
1843,PART II,So Charles's heart lightened and Royal went steady
1844,PART II,"As a water bound seaward set free from an eddy,"
1845,PART II,As a water sucked downward to leap at a weir
1846,PART II,Sucked swifter and swifter till it shoot like a spear.
1847,PART II,
1848,PART II,"There, a mile on ahead, was the Stand like a cliff,"
1849,PART II,"Grey wood, packed with faces, under banners blown stiff,"
1850,PART II,"Where, in two minutes more, they would cheer for him--if--"
1851,PART II,If he came to those horses still twelve lengths ahead.
1852,PART II,"""O Royal, you do it, or kill me!"" he said."
1853,PART II,
1854,PART II,"They went at the hurdle as though it weren't there,"
1855,PART II,"White splinters of hurdle flew up in the air,"
1856,PART II,"And down, like a rabbit, went Syringa the mare;"
1857,PART II,"Her man somersaulted right under Gavotte,"
1858,PART II,And Syringa went on but her rider did not.
1859,PART II,
1860,PART II,"But the little Gavotte tucked her feet away clear,"
1861,PART II,"Just an inch to one side of the fallen man's ear,"
1862,PART II,With a flash of horse wisdom as she went on the wing
1863,PART II,"Not to tread on man's body, that marvellous thing."
1864,PART II,
1865,PART II,As in mill-streams in summer the dark water drifts
1866,PART II,"Petals mown in the hayfield skimmed over by swifts,"
1867,PART II,"Petals blue from the speedwell or sweet from the lime,"
1868,PART II,"And the fish rise to test them, as they float, for a time,"
1869,PART II,"Yet they all loiter sluicewards and are whirled, and then drowned,"
1870,PART II,So the race swept the horses till they glimmered the ground.
1871,PART II,
1872,PART II,"Charles looked at those horses, and speedily guesst"
1873,PART II,"That the roan horse, Red Ember, was one of the best;"
1874,PART II,"He was level and easy, not turning a hair,"
1875,PART II,"But with power all ready when his rider should care,"
1876,PART II,And he leaped like a lover and his coat still did shine.
1877,PART II,"Charles thought, ""He's a wonder, and he's twelve lengths from mine."""
1878,PART II,
1879,PART II,"There were others still in it, according to looks:--"
1880,PART II,"Sir Lopez, and Soyland, and Peterkinooks,"
1881,PART II,"Counter Vair and Gavotte, all with plenty to spend;"
1882,PART II,"Then Monkery worn, and The Ghost at his end."
1883,PART II,"But the roan horse, Red Ember, seemed playing a game."
1884,PART II,"Charles thought, ""He's the winner; he can run us all tame."""
1885,PART II,"The wind brought a tune and a faint noise of cheers,"
1886,PART II,Right Royal coquetted and cocked up his ears.
1887,PART II,
1888,PART II,Charles saw his horse gaining; the going increased;
1889,PART II,"His touch on the mouth felt the soul of the beast,"
1890,PART II,And the heave of each muscle and the look of his eye
1891,PART II,"Said, ""I'll come to those horses, and pass them, or die."""
1892,PART II,
1893,PART II,"Like a thing in a dream the grey buildings drew nearer,"
1894,PART II,"The babble rose louder and the organ's whine clearer,"
1895,PART II,"The hurdle came closer, he rushed through its top"
1896,PART II,Like a comet in heaven that nothing can stop.
1897,PART II,
1898,PART II,"Then they strode the green grass for the Lost Lady's grave,"
1899,PART II,"And Charles felt Right Royal rise up like a wave,"
1900,PART II,Like a wave far to seaward that lifts in a line
1901,PART II,"And advances to shoreward in a slipping incline,"
1902,PART II,
1903,PART II,"And climbs, and comes toppling, and advances in glory,"
1904,PART II,"Mounting inwards, marching onwards, with his shoulders all hoary,"
1905,PART II,"Sweeping shorewards with a shouting to burst on the sand,"
1906,PART II,So Right Royal sent meaning through the rein in each hand.
1907,PART II,
1908,PART II,Charles felt like a captain whose ship has long chased
1909,PART II,"Some ship better handled, better manned, better placed,"
1910,PART II,"And has all day beheld her, that ship of his dream,"
1911,PART II,"Bowing swanlike beyond him up a blue hill of gleam,"
1912,PART II,"Yet, at dark, the wind rising makes his rival strike sail"
1913,PART II,While his own ship crowds canvas and comes within hail;
1914,PART II,"Till he see her, his rival, snouting into the grey,"
1915,PART II,"Like a sea-rock in winter that stands and breaks spray,"
1916,PART II,And by lamplight goes past her in a roaring of song
1917,PART II,"Shouting, ""Let fall your royals: stretch the halliards along!"""
1918,PART II,
1919,PART II,"Now The Ghost dropped behind him, now his horses drew close."
1920,PART II,"Charles watched them, in praying, while his hopes rose and rose,"
1921,PART II,"""O God, give me patience, give me luck, give me skill,"
1922,PART II,"For he's going so grandly I think that he will."""
1923,PART II,
1924,PART II,"They went at Lost Lady's like Severn at flood,"
1925,PART II,With an urging of horses and a squelching of mud;
1926,PART II,"By the hot flanks of horses the toppings were bruised,"
1927,PART II,And Syringa the manless swerved right and refused.
1928,PART II,
1929,PART II,"Swerved right on a sudden, as none could expect,"
1930,PART II,"Straight into Right Royal, who slithered and pecked,"
1931,PART II,"Though Charles held him up and got safely across,"
1932,PART II,He was round his nag's neck within touch of a toss.
1933,PART II,
1934,PART II,"He gat to his saddle, he never knew how;"
1935,PART II,"What hope he had had was knocked out of him now,"
1936,PART II,"But his courage came back as his terror declined,"
1937,PART II,He spoke to Right Royal and made up his mind.
1938,PART II,"He judged the lengths lost and the chance that remained,"
1939,PART II,"And he followed his field, and he gained, and he gained."
1940,PART II,
1941,PART II,"He watched them, those horses, so splendid, so swift,"
1942,PART II,Whirled down the green roadway like leaves in the lift:
1943,PART II,"Now he measured their mettle, and said with a moan,"
1944,PART II,"""They can beat me, Lord help me, though they give me a stone."
1945,PART II,"Red Ember's a wonder, and Soyland's the same,"
1946,PART II,"And Gavotte there's a beauty, and she goes like a flame;"
1947,PART II,"But Peterkinooks, that I used to despise,"
1948,PART II,"Is the horse that must win if his looks are not lies."""
1949,PART II,
1950,PART II,Their bright colours flitted as at dusk in Brazil
1951,PART II,"Bright birds reach the tree-tops when the land wind falls still,"
1952,PART II,When the sky is all scarlet on the tops of the treen
1953,PART II,"Comes a whirl of birds flying, blue and orange and green."
1954,PART II,
1955,PART II,"As a whirl of notes running in a fugue that men play,"
1956,PART II,"And the thundering follows as the pipe flits away,"
1957,PART II,"And the laughter comes after and the hautboys begin,"
1958,PART II,So they ran at the hurdle and scattered the whin.
1959,PART II,As they leaped to the race-course the sun burst from cloud
1960,PART II,And like tumult in dream came the roar of the crowd.
1961,PART II,
1962,PART II,"For to right and to left, now, were crowded men yelling,"
1963,PART II,"And a great cry boomed backward like muffled bells knelling,"
1964,PART II,"And a surge of men running seemed to follow the race,"
1965,PART II,The horses all trembled and quickened their pace.
1966,PART II,
1967,PART II,"As the porpoise, grown weary of his rush through the dim"
1968,PART II,"Of the unlitten silence where the swiftnesses swim,"
1969,PART II,Learns at sudden the tumult of a clipper bound home
1970,PART II,"And exults with this playmate and leaps in her foam,"
1971,PART II,
1972,PART II,"Or as nightingales coming into England in May,"
1973,PART II,"Coming songless at sunset, being worn with the way,"
1974,PART II,"Settle spent in the twilight, drooping head under wing,"
1975,PART II,"Yet are glad when the dark comes, while at moonrise they sing;"
1976,PART II,
1977,PART II,"Or as fire on a hillside, by happy boys kindled,"
1978,PART II,"That has burnt black a heath-tuft, scorcht a bramble, and dwindled,"
1979,PART II,"Blown by wind yet arises in a wave of flogged flame,"
1980,PART II,So the souls of those horses to the testing time came.
1981,PART II,
1982,PART II,"Now they closed on their leaders, and the running increased,"
1983,PART II,They rushed down the arc curving round to the east;
1984,PART II,"All the air rang with roaring, all the peopled loud stands"
1985,PART II,"Roared aloud from tense faces, shook with hats and waved hands."
1986,PART II,
1987,PART II,"So they cleared the green gorse-bush by bursting it through,"
1988,PART II,"There was no time for thinking, there was scarce time to do."
1989,PART II,Charles gritted his spirit as he charged through the gorse:
1990,PART II,"""You must just grin and suffer: sit still on your horse."""
1991,PART II,
1992,PART II,"There in front was a hurdle and the Distance Post white,"
1993,PART II,"And the long, green, broad Straight washed with wind and blown bright;"
1994,PART II,"Now the roaring had screaming, bringing names to their ears:"
1995,PART II,"""Come, Soyland!"" ""Sir Lopez!"" Then catcalls; then cheers."
1996,PART II,
1997,PART II,"""Sir Lopez! Sir Lopez!"" then the jigging brass laughter"
1998,PART II,From the yellow tost swing-boats swooping rafter to rafter.
1999,PART II,"Then the blare of all organs, then the roar of all throats,"
2000,PART II,"And they shot past the side shows, the horses and boats."
2001,PART II,
2002,PART II,Now the Wants of the Watchers whirled into the race
2003,PART II,"Like flames in their fury, like men in the face,"
2004,PART II,"Mad-red from the Wanting that made them alive,"
2005,PART II,They fought with those horses or helped them to strive.
2006,PART II,
2007,PART II,"Like leaves blown on Hudson when maples  turn gold,"
2008,PART II,"They whirled in their colour, they clutched to catch hold,"
2009,PART II,"They sang to the riders, they smote at their hearts"
2010,PART II,"Like flakes of live fire, like castings of  darts."
2011,PART II,
2012,PART II,"As a snow in Wisconsin when the darkness comes down,"
2013,PART II,"Running white on the prairie, making all the air brown,"
2014,PART II,"Blinding men with the hurry of its millions of feet,"
2015,PART II,"So the Wants pelted on them, so they blinded and beat."
2016,PART II,
2017,PART II,"And like spirits calm shining upon horses of flame,"
2018,PART II,"Came the Friends of those riders to shield them from shame,"
2019,PART II,"White as fire white-burning, rushing each by his friend,"
2020,PART II,Singing songs of the glory of the world without end;
2021,PART II,
2022,PART II,And as men in Wisconsin driving cars in the snow
2023,PART II,"Butt against its impulsion and face to the blow,"
2024,PART II,"Tossing snow from their bonnets as a ship tosses foam,"
2025,PART II,So the Friends tossed the Wantings as they brought their friends home.
2026,PART II,
2027,PART II,"Now they charged the last hurdle that led to the Straight,"
2028,PART II,"Charles longing to ride, though his spirit said ""Wait."""
2029,PART II,"He came to his horses as they came to the leap,"
2030,PART II,"Eight hard-driven horses, eight men breathing deep."
2031,PART II,
2032,PART II,"On the left, as he leaped it, a flashing of brown"
2033,PART II,"Kicking white on the grass, showed that Thankful was down;"
2034,PART II,"Then a glance right and left showed, that barring all flukes,"
2035,PART II,"It was Soyland's, Sir Lopez', or Peterkinooks'."
2036,PART II,
2037,PART II,"For Stormalong blundered and dwelt as he landed,"
2038,PART II,Counter Vair's man was beaten and Monkery stranded.
2039,PART II,As he reached to Red Ember the man on the red
2040,PART II,"Cried, ""Lord, Charlie Cothill, I thought you were dead!"""
2041,PART II,
2042,PART II,"He passed the Red Ember, he came to the flank"
2043,PART II,"Of Peterkinooks, whom he reached and then sank."
2044,PART II,"There were only two others, going level alone,"
2045,PART II,"First the spotted cream jacket, then the blue, white and roan."
2046,PART II,
2047,PART II,"Up the street of green race-course they strained for the prize,"
2048,PART II,While the stands blurred with waving and the air shook with cries:
2049,PART II,"""Now, Sir Lopez!"" ""Come, Soyland!"" ""Now, Sir Lopez! Now, now!"""
2050,PART II,"Then Charles judged his second, but he could not tell how."
2051,PART II,
2052,PART II,"But a glory of sureness leaped from horse into man,"
2053,PART II,"And the man said, ""Now, beauty,"" and the horse said, ""I can."""
2054,PART II,"And the long weary Royal made an effort the more,"
2055,PART II,Though his heart thumped like drum-beats as he went to the fore.
2056,PART II,
2057,PART II,"Neck and neck went Sir Lopez and Soyland together,"
2058,PART II,"Soyland first, a short head, with his neck all in lather;"
2059,PART II,"Both were ridden their hardest, both were doing their best,"
2060,PART II,Right Royal reached Soyland and came to his chest.
2061,PART II,
2062,PART II,"There Soyland's man saw him with the heel of his eye,"
2063,PART II,A horse with an effort that could beat him or tie;
2064,PART II,"Then he glanced at Sir Lopez, and he bit through his lip,"
2065,PART II,And he drove in his spurs and he took up his whip.
2066,PART II,
2067,PART II,"There he lashed the game Soyland who had given his all,"
2068,PART II,"And he gave three strides more, and then failed at the call,"
2069,PART II,And he dropped behind Royal like a leaf in a tide:
2070,PART II,Then Sir Lopez and Royal ran on side by side.
2071,PART II,
2072,PART II,"There they looked at each other, and they rode, and were grim;"
2073,PART II,"Charles thought, ""That's Sir Lopez. I shall never beat him."""
2074,PART II,"All the yells for Sir Lopez seemed to darken the air,"
2075,PART II,They were rushing past Emmy and the White Post was there.
2076,PART II,
2077,PART II,He drew to Sir Lopez; but Sir Lopez drew clear;
2078,PART II,Right Royal clung to him and crept to his ear.
2079,PART II,Then the man on Sir Lopez judged the moment had come
2080,PART II,For the last ounce of effort that would bring his horse home.
2081,PART II,
2082,PART II,"So he picked up his whip for three swift slashing blows,"
2083,PART II,"And Sir Lopez drew clear, but Right Royal stuck close."
2084,PART II,"Charles sat still as stone, for he dared not to stir--"
2085,PART II,There was that in Right Royal that needed no spur.
2086,PART II,
2087,PART II,"In the trembling of an instant power leaped up within,"
2088,PART II,Royal's pride of high spirit not to let the bay win.
2089,PART II,"Up he went, past his withers, past his neck, to his head,"
2090,PART II,"With Sir Lopez' man lashing, Charles still, seeing red."
2091,PART II,
2092,PART II,"So they rushed for one second, then Sir Lopez shot out:"
2093,PART II,"Charles thought, ""There, he's done me, without any doubt."
2094,PART II,"O come now, Right Royal!"""
2095,PART II,And Sir Lopez changed feet
2096,PART II,And his ears went back level; Sir Lopez was beat.
2097,PART II,
2098,PART II,"Right Royal went past him, half an inch, half a head,"
2099,PART II,"Half a neck, he was leading, for an instant he led;"
2100,PART II,"Then a hooped black and coral flew up like a shot,"
2101,PART II,With a lightning-like effort from little Gavotte.
2102,PART II,
2103,PART II,"The little bright mare, made of nerves and steel springs,"
2104,PART II,"Shot level beside him, shot ahead as with wings."
2105,PART II,"Charles felt his horse quicken, felt the desperate beat"
2106,PART II,Of the blood in his body from his knees to his feet.
2107,PART II,
2108,PART II,"Three terrible strides brought him up to the mare,"
2109,PART II,Then they rushed to wild shouting through a whirl of blown air;
2110,PART II,Then Gavotte died to nothing; Soyland came once again
2111,PART II,Till his muzzle just reached to the knot on his rein.
2112,PART II,
2113,PART II,"Then a whirl of urged horses thundered up, whipped and blown,"
2114,PART II,"Soyland, Peterkinooks, and Red Ember the roan."
2115,PART II,"For an instant they challenged, then they drooped and were done;"
2116,PART II,"Then the White Post shot backwards, Right Royal had won."
2117,PART II,
2118,PART II,"Won a half length from Soyland, Red Ember close third;"
2119,PART II,"Fourth, Peterkinooks; fifth, Gavotte harshly spurred;"
2120,PART II,"Sixth, Sir Lopez, whose rider said ""Just at the Straight"
2121,PART II,"He swerved at the hurdle and twisted a plate."""
2122,PART II,
2123,PART II,Then the numbers went up; then John Harding appeared
2124,PART II,To lead in the Winner while the bookmakers cheered.
2125,PART II,"Then the riders weighed-in, and the meeting was over,"
2126,PART II,And bright Emmy Crowthorne could go with her lover.
2127,PART II,
2128,PART II,For the bets on Right Royal which Cothill had made
2129,PART II,"The taker defaulted, they never were paid;"
2130,PART II,"The taker went West, whence he sent Charles's bride"
2131,PART II,Silver bit-cups and beadwork on antelope hide.
2132,PART II,
2133,PART II,"Charles married his lady, but he rode no more races;"
2134,PART II,"He lives on the Downland on the blown grassy places,"
2135,PART II,Where he and Right Royal can canter for hours
2136,PART II,On the flock bitten turf full of tiny blue flowers.
2137,PART II,
2138,PART II,"There the Roman pitcht camp, there the Saxon kept sheep,"
2139,PART II,"There he lives out this Living that no man can keep,"
2140,PART II,"That is manful but a moment before it must pass,"
2141,PART II,"Like the stars sweeping westward, like the wind on the grass."
