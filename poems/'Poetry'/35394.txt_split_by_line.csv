63,"MY DEAR LYALL,","even in the most accredited organs of opinion, principles of literary"
64,"MY DEAR LYALL,","criticism, either explicitly stated or tacitly assumed, are often utterly"

70,"MY DEAR LYALL,","they be deemed sound or otherwise, they are at least coherent; the canons"
71,"MY DEAR LYALL,",of criticism underlying them being that no verse which is unmusical or
72,"MY DEAR LYALL,","obscure can be regarded as Poetry, whatever other qualities it may"
73,"MY DEAR LYALL,","possess; that Imagination in Poetry, as distinguished from mere Fancy, is"
74,"MY DEAR LYALL,","the transfiguring of the Real, or actual, into the Ideal, by what Prospero"

123,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
124,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
125,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,The decay of authority is one of the most marked features of our time.
126,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Religion, politics, art, manners, speech, even morality, considered in its"
127,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"widest sense, have all felt the waning of traditional authority, and the"
128,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"substitution for it of individual opinion and taste, and of the wavering"
129,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,and contradictory utterances of publications ostensibly occupied with
130,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,criticism and supposed to be pronouncing serious judgments. By authority I
131,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"do not mean the delivery of dogmatic decisions, analogous to those issued"
132,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"by a legal tribunal from which there is no appeal, that have to be"
133,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"accepted and obeyed, but the existence of a body of opinion of long"
134,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"standing, arrived at after due investigation and experience during many"
135,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"generations, and reposing on fixed principles or fundamentals of thought."
136,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"This it is that is being dethroned in our day, and is being supplanted by"
137,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"a babel of clashing, irreconcilable utterances, often proceeding from the"
138,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"same quarters, even the same mouths."
139,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
140,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,In no department of thought has this been more conspicuous than in that of
141,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"literature, especially the higher class of literature; and it is most"
142,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,patent in the prevailing estimate of that branch of literature to which
143,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"lip-homage is still paid as the highest of all, viz. poetry. Chaucer,"
144,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, have not been openly dethroned; but it would"
145,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,require some boldness to deny that even their due recognition has been
146,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"indirectly questioned by a considerable amount of neglect, as compared"
147,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,with the interest shown alike by readers and reviewers in poets and poetry
148,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"of lesser stature. Are we to conclude from this that there is no standard,"
149,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,that there exist no permanent canons by which the relative greatness of
150,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,poets and poetry can be estimated with reasonable conclusiveness? It is
151,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,the purpose of this essay to show that such there are.
152,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
153,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"The expression of individual opinion upon a subject so wide, no matter who"
154,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"the individual might be, would obviously be worthless; and I have no wish"
155,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"to do what has been done too often in our time, to substitute personal"
156,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"taste or bias for canons of criticism that have stood the test of time,"
157,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"and whereon the relative position of poets, great, less great, and"
158,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"comparatively inferior, has reposed. The inductive method was employed"
159,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,long before it was explicitly proclaimed as distinct from and more
160,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"trustworthy than the merely deductive; and it is such method that will, if"
161,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"indirectly, be employed in this paper. Finally, I shall carefully abstain"
162,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,from the rhetorical enthusiasm or invective that clouds the judgment of
163,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"writers and readers alike, and invariably degenerates into personal"
164,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"dogmatism, together with intolerance of those who think otherwise. After"
165,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"indicating, to the best of my ability, the laws of thought and the canons"
166,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"of criticism on which should repose the estimate of the poetic hierarchy,"
167,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,I will then ask the reader to observe if the conclusions leave the
168,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"recognised Masters of Song--Homer, Æschylus, Euripides, Sophocles, Virgil,"
169,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Lucretius, Dante, Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, Byron--unassailed"
170,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,and unshaken in their poetic supremacy.
171,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
172,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"There must perforce be certain qualities common to all poetry, whether the"
173,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"greatest, the less great, or the comparatively inferior, and whether"
174,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"descriptive, lyrical, idyllic, reflective, epic, or dramatic; and, so long"
175,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,as there existed any authority or body of generally accepted opinion on
176,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"the subject, these were at least two such qualities, viz. melodiousness,"
177,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"whether sweet or sonorous, and lucidity or clearness of expression, to be"
178,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"apprehended, without laborious investigation, by highly cultured and"
179,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"simple readers alike. Melodiousness is a quality so essential to, and so"
180,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"inseparable from, all verse that is poetry, that it often, by its mere"
181,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"presence, endows with the character of poetry verse of a very rudimentary"
182,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"kind, verse that just crosses the border between prosaic and poetic verse,"
183,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,and would otherwise be denied admission to the territory of the Muses.
184,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Some of the enthusiasts to whom allusion has been made have, I am assured,"
185,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"declared of certain compositions of our time, ""This would be poetry, even"
186,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"if it meant nothing at all""--a dictum calculated, like others enunciated"
187,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"in our days, to harden the plain man in his disdain of poetry altogether."
188,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,It would not be difficult to quote melodious verse published in our time
189,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,of which it is no exaggeration to say that the words in it are used rather
190,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,as musical notes than as words signifying anything. In all likelihood such
191,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"compositions, and the widespread liking for them, arise partly from the"
192,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"prevailing preference for music over the other arts, and in part from the"
193,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,mental indolence that usually accompanies emotion in all but the highest
194,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"minds. Nevertheless it cannot be too much insisted on that music, or"
195,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"melodiousness, either sweet or sonorous, is absolutely indispensable to"
196,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"poetry; and where it is absent, poetry is absent, even though thought and"
197,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,wide speculation be conspicuous in it. As Horace put it long ago in his
198,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"_Art of Poetry_,"
199,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
200,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Non satis est pulchra esse poemata: dulcia sunto.
201,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
202,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Almost as essential to poetry, and equally as regards poetry of the"
203,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"loftiest and poetry of the lowliest kind, is lucidity, or clearness of"
204,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"expression. No poet of much account is ever obscure, unless the text"
205,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"happens to be corrupt. When essays and even volumes are issued, since"
206,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"deemed indispensable for the understanding of a writer labelled as a poet,"
207,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"one may be quite sure that, however deep a thinker, he is not a poet of"
208,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"the first order, and not a poet at all in the passages that require such"
209,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,explanation. When one hears a well-authenticated story to the effect that
210,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"a great scholar said of an English paraphrase of a well-known Greek poem,"
211,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,that he thought he had succeeded in gathering its meaning with the help of
212,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"the original, one ought to know what to think of the work. Yet, though"
213,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"much of its author's verse is of that non-lucid character, it is"
214,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"habitually saluted by many critics as great poetry. With all respect, I"
215,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,venture to affirm that in such circumstances the designation must be a
216,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"misnomer. I remember a poem being read to me, in perfect good faith, by"
217,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"its author, a man of great mental distinction and no little imagination,"
218,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"of which, though I listened with the closest attention, not only did I not"
219,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"understand one word, but I had not the faintest idea, as the colloquial"
220,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"phrase is, what it was about. When it was published, I asked three ardent"
221,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,admirers of the author to explain to me its meaning. They failed entirely
222,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"to do so. The saying, concerning the orator, _clarescit urendo_, is even"
223,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"yet more applicable to the poet. He brightens as he burns. Yet, of recent"
224,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"times, verse fuliginous, clouded, and enshrouded in obscurity, has been"
225,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"hailed in many quarters, not only as poetry, but poetry of an"
226,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,exceptionally superior sort.
227,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
228,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"If it be urged that Dante, and even Shakespeare, do not always yield up"
229,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"their meaning to the reader at once, the allegation must be traversed"
230,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,absolutely. The immediate apprehension of the meaning of the _Vita Nuova_
231,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,and the _Divina Commedia_ presupposes an intimate acquaintance with the
232,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"various dialects of the Italian language existing in Dante's time, and"
233,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"likewise with the erudition he scatters so profusely, if allusively,"
234,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"throughout his verse. But to the Italian readers of Dante, even"
235,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"superficially acquainted with those dialects, and adequate masters of the"
236,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"theology and the astronomy of Dante's time, those poems present no"
237,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"difficulty. Of Shakespeare, the greatest of all the poets in our language,"
238,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,let it be granted that he is not unoften one of the most careless and even
239,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"most slovenly; but rarely is he so to the obscuring of his meaning, and"
240,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"never save casually, and in some brief passage. Yet let it not be inferred"
241,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,that I am of opinion that the full meaning of the greatest passages in the
242,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"greatest poems is to be seized all at once, or by the average reader at"
243,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"all. That is ""deeper than ever plummet sounded,"" though Tennyson's"
244,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"""indolent reviewer"" apparently imagines that he at once fathoms the more"
245,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"intellectual poetry of his time. There can be but few readers, and"
246,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"possibly none but poets themselves, or persons who, to quote Tennyson"
247,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"again, ""have the great poetic heart,"" who master the full significance of"
248,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,_Hamlet_ or of the tersely told story of Francesca da Rimini. But the
249,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"whole world at once understood the more obvious tenor of both, and is not"
250,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"puzzled by either. There is a sliding scale of understanding, as there is"
251,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"a sliding scale of inspiration. ""We needs must love the highest when we"
252,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"see it""; but ""when we see it"" is an important qualification in the"
253,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,statement.
254,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
255,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"I do not know that there are any qualities save melodiousness, sweet or"
256,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"sonorous, and lucidity, that are absolutely essential to whatever is to be"
257,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"regarded as poetry. In order to preclude misapprehension, let it be added"
258,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"that, while both are essential to poetry, they will not, by themselves, go"
259,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,far towards endowing verse with the poetic character. As an example of
260,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"this, let me cite verse which is not unmelodious, though not specially"
261,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"remarkable for melodiousness, and not obscure, yet is not poetry, and"
262,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,hardly on the border of it:
263,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
264,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,I have a boy of five years old;
265,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,His face is fair and fresh to see;
266,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"His limbs are cast in beauty's mould,"
267,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,And dearly he loves me.
268,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
269,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"One morn we strolled on our dry walk,"
270,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Our quiet home all full in view,"
271,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,And held such intermitted talk
272,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,As we are wont to do.
273,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
274,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,My thoughts on former pleasures ran;
275,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"I thought of Kilve's delightful shore,"
276,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Our pleasant home when spring began,"
277,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"A long, long year before."
278,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
279,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,A day it was when I could bear
280,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Some fond regrets to entertain;
281,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"With so much happiness to spare,"
282,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,I could not feel a pain.
283,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
284,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"This blameless, correct, harmonious, and thoroughly lucid verse is by a"
285,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"poet who has written poetry of the noblest quality, no less a poet than"
286,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Wordsworth. Yet he sorely tries his readers by page after page no more
287,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"poetical than the foregoing; and he offered, on the first appearance of"
288,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"every volume of his, ample matter for such critics as would rather be"
289,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"sweepingly censorious than discriminating, to depreciate and even to"
290,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"ridicule him. His reverent admirers, who comprise all true lovers of"
291,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"poetry, are acquainted with, and probably possess, a copy of Matthew"
292,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Arnold's Selection, entitled _Poems of Wordsworth_--a small volume which"
293,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"that gifted Wordsworthian, who knew and acknowledged with his usual sense"
294,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"of humour how many unpoetical ""sermons,"" as he called them, Wordsworth had"
295,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"written, deliberately considered to contain all the real poetry he has"
296,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"left us. If I may refer for a moment to my own copy of it, this is scored"
297,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"with brief observations in pencil, the upshot of which is that the small"
298,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"fraction of his work, which Matthew Arnold too liberally wished to be"
299,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"regarded as _digna Phoebi_, would have again to be materially reduced by"
300,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,a dispassionate criticism.
301,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
302,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"The most generous critic, if he is to be discriminating and just, cannot,"
303,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"let me say again, allow that any verse which is profoundly obscure or"
304,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"utterly unmusical, no matter how intellectual in substance, deserves the"
305,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"appellation of poetry. But on a very thin thread of meaning poetry, or a"
306,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"very fair imitation of it, may be hung by the aid of musical sound."
307,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Without going so far as Arnold again, who once wrote to me that Shelley's"
308,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"""My soul is an enchanted boat"" seemed to him ""mere musical verbiage,"" that"
309,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"poem might serve as an instance of verse which, in spite of tenuity of"
310,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"meaning, becomes poetry by sheer magic of exquisite music."
311,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
312,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"My soul is an enchanted boat,"
313,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Which, like a sleeping swan, doth float"
314,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Upon the silver waves of thy sweet singing;
315,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,And thine doth like an angel sit
316,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Beside a helm conducting it,"
317,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Whilst all the winds with melody are ringing
318,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"It seems to float ever, for ever,"
319,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Upon that many-winding river,"
320,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Between mountains, woods, abysses."
321,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,A paradise of wildernesses!
322,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Till, like one in slumber bound,"
323,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Borne to the ocean, I float down, around,"
324,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Into a sea profound of ever-spreading sound.
325,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
326,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,There is a magic of sound in the verse so enchanting to a reader that he
327,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,may be pardoned for failing to observe at once that it is mainly musical
328,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,fancy. Many may remember a line of Tennyson:
329,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
330,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Like a tale of little meaning, though the words are strong."
331,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
332,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"And are we not compelled to feel, on second thoughts, if we have any"
333,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"capacity for discrimination, that here we have poetry of little meaning,"
334,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"though the verse is exquisitely melodious? This is, I conclude, what"
335,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Arnold meant when he designated it, with a little exaggeration, ""musical"
336,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"verbiage."""
337,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
338,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,I have been obliged to linger somewhat on the threshold of my subject in
339,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,order to emphasise the essential importance and inseparable quality of
340,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"metrical melodiousness and lucidity in poetry, in order that, in whatever"
341,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"follows in this paper, these indispensable conditions may not be lost"
342,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,sight of; and also because of late each of them has been ousted from
343,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"consideration by those who have striven, and still strive, to induce"
344,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"literary opinion to accept not only as poetry, but as great poetry, what"
345,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"is conspicuously lacking in both. That I shall have the assent, however,"
346,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"of the weight of authority on this point, and likewise that of the"
347,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"ordinary unaffected lover of poetry, I can scarcely doubt; the more so, as"
348,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,the conclusions thus far reached leave undisturbed upon their seats those
349,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"mighty ones, of all tongues and all nations, whose universally recognised"
350,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,greatness has received the seal and sanction of many generations.
351,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
352,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,What may be called the first principles of poetry having thus been
353,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"propounded, without any necessity for reaffirming them in the"
354,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"investigation of other conclusions yet to be reached, I may move on to"
355,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,what I imagine will be less familiar and perhaps more original in the
356,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"search for ""The Essentials of Great Poetry."" If we carefully observe the"
357,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"gradual development of mental power in human beings, irrespectively of any"
358,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"reference to poetry, but as applied to general objects of human interest,"
359,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,we shall find that the advance from elementary to supreme expansion of
360,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"mental power is in the following order of succession, each preceding"
361,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,element in mental development being retained on the appearance of its
362,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"successor: (1) Perception, vague at first, as in the newly born, gradually"
363,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"becoming more definite, along with desires of an analogous kind; (2)"
364,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Sentiment, also vague at first, but by degrees becoming more definite,"
365,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,until it attaches itself to one or more objects exclusively; (3) Thought
366,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"or Reflection, somewhat hazy in its inception, and often remaining in that"
367,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"condition to the last; (4) Action, which is attended and assisted by the"
368,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"three preceding qualities of Perception, Sentiment, and Thought or"
369,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Reflection. In other words, human beings perceive before they feel,"
370,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"perceive and feel before they think, perceive, feel, and think before they"
371,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"act, or at least before they act reasonably, though it may be but"
372,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"imperfectly, and though the later or higher stages may in many cases"
373,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,scarcely be reached at all.
374,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
375,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Now let us see if, in poetry, the same order or succession in development"
376,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,and expansion does not exist. Never forgetting the essential qualities of
377,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"melody and lucidity, do we not find that mere descriptive verse, which"
378,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"depends on perception or observation, is the humblest and most elementary"
379,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"form of poetry; that descriptive verse, when suffused with sentiment,"
380,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"gains in value and charm; that if, to the foregoing, thought or reflection"
381,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"be superadded, there is a conspicuous rise in dignity, majesty, and"
382,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"relative excellence; and finally, that the employment of these in"
383,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"narrative action, whether epic or dramatic, carries us on to a stage of"
384,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,supreme excellence which can rarely be predicated of any poetry in which
385,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"action is absent? If this be so, we have to the successive development of"
386,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"observation, feeling, thought, and action, an exact analogy or counterpart"
387,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,in (1) Descriptive Poetry; (2) Lyrical Poetry; (3) Reflective Poetry; (4)
388,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Epic or Dramatic Poetry; in each of which, melody and lucidity being"
389,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"always present, there is an advance in poetic value over the preceding"
390,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"stage, without the preceding one being eliminated from its progress."
391,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
392,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Once again let us have recourse to illustration, which, when fairly"
393,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"chosen, is probably the most effective method for securing assent."
394,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Wordsworth presents us with an ample supply of illustrations in three out
395,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,of the four different kinds of poetry; and therefore to him let us have
396,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"recourse. In reading the first stanza of _The Pet Lamb_, and two or three"
397,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"stanzas that follow, we have descriptive verse which may be regarded as"
398,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"very elementary poetry, but to which it would seem to many to be"
399,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,hypercritical to refuse that designation. It is too well known to need
400,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,citation. The opening lines of _The Leech-Gatherer_ display the same
401,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,elementary descriptive character.
402,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
403,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,There was a roaring in the wind all night;
404,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,The rain came heavily and fell in floods;
405,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,But now the sun is rising calm and bright;
406,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,The birds are singing in the distant woods;
407,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Over his own sweet voice the Stock-dove broods;
408,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,The Jay makes answer as the Magpie chatters;
409,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,And all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters.
410,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
411,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,All things that love the Sun are out of doors;
412,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,The sky rejoices in the morning's birth;
413,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,The grass is bright with rain-drops; on the moors
414,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,The Hare is running races in her mirth;
415,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,And with her feet she from the plashy earth
416,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Raises a mist, that, glittering in the sun,"
417,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Runs with her all the way, wherever she doth run."
418,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
419,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,I was a traveller then upon the moor;
420,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,I saw the Hare that raced about with joy;
421,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,I heard the woods and distant waters roar;
422,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Or heard them not, as happy as a boy:"
423,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,The pleasant season did my heart employ;
424,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"My old remembrances went from me wholly,"
425,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"And all the ways of men, so vain and melancholy."
426,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
427,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"I perceive that, in my copy of the volume of Selections made by Matthew"
428,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Arnold from the poems of Wordsworth, already alluded to, I have written at"
429,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"the end of _Margaret_, ""If this be poetry, surely many people may say they"
430,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"have written poetry all their lives without knowing it."" But as Matthew"
431,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Arnold's critical opinions will carry more weight than mine, and he has"
432,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"included _Margaret_ in his Selection, let me quote a dozen lines or so"
433,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,from its opening passage:
434,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
435,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"'Twas Summer, and the Sun had mounted high:"
436,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Southward the landscape indistinctly glared
437,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Through a pale steam; but all the northern downs,"
438,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"In clearest air ascending, showed far off"
439,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,A surface dappled o'er with shadows flung
440,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,From brooding clouds; shadows that lay in spots
441,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Determined and unmoved, with steady beams"
442,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Of bright and pleasant sunshine interposed;
443,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Pleasant to him who on the soft cool moss
444,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Extends his careless limbs along the front
445,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Of some huge cave, whose rocky ceiling casts"
446,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"A twilight of its own, an ample shade,"
447,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Where the Wren warbles.
448,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
449,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"But there is, it must not be overlooked, merely Descriptive Poetry of a"
450,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"much higher kind than the foregoing, though Wordsworth may not be the best"
451,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,source from which to draw it. Perhaps its highest possibilities are to be
452,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"found in Byron, and conspicuously in the third and fourth cantos of"
453,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,_Childe Harold_. Many of the passages of the kind that one remembers there
454,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"are, however, either too much suffused with the poet's personal feeling,"
455,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,or too closely connected with great incidents in history and the fall of
456,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"empires, to be quite pertinent examples. A minor but sufficient example"
457,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,taken from _Childe Harold_ may suffice for illustration:
458,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
459,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"It is the hush of night, and all between"
460,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Thy margin and the mountains, dusk, yet clear,"
461,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Mellow'd and mingling, yet distinctly seen,"
462,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Save darken'd Jura, whose capt heights appear"
463,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Precipitously steep; and drawing near,"
464,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"There breathes a living fragrance from the shore,"
465,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Of flowers yet fresh with childhood; on the ear
466,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Drops the light drip of the suspended oar,"
467,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Or chirps the grasshopper one good-night carol more.
468,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
469,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Far finer instances of poetry essentially descriptive in the same poem may
470,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"be referred to, _e.g._ Canto IV., stanza xcix., beginning ""There is a"
471,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"stern round tower of other days""; stanza cvii., beginning with ""Cypress"
472,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"and ivy, weed and wallflower grown""; stanza clxxiii., descriptive of Lake"
473,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Nemi; and even--for it also is strictly descriptive--stanza cxl., opening"
474,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"with the well-known line ""I see before me the gladiator lie."""
475,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
476,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"It could not be allowed that any of these, considered separately,"
477,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"satisfies the conditions or essentials of great poetry, though, in company"
478,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"with others, they contribute to that character in a very great poem"
479,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"indeed. Moreover, they serve to show that even mere Descriptive Poetry,"
480,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"which I have spoken of as the ""lowest"" or most elementary kind of poetry,"
481,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"may rise to striking elevation of merit, and has its counterpart in the"
482,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,sliding scale of observation in various individuals.
483,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
484,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Let us now take a step, and a long one, in the scale of importance"
485,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"attained by the various kinds of poetry, and consider the classics of"
486,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Lyrical Poetry. Here extensive quotation will be less necessary, partly by"
487,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"reason of the wide ground Lyrical Poetry covers, and partly because of its"
488,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"relative popularity in our time, and the familiarity of so many readers"
489,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,with its most enchanting specimens. There is ample room for personal taste
490,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,and individual idiosyncrasy within the vast boundaries of this fruitful
491,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,field. Many persons are sadly wanting in observation; and to only a
492,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"minority can real, serious thought be ascribed. But we all feel, we all"
493,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,have visitations of sentiment; and therefore to all of us is Lyrical
494,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Poetry more or less welcome.
495,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
496,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"The causes, personal and social, that have given to Lyrical Poetry in our"
497,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,time almost exclusive favour in public taste will be dealt with presently.
498,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,It will distract less from our main purpose to confine ourselves for the
499,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"present to the recognition of the fact, and to seek to show how very"
500,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,various are the degrees of eminence in Lyrical Poetry. The lyrical note is
501,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,so natural to poets and poetry that we may expect to find it in the verse
502,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"of all poets, though in a minor degree in didactic verse; while in some"
503,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,poets it almost monopolises their utterance. Though perhaps not obvious to
504,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"many ears to-day, it lurks in no little of Pope's _Epistle of Eloisa to"
505,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Abelard_, and is unmistakably present in his _Ode on St. Cecilia's Day_."
506,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"If I am asked if the lyrical note is to be found in Chaucer, the reply"
507,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"must be that, though Chaucer has left nothing which the modern reader"
508,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"would recognise as lyrical, what is called his iambic or five-foot metre"
509,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,is far more anapæstic and lyrical than is the case with any subsequent
510,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"poet, except Shakespeare. There is a lilt in it equivalent to the lyrical"
511,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"note, which those who read as Chaucer wrote recognise at once. One has"
512,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,only to read the opening lines of the Prologue to the _Canterbury Tales_
513,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"to perceive this. Not quite to the same extent perhaps as in Chaucer, but"
514,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"withal very noticeably to the ear, the lyrical note is frequently to be"
515,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"caught in Spenser, even where he is not obviously offering the reader"
516,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Lyrical Poetry; as, for instance, in this stanza in the first canto of the"
517,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"_Fairy Queen_, beginning:"
518,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
519,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"A little lowly hermitage it was,"
520,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Down in a dale, hard by a forest's side."
521,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
522,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"This is not Lyrical Poetry proper, as now understood. But Spenser has left"
523,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,us in his _Epithalamion_ a lyrical poem with which only one other English
524,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,lyric can be placed in competition for the first place. It is too long for
525,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,more than one brief excerpt to be cited here:
526,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
527,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Wake now, my love, awake! for it is time;"
528,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"The rosy Morne long since left Tithones bed,"
529,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,All ready to her silver coche to clyme;
530,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,And Phoebus gins to shew his glorious hed.
531,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Hark! how the cheerefull birds do chaunt theyr laies
532,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,And carroll of loves praise.
533,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,The merry Larke hir mattins sings aloft;
534,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,The Thrush replyes; the Mavis descant playes;
535,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,The Ouzell shrills; the Ruddock warbles soft;
536,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"So goodly all agree, with sweet consent,"
537,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"To this dayes meriment,"
538,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Ah! my deere love, why doe ye sleepe thus long,"
539,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"When meeter were that ye should now awake,"
540,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"T' awayt the comming of your joyous make,"
541,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"And hearken to the birds love-learned song,"
542,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,The deawy leaves among?
543,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,For they of joy and pleasance to you sing
544,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"That all the woods them answer, and theyr eccho ring."
545,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
546,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"One is sorry to think that this long, lovely, and varied lyric is less"
547,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,known than it ought to be to the modern readers of Lyrical Poetry. I can
548,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"only say to them, ""Make haste to read it."""
549,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
550,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,In Shakespeare's plays the lyrical note is so often to be heard in the
551,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,blank verse that the poet's natural aptitude and inclination for singing
552,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,were amply exercised there; and he gives most voice to it in such plays as
553,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,_As You Like It_ and _Romeo and Juliet_. But it recurs again and again
554,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,throughout his dramas. Such lines as:
555,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
556,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"All over-canopied with lush woodbine,"
557,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
558,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank,"
559,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
560,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Under the shade of melancholy boughs,"
561,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
562,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,are illustrations of what I am pointing out.
563,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
564,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Without dwelling on the excellent lyrics written in the reigns of Charles
565,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"I. and Charles II., and confining ourselves to the _di majores_ of poetry,"
566,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"we may pass on to Milton, whose _Allegro_ and _Penseroso_ as likewise the"
567,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"lyrics in _Comus_, are too familiar to every one to be more than mentioned"
568,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"as evidence of the persistence, in the past as in the present, of the"
569,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,warbling impulse in all poets. Heard but fitfully during the greater part
570,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"of the eighteenth century, yet most arrestingly in Gray, Collins, and"
571,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Burns, Lyrical Poetry from the last onward without intermission, to our"
572,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"own time, in Scott, Byron, Wordsworth, Keats, Shelley, and Tennyson, is"
573,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"almost the only poetry that has in recent days been much listened to, or"
574,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,much written and talked about. This circumstance is far from being
575,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"conclusive as to whether, during the same period, poems higher and"
576,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,greater than mere Lyrical Poetry have or have not been produced. But it is
577,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"absolutely certain that, if produced, they have been, so far, more or less"
578,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"ignored; and that, if the same poets have written such and Lyrical Poetry"
579,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"as well, they will have been considered and estimated by the latter only."
580,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
581,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,But the domain of feeling and emotion in which Lyrical Poetry has room to
582,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,display its power and versatility is so extensive that lyrics are very
583,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"various in their themes and in the treatment of them. Love, religion,"
584,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"patriotism, cosmopolitan benevolence, being, as I have shown in _The Human"
585,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Tragedy_, the most elevated and most permanent sources of human sentiment"
586,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"and emotion, there will necessarily be in Lyrical Poetry, even considered"
587,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"by itself, and apart from all the other forms of poetry, a scale of"
588,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,relative elevation and importance.
589,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
590,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"The love of individuals for each other, whether domestic, romantic, or"
591,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"sexual, is much more common than any of the other three, being practically"
592,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,universal; and it has given birth to so many well-known lyrics that it is
593,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,unnecessary to cite any of them here. Some of them are very beautiful; but
594,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"none of them, by reason of the comparative narrowness of their theme,"
595,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"satisfies the essentials of great poetry. Not even Tennyson's _Maud_,"
596,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,which is perhaps the most ambitious and the best known of long poems
597,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"dedicated mainly to the subject, though it contains lovely passages,"
598,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,approaches greatness.
599,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
600,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Though what is understood as religious sentiment comes next to the love of
601,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"individuals for each other in the extent of its influence, it has produced"
602,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"much verse, but, it must be allowed, little poetry, the reason probably"
603,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,being that the religious sentiment of the few who are endowed with the
604,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"gift of writing poetry differs from that of the average ""religious"""
605,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,person. Nor can the fact be overlooked that there is a certain character
606,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,of reserve in Protestantism which has operated since the Reformation
607,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,against the growth of religious Lyrical Poetry. For that we must go either
608,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"to pre-Reformation days, or to the poetry of those who, like George"
609,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Herbert and the poetic kin of his time, clung to the Roman Catholic creed"
610,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,after the modification of belief and ritual in the Anglican Church; or to
611,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"the poets in our own time trained in the Roman Catholic faith, and to that"
612,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"extent, and on that ground, debarred from wide popularity among a"
613,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Protestant people. The De Veres, Faber, Coventry Patmore, and Newman, the"
614,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"last notably in his _Dream of Gerontius_, may be named as instances of"
615,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,what has been done in recent times in the sphere of religious poetry.
616,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Scott's lovely ""Ave Maria"" in _The Lady of the Lake_, and Byron's stanza"
617,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,beginning:
618,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
619,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Ave Maria! 'tis the hour of prayer,"
620,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
621,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"are briefer specimens of what may be, and has been contributed in later"
622,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,times to religious poetry; much smaller in bulk and volume than poetry
623,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"dedicated to the love of individuals for each other, but higher in the"
624,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"rising scale of greatness, because of the greater dignity of its theme."
625,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
626,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Patriotic Lyrical Poetry need not detain us long. Most patriotic verse,"
627,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"however spirited, is verse only, nothing or little more, though exceptions"
628,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"could be cited, such as Drayton's _Agincourt_, Tennyson's _Relief of"
629,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Lucknow_, and _The Ballad of the ""Revenge.""_ But if in patriotic Lyrical"
630,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Poetry we include, as I think we should, poetry in the English tongue, but"
631,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"not concerning England or the British Empire, I may name Byron's ""Isles"
632,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"of Greece"" in _Don Juan_, which I had in my mind when I observed that"
633,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,there is in our language only one lyrical poem that can compete for the
634,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,first place in Lyrical Poetry with Spenser's _Epithalamion_.
635,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
636,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"3. Reflective Poetry. Over Reflective Poetry, in itself a stage of advance"
637,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"beyond Descriptive Poetry and Lyrical Poetry in themselves, we need not"
638,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"linger long, for the reason that, though Reflective Poetry is ample in"
639,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"quantity, it is, outside the Drama, very limited in quality, most of it"
640,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,being of so prosaic a character as not only not to be ranked above average
641,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Lyrical Poetry, but far below it. Wordsworth furnishes us, for the purpose"
642,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"of illustration, with both kinds, the higher and the lower Reflective"
643,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Poetry. As regards the latter, I would rather let Matthew Arnold, than"
644,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"whom there is no warmer admirer of Wordsworth, be the spokesman:"
645,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
646,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,_The Excursion_ abounds with Philosophy [I prefer to call it Thought
647,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,or Reflection]; and therefore _The Excursion_ is to the Wordsworthian
648,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"what it never can be to the disinterested lover of poetry, a"
649,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"satisfactory work. ""Duty exists,"" says Wordsworth in _The Excursion_;"
650,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,and then he proceeds thus:
651,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
652,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"... Immutably survive,"
653,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"For our support, the measures and the forms"
654,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Which an abstract Intelligence supplies,"
655,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Whose kingdom is where time and space are not.
656,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
657,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"And the Wordsworthian is delighted, and thinks that here is a sweet"
658,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,union of philosophy and poetry. But the disinterested lover of poetry
659,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,will feel that the lines carry us really not a step farther than the
660,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,proposition which they would interpret; that they are a tissue of
661,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"elevated but abstract verbiage, alien to the very nature of poetry."
662,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
663,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Merely observing that I wholly agree with the foregoing estimate, I pass"
664,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"to the higher Reflective Poetry, of which Wordsworth has given us such"
665,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,splendid but comparatively brief instances. The _Lines composed a few
666,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"miles above Tintern Abbey_, _Elegiac Stanzas suggested by a Picture of"
667,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Peele Castle_, his best Sonnets, the _Character of the Happy Warrior_,"
668,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"the _Ode to Duty_, and, finally, the _Ode on Intimations of Immortality_"
669,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,seem to me to place Wordsworth above all other English Poets in the domain
670,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,of exclusively Reflective Poetry. I do not forget much noble Reflective
671,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Poetry in _Childe Harold_; but it is too much blent with other elements,"
672,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"and into it the active quality enters too strongly, for its more"
673,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"reflective features to be separated from them. Moreover, it generally"
674,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,falls far short of the intellectual note so strongly marked in
675,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Wordsworth's best Reflective Poetry, into which, be it added, both the"
676,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"descriptive and the lyrical notes, in accordance with the general law I am"
677,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"seeking to expound in this paper, enter very largely, if, of course,"
678,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"subordinately. It will be obvious, however, to any dispassionate lover of"
679,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"poetry, that a merely reflective poem of any great length cannot well be"
680,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"entitled to the designation of a great poem. Had such been possible,"
681,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Wordsworth would have bequeathed it to us. _The Excursion_ is the answer;
682,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"which, notwithstanding a certain number of fine passages, is, for the most"
683,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"part, what Matthew Arnold says of it, ""doctrine such as we hear in church,"
684,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,religious and philosophical doctrine; and the attached Wordsworthian loves
685,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"passages of such doctrine, and brings them forward as proofs of his poet's"
686,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"excellence."""
687,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
688,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"If the reader has followed me so far, with more or less assent, he will be"
689,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"prepared not only to allow, but of himself to feel, that there must be yet"
690,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"another kind or order of poetry, in which the greatest poems are to be"
691,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"found, poems that are neither exclusively nor mainly either descriptive,"
692,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"lyrical, or reflective, but into which all three elements enter"
693,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"subordinately, though none of them gives it its distinctive and supreme"
694,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,character.
695,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
696,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,4. Epic and Dramatic Poetry. That supreme kind of poetry is Epic and
697,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Dramatic Poetry, though there may be very poor Epics, and Dramas in which"
698,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"true poetry is scarcely to be observed, just as we have seen that there is"
699,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"very inferior Descriptive, Lyrical, and Reflective Poetry. All that is"
700,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,asserted is that great epic and dramatic poems must be greater than the
701,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,greatest poetry of the preceding kinds by reason of their wider range and
702,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"(as a rule) the higher majesty of their theme, and of their including"
703,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,every other kind of poetry.
704,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
705,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,It will perhaps have been noticed that Epic and Dramatic Poetry are here
706,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"placed in conjunction, not separately; and their being thus conjoined"
707,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,needs a word of explanation. Though there is a radical distinction between
708,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"the two, this provisional union of them has been adopted in order to"
709,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,afford an opportunity of pointing out what I think is generally
710,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"ignored--that poems which are essentially epical, or merely narrative, may"
711,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"be written in dialogue or dramatic form, and so mislead incautious readers"
712,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"into inferring that they are offered as dramas, in the acting sense of the"
713,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"term. It is because, while remaining substantially epical or narrative in"
714,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"character they may contain, here and there, dramatic situations, dramatic"
715,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"rhetoric, and dramatic converse. The _Iliad_ is a conspicuous example of"
716,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,this; the movement in the earlier portion of it being full of debate and
717,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"defiance among its characters, and these dramatic elements recurring, if"
718,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"less frequently, throughout the entire work. To many persons the episodes"
719,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"in the narrative of the _Divina Commedia_ that give rise to converse,"
720,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"whether tender, terrible, or pathetic, are the most delightful portions of"
721,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,it. What is it that makes the first six books of _Paradise Lost_ so much
722,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,more telling than the later ones? Surely it is the magnificence of the
723,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,speeches emanating from the mouths of the chief characters. _Childe
724,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Harold_ is ostensibly only descriptive, reflective, and narrative; but the"
725,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"personality and supposed wrongs of Byron himself, so frequently"
726,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"introduced, confer on it, beyond these characters, certain features of the"
727,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"drama and of dramatic action. Moreover, the magnificent ruins bequeathed"
728,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,to the seven-hilled city by the fall of the Roman Empire enter so largely
729,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"into the fourth canto that this includes in it every species of verse,"
730,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"from the descriptive to the dramatic. To cite a much smaller example, I"
731,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"once said to Tennyson, ""Do you not think that, had one met in a tragedy"
732,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,with the couplet from Pope (_Ep. to the Sat._ ii. 205)--
733,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
734,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,_F._ You're strangely proud ...
735,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
736,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"_P._ Yes, I am proud: I must be proud to see"
737,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Men not afraid of God, afraid of _me_"
738,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
739,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"--one would be right in regarding it as very fine, dramatically?"" and he"
740,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"replied, ""Yes, certainly."" I recall the circumstance because it is an"
741,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,extreme illustration of the momentary intrusion of one style into another.
742,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
743,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,By slow but successive stages we have reached conclusions that may be thus
744,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,briefly stated. (1) The essentials of great poetry are not to be found in
745,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,poetry exclusively descriptive. (2) They are rarely to be met with in
746,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"poetry that is lyrical, and then only when reflection of a high order, as"
747,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"in Wordsworth's _Intimations of Immortality_, or what is equivalent to"
748,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"action operating on a great theme, as in Byron's _Isles of Greece_,"
749,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,largely and conspicuously enters into these. (3) That they are to be met
750,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"with in Reflective Poetry of the very highest character, but never"
751,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,throughout an exclusively reflective poem of any length. (4) That they are
752,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,chiefly to be sought for and most frequently found in either epic or
753,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"dramatic poetry where description, emotion, thought, and action all"
754,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"co-operate to produce the result; that result being, to adduce supreme"
755,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"examples, the _Iliad_, _Paradise Lost_, the _Divina Commedia_, the third"
756,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"and fourth cantos of _Childe Harold_, _Hamlet_, _King Lear_, _Macbeth_."
757,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
758,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Many years ago, in a couple of papers published in the _Contemporary"
759,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Review_ on ""New and Old Canons of Poetic Criticism,"" I propounded, as the"
760,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"most satisfactory definition of poetry generally, that it is ""the"
761,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"transfiguration, in musical verse, of the Real into the Ideal""; and I have"
762,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,more than once advocated the definition. The definition applies to poetry
763,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"of all kinds. But, while this is so, the transfiguration must operate on a"
764,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"great theme greatly treated, either lyrically, reflectively, epically, or"
765,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"dramatically, in order to produce great poetry."
766,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
767,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"I fancy I hear some people saying, ""Quite so; who ever denied or doubted"
768,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"it?"" The answer must be that, for some time past, it has been tacitly, and"
769,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"often explicitly, denied by critics and readers alike; reviewers to-day"
770,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,criticising poetry in utter disregard and contravention of any such
771,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"canons, and readers in their conversation and practice following suit,"
772,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,apparently without any knowledge or suspicion that such canons exist. Had
773,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"it been otherwise, an inquiry into the essentials of great poetry would"
774,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,have been unnecessary.
775,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
776,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"The permanent passions of mankind--love, religion, patriotism,"
777,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"humanitarianism, hate, revenge, ambition; the conflict between free will"
778,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"and fate; the rise and fall of empires--these are all great themes, and,"
779,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"if greatly treated, and in accordance with the essentials applicable to"
780,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"all poetry, may produce poetry of the loftiest kind; the underlying reason"
781,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"being what, as usual, has been better and more convincingly stated by"
782,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Shakespeare than by any one else:
783,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
784,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,We [actors on the stage] are not all alone unhappy:
785,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,This wide and universal theatre
786,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
787,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Wherein we play.
788,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
789,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"For the great treatment of great themes in Epic, and yet more in Dramatic,"
790,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Poetry, think of what is required! Not mere fancy, not mere emotion, but a"
791,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"wide and lofty imagination, a full and flexible style, a copious and ready"
792,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"vocabulary, an ear for verbal melody and all its cadences, profound"
793,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"knowledge of men, women, and things in general, a congenital and"
794,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"cultivated sense of form--the foundation of beauty and majesty alike, in"
795,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"all art; an experience of all the passions, yet the attainment to a"
796,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"certain majestic freedom from servitude to these; the descriptive,"
797,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"lyrical, and reflective capacity; abundance and variety of illustration; a"
798,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"strong apprehension and grasp of the Real, with the impulse and power to"
799,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"transfigure it into the Ideal, so that the Ideal shall seem to the reader"
800,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"to be the Real; in a word, ""blood and judgment,"" as Shakespeare says, ""so"
801,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"commingled."" These are the qualifications of the writers that have"
802,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"stirred, and still stir, in its worthier portion, the admiration,"
803,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"reverence, and gratitude of mankind."
804,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
805,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Even this does not exhaust the requisite endowments of those who aspire to
806,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,write great poetry. Their sympathy with all that is demands from them a
807,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"fund of practical good sense, too often lacking in merely lyrical"
808,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,poets--a circumstance that may render their work less attractive to the
809,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"average person, and even make it seem to such to be wanting in genius"
810,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,altogether. Sane they must essentially be; and their native sanity must
811,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"have been fortified by some share in practical affairs, while their"
812,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,robustness of mind must have received aid from the open air. They will be
813,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"found to be neither extravagant optimists nor extravagant pessimists, but"
814,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,wise teachers and indulgent moralists; neither teaching nor preaching
815,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"overmuch in their verse, but unintentionally and almost unconsciously"
816,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,communicating their wisdom to others by radiation. Dante always speaks of
817,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Virgil as ""Il Saggio."" Tennyson puts it well where he says of the poet,"
818,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"""He saw through good, through ill; He saw through his own soul."""
819,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Architecture, sculpture, music, the kindred of his own art, must be"
820,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,appreciated by him; and nothing that affects mankind is alien to him.
821,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
822,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"I should like to say, incidentally, and I hope I may do so without giving"
823,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"offence, that I have sometimes thought that, in an age much given to"
824,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"theorising and to considering itself more ""scientific"" than perhaps it"
825,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"really is, the diminution of practical wisdom, somewhat conspicuous of"
826,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"late in politics and legislation, is due in no small measure to the"
827,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"neglect of the higher poetry, in favour, where concern for poetry survives"
828,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"at all, of brief snatches of lyrical emotion. Hence legislation by emotion"
829,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,and haste.
830,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
831,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"If we ask ourselves, as it is but natural to do, what are the chief causes"
832,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"that have brought about this change in public taste and sentiment, I"
833,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,believe they will be found to be mainly as follow. (1) The decay of
834,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,authority already mentioned. (2) The perpetual reading of novels of every
835,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"kind, many of them of a pernicious nature, but nearly all of them"
836,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,calculated to indispose readers to care for any poetry save of an
837,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,emotional lyrical character. (3) The increase--be it said with all due
838,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,chivalry--of feminine influence and activity alike in society and
839,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"literature; women, generally speaking, showing but a moderate interest in"
840,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"great issues in public life, and finding their satisfaction, so far as"
841,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"reading is concerned, in prose romances, newspapers, and short lyrics. (4)"
842,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,The febrile quality of contemporaneous existence; the ephemeral
843,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,excitements of the passing hour; and the wholesale surrender to the
844,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"transient as contrasted with the permanent, great poetry concerning itself"
845,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"only with this last--a circumstance that makes the _Odyssey_, for"
846,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"instance, as fresh to-day as though it had been published for the first"
847,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"time last autumn; whereas the life of most prose romances, like the lady's"
848,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"scanty attire, _commence à peine, et finit tout de suite_."
849,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
850,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,I hope no one will imagine--for they would be mistaken in doing so--that
851,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,these pages have been prompted by a disposition to depreciate the age in
852,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"which we are living, and just as little to manifest disdain of it, though"
853,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"one need not conceal the opinion, in respect of the lower literary taste"
854,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"so widely prevalent, that, as Shakespeare says, ""it is not and it cannot"
855,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"be for good."" My object has been something very different from this. It"
856,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,has been to recall canons of poetry and standards of literary excellence
857,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,which I believe can never be destroyed though for a time they may be
858,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"obscured, and which have of late been too much ignored. That such neglect"
859,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,will in the very faintest degree prevent those whose instinct it is to
860,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"say, with Virgil, ""paulo majora canamus,"" from following their vocation,"
861,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"without a thought of readers or reviewers, I do not suppose. It is good"
862,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"for poets, and indeed for others, not to be too quickly appreciated. It is"
863,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"dangerous for them, and sometimes fatal, to be praised prematurely."
864,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
865,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"The great stumbling-block of literary criticism, alike for the"
866,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"professional critic and the unprofessional reader, is the tacit assumption"
867,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"that the opinions, preferences, and estimates of to-day are not merely"
868,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"passing opinions, preferences, and estimates, but will be permanent ones;"
869,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"opinions, preferences, and estimates for all future time. There is no"
870,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"foundation, save self-complacency, for such a surmise. What solid reason"
871,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,is there to suppose that the present age is any more infallible in its
872,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"literary judgments than preceding ages? On the contrary, its infallibility"
873,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,is all the less probable because of the precipitation with which its
874,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,opinions are arrived at. Yet past ages have been proved over and over
875,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"again, in course of time, to be wrong in their estimate of contemporaneous"
876,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"poetry, in consequence of their mistaking the passing for the permanent."
877,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,The consequence in our time of this error has been that one has seen the
878,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,passing away of several works loudly declared on their appearance to be
879,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,immortal. The only chance a critic has of being right in his judgments is
880,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,to measure contemporary literature by standards and canons upon which
881,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"rests the fame of the great poets and writers of the past, and, tried by"
882,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"which, Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, and Byron have been assigned"
883,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"their enduring rank in the poetic hierarchy. ""Blessings be with them,"""
884,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,says Wordsworth (Sonnet xxv.):
885,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
886,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Blessings be with them, and eternal praise,"
887,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Who gave us nobler lives and nobler cares,"
888,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,The Poets who on earth have made us heirs
889,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays.
890,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
891,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"It is only the great poets, the poets in whom we can recognise the"
892,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"essentials of greatness, who can do that for us. They are not rebels, as"
893,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"are too many lyrical poets, but reconcilers; and they offer to external"
894,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"things and current ideas both receptivity and resistance, being not merely"
895,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"of an age, but for all time. It is their thoughts and the verse in which"
896,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,their thoughts are embodied that are enduringly memorable. For great
897,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"poetry, as Wordsworth teaches us in a single line, is not mere emotion,"
898,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"not mere subtle or sensuous singing, but"
899,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
900,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,Reason in her most exalted mood.
901,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,
902,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"A still greater authority than Wordsworth, no other than Milton, has"
903,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,immortalised in verse the principles for which I have ventured to contend
904,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,in prose. In _Paradise Regained_ (iv. 255-266) he says:

907,THE ESSENTIALS OF GREAT POETRY,"Of harmony, in tones and numbers hit"

930,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"they have not been, and I think they never will be, met with in Poetry."
931,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"They are noisy, but numerically weak. Eve listening to the Tempter, then"
932,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,bewailing her weakness; Ruth amid the alien corn; Magdalen and her box of
933,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,spikenard; Helen of Troy following evil-hearted Paris; Beatrice in heaven;
934,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Una and the milk-white lamb; Rosalind and Celia in _As You Like It_; the
935,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Lily Maid of Astolat in the _Idylls of the King_--these are women of whom,"
936,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"or, at least, of the sentiments and sympathies of whom, as manifested in"
937,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"English poetry, I wish to speak. The most progressive age one can possibly"
938,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"conceive will never succeed in leaving human nature behind, and I have not"
939,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,the smallest doubt that women will continue to be womanly to the end of
940,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,time.
941,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
942,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"What, then, is feminine as contrasted with masculine? what is womanly as"
943,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"compared with manly, whether in literature or in life? Men and women have"
944,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"many qualities in common, and resemble more than they differ from each"
945,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"other. But while, speaking generally, the man's main occupations lie"
946,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"abroad, the woman's main occupation is at home. He has to deal with public"
947,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,and collective interests; she has to do with private and individual
948,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"interests. We need not go so far as to say, with Kingsley, that man must"
949,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"work and woman must weep; but at least he has to fight and to struggle,"
950,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"she has to solace and to heal. Ambition, sometimes high, sometimes low,"
951,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,but still ambition--ambition and success are the main motives and purpose
952,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"of his life. Her noblest ambition is to foster domestic happiness, to"
953,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"bring comfort to the afflicted, and to move with unostentatious but"
954,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,salutary step over the vast territory of human affection. While man busies
955,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"himself with the world of politics, with the world of commerce, with the"
956,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"rise and fall of empires, with the fortunes and fate of humanity, woman"
957,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"tends the hearth, visits the sick, consoles the suffering--in a word, in"
958,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"all she does, fulfils the sacred offices of love."
959,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
960,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Now the highest literature--and Poetry is confessedly the highest
961,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,literature--is a transfiguring reflex of life; and in its magic mirror we
962,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"perforce see reflected all the thoughts, feelings, interests, passions,"
963,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"and events of human existence. In English poetry, therefore, we shall"
964,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,expect to hear both the masculine note and the feminine note; and in what
965,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,proportions we hear them will be incidentally indicated in the course of
966,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,my remarks. But it is the Feminine Note in which we are at present
967,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"specially interested, and if I am asked to define briefly what I mean by"
968,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"this Feminine Note, I should say that I mean the private or domestic note,"
969,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"the compassionate note or note of pity, and the sentimental note or note"
970,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,of romantic love.
971,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
972,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Now I am well aware there are numbers of people who look on poetry as
973,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"something essentially and necessarily feminine, and who will say, ""What do"
974,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,you mean by speaking of the Feminine Note in English poetry? Surely it has
975,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"no other note, poetry being an effeminate business altogether, with which"
976,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"men, real robust men, need not concern themselves."" The people who hold"
977,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"this opinion can have but a very limited acquaintance with English poetry,"
978,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,and a yet more limited familiarity with the poetry of other ages and other
979,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"nations that has come down to us. As a matter of fact, though the feminine"
980,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"note has rarely, if ever, been wholly absent from poetry, it is only of"
981,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,late years comparatively that it has become a very audible note. I should
982,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,be carried too far away from my subject if I attempted to demonstrate the
983,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"accuracy of this assertion by a survey, however rapid, of all the"
984,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"best-known poetry in languages, dead and living, of other times and other"
985,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"peoples. But to cite one or two familiar examples, is the feminine note, I"
986,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"may ask, the predominant, or even a frequent, note in the _Iliad_? The"
987,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"poem opens, it is true, with a dispute among the Argive chiefs, and mainly"
988,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"between Agamemnon and Achilles, concerning two young women. But how"
989,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"quickly Chryseis and Bryseis fall into the background, and in place of any"
990,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"further reference to them, we have a tempest of manly voices, the clang of"
991,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"arms, the recriminations of the Gods up in Olympus, and the cataloguing of"
992,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"the Grecian ships! Lest perhaps tender interest should be absent overmuch,"
993,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,just when Paris is being worsted in his duel with Menelaus for the
994,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"determination of the siege, Venus carries him off under cover of a cloud,"
995,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,and brings Helen to his side. Then follows a scene in which the fair cause
996,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"of strife and slaughter stands distracted between her passion for Paris,"
997,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"her shame at his defeat and flight, and her recollection of the brave"
998,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Argive Chief she once called her lord. But more fighting promptly
999,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"supervenes, and, save in such a passing episode as the lovely leave-taking"
1000,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"of Hector and Andromache, the poem moves on through a magnificent medley"
1001,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"of fighting, plotting, and speech-making. Even in that exceptionally"
1002,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"tender episode what are the farewell words of Hector to his wife, ""Go to"
1003,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"your house and see to your own duties, the loom and the distaff, and bid"
1004,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"your handmaidens perform their tasks. But for war shall _man_ provide."" It"
1005,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,is over the dead body of Patroclus that Achilles weeps; and whatever tears
1006,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"are shed in the _Iliad_ are shed by heroes for heroes. Life, as"
1007,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"represented in that poem, is a life in which woman plays a shadowy and"
1008,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"insignificant part, and wherein domestic sentiments are subordinated to"
1009,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,the rivalries of the Gods and the clash of chariot-wheels.
1010,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1011,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"This subordinating of woman to man, of individual aims and private"
1012,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"feelings to great aims and public issues, is equally present in the great"
1013,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Latin poem, the _Æneid_. ""Arms and the Man, I sing,"" says Virgil at once,"
1014,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,and in the very first line of his poem; and though in one book out of the
1015,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"twelve of which it consists he sings of the woman likewise, it is but to"
1016,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,leave her to her fate and to liberate Æneas from her seductions. Virgil is
1017,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,rightly esteemed the most tender and refined writer of antiquity. Yet to
1018,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"the modern reader, accustomed to the feminine note in poetry, there is"
1019,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"something amazingly callous, almost cruel, in the lines with which, while"
1020,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"the funeral pyre of Dido is still smoking, he tells us how Æneas, without"
1021,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"a moment's hesitation, makes for the open sea, and sails away from"
1022,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Carthage. But then the main business of Æneas was not to soothe or satisfy
1023,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"the Carthaginian queen, but to build the city and found the Empire of"
1024,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Rome. ""Spirits,"" says Shakespeare, ""are not finely touched save to fine"
1025,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"issues""; and it never would have occurred to Virgil to allow the hero of"
1026,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,the _Æneid_ to be diverted from his masculine purpose by anything so
1027,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"secondary as the love, or even the self-immolation, of a woman."
1028,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1029,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Let us, however, overleap the intervening centuries, and betake ourselves"
1030,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"to the poetry of our own land and our own language. Chaucer, the first"
1031,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"great English poet, was, like all writers of supreme genius, a prolific"
1032,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"and voluminous writer, and we have thousands of verses of his besides the"
1033,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Prologue to the _Canterbury Tales_. But it is by this latter work that he
1034,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"is best known; and it is pre-eminently and adequately representative, both"
1035,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,of his own genius and of the temper of the times in which he lived. You
1036,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"will have to hunt very diligently through his description of the Knight,"
1037,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"the Squire, the Yeoman, the Prioress, the Monk, the Merchant, the Sergeant"
1038,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"of the Law, the Franklin, the Miller, the Manciple, and the rest of his"
1039,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"jovial company, in order to find anything approaching the feminine note."
1040,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"He says little about what any of them thought, and absolutely nothing"
1041,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"concerning what they felt, but confines himself to descriptions of their"
1042,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"personal appearance, of their conduct and their character, in a word, of"
1043,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,their external presentation of themselves. The Knight who wore a doublet
1044,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"all stained by his coat of mail, was well mounted, and had ridden far, no"
1045,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"man farther. The Squire, or page, had curly locks, and had borne himself"
1046,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"well in Flanders and Picardy. The Yeoman bore a weighty bow, handled his"
1047,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"arrows and tackle in admirable fashion, and was dressed in a coat of"
1048,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"green. The Monk was fat and in good case, and loved a roast swan more than"
1049,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"any other dish. The Friar, we are told, had made many a marriage at his"
1050,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"own cost, and would get a farthing out of a poor widow, though she had"
1051,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"only one shoe left. The Franklin had a white beard and a high complexion,"
1052,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"kept a capital table, and blew up his cook loudly if the sauces were not"
1053,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"to his liking. The Wife of Bath had married five husbands, not to speak of"
1054,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"other company in her youth; and the Sumpnor loved garlic, onions, and"
1055,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"leeks, had a fiery face, and doated on strong wine. There is nothing very"
1056,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"feminine in all this, is there? The one sole touch of tenderness that I"
1057,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"can remember, and it is very elementary and introduced quite casually, is"
1058,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,that in which we are told that the Prioress is so full of pity that she
1059,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,would weep if she saw a mouse caught in a trap. One can easily surmise
1060,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"what sort of tales would proceed from such downright, hearty, unromantic"
1061,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"personages; and, save where any of them recite well-known stories from"
1062,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"ancient poets, their own narratives are as buxom, burly, and as"
1063,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"unsentimental as themselves. If princes and princesses, fine lords and"
1064,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"ladies, be the heroes and heroines of the Tale, a certain amount of"
1065,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,conventional pity is extended to their woes. But if the personages of the
1066,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"story be, as they for the most part are, common folk, and such as the"
1067,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"story-tellers themselves would be likely to know, their misfortunes and"
1068,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,mishaps are used merely as a theme for mirth and merciless banter. The
1069,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"humour displayed is excellent, but it is not the humour of _charity_. It"
1070,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"is not compassionate, and it is not feminine. The feminine note is not"
1071,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"absent from Chaucer's Tales, but it is generally a subordinate note, a"
1072,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"rare note, a note scarcely heard in his great concert of masculine"
1073,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,voices.
1074,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1075,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Passing from the pages of Chaucer to those of Spenser is like passing from
1076,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"some cheery tavern where the ale is good and the jokes are excellent, but"
1077,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"a trifle coarse, and the company diverting but a little mixed, to the"
1078,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"banqueting-hall of some stately palace, where the wines and meats are of"
1079,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"the choicest, where all the guests are of high degree, the women all fair,"
1080,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"the men all courtly, and where fine manners and dignified speech leave no"
1081,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,place for loud lewd laughter or even for homely familiarity. Surely in one
1082,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"who is such a poet, and such a gentleman, and in every respect, to quote a"
1083,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"line of his own ""a very perfect gentle knight,"" we shall come across, ever"
1084,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"and anon at least, the feminine note. And indeed we do. The first three"
1085,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,stanzas of the _Fairy Queen_ are dedicated to the description of the
1086,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Knight that was pricking on the plain. But listen to the fourth:
1087,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1088,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"A lovely lady rode him fair beside,"
1089,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Upon a lowly ass more white than snow;
1090,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Yet she much whiter; but the same did hide
1091,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Under a veil that wimpled was full low,"
1092,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,And over all a black stole did she throw;
1093,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"As one that inly mourned, so was she sad,"
1094,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,And heavy sate upon her palfrey slow.
1095,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Seemëd at heart some hidden care she had.
1096,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,And by her in a line a milk-white lamb she lad.
1097,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,So pure and innocent as that same lamb
1098,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"She was, in life and every virtuous lore."
1099,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,She by descent from royal lineage came.
1100,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1101,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Her name, as doubtless you well know, was Una, and, when by foul"
1102,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"enchantment she is severed a while from her true knight, harken with what"
1103,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,a truly feminine note Spenser bewails her misfortune:
1104,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1105,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Nought is there under heaven's wide hollowness
1106,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Did recover more dear compassion of the mind
1107,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Than beauty brought to unworthy wretchedness
1108,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Through envy's snare, or fortune's freaks unkind."
1109,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"I, whether lately through her brightness blind,"
1110,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Or through allegiance, and fast fealty"
1111,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Which I do owe unto all womankind,"
1112,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Feel my heart prest with so great agony,"
1113,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"When such I see, that all for pity I could die."
1114,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1115,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Spenser cannot endure the thought of beauty in distress. So at once he
1116,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"brings upon the scene a ramping lion, which, in the ordinary course of"
1117,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,things would have put a speedy end to her woes. But not so Spenser's lion:
1118,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1119,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Instead thereof he kissed her weary feet,"
1120,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"And licked her lily hands with fawning tongue,"
1121,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,As he her wrongëd innocence did weet.
1122,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,O how can beauty master the most strong.
1123,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1124,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,And thus he goes on:
1125,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1126,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"The lion would not leave her desolate,"
1127,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"But with her went along, as a strong guard"
1128,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Of her chaste person, and a faithful mate"
1129,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Of her sad troubles and misfortunes hard:
1130,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Still when she slept, he kept both watch and ward,"
1131,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"And when she waked, he waited diligent"
1132,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,With humble service to her will prepared.
1133,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1134,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,This allegiance and fast fealty which Spenser declares he owes unto all
1135,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"womankind is the attitude, not only of all true knights and all true"
1136,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"gentlemen, but likewise, I trust, of all true poets. But do not suppose on"
1137,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,that account that Spenser is a feminine poet. He is very much the reverse.
1138,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,It would be impossible for a poet to be more masculine than he.
1139,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1140,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Upon a great adventure he was bound,"
1141,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1142,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"he says at once of his hero, and describes how the knight's heart groaned"
1143,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"to prove his prowess in battle brave. Spenser has the feminine note, but"
1144,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,in subordination to the masculine note; and if I were asked to name some
1145,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,one quality by which you may know whether a poet be of the very highest
1146,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"rank, I should be disposed to say, ""See if in his poetry you meet with the"
1147,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"feminine note and the masculine note, and if the first be duly"
1148,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"subordinated to the second."""
1149,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1150,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"I wish it were possible, within the limit I have here assigned myself, to"
1151,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,apply this test and pursue this enquiry at length in regard to
1152,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Shakespeare, in regard to Milton, and likewise in regard to Dryden and"
1153,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Pope. But of this I am sure that the wider and deeper the survey the more
1154,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"clear would be the conclusion that in Shakespeare, as we might have"
1155,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"expected, the masculine note and the feminine note are heard in perfect"
1156,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"harmony, but by far the larger volume of sound proceeds from the former."
1157,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1158,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"When, then, was it that the feminine note, the domestic or personal note,"
1159,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"the compassionate note or note of pity, the purely sentimental note, was"
1160,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,first heard in English poetry as a note asserting equality with the
1161,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"masculine note, and tending to assert itself as the dominant note?"
1162,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1163,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,One of the most beautiful and best-known poems in the English language is
1164,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Gray's _Elegy written in a Country Churchyard_; and in the following
1165,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"stanzas which many of you will recognise as belonging to it, do we not"
1166,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,seem to overhear something like the note of which we are in search?--
1167,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1168,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Beneath those rugged elms, that yew tree's shade,"
1169,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap,"
1170,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,"
1171,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.
1172,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1173,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"The breezy call of incense-breathing Morn,"
1174,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"The swallow twitt'ring from the straw-built shed,"
1175,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,"
1176,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.
1177,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1178,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,"
1179,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Or busy housewife ply her ev'ning care:
1180,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"No children run to lisp their sire's return,"
1181,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.
1182,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1183,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Here our sympathy is asked, not for kings and princesses, not for great"
1184,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"lords and fine ladies, not for the rise and fall of empires, but for the"
1185,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"rude forefathers of the hamlet, for the busy housewife, for the"
1186,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"hard-working peasant and his children, for homely joys and the annals of"
1187,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,the poor. But Gray does not maintain this note beyond the five stanzas I
1188,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"have just quoted. He quickly again lapses into the traditional, the"
1189,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"classic, the purely masculine note:"
1190,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1191,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"The boast of Heraldry, the pomp of Pow'r,"
1192,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"And all that Beauty, all that Wealth e'er gave,"
1193,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Await alike th' inevitable hour,"
1194,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,The paths of glory lead but to the grave.
1195,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1196,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Nor you, ye proud, impute to these the fault,"
1197,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"If Mem'ry o'er their tombs no trophies raise,"
1198,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Where through the long-drawn aisle, and fretted vault,"
1199,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.
1200,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1201,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Can storied urn, or animated bust,"
1202,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?
1203,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust,"
1204,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Or Flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of Death?
1205,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1206,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"The stanzas that follow are splendid stanzas, but they are the stately and"
1207,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"sonorous verse of a detached and moralising mind, not the pathetic verse"
1208,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,of a sympathising heart. We have to wait another twenty years before we
1209,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,come upon a poem of consequence in which the feminine note is not only
1210,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"present, but paramount. In the year 1770, nearly a century and a half"
1211,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"ago, appeared Goldsmith's poem, _The Deserted Village_, and in it I catch,"
1212,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"for the first time, as the prevailing and predominant note, the note of"
1213,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"feminine compassion, the note of humble happiness and humble grief. In"
1214,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Goldsmith's verse we hear nothing of great folks except to be told how
1215,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,small and insignificant are the ills which they can cause or cure.
1216,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1217,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Princes and lords may flourish, or may fade;"
1218,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"A breath can make them, as a breath hath made;"
1219,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"But a bold peasantry, their country's pride,"
1220,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"When once destroyed, can never be supplied."
1221,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1222,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Goldsmith's themes in _The Deserted Village_ are avowedly:
1223,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1224,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"The sheltered cot, the cultivated farm,"
1225,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"The never-failing brook, the busy mill,"
1226,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"The decent church that topped the neighbouring hill,"
1227,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"The hawthorn bush, with seats beneath the shade,"
1228,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,For talking age and whispering lovers made.
1229,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1230,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"We seem to have travelled centuries away from the _Troilus and Cressida_,"
1231,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"or the _Palamon and Arcite_ of Chaucer, from the Red Cross Knight and Una,"
1232,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"from the Britomart, the Florimel, the Calidore, the Gloriana of Spenser,"
1233,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"from the kingly ambitions and princely passions of Shakespeare, from the"
1234,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"throes and denunciations of _Paradise Lost_, and equally from the"
1235,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,coffee-house epigrams and savage satire of Pope. We have at last got among
1236,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"ordinary people, among humble folk, people of our own flesh and blood,"
1237,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,with simple joys and simple sorrows. What could be more unlike the poetry
1238,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,we have so far been surveying than these lines from _The Deserted
1239,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Village_?--
1240,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1241,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Sweet was the sound when oft at evening's close
1242,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Up yonder hill the village murmur rose,"
1243,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"There, as I passed, with careless steps and slow,"
1244,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,The mingling notes came softened from below.
1245,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"The swain responsive as the milkmaid sung,"
1246,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"The sober herd that lowed to meet their young,"
1247,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"The noisy geese that gabbled o'er the pool,"
1248,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,The playful children just let loose from school.
1249,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1250,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Which of you does not remember the description in the same poem of the
1251,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Village Clergyman? the man who was to all his country dear, etc. Some of"
1252,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"you, I daresay, know it by heart. Nothing is too lowly, some would say,"
1253,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"nothing too mean, for Goldsmith's tender Muse. He loves to dwell on the"
1254,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"splendour of the humble parlour, on the whitewashed wall, the sanded"
1255,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"floor, the varnished clock, the chest of drawers, and the chimney-piece"
1256,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,with its row of broken teacups. Truly it is a feminine Muse which can make
1257,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"poetry, and, in my opinion, very charming poetry, out of broken teacups."
1258,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1259,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"The feminine note once struck, the note of personal tenderness, of"
1260,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"domestic interest, of compassion for the homely, the suffering, or the"
1261,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,secluded was never again to be absent from English poetry; and Cowper
1262,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"continued, without a break, the still sad music of humanity first clearly"
1263,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,uttered by Goldsmith. What is the name of Cowper's principal and most
1264,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"ambitious poem? As you know, it is called _The Task_; and what are the"
1265,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,respective titles of the six books into which it is divided? They are:
1266,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"_The Sofa_, _The Time-Piece_, _The Garden_, _The Winter Evening_, _The"
1267,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Winter Morning Walk_, _The Winter Walk at Noon_. Other poems of a kindred"
1268,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"character are entitled _Hope_, _Charity_, _Conversation_, _Retirement_."
1269,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Open what page you will of Cowper's verse, and you will be pretty sure to"
1270,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"find him either denouncing things which women, good women, at least, find"
1271,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"abhorrent, such as the slave-trade, gin-drinking, gambling, profligacy,"
1272,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"profane language, or dwelling on occupations which are dear to them."
1273,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1274,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"O for a lodge in some vast wilderness,"
1275,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1276,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,he exclaims--
1277,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1278,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Some boundless contiguity of shade,"
1279,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Where rumour of oppression and deceit
1280,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Of unsuccessful or successful war,"
1281,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Might never reach me more! My ear is pained,"
1282,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,My soul is sick with every day's report
1283,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Of wrong and outrage with which earth is filled.
1284,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"There is no flesh in man's obdurate heart,"
1285,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,It does not feel for man.
1286,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1287,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"These are the opening lines of the _Time-Piece_, and they sound what may"
1288,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,be called the note of feminine indignation; a note which is reverted to by
1289,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,him again and again.
1290,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1291,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"More placidly but still in the same spirit, he exclaims:"
1292,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1293,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Now stir the fire and close the shutters fast,"
1294,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Let fall the curtains, wheel the sofa round,"
1295,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,And while the bubbling and loud hissing urn
1296,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Throws up a steaming column, and the cups"
1297,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"That cheer but not inebriate, wait on each,"
1298,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,So let us welcome peaceful evening in.
1299,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1300,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Farther on, he describes how--"
1301,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1302,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,'Tis pleasant through the loopholes of retreat
1303,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"To peep at such a world, to see the stir"
1304,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Of the great Babel, and not feel the crowd."
1305,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Thus sitting, and surveying thus at ease"
1306,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"The globe and its concerns, I seem advanced"
1307,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"To some secure and more than mortal height,"
1308,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,That liberates and exempts me from them all.
1309,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1310,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Again, invoking evening, he says:"
1311,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1312,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Come then, and thou shalt find thy votary calm"
1313,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Or make me so. Composure is thy gift:
1314,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,And whether I devote the gentle hours of evening
1315,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"To books, to music, or the poet's toil,"
1316,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"To weaving nets for bird-alluring fruit,"
1317,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Or turning silken threads round ivory reels,"
1318,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,When they command whom man was born to please.
1319,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1320,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Could there well be a more feminine picture than that? All the politics,"
1321,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"commerce, passions, conflicts of the world are shut out by Mrs. Unwin's"
1322,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"comfortable curtains, and, with her and Lady Austen for sympathising"
1323,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"companions, the poet fills his time, with perfect satisfaction, by holding"
1324,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"their skeins of wool, and meditating such homely lines as these:"
1325,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1326,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"For I, contented with a humble theme,"
1327,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Have poured my stream of panegyric down
1328,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,The vale of nature where it creeps and winds
1329,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Among her lovely works, with a secure"
1330,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,And unambitious ease reflecting clear
1331,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"If not the virtues, yet the worth of brutes."
1332,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"And I am recompensed, and deem the toils"
1333,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Of poetry not lost, if verse of mine"
1334,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"May stand between an animal and woe,"
1335,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,And teach one tyrant pity for his drudge.
1336,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1337,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Cowper was never married, nor ever, as far as I know, in love, though Lady"
1338,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Austen, to her and his misfortune, for a time seemed to fancy he was; and"
1339,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,in his verse therefore we do not meet with the note of amatory sentiment.
1340,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"But what love is there in this world more beautiful, more touching, more"
1341,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"truly romantic, than the love of a mother for her son, and of a son for"
1342,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,his mother? And where has it been more charmingly expressed than in
1343,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Cowper's lines on the receipt of his mother's picture? After that
1344,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,beautiful outburst--
1345,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1346,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,O that those lips had language! Life has passed
1347,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,With me but roughly since I heard thee last
1348,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1349,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"--he proceeds to recall the home, the scenes, the tender incidents of his"
1350,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"childhood, but, most of all, the fond care bestowed on him by his mother:"
1351,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1352,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Thy nightly visits to my chamber made
1353,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"That thou mightst know me safe and warmly laid,"
1354,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Thy fragrant waters on my cheek bestowed
1355,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"By thy own hand, till fresh they were and glowed,"
1356,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"All this, and more endearing still than all,"
1357,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Thy constant flow of love that knew no fall,"
1358,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Ne'er roughened by those cataracts and breaks
1359,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,That humour interposed too often makes;
1360,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"All this still legible in memory's page,"
1361,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"And still to be so to my latest age,"
1362,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Adds joy to duty, makes me glad to pay"
1363,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Such honour to thee as my numbers may,"
1364,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Perhaps a frail memorial, but sincere,"
1365,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Not scorned in Heaven, though little noticed here."
1366,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1367,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,The lines are not in what is called the highest vein of poetry. They have
1368,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,not the bluff masculinity of Chaucer. They lack the magic of Spenser. They
1369,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,do not purify the passions through terror as is done by _Lear_ or
1370,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"_Macbeth_, and they are much inferior in majesty to the"
1371,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1372,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Cherubic trumpets blowing martial sound
1373,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1374,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"of Milton. But they come straight from the heart, and go straight to the"
1375,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"heart. They are thoroughly human, what we all have felt, or are much to be"
1376,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,pitied if we have not felt. They are instinct with the holiest form of
1377,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"domestic piety. They are feminine in the best sense, and have all the"
1378,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"feminine power to attract, to chasten, and to subdue."
1379,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1380,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"As far as character and conduct are concerned, there could not well be two"
1381,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,poets more unlike than Cowper and Burns; and their poetry is as unlike as
1382,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,their temperament. I fear Burns indulged in most of the vices against
1383,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,which Cowper inveighs; and not unoften he glorified them in verse. Upon
1384,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,that theme do not ask me to dwell this evening. All it is necessary to
1385,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"point out here is, that in Burns, as in Cowper, and as in Goldsmith, we"
1386,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"have the compassionate note, the note of pity for suffering, of sympathy"
1387,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"with the lowly; in a word, we again have the feminine note. In _The"
1388,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Cotter's Saturday Night_ Burns paints a picture, as complete as it is"
1389,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"simple, of humble life. We have the cotter returning home through the"
1390,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"chill November blast with the weary beasts; the collecting of his spades,"
1391,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"his mattocks, and his hoes; the arrival at his cottage; the expectant wee"
1392,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,things running out to meet him; the ingle-nook blinking bonnily; the
1393,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,cheerful supper of wholesome porridge; the reading of a passage from the
1394,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Bible, the evening hymn, and the family prayer before retiring to rest."
1395,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,There is a line in _The Cotter's Saturday Night_ which might be taken as
1396,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,the text on which most of Burns's poems are written:
1397,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1398,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,The cottage leaves the palace far behind.
1399,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1400,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"All his sympathies are with cottages and cottagers, whether he be"
1401,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"expressly describing their existence, writing _A Man's a Man for a' that_,"
1402,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"_The Birks of Aberfeldy_, _Auld Lang Syne_, or addressing lines to a mouse"
1403,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,whose nest he has turned up with his plough. All are written in a spirit
1404,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"of compassion for suffering, of sympathy with the lowly, of admiration for"
1405,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"honest poverty. They are fundamentally tender, and, though expressed in"
1406,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"manly fashion enough, fundamentally feminine, the poetry of a man who"
1407,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,lived habitually under the influence of women.
1408,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1409,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,I think it will be allowed that I have given no grudging admiration to the
1410,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"feminine note in English poetry, and in so far as it is a note of sympathy"
1411,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"with the more humble and less fortunate ones of the earth. But, in verse,"
1412,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"kindly and compassionate sentiment is not everything. Indeed, it is"
1413,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"nothing at all unless it be expressed in such a manner, the manner"
1414,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"suffused with charm of style, that it is thereby raised to the dignity of"
1415,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,true poetry. There are many excellent persons who accept as poetry any
1416,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"sentiment, or any opinion expressed in metre with which they happen to"
1417,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,agree. But neither sound opinion nor wholesome sentiment suffices to
1418,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,produce that exceedingly delicate and subtle thing which alone is rightly
1419,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"termed poetry, and, in abandoning lofty themes, and descending to humbler"
1420,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"ones, writers of verse unquestionably expose themselves to the danger not"
1421,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"only of not rising above the level of their subject, but even of sinking"
1422,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,below it. The Romans had a proverb that you cannot carve a Mercury out of
1423,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"every piece of wood, meaning thereby that by reason of Mercury not being a"
1424,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"standing or reposing figure, but a figure flying through the air, and"
1425,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"therefore with limbs and wings extended, the material out of which he is"
1426,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,made has to be both considerable in size and excellent in quality. What is
1427,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,true of Mercury is truer still of Apollo. You cannot make poetry out of
1428,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,every subject; and your only chance of making poetry out of any subject is
1429,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"to do so by treating the subject either nobly, or with charm. Realism,"
1430,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"unadulterated Realism, which is a dangerous experiment in prose, is a"
1431,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"sheer impossibility in poetry; for in poetry what is offered us, and what"
1432,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"delights us, is not realistic but ideal representation. No doubt the very"
1433,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,music of verse is part of the means whereby this ideal representation is
1434,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"effected; but it will not of itself suffice, as may easily be proved by"
1435,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,reciting mere nonsense verses in which the rhythm or music may be
1436,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"faultless. I could quote page after page from Cowper, which is verse only,"
1437,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"and not poetry, because it is nothing more than the bare statement of a"
1438,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"fact set forth in lines consisting of so many feet. Here, for instance, is"
1439,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,a specimen. It comes in his poem on _The Sofa_:
1440,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1441,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Joint-stools were then created, on three legs,"
1442,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Upborne they stood: three legs upholding firm
1443,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"A mossy slab, in fashion square or round."
1444,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,At length a generation more refined
1445,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Improved the simple plan, made three legs four,"
1446,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Gave them a twisted form vermicular
1447,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,And o'er the seat with plenteous wadding stuffed
1448,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Induced a splendid cover, green and blue,"
1449,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Yellow and red, of tapestry richly wrought,"
1450,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"And woven close, or needlework sublime."
1451,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1452,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Perhaps you think this is a parody of Cowper. But I can assure you it is
1453,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,nothing of the kind. It was written by the poet himself; and in his
1454,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,abounding pages you will find hundreds of verses of this realistic and
1455,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"pedestrian character. But not Cowper alone, one much greater than Cowper,"
1456,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"one who rose over and over again to the very heaven of poesy, Wordsworth"
1457,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"himself, has likewise left hundreds, aye, thousands of verses, little"
1458,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"better than the passage I have just read from Cowper, through the mistaken"
1459,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"notion that kindly feeling, compassion for the poor and the patient, and"
1460,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"sound moral sentiments, when expressed in verse, must result in poetry."
1461,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,There is no one here whose admiration of Wordsworth at his best can be
1462,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"greater than mine, but, in order to show you how the feminine note in"
1463,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"poetry, the note of sympathy with the weak, the obscure, and the"
1464,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"unfortunate, can even in the voice of a great master of poetry, lapse into"
1465,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"verse utterly destitute of the soul and spirit of poetry, I will ask you"
1466,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"to allow me to read you a portion of _Simon Lee, the Old Huntsman_:"
1467,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1468,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,And he is lean and he is sick;
1469,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"His body, dwindled and awry,"
1470,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Rests upon ankles swoln and thick;
1471,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,His legs are thin and dry.
1472,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"One prop he has, and only one,"
1473,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"His Wife, an aged woman,"
1474,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Lives with him, near the waterfall,"
1475,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Upon the village Common.
1476,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1477,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Oft, working by her husband's side,"
1478,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Ruth does what Simon cannot do;
1479,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"For she, with scanty cause for pride,"
1480,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Is stouter of the two.
1481,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,And though you with your utmost skill
1482,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"From labour could not wean them,"
1483,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Alas! 'tis very little--all
1484,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Which they can do between them.
1485,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1486,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,O Reader! had you in your mind
1487,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Such stores as silent thought can bring,"
1488,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,O gentle Reader! you would find
1489,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,A tale in everything.
1490,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"What more I have to say is short,"
1491,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,And you must kindly take it:
1492,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"It is no tale; but, should you _think_,"
1493,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Perhaps a tale you'll make it.
1494,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1495,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Is not that sorry stuff, regarded as poetry? Wordsworth here had the"
1496,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"assistance of the music, not only of verse, but of rhyme; and with what a"
1497,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"result! It is the feminine note of pity in its dotage, whereby we see"
1498,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"that it is not enough to have a warm heart, to have tender feelings, to be"
1499,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"full of sympathy for the suffering, and then to express them in verse. In"
1500,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"the prose of conversation and of everyday life, kindly feeling is all well"
1501,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,enough. But the Heavenly Muse will not place herself at our disposal so
1502,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"readily and cheaply. She is a very difficult lady, is the Heavenly Muse,"
1503,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"not easily won, and never allowing you, if you want to remain in her good"
1504,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"graces, to approach her, that is to say, in dressing gown and slippers."
1505,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"She is the noblest and most gracious lady in the world, and the best, the"
1506,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"most refined, the most elevating of companions. Therefore you must come"
1507,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"into her presence and win her favour, not with free-and-easy gait and in"
1508,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"slovenly attire, but arrayed in your very best, and with courtly and"
1509,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"deferential mien. When poets wrote of gods and goddesses, of mighty"
1510,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"sieges, and of the foundation and fall of empires; when their theme was"
1511,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"the madness of princes, and the tragic fate of kings, when their hero was"
1512,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Lucifer, Son of the Morning, nay, even when they discoursed of free will"
1513,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"and fate, or of the drawing-room intrigues of persons to whom powder,"
1514,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"patches, billets-doux were the chief things in existence, there was no"
1515,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"need to remind them that their style must be as lofty, as dignified, as"
1516,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"refined, or as finished as their subject. No doubt, they sometimes waxed"
1517,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"stilted and fell into excess, whether in rhetoric or in conceits, but they"
1518,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"never forgot themselves so far as to be slovenly or familiar. Stella, you"
1519,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"know, said Swift could write beautifully about a broomstick. Possibly he"
1520,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"could; but note the concession, that if a man writes, at least if he would"
1521,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"write poetry, he must write _beautifully_. Both Cowper and Wordsworth set"
1522,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"the example of writing verse that is not beautiful, though indeed Young"
1523,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"in his _Night Thoughts_, and Thomson in _The Seasons_, had already done"
1524,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"something of the same kind. But they have not the authority of Cowper,"
1525,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,much less the authority of Wordsworth. Let who will be the authority for
1526,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"it, prosaic utterance in verse, realism in rhyme, no matter what the"
1527,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"subject, is an incongruity that cannot be too severely condemned. A very"
1528,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"large proportion of the verse of Crabbe, once so popular, but now, I"
1529,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"fancy, but little read, is of little value, by reason of the presence of"
1530,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"this defect. Yet while I indicate, and venture to reprove, the feebleness"
1531,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,into which the feminine note in English poetry has too often declined and
1532,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"deteriorated, never let us forget that it has contributed lovely and"
1533,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"immortal poetry to the language, poetry to be found in Wordsworth, poetry"
1534,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"such as melts us almost to tears in Hood's _Song of the Shirt_, or in Mrs."
1535,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Barrett Browning's _The Cry of the Children_. Horace, who was a great"
1536,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"critic as well as a great poet, said long ago that it is extremely"
1537,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,difficult to express oneself concerning ordinary everyday facts and
1538,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,feelings in a becoming and agreeable manner; and to do this in verse
1539,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,demands supreme genius. As a set-off to the example of feebleness I just
1540,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"now cited in Wordsworth, listen how, when the mood of inspiration is on"
1541,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"him, he can see a Highland girl reaping in a field--surely an ordinary"
1542,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,everyday sight--and threw around her the heavenly halo of the divinest
1543,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,poetry:
1544,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1545,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Behold her, single in the field,"
1546,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Yon solitary Highland Lass!
1547,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Reaping and singing by herself;
1548,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Stop here, or gently pass!"
1549,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Alone she cuts, and binds the grain,"
1550,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,And sings a melancholy strain;
1551,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,O listen! for the Vale profound
1552,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Is overflowing with the sound.
1553,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1554,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,No Nightingale did ever chaunt
1555,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,So sweetly to reposing bands
1556,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Of Travellers in some shady haunt,"
1557,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Among Arabian sands:
1558,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,A voice so thrilling ne'er was heard
1559,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"In spring-time from the Cuckoo-bird,"
1560,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Breaking the silence of the seas
1561,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Among the farthest Hebrides.
1562,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1563,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Will no one tell me what she sings?
1564,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow
1565,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"For old, unhappy, far-off things,"
1566,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,And battles long ago:
1567,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Or is it some more humble lay,"
1568,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Familiar matter of to-day?
1569,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,"
1570,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"That has been, and may be again?"
1571,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1572,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Whate'er the theme, the Maiden sang"
1573,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,As if her song could have no ending;
1574,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"I saw her singing at her work,"
1575,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,And o'er the sickle bending;--
1576,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"I listened till I had my fill,"
1577,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"And when I mounted up the hill,"
1578,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"The music in my heart I bore,"
1579,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Long after it was heard no more.
1580,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1581,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"But there is another manifestation of the feminine note in English poetry,"
1582,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"distinct from, though doubtless akin to, the one we have been considering;"
1583,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"a note which likewise was not heard in it till about a hundred years ago,"
1584,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"but which has been heard very frequently since, and which seems at times"
1585,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"to threaten to become its dominant and all-prevailing note, or at any rate"
1586,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,the only one that is keenly listened to. Instead of the note of interest
1587,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"in and pity for others, it has become the note of interest in and pity"
1588,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"either for oneself, or for one's other self; a note so strongly personal"
1589,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,and suggestive as to become egotistic and entirely self-regarding. This
1590,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"is the amatory or erotic note, which I think you will all recognise when I"
1591,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,give it that designation; the note which appears to consider the love of
1592,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"the sexes as the only important thing in life, and certainly the only"
1593,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"thing worth writing or singing about. More than two thousand years ago, a"
1594,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Greek poet wrote a lyric beginning, ""I would fain sing of the heroes of"
1595,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"the House of Atreus, I would fain chant the glories of the line of Cadmus;"
1596,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"but my lyre refuses to sound any note save that of love."" In these days"
1597,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,the poet who expressed that sentiment and acted on it would have a great
1598,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"many listeners; and no doubt Anacreon, too, had his audience in ancient"
1599,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Greece. But he was not ranked by them side by side with their great poets
1600,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,who _did_ take the tragic story of the House of Atreus for their theme. It
1601,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,can only be when feminine influence is supreme in society and in
1602,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"literature, and when the feminine note in poetry has become, or threatens"
1603,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"to become, paramount, that the sentiment and practice of Anacreon is"
1604,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,viewed with approbation and favour. Byron has said in a well-known
1605,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,passage:
1606,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1607,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,For love is of man's life a thing apart;
1608,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,'Tis woman's whole existence.
1609,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1610,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"If I know anything about women, that is a gross exaggeration, unless in"
1611,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"the term love be included love of parents, love of brothers and sisters,"
1612,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"love of children, in a word, every form and manifestation of affection."
1613,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Still it is not necessary to deny--indeed if it be true it is necessary to
1614,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"admit--that love, in the narrower if more intense signification of the"
1615,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"word, does play a larger part in the lives, or at any rate in the"
1616,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"imagination, of most women than it does in the lives and the imagination"
1617,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"of most men; and it is not to be denied that practically all women, and a"
1618,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"fair sprinkling of men, now take an almost exclusive interest in the"
1619,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"amatory note in poetry. Nor let any one say that this was always so, and"
1620,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,that poetry and poets have from time immemorial occupied themselves mainly
1621,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,with the passion of love. Indeed they have not done so. It would be to
1622,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"show an utter ignorance of the genius of Homer, of the great Greek"
1623,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"dramatists, of Virgil, of Dante, of Spenser, of Shakespeare, of Milton,"
1624,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"and of the temper of the times in which they lived, to say that they could"
1625,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"sound only notes of love. They sounded these sometimes, but seldom and"
1626,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"rarely, in comparison with their other and more masculine notes, and"
1627,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,always in due subordination to these. I will not go so far as to say that
1628,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"they thought, with Napoleon, that love is the occupation of the idle, and"
1629,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"the idleness of the occupied, but they knew that however absorbing for a"
1630,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,season the passion of love as described by many poets and by nearly all
1631,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"modern novelists may be, it _is_ a thing apart; and, as such, they dealt"
1632,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"with it. They did not ignore its existence, or even its importance, but"
1633,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"they did not exaggerate its existence and its importance, relatively to"
1634,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"other interests, other occupations, other duties in life. It was because"
1635,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,of the high fealty and allegiance which Spenser declared he owed to all
1636,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,womankind that he did not represent women as perpetually sighing or being
1637,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,sighed for by men. It was because Shakespeare had such absolute
1638,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"familiarity, not with this or that part of life, but with the whole of it,"
1639,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"that even in _Romeo and Juliet_, in _Othello_, in _Measure for Measure_,"
1640,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"and again in _As You Like It_, he represented the passion of love at work"
1641,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"and in operation along with other sentiments and other passions; and, in"
1642,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"the greater portion of his dramas either does not introduce it at all, or"
1643,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,assigns to it a quite subordinate place. In _Romeo and Juliet_ the brave
1644,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Mercutio, the Tybalt ""deaf to peace,"" the garrulous nurse, the true"
1645,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"apothecary, the comfortable Friar, as Juliet calls him, all these and"
1646,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"more, have their exits and their entrances, and all, in turn, demand our"
1647,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,attention. _Romeo and Juliet_ is a love-drama indeed; but even in _Romeo
1648,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"and Juliet_, though love occupies the foremost place and plays the leading"
1649,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"part, it stands in relation to other passions and other characters, and"
1650,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,moves onward to its doom surrounded and accompanied by a medley of other
1651,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"circumstances and occurrences; just as true love, even the most"
1652,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"engrossing, does in real life. The same just apprehension of life, the"
1653,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,same observance of accurate proportion between the action of love and the
1654,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"action of other passions and other interests, may be observed in"
1655,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,_Othello_. Othello is not represented merely as a man who is consumed and
1656,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"maddened by jealousy, but as a citizen and a soldier, encompassed by"
1657,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"friends and enemies, and brought into contact, not with Desdemona and Iago"
1658,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"alone, but with the Duke of Venice, with valiant Cassio, with witty"
1659,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Montano, with Brabantio, with Gratiano, in a word with people and things"
1660,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,in general.
1661,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1662,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Neither would it be any more to the purpose to object that Herrick, that"
1663,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Suckling, that Lovelace, and other poets of the seventeenth century wrote"
1664,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"love-lyrics by the score, with many of which I have no doubt you are"
1665,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"acquainted, and some of which are very beautiful. For these, for the most"
1666,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"part, were amatory exercises, not real breathing and burning love-poems;"
1667,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"dainty works of art sometimes, but not sicklied o'er with the pale cast of"
1668,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,amatory passion. They were seventeenth-century reminiscences of the
1669,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"conventional love-lyrics of the Troubadours of Provence, when there"
1670,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,existed an imaginary court of Love and a host of imaginary lovers.
1671,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Indeed, if I were asked what was the truest and most succinct note uttered"
1672,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"by their English imitators, I think I should have to say that I seem to"
1673,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,catch it most distinctly in the lines of Suckling beginning:
1674,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1675,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Why so pale and wan, fond lover?"
1676,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Prithee, why so pale?"
1677,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1678,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,--and ending with:
1679,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1680,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"If of herself she will not love,"
1681,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Nothing can make her:
1682,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,The devil take her!
1683,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1684,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"But we catch a very different amatory note, and that of the most personal"
1685,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"and earnest kind, when the voice of Burns, and then the voice of Byron,"
1686,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,were heard in English poetry. In Byron the note is almost always
1687,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"passionate. In Burns it is sometimes sentimental, sometimes jovial,"
1688,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"sometimes humorous, sometimes frankly and offensively coarse. Many readers"
1689,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,cannot do full justice to the North-Country dialect in the following
1690,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"lines, but the most Southern of accents could not quite spoil their simple"
1691,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,beauty:
1692,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1693,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,The westlin wind blaws loud an' shrill;
1694,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"The night's baith mirk and rainy, O;"
1695,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"But I'll get my plaid, an' out I'll steal,"
1696,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"An' owre the hills to Nannie, O."
1697,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1698,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Her face is fair, her heart is true,"
1699,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"As spotless as she's bonnie, O:"
1700,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"The op'ning gowan, wat wi' dew,"
1701,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Nae purer is than Nannie, O."
1702,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1703,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"That is one amatory, one feminine note in Burns. Here is another:"
1704,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1705,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"There's nought but care on every han',"
1706,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"In every hour that passes, O;"
1707,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"What signifies the life o' man,"
1708,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"An' 'twere na for the lasses, O."
1709,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1710,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Auld Nature swears the lovely dears
1711,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Her noblest work she classes, O:"
1712,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Her 'prentice han' she tried on man,"
1713,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"An' then she made the lasses, O."
1714,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1715,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,I have no fault to find with these lines. They express a profound and
1716,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"enduring truth; and, if they do so with some little exaggeration, they do"
1717,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"it half humorously, and so protect themselves against criticism. But I"
1718,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,really think--I hope you will not deem me unchivalrous in saying so--we
1719,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"have, during the present century, heard too much, both in poetry and in"
1720,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"prose romance, as we are now hearing too much in newspapers and magazines,"
1721,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"of ""the lasses, O."" Not that we can hear too much of them in their"
1722,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"relation to each other, to men, and to life. The ""too much"" I indicate is"
1723,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"the too much of romantic love, that leaves no place for other emotions and"
1724,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"other passions equally worthy, or relegates these to an inferior position"
1725,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,and to a narrower territory. I should say that there is rather too much of
1726,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"the sentimental note in Byron, in Shelley, in Keats, just as I should say"
1727,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,that there is not too much of it in Wordsworth or in Scott. To say this is
1728,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"not to decry Byron, Shelley, and Keats--what lover of poetry would dream"
1729,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,of decrying such splendid poets as they?--but only to indicate a certain
1730,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,tendency against which I cannot help feeling it is well to be on our
1731,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"guard. The tendency of the times is to encourage writers, whether in prose"
1732,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"or verse, to deal with this particular theme and to deal with it too"
1733,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"frequently and too pertinaciously. Moreover, there is always a danger that"
1734,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"a subject, in itself so delicate, should not be quite delicately"
1735,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"handled, and indeed that it should be treated with indelicacy and"
1736,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"grossness. That, too, unfortunately, has happened in verse; and when"
1737,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"that happens, then I think the Heavenly Muse veils her face and weeps. It"
1738,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,must have been through some dread of poetry thus dishonouring itself that
1739,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Plato in his ideal Republic proposed that poets should be crowned with
1740,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"laurel, and then banished from the city. For my part, I would willingly"
1741,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"see such poets banished from the city, but not crowned with laurel. No"
1742,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,doubt Plato's notion that poets should chant nothing but hymns to the Gods
1743,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"and praises of virtue is a little narrow and exacting, but if they are to"
1744,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"sing songs worthy of themselves, and of mankind, they must be on the side"
1745,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,of virtue and of the Gods. Hark with what perfect delicacy a masculine
1746,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,poet like Scott can deal with a feminine theme:
1747,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1748,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,What though no rule of courtly grace
1749,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"To measured mood had trained her pace,"
1750,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"A foot more light, a step more true"
1751,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Ne'er from the heath-flower dashed the dew.
1752,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Ev'n the light harebell raised its head,"
1753,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Elastic from her airy tread.
1754,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,What though upon her speech there hung
1755,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,The accents of the mountain tongue?
1756,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Those solemn sounds, so soft, so clear,"
1757,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,The listener held his breath to hear.
1758,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1759,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,That is how manly poets write and think of women. But they do not dwell

1782,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,one do better than recall this perfect lyric of Wordsworth's?--

1785,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Then Nature said, ""A lovelier flower"

1828,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"She died, and left to me"

1830,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"The memory of what has been,"
1831,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,And never more will be.
1832,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1833,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Neither should I like it to be supposed that I think Byron could not write
1834,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,on this same theme in the noblest manner. He did so frequently; he would
1835,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"not have been the great poet he is if he had not done so. Listen to this,"
1836,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,for example:
1837,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1838,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"She walks in beauty, like the night"
1839,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Of cloudless climes and starry skies,"
1840,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,And all that's best of dark and light
1841,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Meet in her aspect and her eyes.
1842,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Thus mellowed to that tender light
1843,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Which Heaven to gaudy day denies.
1844,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1845,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"One shade the more, one ray the less,"
1846,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Had half impaired the nameless grace
1847,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Which waves in every raven tress,"
1848,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Or softly lightens o'er her face,"
1849,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Where thoughts serenely sweet express
1850,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"How pure, how dear, their dwelling place."
1851,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1852,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,"
1853,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,"
1854,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"The smiles that win, the tints that glow,"
1855,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"But tell of days in goodness spent,"
1856,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"A mind at peace with all below,"
1857,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,A heart whose love is innocent.
1858,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,
1859,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,Women are honoured and exalted when they are sung of in that manner. They
1860,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"are neither honoured nor exalted, they are dishonoured and degraded, when"
1861,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"they are represented, either in prose or verse, as consuming their days in"
1862,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"morbid longings and sentimental regrets, and men are represented as having"
1863,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,nothing to do save to stimulate or satisfy such feelings. What is written
1864,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"in prose is not here my theme. I am writing of poets and poetry, and of"
1865,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,the readers of poetry. Novelists and novel-readers are a different and
1866,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,separate subject. But I may say in passing that poetry and the readers of
1867,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,poetry have suffered somewhat during the present generation from novels
1868,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,and novel-readers. A newer and narrower standard of human interest has
1869,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,been set up; and while the great bulk of readers have turned from poetry
1870,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"to prose romances, writers of verse have too frequently tried to compete"
1871,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"with novelists, by treating love as the central interest and the main"
1872,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"business of life. Homer did not think it such, neither did Virgil, nor"
1873,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"Dante, nor Chaucer, nor Spenser, nor Shakespeare, nor Milton, and let us"
1874,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"not think so. I urge every one, every now and again at least, to lay down"
1875,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,the novel and open the poem: but let it be a poem that will enlarge one's
1876,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"conception of life, that will help one to think loftily, and to feel"
1877,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"nobly, will teach us that there is something more important to ourselves"
1878,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"even than _ourselves_, something more important and deserving of attention"
1879,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"than one's own small griefs and own petty woes, the vast and varied"
1880,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"drama of History, the boundless realm of the human imagination, and the"
1881,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,tragic interests and pathetic struggles of mankind. We need not close our
1882,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"ear to the feminine note, but should not listen to it over much. The"
1883,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,masculine note is necessarily dominant in life; and the note that is
1884,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,"dominant in life should be dominant in literature, and, most of all, in"
1885,THE FEMININE NOTE IN ENGLISH POETRY,poetry.

1896,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"birth of Milton. The earliest was held, with peculiar appropriateness, at"
1897,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Christ College, Cambridge, in the month of June. In the hall of the"
1898,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"college was given a dinner, presided over by the Master, who had gathered"
1899,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"round him men holding high positions alike at Cambridge and Oxford, and"
1900,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"poets, scholars, artists, historians, and essayists of true distinction."
1901,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,On this occasion an admirable eulogium of Milton was pronounced by Mr.
1902,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Mackail. The dinner was succeeded by a representation of _Comus_ in the
1903,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"theatre of the town, by the students of the University, with all the charm"
1904,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,that usually accompanies the efforts of competent amateurs. With the
1905,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,advent of the exact date of the tercentenary the celebrations were many in
1906,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"number and interesting in variety, in which the members of the British"
1907,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Academy took a prominent part. On December 9 a musical celebration was
1908,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"held in the afternoon in the church of St. Mary-le-Bow, at which the"
1909,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Bishop of Ripon delivered an eloquent sermon; and at the same hour the
1910,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"writer of this paper gave a private lecture before the Dante Society, from"
1911,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,the notes of which this article is expanded. In the evening he had the
1912,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"honour of attending and responding to the toast of Poetry, proposed by the"
1913,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Italian ambassador, at the banquet given by the Lord Mayor of London at"
1914,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"the Mansion House, to the largest and most impressive gathering of men of"
1915,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"eminence in letters, the arts, the drama, the law, and the Legislature,"
1916,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,that has ever met in that spacious hall of traditionally magnificent
1917,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,hospitality. A week later a performance of _Samson Agonistes_ was given in
1918,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,the Burlington Theatre before a large and representative audience. The
1919,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"more serious section of the daily press, moreover, allotted much space to"
1920,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"reports of the celebrations in honour of Milton, the _Times_ maintaining"
1921,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,in this respect its best traditions.
1922,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
1923,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"No one, therefore, can say that the birth, the poetry and prose, the"
1924,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,character and the career and the influence of Milton have not been
1925,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"solemnly celebrated by his countrymen. But it is necessary to add, in the"
1926,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"interests of truth, that the celebrations were essentially and exclusively"
1927,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"scholarly, and were hardly, if at all, shared in by the nation at large."
1928,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"The intellectual sympathies of the educated were warmly touched, but the"
1929,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,heart of the British people was not reached.
1930,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
1931,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Now let us turn--for the subject of this paper is not Milton alone, but"
1932,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Milton and Dante--to the sexcentenary of the birth of Dante in the city of
1933,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Florence, the month and year of his birth having been May 1265. I had been"
1934,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"spending the winter in the City of Flowers, and I could not leave it, in"
1935,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"order to journey northward, till after the Dante Commemoration had been"
1936,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,held. I shall never forget it. From dawn to dusk the entire Florentine
1937,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"people held joyous festival; and, with the coming of night, not only the"
1938,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"entire city, its palaces, its bridges, its Duomo, its Palazzo Vecchio,"
1939,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"that noblest symbol of civic liberty, but indeed all its thoroughfares and"
1940,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,the banks of its river broke into lovely light produced by millions of
1941,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"little cressets filled with olive oil, and every villa round was similarly"
1942,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,illuminated. The pavement of the famous square of the Uffizi Palace was
1943,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,boarded over; and overhead was spread a canvas covering dyed with the
1944,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,three Italian national colours. Thither thronged hundreds of peasant men
1945,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"and women, who danced and made merry till the early hours of the morning."
1946,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,At the Pagliano Theatre were given _tableaux vivants_ representing the
1947,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"most famous episodes in the _Divina Commedia_, Ristori, Salvini, and Rossi"
1948,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,reciting the corresponding passages from that immortal poem.
1949,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
1950,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"What a comparison, what a contrast it suggests between the solemn,"
1951,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"serious, but limited honour done by us to Milton, and the exultant,"
1952,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"universal, national honour paid by his countrymen to Dante! I should add"
1953,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,that eight thousand Italian municipalities sent a deputation carrying
1954,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"their local pennons to the square of Santa Croce, where a statue of Dante"
1955,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"was unveiled, amid thunderous applause, to popular gaze."
1956,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
1957,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Now let us turn to a more personal contrast between the two poets. To many
1958,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"persons, probably to most in these days, the most interesting feature in"
1959,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"the life of a poet is his relation to the sex that is commonly assumed,"
1960,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"perhaps not quite correctly, to be the more romantic of the two. In"
1961,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,comparing Dante and Milton in that respect one is struck at once by the
1962,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"fact that, while with Dante are not only associated, but inseparably"
1963,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"interwoven, the name and person of Beatrice, so that the two seem in our"
1964,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"minds but one, knit by a spiritual love stronger even than any bond"
1965,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"sanctioned by domestic law for happiness and social stability, Milton had"
1966,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,no Beatrice. It would be idle to contend that the absence of such love has
1967,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"not detracted, and will not continue to detract, from the interest felt in"
1968,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Milton and his poetry, not perhaps by scholars, but by the world at large,"
1969,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"and the average lover of poetry and poets. For just as women can do much,"
1970,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"to use a phrase of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, towards ""making a poet out"
1971,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"of a man,"" so can they do even more, either by spiritual influence or by"
1972,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"consummate self-sacrifice, to widen the field and deepen the intensity of"
1973,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,his fame. No poet ever enjoyed this advantage so conspicuously as Dante.
1974,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,It will perhaps be said that this was effected more by himself than by
1975,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"her. Let us not be too sure of that. In Italy, far more than in northern"
1976,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"climes, first avowals of love are made by the eyes rather than by the"
1977,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"tongue, by tell-tale looks more than by explicit words. What says"
1978,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Shakespeare, who knew men and women equally well?"
1979,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
1980,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon
1981,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Than love that would seem hid. Love's night is noon.
1982,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
1983,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Dante's own account of his first meeting with Beatrice confirms this
1984,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"surmise. This is what he himself says, after Beatrice, as Boccaccio"
1985,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"relates, ""very winning, very graceful, in aspect very beautiful,"" had"
1986,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"turned her gaze on Dante from time to time at their first meeting. ""At"
1987,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,that moment the spirit of life which abides in the most secret chamber of
1988,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"the heart began to tremble, and tremulously it spake these words, 'Behold"
1989,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"a god stronger than I, who cometh to lord it over me.'"" These may perhaps"
1990,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,seem strange words in which to record the first meeting of a boy of nine
1991,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"with a girl of eight. But, over and above the fact that they are the"
1992,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"record, written several years later, of the feeling aroused by that first"
1993,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"meeting, allowance must be made for the proverbial precocity of genius,"
1994,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,and also for that of southern over northern temperaments. Its genuineness
1995,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"is confirmed by the whole sequel, as testified by the _Vita Nuova_ and the"
1996,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,_Divina Commedia_; the presiding presence of Beatrice in both having long
1997,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"before been anticipated by the words, ""If it shall please Him, by whom all"
1998,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"things live, to spare my life for some years longer, I hope to say that of"
1999,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"her which never yet hath been said of any lady."" How completely that hope"
2000,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,was attained is to be seen in the closing canto of the _Purgatorio_ and in
2001,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,the whole of the _Paradiso_.
2002,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2003,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,The life and poetry of Milton contain nothing (if exception be made of his
2004,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"beautiful and lofty sonnet, written in the very spirit of the _Divina"
2005,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Commedia_, on his second wife, ""Methought I saw my late espousèd Saint"")"
2006,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"to compare with Dante's love, at once real and ideal, masculine yet"

2012,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"God is thy law, thou mine--"
2013,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2014,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,and the very choice of a subject the dominating incident of which is
2015,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"described by the well-known words, ""The woman did give me, and I did eat,"""
2016,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"would almost seem to indicate that Milton's conception of woman, and his"
2017,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"attitude towards her, were such as can be attributed to no other poet. It"
2018,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"is the attitude of unqualified masculine domination. Again, in _Samson"
2019,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Agonistes_ the very centre and pith of the poem is the incorrigible
2020,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"frailty and inferiority of women--a thesis that would be extraordinary,"
2021,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"even if true, for a poet. Samson starts with a reproval of himself for"
2022,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,weakly revealing the secret of his strength to the persistent subtlety of
2023,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"a woman, ""that species monster, my accomplished snare,"" as he calls"

2041,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Nor can it be said that Milton is here, like Shakespeare, speaking only"
2042,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,dramatically and objectively. The Chorus in _Samson Agonistes_ is of his

2064,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2065,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,that love and a gracious gentle heart are one and the same thing; and in
2066,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"the _Paradiso_, shortly before the close of the poem, he exclaims:"
2067,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2068,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,O Beatrice! dolce guida e cara.
2069,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2070,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,It may perhaps be thought that one might be more lenient towards Milton's
2071,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"foibles, especially at such a time as the present, in contrasting his"
2072,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,attitude towards woman with that of Dante. But in Milton there was so much
2073,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"that was noble, so pathetic, and even so attractive, that he can well"
2074,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,afford to have the truth told concerning him; and to omit his view of the
2075,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"most important of all personal relations in life, as depicted for and"
2076,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"bequeathed to us in his poetry, would be to leave an obvious gap of the"
2077,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,utmost import in comparing and contrasting him with Dante.
2078,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2079,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"But now let us ask, in order to redress the balance, what has Dante to"
2080,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"show, in kind, against _Il Penseroso_, _L'Allegro_, _Lycidas_, and"
2081,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,_Comus_? I put the prose works of both poets aside; and there remains on
2082,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"the side of Dante only the self-same Dante from first to last, the Dante"
2083,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"of the _Vita Nuova_ and the _Divina Commedia_. Milton, as a poet, had, on"
2084,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"the contrary, a brilliant, an attractive, and a poetically productive"
2085,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"youth. If Dante ever was young in the same sense, he has left no trace of"
2086,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"it in his poetry. Save for Beatrice, there is an austerity even in the"
2087,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"most tender passages of his verse. He seems never to relax in his gravity,"
2088,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,I had almost said in his severity. His very love for Florence is
2089,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"expressed, for the most part, in harsh upbraiding. An unrelenting awe"
2090,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,dominates his poetry. For Virgil he entertains a humble far-off reverence.
2091,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,There is no poet of whom it can be so truly said that he remained
2092,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"unchanged from first to last, and presents to us only one aspect"
2093,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,throughout his works. In reading the English poet one finds oneself in the
2094,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"presence of two Miltons, not unlike each other in the splendid quality of"
2095,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"the verse, but profoundly differing in tone, temperament, and outlook on"
2096,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"life. In the author of _L'Allegro_, _Il Penseroso_, _Lycidas_, and"
2097,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"_Comus_ there is a youthful buoyancy, an all-pervading cheerful"
2098,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"seriousness worthy of one complacently but justly confident of his powers,"
2099,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"in no degree at war with the world, but on amicable terms with it, and"
2100,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"regarding life on the whole, and on its human side, as a thing to"
2101,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,sympathise with and enjoy. Hear the young Milton's invitation to vernal
2102,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,exultation and joy:
2103,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2104,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"But come, thou goddess fair and free,"
2105,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"In heaven yclept Euphrosyne,"
2106,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"And, by men, heart-easing Mirth,"
2107,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Whom lovely Venus, at a birth,"
2108,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"With two sister Graces more,"
2109,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,To ivy-crowned Bacchus bore;
2110,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Or whether (as some sages sing)
2111,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"The frolic wind that breathes the spring,"
2112,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Zephyr, with Aurora playing,"
2113,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,As he met her once a-Maying;
2114,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"There, on beds of violets blue,"
2115,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"And fresh-blown roses wash'd in dew,"
2116,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Fill'd her with thee, a daughter fair,"
2117,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"So buxom, blithe, and debonnair."
2118,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2119,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,What is there in Dante to compare with that? There is much by way of
2120,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"contrast, but no note anywhere in his verse so generous, so exhilarating,"
2121,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"so thoroughly human. And this is how Milton, in the April of his days,"
2122,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,continues:
2123,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2124,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Haste thee, nymph, and bring with thee"
2125,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Jest, and youthful jollity,"
2126,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Quips, and cranks, and wanton wiles,"
2127,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Nods, and becks, and wreathed smiles,"
2128,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Such as hang on Hebe's cheek,"
2129,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,And love to live in dimple sleek;
2130,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Sport that wrinkled Care derides,"
2131,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,And Laughter holding both his sides.
2132,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Come and trip it, as you go,"
2133,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,On the light fantastic toe;
2134,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,And in thy right hand lead with thee
2135,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"The mountain nymph, sweet Liberty;"
2136,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"And, if I give thee honour due,"
2137,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Mirth, admit me of thy crew,"
2138,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"To live with her, and live with thee,"
2139,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,In unreprovëd pleasures free.
2140,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2141,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"And what, in the yet happy and in no degree morose Milton, are the"
2142,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"""unreproved pleasures""? They are:"
2143,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2144,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"To hear the lark begin his flight,"
2145,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"And, singing, startle the dull night,"
2146,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"From his watch-tower in the skies,"
2147,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Till the dappled dawn doth rise;
2148,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Then to come, in spite of sorrow,"
2149,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"And at my window bid good-morrow,"
2150,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Through the sweet-briar, or the vine,"
2151,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Or the twisted eglantine;
2152,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"While the cock, with lively din,"
2153,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Scatters the rear of darkness thin,"
2154,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"And to the stack, or the barn-door,"
2155,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Stoutly struts his dames before:
2156,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Oft listening how the hounds and horn
2157,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Cheerly rouse the slumbering morn,"
2158,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"From the side of some hoar hill,"
2159,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Through the high wood echoing shrill.
2160,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2161,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Where is the stern Puritan Milton in these cheerful, generous verses?"
2162,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Where the detester and active enemy of the Cavaliers in the lines that
2163,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"follow, dwelling proudly on the"

2167,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2168,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,the homes of the hereditary gentlemen of England? And think of the lines
2169,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"""Then to the spicy nut-brown ale,"" down to ""The first cock his matin"
2170,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"rings."" They are almost Shakespearean in their sympathy with mirth and"
2171,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"laughter, their enjoyment of harmless practical jokes, their boundless"
2172,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,indulgence to human nature. And what is the conclusion of the poem?
2173,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2174,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"These delights if thou canst give,"
2175,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Mirth, with thee I mean to live."
2176,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2177,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,There exists in no language a more lyrical outburst inspired by the

2182,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"that Dante ever wrote, and you will come across no such spring-like note"
2183,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"as this. Frequently he is tearful, tender, pathetic, and paternally"

2187,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Gradually, however, there stole over the younger Milton a great, a grave"
2188,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,change. His domestic experiences with his first wife could not have
2189,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,ministered to his happiness or content; experiences partly caused by the
2190,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"somewhat worldly ideals and desires of his spouse, but still more,"
2191,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"perhaps, by his theory that what the husband bids it is the duty of the"

2196,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"prose, and to the controversial side of prose. Being of a dogmatic"
2197,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"temperament, he quickly became involved in the acerbities of political,"
2198,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"theological, and ethical polemics. For a time he employed his"
2199,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,uncompromising pen on what seemed to be the winning side. But the aims of
2200,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"the ruling party in the Commonwealth were not then, any more than they are"
2201,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"now, in harmony with the main character and ideals of the English people;"

2203,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,indicated by his previous actions as an object for Anglican and Royalist
2204,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,retaliation. The buoyant elasticity of youth had subsided in him; even the
2205,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"generous vigour of early manhood had vanished; and he found himself, in"
2206,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"advanced middle life, disappointed and disheartened. The natural austerity"
2207,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,of his character and principles deepened with his new situation and
2208,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"changed outlook. He had fallen, as he thought, on evil days and evil"
2209,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"tongues; and, scandalised by the sensual levity of the King's Court and"
2210,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"favourites, he pondered with almost exultant and vindictive retrospect on"
2211,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Adam and Eve's first disobedience and its fruits, and devoted his severe"

2214,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"The Milton of these later years was bowed down by many family vexations,"
2215,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"some of them due, no doubt, to his own exacting character and ideas. He"
2216,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,was baffled and beaten in the political field where he had been so doughty
2217,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"a combatant, and for a time a triumphant one, and was finally deprived of"
2218,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"all hope of regaining his pristine position; and last, and saddest of all,"

2234,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Clear spring, or shady grove, or sunny hill,"

2276,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"local politics of Florence, which led to his exile, he too was fighting"
2277,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"for liberty, in the sense in which I have just expressed it, it is not"
2278,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,possible for a dispassionate person to hold a confident opinion. In all
2279,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"probability liberty, as we understand the word, was struggled for and"
2280,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"understood neither by him nor by those who drove him into exile. But, like"
2281,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Milton, he bore his ostracism with manly dignity, consoling himself and"
2282,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"enriching posterity with a splendid poem, and only craving for safe"
2283,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"shelter and peace, as he said at the monastery gate: _Son' uno che implora"
2284,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,pace_.
2285,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2286,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,In comparing Milton and Dante one might justly be reproached for an
2287,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"obvious omission if one did not refer, however briefly, to the intense"
2288,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"love of both for music. Very recently Mr. W. H. Hadow, than whom no one"
2289,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"writes with more knowledge or sympathy of music, lectured before the Royal"
2290,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Society of Literature on Milton's love and knowledge of it. Music, he"
2291,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"truly said, was Milton's most intimate of delights; and he referred to"
2292,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,what Johnson relates of the poet's constantly playing on the organ. In the
2293,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"second canto of the _Purgatorio_ Dante recognises the musician Casella,"
2294,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"hails him as ""Casella mio,"" and begs him who on earth had soothed Dante's"
2295,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"soul with music to do the same for him now. Casella obeys, and Dante says"
2296,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,it was done so sweetly that he can hear him still; words that recall
2297,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Wordsworth's lovely couplet:
2298,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2299,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,The music in my heart I bore
2300,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Long after it was heard no more.
2301,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2302,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"To my great surprise an eminent man of letters, who is also a poet, said"
2303,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,to me recently that the present writer was one of the few writers of verse
2304,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"he knew who loved music, and who continually asked for music, more music,"
2305,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"adding that poets, as a rule, did not care for it. I was amazed, and cited"
2306,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Shakespeare and Milton as a matter of course, and many a lesser poet,"
2307,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"against so untenable a thesis, concluding with the opening lines of"
2308,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,_Twelfth Night_:
2309,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2310,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"If music be the food of love, play on."
2311,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Give me excess of it.
2312,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2313,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Surely music is not only the food of love, but of poetry as well; and do"
2314,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"not ""music and sweet poetry agree""?"
2315,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2316,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Another point of similarity between Milton and Dante is their total lack
2317,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"of humour, so strange in two great poets, and one of them an Englishman."
2318,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Chaucer is continually on the edge of boisterous laughter. Spenser seems
2319,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"constantly on the verge of a well-bred smile. Shakespeare, to use his own"
2320,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"language, asks to be allowed with mirth and laughter to play the fool,"
2321,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,though the most gravely thoughtful and awfully tragic of all poets. The
2322,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,author of _Childe Harold_ is likewise the author of _The Vision of
2323,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Judgment_ and _Don Juan_. Scott is one of the greatest of British
2324,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,humorists. But on the face of neither Dante nor Milton do we find the
2325,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,trace of a smile either coming or gone.
2326,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2327,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"The Rev. Lonsdale Ragg, in his searching and erudite work, _Dante and his"
2328,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Italy_, maintains the opposite view at p. 190 _sqq._ But I, at least, find"
2329,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,him on this head unconvincing. None of the passages in Dante to which he
2330,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"refers would satisfy the definition of humour as employed by Sterne,"
2331,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Steele, Addison, or Charles Lamb, and cited by Thackeray in his delightful"
2332,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"papers on _The English Humorists_. Dante is scornful, satirical,"
2333,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,merciless; humorous he never is. Nor is Milton. They meet on the common
2334,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,ground of uncompromising seriousness.
2335,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2336,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Another parallel I will presume to draw between Dante and Milton is one of
2337,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"supreme importance; but I can do so only briefly. No man, in my humble"
2338,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"opinion, has the full requisites of a poet of the highest order unless at"
2339,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,some period or another of his life he has been associated by practice and
2340,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,direct experience with other men in matters of public interest. Milton and
2341,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Dante alike had that experience. So had Chaucer, so had Spenser, so had"
2342,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Shakespeare, so had Byron. They were men of the world, and did not, as"
2343,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Matthew Arnold said of Wordsworth, ""avert their gaze from half of human"
2344,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"fate."" I am aware that the opposite view is assumed in much criticism"
2345,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,to-day; and the highest rank is claimed for poetic recluses who write only
2346,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"of individual joys, sorrows, and emotions, their own mostly, and manifest"
2347,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,a complete want of concern in the wide issues of mankind. That was not a
2348,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"standard of criticism till our own time; nor will it, I believe, be the"
2349,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"standard of future ages. Dante and Milton both satisfy the older standard,"
2350,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,the older and the more abiding one.
2351,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2352,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,No comparison of Dante with Milton would be complete that omitted
2353,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"consideration of the respective themes of their chief works, their two"
2354,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"great epic poems, the _Divina Commedia_ and _Paradise Lost_. I am disposed"
2355,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"to think, though others may think differently, that Dante has in this"
2356,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,respect a signal advantage over Milton. If any one is curious to see how a
2357,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"man of great parts, but in some respects of rather insular views, can fail"
2358,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"to understand the theme of the _Divina Commedia_, and Dante's treatment of"
2359,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"it, he has only to turn, as Mr. Courthope did in his address to the"
2360,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"British Academy, to Macaulay's essay on Milton, where Dante is written of"
2361,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,as though he were nothing but a great Realist. Many years ago I suggested
2362,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"as a definition of poetry, and have more than once urged the suggestion,"
2363,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"that it is ""the harmonious transfiguration of the Real into the Ideal by"
2364,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"the aid of elevating imagination,"" so that, when the poet has performed"
2365,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"that operation, his readers accept the ideal representation as real, that"
2366,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"surest test of the greatness of a poet, provided his theme itself be"
2367,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,great. The _Divina Commedia_ stands that test triumphantly; and the result
2368,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"is that Dante makes credible, even to non-believers while they read the"
2369,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"poem, the central conception and beliefs of medieval Christianity, which"
2370,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,are still those of Roman Catholic Christianity. Hence they remain real
2371,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,facts for the transfiguring idealism of poets to deal with.
2372,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2373,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Can the same be said of _Paradise Lost_? What is ""real"" does not depend on"
2374,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"the arbitrary choice of any one, but on the _communis sensus_, the general"
2375,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"assent of those to whom the treatment of the assumed ""real"" is addressed."
2376,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Is that any longer so in the case of _Paradise Lost_? Are the personality
2377,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"of the devil, the insurrection of Lucifer and the rebel angels, and their"
2378,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"condemnation to eternal punishment, with power to tempt mortals to do that"
2379,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"which will lead to their sharing that punishment, now believed in by any"
2380,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"large number of Christian Englishmen or English-speaking Christians, or is"
2381,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,it ever likely again to be so believed in? I must leave the question to be
2382,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"answered by every one for himself. But on the answer to it, it is obvious,"
2383,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"the realistic basis of _Paradise Lost_ depends. If the reply be negative,"
2384,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,then what remains is the magnificence of the imagery and the sonority of
2385,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,the diction. To extol the one over the other in these respects would
2386,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,indeed be invidious. It is enough to place them side by side to manifest
2387,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,their equality. If Milton writes:
2388,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2389,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Him the Almighty Power
2390,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Hurled headlong flaming from the ethereal sky
2391,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,With hideous ruin and combustion down
2392,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"To bottomless perdition, there to dwell"
2393,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"In adamantine chains and penal fire,"
2394,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Who durst defy the Omnipotent to arms;
2395,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2396,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Dante writes:
2397,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2398,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Diverse lingue, orribili favelle,"
2399,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Parole di dolore, accenti d'ira,"
2400,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Voci alte e fioche, e suon di man con elle,"
2401,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Facevan un tumulto, il qual s'aggira"
2402,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Sempre in quell' aria senza tempo tinta,"
2403,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Come l'arena quando il turbo spira.
2404,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2405,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Withal, it would show imperfect impartiality if one failed to allow that"
2406,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,there is more variety in the _Divina Commedia_ than in _Paradise Lost_.
2407,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Milton never halts in his majestic journey to soothe us with such an
2408,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"episode as that of Paolo Malatesta and Francesca da Rimini, or closes it"
2409,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,with so celestial a strain as that describing the interview of Dante with
2410,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Beatrice in Heaven.
2411,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2412,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,No third poet in any nation or tongue could be named that equals Dante and
2413,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"Milton in erudition, or in the use they made of it in their poetry. The"
2414,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,present writer is himself too lacking in erudition to presume to expatiate
2415,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"on that theme. Others have done it admirably, and with due competency. But"
2416,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"on this ground, common to them both, I reluctantly part with them. To each"
2417,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"alike may be assigned the words of Ovid, _Os sublime dedit_, and equally"
2418,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"it may be said of both, that, in the splendid phrase of Lucretius, they"
2419,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"passed beyond the _flammantia moenia mundi_. Finally, each could truly"
2420,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,"say of himself, in the words of Dante,"
2421,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,
2422,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,Minerva spira e conducemi Apollo.
2423,MILTON AND DANTE: A COMPARISON AND A CONTRAST,

2431,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2432,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2433,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,The present age can hardly be reproached either with an absence of
2434,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,admirers or with a lack of self-complacency. Even its most fervid
2435,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"flatterers, however, ever and anon admit that it exhibits a few trifling"
2436,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,defects; and among these is sometimes named a diminution of popular
2437,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,interest in poetic literature. Some have attributed this decline to one
2438,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"cause, some to another; but the fact can hardly be disputed. The Heavenly"
2439,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Muse is suffering a partial eclipse. The gross and material substance of
2440,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the earth has somehow got between her and the Soul, that source and centre"
2441,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,of her gentle light; and some enthusiasts aver that with the progress of
2442,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Science and the production at will of its precise and steadfast lights,"
2443,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,fitful luminaries of night may henceforth be dispensed with. But spiritual
2444,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"eclipses, though not to be predicted with the accuracy with which physical"
2445,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"eclipses are foretold, and though unfortunately they endure for longer"
2446,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"periods, are equally transitory; and the nineteenth century was scarcely"
2447,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"original, nor will its successor prove to be correct, in fancying that the"
2448,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,garish and obedient flame of material philosophy will prove a satisfactory
2449,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"substitute for the precious, if precarious illumination of the Spirit."
2450,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2451,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Among the causes that have contributed to divert popular affection and
2452,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"popular sympathy from poetical literature, there are three that deserve to"
2453,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,be specially indicated. The first of these is the multiplication of prose
2454,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"romances, which, though so much lower in literary value and in artistic"
2455,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"character than poetry, and so much less elevating in their tendency, are"
2456,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"better fitted to stimulate the vulgar imagination, and minister more"
2457,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,freely to the common craving for excitement. The second cause is the
2458,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,reaction that has settled upon mankind from the fervid hopes inspired by
2459,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,the propagation of those theories and the propounding of those promises
2460,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,which the historian associates with the French Revolution. All saner minds
2461,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,have long since discovered that happiness is to be procured neither for
2462,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,the individual nor for the community by mere political changes; and the
2463,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"discovery has been distinctly hostile to literary enthusiasm. Finally,"
2464,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"many poets, and nearly all the critics of poetry, in our time, seem"
2465,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,determined to alienate ordinary human beings from contact with the Muse.
2466,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,The world is easily persuaded that it is an ignoramus; and the vast
2467,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"majority of people, after being told, year after year, that what they do"
2468,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"not understand is poetry, and what they do not care one straw about is the"
2469,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"proper theme and the highest expression of song, end by concluding that"
2470,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poetry has become a mystery beyond their intelligence, a sort of"
2471,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,freemasonry from whose symbols they are jealously excluded. Unable to
2472,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,appreciate what the critics tell them are the noblest productions of
2473,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"genius, they modestly infer that between genius and themselves there is no"
2474,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,method of communication; and incapable of reading with pleasure the poetry
2475,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"they are assured ought to fill them with rapture, they desist from reading"
2476,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,poetry altogether. They have not the self-confidence to choose their own
2477,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poets and select their own poetry; and indeed in these days, the only"
2478,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,chance any writer has of being read is that he should first be greatly
2479,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"talked about. Thus, what between the poets who are talked about by"
2480,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"so-called experts, and thus made notorious, but whom ordinary folks find"
2481,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"unreadable, and the poets, if there be any such, whom ordinary folks would"
2482,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"read with pleasure if they knew of their existence, but of whom they have"
2483,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"scarcely heard, poetry has become ""caviare to the general,"" who content"
2484,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"themselves with the coarser flavour of the novel, and the more easily"
2485,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,digested pabulum of the newspaper.
2486,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2487,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"But if poetry is now comparatively little read, no one can deny that it is"
2488,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,much written about; and many persons would perhaps see in the second of
2489,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,these facts a reason for doubting the reality of the first. But the
2490,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,contradiction is only apparent. Poetry is the subject at present of much
2491,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"prose criticism, prose exposition, and prose controversy; but the"
2492,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"controversialists are largely the poets themselves, or those who aspire to"
2493,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the title. The subject is treated by them with much earnestness, indeed"
2494,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,with some little heat; and it is easy to perceive that the main object of
2495,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,most of the disputants is to establish the superiority of the poet whom
2496,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the critic himself most admires, and possibly whom he himself most"
2497,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,resembles. The controversy rages around those poets alone who are claimed
2498,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"by the nineteenth century, and practically, these are five in number;"
2499,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Byron, Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, and Wordsworth. Each of these has his"
2500,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"votaries, his disciples, his passionate advocates. The public look on, a"
2501,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"little bewildered; for who is to decide when doctors disagree? Few, if"
2502,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"any, of the disputants lay down explicit canons respecting poetry, which"
2503,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,may enable a competent bystander to play the part of umpire even to his
2504,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"own satisfaction; and he is left, like the controversialists themselves,"
2505,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"to abide by his own personal tastes, and to estimate poets and poetry"
2506,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,according to his individual fancy.
2507,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2508,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,It was therefore with no slight satisfaction one heard that one of our
2509,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poets, who is likewise a critic, but who brings to his criticisms"
2510,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"moderation of language and measure of statement, was about to appraise the"
2511,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"English poets who have written in this century, but who have for many"
2512,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"years joined the Immortals. To Mr. Matthew Arnold, if to any one amongst"
2513,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"us, may be applied the passage from Wordsworth, to be found in the"
2514,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"""Supplementary Essay"" published in 1815:"
2515,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2516,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Whither then shall we turn for that union of qualifications which
2517,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,must necessarily exist before the decisions of a critic can be of
2518,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,absolute value? For a mind at once poetical and philosophical; for a
2519,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,critic whose affections are as free and kindly as the spirit of
2520,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"society, and whose understanding is severe as that of dispassionate"
2521,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,government? Where are we to look for that initiatory composure of
2522,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,mind which no selfishness can disturb; for a natural sensibility that
2523,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"has been tutored into correctness, without losing anything of its"
2524,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"quickness; and for active faculties, capable of answering the demands"
2525,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"which an author of original imagination shall make upon them,"
2526,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,associated with a judgment that cannot be duped into admiration by
2527,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"aught that is unworthy of it? Among those, and those only, who, never"
2528,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,having suffered their youthful love of poetry to remit much of its
2529,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"force, have applied to the consideration of the laws of this art the"
2530,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,best power of their understandings.
2531,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2532,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"To Mr. Arnold, if to any, we say, this enumeration of the qualities"
2533,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"indispensable to a trustworthy critic of poetry, may be applied; and if"
2534,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,the conclusions at which he bids us to arrive should not turn out to be
2535,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"such as we can wholly accept, at least we shall have the satisfaction of"
2536,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,feeling that we dissent from one who has not invited our attention in
2537,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"vain, and who perhaps, by the avowals he incidentally makes in the course"
2538,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"of his argument, has enabled us to hold with all the more confidence"
2539,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,certain opinions which we will endeavour to establish by independent
2540,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,reasons of our own.
2541,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2542,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Here, with sufficient brevity for the present, is the conclusion of Mr."
2543,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Arnold on the vexed question of the primacy among English poets, no longer"
2544,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"living, of the last century:"
2545,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2546,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"I place Wordsworth's poetry above Byron's, on the whole, although in"
2547,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"some points he was greatly Byron's inferior. But these two,"
2548,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Wordsworth and Byron, stand, it seems to me, first and pre-eminent in"
2549,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"actual performance, a glorious pair, among the English poets of this"
2550,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"century. Keats had probably, indeed, a more consummate poetic gift"
2551,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,than either of them; but he died having produced too little and being
2552,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,as yet too immature to rival them. I for my part can never ever think
2553,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,of equalling with them any other of their contemporaries; either
2554,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Coleridge, poet and philosopher wrecked in a mist of opium; or"
2555,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Shelley, beautiful and ineffectual angel, beating in the void his"
2556,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,luminous wings in vain. Wordsworth and Byron stand out by themselves.
2557,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"When the year 1900 is turned, and our nation comes to recount her"
2558,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poetic glories in the century which has just then ended, the first"
2559,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,names with her will be these.
2560,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2561,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,We do not propose to traverse the entire field of controversy here lightly
2562,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,indicated; our purpose being to confine ourselves to a consideration of
2563,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Mr. Arnold's particular conclusion, that Wordsworth's poetry should be"
2564,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"placed above Byron's. But before passing to that duty, we may say,"
2565,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"parenthetically, that though we agree with Mr. Arnold that Shelley's"
2566,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poetry often exhibits a lamentable ""want of sound subject-matter,"" the"
2567,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"claims of the ""beautiful and ineffectual angel"" are here somewhat"
2568,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"summarily dismissed; and that when Mr. Arnold says further that he ""doubts"
2569,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"whether Shelley's delightful Essays and Letters, which deserve to be far"
2570,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"more read than they are now, will not resist the wear and tear of time"
2571,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"better, and finally come to stand higher than his poetry,"" he makes us"
2572,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"lift our eyes in sheer amazement, and somewhat more than doubt whether"
2573,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,this will not prove to be among the utterly falsified prophecies of very
2574,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,able critics.
2575,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2576,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Holding the opinion he does concerning Wordsworth and Byron, Mr. Arnold"
2577,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"has published a selection from the works of both, in distinct and separate"
2578,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"volumes, and he believes that he has thereby rendered an equal service to"
2579,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"each. ""Alone,"" he writes, ""among our poets of the earlier part of this"
2580,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"century, Byron and Wordsworth not only furnish material enough for a"
2581,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"volume of this kind, but also, it seems to me, they both of them gain"
2582,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"considerably by being thus exhibited."" We, on the contrary, submit that if"
2583,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the comparison is to end here, and is to be confined to the results"
2584,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"produced by Mr. Arnold's method, a more unjust and inadequate method, as"
2585,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"far as Byron is concerned, could not possibly be resorted to. Wordsworth"
2586,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"gains considerably, but Byron loses considerably, to employ Mr. Arnold's"
2587,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"language, by being thus exhibited. No doubt, Mr. Arnold means to be just."
2588,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,He always means to be just. But in the very description he gives of the
2589,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"contents of these two volumes on their respective title-pages, does he not"
2590,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,betray a sort of unconscious consciousness that he is dealing with two
2591,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"very different poets, and with two poets whose works are very different?"
2592,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"If this be not so, how comes it that he calls one volume _""Poems"" of"
2593,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Wordsworth_, and the other _""Poetry"" of Byron_? The distinction is a"
2594,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"genuine one. Indeed, it is something more than genuine; it was inevitable,"
2595,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"and Mr. Arnold was obliged to make it, if the title of each volume was to"
2596,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"describe its contents correctly. The best poems of Wordsworth are short,"
2597,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"most of them remarkably short; and therefore, in a volume of selections"
2598,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"from his works, they can without difficulty be presented in their"
2599,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"integrity. The best poems of Byron, like the best poems of Æschylus, of"
2600,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Virgil, of Dante, of Shakespeare, of Milton, are of considerable length;"
2601,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"and if selections from Byron are to be made, his best poems must be"
2602,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,mutilated for the purpose. Mr. Arnold has mutilated them accordingly.
2603,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Thus, while intending to treat Wordsworth and Byron in precisely the same"
2604,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"manner, he has treated them, and by the very conditions of the case could"
2605,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"not help treating them, in an entirely different manner."
2606,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2607,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"That Mr. Arnold has not been altogether insensible to this objection--and,"
2608,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"indeed, with his calm and dispassionate penetration, he was not likely to"
2609,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,be--is apparent not only in the different description he gives of the
2610,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"contents of the two volumes, on their respective title-pages, but from"
2611,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,certain observations in his prefatory essay upon Byron. When he says that
2612,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"""there are portions of Byron's poetry which are far higher in worth, and"
2613,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"far more free from fault than others,"" or that ""Byron cannot but be a"
2614,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"gainer by having attention concentrated upon what is vivid, powerful,"
2615,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"effective, in his work, and withdrawn from what is not so,"" he is, we"
2616,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"would suggest, stating nothing more than a truism, or what is equally true"
2617,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"of every poet. He is only beating the air, and hesitating to close with"
2618,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,the real difficulty with which he feels himself confronted. But when he
2619,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"proceeds to urge that ""Byron has not a great artist's profound and patient"
2620,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"skill in combining an action or in developing a character,--a skill which"
2621,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"we must watch and follow if we are to do justice to it,"" he shows that he"
2622,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,feels it to be necessary to offer a defence for applying to Byron a
2623,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"treatment from which Byron may possibly suffer. We confess, with all our"
2624,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,admiration for Mr. Arnold--and it is as deep as it is sincere--we have
2625,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,never been able to resist the suspicion that he is _tant soit peu_ a
2626,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"sophist; and surely it is sophistry, in the course of an attempt to show"
2627,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"that Byron and Wordsworth each equally gain by the ""selection"" method of"
2628,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"treatment, to urge, with that air of tranquil and well-bred triumph of"
2629,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"which Mr. Arnold is so consummate a master, that ""to take passages from"
2630,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"work produced as Byron's was, is a very different thing from taking"
2631,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,passages out of the _Oedipus_ or the _Tempest_ and deprives the poetry
2632,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"far less of its advantage""? For the question is not whether Sophocles,"
2633,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Shakespeare, and Byron may be treated ostensibly in the same manner by an"
2634,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"editor of selections, without injustice being done to any of them, but"
2635,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,whether Wordsworth and Byron can. That is the question; and it is not
2636,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"answered, but avoided, by altering the terms of the proposition."
2637,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2638,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"What, therefore, really remains of this plea of Mr. Arnold's, this excuse"
2639,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"for mutilating Byron's poems and presenting them in fragments, is the"
2640,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"allegation that Byron is not, _above and before all things_, a great,"
2641,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"patient, and systematic artist. That much may be granted; and no competent"
2642,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,critic would deny it. But more cannot be granted than is strictly true;
2643,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,and candour equally demands that it should be admitted that though Byron
2644,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,was not long-suffering and far-reaching enough in the conception of his
2645,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poems, nor careful and self-critical enough in their execution, he"
2646,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,possessed at least enough of the instinct and the scope of the artist to
2647,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"produce works that cohere with themselves, and that have a unity of design"
2648,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,sufficiently definite to mark it as something distinct from the mere
2649,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,succession of executed detail. Will Mr. Arnold seriously pretend that a
2650,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"more ""vivid, powerful, and effective"" impression is not created upon the"
2651,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"mind by a perusal of the whole of _Manfred_, than by a perusal of portions"
2652,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"of it, or of one or two dissociated Acts? Mr. Arnold turns Byron's own"
2653,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"modest confessions against himself, and lays stress upon the avowal that"
2654,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the _Giaour_ is ""a string of passages."" But if any one were, after due"
2655,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"reflection, to maintain, that more justice is done to Byron by reading"
2656,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"some of its passages than by reading the whole of the poem, we confess we"
2657,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,should be obliged to entertain some doubt as to his own instincts as an
2658,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"artist. For, where men like Byron are concerned, it is peculiarly true"
2659,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"that the divinity of the Muse shapes their ends, rough-hew these how they"
2660,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"may. Of every one of Byron's tales--the _Siege of Corinth_, _The Bride of"
2661,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Abydos_, _Parisina_--this is equally true. It has more than once been"
2662,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,observed that _Childe Harold_ suffers from the fact that a period of eight
2663,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"years elapsed between the composition of the first and second cantos, and"
2664,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the composition of the third and fourth; and as far as style is concerned,"
2665,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the contrast is very striking, two of the cantos being for the most part"
2666,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"almost as feeble, and two of them as forcible, as anything deserving the"
2667,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"name of poetry well can be. Nevertheless, there would be no difficulty in"
2668,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"showing, and we think no reader of poetry endowed with a fair amount of"
2669,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"artistic sense would require to be shown, that a certain oneness of"
2670,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"purpose and unity of drift presides over and accompanies the entire poem,"
2671,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"in a word that it is substantially homogeneous; and if any one, after"
2672,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"reading through the third and fourth cantos at a stretch, as we recently"
2673,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"did, were to tell us that he thought a few extracts from each give an"
2674,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"adequate conception of the two, and that reading portions is in effect"
2675,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"equivalent to reading the whole, we should have reached that limit of"
2676,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,controversy which is expressed by a silence that is not assent. It is true
2677,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,that Mr. Arnold has been fairly lavish in his extracts from _Childe
2678,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Harold_; yet out of the 300 stanzas which compose the third and fourth
2679,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"cantos, his selection contains only 114, or little more than a third. But"
2680,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"it is not only by the curtailment of the quantity, but by the treatment"
2681,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"applied to what is selected, that injury is done to _Childe Harold_. The"
2682,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"passages quoted are scattered at intervals through the volume, so that all"
2683,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,consecutiveness and coherence are lost. The majestic march of the poem is
2684,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,utterly broken. The subtle argument that lurks in the order of every
2685,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poem--whether it be the _lucidus ordo_ of a speech, or an order less"
2686,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,obvious and patent--is completely destroyed. The strain neither begins nor
2687,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"ends, neither rises nor falls, neither pauses nor progresses. The statue"
2688,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"is shivered to pieces, and we are offered a collection of chips, mixed up"
2689,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,with fragments from other marbles that have been treated with equal
2690,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"ruthlessness. Here there is a hand, here a portion of a foot, here a"
2691,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"section of the features, here a bit of the torso. They still are"
2692,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"magnificent, and full of suggestiveness. But are they equal and equivalent"
2693,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,to the entire statue? Are they as good as the whole of the original work?
2694,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,With surprising paradox Mr. Arnold assures us they are considerably
2695,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,better.
2696,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2697,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"This singular conclusion is attained, it seems to us, by the excessive"
2698,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"assertion, or at least by the exaggerated application, of a theory in"
2699,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"which there is, unquestionably, a solid element of truth. We have said"
2700,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,that Byron is not an austere and consistent artist. But that is not to
2701,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"affirm that he is not an artist at all; whereas, in thus treating his"
2702,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"productions fragmentarily, Mr. Arnold acts as though such an assertion"
2703,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"were true. Byron, says Mr. Arnold, is not ""architectural."" But is he not?"
2704,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"There is architecture, and architecture; the severe and systematic"
2705,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"architecture of the Greeks, and the more free, irregular, unmethodical"
2706,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"architecture which we know as Gothic. In the conception, and what in"
2707,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"technical parlance is called the composition, of his works, Byron is"
2708,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,assuredly no Greek. The exquisite oneness of design characteristic of
2709,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Athenian genius he certainly did not borrow from the land and the race no
2710,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,one has so splendidly extolled. But if we turn to some of the noblest
2711,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"productions of Gothic architecture, what do we find? We find Cathedrals of"
2712,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"unquestioned beauty and of universal fame, produced, it would"
2713,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"superficially seem, almost haphazard; without design, without plan, even"
2714,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"without architect. In our own land we may see Minsters that, begun in the"
2715,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"eleventh, were not finished till the fifteenth century. Like _Childe"
2716,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Harold_, they bear the evident marks of different ages, and of different"
2717,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"styles; and like _Don Juan_, they show that they were commenced without"
2718,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"their parent knowing where or how they were to end. Nay, like it again,"
2719,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,some of them remain unfinished to this day. But will any one affirm that
2720,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"their integrity, as they stand, is nothing to them, and nothing to us?"
2721,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Because no great master-conception presided over their origin and their
2722,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"execution, will no injury be done to them by taking them to pieces, and"
2723,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"saying, ""Here is a lovely apse; here you see a beautiful flying buttress;"
2724,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,here contemplate an exquisite rood-screen; here you have an admirable bit
2725,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"of the choir, and there a glorious specimen of the roof""?"
2726,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2727,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Nor can it be urged that this illustration does violence to the process
2728,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Mr. Arnold has adopted. On the contrary, the analogy is not strong enough;"
2729,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"for _Manfred_, _The Corsair_, _Cain_, _Childe Harold_ itself, were"
2730,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"conceived and executed, not less, but far more homogeneously, than the"
2731,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"edifices with which we have compared them, and if it would be unjust and"
2732,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"inadequate to treat Gothic cathedrals after this fashion, it is still more"
2733,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,unjust and inadequate to treat Byron's poems after this fashion. More
2734,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"glaring still becomes the injustice, and more utter the inadequacy, when"
2735,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,we remember in whose company he is so treated. Mr. Arnold does not break
2736,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Wordsworth's poems to pieces and present us with the fragments; for there
2737,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"is no necessity to do so. The long ones Mr. Arnold cheerfully throws over,"
2738,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"confessing that _The Excursion_ ""can never be a satisfactory work to the"
2739,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"disinterested lover of poetry,"" and even that Jeffrey was not wrong when"
2740,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"he said of it, ""This will never do."" To adhere to our metaphor, it is a"
2741,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,large comfortless Meeting-house; and so is the _Recluse_. The best of
2742,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Wordsworth's poems, as we have said, and as Mr. Arnold says, are his short"
2743,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"ones. There are charming English cottages, or, if it be preferred--for we"
2744,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"have no intention of decrying them, we admire them vastly--exquisite"
2745,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"little wayside chapels; and they fit conveniently into the space, without"
2746,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"being tampered with, which Mr. Arnold has provided for them. But the best"
2747,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,of Byron's poems are the long ones; are vast Gothic edifices that soar
2748,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"high into the air and cover a vast amount of ground, and therefore cannot"
2749,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,be compressed into the same compass. We have seen how Mr. Arnold gets over
2750,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the difficulty. He pulls them down, places bits and sections of them side"
2751,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,by side with the untouched cottages and still complete oratories of
2752,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Wordsworth, and asks us to compare the two. We are far from saying that,"
2753,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"even under these conditions, the comparison ends to Byron's disadvantage."
2754,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,But it surely must be evident to every one that the conditions are not
2755,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"equal, and therefore, however fair were the intentions of the editor, that"
2756,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,they are not really just. We should be sorry if any one supposed we
2757,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"consider Mr. Swinburne as sound a critic as Mr. Arnold. But, upon this"
2758,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"particular question, Mr. Swinburne has propounded a conclusion against"
2759,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"which, we submit, Mr. Arnold contends in vain. ""The greatest of Byron's"
2760,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"works was his whole work taken together."" Nothing could be more terse or"
2761,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,more true; and if Mr. Swinburne would be content always to form his
2762,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"judgments thus calmly and comprehensively, and to express them with this"
2763,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"brevity and directness, he would soon come to exercise an authority which"
2764,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,is at present refused by many to his literary verdicts.
2765,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2766,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"But though, if the comparison instituted between Byron and Wordsworth by"
2767,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Mr. Arnold were to be confined within the conditions he has imposed on
2768,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"both alike, great injustice would be done to Byron, it may well be doubted"
2769,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,if the plan adopted by Mr. Arnold will really tend to Byron's
2770,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"disadvantage. On the contrary we suspect that, with the best will in the"
2771,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"world to do all he can for Wordsworth, Mr. Arnold has done him rather an"
2772,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"ill turn. For the whole, or anything approaching to the whole, of the best"
2773,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"of Byron, is not to be found in the volume of selections edited by Mr."
2774,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Arnold; and everybody will feel that Byron is a far greater poet than he
2775,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,could possibly be made to appear by any such method. But all the best
2776,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,poetry of Wordsworth is in the volume Mr. Arnold dedicates to him; and we
2777,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,entertain little doubt that there is no dispassionate critic who would not
2778,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"be obliged to allow that a considerable portion, indeed we fear the"
2779,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"greater portion of it, is not poetry at all. The process Mr. Arnold has"
2780,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"applied to Wordsworth, will have to be applied over again, and with"
2781,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"greater rigour. He has rejected as ""not satisfactory work to the"
2782,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"disinterested lover of poetry,"" an immense quantity of what Wordsworth"
2783,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,conceived to be such. Another editor will have to reject a considerable
2784,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,proportion of what Mr. Arnold has too indulgently included. His selection
2785,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"will have to be selected from afresh; and thus, with doubtful"
2786,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"friendliness, he has pointed and prepared the way for some entirely"
2787,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"dispassionate critic who will leave of Wordsworth only what, to ""the"
2788,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"disinterested lover of poetry,"" is worth leaving; and this unfortunately,"
2789,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"though of a high and delightful quality, will prove to be comparatively"
2790,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"little. In a word, to do Byron anything like justice, we require several"
2791,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"volumes of the size of that Mr. Arnold devotes to him; we require, in"
2792,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"fact, most of what he wrote. To do Wordsworth justice, we require a volume"
2793,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"less than half the size of what Mr. Arnold gives us; we require, in fact,"
2794,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,to suppress at least three-fourths of what he wrote.
2795,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2796,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"But, again, we can raise no question, and propound no conclusion which Mr."
2797,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Arnold, with his penetrating sense and acute susceptibility, has not"
2798,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"himself more or less discerned. After observing, ""we must be on our guard"
2799,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"against Wordsworthians,"" he thus writes, in a vein of delicate humour:"
2800,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2801,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,I have spoken lightly of Wordsworthians: and if we are to get
2802,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Wordsworth recognised by the public and by the world, we must"
2803,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"recommend him not in the spirit of a clique, but in the spirit of"
2804,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,disinterested lovers of poetry. But I am a Wordsworthian myself. I
2805,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"can read with pleasure and edification _Peter Bell_, and the whole"
2806,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"series of _Ecclesiastical Sonnets_, and the addresses to Mr."
2807,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Wilkinson's spade, and even the _Thanksgiving Ode_; everything of"
2808,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Wordsworth, I think, except _Vaudracour and Julia_. It is not for"
2809,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,nothing that one has been brought up in the veneration of a man so
2810,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"truly worthy of homage; that one has seen and heard him, lived in his"
2811,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"neighbourhood, and been familiar with his country."
2812,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2813,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Alas! even the best of us are mortal; and we accept this graceful passage
2814,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"as Mr. Arnold's confession that he, too, is a Wordsworthian against whom"
2815,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,we must be on our guard. An extremist of a school he could not now be; but
2816,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"""it is not for nothing,"" as he says, that he was trained in it. ""Once a"
2817,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"priest,"" says an Italian proverb, ""always a priest""; and, we fear, once a"
2818,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Wordsworthian, always a Wordsworthian. It is no reproach; but ""we must be"
2819,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"on our guard."" For our part, we are tolerably familiar with Wordsworth's"
2820,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"country, but, beyond that, we are under no such spell as Mr. Arnold"
2821,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,confesses to above. We entertain profound veneration and homage for
2822,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Wordsworth, but it is the result, not so much of early teaching--the most"
2823,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,difficult of all lessons to unlearn--as of independent admiration and
2824,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"sympathy inspired in riper years. We, too, can read _Peter Bell_ and the"
2825,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"_Ecclesiastical Sonnets_, but with more edification than pleasure; and we"
2826,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"have read, afresh, every word of what Mr. Arnold has included in his"
2827,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"_Poems of Wordsworth_, only to reach the conclusion we have already"
2828,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"stated, that from many, only too many of them, the spirit, the essence,"
2829,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the indefinable something, of poetry is absent."
2830,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2831,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"We should be sorry to be thought guilty of dogmatism, and there is always"
2832,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"peril in generalisations. Let us therefore descend to particulars, as far"
2833,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"as space will permit, and analyse the contents of Mr. Arnold's _Poems of"
2834,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Wordsworth_. The volume consists of 317 pages; of which 20 are dedicated
2835,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"to ""Poems of Ballad Form,"" 92 to ""Narrative Poems,"" 56 to ""Lyrical Poems,"""
2836,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"34 to ""Poems akin to the Antique and Odes,"" 32 to ""Sonnets,"" and 83 to"
2837,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"""Reflective and Elegiac Poems."""
2838,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2839,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"In the first division, _We are Seven_, _Lucy Gray_, and _The Reverie of"
2840,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Poor Susan_, are the only poems that can be pronounced wholly"
2841,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"satisfactory, and that give real pleasure. _Anecdote for Fathers_ and"
2842,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"_Alice Fell_ would be just as well away, for they would raise the"
2843,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"reputation of no poet, save it be with those against whom ""we must be on"
2844,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"our guard."" The poems, _The Childless Father_, _Power of Music_, and"
2845,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"_Star-Gazers_, are redeemed only by their moral; and perhaps of _Power of"
2846,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Music_, even this cannot be said."
2847,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2848,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"An Orpheus! an Orpheus!--yes, Faith may grow bold,"
2849,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,And take to herself all the wonders of old;--
2850,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Near the stately Pantheon you'll meet with the same
2851,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,In the street that from Oxford hath borrowed its name.
2852,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2853,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"His station is there;--and he works on the crowd,"
2854,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,He sways them with harmony merry and loud;
2855,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,He fills with his power all their hearts to the brim--
2856,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Was aught ever heard like his Fiddle and him?
2857,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2858,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,What an eager assembly! what an empire is this!
2859,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"The weary have life, and the hungry have bliss;"
2860,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"The mourner is cheered, and the anxious have rest;"
2861,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,And the guilt-burthened soul is no longer opprest.
2862,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2863,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Then follow eight stanzas, in which the baker, the apprentice, the"
2864,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"newsman, the lamplighter, the porter, the lass with her barrow, the"
2865,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"cripple, the mother, and others, are described as stopping to listen, in"
2866,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,language similar to that of the three stanzas we have quoted; the only
2867,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"slight improvement upon it being such lines as ""She sees the Musician,"
2868,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"'tis all that she sees,"" until we reach the conclusion:"
2869,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2870,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Now, coaches and chariots! roar on like a stream;"
2871,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Here are twenty souls happy as souls in a dream:
2872,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"They are deaf to your murmurs, they care not for you,"
2873,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Nor what ye are flying, nor what ye pursue."
2874,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2875,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,The more ardent admirers of Wordsworth are in the habit of assuming that
2876,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,those persons who approach their favourite poet with a more hesitating
2877,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"homage, fail to appreciate the beauty of simplicity, and fancy that a"
2878,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,composition is not poetical because it lacks what is called elevation of
2879,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"language and the ""grand style."" We can assure them, in all sincerity, that"
2880,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,far from that being the basis of our inability to admire all that they
2881,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"admire, we admire Wordsworth most, and we admire him immensely, when he is"
2882,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"as simple as it is possible to be. We have just cited a poem, which we"
2883,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"scarcely think deserves that name. But, side by side with it, in Mr."
2884,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Arnold's volume, is a much shorter composition, on precisely the same"
2885,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"theme, which is, if possible, still more simple in treatment, but which is"
2886,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"true poetry, if true poetry was ever written. It is called _The Reverie of"
2887,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Poor Susan_:
2888,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2889,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"At the corner of Wood Street, when daylight appears,"
2890,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Hangs a thrush that sings loud, it has sung for three years:"
2891,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Poor Susan has passed by the spot, and has heard"
2892,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,In the silence of morning the song of the Bird.
2893,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2894,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,'Tis a note of enchantment; what ails her? She sees
2895,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"A mountain ascending, a vision of trees;"
2896,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Bright volumes of vapour through Lothbury glide,"
2897,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,And a river flows on through the vale of Cheapside.
2898,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2899,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Green pastures she views in the midst of the dale,"
2900,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Down which she so often has tripped with her pail;
2901,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"And a single small cottage, a nest like a dove's,"
2902,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,The one only dwelling on earth that she loves.
2903,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2904,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"She looks, and her heart is in heaven; but they fade,"
2905,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"The mist and the river, the hill and the shade:"
2906,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"The stream will not flow, and the hill will not rise,"
2907,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,And the colours have all passed away from her eyes.
2908,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2909,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"After reading _The Reverie of Poor Susan_, we may pay Wordsworth's Muse"
2910,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,the compliment that was paid by the Latin poet to the woman who was
2911,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,_simplex munditiis_. Its neat simplicity is in great measure the secret of
2912,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"its success; but it is not mean in its simplicity. Neither, as in the"
2913,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"other poems we have contrasted with it, have we to wait till the end of"
2914,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,the poem for the moral and the meaning. The moral is interwoven and
2915,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"interfused with it, and every line breathes the soul and essence of the"
2916,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"entire composition. But nearly all these ""Poems of Ballad Form"" are"
2917,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"didactic; and does not Mr. Arnold tell us, in his preface, ""Some kinds of"
2918,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,poetry are in themselves lower kinds than others; the ballad kind is a
2919,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"lower kind; the didactic kind, still more, is a lower kind""? Of the twenty"
2920,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"pages of these poems of lower kind, we are strongly disposed to think that"
2921,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the ""disinterested lover of poetry"" would discard twelve, and retain only"
2922,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"eight, and that Wordsworth, to use Mr. Arnold's phrase, would ""stand"
2923,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"higher"" if this were done."
2924,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2925,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,But even this proportion between retention and rejection cannot well be
2926,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,maintained by the disinterested lover of poetry as he advances through the
2927,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"volume. The ""Narrative Poems"" occupy nearly a third of it, and in this"
2928,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,section the amount of real poetry is meagre indeed. We had no conception
2929,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"how many short poems Wordsworth had written, unredeemed by ""the gleam, the"
2930,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"light that never was, on sea or land,"" till we read this collection"
2931,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"consecutively; and we read it in the open air, in a beautiful country, on"
2932,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,the loveliest day of a lovely May. But nothing could possibly attune the
2933,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,heart of the disinterested lover of poetry to such verses as these:
2934,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2935,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"When Ruth was left half desolate,"
2936,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Her father took another mate;
2937,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"And Ruth, not seven years old,"
2938,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"A slighted child, at her own will"
2939,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Went wandering over dale and hill,"
2940,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"In thoughtless freedom, bold."
2941,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2942,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,There came a Youth from Georgia's shore--
2943,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"A military casque he wore,"
2944,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,With splendid feathers drest;
2945,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,He brought them from the Cherokees;
2946,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"The feathers nodded in the breeze,"
2947,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,And made a gallant crest.
2948,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2949,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"""Belovèd Ruth!"" No more he said."
2950,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,The wakeful Ruth at midnight shed
2951,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,A solitary tear:
2952,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,She thought again--and did agree
2953,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"With him to sail across the sea,"
2954,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,And drive the flying deer.
2955,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2956,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"""And now, as fitting is and right,"
2957,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"We in the Church our faith will plight,"
2958,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"A husband and a wife."""
2959,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Even so they did; and I may say
2960,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,That to sweet Ruth that happy day
2961,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Was more than human life.
2962,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2963,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Not only is it impossible, we think, for the disinterested lover of poetry"
2964,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"to read this either with pleasure or with edification, but it is not easy"
2965,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"for him to read it without an ever-broadening smile. As a rule, the verse"
2966,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,to be met with in our less fastidious Magazines is not of a very high
2967,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,order. But we doubt if the editor of any one of them would consent to
2968,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"insert the foregoing stanzas, or those that follow, with their, ""But as"
2969,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"you have before been told,"" ""Meanwhile, as thus with him it fared, They"
2970,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"for the voyage were prepared,"" ""God help thee, Ruth! Such pains she had,"
2971,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"That she in half a year was mad,"" and such like specimens of unartistic"
2972,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"and naive childishness. Surely, if there be any one who thinks this"
2973,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poetry, it must be Mr. Arnold's friend, the British Philistine? If"
2974,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Murdstone and Quinion could be converted and ever took to reading poetry,"
2975,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,would not this be the sort of verse that would delight them? And would
2976,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"they not do so by reason of that ""stunted sense of beauty,"" and that"
2977,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"""defective type"" of intellect with which Mr. Arnold justly reproaches the"
2978,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,English middle-class?
2979,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2980,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Did these poems stand alone, in their prosaic puerility, we might be"
2981,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,surprised that Mr. Arnold had reproduced them; but we should have been
2982,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"content to conclude that, like Homer, both poet and editor had been"
2983,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"nodding. But we turn page after page of these ""Narrative Poems"" to be"
2984,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,astonished by what we encounter. The next poem to _Ruth_ is _Simon Lee:
2985,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"The Old Huntsman, with an Incident in which he was Concerned_:"
2986,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2987,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Few months of life has he in store,"
2988,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"As he to you will tell,"
2989,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"For still, the more he works, the more"
2990,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Do his weak ankles swell.
2991,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"My gentle Reader, I perceive"
2992,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"How patiently you've waited,"
2993,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,And now I fear that you'll expect
2994,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Some tale will be related.
2995,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
2996,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,O Reader! had you in your mind
2997,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Such stores as silent thought can bring,"
2998,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,O gentle Reader! you would find
2999,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,A tale in everything.
3000,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"What more I have to say is short,"
3001,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,And you must kindly take it:
3002,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"It is no tale; but, should you _think_,"
3003,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Perhaps a tale you'll make it.
3004,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3005,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Simon is grubbing the stump of a tree, but was unequal to the task. The"
3006,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poet takes the mattock from his hand, and with a blow severs the root, ""At"
3007,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"which the poor Old Man so long, And vainly had endeavoured."" Thankful"
3008,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"tears come into his eyes, whereupon the poet remarks:"
3009,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3010,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"I've heard of hearts unkind, kind deeds"
3011,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,With coldness still returning;
3012,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Alas! the gratitude of men
3013,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Hath oftener left me mourning.
3014,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3015,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"The sentiment is nice and pretty, but is it poetry, or, even if it were,"
3016,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,could it make poetry of the doggerel--for surely there really is no other
3017,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,name for it--that precedes it? And do Wordsworthians against whom Mr.
3018,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Arnold tells us we ought to be on our guard, or Wordsworthians who fancy"
3019,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"that we need not be on our guard against _them_, suppose that moralising"
3020,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"correctly and piously in verse about every ""incident"" in which somebody"
3021,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"happens to be ""concerned,"" renders the narrative a ""tale,""--much more,"
3022,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"makes poetry of it? We are far from saying that Wordsworth might not, in a"
3023,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"happier mood, have written poetry upon this particular incident. But we do"
3024,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"say, with some confidence, that he has unfortunately not done so; that the"
3025,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"incident, narrated in the manner in which he has narrated it, cannot of"
3026,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"itself be accepted as poetry--which, as Mr. Arnold well knows, is the"
3027,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"extreme Wordsworthian theory, as advocated by Wordsworth himself in pages"
3028,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,upon pages of controversial prose; and that we are greatly astonished Mr.
3029,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Arnold should indirectly lend it countenance, by reprinting and stamping"
3030,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"with his precious approval, such infelicitous triviality as the above. We"
3031,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"cannot shrink from saying this, through an unworthy dread lest we should"
3032,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"be confounded with ""the tenth-rate critics and compilers to whom it is"
3033,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"still permissible to speak of Wordsworth's poetry, not only with"
3034,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"ignorance, but with impertinence."" Mr. Arnold has himself shown that he"
3035,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,does not hesitate to speak in pretty strong terms of those portions of
3036,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Wordsworth's verse which he does not regard as poetry. He describes them
3037,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"as ""abstract verbiage""; he acknowledges that they are so inferior, it"
3038,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,seems wonderful how Wordsworth should have produced them; and in a passage
3039,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,delightfully humorous he imagines a long passage of Wordsworth being
3040,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,declaimed at a Social Science Congress to an admiring audience of men with
3041,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"bald heads and women in spectacles, ""and in the soul of any poor child of"
3042,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"nature who may have wandered in thither, an unutterable sense of"
3043,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"lamentation, mourning, and woe."""
3044,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3045,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"All that we ask, therefore, is to be allowed the same amount of liberty"
3046,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"which Mr. Arnold himself has exercised, and to be permitted to do what he"
3047,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"has done. We, too, would fain disengage what is valuable in Wordsworth's"
3048,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poetry from what is worthless. We, too, would fain ""exhibit his best work,"
3049,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"and clear away obstructions from around it."" But we contend, and we"
3050,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"willingly leave the decision to disinterested lovers of poetry, that such"
3051,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poems as _Ruth_ and _Simon Lee_ are not only not Wordsworth's best work,"
3052,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,but not good work at all; on the contrary are part of the obstruction from
3053,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,which it should be cleared.
3054,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3055,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"The next two poems in the ""Narrative"" section refer to the fidelity of"
3056,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"dogs, and a single stanza will suffice to show that they are of much the"
3057,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,same calibre as the two that precede them:
3058,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3059,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,But hear a wonder for whose sake
3060,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,This lamentable tale I tell!
3061,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,A lasting monument of words
3062,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,This wonder merits well.
3063,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"The Dog, which still was hovering nigh,"
3064,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Repeating the same timid cry,"
3065,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"This Dog, had been through three months' space"
3066,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,A dweller in that savage place.
3067,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3068,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Next in order comes _Hart-Leap Well_, which consists of two parts. In the"
3069,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"first we come across such lines and phrases as ""Joy sparkled in the"
3070,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"prancing courser's eyes,"" ""A rout that made the echoes roar,"" ""Soon did"
3071,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the Knight perform what he had said, And far and wide thereof the fame did"
3072,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"ring,"" ""But there is matter for a second rhyme, And I to this would add"
3073,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"another tale,"" which are simply a distress to the disinterested reader of"
3074,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poetry. In the second part, the poet warms up, and ends with a passage"
3075,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,which is very beautiful:
3076,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3077,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Grey-headed Shepherd, thou hast spoken well;"
3078,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Small difference lies between thy creed and mine:
3079,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,This Beast not unobserved by Nature fell;
3080,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,His death was mourned by sympathy divine.
3081,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3082,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"The Being, that is in the clouds and air,"
3083,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"That is in the green leaves among the groves,"
3084,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Maintains a deep and reverential care
3085,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,For the unoffending creatures whom he loves.
3086,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3087,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"The Pleasure-house is dust:--behind, before,"
3088,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"This is no common waste, no common gloom;"
3089,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"But Nature, in due course of time, once more"
3090,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Shall here put on her beauty and her bloom.
3091,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3092,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"She leaves these objects to a slow decay,"
3093,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"That what we are, and have been, may be known;"
3094,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"But, at the coming of the milder day,"
3095,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,These monuments shall all be overgrown!
3096,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3097,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"One lesson, Shepherd, let us two divide,"
3098,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Taught both by what she shows, and what conceals;"
3099,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Never to blend our pleasure or our pride
3100,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,With sorrow of the meanest thing that feels.
3101,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3102,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Of course, this is poetry, and very good poetry; and it is, justly, one of"
3103,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,the favourite passages of ardent admirers of Wordsworth. But we can
3104,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"scarcely refrain from saying that, good as it is, there exists something"
3105,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"of precisely the same kind, and, as it happens, in precisely the same"
3106,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"metre, which is considerably better. Surely, no one will have any"
3107,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,difficulty in naming it. It is Gray's famous _Elegy_. Yet we remember how
3108,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"indignant the ""Wordsworthians against whom we ought to be on our guard"""
3109,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"were with the _Quarterly Review_, because there appeared in it a paper in"
3110,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,which Wordsworth and Gray were compared. To mention them in the same
3111,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,breath was sacrilege! We do not wish to affirm that the disinterested
3112,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,lover of poetry believes Gray ever to have scaled the heights where
3113,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Wordsworth's wing sometimes floats almost without effort. But it cannot be
3114,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"uninteresting to mark that, in what we may call the middle notes,"
3115,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Wordsworth is distinctly inferior to Gray, though ever and anon his voice"
3116,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,gets entirely beyond Gray's compass.
3117,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3118,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"It would be impossible, with any regard for space, to quote from, or even"
3119,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"to name, every poem reproduced by Mr. Arnold, which in our opinion would"
3120,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,have been better suppressed. But if we seem to have established our
3121,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"contention so far, we think the reader may rely upon it that he would more"
3122,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,or less concur in what else might be said on this score. _The Force of
3123,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Prayer_, _The Affliction of Margaret_, _The Complaint of a Forsaken Indian"
3124,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Woman_, are little if any less trivial than the poems already condemned;"
3125,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"while in _The Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle_, we read six pages"
3126,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"equally poor and unpoetical, suddenly to come upon such a quatrain as the"
3127,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,following:
3128,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3129,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Love had he found in huts where poor men lie;
3130,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"His daily teachers had been woods and rills,"
3131,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"The silence that is in the starry sky,"
3132,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,The sleep that is among the lonely hills.
3133,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3134,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,The last two lines it would be impossible to praise too highly. Only the
3135,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,silence of profound reverence can do them justice. They are touches like
3136,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"these, touches like ""the harvest of a quiet eye,"" that give to Wordsworth"
3137,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"his holy predominance, and whatever predominance, after fair examination,"
3138,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,must be adjudged him. But how few they are! Perhaps it is in the nature of
3139,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"things that they should be so. But being so few and far between, they"
3140,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"cannot fill up the blank that intervenes. They are indeed ""Angels'"
3141,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"visits."" But even poetry has to do mainly with human guests, and a poet"
3142,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"must be judged, as Mr. Arnold truly affirms, by ""the ample body of"
3143,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"powerful work"" he leaves behind. We cannot assume that much of"
3144,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Wordsworth's poetry is not unutterably bad, because some of it is"
3145,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"unutterably beautiful. The utmost we can do is to grant, concerning him,"
3146,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,what he himself said so finely of a young girl:
3147,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3148,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"If thou appear'st untouched by solemn thought,"
3149,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Thy nature is not therefore less divine:
3150,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Thou liest in Abraham's bosom all the year,"
3151,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"And worshipp'st at the Temple's inner shrine,"
3152,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,God being with thee when we know it not.
3153,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3154,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"It is possible that like the ""dear child, dear girl,"" he lay in Abraham's"
3155,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"bosom ""all the year,"" but he communicates the fact, he impresses us with"
3156,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the fact, but seldom. As a rule, he seems to be outside the Temple"
3157,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,altogether. Hence these magnificent bursts of poetical depth and
3158,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"sublimity, which, be it said, are peculiar to Wordsworth, are mere short"
3159,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"passages, and there are not many of them. But if they suffice, after a"
3160,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"complete survey of the works of both poets, to place Wordsworth above"
3161,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Byron, we shall be obliged to conclude that they suffice to place him"
3162,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"above every poet that ever lived. That such a theory of poetry, such a"
3163,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"canon of criticism is untenable, unless we are to cast every hitherto"
3164,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,accepted theory of poetry and every former canon of criticism to the
3165,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"winds, we trust, in due course, to be able to establish."
3166,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3167,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,We are aware that _The Brothers_ is a favourite composition with
3168,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,thoroughgoing Wordsworthians. But as we have been told to be on our guard
3169,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"against them, we need not hesitate to say that it seems to us to consist"
3170,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"of very ordinary verse, and the piece itself to be devoid of any real"
3171,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poetical temperament, though it fills sixteen pages in Mr. Arnold's"
3172,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"collection. Sixteen more are occupied by _Margaret_, upon which we are"
3173,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,unable to pronounce a different or a modified verdict. Both abound in such
3174,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,passages as the following:
3175,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3176,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"He left his house: two wretched days had past,"
3177,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"And on the third, as wistfully she raised"
3178,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Her head from off her pillow, to look forth,"
3179,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Like one in trouble, for returning light,"
3180,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Within her chamber-casement she espied
3181,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"A folded paper, lying as if placed"
3182,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,To meet her waking eyes. This tremblingly
3183,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"She opened--found no writing, but beheld"
3184,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Pieces of money carefully enclosed,"
3185,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Silver and gold. ""I shuddered at the sight,"""
3186,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Said Margaret, ""for I knew it was his hand"
3187,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Which placed it there: and ere that day was ended,"
3188,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,That long and anxious day! I learned from one
3189,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Sent hither by my husband to impart
3190,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"The heavy news,--that he had joined a Troop"
3191,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Of soldiers, going to a distant land."
3192,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,He left me thus--he could not gather heart
3193,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,To take a farewell of me; for he feared
3194,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"That I should follow with my Babes, and sink"
3195,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Beneath the misery of that wandering life."""
3196,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3197,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"If this be poetry, then poetry is very easily written, and what has"
3198,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"hitherto been supposed to be the highest, the most difficult, and the"
3199,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"rarest, of the arts, presents no more difficulty to the person who knows"
3200,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"how to write at all than the simplest, baldest, and most unartistic prose."
3201,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"What, for instance, is this?--"
3202,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3203,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"At length the expected letter from the kinsman came, with kind"
3204,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,assurances that he would do his utmost for the welfare of the boy; to
3205,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,which requests were added that forthwith he might be sent to him. Ten
3206,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,times or more the letter was read over. Isabel went forth to show it
3207,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,to the neighbours round; nor was there at that time on English land a
3208,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"prouder heart than Luke's. When Isabel had to her house returned, the"
3209,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"old man said, ""He shall depart to-morrow."" To this word the housewife"
3210,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"answered, talking much of things which, if at such short notice he"
3211,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"should go, would surely be forgotten. But at length she gave consent,"
3212,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,and Michael was at ease.
3213,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3214,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Is this prose or verse? We have printed it as prose. Wordsworth wrote it
3215,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"as verse, and Mr. Arnold has reproduced it as poetry. Had all Wordsworth's"
3216,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"compositions been of this calibre, and a painfully large number of them"
3217,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"are, well might John Stuart Mill affirm that any man of good abilities"
3218,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"might become as good a poet as Wordsworth by giving his mind to it, and we"
3219,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,will add that a man of good abilities could hardly employ them worse. Yet
3220,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"this passage, and fourteen pages of verse not one whit better than it, are"
3221,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"to be met with in _Michael_, one of the narrative poems Mr. Arnold, with"
3222,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"special emphasis, begs us to admire. ""The right sort of verse,"" he says,"
3223,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"""to choose from Wordsworth, if we are to seize his true and most"
3224,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"characteristic form of expression, is a line like this from _Michael_:"
3225,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3226,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,And never lifted up a single stone.
3227,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3228,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"There is nothing subtle in it, no heightening, no study of poetic style,"
3229,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,strictly so called; yet it is expressive of the highest and most
3230,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"expressive kind."" Of course, in order to properly appreciate it, we must"
3231,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"know the context, which fortunately is easily compressed. Michael and his"
3232,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"son Luke were to build a sheepfold; but, as told in the passage we have"
3233,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"printed, Luke is sent to a kinsman, who will advance him in life. Before"
3234,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"he goes, Michael takes him to lay the first stone of the sheepfold. The"
3235,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"lad then leaves home, falls into dissolute courses, and at last hides"
3236,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"himself beyond the seas. After that, it is narrated of Michael:"
3237,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3238,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,And to that hollow dell from time to time
3239,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Did he repair, to build the Fold of which"
3240,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,His flock had need. 'Tis not forgotten yet
3241,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,The pity which was then in every heart
3242,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,For the Old Man--and 'tis believed by all
3243,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"That many and many a day he thither went,"
3244,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,And never lifted up a single stone.
3245,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3246,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"We have asked several disinterested lovers of poetry, some of them ardent"
3247,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"admirers of Wordsworth, what they think of this; and we are bound to say"
3248,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,that most of them failed to see anything in it whatsoever. That is not our
3249,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"case. We feel the force of the situation, and the apt simplicity of the"
3250,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"concluding line. Yet repeat it, dwell on it, and surrender ourselves to it"
3251,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"as we will, we fail to persuade ourselves that it merits the lofty eulogy"
3252,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"pronounced on it by Mr. Arnold. It is with hesitation that we presume, on"
3253,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"such a point, and where the issue is so direct, to place our opinion in"
3254,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,seeming competition with his; but we can only leave the decision to the
3255,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,_communis sensus_ of disinterested lovers of poetry. But nothing--not even
3256,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Mr. Arnold's authority--could satisfy us that this line suffices to lend
3257,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,the wings of poetry to fourteen closely printed pages of such pedestrian
3258,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,verse as that of which _Michael_ for the most part consists.
3259,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3260,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"The only other poem in the ""Narrative"" section of the volume is _The"
3261,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Leech-Gatherer_; and it, besides containing many lines of admirable"
3262,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poetry, is itself a coherently beautiful poem. But when, resuming our"
3263,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"analysis, we enquire how much poetry there is in the 112 pages, or in more"
3264,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"than the third portion of the volume we have as yet examined, what do we"
3265,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"find? Exactly 20, and only 20, which we honestly believe the disinterested"
3266,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"lover of poetry, the critic to whom Mr. Arnold makes appeal, would"
3267,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,recognise as strictly deserving that description. We can seriously assert
3268,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"that this is the amount we should save from the wreck, if we were editing"
3269,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"a selection from Wordsworth, were disengaging his good work from his bad,"
3270,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,and were seeking to obtain for him readers who care nothing whatever about
3271,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"him personally, and who only wish ever and anon to steep themselves in the"
3272,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"atmosphere of native and sterling poetry. We are well aware that, from"
3273,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"another and a more extended point of view, Wordsworth never wrote a line,"
3274,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"in verse or in prose, which is not worth preserving, and worth reading."
3275,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,But that is not at present the question. We are dealing with the critical
3276,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"contention of a great and influential critic, that ""what strikes me with"
3277,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"admiration, what establishes in my opinion Wordsworth's superiority""--to"
3278,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Byron, be it understood, and to every English poet since Milton--""is the"
3279,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"great and ample body of powerful work which remains to him, even after all"
3280,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"his inferior work has been cleared away."" This it is which renders it"
3281,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"necessary to clear away the inferior work, in order that we may see if the"
3282,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"body of ""powerful"" work that remains be really ""ample"" or not."
3283,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3284,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"The ""Lyrical Poems"" contain the best, the most characteristic, and the"
3285,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"most valuable of the compositions of Wordsworth. For our part, we should"
3286,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"have excluded _To a Sky-Lark_, at page 126--not the beautiful one with the"
3287,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"same title at page 142--_Stray Pleasures_, the two poems _At the Grave of"
3288,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Burns_, _Yarrow Visited_, _Yarrow Revisited_, in spite of their vogue with"
3289,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Wordsworthians _quand même_, _To May_, and _The Primrose of the Rock_."
3290,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,There would then be left 33 pages containing the best poems _of their
3291,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"kind_ anywhere to be found, and of inestimable value to the disinterested"
3292,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"lover of poetry. The fervid lover of poetry knows them by heart, and"
3293,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,carries them with him through life. Is it necessary to give their names?
3294,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"_She was a Phantom of Delight_, _The Solitary Reaper_, _Three Years She"
3295,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Grew_, _To the Cuckoo_, _I Wandered lonely as a Cloud_--these, and their"
3296,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"companions, to be found about the middle of Mr. Arnold's volume, are among"
3297,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the most precious, and will remain among the enduring possessions of"
3298,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,mankind. Nor is it only that they fill the mind with elevating thoughts
3299,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"and swell the heart with sacred sentiments. They make one regard, with a"
3300,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"peculiar affection, the poet who wrote them. But we must not allow this"
3301,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,literary love to warp literary judgment. No such feeling is awakened for
3302,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,their authors by _Childe Harold_ or _Hamlet_. But to conclude that
3303,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Wordsworth is, therefore, a greater poet than Byron or Shakespeare, would"
3304,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,be as illegitimate in the one instance as in the other. It would be to
3305,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"imitate the filial and uxorious fondness of the late Mr. Carlyle, who"
3306,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"gravely tells us that his father had a larger intellect than Burns, and"
3307,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"that his amiable, long-suffering wife wrote letters of greater value and"
3308,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"insight than the works of George Sand and George Eliot, and ""all the pack"
3309,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"of scribbling women from the beginning of time."" To love Wordsworth is"
3310,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"pardonable; nay, it is inevitable to those who are intimate with his"
3311,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,tenderest work. But the critic must disengage his judgment from his
3312,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"affections, if he is not to mislead the persons he aspires to instruct,"
3313,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,and to injure the art of whose dignity he is bound to be jealous.
3314,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3315,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Briefly, then, and pursuing to the end the ""disinterested-lover-of-poetry"""
3316,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"method recommended to us by Mr. Arnold, and of which we think we have"
3317,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,already given illustrations to enable any one to decide for himself
3318,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"whether we pursue it with equity and candour, we reach the conclusion"
3319,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"that, of the 317 pages composing Mr. Arnold's collection, only 103, on a"
3320,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"liberal estimate, contain what is worth preserving as poetry; or at least,"
3321,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"if there be any dispute as to whether it is poetry, there can be none,"
3322,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"outside the specially Wordsworthian circle, as to its being very inferior"
3323,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poetry indeed, and in no degree calculated to confer, extend, or uphold"
3324,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,any man's reputation as a poet. That it is admirable in sentiment and
3325,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"laudable in moral purpose, may at once be granted. But the purest of"
3326,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"sentiments and the loftiest of purposes do not constitute poetry, even"
3327,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,when apparelled in verse. Indeed we may say of them what Mr. Arnold
3328,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"himself says of those portions of Wordsworth's writings which he discards,"
3329,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"that they are ""doctrine such as we hear in church, religious and"
3330,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,philosophical doctrine; and the attached Wordsworthian loves passages of
3331,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"such doctrine, and brings them forward in proof of his poet's excellence."
3332,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"But however true the doctrine may be, it has, as here presented, more of"
3333,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the characters of _poetic_ truth, the kind of truth we require from a"
3334,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poet."""
3335,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3336,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,It may possibly seem an ungracious part to dwell upon the inferior
3337,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"portions of Wordsworth work, and to play the _rôle_ of Devil's Advocate in"
3338,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,the case of one who is assured beforehand of the honours of canonisation.
3339,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,But it should be remembered that this invidious task has been imposed upon
3340,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"us by Mr. Arnold, who has asserted, and challenged contradiction to the"
3341,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"assertion, that in Wordsworth is to be found ""an ampler body of powerful"
3342,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"work,"" which constitutes his superiority over every English poet since"
3343,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Milton. It is he who has rendered it necessary, in justice to other poets,"
3344,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"to enquire with accuracy, what _is_ the amount of powerful work to be"
3345,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,found in Wordsworth; and this cannot be done without careful and judicial
3346,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"scrutiny. Our object is the same as Mr. Arnold's; not to decry Wordsworth,"
3347,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,but to ascertain his proper place in relation to other poets. If we seem
3348,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"to have spoken of him harshly, then so must Mr. Arnold; the only"
3349,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,difference between us being that he thinks a certain proportion of
3350,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Wordsworth's verse poor stuff, while we view a yet larger portion of it in"
3351,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,that light. Nor is it the example of Mr. Arnold alone that can be cited in
3352,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,exoneration of perfect outspokenness. M. Scherer is a distinguished French
3353,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"critic, whom Mr. Arnold quotes, and M. Scherer has in turn introduced Mr."
3354,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Arnold's _Selections_ from Wordsworth to the French public in the pages of
3355,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the _Temps_. He is a warm admirer of Wordsworth, and, as Mr. Arnold tells"
3356,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"us, an excessive depreciator of Byron. From him, therefore, we may, with"
3357,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"all the less scruple, cite the following avowals:"
3358,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3359,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,The simplicity of Wordsworth's subjects and manner too often
3360,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"degenerates into triviality, the simplicity of his style into"
3361,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poverty. He abuses his love for puerile anecdotes, makes us a present"
3362,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"of stories about dogs, and of recitals of what a little girl has said"
3363,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"to her sheep. He not only parades enthusiasm for flowers and birds,"
3364,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"but predilection for beggars, cripples, and idiots. The lower a"
3365,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"person is in the scale of being, the more he strives to awaken our"
3366,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"sympathy in his favour. There are no details so minute, so"
3367,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"insignificant, that he does not take a special pleasure in remarking"
3368,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"them. Is he narrating a walk he takes in summer, he will speak of"
3369,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"""the host of insects gathering round his face, and which are ever"
3370,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"with him as he paces along."""
3371,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3372,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,The habit of seeking and finding lessons in the smallest incidents of
3373,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,his walks becomes a didactic mania. He extracts moralities from every
3374,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"object, he preaches sermons at every turn. Often, too, this preaching"
3375,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,vein is far from being poetical. One sometimes seems to be listening
3376,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"to the psalm-singing of a Conventicle. This, for example, resembles a"
3377,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,hymn of Watts.
3378,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3379,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"The poetry of Wordsworth, with the tendency it always had towards the"
3380,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"prosaic, often lapses into it altogether."
3381,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3382,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"This, we submit, is only another way of saying what we have ventured to"
3383,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"say, and what Mr. Arnold himself has said. May we not reasonably conclude"
3384,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"that M. Scherer would reject at least all that we have rejected? But, in"
3385,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"any case, that there is substantial agreement between us and him, so far,"
3386,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,is evident.
3387,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3388,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"What, then, is the ""ample body of powerful work"" that is left of"
3389,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Wordsworth after the eliminating process has been applied to it by the
3390,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,disinterested lover of poetry? Between three and four thousand lines;
3391,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,rather more than the amount of matter in the third and fourth cantos of
3392,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"_Childe Harold_, rather less than the amount of matter in _Hamlet_. The"
3393,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"quantity therefore, the ""body"" of work left, is not very large. Still we"
3394,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"should not contest that it was ""ample"" enough to establish the superiority"
3395,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"of Wordsworth over Byron, if it happened to be sufficiently ""powerful"" for"
3396,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the purpose. Though quantity must count for something, even in the"
3397,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"comparison of poet with poet, since quantity implies copiousness, and"
3398,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"usually implies versatility, quality counts for much more, if the"
3399,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"difference in quality be marked, and suffices to abolish the consideration"
3400,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"of quantity altogether, if the superiority in respect of quality be"
3401,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"sufficiently great. If, for example, the four thousand lines, or"
3402,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"thereabouts, of poetry Wordsworth has written, had been embodied, say, in"
3403,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"a _Hamlet_, then work so powerful would have been ample to establish his"
3404,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"superiority not only over every English poet since Milton, but over every"
3405,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poet since the one who has left us, so to speak, several _Hamlets_."
3406,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3407,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,For what is it that renders _Hamlet_ so great and so powerful? Is it
3408,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,single lines of beautiful poetry? Is it detached passages of profound and
3409,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"elevated thought presented in poetic guise? These go for much, more"
3410,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,especially when we consider them in connection with that of which they are
3411,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the drapery. But what would they be, and what should we think of them,"
3412,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"detached from the conception of the drama itself, without the plot,"
3413,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"action, and progress of the piece, without the invention and unfolding of"
3414,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"its characters, without its varied and forcible situations, without its"
3415,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"wit, its irony, its humour? What should we think of _Hamlet_ if divested"
3416,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"of the panorama of moving human passions, of its merciless tragedy, and,"
3417,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"finally, of its utter absence of moral so complete, that moralists have"
3418,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,been for a hundred years wrangling what the moral is? These are the
3419,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"qualities, and these alone, which make great poetry and great poets."
3420,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3421,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"What has Wordsworth of all these? The answer, if candid and disinterested,"
3422,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"must be, Absolutely nothing. He has written no epic, no drama, no poem of"
3423,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,any kind in which so much as an attempt is made to deal with the clashing
3424,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"of the various passions that ""stir this mortal frame."" Of Action he is"
3425,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"utterly devoid. Of Invention, he seems absolutely unconscious. He has no"
3426,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"wit; he has no humour. He has conceived no character, he has portrayed no"
3427,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"character. If he can be said to deal with situations at all, they are of"
3428,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the simplest and most elementary kind, and he does not in any sense create"
3429,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"them. He finds them at his door. No one blames him for making use of them,"
3430,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,where he makes use of them well; but this is a very different thing from
3431,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the invention shown in _Macbeth_ or _The Tempest_, or even in _Cain_, in"
3432,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"_Manfred_, and in _The Siege of Corinth_. Sardanapalus is not a Lear, nor"
3433,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"is Myrra a Cordelia. But, as exhibitions and portraitures of human"
3434,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"character and human passion in poetry they are as much beyond _Lucy Gray_,"
3435,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"or _Michael_, or the little Child in _We are Seven_, as Lear and Cordelia"
3436,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,are beyond them in turn.
3437,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3438,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Upon this point let us again hear M. Scherer:
3439,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3440,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,We must expect from Wordsworth neither the knowledge of the human
3441,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"heart which worldly experience gives, nor that interior drama of the"
3442,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,passions which a man can describe well only on condition of having
3443,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"been their victim, nor those general views upon history and society"
3444,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"which are formed partly by study, partly by the practice of public"
3445,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,affairs. Our poet is as much a stranger to the disquietudes of
3446,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"thought as to those of ambition, to the sufferings of love and of"
3447,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,hate as to that resignation at which one arrives when one has
3448,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,discerned how very small are the great affairs of this world. He has
3449,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"nothing of that sublime melancholy, of those fervid questionings, of"
3450,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"those audacious revolts, in which poetry delighted fifty years ago."
3451,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Still less has he that mocking scepticism, that raillery now gay now"
3452,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"bitter, which succeeded the songs of despair. He will never be of"
3453,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"those who trouble souls as Byron does, who arm them with irony like"
3454,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Heine, or who calm them, like Goethe, by the virtue of true"
3455,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,understanding. Wordsworth is simply a Solitary who has long gazed
3456,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,upon Nature and much analysed his own feelings. Scarcely should we
3457,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"dare to call him a philosopher, so wanting in him is the reasoning"
3458,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,and speculative element. Even the title of thinker only half becomes
3459,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,him. He is a contemplative.
3460,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3461,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"It is true that, at the end of his review of Wordsworth, and without any"
3462,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"previous admonition that he is going to do so, M. Scherer says, in one"
3463,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"brief sentence, ""Wordsworth seems to me to come after Milton, notably"
3464,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"below him in my opinion, but withal the first after him""; thus endorsing"
3465,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the judgment of Mr. Arnold. But, unlike Mr. Arnold, he makes no attempt to"
3466,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"establish or justify this view, but throws it out, as an _obiter dictum_,"
3467,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"after writing a long essay, every argument and every phrase of which tend"
3468,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,towards a diametrically opposite conclusion. So thoroughly is this the
3469,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"case, that we can honestly say we agree with every word in his essay, with"
3470,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,the exception of the one brief sentence we have just cited.
3471,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3472,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"But in the longer and more detailed passage quoted above, is not"
3473,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"everything conceded for which we are contending? According to M. Scherer,"
3474,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Wordsworth has knowledge neither of the human heart nor of the interior
3475,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,drama of the passions. He has no broad views of history and society. He is
3476,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"a stranger to love, hatred, ambition, and the disquietudes they cause, as"
3477,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,well as to the disquietudes caused by deep thought; and not having passed
3478,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"through these, he has necessarily not ""come out upon the other side,"" and"
3479,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,is equally a stranger to the tranquillity of complete knowledge and
3480,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,complete experience. He is not a philosopher; he is hardly a thinker. He
3481,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"is a contemplative solitary, who has consorted much with woods, lakes, and"
3482,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"mountains, and has dwelt much upon the sensations they excite in himself."
3483,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Verily, this is a sorry equipment for a great poet. Is it an exaggeration"
3484,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"to say that, if all this be true, Wordsworth is destitute of most of the"
3485,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,qualities which in a great poet have hitherto been deemed indispensable?
3486,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"If, in spite of these remarkable deficiencies, he really be the greatest"
3487,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"English poet since Milton, we shall be forced to conclude that English"
3488,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poets since Milton have been far less powerful, of far lower calibre, and"
3489,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"of far less value, than has generally been supposed."
3490,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3491,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"What then is the precise value, the real calibre, the particular kind of"
3492,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"power, of that ""ampler body of powerful work"" which Wordsworth has given"
3493,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"us? We have seen it is not an epic, nor a drama, nor one great"
3494,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"comprehensive poem of any kind. It consists of lyrics, ballads, sonnets,"
3495,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,and odes; of many of which it would not be just or critical to say more
3496,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"than that they are very sweet and charming, several of which must be"
3497,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"pronounced exquisite, and a few, very few, of which may be designated"
3498,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,sublime. We own we share the general opinion that the greatest composition
3499,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,of Wordsworth is the _Ode on Intimations of Immortality_. We are surprised
3500,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,and disappointed to find Mr. Arnold speaking rather coldly of it; and M.
3501,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Scherer likewise refers to it in a depreciatory tone, though he gives"
3502,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"different reasons for his conclusion. M. Scherer thinks it ""sounds a"
3503,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"little false,"" and adds that he ""cannot help seeing in it a theme adopted"
3504,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,with reference to the poetic developments of which Wordsworth was
3505,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"susceptible, rather than a very serious belief of the author."" We confess"
3506,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"we think the judgment harsh, and the reasons given for it insufficient,"
3507,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,if not indeed irrelevant. The objection Mr. Arnold entertains for it is
3508,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"that ""it has not the character of poetic truth of the best kind; it has no"
3509,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,real solidity. The instinct of delight in Nature and her beauty had no
3510,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,doubt extraordinary strength in Wordsworth himself as a child. But to say
3511,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"that universally this instinct is mighty in childhood, and tends to die"
3512,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"away afterwards, is to say what is extremely doubtful."""
3513,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3514,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Now, with all deference to Mr. Arnold, which is due to him in a special"
3515,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"manner when he is expounding Wordsworth, Wordsworth does not say this. In"
3516,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the first place, Wordsworth, after describing the comparative and"
3517,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"temporary diminution of this instinct, describes its revival and"
3518,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,transfiguration in another guise. But what is far more important to note
3519,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"is, Wordsworth does _not_ say the instinct is universal. He is writing as"
3520,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"a poet, not as a psychologist; and though he treats of an objective infant"
3521,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"for a time, and uses the pronoun ""_our_ infancy,"" he in reality is"
3522,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"describing his own experience, and letting it take its chance of being the"
3523,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"experience of a certain number of other people. What, we may well ask, can"
3524,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"a poet do more than this, when he gets into the higher range, the upper"
3525,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"atmosphere of poetry? When Shakespeare talks of ""the shade of melancholy"
3526,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"boughs,"" he does not mean that everybody feels them to be melancholy. That"
3527,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"is the privilege--the melancholy privilege, if any one wills it so--of the"
3528,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,higher natures. That what Wordsworth describes in his splendid _Ode_ not
3529,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"only was true of himself, but is true likewise of all great poetic"
3530,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"spirits, we entertain no doubt; and it will become true of an"
3531,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"ever-increasing number of persons, if mankind is to make progress in the"
3532,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,intimate and integral union of intellectual and poetic sentiment. In our
3533,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"opinion, the highest note of Wordsworth is struck in this Ode, and"
3534,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,maintained through a composition of considerable length and of
3535,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,argumentative unity of purpose. It is struck by him elsewhere--indeed in
3536,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the lines on Hartley Coleridge, we have a distinct overture, so to speak,"
3537,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"to the Ode; but nowhere is it sustained for so long, or with such oneness,"
3538,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"definiteness, and largeness of aim. There is, perhaps, no finer poem, of"
3539,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"equal length, in any language. We could well understand any one"
3540,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,maintaining that there exists no other so fine.
3541,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3542,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"But, if this Ode be struck out of the account, what remains to represent"
3543,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"an ""ample body of powerful work""? For, after all, in criticism, if we"
3544,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"criticise at all, we must use words with some definite meaning. Perhaps"
3545,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Mr. Arnold would tell us that it is not the business of true Culture to be
3546,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,too definite; and we should heartily agree with him. One of the things
3547,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,that makes prose so inferior to poetry is its inaccurate precision. But it
3548,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"is Mr. Arnold himself who, on this occasion, compels us to be precise. He"
3549,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"has elected to compare Wordsworth with every poet since Milton, and, in"
3550,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"doing so, he has been obliged to use language which, to be of any use,"
3551,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"must be more or less definite. What is meant by ""ample""? Still more, what"
3552,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"is meant by ""powerful""? Does he mean that Wordsworth's ""Lyrical Poems,"""
3553,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"which we think to be the best of Wordsworth's compositions after the Ode,"
3554,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"and which he thinks the best, before the Ode, are ""powerful""? Let us quote"
3555,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"perhaps the best of them, already quoted elsewhere, but that can never be"
3556,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,read too often:
3557,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3558,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Behold her, single in the field,"
3559,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Yon solitary Highland Lass!
3560,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Reaping and singing by herself;
3561,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Stop here, or gently pass!"
3562,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Alone she cuts, and binds the grain,"
3563,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,And sings a melancholy strain;
3564,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,O listen! for the Vale profound
3565,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Is overflowing with the sound.
3566,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3567,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,No Nightingale did ever chaunt
3568,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,So sweetly to reposing bands
3569,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Of Travellers in some shady haunt,"
3570,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Among Arabian sands:
3571,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,A voice so thrilling ne'er was heard
3572,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"In spring-time from the Cuckoo-bird,"
3573,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Breaking the silence of the seas
3574,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Among the farthest Hebrides.
3575,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3576,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Will no one tell me what she sings?
3577,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow
3578,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"For old, unhappy, far-off things,"
3579,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,And battles long ago:
3580,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Or is it some more humble lay,"
3581,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Familiar matter of to-day?
3582,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,"
3583,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"That has been, and may be again?"
3584,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3585,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Whate'er the theme, the Maiden sang"
3586,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,As if her song could have no ending;
3587,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"I saw her singing at her work,"
3588,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,And o'er the sickle bending;--
3589,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"I listened till I had my fill,"
3590,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"And when I mounted up the hill,"
3591,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"The music in my heart I bore,"
3592,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Long after it was heard no more.
3593,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3594,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"This is exquisite; and of the sort of exquisiteness that leads one, in"
3595,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"private, and in uncritical colloquies, to fall, as the phrase runs, into"
3596,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"ecstasies. But can it, with any regard to accuracy of speech, be described"
3597,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"as ""powerful"" work? We submit that it cannot. _Lear_ is powerful. The"
3598,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,first six books of _Paradise Lost_ are powerful. The first four cantos of
3599,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,_Don Juan_ are powerful. The _Ode on Intimations of Immortality_ is
3600,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,powerful. But unless we are to lose ourselves in a labyrinth of critical
3601,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"confusion, we must no more allege or allow that _The Solitary Reaper_ is"
3602,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"powerful, than we can affirm that _Where the Bee Sucks_ is powerful, that"
3603,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Milton's sonnet, _To the Nightingale_ is powerful, or that Byron's _She"
3604,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Walks in Beauty like the Night_ is powerful. They are all very beautiful;
3605,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"but that is another matter, and it will not do to confound totally"
3606,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,different things.
3607,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3608,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"How many lyrics, as perfect as the one we have quoted, has Wordsworth"
3609,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,written? We can count but nine; and the most liberal computation could not
3610,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,extend them beyond twelve. To these would have to be added perhaps twice
3611,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"as many, very inferior to these, but still very beautiful, a certain"
3612,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"number, but a very limited number, of first-rate sonnets, the Odes we have"
3613,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"referred to, and detached lines and passages from other poems, notably the"
3614,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,passage in the poem _On Revisiting Tintern Abbey_. The result would be
3615,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,about a third of the amount we ourselves should altogether extract from
3616,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Wordsworth, and of which alone it could justly be said that some of it was"
3617,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"powerful, and all of it was very beautiful work."
3618,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3619,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"This is what, we venture to assert, remains, after rigid scrutiny, of ""the"
3620,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"ampler body of powerful work"" which Wordsworth has given us. These are the"
3621,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"compositions which, according to Mr. Arnold, ""in real poetical achievement"
3622,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"... in power, in interest, in the qualities which give enduring"
3623,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"freshness,"" establish Wordsworth's superiority."
3624,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3625,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Now can this claim possibly be allowed, unless, as we have said, all"
3626,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"previous canons of criticism, and all previous estimates of poetry are to"
3627,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"be cast to the winds? If it is to be allowed, then Æschylus, Euripides,"
3628,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Sophocles, Virgil, Dante, Shakespeare, must come down from their"
3629,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"pedestals, and be regarded by us with very different eyes from those with"
3630,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"which we have hitherto scanned them. For what are the marks, what the"
3631,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"qualities, which have distinguished these poets above their fellows, and"
3632,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,by reason of which the world has extolled their genius? It is not merely
3633,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"for poetic diction, for tenderness of sentiment, for elevation of feeling,"
3634,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"for apt simile, appropriate metaphor, illuminating imagery, and the play"
3635,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"of fancy as exhibited in subordinate detail, that we estimate them as we"
3636,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"do. Neither is it, as we have already pointed out, but as we must repeat,"
3637,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"for detached passages of sublimity, nor yet for short poems of exquisite"
3638,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"beauty, that they have been assigned the rank they occupy. They occupy"
3639,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"that rank by reason of their great conceptions, by reason of their"
3640,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,capacity to project long and comparatively complex poems dedicated to a
3641,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"lofty theme, and to conduct these through all their intricate windings"
3642,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"from first to last, by employing all the arts, all the expedients, all the"
3643,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"resources of Imagination, chief among which are Action, Invention, and"
3644,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Situation. To these, of course, must be added copious, elastic, and"
3645,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"dignified language, melody, pathos, and just imagery; for, without these,"
3646,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"a man is not a poet at all. These are the very instruments of his craft,"
3647,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the very credentials of his profession; and if he has these, no one will"
3648,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"challenge his right to be called a poet. But, unless the higher qualities,"
3649,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the greater credentials are also his, he must be content with an inferior"
3650,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"place, no matter how many beautiful or sublime things he may have said,"
3651,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,and no matter how excellent the doctrines he may have taught. He has
3652,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"failed to show his mastery over the great materials, his familiarity with"
3653,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the great purposes, of his art. Wordsworth projected two long poems, _The"
3654,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Prelude_ and _The Excursion_; and, practically, these two are one. They"
3655,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,are of portentous length; and that is their only claim to be considered
3656,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"great. They have no Action, no Situation, no Invention, no Characters."
3657,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"They consist of pages upon pages, nay, of books upon books, of"
3658,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"interminable talk, in which in reality Wordsworth himself is the only"
3659,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"talker. Little of the talk is poetry. Much of it is, as Mr. Arnold says,"
3660,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"""abstract verbiage."" But we need not pursue the theme. Mr. Arnold candidly"
3661,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"confesses that when Jeffrey said of _The Excursion_, ""this will never do,"""
3662,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,he was quite right.
3663,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3664,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Unquestionably, he was right; and he would still have been right, even had"
3665,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,_The Excursion_ contained a far greater number of passages of true poetry
3666,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"than it does. It will be an evil day for poetry, and for the readers of"
3667,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poetry, if it ever comes to be allowed that the sole or the main function"
3668,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"of poetry is to _talk about_ things, and that a man can get himself"
3669,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"accepted as a great poet by pursuing this course. Unfortunately, it was"
3670,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Wordsworth's theory that he could. It would be fatal if critics became of
3671,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the same opinion. It is their bounden duty, on the contrary, to protest"
3672,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"against such a theory. Wordsworth sets it down, in black and white, both"
3673,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"in prose and verse, over and over again:"
3674,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3675,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,O Reader! had you in your mind
3676,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Such stores as silent thought can bring,"
3677,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,O gentle Reader! you will find
3678,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,A tale in everything.
3679,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"What more I have to say is short,"
3680,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,And you must kindly take it:
3681,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"It is no tale; but, should you think,"
3682,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Perhaps a tale you'll make it.
3683,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3684,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Here is the theory full-blown. The poet is not to tell the tale, the"
3685,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"reader is to make it one, by thinking; and if he only thinks enough, he"
3686,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"will find a tale in everything! Could anything be more grotesque, or more"
3687,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"utterly opposed to any sane canon of the function of an author, and his"
3688,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"relation to his readers? It is the business of the poet to tell the tale,"
3689,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,and thereby to set the reader thinking; an altogether different process
3690,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"from the one here suggested. ""Wordsworthians against whom we must be upon"
3691,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"our guard,"" often cite the following stanza with admiration:"
3692,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3693,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,The moving accident is not my trade;
3694,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,To freeze the blood I have no ready arts:
3695,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"'Tis my delight, alone in summer shade,"
3696,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,To pipe a simple song for thinking hearts!
3697,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3698,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Have they forgotten the ""moving accidents by flood and field,"" or do they"
3699,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,not know whose trade it was to unfold a tale that
3700,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3701,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood?"
3702,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3703,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Piping a simple song for thinking hearts, is all very well. But it will"
3704,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"not do to say, or to suggest, or to allow it to be inferred, that doing"
3705,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,this makes a man as great a poet as doing what Wordsworth did not and
3706,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"plainly could not do. In the last book of _The Excursion_, he says:"
3707,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3708,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Life, death, eternity! momentous themes"
3709,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Are they--and might demand a seraph's tongue,"
3710,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Were they not equal to their own support;
3711,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,And therefore no incompetence of mine
3712,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Could do them wrong....
3713,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Ye wished for art and circumstance, that make"
3714,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,The individual known and understood;
3715,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,And such as my best judgment could select
3716,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"From what the place afforded, could be given."
3717,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3718,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"But _no_ subject is equal to its own support, where the poet is concerned,"
3719,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,however it may be with the preacher and the moralist. The poet himself
3720,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"must support it. We _do_ wish for act and circumstance, in poetry; and"
3721,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"when Wordsworth tells us that he has, in _The Excursion_, given us the"
3722,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"best of these he can, we can only answer that this best is not enough, but"
3723,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,wholly insufficient and inadequate.
3724,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3725,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"That Mr. Arnold would deny all this, if put to him plainly, we do not"
3726,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,believe. It is all the more to be regretted that he should have expressed
3727,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,himself in such a manner as to encourage others in forming judgments and
3728,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,holding opinions which imply affirmation to the contrary. When he quotes
3729,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"from Wordsworth the following lines,"
3730,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3731,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Of truth, of grandeur, beauty, love, and hope,"
3732,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"And melancholy fear subdued by faith,"
3733,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Of blessëd consolation, in distress,"
3734,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Of moral strength and intellectual power,"
3735,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Of joy in widest commonalty spread,"
3736,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3737,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"and adds that ""here we have a poet intent on the best and master thing,"""
3738,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"and wishes us to infer Wordsworth's superiority from that fact, does he"
3739,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"not perceive that he is not only misleading his readers, but flagrantly"
3740,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"contradicting what he himself avers in the selfsame essay? Being ""intent"""
3741,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,on these subjects is not enough. A further question remains to be
3742,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,answered; viz. how has the poet dealt with them? Nowhere has Wordsworth
3743,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"dealt with them so completely, so ambitiously, so exhaustively, as in _The"
3744,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Excursion_. Yet what does Mr. Arnold say of it? He says that _The
3745,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Excursion_ can never be a satisfactory work to the disinterested lover of
3746,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poetry, and that much of it is ""a tissue of elevated but abstract"
3747,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"verbiage, alien to the very nature of poetry."" It is plain, therefore,"
3748,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"that being ""intent"" even on ""the best and master thing"" does not suffice."
3749,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"The passage Mr. Arnold quotes, leaving the incautious reader to infer that"
3750,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"it _does_ suffice, is merely the"
3751,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3752,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Life, death, eternity! momentous themes,"
3753,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3754,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"and their being ""equal to their own support"" over again. Wordsworth is"
3755,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"perpetually telling us that his subject is Man, and wishes us to infer"
3756,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"that, the subject being great, what is written on it must be great."
3757,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Unfortunately, Man, with him, is like Love with the Scotch girl; it is Man"
3758,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"""in the abstract."" Shakespeare also treats of Man; but he treats of him"
3759,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"_in men_, and Wordsworth does not. In fact, he communes. As M. Scherer"
3760,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"says, he is a Solitary, a Contemplative. In a word, he is essentially, and"
3761,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"before all things a subjective poet, and reader after reader has"
3762,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"complained, and critic after critic has confessed, that to be subjective,"
3763,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"not objective, to reflect instead of to act, to think rather than to"
3764,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"narrate, is the bane of modern poetry, and the conclusive mark of the"
3765,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,inferiority of so large a proportion of it.
3766,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3767,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Yet, this notwithstanding, Mr. Arnold tells us that Wordsworth ""deals with"
3768,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"that in which life really consists""; and, not content with this, he"
3769,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"actually goes on to declare that ""Wordsworth deals with more of life than"
3770,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"they do"";--""they"" being every English poet since Milton, and indeed every"
3771,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poet of every tongue since Milton, with the exception of Goethe! We can"
3772,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"only say that such an assertion is astounding; the most startling paradox,"
3773,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"indeed, we ever encountered in a criticism by a critic of authority. To"
3774,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"argue upon it against Mr. Arnold is, happily, superfluous; for Mr. Arnold"
3775,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,has anticipated and categorically answered his own paradox. Let him open
3776,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"his own poems; let him turn to _Stanzas In Memory Of Obermann_, and let"
3777,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,him read on until he comes to the following couplet:
3778,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3779,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"But Wordsworth's eyes avert their ken,"
3780,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,From half of human fate.
3781,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3782,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Has he forgotten the passage? or would he now expunge it? Mr. Arnold the
3783,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poet, and Mr. Arnold the critic, are evidently at issue. But we think no"
3784,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"one will experience much difficulty in deciding which of two has ""hit the"
3785,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"nail on the head,"" and whether it be sound criticism to affirm that"
3786,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Wordsworth deals with that in which life really consists, or sound"
3787,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,criticism to affirm that with one half of life he does not deal at all. At
3788,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"any rate, these rival criticisms are not to be reconciled, and Mr. Arnold"
3789,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,must elect between the two.
3790,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3791,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,What is the first and broad conclusion to be drawn from all that has been
3792,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"said? It is this: that Wordsworth, as a poet, has treated great subjects"
3793,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"with marked and striking inadequacy, and smaller subjects with marked and"
3794,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,striking success. Now we submit that no man deserves to be called or
3795,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,considered a great poet who has not treated some great subject in a great
3796,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"manner. This is the mark, this is the test, of a great poet; and if we"
3797,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"once surrender this distinction, this standard, we soon lose ourselves in"
3798,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,hopeless critical confusion and entanglement. But no great subject _can_
3799,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"be greatly or adequately treated in poetry, save objectively, and with the"
3800,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"help of action, passion, incident, of all the expedients, in fact, we have"
3801,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,enumerated. It never can be treated adequately or greatly by merely
3802,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,writing _about_ it. This is all that Wordsworth has done with his great
3803,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"subjects, with ""truth, grandeur, beauty, love,"" and the rest of them; and"
3804,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"therefore, as far as great subjects are concerned, he has failed, and"
3805,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"failed conspicuously. Where he has succeeded, and succeeded conspicuously,"
3806,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"succeeded admirably, succeeded perfectly, is in smaller subjects, such as"
3807,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"_The Solitary Reaper_, _The Cuckoo_, _Three Years She Grew_, and their"
3808,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,companions. This is to have done much; but it is not to have left behind
3809,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"""an ample body of powerful work."" Much less is it to have left behind an"
3810,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"""ampler"" body of powerful work than every English poet since Milton, Byron"
3811,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,included.
3812,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3813,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"For what is the ""ample body of powerful work"" that Byron has left? If"
3814,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Byron had failed as completely as Wordsworth in the treatment of his
3815,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"larger themes, in a word, of his great subjects, then, in spite of much"
3816,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"fine lyrical work in Byron, the palm would have to be adjudged to"
3817,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Wordsworth. But what critic of authority, who means to retain it, will"
3818,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,come forward and assert that Byron has failed in the treatment of his
3819,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"larger themes, of his great subjects? Is _Childe Harold_ a failure? Is"
3820,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"_Manfred_ a failure? Is _Cain_ a failure? Is _Don Juan_ a failure? We,"
3821,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"like Mr. Arnold, can honestly say that though we ""felt the expiring wave"
3822,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"of Byron's mighty influence,"" we now ""regard him, and have long regarded"
3823,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"him, without illusion""; in fact, with just as little illusion as we regard"
3824,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Wordsworth, which is perhaps more than Mr. Arnold can yet say. We are"
3825,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"unable to assert, with Scott, that, in _Cain_, ""Byron has matched Milton"
3826,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"on his own ground."" It would have been very wonderful if he had, as"
3827,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"wonderful as if Virgil had matched Homer on Homer's own ground. ""Sero"
3828,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"venientibus ossa""; or, as some one put it during the controversy between"
3829,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"the respective merits of the Ancients and the Moderns, ""The Ancients have"
3830,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"stolen all our best ideas."" Besides, though Byron has not matched Milton"
3831,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"on the ground Milton occupied first and pretty nigh exhausted, Byron has"
3832,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,done many other things that Milton has not done. We are equally unable to
3833,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"say that Byron, ""as various in composition as Shakespeare himself, has"
3834,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"embraced every topic in human life""; though we strongly incline to think"
3835,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,that a dispassionate and exhaustive survey would show him to be more
3836,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"various in composition, and to have embraced a greater number of topics"
3837,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"appertaining to human life, than any poet, English or foreign, ancient or"
3838,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"modern, except Shakespeare.[1] Equally unable are we to accept the dictum"
3839,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"of Goethe, which Mr. Arnold vainly endeavours to explain away, by trying"
3840,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"to prove that Goethe did not mean what he certainly said, viz. that Byron"
3841,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"""is in the main greater than any other English poet."""
3842,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3843,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Therefore, as we say, we look upon Byron without any illusion, and without"
3844,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"any wish to extol him above his real rank, by calling on his behalf even"
3845,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,such witnesses as Scott and Goethe. We look at his works with the same
3846,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,detachment and dispassionateness as we look at the Parthenon or on the
3847,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Venus of Milo. But, so looking on them, looking on them not through any"
3848,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"pet theories of our own, not with any moral, theological, or sectarian"
3849,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"bias, but simply with the same ""dispassionate-lover-of-poetry"" eyes with"
3850,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"which we look on _Antigone_, the _Æneid_, the _Fairy Queen_, or _Faust_,"
3851,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"we find ourselves unable to resist the conclusion, that, like them,"
3852,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"_Childe Harold_, _Manfred_, _Cain_, and _Don Juan_ are great poems, are"
3853,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"great themes, greatly treated. This is not to say that they are perfect,"
3854,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,that they are in every way satisfactory. Is the _Fairy Queen_ perfectly
3855,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,satisfactory? Is the _Æneid_ perfectly satisfactory? No critic has ever
3856,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,found them so. Is the _Iliad_ perfectly satisfactory? It would be very odd
3857,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"if it were, seeing that, as no one but Mr. Gladstone any longer doubts, it"
3858,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"is the work, not of one poet, but of several poets. But when all has been"
3859,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"urged against them that can be urged by the most judicial criticism, they"
3860,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"remain great subjects greatly executed. In the same manner, so do Byron's"
3861,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"greater poems. Roughly and broadly speaking, they _are_ satisfactory;"
3862,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,whereas in no sense can _The Prelude_ and _The Excursion_ be said to be
3863,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"satisfactory. On the contrary, they are entirely unsatisfactory. In a"
3864,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"word, of Byron's larger works, it may be said that they will ""do""; of"
3865,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Wordsworth's, on the contrary, as Jeffrey said, and as Mr. Arnold himself"
3866,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"allows, they ""won't."" That is the distinction; and it is an immense one."
3867,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3868,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Byron is not Shakespeare; for he lags considerably behind Shakespeare in
3869,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Invention, Action, and Character, by dint of which, and in conjunction"
3870,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"with which, the highest faculties of the poet are displayed. But a poet"
3871,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"may lag considerably behind Shakespeare, and yet exhibit these in a"
3872,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"conspicuous degree. It is in Character, no doubt, that Byron is more"
3873,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"particularly weak, as compared with Shakespeare, though he is by no means"
3874,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"so weak, in himself, and as compared with others, as people have come to"
3875,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"assume, by hearing the point so superficially iterated. It is not that"
3876,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Byron cannot depict character; but he does not depict a sufficient number
3877,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,of characters. They are not numerous and various enough. When M. Scherer
3878,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"says that ""Byron has treated hardly any subject but one--himself,"" he is"
3879,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"repeating the parrot-cry of very shallow people, and is doing little"
3880,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"justice to his own powers as a critic. Indeed, had Shakespeare never"
3881,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"lived, it is probable that it would never have occurred to any one to urge"
3882,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,against Byron his deficiencies in this respect. It is because he is so
3883,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"great a poet, because he is so great in other respects, and because some"
3884,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,critics have therefore inadvertently attempted to place him on a level
3885,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"with Shakespeare, that his inferiority in this particular suggested itself"
3886,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"to those holding a juster view. Once suggested, it was harped upon,"
3887,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"exaggerated, and, we may fairly say, has now been done to death. We"
3888,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"presume, however, that no one would suggest that, even in the poetic"
3889,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"presentation of Character, Byron, however inferior to certain other"
3890,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"writers, is not immeasurably superior to Wordsworth, who never even"
3891,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,attempted to portray Character.
3892,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3893,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,When we turn from the consideration of the power shown by Byron in the
3894,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"presentation of Character, to his power shown in Action, Invention, and"
3895,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Situation, the account becomes a very different one. In brisk and rapid"
3896,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"narrative, in striking incident, in prompt and perpetual"
3897,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"movement--qualities in which not only is Wordsworth deficient, but of"
3898,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,which he is absolutely devoid--Byron exhibits his true greatness as a
3899,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poet. Even in the _Tales_, in _The Giaour_, _The Bride of Abydos_, _The"
3900,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Corsair_, _The Siege of Corinth_, _The Prisoner of Chillon_, which it has"
3901,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"of late been the fashion, we had almost said the affectation, to"
3902,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"depreciate, there is a stir, a ""go,"" a swift and swirling torrent of"
3903,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"action, a current of animation, a full and foaming stream of narrative, a"
3904,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"tumult and conflict of incident, which will never cease to be regarded as"
3905,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"among the best, the highest, and the most indispensable elements of"
3906,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poetry, until we are all laid up in lavender, until we all take to moping"
3907,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"and brooding over our own feelings, until we all confine ourselves to"
3908,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"""smooth passions, smooth discourse, and joyous thought""; until we all"
3909,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,become content
3910,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3911,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"To sit without emotion, hope, or aim,"
3912,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,In the loved presence of the cottage-fire.
3913,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"And listen to the flapping of the flame,"
3914,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Or kettle whispering its faint undersong.
3915,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3916,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Even if one confined oneself merely to Byron's _Tales_, the assertion that"
3917,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Wordsworth ""deals with more of life"" than Byron, would be startling. Love,"
3918,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"hatred, revenge, ambition, the rivalry of creeds, travel, fighting,"
3919,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"fighting by land and fighting by sea, almost every passion, and every form"
3920,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"of adventure, these are the ""life"" they deal with; and we submit that it"
3921,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,is to deal with a considerable portion of it; with far more of life at any
3922,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,rate than Wordsworth deals with in the whole of his poems. Listen to his
3923,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,own confession:
3924,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3925,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,And thus from day to day my little boat
3926,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Rocks in its harbour, lodging peaceably."
3927,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3928,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Now turn to Byron:
3929,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3930,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"O'er the glad waters of the dark blue sea,"
3931,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Our thoughts as boundless, and our souls as free,"
3932,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Far as the breeze can bear, the billows foam,"
3933,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Survey our empire, and behold our home."
3934,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"These are our realms, no limit to their sway!"
3935,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3936,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,That is precisely the difference. The horizon of Byron is so much larger.
3937,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Far from it being true that Wordsworth deals with more of life than Byron
3938,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"does, the precise opposite is the truth, that Byron deals with far more of"
3939,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"life than Wordsworth does, if by life we mean the life of men, of men of"
3940,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"action, of men of the world, and not the life, as M. Scherer says, of"
3941,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Solitaries, Contemplatives, and Recluses."
3942,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3943,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"If we turn to Byron's Dramas, to _Sardanapalus_, to _The Two Foscari_, to"
3944,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"_The Doge of Venice_, no doubt we crave for yet more action, more"
3945,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"incident, more situation, than Byron gives us. But we do so because"
3946,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Shakespeare has accustomed us to crave for more; and the craving has been
3947,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,intensified by the sensational character of modern novels and modern
3948,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"stage-plays. Nevertheless these are present, in no small amount, in the"
3949,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,plays we have named; and whether people choose to consider the amount
3950,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"great or small, surely it is immeasurably greater than the amount of"
3951,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"action, invention, and situation Wordsworth exhibits in any and every"
3952,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poem, of any and every kind, he ever wrote."
3953,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
3954,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"We have more than once mentioned _Childe Harold_, but we must refer to it"
3955,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"once more and finally, in support and illustration of what we have been"
3956,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,urging. The persons who are of opinion that Byron never treated any
3957,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"subject but himself, will perhaps likewise be of opinion that, in _Childe"
3958,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Harold_, Byron treats only of himself, and that it is a purely"
3959,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,contemplative and subjective poem. A more superficial opinion could not
3960,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"well be held. In form contemplative, it is in substance a poem full of"
3961,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"action, situation, and incident; in a word, it is a poem essentially and"
3962,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"notably objective. It is the only poem, ostensibly contemplative, of which"
3963,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,this can be said; and it assumes this complexion and character by dint of
3964,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Byron's own character, which was above all things active, and could not be"
3965,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"content without action. In _Childe Harold_, Byron summons dead men and"
3966,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"dead nations from their sepulchres, and makes them live and act again. He"
3967,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"revivifies Athens, he resuscitates Rome. He makes Cicero breathe and burn;"
3968,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,he makes the fallen columns and shattered pillars of the Forum as eloquent
3969,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,as Tully. Petrarch once more waters the tree that bears his lady's name.
3970,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,The mountains find a tongue. Jura answers from her misty shroud. The
3971,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,lightning becomes a word. Rousseau tortures himself afresh; Gibbon afresh
3972,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,saps solemn creeds with solemn sneer; afresh Egeria visits Numa in the
3973,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"silence of the night, his breast to hers replying. Lake Leman woos, and"
3974,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"kisses away the cries of the Rhone, as they awake. Then she reproves like"
3975,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,a sister's voice. The boats upon the lake are wings to waft us from
3976,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,distraction. The stars become the poetry of Heaven. Waterloo is fought
3977,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,before our very eyes. The defiles fatal to Roman rashness are again
3978,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"crowded with Numidian horse, and Hannibal and Thrasymene flash before our"
3979,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,eyes. A soul is infused into the dead; a spirit is instilled into the
3980,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"mountains. The torrents talk; the sepulchres act. Movement never ceases,"
3981,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,and the situation is perpetually shifting. Its incidents are almost the
3982,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,whole of History. In it we have--what M. Scherer justly says Wordsworth
3983,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"has not--the knowledge of the human heart which worldly experience gives,"
3984,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,the interior drama of the passions which a man can describe well only on
3985,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"condition of having been their victim, and those general views upon"
3986,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"History and society which are formed partly by study, partly by the"
3987,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"practice of affairs. All this, too, we have, in the third and fourth"
3988,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"cantos--for the first and second are very inferior--presented, in"
3989,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"language, imagery, and music, of the noblest and most elevated kind; till,"
3990,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"swelling, as an organ swells, before it closes, the poem concludes with"
3991,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"that magnificent address to the Ocean, which rounds it off and completes"
3992,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"it, even as the physical ocean rounds off and completes the physical"
3993,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,earth. In no other poem that was ever written are Nature and man--not Man
3994,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"in the abstract, but men as they act, strive, feel, and suffer--so"
3995,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,thoroughly interfused and interwoven; and they are interwoven and
3996,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"interfused as they are interwoven and interfused in actual life, not by"
3997,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"men contemplating and talking, but by men doing and acting, in a word, by"
3998,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"living. And if the reference be to men in general and life in general, and"
3999,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,not to a particular sort of man living a particular sort of life away from
4000,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"other men, then we make bold to say, though in doing so we contradict Mr."
4001,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Arnold roundly, that in _Childe Harold_ alone there is ""an ampler body of"
4002,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"powerful work,"" and that _Childe Harold_ alone ""deals with more of life,"""
4003,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"than all Wordsworth's poems, not even selected from, but taken in their"
4004,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"integrity, without the diminution of a single passage or the omission of a"
4005,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,single line.
4006,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
4007,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"At this point, Mr. Arnold steps in with a notable plea. It may be that"
4008,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"much of what Wordsworth has written is trivial, and that still more of it"
4009,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"is abstract verbiage, or doctrine we hear in church, perfectly true, but"
4010,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"wanting in the sort of truth we require, poetic truth. It may also be that"
4011,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Wordsworth has written no one great poem, and that the poem he fancied to"
4012,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"be great will not do, and can never be satisfactory to the disinterested"
4013,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,lover of poetry. It may furthermore be the case that in Wordsworth's poems
4014,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"we have to lament a deficiency, if not indeed a total absence of Action,"
4015,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Invention, Situation, and Character, and that he is only a Contemplative,"
4016,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"a Recluse, a Solitary, analysing the sensations produced upon himself by"
4017,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"dwelling upon mountains, woods, and waters. All this may be so. But, says"
4018,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Mr. Arnold, ""Poetry is at bottom a criticism of life,"" the greatness of a"
4019,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poet depends upon his criticism of life, and Wordsworth's criticism of"
4020,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"life is more complete, more powerful, and more sound, than that of any"
4021,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"English poet since Milton, indeed than that of any poet since Milton, with"
4022,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,the one exception of Goethe.
4023,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
4024,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,The great and the justly acquired authority of Mr. Arnold must not deter
4025,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,us from saying that to no canon of criticism upon poetry with which we are
4026,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,acquainted do so many objections present themselves. We suspect Mr. Arnold
4027,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,himself has discerned some of these since he first propounded it; for
4028,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,while in his Prefatory Essay upon Wordsworth he urges it with absolute
4029,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"confidence, in his Prefatory Essay on Byron he does so more hesitatingly,"
4030,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"and exhibits more anxiety to explain it. But does he not explain it away,"
4031,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"when he says, ""We are not brought much on our way, I admit, towards an"
4032,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"adequate definition of poetry as distinguished from prose by that truth""?"
4033,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Upon this point M. Scherer, an admirer, like ourselves, of both Wordsworth"
4034,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"and Mr. Arnold, has some just observations:"
4035,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
4036,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Wordsworth seems to Mr. Arnold to have the qualities of poetic
4037,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"greatness, and Mr. Arnold accordingly defines these qualities. The"
4038,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"great poet, in his opinion, is the one that expresses the most noble"
4039,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"and the most profound idea, upon the nature of man, the one who has a"
4040,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"philosophy of life, and who impresses it powerfully on the subjects"
4041,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"which he treats. The definition, it will be perceived, is a little"
4042,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,vague.
4043,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
4044,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Mr. Arnold, we all know, is rather partial to vagueness, being of opinion"
4045,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"that it is of the essence of Culture to be more or less vague, and that"
4046,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,without a certain amount of vagueness there can be no sweetness and no
4047,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,light. We should be sorry to seem to say anything against those delightful
4048,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"characteristics, lest we should be supposed to be without them; and we"
4049,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"hereby declare ourselves all in favour of our ""consciousness playing"
4050,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"about our stock notions,"" even if those stock notions be sweetness and"
4051,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"light themselves, with their accompanying charm of vagueness. But though,"
4052,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"in all seriousness, what Swift calls sweetness and light are invaluable"
4053,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"qualities, despite the partial vagueness they entail, yet when two poets"
4054,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"are compared, and a definition of the main business and main essence of"
4055,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poetry is offered, in order that by it the relative greatness of the two"
4056,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"may be tested, it is just as well that the definition should not be too"
4057,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"vague, should be at any rate precise enough to afford the test desired."
4058,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"But what is the use of it if it does not ""bring us much on our way""?"
4059,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
4060,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Unfortunately, Mr. Arnold's theory of poetry being a criticism of life not"
4061,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"only does not help us along our road, it tends to take us off our road. We"
4062,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"regret we have not left ourselves space to deal with his theory at length,"
4063,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,and can only hope we may have an opportunity of returning to it. But lest
4064,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Mr. Arnold should be tempted to raise it to the dignity of a ""stock"
4065,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"notion,"" and to bestow upon it the privilege of that faithful iteration"
4066,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"which is bestowed upon ""culture,"" ""sweetness and light,"" ""Barbarians,"
4067,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Philistines, and Populace,"" which have a good deal more to say for"
4068,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"themselves, we think it well to point out to him that, by averring poetry"
4069,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"to be ""a criticism of life,"" he is giving a handle to the Philistines of"
4070,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"criticism, and to the enemies of sweetness and light, which they may turn"
4071,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,against him in a notable manner.
4072,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
4073,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"For _whose_ ""criticism of life""? Does he not perceive that he is enabling"
4074,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"people to maintain, which unfortunately they are already only too disposed"
4075,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"to do, that this poet is a great poet because they consider his criticism"
4076,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"of life to be right and true, and that other poet to be not a great poet,"
4077,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"or a much smaller poet, because they consider his criticism of life to be"
4078,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"wrong and false? Why, this is the very pest and bane of English criticism"
4079,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"upon poetry, and upon art generally; the criticism which in reality"
4080,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"resolves itself into ""I agree with this; I like that."" This is the"
4081,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"criticism of sheer and unadulterated Philistinism, against which Mr."
4082,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Arnold has been waging such excellent and needed war for several years.
4083,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Nor, in spite of much vagueness, will it be possible for Mr. Arnold to"
4084,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,escape from this consequence of his dictum that poetry is a criticism of
4085,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"life. For at last, after much that seems to us like beating about the"
4086,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"bush, he goes straight to the point, and makes the fatal confession in"
4087,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,plain words.
4088,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
4089,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"As compared with Leopardi, Wordsworth, though at many points less"
4090,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"lucid, though far less a master of style, far less of an artist,"
4091,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"gains so much by his criticism of life being, in certain matters of"
4092,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"profound importance, healthful and true, whereas Leopardi's pessimism"
4093,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"is not, that the value of Wordsworth's poetry, on the whole, stands"
4094,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"higher for us, I think, than that of Leopardi's, as it stands higher"
4095,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"for us, I think, than that of any modern poetry except Goethe's."
4096,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
4097,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Higher, because it is more healthful! That any critic, not an abject"
4098,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Philistine, should say such a thing, amazes us beyond words. Surely Mr."
4099,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Arnold is aware that there are persons whose opinion on that subject
4100,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"carries much weight, who consider that Goethe's criticism of life is"
4101,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"neither healthful nor true, but on the contrary false or mischievous, yet"
4102,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,who do not on that account deny to Goethe the title of a great poet. Is
4103,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Mr. Arnold really serious when he asserts that, other things being equal,"
4104,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"one poet is less great than another poet because the first is a pessimist,"
4105,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"and the other is an optimist? If he is, let us have two more volumes of"
4106,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Selections; one containing all the best optimist poetry, and the other"
4107,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"containing all the best pessimist poetry, that was ever written. Which"
4108,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"collection would be the more true, we do not undertake to know, and, as"
4109,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"critics and disinterested lovers of poetry, we do not care. But we"
4110,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,entertain no doubt whatever which Selection would contain the finest
4111,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,poetry. It would not be the optimist one. Some of the finest poetry ever
4112,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,written upon life is to be found surely in the Old Testament. What might
4113,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"be taken as its motto? ""Vanity of Vanities. All is Vanity."" As far as this"
4114,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"life, and any criticism of it are concerned, it is a very Gospel of"
4115,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Pessimism.
4116,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
4117,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Is the conclusion then that a pessimistic criticism of life necessarily
4118,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,makes a poet greater than another poet who criticises it from an
4119,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,optimistic point of view? Not in the least. The consideration--we do not
4120,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"say to the positive philosopher, to the historian, to the moralist,"
4121,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"but--to the disinterested lover of poetry, is simply irrelevant."
4122,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
4123,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,But there is an attitude towards life which does give a poet the chance at
4124,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,least of being greater than either a poet who criticises life as a
4125,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"pessimist, or than a poet who criticises it as an optimist. That attitude"
4126,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"is one neither of pessimism nor of optimism; indeed, not a criticism of"
4127,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"life at all, or at least not such a criticism of life as to leave it open"
4128,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"to any one to declare that it is healthful and true, or that it is"
4129,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,insalubrious and false. Will Mr. Arnold tell us what is Shakespeare's
4130,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,criticism of life? Is it pessimistic or optimistic? We are almost alarmed
4131,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"at asking the question; for who knows that, in doing so, we may not be"
4132,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,sowing the seeds of a controversy as long and as interminable as the
4133,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"controversy respecting the moral purpose, the criticism of life in"
4134,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"_Hamlet_? Once started, the controversy will go on for ever, precisely"
4135,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"because there is no way of ending it. What constitutes, not the"
4136,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"superiority, but the comparative inferiority, of Byron and Wordsworth"
4137,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"alike, is their excessive criticism of life. They criticise life overmuch."
4138,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,It is the foible of each of them. What constitutes the superiority of
4139,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Shakespeare is, that he does not so much criticise life, as present it. He"
4140,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"holds the mirror up to nature, and is content to do so, showing it with"
4141,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"all its beautiful and all its ugly features, and with perfect"
4142,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,dispassionateness. Hence his unequalled greatness.
4143,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
4144,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,We regret we have not space to set this forth more at length. But Mr.
4145,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Arnold will scarcely misunderstand us; and we would venture to ask him to
4146,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"ponder these objections, and to let his consciousness play freely about"
4147,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"them. If he does so, we have little doubt that the theory about poetry"
4148,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"being a criticism of life, with its appalling consequences to the critic,"
4149,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"to the disinterested lover of poetry, to the adherent of culture, to the"
4150,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"friend of sweetness and light, and in fact to every one but the Philistine"
4151,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"with his stock ideas, will silently be dropped."
4152,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
4153,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"But if Mr. Arnold sees insuperable objections to this course, and the"
4154,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,canon about poetry being a criticism of life is to be added to that list
4155,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"of delightful formulæ, which, during the last decade, have shed so much"
4156,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"light on our condition, then we can only once more appeal from Mr. Arnold"
4157,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"to Mr. Arnold, and ask how it is that Wordsworth can be considered to have"
4158,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"criticised life, and to ""deal with that in which life really consists,"" if"
4159,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"it be true, as Mr. Arnold tells us it is true, that"
4160,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
4161,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,Wordsworth's eyes avert their ken
4162,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,From half of human fate.
4163,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
4164,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"How, we shall still have to ask, can a poet be said to have criticised"
4165,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"life of whom such an ardent admirer as M. Scherer can observe, ""As for"
4166,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"cities, Wordsworth seeks to ignore them. He takes them for a discordant"
4167,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,note which it is only just and right to drown and get rid of in the
4168,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"general harmony of creation."""
4169,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,
4170,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,But we must end; and we submit that we have established our case.
4171,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Wordsworth can be made to figure as the greatest poet since Milton, only"
4172,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,by canons of criticism that would make him not only a greater poet than
4173,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Milton, but a greater poet than any poet that preceded Milton. If this be"
4174,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"so, let us know it. But if not, it is vain work, trying to extol him, as a"
4175,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"poet, above Byron. Mr. Arnold has done Byron injustice by making"
4176,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"selections from his works, and asserting that selections are better than"
4177,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,the whole of the works from which they are selected. You might as well
4178,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"select from a mountain. What should we think of the process that said,"
4179,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"""Here is an edelweiss, here some heather, here a lump of quartz, here a"
4180,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"bit of ice from a glacier, here some water from a torrent, here some"
4181,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"pine-cones, here some eggs from an eagle's nest; and now you know all"
4182,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"about Mont Blanc""? Byron is no more to be known in that fashion than the"
4183,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"Matterhorn is. You must make acquaintances with pastoral valleys, with"
4184,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"yawning precipices, with roaring cataracts, with tinkling cattle-bells,"
4185,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"with the rumble of avalanches, with the growl of thunder, with the zigzag"
4186,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"lightning, with storm, and mists, and sudden burst of tenderest sunshine,"
4187,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"with these, with more, in fact with all, if Alp or Byron is to be really"
4188,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,known. But Mr. Arnold has rendered Byron one service at least. When he
4189,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,says that Byron and Wordsworth stand first and pre-eminent among the
4190,BYRON AND WORDSWORTH,"English poets of this century, he relieves Byron of danger of rivalry."

4740,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,The imaginative estimate or ideal conception of Woman by the Poets has
4741,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"always been deemed exceptionally interesting, especially by women"

4746,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"portrait, to obtain recognition, must have in it some resemblance to the"

4748,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"to affirm that any representation of women, at least of womanly women,"
4749,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,that was not attractive would be a travesty of the fact.
4750,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4751,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Alike in the _Vita Nuova_ and the _Divina Commedia_, Beatrice Portinari"
4752,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"figures so largely, and Dante's love for her from childhood in her tenth"
4753,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,till her death in her twenty-sixth year is so striking that most persons
4754,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"think of the great Florentine Poet in association with no other women,"
4755,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"their characters, their occupations, temptations, weaknesses, virtues, and"
4756,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,everyday duties. Yet no man could be a Poet such as Dante who confined his
4757,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"ken to so limited a field of observation and feeling, and to whom the"
4758,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"whole range of feminine emotion and action was not familiar; and, in the"
4759,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"exposition of that theme, I would invite attention to that wider range and"
4760,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"scope of interest, though from it Beatrice will not be forgotten. Let us"
4761,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"turn, first of all, to the fifteenth canto of the _Paradiso_, where"
4762,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Cacciaguida, the Poet's ancestor, describes, while Beatrice looks on with"

4764,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"alike in men and women, but in women especially--times dear to Dante,"

4792,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,and only the acceptance of the idea of Poetry prevailing amongst us of
4793,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"late years, which is essentially false, because so narrow and so exclusive"
4794,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"of the simplest poetry at one end of the scale, and of the highest poetry"

4825,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,In the whole range of poetic literature there is no more celebrated
4826,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"passage than the essentially domestic picture, in the Sixth Book of the"
4827,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"_Iliad_, of Hector, Andromache, and their baby boy, where the Trojan hero,"
4828,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"before sallying forth to battle afresh, stretches out his arms to clasp"
4829,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,the little Astyanax. It might be pedantic to recite the passage in the
4830,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,original. But here is an excellent translation of it by Mr. Walter Leaf:
4831,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4832,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"So spake glorious Hector, and stretched out his arms to his boy. But"
4833,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"the child shrank back to the bosom of his fair-girdled nurse,"
4834,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"dismayed at his dear father's aspect, and in dread at the horse-hair"
4835,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,crest that he beheld nodding fiercely from the helmet's top. Then his
4836,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"dear father laughed aloud, and his lady-mother; and forthwith"
4837,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"glorious Hector took the helmet from his head and laid it, all"
4838,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"gleaming, upon the ground; then kissed he his dear son, and dandled"
4839,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,him in his arms.
4840,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4841,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Surely everybody feels the poetic, the romantic character of the incident,"
4842,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"founded on the loves of the household and the hearth. Turn to Chaucer, to"
4843,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Milton, to Shakespeare, to any great Poet, and you will find that, like"
4844,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Dante, they included simple duties in their poetic conception of woman."
4845,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,Only in an age sicklied o'er with lackadaisical or sensuous sentimentality
4846,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,could it be otherwise.
4847,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4848,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"But a poet's ideals of what women should be, and often are, is shown not"
4849,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"only by what he extols, but by what he condemns, and, in this respect,"
4850,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Dante, poet-like, is sparing and reserved. Most--indeed, nearly all--of"
4851,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,the persons whom he indicates by name as being eternally punished in the
4852,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Circles of the Inferno are men; partly, perhaps, because Dante, who, it"
4853,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"must be owned, would have been loved by Doctor Johnson as a good hater,"
4854,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,had political and other scores of the kind to settle with those he
4855,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"describes as having a perpetual lease in the lower regions, but in part,"
4856,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"also, because he could not bring himself to write harshly of any woman he"
4857,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,had known. But to a few notorious female rebels against what he deemed
4858,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"womanly character and conduct, and who had lived many hundred years before"
4859,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"his day, he is pitilessly severe. It would be difficult to quote lines"
4860,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,from any Poet more so than those in which he describes Semiramis as among
4861,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,those whom
4862,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4863,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,Nulla speranza gli conforta mai.
4864,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4865,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,She has not even hope to fall back on as a mitigation of her endless
4866,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,torments. Of her offences against his ideal of woman he says:
4867,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4868,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"A vizio di lussuria fu si rotta,"
4869,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Che libito fe lecito in sua legge,"
4870,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,Per torre il biasmo in che era condotta.
4871,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4872,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,She was so steeped in wickedness that she promulgated laws permitting
4873,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"others to act as she herself did, in order to annul the stigma that would"
4874,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,otherwise have been attached to her. He is a little hard and unjust to
4875,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Dido, whom Virgil treats with such exquisite tenderness, in naming her"
4876,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"along with ""lustful Cleopatra"" in the same passage. To Helen he is more"
4877,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"indulgent, in words at least, content with saying that she was the guilty"
4878,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"cause of dire events, ""_per cui tanto reo tempo si volse_""; but she does"
4879,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,not escape endless expiation. Some of my readers will remember how much
4880,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"more damning of her conduct is Virgil in the Sixth Book of the _Æneid_,"
4881,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,where Priam represents her as giving the signal to the Greeks to enter
4882,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Troy, and having concealed his sword, that he may fall a helpless victim"
4883,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"to the vengeance of Paris, whom the fair wanton wished to propitiate in"
4884,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,the hour of her lord's triumph.
4885,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4886,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"But what is Dante's attitude towards Francesca da Rimini, in the most"
4887,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"beautiful passage, it seems to me, in the whole range of narrative Poetry?"
4888,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Many, I am sure, know it by heart, and have thereby fortified themselves"
4889,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,against the modern less-refined treatment of it even by men aspiring to be
4890,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"regarded as poets. Often as one has repeated it to oneself, one has never"
4891,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,felt that Dante had for Francesca any harsher feeling than sympathetic
4892,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,compassion. He casts around her the halo of the purest sentiment; he
4893,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"brings music of matchless verbal sweetness to the description of the hour,"
4894,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"the place, the circumstances of her disinterested and unselfish"
4895,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"surrender. The very lines in which he leads up to her pathetic story,"
4896,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,lines in which his feeling concerning frail and hapless love seems to be
4897,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"purposely expressed in general and wide-embracing language, are in"
4898,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,themselves significant to those who observe their meaning. He says that
4899,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,when he heard Virgil name the numerous knights and fair dames who were
4900,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"suffering from having subordinated prudence to impulse, he only felt"
4901,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,troubled for them and bewildered.
4902,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4903,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Pietà mi vinse, e fu quasi smarrito."
4904,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4905,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,The first thing he notices in Francesca and her lover is their buoyancy in
4906,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"the air, as though they were the finest and most tenuous of spirits; and"
4907,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"when he says to Virgil that he would fain have speech with them, the reply"
4908,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"is that he has only to appeal to them by the love that still moves them,"
4909,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,and they will draw nigh to him. Then follows that lovely simile of doves
4910,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"floating to call, and Francesca's recognition of Dante with the words:"
4911,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4912,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,O animal grazioso e benigno!
4913,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4914,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,who is sure to have pity on her hapless doom. When Francesca pauses in her
4915,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"narrative, and Dante bows his head for sorrow, Virgil shows what is his"
4916,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"own feeling by the brief question addressed to Dante, ""What think you?"""
4917,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,Dante replies in a voice broken by emotion:
4918,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4919,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"... O lasso,"
4920,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Quanti dolci pensier, quanto disio"
4921,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,Menò costoro al doloroso passo!
4922,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4923,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"and, turning to Francesca, he says that her fate fills his eyes with tears"
4924,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"and his heart with anguish. Encouraged by the poet's sympathy, she tells"

4926,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"sighs, in itself a preliminary and melodious appeal for indulgence, and"
4927,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"that he must be patient with her if she tells her tale, sobbing as she"
4928,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"speaks. Torn between sweet remembrance and regret, she cannot refrain from"
4929,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,recalling
4930,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4931,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,... il disiato riso
4932,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Esser baciato da cotanto amante,"
4933,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4934,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,or intimating with supreme delicacy what ensued in the final line of her
4935,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,narrative:
4936,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4937,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,Quel giorno più non vi leggemmo avante.
4938,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4939,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,The story she had been reading with Paolo Malatesta of Lancelot and
4940,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Guinevere fell from their hands, and that day they read no further on. And"
4941,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Dante? All he says is that he felt like to die for grief, and fell to the"
4942,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,ground even as a dead body falls. From the first line to the last he
4943,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,utters no word of blame or reproach. He would not have been a poet had he
4944,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,done so.
4945,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4946,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,Let us now turn from the fifth book of the _Inferno_ to the third of the
4947,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"_Paradiso_, that we may add to our knowledge of Dante's poetic conception"
4948,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"of Woman. He there beholds Piccarda Donati, whom he had known in her"
4949,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"lifetime on earth, but at first does not recognise, because, as she"
4950,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"herself says with heavenly humility, she is now much fairer to look on"
4951,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"than she was then. Withal, she adds, she occupies only an inferior place"
4952,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"in Heaven, because she was forced, and sorely against her own will, to"
4953,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,violate her vow of virginity. She begins her story by saying simply:
4954,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4955,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Io fui nel mondo vergine sorella,"
4956,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4957,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"that she was a nun dedicated to God, and goes on to tell how she was"
4958,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"violently torn from her cloister by her brother, Forese Donati, and his"
4959,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"accomplices, to further family ambition, and compelled to submit to the"
4960,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"marriage rite. Dante, feeling, as it seems to me, that this did not"
4961,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"detract from her merit, asks her if she is contented with the relatively"
4962,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,inferior position in Paradise she says she is assigned among celestial
4963,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"denizens. I trust many readers know her reply, for it is one of the"
4964,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,noblest and most beautiful passages in the whole of the _Divina Commedia_.
4965,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Like all fine passages in Poetry, adequate rendering of it in another"
4966,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,tongue is not attainable. But the best translation of it with which I am
4967,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"acquainted is that of C. B. Cayley--no Cary, mark you--in _terza rima_,"
4968,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"and of which I remember I availed myself when, many years ago, I was"
4969,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"beginning to learn Italian, and read Dante for the first time among the"
4970,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,then leafy-covered ruins of the Baths of Caracalla. Here is Piccarda's
4971,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,reply:
4972,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4973,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Our will, O brother mine, is kept at rest"
4974,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"By power of heavenly love, which makes us will,"
4975,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"For nought else thirsting, only things possessed."
4976,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,If we should crave to be exalted still
4977,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"More highly, then our will would not agree"
4978,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"With His, who gives to us the place we fill."
4979,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"For 'tis of our own will the very ground,"
4980,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,That in the will of God we govern ours.
4981,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4982,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Then comes that supremely beautiful line, not to be surpassed by any line"
4983,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,even in Dante:
4984,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4985,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,In la sua voluntade è nostra pace.
4986,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4987,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,Our peace is in submission to His will.
4988,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4989,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,Is it fanciful to think that in that line also Dante has betrayed and
4990,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"bequeathed to us, perhaps unconsciously, his main conception of Woman, as"
4991,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"a gentle and adoring creature, who finds her greatest happiness in"
4992,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,subordinating her will to those who are deserving of the trust she reposes
4993,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,in them?
4994,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
4995,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,But Piccarda does not end the dialogue with her own story. She tells Dante
4996,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"that the great Costanza, as she calls her, who married the German Henry"
4997,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"the Fifth, was also torn from a convent where she had taken the veil, and"
4998,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,forced into Royal nuptials. But when she was thus compelled to violate her
4999,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"vows,"
5000,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
5001,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Contra suo grado e contra buona usanza,"
5002,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,Non fu dal vel del cuor giammai disciolta.
5003,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
5004,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,She wore the vestal's veil within her heart.
5005,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
5006,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"And, as if to indicate that the conduct of each was condoned by the Virgin"
5007,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"of Virgins, Dante concludes by saying:"
5008,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
5009,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,... _Ave
5010,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Maria_, cantando; e cantando vanio,"
5011,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
5012,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"She faded from our sight, singing _Ave Maria_,"
5013,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
5014,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"and once again he concentrated his gaze on Beatrice, Beatrice whom he"
5015,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,regarded as his highest poetic conception of Woman. Fully to grasp what
5016,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"that was, we must descend from Heaven to earth and recall the origin and"
5017,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"growth of his adoration of her, as described in the _Vita Nuova_."
5018,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
5019,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"To some commentators on Dante, the narrative to be read there has"
5020,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"suggested difficulties when, in reality, there are none, leading them to"
5021,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,urge that a child of nine years of age could not feel what is therein
5022,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"described, and that, therefore, it is purely symbolic, and was written not"
5023,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"about any human creature, but indicated Philosophy, or the desire for"
5024,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"spiritual enlightenment and the search for heavenly wisdom, which was"
5025,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,Dante's overpowering impulse almost from the cradle. The answer to such an
5026,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,interpretation of the passage is that it betrays an utter ignorance of the
5027,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"emotional precocity of the poetic temperament, and of the vague but"
5028,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,intense hold Love can acquire over Poets from their earliest years.
5029,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
5030,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Of the reality underlying the idealism of the _Vita Nuova_, we therefore"
5031,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"need have no doubt whatever. Dante's Beatrice was Beatrice Portinari, a"
5032,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Florentine maid first, a Florentine bride later, whose people lived in the"
5033,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Corso, near the Canto de' Pazzi."
5034,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
5035,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,All that follows in the narrative of the _Vita Nuova_ may be relied on
5036,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"just as implicitly; how, when she was eighteen years of age, he met her"
5037,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,again walking in the streets of Florence between two noble ladies older
5038,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"than herself, and graciously, as Dante says, returned his salute; how,"
5039,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"with the naïf shyness of a youth consumed with love, he tried to dissemble"
5040,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"it by pretending to be enamoured of another damsel, which only made"
5041,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,Beatrice look away when she met him; and how he contrived to convey to her
5042,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"indirectly, through a poem he wrote, that she had misjudged him; how,"
5043,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"thereon, she looked on him graciously once more; and how, alas! in her"
5044,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"twenty-fifth year, she was summoned from this world to the world above."
5045,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Then the _Vita Nuova_ draws mournfully to a close, ending with these"
5046,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,significant words:--
5047,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
5048,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"After I had written this sonnet, there appeared to me a wonderful"
5049,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"vision, in which I saw things that made me determine to write no more"
5050,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,of this dear Saint until I should be able to write of her more
5051,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"worthily; and, of a surety, she knows that I study to attain unto"
5052,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"this end with all my powers. So, if it shall please Him by Whom all"
5053,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"things live, to spare my life for some more years, I hope to say that"
5054,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,of her which never yet hath been said of any lady; and then may it
5055,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"please Him, who is the Father of all good, to suffer my soul to see"
5056,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"the glory of its mistress, the sainted Beatrice, who now, abiding in"
5057,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"glory, looketh upon the face of Him who is blessed for ever and ever."
5058,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
5059,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,For the fulfilment of that determination we must return to the _Divina
5060,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Commedia_, written in the fullness of the Poet's powers. But there are"
5061,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,three lines in the _Vita Nuova_ about the death of Beatrice that have
5062,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"haunted me ever since I first read them, and whose beauty, I am sure, all"
5063,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,will feel:
5064,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
5065,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Non la ci tolse qualità di gelo,"
5066,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Nè di color, siccome l'altro fece,"
5067,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,Ma sola fu sua gran benignitade:
5068,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
5069,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"lines very difficult to translate, but the meaning of which is that she"
5070,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"died neither from chill nor from fever, which carries off other mortals,"
5071,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"but only of her great benignness, or excess of goodness, which rendered"
5072,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"earth an unfitting dwelling-place for her, and Paradise her only true"
5073,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,home.
5074,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
5075,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,It is not necessary to comment here on the First Canto of the _Divina
5076,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Commedia_. That, one has done already before the Dante Society, and it is"
5077,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,not requisite for one's present theme. But in Canto the Second we meet
5078,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"with the Beatrice of the _Vita Nuova_. She it is that sends Virgil, who"
5079,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"dwells in the neutral territory of Limbo, to the Poet, saying:"
5080,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
5081,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Io son Beatrice, che ti faccio andare:"
5082,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Amor mi mosse, che mi fa parlare."
5083,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
5084,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"And not only does she say that she is animated by love, which has caused"
5085,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"her, now in Heaven, to feel so compassionately towards him, but also"
5086,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"because he loved her so while she was on earth, and continued to do so"
5087,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"after she had quitted it, with a fidelity that has lifted him above the"
5088,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"crowd of ordinary mortals, and made of him a Poet. Here, let it be said in"
5089,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"passing, we get another indication of Dante's poetic conception of Woman,"
5090,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"which is, among other qualities, to co-operate in the making and fostering"
5091,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"of Poets, a mission in which they have never been wanting. Where, indeed,"
5092,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"is the Poet who could not say of some woman, and, if he be fortunate, of"
5093,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"more than one, what, in the Twenty-second Canto of the _Purgatorio_, Dante"
5094,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"makes Statius say to Virgil, ""_Per te poeta fui_,"" ""It was through you"
5095,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"that I became a Poet."""
5096,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
5097,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Throughout the remaining Cantos of the _Inferno_, Beatrice naturally is"
5098,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"never mentioned, nor yet in the _Purgatorio_, till we reach Canto the"
5099,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Thirtieth, wherein occurs perhaps the most painful scene in the"
5100,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"awe-inspiring poem. In it she descends from Heaven, an apparition of"
5101,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"celestial light, compared by the Poet to the dazzling dawn of a glorious"
5102,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"day. Smitten with fear, he turns for help to Virgil, but Virgil has left"
5103,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"him. ""Weep not,"" says Beatrice to him, ""that Virgil is no longer by your"
5104,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"side; you will need all your tears when you hear me."" Then begins her"
5105,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,terrible arraignment:
5106,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
5107,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Guardaci ben: ben sem, ben sem Beatrice."
5108,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
5109,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Look on me well! Yes, I am Beatrice."
5110,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
5111,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Confused, Dante gazes upon the ground, and then glances at a fountain hard"
5112,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"by; but, seeing his own image trembling in the water, he lowers his eyes"
5113,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"to the green sward encircling it, and fixes them there, while she upbraids"
5114,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"him for his deviation from absolute fidelity to her memory, and his"
5115,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,disregard of her heavenly endeavours still to help and purify him.
5116,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Boccaccio says that Dante was a man of strong passions, and possibly,"
5117,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"indeed probably, he was. But Beatrice seems to reproach him with only one"
5118,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"transgression, and, if one is to say what one thinks, she has always"
5119,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,appeared to me a little hard on him. Nor does she rest content till she
5120,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"has compelled him to confess his fault. He does so, and then she tells him"
5121,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"to lay aside his grief, and think no more of it, for he is forgiven."
5122,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Perhaps, in mitigation of the feeling that her severity was in excess of"
5123,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"the cause, one ought to remember, since it is peculiarly pertinent to my"
5124,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"theme, that we are in the above harrowing scene presented with the"
5125,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"crowning characteristic of Dante's poetic conception of Woman, that, be"
5126,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"the offence against her what it may, she forgets and forgives."
5127,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
5128,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,It might be interesting on some other occasion to inquire how far Dante's
5129,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"poetic conception of Woman is shared by Poets generally, and by the"
5130,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,greater Poets of our own land in particular. Meanwhile one may affirm that
5131,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"the inquiry would serve to show that it is in substance the same, though"
5132,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"no other Poet, in whatsoever tongue, has extolled and glorified a woman as"
5133,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Dante did Beatrice. But Chaucer, Spenser, Milton, Shakespeare, Scott,"
5134,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Byron, Wordsworth, Shelley, Tennyson, could all be shown, by apposite"
5135,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"illustration, to leave on the mind a conception of woman as a being"
5136,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"tender, devoted, faithful, helpful, ""sweet, and serviceable,"" as Tennyson"
5137,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"says of Elaine, quick to respond to affection, sensitive to beauty in"
5138,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Nature and Arts, sympathising companion alike of the hearth and of man's"
5139,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"struggle with life--in a word, a creature of whom it is true to say, as,"
5140,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"indeed, Byron _has_ said, that ""Love is her whole existence,"" meaning by"
5141,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,Love not what is too frequently in these days falsely presented to us in
5142,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"novels as such, but Love through all the harmonious scale of loving,"
5143,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"maternal, filial, conjugal, romantic, religious, and universal."
5144,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
5145,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,Read then the Poets. They have a nobler conception of woman and of life
5146,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,than the novelists. Their unobtrusive but conspicuous teaching harmonises
5147,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"with the conduct of the best women, and has its deep foundation in a"
5148,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"belief in the beneficent potency of Love, from the most elementary up to"
5149,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,an apprehension of the meaning of the last line of the _Divina Commedia_:
5150,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
5151,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,L'amor che muove il Sole e l'altre stelle.
5152,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,
5153,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,"Love that keeps the sun in its course, and journeys with the planets in"
5154,DANTE'S POETIC CONCEPTION OF WOMAN,their orbit.

5161,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5162,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,The term Pessimism has in these later days been so intimately associated
5163,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"with the philosophical theories of a well-known German writer, that I can"
5164,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"well excuse those who ask, What may be the connection between Pessimism"
5165,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,and Poetry? There are few matters of human interest that may not become
5166,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,suitable themes for poetic treatment; but I scarcely think Metaphysics is
5167,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"among them. It is not, therefore, to Schopenhauer's theory of the World"
5168,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"conceived as Will and Idea, that I invite your attention. The Pessimism"
5169,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"with which we are concerned is much older than Metaphysics, is as old as"
5170,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"the human heart, and is never likely to become obsolete. It is the"
5171,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Pessimism of which the simplest, the least cultured, and the most"
5172,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"unsophisticated of us may become the victims, and which expresses the"
5173,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"feeling that, on the whole, life is rather a bad business, that it is not"
5174,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"worth having, and that it is a thing which, in the language used by the"
5175,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Duke in _Measure for Measure_, in order to console Claudio, none but fools"
5176,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,would keep.
5177,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5178,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Now, as all forms of feeling, and most forms of thought, are reflected in"
5179,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"the magic mirror of Poetry, it is only natural that gloomy views of"
5180,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"existence, of the individual life, and of the world's destiny should from"
5181,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,time to time find expression in the poet's verse. There is quite enough
5182,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"pain in the experience of the individual, quite enough vicissitude in the"
5183,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"history of nations, quite enough doubt and perplexity in the functions and"
5184,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"mission of mankind, for even the most cheerful and masculine Song to"
5185,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,change sometimes into the pathetic minor. What I would ask you to consider
5186,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,with me is if there be not a danger lest poetry should remain for long in
5187,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"this minor key, and if the Poet does not find ample justification and"
5188,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"warrant--nay, should he be a true and comprehensive interpreter of life,"

5191,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"All moods, all passions, all delights,"
5192,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Whatever stirs this mortal frame,"
5193,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5194,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"if he does not find himself compelled, in reply to the question, ""What of"
5195,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"the night?"" to answer, ""The stars are still shining."""
5196,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5197,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,No survey of the attitude of Poetry towards Pessimism would be
5198,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,satisfactory that confined itself to one particular age; and I shall ask
5199,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"you, therefore, to attend to the utterances of poets in other generations"
5200,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"than our own. But, since our own age necessarily interests us the most,"
5201,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,let us at least _begin_ with IT.
5202,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5203,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,I should be surprised to find any one doubting that during the last few
5204,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"years a wave of disillusion, of doubt, misgiving, and despondency has"
5205,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,passed over the world. We are no longer so confident as we were in the
5206,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,abstract wisdom and practical working of our Institutions; we no longer
5207,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,express ourselves with such certainty concerning the social and moral
5208,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,advantages of our material discoveries; we entertain growing anxiety as to
5209,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,the future of our Commerce; many persons have questioned the very
5210,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"foundations of religious belief, and numbers have taken refuge from"
5211,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"conflicting creeds in avowed Agnosticism, or the confession that we know"
5212,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,and can know absolutely nothing concerning what it had long been assumed
5213,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"it most behoves us to know. One by one, all the fondly cherished theories"
5214,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"of life, society and Empire; our belief in Free Trade as the evangelist of"
5215,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"peace, the solution of economic difficulties and struggles, and the sure"
5216,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,foundation of national greatness; all the sources of our satisfaction with
5217,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"ourselves, our confidence in our capacity to reconcile the rivalry of"
5218,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"capital and labour, to repress drunkenness, to abolish pauperism, to form"
5219,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"a fraternal confederation with our Colonies, and to be the example to the"
5220,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"whole world of wealth, wisdom, and virtue, are one by one deserting us. We"
5221,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,no longer believe that Great Exhibitions will disarm the inherent ferocity
5222,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"of mankind, that a judicious administration of the Poor Law will gradually"
5223,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"empty our workhouses, or that an elastic law of Divorce will correct the"
5224,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,aberrations of human passion and solve all the problems of the hearth. The
5225,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"boastfulness, the sanguine expectations, the confident prophecies of olden"
5226,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,times are exchanged for hesitating speculations and despondent whispers.
5227,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"We no longer seem to know whither we are marching, and many appear to"
5228,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,think that we are marching to perdition. We have curtailed the authority
5229,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,of kings; we have narrowed the political competence of aristocracies; we
5230,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"have widened the suffrage, till we can hardly widen it any further; we"
5231,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"have introduced the ballot, abolished bribery and corruption, and called"
5232,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"into play a more active municipal life; we have multiplied our railways,"
5233,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,and the pace of our travel has been greatly accelerated. Telegraph and
5234,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,telephone traverse the land. Surgical operations of the most difficult and
5235,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"dangerous character are performed successfully by the aid of anæsthetics,"
5236,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,without pain to the patient. We have forced from heaven more light than
5237,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,ever Prometheus did; with the result that we transcend him likewise in our
5238,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"pain. No one would assert that we are happier, more cheerful, more full of"
5239,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"hope, than our predecessors, or that we confront the Future with greater"
5240,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"confidence. All our Progress, so far, has ended in Pessimism more or less"
5241,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"pronounced; by some expressed more absolutely, by some with more"
5242,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"moderation; but felt by all, permeating every utterance, and infiltrating"
5243,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,into every stratum of thought.
5244,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5245,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Now let us see to what extent these gloomy views have found expression in
5246,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"poetry, and, first of all, in the writings of not only the most widely"
5247,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"read but the most sensitive and receptive poet of our time, Alfred"
5248,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Tennyson. Tennyson came of age in 1830, or just on the eve of the first"
5249,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Reform Bill, when a great Party in the State, which was to enjoy almost a"
5250,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"monopoly of power for the next thirty years, firmly believed, and was"
5251,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"followed by a majority of the nation in believing, that we had only to"
5252,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"legislate in a generous and what was called a liberal sense, to bring"
5253,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,about the Millennium within a reasonable period. They had every possible
5254,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"opportunity of putting their belief into practice, and they did so with"
5255,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,generous ardour. Now in that year 1830 there appeared what was practically
5256,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Tennyson's first volume; and save in the instance of the short poem
5257,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,beginning
5258,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5259,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"You ask me, why, tho' ill at ease,"
5260,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Within this region I subsist,"
5261,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5262,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"and the somewhat longer but still comparatively brief one, opening with"
5263,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5264,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Love thou thy land, with love far-brought"
5265,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"From out the storied Past,"
5266,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5267,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,there is no reference in it to the political or social condition of the
5268,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"English people. The bulk of the poems had evidently been composed, so to"
5269,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"speak, in the lofty vacuum created by the poet and the artist for himself,"
5270,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"save where, in the lines,"
5271,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5272,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Vex not thou the Poet's mind
5273,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,With thy shallow wit:
5274,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Vex not thou the poet's mind,"
5275,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"For thou canst not fathom it,"
5276,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5277,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,he seemed to be giving the great body of his countrymen notice that they
5278,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"had nothing in common with him, or he with them. And, in the two"
5279,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"exceptions I have named, what is his attitude? You all remember the lines:"
5280,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5281,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"But pamper not a hasty time,"
5282,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Nor feed with vague imaginings
5283,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"The herd, wild hearts and feeble wings"
5284,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,That every sophister can lime.
5285,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5286,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"And so he goes on, through stanzas with which, I am sure, you are"
5287,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"thoroughly familiar, ending with the often-quoted couplet:"
5288,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5289,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Earn well the thrifty months, nor wed"
5290,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Raw Haste, half-sister to Delay."
5291,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5292,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"It would be difficult to find, in verse, a more terse or accurate"
5293,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"embodiment of what, in no Party sense, we may call the Conservative mind,"
5294,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"the Conservative way of looking at things, or a more striking instance of"
5295,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,contemporaneous verse reflecting what had recently been the average public
5296,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,temper of the moment. The England of the years that immediately preceded
5297,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,1830 was an England wearied with the strain and stress of the great war
5298,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"and the mighty agitations of the early part of the century, and now,"
5299,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"craving for repose, was in politics more or less stationary. Therefore in"
5300,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"this earliest volume, of one of the most sensitive and receptive of"
5301,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"writers, we encounter only quiet panegyrics of"
5302,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5303,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"A land of settled government,"
5304,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"A land of just and old renown,"
5305,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Where Freedom slowly broadens down
5306,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,From precedent to precedent.
5307,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5308,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Where Faction seldom gathers head,"
5309,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"But, by degrees to fulness wrought,"
5310,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,The strength of some diffusive thought
5311,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Hath time and space to work and spread.
5312,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5313,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Here we have none of the rebellious political protests of Byron, none of"
5314,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"the iconoclastic fervour of Shelley, none even of the philosophic yearning"
5315,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"of Wordsworth. It was a Conservative, a self-satisfied England, and the"
5316,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"youthful Tennyson accordingly was perfectly well satisfied with it,"
5317,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,evidently having as yet no cognizance of the fact that Radicalism was
5318,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"already more than muling and pewking in the arms of its Whig nurse, and"
5319,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"that Reforms were about to be carried neither ""slowly,"" nor by ""still"
5320,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"degrees,"" nor in accordance with any known ""precedent."""
5321,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5322,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Tennyson's next volume was not published till 1842. During the twelve
5323,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"years that had elapsed since the appearance of its predecessor, a mighty"
5324,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"change had come not only over the dream, but over the practice, of the"
5325,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,English People. It was an England in which the stationary or conservative
5326,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"tone of thought of which I spoke was, if not extinct, discredited and"
5327,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"suppressed, and the fortunes of the Realm were moulded by the generous and"
5328,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,hopeful theories of Liberalism. Tennyson meanwhile had been subjected to
5329,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,the influences of what he called the wondrous Mother Age; and harken how
5330,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"now--it scarcely sounds like the same voice--the eulogist of the ""storied"
5331,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Past,"" the deprecator of ""crude imaginings"" and of a ""hasty time,"""
5332,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,confronts the dominant spirit and rising impulses of the new generation:
5333,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5334,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see,"
5335,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Saw the Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be;"
5336,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5337,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails,"
5338,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Pilots of the purple twilight, dropping down with costly bales;"
5339,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5340,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Far along the world-wide whisper of the south-wind rushing warm,"
5341,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,With the standards of the peoples plunging thro' the thunder-storm;
5342,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5343,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Till the war-drum throbb'd no longer, and the battle-flags were furl'd"
5344,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world."
5345,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5346,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"There the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe,"
5347,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law."
5348,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5349,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Did Optimism ever find a clearer, more enthusiastic, or more confident"
5350,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,voice than that? I have sometimes thought that when the Historian comes to
5351,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"write, in distant times, of the rise, progress, and decline of Liberalism"
5352,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"in England, he will cite that passage as the melodious compendium of its"
5353,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"creed. You all know where the passage comes; for you have, I am sure, the"
5354,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,first _Locksley Hall_ by heart.
5355,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5356,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"But there is another _Locksley Hall_, the _Locksley Hall_ which the Author"
5357,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"himself calls _Locksley Hall Sixty Years After_, published as recently as"
5358,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"1886. You are acquainted with it, no doubt; but I should be surprised to"
5359,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,find any one quite so familiar with it as with its predecessor. It is not
5360,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"so attractive, so fascinating, so saturated with beauty. But for my"
5361,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"purpose it is eminently instructive, and I will ask you to listen to some"
5362,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,of its rolling couplets.
5363,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5364,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Chaos, Cosmos! Cosmos, Chaos! who can tell how all will end?"
5365,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Read the wide world's annals, you, and take their wisdom for your friend."
5366,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5367,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Hope the best, but hold the Present fatal daughter of the Past,"
5368,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Shape your heart to front the hour, but dream not that the hour will last."
5369,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5370,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Ay, if dynamite and revolver leave you courage to be wise:"
5371,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"When was age so cramm'd with menace? madness? written, spoken lies?"
5372,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5373,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Envy wears the mask of Love, and, laughing sober fact to scorn,"
5374,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Cries to Weakest as to Strongest, ""Ye are equals, equal-born."""
5375,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5376,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Equal-born? O yes, if yonder hill be level with the flat."
5377,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Charm us, Orator, till the Lion look no larger than the Cat."
5378,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5379,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Till the Cat thro' that mirage of overheated language loom
5380,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Larger than the Lion,--Demos end in working its own doom."
5381,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5382,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Chaos, Cosmos! Cosmos, Chaos! once again the sickening game;"
5383,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Freedom, free to slay herself, and dying while they shout her name."
5384,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5385,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Step by step we gain'd a freedom known to Europe, known to all;"
5386,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Step by step we rose to greatness,--thro' the tonguesters we may fall."
5387,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5388,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Was there ever such a contrast as between these two _Locksley Halls_? The
5389,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"same poet, the same theme, the same metre, but how different the voice,"
5390,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"the tone, the tendency, the conclusion! All the Liberalism, all the"
5391,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"enthusiasm, the hope, the confidence, of former years have vanished, and"
5392,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,in their place we have reactionary despondency. It is as though the same
5393,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"hand that wrote the Christening Ode to Liberalism, had composed a dirge to"
5394,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,be chanted over its grave.
5395,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5396,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,The genius of Tennyson needs no fresh panegyric. It is but yesterday he
5397,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"died, in the fullness of his Fame; and that his works will be read so long"
5398,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"as the English language remains a living tongue, I cannot doubt. But if,"
5399,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,while his claim to the very highest place as an artist must ever remain
5400,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"uncontested, doubts should be expressed concerning his equality with the"
5401,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"very greatest poets, those who express that doubt will, I imagine, base"
5402,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"their challenge on the excessive receptivity, and consequent lack of"
5403,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,serenity of his mind. In the first _Locksley Hall_ the poet is an
5404,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Optimist. In the second _Locksley Hall_ he is a Pessimist. And why?
5405,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Because, when the first was written, the prevailing tone of the age was"
5406,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"optimistic; and, when the second was composed, the prevailing tone of the"
5407,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,time had become pessimistic.
5408,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5409,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"It will scarcely be doubted, therefore, that there does exist a real and a"
5410,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"very grave danger lest Poetry should, in these perplexing and despondent"
5411,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"days, not only be closely associated with Pessimism, but should become for"
5412,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,the most part its voice and echo. I am precluded from presenting to you
5413,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,illustrations of this danger from the works of living writers of verse.
5414,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"But in truth, the malady of which I am speaking--for malady, in my"
5415,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"opinion, it is--began to manifest itself long before the present"
5416,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"generation, long before Tennyson wrote, and when indeed he was yet a child"
5417,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,in the cradle. The main original source of Modern Pessimism is the French
5418,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"movement known as the Revolution, which, by exciting extravagant hopes as"
5419,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,to the happy results to be secured from the emancipation of the
5420,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"individual, at first generated a fretful impatience at the apparently slow"
5421,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"fulfilment of the dream, and finally aroused a sceptical and reactionary"
5422,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,despondency at the only too plain and patent demonstration that the dream
5423,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,was not going to be fulfilled at all. It is this blending of wild hopes
5424,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,and extravagant impatience that inspired and informed the poetry of
5425,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Shelley, that produced _Queen Mab_, _The Revolt of Islam_, and _Prometheus"
5426,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Unbound_. In Byron it was impatience blent with disillusion that dictated
5427,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"_Childe Harold_, _Manfred_, and _Cain_, and finally culminated in the"
5428,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"mockery of _Don Juan_. Keats, while ostensibly holding aloof from the"
5429,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"political and social issues of his time, succumbed and ministered to the"
5430,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"disease, even if unconsciously and unintentionally, more even than either"
5431,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Byron or Shelley; for _they_ went on fighting against, while _he_"
5432,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"passively submitted, to it. Keats found nothing in his own time worth"
5433,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"sympathising with or singing about, and so took refuge in mythological and"
5434,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"classical themes, or in the expression of states of feeling in which he"
5435,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"grows half in love with easeful death, in which more than ever it seems"
5436,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"sweet to die and to cease upon the midnight with no pain, and to the high"
5437,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,requiem of the nightingale to become a sod that does not hear.
5438,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5439,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Now it is an instructive circumstance that, in recent years, a distinct"
5440,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,and decided preference has been manifested both by the majority of critics
5441,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,and by the reading public for the poetry of Keats even over the poetry of
5442,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"the other two writers I have named in connection with him. In Byron,"
5443,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"notwithstanding his rebellious tendency, notwithstanding the gloom that"
5444,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"often overshadows his verse, notwithstanding his being one of the"
5445,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,exponents of those exaggerated hopes and that exaggerated despondency of
5446,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"which I have spoken, there was a considerable fund of common sense and a"
5447,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,good deal of manliness. He was a man of the world and could not help being
5448,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"so, in spite of his attitude of hostility to it. Moreover, in many of his"
5449,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"poems, action plays a conspicuous part, and the general passions,"
5450,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"interests, and politics of mankind are dealt with by him in a more or less"
5451,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"practical spirit, and as though they concerned him likewise. Shelley, too,"
5452,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"not unoften condescended to deal with the political, social, and religious"
5453,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"polemics of his time, though he always did so in a passionate and utterly"
5454,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"impracticable temper, and would necessarily leave on the mind of the"
5455,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"reader, the conviction that everything in the world is amiss, and that"
5456,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,the only possible remedy is the abolition of everything that had hitherto
5457,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,been regarded as an indispensable part of the foundation of human society.
5458,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,But Keats does not trouble himself about any of these things. He gives
5459,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"them the go-by, he ignores them, and only asks to be allowed to leave the"
5460,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"world unseen, and with the nightingale, to fade away into the forest dim."
5461,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5462,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget"
5463,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"What thou among the leaves hast never known,"
5464,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"The weariness, the fever, and the fret"
5465,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Here, where men sit and hear each other groan;"
5466,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs,"
5467,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;"
5468,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Where but to think is to be full of sorrow
5469,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,And leaden-eyed despairs;
5470,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Where beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,"
5471,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.
5472,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5473,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"This is the voice, I say, which, during the last few years, has been"
5474,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"preferred even to Shelley's, and very much preferred to Byron's. And why?"
5475,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,You will perhaps say that Keats's workmanship is fascinatingly beautiful.
5476,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"In the passage I have cited, and in the entire poem from which it is"
5477,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"taken, that unquestionably is so. But I trust I shall not give offence if"
5478,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,I say that the number of my countrymen and countrywomen who lay stress on
5479,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"the artistic manner, whether in verse or prose, in which an opinion is"
5480,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"expressed, compared with the number of those who value poetry or prose"
5481,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,chiefly because it expresses the opinions they value and the sentiments
5482,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"they cherish, is very small. No, Keats is preferred because Keats turns"
5483,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"aside from the world at large, and thinks and writes only of individual"
5484,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"feeling. Hence he has been more welcomed by recent critics, and by recent"
5485,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"readers of poetry. Indeed, certain critics have laboured to erect it into"
5486,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"a dogma, indeed into an absolute literary and critical canon, that a poet"
5487,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"who wishes to attain true distinction must turn his back on politics, on"
5488,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"people, on society, on his country, on patriotism, on everything in fact"
5489,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"save books--his own thoughts, his own feelings, and his own art. Because"
5490,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Byron did not do so they have dubbed him a Philistine; and because Pope
5491,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"did precisely the reverse, and the reverse, no doubt, overmuch, they"
5492,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,assert that he was not a poet at all.
5493,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5494,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"It is not necessary to dwell on the fatuousness of such criticism, more"
5495,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,especially as one discerns welcome signs of a disposition on the part of
5496,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"the reading public to turn away from these guides, and a disposition even"
5497,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,on the part of the guides themselves in some degree to reconsider and
5498,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,revise their unfortunate utterances. But I have alluded to the doctrine in
5499,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"question, in order to show you to what lengths Pessimism, which is only a"
5500,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"compendious expression of dissatisfaction with things in general, in other"
5501,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"words with life, with society, and with mankind, can go, and how it has"
5502,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"culminated in such disdain of them by poets, that they brush them aside as"
5503,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,subjects unworthy of the Muse. Surely Pessimism in Poetry can no farther
5504,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"go, than to assume, without question, that man, life, society, patriotism"
5505,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,are not worth a song?
5506,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5507,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"I should not wonder if some will have been saying to themselves, ""But what"
5508,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"about Wordsworth; Wordsworth, who was the contemporary, and at least the"
5509,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"equal, alike in genius and in influence, of the three poets just named?"" I"
5510,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"have not forgotten Wordsworth. Wordsworth was of too pious a temperament,"
5511,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"using the word pious in its very largest signification, to be a Pessimist;"
5512,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"for true piety and Pessimism are irreconcilable. Nevertheless Wordsworth,"
5513,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"as a poet, likewise experienced, and experienced acutely, the influence of"
5514,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,the French Revolution. Upon this point there can be no difference of
5515,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,opinion; for he himself left it on record in a well-known passage.
5516,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Everybody knows with what different eyes Wordsworth finally looked on the
5517,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"French Revolution; how utterly he broke with its tenets, its promises, its"
5518,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,offspring; taking refuge from his disappointment.
5519,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5520,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"But something akin to despondency, if too permeated with sacred"
5521,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"resignation wholly to deserve that description, may be discovered in the"
5522,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"attitude henceforward assumed by Wordsworth, as a poet, towards the world,"
5523,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"society, and mankind. Not only did he write a long poem, _The Recluse_,"
5524,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"but he himself was a recluse, and the whole of _The Excursion_ is the"
5525,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"composition of a recluse. Matthew Arnold, always a high authority on"
5526,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Wordsworth, has said:"
5527,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5528,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,But Wordsworth's eyes avert their ken
5529,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,From half of human fate.
5530,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5531,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Indeed they did; turning instead to the silence that is in the sky, to the"
5532,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"sleep that is in the hills, to the mountains, the flowers, and the poet's"
5533,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,own solitary _meditations_. He declared that he would rather be a Pagan
5534,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"suckled in a creed outworn than one of those Christian worldlings, of"
5535,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,which society seemed to him mainly to consist. This is not necessarily
5536,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Pessimism. But it goes perilously near to it; and the boundary line would
5537,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"have been crossed, but that Wordsworth's prayer was answered, in which he"
5538,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,petitioned that his days might be linked each to each by natural piety.
5539,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5540,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Of Matthew Arnold himself, as a poet, I am able to speak; for though he"
5541,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"was not long ago one's contemporary, he is no longer one of ourselves. In"
5542,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Matthew Arnold it has always seemed to me, the poet and the man, his"
5543,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"reason and his imagination, were not quite one. They were harnessed"
5544,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"together rather than incorporated one with the other; and, many years"
5545,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"before he died, if I may press the comparison a little farther, the poet,"
5546,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"the imaginative part of him became lame and halt, and he conveyed his mind"
5547,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,in the humbler one-horse vehicle of prose. The poetic impulse in him was
5548,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,not strong enough to carry him along permanently against the prosaic
5549,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"opposition of life. Nevertheless, he was a poet who wrote some very"
5550,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"beautiful poetry; and he exercised a powerful influence, both as a poet"
5551,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"and as a prose-writer, on the thoughts and sentiments of his time. Now,"
5552,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,what do we find him saying? Listen!
5553,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5554,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Wandering between two worlds, one dead,"
5555,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"The other powerless to be born,"
5556,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"With nowhere yet to rest my head,"
5557,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Like these, on earth I wait forlorn."
5558,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Their faith, My tears, the world deride,"
5559,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,I come to shed them at your side.
5560,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5561,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"There yet perhaps may dawn an age,"
5562,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"More fortunate alas! than we,"
5563,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Which without hardness will be sage,"
5564,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,And gay without frivolity.
5565,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Sons of the world, oh haste those years!"
5566,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"But, till they rise, allow our tears."
5567,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5568,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Hark to the words he puts into the mouth of Empedocles:
5569,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5570,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"And yet what days were those, Parmenides!"
5571,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Then we could still enjoy, then neither thought"
5572,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Nor outward things were closed and dead to us;
5573,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,But we received the shock of mighty thoughts
5574,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,On simple minds with a pure natural joy.
5575,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5576,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,*       *       *       *       *
5577,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5578,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"We had not lost our balance then, nor grown"
5579,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Thought's slaves, and dead to every natural joy."
5580,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5581,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,In another poem he declares:
5582,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5583,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Achilles ponders in his tent:
5584,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,The Kings of modern thought are dumb;
5585,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Silent they are, though not content,"
5586,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,And wait to see the future come.
5587,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5588,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,*       *       *       *       *
5589,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5590,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Our fathers watered with their tears
5591,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,The sea of time whereon we sail;
5592,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Their voices were in all men's ears
5593,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Who passed within their puissant hail.
5594,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Still the same ocean round us raves,"
5595,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,But we stand mute and watch the waves.
5596,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5597,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Last and worst of all, and in utter despondency and pessimism he cries:"
5598,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5599,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Your creeds are dead, your rites are dead,"
5600,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Your social order, too!"
5601,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Where tarries He, the Power who said,"
5602,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"_See_, I make all things new?"
5603,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"... The past is out of date,"
5604,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,The future not yet born;
5605,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"And who can be alone elate,"
5606,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,While the world lies forlorn?
5607,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5608,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Can Pessimism in Poetry go farther than that? Many will perhaps think it
5609,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"cannot; but, unfortunately, it can. It is only from poets who are dead, if"
5610,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"dead but recently, that one can draw one's illustrations; otherwise I"
5611,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"could suggest you should read to yourselves volume upon volume of verse,"
5612,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,the one long weary burden of which is the misery of being alive. I daresay
5613,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,you will not be sorry that one is precluded from introducing these
5614,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,melancholy minstrels. But the spirit that imbues and pervades them is
5615,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,compendiously and conveniently expressed in a composition that I _can_
5616,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"read to you, and which I select because it seems to express, in reasonably"
5617,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"small compass, the indictment which our metrical pessimists labour to"
5618,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,bring against existence.
5619,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5620,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"I have confined my survey entirely to poets of our own land, and have said"
5621,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"nothing to you of Giacomo Leopardi, the celebrated Italian Pessimistic"
5622,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Poet; nothing of Heine, whose beautiful but too often cynical lyrics must"
5623,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"be known to you either in the original German, or in one or other of the"
5624,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"various English versions, into which they have been rendered; nothing of"
5625,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"the long procession of railers, sometimes bestial, nearly always"
5626,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"repulsive, in French verse, beginning with Baudelaire, and coming down to"
5627,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,the _petits crevés_ of poetry who are not ashamed to be known by the name
5628,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"of _décadens_, and who certainly deserve it, for if they possess nothing"
5629,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"else, they possess to perfection the art of sinking. One would naturally"
5630,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"expect to find in the country where occurred the French Revolution, the"
5631,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"most violent forms of the malady which, as I have said, is mainly"
5632,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,attributable to it; and surely it is a strong confirmation of the truth of
5633,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,that theory that it is in France poetic pessimism has in our day had its
5634,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,most outrageous and most voluminous expression.
5635,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5636,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"I hope no one supposes that I am, even incidentally, intending to"
5637,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,pronounce a sweeping and unqualified condemnation of the great movement
5638,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,known in history as the French Revolution. That would indeed be to be as
5639,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,narrow as the narrowest pessimist could possibly show himself. The French
5640,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Revolution, as is probably the case with every great political, religious,"
5641,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"or social movement, was in its action partly beneficial, partly"
5642,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"detrimental. It abolished many monstrous abuses, it propounded afresh some"
5643,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,long-neglected or violated truths; and it gave a vigorous impulse to human
5644,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,hope. But it was perhaps the most violent of all the great movements
5645,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"recorded in human annals. Accordingly, it destroyed over much, and it"
5646,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"promised over much. In all probability, action and reaction are as nicely"
5647,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"balanced in the intellectual and moral world as in the physical, and"
5648,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,exaggerated hopes must have their equivalent in correlated and co-equal
5649,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,disappointment. I sometimes think that the nineteenth century now closed
5650,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"will be regarded in the fullness of time as a colossal egotist, that began"
5651,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"by thinking somewhat too highly of itself, its prospects, its capacity,"
5652,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"its performances, and ended by thinking somewhat too meanly of what I have"
5653,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"called things in general, or those permanent conditions of man, life, and"
5654,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"society, which no amount of Revolutions, French or otherwise, will avail"
5655,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,to get rid of.
5656,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5657,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"In truth, if I were asked to say briefly what Pessimism is, I should say"
5658,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"it is disappointed Egotism; and the description will hold good, whether we"
5659,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"apply it to an individual, to a community, or to an age."
5660,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5661,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,For nothing is more remarkable in the writings of pessimistic poets than
5662,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"the attention they devote, and that they ask us to devote, to their own"
5663,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,feelings. Far be it from me to deny that some very lovely and very
5664,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"valuable verse has been written by poets concerning their personal joys,"
5665,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"sorrows, hopes, longings, and disappointments. But then it is verse which"
5666,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"describes the joys, sorrows, hopes, longings, and disappointments common"
5667,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"to the whole human race, and which every sensitive nature experiences at"
5668,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"some time or another, in the course of chequered life, and which are"
5669,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"peculiar to no particular age or generation, but the pathetic possession"
5670,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"of all men, and all epochs. The verse to which I allude with less"
5671,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"commendation, is the verse in which the writer seems to be occupied, and"
5672,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"asking us to occupy ourselves, with exceptional states of suffering which"
5673,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"appertain to him alone, or to him and the little esoteric circle of"
5674,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"superior martyrs to which he belongs, and to some special period of"
5675,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,history in which their lot is cast. The sorrows we entertain in common
5676,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"with others never lead to pessimism, they lead to pity, sympathy, pathos,"
5677,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"to pious resignation, to courageous hope. I wish these privileged invalids"
5678,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,would take to heart those noble lines of Wordsworth:
5679,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5680,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,So once it would have been--'tis so no more--
5681,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,I have submitted to a new control--
5682,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"A power is gone which nothing can restore,"
5683,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,A deep distress hath humanized my soul!
5684,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5685,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,I sometimes think these doleful bards have never had a really deep
5686,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"distress, that their very woe is fanciful, and that like the young"
5687,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"gentleman in France of whom Arthur speaks in _King John_, they are as sad"
5688,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"as night, only for wantonness. But far from being rebuked by critics for"
5689,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"their sea-green melancholy, they have been hailed as true masters of song"
5690,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,for scarcely any better reason than that they declare themselves to be
5691,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"utterly miserable, and life to be equally so. Indeed by some critics it"
5692,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"has been raised into a literary canon, not only that all Poetry, to be of"
5693,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"much account, must be written in the pathetic minor, but that the poets"
5694,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"themselves, if we are to recognise them as endowed with true genius and"
5695,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"real sacred fire, must be unhappy from the cradle to the grave. If they"
5696,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"can die young, if they can go mad, or commit suicide, so much the better."
5697,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Their credentials as great poets are then firmly established. Even a
5698,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,pathetic phrase has been invented to describe the natural and inevitable
5699,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"condition of such sacred persons, a phrase that must be well known to"
5700,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,you--the Sorrows of Genius.
5701,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5702,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Therefore, in the really sacred name of Genius, of Literature, of Poetry,"
5703,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"I protest against this pitiable, this mawkish, unmanly, unwholesome, and"
5704,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,utterly untrue estimate both of poetry and poets. No first-rate poet ever
5705,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"went mad, or ever committed suicide, though one or two, no doubt, have"
5706,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"happened to die comparatively young. It is utterly dishonouring to poets,"
5707,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"it is utterly discrediting to men of genius, to represent them as feeble,"
5708,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"whining, helpless, love-sick, life-sick invalids, galvanised from time to"
5709,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,time into activity by a sort of metrical hysteria. Because Shelley has
5710,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,truly said that
5711,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5712,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Our sweetest songs are those which tell of saddest thought
5713,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5714,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,--and because in _Julian and Maddalo_ he has represented Byron as saying
5715,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,that men
5716,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5717,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,... learn in suffering what they teach in song
5718,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5719,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,--are we to conclude that sadness and suffering are the only things in
5720,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"life, the only things in it deserving of the poet's music? No one will"
5721,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"ever be a poet of much consequence who has not suffered, for, as Goethe"
5722,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"finely says, he who never ate his bread in sorrow, knows not the Heavenly"
5723,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Powers. But, if our sweetest songs are those which tell of saddest"
5724,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"thought, they are not necessarily our strongest or our greatest songs; and"
5725,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,if we accept the assertion that men learn in suffering what they teach in
5726,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"song, do not let us forget the ""learning"" spoken of in the line. The poet,"
5727,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"no doubt, has to learn by suffering, but having learnt, he has then, in my"
5728,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"opinion, to help others not to be miserable, but to be happy."
5729,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5730,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"I cannot here allude to well-known poets of other ages and other nations,"
5731,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"avowedly great and permanent benefactors of mankind, all of whom alike"
5732,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,were completely free from this malady of universal discontent. But let me
5733,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"at least take a cursory survey of our native poets; for, after all, to us"
5734,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"English men and English women, what English poets have felt and said"
5735,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,concerns us most and interests us most deeply. Let us see what is their
5736,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"attitude to external nature, to man, woman, life, society, and the general"
5737,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,dispensation of existence.
5738,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5739,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"You know how our modern pessimists cannot see a tree, a flower, or a"
5740,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"mountain, but straightway they drop into what I may call a falling"
5741,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"sickness, and all the beauty of the woods, fields, and sky merely suggests"
5742,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,to them a picturesque background for their own superior sighs and sorrows.
5743,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,How differently Chaucer looks upon the panorama of this fair earth of
5744,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"ours! He is a great student, as men in the early days of the Renaissance"
5745,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"were, and he tells us that he hath such delight in reading books, and has"
5746,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"in his heart for them such reverence, that there is no game which can tear"
5747,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"him away from them. But, when the month of May comes, and the birds sing,"
5748,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"and the flowers begin to shoot, then, he adds, ""Farewell my book and my"
5749,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"devotion!"" He wanders forth and beholds the eye of the daisy; and this"
5750,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"blissful sight, as he calls it, softeneth all his sorrow. Elsewhere he"
5751,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,describes how he cannot lie in bed for the glad beams of the sun that pour
5752,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"in through the window. He rushes out, and is delighted with everything."
5753,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"The welkin is fair, the air blue and light, it is neither too hot nor too"
5754,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"cold, and not a cloud is anywhere to be seen. This disposition of content"
5755,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"with and joy in external Nature, Chaucer displays equally when he consorts"
5756,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"with his kind. It is very noticeable, though I am not aware if it has been"
5757,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"pointed out before, how he portrays all the various pilgrims and"
5758,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,personages in the famous _Prologue to the Canterbury Tales_ as of cheerful
5759,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"and generally jovial spirits. There is not a melancholy person, not a"
5760,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"pessimist, in the whole company. He describes himself as talking and"
5761,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"having fellowship with every one of them, and we may therefore conclude he"
5762,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"also was pretty cheerful and genial himself. Even of his ""perfect gentle"
5763,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"knight,"" whom he evidently intended to describe as the pink of chivalry,"
5764,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,he says:
5765,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5766,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"And though that he was worthy, he was wise."
5767,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5768,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"And there never was, and never will be, wisdom without cheerfulness. As"
5769,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"for the young Squire, the lover and lusty bachelor, that accompanied the"
5770,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Knight, Chaucer says of him, in a couplet that has always struck me as"
5771,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,possessing a peculiar charm:
5772,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5773,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Singing he was or fluting all the day,"
5774,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,He was as merry as the month of May.
5775,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5776,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"He says of him, though he could sit a horse well, he could also write"
5777,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,songs; and we can easily surmise what the songs were like. Chaucer's Nun
5778,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"or Prioress is delineated by him as full pleasant and amiable of port, and"
5779,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,as even taking trouble to feign the cheerful air of a lady of the Court.
5780,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"When the Monk rides abroad, men could hear his bridle jingling in a"
5781,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,whistling wind as clear and loud as the chapel bell. Do not the words stir
5782,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"one's blood to cheerfulness, and sound like a very carillon of joy? Of the"
5783,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Friar it is recorded that certainly he had a merry note, and well could he"
5784,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"sing and play upon the harp, and that while he sang and played, his eyes"
5785,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"twinkled in his head, like stars in the frosty night. The business of the"
5786,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Clerk of Oxenford was by his speech to sow abroad moral virtue; but
5787,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Chaucer adds, ""And gladly would he learn--"" mark that word ""gladly"" ""--and"
5788,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"gladly teach."" The Franklin, a country gentleman, he declares, was wont to"
5789,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"live in delight, for he was Epicurus' own son. The Shipman draws many a"
5790,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,draught of wine from Bordeaux; well can the wife of Bath laugh and jest;
5791,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,the Miller is a regular joker and buffoon; a better fellow you cannot
5792,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"find, he avers, than the Sumpnor; and the Pardoner, for very jollity, goes"
5793,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"bareheaded, singing full merrily and loud. As for the Landlord of the"
5794,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"""Tabard,"" he is described as making great cheer, being a right merry man."
5795,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"He declares there is no comfort nor mirth in riding to Canterbury, even on"
5796,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"pilgrimage, as dumb as a stone, and that they may smite off his head if he"
5797,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,does not succeed in making them merry; and it all ends by Chaucer
5798,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"declaring that every wight was blithe and glad. Indeed, these are such a"
5799,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"cheery, such a jovial set, that the only sorrow we can feel in connection"
5800,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"with them is regret that we, too, were not of that delightful company."
5801,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5802,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"I wonder if it has occurred to you, while reading these brief and cursory"
5803,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"extracts from Chaucer, to say to yourselves, ""How English it all is!"" If"
5804,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"not, may I say it for you? I am free to confess that I am one of those who"
5805,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,think--and I hope there are some in this room who share my opinion--that
5806,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"the epithet English is an epithet to be proud of, an adjective of praise,"
5807,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"a mark of commendation, and connotes, as the logician would say,"
5808,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"everything that is manly, brave, wholesome, and sane. These latter-day"
5809,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"melancholy moping minstrels are not English at all, they are feeble copies"
5810,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,of foreign originals. Between them and Chaucer there is absolute
5811,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"alienation. About them there is nothing jolly or jovial, and there is not"
5812,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,one good fellow among them.
5813,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5814,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Let us turn to the next great name according to chronological order in
5815,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"English Poetry; let us glance, if but rapidly, at the pages of Spenser."
5816,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,You could not well have two poets of more different dispositions than
5817,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Chaucer and Spenser. One seems to hear Chaucer's own bridle jingling in a
5818,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"whistling wind, to see his own eyes twinkling in his head like stars in"
5819,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"the frosty night, and one thinks of him, too, as singing or fluting all"
5820,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"the day long and being as merry as the month of May. In the gaze, on the"
5821,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"brow, and in the pages of Spenser, there abides a lofty dignity, as of a"
5822,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"high-born stately gentleman, deferential to all, but familiar with none."
5823,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Indeed he resembles his own Gentle Knight in the opening lines of the
5824,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"_Fairy Queen_, the description of whom I have always thought is none other"
5825,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,than the portraiture of himself. If ever a poet had high seriousness it is
5826,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Spenser. He never condescends to indulge in the broad jests dear to
5827,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Chaucer, frequent in Shakespeare, common in Byron. Yet between him and"
5828,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Chaucer, between him and every great poet, there is this similarity, that"
5829,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"he looks on life with a cheerful mind. It is a grave cheerfulness, but"
5830,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"cheerfulness all the same; and, in truth, cheerful gravity, and high"
5831,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,seriousness are one and the same thing.
5832,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5833,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Full jolly Knight he seemed, and fair did sit,"
5834,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,As one for Knightly jousts and fierce encounters fit!
5835,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5836,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"he says in the very first stanza of his noble poem. ""Jolly,"" no doubt,"
5837,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,does not mean quite the same thing with Spenser as it does with Chaucer.
5838,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"There is the difference in signification, we may say, that there is, in"
5839,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"character, between the Landlord of the ""Tabard"" and the Gentle Knight. But"
5840,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"never does the latter lapse into melancholy, much less into Pessimism. He"
5841,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"is too active, on too great adventure bound, and too impressed with its"
5842,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"solemn importance, for that. Spenser himself significantly expresses the"
5843,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,fear that his Gentle Knight
5844,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5845,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Of his cheer did seem too solemn sad,"
5846,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5847,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,as though he wished to let us know that even solemn sadness is a fault.
5848,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"But he soon enables us to discern that appearance is misleading, and"
5849,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"reflects in reality only a noble, lofty, and serene temper, and that"
5850,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"desire to win the worship and favour of the Fairy Queen, which he tells"
5851,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"us, ""of all earthly things, the Knight most did crave."" As soon as Spenser"
5852,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"has described the lovely lady that rode the Knight beside, he says:"
5853,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5854,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"And forth they pass, with _pleasure_ forward led."
5855,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5856,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,And again
5857,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5858,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Led with _delight_, they thus beguile the way."
5859,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5860,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"There is no buffoonery, as in the _Canterbury Tales_, but a wise equable"
5861,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"serenity that contemplates man and woman, beauty, temptation, danger,"
5862,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"sorrow, struggle, honour, this world and the next, with a Knightly"
5863,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"equanimity that nothing can disturb. But why should I dwell on the point,"
5864,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,when Spenser himself has written one line which I may call his confession
5865,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,of faith on the subject?--
5866,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5867,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,The noblest mind the best contentment has.
5868,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5869,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"What a noble line! the noblest, I think, in all literature. Let us commit"
5870,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"it to heart, repeat it morning, noon, and night, and it will cast out for"
5871,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"us all the devils, aye, all the swine of Pessimism. What does this grave,"
5872,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"this serious, this dignified English poet say of the Muses themselves?--"
5873,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5874,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"The Sisters Nine, which dwell on Parnass' height,"
5875,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Do make them music for their more delight!
5876,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5877,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"That is Spenser's conception of the mission of poetry, and of the function"
5878,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,of the poet--to make them music for their more delight--I acknowledge it
5879,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,is mine. I earnestly trust it is that of many.
5880,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5881,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"There is no passion of the human heart, no speculation of the human mind,"
5882,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"to which Shakespeare has not, in some passage or another, given expressive"
5883,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"utterance; and since in life there is much sorrow, no little suffering,"
5884,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"and ample sadness, chapter and verse can readily be found in his universal"
5885,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"pages for any mood or any state of feeling. But what is the one, broad,"
5886,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,final impression we receive of the gaze with which Shakespeare looked on
5887,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,life? A complete answer to that question would furnish matter for a long
5888,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,paper. But one brief passage must here suffice. In the most terrible and
5889,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"tragic of all his tragedies, _King Lear_, and in the most terrible and"
5890,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"tragic of all its appalling incidents, the following brief colloquy takes"
5891,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,place between Edgar and his now sightless father:
5892,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5893,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Away, old man; give me thy hand; away!"
5894,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en:"
5895,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Give me thy hand, come on."
5896,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"No farther, sir,"
5897,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5898,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"replies Gloster in despair,"
5899,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5900,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"No farther, sir! A man may rot even here."
5901,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5902,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,What is Edgar's answer?--
5903,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5904,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,What! In ill thoughts again? Men must endure
5905,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Their going hence, even as their coming hither,"
5906,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,Ripeness is all: come on!
5907,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5908,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"If, at such a moment, and in the very darkest hour of disaster,"
5909,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Shakespeare puts such language into the mouth of Edgar, is it wonderful"
5910,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"that he should, in less gloomy moments, take so cheerful a view of life,"
5911,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"that Milton can only describe his utterances by calling them ""woodnotes"
5912,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"wild""?"
5913,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5914,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,And Milton himself? Milton almost as grave as Spenser and certainly more
5915,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"austere. Yet I do not think that Pessimism, that the advocates of"
5916,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"universal suicide, since life is not worth living, will be able to get"
5917,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,much help or sanction for their doleful gospel from the poet who wrote
5918,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,_Paradise Lost_ expressly to
5919,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5920,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,... assert Eternal Providence
5921,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,And justify the ways of God to man.
5922,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5923,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Milton has given us, in two of the loveliest lyrics in the language, his"
5924,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,conception of Melancholy and of Joy. Of his _L'Allegro_ I need not speak.
5925,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"But in _Il Penseroso_, if anywhere in Milton, we must look for some"
5926,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,utterance akin to the desolation and the despair of modern pessimistic
5927,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"poets. We may look, but assuredly we shall not find it."
5928,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5929,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Then let the pealing organ blow,"
5930,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,To the full-voicëd choir below.
5931,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,
5932,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"In protesting, therefore, against Pessimism in Poetry, I am only returning"
5933,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"to the oldest, soundest, and noblest traditions in English Literature, and"
5934,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,in the English character. I trust no one supposes I am denying or that I
5935,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"am insensible to the existence of pain, woe, sadness, loss, even anguish"
5936,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"and acute suffering, as integral and inevitable elements in life; and if"
5937,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"poetry did not take note of these, and give to them pathetic and adequate"
5938,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"expression, poetry would not be, as it is, coextensive with life, would"
5939,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"not be the Paraclete or Comforter, with the gift of tongues. In poetry the"
5940,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"note of sorrow will be, and must be, occasionally, and indeed frequently"
5941,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"struck; it should not be the dominant key, much less the only key in which"
5942,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,the poet tunes his song. There is much in our modern civilisation that is
5943,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"very unbeautiful, nay, that is downright ugly, whether we look on it with"
5944,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"the eye of the artist or with the vision of the moralist. Moreover, I"
5945,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,perceive--who could fail to perceive?--that we have in these days some
5946,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,very dark and difficult social problems to solve. Then let the poet come
5947,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"to our assistance by accompanying us with musical encouragement. For,"
5948,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"remember, the poet has to make harmony, not out of language only, but out"
5949,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"of life as well. I was once looking at a violin, a very lovely violin, a"
5950,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"Stradivarius of great value and exquisite tone, and I asked the lady to"
5951,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,whom it belonged of what wood the various parts of the instrument was
5952,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"composed. She told me, with much loving detail; but, she said, ""I ought to"
5953,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,add that I have been told no violin can be made of supreme quality unless
5954,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"the wood be taken from that side of the tree which faces south."" It is the"
5955,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"same with the Poet. If he is to give us the sweetest, the most sonorous,"
5956,POETRY AND PESSIMISM,"and the truest notes, his nature must have a bias towards the sunny side."

5963,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"[This paper appeared in _Macmillan's Magazine_ a quarter of a century ago,"
5964,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,in reply to one that had been published in the same periodical in the
5965,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,previous month.]
5966,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
5967,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
5968,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"In the days of Chivalry, whose spirit, I trust, still lingers with us,"
5969,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"though its forms may have passed away, the prelude to a peaceful"
5970,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"tournament, or _joute de plaisance_, was the salutation of each other by"
5971,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,the combatants. In the pages which follow an effort will be made in some
5972,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,degree to dislodge Mr. Swinburne from that seat of critical judgment which
5973,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"he occupies with such gallant confidence, with such waving of plume and"
5974,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"such clashing of shield. But before the lists are opened, let me salute,"
5975,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"with something more than ceremonial courtesy, the exquisite lyrical genius"
5976,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"of the poet, and the solid accomplishments of the scholar. That premised,"
5977,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"I will, without further preliminary, betake me to my task."
5978,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
5979,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"In the latest number of one of the ablest of monthly reviews, Mr."
5980,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Swinburne, enlarging on a passage, rather cursory and incidental than"
5981,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"definitive or judicial, inserted by M. Taine at the close of his brilliant"
5982,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"survey of English poetry, institutes a comparison between Mr. Tennyson and"
5983,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,Alfred de Musset. With Mr. Swinburne's opening remark every one must
5984,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"agree. It is distinctive of this age, he says, that the greatest of the"
5985,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"great writers who were born about the opening of the century, are still"
5986,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,working with splendid persistence. It was affirmed by Menander that those
5987,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"the gods love die young. Is it because the gods themselves are dead, that"
5988,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,the heavenly favourites are nowadays permitted to exceed even the
5989,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"scriptural span of life? Be this as it may, to Mr. Tennyson, with peculiar"
5990,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"aptness, may be addressed the lines of Wordsworth, inspired by a very"
5991,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,different personage:
5992,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
5993,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Thy thoughts and feelings shall not die,"
5994,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Nor leave thee when gray hairs are nigh,"
5995,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,A melancholy slave;
5996,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"But an old age serene and bright,"
5997,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"And lovely as a Lapland night,"
5998,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,Shall lead thee to thy grave.
5999,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6000,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"More appropriate still perhaps, for the moment, would be an excerpt from"
6001,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Alfred de Musset himself, whom the gods loved not well enough either to"
6002,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"cut off in the flower of his youth, or to leave hanging till he had"
6003,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"achieved maturity. Mr. Swinburne, no doubt, knows the lines by heart:"
6004,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6005,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Mais comment fais-tu donc, vieux maître"
6006,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,Pour renaître?

6018,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,Dans les fleurs.
6019,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6020,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"To this survival of power in Mr. Tennyson, Mr. Swinburne pays homage after"
6021,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"his fashion. Who could possibly withhold it? _The ""Revenge,""_ _The Battle"
6022,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"of Lucknow_, and most of all _Rizpah_, show that, even as in the days of"
6023,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"_Locksley Hall_, ancient founts of inspiration well through Mr. Tennyson's"
6024,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,fancy yet; serving to remind us that Nature rejoices in the occasional
6025,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"violation of her own laws, that roses are not altogether unknown in"
6026,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"November, and that even when the snowdrop whitens the ground, the lark"
6027,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,will sometimes carol up to heaven.
6028,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6029,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,To the wedded strength and sadness in _Rizpah_ Mr. Swinburne offers ample
6030,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"testimony, and this is how he does it:"
6031,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6032,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Nothing more piteous, more passionate, more adorable for intensity of"
6033,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"beauty, was ever before this wrought by human cunning into the"
6034,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"likeness of such words, as words are powerless to praise. Any"
6035,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,possible commentary on a poem of this rank must needs be as weak and
6036,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,worthless as the priceless thing which evoked it is beautiful and
6037,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,strong.
6038,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6039,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"I confess I am disposed to feel that this is so. But Mr. Swinburne,"
6040,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"disregarding his candid avowal of what is worthless, proceeds with the"
6041,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,commentary:
6042,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6043,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"But one which should attempt by selection or indication to underline,"
6044,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"as it were, and to denote the chiefest among its manifold beauties"
6045,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"and glories, would be also as long and as wordy as the poem is short"
6046,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"and reticent. Once or twice in reading it a man may feel, and may"
6047,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"know himself to be none the unmanlier for feeling, as though the very"
6048,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"heart in him cried out for agony of pity, and hardly the flesh could"
6049,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"endure the burden and the strain of it, the burning bitterness of so"
6050,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"keen and divine a draught. A woman might weep it away and be ""all"
6051,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"right"" again--but a man born of woman can hardly be expected to bear"
6052,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,the pity of it.
6053,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6054,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"There is more to the same effect; indeed two whole pages, in the course of"
6055,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"which we are assured that ""never assuredly has any poor penman of the"
6056,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,humblest order been more inwardly conscious of such impotence in words to
6057,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,sustain the weight of their intention than am I at this moment of my
6058,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"inability to cast into any shape of articulate speech, the impression and"
6059,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"the emotion produced by the first reading of Tennyson's _Rizpah_""; that"
6060,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"""the poet never lived on earth whose glory would not be heightened by the"
6061,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"attribution of this poem to his hand""; that any one who hesitated to"
6062,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"affirm as much must be ""either cancerous with malevolence or paralytic"
6063,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"with stupidity""; that now at least ""there must be an end for ever on all"
6064,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,hands to the once debatable question whether the author can properly be
6065,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"called in the strictest sense a great poet""; and, finally, that ""there"
6066,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"must be an end for ever, and a day beyond at least, of a question which"
6067,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"once was even more hotly debatable than this, the long-contested question"
6068,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"of poetic precedence between Alfred Tennyson and Alfred de Musset."""
6069,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6070,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"To all who, like myself, admire _Rizpah_ vastly, and who never doubted"
6071,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"that Mr. Tennyson was a larger poet than Alfred de Musset, the above is,"
6072,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"in a sense, consolatory. But I confess that, even when first perusing it,"
6073,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"and not having yet reached what follows, the note of panegyric struck me"
6074,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"as strained, not to say forced, and I had an uncomfortable sort of feeling"
6075,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,that somebody would have to pay the expense of this prodigal eulogium. To
6076,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,borrow a line Mr. Swinburne himself quotes:
6077,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6078,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,Cette promotion me laisse un peu rêveur.
6079,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6080,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Even when Mr. Swinburne praises, and no one praises more liberally, I do"
6081,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"not know how it strikes other people, but he always gives me the idea that"
6082,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,he is directing his panegyric _at_ somebody who is not being panegyrised;
6083,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"in other words, that he is, to say the least, as much bent upon scarifying"
6084,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"some one who is not mentioned, as on complimenting the person who is. Even"
6085,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"in the passage just reproduced, with the chant over the glories of Mr."
6086,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Tennyson, is mingled a gibe at ""wandering apes"" and ""casual mules."" This,"
6087,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"I say, put me upon my guard. ""Is it conceivable,"" I said to myself, ""that"
6088,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"_Rizpah_, fine, forcible, and effective as it is, should cause all this"
6089,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,difference in a man's estimate of Mr. Tennyson as a poet? Is it possible
6090,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"that any Englishman at least, should have had to wait till this time of"
6091,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,day to discover that 'any comparison of claims between the two men must be
6092,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"unprofitable in itself, as well as unfair to the memory of the lesser"
6093,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"poet'?"" Finally, and to speak my whole mind with perfect candour, it"
6094,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"struck me that, splendid of its kind as _Rizpah_ undoubtedly is, there is"
6095,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"surely some exaggeration in saying, ""If this be not great work, no great"
6096,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"work was ever, or will ever be done in verse by any human hand""; and that"
6097,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Mr. Tennyson himself has not unfrequently done work fully as good as it,"
6098,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"and, _me judice_, even better."
6099,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6100,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,One had not to read much farther to discern that these misgivings were
6101,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,well founded. Somebody indeed had to pay for all the lavish praise of
6102,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"_Rizpah_, and it was the author of _Rizpah_ himself. I felt sure I should"
6103,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"come to the other side of the shield, the obverse hollows of all this"
6104,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"embossed, and, if I may be permitted to say so, somewhat turgid"
6105,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,appreciation; and come to it I did.
6106,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6107,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,There are whole poems of Mr. Tennyson's first period which are no
6108,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,more properly to be called metrical than the more shapeless and
6109,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"monstrous parts of Walt Whitman, which are lineally derived as to"
6110,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,their form--if form that can be called where form is none--from the
6111,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"vilest example set by Cowley, when English verse was first infected"
6112,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"and convulsed by the detestable duncery of sham Pindarics. At times,"
6113,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"of course, his song was then as sweet as ever it has sounded since;"
6114,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,but he never could make sure of singing right for more than a few
6115,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,minutes or stanzas. The strenuous drill through which since then he
6116,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"has felt it necessary to put himself, has done all that hard labour"
6117,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,can do to rectify this congenital complaint: by dint of stocks and
6118,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,backboard he has taught himself a more graceful carriage.... It may
6119,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,be the highest imaginable sign of poetic power or native inspiration
6120,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,that a man should be able to grind a beauty out of a deformity or
6121,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,carve a defect into a perfection; but whatever may be the comparative
6122,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"worth of this peculiar faculty, no poet surely ever had it in a"
6123,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,higher degree or cultivated it with more patient and strenuous
6124,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"industry than Mr. Tennyson. Idler men, or men less qualified, and"
6125,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,disposed to expend such length of time and energy of patience on the
6126,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"composition and modification, the rearrangement and recision and"
6127,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"re-issue, of a single verse or copy of verses, can only look on at"
6128,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"such a course of labour with amused or admiring astonishment, and a"
6129,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"certain doubt whether the linnets, to whose method of singing Mr."
6130,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Tennyson compares his own, do really go through the training of such"
6131,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,a musical gymnasium before they come forth qualified to sing.
6132,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6133,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Everybody has heard of the operation described by Pope as ""damning with"
6134,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"faint praise."" But damning with exaggerated praise is a new invention, and"
6135,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"it is employed in Mr. Swinburne's paper, doubtless unintentionally, but"
6136,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"with striking effect. As we shall see directly, it is not only on what Mr."
6137,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Swinburne calls ""the crowning question of metre,"" that Mr. Tennyson is"
6138,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"assigned a comparatively inferior place, but he is arraigned for his low"
6139,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"estimate of women, for his sympathy with princes, and for various other"
6140,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"crimes and misdemeanours. To say of _Rizpah_, ""never since the beginning"
6141,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,of all poetry were the twin passions of terror and pity more divinely
6142,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"done into deathless words, or set to more perfect and profound"
6143,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"magnificence of music,"" seems a poor set-off to the reproaches just cited,"
6144,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,and still more to those that have yet to be set forth. There is no fear
6145,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"that any one--and Mr. Tennyson himself, I should think, least of all--will"
6146,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,place _Rizpah_ quite in the same category with _Oedipus_ or _Lear_. But
6147,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"there is perhaps some little danger lest the inadvertent should believe,"
6148,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"on Mr. Swinburne's authority, that Mr. Tennyson hits and maintains the"
6149,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,right note only after the same sad drudgery and pain by dint of which we
6150,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,are told--with about equal accuracy--poor Malibran was taught to sing. It
6151,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,is said that women of not very generous temperament will go out of their
6152,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"way to insist that a beautiful slattern dresses admirably, in order to be"
6153,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,in a position plausibly to challenge her beauty. I am sure Mr. Swinburne
6154,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,is not purposely ungenerous; but in first extolling Mr. Tennyson to the
6155,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"skies for his poem of _Rizpah_, and then decrying him almost below the"
6156,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"ground for his defective ear, for his base estimate of women, and for his"
6157,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"adulation of princes, he reminds me of the fable of the eagle who bore the"
6158,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"tortoise aloft into heaven, and then let it fall to earth, in the hope of"
6159,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"smashing its shell, and dining off the contents. If I remember rightly,"
6160,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"the shell did not break after all, and the bird had to flap away as hungry"
6161,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"as ever. In any case, after reading first the extravagant laudation, and"
6162,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"then the yet more extreme obloquy contained in Mr. Swinburne's paper, I"
6163,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"think everybody will agree that, to quote a line with which doubtless he"
6164,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"is familiar, Mr. Tennyson deserved:"
6165,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6166,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,Ni cet excès d'honneur ni cette indignité.
6167,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6168,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"What is the full measure of ""_cette indignité_"" will be seen by and by."
6169,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,But before passing to the other reproaches addressed by Mr. Swinburne to
6170,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"the Laureate, I should like to be allowed to say something about this"
6171,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"question of singing, of ear, of what Mr. Swinburne calls ""the crowning"
6172,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"question of metre."" It is not the first time Mr. Swinburne has assumed"
6173,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,that he possesses infallible authority upon this point. Now he must
6174,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,forgive me for remarking that though musicalness is unquestionably the
6175,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"most noticeable mark, and the most delightful quality, of his own verse,"
6176,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"it is, for the most part, music of a particular kind. It is of the florid"
6177,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"order, rather than of the stately; it is lyrical and Lydian, well"
6178,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"calculated to soothe or to carry along, and sometimes enjoying the Lethean"
6179,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"faculty of making those who read it forget to ask what it means, or indeed"
6180,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,if it means anything very substantial. I will not say that Mr. Swinburne
6181,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"has adopted the principle, ""Take care of the sound, and the sense will"
6182,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"take care of itself."" But he not unfrequently reminds one of this facile"
6183,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"theory, and some of his imitators have adopted it without reserve. I"
6184,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"cannot say whether the story is accurate; but I remember being told that,"
6185,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"on hearing a poem of Mr. Swinburne's read aloud, Mr. Tennyson quietly"
6186,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,quoted a line of his own from _The Lotos-Eaters_:
6187,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6188,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Like a tale of little meaning, though the words are strong."
6189,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6190,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,I should be as unfair to Mr. Swinburne as Mr. Swinburne is to Mr.
6191,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Tennyson, if I hinted that he has not done much work to which the above"
6192,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"verse is altogether inapplicable. But he is at once the poet, the prophet,"
6193,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"and the critic of what I may call, _par excellence_, the Lyrical School;"
6194,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"and his idea of singing, his standard of ear, his touchstone of ""the"
6195,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"crowning question of metre,"" is associated with the great triumphs of"
6196,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,lyricism pure and simple.
6197,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6198,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Now I trust I am not insensible to the exquisite melody, the delicious"
6199,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"dactyls of Shelley, of De Musset, and, I will add, of Mr. Swinburne"
6200,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"himself. But the Lyricists pure and simple--and certainly, as far as verse"
6201,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"is concerned, De Musset never became anything else--are, after all, the"
6202,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"_flentes in limine primo_. They are children, or at most they are boys."
6203,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Every poet, no doubt, should pass through that preliminary stage; but he"
6204,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,should not stay there. There should come a time when the puerile voice
6205,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"changes, and henceforward is recognised as masculine. It should acquire a"
6206,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"passionate composure, and like the spirit that informs it, should be, not"
6207,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"only spacious as the air, not only soaring and circumambient as the sky,"
6208,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"but deep and sonorous as the sea. De Musset, as Mr. Swinburne half allows,"
6209,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"never underwent this solemn transformation; and it is perhaps, on that"
6210,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"very account, that all of us find him, within limits, so irresistibly"
6211,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,attractive. He is the poet of the transitional period between boyhood and
6212,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,manhood.
6213,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6214,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Mes premiers vers sont d'un enfant,"
6215,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Les seconds, d'un adolescent."
6216,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6217,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"He never got beyond the sweet sick springtime of the soul, when it"
6218,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"searches for what it is never to find, when it strains towards what it"
6219,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"never can clutch, when the ""flowers appear on the earth, the time of the"
6220,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"singing of the birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our"
6221,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"land; the fig-tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the"
6222,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"tender grape give a good smell,"" and the whole want and utterance of the"
6223,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"heart is embodied in the cry, ""Arise, my love, my fair one, and come"
6224,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"away!"" He who has not ""_passé par là_"" will never be much of a poet; but"
6225,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"he who does not pass beyond it, will never be a great one. Yet this"
6226,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"season of the ""Song of Songs"" is the eternal quest of the young, the"
6227,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"eternal regret of the old. Nothing can superannuate its charm, nothing can"
6228,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"quench its fascination. At the climax of his strength and his fame, Byron"
6229,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"could not help exclaiming, ""The days of our youth are the days of our"
6230,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"glory,"" and M. Taine was doubtless under the spell of this periodically"
6231,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"recurring sentiment, this irresistible return, ever and anon, to one's"
6232,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"first love, when, for a brief moment, flinging sober criticism and just"
6233,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"judgment to the winds, he asked if it is not pardonable to prefer the"
6234,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,author of _Les Nuits_ to the author of the _Idylls_.
6235,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6236,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Just one word more about ""singing."" Speaking of the earlier poems of De"
6237,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Musset, Mr. Swinburne observes: ""Of all thin and shallow criticisms, none"
6238,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,ever was shallower or thinner than that which would describe these
6239,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"firstlings of Musset's genius as mere Byronic echoes."" True enough. But,"
6240,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"he goes on to say, ""in that case they would be tuneless as their original,"
6241,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"whereas they are the notes of a singer who cannot but sing."""
6242,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6243,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,This is not the first time we have been treated to this opinion. Once
6244,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,before Mr. Swinburne has spoken of Byron as a singer who could not sing. I
6245,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"ventured to reply, at the time, that he was a singer who could not or"
6246,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,would not shriek. It is necessary to repeat the protest. No doubt Byron
6247,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"shows, as a rule, rather volume of voice than flexibility; and from a"
6248,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"determination not to resemble excellent models, but to strike out a line"
6249,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"for himself--a passion for pseudo-originality, from which lesser poets"
6250,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"that could be named, since his time, have likewise suffered--his blank"
6251,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,verse is generally detestable. But Shelley did not find out that Byron
6252,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"could not sing; neither did Scott, nor Goethe, nor Lamartine, nor"
6253,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Pushkin, nor Leopardi, nor De Musset himself. He speaks of the ""chant"" of"
6254,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Byron as that of ""_un cygne_,"" and compares the echo of his song to ""_le"
6255,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"torrent dans la verte vallée_."" Mr. Swinburne's discovery is strictly his"
6256,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"own, and I should advise him not to press it. Indeed it would not be"
6257,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,difficult to dispose of it by the method of reasoning familiarly known as
6258,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,a _reductio ad absurdum_. Mr. Swinburne affirms that the question of metre
6259,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"is the crowning question, in other words, that the greatest poets are the"
6260,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"most musical, and most people would be disposed to agree with the dictum,"
6261,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,if the question what music is were first satisfactorily settled. But Mr.
6262,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Swinburne will have it that Byron cannot sing, whereas it is quite certain"
6263,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,that Mr. Swinburne can. Therefore Mr. Swinburne is a greater poet than
6264,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Byron: which, everybody will allow, is absurd. Q.E.D."
6265,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6266,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,I daresay larks do not find much music in the thunder. But they have the
6267,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,sense to be silent when they hear the roll of that untrembling diapason
6268,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,that makes all things tremble.
6269,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6270,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"To speak the plain truth, we are threatened, just at present, with too"
6271,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"much of what Mr. Swinburne means by ""singing."" Does he not remember the"
6272,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,following passage in the Fourth Book of _Paradise Regained_?--
6273,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6274,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,There shalt thou hear and learn the secret power
6275,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Of harmony, in tones and numbers hit"
6276,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"By voice or hand, and various-measured verse,"
6277,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Æolian charms and Dorian lyric odes,"
6278,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"And his who gave them birth, _but higher sung_,"
6279,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Blind Melesigenes, thence Homer called."
6280,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6281,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Milton goes on to speak of ""the lofty grave tragedians"" who employed"
6282,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"""chorus or iambic,"""
6283,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6284,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,High actions and high passions best describing.
6285,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6286,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,Sheer lyricism just now is overmuch the mode. It is all very nice and
6287,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"pleasant in its way, and within bounds, but one can have too much of a"
6288,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"good thing, and one does not want poetry to become _vox et præterea"
6289,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"nihil_. It is a fashion, doubtless, that will pass. If it does not, I fear"
6290,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"people will begin to say of poetry what some one said of operatic music,"
6291,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"_Ce qui ne vaut pas la peine d'être dit on le chante_, and we shall"
6292,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,require a Wagner in literature to denounce the meaningless _fioriture_ of
6293,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,musical bards bent on recalling the most irrelevant flourishes of
6294,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Donizetti. Mr. Tennyson never does, and has never done, that."
6295,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6296,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,The assertion that Mr. Tennyson was born with an inaptitude for musical
6297,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"verse, though I conceive it to be very wide of the mark, I can at least"
6298,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,understand. It is made intelligible by remembering the limits Mr.
6299,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Swinburne assigns to music, and the characteristic preference he exhibits,"
6300,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"in his own writings, for certain forms of it. But when we are told that"
6301,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"""among all poems of serious pretensions in that line ... this latest epic"
6302,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"of King Arthur took the very lowest view of virtue, set up the very"
6303,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"poorest and most pitiful standard of duty, or of heroism for woman or for"
6304,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"man,"" I own I feel as much perplexity as surprise. Perhaps the solution of"
6305,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,the riddle might be got at by again resorting to the process just
6306,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"employed, and by inquiring what is Mr. Swinburne's own standard of duty or"
6307,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"heroism for woman or for man, and informing ourselves through a diligent"
6308,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"reperusal of his poems, and of those writers whose productions he has the"
6309,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"loudest extolled, what it is he and they consider men and women ought"
6310,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"mainly to feel, and what it is they ought mainly to occupy themselves"
6311,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"with. But such a course might be invidious. Happily, moreover, it is"
6312,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,unnecessary. It is enough to bring Mr. Tennyson's men and women into
6313,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"court, to let men and women be the jury, and to read over to them the"
6314,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,following indictment:
6315,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6316,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,I cannot say that Mr. Tennyson's life-long tone about women and their
6317,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,shortcomings has ever commended itself to my poor mind as the note of
6318,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"a very pure or high one. There is always a latent, if not a patent"
6319,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"propensity in many of his very lovers, to scold and whine after a"
6320,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,fashion which makes even Alfred de Musset seem by comparison a model
6321,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,or a type of manliness. His Enids and Edith Aylmers are much below
6322,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"the ideal mark of Wordsworth, who has never, I believe, been"
6323,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"considered a specially great master in that kind; but his ""little"
6324,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Letties"" were apparently made mean and thin of nature to match their"
6325,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,pitifully poor-spirited suitors! It cannot respectfully be supposed
6326,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,that Mr. Tennyson is unaware of the paltry currishness and
6327,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,mean-spirited malice displayed in verse too dainty for such base uses
6328,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,by the plaintively spiteful manikins with the thinnest whey of sour
6329,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"milk in their poor fretful veins, whom he brings forward to vent upon"
6330,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,some fickle or too discerning mistress the vain and languid venom of
6331,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,their contemptible contempt.
6332,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6333,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,What does it mean? Several years ago I ventured to express the opinion
6334,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"that Mr. Tennyson's was rather a feminine than a masculine Muse,"
6335,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"borrowing, naturally enough, its idiosyncrasy from the period when it was"
6336,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,most susceptible to surrounding influences. One or two persons of far
6337,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"higher critical authority than I can pretend to, told me I had struck a"
6338,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"true note, and to the opinion then advanced, I am still disposed in"
6339,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,substance to adhere. But I seize this opportunity to say that I have long
6340,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"perceived that the opinion was advanced with exaggeration, and somewhat"
6341,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,unbecomingly; that the essay in which it appeared has for a considerable
6342,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"time been out of print, and will never with the author's consent be"
6343,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,republished; and finally that it would never have appeared at all but for
6344,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"a circumstance which it would be disagreeable, because egotistical, to"
6345,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"explain explicitly, but which perhaps many will at once understand, if I"
6346,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,quote the following lines of De Musset to Sainte-Beuve:
6347,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6348,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Ami, tu l'as bien dit: ..."
6349,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6350,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,*       *       *       *       *
6351,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6352,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"""Il existe, en un mot, chez les trois quarts des hommes,"
6353,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Un poëte mort jeune à qui l'homme survit,"""
6354,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Tu l'as bien dit, ami, mais tu l'as trop bien dit."
6355,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Tu ne prenais pas garde, en traçant ta pensée"
6356,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6357,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,*       *       *       *       *
6358,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6359,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,que tu blasphémais ...
6360,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"... Je te rends à ta Muse offensée,"
6361,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,Et souviens-toi qu'en nous il existe souvent
6362,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,Un poète endormi toujours jeune et vivant.
6363,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6364,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,But it is precisely because there is so much of the feminine quality in
6365,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Mr. Tennyson's Muse, that his Muse is beloved of women, and is attractive"
6366,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,to all men to whom women are attractive. How often has it happened to one
6367,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"to ask ""What shall I read?"" and to get for answer ""Tennyson."" And though"
6368,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"one might be almost angry because neither Shakespeare, nor Milton, nor"
6369,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Byron, nor Wordsworth, could get a hearing, so it was, and _femme le veut"
6370,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,Dieu le veut_. He is the poet of their predilection; and if it were true
6371,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"that his women are not ""very pure or high,"" it would seem to follow that"
6372,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"the women in flesh and blood who love to read of them, are themselves not"
6373,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,very high or pure. Is not that another _reductio ad absurdum_? I confess I
6374,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"never knew them ask any one to read _Vivien_. They prefer _Elaine_, and"
6375,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"_Guinevere_. Yet _Vivien_ is a masterpiece, and that ""harlot,"" as Mr."
6376,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Tennyson very properly does not shrink from calling her, is the consummate"
6377,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,poetic type of women with very little poetry about them. But the
6378,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"blameless love of Elaine, and the pardonable passion of Guinevere, are, to"
6379,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"say the least of it, equally emblematic; and I confess I should find"
6380,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"myself so different in blood, in language, in race, in instinct, in"
6381,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"everything, from the man who told me that he found the one mean and low,"
6382,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"or the other poor, pitiful and base, that, as I have declared, I should"
6383,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,not understand him.
6384,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6385,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"On two points, I imagine, most men, on consideration, would agree with Mr."
6386,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Swinburne. _The Idylls of the King_, _are_ Idylls of the King, and not an"
6387,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"epic poem, nor indeed _one_ poem of any kind. I am not aware that Mr."
6388,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,Tennyson has ever said or suggested the contrary; and no man is
6389,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,responsible for the extravagances of his less discreet or too generous
6390,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,admirers. I suspect Mr. Tennyson would consider the terms Mr. Swinburne
6391,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,himself applies to _Rizpah_ as a trifle uncritical. The other point of
6392,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"agreement they would have with Mr. Swinburne is that King Arthur, in the"
6393,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"_Idylls_, is not an adequate and satisfactory hero. But heroes from time"
6394,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,immemorial have had a knack of breaking in the hands of their creator. The
6395,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"""pius Æneas"" is not worthy of his vicissitudes, his mission, and his fate,"
6396,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,or of the splendid verse in which his name is forever embalmed. Milton
6397,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,assuredly did not intend to make Lucifer his hero; but the ruined
6398,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,Archangel dwarfs into insignificance all other personages in _Paradise
6399,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Lost_, human, divine, or infernal. From _Childe Harold_, Childe Harold all"
6400,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,but disappears; and I suspect it is only by aid of the drama that a writer
6401,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"is able to say successfully, ""Behold a man!"""
6402,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6403,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"I think Mr. Swinburne will perceive that, though my lights may be less"
6404,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"than his, I am sincerely anxious to get at the truth, and that my object"
6405,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"is neither to provoke nor to propitiate, neither to extol nor to decry."
6406,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"But what can I or any one say, in sufficient moderation, respecting the"
6407,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,following passage?--
6408,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6409,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"""But,"" says the Laureate, ""it is not Malory's King Arthur, nor yet"
6410,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Geoffrey's King Arthur, that I have desired to reproduce: on the"
6411,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"contrary, it is 'scarcely other than' Prince Albert"" ... who, if"
6412,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"neither a wholly gigantic nor altogether a divine personage, was, at"
6413,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"least, one would imagine, a human figure.... This fact, it would"
6414,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"seem, was revealed to Mr. Tennyson himself, of all men on earth, by"
6415,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,some freak of the same humorous or malicious fairy who disclosed to
6416,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"him the not less amusing truth, and induced him to publish it, with a"
6417,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"face of unmoved gravity, to the nation and the world, that whenever"
6418,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,he said King Arthur he meant Prince Albert. No satirist could have
6419,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,ventured on either stroke of sarcasm.... Not as yet had the blameless
6420,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Albert, at the bidding of his Merlin Palmerston, led forth--we will"
6421,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,not say his Guinevere--to clasp the thievish hand of a then uncrowned
6422,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,assassin.
6423,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6424,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"I said, a little while back, that I would not accuse Mr. Swinburne of"
6425,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,intentional want of generosity. Yet I am compelled to aver that a more
6426,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,ungenerous passage than the above I never read; and it would seem still
6427,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,more ungenerous were it to be quoted from more freely. Mr. Swinburne has
6428,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,not the excuse that might be pleaded by a critic who was stupid. He is a
6429,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"poet, and he knows what fine, delicate, subtle analogies are as well as"
6430,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,any one. There _is_ a striking resemblance between the nobler qualities of
6431,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Mr. Tennyson's ""ideal knight"" and those of the late Prince Consort, and it"
6432,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,was a true and fresh stroke of poetry to associate them as Mr. Tennyson
6433,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"has done. But is it true, or fair, or ""manly,"" to assert that the poet"
6434,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"wished the one to be entirely identified with the other, much more that"
6435,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,when he mentions the one he means the other? I fear some people will
6436,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,conclude that the above unmagnanimous passage was dictated by Mr.
6437,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Swinburne's hatred of princes; and less indulgent persons will add, by"
6438,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,his want of love for Mr. Tennyson.
6439,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6440,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Now, to my thinking, the most loathsome of all characters is a sycophant."
6441,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,Perhaps I am more comprehensive in my contempt for that tribe even than
6442,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,Mr. Swinburne himself; for I hold in equal disdain the flatterers of
6443,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"princes and the flatterers of the people. The folly, the feebleness, and"
6444,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"the fury of kings is to be matched only by the feebleness, the folly, and"
6445,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"the fury of crowds. Sensible men entertain a careful distrust of each, and"
6446,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,devise and maintain every possible barrier against the selfish vagaries of
6447,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,both alike. It is the rare distinction of Prince Albert that he imposed
6448,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,upon himself those checks which most men require to have imposed upon them
6449,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"by others, and against which, whether proceeding from within or from"
6450,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"without, princes usually rebel. When we are shown a _demos_ as wise, as"
6451,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"patriotic, as conscientious, and as capable of self-abnegation, as Prince"
6452,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Albert, the time will have come for an honest man to chant its virtues,"
6453,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,and we shall be able to look forward to the future of our race with more
6454,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,hopeful feelings than are at present possible to a sane philanthropy.
6455,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6456,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Sycophants, therefore, can dance attendance on the Many as easily and as"
6457,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,mischievously as on the One; and of all the unmeasured adulators of the
6458,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,multitude I know no one to compare with the poet before whom Mr. Swinburne
6459,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"is perpetually prostrating himself, and before whom he bows and bobs and"
6460,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,genuflects an almost countless number of times in the course of the paper
6461,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"on which I am commenting--to wit, M. Victor Hugo."
6462,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6463,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"I have no wish to assail any man of letters, be his foibles what they may."
6464,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,But when Mr. Swinburne girds at both De Musset and Mr. Tennyson for having
6465,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"written civilly of princes, and observes that ""poeticules love"
6466,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"princelings as naturally as poets abhor tyrants,"" it is perhaps pertinent"
6467,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,to ask him if he is aware that the first verses of M. Victor Hugo were
6468,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,passionately Royalist; that the refrain of one of his early poems is
6469,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"""_Vive le Roi! Vive la France!_"" that he celebrated the Duc d'Angoulême as"
6470,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"""the greatest of warriors""; that he mourned the death of Louis XVIII. with"
6471,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"loyal pathos; that he wrote a tragedy whose last line was ""_Quand on haït"
6472,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"les tyrans, on doit aimer les rois_""; that the first patron of the author"
6473,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"of _Odes et Poésies Diverses_ was a king, who gave M. Victor Hugo a"
6474,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"pension of a thousand francs out of his privy purse, which was afterwards"
6475,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"doubled, and which I believe was not resigned till the year 1832, or when"
6476,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,M. Victor Hugo was thirty years of age; and that though he for a time
6477,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"seemed disposed to declare himself a Republican, he sought for and"
6478,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,obtained a seat in the House of Peers from Louis Philippe as recently as
6479,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,1845. Far be it from me to attempt to turn these facts against the
6480,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,reputation of M. Victor Hugo. I entertain no doubt they are capable of a
6481,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,perfectly satisfactory explanation. But let us not have two weights and
6482,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,two measures; and before Mr. Swinburne takes to throwing stones against
6483,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"those who incur his displeasure, let him look carefully round to see if"
6484,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,some of those who excite his admiration are not living in a house with a
6485,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,good many glass windows.
6486,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6487,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,Against M. Victor Hugo as a man I have necessarily no word to utter. But
6488,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,Mr. Swinburne compels one to say something about him as a poet. In this
6489,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"paper upon Mr. Tennyson and De Musset alone, we come upon the following"
6490,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"phrases, all of them applied to M. Victor Hugo: ""The mightiest master of"
6491,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"the nineteenth century""; ""One far greater than Byron or Lamartine""; ""The"
6492,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"greatest living poet""; ""The godlike hand of Victor Hugo""; ""Only Victor"
6493,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Hugo himself can make words thunder and lighten like these."" There is"
6494,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"more, I think, of the same kind; but it perhaps suffices to mention these,"
6495,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,for previous experience has made us familiar with the assumption that
6496,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,underlies them.
6497,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6498,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,It would be as presumptuous in me to make the world a present of my
6499,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"opinion as to who is the greatest of modern poets, as I conceive it is in"
6500,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,Mr. Swinburne to be perpetually pursuing that course. I will therefore
6501,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,content myself with saying that to attribute that distinction to M. Hugo
6502,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"seems to me simply ludicrous, unless clatter be the same thing as fame,"
6503,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,and confident copiousness is to be accepted as a conclusive credential of
6504,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"superiority; that in the opinion of Sainte-Beuve, De Musset was far more"
6505,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"of a poet than M. Victor Hugo; and that, with the exception of Mr."
6506,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Swinburne himself, all English critics, with whom I am acquainted,"
6507,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,entertain no sort of doubt that Mr. Tennyson is a more considerable poet
6508,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,than both De Musset and M. Victor Hugo put together with a large margin to
6509,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"spare. In any case, does Mr. Swinburne think that, by ""damnable iteration"""
6510,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"about the ""great master,"" he will alter the fact, or convert any human"
6511,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,being to a creed in the propagation of which he seems unaccountably
6512,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"zealous? If he does, I recommend to his perusal the following brief"
6513,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"observation of Sainte-Beuve, which he will find in a ""Causerie"" upon"
6514,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,George Sand:
6515,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6516,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,Ceux qui cherchent à imposer aux autres une foi qu'ils ne sont pas
6517,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"bien sûrs d'avoir eux-mêmes, s'échauffent en parlant, affirment sur"
6518,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"tous les tons, et se font prophètes afin de tâcher d'être croyants."
6519,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6520,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,I have said that the zeal of Mr. Swinburne in perpetually asseverating the
6521,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"unapproachable superiority of M. Victor Hugo is unaccountable. Perhaps,"
6522,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"however, it is to be accounted for by reading between the lines of the"
6523,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,following passage:
6524,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6525,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"""As lyric poet and as republican leader, the master poet of the world"
6526,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"has equally deserved to attain this obloquy, to incur this tribute"
6527,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"from a journal""--the reference, I believe, is to the _Figaro_ of"
6528,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Paris--""to which the principles of republican faith, a writer to whom"
6529,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,the pretensions of lyric poetry are naturally and equally abhorrent
6530,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,and contemptible: nor could any law of nature or any result of chance
6531,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,be more equitably satisfactory than one which should gratify the
6532,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,wish--or the three wishes--that all who do not love the one should
6533,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,hate the other: that all such men should be even as M. Zola: and that
6534,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"all such writers as M. Zola, should be haters and scorners alike of"
6535,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"republican principles and of lyric song."""
6536,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,
6537,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"With every desire not to be intolerant, and to inform oneself of what is"
6538,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"going on in this world, I think one may be pardoned for being unable to"
6539,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"read M. Zola. I should as soon think of doing things I will not even name,"
6540,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"as of reading _L'Assommoir_; and I fancy most Englishmen, whether"
6541,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Monarchists or Republicans, whether lyrists or the most prosaic folk in"
6542,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"the world, entertain the same repugnance. But what, in the name of all"
6543,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"that is fair, and manly, and magnanimous, have political opinions got to"
6544,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"do with literary merit? Politics and literature are distinct, and though,"
6545,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"as abundant experience has shown, one and the same man may make his mark"
6546,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"in both, they are separate spheres of the same brain, and a man may be a"
6547,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"good poet and a bad politician, or a bad poet and a good politician, or"
6548,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,either good or bad in each capacity alike. Once you care one straw what
6549,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"are the political opinions of a poet, there is an end of you as a critic."
6550,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"Royalist, Republican, Communist, Deist, Pantheist,--what care I which of"
6551,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"these a poet is, so he is a poet? As a fact, I fancy the greater sort of"
6552,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"poets usually wear their creeds rather loosely; and if we find a poet, in"
6553,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"his character of poet, a perpetually passionate advocate, misgivings as to"
6554,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,his permanent fame may reasonably be entertained. Still no absolute rule
6555,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,can be applied to these irregular planets. One likes a poet to love his
6556,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"country, on the same principle which Cicero says made Ulysses love Ithaca,"
6557,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"""not because it was broad, but because it was his own."" Mr. Tennyson loves"
6558,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"his country warmly, and for this Mr. Swinburne rebukes him with indulging"
6559,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"in the ""beardless bluster of the Tory member, not of a provincial deputy,"
6560,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,"but of a provincial schoolboy."" This is perhaps the most inapt of all the"
6561,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,inapt observations in his amazing piece of criticism.
6562,A VINDICATION OF TENNYSON,

6587,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"It occasionally happens to men of letters, at political gatherings, to be"
6588,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,asked to respond to the toast of Literature; so one may fairly conclude
6589,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"that, in the opinion of many persons, there is between literature and"
6590,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,politics a close and familiar relation. I have long believed that there
6591,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,is; and observation of the opinions of others has led me to inquire
6592,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,whether the relation be one of amity or of antagonism. I propose to
6593,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"endeavour, even though it be by reflections that may appear deliberative"
6594,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"rather than dogmatic, to elucidate a question that is not devoid of"
6595,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,interest.
6596,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,
6597,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Mr. Trevelyan has recorded a saying of Macaulay to this effect, that a man"
6598,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"who, endowed with equal capacity for achieving distinction in literature"
6599,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"and in politics, selects a political career, gives proof of insanity. Most"
6600,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"men of letters, I fancy, would endorse that sentiment. But the decisions"
6601,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"which men have to make in this world are not, as a rule, presented to them"
6602,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"with the definiteness that gives artistic charm, as well as moral meaning,"
6603,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,to a well-known masterpiece in the Palazzo Borghese. Between Sacred and
6604,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Profane Love, between the love of literature and the pursuit of politics,"
6605,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"the line is not, in practice, drawn so hard and fast as in the beautiful"
6606,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,apologue immortalised by Titian. Loves that are altogether sacred and in
6607,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"no degree profane, are not, I imagine, frequently offered to any one; and"
6608,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"though loves wholly profane and in no measure sacred, are, perhaps, not so"
6609,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"uncommon, they are not likely in that absolutely coarse form to exercise"
6610,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,enduring attraction over the finer spirits. It is the curious and
6611,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,inextricable amalgam of the two that constitutes the embarrassment.
6612,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,Literature entirely divorced from politics is a thing by no means so
6613,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"easily attained, or so disinterestedly sought after, as it is sometimes"
6614,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"assumed to be; and though, with much Parliamentary and extra-Parliamentary"
6615,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"oratory before our minds, we should hesitate to affirm that politics are"
6616,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"not occasionally cultivated with a fine disregard for literature, yet the"
6617,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,literary flavour that is still present in the speeches of some Party
6618,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Politicians, suffices to show that literature and politics are in practice"
6619,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,not so much distinct territories as border-lands whose boundaries are not
6620,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"easily defined, but that continually run into, overlap, and are frequently"
6621,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"confounded with, each other."
6622,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,
6623,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"But is it to be desired, even should it appear to be possible, to restrict"
6624,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"literature and politics each to its own particular sphere, and forbid"
6625,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,either to trespass upon the territory of the other? Would they be gainers
6626,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,by this absolute severance? I am disposed to think that both would be
6627,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"losers; and the loss, I fancy, would fall more heavily upon literature"
6628,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,even than upon politics. Dickens is said to have expressed his regret
6629,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"that, as he worded it, a man like Disraeli should have thrown himself away"
6630,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"by becoming a politician. The observation, perhaps, smacks a little of the"
6631,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,too narrow estimate of life with which that man of genius may not unjustly
6632,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"be reproached. But few people, if any, would think of denying that Lord"
6633,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,Beaconsfield might have won more enduring distinction in the Republic of
6634,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Letters than can be accurately placed to his account, had he dedicated"
6635,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"himself with less ardour--or, perhaps it would be more correct to say,"
6636,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,with less tenacity--to party politics. Like most persons of a
6637,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"contemplative disposition, he read sparingly, and found in the pages of"
6638,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"others not so much what they themselves put there, as a provocation and"
6639,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"stimulus to fresh thoughts of his own. ""See what my gracious Sovereign"
6640,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"sent me as a present at Christmas,"" he said to me one day. It was a copy"
6641,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"of the edition de luxe of _Romola_; and in it was written, in the"
6642,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"beautiful flowing hand of the Queen, ""To the Earl of Beaconsfield, K.G.,"
6643,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"from his affectionate and grateful friend, Victoria."" ""But,"" he added, ""I"
6644,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"cannot read it."" I ventured to recommend him not to make that confession"
6645,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"to everybody, for it would not raise their estimate of his literary"
6646,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"acumen. ""Well,"" he said, ""it's no use. I can't."" No doubt _Romola_ not"
6647,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"unoften smells overmuch of the lamp, and in all probability will not"
6648,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,permanently occupy the position assigned to it with characteristic
6649,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"over-confidence by contemporaneous enthusiasm. But, if a man can read"
6650,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"novels at all, and if he demands from the novelist something more than the"
6651,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"mere craft of the story-teller, surely _Romola_ ought to give him"
6652,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"pleasure; and I suspect it would have pleased him, had he permitted his"
6653,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,taste as a man of letters the same amount of expansion he afforded to his
6654,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"tendencies as a practical politician. At the same time, I could well"
6655,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"understand a person arguing, though I could hardly agree with him, that he"
6656,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,was not designed by nature to be a more complete and finished man of
6657,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"letters than he actually became, and that his keen interest in politics,"
6658,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"and the knowledge of political and social life he in consequence acquired,"
6659,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,contribute to his written works their principal charm and their most
6660,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"valuable ingredients. I suspect the truth to be, that he was compounded in"
6661,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"such equal proportions of the man of meditation and the man of action,"
6662,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,that under no circumstances would he have been content to be merely a man
6663,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"of letters, or merely a politician, and that he fulfilled his nature by"
6664,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,being alternately one and the other. That a man should attain to supreme
6665,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"eminence in literature by pursuing such a course, is out of the question."
6666,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"The wonder is that, having achieved even such literary distinction as he"
6667,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"did, he should have attained to such supreme eminence as a statesman."
6668,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,
6669,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"If, therefore, Lord Beaconsfield might have been a more distinguished man"
6670,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"of letters, had he not been so keen a politician, the proper conclusion"
6671,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"would seem to be that literature in his case suffered hurt, not from"
6672,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"politics, but from an excess of politics. It would not be easy to name a"
6673,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,character more utterly unlike his than Wordsworth--a man of letters pure
6674,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"and simple, if we are ever to find one. True it is that Wordsworth in"
6675,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"extreme youth wrote some political verse, that he loved his country with"
6676,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"ardour, and that the word England had for him great and stimulating"
6677,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"associations; but, as a rule, he lived remote from human ken, divorced"
6678,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"from human business, amid the silence of the starry sky and the sleep of"
6679,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,the everlasting hills. What was the result? I admire the best and highest
6680,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,poetry of Wordsworth with a fervour and an enthusiasm not exceeded by
6681,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"those who will, perhaps, forgive me for calling them his more fanatical"
6682,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,worshippers. But I must continue to think that Wordsworth would have given
6683,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"himself the chance of being a yet greater poet than he was, had he--I do"
6684,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"not say quitted his lakes, and hills, and streams; heaven forbid!--but had"
6685,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"he consorted at times more freely and fully with his fellow-men, had he"
6686,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"been not a poet only, but something in addition to a poet; had he led a"
6687,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"rather more mixed life; had he done, in fact, what we know was done by the"
6688,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"great Athenian dramatists, by Virgil, by Dante, by Chaucer, Spenser,"
6689,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Shakespeare, Milton, Byron, and even by Shelley. Politics do not"
6690,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"necessarily mean party politics, though in this country, at this moment,"
6691,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"the one runs dangerously near to implying the other. Politics mean, or"
6692,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"ought to mean, the practical concerns of the many, of the state, of the"
6693,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Empire, or of mankind at large, as contradistinguished from the mere"
6694,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,personal or class interests. But with those wider concerns Wordsworth
6695,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"would have little or nothing to do, except in the most abstract way; and"
6696,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"the consequence is that his poetry is the poetry of the individual, and"
6697,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"nearly always of the same individual, and is lacking in the element of"
6698,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"variety, especially in the greatest element of all, viz. action, in which"
6699,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,is necessarily included the portrayal of passion and character.
6700,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,
6701,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Would not the proper conclusion, therefore--a conclusion not overstrained"
6702,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"and if not stated with excessive dogmatism--seem to be, that literature,"
6703,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"though demanding precedence in the affections, and exacting the chief"
6704,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"attention of one who professes really to love it, is not a jealous"
6705,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"mistress, but, on the contrary, is only too well pleased to see even its"
6706,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,most attached votaries combine with their one supreme passion a number of
6707,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,minor interests and even minor affections. A very sagacious person has
6708,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"said, ""Action may not bring happiness; but there is no happiness without"
6709,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"action."" I am not sure that that is quite true, for Epictetus, and even"
6710,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Epicurus, would have something to say on the other side. But I entertain"
6711,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,little doubt that it is strictly true to affirm that the highest literary
6712,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"eminence is not attainable by persons who stand aloof, and have always"
6713,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"stood aloof, from the field of action; that mere contemplation, no matter"
6714,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"how lofty, how profound, or how persistent, will not make a man a supreme"
6715,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"poet or a supreme artist of any kind; and that the doctrine of ""art for"
6716,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"art's sake,"" if applied in a perverse signification, must end by narrowing"
6717,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"and finally debasing what it is intended to elevate. Action helps thought,"
6718,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"and thought helps action. By action thought is rendered more masculine,"
6719,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"attains to greater breadth, and acquires a certain nobleness and dignity."
6720,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Thanks to thought, action may become more definite, more precise, more"
6721,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,fruitful. But that is on the assumption that each exerts itself in due
6722,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"times and seasons, and leaves to the other abundant opportunities and"
6723,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,ample latitude. When we are bidden to observe that
6724,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,
6725,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,the native hue of resolution
6726,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,"
6727,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,
6728,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"we well understand that thought has been excessive, that action has not"
6729,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"had fair play, and that the brain has paralysed the hand."
6730,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,
6731,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"No one can read the _Iliad_ without feeling that the writer, or writers,"
6732,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"of the stirring debates with which it is thronged had consorted with, and"
6733,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"was intimately familiar with public life. Many years ago, addressing an"
6734,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"assembling of Cambridge undergraduates at a political meeting, and seeking"
6735,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"to justify the toast of literature they had given me as a text, I"
6736,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"ventured, with a certain levity congenial to my young but classical"
6737,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"audience, to ask if the _Iliad_ is not a political poem, for is it not"
6738,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"full of discussions as animated as any of our own Parliamentary ones, in"
6739,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"which Agamemnon, Nestor, Ulysses, to say nothing of Thersites,"
6740,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"successively take part; and are not these succeeded, as in our own case,"
6741,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"by deliberations in an Upper House, where Juno, Venus, Vulcan, and even"
6742,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Jove himself, participate in the oratorical debate? The first and last"
6743,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"note of the _Æneid_, indeed the one text of the great poem of Virgil, is"
6744,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"_Romanam condere gentem_, to show how was established, and to intimate how"
6745,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"might be extended, the Empire of Rome. Virgil, the most tender, the most"
6746,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"finished, the most literary of poets, took the warmest interest in the"
6747,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"politics of his country, or he would never have got much beyond the range"
6748,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,of his Pastorals and Bucolics. The first word in the first ode of Horace
6749,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"is the name of an Augustan minister, quickly to be followed by the ode,"
6750,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"_Jam satis terris_, with its patriotic allusions to national pride and"
6751,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"military honour. Most people, I imagine, associate Dante with the period"
6752,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"of his exile, forgetting why he was exiled. He had to thank the interest"
6753,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,he displayed in the politics of his native city for that prolonged
6754,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"banishment; and so keen a politician was this great contemplative bard,"
6755,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"that in the same poem in which Beatrice reproves him in heaven, Dante"
6756,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,represents his political enemies as gnashing their teeth in hell. That was
6757,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"when he had become the man of letters pure and simple. But, in the hey-day"
6758,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"of his fortunes, and long after he had first seen and become enamoured of"
6759,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Beatrice, and had written the _Vita Nuova_, he had taken so active a part"
6760,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"and become so influential a personage in the public affairs of Florence,"
6761,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"that, when invited to go on a difficult embassy, he exclaimed, ""If I go,"
6762,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"who will stay? Yet, if I stay, who will go?"" It was no backsliding,"
6763,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"therefore, no hesitation, that made Dante a public character for a moment,"
6764,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"quickly to repent his infidelity to the Muse. To the last, it is"
6765,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,abundantly evident that he would fain have combined in his career the poet
6766,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"and the politician. Yet the first words addressed by Virgil to Dante, when"
6767,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"they met _nel gran diserto_, and Dante asked him whether he was _ombra od"
6768,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"uomo certo_, seem almost to imply that Virgil meant to reprove the"
6769,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,intruder upon the _selva oscura_ with condescending to mix in the turmoil
6770,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"of public life, instead of confining himself to literature and philosophy."
6771,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"These are the words, which students of the _Divina Commedia_ will scarcely"
6772,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,require to have cited for them:
6773,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,
6774,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Poeta fui, e cantai di quel giusto"
6775,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Figliuol d'Anchise, che venne da Troia,"

6781,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"I was a poet, and I sang of that just son of Anchises, who came from"

6783,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,to worries of that sort! Why do you not ascend the delectable
6784,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"mountain, which is the principle and cause of all true happiness?"
6785,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,
6786,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"We must bear in mind, however, that the words are not the real words of"
6787,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Virgil, but words put into his mouth by Dante at a period when Dante"
6788,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"himself was weary and sick to death of _tanta noia_, the annoyances and"
6789,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"mortifications of political life, and had cast longing eyes upon the"
6790,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,_dilettoso monte_. What real man of letters that ever ventured into the
6791,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,arid and somewhat vulgar domain of Party-politics has not felt the same
6792,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"feeling of revulsion, the same longing for the water-brooks? But, years"
6793,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"after Dante wrote that passage, he strove, petitioned, and conspired to be"
6794,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"allowed to return to Florence and its perpetual civic strife, and envied,"
6795,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"as Byron makes him say, in _The Prophecy of Dante_:"

6814,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Both these poets were, in the phrase of Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"

6816,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,mould of their enduring verse. No one should need to be reminded that
6817,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,Chaucer was the friend of statesmen and the colleague of ambassadors. In
6818,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,him we find the two salient characteristics of all the best English
6819,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"poetry--a close observation and tender love of external nature, and a keen"
6820,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"interest in the characters and doings of men; and, for this reason, he has"
6821,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,often been hailed as the precursor of Shakespeare. The lofty symbolism of
6822,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Spenser, and the unvarying elevation and dignity of his style, seem to"
6823,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"place him rather remote from the common herd, and to make him, in a sense,"
6824,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,a little less human than some might wish him to be. But in his writings he
6825,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,holds himself aloof from the vulgar no more than Dante does; and like
6826,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Dante, he was a man of the world, and participated in the art of"

6835,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,lively interest in the politics of his country. Shakespeare is the idol of
6836,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"us all, the only reproach I have ever heard addressed to him being that he"
6837,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"was rather too aristocratic in his sympathies, and too Conservative in the"
6838,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"non-Party sense, in his views; foibles which perhaps ought not to surprise"
6839,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"us in one who had so intimate a knowledge of human nature, and so shrewd"
6840,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"an appreciation of its strong and weak points. Nor was it an injury, but a"
6841,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"distinct gain, to the prince of dramatic poets, that he should have been"
6842,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"compelled to concern himself with the practical affairs of life, and to"
6843,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,busy himself actively with the management of a theatre. The lament about
6844,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"his nature being subdued to what it worked in, may be taken as an"
6845,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"ebullition of momentary weakness, even in that robust and manly"
6846,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,temperament. Shakespeare was compounded of too many and too large elements
6847,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"to have been a poet only; and ""art for art's sake,"" wrongly interpreted,"
6848,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"could never have found lodgment in his wide sympathies, his capacious"
6849,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"understanding, and his versatile imagination."
6850,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,
6851,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"If Conservatism may, in a non-party sense, claim Shakespeare as an"
6852,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"authority in its favour, in Milton, on the other hand, I suppose"
6853,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,Liberalism again in a non-party sense would recognise a support. At any
6854,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"rate, Cromwell's secretary was a keen politician, and even a passionate"
6855,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,partisan. I have always thought the allusion made by Walter Scott to him
6856,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"in his Life of Dryden hasty and unfair. ""Waller was awed into silence,"" he"
6857,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"says, ""by the rigour of the puritanic spirit; and even the muse of Milton"
6858,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"was scared from him by the clamour of religious and political controversy,"
6859,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"and only returned, like a sincere friend, to cheer the adversity of one"
6860,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"who had neglected her during his career of worldly importance."" A more"
6861,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"recent writer seems to echo the same charge. ""In 1641,"" he says, ""Milton"
6862,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"stepped into the lists of controversy as a prose writer, beginning the"
6863,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"series of works which, far more than his poetry, gave him his conspicuous"
6864,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"public standing during his lifetime, and have doubtless bereaved the world"
6865,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"of many an immortal verse which it would otherwise have to treasure."" That"
6866,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,Milton's controversial writings gave him more conspicuous public standing
6867,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"in his lifetime than his poetry is indisputable, and not to be wondered"
6868,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,at. A man's contemporaries would naturally rather have him useful than
6869,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"ornamental, provided he be useful on their side; and while persons whose"
6870,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"opinions were furthered by his political writings were, as might have been"
6871,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"expected, more interested in these than in poems from which they reaped no"
6872,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"advantage, those people, on the other hand, to whom his political writings"
6873,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"were obnoxious, felt themselves, as might also have been expected, but"
6874,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"little disposed to extol, or even to read, his poetry. It may, perhaps, be"
6875,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,taken as an absolute rule that a man of letters who takes a conspicuous
6876,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,interest in contemporary politics thereby debars himself to a considerable
6877,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,extent from literary popularity in his lifetime; a matter of little
6878,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"moment, however, since to every reflective mind contemporary popularity is"
6879,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"no pledge of enduring fame, while contemporary neglect is not necessarily"
6880,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,an omen of eternal oblivion. But it is quite another thing to affirm that
6881,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"men of letters who, like Milton, participate freely in the political"
6882,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"controversies of their time ""bereave the world of many an immortal verse,"""
6883,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"or to insinuate, with Scott, that they desert the Muse for ""a career of"
6884,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"worldly importance,"" and only remember its charms in the season of their"
6885,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,adversity. I think any one who has read _Paradise Lost_ and _Paradise
6886,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,Regained_ will be of opinion that Milton wrote quite as much verse as was
6887,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"desirable, whether for our delectation or for his own fame. We see the"
6888,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"appalling result of always writing verse and never doing anything else, in"
6889,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,the portentous bulk bequeathed to us by even so eminent a poet as
6890,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Wordsworth, of matter that his idolaters persist in asking the world to"
6891,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"accept as a precious revelation, but which the world persists, and I"
6892,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"cannot doubt will always persist, in regarding as verse that ought to have"
6893,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"gone up the chimney. Matthew Arnold has, in current phrase, ""boiled down"""
6894,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Wordsworth, in order to make him more palatable to general consumption;"
6895,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,and he gives excellent reasons for having done so.
6896,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,
6897,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"""In Wordsworth's seven volumes,"" he says, ""the pieces of high merit are"
6898,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"mingled with a mass of pieces very inferior to them: so inferior to them,"
6899,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,that it seems wonderful how the same poet should have produced both. Work
6900,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"altogether inferior, work quite uninspired, flat and dull, is produced by"
6901,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"him with evident unconsciousness of its defects, and he presents it to us"
6902,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"with the same faith and seriousness as his best work."""
6903,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,
6904,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Even in the edition of Wordsworth's poetry Matthew Arnold has given us,"
6905,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"and which contains not a tenth of what Wordsworth published, he has"
6906,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"himself exhibited a little too much ""faith and seriousness"" respecting"
6907,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"what he has laboured to save from Lethe, and the ""boiling down"" process"
6908,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,will have to be gone through again by somebody else. The tenth part will
6909,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"have to undergo the operation applied to the whole, and be itself reduced"
6910,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,to another one-tenth. The corn must be winnowed by a yet finer sieve; all
6911,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,the chaff and husk must be blown away; and what then remains will be the
6912,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"_fine fleur_ of poetry indeed. In a word, had Wordsworth, like Milton,"
6913,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"devoted himself, at some season of his life, to public affairs, he would"
6914,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"doubtless have written less verse, and possibly more poetry. Had Milton"
6915,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"abstained altogether from politics, he would possibly have written more"
6916,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"verse, but it is improbable that he would have written more poetry. What"
6917,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"he wrote acquired strength, and even elevation, from his temporary contact"
6918,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,with affairs and his judicious co-operation with the active interests of
6919,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"the State. ""As the giant Antæus,"" says Heine, ""remained invincible in"
6920,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"strength as long as he touched mother earth with his feet, and lost this"
6921,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"power when Hercules lifted him into the air, so also is the poet strong"
6922,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"and mighty as long as he does not abandon the firm ground of reality, but"
6923,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"forfeits his power when he loses himself in the blue ether."" No doubt the"
6924,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"poet must have his head in the air, and no ether need be too high or too"
6925,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,rarefied for his imagination to breathe; but without a strong foothold of
6926,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"the ground he runs the risk of too often lapsing, as Matthew Arnold"
6927,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"affirms Wordsworth constantly lapsed, into ""abstract verbiage,"" or of"
6928,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,falling into intolerable puerilities.
6929,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,
6930,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,Nor is it just to assert that Milton neglected the Muse during his career
6931,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"of worldly importance. It would be as fair to say the same of Dante,"
6932,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"between whom and Milton, in point of genius as well as in vicissitudes of"
6933,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"life, there is a striking similarity. Dante wrote the _Vita Nuova_ at a"
6934,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"comparatively early age, just as Milton wrote _L'Allegro_, _Il Penseroso_,"
6935,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"_Comus_, and _Lycidas_ in the springtime of his life. Then came a pause,"
6936,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"indeed a long silence, for each of them, and it was not till they had"
6937,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,reached the meridian of intellectual life that they betook themselves each
6938,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"to his _magnum opus_, Dante to the _Divina Commedia_, Milton to _Paradise"
6939,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,Lost_. Any one observant of the habit of our best English song-birds must
6940,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"be aware that after singing, with a rapturous lyrical carelessness,"
6941,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"through the vernal months, they become silent during the heat of summer."
6942,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Then in early autumn they sing again, with more measure, more continence,"
6943,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,let us say with more self-criticism and fastidiousness; and though the
6944,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"note may not be so boisterous, it is more mellow and mature."
6945,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,
6946,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"No doubt Dante and Milton did not take this course, of deliberate purpose;"
6947,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"with them, too, it was an instinct; but may we not suspect that poets"
6948,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,would give themselves a better chance of writing works that posterity will
6949,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"not willingly let die, by observing a ""close time,"" a season of summer"
6950,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"silence between the April of the soul when sing they must, and the advent"
6951,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"of the early autumn days, with auburn tints, meditative haze, and grave"
6952,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,tranquil retrospects. Who shall say when the fruits of harvest-time begin
6953,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"to ripen? But this clearly one may affirm, that but for the summer months,"
6954,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"when they seem almost to be stationary in colour, they would never ripen"
6955,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"at all. We know, I think, as a fact, that Milton commenced writing"
6956,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"_Paradise Lost_ some years before the restoration of the Monarchy, but no"
6957,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,one can tell how much earlier still it was really commenced. Milton
6958,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,himself could not have told. The children of the Muse are conceived long
6959,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"before they quicken; and even a lyric, apparently born in a moment, was"
6960,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,often begotten in the darkness and the silence of the days gone by. Works
6961,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,as colossal as the _Divine Comedy_ and _Paradise Lost_ have deep and
6962,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"distant foundations, and the noblest passages of human verse are the"
6963,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,unpremeditated outpourings of men who are habitually plunged in
6964,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"meditation. The least serious reflection upon the subject, if coupled with"
6965,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"any insight into the methods and operations of imaginative genius, will"
6966,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,satisfy anybody that in the very midst of his political controversies and
6967,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,ecclesiastical polemics Milton was in reality already composing _Paradise
6968,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Lost_. Dante never returned to Florence after he was exiled, and it was in"
6969,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"banishment that he wrote the _Divina Commedia_. Yet the ""Sasso di Dante,"""
6970,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"the stone on which he used to sit, gazing intently at the Duomo and at"
6971,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Giotto's Campanile, is one of the sacred sights of the profane Tuscan"
6972,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"city, and his townsmen had already learnt to speak of him as ""One who had"
6973,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"seen Hell."" What enabled him to see it so clearly was his familiarity with"
6974,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,the ways of men and the uncelestial politics of Florence. It was through
6975,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Beatrice and the passion of Love--_Amor, che il ciel governi_--that he"
6976,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"gained access to Paradise, and a knowledge of those things of which he"
6977,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,says:
6978,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,
6979,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,... che ridire
6980,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,Nè sa nè può qual di lassù discende.
6981,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,
6982,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"But the sadness of Purgatory, and the horrors of Hell, these he learned"
6983,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"from the wrangles of Guelph and Ghibelline, of these he obtained mastery"
6984,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"by being, in A.D. 1300, Priore of the fairest, but most mercurial of"
6985,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"cities. We have the authority of Shakespeare, who ought to have been well"
6986,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"informed on that subject, that the lover and the poet are of imagination"
6987,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"all compact, and the brisk air of public policy is the best corrective for"
6988,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,the disease of narrow intensity to which both alike are peculiarly
6989,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,subject.
6990,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,
6991,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"There would be no difficulty, I think, in showing that all the greater men"
6992,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,of letters of the eighteenth century were largely indebted for the
6993,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,literary success they attained to the vivid interest they displayed in
6994,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"public affairs. To mention Dryden, Swift, Pope, Addison is to conjure up"
6995,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,before the mind chapter upon chapter of English political history. Pope
6996,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,says:
6997,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,
6998,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Tories call me Whig, and Whigs a Tory;"
6999,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,
7000,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"and not without some reason, for, like his friend Swift, he cared more for"
7001,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,his own career than for either Party in the State. But no one can read the
7002,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,valuable notes appended by Mr. Courthorpe to his edition of the great
7003,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"satirist, without seeing how alive Pope was to the _quidquid agunt"
7004,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"homines_ of his generation. As for Swift, he was for a time, as the writer"
7005,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"of an admirable paper upon him in the _Quarterly Review_ asserts, the"
7006,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,political dictator of Ireland. When Gibbon betook himself to the task of
7007,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"writing that monumental work which, I find, many persons to-day declare to"
7008,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"be unreadable, but which, I suspect, will be read when the most popular"
7009,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"books of this generation are forgotten, he wisely retired to the studious"
7010,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,quietude of Lausanne. But he narrates how the description of the tactics
7011,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,of Roman legions and the victories of Roman Proconsuls was rendered more
7012,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,facile and familiar to him by his previous experience as a Captain of
7013,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Yeomanry at home, while even his brief tenure of a seat in the British"
7014,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,Parliament enabled him to grasp with more alacrity and precision the
7015,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,legislative conduct of the Conscript Fathers.
7016,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,
7017,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"In the nineteenth century which, despite its many privileges--not the"
7018,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"least of which, perhaps, was that of being able to express a very high"
7019,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"opinion of itself, without at the time being contradicted--enjoyed no"
7020,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"immunity from the general laws of human nature, I think the proposition"
7021,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,still holds good that men of letters who aspire to high distinction do
7022,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,well not to disdain altogether the politics of their time. I have already
7023,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"referred to Wordsworth, and ventured to suggest that he suffered in some"
7024,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"degree, as a poet, from being nothing but a poet. Byron presents a marked"
7025,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"contrast in this respect; and I am still of opinion, which I am comforted"
7026,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"to find is shared by most persons who are men of the world, and by men of"
7027,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"letters who are something more than men of letters, that Byron is, on the"
7028,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"whole, the most considerable English poet since Milton. Art for Art's sake"
7029,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,is a creed that has been embraced by too many critics of our time. Do we
7030,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,not find in this circumstance an explanation of their tendency to extol
7031,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"the quietistic and solitary poets, and, on the other hand, to depreciate"
7032,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,the poets who deal with action and the more complex features of life? It
7033,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,is the business of poets to deal with the relation of the individual to
7034,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"himself, to the silent uniform forces of nature, and to other individuals,"
7035,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"singly and collectively: in other words, to be dramatic or epic, as well"
7036,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,as lyrical or idyllic. All poets of the first rank are both; yet the
7037,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"quietistic and purely introspective critics assign a place, and a prior"
7038,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"place as a rule, in the front rank, to poets who are only second. I cannot"
7039,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,think that conclusions reposing on such demonstrably unsound canons of
7040,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,criticism will permanently hold their ground. Byron contrived to crowd
7041,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,into a very short life a vast amount both of poetry and of public
7042,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,activity; acting upon his own recorded opinion that a man was sent into
7043,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"the world to do something more than to write poetry. A writer who, I"
7044,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"fancy, belongs to the school, now happily becoming obsolete, whose verdict"
7045,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"was that Byron's poetry, though good enough for Scott, Shelley, and"
7046,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Goethe, is only ""the apotheosis of common-place,"" has recently expressed"
7047,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"the opinion that ""Byron would not have gone to Greece if he had not become"
7048,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"tired of the Contessa Guiccioli."" As far as she is concerned, I can only"
7049,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"say, as one who knew her, and has many letters written by her on the"
7050,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"subject of Byron, that if at any time she ever became indifferent to him,"
7051,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,her affection for him experienced a marvellous revival. As for the
7052,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"suggestion that he went to Greece because he was tired of his companion,"
7053,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,it surely was not necessary for a man to go to Greece to get rid of a
7054,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"woman of whom he was tired, and certainly Byron was not the man to"
7055,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"consider the ""world well lost"" for a woman. But the letters he wrote to"
7056,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"his ""companion"" from Greece attest that his affection for her was still"
7057,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,not slight. In any case there is no necessity to cast about one for any
7058,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"reason to explain Byron's going to Greece, beyond the exceedingly simple"
7059,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"one that he was a man of action as well as a poet. Had he lived, instead"
7060,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"of dying, for Greece, I cannot doubt that English poetry would have reaped"
7061,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"a yet more glorious harvest from him, thanks to his incidental experiences"
7062,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,as a soldier and a statesman.
7063,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,
7064,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,The theme is one that easily lends itself to illustration; but enough
7065,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,perhaps has been said to justify the conclusion that it is for the best
7066,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,and highest interests of literature that those who love it before all
7067,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"other things, and cherish it beyond all other considerations, should"
7068,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"nevertheless take a large and liberal view of what constitutes life, and"
7069,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,should include in the excursions of their experience and in the survey of
7070,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"their contemplation what are called politics, or the business and"
7071,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"interests of the State. I do not propose that they should be vestrymen,"
7072,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,though I cannot forget that Shakespeare did not disdain to concern himself
7073,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,in the local business of Stratford-upon-Avon. For men of letters to be
7074,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"willing to interest themselves in politics, politics generally, must be"
7075,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"interesting. The issues raised must be issues of moment and dignity,"
7076,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"issues affecting the greatness of an Empire, the stability of a State, or"
7077,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"the general welfare of humanity. In a country like our own, where Party"
7078,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Government prevails, it is not easy, indeed it is impossible, for a man of"
7079,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"letters to interest himself in politics without inclining, through"
7080,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"sympathy and conviction, to one Party in the State rather than to the"
7081,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"other; and there are occasions, no doubt, when Party issues are synonymous"
7082,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"with the greatness of the Empire, the stability of the State, and the"
7083,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,welfare of mankind. But a wise man of letters will do well to stand more
7084,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"or less aloof from all smaller issues, and to avoid, as degrading to the"
7085,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"character and lowering to the imagination, Party wrangles that are mere"
7086,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,Party wrangles and nothing more.
7087,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,
7088,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"There have been seasons in the history of the human race, melancholy"
7089,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"seasons for the human mind, the ""evil days"" spoken of by Milton, when men"
7090,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"of letters could not, with any self-respect, mix in politics. How much"
7091,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,more highly we should think of Seneca if that literary Stoic had not been
7092,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,a minister of Nero. There was no room for a self-respecting man of letters
7093,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"in French politics during the reign of Napoleon I., none during the"
7094,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"earlier years of the reign of Napoleon III., unless he happened to be a"
7095,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,sincere admirer of a corrupt and brilliant despotism. There are
7096,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"despotisms that are corrupt, or what is equally bad, vulgar and servile,"
7097,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,without being brilliant; and I am not alone in entertaining the fear lest

7103,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,there will be no room in the domain of politics for men of letters who

7106,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,to alter a celebrated phrase--by those services which demagogues render to
7107,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,crowds. If the love and pursuit of literature do not make a man more

7109,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"elevated in his views, they will not have done for him what I should have"
7110,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,expected from them. That politicians pure and simple are becoming less
7111,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"imbued with the literary spirit is, I think, certain, and it is to be"
7112,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"regretted, because polite Politics are almost as much to be desired as"
7113,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"polite Literature, and should be little less imbued with the Horatian"
7114,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"sentiment, _Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros_. Many years ago I heard a"

7119,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,customary mode of speaking of the Sovereign. The imperturbability of
7120,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,Disraeli in debate under the strongest provocation was notoriously one of
7121,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,the secrets of his authority and influence. But it was plain on that

7123,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"But how did he rebut it? ""The right honourable gentleman,"" he said, ""has"

7128,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,have been a more crushing yet a more parliamentary and well-bred rebuke?
7129,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,Mr. Gladstone did not possess the same quiet power of reproval. But his
7130,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"courtesy was uniformly faultless, even when he most indulged in indignant"
7131,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"invective. It is told of Guizot, that, when President of the Council in"
7132,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"France, on being interrupted by his opponents with unseemly clamour, he"
7133,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"observed, ""I do not think, gentlemen, the solution of the controversy will"
7134,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"be assisted by shouting; and such clamour, however loud, will never reach"

7136,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"they must use the rapier, not the tomahawk; and it is Literature, and"
7137,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Literature only, that can adequately teach them how to employ with ample"
7138,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,effect the seemly weapons of debate. If politicians and even Monarchs are
7139,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"wise, they will respect Literature. After all, Literature has always the"
7140,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"last word. ""A hundred years hence,"" said a French poet to a rather saucy"
7141,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"beauty, ""you will be just as beautiful as I choose to say you were""; and"
7142,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,the verses in which he said this have survived. Politicians whom
7143,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,Literature ignores are in the same position. If Literature ignores them
7144,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,they will be forgotten. If Literature condemns them they will stand
7145,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"condemned. But Literature, in turn, should be fair-minded and sincere,"
7146,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"not disingenuous, not a partisan. It wields, in the long run, enormous"
7147,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"power, and therefore has corresponding responsibilities. If the public"
7148,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"taste in any direction, in politics, in letters, or any of the other Arts"
7149,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"grows debased, and current critical opinion follows the debasement,"
7150,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Literature can only stand apart, or loftily reprehend them. Of all"
7151,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"influences, Literature is the most patient, the most persistent, and the"
7152,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"most enduring. Unfairness cannot long injure, malevolence cannot"
7153,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"permanently damage or depreciate it; for, as I have said, Literature,"
7154,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"lofty self-respecting Literature, always has the last word, the final"
7155,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"hearing, political partisanship having no power over the final estimation"
7156,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,in which it is held. At the beginning of the nineteenth century current
7157,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,Tory criticism strove to belittle men of letters who happened to be
7158,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Liberals; and, since Toryism was then in the ascendant, it for a time, but"
7159,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"only for a time, partially succeeded. In our day, and for some few years"
7160,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"past, the influence of Liberalism has been visibly uppermost in current"
7161,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"criticism, which has in turn done scant justice to men of letters"
7162,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"suspected of holding different views. To the latter, as to the great"
7163,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,Liberal poets and other men of letters in the earlier days of the
7164,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"nineteenth century, such patent partisanship can do no lasting injury."
7165,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,Perhaps men of letters might themselves raise the standard of
7166,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"dispassionate criticism were they always fair to each other, and not, as I"
7167,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"fear sometimes happens, be ungenerous to contemporaries, who for one"
7168,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,reason or another are not much favoured by them. There is a curious
7169,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"passage in the 11th Canto of the _Purgatorio_ of the _Divina Commedia_,"
7170,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"where Dante recognises a certain Oderesi, and compliments him on the"
7171,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,talent he showed when on earth as an illuminator or miniature painter.
7172,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"Oderesi replies that Franco Bolognese was his superior in that art, but"
7173,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,"that from jealousy he had failed to allow as much, and adds"
7174,ON THE RELATION OF LITERATURE TO POLITICS,

7203,A CONVERSATION WITH SHAKESPEARE IN THE ELYSIAN FIELDS,the personages among those who are now disporting themselves in the other

7206,A CONVERSATION WITH SHAKESPEARE IN THE ELYSIAN FIELDS,of Knowledge and the Tree of Good and Evil. But I thought she perhaps
7207,A CONVERSATION WITH SHAKESPEARE IN THE ELYSIAN FIELDS,would know as little about them as myself; so I thought I would ask for an

7221,A CONVERSATION WITH SHAKESPEARE IN THE ELYSIAN FIELDS,finally perceived that I was in all the four seasons at one and the same

7224,A CONVERSATION WITH SHAKESPEARE IN THE ELYSIAN FIELDS,"not far from swaying wheat and heavily-burred hop-garden; while, well"
