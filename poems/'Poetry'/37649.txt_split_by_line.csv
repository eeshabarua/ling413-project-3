236,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
237,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"At the commencement of the year 1885, a captivating little volume of"
238,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"poems was mysteriously issued from the ""Leadenhalle Presse"" of Messrs."
239,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"Field and Tuer--a quaint, vellum-bound, antique-looking book, tied up on"
240,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"all sides with strings of golden silk ribbon, and illustrated throughout"
241,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"with fanciful wood-cuts. It was entitled ""Love Letters by a Violinist,"""
242,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,and those who were at first attracted by its title and suggestive
243,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"outward appearance, untied the ribbons with a certain amount of"
244,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"curiosity. Love-letters were surely of a private, almost sacred"
245,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"character. What ""Violinist"" thus ventured to publish his heart-records"
246,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,openly? and were they worth reading? were the questions asked by the
247,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"public, and last, not least, came the natural inquiry, ""_Who_ was the"
248,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"'Violinist'?"" To this no satisfactory answer could be obtained, for"
249,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,nobody knew. But it was directly proved on perusal of the book that he
250,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"was a poet, not a mere writer of verse. Speculations arose as to his"
251,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"identity, and Joseph Ellis, the poet, reviewed the work as follows:--"
252,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
253,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"""Behold a mystery--who shall uncase it? A small quarto, anonymous. The"
254,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,publisher professes entire ignorance of its origin. Wild guesses spring
255,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,from the mask of a 'Violinist'--who can he be? _Unde derivatur?_ A Tyro?
256,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"The work is too skilful for such, though even a Byron. Young? Not old."
257,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"Tennyson? No--he hath not the grace of style, at least for these verses."
258,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"Browning? No--he could not unbend so far. Edwin Arnold might, possibly,"
259,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"have been equal to it, witness, _inter alia_, 'Violetta'; but he is"
260,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"unlikely. Lytton Bulwer, a voice from the tomb? No. His son, Owen"
261,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"Meredith? A random supposition, yet possible. Rossetti--again a voice"
262,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"from the tomb? No--he wanted the strength of wing. James Thomson, the"
263,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"younger, could have done it, but he was too stern. Then, our detective"
264,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"ingenuity proving incompetent, who? We seek the Delphic fane--the oracle"
265,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"replies _Swinburne_. Let us bow to the oracular voice, for in Swinburne"
266,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"we find all requisites for the work--fertility of thought, grace of"
267,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"language, ingenuity, skill in the _ars poetica_, wealth of words,"
268,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"sensuous nature, classic resources. * * * The writer of the"
269,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,'Love-Letters' is manifestly imbued with the tone and tune of Italian
270,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"poetry, and has the merit of proving the English tongue capable of"
271,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,rivalling the Italian '_Canzoni d'Amore_.' * * * * He is a master of
272,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"versification, so is Swinburne--he is praiseworthy for freshness of"
273,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"thought, novelty, and aptness in imagery, so is Swinburne. He is"
274,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"remarkable for sustained energy, so is Swinburne; and thus it may safely"
275,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"be said that, if not the writer of the 'Love-Letters,' he deserves to be"
276,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"accredited with that mysterious production, until the authorship is"
277,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"avowed. * * * * Unto Britannia, as erst to Italia, has been granted a a"
278,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"Petrarch."""
279,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
280,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,Meanwhile other leading voices in the Press joined the swelling chorus
281,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"of praise. _The Morning Post_ took up the theme, and, after vainly"
282,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"endeavouring to clear up the mystery of the authorship, went on to say:"
283,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"""The appearance of this book must be regarded as a literary phenomenon."
284,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,We find ourselves lifted at once by the author's genius out of the
285,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"work-a-day world of the England of to-day, and transported into an"
286,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,atmosphere as rare and ethereal as that in which the poet of Vaucluse
287,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,lived and moved and had his being. * * * * In nearly every stanza there
288,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,are unerring indications of a mind and heart steeped in that subtlest of
289,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"all forms of beauty, the mythology of old Greece. The reader perceives"
290,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"at once that he has to do with a scholar and man of culture, as well as"
291,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"with an inspired singer, whose muse need not feel abashed in the"
292,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"presence of the highest poets of our own day."""
293,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
294,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"Such expressions as, ""A new star of brilliant magnitude has risen above"
295,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,the literary horizon in the anonymous author of the exquisite book of
296,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"'Love-Letters,'"" and ""These poems are among the most graceful and"
297,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"beautiful productions of modern times,"" became frequent in the best"
298,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"literary journals, and private opinion concerning the book began to make"
299,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"its influence felt. The brilliant writer and astute critic, George"
300,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"Meredith, wrote to a friend on the subject as follows:--"
301,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
302,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"""The lines and metre of the poems are easy and interthreading and"
303,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,perfectly melodious. It is an astonishing production--the work of a true
304,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"musician in our tongue."""
305,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
306,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"_The Times'_ special correspondent, Antonio Gallenga, expressed himself"
307,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"at some length on the merits of the ""Violinist,"" and spoke of him ""as"
308,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"one who could conjure up a host of noble thoughts and bright fancies,"
309,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"who rejoices in a great command of language, with a flow of verse and a"
310,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"wealth of rhymes. It is impossible to hear his confessions, to follow"
311,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"him in his aspirations, to hear the tale of his visions, his trances,"
312,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"his dreams, without catching his enthusiasm and bestowing on him our"
313,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,sympathy. Each 'Love-Letter' is in twenty stanzas--each stanza in six
314,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"lines. The poem is regular and symmetrical as Dante's 'Comedy,' with as"
315,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"stately and solemn, aye, and as arduous a measure."" While the world of"
316,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"art and letters thus discussed the volume, reading it meanwhile with"
317,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"such eagerness that the whole edition was soon entirely exhausted, a"
318,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,particularly brilliant and well-written critique of it appeared in the
319,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"New York _Independent_--a very prominent American journal, destined"
320,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"afterwards to declare the author's identity, and to be the first to do"
321,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,so. In the columns of this paper had been frequently seen some
322,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"peculiarly graceful and impassioned poems, signed by one Eric"
323,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"Mackay--notable among these being a lyric entitled ""The Waking of the"
324,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"Lark"" (included in our present volume), which, to quote the expression"
325,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"of a distinguished New York critic, ""sent a thrill through the heart of"
326,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"America."" There are no skylarks in the New World, but there is a deep"
327,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,tenderness felt by all Americans for the little
328,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
329,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"""Priest in grey apparel"
330,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"Who doth prepare to sing in air his sinless summer carol,"""
331,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
332,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,and Eric Mackay's exquisite outburst of tender enthusiasm for the
333,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,English bird of the morning evoked from all parts of the States a chorus
334,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"of critical delight and approbation. The Rev. T. T. Munger, of"
335,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"Massachusetts, wrote concerning it:--"
336,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
337,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"""This strikes me as the best poem I have seen for a long time. As I read"
338,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"it stanza after stanza, with not an imperfect verse, not a commonplace,"
339,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"but with a sustained increase of pure sentiment and glowing fancy, I was"
340,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,inclined to place it beside Shelley's. It is not so intellectual as
341,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"Shelley's, but I am not sure that it is not truer. Mackay's is the lark"
342,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"itself, Shelley's is himself listening to the lark. Besides Shelley"
343,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,makes the lark sing at evening--as I believe it does--but surely 'it to
344,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"the morning doth belong,' and Shakespeare is truer in putting it at"
345,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,'Heaven's gate.' It is a great refreshment to us tired workers in the
346,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"prose of life to come across such a poem as this, and seldom enough it"
347,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"happens nowadays. Tell Mr. Eric Mackay to sing us another song."""
348,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
349,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"Paul Hamilton Hayne, an American poet, praised it in an American paper;"
350,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"and the cultured Maurice Thompson writes:--""This lark-song touches the"
351,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"best mark of simplicity, sweetness, and naturalness in its modelling."""
352,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
353,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,This admired lyric was copied from the _Independent_ into many other
354,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"journals, together with several other poems by the same hand, such as"
355,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"""A Vision of Beethoven,"" the beautiful verses addressed to the Spanish"
356,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"violinist, Pablo de Sarasate, and a spirited reply to Algernon Charles"
357,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"Swinburne, reproaching him for the attack which the author of ""Tristram"
358,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"of Lyonesse"" had made on England's name and fame. One day a simple"
359,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,statement appeared in the _Independent_ respecting the much discussed
360,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"""Love-Letters by a Violinist,"" that the author was simply a gentleman of"
361,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"good position, the descendant of a distinguished and very ancient"
362,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"family, Eric Mackay, known among his personal friends and intimates as a"
363,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"man of brilliant and extensive learning, whose frequent and long"
364,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"residences abroad have made him somewhat of a foreigner, though by birth"
365,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"an Englishman. A fine linguist, a deep thinker, a profound student of"
366,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"the classics, Mr. Mackay may be ranked among the most cultured and"
367,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"accomplished men of his day, and still young as he is, will undoubtedly"
368,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,be numbered with the choice few whose names are destined to live by the
369,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"side of poets such as Keats, whom, as far as careful work, delicate"
370,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"feeling, and fiery tenderness go, Eric Mackay may be said to resemble,"
371,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"though there is a greater robustness and force in his muse, indicative"
372,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"of a strong mind in an equally strong and healthy body, which latter"
373,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"advantage the divine Keats had not, unfortunately for himself and the"
374,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"world. The innate, hardly restrained vigour of Mr. Mackay's nature shows"
375,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"itself in such passages as occur in the sonnets, ""Remorse,"" ""A"
376,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"Thunderstorm at Night;"" also in the wild and terribly suggestive"
377,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"""Zulalie,"" while something of hot wrath and scorn leap out in such lines"
378,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"as those included in his ode to Swinburne, whom he addresses:--"
379,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
380,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"""O thou five foot five"

386,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"With too much honey, and the taste thereof"
387,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"Is sometimes rough, and something of a sting"

395,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"Accept our pardon; or if this offend,"
396,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"Why, then, no pardon, e'en in England's name."
397,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"We have our country still, and thou thy fame!"""
398,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
399,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,At the same time no one in all England does more justice and honor to
400,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,Swinburne's genius than Eric Mackay.
401,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
402,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,His own strength as a poet suggests to the reader the idea of a spirited
403,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"horse reined in tightly and persistently,--a horse which prances wildly"
404,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"at times and frets and foams at the bit, and might, on the least"
405,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"provocation, run wild in a furious and headlong career, sweeping all"
406,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"conventionalities out of its road by a sheer, straight-ahead gallop. Mr."
407,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"Mackay is, however, a careful, even precise rider, and he keeps a firm"
408,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"hand on his restless Pegasus--so firm that, as his taste always leads"
409,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"him to depict the most fanciful and fine emotions, his steady"
410,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,resoluteness of restraint commands not only our admiration but our
411,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"respect. While passionate to an extreme in the ""Love-Letters,"" he is"
412,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"never indelicate; the coarse, almost brutal, allusions made by some"
413,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"writers to certain phases of so-called love, which are best left"
414,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"unsuggested, never defile the pen of our present author, who may almost"
415,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,be called fastidious in such matters. How beautiful and all-sufficing to
416,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,the mind is the line expressing the utter satisfaction of a victorious
417,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,lover:--
418,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
419,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"""_Crowned with a kiss and sceptred with a joy!_"""
420,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
421,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"No details are needed here--all is said. The ""Violinist,"" though by"
422,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"turns regretful, sorrowful, and despairing, is supreme throughout. He"
423,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"speaks of the ""lady of his song"" as"
424,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
425,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"""The lady for whose sake I shall be strong,"
426,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"But never weak or diffident again."""
427,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
428,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"The supremacy of manhood is insisted on always; and the lover, though he"
429,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"entreats, implores, wonders and raves as all lovers do, never forgets"
430,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,his own dignity. He will take no second-best affection on his lady's
431,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"part--this he plainly states in verse 19 of Letter V. Again, in the last"
432,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"letter of all, he asserts his mastery--and this is as it should be;"
433,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"absolute authority, as he knows, is the way to win and to keep a woman's"
434,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,affections. Such lovely fancies as
435,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
436,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"""Phoebus loosens all his golden hair"
437,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,Right down the sky--and daisies turn and stare
438,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"At things we see not with our human wit,"""
439,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
440,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,and
441,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
442,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"""A tuneful noise"
443,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"Broke from the copse where late a breeze was slain,"
444,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,And nightingales in ecstacy of pain
445,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"Did break their hearts with singing the old joys,"""
446,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
447,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,abound all through the book. And here it is as well to mark the
448,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"decision of our poet, even in trifles. The breeze he speaks of is not"
449,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"_hushed_, or _still_--none of the usual epithets are applied to it--it"
450,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"is ""_slain_,"" as utterly and as pitifully as though it were a murdered"
451,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"child. This originality of conception is remarkable, and comes out in"
452,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,such lines as
453,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
454,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"""I will unpack my mind of all its fears""--"
455,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
456,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"where the word ""_unpack_"" is singularly appropriate, and again--"
457,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
458,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"""O sweet To-morrow! Youngest of the sons"
459,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"Of old King Time, _to whom Creation runs_"
460,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"As men to God_."""
461,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"""Where a daisy grows,"
462,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"There grows a joy!"""
463,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
464,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"and beautiful and dainty to a high degree is the quaint ""Retrospect,"""
465,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,where the lover enthusiastically draws the sun and moon into his
466,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"ecstasies, and makes them seem to partake in his admiration of his"
467,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,lady's loveliness.
468,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
469,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"A graver and more philosophic turn of mind will be found in ""A Song of"
470,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"Servitude,"" and ""A Rhapsody of Death;"" but, judged from a critical"
471,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"standpoint, Eric Mackay is a purely passionate poet, straying amongst"
472,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"the most voluptuous imaginings, and sometimes seeming to despise the"
473,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,joys of Heaven itself for the sake of love. Thus he lays himself open to
474,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"an accusation of blasphemy from ultra-religious persons, yet it must be"
475,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,remembered that in this respect he in no way exceeds the emotions of
476,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"Romeo, and Juliet, Paolo and Francesca da Rimini, or any of those lovers"
477,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,whose passion has earned for their names an undying celebrity.
478,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,
479,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,In closing the present notice we can but express a hope that this volume
480,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,of Eric Mackay's poems may meet with the welcome it deserves from true
481,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,"lovers of Art; for Art includes Poetry; and Poetry, as properly defined"
482,INTRODUCTORY NOTICE,is one of its grandest and most enduring forms.
