57,CONTENTS,Author's Introduction
58,CONTENTS,
59,CONTENTS,To you who have lifted the veil of mists o'er-blown
60,CONTENTS,And gazed in the eyes of dawn when night had flown--
61,CONTENTS,Have felt in your hearts a thrill of sheer delight
62,CONTENTS,As you scanned the scene below from some alpine height--
63,CONTENTS,I extend this fleeting glimpse across a world
64,CONTENTS,Of forest and meadow land--at last unfurled--
65,CONTENTS,Through vistas of soaring peaks with frosted crest
66,CONTENTS,In the fiorded wonderland of this--last--west.

71,CONTENTS,October Daybreak on Boundary Bay
72,CONTENTS,
73,CONTENTS,A skyline bold and clear
74,CONTENTS,"Of cold sharp corniced snow,"
75,CONTENTS,"Where, bulking huge, the mass of Baker's cone"
76,CONTENTS,Shadows the world below.
77,CONTENTS,
78,CONTENTS,'Tis bright with promise now!
79,CONTENTS,That flood and field
80,CONTENTS,"Still shrouded in the mystery of night,"
81,CONTENTS,Will shortly be revealed.
82,CONTENTS,
83,CONTENTS,The wildfowl on the bay
84,CONTENTS,Call to the distant flight
85,CONTENTS,"Of ducks, that swoop from out the realms of space,"
86,CONTENTS,Seeking a place to light.
87,CONTENTS,
88,CONTENTS,Sounds through the waking hours
89,CONTENTS,"The beating of countless wings,"
90,CONTENTS,Faint voices floating through the upper air
91,CONTENTS,In softest whisperings.
92,CONTENTS,
93,CONTENTS,A blush of coming day
94,CONTENTS,"Flooding the eastern sky,"
95,CONTENTS,"Fresh rosy Dawn climbing the rampart hills,"
96,CONTENTS,Forces the night to fly:
97,CONTENTS,
98,CONTENTS,Then from his lair the sun
99,CONTENTS,Leaps forth. The fading gleam
100,CONTENTS,Of silver moon and silent stars is quenched.
101,CONTENTS,Day reigns once more supreme.
102,CONTENTS,
103,CONTENTS,The Last Arete
104,CONTENTS,
105,CONTENTS,Alpinist--
106,CONTENTS,"Excelsior, there's nought we may not dare!"
107,CONTENTS,"Why, now, confess defeat, when plain in sight"
108,CONTENTS,Looms the stern peak--to which we've toiled and fought
109,CONTENTS,Up many a mountain gorge and soaring height?
110,CONTENTS,It were a shame if we should now go back
111,CONTENTS,"And, leaving all we've won, retrace our track."
112,CONTENTS,
113,CONTENTS,"Undaunted by the circling mists we camped,"
114,CONTENTS,"Laid siege; while hail and snow went storming by,"
115,CONTENTS,Assaulted through the brilliant mists; that wrapped
116,CONTENTS,"A veil, impenetrable to the eye,"
117,CONTENTS,"Around the wastes of ice, the snowfields bare"
118,CONTENTS,And craggy peaks that pierce the upper air.
119,CONTENTS,
120,CONTENTS,"We scorned to own defeat, when lost to sight,"
121,CONTENTS,"'Mid cloud and snowstorm, was that summit cold;"
122,CONTENTS,But started out the morn e're yet the sun
123,CONTENTS,The highest cornices had edged with gold.
124,CONTENTS,See now! the noonday glare reveals our fate
125,CONTENTS,Above a rampart white and sharp arete.
126,CONTENTS,
127,CONTENTS,Guide--
128,CONTENTS,Crevasses open-mouthed have reft the face
129,CONTENTS,"Of brightly gleaming ice, that upward led."
130,CONTENTS,Their clear green depths a gap impassable present
131,CONTENTS,Across the glacier slope ahead;
132,CONTENTS,Save on yon steep and scintillating slope
133,CONTENTS,Which promises success to axe and rope.
134,CONTENTS,
135,CONTENTS,Alpinist--
136,CONTENTS,Roped man to man we'll scale the giddy height:
137,CONTENTS,Step after step cut up those slopes of snow
138,CONTENTS,"That, gleaming spotless in the noonday light,"
139,CONTENTS,Curve out of sight above and far below.
140,CONTENTS,What rumbled? (G.) From yon distant cliff was hurled
141,CONTENTS,An avalanche which shakes this snowy world.
142,CONTENTS,
143,CONTENTS,Guide--
144,CONTENTS,The rocks I've gained through chimneys rough and steep
145,CONTENTS,"That crumble at a careless touch, and send"
146,CONTENTS,A rattling train of rubble bounding down
147,CONTENTS,"The icy slopes, which great crevasses rend."
148,CONTENTS,Re-entrant over here the mountain dips
149,CONTENTS,"Into a gulf, which eddying mists eclipse."
150,CONTENTS,
151,CONTENTS,"Perched on this tottering and steep arete,"
152,CONTENTS,One hardly dares to even whisper low;
153,CONTENTS,"Lest, crashing from their crumbling pedestals,"
154,CONTENTS,The rotten crags through empty space will go
155,CONTENTS,"Two thousand feet down, where the hard neve"
156,CONTENTS,Is packed by ice that avalanched that way.
157,CONTENTS,
158,CONTENTS,"I'll anchor fast, and hold the rope, that you"
159,CONTENTS,By hand and foot and alpenstock may scale.
160,CONTENTS,A traverse of the skyline rocks we'll make
161,CONTENTS,And yon last gleaming slope of snow assail.
162,CONTENTS,"It leads up to a virgin mountain's head,"
163,CONTENTS,On which our feet will be the first to tread.

166,CONTENTS,
167,CONTENTS,"The highest of a glacier covered range,"
168,CONTENTS,Its proud and lofty crest at length hath bowed
169,CONTENTS,Before the bold attack of alpinists
170,CONTENTS,Undaunted by the steeps or storm or cloud;
171,CONTENTS,and all the dangers than in grim array
172,CONTENTS,The spirit of the mountain brought to play.

175,CONTENTS,
176,CONTENTS,[*]The Great Divide
177,CONTENTS,
178,CONTENTS,What strange emotions fill my breast!
179,CONTENTS,What flitting shadows of unrest
180,CONTENTS,Sweep o'er me as I stand beside
181,CONTENTS,"The Rocky Mountains' ""Great Divide."""
182,CONTENTS,
183,CONTENTS,"That rustic arch, with letters bold"
184,CONTENTS,"Against the summit snowfields cold,"
185,CONTENTS,Has power to wing my fancy far
186,CONTENTS,To this split streamlet's furthest bar.
187,CONTENTS,
188,CONTENTS,"The icy flood is cleft in twain,"
189,CONTENTS,Its waters never meet again;
190,CONTENTS,Far east and to the furthest west
191,CONTENTS,Those wavelets hurry without rest.
192,CONTENTS,
193,CONTENTS,The mind can hardly grasp such vast
194,CONTENTS,Extent of territory passed
195,CONTENTS,"E're these two streams shall reach the sea,"
196,CONTENTS,At different oceans to be free.
197,CONTENTS,
198,CONTENTS,"Through valleys wide and fertile plain,"
199,CONTENTS,Where yellow fields of waving grain
200,CONTENTS,"Are garnered for the wide world's store,"
201,CONTENTS,One stream flows to a distant shore.
202,CONTENTS,
203,CONTENTS,May be that harnessed it will drive
204,CONTENTS,The wheels which in some human hive
205,CONTENTS,Of industry are waiting for
206,CONTENTS,The power that it holds in store
207,CONTENTS,
208,CONTENTS,"To saw the timber, thresh the grain"
209,CONTENTS,And even haul the loaded train
210,CONTENTS,By energy electrical
211,CONTENTS,As though some wizard wove a spell.
212,CONTENTS,
213,CONTENTS,"Such small beginnings mark this stream,"
214,CONTENTS,It almost seems to be a dream
215,CONTENTS,That carries me in mind away
216,CONTENTS,Along its course to Hudson's Bay.
217,CONTENTS,
218,CONTENTS,Far down the other branch we roam
219,CONTENTS,"By smiling lakes, and watch the foam"
220,CONTENTS,Of rapid streams that flow between
221,CONTENTS,Fair orchard lands and meadows green.
222,CONTENTS,
223,CONTENTS,The silv'ry salmon leaps the falls;
224,CONTENTS,And everywhere insistent calls
225,CONTENTS,"Arise from forest, stream and hill,"
226,CONTENTS,To charm the sense or test the skill.
227,CONTENTS,
228,CONTENTS,"Oft times by restlessness oppressed,"
229,CONTENTS,I long to see that lonely crest;
230,CONTENTS,And once again to dream beside
231,CONTENTS,"The arch, that's lettered ""Great Divide."""
232,CONTENTS,
233,CONTENTS,
234,CONTENTS,[*]A watershed of the Rockies--a stream passing beneath an arch
235,CONTENTS,"on the summit is divided, one part being directed eastward and"
236,CONTENTS,the other westward.
237,CONTENTS,
238,CONTENTS,
239,CONTENTS,
240,CONTENTS,
241,CONTENTS,Above the Clouds
242,CONTENTS,
243,CONTENTS,On the shores of a sea of mist
244,CONTENTS,"I chanced to roam,"
245,CONTENTS,Where sunlit the surface gleamed
246,CONTENTS,Whiter than foam.
247,CONTENTS,
248,CONTENTS,But the voice of the restless main
249,CONTENTS,"Was absent there,"
250,CONTENTS,For the billows that rolled along
251,CONTENTS,Were waves of air;
252,CONTENTS,
253,CONTENTS,And the isles of that silent sea
254,CONTENTS,Were mountain peaks
255,CONTENTS,"That, far from the haunts of man,"
256,CONTENTS,The wild goat seeks.
257,CONTENTS,
258,CONTENTS,"O, that day above the clouds"
259,CONTENTS,Was bright and fair!
260,CONTENTS,With pines and the sparkling snow
261,CONTENTS,Unsullied there;
262,CONTENTS,
263,CONTENTS,"But, a thousand fathoms down"
264,CONTENTS,A city street
265,CONTENTS,Was shrouded in sunless gloom
266,CONTENTS,Where shadows meet;
267,CONTENTS,
268,CONTENTS,It knew not the fairer day
269,CONTENTS,And matchless view;
270,CONTENTS,That snowfields gleamed above
271,CONTENTS,And skies were blue:
272,CONTENTS,
273,CONTENTS,That the clouds which gloomed below
274,CONTENTS,Were seas of light
275,CONTENTS,From another point of view
276,CONTENTS,At greater height.
277,CONTENTS,
278,CONTENTS,
279,CONTENTS,
280,CONTENTS,
281,CONTENTS,Winter Sunset in the Cascade Range
282,CONTENTS,
283,CONTENTS,Picture a world of snowfields
284,CONTENTS,"Aglow in the sunset light,"
285,CONTENTS,Great fir trees snow-flake laden
286,CONTENTS,And broken clouds piled white;
287,CONTENTS,While bathed in a silver sheen
288,CONTENTS,The pines on a crest are seen.
289,CONTENTS,
290,CONTENTS,Would I could frame the language
291,CONTENTS,"Worthy those sunset tints,"
292,CONTENTS,"Hued from saffron to coral,"
293,CONTENTS,Aflame where the sunlight glints;
294,CONTENTS,And the clear steel blue of the sky
295,CONTENTS,Where the clouds had drifted by.
296,CONTENTS,
297,CONTENTS,The daylight slowly faded.
298,CONTENTS,Weakly mere words convey
299,CONTENTS,"The ivory white of snowflakes,"
300,CONTENTS,Decking the hills that day;
301,CONTENTS,And the softening yellow tone
302,CONTENTS,That fell from the sun god's throne.
303,CONTENTS,
304,CONTENTS,Far beyond wooded ridges
305,CONTENTS,"Lit with a twilight ray,"
306,CONTENTS,Sentinel like in the cloudland
307,CONTENTS,A nameless peak held sway;
308,CONTENTS,Keeping a silent guard
309,CONTENTS,O'er valleys by cloud wreaths barred.
310,CONTENTS,
311,CONTENTS,'Twas crowned with flaming colours
312,CONTENTS,Of sunset's fleeting hour;
313,CONTENTS,Giving its best expression
314,CONTENTS,To nature's lavish dower
315,CONTENTS,E're the ebbing tide of day
316,CONTENTS,Should fade from the world away.
317,CONTENTS,
318,CONTENTS,Then light melted softly to shadow
319,CONTENTS,"And the blue of the sky turned grey,"
320,CONTENTS,While a veil of deepening twilight
321,CONTENTS,"Warned us to haste away,"
322,CONTENTS,For the winter nights are bleak
323,CONTENTS,In the wilds by that lonely peak.
324,CONTENTS,
325,CONTENTS,
326,CONTENTS,
327,CONTENTS,
328,CONTENTS,[*]Beside the Ocstall
329,CONTENTS,
330,CONTENTS,I mused one day beside the Ocstall River
331,CONTENTS,Where trailing mists went drifting softly by;
332,CONTENTS,"And waterfalls in thunderous voices calling,"
333,CONTENTS,Their vaporous breath raised to a burdened sky.
334,CONTENTS,
335,CONTENTS,What mystic spell? what strange compelling passion
336,CONTENTS,Did hold the sons of Britain toiling there?
337,CONTENTS,What charm was there in that great lonely region
338,CONTENTS,"Enticing them from distant lands, more fair?"
339,CONTENTS,
340,CONTENTS,Fantastic cloud wreaths draped a sea of mountains:
341,CONTENTS,Forest and muskeg in the vales held sway;
342,CONTENTS,To win a fortune from those wild surroundings
343,CONTENTS,"Men came, then could not from them break away."
344,CONTENTS,
345,CONTENTS,They tried the lands where everlasting sunshine
346,CONTENTS,Caressed lush fruits and kissed the waves at play;
347,CONTENTS,But no place gripped them like this western outpost
348,CONTENTS,Where men with large ambitions hewed their way.
349,CONTENTS,
350,CONTENTS,It was the challenge to the daring spirit
351,CONTENTS,Of vast resources in their native state.
352,CONTENTS,"It was the lure of gold, romance of action,"
353,CONTENTS,The chances of success where stakes were great.
354,CONTENTS,
355,CONTENTS,
356,CONTENTS,[*]Ocstall River--a tributary of the Skeena near its mouth.

358,CONTENTS,
359,CONTENTS,
360,CONTENTS,
361,CONTENTS,Jansen's Curse
362,CONTENTS,
363,CONTENTS,"'Twas out upon a gold stampede,"
364,CONTENTS,And Jan had always planned to lead.
365,CONTENTS,"The man who has the greatest might,"
366,CONTENTS,"He surely must be in the right,"
367,CONTENTS,Was part of Jansen's creed;
368,CONTENTS,"For very skookum[1] was this man,"
369,CONTENTS,Built on a most ambitious plan;
370,CONTENTS,"But with a domineering trait,"
371,CONTENTS,"Would have his own, no other way;"
372,CONTENTS,And often had been heard to say:
373,CONTENTS,"""I'll be no 'also ran.'"""
374,CONTENTS,The river trip he hoped to make
375,CONTENTS,"With an old-timer nicknamed Jake,"
376,CONTENTS,Who'd hired a canoe;
377,CONTENTS,And with a bunch of sourdoughs[2]
378,CONTENTS,"Intended, e're the river rose"
379,CONTENTS,"In flood, to push on through."
380,CONTENTS,This man soon got himself disliked
381,CONTENTS,As up the rapid stream they piked
382,CONTENTS,And oft by rapids lined.
383,CONTENTS,His overbearing ways were met
384,CONTENTS,With keen expressions of regret
385,CONTENTS,He'd not been left behind.
386,CONTENTS,At length the crew a village saw
387,CONTENTS,Of Indians who had a store
388,CONTENTS,In goods where Jan did trade.
389,CONTENTS,The others knew their chance at last
390,CONTENTS,They could not get away too fast
391,CONTENTS,When off ashore he'd strayed.
392,CONTENTS,"They threw his pack out on the bank,"
393,CONTENTS,Their late companion's health they drank
394,CONTENTS,With hopes they'd never meet;
395,CONTENTS,"But Jan, their move when he realized,"
396,CONTENTS,"Came hurrying greatly surprised,"
397,CONTENTS,And flushed with angry heat.
398,CONTENTS,Some most profane remarks he made
399,CONTENTS,And said that he was not afraid
400,CONTENTS,"To thrash the blooming crew,"
401,CONTENTS,"Their ancestors were not forgot,"
402,CONTENTS,He hoped old Nick would make it hot
403,CONTENTS,For any that he knew.
404,CONTENTS,"One parting curse did Jan call down,"
405,CONTENTS,He hoped they all would surely drown
406,CONTENTS,Before they reached their goal;
407,CONTENTS,"The waters be their winding sheet,"
408,CONTENTS,That Hell would raise a double heat
409,CONTENTS,To welcome every soul.
410,CONTENTS,Then taking up his pack he set
411,CONTENTS,His face towards the trail that yet
412,CONTENTS,Along the river ran.
413,CONTENTS,"But soon the blazes were no more,"
414,CONTENTS,"His path was barred by creeks, a score,"
415,CONTENTS,Which now no bridges span.
416,CONTENTS,"He felled the towering cottonwood,"
417,CONTENTS,"That graceful by the river stood,"
418,CONTENTS,To bridge each torrent wide.
419,CONTENTS,"But longest spans were swept away,"
420,CONTENTS,By the wild waters in their play
421,CONTENTS,At the last creek he tried.
422,CONTENTS,So plunging in the torrent wild
423,CONTENTS,"Which swept him helpless as a child,"
424,CONTENTS,He braved its swollen tide.
425,CONTENTS,"While raced along a branch he caught,"
426,CONTENTS,"That, waving from the shore long sought,"
427,CONTENTS,Was like an arm outstretched.
428,CONTENTS,He pulled himself hand over hand
429,CONTENTS,Until his feet could feel the sand
430,CONTENTS,By eddying currents fetched.
431,CONTENTS,"His pack was soaked with water through,"
432,CONTENTS,"There was no trail ahead he knew,"
433,CONTENTS,But still kept on his way;
434,CONTENTS,And with determination strong
435,CONTENTS,Struggled the beach and cliffs along
436,CONTENTS,While held the light each day.
437,CONTENTS,"At length he reached the little creek,"
438,CONTENTS,"The which he had set out to seek,"
439,CONTENTS,And found some partners there.
440,CONTENTS,They had begun to pan the sand
441,CONTENTS,Which proved to be a golden strand
442,CONTENTS,At last to them laid bare.
443,CONTENTS,One day in camp the word went round
444,CONTENTS,That Jake and all his crew had drowned
445,CONTENTS,Between the canyon walls.
446,CONTENTS,Their staunch canoe was seen upturned
447,CONTENTS,Where white the boiling rapids churned
448,CONTENTS,Below the waterfalls.
449,CONTENTS,
450,CONTENTS,*      *      *      *
451,CONTENTS,
452,CONTENTS,Small wonder if Jan's conscience woke
453,CONTENTS,And if that moral guardian spoke
454,CONTENTS,In accusation strong
455,CONTENTS,"Against the words he had let fall,"
456,CONTENTS,"Beyond the power of recall,"
457,CONTENTS,To get revenge for wrong.

467,CONTENTS,

469,CONTENTS,Ill fortune had detained;
470,CONTENTS,Bacon and beans were finished;
471,CONTENTS,"Of flour, none remained."
472,CONTENTS,
473,CONTENTS,"But now with tents and blankets,"
474,CONTENTS,"Facing the backward track,"
475,CONTENTS,All hands were feeling cheerful
476,CONTENTS,Save the cook--his looks were black.
477,CONTENTS,
478,CONTENTS,They'd packed across the mountains
479,CONTENTS,"Where trails were never known,"
480,CONTENTS,Through leagues of heavy timber
481,CONTENTS,And rock slides overgrown;
482,CONTENTS,
483,CONTENTS,Had bridged the swollen torrents
484,CONTENTS,By felling trees across;
485,CONTENTS,And scrambled through the canyons
486,CONTENTS,That walled the river's course.
487,CONTENTS,
488,CONTENTS,The horses of the pack train
489,CONTENTS,Had died in dark despair
490,CONTENTS,When brought to face the prospect
491,CONTENTS,Of using goat trails there;
492,CONTENTS,
493,CONTENTS,So man a beast of burden
494,CONTENTS,Himself was forced to be;
495,CONTENTS,The crew packed grub and blankets
496,CONTENTS,"And the cook the cutlery,"
497,CONTENTS,
498,CONTENTS,"The dishpans and the kettles,"
499,CONTENTS,"The basins and a pot,"
500,CONTENTS,"A battered old reflector,"
501,CONTENTS,"Cups, bowls and plates, Great Scott!"
502,CONTENTS,
503,CONTENTS,Cymbals and drums weren't in it
504,CONTENTS,When cook did have a spill;
505,CONTENTS,The crash of warlike music
506,CONTENTS,Echoed from hill to hill
507,CONTENTS,
508,CONTENTS,"As down his pack came bounding,"
509,CONTENTS,"Spurning the canyon walls,"
510,CONTENTS,"Scattering pots and dishes,"
511,CONTENTS,Leaping the waterfalls.
512,CONTENTS,
513,CONTENTS,The packers looked in terror
514,CONTENTS,To see the cook come too
515,CONTENTS,As past their dizzy erie
516,CONTENTS,The clanging luggage flew;
517,CONTENTS,
518,CONTENTS,"When anxiously they hailed him,"
519,CONTENTS,"The cook, he only swore:"
520,CONTENTS,"""If I survive this picnic"
521,CONTENTS,"So help me--nevermore."""

527,CONTENTS,
528,CONTENTS,The tale was told by a hunter bold
529,CONTENTS,"Of a sealing schooner's crew,"
530,CONTENTS,Of a midnight raid where the breakers played
531,CONTENTS,On reefs that the offing strew.
532,CONTENTS,

536,CONTENTS,Dared the reefs and ocean swell.
537,CONTENTS,
538,CONTENTS,"""A rascal bold, in misdeeds grown old,"
539,CONTENTS,He had raided far and wide;
540,CONTENTS,But never before in the sealers' lore
541,CONTENTS,Had the Pribilof[1] reefs been tried.
542,CONTENTS,
543,CONTENTS,"""But an Aleut[2], by his sealskin boot"
544,CONTENTS,"And the grave of his father, swore"
545,CONTENTS,For a keg of booze and a pair of shoes
546,CONTENTS,"To sell their secret, and more."
547,CONTENTS,
548,CONTENTS,"""So Hansen knew to a yard or two"
549,CONTENTS,Where the hidden ledges ran;
550,CONTENTS,And the breakers' roar on the reefs and shore
551,CONTENTS,Were guides to the daring man.
552,CONTENTS,
553,CONTENTS,"""The trailing kelp and a flash might help"
554,CONTENTS,"Where the phosphorus burned bright,"
555,CONTENTS,For the deed was done past set of sun

985,M. F.--,"I'll look into her eyes, their love light showing,"
986,M. F.--,Small need of words we'll know;
987,M. F.--,"For tender glances sprung from hearts aglowing,"
988,M. F.--,With meaning overflow.
989,M. F.--,
990,M. F.--,Cupid--
991,M. F.--,Such sentiments as these I quite approve:
992,M. F.--,I'm hopeful for the outcome of your love.
993,M. F.--,
994,M. F.--,Cupid (turning to Frosties)--
995,M. F.--,Who are these furry folk that round us stand?
996,M. F.--,They seem like members of the Frosties' band.
997,M. F.--,
998,M. F.--,Frosties (in chorus)--
999,M. F.--,"We are the elves of the Northern Light,"
1000,M. F.--,Of the ice blink and the snow;
1001,M. F.--,"We deck the moss with a silver floss,"
1002,M. F.--,And make the frost flowers grow.
1003,M. F.--,
1004,M. F.--,We place the fetters on stream and rill
1005,M. F.--,And encase the lakes and seas:
1006,M. F.--,We spread a carpet o'er vale and hill
1007,M. F.--,And drape the leafless trees.
1008,M. F.--,
1009,M. F.--,Cupid--
1010,M. F.--,Won't you just tell dear Frosties
1011,M. F.--,In the language of song to-night
1012,M. F.--,Of those beauties and silent wonders
1013,M. F.--,That dwell in the Northern Light.
1014,M. F.--,
1015,M. F.--,Sing of some thrilling vision
1016,M. F.--,"Of those beams in endless train,"
1017,M. F.--,Like the bars of a thousand searchlights;
1018,M. F.--,Sing to us Frosties again.

1021,M. F.--,The Northern Lights
1022,M. F.--,
1023,M. F.--,Master Frosty--
1024,M. F.--,Across the starry arches of the heavens
1025,M. F.--,Like mighty spokes of a revolving wheel;
1026,M. F.--,Or organ pipes that grouped in stately silence
1027,M. F.--,Await some master's touch to wake their peal;
1028,M. F.--,
1029,M. F.--,The Northern Lights had strayed far down the vistas
1030,M. F.--,Of mellow air that mark the temperate zone;
1031,M. F.--,Their searchlight beams above the northern skyline
1032,M. F.--,A magic arch of changing lights had thrown.
1033,M. F.--,
1034,M. F.--,They marched across the sky in long procession:
1035,M. F.--,"From east to west their standards were unfurled,"
1036,M. F.--,Summoning visions of the Arctic winter
1037,M. F.--,And whalers prisoned in a frozen world.
1038,M. F.--,
1039,M. F.--,"Then formed a tent, across the starry heavens,"
1040,M. F.--,Woven of interlacing beams of light
1041,M. F.--,"Flung lightly o'er the arches which supported,"
1042,M. F.--,"High overhead, the canopy of night."
1043,M. F.--,
1044,M. F.--,Once more a wide and undulating archway
1045,M. F.--,"Expressed in quivering jets of frosty flame,"
1046,M. F.--,"Against the background of the midnight shadows,"
1047,M. F.--,"With play of countless brilliant flashes, came;"
1048,M. F.--,
1049,M. F.--,While dark below flowed on the silent ocean:
1050,M. F.--,An anchored barque swayed slowly on the swell.
1051,M. F.--,And here and there a phosphorescent glimmer
1052,M. F.--,Showed where the trailing seaweed rose and fell.
1053,M. F.--,
1054,M. F.--,Cupid--
1055,M. F.--,"I thank you, Frosties, for your song and story"
1056,M. F.--,About the Northern Lights in all their glory;
1057,M. F.--,"But time is hasting on, I must be going."
1058,M. F.--,The sun through lengthened days is warmly glowing.
1059,M. F.--,Farewell Paolo too: what shall I say
1060,M. F.--,When I shall meet your maiden on my way?
1061,M. F.--,
1062,M. F.--,Paolo--
1063,M. F.--,"Haste, Cupid; haste: fly forth on rapid wing"
1064,M. F.--,Bearing your dainty bow and feathered darts;
1065,M. F.--,And with the graceful practise of your arts
1066,M. F.--,"Whisper into my darling's ear, or sing"
1067,M. F.--,The sweetest messages that love can bring;
1068,M. F.--,And weave such tender dreams as spring imparts
1069,M. F.--,Where youth and beauty know each others hearts
1070,M. F.--,And feel the thrill that from such joy can spring.
1071,M. F.--,"Sweet cherub, when you wing your arrow's flight,"
1072,M. F.--,Speed it away with thoughts of love from me;
1073,M. F.--,"And when it finds the heart that beats with mine,"
1074,M. F.--,Full welcome to that breast I know 'twill be.
1075,M. F.--,When you reveal my message in love's light
1076,M. F.--,It's: (Dearest will you be my valentine).
1077,M. F.--,
1078,M. F.--,Cupid--
1079,M. F.--,"This errand suits me well, I'll not delay;"
1080,M. F.--,But to the land of flowers will wing my way.

1093,M. F.--,"Farewell, dear Cupid,"
