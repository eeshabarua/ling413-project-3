173,AFTERWARD.,AFTERWARD.
174,AFTERWARD.,
175,AFTERWARD.,There _is_ no vacant chair.  The loving meet--
176,AFTERWARD.,"A group unbroken--smitten, who knows how?"
177,AFTERWARD.,"One sitteth silent only, in his usual seat;"
178,AFTERWARD.,We gave him once that freedom.  Why not now?
179,AFTERWARD.,
180,AFTERWARD.,"Perhaps he is too weary, and needs rest;"
181,AFTERWARD.,"He needed it too often, nor could we"
182,AFTERWARD.,"Bestow.  God gave it, knowing how to do so best."
183,AFTERWARD.,Which of us would disturb him?  Let him be.
184,AFTERWARD.,
185,AFTERWARD.,There is no vacant chair.  If he will take
186,AFTERWARD.,"The mood to listen mutely, be it done."
187,AFTERWARD.,"By his least mood we crossed, for which the heart must ache,"
188,AFTERWARD.,Plead not nor question!  Let him have this one.
189,AFTERWARD.,
190,AFTERWARD.,Death is a mood of life.  It is no whim
191,AFTERWARD.,By which life's Giver mocks a broken heart.
192,AFTERWARD.,"Death is life's reticence.  Still audible to Him,"
193,AFTERWARD.,"The hushed voice, happy, speaketh on, apart."
194,AFTERWARD.,
195,AFTERWARD.,There is no vacant chair.  To love is still
196,AFTERWARD.,"To have.  Nearer to memory than to eye,"
197,AFTERWARD.,"And dearer yet to anguish than to comfort, will"
198,AFTERWARD.,"We hold him by our love, that shall not die."
199,AFTERWARD.,
200,AFTERWARD.,"For while it doth not, thus he cannot.  Try!"
201,AFTERWARD.,Who can put out the motion or the smile?
202,AFTERWARD.,The old ways of being noble all with him laid by?
203,AFTERWARD.,"Because we love, he is.  Then trust awhile."
204,AFTERWARD.,
205,AFTERWARD.,
206,AFTERWARD.,
207,AFTERWARD.,
208,RELEASED.,RELEASED.
209,RELEASED.,
210,RELEASED.,"Oh, joy of the dying!"
211,RELEASED.,At last thou art mine.
212,RELEASED.,"And leaping to meet thee,"
213,RELEASED.,"Impatient to greet thee,"
214,RELEASED.,"A rapid and rapturous, sensitive, fine"
215,RELEASED.,"Gayety steals through my pulses to-day,"
216,RELEASED.,Daring and doubting like pleasure
217,RELEASED.,"Forbidden, or Winter looking at May."
218,RELEASED.,
219,RELEASED.,"Oh, sorrow of living!"
220,RELEASED.,Make way for the thrill
221,RELEASED.,Of the soul that is starting--
222,RELEASED.,Onlooking--departing
223,RELEASED.,Across the threshold of clay.
224,RELEASED.,"Bend, bow to the will"
225,RELEASED.,Of the soul that is up and away!

231,THE ROOM'S WIDTH.,
232,THE ROOM'S WIDTH.,"I think if I should cross the room,"
233,THE ROOM'S WIDTH.,Far as fear;
234,THE ROOM'S WIDTH.,Should stand beside you like a thought--
235,THE ROOM'S WIDTH.,"Touch you, Dear!"
236,THE ROOM'S WIDTH.,
237,THE ROOM'S WIDTH.,Like a fancy.  To your sad heart
238,THE ROOM'S WIDTH.,It would seem
239,THE ROOM'S WIDTH.,"That my vision passed and prayed you,"
240,THE ROOM'S WIDTH.,Or my dream.
241,THE ROOM'S WIDTH.,
242,THE ROOM'S WIDTH.,Then you would look with lonely eyes--
243,THE ROOM'S WIDTH.,Lift your head--
244,THE ROOM'S WIDTH.,"And you would stir, and sigh, and say--"
245,THE ROOM'S WIDTH.,"""She is dead."""
246,THE ROOM'S WIDTH.,
247,THE ROOM'S WIDTH.,"Baffled by death and love, I lean"
248,THE ROOM'S WIDTH.,Through the gloom.

256,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,
257,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,The shadows watch about the house;
258,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,"Silent as they, I come."
259,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,"Oh, it is true that life is deaf,"
260,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,And not that death is dumb.
261,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,
262,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,"The Christmas thrill is on the earth,"
263,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,The stars throb in the sky.
264,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,"Love listens in a thousand homes,--"
265,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,The Christmas bells ring by.
266,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,
267,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,I cross the old familiar door
268,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,And take the dear old chair.
269,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,You look with desolated eyes
270,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,Upon me sitting there.
271,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,
272,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,"You gaze and see not, though the tears"
273,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,In gazing burn and start.
274,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,"Believe, the living are the blind,"
275,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,Not that the dead depart.
276,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,
277,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,A year ago some words we said
278,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,"Kept sacred 'twixt us twain,"
279,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,"'T is you, poor Love, who answer not,"
280,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,The while I speak again.
281,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,
282,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,"I lean above you as before,"
283,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,"Faithful, my arms enfold."
284,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,"Oh, could you know that life is numb,"
285,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,Nor think that death is cold!
286,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,
287,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,"Senses of earth, how weak ye are!"
288,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,"Joys, joys of Heaven how strong!"
289,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,"Loves of the earth, how short and sad,"
290,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,Of Heaven how glad and long!
291,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,
292,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,Heart of my heart! if earth or Heaven
293,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,Had speech or language fine
294,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,"Enough, or death or life could give"
295,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,"Me symbol, sound, or sign"
296,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,
297,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,"To reach you--thought, or touch, or eye,"
298,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,Body or soul--I 'd die
299,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,"Again, to make you understand:"
300,THE FIRST CHRISTMAS APART.,_My darling_!  This is _I!_

305,THE ANGEL JOY.,THE ANGEL JOY.
306,THE ANGEL JOY.,
307,THE ANGEL JOY.,"Oh, was it a death-dream not dreamed through,"
308,THE ANGEL JOY.,That eyed her like a foe?
309,THE ANGEL JOY.,"Or only a sorrow left over from life,"
310,THE ANGEL JOY.,Half-finished years ago?
311,THE ANGEL JOY.,
312,THE ANGEL JOY.,How long was it since she died--who told?
313,THE ANGEL JOY.,Or yet what was death--who knew?
314,THE ANGEL JOY.,"She said: ""I am come to Heaven at last,"
315,THE ANGEL JOY.,"And I 'll do as the blessed do."""
316,THE ANGEL JOY.,
317,THE ANGEL JOY.,"But the custom of earth was stronger than Heaven,"
318,THE ANGEL JOY.,"And the habit of life than death,"
319,THE ANGEL JOY.,How should an anguish as old as thought
320,THE ANGEL JOY.,Be healed by the end of breath?
321,THE ANGEL JOY.,
322,THE ANGEL JOY.,Tissue and nerve and pulse of her soul
323,THE ANGEL JOY.,Had absorbed the disease of woe.
324,THE ANGEL JOY.,The strangest of all the angels there
325,THE ANGEL JOY.,"Was Joy.  (Oh, the wretched know!)"
326,THE ANGEL JOY.,
327,THE ANGEL JOY.,"""I am too tired with earth,"" she said,"
328,THE ANGEL JOY.,"""To rest me in Paradise."
329,THE ANGEL JOY.,"Give me a spot to creep away,"
330,THE ANGEL JOY.,And close my heavy eyes.
331,THE ANGEL JOY.,
332,THE ANGEL JOY.,"""I must learn to be happy in Heaven,"" she said,"
333,THE ANGEL JOY.,"""As we learned to suffer below.""--"
334,THE ANGEL JOY.,"""Our ways are not your ways,"" he said,"
335,THE ANGEL JOY.,"""And ours the ways you go."""
336,THE ANGEL JOY.,
337,THE ANGEL JOY.,"As love, too wise for a word, puts by"
338,THE ANGEL JOY.,"All a woman's weak alarms,"
339,THE ANGEL JOY.,"Joy hushed her lips, and gathered her"
340,THE ANGEL JOY.,Into his mighty arms.
341,THE ANGEL JOY.,
342,THE ANGEL JOY.,"He took her to his holy heart,"
343,THE ANGEL JOY.,And there--for he held her fast--
344,THE ANGEL JOY.,"The saddest spirit in the world,"
345,THE ANGEL JOY.,Came to herself at last.

485,STRONGER THAN DEATH,And still that awful mouth did toss them up:
486,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"""The last is safe!  The last is sound!"""
487,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"We sobbed to see them where they sunk and crawled,"
488,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Like beaten hounds, upon the ground."
489,STRONGER THAN DEATH,
490,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Some sat with lolling, idiot head, and laughed;"
491,STRONGER THAN DEATH,One reached to clutch the air away
492,STRONGER THAN DEATH,His gasping lips refused; some cursed; and one
493,STRONGER THAN DEATH,Knelt down--but he was old--to pray.
494,STRONGER THAN DEATH,
495,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"We huddled there together all that night,"
496,STRONGER THAN DEATH,Women and men from the wild Town;
497,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"I heard a shrill voice cry, ""We all are up,"
498,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"But some--ye have forgot--are down!"""
499,STRONGER THAN DEATH,
500,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"""Who is forgot?""  We stared from face to face;"
501,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"But answering through the dark, she said"
502,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"(It was a woman): ""Eh, ye need not fret;"
503,STRONGER THAN DEATH,None is forgot except the dead.
504,STRONGER THAN DEATH,
505,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"""The buried dead asleep there in the works--"
506,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Eh, Lord!  It must be hot below!"
507,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Ye 'll keep 'em waking all the livelong night,"
508,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"To set the mine a-burning so!"""
509,STRONGER THAN DEATH,
510,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"And all the night the mine did burn and burst,"
511,STRONGER THAN DEATH,As if the earth were but a shell
512,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Through which a child had thrust a finger-touch,"
513,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"And, peal on dreadful peal, the bell,"
514,STRONGER THAN DEATH,
515,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"The miner's 'larum, wrenched the quaking air;"
516,STRONGER THAN DEATH,And through the flaring light we saw
517,STRONGER THAN DEATH,The solid forehead of the eternal hill
518,STRONGER THAN DEATH,Take on a human look of awe;
519,STRONGER THAN DEATH,
520,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"As if it were a living thing, that spoke"
521,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"And flung some protest to the sky,"
522,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"As if it were a dying thing that saw,"
523,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"But could not tell, a mystery."
524,STRONGER THAN DEATH,
525,STRONGER THAN DEATH,The bells ran ringing by us all that night.
526,STRONGER THAN DEATH,The bells ceased jangling with the morn.
527,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"About the blackened works,--sunk, tossed, and rent,--"
528,STRONGER THAN DEATH,We gathered in the foreign dawn;
529,STRONGER THAN DEATH,
530,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Women and men, with eyes askance and strange,"
531,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Fearing, we knew not what, to see."
532,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Against the hollowed jaws of the torn hill,"
533,STRONGER THAN DEATH,Why creep the miners silently?
534,STRONGER THAN DEATH,
535,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"From man to man, a whisper chills: ""See, see,"
536,STRONGER THAN DEATH,The sunken shaft of Thirty-one!
537,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"The earth, a traitor to her trust, has fled"
538,STRONGER THAN DEATH,And turned the dead unto the sun.
539,STRONGER THAN DEATH,
540,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"""And here--O God of life and death!  Thy work,"
541,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Thine only, this!""  With foreheads bare,"
542,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"We knelt, and drew him, young and beautiful,"
543,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Thirty years dead, into the air."
544,STRONGER THAN DEATH,
545,STRONGER THAN DEATH,Thus had he perished; buried from the day;
546,STRONGER THAN DEATH,By the swift poison caught and slain;
547,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"By the kind poison unmarred, rendered fair"
548,STRONGER THAN DEATH,Back to the upper earth again--
549,STRONGER THAN DEATH,
550,STRONGER THAN DEATH,The warm and breathing earth that knew him not;
551,STRONGER THAN DEATH,And men and women wept to see--
552,STRONGER THAN DEATH,For kindred had he none among us all--
553,STRONGER THAN DEATH,How lonely even the dead may be.
554,STRONGER THAN DEATH,
555,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"We wept, I say; we wept who knew him not;"
556,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"But sharp, a tearless woman sprang"
557,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"From out the crowd (that quavering voice I knew),"
558,STRONGER THAN DEATH,And terrible her cry outrang:
559,STRONGER THAN DEATH,
560,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"""I pass, I pass ye all!  Make way!  Stand back!"
561,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Mine is the place ye yield,"" she said."
562,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"""He was my lover once--my own, my own;"
563,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Oh, he was mine, and he is dead!"""
564,STRONGER THAN DEATH,
565,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Women and men, we gave her royal way;"
566,STRONGER THAN DEATH,Proud as young joy the smile she had.
567,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"We knew her for a neighbor in the Town,"
568,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Unmated, solitary, sad."
569,STRONGER THAN DEATH,
570,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Youth, hope, and love, we gave her silent way,"
571,STRONGER THAN DEATH,Calm as a sigh she swept us all;
572,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Then swiftly, as a word leans to a thought,"
573,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"We saw her lean to him, and fall"
574,STRONGER THAN DEATH,
575,STRONGER THAN DEATH,Upon the happy body of the dead--
576,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"An aged woman, poor and gray."
577,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Bright as the day, immortal as young Love,"
578,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"And glorious as life, he lay."
579,STRONGER THAN DEATH,
580,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Her shrunken hands caressed his rounded cheek,"
581,STRONGER THAN DEATH,Her white locks on his golden hair
582,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Fell sadly.  ""O love!"" she cried with shriveled lips,"
583,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"""O love, my love, my own, my fair!"
584,STRONGER THAN DEATH,
585,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"""See, I am old, and all my heart is gray."
586,STRONGER THAN DEATH,They say the dead are aye forgot--
587,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"There, there, my sweet!  I whisper, leaning low,"
588,STRONGER THAN DEATH,That all these women hear it not.
589,STRONGER THAN DEATH,
590,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"""Deep in the darkness there, didst think on me?"
591,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"High in the heavens, have ye been true?"
592,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Since I was young, and since you called me fair,"
593,STRONGER THAN DEATH,I never loved a man but you.
594,STRONGER THAN DEATH,
595,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"And here, my boy, you lie, so safe, so still""--"
596,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"But there she hushed; and in the dim,"
597,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Cool morning, timid as a bride, but calm"
598,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"As a glad mother, gathered him"
599,STRONGER THAN DEATH,
600,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Unto her heart.  And all the people then,"
601,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Women and men, and children too,"
602,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Crept back, and back, and back, and on,"
603,STRONGER THAN DEATH,Still as the morning shadows do.
604,STRONGER THAN DEATH,
605,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"And left them in the lifting dawn--they two,"
606,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"On her sad breast, his shining head"
607,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Stirred softly, as were he the living one,"
608,STRONGER THAN DEATH,And she had been the moveless dead.
609,STRONGER THAN DEATH,
610,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"And yet we crept on, back, and back, and on."
611,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"The distance widened like the sky,"
612,STRONGER THAN DEATH,"Between our little restlessness,"
613,STRONGER THAN DEATH,And Love so godlike that it could not die.
