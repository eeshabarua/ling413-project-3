38,PREFACE,
39,PREFACE,
40,PREFACE,"The art of poetry as practised in the English-speaking countries to-day,"
41,PREFACE,is in a greatly backward state. Among the reading public there are
42,PREFACE,"exactly three opinions generally held about it. The first, and by far"
43,PREFACE,"the most popular, view is that all poets are fools and that poetry is"
44,PREFACE,absurd. The second is that poetry is an agreeable after-dinner
45,PREFACE,"entertainment, and that a poet is great because he has written quotable"
46,PREFACE,lines. The last and worst is that which strives to press the poet into
47,PREFACE,"the service of some philosophical dogma, ism, or fad."
48,PREFACE,
49,PREFACE,"For these views the poets themselves, and no others, are largely"
50,PREFACE,"responsible. With their exaggerated vanity, they have attempted to make"
51,PREFACE,"of their craft a Masonic secret, iterating that a poet composes by ear"
52,PREFACE,"alone; that rhythm is not to be analyzed, that rhyme is sacrosanct; that"
53,PREFACE,"poets, by some special dispensation of Providence, write by inspiration,"
54,PREFACE,being born with more insight than other men; and so forth. Is it any
55,PREFACE,"wonder that the public is indifferent, hostile, or befooled when poets"
56,PREFACE,"themselves disdain to explain clearly what they are trying to do, and"
57,PREFACE,refuse to admit the public into the privacy of their carefully guarded
58,PREFACE,workrooms?
59,PREFACE,
60,PREFACE,"It was Theophile Gautier, I think, who offered to teach any one how to"
61,PREFACE,write poetry in twenty-five lessons. Now this view has in it some
62,PREFACE,"exaggeration, but, at the same time, much truth. No amount of lessoning"
63,PREFACE,"will turn an idiot into a wise man, or enable a man to say something"
64,PREFACE,"when he is naturally one who has nothing to say. Nevertheless, I believe"
65,PREFACE,"that there would have been fewer mute inglorious Miltons, greater"
66,PREFACE,"respect paid to poetry, and many better poets, if the poets themselves"
67,PREFACE,had stopped working through sheer instinct and set themselves the task
68,PREFACE,of considering some elementary principles in their craft. In this
69,PREFACE,"belief, and in the hope of enlightening some one as to the aim and"
70,PREFACE,"purpose of my work, I am writing this preface."
71,PREFACE,
72,PREFACE,"To begin with, the basis of English poetry is rhythm, or, as some would"
73,PREFACE,"prefer to call it, cadence. This rhythm is obtained by mingling stressed"
74,PREFACE,and unstressed syllables. Stress may be produced by accent. It may--and
75,PREFACE,"often is--produced by what is known as quantity, the breath required to"
76,PREFACE,pronounce certain syllables being more than is required on certain
77,PREFACE,"others. However it be produced, it is precisely this insistence upon"
78,PREFACE,"cadence, upon the rhythm of the line when spoken, which sets poetry"
79,PREFACE,"apart from prose, and not--be it said at the outset--a certain way of"
80,PREFACE,"printing, with a capital letter at the beginning of each line, or an"
81,PREFACE,insistence upon end-rhymes.
82,PREFACE,
83,PREFACE,Now this rhythm can be made the same in every line of the poem. This was
84,PREFACE,"the aim of Alexander Pope, for instance. My objection to this method is"
85,PREFACE,that it is both artificial and unmusical. In the case of the eighteenth
86,PREFACE,"century men, it gave the effect of a perfectly balanced pattern, like a"
87,PREFACE,minuet or fugue. In the case of the modern imitator of Kipling or
88,PREFACE,"Masefield, it gives the effect of monotonous rag-time. In neither case"
89,PREFACE,does it offer full scope for emotional development.
90,PREFACE,
91,PREFACE,I maintain that poetry is capable of as many gradations in cadence as
92,PREFACE,music is in time. We can have a rapid group of syllables--what is called
93,PREFACE,"a line--succeeded by a slow heavy one; like the swift, scurrying-up of"
94,PREFACE,the wave and the sullen dragging of itself away. Or we can gradually
95,PREFACE,"increase or decrease our _tempo_, creating _accelerando_ and"
96,PREFACE,_rallentando_ effects. Or we can follow a group of rapid lines with a
97,PREFACE,"group of slow ones, or a single slow, or _vice versa_. Finally, we can"
98,PREFACE,have a perfectly even and unaltered movement throughout if we desire to
99,PREFACE,be monotonous.
100,PREFACE,
101,PREFACE,The good poem is that in which all these effects are properly used to
102,PREFACE,"convey the underlying emotions of its author, and that which welds all"
103,PREFACE,"these emotions into a work of art by the use of dominant _motif_,"
104,PREFACE,"subordinate themes proportionate treatment, repetition, variation,--what"
105,PREFACE,"in music is called development, reversal of roles, and return In short,"
106,PREFACE,"the good poem fixes a free emotion, or a free range of emotions, into an"
107,PREFACE,inevitable and artistic whole. The real secret of the greatest English
108,PREFACE,"poets lies not in their views on life,--which were, naturally, only"
109,PREFACE,"those which every sane man is obliged to hold,--but in their profound"
110,PREFACE,"knowledge of their craft, whereby they were enabled to put forth their"
111,PREFACE,views in perfect form. Each era of man has its unique and self-sufficing
112,PREFACE,"range of expression and experience, and therefore every poet must seek"
113,PREFACE,"anew for himself, out of the language-medium at his disposal, rhythms"
114,PREFACE,which are adequate and forms which are expressive of his own unique
115,PREFACE,personality.
116,PREFACE,
117,PREFACE,"As regards the length of the lines themselves, that depends altogether"
118,PREFACE,"upon the apparatus which Nature has given us, to enable us to breathe"
119,PREFACE,"and to speak. Each line of a poem, however many or few its stresses,"
120,PREFACE,"represents a single breath, and therefore a single perception. The"
121,PREFACE,relation between breath and perception is a commonplace of Oriental
122,PREFACE,"philosophy. As we breathe so do we know the universe, whether by sudden,"
123,PREFACE,"powerful gusts of inspiration, or through the calmer--but rarer--gradual"
124,PREFACE,"ascent into the hidden mysteries of knowledge, and slow falling away"
125,PREFACE,therefrom into darkness.
126,PREFACE,
127,PREFACE,So much for the question of metre. The second range of problems with
128,PREFACE,"which we are immediately concerned, when we examine the poetic craft, is"
129,PREFACE,that which is generally expressed under the name of rhyme.
130,PREFACE,
131,PREFACE,"Now rhyme is undoubtedly an element of poetry, but it is neither an"
132,PREFACE,"indissoluble element, nor is it, in every case, an inevitable one. In"
133,PREFACE,"the main, the instinct which makes for rhyme is sound. Poetry is an art"
134,PREFACE,which demands--though not invariably--the utmost richness and fulness of
135,PREFACE,musical effect. When rhyme is considered as an additional instrument of
136,PREFACE,"what may be called the poetic orchestra, it both loses and gains in"
137,PREFACE,importance. It loses because it becomes of no greater import than
138,PREFACE,"assonance, consonance, alliteration, and a host of similar devices. It"
139,PREFACE,gains because it is used intelligently as a device for adding richness
140,PREFACE,"of effect, instead of blindly as a mere tag at the end of a line."
141,PREFACE,
142,PREFACE,The system which demands that the end of every line of poetry must rhyme
143,PREFACE,"with the end of some one preceding or following it, has not even the"
144,PREFACE,merit of high antiquity or of civilized adherence. In its essence it is
145,PREFACE,"barbarous; it derives from the stamping of feet, clapping of hands,"
146,PREFACE,"pounding of drums, or like devices of savage peoples to mark the rhythms"
147,PREFACE,"in their dances and songs. And its introduction into European poetry, as"
148,PREFACE,"a rule to be invariably followed, dates precisely from the time of the"
149,PREFACE,"break-up of the Latin civilization, and the approach of what the"
150,PREFACE,historians know as the Dark Ages. Since it has come into common use
151,PREFACE,"among European peoples, every poet of eminence has tried to avoid its"
152,PREFACE,"fatiguing monotony, by constructing new stanza-forms. Dante, Petrarch,"
153,PREFACE,"Chaucer, Spenser, all these were innovators or developers of what may be"
154,PREFACE,"known as formal metre. But let us not forget that the greatest of all,"
155,PREFACE,"Shakespeare, used rhyme in his plays, only as additional decoration to"
156,PREFACE,"a lyric, or in a perfectly legitimate fashion as marking the necessary"
157,PREFACE,"pause at the close of a scene. Let us also remember that, as he advanced"
158,PREFACE,"in thought and expression, he gradually abandoned rhyme for the only"
159,PREFACE,reason that an artist abandons anything; because it was no longer
160,PREFACE,adequate.
161,PREFACE,
162,PREFACE,"The process that began with the Pervigilium Veneris, the mediæval"
163,PREFACE,"hymn-writers, and the Provençal troubadours, and which culminated in the"
164,PREFACE,"orchestral blank verse of Shakespeare, has now passed through all the"
165,PREFACE,"stages of reduction to formula, eclecticism, archaistic reaction,"
166,PREFACE,"vulgarization, gramaphone popularity, and death. Milton--Gibbon among"
167,PREFACE,"poets--reduced it to his too-monotonous organ-roll. Dryden, Pope and his"
168,PREFACE,"followers, endlessly repeated a formula. Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge,"
169,PREFACE,attempted a return to the Elizabethan and to the even earlier ballad
170,PREFACE,forms. In the later nineteenth century we come back to still earlier
171,PREFACE,"forms. Ballades, rondeaus, even sestinas appear. Gradually we find the"
172,PREFACE,public attention dropping away from these juggling feats performed with
173,PREFACE,"stale form, and turning to what may be called the new balladist--the"
174,PREFACE,street singer who is content to doggerelize and make strident a once
175,PREFACE,"noble form. We have our Masefields, our Kiplings, and worse. Rag-time"
176,PREFACE,has at last made its appearance in poetry. Let us be grateful to the man
177,PREFACE,who invented it--Nicholas Vachel Lindsay--but let us admit that the
178,PREFACE,force of nature can no further go.
179,PREFACE,
180,PREFACE,It is time to create something new. It is time to strip poetry of
181,PREFACE,"meaningless tatters of form, and to clothe her in new, suitable"
182,PREFACE,garments. Portents and precursors there have been in plenty. We already
183,PREFACE,"have Blake, Matthew Arnold, Whitman, Samuel Butler, and I know not how"
184,PREFACE,"many more. Every one is talking--many poets, poeticules, and poetasters"
185,PREFACE,"are writing--what they call ""free verse."" Let there be no mistake about"
186,PREFACE,"one thing. Free verse that is flabby, in-organic, shapelessly obvious,"
187,PREFACE,is as much of a crime against poetry as the cheapest echo of a Masefield
188,PREFACE,that any doggerel scribbler ever strummed. Let poets drop their
189,PREFACE,"formulas--""free"" or otherwise--and determine to discipline themselves"
190,PREFACE,through experiment. There is much to be learned from the precursors I
191,PREFACE,have mentioned. There is a great deal to be learned from the French
192,PREFACE,"poets--Parnassians, Symbolists, Whitmanites, Fantaisistes--who have, in"
193,PREFACE,"the years 1860 to 1900, created a new Renaissance under our noses. But"
194,PREFACE,"above all, what will teach us the most is our language and life. Never"
195,PREFACE,"was life lived more richly, more fully, with more terrible blind"
196,PREFACE,intensity than it is being lived at this instant. Never was the noble
197,PREFACE,language which is ours surpassed either in richness or in concision. We
198,PREFACE,"have the material with which to work, and the tools to do the work with."
199,PREFACE,It is America's opportunity to lay the foundations for a new flowering
200,PREFACE,"of English verse, and to lay them as broad as they are strong."

246,I,The spattering of the rain upon pale terraces
247,I,Of afternoon is like the passing of a dream
248,I,Amid the roses shuddering 'gainst the wet green stalks
249,I,Of the streaming trees--the passing of the wind
250,I,Upon the pale lower terraces of my dream
251,I,Is like the crinkling of the wet grey robes
252,I,Of the hours that come to turn over the urn
253,I,Of the day and spill its rainy dream.
254,I,Vague movement over the puddled terraces:
255,I,Heavy gold pennons--a pomp of solemn gardens
256,I,Half hidden under the liquid veil of spring:
257,I,Far trumpets like a vague rout of faded roses
258,I,Burst 'gainst the wet green silence of distant forests:
259,I,A clash of cymbals--then the swift swaying footsteps
260,I,Of the wind that undulates along the languid terraces.
261,I,Pools of rain--the vacant terraces
262,I,"Wet, chill and glistening"

271,II,Softly.
272,II,
273,II,I am afraid to traverse the long still streets of evening;
274,II,For I fear to see the ghosts that stare at me
275,II,From the shadows.
276,II,I will stay indoors instead and await my wandering dream.
277,II,
278,II,"She is about me, fluid yet, and formless;"
279,II,The wind in her hair whispers like dim violins:
280,II,And the faint glint of her eyes shifts like a sudden movement
281,II,Over the surface of a dark pool.
282,II,
283,II,"She comes to me slowly down the lost streets of the evening,"
284,II,And their immutable silence is in her feet.
285,II,"Let no lamps flare--be still, my heart--hands, stay:"

294,III,Crawling slowly down the low reaches
295,III,Of the river.
296,III,About the keel there is a bubbling and gurgling
297,III,Of grumpy water;
298,III,"And as the prow noses out a way for itself,"
299,III,"It seems to weave a dream of bubbles and flashing foam,"
300,III,A dream of strange islands whereto it is bound:
301,III,Pear-islands drenched with the dawn.
302,III,"The palms flash under the immense dark sky,"
303,III,Down which the sun dives to embrace the earth:
304,III,"Drums boom and conches bray,"
305,III,And with a crash of crimson cymbals
306,III,Suddenly appears above the polished backs of slaves
307,III,A king in a breastplate of gold
308,III,Gigantic
309,III,Amid tossed roses and swaying dancers
310,III,That melt into pale undulations and muffled echoes

458,XII,"Golden flowers with pollen-dusty cups,"
459,XII,Flowers of silence. Heed not though eve
460,XII,"Should sail, a grey swan, in the pool of the sky,"
461,XII,Spreading low ripples. Heed these not!
462,XII,Only awake when slim twilight
463,XII,Plunges her body in the last blown spray of the sun!
464,XII,"Awake, then, for twilight and dawn are your day:"
465,XII,"Therefore lie down in the long dim grass and sleep,"
466,XII,And I will blow my low pipes over you.

470,XIII,
471,XIII,As I went through the city by day
472,XIII,I saw shadows in sunlight:
473,XIII,But in the night I saw everywhere
474,XIII,Stars within the darkness.
475,XIII,
476,XIII,(A coldly fluting breeze:
477,XIII,Dark Pan under the trees.
478,XIII,Low laughter: up the sky
479,XIII,A star like a street-lamp left on high.)
480,XIII,
481,XIII,As I went through the city by day
482,XIII,I was hustled by jostling people.
483,XIII,"But in the night, the wind of the darkness"
484,XIII,"Whispered, ""Hush!"" to my soul."
485,XIII,
486,XIII,
487,XIV,XIV
488,XIV,
489,XIV,"Brown bed of earth, still fresh and warm with love,"
490,XIV,Now hold me tight:
491,XIV,"Broad field of sky, where the clouds laughing move,"
492,XIV,Fill up my pores with light:
493,XIV,"You trees, now talk to me, chatter and scold or weep,"
494,XIV,Or drowsing stand:
495,XIV,"You winds, now play with me, you wild things creep,"
496,XIV,"You boulders, bruise my hand!"
497,XIV,I now am yours and you are mine: it matters not
498,XIV,What Gods herein I see:
499,XIV,"You grow in me, I am rooted to this spot,"
500,XIV,"We drink and pass the cup, immortally."
501,XIV,
502,XIV,
503,XV,XV
504,XV,
505,XV,"O seeded grass, you army of little men"
506,XV,"Crawling up the long slope with quivering, quick blades of steel:"
507,XV,"You who storm millions of graves, tiny green tentacles of Earth,"
508,XV,"Interlace yourselves tightly over my heart,"
509,XV,And do not let me go:
510,XV,For I would lie here forever and watch with one eye
511,XV,"The pilgrimaging ants in your dull, savage jungles,"
512,XV,The while with the other I see the stiff lines of the slope
513,XV,"Break in mid-air, a wave surprisingly arrested,"
514,XV,"And above them, wavering, dancing, bodiless, colourless, unreal,"
515,XV,The long thin lazy fingers of the heat.
516,XV,
517,XV,
518,XVI,XVI
519,XVI,
520,XVI,"An ant crawling up a grass-blade,"
521,XVI,"And above it, the sky."
522,XVI,I shall remember these when I die:
523,XVI,An ant and a butterfly
524,XVI,And the sky.
525,XVI,
526,XVI,The grass is full of forget-me-nots and poppies:
527,XVI,Through the air darts many a fly.
528,XVI,"The ant toils up its grass-blade,"
529,XVI,The careless hours go by.
530,XVI,
531,XVI,The grass-blades bow to the feet of the lazy hours:
532,XVI,"They walk out of the wood, showering shadows on flowers."
533,XVI,Their robes flutter vaguely far off there in the clearing:
534,XVI,I see them sometimes from the corner of my eye.
535,XVI,
536,XVI,
537,XVII,XVII
538,XVII,
539,XVII,The wind that drives the fine dry sand
540,XVII,Across the strand:
541,XVII,The sad wind spinning arabesques
542,XVII,With a wrinkled hand.
543,XVII,
544,XVII,"Labyrinths of shifting sand,"
545,XVII,The dancing dunes!
546,XVII,
547,XVII,"I will arise and run with the sand,"
548,XVII,And gather it greedily in my hand:
549,XVII,I will wriggle like a long yellow snake over the beaches.
550,XVII,"I will lie curled up, sleeping,"
551,XVII,And the wind shall chase me
552,XVII,Far inland.
553,XVII,
554,XVII,My breath is the music of the mad wind;
555,XVII,"Shrill piping, stamping of drunken feet,"
556,XVII,"The fluttering, tattered broidery flung"
557,XVII,Over the dunes' steep escarpments.
558,XVII,
559,XVII,The fine dry sand that whistles
560,XVII,Down the long low beaches.
561,XVII,
562,XVII,
563,XVIII,XVIII
564,XVIII,
565,XVIII,"Blue, brown, blue: sky, sand, sea:"
566,XVIII,I swell to your immensity.
567,XVIII,"I will run over the endless beach,"
568,XVIII,"I will shout to the breaking spray,"
569,XVIII,I will touch the sky with my fingers.
570,XVIII,My happiness is like this sand:
571,XVIII,I let it run out of my hand.
572,XVIII,
573,XVIII,
574,XIX,XIX
575,XIX,
576,XIX,The clouds pass
577,XIX,Over the polished mirror of the sky:
578,XIX,"The clouds pass, puffs of grey,"
579,XIX,There is no star.
580,XIX,
581,XIX,The clouds pass slowly:
582,XIX,Suddenly a disengaged star flashes.
583,XIX,The night is cold and the clouds
584,XIX,Roll slowly over the sky.
585,XIX,
586,XIX,
587,XX,XX
588,XX,
589,XX,I dance:
590,XX,I exist in motion:
591,XX,A wind-shaken flower spilling my drops in the sunlight.
592,XX,
593,XX,"I feel the muscles bending, relaxing beneath me;"
594,XX,I direct the rippling sweep of the lines of my body;
595,XX,"Its impact crashes through the thin walls of the atmosphere,"
596,XX,I dance.
597,XX,
598,XX,About me whirls
599,XX,"The sombre hall, the gaudy stage, the harsh glare of the footlights,"
600,XX,And in the brains of thousands watching
601,XX,Little flames leap quivering to the music of my effort.
602,XX,
603,XX,I have danced:
604,XX,I have expressed my soul
605,XX,"In unbroken rhythm,"
606,XX,"Sorrow, and flame."
607,XX,I am tired: I would be extinguished beneath your beating hands.
608,XX,
609,XX,
610,XXI,XXI
611,XXI,
612,XXI,"Not noisily, but solemnly and pale,"
613,XXI,In a meditative ecstasy you entered life:
614,XXI,"As performing some strange rite, to which you alone held the clue."
615,XXI,"Child, life did not give rude strength to you;"
616,XXI,"from the beginning, you would seem to have thrown away,"
617,XXI,"As something cold and cumbersome, that armour men use against death."
618,XXI,"You would perhaps look on him face to face, and so learn the secret"
619,XXI,Whether that face wears oftenest a smile or no?
620,XXI,"Strange, old, and silent being, there is something"
621,XXI,Infinitely vast in your intense tininess:
622,XXI,"I think you could point out, with a smile, some curious star"
623,XXI,"Far off in the heavens, which no man has seen before."
624,XXI,
625,XXI,
626,XXII,XXII
627,XXII,
628,XXII,The morning is clean and blue and the wind blows up the clouds:
629,XXII,Now my thoughts gathered from afar
630,XXII,"Once again in their patched armour, with rusty plumes and blunted swords,"
631,XXII,Move out to war.
632,XXII,
633,XXII,Smoking our morning pipes we shall ride two and two
634,XXII,Through the woods.
635,XXII,"For our old cause keeps us together,"
636,XXII,And our hatred is so precious not death or defeat can break it.
637,XXII,
638,XXII,"God willing, we shall this day meet that old enemy"
639,XXII,Who has given us so many a good beating.
640,XXII,"Thank God we have a cause worth fighting for,"
641,XXII,And a cause worth losing and a good song to sing.
642,XXII,
643,XXII,
644,XXIII,XXIII
645,XXIII,
646,XXIII,Torridly the moon rolls upward
647,XXIII,"Against the smooth immensity of midsummer sky,"
648,XXIII,"Changeless, inexhaustible:"
649,XXIII,The city beneath is still:
650,XXIII,"Heaven and Earth are clasped together,"
651,XXIII,Momently life grows as careless
652,XXIII,As the life of the intense stars.
653,XXIII,"Out of the houses climbing,"
654,XXIII,"Fuming up windows, flickering from every roof-top,"
655,XXIII,"Rigid on sonorous pinnacles,"
656,XXIII,Silently swirl aloft
657,XXIII,Love's infinite flamelets.
658,XXIII,
659,XXIII,
660,XXIV,XXIV
661,XXIV,
662,XXIV,"O all you stars up yonder,"
663,XXIV,"Do you hear me? Beautiful, winking, sullen eyes,"
664,XXIV,"I am tired of seeing you in the same old places,"
665,XXIV,Night after night in the sky.
666,XXIV,"I hoped you would dance--but after twenty-six years,"
667,XXIV,I find you are determined to stay as you are.
668,XXIV,"So I make it known to you, stars clustered or solitary,"
669,XXIV,That I want you to fall into my lap to-night.
670,XXIV,"Come down, little stars, let me play with you:"
671,XXIV,"I will string you like beads, and shovel you together,"
672,XXIV,"And wear you in my ears, and scatter you over people--"
673,XXIV,"And toss you back, like apples, if I choose."
674,XXIV,
675,XXIV,
676,XXV,XXV
677,XXV,
678,XXV,"As I wandered over the city through the night,"
679,XXV,I saw many strange things:
680,XXV,But I have forgotten all
681,XXV,Except one painted face.
682,XXV,"Gaudy, shameless night-orchid,"
683,XXV,"Heavy, flushed, sticky with narcotic perfume,"
684,XXV,There was something in you which made me prefer you
685,XXV,Above all the feeble forget-me-nots of the world.
686,XXV,"You were neither burnt out nor pallid,"
687,XXV,"There was plain, coarse, vulgar meaning in every line of you"
688,XXV,And no make-believe:
689,XXV,"You were at least alive,"
690,XXV,When all the rest were but puppets of the night.
691,XXV,
692,XXV,
693,XXVI,XXVI
694,XXVI,
695,XXVI,"Slowly along the lamp-emblazoned street,"
696,XXVI,Amid the last sad drifting crowds of midnight
697,XXVI,"Like lost souls wandering,"
698,XXVI,Comes marching by solemnly
699,XXVI,"As for some gem-bedecked ritual of old,"
700,XXVI,A monotonous procession of black carts
701,XXVI,Full crowded with blood-red blossom:
702,XXVI,Scarlet geraniums
703,XXVI,Unfolding their fiery globes upon the night.
704,XXVI,These are the memories of day moulded in jagged flame:
705,XXVI,"Lust, joy, blood, and death."
706,XXVI,"With crushed hands, weary eyes, and hoarse clamour,"
707,XXVI,We consecrate and acclaim them tumultuously
708,XXVI,"Ere they pass, contemptuous, beyond the unpierced veil of silence."
709,XXVI,
710,XXVI,
711,XXVII,XXVII
712,XXVII,
713,XXVII,"I think there was an hour in which God laughed at me,"
714,XXVII,"For as I passed along the street,"
715,XXVII,saw that all the women--although their bodies were dexterously concealed--
716,XXVII,Were thinking with all their might what men were like:
717,XXVII,"And the men, mechanically correct, cigars at lips,"
718,XXVII,"Were wanting to rush at the women,"
719,XXVII,"But were restrained by respectability or timidity,"
720,XXVII,Or fear of the consequences or vanity or some puerile dream
721,XXVII,Of a pale ideal lost in the vast grey sky.
722,XXVII,"So I said to myself, it is time to end all this:"
723,XXVII,I will take the first woman that comes along.
724,XXVII,And then God laughed at me--and I too smiled
725,XXVII,To see that He was in such good humour and that the sun was shining.

728,XXVIII,XXVIII
729,XXVIII,
730,XXVIII,"I remember, there was a day"
731,XXVIII,During which I did not write a line of verse:
732,XXVIII,"Nor did I speak a word to any woman,"
733,XXVIII,Nor did I meet with death.
734,XXVIII,
735,XXVIII,Yet all that day I was fully occupied:
736,XXVIII,"My eyes saw trees, clouds, streets, houses, people;"
737,XXVIII,My lungs breathed air;
738,XXVIII,My mouth swallowed food and drink;
739,XXVIII,"My hands seized things, my feet touched earth,"
740,XXVIII,Or spurned it at my desire.
741,XXVIII,
742,XXVIII,"On that day I know I would have been sufficiently happy,"
743,XXVIII,If I could have kept my brain from bothering at all
744,XXVIII,About my next trite poem;
745,XXVIII,About the tedious necessities of sex;
746,XXVIII,And about the day on which I would at last meet death.

754,XXIX,"Indefatigable, after all these years!"
755,XXIX,"Here upon earth there is life, and then death,"
756,XXIX,"Dawn, and later nightfall,"
757,XXIX,"Fire, and the quenching of embers:"
758,XXIX,But why should I not remember that my night is dawn in another part of
759,XXIX,"the world,"
760,XXIX,If the idea fits my fancy?
761,XXIX,"Dawns of marvellous light, wakeful, sleepy, weary, dancing dawns,"
762,XXIX,You are rose petals settling through the blue of my evening:
763,XXIX,"I light my pipe to salute you,"
764,XXIX,And sit puffing smoke in the air and never say a word.

769,XXX,"I have seemed often feeble and useless to myself,"
770,XXX,And many times I have wished that the tedium of my life
771,XXX,Lay at last dissolved in the cold acid of death:
772,XXX,Yet I have not forgotten
773,XXX,"The sparkling of waters in the sunlight,"
774,XXX,"The sound of a woman's voice,"
775,XXX,"Gliding dancers,"
776,XXX,"Chanting worshippers,"
777,XXX,"A child crying,"
778,XXX,The wind amid the hills.
779,XXX,"These I can remember,"
780,XXX,And I think they are more of me

784,XXXI,XXXI

786,XXXI,My stiff-spread arms

789,XXXI,My hands drag it upwards:
790,XXXI,Thus I create the dance.
791,XXXI,
792,XXXI,I drink of the red bowl of the sunlight:
793,XXXI,I swim through seas of rain:
794,XXXI,I dig my toes into earth:
795,XXXI,I taste the smack of the wind:
796,XXXI,I am myself:
797,XXXI,I live.
798,XXXI,
799,XXXI,The temples of the gods are forgotten or in ruins:
800,XXXI,Professors are still arguing about the past and the future:
801,XXXI,"I am sick of reading marginal notes on life,"
802,XXXI,I am weary of following false banners:
803,XXXI,I desire nothing more intensely or completely than this present;
804,XXXI,There is nothing about me you are more likely to notice than my being:
805,XXXI,"Let me therefore rejoice silently,"
806,XXXI,A golden butterfly glancing against an unflecked wall.

813,XXXII,This I would not barter for any kingdom.
814,XXXII,
815,XXXII,"I am a wheeling swallow,"
816,XXXII,Blue all over is my delight.
817,XXXII,I am a drowsy grass-blade
818,XXXII,In the greenest shadow.

824,XXXIII,"My ribs are a hollow grating, my hair is coarse and hard,"
825,XXXIII,"My flanks are like sharp iron wedges, my eyes glitter as chill glass;"
826,XXXIII,"Down below there are the meadows where my famished hopes are feeding,"
827,XXXIII,"I will waylay them to windward, stalking in watchful patience,"
828,XXXIII,"I will pounce upon them, plunging my muzzle in the hot spurt of their"
829,XXXIII,blood.

837,XXXIV,"Below it a tumult of music,"
838,XXXIV,"Above it the streaming wastes of the sky,"
839,XXXIV,"Pinnacles of clouds, pyres of dawn,"
840,XXXIV,"Infinite effort, everlasting day."
841,XXXIV,The immense flag waving
842,XXXIV,Aloft in glory:
843,XXXIV,Over seas and hilltops
844,XXXIV,Transmitting its lightnings.

861,XXXVI,"Into the dull-blue smouldering gulf of a lake below,"
862,XXXVI,"Landlocked amid the mountains, so my soul"
863,XXXVI,Was a gorge that was filled with the warring echoes of song.
864,XXXVI,
865,XXXVI,"Of old, they wore"
866,XXXVI,"Shining armour, and banners of broad gold they bore:"
867,XXXVI,"Now they drift, like a wild bird's cry,"
868,XXXVI,Downwards from chill summits of the sky.
869,XXXVI,Fountains of flashing joy were their source afar;
870,XXXVI,"Now they lie still, to mirror every star."
871,XXXVI,"In circles of opal, ruby, blue, out-thrown,"
872,XXXVI,"They drift down to a dull, dark monotone."
873,XXXVI,
874,XXXVI,"Pluck the loose strings, singer,"
875,XXXVI,Thrum the strings;
876,XXXVI,"For the wind brings distant, drowsy bells of song."
877,XXXVI,"Loose the plucked string, poet,"
878,XXXVI,"Spurn the strings,"
879,XXXVI,For the echoes of memory float through the gulf for long.
880,XXXVI,
881,XXXVI,My songs seem now one humming note afar:
882,XXXVI,"Light as ether, quivering 'twixt star and star,"
883,XXXVI,"But yet, so still"
884,XXXVI,"I know not whence they come, if mine they are."
885,XXXVI,Yet that low note
886,XXXVI,"Increases in force as if it said, ""I will"":"
887,XXXVI,"Kindled by God's fierce breath, it would the whole world fill."
888,XXXVI,"Till steadily outwards thrown,"
889,XXXVI,"By trumpets blazoned, from the sky downblown,"
890,XXXVI,"It grows a vast march, massive, monotonous, known"
891,XXXVI,Of old gold trumpeteers
892,XXXVI,Through infinite years:
893,XXXVI,"Bursting the white, thronged vaults of the cool sky."
894,XXXVI,Till hurtling down there falls one mad black hammer-blow:
895,XXXVI,Then the chained echoes in their maniac woe
896,XXXVI,"Are loosed against the silence, to shriek uncannily."
897,XXXVI,
898,XXXVI,"The strings shiver faintly, poet:"
899,XXXVI,"Strike the strings,"
900,XXXVI,Speed the song:
901,XXXVI,"Tremulous upward rush of wheeling, whirling wings."

909,EPILOGUE,And they are mad ever after and go with blind eyes
910,EPILOGUE,Nosing hungrily in the gutter for the scraps that men throw to the dogs;
911,EPILOGUE,Few heed their babblings.
