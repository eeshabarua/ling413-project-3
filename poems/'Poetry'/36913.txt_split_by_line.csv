147,THE DIVINE VISION,"This mood hath known all beauty, for it sees"
148,THE DIVINE VISION,O'erwhelmed majesties
149,THE DIVINE VISION,"In these pale forms, and kingly crowns of gold"
150,THE DIVINE VISION,"On brows no longer bold,"
151,THE DIVINE VISION,And through the shadowy terrors of their hell
152,THE DIVINE VISION,The love for which they fell.
153,THE DIVINE VISION,And how desire which cast them in the deep
154,THE DIVINE VISION,Called God too from His sleep.
155,THE DIVINE VISION,"Oh, pity, only seer, who looking through"
156,THE DIVINE VISION,"A heart melted like dew,"
157,THE DIVINE VISION,"Seest the long perished in the present thus,"
158,THE DIVINE VISION,For ever dwell in us.
159,THE DIVINE VISION,Whatever time thy golden eyelids ope
160,THE DIVINE VISION,They travel to a hope;
161,THE DIVINE VISION,Not only backward from these low degrees
162,THE DIVINE VISION,"To starry dynasties,"
163,THE DIVINE VISION,"But, looking far where now the silence owns"
164,THE DIVINE VISION,"And rules from empty thrones,"
165,THE DIVINE VISION,Thou seest the enchanted hills of heaven burn
166,THE DIVINE VISION,For joy at our return.
167,THE DIVINE VISION,Thy tender kiss hath memory we are kings
168,THE DIVINE VISION,For all our wanderings.
169,THE DIVINE VISION,Thy shining eyes already see the after
170,THE DIVINE VISION,In hidden light and laughter.

176,THE GATES OF DREAMLAND,
177,THE GATES OF DREAMLAND,"It's a lonely road through bogland to the lake at Carrowmore,"
178,THE GATES OF DREAMLAND,And a sleeper there lies dreaming where the water laps the shore;
179,THE GATES OF DREAMLAND,"Though the moth-wings of the twilight in their purples are unfurled,"
180,THE GATES OF DREAMLAND,Yet his sleep is filled with music by the masters of the world.
181,THE GATES OF DREAMLAND,
182,THE GATES OF DREAMLAND,There's a hand is white as silver that is fondling with his hair:
183,THE GATES OF DREAMLAND,There are glimmering feet of sunshine that are dancing by him there:
184,THE GATES OF DREAMLAND,And half-open lips of faery that were dyed a faery red
185,THE GATES OF DREAMLAND,In their revels where the Hazel Tree its holy clusters shed.
186,THE GATES OF DREAMLAND,
187,THE GATES OF DREAMLAND,"""Come away,"" the red lips whisper, ""all the world is weary now;"
188,THE GATES OF DREAMLAND,'Tis the twilight of the ages and it's time to quit the plough.
189,THE GATES OF DREAMLAND,"Oh, the very sunlight's weary ere it lightens up the dew,"
190,THE GATES OF DREAMLAND,And its gold is changed and faded before it falls to you.
191,THE GATES OF DREAMLAND,
192,THE GATES OF DREAMLAND,"""Though your colleen's heart be tender, a tenderer heart is near."
193,THE GATES OF DREAMLAND,What's the starlight in her glances when the stars are shining clear?
194,THE GATES OF DREAMLAND,Who would kiss the fading shadow when the flower-face glows above?
195,THE GATES OF DREAMLAND,"'Tis the Beauty of all Beauty that is calling for your love."""
196,THE GATES OF DREAMLAND,
197,THE GATES OF DREAMLAND,"Oh, the great gates of the mountain have opened once again,"
198,THE GATES OF DREAMLAND,"And the sound of song and dancing falls upon the ears of men,"
199,THE GATES OF DREAMLAND,"And the Land of Youth lies gleaming flushed with rainbow light and mirth,"
200,THE GATES OF DREAMLAND,And the old enchantment lingers in the honey-heart of earth.

211,FREEDOM,
212,FREEDOM,"I love the free in thee, my bird,"
213,FREEDOM,The lure of freedom drew;
214,FREEDOM,"The light you fly toward, my bird,"
215,FREEDOM,I fly with thee unto.
216,FREEDOM,
217,FREEDOM,"And there we yet will meet, my bird,"

226,THE MASTER SINGER,
227,THE MASTER SINGER,"A laughter in the diamond air, a music in the trembling grass;"
228,THE MASTER SINGER,And one by one the words of light as joydrops through my being pass:
229,THE MASTER SINGER,"""I am the sunlight in the heart, the silver moon-glow in the mind;"
230,THE MASTER SINGER,My laughter runs and ripples through the wavy tresses of the wind.
231,THE MASTER SINGER,"I am the fire upon the hills, the dancing flame that leads afar"
232,THE MASTER SINGER,"Each burning hearted wanderer, and I the dear and homeward star."
233,THE MASTER SINGER,"A myriad lovers died for me, and in their latest yielded breath"
234,THE MASTER SINGER,I woke in glory giving them immortal life though touched by death.
235,THE MASTER SINGER,"They knew me from the dawn of time: if Hermes beats his rainbow wings,"
236,THE MASTER SINGER,"If Angus shakes his locks of light, or golden-haired Apollo sings,"
237,THE MASTER SINGER,"It matters not the name, the land: my joy in all the Gods abides:"
238,THE MASTER SINGER,Even in the cricket in the grass some dimness of me smiles and hides.
239,THE MASTER SINGER,"For joy of me the daystar glows, and in delight and wild desire"
240,THE MASTER SINGER,"The peacock twilight rays aloft its plumes and blooms of shadowy fire,"
241,THE MASTER SINGER,"Where in the vastness too I burn through summer nights and ages long,"
242,THE MASTER SINGER,"And with the fiery-footed watchers shake in myriad dance and song."""

249,REMEMBRANCE,"There were many burning hours on the heart-sweet tide,"
250,REMEMBRANCE,"And we passed away from ourselves, forgetting all"
251,REMEMBRANCE,"The immortal moods that faded, the god who died,"
252,REMEMBRANCE,Hastening away to the King on a distant call.
253,REMEMBRANCE,
254,REMEMBRANCE,"There were ruby dews were shed when the heart was riven,"
255,REMEMBRANCE,And passionate pleading and prayers to the dead we had wronged;
256,REMEMBRANCE,"And we passed away, unremembering and unforgiven,"
257,REMEMBRANCE,Hastening away to the King for the peace we longed.
258,REMEMBRANCE,
259,REMEMBRANCE,"Love unremembered and heart-ache we left behind,"
260,REMEMBRANCE,"We forsook them, unheeding, hastening away in our flight;"
261,REMEMBRANCE,We knew the hearts we had wronged of old we would find
262,REMEMBRANCE,When we came to the fold of the King for rest in the night.

271,DANA,And inaccessible in dewy eyes
272,DANA,"I dwell, and all unkissed on lovely lips,"
273,DANA,"Lingering between white breasts inviolate,"
274,DANA,"And fleeting ever from the passionate touch,"
275,DANA,"I shine afar, till men may not divine"
276,DANA,Whether it is the stars or the beloved
277,DANA,They follow with rapt spirit.  And I weave
278,DANA,"My spells at evening, folding with dim caress,"
279,DANA,"Aerial arms and twilight dropping hair,"
280,DANA,"The lonely wanderer by wood or shore,"
281,DANA,"Till, filled with some deep tenderness, he yields,"
282,DANA,Feeling in dreams for the dear mother heart
283,DANA,"He knew, ere he forsook the starry way,"
284,DANA,"And clings there, pillowed far above the smoke"
285,DANA,And the dim murmur from the duns of men.
286,DANA,"I can enchant the trees and rocks, and fill"
287,DANA,"The dumb brown lips of earth with mystery,"
288,DANA,Make them reveal or hide the god.  I breathe
289,DANA,"A deeper pity than all love, myself"
290,DANA,"Mother of all, but without hands to heal:"
291,DANA,"Too vast and vague, they know me not.  But yet,"
292,DANA,"I am the heartbreak over fallen things,"
293,DANA,"The sudden gentleness that stays the blow,"
294,DANA,And I am in the kiss that foemen give
295,DANA,"Pausing in battle, and in the tears that fall"
296,DANA,"Over the vanquished foe, and in the highest,"
297,DANA,"Among the Danaan gods, I am the last"
298,DANA,Council of mercy in their hearts where they
299,DANA,Mete justice from a thousand starry thrones.

305,THE GREY EROS,
306,THE GREY EROS,We are desert leagues apart;
307,THE GREY EROS,Time is misty ages now
308,THE GREY EROS,Since the warmth of heart to heart
309,THE GREY EROS,Chased the shadows from my brow.
310,THE GREY EROS,
311,THE GREY EROS,"Oh, I am so old, meseems"
312,THE GREY EROS,"I am next of kin to Time,"
313,THE GREY EROS,The historian of her dreams
314,THE GREY EROS,From the long-forgotten prime.
315,THE GREY EROS,
316,THE GREY EROS,You have come a path of flowers.
317,THE GREY EROS,What a way was mine to roam!
318,THE GREY EROS,"Many a fallen empire's towers,"
319,THE GREY EROS,Many a ruined heart my home.
320,THE GREY EROS,
321,THE GREY EROS,"No, there is no comfort, none."
322,THE GREY EROS,All the dewy tender breath
323,THE GREY EROS,Idly falls when life is done
324,THE GREY EROS,On the starless brow of death.
325,THE GREY EROS,
326,THE GREY EROS,"Though the dream of love may tire,"
327,THE GREY EROS,In the ages long agone
328,THE GREY EROS,There were ruby hearts of fire--
329,THE GREY EROS,"Ah, the daughters of the dawn!"
330,THE GREY EROS,
331,THE GREY EROS,"Though I am so feeble now,"
332,THE GREY EROS,I remember when our pride
333,THE GREY EROS,Could not to the Mighty bow;
334,THE GREY EROS,We would sweep His stars aside.
335,THE GREY EROS,
336,THE GREY EROS,Mix thy youth with thoughts like those--
337,THE GREY EROS,"It were but to wither thee,"
338,THE GREY EROS,But to graft the youthful rose
339,THE GREY EROS,On the old and flowerless tree.
340,THE GREY EROS,
341,THE GREY EROS,Age is no more near than youth
342,THE GREY EROS,To the sceptre and the crown.
343,THE GREY EROS,"Vain the wisdom, vain the truth;"
344,THE GREY EROS,Do not lay thy rapture down.

359,REST,On the wild music of the day.
360,REST,
361,REST,"But sometimes when your wings would rest,"
362,REST,And winds are laid on quiet eves:

364,REST,And lap you close with loving leaves.

370,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,
371,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,A cabin on the mountain side hid in a grassy nook
372,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,Where door and windows open wide that friendly stars may look.
373,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,"The rabbit shy can patter in, the winds may enter free,"
374,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,Who throng around the mountain throne in living ecstasy.
375,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,
376,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,"And when the sun sets dimmed in eve and purple fills the air,"
377,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,I think the sacred Hazel Tree is dropping berries there
378,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,From starry fruitage waved aloft where Connla's Well o'erflows;
379,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,For sure the enchanted waters run through every wind that blows.
380,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,
381,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,"I think when night towers up aloft and shakes the trembling dew,"
382,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,How every high and lonely thought that thrills my being through
383,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,"Is but a ruddy berry dropped down through the purple air,"
384,THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE,And from the magic tree of life the fruit falls everywhere.

392,THE BURNING GLASS,"And melts and maddens all my blood,"
393,THE BURNING GLASS,From out thy spirit flashes through
394,THE BURNING GLASS,The burning glass of womanhood.
395,THE BURNING GLASS,
396,THE BURNING GLASS,Only so far; here must I stay:
397,THE BURNING GLASS,"Nearer I miss the light, the fire;"
398,THE BURNING GLASS,"I must endure the torturing ray,"
399,THE BURNING GLASS,"And with all beauty, all desire."
400,THE BURNING GLASS,
401,THE BURNING GLASS,"Ah, time long must the effort be,"
402,THE BURNING GLASS,And far the way that I must go
403,THE BURNING GLASS,"To bring my spirit unto thee,"
404,THE BURNING GLASS,"Behind the glass, within the glow."

409,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH
410,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,
411,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,The wonder of the world is o'er:
412,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,The magic from the sea is gone:
413,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,"There is no unimagined shore,"
414,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,No islet yet to venture on.
415,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,"The Sacred Hazels' blooms are shed,"
416,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,The Nuts of Knowledge harvested.
417,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,
418,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,"Oh, what is worth this lore of age"
419,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,If time shall never bring us back
420,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,Our battle with the gods to wage
421,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,Reeling along the starry track.
422,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,The battle rapture here goes by
423,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,In warring upon things that die.
424,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,
425,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,Let be the tale of him whose love
426,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,"Was sighed between white Deirdre's breasts,"
427,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,It will not lift the heart above
428,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,The sodden clay on which it rests.
429,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,Love once had power the gods to bring
430,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,All rapt on its wild wandering.
431,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,
432,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,"We shiver in the falling dew,"
433,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,And seek a shelter from the storm:
434,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,When man these elder brothers knew
435,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,"He found the mother nature warm,"
436,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,"A hearth fire blazing through it all,"
437,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,A home without a circling wall.
438,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,
439,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,"We dwindle down beneath the skies,"
440,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,And from ourselves we pass away:
441,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,The paradise of memories
442,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,Grows ever fainter day by day.
443,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,"The shepherd stars have shrunk within,"
444,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,The world's great night will soon begin.
445,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,
446,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,"Will no one, ere it is too late,"
447,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,"Ere fades the last memorial gleam,"
448,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,Recall for us our earlier state?
449,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,For nothing but so vast a dream
450,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,That it would scale the steeps of air
451,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,Could rouse us from so vast despair.
452,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,
453,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,The power is ours to make or mar
454,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,"Our fate as on the earliest morn,"
455,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,The Darkness and the Radiance are
456,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,Creatures within the spirit born.
457,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,"Yet, bathed in gloom too long, we might"
458,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,Forget how we imagined light.
459,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,
460,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,Not yet are fixed the prison bars;
461,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,The hidden light the spirit owns
462,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,If blown to flame would dim the stars
463,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,And they who rule them from their thrones:
464,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,And the proud sceptred spirits thence
465,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,Would bow to pay us reverence.
466,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,
467,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,"Oh, while the glory sinks within"
468,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,"Let us not wait on earth behind,"
469,THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH,"But follow where it flies, and win"

1073,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Seeking remoter valleys long hath gone,"
1074,A SUMMER NIGHT,Not yet hath come her sister of the dawn.
1075,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Silence and coolness now the earth enfold,"
1076,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Jewels of glittering green, long mists of gold,"
1077,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Hazes of nebulous silver veil the height,"
1078,A SUMMER NIGHT,And shake in tremors through the shadowy night.
1079,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Heard through the stillness, as in whispered words,"
1080,A SUMMER NIGHT,The wandering God-guided wings of birds
1081,A SUMMER NIGHT,Ruffle the dark.  The little lives that lie
1082,A SUMMER NIGHT,Deep hid in grass join in a long-drawn sigh
1083,A SUMMER NIGHT,More softly still; and unheard through the blue
1084,A SUMMER NIGHT,"The falling of innumerable dew,"
1085,A SUMMER NIGHT,Lifts with grey fingers all the leaves that lay
1086,A SUMMER NIGHT,Burned in the heat of the consuming day.
1087,A SUMMER NIGHT,"The lawns and lakes lie in this night of love,"
1088,A SUMMER NIGHT,Admitted to the majesty above.
1089,A SUMMER NIGHT,Earth with the starry company hath part;
1090,A SUMMER NIGHT,"The waters hold all heaven within their heart,"
1091,A SUMMER NIGHT,And glimmer o'er with wave-lips everywhere
1092,A SUMMER NIGHT,Lifted to meet the angel lips of air.
1093,A SUMMER NIGHT,"The many homes of men shine near and far,"
1094,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Peace-laden as the tender evening star,"
1095,A SUMMER NIGHT,The late home-coming folk anticipate
1096,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Their rest beyond the passing of the gate,"
1097,A SUMMER NIGHT,And tread with sleep-filled hearts and drowsy feet.
1098,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Oh, far away and wonderful and sweet"
1099,A SUMMER NIGHT,"All this, all this.  But far too many things"
1100,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Obscuring, as a cloud of seraph wings"
1101,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Blinding the seeker for the Lord behind,"
1102,A SUMMER NIGHT,I fall away in weariness of mind.
1103,A SUMMER NIGHT,"And think how far apart are I and you,"
1104,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Beloved, from those spirit children who"
1105,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Felt but one single Being long ago,"
1106,A SUMMER NIGHT,Whispering in gentleness and leaning low
1107,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Out of its majesty, as child to child."
1108,A SUMMER NIGHT,I think upon it all with heart grown wild.
1109,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Hearing no voice, howe'er my spirit broods,"
1110,A SUMMER NIGHT,"No whisper from the dense infinitudes,"
1111,A SUMMER NIGHT,This world of myriad things whose distance awes.

1694,NOTE,
1695,NOTE,"_Angus_, the Celtic Eros.  In the bardic stories he is described as a"
1696,NOTE,"tall, golden-haired youth playing on a harp and surrounded by singing"
1697,NOTE,birds.  The kisses of these birds created love and also brought death.
1698,NOTE,
1699,NOTE,"_Balor_, the prince of the dark powers.  His eye turned every living"
1700,NOTE,thing it rested on into stone.  He was killed at the battle of Moytura

1706,NOTE,
1707,NOTE,"_Etain_, a Celtic goddess who is the subject of a famous story, ""The"
1708,NOTE,"Wooing of Etain.""  She left the heaven world and became the wife of an"

1710,NOTE,
1711,NOTE,"_Lir_, the Oceanus of Celtic mythology.  Probably the Great Deep or"
1712,NOTE,original divinity from whom all sprang.  His son Mananan MacLir was the
1713,NOTE,most spiritual divinity known to the ancient Gael.  Lir is more
1714,NOTE,familiar as the father of the children who were changed into swans by
1715,NOTE,"magic, and who lived for long ages on the waters around the Irish"
1716,NOTE,coast.  The story of the fate of the children of Lir was probably in
1717,NOTE,its earliest form a mythological account of the descent of the spirit
1718,NOTE,from the Heaven-world to the Earth and its final redemption.
1719,NOTE,
1720,NOTE,"_Lugh_, the great god of light who led the De Danaans at the battle of"

1723,NOTE,
1724,NOTE,"_Fomor_, the dark powers who were opposed to the hosts of light, the"
1725,NOTE,Tuatha De Danaan.  They enslaved the latter for a time until the De

1733,NOTE,of tales.
1734,NOTE,
1735,NOTE,"_Sacred Hazel_, the Celtic tree of life.  It grew over Connla's Well,"
1736,NOTE,and the fruit which fell from it were the Nuts of Knowledge which give
1737,NOTE,wisdom and inspiration.  Connla's Well is a Celtic equivalent of the
