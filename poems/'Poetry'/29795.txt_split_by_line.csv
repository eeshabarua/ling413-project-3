40,I.,I.
41,I.,
42,I.,"They who maintained their rights,"
43,I.,"Through storm and stress,"
44,I.,And walked in all the ways
45,I.,"That God made known,"
46,I.,"Led by no wandering lights,"
47,I.,"And by no guess,"
48,I.,Through dark and desolate days
49,I.,Of trial and moan:
50,I.,Here let their monument
51,I.,"Rise, like a word"
52,I.,In rock commemorative
53,I.,Of our Land's youth;
54,I.,"Of ways the Puritan went,"
55,I.,With soul love-spurred
56,I.,"To suffer, die, and live"
57,I.,For faith and truth.
58,I.,Here they the corner-stone
59,I.,Of Freedom laid;
60,I.,Here in their hearts' distress
61,I.,They lit the lights
62,I.,Of Liberty alone;
63,I.,"Here, with God's aid,"
64,I.,"Conquered the wilderness,"
65,I.,Secured their rights.
66,I.,"Not men, but giants, they,"
67,I.,Who wrought with toil
68,I.,And sweat of brawn and brain
69,I.,Their freehold here;
70,I.,"Who, with their blood, each day"
71,I.,Hallowed the soil.
72,I.,And left it without stain
73,I.,And without fear.
74,I.,
75,I.,
76,II.,II.
77,II.,
78,II.,"Yea; here, from men like these,"
79,II.,Our country had its stanch beginning;
80,II.,Hence sprang she with the ocean breeze
81,II.,And pine scent in her hair;
82,II.,"Deep in her eyes the winning,"
83,II.,The far-off winning of the unmeasured West;
84,II.,"And in her heart the care,"
85,II.,"The young unrest,"
86,II.,"Of all that she must dare,"
87,II.,Ere as a mighty Nation she should stand
88,II.,"Towering from sea to sea,"
89,II.,"From land to mountained land,"
90,II.,One with the imperishable beauty of the stars
91,II.,In absolute destiny;
92,II.,"Part of that cosmic law, no shadow mars,"
93,II.,"To which all freedom runs,"
94,II.,That wheels the circles of the worlds and suns
95,II.,"Along their courses through the vasty night,"
96,II.,Irrevocable and eternal as is Light.
97,II.,
98,II.,
99,III.,III.
100,III.,
101,III.,What people has to-day
102,III.,"Such faith as launched and sped,"
103,III.,"With psalm and prayer, the Mayflower on its way?--"
104,III.,Such faith as led
105,III.,"The Dorchester fishers to this sea-washed point,"
106,III.,This granite headland of Cape Ann?
107,III.,"Where first they made their bed,"
108,III.,"Salt-blown and wet with brine,"
109,III.,"In cold and hunger, where the storm-wrenched pine"
110,III.,"Clung to the rock with desperate footing. They,"
111,III.,"With hearts courageous whom hope did anoint,"
112,III.,"Despite their tar and tan,"
113,III.,"Worn of the wind and spray,"
114,III.,"Seem more to me than man,"
115,III.,With their unconquerable spirits.--Mountains may
116,III.,"Succumb to men like these, to wills like theirs,--"
117,III.,The Puritan's tenacity to do;
118,III.,The stubbornness of genius;--holding to
119,III.,"Their purpose to the end,"
120,III.,No New-World hardship could deflect or bend;--
121,III.,"That never doubted in their worst despairs,"
122,III.,But steadily on their way
123,III.,"Held to the last, trusting in God, who filled"
124,III.,Their souls with fire of faith that helped them build
125,III.,"A country, greater than had ever thrilled"
126,III.,"Man's wildest dreams, or entered in"
127,III.,His highest hopes. 'Twas this that helped them win
128,III.,"In spite of danger and distress,"
129,III.,Through darkness and the din
130,III.,"Of winds and waves, unto a wilderness,"
131,III.,"Savage, unbounded, pathless as the sea,"
132,III.,"That said, ""Behold me! I am free!"""
133,III.,Giving itself to them for greater things
134,III.,Than filled their souls with dim imaginings.
135,III.,
136,III.,
137,IV.,IV.
138,IV.,
139,IV.,"Let History record their stalwart names,"
140,IV.,"And catalogue their fortitude, whence grew,"
141,IV.,"Swiftly as running flames,"
142,IV.,Cities and civilization:
143,IV.,"How from a meeting-house and school,"
144,IV.,"A few log-huddled cabins, Freedom drew"
145,IV.,"Her rude beginnings. Every pioneer station,"
146,IV.,"Each settlement, though primitive of tool,"
147,IV.,Had in it then the making of a Nation;
148,IV.,Had in it then the roofing of the plains
149,IV.,With traffic; and the piercing through and through
150,IV.,Of forests with the iron veins
151,IV.,Of industry.
152,IV.,Would I could make you see
153,IV.,"How these, laboriously,"
154,IV.,"These founders of New England, every hour"
155,IV.,"Faced danger, death, and misery,"
156,IV.,Conquering the wilderness;
157,IV.,With supernatural power
158,IV.,Changing its features; all its savage glower
159,IV.,"Of wild barbarity, fierce hate, duress,"
160,IV.,"To something human, something that could bless"
161,IV.,Mankind with peace and lift its heart's elation;
162,IV.,Something at last that stood
163,IV.,"For universal brotherhood,"
164,IV.,"Astonishing the world, a mighty Nation,"
165,IV.,Hewn from the solitude.--
166,IV.,"Iron of purpose as of faith and daring,"
167,IV.,"And of indomitable will,"
168,IV.,"With axe and hymn-book still I see them faring,"
169,IV.,The Saxon Spirit of Conquest at their side
170,IV.,"With sword and flintlock; still I see them stride,"
171,IV.,"As to some Roundhead rhyme,"
172,IV.,Adown the aisles of Time.
173,IV.,
174,IV.,
175,V.,V.
176,V.,
177,V.,Can praise be simply said of such as these?
178,V.,"Such men as Standish, Winthrop, Endicott?"
179,V.,Such souls as Roger Conant and John White?
180,V.,"Rugged and great as trees,"
181,V.,The oaks of that New World with which their lot
182,V.,"Was cast forever, proudly to remain."
183,V.,"That world in which each name still stands, a light"
184,V.,To beacon the Ship of State through stormy seas.
185,V.,Can praise be simply said
186,V.,"Of him, the younger Vane,"
187,V.,"Puritan and patriot,"
188,V.,Whose dedicated head
189,V.,Was laid upon the block
190,V.,"In thy name, Liberty!"
191,V.,Can praise be simply said of such as he!
192,V.,Needs must the soul unlock
193,V.,All gates of eloquence to sing of these.
194,V.,"Such periods,"
195,V.,"Such epic melodies,"
196,V.,"As holds the utterance of the earlier gods,"
197,V.,"The lords of song, one needs"
198,V.,To sing the praise of these!
199,V.,"No feeble music, tinklings frail of glass;"
200,V.,"No penny trumpetings; twitterings of brass,"
201,V.,"The moment's effort, shak'n from pigmy bells,"
202,V.,"Ephemeral drops from small Pierian wells,"
203,V.,With which the Age relieves a barren hour.
204,V.,"But such large music, such melodious power,"
205,V.,"As have our cataracts,"
206,V.,"Pouring the iron facts,"
207,V.,The giant acts
208,V.,Of these: such song as have our rock-ridged deep
209,V.,"And mountain steeps,"
210,V.,"When winds, like clanging eagles, sweep the storm"
211,V.,On tossing wood and farm:
212,V.,"Such eloquence as in the torrent leaps,--"
213,V.,"Where the hoarse canyon sleeps,"
214,V.,"Holding the heart with its terrific charm,"
215,V.,"Carrying its roaring message to the town,--"
216,V.,To voice their high achievement and renown.
217,V.,
218,V.,
219,VI.,VI.
220,VI.,
221,VI.,"Long, long ago, beneath heaven's stormy slope,"
222,VI.,"In deeds of faith and hope,"
223,VI.,"Our fathers laid Freedom's foundations here,"
224,VI.,"And raised, invisible, vast,--"
225,VI.,"Embodying naught of doubt or fear,"
226,VI.,A monument whose greatness shall outlast
227,VI.,"The future, as the past,"
228,VI.,Of all the Old World's dynasties and kings.--
229,VI.,A symbol of all things
230,VI.,"That we would speak, but cannot say in words,"
231,VI.,"Of those who first began our Nation here,"
232,VI.,"Behold, we now would rear!"
233,VI.,"A different monument! a thought, that girds"
234,VI.,Itself with granite; dream made visible
235,VI.,In rock and bronze to tell
236,VI.,To all the Future what here once befell;
237,VI.,"Here where, unknown to them,"
238,VI.,A tree took root; a tree of wondrous stem;
239,VI.,"The tree of high ideals, which has grown,"
240,VI.,"And has not withered since its seed was sown,"
241,VI.,"Was planted here by them in this new soil,"
242,VI.,Who watered it with tears and blood and toil:
243,VI.,"An heritage we mean to hold,"
244,VI.,Keeping it stanch and beautiful as of old.--
245,VI.,"For never a State,"
246,VI.,"Or People, yet was great"
247,VI.,Without its great ideals;--branch and root
248,VI.,Of the deep tree of life where bud and blow
249,VI.,"The dreams, the thoughts, that grow"
250,VI.,"To deeds, the glowing fruit."
251,VI.,
252,VI.,
253,VII.,VII.
254,VII.,
255,VII.,"The morn, that breaks its heart of gold"
256,VII.,Above the purple hills;
257,VII.,"The eve, that spills"
258,VII.,Its nautilus splendor where the sea is rolled;
259,VII.,"The night, that leads the vast procession in"
260,VII.,"Of stars and dreams,--"
261,VII.,The beauty that shall never die or pass:--
262,VII.,"The winds, that spin"
263,VII.,"Of rain the misty mantles of the grass,"
264,VII.,And thunder-raiment of the mountain-streams;
265,VII.,"The sunbeams, needling with gold the dusk"
266,VII.,Green cowls of ancient woods;
267,VII.,"The shadows, thridding, veiled with musk,"
268,VII.,"The moon-pathed solitudes,"
269,VII.,"Call to my Fancy, saying, ""Follow! follow!"""
270,VII.,"Till, following, I see,--"
271,VII.,"Fair as a cascade in a rainbowed hollow,--"
272,VII.,"A dream, a shape, take form,"
273,VII.,"Clad on with every charm,--"
274,VII.,"The vision of that Ideality,"
275,VII.,"Which lured the pioneer in wood and hill,"
276,VII.,And beckoned him from earth and sky;
277,VII.,"The dream that cannot die,"
278,VII.,Their children's children did fulfill.
279,VII.,"In stone and iron and wood,"
280,VII.,"Out of the solitude,"
281,VII.,And by a forthright act
282,VII.,Create a mighty fact--
283,VII.,"A Nation, now that stands"
284,VII.,"Clad on with hope and beauty, strength and song,"
285,VII.,"Eternal, young, and strong,"
286,VII.,"Planting her heel on Wrong,"
287,VII.,Her starry banner in triumphant hands....
288,VII.,Within her face the rose
289,VII.,Of Alleghany dawns;
290,VII.,"Limbed with Alaskan snows,"
291,VII.,"Floridian starlight in her eyes,--"
292,VII.,"Eyes stern as steel yet tender as a fawn's,--"
293,VII.,And in her hair
294,VII.,"The rapture of her rivers; and the dare,"
295,VII.,"As perishless as truth,"
296,VII.,"That o'er the crags of her Sierras flies,"
297,VII.,"Urging the eagle ardor through her veins,"
298,VII.,"Behold her where,"
299,VII.,"Around her radiant youth,"
300,VII.,"The spirits of the cataracts and plains,"
301,VII.,"The genii of the floods and forests, meet,"
302,VII.,In rainbow mists circling her brow and feet:
303,VII.,The forces vast that sit
304,VII.,"In session round her; powers paraclete,"
305,VII.,That guard her presence; awful forms and fair.
306,VII.,Making secure her place;
307,VII.,Guiding her surely as the worlds through space
308,VII.,"Do laws sidereal; edicts, thunder-lit,"
309,VII.,"Of skyed eternity, in splendor borne"
310,VII.,On planetary wings of night and morn.
311,VII.,
312,VII.,
313,VIII.,VIII.
314,VIII.,
315,VIII.,Behold her! this is she!
316,VIII.,"Beautiful as morning on the summer sea,"
317,VIII.,Yet terrible as is the elemental gold
318,VIII.,That cleaves the tempest and in angles clings
319,VIII.,About its cloudy temples.--Manifold
320,VIII.,"The dreams of daring in her fearless gaze,"
321,VIII.,Fixed on the future's days;
322,VIII.,"And round her brow, a strand of astral beads,"
323,VIII.,Her soul's resplendent deeds;
324,VIII.,"And at her front one star,"
325,VIII.,"Refulgent hope,"
326,VIII.,"Like that on morning's slope,"
327,VIII.,Beaconing the world afar.--
328,VIII.,From her high place she sees
329,VIII.,Her long procession of accomplished acts.
330,VIII.,Cloud-wing'd refulgences
331,VIII.,"Of thoughts in steel and stone, of marble dreams,"
332,VIII.,"Lift up tremendous battlements,"
333,VIII.,"Sun-blinding, built of facts;"
334,VIII.,"While in her soul she seems,"
335,VIII.,"Listening, to hear, as from innumerable tents,"
336,VIII.,"Æonian thunder, wonder, and applause"
337,VIII.,Of all the heroic ages that are gone;
338,VIII.,Feeling secure
339,VIII.,"That, as her Past, her Future shall endure,"
340,VIII.,As did her Cause
341,VIII.,When redly broke the dawn
342,VIII.,"Of fierce rebellion, and, beneath its star,"
343,VIII.,The firmaments of war
344,VIII.,"Poured down infernal rain,"
345,VIII.,And North and South lay bleeding 'mid their slain.
346,VIII.,"And now, no less, shall her Cause still prevail,"
347,VIII.,"More so in peace than war,"
348,VIII.,"Through the thrilled wire and electric rail,"
349,VIII.,Carrying her message far;
350,VIII.,Shaping her dream
351,VIII.,"Within the brain of steam,"
352,VIII.,"That, with a myriad hands,"
353,VIII.,"Labors unceasingly, and knits her lands"
354,VIII.,In firmer union; joining plain and stream
355,VIII.,With steel; and binding shore to shore
356,VIII.,"With bands of iron;--nerves and arteries,"
357,VIII.,Along whose adamant forever pour
358,VIII.,"Her concrete thoughts, her tireless energies."
