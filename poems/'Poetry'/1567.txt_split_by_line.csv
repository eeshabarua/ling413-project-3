53,POEMS,
54,POEMS,Gerontion
55,POEMS,
56,POEMS,Thou hast nor youth nor age
57,POEMS,But as it were an after dinner sleep
58,POEMS,Dreaming of both.
59,POEMS,
60,POEMS,
61,POEMS,"Here I am, an old man in a dry month,"
62,POEMS,"Being read to by a boy, waiting for rain."
63,POEMS,I was neither at the hot gates
64,POEMS,Nor fought in the warm rain
65,POEMS,"Nor knee deep in the salt marsh, heaving a cutlass,"
66,POEMS,"Bitten by flies, fought."
67,POEMS,"My house is a decayed house,"
68,POEMS,"And the jew squats on the window sill, the owner,"
69,POEMS,"Spawned in some estaminet of Antwerp,"
70,POEMS,"Blistered in Brussels, patched and peeled in London."
71,POEMS,The goat coughs at night in the field overhead;
72,POEMS,"Rocks, moss, stonecrop, iron, merds."
73,POEMS,"The woman keeps the kitchen, makes tea,"
74,POEMS,"Sneezes at evening, poking the peevish gutter."
75,POEMS,
76,POEMS,"I an old man,"
77,POEMS,A dull head among windy spaces.
78,POEMS,
79,POEMS,"Signs are taken for wonders. ""We would see a sign"":"
80,POEMS,"The word within a word, unable to speak a word,"
81,POEMS,Swaddled with darkness. In the juvescence of the year
82,POEMS,Came Christ the tiger
83,POEMS,
84,POEMS,"In depraved May, dogwood and chestnut, flowering Judas,"
85,POEMS,"To be eaten, to be divided, to be drunk"
86,POEMS,Among whispers; by Mr. Silvero
87,POEMS,"With caressing hands, at Limoges"
88,POEMS,Who walked all night in the next room;
89,POEMS,"By Hakagawa, bowing among the Titians;"
90,POEMS,"By Madame de Tornquist, in the dark room"
91,POEMS,Shifting the candles; Fraulein von Kulp
92,POEMS,"Who turned in the hall, one hand on the door. Vacant shuttles"
93,POEMS,"Weave the wind. I have no ghosts,"
94,POEMS,An old man in a draughty house
95,POEMS,Under a windy knob.
96,POEMS,
97,POEMS,"After such knowledge, what forgiveness? Think now"
98,POEMS,"History has many cunning passages, contrived corridors"
99,POEMS,"And issues, deceives with whispering ambitions,"
100,POEMS,Guides us by vanities. Think now
101,POEMS,She gives when our attention is distracted
102,POEMS,"And what she gives, gives with such supple confusions"
103,POEMS,That the giving famishes the craving. Gives too late
104,POEMS,"What's not believed in, or if still believed,"
105,POEMS,"In memory only, reconsidered passion. Gives too soon"
106,POEMS,"Into weak hands, what's thought can be dispensed with"
107,POEMS,Till the refusal propagates a fear. Think
108,POEMS,Neither fear nor courage saves us. Unnatural vices
109,POEMS,Are fathered by our heroism. Virtues
110,POEMS,Are forced upon us by our impudent crimes.
111,POEMS,These tears are shaken from the wrath-bearing tree.
112,POEMS,
113,POEMS,The tiger springs in the new year. Us he devours. Think at last
114,POEMS,"We have not reached conclusion, when I"
115,POEMS,Stiffen in a rented house. Think at last
116,POEMS,I have not made this show purposelessly
117,POEMS,And it is not by any concitation
118,POEMS,Of the backward devils.
119,POEMS,I would meet you upon this honestly.
120,POEMS,I that was near your heart was removed therefrom
121,POEMS,"To lose beauty in terror, terror in inquisition."
122,POEMS,I have lost my passion: why should I need to keep it
123,POEMS,Since what is kept must be adulterated?
124,POEMS,"I have lost my sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch:"
125,POEMS,How should I use it for your closer contact?
126,POEMS,
127,POEMS,These with a thousand small deliberations
128,POEMS,"Protract the profit of their chilled delirium,"
129,POEMS,"Excite the membrane, when the sense has cooled,"
130,POEMS,"With pungent sauces, multiply variety"
131,POEMS,"In a wilderness of mirrors. What will the spider do,"
132,POEMS,"Suspend its operations, will the weevil"
133,POEMS,"Delay? De Bailhache, Fresca, Mrs. Cammel, whirled"
134,POEMS,Beyond the circuit of the shuddering Bear
135,POEMS,"In fractured atoms. Gull against the wind, in the windy straits"
136,POEMS,"Of Belle Isle, or running on the Horn,"
137,POEMS,"White feathers in the snow, the Gulf claims,"
138,POEMS,And an old man driven by the Trades
139,POEMS,To a sleepy corner.
140,POEMS,
141,POEMS,"Tenants of the house,"
142,POEMS,Thoughts of a dry brain in a dry season.
143,POEMS,
144,POEMS,
145,POEMS,
146,POEMS,
147,POEMS,Burbank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar
148,POEMS,
149,POEMS,Tra-la-la-la-la-la-laire--nil nisi divinum stabile
150,POEMS,"est; caetera fumus--the gondola stopped, the old"
151,POEMS,"palace was there, how charming its grey and pink--"
152,POEMS,"goats and monkeys, with such hair too!--so the"
153,POEMS,countess passed on until she came through the
154,POEMS,"little park, where Niobe presented her with a"
155,POEMS,"cabinet, and so departed."
156,POEMS,
157,POEMS,
158,POEMS,Burbank crossed a little bridge
159,POEMS,Descending at a small hotel;
160,POEMS,"Princess Volupine arrived,"
161,POEMS,"They were together, and he fell."
162,POEMS,
163,POEMS,Defunctive music under sea
164,POEMS,Passed seaward with the passing bell
165,POEMS,Slowly: the God Hercules
166,POEMS,"Had left him, that had loved him well."
167,POEMS,
168,POEMS,"The horses, under the axletree"
169,POEMS,Beat up the dawn from Istria
170,POEMS,With even feet. Her shuttered barge
171,POEMS,Burned on the water all the day.
172,POEMS,
173,POEMS,But this or such was Bleistein's way:
174,POEMS,A saggy bending of the knees
175,POEMS,"And elbows, with the palms turned out,"
176,POEMS,Chicago Semite Viennese.
177,POEMS,
178,POEMS,A lustreless protrusive eye
179,POEMS,Stares from the protozoic slime
180,POEMS,At a perspective of Canaletto.
181,POEMS,The smoky candle end of time
182,POEMS,
183,POEMS,Declines. On the Rialto once.
184,POEMS,The rats are underneath the piles.
185,POEMS,The jew is underneath the lot.
186,POEMS,"Money in furs. The boatman smiles,"
187,POEMS,
188,POEMS,Princess Volupine extends
189,POEMS,"A meagre, blue-nailed, phthisic hand"
190,POEMS,"To climb the waterstair. Lights, lights,"
191,POEMS,She entertains Sir Ferdinand
192,POEMS,
193,POEMS,Klein. Who clipped the lion's wings
194,POEMS,And flea'd his rump and pared his claws?
195,POEMS,"Thought Burbank, meditating on"
196,POEMS,"Time's ruins, and the seven laws."
197,POEMS,
198,POEMS,
199,POEMS,
200,POEMS,
201,POEMS,Sweeney Erect
202,POEMS,
203,POEMS,"And the trees about me,"
204,POEMS,Let them be dry and leafless; let the rocks
205,POEMS,Groan with continual surges; and behind me
206,POEMS,"Make all a desolation. Look, look, wenches!"
207,POEMS,
208,POEMS,
209,POEMS,Paint me a cavernous waste shore
210,POEMS,"Cast in the unstilted Cyclades,"
211,POEMS,Paint me the bold anfractuous rocks
212,POEMS,Faced by the snarled and yelping seas.
213,POEMS,
214,POEMS,Display me Aeolus above
215,POEMS,Reviewing the insurgent gales
216,POEMS,Which tangle Ariadne's hair
217,POEMS,And swell with haste the perjured sails.
218,POEMS,
219,POEMS,Morning stirs the feet and hands
220,POEMS,"(Nausicaa and Polypheme),"
221,POEMS,Gesture of orang-outang
222,POEMS,Rises from the sheets in steam.
223,POEMS,
224,POEMS,This withered root of knots of hair
225,POEMS,"Slitted below and gashed with eyes,"
226,POEMS,This oval O cropped out with teeth:
227,POEMS,The sickle motion from the thighs
228,POEMS,
229,POEMS,Jackknifes upward at the knees
230,POEMS,Then straightens out from heel to hip
231,POEMS,Pushing the framework of the bed
232,POEMS,And clawing at the pillow slip.
233,POEMS,
234,POEMS,Sweeney addressed full length to shave
235,POEMS,"Broadbottomed, pink from nape to base,"
236,POEMS,Knows the female temperament
237,POEMS,And wipes the suds around his face.
238,POEMS,
239,POEMS,(The lengthened shadow of a man
240,POEMS,"Is history, said Emerson"
241,POEMS,Who had not seen the silhouette
242,POEMS,Of Sweeney straddled in the sun).
243,POEMS,
244,POEMS,Tests the razor on his leg
245,POEMS,Waiting until the shriek subsides.
246,POEMS,The epileptic on the bed
247,POEMS,"Curves backward, clutching at her sides."
248,POEMS,
249,POEMS,The ladies of the corridor
250,POEMS,"Find themselves involved, disgraced,"
251,POEMS,Call witness to their principles
252,POEMS,And deprecate the lack of taste
253,POEMS,
254,POEMS,Observing that hysteria
255,POEMS,Might easily be misunderstood;
256,POEMS,Mrs. Turner intimates
257,POEMS,It does the house no sort of good.
258,POEMS,
259,POEMS,"But Doris, towelled from the bath,"
260,POEMS,"Enters padding on broad feet,"
261,POEMS,Bringing sal volatile
262,POEMS,And a glass of brandy neat.
263,POEMS,
264,POEMS,

267,POEMS,A Cooking Egg
268,POEMS,

270,POEMS,Que toutes mes hontes j'ay beues...
271,POEMS,
272,POEMS,
273,POEMS,Pipit sate upright in her chair
274,POEMS,Some distance from where I was sitting;
275,POEMS,Views of the Oxford Colleges
276,POEMS,"Lay on the table, with the knitting."
277,POEMS,
278,POEMS,"Daguerreotypes and silhouettes,"
279,POEMS,"Her grandfather and great great aunts,"
280,POEMS,Supported on the mantelpiece
281,POEMS,An Invitation to the Dance.
282,POEMS,.    .    .    .    .    .
283,POEMS,I shall not want Honour in Heaven
284,POEMS,For I shall meet Sir Philip Sidney
285,POEMS,And have talk with Coriolanus
286,POEMS,And other heroes of that kidney.
287,POEMS,
288,POEMS,I shall not want Capital in Heaven
289,POEMS,For I shall meet Sir Alfred Mond:
290,POEMS,"We two shall lie together, lapt"
291,POEMS,In a five per cent Exchequer Bond.
292,POEMS,
293,POEMS,"I shall not want Society in Heaven,"
294,POEMS,Lucretia Borgia shall be my Bride;
295,POEMS,Her anecdotes will be more amusing
296,POEMS,Than Pipit's experience could provide.
297,POEMS,
298,POEMS,I shall not want Pipit in Heaven:
299,POEMS,Madame Blavatsky will instruct me
300,POEMS,In the Seven Sacred Trances;
301,POEMS,Piccarda de Donati will conduct me.
302,POEMS,
303,POEMS,.    .    .    .    .    .
304,POEMS,
305,POEMS,But where is the penny world I bought
306,POEMS,To eat with Pipit behind the screen?
307,POEMS,The red-eyed scavengers are creeping
308,POEMS,From Kentish Town and Golder's Green;
309,POEMS,
310,POEMS,Where are the eagles and the trumpets?
311,POEMS,
312,POEMS,Buried beneath some snow-deep Alps.
313,POEMS,Over buttered scones and crumpets
314,POEMS,"Weeping, weeping multitudes"
315,POEMS,Droop in a hundred A.B.C.'s
316,POEMS,
317,POEMS,"[""ABC's"" signifes endemic teashops, found in all parts of"

370,POEMS,Je celebrai mon jour de fête
371,POEMS,Dans une oasis d'Afrique
372,POEMS,Vêtu d'une peau de girafe.

384,POEMS,A l'sur le dos écartant les genoux
385,POEMS,De quatre jambes molles tout gonflées de morsures.
386,POEMS,On relève le drap pour mieux égratigner.

838,I,Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
839,I,You have the scene arrange itself--as it will seem to do--
840,I,"With ""I have saved this afternoon for you"";"
841,I,"And four wax candles in the darkened room,"
842,I,"Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,"
843,I,An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
844,I,"Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid."
845,I,"We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole"
846,I,"Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips."
847,I,"""So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul"
848,I,Should be resurrected only among friends
849,I,"Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom"
850,I,"That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."""
851,I,--And so the conversation slips
852,I,Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
853,I,Through attenuated tones of violins
854,I,Mingled with remote cornets
855,I,And begins.
856,I,
857,I,"""You do not know how much they mean to me, my friends,"
858,I,"And how, how rare and strange it is, to find"
859,I,"In a life composed so much, so much of odds and ends,"
860,I,(For indeed I do not love it... you knew? you are not blind!
861,I,How keen you are!)
862,I,"To find a friend who has these qualities,"
863,I,"Who has, and gives"
864,I,Those qualities upon which friendship lives.
865,I,How much it means that I say this to you--
866,I,"Without these friendships--life, what cauchemar!"""
867,I,Among the windings of the violins
868,I,And the ariettes
869,I,Of cracked cornets
870,I,Inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins
871,I,"Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own,"
872,I,Capricious monotone
873,I,"That is at least one definite ""false note."""
874,I,"--Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance,"
875,I,Admire the monuments
876,I,"Discuss the late events,"
877,I,Correct our watches by the public clocks.
878,I,Then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks.
879,I,
880,II,II
881,II,
882,II,Now that lilacs are in bloom
883,II,She has a bowl of lilacs in her room
884,II,And twists one in her fingers while she talks.
885,II,"""Ah, my friend, you do not know, you do not know"
886,II,"What life is, you should hold it in your hands"";"
887,II,(Slowly twisting the lilac stalks)
888,II,"""You let it flow from you, you let it flow,"
889,II,"And youth is cruel, and has no remorse"
890,II,"And smiles at situations which it cannot see."""
891,II,"I smile, of course,"
892,II,And go on drinking tea.
893,II,"""Yet with these April sunsets, that somehow recall"
894,II,"My buried life, and Paris in the Spring,"
895,II,"I feel immeasurably at peace, and find the world"
896,II,"To be wonderful and youthful, after all."""
897,II,
898,II,The voice returns like the insistent out-of-tune
899,II,Of a broken violin on an August afternoon:
900,II,"""I am always sure that you understand"
901,II,"My feelings, always sure that you feel,"
902,II,Sure that across the gulf you reach your hand.
903,II,
904,II,"You are invulnerable, you have no Achilles' heel."
905,II,"You will go on, and when you have prevailed"
906,II,You can say: at this point many a one has failed.
907,II,
908,II,"But what have I, but what have I, my friend,"
909,II,"To give you, what can you receive from me?"
910,II,Only the friendship and the sympathy
911,II,Of one about to reach her journey's end.
912,II,
913,II,"I shall sit here, serving tea to friends...."""
914,II,
915,II,I take my hat: how can I make a cowardly amends
916,II,For what she has said to me?
917,II,You will see me any morning in the park
918,II,Reading the comics and the sporting page.
919,II,Particularly I remark An English countess goes upon the stage.
920,II,"A Greek was murdered at a Polish dance,"
921,II,Another bank defaulter has confessed.
922,II,"I keep my countenance, I remain self-possessed"
923,II,"Except when a street piano, mechanical and tired"
924,II,Reiterates some worn-out common song
925,II,With the smell of hyacinths across the garden
926,II,Recalling things that other people have desired.
927,II,Are these ideas right or wrong?
928,II,
929,III,III
930,III,
931,III,The October night comes down; returning as before
932,III,Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease
933,III,I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door
934,III,And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and knees.
935,III,
936,III,"""And so you are going abroad; and when do you return?"
937,III,But that's a useless question.
938,III,"You hardly know when you are coming back,"
939,III,"You will find so much to learn."""
940,III,My smile falls heavily among the bric-à-brac.
941,III,
942,III,"""Perhaps you can write to me."""
943,III,My self-possession flares up for a second;
944,III,This is as I had reckoned.
945,III,
946,III,"""I have been wondering frequently of late"
947,III,(But our beginnings never know our ends!)
948,III,"Why we have not developed into friends."""
949,III,"I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark"
950,III,"Suddenly, his expression in a glass."
951,III,My self-possession gutters; we are really in the dark.
952,III,
953,III,"""For everybody said so, all our friends,"
954,III,They all were sure our feelings would relate
955,III,So closely! I myself can hardly understand.
956,III,We must leave it now to fate.
957,III,"You will write, at any rate."
958,III,Perhaps it is not too late.
959,III,"I shall sit here, serving tea to friends."""
960,III,
961,III,And I must borrow every changing shape
962,III,"To find expression... dance, dance"
963,III,"Like a dancing bear,"
964,III,"Cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape."
965,III,"Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance--"
966,III,"Well! and what if she should die some afternoon,"
967,III,"Afternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose;"
968,III,Should die and leave me sitting pen in hand
969,III,With the smoke coming down above the housetops;
970,III,"Doubtful, for quite a while"
971,III,Not knowing what to feel or if I understand
972,III,"Or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon..."
973,III,"Would she not have the advantage, after all?"
974,III,"This music is successful with a ""dying fall"""
975,III,Now that we talk of dying--
976,III,And should I have the right to smile?

984,I,
985,I,The winter evening settles down
986,I,With smell of steaks in passageways.
987,I,Six o'clock.
988,I,The burnt-out ends of smoky days.
989,I,And now a gusty shower wraps
990,I,The grimy scraps
991,I,Of withered leaves about your feet
992,I,And newspapers from vacant lots;
993,I,The showers beat
994,I,"On broken blinds and chimney-pots,"
995,I,And at the corner of the street
996,I,A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.
997,I,And then the lighting of the lamps.
998,I,
999,II,II
1000,II,
1001,II,The morning comes to consciousness
1002,II,Of faint stale smells of beer
1003,II,From the sawdust-trampled street
1004,II,With all its muddy feet that press
1005,II,To early coffee-stands.
1006,II,
1007,II,With the other masquerades
1008,II,"That time resumes,"
1009,II,One thinks of all the hands
1010,II,That are raising dingy shades
1011,II,In a thousand furnished rooms.
1012,II,
1013,III,III
1014,III,
1015,III,"You tossed a blanket from the bed,"
1016,III,"You lay upon your back, and waited;"
1017,III,"You dozed, and watched the night revealing"
1018,III,The thousand sordid images
1019,III,Of which your soul was constituted;
1020,III,They flickered against the ceiling.
1021,III,And when all the world came back
1022,III,"And the light crept up between the shutters,"
1023,III,"And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,"
1024,III,You had such a vision of the street
1025,III,As the street hardly understands;
1026,III,"Sitting along the bed's edge, where"
1027,III,"You curled the papers from your hair,"
1028,III,Or clasped the yellow soles of feet
1029,III,In the palms of both soiled hands.
1030,III,
1031,IV,IV
1032,IV,
1033,IV,His soul stretched tight across the skies
1034,IV,"That fade behind a city block,"
1035,IV,Or trampled by insistent feet
1036,IV,At four and five and six o'clock;
1037,IV,"And short square fingers stuffing pipes,"
1038,IV,"And evening newspapers, and eyes"
1039,IV,"Assured of certain certainties,"
1040,IV,The conscience of a blackened street
1041,IV,Impatient to assume the world.
1042,IV,
1043,IV,I am moved by fancies that are curled
1044,IV,"Around these images, and cling:"
1045,IV,The notion of some infinitely gentle
1046,IV,Infinitely suffering thing.
1047,IV,
1048,IV,"Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;"
1049,IV,The worlds revolve like ancient women
1050,IV,Gathering fuel in vacant lots.

1055,IV,Rhapsody on a Windy Night

1057,IV,Twelve o'clock.
1058,IV,Along the reaches of the street
1059,IV,"Held in a lunar synthesis,"
1060,IV,Whispering lunar incantations
1061,IV,Disolve the floors of memory
1062,IV,"And all its clear relations,"
1063,IV,"Its divisions and precisions,"
1064,IV,Every street lamp that I pass
1065,IV,"Beats like a fatalistic drum,"
1066,IV,And through the spaces of the dark
1067,IV,Midnight shakes the memory
1068,IV,As a madman shakes a dead geranium.
1069,IV,
1070,IV,"Half-past one,"
1071,IV,"The street lamp sputtered,"
1072,IV,"The street lamp muttered,"
1073,IV,"The street lamp said,"
1074,IV,"""Regard that woman"
1075,IV,Who hesitates toward you in the light of the door
1076,IV,Which opens on her like a grin.
1077,IV,You see the border of her dress
1078,IV,"Is torn and stained with sand,"
1079,IV,And you see the corner of her eye
1080,IV,"Twists like a crooked pin."""
1081,IV,
1082,IV,The memory throws up high and dry
1083,IV,A crowd of twisted things;
1084,IV,A twisted branch upon the beach
1085,IV,"Eaten smooth, and polished"
1086,IV,As if the world gave up
1087,IV,"The secret of its skeleton,"
1088,IV,Stiff and white.
1089,IV,"A broken spring in a factory yard,"
1090,IV,Rust that clings to the form that the strength has left
1091,IV,Hard and curled and ready to snap.
1092,IV,
1093,IV,"Half-past two,"
1094,IV,"The street-lamp said,"
1095,IV,"""Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,"
1096,IV,Slips out its tongue
1097,IV,"And devours a morsel of rancid butter."""
1098,IV,"So the hand of the child, automatic,"
1099,IV,Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along
1100,IV,the quay.
1101,IV,I could see nothing behind that child's eye.
1102,IV,I have seen eyes in the street
1103,IV,"Trying to peer through lighted shutters,"
1104,IV,"And a crab one afternoon in a pool,"
1105,IV,"An old crab with barnacles on his back,"
1106,IV,Gripped the end of a stick which I held him.
1107,IV,
1108,IV,"Half-past three,"
1109,IV,"The lamp sputtered,"
1110,IV,The lamp muttered in the dark.
1111,IV,
1112,IV,The lamp hummed:
1113,IV,"""Regard the moon,"
1114,IV,"La lune ne garde aucune rancune,"
1115,IV,"She winks a feeble eye,"
1116,IV,She smiles into corners.
1117,IV,She smooths the hair of the grass.
1118,IV,The moon has lost her memory.
1119,IV,"A washed-out smallpox cracks her face,"
1120,IV,"Her hand twists a paper rose,"
1121,IV,"That smells of dust and old Cologne,"
1122,IV,She is alone With all the old nocturnal smells
1123,IV,That cross and cross across her brain.
1124,IV,The reminiscence comes
1125,IV,Of sunless dry geraniums
1126,IV,"And dust in crevices,"
1127,IV,Smells of chestnuts in the streets
1128,IV,And female smells in shuttered rooms
1129,IV,And cigarettes in corridors
1130,IV,"And cocktail smells in bars."""
1131,IV,
1132,IV,"The lamp said,"
1133,IV,"""Four o'clock,"
1134,IV,Here is the number on the door.
1135,IV,Memory!
1136,IV,"You have the key,"
1137,IV,"The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair,"
1138,IV,Mount.
1139,IV,"The bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the wall,"
1140,IV,"Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life."""

1146,IV,
1147,IV,Morning at the Window
1148,IV,
1149,IV,"They are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens,"
1150,IV,And along the trampled edges of the street
1151,IV,I am aware of the damp souls of housemaids
1152,IV,Sprouting despondently at area gates.
1153,IV,The brown waves of fog toss up to me
1154,IV,"Twisted faces from the bottom of the street,"
1155,IV,And tear from a passer-by with muddy skirts
1156,IV,An aimless smile that hovers in the air
1157,IV,And vanishes along the level of the roofs.

1165,IV,Sway in the wind like a field of ripe corn.
1166,IV,"When evening quickens faintly in the street,"
1167,IV,Wakening the appetites of life in some
1168,IV,"And to others bringing the Boston Evening Transcript,"
1169,IV,"I mount the steps and ring the bell, turning"
1170,IV,"Wearily, as one would turn to nod good-bye to Rochefoucauld,"
1171,IV,"If the street were time and he at the end of the street,"

1180,IV,And lived in a small house near a fashionable square
1181,IV,Cared for by servants to the number of four.
1182,IV,Now when she died there was silence in heaven
1183,IV,And silence at her end of the street.
1184,IV,The shutters were drawn and the undertaker wiped his feet--
1185,IV,He was aware that this sort of thing had occurred before.
1186,IV,"The dogs were handsomely provided for,"
1187,IV,But shortly afterwards the parrot died too.
1188,IV,"The Dresden clock continued ticking on the mantelpiece,"
1189,IV,And the footman sat upon the dining-table

1203,IV,
1204,IV,Miss Nancy Ellicott smoked
1205,IV,And danced all the modern dances;

1207,IV,But they knew that it was modern.

1218,IV,When Mr. Apollinax visited the United States
1219,IV,His laughter tinkled among the teacups.
1220,IV,"I thought of Fragilion, that shy figure among the birch-trees,"
1221,IV,And of Priapus in the shrubbery
1222,IV,Gaping at the lady in the swing.
1223,IV,"In the palace of Mrs. Phlaccus, at Professor Channing-Cheetah's"
1224,IV,He laughed like an irresponsible foetus.
1225,IV,HWith your aid indiffeis laughter was submarine and profound
1226,IV,Like the old man of the sea's
1227,IV,Hidden under coral islands
1228,IV,"Where worried bodies of drowned men drift down in the green silence,"
1229,IV,Dropping from fingers of surf.
1230,IV,I looked for the head of Mr. Apollinax rolling under a chair
1231,IV,Or grinning over a screen
1232,IV,With seaweed in its hair.
1233,IV,I heard the beat of centaur's hoofs over the hard turf
1234,IV,As his dry and passionate talk devoured the afternoon.
1235,IV,"""He is a charming man""--""But after all what did he mean?""--"
1236,IV,"""His pointed ears... He must be unbalanced,""--"
1237,IV,"""There was something he said that I might have challenged."""

1248,IV,only accidental stars with a talent for squad-drill. I
1249,IV,"was drawn in by short gasps, inhaled at each momentary"
1250,IV,"recovery, lost finally in the dark caverns of her"
1251,IV,"throat, bruised by the ripple of unseen muscles. An"
1252,IV,elderly waiter with trembling hands was hurriedly
1253,IV,spreading a pink and white checked cloth over the rusty
1254,IV,"green iron table, saying: ""If the lady and gentleman"
1255,IV,"wish to take their tea in the garden, if the lady and"
1256,IV,"gentleman wish to take their tea in the garden..."" I"
1257,IV,decided that if the shaking of her breasts could be

1272,IV,"She then: ""How you digress!"""
1273,IV,
1274,IV,"And I then: ""Some one frames upon the keys"
1275,IV,"That exquisite nocturne, with which we explain"
1276,IV,The night and moonshine; music which we seize
1277,IV,"To body forth our vacuity."""
1278,IV,"She then: ""Does this refer to me?"""
1279,IV,"""Oh no, it is I who am inane."""
1280,IV,
1281,IV,"""You, madam, are the eternal humorist,"
1282,IV,"The eternal enemy of the absolute,"
1283,IV,Giving our vagrant moods the slightest twist!
1284,IV,With your air indifferent and imperious
1285,IV,"At a stroke our mad poetics to confute--"""
1286,IV,"And--""Are we then so serious?"""

1291,IV,La Figlia Che Piange
1292,IV,
1293,IV,O quam te memorem Virgo...
1294,IV,
1295,IV,
1296,IV,Stand on the highest pavement of the stair--
1297,IV,Lean on a garden urn--
1298,IV,"Weave, weave the sunlight in your hair--"
1299,IV,Clasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise--
1300,IV,Fling them to the ground and turn
1301,IV,With a fugitive resentment in your eyes:
1302,IV,"But weave, weave the sunlight in your hair."
1303,IV,
1304,IV,"So I would have had him leave,"
1305,IV,"So I would have had her stand and grieve,"
1306,IV,So he would have left
1307,IV,"As the soul leaves the body torn and bruised,"
1308,IV,As the mind deserts the body it has used.
1309,IV,I should find
1310,IV,"Some way incomparably light and deft,"
1311,IV,"Some way we both should understand,"
1312,IV,Simple and faithless as a smile and shake of the hand.
1313,IV,
1314,IV,"She turned away, but with the autumn weather"
1315,IV,"Compelled my imagination many days,"
1316,IV,Many days and many hours:
1317,IV,Her hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers.
1318,IV,And I wonder how they should have been together!
1319,IV,I should have lost a gesture and a pose.
1320,IV,Sometimes these cogitations still amaze
1321,IV,The troubled midnight and the noon's repose.
