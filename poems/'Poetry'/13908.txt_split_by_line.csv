179,AT ZEKESBURY.,
180,AT ZEKESBURY.,
181,AT ZEKESBURY.,
182,AT ZEKESBURY.,"The little town, as I recall it, was of just enough dignity and dearth"
183,AT ZEKESBURY.,"of the same to be an ordinary county seat in Indiana--""The Grand Old"
184,AT ZEKESBURY.,"Hoosier State,"" as it was used to being howlingly referred to by the"
185,AT ZEKESBURY.,forensic stump orator from the old stand in the courthouse yard--a
186,AT ZEKESBURY.,political campaign being the wildest delight that Zekesbury might ever
187,AT ZEKESBURY.,hope to call its own.
188,AT ZEKESBURY.,
189,AT ZEKESBURY.,Through years the fitful happenings of the town and its vicinity went
190,AT ZEKESBURY.,"on the same--the same! Annually about one circus ventured in, and"
191,AT ZEKESBURY.,"vanished, and was gone, even as a passing trumpet-blast; the usual"
192,AT ZEKESBURY.,"rainy-season swelled the ""Crick,"" the driftage choking at ""the covered"
193,AT ZEKESBURY.,"bridge,"" and backing water till the old road looked amphibious; and"
194,AT ZEKESBURY.,crowds of curious townsfolk straggled down to look upon the watery
195,AT ZEKESBURY.,"wonder, and lean awe-struck above it, and spit in it, and turn mutely"
196,AT ZEKESBURY.,home again.
197,AT ZEKESBURY.,
198,AT ZEKESBURY.,The usual formula of incidents peculiar to an uneventful town and its
199,AT ZEKESBURY.,"vicinity: The countryman from ""Jessup's Crossing,"" with the cornstalk"
200,AT ZEKESBURY.,"coffin-measure, loped into town, his steaming little"
201,AT ZEKESBURY.,"gray-and-red-flecked ""roadster"" gurgitating, as it were, with that"
202,AT ZEKESBURY.,mysterious utterance that ever has commanded and ever must evoke the
203,AT ZEKESBURY.,wonder and bewilderment of every boy. The small-pox rumor became
204,AT ZEKESBURY.,"prevalent betimes, and the subtle aroma of the assafoetida-bag"
205,AT ZEKESBURY.,"permeated the graded schools ""from turret to foundation-stone;"" the"
206,AT ZEKESBURY.,"still recurring exposÚ of the poor-house management; the farm-hand,"
207,AT ZEKESBURY.,"with the scythe across his shoulder, struck dead by lightning; the"
208,AT ZEKESBURY.,long-drawn quarrel between the rival editors culminating in one of
209,AT ZEKESBURY.,"them assaulting the other with a ""sidestick,"" and the other kicking"
210,AT ZEKESBURY.,"the one down stairs and thenceward _ad libitum;_ the tramp,"
211,AT ZEKESBURY.,"suppositiously stealing a ride, found dead on the railroad; the grand"
212,AT ZEKESBURY.,jury returning a sensational indictment against a bar-tender _non
213,AT ZEKESBURY.,"est_; the Temperance outbreak; the ""Revival;"" the Church Festival; and"
214,AT ZEKESBURY.,"the ""Free Lectures on Phrenology, and Marvels of Mesmerism,"" at the"
215,AT ZEKESBURY.,"town hall. It was during the time of the last-mentioned sensation, and"
216,AT ZEKESBURY.,"directly through this scientific investigation, that I came upon two"
217,AT ZEKESBURY.,of the town's most remarkable characters. And however meager my
218,AT ZEKESBURY.,"outline of them may prove, my material for the sketch is most accurate"
219,AT ZEKESBURY.,"in every detail, and no deviation from the cold facts of the case"
220,AT ZEKESBURY.,shall influence any line of my report.
221,AT ZEKESBURY.,
222,AT ZEKESBURY.,For some years prior to this odd experience I had been connected with
223,AT ZEKESBURY.,a daily paper at the state capitol; and latterly a prolonged session
224,AT ZEKESBURY.,"of the legislature, where I specially reported, having told"
225,AT ZEKESBURY.,"threateningly upon my health, I took both the advantage of a brief"
226,AT ZEKESBURY.,"vacation, and the invitation of a young bachelor Senator, to get out"
227,AT ZEKESBURY.,"of the city for awhile, and bask my respiratory organs in the"
228,AT ZEKESBURY.,revivifying rural air of Zekesbury--the home of my new friend.
229,AT ZEKESBURY.,
230,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""It'll pay you to get out here,"" he said, cordially, meeting me at the"
231,AT ZEKESBURY.,"little station, ""and I'm glad you've come, for you'll find no end of"
232,AT ZEKESBURY.,"odd characters to amuse you."" And under the very pleasant sponsorship"
233,AT ZEKESBURY.,"of my senatorial friend, I was placed at once on genial terms with"
234,AT ZEKESBURY.,half the citizens of the little town--from the shirt-sleeved nabob of
235,AT ZEKESBURY.,the county office to the droll wag of the favorite loafing-place--the
236,AT ZEKESBURY.,"rules and by-laws of which resort, by the way, being rudely charcoaled"
237,AT ZEKESBURY.,"on the wall above the cutter's bench, and somewhat artistically"
238,AT ZEKESBURY.,culminating in an original dialectic legend which ran thus:
239,AT ZEKESBURY.,
240,AT ZEKESBURY.,"F'rinstance, now whar _some_ folks gits"
241,AT ZEKESBURY.,To relyin' on their wits.
242,AT ZEKESBURY.,"Ten to one they git too smart,"
243,AT ZEKESBURY.,And spile it all right at the start!--
244,AT ZEKESBURY.,Feller wants to jest go slow
245,AT ZEKESBURY.,"And do his _thinkin'_ first, you know:----"
246,AT ZEKESBURY.,"_Ef I can't think up somepin' good,_"
247,AT ZEKESBURY.,_I set still and chaw my cood!_
248,AT ZEKESBURY.,
249,AT ZEKESBURY.,"And it was at this inviting rendezvous, two or three evenings"
250,AT ZEKESBURY.,"following my arrival, that the general crowd, acting upon the random"
251,AT ZEKESBURY.,"proposition of one of the boys, rose as a man and wended its hilarious"
252,AT ZEKESBURY.,way to the town hall.
253,AT ZEKESBURY.,
254,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""Phrenology,"" said the little, old, bald-headed lecturer and"
255,AT ZEKESBURY.,"mesmerist, thumbing the egg-shaped head of a young man I remembered to"
256,AT ZEKESBURY.,"have met that afternoon in some law office; ""Phrenology,"" repeated the"
257,AT ZEKESBURY.,"professor--""or rather the _term_ phrenology--is derived from two Greek"
258,AT ZEKESBURY.,words signifying _mind_ and _discourse_; hence we find embodied in
259,AT ZEKESBURY.,"phrenology-proper, the science of intellectual measurement, together"
260,AT ZEKESBURY.,with the capacity of intelligent communication of the varying mental
261,AT ZEKESBURY.,"forces and their flexibilities, etc., &c. The study, then, of"
262,AT ZEKESBURY.,"phrenology is, to wholly simplify it--is, I say, the general"
263,AT ZEKESBURY.,contemplation of the workings of the mind as made manifest through the
264,AT ZEKESBURY.,certain corresponding depressions and protuberances of the human
265,AT ZEKESBURY.,"skull, when, of course, in a healthy state of action and development,"
266,AT ZEKESBURY.,"as we here find the conditions exemplified in the subject before us."""
267,AT ZEKESBURY.,
268,AT ZEKESBURY.,"Here the ""subject"" vaguely smiled."
269,AT ZEKESBURY.,
270,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""You recognize that mug, don't you?"" whispered my friend. ""It's that"
271,AT ZEKESBURY.,"coruscating young ass, you know, Hedrick--in Cummings' office--trying"
272,AT ZEKESBURY.,"to study law and literature at the same time, and tampering with 'The"
273,AT ZEKESBURY.,"Monster that Annually,' don't you know?--where we found the two young"
274,AT ZEKESBURY.,"students scuffling round the office, and smelling of"
275,AT ZEKESBURY.,"peppermint?--Hedrick, you know, and Sweeney. Sweeney, the slim chap,"
276,AT ZEKESBURY.,"with the pallid face, and frog-eyes, and clammy hands! You remember I"
277,AT ZEKESBURY.,"told you 'there was a pair of 'em?' Well, they're up to something here"
278,AT ZEKESBURY.,"to-night. Hedrick, there on the stage in front; and Sweeney--don't you"
279,AT ZEKESBURY.,"see?--with the gang on the rear seats."""
280,AT ZEKESBURY.,
281,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""Phrenology--again,"" continued the lecturer, ""is, we may say, a"
282,AT ZEKESBURY.,"species of mental geography, as it were; which--by a study of the"
283,AT ZEKESBURY.,"skull--leads also to a study of the brain within, even as geology"
284,AT ZEKESBURY.,naturally follows the initial contemplation of the earth's surface.
285,AT ZEKESBURY.,"The brain, thurfur, or intellectual retort, as we may say, natively"
286,AT ZEKESBURY.,exerts a molding influence on the skull contour; thurfur is the expert
287,AT ZEKESBURY.,in phrenology most readily enabled to accurately locate the
288,AT ZEKESBURY.,"multitudinous intellectual forces, and most exactingly estimate, as"
289,AT ZEKESBURY.,"well, the sequent character of each subject submitted to his scrutiny."
290,AT ZEKESBURY.,"As, in the example before us--a young man, doubtless well known in"
291,AT ZEKESBURY.,"your midst, though, I may say, an entire stranger to myself--I venture"
292,AT ZEKESBURY.,"to disclose some characteristic trends and tendencies, as indicated by"
293,AT ZEKESBURY.,"this phrenological depression and development of the skull-proper, as"
294,AT ZEKESBURY.,"later we will show, through the mesmeric condition, the accuracy of"
295,AT ZEKESBURY.,"our mental diagnosis."""
296,AT ZEKESBURY.,
297,AT ZEKESBURY.,Throughout the latter part of this speech my friend nudged me
298,AT ZEKESBURY.,"spasmodically, whispering something which was jostled out of"
299,AT ZEKESBURY.,intelligent utterance by some inward spasm of laughter.
300,AT ZEKESBURY.,
301,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""In this head,"" said the Professor, straddling his malleable fingers"
302,AT ZEKESBURY.,"across the young man's bumpy brow--""In this head we find Ideality"
303,AT ZEKESBURY.,"large--abnormally large, in fact; thurby indicating--taken in"
304,AT ZEKESBURY.,conjunction with a like development of the perceptive
305,AT ZEKESBURY.,"qualities--language following, as well, in the prominent eye--thurby"
306,AT ZEKESBURY.,"indicating, I say, our subject as especially endowed with a love for"
307,AT ZEKESBURY.,the beautiful--the sublime--the elevating--the refined and
308,AT ZEKESBURY.,"delicate--the lofty and superb--in nature, and in all the sublimated"
309,AT ZEKESBURY.,"attributes of the human heart and beatific soul. In fact, we find this"
310,AT ZEKESBURY.,young man possessed of such natural gifts as would befit him for the
311,AT ZEKESBURY.,"exalted career of the sculptor, the actor, the artist, or the"
312,AT ZEKESBURY.,"poet--any ideal calling; in fact, any calling but a practical,"
313,AT ZEKESBURY.,matter-of-fact vocation; though in poetry he would seem to best
314,AT ZEKESBURY.,"succeed."""
315,AT ZEKESBURY.,
316,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""Well,"" said my friend, seriously, ""he's _feeling_ for the boy!"" Then"
317,AT ZEKESBURY.,"laughingly: ""Hedrick _has_ written some rhymes for the county papers,"
318,AT ZEKESBURY.,"and Sweeney once introduced him, at an Old Settlers' Meeting, as 'The"
319,AT ZEKESBURY.,"Best Poet in Center Township,' and never cracked a smile! Always after"
320,AT ZEKESBURY.,"each other that way, but the best friends in the world. _Sweeney's_"
321,AT ZEKESBURY.,strong suit is elocution. He has a native ability that way by no means
322,AT ZEKESBURY.,"ordinary, but even that gift he abuses and distorts simply to produce"
323,AT ZEKESBURY.,"grotesque, and oftentimes ridiculous effects. For instance, nothing"
324,AT ZEKESBURY.,"more delights him than to 'lothfully' consent to answer a request, at"
325,AT ZEKESBURY.,"The Mite Society, some evening, for 'an appropriate selection,' and"
326,AT ZEKESBURY.,"then, with an elaborate introduction of the same, and an exalted"
327,AT ZEKESBURY.,"tribute to the refined genius of the author, proceed with a most"
328,AT ZEKESBURY.,"gruesome rendition of 'Alonzo The Brave and The Fair Imogene,' in a"
329,AT ZEKESBURY.,way to coagulate the blood and curl the hair of his fair listeners
330,AT ZEKESBURY.,"with abject terror. Pale as a corpse, you know, and with that"
331,AT ZEKESBURY.,"cadaverous face, lit with those malignant-looking eyes, his slender"
332,AT ZEKESBURY.,"figure, and his long, thin legs and arms and hands, and his whole"
333,AT ZEKESBURY.,"diabolical talent and adroitness brought into play--why, I want to say"
334,AT ZEKESBURY.,"to you, it's enough to scare 'em to death! Never a smile from him,"
335,AT ZEKESBURY.,"though, till he and Hedrick are safe out into the night again--then,"
336,AT ZEKESBURY.,"of course, they hug each other and howl over it like Modocs! But"
337,AT ZEKESBURY.,"pardon; I'm interrupting the lecture. Listen."""
338,AT ZEKESBURY.,
339,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""A lack of continuity, however,"" continued the Professor, ""and an"
340,AT ZEKESBURY.,"undue love of approbation, would, measurably, at least, tend to retard"
341,AT ZEKESBURY.,the young man's progress toward the consummation of any loftier
342,AT ZEKESBURY.,"ambition, I fear; yet as we have intimated, if the subject were"
343,AT ZEKESBURY.,"appropriately educated to the need's demand, he could doubtless"
344,AT ZEKESBURY.,produce a high order of both prose and poetry--especially the
345,AT ZEKESBURY.,latter--though he could very illy bear being laughed at for his
346,AT ZEKESBURY.,"pains."""
347,AT ZEKESBURY.,
348,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""He's dead wrong there,"" said my friend; ""Hedrick enjoys being laughed"
349,AT ZEKESBURY.,"at; he 's used to it--gets fat on it!"""
350,AT ZEKESBURY.,
351,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""He is fond of his friends,"" continued the Professor ""and the heartier"
352,AT ZEKESBURY.,they are the better; might even be convivially inclined--if so
353,AT ZEKESBURY.,"tempted--but prudent--in a degree,"" loiteringly concluded the speaker,"
354,AT ZEKESBURY.,as though unable to find the exact bump with which to bolster up the
355,AT ZEKESBURY.,last named attribute.
356,AT ZEKESBURY.,
357,AT ZEKESBURY.,"The subject blushed vividly--my friend's right eyelid dropped, and"
358,AT ZEKESBURY.,"there was a noticeable, though elusive sensation throughout the"
359,AT ZEKESBURY.,audience.
360,AT ZEKESBURY.,
361,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""_But!_"" said the Professor, explosively, ""selecting a directly"
362,AT ZEKESBURY.,"opposite subject, in conjunction with the study of the one before us"
363,AT ZEKESBURY.,"[turning to the group at the rear of the stage and beckoning], we may"
364,AT ZEKESBURY.,find a newer interest in the practical comparison of these subjects
365,AT ZEKESBURY.,"side by side."" And the Professor pushed a very pale young man into"
366,AT ZEKESBURY.,position.
367,AT ZEKESBURY.,
368,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""Sweeney!"" whispered my friend, delightedly; ""now look out!"""
369,AT ZEKESBURY.,
370,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""In _this_ subject,"" said the Professor, ""we find the practical"
371,AT ZEKESBURY.,"business head. Square--though small--a trifle light at the base, in"
372,AT ZEKESBURY.,fact; but well balanced at the important points at least; thoughtful
373,AT ZEKESBURY.,"eyes--wide-awake--crafty--quick--restless--a policy eye, though not"
374,AT ZEKESBURY.,"denoting language--unless, perhaps, mere business forms and direct"
375,AT ZEKESBURY.,"statements."""
376,AT ZEKESBURY.,
377,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""Fooled again!"" whispered my friend; ""and I'm afraid the old man will"
378,AT ZEKESBURY.,fail to nest out the fact also that Sweeney is the cold-bloodedest
379,AT ZEKESBURY.,"guyer on the face of the earth, and with more diabolical resources"
380,AT ZEKESBURY.,"than a prosecuting attorney; the Professor ought to know this, too, by"
381,AT ZEKESBURY.,this time--for these same two chaps have been visiting the old man in
382,AT ZEKESBURY.,his room at the hotel;--that's what I was trying to tell you awhile
383,AT ZEKESBURY.,"ago. The old sharp thinks he's 'playing' the boys, is my idea; but"
384,AT ZEKESBURY.,"it's the other way, or I lose my guess."""
385,AT ZEKESBURY.,
386,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""Now, under the mesmeric influence--if the two subjects will consent"
387,AT ZEKESBURY.,"to its administration,"" said the Professor, after some further tedious"
388,AT ZEKESBURY.,"preamble, ""we may at once determine the fact of my assertions, as will"
389,AT ZEKESBURY.,"be proved by their action while in this peculiar state."" Here some"
390,AT ZEKESBURY.,"apparent remonstrance was met with from both subjects, though amicably"
391,AT ZEKESBURY.,overcome by the Professor first manipulating the stolid brow and
392,AT ZEKESBURY.,pallid front of the imperturbable Sweeney--after which the same
393,AT ZEKESBURY.,mysterious ordeal was lothfully submitted to by Hedrick--though a
394,AT ZEKESBURY.,noticeably longer time was consumed in securing his final loss of
395,AT ZEKESBURY.,"self-control. At last, however, this curious phenomenon was presented,"
396,AT ZEKESBURY.,"and there before us stood the two swaying figures, the heads dropped"
397,AT ZEKESBURY.,"back, the lifted hands, with thumb and finger-tips pressed lightly"
398,AT ZEKESBURY.,"together, the eyelids languid and half closed, and the features, in"
399,AT ZEKESBURY.,"appearance, wan and humid."
400,AT ZEKESBURY.,
401,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""Now, sir!"" said the Professor, leading the limp Sweeney forward, and"
402,AT ZEKESBURY.,"addressing him in a quick, sharp tone of voice.--""Now, sir, you are a"
403,AT ZEKESBURY.,"great contractor--own large factories, and with untold business"
404,AT ZEKESBURY.,interests. Just look out there! [pointing out across the expectant
405,AT ZEKESBURY.,"audience] look there, and see the countless minions toiling servilely"
406,AT ZEKESBURY.,at your dread mandates. And yet--ha! ha! See! see!--They recognize the
407,AT ZEKESBURY.,avaricious greed that would thus grind them in the very dust; they
408,AT ZEKESBURY.,"see, alas! they see themselves half-clothed--half-fed, that you may"
409,AT ZEKESBURY.,"glut your coffers. Half-starved, they listen to the wail of wife and"
410,AT ZEKESBURY.,"babe, and, with eyes upraised in prayer, they see _you_ rolling by in"
411,AT ZEKESBURY.,"gilded coach, and swathed in silk attire. But--ha! again! Look--look!"
412,AT ZEKESBURY.,they are rising in revolt against you! Speak to them before too late!
413,AT ZEKESBURY.,Appeal to them--quell them with the promise of the just advance of
414,AT ZEKESBURY.,"wages they demand!"""
415,AT ZEKESBURY.,
416,AT ZEKESBURY.,The limp figure of Sweeney took on something of a stately and majestic
417,AT ZEKESBURY.,"air. With a graceful and commanding gesture of the hand, he advanced a"
418,AT ZEKESBURY.,"step or two; then, after a pause of some seconds duration, in which"
419,AT ZEKESBURY.,"the lifted face grew paler, as it seemed, and the eyes a denser black,"
420,AT ZEKESBURY.,he said:
421,AT ZEKESBURY.,
422,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""But yesterday"
423,AT ZEKESBURY.,I looked away
424,AT ZEKESBURY.,"O'er happy lands, where sunshine lay"
425,AT ZEKESBURY.,"In golden blots,"
426,AT ZEKESBURY.,Inlaid with spots
427,AT ZEKESBURY.,"Of shade and wild forget-me-nots."""
428,AT ZEKESBURY.,
429,AT ZEKESBURY.,"The voice was low, but clear, and ever musical. The Professor started"
430,AT ZEKESBURY.,"at the strange utterance, looked extremely confused, and, as the"
431,AT ZEKESBURY.,"boisterous crowd cried ""Hear, hear!"" he motioned the subject to"
432,AT ZEKESBURY.,"continue, with some gasping comment interjected, which, if audible,"
433,AT ZEKESBURY.,"would have run thus: ""My God! It's an inspirational poem!"""
434,AT ZEKESBURY.,
435,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""My head was fair"
436,AT ZEKESBURY.,"With flaxen hair--"""
437,AT ZEKESBURY.,
438,AT ZEKESBURY.,resumed the subject.
439,AT ZEKESBURY.,
440,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""Yoop-ee!"" yelled an irreverent auditor."
441,AT ZEKESBURY.,
442,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""Silence! silence!"" commanded the excited Professor in a hoarse"
443,AT ZEKESBURY.,"whisper; then, turning enthusiastically to the subject--""Go on, young"
444,AT ZEKESBURY.,"man! Go on!--'_Thy head-was fair-with flaxen hair_--'"""
445,AT ZEKESBURY.,
446,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""My head was fair"
447,AT ZEKESBURY.,"With flaxen hair,"
448,AT ZEKESBURY.,"And fragrant breezes, faint and rare,"
449,AT ZEKESBURY.,And warm with drouth
450,AT ZEKESBURY.,"From out the south,"
451,AT ZEKESBURY.,"Blew all my curls across my mouth."""
452,AT ZEKESBURY.,
453,AT ZEKESBURY.,"The speaker's voice, exquisitely modulated, yet resonant as the twang"
454,AT ZEKESBURY.,"of a harp, now seemed of itself to draw and hold each listener; while"
455,AT ZEKESBURY.,a certain extravagance of gesticulation--a fantastic movement of both
456,AT ZEKESBURY.,form and feature--seemed very near akin to fascination. And so flowed
457,AT ZEKESBURY.,on the curious utterance:
458,AT ZEKESBURY.,
459,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""And, cool and sweet,"
460,AT ZEKESBURY.,My naked feet
461,AT ZEKESBURY.,Found dewy pathways through the wheat;
462,AT ZEKESBURY.,And out again
463,AT ZEKESBURY.,"Where, down the lane,"
464,AT ZEKESBURY.,"The dust was dimpled with the rain."""
465,AT ZEKESBURY.,
466,AT ZEKESBURY.,In the pause following there was a breathlessness almost painful. The
467,AT ZEKESBURY.,poem went on:
468,AT ZEKESBURY.,
469,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""But yesterday"
470,AT ZEKESBURY.,I heard the lay
471,AT ZEKESBURY.,"Of summer birds, when I, as they"
472,AT ZEKESBURY.,"With breast and wing,"
473,AT ZEKESBURY.,All quivering
474,AT ZEKESBURY.,"With life and love, could only sing."
475,AT ZEKESBURY.,
476,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""My head was leant,"
477,AT ZEKESBURY.,"Where, with it, blent"
478,AT ZEKESBURY.,"A maiden's, o'er her instrument;"
479,AT ZEKESBURY.,"While all the night,"
480,AT ZEKESBURY.,"From vale to height,"
481,AT ZEKESBURY.,Was filled with echoes of delight.
482,AT ZEKESBURY.,
483,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""And all our dreams"
484,AT ZEKESBURY.,Were lit with gleams
485,AT ZEKESBURY.,"Of that lost land of reedy streams,"
486,AT ZEKESBURY.,Along whose brim
487,AT ZEKESBURY.,Forever swim
488,AT ZEKESBURY.,"Pan's lilies, laughing up at him."""
489,AT ZEKESBURY.,
490,AT ZEKESBURY.,And still the inspired singer held rapt sway.
491,AT ZEKESBURY.,
492,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""It is wonderful!"" I whispered, under breath."
493,AT ZEKESBURY.,
494,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""Of course it is!"" answered my friend. ""But listen; there is more:"""
495,AT ZEKESBURY.,
496,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""But yesterday!..."
497,AT ZEKESBURY.,"O blooms of May,"
498,AT ZEKESBURY.,And summer roses--Where-away?
499,AT ZEKESBURY.,O stars above;
500,AT ZEKESBURY.,"And lips of love,"
501,AT ZEKESBURY.,And all the honeyed sweets thereof!
502,AT ZEKESBURY.,
503,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""O lad and lass."
504,AT ZEKESBURY.,"And orchard-pass,"
505,AT ZEKESBURY.,"And briared lane, and daisied grass!"
506,AT ZEKESBURY.,"O gleam and gloom,"
507,AT ZEKESBURY.,"And woodland bloom,"
508,AT ZEKESBURY.,And breezy breaths of all perfume!--
509,AT ZEKESBURY.,
510,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""No more for me"
511,AT ZEKESBURY.,Or mine shall be
512,AT ZEKESBURY.,"Thy raptures--save in memory,--"
513,AT ZEKESBURY.,No more--no more--
514,AT ZEKESBURY.,Till through the Door
515,AT ZEKESBURY.,"Of Glory gleam the days of yore."""
516,AT ZEKESBURY.,
517,AT ZEKESBURY.,"This was the evident conclusion of the remarkable utterance, and the"
518,AT ZEKESBURY.,Professor was impetuously fluttering his hands about the subject's
519,AT ZEKESBURY.,"upward-staring eyes, stroking his temples, and snapping his fingers in"
520,AT ZEKESBURY.,his face.
521,AT ZEKESBURY.,
522,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""Well,"" said Sweeney, as he stood suddenly awakened, and grinning in"
523,AT ZEKESBURY.,"an idiotic way, ""how did the old thing work?"" And it was in the"
524,AT ZEKESBURY.,"consequent hilarity and loud and long applause, perhaps, that the"
525,AT ZEKESBURY.,Professor was relieved from the explanation of this rather astounding
526,AT ZEKESBURY.,"phenomenon of the idealistic workings of a purely practical brain--or,"
527,AT ZEKESBURY.,"as my impious friend scoffed the incongruity later, in a particularly"
528,AT ZEKESBURY.,"withering allusion, as the ""blank-blanked fallacy, don't you know, of"
529,AT ZEKESBURY.,"staying the hunger of a howling mob by feeding 'em on Spring poetry!"""
530,AT ZEKESBURY.,
531,AT ZEKESBURY.,The tumult of the audience did not cease even with the retirement of
532,AT ZEKESBURY.,"Sweeney, and cries of ""Hedrick! Hedrick!"" only subsided with the"
533,AT ZEKESBURY.,Professor's high-keyed announcement that the subject was even then
534,AT ZEKESBURY.,"endeavoring to make himself heard, but could not until utter quiet was"
535,AT ZEKESBURY.,"restored, adding the further appeal that the young man had already"
536,AT ZEKESBURY.,"been a long time under the mesmeric spell, and ought not be so"
537,AT ZEKESBURY.,"detained for an unnecessary period. ""See,"" he concluded, with an"
538,AT ZEKESBURY.,"assuring wave of the hand toward the subject, ""see; he is about to"
539,AT ZEKESBURY.,"address you. Now, quiet!--utter quiet, if you please!"""
540,AT ZEKESBURY.,
541,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""Great heavens!"" exclaimed my friend, stiflingly; ""Just look at the"
542,AT ZEKESBURY.,boy! Get onto that position for a poet! Even Sweeney has fled from the
543,AT ZEKESBURY.,"sight of him!"""
544,AT ZEKESBURY.,
545,AT ZEKESBURY.,"And truly, too, it was a grotesque pose the young man had assumed; not"
546,AT ZEKESBURY.,"wholly ridiculous either, since the dwarfed position he had settled"
547,AT ZEKESBURY.,into seemed more a genuine physical condition than an affected one.
548,AT ZEKESBURY.,"The head, back-tilted, and sunk between the shoulders, looked"
549,AT ZEKESBURY.,"abnormally large, while the features of the face appeared peculiarly"
550,AT ZEKESBURY.,"child-like--especially the eyes--wakeful and wide apart, and very"
551,AT ZEKESBURY.,"bright, yet very mild and very artless; and the drawn and cramped"
552,AT ZEKESBURY.,"outline of the legs and feet, and of the arms and hands, even to the"
553,AT ZEKESBURY.,"shrunken, slender-looking fingers, all combined to most strikingly"
554,AT ZEKESBURY.,convey to the pained senses the fragile frame and pixey figure of some
555,AT ZEKESBURY.,"pitiably afflicted child, unconscious altogether of the pathos of its"
556,AT ZEKESBURY.,own deformity.
557,AT ZEKESBURY.,
558,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""Now, mark the kuss, Horatio!"" gasped my friend."
559,AT ZEKESBURY.,
560,AT ZEKESBURY.,"At first the speaker's voice came very low, and somewhat piping, too,"
561,AT ZEKESBURY.,"and broken--an eerie sort of voice it was, of brittle and erratic"
562,AT ZEKESBURY.,_timbre_ and undulant inflection. Yet it was beautiful. It had the
563,AT ZEKESBURY.,"ring of childhood in it, though the ring was not pure golden, and at"
564,AT ZEKESBURY.,times fell echoless. The _spirit_ of its utterance was always clear
565,AT ZEKESBURY.,"and pure and crisp and cheery as the twitter of a bird, and yet"
566,AT ZEKESBURY.,forever ran an undercadence through it like a low-pleading prayer.
567,AT ZEKESBURY.,"Half garrulously, and like a shallow brook might brawl across a shelvy"
568,AT ZEKESBURY.,"bottom, the rhythmic little changeling thus began:"

570,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""I'm thist a little crippled boy, an' never goin' to grow"

578,AT ZEKESBURY.,
579,AT ZEKESBURY.,A few titterings from the younger people in the audience marked the
580,AT ZEKESBURY.,"opening stanza, while a certain restlessness, and a changing to more"
581,AT ZEKESBURY.,"attentive positions seemed the general tendency. The old Professor, in"
582,AT ZEKESBURY.,"the meantime, had sunk into one of the empty chairs. The speaker went"
583,AT ZEKESBURY.,on with more gaiety:
584,AT ZEKESBURY.,
585,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""I'm nine years old! An' you can't guess how much I weigh, I bet!--"
586,AT ZEKESBURY.,Last birthday I weighed thirty-three!--An' I weigh thirty yet!
587,AT ZEKESBURY.,I'm awful little far my size--I'm purt' nigh littler 'an

589,AT ZEKESBURY.,"An' Doc one time he laughed an' said: 'I 'spect, first thing you"

591,AT ZEKESBURY.,You'll have a little spike-tail coat an' travel with a show!'
592,AT ZEKESBURY.,An' nen I laughed--till I looked round an' Aunty was a-cryin'--
593,AT ZEKESBURY.,"Sometimes she acts like that, 'cause I got 'Curv'ture of the"
594,AT ZEKESBURY.,"Spine!'"""
595,AT ZEKESBURY.,
596,AT ZEKESBURY.,"Just in front of me a great broad-shouldered countryman, with a rainy"
597,AT ZEKESBURY.,"smell in his cumbrous overcoat, cleared his throat vehemently, looked"
598,AT ZEKESBURY.,"startled at the sound, and again settled forward, his weedy chin"
599,AT ZEKESBURY.,resting on the knuckles of his hands as they tightly clutched the seat
600,AT ZEKESBURY.,before him. And it was like being taken into a childish confidence as
601,AT ZEKESBURY.,the quaint speech continued:
602,AT ZEKESBURY.,
603,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""I set--while Aunty's washin'--on my little long-leg stool,"
604,AT ZEKESBURY.,An' watch the little boys an' girls 'a-skippin' by to school;
605,AT ZEKESBURY.,"An' I peck on the winder, an' holler out an' say:"
606,AT ZEKESBURY.,'Who wants to fight The Little Man 'at dares you all to-day?'
607,AT ZEKESBURY.,"An' nen the boys climbs on the fence, an' little girls peeks"
608,AT ZEKESBURY.,"through,"

611,AT ZEKESBURY.,"An' nen they yell, an' shake their fist at me, like I shake mine--"
612,AT ZEKESBURY.,"They're thist in fun, you know, 'cause I got 'Curv'ture of the"

614,AT ZEKESBURY.,
615,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""Well,"" whispered my friend, with rather odd irrelevance, I thought,"
616,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""of course you see through the scheme of the fellows by this time,"
617,AT ZEKESBURY.,"don't you?"""
618,AT ZEKESBURY.,
619,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""I see nothing,"" said I, most earnestly, ""but a poor little wisp of a"
620,AT ZEKESBURY.,"child that makes me love him so I dare not think of his dying soon, as"
621,AT ZEKESBURY.,"he surely must! There; listen!"" And the plaintive gaiety of the homely"
622,AT ZEKESBURY.,poem ran on:
623,AT ZEKESBURY.,
624,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""At evening, when the ironin's done, an' Aunty's fixed the fire,"
625,AT ZEKESBURY.,"An' filled an' lit the lamp, an' trimmed the wick an' turned it"
626,AT ZEKESBURY.,"higher,"
627,AT ZEKESBURY.,"An' fetched the wood all in far night, an' locked the kitchen door,"
628,AT ZEKESBURY.,An' stuffed the ole crack where the wind blows in up through the
629,AT ZEKESBURY.,floor--
630,AT ZEKESBURY.,"She sets the kittle on the coals, an' biles an' makes the tea,"
631,AT ZEKESBURY.,"An' fries the liver an' the mush, an' cooks a egg far me;"
632,AT ZEKESBURY.,An' sometimes--when I cough so hard--her elderberry wine
633,AT ZEKESBURY.,"Don't go so bad far little boys with 'Curv'ture of the Spine!'"""
634,AT ZEKESBURY.,
635,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""Look!"" whispered my friend, touching me with his elbow. ""Look at the"
636,AT ZEKESBURY.,"Professor!"""
637,AT ZEKESBURY.,
638,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""Look at everybody!"" said I. And the artless little voice went on"
639,AT ZEKESBURY.,again half quaveringly:
640,AT ZEKESBURY.,
641,AT ZEKESBURY.,"""But Aunty's all so childish-like on my account, you see,"
642,AT ZEKESBURY.,I'm 'most afeared she'll be took down--an' 'at's what bothers
643,AT ZEKESBURY.,_me!_--
644,AT ZEKESBURY.,"'Cause ef my good ole Aunty ever would git sick an' die,"
645,AT ZEKESBURY.,"I don't know what she'd do in Heaven--till _I_ come, by an' by:--"
646,AT ZEKESBURY.,"Far she's so ust to all my ways, an' ever'thing, you know,"
647,AT ZEKESBURY.,"An' no one there like me, to nurse, an' worry over so!--"
648,AT ZEKESBURY.,'Cause all the little childerns there's so straight an' strong an'
649,AT ZEKESBURY.,"fine,"
650,AT ZEKESBURY.,"They's nary angel 'bout the place with 'Curv'ture of the Spine!'"""
651,AT ZEKESBURY.,
652,AT ZEKESBURY.,The old Professor's face was in his handkerchief; so was my friend's
653,AT ZEKESBURY.,"in his; and so was mine in mine, as even now my pen drops and I reach"
654,AT ZEKESBURY.,for it again.
655,AT ZEKESBURY.,
656,AT ZEKESBURY.,I half regret joining the mad party that had gathered an hour later in
657,AT ZEKESBURY.,the old law-office where these two graceless characters held almost
658,AT ZEKESBURY.,"nightly revel, the instigators and conniving hosts of a reputed"
659,AT ZEKESBURY.,"banquet whose _menu's_ range confined itself to herrings, or ""blind"
660,AT ZEKESBURY.,"robins,"" dried beef, and cheese, with crackers, gingerbread, and"

666,AT ZEKESBURY.,"Still glowing in a heart of ruby."""
667,AT ZEKESBURY.,
668,AT ZEKESBURY.,But the affair was memorable. The old Professor was himself lured into
669,AT ZEKESBURY.,"it, and loudest in his praise of Hedrick's realistic art; and I yet"
670,AT ZEKESBURY.,"recall him at the orgie's height, excitedly repulsing the continued"

672,AT ZEKESBURY.,contending against the old man's fulsome praise of his more fortunate
673,AT ZEKESBURY.,"rival, at last openly declared that Hedrick was _not_ a poet, _not_ a"
674,AT ZEKESBURY.,"genius, and in no way worthy to be classed in the same breath with"
675,AT ZEKESBURY.,"_himself_--""the gifted but unfortunate _Sweeney_, sir--the"

1189,MRS. MILLER,
1190,MRS. MILLER,"John B. McKinney, Attorney and Counselor at Law, as his sign read,"
1191,MRS. MILLER,"was, for many reasons, a fortunate man. For many other reasons he was"
1192,MRS. MILLER,"not. He was chiefly fortunate in being, as certain opponents often"
1193,MRS. MILLER,"strove to witheringly designate him, ""the son of his father,"" since"
1194,MRS. MILLER,"that sound old gentleman was the wealthiest farmer in that section,"
1195,MRS. MILLER,"with but one son and heir to, in time, supplant him in the role of"
1196,MRS. MILLER,"""county god,"" and haply perpetuate the prouder title of ""the biggest"
1197,MRS. MILLER,"tax-payer on the assessment list."" And this fact, too, fortunate as it"
1198,MRS. MILLER,"would seem, was doubtless the indirect occasion of a liberal"
1199,MRS. MILLER,percentage of all John's misfortunes. From his earliest school-days in
1200,MRS. MILLER,"the little town, up to his tardy graduation from a distant college,"
1201,MRS. MILLER,"the influence of his father's wealth invited his procrastination,"
1202,MRS. MILLER,"humored its results, encouraged the laxity of his ambition, ""and even"
1203,MRS. MILLER,"now,"" as John used, in bitter irony, to put it, ""it is aiding and"
1204,MRS. MILLER,"abetting me in the ostensible practice of my chosen profession, a"
1205,MRS. MILLER,"listless, aimless undetermined man of forty, and a confirmed bachelor"
1206,MRS. MILLER,"at that!"" At the utterance of this self-depreciating statement, John"
1207,MRS. MILLER,"generally jerked his legs down from the top of his desk; and, rising"
1208,MRS. MILLER,"and kicking his chair back to the wall, he would stump around his"
1209,MRS. MILLER,littered office till the manilla carpet steamed with dust. Then he
1210,MRS. MILLER,"would wildly break away, seeking refuge either in the open street, or"
1211,MRS. MILLER,"in his room at the old-time tavern, The Eagle House, ""where,"" he would"
1212,MRS. MILLER,"say, ""I have lodged and boarded, I do solemnly asseverate, for a long,"
1213,MRS. MILLER,"unbroken, middle-aged eternity of ten years, and can yet assert, in"
1214,MRS. MILLER,"the words of the more fortunately-dying Webster, that 'I still live!'"""
1215,MRS. MILLER,
1216,MRS. MILLER,"Extravagantly satirical as he was at times, John had always an"
1217,MRS. MILLER,indefinable drollery about him that made him agreeable company to his
1218,MRS. MILLER,"friends, at least; and such an admiring friend he had constantly at"
1219,MRS. MILLER,hand in the person of Bert Haines. Both were Bohemians in natural
1220,MRS. MILLER,"tendency, and, though John was far in Bert's advance in point of age,"
1221,MRS. MILLER,"he found the young man ""just the kind of a fellow to have around;"""
1222,MRS. MILLER,"while Bert, in turn, held his senior in profound esteem--looked up to"
1223,MRS. MILLER,"him, in fact, and in even his eccentricities strove to pattern after"
1224,MRS. MILLER,"him. And so it was, when summer days were dull and tedious, these two"
1225,MRS. MILLER,could muse and doze the hours away together; and when the nights were
1226,MRS. MILLER,"long, and dark, and deep, and beautiful, they could drift out in the"
1227,MRS. MILLER,"noon-light of the stars, and with ""the soft complaining flute"" and"
1228,MRS. MILLER,"""warbling lute,"" ""lay the pipes,"" as John would say, for their"
1229,MRS. MILLER,enduring popularity with the girls! And it was immediately subsequent
1230,MRS. MILLER,"to one of these romantic excursions, when the belated pair, at two"
1231,MRS. MILLER,"o'clock in the morning, had skulked up a side stairway of the old"
1232,MRS. MILLER,"hotel, and gained John's room, with nothing more serious happening"
1233,MRS. MILLER,"than Bert falling over a trunk and smashing his guitar,--just after"
1234,MRS. MILLER,"such a night of romance and adventure it was that, in the seclusion of"
1235,MRS. MILLER,"John's room, Bert had something of especial import to communicate."
1236,MRS. MILLER,
1237,MRS. MILLER,"""Mack,"" he said, as that worthy anathematized a spiteful match, and"
1238,MRS. MILLER,then sucked his finger.
1239,MRS. MILLER,
1240,MRS. MILLER,"""Blast the all-fired old torch!"" said John, wrestling with the"
1241,MRS. MILLER,"lamp-flue, and turning on a welcome flame at last. ""Well, you said"
1242,MRS. MILLER,"'Mack!' Why don't you go on? And don't bawl at the top of your lungs,"
1243,MRS. MILLER,either. You've already succeeded in waking every boarder in the house
1244,MRS. MILLER,"with that guitar, and you want to make amends now by letting them go"
1245,MRS. MILLER,"to sleep again!"""
1246,MRS. MILLER,
1247,MRS. MILLER,"""But my dear fellow,"" said Bert, with forced calmness, ""you're the"
1248,MRS. MILLER,"fellow that's making all the noise--and--"""
1249,MRS. MILLER,
1250,MRS. MILLER,"""Why, you howling dervish!"" interrupted John, with a feigned air of"
1251,MRS. MILLER,"pleased surprise and admiration. ""But let's drop controversy. Throw"
1252,MRS. MILLER,"the fragments of your guitar in the wood-box there, and proceed with"
1253,MRS. MILLER,"the opening proposition."""
1254,MRS. MILLER,
1255,MRS. MILLER,"""What I was going to say was this,"" said Bert, with a half-desperate"
1256,MRS. MILLER,"enunciation; ""I'm getting tired of this way of living--clean,"
1257,MRS. MILLER,"dead-tired, and fagged out, and sick of the whole artificial"
1258,MRS. MILLER,"business!"""
1259,MRS. MILLER,
1260,MRS. MILLER,"""Oh, yes!"" exclaimed John, with a towering disdain, ""you needn't go"
1261,MRS. MILLER,any further! I know just what malady is throttling you. It's
1262,MRS. MILLER,"reform--reform! You're going to 'turn over a new leaf,' and all that,"
1263,MRS. MILLER,"and sign the pledge, and quit cigars, and go to work, and pay your"
1264,MRS. MILLER,"debts, and gravitate back into Sunday-School, where you can make love"
1265,MRS. MILLER,"to the preacher's daughter under the guise of religion, and desecrate"
1266,MRS. MILLER,the sanctity of the innermost pale of the church by confessions at
1267,MRS. MILLER,"Class of your 'thorough conversion!' Oh, you're going to--"""
1268,MRS. MILLER,
1269,MRS. MILLER,"""No, but I'm going to do nothing of the sort,"" interrupted Bert,"
1270,MRS. MILLER,"resentfully. ""What I mean--if you'll let me finish--is, I'm getting"
1271,MRS. MILLER,too old to be eternally undignifying myself with this 'singing of
1272,MRS. MILLER,"midnight strains under Bonnybell's window panes,' and too old to be"
1273,MRS. MILLER,keeping myself in constant humiliation and expense by the borrowing
1274,MRS. MILLER,"and stringing up of old guitars, together with the breakage of the"
1275,MRS. MILLER,"same, and the general wear-and-tear on a constitution that is slowly"
1276,MRS. MILLER,being sapped to its foundations by exposure in the night-air and the
1277,MRS. MILLER,"dew."" ""And while you receive no further compensation in return,"" said"
1278,MRS. MILLER,"John, ""than, perhaps, the coy turning up of a lamp at an upper"
1279,MRS. MILLER,casement where the jasmine climbs; or an exasperating patter of
1280,MRS. MILLER,invisible palms; or a huge dank wedge of fruit-cake shoved at you by
1281,MRS. MILLER,"the old man, through a crack in the door."""
1282,MRS. MILLER,
1283,MRS. MILLER,"""Yes, and I'm going to have my just reward, is what I mean,"" said"
1284,MRS. MILLER,"Bert, ""and exchange the lover's life for the benedict's. Going to hunt"
1285,MRS. MILLER,"out a good, sensible girl and marry her."" And as the young man"
1286,MRS. MILLER,concluded this desperate avowal he jerked the bow of his cravat into a
1287,MRS. MILLER,"hard knot, kicked his hat under the bed, and threw himself on the sofa"
1288,MRS. MILLER,like an old suit.
1289,MRS. MILLER,
1290,MRS. MILLER,"John stared at him with absolute compassion. ""Poor devil,"" he said,"
1291,MRS. MILLER,"half musingly, ""I know just how he feels--"
1292,MRS. MILLER,
1293,MRS. MILLER,"'Ring in the wind his wedding chimes,"

1300,MRS. MILLER,
1301,MRS. MILLER,"""Then you 'let up' on that suicidal talk of marrying,"" replied John,"

1304,MRS. MILLER,"and John glanced at himself in the glass with a feeble pride, noting"

1308,MRS. MILLER,"don't you know; as young in society, for the matter of that, as"
1309,MRS. MILLER,yourself! And this is just the reason why I don't want you to blight
1310,MRS. MILLER,every prospect in your life by marrying at your age--especially a
1311,MRS. MILLER,"woman--I mean the kind of woman you'd be sure to fancy at your age."""
1312,MRS. MILLER,
1313,MRS. MILLER,"""Didn't I say 'a good, sensible girl' was the kind I had selected?"""
1314,MRS. MILLER,Bert remonstrated.

1316,MRS. MILLER,"""Oh!"" exclaimed John, ""you've selected her, then?--and without one"

1319,MRS. MILLER,"""Well, hang it all!"" said Bert, impatiently; ""I knew how _you_ were,"

1322,MRS. MILLER,"capricious in youthful frivolties--should beat, in manhood, loyal to"

1324,MRS. MILLER,
1325,MRS. MILLER,"""Go it! Fire away! Farewell, vain world!"" exclaimed the excited"
1326,MRS. MILLER,"John.--""Trade your soul off for a pair of ear-bobs and a"

1335,MRS. MILLER,when you _do_ come--'cause this old catafalque-of-a-bed is just about
1336,MRS. MILLER,as narrow as your views of single blessedness! Peace! Not another

1338,MRS. MILLER,"rest!"" And very truly he spoke."
1339,MRS. MILLER,
1340,MRS. MILLER,"It was a bright morning when the slothful John was aroused by a long,"
1341,MRS. MILLER,vociferous pounding on the door. He started up in bed to find himself
1342,MRS. MILLER,alone--the victim of his wrathful irony having evidently risen and
1343,MRS. MILLER,"fled away while his pitiless tormentor slept--""Doubtless to at once"
1344,MRS. MILLER,accomplish that nefarious intent as set forth by his unblushing
1345,MRS. MILLER,"confession of last night,"" mused the miserable John. And he ground his"
1346,MRS. MILLER,"fingers in the corners of his swollen eyes, and leered grimly in the"
1347,MRS. MILLER,"glass at the feverish orbs, blood-shotten, blurred and aching."
1348,MRS. MILLER,
1349,MRS. MILLER,The pounding on the door continued. John looked at his watch; it was
1350,MRS. MILLER,only 8 o'clock.
1351,MRS. MILLER,
1352,MRS. MILLER,"""Hi, there!"" he called viciously. ""What do you mean, anyhow?"" he went"

1354,MRS. MILLER,"just dropping into his first sleep?"""
1355,MRS. MILLER,
1356,MRS. MILLER,"""I mean that you're going to get up; that's what!"" replied a firm"
1357,MRS. MILLER,"female voice. ""It's 8 o'clock, and I want to put your room in order;"
1358,MRS. MILLER,"and I'm not going to wait all day about it, either! Get up and go down"
1359,MRS. MILLER,"to your breakfast, and let me have the room!"" And the clamor at the"
1360,MRS. MILLER,door was industriously renewed.
1361,MRS. MILLER,
1362,MRS. MILLER,"""Say!"" called John, querulously, hurrying on his clothes, ""Say! you!"""
1363,MRS. MILLER,
1364,MRS. MILLER,"""There's no 'say' about it!"" responded the determined voice: ""I've"
1365,MRS. MILLER,"heard about you and your ways around this house, and I'm not going to"
1366,MRS. MILLER,put up with it! You'll not lie in bed till high noon when I've got to
1367,MRS. MILLER,"keep your room in proper order!"""
1368,MRS. MILLER,
1369,MRS. MILLER,"""Oh ho!"" bawled John, intelligently: ""reckon you're the new invasion"
1370,MRS. MILLER,here? Doubtless you're the girl that's been hanging up the new
1371,MRS. MILLER,"window-blinds that won't roll, and disguising the pillows with clean"
1372,MRS. MILLER,"slips, and 'hennin' round among my books and papers on the table here,"
1373,MRS. MILLER,and ageing me generally till I don't know my own handwriting by the
1374,MRS. MILLER,"time I find it! Oh, yes! you're going to revolutionize things here;"
1375,MRS. MILLER,"you're going to introduce promptness, and system, and order. See"
1376,MRS. MILLER,you've even filled the wash-pitcher and tucked two starched towels
1377,MRS. MILLER,"through the handle. Haven't got any tin towels, have you? I rather"
1378,MRS. MILLER,"like this new soap, too! So solid and durable, you know; warranted not"
1379,MRS. MILLER,"to raise a lather. Might as well wash one's hands with a door-knob!"""
1380,MRS. MILLER,"And as John's voice grumbled away into the sullen silence again, the"
1381,MRS. MILLER,"determined voice without responded: ""Oh, you can growl away to your"
1382,MRS. MILLER,"heart's content, Mr. McKinney, but I want you to distinctly understand"
1383,MRS. MILLER,"that I'm not going to humor you in any of your old bachelor,"
1384,MRS. MILLER,"sluggardly, slovenly ways, and whims and notions. And I want you to"
1385,MRS. MILLER,"understand, too, that I'm not hired help in this house, nor a"
1386,MRS. MILLER,"chambermaid, nor anything of the kind. I'm the landlady here; and I'll"
1387,MRS. MILLER,"give you just ten minutes more to get down to your breakfast, or"
1388,MRS. MILLER,"you'll not get any--that's all!"" And as the reversed cuff John was in"
1389,MRS. MILLER,"the act of buttoning slid from his wrist and rolled under the dresser,"
1390,MRS. MILLER,"he heard a stiff rustling of starched muslin flouncing past the door,"
1391,MRS. MILLER,and the quick italicized patter of determined gaiters down the hall.
1392,MRS. MILLER,
1393,MRS. MILLER,"""Look here,"" said John to the bright-faced boy in the hotel office, a"
1394,MRS. MILLER,"half hour later. ""It seems the house here's been changing hands"
1395,MRS. MILLER,"again."""
1396,MRS. MILLER,
1397,MRS. MILLER,"""Yes, sir,"" said the boy, closing the cigar case, and handing him a"
1398,MRS. MILLER,"lighted match. ""Well, the new landlord, whoever he is,"" continued"
1399,MRS. MILLER,"John, patronizingly, ""is a good one. Leastwise, he knows what's good"
1400,MRS. MILLER,"to eat, and how to serve it."""
1401,MRS. MILLER,
1402,MRS. MILLER,"The boy laughed timidly,--""It aint a landlord,' though--it's a"
1403,MRS. MILLER,"landlady; it's my mother."""
1404,MRS. MILLER,
1405,MRS. MILLER,"""Ah,"" said John, dallying with the change the boy had pushed toward"
1406,MRS. MILLER,"him. ""Your mother, eh?"" And where's your father?"""
1407,MRS. MILLER,
1408,MRS. MILLER,"""He's dead,"" said the boy."
1409,MRS. MILLER,
1410,MRS. MILLER,"""And what's this for?"" abruptly asked John, examining his change."
1411,MRS. MILLER,
1412,MRS. MILLER,"""That's your change,"" said the boy: ""You got three for a quarter, and"
1413,MRS. MILLER,"gave me a half."""
1414,MRS. MILLER,
1415,MRS. MILLER,"""Well, _you_ just keep it,"" said John, sliding back the change. ""It's"
1416,MRS. MILLER,"for good luck, you know, my boy. Same as drinking your long life and"
1417,MRS. MILLER,"prosperity. And, Oh yes, by the way, you may tell your mother I'll"
1418,MRS. MILLER,"have a friend to dinner with me to-day."""
1419,MRS. MILLER,
1420,MRS. MILLER,"""Yes, sir, and thank you, sir,"" said the beaming boy."
1421,MRS. MILLER,
1422,MRS. MILLER,"""Handsome boy!"" mused John, as he walked down street. ""Takes that from"
1423,MRS. MILLER,"his father, though, I'll wager my existence!"""
1424,MRS. MILLER,
1425,MRS. MILLER,Upon his office desk John found a hastily written note. It was
1426,MRS. MILLER,addressed in the well-known hand of his old chum. He eyed the missive
1427,MRS. MILLER,"apprehensively, and there was a positive pathos in his voice as he"
1428,MRS. MILLER,"said aloud, ""It's our divorce. I feel it!"" The note, headed, ""At the"
1429,MRS. MILLER,"Office, 4 in Morning,"" ran like this:"
1430,MRS. MILLER,
1431,MRS. MILLER,"""Dear Mack--I left you slumbering so soundly that, by noon,"
1432,MRS. MILLER,"when you waken, I hope, in your refreshed state, you will"
1433,MRS. MILLER,look more tolerantly on my intentions as partially confided
1434,MRS. MILLER,to you this night. I will not see you here again to say
1435,MRS. MILLER,"good-bye. I wanted to, but was afraid to 'rouse the sleeping"
1436,MRS. MILLER,"lion.' I will not close my eyes to-night--fact is, I haven't"
1437,MRS. MILLER,time. Our serenade at Josie's was a pre-arranged signal by
1438,MRS. MILLER,which she is to be ready and at the station for the 5
1439,MRS. MILLER,morning train. You may remember the lighting of three
1440,MRS. MILLER,consecutive matches at her window before the igniting of her
1441,MRS. MILLER,"lamp. That meant, 'Thrice dearest one, I'll meet thee at the"
1442,MRS. MILLER,"depot at 4:30 sharp.' So, my dear Mack, this is to inform"
1443,MRS. MILLER,"you that, even as you read, Josie and I have eloped. It is"
1444,MRS. MILLER,"all the old man's fault, yet I forgive him. Hope he'll"
1445,MRS. MILLER,"return the favor. Josie predicts he will, inside of a"
1446,MRS. MILLER,"week--or two weeks, anyhow. Good-bye, Mack, old boy; and let"
1447,MRS. MILLER,a fellow down as easy as you can.

2286,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2287,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,The first I seed o' Bills was about two weeks after he got here. The
2288,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Settlement wasn't nothin' but a baby in them days, far I mind 'at old"
2289,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Ezry Sturgiss had jist got his saw and griss-mill a-goin', and Bills"
2290,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"had come along and claimed to know all about millin', and got a job"
2291,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"with him; and millers in them times was wanted worse'n congerss-men,"
2292,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"and I reckon got better wages; far afore Ezry built, ther wasn't a"
2293,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"dust o' meal er flour to be had short o' the White Water, better'n"
2294,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"sixty mild from here, the way we had to fetch it. And they used to"
2295,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,come to Ezry's far ther grindin' as far as that; and one feller I
2296,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"knowed to come from what used to be the old South Fork, over eighty"
2297,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"mild from here, and in the wettest, rainyest weather; and mud! _Law!_"
2298,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2299,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Well, this-here Bills was a-workin' far Ezry at the time--part the"
2300,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"time a-grindin', and part the time a-lookin' after the sawin', and"
2301,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"gittin' out timber and the like. Bills was a queer-lookin' feller,"
2302,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,shore! About as tall a build man as Tom Carter--but of course you
2303,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"don't know nothin' o' Tom Carter. A great big hulk of a feller, Tom"
2304,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,was; and as far back as Fifty-eight used to make his brags that he
2305,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,could cut and put up his seven cord a day.
2306,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2307,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Well, what give Bills this queer look, as I was a-goin' on to say, was"
2308,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,a great big ugly scar a-runnin' from the corner o' one eye clean down
2309,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"his face and neck, and I don't know how far down his breast--awful"
2310,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"lookin'; and he never shaved, and ther wasn't a hair a-growin' in that"
2311,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"scar, and it looked like a--some kind o' pizen snake er somepin' a"
2312,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,crawlin' in the grass and weeds. I never seed sich a' out-an'-out
2313,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"onry-lookin' chap, and I'll never fergit the first time I set eyes on"

2315,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2316,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,Steve and me--Steve was my youngest brother; Steve's be'n in Californy

2319,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,drive; 'peared like Steve was made a-purpose far hosses. The
2320,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"beatin'est hand with hosses 'at ever you _did_ see-an'-I-know! W'y, a"
2321,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"hoss, after he got kind o' used to Steve a-handlin' of him, would do"

2325,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2326,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Well, we'd come over to Ezry's far some grindin' that day; and Steve"
2327,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"wanted to price some lumber far a house, intendin' to marry that"
2328,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Fall--and would a-married, I reckon, ef the girl hadn't a-died jist as"
2329,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"she'd got her weddin' clothes done, and that set hard on Steve far"
2330,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"awhile. Yit he rallied, you know, as a youngster will; but he never"
2331,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"married, someway--never married. Reckon he never found no other woman"
2332,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"he could love well enough, 'less it was--well, no odds.--The Good"

2334,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2335,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"We lived _then_ about eight mild from Ezry's, and it tuck about a day"
2336,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,to make the trip; so you kin kind o' git an idee o' how the roads was
2337,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,in them days.
2338,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2339,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Well, on the way over I noticed Steve was mighty quiet-like, but I"
2340,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"didn't think nothin' of it, tel at last he says, says he, ""Tom, I want"
2341,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"you to kind o' keep an eye out far Ezry's new hand,"" meanin Bills. And"
2342,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,then I kind o' suspicioned somepin' o' nother was up betwixt 'em; and
2343,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"shore enough ther was, as I found out afore the day was over."
2344,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2345,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"I knowed 'at Bills was a mean sort of a man, from what I'd heerd. His"
2346,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,name was all over the neighborhood afore he'd be'n here two weeks.
2347,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2348,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"In the first place, he come in a suspicious sort o' way. Him and his"
2349,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"wife, and a little baby only a few months old, come through in a"
2350,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,kivvered wagon with a fambly a-goin' som'ers in The Illinoy; and they
2351,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"stopped at the mill, far some meal er somepin', and Bills got to"
2352,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"talkin' with Ezry 'bout millin', and one thing o' nother, and said he"
2353,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"was expeerenced some 'bout a mill hisse'f, and told Ezry ef he'd give"
2354,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,him work he'd stop; said his wife and baby wasn't strong enough to
2355,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"stand trav'lin', and ef Ezry'd give him work he was ready to lick into"
2356,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,it then and there; said his woman could pay her board by sewin' and
2357,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"the like, tel they got ahead a little; and then, ef he liked the"
2358,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"neighberhood, he said he'd as leave settle there as anywheres; he was"
2359,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"huntin' a home, he said, and the outlook kind o' struck him, and his"
2360,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"woman railly needed rest, and wasn't strong enough to go much furder."
2361,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,And old Ezry kind o' tuck pity on the feller; and havin' houseroom to
2362,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"spare, and railly in need of a good hand at the mill, he said all"
2363,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,right; and so the feller stopped and the wagon druv ahead and left
2364,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,'em; and they didn't have no things ner nothin'--not even a
2365,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"cyarpet-satchel, ner a stitch o' clothes, on'y what they had on their"
2366,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,backs. And I think it was the third er fourth day after Bills stopped
2367,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"'at he whirped Tomps Burk, the bully o' here them days, tel you would"
2368,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,n't a-knowed him!
2369,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2370,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Well, I'd heerd o' this, and the fact is I'd made up my mind 'at Bills"
2371,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"was a bad stick, and the place was n't none the better far his bein'"
2372,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"here. But, as I was a-goin' on to say,--as Steve and me driv up to the"
2373,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"mill, I ketched sight o' Bills the first thing, a-lookin' out o' where"
2374,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"some boards was knocked off, jist over the worter-wheel; and he knowed"
2375,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Steve--I could see that by his face; and he hollered somepin', too,"
2376,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"but what it was I couldn't jist make out, far the noise o' the wheel;"
2377,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,but he looked to me as ef he'd hollered somepin' mean a-purpose so's
2378,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Steve _wouldn't_ hear it, and _he'd_ have the consolation o' knowin'"
2379,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,'at he'd called Steve some onry name 'thout givin' him a chance to
2380,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"take it up. Steve was allus quiet like, but ef you raised his dander"
2381,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"one't--and you could do that 'thout much trouble, callin' him names er"
2382,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"somepin', particular' anything 'bout his mother. Steve loved his"
2383,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"mother--allus loved his mother, and would fight far her at the drap o'"
2384,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"the hat. And he was her favo-_rite_--allus a-talkin' o' ""her boy,"
2385,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Steven,"" as she used to call him, and so proud of him, and so keerful"
2386,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"of him allus, when he 'd be sick er anything; nuss him like a baby,"
2387,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,she would.
2388,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2389,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"So when Bills hollered, Steve didn't pay no attention; and I said"
2390,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"nothin', o' course, and didn't let on like I noticed him. So we druv"
2391,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,round to the south side and hitched; and Steve 'lowed he'd better
2392,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,feed; so I left him with the hosses and went into the mill.
2393,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2394,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,They was jist a-stoppin' far dinner. Most of 'em brought ther
2395,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"dinners--lived so far away, you know. The two Smith boys lived on what"
2396,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"used to be the old Warrick farm, five er six mild, anyhow, from wher'"
2397,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"the mill stood. Great stout fellers, they was; and little Jake, the"
2398,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"father of 'em, wasn't no man at all--not much bigger'n you, I rickon."
2399,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Le' me see, now:--Ther was Tomps Burk, Wade Elwood, and Joe and Ben"
2400,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Carter, and Wesley Morris, John Coke--wiry little cuss, he was, afore"
2401,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"he got his leg sawed off--and Ezry, and--Well, I don't jist mind all"
2402,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"the boys--'s a long time ago, and I never was much of a hand far"
2403,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"names.--Now, some folks'll hear a name and never fergit it, but I"
2404,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"can't boast of a good ricollection, 'specially o' names; and far the"
2405,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"last thirty year my mem'ry's be'n a-failin' me, ever sence a spell o'"
2406,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"fever 'at I brought on onc't--fever and rheumatiz together. You see, I"
2407,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"went a-sainin' with a passel o' the boys, fool-like, and let my"
2408,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"clothes freeze on me a-comin' home. Wy, my breeches was like"
2409,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"stove-pipes when I pulled 'em off. 'Ll, ef I didn't pay far that"
2410,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,spree! Rheumatiz got a holt o' me and helt me there flat o' my back
2411,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"far eight weeks, and couldn't move hand er foot 'thout a-hollerin'"
2412,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"like a' Injun. And I'd a-be'n there yit, I reckon, ef it had n't"
2413,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"a-be'n far a' old hoss-doctor, name o' Jones; and he gits a lot o' sod"
2414,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"and steeps it in hot whisky and pops it on me, and"
2415,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"I'll-be-switched-to-death ef it didn't cuore me up, far all I laughed"
2416,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,and told him I'd better take the whisky inardly and let him keep the
2417,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,grass far his doctor bill. But that's nuther here ner there:--As I was
2418,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"a-saying 'bout the mill: As I went in, the boys had stopped work and"
2419,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"was a-gittin' down ther dinners, and Bills amongst 'em, and old Ezry"
2420,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"a-chattin' away--great hand, he was, far his joke, and allus a-cuttin'"
2421,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,up and a-gittin' off his odd-come-shorts on the boys. And that day he
2422,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,was in particular good humor. He'd brought some liquor down far the
2423,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"boys, and he'd be'n drinkin' a little hisse'f, enough to feel it. He"
2424,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"didn't drink much--that is to say, he didn't git drunk adzactly; but"
2425,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"he tuck his dram, you understand. You see, they made ther own whisky"
2426,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"in them days, and it was n't nothin' like the bilin' stuff you git"
2427,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"now. Old Ezry had a little still, and allus made his own whisky,"
2428,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"enough far fambly use, and jist as puore as worter, and as harmless."
2429,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,But now-a-days the liquor you git's rank pizen. They say they put
2430,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"tobacker in it, and strychnine, and the Lord knows what; ner I never"
2431,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"knowed why, 'less it was to give it a richer-lookin' flavor, like."
2432,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Well, Ezry he 'd brought up a jug, and the boys had be'n a-takin' it"
2433,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,purty free; I seed that as quick as I went in. And old Ezry called out
2434,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"to me to come and take some, the first thing. Told him I did n't"
2435,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,b'lieve I keered about it; but nothin' would do but I must take a
2436,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,drink with the boys; and I was tired anyhow and I thought a little
2437,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,would n't hurt; so I takes a swig; and as I set the jug down Bills
2438,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"spoke up and says, ""You're a stranger to me, and I'm a stranger to"
2439,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"you, but I reckon we can drink to our better acquaintance,"" er"
2440,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"somepin' to that amount, and poured out another snifter in a gourd"
2441,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"he'd be'n a-drinkin' coffee in, and handed it to me. Well, I could n't"
2442,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"well refuse, of course, so I says, ""Here 's to us,"" and drunk her"
2443,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"down--mighty nigh a half pint, I reckon. Now, I railly did n't want"
2444,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"it, but, as I tell you, I was obleeged to take it, and I downed her at"
2445,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"a swaller and never batted an eye, far, to tell the fact about it, I"
2446,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"liked the taste o' liquor; and I do yit, only I know when I' got"
2447,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,enough. Jist then I didn't want to drink on account o' Steve. Steve
2448,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"couldn't abide liquor in no shape ner form--far medicine ner nothin',"
2449,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,and I 've allus thought it was his mother's doin's.
2450,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2451,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Now, a few months afore this I 'd be'n to Vincennes, and I was jist"
2452,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,a-tellin' Ezry what they was a-astin' far ther liquor there--far I 'd
2453,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"fetched a couple o' gallon home with me 'at I 'd paid six bits far,"
2454,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"and pore liquor at that: And I was a-tellin' about it, and old Ezry"
2455,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"was a-sayin' what an oudacious figger that was, and how he could make"
2456,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"money a-sellin' it far half that price, and was a-goin' on a-braggin'"
2457,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"about his liquor--and it was a good article--far new whisky,--and jist"
2458,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"then Steve comes in, jist as Bills was a-sayin' 'at a man 'at wouldn't"
2459,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"drink that whisky wasn't no man at all. So, of course, when they ast"
2460,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Steve to take some and he told 'em no, 'at he was much obleeged, Bills"
2461,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"was kind o' tuck down, you understand, and had to say somepin'; and"
2462,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"says he, ""I reckon you ain't no better 'n the rest of us, and _we 've_"
2463,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"be'n a-drinkin' of it."" But Steve did n't let on like he noticed Bills"
2464,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"at all, and rech and shuck hands with the other boys and ast how they"
2465,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,was all a-comin' on.
2466,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2467,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"I seed Bills was riled, and more 'n likely wanted trouble; and shore"
2468,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"enough, he went on to say, kind o' snarlin' like, 'at ""he'd knowed o'"
2469,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,men in his day 'at had be'n licked far refusin' to drink when their
2470,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"betters ast 'em;"" and said furder 'at ""a lickin' wasn't none too good"
2471,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"far anybody 'at would refuse liquor like that o' Ezry's, and in his"
2472,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"own house too""--er _buildin'_, ruther. Ezry shuck his head at him, but"
2473,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"I seed 'at Bills was bound far a quarrel, and I winks at Steve, as"
2474,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"much as to say, ""Don't you let him bully you; you'll find your brother"
2475,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"here to see you have fair play!"" _I_ was a-feelin' my oats some about"
2476,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"then, and Steve seed I was, and looked so sorry like, and like his"
2477,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"mother, 'at I jist thought, ""I kin fight far you, and die far you,"
2478,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"'cause you're wuth it!""--And I didn't someway feel like it would"
2479,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,amount to much ef I did die er git killed er somepin' on his account.
2480,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,I seed Steve was mighty white around the mouth and his eyes was a
2481,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"glitterin' like a snake's; but Bills didn't seem to take warnin', but"
2482,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,went on to say 'at he'd knowed boys 'at loved the'r mothers so well
2483,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,they couldn't drink nothin' stronger 'n milk.--And then you'd ort o'
2484,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"seed Steve's coat fly off, jist like it wanted to git out of his way,"
2485,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,and give the boy room accordin' to his stren'th. I seed Bills grab a
2486,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,piece o' scantlin' jist in time to ketch his arm as he struck at
2487,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Steve,--far Steve was a-comin' far him dangerss. But they'd ketched"
2488,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,Steve from behind jist then; and Bills turned far me. I seed him draw
2489,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"back, and I seed Steve a-scufflin' to ketch his arm; but he didn't"
2490,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,reach it quite in time to do me no good. It must a-come awful suddent.
2491,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"The first I ricollect was a roarin' and a buzzin' in my ears, and when"
2492,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"I kind o' come a little better to, and crawled up and peeked over the"
2493,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"saw-log I was a-layin' the other side of, I seed a couple clinched and"
2494,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"a rollin' over and over, and a-makin' the chips and saw-dust fly, now"
2495,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"I tell you! Bills and Steve it was--head and tail, tooth and toenail,"
2496,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,and a-bleedin' like good fellers. I seed a gash o' some kind in
2497,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Bills's head, and Steve was purty well tuckered, and a-pantin' like a"
2498,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"lizard; and I made a rush in, and one o' the Carter boys grabbed me"
2499,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"and told me to jist keep cool; 'at Steve didn't need no he'p, and they"
2500,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,might need me to keep Bills's friends off ef they made a rush. By this
2501,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"time Steve had whirlt Bills, and was a-jist a-gittin' in a fair way to"
2502,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"finish him up in good style, when Wesley Morris run in--I seed him do"
2503,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"it--run in, and afore we could ketch him he struck Steve a deadener in"
2504,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,the butt o' the ear and knocked him as limber as a rag. And then Bills
2505,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"whirlt Steve and got him by the throat, and Ben Carter and me and old"
2506,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Ezry closed in--Carter tackled Morris, and Ezry and me grabs"
2507,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Bills--and as old Ezry grabbed him to pull him off, Bills kind o' give"
2508,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,him a side swipe o' some kind and knocked him--I don't know how far!
2509,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,And jist then Carter and Morris come a-scufflin' back'ards right
2510,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"amongst us, and Carter throwed him right acrost Bills and Steve. Well,"
2511,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"it ain't fair, and I don't like to tell it, but I seed it was the last"
2512,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,chance and I tuck advantage of it:--As Wesley and Ben fell it pulled
2513,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Bills down in a kind o' twist, don't you understand, so's he couldn't"
2514,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"he'p hisse'f, yit still a-clinchin' Steve by the throat, and him black"
2515,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"in the face: Well, as they fell I grabbed up a little hick'ry limb,"
2516,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"not bigger 'n my two thumbs, and I struck Bills a little tap kind o'"
2517,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"over the back of his head like, and blame me ef he didn't keel over"
2518,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"like a stuck pig--and not any too soon, nuther, far he had Steve's"
2519,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"chunk as nigh put out as you ever seed a man's, to come to agin. But"
2520,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,he was up th'reckly and ready to a-went at it ef Bills could a-come to
2521,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,the scratch; but Mister Bills he wasn't in no fix to try it over!
2522,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"After a-waitin' awhile far him to come to, and him not a-comin' to, we"
2523,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"concluded 'at we'd better he'p him, maybe. And we worked with him, and"
2524,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"washed him, and drenched him with whisky, but it 'peared like it"
2525,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"wasn't no use: He jist laid there with his eyes about half shet, and"
2526,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,a-breathin' like a hoss when he's bad sceart; and I'll be dad-limbed
2527,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,ef I don't believe he'd a-died on our hands ef it hadn't a-happened
2528,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,old Doc Zions come a-ridin' past on his way home from the Murdock
2529,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"neighberhood, where they was a-havin' sich a time with the milk-sick."
2530,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"And he examined Bills, and had him laid on a plank and carried down to"
2531,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"the house--'bout a mild, I reckon, from the mill. Looked kind o'"
2532,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"curous to see Steve a-heppin' pack the feller, after his nearly"
2533,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"chokin' him to death. Oh, it was a bloody fight, I tell you! W'y, ther"
2534,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,wasn't a man in the mill 'at didn't have a black eye er somepin'; and
2535,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"old Ezry, where Bills hit him, had his nose broke, and was as bloody"
2536,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,as a butcher. And you'd ort a-seed the women-folks when our p'session
2537,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,come a-bringin' Bills in. I never seed anybody take on like Bills's
2538,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"woman. It was distressin'; it was, indeed.--Went into hysterics, she"
2539,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"did; and we thought far awhile she'd gone plum crazy, far she cried so"
2540,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"pitiful over him, and called him ""Charley! Charley!"" 'stid of his"
2541,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"right name, and went on, clean out of her head, tel she finally jist"
2542,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,fainted clean away.
2543,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2544,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Far three weeks Bills laid betwixt life and death, and that woman set"
2545,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"by him night and day, and tended him as patient as a' angel--and she"
2546,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"was a' angel, too; and he'd a-never lived to bother nobody agin ef it"
2547,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"hadn't a-be'n far Annie, as he called her. Zions said ther was a"
2548,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"'brazure of the--some kind o' p'tubernce, and ef he'd a-be'n struck"
2549,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,jist a quarter of a' inch below--jist a quarter of a' inch--he'd
2550,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,a-be'n a dead man. And I've sence wished--not 'at I want the life of a
2551,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"human bein' to account far, on'y, well, no odds--I've sence wished 'at"
2552,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,I had a-hit him jist a quarter of a' inch below!
2553,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2554,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Well, of course, them days ther wasn't no law o' no account, and"
2555,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"nothin' was ever done about it. So Steve and me got our grindin', and"
2556,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,talked the matter over with Ezry and the boys. Ezry said he was
2557,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"a-goin' to do all he could far Bills, 'cause he was a good hand, and"
2558,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,when he wasn't drinkin' ther wasn't no peaceabler man in the
2559,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"settlement. I kind o' suspicioned what was up, but I said nothin'"
2560,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"then. And Ezry said furder, as we was about drivin' off, that Bills"
2561,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"was a despert feller, and it was best to kind o' humor him a little."
2562,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"""And you must kind o' be on your guard,"" he says, ""and I'll watch him"
2563,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"and ef anything happens 'at I git wind of I'll let you know,"" he says;"
2564,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,and so we put out far home.
2565,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2566,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Mother tuck on awful about it. You see, she thought she'd be'h the"
2567,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"whole blame of it, 'cause the Sunday afore that her and Steve had went"
2568,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"to meetin', and they got there late, and the house was crowded, and"
2569,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Steve had ast Bills to give up his seat to Mother, and he wouldn't do"
2570,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"it, and said somepin' 'at disturbed the prayin', and the preacher"
2571,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,prayed 'at the feller 'at was a-makin' the disturbance might be
2572,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"forgive; and that riled Bills so he got up and left, and hung around"
2573,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"till it broke up, so's he could git a chance at Steve to pick a fight."
2574,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"And he did try it, and dared Steve and double-dared him far a fight,"
2575,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,but Mother begged so hard 'at she kep' him out of it. Steve said 'at
2576,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"he'd a-told me all about it on the way to Ezry's, on'y he'd promised"
2577,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Mother, you know, not to say nothin' to me."
2578,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2579,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,*       *       *       *       *
2580,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2581,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Ezry was over at our house about six weeks after the fight,"
2582,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,appearantly as happy as you please. We ast him how him and Bills was
2583,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"a-makin' it, and he said firstrate; said 'at Bills was jist a-doin'"
2584,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,splendid; said he'd got moved in his new house 'at he'd fixed up far
2585,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"him, and ever'thing was a-goin' on as smooth as could be; and Bills"
2586,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"and the boys was on better terms 'n ever; and says he, ""As far as you"
2587,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"and Steve 's concerned, Bills don't 'pear to bear you no ill feelin's,"
2588,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"and says as far as he 's concerned the thing 's settled."" ""Well,"" says"
2589,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"I, ""Ezry, I hope so; but I can't he'p but think ther 's somepin' at"
2590,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"the bottom of all this;"" and says I, ""I do n't think it's in Bills to"
2591,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"ever amount to anything good;"" and says I, ""It's my opinion ther 's a"
2592,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"dog in the well, and now you mark it!"""
2593,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2594,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Well, he said he _wasn't_ jist easy, but maybe he 'd come out all"
2595,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,right; said he couldn't turn the feller off--he hadn't the heart to do
2596,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"that, with that-air pore, dilicate woman o' his, and the baby. And"
2597,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,then he went on to tell what a smart sort o' woman Bills's wife
2598,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"was,--one of the nicest little women he 'd ever laid eyes on, said she"
2599,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"was; said she was the kindest thing, and the sweetest-tempered, and"
2600,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"all--and the handiest woman 'bout the house, and 'bout sewin', and"
2601,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"cookin', and the like, and all kinds o' housework; and so good to the"
2602,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"childern, and all; and how they all got along so well; and how proud"
2603,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"she was of her baby, and allus a-goin' on about it and a-cryin' over"
2604,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"it and a-carryin' on, and wouldn't leave it out of her sight a minute."
2605,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"And Ezry said 'at she could write so purty, and made sich purty"
2606,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,pictures far the childern; and how they all liked her better'n ther
2607,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"own mother. And, sence she'd moved, he said it seemed so lonesome like"
2608,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,'thout _her_ about the house--like they'd lost one o' ther own fambly;
2609,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"said they didn't git to see her much now, on'y sometimes, when her man"
2610,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"would be at work, she'd run over far awhile, and kiss all the childern"
2611,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"and women-folks about the place,--the greatest hand far the childern,"
2612,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"she was; tell 'em all sorts o'little stories, you know, and sing far"
2613,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"'em; said 'at she could sing so sweet-like,'at time and time agin"
2614,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"she'd break clean down in some song o'nuther, and her voice would"
2615,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,trimble so mournful-like 'at you'd find yourse'f a-cryin' afore you
2616,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,knowed it. And she used to coax Ezry's woman to let her take the
2617,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"childern home with her; and they used to allus want to go, 'tel Bills"
2618,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"come onc't while they was there, and they said he got to jawin' her"
2619,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"far a-makin' some to-do over the baby, and swore at her and tuck it"
2620,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"away from her and whipped it far cryin', and she cried and told him to"
2621,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"whip her and not little Annie, and he said that was jist what he was"
2622,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,a-doin'. And the childern was allus afear'd to go there any more after
2623,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,that--'fear'd he'd come home and whip little Annie agin. Ezry said he
2624,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,jist done that to skeer 'em away--'cause he didn't want a passel o'
2625,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,childern a-whoopin' and a-howlin' and a-trackin' 'round the house all
2626,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,the time.
2627,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2628,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"But, shore enough, Bills, after the fight, 'peared like he 'd settled"
2629,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"down, and went 'bout his business so stiddy-like, and worked so well,"
2630,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"the neighbors begin to think he was all right after all, and railly"
2631,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"_some_ got to _likin'_ him. But far me, well, I was a leetle slow to"
2632,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"argy 'at the feller wasn't ""a-possumin'."" But the next time I went"
2633,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"over to the mill--and Steve went with me--old Ezry come and met us,"
2634,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"and said 'at Bills didn't have no hard feelin's ef _we_ didn't, and"
2635,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,'at he wanted us to fergive him; said 'at Bills wanted him to tell us
2636,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"'at he was sorry the way he'd acted, and wanted us to fergive him."
2637,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Well, I looked at Ezry, and we both looked at him, jist perfectly tuck"
2638,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"back--the idee o' Bills a-wantin' anybody to fergive him! And says I,"
2639,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"""Ezry, what in the name o' common sense do you mean?"" And says he, ""I"
2640,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,mean jist what I say; Bills jined meetin' last night and had 'em all
2641,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"a-prayin' far him; and we all had _a glorious time_,"" says old Ezry;"
2642,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"""and his woman was there and jined, too, and prayed and shouted and"
2643,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,tuck on to beat all; and Bills got up and spoke and give in his
2644,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"experience, and said he'd be'n a bad man, but, glory to God, them"
2645,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,times was past and gone; said 'at he wanted all of 'em to pray far
2646,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"him, and he wanted to prove faithful, and wanted all his inemies to"
2647,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,fergive him; and prayed 'at you and Steve and your folks would fergive
2648,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"him, and ever'body 'at he ever wronged anyway."" And old Ezry was"
2649,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"a-goin' on, and his eyes a-sparklin', and a-rubbin' his hands, he was"
2650,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"so excited and tickled over it, 'at Steve and me we jist stood there"
2651,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"a-gawkin' like, tel Bills hisse'f come up and rech out one hand to"
2652,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Steve and one to me; and Steve shuck with him kind o' oneasy like, and"
2653,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"I--well, sir, I never felt cur'oser in my born days than I did that"
2654,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"minute. The cold chills crep' over me, and I shuck as ef I had the"
2655,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"agur, and I folded my hands behind me and I looked that feller square"
2656,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"in the eye, and I tried to speak three or four times afore I could"
2657,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"make it, and when I did, my voice wasn't natchurl--sounded like a"
2658,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"feller a-whisperin' through a tin horn er somepin'.--and I says, says"
2659,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"I, ""You're a liar,"" slow and delibert. That was all. His eyes blazed a"
2660,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"minute, and drapped; and he turned, 'thout a word, and walked off. And"
2661,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Ezry says, ""He's in airnest; I know he's in airnest, er he'd a-never"
2662,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"a-tuck that!"" And so he went on, tel finally Steve jined in, and"
2663,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,betwixt 'em they p'suaded me 'at I was in the wrong and the best thing
2664,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"to do was to make it all up, which I finally did. And Bills said 'at"
2665,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"he'd a-never a-felt jist right 'thout _my_ friendship, far he'd"
2666,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"wronged me, he said, and he'd wronged Steve and Mother, too, and he"
2667,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"wanted a chance, he said, o' makin' things straight agin."
2668,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2669,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Well, a-goin' home, I don't think Steve and me talked o' nothin' else"
2670,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"but Bills--how airnest the feller acted 'bout it, and how, ef he"
2671,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"_wasn't_ in airnest he'd a-never a-swallered that 'lie,' you see."
2672,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"That's what walked my log, far he could a-jist as easy a-knocked me"
2673,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,higher 'n Kilgore's kite as he could to walk away 'thout a-doin' of
2674,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,it.
2675,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2676,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Mother was awful tickled when she heerd about it, far she'd had an"
2677,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"idee 'at we'd have trouble afore we got back, and a-gitten home safe,"
2678,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"and a-bringin' the news 'bout Bills a-jinin' church and all, tickled"
2679,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"her so 'at she mighty nigh shouted far joy. You see, Mother was a' old"
2680,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,church-member all her life; and I don't think she ever missed a
2681,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,sermont er a prayer-meetin' 'at she could possibly git to--rain er
2682,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"shine, wet er dry. When ther was a meetin' of any kind a-goin' on, go"
2683,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"she would, and nothin' short o' sickness in the fambly, er knowin'"
2684,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,nothin' of it would stop _her_! And clean up to her dyin' day she was
2685,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,a God-fearin' and consistent Christian ef ther ever was one. I mind
2686,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,now when she was tuck with her last spell and laid bedfast far
2687,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"eighteen months, she used to tell the preacher, when he 'd come to see"
2688,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"her and pray and go on, 'at she could die happy ef she could on'y be"
2689,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,with 'em all agin in their love-feasts and revivals. She was purty low
2690,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"then, and had be'n a-failin' fast far a day er two; and that day"
2691,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"they'd be'n a-holdin' service at the house. It was her request, you"
2692,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"know, and the neighbers had congergated and was a-prayin' and"
2693,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"a-singin' her favorite hymns--one in p'tickler, ""God moves in a"
2694,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"mysterous way his wunders to p'form,"" and 'bout his ""Walkin' on the"
2695,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"sea and a-ridin' of the storm.""--Well, anyway, they'd be'n a-singin'"
2696,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"that hymn far her--she used to sing that 'n so much, I ricollect as"
2697,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,far back as I kin remember; and I mind how it used to make me feel so
2698,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"lonesome-like and solemn, don't you know,--when I'd be a-knockin'"
2699,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"round the place along of evenin's, and she'd be a-milkin', and I'd"
2700,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"hear her, at my feedin', way off by myse'f, and it allus somehow made"
2701,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,me feel like a feller'd ort o' try and live as nigh right as the law
2702,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"allows, and that's about my doctern yit. Well, as I was a-goin' on to"
2703,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"say, they'd jist finished that old hymn, and Granny Lowry was jist"
2704,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"a-goin to lead in prayer, when I noticed mother kind o' tried to turn"
2705,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"herse'f in bed, and smiled so weak and faint-like, and looked at me,"
2706,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,with her lips a-kind o' movin'; and I thought maybe she wanted another
2707,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"dos't of her syrup 'at Ezry's woman had fixed up far her, and I kind"
2708,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"o' stooped down over her and ast her if she wanted anything. ""Yes,"""
2709,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"she says, and nodded, and her voice sounded so low and solemn and so"
2710,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,far away-like 'at I knowed she'd never take no more medicine on this
2711,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"airth. And I tried to ast her what it was she wanted, but I couldn't"
2712,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"say nothin'; my throat hurt me, and I felt the warm tears a-boolgin'"
2713,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"up, and her kind old face a-glimmerin' a-way so pale-like afore my"
2714,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"eyes, and still a-smilin' up so lovin' and forgivin' and so good 'at"
2715,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,it made me think so far back in the past I seemed to be a little boy
2716,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"agin; and seemed like her thin gray hair was brown, and a-shinin' in"
2717,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,the sun as it used to do when she helt me on her shoulder in the open
2718,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"door, when Father was a-livin' and we used to go to meet him at the"
2719,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"bars; seemed like her face was young agin, and a-smilin' like it allus"
2720,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"used to be, and her eyes as full o' hope and happiness as afore they"
2721,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,ever looked on grief er ever shed a tear. And I thought of all the
2722,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"trouble they had saw on my account, and of all the lovin' words her"
2723,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"lips had said, and of all the thousand things her pore old hands had"
2724,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,done far me 'at I never even thanked her far; and how I loved her
2725,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"better 'n all the world besides, and would be so lonesome ef she went"
2726,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,away--Lord! I can't tell you what I didn't think and feel and see. And
2727,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"I knelt down by her, and she whispered then far Steven, and he come,"
2728,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,and we kissed her--and she died--a smilin' like a child--jist like a
2729,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,child.
2730,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2731,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,Well--well! 'Pears like I'm allus a-runnin' into somepin' else. I
2732,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,wisht I could tell a story 'thout driftin' off in matters 'at hain't
2733,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,no livin' thing to do with what I started out with. I try to keep from
2734,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"thinkin' of afflictions and the like, 'cause sich is bound to come to"
2735,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"the best of us; but a feller's ricollection will bring 'em up, and I"
2736,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"reckon it'd ort 'o be er it wouldn't be; and I've thought, sometimes,"
2737,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"it was done may be to kind o' admonish a feller, as the Good Book"
2738,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"says, of how good a world 'd be 'thout no sorrow in it."
2739,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2740,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Where was I? Oh, yes, I ricollect;--about Bills a-jinin' church. Well,"
2741,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"sir, ther' wasn't a better-actin' feller and more religious-like in"
2742,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"all the neighberhood. Spoke in meetin's, he did, and tuck a' active"
2743,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"part in all religious doin's, and, in fact, was jist as square a man,"
2744,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"appearantly, as the preacher hisse'f. And about six er eight weeks"
2745,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"after he'd jined, they got up another revival, and things run high."
2746,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Ther' was a big excitement, and ever'body was a'tendin' from far and"
2747,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"near. Bills and Ezry got the mill-hands to go, and didn't talk o'"
2748,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,nothin' but religion. People thought awhile 'at old Ezry 'd turn
2749,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"preacher, he got so interested 'bout church matters. He was easy"
2750,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,excited 'bout anything; and when he went into a thing it was in dead
2751,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"earnest, shore!--""jist flew off the handle,"" as I heerd a comical"
2752,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,feller git off onct. And him and Bills was up and at it ever'
2753,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,night--prayin' and shoutin' at the top o' the'r voice. Them railly did
2754,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"seem like good times--when ever'body jined together, and prayed and"
2755,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"shouted ho-sanner, and danced around together, and hugged each other"
2756,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,like they was so full o' glory they jist couldn't he'p
2757,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,theirse'v's--that's the reason I jined; it looked so kind o'
2758,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"whole-souled-like and good, you understand. But la! I didn't hold out"
2759,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"on'y far a little while, and no wunder!"
2760,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2761,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Well, about them times Bills was tuck down with the agur; first got to"
2762,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"chillin' ever'-other-day, then ever' day, and harder and harder, tel"
2763,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,sometimes he 'd be obleeged to stay away from meetin' on account of
2764,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"it. And one't I was at meetin' when he told about it, and how when he"
2765,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"couldn't be with 'em he allus prayed at home, and he said 'at he"
2766,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"believed his prayers was answered, far onc't he'd prayed far a new"
2767,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"outpourin' of the Holy Sperit, and that very night ther' was three new"
2768,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,jiners. And another time he said 'at he 'd prayed 'at Wesley Morris
2769,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"would jine, and lo and behold you! he _did_ jine, and the very night"
2770,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,'at he prayed he would.
2771,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2772,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Well, the night I'm a-speakin' of he'd had a chill the day afore and"
2773,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"couldn't go that night, and was in bed when Ezry druv past far him;"
2774,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"said he'd like to go, but had a high fever and couldn't. And then"
2775,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,Ezry's woman ast him ef he was too sick to spare Annie; and he said
2776,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"no, they could take her and the baby: and told her to fix his medicine"
2777,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"so's he could reach it 'thout gittin' out o' bed, and he'd git along"
2778,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,'thout her. And so she tuck the baby and went along with Ezry and his
2779,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,folks.
2780,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2781,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,I was at meetin' that night and ricollect 'em comin' in. Annie got a
2782,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,seat jist behind me--Steve give her his'n and stood up; and I
2783,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,ricollect a-astin' her how Bills was a-gittin' along with the agur;
2784,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"and little Annie, the baby, kep' a-pullin' my hair and a-crowin' tel"
2785,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,finally she went to sleep; and Steve ast her mother to let _him_ hold
2786,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"her--cutest little thing you ever laid eyes on, and the very pictur'"
2787,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,_of_ her mother.
2788,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2789,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Old Daddy Barker preached that night, and a mighty good sermont. His"
2790,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"text, ef I ricollect right, was ""workin' out your own salvation;"" and"
2791,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,when I listen to preachers nowadays in ther big churches and ther fine
2792,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"pulpits, I allus think o' Daddy Barker, and kind o' some way wisht the"
2793,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"old times could come agin, with the old log meetin'-house with its"
2794,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"puncheon floor and the chinkin' in the walls, and old Daddy Barker in"
2795,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,the pulpit. He'd make you feel 'at the Lord could make hissef at home
2796,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"there, and find jist as abundant comfort in the old log house as he"
2797,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,could in any of your fine-furnished churches 'at you can't set down in
2798,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"'thout payin' far the privilege, like it was a theater."
2799,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2800,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Ezry had his two little girls jine that night, and I ricollect the"
2801,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,preacher made sich a purty prayer about the Savior a-cotin' from the
2802,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Bible 'bout ""Suffer little childern to come unto me"" and all; and"
2803,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"talked so purty about the jedgment day, and mothers a-meetin' the'r"
2804,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,little ones there and all; and went on tel ther wasn't a dry eye in
2805,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"the house--and jist as he was a-windin' up, Abe Riggers stuck his head"
2806,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"in at the door and hollered ""fire"" loud as he could yell. We all"
2807,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"rushed out, a-thinkin' it was the meetin'-house; but he hollered it"
2808,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"was the mill; and shore enough, away off to the southards we could see"
2809,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"the light acrost the woods, and see the blaze a-lickin' up above the"
2810,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,trees. I seed old Ezry as he come a-scufflin' through the crowd; and
2811,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"we put out together far it. Well, it was two mild to the mill, but by"
2812,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"the time we'd half way got there, we could tell it wasn't the mill"
2813,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"a-burnin', 'at the fire was furder to the left, and that was Ezry's"
2814,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,house; and by the time we got there it wasn't much use. We pitched
2815,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"into the household goods, and got out the beddin', and the furnitur'"
2816,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"and cheers and the like o' that; saved the clock and a bedstid, and"
2817,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,got the bureau purt' nigh out when they hollered to us 'at the roof
2818,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"was a cavin' in, and we had to leave it; well, we'd tuck the drawers"
2819,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"out, all but the big one, and that was locked; and it and all in it"
2820,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"went with the buildin', and that was a big loss: All the money 'at"
2821,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Ezry was a-layin' by was in that-air drawer, and a lot o' keepsakes"
2822,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,and trinkets 'at Ezry's woman said she wouldn't a-parted with far the
2823,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,world and all.
2824,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2825,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,I never seed a troubleder fambly than they was. It jist 'peared like
2826,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"old Ezry give clean down, and the women and childern a-cryin' and"
2827,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,a-takin' on. It looked jist awful--shore's you're born!--Losin'
2828,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"ever'thing they'd worked so hard far--and there it was, purt' nigh"
2829,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"midnight, and a fambly, jist a little while ago all so happy, and now"
2830,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,with no home to go to ner nothin'!
2831,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2832,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,It was arranged far Ezry's to move in with Bills--that was about the
2833,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,on'y chance--on'y one room and a loft; but Bills said they could
2834,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"manage _some_ way, far a while anyhow."
2835,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2836,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Bills said he seed the fire when it first started, and could a-put it"
2837,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,out ef he'd on'y be'n strong enough to git there; said he started
2838,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"twic't to go, but was too weak and had to go back to bed agin; said it"
2839,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,was a-blazin' in the kitchen roof when he first seed it. So the
2840,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,gineral conclusion 'at we all come to was--it must a-ketched from the
2841,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,flue.
2842,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2843,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,It was too late in the Fall then to think o' buildin' even the onryest
2844,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"kind o' shanty, and so Ezry moved in with Bills. And Bills used to say"

2846,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"nuthin' to put in it, nuther. You see, all the household goods 'at"
2847,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Bills had in the world he'd got of Ezry, and he 'lowed he'd be a"
2848,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,triflin' whelp ef he didn't do all in his power to make Ezry perfeckly
2849,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,at home 's long as he wanted to stay there. And together they managed
2850,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"to make room far 'em all, by a-buildin' a kind o' shed-like to the"
2851,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"main house, intendin' to build when Spring come. And ever'thing went"
2852,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"along first-rate, I guess; never heerd no complaints--that is,"
2853,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,p'ticular.
2854,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2855,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Ezry was kind o' down far a long time, though; didn't like to talk"
2856,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"about his trouble much, and didn't 'tend meetin' much, like he used"
2857,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"to; said it made him think 'bout his house burnin', and he didn't feel"
2858,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,safe to lose sight o' the mill. And the meetin's kind o' broke up
2859,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"altogether that winter. Almost broke up religious doin's, it did. 'S"
2860,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,long as I've lived here I never seed jist sich a slack in religion as
2861,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"ther' was that winter; and 'fore then, I kin mind the time when ther'"
2862,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,wasn't a night the whole endurin' winter when they didn't have
2863,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"preachin' er prayer-meetin' o' some kind a-goin' on. W'y, I ricollect"
2864,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"one night in p'ticular--_the coldest_ night, _whooh!_ And somebody had"
2865,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"stold the meetin'-house door, and they was obleeged to preach 'thout"
2866,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,it. And the wind blowed in so they had to hold the'r hats afore the
2867,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"candles, and then one't-in-a-while they'd git sluffed out. And the"
2868,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,snow drifted in so it was jist like settin' out doors; and they had to
2869,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,stand up when they prayed--yessir! stood up to pray. I noticed that
2870,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"night they was a' oncommon lot o' jiners, and I believe to this day"
2871,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,'at most of 'em jined jist to git up wher' the stove was. Lots o'
2872,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,folks had the'r feet froze right in meetin'; and Steve come home with
2873,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,his ears froze like they was whittled out o' bone; and he said 'at
2874,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Mary Madaline Wells's feet was froze, and she had two pair o' socks on"
2875,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"over her shoes. Oh, it was cold, now I tell you!"
2876,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2877,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,They run the mill part o' that winter--part they couldn't. And they
2878,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"didn't work to say stiddy tel along in Aprile, and then ther' was snow"
2879,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"on the ground yit--in the shadders--and the ground froze, so you"
2880,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,couldn't hardly dig a grave. But at last they got to kind o' jiggin'
2881,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"along agin. Plenty to do ther' was; and old Ezry was mighty tickled,"
2882,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,too; 'peared to recruit right up like. Ezry was allus best tickled
2883,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"when things was a-stirrin', and then he was a-gittin' ready far"
2884,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"buildin', you know, wanted a house of his own, he said--and of course"
2885,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"it wasn't adzackly like home, all cluttered up as they was there at"
2886,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Bills's. They got along mighty well, though, together; and the"
2887,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,women-folks and childern got along the best in the world. Ezry's woman
2888,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,used to say she never laid eyes on jist sich another woman as Annie
2889,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,was. Said it was jist as good as a winter's schoolin' far the
2890,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"childern; said her two little girls had learnt to read, and didn't"
2891,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"know the'r a-b abs afore Annie learnt 'em; well, the oldest one, Mary"
2892,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Patience, she did know her letters, I guess--fourteen year old, she"
2893,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"was; but Mandy, the youngest, had never seed inside a book afore that"
2894,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,winter; and the way she learnt was jist su'prisin'. She was puny-like
2895,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"and frail-lookin' allus, but ever'body 'lowed she was a heap smarter"
2896,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"'n Mary Patience, and she was; and in my opinion she railly had more"
2897,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"sense 'n all the rest o' the childern put together, 'bout books and"
2898,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"cipherin' and arethmetic, and the like; and John Wesley, the oldest of"
2899,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"'em, he got to teachin' at last, when he growed up,--but, la! he"
2900,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,couldn't write his own name so 's you could read it. I allus thought
2901,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,ther was a good 'eal of old Ezry in John Wesley. Liked to romance
2902,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"'round with the youngsters 'most too well.--Spiled him far teachin', I"
2903,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"allus thought; far instance, ef a scholard said somepin' funny in"
2904,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"school, John-Wes he'd jist have to have his laugh out with the rest,"
2905,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"and it was jist fun far the boys, you know, to go to school to him."
2906,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Allus in far spellin'-matches and the like, and learnin' songs and"
2907,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"sich. I ricollect he give a' exhibition onc't, one winter, and I'll"
2908,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"never fergit it, I reckon."
2909,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2910,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"The school-house would on'y hold 'bout forty, comfortable, and that"
2911,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,night ther' was up'ards of a hunderd er more--jist crammed and jammed!
2912,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,And the benches was piled back so's to make room far the flatform
2913,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,they'd built to make the'r speeches and dialogues on; and fellers
2914,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"a-settin' up on them back seats, the'r heads was clean aginst the"
2915,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"j'ist. It was a low ceilin', anyhow, and o' course them 'at tuck a"
2916,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"part in the doin's was way up, too. Janey Thompson had to give up her"
2917,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"part in a dialogue, 'cause she looked so tall she was afeard the"
2918,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,congergation would laugh at her; and they couldn't git her to come out
2919,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,and sing in the openin' song 'thout lettin' her set down first and git
2920,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"ready 'fore they pulled the curtain. You see, they had sheets sewed"
2921,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"together, and fixed on a string some way, to slide back'ards and"
2922,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"for'ards, don't you know. But they was a big bother to 'em--couldn't"
2923,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,git 'em to work like. Ever' time they'd git 'em slid 'bout half way
2924,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"acrost, somepin' would ketch, and they'd have to stop and fool with"
2925,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,'em awhile 'fore they could git 'em the balance o' the way acrost.
2926,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Well, finally, t'ords the last, they jist kep' 'em drawed back all the"
2927,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"time. It was a pore affair, and spiled purt nigh ever' piece; but the"
2928,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"scholards all wanted it fixed thataway, the teacher said, in a few"
2929,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"appropert remarks he made when the thing was over. Well, I was a"
2930,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"settin' in the back part o' the house on them high benches, and my"
2931,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"head was jist even with them on the flatform, and the lights was pore,"
2932,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,wher' the string was stretched far the curtain to slide on it looked
2933,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,like the p'formers was strung on it. And when Lige Boyer's boy was
2934,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"a-speakin'--kind o' mumbled it, you know, and you couldn't half"
2935,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,hear--it looked far the world like he was a-chawin' on that-air
2936,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,string; and some devilish feller 'lowed ef he'd chaw it clean in two
2937,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,it'd be a good thing far the balance. After that they all sung a
2938,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"sleigh-ridin' song, and it was right purty, the way they got it off."
2939,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Had a passel o' sleigh-bells they'd ring ever' onc't-in-a-while, and"
2940,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,it sounded purty--shore!
2941,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2942,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Then Hunicut's girl, Marindy, read a letter 'bout winter, and what fun"
2943,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"the youngsters allus had in winter-time, a-sleighin' and the like, and"
2944,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"spellin'-matches, and huskin'-bees, and all. Purty good, it was, and"
2945,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"made a feller think o' old times. Well, that was about the best thing"
2946,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,ther' was done that night; but ever'body said the teacher wrote it far
2947,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"her; and I wouldn't be su'prised much, far they was married not long"
2948,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,afterwards. I expect he wrote it far her.--Wouldn't put it past Wes!
2949,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2950,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"They had a dialogue, too, 'at was purty good. Little Bob Arnold was"
2951,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"all fixed up--had on his pap's old bell-crowned hat, the one he was"
2952,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"married in. Well, I jist thought die I would when I seed that old hat"
2953,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"and called to mind the night his pap was married, and we all got him a"
2954,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,little how-come-you-so on some left-handed cider 'at had be'n a-layin'
2955,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,in a whisky-bar'l tel it was strong enough to bear up a' egg. I kin
2956,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"ricollect now jist how he looked in that hat, when it was all new, you"
2957,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"know, and a-settin on the back of his head, and his hair in his eyes;"
2958,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,and sich hair!--as red as git-out--and his little black eyes a-shinin'
2959,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"like beads. Well sir, you'd a-died to a-seed him a-dancin'. We danced"
2960,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"all night that night, and would a-be'n a-dancin' yit, I reckon, ef the"
2961,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,fiddler hadn't a-give out. Wash Lowry was a-fiddlin' far us; and along
2962,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,to'rds three or four in the mornin' Wash was purty well fagged out.
2963,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"You see, Wash could never play far a dance er nothin' 'thout"
2964,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"a-drinkin' more er less, and when he got to a certain pitch you"
2965,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"couldn't git nothin' out o' him but ""Barbary Allan;"" so at last he"
2966,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"struck up on that, and jist kep' it up and _kep_' it up, and nobody"
2967,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,couldn't git nothin' else out of him!
2968,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
2969,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Now, anybody 'at ever danced knows 'at ""Barbary Allan"" hain't no tune"
2970,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"to dance by, no way you can fix it; and, o' course, the boys seed at"
2971,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,onc't the'r fun was gone ef they could n't git him on another
2972,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"tune.--And they 'd coax and beg and plead with him, and maybe git him"
2973,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"started on ""The Wind Blows over the Barley,"" and 'bout the time they'd"
2974,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"git to knockin' it down agin purty lively, he'd go to sawin' away on"
2975,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"""Barbary Allan""--and I'll-be-switched-to-death ef that feller didn't"
2976,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"set there and play hisse'f sound asleep on ""Barbary Allan,"" and we had"
2977,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"to wake him up afore he'd quit! Now, that's jes' a plum' facts. And"
2978,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"ther' wasn't a better fiddler nowheres than Wash Lowry, when he was at"
2979,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"hisse'f. I've heerd a good many fiddlers in my day, and I never heerd"
2980,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,one yit 'at could play my style o' fiddlin' ekal to Wash Lowry. You
2981,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"see, Wash didn't play none o' this-here newfangled music--nothin' but"
2982,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"the old tunes, you understand, ""The ForkÚd Deer,"" and ""Old Fat Gal,"""
2983,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"and ""Gray Eagle,"" and the like. Now, them's music! Used to like to"
2984,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"hear Wash play ""Gray Eagle."" He could come as nigh a-makin' that old"
2985,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,tune talk as ever you heerd! Used to think a heap o' his fiddle--and
2986,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"he had a good one, shore. I've heard him say, time and time agin, 'at"
2987,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"a five-dollar gold-piece wouldn't buy it, and I knowed him my-se'f to"
2988,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"refuse a calf far it onc't--yessir, a yearland calf--and the feller"
2989,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"offered him a double-bar'l'd pistol to boot, and blame ef he'd take"
2990,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,it; said he'd ruther part with anything else he owned than his
2991,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"fiddle.--But here I am, clean out o' the furry agin. Oh, yes; I was"
2992,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"a-tellin' about little Bob, with that old hat; and he had on a"
2993,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"swaller-tail coat and a lot o' fixin's, a-actin' like he was 'squire;"
2994,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"and he had him a great long beard made out o' corn-silks, and you"
2995,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"wouldn't a-knowed him ef it wasn't far his voice. Well, he was"
2996,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"a-p'tendin' he was a 'squire a-tryin' some kind o' law-suit, you see;"
2997,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"and John Wesley he was the defendunt, and Joney Wiles, I believe it"
2998,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"was, played like he was the plaintive. And they'd had a fallin' out"
2999,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"'bout some land, and was a-lawin' far p'session, you understand. Well,"
3000,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,Bob he made out it was a mighty bad case when John-Wes comes to
3001,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"consult him about it, and tells _him_ ef a little p'int o' law was"
3002,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,left out he thought he could git the land far him. And then John-Wes
3003,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"bribes him, you understand, to leave out the p'int o' law, and the"
3004,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"'squire says he'll do all he kin, and so John-Wes goes out a feelin'"
3005,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,purty good. Then _Wiles_ comes in to consult the 'squire don't you
3006,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,see. And the 'squire tells _him_ the same tale he told _John Wesley_.
3007,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"So _Wiles_ bribes him to leave out the p'int o' law in _his_ favor,"
3008,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,don't you know. So when the case is tried he decides in favor o'
3009,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"John-Wes, a-tellin' Wiles some cock-and-bull story 'bout havin' to"
3010,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,manage it thataway so 's to git the case mixed so's he could git it
3011,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,far him shore; and posts him to sue far change of venue er
3012,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"somepin',--anyway, Wiles gits a new trial, and then the 'squire"
3013,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"decides in _his_ favor, and tells John-Wes another trial will fix it"
3014,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"in _his_ favor, and so on.--And so it goes on tel, anyway, he gits"
3015,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"holt o' the land hisse'f and all ther money besides, and leaves them"
3016,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"to hold the bag! Wellsir, it was purty well got up; and they said it"
3017,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"was John-Wes's doin's, and I 'low it was--he was a good hand at"
3018,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"anything o' that sort, and knowed how to make fun.--But I've be'n a"
3019,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"tellin' you purty much ever'thing but what I started out with, and"
3020,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"I'll try and hurry through, 'cause I know you're tired."
3021,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
3022,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"'Long 'bout the beginin' o' summer, things had got back to purty much"
3023,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"the old way. The boys round was a-gittin' devilish, and o' nights"
3024,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"'specially ther' was a sight o' meanness a-goin' on. The mill-hands,"
3025,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"most of'em, was mixed up in it--Coke and Morris, and them 'at had"
3026,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"jined meetin' 'long in the winter, had all backslid, and was"
3027,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,a-drinkin' and carousin' 'round worse 'n ever.
3028,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
3029,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"People perdicted 'at Bills would backslide, but he helt on faithful,"
3030,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,to all appearance; said he liked to see a feller when he made up his
3031,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"mind to do right, he liked to see him do it, and not go back on his"
3032,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,word; and even went so far as to tell Ezry ef they didn't put a stop
3033,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,to it he'd quit the neighberhood and go some'rs else. And Bills was
3034,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Ezry's head man then, and he couldn't a-got along 'thout him; and I"
3035,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,b'lieve ef Bills had a-said the word old Ezry would a-turned off ever'
3036,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,hand he had. He got so he jist left ever'thing to Bills. Ben Carter
3037,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"was turned off far somepin', and nobody ever knowed what. Bills and"
3038,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,him had never got along jist right sence the fight.
3039,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
3040,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Ben was with this set I was a-tellin' you 'bout, and they'd got him to"
3041,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"drinkin' and in trouble, o' course. I'd knowed Ben well enough to know"
3042,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"he wouldn't do nothin' onry ef he wasn't agged on, and ef he ever was"
3043,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,mixed up in anything o' the kind Wes Morris and John Coke was at the
3044,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"bottom of it, and I take notice they wasn't turned off when Ben was."
3045,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
3046,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"One night the crowd was out, and Ben amongst 'em, o' course.--Sence"
3047,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"he'd be'n turned off he'd be'n a-drinkin',--and I never blamed him"
3048,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"much; he was so good-hearted like and easy led off, and I allus"
3049,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,b'lieved it wasn't his own doin's.
3050,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
3051,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Well, this night they cut up awful, and ef ther was one fight ther was"
3052,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"a dozend; and when all the devilment was done they _could_ do, they"
3053,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"started on a stealin' expedition, and stold a lot o' chickens and tuck"
3054,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"'em to the mill to roast'em; and, to make a long story short, that"
3055,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,night the mill burnt clean to the ground. And the whole pack of 'em
3056,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,cologued together aginst Carter to saddle it onto him; claimed 'at
3057,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,they left Ben there at the mill 'bout twelve o'clock--which was a
3058,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"fact, far he was dead drunk and couldn't git away. Steve stumbled over"
3059,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,him while the mill was a-burnin' and drug him out afore he knowed what
3060,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"was a-goin' on, and it was all plain enough to Steve 'at Ben didn't"
3061,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,have no hand in the firm' of it. But I'll tell you he sobered up
3062,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"mighty suddent when he seed what was a-goin' on, and heerd the"

3064,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,seemed to be the ginerl idee 'at the buildin' was fired a-purpose. And
3065,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"says Ben to Steve, says he, ""I expect I'll have to say good-bye to"
3066,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"you, far they've got me in a ticklish place! I kin see through it all"

3068,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"""Where's Ben Carter?"" and started to'rds where me and Ben and Steve"

3183,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"climb in he'd git a whack o' the oar, tel finally they got to pilin'"
3184,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"in a little too fast far him to manage, and he hollered then 'at we'd"

3189,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Wellsir, we watched far him, and some o' the boys swum on down stream,"

3194,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,wasn't no trace o' Steve er the baby to be found. Ezry said he seed
3195,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Steve when he fetched little Annie ashore, and she was all right on'y"
3196,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,she was purt nigh past cryin'; and he said Steve had lapped his coat
3197,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"around her and give her to him to take charge of, and he got so"
3198,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,excited over the fight he laid her down betwixt a couple o' logs and
3199,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"kind o' forget about her tel the thing was over, and he went to look"
3200,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"far her, and she was gone. Couldn't a-be'n 'at she'd a-wundered off"
3201,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"her-own-se'f; and it couldn't a-be'n 'at Steve'd take her, 'thout"
3202,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,a-lettin us know it. It was a mighty aggervatin' conclusion to come
3203,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"to, but we had to do it, and that was, Bills must a got ashore"
3204,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,unbeknownst to us and packed her off. Sich a thing wasn't hardly
3205,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"probable, yit it was a thing 'at might be; and after a-talkin' it over"
3206,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,we had to admit 'at it must a-be'n the way of it. But where was Steve?
3207,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"W'y, we argied, he'd discivvered she was gone, and had put out on"
3208,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,track of her 'thout losin' time to stop and explain the thing. The
3209,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"next question was, what did Bills want with her agin? He'd tried to"
3210,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"drownd her onc't. We could ast questions enough, but c'rect answers"
3211,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"was mighty skearce, and we jist concluded 'at the best thing to do was"
3212,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"to put out far the ford, far that was the nighdest place Bills could"
3213,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"cross 'thout a boat, and ef it was him tuck the child he was still on"
3214,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"our side o' the river, o' course. So we struck out far the ford,"
3215,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,a-leav-in' a couple o' men to search up the river. A drizzlin' sort o'
3216,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"rain had set in by this time, and with that and the darkness and the"
3217,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"moanin' of the wind, it made 'bout as lonesome a prospect as a feller"
3218,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,ever wants to go through agin.
3219,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
3220,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,It was jist a-gittin' a little gray-like in the mornin' by the time we
3221,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"reached the ford, but you couldn't hardly see two rods afore you far"
3222,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,the mist and the fog 'at had settled along the river. We looked far
3223,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"tracks, but couldn't make out nuthin'. Thereckly old Ezry punched me"
3224,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"and p'inted out acrost the river. ""What's that?"" he whispers. Jist"
3225,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,'bout half way acrost was somepin' white-like in the worter--couldn't
3226,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,make out what--perfeckly still it was. And I whispered back and told
3227,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"him I guess it wasn't nothin' but a sycamore snag. ""Listen!"" says he;"
3228,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"""Sycamore snags don't make no noise like that!"" And, shore enough, it"
3229,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,was the same moanin' noise we'd heerd the baby makin' when we first
3230,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"got on the track. Sobbin' she was, as though nigh about dead. ""Well,"
3231,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"ef that's Bills,"" says I--""and I reckon ther' hain't no doubt but it"

3234,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,plainer and plainer. It was him; and there he stood breast-high in the
3235,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"worter, a-holdin' the baby on his shoulder like, and a lookin' up"
3236,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"stream, and a-waitin'."
3237,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
3238,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"""What do you make out of it?"" says Ezry. ""What's he waitin' far?"""
3239,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
3240,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,And a strainin' my eyes in the direction he was a-lookin' I seed
3241,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"somepin' a-movin' down the river, and a minute later I'd made out the"
3242,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,old boat a-driftin' down stream; and then of course ever'thing was
3243,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"plain enough: He was waitin' far the boat, and ef he got _that_ he'd"
3244,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,have the same advantage on us he had afore.
3245,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
3246,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"""Boys,"" says I, ""he mustn't git that boat agin! Foller me, and don't"
3247,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"let him git to the shore alive."" And in we plunged. He seed us, but he"
3248,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"never budged, on'y to grab the baby by its little legs, and swing it"
3249,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"out at arms-len'th. ""Stop, there,"" he hollered. ""Stop jist where you"
3250,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,air! Move another inch and I'll drownd this dam young-un afore your

3252,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,Don't move! This thing'll have to rest with a higher power 'n our 'n!

3254,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,
3255,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"Jist then the boat swung up, and Bills grabbed it and rech 'round and"
3256,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"set the baby in it, never a-takin' his eye off o' us, though, far a"
3257,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"minute. ""Now,"" says he, with a sort o' snarlin' laugh, ""I've on'y got"
3258,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"a little while to stay with you, and I want to say a few words afore I"
3259,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"go. I want to tell you fellers, in the first place, 'at you've be'n"
3260,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"_fooled_ in me: I _hain't_ a good feller, now, honest! And ef you're a"
3261,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"little the worse far findin' it out so late in the day, you hain't"
3262,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"none the worse far losin' me so soon--far I'm a-goin' away now, and"
3263,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,any interference with my arrangements 'll on'y give you more trouble;
3264,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,so it's better all around to let me go peaceable and jist while I'm in
3265,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,the notion. I expect it'll be a disapp'intment to some o' you that my

3268,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"name o' 'Williams' onc't to keep from bein' strung up to a lamp-post,"
3269,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,but sich is the facts. I was so extremely unfortunit onc't as to kill
3270,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"a p'ticular friend o' mine, and he forgive me with his dyin' breath,"
3271,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"and told me to run while I could, and be a better man. But he'd"
3272,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"spotted me with a' ugly mark 'at made it kind o' onhandy to git away,"
3273,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"but I did at last; and jist as I was a-gittin' reformed-like, you"
3274,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"fellers had to kick in the traces, and I've made up my mind to hunt"
3275,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"out a more moraler community, where they don't make sich a fuss about"

3280,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"lick--my--God!--and, a minute later, boat and baggage was a-gratin' on"
3281,AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY,"the shore, and a crowd come thrashin' 'crost from tother side to jine"

4000,A WILD IRISHMAN.,Not very many years ago the writer was for some months stationed at
4001,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"South Bend, a thriving little city of northern Indiana, its main"
4002,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"population on the one side of the St. Joseph river, but quite a"
4003,A WILD IRISHMAN.,respectable fraction thereof taking its industrial way to the opposite
4004,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"shore, and there gaining an audience and a hearing in the rather"
4005,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"imposing growth and hurly-burly of its big manufactories, and the"
4006,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"consequent rapid appearance of multitudinous neat cottages, tenement"
4007,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"houses and business blocks. A stranger, entering South Bend proper on"
4008,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"any ordinary day, will be at some loss to account for its prosperous"
4009,A WILD IRISHMAN.,appearance--its flagged and bowldered streets--its handsome mercantile
4010,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"blocks, banks, and business houses generally. Reasoning from cause to"
4011,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"effect, and seeing but a meager sprinkling of people on the streets"
4012,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"throughout the day, and these seeming, for the most part, merely"
4013,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"idlers, and in no wise accessory to the evident thrift and opulence of"
4014,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"their surroundings, the observant stranger will be puzzled at the"
4015,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"situation. But when evening comes, and the outlying foundries,"
4016,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"sewing-machine, wagon, plow, and other ""works,"" together with the"
4017,A WILD IRISHMAN.,paper-mills and all the nameless industries--when the operations of
4018,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"all these are suspended for the day, and the workmen and workwomen"
4019,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"loosed from labor--then, as this vast army suddenly invades and"
4020,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"overflows bridge, roadway, street and lane, the startled stranger will"
4021,A WILD IRISHMAN.,fully comprehend the why and wherefore of the city's high prosperity.
4022,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"And, once acquainted with the people there, the fortunate sojourner"
4023,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"will find no ordinary culture and intelligence, and, as certainly, he"
4024,A WILD IRISHMAN.,will meet with a social spirit and a wholesouled heartiness that will
4025,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"make the place a lasting memory. The town, too, is the home of many"
4026,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"world-known notables, and a host of local celebrities, the chief of"
4027,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"which latter class I found, during my stay there, in the person of"
4028,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"Tommy Stafford, or ""The Wild Irishman"" as everybody called him."
4029,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4030,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""Talk of odd fellows and eccentric characters,"" said Major Blowney, my"
4031,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"employer, one afternoon, ""you must see our 'Wild Irishman' here before"
4032,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"you say you've yet found the queerest, brightest, cleverest chap in"
4033,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"all your travels. What d'ye say, Stockford?"" And the Major paused in"
4034,A WILD IRISHMAN.,his work of charging cartridges for his new breech-loading shotgun and
4035,A WILD IRISHMAN.,turned to await his partner's response.
4036,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4037,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"Stockford, thus addressed, paused above the shield-sign he was"
4038,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"lettering, slowly smiling as he dipped and trailed his pencil through"
4039,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"the ivory black upon a bit of broken glass and said, in his"
4040,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"deliberate, half-absent-minded way,--""Is it Tommy you're telling him"
4041,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"about?"" and then, with a gradual broadening of the smile, he went on,"
4042,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""Well, I should say so. Tommy! What's come of the fellow, anyway? I"
4043,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"haven't seen him since his last bout with the mayor, on his trial for"
4044,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"shakin' up that fast-horse man."""
4045,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4046,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""The fast-horse man got just exactly what he needed, too,"" said the"
4047,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"genial Major, laughing, and mopping his perspiring brow. ""The fellow"
4048,A WILD IRISHMAN.,was barkin' up the wrong stump when he tackled Tommy! Got beat in the
4049,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"trade, at his own game, you know, and wound up by an insult that no"
4050,A WILD IRISHMAN.,Irishman would take; and Tommy just naturally wore out the hall carpet
4051,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"of the old hotel with him!"""
4052,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4053,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""And then collared and led him to the mayor's office himself, they"
4054,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"say!"""
4055,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4056,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""Oh, he did!"" said the Major, with a dash of pride in the"
4057,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"confirmation; ""that's Tommy all over!"""
4058,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4059,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""Funny trial, wasn't it?"" continued the ruminating Stockford."
4060,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4061,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""Wasn't it though?"" laughed the Major."
4062,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4063,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""The porter's testimony: You see, he was for Tommy, of course, and on"
4064,A WILD IRISHMAN.,examination testified that the horse-man struck Tommy first. And there
4065,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"Tommy broke in with: 'He's a-meanin' well, yer Honor, but he's lyin'"
4066,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"to ye--he's lyin' to ye. No livin' man iver struck me first--nor last,"
4067,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"nayther, for the matter o' that!' And I"
4068,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"thought--the--court--would--die!"" concluded the Major, in a like"
4069,A WILD IRISHMAN.,imminent state of merriment.
4070,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4071,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""Yes, and he said if he struck him first,"" supplemented Stockford,"
4072,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""he'd like to know why the horseman was 'wearin' all the black eyes,"
4073,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"and the blood, and the boomps on the head of um!' And it's that talk"
4074,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"of his that got him off with so light a fine!"""
4075,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4076,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""As it always does,"" said the Major, coming to himself abruptly and"
4077,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"looking at his watch. ""Stock', you say you're not going along with our"
4078,A WILD IRISHMAN.,duck-shooting party this time? The old Kankakee is just lousy with 'em
4079,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"this season!"""
4080,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4081,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""Can't go possibly,"" said Stockford, ""not on account of the work at"
4082,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"all, but the folks at home ain't just as well as I'd like to see them,"
4083,A WILD IRISHMAN.,and I'll stay here till they're better. Next time I'll try and be
4084,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"ready for you. Going to take Tommy, of course?"""
4085,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4086,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""Of course! Got to have 'The Wild Irishman' with us! I'm going around"
4087,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"to find him now."" Then turning to me the Major continued, ""Suppose you"
4088,A WILD IRISHMAN.,get on your coat and hat and come along? It's the best chance you'll
4089,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"ever have to meet Tommy. It's late anyhow, and Stockford'll get along"
4090,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"without you. Come on."""
4091,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4092,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""Certainly,"" said Stockford; ""go ahead. And you can take him ducking,"
4093,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"too, if he wants to go."""
4094,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4095,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""But he doesn't want to go--and won't go,"" replied the Major with a"
4096,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"commiserative glance at me. ""Says he doesn't know a duck from a"
4097,A WILD IRISHMAN.,poll-parrot--nor how to load a shotgun--and couldn't hit a house if he
4098,A WILD IRISHMAN.,were inside of it and the door shut. Admits that he nearly killed his
4099,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"uncle once, on the other side of a tree, with a squirrel runnin' down"
4100,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"it. Don't want him along!"""
4101,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4102,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"Reaching the street with the genial Major, he gave me this advice:"
4103,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""Now, when you meet Tommy, you mustn't take all he says for dead"
4104,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"earnest, and you mustn't believe, because he talks loud, and in"
4105,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"italics every other word, that he wants to do all the talking and"
4106,A WILD IRISHMAN.,won't be interfered with. That's the way he's apt to strike folks at
4107,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"first--but it's their mistake, not his. Talk back to him--controvert"
4108,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"him whenever he's aggressive in the utterance of his opinions, and if"
4109,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"you're only honest in the announcement of your own ideas and beliefs,"
4110,A WILD IRISHMAN.,he'll like you all the better for standing by them. He's
4111,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"quick-tempered, and perhaps a trifle sensitive, so share your greater"
4112,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"patience with him, and he'll pay you back by fighting for you at the"
4113,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"drop of the hat. In short, he's as nearly typical of his gallant"
4114,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"country's brave, impetuous, fun-loving individuality as such a"
4115,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"likeness can exist."""
4116,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4117,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""But is he quarrelsome?"" I asked."
4118,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4119,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""Not at all. There's the trouble. If he'd only quarrel there'd be no"
4120,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"harm done. Quarreling's cheap, and Tommy's extravagant. A big"
4121,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"blacksmith here, the other day, kicked some boy out of his shop, and"
4122,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"Tommy, on his cart, happened to be passing at the time; and he just"
4123,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"jumped off without a word, and went in and worked on that fellow for"
4124,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"about three minutes, with such disastrous results that they couldn't"
4125,A WILD IRISHMAN.,tell his shop from a slaughter-house; paid an assault and battery
4126,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"fine, and gave the boy a dollar beside, and the whole thing was a"
4127,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"positive luxury to him. But I guess we'd better drop the subject, for"
4128,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"here's his cart, and here's Tommy. Hi! there, you Far-down 'Irish"
4129,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"Mick!"" called the Major, in affected antipathy, ""been out raiding the"
4130,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"honest farmers' hen-roosts again, have you?"""
4131,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4132,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"We had halted at a corner grocery and produce store, as I took it, and"
4133,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"the smooth-faced, shave-headed man in woolen shirt, short vest, and"
4134,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"suspenderless trousers so boisterously addressed by the Major, was"
4135,A WILD IRISHMAN.,just lifting from the back of his cart a coop of cackling chickens.
4136,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4137,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""Arrah! ye blasted Kerryonian!"" replied the handsome fellow,"
4138,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"depositing the coop on the curb and straightening his tall, slender"
4139,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"figure; ""I were jist thinking of yez and the ducks, and here ye come"
4140,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"quackin' into the prisence of r'yalty, wid yer canvas-back suit upon"
4141,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"ye and the shwim-skins bechuxt yer toes! How air yez, anyhow--and air"
4142,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"we startin' for the Kankakee by the nixt post?"""
4143,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4144,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""We're to start just as soon as we get the boys together,"" said the"
4145,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"Major, shaking hands. ""The crowd's to be at Andrews' by 4, and it's"
4146,A WILD IRISHMAN.,fully that now; so come on at once. We'll go 'round by Munson's and
4147,A WILD IRISHMAN.,have Hi send a boy to look after your horse. Come; and I want to
4148,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"introduce my friend here to you, and we'll all want to smoke and"
4149,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"jabber a little in appropriate seclusion. Come on."" And the impatient"
4150,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"Major had linked arms with his hesitating ally and myself, and was"
4151,A WILD IRISHMAN.,turning the corner of the street.
4152,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4153,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""It's an hour's work I have yet wid the squawkers,"" mildly protested"
4154,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"Tommy, still hanging back and stepping a trifle high; ""but, as one"
4155,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"Irishman would say til another, 'Ye're wrong, but I'm wid ye!'"""
4156,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4157,A WILD IRISHMAN.,And five minutes later the three of us had joined a very jolly party
4158,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"in a snug back room, with"
4159,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4160,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""The chamber walls depicted all around"
4161,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"With portraitures of huntsman, hawk, and hound,"
4162,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"And the hurt deer,"""
4163,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4164,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"and where, as well, drifted over the olfactory intelligence a certain"
4165,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"subtle, warm-breathed aroma, that genially combatted the chill and"
4166,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"darkness of the day without, and, resurrecting long-dead Christmases,"
4167,A WILD IRISHMAN.,brimmed the grateful memory with all comfortable cheer.
4168,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4169,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"A dozen hearty voices greeted the appearance of Tommy and the Major,"
4170,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"the latter adroitly pushing the jovial Irishman to the front, with a"
4171,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"mock-heroic introduction to the general company, at the conclusion of"
4172,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"which Tommy, with his hat tucked under the left elbow, stood bowing"
4173,A WILD IRISHMAN.,with a grace of pose and presence Lord Chesterfield might have
4174,A WILD IRISHMAN.,applauded.
4175,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4176,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""Gintlemen,"" said Tommy, settling back upon his heels and admiringly"
4177,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"contemplating the group; ""Gintlemen, I congratu-late yez wid a pride"

4189,A WILD IRISHMAN.,'Away to the dizhmal shwamp he shpeeds--

4203,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4204,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""The duck-hunters of the Kankakee!"" chorussed the elated party in such"
4205,A WILD IRISHMAN.,musical uproar that for a full minute the voice of the enthusiastic
4206,A WILD IRISHMAN.,Major--who was trying to say something--could not be heard. Then he
4207,A WILD IRISHMAN.,said:
4208,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4209,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""I want to propose that theme--'The Duck-hunters of the Kankakee', for"
4210,A WILD IRISHMAN.,one of Tommy's improvizations. I move we have a song now from Tommy on
4211,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"the 'Duck-hunters of the Kankakee.'"""
4212,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4213,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""Hurra! Hurra! A song from Tommy,"" cried the crowd. ""Make us up a"
4214,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"song, and put us all into it! A song from Tommy! A song! A song!"""
4215,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4216,A WILD IRISHMAN.,There was a queer light in the eye of the Irishman. I observed him
4217,A WILD IRISHMAN.,narrowly--expectantly. Often I had read of this phenomenal art of
4218,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"improvised ballad-singing, but had always remained a little skeptical"
4219,A WILD IRISHMAN.,in regard to the possibility of such a feat. Even in the notable
4220,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"instances of this gift as displayed by the very clever Theodore Hook,"
4221,A WILD IRISHMAN.,I had always half suspected some prior preparation--some adroit
4222,A WILD IRISHMAN.,forecasting of the sequence that seemed the instant inspiration of his
4223,A WILD IRISHMAN.,witty verses.
4224,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4225,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"Here was evidently to be a test example, and I was all alert to mark"
4226,A WILD IRISHMAN.,its minutest detail.
4227,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4228,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"The clamor had subsided, and Tommy had drawn a chair near to and"
4229,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"directly fronting the Major's. His right hand was extended, closely"
4230,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"grasping the right hand of his friend which he scarce perceptibly,"
4231,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"though measuredly, lifted and let fall throughout the length of all"
4232,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"the curious performance. The voice was not unmusical, nor was the"
4233,A WILD IRISHMAN.,quaint old ballad-air adopted by the singer unlovely in the least;
4234,A WILD IRISHMAN.,simply a monotony was evident that accorded with the levity and
4235,A WILD IRISHMAN.,chance-finish of the improvisation--and that the song was improvised
4236,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"on the instant I am certain--though in no wise remarkable, for other"
4237,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"reasons, in rhythmic worth or finish. And while his smiling auditors"
4238,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"all drew nearer, and leant, with parted lips to catch every syllable,"
4239,A WILD IRISHMAN.,the words of the strange melody trailed unhesitatingly into the lines
4240,A WILD IRISHMAN.,literally as here subjoined:
4241,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4242,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""One gloomy day in the airly Fall,"
4243,A WILD IRISHMAN.,Whin the sunshine had no chance at all--
4244,A WILD IRISHMAN.,No chance at all for to gleam and shine
4245,A WILD IRISHMAN.,And lighten up this heart of mine:
4246,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4247,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""'Twas in South Bend, that famous town,"
4248,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"Whilst I were a-strollin' round and round,"

4251,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4252,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""Hurra for the Kankakee! Give it to us, Tommy!"" cried an enthused"
4253,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"voice between verses. ""Now give it to the Major!"" And the song went"
4254,A WILD IRISHMAN.,on:--
4255,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4256,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""There's Major Blowney leads the van,"
4257,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"As crack a shot as an Irishman,--"

4259,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"That his owld shotgun can't destroy!"""
4260,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4261,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"And a half a dozen jubilant palms patted the Major's shoulders, and"
4262,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"his ruddy, good-natured face beamed with delight. ""Now give it to the"
4263,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"rest of 'em, Tommy!"" chuckled the Major. And the song continued:--"
4264,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4265,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""And along wid 'Hank' is Mick Maharr,"
4266,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"And Barney Pince, at 'The Shamrock' bar--"
4267,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"There's Barney Pinch, wid his heart so true;"
4268,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"And the Andrews Brothers they'll go too."""
4269,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4270,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""Hold on, Tommy!"" chipped in one of the Andrews; ""you must give 'the"
4271,A WILD IRISHMAN.,Andrews Brothers' a better advertisement than that! Turn us on a full
4272,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"verse, can't you?"""
4273,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4274,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""Make 'em pay for it if you do!"" said the Major, in an undertone. And"
4275,A WILD IRISHMAN.,Tommy promptly amended:--
4276,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4277,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""O, the Andrews Brothers, they'll be there,"
4278,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"Wid good se-gyars and wine to shpare,--"
4279,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"They'll treat us here on fine champagne,"
4280,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"And whin we're there they 'll treat us again."""
4281,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4282,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"The applause here was vociferous, and only discontinued when a box of"
4283,A WILD IRISHMAN.,Havanas stood open on the table. During the momentary lull thus
4284,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"occasioned, I caught the Major's twinkling eyes glancing evasively"
4285,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"toward me, as he leant whispering some further instructions to Tommy,"
4286,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"who again took up his desultory ballad, while I turned and fled for"
4287,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"the street, catching, however, as I went, and high above the laughter"
4288,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"of the crowd, the satire of this quatrain to its latest line--"
4289,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4290,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""But R-R-Riley he 'll not go, I guess,"
4291,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"Lest he'd get lost in the wil-der-ness,"

4294,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4295,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"It was after six when I reached the hotel, but I had my hair trimmed"
4296,A WILD IRISHMAN.,before I went in to supper. The style of trimming adopted then I still
4297,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"rigidly adhere to, and call it ""the Tommy Stafford stubble-crop."""
4298,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4299,A WILD IRISHMAN.,Ten days passed before I again saw the Major. Immediately upon his
4300,A WILD IRISHMAN.,return--it was late afternoon when I heard of it--I determined to take
4301,A WILD IRISHMAN.,my evening walk out the long street toward his pleasant home and call
4302,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"upon him there. This I did, and found him in a wholesome state of"
4303,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"fatigue, slippers and easy chair, enjoying his pipe on the piazza. Of"
4304,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"course, he was overflowing with happy reminiscences of the hunt--the"
4305,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"wood-and-water-craft--boats--ambushes--decoys, and tramp, and camp,"
4306,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"and so on, without end;--but I wanted to hear him talk of ""The Wild"
4307,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"Irishman""--Tommy; and I think, too, now, that the sagacious Major"
4308,A WILD IRISHMAN.,secretly read my desires all the time. To be utterly frank with the
4309,A WILD IRISHMAN.,reader I will admit that I not only think the Major divined my
4310,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"interest in Tommy, but I know he did; for at last, as though reading"
4311,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"my very thoughts, he abruptly said, after a long pause, in which he"
4312,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"knocked the ashes from his pipe and refilled and lighted it:--""Well,"
4313,A WILD IRISHMAN.,all I know of 'The Wild Irishman' I can tell you in a very few
4314,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"words--that is, if you care at all to listen?"" And the crafty old"
4315,A WILD IRISHMAN.,Major seemed to hesitate.
4316,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4317,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""Go on--go on!"" I said, eagerly."
4318,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4319,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""About forty years ago,"" resumed the Major, placidly, ""in the little,"
4320,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"old, unheard-of town Karnteel, County Tyrone, Province Ulster,"
4321,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"Ireland, Tommy Stafford--in spite of the contrary opinion of his"
4322,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"wretchedly poor parents--was fortunate enough to be born. And here,"
4323,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"again, as I advised you the other day, you must be prepared for"
4324,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"constant surprises in the study of Tommy's character."""
4325,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4326,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""Go on,"" I said; ""I'm prepared for anything."""
4327,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4328,A WILD IRISHMAN.,The Major smiled profoundly and continued:--
4329,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4330,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""Fifteen years ago, when he came to America--and the Lord only knows"
4331,A WILD IRISHMAN.,how he got the passage-money--he brought his widowed mother with him
4332,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"here, and has supported, and is still supporting her. Besides,"" went"
4333,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"on the still secretly smiling Major, ""the fellow has actually found"
4334,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"time, through all his adversities, to pick up quite a smattering of"
4335,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"education, here and there--"""
4336,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4337,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""Poor fellow!"" I broke in, sympathizingly, ""what a pity it is that he"
4338,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"couldn't have had such advantages earlier in life,"" and as I recalled"
4339,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"the broad brogue of the fellow, together with his careless dress,"
4340,A WILD IRISHMAN.,recognizing beneath it all the native talent and brilliancy of a mind
4341,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"of most uncommon worth, I could not restrain a deep sigh of compassion"
4342,A WILD IRISHMAN.,and regret.
4343,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4344,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"The Major was leaning forward in the gathering dusk, and evidently"
4345,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"studying my own face, the expression of which, at that moment, was"
4346,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"very grave and solemn, I am sure. He suddenly threw himself backward"
4347,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"in his chair, in an uncontrollable burst of laughter. ""Oh, I just"
4348,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"can't keep it up any longer,"" he exclaimed."
4349,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4350,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""Keep what up?"" I queried, in a perfect maze of bewilderment and"
4351,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"surprise. ""Keep what up?"" I repeated."
4352,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4353,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""Why, all this twaddle, farce, travesty and by-play regarding Tommy!"
4354,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"You know I warned you, over and over, and you mustn't blame me for the"
4355,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"deception. I never thought you'd take it so in earnest!"" and here the"
4356,A WILD IRISHMAN.,jovial Major again went into convulsions of laughter.
4357,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4358,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""But I don't understand a word of it all,"" I cried, half frenzied with"
4359,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"the gnarl and tangle of the whole affair. ""What 'twaddle, farce and"
4360,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"by-play,' is it anyhow?"" And in my vexation, I found myself on my feet"
4361,A WILD IRISHMAN.,and striding nervously up and down the paved walk that joined the
4362,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"street with the piazza, pausing at last and confronting the Major"
4363,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"almost petulantly. ""Please explain,"" I said, controlling my vexation"
4364,A WILD IRISHMAN.,with an effort.
4365,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4366,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"The Major arose. ""Your striding up and down there reminds me that a"
4367,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"little stroll on the street might do us both good,"" he said. ""Will you"
4368,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"wait until I get a coat and hat?"""
4369,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4370,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"He rejoined me a moment later, and we passed through the open gate;"
4371,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"and saying, ""Let's go down this way,"" he took my arm and turned into a"
4372,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"street, where, cooling as the dusk was, the thick maples lining the"
4373,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"walk, seemed to throw a special shade of tranquility upon us."
4374,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4375,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"""What I meant was""--began the Major, in low, serious voice,--""What I"
4376,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"meant was--simply this: Our friend Tommy, though the truest Irishman"
4377,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"in the world, is a man quite the opposite everyway of the character he"
4378,A WILD IRISHMAN.,has appeared to you. All that rich brogue of his is assumed. Though
4379,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"he's poor, as I told you, when he came here, his native quickness, and"
4380,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"his marvelous resources, tact, judgment, business qualities--all have"
4381,A WILD IRISHMAN.,helped him to the equivalent of a liberal education. His love of the
4382,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"humorous and the ridiculous is unbounded; but he has serious moments,"
4383,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"as well, and at such times is as dignified and refined in speech and"
4384,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"manner as any man you'd find in a thousand. He is a good speaker, can"
4385,A WILD IRISHMAN.,stir a political convention to fomentation when he gets fired up; and
4386,A WILD IRISHMAN.,can write an article for the press that goes spang to the spot. He
4387,A WILD IRISHMAN.,gets into a great many personal encounters of a rather undignified
4388,A WILD IRISHMAN.,character; but they are almost invariably bred of his innate interest
4389,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"in the 'under dog,' and the fire and tow of his impetuous nature."""
4390,A WILD IRISHMAN.,
4391,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"My companion had paused here, and was looking through some printed"
4392,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"slips in his pocket-book. ""I wanted you to see some of the fellow's"
4393,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"articles in print, but I have nothing of importance here--only some of"
4394,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"his 'doggerel,' as he calls it, and you've had a sample of that. But"
4395,A WILD IRISHMAN.,here's a bit of the upper spirit of the man--and still another that
4396,A WILD IRISHMAN.,you should hear him recite. You can keep them both if you care to. The
4397,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"boys all fell in love with that last one, particularly, hearing his"
4398,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"rendition of it. So we had a lot printed, and I have two or three"
4399,A WILD IRISHMAN.,"left. Put these two in your pocket and read at your leisure."""
4400,A WILD IRISHMAN.,

4488,CHAIRLEY BURKE.,
4489,CHAIRLEY BURKE.,"As he spoke I looked up, to first observe that we had paused before a"
4490,CHAIRLEY BURKE.,"handsome square brick residence, centering a beautiful smooth lawn,"
4491,CHAIRLEY BURKE.,its emerald only littered with the light gold of the earliest autumn
4492,CHAIRLEY BURKE.,leaves. On either side of the trim walk that led up from the gate to
4493,CHAIRLEY BURKE.,"the carved stone ballusters of the broad piazza, with its empty easy"
4494,CHAIRLEY BURKE.,"chairs, were graceful vases, frothing over with late blossoms, and"
4495,CHAIRLEY BURKE.,"wreathed with laurel-looking vines; and, luxuriantly lacing the border"
4496,CHAIRLEY BURKE.,"of the pave that turned the further corner of the house, blue, white"
4497,CHAIRLEY BURKE.,"and crimson, pink and violet, went fading in perspective as my gaze"
4498,CHAIRLEY BURKE.,followed the gesture of the Major's.
4499,CHAIRLEY BURKE.,
4500,CHAIRLEY BURKE.,"""Here, come a little further. Now do you see that man there?"""
4501,CHAIRLEY BURKE.,
4502,CHAIRLEY BURKE.,"Yes, I could make out a figure in the deepening dusk--the figure of a"
4503,CHAIRLEY BURKE.,"man on the back stoop--a tired looking man, in his shirt-sleeves, who"
4504,CHAIRLEY BURKE.,"sat upon a low chair--no, not a chair--an empty box. He was leaning"
4505,CHAIRLEY BURKE.,"forward with his elbows on his knees, and the hands dropped limp. He"
4506,CHAIRLEY BURKE.,"was smoking, too, I could barely see his pipe, and but for the odor of"
4507,CHAIRLEY BURKE.,"very strong tobacco, would not have known he had a pipe. Why does the"
4508,CHAIRLEY BURKE.,master of the house permit his servants to so desecrate this beautiful

4511,CHAIRLEY BURKE.,"""Well, shall we go now?"" said the Major."
4512,CHAIRLEY BURKE.,

5100,THE GILDED ROLL.,
5101,THE GILDED ROLL.,"Nosing around in an old box--packed away, and lost to memory for"
5102,THE GILDED ROLL.,"years--an hour ago I found a musty package of gilt paper, or rather, a"
5103,THE GILDED ROLL.,"roll it was, with the green-tarnished gold of the old sheet for the"
5104,THE GILDED ROLL.,outer wrapper. I picked it up mechanically to toss it into some
5105,THE GILDED ROLL.,"obscure corner, when, carelessly lifting it by one end, a child's tin"
5106,THE GILDED ROLL.,whistle dropped therefrom and fell tinkling on the attic floor. It
5107,THE GILDED ROLL.,"lies before me on my writing table now--and so, too, does the roll"
5108,THE GILDED ROLL.,"entire, though now a roll no longer,--for my eager fingers have"
5109,THE GILDED ROLL.,"unrolled the gilded covering, and all its precious contents are spread"
5110,THE GILDED ROLL.,out beneath my hungry eyes.
5111,THE GILDED ROLL.,
5112,THE GILDED ROLL.,"Here is a scroll of ink-written music. I don't read music, but I know"
5113,THE GILDED ROLL.,the dash and swing of the pen that rained it on the page. Here is a
5114,THE GILDED ROLL.,"letter, with the self-same impulse and abandon in every syllable; and"
5115,THE GILDED ROLL.,its melody--however sweet the other--is far more sweet to me. And here
5116,THE GILDED ROLL.,"are other letters like it--three--five--and seven, at least. Bob wrote"
5117,THE GILDED ROLL.,"them from the front, and Billy kept them for me when I went to join"
5118,THE GILDED ROLL.,him. Dear boy! Dear boy!
5119,THE GILDED ROLL.,
5120,THE GILDED ROLL.,Here are some cards of bristol-board. Ah! when Bob came to these there
5121,THE GILDED ROLL.,"were no blotches then. What faces--what expressions! The droll,"
5122,THE GILDED ROLL.,"ridiculous, good-for-nothing genius, with his ""sad mouth,"" as he"
5123,THE GILDED ROLL.,"called it, ""upside down,"" laughing always--at everything, at big"
5124,THE GILDED ROLL.,"rallies, and mass-meetings and conventions, county fairs, and floral"
5125,THE GILDED ROLL.,"halls, booths, watermelon-wagons, dancing-tents, the swing,"
5126,THE GILDED ROLL.,"Daguerrean-car, the ""lung-barometer,"" and the air-gun man. Oh! what a"
5127,THE GILDED ROLL.,"gifted, good-for-nothing boy Bob was in those old days! And here 's a"
5128,THE GILDED ROLL.,picture of a girlish face--a very faded photograph--even fresh from
5129,THE GILDED ROLL.,"""the gallery,"" five and twenty years ago it was a faded thing. But the"
5130,THE GILDED ROLL.,"living face--how bright and clear that was!--for ""Doc,"" Bob's awful"
5131,THE GILDED ROLL.,"name for her, was a pretty girl, and brilliant, clever, lovable every"
5132,THE GILDED ROLL.,way. No wonder Bob fancied her! And you could see some hint of her
5133,THE GILDED ROLL.,"jaunty loveliness in every fairy face he drew, and you could find her"
5134,THE GILDED ROLL.,happy ways and dainty tastes unconsciously assumed in all he did--the
5135,THE GILDED ROLL.,"books he read--the poems he admired, and those he wrote; and, ringing"
5136,THE GILDED ROLL.,"clear and pure and jubilant, the vibrant beauty of her voice could"
5137,THE GILDED ROLL.,"clearly be defined and traced through all his music. Now, there's the"
5138,THE GILDED ROLL.,happy pair of them--Bob and Doc. Make of them just whatever your good
5139,THE GILDED ROLL.,"fancy may dictate, but keep in mind the stern, relentless ways of"
5140,THE GILDED ROLL.,destiny.
5141,THE GILDED ROLL.,
5142,THE GILDED ROLL.,"You are not at the beginning of a novel, only at the threshold of one"
5143,THE GILDED ROLL.,"of a hundred experiences that lie buried in the past, and this"
5144,THE GILDED ROLL.,particular one most happily resurrected by these odds and ends found
5145,THE GILDED ROLL.,in the gilded roll.
5146,THE GILDED ROLL.,
5147,THE GILDED ROLL.,"You see, dating away back, the contents of this package, mainly, were"
5148,THE GILDED ROLL.,hastily gathered together after a week's visit out at the old Mills
5149,THE GILDED ROLL.,"farm; the gilt paper, and the whistle, and the pictures, they were"
5150,THE GILDED ROLL.,"Billy's; the music pages, Bob's, or Doc's; the letters and some other"
5151,THE GILDED ROLL.,manuscripts were mine.
5152,THE GILDED ROLL.,
5153,THE GILDED ROLL.,"The Mills girls were great friends of Doc's, and often came to visit"
5154,THE GILDED ROLL.,her in town; and so Doc often visited the Mills's. This is the way
5155,THE GILDED ROLL.,"that Bob first got out there, and won them all, and ""shaped the thing"""
5156,THE GILDED ROLL.,"for me, as he would put it; and lastly, we had lugged in Billy,--such"
5157,THE GILDED ROLL.,"a handy boy, you know, to hold the horses on picnic excursions, and to"
5158,THE GILDED ROLL.,"watch the carriage and the luncheon, and all that.--""Yes, and,"" Bob"
5159,THE GILDED ROLL.,"would say, ""such a serviceable boy in getting all the fishing tackle"
5160,THE GILDED ROLL.,"in proper order, and digging bait, and promenading in our wake up and"
5161,THE GILDED ROLL.,"down the creek all day, with the minnow-bucket hanging on his arm,"
5162,THE GILDED ROLL.,"don't you know!"""
5163,THE GILDED ROLL.,
5164,THE GILDED ROLL.,"But jolly as the days were, I think jollier were the long evenings at"
5165,THE GILDED ROLL.,"the farm. After the supper in the grove, where, when the weather"
5166,THE GILDED ROLL.,"permitted, always stood the table, ankle-deep in the cool green plush"
5167,THE GILDED ROLL.,"of the sward; and after the lounge upon the grass, and the cigars, and"
5168,THE GILDED ROLL.,"the new fish stories, and the general invoice of the old ones, it was"
5169,THE GILDED ROLL.,"delectable to get back to the girls again, and in the old ""best room"""
5170,THE GILDED ROLL.,hear once more the lilt of the old songs and the stacattoed laughter
5171,THE GILDED ROLL.,of the piano mingling with the alto and falsetto voices of the Mills
5172,THE GILDED ROLL.,"girls, and the gallant soprano of the dear girl Doc."
5173,THE GILDED ROLL.,
5174,THE GILDED ROLL.,"This is the scene I want you to look in upon, as, in fancy, I do"
5175,THE GILDED ROLL.,"now--and here are the materials for it all, husked from the gilded"
5176,THE GILDED ROLL.,roll:
5177,THE GILDED ROLL.,
5178,THE GILDED ROLL.,"Bob, the master, leans at the piano now, and Doc is at the keys, her"
5179,THE GILDED ROLL.,glad face often thrown up sidewise toward his own. His face is
5180,THE GILDED ROLL.,boyish--for there is yet but the ghost of a mustache upon his lip. His
5181,THE GILDED ROLL.,"eyes are dark and clear, of over-size when looking at you, but now"
5182,THE GILDED ROLL.,"their lids are drooped above his violin, whose melody has, for the"
5183,THE GILDED ROLL.,"time, almost smoothed away the upward kinkings of the corners of his"
5184,THE GILDED ROLL.,"mouth. And wonderfully quiet now is every one, and the chords of the"
5185,THE GILDED ROLL.,"piano, too, are low and faltering; and so, at last, the tune itself"
5186,THE GILDED ROLL.,"swoons into the universal hush, and--Bob is rasping, in its stead, the"
5187,THE GILDED ROLL.,"ridiculous, but marvelously perfect imitation of the ""priming"" of a"
5188,THE GILDED ROLL.,"pump, while Billy's hands forget the ""chiggers"" on the bare backs of"
5189,THE GILDED ROLL.,"his feet, as, with clapping palms, he dances round the room in"
5190,THE GILDED ROLL.,"ungovernable spasms of delight. And then we all laugh; and Billy,"
5191,THE GILDED ROLL.,"taking advantage of the general tumult, pulls Bob's head down and"
5192,THE GILDED ROLL.,"whispers, ""Git 'em to stay up 'way late to-night!"" And Bob, perhaps"
5193,THE GILDED ROLL.,"remembering that we go back home to-morrow, winks at the little fellow"
5194,THE GILDED ROLL.,"and whispers, ""You let me manage 'em! Stay up till broad daylight if"
5195,THE GILDED ROLL.,"we take a notion--eh?"" And Billy dances off again in newer glee, while"
5196,THE GILDED ROLL.,the inspired musician is plunking a banjo imitation on his enchanted
5197,THE GILDED ROLL.,"instrument, which is unceremoniously drowned out by a circus-tune from"
5198,THE GILDED ROLL.,Doc that is absolutely inspiring to everyone but the barefooted
5199,THE GILDED ROLL.,"brother, who drops back listlessly to his old position on the floor"
5200,THE GILDED ROLL.,"and sullenly renews operations on his ""chigger"" claims."
5201,THE GILDED ROLL.,
5202,THE GILDED ROLL.,"""Thought you was goin' to have pop-corn to-night all so fast!"" he"
5203,THE GILDED ROLL.,"says, doggedly, in the midst of a momentary lull that has fallen on a"
5204,THE GILDED ROLL.,"game of whist. And then the oldest Mills girl, who thinks cards stupid"
5205,THE GILDED ROLL.,"anyhow, says: ""That's so, Billy; and we're going to have it, too; and"
5206,THE GILDED ROLL.,"right away, for this game's just ending, and I shan't submit to being"
5207,THE GILDED ROLL.,"bored with another. I say 'pop-corn' with Billy! And after that,"" she"
5208,THE GILDED ROLL.,"continues, rising and addressing the party in general, ""we must have"
5209,THE GILDED ROLL.,"another literary and artistic tournament, and that's been in"
5210,THE GILDED ROLL.,contemplation and preparation long enough; so you gentlemen can be
5211,THE GILDED ROLL.,"pulling your wits together for the exercises, while us girls see to"
5212,THE GILDED ROLL.,"the refreshments."""
5213,THE GILDED ROLL.,
5214,THE GILDED ROLL.,"""Have you done anything toward it!"" queries Bob, when the girls are"
5215,THE GILDED ROLL.,"gone, with the alert Billy in their wake."
5216,THE GILDED ROLL.,
5217,THE GILDED ROLL.,"""Just an outline,"" I reply. ""How with you?"""
5218,THE GILDED ROLL.,
5219,THE GILDED ROLL.,"""Clean forgot it--that is, the preparation; but I've got a little old"
5220,THE GILDED ROLL.,"second-hand idea, if you'll all help me out with it, that'll amuse us"
5221,THE GILDED ROLL.,"some, and tickle Billy I'm certain."""
5222,THE GILDED ROLL.,
5223,THE GILDED ROLL.,"So that's agreed upon; and while Bob produces his portfolio, drawing"
5224,THE GILDED ROLL.,"paper, pencils and so on, I turn to my note-book in a dazed way and"
5225,THE GILDED ROLL.,"begin counting my fingers in a depth of profound abstraction, from"
5226,THE GILDED ROLL.,which I am barely aroused by the reappearance of the girls and Billy.
5227,THE GILDED ROLL.,
5228,THE GILDED ROLL.,"""Goody, goody, goody! Bob's goin' to make pictures!"" cries Billy, in"
5229,THE GILDED ROLL.,additional transport to that the cake pop-corn has produced.
5230,THE GILDED ROLL.,
5231,THE GILDED ROLL.,"""Now, you girls,"" says Bob, gently detaching the affectionate Billy"
5232,THE GILDED ROLL.,"from one leg and moving a chair to the table, with a backward glance"
5233,THE GILDED ROLL.,"of intelligence toward the boy,--""you girls are to help us all you"
5234,THE GILDED ROLL.,"can, and we can all work; but, as I'll have all the illustrations to"
5235,THE GILDED ROLL.,"do, I want you to do as many of the verses as you can--that'll be"
5236,THE GILDED ROLL.,"easy, you know,--because the work entire is just to consist of a"
5237,THE GILDED ROLL.,"series of fool-epigrams, such as, for instance.--Listen, Billy:"
5238,THE GILDED ROLL.,
5239,THE GILDED ROLL.,Here lies a young man
5240,THE GILDED ROLL.,Who in childhood began
5241,THE GILDED ROLL.,"To swear, and to smoke, and to drink,--"
5242,THE GILDED ROLL.,In his twentieth year
5243,THE GILDED ROLL.,"He quit swearing and beer,"
5244,THE GILDED ROLL.,"And yet is still smoking, I think."""
5245,THE GILDED ROLL.,
5246,THE GILDED ROLL.,"And the rest of his instructions are delivered in lower tones, that"
5247,THE GILDED ROLL.,"the boy may not hear; and then, all matters seemingly arranged, he"
5248,THE GILDED ROLL.,"turns to the boy with--""And now, Billy, no lookin' over shoulders, you"
5249,THE GILDED ROLL.,"know, or swinging on my chair-back while I'm at work. When the"
5250,THE GILDED ROLL.,"pictures are all finished, then you can take a squint at 'em, and not"
5251,THE GILDED ROLL.,"before. Is that all hunky, now?"""
5252,THE GILDED ROLL.,
5253,THE GILDED ROLL.,"""Oh! who's a-goin' to look over your shoulder--only _Doc_."" And as the"
5254,THE GILDED ROLL.,"radiant Doc hastily quits that very post, and dives for the offending"
5255,THE GILDED ROLL.,"brother, he scrambles under the piano and laughs derisively."
5256,THE GILDED ROLL.,
5257,THE GILDED ROLL.,"And then a silence falls upon the group--a gracious quiet, only"
5258,THE GILDED ROLL.,intruded upon by the very juicy and exuberant munching of an apple
5259,THE GILDED ROLL.,"from a remote fastness of the room, and the occasional thumping of a"
5260,THE GILDED ROLL.,bare heel against the floor.
5261,THE GILDED ROLL.,
5262,THE GILDED ROLL.,At last I close my note-book with a half slam.
5263,THE GILDED ROLL.,
5264,THE GILDED ROLL.,"""That means,"" says Bob, laying down his pencil, and addressing the"
5265,THE GILDED ROLL.,"girls,--""That means he's concluded his poem, and that he's not pleased"
5266,THE GILDED ROLL.,"with it in any manner, and that he intends declining to read it, for"
5267,THE GILDED ROLL.,"that self-acknowledged reason, and that he expects us to believe every"
5268,THE GILDED ROLL.,"affected word of his entire speech--"""
5269,THE GILDED ROLL.,
5270,THE GILDED ROLL.,"""Oh, don't!"" I exclaim."
5271,THE GILDED ROLL.,
5272,THE GILDED ROLL.,"""Then give us the wretched production, in all its hideous deformity!"""
5273,THE GILDED ROLL.,
5274,THE GILDED ROLL.,"And the girls all laugh so sympathetically, and Bob joins them so"
5275,THE GILDED ROLL.,"gently, and yet with a tone, I know, that can be changed so quickly to"
5276,THE GILDED ROLL.,"my further discomfiture, that I arise at once and read, without"
5277,THE GILDED ROLL.,"apology or excuse, this primitive and very callow poem recovered here"
5278,THE GILDED ROLL.,to-day from the gilded roll:

5291,A BACKWARD LOOK.,"From weariness, toil and care,--"
5292,A BACKWARD LOOK.,"My fancies--doubtless, for ventilation--"
5293,A BACKWARD LOOK.,"Left ajar the gates of my mind,--"
5294,A BACKWARD LOOK.,"And Memory, seeing the situation,"
5295,A BACKWARD LOOK.,"Slipped out in street of ""Auld Lang Syne."""
5296,A BACKWARD LOOK.,
5297,A BACKWARD LOOK.,Wandering ever with tireless feet
5298,A BACKWARD LOOK.,"Through scenes of silence, and jubilee"
5299,A BACKWARD LOOK.,Of long-hushed voices; and faces sweet
5300,A BACKWARD LOOK.,Were thronging the shadowy side of the street
5301,A BACKWARD LOOK.,As far as the eye could see;
5302,A BACKWARD LOOK.,"Dreaming again, in anticipation,"
5303,A BACKWARD LOOK.,The same old dreams of our boyhood's days
5304,A BACKWARD LOOK.,"That never come true, from the vague sensation"

5306,A BACKWARD LOOK.,
5307,A BACKWARD LOOK.,Away to the house where I was born!
5308,A BACKWARD LOOK.,And there was the selfsame clock that ticked
5309,A BACKWARD LOOK.,"From the close of dusk to the burst of morn,"
5310,A BACKWARD LOOK.,When life-warm hands plucked the golden corn
5311,A BACKWARD LOOK.,And helped when the apples were picked.
5312,A BACKWARD LOOK.,"And the ""chany-dog"" on the mantel-shelf,"
5313,A BACKWARD LOOK.,"With the gilded collar and yellow eyes,"
5314,A BACKWARD LOOK.,"Looked just as at first, when I hugged myself"
5315,A BACKWARD LOOK.,Sound asleep with the dear surprise.
5316,A BACKWARD LOOK.,
5317,A BACKWARD LOOK.,"And down to the swing in the locust tree,"
5318,A BACKWARD LOOK.,"Where the grass was worn from the trampled ground,"
5319,A BACKWARD LOOK.,"And where ""Eck"" Skinner, ""Old"" Carr, and three"
5320,A BACKWARD LOOK.,Or four such other boys used to be
5321,A BACKWARD LOOK.,"Doin' ""sky-scrapers,"" or ""whirlin' round:"""
5322,A BACKWARD LOOK.,"And again Bob climbed for the bluebird's nest,"
5323,A BACKWARD LOOK.,"And again ""had shows"" in the buggy-shed"
5324,A BACKWARD LOOK.,"Of Guymon's barn, where still, unguessed,"
5325,A BACKWARD LOOK.,The old ghosts romp through the best days dead!
5326,A BACKWARD LOOK.,
5327,A BACKWARD LOOK.,And again I gazed from the old school-room
