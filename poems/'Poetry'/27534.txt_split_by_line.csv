1583,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,"GOLD, gold, gold!"
1584,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,What care we for hunger and cold?
1585,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,"What care we for the moil and strife,"
1586,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,"Or the thousands of foes to health and life,"
1587,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,"When there's gold for the mighty, and gold for the meek,"
1588,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,And gold for whoever shall dare to seek?
1589,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,Untold
1590,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,Is the gold;
1591,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,And it lies in the reach of the man that's bold:
1592,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,In the hands of the man who dares to face
1593,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,"The death in the blast, that blows apace;"
1594,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,That withers the leaves on the forest tree;
1595,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,That fetters with ice all the northern sea;
1596,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,"That chills all the green on the fair earth's breast,"
1597,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,And as certainly kills as the un-stayed pest.
1598,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,It lies in the hands of the man who'd sell
1599,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,His hold on his life for an ice-bound hell.
1600,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,What care we for the fevered brain
1601,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,"That's filled with ravings and thoughts insane,"
1602,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,So long as we hold
1603,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,In our hands the gold?--
1604,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,"The glistening, glittering, ghastly gold"
1605,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,That comes at the end of the hunger and cold;
1606,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,That comes at the end of the awful thirst;
1607,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,That comes through the pain and torture accurst
1608,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,"Of limbs that are racked and minds o'erthrown,"
1609,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,"The gold lies there and is all our own,"
1610,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,"Be we mighty or meek,"
1611,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,If we do but seek.
1612,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,For the hunger is sweet and the cold is fair
1613,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,To the man whose riches are past compare;
1614,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,"And the o'erthrown mind is as good as sane,"
1615,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,"And a joy to the limbs is the racking pain,"
1616,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,If the gold is there.
1617,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,"And they say, if you fail, in your dying day"
1618,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,"All the tears, all the troubles, are wiped away"
1619,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,By the fever-thought of your shattered mind
1620,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,That a cruel world has at last grown kind;
1621,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,"That your hands o'errun with the clinking gold,"
1622,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,"With nuggets of weight and of worth untold,"
1623,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,And your vacant eyes
1624,_THE GOLD-SEEKERS_,Gloat o'er the riches of Paradise!
