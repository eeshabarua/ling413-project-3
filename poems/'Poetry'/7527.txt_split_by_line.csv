814,CREDITS.,
815,CREDITS.,"It has been more than a decade since ""The Little Daisy Girl and other"
816,CREDITS.,"poems"" was written. A few comments seem worth noting."
817,CREDITS.,
818,CREDITS.,"Satan's Taunt is a riddle to be solved, and it is also an allegory about"
819,CREDITS.,"how Satan twists the true meaning of things, seeking to deceive us into"
820,CREDITS.,looking at false or potentially confusing or misleading surface values.
821,CREDITS.,"Since the poem was written, the darker side of personal and mainframe"
822,CREDITS.,computers has given the poem a more sinister meaning. Can you guess the
823,CREDITS.,"answer to the riddle, and see how the false values given in the poem"
824,CREDITS.,"could be seen superficially? If you're not sure, ask a friend, or take"
825,CREDITS.,a good long look at the illustration with the weed in the middle and the
826,CREDITS.,"numbers in two columns on both sides. Satan is a weed, vainglorious and"
827,CREDITS.,"vile, with poison for blood."
828,CREDITS.,
829,CREDITS.,The BIO-LOVE illustration for The Boy with Sad Eyes is a combination of
830,CREDITS.,two universally known and recognized images; the 'smiley' face and the
831,CREDITS.,'BIO-HAZARD' symbol

837,CREDITS.,"kitty's name was Sweets, and his fur was peach-colored, and yes, we"
838,CREDITS.,and our church firmly believe that Sweets is in heaven.

841,CREDITS.,The Demons Burning Hiking Chant.
842,CREDITS.,
843,CREDITS.,"This was dreamed up one day as a nice little hiking jig, suitable for"
844,CREDITS.,children or adults. The words are recited in time to walking. The words
845,CREDITS.,"in parentheses are alternate lines, or duplicate lines if more than one"
846,CREDITS.,person is doing this and you want some variety. It's a great spiritual
847,CREDITS.,"morale-builder, and a surprising amount of fun.  In place of the last"
848,CREDITS.,"word, there may be others not listed that you can substitute instead,"
849,CREDITS.,"such as 'die', 'flee', and so on. Be prepared to see more youthful"
850,CREDITS.,"enthusiasts wear out the older ones, as there's no set time limit on"
851,CREDITS.,how long you keep at it. Happy hiking!
