118,THE TRUMPET,
119,THE TRUMPET,"RISE up, rise up,"
120,THE TRUMPET,"And, as the trumpet blowing"
121,THE TRUMPET,"Chases the dreams of men,"
122,THE TRUMPET,As the dawn glowing
123,THE TRUMPET,The stars that left unlit
124,THE TRUMPET,"The land and water,"
125,THE TRUMPET,Rise up and scatter
126,THE TRUMPET,The dew that covers
127,THE TRUMPET,The print of last night's lovers--
128,THE TRUMPET,"Scatter it, scatter it!"
129,THE TRUMPET,
130,THE TRUMPET,While you are listening
131,THE TRUMPET,"To the clear horn,"
132,THE TRUMPET,"Forget, men, everything"
133,THE TRUMPET,"On this earth newborn,"
134,THE TRUMPET,Except that it is lovelier
135,THE TRUMPET,Than any mysteries.
136,THE TRUMPET,Open your eyes to the air
137,THE TRUMPET,That has washed the eyes of the stars
138,THE TRUMPET,Through all the dewy night:
139,THE TRUMPET,"Up with the light,"
140,THE TRUMPET,To the old wars;
141,THE TRUMPET,"Arise, arise!"
142,THE TRUMPET,

144,THE SIGN-POST,THE SIGN-POST
145,THE SIGN-POST,
146,THE SIGN-POST,THE dim sea glints chill. The white sun is shy.
147,THE SIGN-POST,"And the skeleton weeds and the never-dry,"
148,THE SIGN-POST,"Rough, long grasses keep white with frost"
149,THE SIGN-POST,At the hilltop by the finger-post;
150,THE SIGN-POST,The smoke of the traveller's-joy is puffed
151,THE SIGN-POST,Over hawthorn berry and hazel tuft.
152,THE SIGN-POST,
153,THE SIGN-POST,I read the sign. Which way shall I go?
154,THE SIGN-POST,A voice says: You would not have doubted so
155,THE SIGN-POST,At twenty. Another voice gentle with scorn
156,THE SIGN-POST,Says: At twenty you wished you had never been born.
157,THE SIGN-POST,
158,THE SIGN-POST,One hazel lost a leaf of gold
159,THE SIGN-POST,"From a tuft at the tip, when the first voice told"
160,THE SIGN-POST,The other he wished to know what 'twould be
161,THE SIGN-POST,"To be sixty by this same post. ""You shall see,"""
162,THE SIGN-POST,He laughed--and I had to join his laughter--
163,THE SIGN-POST,"""You shall see; but either before or after,"
164,THE SIGN-POST,"Whatever happens, it must befall,"
165,THE SIGN-POST,A mouthful of earth to remedy all
166,THE SIGN-POST,Regrets and wishes shall freely be given;
167,THE SIGN-POST,And if there be a flaw in that heaven
168,THE SIGN-POST,"'Twill be freedom to wish, and your wish may be"
169,THE SIGN-POST,"To be here or anywhere talking to me,"
170,THE SIGN-POST,"No matter what the weather, on earth,"
171,THE SIGN-POST,"At any age between death and birth,--"
172,THE SIGN-POST,"To see what day or night can be,"
173,THE SIGN-POST,"The sun and the frost, the land and the sea,"
174,THE SIGN-POST,"Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring,--"
175,THE SIGN-POST,"With a poor man of any sort, down to a king,"
176,THE SIGN-POST,Standing upright out in the air
177,THE SIGN-POST,"Wondering where he shall journey, O where?"""

180,TEARS,TEARS
181,TEARS,
182,TEARS,IT seems I have no tears left. They should have fallen--
183,TEARS,"Their ghosts, if tears have ghosts, did fall--that day"
184,TEARS,"When twenty hounds streamed by me, not yet combed"
185,TEARS,out
186,TEARS,But still all equals in their rage of gladness
187,TEARS,"Upon the scent, made one, like a great dragon"
188,TEARS,In Blooming Meadow that bends towards the sun
189,TEARS,And once bore hops: and on that other day
190,TEARS,When I stepped out from the double-shadowed Tower
191,TEARS,"Into an April morning, stirring and sweet"
192,TEARS,And warm. Strange solitude was there and silence.
193,TEARS,A mightier charm than any in the Tower
194,TEARS,Possessed the courtyard. They were changing guard
195,TEARS,"Soldiers in line, young English countrymen,"
196,TEARS,"Fair-haired and ruddy, in white tunics. Drums"
197,TEARS,"And fifes were playing ""The British Grenadiers""."
198,TEARS,"The men, the music piercing that solitude"
199,TEARS,"And silence, told me truths I had not dreamed"
200,TEARS,And have forgotten since their beauty passed.

203,TWO PEWITS,TWO PEWITS
204,TWO PEWITS,
205,TWO PEWITS,UNDER the after-sunset sky
206,TWO PEWITS,"Two pewits sport and cry,"
207,TWO PEWITS,More white than is the moon on high
208,TWO PEWITS,Riding the dark surge silently;
209,TWO PEWITS,More black than earth. Their cry
210,TWO PEWITS,Is the one sound under the sky.
211,TWO PEWITS,"They alone move, now low, now high,"
212,TWO PEWITS,And merrily they cry
213,TWO PEWITS,"To the mischievous Spring sky,"
214,TWO PEWITS,"Plunging earthward, tossing high,"
215,TWO PEWITS,Over the ghost who wonders why
216,TWO PEWITS,"So merrily they cry and fly,"
217,TWO PEWITS,"Nor choose 'twixt earth and sky,"
218,TWO PEWITS,While the moon's quarter silently
219,TWO PEWITS,"Rides, and earth rests as silently."
220,TWO PEWITS,
221,TWO PEWITS,
222,THE MANOR FARM,THE MANOR FARM
223,THE MANOR FARM,
224,THE MANOR FARM,THE rock-like mud unfroze a little and rills
225,THE MANOR FARM,Ran and sparkled down each side of the road
226,THE MANOR FARM,Under the catkins wagging in the hedge.
227,THE MANOR FARM,"But earth would have her sleep out, spite of the sun;"
228,THE MANOR FARM,Nor did I value that thin gilding beam
229,THE MANOR FARM,More than a pretty February thing
230,THE MANOR FARM,"Till I came down to the old Manor Farm,"
231,THE MANOR FARM,"And church and yew-tree opposite, in age"
232,THE MANOR FARM,Its equals and in size. The church and yew
233,THE MANOR FARM,And farmhouse slept in a Sunday silentness.
234,THE MANOR FARM,"The air raised not a straw. The steep farm roof,"
235,THE MANOR FARM,"With tiles duskily glowing, entertained"
236,THE MANOR FARM,The mid-day sun; and up and down the roof
237,THE MANOR FARM,White pigeons nestled. There was no sound but one.
238,THE MANOR FARM,Three cart-horses were looking over a gate
239,THE MANOR FARM,"Drowsily through their forelocks, swishing their tails"
240,THE MANOR FARM,"Against a fly, a solitary fly."
241,THE MANOR FARM,
242,THE MANOR FARM,The Winter's cheek flushed as if he had drained
243,THE MANOR FARM,"Spring, Summer, and Autumn at a draught"
244,THE MANOR FARM,And smiled quietly. But 'twas not Winter--
245,THE MANOR FARM,Rather a season of bliss unchangeable
246,THE MANOR FARM,Awakened from farm and church where it had lain
247,THE MANOR FARM,Safe under tile and thatch for ages since
248,THE MANOR FARM,"This England, Old already, was called Merry."
249,THE MANOR FARM,
250,THE MANOR FARM,
251,THE OWL,THE OWL
252,THE OWL,
253,THE OWL,"DOWNHILL I came, hungry, and yet not starved;"
254,THE OWL,"Cold, yet had heat within me that was proof"
255,THE OWL,"Against the North wind; tired, yet so that rest"
256,THE OWL,Had seemed the sweetest thing under a roof.
257,THE OWL,
258,THE OWL,"Then at the inn I had food, fire, and rest,"
259,THE OWL,"Knowing how hungry, cold, and tired was I."
260,THE OWL,All of the night was quite barred out except
261,THE OWL,"An owl's cry, a most melancholy cry"
262,THE OWL,
263,THE OWL,"Shaken out long and clear upon the hill,"
264,THE OWL,"No merry note, nor cause of merriment,"
265,THE OWL,But one telling me plain what I escaped
266,THE OWL,"And others could not, that night, as in I went."
267,THE OWL,
268,THE OWL,"And salted was my food, and my repose,"
269,THE OWL,"Salted and sobered, too, by the bird's voice"
270,THE OWL,"Speaking for all who lay under the stars,"
271,THE OWL,"Soldiers and poor, unable to rejoice."
272,THE OWL,
273,THE OWL,
274,SWEDES,SWEDES
275,SWEDES,
276,SWEDES,THEY have taken the gable from the roof of clay
277,SWEDES,On the long swede pile. They have let in the sun
278,SWEDES,To the white and gold and purple of curled fronds
279,SWEDES,Unsunned. It is a sight more tender-gorgeous
280,SWEDES,At the wood-corner where Winter moans and drips
281,SWEDES,"Than when, in the Valley of the Tombs of Kings,"
282,SWEDES,A boy crawls down into a Pharaoh's tomb
283,SWEDES,"And, first of Christian men, beholds the mummy,"
284,SWEDES,"God and monkey, chariot and throne and vase,"
285,SWEDES,"Blue pottery, alabaster, and gold."
286,SWEDES,
287,SWEDES,But dreamless long-dead Amen-hotep lies.
288,SWEDES,"This is a dream of Winter, sweet as Spring."
289,SWEDES,
290,SWEDES,
291,WILL YOU COME?,WILL YOU COME?
292,WILL YOU COME?,
293,WILL YOU COME?,WILL you come?
294,WILL YOU COME?,Will you come?
295,WILL YOU COME?,Will you ride
296,WILL YOU COME?,So late
297,WILL YOU COME?,At my side?
298,WILL YOU COME?,"O, will you come?"
299,WILL YOU COME?,
300,WILL YOU COME?,Will you come?
301,WILL YOU COME?,Will you come
302,WILL YOU COME?,If the night
303,WILL YOU COME?,"Has a moon,"
304,WILL YOU COME?,Full and bright?
305,WILL YOU COME?,"O, will you come?"
306,WILL YOU COME?,
307,WILL YOU COME?,Would you come?
308,WILL YOU COME?,Would you come
309,WILL YOU COME?,If the noon
310,WILL YOU COME?,"Gave light,"
311,WILL YOU COME?,Not the moon?
312,WILL YOU COME?,"Beautiful, would you come?"
313,WILL YOU COME?,
314,WILL YOU COME?,Would you have come?
315,WILL YOU COME?,Would you have come
316,WILL YOU COME?,"Without scorning,"
317,WILL YOU COME?,Had it been
318,WILL YOU COME?,Still morning?
319,WILL YOU COME?,"Beloved, would you have come?"
320,WILL YOU COME?,
321,WILL YOU COME?,If you come
322,WILL YOU COME?,Haste and come.
323,WILL YOU COME?,Owls have cried:
324,WILL YOU COME?,It grows dark
325,WILL YOU COME?,To ride.
326,WILL YOU COME?,"Beloved, beautiful, come."
327,WILL YOU COME?,
328,WILL YOU COME?,
329,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS
330,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,
331,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,As the team's head-brass flashed out on the turn
332,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,The lovers disappeared into the wood.
333,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,I sat among the boughs of the fallen elm
334,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,"That strewed an angle of the fallow, and"
335,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,Watched the plough narrowing a yellow square
336,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,Of charlock. Every time the horses turned
337,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,"Instead of treading me down, the ploughman leaned"
338,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,"Upon the handles to say or ask a word,"
339,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,"About the weather, next about the war."
340,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,"Scraping the share he faced towards the wood,"
341,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,And screwed along the furrow till the brass flashed
342,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,Once more.
343,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,
344,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,The blizzard felled the elm whose crest
345,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,"I sat in, by a woodpecker's round hole,"
346,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,"The ploughman said. ""When will they take it away?"""
347,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,"""When the war's over."" So the talk began--"
348,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,"One minute and an interval of ten,"
349,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,A minute more and the same interval.
350,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,"""Have you been out?"" ""No."" ""And don't want"
351,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,"to, perhaps?"""
352,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,"""If I could only come back again, I should."
353,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,I could spare an arm. I shouldn't want to lose
354,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,"A leg. If I should lose my head, why, so,"
355,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,I should want nothing more. . . . Have many gone
356,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,"From here?"" ""Yes."" ""Many lost?"" ""Yes:"
357,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,good few.
358,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,Only two teams work on the farm this year.
359,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,One of my mates is dead. The second day
360,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,"In France they killed him. It was back in March,"
361,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,"The very night of the blizzard, too. Now if"
362,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,"He had stayed here we should have moved the tree."""
363,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,"""And I should not have sat here. Everything"
364,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,Would have been different. For it would have been
365,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,"Another world."" ""Ay, and a better, though"
366,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,"If we could see all all might seem good."" Then"
367,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,The lovers came out of the wood again:
368,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,The horses started and for the last time
369,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,I watched the clods crumble and topple over
370,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,After the ploughshare and the stumbling team.
371,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,
372,AS THE TEAM'S HEAD-BRASS,
373,THAW,THAW
374,THAW,
375,THAW,OVER the land freckled with snow half-thawed
376,THAW,The speculating rooks at their nests cawed
377,THAW,"And saw from elm-tops, delicate as flower of grass,"
378,THAW,"What we below could not see, Winter pass."
379,THAW,

381,INTERVAL,INTERVAL
382,INTERVAL,
383,INTERVAL,GONE the wild day:
384,INTERVAL,A wilder night
385,INTERVAL,Coming makes way
386,INTERVAL,For brief twilight.
387,INTERVAL,
388,INTERVAL,Where the firm soaked road
389,INTERVAL,Mounts and is lost
390,INTERVAL,In the high beech-wood
391,INTERVAL,It shines almost.
392,INTERVAL,
393,INTERVAL,The beeches keep
394,INTERVAL,"A stormy rest,"
395,INTERVAL,Breathing deep
396,INTERVAL,Of wind from the west.
397,INTERVAL,
398,INTERVAL,"The wood is black,"
399,INTERVAL,With a misty steam.
400,INTERVAL,"Above, the cloud pack"
401,INTERVAL,Breaks for one gleam.
402,INTERVAL,
403,INTERVAL,But the woodman's cot
404,INTERVAL,By the ivied trees
405,INTERVAL,Awakens not
406,INTERVAL,To light or breeze.
407,INTERVAL,
408,INTERVAL,It smokes aloft
409,INTERVAL,Unwavering:
410,INTERVAL,It hunches soft
411,INTERVAL,Under storm's wing.
412,INTERVAL,
413,INTERVAL,It has no care
414,INTERVAL,For gleam or gloom:
415,INTERVAL,It stays there
416,INTERVAL,"While I shall roam,"
417,INTERVAL,
418,INTERVAL,"Die, and forget"
419,INTERVAL,"The hill of trees,"
420,INTERVAL,"The gleam, the wet,"
421,INTERVAL,This roaring peace.
422,INTERVAL,
423,INTERVAL,
424,LIKE THE TOUCH OF RAIN,LIKE THE TOUCH OF RAIN
425,LIKE THE TOUCH OF RAIN,
426,LIKE THE TOUCH OF RAIN,LIKE the touch of rain she was
427,LIKE THE TOUCH OF RAIN,On a man's flesh and hair and eyes
428,LIKE THE TOUCH OF RAIN,When the joy of walking thus
429,LIKE THE TOUCH OF RAIN,Has taken him by surprise:
430,LIKE THE TOUCH OF RAIN,
431,LIKE THE TOUCH OF RAIN,"With the love of the storm he burns,"
432,LIKE THE TOUCH OF RAIN,"He sings, he laughs, well I know how,"
433,LIKE THE TOUCH OF RAIN,But forgets when he returns
434,LIKE THE TOUCH OF RAIN,"As I shall not forget her ""Go now."""
435,LIKE THE TOUCH OF RAIN,
436,LIKE THE TOUCH OF RAIN,Those two words shut a door
437,LIKE THE TOUCH OF RAIN,Between me and the blessed rain
438,LIKE THE TOUCH OF RAIN,That was never shut before
439,LIKE THE TOUCH OF RAIN,And will not open again.
440,LIKE THE TOUCH OF RAIN,
441,LIKE THE TOUCH OF RAIN,
442,THE PATH,THE PATH
443,THE PATH,
444,THE PATH,"RUNNING along a bank, a parapet"
445,THE PATH,That saves from the precipitous wood below
446,THE PATH,"The level road, there is a path. It serves"
447,THE PATH,"Children for looking down the long smooth steep,"
448,THE PATH,"Between the legs of beech and yew, to where"
449,THE PATH,A fallen tree checks the sight: while men and women
450,THE PATH,Content themselves with the road and what they see
451,THE PATH,"Over the bank, and what the children tell."
452,THE PATH,"The path, winding like silver, trickles on,"
453,THE PATH,Bordered and even invaded by thinnest moss
454,THE PATH,That tries to cover roots and crumbling chalk
455,THE PATH,"With gold, olive, and emerald, but in vain."
456,THE PATH,The children wear it. They have flattened the bank
457,THE PATH,"On top, and silvered it between the moss"
458,THE PATH,"With the current of their feet, year after year."
459,THE PATH,"But the road is houseless, and leads not to school."
460,THE PATH,"To see a child is rare there, and the eye"
461,THE PATH,"Has but the road, the wood that overhangs"
462,THE PATH,"And underyawns it, and the path that looks"
463,THE PATH,As if it led on to some legendary
464,THE PATH,Or fancied place where men have wished to go
465,THE PATH,"And stay; till, sudden, it ends where the wood ends."
466,THE PATH,
467,THE PATH,
468,THE COMBE,THE COMBE
469,THE COMBE,
470,THE COMBE,"THE Combe was ever dark, ancient and dark."
471,THE COMBE,"Its mouth is stopped with bramble, thorn, and briar;"
472,THE COMBE,And no one scrambles over the sliding chalk
473,THE COMBE,By beech and yew and perishing juniper
474,THE COMBE,"Down the half precipices of its sides, with roots"
475,THE COMBE,"And rabbit holes for steps. The sun of Winter,"
476,THE COMBE,"The moon of Summer, and all the singing birds"
477,THE COMBE,"Except the missel-thrush that loves juniper,"
478,THE COMBE,Are quite shut out. But far more ancient and dark

925,LOB,"One with another, as he loved the earth."
926,LOB,"""The man may be like Button, or Walker, or"
927,LOB,"Like Bottlesford, that you want, but far more"
928,LOB,He sounds like one I saw when I was a child.
929,LOB,I could almost swear to him. The man was wild
930,LOB,And wandered. His home was where he was free.
931,LOB,Everybody has met one such man as he.
932,LOB,Does he keep clear old paths that no one uses
933,LOB,But once a life-time when he loves or muses?
934,LOB,"He is English as this gate, these flowers, this mire."
935,LOB,And when at eight years old Lob-lie-by-the-fire
936,LOB,"Came in my books, this was the man I saw."
937,LOB,"He has been in England as long as dove and daw,"
938,LOB,"Calling the wild cherry tree the merry tree,"
939,LOB,The rose campion Bridget-in-her-bravery;
940,LOB,"And in a tender mood he, as I guess,"
941,LOB,"Christened one flower Love-in-idleness,"
942,LOB,And while he walked from Exeter to Leeds
943,LOB,One April called all cuckoo-flowers Milkmaids.
944,LOB,"From him old herbal Gerard learnt, as a boy,"
945,LOB,To name wild clematis the Traveller's-joy.
946,LOB,Our blackbirds sang no English till his ear
947,LOB,Told him they called his Jan Toy 'Pretty dear.'
948,LOB,"(She was Jan Toy the Lucky, who, having lost"
949,LOB,"A shilling, and found a penny loaf, rejoiced.)"
950,LOB,For reasons of his own to him the wren
951,LOB,Is Jenny Pooter. Before all other men
952,LOB,'Twas he first called the Hog's Back the Hog's Back.
953,LOB,That Mother Dunch's Buttocks should not lack
954,LOB,Their name was his care. He too could explain
955,LOB,Totteridge and Totterdown and Juggler's Lane:
956,LOB,"He knows, if anyone. Why Tumbling Bay,"
957,LOB,"Inland in Kent, is called so, he might say."
958,LOB,
959,LOB,"""But little he says compared with what he does."
960,LOB,If ever a sage troubles him he will buzz
961,LOB,Like a beehive to conclude the tedious fray:
962,LOB,"And the sage, who knows all languages, runs away."
963,LOB,"Yet Lob has thirteen hundred names for a fool,"
964,LOB,And though he never could spare time for school
965,LOB,"To unteach what the fox so well expressed,"
966,LOB,"On biting the cock's head off,--Quietness is best,--"
967,LOB,He can talk quite as well as anyone
968,LOB,After his thinking is forgot and done.
969,LOB,"He first of all told someone else's wife,"
970,LOB,For a farthing she'd skin a flint and spoil a knife
971,LOB,Worth sixpence skinning it. She heard him speak:
972,LOB,'She had a face as long as a wet week'
973,LOB,"Said he, telling the tale in after years."
974,LOB,"With blue smock and with gold rings in his ears,"
975,LOB,"Sometimes he is a pedlar, not too poor"
976,LOB,To keep his wit. This is tall Tom that bore
977,LOB,"The logs in, and with Shakespeare in the hall"
978,LOB,"Once talked, when icicles hung by the wall."
979,LOB,As Herne the Hunter he has known hard times.
980,LOB,On sleepless nights he made up weather rhymes
981,LOB,"Which others spoilt. And, Hob being then his name,"
982,LOB,He kept the hog that thought the butcher came
983,LOB,"To bring his breakfast 'You thought wrong,' said Hob."
984,LOB,"When there were kings in Kent this very Lob,"
985,LOB,"Whose sheep grew fat and he himself grew merry,"
986,LOB,Wedded the king's daughter of Canterbury;
987,LOB,"For he alone, unlike squire, lord, and king,"
988,LOB,Watched a night by her without slumbering;
989,LOB,He kept both waking. When he was but a lad
990,LOB,"He won a rich man's heiress, deaf, dumb, and sad,"
991,LOB,By rousing her to laugh at him. He carried
992,LOB,His donkey on his back. So they were married.
993,LOB,And while he was a little cobbler's boy
994,LOB,He tricked the giant coming to destroy
995,LOB,Shrewsbury by flood. 'And how far is it yet?'
996,LOB,The giant asked in passing. 'I forget;
997,LOB,But see these shoes I've worn out on the road
998,LOB,And we're not there yet.' He emptied out his load
999,LOB,Of shoes for mending. The giant let fall from his spade
1000,LOB,"The earth for damming Severn, and thus made"
1001,LOB,The Wrekin hill; and little Ercall hill
1002,LOB,Rose where the giant scraped his boots. While still
1003,LOB,"So young, our Jack was chief of Gotham's sages."
1004,LOB,"But long before he could have been wise, ages"
1005,LOB,"Earlier than this, while he grew thick and strong"
1006,LOB,"And ate his bacon, or, at times, sang a song"
1007,LOB,"And merely smelt it, as Jack the giant-killer"
1008,LOB,"He made a name. He too ground up the miller,"
1009,LOB,The Yorkshireman who ground men's bones for flour.
1010,LOB,
1011,LOB,"""Do you believe Jack dead before his hour?"
1012,LOB,"Or that his name is Walker, or Bottlesford,"
1013,LOB,"Or Button, a mere clown, or squire, or lord?"
1014,LOB,"The man you saw,--Lob-lie-by-the-fire, Jack Cade,"
1015,LOB,"Jack Smith, Jack Moon, poor Jack of every trade,"
1016,LOB,"Young Jack, or old Jack, or Jack What-d'ye-call,"
1017,LOB,"Jack-in-the-hedge, or Robin-run-by-the-wall,"
1018,LOB,"Robin Hood, Ragged Robin, lazy Bob,"
1019,LOB,"One of the lords of No Man's Land, good Lob,--"
1020,LOB,"Although he was seen dying at Waterloo,"
1021,LOB,"Hastings, Agincourt, and Sedgemoor too,--"
1022,LOB,Lives yet. He never will admit he is dead
1023,LOB,"Till millers cease to grind men's bones for bread,"
1024,LOB,Not till our weathercock crows once again
1025,LOB,And I remove my house out of the lane
1026,LOB,"On to the road."" With this he disappeared"
1027,LOB,In hazel and thorn tangled with old-man's-beard.
1028,LOB,"But one glimpse of his back, as there he stood,"
1029,LOB,"Choosing his way, proved him of old Jack's blood"
1030,LOB,"Young Jack perhaps, and now a Wiltshireman"
1031,LOB,As he has oft been since his days began.

1102,MAY 23,"And never will be while May is May,--"
1103,MAY 23,"The third, and not the last of its kind;"
1104,MAY 23,But though fair and clear the two behind
1105,MAY 23,Seemed pursued by tempests overpast;
1106,MAY 23,And the morrow with fear that it could not last
1107,MAY 23,Was spoiled. To-day ere the stones were warm
1108,MAY 23,Five minutes of thunderstorm
1109,MAY 23,"Dashed it with rain, as if to secure,"
1110,MAY 23,"By one tear, its beauty the luck to endure."
1111,MAY 23,
1112,MAY 23,At mid-day then along the lane
1113,MAY 23,"Old Jack Noman appeared again,"
1114,MAY 23,"Jaunty and old, crooked and tall,"
1115,MAY 23,"And stopped and grinned at me over the wall,"
1116,MAY 23,With a cowslip bunch in his button-hole
1117,MAY 23,And one in his cap. Who could say if his roll
1118,MAY 23,"Came from flints in the road, the weather, or ale?"
1119,MAY 23,He was welcome as the nightingale.
1120,MAY 23,Not an hour of the sun had been wasted on Jack
1121,MAY 23,"""I've got my Indian complexion back"""
1122,MAY 23,"Said he. He was tanned like a harvester,"
1123,MAY 23,"Like his short clay pipe, like the leaf and bur"
1124,MAY 23,"That clung to his coat from last night's bed,"
1125,MAY 23,Like the ploughland crumbling red.
1126,MAY 23,Fairer flowers were none on the earth
1127,MAY 23,"Than his cowslips wet with the dew of their birth,"
1128,MAY 23,Or fresher leaves than the cress in his basket.
1129,MAY 23,"""Where did they come from, Jack?"" ""Don't ask it,"
1130,MAY 23,"And you'll be told no lies."" ""Very well:"
1131,MAY 23,"Then I can't buy."" ""I don't want to sell."
1132,MAY 23,"Take them and these flowers, too, free."
1133,MAY 23,Perhaps you have something to give me?
1134,MAY 23,Wait till next time. The better the day . . .
1135,MAY 23,"The Lord couldn't make a better, I say;"
1136,MAY 23,"If he could, he never has done."""
1137,MAY 23,"So off went Jack with his roll-walk-run,"
1138,MAY 23,Leaving his cresses from Oakshott rill
1139,MAY 23,And his cowslips from Wheatham hill.
1140,MAY 23,
1141,MAY 23,'Twas the first day that the midges bit;
1142,MAY 23,"But though they bit me, I was glad of it:"
1143,MAY 23,"Of the dust in my face, too, I was glad."
1144,MAY 23,Spring could do nothing to make me sad.
1145,MAY 23,Bluebells hid all the ruts in the copse.
1146,MAY 23,"The elm seeds lay in the road like hops,"
1147,MAY 23,"That fine day, May the twenty-third,"

1156,THE GLORY,That tempts me on to something sweeter than love;
1157,THE GLORY,White clouds ranged even and fair as new-mown hay;
1158,THE GLORY,"The heat, the stir, the sublime vacancy"
1159,THE GLORY,Of sky and meadow and forest and my own heart:--

1161,THE GLORY,"All I can ever do, all I can be,"
1162,THE GLORY,"Beside the lovely of motion, shape, and hue,"
1163,THE GLORY,The happiness I fancy fit to dwell
1164,THE GLORY,In beauty's presence. Shall I now this day
1165,THE GLORY,"Begin to seek as far as heaven, as hell,"
1166,THE GLORY,"Wisdom or strength to match this beauty, start"
1167,THE GLORY,"And tread the pale dust pitted with small dark drops,"
1168,THE GLORY,"In hope to find whatever it is I seek,"
1169,THE GLORY,Hearkening to short-lived happy-seeming things
1170,THE GLORY,"That we know naught of, in the hazel copse?"
1171,THE GLORY,Or must I be content with discontent
1172,THE GLORY,As larks and swallows are perhaps with wings?
1173,THE GLORY,And shall I ask at the day's end once more
1174,THE GLORY,"What beauty is, and what I can have meant"
1175,THE GLORY,"By happiness? And shall I let all go,"
1176,THE GLORY,"Glad, weary, or both? Or shall I perhaps know"

1206,ADLESTROP,Unwontedly. It was late June.
1207,ADLESTROP,
1208,ADLESTROP,The steam hissed. Someone cleared his throat.
1209,ADLESTROP,No one left and no one came

1330,HAYMAKING,And fir cones standing stiff up in the heat.
1331,HAYMAKING,The mill-foot water tumbled white and lit
1332,HAYMAKING,"With tossing crystals, happier than any crowd"
1333,HAYMAKING,Of children pouring out of school aloud.
1334,HAYMAKING,And in the little thickets where a sleeper
1335,HAYMAKING,"For ever might lie lost, the nettle-creeper"
1336,HAYMAKING,And garden warbler sang unceasingly;
1337,HAYMAKING,While over them shrill shrieked in his fierce glee
1338,HAYMAKING,The swift with wings and tail as sharp and narrow
1339,HAYMAKING,As if the bow had flown off with the arrow.
1340,HAYMAKING,Only the scent of woodbine and hay new-mown
1341,HAYMAKING,"Travelled the road. In the field sloping down,"
1342,HAYMAKING,"Park-like, to where its willows showed the brook,"
1343,HAYMAKING,Haymakers rested. The tosser lay forsook
1344,HAYMAKING,Out in the sun; and the long waggon stood
1345,HAYMAKING,"Without its team, it seemed it never would"
1346,HAYMAKING,Move from the shadow of that single yew.
1347,HAYMAKING,"The team, as still, until their task was due,"
1348,HAYMAKING,Beside the labourers enjoyed the shade
1349,HAYMAKING,That three squat oaks mid-field together made
1350,HAYMAKING,"Upon a circle of grass and weed uncut,"
1351,HAYMAKING,"And on the hollow, once a chalk-pit, but"
1352,HAYMAKING,Now brimmed with nut and elder-flower so clean.
1353,HAYMAKING,"The men leaned on their rakes, about to begin,"
1354,HAYMAKING,"But still. And all were silent. All was old,"
1355,HAYMAKING,"This morning time, with a great age untold,"
1356,HAYMAKING,"Older than Clare and Cobbett, Morland and Crome,"
1357,HAYMAKING,"Than, at the field's far edge, the farmer's home,"
1358,HAYMAKING,A white house crouched at the foot of a great tree.
1359,HAYMAKING,Under the heavens that know not what years be
1360,HAYMAKING,"The men, the beasts, the trees, the implements"
1361,HAYMAKING,Uttered even what they will in times far hence--
1362,HAYMAKING,All of us gone out of the reach of change--
1363,HAYMAKING,Immortal in a picture of an old grange.

1758,THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE SUN,Yet never shone the sun as fair as now
1759,THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE SUN,While the sweet last-left damsons from the bough
1760,THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE SUN,With spangles of the morning's storm drop down
1761,THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE SUN,"Because the starling shakes it, whistling what"
1762,THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE SUN,Once swallows sang. But I have not forgot
1763,THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE SUN,"That there is nothing, too, like March's sun,"
1764,THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE SUN,"Like April's, or July's, or June's, or May's,"
1765,THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE SUN,"Or January's, or February's, great days:"
1766,THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE SUN,"And August, September, October, and December"
1767,THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE SUN,"Have equal days, all different from November."
1768,THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE SUN,No day of any month but I have said--
1769,THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE SUN,"Or, if I could live long enough, should say--"
1770,THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE SUN,"""There's nothing like the sun that shines to-day"""
1771,THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE SUN,There's nothing like the sun till we are dead.
1772,THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE SUN,
1773,THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE SUN,
1774,WHEN HE SHOULD LAUGH,WHEN HE SHOULD LAUGH
1775,WHEN HE SHOULD LAUGH,
1776,WHEN HE SHOULD LAUGH,WHEN he should laugh the wise man knows full well:
1777,WHEN HE SHOULD LAUGH,For he knows what is truly laughable.
1778,WHEN HE SHOULD LAUGH,"But wiser is the man who laughs also,"
1779,WHEN HE SHOULD LAUGH,"Or holds his laughter, when the foolish do."

1784,AN OLD SONG,"THE sun set, the wind fell, the sea"
1785,AN OLD SONG,Was like a mirror shaking:
1786,AN OLD SONG,The one small wave that clapped the land
1787,AN OLD SONG,A mile-long snake of foam was making
1788,AN OLD SONG,Where tide had smoothed and wind had dried
1789,AN OLD SONG,The vacant sand.
1790,AN OLD SONG,
1791,AN OLD SONG,A light divided the swollen clouds
1792,AN OLD SONG,And lay most perfectly
1793,AN OLD SONG,Like a straight narrow footbridge bright
1794,AN OLD SONG,That crossed over the sea to me;
1795,AN OLD SONG,And no one else in the whole world
1796,AN OLD SONG,Saw that same sight.
1797,AN OLD SONG,
1798,AN OLD SONG,"I walked elate, my bridge always"
1799,AN OLD SONG,Just one step from my feet:
1800,AN OLD SONG,"A robin sang, a shade in shade:"
1801,AN OLD SONG,And all I did was to repeat:
1802,AN OLD SONG,"""I'll go no more a-roving"
1803,AN OLD SONG,"With you, fair maid."""
1804,AN OLD SONG,
1805,AN OLD SONG,The sailors' song of merry loving
1806,AN OLD SONG,With dusk and sea-gull's mewing
1807,AN OLD SONG,"Mixed sweet, the lewdness far outweighed"
1808,AN OLD SONG,By the wild charm the chorus played:
1809,AN OLD SONG,"""I'll go no more a-roving"
1810,AN OLD SONG,"With you, fair maid:"
1811,AN OLD SONG,"A-roving, a-roving, since roving's been my ruin,"
1812,AN OLD SONG,"I'll go no more a-roving with you, fair maid."""
1813,AN OLD SONG,
1814,AN OLD SONG,_In Amsterdam there dwelt a maid--
1815,AN OLD SONG,Mark well what I do say--
1816,AN OLD SONG,In Amsterdam there dwelt a maid
1817,AN OLD SONG,And she was a mistress of her trade:
1818,AN OLD SONG,I'll go no more a-roving
1819,AN OLD SONG,"With you, fair maid:"
1820,AN OLD SONG,"A-roving, a-roving, since roving's been my ruin,"

1826,THE PENNY WHISTLE,THE new moon hangs like an ivory bugle
1827,THE PENNY WHISTLE,In the naked frosty blue;

1829,THE PENNY WHISTLE,"By Winter, are blackened anew."

1834,THE PENNY WHISTLE,Betwixt rage and a moan.
1835,THE PENNY WHISTLE,
1836,THE PENNY WHISTLE,But still the caravan-hut by the hollies
1837,THE PENNY WHISTLE,Like a kingfisher gleams between:
1838,THE PENNY WHISTLE,Round the mossed old hearths of the charcoal-burners
1839,THE PENNY WHISTLE,First primroses ask to be seen.
1840,THE PENNY WHISTLE,
1841,THE PENNY WHISTLE,"The charcoal-burners are black, but their linen"
1842,THE PENNY WHISTLE,Blows white on the line;
1843,THE PENNY WHISTLE,And white the letter the girl is reading
1844,THE PENNY WHISTLE,Under that crescent fine;
1845,THE PENNY WHISTLE,
1846,THE PENNY WHISTLE,"And her brother who hides apart in a thicket,"
1847,THE PENNY WHISTLE,Slowly and surely playing
1848,THE PENNY WHISTLE,"On a whistle an olden nursery melody,"
1849,THE PENNY WHISTLE,Says far more than I am saying.
