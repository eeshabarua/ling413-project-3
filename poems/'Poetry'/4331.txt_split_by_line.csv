22,DEDICATION,
23,DEDICATION,Let me cradle myself back
24,DEDICATION,Into the darkness

26,DEDICATION,Of the cauled beginnings...
27,DEDICATION,"Let me stir the attar of unused air,"
28,DEDICATION,Elusive... ironically fragrant
29,DEDICATION,As a dead queen's kerchief...

31,DEDICATION,Resurrect your breath

33,DEDICATION,In a dead queen's hand.

103,SUN-UP,(Shadows over a cradle...
104,SUN-UP,fire-light craning....
105,SUN-UP,A hand
106,SUN-UP,throws something in the fire
107,SUN-UP,and a smaller hand
108,SUN-UP,"runs into the flame and out again,"
109,SUN-UP,singed and empty....
110,SUN-UP,Shadows
111,SUN-UP,settling over a cradle...
112,SUN-UP,two hands
113,SUN-UP,and a fire.)

117,CELIA,CELIA
118,CELIA,
119,CELIA,"Cherry, cherry,"
120,CELIA,"glowing on the hearth,"
121,CELIA,bright red cherry....
122,CELIA,When you try to pick up cherry
123,CELIA,Celia's shriek
124,CELIA,sticks in you like a pin.
125,CELIA,
126,CELIA,:  :
127,CELIA,
128,CELIA,When God throws hailstones
129,CELIA,you cuddle in Celia's shawl
130,CELIA,and press your feet on her belly
131,CELIA,high up like a stool.
132,CELIA,When Celia makes umbrella of her hand.
133,CELIA,Rain falls through
134,CELIA,big pink spokes of her fingers.
135,CELIA,When wind blows Celia's gown up off her legs
136,CELIA,she runs under pillars of the bank--
137,CELIA,great round pillars of the bank
138,CELIA,have on white stockings too.
139,CELIA,
140,CELIA,:  :
141,CELIA,
142,CELIA,Celia says my father
143,CELIA,will bring me a golden bowl.
144,CELIA,When I think of my father
145,CELIA,I cannot see him
146,CELIA,for the big yellow bowl
147,CELIA,like the moon with two handles
148,CELIA,he carries in front of him.
149,CELIA,
150,CELIA,:  :
151,CELIA,
152,CELIA,"Grandpa, grandpa..."
153,CELIA,(Light all about you...
154,CELIA,ginger... pouring out of green jars...)
155,CELIA,You don't believe he has gone away and left his great coat...
156,CELIA,so you pretend... you see his face up in the ceiling.
157,CELIA,"When you clap your hands and cry, grandpa, grandpa, grandpa,"
158,CELIA,Celia crosses herself.
159,CELIA,
160,CELIA,:  :
161,CELIA,
162,CELIA,It isn't a dream....
163,CELIA,It comes again and again....
164,CELIA,You hear ivy crying on steeples
165,CELIA,the flames haven't caught yet
166,CELIA,and images screaming
167,CELIA,when they see red light on the lilies
168,CELIA,on the stained glass window of St. Joseph.
169,CELIA,"The girl with the black eyes holds you tight,"
170,CELIA,and you run... and run
171,CELIA,"past the wild, wild towers..."
172,CELIA,and trees in the gardens tugging at their feet
173,CELIA,and little frightened dolls
174,CELIA,shut up in the shops
175,CELIA,crying... and crying... because no one stops...
176,CELIA,you spin like a penny thrown out in the street.
177,CELIA,Then the man clutches her by the hair....
178,CELIA,He always clutches her by the hair....
179,CELIA,His eyes stick out like spears.
180,CELIA,You see her pulled-back face
181,CELIA,"and her black, black eyes"
182,CELIA,lit up by the glare....
183,CELIA,Then everything goes out.
184,CELIA,"Please God, don't let me dream any more"
185,CELIA,"of the girl with the black, black eyes."
186,CELIA,
187,CELIA,:  :
188,CELIA,
189,CELIA,Celia's shadow rocks and rocks...
190,CELIA,and mama's eyes stare out of the pillow
191,CELIA,as though she had gone away
192,CELIA,and the night had come in her place
193,CELIA,as it comes in empty rooms...
194,CELIA,you can't bear it--
195,CELIA,the night threshing about
196,CELIA,and lashing its tail on its sides
197,CELIA,as bold as a wolf that isn't afraid--
198,CELIA,"and you scream at her face, that is white as a stone on a grave"
199,CELIA,"and pull it around to the light,"
200,CELIA,till the night draws backward... the night that walks alone
201,CELIA,and goes away without end.
202,CELIA,"Mama says, I am cold, Betty, and shivers."
203,CELIA,"Celia tucks the quilt about her feet,"
204,CELIA,but I run for my little red cloak
205,CELIA,because red is hot like fire.
206,CELIA,
207,CELIA,:  :
208,CELIA,
209,CELIA,I wish Celia
210,CELIA,could see the sea climb up on the sky
211,CELIA,and slide off again...
212,CELIA,...Celia saying
213,CELIA,I'd beg the world with you....
214,CELIA,Celia... holding on to the cab...
215,CELIA,hands wrenched away...
216,CELIA,wind in the masts... like Celia crying....
217,CELIA,Celia never minded if you slapped her
218,CELIA,"when the comb made your hairs ache,"
219,CELIA,but though you rub your cheek against mama's hand
220,CELIA,she has not said darling since....
221,CELIA,Now I will slap her again....
222,CELIA,I will bite her hand till it bleeds.
223,CELIA,
224,CELIA,It is cool by the port hole.
225,CELIA,The wet rags of the wind
226,CELIA,flap in your face.

230,THE ALLEY,THE ALLEY
231,THE ALLEY,
232,THE ALLEY,Because you are four years old
233,THE ALLEY,the candle is all dressed up in a new frill.
234,THE ALLEY,"And stars nod to you through the hole in the curtain,"
235,THE ALLEY,(except the big stiff planets
236,THE ALLEY,"too fat to move about much,)"
237,THE ALLEY,and you curtsey back to the stars
238,THE ALLEY,when no one is looking.
239,THE ALLEY,You feel sorry for the poor wooden chair
240,THE ALLEY,"that knows it isn't nice to sit on,"
241,THE ALLEY,and no one is sad but mama.
242,THE ALLEY,You don't like mama to be sad
243,THE ALLEY,"when you are four years old,"
244,THE ALLEY,so you pretend
245,THE ALLEY,you like the bitter gold-pale tea--
246,THE ALLEY,you pretend
247,THE ALLEY,if you don't drink it up pretty quick
248,THE ALLEY,a little gold-fish
249,THE ALLEY,will think it is a pond
250,THE ALLEY,and come and get born in it.
251,THE ALLEY,
252,THE ALLEY,:  :
253,THE ALLEY,
254,THE ALLEY,It's hot in our street
255,THE ALLEY,and the breeze is a dirty little broom
256,THE ALLEY,that sweeps dust into our room
257,THE ALLEY,and bits of paper out of the alley.
258,THE ALLEY,You are not let to play
259,THE ALLEY,with the children in the alley
260,THE ALLEY,But you must be very polite--
261,THE ALLEY,so you pass them and say good day
262,THE ALLEY,and when they fling banana skins
263,THE ALLEY,you fling them back again.
264,THE ALLEY,
265,THE ALLEY,:  :
266,THE ALLEY,
267,THE ALLEY,There is no one to play with
268,THE ALLEY,and the flies on the window
269,THE ALLEY,buzz and buzz...
270,THE ALLEY,...you can pull out their legs
271,THE ALLEY,and stick pins in their bodies
272,THE ALLEY,but still they buzz...
273,THE ALLEY,and mama says:
274,THE ALLEY,When Nero was a little boy
275,THE ALLEY,he caught flies on his mama's window
276,THE ALLEY,and pulled out their legs
277,THE ALLEY,and stuck pins in their bodies
278,THE ALLEY,and nobody loved him.
279,THE ALLEY,"Buzz, blue-bellied flies--"
280,THE ALLEY,"buzz, nasty black wheel"
281,THE ALLEY,of mama's machine--
282,THE ALLEY,you are the biggest fly of all--
283,THE ALLEY,you have the loudest buzz.
284,THE ALLEY,I hear you at dawn before the locusts.
285,THE ALLEY,But I like the picture of the Flood
286,THE ALLEY,and the little babies getting drowned....
287,THE ALLEY,"If I were there I would save them,"
288,THE ALLEY,but as I can't save them
289,THE ALLEY,I like to watch them
290,THE ALLEY,getting drowned.
291,THE ALLEY,
292,THE ALLEY,:  :
293,THE ALLEY,
294,THE ALLEY,"When mama buys of Ling Ho,"
295,THE ALLEY,he smiles very wide
296,THE ALLEY,and picks her the largest loquots.
297,THE ALLEY,The greens-man gave her a cabbage
298,THE ALLEY,and she held it against her black bodice
299,THE ALLEY,and said what a beautiful green it was
300,THE ALLEY,and put it on the table
301,THE ALLEY,as though it had been a flower.
302,THE ALLEY,But next day we boiled and ate it with salt.
303,THE ALLEY,It was our dinner.
304,THE ALLEY,
305,THE ALLEY,:  :
306,THE ALLEY,
307,THE ALLEY,Christmas day
308,THE ALLEY,I found Janie on my pillow.
309,THE ALLEY,Janie is made of rubber.
310,THE ALLEY,Her red and blue jacket won't come off.
311,THE ALLEY,Christmas dinner was green and white
312,THE ALLEY,chicken and lettuce and peas
313,THE ALLEY,and drops of oil on the salad
314,THE ALLEY,smiley and full of light
315,THE ALLEY,like the gold on the lady's teeth.
316,THE ALLEY,
317,THE ALLEY,But mama said politely
318,THE ALLEY,"Thank you, we are dining out."
319,THE ALLEY,She wouldn't let you take one pea
320,THE ALLEY,to put in the hole where the whistle was
321,THE ALLEY,"at the back of Janie's head,"
322,THE ALLEY,so Janie should have some dinner
323,THE ALLEY,So you went to the park with biscuits
324,THE ALLEY,and black tea in a bottle.
325,THE ALLEY,
326,THE ALLEY,:  :
327,THE ALLEY,
328,THE ALLEY,You feel very sad
329,THE ALLEY,when you climb on the fence
330,THE ALLEY,to watch mama out of sight.
331,THE ALLEY,The women in the alley
332,THE ALLEY,poke their heads out of doorways
333,THE ALLEY,and watch her too.
334,THE ALLEY,You know her
335,THE ALLEY,by the way she holds her shoulders
336,THE ALLEY,till she is only a speck
337,THE ALLEY,in a chain of specks--
338,THE ALLEY,till she is swallowed up.
339,THE ALLEY,But suppose
340,THE ALLEY,that day after day
341,THE ALLEY,you were to watch for her face
342,THE ALLEY,and it didn't come back?
343,THE ALLEY,Suppose
344,THE ALLEY,it were to drop out of the string of white faces
345,THE ALLEY,like the pearl out of my chain
346,THE ALLEY,I never found again?
347,THE ALLEY,
348,THE ALLEY,:  :
349,THE ALLEY,
350,THE ALLEY,"Mabel minds you while mama is out,"
351,THE ALLEY,she washes while she sings
352,THE ALLEY,Three blind mice!
353,THE ALLEY,they all run away from the farmer's wife
354,THE ALLEY,who cut off their tails
355,THE ALLEY,with a carving knife--
356,THE ALLEY,"Wind blows out Mabel's sheets,"
357,THE ALLEY,way you blow in a bag before you burst it.
358,THE ALLEY,Wind has a soapy smell.
359,THE ALLEY,It's heavier'n sun
360,THE ALLEY,that lies all over you without any weight
361,THE ALLEY,and makes you feel happy
362,THE ALLEY,and crinkly like bubbling water.
363,THE ALLEY,There's no sun on the empty house--
364,THE ALLEY,sly-looking house--
365,THE ALLEY,you can't see in its windows
366,THE ALLEY,that watch you out of their corners.
367,THE ALLEY,Perhaps there's a big spider there
368,THE ALLEY,spinning gray threads over the windows
369,THE ALLEY,till they look like dead people's faces....
370,THE ALLEY,Jimmie says:
371,THE ALLEY,Jimmie's hair is white as a white mouse.
372,THE ALLEY,His lashes are gold as mama's wedding ring
373,THE ALLEY,and his mouth feels cool and smooth
374,THE ALLEY,like a flower wet with rain.
375,THE ALLEY,You wouldn't believe Jimmie was different...
376,THE ALLEY,till he showed you....
377,THE ALLEY,
378,THE ALLEY,:  :
379,THE ALLEY,
380,THE ALLEY,Blind wet sheets
381,THE ALLEY,flapping on the lines...
382,THE ALLEY,"sun in your eyes,"
383,THE ALLEY,dark gold sun
384,THE ALLEY,"full of little black spots,"
385,THE ALLEY,you have to blink and blink...
386,THE ALLEY,round eyes of Jimmie....
387,THE ALLEY,Jimmie's blue jumper...
388,THE ALLEY,blue shadow of wall...
389,THE ALLEY,all the world holding still
390,THE ALLEY,as when a clock stops...
391,THE ALLEY,streets still... people still...
392,THE ALLEY,no streets... no people...
393,THE ALLEY,only sky and wall...
394,THE ALLEY,sun glaring bright as God
395,THE ALLEY,down at you and Jimmie...
396,THE ALLEY,shadow like a purple cloth
397,THE ALLEY,trailing off the wall...
398,THE ALLEY,
399,THE ALLEY,Wild wet sheets
400,THE ALLEY,flapping in the wind...
401,THE ALLEY,big slippered feet flapping too...
402,THE ALLEY,big-balloon-face
403,THE ALLEY,rushing up the alley...
404,THE ALLEY,houses closing up again...
405,THE ALLEY,windows looking round...
406,THE ALLEY,... Mabel pulls you in the gate and shakes you
407,THE ALLEY,and tells you not to tell your mama...
408,THE ALLEY,And you wonder
409,THE ALLEY,if God has spoiled Jimmie.

413,MAMA,MAMA
414,MAMA,
415,MAMA,Mama's face
416,MAMA,is smooth and pale as tea-rose leaves.
417,MAMA,That ivory oval of aunt Gem
418,MAMA,you sucked the miniature off
419,MAMA,had black black hair like mama.
420,MAMA,
421,MAMA,:  :
422,MAMA,
423,MAMA,"Pit-it-ty-pat,"
424,MAMA,"Mama walks so fast,"
425,MAMA,street lamps jig
426,MAMA,without bending a leg...
427,MAMA,lights in the windows
428,MAMA,play twinkling tunes
429,MAMA,on crimson and blue
430,MAMA,bottles like bubbles
431,MAMA,big as balloons...
432,MAMA,Faster and faster...
433,MAMA,and pink light spurts
434,MAMA,over cakes doing polkas
435,MAMA,"in little white shirts,"
436,MAMA,with cake-princesses
437,MAMA,in flounced white skirts.
438,MAMA,
439,MAMA,Pit-pat--
440,MAMA,mama walks slower...
441,MAMA,slower and... slower...
442,MAMA,Eyes... lamps... stars...
443,MAMA,acres and acres of stars...
444,MAMA,bells... and sleepily
445,MAMA,flapping feet....
446,MAMA,You're glad mama walks slow.
447,MAMA,It's nice to be carried along
448,MAMA,up high near the stars
449,MAMA,"that look at you with a grave, great look."
450,MAMA,
451,MAMA,:  :
452,MAMA,
453,MAMA,Every night
454,MAMA,mama sings you to sleep.
455,MAMA,"When she sings, O for the light of thine eyes Dolores,"
456,MAMA,there's a castle on a cliff
457,MAMA,and the sea roars like lions.
458,MAMA,It leaps at the castle
459,MAMA,and the cliff knocks it down
460,MAMA,but always the sea
461,MAMA,shakes its flattened head
462,MAMA,and gets up again.
463,MAMA,The castle has no roof
464,MAMA,"so the rain spins silvery webs in it,"
465,MAMA,and Dolores' face
466,MAMA,floats dim and beautiful
467,MAMA,the way flowers do when they are drowned.
468,MAMA,Step by white step
469,MAMA,"she goes up the castle stairs,"
470,MAMA,but the stair goes up into the sky
471,MAMA,"and the sky keeps going up too,"
472,MAMA,and none of them ever get there.
473,MAMA,
474,MAMA,"When mama sings Ba ba black sheep,"
475,MAMA,the stars seem to shine through her voice
476,MAMA,"so everything has to be still,"
477,MAMA,and when she has finished singing
478,MAMA,"her song goes up off the earth,"
479,MAMA,higher and higher...
480,MAMA,till it is only as big as a tiny silver bird
481,MAMA,with nothing but moonlight around it.
482,MAMA,

485,BETTY,BETTY
486,BETTY,
487,BETTY,You can see the sandhills from our new room.
488,BETTY,Butterflies
489,BETTY,live in the sandhills
490,BETTY,and lizards
491,BETTY,and centipedes.
492,BETTY,If you keep very still
493,BETTY,lizards will think you a stone
494,BETTY,and run over your lap.
495,BETTY,Butterflies' liveries
496,BETTY,are scarlet and black.
497,BETTY,They drive chariots in air.
498,BETTY,People in the chariots
499,BETTY,are pale as dew--
500,BETTY,you can see right through them--
501,BETTY,but the chariots
502,BETTY,are made of gold of the sun.
503,BETTY,They go up to heaven
504,BETTY,and never catch fire.
505,BETTY,There are green centipedes
506,BETTY,and brown centipedes
507,BETTY,"and black centipedes,"
508,BETTY,because green and brown and black
509,BETTY,are the colors in hell's flag.
510,BETTY,Centipedes
511,BETTY,have hundreds of feet
512,BETTY,because it is so far from hell
513,BETTY,to come up for air.
514,BETTY,Centipedes
515,BETTY,do not hurry.
516,BETTY,They are waiting for the last day
517,BETTY,when they will creep over the false prophets
518,BETTY,who will have their hands tied.
519,BETTY,
520,BETTY,:  :
521,BETTY,
522,BETTY,Night calls to the sandhills
523,BETTY,and gathers them under her.
524,BETTY,she pushes away cities
525,BETTY,because their sharp lights
526,BETTY,hurt her soft breast.
527,BETTY,Even candles make a sore place
528,BETTY,when they stick in the night.
529,BETTY,
530,BETTY,There are things in the sandhills
531,BETTY,that no one knows about...
532,BETTY,they come out at dark when the young snakes play
533,BETTY,and tell each other secrets
534,BETTY,in the deaf logs.
535,BETTY,
536,BETTY,Sometimes... before rain...
537,BETTY,when the stars have gone inside...
538,BETTY,the night comes close to your window
539,BETTY,and sniffs at the light....
540,BETTY,But you must not run away--
541,BETTY,you must keep your face to the night
542,BETTY,and walk backward.

545,BETTY,
546,BETTY,When it rains
547,BETTY,and you are pulling off flies' legs...
548,BETTY,mama lets you play houses
549,BETTY,with Lizzie and Clara.
550,BETTY,Because you are the Only One--
551,BETTY,and because Only Ones have to live alone
552,BETTY,"while sisters stay together,"
553,BETTY,Lizzie and Clara
554,BETTY,give you the dry house
555,BETTY,and take the one with the leaking roof.
556,BETTY,
557,BETTY,Rain like curly hairpins
558,BETTY,blows on Lizzie and Clara's two heads
559,BETTY,turned like one head--
560,BETTY,two mouths
561,BETTY,spread into one laugh.
562,BETTY,Lizzie is saying:
563,BETTY,why don't you want to play--
564,BETTY,when you feel you'd like to braid
565,BETTY,the crinkled-silver rain
566,BETTY,into a shining rope
567,BETTY,to climb up... and up... and up... into the wet sky
568,BETTY,and never see any one again.
569,BETTY,
570,BETTY,Our gate doesn't hang right.
571,BETTY,It must have pawed at the wind
572,BETTY,and gotten a kick
573,BETTY,as the wind passed over.
574,BETTY,The sitting sky
575,BETTY,puffs out a gray smoke
576,BETTY,and the wind makes a red-striped sound
577,BETTY,"blowing out straight,"
578,BETTY,but our gate drags its foot
579,BETTY,and whines to itself on one hinge.

582,BETTY,
583,BETTY,What do you think I've found--
584,BETTY,"two wee knickers of fairy brass,"
585,BETTY,or two gold sovereigns folded up
586,BETTY,"in a bit of green silk,"
587,BETTY,or two gold bugs
588,BETTY,in little green shirts?
589,BETTY,"If you want to know,"
590,BETTY,you must walk tip-toe
591,BETTY,so your feet just whisper in the grass--
592,BETTY,you must carry them careful
593,BETTY,"and very proud,"
594,BETTY,for their stems bleed drops of milk--
595,BETTY,but Lizzie and Clara shout in glee:
596,BETTY,"Pee-a-bed, pee-a-bed--"
597,BETTY,dandelions!
598,BETTY,You look in the eyes of grown-up people
599,BETTY,to see if they feel
600,BETTY,the way you feel...
601,BETTY,"but they hide inside of themselves,"
602,BETTY,and so you do not find out.
603,BETTY,Grown-up people say:
604,BETTY,"The stars are bright to-night,"
605,BETTY,but they do not say
606,BETTY,what you are thinking about stars--
607,BETTY,not even mama says what you are thinking about stars.
608,BETTY,This makes you feel very lonely.

610,BETTY,:  :
611,BETTY,
612,BETTY,It's strange about stars....
613,BETTY,You have to be still when they look at you.
614,BETTY,They push your song inside of you with their song.
615,BETTY,Their long silvery rays
616,BETTY,sink into you and do not hurt.
617,BETTY,It is good to feel them resting on you
618,BETTY,like great white birds...
619,BETTY,and their shining whiteness
620,BETTY,doesn't burn like the sun--
621,BETTY,it washes all over you

629,BETTY,but I always kiss her afterwards.
630,BETTY,When I have kissed all the paint off her body
631,BETTY,I shall tie a ribbon about it
632,BETTY,so she shan't look shabby.
633,BETTY,But it must be blue--
634,BETTY,it mustn't be pink--
635,BETTY,pink shows the dirt on her face

639,BETTY,
640,BETTY,I beat Janie
641,BETTY,and beat her...

643,BETTY,so I scratched her between the eyes with a pin.
644,BETTY,Now she doesn't love me anymore...
645,BETTY,she scowls... and scowls...
646,BETTY,though I've begged her to forgive me
647,BETTY,and poured sugar in the hole at the back of her head.

651,BETTY,Mama says Janie is a fairy doll
652,BETTY,and she has forgiven me--
653,BETTY,that she's gone to the market
654,BETTY,to buy me some sweets.
655,BETTY,--Now she's at the door
656,BETTY,and a little bag tied to her neck--
657,BETTY,I run to Janie
658,BETTY,and kiss her all over....
659,BETTY,Ah... she is still frowning.
660,BETTY,I let the sweets drop on the floor--

672,BETTY,But why aren't you happy
673,BETTY,if it's a new day?
674,BETTY,Because something has happened...
675,BETTY,something sad and terrible....
676,BETTY,Now I remember... it's Janie.
677,BETTY,Yesterday
678,BETTY,I took Janie out
679,BETTY,and tied my handkerchief over her face
680,BETTY,and put sand in it
681,BETTY,and threw her into the ditch
682,BETTY,down in the black water
683,BETTY,under the dock leaves...
684,BETTY,and when mama asked me where Janie was
685,BETTY,I said I had lost her.

691,BETTY,and forget all about it....
692,BETTY,But mama looks at my tongue
693,BETTY,and says she will give me senna tea.
694,BETTY,When you smell the tea
695,BETTY,you shut your eyes tight
696,BETTY,and pretend not to hear
697,BETTY,"the soft, cool voice of mama"
698,BETTY,that goes over your forehead
699,BETTY,like a little wind.
700,BETTY,And then you lie in the dark
701,BETTY,and stare... and stare...
702,BETTY,till the faces come...
703,BETTY,yellow faces with leering eyes
704,BETTY,drifting in a greeny mist....
705,BETTY,I wonder
706,BETTY,if Janie sees faces
707,BETTY,out there... alone in the dark....

709,BETTY,if she has got the handkerchief off
710,BETTY,or if the water has gone in the hole
711,BETTY,where the whistle was
712,BETTY,at the back of her head
713,BETTY,and drowned her...

722,BETTY,doesn't even flick off the flies.
723,BETTY,And you can hear the silence
724,BETTY,"buzzing in the gum trees,"
725,BETTY,the way the angels buzzed
726,BETTY,when they flew through the cedars of Lebanon
727,BETTY,with thin gauze wings
728,BETTY,you could see through.
729,BETTY,Nice to hear the silence buzzing--
730,BETTY,till it comes too close
731,BETTY,and booms in your ears
732,BETTY,and presses all over you
733,BETTY,till you scream....
734,BETTY,When you scream at the silence
735,BETTY,it goes to jingling pieces
736,BETTY,like a silver mirror
737,BETTY,broken into tiny bits.
738,BETTY,Perhaps its wings are made of glass--
739,BETTY,"perhaps it lives down in a dark, dark cave"
740,BETTY,and only comes up
741,BETTY,to warm its wings in the sun....

1054,JUDE,But the clock keeps saying:
1055,JUDE,"Dirty little beggar,"
1056,JUDE,dirty little beggar....
1057,JUDE,Some day
1058,JUDE,I will get that boy.
1059,JUDE,I will pull off his arms and legs
1060,JUDE,and put him in a box
1061,JUDE,and hide the box
1062,JUDE,under the bed....
1063,JUDE,I wonder
1064,JUDE,will he buzz
1065,JUDE,when I take him out to look at his body
1066,JUDE,that will have no arms to whip me?
1067,JUDE,
1068,JUDE,Mama drew my cot to the window
1069,JUDE,so I can look at the stars.
1070,JUDE,I will not look at the stars.
1071,JUDE,There is a black chimney
1072,JUDE,throwing up sparks
1073,JUDE,and one tall flame
1074,JUDE,like gold hair in a blaze....
1075,JUDE,I know now
1076,JUDE,what I shall do....
1077,JUDE,I will set fire to him
1078,JUDE,and he will burn up into a tall flame--
1079,JUDE,he will scream into the sky
1080,JUDE,and sparks will fly out of him--
1081,JUDE,he will burn and burn...
1082,JUDE,and his blazing hair
1083,JUDE,shall light up the world.

1085,JUDE,:  :
1086,JUDE,
1087,JUDE,Before he hit me--
1088,JUDE,I knew he was going to--
1089,JUDE,I thought about Jude....
1090,JUDE,I thought if he'd fight...
1091,JUDE,but he shriveled all up...
1092,JUDE,he lay down like a fear.
1093,JUDE,
1094,JUDE,Mama never knew about Jude.
1095,JUDE,"You always wanted to tell her,"
1096,JUDE,but somehow you never did.
1097,JUDE,You were afraid she'd smile
1098,JUDE,and say he wasn't real--
1099,JUDE,"that he was only a little dream-boy,"
1100,JUDE,because the grass didn't fall down under his feet....
1101,JUDE,He is fading now....
1102,JUDE,He is just lines... like a drawing....
1103,JUDE,You can see mama in between.
1104,JUDE,When she moves
1105,JUDE,she rubs some of him out.

1585,I,
1586,I,"We are old,"
1587,I,Old as song.
1588,I,Before Rome was
1589,I,Or Cyrene.
1590,I,Mad nights knew us
1591,I,And old men's wives.
1592,I,We knew who spilled the sacred oil
1593,I,For young-gold harlots of the town....
1594,I,We knew where the peacocks went
1595,I,And the white doe for sacrifice.
1596,I,
1597,II,II
1598,II,
1599,II,We were the Sons of Belial.
1600,II,One black night
1601,II,Centuries ago
1602,II,We beat at a door
1603,II,In Gilead....
1604,II,We took the Levite's concubine
1605,II,We plucked her hands from off the door....
1606,II,We choked the cry into her throat
1607,II,And stuck the stars among her hair....
1608,II,We glimpsed the madly swaying stars
1609,II,Between the rhythms of her hair
1610,II,And all our mute and separate strings
1611,II,Swelled in a raging symphony....
1612,II,Our blood sang paeans
1613,II,All that night
1614,II,Till dawn fell like a wounded swan
1615,II,Upon the fields of Gilead.
1616,II,
1617,III,III
1618,III,
1619,III,We are old....
1620,III,Old as song....
1621,III,We are dumb song.
1622,III,(Epics tingled
1623,III,In our blood
1624,III,When we haled Hypatia
1625,III,Over the stones
1626,III,In Alexandria.)
1627,III,
1628,III,Could we loose
1629,III,The wild rhythms clinched in us....
1630,III,March in bands of troubadours....
1631,III,We would be of gentle mood.
1632,III,When Christ healed us
1633,III,Who were dumb--
1634,III,When he freed our shut-in song--
1635,III,We strewed green palms
1636,III,At his pale feet...
1637,III,We sang hosannas
1638,III,In Jerusalem.
1639,III,And all our fumbling voices blent
1640,III,In a brief white harmony.
1641,III,(But a mightier song
1642,III,Was in us pent
1643,III,When we nailed Christ
1644,III,To a four-armed tree.)

1651,IV,Gutters of Berlin
1652,IV,Where we stamped Rosa... Luxemburg
1653,IV,On a night in spring.)
1654,IV,Rhythms skurry in our blood.
1655,IV,Little nimble rats of song
1656,IV,In our feet run crazily
1657,IV,And all is dust... we trample... on.
1658,IV,
1659,IV,Mad nights when we make ritual
1660,IV,(Feet running before the sleuth-light...
1661,IV,And the smell of burnt flesh
1662,IV,By a flame-ringed hut
1663,IV,"In Missouri,"
1664,IV,Sweet as on Rome's pyre....)
1665,IV,We make ropes do rigadoons
1666,IV,With copper feet that jig on air....
1667,IV,We are the Mob....
1668,IV,Old as song.
1669,IV,Tyre knew us
1670,IV,And Israel.

1685,I,Hovering... disappearing... recurring...
1686,I,the foreman's head.
1687,I,
1688,I,Droning of power-machines...
1689,I,droning of girl with adenoids...
1690,I,Arms flapping with a fin-like motion
1691,I,under sun burning down through a sky-light like a glass lid.
1692,I,Light skating on the rims of wheels...
1693,I,boring in gimlet points.
1694,I,Needles flickering
1695,I,fierce white threads of light
1696,I,fine as a wasp's sting.
1697,I,Light in sweat-drops brighter than eyes
1698,I,and calico-pallid faces
1699,I,and bodies throwing off smells--
1700,I,and the air a bloated presence pressing on the walls
1701,I,and the silence a compressed scream.
1702,I,
1703,I,Allons enfants de la patrie--
1704,I,Electric... piercing... shrill as a fife
1705,I,the voice of a little Russian
1706,I,breaks out of the shivered circle.
1707,I,Another voice rises... another and another
1708,I,leaps like flame to flame.
1709,I,"And life--surging, clamorous, swarming like a rabble"
1710,I,crazily fluttering ragged petticoats--
1711,I,comes rushing back into torpid eyes
1712,I,like suddenly yielded gates.
1713,I,
1714,I,The girl with adenoids
1715,I,rocks on her hams.
1716,I,A torrent of song
1717,I,"strains at her throat,"
1718,I,"gurgles, rushes, gouges her blocked pipes."
1719,I,Her feet beat a wild tattoo--
1720,I,head flung back and pelvis lifting
1721,I,to the white body of the sun.
1722,I,"Mates now, these two--"
1723,I,goddess and god....
1724,I,Marchons!
1725,I,
1726,I,Only the power machines drone
1727,I,with metallic docility
1728,I,under the flaxen head of the foreman

1737,II,without any beards
1738,II,drive to a feast of buttered squabs.
1739,II,The band... accoutered and neatly caparisoned...
1740,II,plays the Marseillaise....
1741,II,And I think of a wild stallion... newly caught...
1742,II,flanks yet taut and nostrils spread
1743,II,"to the smell of a racing mare,"
1744,II,hitched to a grocer's cart.

1751,REVEILLE,Let the iron run wild
1752,REVEILLE,Like a red bramble on the floors--
1753,REVEILLE,Leave the mill and the foundry and the mine
1754,REVEILLE,And the shrapnel lying on the wharves--

1756,REVEILLE,"Come,"
1757,REVEILLE,"With your ashen lives,"
1758,REVEILLE,Your lives like dust in your hands.
1759,REVEILLE,
1760,REVEILLE,"I call upon you, workers."
1761,REVEILLE,It is not yet light
1762,REVEILLE,But I beat upon your doors.
1763,REVEILLE,You say you await the Dawn
1764,REVEILLE,But I say you are the Dawn.
1765,REVEILLE,"Come, in your irresistible unspent force"
1766,REVEILLE,And make new light upon the mountains.
1767,REVEILLE,
1768,REVEILLE,You have turned deaf ears to others--
1769,REVEILLE,Me you shall hear.
1770,REVEILLE,"Out of the mouths of turbines,"
1771,REVEILLE,"Out of the turgid throats of engines,"
1772,REVEILLE,"Over the whistling steam,"
1773,REVEILLE,You shall hear me shrilly piping.
1774,REVEILLE,"Your mills I shall enter like the wind,"
1775,REVEILLE,"And blow upon your hearts,"
1776,REVEILLE,Kindling the slow fire.
1777,REVEILLE,
1778,REVEILLE,"They think they have tamed you, workers--"
1779,REVEILLE,Beaten you to a tool
1780,REVEILLE,To scoop up hot honor
1781,REVEILLE,Till it be cool--
1782,REVEILLE,But out of the passion of the red frontiers
1783,REVEILLE,A great flower trembles and burns and glows
1784,REVEILLE,And each of its petals is a people.
1785,REVEILLE,
1786,REVEILLE,"Come forth, you workers--"
1787,REVEILLE,Clinging to your stable
1788,REVEILLE,And your wisp of warm straw--
1789,REVEILLE,"Let the fires grow cold,"
1790,REVEILLE,"Let the iron spill out of the troughs,"
1791,REVEILLE,Let the iron run wild
1792,REVEILLE,Like a red bramble on the floors....
1793,REVEILLE,
1794,REVEILLE,As our forefathers stood on the prairies
1795,REVEILLE,"So let us stand in a ring,"
1796,REVEILLE,Let us tear up their prisons like grass
1797,REVEILLE,And beat them to barricades--
1798,REVEILLE,Let us meet the fire of their guns
1799,REVEILLE,"With a greater fire,"
1800,REVEILLE,Till the birds shall fly to the mountains
1801,REVEILLE,For one safe bough.

1806,TO ALEXANDER BERKMAN,I can see you....
1807,TO ALEXANDER BERKMAN,A tentacle of the vast dawn is resting on your face
1808,TO ALEXANDER BERKMAN,that floats as though detached

1836,TO ALEXANDER BERKMAN,until the day... that has soiled herself in this black hole
1837,TO ALEXANDER BERKMAN,to caress the pale mask of your face...
1838,TO ALEXANDER BERKMAN,withdraws the last wizened ray
1839,TO ALEXANDER BERKMAN,to wash in the infinite
1840,TO ALEXANDER BERKMAN,her discolored hands.
