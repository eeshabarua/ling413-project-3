100,SEA SPRAY,What shall we do with our day? you ask--
101,SEA SPRAY,A June day fair to the heart's desire--
102,SEA SPRAY,"Lie in the meadow, and lounge and bask"
103,SEA SPRAY,Over books and tobacco? Or do you aspire
104,SEA SPRAY,To conquer the summit that yesterday
105,SEA SPRAY,We marked for our own ere your visit end?
106,SEA SPRAY,"Or shall we go riding, or fishing? Nay,"
107,SEA SPRAY,"For the scent of the sea's on the air, my friend."
108,SEA SPRAY,"We shall go to the head of the reedy lake,"
109,SEA SPRAY,"And there, in a brake by a fir-grove, find"
110,SEA SPRAY,"Two long canoes with arching deck,"
111,SEA SPRAY,"Sea-riders, strong for a day of wind;"
112,SEA SPRAY,"And oh, what a song shall the bright wind sing us"
113,SEA SPRAY,"When clear of the shallows and clear of the sedge,"
114,SEA SPRAY,While the narrowing stream and the ebb-tide swing us
115,SEA SPRAY,'Twixt sea and mountain to Wicklow Bridge!
116,SEA SPRAY,
117,SEA SPRAY,But here beware! for the ebb goes roaring
118,SEA SPRAY,"Through half the arches, and half are dry,"
119,SEA SPRAY,And stakes and stones are ready for goring
120,SEA SPRAY,Your Rob-Roy's timbers as down you fly.
121,SEA SPRAY,"And beyond the Bridge, in the deep sea-current,"
122,SEA SPRAY,"Where the rope-maze crosses from quay to quay,"
123,SEA SPRAY,"You'll need your head and your arm I warrant,"
124,SEA SPRAY,To fight the eddies and find your way.
125,SEA SPRAY,There lifts your prow with the long pulsation
126,SEA SPRAY,That tells how near us the glad seas are!
127,SEA SPRAY,"There lifts the heart with the old elation,"
128,SEA SPRAY,To meet the surf at the harbour-bar!
129,SEA SPRAY,
130,SEA SPRAY,"The North wind marshals the ranks of ocean,"
131,SEA SPRAY,"And on they sweep with a strength serene,"
132,SEA SPRAY,Till the tide-race ruffles the mighty motion
133,SEA SPRAY,And curls the crests of the rollers green.
134,SEA SPRAY,"The breakers flash on the sand-bank yonder,"
135,SEA SPRAY,And the cavern'd curve of the rock-walled bay
136,SEA SPRAY,Is loud with clamour of hoarse sea-thunder
137,SEA SPRAY,As the wave recoils in a blast of spray.
138,SEA SPRAY,
139,SEA SPRAY,"And I know a cleft among grim rock-masses,"
140,SEA SPRAY,"Where if wind blow strong and the light come fair,"
141,SEA SPRAY,"When the sea-cave roars and the spray-jet flashes,"
142,SEA SPRAY,A rainbow floats in the sunny air.
143,SEA SPRAY,
144,SEA SPRAY,"At the Head's wild verge, where the tideways quicken,"
145,SEA SPRAY,"And eddies hollow the smooth sea-caves,"
146,SEA SPRAY,"Our Rob-Roys plunge as the breakers thicken,"
147,SEA SPRAY,And bury their decks in the rearing waves.
148,SEA SPRAY,We round the Point in the surge and welter
149,SEA SPRAY,Of clashing billows and blinding foam--
150,SEA SPRAY,"Then mile on mile, in the cliff-wall's shelter,"
151,SEA SPRAY,In calm new seas to the South we roam.
152,SEA SPRAY,
153,SEA SPRAY,"O bays of Wicklow, and gorse-crown'd headlands"
154,SEA SPRAY,"Whose scent blows far on the seaward breeze,"
155,SEA SPRAY,How oft have I yearned in the tranquil midlands
156,SEA SPRAY,For one brave shock of your lifting seas!
157,SEA SPRAY,How oft it may be in days hereafter
158,SEA SPRAY,"Shall rise the thought of you, phantom-fair,"
159,SEA SPRAY,Shall steal the sound of the sea-waves' laughter
160,SEA SPRAY,On ears grown dull with time and care!
161,SEA SPRAY,"Waves, wash my spirit, and lonely places,"
162,SEA SPRAY,"If well I loved you, and aught you knew,"
163,SEA SPRAY,Mark deep my heart with immortal traces
164,SEA SPRAY,Of shining days when I dwelt with you!

173,MARCH WINDS,How at the shock of thy might wakens within me a cry!
174,MARCH WINDS,"Out of what wonderful lands, never trodden by man, never told of,"
175,MARCH WINDS,"Lands where never a ship anchored or trafficker fared,"
176,MARCH WINDS,"Comest thou, breathing like flame till the brown earth flames into"
177,MARCH WINDS,"blossom,"
178,MARCH WINDS,"Quick'ning the sap of old woods swayed in thy stormy embrace,"
179,MARCH WINDS,"Rousing in depths of the heart wild waves of an infinite longing,"
180,MARCH WINDS,"Longing for freedom and life, yearning for Springs that are dead!"
181,MARCH WINDS,"Surely the far blue sea, foam-fleck'd with the speed of thy coming"
182,MARCH WINDS,"Brighten'd in laughter abroad, sang at the feet of the isles,"
183,MARCH WINDS,"Sang in a tumult of joy as my soul sings trembling with passion,"
184,MARCH WINDS,"Trembling with passion and hope, wild with the spirit of Spring."
185,MARCH WINDS,"Ah, what dreams re-arise, half pain half bliss to remember,"
186,MARCH WINDS,Hearing the storm of thy song blown from the height of the skies:--
187,MARCH WINDS,"_Something remains upon earth to be done, to be dared, to be sought"
188,MARCH WINDS,"for,"
189,MARCH WINDS,Up with the anchor once more--out with the sails to the blast!
190,MARCH WINDS,"Out to the shock of the seas that encircle the Fortunate Islands,"
191,MARCH WINDS,"Vision that burns in the blood, home of the Wind of the Spring._"

240,THE SPELL-STRUCK,"Some mystic dance to tread,"
241,THE SPELL-STRUCK,"So falls her gliding footstep,"
242,THE SPELL-STRUCK,So leans her list'ning head;

248,THE SPELL-STRUCK,"Her eyes are bright and tearless,"

254,THE SPELL-STRUCK,The golden fairy music
255,THE SPELL-STRUCK,That filled the lonely rath!
256,THE SPELL-STRUCK,
257,THE SPELL-STRUCK,Her lips have felt strange kisses
258,THE SPELL-STRUCK,"And drunk the wine of death,"
259,THE SPELL-STRUCK,Nor earthly love nor laughter
260,THE SPELL-STRUCK,Shall stir their tender breath.
261,THE SPELL-STRUCK,She's dead to all things living
262,THE SPELL-STRUCK,"Since that November Eve,"

510,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,
511,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,We've cleared the station--free at last
512,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"From darkness, din, and worry;"
513,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"By red-brick villas, shady roads"
514,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,And garden-plots we hurry.
515,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,And now green miles of pasture-land
516,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"Flit by, with budding hedges,"
517,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,And far to Southward I can see
518,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,The purple mountain ridges.
519,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,
520,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"My fellow-travellers pretermit,"
521,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"Seeing there is no danger,"
522,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,That anxious glance with which we greet
523,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,The presence of a stranger.
524,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"Whom have we? First, some man of means"
525,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"(I guess), brow-wrinkled, dull-eyed,"
526,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,His face the index of a soul
527,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,By cares unworthy sullied.
528,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,
529,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"And then a lady, whom I deem"
530,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,Some mask of Fashion merely;
531,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"And last, a maid of nineteen years,"
532,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"Who, since I've seen her clearly,"
533,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,Has won the careless glance I gave
534,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"To linger, as delighted"
535,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,As with some green-rimmed waterspring
536,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,In midst of deserts blighted.
537,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,
538,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"What is her charm? Not very fair,"
539,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,Nor luring to the senses--
540,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"And yet her frank and girlish grace,"
541,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"Her lack of small pretences,"
542,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"Her clear, unconscious hazel eyes,"
543,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"Pure lips, and simple neatness,"
544,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,Fill my heart as I gaze on her
545,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,With deep and tender sweetness.

551,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"Will soon begin to snore, perhaps;"
552,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,Kind Morpheus touch'd him as he scanned
553,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,The last returns of traffic--
554,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,The lady clad in furs and silks
555,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,Is trifling with her _Graphic_.
556,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,
557,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,The maiden looks with dreaming eyes
558,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,As wood and field and river
559,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,Flash past our roaring carriage-wheels
560,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,In whirling dance forever.
561,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,What are the thoughts that smooth her brows
562,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"To such content, I wonder,"
563,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,While clangs about our silent group
564,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,The railroad's rhythmic thunder?
565,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,
566,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,But now more slow the landscape moves--
567,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,We reach a little station--
568,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"And how the maiden's face has changed,"
569,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,Lit up with expectation!
570,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"A brother, with his sister's eyes,"
571,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"Brown-cheeked from sun and heather,"
572,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,Awaits her; and with half a sigh
573,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,I watch them leave together.
574,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,
575,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"The heavy train regathers speed,"
576,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,And minute after minute
577,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,The country station drops behind--
578,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,Some spell is surely in it!
579,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,For now my fellow-travellers seem
580,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,No mark for peevish scorning--
581,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,Those withered lives had surely once
582,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,The innocence of morning.
583,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,
584,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"But ah, the world's use, soon or late,"
585,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"Dispels the early glamour,"
586,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,And faint the spheral music rings
587,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,In this incessant clamour!
588,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"Save when, at times, in some strange lull"
589,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"Of tyrannous self-seeking,"
590,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,The heart of memory is thrilled
591,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,By ancient voices speaking.
592,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,
593,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,And then the cloud in which we walk
594,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"Rolls by us, and from dreaming"
595,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,We wake to see the primal world
596,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,In beauty round us gleaming;
597,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,Then common things to common eyes
598,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,"Their secret life surrender,"
599,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,And glow beneath the light of day
600,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,With visionary splendour.

608,A RAILWAY JOURNEY,That glory flashed upon a soul

943,MESSENGER,"Some God that hated Persia. First, there came"

945,MESSENGER,"""Keep watch,"" he said, ""for at the dead of night"
946,MESSENGER,"Our benches shall be manned, our fleet dispersed;"
947,MESSENGER,"They will escape you in the narrow seas."""
948,MESSENGER,"This Xerxes heard, O Queen, and never saw"
949,MESSENGER,"The Greek man's guile, nor knew the Gods his foe."
950,MESSENGER,To all the captains of the fleet he sent
951,MESSENGER,"This order: ""When the sun his fiery beams"
952,MESSENGER,"Hath hidden from the earth, and night holds all"
953,MESSENGER,"The empire of the air, then set your ships,"
954,MESSENGER,Some ranged in threefold line to guard the friths
955,MESSENGER,"And close up all the roaring waterways,"
956,MESSENGER,Some to patrol the Isle of Salamis.
957,MESSENGER,"And mark ye, should the Greeks escape their doom"
958,MESSENGER,"By one unguarded outlet, 'tis decreed"
959,MESSENGER,"Your heads shall fall for it."" So spake the King,"
960,MESSENGER,"Haughty, infatuate, knowing not the end."
961,MESSENGER,And dutifully they obeyed his word.
962,MESSENGER,Supper was first prepared; each oarsman then
963,MESSENGER,Looked to his tholepin and bound fast the oar.
964,MESSENGER,"Then, as the sunlight faded from the earth,"
965,MESSENGER,"And night came on, the rowers went on board,"
966,MESSENGER,And with them every well-trained fighting man;
967,MESSENGER,And soon from squadron unto squadron rolled
968,MESSENGER,"Down the vast lines the cheering of the fleet,"
969,MESSENGER,As each one rowed to his appointed place.
970,MESSENGER,So all night long the captains made us cruise
971,MESSENGER,"Hither and thither, every ship we had;"
972,MESSENGER,"And now the night was spent, yet never once"
973,MESSENGER,The Greeks had tried our watch in secret flight.
974,MESSENGER,But when the white steeds of the God of Day
975,MESSENGER,"Mounted the sky, and light possessed the land,"
976,MESSENGER,"Then from the Greeks a mighty chant was borne,"
977,MESSENGER,"Triumphant, to our ears, and every cliff"
978,MESSENGER,Of sea-girt Salamis pealed back the strain.
979,MESSENGER,"And fear possessed us every one, O Queen,"
980,MESSENGER,And staggering doubt; for not as if in flight
981,MESSENGER,"Rose the great pæan then among the Greeks,"
982,MESSENGER,But as when brave men cheer themselves for fight.
983,MESSENGER,"Then the heart-kindling trumpet spake, and then"
984,MESSENGER,We heard the thunder of a thousand oars
985,MESSENGER,"That swung together at the steersman's cry,"
986,MESSENGER,And all at once the sounding furrows smote.
987,MESSENGER,"Then soon full clear their charging line we saw,"
988,MESSENGER,"The right wing leading, and the main array"
989,MESSENGER,A little after; and ere long we heard
990,MESSENGER,"Such cries as these: ""On, children of the Greek!"
991,MESSENGER,"Now for your fatherland, for freedom now!"
992,MESSENGER,"For wife and child, and for your fathers' homes!"
993,MESSENGER,Now for the temples of your fathers' Gods!
994,MESSENGER,"To-day we fight for all!"" So cried they still,"
995,MESSENGER,"Nor were we Persians dumb, but sent them back"
996,MESSENGER,Shouting for shouting. Little time there was
997,MESSENGER,"To range our lines, until the brazen beaks"
998,MESSENGER,"Crash'd in among us. First, a ship of Greece,"
999,MESSENGER,"Leading the onset, rent off all the prow"
1000,MESSENGER,From a Phoenician. Each then sought a foe;
1001,MESSENGER,"And first we stemm'd the torrent of their charge,"
1002,MESSENGER,But soon our multitudes in the narrow seas
1003,MESSENGER,"Were thronged and hampered, nor could any now"
1004,MESSENGER,"Bear help to other--yea, and many a time"
1005,MESSENGER,"Friend hurtled upon friend, or rent away"
1006,MESSENGER,With shearing prow her whole array of oars.
1007,MESSENGER,Meanwhile the Greeks around us fiercely charged
1008,MESSENGER,From every side at once; the lighter barques
1009,MESSENGER,"Were soon o'erset; the very seas were hid,"
1010,MESSENGER,So strewn with wreck and slaughter; every strand
1011,MESSENGER,And jutting rock-ledge was with corpses piled.
1012,MESSENGER,"We pressed in ruinous disordered flight,"
1013,MESSENGER,All that was left of Persia's mighty fleet;
1014,MESSENGER,"While they, like fishers when the tunnies swarm"
1015,MESSENGER,"Within some narrow inlet, slew amain"
1016,MESSENGER,"With aught that hand could seize--with shivered oars,"
1017,MESSENGER,"Fragments of wreck, they stabb'd, they stunn'd, they clove;"
1018,MESSENGER,And out beyond the channel shrieks and wails
1019,MESSENGER,And panic fear possessed the open sea.
1020,MESSENGER,"Gods! could I speak, nor cease for ten full days,"
1021,MESSENGER,I had not told how thick disasters came!
1022,MESSENGER,"Know this, that never since the world began"

1337,NATHAN,"An opal, where a hundred lovely tints"
1338,NATHAN,"Played, and where dwelt the magic power to make"
1339,NATHAN,Well-pleasing in the sight of God and man

1342,NATHAN,He made provision to retain it ever
1343,NATHAN,"In his own House, an heirloom for all time?"
1344,NATHAN,Thus did he order it: He left the Ring
1345,NATHAN,"First to his best-belovèd son, ordaining"
1346,NATHAN,That he in turn should leave it to the son
1347,NATHAN,He dearliest loved; and so to the dearest ever.
1348,NATHAN,"And still the owner of the Ring, apart"
1349,NATHAN,"From precedence of birth, by that alone"

1361,NATHAN,"Whom therefore he, perforce, must love alike;"
1362,NATHAN,"Only, from time to time the first would seem"
1363,NATHAN,"Most worthy of the Ring, and then the next,"
1364,NATHAN,"And then again the third,--as each he found"
1365,NATHAN,"Alone with him, the other two not by"
1366,NATHAN,To share his overflowing love. To each
1367,NATHAN,His heart's fond weakness made him pledge the Ring.
1368,NATHAN,Thus all went smoothly ... while it could. But now
1369,NATHAN,"His time to die draws near, and, sore perplexed,"
1370,NATHAN,The good man rues that two of the three sons
1371,NATHAN,"That trusted in his word, must soon be left"
1372,NATHAN,"Deceived, affronted.... Mark, now, his device!"
1373,NATHAN,All secretly he summons to his aid
1374,NATHAN,"A cunning craftsman, and commands him fashion"
1375,NATHAN,"After the pattern of his Ring, two others;"
1376,NATHAN,"No cost, no labour to be spared, to make them"

1378,NATHAN,And so 'tis done; and when the craftsman brings
1379,NATHAN,"The finished work, not even the father's eye"
1380,NATHAN,Can tell his own ring from the copies. Now
1381,NATHAN,Joyfully doth he summon to his side
1382,NATHAN,"His three sons, one by one, and, one by one,"

1402,NATHAN,[_After a pause in which he waits for

1409,SALADIN,

1413,NATHAN,
1414,NATHAN,"Nay, this shall but excuse me, if I trust not"

1416,NATHAN,Made by the Father to the very intent
1417,NATHAN,That they should never be distinguished.

1424,SALADIN,"Were easily distinguished, even to points"

1426,SALADIN,
1427,NATHAN,NATHAN
1428,NATHAN,
1429,NATHAN,Only not
1430,NATHAN,In this one thing--their proofs. All rest alike
1431,NATHAN,"On history, or written or handed down."
1432,NATHAN,And history we take--is it not so?--
1433,NATHAN,"On faith and trust alone. Whose faith, whose truth,"
1434,NATHAN,Shall we confide in most? Surely in those
1435,NATHAN,"Of our own folk, whose blood we are, whose proofs"
1436,NATHAN,"Of love were given us from our childhood up,"
1437,NATHAN,"Who ne'er deceived us, saving when, perchance,"
1438,NATHAN,"'Twere better for our weal. If this be so,"
1439,NATHAN,How can I less in my forefathers trust
1440,NATHAN,Than thou in thine? Or take the other side:
1441,NATHAN,Can I demand from thee that thou shouldst charge
1442,NATHAN,"Thine ancestors with lying, but for this,"
1443,NATHAN,"That mine be justified? Again, the Christian"
1444,NATHAN,To both of us may plead the like defence.
1445,NATHAN,Art thou not answered?
1446,NATHAN,
1447,NATHAN,SALADIN (_aside_)
1448,NATHAN,
1449,NATHAN,By the living God
1450,NATHAN,The man is right! I must be dumb.
1451,NATHAN,
1452,NATHAN,NATHAN
1453,NATHAN,
1454,NATHAN,Now turn we
1455,NATHAN,"Back to our rings again.--I said, the sons"
1456,NATHAN,Made their complaints: each one before the Judge
1457,NATHAN,Made oath that from his father's very hand
1458,NATHAN,He had the Ring--and so in truth he had--
1459,NATHAN,"After his father's promise, long before,"
1460,NATHAN,That one day he should own the Ring and all
1461,NATHAN,"Its rights--and this no less was true. The father,"
1462,NATHAN,"Each one averr'd, could ne'er have played him false."
1463,NATHAN,Rather than credit this--rather than nurse
1464,NATHAN,"Against so loved a father, such a thought,"
1465,NATHAN,How fain soever he had been to think
1466,NATHAN,"Nothing but good of them, he must believe"
1467,NATHAN,His brothers guilty of foul treachery.
1468,NATHAN,But surely one day he would find a way
1469,NATHAN,To unmask the villains--he would be avenged!

1471,SALADIN,SALADIN
1472,SALADIN,
1473,SALADIN,"And now, the Judge? I am intent to hear"

1476,NATHAN,NATHAN
1477,NATHAN,
1478,NATHAN,"On this wise spake the Judge: ""Either ye bring"
1479,NATHAN,"Right soon your father here before me, else"
1480,NATHAN,I spurn you from my seat. What! think ye I
1481,NATHAN,Am here to answer riddles? Or do ye wait
1482,NATHAN,Until the true Ring find a tongue and speak?
1483,NATHAN,Yet stay! 'Tis said that in the true Ring lives
1484,NATHAN,"A magic gift, to make the owner loved--"
1485,NATHAN,"Well-pleasing before God and man. So good,"
1486,NATHAN,"This shall decide the cause; for never, surely,"
1487,NATHAN,In this the false can emulate the true.
1488,NATHAN,Which of the three of ye is best beloved
1489,NATHAN,"By the other twain? Marry, speak out! Ye are dumb!"
1490,NATHAN,"Mysterious power, that only backward works,"
1491,NATHAN,"Not outward from within! Lo, each of you"
1492,NATHAN,Loves best of all--himself! So are ye all
1493,NATHAN,"Deceived, and all deceivers. All your rings"
1494,NATHAN,Are manifestly false. Belike the true
1495,NATHAN,Was irrecoverably lost; and so
1496,NATHAN,"Your father, to conceal the loss, made three"
1497,NATHAN,"In place of one."""

1507,NATHAN,"Such as I can, will none--I bid you hence."
1508,NATHAN,"But, if I counselled you, my rede were this:"
1509,NATHAN,Take ye the matter simply as it lies.
1510,NATHAN,Each from your father had his ring--let each
1511,NATHAN,Be well persuaded that the ring he holds
1512,NATHAN,Is the true Ring. It may be that your father
1513,NATHAN,Was minded to maintain the tyranny
1514,NATHAN,Of the one Ring no longer. And 'tis certain
1515,NATHAN,"He loved you all, and loved you each alike."
1516,NATHAN,"Would not have one exalted, one oppressed."
1517,NATHAN,Mark that! and be it yours to emulate
1518,NATHAN,"His great impartial love. Strive, each of you,"
1519,NATHAN,To show the Ring's benignant might his own;
1520,NATHAN,"Yea, help the mystic power to do its kind,"
1521,NATHAN,"With gentleness, with loving courtesy,"
1522,NATHAN,"Beneficence to man, and unto God"
1523,NATHAN,The deep devotion of the inmost soul.
1524,NATHAN,"And when, full many a generation hence,"
1525,NATHAN,Within your children's children's children's hearts
1526,NATHAN,"The mystery of the Ring is manifest,"
1527,NATHAN,"Lo! in a thousand thousand years, again"
1528,NATHAN,"Before this judgment-seat I summon you,"
1529,NATHAN,Where one more wise than I shall sit and speak.
1530,NATHAN,"Now go your ways."" So spake the modest Judge."
