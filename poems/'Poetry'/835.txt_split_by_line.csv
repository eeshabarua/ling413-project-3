48,,
49,,"THERE is need to ask indulgence for this little book, because at first"
50,,sight it seems to possess no other unity than that of type and cover.
51,,"The root of its unity lies deeper, deeper even than any of subject or of"
52,,"method; it lies in the personal gift, the communication of heart to"
53,,"heart, which is the secret of charm in all the author’s work.  For this"
54,,reason its publication is justified.
55,,
56,,"The papers, poems, and stories it contains have, with two exceptions,"
57,,"appeared elsewhere, most of them in ‘The Pilot,’ where the Roadmender"
58,,found his first welcome and his literary home.
59,,
60,,The fairy-tales were told by word of mouth to one child and another of
61,,widely differing ages; and three of them were afterwards published in
62,,‘The Parents’ Review.’  ‘The Grey Brethren’ is from ‘The Commonwealth.’
63,,The Christmas papers and poems were brought out as a booklet by Messrs
64,,Mowbray & Son.
65,,
66,,"The author’s characteristic quality is best displayed in these last, and"
67,,"in ‘The Grey Brethren,’ but there will be interest for many readers in"
68,,the rest of the book as well.  That which afterwards became a firm
69,,artistic touch is seen in its uncertain beginning in ‘By Rivers and
70,,Streams’; and the delightful headlong humour of ‘The Dreadful Griffin’
71,,"(invented for the “boy named Cecco Hewlett,” of whom Mr Barrie speaks in"
72,,his ‘Little White Bird’) will shew Michael Fairless in a new light to
73,,those who have known her only in her books.
74,,
75,,Some of the many readers who have found her there will understand me when
76,,"I say that the story of her life and death, and of her life too (as I"
77,,"believe) after death, is written down in the little tale of ‘The"
78,,"Tinkle-Tinkle,’ first told to her best beloved in the wild garden at Kew,"
79,,among blue hyacinths and shining grasses of the spring that spoke to her
80,,of Paradise.

801,BETHLEHEM,While slow mists gather in shrouding tears
802,BETHLEHEM,On All Souls’ Day; and the bells are slow
803,BETHLEHEM,In steeple and tower.  Sad folk go
804,BETHLEHEM,"Away from the township, past the mill,"
805,BETHLEHEM,And mount the slope of a grassy hill
806,BETHLEHEM,"Carved into terraces broad and steep,"
807,BETHLEHEM,"To the inn where wearied travellers sleep,"
808,BETHLEHEM,"Where the sleepers lie in ordered rows,"
809,BETHLEHEM,And no man stirs in his long repose.
810,BETHLEHEM,"They wend their way past the haunts of life,"
811,BETHLEHEM,"Father and daughter, grandmother, wife,"
812,BETHLEHEM,"To deck with candle and deathless cross,"
813,BETHLEHEM,The house which holds their dearest loss.
814,BETHLEHEM,"I, who stand on the crest of the hill,"
815,BETHLEHEM,"Watch how beneath me, busied still,"
816,BETHLEHEM,The sad folk wreathe each grave with flowers.
817,BETHLEHEM,Awhile the veil of the twilight hours
818,BETHLEHEM,"Falls softly, softly, over the hill,"
819,BETHLEHEM,Shadows the cross:—creeps on until
820,BETHLEHEM,Swiftly upon us is flung the dark.
821,BETHLEHEM,"Then, as if lit by a sudden spark,"
822,BETHLEHEM,"Each grave is vivid with points of light,"
823,BETHLEHEM,Earth is as Heaven’s mirror to-night;
824,BETHLEHEM,"The air is still as a spirit’s breath,"
825,BETHLEHEM,The lights burn bright in the realm of Death.
826,BETHLEHEM,"Then silent the mourners mourning go,"
827,BETHLEHEM,Wending their way to the church below;
828,BETHLEHEM,"While the bells toll out to bid them speed,"
829,BETHLEHEM,"With eager Pater and prayerful bead,"
830,BETHLEHEM,"The souls of the dead, whose bodies still"
831,BETHLEHEM,Lie in the churchyard under the hill;
832,BETHLEHEM,"While they wait and wonder in Paradise,"
833,BETHLEHEM,"And gaze on the dawning mysteries,"
834,BETHLEHEM,Praying for us in our hours of need;
835,BETHLEHEM,"For us, who with Pater and prayerful bead"
836,BETHLEHEM,Have bidden those waiting spirits speed.

841,BETHLEHEM,Rivers and Streams
842,BETHLEHEM,
843,BETHLEHEM,
844,BETHLEHEM,RUNNING water has a charm all its own; it proffers companionship of which
845,BETHLEHEM,one never tires; it adapts itself to moods; it is the guardian of
846,BETHLEHEM,secrets.  It has cool draughts for the thirsty soul as well as for
847,BETHLEHEM,drooping flowers; and they who wander in the garden of God with listening
848,BETHLEHEM,ears learn of its many voices.
849,BETHLEHEM,
850,BETHLEHEM,"When the strain of a working day has left me weary, perhaps troubled and"
851,BETHLEHEM,"perplexed, I find my way to the river.  I step into a boat and pull up"
852,BETHLEHEM,stream until the exertion has refreshed me; and then I make fast to the
853,BETHLEHEM,"old alder-stump where last year the reed-piper nested, and lie back in"
854,BETHLEHEM,the stern and think.
855,BETHLEHEM,
856,BETHLEHEM,The water laps against the keel as the boat rocks gently in the current;
857,BETHLEHEM,"the river flows past, strong and quiet.  There are side eddies, of"
858,BETHLEHEM,"course, and little disturbing whirlpools near the big stones, but they"
859,BETHLEHEM,"are all gathered into the broad sweep of the stream, carried down to the"
860,BETHLEHEM,great catholic sea.  And while I listen to the murmur of the water and
861,BETHLEHEM,watch its quiet strength the day’s wrinkles are smoothed out of my face;
862,BETHLEHEM,and at last the river bears me homeward rested and at peace.
863,BETHLEHEM,
864,BETHLEHEM,There are long stretches of time for me when I must remain apart from the
865,BETHLEHEM,"world of work, often unwilling, sometimes with a very sore heart.  Then I"
866,BETHLEHEM,"turn my steps towards my friend and wander along the banks, a solitary"
867,BETHLEHEM,"not alone.  In the quiet evening light I watch the stream ‘never hasting,"
868,BETHLEHEM,"never resting’: the grass that grows beside it is always green, the"
869,BETHLEHEM,flowers are fresh; it makes long embracing curves—I could cross from
870,BETHLEHEM,"point to point in a minute, but to follow takes five.  The ways of the"
871,BETHLEHEM,"water are ways of healing; I have a companion who makes no mistakes,"
872,BETHLEHEM,touches none of my tender spots.
873,BETHLEHEM,
874,BETHLEHEM,"Presently I reach the silent pool, where the stream takes a wide sweep."
875,BETHLEHEM,Here the fair white water-lilies lie on their broad green leaves and wait
876,BETHLEHEM,for their lover the moon; for then they open their silvery leaves and
877,BETHLEHEM,bloom in the soft light fairer far than beneath the hot rays of the sun.
878,BETHLEHEM,"Then, too, the buds rise out of the water and the moon kisses them into"
879,BETHLEHEM,"bloom and fragrance.  Near by are the little yellow water-lilies, set for"
880,BETHLEHEM,beauty against a background of great blue-eyed forget-me-nots and tall
881,BETHLEHEM,"feathery meadowsweet.  The river still sweeps on its way, but the pool is"
882,BETHLEHEM,undisturbed; it lies out of the current.  They say it is very deep—no one
883,BETHLEHEM,knows quite how deep—and it has its hidden tragedy.  I gaze down through
884,BETHLEHEM,"the clear water, following the thick lily-stalks—a forest where solemn"
885,BETHLEHEM,carp sail in and out and perch chase each other through the maze—and
886,BETHLEHEM,"beyond them I cannot see the bottom, the secret of its stillness; but I"
887,BETHLEHEM,"may watch the clouds mirrored on its surface, and the evening glow lying"
888,BETHLEHEM,at my feet.
889,BETHLEHEM,
890,BETHLEHEM,"I think of the fathomless depths of the peace of God, fair with flowers"
891,BETHLEHEM,"of hope; of still places wrought in man; of mirrors that reflect, in"
892,BETHLEHEM,"light uncomprehended, the Image of the Holy Face."
893,BETHLEHEM,
894,BETHLEHEM,"I go home across the common, comforted, towards the little town where the"
895,BETHLEHEM,"red roofs lie glimmering in the evening shadows, and the old grey church"
896,BETHLEHEM,stands out clear and distinct against the fading sky.

898,BETHLEHEM,* * * * *
899,BETHLEHEM,
900,BETHLEHEM,One of the happiest memories of my childhood is the little brook in the
901,BETHLEHEM,home field.  I know it was not a very clean little brook—it passed
902,BETHLEHEM,through an industrious manufacturing world—but to me then this mattered
903,BETHLEHEM,not at all.
904,BETHLEHEM,
905,BETHLEHEM,Where it had its source I never found out; it came from a little cave in
906,BETHLEHEM,"the side of the hill, and I remember that one of its banks was always"
907,BETHLEHEM,"higher than the other.  I once sought to penetrate the cave, but with sad"
908,BETHLEHEM,"results in the shape of bed before dinner and no pudding, such small"
909,BETHLEHEM,sympathy have one’s elders with the spirit of research.  Just beyond the
910,BETHLEHEM,"cave the brook was quite a respectable width,—even my big boy cousin fell"
911,BETHLEHEM,into mud and disgrace when he tried to jump it—and there was a gravelly
912,BETHLEHEM,"beach, at least several inches square, where we launched our boats of"
913,BETHLEHEM,"hollowed elder-wood.  Soon, however, it narrowed, it could even be"
914,BETHLEHEM,"stepped over; but it was still exciting and delightful, with two perilous"
915,BETHLEHEM,"rapids over which the boats had to be guided, and many boulders—for the"
916,BETHLEHEM,"brook was a brave stream, and had fashioned its bed in rocky soil."
917,BETHLEHEM,"Further down was our bridge, one flat stone dragged thither by really"
918,BETHLEHEM,"herculean efforts.  It was unnecessary, but a triumph.  A little below"
919,BETHLEHEM,this outcome of our engineering skill the brook widened again before
920,BETHLEHEM,"disappearing under a flagged tunnel into the neighbouring field.  Here,"
921,BETHLEHEM,"in the shallows, we built an aquarium.  It was not altogether successful,"
922,BETHLEHEM,because whenever it rained at all hard the beasts were washed out; but
923,BETHLEHEM,there was always joy in restocking it.  Under one of the banks close by
924,BETHLEHEM,lived a fat frog for whom I felt great respect.  We used to sit and gaze
925,BETHLEHEM,"at each other in silent intercourse, until he became bored—I think I"
926,BETHLEHEM,never did—and flopped into the water with a splash.
927,BETHLEHEM,
928,BETHLEHEM,But it was the brook itself that was my chief and dearest companion.  It
929,BETHLEHEM,"chattered and sang to me, and told me of the goblins who lived under the"
930,BETHLEHEM,"hill, of fairies dancing on the grass on moonlight nights, and scolding"
931,BETHLEHEM,the pale lilac milk-maids on the banks; and of a sad little old man
932,BETHLEHEM,"dressed in brown, always sad because his dear water-children ran away"
933,BETHLEHEM,from him when they heard the voice of the great river telling them of the
934,BETHLEHEM,calling of the sea.
935,BETHLEHEM,
936,BETHLEHEM,"It spoke to me of other more wonderful things, not even now to be put"
937,BETHLEHEM,"into words, things of the mysteries of a child’s imagination; and these"
938,BETHLEHEM,"linger still in my life, and will linger, I think, until they are"
939,BETHLEHEM,fulfilled.
940,BETHLEHEM,
941,BETHLEHEM,* * * * *
942,BETHLEHEM,
943,BETHLEHEM,I have another friend—a Devonshire stream.  I found it in spring when the
944,BETHLEHEM,fields along its banks were golden with Lent-lilies.  I do not even know
945,BETHLEHEM,"its name; it has its source up among the old grey tors, and doubtless in"
946,BETHLEHEM,its beginning had a hard fight for existence.  When it reaches the plain
947,BETHLEHEM,"it is a good-sized stream, although nowhere navigable.  I do not think it"
948,BETHLEHEM,even turns a mill; it just flows along and waters the flowers.  I have
949,BETHLEHEM,seen it with my bodily eyes only once; but it has left in my life a
950,BETHLEHEM,"blessing, a picture of blue sky, yellow bells, and clear rippling"
951,BETHLEHEM,water—and whispered secrets not forgotten.
952,BETHLEHEM,
953,BETHLEHEM,All the Devonshire streams are full of life and strength.  They chatter
954,BETHLEHEM,"cheerily over stones, they toil bravely to shape out their bed.  Some of"
955,BETHLEHEM,"them might tell horrible tales of the far-away past, of the worship of"
956,BETHLEHEM,"the false god when blood stained the clear waters; tales, too, of feud"
957,BETHLEHEM,"and warfare, of grave council and martial gathering; and happy stories of"
958,BETHLEHEM,"fairy and pixy our eyes are too dull to see, and of queer little hillmen"
959,BETHLEHEM,with foreign ways and terror of all human beings.  Their banks are bright
960,BETHLEHEM,"with tormentil, blue with forget-me-not, rich in treasures of starry"
961,BETHLEHEM,"moss; the water is clear, cool in the hottest summer—they rise under the"
962,BETHLEHEM,"shadow of the everlasting hills, and their goal is the sea."
963,BETHLEHEM,
964,BETHLEHEM,* * * * *
965,BETHLEHEM,
966,BETHLEHEM,There are other times when I must leave the clean waters and the good
967,BETHLEHEM,"brown earth, to live, for a while, in London: and there I go on"
968,BETHLEHEM,pilgrimage that I may listen to the river’s voice.
969,BETHLEHEM,
970,BETHLEHEM,I stand sometimes at a wharf where the ships are being unloaded of the
971,BETHLEHEM,"riches of every country, of fruits of labour by my unknown brothers in"
972,BETHLEHEM,strange lands; and the river speaks of citizenship in the great world of
973,BETHLEHEM,"God, wherein all men have place, each man have his own place, and every"
974,BETHLEHEM,one should be neighbour to him who may have need.
975,BETHLEHEM,
976,BETHLEHEM,"I pass on to London Bridge, our Bridge of Sighs.  How many of these my"
977,BETHLEHEM,brethren have sought refuge in the cold grey arms of the river from
978,BETHLEHEM,something worse than death?  What drove them to this dreadful
979,BETHLEHEM,"resting-place?  What spectre hurried them to the leap?  These things,"
980,BETHLEHEM,"too, are my concern, the river says."
981,BETHLEHEM,
982,BETHLEHEM,"Life is very grim in London: it is not painted in the fair, glowing"
983,BETHLEHEM,"colours of grass and sky and trees, and shining streams that bring peace."
984,BETHLEHEM,It is drawn in hard black and white; but the voice of its dark waters
985,BETHLEHEM,must be heard all the same.
986,BETHLEHEM,

988,BETHLEHEM,
989,BETHLEHEM,"I would not leave my rivers in the shadow.  After all, this life is only"
990,BETHLEHEM,"a prelude, a beginning: we pass on to where “the rivers and streams make"
991,BETHLEHEM,glad the city of God.”  But if we will not listen here how shall we
992,BETHLEHEM,understand hereafter.

996,BETHLEHEM,
997,BETHLEHEM,Spring
998,BETHLEHEM,
999,BETHLEHEM,
1000,BETHLEHEM,"HARK how the merry daffodils,"
1001,BETHLEHEM,Fling golden music to the hills!
1002,BETHLEHEM,"And how the hills send echoing down,"
1003,BETHLEHEM,"Through wind-swept turf and moorland brown,"
1004,BETHLEHEM,The murmurs of a thousand rills
1005,BETHLEHEM,That mock the song-birds’ liquid trills!
1006,BETHLEHEM,The hedge released from Winter’s frown
1007,BETHLEHEM,Shews jewelled branch and willow crown;
1008,BETHLEHEM,"While all the earth with pleasure trills,"
1009,BETHLEHEM,And ‘dances with the daffodils.’
1010,BETHLEHEM,
1011,BETHLEHEM,"Out, out, ye flowers!  Up and shout!"
1012,BETHLEHEM,Staid Winter’s passed and Spring’s about
1013,BETHLEHEM,To lead your ranks in joyous rout;
1014,BETHLEHEM,"To string the hawthorn’s milky pearls,"
1015,BETHLEHEM,And gild the grass with celandine;
1016,BETHLEHEM,"To dress the catkins’ tasselled curls,"
1017,BETHLEHEM,To twist the tendrils of the vine.
1018,BETHLEHEM,"She wakes the wind-flower from her sleep,"
1019,BETHLEHEM,And lights the woods with April’s moon;
1020,BETHLEHEM,"The violets lift their heads to peep,"
1021,BETHLEHEM,The daisies brave the sun at noon.
1022,BETHLEHEM,
1023,BETHLEHEM,The gentle wind from out the west
1024,BETHLEHEM,Toys with the lilac pretty maids;
1025,BETHLEHEM,"Ruffles the meadow’s verdant-vest,"
1026,BETHLEHEM,And rings the bluebells in the glades;
1027,BETHLEHEM,"The ash-buds change their sombre suit,"
1028,BETHLEHEM,The orchards blossom white and red—
1029,BETHLEHEM,"Promise of Autumn’s riper fruit,"
1030,BETHLEHEM,When Spring’s voluptuousness has fled.
1031,BETHLEHEM,"Awake! awake, O throstle sweet!"
1032,BETHLEHEM,And haste with all your choir to greet
1033,BETHLEHEM,This Queen who comes with wakening feet.
1034,BETHLEHEM,
1035,BETHLEHEM,Persephone with grateful eyes
1036,BETHLEHEM,Salutes the Sun—’tis Paradise:
1037,BETHLEHEM,"Then hastens down the dewy meads,"
1038,BETHLEHEM,"Past where the herd contented feeds,"
1039,BETHLEHEM,"Past where the furrows hide the grain,"
1040,BETHLEHEM,For harvesting of sun and rain;
1041,BETHLEHEM,To where Demeter patient stands
1042,BETHLEHEM,"With longing lips and outstretched hands,"
1043,BETHLEHEM,Until the dawning of one face
1044,BETHLEHEM,Across the void of time and space
1045,BETHLEHEM,Shall bring again her day of grace.
1046,BETHLEHEM,"Rejoice, O Earth!  Rejoice and sing!"
1047,BETHLEHEM,"This is the promise of the Spring,"
1048,BETHLEHEM,And this the world’s remembering.

1059,BETHLEHEM,The air slips by
1060,BETHLEHEM,On either side
1061,BETHLEHEM,As up I ride
1062,BETHLEHEM,"On mounting wing,"
1063,BETHLEHEM,And sing and sing—
1064,BETHLEHEM,"Then reach my bliss,"
1065,BETHLEHEM,The sun’s great kiss;
1066,BETHLEHEM,And poise a space
1067,BETHLEHEM,"To see his face,"
1068,BETHLEHEM,"Sweet, sweet,"

1073,BETHLEHEM,Beneath my feet

1075,BETHLEHEM,And down I fall
1076,BETHLEHEM,"Unerring, true,"
1077,BETHLEHEM,Through heaven’s blue;
1078,BETHLEHEM,And haste to fill
1079,BETHLEHEM,Each noisy bill.
1080,BETHLEHEM,My brooding breast
1081,BETHLEHEM,Stills their unrest.
1082,BETHLEHEM,"Sweet, sweet,"
1083,BETHLEHEM,"Their quick hearts beat,"
1084,BETHLEHEM,Safe in the nest:
1085,BETHLEHEM,"Ah, sweet, sweet, sweet!"
1086,BETHLEHEM,"Ah, sweet!"
1087,BETHLEHEM,
1088,BETHLEHEM,"Sweet, sweet"
1089,BETHLEHEM,The calling sky
1090,BETHLEHEM,That bids me fly
1091,BETHLEHEM,Up—up—on high.
1092,BETHLEHEM,"Sweet, sweet"
1093,BETHLEHEM,The claiming earth;
1094,BETHLEHEM,It holds my nest
1095,BETHLEHEM,And draws me down
1096,BETHLEHEM,To where Love’s crown
1097,BETHLEHEM,Of priceless worth
1098,BETHLEHEM,Awaits my breast.
1099,BETHLEHEM,"Sweet, sweet!"
1100,BETHLEHEM,"Ah, this is best"

1107,BETHLEHEM,‘Luvly Miss’
1108,BETHLEHEM,
1109,BETHLEHEM,
1110,BETHLEHEM,NOBODY thought of consequences.  There was a lighted paraffin lamp on the
1111,BETHLEHEM,table and nothing else handy.  Mrs Brown’s head presented a tempting
1112,BETHLEHEM,"mark, and of course Mr Brown’s lengthy stay at ‘The Three Fingers’ had"
1113,BETHLEHEM,"something to do with it; but nobody thought of Miss Brown, aged four, who"
1114,BETHLEHEM,"was playing happily on the floor, unruffled by the storm to which she was"
1115,BETHLEHEM,so well accustomed.
1116,BETHLEHEM,
1117,BETHLEHEM,"Mrs Brown ducked; there was a smash, a scream, and poor little Miss Brown"
1118,BETHLEHEM,was in a blaze.  The shock sobered the father and silenced the mother.
1119,BETHLEHEM,"Miss Brown was extinguished with the aid of a table-cover, much water,"
1120,BETHLEHEM,"and many neighbours; but she was horribly burnt all over, except her"
1121,BETHLEHEM,face.
1122,BETHLEHEM,
1123,BETHLEHEM,* * * * *
1124,BETHLEHEM,
1125,BETHLEHEM,I made Miss Brown’s acquaintance a few days later.  She was lying on a
1126,BETHLEHEM,"bed made up on two chairs, and was covered with cotton wool.  She had"
1127,BETHLEHEM,"scarcely any pain, and could not move at all; and the small face that"
1128,BETHLEHEM,peered out of what she called her “pitty warm snow” was wan and drawn and
1129,BETHLEHEM,had a far-away look in the dark eyes.
1130,BETHLEHEM,
1131,BETHLEHEM,"Miss Brown possessed one treasure, her ‘luvly miss.’  I suppose I must"
1132,BETHLEHEM,"call it a doll, though in what its claim to the title consisted I dared"
1133,BETHLEHEM,not ask; Miss Brown would have deeply resented the enquiry.  It was a
1134,BETHLEHEM,very large potato with a large and a small bulge.  Into the large bulge
1135,BETHLEHEM,"were inserted three pieces of fire-wood, the body and arms of ‘luvly"
1136,BETHLEHEM,miss’; legs she had none.
1137,BETHLEHEM,
1138,BETHLEHEM,How Miss Brown came by this treasure I never heard.  She had an
1139,BETHLEHEM,impression that it “flied froo the winder”—I fancy Mr Brown had a hand in
1140,BETHLEHEM,the manufacture in one of his lucid moments; but it was a treasure indeed
1141,BETHLEHEM,and the joy of Miss Brown’s life.  She held long conversations with
1142,BETHLEHEM,‘luvly miss’ on all familiar subjects; and apparently obtained much
1143,BETHLEHEM,"strange and rare information from her.  For example, Miss Brown and"
1144,BETHLEHEM,‘luvly miss’ in some previous stage of their existence had inhabited a
1145,BETHLEHEM,"large chimney-pot together, “where it was always so warm and a bootie"
1146,BETHLEHEM,‘mell of cookin’.’”  Also she had a rooted belief that one day she and
1147,BETHLEHEM,‘luvly miss’ would be “hangels wiv’ black weils and basticks.”  This
1148,BETHLEHEM,"puzzled me for some time, until I discovered it to be an allusion to the"
1149,BETHLEHEM,"good deaconess who attended her, and whom Mrs Brown in gratitude"
1150,BETHLEHEM,designated by this title.
1151,BETHLEHEM,
1152,BETHLEHEM,Alas for little Miss Brown and her ‘luvly miss’! their respective ends
1153,BETHLEHEM,"were drawing near.  I went in one Friday, a week or so after the"
1154,BETHLEHEM,"accident, and found Mrs Brown in tears and despair, and Miss Brown with a"
1155,BETHLEHEM,look of anguish on her poor little pinched face that was bad to see.
1156,BETHLEHEM,‘Luvly Miss’ was no more.
1157,BETHLEHEM,
1158,BETHLEHEM,"It was Mr Brown again; or, to trace back the links of occasion, it was"
1159,BETHLEHEM,the action of ‘The Three Fingers’ on Mr Brown’s frail constitution.  He
1160,BETHLEHEM,"had come in late, seen ‘luvly miss’ on the table, and, with his usual"
1161,BETHLEHEM,"heedlessness of consequence, had chucked her into the dying embers"
1162,BETHLEHEM,where—alas that I should have to say it!—she slowly baked.  Little Miss
1163,BETHLEHEM,"Brown, when the miserable truth was broken to her, neither wept nor"
1164,BETHLEHEM,remonstrated; she lay quite still with a look of utter forsaken
1165,BETHLEHEM,"wretchedness on her tiny white face, and moaned very softly for ‘luvly"
1166,BETHLEHEM,miss.’
1167,BETHLEHEM,
1168,BETHLEHEM,I came face to face with this state of things and I confess it staggered
1169,BETHLEHEM,me.  I knew Miss Brown too well to hope that any pink-and-white darling
1170,BETHLEHEM,"from the toy-shop could replace ‘luvly miss,’ or that she could be"
1171,BETHLEHEM,persuaded to admit even a very image of the dear departed into her
1172,BETHLEHEM,"affections.  Then, too, the doctor said Miss Brown had but a few days at"
1173,BETHLEHEM,"the most, perhaps only hours, to live; and comforted she must be."
1174,BETHLEHEM,
1175,BETHLEHEM,"All at once I had an inspiration, and never in my life have I welcomed"
1176,BETHLEHEM,one more.  I knelt down by little Miss Brown and told her the story of
1177,BETHLEHEM,the Phoenix.  I had not reckoned in vain upon her imagination: would I
1178,BETHLEHEM,“yerely and twooly bwing” her “werry own luvly miss out of the ashes?”  I
1179,BETHLEHEM,"lied cheerfully and hastened away to the dust-bin, accompanied by Mrs"
1180,BETHLEHEM,Brown.
1181,BETHLEHEM,
1182,BETHLEHEM,"In a few minutes we returned with a pail of ashes, the ashes, of course,"
1183,BETHLEHEM,of ‘luvly miss’ mingled with those of the cruel fire which had consumed
1184,BETHLEHEM,"her.  I danced solemnly round them, murmured mysterious words, parted the"
1185,BETHLEHEM,"ashes, and revealed the form of ‘luvly miss.’  Love’s eyes were not sharp"
1186,BETHLEHEM,"to mark a change, and little Miss Brown’s misplaced faith in me was"
1187,BETHLEHEM,strong.  Never shall I forget the scream of joy which greeted the
1188,BETHLEHEM,"restored treasure, or the relief with which I saw an expression of peace"
1189,BETHLEHEM,settle once more on Miss Brown’s face.
1190,BETHLEHEM,
1191,BETHLEHEM,* * * * *
1192,BETHLEHEM,
1193,BETHLEHEM,I saw them again next day.  Little Miss Brown was asleep in her last
1194,BETHLEHEM,"little bed, still wrapped in the “pitty warm snow,” and ‘luvly miss’ lay"
1195,BETHLEHEM,beside her.

1200,BETHLEHEM,Four Stories Told to Children
1201,BETHLEHEM,
1202,BETHLEHEM,
1203,BETHLEHEM,The Story of the Dreadful Griffin.
1204,BETHLEHEM,
1205,BETHLEHEM,
1206,BETHLEHEM,"MY DEAR CHILDREN,—I am going to tell you a really breathless story for"
1207,BETHLEHEM,"your holiday treat.  It will have to begin with the moral, because"
1208,BETHLEHEM,"everyone will be too much exhausted to read one at the end, and as the"
1209,BETHLEHEM,"moral is the only part that really matters, it is important to come to it"
1210,BETHLEHEM,quite fresh.
1211,BETHLEHEM,
1212,BETHLEHEM,"We will, therefore, endeavour to learn from this story:—"
1213,BETHLEHEM,
1214,BETHLEHEM,"If we fly at all, to fly _high_."
1215,BETHLEHEM,To be extremely polite.
1216,BETHLEHEM,To be kind and grateful to cats and all other animals.
1217,BETHLEHEM,
1218,BETHLEHEM,All the trouble arose one day when the Princess (there is always a
1219,BETHLEHEM,"Princess in a fairy-tale, you know) was playing in the garden with her"
1220,BETHLEHEM,ball.  She threw it up in the air much higher than usual and it never
1221,BETHLEHEM,"came down again.  There was an awful shriek, like ten thousand"
1222,BETHLEHEM,"steam-engines; all the ladies-in-waiting fainted in a row, the"
1223,BETHLEHEM,"inhabitants of the place went stone-deaf, and the Captain of the Guard,"
1224,BETHLEHEM,"who was in attendance with a company of his troops, seized the Princess,"
1225,BETHLEHEM,"put her on his horse, galloped away followed by his soldiers to a castle"
1226,BETHLEHEM,"on the top of a hill, deposited the Princess in the highest room, and"
1227,BETHLEHEM,"then and only then, told her what had happened."
1228,BETHLEHEM,
1229,BETHLEHEM,"“Miss,” he said, for he was so upset he forgot Court etiquette, “Miss,"
1230,BETHLEHEM,your ball must have hit the Dreadful Griffin in the eye (I noticed he was
1231,BETHLEHEM,"taking a little fly in the neighbourhood), and that was the reason of the"
1232,BETHLEHEM,"awful shriek.  Well, Miss, the Dreadful Griffin never was known to"
1233,BETHLEHEM,"forgive anybody anything, so I snatched you up quick before he could get"
1234,BETHLEHEM,at you and brought you to the Castle of the White Cats.  There are
1235,BETHLEHEM,seventeen of these animals sitting outside the door and twenty-seven more
1236,BETHLEHEM,"standing in the courtyard, so you’re as safe as safe can be, for the"
1237,BETHLEHEM,Dreadful Griffin can’t look at a white cat without getting the ague and
1238,BETHLEHEM,"then he shakes so a mouse wouldn’t be afraid of him.  And now, Miss, I"
1239,BETHLEHEM,"must go back to your Royal Pa, so I will wish you good-morning.”"
1240,BETHLEHEM,
1241,BETHLEHEM,Having made this long speech the Captain suddenly remembered the Court
1242,BETHLEHEM,"etiquette, became very hot and red, went out of the room backwards, and"
1243,BETHLEHEM,"instantly fell over the seventeen cats who all swore at him, which so"
1244,BETHLEHEM,confused the poor man that he rolled down the stairs and out into the
1245,BETHLEHEM,court where the twenty-seven cats were having rations of mouse-pie served
1246,BETHLEHEM,"out to them; and the Captain rolled into the middle of the pie, scalded"
1247,BETHLEHEM,"himself badly with the gravy, and was thankful to jump on his horse and"
1248,BETHLEHEM,ride away with his soldiers to report matters to the King.
1249,BETHLEHEM,
1250,BETHLEHEM,The King was so pleased with his promptitude that he made him the General
1251,BETHLEHEM,"of the Flying Squadron, which only fights in the air, and conferred on"
1252,BETHLEHEM,him the medal of the Society for the Suppression of Superfluous
1253,BETHLEHEM,"Salamanders, whereat the Captain was overjoyed."
1254,BETHLEHEM,
1255,BETHLEHEM,"But this is a digression, and I only told you because I wanted you to see"
1256,BETHLEHEM,that virtue is always rewarded.
1257,BETHLEHEM,
1258,BETHLEHEM,Now for the poor Princess.
1259,BETHLEHEM,
1260,BETHLEHEM,"Well, she cried a little, of course, but the cats brought her some"
1261,BETHLEHEM,"mouse-pie, which she found very good, and she was soon quite happy"
1262,BETHLEHEM,playing with some of the kittens and nearly forgot all about the Dreadful
1263,BETHLEHEM,"Griffin; but he did not forget about _her_, oh dear no!  He flew after"
1264,BETHLEHEM,"the Captain when he galloped away with the Princess, but when he saw the"
1265,BETHLEHEM,White Cats he shook with ague so fearfully that his teeth rolled about in
1266,BETHLEHEM,his mouth like billiard balls and he had to go and get a new set before
1267,BETHLEHEM,"he could eat his dinner.  Well, he was in a perfect fury, and how to get"
1268,BETHLEHEM,at the Princess he did not know.  He swallowed several buckets of hot
1269,BETHLEHEM,"brimstone, rolled his head in a red flannel petticoat, put his tail in a"
1270,BETHLEHEM,"hot sand-bag, and went to bed hoping to cure the ague, which he did"
1271,BETHLEHEM,"completely, so that he was quite well next day and more anxious to eat"
1272,BETHLEHEM,the Princess than ever.
1273,BETHLEHEM,
1274,BETHLEHEM,"Now next door to the Dreadful Griffin (that is, a hundred miles away)"
1275,BETHLEHEM,"there lived a Wicked Witch, and he went to consult her as to how he might"
1276,BETHLEHEM,get at the Princess.  When the Wicked Witch heard what a sad effect White
1277,BETHLEHEM,Cats had on the Griffin’s constitution she said that she would have
1278,BETHLEHEM,expected a Griffin of his coils to have had more sense.
1279,BETHLEHEM,
1280,BETHLEHEM,"“Any slow-worm knows,” said the Wicked Witch, “that cats love mice better"
1281,BETHLEHEM,"than Princesses; therefore get a large sack of fat mice, let them loose a"
1282,BETHLEHEM,"little way from the castle, and when the cats see them they will run"
1283,BETHLEHEM,"after them, and you can eat the Princess.”"
1284,BETHLEHEM,
1285,BETHLEHEM,The Dreadful Griffin was so pleased with the Wicked Witch that he
1286,BETHLEHEM,"presented her with a pair of fire-bricks and a hot-water tin, and then"
1287,BETHLEHEM,"flew away to the Purveyor of Mice, who lived in a town about seventy"
1288,BETHLEHEM,"miles away.  He bought twelve hundred dozen fat mice of the best quality,"
1289,BETHLEHEM,"all the Purveyor had in stock that were home-grown, and flew on with them"
1290,BETHLEHEM,"to the castle.  When he was a little way off he let the mice out,"
1291,BETHLEHEM,expecting all the cats to arrive at once; but not a cat appeared.  They
1292,BETHLEHEM,"_heard_ mice and they _smelt_ mice, but not a cat moved, for they were on"
1293,BETHLEHEM,their honour; so they kept guard and licked their lips sadly.  When the
1294,BETHLEHEM,Griffin saw the last of the twelve hundred dozen mice disappearing down
1295,BETHLEHEM,"the road with never a cat after them, he was in a tremendous temper and"
1296,BETHLEHEM,"flew away to the house of the Wicked Witch, only stopping to pick up a"
1297,BETHLEHEM,"steam engine which he dropped through her roof, and then went home to"
1298,BETHLEHEM,"bed.  Next day he remembered a friend of his called the Grumpy Giant, who"
1299,BETHLEHEM,"lived six doors away, that is, about a thousand miles, so he flew to ask"
1300,BETHLEHEM,"his advice.  When the Giant heard his story, he said in the gruffest"
1301,BETHLEHEM,"voice you ever heard, “Mice is common, try sparrers” (by which you can"
1302,BETHLEHEM,"see that he was quite an uneducated person), and then he turned over and"
1303,BETHLEHEM,went to sleep.
1304,BETHLEHEM,
1305,BETHLEHEM,"The Dreadful Griffin at once flew away to the Sparrow Preserves, bought"
1306,BETHLEHEM,"eleven thousand, and then proceeded to let them fly close to the castle."
1307,BETHLEHEM,"Still not a cat moved.  As the cats’ copy-book well says, “Honour is"
1308,BETHLEHEM,"dearer to cats than mice or birds,” and all the kittens write this in"
1309,BETHLEHEM,"round-hand as soon as they can do lessons at all, and never forget it."
1310,BETHLEHEM,
1311,BETHLEHEM,"Well, I really dare not describe the state of mind the Griffin was in;"
1312,BETHLEHEM,but he made the air so hot that all the people put on their thinnest
1313,BETHLEHEM,"clothes, although it was the middle of winter.  He flew home puffing and"
1314,BETHLEHEM,"snorting, and on the way he passed the house of the Amiable Answerer.  He"
1315,BETHLEHEM,"went in and told his story, and his voice shook with rage.  The Amiable"
1316,BETHLEHEM,"Answerer gave him a penny pink ice to cool him down, and then said"
1317,BETHLEHEM,gently:—
1318,BETHLEHEM,
1319,BETHLEHEM,"“I think, dear Mr Griffin, that green spectacles would meet your case."
1320,BETHLEHEM,Then the cats which are now white would appear to you green and . . . ”
1321,BETHLEHEM,
1322,BETHLEHEM,But the Griffin was already half-way to a Watchmaker’s where they sold
1323,BETHLEHEM,"glasses.  He burst into the shop, frightened the watchmaker so that he"
1324,BETHLEHEM,fell into the works of the watch he was mending and could only be got out
1325,BETHLEHEM,"with the greatest difficulty, seized twelve pairs of green spectacles,"
1326,BETHLEHEM,put them on all at once and flew towards the castle.
1327,BETHLEHEM,
1328,BETHLEHEM,Now the Dreadful Griffin was one of those creatures who do not stop to
1329,BETHLEHEM,"think, consequently he came to grief.  White cats gave him the ague, but"
1330,BETHLEHEM,green dogs made him cough most fearfully; and a little way out of the
1331,BETHLEHEM,"town he met thirteen white poodles taking a walk, who of course all"
1332,BETHLEHEM,looked bright green to the Dreadful Griffin.  He coughed so fearfully
1333,BETHLEHEM,that all the twelve pairs of spectacles fell off his nose and were
1334,BETHLEHEM,"smashed to bits, and his plan was spoilt once more."
1335,BETHLEHEM,
1336,BETHLEHEM,"No, I am not going to tell you what the Dreadful Griffin said and did"
1337,BETHLEHEM,"then, it is too terrible to speak of, but he had to keep in bed for a"
1338,BETHLEHEM,"week, and drink hot tar, and have his chest ironed with a steam roller,"
1339,BETHLEHEM,and his nose greased with seven pounds of tallow candles; but all his
1340,BETHLEHEM,misfortunes did not cure him of wanting to eat the Princess.  When his
1341,BETHLEHEM,"cough was better, he went for a walk in the wood near which he lived, to"
1342,BETHLEHEM,"think out a new plan.  Suddenly he heard something croaking, and saw the"
1343,BETHLEHEM,Fat Frog sitting under a tree.  Now the Dreadful Griffin was so low in
1344,BETHLEHEM,"his mind that he wanted to tell someone his troubles, so he told the Fat"
1345,BETHLEHEM,Frog.
1346,BETHLEHEM,
1347,BETHLEHEM,"“Don’t come near me,” said the Fat Frog when he had finished, “for I hate"
1348,BETHLEHEM,heat.  If you look under the fifth tree from the end of the wood you’ll
1349,BETHLEHEM,find a thin packet.  Put it in sixteen gallons of water and pour it over
1350,BETHLEHEM,"the cats, only mind you shut your eyes first, and for goodness sake don’t"
1351,BETHLEHEM,"come into this wood any more, you dry up the moisture.”"
1352,BETHLEHEM,
1353,BETHLEHEM,"The Griffin quite forgot to thank the Fat Frog, he was a Griffin of _no_"
1354,BETHLEHEM,"manners, but he didn’t forget to take the packet.  It was labelled"
1355,BETHLEHEM,"‘Reckitt’s,’ and when he put it in the water all the water turned bright"
1356,BETHLEHEM,"blue.  Then he took the pail in his claw, flew to the castle, shut his"
1357,BETHLEHEM,eyes and poured some of the contents of the pail over the cats in the
1358,BETHLEHEM,courtyard.
1359,BETHLEHEM,
1360,BETHLEHEM,"When he opened his eyes there were twenty-seven bright blue, damp,"
1361,BETHLEHEM,depressed cats; and he passed them without any difficulty.  He shut his
1362,BETHLEHEM,"eyes, wriggled up the stairs, poured the remaining mixture over the"
1363,BETHLEHEM,"seventeen cats, who all turned as blue as the rest, and then he burst"
1364,BETHLEHEM,open the door of the Princess’s room.  Fortunately there was a kind Fairy
1365,BETHLEHEM,"flying over the castle at that very moment, who, seeing what was"
1366,BETHLEHEM,"happening, changed the Princess into a flea so that the Dreadful Griffin"
1367,BETHLEHEM,couldn’t see her anywhere.
1368,BETHLEHEM,
1369,BETHLEHEM,"No, if I couldn’t tell you before, I certainly must not attempt now to"
1370,BETHLEHEM,describe the Griffin’s behaviour when he found the Princess thus snatched
1371,BETHLEHEM,from his jaws.  He went grunting and bellowing and screaming along; and
1372,BETHLEHEM,just as he was stopping to take breath he heard someone roaring with
1373,BETHLEHEM,"laughter, and saw a little yellow man sitting on the top bough of a tree."
1374,BETHLEHEM,
1375,BETHLEHEM,“Are you laughing at ME?” said the Dreadful Griffin (he was so angry that
1376,BETHLEHEM,he was quite polite).  And the little man said quite as politely that he
1377,BETHLEHEM,certainly _was_.
1378,BETHLEHEM,
1379,BETHLEHEM,"“Why?” said the Dreadful Griffin, still fearfully polite."
1380,BETHLEHEM,
1381,BETHLEHEM,"“Because you’re such a green Griffin,” said the yellow man; and he"
1382,BETHLEHEM,"screamed with laughter again—“I know all about it, you’ve blued the cats"
1383,BETHLEHEM,"and now the Princess has greened you.  She’s turned into a flea, and you"
1384,BETHLEHEM,"still want to eat her, and it never occurred to you, you green old"
1385,BETHLEHEM,"grampus of a Griffin, that fleas like _cats_.  I suppose the Princess"
1386,BETHLEHEM,"flea wouldn’t jump on to a tabby kitten, and you couldn’t swallow the"
1387,BETHLEHEM,"kitten—oh dear, no—of course not . . .”"
1388,BETHLEHEM,
1389,BETHLEHEM,"But the Griffin was gone.  He went to the Zoo, found a tabby kitten,"
1390,BETHLEHEM,"though they are rare in that country, and flew back with it to the"
1391,BETHLEHEM,Princess’s room.
1392,BETHLEHEM,
1393,BETHLEHEM,He waited half an hour and then swallowed the kitten at one gulp; but he
1394,BETHLEHEM,"instantly burst in four pieces, for the fluffy kitten tickled his"
1395,BETHLEHEM,digestive organs so much that they cracked his sides and he died; and the
1396,BETHLEHEM,"flea and the kitten came out quite unhurt, only a little damp."
1397,BETHLEHEM,
1398,BETHLEHEM,Then a wonderful thing happened.  The tabby kitten changed into the
1399,BETHLEHEM,"little yellow man who had laughed at the Griffin.  He grew, and grew, and"
1400,BETHLEHEM,in a few minutes he was a handsome prince.  His name was Prince Orange
1401,BETHLEHEM,Plushikins.  One day a cruel witch whom he had offended had changed him
1402,BETHLEHEM,"into an ugly yellow man, and had sworn that he should only regain his"
1403,BETHLEHEM,shape if he was eaten by a Griffin when under the form of a tabby kitten;
1404,BETHLEHEM,"which you know was precisely what happened.  Well, Prince Orange"
1405,BETHLEHEM,"Plushikins at once asked the Princess flea to marry him, and the minute"
1406,BETHLEHEM,"the flea said “Yes,” the Princess reappeared.  She and the Prince were"
1407,BETHLEHEM,married next morning; and all the cats went to the steam laundry and were
1408,BETHLEHEM,washed and bleached and had their tails crimped and their whiskers
1409,BETHLEHEM,"starched; and they danced at the wedding, and everybody lived happily"
1410,BETHLEHEM,ever after.
1411,BETHLEHEM,
1412,BETHLEHEM,
1413,BETHLEHEM,
1414,BETHLEHEM,The Discontented Daffodils.
1415,BETHLEHEM,
1416,BETHLEHEM,
1417,BETHLEHEM,"THEY had the very loveliest home you can imagine, with beautiful soft"
1418,BETHLEHEM,"moss and grass to grow in, trees to form a cosy shelter from the wind,"
1419,BETHLEHEM,and a dear little babbling stream to water them.
1420,BETHLEHEM,
1421,BETHLEHEM,"There were lots of daffodils in this pretty place, and nobody ever"
1422,BETHLEHEM,discovered the nook to gather them.  They rejoiced in the spring sunshine
1423,BETHLEHEM,"and gentle breezes, the greeting of the birds, and the musical chatter of"
1424,BETHLEHEM,the brook; then when their brief visit to the upper world was over they
1425,BETHLEHEM,nestled happily down in their warm mossy beds and slept till April came
1426,BETHLEHEM,again to wake them.
1427,BETHLEHEM,
1428,BETHLEHEM,A little apart from the rest were four daffodils growing at the root of a
1429,BETHLEHEM,"gnarled oak tree, and one fine sunshiny morning three of them took it"
1430,BETHLEHEM,"into their silly little heads that they were dull, the place was dull,"
1431,BETHLEHEM,"the other daffodils were dull, and they wanted a change."
1432,BETHLEHEM,
1433,BETHLEHEM,"It was mainly the fault of the cuckoo, for he was a grumbling,"
1434,BETHLEHEM,mischief-making bird and used to spend a good deal of time talking to the
1435,BETHLEHEM,daffodils.  This particular spring he had taken up his abode in the oak
1436,BETHLEHEM,"tree, and was fond of talking of all the grand things he had seen, and a"
1437,BETHLEHEM,"great many he had not seen, for the cuckoo is a bird of fine imagination;"
1438,BETHLEHEM,"and at last, as I have already said, three of the daffodils made up their"
1439,BETHLEHEM,"minds that to be a flower and live in a wood was a very dreadful thing,"
1440,BETHLEHEM,and not to be put up with any longer.
1441,BETHLEHEM,
1442,BETHLEHEM,Now the cuckoo had told many strange tales about creatures with two legs
1443,BETHLEHEM,"and beautiful coloured leaves which grew in an odd way, and feathers only"
1444,BETHLEHEM,"on their heads.  They could not fly, but they could run about from place"
1445,BETHLEHEM,"to place, and dance and sing; and at last the daffodils decided that they"
1446,BETHLEHEM,"wished to be like these curious creatures, which the cuckoo called"
1447,BETHLEHEM,_girls_.
1448,BETHLEHEM,
1449,BETHLEHEM,Then there were sad times in that sweet little nook under the oak tree.
1450,BETHLEHEM,
1451,BETHLEHEM,The naughty daffodils cried and quarrelled and bewailed their lot all day
1452,BETHLEHEM,"long, till they made themselves and everybody else extremely wretched."
1453,BETHLEHEM,"Their little sister shook her head at them, and scolded and said that for"
1454,BETHLEHEM,"her part she was not meant to have legs; but it was all no use, the"
1455,BETHLEHEM,daffodils would not be quiet.
1456,BETHLEHEM,
1457,BETHLEHEM,One day the Fairy Visitor who looked after the flowers in that part heard
1458,BETHLEHEM,"the silly blossoms crying, and stopped to ask what was the matter.  When"
1459,BETHLEHEM,she heard the story she told them they were very foolish and
1460,BETHLEHEM,"discontented, and that the cuckoo was a most mischievous bird and liked"
1461,BETHLEHEM,to get people into trouble; but the daffodils would not listen.  So
1462,BETHLEHEM,knowing there is nothing so likely to cure silly flower as to give them
1463,BETHLEHEM,"their own silly way, she said—“Very well, my dears, you want to be girls,"
1464,BETHLEHEM,and girls you shall be.”
1465,BETHLEHEM,
1466,BETHLEHEM,With that she waved her wand over the three daffodils and in a twinkle
1467,BETHLEHEM,they were gone; in their places stood three tall pretty maidens dressed
1468,BETHLEHEM,in soft yellow silk frocks with green stockings and shoes.  For a minute
1469,BETHLEHEM,"they were too much astonished to speak, then clapping their hands they"
1470,BETHLEHEM,"laughed and skipped for joy, and wanted to kiss the old fairy because"
1471,BETHLEHEM,they were so pleased at getting their own way; but the fairy would not
1472,BETHLEHEM,"look at them, and stooped over the little flower now growing all alone,"
1473,BETHLEHEM,saying kindly:—
1474,BETHLEHEM,
1475,BETHLEHEM,"“Well, little one, don’t you want to be a pretty maiden, too?”"
1476,BETHLEHEM,
1477,BETHLEHEM,But the daffodil shook her head with great determination:—
1478,BETHLEHEM,
1479,BETHLEHEM,“I don’t want legs and I won’t have legs.  I was meant to be a flower and
1480,BETHLEHEM,"a flower I will be, but if you could keep that meddling, chattering"
1481,BETHLEHEM,cuckoo away from this tree for a time I should be much obliged.”
1482,BETHLEHEM,
1483,BETHLEHEM,And the fairy laughed and promised.
1484,BETHLEHEM,
1485,BETHLEHEM,Meanwhile the three pretty maidens had set of hand in hand to seek their
1486,BETHLEHEM,fortunes.
1487,BETHLEHEM,
1488,BETHLEHEM,They went singing and dancing over the meadows in the soft afternoon
1489,BETHLEHEM,"sunshine, and thought how wise and clever they were to be girls instead"
1490,BETHLEHEM,of little unnoticed flowers growing in a wood.
1491,BETHLEHEM,
1492,BETHLEHEM,Presently they came to a house and stopped to ask whether they could have
1493,BETHLEHEM,"a lodging for the night.  There was no difficulty about it, for that is a"
1494,BETHLEHEM,happy country where there is no money and everything belongs to
1495,BETHLEHEM,"everybody, so the people of the house—an old man and woman—were delighted"
1496,BETHLEHEM,"to see the beautiful maidens and made them heartily welcome, and the"
1497,BETHLEHEM,daffodils went to bed that night very happy and quite content with the
1498,BETHLEHEM,"result of their experiment.  When they came to undress, however, they"
1499,BETHLEHEM,received a severe shock.
1500,BETHLEHEM,
1501,BETHLEHEM,"They were girls, real proper girls, they could chatter and eat and sleep,"
1502,BETHLEHEM,for the fairy was not one to do things by halves; but when they pulled
1503,BETHLEHEM,"off the dainty green shoes and stockings, they discovered that although"
1504,BETHLEHEM,"they had the prettiest little legs and feet and toes in the world, they"
1505,BETHLEHEM,"were quite green, the colour of daffodil leaves."
1506,BETHLEHEM,
1507,BETHLEHEM,"There wasn’t anything said about a “dear, darling, kind old fairy” then,"
1508,BETHLEHEM,I can assure you.
1509,BETHLEHEM,
1510,BETHLEHEM,The first daffodil said she was a wicked old witch.  The second said she
1511,BETHLEHEM,was a horrible old woman; and the third said she knew the fairy meant to
1512,BETHLEHEM,"pay them out, and she would like to scratch her.  Then they all set to"
1513,BETHLEHEM,"work arguing and quarrelling and crying like silly babies, when suddenly"
1514,BETHLEHEM,"a familiar “Cuck-oo!” sounded in their ears, and they saw our old"
1515,BETHLEHEM,acquaintance perched on the window sill.
1516,BETHLEHEM,
1517,BETHLEHEM,"He looked at the six little green feet, and his eyes twinkled; but before"
1518,BETHLEHEM,"he could speak the three angry maidens all began scolding him at once,"
1519,BETHLEHEM,for they were delighted to have somebody fresh to find fault with.
1520,BETHLEHEM,
1521,BETHLEHEM,"The cuckoo, being in some respects a philosopher, did not attempt to"
1522,BETHLEHEM,"interrupt, but when they were quite exhausted he said he really could not"
1523,BETHLEHEM,see any reason for their distress.  No one would ever wish to see their
1524,BETHLEHEM,"feet, and they could always wear stockings.  He added that he had great"
1525,BETHLEHEM,"news, and had come on purpose to bring it."
1526,BETHLEHEM,
1527,BETHLEHEM,"“The King of Silverland,” he said, “is coming with all his court to hold"
1528,BETHLEHEM,high revel close to this place and celebrate the coming of age of his
1529,BETHLEHEM,three sons.  These princes were all born at once; and the king has
1530,BETHLEHEM,decided to divide his kingdom into three equal parts and leave his sons
1531,BETHLEHEM,to rule while he retires to his country place to study science.  Now
1532,BETHLEHEM,"these Silver princes desire to marry three princesses, sisters born at"
1533,BETHLEHEM,"once like themselves; but they are very hard to find, and the king is"
1534,BETHLEHEM,advertising everywhere for triplets.  When I heard this I set off at once
1535,BETHLEHEM,to tell you.”
1536,BETHLEHEM,
1537,BETHLEHEM,The three maidens were so much interested and excited that they forgot
1538,BETHLEHEM,their troubles and began to sing.
1539,BETHLEHEM,
1540,BETHLEHEM,"The cuckoo was pleased with his success, but told them they must go to"
1541,BETHLEHEM,"bed and to sleep, and he would fetch them in the morning to show them the"
1542,BETHLEHEM,way to the King of Silverland’s court.
1543,BETHLEHEM,
1544,BETHLEHEM,"Next morning, although he arrived quite early, the maidens were up and"
1545,BETHLEHEM,"ready for him, looking very pretty in their yellow frocks.  The kind"
1546,BETHLEHEM,people of the house were quite sorry to part with their guests and begged
1547,BETHLEHEM,"them to come again, and the daffodil maidens set off in high spirits,"
1548,BETHLEHEM,following the cuckoo as he flew slowly ahead across the sunlit meadows.
1549,BETHLEHEM,About noon they came in sight of the king’s court.  The gorgeous tents
1550,BETHLEHEM,were of cloth of silver fastened with silver ropes; fountains were
1551,BETHLEHEM,"playing in the open spaces, and flags flying everywhere.  The daffodils"
1552,BETHLEHEM,"attracted a great deal of attention as they made their way, blushing and"
1553,BETHLEHEM,"a little frightened, through the crowds of soldiers, court ladies and"
1554,BETHLEHEM,attendants.  At the door of the largest and most gorgeous tent stood
1555,BETHLEHEM,three beautiful princes dressed in silver.
1556,BETHLEHEM,
1557,BETHLEHEM,"When they saw the maidens approaching, hand in hand, they gave a cry of"
1558,BETHLEHEM,joy and ran forward to greet them.
1559,BETHLEHEM,
1560,BETHLEHEM,"“Dear beautiful princesses,” they cried, “welcome to our court!  May we"
1561,BETHLEHEM,ask your names and the country you come from?”
1562,BETHLEHEM,
1563,BETHLEHEM,"The cuckoo, perched on a tent-pole hard by, answered for them.  “These"
1564,BETHLEHEM,"are the Princesses Daffodil, daughters of the great King of Goldenland."
1565,BETHLEHEM,They have come very many days’ journey to be present at your revels.”
1566,BETHLEHEM,
1567,BETHLEHEM,Think of the cuckoo telling such a dreadful story and those naughty
1568,BETHLEHEM,daffodils not contradicting him!
1569,BETHLEHEM,
1570,BETHLEHEM,When the princes heard the cuckoo’s words they were almost beside
1571,BETHLEHEM,"themselves with joy, for, as it happened, there was a real King of"
1572,BETHLEHEM,"Goldenland (but the cuckoo did not know it), and he had three daughters"
1573,BETHLEHEM,of the same age whom the Silver princes were anxious to see.  They
1574,BETHLEHEM,"dropped on one knee, kissed the maidens’ hands very prettily, and then"
1575,BETHLEHEM,"led them, blushing and delighted, into the royal tent."
1576,BETHLEHEM,
1577,BETHLEHEM,"The king was out, but the queen received the daffodils very graciously."
1578,BETHLEHEM,
1579,BETHLEHEM,"“Triplet,” she said significantly, and it was the princes’ turn to blush."
1580,BETHLEHEM,
1581,BETHLEHEM,"Then the young people visited all the beautiful tents, and the great"
1582,BETHLEHEM,"ballroom where there was to be a ball that night, and the princes"
1583,BETHLEHEM,whispered to the maidens that they would dance with no one else.  When
1584,BETHLEHEM,they had tasted the cowslip wine from the fountains and eaten lots of
1585,BETHLEHEM,wonderful sweets the daffodils declared they were quite tired; so the
1586,BETHLEHEM,"princes put them into hammocks with little monkeys to swing them, and the"
1587,BETHLEHEM,happy hours wore on until the evening.
1588,BETHLEHEM,
1589,BETHLEHEM,"The maidens had had a beautiful tent assigned to them by the queen, and"
1590,BETHLEHEM,they found lovely dresses of cloth of gold with shoes and stockings to
1591,BETHLEHEM,"match, all ready for them.  They looked so beautiful when they were"
1592,BETHLEHEM,dressed that the colour of their feet did not seem to matter at all.
1593,BETHLEHEM,
1594,BETHLEHEM,"All that night they danced with the princes, and everyone was charmed"
1595,BETHLEHEM,"with their beauty and grace, especially the king, who had not received a"
1596,BETHLEHEM,single answer to his advertisement.  At the great banquet which followed
1597,BETHLEHEM,the ball the betrothal of the Silver princes to the Golden princesses was
1598,BETHLEHEM,"solemnly announced, and their health drunk amid great rejoicing."
1599,BETHLEHEM,
1600,BETHLEHEM,"The dawn was red in the east before the festivities were over, and the"
1601,BETHLEHEM,"daffodils went to bed happier than they had ever been before, happier"
1602,BETHLEHEM,than they ever would be again.  A new and awful trouble of which they had
1603,BETHLEHEM,never dreamt was about to befall them.
1604,BETHLEHEM,
1605,BETHLEHEM,When the princes came to meet their betrothed next morning the maidens
1606,BETHLEHEM,"noticed that, although very affectionate, they were downcast and somewhat"
1607,BETHLEHEM,"silent.  At last, after a great deal of questioning, the reason came out."
1608,BETHLEHEM,"The king and queen had both had exactly the same curious dream, and this"
1609,BETHLEHEM,strange occurrence had upset their majesties very much.  They both dreamt
1610,BETHLEHEM,"that one of the princesses, as they believed them to be, had six toes on"
1611,BETHLEHEM,each foot; and as no monstrosity could ever share the throne of
1612,BETHLEHEM,Silverland they demanded to see the princesses’ little feet with their
1613,BETHLEHEM,"own eyes, so as to be quite sure they all had only the right number of"
1614,BETHLEHEM,toes.
1615,BETHLEHEM,
1616,BETHLEHEM,"When the princes with many blushes broke this news to their lady-loves,"
1617,BETHLEHEM,they each gave a short loud scream and fainted.
1618,BETHLEHEM,
1619,BETHLEHEM,"Their lovers, of course, put this down to extreme modesty, and were much"
1620,BETHLEHEM,affected by such proper conduct; but when they succeeded in restoring
1621,BETHLEHEM,them to consciousness they were not a little disturbed to find that the
1622,BETHLEHEM,maidens positively refused to show their feet.
1623,BETHLEHEM,
1624,BETHLEHEM,Imagine the grief of the poor princes!  The king had said quite
1625,BETHLEHEM,"positively that not one of the princes should marry till he, the queen,"
1626,BETHLEHEM,"and the councillors of the kingdom, had seen the bride’s feet; and the"
1627,BETHLEHEM,maidens now declared that they would never never show them.
1628,BETHLEHEM,
1629,BETHLEHEM,Matters were in this awkward state when the cuckoo appeared on the scene.
1630,BETHLEHEM,"He had as usual contrived to find out what was going on, and now"
1631,BETHLEHEM,"announced that he had a private message for the Golden princesses, if"
1632,BETHLEHEM,they would take him to their tent.
1633,BETHLEHEM,
1634,BETHLEHEM,"When they were alone the daffodils began to cry their eyes out, and the"
1635,BETHLEHEM,cuckoo to try and comfort them.
1636,BETHLEHEM,
1637,BETHLEHEM,"“Green feet,” he said, “are very uncommon and would no doubt be welcomed"
1638,BETHLEHEM,as a great rarity.”
1639,BETHLEHEM,
1640,BETHLEHEM,But the maidens sobbed on.
1641,BETHLEHEM,
1642,BETHLEHEM,“The princes love you so much they will think your little feet the most
1643,BETHLEHEM,beautiful colour in the world.”
1644,BETHLEHEM,
1645,BETHLEHEM,But they would not listen.
1646,BETHLEHEM,
1647,BETHLEHEM,"“I heard the king and queen say that green was their favourite colour,”"
1648,BETHLEHEM,he remarked next.
1649,BETHLEHEM,
1650,BETHLEHEM,"This was pure invention on the cuckoo’s part, but the daffodils were"
1651,BETHLEHEM,"somewhat cheered, and after a great deal of talking the cuckoo persuaded"
1652,BETHLEHEM,"them to give in and consent to show their feet, as they could not"
1653,BETHLEHEM,"possibly marry the princes without.  Besides, perhaps when the king found"
1654,BETHLEHEM,their toes were all right he would think the colour rather ornamental
1655,BETHLEHEM,than otherwise.  So the princes were told to their great joy that the
1656,BETHLEHEM,"princesses had consented to show their feet; and the king and queen, on"
1657,BETHLEHEM,"being informed, summoned a Cabinet Council for the next morning so that"
1658,BETHLEHEM,their ministers might be present at the counting of the princesses’ toes.
1659,BETHLEHEM,
1660,BETHLEHEM,Meantime the real Goldenland princesses had arrived near the camp; but as
1661,BETHLEHEM,they and their suite were very tired they resolved not to visit the
1662,BETHLEHEM,"Silver king till the next day, and commanded that no one should mention"
1663,BETHLEHEM,their arrival.
1664,BETHLEHEM,
1665,BETHLEHEM,"That night the daffodils never slept, for fear once more took possession"
1666,BETHLEHEM,"of them.  They scrubbed their feet, but the fairy’s dye would not come"
1667,BETHLEHEM,"off; then they scraped them, but that hurt very much and did no good."
1668,BETHLEHEM,"Finally they chalked them, but that was no use at all; so they had to"
1669,BETHLEHEM,"give it up in despair, and hope for the best."
1670,BETHLEHEM,
1671,BETHLEHEM,Next morning two of the court ushers came to escort them to the Cabinet
1672,BETHLEHEM,"Council.  Poor daffodils!  Their eyes were red with weeping, and they"
1673,BETHLEHEM,could scarcely stand for terror when they entered the tent where the
1674,BETHLEHEM,examination was to take place.
1675,BETHLEHEM,
1676,BETHLEHEM,"In the middle on a raised dais sat the king and queen, on their right"
1677,BETHLEHEM,"stood the three princes, on their left the councillors in their robes of"
1678,BETHLEHEM,"state.  Three chairs were placed for the maidens, and they were politely"
1679,BETHLEHEM,but firmly requested to take off their shoes and stockings.
1680,BETHLEHEM,
1681,BETHLEHEM,Blushing crimson the daffodils slowly and unwillingly took off their
1682,BETHLEHEM,"shoes.  Then they cried a little and said they really truly couldn’t, but"
1683,BETHLEHEM,"it was no use, and the stockings had to follow, and six little green feet"
1684,BETHLEHEM,were exposed to view.
1685,BETHLEHEM,
1686,BETHLEHEM,"“They wear two pairs, I see,” said the queen, who was a little"
1687,BETHLEHEM,"short-sighted.  “Very sensible, I’m sure, in this damp place.  Take off"
1688,BETHLEHEM,"the other pair, my dears.”"
1689,BETHLEHEM,
1690,BETHLEHEM,But the daffodils only hung their heads and wept.
1691,BETHLEHEM,
1692,BETHLEHEM,"Then one of the councillors cried out, in a horrified tone—“Their feet"
1693,BETHLEHEM,are green!  They are monstrosities!” and at that very moment heralds were
1694,BETHLEHEM,heard outside announcing the arrival of the Princesses of Goldenland.
1695,BETHLEHEM,
1696,BETHLEHEM,"Now the king was a shrewd old gentleman, and the true state of affairs"
1697,BETHLEHEM,"suddenly flashed upon him.  “They are impostors!” he cried, rising to his"
1698,BETHLEHEM,"feet, “turn the deceitful minxes out.”"
1699,BETHLEHEM,
1700,BETHLEHEM,At that the maidens rose and fled.  They never stopped for shoes or
1701,BETHLEHEM,"stockings, but ran like hunted hares out of the tent across the fields;"
1702,BETHLEHEM,and when the people saw their little green feet a great shout of laughter
1703,BETHLEHEM,"went up, in which the king and the princes joined.  As for the daffodils,"
1704,BETHLEHEM,"they ran and ran and ran, not daring even to look behind them, till they"
1705,BETHLEHEM,suddenly stopped for want of breath; and where do you think they were?
1706,BETHLEHEM,Why in their old home under the oak tree.  Most of the daffodils had gone
1707,BETHLEHEM,"to sleep, but a few were left, and among them their little sister.  At"
1708,BETHLEHEM,her side stood the fairy.
1709,BETHLEHEM,
1710,BETHLEHEM,"“Well, my dears, do you like being girls?” and there was a twinkle in her"
1711,BETHLEHEM,eye as she spoke.
1712,BETHLEHEM,
1713,BETHLEHEM,"But the daffodils were sobbing too bitterly to answer, and the fairy had"
1714,BETHLEHEM,a kind heart and did not press the question.  “Would you be content to be
1715,BETHLEHEM,"daffodils again?” she asked, and smiled at them sweetly."
1716,BETHLEHEM,
1717,BETHLEHEM,"They murmured a thankful “Yes”; the fairy waved her wand, and in a trice"
1718,BETHLEHEM,"the maidens were gone and there were three more flowers, very pale faded"
1719,BETHLEHEM,"ones, growing under the gnarled oak tree.  Poor discontented daffodils!"
1720,BETHLEHEM,They had to pay a heavy price for their folly.
1721,BETHLEHEM,
1722,BETHLEHEM,"The cuckoo came back time after time, and never wearied of teasing them;"
1723,BETHLEHEM,and their little sister made many very true but disagreeable remarks on
1724,BETHLEHEM,the extreme silliness of being discontented with one’s surroundings.
1725,BETHLEHEM,
1726,BETHLEHEM,Perhaps by next spring things may be better; but of this you may be quite
1727,BETHLEHEM,"sure, no amount of cuckoos will ever persuade the flowers in that nook to"
1728,BETHLEHEM,be anything but what nature intended them to be—sweet little daffodils.

1731,BETHLEHEM,
1732,BETHLEHEM,The Fairy Fluffikins
1733,BETHLEHEM,
1734,BETHLEHEM,
1735,BETHLEHEM,THE Fairy Fluffikins lived in a warm woolly nest in a hole down an old
1736,BETHLEHEM,"oak tree.  She was the sweetest, funniest little fairy you ever saw.  She"
1737,BETHLEHEM,"wore a little, soft, fluffy brown dress, and on her head a little red"
1738,BETHLEHEM,"woolly cap; she had soft red hair and the brightest, naughtiest,"
1739,BETHLEHEM,"merriest, sharpest brown eyes imaginable."
1740,BETHLEHEM,
1741,BETHLEHEM,What a life she led the animals!  Fairy Fluffikins was a sad tease; she
1742,BETHLEHEM,would creep into the nests where the fat baby dormice were asleep in bed
1743,BETHLEHEM,while Mamma dormouse nodded over her knitting and Papa smoked his little
1744,BETHLEHEM,acorn pipe; and she would tickle the babies till they screamed with
1745,BETHLEHEM,"laughter and nearly rolled out of bed, and Mamma scolded, and Papa said"
1746,BETHLEHEM,"in a gruff voice—“What a plague you are, you little dors; go to sleep"
1747,BETHLEHEM,this minute or I will fetch my big stick.”
1748,BETHLEHEM,
1749,BETHLEHEM,"And then the babies would shake, for they were afraid of the big stick;"
1750,BETHLEHEM,and naughty Fairy Fluffikins would dance off to find some fresh piece of
1751,BETHLEHEM,mischief.
1752,BETHLEHEM,
1753,BETHLEHEM,One night she had fine fun.  She found a little dead mouse in a field;
1754,BETHLEHEM,"and at first she was sorry for the mouse, and thought she would bury it"
1755,BETHLEHEM,and plant a daisy on its grave; but then an idea struck her.  She hunted
1756,BETHLEHEM,"about till she found a piece of long, strong grass, and then she took the"
1757,BETHLEHEM,"little mouse, tied the piece of grass round its tail, and ran away with"
1758,BETHLEHEM,it to the big tree where the Ancient Owl lived.  There was a little hole
1759,BETHLEHEM,"at the bottom of the tree and into it Fairy Fluffikins crept, leaving the"
1760,BETHLEHEM,mouse outside in the moonlight.  Presently she heard a gruff voice in the
1761,BETHLEHEM,tree saying—
1762,BETHLEHEM,
1763,BETHLEHEM,"“I smell mouse, I smell mouse.”  Then there was a swoop of wings, and"
1764,BETHLEHEM,Fairy Fluffikins promptly drew the mouse into the little hole and stuffed
1765,BETHLEHEM,its tail into her mouth so that she might not be heard laughing; and the
1766,BETHLEHEM,gruff voice said angrily—
1767,BETHLEHEM,
1768,BETHLEHEM,"“Where’s that mouse gone?  I smelt mouse, I know I smelt mouse!”"
1769,BETHLEHEM,
1770,BETHLEHEM,"She grew tired of this game after a few times, so she left the mouse in"
1771,BETHLEHEM,the hole and crept away to a new one.  She really was a naughty fairy.
1772,BETHLEHEM,She blew on the buttercups so that they thought the morning breeze had
1773,BETHLEHEM,"come to wake them up, and opened their cups in a great hurry.  She buzzed"
1774,BETHLEHEM,"outside the clover and made it talk in its sleep, so that it said in a"
1775,BETHLEHEM,"cross, sleepy voice—“Go away, you stupid busy bee, and don’t wake me up"
1776,BETHLEHEM,in the middle of the night.”
1777,BETHLEHEM,
1778,BETHLEHEM,She pulled the tail of the nightingale who was singing to his lady-love
1779,BETHLEHEM,"in the hawthorn bush, and he lost his place in his song and nearly"
1780,BETHLEHEM,tumbled over backwards into the garden.  Then to her joy she met an
1781,BETHLEHEM,"elderly, domestic puss taking an evening walk with a view to field-mice."
1782,BETHLEHEM,
1783,BETHLEHEM,Here was sport.  Fluffikins hid in the grass and squeaked; and when the
1784,BETHLEHEM,elderly cat came tearing up she pulled his whiskers and flew away (I
1785,BETHLEHEM,"forgot to tell you that she had little, soft wings), and the elderly cat"
1786,BETHLEHEM,jumped and said—
1787,BETHLEHEM,
1788,BETHLEHEM,“Mouse-traps and mince-meat!  Fancy a cat of my age and experience taking
1789,BETHLEHEM,a bat for a mouse!  But by my claws I heard a mouse’s squeak.”
1790,BETHLEHEM,
1791,BETHLEHEM,"Fairy Fluffikins often met the poor elderly cat, and always led him some"
1792,BETHLEHEM,"dreadful dance, now and then taking a ride on his back into the bargain,"
1793,BETHLEHEM,till he thought he must have got the nightmare.
1794,BETHLEHEM,
1795,BETHLEHEM,One day Fairy Fluffikins was well paid out for some of her naughtiness.
1796,BETHLEHEM,She was flying away from a tree where she had just wrapped a sleeping
1797,BETHLEHEM,"bat’s head up in a large cobweb, when she heard the sweep of wings, felt"
1798,BETHLEHEM,a sharp nip—and in less time than it takes to tell found herself in the
1799,BETHLEHEM,nest of the Ancient Owl.
1800,BETHLEHEM,
1801,BETHLEHEM,"“My wig!” said the Ancient Owl, much surprised, “I thought you were a"
1802,BETHLEHEM,bat.”  And he called his wife and three children to look.
1803,BETHLEHEM,
1804,BETHLEHEM,Now when Fairy Fluffikins saw five pairs of large round eyes blinking and
1805,BETHLEHEM,"staring at her she lost her head and cried out—“Please, please, Mr"
1806,BETHLEHEM,"Ancient Owl, don’t be angry with me and I will never play tricks with"
1807,BETHLEHEM,"mice any more,” and so told the Ancient Owl what he had never even"
1808,BETHLEHEM,suspected before.
1809,BETHLEHEM,
1810,BETHLEHEM,Then the Ancient Owl was MOST DREADFULLY ANGRY and read Fairy Fluffikins
1811,BETHLEHEM,a long sermon about the wickedness of deceiving Ancient Owls.  The sermon
1812,BETHLEHEM,took two hours and a half; and when it was over all the owls hooted at
1813,BETHLEHEM,her and pecked her; and Fairy Fluffikins was very glad indeed when at
1814,BETHLEHEM,last Mrs Ancient Owl gave her a push and said—
1815,BETHLEHEM,
1816,BETHLEHEM,"“Go along, you impertinent brown minx,” and she was able to go out into"
1817,BETHLEHEM,the night.
1818,BETHLEHEM,
1819,BETHLEHEM,Even this sad adventure did not cure Fairy Fluffikins of getting into
1820,BETHLEHEM,"mischief—although she never teased the owls any more, you may be sure of"
1821,BETHLEHEM,that—she took to tormenting the squirrels instead.  She used to find
1822,BETHLEHEM,their stores of nuts and carry them away and fill the holes with pebbles;
1823,BETHLEHEM,"and this, when you are a hard-working squirrel with a large family to"
1824,BETHLEHEM,"support, is very trying to the temper.  Then she would tie acorns to"
1825,BETHLEHEM,"their tails; and she would clap her hands to frighten them, and pull the"
1826,BETHLEHEM,baby-squirrels’ ears; till at last they offered a reward to anyone who
1827,BETHLEHEM,could catch Fairy Fluffikins and bring her to be punished.
1828,BETHLEHEM,
1829,BETHLEHEM,"No one caught Fairy Fluffikins; but she caught herself, as you shall"
1830,BETHLEHEM,hear.
1831,BETHLEHEM,
1832,BETHLEHEM,"She was poking about round a haystack one night, trying to find something"
1833,BETHLEHEM,"naughty to do, when she came upon a sweet little house with pretty wire"
1834,BETHLEHEM,"walls and a wooden door standing invitingly open.  In hopped Fluffikins,"
1835,BETHLEHEM,thinking she was going to have some new kind of fun.  There was a little
1836,BETHLEHEM,"white thing dangling from the roof, and she laid hold of it.  Immediately"
1837,BETHLEHEM,there was a bang; the wooden door slammed; and Fluffikins was caught.
1838,BETHLEHEM,
1839,BETHLEHEM,"How she cried and stamped and pushed at the door, and promised to be a"
1840,BETHLEHEM,good fairy and a great many other things!  But all to no purpose: the
1841,BETHLEHEM,"door was tight shut, and Fluffikins was not like some fortunate fairies"
1842,BETHLEHEM,who can get out of anywhere.
1843,BETHLEHEM,
1844,BETHLEHEM,"There she remained, and in the morning one of the labourers found her,"
1845,BETHLEHEM,"and, thinking she was some kind of dormouse, he carried her home to his"
1846,BETHLEHEM,little girl; and if you call on Mary Ann Smith you will see Fairy
1847,BETHLEHEM,Fluffikins there still in a little cage.  They give her nuts and cheese
1848,BETHLEHEM,"and bread, and all the things she doesn’t like, and there is no one to"
1849,BETHLEHEM,tease and no mischief to get into; so if there is a miserable little
1850,BETHLEHEM,"Fairy anywhere it is Fairy Fluffikins, and I’m not sure it doesn’t serve"
1851,BETHLEHEM,her quite right.
1852,BETHLEHEM,

1854,BETHLEHEM,
1855,BETHLEHEM,The Story of the Tinkle-Tinkle.
1856,BETHLEHEM,
1857,BETHLEHEM,
1858,BETHLEHEM,Once upon a time there lived a Tinkle-Tinkle.  I cannot tell you what he
1859,BETHLEHEM,"was like, because no man knows, not even the Tinkle-Tinkle himself."
1860,BETHLEHEM,"Sometimes he lived on the ground, sometimes in a tree, sometimes in the"
1861,BETHLEHEM,"water, sometimes in a cave; and I can’t tell you what he lived on, for no"
1862,BETHLEHEM,"man knows, not even the Tinkle-Tinkle himself."
1863,BETHLEHEM,
1864,BETHLEHEM,"One day the Tinkle-Tinkle was going through a wood, when he heard a"
1865,BETHLEHEM,"piteous weeping.  He stopped, for he was a kindly Tinkle-Tinkle, and"
1866,BETHLEHEM,found two small dormice sobbing under a tree because they had been
1867,BETHLEHEM,cruelly deserted by their parents.  He wiped their eyes tenderly and took
1868,BETHLEHEM,"them to his cave home; but I cannot tell you how he went, for no man"
1869,BETHLEHEM,"knows, not even the Tinkle-Tinkle.  However, when he got there he put the"
1870,BETHLEHEM,"dormice to bed in his grandmother’s boots, for which he had never found"
1871,BETHLEHEM,"any use before, and fed them on periwinkles and tea, and was very kind to"
1872,BETHLEHEM,"them; and when they grew older he bought them caps and aprons, and they"
1873,BETHLEHEM,became the Tinkle-Tinkle’s housemaid and parlourmaid.
1874,BETHLEHEM,
1875,BETHLEHEM,Now I must tell you that it was a great grief to the Tinkle-Tinkle not to
1876,BETHLEHEM,"know what he was, or how he lived, or where he was going to; and it often"
1877,BETHLEHEM,"made him depressed, but he always concealed it from the dormice,"
1878,BETHLEHEM,appearing a most cheerful and contented creature.
1879,BETHLEHEM,
1880,BETHLEHEM,One day he found a poor green bird lying on the ground with its leg
1881,BETHLEHEM,broken.  Fortunately Tinkle-Tinkle had his grandmother’s black silk
1882,BETHLEHEM,reticule with him which had never been of any service to him before.  He
1883,BETHLEHEM,gently placed the green bird in the bottom and carried it to the cave.
1884,BETHLEHEM,
1885,BETHLEHEM,The dormice laid the poor sufferer on a soft bed and put the broken leg
1886,BETHLEHEM,up carefully in plaster of Paris; and they nursed the green bird with the
1887,BETHLEHEM,greatest attention so that it was soon well enough to hop about on
1888,BETHLEHEM,crutches; and it sang so beautifully that all the inhabitants round gave
1889,BETHLEHEM,"it money, and its fame spread abroad; but it was so tenderly attached to"
1890,BETHLEHEM,the Tinkle-Tinkle and the dormice that it would not leave them.
1891,BETHLEHEM,
1892,BETHLEHEM,Now it happened on a certain evening that the Tinkle-Tinkle was
1893,BETHLEHEM,"travelling over the sea, when suddenly in the depths he caught sight of a"
1894,BETHLEHEM,"most beautiful Creature.  It was all sorts of colours—white, rosy pink,"
1895,BETHLEHEM,"and deep crimson, and pale blue fading into white and gold.  It had no"
1896,BETHLEHEM,face but a bright light; and it had quantities of beautiful iridescent
1897,BETHLEHEM,"wings, like the rainbow; and the most lovely voice you ever heard, like"
1898,BETHLEHEM,the sighing of the waves in the hollow of the sea.
1899,BETHLEHEM,
1900,BETHLEHEM,"The Tinkle-Tinkle was so astonished and entranced that he stopped, and"
1901,BETHLEHEM,"the beautiful Creature cried out to him, and its voice made Tinkle-Tinkle"
1902,BETHLEHEM,"remember a dream he had once had of sunshine, and forest trees, and the"
1903,BETHLEHEM,"song of birds; and the Creature said, “Ah, Tinkle-Tinkle! you are lonely"
1904,BETHLEHEM,"and perplexed and sad, and you do not know whence you came nor why you"
1905,BETHLEHEM,"are here; but the dormice know and the green bird knows, and I know, and"
1906,BETHLEHEM,"we are glad for your being.  Go on, Tinkle-Tinkle, and do not sorrow, for"
1907,BETHLEHEM,"some day you shall come back to me, and I will wrap you in my wings and"
1908,BETHLEHEM,"take you where you belong, and then you will understand.”"
1909,BETHLEHEM,
1910,BETHLEHEM,When the Tinkle-Tinkle heard this he was glad with a new strange
1911,BETHLEHEM,"gladness, and he went back to his cave; but not alone, for the spirit of"
1912,BETHLEHEM,hope went with him.
1913,BETHLEHEM,
1914,BETHLEHEM,"The Tinkle-Tinkle had one gift—he could sing—how, no man knew, not even"
1915,BETHLEHEM,the Tinkle-Tinkle himself; and this is how he discovered his gift.
1916,BETHLEHEM,
1917,BETHLEHEM,"One day in a secluded spot in the forest he found a dying stag, and the"
1918,BETHLEHEM,Tinkle-Tinkle was moved with great compassion and yet could do nothing.
1919,BETHLEHEM,
1920,BETHLEHEM,The great stag’s head drooped lower and lower till even the sun melted in
1921,BETHLEHEM,"a mist of pity, and the trees sighed, and the breezes hushed their"
1922,BETHLEHEM,"voices.  Then suddenly the Tinkle-Tinkle crept close and began to sing,"
1923,BETHLEHEM,"why or how he knew not.  As he sang, the birds and the stream were"
1924,BETHLEHEM,"silenced and the breezes ceased, and the great stag’s breathing grew less"
1925,BETHLEHEM,"and less laboured, and his eyes brightened, and presently he rose slowly"
1926,BETHLEHEM,"to his feet and paced away to join the rest of the herd, and the"
1927,BETHLEHEM,Tinkle-Tinkle went with him.
1928,BETHLEHEM,
1929,BETHLEHEM,"When the stag’s companions heard the story, they wept for all that had"
1930,BETHLEHEM,"befallen their leader, but rejoiced also and blessed the Tinkle-Tinkle;"
1931,BETHLEHEM,"and he sang once more for them, and the Star-spirits leaned out of their"
1932,BETHLEHEM,"bright little windows to listen, and the night was glad."
1933,BETHLEHEM,
1934,BETHLEHEM,"Many were the adventures of the Tinkle-Tinkle, and countless the"
1935,BETHLEHEM,"creatures he cheered and helped, yet he never fancied himself any use or"
1936,BETHLEHEM,knew why he was in the world.  He brought home a poor old crab without a
1937,BETHLEHEM,"claw, and the green bird and the dormice found a hook and screwed it in,"
1938,BETHLEHEM,and the poor old crab used to carry parcels for the neighbours; but he
1939,BETHLEHEM,still lived with the Tinkle-Tinkle.
1940,BETHLEHEM,
1941,BETHLEHEM,Another time it was a snail with a broken shell; for him they built a
1942,BETHLEHEM,"beautiful little house, and he made little rush brooms and sold them to"
1943,BETHLEHEM,the passers-by; but he lived ever after close to the Tinkle-Tinkle’s
1944,BETHLEHEM,front door.
1945,BETHLEHEM,
1946,BETHLEHEM,So it went on till all the Tinkle-Tinkle’s homes were full of strange
1947,BETHLEHEM,"occupants, and he began to feel very old and worn and weary.  Then he"
1948,BETHLEHEM,"remembered the promise of the beautiful Creature, and went slowly over"
1949,BETHLEHEM,"the sea hoping the time had come for it to be fulfilled, and it had.  The"
1950,BETHLEHEM,beautiful Creature stretched out its lovely rose and purple wings and
1951,BETHLEHEM,"wrapped the Tinkle-Tinkle in their warm soft greatness, and bore him down"
1952,BETHLEHEM,and down through the depths till they came to the Great Gate.  At the
1953,BETHLEHEM,"beautiful Creature’s voice it swung slowly back, and they passed down the"
1954,BETHLEHEM,"Blue Pathway, which is all ice, cut and carved into lovely pinnacles and"
1955,BETHLEHEM,"spires, very blue with the blue of the summer sky and the southern seas."
1956,BETHLEHEM,The Tinkle-Tinkle could just see it from between the beautiful Creature’s
1957,BETHLEHEM,"wings, stretching away in the blue distance, and at the end one star."
1958,BETHLEHEM,
1959,BETHLEHEM,Presently—and though the time had been one thousand years it had not
1960,BETHLEHEM,seemed long to the Tinkle-Tinkle—they came out into a beautiful place
1961,BETHLEHEM,"that was nothing but light, and the beautiful Creature set the"
1962,BETHLEHEM,Tinkle-Tinkle down; he looked around him and saw many other
1963,BETHLEHEM,"Tinkle-Tinkles, and he knew them for what they were and loved their"
1964,BETHLEHEM,beauty; and the Creature gently swept one of its purple pinions across
1965,BETHLEHEM,"him, and the Tinkle-Tinkle took form.  He had many, many little soft,"
1966,BETHLEHEM,"strong hands and many little white feet, and long sweeping wings and a"
1967,BETHLEHEM,face which shone with something of the light of the beautiful Creature;
1968,BETHLEHEM,and the Tinkle-Tinkle saw and understood and sang for joy.
