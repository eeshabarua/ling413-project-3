250,[WALT MASON],
251,[WALT MASON],
252,[WALT MASON],A Poet of the People
253,[WALT MASON],
254,[WALT MASON],
255,[WALT MASON],Walt Mason's Prose Rhymes are read daily by approximately ten million
256,[WALT MASON],readers.
257,[WALT MASON],
258,[WALT MASON],A newspaper service sells these rhymes to two hundred newspapers with a
259,[WALT MASON],"combined daily circulation of nearly five million, and assuming that"
260,[WALT MASON],five people read each newspaper--which is the number agreed upon by
261,[WALT MASON],publicity experts--it may be called a fair guess to say that two out of
262,[WALT MASON],every five readers of newspapers read Mr. Mason's poems.
263,[WALT MASON],
264,[WALT MASON],So the ten million daily readers is a reasonably accurate estimate. No
265,[WALT MASON],other American verse-maker has such a daily audience.
266,[WALT MASON],
267,[WALT MASON],"Walt Mason is, therefore, the Poet Laureate of the American Democracy."
268,[WALT MASON],He is the voice of the people.
269,[WALT MASON],
270,[WALT MASON],"Put to a vote, Walt would be elected to the Laureate's job, if he got a"
271,[WALT MASON],"vote for each reader. And, generally speaking, men would vote as they"
272,[WALT MASON],read.
273,[WALT MASON],
274,[WALT MASON],The reason Walt Mason has such a large number of readers is because he
275,[WALT MASON],says what the average man is thinking so that the average man can
276,[WALT MASON],understand it.
277,[WALT MASON],
278,[WALT MASON],The philosophy of Walt Mason is the philosophy of America. Briefly it is
279,[WALT MASON],"this: The fiddler must be paid; if you don't care to pay, don't dance."
280,[WALT MASON],"In the meantime--grin and bear it, because you've got to bear it, and"
281,[WALT MASON],you might as well grin. But don't try to lie out of it. The Lord hates a
282,[WALT MASON],cheerful liar.
283,[WALT MASON],
284,[WALT MASON],This is what the American likes to hear. For that is the American idea
285,[WALT MASON],about the way the world is put together. So he reads Walt Mason night
286,[WALT MASON],and morning and smiles and takes his knife and cuts out the piece and
287,[WALT MASON],"carries it in his vest pocket, or her handbag."
288,[WALT MASON],
289,[WALT MASON],It will interest the ten million readers of Walt Mason's rhymes to know
290,[WALT MASON],"that they are written in Emporia, Kansas, in the office of the Emporia"
291,[WALT MASON],"Gazette, after Mr. Mason has done a day's work as editorial writer and"
292,[WALT MASON],telegraph editor of an afternoon paper. The rhymes are written on a
293,[WALT MASON],typewriter as rapidly as he would write if he were turning out prose.
294,[WALT MASON],
295,[WALT MASON],"Day after day, year after year, the fountain flows. There is no poison"
296,[WALT MASON],in it. And sometimes real poetry comes welling up from this Pierian
297,[WALT MASON],"spring at 517 Merchant street, Emporia, Kansas, U. S. A."
298,[WALT MASON],
299,[WALT MASON],In the meantime we do not claim its medicinal properties will cure
300,[WALT MASON],everything. But it is good for sore eyes; it cures the blues; it
301,[WALT MASON],"sweetens the temper, cleanses the head, and aids the digestion. In cases"
302,[WALT MASON],of heart trouble it has been known to unite torn ligaments and encourage
303,[WALT MASON],large families.
304,[WALT MASON],
305,[WALT MASON],And a gentleman over there takes a bottle! Step up quickly; remember we
306,[WALT MASON],are merely introducing this great natural remedy. Our supply is limited.
307,[WALT MASON],In a moment the music will begin.

331,[WALT MASON],"Charles the First, with stately walk, made the journey to the block. As"
332,[WALT MASON],"he paced the street along, silence fell upon the throng; from that"
333,[WALT MASON],"throng there burst a sigh, for a king was come to die! Charles upon the"
334,[WALT MASON],"scaffold stood, in his veins no craven blood; calm, serene, he viewed"
335,[WALT MASON],"the crowd, while the headsman said, aloud: ""Cheer up, Charlie! Smile and"
336,[WALT MASON],"sing! Death's a most delightful thing! I will cure your hacking cough,"
337,[WALT MASON],"when I chop your headpiece off! Headache, toothache--they're a bore! You"
338,[WALT MASON],"will never have them more! Cheer up, Charlie, dance and yell! Here's the"
339,[WALT MASON],"axe, and all is well! I, though but a humble dub, represent the Sunshine"
340,[WALT MASON],"Club, and our motto is worth while: 'Do Not Worry--Sing and Smile!'"
341,[WALT MASON],"Therefore let us both be gay, as we do our stunt today; I to swing the"
342,[WALT MASON],"shining axe, you to take a few swift whacks. Lumpty-doodle, lumpty-ding,"
343,[WALT MASON],"do not worry, smile and sing!"""

2788,[WALT MASON],the sun is useful in its way; it nourishes the wheat and hay--so let the

2931,[WALT MASON],"parade, and put a laurel crown on Vice; and Honor saw her trophies fade,"

3788,[WALT MASON],"forests are sighing and moaning all day; the night winds are crying,"
3789,[WALT MASON],upon their sad way; the gray clouds are taking a threatening shape; the
3790,[WALT MASON],"dead grass is shaking like billows of crape. Dame Nature is tender, and"
3791,[WALT MASON],"dirges she'll croon, regretting the splendor and glory of June; she"
3792,[WALT MASON],knows that tomorrow the old year will sleep; she knows that the sorrow
3793,[WALT MASON],"of parting is deep. In this world, O never can friends with us stay!"
3794,[WALT MASON],Some loved one forever is going away! And that is the story of people
3795,[WALT MASON],"and years; a morning of glory, an evening of tears; an hour of"
3796,[WALT MASON],"caressing, a call at the dawn, a prayer and a blessing, and then they"
3797,[WALT MASON],are gone.
