161,I,
162,I,"Shades of Callimachus, Coan ghosts of Philetas"
163,I,"It is in your grove I would walk,"
164,I,I who come first from the clear font
165,I,"Bringing the Grecian orgies into Italy, and the dance into Italy."
166,I,"Who hath taught you so subtle a measure, in what hall have you heard it;"
167,I,"What foot beat out your time-bar, what water has mellowed your whistles?"
168,I,
169,I,"Out-weariers of Apollo will, as we know, continue their Martian"
170,I,generalities.
171,I,"We have kept our erasers in order,"
172,I,A new-fangled chariot follows the flower-hung horses;
173,I,A young Muse with young loves clustered about her ascends with me into
174,I,"the aether, ..."
175,I,And there is no high-road to the Muses.
176,I,
177,I,"Annalists will continue to record Roman reputations,"
178,I,Celebrities from the Trans-Caucasus will belaud Roman celebrities
179,I,"And expound the distentions of Empire,"
180,I,
181,I,But for something to read in normal circumstances?
182,I,For a few pages brought down from the forked hill unsullied?
183,I,I ask a wreath which will not crush my head.
184,I,And there is no hurry about it;
185,I,"I shall have, doubtless, a boom after my funeral,"
186,I,Seeing that long standing increases all things regardless of quality.
187,I,
188,I,And who would have known the towers pulled down by a deal-wood horse;
189,I,Or of Achilles withstaying waters by Simois
190,I,"Or of Hector spattering wheel-rims,"
191,I,
192,I,"Or of Polydmantus, by Scamander, or Helenus and Deiphoibos?"
193,I,"Their door-yards would scarcely know them, or Paris."
194,I,"Small talk O Ilion, and O Troad twice taken by Oetian gods,"
195,I,If Homer had not stated your case!
196,I,
197,I,And I also among the later nephews of this city shall have my dog’s day
198,I,"With no stone upon my contemptible sepulchre,"
199,I,"My vote coming from the temple of Phoebus in Lycia, at Patara,"
200,I,"And in the mean time my songs will travel,"
201,I,And the devirginated young ladies will enjoy them when they have got
202,I,"over the strangeness,"
203,I,For Orpheus tamed the wild beasts--and held up the Threician river;
204,I,And Citharaon shook up the rocks by Thebes and danced them into a
205,I,"bulwark at his pleasure,"
206,I,"And you, O Polyphemus? Did harsh Galatea almost"
207,I,"Turn to your dripping horses, because of a tune, under Aetna?"
208,I,We must look into the matter.
209,I,"Bacchus and Apollo in favour of it,"
210,I,"There will be a crowd of young women doing homage to my palaver,"
211,I,Though my house is not propped up by Taenarian columns from Laconia
212,I,"(associated with Neptune and Cerberus),"
213,I,Though it is not stretched upon gilded beams;
214,I,My orchards do not lie level and wide
215,I,"as the forests of Phaecia,"
216,I,"the luxurious and Ionian,"
217,I,"Nor are my caverns stuffed stiff with a Marcian vintage,"
218,I,"(My cellar does not date from Numa Pompilius,"
219,I,Nor bristle with wine jars)
220,I,Yet the companions of the Muses
221,I,"will keep their collective nose in my books,"
222,I,"And weary with historical data, they will turn to my dance tune."
223,I,
224,I,"Happy who are mentioned in my pamphlets, the songs shall be a fine"
225,I,tomb-stone over their beauty.
226,I,But against this?
227,I,"Neither expensive pyramids scraping the stars in their route,"
228,I,"Nor houses modelled upon that of Jove in East Elis,"
229,I,"Nor the monumental effigies of Mausolus,"
230,I,are a complete elucidation of death.
231,I,"Flame burns, rain sinks into the cracks"
232,I,And they all go to rack ruin beneath the thud of the years.
233,I,
234,I,"Stands genius a deathless adornment,"
235,I,a name not to be worn out with the years.
236,I,
237,I,
238,II,II
239,II,
240,II,"I had been seen in the shade, recumbent on cushioned Helicon,"
241,II,"the water dripping from Bellerophon’s horse,"
242,II,"Alba, your kings, and the realm your folk"
243,II,have constructed with such industry
244,II,Shall be yawned out on my lyre--with such industry.
245,II,"My little mouth shall gobble in such great fountains,"
246,II,"“Wherefrom father Ennius, sitting before I came, hath drunk.”"
247,II,
248,II,"I had rehearsed the Curian brothers, and made remarks on the"
249,II,Horatian javelin
250,II,(Near Q. H. Flaccus’ book-stall).
251,II,"“Of” royal Aemilia, drawn on the memorial raft,"
252,II,"“Of” the victorious delay of Fabius, and the left-handed"
253,II,"battle at Cannae,"
254,II,Of lares fleeing the “Roman seat” ...
255,II,I had sung of all these
256,II,"And of Hannibal,"
257,II,and of Jove protected by geese.
258,II,"And Phoebus looking upon me from the Castalian tree,"
259,II,Said then “You idiot! What are you doing with that water;
260,II,“Who has ordered a book about heroes?
261,II,"You need, Propertius, not think"
262,II,“About acquiring that sort of a reputation.
263,II,"“Soft fields must be worn by small wheels,"
264,II,"“Your pamphlets will be thrown, thrown often into a chair"
265,II,“Where a girl waits alone for her lover;
266,II,“Why wrench your page out of its course?
267,II,“No keel will sink with your genius
268,II,"“Let another oar churn the water,"
269,II,"“Another wheel, the arena; mid-crowd is as bad as mid-sea.”"
270,II,
271,II,"He had spoken, and pointed me a place with his plectrum:"
272,II,
273,II,"Orgies of vintages, an earthern image of Silenus"
274,II,"Strengthened with rushes, Tegaean Pan,"
275,II,"The small birds of the Cytharean mother,"
276,II,their Punic faces dyed in the Gorgon’s lake;
277,II,"Nine girls, from as many countrysides"
278,II,"bearing her offerings in their unhardened hands,"
279,II,
280,II,Such my cohort and setting. And she bound ivy to his thyrsos;
281,II,Fitted song to the strings;
282,II,Roses twined in her hands.
283,II,"And one among them looked at me with face offended,"
284,II,Calliope:
285,II,“Content ever to move with white swans!
286,II,“Nor will the noise of high horses lead you ever to battle;
287,II,“Nor will the public criers ever have your name
288,II,"in their classic horns,"
289,II,"“Nor Mars shout you in the wood at Aeonium,"
290,II,"Nor where Rome ruins German riches,"
291,II,"“Nor where the Rhine flows with barbarous blood,"
292,II,and flood carries wounded Suevi.
293,II,"“Obviously crowned lovers at unknown doors,"
294,II,"“Night dogs, the marks of a drunken scurry,"
295,II,"“These are your images, and from you the sorcerizing"
296,II,"of shut-in young ladies,"
297,II,“The wounding of austere men by chicane.”
298,II,
299,II,"Thus Mistress Calliope,"
300,II,"Dabbling her hands in the fount, thus she"
301,II,Stiffened our face with the backwash of Philetas the Coan.
302,II,
303,II,
304,III,III
305,III,
306,III,"Midnight, and a letter comes to me from our"
307,III,mistress:
308,III,"Telling me to come to Tibur, _At_ once!!:"
309,III,"“Bright tips reach up from twin towers,"
310,III,Anienan spring water falls into flat-spread pools.”
311,III,
312,III,What _is_ to be done about it?
313,III,"Shall I entrust myself to entangled shadows,"
314,III,Where bold hands may do violence to my person?
315,III,
316,III,Yet if I postpone my obedience
317,III,because of this respectable terror
318,III,I shall be prey to lamentations worse than a nocturnal assailant.
319,III,"_And_ I shall be in the wrong,"
320,III,"_and_ it will last a twelve month,"
321,III,"For her hands have no kindness me-ward,"
322,III,
323,III,Nor is there anyone to whom lovers are not sacred at midnight
324,III,And in the Via Sciro.
325,III,
326,III,If any man would be a lover
327,III,"he may walk on the Scythian coast,"
328,III,"No barbarism would go to the extent of doing him harm,"
329,III,"The moon will carry his candle,"
330,III,"the stars will point out the stumbles,"
331,III,Cupid will carry lighted torches before him
332,III,and keep mad dogs off his ankles.
333,III,
334,III,Thus all roads are perfectly safe
335,III,and at any hour;
336,III,Who so indecorous as to shed the pure gore of a suitor? I
337,III,Cypris is his cicerone.
338,III,
339,III,"What if undertakers follow my track,"
340,III,such a death is worth dying.
341,III,"She would bring frankincense and wreaths to my tomb,"
342,III,She would sit like an ornament on my pyre.
343,III,
344,III,"Gods’ aid, let not my bones lie in a public location"
345,III,with crowds too assiduous in their crossing of it;
346,III,For thus are tombs of lovers most desecrated.
347,III,
348,III,May a woody and sequestered place cover me with its foliage
349,III,Or may I inter beneath the hummock
350,III,of some as yet uncatalogued sand;
351,III,At any rate I shall not have my epitaph in a high road.

365,DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH LYGDAMUS,For I am swelled up with inane pleasurabilities
366,DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH LYGDAMUS,and deceived by your reference
367,DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH LYGDAMUS,To things which you think I would like to believe.
368,DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH LYGDAMUS,
369,DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH LYGDAMUS,"No messenger should come wholly empty,"

372,DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH LYGDAMUS,"Out with it, tell it to me, all of it, from the beginning,"
373,DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH LYGDAMUS,I guzzle with outstretched ears.
374,DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH LYGDAMUS,"Thus? She wept into uncombed hair,"

376,DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH LYGDAMUS,Vast waters flowed from her eyes?
377,DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH LYGDAMUS,"You, you Lygdamus"
378,DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH LYGDAMUS,"Saw her stretched on her bed,--"
379,DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH LYGDAMUS,it was no glimpse in a mirror;
380,DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH LYGDAMUS,"No gawds on her snowy hands, no orfevrerie,"
381,DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH LYGDAMUS,Sad garment draped on her slender arms.
382,DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH LYGDAMUS,Her escritoires lay shut by the bed-feet.
383,DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH LYGDAMUS,"Sadness hung over the house, and the desolated female attendants"
384,DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH LYGDAMUS,Were desolated because she had told them her dreams.
385,DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH LYGDAMUS,
386,DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH LYGDAMUS,"She was veiled in the midst of that place,"
387,DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH LYGDAMUS,"Damp wooly handkerchiefs were stuffed into her undryable eyes,"
388,DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH LYGDAMUS,And a querulous noise responded to our solicitous reprobations.
389,DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH LYGDAMUS,
390,DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH LYGDAMUS,"For which things you will get a reward from me,"
391,DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH LYGDAMUS,Lygdamus?

415,V,
416,V,Now if ever it is time to cleanse Helicon;
417,V,"to lead Emathian horses afield,"
418,V,And to name over the census of my chiefs in the Roman camp.
419,V,"If I have not the faculty, “The bare attempt would be praise-worthy.”"
420,V,“In things of similar magnitude
421,V,the mere will to act is sufficient.”
422,V,
423,V,"The primitive ages sang Venus,"
424,V,"the last sings of a tumult,"
425,V,And I also will sing war when this matter of a girl is exhausted.
426,V,
427,V,"I with my beak hauled ashore would proceed in a more stately manner,"
428,V,"My Muse is eager to instruct me in a new gamut, or gambetto,"
429,V,"Up, up my soul, from your lowly cantilation,"
430,V,"put on a timely vigour,"
431,V,
432,V,Oh august Pierides! Now for a large-mouthed product.
433,V,Thus:
434,V,“The Euphrates denies its protection to the Parthian
435,V,"and apologizes for Crassus,”"
436,V,"And “It is, I think, India which now gives necks to your triumph,”"
437,V,"And so forth, Augustus. “Virgin Arabia shakes in her inmost dwelling.”"
438,V,"If any land shrink into a distant seacoast,"
439,V,"it is a mere postponement of your domination,"
440,V,"And I shall follow the camp, I shall be duly celebrated,"
441,V,for singing the affairs of your cavalry.
442,V,May the fates watch over my day.
443,V,
444,V,2
445,V,
446,V,Yet you ask on what account I write so many love-lyrics
447,V,And whence this soft book comes into my mouth.
448,V,"Neither Calliope nor Apollo sung these things into my ear,"
449,V,My genius is no more than a girl.
450,V,
451,V,"If she with ivory fingers drive a tune through the lyre,"
452,V,We look at the process
453,V,"How easy the moving fingers; if hair is mussed on her forehead,"
454,V,"If she goes in a gleam of Cos, in a slither of dyed stuff,"
