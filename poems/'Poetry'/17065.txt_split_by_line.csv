32,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
33,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
34,I.  ON CRITICISM.,Criticism is the art of judging.  As reasonable persons we are called
35,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"upon to be constantly pronouncing judgment, and either acting upon such"
36,I.  ON CRITICISM.,judgment ourselves or inviting others to do so.  I do not know how
37,I.  ON CRITICISM.,anything can be more important with respect to any matter than the
38,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"forming a right judgment about it.  We pray that we may have ""a right"
39,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"judgment in all things.""  I am aware that it is an old saying that"
40,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"""people are better than their opinions,"" and it is a mercy that it is so,"
41,I.  ON CRITICISM.,for very many persons not only are full of false opinions upon almost
42,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"every subject, but even think that it is of no consequence what opinions"
43,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"they hold.  Whether a particular action is morally right or wrong, or"
44,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"whether a book or a picture is really good or bad, is a matter upon which"
45,I.  ON CRITICISM.,they form either no judgment or a wrong one with perfect equanimity.  The
46,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"secret of this state of mind is, I think, that it is on the whole too"
47,I.  ON CRITICISM.,much bother to form a correct judgment; and it is so much easier to let
48,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"things slide, and to take the good the gods provide you, than to"
49,I.  ON CRITICISM.,carefully hold the scales until the balance is steady.  But can anybody
50,I.  ON CRITICISM.,doubt that this abdication of the seat of judgment by large numbers of
51,I.  ON CRITICISM.,people is most hurtful to mankind?  Does anyone believe that there would
52,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"be so many bad books, bad pictures, and bad buildings in the world if"
53,I.  ON CRITICISM.,people were more justly critical?  Bad things continue to be produced in
54,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"profusion, and worse things are born of them, because a vast number of"
55,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"people do not know that the things are bad, and do not care, even if they"
56,I.  ON CRITICISM.,do know.  What sells the endless trash published every day?  Not the
57,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"_few_ purchasers who buy what is vile because they like it, but the"
58,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"_many_ purchasers who do not know that the things are bad, and when they"
59,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"are told so, think there is not much harm in it after all.  In short,"
60,I.  ON CRITICISM.,they think that judging rightly is of no consequence and only a bore.
61,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
62,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"But I think I shall carry you all with me when I say that this society,"
63,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"almost by its very _raison d'etre_, desires to form just and proper"
64,I.  ON CRITICISM.,judgments; and that one of the principal objects which we have in view in
65,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"meeting together from time to time is to learn what should be thought,"
66,I.  ON CRITICISM.,and what ought to be known; and by comparing our own judgments of things
67,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"with those of our neighbours, to arrive at a just modification of our"
68,I.  ON CRITICISM.,rough and imperfect ideas.
69,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
70,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Although criticism is the act of judging in general, and although I shall"
71,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"not strictly limit my subject to any particular branch of criticism, yet"
72,I.  ON CRITICISM.,naturally I shall be led to speak principally of that branch of which
73,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"we--probably all of us--think at once when the word is mentioned, viz.,"
74,I.  ON CRITICISM.,literary and artistic criticism.  I think if criticism were juster and
75,I.  ON CRITICISM.,fairer persons criticized would submit more readily to criticism.  It is
76,I.  ON CRITICISM.,certain that criticism is generally resented.  We--none of us--like to be
77,I.  ON CRITICISM.,told our faults.
78,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
79,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"""Tell Blackwood,"" said Sir Walter Scott, ""that I am one of the Black"
80,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Hussars of Literature who neither give nor take criticism.""  Tennyson"
81,I.  ON CRITICISM.,resented any interference with his muse by writing the now nearly
82,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"forgotten line about ""Musty, crusty Christopher.""  Byron flew into a"
83,I.  ON CRITICISM.,rhapsodical passion and wrote _English Bards and Scotch Reviewers_--
84,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
85,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"""Ode, Epic, Elegy, have at you all."""
86,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
87,I.  ON CRITICISM.,He says--
88,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
89,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"""A man must serve his time to every trade"
90,I.  ON CRITICISM.,Save censure.  Critics all are ready made.
91,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Take hackney'd jokes from Miller, got by rote,"
92,I.  ON CRITICISM.,With just enough of learning to misquote;
93,I.  ON CRITICISM.,A mind well skilled to find or forge a fault;
94,I.  ON CRITICISM.,A turn for punning--call it Attic salt;
95,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"To Jeffrey go, be silent and discreet,--"
96,I.  ON CRITICISM.,His pay is just ten sterling pounds per sheet;
97,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Fear not to lie, 'twill seem a sharper hit;"
98,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Shrink not from blasphemy, 'twill pass for wit;"
99,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Care not for feeling--pass your proper jest,--"
100,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"And stand a critic, hated yet caress'd."""
101,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
102,I.  ON CRITICISM.,Lowell retorted upon his enemies in the famous _Fable for Critics_.
103,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Swift, in his _Battle of the Books_, revenges himself upon Criticism by"
104,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"describing her.  ""She dwelt on the top of a snowy mountain in Nova"
105,I.  ON CRITICISM.,Zembla.  There Momus found her extended in her den upon the spoils of
106,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"numberless volumes, half devoured.  At her right hand sat Ignorance, her"
107,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"father and husband, blind with age; at her left Pride, her mother,"
108,I.  ON CRITICISM.,dressing her up in the scraps of paper herself had torn.  About her
109,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"played her children Noise and Impudence, Dulness and Vanity, Pedantry and"
110,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Ill-manners.  The goddess herself had claws like a cat.  Her head, ears,"
111,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"and voice resembled those of an ass.""  Bulwer (Lord Lytton) flew out"
112,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"against his critics, and was well laughed at by Thackeray for his pains."
113,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Poets are known as the _genus irritabile_, and I do not know that prose"
114,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"writers, artists, or musicians are less susceptible.  Most of us will"
115,I.  ON CRITICISM.,remember Sheridan's _Critic_--
116,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
117,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Sneer: ""I think it wants incident."""
118,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
119,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Sir Fretful: ""Good Heavens, you surprise me!  Wants incident!  I am only"
120,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"apprehensive that the incidents are too crowded."""
121,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
122,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Dangle: ""If I might venture to suggest anything, it is that the interest"
123,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"rather falls off in the fifth act."""
124,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
125,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Sir Fretful: ""Rises, I believe you mean, sir."""
126,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
127,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Mrs. Dangle: ""I did not see a fault in any part of the play from the"
128,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"beginning to the end."""
129,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
130,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Sir Fretful: ""Upon my soul the women are the best judges after all."""
131,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
132,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"In short, no one objects to a favourable criticism, and almost every one"
133,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"objects to an unfavourable one.  All men ought, no doubt, to be thankful"
134,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"for a just criticism; but I am afraid they are not.  As a result, to"
135,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"criticize is to be unpopular.  Nevertheless, it is better to be unpopular"
136,I.  ON CRITICISM.,than to be untruthful.
137,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
138,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"""The truth once out,--and wherefore should we lie?--"
139,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"The Queen of Midas slept, and so can I."""
140,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
141,I.  ON CRITICISM.,I am going to do a rather dreadful thing.  I am going to divide criticism
142,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"into six heads.  By the bye, I am not sure that sermons now-a-days are"
143,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"any better than they used to be in the good old times, when there were"
144,I.  ON CRITICISM.,always three heads at least to every sermon.  Criticism should be--1.
145,I.  ON CRITICISM.,Appreciative. 2.  Proportionate. 3.  Appropriate. 4.  Strong. 5.  Natural.
146,I.  ON CRITICISM.,6.  _Bona fide_.
147,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
148,I.  ON CRITICISM.,1.  _Criticism should be appreciative_.
149,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
150,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"By this I mean, not that critics should always praise, but that they"
151,I.  ON CRITICISM.,should understand.  They should see the thing as it is and comprehend it.
152,I.  ON CRITICISM.,This is the rock upon which most criticisms fail--want of knowledge.  In
153,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"reading the lives of great men, how often are we struck with the want of"
154,I.  ON CRITICISM.,appreciation of their fellows.  Who admired Turner's pictures until
155,I.  ON CRITICISM.,Turner's death?  Who praised Tennyson's poems until Tennyson was quite an
156,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"old man?  Nay, I am afraid some of us have laughed at those who"
157,I.  ON CRITICISM.,endeavoured to ask our attention to what we called the daubs of the one
158,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"or the doggerel of the other.  {5}This, I think, should teach us not even"
159,I.  ON CRITICISM.,to attempt to criticize until we are sure that we appreciate.  Yet what a
160,I.  ON CRITICISM.,vast amount of criticism there is in the world which errs (like Dr.
161,I.  ON CRITICISM.,Johnson) from sheer ignorance.  When Sir Lucius O'Trigger found fault
162,I.  ON CRITICISM.,with Mrs. Malaprop's language she naturally resented such ignorant
163,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"criticism.  ""If there is one thing more than another upon which I pride"
164,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"myself, it is the use of my oracular tongue and a nice derangement of"
165,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"epitaphs.""  It was absurd to have one's English criticized by any"
166,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Irishman.  It is said that ""it's a pity when lovely women talk of things"
167,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"that they don't understand""; but I am afraid that men are equally given"
168,I.  ON CRITICISM.,to the same vice.  I have heard men give the most confident opinions upon
169,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"subjects which they don't in the least understand, which nobody expects"
170,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"them to understand, nor have they had any opportunity for acquiring the"
171,I.  ON CRITICISM.,requisite knowledge.  But I suppose an Englishman is nothing if he is not
172,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"dictatorial, and has a right to say that the pictures in the Louvre are"
173,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"""orrid"" or that the Colosseum is a ""himposition.""  ""I don't know what"
174,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"they mean by Lucerne being the Queen of the Lakes,"" said a Yankee to me,"
175,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"""but I calc'late Lake St. George is a doocid deal bigger.""  The criticism"
176,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"was true as far as it went, but the man had no conception of beauty."
177,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
178,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"""Each might his several province well command"
179,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Would all but stoop to what they understand."""
180,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
181,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"The receipt given for an essay on Chinese Metaphysics was, look out China"
182,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"under the letter C and metaphysics under the letter M, and combine your"
183,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"information.  ""Would you mind telling me, sir, if the Cambridge boat"
184,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"keeps time or not to-day?"" said a man on the banks of the Thames to me."
185,I.  ON CRITICISM.,He explained that he was a political-meeting reporter on the staff of a
186,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"penny paper, and the sporting reporter was ill.  Sometimes the want of"
187,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"appreciation appears in a somewhat remarkable manner, as where a really"
188,I.  ON CRITICISM.,good performance is praised for its blemishes and not for its merits.
189,I.  ON CRITICISM.,This may be done from a desire to appear singular or from ignorance.  The
190,I.  ON CRITICISM.,popular estimate is generally wrong from want of appreciation.  The
191,I.  ON CRITICISM.,majority of people praise what is not worthy of praise and dislike what
192,I.  ON CRITICISM.,is.  So that it is almost a test of worthlessness that the multitudes
193,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"approve.  Baron Bramwell, in discharging a prisoner at the Old Bailey,"
194,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"made what he thought some appropriate observations, which were followed"
195,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"by a storm of applause in the crowded court.  The learned judge, with"
196,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"that caustic humour which distinguishes him, looked up and said, ""Bless"
197,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"me!  I'm afraid I must have said something very foolish.""  An amusing"
198,I.  ON CRITICISM.,scene occurred outside a barrister's lodgings during the Northampton
199,I.  ON CRITICISM.,Assizes.  Two painters decorating the exterior of the lodgings were
200,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"overheard as follows:--""Seen the judge, Bill?""  ""Ah, I see him.  Cheery"
201,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"old swine!""  ""See the sheriff too?""  ""Yes, I see him too.  I reckon he"
202,I.  ON CRITICISM.,got that place through interest.  Been to church; they tell me the judge
203,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"preached 'em a long sarmon.  Pomp and 'umbug I call that!""  This was no"
204,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"doubt genuine criticism, but it was without knowledge.  These men were"
205,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"probably voters for Bradlaugh, and the judge and the sheriff were to them"
206,I.  ON CRITICISM.,the embodiment of a hateful aristocracy.  These painters little knew how
207,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"much the judge would like to be let off even listening to the sermon, and"
208,I.  ON CRITICISM.,how the sheriff had resorted to every dodge to escape from his onerous
209,I.  ON CRITICISM.,and thankless office.
210,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
211,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"It is recorded in the Life of Lord Houghton that Prince Leopold, being"
212,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"recommended to read Plutarch for Grecian lore, got the British Plutarch"
213,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"by mistake, and laid down the Life of Sir Christopher Wren in great"
214,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"indignation, exclaiming there was hardly anything about Greece in it."
215,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
216,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"I am sure, too, that in order to understand the work of another we must"
217,I.  ON CRITICISM.,have something more than knowledge; we must have some sympathy with the
218,I.  ON CRITICISM.,work.  I do not mean that we must necessarily praise the execution of it;
219,I.  ON CRITICISM.,but we must be in such a frame of mind that the success of the work would
220,I.  ON CRITICISM.,give us pleasure.  I am sure someone says somewhere that a man whose
221,I.  ON CRITICISM.,first emotion upon seeing anything good is to undervalue it will never do
222,I.  ON CRITICISM.,anything good of his own.  It argues a want of genius in ourselves if we
223,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"fail to see it in others; unless, indeed, we do really see it, and only"
224,I.  ON CRITICISM.,_say_ we don't out of envy.  This is very shameful.  I had rather do like
225,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"some amiable people I have known, disparage the work of a friend in order"
226,I.  ON CRITICISM.,to set others praising it.
227,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
228,I.  ON CRITICISM.,Criticism should therefore be appreciative in two ways.  The critic
229,I.  ON CRITICISM.,should bring the requisite amount and kind of knowledge and the proper
230,I.  ON CRITICISM.,frame of mind and temper.
231,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
232,I.  ON CRITICISM.,2.  _Criticism should be proportionate_.
233,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
234,I.  ON CRITICISM.,By this I mean that the language in which we speak of anything should be
235,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"proportioned to the thing spoken of.  If you speak of St. Paul's Church,"
236,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Beckenham, as vast, grand, magnificent, you have no language left"
237,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"wherewith to describe St. Paul's, London.  If you call Millais' Huguenots"
238,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"sublime or divine, what becomes of the Madonna St. Sisto of Raphael?  If"
239,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"you describe Longfellow's poetry as the feeblest possible trash, the"
240,I.  ON CRITICISM.,coarsest and most unparliamentary language could alone express your
241,I.  ON CRITICISM.,contempt of Martin Tupper.
242,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
243,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"""What's the good of calling a woman a Wenus, Samivel?"" asked the elder"
244,I.  ON CRITICISM.,Weller.  What indeed!  The elder Weller probably perceived that the
245,I.  ON CRITICISM.,language would be out of all proportion to the object of Samivel's
246,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"affections.  Of course, something may be allowed to a generous"
247,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"enthusiasm, and, with regard to this fault in criticism, it should"
248,I.  ON CRITICISM.,perhaps be said that exaggerated praise is not so base in its beginning
249,I.  ON CRITICISM.,or so harmful in the end as exaggerated blame.  From the use of the
250,I.  ON CRITICISM.,former Dr. Johnson defended himself with his usual vigour.  Boswell
251,I.  ON CRITICISM.,presumed to find fault with him for saying that the death of Garrick had
252,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"eclipsed the gaiety of nations.  Johnson: ""I could not have said more,"
253,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"nor less.  It is the truth.  His death did eclipse, it was like a storm."""
254,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Boswell: ""But why nations?  Did his gaiety extend further than his own"
255,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"nation?""  Johnson: ""Why, sir, some exaggeration must be allowed.  Besides,"
256,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"'nations' may be said--if we allow the Scotch to be a nation, and to have"
257,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"gaiety,--which they have not."""
258,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
259,I.  ON CRITICISM.,But there is more in this matter of proportion than at first meets the
260,I.  ON CRITICISM.,eye.  How often do we converse with a man whose language we wonder at and
261,I.  ON CRITICISM.,cannot quite make out.  It is somehow unsatisfactory.  We do not quite
262,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"like it, yet there is nothing particular to dislike.  Suddenly we"
263,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"perceive that there is a want of perspective, or perhaps a want of what"
264,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"artists call value.  His mountains are mole-hills, and his mole-hills are"
265,I.  ON CRITICISM.,mountains.  His colouring is so badly managed that the effect of
266,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"distance, light, and shade are lost.  Thus a man will so insist upon the"
267,I.  ON CRITICISM.,use of difficult words by George Elliot that a person unacquainted with
268,I.  ON CRITICISM.,her writings would think that the whole merit or demerit of that author
269,I.  ON CRITICISM.,lay in her vocabulary.  A man will so exalt the pathos of Dickens or
270,I.  ON CRITICISM.,Thackeray that he will throw their wit and humour into the background.
271,I.  ON CRITICISM.,Some person's only remark on seeing Turner's Modern Italy will be that
272,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"the colours are cracked, or, upon reading Sterne, that he always wrote"
273,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"""you was"" instead of ""you were.""  ""Did it ever strike you,"" said a friend"
274,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"of mine, ""that whenever you hear of a young woman found drowned she"
275,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"always is described as having worn elastic boots?""  Such persons look at"
276,I.  ON CRITICISM.,all things through a distorting medium.  Important things become
277,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"unimportant and _vice versa_.  The foreground is thrust back, the"
278,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"distance brought forward, and the middle distance is nowhere.  The effect"
279,I.  ON CRITICISM.,of an exaggerated praise generally is that an unfair reaction sets in.
280,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Mr. Justin M'Carthy, in his _History of Our Own Times_, points out how"
281,I.  ON CRITICISM.,much the character of Lord Stratford de Redcliffe has suffered from the
282,I.  ON CRITICISM.,absurd devotion of Kinglake.  Kinglake writes (he says) of Lord Stratford
283,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"de Redcliffe ""as if he were describing the all-compelling movements of"
284,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"some divinity or providence.""  What nonsense has been talked about"
285,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Millais' landscapes, Whistler's nocturnes, Swinburne poetry--all"
286,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"excellent enough in their way, and requiring to be praised according to"
287,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"their merits, with a reserve as to their faults.  The practice of puffing"
288,I.  ON CRITICISM.,tends to destroy all sort of proportion in criticism.  When single
289,I.  ON CRITICISM.,sentences or portions of sentences of apparently unqualified praise are
290,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"detached from context, and heaped together so as to induce the public to"
291,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"think that all praise and no blame has been awarded, of course all"
292,I.  ON CRITICISM.,proportion is lost.  Macaulay lashed this vice in his celebrated essay on
293,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Robert Montgomery's poems.  ""We expect some reserve,"" he says, ""some"
294,I.  ON CRITICISM.,decent pride in our hatter and our bootmaker.  But no artifice by which
295,I.  ON CRITICISM.,notoriety can be obtained is thought too abject for a man of letters.
296,I.  ON CRITICISM.,Extreme poverty may indeed in some degree be an excuse for employing
297,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"these shifts as it may be an excuse for stealing a leg of mutton."""
298,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
299,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Upon the other hand, how unfair is exaggerated blame.  I am not speaking"
300,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"here of that which is intentionally unfair, but of blame fairly meant and"
301,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"in some degree deserved, but where the language is out of all proportion"
302,I.  ON CRITICISM.,to the offence.
303,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
304,I.  ON CRITICISM.,Ruskin so belaboured the poor ancients about their landscapes that when I
305,I.  ON CRITICISM.,was a youth he had taught me to believe that Claude and Ruisdael were
306,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"mere duffers.  So when he speaks of Whistler, as we shall presently see,"
307,I.  ON CRITICISM.,his blame is so exaggerated that it produces a revulsion in the mind of
308,I.  ON CRITICISM.,the reader.  He said Whistler's painting consisted in throwing a pot of
309,I.  ON CRITICISM.,paint in the public's face.  Well! we may say Whistler is somewhat
310,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"sketchy and careless or wanting in colour, but it is quite possible to"
311,I.  ON CRITICISM.,keep our tempers over it.

313,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"""This salad is very gritty,"" said a gentleman to Douglas Jerrold at a"
314,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"dinner party.  ""Gritty,"" said Jerrold, ""it's a mere gravel path with a"

317,I.  ON CRITICISM.,3.  _Criticism should be appropriate_.
318,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
319,I.  ON CRITICISM.,I mean by this something different from proportionate.  Sometimes the
320,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"language of criticism is not that of exaggeration, but yet it is quite as"
321,I.  ON CRITICISM.,inappropriate.  The critic may have taken his seat too high or too low
322,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"for a proper survey, or he may, by want of education or by carelessness,"
323,I.  ON CRITICISM.,use quite the wrong words to express his meaning.  You will hear a man
324,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"say, ""I was enchanted with the Biglow Papers,"" or ""I was charmed with the"
325,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"hyenas at the Zoological Gardens.""  I think one of the distinguishing"
326,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"characteristics of a gentleman, and what makes the society of educated"
327,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"gentlemen so pleasant, is that their language is appropriate without"
328,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"effort.  ""'What a delicious shiver is creeping over those limes!' said"
329,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Lancelot, half to himself.  The expression struck Argemone; it was the"
330,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"right one.""  This is what makes some people's conversation so"
331,I.  ON CRITICISM.,interesting.  It is full of appropriate language.  This is perhaps even
332,I.  ON CRITICISM.,more the case with educated ladies.  I think it is Macaulay who says that
333,I.  ON CRITICISM.,the ordinary letter of an English lady is the best English style to be
334,I.  ON CRITICISM.,found anywhere.

336,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"""It would be bad _grammar_,"" said Cobbett, ""to say of the House of"

338,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"swindlers.'""  Of course, the bad grammar is almost immaterial.  The"
339,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"expression is either a gross libel or a lamentable fact.  ""If a man,"""
340,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"said Sydney Smith, ""were to kill the minister and churchwardens of his"
341,I.  ON CRITICISM.,parish nobody would accuse him of want of taste.  The Scythians always
342,I.  ON CRITICISM.,ate their grandfathers; they behaved very respectfully to them for a long
343,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"time, but as soon as their grandfathers became old and troublesome, and"
344,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"began to tell long stories, they immediately ate them; nothing could be"
345,I.  ON CRITICISM.,more _improper_ and even _disrespectful_ than dining off such near and
346,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"venerable relations, yet we could not with any propriety accuse them of"
347,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"bad taste.""  This is very humorous.  To say that it is improper or"
348,I.  ON CRITICISM.,disrespectful is as absurd as to say that it is bad taste.  It is
349,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"properly described as cruel, revolting, and abominable."

373,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"I think, have now happily forgotten, and the equally silly use of the"
374,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"word ""howling"" by young men.  Such expressions mean absolutely nothing,"
375,I.  ON CRITICISM.,and are destructive of intelligent conversation.  A man was being tried
376,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"for a serious assault, and had used a violent and coarse expression"
377,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"towards the prosecutor.  ""You must be careful not to be misled by the bad"
378,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"language reported to have been used by the prisoner,"" said the judge."

383,I.  ON CRITICISM.,4.  _Criticism should be strong_.
384,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
385,I.  ON CRITICISM.,I hope from the remarks I have previously made it will not be supposed
386,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"that I think all criticism should be of a flat, neutral tint, or what may"
387,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"be called the washy order.  On the contrary, if criticism is not strong"
388,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"it cannot lift a young genius out of the struggling crowd, and it cannot"
389,I.  ON CRITICISM.,beat down some bumptious impostor.  If the critic really believes that a
390,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"new poet writes like Milton, or a new artist paints like Sir Joshua, let"
391,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"him say so; or if he thinks any work vile or contemptible, let him say"
392,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"so; but let him say so well.  Mere exaggerated language, as we have seen,"
393,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"is not strength; but if there is real strength in the criticism, and it"
394,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"is proportionate and appropriate, it will effect its purpose.  It will"
395,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"free the genius, or it will crush the humbug.  A good critic should be"
396,I.  ON CRITICISM.,feared:

406,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Pope said, and I can fancy with what a stern joy an honest critic would"
407,I.  ON CRITICISM.,arise and slay what he believed to be false and vicious.  In no time was
408,I.  ON CRITICISM.,the need of strong criticism greater than it is at present.  The press is
409,I.  ON CRITICISM.,teeming with rubbish and something worse.  Everybody reads anything that
410,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"is published with sufficient flourish and advertisement, and those who"
411,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"read have mostly no power of judging for themselves, nor would they be"
412,I.  ON CRITICISM.,turned from the garbage which seems to delight them by any gentle
413,I.  ON CRITICISM.,persuasion.  It is therefore most necessary that the critic should speak
414,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"out plainly and boldly, though with temper and discretion.  I suppose we"
415,I.  ON CRITICISM.,have all of us read Lord Macaulay's criticism upon Robert Montgomery's
416,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"poems.  The poems are, of course, forgotten; but the essay still lives as"
417,I.  ON CRITICISM.,a specimen of the terribly slashing style.  This is the way one couplet
418,I.  ON CRITICISM.,is dealt with--
419,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
420,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"""The soul aspiring pants its source to mount,"
421,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"As streams meander level with their fount."""

423,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"""We take this on the whole to be the worst similitude in the world.  In"
424,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"the first place, no stream meanders, or can possibly meander, level with"
425,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"its fount.  In the next place, if streams did meander level with their"
426,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"founts, no two motions can be less like each other than that of"
427,I.  ON CRITICISM.,meandering level and that of mounting upwards.  After saying that

434,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"made itself.""  Of course, poor Robert Montgomery was crushed flat, and"
435,I.  ON CRITICISM.,rightly.  Yet before this essay was written his poems had a larger
436,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"circulation than Southey or Coleridge, just as in our own time Martin"
437,I.  ON CRITICISM.,Tupper had a larger sale than Tennyson or Browning.  Fancy if Tupper had

502,I.  ON CRITICISM.,gild a storm by being backed by thunder.  So that here is gilding by
503,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"conforming, smiling lightning, backing and thundering.  I am mistaken if"
504,I.  ON CRITICISM.,nonsense is not here pretty thick sown.  Sure the poet writ these two
505,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"lines aboard some smack in a storm, and, being sea-sick, spewed up a good"
506,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"lump of clotted nonsense at once.""  Dryden wrote in a fit of rage and"
507,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"spite, and it is not necessary to be vulgar in order to be strong; but it"

605,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"structure of the leaf or in the avenue of the lofty limes, teaches the"
606,I.  ON CRITICISM.,architect how to adorn his designs with the most graceful of
607,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"embellishments, to rear the lofty column or display the lengthening vista"
608,I.  ON CRITICISM.,of the cathedral aisle.  It is nature who is teaching us all to be
609,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"tender, loving, and true, and to love and worship God, and to admire all"
610,I.  ON CRITICISM.,His works.  Let us then in our criticism refer everything first of all to
611,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"nature.  Is the work natural?  Does it follow nature?  Secondly, does it"
612,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"follow the rules of art?  If it passes the first test, it is well worth"
613,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"the courteous attention of the critic.  If it passes both tests, it is"
614,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"perfect.  But if only the second test is passed, it may please a few"
615,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"pedants, but it is worthless, and cannot live."

619,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"You will be rather alarmed at a lawyer beginning this topic, and will"
620,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"expect to hear pages of ""Starkie on Libel,"" or to have all the"
621,I.  ON CRITICISM.,perorations of Erskine's speeches recited to you.  For one terrible
622,I.  ON CRITICISM.,moment I feel I have you in my power; but I scorn to take advantage of
623,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"the position.  I don't mean to talk about libel at all, or, at least, not"
624,I.  ON CRITICISM.,more than I can help.  I have been endeavouring to show what good
625,I.  ON CRITICISM.,criticism should be like.  If criticism is so base that there is a
626,I.  ON CRITICISM.,question to be left to a jury as to what damages ought to be paid for the
627,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"speaking or writing of it, one may say at once that it is unworthy of the"
628,I.  ON CRITICISM.,name of criticism at all.  Slander is not criticism.  But there is a
629,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"great deal of criticism which may be called not _bona fide_, which is yet"
630,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"not malicious.  It is biassed perhaps, even from some charitable motive,"
631,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"perhaps from some sordid motive, perhaps from indolence, from a desire to"
632,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"be thought learned or clever, or what not--in fact, from one or other of"
633,I.  ON CRITICISM.,those thousand things which prevent persons from speaking fairly and
634,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"straightforwardly.  When you take up the _Athenaeum_ or the _Spectator_,"
635,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"and read from those very able reviews an account of the last new novel,"
636,I.  ON CRITICISM.,do you think the writer has written simply what he truly thinks and feels
637,I.  ON CRITICISM.,about the matter?  No! he has been told he has been dull of late.  He
638,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"feels he must write a spicy review.  He has a cold in his head, he is"
639,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"savage accordingly.  A friend of his tells him he knows the author, or he"
640,I.  ON CRITICISM.,recognizes the name of a college friend--he will be lenient.  The book is
641,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"on a subject which he meant to take up himself; and, without knowing it,"
642,I.  ON CRITICISM.,he is jealous.  I need not multiply further these suggestions which will
643,I.  ON CRITICISM.,occur to anyone.  We all remember the dinner in Paternoster Row given by
644,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Mrs. Bungay, the publisher's wife.  Bungay and Bacon are at daggers"
645,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"drawn; each married the sister of the other, and they were for some time"
646,I.  ON CRITICISM.,the closest friends and partners.  Since they have separated it is a
647,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"furious war between the two publishers, and no sooner does one bring out"
648,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"a book of travels or poems, but the rival is in the field with something"
649,I.  ON CRITICISM.,similar.  We all remember the delight of Mrs. Bungay when the Hon. Percy
650,I.  ON CRITICISM.,Popjoy drives up in a private hansom with an enormous grey cab horse and
651,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"a tiger behind, and Mrs. Bacon is looking out grimly from the window on"
652,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"the opposite side of the street.  ""In the name of commonsense, Mr."
653,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Pendennis,"" Shandon asked, ""what have you been doing--praising one of Mr."
654,I.  ON CRITICISM.,Bacon's books?  Bungay has been with me in a fury this morning at seeing
655,I.  ON CRITICISM.,a laudatory article upon one of the works of the odious firm over the
656,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"way.""  Pen's eyes opened wide with astonishment.  ""Do you mean to say,"""
657,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"he asked, ""that we are to praise no books that Bacon publishes; or that"
658,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"if the books are good we are to say that they are bad?""  Pen says, ""I"
659,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"would rather starve, by Jove, and never earn another penny by my pen,"
660,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"than strike an opponent an unfair blow, or if called upon to place him,"
661,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"rank him below his honest desert."""

663,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"There was a trial in London in December, 1878, which illustrates the"
664,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"subject I am upon.  It was an action for libel by the well-known artist,"
665,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Mr. Whistler, against Mr. Ruskin, the most distinguished art critic of"
666,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"the age.  The passage in the writing of Mr. Ruskin, of which Mr. Whistler"
667,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"complained, contains, I think, almost every fault which, according to my"
668,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"divisions, a criticism can contain.  The passage is as follows:--""For Mr."
669,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Whistler's own sake no less than for the protection of the purchaser, Sir"
670,I.  ON CRITICISM.,Coutts Lindsey ought not to have admitted works into the gallery in which
671,I.  ON CRITICISM.,the ill-educated conceit of the artist so nearly approached the aspect of
672,I.  ON CRITICISM.,wilful imposture.  I have seen and heard much of cockney impudence before
673,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"now, but never expected to hear a coxcomb ask 200 guineas for flinging a"
674,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"pot of paint in the public's face."""
675,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
676,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"The Attorney-General of the day, as counsel for Mr. Ruskin, said that"
677,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"this was a severe and slashing criticism, but perfectly fair and _bona"
678,I.  ON CRITICISM.,fide_.
679,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
680,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Now, let us see.  First, there is the expression, ""the ill-educated"
681,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"conceit of the artist nearly approached the aspect of wilful imposture."""
682,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"That may be severe and slashing, but is it fair?  If there _was_ a wilful"
683,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"imposition, why not say so; but, of course, there was not, and could not"
684,I.  ON CRITICISM.,be; but it is most unfair to insinuate that there nearly was.  The truth
685,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"is, the words ""wilful imposture"" are a gross exaggeration.  The jury,"
686,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"after retiring, came into court and asked the judge what was the meaning"
687,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"of wilful imposture, and, being told that it meant nothing in particular,"
688,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"they returned a verdict of damages one farthing, which meant to say that"
689,I.  ON CRITICISM.,they thought equally little of Whistler's picture and of Ruskin's
690,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"criticism.  Next we come to ""Cockney impudence"" and ""coxcomb.""  Surely"
691,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"these terms must be grossly inappropriate to the subject in hand, which"
692,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"is Whistler's painting, and not his personal qualities.  Next, it seems"
693,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"that Mr. Ruskin thinks it is an offence to ask 200 guineas for a picture,"
694,I.  ON CRITICISM.,but where the offence lies we are not told.  It might be folly to _give_
695,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"200 guineas for one of Whistler's pictures, but why should he be abused"
696,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"for asking it?  The insinuation is that it is a false pretence, and such"
697,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"an insinuation is not _bona fide_.  Lastly, we are told that Mr. Whistler"
698,I.  ON CRITICISM.,has been flinging a pot of paint in the public's face.  In the first
699,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"place, this is vulgar.  In the next place, it is absurd.  When Sydney"
700,I.  ON CRITICISM.,Smith said that someone's writing was like a spider having escaped from
701,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"the inkstand and wandered over the paper, it was an exaggerated"
702,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"criticism, but it was appropriate.  But if Mr. Whistler flung a pot of"
703,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"paint anywhere, it was upon his own canvas, and not into the face of the"
704,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"public.  Now, let anybody think what is the effect of such criticism.  Is"
705,I.  ON CRITICISM.,one enabled by the light of it to see the merits or faults of Whistler's
706,I.  ON CRITICISM.,painting?  And yet this was written by the greatest art critic in this
707,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"country, by the man who has done more to reveal the secrets of Nature and"
708,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"of Art to us all than any man living, and, I had almost said, than any"
709,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"living or dead.  But passion and arrogance are not criticism; and, in the"
710,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"sense in which I have used the term, such criticism is not _bona fide_."
711,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Well may Mr. Matthew Arnold say, speaking of Mr. Ruskin's criticism upon"
712,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"another subject, that he forgets all moderation and proportion, and loses"
713,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"the balance of his mind.  This, he says, ""is to show in one's criticism"
714,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"to the highest excess the note of provinciality."""
715,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
716,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"There was, once upon a time, a very strong Court of Appeal.  It was"
717,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"universally acknowledged to be so, and the memory of it still remains,"
718,I.  ON CRITICISM.,and very old lawyers still love to recall its glories.  It was composed
719,I.  ON CRITICISM.,of Lord Chancellor Campbell and the Lords Justices Knight-Bruce and
720,I.  ON CRITICISM.,Turner.  Bethell (afterwards Lord Westbury) was an ambitious and aspiring
721,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"man, and was always most caustic in his criticisms.  He had been arguing"
722,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"before the above Court one day, and upon his turning round after"
723,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"finishing his argument, some counsel in the row behind him asked, ""Well,"
724,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Bethell, how will their judgment go?""  Bethell replied, in his softest"
725,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"but most cutting tones, ""I do not know.  Knight-Bruce is a jack-pudding."
726,I.  ON CRITICISM.,Turner is an old woman.  And no human being can by any possibility
727,I.  ON CRITICISM.,predict what will fall from the lips of that inexpressibly fatuous
728,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"individual who sits in the middle.""  This is funny, but it is vulgar, and"
729,I.  ON CRITICISM.,it is not given in good faith.  It is the offspring of anger and spite
730,I.  ON CRITICISM.,mixed with a desire to be clever and antithetical.
731,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
732,I.  ON CRITICISM.,I gather from Mr. Matthew Arnold's essays on criticism that the endeavour
733,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"of the critic should be to see the object criticized ""as in itself it"
734,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"really is,"" or as in another passage he says, ""Real criticism obeys an"
735,I.  ON CRITICISM.,instinct prompting it to know the best that is known and thought in the
736,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"world.""  ""In order to do or to be this, criticism,"" he says, in italics,"
737,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"""ought to be _disinterested_.""  He points out how much English criticism"
738,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"is not disinterested.  He says, ""We have the _Edinburgh Review_, existing"
739,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"as an organ of the old Whigs, and for as much play of mind as may suit"
740,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"its being _that_; we have the _Quarterly Review_, existing as an organ of"
741,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"the Tories, and for as much play of mind as may suit its being that; we"
742,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"have the _British Quarterly Review_, existing as an organ of the"
743,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"political Dissenters, and for as much play of mind as may suit its being"
744,I.  ON CRITICISM.,that; we have the _Times_ existing as an organ of the common satisfied
745,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"well-to-do Englishman, and for as much play of mind as may suit its being"
746,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"that. . . .  Directly this play of mind wants to have more scope, and to"
747,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"forget the pressure of practical considerations a little, it is checked,"
748,I.  ON CRITICISM.,it is made to feel the chain.  We saw this the other day in the
749,I.  ON CRITICISM.,extinction so much to be regretted of the _Home and Foreign Review_;
750,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"perhaps in no organ of criticism was there so much knowledge, so much"
751,I.  ON CRITICISM.,play of mind; but these could not save it.  It must needs be that men
752,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"should act in sects and parties, that each of these sects and parties"
753,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"should have its organ, and should make this organ subserve the interest"
754,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"of its action; but it would be well too that there should be a criticism,"
755,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"not the minister of those interests, nor their enemy, but absolutely and"
756,I.  ON CRITICISM.,entirely independent of them.  No other criticism will ever attain any
757,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"real authority, or make any real way towards its end,--the creating a"
758,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"current of true and fresh ideas."""
759,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
760,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"This, it must be remembered, was written in 1865.  Would Mr. Matthew"
761,I.  ON CRITICISM.,Arnold be happier now with the _Fortnightly_ and the _Nineteenth Century_
762,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"and others?  There is, I think, a good deal of truth in the passage I"
763,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"have just quoted.  I think he might have allowed that, among so many"
764,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"writers, each advocating his own view or the view of his party or sect,"
765,I.  ON CRITICISM.,we ought to have some chance of forming a judgment.  A question seems to

768,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"""Set in all lights by many minds"
769,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"To close the interests of all."""
770,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
771,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"But, as I said, there is a good deal in what the writer says.  The _Daily"
772,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"News_ says the Government is all wrong, and the _Daily Telegraph_ says it"
773,I.  ON CRITICISM.,is all right; and if any paper ventured to be moderate it would go to the
774,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"wall in a week.  I think what he says is true, but there is no occasion"
775,I.  ON CRITICISM.,to be so angry about it.  We really are very thankful for such men as
776,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Carlyle, Ruskin, and Matthew Arnold, and I can't help thinking they have"
777,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"had their proper share of praise, and have had their share of influence"
778,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"upon their age.  The air of neglected superiority, which they assume,"
779,I.  ON CRITICISM.,detracts not a little from the pleasure with which one always reads them.
780,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
781,I.  ON CRITICISM.,Perhaps some of my conservative friends will regret the good old times in
782,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"which criticism was really criticism, when a book had to run the gauntlet"
783,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"of a few well established critics of _the_ club, or a play was applauded"
784,I.  ON CRITICISM.,or damned by a select few in the front row of the pit.  I agree to lament
785,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"a past which can never return, but, on the whole, I think we are the"
786,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"gainers.  Also, I very much incline to think that the standard of"
787,I.  ON CRITICISM.,criticism is higher now than in the very palmy days when Addison wrote;
788,I.  ON CRITICISM.,or when the _Edinburgh_ or _Quarterly_ were first started.  I incline to
789,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"agree with Leslie Stephen in his _Hours in a Library_, that, if most of"
790,I.  ON CRITICISM.,the critical articles of even Jeffrey and Mackintosh were submitted to a
791,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"modern editor, he would reject them as inadequate; but I think that"
792,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"perhaps they excel our modern efforts in a certain reserve and dignity,"
793,I.  ON CRITICISM.,and in a more matured thoughtfulness.
794,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
795,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"If criticism is an art, such as I have described it, and is subject to"
796,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"certain rules and conditions; if good criticism is appreciative,"
797,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"proportionate, appropriate, strong, natural, and _bona fide_, and bad"
798,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"criticism is the reverse of all this, why, you will ask, cannot the art"
799,I.  ON CRITICISM.,be taught by some School or Academy; and if criticism is so important a
800,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"matter as you say, surely the State might see to it?  I must own I am"
801,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"against it.  Mr. Matthew Arnold, who is much in favour of founding an"
802,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"academy, which is not only to judge of original works but of the"
803,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"criticisms of others upon them, states the matter very fairly.  He says,"
804,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"""So far as routine and authority tend to embarrass energy and inventive"
805,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"genius, academies may be said to be obstructive to energy and inventive"
806,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"genius; and, to this extent, to the human spirit's general advance.  But"
807,I.  ON CRITICISM.,then this evil is so much compensated by the propagation on a large scale
808,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"of the mental aptitudes and demands, which an open mind and a flexible"
809,I.  ON CRITICISM.,intelligence naturally engender; genius itself in the long run so greatly
810,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"finds its account in this propagation, and bodies like the French Academy"
811,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"have such power for promoting it, that the general advance of the human"
812,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"spirit is perhaps, on the whole, rather furthered than impeded by their"
813,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"existence."""
814,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
815,I.  ON CRITICISM.,But I do not accede to this opinion.  It is under the free open air of
816,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"heaven, in the wild woods and the meadows that the loveliest and sweetest"
817,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"flowers bloom, and not in the trim gardens or the hot-houses, and even in"
818,I.  ON CRITICISM.,our gardens in England we strive to preserve some lingering traits of the
819,I.  ON CRITICISM.,open country.  I believe that just as the gift of freedom to the masses
820,I.  ON CRITICISM.,of our countrymen teaches them to use that freedom with care and
821,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"intelligence, just as the abolition of tests and oaths makes men loyal"
822,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"and trustworthy, so it is well to have freedom in literature and"
823,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"criticism.  Mistakes will be made and mischief done, but in the long run"
824,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"the effect of a keen competition, and an advancing public taste will"
825,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"tell.  I don't hesitate to assert, without fear of contradiction, that"
826,I.  ON CRITICISM.,critical art has improved rapidly during the last twenty years in this
827,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"country, where a man is free to start a critical review, and to write"
828,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"about anybody, or anything, and in any manner, provided he keeps within"
829,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"the law.  He is only restrained by the competition of others, and by the"
830,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"public taste, which are both constantly increasing.  No doubt an author"
831,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"will write with greater spirit, and with greater decorum, if he knows"
832,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"that his merits are sure to be fairly acknowledged, and his faults"
833,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"certain to be accurately noted.  But this object may be attained, I"
834,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"believe, without an academy.  On the other hand, what danger there is in"
835,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"an academy becoming cliquey, nay even corrupt.  We have an academy here"
836,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"in the painting art, but except that it collects within its walls every"
837,I.  ON CRITICISM.,year a vaster number of daubs than it is possible for any one ever to see
838,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"with any degree of comfort, I don't know what particular use it is of.  As"
839,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"a school or college it may be of use, but as a critical academy it does"
840,I.  ON CRITICISM.,very little.
841,I.  ON CRITICISM.,
842,I.  ON CRITICISM.,I have thus endeavoured to show what I mean by my six divisions of
843,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"criticism, and I have no doubt you will all of you have divined that my"
844,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"six divisions are capable of being expressed in one word, Criticism must"
845,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"be _true_.  To be true, it must be appreciative, or understanding, it"
846,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"must be in due proportion, it must be appropriate, it must be strong, it"
847,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"must be natural, it must be _bona fide_.  There is nothing which an"
848,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"Englishman hates so much as being false.  Our great modern poet, in one"
849,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"of his strongest lines, says--"
850,I.  ON CRITICISM.,

867,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"speak or write it when required, we should get rid of a great deal of bad"

869,I.  ON CRITICISM.,am further certain that by constantly uttering false criticisms we
870,I.  ON CRITICISM.,perpetuate such things.  And what harm we are doing to our own selves in

877,I.  ON CRITICISM.,comparable to the standing upon the vantage ground of truth (a hill not
878,I.  ON CRITICISM.,to be commanded and where the air is always clear and serene) and to see
879,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"the errors and wanderings and mists and tempests in the vale below, so"

884,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"In conclusion, I am aware that I have treated the subject most"
885,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"inadequately, and that others have treated the same subject with much"
886,I.  ON CRITICISM.,more power; but I am satisfied of the great importance of a right use of
887,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"the critical faculty, and I think it may be that my mode of treatment may"
888,I.  ON CRITICISM.,arrest the attention of some minds which are apt to be frightened at a
889,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"learned method, and may induce them to take more heed of the judgments"
890,I.  ON CRITICISM.,which they are hourly passing on a great variety of subjects.  If we
891,I.  ON CRITICISM.,still persist in saying when some one jingles some jig upon the piano
892,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"that it is ""charming,"" if we say of every daub in the Academy that it is"
893,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"""lovely,"" if every new building or statue is pronounced ""awfully jolly,"""
894,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"if the fastidious rubbish of the last volume of poetry is ""grand,"" if the"
895,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"slip-shod grammar of the last new novel is ""quite sweet,"" when shall we"
896,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"see an end of these bad things?  And observe further, these bad things"
897,I.  ON CRITICISM.,live on and affect the human mind for ever.  Bad things are born of bad.
898,I.  ON CRITICISM.,Who can tell what may be the effect of seeing day by day an hideous
899,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"building, of hearing day by day indifferent music, of constantly reading"
900,I.  ON CRITICISM.,a lot of feeble twaddle?  Surely one effect will be that we shall
901,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"gradually lose our appreciation of what is good and beautiful.  ""A thing"
902,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"of beauty is a joy for ever.""  Ah! but we must have eyes to see it.  This"
903,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"springtime is lovely, if we have the eyes to see it; but, if we have not,"
904,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"its loveliness is nothing to us, and if we miss seeing it we shall have"
905,I.  ON CRITICISM.,dimmer eyes to see it next year and the next; and if we cannot now see
906,I.  ON CRITICISM.,"beauty and truth through the glass darkly, we shall be unable to gaze on"

914,II.  ON LUXURY.,An eminent lawyer of my acquaintance had a Socratic habit of interrupting
915,II.  ON LUXURY.,"the conversation by saying, ""Let us understand one another: when you say"
916,II.  ON LUXURY.,"so-and-so, do you mean so-and-so, or something quite different?""  Now,"
917,II.  ON LUXURY.,although it is intolerable that the natural flow of social intercourse
918,II.  ON LUXURY.,"should be thus impeded, yet in writing a paper to be laid before a"
919,II.  ON LUXURY.,learned and fastidious society one is bound to let one's hearers a little
920,II.  ON LUXURY.,"into the secret, and to state fairly what the subject of the essay really"
921,II.  ON LUXURY.,"is.  I suppose we shall all admit that bad luxury is bad, and good luxury"
922,II.  ON LUXURY.,"is good, unless the phrase good luxury is a contradiction in terms.  We"
923,II.  ON LUXURY.,"must try to avoid disputing about words.  The word luxury, according to"
924,II.  ON LUXURY.,"its derivation, signifies an extravagant and outrageous indulgence of the"
925,II.  ON LUXURY.,"appetites or desires.  If we take this as the meaning of the word, we"
926,II.  ON LUXURY.,shall agree that luxury is bad; but if we take luxury to be only another
927,II.  ON LUXURY.,"name for the refinements of civilization, we shall all approve of it.  But"
928,II.  ON LUXURY.,"the real and substantial question is not what the word means, but, what"
929,II.  ON LUXURY.,is that thing which we all agree is bad or good; where does the bad begin
930,II.  ON LUXURY.,and the good end; how are we to discern the difference; and how are we to
931,II.  ON LUXURY.,"avoid the one and embrace the other.  In this essay, therefore, I intend"
932,II.  ON LUXURY.,to use the word luxury to denote that indulgence which interferes with
933,II.  ON LUXURY.,"the full and proper exercise of all the faculties, powers, tastes, and"
934,II.  ON LUXURY.,"whatever is good and worthy in a man.  Enjoyments, relaxations, delights,"
935,II.  ON LUXURY.,"indulgences which are beneficial, I do not denominate ""luxury.""  All"
936,II.  ON LUXURY.,indulgences which fit us for our duties are good; all which tend to unfit
937,II.  ON LUXURY.,us for them are bad; and these latter I call luxuries.  Some one will
938,II.  ON LUXURY.,"say, perhaps, that some indulgences are merely indifferent, and produce"
939,II.  ON LUXURY.,no appreciable effect upon body or mind; and it might be enough to
940,II.  ON LUXURY.,"dismiss such things with the maxim, ""_de minimis non curat lex_.""  But"
941,II.  ON LUXURY.,"the doctrine is dangerous, and I doubt if anything in this world is"
942,II.  ON LUXURY.,absolutely immaterial.  De Quincey mentions the case of a man who
943,II.  ON LUXURY.,"committed a murder, which at the time he thought little about, but he was"
944,II.  ON LUXURY.,led on from that to gambling and Sabbath breaking.  Probably in this
945,II.  ON LUXURY.,weary world any indulgence or pleasure which is not bad is not
946,II.  ON LUXURY.,"indifferent, but absolutely good.  The world is not so bright, so"
947,II.  ON LUXURY.,"comfortable, so pleasant, that we can afford to scorn the good the gods"
948,II.  ON LUXURY.,"provide us.  In Mr. Reade's book on _Study and Stimulants_, Matthew"
949,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Arnold says, a moderate use of wine adds to the agreeableness of life,"
950,II.  ON LUXURY.,"and whatever adds to the agreeableness of life, adds to its resources and"
951,II.  ON LUXURY.,powers.  There cannot be a doubt that the bodily frame is capable of
952,II.  ON LUXURY.,"being wearied, and that it needs repose and refreshment, and this is a"
953,II.  ON LUXURY.,law which a man trifles with at his peril.  The same is true of the
954,II.  ON LUXURY.,intellectual and moral faculties.  They claim rest and refreshment; they
955,II.  ON LUXURY.,must have comfort and pleasure or they will begin to flag.  It must also
956,II.  ON LUXURY.,be always remembered that in the every-day work of this world the body
957,II.  ON LUXURY.,and the mind have to go through a great deal which is depressing and
958,II.  ON LUXURY.,"taxing to the energy, and a certain amount of ""set off"" is required to"
959,II.  ON LUXURY.,keep the balance even.  We must remember this especially with respect to
960,II.  ON LUXURY.,"the poor.  Pipes and cigars may be a luxury to the idle and rich, but we"
961,II.  ON LUXURY.,ought not to grudge a pipe to a poor man who is overworked and miserable.
962,II.  ON LUXURY.,Some degree of comfort we all feel to be at times essential when we have
963,II.  ON LUXURY.,"a comfortless task to perform.  With good food and sleep, for instance,"
964,II.  ON LUXURY.,we can get through the roughest work; with the relaxation of pleasant
965,II.  ON LUXURY.,"society we can do the most tedious daily work.  If, on the other hand, we"
966,II.  ON LUXURY.,"are worried and uncomfortable, we become unfitted for our business.  We"
967,II.  ON LUXURY.,"all have our troubles to contend against, and we require comfort,"
968,II.  ON LUXURY.,"relaxation, stimulation of some sort to help us in the battle.  There are"
969,II.  ON LUXURY.,"certain duties which most of us have to perform, and which, to use a"
970,II.  ON LUXURY.,"common expression, ""take it out of us.""  Thus most of us are compelled to"
971,II.  ON LUXURY.,travel more or less.  An old gentleman travelling by coach on a long
972,II.  ON LUXURY.,"journey wished to sleep off the tediousness of the night, but his"
973,II.  ON LUXURY.,"travelling companion woke him up every ten minutes with the inquiry,"
974,II.  ON LUXURY.,"""Well, sir, how are you by this.""  At last the old gentleman's patience"
975,II.  ON LUXURY.,"was fairly tired out.  ""I was very well when I got into the coach, and"
976,II.  ON LUXURY.,"I'm very well now, and if any change takes place I'll let you know.""  I"
977,II.  ON LUXURY.,"was coming from London to Beckenham, and in the carriage with me was a"
978,II.  ON LUXURY.,gentleman quietly and attentively reading the newspaper.  A lady opposite
979,II.  ON LUXURY.,"to him, whenever we came to a station, cried out, ""Oh, what station's"
980,II.  ON LUXURY.,"this, what station's this?""  Being told, she subsided, more or less, till"
981,II.  ON LUXURY.,"the next station.  The gentleman's patience was at last exhausted.  ""If"
982,II.  ON LUXURY.,there is any _particular_ station at which you wish to alight I will
983,II.  ON LUXURY.,"inform you when we arrive."""
984,II.  ON LUXURY.,
985,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Such are some of the annoying circumstances of travel.  Then, at the end"
986,II.  ON LUXURY.,"of the journey, are we sure of a comfortable night's rest?  It was a rule"
987,II.  ON LUXURY.,upon circuit that the barristers arriving at an inn had the choice of
988,II.  ON LUXURY.,"bedrooms according to seniority, and woe betide the junior who dared to"
989,II.  ON LUXURY.,infringe the rule and endeavour to secure by force or fraud the best
990,II.  ON LUXURY.,"bedroom.  The leaders, who had the hardest work to do, required the best"
991,II.  ON LUXURY.,night's rest.  A party of barristers arrived late one night at their
992,II.  ON LUXURY.,"accustomed inn, a half-way house to the next assize town, and found one"
993,II.  ON LUXURY.,of the best bedrooms already occupied.  They were told by some wag that
994,II.  ON LUXURY.,it was occupied by a young man just joined the circuit.  There was a rush
995,II.  ON LUXURY.,to the bedroom.  The culprit was dragged out of bed and deposited on the
996,II.  ON LUXURY.,floor.  A venerable old gentleman in a nightcap and gown addressed the
997,II.  ON LUXURY.,"ringleader of his assailants, Serjeant Golbourne, ""Brother Golbourne,"
998,II.  ON LUXURY.,"brother Golbourne, is this the way to treat a Christian judge?""  I should"
999,II.  ON LUXURY.,not have liked to have been one of those who had to conduct a cause
1000,II.  ON LUXURY.,"before him next day.  Who can be generous, benevolent, kindly, and even-"
1001,II.  ON LUXURY.,tempered if one is to be subjected to such harassing details as I have
1002,II.  ON LUXURY.,above narrated? and I have no doubt that a fair amount of comfort is
1003,II.  ON LUXURY.,necessary to the exercise of the Christian virtues.  I am not at all sure
1004,II.  ON LUXURY.,"that pilgrims prayed any better because they had peas in their shoes, and"
1005,II.  ON LUXURY.,it is well known that soldiers fight best when they are well fed.  A
1006,II.  ON LUXURY.,"certain amount of comfort and pleasure is good for us, and is refreshing"
1007,II.  ON LUXURY.,"to body and spirit.  Such things, for instance, as the bath in the"
1008,II.  ON LUXURY.,morning; the cup of warm tea or coffee for breakfast; the glass of beer
1009,II.  ON LUXURY.,or wine and variety of food at dinner; the rest or nap in the arm-chair
1010,II.  ON LUXURY.,or sofa; an occasional novel; the pipe before going to bed; the change of
1011,II.  ON LUXURY.,dress; music or light reading in the evening; even the night-cap
1012,II.  ON LUXURY.,recommended by Mr. Banting; games of chance or skill; dancing;--surely
1013,II.  ON LUXURY.,"such things may renovate, soothe, and render more elastic and vigorous"
1014,II.  ON LUXURY.,both body and mind.
1015,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1016,II.  ON LUXURY.,"While, therefore, I have admitted fully that we all require ""sweetness"
1017,II.  ON LUXURY.,"and light,"" that some indulgence is necessary for the renovation of our"
1018,II.  ON LUXURY.,wearied souls and bodies; yet it very often will happen that the thing in
1019,II.  ON LUXURY.,"which we desire to indulge does not tend at all in this direction, or it"
1020,II.  ON LUXURY.,"may be that, although a moderate indulgence does so tend, an immoderate"
1021,II.  ON LUXURY.,"use has precisely the reverse effect.  My subject, therefore, divides"
1022,II.  ON LUXURY.,"itself, firstly, into a consideration of those luxuries which are _per"
1023,II.  ON LUXURY.,"se_ deleterious, and those which are so only by excessive use."
1024,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1025,II.  ON LUXURY.,I suppose you will not be surprised to hear that I think we are in
1026,II.  ON LUXURY.,"danger, in the upper and middle classes at all events, of going far"
1027,II.  ON LUXURY.,beyond the point where pleasures and indulgences tend to the improvement
1028,II.  ON LUXURY.,of body and mind.  Surely there are many of us who can remember when the
1029,II.  ON LUXURY.,habits of our fathers were less luxurious than they are now.  In a
1030,II.  ON LUXURY.,"leading article in a newspaper not long ago the writer said, ""All classes"
1031,II.  ON LUXURY.,without exception spend too much on what may be called luxuries.  A very
1032,II.  ON LUXURY.,marked change in this respect has been noticed by every one who studies
1033,II.  ON LUXURY.,the movements of society.  Among people whose fathers regarded champagne
1034,II.  ON LUXURY.,"as a devout Aryan might have regarded the Soma juice--viz., as a beverage"
1035,II.  ON LUXURY.,reserved for the gods and for millionaires--the foaming grape of Eastern
1036,II.  ON LUXURY.,"France is now habitually consumed. . . .""  He goes on, ""The luxuries of"
1037,II.  ON LUXURY.,"the poor are few, and chiefly consist of too much beer, and of little"
1038,II.  ON LUXURY.,occasional dainties.  What pleasures but the grossest does the State
1039,II.  ON LUXURY.,"provide for the artisan's leisure?""  ""It does not do,"" says the writer,"
1040,II.  ON LUXURY.,"""to be hard upon them, but it is undeniable that this excess of"
1041,II.  ON LUXURY.,"expenditure on what in no sense profits them is enormous in the mass."""
1042,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1043,II.  ON LUXURY.,Not long ago a great outcry was heard about the extravagance and luxury
1044,II.  ON LUXURY.,"of the working man.  It was stated often, and certainly not without"
1045,II.  ON LUXURY.,"foundation, that the best of everything in the markets in the way of food"
1046,II.  ON LUXURY.,was bought at the highest prices by workmen or their wives; and although
1047,II.  ON LUXURY.,"the champagne was not perhaps so very freely indulged in, nor so pure as"
1048,II.  ON LUXURY.,"might be wished, yet, that the working men indulged themselves in more"
1049,II.  ON LUXURY.,"drink than was good for their stomachs, and in more expensive drinks than"
1050,II.  ON LUXURY.,"was good for their purses, no man can doubt."
1051,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1052,II.  ON LUXURY.,"If this increase of luxury is observable in the lower classes, how much"
1053,II.  ON LUXURY.,more easily can it be discerned in the middle classes.  Take for instance
1054,II.  ON LUXURY.,the pleasures of the table.  I do not speak of great entertainments or
1055,II.  ON LUXURY.,"life in palaces or great houses, which do not so much vary from one age"
1056,II.  ON LUXURY.,"to another, but of the ordinary life of people like ourselves.  Spenser"
1057,II.  ON LUXURY.,says:--
1058,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1059,II.  ON LUXURY.,"""The antique world excess and pryde did hate,"
1060,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Such proud luxurious pomp is swollen up of late."""
1061,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1062,II.  ON LUXURY.,How many more dishes and how many more wines do we put on the table than
1063,II.  ON LUXURY.,our ancestors afforded.  Pope writes of Balaam's housekeeping:--
1064,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1065,II.  ON LUXURY.,"""A single dish the week day meal affords,"
1066,II.  ON LUXURY.,"An added pudding solemnized the Lord's."""
1067,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1068,II.  ON LUXURY.,Then when he became rich:--
1069,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1070,II.  ON LUXURY.,"""Live like yourself was soon my lady's word,"
1071,II.  ON LUXURY.,"And lo, two puddings smoked upon the board!"""
1072,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1073,II.  ON LUXURY.,Then his description of his own table is worth noting:--
1074,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1075,II.  ON LUXURY.,"""Content with little, I can manage here"
1076,II.  ON LUXURY.,"On brocoli and mutton round the year,"
1077,II.  ON LUXURY.,"'Tis true no turbots dignify my boards,"
1078,II.  ON LUXURY.,"But gudgeons, flounders, what my Thames affords."
1079,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1080,II.  ON LUXURY.,"To Hounslow Heath I point, and Banstead Down;"
1081,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Thence comes your mutton, and these chicks my own,"
1082,II.  ON LUXURY.,"From yon old walnut tree a show'r shall fall,"
1083,II.  ON LUXURY.,"And grapes, long lingering on my only wall,"
1084,II.  ON LUXURY.,And figs from standard and espalier join--
1085,II.  ON LUXURY.,"The deuce is in you if you cannot dine."""
1086,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1087,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Now, however, the whole world is put under contribution to supply our"
1088,II.  ON LUXURY.,"daily meals, and the palate is being constantly stimulated, and in some"
1089,II.  ON LUXURY.,degree impaired by a variety of food and wine.  And I am sure that the
1090,II.  ON LUXURY.,effect of this is to produce a distaste for wholesome food.  I daresay we
1091,II.  ON LUXURY.,"have all heard of the Scotchman who had drunk too much whisky.  He said,"
1092,II.  ON LUXURY.,"""I can't drink water; it turns sae acid on the stomach.""  This increase"
1093,II.  ON LUXURY.,"of the luxuries of the table, beyond what was the habit of our fathers,"
1094,II.  ON LUXURY.,"is shown chiefly, I think, when we are at home and alone; but if one is"
1095,II.  ON LUXURY.,"visiting or entertaining others, how often is one perfectly bored by the"
1096,II.  ON LUXURY.,quantity of food and drink which is handed round.  Things in season and
1097,II.  ON LUXURY.,"out of season, perhaps ill assorted, ill cooked, cold, and calculated to"
1098,II.  ON LUXURY.,"make one extremely ill, but no doubt costing a great deal of money, time,"
1099,II.  ON LUXURY.,"and anxiety to the givers of the feast.  Then we fall to grumbling, and"
1100,II.  ON LUXURY.,"are discontented with having too much, but having acquired a habit of"
1101,II.  ON LUXURY.,expecting it we grumble still more if there is not as much as usual
1102,II.  ON LUXURY.,provided.

1167,II.  ON LUXURY.,clubs.  They are the very hotbed of luxury.  By merely asking for it you
1168,II.  ON LUXURY.,obtain almost anything you require in the way of luxury.  I am aware that
1169,II.  ON LUXURY.,"many men at clubs live more carefully and frugally, but I am aware also"
1170,II.  ON LUXURY.,that a great many acquire habits of self-indulgence which produce
1171,II.  ON LUXURY.,idleness and selfish indifference to the wants of others.  In a still
1172,II.  ON LUXURY.,"more pernicious fashion, I think that refreshment bars at railway"
1173,II.  ON LUXURY.,stations minister to luxury; at least I am sure they foster a habit of
1174,II.  ON LUXURY.,"drinking more than is necessary, or desirable; and that is one form of"
1175,II.  ON LUXURY.,"luxury, and a very bad one.  The fellows of a Camford college are"
1176,II.  ON LUXURY.,reported to have met on one occasion and voted that we do sell our chapel
1177,II.  ON LUXURY.,"organ; and the next motion, carried _nem. con_., was that we do have a"
1178,II.  ON LUXURY.,dinner.  As to ornaments for the dinner table what affectation and
1179,II.  ON LUXURY.,"expense do we see.  But in the days of Walpole it was not amiss.  ""The"
1180,II.  ON LUXURY.,last branch of our fashion into which the close observation of nature has
1181,II.  ON LUXURY.,"been introduced is our desserts.  Jellies, biscuits, sugar plums, and"
1182,II.  ON LUXURY.,"creams have long since given way to harlequins, gondoliers, Turks,"
1183,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Chinese, and shepherdesses of Saxon china.  Meadows of cattle spread"
1184,II.  ON LUXURY.,"themselves over the table.  Cottages in sugar, and temples in barley"
1185,II.  ON LUXURY.,"sugar, pigmy Neptunes in cars of cockle shells trampling over oceans of"
1186,II.  ON LUXURY.,looking glass or seas of silver tissue.  Gigantic figures succeed to
1187,II.  ON LUXURY.,"pigmies; and it is known that a celebrated confectioner complained that,"
1188,II.  ON LUXURY.,after having prepared a middle dish of gods and goddesses eighteen feet
1189,II.  ON LUXURY.,"high, his lord would not cause the ceiling of his parlour to be"
1190,II.  ON LUXURY.,"demolished to facilitate their entree.  ""_Imaginez-vous_,"" said he, ""_que"
1191,II.  ON LUXURY.,"milord n'a pas vouler faire oter le plafond_!"""
1192,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1193,II.  ON LUXURY.,To show how much luxurious living has increased during the present
1194,II.  ON LUXURY.,century I propose to quote a portion of that wonderfully brilliant third
1195,II.  ON LUXURY.,chapter of Macaulay's _England_ which we all know.  Speaking of the
1196,II.  ON LUXURY.,"squire of former days, he says, ""His chief serious employment was the"
1197,II.  ON LUXURY.,"care of his property.  He examined samples of grain, handled pigs, and,"
1198,II.  ON LUXURY.,"on market days, made bargains over a tankard with drovers and hop"
1199,II.  ON LUXURY.,merchants.  His chief pleasures were commonly derived from field sports
1200,II.  ON LUXURY.,and from an unrefined sensuality.  His language and pronunciation were
1201,II.  ON LUXURY.,such as we should now expect to hear only from the most ignorant clowns.
1202,II.  ON LUXURY.,"His oaths, coarse jests, and scurrilous terms of abuse were uttered with"
1203,II.  ON LUXURY.,the broadest accent of his province.  It was easy to discern from the
1204,II.  ON LUXURY.,first words which he spoke whether he came from Somersetshire or
1205,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Yorkshire.  He troubled himself little about decorating his abode, and,"
1206,II.  ON LUXURY.,"if he attempted decoration, seldom produced anything but deformity.  The"
1207,II.  ON LUXURY.,"litter of a farm-yard gathered under the windows of his bed-chamber, and"
1208,II.  ON LUXURY.,the cabbages and gooseberry bushes grew close to his hall door.  His
1209,II.  ON LUXURY.,table was loaded with coarse plenty; and guests were cordially welcomed
1210,II.  ON LUXURY.,to it.  But as the habit of drinking to excess was general in the class
1211,II.  ON LUXURY.,"to which he belonged, and as his fortune did not enable him to intoxicate"
1212,II.  ON LUXURY.,"large assemblies daily with claret or canary, strong beer was the"
1213,II.  ON LUXURY.,ordinary beverage.  The quantity of beer consumed in those days was
1214,II.  ON LUXURY.,indeed enormous.  For beer was then to the middle and lower classes not
1215,II.  ON LUXURY.,"only what beer is now, but all that wine, tea, and ardent spirits now"
1216,II.  ON LUXURY.,are.  It was only at great houses or on great occasions that foreign
1217,II.  ON LUXURY.,"drink was placed on the board.  The ladies of the house, whose business"
1218,II.  ON LUXURY.,"it had commonly been to cook the repast, retired as soon as the dishes"
1219,II.  ON LUXURY.,"were devoured, and left the gentlemen to their ale and tobacco.  The"
1220,II.  ON LUXURY.,coarse jollity of the afternoon was often prolonged till the revellers
1221,II.  ON LUXURY.,"were laid under the table."""
1222,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1223,II.  ON LUXURY.,I quote again from another portion of the same chapter in
1224,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Macaulay:--""Slate has succeeded to thatch, and brick to timber.  The"
1225,II.  ON LUXURY.,"pavements and the lamps, the display of wealth in the principal shops,"
1226,II.  ON LUXURY.,"and the luxurious neatness of the dwellings occupied by the gentry,"
1227,II.  ON LUXURY.,"would, in the seventeenth century, have seemed miraculous.""  Speaking of"
1228,II.  ON LUXURY.,"watering-places he says:--""The gentry of Derbyshire and of the"
1229,II.  ON LUXURY.,"neighbouring counties repaired to Buxton, where they were crowded into"
1230,II.  ON LUXURY.,"low wooden sheds and regaled with oatcake, and with a viand which the"
1231,II.  ON LUXURY.,"hosts called mutton, but which the guests strongly suspected to be dog."""
1232,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Of Tunbridge Wells he says--""At present we see there a town which would,"
1233,II.  ON LUXURY.,"a hundred and sixty years ago, have ranked in population fourth or fifth"
1234,II.  ON LUXURY.,among the towns in England.  The brilliancy of the shops and the luxury
1235,II.  ON LUXURY.,of the private dwellings far surpasses anything that England could then
1236,II.  ON LUXURY.,"show.""  At Bath ""the poor patients to whom the waters had been"
1237,II.  ON LUXURY.,"recommended, lay on straw in a place which, to use the language of a"
1238,II.  ON LUXURY.,"contemporary physician, was a covert rather than a lodging.  As to the"
1239,II.  ON LUXURY.,comforts and luxuries to be found in the interior of the houses at Bath
1240,II.  ON LUXURY.,by the fashionable visitors who resorted thither in search of health and
1241,II.  ON LUXURY.,"amusement, we possess information more complete and minute than generally"
1242,II.  ON LUXURY.,can be obtained on such subjects.  A writer assures us that in his
1243,II.  ON LUXURY.,younger days the gentlemen who visited the springs slept in rooms hardly
1244,II.  ON LUXURY.,as good as the garrets which he lived to see occupied by footmen.  The
1245,II.  ON LUXURY.,"floors of the dining-room were uncarpeted, and were coloured brown with a"
1246,II.  ON LUXURY.,wash made of soot and small beer in order to hide the dirt.  Not a
1247,II.  ON LUXURY.,wainscot was painted.  Not a hearth or chimney piece was of marble.  A
1248,II.  ON LUXURY.,"slab of common freestone, and fire-irons which had cost from three to"
1249,II.  ON LUXURY.,"four shillings, were thought sufficient for any fireplace.  The best"
1250,II.  ON LUXURY.,"apartments were hung with coarse woollen stuff, and were furnished with"
1251,II.  ON LUXURY.,"rush-bottomed chairs."""
1252,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1253,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Of London Macaulay says:--""The town did not, as now, fade by"
1254,II.  ON LUXURY.,"imperceptible degrees into the country.  No long avenues of villas,"
1255,II.  ON LUXURY.,"embowered in lilacs and laburnum, extended from the great source of"
1256,II.  ON LUXURY.,"wealth and civilization almost to the boundaries of Middlesex, and far"
1257,II.  ON LUXURY.,"into the heart of Kent and Surrey.""  In short, there was nothing like the"
1258,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Avenue and the Fox Grove, Beckenham, in old times, and we who live there"
1259,II.  ON LUXURY.,"ought to be immensely grateful for our undeserved blessings.  ""At"
1260,II.  ON LUXURY.,"present,"" he says, ""the bankers, the merchants, and the chief shopkeepers"
1261,II.  ON LUXURY.,repair to the city on six mornings of every week for the transaction of
1262,II.  ON LUXURY.,business; but they reside in other quarters of the metropolis or suburban
1263,II.  ON LUXURY.,"country seats, surrounded by shrubberies and flower gardens.""  Again, ""If"
1264,II.  ON LUXURY.,"the most fashionable parts of the capital could be placed before us, such"
1265,II.  ON LUXURY.,"as they then were, we should be disgusted by their squalid appearance,"
1266,II.  ON LUXURY.,and poisoned by their noisome atmosphere.  In Covent Garden a filthy and
1267,II.  ON LUXURY.,noisy market was held close to the dwellings of the great.  Fruit women
1268,II.  ON LUXURY.,"screamed, carters fought, cabbage stalks and rotten apples accumulated in"
1269,II.  ON LUXURY.,heaps at the thresholds of the Countess of Berkshire and of the Bishop of
1270,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Durham."""
1271,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1272,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Well, you will say, all this proves what a vast improvement we have"
1273,II.  ON LUXURY.,achieved.  Yes; but we must remember that Macaulay was writing on that
1274,II.  ON LUXURY.,"side of the question.  Are we not more self-indulgent, more fond of our"
1275,II.  ON LUXURY.,"flowers, villas, carriages, etc., than we need be; less hard working and"
1276,II.  ON LUXURY.,industrious; more desirous of getting the means of indulgence by some
1277,II.  ON LUXURY.,"short and ready way--by speculation, gambling, and shady, if not"
1278,II.  ON LUXURY.,dishonest dealing--than our fathers were?  I need not follow at further
1279,II.  ON LUXURY.,length Macaulay's description of these earlier times--of the black
1280,II.  ON LUXURY.,"rivulets roaring down Ludgate Hill, filled with the animal and vegetable"
1281,II.  ON LUXURY.,"filth from the stalls of butchers and greengrocers, profusely thrown to"
1282,II.  ON LUXURY.,right and left upon the foot-passengers upon the narrow pavements; the
1283,II.  ON LUXURY.,garret windows opened and pails emptied upon the heads below; thieves
1284,II.  ON LUXURY.,"prowling about the dark streets at night, amid constant rioting and"
1285,II.  ON LUXURY.,"drunkenness; the difficulties and discomforts of travelling, when the"
1286,II.  ON LUXURY.,carriages stuck fast in the quagmires; the travellers attacked by
1287,II.  ON LUXURY.,"highwaymen.  He narrates how it took Prince George of Denmark, who"
1288,II.  ON LUXURY.,"visited Petworth in wet weather, six hours to go nine miles.  Compare"
1289,II.  ON LUXURY.,this to a journey in a first-class carriage or Pullman car upon the
1290,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Midland Railway, and think of the luxuries demanded by the traveller on"
1291,II.  ON LUXURY.,his journey if he is going to travel for more than two or three hours:
1292,II.  ON LUXURY.,"the dinner, the coffee, the cigar, the newspaper and magazine, etc., etc."
1293,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1294,II.  ON LUXURY.,There is a passage in the beginning of _Tom Brown's School Days_ in which
1295,II.  ON LUXURY.,"the author ridicules the quantity of great coats, wrappers, and rugs"
1296,II.  ON LUXURY.,"which a modern schoolboy takes with him, though he is going to travel"
1297,II.  ON LUXURY.,"first class, with foot-warmers.  Then, in our houses, what stoves and hot-"
1298,II.  ON LUXURY.,"water pipes and baths do we not require!  How many soaps and powders,"
1299,II.  ON LUXURY.,"rough towels and soft towels!  Sir Charles Napier, I think, said that all"
1300,II.  ON LUXURY.,"an officer wanted to take with him on a campaign was a towel, a tooth-"
1301,II.  ON LUXURY.,"brush, and a piece of yellow soap.  The great excuse for the bath is that"
1302,II.  ON LUXURY.,"if it is warm it is cleansing; if it is cold, it is invigorating; but"
1303,II.  ON LUXURY.,what shall we say to Turkish Baths?  Surely there is more time wasted
1304,II.  ON LUXURY.,"than enough, and, unless as a medical cure, it may become an idle habit."
1305,II.  ON LUXURY.,I have seen private Turkish Baths in private houses.  What are we coming
1306,II.  ON LUXURY.,"to?  We used to be proud of our ordinary wash-hand basins, and make fun"
1307,II.  ON LUXURY.,of the little saucers that we found provided for our ablutions upon the
1308,II.  ON LUXURY.,Continent.  At the time of the great Exhibition of 1851 _Punch_ had a
1309,II.  ON LUXURY.,picture of two very grimy Frenchmen regarding with wonder an ordinary
1310,II.  ON LUXURY.,"English wash-stand.  ""_Comment appelle-t'on cette machine la_,"" says one;"
1311,II.  ON LUXURY.,"to which the other replies, ""_Je ne sais pas_, _mais c'est drole_.""  A"
1312,II.  ON LUXURY.,great advance has been made in the furniture of our houses.  We fill our
1313,II.  ON LUXURY.,"rooms, especially our drawing-rooms or boudoirs, with endless arm-chairs"
1314,II.  ON LUXURY.,and sofas of various shapes--all designed to give repose to the limbs;
1315,II.  ON LUXURY.,"but I am sure they tend towards lazy habits, and very often interfere"
1316,II.  ON LUXURY.,with work.  Surely there has lately risen a custom of overdoing the
1317,II.  ON LUXURY.,embellishment and ornamentation of our houses.  We fill our rooms too
1318,II.  ON LUXURY.,"full of all sorts of knick-knacks, so much so that we can hardly move"
1319,II.  ON LUXURY.,"about for fear of upsetting something.  ""I have a fire [in my bedroom]"
1320,II.  ON LUXURY.,"all day,"" writes Carlyle.  ""The bed seems to be about eight feet wide.  Of"
1321,II.  ON LUXURY.,"my paces the room measures fifteen from end to end, forty-five feet long,"
1322,II.  ON LUXURY.,"height and width proportionate, with ancient, dead-looking portraits of"
1323,II.  ON LUXURY.,"queens, kings, Straffords and principalities, etc., really the"
1324,II.  ON LUXURY.,uncomfortablest acme of luxurious comfort that any Diogenes was set into
1325,II.  ON LUXURY.,"in these late years.""  Thoreau's furniture at Walden consisted of a bed,"
1326,II.  ON LUXURY.,"a table, a desk, three chairs, a looking-glass three inches in diameter,"
1327,II.  ON LUXURY.,"a pair of tongs, a kettle, a frying-pan, a wash-bowl, two knives and"
1328,II.  ON LUXURY.,"forks, three plates, one cup, one spoon, a jug for oil, a jug for"
1329,II.  ON LUXURY.,"molasses, and a japanned lamp.  There were no ornaments.  He writes, ""I"
1330,II.  ON LUXURY.,"had three pieces of limestone on my desk, but I was terrified to find"
1331,II.  ON LUXURY.,"that they required to be dusted daily, and I threw them out of the window"
1332,II.  ON LUXURY.,"in disgust."""
1333,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1334,II.  ON LUXURY.,"""Our cottage is quite large enough for us, though very small,"" wrote Miss"
1335,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Wordsworth, ""and we have made it neat and comfortable within doors; and"
1336,II.  ON LUXURY.,"it looks very nice on the outside, for though the roses and honeysuckle"
1337,II.  ON LUXURY.,"which we have planted against it are only of this year's growth, yet it"
1338,II.  ON LUXURY.,"is covered all over with green leaves and scarlet flowers, for we have"
1339,II.  ON LUXURY.,"trained scarlet beans upon threads, which are not only exceedingly"
1340,II.  ON LUXURY.,"beautiful, but very useful, as their produce is immense.  We have made a"
1341,II.  ON LUXURY.,"lodging room of the parlour below stairs, which has a stone floor,"
1342,II.  ON LUXURY.,therefore we have covered it all over with matting.  We sit in a room
1343,II.  ON LUXURY.,"above stairs, and we have one lodging room with two single beds, a sort"
1344,II.  ON LUXURY.,"of lumber room, and a small, low, unceiled room, which I have papered"
1345,II.  ON LUXURY.,"with newspapers, and in which we have put a small bed.  Our servant is an"
1346,II.  ON LUXURY.,"old woman of 60 years of age, whom we took partly out of charity.""  Here"
1347,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Miss Wordsworth and her brother, the great poet, lived on the simplest"
1348,II.  ON LUXURY.,"fare and drank cold water, and hence issued those noble poems which more"
1349,II.  ON LUXURY.,than any others teach us the higher life.
1350,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1351,II.  ON LUXURY.,"""Blush, grandeur, blush; proud courts, withdraw your blaze;"

1354,II.  ON LUXURY.,"""I turned schoolmaster,"" says Sydney Smith, ""to educate my son, as I"
1355,II.  ON LUXURY.,could not afford to send him to school.  Mrs. Sydney turned
1356,II.  ON LUXURY.,schoolmistress to educate my girls as I could not afford a governess.  I
1357,II.  ON LUXURY.,turned farmer as I could not let my land.  A man servant was too
1358,II.  ON LUXURY.,"expensive, so I caught up a little garden girl, made like a milestone,"
1359,II.  ON LUXURY.,"christened her Bunch, put a napkin in her hand, and made her my butler."
1360,II.  ON LUXURY.,"The girls taught her to read, Mrs. Sydney to wait, and I undertook her"
1361,II.  ON LUXURY.,morals.  Bunch became the best butler in the country.  I had little
1362,II.  ON LUXURY.,"furniture, so I bought a cartload of deals; took a carpenter (who came to"
1363,II.  ON LUXURY.,"me for parish relief) called Jack Robinson, with a face like a full moon,"
1364,II.  ON LUXURY.,"into my service, established him in a barn, and said, 'Jack, furnish my"
1365,II.  ON LUXURY.,"house.'  You see the result."""
1366,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1367,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Then what shall I say of the luxury of endless daily papers, leading"
1368,II.  ON LUXURY.,"articles, short paragraphs, reviews, illustrated papers,--are not these"
1369,II.  ON LUXURY.,"luxuries?  Are they not inventions for making thought easy, or rather for"
1370,II.  ON LUXURY.,the purpose of relieving us from the trouble of thinking for ourselves.
1371,II.  ON LUXURY.,"May I also, without raising a religious controversy, observe that in"
1372,II.  ON LUXURY.,religious worship we are prone to relieve ourselves from the trouble of
1373,II.  ON LUXURY.,deep and consecutive thought by surrounding our minds with a sort of mist
1374,II.  ON LUXURY.,"of feeling and sentiment; by providing beautiful music, pictures, and"
1375,II.  ON LUXURY.,"ornaments, and so resting satisfied in a somewhat indolent feeling of"
1376,II.  ON LUXURY.,"goodness, and not troubling ourselves with too much effort of reason.  A"
1377,II.  ON LUXURY.,"love of the beautiful undoubtedly tends to elevate and refine the mind,"
1378,II.  ON LUXURY.,but the follies of the false love and the dangers of an inordinate love
1379,II.  ON LUXURY.,are numerous and deadly.  It is absurd that a man should either be or
1380,II.  ON LUXURY.,pretend to be absolutely absorbed in the worship of a dado or a China tea
1381,II.  ON LUXURY.,"cup so as to care for nothing else, and to be unable to do anything else"
1382,II.  ON LUXURY.,but stare at it with his head on one side.  With most people the whole
1383,II.  ON LUXURY.,"thing is the mere affectation of affected people, who, if they were not"
1384,II.  ON LUXURY.,"affected in one way, would be so in another.  Boswell was a very affected"
1385,II.  ON LUXURY.,"man.  He says, ""I remember it distressed me to think of going into"
1386,II.  ON LUXURY.,another world where Shakespeare's poetry did not exist; but a lady
1387,II.  ON LUXURY.,"relieved me by saying, 'The first thing you will meet in the other world"
1388,II.  ON LUXURY.,"will be an elegant copy of Shakespeare's works presented to you.'"""
1389,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Boswell says he felt much comforted, but I suspect the lady was laughing"
1390,II.  ON LUXURY.,"at him.  I like the ""elegant copy"" very much.  It is certain that in this"
1391,II.  ON LUXURY.,"world there is a deal of rough work to be done, and I feel that,"
1392,II.  ON LUXURY.,"attractive and beautiful as so many things are, too much absorption of"
1393,II.  ON LUXURY.,them has a weakening and enervating effect.
1394,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1395,II.  ON LUXURY.,"I have spoken of the luxuries of the table, of the house, of travel, and"
1396,II.  ON LUXURY.,"of a love of ease and beautiful surroundings.  There are, however, some"
1397,II.  ON LUXURY.,people who are very luxurious without caring much for any of these
1398,II.  ON LUXURY.,"things.  Their main desire appears to be to live a long time, and to"
1399,II.  ON LUXURY.,preserve their youth and beauty to the last.  For this purpose they
1400,II.  ON LUXURY.,"surround themselves with comfort, they decline to see or hear of anything"
1401,II.  ON LUXURY.,which they don't like for fear it should make their hair grey and their
1402,II.  ON LUXURY.,"faces wrinkled, and their whole talk is of ailments and German waters."
1403,II.  ON LUXURY.,Swift somewhere or other expresses his contempt for this sort of person.
1404,II.  ON LUXURY.,"""A well preserved man is,"" he says, ""a man with no heart and who has done"
1405,II.  ON LUXURY.,"nothing all his life.""  Old ruins look beautiful by reason of the rain"
1406,II.  ON LUXURY.,"and the wind, the heat of August and the frost of January, and I am sure"
1407,II.  ON LUXURY.,"I have often seen in men--aye, and in women too--far more beauty where"
1408,II.  ON LUXURY.,"the tempests have passed over the face and brow, than where the life has"
1409,II.  ON LUXURY.,been more sheltered and less interesting.
1410,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1411,II.  ON LUXURY.,But I must notice before I conclude this part of my subject one of the
1412,II.  ON LUXURY.,"principal causes of a fatal indulgence in luxury, and that is a"
1413,II.  ON LUXURY.,despairing sense of the futility of attempting to do anything worth
1414,II.  ON LUXURY.,"doing, and of inability to strive against what is going on wrong.  This"
1415,II.  ON LUXURY.,"is the meaning of that rather vulgar phrase, ""Anything for a quiet life"";"
1416,II.  ON LUXURY.,and this is the reason why with many people everything and everybody is
1417,II.  ON LUXURY.,"always a ""bore.""  Here, too, is the secret of that suave, polished, soft-"
1418,II.  ON LUXURY.,"voiced manner so much affected nowadays by highly-educated young men, and"
1419,II.  ON LUXURY.,"that somewhat chilly reserve in which they wrap themselves up.  ""Pray"
1420,II.  ON LUXURY.,"don't ask us to give an opinion, or show an interest, or discuss any"

1432,II.  ON LUXURY.,"possible for us."""
1433,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1434,II.  ON LUXURY.,"These, then, are some of the forms which luxury takes in the present"
1435,II.  ON LUXURY.,"century, and these are some of the outcomes of an advanced, and still"
1436,II.  ON LUXURY.,"rapidly advancing, civilization.  These, too, seem to be the invariable"
1437,II.  ON LUXURY.,accompaniments of such an advance.  A very similar picture of Rome in the
1438,II.  ON LUXURY.,days of Cicero and Caesar is drawn by Mr. Froude in his _Caesar_.  He
1439,II.  ON LUXURY.,"says: ""With such vividness, with such transparent clearness, the age"
1440,II.  ON LUXURY.,"stands before us of Cato and Pompey, of Cicero and Julius Caesar; the"
1441,II.  ON LUXURY.,more distinctly because it was an age in so many ways the counterpart of
1442,II.  ON LUXURY.,"our own, the blossoming period of the old civilization.  It was an age of"
1443,II.  ON LUXURY.,material progress and material civilization; an age of civil liberty and
1444,II.  ON LUXURY.,"intellectual culture; an age of pamphlets and epigrams, of salons and of"
1445,II.  ON LUXURY.,"dinner parties, of sensational majorities and electoral corruption.  The"
1446,II.  ON LUXURY.,"rich were extravagant, for life had ceased to have practical interest,"
1447,II.  ON LUXURY.,except for its material pleasures; the occupation of the higher classes
1448,II.  ON LUXURY.,"was to obtain money without labour, and to spend it in idle enjoyment."
1449,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Patriotism survived on the lips, but patriotism meant the ascendancy of"
1450,II.  ON LUXURY.,"the party which would maintain the existing order of things, or would"
1451,II.  ON LUXURY.,"overthrow it for a more equal distribution of the good things, which"
1452,II.  ON LUXURY.,"alone were valued.  Religion, once the foundation of the laws and rule of"
1453,II.  ON LUXURY.,"personal conduct, had subsided into opinion.  The educated, in their"
1454,II.  ON LUXURY.,"hearts, disbelieved it.  Temples were still built with increasing"
1455,II.  ON LUXURY.,splendour; the established forms were scrupulously observed.  Public men
1456,II.  ON LUXURY.,"spoke conventionally of Providence, that they might throw on their"
1457,II.  ON LUXURY.,opponents the odium of impiety; but of genuine belief that life had any
1458,II.  ON LUXURY.,"serious meaning, there was none remaining beyond the circle of the"
1459,II.  ON LUXURY.,"silent, patient, ignorant multitude.  The whole spiritual atmosphere was"
1460,II.  ON LUXURY.,"saturated with cant--cant moral, cant political, cant religious; an"
1461,II.  ON LUXURY.,affectation of high principle which had ceased to touch the conduct and
1462,II.  ON LUXURY.,flowed on in an increasing volume of insincere and unreal speech.  The
1463,II.  ON LUXURY.,"truest thinkers were those who, like Lucretius, spoke frankly out their"
1464,II.  ON LUXURY.,"real convictions, declared that Providence was a dream, and that man and"
1465,II.  ON LUXURY.,"the world he lived in were material phenomena, generated by natural"
1466,II.  ON LUXURY.,"forces out of cosmic atoms, and into atoms to be again resolved."""
1467,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1468,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Next I am going, as I promised, to consider those indulgences which"
1469,II.  ON LUXURY.,"become luxuries by excessive use, and in this I shall be led also to"
1470,II.  ON LUXURY.,consider the effects of luxury.  It has become a very trite saying that
1471,II.  ON LUXURY.,"riches do not bring happiness; and certainly luxury, which riches can"
1472,II.  ON LUXURY.,"command, does not bring content, which is the greatest of all pleasures."
1473,II.  ON LUXURY.,"On the contrary, the moment the body or mind is over-indulged in any way,"
1474,II.  ON LUXURY.,"it immediately demands more of the same indulgence, and even in stronger"
1475,II.  ON LUXURY.,"doses.  Who does not know that too much wine makes one desire more?  Who,"
1476,II.  ON LUXURY.,"after reading a novel, does not feel a longing for another?"
1477,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1478,II.  ON LUXURY.,"The rich and poor dog, as we all know, meet and discourse of these things"

1491,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1492,II.  ON LUXURY.,"""They're maistly wonderful contented."""
1493,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1494,II.  ON LUXURY.,Caesar afterwards describes the weariness and ennui which pursue the
1495,II.  ON LUXURY.,luxurious--

1497,II.  ON LUXURY.,"""But human bodies are sic fools,"

1501,II.  ON LUXURY.,"They loiter, lounging lank and lazy,"
1502,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Though nothing ails them, yet uneasy."
1503,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Their days insipid, dull, and tasteless;"

1514,II.  ON LUXURY.,"An Italian wit has defined man to be ""an animal which troubles himself"
1515,II.  ON LUXURY.,"with things which don't concern him""; and, when one thinks of the"
1516,II.  ON LUXURY.,"indefatigable way in which people pursue pleasure, all the while deriving"
1517,II.  ON LUXURY.,"no pleasure from it, one is filled with amazement.  ""Life would be very"
1518,II.  ON LUXURY.,"tolerable if it were not for its pleasures,"" said Sir Cornewall Lewis,"
1519,II.  ON LUXURY.,and I am satisfied that half the weariness of life comes from the vain
1520,II.  ON LUXURY.,attempts which are made to satisfy a jaded appetite.
1521,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1522,II.  ON LUXURY.,"There are many things which are not luxuries _per se_, but become so if"
1523,II.  ON LUXURY.,"indulged in to excess.  Take, for instance, smoking and drinking.  One"
1524,II.  ON LUXURY.,"pipe a day and one glass of wine a day are not luxuries, but a great many"
1525,II.  ON LUXURY.,a day are luxuries.  So lying in bed five minutes after you wake is not a
1526,II.  ON LUXURY.,"luxury, but so lying for an hour is.  The man who is fond precociously of"
1527,II.  ON LUXURY.,"stirring may be a spoon, but the man who lies in bed half the day is"
1528,II.  ON LUXURY.,something worse.  Then it must be remembered that a single indulgence in
1529,II.  ON LUXURY.,"one luxury produces scarcely any effect on the mind or body, but a habit"
1530,II.  ON LUXURY.,of indulging in that luxury has a great effect.
1531,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1532,II.  ON LUXURY.,"""The sins which practice burns into the blood,"

1535,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1536,II.  ON LUXURY.,I am surely right in noticing that the rich man is said to have fared
1537,II.  ON LUXURY.,"sumptuously _every_ day, as though faring sumptuously might have no"
1538,II.  ON LUXURY.,"significance, but the constantly faring sumptuously was what had degraded"
1539,II.  ON LUXURY.,and debased the man below the level of the beggar at his gate.  I feel
1540,II.  ON LUXURY.,"that to be luxurious occasionally is no bad thing, if we can keep our"
1541,II.  ON LUXURY.,"self-control, and return constantly to simple habits.  There is something"
1542,II.  ON LUXURY.,very natural in the prayer which a little child was overheard to
1543,II.  ON LUXURY.,"make--""God, make me a good little girl, but""--after a pause--""naughty"
1544,II.  ON LUXURY.,"sometimes.""  It is the habit of being naughty which is pernicious.  Can"
1545,II.  ON LUXURY.,"anyone doubt that the man who, on the whole, leads a hardy and not over-"
1546,II.  ON LUXURY.,indulgent life will be more capable of performing any duty which may
1547,II.  ON LUXURY.,"devolve upon him than a man who ""had but fed on the roses and lain in the"
1548,II.  ON LUXURY.,"lilies of life."""
1549,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1550,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Sydney Smith, in his sketches of Moral Philosophy, notices that habits of"
1551,II.  ON LUXURY.,indulgence grow on us so much that we go through the act of indulgence
1552,II.  ON LUXURY.,"without noticing it or feeling the pleasure of it; yet, if some accident"
1553,II.  ON LUXURY.,"occurs to rob us of our accustomed pleasure, we feel the want of it most"
1554,II.  ON LUXURY.,"keenly.  Speaking of Hobbes, the philosopher, he says that he had twelve"
1555,II.  ON LUXURY.,pipes of tobacco laid by him every night before he began to write.
1556,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Without this luxury ""he could have done nothing; all his speculations"
1557,II.  ON LUXURY.,"would have been at an end, and without his twelve pipes he might have"
1558,II.  ON LUXURY.,"been a friend to devotion or to freedom, which in the customary tenour of"
1559,II.  ON LUXURY.,"his thoughts he certainly was not."""
1560,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1561,II.  ON LUXURY.,In Fielding's _Life of Jonathan Wild_ Mr. Wild plays at cards with the
1562,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Count.  ""Such was the power of habit over the minds of these illustrious"
1563,II.  ON LUXURY.,persons that Mr. Wild could not keep his hands out of the Count's pockets
1564,II.  ON LUXURY.,"though he knew they were empty, nor could the Count abstain from palming"
1565,II.  ON LUXURY.,"a card though he was well aware Mr. Wild had no money to pay him."""
1566,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1567,II.  ON LUXURY.,If we are curious to know who is the most degraded and most wretched of
1568,II.  ON LUXURY.,"human beings, look for the man who has practised a vice so long that he"
1569,II.  ON LUXURY.,"curses it and clings to it.  Say everything for vice which you can say,"
1570,II.  ON LUXURY.,magnify any pleasure as much as you please; but don't believe you can
1571,II.  ON LUXURY.,"keep it, don't believe you have any secret for sending on quicker the"
1572,II.  ON LUXURY.,sluggish blood and for refreshing the faded nerve.
1573,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1574,II.  ON LUXURY.,"There is no doubt that habits of luxury produce discontent, the more we"
1575,II.  ON LUXURY.,have the more we want.  The sin of covetousness is not (curiously enough)
1576,II.  ON LUXURY.,"the sin of the poor, but of the rich.  It is the rich man who covets"
1577,II.  ON LUXURY.,Naboth's vineyard.  I knew an old lady who had a beautiful house facing
1578,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Hyde Park, and lived by herself with a companion, and certainly had room"
1579,II.  ON LUXURY.,"enough and to spare.  Her house was one of a row, and the next house"
1580,II.  ON LUXURY.,"being an end house projected, so that all the front rooms were about a"
1581,II.  ON LUXURY.,"foot longer than those of the old lady.  ""Ah,"" she used to sigh, ""he's a"
1582,II.  ON LUXURY.,"dear good man, the old colonel, but I should like to have his"
1583,II.  ON LUXURY.,"house--please God to take him!""  This showed a submission to the will of"
1584,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Providence, and a desire for the everlasting welfare of her neighbour"
1585,II.  ON LUXURY.,"which was truly edifying; but covetousness was at the root of it, and a"
1586,II.  ON LUXURY.,longing to indulge herself.
1587,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1588,II.  ON LUXURY.,The effect of habits of luxury upon the brute creation is easily seen.
1589,II.  ON LUXURY.,How dreadfully the harmless necessary cat deteriorates when it is over-
1590,II.  ON LUXURY.,"fed and over-warmed.  It may, for all I know, become more humane, but it"
1591,II.  ON LUXURY.,becomes absolutely unfit to get its own living.  What is more despicable
1592,II.  ON LUXURY.,"than a lady's lap-dog, grown fat and good for nothing, and only able to"
1593,II.  ON LUXURY.,"eat macaroons!  Even worms, according to Darwin, when constantly fed on"
1594,II.  ON LUXURY.,"delicacies, become indolent and lose all their cunning."
1595,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1596,II.  ON LUXURY.,I will note next that habits of self-indulgence render us careless of the
1597,II.  ON LUXURY.,misfortunes of others.  Nero was fiddling when Rome was burning.  And
1598,II.  ON LUXURY.,upon the other hand privations make us regardful of others.  In Bulwer's
1599,II.  ON LUXURY.,"_Parisians_ two luxurious bachelors in the siege of Paris, one of whom"
1600,II.  ON LUXURY.,"has just missed his favourite dog, sit down to a meagre repast, on what"
1601,II.  ON LUXURY.,"might be fowl or rabbit; and the master of the lost dog, after finishing"
1602,II.  ON LUXURY.,"his meal, says with a sigh, ""Ah, poor Dido, how she would have enjoyed"
1603,II.  ON LUXURY.,"those bones!""  Probably she would have done so, in case they had not been"
1604,II.  ON LUXURY.,"her own.  Of course we all know Goldsmith's _Deserted Village_, and that"
1605,II.  ON LUXURY.,"it is all about luxury.  It is, however, very poetical poetry (if I may"
1606,II.  ON LUXURY.,"say so), and I don't know that it gives much assistance to a sober,"
1607,II.  ON LUXURY.,"prosaic view of the subject like the present.  ""O Luxury, thou curst by"
1608,II.  ON LUXURY.,"heaven's decree,"" sounds very grand; but I have not the least idea what"
1609,II.  ON LUXURY.,"it means.  The pictures drawn in the poem of simple rural pleasures, and"
1610,II.  ON LUXURY.,"of gaudy city delights, are very pleasing; and the moral drawn from it"
1611,II.  ON LUXURY.,"all, viz., that nations sunk in luxury are hastening to decay, may be"
1612,II.  ON LUXURY.,"true enough; but what strikes one most is that, if Goldsmith thought that"
1613,II.  ON LUXURY.,"England was hastening to decay when he wrote, what would he think if he"
1614,II.  ON LUXURY.,were alive now.
1615,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1616,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Well then, if the pleasures of luxury bring nothing but pain and trouble"
1617,II.  ON LUXURY.,"in the pursuit of them, to what end do they lead?"

1636,II.  ON LUXURY.,"If these be the effects of luxuries, why is it that we continue to strive"
1637,II.  ON LUXURY.,to increase them with all our might?  I have already insisted that I am
1638,II.  ON LUXURY.,"not speaking of such things as are beneficial to body and soul, but such"
1639,II.  ON LUXURY.,"as are detrimental.  But it will be said, you are spending money, and to"
1640,II.  ON LUXURY.,"gratify your longings labourers of different sorts have been employed,"
1641,II.  ON LUXURY.,and the wealth of the world is thereby increased.  But we must consider
1642,II.  ON LUXURY.,"the loss to the man who is indulging himself, and therefore the loss to"
1643,II.  ON LUXURY.,"the community; and further, that his money might have gone in producing"
1644,II.  ON LUXURY.,"something necessary, and not noxious, something in its turn reproductive."
1645,II.  ON LUXURY.,"In Boswell's _Life of Johnson_ is this passage, ""Johnson as usual"
1646,II.  ON LUXURY.,defended luxury.  You cannot spend money in luxury without doing good to
1647,II.  ON LUXURY.,"the poor.  Nay, you do more good to them by spending it in luxury; you"
1648,II.  ON LUXURY.,"make them exert industry, whereas by giving it you keep them idle.  I own"
1649,II.  ON LUXURY.,"indeed there may be more virtue in giving it immediately in charity, than"
1650,II.  ON LUXURY.,"in spending it in luxury.""  He was then asked if this was not"
1651,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Mandeville's doctrine of ""private vices are public benefits.""  Of course"
1652,II.  ON LUXURY.,"this did not suit him, and he demolished it.  He said, ""Mandeville puts"
1653,II.  ON LUXURY.,"the case of a man who gets drunk at an alehouse, and says it is a public"
1654,II.  ON LUXURY.,"benefit, because so much money is got by it to the public.  But it must"
1655,II.  ON LUXURY.,be considered that all the good gained by this through the gradation of
1656,II.  ON LUXURY.,"alehouse-keeper, brewer, maltster, and farmer, is overbalanced by the"
1657,II.  ON LUXURY.,"evil caused to the man and his family by his getting drunk."""
1658,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1659,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Perhaps you will say, what is a man to do with his money, if he may not"
1660,II.  ON LUXURY.,"spend it in luxury?  If, as Dr. Johnson says, and as we all of us find"
1661,II.  ON LUXURY.,"out occasionally, it is worse spent if given in charity, are we to hoard"
1662,II.  ON LUXURY.,"it?  No, surely this is more contemptible still.  ""What is the use of all"
1663,II.  ON LUXURY.,"your money,"" said one distinguished barrister to another, ""you can't live"
1664,II.  ON LUXURY.,"many more years, and you can't take it with you when you go?  Besides, if"
1665,II.  ON LUXURY.,"you could, it would all melt where you're going.""  This hoarding of"
1666,II.  ON LUXURY.,"wealth, this craving for it, is only another form of luxury, the luxury"
1667,II.  ON LUXURY.,"of growing rich.  Some like to be thought rich, and called rich, and"
1668,II.  ON LUXURY.,treated with a fawning respect on account of their riches; others love to
1669,II.  ON LUXURY.,"hide their riches, but to hug their money in secret, and seem to enjoy"
1670,II.  ON LUXURY.,the prospect of dying rich.  I was engaged in a singular case some time
1671,II.  ON LUXURY.,"ago, in which an old lady who had starved herself to death, and lived in"
1672,II.  ON LUXURY.,"the greatest squalor, had secreted 250 pounds in a stocking under the"
1673,II.  ON LUXURY.,"mattress of her bed.  It was stolen by one nephew, who was sued for it by"
1674,II.  ON LUXURY.,"another, and all the money went in law expenses.  If then we are not to"
1675,II.  ON LUXURY.,"spend our money upon luxuries, and if we are not to hoard it, what are we"
1676,II.  ON LUXURY.,to do with it if we have more than we can lay out in what is useful.  I
1677,II.  ON LUXURY.,have not time (nor is the question a part of my subject) to discuss what
1678,II.  ON LUXURY.,"should be done with the money hitherto spent in idle luxury.  We know,"
1679,II.  ON LUXURY.,"however, that we have the poor always with us, and that we can always"
1680,II.  ON LUXURY.,learn the luxury of doing good.  In one way or another we ought to see
1681,II.  ON LUXURY.,that our superfluous wealth should drain from the high lands into the
1682,II.  ON LUXURY.,"valleys; not indeed to make the poor luxurious, but to provide them with"
1683,II.  ON LUXURY.,"comfort, to give them health, strength, and enjoyment.  I think then that"
1684,II.  ON LUXURY.,"if we are wise men, seeing that we are placed in a world of care,"
1685,II.  ON LUXURY.,"trouble, and hard work, from which no man can escape; and seeing that,"
1686,II.  ON LUXURY.,"upon the other hand, we are living in a country and in an age when we are"
1687,II.  ON LUXURY.,"surrounded with all that makes life pleasant and enjoyable, we shall"
1688,II.  ON LUXURY.,endeavour to find out some mode of harmonizing these different chords.  It
1689,II.  ON LUXURY.,need hardly be said how far removed luxury is from the spirit of
1690,II.  ON LUXURY.,"Christianity, and from the life of its Founder; yet it may reverently be"
1691,II.  ON LUXURY.,remembered that on more than one occasion He showed His tender regard for
1692,II.  ON LUXURY.,the weakness of human nature by stamping with His approval the pleasures
1693,II.  ON LUXURY.,of convivial festivity.
1694,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1695,II.  ON LUXURY.,"What then is the remedy against luxury?  I would say shortly,--in work.  A"
1696,II.  ON LUXURY.,"busy man has no time for luxury, and there is no reason why every man"
1697,II.  ON LUXURY.,"should not have enough to do, if he will only do it.  And I am sure the"
1698,II.  ON LUXURY.,"same rule applies to the ladies, although a very busy man once wrote of"
1699,II.  ON LUXURY.,his wife--
1700,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1701,II.  ON LUXURY.,"""In work, work, work, in work alway"
1702,II.  ON LUXURY.,My every day is past;
1703,II.  ON LUXURY.,I very slowly make the coin--
1704,II.  ON LUXURY.,"She spends it very fast."""
1705,II.  ON LUXURY.,
1706,II.  ON LUXURY.,"But speaking seriously, I am sure that in some sort of work lies the"
1707,II.  ON LUXURY.,antidote to luxury.  When Orpheus sailed past the beautiful islands
1708,II.  ON LUXURY.,"""lying in dark purple spheres of sea,"" and heard the songs of the idle"
1709,II.  ON LUXURY.,"and luxurious syrens floating languidly over the waters, he drowned their"
1710,II.  ON LUXURY.,singing in a paean to the gods.  Religion often affords a great incentive
1711,II.  ON LUXURY.,"to work for the good of others; and, in working for others, we have"
1712,II.  ON LUXURY.,"neither the time, nor the inclination, to be over indulgent of ourselves."
1713,II.  ON LUXURY.,"So, the desire to obtain fame and renown has often produced men of the"
1714,II.  ON LUXURY.,"austere and non-indulgent type, as the Duke of Wellington and many"
1715,II.  ON LUXURY.,others:--

1737,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.
1738,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,
1739,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,
1740,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"Charles Porkington, M.A., sometime fellow of St. Swithin, was born of"
1741,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"humble parents.  He was educated, with a due regard for economy, in the"
1742,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"mathematics by his father, and in the prevailing theology of the district"
1743,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,by his mother.  The village schoolmaster had also assisted in the
1744,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,completion of his education by teaching him a little bad Latin.  He was
1745,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"ultimately sent to college, his parents inferring that he would make a"
1746,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"success of the study of books, because he had always shown a singular"
1747,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,inaptitude for anything else.  At college he had read hard.  The common
1748,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,sights and sounds of University life had been unheeded by him.  They
1749,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"passed before his eyes, and they entered into his ears, but his mind"
1750,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"refused to receive any impression from them.  After taking a high degree,"
1751,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"and being elected a fellow, he had written a novel of a strongly"
1752,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"melodramatic cast, describing college life, and showing such an intimate"
1753,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"acquaintance with the obscurer parts of it, that a great many ladies"
1754,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"declared that ""they always thought so;--it was just as they supposed."""
1755,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"The novel, however, did not meet with much success, and he then turned to"
1756,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"the more lucrative but far less noble occupation of ""coaching.""  He could"
1757,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,not be said to be absolutely unintellectual.  As he had not profited by
1758,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"the experience of life, so he had not been contaminated by it.  He was"
1759,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"moral, chiefly in a negative sense, and was not inclined to irreligion."
1760,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"The faith of his parents sat, perhaps, uncomfortably upon him; and he had"
1761,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,not sufficient strength of mind to adopt a new pattern.  He was in short
1762,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"an amiable mathematician, and a feeble classic; and I think that is all"
1763,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,that could be said of him with any certainty.  There seemed to be an
1764,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"absence of character which might be called characteristic, and a"
1765,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,feebleness of will so absolute as to disarm contempt.
1766,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,
1767,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,A portion of Porkington's hard earned gains was transmitted regularly to
1768,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"his two aged parents, while he himself, partly from habit and partly from"
1769,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"indifference, lived as frugally as possible."
1770,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,
1771,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"""Bless me!"" cried Mrs. Porkington, within six months of her marriage, ""To"
1772,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,think that you should have squandered such large sums of money upon
1773,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"people who seem to have got on very well without them."""
1774,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,
1775,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"""My dear,"" replied he, ""they are very poor, and in want of many"
1776,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"comforts."""
1777,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,
1778,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"""Of course I am sorry they cannot have them now,"" retorted she, ""and it"
1779,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"is therefore a pity they ever should have had them."""
1780,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,
1781,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"Porkington sighed slightly, but had already learned not to contend, if he"
1782,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,could remember not to do so.  Mrs. Porkington was of large stature and
1783,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,majestic carriage; and had moreover a voice sufficiently powerful to keep
1784,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"order in an Irish brigade, or to command a vessel in a storm without the"
1785,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"assistance of a trumpet.  Mr. Porkington, on the other hand, was a"
1786,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"little, dry, pale, plain man, with an abstracted and nervous manner, and"
1787,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,a voice that had never grown up so as to match even the little body from
1788,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"which it came, but was a sort of cracked treble whisper.  Moreover, when"
1789,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"Mrs. Porkington wished to speak her mind to her husband, she would"
1790,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"recline upon a sofa in an impressive manner, and fix her eyes upon the"
1791,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"ceiling.  Mr. Porkington, on these occasions, would sit on the very edge"
1792,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"of the most uncomfortable chair, his toes turned out, his hands embracing"
1793,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"his knees, and his eyes tracing the patterns upon the carpet, as though"
1794,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,with a view of studying some abstruse theory of curves.  On which side
1795,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,the victory lay under these circumstances it is easy to guess.
1796,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,
1797,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,Mrs. Porkington felt the advantage of her position and followed it up.
1798,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,
1799,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"""I never, my dear, mention any subject to you, but you immediately fling"
1800,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"your parents at me."""
1801,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,
1802,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,Mr. Porkington would as soon have thought of throwing St. Paul's
1803,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,Cathedral.
1804,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,
1805,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,After a honeymoon spent in the Lake district the happy pair went to pay a
1806,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"visit to the parents of the bridegroom, and Porkington had so brightened"
1807,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"and revived during his stay there, and had expressed himself so happy in"
1808,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"their society, that Mrs. Porkington could not forgive him.  In the"
1809,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"company of his wife's father, on the contrary, he relapsed into a state"
1810,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"bordering upon coma; and no wonder, for that worthy retired tallow"
1811,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"merchant was a perfect specimen of ponderous pomposity, and had"
1812,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,absolutely nothing in common with the shy scholar who had become his son-
1813,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,in-law.  Mr. Candlish had lost the great part of the money he had made by
1814,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"tallow, and by consequence had nothing to give his daughter; but she"
1815,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,behaved herself as a woman should whose father might at one time have
1816,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"given her ten thousand pounds.  ""My papa, my dear, was worth at least"
1817,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"40,000 pounds when he retired,"" was the form in which Mrs. Porkington"
1818,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"flung her surviving parent at the head of her husband, and crushed him"
1819,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,flat with the missile.  To the world at large she spoke of her father as
1820,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"""being at present a gentleman of moderate means.""  Now, as a gentleman of"
1821,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,moderate means cannot be expected to provide for a sister of no means at
1822,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"all; and as Mrs. Porkington, not having been blessed with children by her"
1823,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"marriage, required a companion, her aunt tacked herself on to Mr."
1824,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"Porkington's establishment, and became a permanent and substantial"
1825,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"fixture.  Fat, ugly, and spiteful when she dared, she became a thorn in"
1826,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"the side of the poor tutor, and supported on all occasions the whims and"
1827,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"squabbles of her niece.  Whenever the ""coach"" evinced any tendency to"
1828,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"travel too fast, Mrs. Porkington put the ""drag"" on, and the vehicle"
1829,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,stopped.
1830,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,
1831,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"Mr. and Mrs. Porkington had now been married three years; and, as the"
1832,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"long vacation was at hand, it became necessary to arrange their plans for"
1833,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"a ""Reading Party."""
1834,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,
1835,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"""If I might be allowed to suggest,"" said Mrs. Porkington, reclining on"
1836,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"her sofa, with her eyes fixed upon the ceiling, ""I think a continental"
1837,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,reading party would be the most beneficial to the young men.  The air of
1838,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"the continent, I have always found (Mrs. Porkington had crossed the"
1839,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"channel upon one occasion) is very invigorating; and, though I know you"
1840,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"don't speak French, my dear, yet you should avail yourself of every"
1841,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"opportunity of acquiring it."""
1842,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,
1843,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"""But, my love,"" he replied, ""we must consider.  Many parents have an"
1844,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"objection to the expense, and--"""
1845,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,
1846,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"""Oh, of course!"" she interrupted, ""if ever I venture, which I seldom do,"
1847,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"to propose anything, there are fifty objections raised at once.  Pray,"
1848,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,may I ask to what uncomfortable quarter of the globe you propose to take
1849,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"me?  Perhaps to the Gold Coast--or some other deadly spot--quite likely!"""
1850,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,
1851,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"""Well, my love,"" said the Coach, ""I thought of the Lakes."""
1852,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,
1853,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"""Thought of the Lakes!"" slowly repeated his wife.  ""Since I have had the"
1854,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"honour of being allied with you in marriage, I believe you have never"
1855,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"thought of anything else!"""
1856,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,
1857,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"There was some truth in this, and the tutor felt it.  ""Then, my dear,"""
1858,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"said he mildly, ""I really do not know where we should go."""
1859,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,
1860,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"Thereupon his wife ran through the names of several likely places, to"
1861,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,each of which she stated some clear and decided objection.  Ultimately
1862,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,she mentioned Babbicombe as being a place she might be induced to regard
1863,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,with favour; the truth being that she had made up her mind from the first
1864,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"not to be taken anywhere else.  ""Babbicombe by all means let it be,"" said"
1865,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"he, ""since you wish it."""
1866,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,
1867,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"""I do not wish it at all,"" she cried, ""as you know quite well, my dear;"
1868,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,and it is very hard that you should always try to make it appear that I
1869,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"wish to do a thing, when I have no desire at all upon the subject.  Have"
1870,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"you noticed, aunt, how invariably Charles endeavours to take an unfair"
1871,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"advantage of anything I say, and tries to make out I wish a thing which"
1872,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"he has himself proposed?"""
1873,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,
1874,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"The Drag said she had noticed it very often, and wondered at it very"
1875,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"much.  She thought it was very unfair indeed, and showed a domineering"
1876,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"spirit very far from Christian in her opinion, though, of course,"
1877,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,opinions might differ.
1878,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,
1879,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"Porkington took a turn in his little back garden, and smoked a pipe,"
1880,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"which seemed to console him somewhat; and, after a few more skirmishes,"
1881,CHAPTER I.--THE COACH.,"the coach, harness, drag, team and all arrived at Babbicombe."

1888,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,Let the man who disapproves of reading parties suggest something better.
1889,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"""Let the lads stop at home,"" says one.  Have you ever tried it?  They"
1890,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"soon become a bore to themselves and all around them.  ""Let them go by"

1893,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"The Dons won't let them stop up, unless they are likely to take high"
1894,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"degrees; and, even if the Dons would permit it, it would be too"
1895,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"oppressively dull for the young men.  ""At all events, let reading parties"
1896,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"be really _reading_ parties.""  Whoever said they should be anything else?"
1897,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,For my part I know nothing in this life equal to reading parties.  Do
1898,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"Jones and Brown, who are perched upon high stools in the city, ever dream"
1899,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"of starting for the Lakes with a ledger each, to enter their accounts and"
1900,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"add up the items by the margin of Derwentwater.  Do Bagshaw and Tomkins,"
1901,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"emerging from their dismal chambers in Pump Court, take their Smith's"
1902,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"_Leading Cases_, or their _Archbold_, to Shanklyn or Cowes?  Do Sawyer"
1903,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"and Allen study medicine in a villa on the Lake of Geneva?  I take it, it"
1904,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,is an invincible sign of the universality of the classics and mathematics
1905,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,that they will adapt themselves with equal ease to the dreariest of
1906,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,college rooms or to the most romantic scenery.
1907,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,
1908,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"Harry Barton, Richard Glenville, Thomas Thornton, and I, made up"
1909,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,Porkington's Reading Party.
1910,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,
1911,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,Harry Barton's father was a Manchester cotton spinner of great wealth.
1912,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"Himself a man of no education, beyond such knowledge as he had picked up"
1913,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"in the course of an arduous life, the cotton spinner was not oblivious to"
1914,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,those advantages which ought to accrue to a liberal education; and he
1915,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"resolved that his son, a fine handsome lad, should not fail in life for"
1916,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"want of them.  Young Barton had, therefore, in due course been sent to"
1917,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"Eton and Camford with a full purse, a vigorous constitution, a light"
1918,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"heart, and a fair amount of cramming.  At Camford he found himself in the"
1919,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"midst of his old Eton chums, and plunged eagerly into all the animated"
1920,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"life and excitement of the University.  Boating, cricket, rackets,"
1921,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"billiards, wine parties, betting--these formed the chief occupation of"
1922,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"the two years which he had already passed at college.  Reading, upon some"
1923,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"days, formed an agreeable diversion from the monotony of the above-named"
1924,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"more interesting studies.  Porkington, however, who seldom placed a man"
1925,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"wrong, still promised him a second class.  Hearty, generous, a lover of"
1926,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"ease and pleasure, good-natured and easily led, he was a general"
1927,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,favourite; and in some respects deserved to be so.
1928,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,
1929,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"Richard Glenville was the son of an orthodox low church parson, a fat"
1930,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"vicar and canon, a man who, if he was not conformed to the world at"
1931,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"large, was a mere reflection of the little world to which he belonged."
1932,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"His son Richard was a quick-sighted youth, clear and vigorous in"
1933,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"intellect, not deep but acute.  He was high church, because he had lived"
1934,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"among the low church party.  He was a Tory, because his surroundings were"
1935,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"mostly Liberal.  He was inclined to be profane, because his father's"
1936,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"friends bored him by their solemnity.  He was flippant, because they were"
1937,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"dull; careless, because they were cautious; and fast, because they were"
1938,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,slow.  He had an eye for the weak points of things.  He delighted in what
1939,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"is called ""chaff.""  He affected to regard all things with indifference,"
1940,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,and was tolerant of everything except what he was pleased to denounce as
1941,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,shams.  Upon this point he would occasionally become very warm.  If his
1942,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"sense of truth and honour were touched, he became goaded into passion;"
1943,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"but most things appealed to him from their humorous side.  He was tall,"
1944,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"fair, and handsome, the features clean cut and the eyes grey.  His"
1945,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"manners were polished, and he was always well dressed.  He was full of"
1946,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"high spirits and good temper, and was a most agreeable companion to all"
1947,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"to whom his satire did not render him uncomfortable.  Strange to say, he"
1948,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"stood very high in the favour of Mrs. Porkington, who, had she known what"
1949,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"fun he made of her behind her back, would, I think, have sometimes"
1950,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"forgotten that he was the nephew of a peer.  He studied logic, classics,"
1951,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"mathematics, moral philosophy indifferently, because he found that a"
1952,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"certain amount of study conduced to a quiet life with the ""governor.""  He"
1953,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"proposed ultimately, he said, to be called to the Bar, because that was"
1954,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,equivalent to leaving your future career still enveloped in mystery for
1955,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,many years.
1956,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,
1957,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,I do not know that I have very much to say about Thornton.  He was a very
1958,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,estimable young man.  I think he was the only one of the party who might
1959,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"say with a clear conscience that he did some work for his ""coach.""  He"
1960,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"was not short, nor tall, nor good-looking, nor very rich, nor very poor."
1961,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,He was of plebeian origin.  His father was a grocer.  I am sure the young
1962,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"man had been well brought up at home, and had been well taught at school;"
1963,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"and he was a brave, frank, honest fellow enough, but there was withal a"
1964,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,certain common or commonplace way with him.  He acquitted himself well at
1965,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"cricket and football; and I have no doubt he will succeed in life, and be"
1966,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"most respectable, but on the whole very uninteresting."
1967,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,
1968,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"The present writer is one of the most handsome, most amiable, and most"
1969,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,witty of men; but if there is one vice more than another at which his
1970,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"soul revolts, it is the sin of egotism.  Else the world would here have"
1971,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,become the possessor of one of the most eloquent pages in literature.  It
1972,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"is said that artists, who paint their own portraits, make a mere copy of"
1973,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"their image in the looking glass.  For my part, if I had to draw my own"
1974,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"likeness, I would scorn such paltry devices.  The true artist draws from"
1975,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,the imagination.  Let any man think for a moment what manner of man he
1976,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,is.  Is he not at once struck with the fact that he is not as other men
1977,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"are--that he is not extortionate, nor unjust, and so forth?  But, in"
1978,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"truth, if I were to paint my own portrait, I know there are fifty fools"
1979,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,who would think I meant it for themselves; and as I cannot tolerate
1980,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"vanity in other people, I will say no more about it."
1981,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,
1982,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"So at length here at Babbicombe were the coach, harness, drag, and team"
1983,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"duly arrived, and settled for six weeks or more, in a fine large house,"
1984,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"far above the deep blue ocean, and far removed from all the turmoil and"
1985,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,bustle of this busy world.  Wonderful truly are the happiness and
1986,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"privileges of young men, if they only knew how to enjoy them wisely."
1987,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,
1988,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"""I think it is somewhat unthoughtful, to say the least of it,"" said Mrs."
1989,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"Porkington to Glenville, ""that Mr. Porkington should have taken a house"
1990,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"so very far from the beach.  He knows how I adore the sea."""
1991,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,
1992,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"""Perhaps he is jealous of it on that account,"" said Glenville."
1993,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,
1994,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,The Drag said she believed he would be jealous of anything.  For her part
1995,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,if she were tied to such a man she would give him good cause to be
1996,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,jealous.
1997,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,
1998,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,Glenville replied in his most polite manner that he was sure she could
1999,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,never be so cruel.
2000,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,
2001,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,The Drag did not understand him.
2002,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,
2003,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"""Confound the old aunt,"" said he, as he sat down to the table in the"
2004,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"dining-room to his mathematical papers, ""why did she not stick to the"
2005,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"tallow-chandling, instead of coming here?  Don't you think, Barton, our"
2006,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,respected governors ought to pay less for our coaching on account of the
2007,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"drag?  Of course we really pay something extra on her account; but,"
2008,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"generally speaking, you know an irremovable nuisance would diminish the"
2009,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"value of an estate, and I think a coach with an irremovable drag ought to"
2010,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"fetch less than a coach without encumbrances."""
2011,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,
2012,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"""I daresay you are right,"" said Barton.  ""The two women will ruin Porky"
2013,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,between them.  The quantity of donkey chaises they require is something
2014,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"awful.  To be sure the hill is rather steep in hot weather."""
2015,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,
2016,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"""Yes,"" said Glenville, ""they began by trying one chaise between them,"
2017,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,ride and tie; but Mrs. Porkington always would ride the first half of the
2018,CHAPTER II.--THE TEAM.,"way, and so Miss Candlish only rode the last quarter, until at last the"

2082,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,that by standing on a chair in the attic it might be possible to obtain a
2083,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"glimpse of the topmasts of the schooners in the harbour, or the furthest"
2084,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"circle of the distant ocean.  Mr. and Mrs. Delamere, with their two"
2085,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"daughters, occupied lodgings facing the sea.  Next door but one were our"
2086,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"friends, Colonel and Mrs. Bagshaw.  Two Irish captains, O'Brien and"
2087,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"Kelly, were stopping at the Bull Hotel, in the High Street.  On the side"
2088,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,of the hill in our row lived the two beautiful Misses Bankes with their
2089,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"parents and the younger olive branches, much snubbed by those who had"
2090,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"""come out"" into blossom.  The visitors' doctor also lived in our row, and"
2091,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"a young landscape painter (charming, as they all are) had a room"
2092,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"somewhere, but I never could quite make out where it was or how he lived."

2104,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"approached the Delameres' party, who were seated on rugs and shawls"
2105,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"spread upon the huge dry rocks overlooking the deep, clear water which"
2106,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,lapped underneath with a gentle and regular plash and sucking sound.  It
2107,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"was a brilliant day.  Not a cloud was in the sky, and the blue-green seas"
2108,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,lay basking in the sunshine.  A brisk but gentle air had begun to crisp
2109,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"the top of the water, making it sparkle and bubble; and there was just"
2110,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,visible a small silver cord of foam on the coast line of dark crags.  A
2111,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"white sail or a brown, here and there, dotted about the space of ocean,"
2112,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,gleamed in the light of the noon-day sun.  Porpoises rolled and gamboled
2113,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"in the bay, and the round heads of two or three swimmers from the bathing"
2114,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,cove appeared like corks upon the surface of the water.  Half lost in the
2115,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"hazy horizon, a dim fairy island hung between sky and ocean; while"
2116,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"overhead flew the milk-white birds, whose presence inland is said to"

2148,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"""Oh, quite so indeed,"" exclaimed Mrs. Delamere, ""if Mr. Thornton"
2149,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"recommends the book.  My daughter Florence has too much imagination, dear"

2157,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"""Ah!"" said Mrs. Delamere, ""a delightful writer.  The Rev. Charles"
2158,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,Kingsley was a man whom I unfeignedly admire.  Perhaps I might not

2160,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,minds have been matured by a considerable acquaintance with our

2169,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,darling Florence and dearest Beatrix were all that a fond and
2170,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,intellectual mother could desire.  She was anxious to be thought to be
2171,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"trembling on the verge of atheism, to which position her highly-gifted"
2172,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"intelligence quite entitled her; while, at the same time, her strong"
2173,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,judgment and moral virtues enabled her to assist in supporting the
2174,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,orthodox faith.  The younger Miss Delamere (Beatrix) was doing one of
2175,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"those curious pieces of work in which ladies delight, which appear to be"
2176,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"designed for no particular purpose, and which, curiously enough, are"
2177,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,always either a little more or less than half finished.  I think she very
2178,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"seldom spoke.  She was positively crushed by that most superior person,"
2179,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"her mother.  Flo was gazing abstractedly into the sea, hearing her mother"
2180,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"but not listening, while Thornton was seated a foot or two below her,"
2181,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"gazing up into her deep-blue eyes, shaded by her large hat and dark hair,"
2182,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,as happy and deluded as a lunatic who thinks himself monarch of the
2183,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,world.
2184,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,
2185,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,The Squire said he would join us.  I expect his wife rather bored the old
2186,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,gentleman.  We all sauntered up to the little crush of people who were
2187,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,listening (or not listening) to the discordant sounds of the German band.
2188,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"Here we found the whole tribe of Bankes' and the two Irish captains, one"
2189,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,standing in front of each beautiful Miss Bankes; and a little further
2190,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"removed from this party were Colonel and Mrs. and Miss Bagshaw, with the"
2191,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"doctor's son.  Above the cliff, on a slope of grass, lay the young"

2196,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,with the single curl hanging down her back.  Her sister wore two light
2197,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"ones, and it puzzled us very much to account for the difference in"
2198,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"number, and even in colour, for the complexions were the same.  Was"
2199,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,Glenville justified in surmising that the art of the contrivance was to
2200,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,"prove that the curls were natural and indigenous, for if false, he said,"
2201,CHAPTER III.--THE VISITORS.,surely they would be expected to wear two or one each.

2318,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"disorderly manner, and yet with an evident eye to effect.  The aspect was"
2319,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"frank and good-humoured, though somewhat soft and sensuous; and the form,"
2320,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"though full, was not without elegance, and showed both strength and"
2321,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,agility.  No one could pass by her without being arrested by her
2322,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"appearance, but we used to quarrel very much as to her claims to be"
2323,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"called a ""clipper,"" or a ""stunner,"" or whatever was the word in use among"
2324,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,us to express our ideal.
2325,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2326,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"Barton jumped into the boat and away we went, Thornton steering, Mrs."
2327,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"Bagshaw, her daughter, and the Misses Delamere in the stern, Barton"
2328,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"stroke, myself three, Glenville two, and Hawkstone bow--a very fine crew,"
2329,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"let me tell you, for we all knew how to handle an oar,--especially in"
2330,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"smooth water.  And so we passed in front of the parade, waving our pocket"
2331,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"handkerchiefs in answer to those which fluttered on the shore, and rowing"
2332,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"away into the wide sea.  Mrs. Bagshaw, who was an excellent musician, and"
2333,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"her daughter, who had a lovely voice, sang duets and songs for our"
2334,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"amusement; and, with the aid of the two Misses Delamere, made up some"
2335,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"tolerable glees and choruses, in the latter of which we all joined at"
2336,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"intervals, to the confusion of the whole effect,--of the singing in point"
2337,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"of tune, and of the rowing in point of time."
2338,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2339,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"As we were rounding Horn Point, Thornton said to Mrs. Bagshaw, ""Do you"
2340,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"know, there are some such splendid ferns grow in a little ravine you can"
2341,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"see there on the side of that hill.  Do let us land and get some."""
2342,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2343,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""What do you want ferns for?"" asked I, innocently."
2344,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2345,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""Silence in the boat, three,"" cried Glenville.  ""What a hard-hearted"
2346,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"monster you must be!"" he whispered in my ear."
2347,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2348,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""Oh, do let us land,"" said Miss Delamere, ""I do so want some common"
2349,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"bracken""--or whatever it was, for she cared no more than you or I about"
2350,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"the ferns--""I want some for my book, and mamma says we really must"
2351,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"collect some rare specimens before we go home.""  Mrs. Bagshaw guessed"
2352,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"what sort of flower they would be looking for--heartsease, I suppose, or"
2353,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"forget-me-not; but she very good-naturedly agreed to the proposal, and"
2354,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"Hawkstone undertook to show us where we could land.  We were soon ashore,"
2355,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"and Hawkstone said, ""You must not be long, gentlemen, if you please, for"
2356,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"the wind is rising, and it will come on squally before long; and we have"
2357,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"wind and tide against us going back, and a tough job it is often to round"
2358,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"the lighthouse hill."""
2359,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2360,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""All right,"" said Thornton, ""how long can you give us?"""
2361,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2362,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""Twenty minutes at the most,"" said the boatman, ""and you will only just"
2363,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"have time to mount the cliff and come back."""
2364,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2365,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"I heard an indistinct, dull murmur, half of the sea and half of the wind,"
2366,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"and, looking far out to sea, could fancy I saw little white sheep on the"
2367,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,waves.  We left Glenville with Hawkstone talking and smoking.  They were
2368,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"really great friends, although in such different ranks in life.  Glenville"
2369,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,used to rave about him as a true specimen of the old Devon rover.  He was
2370,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"a tall, well-proportioned man, with a clear, open face, very ruddy with"
2371,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"sun and wind and rough exercise, a very pleasant smile, and grey eyes,"
2372,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"rather piercing and deep set.  The brow was fine, and the features"
2373,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"regular, though massive.  The hair and beard were brown and"
2374,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"rough-looking, but his manner was gentle, and had that peculiar courtesy"
2375,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"which makes many a Devon man a gentleman and many a Devon lass a lady,"
2376,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,let them be of ever so humble an origin.
2377,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2378,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"Barton paired off with the younger Miss Delamere, Thornton with the"
2379,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"elder.  Mrs. Bagshaw and I followed, conversing cheerfully of many"
2380,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"things.  I found her a very entertaining and agreeable lady,"
2381,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"accomplished, frank, and amiable.  There was nothing at all peculiar"
2382,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,either in her appearance or conversation.  While I was talking to her I
2383,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,kept wondering whether her outbreaks of temper were the result of some
2384,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"real or supposed cause of jealousy, or were to be attributed solely to a"
2385,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,chronic feeling of irritability against her husband.  In the course of
2386,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,our walk together Mrs. Bagshaw said to me--
2387,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2388,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""Your friend, Mr. Thornton, is evidently very much smitten with Florence"
2389,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"Delamere."""
2390,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2391,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""Yes, I think so,"" I replied, ""but I daresay nothing will come of it.  Her"
2392,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"family would not like it, I suppose; for, you know, they are of a good"
2393,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"family in Norfolk, and Thornton is only the son of a grocer."""
2394,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2395,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""I did not know that,"" she said, ""but I have thought your friend had not"
2396,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,quite the manners of the class to which the Delameres clearly belong.
2397,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"Mrs. Delamere is perhaps not anyone in particular, and she certainly"
2398,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,talks overmuch upon subjects which probably she does not understand.  The
2399,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"young ladies are most agreeable and lady-like, and I think Mr. Thornton"
2400,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,has found that out.  It is easy to see that objections to any engagement
2401,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"would be of the gravest sort--indeed, I imagine, insurmountable.  It is"
2402,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,most unfortunate that this should happen when the young man is away from
2403,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"his parents, who might guide him out of the difficulty.  I think Mrs."
2404,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"Delamere is aware of the attachment, and is not inclined to favour it.  Do"
2405,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,you think you could influence your friend in any way?  You will do him a
2406,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,great service if you can warn him of his danger; if he does not attend to
2407,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"you, you might tell Mr. Porkington, and consult with him."""
2408,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2409,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"I promised to follow her advice as well as I could, for I felt that it"
2410,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"was both kindly meant and reasonable, although I felt myself rather too"
2411,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,young to be entangled in such matters.
2412,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2413,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,* * * * *
2414,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2415,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""Oh what a lovely fern, such a nice little one too.  Do try and dig it up"
2416,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"for me,"" said Florence."
2417,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2418,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""I will try to do my best,"" said Thornton; ""I have got a knife.""  And"
2419,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"down he went upon his knees, and soon extracted a little brittle bladder,"
2420,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"which he handed to the young lady, saying, ""I hope it will live.  Do you"
2421,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"think it will?"""
2422,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2423,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""Oh, yes,"" she said.  ""I can keep it here till we go home, and then plant"
2424,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"it in my rockery, where they flourish nicely, as it is beautifully"
2425,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"sheltered from the sun."""
2426,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2427,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""I wish it were rather a handsomer-looking thing,"" said the young man,"
2428,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,looking rather ruefully at the little specimen.
2429,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2430,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""I shall prize it for the sake of the giver,"" she said, with a slight"
2431,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"blush.  ""But I am afraid you have spoilt your knife."""
2432,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2433,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""Oh, not at all.  Do let me dig up some more."""
2434,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2435,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""No, thank you; do not trouble.  See what a pretty bank of wild thyme."""
2436,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2437,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""Would you like to sit down upon it?  You know it smells all the sweeter"
2438,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"for being crushed."""
2439,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2440,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""Well, it does really look most inviting.""  Florence sat down, saying as"
2441,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"she did so, ""How lovely the wild flowers are--heather and harebells."""
2442,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2443,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""Let me gather some for you.""  He began plucking the flowers, which"
2444,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,flourished in such profusion and variety that a nosegay grew in every
2445,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"foot of turf.  ""When do you think of leaving Babbicombe?"""
2446,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2447,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""In two or three days."""
2448,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2449,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""So soon!"""
2450,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2451,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""Yes; for papa has to go back to attend to his Quarter Sessions."""
2452,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2453,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""I am very, very sorry you are going.  I had hoped you would stay much"
2454,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"longer.  These three weeks have flown like three days."""
2455,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2456,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""Why, Mr. Thornton, I declare you are throwing my flowers away as fast as"
2457,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"you gather them."""
2458,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2459,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""So I am,"" he said.  ""The fact is I hardly know what I am doing.""  The"
2460,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"colour was blazing into his face, and his heart beating wildly."
2461,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""Florence,"" he cried, flinging himself upon his knees beside her,"
2462,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""forgive me if I speak rashly or wildly--I don't know how to speak.  I"
2463,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"don't know what to tell you--but I love you dearly, dearly, with my whole"
2464,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"heart.  I cannot tell--I hope--I think you may like me.  Do not say no, I"
2465,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"implore you.  If you do not like me to speak so wildly, tell me so; but"
2466,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"don't say you will not love me.  Tell me you will love me--if you can."""
2467,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2468,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"Florence was young, and was taken by surprise, or perhaps she might have"
2469,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,stopped the young gentleman at once; but after all it is not unpleasant
2470,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,to a pretty girl to see a good-looking young lad at her feet and to
2471,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"listen to his passionate words of homage.  At length, when he seemed to"
2472,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"come to a pause, she replied: ""Oh, Mr. Thornton, please, please do not"
2473,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"talk so.  This is so sudden.  Our parents know nothing of this!"""
2474,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2475,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""Do you love me--tell me?"""
2476,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2477,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""We are too young.  You really must not--"""
2478,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2479,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""It does not matter about being young."""
2480,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2481,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""Oh, do not speak any more."""
2482,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2483,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""Florence, do you love me?  I shall go mad if you will not answer.""  He"
2484,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"seized her hand as he leant forward, and gazed eagerly into her face,"
2485,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"while he trembled violently with his own emotion.  ""Do you love me--say?"""
2486,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2487,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""I think, I think--I do,"" she said very softly, looking him full in the"
2488,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"face, while he seized her round the waist, and her head leant for one"
2489,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"moment on his shoulder, and he kissed her forehead."
2490,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2491,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"She started up, saying, ""Oh, do let me go, please.  I ought not to have"
2492,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"said so."""
2493,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2494,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"He rose first, and lifted her up by the hand."
2495,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2496,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,* * * * *
2497,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2498,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""I will tell you what it is, Hawkstone,"" said Glenville.  ""I think it is"
2499,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"a d---d shame, and I shall tell him so.  He may be a bigger fellow than"
2500,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"I, but I could punch his head for him, if he were in the wrong and I in"
2501,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"the right."""
2502,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2503,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""I dare say you could, sir, and thank you, sir, for what you say.  I"
2504,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"thought you were a brave, kind gentleman when I first saw you, though you"
2505,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"do like to have a bit of a joke at me at times."""
2506,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2507,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""Bit of a joke!  That's another matter.  But I will never joke again, if"
2508,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,this goes wrong.  But are you quite sure that Nelly is in love with you
2509,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"really, and you with her."""
2510,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2511,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""Why, sir, we have told each other so this hundred times; and I feel as"
2512,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,sure she spoke the truth as God knows I did; and sometimes I think I am a
2513,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"fool to doubt her now.  But you see, sir, she is flattered by the notice"
2514,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"of a grand gentleman.  It may be nothing, but, when I talk to her now,"
2515,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,she seems weary like.  It is not like what it was in the old days before
2516,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"you came, sir.  We were to be married, sir, so soon as the gentle folk"
2517,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"have left the town, that is about six weeks from to-day; but now I hardly"
2518,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"know what to think.  I think one thing one day, and another the next."
2519,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,Sometimes I think I am jealous about nothing.  Sometimes I think he is a
2520,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"gentleman, and will act as such; and sometimes I think, suppose he should"
2521,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,harm her; and then I feel that if he dared to do it I would throttle
2522,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"him.""  Glenville could see the sailor's fists clenching as he spoke, and"
2523,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"he replied, ""Hush, Hawkstone, hush!  This will all come right.  I feel"
2524,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"for you very much, but you must not be violent.  I believe it is all"
2525,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"folly, and Barton will forget all about it in a day or two."""
2526,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2527,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""May be, may be, sir; but will she forget so soon?  When a woman gets a"
2528,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"thing of this sort into her head it sticks there, sir.  There is nothing"
2529,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"to drive it out.  He will go off among his fine friends in London, or"
2530,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"wherever it is; but she will be alone here in the little dull town, and"
2531,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"it is mighty dull in the winter, sir."""
2532,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2533,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""You see, Hawkstone, Barton is a friend of mine; and, though I have only"
2534,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"known him a couple of years, I am sure he is a generous, good sort of"
2535,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"fellow, and honest and truthful, though a bit thoughtless and careless.  I"
2536,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,am sure he will see his own folly and bad conduct when it is shown to
2537,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"him.  This is a sham love of his.  She is a very pretty girl, it is true."
2538,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"You won't mind my saying that?"""
2539,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2540,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""Say away, sir.  I look more to what people mean than what they say."""
2541,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2542,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""Well, no doubt, he has been struck by her beauty; but their positions"
2543,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"are different, and he has only seen her for a week or two.  Besides, he"
2544,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,knows that you and she are fond of one another.  I believe he is only
2545,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,idle and thoughtless.  If I thought for a moment that he was
2546,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"contemplating a blackguardly act, he should be no friend of mine, and I"
2547,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"would not only tell him so, but I would give him a good kicking, or look"
2548,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"on with pleasure while you did it.  But you must be quiet, Hawkstone, at"
2549,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"present, for you know nothing, and a quarrel would only do you harm all"
2550,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"round."""
2551,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2552,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""It's not so easy to be quiet.  The neighbours are beginning to talk,"
2553,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"sir, though they don't let me hear what they say.  I can see by their"
2554,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,looks.  What business has he to sit beside her on the quay?  He is making
2555,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,a fool of her and of me.  I cannot bear it.  Sometimes I feel as if I
2556,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,should go mad.  I don't know what those poor creatures in the Bible felt
2557,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"when they were possessed by the devil, but I believe he comes right into"
2558,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"me when I think of this business.""  Then he bent over the boat and"
2559,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"covered his face with his arms, and his great broad back heaved up and"
2560,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"down, like a boat on the sea.  Glenville left him alone, and puffed away"
2561,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"vigorously at a cigar he was smoking in order to quiet his own feelings,"
2562,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,which had been more excited than he liked.
2563,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2564,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"After a few minutes, Hawkstone raised his head as if from a sleep, and"
2565,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"suddenly exclaimed, ""Hey, sir!  The wind and the sea have not been idle"
2566,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,while we have been talking.  We must be sharp now.  Shout to your
2567,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"friends, sir.  I cannot shout just yet, I think."""
2568,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2569,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,Glenville shouted as loud as he was able.
2570,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2571,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""That won't do, I'm afeard,"" said Hawkstone, and he gave a loud halloo,"
2572,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"which rang from cliff to cliff, and brought out a cloud of gulls, sailing"
2573,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"round and round for a while in great commotion, but soon disappearing"
2574,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,into the cliffs again.
2575,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2576,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,We were most of us already descending when we heard Hawkstone's voice;
2577,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,the boat was soon ready; but where were Thornton and his lady love?  After
2578,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"waiting a while, Hawkstone shouting more than once, it was proposed that"
2579,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,someone should go in search for them.  Hawkstone was getting very
2580,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"impatient, and warned us we should have a hard struggle to get home"
2581,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,again.
2582,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2583,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""It will be a bad job if we cannot get round the point,"" cried he, ""for"
2584,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"then we shall have to land in the bay, and although there will be no"
2585,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"danger if we get off soon, yet the ladies will get a wetting, and maybe"
2586,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"the boat will be damaged.  We shall just get a little water going out,"
2587,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"for the surf is running in strong."""
2588,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2589,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""It is very wonderful,"" said Mrs. Bagshaw, ""how suddenly the wind rises"
2590,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"on this coast, and the waves answer to the lash like wild colts.  The"
2591,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"change from calm to storm is most remarkable."""
2592,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2593,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""Very,"" thought I to myself, when I called to mind the sudden changes of"
2594,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,temper which I had noticed in her.
2595,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2596,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""What can that duffer Thornton be about all this long time?"" asked"
2597,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,Barton.
2598,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2599,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"Mrs. Bagshaw and I exchanged glances.  ""I am not sure,"" said she to me,"
2600,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""that I have not been doing a very imprudent thing in letting them land."""
2601,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2602,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,It was full ten minutes after the arrival of the rest of the party before
2603,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"Thornton and Florence made their appearance, looking very confused and"
2604,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"awkward.  Glenville preceded them, shouting and laughing.  ""Here they"
2605,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"are, caught at last, and apparently quite pleased at keeping us all"
2606,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"waiting, and quite unable to give any account of what they have been"
2607,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,doing.  One little fern has fallen before their united efforts in the
2608,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,space of half an hour or more.  Hawkstone says he'll be shot if he lends
2609,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"you his boat to go a row in another time.  Don't you, Hawkstone?"""
2610,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2611,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""No, sir, I didn't say that.  If a gentleman and a lady like to loiter on"
2612,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"the hill it's nothing to a poor boatman how long they stay, leastways"
2613,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"wind and weather permitting, as the packet says."""
2614,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2615,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"Hawkstone pushed us off through the surf, and it was no easy matter, and,"
2616,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"I daresay, required some judgment and presence of mind to seize the right"
2617,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,moment between the breaking of the great waves.  With all his skill we
2618,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"managed to ship a little water, amid the laughing shrieks of the ladies"
2619,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"and the boisterous shouts of ""two"" and ""three,"" who got some of the water"
2620,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"down their backs.  We were soon under weigh, however, and tugging"
2621,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"manfully on, occasionally missing a stroke when the boat lurched on a"
2622,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"great wave, and making but slow progress.  Fortunately we had not far to"
2623,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"go before we arrived opposite to the parade, where a small crowd of"
2624,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"people was watching our movements with great interest, and the pocket"
2625,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"handkerchiefs again fluttered from the land.  The signals, however, met"
2626,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"with no response from us.  Tug as we would, we seemed to make very little"
2627,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"way, notwithstanding Hawkstone's ""Well rowed, gentlemen, she's moving"
2628,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"fast.  We shall do it yet."""
2629,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2630,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"The waves were now running high, white crested, and with a long, wide"
2631,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,sweep in them.  We were forced to steer close to the rocks at the point
2632,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"in order to keep as much as possible out of the tide, which was running"
2633,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,so strongly a few yards from the land that we never could have made any
2634,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,way against it there.  As it was I could see that for many seconds we did
2635,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"not open a single point of rock, and it was all we could do to keep the"
2636,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,boat from dropping astern.  Just as I was beginning to despair of ever
2637,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"getting back in safety, and was aware that my wind was going, and that"
2638,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"both arms and legs were on the point of giving way, a loud shout from"
2639,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"Hawkstone alarmed us all.  He jumped up, shouting, ""Row hard on the bow"
2640,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"side, ease off on the stroke,"" and in a moment (how he got from the bows"
2641,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,I shall never know!) we saw him seated behind the stern-board with the
2642,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"tiller in his hand.  The boat shot round, shipping a heavy sea, and we"
2643,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"were at one moment within a yard of the rock underneath the parade.  ""Row"
2644,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"hard, all!"" was soon the cry, and away we shot before wind and tide in"
2645,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,the opposite direction to that in which we had been going.  Again we
2646,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"heard Hawkstone's voice, ""Steady, keep steady.  There's nothing to fear."
2647,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"We can run her into the bay!""  Nothing to fear!  But there had been.  One"
2648,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"moment of delay, and we should have been dashed on the rocks.  I do not"
2649,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"know why it was, but the waves now seemed gigantic.  Perhaps excitement"
2650,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"or fear made them seem larger, or perhaps the change in the direction of"
2651,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,the course of the boat had that effect.  Certainly they now seemed to
2652,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"rear their white crests high above us, and to menace us with their huge"
2653,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,forms.  The roar of the breakers upon the beach added to the excitement
2654,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,of the scene.  The ladies sat pale and silent.  I believe all would have
2655,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"gone well, but at the most exigent moment, when we were riding on the"
2656,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"surf which was to land us, ""bow"" and ""three"" missed their strokes and"
2657,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"fell into the bottom of the boat; and, amid great confusion, the boat"
2658,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"swerved round; and, a great wave striking her upon her broadside, she"
2659,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"upset, and rolled the whole party over and over into about three feet of"
2660,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,water.  All scrambled as well as they could to the shore; but in a moment
2661,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,we saw with dismay that one of the ladies was floating away on the
2662,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"retreating wave, and Thornton was plunging after the helpless form."
2663,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,Meanwhile the party on the parade had rushed frantically round to the
2664,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"bay, shouting and screaming as they came."
2665,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2666,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""Where's the life-buoy?"" shouted Captain O'Brien vaguely."
2667,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2668,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""Fetch the life-boat!"" cried Captain Kelly, in a voice of command,"
2669,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"although there was no one to fetch it, and, for aught he knew, the"
2670,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,nearest was in London.  The two Misses Bankes screamed at intervals like
2671,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,minute guns.  Mr. and Mrs. Delamere and their younger daughter looked on
2672,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"in speechless agony.  The young artist, like a sensible fellow, seized up"
2673,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,a coil of rope and dragged it towards the sea.  The colonel embraced Mrs.
2674,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,Bagshaw before the multitude.
2675,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2676,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""She will be drowned!"" cried one."
2677,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2678,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""She is saved!"" cried another."
2679,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2680,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"""He has caught her, thank God!  Well done!"" shrieked a third."
2681,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2682,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"Thornton had reached Florence, and was endeavouring to stagger back with"
2683,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"her in his arms; but the waves were too strong for him, and they both"
2684,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"fell, and were lost to sight in an enormous breaker, while everyone held"
2685,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,their breath.  As the wave dispersed three forms could be seen struggling
2686,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"forwards; and, amid the wildest cheers and excitement Hawkstone rolled"
2687,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"Thornton and his lady love upon the sand, and then threw himself on his"
2688,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,back quite out of breath.
2689,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,
2690,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,Florence neither heard nor saw anything for some time.  Captain Kelly
2691,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,suggested water as being the best restorative under the circumstances.
2692,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,Porkington wished he had not forgotten his brandy flask.  The doctor's
2693,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"son thought of bleeding, and played with a little pocket-knife in a"
2694,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"suggestive fashion.  On a sudden Glenville, who always had his wits about"
2695,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"him, discovered the Drag seated on a rock in a state of helpless terror,"
2696,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,and smelling at a bottle of aromatic vinegar as though her life was in
2697,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"danger.  ""Lend that to me--quick, Miss Candlish!"" he cried, and seized"
2698,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"the bottle.  The Drag struggled to keep possession of it, but in vain,"
2699,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,and then fainted away.  The young lady soon recovered sufficiently under
2700,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,the influence of the smelling bottle to walk home with the assistance of
2701,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,Thornton and Mrs. Delamere.  The rest of the party began to separate amid
2702,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,much talking and laughter; for as soon as the danger was passed the whole
2703,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"thing seemed to be a joke; and we had so much to talk of, that we hardly"
2704,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,noticed how we got away.  But on looking back I observed that the young
2705,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"artist brought up the rear with Miss Bagshaw, and was evidently being"
2706,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,most attentive.  Hawkstone received everybody's thanks and praise in a
2707,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,"simple, good-humoured way, and proceeded to fasten up the boat out of"
2708,CHAPTER IV.--BOATING.,reach of the tide.

2715,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"Mrs. Porkington, attired in the white silk which we all knew so well,"
2716,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"reclined upon the sofa.  Porkington, who was, or should be, her lord and"
2717,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"master, was perched upon the music stool.  The Drag, in a pink muslin of"
2718,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"a draggled description, sat in a deep easy chair, displaying a great deal"
2719,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,of skinny ancle and large feet.
2720,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2721,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""It has always surprised me, my dear,"" said Mrs. Porkington, ""how fond"
2722,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"you are of dancing."""
2723,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2724,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""Why, what can you mean?"" said he.  ""Why, I never danced in my life."""
2725,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2726,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""Oh, of course not,"" replied she.  ""I am aware you cannot dance, nor did"
2727,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"I insinuate that you could, my dear, nor did I say so that I am aware."
2728,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"But you enjoy these balls so much, you know you do."""
2729,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2730,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""Well, yes,"" he said, languidly, ""I like to see the young folks enjoy"
2731,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"themselves."""
2732,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2733,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""Now, for my part,"" said his wife, ""I am sure I am getting quite tired,"
2734,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"and wish the balls were at an end."""
2735,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2736,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""My dear, I am sure I thought you liked them, or I would never have taken"

2738,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2739,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""Now, my dear, my dear, I must beg, I must entreat, that you will not"

2741,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,sure I have never been asked to be taken to one of the balls this
2742,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"season."""
2743,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2744,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"When a man tells a lie, it is with some hope, however slight, that he may"
2745,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,not be found out; but a woman will lie to the very person whom she knows
2746,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,to be as fully acquainted with the facts as she is herself.  Which is the
2747,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,more deadly sin I leave to the Jesuits.
2748,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2749,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""I am sure,"" said the Coach, making a desperate effort, ""you appeared to"
2750,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"enjoy them, for you danced a great many dances."""
2751,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2752,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""Aunt!"" exclaimed the lady, ""is it true that I always dance every dance?"""
2753,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2754,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""No indeed!"" chimed in Miss Candlish, ""far from it.  No doubt you would"
2755,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"get partners for all if you wished."""
2756,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2757,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""And is it true,"" she continued, ""that I wish to go to these ridiculous"

2761,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2762,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""In that case I can dispose of your ticket,"" said he.  Unlucky man!  In"
2763,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,these cases there is no _via media_.  A man should either resist to the
2764,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,death or submit with as good a grace as he can.  Half measures are fatal.
2765,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2766,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""No, my dear, you cannot dispose of that ticket,"" said his wife, ""and I"
2767,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,take it as very unkind in you to speak to Aunt in that manner.  It is not
2768,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"because she is poor, and dependent upon us, that she is to be sneered at"
2769,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"and ill-treated.""  At this speech the Drag burst into tears, and declared"
2770,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,that she always knew that Mr. Porkington hated her; that she might be
2771,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"poor and old and ugly, etc., etc., but she little expected to be called"
2772,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"so by him; that she would not go to the ball now, if he implored her on"
2773,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"his knees, and so on, and so on."
2774,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2775,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"Now, who could have thought it?  All this fuss was occasioned by Mr. P."
2776,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,having meanly backed out of giving Mrs. P. a new dress in which to
2777,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,electrify the fashionable world at Babbicombe.  Ah me!  Let us hope that
2778,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,in some far distant planet there may be some better world where all
2779,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"unfortunate creatures,--dogs which have had tin kettles tied to their"
2780,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"tails,--cockchafers which have been spun upon pins,--poor men who have"
2781,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"been over-crawed by wives, aunts, mothers-in-law, and other"
2782,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"terrors,--donkeys which have been undeservedly belaboured by"
2783,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"costermongers,--and authors who have been meritoriously abused by"
2784,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"critics,--rest together in peace in a sort of happy family."
2785,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2786,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"At this point Barton, Glenville, Thornton, and I all entered the room."
2787,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2788,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""Oh, I am so glad to see the ladies are ready,"" said Thornton.  ""This"
2789,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"will be our last ball, and we ought to make a happy evening of it.  Are"
2790,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"you not sorry we are coming to the end of our gaieties, Miss Candlish?"""
2791,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2792,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""Sorry!"" exclaimed the Drag, ferociously.  ""Sorry!  I never was more"
2793,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"pleased--pleased--pleased!""  Every time she repeated the word ""pleased"""
2794,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"she launched it at the head of the unfortunate tutor, as if she hoped her"
2795,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,words would turn into brickbats ere they reached him.
2796,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2797,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""I am glad to see you are going, however,"" said Glenville."
2798,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2799,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""There you are mistaken,"" said the Aunt, ""for Mr. Porkington has been so"
2800,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"very kind as to say he had rather I did not go."""
2801,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2802,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""Really, really,"" cried Porkington, ""I can assure you it is quite the"

2804,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2805,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""Oh, pray do not disappoint us in our last evening together, Miss"
2806,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"Candlish,"" said Glenville, coming to the rescue of the unfortunate tutor,"
2807,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"and speaking in his most fascinating manner, ""I have hoped for the"
2808,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"pleasure of a quadrille and lancers and"" (with an effort) ""a waltz with"
2809,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"you this evening if you will allow me."""
2810,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2811,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"The Drag became calm, and after a little while diplomatic relations were"
2812,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"fairly established, and away we all went to the Assembly Rooms, Glenville"
2813,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"whispering to me and Barton, ""I have made up my mind to get rid of that"
2814,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"pink muslin to-night or perish in the attempt.""  I had no opportunity at"
2815,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"the moment of asking him what he meant, but I was sure he meant mischief."
2816,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"However, I never gave the matter a second thought, as the business of"
2817,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,dancing soon commenced.  Captains O'Brien and Kelly were already waltzing
2818,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"with the two Misses Bankes, and whispering delightful nothings into their"
2819,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,curls as we entered.  The artist was floundering in a persevering manner
2820,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"with pretty Miss Bagshaw, and the doctor was standing in the doorway"
2821,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,ruminating hopefully on the probable effects of low dresses and cold
2822,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"draughts.  Thornton was soon engrossed in the charms of his lady love,"
2823,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"and Barton, Glenville, and I were doing our duty by all the young ladies."
2824,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"The room was well filled, and, though not well lighted nor well"
2825,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"appointed, was large and cheerful enough.  The German Band performed"
2826,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,prodigies; the row was simply deafening.  There were a few seats by the
2827,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"walls for those who did not dance, and there was a room for lemonade,"
2828,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"cakes, and bad ices for those who liked them, as well as a small room in"
2829,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,which the old fogies could play a rubber of whist.
2830,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2831,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"Mrs. Delamere had pinned Mr. Bankes in a corner, and was enlarging to him"
2832,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,upon one of her favourite topics.
2833,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2834,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""The Church of England,"" said she, ""is undoubtedly in great danger, but"
2835,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"why should we regret it?  It has become a thing of the past, and so have"
2836,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,chivalry and monasteries.  The mind of the nineteenth century is marching
2837,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,on to its goal.  The intellect of England is asserting itself.  I have
2838,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"ever loved the intellect of England, haven't you?"""
2839,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2840,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""Oh, quite so--ah, yes, certainly, of course!"" said Mr. Bankes."
2841,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2842,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""You agree with me,"" said Mrs. Delamere; ""I was sure you would.  This is"
2843,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,most delightful.  I have seldom talked with any true thinker who does not
2844,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"agree with me."""
2845,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2846,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""I am sure,"" said Mr. Bankes gallantly, ""no one would venture to cope"

2849,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""Perhaps not,"" she said complacently, ""but I should not desire to"
2850,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,disagree with anyone upon religious subjects.  The great desideratum--you
2851,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"see I understand the Latin tongue, Mr. Bankes--the great desideratum is"
2852,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,harmony--the harmony of the soul!  How are we to arrive at harmony? that

2861,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2862,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,Several of the dancers hastened into the card-room.  Mrs. Bagshaw was
2863,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"standing up flushed and excited, and talking loudly and wildly.  She had"
2864,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"overset her chair, and flung down her cards upon the table.  Seeing"
2865,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"Porkington enter, she cried out, ""Look to your wife, sir, look to your"
2866,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,wife.  She received signals across the table.  It has nothing to do with
2867,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,the cards.  Look at that man who is called my husband--that monster--that
2868,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"bundle of lies and deceit, who has been the ruin of hundreds."""
2869,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2870,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""By heavens, this is too bad!"" exclaimed Colonel Bagshaw.  ""I declare"

2874,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""It is a lie, sir, and you know it.  You are trying to ruin a woman"
2875,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"before my very eyes.  Oh, you man, you brute!  Oh, help, help me, help!"""
2876,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,and in act to fall she steadied herself by clenching tightly the back of
2877,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"her chair.  Her daughter was luckily close to her, ""Oh, mamma, mamma,"""
2878,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"whispered she, ""how can you say such things?  Come away, come away; you"
2879,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"are ill.  Do come.""  She led her out into the hall, and hurriedly"
2880,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"adjusting the shawls, went home with her mother."
2881,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2882,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"Porkington showed himself a man.  He took Colonel Bagshaw by the hand.  ""I"
2883,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"am very sorry,"" said he, ""that Mrs. Bagshaw should have made some"
2884,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"mistake.  Some sudden vexation, and I am afraid some indisposition, must"

2890,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2891,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,Mrs. Porkington during this scene had turned pale and red alternately.
2892,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,Her husband's dignity and presence of mind astonished her.  She was so
2893,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"excited as to be almost unable to play her cards, and her lips and eyes"
2894,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,betrayed very great emotion.  The tutor's cheek showed some trace of
2895,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"colour, and his manner was even graver than usual, but that was all; and"
2896,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"his wife felt the presence of a superior force to her own, and was"
2897,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,checked into silence.  I had always felt sure that there was a reserve of
2898,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,force in the timid nature of our Coach which seemed to peep forth at
2899,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,times and then retire again.  It was curious to mark on these rare
2900,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,occasions how the more boisterous self-assertion of Mrs. Porkington
2901,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,seemed for a time to cower before the gentler but finer will.  Natures
2902,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"are not changed in a day, but the effect of the singular scene which had"
2903,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"been enacted at that time was never effaced, and a gradual and mutual"
2904,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,approach was made between husband and wife towards a more cordial and
2905,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,complete sympathy.
2906,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2907,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"The music had not ceased playing during the disturbance, and the dancers,"
2908,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"with great presence of mind, quickly returned to their places, and the"
2909,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,usual frivolities of the evening continued to the accustomed hour of
2910,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"midnight, when the party began to break up.  I could not find Glenville"
2911,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,or Barton.  Where could they be?  Once or twice in the pauses of the
2912,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"dance I had noticed them talking earnestly together, and occasionally"
2913,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"with suppressed laughter.  ""Now, what joke are these fellows up to, I"
2914,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"wonder?""  However, it was not my business to inquire, though I had a kind"
2915,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,of fear that the combination of gunpowder with lucifer matches in a high
2916,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,temperature could hardly be more dangerous than the meeting of Glenville
2917,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,and Barton in a mischievous mood.  Before the last dance had commenced
2918,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"they had left the hall, and, as soon as they got outside, they found Miss"
2919,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,Candlish's sedan chair in the custody of the two men who usually carried
2920,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"her to and fro when she attended the balls.  Two other sedan chairs,"
2921,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"several bath chairs and donkey chairs, and a couple of flys were in"
2922,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"attendance.  Aided by the magical influence of a small ""tip,"" Glenville"
2923,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,easily persuaded the men in charge that the dance would not be over for a
2924,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"few minutes, and that they had time to go and get a glass of beer, which,"
2925,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"he said, Miss Candlish wished them to have in return for the care and"
2926,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,trouble they had several times taken in carrying her home.  As soon as
2927,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"they had gone, he and Barton came back into the ball-room; and, as the"
2928,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"last dance was coming to an end, and the band was beginning to scramble"
2929,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"through ""God save the Queen,"" in a most disloyal manner, he came up to"
2930,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"Miss Candlish, and said, ""May I have the pleasure of seeing you to your"
2931,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"chair, and thanking you for that very delightful dance?"""
2932,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2933,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""My dear Mr. Glenville,"" said the Drag, ""your politeness is quite"
2934,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"overpowering.  Ah, if all young men were like you, what a very different"
2935,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"world it would be."""
2936,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2937,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""You must not flatter me,"" said Glenville, ""for I am very soft hearted,"
2938,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"especially where the fair sex is concerned."""
2939,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2940,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""Ah, how I wish I had a son like you!"" sighed the Drag."
2941,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2942,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"""And how I wish you were my m--m--mother!"" replied that villain"
2943,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"Glenville, as he adjusted her cloak, and led her out to her chair.  It"
2944,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"was pitchy dark outside (only a couple of candle lanterns to see by), and"
2945,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,the usual confusion upon the breaking up of a large party was taking
2946,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"place.  Miss Candlish stepped into her chair, and the door was closed."
2947,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"Glenville and Barton took up the chair, and, going as smoothly as they"
2948,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"could (which was not as smoothly as the usual carriers), they turned"
2949,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"aside from the main stream of the visitors, and made at once for the"
2950,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"harbour.  Here they had intended to deposit the chair, and leave the rest"
2951,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"to fate; but, as luck would have it, in setting down the chair in the"
2952,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"darkness, one side of it projected over a sort of landing-place.  It"
2953,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,toppled over and fell sideways with a splash into the muddy water.  Scream
2954,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"upon scream followed rapidly.  ""Murder! thieves! help!""  Shriek after"
2955,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"shriek, and at last a female form, wildly flinging her arms into the air,"
2956,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,could be seen emerging from the half buried chair.  Glenville and Barton
2957,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"had run away before the chair fell, but, hearing the fall, looked back,"
2958,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"and were at first spellbound with terror at what had happened.  When,"
2959,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"however, they saw the Drag emerge, they fairly fled for their lives by a"
2960,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"circuitous way little frequented by night, and reached home just before"
2961,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,the rest of us arrived.  There was some alarm when Miss Candlish did not
2962,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,arrive for about twenty minutes or half an hour.  Glenville and Barton
2963,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"told Thornton and myself what had happened, and wanted to know what they"
2964,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"should do.  Of course, we advised that they should say and do nothing,"
2965,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"but wait upon the will of the Fates.  They were in a great fright, and"
2966,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,when Miss Candlish arrived in charge of two policemen their terror became
2967,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,wild.  And yet they both said afterwards that they could hardly help
2968,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,laughing out loud.  The pink muslin was draggled and besmeared with
2969,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"harbour mud, and torn half out of the gathers.  Its owner was in a state"
2970,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"of rage, terror, and hysterics.  The commotion was fearful.  It was very"
2971,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,strange she did not seem to have the faintest suspicion of any of our
2972,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,party.  She was sure the men were drunk because they carried her so
2973,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,unsteadily.  She was positive they meant to rob her or something worse.
2974,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,She saw them as they were running away.  They were the very same men who
2975,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,always carried her.  She never could bear those men.  They looked more
2976,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,like demons than men.  She would leave the place next day.  She had been
2977,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"disgraced.  Everybody hated her, nobody had any pity.  She would go to"
2978,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"bed.  Don't speak to her--go away--go away, do!  Brandy and water,"
2979,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,certainly not! and so on.  Till at last Mrs. Porkington prevailed on her
2980,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,to go to bed.  We had all vanished as quickly as we could and smoked a
2981,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"pipe, discussing in low tones the lowering appearance of the skies above"
2982,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"us, and the consequences which might ensue upon those inquiries which we"
2983,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,foresaw must inevitably take place.
2984,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,
2985,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"I never quite knew how it was managed, but two policemen came the next"
2986,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"morning and actually examined our boots and trousers, and then had a long"
2987,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"interview with Mr. Porkington; and finally we, who were waiting in terror"
2988,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"in the dining-room, saw the pair of them go out of the front door,"
2989,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,touching their hats to Porkington.  I thought at the time that he must
2990,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"have bribed them; but afterwards, on thinking it over, I came to the"
2991,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,conclusion that there was no evidence of the complicity of our party.  Of
2992,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"course, the sedan men did not know what had happened.  Porkington stoutly"
2993,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"refused to let the policemen come into our study, and told them he should"
2994,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,regard them as trespassers if they ventured to go into any other room.
2995,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"The Drag, although she declared she knew the two men, had no desire to"
2996,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,bring the matter before the public.  Porkington never said a word to any
2997,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"of us upon the subject, though he looked cross and nervous.  As soon as"
2998,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,the aunt had taken her departure (which she did the next day) he quite
2999,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"recovered his good humour, and, I believe, even chuckled inwardly at the"
3000,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,episode.  The _Babbicombe Independent_ had an amusing paragraph upon the
3001,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"incident, and opined that some drunken sailors from one of the"
3002,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,neighbouring ports were the perpetrators of the coarse practical joke;
3003,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,but we found that the general opinion among the visitors was not so wide
3004,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,"of the truth.  However, as no one cared for the lady it took less than"
3005,CHAPTER V.--THE BALL.,nine days to get rid of the wonder.

3010,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3011,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3012,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""Barton,"" said Glenville, ""I want to speak to you, old chap.  You won't"
3013,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"mind me speaking to you, will you?"""
3014,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3015,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"Barton's brow clouded at once.  He knew what was coming.  ""I don't know"
3016,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"what you mean,"" said he."
3017,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3018,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""Well, I want to talk to you about that girl."""
3019,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3020,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""What right have you to interfere?  That's my business, not yours."""
3021,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3022,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""If you are going to be angry, I'll shut up.  But I tell you plainly,"
3023,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,it's a beastly shame; and if you dare to do any harm to her I'll kick you
3024,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"out of the place."""
3025,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3026,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""Out of what place?"""
3027,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3028,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""Why, out of this or any other place I find you in.  You've no right to"
3029,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"go meeting her as you do."""
3030,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3031,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""And you've no right to speak of her like that.  She is as pure as any"
3032,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"child in the world, and you ought to know I would do her no harm.  You"
3033,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"are trying to insult both me and her."""
3034,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3035,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""Well, I'm very glad to hear you say so.  But, see what folly it all is."
3036,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"You know you don't intend to marry her.  Do you?"""
3037,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3038,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""Why, as to that I don't know.  I'm not obliged to tell you what I mean"
3039,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"to do."""
3040,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3041,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""No; but you ought to think about what you mean to do.  You know she is"
3042,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"engaged to be married to Hawkstone."""
3043,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3044,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""Yes; but I don't think she cares for him a bit--only to tease him."""
3045,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3046,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""Do just think what you are doing as a man and a gentleman--I won't say"
3047,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"as a Christian, for you tell me you mean nothing bad.  But is it manly,"
3048,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,is it fair to play these sort of tricks?  I must tell you we must give up
3049,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"being chums any longer if this goes on."""
3050,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3051,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""I tell you what, Glenville, I think you are giving yourself mighty fine"
3052,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"airs, and all about nothing; but just because you have an uncle who is a"
3053,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"lord you think you may preach as much as you like."""
3054,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3055,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""Oh, come now, that's all nonsense!"" said Glenville.  ""If you are"
3056,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"determined to shut me up, I've done.  _Liberavi animam meam_.  I am sorry"
3057,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,if I have offended you.  I say it's quite time we went to join the other
3058,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"fellows.  They want us to go with some of the ladies over the cliffs."""
3059,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3060,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""Thanks, I can't come.  I've a lot more work to do, and--and I've hurt my"
3061,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"heel a bit and don't care to go a stiff climb to-day."""
3062,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3063,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"Glenville looked at him, and saw a red glow rising in his neck as he"
3064,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"turned away his face and sat down to a book on the table, pretending to"
3065,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"read, as Glenville left the room."
3066,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3067,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"The sky was dark, and ominous of storm.  It had a torn and ragged"
3068,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"appearance, as if it had already had a fight with worse weather and was"
3069,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,trying to escape.  The sea-gulls showed like white breakers upon the dark
3070,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"sky.  The waves roared and grumbled, lashing themselves into a fury as"
3071,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"they burst in white, wrathful foam against the black rocks, and then drew"
3072,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"back, torn and mangled, to mingle with the crowd of waves rushing on to"
3073,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"their doom.  The visitors, dressed for squally weather, in waterproofs or"
3074,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"rough suits, walked up and down the parade, enjoying the exhilarating"
3075,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"breeze, or stood watching with eager excitement the entry of a fishing"
3076,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,smack into the harbour.  Far away out at sea in the mist of distant spray
3077,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,and rain two or three brigantines or schooners could be dimly descried
3078,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,labouring with the storm;--mysterious and awful sight as it always seems
3079,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,to me.  Will she get safe to port?  What is her cargo?  What her human
3080,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,freight?  What are they doing or thinking?  What language do they speak?
3081,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"Are there women or children aboard?  Who knows?  Ah, gentle reader, what"
3082,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"do you and I know of each other, and what do we know of even our nearest"
3083,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,friends; to what port are they struggling through the mists which envelop
3084,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"them, and who will meet them on the shore?"
3085,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3086,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,An hour had not elapsed since Glenville had left Barton before the latter
3087,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,had reached the first promontory of rocks which shut in the little bay of
3088,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"Babbicombe, and on turning the corner found, as he had expected and"
3089,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"appointed, the young woman who had been the subject of their angry"
3090,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"conversation.  She rose from a rock on which she had been sitting, and"
3091,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"came to meet him with a frank smile, saying, ""Good afternoon, Mr. Henry."""
3092,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,Somehow the slightly coarse intonation struck him as it had never done
3093,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"before, and the freedom of manner which a few hours ago would have"
3094,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"delighted him now sent a chilling sensation to his heart.  ""Good"
3095,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"afternoon,"" he replied, and, drawing his arm round her waist, he kissed"
3096,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"her several times, and held her so firmly that at last she said, ""Oh,"
3097,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"sir, you'll hurt me.  Let me go!""  Then holding him away from her, and"
3098,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"looking him full in the face, she said, ""Oh, Mr. Henry, whatever can be"
3099,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"the matter!""  ""Come and sit down, darling,"" he said, ""I want to say"
3100,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"something to you.""  He led her to a seat upon the rocks, and they both"
3101,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"sat down.  ""Darling,"" he said, ""I am afraid I must go away at once and"
3102,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"leave you for ever.""  ""Oh, no, no, no! not that!"" she cried, starting up."
3103,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"In a moment her manner changed from fear to anger.  ""I know what it is!"""
3104,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"she exclaimed, ""Hawkstone has been rude to you.  There now, I will never"
3105,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"forgive him.  I will never be friends with him again--never!"""
3106,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3107,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""No, darling, it is nothing about Hawkstone at all.  I haven't seen him."
3108,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"But come here, you must be quiet and listen to what I have to say."""
3109,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3110,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,She sat down again beside him.  Her lips quivered.  Her blue eyes were
3111,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"staring into the cliff in front of her, but she saw nothing, felt"
3112,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"nothing, except that a dreadful moment had come which she had for some"
3113,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"time dimly expected, but never distinctly foreseen."
3114,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3115,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""I hardly know how to tell you,"" he began.  ""You know I love you very"
3116,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"dearly, and if I could--if it was possible, I would ask you to marry me."
3117,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"But I cannot.  It is impossible.  It would bring misery upon all, upon my"
3118,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"father and mother, and upon you.  How can I make you understand?  My"
3119,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"people are rich, all their friends are rich, and all very proud."""
3120,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3121,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"The tears were streaming down her face, and she sat motionless."
3122,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3123,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""But I don't want to know your friends,"" she said, in a choking voice."
3124,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3125,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""I know, I know,"" he said, ""and I could be quite happy with you if they"
3126,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"were all dead and out of the way, and if the world was different from"
3127,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"what it is.  But I have thought it all out, and I am sure I ought to go"
3128,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"away at once, and never come back again."""
3129,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3130,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"There was a long pause, but at last she rose and said, ""Mr. Barton, I"
3131,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"have felt that something of this sort might happen, but I have never"
3132,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"thought it out, as you say you have.  I am confused now it has come, just"
3133,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"as if I had never feared it beforehand.  I was very, very happy, and I"
3134,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,would not think of what might come of it.  I might have known that a
3135,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,grand gentleman like you would never live with the like of me; but then I
3136,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"thought I loved you very, very dearly; you seemed so bright, and grand,"
3137,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"and tender, that I loved you in spite of all I was afraid of, and I"
3138,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"thought if you loved me you might perhaps be--""  Here she broke down"
3139,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"altogether, and burst into sobs, and seemed as though she would fall.  He"
3140,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"rose and threw his arms round her, led her back to the rock, called her"
3141,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"all the sweet names he could think of, kissed her again and again, and"
3142,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"tried to soothe her; while she, poor thing, could do nothing but sob,"
3143,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,with her head upon his shoulder.
3144,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3145,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"A loud shout aroused them.  They both rose suddenly, and turned their"
3146,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,faces towards the place whence the sound proceeded.  Hawkstone was just
3147,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"emerging from the surf, which was lashing furiously against the corner of"
3148,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"the cliff, round which they had come dry-shod a short time before, They"
3149,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"at once guessed their fate, and glanced in dismay at one another and then"
3150,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"at the sea, and again at Hawkstone, who rapidly approached them, drenched"
3151,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"through and through, and in a fierce state of wrath and terror, added to"
3152,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,the excitement of his struggle with the waves.
3153,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3154,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""What are you doing here?"" he cried, and in the same breath, ""Don't"
3155,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"answer--don't dare to answer, but listen.  You are caught by the tide.  I"
3156,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,have sent a boy back to Babbicombe for help.  No help can come by sea in
3157,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,such a storm.  They will bring a basket and ropes by the cliff.  It will
3158,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"be a race between them and the tide.  If all goes well, they will be here"
3159,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"in time.  If not, we shall all be drowned."""
3160,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3161,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""Is there no way up the cliff?"" said Barton."
3162,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3163,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""None.  The cliff overhangs.  There is a place where I have just come"
3164,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"through, but I doubt if I could reach it again; and I am sure neither of"
3165,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"you could stand the surf.  You must wait.""  He then turned from them, and"
3166,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"sat himself down on a fallen piece of the cliff, and buried his face in"
3167,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,his hands.  Nellie sank down on the rock where she and Barton had been
3168,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"sitting, and he stood by her, helplessly gazing alternately with a pale"
3169,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,face and bewildered mind at his two companions.  Two or three minutes
3170,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,passed without any motion or sound from the living occupants of the bay;
3171,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"but the roaring of the sea grew louder and louder, and the terror of it"
3172,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"sank into the hearts of all three.  At last Hawkstone raised his head,"
3173,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,and immediately Barton approached him.
3174,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3175,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""Forgive me, Hawkstone,"" he said, ""I have done you a great wrong, and I"
3176,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"am sorry for it."""
3177,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3178,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""What's the good in saying that?  You can't mend the wrong you have"
3179,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"done,"" and his head sank down again between his hands."
3180,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3181,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,There was a pause.  Barton felt that what had been said was true and not
3182,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,true.  One of the most painful consequences of wrong-doing is that the
3183,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"wrong has a sort of fungus growth about it, and insists upon appearing"
3184,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,more wrong than it ever was meant to be.
3185,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3186,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""Hawkstone,"" he said at last, ""I swear to you, on my honour as a"
3187,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"gentleman, I have never dreamed of doing her an injury.  I have been"
3188,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"very, very foolish; I have come between you and her with my cursed folly."
3189,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,I deserve anything you may say or do to me.  I care nothing about the
3190,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"waves; let them come.  Take her with you up the cliff, and leave me to"
3191,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"drown.  It's all I'm fit for.  She will forget me soon enough, I feel"
3192,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"sure, for I am not worth remembering."""
3193,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3194,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"Hawkstone still kept himself bent down, his hands covering his face, and"
3195,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,his body swaying to and fro with his strong emotions.

3199,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,

3202,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3203,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""Yes!"" cried Hawkstone, springing up in a passion and towering above"
3204,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"Barton, with his hands tightly clenched and his chest heaving, ""Yes! you"
3205,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,are too great a coward for that.  In one moment I could crush you as I
3206,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"crush the mussels in the harbour with my heel."""
3207,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3208,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"Nelly threw herself upon him, ""Jack, spare him, spare him.  He meant no"
3209,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"harm.  Not now, not now!  The sea, Jack, the sea!  Save us, save us!"""
3210,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3211,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"The man's strength seemed to leave him, and she seemed to overpower him,"
3212,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"as he sank back into his former position, muttering ""O God, O God!""  At"
3213,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"last he said, ""Let be, let be--there, there, I've prayed I might not kill"
3214,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"you both, and the devil is gone, thank the Lord for it.  There, lass,"
3215,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"don't fret; I can't abide crying.  The sea! the sea!  Yes, the sea.  I"
3216,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,had almost forgotten it.  Cheer up a bit--fearful--how it blows--but
3217,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"there's time yet--a few minutes.  Keep up, keep up.  There's a God above"
3218,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"us anyway."""
3219,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3220,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"At this moment a shout was heard above them.  ""There they are at last,"""
3221,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"cried Hawkstone, and he sent a loud halloo up the cliff, which was"
3222,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"immediately responded to by those at the top, though the sound seemed"
3223,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"faint and far off.  After the lapse of about five minutes, a basket"
3224,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,attached to two ropes descended slowly and bumped upon the rocks.
3225,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3226,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""Now, lass, you get up first.  Come, come, give over crying.  It's no"
3227,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,time for crying now.  Be a brave lass or you'll fall out.  Sit down and
3228,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"keep tight hold.  Shut your eyes, never mind a bump or two, and keep"
3229,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"tight hold.  Now then!""  He lifted her into the basket.  She tried to"
3230,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"take his hand, but he drew it sharply away."
3231,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3232,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""Oh, forgive me, forgive me, Jack,"" she said, ""I have been very wicked,"
3233,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"but I will try to be good."""
3234,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3235,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""That's right, lass, that's right.  God keep you safe.  Hold on,"" and he"
3236,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"gave a shout up the cliff, and the basket began slowly to ascend.  The"
3237,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"two men gazed at it in silence till it reached the summit, when, with a"
3238,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"rapid swirl, it disappeared."
3239,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3240,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""Thank God, she is safe,"" said Hawkstone."
3241,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3242,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""Look, look!"" cried Barton, catching hold of Hawkstone in alarm.  ""Look"
3243,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"how fast the waves are coming.  They will be on us directly."""
3244,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3245,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""Yes,"" said Hawkstone, ""there will be barely time to get the two of us up"
3246,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,unless they make great haste.  I don't know why they don't lower at once.
3247,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"Something must have gone wrong with the rope, but they will do their"
3248,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"best, that's certain."""
3249,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3250,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"They waited in anxiety amounting to horror, as wave after wave, larger"
3251,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"and louder, roared at them, and rushed round the rocks on which they were"
3252,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"standing.  Presently down came the basket, plunging into the retreating"
3253,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,wave.
3254,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3255,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""Now, then, sir, in with you,"" said Hawkstone."
3256,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3257,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""No, you go first.  I will not go.  It is my fault you are here."""
3258,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3259,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""Nonsense, sir, there's no time for talk."""
3260,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3261,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""I will not go without you.  Let us both get in together."""
3262,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3263,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""The rope will hardly bear two.  Besides, I doubt if there is strength"
3264,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"enough above to pull us up.  Get in, get in."""
3265,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3266,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"Barton still hesitated.  ""I am afraid to leave you alone.  Promise me if"
3267,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"I go that you will not--.  I can't say what I mean, but if anything"
3268,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"happened to you I should be the cause of it."""
3269,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3270,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"""For shame, sir, shame.  I guess what you mean, but I have not forgotten"
3271,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"who made me, though I have been sorely tried.  In with you at once.""  He"
3272,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"suddenly lifted Barton up in his arms, and almost threw him into the"
3273,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"basket, raising a loud shout, upon which the basket again ascended the"
3274,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,cliff more rapidly than on the first occasion.  Hawkstone fell upon his
3275,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"knees at the base of the cliff, while the waves roared at him like wild"
3276,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,beasts held back from their victim.  He was alone with them and with the
3277,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,God in whom his simple faith taught him to trust as being mightier than
3278,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"all the waves.  Down came the basket with great rapidity, and Hawkstone"
3279,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,had a hard fight before he could drag it out from the waves and get into
3280,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"it.  Drenched from head to foot, and cold and trembling with excitement"
3281,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"and grief, he again shouted, and the basket once more ascended.  He"
3282,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"remembered no more.  A sudden faintness overcame him, and the first thing"
3283,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,he remembered was feeling himself borne along on a kind of extemporary
3284,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"litter, and hearing kind voices saying that he was ""coming to,"" and would"
3285,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,soon be all right again.
3286,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,
3287,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,Luckily there was no scandal.  It was thought quite natural that
3288,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"Hawkstone should be with Nelly, and Barton was supposed to have been"
3289,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"there by accident.  Of course, we knew what the real state of the case"
3290,CHAPTER VI.--THE SHORE.,"was, and were glad that Barton had got a good fright; but we kept our own"

3299,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,"Party broke up, and it only remains now for the writer of this veracious"
3300,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,narrative to disclose any information he may have subsequently obtained
3301,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,as to the fate of his characters.  Porkington still holds an honoured
3302,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,"position in the University, and still continues to take young men in the"
3303,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,summer vacation to such places as Mrs. Porkington considers sufficiently
3304,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,"invigorating to her constitution.  They grow better friends every year,"
3305,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,but the grey mare will always be the better horse.  One cause of
3306,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,difference has disappeared.  The Drag died very shortly after leaving
3307,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,"Babbicombe; not at all, I believe, in consequence of her ducking in the"
3308,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,"harbour; but, being of a peevish and ""worritting"" disposition, she had"
3309,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,worn herself out in her attempts to make other people's lives a burden to
3310,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,them.  I do not know what has become of Harry Barton; but I know that he
3311,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,"has never revisited Babbicombe, nor even written to the fair Nelly.  I"
3312,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,"suppose he is helping to manage his father's cotton mill, and will in due"
3313,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,course marry the daughter of a wealthy manufacturer.  Glenville has
3314,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,"become quite a rising barrister, popular in both branches of his"
3315,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,"profession, and has announced his fixed intention to remain happy and"
3316,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,"unmarried till his death.  Looking into the future, however, with the eye"
3317,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,"of a prophet, the present writer thinks he can see Glenville walking arm"
3318,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,"in arm with a tall, graceful lady, attended by two little girls to whom"
3319,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,"he is laughingly talking--but the dream fades from me, and I wonder will"
3320,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,"it ever come true.  Thornton, of course, married Miss Delamere (how could"
3321,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,"it be otherwise), but, alas! there are no children, and this unhappy want"
3322,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,"is hardly compensated by the indefatigable attentions of Mamma Delamere,"
3323,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,"who is never weary of condoling with that poor, desolate couple,"
3324,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,imploring them to resign themselves to the fate which has been assigned
3325,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,"to them, and to strengthen their minds by the principles of true"
3326,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,philosophy and the writings of great thinkers; by which she hopes they
3327,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,may acquire that harmony of the soul in private life which is so much to
3328,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,be desiderated in both politics and religion.  Nobody knows what she
3329,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,means.
3330,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,
3331,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,"Nelly was not forgiven for one whole year.  When she and Hawkstone met,"
3332,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,they used only the customary expressions of mere acquaintances; but
3333,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,lovers are known to make use of signals which are unperceived by the
3334,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,"outside world; and, after a year's skirmishing, a peace was finally"
3335,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,"concluded, and a happier couple than John Hawkstone and Nelly cannot be"
3336,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,"found in the whole country, and I am afraid to say how many of their"
3337,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,children are already tumbling about the boats in the harbour.

3339,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,"The colonel died, and Mrs. Bagshaw lamented his death most truly, and has"

3342,CHAPTER VII.--CONCLUSION.,breaking in white foam against the dark rocks have become quite the rage
