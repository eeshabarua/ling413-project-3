30,INTRODUCTION.,INTRODUCTION.
31,INTRODUCTION.,
32,INTRODUCTION.,
33,INTRODUCTION.,"ABRAHAM COWLEY was the son of Thomas Cowley, stationer, and citizen of"
34,INTRODUCTION.,"London in the parish of St. Michael le Querne, Cheapside.  Thomas Cowley"
35,INTRODUCTION.,"signed his will on the 24th of July, 1618, and it was proved on the 11th"
36,INTRODUCTION.,"of the next month by his widow, Thomasine.  He left six children, Peter,"
37,INTRODUCTION.,"Audrey, John, William, Katherine, and Thomas, with a child unborn for"
38,INTRODUCTION.,"whom the will made equal provision with the rest.  The seventh child,"
39,INTRODUCTION.,"born before the end of the same year, was named Abraham, and lived to"
40,INTRODUCTION.,take high place among the English Poets.
41,INTRODUCTION.,
42,INTRODUCTION.,The calm spirit of Cowley’s “Essays” was in all his life.  As he tells us
43,INTRODUCTION.,"in his Essay “On Myself,” even when he was a very young boy at school,"
44,INTRODUCTION.,"instead of running about on holidays and playing with his fellows, he was"
45,INTRODUCTION.,"wont to steal from them and walk into the fields, either alone with a"
46,INTRODUCTION.,"book or with some one companion, if he could find any of the same temper."
47,INTRODUCTION.,"He wrote verse when very young, and says, “I believe I can tell the"
48,INTRODUCTION.,particular little chance that filled my head first with such chimes of
49,INTRODUCTION.,verse as have never since left ringing there; for I remember when I began
50,INTRODUCTION.,"to read and to take some pleasure in it, there was wont to lie in my"
51,INTRODUCTION.,"mother’s parlour (I know not by what accident, for she herself never in"
52,INTRODUCTION.,"her life read any book but of devotion), but there was wont to lie"
53,INTRODUCTION.,"Spenser’s works.”  The delight in Spenser wakened all the music in him,"
54,INTRODUCTION.,"and in 1628, in his tenth year, he wrote a “Tragical Historie of Pyramus"
55,INTRODUCTION.,and Thisbe.”
56,INTRODUCTION.,
57,INTRODUCTION.,"In his twelfth year Cowley wrote another piece, also in sixteen stanzas,"
58,INTRODUCTION.,"with songs interspersed, which was placed first in the little volume of"
59,INTRODUCTION.,"_Poetical Blossoms_, _by A_. _C._, published in 1633.  It was a little"
60,INTRODUCTION.,"quarto of thirty-two leaves, with a portrait of the author, taken at the"
61,INTRODUCTION.,"age of thirteen.  This pamphlet, dedicated to the Dean of Westminster,"
62,INTRODUCTION.,"and with introductory verses by Cowley and two of his schoolfellows,"
63,INTRODUCTION.,"contained “Constantia and Philetus,” with the “Pyramus and Thisbe,”"
64,INTRODUCTION.,"written earlier, and three pieces written later, namely, two Elegies and"
65,INTRODUCTION.,“A Dream of Elysium.”  The inscription round the portrait describes
66,INTRODUCTION.,Cowley as a King’s Scholar of Westminster School; and “Pyramus and
67,INTRODUCTION.,"Thisbe” has a special dedication to the Head Master, Lambert Osbalston."
68,INTRODUCTION.,"As schoolboy, Cowley tells us that he read the Latin authors, but could"
69,INTRODUCTION.,not be made to learn grammar rules by rote.  He was a candidate at his
70,INTRODUCTION.,"school in 1636 for a scholarship at Cambridge, but was not elected.  In"
71,INTRODUCTION.,"that year, however, he went to Cambridge and obtained a scholarship at"
72,INTRODUCTION.,Trinity.
73,INTRODUCTION.,
74,INTRODUCTION.,Cowley carried to Cambridge and extended there his reputation as boy
75,INTRODUCTION.,poet.  In 1636 the “Poetical Blossoms” were re-issued with an appendix of
76,INTRODUCTION.,sixteen more pieces under the head of “Sylva.”  A third edition of the
77,INTRODUCTION.,“Poetical Blossoms” was printed in 1637—the year of Milton’s “Lycidas”
78,INTRODUCTION.,and of Ben Johnson’s death.  Cowley had written a five-act pastoral
79,INTRODUCTION.,"comedy, “Love’s Riddle,” while yet at school, and this was published in"
80,INTRODUCTION.,"1638.  In the same year, 1638, when Cowley’s age was twenty, a Latin"
81,INTRODUCTION.,"comedy of his, “Naufragium Joculare,” was acted by men of his College,"
82,INTRODUCTION.,"and in the same year printed, with a dedication to Dr. Comber, Dean of"
83,INTRODUCTION.,"Carlisle, who was Master of Trinity.  The poet Richard Crashaw, who was"
84,INTRODUCTION.,"about two years older than Cowley, and, having entered Pembroke Hall in"
85,INTRODUCTION.,"1632, became a Fellow of Peterhouse in 1637, sent Cowley a June present"
86,INTRODUCTION.,of two unripe apricots with pleasant verses of compliment on his own
87,INTRODUCTION.,"early ripeness, on his April–Autumn:—"
88,INTRODUCTION.,
89,INTRODUCTION.,"“Take them, and me, in them acknowledging"
90,INTRODUCTION.,How much my Summer waits upon thy Spring.”
91,INTRODUCTION.,
92,INTRODUCTION.,"Cowley was able afterwards to help Crashaw materially, and wrote some"
93,INTRODUCTION.,lines upon his early death.
94,INTRODUCTION.,
95,INTRODUCTION.,In 1639 Cowley took the degree of B.A.  In 1640 he was chosen a Minor
96,INTRODUCTION.,"Fellow, and in 1642 a Major Fellow, of Trinity, and he proceeded to his"
97,INTRODUCTION.,"M.A. in due course.  In March, 1641, when Prince Charles visited"
98,INTRODUCTION.,"Cambridge, a comedy called “The Guardian,” hastily written by Cowley, was"
99,INTRODUCTION.,acted at Trinity College for the Prince’s entertainment.  Cowley is said
100,INTRODUCTION.,also to have written during three years at Cambridge the greater part of
101,INTRODUCTION.,"his heroic poem on the history of David, the “Davideis.”  One of the"
102,INTRODUCTION.,occasional poems written at this time by Cowley was on the early and
103,INTRODUCTION.,"sudden death of his most intimate friend at the University, William"
104,INTRODUCTION.,"Hervey, to whom he was dearer than all but his brothers and sisters, and,"
105,INTRODUCTION.,says Cowley:
106,INTRODUCTION.,
107,INTRODUCTION.,"“Even in that we did agree,"
108,INTRODUCTION.,For much above myself I loved them too.”
109,INTRODUCTION.,
110,INTRODUCTION.,"Hervey and Cowley had walked daily together, and had spent nights in"
111,INTRODUCTION.,joint study of philosophy and poetry.  Hervey “had all the light of
112,INTRODUCTION.,"youth, of the fire none.”"
113,INTRODUCTION.,
114,INTRODUCTION.,"“With as much zeal, devotion, piety,"
115,INTRODUCTION.,He always lived as other saints do die.
116,INTRODUCTION.,"Still with his soul severe account he kept,"
117,INTRODUCTION.,Weeping all debts out ere he slept;
118,INTRODUCTION.,"Then down in peace and innocence he lay,"
119,INTRODUCTION.,"Like the sun’s laborious light,"
120,INTRODUCTION.,"Which still in water sets at night,"
121,INTRODUCTION.,Unsullied with the journey of the day.”
122,INTRODUCTION.,
123,INTRODUCTION.,Cowley’s friendship with this family affected the course of his life.  He
124,INTRODUCTION.,"received many kindnesses from his friend’s brother John Hervey, including"
125,INTRODUCTION.,"introduction to Henry Jermyn, one of the most trusted friends of Queen"
126,INTRODUCTION.,"Henrietta Maria, the friend who was created by her wish Baron Jermyn of"
127,INTRODUCTION.,"St. Edmondsbury, who was addressed by Charles I. as “Harry,” and was"
128,INTRODUCTION.,"created by Charles II., in April, 1660, Earl of St. Albans.  He was"
129,INTRODUCTION.,"described in Queen Henrietta’s time by a political scandal-monger, as"
130,INTRODUCTION.,"“something too ugly for a lady’s favourite, yet that is nothing to some.”"
131,INTRODUCTION.,"In 1643 Cowley was driven from Cambridge, and went to St. John’s College,"
132,INTRODUCTION.,Oxford.  To Oxford at the end of that year the king summoned a
133,INTRODUCTION.,"Parliament, which met on the 22nd of January, 1644.  This brought to"
134,INTRODUCTION.,"Oxford many peers and Royalists, who deserted the Parliament at"
135,INTRODUCTION.,Westminster for the king’s Parliament at Oxford.  It continued to sit
136,INTRODUCTION.,"until the 16th of April, by which time the king had found even his own"
137,INTRODUCTION.,"Parliament to be in many respects too independent.  In 1644 the queen,"
138,INTRODUCTION.,"about to become a mother, withdrew to Exeter from Oxford, against which"
139,INTRODUCTION.,an army was advancing; and the parting at Oxford proved to be the last
140,INTRODUCTION.,between her and her husband.  A daughter was born at Exeter on the 16th
141,INTRODUCTION.,of June.  Within two weeks afterwards the advance of an army towards
142,INTRODUCTION.,Exeter caused the queen to rise from her bed in a dangerous state of
143,INTRODUCTION.,"health, and, leaving her child in good keeping, escape to Plymouth, where"
144,INTRODUCTION.,she reached Pendennis Castle on the 29th of June.  On the 2nd of July the
145,INTRODUCTION.,king’s forces were defeated at Marston Moor.  On the 14th of July the
146,INTRODUCTION.,queen escaped from Falmouth to Brest.  After some rest at the baths of
147,INTRODUCTION.,"Bourbon, she went on to Paris, where she was lodged in the Louvre, and"
148,INTRODUCTION.,"well cared for.  Jermyn was still her treasurer, her minister, and the"
149,INTRODUCTION.,friend for whose counsel she cared most.
150,INTRODUCTION.,
151,INTRODUCTION.,It was into the service of this Lord Jermyn that Cowley had been
152,INTRODUCTION.,introduced through his friendship with the Herveys.  He went to Paris as
153,INTRODUCTION.,"Lord Jermyn’s secretary, had charge of the queen’s political"
154,INTRODUCTION.,"correspondence, ciphered and deciphered letters between Queen Henrietta"
155,INTRODUCTION.,"and King Charles, and was thus employed so actively under Lord Jermyn"
156,INTRODUCTION.,"that his work filled all his days, and many of his nights.  He was sent"
157,INTRODUCTION.,"also on journeys to Jersey, Scotland, Flanders, Holland, or wherever else"
158,INTRODUCTION.,the king’s troubles required his attendance.  In 1647 Cowley published
159,INTRODUCTION.,"his volume of forty-four love poems, called “The Mistress.”  He was"
160,INTRODUCTION.,"himself no gallant, neither paid court to ladies, nor married.  His love"
161,INTRODUCTION.,poetry was hypothetical; and of his life at this time he says: “Though I
162,INTRODUCTION.,was in a crowd of as good company as could be found anywhere; though I
163,INTRODUCTION.,was in business of great and honourable trust; though I ate at the best
164,INTRODUCTION.,"table, and enjoyed the best convenience for present subsistence that"
165,INTRODUCTION.,ought to be desired by a man of my condition in banishment and public
166,INTRODUCTION.,"distresses, yet I could not abstain from renewing my old schoolboy’s wish"
167,INTRODUCTION.,in a copy of verses to the same effect:—
168,INTRODUCTION.,
169,INTRODUCTION.,"“‘Well, then, I now do plainly see"
170,INTRODUCTION.,"This busy world and I shall ne’er agree,’ &c.,"
171,INTRODUCTION.,
172,INTRODUCTION.,and I never then proposed to myself any other advantage from his
173,INTRODUCTION.,"Majesty’s happy restoration, but the getting into some moderately"
174,INTRODUCTION.,"convenient retreat in the country, which I thought, in that case, I might"
175,INTRODUCTION.,"easily have compassed, as well as some others who, with no greater"
176,INTRODUCTION.,"probabilities or pretences, have arrived to extraordinary fortunes.”"
177,INTRODUCTION.,
178,INTRODUCTION.,"In 1654 Queen Henrietta, under influence of a new confessor, had left the"
179,INTRODUCTION.,"Louvre, and, with the little daughter born at Exeter, taken up her"
180,INTRODUCTION.,"quarters in a foundation of her own, at Chaillot, for nuns of the"
181,INTRODUCTION.,visitation of St. Mary.  Lord Jermyn having little use left for a
182,INTRODUCTION.,"secretary in Paris, Cowley in 1656, after twelve years’ service in"
183,INTRODUCTION.,"France, was sent to England that he might there live in the retirement he"
184,INTRODUCTION.,"preferred, and with the understanding that he would be able to send"
185,INTRODUCTION.,information upon the course of home affairs.  In England he was presently
186,INTRODUCTION.,"seized by mistake for another man, and, when his name and position were"
187,INTRODUCTION.,"known, he was imprisoned, until a friendly physician, Sir Charles"
188,INTRODUCTION.,"Scarborough, undertook to be security in a thousand pounds for his good"
189,INTRODUCTION.,"conduct.  In this year, 1656, Cowley published the first folio volume of"
190,INTRODUCTION.,"his Poems, prepared in prison, and suggested, he said, by his finding,"
191,INTRODUCTION.,"when he returned to England, a book called “The Iron Age,” which had been"
192,INTRODUCTION.,"published as his, and caused him to wonder that any one foolish enough to"
193,INTRODUCTION.,write such bad verses should yet be so wise as to publish them under
194,INTRODUCTION.,another man’s name.  Cowley thought then that he had taken leave of
195,INTRODUCTION.,"verse, which needed less troubled times for its reading, and a mind less"
196,INTRODUCTION.,"troubled in the writer.  He left out of his book, he said, the pieces"
197,INTRODUCTION.,"written during the Civil War, including three books of the Civil War"
198,INTRODUCTION.,"itself, reaching as far as the first battle of Newbury.  These he had"
199,INTRODUCTION.,"burnt, for, he said, “I would have it accounted no less unlawful to rip"
200,INTRODUCTION.,up old wounds than to give new ones.”  “When the event of battle and the
201,INTRODUCTION.,"unaccountable Will of God has determined the controversy, and that we"
202,INTRODUCTION.,"have submitted to the will of the conqueror, we must lay down our pens as"
203,INTRODUCTION.,well as arms.”  The first part of this folio contained early poems; the
204,INTRODUCTION.,second part “The Mistress;” the third part “Pindaric Odes;” and the
205,INTRODUCTION.,fourth and last his “Davideis.”
206,INTRODUCTION.,
207,INTRODUCTION.,"In September of the following year, 1657, Cowley acted as best man to"
208,INTRODUCTION.,"George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, on his marriage at Bolton Percy, to"
209,INTRODUCTION.,Fairfax’s daughter; Cowley wrote also a sonnet for the bride.  In
210,INTRODUCTION.,"December he obtained, by influence of friends, the degree of M.D. from"
211,INTRODUCTION.,"the University of Oxford, and retired into Kent to study botany.  Such"
212,INTRODUCTION.,"study caused him then to write a Latin poem upon Plants, in six books:"
213,INTRODUCTION.,"the first two on Herbs, in elegiac verse; the next two on Flowers, in"
214,INTRODUCTION.,"various measures; and the last two on Trees, in heroic"
215,INTRODUCTION.,"numbers:—“_Plantarum_, _Libri VI_.”"
216,INTRODUCTION.,
217,INTRODUCTION.,"After the death of Cromwell, Cowley returned to France, but he came back"
218,INTRODUCTION.,"to England in 1660, when he published an “Ode on His Majesty’s"
219,INTRODUCTION.,"Restoration and Return,” and “A Discourse by way of Vision concerning the"
220,INTRODUCTION.,"Government of Oliver Cromwell.”  He was admitted, as Dr. Cowley, among"
221,INTRODUCTION.,the first members of the Royal Society then founded; but he was excluded
222,INTRODUCTION.,"from the favour of the king.  He had written an “Ode to Brutus,” for"
223,INTRODUCTION.,"which, said his Majesty, it was enough for Mr. Cowley to be forgiven.  A"
224,INTRODUCTION.,"noble lord replied to Cowley’s Ode, in praise of Brutus, with an Ode"
225,INTRODUCTION.,"against that Rebel.  Cowley’s old friend, Lord Jermyn, now made Earl of"
226,INTRODUCTION.,"St. Alban’s, joined, however, with George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham,"
227,INTRODUCTION.,in providing for the poet all that was required to secure to him the
228,INTRODUCTION.,quiet life that he desired.  Provision to such end had been promised him
229,INTRODUCTION.,"both by Charles I. and Charles II., in the definite form of the office of"
230,INTRODUCTION.,"Master of the Savoy, but the post was given by Charles II. to a brother"
231,INTRODUCTION.,of one of his mistresses.
232,INTRODUCTION.,
233,INTRODUCTION.,"Cowley recast his old comedy of “The Guardian,” and produced it in"
234,INTRODUCTION.,"December, 1661, as “Cutter of Coleman Street.”  It was played for a week"
235,INTRODUCTION.,"to a full audience, though some condemned it on the supposition it was a"
236,INTRODUCTION.,satire upon the king’s party.  Cowley certainly was too pure and
237,INTRODUCTION.,thoughtful to be a fit associate for Charles II. and many of his friends.
238,INTRODUCTION.,The help that came from the Earl of St. Albans and the Duke of
239,INTRODUCTION.,"Buckingham, was in the form of such a lease of the Queen’s lands as gave"
240,INTRODUCTION.,the poet a sufficient income.  Others who had served little were
241,INTRODUCTION.,"enriched; but he was set at ease, and sought no more.  He then made his"
242,INTRODUCTION.,"home by the Thames, first at Barn Elms, and afterwards at Chertsey, at"
243,INTRODUCTION.,"which latter place he lived for about a year in the Porch House, that yet"
244,INTRODUCTION.,stands.  Cowley was living at Chertsey when a July evening in damp
245,INTRODUCTION.,"meadows gave him a cold, of which he died within a fortnight.  That was"
246,INTRODUCTION.,"in the year 1667, year also of the death of Jeremy Taylor, and of the"
247,INTRODUCTION.,birth of Jonathan Swift.
248,INTRODUCTION.,
249,INTRODUCTION.,"Abraham Cowley is at his truest in these ESSAYS, written during the last"
250,INTRODUCTION.,"seven years of his life.  Their style is simple, and their thoughts are"
251,INTRODUCTION.,"pure.  They have, for their keynote, the happiness of one who loves true"
252,INTRODUCTION.,"liberty in quiet possession of himself.  When he turns to the Latins, his"
253,INTRODUCTION.,translations are all from those lines which would have dwelt most
254,INTRODUCTION.,pleasantly upon a mind that to the last held by the devout wish expressed
255,INTRODUCTION.,"by himself in a poem of his early youth—(_A Vote_, in “Sylva”):"
256,INTRODUCTION.,
257,INTRODUCTION.,"“Books should, not business, entertain the light,"
258,INTRODUCTION.,"And sleep, as undisturbed as death, the night."
259,INTRODUCTION.,My house a cottage more
260,INTRODUCTION.,"Than palace, and should fitting be"
261,INTRODUCTION.,"For all my use, no luxury."
262,INTRODUCTION.,"My garden, painted o’er"
263,INTRODUCTION.,"With Nature’s hand, not Art’s, should pleasures yield,"
264,INTRODUCTION.,Horace might envy in his Sabine field.”

271,OF LIBERTY.,OF LIBERTY.
272,OF LIBERTY.,
273,OF LIBERTY.,
274,OF LIBERTY.,THE liberty of a people consists in being governed by laws which they
275,OF LIBERTY.,"have made themselves, under whatsoever form it be of government; the"
276,OF LIBERTY.,"liberty of a private man in being master of his own time and actions, as"
277,OF LIBERTY.,far as may consist with the laws of God and of his country.  Of this
278,OF LIBERTY.,"latter only we are here to discourse, and to inquire what estate of life"
279,OF LIBERTY.,does best suit us in the possession of it.  This liberty of our own
280,OF LIBERTY.,"actions is such a fundamental privilege of human nature, that God"
281,OF LIBERTY.,"Himself, notwithstanding all His infinite power and right over us,"
282,OF LIBERTY.,"permits us to enjoy it, and that, too, after a forfeiture made by the"
283,OF LIBERTY.,rebellion of Adam.  He takes so much care for the entire preservation of
284,OF LIBERTY.,"it to us, that He suffers neither His providence nor eternal decree to"
285,OF LIBERTY.,"break or infringe it.  Now for our time, the same God, to whom we are but"
286,OF LIBERTY.,"tenants-at-will for the whole, requires but the seventh part to be paid"
287,OF LIBERTY.,"to Him at as a small quit-rent, in acknowledgment of His title.  It is"
288,OF LIBERTY.,"man only that has the impudence to demand our whole time, though he"
289,OF LIBERTY.,"neither gave it, nor can restore it, nor is able to pay any considerable"
290,OF LIBERTY.,value for the least part of it.  This birthright of mankind above all
291,OF LIBERTY.,"other creatures some are forced by hunger to sell, like Esau, for bread"
292,OF LIBERTY.,and broth; but the greatest part of men make such a bargain for the
293,OF LIBERTY.,"delivery up of themselves, as Thamar did with Judah; instead of a kid,"
294,OF LIBERTY.,"the necessary provisions for human life, they are contented to do it for"
295,OF LIBERTY.,rings and bracelets.  The great dealers in this world may be divided into
296,OF LIBERTY.,"the ambitious, the covetous, and the voluptuous; and that all these men"
297,OF LIBERTY.,sell themselves to be slaves—though to the vulgar it may seem a Stoical
298,OF LIBERTY.,paradox—will appear to the wise so plain and obvious that they will
299,OF LIBERTY.,scarce think it deserves the labour of argumentation.  Let us first
300,OF LIBERTY.,"consider the ambitious; and those, both in their progress to greatness,"
301,OF LIBERTY.,and after the attaining of it.  There is nothing truer than what Sallust
302,OF LIBERTY.,"says: “_Dominationis in alios servitium suum_, _mercedem dant_”: They are"
303,OF LIBERTY.,content to pay so great a price as their own servitude to purchase the
304,OF LIBERTY.,domination over others.  The first thing they must resolve to sacrifice
305,OF LIBERTY.,"is their whole time; they must never stop, nor ever turn aside whilst"
306,OF LIBERTY.,"they are in the race of glory; no, not like Atalanta for golden apples;"
307,OF LIBERTY.,"“Neither indeed can a man stop himself, if he would, when he is in this,"
308,OF LIBERTY.,career.  _Fertur equis auriga neque audit currus habenas_.”
309,OF LIBERTY.,
310,OF LIBERTY.,"Pray let us but consider a little what mean, servile things men do for"
311,OF LIBERTY.,this imaginary food.  We cannot fetch a greater example of it than from
312,OF LIBERTY.,the chief men of that nation which boasted most of liberty.  To what
313,OF LIBERTY.,pitiful baseness did the noblest Romans submit themselves for the
314,OF LIBERTY.,"obtaining of a prætorship, or the consular dignity?  They put on the"
315,OF LIBERTY.,"habit of suppliants, and ran about, on foot and in dirt, through all the"
316,OF LIBERTY.,"tribes to beg voices; they flattered the poorest artisans, and carried a"
317,OF LIBERTY.,"nomenclator with them, to whisper in their ear every man’s name, lest"
318,OF LIBERTY.,"they should mistake it in their salutations; they shook the hand, and"
319,OF LIBERTY.,kissed the cheek of every popular tradesman; they stood all day at every
320,OF LIBERTY.,"market in the public places, to show and ingratiate themselves to the"
321,OF LIBERTY.,rout; they employed all their friends to solicit for them; they kept open
322,OF LIBERTY.,"tables in every street; they distributed wine, and bread, and money, even"
323,OF LIBERTY.,"to the vilest of the people.  _En Romanos_, _rerum Dorninos_!  Behold the"
324,OF LIBERTY.,masters of the world beginning from door to door.  This particular humble
325,OF LIBERTY.,"way to greatness is now out of fashion, but yet every ambitious person is"
326,OF LIBERTY.,"still in some sort a Roman candidate.  He must feast and bribe, and"
327,OF LIBERTY.,"attend and flatter, and adore many beasts, though not the beast with many"
328,OF LIBERTY.,"heads.  Catiline, who was so proud that he could not content himself with"
329,OF LIBERTY.,"a less power than Sylla’s, was yet so humble for the attaining of it, as"
330,OF LIBERTY.,"to make himself the most contemptible of all servants, to be a public"
331,OF LIBERTY.,"bawd for all the young gentlemen of Rome whose hot lusts, and courages,"
332,OF LIBERTY.,"and heads, he thought he might make use of.  And since I happen here to"
333,OF LIBERTY.,"propose Catiline for my instance, though there be thousand of examples"
334,OF LIBERTY.,"for the same thing, give me leave to transcribe the character which"
335,OF LIBERTY.,"Cicero gives of this noble slave, because it is a general description of"
336,OF LIBERTY.,"all ambitious men, and which Machiavel perhaps would say ought to be the"
337,OF LIBERTY.,"rule of their life and actions.  “This man,” says he, as most of you may"
338,OF LIBERTY.,"well remember, “had many artificial touches and strokes that looked like"
339,OF LIBERTY.,the beauty of great virtues; his intimate conversation was with the worst
340,OF LIBERTY.,"of men, and yet he seemed to be an admirer and lover of the best; he was"
341,OF LIBERTY.,"furnished with all the nets of lust and luxury, and yet wanted not the"
342,OF LIBERTY.,arms of labour and industry: neither do I believe that there was ever any
343,OF LIBERTY.,"monster in nature, composed out of so many different and disagreeing"
344,OF LIBERTY.,"parts.  Who more acceptable, sometimes, to the most honourable persons?"
345,OF LIBERTY.,"who more a favourite to the most infamous? who, sometimes, appeared a"
346,OF LIBERTY.,"braver champion? who, at other times, a bolder enemy to his country? who"
347,OF LIBERTY.,more dissolute in his pleasures? who more patient in his toils? who more
348,OF LIBERTY.,"rapacious in robbing? who more profuse in giving?  Above all things, this"
349,OF LIBERTY.,was remarkable and admirable in him.  The arts he had to acquire the good
350,OF LIBERTY.,"opinion and kindness of all sorts of men, to retain it with great"
351,OF LIBERTY.,"complaisance, to communicate all things to them, to watch and serve all"
352,OF LIBERTY.,"the occasions of their fortune, both with his money and his interest, and"
353,OF LIBERTY.,"his industry, and if need were, not by sticking at any wickedness"
354,OF LIBERTY.,"whatsoever that might be useful to them, to bend and turn about his own"
355,OF LIBERTY.,"nature and laveer with every wind, to live severely with the melancholy,"
356,OF LIBERTY.,"merrily with the pleasant, gravely with the aged, wantonly with the"
357,OF LIBERTY.,"young, desperately with the bold, and debauchedly with the luxurious."
358,OF LIBERTY.,"With this variety and multiplicity of his nature, as he had made a"
359,OF LIBERTY.,collection of friendships with all the most wicked and reckless of all
360,OF LIBERTY.,"nations, so, by the artificial simulation of some virtues, he made a"
361,OF LIBERTY.,shift to ensnare some honest and eminent persons into his familiarity;
362,OF LIBERTY.,neither could so vast a design as the destruction of this empire have
363,OF LIBERTY.,"been undertaken by him, if the immanity of so many vices had not been"
364,OF LIBERTY.,covered and disguised by the appearances of some excellent qualities.”
365,OF LIBERTY.,
366,OF LIBERTY.,"I see, methinks, the character of an Anti-Paul, who became all things to"
367,OF LIBERTY.,"all men, that he might destroy all; who only wanted the assistance of"
368,OF LIBERTY.,"fortune to have been as great as his friend Cæsar was, a little after"
369,OF LIBERTY.,him.  And the ways of Cæsar to compass the same ends—I mean till the
370,OF LIBERTY.,"civil war, which was but another manner of setting his country on"
371,OF LIBERTY.,"fire—were not unlike these, though he used afterward his unjust dominion"
372,OF LIBERTY.,"with more moderation than I think the other would have done.  Sallust,"
373,OF LIBERTY.,"therefore, who was well acquainted with them both and with many such-like"
374,OF LIBERTY.,"gentlemen of his time, says, “That it is the nature of ambition”"
375,OF LIBERTY.,"(_Ambitio multos mortales falsos fieri coegit_, _etc._) “to make men"
376,OF LIBERTY.,"liars and cheaters; to hide the truth in their breasts, and show, like"
377,OF LIBERTY.,"jugglers, another thing in their mouths; to cut all friendships and"
378,OF LIBERTY.,"enmities to the measure of their own interest, and to make a good"
379,OF LIBERTY.,countenance without the help of good will.”  And can there be freedom
380,OF LIBERTY.,with this perpetual constraint?  What is it but a kind of rack that
381,OF LIBERTY.,forces men to say what they have no mind to?  I have wondered at the
382,OF LIBERTY.,"extravagant and barbarous stratagem of Zopirus, and more at the praises"
383,OF LIBERTY.,"which I find of so deformed an action; who, though he was one of the"
384,OF LIBERTY.,"seven grandees of Persia, and the son of Megabises, who had freed before"
385,OF LIBERTY.,"his country from an ignoble servitude, slit his own nose and lips, cut"
386,OF LIBERTY.,"off his own ears, scourged and wounded his whole body, that he might,"
387,OF LIBERTY.,"under pretence of having been mangled so inhumanly by Darius, be received"
388,OF LIBERTY.,into Babylon (then besieged by the Persians) and get into the command of
389,OF LIBERTY.,"it by the recommendation of so cruel a sufferance, and their hopes of his"
390,OF LIBERTY.,endeavouring to revenge it.  It is a great pity the Babylonians suspected
391,OF LIBERTY.,"not his falsehood, that they might have cut off his hands too, and"
392,OF LIBERTY.,"whipped him back again.  But the design succeeded; he betrayed the city,"
393,OF LIBERTY.,and was made governor of it.  What brutish master ever punished his
394,OF LIBERTY.,offending slave with so little mercy as ambition did this Zopirus? and
395,OF LIBERTY.,yet how many are there in all nations who imitate him in some degree for
396,OF LIBERTY.,"a less reward; who, though they endure not so much corporal pain for a"
397,OF LIBERTY.,"small preferment, or some honour, as they call it, yet stick not to"
398,OF LIBERTY.,"commit actions, by which they are more shamefully and more lastingly"
399,OF LIBERTY.,"stigmatised?  But you may say, “Though these be the most ordinary and"
400,OF LIBERTY.,"open ways to greatness, yet there are narrow, thorny, and little-trodden"
401,OF LIBERTY.,"paths, too, through which some men find a passage by virtuous industry.”"
402,OF LIBERTY.,"I grant, sometimes they may; but then that industry must be such as"
403,OF LIBERTY.,"cannot consist with liberty, though it may with honesty."
404,OF LIBERTY.,
405,OF LIBERTY.,"Thou art careful, frugal, painful.  We commend a servant so, but not a"
406,OF LIBERTY.,friend.
407,OF LIBERTY.,
408,OF LIBERTY.,"Well, then, we must acknowledge the toil and drudgery which we are forced"
409,OF LIBERTY.,"to endure in this assent, but we are epicures and lords when once we are"
410,OF LIBERTY.,"gotten up into the high places.  This is but a short apprenticeship,"
411,OF LIBERTY.,after which we are made free of a royal company.  If we fall in love with
412,OF LIBERTY.,"any beauteous woman, we must be content that they should be our"
413,OF LIBERTY.,"mistresses whilst we woo them.  As soon as we are wedded and enjoy, ’tis"
414,OF LIBERTY.,we shall be the masters.
415,OF LIBERTY.,
416,OF LIBERTY.,I am willing to stick to this similitude in the case of greatness: we
417,OF LIBERTY.,"enter into the bonds of it, like those of matrimony; we are bewitched"
418,OF LIBERTY.,"with the outward and painted beauty, and take it for better or worse"
419,OF LIBERTY.,before we know its true nature and interior inconveniences.  “A great
420,OF LIBERTY.,"fortune,” says Seneca, “is a great servitude.”  But many are of that"
421,OF LIBERTY.,opinion which Brutus imputes (I hope untruly) even to that patron of
422,OF LIBERTY.,"liberty, his friend Cicero.  “We fear,” says he to Atticus, “death, and"
423,OF LIBERTY.,"banishment, and poverty, a great deal too much.  Cicero, I am afraid,"
424,OF LIBERTY.,"thinks these to be the worst of evils, and if he have but some persons"
425,OF LIBERTY.,"from whom he can obtain what he has a mind to, and others who will"
426,OF LIBERTY.,"flatter and worship him, seems to be well enough contented with an"
427,OF LIBERTY.,"honourable servitude, if anything, indeed, ought to be called honourable"
428,OF LIBERTY.,in so base and contumelious a condition.”  This was spoken as became the
429,OF LIBERTY.,"bravest man who was ever born in the bravest commonwealth.  But with us,"
430,OF LIBERTY.,"generally, no condition passes for servitude that is accompanied with"
431,OF LIBERTY.,"great riches, with honours, and with the service of many inferiors.  This"
432,OF LIBERTY.,is but a deception the sight through a false medium; for if a groom serve
433,OF LIBERTY.,"a gentleman in his chamber, that gentleman a lord, and that lord a"
434,OF LIBERTY.,"prince, the groom, the gentleman, and the lord are as much servants one"
435,OF LIBERTY.,as the other.  The circumstantial difference of the one getting only his
436,OF LIBERTY.,"bread and wages, the second a plentiful, and the third a superfluous"
437,OF LIBERTY.,"estate, is no more intrinsical to this matter than the difference between"
438,OF LIBERTY.,"a plain, a rich and gaudy livery.  I do not say that he who sells his"
439,OF LIBERTY.,whole time and his own will for one hundred thousand is not a wiser
440,OF LIBERTY.,merchant than he who does it for one hundred pounds; but I will swear
441,OF LIBERTY.,"they are both merchants, and that he is happier than both who can live"
442,OF LIBERTY.,contentedly without selling that estate to which he was born.  But this
443,OF LIBERTY.,"dependence upon superiors is but one chain of the lovers of power,"
444,OF LIBERTY.,_Amatorem trecentæ Pirithoum cohibent catenæ_.  Let us begin with him by
445,OF LIBERTY.,"break of day, for by that time he is besieged by two or three hundred"
446,OF LIBERTY.,"suitors, and the hall and anti-chambers (all the outworks) possessed by"
447,OF LIBERTY.,"the enemy; as soon as his chamber opens, they are ready to break into"
448,OF LIBERTY.,"that, or to corrupt the guards for entrance.  This is so essential a part"
449,OF LIBERTY.,"of greatness, that whosoever is without it looks like a fallen favourite,"
450,OF LIBERTY.,"like a person disgraced, and condemned to do what he please all the"
451,OF LIBERTY.,"morning.  There are some who, rather than want this, are contented to"
452,OF LIBERTY.,have their rooms filled up every day with murmuring and cursing
453,OF LIBERTY.,"creditors, and to charge bravely through a body of them to get to their"
454,OF LIBERTY.,"coach.  Now I would fain know which is the worst duty, that of any one"
455,OF LIBERTY.,"particular person who waits to speak with the great man, or the great"
456,OF LIBERTY.,"man’s, who waits every day to speak with all the company.  _Aliena"
457,OF LIBERTY.,negotia centum Per caput et circum saliunt latus_: A hundred businesses
458,OF LIBERTY.,of other men (many unjust and most impertinent) fly continually about his
459,OF LIBERTY.,"head and ears, and strike him in the face like dors.  Let us contemplate"
460,OF LIBERTY.,"him a little at another special scene of glory, and that is his table."
461,OF LIBERTY.,Here he seems to be the lord of all Nature.  The earth affords him her
462,OF LIBERTY.,"best metals for his dishes, her best vegetables and animals for his food;"
463,OF LIBERTY.,the air and sea supply him with their choicest birds and fishes; and a
464,OF LIBERTY.,"great many men who look like masters attend upon him; and yet, when all"
465,OF LIBERTY.,"this is done, even all this is but Table d’Hôte.  It is crowded with"
466,OF LIBERTY.,"people for whom he cares not—with many parasites, and some spies, with"
467,OF LIBERTY.,the most burdensome sort of guests—the endeavourers to be witty.
468,OF LIBERTY.,
469,OF LIBERTY.,"But everybody pays him great respect, everybody commends his meat—that"
470,OF LIBERTY.,"is, his money; everybody admires the exquisite dressing and ordering of"
471,OF LIBERTY.,"it—that is, his clerk of the kitchen, or his cook; everybody loves his"
472,OF LIBERTY.,"hospitality—that is, his vanity.  But I desire to know why the honest"
473,OF LIBERTY.,innkeeper who provides a public table for his profits should be but of a
474,OF LIBERTY.,"mean profession, and he who does it for his honour a munificent prince."
475,OF LIBERTY.,"You’ll say, because one sells and the other gives.  Nay, both sell,"
476,OF LIBERTY.,"though for different things—the one for plain money, the other for I know"
477,OF LIBERTY.,"not what jewels, whose value is in custom and in fancy.  If, then, his"
478,OF LIBERTY.,"table be made a snare (as the Scripture speaks) to his liberty, where can"
479,OF LIBERTY.,he hope for freedom? there is always and everywhere some restraint upon
480,OF LIBERTY.,"him.  He is guarded with crowds, and shackled with formalities.  The half"
481,OF LIBERTY.,"hat, the whole hat, the half smile, the whole smile, the nod, the"
482,OF LIBERTY.,"embrace, the positive parting with a little bow, the comparative at the"
483,OF LIBERTY.,"middle of the room, the superlative at the door; and if the person be"
484,OF LIBERTY.,"_Pan huper sebastos_, there’s a _Huper superlative_ ceremony then of"
485,OF LIBERTY.,"conducting him to the bottom of the stairs, or to the very gate: as if"
486,OF LIBERTY.,"there were such rules set to these Leviathans as are to the sea,"
487,OF LIBERTY.,"“Hitherto shalt thou go, and no further.”  _Perditur hæc inter misero"
488,OF LIBERTY.,Lux_.  Thus wretchedly the precious day is lost.
489,OF LIBERTY.,
490,OF LIBERTY.,"How many impertinent letters and visits must he receive, and sometimes"
491,OF LIBERTY.,answer both too as impertinently?  He never sets his foot beyond his
492,OF LIBERTY.,"threshold, unless, like a funeral, he hath a train to follow him, as if,"
493,OF LIBERTY.,"like the dead corpse, he could not stir till the bearers were all ready."
494,OF LIBERTY.,"“My life,” says Horace, speaking to one of these _magnificos_, “is a"
495,OF LIBERTY.,"great deal more easy and commodious than thine, in that I can go into the"
496,OF LIBERTY.,market and cheapen what I please without being wondered at; and take my
497,OF LIBERTY.,horse and ride as far as Tarentum without being missed.”  It is an
498,OF LIBERTY.,unpleasant constraint to be always under the sight and observation and
499,OF LIBERTY.,"censure of others; as there may be vanity in it, so, methinks, there"
500,OF LIBERTY.,should be vexation too of spirit.  And I wonder how princes can endure to
501,OF LIBERTY.,have two or three hundred men stand gazing upon them whilst they are at
502,OF LIBERTY.,"dinner, and taking notice of every bit they eat.  Nothing seems greater"
503,OF LIBERTY.,"and more lordly than the multitude of domestic servants, but, even this"
504,OF LIBERTY.,"too, if weighed seriously, is a piece of servitude; unless you will be a"
505,OF LIBERTY.,"servant to them, as many men are, the trouble and care of yours in the"
506,OF LIBERTY.,"government of them all, is much more than that of every one of them in"
507,OF LIBERTY.,their observation of you.  I take the profession of a schoolmaster to be
508,OF LIBERTY.,"one of the most useful, and which ought to be of the most honourable in a"
509,OF LIBERTY.,"commonwealth, yet certainly all his farces and tyrannical authority over"
510,OF LIBERTY.,so many boys takes away his own liberty more than theirs.
511,OF LIBERTY.,
512,OF LIBERTY.,I do but slightly touch upon all these particulars of the slavery of
513,OF LIBERTY.,"greatness; I shake but a few of their outward chains; their anger,"
514,OF LIBERTY.,"hatred, jealousy, fear, envy, grief, and all the _et cetera_ of their"
515,OF LIBERTY.,"passions, which are the secret but constant tyrants and torturers of"
516,OF LIBERTY.,"their life.  I omit here, because though they be symptoms most frequent"
517,OF LIBERTY.,"and violent in this disease, yet they are common too in some degree to"
518,OF LIBERTY.,"the epidemical disease of life itself.  But the ambitious man, though he"
519,OF LIBERTY.,"be so many ways a slave (_O toties servus_!), yet he bears it bravely and"
520,OF LIBERTY.,"heroically; he struts and looks big upon the stage, he thinks himself a"
521,OF LIBERTY.,"real prince in his masking habit, and deceives too all the foolish part"
522,OF LIBERTY.,of his spectators.  He’s a slave in _Saturnalibus_.  The covetous man is
523,OF LIBERTY.,"a downright servant, a draught horse without bells or feathers; _ad"
524,OF LIBERTY.,"metalla damnatus_, a man condemned to work in mines, which is the lowest"
525,OF LIBERTY.,"and hardest condition of servitude; and, to increase his misery, a worker"
526,OF LIBERTY.,there for he knows not whom.  He heapeth up riches and knows not who
527,OF LIBERTY.,shall enjoy them; ’tis only that he himself neither shall nor can enjoy
528,OF LIBERTY.,"them.  He is an indigent needy slave, he will hardly allow himself"
529,OF LIBERTY.,clothes and board wages; _Unciatim vix demenso de suo suum defraudans
530,OF LIBERTY.,"Genium comparsit niser_.  He defrauds not only other men, but his own"
531,OF LIBERTY.,genius.  He cheats himself for money.  But the servile and miserable
532,OF LIBERTY.,"condition of this wretch is so apparent, that I leave it, as evident to"
533,OF LIBERTY.,"every man’s sight, as well as judgment.  It seems a more difficult work"
534,OF LIBERTY.,to prove that the voluptuous man too is but a servant.  What can be more
535,OF LIBERTY.,"the life of a freeman, or, as we say ordinarily, of a gentleman, than to"
536,OF LIBERTY.,"follow nothing but his own pleasures?  Why, I’ll tell you who is that"
537,OF LIBERTY.,true freeman and that true gentleman; not he who blindly follows all his
538,OF LIBERTY.,"pleasures (the very name of follower is servile), but he who rationally"
539,OF LIBERTY.,"guides them, and is not hindered by outward impediments in the conduct"
540,OF LIBERTY.,and enjoyment of them.  If I want skill or force to restrain the beast
541,OF LIBERTY.,"that I ride upon, though I bought it, and call it my own, yet in the"
542,OF LIBERTY.,truth of the matter I am at that time rather his man than he my horse.
543,OF LIBERTY.,"The voluptuous men (whom we are fallen upon) may be divided, I think,"
544,OF LIBERTY.,"into the lustful and luxurious, who are both servants of the belly; the"
545,OF LIBERTY.,"other whom we spoke of before, the ambitious and the covetous, were κακὰ"
546,OF LIBERTY.,"θηρία, evil wild beasts; these are Γαστέρες ἀργαί, slow bellies, as our"
547,OF LIBERTY.,translation renders it; but the word Ἀργαί (which is a fantastical word
548,OF LIBERTY.,with two directly opposite significations) will bear as well the
549,OF LIBERTY.,"translation of quick or diligent bellies, and both interpretations may be"
550,OF LIBERTY.,"applied to these men.  Metrodorus said, “That he had learnt Ἀληθως γαστρὶ"
551,OF LIBERTY.,"χαρίζεσθαι, to give his belly just thanks for all his pleasures.”  This"
552,OF LIBERTY.,by the calumniators of Epicurus his philosophy was objected as one of the
553,OF LIBERTY.,"most scandalous of all their sayings, which, according to my charitable"
554,OF LIBERTY.,"understanding, may admit a very virtuous sense, which is, that he thanked"
555,OF LIBERTY.,"his own belly for that moderation in the customary appetites of it, which"
556,OF LIBERTY.,can only give a man liberty and happiness in this world.  Let this
557,OF LIBERTY.,suffice at present to be spoken of those great trinmviri of the world;
558,OF LIBERTY.,"the covetous man, who is a mean villain, like Lepidus; the ambitious, who"
559,OF LIBERTY.,"is a brave one, like Octavius; and the voluptuous, who is a loose and"
560,OF LIBERTY.,"debauched one, like Mark Antony.  _Quisnam igitur Liber_?  _Sapiens_,"
561,OF LIBERTY.,"_sibi qui Imperiosus_.  Not Oenomaus, who commits himself wholly to a"
562,OF LIBERTY.,"charioteer that may break his neck, but the man"
563,OF LIBERTY.,
564,OF LIBERTY.,"Who governs his own course with steady hand,"
565,OF LIBERTY.,Who does himself with sovereign power command;
566,OF LIBERTY.,"Whom neither death nor poverty does fright,"
567,OF LIBERTY.,Who stands not awkwardly in his own light
568,OF LIBERTY.,"Against the truth: who can, when pleasures knock"
569,OF LIBERTY.,"Loud at his door, keep firm the bolt and lock."
570,OF LIBERTY.,"Who can, though honour at his gate should stay"
571,OF LIBERTY.,"In all her masking clothes, send her away,"
572,OF LIBERTY.,"And cry, Begone, I have no mind to play."
573,OF LIBERTY.,
574,OF LIBERTY.,This I confess is a freeman; but it may be said that many persons are so
575,OF LIBERTY.,shackled by their fortune that they are hindered from enjoyment of that
576,OF LIBERTY.,"manumission which they have obtained from virtue.  I do both understand,"
577,OF LIBERTY.,and in part feel the weight of this objection.  All I can answer to it
578,OF LIBERTY.,"is, “That we must get as much liberty as we can; we must use our utmost"
579,OF LIBERTY.,"endeavours, and when all that is done, be contented with the length of"
580,OF LIBERTY.,that line which is allowed us.”  If you ask me in what condition of life
581,OF LIBERTY.,"I think the most allowed, I should pitch upon that sort of people whom"
582,OF LIBERTY.,"King James was wont to call the happiest of our nation, the men placed in"
583,OF LIBERTY.,"the country by their fortune above an high constable, and yet beneath the"
584,OF LIBERTY.,"trouble of a justice of the peace, in a moderate plenty, without any just"
585,OF LIBERTY.,"argument for the desire of increasing it by the care of many relations,"
586,OF LIBERTY.,"and with so much knowledge and love of piety and philosophy (that is, of"
587,OF LIBERTY.,the study of God’s laws and of his creatures) as may afford him matter
588,OF LIBERTY.,"enough never to be idle though without business, and never to be"
589,OF LIBERTY.,melancholy though without sin or vanity.
590,OF LIBERTY.,
591,OF LIBERTY.,I shall conclude this tedious discourse with a prayer of mine in a copy
592,OF LIBERTY.,"of Latin verses, of which I remember no other part, and (_pour faire"
593,OF LIBERTY.,bonne bouche_) with some other verses upon the same subject.
594,OF LIBERTY.,

603,OF LIBERTY.,I’ll thankfully that overplus receive.

838,OF SOLITUDE.,
839,OF SOLITUDE.,
840,OF SOLITUDE.,"“_Nunquam minus solus_, _quam cum solis_,” is now become a very vulgar"
841,OF SOLITUDE.,saying.  Every man and almost every boy for these seventeen hundred years
842,OF SOLITUDE.,has had it in his mouth.  But it was at first spoken by the excellent
843,OF SOLITUDE.,"Scipio, who was without question a most worthy, most happy, and the"
844,OF SOLITUDE.,greatest of all mankind.  His meaning no doubt was this: that he found
845,OF SOLITUDE.,"more satisfaction to his mind, and more improvement of it by solitude"
846,OF SOLITUDE.,than by company; and to show that he spoke not this loosely or out of
847,OF SOLITUDE.,"vanity, after he had made Rome mistress of almost the whole world, he"
848,OF SOLITUDE.,"retired himself from it by a voluntary exile, and at a private house in"
849,OF SOLITUDE.,the middle of a wood near Linternum passed the remainder of his glorious
850,OF SOLITUDE.,life no less gloriously.  This house Seneca went to see so long after
851,OF SOLITUDE.,"with great veneration, and, among other things, describes his bath to"
852,OF SOLITUDE.,"have been of so mean a structure, that now, says he, the basest of the"
853,OF SOLITUDE.,"people would despise them, and cry out, “Poor Scipio understood not how"
854,OF SOLITUDE.,to live.”  What an authority is here for the credit of retreat! and happy
855,OF SOLITUDE.,had it been for Hannibal if adversity could have taught him as much
856,OF SOLITUDE.,wisdom as was learnt by Scipio from the highest prosperities.  This would
857,OF SOLITUDE.,be no wonder if it were as truly as it is colourably and wittily said by
858,OF SOLITUDE.,"Monsieur de Montaigne, that ambition itself might teach us to love"
859,OF SOLITUDE.,solitude: there is nothing does so much hate to have companions.  It is
860,OF SOLITUDE.,"true, it loves to have its elbows free, it detests to have company on"
861,OF SOLITUDE.,"either side, but it delights above all things in a train behind, aye, and"
862,OF SOLITUDE.,"ushers, too, before it.  But the greater part of men are so far from the"
863,OF SOLITUDE.,"opinion of that noble Roman, that if they chance at any time to be"
864,OF SOLITUDE.,without company they are like a becalmed ship; they never move but by the
865,OF SOLITUDE.,"wind of other men’s breath, and have no oars of their own to steer"
866,OF SOLITUDE.,"withal.  It is very fantastical and contradictory in human nature, that"
867,OF SOLITUDE.,"men should love themselves above all the rest of the world, and yet never"
868,OF SOLITUDE.,"endure to be with themselves.  When they are in love with a mistress, all"
869,OF SOLITUDE.,other persons are importunate and burdensome to them.  “_Tecum vivere
870,OF SOLITUDE.,"amem_, _tecum obeam lubens_,” They would live and die with her alone."

881,OF SOLITUDE.,
882,OF SOLITUDE.,And yet our dear self is so wearisome to us that we can scarcely support
883,OF SOLITUDE.,its conversation for an hour together.  This is such an odd temper of
884,OF SOLITUDE.,"mind as Catullus expresses towards one of his mistresses, whom we may"
885,OF SOLITUDE.,suppose to have been of a very unsociable humour.

894,OF SOLITUDE.,
895,OF SOLITUDE.,"It is a deplorable condition this, and drives a man sometimes to pitiful"
896,OF SOLITUDE.,shifts in seeking how to avoid himself.
897,OF SOLITUDE.,
898,OF SOLITUDE.,"The truth of the matter is, that neither he who is a fop in the world is"
899,OF SOLITUDE.,"a fit man to be alone, nor he who has set his heart much upon the world,"
900,OF SOLITUDE.,though he has ever so much understanding; so that solitude can be well
901,OF SOLITUDE.,fitted and set right but upon a very few persons.  They must have enough
902,OF SOLITUDE.,"knowledge of the world to see the vanity of it, and enough virtue to"
903,OF SOLITUDE.,"despise all vanity; if the mind be possessed with any lust or passions, a"
904,OF SOLITUDE.,"man had better be in a fair than in a wood alone.  They may, like petty"
905,OF SOLITUDE.,"thieves, cheat us perhaps, and pick our pockets in the midst of company,"
906,OF SOLITUDE.,"but like robbers, they use to strip and bind, or murder us when they"
907,OF SOLITUDE.,"catch us alone.  This is but to retreat from men, and fall into the hands"
908,OF SOLITUDE.,"of devils.  It is like the punishment of parricides among the Romans, to"
909,OF SOLITUDE.,"be sewed into a bag with an ape, a dog, and a serpent.  The first work,"
910,OF SOLITUDE.,"therefore, that a man must do to make himself capable of the good of"
911,OF SOLITUDE.,"solitude is the very eradication of all lusts, for how is it possible for"
912,OF SOLITUDE.,a man to enjoy himself while his affections are tied to things without
913,OF SOLITUDE.,"himself?  In the second place, he must learn the art and get the habit of"
914,OF SOLITUDE.,"thinking; for this too, no less than well speaking, depends upon much"
915,OF SOLITUDE.,practice; and cogitation is the thing which distinguishes the solitude of
916,OF SOLITUDE.,a god from a wild beast.  Now because the soul of man is not by its own
917,OF SOLITUDE.,nature or observation furnished with sufficient materials to work upon;
918,OF SOLITUDE.,it is necessary for it to have continual resource to learning and books
919,OF SOLITUDE.,"for fresh supplies, so that the solitary life will grow indigent, and be"
920,OF SOLITUDE.,ready to starve without them; but if once we be thoroughly engaged in the
921,OF SOLITUDE.,"love of letters, instead of being wearied with the length of any day, we"
922,OF SOLITUDE.,shall only complain of the shortness of our whole life.

931,OF SOLITUDE.,"one nation, the other all the works of God and nature under his"
932,OF SOLITUDE.,consideration.  There is no saying shocks me so much as that which I hear
933,OF SOLITUDE.,"very often, “That a man does not know how to pass his time.”  It would"
934,OF SOLITUDE.,have been but ill spoken by Methusalem in the nine hundred and
935,OF SOLITUDE.,"sixty-ninth year of his life, so far it is from us, who have not time"
936,OF SOLITUDE.,"enough to attain to the utmost perfection of any part of any science, to"
937,OF SOLITUDE.,have cause to complain that we are forced to be idle for want of work.
938,OF SOLITUDE.,"But this you will say is work only for the learned, others are not"
939,OF SOLITUDE.,capable either of the employments or the divertisements that arise from
940,OF SOLITUDE.,"letters.  I know they are not, and therefore cannot much recommend"
941,OF SOLITUDE.,solitude to a man totally illiterate.  But if any man be so unlearned as
942,OF SOLITUDE.,"to want entertainment of the little intervals of accidental solitude,"
943,OF SOLITUDE.,which frequently occur in almost all conditions (except the very meanest
944,OF SOLITUDE.,"of the people, who have business enough in the necessary provisions for"
945,OF SOLITUDE.,"life), it is truly a great shame both to his parents and himself; for a"
946,OF SOLITUDE.,very small portion of any ingenious art will stop up all those gaps of
947,OF SOLITUDE.,"our time, either music, or painting, or designing, or chemistry, or"
948,OF SOLITUDE.,"history, or gardening, or twenty other things, will do it usefully and"
949,OF SOLITUDE.,pleasantly; and if he happen to set his affections upon poetry (which I
950,OF SOLITUDE.,do not advise him too immoderately) that will overdo it; no wood will be
951,OF SOLITUDE.,"thick enough to hide him from the importunities of company or business,"

1092,OF OBSCURITY.,"vixit_, He has lived well, who has lain well hidden.  Which, if it be a"
1093,OF OBSCURITY.,"truth, the world, I’ll swear, is sufficiently deceived.  For my part, I"
1094,OF OBSCURITY.,"think it is, and that the pleasantest condition of life, is in"
1095,OF OBSCURITY.,_incognito_.  What a brave privilege is it to be free from all
1096,OF OBSCURITY.,"contentions, from all envying or being envied, from receiving and from"
1097,OF OBSCURITY.,paying all kind of ceremonies?  It is in my mind a very delightful
1098,OF OBSCURITY.,"pastime, for two good and agreeable friends to travel up and down"
1099,OF OBSCURITY.,"together in places where they are by nobody known, nor know anybody.  It"
1100,OF OBSCURITY.,"was the case of Æneas and his Achates, when they walked invisibly about"
1101,OF OBSCURITY.,"the fields and streets of Carthage, Venus herself"
1102,OF OBSCURITY.,
1103,OF OBSCURITY.,"A veil of thickened air around them cast,"
1104,OF OBSCURITY.,"That none might know, or see them as they passed."
1105,OF OBSCURITY.,
1106,OF OBSCURITY.,The common story of Demosthenes’s confession that he had taken great
1107,OF OBSCURITY.,"pleasure in hearing of a Tanker-woman say as he passed, “This is that"
1108,OF OBSCURITY.,"Demosthenes,” is wonderful ridiculous from so solid an orator.  I myself"
1109,OF OBSCURITY.,"have often met with that temptation to vanity (if it were any), but am so"
1110,OF OBSCURITY.,"far from finding it any pleasure, that it only makes me run faster from"
1111,OF OBSCURITY.,"the place, till I get, as it were, out of sight shot.  Democritus"
1112,OF OBSCURITY.,"relates, and in such a manner, as if he gloried in the good fortune and"
1113,OF OBSCURITY.,"commodity of it, that when he came to Athens, nobody there did so much as"
1114,OF OBSCURITY.,"take notice of him; and Epicurus lived there very well, that is, lay hid"
1115,OF OBSCURITY.,"many years in his gardens, so famous since that time, with his friend"
1116,OF OBSCURITY.,"Metrodorus: after whose death, making in one of his letters a kind"
1117,OF OBSCURITY.,"commemoration of the happiness which they two had enjoyed together, he"
1118,OF OBSCURITY.,"adds at last, that he thought it no disparagement to those great"
1119,OF OBSCURITY.,"felicities of their life, that in the midst of the most talked of and"
1120,OF OBSCURITY.,"talking country in the world, they had lived so long, not only without"
1121,OF OBSCURITY.,"fame, but almost without being heard of.  And yet within a very few years"
1122,OF OBSCURITY.,"afterward, there were no two names of men more known or more generally"
1123,OF OBSCURITY.,celebrated.  If we engage into a large acquaintance and various
1124,OF OBSCURITY.,"familiarities, we set open our gates to the invaders of most of our time:"
1125,OF OBSCURITY.,"we expose our life to a Quotidian Ague of frigid impertinences, which"
1126,OF OBSCURITY.,"would make a wise man tremble to think of.  Now, as for being known much"
1127,OF OBSCURITY.,"by sight, and pointed at, I cannot comprehend the honour that lies in"
1128,OF OBSCURITY.,"that.  Whatsoever it be, every mountebank has it more than the best"
1129,OF OBSCURITY.,"doctor, and the hangman more than the Lord Chief Justice of a city."
1130,OF OBSCURITY.,Every creature has it both of nature and art if it be any ways
1131,OF OBSCURITY.,"extraordinary.  It was as often said, “This is that Bucephalus,” or,"
1132,OF OBSCURITY.,"“This is that Incitatus,” when they were led prancing through the"
1133,OF OBSCURITY.,"streets, as “This is that Alexander,” or, “This is that Domitian”; and"
1134,OF OBSCURITY.,"truly for the latter, I take Incitatus to have been a much more"
1135,OF OBSCURITY.,"honourable beast than his master, and more deserving the consulship than"
1136,OF OBSCURITY.,"he the empire.  I love and commend a true good fame, because it is the"
1137,OF OBSCURITY.,shadow of virtue; not that it doth any good to the body which it
1138,OF OBSCURITY.,"accompanies, but ’tis an efficacious shadow, and like that of St. Peter"
1139,OF OBSCURITY.,"cures the diseases of others.  The best kind of glory, no doubt, is that"
1140,OF OBSCURITY.,"which is reflected from honesty, such as was the glory of Cato and"
1141,OF OBSCURITY.,"Aristides, but it was harmful to them both, and is seldom beneficial to"
1142,OF OBSCURITY.,"any man whilst he lives; what it is to him after his death, I cannot say,"
1143,OF OBSCURITY.,"because I love not philosophy merely notional and conjectural, and no man"
1144,OF OBSCURITY.,who has made the experiment has been so kind as to come back to inform
1145,OF OBSCURITY.,"us.  Upon the whole matter, I account a person who has a moderate mind"
1146,OF OBSCURITY.,"and fortune, and lives in the conversation of two or three agreeable"
1147,OF OBSCURITY.,"friends, with little commerce in the world besides; who is esteemed well"
1148,OF OBSCURITY.,"enough by his few neighbours that know him, and is truly irreproachable"
1149,OF OBSCURITY.,"by anybody; and so after a healthful quiet life, before the great"
1150,OF OBSCURITY.,"inconveniences of old age, goes more silently out of it than he came in"
1151,OF OBSCURITY.,(for I would not have him so much as cry in the exit); this innocent
1152,OF OBSCURITY.,"deceiver of the word, as Horace calls him, this Muta Persona, I take to"
1153,OF OBSCURITY.,"have been more happy in his part, than the greatest actors that fill the"
1154,OF OBSCURITY.,"stage with show and noise, nay, even than Augustus himself, who asked"
1155,OF OBSCURITY.,"with his last breath, whether he had not played his farce very well."

1195,OF AGRICULTURE.,"THE first wish of Virgil (as you will find anon by his verses), was to be"
1196,OF AGRICULTURE.,"a good philosopher; the second, a good husbandman; and God (whom he"
1197,OF AGRICULTURE.,seemed to understand better than most of the most learned heathens) dealt
1198,OF AGRICULTURE.,with him just as he did with Solomon: because he prayed for wisdom in the
1199,OF AGRICULTURE.,"first place, he added all things else which were subordinately to be"
1200,OF AGRICULTURE.,"desired.  He made him one of the best philosophers, and best husbandmen,"
1201,OF AGRICULTURE.,"and to adorn and communicate both those faculties, the best poet.  He"
1202,OF AGRICULTURE.,"made him, besides all this, a rich man, and a man who desired to be no"
1203,OF AGRICULTURE.,"richer, _O fortunatas nimium et bona qui sua novit_.  To be a husbandman,"
1204,OF AGRICULTURE.,"is but a retreat from the city; to be a philosopher, from the world; or"
1205,OF AGRICULTURE.,"rather, a retreat from the world, as it is Man’s—into the world, as it is"
1206,OF AGRICULTURE.,"God’s.  But since Nature denies to most men the capacity or appetite, and"
1207,OF AGRICULTURE.,"Fortune allows but to a very few the opportunities or possibility, of"
1208,OF AGRICULTURE.,"applying themselves wholly to philosophy, the best mixture of human"
1209,OF AGRICULTURE.,"affairs that we can make are the employments of a country life.  It is,"
1210,OF AGRICULTURE.,"as Columella calls it, _Res sine dubitatione proxima et quasi"
1211,OF AGRICULTURE.,"consanguinea sapientiæ_, the nearest neighbour, or rather next in kindred"
1212,OF AGRICULTURE.,to Philosophy.  Varro says the principles of it are the same which Ennius
1213,OF AGRICULTURE.,"made to be the principles of all nature; earth, water, air, and the sun."
1214,OF AGRICULTURE.,It does certainly comprehend more parts of philosophy than any one
1215,OF AGRICULTURE.,"profession, art, or science in the world besides; and, therefore, Cicero"
1216,OF AGRICULTURE.,"says, the pleasures of a husbandman, _Mihi ad sapientis vitam proxime"
1217,OF AGRICULTURE.,"videntur accedere_, come very nigh to those of a philosopher.  There is"
1218,OF AGRICULTURE.,no other sort of life that affords so many branches of praise to a
1219,OF AGRICULTURE.,"panegyrist: The utility of it to a man’s self; the usefulness, or,"
1220,OF AGRICULTURE.,"rather, necessity of it to all the rest of mankind; the innocence, the"
1221,OF AGRICULTURE.,"pleasure, the antiquity, the dignity.  The utility (I mean plainly the"
1222,OF AGRICULTURE.,lucre of it) is not so great now in our nation as arises from merchandise
1223,OF AGRICULTURE.,"and the trading of the city, from whence many of the best estates and"
1224,OF AGRICULTURE.,chief honours of the kingdom are derived; we have no men now fetched from
1225,OF AGRICULTURE.,"the plough to be made lords, as they were in Rome to be made consuls and"
1226,OF AGRICULTURE.,"dictators, the reason of which I conceive to be from an evil custom now"
1227,OF AGRICULTURE.,"grown as strong among us as if it were a law, which is, that no men put"
1228,OF AGRICULTURE.,"their children to be bred up apprentices in agriculture, as in other"
1229,OF AGRICULTURE.,"trades, but such who are so poor, that when they come to be men they have"
1230,OF AGRICULTURE.,"not wherewithal to set up in it, and so can only farm some small parcel"
1231,OF AGRICULTURE.,"of ground, the rent of which devours all but the bare subsistence of the"
1232,OF AGRICULTURE.,tenant; whilst they who are proprietors of the land are either too proud
1233,OF AGRICULTURE.,"or, for want of that kind of education, too ignorant to improve their"
1234,OF AGRICULTURE.,"estates, though the means of doing it be as easy and certain in this as"
1235,OF AGRICULTURE.,in any other track of commerce.  If there were always two or three
1236,OF AGRICULTURE.,"thousand youths, for seven or eight years bound to this profession, that"
1237,OF AGRICULTURE.,"they might learn the whole art of it, and afterwards be enabled to be"
1238,OF AGRICULTURE.,"masters in it, by a moderate stock, I cannot doubt but that we should see"
1239,OF AGRICULTURE.,as many aldermen’s estates made in the country as now we do out of all
1240,OF AGRICULTURE.,kind of merchandising in the city.  There are as many ways to be rich;
1241,OF AGRICULTURE.,"and, which is better, there is no possibility to be poor, without such"
1242,OF AGRICULTURE.,"negligence as can neither have excuse nor pity; for a little ground will,"
1243,OF AGRICULTURE.,"without question, feed a little family, and the superfluities of life"
1244,OF AGRICULTURE.,(which are now in some cases by custom made almost necessary) must be
1245,OF AGRICULTURE.,"supplied out of the superabundance of art and industry, or contemned by"
1246,OF AGRICULTURE.,"as great a degree of philosophy.  As for the necessity of this art, it is"
1247,OF AGRICULTURE.,"evident enough, since this can live without all others, and no one other"
1248,OF AGRICULTURE.,"without this.  This is like speech, without which the society of men"
1249,OF AGRICULTURE.,cannot be preserved; the others like figures and tropes of speech which
1250,OF AGRICULTURE.,"serve only to adorn it.  Many nations have lived, and some do still,"
1251,OF AGRICULTURE.,"without any art but this; not so elegantly, I confess, but still they"
1252,OF AGRICULTURE.,have; and almost all the other arts which are here practised are
1253,OF AGRICULTURE.,beholding to them for most of their materials.  The innocence of this
1254,OF AGRICULTURE.,"life is in the next thing for which I commend it, and if husbandmen"
1255,OF AGRICULTURE.,"preserve not that, they are much to blame, for no men are so free from"
1256,OF AGRICULTURE.,the temptations of iniquity.  They live by what they can get by industry
1257,OF AGRICULTURE.,"from the earth, and others by what they can catch by craft from men."
1258,OF AGRICULTURE.,"They live upon an estate given them by their mother, and others upon an"
1259,OF AGRICULTURE.,"estate cheated from their brethren.  They live like sheep and kine, by"
1260,OF AGRICULTURE.,"the allowances of Nature, and others like wolves and foxes by the"
1261,OF AGRICULTURE.,"acquisitions of rapine; and, I hope, I may affirm (without any offence to"
1262,OF AGRICULTURE.,"the great) that sheep and kine are very useful, and that wolves and foxes"
1263,OF AGRICULTURE.,"are pernicious creatures.  They are, without dispute, of all men the most"
1264,OF AGRICULTURE.,quiet and least apt to be inflamed to the disturbance of the
1265,OF AGRICULTURE.,"commonwealth; their manner of life inclines them, and interest binds"
1266,OF AGRICULTURE.,"them, to love peace.  In our late mad and miserable civil wars, all other"
1267,OF AGRICULTURE.,"trades, even to the meanest, set forth whole troops, and raised up some"
1268,OF AGRICULTURE.,"great commanders, who became famous and mighty for the mischiefs they had"
1269,OF AGRICULTURE.,done.  But I do not remember the name of any one husbandman who had so
1270,OF AGRICULTURE.,"considerable a share in the twenty years’ ruin of his country, as to"
1271,OF AGRICULTURE.,deserve the curses of his countrymen; and if great delights be joined
1272,OF AGRICULTURE.,"with so much innocence, I think it is ill done of men not to take them"
1273,OF AGRICULTURE.,"here where they are so tame and ready at hand, rather than hunt for them"
1274,OF AGRICULTURE.,"in courts and cities, where they are so wild and the chase so troublesome"
1275,OF AGRICULTURE.,and dangerous.
1276,OF AGRICULTURE.,
1277,OF AGRICULTURE.,We are here among the vast and noble scenes of Nature; we are there among
1278,OF AGRICULTURE.,the pitiful shifts of policy.  We walk here in the light and open ways of
1279,OF AGRICULTURE.,the divine bounty; we grope there in the dark and confused labyrinths of
1280,OF AGRICULTURE.,human malice.  Our senses are here feasted with the clear and genuine
1281,OF AGRICULTURE.,"taste of their objects, which are all sophisticated there, and for the"
1282,OF AGRICULTURE.,"most part overwhelmed with their contraries.  Here Pleasure looks,"
1283,OF AGRICULTURE.,"methinks, like a beautiful, constant, and modest wife; it is there an"
1284,OF AGRICULTURE.,"impudent, fickle, and painted harlot.  Here is harmless and cheap plenty,"
1285,OF AGRICULTURE.,there guilty and expenseful luxury.
1286,OF AGRICULTURE.,
1287,OF AGRICULTURE.,"I shall only instance in one delight more, the most natural and best"
1288,OF AGRICULTURE.,"natured of all others, a perpetual companion of the husbandman: and that"
1289,OF AGRICULTURE.,"is, the satisfaction of looking round about him, and seeing nothing but"
1290,OF AGRICULTURE.,the effects and improvements of his own art and diligence; to be always
1291,OF AGRICULTURE.,"gathering of some fruits of it, and at the same time to behold others"
1292,OF AGRICULTURE.,"ripening, and others budding; to see all his fields and gardens covered"
1293,OF AGRICULTURE.,"with the beauteous creatures of his own industry; and to see, like God,"
1294,OF AGRICULTURE.,that all his works are good.
1295,OF AGRICULTURE.,
1296,OF AGRICULTURE.,_Hinc atque hinc glomerantur Oreades_; _ipsi_
1297,OF AGRICULTURE.,_Agricolæ tacitum pertentant gaudia pectus_.
1298,OF AGRICULTURE.,
1299,OF AGRICULTURE.,On his heart-strings a secret joy does strike.
1300,OF AGRICULTURE.,
1301,OF AGRICULTURE.,The antiquity of his art is certainly not to be contested by any other.
1302,OF AGRICULTURE.,"The three first men in the world were a gardener, a ploughman, and a"
1303,OF AGRICULTURE.,"grazier; and if any man object that the second of these was a murderer, I"
1304,OF AGRICULTURE.,"desire he would consider, that as soon as he was so, he quitted our"
1305,OF AGRICULTURE.,"profession and turned builder.  It is for this reason, I suppose, that"
1306,OF AGRICULTURE.,"Ecclesiasticus forbids us to hate husbandry; because, says he, the Most"
1307,OF AGRICULTURE.,"High has created it.  We were all born to this art, and taught by nature"
1308,OF AGRICULTURE.,"to nourish our bodies by the same earth out of which they were made, and"
1309,OF AGRICULTURE.,to which they must return and pay at last for their sustenance.
1310,OF AGRICULTURE.,
1311,OF AGRICULTURE.,Behold the original and primitive nobility of all those great persons who
1312,OF AGRICULTURE.,"are too proud now not only to till the ground, but almost to tread upon"
1313,OF AGRICULTURE.,"it.  We may talk what we please of lilies and lions rampant, and spread"
1314,OF AGRICULTURE.,"eagles in fields d’or or d’argent; but if heraldry were guided by reason,"
1315,OF AGRICULTURE.,a plough in a field arable would be the most noble and ancient arms.
1316,OF AGRICULTURE.,
1317,OF AGRICULTURE.,All these considerations make me fall into the wonder and complaint of
1318,OF AGRICULTURE.,"Columella, how it should come to pass that all arts or Sciences (for the"
1319,OF AGRICULTURE.,"dispute, which is an art and which is a science, does not belong to the"
1320,OF AGRICULTURE.,"curiosity of us husbandmen), metaphysic, physic, morality, mathematics,"
1321,OF AGRICULTURE.,"logic, rhetoric, etc., which are all, I grant, good and useful faculties,"
1322,OF AGRICULTURE.,"except only metaphysic, which I do not know whether it be anything or no,"
1323,OF AGRICULTURE.,"but even vaulting, fencing, dancing, attiring, cookery, carving, and such"
1324,OF AGRICULTURE.,"like vanities, should all have public schools and masters; and yet that"
1325,OF AGRICULTURE.,we should never see or hear of any man who took upon him the profession
1326,OF AGRICULTURE.,"of teaching this so pleasant, so virtuous, so profitable, so honourable,"
1327,OF AGRICULTURE.,so necessary art.
1328,OF AGRICULTURE.,
1329,OF AGRICULTURE.,"A man would think, when he’s in serious humour, that it were but a vain,"
1330,OF AGRICULTURE.,"irrational, and ridiculous thing for a great company of men and women to"
1331,OF AGRICULTURE.,"run up and down in a room together, in a hundred several postures and"
1332,OF AGRICULTURE.,"figures, to no purpose, and with no design; and therefore dancing was"
1333,OF AGRICULTURE.,"invented first, and only practised anciently, in the ceremonies of the"
1334,OF AGRICULTURE.,"heathen religion, which consisted all in mummery and madness; the latter"
1335,OF AGRICULTURE.,"being the chief glory of the worship, and accounted divine inspiration."
1336,OF AGRICULTURE.,"This, I say, a severe man would think, though I dare not determine so far"
1337,OF AGRICULTURE.,"against so customary a part now of good breeding.  And yet, who is there"
1338,OF AGRICULTURE.,among our gentry that does not entertain a dancing master for his
1339,OF AGRICULTURE.,children as soon as they are able to walk?  But did ever any father
1340,OF AGRICULTURE.,provide a tutor for his son to instruct him betimes in the nature and
1341,OF AGRICULTURE.,improvements of that land which he intended to leave him?  That is at
1342,OF AGRICULTURE.,"least a superfluity, and this a defect in our manner of education; and"
1343,OF AGRICULTURE.,"therefore I could wish, but cannot in these times much hope to see it,"
1344,OF AGRICULTURE.,"that one college in each university were erected, and appropriated to"
1345,OF AGRICULTURE.,"this study, as well as there are to medicine and the civil law.  There"
1346,OF AGRICULTURE.,"would be no need of making a body of scholars and fellows, with certain"
1347,OF AGRICULTURE.,"endowments, as in other colleges; it would suffice if, after the manner"
1348,OF AGRICULTURE.,"of Halls in Oxford, there were only four professors constituted (for it"
1349,OF AGRICULTURE.,"would be too much work for only one master, or Principal, as they call"
1350,OF AGRICULTURE.,"him there) to teach these four parts of it.  First, aration, and all"
1351,OF AGRICULTURE.,"things relating to it.  Secondly, pasturage; thirdly, gardens, orchards,"
1352,OF AGRICULTURE.,"vineyards, and woods; fourthly, all parts of rural economy, which would"
1353,OF AGRICULTURE.,"contain the government of bees, swine, poultry, decoys, ponds, etc., and"
1354,OF AGRICULTURE.,"all that which Varro calls Villaticas Pastiones, together with the sports"
1355,OF AGRICULTURE.,"of the field, which ought not to be looked upon only as pleasures, but as"
1356,OF AGRICULTURE.,"parts of housekeeping, and the domestical conservation and uses of all"
1357,OF AGRICULTURE.,that is brought in by industry abroad.  The business of these professors
1358,OF AGRICULTURE.,"should not be, as is commonly practised in other arts, only to read"
1359,OF AGRICULTURE.,"pompous and superficial lectures out of Virgil’s Georgics, Pliny, Varro,"
1360,OF AGRICULTURE.,"or Columella, but to instruct their pupils in the whole method and course"
1361,OF AGRICULTURE.,"of this study, which might be run through perhaps with diligence in a"
1362,OF AGRICULTURE.,year or two; and the continual succession of scholars upon a moderate
1363,OF AGRICULTURE.,"taxation for their diet, lodging, and learning, would be a sufficient"
1364,OF AGRICULTURE.,"constant revenue for maintenance of the house and the professors, who"
1365,OF AGRICULTURE.,"should be men not chosen for the ostentation of critical literature, but"
1366,OF AGRICULTURE.,for solid and experimental knowledge of the things they teach such men;
1367,OF AGRICULTURE.,"so industrious and public spirited as I conceive Mr. Hartlib to be, if"
1368,OF AGRICULTURE.,the gentleman be yet alive.  But it is needless to speak further of my
1369,OF AGRICULTURE.,"thoughts of this design, unless the present disposition of the age"
1370,OF AGRICULTURE.,allowed more probability of bringing it into execution.  What I have
1371,OF AGRICULTURE.,"further to say of the country life shall be borrowed from the poets, who"
1372,OF AGRICULTURE.,were always the most faithful and affectionate friends to it.  Poetry was
1373,OF AGRICULTURE.,born among the shepherds.
1374,OF AGRICULTURE.,
1375,OF AGRICULTURE.,_Nescio qua natale solum dulcedine musas_
1376,OF AGRICULTURE.,"_Ducit_, _et immemores non sinit esse sui_."
1377,OF AGRICULTURE.,
1378,OF AGRICULTURE.,"The Muses still love their own native place,"
1379,OF AGRICULTURE.,’T has secret charms which nothing can deface.
1380,OF AGRICULTURE.,
1381,OF AGRICULTURE.,"The truth is, no other place is proper for their work.  One might as well"
1382,OF AGRICULTURE.,"undertake to dance in a crowd, as to make good verses in the midst of"
1383,OF AGRICULTURE.,noise and tumult.
1384,OF AGRICULTURE.,
1385,OF AGRICULTURE.,As well might corn as verse in cities grow;
1386,OF AGRICULTURE.,"In vain the thankless glebe we plough and sow,"
1387,OF AGRICULTURE.,"Against th’ unnatural soil in vain we strive,"
1388,OF AGRICULTURE.,’Tis not a ground in which these plants will thrive.
1389,OF AGRICULTURE.,
1390,OF AGRICULTURE.,"It will bear nothing but the nettles or thorns of satire, which grow most"
1391,OF AGRICULTURE.,"naturally in the worst earth; and therefore almost all poets, except"
1392,OF AGRICULTURE.,"those who were not able to eat bread without the bounty of great men,"
1393,OF AGRICULTURE.,"that is, without what they could get by flattering of them, have not only"
1394,OF AGRICULTURE.,withdrawn themselves from the vices and vanities of the grand world
1395,OF AGRICULTURE.,(_pariter vitiisque jocisque altius humanis exeruere caput_) into the
1396,OF AGRICULTURE.,innocent happiness of a retired life; but have commended and adorned
1397,OF AGRICULTURE.,nothing so much by their ever-living poems.  Hesiod was the first or
1398,OF AGRICULTURE.,"second poet in the world that remains yet extant (if Homer, as some"
1399,OF AGRICULTURE.,"think, preceded him, but I rather believe they were contemporaries), and"
1400,OF AGRICULTURE.,"he is the first writer, too, of the art of husbandry.  He has"
1401,OF AGRICULTURE.,"contributed, says Columella, not a little to our profession; I suppose he"
1402,OF AGRICULTURE.,"means not a little honour, for the matter of his instructions is not very"
1403,OF AGRICULTURE.,important.  His great antiquity is visible through the gravity and
1404,OF AGRICULTURE.,simplicity of his style.  The most acute of all his sayings concerns our
1405,OF AGRICULTURE.,"purpose very much, and is couched in the reverend obscurity of an oracle."
1406,OF AGRICULTURE.,Πλέν ἥμισυ παντός.  The half is more than the whole.  The occasion of the
1407,OF AGRICULTURE.,speech is this: his brother Perses had by corrupting some great men
1408,OF AGRICULTURE.,"(Βασιλῆας Δωροφάγους, great bribe-eaters he calls them) gotten from him"
1409,OF AGRICULTURE.,"the half of his estate.  It is no matter, says he, they have not done me"
1410,OF AGRICULTURE.,so much prejudice as they imagine.
1411,OF AGRICULTURE.,
1412,OF AGRICULTURE.,"Νήπιοι, οὐδ’ ἴσασιν ὅσῳ πλέον ᾕμισυ παντὸς"
1413,OF AGRICULTURE.,"Οὐδ’ ὅσον ἐν μαλάχη τε καὶ ἀσφοδέλῳ μεγ’ ὔνειας,"
1414,OF AGRICULTURE.,Κρύψαντες γὰρ ἔχουσι θεοὶ Βίον ἀνθρώποισι.

1416,OF AGRICULTURE.,Unhappy they to whom God has not revealed
1417,OF AGRICULTURE.,"By a strong light which must their sense control,"
1418,OF AGRICULTURE.,That half a great estate’s more than the whole.
1419,OF AGRICULTURE.,"Unhappy, from whom still concealed does lie"
1420,OF AGRICULTURE.,Of roots and herbs the wholesome luxury.
1421,OF AGRICULTURE.,
1422,OF AGRICULTURE.,This I conceive to have been honest Hesiod’s meaning.  From Homer we must
1423,OF AGRICULTURE.,"not expect much concerning our affairs.  He was blind, and could neither"
1424,OF AGRICULTURE.,work in the country nor enjoy the pleasures of it; his helpless poverty
1425,OF AGRICULTURE.,"was likeliest to be sustained in the richest places, he was to delight"
1426,OF AGRICULTURE.,the Grecians with fine tales of the wars and adventures of their
1427,OF AGRICULTURE.,"ancestors; his subject removed him from all commerce with us, and yet,"
1428,OF AGRICULTURE.,"methinks, he made a shift to show his goodwill a little.  For though he"
1429,OF AGRICULTURE.,could do us no honour in the person of his hero Ulysses (much less of
1430,OF AGRICULTURE.,"Achilles), because his whole time was consumed in wars and voyages, yet"
1431,OF AGRICULTURE.,"he makes his father Laertes a gardener all that while, and seeking his"
1432,OF AGRICULTURE.,consolation for the absence of his son in the pleasure of planting and
1433,OF AGRICULTURE.,"even dunging his own grounds.  Yet, see, he did not contemn us peasants;"
1434,OF AGRICULTURE.,"nay, so far was he from that insolence, that he always styles Eumæus, who"
1435,OF AGRICULTURE.,"kept the hogs with wonderful respect, Δῖον ὔφυρβυν, the divine"
1436,OF AGRICULTURE.,swine-herd; he could have done no more for Menelaus or Agamemnon.  And
1437,OF AGRICULTURE.,"Theocritus (a very ancient poet, but he was one of our own tribe, for he"
1438,OF AGRICULTURE.,wrote nothing but pastorals) gave the same epithet to a husbandman
1439,OF AGRICULTURE.,"Εμέιβετο Δῖος ἀγρώτης.  The divine husbandman replied to Hercules, who"
1440,OF AGRICULTURE.,"was but Δῖος himself.  These were civil Greeks, and who understood the"
1441,OF AGRICULTURE.,"dignity of our calling.  Among the Romans, we have in the first place our"
1442,OF AGRICULTURE.,"truly divine Virgil, who, though by the favour of Mæcenas and Augustus he"
1443,OF AGRICULTURE.,"might have been one of the chief men of Rome, yet chose rather to employ"
1444,OF AGRICULTURE.,"much of his time in the exercise, and much of his immortal wit in the"
1445,OF AGRICULTURE.,"praise and instructions of a rustic life; who, though he had written"
1446,OF AGRICULTURE.,"before whole books of Pastorals and Georgics, could not abstain in his"
1447,OF AGRICULTURE.,"great and imperial poem from describing Evander, one of his best princes,"
1448,OF AGRICULTURE.,as living just after the homely manner of an ordinary countryman.  He
1449,OF AGRICULTURE.,"seats him in a throne of maple, and lays him but upon a bear’s skin, the"
1450,OF AGRICULTURE.,"kine and oxen are lowing in his courtyard, the birds’ under the eaves of"
1451,OF AGRICULTURE.,his window call him up in the morning; and when he goes abroad only two
1452,OF AGRICULTURE.,"dogs go along, with him for his guard.  At last, when he brings Æneas"
1453,OF AGRICULTURE.,"into his royal cottage, he makes him say this memorable compliment,"
1454,OF AGRICULTURE.,"greater than ever yet was spoken at the Escurial, the Louvre, or our"
1455,OF AGRICULTURE.,Whitehall.
1456,OF AGRICULTURE.,
1457,OF AGRICULTURE.,"_Hæc_, _inquit_, _limina victor_"
1458,OF AGRICULTURE.,"_Alcides subiit_, _hæc illum Regia cepit_,"
1459,OF AGRICULTURE.,"_Aude_, _Hospes_, _contemnere opes_, _et te quoque dignum_"
1460,OF AGRICULTURE.,"_Finge Deo_, _rebusque veni non asper egenis_."
1461,OF AGRICULTURE.,
1462,OF AGRICULTURE.,"This humble roof, this rustic court, said he,"
1463,OF AGRICULTURE.,Received Alcides crowned with victory.
1464,OF AGRICULTURE.,"Scorn not, great guest, the steps where he has trod,"
1465,OF AGRICULTURE.,"But contemn wealth, and imitate a god."
1466,OF AGRICULTURE.,
1467,OF AGRICULTURE.,"The next man whom we are much obliged to, both for his doctrine and"
1468,OF AGRICULTURE.,"example, is the next best poet in the world to Virgil: his dear friend"
1469,OF AGRICULTURE.,"Horace, who, when Augustus had desired Mecænas to persuade him to come"
1470,OF AGRICULTURE.,"and live domestically and at the same table with him, and to be Secretary"
1471,OF AGRICULTURE.,"of State of the whole world under him, or rather jointly with him (for he"
1472,OF AGRICULTURE.,"says, “_ut nos in Epistolis scribendis adjuvet_,”) could not be tempted"
1473,OF AGRICULTURE.,"to forsake his Sabine or Tiburtine Manor, for so rich and so glorious a"
1474,OF AGRICULTURE.,"trouble.  There was never, I think, such an example as this in the world,"
1475,OF AGRICULTURE.,that he should have so much moderation and courage as to refuse an offer
1476,OF AGRICULTURE.,"of such greatness, and the Emperor so much generosity and good nature as"
1477,OF AGRICULTURE.,"not to be at all offended with his refusal, but to retain still the same"
1478,OF AGRICULTURE.,"kindness, and express it often to him in most friendly and familiar"
1479,OF AGRICULTURE.,"letters, part of which are still extant.  If I should produce all the"
1480,OF AGRICULTURE.,passages of this excellent author upon the several subjects which I treat
1481,OF AGRICULTURE.,"of in this book, I must be obliged to translate half his works; of which"
1482,OF AGRICULTURE.,"I may say more truly than, in my opinion, he did of Homer, “_Qui quid sit"
1483,OF AGRICULTURE.,"pulchrum_, _quid turpe_, _quid utile_, _quid non_, _plenius_, _et melius"
1484,OF AGRICULTURE.,"Chrysippo_, _et Crantore dicit_.”  I shall content myself upon this"
1485,OF AGRICULTURE.,"particular theme with three only, one out of his Odes, the other out of"
1486,OF AGRICULTURE.,"his Satires, the third out of his Epistles, and shall forbear to collect"
1487,OF AGRICULTURE.,"the suffrages of all other poets, which may be found scattered up and"
1488,OF AGRICULTURE.,"down through all their writings, and especially in Martial’s.  But I must"
1489,OF AGRICULTURE.,not omit to make some excuse for the bold undertaking of my own unskilful
1490,OF AGRICULTURE.,pencil upon the beauties of a face that has been drawn before by so many
1491,OF AGRICULTURE.,"great masters, especially that I should dare to do it in Latin verses"
1492,OF AGRICULTURE.,(though of another kind) and have the confidence to translate them.  I
1493,OF AGRICULTURE.,"can only say that I love the matter, and that ought to cover, many"
1494,OF AGRICULTURE.,"faults; and that I run not to contend with those before me, but follow to"
1495,OF AGRICULTURE.,applaud them.

2280,OF GREATNESS.,"SINCE we cannot attain to greatness, says the Sieur de Montaigne, let us"
2281,OF GREATNESS.,have our revenge by railing at it; this he spoke but in jest.  I believe
2282,OF GREATNESS.,"he desired it no more than I do, and had less reason, for he enjoyed so"
2283,OF GREATNESS.,"plentiful and honourable a fortune in a most excellent country, as"
2284,OF GREATNESS.,"allowed him all the real conveniences of it, separated and purged from"
2285,OF GREATNESS.,"the incommodities.  If I were but in his condition, I should think it"
2286,OF GREATNESS.,"hard measure, without being convinced of any crime, to be sequestered"
2287,OF GREATNESS.,from it and made one of the principal officers of state.  But the reader
2288,OF GREATNESS.,"may think that what I now say is of small authority, because I never was,"
2289,OF GREATNESS.,"nor ever shall be, put to the trial; I can therefore only make my"
2290,OF GREATNESS.,protestation.
2291,OF GREATNESS.,
2292,OF GREATNESS.,If ever I more riches did desire
2293,OF GREATNESS.,Than cleanliness and quiet do require;
2294,OF GREATNESS.,"If e’er ambition did my fancy cheat,"
2295,OF GREATNESS.,"With any wish so mean as to be great,"
2296,OF GREATNESS.,"Continue, Heaven, still from me to remove"
2297,OF GREATNESS.,The humble blessings of that life I love.
2298,OF GREATNESS.,
2299,OF GREATNESS.,"I know very many men will despise, and some pity me, for this humour, as"
2300,OF GREATNESS.,"a poor-spirited fellow; but I am content, and, like Horace, thank God for"
2301,OF GREATNESS.,"being so.  _Dii bene fecerunt inopis me_, _quodque pusilli finxerunt"
2302,OF GREATNESS.,animi_.  I confess I love littleness almost in all things.  A little
2303,OF GREATNESS.,"convenient estate, a little cheerful house, a little company, and a very"
2304,OF GREATNESS.,little feast; and if I were ever to fall in love again (which is a great
2305,OF GREATNESS.,"passion, and therefore I hope I have done with it) it would be, I think,"
2306,OF GREATNESS.,with prettiness rather than with majestical beauty.  I would neither wish
2307,OF GREATNESS.,"that my mistress, nor my fortune, should be a bona roba, nor, as Homer"
2308,OF GREATNESS.,"used to describe his beauties, like a daughter of great Jupiter, for the"
2309,OF GREATNESS.,"stateliness and largeness of her person, but, as Lucretius says,"
2310,OF GREATNESS.,"“_Parvula_, _pumilio_, Χαρίτων μία, _tota merum sal_.”"
2311,OF GREATNESS.,
2312,OF GREATNESS.,"Where there is one man of this, I believe there are a thousand of"
2313,OF GREATNESS.,"Senecio’s mind, whose ridiculous affectation of grandeur Seneca the elder"
2314,OF GREATNESS.,describes to this effect.  Senecio was a man of a turbid and confused
2315,OF GREATNESS.,"wit, who could not endure to speak any but mighty words and sentences,"
2316,OF GREATNESS.,"till this humour grew at last into so notorious a habit, or rather"
2317,OF GREATNESS.,"disease, as became the sport of the whole town: he would have no servants"
2318,OF GREATNESS.,"but huge massy fellows, no plate or household stuff but thrice as big as"
2319,OF GREATNESS.,"the fashion; you may believe me, for I speak it without raillery, his"
2320,OF GREATNESS.,extravagancy came at last into such a madness that he would not put on a
2321,OF GREATNESS.,pair of shoes each of which was not big enough for both his feet; he
2322,OF GREATNESS.,"would eat nothing but what was great, nor touch any fruit but horse-plums"
2323,OF GREATNESS.,"and pound-pears.  He kept a concubine that was a very giantess, and made"
2324,OF GREATNESS.,"her walk, too, always in a chiopins, till at last he got the surname of"
2325,OF GREATNESS.,"Senecio Grandio, which, Messala said, was not his cognomen, but his"
2326,OF GREATNESS.,"cognomentum.  When he declaimed for the three hundred Lacedæmonians, who"
2327,OF GREATNESS.,"also opposed Xerxes’ army of above three hundred thousand, he stretched"
2328,OF GREATNESS.,"out his arms and stood on tiptoes, that he might appear the taller, and"
2329,OF GREATNESS.,"cried out in a very loud voice, “I rejoice, I rejoice!”  We wondered, I"
2330,OF GREATNESS.,"remember, what new great fortune had befallen his eminence.  “Xerxes,”"
2331,OF GREATNESS.,"says he, “is all mine own.  He who took away the sight of the sea with"
2332,OF GREATNESS.,"the canvas veils of so many ships . . . ” and then he goes on so, as I"
2333,OF GREATNESS.,"know not what to make of the rest, whether it be the fault of the"
2334,OF GREATNESS.,"edition, or the orator’s own burly way of nonsense."
2335,OF GREATNESS.,
2336,OF GREATNESS.,"This is the character that Seneca gives of this hyperbolical fop, whom we"
2337,OF GREATNESS.,"stand amazed at, and yet there are very few men who are not, in some"
2338,OF GREATNESS.,"things, and to some degree, grandios.  Is anything more common than to"
2339,OF GREATNESS.,see our ladies of quality wear such high shoes as they cannot walk in
2340,OF GREATNESS.,"without one to lead them? and a gown as long again as their body, so that"
2341,OF GREATNESS.,they cannot stir to the next room without a page or two to hold it up?  I
2342,OF GREATNESS.,may safely say that all the ostentation of our grandees is just like a
2343,OF GREATNESS.,"train, of no use in the world, but horribly cumbersome and incommodious."
2344,OF GREATNESS.,What is all this but spice of _grandio_?  How tedious would this be if we
2345,OF GREATNESS.,were always bound to it?  I do believe there is no king who would not
2346,OF GREATNESS.,rather be deposed than endure every day of his reign all the ceremonies
2347,OF GREATNESS.,of his coronation.  The mightiest princes are glad to fly often from
2348,OF GREATNESS.,"these majestic pleasures (which is, methinks, no small disparagement to"
2349,OF GREATNESS.,"them), as it were for refuge, to the most contemptible divertisements and"
2350,OF GREATNESS.,"meanest recreations of the vulgar, nay, even of children.  One of the"
2351,OF GREATNESS.,"most powerful and fortunate princes of the world of late, could find out"
2352,OF GREATNESS.,"no delight so satisfactory as the keeping of little singing birds, and"
2353,OF GREATNESS.,hearing of them and whistling to them.  What did the emperors of the
2354,OF GREATNESS.,whole world?  If ever any men had the free and full enjoyment of all
2355,OF GREATNESS.,"human greatness (nay, that would not suffice, for they would be gods too)"
2356,OF GREATNESS.,"they certainly possessed it; and yet one of them, who styled himself"
2357,OF GREATNESS.,"“Lord and God of the Earth,” could not tell how to pass his whole day"
2358,OF GREATNESS.,"pleasantly, without spending constant two or three hours in catching of"
2359,OF GREATNESS.,"flies, and killing them with a bodkin, as if his godship had been"
2360,OF GREATNESS.,"Beelzebub.  One of his predecessors, Nero (who never put any bounds, nor"
2361,OF GREATNESS.,"met with any stop to his appetite), could divert himself with no pastime"
2362,OF GREATNESS.,"more agreeable than to run about the streets all night in a disguise, and"
2363,OF GREATNESS.,"abuse the women and affront the men whom he met, and sometimes to beat"
2364,OF GREATNESS.,"them, and sometimes to be beaten by them.  This was one of his imperial"
2365,OF GREATNESS.,nocturnal pleasures; his chiefest in the day was to sing and play upon a
2366,OF GREATNESS.,"fiddle, in the habit of a minstrel, upon the public stage; he was prouder"
2367,OF GREATNESS.,of the garlands that were given to his divine voice (as they called it
2368,OF GREATNESS.,"then) in those kind of prizes, than all his forefathers were of their"
2369,OF GREATNESS.,triumphs over nations.  He did not at his death complain that so mighty
2370,OF GREATNESS.,"an emperor, and the last of all the Cæsarian race of deities, should be"
2371,OF GREATNESS.,"brought to so shameful and miserable an end, but only cried out, “Alas!"
2372,OF GREATNESS.,what pity it is that so excellent a musician should perish in this
2373,OF GREATNESS.,manner!”  His uncle Claudius spent half his time at playing at dice; that
2374,OF GREATNESS.,was the main fruit of his sovereignty.  I omit the madnesses of
2375,OF GREATNESS.,"Caligula’s delights, and the execrable sordidness of those of Tiberius."
2376,OF GREATNESS.,"Would one think that Augustus himself, the highest and most fortunate of"
2377,OF GREATNESS.,"mankind, a person endowed too with many excellent parts of nature, should"
2378,OF GREATNESS.,"be so hard put to it sometimes for want of recreations, as to be found"
2379,OF GREATNESS.,"playing at nuts and bounding-stones with little Syrian and Moorish boys,"
2380,OF GREATNESS.,"whose company he took delight in, for their prating and their wantonness?"
2381,OF GREATNESS.,
2382,OF GREATNESS.,"Was it for this, that Rome’s best blood he spilt,"
2383,OF GREATNESS.,"With so much falsehood, so much guilt?"
2384,OF GREATNESS.,Was it for this that his ambition strove
2385,OF GREATNESS.,"To equal Cæsar first, and after Jove?"
2386,OF GREATNESS.,Greatness is barren sure of solid joys;
2387,OF GREATNESS.,"Her merchandise, I fear, is all in toys;"
2388,OF GREATNESS.,"She could not else sure so uncivil be,"
2389,OF GREATNESS.,"To treat his universal majesty,"
2390,OF GREATNESS.,"His new created Deity,"
2391,OF GREATNESS.,With nuts and bounding-stones and boys.
2392,OF GREATNESS.,
2393,OF GREATNESS.,But we must excuse her for this meagre entertainment; she has not really
2394,OF GREATNESS.,wherewithal to make such feasts as we imagine; her guests must be
2395,OF GREATNESS.,"contented sometimes with but slender cates, and with the same cold meats"
2396,OF GREATNESS.,"served over and over again, even till they become nauseous.  When you"
2397,OF GREATNESS.,"have pared away all the vanity, what solid and natural contentment does"
2398,OF GREATNESS.,there remain which may not be had with five hundred pounds a year? not so
2399,OF GREATNESS.,"many servants or horses, but a few good ones, which will do all the"
2400,OF GREATNESS.,business as well; not so many choice dishes at every meal; but at several
2401,OF GREATNESS.,"meals all of them, which makes them both the more healthy and dine more"
2402,OF GREATNESS.,"pleasant; not so rich garments nor so frequent changes, but as warm and"
2403,OF GREATNESS.,"as comely, and so frequent change, too, as is every jot as good for the"
2404,OF GREATNESS.,"master, though not for the tailor or valet-de-chambre; not such a stately"
2405,OF GREATNESS.,"palace, nor gilt rooms, nor the costlier sorts of tapestry, but a"
2406,OF GREATNESS.,"convenient brick house, with decent wainscot and pretty forest-work"
2407,OF GREATNESS.,"hangings.  Lastly (for I omit all other particulars, and will end with"
2408,OF GREATNESS.,"that which I love most in both conditions), not whole woods cut in walks,"
2409,OF GREATNESS.,"nor vast parks, nor fountain or cascade gardens, but herb and flower and"
2410,OF GREATNESS.,"fruit gardens, which are more useful, and the water every whit as clear"
2411,OF GREATNESS.,and wholesome as if it darted from the breasts of a marble nymph or the
2412,OF GREATNESS.,urn of a river-god.  If for all this you like better the substance of
2413,OF GREATNESS.,"that former estate of life, do but consider the inseparable accidents of"
2414,OF GREATNESS.,"both: servitude, disquiet, danger, and most commonly guilt, inherent in"
2415,OF GREATNESS.,"the one; in the other, liberty, tranquillity, security, and innocence:"
2416,OF GREATNESS.,"and when you have thought upon this, you will confess that to be a truth"
2417,OF GREATNESS.,"which appeared to you before but a ridiculous paradox, that a low fortune"
2418,OF GREATNESS.,"is better guarded and attended than a high one.  If indeed, we look only"
2419,OF GREATNESS.,"upon the flourishing head of the tree, it appears a most beautiful"
2420,OF GREATNESS.,object.
2421,OF GREATNESS.,
2422,OF GREATNESS.,—_Sed quantum vertice ad auras_
2423,OF GREATNESS.,"_Ætherias_, _tantum radice ad Tartara tendit_."

2425,OF GREATNESS.,"As far up towards heaven the branches grow,"
2426,OF GREATNESS.,So far the root sinks down to hell below.
2427,OF GREATNESS.,
2428,OF GREATNESS.,"Another horrible disgrace to greatness is, that it is for the most part"
2429,OF GREATNESS.,"in pitiful want and distress.  What a wonderful thing is this, unless it"
2430,OF GREATNESS.,"degenerate into avarice, and so cease to be greatness.  It falls"
2431,OF GREATNESS.,perpetually into such necessities as drive it into all the meanest and
2432,OF GREATNESS.,"most sordid ways of borrowing, cozenage, and robbery, _Mancipiis"
2433,OF GREATNESS.,"locopules_, _eget aris Cappadocum Rex_.  This is the case of almost all"
2434,OF GREATNESS.,"great men, as well as of the poor King of Cappadocia.  They abound with"
2435,OF GREATNESS.,"slaves, but are indigent of money.  The ancient Roman emperors, who had"
2436,OF GREATNESS.,"the riches of the whole world for their revenue, had wherewithal to live,"
2437,OF GREATNESS.,"one would have thought, pretty well at ease, and to have been exempt from"
2438,OF GREATNESS.,the pressures of extreme poverty.  But yet with most of them it was much
2439,OF GREATNESS.,"otherwise, and they fell perpetually into such miserable penury, that"
2440,OF GREATNESS.,"they were forced to devour or squeeze most of their friends and servants,"
2441,OF GREATNESS.,"to cheat with infamous projects, to ransack and pillage all their"
2442,OF GREATNESS.,provinces.  This fashion of imperial grandeur is imitated by all inferior
2443,OF GREATNESS.,"and subordinate sorts of it, as if it were a point of honour.  They must"
2444,OF GREATNESS.,"be cheated of a third part of their estates, two other thirds they must"
2445,OF GREATNESS.,"expend in vanity, so that they remain debtors for all the necessary"
2446,OF GREATNESS.,"provisions of life, and have no way to satisfy those debts but out of the"
2447,OF GREATNESS.,"succours and supplies of rapine; “as riches increase,” says Solomon, “so"
2448,OF GREATNESS.,do the mouths that devour it.”  The master mouth has no more than before;
2449,OF GREATNESS.,"the owner, methinks, is like Genus in the fable, who is perpetually"
2450,OF GREATNESS.,winding a rope of hay and an ass at the end perpetually eating it.  Out
2451,OF GREATNESS.,"of these inconveniences arises naturally one more, which is, that no"
2452,OF GREATNESS.,"greatness can be satisfied or contented with itself: still, if it could"
2453,OF GREATNESS.,"mount up a little higher, it would be happy; if it could but gain that"
2454,OF GREATNESS.,"point, it would obtain all its desires; but yet at last, when it is got"
2455,OF GREATNESS.,"up to the very top of the peak of Teneriffe, it is in very great danger"
2456,OF GREATNESS.,"of breaking its neck downwards, but in no possibility of ascending"
2457,OF GREATNESS.,upwards into the seat of tranquillity above the moon.  The first
2458,OF GREATNESS.,"ambitious men in the world, the old giants, are said to have made an"
2459,OF GREATNESS.,"heroical attempt of scaling Heaven in despite of the gods, and they cast"
2460,OF GREATNESS.,"Ossa upon Olympus and Pelion upon Ossa, two or three mountains more they"
2461,OF GREATNESS.,"thought would have done their business, but the thunder spoiled all the"

2463,OF GREATNESS.,
2464,OF GREATNESS.,"And what a noble plot was crossed,"
2465,OF GREATNESS.,And what a brave design was lost.
2466,OF GREATNESS.,
2467,OF GREATNESS.,"A famous person of their offspring, the late giant of our nation, when,"
2468,OF GREATNESS.,"from the condition of a very inconsiderable captain, he had made himself"
2469,OF GREATNESS.,"lieutenant-general of an army of little Titans, which was his first"
2470,OF GREATNESS.,"mountain; and afterwards general, which was his second; and after that"
2471,OF GREATNESS.,"absolute tyrant of three kingdoms, which was the third, and almost"
2472,OF GREATNESS.,touched the heaven which he affected; is believed to have died with grief
2473,OF GREATNESS.,"and discontent because he could not attain to the honest name of a king,"
2474,OF GREATNESS.,"and the old formality of a crown, though he had before exceeded the power"
2475,OF GREATNESS.,"by a wicked usurpation.  If he could have compassed that, he would"
2476,OF GREATNESS.,"perhaps have wanted something else that is necessary to felicity, and"
2477,OF GREATNESS.,pined away for the want of the title of an emperor or a god.  The reason
2478,OF GREATNESS.,"of this is, that greatness has no reality in nature, but is a creature of"
2479,OF GREATNESS.,the fancy—a notion that consists only in relation and comparison.  It is
2480,OF GREATNESS.,indeed an idol; but St. Paul teaches us that an idol is nothing in the
2481,OF GREATNESS.,"world.  There is in truth no rising or meridian of the sun, but only in"
2482,OF GREATNESS.,"respect to several places: there is no right or left, no upper hand in"
2483,OF GREATNESS.,nature; everything is little and everything is great according as it is
2484,OF GREATNESS.,diversely compared.  There may be perhaps some villages in Scotland or
2485,OF GREATNESS.,Ireland where I might be a great man; and in that case I should be like
2486,OF GREATNESS.,Cæsar—you would wonder how Cæsar and I should be like one another in
2487,OF GREATNESS.,anything—and choose rather to be the first man of the village than second
2488,OF GREATNESS.,"at Rome.  Our Country is called Great Britain, in regard only of a lesser"
2489,OF GREATNESS.,of the same name; it would be but a ridiculous epithet for it when we
2490,OF GREATNESS.,"consider it together with the kingdom of China.  That, too, is but a"
2491,OF GREATNESS.,pitiful rood of ground in comparison of the whole earth besides; and this
2492,OF GREATNESS.,"whole globe of earth, which we account so immense a body, is but one"
2493,OF GREATNESS.,point or atom in relation to those numberless worlds that are scattered
2494,OF GREATNESS.,up and down in the infinite space of the sky which we behold.  The other
2495,OF GREATNESS.,many inconveniences of grandeur I have spoken of dispersedly in several
2496,OF GREATNESS.,"chapters, and shall end this with an ode of Horace, not exactly copied"
2497,OF GREATNESS.,but rudely imitated.

2588,OF AVARICE.,OF AVARICE.
2589,OF AVARICE.,
2590,OF AVARICE.,
2591,OF AVARICE.,THERE are two sorts of avarice; the one is but of a bastard kind; and
2592,OF AVARICE.,"that is, the rapacious appetite of gain, not for its own sake, but for"
2593,OF AVARICE.,the pleasure of refunding it immediately through all the channels of
2594,OF AVARICE.,"pride and luxury.  The other is the true kind, and properly so called;"
2595,OF AVARICE.,"which is a restless and unsatiable desire of riches, not for any further"
2596,OF AVARICE.,"end of use, but only to hoard, and preserve, and perpetually increase"
2597,OF AVARICE.,"them.  The covetous man of the first kind is like a greedy ostrich, which"
2598,OF AVARICE.,"devours any metal, but it is with an intent to feed upon it, and in"
2599,OF AVARICE.,effect it makes a shift to digest and excern it.  The second is like the
2600,OF AVARICE.,"foolish chough, which loves to steal money only to hide it.  The first"
2601,OF AVARICE.,"does much harm to mankind, and a little good too, to some few.  The"
2602,OF AVARICE.,"second does good to none; no, not to himself.  The first can make no"
2603,OF AVARICE.,"excuse to God, or angels, or rational men for his actions.  The second"
2604,OF AVARICE.,"can give no reason or colour, not to the devil himself, for what he does:"
2605,OF AVARICE.,he is a slave to Mammon without wages.  The first makes a shift to be
2606,OF AVARICE.,"beloved; aye, and envied, too, by some people.  The second is the"
2607,OF AVARICE.,universal object of hatred and contempt.  There is no vice has been so
2608,OF AVARICE.,"pelted with good sentences, and especially by the poets, who have pursued"
2609,OF AVARICE.,"it with stories and fables, and allegories and allusions; and moved, as"
2610,OF AVARICE.,"we say, every stone to fling at it, among all which, I do not remember a"
2611,OF AVARICE.,more fine and gentlemen-like correction than that which was given it by
2612,OF AVARICE.,one line of Ovid’s.
2613,OF AVARICE.,
2614,OF AVARICE.,"_Desunt luxuriæ malta_, _avaritiæ omnia_."
2615,OF AVARICE.,
2616,OF AVARICE.,Much is wanting to luxury; all to avarice
2617,OF AVARICE.,
2618,OF AVARICE.,To which saying I have a mind to add one member and render it thus:—
2619,OF AVARICE.,
2620,OF AVARICE.,"Poverty wants some, luxury many, avarice all things."
2621,OF AVARICE.,
2622,OF AVARICE.,"Somebody says of a virtuous and wise man, that having nothing, he has"
2623,OF AVARICE.,"all.  This is just his antipode, who, having all things, yet has nothing."
2624,OF AVARICE.,He is a guardian eunuch to his beloved gold: _Audivi eos amatores esse
2625,OF AVARICE.,"maximos sed nil potesse_.  They are the fondest lovers, but impotent to"
2626,OF AVARICE.,enjoy.
2627,OF AVARICE.,
2628,OF AVARICE.,"And, oh, what man’s condition can be worse"
2629,OF AVARICE.,"Than his, whom plenty starves, and blessings curse?"
2630,OF AVARICE.,"The beggars but a common fate deplore,"
2631,OF AVARICE.,The rich poor man’s emphatically poor.
2632,OF AVARICE.,
2633,OF AVARICE.,I wonder how it comes to pass that there has never been any law made
2634,OF AVARICE.,"against him.  Against him, do I say?  I mean for him, as there is a"
2635,OF AVARICE.,public provision made for all other madmen.  It is very reasonable that
2636,OF AVARICE.,the king should appoint some persons (and I think the courtiers would not
2637,OF AVARICE.,be against this proposition) to manage his estate during his life (for
2638,OF AVARICE.,"his heirs commonly need not that care), and out of it to make it their"
2639,OF AVARICE.,"business to see that he should not want alimony befitting his condition,"
2640,OF AVARICE.,which he could never get out of his own cruel fingers.  We relieve idle
2641,OF AVARICE.,"vagrants and counterfeit beggars, but have no care at all of these really"
2642,OF AVARICE.,"poor men, who are, methinks, to be respectfully treated in regard of"
2643,OF AVARICE.,"their quality.  I might be endless against them, but I am almost choked"
2644,OF AVARICE.,with the superabundance of the matter.  Too much plenty impoverishes me
2645,OF AVARICE.,as it does them.  I will conclude this odious subject with part of
2646,OF AVARICE.,"Horace’s first Satire, which take in his own familiar style:—"
2647,OF AVARICE.,
2648,OF AVARICE.,"I admire, Mæcenas, how it comes to pass,"
2649,OF AVARICE.,"That no man ever yet contented was,"
2650,OF AVARICE.,"Nor is, nor perhaps will be, with that state"
2651,OF AVARICE.,"In which his own choice plants him, or his fate."
2652,OF AVARICE.,Happy the merchant! the old soldier cries.
2653,OF AVARICE.,"The merchant, beaten with tempestuous skies"
2654,OF AVARICE.,Happy the soldier! one half-hour to thee
2655,OF AVARICE.,Gives speedy death or glorious victory.
2656,OF AVARICE.,"The lawyer, knocked up early from his rest"
2657,OF AVARICE.,"By restless clients, calls the peasant blest."
2658,OF AVARICE.,"The peasant, when his labours ill succeed,"
2659,OF AVARICE.,Envies the mouth which only talk does feed.
2660,OF AVARICE.,"’Tis not, I think you’ll say, that I want store"
2661,OF AVARICE.,"Of instances, if here I add no more,"
2662,OF AVARICE.,They are enough to reach at least a mile
2663,OF AVARICE.,Beyond long Orator Fabius his style.
2664,OF AVARICE.,"But hold, you whom no fortune e’er endears,"
2665,OF AVARICE.,"Gentlemen, malcontents, and mutineers,"
2666,OF AVARICE.,"Who bounteous Jove so often cruel call,"
2667,OF AVARICE.,"Behold, Jove’s now resolved to please you all."
2668,OF AVARICE.,"Thou, soldier, be a merchant; merchant, thou"
2669,OF AVARICE.,A soldier be; and lawyer to the plough.
2670,OF AVARICE.,Change all your stations straight.  Why do they stay?
2671,OF AVARICE.,The devil a man will change now when he may.
2672,OF AVARICE.,"Were I in General Jove’s abusèd case,"
2673,OF AVARICE.,"By Jove, I’d cudgel this rebellious race;"
2674,OF AVARICE.,"But he’s too good; be all, then, as you were;"
2675,OF AVARICE.,"However, make the best of what you are,"
2676,OF AVARICE.,"And in that state be cheerful and rejoice,"
2677,OF AVARICE.,Which either was your fate or was your choice.
2678,OF AVARICE.,"No; they must labour yet, and sweat and toil,"
2679,OF AVARICE.,And very miserable be awhile.
2680,OF AVARICE.,But ’tis with a design only to gain
2681,OF AVARICE.,What may their age with plenteous ease maintain;
2682,OF AVARICE.,"The prudent pismire does this lesson teach,"
2683,OF AVARICE.,And industry to lazy mankind preach.
2684,OF AVARICE.,"The little drudge does trot about and sweat,"
2685,OF AVARICE.,"Nor does he straight devour all he can get,"

2687,OF AVARICE.,A stock for winter which he knows must come.
2688,OF AVARICE.,And when the rolling world to creatures here
2689,OF AVARICE.,"Turns up the deformed wrong side of the year,"
2690,OF AVARICE.,"And shuts him in with storms and cold and wet,"
2691,OF AVARICE.,He cheerfully does his past labours eat.
2692,OF AVARICE.,"Oh, does he so? your wise example, the ant"
2693,OF AVARICE.,"Does not at all times rest, and plenty want."
2694,OF AVARICE.,"But, weighing justly a mortal ant’s condition,"
2695,OF AVARICE.,Divides his life ’twixt labour and fruition.
2696,OF AVARICE.,"Thee neither heat, nor storms, nor wet, nor cold"
2697,OF AVARICE.,"From thy unnatural diligence can withhold,"
2698,OF AVARICE.,To the Indies thou wouldst run rather than see
2699,OF AVARICE.,"Another, though a friend, richer than thee."
2700,OF AVARICE.,Fond man! what good or beauty can be found
2701,OF AVARICE.,In heaps of treasure buried under ground?
2702,OF AVARICE.,"Which, rather than diminished e’er to see,"
2703,OF AVARICE.,"Thou wouldst thyself, too, buried with them be"

2705,OF AVARICE.,"Never to use, as never to have had?"
2706,OF AVARICE.,"In thy vast barns millions of quarters store,"
2707,OF AVARICE.,"Thy belly, for all that, will hold no more"
2708,OF AVARICE.,"Than mine does.  Every baker makes much bread,"

2710,OF AVARICE.,"Do you within the bounds of Nature live,"
2711,OF AVARICE.,And to augment your own you need not strive;
2712,OF AVARICE.,One hundred acres will no less for you
2713,OF AVARICE.,Your life’s whole business than ten thousand do.
2714,OF AVARICE.,But pleasant ’tis to take from a great store;
2715,OF AVARICE.,"What, man? though you’re resolved to take no more"
2716,OF AVARICE.,Than I do from a small one; if your will
2717,OF AVARICE.,"Be but a pitcher or a pot to fill,"

2721,OF AVARICE.,"Safe, easy, and untroubled stores produce;"
2722,OF AVARICE.,"He who scorns these, and needs will drink at Nile,"
2723,OF AVARICE.,Must run the danger of the crocodile;
2724,OF AVARICE.,"And of the rapid stream itself which may,"
2725,OF AVARICE.,At unawares bear him perhaps away.
2726,OF AVARICE.,"In a full flood Tantalus stands, his skin"
2727,OF AVARICE.,"Washed o’er in vain, for ever dry within;"
2728,OF AVARICE.,"He catches at the stream with greedy lips,"
2729,OF AVARICE.,From his touched mouth the wanton torment slips.
2730,OF AVARICE.,"You laugh now, and expand your careful brow:"

2736,OF AVARICE.,"The treasures of the gods thou wouldst not spare,"

2845,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,IF twenty thousand naked Americans were not able to resist the assaults

2849,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"the offensive, too, of craft and malice.  He will find no less odds than"
2850,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,this against him if he have much to do in human affairs.  The only
2851,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"advice, therefore, which I can give him is, to be sure not to venture his"
2852,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"person any longer in the open campaign, to retreat and entrench himself,"
2853,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"to stop up all avenues, and draw up all bridges against so numerous an"
2854,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"enemy.  The truth of it is, that a man in much business must either make"
2855,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"himself a knave, or else the world will make him a fool: and if the"
2856,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"injury went no farther than the being laughed at, a wise man would"
2857,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,content himself with the revenge of retaliation: but the case is much
2858,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"worse, for these civil cannibals too, as well as the wild ones, not only"
2859,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"dance about such a taken stranger, but at last devour him.  A sober man"
2860,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,cannot get too soon out of drunken company; though they be never so kind
2861,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"and merry among themselves, it is not unpleasant only, but dangerous to"
2862,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,him.  Do ye wonder that a virtuous man should love to be alone?  It is
2863,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"hard for him to be otherwise; he is so, when he is among ten thousand;"
2864,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,neither is the solitude so uncomfortable to be alone without any other
2865,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"creature, as it is to be alone in the midst of wild beasts.  Man is to"
2866,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"man all kind of beasts—a fawning dog, a roaring lion, a thieving fox, a"
2867,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"robbing wolf, a dissembling crocodile, a treacherous decoy, and a"
2868,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"rapacious vulture.  The civilest, methinks, of all nations, are those"
2869,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,whom we account the most barbarous; there is some moderation and good
2870,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"nature in the Toupinambaltians who eat no men but their enemies, whilst"
2871,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"we learned and polite and Christian Europeans, like so many pikes and"
2872,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"sharks, prey upon everything that we can swallow.  It is the great boast"
2873,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"of eloquence and philosophy, that they first congregated men dispersed,"
2874,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"united them into societies, and built up the houses and the walls of"
2875,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,cities.  I wish they could unravel all they had woven; that we might have
2876,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,our woods and our innocence again instead of our castles and our
2877,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,policies.  They have assembled many thousands of scattered people into
2878,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"one body: it is true, they have done so, they have brought them together"
2879,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"into cities to cozen, and into armies to murder one another; they found"
2880,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"them hunters and fishers of wild creatures, they have made them hunters"
2881,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,and fishers of their brethren; they boast to have reduced them to a state
2882,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"of peace, when the truth is they have only taught them an art of war;"
2883,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"they have framed, I must confess, wholesome laws for the restraint of"
2884,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"vice, but they raised first that devil which now they conjure and cannot"
2885,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"bind; though there were before no punishments for wickedness, yet there"
2886,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,was less committed because there were no rewards for it.  But the men who
2887,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,praise philosophy from this topic are much deceived; let oratory answer
2888,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"for itself, the tinkling, perhaps, of that may unite a swarm: it never"
2889,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"was the work of philosophy to assemble multitudes, but to regulate only,"
2890,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"and govern them when they were assembled, to make the best of an evil,"
2891,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"and bring them, as much as is possible, to unity again.  Avarice and"
2892,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"ambition only were the first builders of towns, and founders of empire;"
2893,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"they said, “Go to, let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach"
2894,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"unto heaven, and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon"
2895,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"the face of the earth.”  What was the beginning of Rome, the metropolis"
2896,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"of all the world? what was it but a concourse of thieves, and a sanctuary"
2897,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,of criminals? it was justly named by the augury of no less than twelve
2898,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"vultures, and the founder cemented his walls with the blood of his"

2900,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,
2901,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"Not unlike to this was the beginning even of the first town, too, in the"
2902,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"world, and such is the original sin of most cities: their actual increase"
2903,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"daily with their age and growth; the more people, the more wicked all of"
2904,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"them.  Every one brings in his part to inflame the contagion, which"
2905,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"becomes at last so universal and so strong, that no precepts can be"
2906,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"sufficient preservatives, nor anything secure our safety, but flight from"
2907,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"among the infected.  We ought, in the choice of a situation, to regard"
2908,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"above all things the healthfulness of the place, and the healthfulness of"
2909,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,it for the mind rather than for the body.  But suppose (which is hardly
2910,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"to be supposed) we had antidote enough against this poison; nay, suppose,"
2911,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"further, we were always and at all places armed and provided both against"
2912,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"the assaults of hostility and the mines of treachery, it will yet be but"
2913,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,an uncomfortable life to be ever in alarms; though we were compassed
2914,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"round with fire to defend ourselves from wild beasts, the lodging would"
2915,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"be unpleasant, because we must always be obliged to watch that fire, and"
2916,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,to fear no less the defects of our guard than the diligences of our
2917,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"enemy.  The sum of this is, that a virtuous man is in danger to be trod"
2918,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"upon and destroyed in the crowd of his contraries; nay, which is worse,"
2919,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"to be changed and corrupted by them, and that it is impossible to escape"
2920,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,both these inconveniences without so much caution as will take away the
2921,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"whole quiet, that is, the happiness of his life.  Ye see, then, what he"
2922,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"may lose; but, I pray, what can he get there?  _Quid Romæ faciam_?"
2923,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,_Mentiri nescio_.  What should a man of truth and honesty do at Rome? he
2924,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"can neither understand, nor speak the language of the place; a naked man"
2925,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"may swim in the sea, but it is not the way to catch fish there; they are"
2926,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"likelier to devour him than he them, if he bring no nets and use no"

2929,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,
2930,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"Honest and poor, faithful in word and thought;"

2938,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"But you’re a man of learning, prudent, just:"

2951,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,he took no great pleasure in that kind of mirth.  I have been drawn twice

2984,THE DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.,"to confess the truth, I perceived quickly, by infallible demonstrations,"

3077,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"never consider an end of them, it is no wonder if our cares for them be"
3078,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"without end too.  Horace advises very wisely, and in excellent good"
3079,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"words, _spatio brevi spem longam reseces_; from a short life cut off all"
3080,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,hopes that grow too long.  They must be pruned away like suckers that
3081,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"choke the mother-plant, and hinder it from bearing fruit.  And in another"
3082,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"place to the same sense, _Vitæ summa brevis spem nos vetat inchoare"
3083,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"longam_, which Seneca does not mend when he says, _Oh quanta dementia est"
3084,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,spes longas inchoantium_! but he gives an example there of an
3085,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"acquaintance of his named Senecio, who from a very mean beginning by"
3086,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"great industry in turning about of money through all ways of gain, had"
3087,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"attained to extraordinary riches, but died on a sudden after having"
3088,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"supped merrily, _In ipso actu bené cedentium rerum_, _in ipso"
3089,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"procurrentis fortunæ impetu_; in the full course of his good fortune,"
3090,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,when she had a high tide and a stiff gale and all her sails on; upon
3091,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"which occasion he cries, out of Virgil:"

3098,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,
3099,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"For this Senecio I have no compassion, because he was taken, as we say,"
3100,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"in _ipso facto_, still labouring in the work of avarice; but the poor"
3101,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"rich man in St. Luke (whose case was not like this) I could pity,"
3102,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"methinks, if the Scripture would permit me, for he seems to have been"
3103,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,satisfied at last; he confesses he had enough for many years; he bids his
3104,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"soul take its ease; and yet for all that, God says to him, “Thou fool,"
3105,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"this night thy soul shall be required of thee, and the things thou hast"
3106,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"laid up, whom shall they belong to?”  Where shall we find the causes of"
3107,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"this bitter reproach and terrible judgment; we may find, I think, two,"
3108,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"and God perhaps saw more.  First, that he did not intend true rest to the"
3109,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"soul, but only to change the employments of it from avarice to luxury;"
3110,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"his design is to eat and to drink, and to be merry.  Secondly, that he"
3111,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,went on too long before he thought of resting; the fulness of his old
3112,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"barns had not sufficed him, he would stay till he was forced to build new"
3113,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"ones, and God meted out to him in the same measure; since he would have"
3114,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,"more riches than his life could contain, God destroyed his life and gave"
3115,THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.,the fruits of it to another.

3221,THE DANGER OF PROCRASTINATION.,I AM glad that you approve and applaud my design of withdrawing myself
3222,THE DANGER OF PROCRASTINATION.,from all tumult and business of the world and consecrating the little
3223,THE DANGER OF PROCRASTINATION.,rest of my time to those studies to which nature had so motherly inclined

3228,THE DANGER OF PROCRASTINATION.,"complaisance, till I had gotten such an estate as might afford me,"
3229,THE DANGER OF PROCRASTINATION.,"according to the saying of that person whom you and I love very much, and"
3230,THE DANGER OF PROCRASTINATION.,"would believe as soon as another man, _cum dignitate otium_.  This were"
3231,THE DANGER OF PROCRASTINATION.,"excellent advice to Joshua, who could bid the sun stay too.  But there’s"
3232,THE DANGER OF PROCRASTINATION.,no fooling with life when it is once turned beyond forty.  The seeking
3233,THE DANGER OF PROCRASTINATION.,"for a fortune then is but a desperate after game, it is a hundred to one"
3234,THE DANGER OF PROCRASTINATION.,if a man fling two sixes and recover all; especially if his hand be no
3235,THE DANGER OF PROCRASTINATION.,"luckier than mine.  There is some help for all the defects of fortune,"
3236,THE DANGER OF PROCRASTINATION.,"for if a man cannot attain to the length of his wishes, he may have his"
3237,THE DANGER OF PROCRASTINATION.,remedy by cutting of them shorter.  Epicurus writes a letter to

3241,THE DANGER OF PROCRASTINATION.,But I entreat you that you would not do it just the same way as you have
3242,THE DANGER OF PROCRASTINATION.,"done to many less deserving persons, but in the most gentlemanly manner"
3243,THE DANGER OF PROCRASTINATION.,"of obliging him, which is not to add anything to his estate, but to take"
3244,THE DANGER OF PROCRASTINATION.,"something from his desires.  The sum of this is, that for the uncertain"

3359,OF MYSELF.,IT is a hard and nice subject for a man to write of himself; it grates
3360,OF MYSELF.,his own heart to say anything of disparagement and the reader’s ears to
3361,OF MYSELF.,hear anything of praise for him.  There is no danger from me of offending
3362,OF MYSELF.,"him in this kind; neither my mind, nor my body, nor my fortune allow me"

3364,OF MYSELF.,"that they have preserved me from being scandalous, or remarkable on the"

3367,OF MYSELF.,likelier thereby to fall into the contempt than rise up to the estimation
3368,OF MYSELF.,"of most people.  As far as my memory can return back into my past life,"
3369,OF MYSELF.,"before I knew or was capable of guessing what the world, or glories, or"

3372,OF MYSELF.,"others, by an antipathy imperceptible to themselves and inscrutable to"
3373,OF MYSELF.,"man’s understanding.  Even when I was a very young boy at school, instead"
3374,OF MYSELF.,"of running about on holidays and playing with my fellows, I was wont to"
3375,OF MYSELF.,"steal from them and walk into the fields, either alone with a book, or"
3376,OF MYSELF.,"with some one companion, if I could find any of the same temper.  I was"

3379,OF MYSELF.,"without book the common rules of grammar, in which they dispensed with me"

3382,OF MYSELF.,now (which I confess I wonder at myself) may appear by the latter end of
3383,OF MYSELF.,"an ode which I made when I was but thirteen years old, and which was then"
3384,OF MYSELF.,"printed with many other verses.  The beginning of it is boyish, but of"

3414,XI.,"And in this true delight,"
3415,XI.,"These unbought sports, this happy state,"
3416,XI.,"I would not fear, nor wish my fate,"
3417,XI.,"But boldly say each night,"
3418,XI.,To-morrow let my sun his beams display
3419,XI.,Or in clouds hide them—I have lived to-day.
3420,XI.,
3421,XI.,You may see by it I was even then acquainted with the poets (for the
3422,XI.,"conclusion is taken out of Horace), and perhaps it was the immature and"
3423,XI.,"immoderate love of them which stamped first, or rather engraved, these"
3424,XI.,characters in me.  They were like letters cut into the bark of a young
3425,XI.,"tree, which with the tree still grow proportionably.  But how this love"
3426,XI.,came to be produced in me so early is a hard question.  I believe I can
3427,XI.,tell the particular little chance that filled my head first with such
3428,XI.,chimes of verse as have never since left ringing there.  For I remember
3429,XI.,"when I begun to read and to take some pleasure in it, there was wont to"
3430,XI.,"lie in my mother’s parlour.  (I know not by what accident, for she"
3431,XI.,"herself never in her life read any book but of devotion), but there was"
3432,XI.,"wont to lie Spenser’s works; this I happened to fall upon, and was"
3433,XI.,"infinitely delighted with the stories of the knights, and giants, and"
3434,XI.,"monsters, and brave houses, which I found everywhere there (though my"
3435,XI.,understanding had little to do with all this); and by degrees with the
3436,XI.,"tinkling of the rhyme and dance of the numbers, so that I think I had"
3437,XI.,"read him all over before I was twelve years old, and was thus made a poet"
3438,XI.,as immediately as a child is made an eunuch.  With these affections of
3439,XI.,"mind, and my heart wholly set upon letters, I went to the university, but"
3440,XI.,was soon torn from thence by that violent public storm which would suffer
3441,XI.,"nothing to stand where it did, but rooted up every plant, even from the"
3442,XI.,"princely cedars to me, the hyssop.  Yet I had as good fortune as could"
3443,XI.,have befallen me in such a tempest; for I was cast by it into the family
3444,XI.,"of one of the best persons, and into the court of one of the best"
3445,XI.,princesses of the world.  Now though I was here engaged in ways most
3446,XI.,"contrary to the original design of my life, that is, into much company,"
3447,XI.,"and no small business, and into a daily sight of greatness, both militant"
3448,XI.,"and triumphant, for that was the state then of the English and French"
3449,XI.,"Courts; yet all this was so far from altering my opinion, that it only"
3450,XI.,added the confirmation of reason to that which was before but natural
3451,XI.,"inclination.  I saw plainly all the paint of that kind of life, the"
3452,XI.,nearer I came to it; and that beauty which I did not fall in love with
3453,XI.,"when, for aught I knew, it was real, was not like to bewitch or entice me"
3454,XI.,"when I saw that it was adulterate.  I met with several great persons,"
3455,XI.,"whom I liked very well, but could not perceive that any part of their"
3456,XI.,"greatness was to be liked or desired, no more than I would be glad or"
3457,XI.,"content to be in a storm, though I saw many ships which rid safely and"
3458,XI.,"bravely in it.  A storm would not agree with my stomach, if it did with"
3459,XI.,my courage.  Though I was in a crowd of as good company as could be found
3460,XI.,"anywhere, though I was in business of great and honourable trust, though"
3461,XI.,"I ate at the best table, and enjoyed the best conveniences for present"
3462,XI.,subsistence that ought to be desired by a man of my condition in
3463,XI.,"banishment and public distresses, yet I could not abstain from renewing"
3464,XI.,my old schoolboy’s wish in a copy of verses to the same effect.
3465,XI.,
3466,XI.,"Well then; I now do plainly see,"
3467,XI.,"This busy world and I shall ne’er agree, etc."
3468,XI.,
3469,XI.,And I never then proposed to myself another advantage from His Majesty’s
3470,XI.,"happy restoration, but the getting into some moderately convenient"
3471,XI.,"retreat in the country, which I thought in that case I might easily have"
3472,XI.,"compassed, as well as some others, with no greater probabilities or"
3473,XI.,pretences have arrived to extraordinary fortunes.  But I had before
3474,XI.,"written a shrewd prophecy against myself, and I think Apollo inspired me"
3475,XI.,"in the truth, though not in the elegance of it."
3476,XI.,
3477,XI.,"Thou, neither great at court nor in the war,"
3478,XI.,"Nor at th’ exchange shalt be, nor at the wrangling bar;"
3479,XI.,"Content thyself with the small barren praise,"
3480,XI.,"Which neglected verse does raise, etc."
3481,XI.,
3482,XI.,"However, by the failing of the forces which I had expected, I did not"
3483,XI.,quit the design which I had resolved on; I cast myself into it _A corps
3484,XI.,"perdu_, without making capitulations or taking counsel of fortune.  But"
3485,XI.,"God laughs at a man who says to his soul, “Take thy ease”: I met"
3486,XI.,"presently not only with many little encumbrances and impediments, but"
3487,XI.,with so much sickness (a new misfortune to me) as would have spoiled the
3488,XI.,happiness of an emperor as well as mine.  Yet I do neither repent nor
3489,XI.,alter my course.  _Non ego perfidum dixi sacramentum_.  Nothing shall
3490,XI.,"separate me from a mistress which I have loved so long, and have now at"
3491,XI.,"last married, though she neither has brought me a rich portion, nor lived"
3492,XI.,yet so quietly with me as I hoped from her.
3493,XI.,
3494,XI.,"—_Nec vos_, _dulcissima mundi_"
3495,XI.,"_Nomina_, _vos Musæ_, _libertas_, _otia_, _libri_,"
3496,XI.,_Hortique sylvesque anima remanente relinquam_.
3497,XI.,

3500,XI.,"You Muses, books, and liberty, and rest;"
3501,XI.,"You gardens, fields, and woods forsaken be,"
3502,XI.,As long as life itself forsakes not me.
3503,XI.,
3504,XI.,But this is a very petty ejaculation.  Because I have concluded all the
3505,XI.,"other chapters with a copy of verses, I will maintain the humour to the"
3506,XI.,last.
