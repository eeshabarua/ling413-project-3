119,A FUGUE OF HELL.,
120,A FUGUE OF HELL.,
121,I.,I.
122,I.,
123,I.,I dreamed a mighty dream. It seemed mine eyes
124,I.,"Sealed for the moment were to things terrene,"
125,I.,"And then there came a strange, great wind that blew"
126,I.,"From undiscovered lands, and took my soul"
127,I.,And set it on an uttermost peak of Hell
128,I.,Amid the gloom and fearful silences.
129,I.,"Slowly the darkness paled, and a weird dawn"
130,I.,"Broke on my wondering vision, and there grew"
131,I.,Uncanny phosphorescence in the air
132,I.,Which seemed to throb with some great vital spell
133,I.,Of mystery and doom. With aching eyes
134,I.,"I gazed, and lo! the dreadful scene evolved,"
135,I.,"Black and chaotic, like an awful birth"
136,I.,"To Desolation, of a lifeless world!"
137,I.,"My soul in agony cried out to God,"
138,I.,"When of a sudden all the place grew calm,"
139,I.,Save for the trembling of the mountain peaks
140,I.,And the low moaning of the billowy winds
141,I.,Among the abysses. Dull lights here and there
142,I.,"Kindled, like wreckage of a city razed"
143,I.,"By vandals, and the inky sky cupped up"
144,I.,"Into a black, impenetrable roof...."
145,I.,But now from out the chaos there arose
146,I.,Another sound more fearful than the wail
147,I.,"Of tempest, or the quake of mighty hills--"
148,I.,"A mortal cry, a human voice in Hell!"
149,I.,
150,I.,
151,II.,II.
152,II.,
153,II.,"The infernal glare grew brighter, and there came"
154,II.,"Unto mine ears the sound of many tongues,"
155,II.,Mingling discordant curse with bitter cry
156,II.,Of lamentation. On the outer marge
157,II.,"Of Hell's domains, set one at each of four"
158,II.,"Far sundered corners, four volcanoes grim"
159,II.,Spewed up their flaming bowels into a sea
160,II.,Of blackness whence no light could issue forth.
161,II.,"Beyond this fierce horizon, farther yet"
162,II.,"Than vision's wing could bear my gaze, I knew"
163,II.,"Hell's desolate kingdoms stretched their iron wastes,"
164,II.,"Hell's burning mountains waved their brands of flame,"
165,II.,Hell's lava rivers plunged in fury down
166,II.,Their adamantine beds.
167,II.,
168,II.,The human cry
169,II.,"Deepened,--the stunning babel shrieked and roared"
170,II.,As though some mighty revolution swept
171,II.,The flying hosts along--some pang too keen
172,II.,For the immortal and transcendent pains
173,II.,"Of Hell to quench, was burning in their souls."
174,II.,
175,II.,
176,III.,III.
177,III.,
178,III.,Slowly mine eyes pierced through the pallid light
179,III.,"That crowned the awful place, and then I saw"
180,III.,That which shall not be seen of mortal eye
181,III.,Until the final day. I saw the vast
182,III.,Black concourse of Inferno pouring in
183,III.,"From Hell's four sides, and gathering at the base"
184,III.,Of a stupendous mountain whose great crest
185,III.,"Towered high above the glare, and lost itself"
186,III.,In blackness. Never met such throng before
187,III.,In Hell or Heaven. Flowing round the mount
188,III.,"Like a huge deluge, from afar they came,"
189,III.,"And near. A dreadful sound was on mine ears,"
190,III.,As when the first great call of deep to deep
191,III.,"Broke on the natal silence, or as when"
192,III.,The wailing cry of universal death
193,III.,Shall shake the pillars of eternity!
194,III.,
195,III.,"Still came the multitudes, and still the sea"
196,III.,Of human souls surged round the iron base
197,III.,"Of that mysterious mountain, while afar"
198,III.,The dim circumference was added to
199,III.,"With newer legions. Conquerors of old,"
200,III.,"Armored and visored in resplendent steel,"
201,III.,"Galloped on Hell-steeds, that with one great bound"
202,III.,Cleared bottomless cañons; then the kings and queens
203,III.,"Of Babylon, shorn of their lofty state,"
204,III.,"Came abject, and with terror in those eyes"
205,III.,"That once outshone the world; and after them,"
206,III.,"Myriads who reveled at the feast of life,"
207,III.,And when the reeling stupor of their wine
208,III.,"Had loosened, woke and found their souls in Hell."
209,III.,
210,III.,
211,IV.,IV.
212,IV.,
213,IV.,"What horrid crisis, then, I thought, can bring"
214,IV.,The infernal minions to assemble here
215,IV.,Within the shadow of this gloomy peak
216,IV.,That seems to thrust aloft its fearful head
217,IV.,Even to God's footstool? Then as if there came
218,IV.,"Answer direct to my soul's questioning,"
219,IV.,"A great voice lifted from the throng, which seemed"
220,IV.,"To bear up heaven-high its might of words,"
221,IV.,"Crying: ""Thou wan inheritors of pain,"
222,IV.,"Angels and princes, ministers of Hell,"
223,IV.,"Hearken! The day of all great days is come,"
224,IV.,Commemorative of that legend old
225,IV.,Whose prophecy is that when the time has run
226,IV.,"A million æons out, if God relent,"
227,IV.,A symbol shall be set upon the top
228,IV.,Of yonder mount--a blazing star--to tell
229,IV.,"That hope is not yet dead. O powers of night,"
230,IV.,Children of woe and darkness! not again
231,IV.,Shall Hell know such a gathering as this
232,IV.,"Until, if hope be not forever fled,"
233,IV.,"The day of our redemption shall arrive!"""
234,IV.,"The voice ceased and a murmur ran through Hell,"
235,IV.,"A fearful whisper, scarcely breathing, ""Hope!"""
236,IV.,"Then louder, as when storms begin to blow,"
237,IV.,"Gusty and fitful, and the word was ""Hope!"""
238,IV.,"Then, rising like a tempest, swelling high"
239,IV.,"In vast crescendo, swept the human cry,"
240,IV.,"And all Hell's thunderous gamut answered ""_Hope!_"""
241,IV.,
242,IV.,
243,V.,V.
244,V.,
245,V.,"The shouts ceased, and the exultation died"
246,V.,"Slowly into a sort of empty wail,"
247,V.,"Half hope and half despair, for still the sign"
248,V.,Had not yet blazed upon their eager eyes.
249,V.,"Then as I sat in wondering agony,"
250,V.,"Praying, yet fearing, for the greatest cause"
251,V.,That ever souls of men in balance set
252,V.,"'Gainst everlasting doom, there rose again"
253,V.,"The voice of their great leader, Lucifer,"
254,V.,"The rebel angel, and outcast of God:"
255,V.,"""Lo, hosts of Hell,"" he cried, ""inheritors"
256,V.,"Of death diurnal, strangely mingled with"
257,V.,"Relentless life, what shall we say to God"
258,V.,"Who waits and watches? Shall we pray or curse,"
259,V.,Implore or threaten? Can we move Him thus?
260,V.,Burn not the lightnings yet in His right hand
261,V.,With which He struck us to confusion once?
262,V.,And laughs He not in thunderbolts the same
263,V.,As once pursued our howling flight to Hell?
264,V.,"Befits it rather, think ye not, my hosts,"
265,V.,That we should send on high in one accord
266,V.,"A mighty threnody--a hymn of Hell,"
267,V.,"Inspired by pain and sung in bitterest woe,"
268,V.,"As our best offering,--and await His word?"""
269,V.,
270,V.,"He ceased, and for the moment all was still;"
271,V.,Then plaintive as the rhythmic dawn of stars
272,V.,"Upon a night of sorrow, rose a strain"
273,V.,"Of lamentation, such as when the sea"
274,V.,Makes moan unto an earthquake's inward throes.
275,V.,Then circling outward passed the rising tones
276,V.,"Of that sad minstrelsy, and then again"
277,V.,Backward it swept like a great tidal wave
278,V.,"Of anguish, all Hell's anarchy of grief"
279,V.,Set to a sounding fugue. Grim-throated rose
280,V.,"The awful hymn, and mingling with the wail"
281,V.,"Of voices, pealed the cymbals' brassy clang;"
282,V.,"The thunderous organs bellowed through the gloom,"
283,V.,"And, rocking Hell's foundations, burst a blare"
284,V.,"Of stormy trumpets crying: ""Woe, woe, woe!"""
285,V.,"Methought the angels must have wept to hear,"
286,V.,Methought their tears had dropt like healing rain
287,V.,"Upon the fires of torment, and assuaged"
288,V.,"Their blazing wrath, so piteous was the strain."
289,V.,
290,V.,"The music ceased, the echoes sobbed away"
291,V.,"Like a tumultuous sorrow, when, behold!"
292,V.,"The black veil lifted from the mountain's crest,"
293,V.,And on its glorious summit flamed _the Star_!

373,THE TORNADO.,God let me fall from His hand
374,THE TORNADO.,One day at His forge when the elemental world
375,THE TORNADO.,"Was shaping. I am but a breath from His great bellows,"
376,THE TORNADO.,But here among the workshops of mankind
377,THE TORNADO.,I am a fateful scourge.
378,THE TORNADO.,
379,THE TORNADO.,I tear red strips from the proud cities of men;
380,THE TORNADO.,I name my passage the Highway of Instant Death;
381,THE TORNADO.,"I splinter world-old forests with my laugh,"
382,THE TORNADO.,And whirl the ancient snows of Hecla sheer into Orion's eyes.
383,THE TORNADO.,"I dance on the deep under the big Indian stars,"
384,THE TORNADO.,And wrap the water spout about my sinuous hips
385,THE TORNADO.,"As a dancer winds her girdle. The ocean's horrid crew,"
386,THE TORNADO.,"The octopus, the serpent, and the shark, with the heart of a coward,"
387,THE TORNADO.,"Plunge downward when they hear my feet above on the sea-floor,"

392,THE TORNADO.,
393,THE TORNADO.,"I am a breath from God's forge. I remember His awful workshop,"
394,THE TORNADO.,"How the hot globes spun off into infinite darkness, as system by"

396,THE TORNADO.,"The universe was wrought; and then I remember the birth of the sun,"
397,THE TORNADO.,"How God cried: ""Let there be light!"" and, blinding, bewildering,"
398,THE TORNADO.,"exulting,"
399,THE TORNADO.,"The great orb flamed from His furnace, and only the Creator stood"
400,THE TORNADO.,upright.
401,THE TORNADO.,In that hour I fell from His hand.
402,THE TORNADO.,
