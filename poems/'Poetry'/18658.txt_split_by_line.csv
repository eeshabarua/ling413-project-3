90,I,I
91,I,
92,I,To those who have been in Southern Europe and have seen the towns along
93,I,"the Riviera, the first view of Macao, as the steamboat approaches from"
94,I,"Hong Kong, gives the impression of having been suddenly transported to"
95,I,"the sunny Mediterranean. Were it not for the colour of the water, and"
96,I,"the Chinese junks, Macao would indeed be a perfect representation of any"
97,I,"of those lovely spots, as she lies along her crescent bay, from Mount"
98,I,"Nillau to Mount Charil, defended by the frowning forts of Sam Francisco"
99,I,"and Our Lady of Bom Parto. Beautiful as this picture is, it was doubly"
100,I,"so in the brilliant sunset colouring of a certain March day, as the"
101,I,steamer slowly came to her wharf and the passengers stepped ashore
102,I,"beneath the blue and white flag of Portugal, in this, her farthest"
103,I,"eastern possession. The houses with their delicate washings of pink,"
104,I,"blue, yellow or green, with white stucco ornaments, now golden in the"
105,I,"light, had a warmth of colouring well set off by the dark foliage of"
106,I,camphor and banyan trees showing above the garden walls. The few
107,I,"passengers soon dispersed, in chairs or on foot, leaving but one of"
108,I,their number upon the wharf. He was apparently expecting some one to
109,I,"come for him, for he refused all offers of assistance from the coolies"
110,I,"and seated himself just outside the gate. American, of medium height,"
111,I,"brown haired and tanned by a tropical sun, Robert Adams was as good a"
112,I,specimen of Anglo Saxon youth as England herself could boast of. He was
113,I,"the last descendant of a New England family, which had preserved its"
114,I,purity for three centuries as unmixed with continental blood as though
115,I,"the three centuries had been passed in the quiet vales of Devon, instead"
116,I,of in the New World with its broken barriers.
117,I,
118,I,"For three years, after a successful college course, he had been in the"
119,I,only shipping house in Hong Kong which sickly American commerce of the
120,I,day was able to support in the once flourishing China trade. A small
121,I,"fortune and a good salary, a constitution which even an Eastern summer"
122,I,"could not break down, and above all, the heart of the girl he loved,"
123,I,were surely possessions which any king might envy him. Presently a neat
124,I,bamboo chair borne by three liveried coolies came at a trot down the
125,I,"street, and being placed before this last of the passengers, carried him"
126,I,"away into the darkness which, with the suddenness of the tropics, had"
127,I,fallen upon the city. The stillness was broken only by the noise of
128,I,escaping steam from the boat and the regular patter of the barefooted
129,I,"chair carriers. When the chair had disappeared up the narrow, winding"
130,I,"street, a Portuguese wrapped in a black cloak came from behind a wall,"
131,I,then by another way walked rapidly over the hill and down the other
132,I,"side to the Praya, arriving in front of one of the largest houses on"
133,I,that most beautiful promenade just as the coolies put down their burden.
134,I,
135,I,"The oil lamps along the Praya had been lighted, stretching out to the"
136,I,"Estrada Sam Francisco, where the bright windows in the hospital of Sam"
137,I,Januarius seemed to be the lake of lights into which this long stream
138,I,"flowed. No one was abroad, no steps sounded along the pavement except"
139,I,"those of the sentry as he walked, and _smoked_, before the neighbouring"
140,I,residence of the Governor. Death at night and sleep in the day time are
141,I,"the characteristics of Macao. No one seems to work, play, sing, dance or"
142,I,even read unless the latter indeed may be done in what Alphonse Daudet
143,I,calls _la Bibliotheque des cigales_.
144,I,
145,I,"As Robert Adams stepped from the chair, the Portuguese came forward with"
146,I,"outstretched hand saying: ""What is the news Dom Robert in Hong Kong?"""
147,I,"""Oh, Dom Pedro, you came out so suddenly I thought I was attacked. No"
148,I,"news, unless it is that the rector of St. John's is to join me to the"
149,I,"loveliest girl in Macao or the world, in just three weeks."" ""I hope you"
150,I,"won't disappoint him Dom Robert, you came very near doing so to-night,"""
151,I,"said Pedro de Amaral with a laugh. ""How, pray?"" asked Adams as they"
152,I,"entered the now unbarred gate. ""You were within three feet of the water,"
153,I,"if you had fallen in, that would have disappointed him. Not? Three feet"
154,I,"is near. Not?"" ""Yes, and the boiler might have burst,"" replied Adams"
155,I,"laughing. ""Or more improbable yet the Portuguese government might have"
156,I,"revived Macao, which would kill me with astonishment my dear Amaral."""
157,I,
158,I,"Having entered the house he was followed by Dom Pedro, who bent upon him"
159,I,such a look of hatred as only the eyes of Latin races can give. The
160,I,Portuguese turned to the right to his own apartments and Adams following
161,I,"a servant to the left, was soon in the dimly lighted library of Dom Luiz"
162,I,de Amaral the father of Dom Pedro. There were not many books on the
163,I,shelves but a superb collection of Oriental swords and knives was
164,I,arranged in the cases from which the shelves had been taken. Two old
165,I,"engravings, one of the poet Camoens and the other of Catarina de Atayde,"
166,I,"his beloved, who died of grief at his banishment, hung on the wall; the"
167,I,rest of the furnishings was of that cosmopolitan character which is sure
168,I,to collect in the home of a European resident in the far East.
169,I,
170,I,"""Can't you see me Robert?"" said a laughing voice of great sweetness from"
171,I,"a corner of the study. ""One would think that both your eyes had met the"
172,I,"same fate that the right one of poor Camoens did in Morocco."" ""My"
173,I,darling Priscilla how could I see you ten feet away from the light? You
174,I,know olive oil don't give the brightest illumination. But its enough
175,I,"though."" ""Don't!"" ""Just one,"" and then a sound not unknown to many of us"
176,I,"put a stop to the conversation. ""Shall I leave the room children?"" came"
177,I,in merry tones from another corner and immediately an old lady came
178,I,"forward giving both hands to him. ""That miserable oil of Dom Amaral's"
179,I,"has put me into a pretty mess,"" said Adams half annoyed, but laughing as"
180,I,"he greeted the lady. ""Don't berate me before my face dear friend about"
181,I,"my light, especially when you are so soon to take our brightest light"
182,I,"away from us."" ""Fairly trapped, Dom Amaral,"" cried Adams laughing"
183,I,"heartily at this third interruption. ""And here is Dom Pedro dressed for"
184,I,"dinner,"" he continued as the younger Amaral entered the room. ""I'll be"
185,I,"with you presently and have my eyes toned down to your Macao standard."""
186,I,
187,I,"Being so constant a visitor, Robert Adams had his own rooms at Dom"
188,I,"Amaral's, where he found his bags unpacked and the clothes laid out by"
189,I,"those deftest of servants, the Chinese. According to custom the dinner"
190,I,of Macao was served at the late hour of nine.
191,I,
192,I,Dom Luiz Diego de Amaral was one of the wealthiest Portuguese in the
193,I,"city, having, unlike most of his fellow citizens, investments abroad"
194,I,which brought him a considerable income after the birth of Hong Kong
195,I,"killed Macao and left it a city of the past, of poverty and pride."
196,I,"Having in his youth married a Spanish woman who bore him one son, Pedro,"
197,I,he was left a widower before the age of twenty-five.
198,I,
199,I,"Some years after, being in Boston where he then had large shipping"
200,I,"interests, he took a second wife, Priscilla Harvey, and returned to"
201,I,"Macao. Madam de Amaral's only sister, wife of Captain Fernald had one"
202,I,child which was left an orphan at an early age by the drowning of both
203,I,parents in Portsmouth harbour.
204,I,
205,I,"This orphan, Priscilla Fernald, was taken to her aunt in China and"
206,I,became a member of the household of Dom Amaral. It was a strange
207,I,transplanting for such a flower from the cold coast of Puritan New
208,I,"England to the tropical, Roman Catholic colony in the heart of"
209,I,heathendom. But the flower of so sturdy a stock remained true. It was
210,I,"long accepted by all, even by the maiden Priscilla, that young Amaral"
211,I,was to be her husband though nothing had been said on the subject.
212,I,"Later, the small circle of Macao society, of which poverty and pride"
213,I,"were the ruling features, became too dull for the young girl and her"
214,I,foster parents took her often to Hong Kong where she met with those of
215,I,the outer world.
216,I,
217,I,"In that hospitable society of the ""city of the fragrant streams,"" where"
218,I,"the dinner table seems to be the only rendezvous, save a garden party"
219,I,"now and then, a Tarrantella dance or a Government House ball, the fair"
220,I,"Priscilla met young Robert Adams, a native of her far away and almost"
221,I,unknown home. The acquaintance blossomed into friendship and ripened
222,I,"into love. The lover was accepted, and now a courtship of two years was"
223,I,in three weeks to see them married. There were many disappointed youths
224,I,"and envious of Robert Adams, but all took their misfortune as in the way"
225,I,"of the world, except young Amaral, who, in silence, had watched the"
226,I,course of events and now hated the happy suitor with all the fierceness
227,I,of his Southern blood.
228,I,
229,I,"That night Robert Adams, unlike the conventional lover, but like a"
230,I,"healthy, light-hearted fellow, fell asleep without a sigh, listening to"
231,I,the waves as they broke regularly on the stone embankment before his
232,I,"window. In the room below, Dom Pedro walked until the early morning, no"
233,I,"beating of waves could lull him to sleep, for his head ached and his"
234,I,eyes burned in the fever of jealousy. Thus he brooded over his loss till
235,I,the sun gilded the hermitage fort of Our Lady of Guia.
236,I,
237,I,
238,II.,II.
239,II.,
240,II.,"The following day was Sunday, the liveliest, or rather the only day with"
241,II.,"any life at all, in Macao, for the visitors from Hong Kong then go about"
242,II.,the city sight seeing to be ready for the early return of the steamboat
243,II.,on Monday morning.
244,II.,
245,II.,"A pleasant spot, and one not often molested by visitors on account of"
246,II.,"the somewhat toilsome climb required to reach it, is the church of Our"
247,II.,Lady of Pehna on the summit of Mt. Nillau. Built in 1622 on this high
248,II.,point to be more easily protected from any possible invasion of the
249,II.,"Chinese from the main island of Heang Shang, the church serves now only"
250,II.,"as an addition to the picturesqueness of Macao, and though repaired in"
251,II.,1837 is again in ruin. Priscilla and her affianced chose this for their
252,II.,"Sabbath walk, for it is only through nature that the Protestants in"
253,II.,"Macao can worship nature's God, and surely the incense of flowers could"
254,II.,"bear to Him on high the thanksgiving of those two happy hearts, as truly"
255,II.,as the frankincense and myrrh which the good Fathers of the last century
256,II.,burnt upon Mt. Nillau. The narrow but well paved streets with their
257,II.,"stuccoed houses, barred windows and little peep-holes at the doors, for"
258,II.,"questioning the doubtful applicants for admission, even the two months"
259,II.,old posters of Chiarini's circus had a new charm this Sunday morning;
260,II.,for Adams it was a day of quiet after his week of noise and bustle in
261,II.,"Hong Kong, while for Priscilla it seemed a gala day full of life after"
262,II.,"the six silent days of sleepy monotony. ""I can see that Pedro is not"
263,II.,"friendly toward you Robert,"" she said; ""I could hear him walking during"
264,II.,"all the night and am sure he is planning something to annoy you, I know"
265,II.,"his ways so well."" ""Don't worry, Priscilla, Dom Pedro was probably"
266,II.,troubled over some loss at the fan-tan table; they say he won five
267,II.,"hundred Mexicans last week and then lost that sum doubled."""
268,II.,
269,II.,"""That may be so, Robert, but our approaching marriage is a great cross"
270,II.,to him. It is hard to tell what Pedro's thoughts are; his eyes are like
271,II.,"our Macao windows of isinglass and let very little light either way."""
272,II.,
273,II.,"The winding road between ruined walls of gray stone, half covered with"
274,II.,"clinging ficus, spanned by broken arches, with here and there a fallen"
275,II.,"urn, led them through picturesque turns and by mossy steps to the foot"
276,II.,of the huge black cross erected before the empty church. Neither spoke;
277,II.,they did not care for words and the only expression which framed itself
278,II.,"audibly was that oft repeated _jubilate_ of health and youth, ""How"
279,II.,"beautiful it is to live!"""
280,II.,
281,II.,"Dim in the distance, of almost the same shade as the sky, rose the"
282,II.,White Cloud Hills; lesser hills more distinct in waving outline lay
283,II.,before them; then rocky promontories and islands with grotesque forms
284,II.,"like the twisted dragons of Chinese embroideries, and the low stretch"
285,II.,which marked the position of the wonderful city of Canton. On the yellow
286,II.,water here and there were junks with tanned sails and gay banners;
287,II.,"islands with graceful pagodas were seen, and the huge white cathedral of"
288,II.,the near dependency of Taipa. Then in the foreground at their very feet
289,II.,"was Macao, a feast of colour, red roofs, many-hued walls, green trees"
290,II.,"and brilliant gardens, beautiful as the jewel-set sheath of a Venetian"
291,II.,"dagger, with its poison and death-dealing wickedness hidden."
292,II.,
293,II.,Dom Amaral with his wife had gone to the new cathedral to services;
294,II.,their well appointed chairs had scarcely left the court and the gates
295,II.,been bolted behind them when Dom Pedro came from his room. His face had
296,II.,changed greatly since the day before; the loss of sleep and the
297,II.,bitterness of his heart had made him look pale and thin. For the first
298,II.,"time in his life he had spoken harshly to his valet, and that meek"
299,II.,"Celestial wore an expression of grief and surprise, for Pedro Amaral,"
300,II.,"whatever his faults, did not have the vulgar one of venting his spleen"
301,II.,"upon his inferiors, so that his lifelong servant was at a loss to"
302,II.,account for the sudden change.
303,II.,
304,II.,Dom Pedro walked to the library and drawing the curtains behind him sat
305,II.,down before the cases filled with brilliant steel. Suddenly he looked
306,II.,"away and picked up a book from the table, opening it at random but"
307,II.,constantly his eyes reverted to the cases before him. Slowly his
308,II.,features relaxed and with a broken sigh he was about to replace the book
309,II.,when a small photograph card fell from its pages; the face was that of
310,II.,"Robert Adams, the book Priscilla's ""Common Prayer."" Like a flash the old"
311,II.,lines came back in his forehead; he went to the case and opening the
312,II.,"glass doors, carefully took down a small, silver sheath, the work of"
313,II.,"some artist of Goa, wherein the influence of both India and Europe"
314,II.,showed in the execution. The pressure of a button pushed out a grooved
315,II.,dagger which fitted so low in the sheath as to show only the head of its
316,II.,"jeweled hilt. Dom Pedro removed the dagger, wrapped it in his"
317,II.,handkerchief and then putting it in his breast pocket replaced the empty
318,II.,sheath in its old position.
319,II.,
320,II.,
321,III.,III.
322,III.,
323,III.,The government of Macao derives its greatest revenue from the licensing
324,III.,"of gambling houses, and these form one of the principal attractions in"
325,III.,the city to the European from Hong Kong as well as the native
326,III.,"Portuguese and Chinese. Whatever fault the visitor finds, on moral"
327,III.,"grounds, with these houses he must admit the fact that they are quiet"
328,III.,"and orderly, while the picturesqueness of the life within them and that"
329,III.,peculiar glamour which varnishes all that pertains to a great gambling
330,III.,"hall where fortune shows herself directly face to face with us, has a"
331,III.,charm which hides the immorality from even the most straight-laced
332,III.,Puritan.
333,III.,
334,III.,"One of these houses was the favourite and nightly resort of Dom Pedro,"
335,III.,where he played high or low according to the state of his finances at
336,III.,"the moment. Dom Amaral, though himself a devotee of the fan-tan table,"
337,III.,observed with fear this controlling passion of his son which he believed
338,III.,would some day destroy the comfortable fortune he had amassed with so
339,III.,many years of labour.
340,III.,
341,III.,Adams would have certainly preferred to spend the whole evening in the
342,III.,"family circle, but Dom Pedro urged him with so much, and such unusual"
343,III.,"kindness to accompany him to the gambling house that he consented, and"
344,III.,at about eleven o'clock the two young men left the Praya and walked into
345,III.,the town beneath the soft lights of the oil lamps. The streets were
346,III.,"deserted as usual, here and there a policeman, hooded like a pilgrim,"
347,III.,"sauntered leisurely along, or the Chinese watchman with drum and"
348,III.,clapper woke the echoes of the lonely ways warning thieves of his
349,III.,approach.
350,III.,
351,III.,The only illuminated houses were fan-tan houses and these presently
352,III.,became numerous; now and then music was heard but not of a very
353,III.,"seductive kind. Into one of the largest and most gaily decorated houses,"
354,III.,"Dom Pedro and Robert Adams went, climbing to the second floor by stairs"
355,III.,bordered with shrubs in huge Chinese pots.
356,III.,
357,III.,The main playing room contained several tables or counters arranged
358,III.,"along the walls, behind which sat the croupiers; at one of these Dom"
359,III.,Pedro stopped. On the table was a plate of metal divided into quarters
360,III.,"of about a foot square by deep cut lines crossing it, each square being"
361,III.,"marked in Chinese characters indicating one, two, three and four. The"
362,III.,"croupiers rattled a pile of bright brass coins, with square holes in"
363,III.,"them, called cash; then as Dom Pedro made a sign that he was about to"
364,III.,"play, the croupier drew away a part of them under a bowl and Dom Pedro"
365,III.,placed his wager on number three. The croupier with a bamboo wand then
366,III.,"counted out the remaining cash one at a time in sets of four, until"
367,III.,"finally there were but three left; this being Dom Pedro's number, he won"
368,III.,the stakes.
369,III.,
370,III.,"""In good luck to-night,"" he said, turning to Adams, ""Try if this is a"
371,III.,"lucky day for you."" Robert Adams placed his money on the same square"
372,III.,"which Dom Pedro had won from, and again the croupier counted the"
373,III.,"remainder slowly, having drawn away some of the cash under the bowl,"
374,III.,four at a time until but two remained and Adams' stake became part of
375,III.,"the bank. ""Lucky in love, unlucky at play"" he said with a laugh, ""I"
376,III.,"shall bet no more to-night."" Dom Pedro's face darkened but in silence he"
377,III.,continued winning at every count.
378,III.,
379,III.,Above the table was a square hole in the ceiling opening into an upper
380,III.,"room where those could sit who did not wish to be seen, and were thus"
381,III.,able to let their bets down in a little basket and with the same draw up
382,III.,their winnings. This upper room being purposely kept in half light
383,III.,enabled its occupants to see those below without being seen themselves.
384,III.,
385,III.,Dom Pedro's luck was astonishing and quite a crowd of onlookers gathered
386,III.,about. Robert Adams growing weary of the play in which he took no
387,III.,"interest, left, saying that he would walk slowly as far as the ruined"
388,III.,cathedral of St. Paul and on his return step in again. As he stepped
389,III.,back from the table he looked up toward the opening in the ceiling where
390,III.,"were two women with faces wrapped in black silk robosas, which showed"
391,III.,only the eyes; as the eyes seemed fixed upon him he raised his hat. The
392,III.,"action seemed to cause the women considerable consternation, for both"
393,III.,"hurriedly sprang back from the rail and in doing so one let fall, upon"
394,III.,"the table below, the basket with a bit of paper and several Mexican"
395,III.,dollars which rolled about the room. Everyone looked up laughing at the
396,III.,accident but no one from above claimed the money. Adams left the room
397,III.,"glad to be in the fresh air under the clear, starlit sky."
398,III.,
399,III.,No more lonely or picturesque ruin ever existed than the church of St.
400,III.,"Paul; though human habitations crowd close upon it, they are however the"
401,III.,houses of Chinese and make the Christian edifice seem the more solitary.
402,III.,The church is of that favourite style of architecture so common in new
403,III.,"and old Spain, which always brings to the mind of the wanderer in"
404,III.,foreign lands the name of good San Xavier.
405,III.,
406,III.,The half moon had risen high enough to illuminate the whole front as
407,III.,"Adams climbed the broad, massive steps to the paved space before it."
408,III.,Leaning against the heavy balustrade he enjoyed the picture. The shadows
409,III.,were deep and through the sightless windows shone a few silver stars.
410,III.,The magnificent front of solid granite with graceful scroll-work and
411,III.,"carved outline, blackened here by smoke and there by age, with vines and"
412,III.,"trees growing from crevices, stood in wondrous beauty."
413,III.,
414,III.,"The detail showed clearer than by day; the panels in high relief, of"
415,III.,"full rigged ship, the double dolphin and the skeleton seemed too fragile"
416,III.,to have stood through earthquake and typhoon and the conflagrations of
417,III.,war for more than two hundred years. The exquisite frieze composed of
418,III.,"many unconventionalized flowers extending across the front, wherein the"
419,III.,"artist and worker had been one, was a petrified garland. This scene was"
420,III.,"a revelation to Adams for often as he had viewed and sketched the ruin,"
421,III.,he had never been there by moonlight when its beauties were enhanced and
422,III.,its defects hidden. He could see plainly each Chinese character upon the
423,III.,"carved scrolls and the words ""Mater Dei"" above the doorway."
424,III.,
425,III.,"Slowly the shadows crept along, making the six broken saints in their"
426,III.,"niches seem alive; slowly the shadows upon the ruin crept along, but a"
427,III.,swifter shadow suddenly came forward from the steps and Adams having
428,III.,"forgotten, in the entrancing scene the murderer and thief who lurk in"
429,III.,"all Macao's corners, turned as he heard a soft step, just in time to"
430,III.,receive in his right arm the upward blow of a dagger aimed at his side.
431,III.,"He lost his balance falling backward down the steps, striking his head"
432,III.,"upon a heap of broken roof-tiles where he lay insensible. As he fell, a"
433,III.,woman's scream pierced the night. There was hurried tramping of sandaled
434,III.,"feet, as of a dozen or more coolies. The shriek was again heard and"
435,III.,then all was silent and the plaza empty.
436,III.,
437,III.,
438,IV,IV
439,IV,
440,IV,Sleepy Macao the day after the attempted assassination of Robert Adams
441,IV,was treated to a sensation such as had not been its experience since the
442,IV,memorable day in 1848 when the old Governor de Amaral lost his head at
443,IV,"the Porta de Cerco. Murder, attempted or accomplished, could not have"
444,IV,"stirred them up to such an extent, for that was too common an"
445,IV,"occurrence, but the mystery of the event was the cause. Priscilla Harvey"
446,IV,and her maid with one of Dom Amaral's most trusted men servants had
447,IV,disappeared as completely as though the earth had swallowed them.
448,IV,
449,IV,"Robert Adams, since the night of the attack had not recovered his"
450,IV,"senses, and lay in the house of Dom Amaral apparently between life and"
451,IV,death. The surgeons from Sam Januarius hospital had decided that to save
452,IV,"him, the amputation of his arm would be necessary, for the dagger which"
453,IV,had cut it had been poisoned.
454,IV,
455,IV,"In the midst of this trouble, Priscilla's absence was discovered, and"
456,IV,Macao was alarmed. Men were sent from the Governor's house in all
457,IV,"directions to search the public houses, the fishing boats, and every"
458,IV,possible place within the small territory. Word was sent to Taipa. While
459,IV,"the officials were thus employed, private parties of searchers went over"
460,IV,the entire peninsula looking among the rocks and copses of the Estrada
461,IV,"and even the Parsee Tower of Silence was examined, but all in vain. The"
462,IV,fan-tan house proprietor told of two unknown women with a Chinese
463,IV,"servant who had visited his house, but when they had left he did not"
464,IV,"know. No more was learned though the search still continued, for large"
465,IV,rewards were offered by Dom Amaral as well as by the Governor.
466,IV,
467,IV,"Dom Pedro directed the movements, taking greatest interest in all that"
468,IV,"seemed possible to form a clue, and did not rest for nearly forty-eight"
469,IV,"hours. Days soon formed a week but no news came, and Macao began to"
470,IV,"drowze again. Detectives from Hong Kong came, made the usual fuss and"
471,IV,"reached the usual conclusions of their kind, that it was a mysterious"
472,IV,event.
473,IV,
474,IV,"Contrary to all predictions Robert Adams, having become convalescent and"
475,IV,the surgical operation by which he had lost his arm having proved
476,IV,"successful when having heard the awful news, did not have a relapse into"
477,IV,"the fever but seemed with a determination to become more rapidly strong,"
478,IV,"and in five weeks was able to be about. He, of all Priscilla's friends,"
479,IV,was most hopeful. To his mind vividly came the scene at the Ruins of
480,IV,St. Paul and that last sound he had heard. Adams' first walk was to the
481,IV,"scene of his attempted assassination and Madam de Amaral, who was much"
482,IV,"broken with grief at the terrible event, accompanied him in her chair,"
483,IV,Dom Pedro going with them.
484,IV,
485,IV,It was the month of May and the heat being oppressive Madam d'Amaral
486,IV,after viewing the scene was carried home and the two young men walked on
487,IV,"to the Marcos garden. ""I have a clue Dom Robert,"" said Dom Pedro as they"
488,IV,seated themselves beneath a broad banyan tree from which a view of St.
489,IV,"Paul's ruin could be had. ""There began your troubles,"" he said pointing,"
490,IV,"""and there this morning I received a paper which will I hope lead to a"
491,IV,"solution of this mystery."" He handed Adams a bit of Chinese paper on"
492,IV,"which was written in Portuguese, ""Come to the Praca de Luiz de Camoens"
493,IV,"at 8 A.M. to-morrow; follow the guide who meets you, and the lady"
494,IV,"Priscilla will be found."" ""I do not trust anonymous communications,"""
495,IV,"said Adams, ""but we must clutch at a straw now."" ""Nor do I,"" replied Dom"
496,IV,"Pedro, ""and I will go with you; we will go well armed."" Adams glanced"
497,IV,down at his own empty sleeve and a cruel smile passed over the face of
498,IV,Dom Pedro as he noticed his comrade's pain.
499,IV,
500,IV,The 22nd of May will be long remembered in Macao and never forgotten by
501,IV,the family of de Amaral. Early in the morning Robert Adams was up and
502,IV,"impatiently waiting for Dom Pedro, who appeared a little before eight"
503,IV,"o'clock and the two, after a hurried breakfast, went to the Praca de"
504,IV,Luiz de Camoens where a Chinese sailor met them. They followed him to
505,IV,the shore where a sampan was waiting in which they seated themselves and
506,IV,were soon gliding rapidly toward a huge junk of fine build which lay at
507,IV,"anchor some distance beyond the Portuguese man-of-war, in the direction"
508,IV,of Taipa. The tide was very low and the vessel did not seem far from
509,IV,shore.
510,IV,
511,IV,"The Sampan reached and made fast to the junk, and Adams followed by Dom"
512,IV,Pedro climbed upon the deck.
513,IV,
514,IV,Quick as a flash Adams' arm was seized and bound to his side while Dom
515,IV,"Pedro stepped before him. ""Fool!"" he cried, ""you have stepped into the"
516,IV,"trap with little trouble. It was I who stabbed you, Dom Robert, it was"
517,IV,"I, who took the bride who rightfully belonged to me, as it is I who will"
518,IV,use you for my own good till I may throw you away. You of Northern blood
519,IV,"are fools."""
520,IV,
521,IV,"""I thought you my friend, Dom Pedro, and I thought you a man,"" was the"
522,IV,only reply.
523,IV,
524,IV,"Every appointment of the junk was of exquisite finish, such as is"
525,IV,"seldom seen, and kept scrupulously clean. The men at work on deck, with"
526,IV,"usual Mongolian nonchalance, went about their business without giving"
527,IV,"the least notice to the events occurring. ""The lady Priscilla waits you"
528,IV,"in the cabin,"" said Dom Pedro. ""She knows my plans and though I shall"
529,IV,not intrude upon you I have a Chinese on guard who will kill you if any
530,IV,"attempt is made to free you. Enter."" Adams stepped toward the cabin at"
531,IV,"the stern, where the usual shelf-like arrangements of a junk had been"
532,IV,"transformed into a cabin suited to European taste, with comfort and"
533,IV,luxury. Adams entered and the door was closed. By it stood a guard with
534,IV,drawn sword; in the farther corner sat a woman at a table with her face
535,IV,buried in her hands.
536,IV,
537,IV,"""Robert, as you love me stay where you are. Do not move a step, but sit"
538,IV,"down where you are."" Her voice was so full of pleading that Adams forgot"
539,IV,"his first impulse and obeyed her. ""I know all that has occurred dear"
540,IV,"Robert, your sacrifice and pain and the pain of all my friends during"
541,IV,these sad weeks. Do not move toward me or you will be killed. I will not
542,IV,"look up, dare not look up. On that Sunday, which now seems so long ago,"
543,IV,"when I bid you good-night at the library door, when you and he went to"
544,IV,"the fan-tan house, I followed you with his valet and my maid, for I had"
545,IV,"been fearful of his intentions toward you, and when his valet told me"
546,IV,"that he had seen him secrete a dagger in his coat that morning, and when"
547,IV,"I found one missing from the case, I had my fears confirmed. We followed"
548,IV,and sat in the floor above you and tried to call your attention. When I
549,IV,won at the table at last I put in a warning note and then overturned the
550,IV,"basket. You did not see the paper but he did, and read it. For the rest,"
551,IV,"you were followed at once by him, and we as quickly as possible followed"
552,IV,"both, but only in time to see you fall and to be seized and carried away"
553,IV,"in a closed chair to the yellow house in the Marcos square where, till"
554,IV,"yesterday, I have been confined to the court and inner rooms, with only"
555,IV,my maid as company and a daily visit from him at which I learned the
556,IV,news of your progress toward recovery. Last night we were removed to
557,IV,"this vessel, and I have expected your arrival with hope and fear. His"
558,IV,"idea is to force a marriage with me by threats against your life, or to"
559,IV,sail for Hainan or Formosa and accomplish his designs where law and
560,IV,"justice for us are unknown."""
561,IV,
562,IV,Hurried cries from the deck and a call at the door in Chinese were heard
563,IV,and the guide sheathing his sword rushed from the cabin. In a moment the
564,IV,lovers were together. The bonds which held Adams' arm were cut and
565,IV,"Priscilla pointing to the little window cried, ""Robert, God is with us!"""
566,IV,With his one arm encircling Priscilla they looked from the window.
567,IV,Apparently a strong gale had suddenly sprung up from the south east and
568,IV,rain was falling in torrents; the wind continued to increase though the
569,IV,"rain passed by, but in the distance appeared a dark tower of water"
570,IV,"slowly moving toward Macao, rushing with bending, changing outline from"
571,IV,water to sky. The gale became fiercer and the tumult on deck increased.
572,IV,Immediately from Taipa came the sound of cannon and it was answered by
573,IV,"Macao with her heaviest ordnance as if a battle were raging, and, indeed"
574,IV,"it was a terrible battle, one between man and the elements, but man was"
575,IV,victor and the water spout was broken. The force of the tornado however
576,IV,had yet to reach its climax and for fully five minutes swept over the
577,IV,terrified city and bay with fearful power. Sampans and junks were hurled
578,IV,"like egg-shells upon the shore, where but for the low tide, thousands"
579,IV,instead of hundreds of lives would have been sacrificed. The men-of-war
580,IV,"and the river steamboats did good service, for the course of the"
581,IV,"tornado, was so restricted that though but a hundred yards from its"
582,IV,limit of violence they were untouched. Dom Pedro's junk with others was
583,IV,"torn from its moorings and overturned, but not before Adams and"
584,IV,Priscilla had jumped from the deck. Even in the awful confusion and the
585,IV,terror of the first plunge which carried them below the surface of the
586,IV,"angry waves, she kept her hand clasped upon the empty sleeve of her"
587,IV,recovered protector. Being both good swimmers they assisted each other
588,IV,with that knowledge of the water and the trust which all coast born
589,IV,people have in the mother sea. A boat from one of the war vessels picked
590,IV,them up and in a short time they were both beneath the roof of good Dom
591,IV,"d'Amaral, and rumor with unusual tread, but suited to Macao, slowly"
592,IV,announced the fact of Priscilla's return.
593,IV,
594,IV,"Dom Pedro weak, and with a broken arm, was also carried to the house of"
595,IV,his father and none but the principal actors in the tragedy understood
596,IV,the mystery.
597,IV,
598,IV,"Priscilla had returned in the midst of the tornado, and that was all."
599,IV,The unfortunate young woman was completely prostrated by the terrible
600,IV,experiences through which she had lately passed and lay as if lifeless.
601,IV,"The physicians dreaded an attack of fever would follow, and their worst"
602,IV,fears were realized. Several weeks went by in anxious watching by the
603,IV,sick woman's bedside when at last the fever turned and she gradually
604,IV,grew better. Nothing was said of the occurrences which had brought the
605,IV,"illness about, and Priscilla remembered nothing of them apparently, for"
606,IV,she asked for no one and seemed happy and content to be left with her
607,IV,Chinese _ama_. When she had recovered strength enough to be carried
608,IV,into the court-yard it was with joyful expectancy that Adams went to
609,IV,"greet her, yet his heart sank with sorrow when he saw the marks of the"
610,IV,great suffering in her face and a terrible desire for revenge seized
611,IV,"him, which became the dominant passion of his life."
612,IV,
613,IV,The saddest part of this tale may be given in a few words. Priscilla
614,IV,"Harvey never regained her reason, though she found pleasure in all the"
615,IV,beauties of nature and her life was happy during the two years before
616,IV,her death. Dom Pedro went to Hong Kong and soon disappeared. Robert
617,IV,Adams remained in Macao taking charge of the d'Amaral foreign business.
618,IV,He was the daily companion of the unfortunate Priscilla in all her walks
619,IV,"and it was but a year after her death, when I visited my uncle Robert in"
620,IV,"Macao, when the tragic event occurred which is narrated at the beginning"
621,IV,of this history.
622,IV,
623,IV,My uncle is near my own age and we are more like brothers and have been
624,IV,"together, since the death of Dom Pedro at Camoen's Grotto. The Courts of"
625,IV,Macao exonerated Adams and though the good Dom d'Amaral would willingly
626,IV,"have had him remain in the house at Macao it was not pleasant to think,"
627,IV,"that, even justified as he was, he had killed the only son of his host."
628,IV,
629,IV,It was early in the morning when we left the drowsy city; the sun had
630,IV,"just touched the windows of Sam Januarius, and as the river boat dropped"
631,IV,"into the stream, the church of Our Lady of Guia received its morning"
632,IV,"salutation. The period had come to this story of love and loss, and the"
633,IV,book closed.
634,IV,
635,IV,"Perhaps it is just as well not to work, or play, or read except in ""the"
636,IV,"library of the grasshoppers"" as do my own good, sleeping friends in"
637,IV,Macao.
638,IV,
639,IV,
640,IV,
641,IV,
642,IV,My Sapphire Ring.
643,IV,
644,IV,
645,IV,Where have I seen the sapphire rimmed with gold?
646,IV,"When on the dark blue Carribbean sea,"
647,IV,"Floating at sunset, dreaming lazily,"
648,IV,I saw the God of Day the world enfold;
649,IV,There did my eyes the sapphire rare behold.
650,IV,
651,IV,"I saw the sapphire, when the day was young"
652,IV,"In royal Venice, as I lay and gazed"
653,IV,"Into the morning sky, and saw, amazed,"
654,IV,"Its deep hued brilliance, ere a bird had sung,"
655,IV,Or Matin bells from San Stefano rung.
656,IV,
657,IV,"Once when my course, with myriad sea-flowers strewn,"
658,IV,"Was o'er Formosa's waves of purple dulse,"
659,IV,"Rising and falling like a fevered pulse,"
660,IV,"Moved by the hot and southern born monsoon,"
661,IV,I saw the sapphire glow in tropic noon.
662,IV,
663,IV,"But in our home, beneath our own blue skies,"
664,IV,"Before I knew these treasures of the Earth,"
665,IV,I saw the sapphire of far greater worth--
666,IV,The first born friendship in your boyhood's eyes--
667,IV,Of which this ring as token now I prize.
668,IV,
669,IV,
670,IV,
671,IV,
672,IV,The Hen That Could Lay and Lie.
673,IV,
674,IV,
675,IV,"I had the following story from the bill of an old Spanish hen, an"
676,IV,"inveterate cackler, who used to fly over the neighbouring fence and"
677,IV,"wander, with happy, self-communing clucks about my vegetable garden."
678,IV,
679,IV,"""Yes young man you are young, you may feel bigger than I am, but you are"
680,IV,"not quite so tough, indeed toughness alone has saved me my life for a"
681,IV,"good many Christmas mornings. I am a tough old hen, I have seen the"
682,IV,world; I have traveled. You know the island in the Napa River just above
683,IV,"the railroad bridge? Well, I was wrecked there in my young days and it"
684,IV,happened in this manner.
685,IV,
686,IV,"""The spring of the year 18-- was a wet one; snow fell in the foothills"
687,IV,"and when it melted, the waters rushed down through the ca√±ons and filled"
688,IV,"the river. Our coop, (I say ours as I had a husband then,) stood near"
689,IV,"the bank, and the rising water carried it away. I shall never forget the"
690,IV,"night. It was Billy's last night on earth; Billy was my better half, and"
691,IV,"a handsome, young cock he was, all the young pullets in the yard had"
692,IV,"yellow combs, from envy, the day we were married. Old Partlett with her"
693,IV,"brood of twelve ducks tried her best to get him, but Billy said he"
694,IV,didn't think it was quite the most moral thing in the world for a hen of
695,IV,her age to hatch out ducks and it set a bad example to the young
696,IV,"'broilers' who were growing up about us, so he declined her proposals"
697,IV,"with thanks and sent her off with her ugly-mouthed off-spring. Well, as"
698,IV,"I was saying, our coop was carried down the stream, Billy and I"
699,IV,balancing ourselves on the upper roost and speaking words of comfort to
700,IV,cheer up each other's fast fainting gizzards. We hens have a proverb
701,IV,"which says, 'A life without hope is an egg without a yolk, a gizzard"
702,IV,"without gravel,' and that night proved the words to be true. Suddenly"
703,IV,down went Billy into the roaring flood. I can see his yellow spurs as he
704,IV,"went under, and his clutching claws, those beautiful, shining claws that"
705,IV,"only walked the path of virtue, as far as I knew. Alas how I fluttered,"
706,IV,"I tried to crow for help but it was useless, I could no more do it than"
707,IV,the hens of your genus can whistle. Billy went out forever.
708,IV,
709,IV,"""How I remember his kindness now; how he would find the best worms and"
710,IV,"grasshoppers and always call me to see them before he ate them, not as"
711,IV,"that old beast Cochin China does, who not even lets his wife look at the"
712,IV,delicious morsels he swallows.
713,IV,
714,IV,"""Billy is gone, so I will not regret him for he is probably chief"
715,IV,crower in St. Peter's hennery now. How Peter must blush when he hears
716,IV,"Billy crow, if he has any shame for his past sins. They say St. Peter"
717,IV,has to keep all the dead cocks as a sort of punishment and reminder.
718,IV,
719,IV,"""That night I pulled all the yellow feathers out of my tail, (I have"
720,IV,"Cochin blood in my veins,) and I have gone in black Spanish costume ever"
721,IV,since out of respect for Billy.
722,IV,
723,IV,"""By morning I was cast with the coop upon a deserted island; there was"
724,IV,"nothing but a coarse grass that was eatable, but I was almost dead with"
725,IV,"hunger, and was about giving up in despair when a happy thought struck"
726,IV,"me, and, I laid an egg, which with a little grass made me a good meal."
727,IV,"Each day I laid an egg and ate it, feeling that my life at least could"
728,IV,"be saved, though I must be forever without society, yet I thanked heaven"
729,IV,that hens were made with such resources. Alas! I began to notice that
730,IV,the eggs grew smaller each day and I felt starvation again taking me by
731,IV,"the wattles. To die without friends on a desert island, horrible! Alone!"
732,IV,"Why? Can I not hatch these eggs, can I not raise a brood of little"
733,IV,pullets who shall lay eggs for themselves and me? Time passed and I
734,IV,"brought from the shells eight little chicks, but alas they were all"
735,IV,cocks; poor me. What are they good for on a desert island? They cannot
736,IV,even keep themselves. Perhaps I had thought too much of Billy during the
737,IV,"setting and that influenced the eggs. But my complaint was punished, for"
738,IV,all of the brood were caught one day in the current and carried away.
739,IV,"Poor, little, posthumous chicks, how your father Billy would have loved"
740,IV,you and taught you to crow. Again I tried; this time with more success
741,IV,"and brought from the eggs six little, fluffy pullets. All lived and we"
742,IV,"took turns, off and on, supplying the family with eggs, till one day men"
743,IV,"passing in a row boat, saw us and took us aboard. We had been on the"
744,IV,"island for two months. All my six pullets lived and married, and are now"
745,IV,"in the yard over the fence."""
746,IV,
747,IV,"All this time I had been so interested in the story, that I had not"
748,IV,noticed the narrator who was in the midst of my lettuce bed busily
749,IV,pulling up the young plants.
750,IV,
751,IV,"""Shew there! What are you doing?"" I cried. Off she flew with a cackle of"
752,IV,derision.
753,IV,
754,IV,"Looking after her in astonishment and at my poor lettuce bed, I caught"
755,IV,"the eye of an old turkey, roosting in an apple tree; he was smiling"
