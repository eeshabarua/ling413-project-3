24,VOLUME TWO,
25,VOLUME TWO,Dedicated to the cherished and cheeky peeps.
26,VOLUME TWO,
27,VOLUME TWO,
28,VOLUME TWO,Bravo ! :
29,VOLUME TWO,
30,VOLUME TWO,You speak to one and speak to all
31,VOLUME TWO,Our minds ye have gracefully touched
32,VOLUME TWO,In joy we leap and misery we crawl
33,VOLUME TWO,But in Belief and Faith we have much

36,VOLUME TWO,
37,VOLUME TWO,The '99 Blues (composed in 1999) :
38,VOLUME TWO,
39,VOLUME TWO,Then garrisons marched out to conquer
40,VOLUME TWO,half the world ruled from the center
41,VOLUME TWO,with mastery of steel and agility
42,VOLUME TWO,discipline ensured victory
43,VOLUME TWO,in the reign of conquerors
44,VOLUME TWO,just a few millenniums ago
45,VOLUME TWO,
46,VOLUME TWO,The sea a vast briny divide
47,VOLUME TWO,civilization still ruled by the tide
48,VOLUME TWO,then brave explorers discovered
49,VOLUME TWO,new lands and the people conquered
50,VOLUME TWO,their stake upon immortality
51,VOLUME TWO,for the homeland's glory
52,VOLUME TWO,just a few centuries ago
53,VOLUME TWO,
54,VOLUME TWO,Red flag and sickle brought down a throne
55,VOLUME TWO,when planes first battled and droned
56,VOLUME TWO,world wars twice a century
57,VOLUME TWO,during the first half
58,VOLUME TWO,the Cold War ended
59,VOLUME TWO,just over a decade ago
60,VOLUME TWO,
61,VOLUME TWO,We're not getting closer
62,VOLUME TWO,even as we get older
63,VOLUME TWO,resorted to arms
64,VOLUME TWO,negotiations crumbled
65,VOLUME TWO,talk in shambles
66,VOLUME TWO,just a few years ago
67,VOLUME TWO,
68,VOLUME TWO,News still blaring strife and scandal
69,VOLUME TWO,weight of troubles for the willing and able
70,VOLUME TWO,to cleanse this world of ailments
71,VOLUME TWO,do we seek the new fangled or ancient ?
72,VOLUME TWO,we're still searching
73,VOLUME TWO,just a few days ago
74,VOLUME TWO,
75,VOLUME TWO,Neighbourhood bustles with communal fussing
76,VOLUME TWO,"jobs, relations, children, gossip and bragging"
77,VOLUME TWO,folks I know and don't chattering
78,VOLUME TWO,I have the alcohol's fire in my veins
79,VOLUME TWO,from the drinks I had
80,VOLUME TWO,just a few hours ago
81,VOLUME TWO,
82,VOLUME TWO,My thoughts flip back to friends I had
83,VOLUME TWO,times of delight and mirth made me glad
84,VOLUME TWO,then commitments led us away
85,VOLUME TWO,catch up with you soon
86,VOLUME TWO,I was in the past
87,VOLUME TWO,just a minute ago

91,VOLUME TWO,Passage Of His Reign :
92,VOLUME TWO,
93,VOLUME TWO,Supple youth gambols with fresh breeze.
94,VOLUME TWO,Fledgling seeds sprout first roots.
95,VOLUME TWO,First light flickers from the horizon.
96,VOLUME TWO,Winds  blow with a shrill.
97,VOLUME TWO,His reign is ascending.
98,VOLUME TWO,
99,VOLUME TWO,Seasoned vigour reads the seasons.
100,VOLUME TWO,Roots rush to claim its share of the earth.
101,VOLUME TWO,Torch of day hangs midway at meridian's hour.
102,VOLUME TWO,Winds howl deeply.
103,VOLUME TWO,His reign at its apex.
104,VOLUME TWO,
105,VOLUME TWO,What was once a peak is now a plain.
106,VOLUME TWO,The next crest yields a basin of troughs.
107,VOLUME TWO,Howling winds bewray cracks.
108,VOLUME TWO,
109,VOLUME TWO,Ripe form moves with care.
110,VOLUME TWO,Old roots are gnarled.
111,VOLUME TWO,Light of day  is a humble blend of glow and grey.
112,VOLUME TWO,Winds howl at slurred pace.
113,VOLUME TWO,His reign at its ebb.
114,VOLUME TWO,8>)
115,VOLUME TWO,
116,VOLUME TWO,
117,VOLUME TWO,No. 14 :
118,VOLUME TWO,
119,VOLUME TWO,He's been up and over the hill
120,VOLUME TWO,He's lost the horizon
121,VOLUME TWO,He can't see the end
122,VOLUME TWO,to his plateau limbo
123,VOLUME TWO,
124,VOLUME TWO,The parade of younger generations
125,VOLUME TWO,excite him they do not
126,VOLUME TWO,he knows the game
127,VOLUME TWO,the tools have long changed
128,VOLUME TWO,he a hapless victim
129,VOLUME TWO,of the course of regulations
130,VOLUME TWO,which write off able bodied people
131,VOLUME TWO,on set biological years
132,VOLUME TWO,not on account of physical decline
133,VOLUME TWO,
134,VOLUME TWO,He wastes away
135,VOLUME TWO,He's been up and over the hill
136,VOLUME TWO,Bereft of direction
137,VOLUME TWO,He's lost the horizon
138,VOLUME TWO,which guided previous phases of his life
139,VOLUME TWO,
140,VOLUME TWO,A man in retirement
141,VOLUME TWO,without lifelong passion
142,VOLUME TWO,outside the sphere of his career
143,VOLUME TWO,hastens his own decline
144,VOLUME TWO,He can't see the end
145,VOLUME TWO,to his plateau limbo
146,VOLUME TWO,8>)

148,VOLUME TWO,
149,VOLUME TWO,Worth Of Say :
150,VOLUME TWO,
151,VOLUME TWO,Everybody's worth of say
152,VOLUME TWO,heard in haunts you roam
153,VOLUME TWO,Someone else's worth of say
154,VOLUME TWO,overheard as you flit by
155,VOLUME TWO,It's not your worth of say
156,VOLUME TWO,"while you stand, watch and wait"
157,VOLUME TWO,You want your worth of say
158,VOLUME TWO,before pale flag's hoisted
159,VOLUME TWO,the towel thrown
160,VOLUME TWO,
161,VOLUME TWO,Everybody's worth of say
162,VOLUME TWO,in each twist of rhetoric
163,VOLUME TWO,Someone else's worth of say
164,VOLUME TWO,you cannot see your name
165,VOLUME TWO,It's not your worth of say
166,VOLUME TWO,you haven't spoken yet
167,VOLUME TWO,You want your worth of say
168,VOLUME TWO,before the heart's lost
169,VOLUME TWO,the daredevils retire
170,VOLUME TWO,
171,VOLUME TWO,Everybody's worth of say
172,VOLUME TWO,as you glean the scene
173,VOLUME TWO,Someone else's worth of say
174,VOLUME TWO,while you keep your peace
175,VOLUME TWO,It's not your worth of say
176,VOLUME TWO,when others speak their mind
177,VOLUME TWO,You want your worth of say
178,VOLUME TWO,before the flames flake
179,VOLUME TWO,the embers melt
180,VOLUME TWO,8>)
181,VOLUME TWO,
182,VOLUME TWO,
183,VOLUME TWO,Illustration Of Melancholy:
184,VOLUME TWO,
185,VOLUME TWO,"'I saw your face , It was clouded by smoke"
186,VOLUME TWO,"I grasped the smoke, and inhaled despair"
187,VOLUME TWO,Was I too late ? Am I just in time
188,VOLUME TWO,for one last remorse
189,VOLUME TWO,and to scream myself hoarse
190,VOLUME TWO,robbed of the thrill of a dare
191,VOLUME TWO,The wheels turn with a broken spoke '
192,VOLUME TWO,8>)
193,VOLUME TWO,
194,VOLUME TWO,
195,VOLUME TWO,For A Friend's Recovery :
196,VOLUME TWO,
197,VOLUME TWO,My heart leaps at your recovery
198,VOLUME TWO,Peaks and troughs you did scale
199,VOLUME TWO,Ease towards hearty and hale
200,VOLUME TWO,Soon you'll return to normalcy
201,VOLUME TWO,8>)
202,VOLUME TWO,
203,VOLUME TWO,
204,VOLUME TWO,Progeny :
205,VOLUME TWO,
206,VOLUME TWO,Flesh of one's flesh
207,VOLUME TWO,Blood of one's blood
208,VOLUME TWO,nature and learning mesh
209,VOLUME TWO,where two create a third
210,VOLUME TWO,8>)
211,VOLUME TWO,
212,VOLUME TWO,
213,VOLUME TWO,I'm Leaving :
214,VOLUME TWO,
215,VOLUME TWO,Goodbye there's a pensive stillness
216,VOLUME TWO,A short while to reflect the jolt
217,VOLUME TWO,There's a blithe smile of carelessness
218,VOLUME TWO,A short pause to fasten the bolt
219,VOLUME TWO,8>)
220,VOLUME TWO,
221,VOLUME TWO,
222,VOLUME TWO,Action Required :
223,VOLUME TWO,
224,VOLUME TWO,Thoughts that lodge in me
225,VOLUME TWO,should I bolt them and forget ?
226,VOLUME TWO,should I say them and release ?
227,VOLUME TWO,this quandary baits me
228,VOLUME TWO,with a jerk of regret
229,VOLUME TWO,
230,VOLUME TWO,Questions play within me
231,VOLUME TWO,should I price their logic ?
232,VOLUME TWO,should I leave them be ?
233,VOLUME TWO,this quandary baits me
234,VOLUME TWO,with care I am to pick
235,VOLUME TWO,
236,VOLUME TWO,Resolve swells in me
237,VOLUME TWO,I should heed apprehension !
238,VOLUME TWO,I should calm uncertainty !
239,VOLUME TWO,the last stroke awaits me
240,VOLUME TWO,with an expectation
241,VOLUME TWO,8>)
242,VOLUME TWO,
243,VOLUME TWO,
244,VOLUME TWO,Little One's Hope :
245,VOLUME TWO,
246,VOLUME TWO,Your tiny feet stumble and knees buckle
247,VOLUME TWO,yet you walk with outstretched arms
248,VOLUME TWO,Your hands grapple at awkward angles
249,VOLUME TWO,yet you come with curious arms
250,VOLUME TWO,Child of hope and child of trust
251,VOLUME TWO,Shape your future with our past
252,VOLUME TWO,8>)
253,VOLUME TWO,
254,VOLUME TWO,
255,VOLUME TWO,A Toast To Thee :
256,VOLUME TWO,
257,VOLUME TWO,though the distance for miles swell
258,VOLUME TWO,much from Fortune we can't tell
259,VOLUME TWO,savour rewards and joys we had
260,VOLUME TWO,while sweat and toil made us prepared
261,VOLUME TWO,"your quests ahead, I wish you well"
262,VOLUME TWO,8>)
263,VOLUME TWO,
264,VOLUME TWO,
265,VOLUME TWO,Whimsical Verse :
266,VOLUME TWO,
267,VOLUME TWO,There was a lady of wavy long tresses
268,VOLUME TWO,who pined for short locks of hair
269,VOLUME TWO,so to her wish she one day addresses
270,VOLUME TWO,and was delighted by a sight so fair!
271,VOLUME TWO,8>)
272,VOLUME TWO,
273,VOLUME TWO,
274,VOLUME TWO,A weave of thanks :
275,VOLUME TWO,
276,VOLUME TWO,'twas inspired by inspiration
277,VOLUME TWO,I thank thee for thy plaudit
278,VOLUME TWO,where reason and words meet
279,VOLUME TWO,'tis to me a joyous notion
280,VOLUME TWO,with words Bards shape and weave
281,VOLUME TWO,while from the Muses they receive !
282,VOLUME TWO,8>)
283,VOLUME TWO,
284,VOLUME TWO,
285,VOLUME TWO,Quatrain For Friends :
286,VOLUME TWO,
287,VOLUME TWO,In friendship and in sport
288,VOLUME TWO,Trust and faith scaled the fort
289,VOLUME TWO,In light jest and with truth
290,VOLUME TWO,Hands clasp with regard true
291,VOLUME TWO,8>)
292,VOLUME TWO,
293,VOLUME TWO,
294,VOLUME TWO,The World Turns :
295,VOLUME TWO,
296,VOLUME TWO,for as long as the world turns
297,VOLUME TWO,there'll be cause to go on
298,VOLUME TWO,along its twists and turns
299,VOLUME TWO,from night to new morn
300,VOLUME TWO,sparks alight where fire burns
301,VOLUME TWO,warm embraces and cold spurns
302,VOLUME TWO,events that press us upon
303,VOLUME TWO,when cause and effect churns
304,VOLUME TWO,while hopes and chances spawn
305,VOLUME TWO,sadness and joy have their turns
306,VOLUME TWO,there'll be cause to go on
307,VOLUME TWO,for as long as the world turns
308,VOLUME TWO,8>)
309,VOLUME TWO,
310,VOLUME TWO,
311,VOLUME TWO,Pricey Temptation :
312,VOLUME TWO,
313,VOLUME TWO,Sell us your finest finery
314,VOLUME TWO,To cheer up lively livery
315,VOLUME TWO,the earthly passing passions
316,VOLUME TWO,tempt with comely compulsions
317,VOLUME TWO,8>)
318,VOLUME TWO,
319,VOLUME TWO,
320,VOLUME TWO,Your Move :
321,VOLUME TWO,
322,VOLUME TWO,where does your heart lie ?
323,VOLUME TWO,when it must be true ?
324,VOLUME TWO,the hard questions they pry
325,VOLUME TWO,and they are now due !
326,VOLUME TWO,
327,VOLUME TWO,to salvation where you're cleansed ?
328,VOLUME TWO,or reap damnation of recompense ?
329,VOLUME TWO,judge and make fateful choice
330,VOLUME TWO,foolish plunge or righteous poise !
331,VOLUME TWO,8>)
332,VOLUME TWO,
333,VOLUME TWO,
334,VOLUME TWO,Restless Reckless :
335,VOLUME TWO,
336,VOLUME TWO,Mesh of contradictions
337,VOLUME TWO,with likely predilections
338,VOLUME TWO,flirting with chance
339,VOLUME TWO,in a worldly prance
340,VOLUME TWO,
341,VOLUME TWO,Providence queried with questions varied
342,VOLUME TWO,in a rush hurried of temper unburied
343,VOLUME TWO,
344,VOLUME TWO,Toasts to eventuality
345,VOLUME TWO,with a toss of probability
346,VOLUME TWO,come fame or infamy
347,VOLUME TWO,taunts decreed mortality
348,VOLUME TWO,8>)
349,VOLUME TWO,
350,VOLUME TWO,
351,VOLUME TWO,Three Thoughts at Three Paces :
352,VOLUME TWO,
353,VOLUME TWO,1
354,VOLUME TWO,For what is a lavish bauble
355,VOLUME TWO,but sight to behold and marvel ?
356,VOLUME TWO,It cares not how you fare
357,VOLUME TWO,merely a trinket to compare ?
358,VOLUME TWO,
359,VOLUME TWO,2
360,VOLUME TWO,Mock not the spartan or ornate
361,VOLUME TWO,swiftly in haste or in debate
362,VOLUME TWO,With stealth change alters priorities
363,VOLUME TWO,"makes necessary, luxuries"
364,VOLUME TWO,"makes luxuries, necessities"
365,VOLUME TWO,A restless evolving state
366,VOLUME TWO,fills or wipes a slate
367,VOLUME TWO,
368,VOLUME TWO,3
369,VOLUME TWO,Spare traders of things necessary
370,VOLUME TWO,for their lack of tasteful grace
371,VOLUME TWO,Their use and place have longevity
372,VOLUME TWO,with wares to ease passing days
373,VOLUME TWO,8>)
374,VOLUME TWO,
375,VOLUME TWO,
376,VOLUME TWO,Some Questions(while Hope still waits) :
377,VOLUME TWO,1
378,VOLUME TWO,Will sworn foes swear anew
379,VOLUME TWO,be seated on common pew ?
380,VOLUME TWO,though far easier to renounce strangers
381,VOLUME TWO,bad blood among same blood breeds dangers
382,VOLUME TWO,
383,VOLUME TWO,2
384,VOLUME TWO,Will sworn foes swear anew
385,VOLUME TWO,be seated on common pew ?
386,VOLUME TWO,or will peace be only enforced
387,VOLUME TWO,when each choose a separate course ?
388,VOLUME TWO,
389,VOLUME TWO,3
390,VOLUME TWO,Will sworn foes swear anew
391,VOLUME TWO,be seated on common pew ?
392,VOLUME TWO,or must ill churn till last breath
393,VOLUME TWO,with no certainty but death ?
394,VOLUME TWO,
395,VOLUME TWO,4
396,VOLUME TWO,"By own accord, jettison pride"
397,VOLUME TWO,"Courage on a limb, bare one's hide"
398,VOLUME TWO,If sincerity resides on each side...
399,VOLUME TWO,
400,VOLUME TWO,5
401,VOLUME TWO,Will sworn foes swear anew
402,VOLUME TWO,be seated on common pew ?
403,VOLUME TWO,if oaths can be retaken
404,VOLUME TWO,can they embrace as brethren ?
405,VOLUME TWO,8>)
406,VOLUME TWO,
407,VOLUME TWO,
408,VOLUME TWO,Passing Days :
409,VOLUME TWO,
410,VOLUME TWO,Cry for joy and sorrow
411,VOLUME TWO,Yet lay hope for morrow
412,VOLUME TWO,Lift that blanket over you
413,VOLUME TWO,Till grass is wet with dew
414,VOLUME TWO,Lift your head to a new morn
415,VOLUME TWO,you'll be long way from forlorn
416,VOLUME TWO,greet sunrise with relish
417,VOLUME TWO,bid sunset with a wish
418,VOLUME TWO,8>)
419,VOLUME TWO,
420,VOLUME TWO,
421,VOLUME TWO,A Year Of Changes :
422,VOLUME TWO,
423,VOLUME TWO,A year of welcomes and partings
424,VOLUME TWO,short jaunts and long meanderings
425,VOLUME TWO,of prosaic and verse wanderings
426,VOLUME TWO,sustained efforts and constant dartings
427,VOLUME TWO,
428,VOLUME TWO,A year of comings and goings
429,VOLUME TWO,sure-footed steps and trippings
430,VOLUME TWO,swift stirrings and quiet mullings
431,VOLUME TWO,along known paths and new turnings
432,VOLUME TWO,8>)
433,VOLUME TWO,
434,VOLUME TWO,
435,VOLUME TWO,Another Round(for my friends) :
436,VOLUME TWO,
437,VOLUME TWO,Wishing you joys plenty and setbacks few
438,VOLUME TWO,Like the seasonal changes right on cue
439,VOLUME TWO,Friendship true cloys not but breathes anew
440,VOLUME TWO,Bursting with good faith and goodness due
441,VOLUME TWO,8>)
442,VOLUME TWO,
443,VOLUME TWO,
444,VOLUME TWO,Eight Lines :
445,VOLUME TWO,
446,VOLUME TWO,Things said are said fully
447,VOLUME TWO,Deeds done are done truly
448,VOLUME TWO,There shan't be lies to grieve
449,VOLUME TWO,If truth is like a sieve
450,VOLUME TWO,
451,VOLUME TWO,When wits are matched
452,VOLUME TWO,Our minds are lighted
453,VOLUME TWO,When sins are hatched
454,VOLUME TWO,Our joys are blighted
455,VOLUME TWO,8>)
456,VOLUME TWO,
457,VOLUME TWO,
458,VOLUME TWO,Dose Of Happiness :
459,VOLUME TWO,
460,VOLUME TWO,Feast on meals healthy and hearty
461,VOLUME TWO,moods brightened by fair company
462,VOLUME TWO,amidst weather fine and agreeable
463,VOLUME TWO,chosen activities are feasible
464,VOLUME TWO,with pleasant and peaceful repose
465,VOLUME TWO,awashed with life's joyful dose
466,VOLUME TWO,8>)
467,VOLUME TWO,
468,VOLUME TWO,
469,VOLUME TWO,Under The Influence :
470,VOLUME TWO,
471,VOLUME TWO,Resolute we are to mark treasures
472,VOLUME TWO,with length and breadth of finite measures
473,VOLUME TWO,as if their expanse explains indulgence
474,VOLUME TWO,where passion and devotion fuse at confluence
475,VOLUME TWO,8>)
476,VOLUME TWO,
477,VOLUME TWO,
478,VOLUME TWO,Grant Me A Moment :
479,VOLUME TWO,
480,VOLUME TWO,Grant me a moment its tarrying worth
481,VOLUME TWO,so I may savour my own lingering
482,VOLUME TWO,that later at length I could with mirth
483,VOLUME TWO,dub it a spell apt for remembering
484,VOLUME TWO,8>)
485,VOLUME TWO,
486,VOLUME TWO,
487,VOLUME TWO,The Best Seat :
488,VOLUME TWO,
489,VOLUME TWO,Seated amongst fondest of friends
490,VOLUME TWO,I took my place with much relish
491,VOLUME TWO,there's truth that happiness depends
492,VOLUME TWO,on presence of those we cherish
493,VOLUME TWO,8>)
494,VOLUME TWO,
495,VOLUME TWO,
496,VOLUME TWO,Simple Worship :
497,VOLUME TWO,
498,VOLUME TWO,Elaborate rituals and traditions serve to lengthen the divide between
499,VOLUME TWO,what believers wish to state and supposed obligations that come with
500,VOLUME TWO,"prayers.More often than not, such rituals are man-made rules meant to"
501,VOLUME TWO,"lend mystical, mysterious air to worship. In fact how we worship is as"
502,VOLUME TWO,bare knuckles as simple sincerity.
503,VOLUME TWO,
504,VOLUME TWO,Rituals and traditions do not enhance spiritual health of the
505,VOLUME TWO,faithful.They prolong the physical manifestation of worshipping taken
506,VOLUME TWO,to (at times)zealous and elitist degree. It bewilders those who
507,VOLUME TWO,approach religion with the aim of simple worship and sincere
508,VOLUME TWO,intimations.
509,VOLUME TWO,The imposition of man-made strictures and selfish interpretations
510,VOLUME TWO,magnifies the measure of spiritual desolation and logical confusion
511,VOLUME TWO,when welcome and solace are sought.
512,VOLUME TWO,
513,VOLUME TWO,"It is hurtful and spiritually repulsive to have a monk, priest or"
514,VOLUME TWO,"medium severely chastise a worshipper for menial violations, made out"
515,VOLUME TWO,"of ignorance, for the common people are not as well schooled in"
516,VOLUME TWO,so-called religious conventions. It is their duty to guide and courtesy
517,VOLUME TWO,to instruct. No believer and worshipper comes with willful intent to
518,VOLUME TWO,cause sacrilege. That goes against the purpose and effort of one's
519,VOLUME TWO,"presence. Again, it is caused by the imposition of rituals and ceremony"
520,VOLUME TWO,which causes the divide.
521,VOLUME TWO,
522,VOLUME TWO,"A believer comes, settles in a prayerful pose and speaks one's heart,"
523,VOLUME TWO,"spills worries, mentions cares and wishes hopes for the numerous"
524,VOLUME TWO,tomorrows ahead. It is a simple affirmation of faith and a private
525,VOLUME TWO,conversation with the Maker. What transpires in every session is a
526,VOLUME TWO,mutual secret between believer and Divine. A simple act that can be
527,VOLUME TWO,replicated at home in the confines of the room.
528,VOLUME TWO,8>)
529,VOLUME TWO,
530,VOLUME TWO,
531,VOLUME TWO,Savage Civilization :
532,VOLUME TWO,
533,VOLUME TWO,Known civilization was once overrun by wild tribes. Humanity once again
534,VOLUME TWO,threatens itself; by overrunning itself from within. When decency
535,VOLUME TWO,"becomes an underground outlawed movement, if civilization glorifies its"
536,VOLUME TWO,own demise and luxuriates in the stream of crumbling plaster and
537,VOLUME TWO,"concrete, that is when the very term 'civilization' becomes a"
538,VOLUME TWO,meaningless warble of groans.
539,VOLUME TWO,
540,VOLUME TWO,"Before this desperate nightmare transmutes into hopeless reality, we"
541,VOLUME TWO,need to pinch ourselves and come to our senses by putting our chaotic
542,VOLUME TWO,house in order. We are our own worst enemy and our likeliest saviour.
543,VOLUME TWO,8>)
544,VOLUME TWO,
545,VOLUME TWO,
546,VOLUME TWO,Raindrops :
547,VOLUME TWO,
548,VOLUME TWO,Those who plan to go on foot bide time till lashing water slackens its
549,VOLUME TWO,vehemence upon the earth. Overfed sod forms mud puddles. Drenched
550,VOLUME TWO,concrete turn shades darker.
551,VOLUME TWO,Windows and screens are glazed with hazy film. Droplets streak randomly
552,VOLUME TWO,"along crooked paths, from the steepest incline to the base. Trails of"
553,VOLUME TWO,"clear watery streaks slice through round and oval drops , speedily and"
554,VOLUME TWO,"decisively, like drunken comets."
555,VOLUME TWO,8>)
556,VOLUME TWO,
557,VOLUME TWO,
558,VOLUME TWO,Circumstantial Standpoint :
559,VOLUME TWO,
560,VOLUME TWO,It's nothing but circumstances between us. Circumstances determine who
561,VOLUME TWO,"orders the charge and who charges, who lords over all and who the"
562,VOLUME TWO,"servants are, who rests atop pedestals and who shoulder their weight,"
563,VOLUME TWO,who stands on the rostrum and who stand on the plains.

565,VOLUME TWO,Mere circumstances divide us. They determine who bears the moral
566,VOLUME TWO,"responsibility, who does or refrain from the deed, those who are garbed"
567,VOLUME TWO,"and crowned with honour , those besmirched with infamy."
568,VOLUME TWO,
569,VOLUME TWO,It's nothing but circumstances between us. Their plot is such that
570,VOLUME TWO,"there are those who are heralds, those who are heralded and those who"
571,VOLUME TWO,are unheralded masses. Mere circumstances stretch and fill
572,VOLUME TWO,possibilities within the circumstantial spectrum.

576,VOLUME TWO,Just Passing By :
577,VOLUME TWO,
578,VOLUME TWO,Questions and reality of mortality meet us head on. They are
579,VOLUME TWO,inescapable in this mortal sphere. With each experience we grow towards
580,VOLUME TWO,maturity and acceptance of the frailties of the flesh in Life's autumn.
581,VOLUME TWO,Mortality steps on our plate. It comes with mounting frequency. Rising
582,VOLUME TWO,"generations. Receding elders. They meet , then one of them become"
583,VOLUME TWO,recollection.

587,VOLUME TWO,Workers Of The Land :
588,VOLUME TWO,
589,VOLUME TWO,Let's turn our plaudits from urbane beings to workers of the land. Ever
590,VOLUME TWO,so often overlooked in this age of metropolis. Their handiwork beget
591,VOLUME TWO,sustenance which we require to sustain life and maintain our well being.
592,VOLUME TWO,"The country's produce douses bothers of hunger, satiates palates. Their"
593,VOLUME TWO,"bread and butter , our bread and butter."
594,VOLUME TWO,"Workers of the land, at times contemned, dismissed as simpletons. Give"
595,VOLUME TWO,them their due. Short change them not with regard. The earth had been
596,VOLUME TWO,"generous to them when our tongues were miserly. Workers of the land,"
597,VOLUME TWO,nurtured by the earth and they nurture the earth in return for its
598,VOLUME TWO,gifts.

602,VOLUME TWO,Rest :
603,VOLUME TWO,
604,VOLUME TWO,Sleep is relief between exertions and effort we demand from ourselves.
605,VOLUME TWO,"Much as we crave to eject all stops , the flesh craves due rest. The"
606,VOLUME TWO,sword misses its scabbard. It returns to its housing when warlike
607,VOLUME TWO,vigilance is out of place. Take rest when your being needs its
608,VOLUME TWO,nourishment. Resume your affairs when refreshed. Thoughts dart. Senses
609,VOLUME TWO,sharpened. Limbs have their nimbleness returned. Go fly into the arena.
610,VOLUME TWO,"Spend strength inside. When weariness gives the cue, come right back to"
611,VOLUME TWO,the lull of repose.

616,VOLUME TWO,
617,VOLUME TWO,The time we had. Life's delights shared. Repartees. Jousting with and
618,VOLUME TWO,jocular bandying. They take stage and fill gaps during bouts of
619,VOLUME TWO,"excruciating inactivity. Scene, scents and discerned details. Moments"
620,VOLUME TWO,of climax. Instances at the apex of tension which left all ahanging on
621,VOLUME TWO,every second of charged anticipation relieved by laughter when the
622,VOLUME TWO,"punch line was delivered. Unexpected turns, surprise when it caught us"
623,VOLUME TWO,"at the tender flank, we were stupefied. Then senses roused us to cheer"
624,VOLUME TWO,the deftness of the deed.
