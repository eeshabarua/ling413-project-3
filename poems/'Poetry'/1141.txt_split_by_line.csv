60,PREFACE,
61,PREFACE,IT is thought that a selection from Oscar Wilde’s early verses may be of
62,PREFACE,interest to a large public at present familiar only with the always
63,PREFACE,"popular _Ballad of Reading Gaol_, also included in this volume.  The"
64,PREFACE,poems were first collected by their author when he was twenty-sex years
65,PREFACE,"old, and though never, until recently, well received by the critics, have"
66,PREFACE,survived the test of NINE editions.  Readers will be able to make for
67,PREFACE,themselves the obvious and striking contrasts between these first and
68,PREFACE,last phases of Oscar Wilde’s literary activity.  The intervening period
69,PREFACE,"was devoted almost entirely to dramas, prose, fiction, essays, and"
70,PREFACE,criticism.

137,I,I
138,I,
139,I,"HE did not wear his scarlet coat,"
140,I,"For blood and wine are red,"
141,I,And blood and wine were on his hands
142,I,"When they found him with the dead,"
143,I,"The poor dead woman whom he loved,"
144,I,And murdered in her bed.
145,I,
146,I,He walked amongst the Trial Men
147,I,In a suit of shabby grey;
148,I,"A cricket cap was on his head,"
149,I,And his step seemed light and gay;
150,I,But I never saw a man who looked
151,I,So wistfully at the day.
152,I,
153,I,I never saw a man who looked
154,I,With such a wistful eye
155,I,Upon that little tent of blue
156,I,"Which prisoners call the sky,"
157,I,And at every drifting cloud that went
158,I,With sails of silver by.
159,I,
160,I,"I walked, with other souls in pain,"
161,I,"Within another ring,"
162,I,And was wondering if the man had done
163,I,"A great or little thing,"
164,I,"When a voice behind me whispered low,"
165,I,‘_That fellow’s got to swing_.’
166,I,
167,I,Dear Christ! the very prison walls
168,I,"Suddenly seemed to reel,"
169,I,And the sky above my head became
170,I,Like a casque of scorching steel;
171,I,"And, though I was a soul in pain,"
172,I,My pain I could not feel.
173,I,
174,I,I only knew what hunted thought
175,I,"Quickened his step, and why"
176,I,He looked upon the garish day
177,I,With such a wistful eye;
178,I,"The man had killed the thing he loved,"
179,I,And so he had to die.
180,I,
181,I,"Yet each man kills the thing he loves,"
182,I,"By each let this be heard,"
183,I,"Some do it with a bitter look,"
184,I,"Some with a flattering word,"
185,I,"The coward does it with a kiss,"
186,I,The brave man with a sword!
187,I,
188,I,"Some kill their love when they are young,"
189,I,And some when they are old;
190,I,"Some strangle with the hands of Lust,"
191,I,Some with the hands of Gold:
192,I,"The kindest use a knife, because"
193,I,The dead so soon grow cold.
194,I,
195,I,"Some love too little, some too long,"
196,I,"Some sell, and others buy;"
197,I,"Some do the deed with many tears,"
198,I,And some without a sigh:
199,I,"For each man kills the thing he loves,"
200,I,Yet each man does not die.
201,I,
202,I,He does not die a death of shame
203,I,"On a day of dark disgrace,"
204,I,"Nor have a noose about his neck,"
205,I,"Nor a cloth upon his face,"
206,I,Nor drop feet foremost through the floor
207,I,Into an empty space.
208,I,
209,I,He does not sit with silent men
210,I,Who watch him night and day;
211,I,"Who watch him when he tries to weep,"
212,I,And when he tries to pray;
213,I,Who watch him lest himself should rob
214,I,The prison of its prey.
215,I,
216,I,He does not wake at dawn to see
217,I,"Dread figures throng his room,"
218,I,"The shivering Chaplain robed in white,"
219,I,"The Sheriff stern with gloom,"
220,I,"And the Governor all in shiny black,"
221,I,With the yellow face of Doom.
222,I,
223,I,He does not rise in piteous haste
224,I,"To put on convict-clothes,"
225,I,"While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes"
226,I,"Each new and nerve-twitched pose,"
227,I,Fingering a watch whose little ticks
228,I,Are like horrible hammer-blows.
229,I,
230,I,He does not know that sickening thirst
231,I,"That sands one’s throat, before"
232,I,The hangman with his gardener’s gloves
233,I,"Slips through the padded door,"
234,I,"And binds one with three leathern thongs,"
235,I,That the throat may thirst no more.
236,I,
237,I,He does not bend his head to hear
238,I,"The Burial Office read,"
239,I,"Nor, while the terror of his soul"
240,I,"Tells him he is not dead,"
241,I,"Cross his own coffin, as he moves"
242,I,Into the hideous shed.
243,I,
244,I,He does not stare upon the air
245,I,Through a little roof of glass:
246,I,He does not pray with lips of clay
247,I,For his agony to pass;
248,I,Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek
249,I,The kiss of Caiaphas.
250,I,
251,II,II
252,II,
253,II,"SIX weeks our guardsman walked the yard,"
254,II,In the suit of shabby grey:
255,II,"His cricket cap was on his head,"
256,II,"And his step seemed light and gay,"
257,II,But I never saw a man who looked
258,II,So wistfully at the day.
259,II,
260,II,I never saw a man who looked
261,II,With such a wistful eye
262,II,Upon that little tent of blue
263,II,"Which prisoners call the sky,"
264,II,And at every wandering cloud that trailed
265,II,Its ravelled fleeces by.
266,II,
267,II,"He did not wring his hands, as do"
268,II,Those witless men who dare
269,II,To try to rear the changeling Hope
270,II,In the cave of black Despair:
271,II,"He only looked upon the sun,"
272,II,And drank the morning air.
273,II,
274,II,"He did not wring his hands nor weep,"
275,II,"Nor did he peek or pine,"
276,II,But he drank the air as though it held
277,II,Some healthful anodyne;
278,II,With open mouth he drank the sun
279,II,As though it had been wine!
280,II,
281,II,"And I and all the souls in pain,"
282,II,"Who tramped the other ring,"
283,II,Forgot if we ourselves had done
284,II,"A great or little thing,"
285,II,And watched with gaze of dull amaze
286,II,The man who had to swing.
287,II,
288,II,And strange it was to see him pass
289,II,"With a step so light and gay,"
290,II,And strange it was to see him look
291,II,"So wistfully at the day,"
292,II,And strange it was to think that he
293,II,Had such a debt to pay.
294,II,
295,II,For oak and elm have pleasant leaves
296,II,That in the springtime shoot:
297,II,"But grim to see is the gallows-tree,"
298,II,"With its adder-bitten root,"
299,II,"And, green or dry, a man must die"
300,II,Before it bears its fruit!
301,II,
302,II,The loftiest place is that seat of grace
303,II,For which all worldlings try:
304,II,But who would stand in hempen band
305,II,"Upon a scaffold high,"
306,II,And through a murderer’s collar take
307,II,His last look at the sky?
308,II,
309,II,It is sweet to dance to violins
310,II,When Love and Life are fair:
311,II,"To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes"
312,II,Is delicate and rare:
313,II,But it is not sweet with nimble feet
314,II,To dance upon the air!
315,II,
316,II,So with curious eyes and sick surmise
317,II,"We watched him day by day,"
318,II,And wondered if each one of us
319,II,"Would end the self-same way,"
320,II,For none can tell to what red Hell
321,II,His sightless soul may stray.
322,II,
323,II,At last the dead man walked no more
324,II,"Amongst the Trial Men,"
325,II,And I knew that he was standing up
326,II,"In the black dock’s dreadful pen,"
327,II,And that never would I see his face
328,II,In God’s sweet world again.
329,II,
330,II,Like two doomed ships that pass in storm
331,II,We had crossed each other’s way:
332,II,"But we made no sign, we said no word,"
333,II,We had no word to say;
334,II,"For we did not meet in the holy night,"
335,II,But in the shameful day.
336,II,
337,II,"A prison wall was round us both,"
338,II,Two outcast men we were:
339,II,"The world had thrust us from its heart,"
340,II,And God from out His care:
341,II,And the iron gin that waits for Sin
342,II,Had caught us in its snare.
343,II,
344,III,III
345,III,
346,III,"IN Debtors’ Yard the stones are hard,"
347,III,"And the dripping wall is high,"
348,III,So it was there he took the air
349,III,"Beneath the leaden sky,"
350,III,"And by each side a Warder walked,"
351,III,For fear the man might die.
352,III,
353,III,Or else he sat with those who watched
354,III,His anguish night and day;
355,III,"Who watched him when he rose to weep,"
356,III,And when he crouched to pray;
357,III,Who watched him lest himself should rob
358,III,Their scaffold of its prey.
359,III,
360,III,The Governor was strong upon
361,III,The Regulations Act:
362,III,The Doctor said that Death was but
363,III,A scientific fact:
364,III,"And twice a day the Chaplain called,"
365,III,And left a little tract.
366,III,
367,III,"And twice a day he smoked his pipe,"
368,III,And drank his quart of beer:
369,III,"His soul was resolute, and held"
370,III,No hiding-place for fear;
371,III,He often said that he was glad
372,III,The hangman’s hands were near.
373,III,
374,III,But why he said so strange a thing
375,III,No Warder dared to ask:
376,III,For he to whom a watcher’s doom
377,III,"Is given as his task,"
378,III,"Must set a lock upon his lips,"
379,III,And make his face a mask.
380,III,
381,III,"Or else he might be moved, and try"
382,III,To comfort or console:
383,III,And what should Human Pity do
384,III,Pent up in Murderers’ Hole?
385,III,What word of grace in such a place
386,III,Could help a brother’s soul?
387,III,
388,III,With slouch and swing around the ring
389,III,We trod the Fools’ Parade!
390,III,We did not care: we knew we were
391,III,The Devil’s Own Brigade:
392,III,And shaven head and feet of lead
393,III,Make a merry masquerade.
394,III,
395,III,We tore the tarry rope to shreds
396,III,With blunt and bleeding nails;
397,III,"We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,"
398,III,And cleaned the shining rails:
399,III,"And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,"
400,III,And clattered with the pails.
401,III,
402,III,"We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,"
403,III,We turned the dusty drill:
404,III,"We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,"
405,III,And sweated on the mill:
406,III,But in the heart of every man
407,III,Terror was lying still.
408,III,
409,III,So still it lay that every day
410,III,Crawled like a weed-clogged wave:
411,III,And we forgot the bitter lot
412,III,"That waits for fool and knave,"
413,III,"Till once, as we tramped in from work,"
414,III,We passed an open grave.
415,III,
416,III,With yawning mouth the yellow hole
417,III,Gaped for a living thing;
418,III,The very mud cried out for blood
419,III,To the thirsty asphalte ring:
420,III,And we knew that ere one dawn grew fair
421,III,Some prisoner had to swing.
422,III,
423,III,"Right in we went, with soul intent"
424,III,On Death and Dread and Doom:
425,III,"The hangman, with his little bag,"
426,III,Went shuffling through the gloom:
427,III,And each man trembled as he crept
428,III,Into his numbered tomb.
429,III,
430,III,That night the empty corridors
431,III,"Were full of forms of Fear,"
432,III,And up and down the iron town
433,III,"Stole feet we could not hear,"
434,III,And through the bars that hide the stars
435,III,White faces seemed to peer.
436,III,
437,III,He lay as one who lies and dreams
438,III,"In a pleasant meadow-land,"
439,III,"The watchers watched him as he slept,"
440,III,And could not understand
441,III,How one could sleep so sweet a sleep
442,III,With a hangman close at hand.
443,III,
444,III,But there is no sleep when men must weep
445,III,Who never yet have wept:
446,III,"So we—the fool, the fraud, the knave—"
447,III,"That endless vigil kept,"
448,III,And through each brain on hands of pain
449,III,Another’s terror crept.
450,III,
451,III,Alas! it is a fearful thing
452,III,To feel another’s guilt!
453,III,"For, right within, the sword of Sin"
454,III,"Pierced to its poisoned hilt,"
455,III,And as molten lead were the tears we shed
456,III,For the blood we had not spilt.
457,III,
458,III,The Warders with their shoes of felt
459,III,"Crept by each padlocked door,"
460,III,"And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,"
461,III,"Grey figures on the floor,"
462,III,And wondered why men knelt to pray
463,III,Who never prayed before.
464,III,
465,III,"All through the night we knelt and prayed,"
466,III,Mad mourners of a corse!
467,III,The troubled plumes of midnight were
468,III,The plumes upon a hearse:
469,III,And bitter wine upon a sponge
470,III,Was the savour of Remorse.
471,III,
472,III,"The grey cock crew, the red cock crew,"
473,III,But never came the day:
474,III,"And crooked shapes of Terror crouched,"
475,III,In the corners where we lay:
476,III,And each evil sprite that walks by night
477,III,Before us seemed to play.
478,III,
479,III,"They glided past, they glided fast,"
480,III,Like travellers through a mist:
481,III,They mocked the moon in a rigadoon
482,III,"Of delicate turn and twist,"
483,III,And with formal pace and loathsome grace
484,III,The phantoms kept their tryst.
485,III,
486,III,"With mop and mow, we saw them go,"
487,III,Slim shadows hand in hand:
488,III,"About, about, in ghostly rout"
489,III,They trod a saraband:
490,III,"And the damned grotesques made arabesques,"
491,III,Like the wind upon the sand!
492,III,
493,III,"With the pirouettes of marionettes,"
494,III,They tripped on pointed tread:
495,III,"But with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,"
496,III,"As their grisly masque they led,"
497,III,"And loud they sang, and long they sang,"
498,III,For they sang to wake the dead.
499,III,
500,III,"‘Oho!’ they cried, ‘The world is wide,"
501,III,But fettered limbs go lame!
502,III,"And once, or twice, to throw the dice"
503,III,"Is a gentlemanly game,"
504,III,But he does not win who plays with Sin
505,III,In the secret House of Shame.’
506,III,
507,III,"No things of air these antics were,"
508,III,That frolicked with such glee:
509,III,"To men whose lives were held in gyves,"
510,III,"And whose feet might not go free,"
511,III,"Ah! wounds of Christ! they were living things,"
512,III,Most terrible to see.
513,III,
514,III,"Around, around, they waltzed and wound;"
515,III,Some wheeled in smirking pairs;
516,III,With the mincing step of a demirep
517,III,Some sidled up the stairs:
518,III,"And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,"
519,III,Each helped us at our prayers.
520,III,
521,III,"The morning wind began to moan,"
522,III,But still the night went on:
523,III,Through its giant loom the web of gloom
524,III,Crept till each thread was spun:
525,III,"And, as we prayed, we grew afraid"
526,III,Of the Justice of the Sun.
527,III,
528,III,The moaning wind went wandering round
529,III,The weeping prison-wall:
530,III,Till like a wheel of turning steel
531,III,We felt the minutes crawl:
532,III,O moaning wind! what had we done
533,III,To have such a seneschal?
534,III,
535,III,"At last I saw the shadowed bars,"
536,III,"Like a lattice wrought in lead,"
537,III,Move right across the whitewashed wall
538,III,"That faced my three-plank bed,"
539,III,And I knew that somewhere in the world
540,III,God’s dreadful dawn was red.
541,III,
542,III,"At six o’clock we cleaned our cells,"
543,III,"At seven all was still,"
544,III,But the sough and swing of a mighty wing
545,III,"The prison seemed to fill,"
546,III,For the Lord of Death with icy breath
547,III,Had entered in to kill.
548,III,
549,III,"He did not pass in purple pomp,"
550,III,Nor ride a moon-white steed.
551,III,Three yards of cord and a sliding board
552,III,Are all the gallows’ need:
553,III,So with rope of shame the Herald came
554,III,To do the secret deed.
555,III,
556,III,We were as men who through a fen
557,III,Of filthy darkness grope:
558,III,"We did not dare to breathe a prayer,"
559,III,Or to give our anguish scope:
560,III,"Something was dead in each of us,"
561,III,And what was dead was Hope.
562,III,
563,III,"For Man’s grim Justice goes its way,"
564,III,And will not swerve aside:
565,III,"It slays the weak, it slays the strong,"
566,III,It has a deadly stride:
567,III,"With iron heel it slays the strong,"
568,III,The monstrous parricide!
569,III,
570,III,We waited for the stroke of eight:
571,III,Each tongue was thick with thirst:
572,III,For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate
573,III,"That makes a man accursed,"
574,III,And Fate will use a running noose
575,III,For the best man and the worst.
576,III,
577,III,"We had no other thing to do,"
578,III,Save to wait for the sign to come:
579,III,"So, like things of stone in a valley lone,"
580,III,Quiet we sat and dumb:
581,III,"But each man’s heart beat thick and quick,"
582,III,Like a madman on a drum!
583,III,
584,III,With sudden shock the prison-clock
585,III,"Smote on the shivering air,"
586,III,And from all the gaol rose up a wail
587,III,"Of impotent despair,"
588,III,Like the sound that frightened marshes hear
589,III,From some leper in his lair.
590,III,
591,III,And as one sees most fearful things
592,III,"In the crystal of a dream,"
593,III,We saw the greasy hempen rope
594,III,"Hooked to the blackened beam,"
595,III,And heard the prayer the hangman’s snare
596,III,Strangled into a scream.
597,III,
598,III,And all the woe that moved him so
599,III,"That he gave that bitter cry,"
600,III,"And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,"
601,III,None knew so well as I:
602,III,For he who lives more lives than one
603,III,More deaths than one must die.
604,III,
605,IV,IV
606,IV,
607,IV,THERE is no chapel on the day
608,IV,On which they hang a man:
609,IV,"The Chaplain’s heart is far too sick,"
610,IV,"Or his face is far too wan,"
611,IV,Or there is that written in his eyes
612,IV,Which none should look upon.
613,IV,
614,IV,"So they kept us close till nigh on noon,"
615,IV,"And then they rang the bell,"
616,IV,And the Warders with their jingling keys
617,IV,"Opened each listening cell,"
618,IV,"And down the iron stair we tramped,"
619,IV,Each from his separate Hell.
620,IV,
621,IV,"Out into God’s sweet air we went,"
622,IV,"But not in wonted way,"
623,IV,"For this man’s face was white with fear,"
624,IV,"And that man’s face was grey,"
625,IV,And I never saw sad men who looked
626,IV,So wistfully at the day.
627,IV,
628,IV,I never saw sad men who looked
629,IV,With such a wistful eye
630,IV,Upon that little tent of blue
631,IV,"We prisoners called the sky,"
632,IV,And at every careless cloud that passed
633,IV,In happy freedom by.
634,IV,
635,IV,But there were those amongst us all
636,IV,"Who walked with downcast head,"
637,IV,"And knew that, had each got his due,"
638,IV,They should have died instead:
639,IV,"He had but killed a thing that lived,"
640,IV,Whilst they had killed the dead.
641,IV,
642,IV,For he who sins a second time
643,IV,"Wakes a dead soul to pain,"
644,IV,"And draws it from its spotted shroud,"
645,IV,"And makes it bleed again,"
646,IV,"And makes it bleed great gouts of blood,"
647,IV,And makes it bleed in vain!
648,IV,
649,IV,"Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb"
650,IV,"With crooked arrows starred,"
651,IV,Silently we went round and round
652,IV,The slippery asphalte yard;
653,IV,"Silently we went round and round,"
654,IV,And no man spoke a word.
655,IV,
656,IV,"Silently we went round and round,"
657,IV,And through each hollow mind
658,IV,The Memory of dreadful things
659,IV,"Rushed like a dreadful wind,"
660,IV,"And Horror stalked before each man,"
661,IV,And Terror crept behind.
662,IV,
663,IV,"The Warders strutted up and down,"
664,IV,"And kept their herd of brutes,"
665,IV,"Their uniforms were spick and span,"
666,IV,"And they wore their Sunday suits,"
667,IV,"But we knew the work they had been at,"
668,IV,By the quicklime on their boots.
669,IV,
670,IV,"For where a grave had opened wide,"
671,IV,There was no grave at all:
672,IV,Only a stretch of mud and sand
673,IV,"By the hideous prison-wall,"
674,IV,"And a little heap of burning lime,"
675,IV,That the man should have his pall.
676,IV,
677,IV,"For he has a pall, this wretched man,"
678,IV,Such as few men can claim:
679,IV,"Deep down below a prison-yard,"
680,IV,"Naked for greater shame,"
681,IV,"He lies, with fetters on each foot,"
682,IV,Wrapt in a sheet of flame!
683,IV,
684,IV,And all the while the burning lime
685,IV,"Eats flesh and bone away,"
686,IV,"It eats the brittle bone by night,"
687,IV,"And the soft flesh by day,"
688,IV,"It eats the flesh and bone by turns,"
689,IV,But it eats the heart alway.
690,IV,
691,IV,For three long years they will not sow
692,IV,Or root or seedling there:
693,IV,For three long years the unblessed spot
694,IV,"Will sterile be and bare,"
695,IV,And look upon the wondering sky
696,IV,With unreproachful stare.
697,IV,
698,IV,They think a murderer’s heart would taint
699,IV,Each simple seed they sow.
700,IV,It is not true!  God’s kindly earth
701,IV,"Is kindlier than men know,"
702,IV,"And the red rose would but blow more red,"
703,IV,The white rose whiter blow.
704,IV,
705,IV,"Out of his mouth a red, red rose!"
706,IV,Out of his heart a white!
707,IV,"For who can say by what strange way,"
708,IV,"Christ brings His will to light,"
709,IV,Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore
710,IV,Bloomed in the great Pope’s sight?
711,IV,
712,IV,But neither milk-white rose nor red
713,IV,May bloom in prison-air;
714,IV,"The shard, the pebble, and the flint,"
715,IV,Are what they give us there:
716,IV,For flowers have been known to heal
717,IV,A common man’s despair.
718,IV,
719,IV,"So never will wine-red rose or white,"
720,IV,"Petal by petal, fall"
721,IV,On that stretch of mud and sand that lies
722,IV,"By the hideous prison-wall,"
723,IV,To tell the men who tramp the yard
724,IV,That God’s Son died for all.
725,IV,
726,IV,Yet though the hideous prison-wall
727,IV,"Still hems him round and round,"
728,IV,And a spirit may not walk by night
729,IV,"That is with fetters bound,"
730,IV,And a spirit may but weep that lies
731,IV,"In such unholy ground,"
732,IV,
733,IV,He is at peace—this wretched man—
734,IV,"At peace, or will be soon:"
735,IV,"There is no thing to make him mad,"
736,IV,"Nor does Terror walk at noon,"
737,IV,For the lampless Earth in which he lies
738,IV,Has neither Sun nor Moon.
739,IV,
740,IV,They hanged him as a beast is hanged:
741,IV,They did not even toll
742,IV,A requiem that might have brought
743,IV,"Rest to his startled soul,"
744,IV,"But hurriedly they took him out,"
745,IV,And hid him in a hole.
746,IV,
747,IV,"They stripped him of his canvas clothes,"
748,IV,And gave him to the flies:
749,IV,"They mocked the swollen purple throat,"
750,IV,And the stark and staring eyes:
751,IV,And with laughter loud they heaped the shroud
752,IV,In which their convict lies.
753,IV,
754,IV,The Chaplain would not kneel to pray
755,IV,By his dishonoured grave:
756,IV,Nor mark it with that blessed Cross
757,IV,"That Christ for sinners gave,"
758,IV,Because the man was one of those
759,IV,Whom Christ came down to save.
760,IV,
761,IV,Yet all is well; he has but passed
762,IV,To Life’s appointed bourne:
763,IV,And alien tears will fill for him
764,IV,"Pity’s long-broken urn,"
765,IV,"For his mourners will be outcast men,"
766,IV,And outcasts always mourn
767,IV,
768,V,V
769,V,
770,V,"I KNOW not whether Laws be right,"
771,V,Or whether Laws be wrong;
772,V,All that we know who lie in gaol
773,V,Is that the wall is strong;
774,V,"And that each day is like a year,"
775,V,A year whose days are long.
776,V,
777,V,"But this I know, that every Law"
778,V,"That men have made for Man,"
779,V,"Since first Man took his brother’s life,"
780,V,"And the sad world began,"
781,V,But straws the wheat and saves the chaff
782,V,With a most evil fan.
783,V,
784,V,This too I know—and wise it were
785,V,If each could know the same—
786,V,That every prison that men build
787,V,"Is built with bricks of shame,"
788,V,And bound with bars lest Christ should see
789,V,How men their brothers maim.
790,V,
791,V,"With bars they blur the gracious moon,"
792,V,And blind the goodly sun:
793,V,"And they do well to hide their Hell,"
794,V,For in it things are done
795,V,That Son of God nor son of Man
796,V,Ever should look upon!
797,V,
798,V,"The vilest deeds like poison weeds,"
799,V,Bloom well in prison-air;
800,V,It is only what is good in Man
801,V,That wastes and withers there:
802,V,"Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,"
803,V,And the Warder is Despair.
804,V,
805,V,For they starve the little frightened child
806,V,Till it weeps both night and day:
807,V,"And they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,"
808,V,"And gibe the old and grey,"
809,V,"And some grow mad, and all grow bad,"
810,V,And none a word may say.
811,V,
812,V,Each narrow cell in which we dwell
813,V,"Is a foul and dark latrine,"
814,V,And the fetid breath of living Death
815,V,"Chokes up each grated screen,"
816,V,"And all, but Lust, is turned to dust"
817,V,In Humanity’s machine.
818,V,
819,V,The brackish water that we drink
820,V,"Creeps with a loathsome slime,"
821,V,And the bitter bread they weigh in scales
822,V,"Is full of chalk and lime,"
823,V,"And Sleep will not lie down, but walks"
824,V,"Wild-eyed, and cries to Time."
825,V,
826,V,But though lean Hunger and green Thirst
827,V,"Like asp with adder fight,"
828,V,"We have little care of prison fare,"
829,V,For what chills and kills outright
830,V,Is that every stone one lifts by day
831,V,Becomes one’s heart by night.
832,V,
833,V,"With midnight always in one’s heart,"
834,V,"And twilight in one’s cell,"
835,V,"We turn the crank, or tear the rope,"
836,V,"Each in his separate Hell,"
837,V,And the silence is more awful far
838,V,Than the sound of a brazen bell.
839,V,
840,V,And never a human voice comes near
841,V,To speak a gentle word:
842,V,And the eye that watches through the door
843,V,Is pitiless and hard:
844,V,"And by all forgot, we rot and rot,"
845,V,With soul and body marred.
846,V,
847,V,And thus we rust Life’s iron chain
848,V,Degraded and alone:
849,V,"And some men curse, and some men weep,"
850,V,And some men make no moan:
851,V,But God’s eternal Laws are kind
852,V,And break the heart of stone.
853,V,
854,V,"And every human heart that breaks,"
855,V,"In prison-cell or yard,"
856,V,Is as that broken box that gave
857,V,"Its treasure to the Lord,"
858,V,And filled the unclean leper’s house
859,V,With the scent of costliest nard.
860,V,
861,V,Ah! happy they whose hearts can break
862,V,And peace of pardon win!
863,V,How else may man make straight his plan
864,V,And cleanse his soul from Sin?
865,V,How else but through a broken heart
866,V,May Lord Christ enter in?
867,V,
868,V,"And he of the swollen purple throat,"
869,V,"And the stark and staring eyes,"
870,V,Waits for the holy hands that took
871,V,The Thief to Paradise;
872,V,And a broken and a contrite heart
873,V,The Lord will not despise.
874,V,
875,V,The man in red who reads the Law
876,V,"Gave him three weeks of life,"
877,V,Three little weeks in which to heal
878,V,"His soul of his soul’s strife,"
879,V,And cleanse from every blot of blood
880,V,The hand that held the knife.
881,V,
882,V,"And with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,"
883,V,The hand that held the steel:
884,V,"For only blood can wipe out blood,"
885,V,And only tears can heal:
886,V,And the crimson stain that was of Cain
887,V,Became Christ’s snow-white seal.
888,V,
889,VI,VI
890,VI,
891,VI,IN Reading gaol by Reading town
892,VI,"There is a pit of shame,"
893,VI,And in it lies a wretched man
894,VI,"Eaten by teeth of flame,"
895,VI,"In a burning winding-sheet he lies,"
896,VI,And his grave has got no name.
897,VI,
898,VI,"And there, till Christ call forth the dead,"
899,VI,In silence let him lie:
900,VI,"No need to waste the foolish tear,"
901,VI,Or heave the windy sigh:
902,VI,"The man had killed the thing he loved,"
903,VI,And so he had to die.
904,VI,
905,VI,"And all men kill the thing they love,"
906,VI,"By all let this be heard,"
907,VI,"Some do it with a bitter look,"
908,VI,"Some with a flattering word,"
909,VI,"The coward does it with a kiss,"
910,VI,The brave man with a sword!

922,I,"HE did not wear his scarlet coat,"
923,I,"For blood and wine are red,"
924,I,And blood and wine were on his hands
925,I,"When they found him with the dead,"
926,I,"The poor dead woman whom he loved,"
927,I,And murdered in her bed.
928,I,
929,I,He walked amongst the Trial Men
930,I,In a suit of shabby grey;
931,I,"A cricket cap was on his head,"
932,I,And his step seemed light and gay;
933,I,But I never saw a man who looked
934,I,So wistfully at the day.
935,I,
936,I,I never saw a man who looked
937,I,With such a wistful eye
938,I,Upon that little tent of blue
939,I,"Which prisoners call the sky,"
940,I,And at every drifting cloud that went
941,I,With sails of silver by.
942,I,
943,I,"I walked, with other souls in pain,"
944,I,"Within another ring,"
945,I,And was wondering if the man had done
946,I,"A great or little thing,"
947,I,"When a voice behind me whispered low,"
948,I,‘_That fellow’s got to swing_.’
949,I,
950,I,Dear Christ! the very prison walls
951,I,"Suddenly seemed to reel,"
952,I,And the sky above my head became
953,I,Like a casque of scorching steel;
954,I,"And, though I was a soul in pain,"
955,I,My pain I could not feel.
956,I,
957,I,I only knew what hunted thought
958,I,"Quickened his step, and why"
959,I,He looked upon the garish day
960,I,With such a wistful eye;
961,I,"The man had killed the thing he loved,"
962,I,And so he had to die.
963,I,
964,I,"Yet each man kills the thing he loves,"
965,I,"By each let this be heard,"
966,I,"Some do it with a bitter look,"
967,I,"Some with a flattering word,"
968,I,"The coward does it with a kiss,"
969,I,The brave man with a sword!
970,I,
971,I,"Some kill their love when they are young,"
972,I,And some when they are old;
973,I,"Some strangle with the hands of Lust,"
974,I,Some with the hands of Gold:
975,I,"The kindest use a knife, because"
976,I,The dead so soon grow cold.
977,I,
978,I,"Some love too little, some too long,"
979,I,"Some sell, and others buy;"
980,I,"Some do the deed with many tears,"
981,I,And some without a sigh:
982,I,"For each man kills the thing he loves,"
983,I,Yet each man does not die.
984,I,
985,I,He does not die a death of shame
986,I,"On a day of dark disgrace,"
987,I,"Nor have a noose about his neck,"
988,I,"Nor a cloth upon his face,"
989,I,Nor drop feet foremost through the floor
990,I,Into an empty space.
991,I,
992,I,He does not wake at dawn to see
993,I,"Dread figures throng his room,"
994,I,"The shivering Chaplain robed in white,"
995,I,"The Sheriff stern with gloom,"
996,I,"And the Governor all in shiny black,"
997,I,With the yellow face of Doom.
998,I,
999,I,He does not rise in piteous haste
1000,I,"To put on convict-clothes,"
1001,I,"While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes"
1002,I,"Each new and nerve-twitched pose,"
1003,I,Fingering a watch whose little ticks
1004,I,Are like horrible hammer-blows.
1005,I,
1006,I,He does not know that sickening thirst
1007,I,"That sands one’s throat, before"
1008,I,The hangman with his gardener’s gloves
1009,I,"Slips through the padded door,"
1010,I,"And binds one with three leathern thongs,"
1011,I,That the throat may thirst no more.
1012,I,
1013,I,He does not bend his head to hear
1014,I,"The Burial Office read,"
1015,I,"Nor, while the terror of his soul"
1016,I,"Tells him he is not dead,"
1017,I,"Cross his own coffin, as he moves"
1018,I,Into the hideous shed.
1019,I,
1020,I,He does not stare upon the air
1021,I,Through a little roof of glass:
1022,I,He does not pray with lips of clay
1023,I,For his agony to pass;
1024,I,Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek
1025,I,The kiss of Caiaphas.
1026,I,
1027,II,II
1028,II,
1029,II,"SIX weeks our guardsman walked the yard,"
1030,II,In the suit of shabby grey:
1031,II,"His cricket cap was on his head,"
1032,II,"And his step seemed light and gay,"
1033,II,But I never saw a man who looked
1034,II,So wistfully at the day.
1035,II,
1036,II,"He did not wring his hands nor weep,"
1037,II,"Nor did he peek or pine,"
1038,II,But he drank the air as though it held
1039,II,Some healthful anodyne;
1040,II,With open mouth he drank the sun
1041,II,As though it had been wine!
1042,II,
1043,II,"And I and all the souls in pain,"
1044,II,"Who tramped the other ring,"
1045,II,Forgot if we ourselves had done
1046,II,"A great or little thing,"
1047,II,And watched with gaze of dull amaze
1048,II,The man who had to swing.
1049,II,
1050,II,So with curious eyes and sick surmise
1051,II,"We watched him day by day,"
1052,II,And wondered if each one of us
1053,II,"Would end the self-same way,"
1054,II,For none can tell to what red Hell
1055,II,His sightless soul may stray.
1056,II,
1057,II,At last the dead man walked no more
1058,II,"Amongst the Trial Men,"
1059,II,And I knew that he was standing up
1060,II,"In the black dock’s dreadful pen,"
1061,II,And that never would I see his face
1062,II,In God’s sweet world again.
1063,II,
1064,II,Like two doomed ships that pass in storm
1065,II,We had crossed each other’s way:
1066,II,"But we made no sign, we said no word,"
1067,II,We had no word to say;
1068,II,"For we did not meet in the holy night,"
1069,II,But in the shameful day.
1070,II,
1071,II,"A prison wall was round us both,"
1072,II,Two outcast men we were:
1073,II,"The world had thrust us from its heart,"
1074,II,And God from out His care:
1075,II,And the iron gin that waits for Sin
1076,II,Had caught us in its snare.
1077,II,
1078,III,III
1079,III,
1080,III,"IN Debtors’ Yard the stones are hard,"
1081,III,"And the dripping wall is high,"
1082,III,So it was there he took the air
1083,III,"Beneath the leaden sky,"
1084,III,"And by each side a Warder walked,"
1085,III,For fear the man might die.
1086,III,
1087,III,Or else he sat with those who watched
1088,III,His anguish night and day;
1089,III,"Who watched him when he rose to weep,"
1090,III,And when he crouched to pray;
1091,III,Who watched him lest himself should rob
1092,III,Their scaffold of its prey.
1093,III,
1094,III,"And twice a day he smoked his pipe,"
1095,III,And drank his quart of beer:
1096,III,"His soul was resolute, and held"
1097,III,No hiding-place for fear;
1098,III,He often said that he was glad
1099,III,The hangman’s hands were near.
1100,III,
1101,III,But why he said so strange a thing
1102,III,No Warder dared to ask:
1103,III,For he to whom a watcher’s doom
1104,III,"Is given as his task,"
1105,III,"Must set a lock upon his lips,"
1106,III,And make his face a mask.
1107,III,
1108,III,With slouch and swing around the ring
1109,III,We trod the Fools’ Parade!
1110,III,We did not care: we knew we were
1111,III,The Devil’s Own Brigade:
1112,III,And shaven head and feet of lead
1113,III,Make a merry masquerade.
1114,III,
1115,III,We tore the tarry rope to shreds
1116,III,With blunt and bleeding nails;
1117,III,"We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,"
1118,III,And cleaned the shining rails:
1119,III,"And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,"
1120,III,And clattered with the pails.
1121,III,
1122,III,"We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,"
1123,III,We turned the dusty drill:
1124,III,"We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,"
1125,III,And sweated on the mill:
1126,III,But in the heart of every man
1127,III,Terror was lying still.
1128,III,
1129,III,So still it lay that every day
1130,III,Crawled like a weed-clogged wave:
1131,III,And we forgot the bitter lot
1132,III,"That waits for fool and knave,"
1133,III,"Till once, as we tramped in from work,"
1134,III,We passed an open grave.
1135,III,
1136,III,"Right in we went, with soul intent"
1137,III,On Death and Dread and Doom:
1138,III,"The hangman, with his little bag,"
1139,III,Went shuffling through the gloom:
1140,III,And each man trembled as he crept
1141,III,Into his numbered tomb.
1142,III,
1143,III,That night the empty corridors
1144,III,"Were full of forms of Fear,"
1145,III,And up and down the iron town
1146,III,"Stole feet we could not hear,"
1147,III,And through the bars that hide the stars
1148,III,White faces seemed to peer.
1149,III,
1150,III,But there is no sleep when men must weep
1151,III,Who never yet have wept:
1152,III,"So we—the fool, the fraud, the knave—"
1153,III,"That endless vigil kept,"
1154,III,And through each brain on hands of pain
1155,III,Another’s terror crept.
1156,III,
1157,III,Alas! it is a fearful thing
1158,III,To feel another’s guilt!
1159,III,"For, right within, the sword of Sin"
1160,III,"Pierced to its poisoned hilt,"
1161,III,And as molten lead were the tears we shed
1162,III,For the blood we had not spilt.
1163,III,
1164,III,The Warders with their shoes of felt
1165,III,"Crept by each padlocked door,"
1166,III,"And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,"
1167,III,"Grey figures on the floor,"
1168,III,And wondered why men knelt to pray
1169,III,Who never prayed before.
1170,III,
1171,III,"The morning wind began to moan,"
1172,III,But still the night went on:
1173,III,Through its giant loom the web of gloom
1174,III,Crept till each thread was spun:
1175,III,"And, as we prayed, we grew afraid"
1176,III,Of the Justice of the Sun.
1177,III,
1178,III,"At last I saw the shadowed bars,"
1179,III,"Like a lattice wrought in lead,"
1180,III,Move right across the whitewashed wall
1181,III,"That faced my three-plank bed,"
1182,III,And I knew that somewhere in the world
1183,III,God’s dreadful dawn was red.
1184,III,
1185,III,"At six o’clock we cleaned our cells,"
1186,III,"At seven all was still,"
1187,III,But the sough and swing of a mighty wing
1188,III,"The prison seemed to fill,"
1189,III,For the Lord of Death with icy breath
1190,III,Had entered in to kill.
1191,III,
1192,III,"He did not pass in purple pomp,"
1193,III,Nor ride a moon-white steed.
1194,III,Three yards of cord and a sliding board
1195,III,Are all the gallows’ need:
1196,III,So with rope of shame the Herald came
1197,III,To do the secret deed.
1198,III,
1199,III,We waited for the stroke of eight:
1200,III,Each tongue was thick with thirst:
1201,III,For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate
1202,III,"That makes a man accursed,"
1203,III,And Fate will use a running noose
1204,III,For the best man and the worst.
1205,III,
1206,III,"We had no other thing to do,"
1207,III,Save to wait for the sign to come:
1208,III,"So, like things of stone in a valley lone,"
1209,III,Quiet we sat and dumb:
1210,III,"But each man’s heart beat thick and quick,"
1211,III,Like a madman on a drum!
1212,III,
1213,III,With sudden shock the prison-clock
1214,III,"Smote on the shivering air,"
1215,III,And from all the gaol rose up a wail
1216,III,"Of impotent despair,"
1217,III,Like the sound that frightened marshes hear
1218,III,From some leper in his lair.
1219,III,
1220,III,And as one sees most fearful things
1221,III,"In the crystal of a dream,"
1222,III,We saw the greasy hempen rope
1223,III,"Hooked to the blackened beam,"
1224,III,And heard the prayer the hangman’s snare
1225,III,Strangled into a scream.
1226,III,
1227,III,And all the woe that moved him so
1228,III,"That he gave that bitter cry,"
1229,III,"And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,"
1230,III,None knew so well as I:
1231,III,For he who lives more lives than one
1232,III,More deaths than one must die.
1233,III,
1234,IV,IV
1235,IV,
1236,IV,THERE is no chapel on the day
1237,IV,On which they hang a man:
1238,IV,"The Chaplain’s heart is far too sick,"
1239,IV,"Or his face is far too wan,"
1240,IV,Or there is that written in his eyes
1241,IV,Which none should look upon.
1242,IV,
1243,IV,"So they kept us close till nigh on noon,"
1244,IV,"And then they rang the bell,"
1245,IV,And the Warders with their jingling keys
1246,IV,"Opened each listening cell,"
1247,IV,"And down the iron stair we tramped,"
1248,IV,Each from his separate Hell.
1249,IV,
1250,IV,"Out into God’s sweet air we went,"
1251,IV,"But not in wonted way,"
1252,IV,"For this man’s face was white with fear,"
1253,IV,"And that man’s face was grey,"
1254,IV,And I never saw sad men who looked
1255,IV,So wistfully at the day.
1256,IV,
1257,IV,I never saw sad men who looked
1258,IV,With such a wistful eye
1259,IV,Upon that little tent of blue
1260,IV,"We prisoners called the sky,"
1261,IV,And at every careless cloud that passed
1262,IV,In happy freedom by.
1263,IV,
1264,IV,But there were those amongst us all
1265,IV,"Who walked with downcast head,"
1266,IV,"And knew that, had each got his due,"
1267,IV,They should have died instead:
1268,IV,"He had but killed a thing that lived,"
1269,IV,Whilst they had killed the dead.
1270,IV,
1271,IV,For he who sins a second time
1272,IV,"Wakes a dead soul to pain,"
1273,IV,"And draws it from its spotted shroud,"
1274,IV,"And makes it bleed again,"
1275,IV,"And makes it bleed great gouts of blood,"
1276,IV,And makes it bleed in vain!
1277,IV,
1278,IV,"Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb"
1279,IV,"With crooked arrows starred,"
1280,IV,Silently we went round and round
1281,IV,The slippery asphalte yard;
1282,IV,"Silently we went round and round,"
1283,IV,And no man spoke a word.
1284,IV,
1285,IV,"Silently we went round and round,"
1286,IV,And through each hollow mind
1287,IV,The Memory of dreadful things
1288,IV,"Rushed like a dreadful wind,"
1289,IV,"And Horror stalked before each man,"
1290,IV,And Terror crept behind.
1291,IV,
1292,IV,"The Warders strutted up and down,"
1293,IV,"And kept their herd of brutes,"
1294,IV,"Their uniforms were spick and span,"
1295,IV,"And they wore their Sunday suits,"
1296,IV,"But we knew the work they had been at,"
1297,IV,By the quicklime on their boots.
1298,IV,
1299,IV,"For where a grave had opened wide,"
1300,IV,There was no grave at all:
1301,IV,Only a stretch of mud and sand
1302,IV,"By the hideous prison-wall,"
1303,IV,"And a little heap of burning lime,"
1304,IV,That the man should have his pall.
1305,IV,
1306,IV,"For he has a pall, this wretched man,"
1307,IV,Such as few men can claim:
1308,IV,"Deep down below a prison-yard,"
1309,IV,"Naked for greater shame,"
1310,IV,"He lies, with fetters on each foot,"
1311,IV,Wrapt in a sheet of flame!
1312,IV,
1313,IV,For three long years they will not sow
1314,IV,Or root or seedling there:
1315,IV,For three long years the unblessed spot
1316,IV,"Will sterile be and bare,"
1317,IV,And look upon the wondering sky
1318,IV,With unreproachful stare.
1319,IV,
1320,IV,They think a murderer’s heart would taint
1321,IV,Each simple seed they sow.
1322,IV,It is not true!  God’s kindly earth
1323,IV,"Is kindlier than men know,"
1324,IV,"And the red rose would but blow more red,"
1325,IV,The white rose whiter blow.
1326,IV,
1327,IV,"Out of his mouth a red, red rose!"
1328,IV,Out of his heart a white!
1329,IV,"For who can say by what strange way,"
1330,IV,"Christ brings His will to light,"
1331,IV,Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore
1332,IV,Bloomed in the great Pope’s sight?
1333,IV,
1334,IV,But neither milk-white rose nor red
1335,IV,May bloom in prison-air;
1336,IV,"The shard, the pebble, and the flint,"
1337,IV,Are what they give us there:
1338,IV,For flowers have been known to heal
1339,IV,A common man’s despair.
1340,IV,
1341,IV,"So never will wine-red rose or white,"
1342,IV,"Petal by petal, fall"
1343,IV,On that stretch of mud and sand that lies
1344,IV,"By the hideous prison-wall,"
1345,IV,To tell the men who tramp the yard
1346,IV,That God’s Son died for all.
1347,IV,
1348,IV,He is at peace—this wretched man—
1349,IV,"At peace, or will be soon:"
1350,IV,"There is no thing to make him mad,"
1351,IV,"Nor does Terror walk at noon,"
1352,IV,For the lampless Earth in which he lies
1353,IV,Has neither Sun nor Moon.
1354,IV,
1355,IV,The Chaplain would not kneel to pray
1356,IV,By his dishonoured grave:
1357,IV,Nor mark it with that blessed Cross
1358,IV,"That Christ for sinners gave,"
1359,IV,Because the man was one of those
1360,IV,Whom Christ came down to save.
1361,IV,
1362,IV,Yet all is well; he has but passed
1363,IV,To Life’s appointed bourne:
1364,IV,And alien tears will fill for him
1365,IV,"Pity’s long-broken urn,"
1366,IV,"For his mourners will be outcast men,"
1367,IV,And outcasts always mourn.

1520,AVE IMPERATRIX,
1521,AVE IMPERATRIX,"Peace, peace! we wrong the noble dead"
1522,AVE IMPERATRIX,To vex their solemn slumber so;

2196,FLOWER OF LOVE,
2197,FLOWER OF LOVE,
2198,FLOWER OF LOVE,"SWEET, I blame you not, for mine the fault"
2199,FLOWER OF LOVE,"was, had I not been made of common clay"
2200,FLOWER OF LOVE,I had climbed the higher heights unclimbed
2201,FLOWER OF LOVE,"yet, seen the fuller air, the larger day."
2202,FLOWER OF LOVE,
2203,FLOWER OF LOVE,From the wildness of my wasted passion I had
2204,FLOWER OF LOVE,"struck a better, clearer song,"
2205,FLOWER OF LOVE,"Lit some lighter light of freer freedom, battled"
2206,FLOWER OF LOVE,with some Hydra-headed wrong.
2207,FLOWER OF LOVE,
2208,FLOWER OF LOVE,Had my lips been smitten into music by the
2209,FLOWER OF LOVE,"kisses that but made them bleed,"
2210,FLOWER OF LOVE,You had walked with Bice and the angels on
2211,FLOWER OF LOVE,that verdant and enamelled mead.
2212,FLOWER OF LOVE,
2213,FLOWER OF LOVE,I had trod the road which Dante treading saw
2214,FLOWER OF LOVE,"the suns of seven circles shine,"
2215,FLOWER OF LOVE,"Ay! perchance had seen the heavens opening,"
2216,FLOWER OF LOVE,as they opened to the Florentine.
2217,FLOWER OF LOVE,
2218,FLOWER OF LOVE,And the mighty nations would have crowned
2219,FLOWER OF LOVE,"me, who am crownless now and without name,"
2220,FLOWER OF LOVE,And some orient dawn had found me kneeling
2221,FLOWER OF LOVE,on the threshold of the House of Fame.
2222,FLOWER OF LOVE,
2223,FLOWER OF LOVE,I had sat within that marble circle where the
2224,FLOWER OF LOVE,"oldest bard is as the young,"
2225,FLOWER OF LOVE,"And the pipe is ever dropping honey, and the"
2226,FLOWER OF LOVE,lyre’s strings are ever strung.
2227,FLOWER OF LOVE,
2228,FLOWER OF LOVE,Keats had lifted up his hymeneal curls from out
2229,FLOWER OF LOVE,"the poppy-seeded wine,"
2230,FLOWER OF LOVE,"With ambrosial mouth had kissed my forehead,"
2231,FLOWER OF LOVE,clasped the hand of noble love in mine.
2232,FLOWER OF LOVE,
2233,FLOWER OF LOVE,"And at springtide, when the apple-blossoms"
2234,FLOWER OF LOVE,"brush the burnished bosom of the dove,"
2235,FLOWER OF LOVE,Two young lovers lying in an orchard would
2236,FLOWER OF LOVE,have read the story of our love;
2237,FLOWER OF LOVE,
2238,FLOWER OF LOVE,"Would have read the legend of my passion,"
2239,FLOWER OF LOVE,"known the bitter secret of my heart,"
2240,FLOWER OF LOVE,"Kissed as we have kissed, but never parted as"
2241,FLOWER OF LOVE,we two are fated now to part.
2242,FLOWER OF LOVE,
2243,FLOWER OF LOVE,For the crimson flower of our life is eaten by
2244,FLOWER OF LOVE,"the cankerworm of truth,"
2245,FLOWER OF LOVE,And no hand can gather up the fallen withered
2246,FLOWER OF LOVE,petals of the rose of youth.
2247,FLOWER OF LOVE,
2248,FLOWER OF LOVE,Yet I am not sorry that I loved you—ah!
2249,FLOWER OF LOVE,"what else had I a boy to do,—"
2250,FLOWER OF LOVE,"For the hungry teeth of time devour, and the"
2251,FLOWER OF LOVE,silent-footed years pursue.
2252,FLOWER OF LOVE,
2253,FLOWER OF LOVE,"Rudderless, we drift athwart a tempest, and"
2254,FLOWER OF LOVE,"when once the storm of youth is past,"
2255,FLOWER OF LOVE,"Without lyre, without lute or chorus, Death"
2256,FLOWER OF LOVE,the silent pilot comes at last.
2257,FLOWER OF LOVE,
2258,FLOWER OF LOVE,"And within the grave there is no pleasure,"
2259,FLOWER OF LOVE,"for the blindworm battens on the root,"
2260,FLOWER OF LOVE,"And Desire shudders into ashes, and the tree"
2261,FLOWER OF LOVE,of Passion bears no fruit.
2262,FLOWER OF LOVE,
2263,FLOWER OF LOVE,Ah! what else had I to do but love you?
2264,FLOWER OF LOVE,"God’s own mother was less dear to me,"
2265,FLOWER OF LOVE,And less dear the Cytheræan rising like an
2266,FLOWER OF LOVE,argent lily from the sea.
2267,FLOWER OF LOVE,
2268,FLOWER OF LOVE,"I have made my choice, have lived my"
2269,FLOWER OF LOVE,"poems, and, though youth is gone in wasted days,"
2270,FLOWER OF LOVE,I have found the lover’s crown of myrtle better
2271,FLOWER OF LOVE,than the poet’s crown of bays.
