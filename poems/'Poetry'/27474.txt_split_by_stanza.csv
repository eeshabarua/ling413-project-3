6,QUEEN BERNGERD,QUEEN BERNGERD 
7,QUEEN BERNGERD,"Long ere the Sun the heaven arrayed, For her morning gift her Lord she prayed: ""Give me Samsoe to have and to hold, And from every maiden a crown of gold."" _Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_. "
8,QUEEN BERNGERD,"The King he answered Berngerd thus: ""Madam, crave something less of us, For many a maid lives 'neath our sway To 'scape from death could the like not pay."" _Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_. "
9,QUEEN BERNGERD,"""My gentle Lord, then hear my prayer, Suffer not ladies the scarlet to wear; And, Sir, you must grant me this boon beside, Let no boor's son a good courser ride."" _Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_. "
10,QUEEN BERNGERD,"""What ladies can buy to wear they are free, And hindrance none they shall meet from me; If the son of a Boor can a horse support, 'Fore God, I'll never destroy his sport!"" _Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_. "
11,QUEEN BERNGERD,"""My Lord, we'll that matter let drop to the ground; With chains of steel let the land be bound, So that man or woman thereout or therein Withouten toll cannot hope to win."" _Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_. "
12,QUEEN BERNGERD,"""How should we so much steel obtain, As to bind therewith the land and main? O Madam! some mercy and kindness shew, Or expect the curse of the people now."" _Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_. "
13,QUEEN BERNGERD,"""To Ribe, to winter there, we'll depart, There smiths we shall find well skilled in their art; Both locks and keys will we have made, And toeen and iron palisade."" _Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_. "
14,QUEEN BERNGERD,"""Faggot and coal shall the boor give free, The smith shall work without thanks or fee. My Lord, be persuaded, I rede ye do, Much benefit thence shall to thee accrue."" _Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_. "
15,QUEEN BERNGERD,"""My father was King in the land before me, And a King for his father also had he; The Kings of the Danes to live contrive Without Boor and Burger skinning alive."" _Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_. "
16,QUEEN BERNGERD,"""Sir, what would a peasant more Than a latticed window and wicker door? What shall a peasant keep in his stall Save one draught ox and a cow withall? _Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_. "
17,QUEEN BERNGERD,"""Each peasant's wife of a son made light Shall give me an ounce of gold so bright; But if to a daughter birth she give, Only the half I'm content to receive."" _Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_. "
18,QUEEN BERNGERD,"The King he turned on his other side, He'd heard enough to suffice for that tide. As soon as sleep his brow came o'er, Dagmar he thought stood his face before. _Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_. "
19,QUEEN BERNGERD,"""The bitter flower, Sir King, you hold, Brings you trouble, as I foretold. Be sure if this year you seek the fray, You suffer not Berngerd at home to stay. _Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_. "
20,QUEEN BERNGERD,"""If she with her flatteries blind your eyes, The child will weep in the cradle that lies. Take her with you, I rede and beseech, How that will boot you time will teach."" _Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_. "
21,QUEEN BERNGERD,"The King has proclaimed through the whole country, To the war with him each tenth man should hie. ""My dearest Lady, worthy thou art In the field of honour to bear a part."" _Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_. "
22,QUEEN BERNGERD,"The first shaft shot on the battle day To the heart of Berngerd found its way; No soul was seen with a tearful eye-- Who for Berngerd would sorrow or sigh? _Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_. "
23,QUEEN BERNGERD,"Now lies Berngerd in the cold black ground, Oxen are still in the Boor's stall found. Berngerd she lies 'neath the dingy sward, The Danes their Monarch love and regard. _Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_. "
24,QUEEN BERNGERD,"Now Berngerd lies in eternal pains, The boor his horse and cow retains. A name she left of such evil savour, So little the poor man did she favour. _Woe befall her_,_ Berngerd_. "
25,QUEEN BERNGERD,"'Tis better to live in humble state, Than rich with a poor man's curse and hate; After virtue better to ceaseless strain Than the wealth of the world with scorn obtain. _Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_. "
26,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN 
27,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"Dame Martha dwelt at Karisegaard, So many kind deeds she wrought: If the winter were sharp and the rich man hard, Her gate the indigent sought. "
28,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"With her hand the hungry she loved to feed, To the sick she lent her aid; The prisoner oft from his chains she freed, And for souls of sinners pray'd. "
29,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"Denmark's land was in peril dire, The Swede around burnt and slew; The castle of Martha was wrapped in fire, To the church the good lady flew. "
30,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"She dwelt in the tower both night and day, There unto her none repaired; 'Neath the church roof sat the dull owl gray, And at the good lady stared. "
31,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"In the house of the Lord she dwelt safe and content 'Till the foes their departure had ta'en; Then back to her ruined castle she went, And bade it be builded again. "
32,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"There found the houseless a cover once more, And the mouths of the hungry bread; But all in Karise-By {14} wept sore When they knew Dame Martha dead. "
33,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"And when the Dame lay in her coffin and smil'd, So calm with her pallid face, O there was never so little a child But was brought on her to gaze. "
34,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"The bell on the day of the burial toll'd, And youth and age shed the tear; No man was ever so weak or old But helped to lift the bier. "
35,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"When they the bier set down for a space, And rested upon the road, A fountain sprang forth in that very place, To this hour has it flow'd. "
36,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"God bless for ever the pious soul, Her blessings no lips can tell; For oft have the sick become sound and whole, Who drank at Dame Martha's well! "
37,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"The tower yet stands with gloomy nook, Where Dame Martha sat of old; The stranger comes thereon to look, And to hear the story told. "
38,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS 
39,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"O'er the sweet smelling meads with his lyre in his hand The bard was straying; In the twilight of evening, refreshing and bland, His chords were playing. He sang of the flowrets that slept in the tomb, He sang of the flowrets that poured their perfume, He sang of the flowrets that yet were to bloom. "
40,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"And the rose departed, A smile from its sepulchre darted; And the rose yet living with blushes of red Breathed sweets o'er his head. And the rose which unborn concealed yet lies, Seemed to open before his eyes. By a fountain's side with verdure array'd Himself he laid. "
41,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"And the murmur and hum of the pure water fleeting, And the strains, which the birds of the wood were repeating, And the innocent heart, which so peaceful was beating, Shed health-giving slumbers, On lids which no sorrow cumbers. "
42,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,In the visions of sleep there came to his side A sire with locks snow-hoary; And the songster sped with that sire for his guide To an unknown territory. 
43,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"On ruins majestic himself he found, The mouldering bones of old heroes lay round; Their ghosts awaking Rose from their graves wild gestures making. The youth was quaking-- But the old man smiled as his mind he led To the kempion times long fled. "
44,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"Then a lamp in the night's deep silence shone Through the dingy mould, And under the masses of fallen stone There glittered gold. "
45,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"To the harp then pointing the sage disappears, And the youth shed tears. ""Yes, yes, the young bard thy countenance knows,"" So sang in wild passion the boy-- ""Not in vain in my bosom a holy fire glows, Not in vain thy bright lamp the grave's mystery shews, The bard will obey thee with joy."" "
46,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"Again there appeared in the dreams of the stripling A being who held him intent; It came as in flood come the high billows rippling, Like billows when ebbing it went. "
47,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"Though the look of an aged and slow female wearing, It ran like the breezes in spring time careering, Full often it vanished with threatening bearing. But suddenly caught he the fugitive wild, And then by his breast a maiden smil'd. ""Thee often I've met on life's journey,"" he said, ""And when like a meteor thou past me hast sped, I've seen thee look backward--and threaten. "
48,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"""O! kiss me, sweet maiden, ere on thou dost stray, I've seen thee with flowers strew the wanderer's way. They lived in their brightness, When thou in this lightness, Had'st fled farthest off; and sometimes they became A Bauta-stone over the worm-wasted frame. "
49,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"""Vouchsafe me a smile,"" said the youth, ""I entreat, I know thy course lightning-fleet. Thy light pinions ever Thou pliest, sweet giver Of palms, verdant palms, to the stripling so clever, Who caught thee, though lightning fleet."" "
50,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"Again to his eye a fair vision was given, A being angelical stood in the heaven. In morn's fresh rose-hues drest Stood the spirit blest. As shines from above The starlet of love So kindled his glance toward earth's gentle child. As the maid to her beckons the youth she loves dearly, When vespers are chiming and Luna shines clearly, So toward him beckoned the Angel, and smil'd. "
51,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"With rapture the songster took thither his way, Where the winged one of heaven stood beauteous and gay. But, just as he hoped that the height was surmounted, Far distant again they each other confronted. And still the Angel beckoned there, But--never, never near. ""My seraph! wilt ever avoid my embrace?"" --Said the songster with mortified mien-- ""But though I'm unable to climb to thy place, My eye thou hast blest from the mansions of grace, And thy heaven, thou distant, I've seen."" "
52,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"His slumber departed, his visions they fled, But oft when he harped they came into his head. ""Blest, trebly blest, may our life be regarded, Far unto me hear threefold life is awarded. "
53,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"""See the roselet departed, A smile from its tomb has darted. And the rose, which yet lives in blushes and bloom, Breathes o'er me perfume. Yes, from its concealment, the unborn rose Before me seems to unclose."" "
54,KING OLUF THE SAINT,KING OLUF THE SAINT 
55,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"King Oluf and his brother bold, 'Bout Norroway's rocks a parley hold. (_So sweet in Drontheim 'tis to dwell_!) "
56,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""The one of us two who best can sail, Shall rule o'er Norroway's hill and dale. "
57,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""Who first of us reaches our native ground, O'er all the region shall King be crown'd."" "
58,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Then Harald Haardrode answer made: ""Aye, let it be even as thou hast said. "
59,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""But if I to-day must sail with thee, Thou shalt change vessels, I swear, with me. "
60,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""For thou hast got the Dragon of speed, I shall make with the Ox a poor figure indeed. "
61,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""The dragon is swift as the clouds in chase, The ox he moveth at lazy pace."" "
62,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""Hear, Harald, what I shall say to thee, What thou hast proposed well pleaseth me. "
63,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""If my ship in aught be better than thine, I'm readily, cheerfully lend thee mine. "
64,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""Do thou the Dragon so sprightly take, And I with the Ox will the journey make. "
65,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""But first to the Church we'll bend our way, Ere our hand on sail or on oar we lay."" "
66,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"And into the Church Saint Oluf trode, His beautiful hair like the bright gold glow'd. "
67,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"But soon out of breath there came a man: ""Thy brother is sailing off, fast as he can."" "
68,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""Let them sail, my friend, who to sail may choose, The word of our Lord we will not lose, "
69,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""The Mass is the word of our blessed Lord. Take water, ye swains, for our table board. "
70,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""We will sit at board, and the bread we will taste, Then unto the sea-shore will we haste."" "
71,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Now down they all sped to the ocean strand, Where the Ox lay rocking before the land. "
72,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"And speedily they to the ocean bore The anchor, and cable, the sail and oar. "
73,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Saint Oluf he stood on the prow when on board: ""Now forward, thou Ox, in the name of the Lord!"" "
74,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"He grappled the Ox by the horn so white: ""Hie now as if thou went clover to bite!"" "
75,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Then forward the Ox began to hie, In his wake roll'd the billows boisterously. "
76,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"He hallooed to the lad on the yard so high: ""Do we the Dragon of Harald draw nigh?"" "
77,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""No more of the pomps of the world I see, Than the uppermost top of the good oak tree. "
78,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""I see, 'neath the land of Norroway, skim Bright silken sails with a golden rim. "
79,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""I see, 'neath Norroway's mountains proud, The Dragon bearing of sail a cloud. "
80,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""I see, I see, by Norroway's side, The Dragon gallantly forward stride!"" "
81,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"On the ribs of the Ox a blow he gave: ""Now faster, faster, over the wave!"" "
82,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"He struck the Ox on the eye with force: ""To the haven much speedier thou must course!"" "
83,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Then forward the Ox began to leap, No sailor on deck his stand could keep. "
84,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Then cords he took, and his mariners fast He tied to the vessel's sheets and mast. "
85,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"'Twas then, 'twas then, the steersman cried: ""But who shall now the vessel guide?"" "
86,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"His white gloves off Saint Oluf throws, And he himself to the rudder goes. "
87,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""O we will sail o'er cliff and height, The nearest way like a line of light."" "
88,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"So o'er the hills and dales they career, To them they became like water clear. "
89,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"They sailed along o'er the mountains blue, Then out came running the Elfin crew. "
90,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""Who sails o'er the gold in which we joy? Our ancient father who dares annoy?"" "
91,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""Elf, turn to stone and a stone remain, Till I by this path return again!"" "
92,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"So they sailed o'er Skaaney's mountains tall, And stones became the little elves all. "
93,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Out came a Carline, with spindle and rok: ""Saint Oluf! why sailest thou us to mock? "
94,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""Saint Oluf, thou who the red beard hast, Through my chamber wall thy ship hath passed."" "
95,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"With a glance of scorn did Saint Oluf say: ""Stand there a flint rock for ever and aye!"" "
96,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Unchided, unhindered, they bravely sailed on, Before them yielded both stock and stone. "
97,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Still onward they sailed in such gallant guise, That no man upon them could fix his eyes. "
98,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Saint Oluf a bow before his knee bent, Behind the sail dropped the shaft he sent. "
99,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"From the prow Saint Oluf a barb shot free, Behind the Ox fell the shaft in the sea. "
100,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Saint Oluf he trusted In Christ alone, And therefore home by three days he won. "
101,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"That made Harald with fury storm, Of a laidly dragon he took the form. "
102,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"But the Saint was a man of devotion full, And the Saint gat Norroway's land to rule. "
103,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Into the Church Saint Oluf strode, He thanked the Saviour in fervent mode. "
104,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Saint Oluf walked the Church about, There shone a glory his ringlets out. "
105,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Whom God doth help makes bravely his way, His enemies win but shame and dismay. "
106,TO SCRIBBLERS {30},TO SCRIBBLERS {30} 
107,TO SCRIBBLERS {30},"Would it not be more dignified To run up debts on every side, And then to pay your debts refuse, Than write for rascally Reviews? And lectures give to great and small, In pothouse, theatre, and town-hall, Wearing your brains by night and day To win the means to pay your way? I vow by him who reigns in [hell], It would be more respectable! "
108,TO A CONCEITED WOMAN,TO A CONCEITED WOMAN 
109,TO A CONCEITED WOMAN,"Be still, be still, and speak not back again. What right have you to answer in this strain? Whilst I'm a man, a prince of the creation, You're but a female woman by your station; A creature for man's sovereign service born, Whose fitting wages are contempt and scorn. A creature formed to dive down in the sea To fetch up sea-eggs for the likes of me; Only too grateful, when we've stilled our greed, If on our leavings you're allowed to feed. If thus I speak, I speak on public grounds, My only aim is to keep well in bounds. "
