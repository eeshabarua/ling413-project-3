21,PREFACE,PREFACE
22,PREFACE,
23,PREFACE,
24,PREFACE,The following volume is composed of a number of papers written at
25,PREFACE,various times and already partially printed; they are now revised and
26,PREFACE,"gathered together in the hope that they may lead the reader, from"
27,PREFACE,"somewhat different points of approach, to a single idea. This idea is"
28,PREFACE,"that religion and poetry are identical in essence, and differ merely"
29,PREFACE,in the way in which they are attached to practical affairs. Poetry
30,PREFACE,"is called religion when it intervenes in life, and religion, when it"
31,PREFACE,"merely supervenes upon life, is seen to be nothing but poetry."
32,PREFACE,
33,PREFACE,It would naturally follow from this conception that religious doctrines
34,PREFACE,would do well to withdraw their pretension to be dealing with matters
35,PREFACE,of fact. That pretension is not only the source of the conflicts of
36,PREFACE,religion with science and of the vain and bitter controversies of
37,PREFACE,sects; it is also the cause of the impurity and incoherence of religion
38,PREFACE,"in the soul, when it seeks its sanctions in the sphere of reality,"
39,PREFACE,and forgets that its proper concern is to express the ideal. For the
40,PREFACE,"dignity of religion, like that of poetry and of every moral ideal, lies"
41,PREFACE,"precisely in its ideal adequacy, in its fit rendering of the meanings"
42,PREFACE,"and values of life, in its anticipation of perfection; so that the"
43,PREFACE,"excellence of religion is due to an idealization of experience which,"
44,PREFACE,"while making religion noble if treated as poetry, makes it necessarily"
45,PREFACE,false if treated as science. Its function is rather to draw from
46,PREFACE,reality materials for an image of that ideal to which reality ought
47,PREFACE,"to conform, and to make us citizens, by anticipation, in the world we"
48,PREFACE,crave.
49,PREFACE,
50,PREFACE,It also follows from our general conception that poetry has a universal
51,PREFACE,and a moral function. Its rudimentary essays in the region of fancy
52,PREFACE,"and pleasant sound, as well as its idealization of episodes in human"
53,PREFACE,"existence, are only partial exercises in an art that has all time and"
54,PREFACE,all experience for its natural subject-matter and all the possibilities
55,PREFACE,of being for its ultimate theme. As religion is deflected from its
56,PREFACE,"course when it is confused with a record of facts or of natural laws,"
57,PREFACE,so poetry is arrested in its development if it remains an unmeaning
58,PREFACE,play of fancy without relevance to the ideals and purposes of life. In
59,PREFACE,that relevance lies its highest power. As its elementary pleasantness
60,PREFACE,"comes from its response to the demands of the ear, so its deepest"
61,PREFACE,beauty comes from its response to the ultimate demands of the soul.
62,PREFACE,
63,PREFACE,This theory can hardly hope for much commendation either from the
64,PREFACE,apologists of theology or from its critics. The mass of mankind is
65,PREFACE,"divided into two classes, the Sancho Panzas who have a sense for"
66,PREFACE,"reality, but no ideals, and the Don Quixotes with a sense for ideals,"
67,PREFACE,but mad. The expedient of recognizing facts as facts and accepting
68,PREFACE,"ideals as ideals,--and this is all we propose,--although apparently"
69,PREFACE,"simple enough, seems to elude the normal human power of discrimination."
70,PREFACE,"If, therefore, the champion of any orthodoxy should be offended at our"
71,PREFACE,"conception, which would reduce his artful cosmos to an allegory, all"
72,PREFACE,that could be said to mitigate his displeasure would be that our view
73,PREFACE,is even less favourable to his opponents than to himself.
74,PREFACE,
75,PREFACE,The liberal school that attempts to fortify religion by minimizing
76,PREFACE,"its expression, both theoretic and devotional, seems from this point"
77,PREFACE,of view to be merely impoverishing religious symbols and vulgarizing
78,PREFACE,religious aims; it subtracts from faith that imagination by which faith
79,PREFACE,"becomes an interpretation and idealization of human life, and retains"
80,PREFACE,only a stark and superfluous principle of superstition. For meagre and
81,PREFACE,"abstract as may be the content of such a religion, it contains all"
82,PREFACE,the venom of absolute pretensions; it is no less cursed than the more
83,PREFACE,developed systems with a controversial unrest and with a consequent
84,PREFACE,undertone of constraint and suspicion. It tortures itself with the
85,PREFACE,same circular proofs in its mistaken ambition to enter the plane of
86,PREFACE,vulgar reality and escape its native element of ideas. It casts a
87,PREFACE,greater blight than would a civilized orthodoxy on any joyous freedom
88,PREFACE,of thought. For the respect exacted by an establishment is limited and
89,PREFACE,"external, and not greater than its traditional forms probably deserve,"
90,PREFACE,as normal expressions of human feeling and apt symbols of moral truth.
91,PREFACE,"A reasonable deference once shown to authority, the mind remains, under"
92,PREFACE,"such an establishment, inwardly and happily free; the conscience is not"
93,PREFACE,"intimidated, the imagination is not tied up. But the preoccupations of"
94,PREFACE,"a hungry and abstract fanaticism poison the liberty nominally allowed,"
95,PREFACE,"bias all vision, and turn philosophy itself, which should be the purest"
96,PREFACE,"of delights and consolations, into an obsession and a burden to the"
97,PREFACE,soul. In such a spectral form religious illusion does not cease to be
98,PREFACE,"illusion. Mythology cannot become science by being reduced in bulk, but"
99,PREFACE,"it may cease, as a mythology, to be worth having."
100,PREFACE,
101,PREFACE,"On the other hand, the positivistic school of criticism would seem, if"
102,PREFACE,"our theory is right, to have overlooked in its programme the highest"
103,PREFACE,functions of human nature. The environing world can justify itself to
104,PREFACE,the mind only by the free life which it fosters there. All observation
105,PREFACE,"is observation of brute fact, all discipline is mere repression, until"
106,PREFACE,these facts digested and this discipline embodied in humane impulses
107,PREFACE,"become the starting-point for a creative movement of the imagination,"
108,PREFACE,"the firm basis for ideal constructions in society, religion, and art."
109,PREFACE,Only as conditions of these human activities can the facts of nature
110,PREFACE,and history become morally intelligible or practically important. In
111,PREFACE,"themselves they are trivial incidents, gossip of the Fates, cacklings"
112,PREFACE,of their inexhaustible garrulity. To regard the function of man as
113,PREFACE,accomplished when these chance happenings have been recorded by him or
114,PREFACE,"contributed to by his impulsive action, is to ignore his reason, his"
115,PREFACE,"privilege,--shared for the rest with every living creature,--of using"
116,PREFACE,Nature as food and substance for his own life. This human life is not
117,PREFACE,merely animal and passionate. The best and keenest part of it consists
118,PREFACE,"in that very gift of creation and government which, together with all"
119,PREFACE,"the transcendental functions of his own mind, man has significantly"
120,PREFACE,attributed to God as to his highest ideal. Not to see in this rational
121,PREFACE,activity the purpose and standard of all life is to have left human
122,PREFACE,nature half unread. It is to look to the removal of certain incidental
123,PREFACE,obstacles in the work of reason as to the solution of its positive
124,PREFACE,"tasks. In comparison with such apathetic naturalism, all the errors"
125,PREFACE,"and follies of religion are worthy of indulgent sympathy, since they"
126,PREFACE,"represent an effort, however misguided, to interpret and to use the"
127,PREFACE,"materials of experience for moral ends, and to measure the value of"
128,PREFACE,reality by its relation to the ideal.
129,PREFACE,
130,PREFACE,The moral function of the imagination and the poetic nature of religion
131,PREFACE,"form, then, the theme of the following pages. It may not be amiss to"
132,PREFACE,"announce it here, as the rather miscellaneous subjects of these essays"
133,PREFACE,might at first sight obscure the common import of them all.

159,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",
160,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","When we consider the situation of the human mind in Nature, its limited"
161,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","plasticity and few channels of communication with the outer world, we"
162,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","need not wonder that we grope for light, or that we find incoherence"
163,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",and instability in human systems of ideas. The wonder rather is that we
164,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","have done so well, that in the chaos of sensations and passions that"
165,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","fills the mind, we have found any leisure for self-concentration and"
166,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","reflection, and have succeeded in gathering even a light harvest of"
167,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",experience from our distracted labours. Our occasional madness is less
168,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",wonderful than our occasional sanity. Relapses into dreams are to be
169,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",expected in a being whose brief existence is so like a dream; but who
170,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",could have been sure of this sturdy and indomitable perseverance in the
171,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",work of reason in spite of all checks and discouragements?
172,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",
173,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",The resources of the mind are not commensurate with its ambition. Of
174,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","the five senses, three are of little use in the formation of permanent"
175,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","notions: a fourth, sight, is indeed vivid and luminous, but furnishes"
176,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",transcripts of things so highly coloured and deeply modified by the
177,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","medium of sense, that a long labour of analysis and correction is"
178,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",needed before satisfactory conceptions can be extracted from it. For
179,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","this labour, however, we are endowed with the requisite instrument."
180,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","We have memory and we have certain powers of synthesis, abstraction,"
181,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","reproduction, invention,--in a word, we have understanding. But this"
182,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",faculty of understanding has hardly begun its work of deciphering the
183,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","hieroglyphics of sense and framing an idea of reality, when it is"
184,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",crossed by another faculty--the imagination. Perceptions do not remain
185,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","in the mind, as would be suggested by the trite simile of the seal"
186,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","and the wax, passive and changeless, until time wear off their sharp"
187,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","edges and make them fade. No, perceptions fall into the brain rather"
188,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",as seeds into a furrowed field or even as sparks into a keg of powder.
189,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","Each image breeds a hundred more, sometimes slowly and subterraneously,"
190,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",sometimes (when a passionate train is started) with a sudden burst of
191,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","fancy. The mind, exercised by its own fertility and flooded by its"
192,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","inner lights, has infinite trouble to keep a true reckoning of its"
193,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",outward perceptions. It turns from the frigid problems of observation
194,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",to its own visions; it forgets to watch the courses of what should be
195,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","its ""pilot stars."" Indeed, were it not for the power of convention in"
196,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","which, by a sort of mutual cancellation of errors, the more practical"
197,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","and normal conceptions are enshrined, the imagination would carry men"
198,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","wholly away,--the best men first and the vulgar after them. Even as it"
199,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","is, individuals and ages of fervid imagination usually waste themselves"
200,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","in dreams, and must disappear before the race, saddened and dazed,"
201,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","perhaps, by the memory of those visions, can return to its plodding"
202,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",thoughts.
203,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",
204,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","Five senses, then, to gather a small part of the infinite influences"
205,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","that vibrate in Nature, a moderate power of understanding to interpret"
206,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","those senses, and an irregular, passionate fancy to overlay that"
207,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",interpretation--such is the endowment of the human mind. And what is
208,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","its ambition? Nothing less than to construct a picture of all reality,"
209,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","to comprehend its own origin and that of the universe, to discover"
210,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",the laws of both and prophesy their destiny. Is not the disproportion
211,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",enormous? Are not confusions and profound contradictions to be looked
212,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",for in an attempt to build so much out of so little?
213,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",
214,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","Yet the metaphysical ambition we speak of cannot be abandoned, because"
215,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",whatever picture of things we may carry about in our heads we are bound
216,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",to regard as a map of reality; although we may mark certain tracts
217,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","of it ""unexplored country,"" the very existence of such regions is"
218,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","vouched for only by our representation, and is necessarily believed"
219,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","to correspond to our idea. All we can do is, without abandoning"
220,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",the aspiration to knowledge which is the inalienable birthright of
221,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","reason, to control as best we may the formation of our conceptions; to"
222,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",arrange them according to their derivation and measure them by their
223,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","applicability in life, so prudently watching over their growth that we"
224,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",may be spared the deepest of sorrows--to survive the offspring of our
225,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",own thought.
226,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",
227,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",The inadequacy of each of our faculties is what occasions the intrusion
228,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",of some other faculty into its field. The defect of sense calls in
229,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","imagination, the defect of imagination calls in reasoning, the defect"
230,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",of reasoning divination. If our senses were clairvoyant and able to
231,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","observe all that is going on in the world, if our instincts were"
232,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","steady, prompting us to adequate reactions upon these observations, the"
233,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",fancy might remain free. We should not need to call upon it to piece
234,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","out the imperfections of sense and reflection, but we should employ it"
235,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","only in avowed poetry, only in building dream-worlds alongside of the"
236,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","real, not interfering with the latter or confusing it, but repeating"
237,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",its pattern with as many variations as the fertility of our minds
238,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","could supply. As it is, the imagination is brought into the service"
239,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","of sense and instinct, and made to do the work of intelligence. This"
240,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","substitution is the more readily effected, in that imagination and"
241,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","intelligence do not differ in their origin, but only in their validity."
242,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","Understanding is an applicable fiction, a kind of wit with a practical"
243,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","use. Common sense and science live in a world of expurgated mythology,"
244,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","such as Plato wished his poets to compose, a world where the objects"
245,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","are imaginative in their origin and essence, but useful, abstract, and"
246,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",beneficent in their suggestions. The sphere of common sense and science
247,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",is concentric with the sphere of fancy; both move in virtue of the same
248,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",imaginative impulses. The eventual distinction between intelligence and
249,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",imagination is ideal; it arises when we discriminate various functions
250,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","in a life that is dynamically one. Those conceptions which, after"
251,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","they have spontaneously arisen, prove serviceable in practice, and"
252,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","capable of verification in sense, we call ideas of the understanding."
253,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","The others remain ideas of the imagination. The shortness of life,"
254,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","the distractions of passion, and the misrepresentation to which all"
255,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","transmitted knowledge is subject, have made the testing of ideas by"
256,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",practice extremely slow in the history of mankind. Hence the impurity
257,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","of our knowledge, its confusion with fancy, and its painful inadequacy"
258,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",to interpret the whole world of human interests. These shortcomings are
259,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","so many invitations to foreign powers to intervene, so many occasions"
260,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",for new waves of imagination to sweep away the landmarks of our old
261,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","labour, and flood the whole mind with impetuous dreams."
262,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",
263,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",It is accordingly the profounder minds that commonly yield to the
264,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","imagination, because it is these minds that are capable of feeling"
265,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",the greatness of the problems of life and the inadequacy of the
266,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","understanding, with its present resources, to solve them. The same"
267,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","minds are, moreover, often swayed by emotion, by the ever-present"
268,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","desire to find a noble solution to all questions, perhaps a solution"
269,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","already hallowed by authority and intertwined inextricably, for those"
270,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","who have always accepted it, with the sanctions of spiritual life."
271,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","Such a coveted conclusion may easily be one which the understanding,"
272,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","with its basis in sense and its demand for verification, may not be"
273,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",able to reach. Therefore the impassioned soul must pass beyond the
274,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","understanding, or else go unsatisfied; and unless it be as disciplined"
275,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",as it is impassioned it will not tolerate dissatisfaction. From what
276,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","quarter, then, will it draw the wider views, the deeper harmonies,"
277,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",which it craves? Only from the imagination. There is no other faculty
278,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","left to invoke. The imagination, therefore, must furnish to religion"
279,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","and to metaphysics those large ideas tinctured with passion, those"
280,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","supersensible forms shrouded in awe, in which alone a mind of great"
281,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",sweep and vitality can find its congenial objects. Thus the stone
282,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","which the builder, understanding, rejected, becomes the chief stone"
283,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",of the corner; the intuitions which science could not use remain the
284,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",inspiration of poetry and religion.
285,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",
286,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","The imagination, when thus employed to anticipate or correct the"
287,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","conclusions of the understanding, is of course not called imagination"
288,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","by those, who appeal to it. The religious teachers call it prophecy or"
289,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","revelation, the philosophers call it a higher reason. But these names"
290,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","are merely eulogistic synonyms for imagination, implying (what is"
291,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",perfectly possible) that the imagination has not misled us. They imply
292,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",on the contrary that in the given instances the imagination has hit
293,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","upon an ultimate truth. A prophet, unless he be the merely mechanical"
294,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","vehicle of truths he does not understand, cannot be conceived as"
295,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","anything but a man of imagination, whose visions miraculously mirror"
296,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",the truth. A metaphysician who transcends the intellect by his reason
297,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",can be conceived only as using his imagination to such good purpose
298,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",as to divine by it the ideal laws of reality or the ultimate goals of
299,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","moral effort. His reason is an imagination that succeeds, an intuition"
300,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",that guesses the principle of experience. But if this intuition were of
301,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","such a nature that experience could verify it, then that higher reason"
302,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",or imagination would be brought down to the level of the understanding;
303,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","for understanding, as we have defined it, is itself a kind of"
304,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","imagination, an imagination prophetic of experience, a spontaneity of"
305,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",thought by which the science of perception is turned into the art of
306,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",life. The same absence of verification distinguishes revelation from
307,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","science; for when the prophecies of faith are verified, the function"
308,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",of faith is gone. Faith and the higher reason of the metaphysicians
309,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","are therefore forms of imagination believed to be avenues to truth,"
310,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","as dreams or oracles may sometimes be truthful, not because their"
311,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","necessary correspondence to truth can be demonstrated, for then they"
312,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","would be portions of science, but because a man dwelling on those"
313,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","intuitions is conscious of a certain moral transformation, of a certain"
314,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","warmth and energy of life. This emotion, heightening his ideas and"
315,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","giving them power over his will, he calls faith or high philosophy, and"
316,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","under its dominion he is able to face his destiny with enthusiasm, or"
317,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",at least with composure.
318,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",
319,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","The imagination, even when its premonitions are not wholly justified"
320,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","by subsequent experience, has thus a noble role to play in the life"
321,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",of man. Without it his thoughts would be not only far too narrow
322,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","to represent, although it were symbolically, the greatness of the"
323,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","universe, but far too narrow even to render the scope of his own"
324,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",life and the conditions of his practical welfare. Without poetry and
325,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",religion the history of mankind would have been darker than it is. Not
326,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","only would emotional life have been poorer, but the public conscience,"
327,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","the national and family spirit, so useful for moral organization and"
328,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","discipline, would hardly have become articulate. By what a complex"
329,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",and uninspired argumentation would the pure moralist have to insist
330,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",upon those duties which the imagination enforces so powerfully in
331,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","oaths sworn before the gods, in commandments written by the finger of"
332,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","God upon stone tablets, in visions of hell and heaven, in chivalrous"
333,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","love and loyalty, and in the sense of family dignity and honour? What"
334,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","intricate, what unavailing appeals to positive interests would have to"
335,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",be made before those quick reactions could be secured in large bodies
336,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",of people which can be produced by the sight of a flag or the sound
337,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",of a name? The imagination is the great unifier of humanity. Men's
338,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","perceptions may be various, their powers of understanding very unequal;"
339,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","but the imagination is, as it were, the self-consciousness of instinct,"
340,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",the contribution which the inner capacity and demand of the mind makes
341,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",to experience. To indulge the imagination is to express the universal
342,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","self, the common and contagious element in all individuals, that"
343,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",rudimentary potency which they all share. To stimulate the imagination
344,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","is to produce the deepest, the most pertinacious emotions. To repress"
345,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","it is to chill the soul, so that even the clearest perception of the"
346,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",truth remains without the joy and impetuosity of conviction. The
347,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",part played by imagination is thus indispensable; but obviously the
348,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",necessity and beneficence of this contribution makes the dangers
349,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","of it correspondingly great. Wielding a great power, exercising an"
350,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","omnipresent function, the imagination may abuse a great force. While"
351,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","its inspirations coincide with what would be the dictates of reason,"
352,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","were reason audible in the world, all is well, and the progress of man"
353,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",is accelerated by his visions; but being a principle _a priori_ the
354,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",imagination is an irresponsible principle; its rightness is an inward
355,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","rightness, and everything in the real world may turn out to be disposed"
356,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",otherwise than as it would wish. Our imaginative preconceptions
357,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",are then obstacles to the perception of fact and of rational duty;
358,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","the faith that stimulated our efforts and increased our momentum,"
359,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",multiplies our wanderings. The too hasty organization of our thoughts
360,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","becomes the cause of their more prolonged disorganization, for to the"
361,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",natural obscurity of things and the difficulty of making them fit
362,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","together among themselves, we add the cross lights of our prejudices"
363,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",and the impossibility of fitting reality into the frame we have made
364,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",for it in our ignorance of its constitution and extent. And as we love
365,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","our hopes, and detest the experience that seems to contradict them,"
366,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","we add fanaticism to our confusion. The habits of the imagination, in"
367,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","conflict with the facts of sense, thus come to cloud science with"
368,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","passion, with fiction, with sentimental prejudice. Nor is this the"
369,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",end of our troubles. For Imagination herself suffers violence in this
370,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","struggle; she seeks to reduce herself to conformity with existence,"
371,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",in the hope of vindicating her nominal authority at the price of some
372,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",concessions. She begins to feign that she demanded nothing but what
373,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","she finds. Thus she loses her honesty and freedom, becomes a flatterer"
374,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","of things instead of the principle of their ideal correction, and in"
375,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",the attempt to prove herself prophetic and literally valid (as in a
376,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",moment of infatuation she had fancied herself to be) she forfeits that
377,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","symbolic truth, that inner propriety, which gave her a moral value."
378,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",Thus the false steps of the imagination lead to a contorted science and
379,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",to a servile ideal.
380,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",
381,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",These complications not unnaturally inspire discouragement and a sense
382,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","of the hopeless relativity of human thought. Indeed, if there be any"
383,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","special endowment of mind and body called human nature, as there seems"
384,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","to be, it is obvious that all human experience must be relative to"
385,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","that. But the truth, the absolute reality, surrounds and precedes"
386,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","these operations of finite faculty. What value, then, we may say, have"
387,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","these various ideals or perceptions, or the conflicts between them?"
388,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","Are not our senses as human, as ""subjective"" as our wills? Is not the"
389,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",understanding as visionary as the fancy? Does it not transform the
390,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",Unknowable into as remote a symbol as does the vainest dream?
391,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",
392,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",The answer which a rational philosophy would make to these questions
393,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",would be a double one. It is true that every idea is equally relative
394,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",to human nature and that nothing can be represented in the human mind
395,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",except by the operation of human faculties. But it is not true that all
396,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","these products of human ideation are of equal value, since they are not"
397,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",equally conducive to human purposes or satisfactory to human demands.
398,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",
399,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",The impulse that would throw over as equally worthless every product
400,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","of human art, because it is not indistinguishable from some alleged"
401,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","external reality, does not perceive the serious self-contradictions"
402,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",under which it labours. In the first place the notion of an external
403,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","reality is a human notion; our reason makes that hypothesis, and its"
404,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","verification in our experience is one of the ideals of science, as its"
405,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",validity is one of the assumptions of daily life. In throwing over all
406,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","human ideas, because they are infected with humanity, all human ideas"
407,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",are being sacrificed to one of them--the idea of an absolute reality.
408,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","If this idea, being human, deserved that such sacrifices should be made"
409,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","for it, have the other notions of the mind no rights? Furthermore, even"
410,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",if we granted for the sake of argument a reality which our thoughts
411,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","were essentially helpless to represent, whence comes the duty of our"
412,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",thoughts to represent it? Whence comes the value of this unattainable
413,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",truth? From an ideal of human reason. We covet truth. So that the
414,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",attempt to surrender all human science as relative and all human ideals
415,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",as trivial is founded on a blind belief in one human idea and an
416,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",absolute surrender to one human passion.
417,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",
418,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","In spite of these contradictions, which only a dispassionate logic"
419,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","could thoroughly unravel, the enthusiast is apt to rush on. The vision"
420,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","of absolute truth and absolute reality intoxicates him, and as he"
421,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","is too subtle a thinker, too inward a man, to accept the content of"
422,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",his senses or the conventions of his intelligence for unqualified
423,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","verities, he fortifies himself against them with the consciousness of"
424,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","their relativity, and seeks to rise above them in his meditations."
425,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","But to rise to what? To some more elaborate idea? To some object,"
426,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","like a scientific cosmos or a religious creed, put together by longer"
427,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",and more indirect processes than those of common perception? Surely
428,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",not. If I renounce my senses and vulgar intellect because they are
429,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","infected with finitude and smell of humanity, how shall I accept"
430,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","a work of art, a product of reasoning, or an idol made originally"
431,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","with hands and now encrusted all over, like the statue of Glaucus,"
432,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","with traditional accretions? Poetry, science, and religion, in their"
433,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","positive constructions, are more human, more conditioned, than are the"
434,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",senses and the common understanding themselves. The lover of inviolate
435,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",reality must not look to them. If the data of human knowledge must be
436,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","rejected as subjective, how much more should we reject the inferences"
437,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","made from those data by human thought. The way of true wisdom,"
438,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","therefore, if true wisdom is to deal with the Absolute, can only lie"
439,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","in abstention: neither the senses nor the common understanding, and"
440,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","much less the superstructure raised upon these by imagination, logic,"
441,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","or tradition, must delude us: we must keep our thoughts fixed upon the"
442,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","inanity of all this in comparison with the unthinkable truth, with the"
443,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","undivided and unimaginable reality. Everything, says the mystic, is"
444,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","nothing, in comparison with the One."
445,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",
446,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","This confusion, the logical contradiction of which we have just seen,"
447,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","may, for lack of a more specific word, be called mysticism. It consists"
448,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",in the surrender of a category of thought on account of the discovery
449,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","of its relativity. If I saw or reasoned or judged by such a category,"
450,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","I should be seeing, reasoning, or judging in a specific manner, in"
451,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",a manner conditioned by my finite nature. But the specific and the
452,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","finite, I feel, are odious; let me therefore aspire to see, reason and"
453,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","judge in no specific or finite manner--that is, not to see, reason or"
454,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","judge at all. So I shall be like the Infinite, nay I shall become one"
455,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",with the Infinite and (marvellous thought!) one with the One.
456,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",
457,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",The ideal of mysticism is accordingly exactly contrary to the ideal
458,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",of reason; instead of perfecting human nature it seeks to abolish it;
459,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","instead of building a better world, it would undermine the foundations"
460,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",even of the world we have built already; instead of developing our mind
461,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","to greater scope and precision, it would return to the condition of"
462,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",protoplasm--to the blessed consciousness of an Unutterable Reality. In
463,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","the primary stages, of course, mysticism does not venture to abolish"
464,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","all our ideas, or to renounce all our categories of thought. Thus many"
465,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","Christian mystics have still clung, out of respect for authority,"
466,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","to traditional theology, and many philosophical mystics have made"
467,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","some room for life and science in the post-scripts which they, like"
468,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","Parmenides, have appended to the blank monism of their systems. But"
469,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",such concessions or hesitations are inconsistent with the mystical
470,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","spirit which will never be satisfied, if fully developed and fearless,"
471,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",with anything short of Absolute Nothing.
472,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",
473,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","For the very reason, however, that mysticism is a tendency to"
474,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","obliterate distinctions, a partial mysticism often serves to bring"
475,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",out with wonderful intensity those underlying strata of experience
476,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",which it has not yet decomposed. The razing of the edifice of reason
477,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",may sometimes discover its foundations. Or the disappearance of one
478,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",department of activity may throw the mind with greater energy into
479,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","another. So Spinoza, who combined mysticism in morals with rationalism"
480,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","in science, can bring out the unqualified naturalism of his system"
481,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",with a purity and impressiveness impossible to men who still retain an
482,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","ideal world, and seek to direct endeavour as well as to describe it."
483,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","Having renounced all ideal categories, Spinoza has only the material"
484,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",categories left with which to cover the ground. He thus acquires all
485,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","the concentrated intensity, all the splendid narrowness, which had"
486,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","belonged to Lucretius, while his mystical treatment of the spheres"
487,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","which Lucretius simply ignored, gives him the appearance of a greater"
488,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","profundity. So an ordinary Christian who is mystical, let us say,"
489,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","about time and space, may use his transcendentalism in that sphere to"
490,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","intensify his positivism in theology, and to emphasize his whole-souled"
491,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",surrender to a devout life.
492,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",
493,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","What is impossible is to be a transcendentalist ""all 'round."" In that"
494,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",case there would be nothing left to transcend; the civil war of the
495,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",mind would have ended in the extermination of all parties. The art of
496,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",mysticism is to be mystical in spots and to aim the heavy guns of your
497,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",transcendental philosophy against those realities or those ideas which
498,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","you find particularly galling. Planted on your dearest dogma, on your"
499,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","most precious postulate, you may then transcend everything else to your"
500,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",heart's content. You may say with an air of enlightened profundity
501,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","that nothing is ""really"" right or wrong, because in Nature all things"
502,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","are regular and necessary, and God cannot act for purposes as if"
503,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",his will were not already accomplished; your mysticism in religion
504,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","and morals is kept standing, as it were, by the stiff backing which"
505,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",is furnished by your materialistic cosmology. Or you may say with a
506,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",tone of devout rapture that all sights and sounds are direct messages
507,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","from Divine Providence to the soul, without any objects ""really"""
508,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",existing in space; your mysticism about the world of perception and
509,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",scientific inference is sustained by the naive theological dogmas
510,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",which you substitute for the conceptions of common sense. Yet among
511,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",these partialities and blind denials a man's positive insight seems to
512,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","thrive, and he fortifies and concentrates himself on his chosen ground"
513,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",by his arbitrary exclusions. The patient art of rationalizing the
514,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","various sides of life, the observational as well as the moral, without"
515,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","confusing them, is an art apparently seldom given to the haste and"
516,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",pugnacity of philosophers.
517,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",
518,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","Thus mysticism, although a principle of dissolution, carries with it"
519,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",the safeguard that it can never be consistently applied. We reach it
520,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","only in exceptional moments of intuition, from which we descend to our"
521,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",pots and pans with habits and instincts virtually unimpaired. Life goes
522,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","on; virtues and affections endure, none the worse, the mystic feels,"
523,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",for that slight film of unreality which envelops them in a mind not
524,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","unacquainted with ecstasy. And although mysticism, left free to express"
525,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","itself, can have no other goal than Nirvana, yet moderately indulged"
526,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","in and duly inhibited by a residuum of conventional sanity, it serves"
527,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",to give a touch of strangeness and elevation to the character and to
528,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","suggest superhuman gifts. It is not, however, in the least superhuman."
529,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","It is hardly even abnormal, being only an exaggeration of a rational"
530,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","interest in the highest abstractions. The divine, the universal, the"
531,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","absolute, even the One, are legitimate conceptions. They are terms"
532,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",of human thought having as such a meaning in language and a place
533,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","in speculation. Those who live in the mind, whose passions are only"
534,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","audible in the keen overtones of dialectic, are no doubt exalted and"
535,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","privileged natures, choosing a better part which should not be taken"
536,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",from them. So the poet and the mathematician have their spheres of
537,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","abstract and delicate labour, in which a liberal legislator would not"
538,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",disturb them. Trouble only arises when the dialectician represents
539,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","his rational dreams as knowledge of existences, and the mystic his"
540,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",excusable raptures as the only way of life. Poets and mathematicians do
541,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",not imagine that their pursuits raise them above human limitations and
542,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","are no part of human life, but rather its only goal and justification."
543,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",Such a pretension would be regarded as madness in the mathematician
544,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",or the poet; and is not the mystic as miserably a man? Is he not
545,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","embodying, at his best, the analytic power of a logician, or the"
546,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","imagination of an enthusiast, and, at his worst, the lowest and most"
547,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",obscure passions of human nature?
548,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",
549,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","Yes, in spite of himself, the mystic remains human. Nothing is"
550,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",more normal than abstraction. A contemplative mind drops easily
551,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","its practical preoccupations, rises easily into an ideal sympathy"
552,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",with impersonal things. The wheels of the universe have a wonderful
553,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",magnetism for the human will. Our consciousness likes to lose itself
554,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","in the music of the spheres, a music that finer ears are sometimes"
555,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",privileged to catch. The better side of mysticism is an æsthetic
556,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",interest in large unities and cosmic laws. The æsthetic attitude is
557,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","not the moral, but it is not for that reason illegitimate. It gives us"
558,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",refreshment and a foretaste of that perfect adaptation of things to
559,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","our faculties and of our faculties to things which, could it extend"
560,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","to every part of experience, would constitute the ideal life. Such"
561,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",happiness is denied us in the concrete; but a hint and example of it
562,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",may be gathered by an abstracted element of our nature as it travels
563,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",through an abstracted world. Such an indulgence adds to the value of
564,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",reality only such value as it may itself have in momentary experience;
565,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",it may have a doubtful moral effect on the happy dreamer himself. But
566,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","it serves to keep alive the conviction, which a confused experience"
567,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","might obscure, that perfection is essentially possible; it reminds"
568,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","us, like music, that there are worlds far removed from the actual"
569,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",which are yet living and very near to the heart. Such is the fruit
570,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",of abstraction when abstraction bears any fruit. If the imagination
571,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","merely alienates us from reality, without giving us either a model for"
572,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","its correction or a glimpse into its structure, it becomes the refuge"
573,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","of poetical selfishness. Such selfishness is barren, and the fancy,"
574,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","feeding only on itself, grows leaner every day. Mysticism is usually an"
575,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","incurable disease. Facts cannot arouse it, since it never denied them."
576,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","Reason cannot convince it, for reason is a human faculty, assuming a"
577,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",validity which it cannot prove. The only thing that can kill mysticism
578,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","is its own uninterrupted progress, by which it gradually devours every"
579,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","function of the soul and at last, by destroying its own natural basis,"
580,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",immolates itself to its inexorable ideal.
581,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",
582,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","Need we ask, after all these reflections, where we should look for"
583,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",that expansion and elevation of the mind which the mystic seeks so
584,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","passionately and so unintelligently? We can find that expansion, in"
585,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","the first place, in the imagination itself. That is the true realm of"
586,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","man's infinity, where novelty may exist without falsity and perpetual"
587,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",diversity without contradiction. But such exercise of imagination
588,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",leaves the world of knowledge untouched. Is there no escape from the
589,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","prison, as the mystic thinks it, of science and history which shall"
590,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",yet not carry us beyond reality? Is there no truth beyond conventional
591,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","truth, no life behind human existence?"
592,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",
593,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","Certainly. Behind the discovered there is the discoverable, beyond"
594,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","the actual, the possible. Science and history are not exhausted. In"
595,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",their determinate directions they are as infinite as fancy in its
596,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",indetermination. The spectacle which science and history now spread
597,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",before us is as far beyond the experience of an ephemeral insect as any
598,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",Absolute can be beyond our own; yet we have put that spectacle together
599,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",out of just such sensations as the insect may have--out of this
600,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",sunlight and this buzz and these momentary throbs of existence. The
601,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","understanding has indeed supervened, but it has supervened not to deny"
602,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","the validity of those sensations, but to combine their messages. We may"
603,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","still continue in the same path, by the indefinite extension of science"
604,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",over a world of experience and of intelligible truth. Is that prospect
605,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",insufficient for our ambition? With a world so full of stuff before
606,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","him, I can hardly conceive what morbid instinct can tempt a man to look"
607,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","elsewhere for wider vistas, unless it be unwillingness to endure the"
608,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",sadness and the discipline of the truth.
609,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",
610,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",But can our situation be made better by refusing to understand it? If
611,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","we renounced mysticism altogether and kept imagination in its place,"
612,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","should we not live in a clearer and safer world, as well as in a"
613,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","truer? Nay, are we sure that this gradually unfolding, intelligible,"
614,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",and real world would not turn out to be more congenial and beautiful
615,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","than any wilful fiction, since it would be the product of a universal"
616,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",human labour and the scene of the accumulated sufferings and triumphs
617,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","of mankind? When we compare the temple which we call Nature, built of"
618,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","sights and sounds by memory and understanding, with all the wonderful"
619,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","worlds evocable by the magician's wand, may we not prefer the humbler"
620,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","and more lasting edifice, not only as a dwelling, but even as a house"
621,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",of prayer? It is not always the loftiest architecture that expresses
622,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",the deepest soul; the inmost religion of the Pagan haunted his
623,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",hearth as that of the Christian his catacombs or his hermitage. So
624,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",philosophy is more spiritual in her humility and abstinence than in
625,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","her short-lived audacities, and she would do well to inscribe over her"
626,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","gates what, in an ancient Spanish church, may be seen written near the"
627,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",steep entrance to a little subterraneous crypt:--
628,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",
629,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","""Wouldst thou pass this lowly door?"
630,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","Go, and angels greet thee there;"
631,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",For by this their sacred stair
632,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",To descend is still to soar.
633,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",Bid a measured silence keep
634,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM",What thy thoughts be telling o'er;
635,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","Sink, to rise with wider sweep"
636,"UNDERSTANDING, IMAGINATION, AND MYSTICISM","To the heaven of thy rest,"

647,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
648,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
649,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,We of this generation look back upon a variety of religious conceptions
650,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"and forms of worship, and a certain unsatisfied hunger in our own souls"
651,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,attaches our attention to the spectacle. We observe how literally
652,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,fables and mysteries were once accepted which can have for us now only
653,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,a thin and symbolical meaning. Judging other minds and other ages
654,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"by our own, we are tempted to ask if there ever was any fundamental"
655,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,difference between religion and poetry. Both seem to consist in what
656,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"the imagination adds to science, to history, and to morals. Men looked"
657,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,attentively on the face of Nature: their close struggle with her
658,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,compelled them to do so: but before making statistics of her movements
659,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,they made dramatizations of her life. The imagination enveloped the
660,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"material world, as yet imperfectly studied, and produced the cosmos of"
661,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,mythology.
662,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
663,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Thus the religion of the Greeks was, we might say, nothing but poetry:"
664,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"nothing but what imagination added to the rudiments of science, to"
665,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,the first impressions of a mind that pored upon natural phenomena and
666,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,responded to them with a quick sense of kinship and comprehension.
667,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,The religion of the Hebrews might be called poetry with as good
668,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"reason. Their ""sense for conduct"" and their vivid interest in their"
669,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,national destiny carried them past any prosaic record of events or
670,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,cautious theory of moral and social laws. They rose at once into a
671,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,bold dramatic conception of their race's covenant with Heaven: just
672,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,such a conception as the playwright would seek out in order to portray
673,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"with awful acceleration the ways of passion and fate. Finally, we have"
674,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,apparently a third kind of poetry in what has been the natural religion
675,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,of the detached philosophers of all ages. In them the imagination
676,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"touches the precepts of morals and the ideals of reason, attributing"
677,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,to them a larger scope and more perfect fulfilment than experience can
678,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,show them to have. Philosophers ever tend to clothe the harmonies of
679,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,their personal thought with universal validity and to assign to their
680,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,ideals a latent omnipotence and an ultimate victory over the forces of
681,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,unreason. This which is obviously a kind of poetry is at the same time
682,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,the spontaneous religion of conscience and thought.
683,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
684,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Yet religion in all these cases differs from a mere play of the
685,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,imagination in one important respect; it reacts directly upon life;
686,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,it is a factor in conduct. Our religion is the poetry in which we
687,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"believe. Mere poetry is an ineffectual shadow of life; religion is,"
688,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"if you will, a phantom also, but a phantom guide. While it tends to"
689,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"its own expansion, like any growth in the imagination, it tends also"
690,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,to its application in practice. Such an aim is foreign to poetry. The
691,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,inspirations of religion demand fidelity and courageous response on
692,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"our part. Faith brings us not only peace, not only the contemplation"
693,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"of ideal harmonies, but labour and the sword. These two tendencies--to"
694,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,imaginative growth and to practical embodiment--coexist in every
695,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"living religion, but they are not always equally conspicuous. In the"
696,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"formative ages of Christianity, for instance, while its legends were"
697,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"being gathered and its dogma fixed, the imaginative expansion absorbed"
698,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"men's interest; later, when the luxuriant branches of the Church began"
699,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"to shake off their foliage, and there came a time of year"
700,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
701,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"""When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang"
702,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,"""
703,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
704,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"the energy of religious thought, released from the enlargement of"
705,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"doctrine, spent itself upon a more rigid and watchful application of"
706,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,the residuum of faith.
707,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
708,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,In the Pagan religion the element of applicability might seem at first
709,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"sight to be lacking, so that nothing would subsist but a poetic fable."
710,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"An unbiassed study of antiquity, however, will soon dispel that idea."
711,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Besides the gods whom we may plausibly regard as impersonations of
712,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"natural forces, there existed others; the spirits of ancestors, the"
713,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"gods of the hearth, and the ideal patrons of war and the arts. Even the"
714,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,gods of Nature inspired reverence and secured a cultus only as they
715,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,influenced the well-being of man. The worship of them had a practical
716,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,import. The conception of their nature and presence became a sanction
717,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,and an inspiration in the conduct of life. When the figments of the
718,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,fancy are wholly divorced from reality they can have no clearness or
719,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,consistency; they can have no permanence when they are wholly devoid of
720,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,utility. The vividness and persistence of the figures of many of the
721,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,gods came from the fact that they were associated with institutions and
722,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,practices which controlled the conception of them and kept it young.
723,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"The fictions of a poet, whatever his genius, do not produce illusion"
724,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,because they do not attach themselves to realities in the world of
725,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,action. They have character without power and names without local
726,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"habitations. The gods in the beginning had both. Their image, their"
727,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"haunts, the reports of their apparitions and miracles, gave a nucleus"
728,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,of empirical reality to the accretions of legend. The poet who came
729,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"to sing their praise, to enlarge upon their exploits, and to explain"
730,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"their cultus, gave less to the gods in honour than he received from"
731,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,them in inspiration. All his invention was guided by the genius of the
732,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"deity, as represented by the traditions of his shrine. This poetry,"
733,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"then, even in its most playful mood, is not mere poetry, but religion."
734,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,It is a poetry in which men believe; it is a poetry that beautifies and
735,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"justifies to their minds the positive facts of their ancestral worship,"
736,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"their social unity, and their personal conscience."
737,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
738,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,These general reflections may help us to approach the hymns of Homer
739,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"in a becoming spirit. For in them we find the extreme of fancy, the"
740,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,approach to a divorce between the imagination and the faith of the
741,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,worshipper. Consequently there is danger that we may allow ourselves
742,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,to read these lives of the gods as the composition of a profane poet.
743,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,If we did so we should fail to understand not only their spirit as
744,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"a whole but many of their parts, in which notes are struck now of"
745,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"devotion and affectionate pride, now of gratitude and entreaty. These"
746,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"may be addressed, it is true, to a being that has just been described"
747,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"as guilty of some signal vice or treachery, and the contradiction may"
748,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,well stagger a Puritan critic. But the lusts of life were once for
749,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"all in the blood of the Pagan gods, who were the articulate voices of"
750,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Nature and of passion. The half-meant exaggeration of a well-known
751,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,trait in the divinity would not render the poets that indulged in it
752,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,unwelcome to the god; he could feel the sure faith and affection of
753,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,his worshippers even in their good-humoured laughter at his imaginary
754,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,plights and naughtiness. The clown was not excluded from these rites.
755,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,His wit also counted as a service.
756,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
757,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"The Homeric Hymns, if we may trust the impression they produce on"
758,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"a modern, are not hymns and are not Homer's. They are fragments of"
759,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,narrative in Ionic hexameter recited during the feasts and fairs at
760,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,various Greek shrines. They are not melodies to be chanted with a
761,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,common voice by the assemblage during a sacrifice; they are tales
762,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,delivered by the minstrel to the listening audience of citizens and
763,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,strangers. They usually have a local reference. Thus we find under the
764,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,title of a hymn to Apollo a song of Delos and one of Delphi. Delos is
765,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,a barren rock; its wealth was due to the temple that attracted to the
766,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"place pilgrimages and embassies, not without rich offerings, from many"
767,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Greek cities. Accordingly we hear how Leto or Latona, when about to"
768,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"become the mother of Apollo, wandered about the cities and mountains"
769,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"of Greece and Asia, seeking a birthplace for her son. None would"
770,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"receive her, but all the islands trembled at the awful honour of such a"
771,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"nativity, profitable as the honour might eventually prove,--"
772,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
773,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"""Until at length"
774,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,The lovely goddess came to Delos' side
775,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"And, making question, spake these wingèd words:"
776,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"'Delos, were it thy will to be the seat"
777,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Of my young son Apollo, brightest god,"
778,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"And build him a rich fane, no other power"
779,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Should ever touch thee or work ill upon thee.
780,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,I tell thee not thou shalt be rich in kine
781,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Or in fair flocks, much fruit, or myriad flowers;"
782,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,But when Apollo of the far-felt dart
783,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Hath here his shrine, all men will gather here"
784,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Bringing thee hecatombs.... And though thy soil be poor,"
785,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"The gods shall make thee strong against thy foes.'"""
786,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
787,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,The spirit of the island is naturally not averse to so favourable a
788,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"proposition but, like some too humble maiden wooed by a great prince,"
789,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,has some misgivings lest this promise of unexpected good fortune should
790,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"veil the approach of some worse calamity. ""When the god is born into"
791,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"the light of day,"" she says, ""will he not despise me, seeing how barren"
792,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"I am, and sink me in the sea"
793,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
794,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"""That ever will"
795,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Oppress my heart with many a watery hill?
796,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"And therefore let him choose some other land,"
797,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Where he shall please, to build at his command"
798,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Temple and grove set thick with many a tree.
799,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"For wretched polypuses breed in me,"
800,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Retiring chambers, and black sea-calves den"
801,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"In my poor soil, for penury of men.""[1]"
802,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
803,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Leto reassures the island, however, and swears to build a great"
804,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"temple there which her son will haunt perpetually, preferring it to"
805,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"all his other shrines. Delos consents, and Apollo is born amid the"
806,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"ministrations of all the goddesses except Hera, who sits indignant"
807,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,and revengeful in the solitudes of Olympus. The child is bathed in
808,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,the stream and delicately swaddled; but after tasting the nectar and
809,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"ambrosia which one of the nymphs is quick to offer him, he bursts his"
810,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"bands, calls for his bow and his lyre, and flies upward into the sky"
811,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,announcing that he will henceforth declare the will of Zeus to mortals.
812,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Thereupon--
813,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
814,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"""All the immortals stood"
815,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,In deep amaze....
816,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"All Delos, looking on him, all with gold"
817,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Was loaded straight, and joy'd to be extoll'd."
818,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"For so she flourished, as a hill that stood"
819,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Crown'd with the flower of an abundant wood.""[2]"
820,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
821,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"This legend, with all that accompanies it concerning the glories of"
822,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Delos and its gods, and the pilgrimages and games that enlivened the"
823,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"island, was well-conceived to give form and justification to the"
824,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"cultus of the temple, and to delight the votaries whom custom or vague"
825,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"instincts of piety had gathered there. The sacred poet, in another part"
826,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"of this hymn, does the same service to the even greater sanctuary of"
827,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Delphi. He tells us how Apollo wandered over many lands and waters,"
828,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,and he stops lovingly to recall the names of the various spots that
829,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,claimed the honour of having at some time been visited by the god.
830,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"The minstrels, wanderers themselves, loved to celebrate in this way"
831,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"the shores they had seen or heard of, and to fill at the same time"
832,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"their listener's minds with the spell of sonorous names, the sense of"
833,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"space and the thrill of mystery. In his journeys Apollo, the hymn tells"
834,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"us, finally came to the dell and fountain of Delphusa on the skirts"
835,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"of Parnassus. The nymph of the spot, fearing the encroachments of so"
836,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"much more powerful a deity, deceived him and persuaded him to plant"
837,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"his temple on another site, where Parnassus fronts the west, and the"
838,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,overhanging rocks form a cavern. There Apollo established his temple
839,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"for the succour and enlightenment of mankind, while Trophonius and"
840,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Agamedes, sons of Erginus, men dear to the immortal gods, built the"
841,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,approaches of stone.
842,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
843,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Thus the divine origin of the temple is vindicated, the structure"
844,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"described, and the human architects honoured, whose descendants,"
845,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"very likely, were present to hear their ancestors' praise. But here"
846,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,a puzzling fact challenges the attention and stimulates the fancy of
847,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"the poet: Apollo was a Dorian deity, yet his chief shrine was here"
848,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,upon Phocian ground. Perhaps some traditions remained to suggest an
849,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,explanation of the anomaly; at any rate the poet is not at a loss
850,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"for an account of the matter. The temple being established, Apollo"
851,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,bethought himself what race of priests he should make its ministers:
852,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"at least, such is the naïve account in the poem, which expects us"
853,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,to forget that temples do not arise in the absence of predetermined
854,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"servants and worshippers. While pondering this question, however,"
855,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Apollo cast his eyes on the sea where it chanced that a swift ship,"
856,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"manned by many and excellent Cretans, was merrily sailing: whereupon"
857,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"the god, taking the form of a huge dolphin, leapt into the ship, to the"
858,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"infinite surprise and bewilderment of those worthy merchants, who, as"
859,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,innocent as the fishers of the Galilæan Lake of the religious destiny
860,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"that awaited them, were thinking only of the pecuniary profits of their"
861,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"voyage. The presence of the god benumbed their movements, and they"
862,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"stood silent while the ship sailed before the wind. And the blast,"
863,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"veering at this place with the changed configuration of the coast, blew"
864,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"them irresistibly to the very foot of Parnassus, to the little haven of"
865,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Crissa. There Apollo appeared to them once more, this time running down"
866,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,to the beach to meet them in the form of
867,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
868,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"""A stout and lusty fellow,"
869,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,His mighty shoulders covered with his mane;
870,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Who sped these words upon the wings of sound:
871,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"'Strangers, who are ye? and whence sail ye hither"
872,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,The watery ways? Come ye to traffic justly
873,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Or recklessly like pirates of the deep
874,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Rove ye, adventuring your souls, to bring"
875,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Evil on strangers? Why thus sit ye grieving,"
876,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Nor leap on land, nor strike the mast and lay it"
877,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,In your black ship? For so should traders do
878,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"When, sated with the labour of the sea,"
879,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"They quit their painted galley for the shore,"
880,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,And presently the thought of needful food
881,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Comes gladsomely upon them.' So he spake,"
882,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Putting new courage in their breasts. To whom
883,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,The Cretan captain in his turn replied:
884,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,'Since thou art nothing like to things of earth
885,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"In form or stature, but most like the gods"
886,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"That ever live, Hail, and thrice hail, O Stranger,"
887,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,And may the gods pour blessings on thy head.
888,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Now tell me truly, for I need to know,"
889,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"What land is this, what people, from what race"
890,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Descended? As for us, over the deep"
891,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Broad sea, we sought another haven, Pylos,"
892,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Sailing from Crete, for thence we boast to spring;"
893,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"But now our ship is cast upon this shore,"
894,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,For some god steered our course against our will.'
895,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Then the far-darter spoke and answered them.
896,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"'Friends, in well-wooded Cnossus hitherto"
897,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Ye have had homes, but ye shall not again"
898,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Return to your good native town, to find"
899,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Each his fair house and well-belovèd wife,"
900,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"But here shall ye possess my temple, rich"
901,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,And greatly honoured by the tribes of men.
902,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,For I am son to Zeus. Apollo is
903,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,My sacred name. 'Twas I that led you hither
904,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Over the mighty bosom of the deep,"
905,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Intending you no ill; for ye shall here
906,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Possess a temple sacred to me, rich,"
907,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,And greatly honoured of all mortal men.
908,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,The counsels of the deathless gods shall be
909,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Revealed to you, and by their will your days"
910,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Shall pass in honour and in peace for ever.
911,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Come then and, as I bid, make haste to do."
912,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,... Build by the sea an altar; kindle flame;
913,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Sprinkle white barley grains thereon, and pray,"
914,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Standing about the altar. And as first
915,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Ye saw me leap into your swift black bark
916,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"In likeness of a dolphin, so henceforth"
917,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Worship me by the name Delphinius,"
918,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"And Delphian ever be my far-seen shrine.'"""
919,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
920,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Thus the establishment of the Dorian god in Phocis is explained, and"
921,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,the wealth and dignity of his temple are justified by prophecy and
922,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,by divine intention. For Apollo is not satisfied with repeatedly
923,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"describing the future temple, by an incidental epithet, as opulent;"
924,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,that hint would not have been enough for the simplicity of those
925,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"merchant sailors, new as they were to the mysteries of priestcraft."
926,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,It was necessary for Apollo to allay their fears of poverty by a more
927,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,explicit assurance that it will be easy for them to live by the altar.
928,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"And what is more, Hermes and all the thieves he inspires will respect"
929,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"the shrine; its treasures, although unprotected by walls, shall be safe"
930,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,for-ever.
931,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
932,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"These were truly, as we see, the hymns of a levitical patriotism. With"
933,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Homeric breadth and candour they dilated on the miracles, privileges,"
934,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"and immunities of the sacred places and their servitors, and they thus"
935,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,kept alive in successive generations an awe mingled with familiar
936,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,interest toward divine persons and things which is characteristic of
937,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"that more primitive age. Gods and men were then nearer together, and"
938,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"both yielded more frankly to the tendency, inherent in their nature, to"
939,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,resemble one another.
940,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
941,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"The same quality is found in another fragment, the most beautiful and"
942,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,the most familiar of all. This is the hymn to Demeter in which two
943,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"stories are woven together, one telling of the rape of Persephone, and"
944,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"the other of the reception of Demeter, disguised in her sorrow, into"
945,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"the household of Celeus, where she becomes the nurse of his infant son"
946,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Demophoon. Both stories belong to the religion of Eleusis, where this"
947,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,version of them seems intended to be sung. The place was sacred to
948,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Demeter and Persephone and its mysteries dealt particularly with the
949,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,passage of souls to the nether world and with their habitation there.
950,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,The pathetic beauty of the first fable--in which we can hardly abstain
951,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,from seeing some symbolical meaning--expresses for us something of the
952,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"mystic exaltation of the local rites; while the other tale of Celeus,"
953,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"his wife, his daughters, and his son, whom his nurse, the disguised"
954,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"goddess, almost succeeds in endowing with immortality, celebrates the"
955,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,ancient divine affinities of the chiefs of the Eleusinian state.
956,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
957,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,The first story is too familiar to need recounting; who has not heard
958,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,of the gentle Persephone gathering flowers in the meadow and suddenly
959,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"swallowed by the yawning earth and carried away to Hades, the god of"
960,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"the nether world, to share his sombre but sublime dominion over the"
961,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"shades?--a dignity of which she is not insensible, much as she grieves"
962,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,at the separation from her beloved mother; and how Demeter in turn
963,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,is disconsolate and (in her wrath and despair at the indifference of
964,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"the gods) conceals her divinity, refuses the fruits of the earth, and"
965,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"wanders about in the guise of an old woman, nursing her grief, until"
966,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,at last Zeus sends his messenger to Hades to effect a compromise; and
967,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Persephone, after eating the grain of pomegranate that obliges her to"
968,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"return yearly to her husband, is allowed to come back to the upper"
969,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,world to dwell for two-thirds of the year in her mother's company.
970,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
971,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,The underlying allegory is here very interesting. We observe how the
972,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"genius of the Greek religion, while too anthropomorphic to retain any"
973,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,clear consciousness of the cosmic processes that were symbolized by its
974,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"deities and their adventures, was anthropomorphic also in a moral way,"
975,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,and tended to turn the personages which it ceased to regard as symbols
976,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,of natural forces into types of human experience. So the parable of
977,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"the seed that must die if it is to rise again and live an immortal, if"
978,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"interrupted, life in successive generations, gives way in the tale of"
979,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Demeter and Persephone, to a prototype of human affection. The devotee,"
980,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"no longer reminded by his religion of any cosmic laws, was not reduced"
981,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"to a mere superstition,--to a fable and a belief in the efficacy of"
982,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"external rites,--he was encouraged to regard the mystery as the"
983,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,divine counterpart of his own experience. His religion in forgetting
984,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,to be natural had succeeded in becoming moral; the gods were now
985,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,models of human endurance and success; their histories offered sublime
986,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,consolations to mortal destiny. Fancy had turned the aspects of Nature
987,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"into persons; but devotion, directed upon these imaginary persons,"
988,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"turned them into human ideals and into patron saints, thereby relating"
989,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,them again to life and saving them from insignificance.
990,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
991,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,A further illustration of the latter transformation may be found in the
992,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"second story contained in our hymn. Demeter, weary of her wanderings"
993,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"and sick at heart, has come to sit down beside a well, near the house"
994,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"of Celeus. His four young daughters, dancing and laughing, come to"
995,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"fetch water in their golden jars,--"
996,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
997,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"""As hinds or heifers gambol in the fields"
998,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"When Spring is young."""
999,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1000,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"They speak kindly to the goddess, who asks them for employment. ""And"
1001,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"for me,"" she says,--"
1002,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1003,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"""And for me, damsels, harbour pitiful"
1004,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"And favouring thoughts, dear children, that I come"
1005,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"To some good man's or woman's house, to ply"
1006,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,My task in willing service of such sort
1007,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,As agèd women use. A tender child
1008,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"I could nurse well and safely in my arms,"
1009,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"And tend the house, and spread the master's couch"
1010,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Recessed in the fair chamber, or could teach"
1011,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"The maids their handicraft."""
1012,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1013,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"The offer is gladly accepted, for Celeus himself has an infant son,"
1014,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Demophoon, the hope of his race: The aged woman enters the dwelling,"
1015,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,making in her long-robed grief a wonderful contrast to the four
1016,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,sportive girls:--
1017,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1018,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"""Who lifting up their ample kirtle-folds"
1019,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Sped down the waggon-furrowed way, and shook"
1020,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Their curls about their shoulders--yellow gold
1021,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Like crocuses in bloom."""
1022,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1023,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Once within the house, which she awes with her uncomprehended presence,"
1024,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"the goddess sits absorbed in grief, until she is compelled to smile"
1025,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"for a moment at the jests of the quick-witted maid Iambe, and consents"
1026,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"to take in lieu of the wine that is offered her, a beverage of beaten"
1027,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"barley, water, and herbs. These details are of course introduced to"
1028,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"justify the ritual of Eleusis, in which the clown and the barley-water"
1029,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,played a traditional part.
1030,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1031,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Thus Demeter becomes nurse to Demophoon, but she has ideas of"
1032,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"her duties differing from the common, and worthy of her unusual"
1033,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,qualifications. She neither suckles nor feeds the infant but anoints
1034,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,him with ambrosia and lays him at night to sleep on the embers of the
1035,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,hearth. This his watchful mother discovers with not unnatural alarm;
1036,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"when the goddess reveals herself and departs, foiled in her desire to"
1037,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,make her nursling immortal.
1038,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1039,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,The spirit that animates this fable is not that poetic frivolity which
1040,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,we are accustomed to associate with Paganism. Here we find an immortal
1041,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,in profoundest grief and mortals entertaining an angel unawares; we are
1042,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"told of supernatural food, and of a burning fire that might make this"
1043,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,mortal put on immortality did not the generous but ignorant impulses of
1044,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,the natural man break in upon that providential purpose and prevent its
1045,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"consummation. Eleusis was the natural home for such a myth, and we may"
1046,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,well believe that those initiated into the mysteries there were taught
1047,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,to dwell on its higher interpretation.
1048,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1049,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,But there are other hymns in a lighter vein in which the play of
1050,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,fancy is not guided by any moral intuition. The hymn to Hermes is one
1051,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,perpetual ebullition of irresponsible humour.
1052,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1053,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Hermes is the child of Maia, a nymph of Cyllene whose cave Zeus has"
1054,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"surreptitiously visited while the white-armed Juno--for, unsympathetic"
1055,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"prude as this goddess may be, she must still be beautiful--slept"
1056,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,soundly in Olympus. The child is hardly born when he catches a
1057,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"tortoise, kills it, scoops out the shell, and makes a lute of it, upon"
1058,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"which he begins to play delicious music. Not satisfied with that feat,"
1059,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"however, he escapes from his cradle, and drives from their pasture"
1060,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,the kine that Apollo has left feeding there. Accused afterward of this
1061,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"mischief, he defends himself after the following fashion, while he lies"
1062,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"in his crib, holding his new-made lyre lightly in his hand under the"
1063,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,bedclothes. I quote Shelley's version:--
1064,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1065,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"""'An ox-stealer should be both tall and strong"
1066,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,And I am but a little new-born thing
1067,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Who yet, at least, can think of nothing wrong."
1068,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"My business is to suck, and sleep, and fling"
1069,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"The cradle-clothes about me all day long,"
1070,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Or, half-asleep, hear my sweet mother sing"
1071,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,And to be washed in water clean and warm
1072,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"And hushed and kissed and kept secure from harm.'"""
1073,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,*       *       *       *       *       *
1074,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"""Sudden he changed his plan, and with strange skill"
1075,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Subdued the strong Latonian, by the might"
1076,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Of winning music, to his mightier will."
1077,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"His left hand held the lyre, and in his right"
1078,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,The plectrum struck the chords: unconquerable
1079,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Up from beneath his hand in circling flight
1080,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,The gathering music rose--and sweet as Love
1081,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,The penetrating notes did live and move
1082,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1083,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"""Within the heart of great Apollo. He"
1084,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Listened with all his soul, and laughed for pleasure."
1085,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Close to his side stood harping fearlessly
1086,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"The unabashèd boy, and to the measure"
1087,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Of the sweet lyre there followed loud and free
1088,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,His joyous voice: for he unlocked the treasure
1089,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Of his deep song, illustrating the birth"
1090,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Of the bright Gods, and the dark desert Earth;"
1091,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1092,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"""And how to the Immortals every one"
1093,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,A portion was assigned of all that is.
1094,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,But chief Mnemosyne did Maia's son
1095,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Clothe in the light of his loud melodies.
1096,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"And, as each god was born or had begun,"
1097,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,He in their order due and fit degrees
1098,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Sung of his birth and being--and did move
1099,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Apollo to unutterable love."""
1100,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1101,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"In fact, after the most enthusiastic encomiums on the young god's art,"
1102,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"and on the power of music in general, Apollo offers the child his"
1103,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,protection and friendship:--
1104,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1105,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"""Now, since thou hast, although so very small,"
1106,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Science of arts so glorious, thus I swear,--"
1107,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"And let this cornel javelin, keen and tall,"
1108,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Witness between us what I promise here,--"
1109,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"That I will lead thee to the Olympian hall,"
1110,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Honoured and mighty, with thy mother dear,"
1111,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,And many glorious gifts in joy will give thee
1112,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"And even at the end will ne'er deceive thee."""
1113,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1114,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Hermes is not insensible to this offer and its advantages; he accepts
1115,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"it with good grace and many compliments, nor does he wish to remain"
1116,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,behind in the exchange of courtesies and benefits: he addresses Apollo
1117,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,thus:--
1118,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1119,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"""Thou canst seek out and compass all that wit"
1120,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Can find or teach. Yet, since thou wilt, come, take"
1121,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,The lyre--be mine the glory giving it--
1122,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Strike the sweet chords, and sing aloud, and wake"
1123,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,The joyous pleasure out of many a fit
1124,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Of tranced sound--and with fleet fingers make?
1125,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Thy liquid-voiced comrade speak with thee,--"
1126,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,It can talk measured music eloquently.
1127,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1128,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"""Then bear it boldly to the revel loud,"
1129,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Love-wakening dance, or feast of solemn state,"
1130,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,A joy by night or day: for those endowed
1131,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,With art and wisdom who interrogate
1132,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"It teaches, babbling in delightful mood"
1133,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,All things which make the spirit most elate.
1134,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Soothing the mind with sweet familiar play,"
1135,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Chasing the heavy shadows of dismay.
1136,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1137,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"""To those that are unskilled in its sweet tongue,"
1138,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Though they should question most impetuously
1139,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Its hidden soul, it gossips something wrong--"
1140,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Some senseless and impertinent reply.
1141,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"But thou, who art as wise as thou art strong,"
1142,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Canst compass all that thou desirest. I
1143,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Present thee with this music-flowing shell,"
1144,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Knowing thou canst interrogate it well...."""
1145,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1146,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Apollo is not slow to learn the new art with which he is ever after
1147,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,to delight both gods and men; but he is not at first quite at ease in
1148,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"his mind, fearing that Hermes will not only recapture the lyre but"
1149,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"steal his friend's bow and arrows into the bargain. Hermes, however,"
1150,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"swears by all that is holy never to do so, and the friendship of the"
1151,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"two artful gods is sealed for ever. The minstrel does not forget, at"
1152,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"this point, to remind his hearers, among whom we may imagine not a few"
1153,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"professional followers of Hermes to have been mixed, that the robber's"
1154,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,honour is pledged by his divine patron to respect the treasures of
1155,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Apollo's shrines. Let not the votary think, he adds, that Apollo's"
1156,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,oracles are equally useful to good and to bad men: these mysteries
1157,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,are truly efficacious only for the pious and orthodox who follow the
1158,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,established traditions of the temple and honour its servants. Apollo
1159,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,says:--
1160,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1161,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"""He who comes consigned"
1162,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,By voice and wings of perfect augury
1163,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,To my great shrine shall find avail in me:
1164,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1165,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"""Him I will not deceive, but will assist."
1166,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,But he who comes relying on such birds
1167,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"As chatter vainly, who would strain and twist"
1168,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"The purpose of the gods with idle words,"
1169,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"And deems their knowledge light, he shall have missed"
1170,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,His road--whilst I among my other hoards
1171,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"His gifts deposit...."""
1172,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1173,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,The wildest fairy-story thus leads easily to a little drama not
1174,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,without its human charm and moral inspiration; while the legend is
1175,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"attached to the cultus, and the cultus is intertwined with the practice"
1176,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"and sanctions of daily life. Even here, in its most playful mood,"
1177,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"therefore, this mythological poetry retains the spirit and function"
1178,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,of religion. Even here sacerdotal interests are not forgotten. Delphi
1179,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,shall be safe; the lyre is Apollo's by right although it be Hermes' by
1180,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,invention. A certain amiable harmony is after all drawn from the riot
1181,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"of foolishness. All is sweet and unmalicious and lovable enough, and"
1182,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"the patronage of both the friendly gods, the enthusiast and the wag,"
1183,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,may be invoked with confidence and benefit.
1184,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1185,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Not less remarkable, although for other reasons, is the hymn to"
1186,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Aphrodite. Here we find a more human fable and a more serious tone:
1187,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"while the poem, if we choose to consider it in its allegorical meaning,"
1188,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,touches one of the deepest convictions of the Greek conscience. All the
1189,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"gods save three--Athena, Artemis, and Hestia,--are subject to the power"
1190,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"of Aphrodite, Zeus at least as much as the rest. In revenge for this"
1191,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"subjection, Zeus determines to make Aphrodite feel the passion which"
1192,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,she boasts to be able to inspire in others.
1193,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1194,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"The fair shepherd Anchises feeds his flocks upon Mount Ida, and with"
1195,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,him Aphrodite is made to fall in love. She presents herself to him in a
1196,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"human disguise, and meets his advances with a long account of her birth"
1197,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"and parentage, and begs him to take her back to her parents, and having"
1198,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"asked for her hand and fulfilled all customary formalities, to lead her"
1199,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"away as his lawful wife. The passion which at the same time, however,"
1200,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,she is careful to breathe into him cannot brook so long a delay: and
1201,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,she yields to his impatience. When about to leave him she awakes him
1202,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"from his sleep, turns upon him the full glance of her divinity, and"
1203,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"reveals her name and his destiny. She will bear him a son, Æneas, who"
1204,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,will be one of the greatest princes and heroes of Troy; but he himself
1205,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"will be stricken with feebleness and a premature old age, in punishment"
1206,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,for the involuntary sacrilege which he has committed.
1207,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1208,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"The description of the disguised goddess, with its Homeric pomp and"
1209,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"elaborate propriety, is a noble and masterly one, underlined, as"
1210,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"it were, with a certain satirical or dramatic intention; we have"
1211,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"the directness of a Nausicaa, with a more luxurious and passionate"
1212,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"beauty. The revelation of the goddess is wonderfully made, with that"
1213,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,parallel movement of natural causes and divine workings which is so
1214,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,often to be admired in Homer. The divinity of the visitant appears
1215,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"only at the moment of her flight, when she becomes a consecration and"
1216,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"an unattainable memory. The sight of deity leaves the eyes dull, like"
1217,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,those of the Platonic prisoners returning from the sunlight of truth
1218,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"into the den of appearance. Nay more, a communion with the divinity,"
1219,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"closer than is consonant with human frailty, leaves the seer impotent"
1220,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,and a burden upon the world; but this personal tragedy is not without
1221,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"its noble fruits to posterity. Anchises suffers, but his son Æneas, the"
1222,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"issue of that divine though punishable union, lives to bear, not only"
1223,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"the aged Anchises himself, but the gods of Ilium, out of the ruins of"
1224,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Troy.
1225,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1226,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Such analogies carry us, no doubt, far beyond the intention of the hymn"
1227,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,or of the exoteric religion to which it ministers. The story-teller's
1228,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"delight in his story is the obvious motive of such compositions, even"
1229,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,when they reflect indirectly the awe in which the divine impersonations
1230,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,of natural forces were held by the popular religion. All that we may
1231,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,fairly imagine to have been in the mind of the pious singer is the
1232,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,sense that something divine comes down among us in the crises of our
1233,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"existence, and that this visitation is fraught with immense although"
1234,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"vague possibilities of both good and evil. The gods sometimes appear,"
1235,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,and when they do they bring us a foretaste of that sublime victory of
1236,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,mind over matter which we may never gain in experience but which may
1237,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,constantly be gained in thought. When natural phenomena are conceived
1238,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"as the manifestation of divine life, human life itself, by sympathy"
1239,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"with that ideal projection of itself, enlarges its customary bounds,"
1240,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,until it seems capable of becoming the life of the universe. A god
1241,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,is a conceived victory of mind over Nature. A visible god is the
1242,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,consciousness of such a victory momentarily attained. The vision soon
1243,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"vanishes, the sense of omnipotence is soon dispelled by recurring"
1244,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,conflicts with hostile forces; but the momentary illusion of that
1245,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,realized good has left us with the perennial knowledge of good as an
1246,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,ideal. Therein lies the essence and the function of religion.
1247,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1248,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"That such a function was fulfilled by this Homeric legend, with all its"
1249,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"love of myth and lust of visible beauty, is witnessed by another short"
1250,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"hymn, which we may quote almost entire by way of conclusion. It is"
1251,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"addressed to Castor and Polydeuces, patrons of sailors no less than of"
1252,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,horsemen and boxers. It is impossible to read it without feeling that
1253,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"the poet, however entangled he may have been in superstition and fable,"
1254,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,grasped that high essence of religion which makes religion rational. He
1255,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,felt the power of contemplation to master the contradictions of life
1256,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"and to overspread experience, sublime but impalpable, like a rainbow"
1257,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,over retreating storms:--
1258,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,
1259,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"""Ye wild-eyed Muses, sing the Twins of Jove"
1260,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"... Mild Pollux, void of blame,"
1261,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"And steed-subduing Castor, heirs of fame."
1262,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,These are the powers who earth-born mortals save
1263,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"And ships, whose flight is swift along the wave."
1264,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,When wintry tempests o'er the savage sea
1265,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Are raging, and the sailors tremblingly"
1266,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Call on the Twins of Jove with prayer and vow,"
1267,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"Gathered in fear upon the lofty prow,"
1268,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,And sacrifice with snow-white lambs--the wind
1269,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,And the huge billow bursting close behind
1270,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Even then beneath the weltering waters bear
1271,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"The staggering ship,--they suddenly appear,"
1272,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"On yellow wings rushing athwart the sky,"
1273,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,And lull the blasts in mute tranquillity
1274,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"And strew the waves on the white ocean's bed,"
1275,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,Fair omen of the voyage; from toil and dread
1276,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"The sailors rest, rejoicing in the sight,"
1277,THE HOMERIC HYMNS,"And plough the quiet sea in safe delight.""[3]"

1293,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,
1294,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,
1295,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,Greek religion seems to have contained three factors of unequal
1296,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"prominence, but ultimately of about equal importance and longevity."
1297,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"Most obvious, especially if we begin our study with Homer, is the"
1298,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"mythology which presents us with a multitude of gods, male and female,"
1299,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"often related by blood, and having social and even hostile relations"
1300,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"with one another. If we examine their characters, attributes, and"
1301,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"fables, we readily perceive that most of them are impersonations of"
1302,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"natural forces. Some, however, figure prominently as patrons of special"
1303,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"arts or special places, as Apollo of prophecy and music, of Delos and"
1304,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,Delphi; and yet others seem to be wholly personifications of human
1305,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"powers, as Athena of prudence and of martial and industrial arts."
1306,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,
1307,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"Underlying this mythology is another element, probably more ancient,"
1308,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"the worship of ancestors, local divinities, and domestic gods. With"
1309,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"these were naturally connected various ritual observances, and"
1310,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"especially the noblest and most important of rites, the sacrifice."
1311,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,Such practices may be supposed to have belonged originally to the
1312,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"tribal religion, and to have passed by analogy to the great natural"
1313,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"gods, when these had been once created by the poet and perhaps"
1314,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,identified with the older genius of that spot where their efficacy was
1315,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,first signally manifested.
1316,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,
1317,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"Finally, as a third element, we find the religion of the priests,"
1318,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"soothsayers, and magicians, as well as the rites of Orpheus, Bacchus,"
1319,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,and the Great Goddesses at Eleusis. These forms of worship showed
1320,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,Oriental affinities and partook of a kind of nocturnal horror and
1321,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,mystical enthusiasm. They were the Greek representatives of the
1322,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"religion of revelation and of sacraments, and bore much the same"
1323,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,relation to the supernaturalistic elements in Christianity as does
1324,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,the idea of a shade in Hades to the idea of a soul in heaven. The
1325,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"fundamental intuitions were the same, but in Pagan times they remained"
1326,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"vague, doubtful, and incoherent."
1327,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,
1328,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,These three forms of religion lay together in men's minds and habits
1329,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,throughout the formative period of Greek literature. There was an
1330,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"occasional rivalry among them, but the tolerance characteristic"
1331,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"of Paganism could reconcile their claims without much difficulty,"
1332,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,and admit them all to a share of honour. The history of the three
1333,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"elements, however, differs essentially, as might be expected after a"
1334,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,consideration of their respective natures. The antique family religion
1335,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"lived by inertia; it was obeyed without being justified theoretically,"
1336,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,and remained strong by its very obscurity. Many customs which a man
1337,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,may have occasion to conform to only once or twice in his life endure
1338,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,for ages and survive the ebb and flow of intellectual and political
1339,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"systems. Nursery tales, trivial superstitions, customs connected"
1340,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"with weddings or funerals, or with certain days of the year, have a"
1341,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,strange and irrational persistence; they surprise us by emerging into
1342,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,prominence after centuries of a sort of subterraneous existence. Thus
1343,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,the deification of Roman emperors was not the sacrilegious innovation
1344,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"which it might appear to be, but on the contrary a restoration of the"
1345,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"spirit of the most ancient faith, a revival called to the aid of a new"
1346,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"polity by the mingled statecraft and superstition of the times. Thus,"
1347,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"too, the Christian care in the burial of the dead (contrary as it is to"
1348,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"the theoretical spiritualism of Christianity), the feast of All Souls,"
1349,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,and the prayers for the departed are evidences of the same latent human
1350,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,religion underlying the cosmic flights and public controversies of
1351,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,theology.
1352,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,
1353,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"The mysteries, on the other hand, had essentially a spirit of"
1354,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,self-consciousness and propaganda. They came as revelations or as
1355,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,reforms; they pretended to disclose secrets handed down from remote
1356,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"antiquity, from the primeval revelation of God to man, or truths"
1357,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,recovered by the inspiration of later prophets supernaturally
1358,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"illumined. The history of these movements is, accordingly, the"
1359,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,history-of sects. They never constituted the normal and common religion
1360,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"of the people, and never impressed their spirit on the national"
1361,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,literature. Æschylus or Plato may have borrowed something from them;
1362,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,but they did so most when they assumed an attitude of open opposition
1363,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,to the exoteric religion of their country. Thus when Plato makes his
1364,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"Socrates propound a Pythagorean or Orphic doctrine of transmigration,"
1365,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"he represents the very members of the Socratic circle as surprised,"
1366,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,or as incredulous: and when they are finally silenced by the proofs
1367,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"advanced, it is only because they are overawed by the dogmatic unction"
1368,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"of a dying sage, who stimulates their imagination with poetic myths,"
1369,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,and confuses their intellect with verbal equivocations. When the mist
1370,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"of the argument has cleared away, like incense after the sacrifice,"
1371,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"there remains indeed a profound emotion, a catharsis produced by the"
1372,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"sublimity and pathos, so artfully mingled, of both scene and argument;"
1373,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"but the bare doctrine enunciated, true and profound as it is in its"
1374,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"deeper meaning, is quite incapable of appealing to an undisciplined"
1375,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"mind, and could not pass for a religious dogma except for the priestly"
1376,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,robes in which it is dressed. Thus the function of the mysteries
1377,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"of which Plato's Phædo may be regarded as a philosophic echo, was"
1378,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"to be the vehicle of revolutionary tendencies, tendencies which a"
1379,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,philosopher might privately shape in one way and a superstitious man in
1380,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,another. Both could find in the spell of an occult ceremonial and in
1381,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,the prophecies of an oracular creed an escape from the limitations of
1382,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,the official religion. Mysticism and the claim to illumination found
1383,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,in these mysteries their natural expression. The many fundamental
1384,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"questions left unanswered and unasked by Paganism, the many"
1385,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"potentialities of religious emotion left unexercised by it, were thus"
1386,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,allowed to appear.
1387,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,
1388,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,Independently of these two comparatively silent streams of religious
1389,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"life, we may trace the current of polytheistic theology,--a current"
1390,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"which naturally left a plainer trace in literature, since it contained"
1391,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,all there might be in Greece of speculation and controversy in
1392,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,religious matters. The moral sanctions of religion were embodied in the
1393,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,domestic and civic worship; the pious imagination remained thereby all
1394,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,the freer to follow the analogies of physical objects in its mythology.
1395,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,Apollo was the father of Asclepius and the leader of the Muses; his
1396,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,ideal dignity and beneficence were vouched for by those attributes.
1397,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"He could well afford, therefore, as the Sun-god, to decimate the"
1398,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,Greek army with the same fatal shafts with which he slew the Python.
1399,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"The moral function of the god was certain on other grounds, being"
1400,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,enshrined in the local religions of the people. The poet might follow
1401,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,without scruple the suggestions of experience; he might attribute to
1402,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"the god the various activities, beneficent and maleficent, observable"
1403,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,in the element over which he presided. This is a liberty taken even
1404,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"in the most moralistic religions. In the Gospels, for instance, we"
1405,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,sometimes find the kingdom of heaven illustrated by principles drawn
1406,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,from observation of this world rather than from an ideal conception of
1407,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,justice; as when we hear that to him that hath shall be given and from
1408,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. Such
1409,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,characterizations appeal to our sense of fact. They remind us that the
1410,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"God we are seeking is present and active, that he is the living God;"
1411,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,they are doubtless necessary if we are to keep religion from passing
1412,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,into a mere idealism and God into the vanishing point of our thought
1413,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"and endeavour. For we naturally seek to express his awful actuality,"
1414,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"his unchallengeable power, no less than his holiness and beauty. This"
1415,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,sense of the real existence of religious objects can only be maintained
1416,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"by identifying them with objects of actual experience, with the forces"
1417,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"of Nature, or the passions or conscience of man, or (if it must come to"
1418,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,that) with written laws or visible images.
1419,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,
1420,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,An instinctive recognition of this necessity kept Greek mythology
1421,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,ever ready to return to Nature to gather its materials afresh from a
1422,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"docile, if poetical, observation of reality. The character of the god"
1423,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,must be studied in the manifestations of his chosen element; otherwise
1424,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"men might forget that, although the form of the god was poetical, his"
1425,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,essence was a positive reality of the most practical kind. Zeus must
1426,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"still toss his ambrosial locks with a certain irritation, in order"
1427,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,that we may recognize him in the rumblings of the sky; he must still
1428,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"be capable of wrath and deliberate malice, that his awful hand may be"
1429,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,thought to have hurled the thunderbolt. Cronos must not be forbidden
1430,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"to devour his children, else we should no longer reverence in him the"
1431,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,inexorable might of time. Mythology was quite right in not shrinking
1432,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"from such poetic audacities. They were its chief title to legitimacy,"
1433,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"the proof, amid the embroideries of fancy which over-lay the divine"
1434,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"idea, that the god was not an invention, but a fact. He had been found,"
1435,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"he was known. His character, like all character, was merely a principle"
1436,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"which reflection discovered in his observed conduct. The reality, then,"
1437,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,of the mythological gods was initially unquestionable; and the more
1438,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"faithful the study of Nature by which the poet was inspired, the more"
1439,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,authority did his prophetic vision retain.
1440,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,
1441,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,But the intense imaginative vitality that must have preceded Homer and
1442,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"Hesiod, the prodigious gift of sympathetic observation to which we owe"
1443,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"Zeus and Pan and all their endless retinue, was too glorious to last."
1444,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,No later interpreter could find so much meaning in his text. Mythology
1445,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"was accordingly placed in a sad dilemma, with either horn fatal to"
1446,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"its life; it must either be impoverished to remain sincere, or become"
1447,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"artificial to remain adequate. The history of Greek religion, on its"
1448,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"speculative side, is nothing but the story of this double decadence."
1449,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,Reflection upon the process of Nature and desire for philosophic truth
1450,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,led inevitably to a blank pantheism and to the reduction of positive
1451,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,traditions to moral allegories. This was the direction taken by the
1452,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"Stoic theology. On the other hand, adherence to the traditional gods,"
1453,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,with no further vivifying reference to their natural functions in
1454,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"the world, could lead only to arbitrary fictions, which, having no"
1455,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"foothold or justification in reality, were incapable of withstanding"
1456,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,the first sceptical attack. What an age of imagination had intuited as
1457,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"truth, an age of reflection could preserve only as fable; and as fable,"
1458,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"accordingly, the religion of the ancients survived throughout the"
1459,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,Christian ages. It remains still the mother-tongue of the imagination
1460,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"and, in spite of all revolutions and admixtures, is the classic"
1461,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"language of art and poetry, which no other means of expression has"
1462,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,superseded.
1463,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,
1464,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"Beginning, however, with that zealous Protestant, the old Xenophanes,"
1465,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"the austerer minds, moralists, naturalists, and wits, united in"
1466,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,decrying the fanciful polytheism of the poets. This criticism was
1467,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,in one sense unjust; it did not consider the original justification
1468,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"of mythology in human nature and in the external facts. It was,"
1469,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"like all heresy or partial scepticism, in a sense superficial and"
1470,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,unphilosophical. It was far from conceiving that its own tenets and
1471,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"assumptions were as groundless, without being as natural or adequate,"
1472,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,as the system it attacked. To a person sufficiently removed by time or
1473,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"by philosophy from the controversies of sects, orthodoxy must always"
1474,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,appear right and heresy wrong; for he sees in orthodoxy the product of
1475,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"the creative mind, of faith and constructive logic, but in heresy only"
1476,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,the rebellion of some partial interest or partial insight against the
1477,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,corollaries of a formative principle imperfectly grasped and obeyed
1478,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"with hesitation. At a distance, the criticism that disintegrates any"
1479,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,great product of art or mind must always appear short-sighted and
1480,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"unamiable. Socrates, invoking; the local deities of brooks and meadows,"
1481,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"or paying the debt of a cock to Asclepius (in thanksgiving, it is said,"
1482,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"for a happy death), is more reasonable and noble to our mind than are"
1483,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,the hard denials of Xenophanes or Theodoras. But in their day the
1484,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,revolt of the sceptics had its relative justification. The imagination
1485,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"had dried up, and what had once been a natural interpretation of"
1486,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,facts now seemed an artificial addition to them. An elaborate and
1487,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,irrelevant world of fiction seemed to have been imposed on human
1488,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"credulity. Mythology was, in fact, already largely irrelevant; the"
1489,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"experience poetized by it had been forgotten and the symbol, in its"
1490,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"insignificance, could not be honestly or usefully retained."
1491,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,
1492,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"The Greek philosophers, as a rule, proceeded cautiously in these"
1493,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,matters. They passed mythology by with a conventional reverence and
1494,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,looked elsewhere for the true object of their personal religion. But
1495,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,the old mythological impulse was not yet spent; it showed itself
1496,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,still active in all the early philosophers who gave the godhead new
1497,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,incarnations congruous with the character of their respective physical
1498,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,systems. To the Socratic School the natural world was no longer the
1499,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,sphere in which divinity was to be found. They looked for the divine
1500,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,rather in moral and intelligible ideas. But not only did they carry the
1501,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"mythological instinct with them into that new field, they also retained"
1502,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"it in the field of Nature, whenever they still regarded Nature as real."
1503,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"Thus Aristotle, while he rejected the anthropomorphism of the popular"
1504,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"faith, attributing it to political exigencies, turned the forty-nine"
1505,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"spheres, of which he conjectured that the heaven might be composed,"
1506,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"into a pantheon of forty-nine divinities. Every primary movement,"
1507,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"he argued, must be the expression of an eternal essence by which"
1508,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"the movement is justified, as the movement of the mind in thinking"
1509,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,or loving is justified by the truth or excellence of the object of
1510,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"thought or of love. Without such a worthy object, these spiritual"
1511,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,activities would be irrational; and no less irrational would be the
1512,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"motion of the spheres, were each not obedient to the influence of some"
1513,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,sacred and immutable principle. Forty-nine gods accordingly exist;
1514,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"but no more. For, since the essence of each is to be the governing"
1515,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"ideal of a motion, the number of motions in the sky determines the"
1516,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"number of divine first principles. The gods, we see, are still the"
1517,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,souls of Nature; a soul without a body would be a principle without an
1518,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"application; there can be no gods, then, without a phenomenal function,"
1519,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,no gods that do not appear in the operations of Nature. This astronomic
1520,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"mythology was surely not less poetical than that of Homer, even if, by"
1521,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"virtue of a certain cold and abstract purity, not unworthy of the stars"
1522,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"of which it spoke, it was more difficult and sublime. We may observe in"
1523,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,it a last application of the ancient mythological method by which the
1524,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,phenomena of Nature became evidence of the existence and character of
1525,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,the gods.
1526,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,
1527,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"But the celestial deities of Aristotle, and the minor creative gods of"
1528,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"Plato that correspond to them, retained too much poetic individuality"
1529,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,for the still poorer imagination of later times. The most religious
1530,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,of sects during the classical decadence was that of the Stoics; in
1531,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"them the spirit of conformity, which is a chief part even of the"
1532,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"religions of hope, constituted by its exclusive cultivation a religion"
1533,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"of despair. The name of Zeus, and an equally equivocal use of the word"
1534,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"""reason"" to designate the regularity of Nature, served to disguise the"
1535,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,alien brutality of the power or law to which all the gods had been
1536,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"reduced. Against the background of a materialistic pantheism, in which"
1537,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"Stoic speculation culminated, two positive interests stood out: one,"
1538,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,the resolute and truly human courage with which the Stoic faced the
1539,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"reality as he conceived it, and kept his dignity and his conscience"
1540,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"pure although heaven might fall; the other, the efforts he made, in his"
1541,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"need for religion, to rejuvenate and reinterpret the pagan forms. The"
1542,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"fables he turned into ethical allegories, the oracles, auspices, and"
1543,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"other superstitious rites, he transformed into quasi-scientific ways of"
1544,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,reading the book of Nature and forecasting events.
1545,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,
1546,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"This possibility of prophecy constituted the Stoic ""providence"" which"
1547,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,the sentimentality of modern apologists has been glad to confuse
1548,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"with the _benevolent_ Providence of Christian dogma, a Providence"
1549,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,making for the salvation of men. The Stoic providence excluded that
1550,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,essential element of benevolence; it was merely the fact that Nature
1551,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"was prophetic of her own future, that her parts, both in space and in"
1552,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"time, were magically composed into one living system. Mythology thus"
1553,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,ended with the conception of a single god whose body was the whole
1554,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"physical universe, whose fable was all history, and whose character"
1555,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,was the principle of the universal natural order. No attempt was made
1556,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,by the ancient Stoics to make this divinity better or more amiable
1557,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"than the evidence of experience showed it to be; the self-centred,"
1558,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"self-sufficient Stoic morality, the recourse to suicide, and the"
1559,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"equality in happiness and dignity between the wise man and Zeus, all"
1560,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,prove quite conclusively that nothing more was asked or expected of
1561,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"Nature than what she chose to give; to be virtuous was in man's power,"
1562,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,and nothing else was a good to man. The universe could neither benefit
1563,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"nor injure him; and thus we see that, despite a reverential tone and"
1564,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"an occasional reminiscence of the thunderbolts of Zeus, the Stoic's"
1565,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,conscience knew how to scorn the moral nothingness of that blank deity
1566,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,to which his metaphysics had reduced the genial company of the gods.
1567,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,
1568,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,Thus the reality which the naturalistic gods had borrowed from the
1569,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"elements proved to be a dangerous prerogative; being real and manifest,"
1570,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,these gods had to be conceived according to our experience of their
1571,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"operation, so that with every advance in scientific observation"
1572,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"theology had to be revised, and something had to be subtracted from"
1573,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,the personality and benevolence of the gods. The moral character
1574,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,originally attributed to them necessarily receded before the clearer
1575,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,definition of natural forces and the accumulated experience of
1576,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"national disasters. Finally, little remained of the gods except their"
1577,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"names, reduced to rhetorical synonyms for the various departments of"
1578,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,Nature; Phoebus was nothing but a bombastic way of saying the sun;
1579,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"Hephæstus became nothing but fire, Eros or Aphrodite nothing but love,"
1580,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,Zeus nothing but the general force and law of Nature. Thus the gods
1581,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"remained real, but were no longer gods. If belief in their reality"
1582,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"was to be kept up, they could not retain too many attributes that"
1583,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"had no empirical manifestation. They must be reduced, as it were, to"
1584,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,their fighting weight. All that the imagination had added to them by
1585,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"way of personal character, sanctity, and life must be rejected as"
1586,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,anthropomorphism and fable.
1587,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,
1588,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,Such is the necessary logic of natural religion. If Nature manifests
1589,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"the existence of a god, she must to that extent manifest his character;"
1590,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"if she does not manifest his character, she cannot involve his"
1591,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,existence. We observe to-day a process exactly analogous to that by
1592,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,which the natural divinities of Greece were reduced again to the
1593,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,physical or social forces from which poetry had originally evoked
1594,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,their forms. Many minds are grown too timid to build their religious
1595,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"faith unblushingly on revelation, or on that moral imagination or"
1596,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,inward demand which revelation comes to express and to satisfy. They
1597,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"seek, therefore, to naturalize the Deity and to identify it with some"
1598,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"principle of history, of Nature, or of logic. But this identification"
1599,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,cannot be made without great concessions on both sides. The
1600,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"accommodations which ensue inevitably involve many equivocations, and"
1601,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"some misrepresentations of the heterogeneous principles, now natural,"
1602,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"now moral, which it is sought to unify. Confused and agonized by"
1603,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"these contradictions, the natural theologian, if he keep his honesty,"
1604,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,can only rest in the end in a chastened recognition of the facts of
1605,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"experience, toward which he will, no doubt, exercise his acquired"
1606,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"habits of acquiescence and euphemism. But these habits, the survival"
1607,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"of which gives his philosophy some air of being still a religion, will"
1608,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,not be inherited by his disciples and successors; a pious manner may
1609,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"survive religious faith, but will not survive it long. The society"
1610,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,to whom the reformer teaches a reticent and embarrassed naturalism
1611,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,will discard the reticence and avow the naturalism with pride. The
1612,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,masses of men will see no reason why they should not live out their
1613,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,native impulses or acquired passions without fear of that environing
1614,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"power of which they are, after all, the highest embodiment; while a"
1615,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"few thinkers, devout and rational by temperament, will know how to"
1616,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,maintain their dignity of spirit in the face of a universe of which
1617,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,they ask no favour save the revelation of its laws. Thus irreligion for
1618,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,the many and Stoicism for the few is the end of natural religion in the
1619,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,modern world as it was in the ancient.
1620,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,
1621,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"But natural religion (that is, the turning of the facts and laws of"
1622,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,Nature or of experience into an object of worship) is by no means a
1623,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,primitive nor an ultimate form of religion; it is rather of all the
1624,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,forms of religion the most unnatural and the least capable of existing
1625,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"without a historical and emotional setting, independent of its own"
1626,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,essence and inconsistent with its principle. No nation has ever had
1627,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,a merely natural religion. What is called by that name has been the
1628,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"appanage of a few philosophers in ages of religious disintegration,"
1629,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"when the habit of worship, surviving the belief in any proper object"
1630,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"of worship, has been transferred with effort and uncertainty to the"
1631,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"natural order which alone remained before the mind,--to the cosmos,"
1632,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"the self, the state, or humanity. Mythology, of which natural religion"
1633,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"is the last and most abstract phase, was originally religious only in"
1634,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"so far as it was supernatural in so far, I mean, as the analogies of"
1635,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"outer Nature led the poet to conceive some moral ideal, some glorious"
1636,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"being full of youth and serenity, of passion and wisdom. Only when"
1637,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,thus transfigured into the human could the natural seem divine. The
1638,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"Greeks were never idolaters, and no more worshipped the sun or moon"
1639,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,or the whole of Nature than they did statues of bronze or marble; they
1640,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,worshipped only the god who had a temporal image in the temple as he
1641,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,had an eternal image in the sun or in the universe.
1642,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,
1643,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"It happened, therefore, that in the decay of mythology the gods could"
1644,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,still survive as moral ideals. The more they were cut off from their
1645,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"accidental foothold in the world of fact, the more clearly could they"
1646,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,manifest their essence as expressions of the world of values. We have
1647,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,mentioned the fact that the greater gods of Greece were almost wholly
1648,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,detached from the cosmographical hints which had originally suggested
1649,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"their character and fable. Thus emancipated, these nobler gods could"
1650,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"survive in the consciousness of the devout, fixed there by their"
1651,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,purely moral significance and poetic truth. Apollo or Athena showed
1652,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"little or nothing of a naturalistic origin; they were patrons of life,"
1653,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"embodiments of the ideal, objects of contemplation for souls that by"
1654,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,prayer would rise to the semblance of the god to whom they prayed. This
1655,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,transformation into the moral had been going on from the beginning in
1656,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,the religious mind of Greece. It was really the legitimate fulfilment
1657,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,of that translation into the human to which mythology itself was due.
1658,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,But mythology had merely turned the physical into the personal and
1659,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,impassioned; religion was now to turn the psychical into the good.
1660,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,This tendency came to a vivid and rational expression in Plato. The
1661,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"gods, he declared, should be represented only as they were, _i.e._ as"
1662,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,moral ideals. The scandal of their fables should be removed and they
1663,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"should be regarded as authors only of the good, in their own lives as"
1664,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,in ours. To refer all things to the efficacy of the gods should be
1665,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"accounted impiety. They, like the supreme and abstract principle of all"
1666,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"excellence which they embodied, could be the authors only of what is"
1667,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,good.
1668,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,
1669,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,Had this remarkable doctrine been carried out fully it would have led
1670,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,to important results. We should have had goodness as the criterion of
1671,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"divinity, to the exclusion of power. God would have become avowedly an"
1672,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"ideal, a pattern to which the world might or might not conform. Such"
1673,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"potential conformity would have remained dependent on causes, natural"
1674,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"or free, with which God, not being a power, could have nothing to do."
1675,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"Plato and Aristotle did, in fact, construct a theology on these lines,"
1676,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,but they obscured its purity in their well-meant attempts to connect
1677,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,(more or less mythically or magically) their own Socratic principle
1678,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,of excellence with the cosmic principles of the earlier philosophers.
1679,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,The elements of confusion and pantheism which were thus introduced
1680,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"into the Socratic philosophy made it more acceptable, perhaps, to the"
1681,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"theologians of later times, in whose religion a pantheistic tendency"
1682,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"was also latent. In the hands of Jewish, Christian, or Mohammedan"
1683,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,commentators the mythical and magical part of the Greek conceptions
1684,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,was naturally emphasized and the rational part reinterpreted and
1685,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"obscured. Plato had spoken, in one of his myths, of a Demiurgos, a"
1686,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"personification of the Idea of the Good, who directly or indirectly"
1687,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"made the world in his own image, rendering it as perfect as the"
1688,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,indeterminate Chaos he worked on would allow. Aristotle had spoken of
1689,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"an intelligence, happy and self-contemplative, who was the principle of"
1690,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"movement in the heavens, and through the heavens in the rest of Nature."
1691,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,Such expressions had a sound far too congruous with Mosaic doctrine not
1692,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"to be seized upon with joy by the apologists of the new faiths, who"
1693,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,were glad to invoke the authority of classic poets and philosophers in
1694,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,favour of doctrines that in their Hebrew expression might so easily
1695,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,seem crude and irrational to the Gentiles. This assimilation gave to
1696,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,the casual myths of Plato and to the meagre though bold argumentation
1697,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,of Aristotle a turn and a significance which they hardly had to their
1698,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,authors. If we approach these philosophers as we should from the point
1699,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"of view of Greek literature and life, and prepare ourselves to see"
1700,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,in them the disciples of Socrates rather than (what Plato was once
1701,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"actually declared to be) the disciples of Moses, we shall see that"
1702,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"they were simply, mythologists of the Ideal; they refined the gods of"
1703,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"tradition into patrons of civic discipline and art, the gods of natural"
1704,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,philosophy into principles of intelligibility and beauty.
1705,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,
1706,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,The creation described in the Timæus is a transparent parable. Elements
1707,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,which ethical reflection distinguishes in the field of experience
1708,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"are turned in that dialogue, with undisguised freedom of fancy, into"
1709,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"so many half-personified primitive powers; the Ideas, the Demiurgos,"
1710,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"Chaos, the Indeterminate, and the ""gods of gods."" Plato has not"
1711,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,forgotten the lessons of Socrates and Parmenides. He distrusts as much
1712,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,as they any natural or genetic philosophy of existence. He virtually
1713,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"tells us that, if we must have a history of creation, we can hardly"
1714,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"do better than to take ideal or moral principles, combine them as we"
1715,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"might so many material elements, and see how the intelligible part"
1716,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,of existence may thus receive a quasi-explanation. God remains the
1717,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"creator of the good only, because what he is mythically said to create"
1718,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,is merely that in Nature which spontaneously resembles him or conforms
1719,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"to his idea; only this element in Nature is intelligible or good, and"
1720,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"therefore the principle of goodness may be said to be its cause. Thus,"
1721,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"for example, if we chose to write an Anatomy of Melancholy, we might"
1722,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,attribute to the Demon of Spleen or to the Blue Devils only the sombre
1723,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"elements of that soulful compound, which, however, the evil imps would"
1724,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,eternally tend to make as absolutely dyspeptic and like unto themselves
1725,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"as its primordial texture would allow. In exactly such a way Plato,"
1726,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"in his allegorical manner, constructed a universe with a poetical"
1727,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"machinery of moral forces, personified and treated as agents. When"
1728,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"the thin veil of allegory is drawn aside, there remains nothing but a"
1729,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,splendid illustration of the Socratic philosophy; we are taught that
1730,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"the only science is moral science, and that, if we wish to understand"
1731,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"the world, we must bend our minds to the definition of its qualities"
1732,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"and values, which are all that is intelligible in it. Essences and"
1733,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,values alone are knowable and fixed and amenable to science. If we
1734,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"insist on history and cosmogony, we must be satisfied with having them"
1735,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"presented to us in allegorical form, and made to follow ethics as the"
1736,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,Timæus follows the Republic. Natural philosophy can be nothing but a
1737,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,sort of analytic retrospect by which we trace the first glimmerings
1738,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,and the progressive manifestation in Nature of those ideas which have
1739,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,authority over our own minds.
1740,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,
1741,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"Phenomena had for Plato existence without reality, that is, without"
1742,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,intelligibility or value. They were a mere appearance. We need not be
1743,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"surprised, then, that he refused altogether to construct a theology"
1744,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,by the poetic interpretation of phenomena and preferred to construct
1745,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"one allegorically out of his moral conceptions, the good and the"
1746,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"ideal. Aristotle, too, while adhering incidentally, as we have seen,"
1747,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"to a purified astronomical theology, capped this with a purified moral"
1748,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"theology of his own. The Platonic picture-gallery of ideas, with"
1749,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"the abstract principle of excellence that unified them, gave place"
1750,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,in his philosophy to an Ideal realized in the concrete and existing
1751,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,as an individual. We may venture to say that among the thinkers of
1752,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,all nations Aristotle was the first to reach the conception of what
1753,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"may fitly be called God. Neither the national deity of the Hebrews,"
1754,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"as then conceived, nor the natural deities of the Gentiles, nor"
1755,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"the half-physical, half-logical abstractions of the earlier Greek"
1756,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"philosophers really corresponded to the notion of a being spiritual,"
1757,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"personal, and perfect, immutable without being abstract, and omnipotent"
1758,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,without effort and without degradation. Aristotle first constructed
1759,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"this ideal, not out of his fancy, but by building on the solid ground"
1760,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,of human nature and following to their point of union the lines
1761,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"which moral aspiration and effort actually follow. Nay, the ideal he"
1762,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,pointed to was to be the goal not of human life only but of natural
1763,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,life in all its forms. The analytic study of Nature (a study which at
1764,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,the same time must be imaginative and sympathetic) could guide us to
1765,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,the conception of her inner needs and tendencies and of what their
1766,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,proper fulfilment would be. We could then see that this fulfilment
1767,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,would lie in intelligence and thought. Growth is for the sake of the
1768,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"fruition of life, and the fruition of life consists in the pursuit and"
1769,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"attainment of objects. The moral virtues belong to the pursuit, the"
1770,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"intellectual to the attainment. Knowledge is the end of all endeavour,"
1771,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,the justification and fulfilment of all growth. Intelligence is the
1772,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,clarification of love.
1773,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,
1774,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"A being, then, whose life should be a life of pure and complete"
1775,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"knowledge, would embody the goal toward which all Nature strives."
1776,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,When we ponder duly the short phrases in which Aristotle propounds
1777,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,his conception of God we find that he has called up before us the
1778,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"noblest possible object of human thought, the presentiment of that"
1779,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,thought's perfect fulfilment. There is no alloy of naturalism in this
1780,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"conception, and at the same time no suspicion of irrelevancy. This"
1781,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"God is not a mere title of honour for the psycho-physical universe,"
1782,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"confusedly conceived and lumped together; he is an ultra-mundane ideal,"
1783,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,to be an inviolate standard and goal for all moving reality. Yet he
1784,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"is not irrelevant to the facts and forces of the world, not the dream"
1785,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,of an abstracted poet. He is an idea which reality everywhere evokes
1786,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,in evoking its own deepest craving and need. Nothing is so pertinent
1787,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,and momentous in life as the object we are trying to attain by thought
1788,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"or action, since that object is the source of our inspiration and"
1789,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"the standard of our success. Thus Aristotle's God is not superfluous,"
1790,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"not invented. This theology is a true idealism, I mean an idealism"
1791,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"itself purely ideal, which establishes the authority of human demands,"
1792,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"ethical, and logical, without impugning the existence or efficacy of"
1793,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,that material universe which it endows with a meaning and a standard.
1794,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,
1795,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"Yet this rational conception, the natural out-growth of the Socratic"
1796,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"philosophy, establishes a dualism between the actual and the ideal"
1797,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,against which the human mind easily rebels. Aristotle himself was
1798,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"hardly faithful to it. He tried to prove the existence of his God, and"
1799,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,existence is something quite irrelevant to an ideal. This confusion is
1800,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"very excusable, especially in an age when the strictly mechanical view"
1801,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,of Nature still seemed hopelessly inadequate. Aristotle consequently
1802,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,tried to understand the natural world by viewing it systematically
1803,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"from the point of view of moral science, as Plato had done less"
1804,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,coherently in his myths; and hence came what we must regard as the
1805,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"great error of Aristotle's philosophy, the belief in the efficacy"
1806,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"of final causes and in the preëxistence of entelechies. But, apart"
1807,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"from this unhappy question of existence, which is, as we have said,"
1808,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"irrelevant to an ideal, Aristotle's conception of God remains, perhaps,"
1809,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,the most philosophical that has yet been constructed. Without any
1810,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"concessions to sentiment or superstition, it presents us with a sublime"
1811,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"vision of the essentially human, of a nature as free from an unworthy"
1812,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,anthropomorphism as from an inhuman abstractness. It is made both human
1813,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,and superhuman by the same principle of idealization. It is the final
1814,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"cause of Nature and man, the realization of their imminent upward"
1815,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"effort, the essence that would contain all their values and escape all"
1816,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,their imperfections.
1817,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,
1818,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"We may well doubt, however, whether men in general will ever be ready"
1819,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,to accept so austere a theology in guise of a religion; they were
1820,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,certainly not ready to do so at the end of the classical period. The
1821,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"inheritance of Paganism fell instead to Christianity, in which ethical"
1822,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"and naturalistic elements were again united, although united in a new"
1823,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"way. For, while the scheme of Paganism, and of all the philosophies"
1824,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"that sought to rationalize Paganism, was cosmic and static, the scheme"
1825,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,of Christianity was historical. They spoke of the dynamic relations of
1826,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"heaven and earth, or of the immutable hierarchy of ideas and essences;"
1827,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,even Aristotle's God was somehow in spatial relations to the Universe
1828,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"which he set in motion. The religion of the Hebrews, on the other"
1829,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"hand, had been essentially historical and civic: it had been concerned"
1830,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,with the moral destinies of Israel and the dealings of Jehovah with
1831,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,his people. Christianity inherited this historical character; its
1832,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,mysteries occurred in time. Not only the redemption of the world but
1833,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"the vocation and sanctification of the individual were progressive,"
1834,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,and when the habits and problems of Christian theology were carried
1835,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"over by the German idealists into the region of pure metaphysics, the"
1836,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,systems they conceived were still systems of evolution. God was to be
1837,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,manifest in the development of things. For Christianity in its own way
1838,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,had spoken from the beginning of a gradual and yet to be completed
1839,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"descent of the divine into the natural by the agency of prophecy, law,"
1840,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,and sacramental institutions; it had represented the relations of God
1841,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"to man in a vast historic drama, of which creation constituted the"
1842,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"opening, the fall and redemption the nexus, and the last judgment the"
1843,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,unravelling.
1844,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,
1845,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,Thus appeared a new scheme for the unification of the natural and the
1846,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,moral. The harmony which the old religion had failed to establish
1847,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"in space and in Nature, the new sought to establish in history and"
1848,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"in time. It was hoped that life and experience, sin and redemption,"
1849,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"might manifest that divinity which had fled out of the sea and sky,"
1850,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,and which it seemed sacrilege to identify any longer with the animal
1851,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,vitality of the universe. Whether the same criticism that disintegrated
1852,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,mythology and isolated its elements of science and of poetry would
1853,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,not be fatal to the new combination of the moral and the factual in
1854,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"the history of man, is hardly a question for us here. Suffice it to"
1855,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,point out the problem and to register the solution which was found
1856,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,in the ancient world to the analogous problem that presented itself
1857,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,there. The first impulse of the imagination is always to combine
1858,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"in the object all the elements which lie together in the mind, to"
1859,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"project them indiscriminately into a single conception of reality,"
1860,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,enriched with as many qualities as there are phases and values in our
1861,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,experience. But these phases and values have diverse origins and do not
1862,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,permanently hang together. It becomes after a while impossible to keep
1863,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,them attached to a single image; they have to be distributed according
1864,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"to their true order and connections, some objectified into a physical"
1865,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"universe of mechanism and law, others built into a system of rational"
1866,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"objects, into a hierarchy of logical and moral ideas. So the lovely"
1867,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,pantheon of the Greeks yielded in time to analysis and was dissolved
1868,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"into abstract science and conscious fable. So, too, the body and soul"
1869,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,"of later religions may come to be divided, when they render back to"
1870,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,earth what they contain of positive history and to the heaven of man's
1871,THE DISSOLUTION OF PAGANISM,indomitable idealism what they contain of aspiration and hope.

1880,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
1881,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
1882,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"The deathbed of Paganism was surrounded by doctors. Some, the Stoics,"
1883,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,advised a conversion into pantheism (with an allegorical interpretation
1884,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"of mythology to serve the purposes of edification); others, the"
1885,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Neo-Platonists, prescribed instead a supernatural philosophy, where the"
1886,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,efficacy of all traditional rites would be justified by incorporation
1887,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"into a system of universal magic, and the gods would find their"
1888,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,place among the legions of spirits and demons that were to people
1889,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,the concentric spheres. But these doctors had no knowledge of the
1890,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"patient's natural constitution; their medicines, prescribed with the"
1891,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"best intentions, were in truth poisons and only hastened the inevitable"
1892,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,end. Nor had the unfortunate doctors the consolation of being heirs.
1893,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Parasites that they were, they perished with the patron on whose"
1894,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"substance they had fed, and Christianity, their despised rival, came"
1895,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,into sole possession.
1896,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
1897,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Yet Neo-Platonism, for all we can see, responded as well as"
1898,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Christianity to the needs of the time, and had besides great external"
1899,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"advantages in its alliance with tradition, with civil power, and with"
1900,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,philosophy. If the demands of the age were for a revealed religion and
1901,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"an ascetic morality, Neo-Platonism could satisfy them to the full."
1902,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Why, then, should the Hellenic world have broken with the creations"
1903,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"of its own genius, so plastic, eloquent, and full of resource, to"
1904,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,run after foreign gods and new doctrines that must naturally have
1905,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"been stumbling-blocks to its prejudices, and foolishness to its"
1906,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,intelligence? Shall we say that the triumph of Christianity was a
1907,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,miracle? Is it not a doubtful encomium on a religion to say that only
1908,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,by miracle could it come to be believed? Perhaps the forces of human
1909,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,reason and emotion suffice to explain this faith. We prefer to think
1910,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"so; otherwise, however complete and final the triumph of Christianity"
1911,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"might be, it would not be justified or beneficent."
1912,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
1913,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,Neo-Platonism arose in the midst of the same conditions as
1914,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Christianity. There was weariness and disgust with the life of nature,"
1915,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"decay of political virtue, desire for some personal and supernatural"
1916,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,good. It was hardly necessary to preach the doctrine of original
1917,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,sin to that society; the visible blight that had fallen on classic
1918,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,civilization was proof enough of that. What it was necessary to preach
1919,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,was redemption. It was necessary to point to some sphere of refuge and
1920,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"of healthful resort, where the ignominies and the frivolities of this"
1921,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"world might be forgotten, and where the hunger of a heart left empty"
1922,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,by its corroding passions might be finally satisfied. But where find
1923,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,such a supernatural world? By what revelation learn its nature and be
1924,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,assured of its existence?
1925,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
1926,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Neo-Platonism opened vistas into the supernatural, but the avenues of"
1927,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,approach which it had chosen and the principle which had given form
1928,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,to its system foredoomed it to failure as a religion. This avenue was
1929,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"dialectic, and this principle the hypostasis of abstractions. Plato"
1930,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"had pointed out this path in his genial allegories. He had, by a"
1931,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"poetical figure, turned the ideas of reason into the component forces"
1932,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"of creation. This was, with him, a method of expression, but being"
1933,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"the only method he was inclined to employ, it naturally entangled"
1934,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"and occasionally, perhaps, deceived his intelligence; for a poet"
1935,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,easily mistakes his inspired tropes for the physiology of Nature. Yet
1936,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Platonic dogma, even when meant as such, retained the transparency"
1937,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,and significance of a myth; philosophy was still a language for the
1938,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"expression of experience, and dialectic a method and not a creed. But"
1939,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"the master's counters, current during six centuries of intellectual"
1940,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"decadence, had become his disciples' money. Each of his abstractions"
1941,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"seemed to them a discovery, each of his metaphors a revelation. The"
1942,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"myths of the great dialogues, and, above all, the fanciful machinery"
1943,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"of the Timæus, interpreted with an incredible literalness and naive"
1944,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"earnestness, such as only Biblical exegesis can rival, formed the"
1945,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,starting point of the new revelation. The method and insight thus
1946,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,obtained were then employed in filling the _lacunæ_ of the system and
1947,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"spreading its wings wider and wider, until a prodigious hierarchy of"
1948,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"supernatural existences had been invented, from which the natural world"
1949,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,was made to depend as a last link and lowest emanation.
1950,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
1951,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"The baselessness and elaboration of this theology were, of course, far"
1952,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"from being obstacles to its success in such an age. On the contrary,"
1953,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,the less evidence could be found in common experience for what a man
1954,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"appeared to know, the more deeply, people inferred, must he be versed"
1955,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"in supernatural lore, and the greater, accordingly, was his authority."
1956,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,Nor was the spell of personal genius and even holiness wanting in the
1957,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,leaders of the new philosophy to lend it colour and persuasiveness with
1958,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"the many, to whom metaphysical conceptions are less impressive than"
1959,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"is an eloquent personality, or a reputation for miraculous powers."
1960,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Plotinus, to speak only of the greatest of the sect, had, in fact, a"
1961,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"notable success in his day. His lectures at Rome, we are told, were"
1962,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,attended by all the fashion and intellect of the capital; and his large
1963,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"and systematic thought, his subtlety and precision, his comparatively"
1964,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"sober eloquence, and his assurance, if we may say so, in treading the"
1965,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"clouds, have made him at all times a great authority with those persons"
1966,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,who look in philosophy rather for impressive results than for solid
1967,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,foundations. His contemporaries were eminently persons of that type. A
1968,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"hungry man, when you bring him bread, does not stop to make scrupulous"
1969,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,inquiries about the mill or the oven from which you bring it.
1970,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
1971,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,But the trouble was that the bread of Plotinus was a stone. The heart
1972,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"cannot feed on thin and elaborate abstractions, irrelevant to its"
1973,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,needs and divorced from the natural objects of its interest. Men will
1974,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,often accept the baldest fictions as truths; but it is impossible
1975,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"for them to give a human meaning to vacuous conceptions, or to grow"
1976,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"to love the categories of logic, interweaving their image with the"
1977,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,actions and emotions of daily life. Religion must spring from the
1978,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,people; it must draw its form from tradition and its substance from
1979,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,the national imagination and conscience. Neo-Platonism drew both
1980,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,form and substance from a system of abstract thought. Its gods were
1981,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"still-born, being generated by logical dichotomy. Only in the lower"
1982,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"purlieus of the system, filled in by accepting current superstitions,"
1983,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,was there any contact with something like vital religious forces. But
1984,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"those minor elements--hopes and fears about another world, fasts and"
1985,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"penances, ecstasies and marvels--had no necessary relation to that"
1986,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"metaphysical system. Such practices could be found in every religion,"
1987,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,in every philosophical sect of the time. The Alexandrian dialectic of
1988,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"the supernatural accordingly remained a mere schema or skeleton, to be"
1989,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"filled in with the materials of some real religion, if such a religion"
1990,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,should arise. As such a schema the Neo-Platonic system actually passed
1991,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"over to Christian theology, furnishing the latter with its categories,"
1992,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"its language, and its speculative method. But that dialectic served in"
1993,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,Christianity to give form to a religious substance furnished by Hebrew
1994,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"and apostolic tradition, a religious substance such as, after the Pagan"
1995,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"religion was discredited, Neo-Platonism necessarily lacked and was"
1996,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,powerless to generate.
1997,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
1998,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,We have mentioned apostolic tradition. It is fortunately not requisite
1999,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"for our purpose to discuss the origin of this tradition, much less to"
2000,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,decide how much of what the Christian Church eventually taught might
2001,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,be traced to its Founder. That is a point which even the most thorough
2002,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"scholars seem still to decide mainly by their prejudices, perhaps"
2003,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,because other material is lacking on which to base a decision. For our
2004,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,present object we may admit the most extreme hypotheses as equally
2005,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,possible. The whole body of Catholic doctrine may have been contained
2006,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"in the oral teaching of Christ; or, on the other hand, a historical"
2007,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Jesus may not have existed at all, or may have been one among many"
2008,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"obscure Jewish revolutionists, the one who, by accident, came afterward"
2009,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,to be regarded as the initiator of a movement to which all sorts of
2010,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"forces contributed, and with which he had really had nothing to do. In"
2011,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,either case the fact remains which alone interests us here; that after
2012,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"three or four centuries of confused struggles, an institution emerged"
2013,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"which called itself the Catholic Church. This church, possessed of"
2014,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"a recognized hierarchy and a recognized dogma, triumphed, both over"
2015,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"the ancient religion, which it called Paganism, and over its many"
2016,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"collateral rivals, which it called heresies. Why did it triumph? What"
2017,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,was there in its novel dogma and practice that enchained the minds that
2018,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Paganism could retain no longer, and that would not be content with"
2019,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Neo-Platonism, native, philosophical, and pliable as that system was?"
2020,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2021,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"The answer, to be adequate, would have to be long; but perhaps we"
2022,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,may indicate the spirit in which it ought to be conceived. Paganism
2023,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"was a religion, but was discarded because it was not supernatural:"
2024,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,Neo-Platonism could not be maintained because it was not a religion.
2025,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Christianity was both. It had its roots in a national faith, moulded"
2026,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,by the trials and passions of a singularly religious people; that
2027,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"connection with Judaism gave Christianity a foothold in history, a"
2028,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"definite dogmatic nucleus, which it was a true instinct in the Church"
2029,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"never to abandon, much as certain speculative heresies might cry out"
2030,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,against the unnatural union of a theory of redemption with one of
2031,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"creation, and of a world-denying ascetic idealism, which Christianity"
2032,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"was essentially, with the national laws, the crude deism, and the"
2033,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"strenuous worldliness of the ancient Jews. However, had the Gnostic"
2034,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"or Manichæan heresies been victorious, Christianity would have been"
2035,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"reduced to a floating speculation: its hard kernel of positive dogma,"
2036,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"of Scripture, and of hieratic tradition would have been dissolved. It"
2037,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,would have ceased to represent antiquity or to hand down an ancestral
2038,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"piety: in fine, by its eagerness to express itself as a perfect"
2039,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"philosophy, it would have ceased to be a religion. How essential an"
2040,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"element its Hebraism was, we can see now by the study of Protestantism,"
2041,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,a group of heresies in which the practical instincts and sentimental
2042,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"needs of the Teutonic race found expression, by throwing over more or"
2043,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,less completely the Catholic dogma and ritual. Yet in this revolution
2044,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"the Protestants maintained, or rather increased, the intensity of their"
2045,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"religious consciousness, chiefly by absorbing the elements of Hebrew"
2046,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,law and prophecy which they could find in the Bible and casting into
2047,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,that traditional form their personal conscience or their national
2048,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,ideals.
2049,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2050,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"How inadequate, on the other hand, this Hebraic element would have"
2051,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"been to constitute the supernatural religion that was now needed,"
2052,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"appears very clearly from the case of Philo Judæus. Here was a man,"
2053,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"heir to all the piety and fervour of his race, who at the same time"
2054,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"was a Neo-Platonist three hundred years before Plotinus and, as it"
2055,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"were, the first Father of the Church. But his religion, being national,"
2056,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"was not communicable and, being positivistic, was at fundamental odds"
2057,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"with the spirit of his philosophy. It remained, therefore, as a merely"
2058,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"personal treasure and heirloom, the possession of his private life:"
2059,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"his disciples, had he had any, must either have been Jews themselves"
2060,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,or else must have been the followers merely of his philosophy. His
2061,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"religion could not have passed to them; they would have regarded it, as"
2062,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"we might regard the Christianity of Kant or the wife-worship of Comte,"
2063,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"as a private circumstance, a detached trait, less damaging, perhaps, to"
2064,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,his philosophy than favourable to his loyal heart.
2065,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2066,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Philo, in his commentaries on the Bible, sought to envelop and"
2067,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,transform every detail in the light of Platonic metaphysics. His
2068,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"interpretations are often violent, but the ingenuous artifice of them"
2069,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"would have delighted his contemporaries as much as himself, and was"
2070,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,adopted afterward by all the Fathers and theologians of the Church.
2071,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Philo's theology was thus a success, even a model; yet he failed,"
2072,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"because of the inadequacy of his religion. What interest, what"
2073,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"relevance, could it have for any Gentile to hear about the deliverance"
2074,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"of Israel out of Egypt or out of Babylon, or about circumcision and"
2075,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"prescribed meats, or about the sacrifices in the Temple? What charm or"
2076,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"credibility could he find in further promises of glorious kingdoms,"
2077,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,flowing with milk and honey? Such images might later appeal to the
2078,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,imagination of New England Puritans and make a religion for them: but
2079,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,what meaning could they have to the weary Pagan? No doubt the Jews
2080,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"carried with them an ideal of righteousness, and prosperity; but the"
2081,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,Gentile was sick of heroes and high priests and founders of cities.
2082,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,Stoic virtues were as vain in his eyes as Sybaritic joys. He did not
2083,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"wish his passions to be flattered, not even his pride or the passion"
2084,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,for a social Utopia. He wished his passions to be mortified and his
2085,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"soul to be redeemed. He would not look for a Messiah, unless he could"
2086,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,find him on a cross.
2087,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2088,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"That is the essence of the matter. What overcame the world, because"
2089,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"it was what the world desired, was not a moral reform--for that was"
2090,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,preached by every sect; not an ascetic regimen--for that was practised
2091,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,by heathen gymnosophists and Pagan philosophers; not brotherly love
2092,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,within the Church--for the Jews had and have that at least in equal
2093,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,measure; but what overcame the world was what Saint Paul said he
2094,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,would always preach: Christ and him crucified. Therein was a new
2095,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"poetry, a new ideal, a new God. Therein was the transcript of the"
2096,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"real experience of humanity, as men found it in their inmost souls"
2097,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,and as they were dimly aware of it in universal history. The moving
2098,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,power was a fable--for who stopped to question whether its elements
2099,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"were historical, if only its meaning were profound and its inspiration"
2100,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,contagious? This fable had points of attachment to real life in a
2101,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"visible brotherhood and in an extant worship, as well as in the"
2102,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,religious past of a whole people. At the same time it carried the
2103,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,imagination into a new sphere; it sanctified the poverty and sorrow at
2104,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"which Paganism had shuddered; it awakened tenderer emotions, revealed"
2105,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"more human objects of adoration, and furnished subtler instruments of"
2106,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"grace. It was a whole world of poetry descended among men, like the"
2107,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"angels at the Nativity, doubling, as it were, their habitation, so that"
2108,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,they might move through supernatural realms in the spirit while they
2109,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"walked the earth in the flesh. The consciousness of new loves, new"
2110,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"duties, fresh consolations, and luminous unutterable hopes accompanied"
2111,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,them wherever they went. They stopped willingly in the midst of their
2112,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"business for recollection, like men in love; they sought to stimulate"
2113,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"their imaginations, to focus, as it were, the long vistas of an"
2114,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,invisible landscape.
2115,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2116,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,If the importunity of affairs or of ill-subdued passions disturbed
2117,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"that dream, they could still return to it at leisure in the solitude of"
2118,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,some shrine or under the spell of some canticle or of some sacramental
2119,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,image; and meantime they could keep their faith in reserve as their
2120,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,secret and their resource. The longer the vision lasted and the
2121,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"steadier it became, the more closely, of course, was it intertwined"
2122,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,with daily acts and common affections; and as real life gradually
2123,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"enriched that vision with its suggestions, so religion in turn"
2124,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"gradually coloured common life with its unearthly light. In the saint,"
2125,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,in the soul that had become already the perpetual citizen of that
2126,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"higher sphere, nothing in this world remained without reference to the"
2127,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"other, nor was anything done save for a supernatural end. Thus the"
2128,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,redemption was actually accomplished and the soul was lifted above the
2129,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"conditions of this life, so that death itself could bring but a slight"
2130,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,and unessential change of environment.
2131,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2132,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Morbid as this species of faith may seem, visionary as it certainly"
2133,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"was, it is not to be confused with an arbitrary madness or with"
2134,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,personal illusions. Two circumstances raised this imaginative piety
2135,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"to a high dignity and made it compatible with great accomplishments,"
2136,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,both in thought and in action. In the first place the religious world
2137,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,constituted a system complete and consistent within itself. There was
2138,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"occasion within it for the exercise of reason, for the awakening and"
2139,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"discipline of emotion, for the exertion of effort. As music, for all"
2140,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"that it contains nothing of a material or practical nature, offers"
2141,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,a field for the development of human faculty and presents laws and
2142,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"conditions which, within its sphere, must be obeyed and which reward"
2143,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,obedience with the keenest and purest pleasures; so a supernatural
2144,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"religion, when it is traditional and systematic like Christianity,"
2145,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"offers another world, almost as vast and solid as the real one, in"
2146,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,which the soul may develop. In entering it we do not enter a sphere
2147,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"of arbitrary dreams, but a sphere of law where learning, experience,"
2148,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"and happiness may be gained. There is more method, more reason, in"
2149,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,such madness than in the sanity of most people. The world of the
2150,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,Christian imagination was eminently a field for moral experience; moral
2151,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"ideas were there objectified into supernatural forces, and instead of"
2152,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,being obscured as in the real world by irrational accidents formed an
2153,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"intelligible cosmos, vast, massive, and steadfast. For this reason the"
2154,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,believer in any adequate and mature supernatural religion clings to
2155,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"it with such strange tenacity and regards it as his highest heritage,"
2156,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"while the outsider, whose imagination speaks another language or is"
2157,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"dumb altogether, wonders how so wild a fiction can take root in a"
2158,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,reasonable mind.
2159,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2160,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,The other circumstance that ennobled the Christian system was that
2161,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"all its parts had some significance and poetic truth, although they"
2162,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"contained, or needed to contain, nothing empirically real. The system"
2163,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"was a great poem which, besides being well constructed in itself, was"
2164,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"allegorical of actual experience, and contained, as in a hieroglyph,"
2165,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,a very deep knowledge of the world and of the human mind. For what
2166,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"was the object that unfolded itself before the Christian imagination,"
2167,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,the vision that converted and regenerated the world? It was a picture
2168,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"of human destiny. It was an epic, containing, as it were, the moral"
2169,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,autobiography of man. The object of Pagan religion and philosophy had
2170,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"been a picture of the material cosmos, conceived as a vast animal and"
2171,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,inhabited by a multitude of individual spirits. Even the Neo-Platonists
2172,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"thought of nothing else, much as they might multiply abstract names for"
2173,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,its principles and fancifully confuse them with the spheres. It was
2174,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"always a vast, living, physical engine, a cosmos of life in which man"
2175,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"had a determinate province. His spirit, losing its personality, might"
2176,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,be absorbed into the ethereal element from which it came; but this
2177,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"emanation and absorption was itself an unchanging process, the systole"
2178,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,and diastole of the universal heart. Practical religion consisted in
2179,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,honouring the nearest gods and accepting from them man's apportioned
2180,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"goods, not without looking, perhaps, with a reverence that needed"
2181,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"no ritual, to the enveloping whole that prescribed to gods and men"
2182,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,their respective functions. Thus even Neo-Platonism represented man as
2183,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"a minor incident in the universe, supernatural though that universe"
2184,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,might be. The spiritual spheres were only the invisible repetitions of
2185,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"the visible, as the Platonic ideas from the beginning had been only a"
2186,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,dialectic reduplication of the objects in this world. It was against
2187,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,this allotment that the soul was rebelling. It was looking for a
2188,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,deliverance that should be not so much the consciousness of something
2189,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,higher as the hope of something better.
2190,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2191,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Now, the great characteristic of Christianity, inherited from Judaism,"
2192,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,was that its scheme was historical. Not existences but events were the
2193,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"subject of its primary interest. It presented a story, not a cosmology."
2194,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"It was an epic in which there was, of course, superhuman machinery,"
2195,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"but of which the subject was man, and, notable circumstance, the Hero"
2196,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"was a man as well. Like Buddhism, it gave the highest honour to a"
2197,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,man who could lead his fellow-men to perfection. What had previously
2198,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,been the divine reality--the engine of Nature--now became a temporary
2199,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"stage, built for the exigencies of a human drama. What had been before"
2200,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,a detail of the edifice--the life of man--now became the argument and
2201,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"purpose of the whole creation. Notable transformation, on which the"
2202,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,philosopher cannot meditate too much.
2203,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2204,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,Was Christianity right in saying that the world was made for man? Was
2205,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,the account it adopted of the method and causes of Creation conceivably
2206,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"correct? Was the garden of Eden a historical reality, and were the"
2207,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,Hebrew prophecies announcements of the advent of Jesus Christ? Did the
2208,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"deluge come because of man's wickedness, and will the last day coincide"
2209,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"with the dramatic denouement of the Church's history? In other words,"
2210,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,is the spiritual experience of man the explanation of the universe?
2211,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Certainly not, if we are thinking of a scientific, not of a poetical"
2212,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"explanation. As a matter of fact, man is a product of laws which"
2213,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"must also destroy him, and which, as Spinoza would say, infinitely"
2214,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,exceed him in their scope and power. His welfare is indifferent to
2215,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"the stars, but dependent on them. And yet that counter-Copernican"
2216,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,revolution accomplished by Christianity--a revolution which Kant should
2217,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,hardly have attributed to himself--which put man in the centre of the
2218,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"universe and made the stars circle about him, must have some kind of"
2219,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,justification. And indeed its justification (if we may be so brief on
2220,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,so great a subject) is that what is false in the science of facts may
2221,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,be true in the science of values. While the existence of things must
2222,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"be understood by referring them to their causes, which are mechanical,"
2223,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,their functions can only be explained by what is interesting in their
2224,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"results, in other words, by their relation to human nature and to"
2225,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,human happiness.
2226,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2227,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,The Christian drama was a magnificent poetic rendering of this side
2228,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"of the matter, a side which Socrates had envisaged by his admirable"
2229,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"method, but which now flooded the consciousness of mankind with"
2230,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"torrential emotions. Christianity was born under an eclipse, when the"
2231,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,light of Nature was obscured; but the star that intercepted that light
2232,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"was itself luminous, and shed on succeeding ages a moonlike radiance,"
2233,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"paler and sadder than the other, but no less divine, and meriting no"
2234,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"less to be eternal. Man now studied his own destiny, as he had before"
2235,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"studied the sky, and the woods, and the sunny depths of water; and as"
2236,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,the earlier study produced in his soul--_anima naturaliter poeta_--the
2237,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"images of Zeus, Pan, and Nereus, so the later study produced the"
2238,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"images of Jesus and of Mary, of Heaven and Hell, of miracles and"
2239,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"sacraments. The observation was no less exact, the translation into"
2240,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,poetic images no less wonderful here than there. To trace the endless
2241,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"transfiguration, with all its unconscious ingenuity and harmony, might"
2242,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,be the theme of a fascinating science. Let not the reader fancy that in
2243,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,Christianity everything was settled by records and traditions. The idea
2244,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,of Christ himself had to be constructed by the imagination in response
2245,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"to moral demands, tradition giving only the barest external points"
2246,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,of attachment. The facts were nothing until they became symbols; and
2247,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,nothing could turn them into symbols except an eager imagination on the
2248,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,watch for all that might embody its dreams.
2249,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2250,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"The crucifixion, for example, would remain a tragic incident without"
2251,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"further significance, if we regard it merely as a historical fact; to"
2252,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"make it a religious mystery, an idea capable of converting the world,"
2253,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,the moral imagination must transform it into something that happens for
2254,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"the sake of the soul, so that each believer may say to himself that"
2255,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,Christ so suffered for the love of him. And such a thought is surely
2256,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,the objectification of an inner impulse; the idea of Christ becomes
2257,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"something spiritual, something poetical. What literal meaning could"
2258,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,there be in saying that one man or one God died for the sake of each
2259,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,and every other individual? By what effective causal principle could
2260,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"their salvation be thought to necessitate his death, or his death to"
2261,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,make possible their salvation? By an [Greek: usteron proteron] natural
2262,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,to the imagination; for in truth the matter is reversed. Christ's death
2263,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"is a symbol of human life. Men could ""believe in"" his death, because"
2264,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,it was a figure and premonition of the burden of their experience.
2265,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"That is why, when some Apostle told them the story, they could say to"
2266,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"him: ""Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet: thou hast told me all"
2267,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"things whatsoever I have felt."" Thus the central fact of all Christ's"
2268,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"history, narrated by every Evangelist, could still be nothing but a"
2269,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"painful incident, as unessential to the Christian religion as the death"
2270,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"of Socrates to the Socratic philosophy, were it not transformed by"
2271,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,the imagination of the believer into the counterpart of his own moral
2272,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"need. Then, by ceasing to be viewed as a historical fact, the death of"
2273,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,Christ becomes a religious inspiration. The whole of Christian doctrine
2274,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"is thus religious and efficacious only when it becomes poetry, because"
2275,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,only then is it the felt counterpart of personal experience and a
2276,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,genuine expansion of human life.
2277,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2278,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Take, as another example, the doctrine of eternal rewards and"
2279,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,punishments. Many perplexed Christians of our day try to reconcile
2280,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,this spirited fable with their modern horror of physical suffering and
2281,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,their detestation of cruelty; and it must be admitted that the image
2282,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,of men suffering unending tortures in retribution for a few ignorant
2283,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"and sufficiently wretched sins is, even as poetry, somewhat repellent."
2284,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,The idea of torments and vengeance is happily becoming alien to our
2285,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,society and is therefore not a natural vehicle for our religion. Some
2286,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"accordingly reject altogether the Christian doctrine on this point,"
2287,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"which is too strong for their nerves. Their objection, of course, is"
2288,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,not simply that there is no evidence of its truth. If they asked for
2289,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"evidence, would they believe anything? Proofs are the last thing"
2290,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,looked for by a truly religious mind which feels the imaginative
2291,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"fitness of its faith and knows instinctively that, in such a matter,"
2292,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,imaginative fitness is all that can be required. The reason men reject
2293,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,the doctrine of eternal punishment is that they find it distasteful
2294,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"or unmeaning. They show, by the nature of their objections, that they"
2295,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,acknowledge poetic propriety or moral truth to be the sole criterion of
2296,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,religious credibility.
2297,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2298,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"But, passing over the change of sentiment which gives rise to"
2299,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"this change of doctrine, let us inquire of what reality Christian"
2300,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,eschatology was the imaginative rendering. What was it in the actual
2301,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,life of men that made them think of themselves as hanging between
2302,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"eternal bliss and eternal perdition? Was it not the diversity, the"
2303,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"momentousness, and the finality of their experience here? No doubt"
2304,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,the desire to make the reversal of the injustices of this world as
2305,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,melodramatic and picturesque as possible contributed to the adoption
2306,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,of this idea; the ideal values of life were thus contrasted with its
2307,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,apparent values in the most absolute and graphic manner. But we may
2308,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"say that beneath this motive, based on the exigences of exposition"
2309,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"and edification, there was a deeper intuition. There was the genuine"
2310,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,moralist's sympathy with a philosophic and logical view of immortality
2311,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,rather than with a superstitious and sentimental one. Another life
2312,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,exists and is infinitely more important than this life; but it is
2313,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"reached by the intuition of ideals, not by the multiplication of"
2314,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,phenomena; it is an eternal state not an indefinite succession of
2315,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,changes. Transitory life ends for the Christian when the balance-sheet
2316,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"of his individual merits and demerits is made up, and the eternity that"
2317,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,ensues is the eternal reality of those values.
2318,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2319,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"For the Oriental, who believed in transmigration, the individual"
2320,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,dissolved into an infinity of phases; he went on actually and
2321,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"perpetually, as Nature does; his immortality was a long Purgatory"
2322,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,behind which a shadowy Hell and Heaven scarcely appeared in the form
2323,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,of annihilation or absorption. This happened because the Oriental mind
2324,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,has no middle; it oscillates between extremes and passes directly from
2325,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"sense to mysticism, and back again; it lacks virile understanding and"
2326,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"intelligence creative of form. But Christianity, following in this"
2327,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"the Socratic philosophy, rose to the conception of eternal essences,"
2328,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,forms suspended above the flux of natural things and expressing the
2329,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"ideal suggestions and rational goals of experience. Each man, for"
2330,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Christianity, has an immortal soul; each life has the potentiality of"
2331,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"an eternal meaning, and as this potentiality is or is not actualized,"
2332,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,as this meaning is or is not expressed in the phenomena of this
2333,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"life, the soul is eternally saved or lost. As the tree falleth, so"
2334,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"it lieth. The finality of this brief and personal experiment, the"
2335,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,consequent awful solemnity of the hour of death when all trial is over
2336,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"and when the eternal sentence is passed, has always been duly felt"
2337,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"by the Christian. The Church, indeed, in answer to the demand for a"
2338,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"more refined and discriminating presentation of its dogma, introduced"
2339,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"the temporary discipline of Purgatory, in which the virtues already"
2340,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,stamped on the soul might be brought to greater clearness and rid of
2341,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,the alloy of imperfection; but this purification allowed no essential
2342,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"development, no change of character or fate; the soul in Purgatory was"
2343,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"already saved, already holy."
2344,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2345,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,The harshness of the doctrine of eternal judgment is therefore a
2346,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,consequence of its symbolic truth. The Church might have been less
2347,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"absolute in the matter had she yielded more, as she did in the doctrine"
2348,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"of Purgatory, to the desire for merely imaginary extensions of human"
2349,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"experience. But her better instincts kept her, after all, to the"
2350,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,moral interpretation of reality; and the facts to be rendered were
2351,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"uncompromising enough. Art is long, life brief. To have told men they"
2352,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,would have infinite opportunities to reform and to advance would have
2353,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"been to feed them on gratuitous fictions without raising them, as it"
2354,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"was the function of Christianity to do, to a consciousness of the"
2355,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,spiritual meaning and upshot of existence. To have speculated about the
2356,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"infinite extent of experience and its endless transformations, after"
2357,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"the manner of the barbarous religions, and never to have conceived"
2358,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"its moral essence, would have been to encourage a dream which may by"
2359,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"chance be prophetic, but which is as devoid of ideal meaning as of"
2360,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,empirical probability. Christian fictions were at least significant;
2361,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"they beguiled the intellect, no doubt, and were mistaken for accounts"
2362,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,of external fact; but they enlightened the imagination; they made
2363,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"man understand, as never before or since, the pathos and nobility of"
2364,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"his life, the necessity of discipline, the possibility of sanctity,"
2365,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,the transcendence and the humanity of the divine. For the divine
2366,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,was reached by the idealization of the human. The supernatural was
2367,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"an allegory of the natural, and rendered the values of transitory"
2368,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,things under the image of eternal existences. Thus the finality of
2369,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"our activity in this world, together with the eternity of its ideal"
2370,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"meanings, was admirably rendered by the Christian dogma of a final"
2371,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,judgment.
2372,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2373,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,But there was another moral truth which was impressed upon the believer
2374,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,by that doctrine and which could not be enforced in any other way
2375,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,without presupposing in him an unusual philosophic acumen and elevation
2376,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,of mind. That is the truth that moral distinctions are absolute. A
2377,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"cool philosophy suffices to show us that moral distinctions exist,"
2378,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,since men prefer some experiences to others and can by their action
2379,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,bring these good and evil experiences upon themselves and upon their
2380,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,fellows. But a survey of Nature may at the same time impress us with
2381,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"the fact that these goods and evils are singularly mixed, that there"
2382,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"is hardly an advantage gained which is not bought by some loss, or any"
2383,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,loss which is not an opportunity for the attainment of some advantage.
2384,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,While it would be chimerical to pretend that such compensation was
2385,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"always adequate, and that, in consequence, no one condition was ever"
2386,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"really preferable to any other, yet the perplexities into which moral"
2387,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,aspiration is thrown by these contradictory vistas is often productive
2388,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"of the desire to reach some other point of view, to escape into what"
2389,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,is irrationally thought to be a higher category than the moral. The
2390,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,serious consideration of those things which are right according to
2391,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,human reason and interest may then yield to a fanatical reliance on
2392,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,some facile general notion.
2393,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2394,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"It may be thought, for instance, that what is regular or necessary"
2395,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,or universal is therefore right and good; thus a dazed contemplation
2396,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,of the actual may take the place of the determination of the ideal.
2397,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Mysticism in regard to the better and the worse, by which good and bad"
2398,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,are woven into a seamless garment of sorry magnificence in which the
2399,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"whole universe is wrapped up, is like mysticism on other subjects; it"
2400,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"consists in the theoretic renunciation of a natural attitude, in this"
2401,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,case of the natural attitude of welcome and repulsion in the presence
2402,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,of various things. But this category is the most fundamental of all
2403,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"those that the human mind employs, and it cannot be surrendered so"
2404,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,long as life endures. It is indeed the conscious echo of those vital
2405,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,instincts by whose operation we exist. Levity and mysticism may do all
2406,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,they can--and they can do much--to make men think moral distinctions
2407,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"unauthoritative, because moral distinctions may be either ignored or"
2408,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,transcended. Yet the essential assertion that one thing is really
2409,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,better than another remains involved in every act of every living
2410,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"being. It is involved even in the operation of abstract thinking, where"
2411,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"a cogent conclusion, being still coveted, is assumed to be a good, or"
2412,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"in that æsthetic and theoretic enthusiasm before cosmic laws, which is"
2413,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,the human foundation of this mysticism itself.
2414,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2415,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"It is accordingly a moral truth which no subterfuge can elude, that"
2416,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,some things are really better than others. In the daily course of
2417,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,affairs we are constantly in the presence of events which by turning
2418,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"out one way or the other produce a real, an irrevocable, increase of"
2419,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"good or evil in the world. The complexities of life, struggling as it"
2420,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"does amidst irrational forces, may make the attainment of one good"
2421,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,the cause of the unattainableness of another; they cannot destroy
2422,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,the essential desirability of both. The niggardliness of Nature
2423,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,cannot sterilize the ideal; the odious circumstances which make the
2424,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"attainment of many goods conditional on the perpetration of some evil,"
2425,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"and which punish every virtue by some incapacity or some abuse,--these"
2426,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"odious circumstances cannot rob any good of its natural sweetness, nor"
2427,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,all goods together of their conceptual harmony. To the heart that has
2428,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"felt it and that is the true judge, every loss is irretrievable and"
2429,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,every joy indestructible. Eventual compensations may obliterate the
2430,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,memory of these values but cannot destroy their reality. The future can
2431,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,only furnish further applications of the principle by which they arose
2432,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,and were justified.
2433,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2434,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Now, how utter this moral truth imaginatively, how clothe it in an"
2435,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,image that might render its absoluteness and its force? Could any
2436,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,method be better than to say: Your eternal destiny is hanging in
2437,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"the balance: the grace of God, the influences of others, and your"
2438,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,own will reacting upon both are shaping at every moment issues of
2439,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,absolute importance. What happens here and now decides not merely
2440,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,incidental pains and pleasures--which perhaps a brave and careless
2441,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,spirit might alike despise--but helps to determine your eternal
2442,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"destiny of joy or anguish, and the eternal destiny of your neighbour."
2443,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"In place of the confused vistas of the empirical world, in which the"
2444,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"threads of benefit and injury might seem to be mingled and lost, the"
2445,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,imagination substituted the clear vision of Hell and Heaven; while
2446,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,the determination of our destiny was made to depend upon obedience to
2447,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,recognized duties.
2448,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2449,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,Now these duties may often have been far from corresponding to those
2450,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,which reason would impose; but the intention and the principle at least
2451,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,were sound. It was felt that the actions and passions of this world
2452,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"breed momentous values, values which being ideal are as infinite as"
2453,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"values can be in the estimation of reason--the values of truth, of"
2454,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"love, of rationality, of perfection--although both the length of the"
2455,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,experience in which they arise and the number of persons who share
2456,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,that experience may be extremely limited. But the mechanical measure
2457,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"of experience in length, intensity, or multiplication has nothing to"
2458,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,do with its moral significance in realizing truth or virtue. Therefore
2459,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,the difference in dignity between the satisfactions of reason and
2460,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,the satisfactions of sense is fittingly rendered by the infinite
2461,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,disproportion between heavenly and earthly joys. In our imaginative
2462,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,translation we are justified in saying that the alternative between
2463,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"infinite happiness and infinite misery is yawning before us, because"
2464,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,the alternative between rational failure or success is actually
2465,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"present. The decisions we make from moment to moment, on which the"
2466,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"ideal value of our life and character depends, actually constitute in a"
2467,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,few years a decision which is irrevocable.
2468,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2469,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,The Christian doctrine of rewards and punishments is thus in harmony
2470,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,with moral truths which a different doctrine might have obscured.
2471,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,The good souls that wish to fancy that everybody will be ultimately
2472,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"saved, subject a fable to standards appropriate to matters of fact,"
2473,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,and thereby deprive the fable of that moral significance which is its
2474,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"excuse for being. If every one is ultimately saved, there is nothing"
2475,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,truly momentous about alternative events: all paths lead more or less
2476,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,circuitously to the same end. The only ground which then remains
2477,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,for discriminating the better from the worse is the pleasantness or
2478,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"unpleasantness of the path to salvation. All moral meanings inhere,"
2479,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"then, in this life, and the other life is without significance. Heaven"
2480,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,comes to replace life empirically without fulfilling it ideally. We are
2481,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"reduced for our moral standards to phenomenal values, to the worth of"
2482,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"life in transitory feeling. These values are quite real, but they are"
2483,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,not those which poetry and religion have for their object. They are
2484,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"values present to sense, not to reason and imagination."
2485,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2486,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,The ideal of a supervening general bliss presents indeed an abstract
2487,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"desideratum, but not the ideal involved in the actual forces of life;"
2488,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,that end would have no rational relation to its primary factors; it
2489,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,would not be built on our instinctive preferences but would abolish
2490,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"them by a miraculous dream, following alike upon every species of"
2491,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,activity. Moral differences would have existed merely to be forgotten;
2492,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"for if we say they were remembered, but transcended and put to rest,"
2493,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,we plunge into an even worse contradiction to the conscience and the
2494,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"will. For if we say that the universal bliss consists in the assurance,"
2495,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"mystically received, that while individual experiences may differ in"
2496,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"value they all equally conduce to the perfection of the universe, we"
2497,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,deny not merely the momentousness but even the elementary validity of
2498,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,moral distinctions. We assert that the best idea of God is that least
2499,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"like the ideal of man, and that the nearer we come to the vision of"
2500,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,truth the farther we are from the feeling of preference. In our attempt
2501,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,to extend the good we thus abolish its essence. Our religion consists
2502,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"in denying the authority of the ideal, which is its only rational"
2503,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"foundation; and thus that religion, while gaining nothing in empirical"
2504,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"reality, comes to express a moral falsehood instead of a moral truth."
2505,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2506,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"If we looked in religion for an account of facts, as most people do,"
2507,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,we should have to pass a very different judgment on these several
2508,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,views. The mechanical world is a connected system and Nature seems
2509,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,to be dynamically one; the intuitions on which mysticism feeds are
2510,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,therefore true intuitions. The expectation of a millennium is on the
2511,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"other hand quite visionary, because the evidence of history, while it"
2512,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"shows undeniable progress in many directions, shows that this progress"
2513,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"is essentially relative, partial, and transitory. As for the Christian"
2514,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"doctrine of the judgment, it is something wholly out of relation to"
2515,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"empirical facts, it assumes the existence of a supernatural sphere, and"
2516,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,is beyond the reach of scientific evidence of any kind. But if we look
2517,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"on religion as on a kind of poetry, as we have decided here to do,--as"
2518,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,on a kind of poetry that expresses moral values and reacts beneficently
2519,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"upon life,--we shall see that the Christian doctrine is alone"
2520,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,justified. For mysticism is not an imaginative construction at all but
2521,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,a renunciation or confusion of our faculties; here a surrender of the
2522,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"human ideal in the presence of a mechanical force that is felt, and"
2523,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"correctly felt, to tend to vaguer results or rather to tend to nothing"
2524,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,in particular. Mysticism is not a religion but a religious disease.
2525,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"The idea of universal salvation, on the other hand, is the expression"
2526,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"of a feeble sentimentality, a pleasant reverie without structure or"
2527,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,significance. But the doctrine of eternal rewards and punishments
2528,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"is, as we have tried to show, an expression of moral truth, a poetic"
2529,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"rendering of the fact that rational values are ideal, momentous, and"
2530,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,irreversible.
2531,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2532,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,It would be easy to multiply examples and to exhibit the various parts
2533,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,of Christianity as so many interpretations of human life in its ideal
2534,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,aspects. But we are not attempting to narrate facts so much as to
2535,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"advance an idea, and the illustrations given will perhaps suffice"
2536,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"to make our conception intelligible. There is, however, a possible"
2537,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,misunderstanding which we should be careful to avoid in this dangerous
2538,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,field of philosophic interpretation. In saying that a given religion
2539,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"was the poetic transformation of an experience, we must not imagine"
2540,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,that it was thought to be such--for it is evident that every sincere
2541,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,Christian believed in the literal and empirical reality of all that the
2542,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Christian epic contained. Nor should we imagine that philosophic ideas,"
2543,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"or general reflections on life, were the origin of religion, and that"
2544,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"afterward certain useful myths, known to be such by their authors, were"
2545,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"mistaken for history and for literal prophecy. That sometimes happens,"
2546,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"when historians, poets, or philosophers are turned by the unintelligent"
2547,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,veneration of posterity into religious prophets. Such was the fate of
2548,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Plato, for instance, or of the writer of the ""Song of Solomon""; but 110"
2549,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,great and living religion was ever founded in that way.
2550,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2551,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,Had Christianity or any other religion had its basis in literary or
2552,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"philosophical allegories, it would never have become a religion,"
2553,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,because the poetry of it would never have been interwoven with the
2554,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"figures and events of real life. No tomb, no relic, no material"
2555,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"miracle, no personal derivation of authority, would have existed to"
2556,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,serve as the nucleus of devotion and the point of junction between
2557,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,this world and the other. The origin of Christian dogma lay in historic
2558,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,facts and in doctrines literally meant by their authors. It is one of
2559,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,the greatest possible illusions in these matters to fancy that the
2560,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,meaning which we see in parables and mysteries was the meaning they had
2561,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"in the beginning, but which later misinterpretation had obscured. On"
2562,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,the contrary--as a glance at any incipient religious movement now going
2563,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"on will show us--the authors of doctrines, however obvious it may be to"
2564,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"every one else that these doctrines have only a figurative validity,"
2565,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,are the first dupes to their own intuitions. This is no less true of
2566,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,metaphysical theories than of spontaneous superstitions: did their
2567,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,promulgator understand the character of their justification he would
2568,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"give himself out for a simple poet, appeal only to cultivated minds,"
2569,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"and never turn his energies to stimulating private delusions, not to"
2570,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,speak of public fanaticisms. The best philosophers seldom perceive the
2571,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,poetic merit of their systems.
2572,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2573,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"So among the ancients it was not an abstract observation of Nature,"
2574,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"with conscious allegory supervening, that was the origin of mythology,"
2575,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"but the interpretation was spontaneous, the illusion was radical, a"
2576,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,consciousness of the god's presence was the first impression produced
2577,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"by the phenomenon. Else, in this case too, poetry would never have"
2578,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,become superstition; what made it superstition was the initial
2579,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,incapacity in people to discriminate the objects of imagination from
2580,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"those of the understanding. The fancy thus attached its images, without"
2581,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"distinguishing their ideal locus, to the visible world, and men became"
2582,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"superstitious not because they had too much imagination, but because"
2583,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,they were not aware that they had any.
2584,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2585,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"In what sense, then, are we justified in saying that religion expresses"
2586,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"moral ideals? In the sense that moral significance, while not the"
2587,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"source of religions, is the criterion of their value and the reason"
2588,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,why they may deserve to endure. Far as the conception of an allegory
2589,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"may be from the minds of prophets, yet the prophecy can only take"
2590,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,root in the popular imagination if it recommends itself to some human
2591,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,interest. There must be some correspondence between the doctrine
2592,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"announced or the hopes set forth, and the natural demands of the"
2593,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"human spirit. Otherwise, although the new faith might be preached, it"
2594,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,would not be accepted. The significance of religious doctrines has
2595,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"therefore been the condition of their spread, their maintenance, and"
2596,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"their development, although not the condition of their origin. In"
2597,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Darwinian language, moral significance has been a spontaneous variation"
2598,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"of superstition, and this variation has insured its survival as a"
2599,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,religion. For religion differs from superstition not psychologically
2600,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"but morally, not in its origin but in its worth. This worth, when"
2601,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"actually felt and appreciated, becomes of course a dynamic factor and"
2602,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,contributes like other psychological elements to the evolution of
2603,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"events; but being a logical harmony, a rational beauty, this worth is"
2604,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"only appreciable by a few minds, and those the least primitive and the"
2605,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,least capable of guiding popular movements. Reason is powerless to
2606,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"found religions, although it is alone competent to judge them. Good"
2607,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"religions are therefore the product of unconscious rationality, of"
2608,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,imaginative impulses fortunately moral.
2609,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2610,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,Particularly does this appear in the early history of Christianity.
2611,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Every shade of heresy, every kind of mixture of Christian and other"
2612,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,elements was tried and found advocates; but after a greater or less
2613,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"success they all disappeared, leaving only the Church standing. For the"
2614,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,Church had known how to combine those dogmas and practices in which
2615,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"the imagination of the time, and to a great extent of all times, might"
2616,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,find fitting expression. Imaginative significance was the touchstone
2617,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,of orthodoxy; tradition itself was tested by this standard. By this
2618,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"standard the canon of Scripture was fixed, so as neither to exclude the"
2619,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Old Testament, which the pure metaphysicians would have rejected, nor"
2620,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"to accept every gospel that circulated under the name of an apostle,"
2621,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,and which might please a wonder-loving and detail-loving piety. By
2622,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"the same criterion the ritual was composed, the dogma developed, the"
2623,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"nature of Christ defined, the sacraments and discipline of the Church"
2624,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"regulated. The result was a comprehensive system where, under the"
2625,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"shadow of a great epic, which expanded and interpreted the history"
2626,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"of mankind from the Creation to the Day of Doom, a place was found"
2627,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,for as many religious instincts and as many religious traditions as
2628,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,possible; while at the same time the dialectic proficiency of an age
2629,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"that inherited the discipline of Greek philosophy, introduced into the"
2630,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,system a great consistency and a great metaphysical subtlety. Time
2631,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"mellowed and expanded these dogmas, bringing them into relation with"
2632,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,the needs of a multiform piety; a justification was found both for
2633,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"asceticism and for a virtuous naturalism, both for contemplation and"
2634,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,for action; and thus it became possible for the Church to insinuate her
2635,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"sanctions and her spirit into the motives of men, and to embody the"
2636,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,religion of many nations during many ages.
2637,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2638,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"The Church's successes, however, were not all legitimate; they were"
2639,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,not everywhere due to a real correspondence between her forms and the
2640,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,ideal life of men. It was only the inhabitants of the Græco-Roman
2641,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"world that were quite prepared to understand her. When the sword, or"
2642,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"the authority of a higher worldly civilization, carried her influence"
2643,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,beyond the borders of the Roman Empire we may observe that her
2644,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"authority seldom proved stable. She was felt, by those peoples whose"
2645,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"imaginative traditions and whose moral experience she did not express,"
2646,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,to be something alien and artificial. The Teutonic races finally threw
2647,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,off what they felt to be her yoke. If they reconstructed their religion
2648,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"out of elements which she had furnished, that was only because religion"
2649,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"is bound to be traditional, and they had been Christians for many"
2650,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,hundred years. A wholly new philosophy or poetry could not have taken
2651,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,immediate root in their minds; even the philosophy which Germany has
2652,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"since produced, when the national spirit was reaching, so to speak, its"
2653,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"majority, hardly seems able to constitute an independent religion, but"
2654,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"takes shelter under some form of Christianity, however much the spirit"
2655,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,of that religion may be transformed.
2656,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2657,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"At first, indeed, the new movement took the Bible for its"
2658,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"starting-point. So heterogeneous a book, which was already habitually"
2659,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"interpreted in so many fanciful ways, was indeed an admirable basis"
2660,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,for the imagination to build upon. The self-reliant and dreamy Teuton
2661,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,could spin out of the Biblical chronicles and rhapsodies convictions
2662,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,after his own heart; while his fixed persuasion that the Bible was the
2663,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"word of God, was strengthened (not illegitimately) by his ability to"
2664,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,make it express his own moral ideals. The intensity of his religion was
2665,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,proportionate to the degree in which he had made it the imaginative
2666,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,rendering of his own character.
2667,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2668,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Protestantism in its vital elements was thus a perfectly new, a"
2669,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,perfectly spontaneous religion. The illusion that it was a return to
2670,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,primitive Christianity was useful for controversial purposes and helped
2671,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,to justify the iconoclastic passions of the time; but this illusion
2672,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"did not touch the true essence of Protestantism, nor the secret of its"
2673,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,legitimacy and power as a religion. This was its new embodiment of
2674,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"human ideals in imaginative forms, whereby those ideals became explicit"
2675,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,and found a remarkable expression in action. These ideals were quite
2676,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,Teutonic and looked to inner spontaneity and outward prosperity; they
2677,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,were more allied to those of the Hebrews than to those of the early
2678,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Christians, whose religion was all miracles, asceticism, and withdrawal"
2679,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,from the world. Indeed we may say that the typical Protestant was
2680,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,himself his own church and made the selection and interpretation of
2681,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,tradition according to the demands of his personal spirit. What the
2682,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Fathers did for the Church in the fourth century, the Reformers did for"
2683,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"themselves in the sixteenth, and have continued to do on the occasion"
2684,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,of their various appearances.
2685,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2686,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"If we judge this interpretation by poetic standards, we cannot"
2687,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,resist the conclusion that the old version was infinitely superior.
2688,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"The Protestant, with his personal resources, was reduced to making"
2689,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,grotesquely and partially that translation of moral life which the
2690,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Fathers had made comprehensively and beautifully, inspired as they"
2691,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,were by all the experience of antiquity and all the hopes of youthful
2692,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Christendom. Nevertheless, Protestantism has the unmistakable character"
2693,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"of a genuine religion, a character which tradition passively accepted"
2694,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"and dogma, regarded as so much external truth, may easily lose; it"
2695,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,is in correspondence with the actual ideals and instincts of the
2696,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,believer; it is the self-assertion of a living soul. Its meagreness
2697,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,and eccentricity are simply evidences of its personal basis. It is in
2698,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"full harmony with the practical impulses it comes to sanction, and"
2699,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,accordingly it gains in efficiency all that it loses in dignity and
2700,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,truth.
2701,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2702,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"The principle by which the Christian system had developed, although"
2703,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"reapplied by the Protestants to their own inner life, was not"
2704,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,understood by them in its historical applications. They had little
2705,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,sympathy with the spiritual needs and habits of that Pagan society in
2706,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,which Christianity had grown up. That society had found in Christianity
2707,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"a sort of last love, a rejuvenating supersensible hope, and had"
2708,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"bequeathed to the Gospel of Redemption, for its better embodiment and"
2709,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"ornament, all its own wealth of art, philosophy, and devotion. This"
2710,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,embodiment of Christianity represented a civilization through which
2711,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,the Teutonic races had not passed and which they never could have
2712,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,produced; it appealed to a kind of imagination and sentiment which
2713,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"was foreign to them. This embodiment, accordingly, was the object of"
2714,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"their first and fiercest attack, really because it was unsympathetic"
2715,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,to their own temperament but ostensibly because they could not find
2716,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,its basis in those Hebraic elements of Christianity which make up the
2717,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,greater bulk of the Bible. They did not value the sublime aspiration
2718,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,of Christianity to be not something Hebraic or Teutonic but something
2719,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,Catholic and human; and they blamed everything which went beyond the
2720,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,accidental limits of their own sympathies and the narrow scope of their
2721,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,own experience.
2722,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2723,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Yet it was only by virtue of this complement inherited from Paganism,"
2724,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,or at least supplied by the instincts and traditions on which Paganism
2725,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"had reposed, that Christianity could claim to approach a humane"
2726,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,universality or to achieve an imaginative adequacy. The problem was to
2727,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"compose, in the form of a cosmic epic, with metaphysical justifications"
2728,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"and effectual starting-points for moral action, the spiritual"
2729,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,autobiography of man. The central idea of this composition was to be
2730,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,the idea of a Redemption. Around this were to be gathered and moulded
2731,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"together elements drawn from Hebrew tradition and scripture, others"
2732,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"furnished by Paganism, together with all that the living imagination"
2733,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,of the time could create. Nor was it right or fitting to make a merely
2734,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,theoretical or ethical synthesis. Doctrine must find its sensible echo
2735,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"in worship, in art, in the feasts and fasts of the year. Only when"
2736,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,thus permeating life and expressing itself to every sense and faculty
2737,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,can a religion be said to have reached completion; only then has the
2738,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,imagination exhausted its means of utterance.
2739,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2740,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,The great success which Christianity achieved in this immense
2741,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"undertaking makes it, after classic antiquity, the most important phase"
2742,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"in the history of mankind. It is clear, however, that this success was"
2743,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,not complete. That fallacy from which the Pagan religion alone has
2744,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"been free, that [Greek: proton pseudos] of all fanaticism, the natural"
2745,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,but hopeless misunderstanding of imagining that poetry in order to
2746,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"be religion, in order to be the inspiration of life, must first deny"
2747,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,that it is poetry and deceive us about the facts with which we have
2748,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,to deal--this misunderstanding has marred the work of the Christian
2749,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"imagination and condemned it, if we may trust appearances, to be"
2750,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,transitory. For by this misunderstanding Christian doctrine was brought
2751,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"into conflict with reality, of which it pretends to prejudge the"
2752,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"character, and also into conflict with what might have been its own"
2753,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"elements, with all excluded religious instincts and imaginative ideals."
2754,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Human life is always essentially the same, and therefore a religion"
2755,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"which, like Christianity, seizes the essence of that life, ought to be"
2756,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,an eternal religion. But it may forfeit that privilege by entangling
2757,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"itself with a particular account of matters of fact, matters irrelevant"
2758,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"to its ideal significance, and further by intrenching itself, by"
2759,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"virtue of that entanglement, in an inadequate regimen or a too narrow"
2760,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"imaginative development, thus putting its ideal authority in jeopardy"
2761,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,by opposing it to other intuitions and practices no less religious than
2762,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,its own.
2763,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,
2764,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"Can Christianity escape these perils? Can it reform its claims, or"
2765,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,can it overwhelm all opposition and take the human heart once more by
2766,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"storm? The future alone can decide. The greatest calamity, however,"
2767,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"would be that which seems, alas! not unlikely to befall our immediate"
2768,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"posterity, namely, that while Christianity should be discredited no"
2769,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"other religion, more disillusioned and not less inspired, should come"
2770,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,to take its place. Until the imagination should have time to recover
2771,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"and to reassert its legitimate and kindly power, the European races"
2772,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,would then be reduced to confessing that while they had mastered the
2773,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"mechanical forces of Nature, both by science and by the arts, they had"
2774,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"become incapable of mastering or understanding themselves, and that,"
2775,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,bewildered like the beasts by the revolutions of the heavens and by
2776,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,"their own irrational passions, they could find no way of uttering the"
2777,THE POETRY OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA,ideal meaning of their life.

2789,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"pass into the common language of men, there does not and there cannot"
2790,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,accompany them any just appreciation of their meaning or of the long
2791,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,experience and travail of soul from which they have arisen. Few
2792,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,doctrines have suffered more by popularization than the intuitions
2793,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,of Plato. The public sees in Platonic sayings little more than
2794,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,phrases employed by unpractical minds to cloak the emptiness of their
2795,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,yearnings. Finding these fragments of an obsolete speech put to bad
2796,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"uses, we are apt to ignore and despise them, much as a modern peasant"
2797,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,might despise the fragment of a frieze or a metope which he found
2798,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,built into his cottage wall. It is not only the works of plastic art
2799,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,that moulder and disintegrate to furnish materials for the barbarous
2800,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"masons of a later age: the great edifices of reason also crumble, their"
2801,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"plan is lost, and their fragments, picked where they happen to lie,"
2802,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,become the materials of a feebler thought. In common speech we find
2803,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,such bits of ancient wisdom embedded; they prove the intelligence of
2804,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"some ancestor of ours, but are no evidence of our own. When used in"
2805,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"ignorance of their meaning, they become misplaced flourishes, lapses"
2806,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,into mystery in the businesslike plainness of our thought.
2807,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
2808,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Yet there is one man, the archæologist, to whom nothing is so"
2809,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,interesting as just these stones which a practical builder would have
2810,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,rejected. He forgives the ignorance and barbarism that placed them
2811,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,where they are; he is absorbed in studying their sculptured surface
2812,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,and delighted if his fancy can pass from them to the idea of the
2813,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,majestic whole to which they once belonged. So in the presence of a
2814,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"much-abused philosophic phrase, we may be interested in reconstructing"
2815,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,the experience which once gave it meaning and form. Words are at least
2816,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"the tombs of ideas, and the most conventional formulas of poets or"
2817,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,theologians are still good subjects for the archæologist of passion. He
2818,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,may find a treasure there; or at any rate he may hope to be rewarded
2819,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,for his labour by the ideal restoration of some once beautiful temple
2820,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,of Athena.
2821,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
2822,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,Something of this kind is what we may now attempt to do with regard to
2823,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"one or two Platonic ideas, ideas which under the often ironical title"
2824,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"of Platonic love, are constantly referred to and seldom understood."
2825,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,These ideas may be defined as the transformation of the appreciation
2826,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,of beautiful things into the worship of an ideal beauty and the
2827,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,transformation of the love of particular persons into the love of God.
2828,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,These mystical phrases may acquire a new and more human meaning if we
2829,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"understand, at least in part, how they first came to be spoken. We"
2830,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,shall then not think of them merely as the reported sayings of Plato
2831,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"or Plotinus, Porphyry or Proclus; we shall not learn them by rote, as"
2832,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"the unhappy student learns the enigmas, which, in the histories of"
2833,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"philosophy, represent all that survives of the doctrine of a Thales or"
2834,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,a Pythagoras. We shall have some notion of the ideas that once prompted
2835,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,such speech.
2836,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
2837,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,And we shall be the better able to reconstruct those conceptions
2838,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,inasmuch as the reflection by which they are bred has recurred often
2839,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"in the world--has recurred, very likely, in our own experience."
2840,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,We are often Platonists without knowing it. In some form or other
2841,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,Platonic ideas occur in all poetry of passion when it is seasoned with
2842,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"reflection. They are particularly characteristic of some Italian poets,"
2843,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,scattered from the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries. These poets
2844,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,had souls naturally Platonic; even when they had heard something of
2845,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Plato they borrowed nothing from him. They repeated his phrases, when"
2846,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"they did so, merely to throw the authority of an ancient philosopher"
2847,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,over the spontaneous suggestions of their own minds. Their Platonism
2848,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"was all their own: it was Christian, mediæval, and chivalrous, both"
2849,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,in origin and expression. But it was all the more genuine for being a
2850,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,reincarnation rather than an imitation of the old wisdom.
2851,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
2852,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Nothing, for example, could be a better object-lesson in Platonism than"
2853,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,the well-known sentimental history of Dante. There is no essential
2854,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,importance in the question whether Dante could have read anything of
2855,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Plato or come indirectly under his influence. The Platonism of Dante,"
2856,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"is, in any case, quite his own. It is the expression of his inner"
2857,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,experience moulded by the chivalry and theology of his time. He tells
2858,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"us the story himself very quaintly in the ""Vita Nuova."""
2859,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
2860,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"At the age of nine he saw, at a wedding-feast in Florence, Beatrice,"
2861,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"then a child of seven, who became, forthwith, the mistress of his"
2862,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"thoughts. This precocious passion ruled his imagination for life, so"
2863,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"that, when he brings to an end the account of the emotions she aroused"
2864,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"in him by her life and death, he tells us that he determined to speak"
2865,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"no more about her until he should be able to do so more worthily, and"
2866,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"to say of her what had never been said of any woman. In the ""Divine"
2867,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Comedy,"" accordingly, where he fulfils this promise, she appears"
2868,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"transfigured into a heavenly protectress and guide, whose gentle"
2869,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,womanhood fades into an impersonation of theological wisdom. But this
2870,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,life-long devotion of Dante to Beatrice was something purely mental
2871,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,and poetical; he never ventured to woo; he never once descended or
2872,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,sought to descend from the sphere of silent and distant adoration;
2873,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"his tenderness remained always tearful and dreamy, like that of a"
2874,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,supersensitive child.
2875,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
2876,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Yet, while his love of Beatrice was thus constant and religious, it"
2877,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,was by no means exclusive. Dante took a wife as Beatrice herself had
2878,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"taken a husband; the temptations of youth, as well as the affection"
2879,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"of married life, seem to have existed beneath this ideal love, not"
2880,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"unrebuked by it, indeed, but certainly not disturbing it. Should we be"
2881,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,surprised at this species of infidelity? Should we regard it as proof
2882,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"of the artificiality and hollowness of that so transcendental passion,"
2883,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"and smile, as people have done in the case of Plato himself, at the"
2884,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,thin disguise of philosophy that covers the most vulgar frailties of
2885,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"human nature? Or, should we say, with others, that Beatrice is a merely"
2886,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"allegorical figure, and the love she is said to inspire nothing but a"
2887,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"symbol for attachment to wisdom and virtue? These are old questions,"
2888,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"and insoluble by any positive method, since they cannot be answered by"
2889,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,the facts but only by our interpretation of them. Our solution can have
2890,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"little historical value, but it will serve to test our understanding of"
2891,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,the metaphysics of feeling.
2892,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
2893,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,To guide us in this delicate business we may appeal to a friend of
2894,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Dante, his fellow-poet Guido Cavalcanti, who will furnish us with"
2895,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"another example of this same sort of idealization, and this same sort"
2896,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"of inconstancy, expressed in a manner that will repay analysis. Guido"
2897,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,Cavalcanti had a Beatrice of his own--something of the kind was then
2898,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,expected of every gentle knight and poet--and Guido's Beatrice was
2899,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,called Giovanna. Dante seems to acknowledge the parity of his friend's
2900,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"passion with his own by coupling the names of the two ladies, Monna"
2901,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Vanna and Monna Bice, in one or two of the sonnets he addresses to"
2902,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Guido. Now it came to pass that Guido, in the fervour of his devotion,"
2903,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"at once chivalrous and religious, bethought him of making a pilgrimage"
2904,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"to the tomb of Saint James the Apostle, at Compostela in Spain."
2905,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Upon this journey--a journey beguiled, no doubt, by thoughts of the"
2906,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,beautiful Giovanna he had left in Florence--he halted in the city of
2907,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Toulouse. But at Toulouse, as chance would have it, there lived a"
2908,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"lovely lady by the name of Mandetta, with whom it was impossible for"
2909,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,the chivalrous pilgrim not to fall in love; for chivalry is nothing
2910,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,but a fine emblazoning of the original manly impulse to fight every
2911,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,man and love every woman. Now in an interesting sonnet Guido describes
2912,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"the conflict of these two affections, or perhaps we should rather say,"
2913,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,their union.
2914,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
2915,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"""There is a lady in Toulouse so fair,"
2916,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"So young, so gentle, and so chastely gay,"
2917,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,She doth a true and living likeness bear
2918,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"In her sweet eyes to Love, whom I obey."""
2919,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
2920,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"The word I have, to avoid confusion, here rendered by ""Love"" is in the"
2921,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"original ""la Donna mia,"" ""my Lady""; so that we have our poet falling in"
2922,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,love with Mandetta on account of her striking resemblance to Giovanna.
2923,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,Is this inconstancy or only a more delicate and indirect homage? We
2924,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"shall see; for Guido goes on to represent his soul, according to his"
2925,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"custom, as a being that dwells and moves about in the chambers of"
2926,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"his heart; and speaking still of Mandetta, the lady of Toulouse, he"
2927,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,continues:--
2928,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
2929,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"""Within my heart my soul, when she appeared,"
2930,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,Was filled with longing and was fain to flee
2931,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Out of my heart to her, yet was afeared"
2932,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,To tell the lady who my Love might be.
2933,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"She looked upon me with her quiet eyes,"
2934,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"And under their sweet ray my bosom burned,"
2935,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Cheered by Love's image, that within them lies."""
2936,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
2937,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,So far we have still the familiar visible in the new and making its
2938,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,power; Mandetta is still nothing but a stimulus to reawaken the memory
2939,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,of Giovanna. But before the end there is trouble. The sting of the
2940,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,present attraction is felt in contrast to the eternal ideal. There is
2941,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"a necessity of sacrifice, and he cries, as the lady turns away her"
2942,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,eyes:--
2943,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
2944,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"""Alas! they shot an arrow as she turned,"
2945,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,And with a death-wound from the piercing dart
2946,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"My soul came sighing back into my heart."""
2947,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
2948,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,Perhaps this merely means that the lady was disdainful; had she been
2949,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"otherwise the poet might never have written sonnets about her, and"
2950,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,surely not sonnets in which her charms were reduced to a Platonic
2951,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,reminiscence of a fairer ideal. But it is this turning away of the
2952,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"face of love, this ephemeral quality of its embodiments, that usually"
2953,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,stimulates the imagination to the construction of a supersensible ideal
2954,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,in which all those evaporated impulses may meet again and rest in an
2955,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"adequate and permanent object. So that while Guido's ""death-wound"" was"
2956,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,perhaps in reality nothing but the rebuff offered him by a prospective
2957,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"mistress, yet the sting of it, in a mind of Platonic habit, served"
2958,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"at once to enforce the distinction between the ideal beauty, so full"
2959,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"of sweetness and heavenly charm, which had tempted the soul out of"
2960,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"his heart on its brief adventure, and the particular and real object"
2961,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"against which the soul was dashed, and from which it returned bruised"
2962,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,and troubled to its inward solitude.
2963,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
2964,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,So the meditative Guido represents his experience: a new planet swam
2965,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,into his ken radiant with every grace and virtue; yet all the magic
2966,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"of that lady lay in her resemblance to the mysterious Giovanna, the"
2967,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"double of Beatrice, the ideal of the poet's imagination. The soul, at"
2968,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"first, went out eagerly to the new love as to an image and embodiment"
2969,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"of the old, but was afraid, and justly, to mention the ideal in the"
2970,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,presence of the reality. There is always danger in doing that; it
2971,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,breaks the spell and reduces us again to the old and patient loyalty to
2972,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,the unseen. The present thing being so like the ideal we unhesitatingly
2973,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"pursue it: but we are quickly disappointed, and the soul returns"
2974,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"sighing and mortally wounded, as the new object of passion fades away."
2975,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
2976,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,We may now understand somewhat better that strange combination of
2977,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,loyalty and disloyalty which we find in Dante. While the object of
2978,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"love is any particular thing, it excludes all others; but it includes"
2979,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,all others as soon as it becomes a general ideal. All beauties attract
2980,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,by suggesting the ideal and then fail to satisfy by not fulfilling
2981,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"it. While Giovanna remained a woman, Guido, as his after life plainly"
2982,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"showed, had no difficulty in forgetting her and in loving many others"
2983,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,with a frank heart; but when Giovanna had become a name for the
2984,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"absolute ideal, that sovereign mistress could never be forgotten, and"
2985,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,the thought of her subordinated every particular attachment and called
2986,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"the soul away from it. Compared with the ideal, every human perfection"
2987,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"becomes a shadow and a deceit; every mortal passion leaves, as Keats"
2988,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"has told us,"
2989,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
2990,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"""A heart high-sorrowful and cloyed,"
2991,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"A burning forehead and a parching tongue."""
2992,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
2993,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Such is the nature of idealization. Like the Venus of Apelles, in"
2994,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"which all known beauties were combined, the ideal is the union of"
2995,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,all we prize in all creatures; and the mind that has once felt the
2996,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,irresistible compulsion to create this ideal and to believe in it has
2997,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,become incapable of unreserved love of anything else. The absolute
2998,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,is a jealous god; it is a consuming fire that blasts the affections
2999,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"upon which it feeds. For this reason the soul of Guido, in his sonnet,"
3000,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,is mortally wounded by the shaft of that beauty which has awakened a
3001,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,vehement longing for perfection without being able to satisfy it. All
3002,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,things become to the worshipper of the ideal so many signs and symbols
3003,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"of what he seeks; like the votary who, kneeling now before one image"
3004,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"and now before another, lets his incense float by all with a certain"
3005,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"abstracted impartiality, because his aspiration mounts through them"
3006,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,equally to the invisible God they alike represent.
3007,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3008,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Another aspect of the same process is well described by Shakespeare, in"
3009,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"whom Italian influences count for much, when he says to the person he"
3010,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,has chosen as the object of his idealization:--
3011,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3012,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"""Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts"
3013,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Which I, by lacking, have supposed dead,"
3014,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,And there reigns love and all love's loving parts
3015,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,And all those friends which I thought buried.
3016,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,How many a holy and obsequious tear
3017,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,Hath dear religious love stolen from mine eye
3018,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"As interest for the dead, which now appear"
3019,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"But things removed, which hidden in thee lie."
3020,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,Thou art the grave where buried love doth live
3021,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,"
3022,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,Who all their parts of me to thee did give:
3023,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,That due of many now is thine alone.
3024,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Their images I loved I view in thee,"
3025,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"And thou, all they, hast all the all of me."""
3026,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3027,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"We need not, then, waste erudition in trying to prove whether Dante's"
3028,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,Beatrice or Guido's Giovanna or any one else who has been the subject
3029,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"of the greater poetry of love, was a symbol or a reality. To poets and"
3030,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,philosophers real things are themselves symbols. The child of seven
3031,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"whom Dante saw at the Florentine feast was, if you will, a reality. As"
3032,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,such she is profoundly unimportant. To say that Dante loved her then
3033,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,and ever after is another way of saying that she was a symbol to him.
3034,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,That is the way with childish loves. Neither the conscious spell of the
3035,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"senses nor the affinities of taste and character can then be powerful,"
3036,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,but the sense of loneliness and the vague need of loving may easily
3037,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,conspire with the innocence of the eyes to fix upon a single image and
3038,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,to make it the imaginary goal of all those instincts which as yet do
3039,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,not know themselves.
3040,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3041,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,When with time these instincts become explicit and select their
3042,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"respective objects, if the inmost heart still remains unsatisfied, as"
3043,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"it must in all profound or imaginative natures, the name and memory"
3044,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,of that vague early love may well subsist as a symbol for the perfect
3045,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,good yet unattained. It is intelligible that as time goes on that
3046,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"image, grown thus consciously symbolic, should become interchangeable"
3047,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"with the abstract method of pursuing perfection--that Beatrice, that"
3048,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"is, should become the same as sacred theology. Having recognized that"
3049,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,she was to his childish fancy what the ideals of religion were to his
3050,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"mature imagination, Dante intentionally fused the two, as every poet"
3051,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"intentionally fuses the general and the particular, the universal and"
3052,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"the personal. Beatrice thenceforth appeared, as Plato wished that our"
3053,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"loves should, as a manifestation of absolute beauty and as an avenue of"
3054,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,divine grace. Dante merely added his Christian humility and tenderness
3055,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,to the insight of the Pagan philosopher.
3056,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3057,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"The tendency to impersonality, we see, is essential to the ideal. It"
3058,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,could not fulfil its functions if it retained too many of the traits
3059,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"of any individual. A blind love, an unreasoning passion, is therefore"
3060,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"inconsistent with the Platonic spirit, which is favourable rather to"
3061,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"abstraction from persons and to admiration of qualities. These may, of"
3062,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"course, be found in many individuals. Too much subjection to another"
3063,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"personality makes the expression of our own impossible, and the ideal"
3064,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,is nothing but a projection of the demands of our imagination. If
3065,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"the imagination is over-powered by too strong a fascination, by the"
3066,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"absolute dominion of an alien influence, we form no ideal at all. We"
3067,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,must master a passion before we can see its meaning.
3068,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3069,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"For this reason, among others, we find so little Platonism in that"
3070,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,poet in whom we might have expected to find most--I mean in Petrarch.
3071,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Petrarch is musical, ingenious, learned, and passionate, but he is"
3072,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,weak. His art is greater than his thought. In the quality of his mind
3073,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,there is nothing truly distinguished. The discipline of his long and
3074,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"hopeless love brings him little wisdom, little consolation. He is"
3075,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"lachrymose and sentimental at the end as at the beginning, and his best"
3076,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"dream of heaven, expressed, it is true, in entrancing verse, is only to"
3077,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"hold his lady's hand and hear her voice. Sometimes, indeed, he repeats"
3078,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"what he must have read and heard so often, and gives us his version of"
3079,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Plato in half a sonnet. Thus, for instance, speaking of his love for"
3080,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Laura, he says in one place:--"
3081,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3082,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"""Hence comes the understanding of love's scope"
3083,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"That seeking her to perfect good aspires,"
3084,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,Accounting little what all flesh desires;
3085,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,And hence the spirit's happy pinions ope
3086,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"In flight impetuous to the heaven's choirs,"
3087,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Wherefore I walk already proud in hope."""
3088,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3089,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"If we are looking, however, for more direct expressions of the idealism"
3090,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"of feeling, of love, and the sense of beauty passing into religion,"
3091,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"we shall do well to turn to another Italian, not so great a poet as"
3092,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Petrarch by any means, but a far greater man--to Michael Angelo."
3093,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Michael Angelo justly regarded himself as essentially a sculptor, and"
3094,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,said even of painting that it was not his art; his verses are therefore
3095,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"both laboured and rough. Yet they have been too much neglected, for"
3096,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"they breathe the same pathos of strength, the same agony in hope, as"
3097,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,his Titanic designs.
3098,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3099,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Like every Italian of culture in those days, Michael Angelo was in the"
3100,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"habit of addressing little pieces to his friends, and of casting his"
3101,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,thoughts or his prayers into the mould of a sonnet or a madrigal. Verse
3102,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,has a greater naturalness and a wider range among the Latin peoples
3103,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,than among the English; poetry and prose are less differentiated. In
3104,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"French, Italian, and Spanish, as in Latin itself, elegance and neatness"
3105,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,of expression suffice for verse. The reader passes without any sense of
3106,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"incongruity or anti-climax from passion to reflection, from sentiment"
3107,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"to satire, from flights of fancy to homely details: the whole has a"
3108,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,certain human sincerity and intelligibility which weld it together.
3109,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"As the Latin languages are not composed of two diverse elements, as"
3110,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"English is of Latin and German, so the Latin mind does not have two"
3111,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"spheres of sentiment, one vulgar and the other sublime. All changes"
3112,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"are variations on a single key, which is the key of intelligence. We"
3113,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"must not be surprised, therefore, to find now a message to a friend,"
3114,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"now an artistic maxim, now a bit of dialectic, and now a confession of"
3115,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"sin, taking the form of verse and filling out the fourteen lines of a"
3116,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"sonnet. On the contrary, we must look to these familiar compositions"
3117,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,for the most genuine evidence of a man's daily thoughts.
3118,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3119,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"We find in Michael Angelo's poems a few recurring ideas, or rather the"
3120,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"varied expression of a single half æsthetic, half religious creed."
3121,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"The soul, he tells us in effect, is by nature made for God and for"
3122,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,the enjoyment of divine beauty. All true beauty leads to the idea of
3123,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"perfection; the effort toward perfection is the burden of all art,"
3124,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"which labours, therefore, with a superhuman and insoluble problem."
3125,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"All love, also, that does not lead to the love of God and merge into"
3126,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"that love, is a long and hopeless torment; while the light of love is"
3127,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"already the light of heaven, the fire of love is already the fire of"
3128,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"hell. These are the thoughts that perpetually recur, varied now with"
3129,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"a pathetic reference to the poet's weariness and old age, now with an"
3130,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"almost despairing appeal for divine mercy, often with a powerful and"
3131,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"rugged description of the pangs of love, and with a pious acceptance"
3132,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"of its discipline. The whole is intense, exalted, and tragic, haunted"
3133,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"by something of that profound terror, of that magnificent strength,"
3134,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"which we admire in the figures of the Sixtine Chapel, those noble"
3135,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,agonies of beings greater than any we find in this world.
3136,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3137,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"What, we may ask, is all this tragedy about? What great sorrow,"
3138,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"what great love, had Michael Angelo or his giants that they writhe"
3139,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,so supernaturally As those decorative youths are sprinkled over the
3140,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Sixtine vault, filled, we know not why, with we know not what emotion,"
3141,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"so these scraps of verse, these sibylline leaves of Michael Angelo's,"
3142,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,give us no reason for their passion. They tell no story; there seems to
3143,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,have been no story to tell. There is something impersonal and elusive
3144,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,about the subject and occasion of these poems. Attempts have been made
3145,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"to attribute them to discreditable passions, as also to a sentimental"
3146,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,love for Vittoria Colonna. But the friendship with Vittoria Colonna
3147,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,was an incident of Michael Angelo's mature years; some of the sonnets
3148,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"and madrigals are addressed to her, but we cannot attribute to her"
3149,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,influence the passion and sorrow that seem to permeate them all.
3150,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3151,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,Perhaps there is less mystery in this than the curious would have us
3152,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"see in it. Perhaps the love and beauty, however base their primal"
3153,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"incarnation, are really, as they think themselves, aspirations toward"
3154,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"the Most High. In the long studies and weary journeys of the artist,"
3155,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"in his mighty inspiration, in his intense love of the structural"
3156,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"beauty of the human body, in his vicissitudes of fortune and his"
3157,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"artistic disappointments, in his exalted piety, we may see quite enough"
3158,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,explanation for the burden of his soul. It is not necessary to find
3159,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,vulgar causes for the extraordinary feelings of an extraordinary man.
3160,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,It suffices that life wore this aspect to him; that the great demands
3161,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,of his spirit so expressed themselves in the presence of his world.
3162,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,Here is a madrigal in which the Platonic theory of beauty is clearly
3163,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,stated:--
3164,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3165,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"""For faithful guide unto my labouring heart"
3166,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Beauty was given me at birth,"
3167,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,To be my glass and lamp in either art.
3168,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Who thinketh otherwise misknows her worth,"
3169,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,For highest beauty only gives me light
3170,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,To carve and paint aright.
3171,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,Rash is the thought and vain
3172,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,That maketh beauty from the senses grow.
3173,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"She lifts to heaven hearts that truly know,"
3174,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,But eyes grown dim with pain
3175,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,From mortal to immortal cannot go
3176,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Nor without grace of God look up again."""
3177,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3178,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"And here is a sonnet, called by Mr. Symonds ""the heavenly birth of love"
3179,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"and beauty."" I borrow in part from his translation:--"
3180,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3181,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"""My love's life comes not from this heart of mine."
3182,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"The love wherewith I love thee hath no heart,"
3183,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,Turned thither whither no fell thoughts incline
3184,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,And erring human passion leaves no smart.
3185,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Love, from God's bosom when our souls did part,"
3186,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Made me pure eye to see, thee light to shine,"
3187,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"And I must needs, half mortal though thou art,"
3188,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,In spite of sorrow know thee all divine.
3189,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"As heat in fire, so must eternity"
3190,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,In beauty dwell; through thee my soul's endeavour.
3191,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,Mounts to the pattern and the source of thee;
3192,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"And having found all heaven in thine eyes,"
3193,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,Beneath thy brows my burning spirit flies
3194,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"There where I loved thee first to dwell for ever."""
3195,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3196,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,Something of this kind may also be found in the verses of Lorenzo de'
3197,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Medici, who, like Michael Angelo, was a poet only incidentally, and"
3198,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,even thought it necessary to apologize in a preface for having written
3199,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"about love. Many of his compositions are, indeed, trivial enough, but"
3200,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,his pipings will not seem vain to the severest philosopher when he
3201,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"finds them leading to strains like the following, where the thought"
3202,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,rises to the purest sphere of tragedy and of religion:--
3203,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3204,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"""As a lamp, burning through the waning night,"
3205,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,When the oil begins to fail that fed its fire
3206,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Flares up, and in its dying waxes bright"
3207,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"And mounts and spreads, the better to expire;"
3208,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,So in this pilgrimage and earthly flight
3209,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"The ancient hope is spent that fed desire,"
3210,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,And if there burn within a greater light
3211,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,'Tis that the vigil's end approacheth nigher.
3212,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Hence thy last insult, Fortune, cannot move,"
3213,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,Nor death's inverted torches give alarm;
3214,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,I see the end of wrath and bitter moan.
3215,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,My fair Medusa into sculptured stone
3216,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Turns me no more, my Siren cannot charm."
3217,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Heaven draws me up to its supernal love."""
3218,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3219,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,From such spontaneous meditation Lorenzo could even pass to verses
3220,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"officially religious; but in them too, beneath the threadbare metaphors"
3221,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"of the pious muse and her mystical paradoxes, we may still feel the"
3222,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"austerity and firmness of reason. The following stanzas, for instance,"
3223,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"taken from his ""Laudi Spirituali,"" assume a sublime meaning if we"
3224,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"remember that the essence to which they are addressed, before being a"
3225,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,celestial Monarch into whose visible presence any accident might usher
3226,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"us, was a general idea of what is good and an intransitive rational"
3227,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"energy, indistinguishable from the truth of things."
3228,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3229,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"""O let this wretched life within me die"
3230,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"That I may live in thee, my life indeed;"
3231,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"In thee alone, where dwells eternity,"
3232,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,While hungry multitudes death's hunger feed.
3233,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"I list within, and hark! Death's stealthy tread!"
3234,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"I look to thee, and nothing then is dead."
3235,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3236,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"""Then eyes may see a light invisible"
3237,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"And ears may hear a voice without a sound,--"
3238,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"A voice and light not harsh, but tempered well,"
3239,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Which the mind wakens when the sense is drowned,"
3240,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Till, wrapped within herself, the soul have flown"
3241,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,To that last good which is her inmost own.
3242,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3243,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"""When, sweet and beauteous Master, on that day,"
3244,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Reviewing all my loves with aching heart,"
3245,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"I take from each its bitter self away,"
3246,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"The remnant shall be thou, their better part."
3247,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,This perfect sweetness be his single store
3248,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,Who seeks the good; this faileth nevermore.
3249,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3250,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"""A thirst unquenchable is not beguiled"
3251,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,By draught on draught of any running river
3252,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Whose fiery waters feed our pangs for ever,"
3253,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,But by a living fountain undefiled.
3254,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"O sacred well, I seek thee and were fain"
3255,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"To drink; so should I never thirst again."""
3256,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3257,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Having before us these characteristic expressions of Platonic feeling,"
3258,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"as it arose again in a Christian age, divorced from the accidental"
3259,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"setting which Greek manners had given it, we may be better able to"
3260,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,understand its essence. It is nothing else than the application to
3261,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"passion of that pursuit of something permanent in a world of change,"
3262,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"of something absolute in a world of relativity, which was the essence"
3263,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,of the Platonic philosophy. If we may give rein to the imagination
3264,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,in a matter which without imagination could not be understood at
3265,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"all, we may fancy Plato trying to comprehend the power which beauty"
3266,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,exerted over his senses by applying to the objects of love that
3267,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,profound metaphysical distinction which he had learned to make in his
3268,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,dialectical studies--the distinction between the appearance to sense
3269,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"and the reality envisaged by the intellect, between the phenomenon"
3270,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,and the ideal. The whole natural world had come to seem to him like
3271,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,a world of dreams. In dreams images succeed one another without
3272,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,other meaning than that which they derive from our strange power
3273,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"of recognition--a power which enables us somehow, among the most"
3274,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"incongruous transformations and surroundings, to find again the objects"
3275,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"of our waking life, and to name those absurd and unmannerly visions by"
3276,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,the name of father or mother or by any other familiar name. As these
3277,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"resemblances to real things make up all the truth of our dream, and"
3278,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"these recognitions all its meaning, so Plato thought that all the truth"
3279,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,and meaning of earthly things was the reference they contained to a
3280,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,heavenly original. This heavenly original we remember and recognize
3281,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"even among the distortions, disappearances, and multiplications of its"
3282,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,earthly copies.
3283,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3284,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"This thought is easily applicable to the affections; indeed, it is not"
3285,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,impossible that it was the natural transcendence of any deep glance
3286,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"into beauty, and the lessons in disillusion and idealism given by that"
3287,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"natural metaphysician we call love, that first gave Plato the key to"
3288,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"his general system. There is, at any rate, no sphere in which the"
3289,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"supersensible is approached with so warm a feeling of its reality, in"
3290,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,which the phenomenon is so transparent and so indifferent a symbol of
3291,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"something perfect and divine beyond. In love and beauty, if anywhere,"
3292,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"even the common man thinks he has visitations from a better world,"
3293,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,approaches to a lost happiness; a happiness never tasted by us in
3294,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"this world, and yet so natural, so expected, that we look for it at"
3295,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"every turn of a corner, in every new face; we look for it with so much"
3296,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"confidence, with so much depth of expectation, that we never quite"
3297,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,overcome our disappointment that it is not found.
3298,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3299,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"And it is not found,--no, never,--in spite of what we may think when"
3300,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,we are first in love. Plato knew this well from his experience. He
3301,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"had had successful loves, or what the world calls such, but he could"
3302,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"not fancy that these successes were more than provocations, more"
3303,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,than hints of what the true good is. To have mistaken them for real
3304,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,happiness would have been to continue to dream. It would have shown
3305,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,as little comprehension of the heart's experience as the idiot shows
3306,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,of the experience of the senses when he is unable to put together
3307,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"impressions of his eyes and hands and to say, ""Here is a table; here"
3308,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"is a stool."" It is by a parallel use of the understanding that we put"
3309,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,together the impressions of the heart and the imagination and are
3310,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"able to say, ""Here is absolute beauty: here is God."" The impressions"
3311,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"themselves have no permanence, no intelligible essence. As Plato said,"
3312,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,they are never anything fixed but are always either becoming or ceasing
3313,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"to be what we think them. There must be, he tells us, an eternal and"
3314,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,clearly definable object of which the visible appearances to us are the
3315,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,manifold semblance; now by one trait now by another the phantom before
3316,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"us lights up that vague and haunting idea, and makes us utter its name"
3317,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,with a momentary sense of certitude and attainment.
3318,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3319,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,Just so the individual beauties that charm our attention and enchain
3320,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"the soul have only a transitive existence; they are momentary visions,"
3321,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,irrecoverable moods. Their object is unstable; we never can say what
3322,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"it is, it changes so quickly before our eyes. What is it that a mother"
3323,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"loves in her child? Perhaps the babe not yet born, or the babe that"
3324,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,grew long ago by her suffering and unrecognized care; perhaps the man
3325,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,to be or the youth that has been. What does a man love in a woman?
3326,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"The girl that is yet, perhaps, to be his, or the wife that once chose"
3327,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"to give him her whole existence. Where, among all these glimpses, is"
3328,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"the true object of love? It flies before us, it tempts us on, only"
3329,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,to escape and turn to mock us from a new quarter. And yet nothing
3330,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"can concern us more or be more real to us than this mysterious good,"
3331,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,since the pursuit of it gives our lives whatever they have of true
3332,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"earnestness and meaning, and the approach to it whatever they have of"
3333,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,joy.
3334,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3335,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"So far is this ideal, Plato would say, from being an illusion, that it"
3336,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"is the source of the world, the power that keeps us in existence. But"
3337,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"for it, we should be dead. A profound indifference, an initial torpor,"
3338,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"would have kept us from ever opening our eyes, and we should have no"
3339,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"world of business or pleasure, politics or science, to think about at"
3340,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"all. We, and the whole universe, exist only by the passionate attempt"
3341,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"to return to our perfection, by the radical need of losing ourselves"
3342,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,again in God. That ineffable good is our natural possession; all we
3343,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,honour in this life is but the partial recovery of our birthright;
3344,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,every delightful thing is like a rift in the clouds through which we
3345,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,catch a glimpse of our native heaven. If that heaven seems so far away
3346,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"and the idea of it so dim and unreal, it is because we are so far from"
3347,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"perfect, so much immersed in what is alien and destructive to the soul."
3348,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3349,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,Thus the history of our loves is the record of our divine
3350,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"conversations, of our intercourse with heaven. It matters very"
3351,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"little whether this history seems to us tragic or not. In one sense,"
3352,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,all mortal loves are tragic because never is the creature we think
3353,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,we possess the true and final object of our love; this love must
3354,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"ultimately pass beyond that particular apparition, which is itself"
3355,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,continually passing away and shifting all its lines and colours. As
3356,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Heraclitus could never bathe twice in the same river, because its water"
3357,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"had flowed away, so Plato could never look twice at the same face, for"
3358,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,it had become another. But on the other hand the most unsuccessful
3359,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"passion cannot be a vain thing. More, perhaps, than if it had found"
3360,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"an apparent satisfaction, it will reveal to us an object of infinite"
3361,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"worth, and the flight of the soul, detached by it from the illusions of"
3362,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"common life, will be more straight and steady toward the ultimate good."
3363,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3364,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Such, if we are not mistaken, is the lesson of Plato's experience"
3365,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,and also of that of the Italian poets whom we have quoted. Is this
3366,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,experience something normal? Is it the rational outcome of our own
3367,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,lives? That is a question which each man must answer for himself.
3368,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,Our immediate object will have been attained if we have made more
3369,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"intelligible a tendency which is certainly very common among men, and"
3370,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,not among the men least worthy of honour. It is the tendency to make
3371,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"our experience of love rational, as scientific thinking is a tendency"
3372,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,to make rational our experience of the outer world. The theories of
3373,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,natural science are creations of human reason; they change with the
3374,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"growth of reason, and express the intellectual impulses of each nation"
3375,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,and age. Theories about the highest good do the same; only being less
3376,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"applicable in practice, less controllable by experiment, they seldom"
3377,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,attain the same distinctness and articulation. But there is nothing
3378,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"authoritative in those constructions of the intellect, nothing coercive"
3379,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,except in so far as our own experience and reflection force us to
3380,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,accept them. Natural science is persuasive because it embodies the
3381,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,momentum of common sense and of the practical arts; it carries on
3382,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,their spontaneous processes by more refined but essentially similar
3383,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"methods. Moral science is persuasive under the same conditions, but"
3384,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,these conditions are not so generally found in the minds of men. Their
3385,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,conscience is often superstitious and perfunctory; their imagination is
3386,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,usually either disordered or dull. There is little momentum in their
3387,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,lives which the moralist can rely upon to carry them onward toward
3388,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,rational ideals. Deprived of this support his theories fall to the
3389,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"ground; they must seem, to every man whose nature cannot elicit them"
3390,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"from his own experience, empty verbiage and irrelevant dreams."
3391,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3392,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,Nothing in the world of fact obliges us to agree with Michael Angelo
3393,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,when he says that eternity can no more be separated from beauty than
3394,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"heat from fire. Beauty is a thing we experience, a value we feel;"
3395,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,but eternity is something problematical. It might well happen that
3396,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,beauty should exist for a while in our contemplation and that eternity
3397,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,should have nothing to do with it or with us. It might well happen
3398,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"that our affections, being the natural expression of our instincts in"
3399,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"the family and in the state, should bind us for a while to the beings"
3400,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"with whom life has associated us--a father, a lover, a child--and that"
3401,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"these affections should gradually fade with the decay of our vitality,"
3402,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"declining in the evening of life, and passing away when we surrender"
3403,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"our breath, without leading us to any single and supreme good, to any"
3404,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"eternal love. If, therefore, the thoughts and consolations we have"
3405,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"been rehearsing have sounded to us extravagant or unnatural, we cannot"
3406,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,justify them by attempting to prove the actual existence of their
3407,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"objects, by producing the absolute beauty or by showing where and how"
3408,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,we may come face to face with God. We may well feel that beauty and
3409,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,love are clear and good enough without any such additional embodiments.
3410,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"We may take the world as it is, without feigning another, and study"
3411,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,actual experience without postulating any that is hypothetical. We can
3412,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,welcome beauty for the pleasure it affords and love for the happiness
3413,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"it brings, without asking that these things should receive supernatural"
3414,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,extensions.
3415,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3416,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,But we should have studied Plato and his kindred poets to little
3417,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,purpose if we thought that by admitting all this we were rejecting more
3418,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,than the mythical element that was sometimes mixed with their ideal
3419,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,philosophy. Its essence is not touched by any acknowledgment of what
3420,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,seems true or probable in the realm of actual existence. Nothing is
3421,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,more characteristic of the Platonic mind than a complete indifference
3422,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,to the continuance of experience and an exclusive interest in its
3423,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,comprehension. If we wish to understand this classic attitude of
3424,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"reason, all we need do is to let reason herself instruct us. We do"
3425,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"not need more data, but more mind. If we take the sights and the loves"
3426,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"that our mortal limitations have allowed of, and surrender ourselves"
3427,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,unreservedly to their natural eloquence; if we say to the spirit that
3428,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"stirs within them, ""Be thou me, impetuous one""; if we become, as"
3429,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"Michael Angelo says he was, all eyes to see or all heart to feel, then"
3430,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"the force of our spiritual vitality, the momentum of our imagination,"
3431,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"will carry us beyond ourselves, beyond an interest in our personal"
3432,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"existence or eventual emotions, into the presence of a divine beauty"
3433,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"and an eternal truth--things impossible to realize in experience,"
3434,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,although necessarily envisaged by thought.
3435,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3436,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"As the senses that perceive, in the act of perceiving assert an"
3437,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"absolute reality in their object, as the mind that looks before and"
3438,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,after believes in the existence of a past and a future which cannot
3439,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"now be experienced, so the imagination and the heart behold, when they"
3440,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"are left free to expand and express themselves, an absolute beauty"
3441,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,and a perfect love. Intense contemplation disentangles the ideal from
3442,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"the idol of sense, and a purified will rests in it as in the true"
3443,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"object of worship. These are the oracles of reason, the prophecies of"
3444,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,those profounder spirits who in the world of Nature are obedient unto
3445,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,death because they belong intrinsically to a world where death is
3446,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"impossible, and who can rise continually, by abstraction from personal"
3447,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"sensibility, into identity with the eternal objects of rational life."
3448,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,
3449,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,Such a religion must elude popular apprehension until it is translated
3450,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,into myths and cosmological dogmas. It is easier for men to fill out
3451,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,the life of the spirit by supplementing the facts of experience by
3452,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,other facts for which there is no evidence than it is for them to
3453,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,master the given facts and turn them to spiritual uses. Many can fight
3454,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,for a doubtful fact when they cannot perform a difficult idealization.
3455,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"They trust, as all men must, to what they can see; they believe in"
3456,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"things as their faculties represent things to them. By the same right,"
3457,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"however, the rationalizer of experience believes in his visions; he"
3458,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"rests, like the meanest of us, in the present object of his thought."
3459,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"So long as we live at all we must trust in something, at least in the"
3460,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,coherence and permanence of the visible world and in the value of the
3461,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"objects of our own desires. And if we live nobly, we are under the same"
3462,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"necessity of believing in noble things. However unreal, therefore,"
3463,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,these Platonic intuitions may seem to those of us whose interests lie
3464,PLATONIC LOVE IN SOME ITALIAN POETS,"in other quarters, we may rest assured that these very thoughts would"

3477,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3478,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,We are accustomed to think of the universality of Shakespeare as not
3479,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,the least of his glories. No other poet has given so many-sided an
3480,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"expression to human nature, or rendered so many passions and moods"
3481,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"with such an appropriate variety of style, sentiment, and accent. If,"
3482,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"therefore, we were asked to select one monument of human civilization"
3483,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"that should survive to some future age, or be transported to another"
3484,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,planet to bear witness to the inhabitants there of what we have been
3485,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"upon earth, we should probably choose the works of Shakespeare. In them"
3486,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,we recognize the truest portrait and best memorial of man. Yet the
3487,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"archæologists of that future age, or the cosmographers of that other"
3488,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"part of the heavens, after conscientious study of our Shakespearian"
3489,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"autobiography, would misconceive our life in one important respect."
3490,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,They would hardly understand that man had had a religion.
3491,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3492,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"There are, indeed, numerous exclamations and invocations in"
3493,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Shakespeare which we, who have other means of information, know to"
3494,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"be evidences of current religious ideas. Shakespeare adopts these,"
3495,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"as he adopts the rest of his vocabulary, from the society about"
3496,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,him. But he seldom or never gives them their original value. When
3497,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Iago says ""'_sblood_"" a commentator might add explanations which"
3498,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,should involve the whole philosophy of Christian devotion; but this
3499,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Christian sentiment is not in Iago's mind, nor in Shakespeare's, any"
3500,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,more than the virtues of Heracles and his twelve labours are in the
3501,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"mind of every slave and pander that cries ""_hercule""_ in the pages of"
3502,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,Plautus and Terence. Oaths are the fossils of piety. The geologist
3503,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"recognizes in them the relics of a once active devotion, but they are"
3504,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,now only counters and pebbles tossed about in the unconscious play of
3505,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"expression. The lighter and more constant their use, the less their"
3506,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,meaning.
3507,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3508,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,Only one degree more inward than this survival of a religious
3509,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,vocabulary in profane speech is the reference we often find in
3510,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Shakespeare to religious institutions and traditions. There are monks,"
3511,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"bishops, and cardinals; there is even mention of saints, although"
3512,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"none is ever presented to us in person. The clergy, if they have any"
3513,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"wisdom, have an earthly one. Friar Lawrence culls his herbs like a"
3514,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,more benevolent Medea; and Cardinal Wolsey flings away ambition with
3515,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,a profoundly Pagan despair; his robe and his integrity to heaven are
3516,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"cold comfort to him. Juliet goes to shrift to arrange her love affairs,"
3517,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,and Ophelia should go to a nunnery to forget hers. Even the chastity
3518,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,of Isabella has little in it that would have been out of place in
3519,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Iphigenia. The metaphysical Hamlet himself sees a ""true ghost,"" but so"
3520,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,far reverts to the positivism that underlies Shakespeare's thinking as
3521,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"to speak soon after of that ""undiscovered country from whose bourn no"
3522,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"traveller returns."" There are only two or three short passages in the"
3523,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"plays, and one sonnet, in which true religious feeling seems to break"
3524,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"forth. The most beautiful of these passages is that in ""Richard II,"""
3525,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"which commemorates the death of Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk--"
3526,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3527,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"""Many a time hath banished Norfolk fought"
3528,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,"
3529,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
3530,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Against black Pagans, Turks, and Saracens;"
3531,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"And, toiled with works of war, retired himself"
3532,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"To Italy; and there, at Venice, gave"
3533,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"His body to that pleasant country's earth,"
3534,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,"
3535,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Under whose colours he had fought so long."""
3536,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3537,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"This is tender and noble, and full of an indescribable chivalry and"
3538,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"pathos, yet even here we find the spirit of war rather than that of"
3539,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"religion, and a deeper sense of Italy than of heaven. More unmixed is"
3540,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,the piety of Henry V after the battle of Agincourt:--
3541,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3542,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"""O God, thy arm was here;"
3543,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"And not to us, but to thy arm alone,"
3544,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Ascribe we all!--When, without stratagem,"
3545,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"But in plain shock and even play of battle,"
3546,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Was ever known so great and little loss,"
3547,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"On one part and on the other?--Take it, God,"
3548,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,For it is none but thine....
3549,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Come, go we in procession to the village,"
3550,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"And be it death proclaimed through our host,"
3551,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"To boast of this, or take that praise from God,"
3552,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,Which is his only....
3553,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,Do we all holy rites;
3554,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Let there be sung _Non nobis_ and _Te Deum_."""
3555,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3556,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"This passage is certainly a true expression of religious feeling, and"
3557,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,just the kind that we might expect from a dramatist. Religion appears
3558,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,here as a manifestation of human nature and as an expression of human
3559,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"passion. The passion, however, is not due to Shakespeare's imagination,"
3560,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"but is essentially historical: the poet has simply not rejected, as he"
3561,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"usually does, the religious element in the situation he reproduces.[1]"
3562,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3563,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"With this dramatic representation of piety we may couple another, of a"
3564,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"more intimate kind, from the Sonnets:--"
3565,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3566,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"""Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,"
3567,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Fooled by these rebel powers that thee array,"
3568,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,"
3569,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
3570,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Why so large cost, having so short a lease,"
3571,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
3572,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,"
3573,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end?
3574,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Then, soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,"
3575,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
3576,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Buy terms divine by selling hours of dross,"
3577,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Within be fed, without be rich no more:"
3578,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Then shalt thou feed on death, that feeds on men,"
3579,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"And death once dead, there's no more dying then."""
3580,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3581,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,This sonnet contains more than a natural religious emotion inspired by
3582,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"a single event. It contains reflection, and expresses a feeling not"
3583,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,merely dramatically proper but rationally just. A mind that habitually
3584,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,ran into such thoughts would be philosophically pious; it would be
3585,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"spiritual. The Sonnets, as a whole, are spiritual; their passion is"
3586,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"transmuted into discipline. Their love, which, whatever its nominal"
3587,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"object, is hardly anything but love of beauty and youth in general,"
3588,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,is made to triumph over time by a metaphysical transformation of the
3589,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,object into something eternal. At first this is the beauty of the race
3590,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"renewing itself by generation, then it is the description of beauty in"
3591,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"the poet's verse, and finally it is the immortal soul enriched by the"
3592,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,contemplation of that beauty. This noble theme is the more impressively
3593,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"rendered by being contrasted with another, with a vulgar love that by"
3594,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"its nature refuses to be so transformed and transmuted. ""Two loves,"""
3595,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"cries the poet, in a line that gives us the essence of the whole, ""Two"
3596,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"loves I have,--of comfort, and despair."""
3597,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3598,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"In all this depth of experience, however, there is still wanting any"
3599,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"religious image. The Sonnets are spiritual, but, with the doubtful"
3600,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"exception of the one quoted above, they are not Christian. And, of"
3601,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"course, a poet of Shakespeare's time could not have found any other"
3602,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"mould than Christianity for his religion. In our day, with our wide and"
3603,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"conscientious historical sympathies, it may be possible for us to find"
3604,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,in other rites and doctrines than those of our ancestors an expression
3605,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"of some ultimate truth. But for Shakespeare, in the matter of religion,"
3606,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,the choice lay between Christianity and nothing. He chose nothing; he
3607,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,chose to leave his heroes and himself in the presence of life and of
3608,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,death with no other philosophy than that which the profane world can
3609,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,suggest and understand.
3610,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3611,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"This positivism, we need hardly say, was not due to any grossness or"
3612,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,sluggishness in his imagination. Shakespeare could be idealistic when
3613,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"he dreamed, as he could be spiritual when he reflected. The spectacle"
3614,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,of life did not pass before his eyes as a mere phantasmagoria. He
3615,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,seized upon its principles; he became wise. Nothing can exceed
3616,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"the ripeness of his seasoned judgment, or the occasional breadth,"
3617,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"sadness, and terseness of his reflection. The author of ""Hamlet"""
3618,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"could not be without metaphysical aptitude; ""Macbeth"" could not"
3619,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"have been written without a sort of sibylline inspiration, or the"
3620,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,Sonnets without something of the Platonic mind. It is all the more
3621,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"remarkable, therefore, that we should have to search through all the"
3622,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,works of Shakespeare to find half a dozen passages that have so much
3623,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"as a religious sound, and that even these passages, upon examination,"
3624,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,should prove not to be the expression of any deep religious conception.
3625,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"If Shakespeare had been without metaphysical capacity, or without"
3626,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"moral maturity, we could have explained his strange insensibility to"
3627,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"religion; but as it is, we must marvel at his indifference and ask"
3628,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"ourselves what can be the causes of it. For, even if we should not"
3629,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"regard the absence of religion as an imperfection in his own thought,"
3630,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,we must admit it to be an incompleteness in his portrayal of the
3631,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"thought of others. Positivism may be a virtue in a philosopher, but it"
3632,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"is a vice in a dramatist, who has to render those human passions to"
3633,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,which the religious imagination has always given a larger meaning and
3634,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,a richer depth.
3635,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3636,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,Those greatest poets by whose side we are accustomed to put Shakespeare
3637,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,did not forego this advantage. They gave us man with his piety and
3638,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,the world with its gods. Homer is the chief repository of the Greek
3639,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"religion, and Dante the faithful interpreter of the Catholic. Nature"
3640,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"would have been inconceivable to them without the supernatural, or man"
3641,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,without the influence and companionship of the gods. These poets live
3642,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"in a cosmos. In their minds, as in the mind of their age, the fragments"
3643,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"of experience have fallen together into a perfect picture, like the"
3644,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,bits of glass in a kaleidoscope. Their universe is a total. Reason
3645,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,and imagination have mastered it completely and peopled it. No chaos
3646,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"remains beyond, or, if it does, it is thought of with an involuntary"
3647,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,shudder that soon passes into a healthy indifference. They have a
3648,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"theory of human life; they see man in his relations, surrounded by a"
3649,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,kindred universe in which he fills his allotted place. He knows the
3650,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"meaning and issue of his life, and does not voyage without a chart."
3651,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3652,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Shakespeare's world, on the contrary, is only the world of human"
3653,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,society. The cosmos eludes him; he does not seem to feel the need
3654,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,of framing that idea. He depicts human life in all its richness and
3655,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"variety, but leaves that life without a setting, and consequently"
3656,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,without a meaning. If we asked him to tell us what is the significance
3657,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"of the passion and beauty he had so vividly displayed, and what is the"
3658,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"outcome of it all, he could hardly answer in any other words than those"
3659,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,he puts into the mouth of Macbeth:--
3660,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3661,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"""To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,"
3662,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,"
3663,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,To the last syllable of recorded time;
3664,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
3665,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!"
3666,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player"
3667,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
3668,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,And then is heard no more: it is a tale
3669,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,"
3670,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Signifying nothing."""
3671,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3672,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,How differently would Homer or Dante have answered that question!
3673,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,Their tragedy would have been illumined by a sense of the divinity
3674,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"of life and beauty, or by a sense of the sanctity of suffering and"
3675,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,death. Their faith had enveloped the world of experience in a world
3676,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"of imagination, in which the ideals of the reason, of the fancy, and"
3677,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,of the heart had a natural expression. They had caught in the reality
3678,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"the hint of a lovelier fable,--a fable in which that reality was"
3679,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"completed and idealized, and made at once vaster in its extent and more"
3680,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"intelligible in its principle. They had, as it were, dramatized the"
3681,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"universe, and endowed it with the tragic unities. In contrast with such"
3682,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"a luminous philosophy and so well-digested an experience, the silence"
3683,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,of Shakespeare and his philosophical incoherence have something in
3684,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,them that is still heathen; something that makes us wonder whether the
3685,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"northern mind, even in him, did not remain morose and barbarous at its"
3686,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,inmost core.
3687,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3688,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"But before we allow ourselves such hasty and general inferences, we"
3689,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,may well stop to consider whether there is not some simpler answer to
3690,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"our question. An epic poet, we might say, naturally deals with cosmic"
3691,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,themes. He needs supernatural machinery because he depicts the movement
3692,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"of human affairs in their generality, as typified in the figures of"
3693,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,heroes whose function it is to embody or to overcome elemental forces.
3694,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Such a poet's world is fabulous, because his inspiration is impersonal."
3695,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,But the dramatist renders the concrete reality of life. He has no
3696,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,need of a superhuman setting for his pictures. Such a setting would
3697,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,destroy the vitality of his creations. His plots should involve only
3698,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,human actors and human motives: the _deus ex machina_ has always been
3699,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,regarded as an inter-loper on his stage. The passions of man are his
3700,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,all-sufficient material; he should weave his whole fabric out of them.
3701,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3702,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"To admit the truth of all this would not, however, solve our problem."
3703,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,The dramatist cannot be expected to put cosmogonies on the boards.
3704,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,Miracle-plays become dramatic only when they become human. But the
3705,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"supernatural world, which the playwright does not bring before the"
3706,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"foot-lights, may exist nevertheless in the minds of his characters"
3707,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"and of his audience. He may refer to it, appeal to it, and imply it,"
3708,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,in the actions and in the sentiments he attributes to his heroes. And
3709,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,if the comparison of Shakespeare with Homer or Dante on the score of
3710,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,religious inspiration is invalidated by the fact that he is a dramatist
3711,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"while they are epic poets, a comparison may yet be instituted between"
3712,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Shakespeare and other dramatists, from which his singular insensibility"
3713,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,to religion will as readily appear.
3714,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3715,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Greek tragedy, as we know, is dominated by the idea of fate. Even when"
3716,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"the gods do not appear in person, or where the service or neglect"
3717,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"of them is not the moving cause of the whole play,--as it is in the"
3718,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"""Bacchæ"" and the ""Hippolytus"" of Euripides,--still the deep conviction"
3719,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,of the limits and conditions of human happiness underlies the fable.
3720,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,The will of man fulfils the decrees of Heaven. The hero manifests a
3721,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"higher force than his own, both in success and in failure. The fates"
3722,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,guide the willing and drag the unwilling. There is no such fragmentary
3723,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"view of life as we have in our romantic drama, where accidents make the"
3724,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,meaningless happiness or unhappiness of a supersensitive adventurer.
3725,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Life is seen whole, although in miniature. Its boundaries and its"
3726,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"principles are studied more than its incidents. The human, therefore,"
3727,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"everywhere merges with the divine. Our mortality, being sharply defined"
3728,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"and much insisted upon, draws the attention all the more to that"
3729,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,eternity of Nature and of law in which it is embosomed. Nor is the
3730,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,fact of superhuman control left for our reflection to discover; it is
3731,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,emphatically asserted in those oracles on which so much of the action
3732,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,commonly turns.
3733,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3734,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"When the Greek religion was eclipsed by the Christian, the ancient way"
3735,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,of conceiving the ultra-human relations of human life became obsolete.
3736,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,It was no longer possible to speak with sincerity of the oracles and
3737,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"gods, of Nemesis and [Greek: hubris]. Yet for a long time it was not"
3738,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,possible to speak in any other terms. The new ideas were without
3739,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"artistic definition, and literature was paralyzed. But in the course"
3740,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"of ages, when the imagination had had time and opportunity to develop"
3741,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"a Christian art and a Christian philosophy, the dramatic poets were"
3742,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,ready to deal with the new themes. Only their readiness in this respect
3743,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"surpassed their ability, at least their ability to please those who had"
3744,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,any memory of the ancient perfection of the arts.
3745,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3746,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,The miracle-plays were the beginning. Their crudity was extreme and
3747,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"their levity of the frankest; but they had still, like the Greek plays,"
3748,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,a religious excuse and a religious background. They were not without
3749,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"dramatic power, but their offences against taste and their demands upon"
3750,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,faith were too great for them to survive the Renaissance. Such plays as
3751,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"the ""Polyeucte"" of Corneille and the ""Devocion de la Cruz"" of Calderon,"
3752,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"with other Spanish plays that might be mentioned, are examples of"
3753,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,Christian dramas by poets of culture; but as a whole we must say that
3754,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Christianity, while it succeeded in expressing itself in painting"
3755,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"and in architecture, failed to express itself in any adequate drama."
3756,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Where Christianity was strong, the drama either disappeared or became"
3757,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"secular; and it has never again dealt with cosmic themes successfully,"
3758,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"except in such hands as those of Goethe and Wagner, men who either"
3759,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,neglected Christianity altogether or used it only as an incidental
3760,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"ornament, having, as they say, transcended it in their philosophy."
3761,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3762,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"The fact is, that art and reflection have never been able to unite"
3763,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"perfectly the two elements of a civilization like ours, that draws its"
3764,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,culture from one source and its religion from another. Modern taste has
3765,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"ever been, and still is, largely exotic, largely a revolution in favour"
3766,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"of something ancient or foreign. The more cultivated a period has been,"
3767,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,the more wholly it has reverted to antiquity for its inspiration. The
3768,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,existence of that completer world has haunted all minds struggling for
3769,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"self-expression, and interfered, perhaps, with the natural development"
3770,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,of their genius. The old art which they could not disregard distracted
3771,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"them from the new ideal, and prevented them from embodying this ideal"
3772,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"outwardly; while the same ideal, retaining their inward allegiance,"
3773,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,made their revivals of ancient forms artificial and incomplete. The
3774,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,strange idea could thus gain admittance that art was not called to deal
3775,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,with everything; that its sphere was the world of polite conventions.
3776,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,The serious and the sacred things of life were to be left unexpressed
3777,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,and inarticulate; while the arts masqueraded in the forms of a Pagan
3778,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"antiquity, to which a triviality was at the same time attributed which"
3779,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,in fact it had not possessed. This unfortunate separation of experience
3780,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,and its artistic expression betrayed itself in the inadequacy of what
3781,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,was beautiful and the barbarism of what was sincere.
3782,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3783,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"When such are the usual conditions of artistic creation, we need"
3784,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"not wonder that Shakespeare, a poet of the Renaissance, should have"
3785,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"confined his representation of life to its secular aspects, and that"
3786,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,his readers after him should rather have marvelled at the variety of
3787,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,the things of which he showed an understanding than have taken note of
3788,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,the one thing he overlooked. To omit religion was after all to omit
3789,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,what was not felt to be congenial to a poet's mind. The poet was to
3790,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,trace for us the passionate and romantic embroideries of life; he was
3791,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"to be artful and humane, and above all he was to be delightful. The"
3792,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,beauty and charm of things had nothing any longer to do with those
3793,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,painful mysteries and contentions which made the temper of the pious
3794,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"so acrid and sad. In Shakespeare's time and country, to be religious"
3795,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,already began to mean to be Puritanical; and in the divorce between the
3796,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,fulness of life on the one hand and the depth and unity of faith on
3797,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"the other, there could be no doubt to which side a man of imaginative"
3798,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,instincts would attach himself. A world of passion and beauty without
3799,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,a meaning must seem to him more interesting and worthy than a world of
3800,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"empty principle and dogma, meagre, fanatical, and false. It was beyond"
3801,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,the power of synthesis possessed by that age and nation to find a
3802,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,principle of all passion and a religion of all life.
3803,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3804,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,This power of synthesis is indeed so difficult and rare that the
3805,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"attempt to gain it is sometimes condemned as too philosophical, and"
3806,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,as tending to embarrass the critical eye and creative imagination
3807,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"with futile theories. We might say, for instance, that the absence of"
3808,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,religion in Shakespeare was a sign of his good sense; that a healthy
3809,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,instinct kept his attention within the sublunary world; and that he
3810,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"was in that respect superior to Homer and to Dante. For, while they"
3811,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"allowed their wisdom to clothe itself in fanciful forms, he gave us his"
3812,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"in its immediate truth, so that he embodied what they signified. The"
3813,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"supernatural machinery of their poems was, we might say, an accidental"
3814,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"incumbrance, a traditional means of expression, which they only half"
3815,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"understood, and which made their representation of life indirect and"
3816,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"partly unreal. Shakespeare, on the other hand, had reached his poetical"
3817,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,majority and independence. He rendered human experience no longer
3818,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"through symbols, but by direct imaginative representation. What I have"
3819,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"treated as a limitation in him would, then, appear as the maturity of"
3820,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,his strength.
3821,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3822,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,There is always a class of minds in whom the spectacle of history
3823,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,produces a certain apathy of reason. They flatter themselves that they
3824,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,can escape defeat by not attempting the highest tasks. We need not
3825,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,here stop to discuss what value as truth a philosophical synthesis may
3826,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"hope to attain, nor have we to protest against the æsthetic preference"
3827,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,for the sketch and the episode over a reasoned and unified rendering
3828,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"of life. Suffice it to say that the human race hitherto, whenever it"
3829,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"has reached a phase of comparatively high development and freedom,"
3830,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"has formed a conception of its place in Nature, no less than of the"
3831,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,contents of its life; and that this conception has been the occasion
3832,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"of religious sentiments and practices; and further, that every art,"
3833,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"whether literary or plastic, has drawn its favourite themes from this"
3834,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,religious sphere. The poetic imagination has not commonly stopped
3835,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,short of the philosophical in representing a superhuman environment of
3836,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,man.
3837,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3838,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Shakespeare, however, is remarkable among the greater poets for being"
3839,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,without a philosophy and without a religion. In his drama there is
3840,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"no fixed conception of any forces, natural or moral, dominating and"
3841,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,transcending our mortal energies. Whether this characteristic be
3842,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"regarded as a merit or as a defect, its presence cannot be denied."
3843,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,Those who think it wise or possible to refrain from searching for
3844,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"general principles, and are satisfied with the successive empirical"
3845,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"appearance of things, without any faith in their rational continuity or"
3846,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"completeness, may well see in Shakespeare their natural prophet. For"
3847,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"he, too, has been satisfied with the successive description of various"
3848,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"passions and events. His world, like the earth before Columbus, extends"
3849,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,in an indefinite plane which he is not tempted to explore.
3850,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3851,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"Those of us, however, who believe in circumnavigation, and who think"
3852,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,that both human reason and human imagination require a certain totality
3853,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"in our views, and who feel that the most important thing in life is the"
3854,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"lesson of it, and its relation to its own ideal,--we can hardly find"
3855,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,in Shakespeare all that the highest poet could give. Fulness is not
3856,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"necessarily wholeness, and the most profuse wealth of characterization"
3857,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"seems still inadequate as a picture of experience, if this picture is"
3858,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"not somehow seen from above and reduced to a dramatic unity,--to that"
3859,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,unity of meaning that can suffuse its endless details with something of
3860,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"dignity, simplicity, and peace. This is the imaginative power found in"
3861,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"several poets we have mentioned,--the power that gives certain passages"
3862,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"in Lucretius also their sublimity, as it gives sublimity to many"
3863,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,passages in the Bible.
3864,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,
3865,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,For what is required for theoretic wholeness is not this or that
3866,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"system but some system. Its value is not the value of truth, but that"
3867,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,of victorious imagination. Unity of conception is an æsthetic merit
3868,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,no less than a logical demand. A fine sense of the dignity and pathos
3869,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,of life cannot be attained unless we conceive somehow its outcome
3870,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,and its relations. Without such a conception our emotions cannot be
3871,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,steadfast and enlightened. Without it the imagination cannot fulfil
3872,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,its essential function or achieve its supreme success. Shakespeare
3873,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"himself, had it not been for the time and place in which he lived, when"
3874,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"religion and imagination blocked rather than helped each other, would"
3875,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,perhaps have allowed more of a cosmic background to appear behind his
3876,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"crowded scenes. If the Christian in him was not the real man, at least"
3877,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"the Pagan would have spoken frankly. The material forces of Nature,"
3878,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"or their vague embodiment in some northern pantheon, would then have"
3879,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,stood behind his heroes. The various movements of events would have
3880,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,appeared as incidents in a larger drama to which they had at least
3881,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"some symbolic relation. We should have been awed as well as saddened,"
3882,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"and purified as well as pleased, by being made to feel the dependence"
3883,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,of human accidents upon cosmic forces and their fated evolution. Then
3884,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,we should not have been able to say that Shakespeare was without a
3885,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,"religion. For the effort of religion, says Goethe, is to adjust us to"
3886,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,the inevitable; each religion in its way strives to bring about this
3887,THE ABSENCE OF RELIGION IN SHAKESPEARE,consummation.

3910,I,
3911,I,"It is an observation at first sight melancholy but in the end, perhaps,"
3912,I,"enlightening, that the earliest poets are the most ideal, and that"
3913,I,primitive ages furnish the most heroic characters and have the clearest
3914,I,vision of a perfect life. The Homeric times must have been full of
3915,I,"ignorance and suffering. In those little barbaric towns, in those camps"
3916,I,"and farms, in those shipyards, there must have been much insecurity"
3917,I,and superstition. That age was singularly poor in all that concerns
3918,I,the convenience of life and the entertainment of the mind with arts
3919,I,and sciences. Yet it had a sense for civilization. That machinery of
3920,I,life which men were beginning to devise appealed to them as poetical;
3921,I,they knew its ultimate justification and studied its incipient
3922,I,"processes with delight. The poetry of that simple and ignorant age was,"
3923,I,"accordingly, the sweetest and sanest that the world has known; the"
3924,I,"most faultless in taste, and the most even and lofty in inspiration."
3925,I,"Without lacking variety and homeliness, it bathed all things human in"
3926,I,"the golden light of morning; it clothed sorrow in a kind of majesty,"
3927,I,instinct with both self-control and heroic frankness. Nowhere else can
3928,I,"we find so noble a rendering of human nature, so spontaneous a delight"
3929,I,"in life, so uncompromising a dedication to beauty, and such a gift of"
3930,I,"seeing beauty in everything. Homer, the first of poets, was also the"
3931,I,best and the most poetical.
3932,I,
3933,I,"From this beginning, if we look down the history of Occidental"
3934,I,"literature, we see the power of idealization steadily decline. For"
3935,I,"while it finds here and there, as in Dante, a more spiritual theme"
3936,I,"and a subtler and riper intellect, it pays for that advantage by a"
3937,I,"more than equivalent loss in breadth, sanity, and happy vigour. And if"
3938,I,"ever imagination bursts out with a greater potency, as in Shakespeare"
3939,I,(who excels the patriarch of poetry in depth of passion and vividness
3940,I,"of characterization, and in those exquisite bubblings of poetry and"
3941,I,"humour in which English genius is at its best), yet Shakespeare also"
3942,I,"pays the price by a notable loss in taste, in sustained inspiration,"
3943,I,"in consecration, and in rationality. There is more or less rubbish in"
3944,I,his greatest works. When we come down to our own day _we_ find poets of
3945,I,hardly less natural endowment (for in endowment all ages are perhaps
3946,I,alike) and with vastly richer sources of inspiration; for they have
3947,I,"many arts and literatures behind them, with the spectacle of a varied"
3948,I,"and agitated society, a world which is the living microcosm of its own"
3949,I,"history and presents in one picture many races, arts, and religions."
3950,I,Our poets have more wonderful tragedies of the imagination to depict
3951,I,"than had Homer, whose world was innocent of any essential defeat,"
3952,I,"or Dante, who believed in the world's definitive redemption. Or, if"
3953,I,"perhaps their inspiration is comic, they have the pageant of mediæval"
3954,I,"manners, with its picturesque artifices and passionate fancies, and the"
3955,I,"long comedy of modern social revolutions, so illusory in their aims and"
3956,I,"so productive in their aimlessness. They have, moreover, the new and"
3957,I,marvellous conception which natural science has given us of the world
3958,I,and of the conditions of human progress.
3959,I,
3960,I,"With all these lessons of experience behind them, however, we find"
3961,I,"our contemporary poets incapable of any high wisdom, incapable of any"
3962,I,imaginative rendering of human life and its meaning. Our poets are
3963,I,"things of shreds and patches; they give us episodes and studies, a"
3964,I,"sketch of this curiosity, a glimpse of that romance; they have no total"
3965,I,"vision, no grasp of the whole reality, and consequently no capacity for"
3966,I,a sane and steady idealization. The comparatively barbarous ages had a
3967,I,"poetry of the ideal; they had visions of beauty, order, and perfection."
3968,I,This age of material elaboration has no sense for those things. Its
3969,I,"fancy is retrospective, whimsical, and flickering; its ideals, when"
3970,I,"it has any, are negative and partial; its moral strength is a blind"
3971,I,"and miscellaneous vehemence. Its poetry, in a word, is the poetry of"
3972,I,barbarism.
3973,I,
3974,I,This poetry should be viewed in relation to the general moral crisis
3975,I,and imaginative disintegration of which it gives a verbal echo; then
3976,I,"we shall avoid the injustice of passing it over as insignificant, no"
3977,I,less than the imbecility of hailing it as essentially glorious and
3978,I,successful. We must remember that the imagination of our race has been
3979,I,subject to a double discipline. It has been formed partly in the school
3980,I,"of classic literature and polity, and partly in the school of Christian"
3981,I,"piety. This duality of inspiration, this contradiction between the two"
3982,I,"accepted methods of rationalizing the world, has been a chief source"
3983,I,"of that incoherence, that romantic indistinctness and imperfection,"
3984,I,which largely characterize the products of the modern arts. A main
3985,I,cannot serve two masters; yet the conditions have not been such as to
3986,I,allow him wholly to despise the one or wholly to obey the other. To be
3987,I,wholly Pagan is impossible after the dissolution of that civilization
3988,I,"which had seemed universal, and that empire which had believed itself"
3989,I,"eternal. To be wholly Christian is impossible for a similar reason, now"
3990,I,"that the illusion and cohesion of Christian ages is lost, and for the"
3991,I,further reason that Christianity was itself fundamentally eclectic.
3992,I,"Before it could succeed and dominate men even for a time, it was"
3993,I,"obliged to adjust itself to reality, to incorporate many elements of"
3994,I,"Pagan wisdom, and to accommodate itself to many habits and passions at"
3995,I,variance with its own ideal.
3996,I,
3997,I,"In these latter times, with the prodigious growth of material life in"
3998,I,"elaboration and of mental life in diffusion, there has supervened upon"
3999,I,"this old dualism a new faith in man's absolute power, a kind of return"
4000,I,to the inexperience and self-assurance of youth. This new inspiration
4001,I,has made many minds indifferent to the two traditional disciplines 5
4002,I,"neither is seriously accepted by them, for the reason, excellent from"
4003,I,"their own point of view, that no discipline whatever is needed. The"
4004,I,memory of ancient disillusions has faded with time. Ignorance of the
4005,I,past has bred contempt for the lessons which the past might teach. Men
4006,I,prefer to repeat the old experiment without knowing that they repeat it.
4007,I,
4008,I,"I say advisedly ignorance of the past, in spite of the unprecedented"
4009,I,historical erudition of our time for life is an art not to be learned
4010,I,"by observation, and the most minute and comprehensive studies do not"
4011,I,teach us what the spirit of man should have learned by its long living.
4012,I,"We study the past as a dead object, as a ruin, not as an authority"
4013,I,and as an experiment. One reason why history was less interesting
4014,I,to former ages was that they were less conscious of separation
4015,I,from the past. The perspective of time was less clear because the
4016,I,synthesis of experience was more complete. The mind does not easily
4017,I,discriminate the successive phases of an action in which it is still
4018,I,engaged; it does not arrange in a temporal series the elements of a
4019,I,"single perception, but posits them all together as constituting a"
4020,I,permanent and real object. Human nature and the life of the world
4021,I,were real and stable objects to the apprehension of our fore-fathers
4022,I,"; the actors changed, but not the characters or the play. Men were"
4023,I,then less studious of derivations because they were more conscious of
4024,I,"identities. They thought of all reality as in a sense contemporary,"
4025,I,"and in considering the maxims of a philosopher or the style of a poet,"
4026,I,they were not primarily concerned with settling his date and describing
4027,I,his environment. The standard by which they judged was eternal; the
4028,I,environment in which man found himself did not seem to them subject of
4029,I,any essential change.
4030,I,
4031,I,To us the picturesque element in history is more striking because we
4032,I,"feel ourselves the children of our own age only, an age which being"
4033,I,"itself singular and revolutionary, tends to read its own character into"
4034,I,"the past, and to regard all other periods as no less fragmentary and"
4035,I,"effervescent than itself. The changing and the permanent elements are,"
4036,I,"indeed, everywhere present, and the bias of the observer may emphasize"
4037,I,the one or the other as it will: the only question is whether we find
4038,I,the significance of things in their variations or in their similarities.
4039,I,
4040,I,Now the habit of regarding the past as effete and as merely a
4041,I,"stepping-stone to something present or future, is unfavourable to any"
4042,I,true apprehension of that element in the past which was vital and which
4043,I,remains eternal. It is a habit of thought that destroys the sense of
4044,I,"the moral identity of all ages, by virtue of its very insistence on the"
4045,I,mechanical derivation of one age from another. Existences that cause
4046,I,one another exclude one another; each is alien to the rest inasmuch as
4047,I,it is the product of new and different conditions. Ideas that cause
4048,I,nothing unite all things by giving them a common point of reference and
4049,I,a single standard of value.
4050,I,
4051,I,"The classic and the Christian systems were both systems of ideas,"
4052,I,attempts to seize the eternal morphology of reality and describe
4053,I,its unchanging constitution. The imagination was summoned thereby
4054,I,"to contemplate the highest objects, and the essence of things"
4055,I,"being thus described, their insignificant variations could retain"
4056,I,little importance and the study of these variations might well seem
4057,I,"superficial. Mechanical science, the science of causes, was accordingly"
4058,I,"neglected, while the science of values, with the arts that express"
4059,I,"these values, was exclusively pursued. The reverse has now occurred"
4060,I,"and the spirit of life, innocent of any rationalizing discipline"
4061,I,"and deprived of an authoritative and adequate method of expression,"
4062,I,has relapsed into miscellaneous and shallow exuberance. Religion
4063,I,and art have become short-winded. They have forgotten the old maxim
4064,I,that we should copy in order to be copied and remember in order to
4065,I,be remembered. It is true that the multiplicity of these incompetent
4066,I,"efforts seems to many a compensation for their ill success, or even a"
4067,I,"ground for asserting their absolute superiority. Incompetence, when"
4068,I,"it flatters the passions, can always find a greater incompetence to"
4069,I,"approve of it. Indeed, some people would have regarded the Tower of"
4070,I,Babel as the best academy of eloquence on account of the variety of
4071,I,oratorical methods prevailing there.
4072,I,
4073,I,It is thus that the imagination of our time has relapsed into
4074,I,barbarism. But discipline of the heart and fancy is always so rare
4075,I,a thing that the neglect of it need not be supposed to involve any
4076,I,very terrible or obvious loss. The triumphs of reason have been few
4077,I,"and partial at any time, and perfect works of art are almost unknown."
4078,I,"The failure of art and reason, because their principle is ignored, is"
4079,I,"therefore hardly more conspicuous than it was when their principle,"
4080,I,"although perhaps acknowledged, was misunderstood or disobeyed. Indeed,"
4081,I,"to one who fixes his eye on the ideal goal, the greatest art often"
4082,I,"seems the greatest failure, because it alone reminds him of what it"
4083,I,"should have been. Trivial stimulations coming from vulgar objects, on"
4084,I,"the contrary, by making us forget altogether the possibility of a deep"
4085,I,"satisfaction, often succeed in interesting and in winning applause."
4086,I,The pleasure they give us is so brief and superficial that the wave of
4087,I,essential disappointment which would ultimately drown it has not time
4088,I,to rise from the heart.
4089,I,
4090,I,The poetry of barbarism is not without its charm. It can play with
4091,I,sense and passion the more readily and freely in that it does not
4092,I,aspire to subordinate them to a clear thought or a tenable attitude of
4093,I,the will. It can impart the transitive emotions which it expresses; it
4094,I,"can find many partial harmonies of mood and fancy; it can, by virtue"
4095,I,"of its red-hot irrationality, utter wilder cries, surrender itself"
4096,I,"and us to more absolute passion, and heap up a more indiscriminate"
4097,I,wealth of images than belong to poets of seasoned experience or of
4098,I,"heavenly inspiration. Irrational stimulation may tire us in the end,"
4099,I,"but it excites us in the beginning; and how many conventional poets,"
4100,I,"tender and prolix, have there not been, who tire us now without ever"
4101,I,having excited anybody? The power to stimulate is the beginning of
4102,I,"greatness, and when the barbarous poet has genius, as he well may"
4103,I,"have, he stimulates all the more powerfully on account of the crudity"
4104,I,of his methods and the recklessness of his emotions. The defects
4105,I,"of such art--lack of distinction, absence of beauty, confusion of"
4106,I,"ideas, incapacity permanently to please--will hardly be felt by the"
4107,I,"contemporary public, if once its attention is arrested; for no poet"
4108,I,"is so undisciplined that he will not find many readers, if he finds"
4109,I,"readers at all, less disciplined than himself."
4110,I,
4111,I,These considerations may perhaps be best enforced by applying them to
4112,I,two writers of great influence over the present generation who seem to
4113,I,illustrate them on different planes--Robert Browning and Walt Whitman.
4114,I,They are both analytic poets--poets who seek to reveal and express
4115,I,the elemental as opposed to the conventional; but the dissolution
4116,I,"has progressed much farther in Whitman than in Browning, doubtless"
4117,I,because Whitman began at a much lower stage of moral and intellectual
4118,I,organization; for the good will to be radical was present in both.
4119,I,"The elements to which Browning reduces experience are still passions,"
4120,I,"characters, persons; Whitman carries the disintegration further and"
4121,I,knows nothing but moods and particular images. The world of Browning
4122,I,is a world of history with civilization for its setting and with the
4123,I,conventional passions for its motive forces. The world of Whitman
4124,I,is innocent of these things and contains only far simpler and more
4125,I,"chaotic elements. In him the barbarism is much more pronounced; it is,"
4126,I,"indeed, avowed, and the ""barbaric yawp"" is sent ""over the roofs of the"
4127,I,"world"" in full consciousness of its inarticulate character; but in"
4128,I,Browning the barbarism is no less real though disguised by a literary
4129,I,"and scientific language, since the passions of civilized life with"
4130,I,"which he deals are treated as so many ""barbaric yawps,"" complex indeed"
4131,I,"in their conditions, puffings of an intricate engine, but aimless in"
4132,I,their vehemence and mere ebullitions of lustiness in adventurous and
4133,I,profoundly ungoverned souls.
4134,I,
4135,I,Irrationality on this level is viewed by Browning with the same
4136,I,"satisfaction with which, on a lower level, it is viewed by Whitman;"
4137,I,and the admirers of each hail it as the secret of a new poetry
4138,I,which pierces to the quick and awakens the imagination to a new and
4139,I,"genuine vitality. It is in the rebellion against discipline, in the"
4140,I,"abandonment of the ideals of classic and Christian tradition, that this"
4141,I,"rejuvenation is found. Both poets represent, therefore, and are admired"
4142,I,"for representing, what may be called the poetry of barbarism in the"
4143,I,most accurate and descriptive sense of this word. For the barbarian
4144,I,is the man who regards his passions as their own excuse for being;
4145,I,who does not domesticate them either by understanding their cause or
4146,I,by conceiving their ideal goal. He is the man who does not know his
4147,I,"derivations nor perceive his tendencies, but who merely feels and acts,"
4148,I,"valuing in his life its force and its filling, but being careless of"
4149,I,its purpose and its form. His delight is in abundance and vehemence;
4150,I,"his art, like his life, shows an exclusive respect for quantity and"
4151,I,splendour of materials. His scorn for what is poorer and weaker than
4152,I,himself is only surpassed by his ignorance of what is higher.

4159,WALT WHITMAN,WALT WHITMAN
4160,WALT WHITMAN,
4161,WALT WHITMAN,The works of Walt Whitman offer an extreme illustration of this
4162,WALT WHITMAN,"phase of genius, both by their form, and by their substance. It was"
4163,WALT WHITMAN,the singularity of his literary form--the challenge it threw to
4164,WALT WHITMAN,the conventions of verse and of language--that first gave Whitman
4165,WALT WHITMAN,"notoriety: but this notoriety has become fame, because those"
4166,WALT WHITMAN,incapacities and solecisms which glare at us from his pages are only
4167,WALT WHITMAN,the obverse of a profound inspiration and of a genuine courage.
4168,WALT WHITMAN,Even the idiosyncrasies of his style have a side which is not mere
4169,WALT WHITMAN,"perversity or affectation; the order of his words, the procession of"
4170,WALT WHITMAN,"his images, reproduce the method of a rich, spontaneous, absolutely"
4171,WALT WHITMAN,lazy fancy. In most poets such a natural order is modified by various
4172,WALT WHITMAN,"governing motives--the thought, the metrical form, the echo of other"
4173,WALT WHITMAN,poems in the memory. By Walt Whitman these conventional influences are
4174,WALT WHITMAN,resolutely banished. We find the swarms of men and objects rendered
4175,WALT WHITMAN,as they might strike the retina in a sort of waking dream. It is
4176,WALT WHITMAN,the most sincere possible confession of the lowest--I mean the most
4177,WALT WHITMAN,primitive--type of perception. All ancient poets are sophisticated in
4178,WALT WHITMAN,comparison and give proof of longer intellectual and moral training.
4179,WALT WHITMAN,"Walt Whitman has gone back to the innocent style of Adam, when the"
4180,WALT WHITMAN,animals filed before him one by one and he called each of them by its
4181,WALT WHITMAN,name.
4182,WALT WHITMAN,
4183,WALT WHITMAN,"In fact, the influences to which Walt Whitman was subject were as"
4184,WALT WHITMAN,favourable as possible to the imaginary experiment of beginning the
4185,WALT WHITMAN,world over again. Liberalism and transcendentalism both harboured
4186,WALT WHITMAN,some illusions on that score; and they were in the air which our
4187,WALT WHITMAN,"poet breathed. Moreover he breathed this air in America, where the"
4188,WALT WHITMAN,newness of the material environment made it easier to ignore the
4189,WALT WHITMAN,fatal antiquity of human nature. When he afterward became aware that
4190,WALT WHITMAN,"there was or had been a world with a history, he studied that world"
4191,WALT WHITMAN,with curiosity and spoke of it not without a certain shrewdness. But
4192,WALT WHITMAN,"he still regarded it as a foreign world and imagined, as not a few"
4193,WALT WHITMAN,"Americans have done, that his own world was a fresh creation, not"
4194,WALT WHITMAN,amenable to the same laws as the old. The difference in the conditions
4195,WALT WHITMAN,"blinded him, in his merely sensuous apprehension, to the identity of"
4196,WALT WHITMAN,the principles.
4197,WALT WHITMAN,
4198,WALT WHITMAN,His parents were farmers in central Long Island and his early years
4199,WALT WHITMAN,were spent in that district. The family seems to have been not too
4200,WALT WHITMAN,prosperous and somewhat nomadic; Whitman himself drifted through
4201,WALT WHITMAN,"boyhood without much guidance. We find him now at school, now helping"
4202,WALT WHITMAN,"the labourers at the farms, now wandering along the beaches of Long"
4203,WALT WHITMAN,"Island, finally at Brooklyn working in an apparently desultory way as"
4204,WALT WHITMAN,a printer and sometimes as a writer for a local newspaper. He must
4205,WALT WHITMAN,"have read or heard something, at this early period, of the English"
4206,WALT WHITMAN,classics; his style often betrays the deep effect made upon him by the
4207,WALT WHITMAN,"grandiloquence of the Bible, of Shakespeare, and of Milton. But his"
4208,WALT WHITMAN,"chief interest, if we may trust his account, was already in his own"
4209,WALT WHITMAN,"sensations. The aspects of Nature, the forms and habits of animals,"
4210,WALT WHITMAN,"the sights of cities, the movement and talk of common people, were his"
4211,WALT WHITMAN,"constant delight. His mind was flooded with these images, keenly felt"
4212,WALT WHITMAN,and afterward to be vividly rendered with bold strokes of realism and
4213,WALT WHITMAN,imagination.
4214,WALT WHITMAN,
4215,WALT WHITMAN,Many poets have had this faculty to seize the elementary aspects of
4216,WALT WHITMAN,"things, but none has had it so exclusively; with Whitman the surface"
4217,WALT WHITMAN,is absolutely all and the underlying structure is without interest and
4218,WALT WHITMAN,almost without existence. He had had no education and his natural
4219,WALT WHITMAN,delight in imbibing sensations had not been trained to the uses of
4220,WALT WHITMAN,practical or theoretical intelligence. He basked in the sunshine of
4221,WALT WHITMAN,"perception and wallowed in the stream of his own sensibility, as later"
4222,WALT WHITMAN,at Camden in the shallows of his favourite brook. Even during the civil
4223,WALT WHITMAN,"war, when he heard the drum-taps so clearly, he could only gaze at the"
4224,WALT WHITMAN,"picturesque and terrible aspects of the struggle, and linger among the"
4225,WALT WHITMAN,wounded day after day with a canine devotion; he could not be aroused
4226,WALT WHITMAN,either to clear thought or to positive action. So also in his poems; a
4227,WALT WHITMAN,multiplicity of images pass before him and he yields himself to each
4228,WALT WHITMAN,in turn with absolute passivity. The world has no inside; it is a
4229,WALT WHITMAN,"phantasmagoria of continuous visions, vivid, impressive, but monotonous"
4230,WALT WHITMAN,"and hard to distinguish in memory, like the waves of the sea or the"
4231,WALT WHITMAN,"decorations of some barbarous temple, sublime only by the infinite"
4232,WALT WHITMAN,aggregation of parts.
4233,WALT WHITMAN,
4234,WALT WHITMAN,"This abundance of detail without organization, this wealth of"
4235,WALT WHITMAN,"perception without intelligence and of imagination without taste, makes"
4236,WALT WHITMAN,"the singularity of Whitman's genius. Full of sympathy and receptivity,"
4237,WALT WHITMAN,with a wonderful gift of graphic characterization and an occasional
4238,WALT WHITMAN,"rare grandeur of diction, he fills us with a sense of the individuality"
4239,WALT WHITMAN,and the universality of what he describes--it is a drop in itself yet a
4240,WALT WHITMAN,drop in the ocean. The absence of any principle of selection or of a
4241,WALT WHITMAN,sustained style enables him to render aspects of things and of emotion
4242,WALT WHITMAN,"which would have eluded a trained writer. He is, therefore, interesting"
4243,WALT WHITMAN,"even where he is grotesque or perverse. He has accomplished, by the"
4244,WALT WHITMAN,"sacrifice of almost every other good quality, something never so well"
4245,WALT WHITMAN,done before. He has approached common life without bringing in his
4246,WALT WHITMAN,"mind any higher standard by which to criticise it; he has seen it,"
4247,WALT WHITMAN,"not in contrast with an ideal, but as the expression of forces more"
4248,WALT WHITMAN,"indeterminate and elementary than itself; and the vulgar, in this"
4249,WALT WHITMAN,"cosmic setting, has appeared to him sublime."
4250,WALT WHITMAN,
4251,WALT WHITMAN,There is clearly some analogy between a mass of images without
4252,WALT WHITMAN,"structure and the notion of an absolute democracy. Whitman, inclined"
4253,WALT WHITMAN,"by his genius and habits to see life without relief or organization,"
4254,WALT WHITMAN,believed that his inclination in this respect corresponded with the
4255,WALT WHITMAN,"spirit of his age and country, and that Nature and society, at least"
4256,WALT WHITMAN,"in the United States, were constituted after the fashion of his own"
4257,WALT WHITMAN,"mind. Being the poet of the average man, he wished, all men to be"
4258,WALT WHITMAN,"specimens of that average, and being the poet of a fluid Nature, he"
4259,WALT WHITMAN,believed that Nature was or should be a formless flux. This personal
4260,WALT WHITMAN,bias of Whitman's was further encouraged by the actual absence of
4261,WALT WHITMAN,distinction in his immediate environment. Surrounded by ugly things
4262,WALT WHITMAN,"and common people, he felt himself happy, ecstatic, overflowing with a"
4263,WALT WHITMAN,kind of patriarchal love. He accordingly came to think that there was
4264,WALT WHITMAN,"a spirit of the New World which he embodied, and which was in complete"
4265,WALT WHITMAN,"opposition to that of the Old, and that a literature upon novel"
4266,WALT WHITMAN,principles was needed to express and strengthen this American spirit.
4267,WALT WHITMAN,
4268,WALT WHITMAN,Democracy was not to be merely a constitutional device for the better
4269,WALT WHITMAN,"government of given nations, not merely a movement for the material"
4270,WALT WHITMAN,improvement of the lot of the poorer classes. It was to be a social
4271,WALT WHITMAN,and a moral democracy and to involve an actual equality among all
4272,WALT WHITMAN,men. Whatever kept them apart and made it impossible for them to be
4273,WALT WHITMAN,messmates together was to be discarded. The literature of democracy
4274,WALT WHITMAN,"was to ignore all extraordinary gifts of genius or virtue, all"
4275,WALT WHITMAN,distinction drawn even from great passions or romantic adventures. In
4276,WALT WHITMAN,"Whitman's works, in which this new literature is foreshadowed, there"
4277,WALT WHITMAN,is accordingly not a single character nor a single story. His only
4278,WALT WHITMAN,"hero is Myself, the ""single separate person,"" endowed with the primary"
4279,WALT WHITMAN,"impulses, with health, and with sensitiveness to the elementary aspects"
4280,WALT WHITMAN,"of Nature. The perfect man of the future, the prolific begetter of"
4281,WALT WHITMAN,"other perfect men, is to work with his hands, chanting the poems of"
4282,WALT WHITMAN,"some future Walt, some ideally democratic bard. Women are to have"
4283,WALT WHITMAN,as nearly as possible the same character as men: the emphasis is to
4284,WALT WHITMAN,pass from family life and local ties to the friendship of comrades and
4285,WALT WHITMAN,"the general brotherhood of man. Men are to be vigorous, comfortable,"
4286,WALT WHITMAN,"sentimental, and irresponsible."
4287,WALT WHITMAN,
4288,WALT WHITMAN,"This dream is, of course, unrealized and unrealizable, in America as"
4289,WALT WHITMAN,elsewhere. Undeniably there are in America many suggestions of such
4290,WALT WHITMAN,a society and such a national character. But the growing complexity
4291,WALT WHITMAN,and fixity of institutions necessarily tends to obscure these traits
4292,WALT WHITMAN,of a primitive and crude democracy. What Whitman seized upon as the
4293,WALT WHITMAN,promise of the future was in reality the survival of the past. He
4294,WALT WHITMAN,"sings the song of pioneers, but it is in the nature of the pioneer"
4295,WALT WHITMAN,that the greater his success the quicker must be his transformation
4296,WALT WHITMAN,into something different. When Whitman made the initial and amorphous
4297,WALT WHITMAN,"phase of society his ideal, he became the prophet of a lost cause."
4298,WALT WHITMAN,"That cause was lost, not merely when wealth and intelligence began"
4299,WALT WHITMAN,"to take shape in the American Commonwealth, but it was lost at the"
4300,WALT WHITMAN,"very foundation of the world, when those laws of evolution were"
4301,WALT WHITMAN,"established which Whitman, like Rousseau, failed to understand. If we"
4302,WALT WHITMAN,"may trust Mr. Herbert Spencer, these laws involve a passage from the"
4303,WALT WHITMAN,"homogeneous to the heterogeneous, and a constant progress at once in"
4304,WALT WHITMAN,"differentiation and in organization--all, in a word, that Whitman"
4305,WALT WHITMAN,systematically deprecated or ignored. He is surely not the spokesman
4306,WALT WHITMAN,"of the tendencies of his country, although he describes some aspects"
4307,WALT WHITMAN,of its past and present condition: nor does he appeal to those whom he
4308,WALT WHITMAN,"describes, but rather to the _dilettanti_ he despises. He is regarded"
4309,WALT WHITMAN,"as representative chiefly by foreigners, who look for some grotesque"
4310,WALT WHITMAN,expression of the genius of so young and prodigious a people.
4311,WALT WHITMAN,
4312,WALT WHITMAN,"Whitman, it is true, loved and comprehended men; but this love and"
4313,WALT WHITMAN,comprehension had the same limits as his love and comprehension of
4314,WALT WHITMAN,Nature. He observed truly and responded to his observation with genuine
4315,WALT WHITMAN,"and pervasive emotion. A great gregariousness, an innocent tolerance of"
4316,WALT WHITMAN,"moral weakness, a genuine admiration for bodily health and strength,"
4317,WALT WHITMAN,made him bubble over with affection for the generic human creature.
4318,WALT WHITMAN,"Incapable of an ideal passion, he was full of the milk of human"
4319,WALT WHITMAN,"kindness. Yet, for all his acquaintance with the ways and thoughts of"
4320,WALT WHITMAN,"the common man of his choice, he did not truly understand him. For to"
4321,WALT WHITMAN,understand people is to go much deeper than they go themselves; to
4322,WALT WHITMAN,penetrate to their characters and disentangle their inmost ideals.
4323,WALT WHITMAN,Whitman's insight into man did not go beyond a sensuous sympathy;
4324,WALT WHITMAN,"it consisted in a vicarious satisfaction in their pleasures, and an"
4325,WALT WHITMAN,instinctive love of their persons. It never approached a scientific or
4326,WALT WHITMAN,imaginative knowledge of their hearts.
4327,WALT WHITMAN,
4328,WALT WHITMAN,Therefore Whitman failed radically in his dearest ambition: he can
4329,WALT WHITMAN,"never be a poet of the people. For the people, like the early races"
4330,WALT WHITMAN,"whose poetry was ideal, are natural believers in perfection. They"
4331,WALT WHITMAN,have no doubts about the absolute desirability of wealth and learning
4332,WALT WHITMAN,"and power, none about the worth of pure goodness and pure love. Their"
4333,WALT WHITMAN,"chosen poets, if they have any, will be always those who have known how"
4334,WALT WHITMAN,to paint these ideals in lively even if in gaudy colours. Nothing is
4335,WALT WHITMAN,farther from the common people than the corrupt desire to be primitive.
4336,WALT WHITMAN,"They instinctively look toward a more exalted life, which they imagine"
4337,WALT WHITMAN,"to be full of distinction and pleasure, and the idea of that brighter"
4338,WALT WHITMAN,existence fills them with hope or with envy or with humble admiration.
4339,WALT WHITMAN,
4340,WALT WHITMAN,"If the people are ever won over to hostility to such ideals, it is"
4341,WALT WHITMAN,only because they are cheated by demagogues who tell them that if
4342,WALT WHITMAN,all the flowers of civilization were destroyed its fruits would
4343,WALT WHITMAN,"become more abundant. A greater share of happiness, people think,"
4344,WALT WHITMAN,would fall to their lot could they destroy everything beyond their
4345,WALT WHITMAN,own possible possessions. But they are made thus envious and ignoble
4346,WALT WHITMAN,only by a deception: what they really desire is an ideal good for
4347,WALT WHITMAN,themselves which they are told they may secure by depriving others of
4348,WALT WHITMAN,their preeminence. Their hope is always to enjoy perfect satisfaction
4349,WALT WHITMAN,themselves; and therefore a poet who loves the picturesque aspects of
4350,WALT WHITMAN,labour and vagrancy will hardly be the poet of the poor. He may have
4351,WALT WHITMAN,"described their figure and occupation, in neither of which they are"
4352,WALT WHITMAN,much interested; he will not have read their souls. They will prefer
4353,WALT WHITMAN,"to him any sentimental story-teller, any sensational dramatist, any"
4354,WALT WHITMAN,"moralizing poet; for they are hero-worshippers by temperament, and are"
4355,WALT WHITMAN,too wise or too unfortunate to be much enamoured of themselves or of
4356,WALT WHITMAN,the conditions of their existence.
4357,WALT WHITMAN,
4358,WALT WHITMAN,"Fortunately, the political theory that makes Whitman's principle of"
4359,WALT WHITMAN,"literary prophecy and criticism does not always inspire his chants, nor"
4360,WALT WHITMAN,"is it presented, even in his prose works, quite bare and unadorned."
4361,WALT WHITMAN,"In ""Democratic Vistas"" we find it clothed with something of the same"
4362,WALT WHITMAN,poetic passion and lighted up with the same flashes of intuition which
4363,WALT WHITMAN,we admire in the poems. Even there the temperament is finer than
4364,WALT WHITMAN,the ideas and the poet wiser than the thinker. His ultimate appeal
4365,WALT WHITMAN,is really to something more primitive and general than any social
4366,WALT WHITMAN,"aspirations, to something more elementary than an ideal of any kind. He"
4367,WALT WHITMAN,speaks to those minds and to those moods in which sensuality is touched
4368,WALT WHITMAN,"with mysticism. When the intellect is in abeyance, when we would ""turn"
4369,WALT WHITMAN,"and live with the animals, they are so placid and self-contained,"""
4370,WALT WHITMAN,"when we are weary of conscience and of ambition, and would yield"
4371,WALT WHITMAN,"ourselves for a while to the dream of sense, Walt Whitman is a welcome"
4372,WALT WHITMAN,"companion. The images he arouses in us, fresh, full of light and health"
4373,WALT WHITMAN,"and of a kind of frankness and beauty, are prized all the more at such"
4374,WALT WHITMAN,"a time because they are not choice, but drawn perhaps from a hideous"
4375,WALT WHITMAN,and sordid environment. For this circumstance makes them a better means
4376,WALT WHITMAN,of escape from convention and from that fatigue and despair which
4377,WALT WHITMAN,lurk not far beneath the surface of conventional life. In casting off
4378,WALT WHITMAN,with self-assurance and a sense of fresh vitality the distinctions of
4379,WALT WHITMAN,"tradition and reason a man may feel, as he sinks back comfortably to"
4380,WALT WHITMAN,"a lower level of sense and instinct, that he is returning to Nature"
4381,WALT WHITMAN,or escaping into the infinite. Mysticism makes us proud and happy to
4382,WALT WHITMAN,"renounce the work of intelligence, both in thought and in life, and"
4383,WALT WHITMAN,persuades us that we become divine by remaining imperfectly human. Walt
4384,WALT WHITMAN,Whitman gives a new expression to this ancient and multiform tendency.
4385,WALT WHITMAN,He feels his own cosmic justification and he would lend the sanction
4386,WALT WHITMAN,of his inspiration to all loafers and holiday-makers. He would be the
4387,WALT WHITMAN,congenial patron of farmers and factory hands in their crude pleasures
4388,WALT WHITMAN,"and pieties, as Pan was the patron of the shepherds of Arcadia: for"
4389,WALT WHITMAN,"he is sure that in spite of his hairiness and animality, the gods"
4390,WALT WHITMAN,will acknowledge him as one of themselves and smile upon him from the
4391,WALT WHITMAN,serenity of Olympus.

4398,ROBERT BROWNING,
4399,ROBERT BROWNING,"If we would do justice to Browning's work as a human document, and"
4400,ROBERT BROWNING,at the same time perceive its relation to the rational ideals of
4401,ROBERT BROWNING,"the imagination and to that poetry which passes into religion, we"
4402,ROBERT BROWNING,"must keep, as in the case of Whitman, two things in mind. One is the"
4403,ROBERT BROWNING,"genuineness of the achievement, the sterling quality of the vision and"
4404,ROBERT BROWNING,inspiration; these are their own justification when we approach them
4405,ROBERT BROWNING,from below and regard them as manifesting a more direct or impassioned
4406,ROBERT BROWNING,"grasp of experience than is given to mildly blatant, convention-ridden"
4407,ROBERT BROWNING,minds. The other thing to remember is the short distance to which this
4408,ROBERT BROWNING,"comprehension is carried, its failure to approach any finality, or to"
4409,ROBERT BROWNING,achieve a recognition even of the traditional ideals of poetry and
4410,ROBERT BROWNING,religion.
4411,ROBERT BROWNING,
4412,ROBERT BROWNING,In the case of Walt Whitman such a failure will be generally felt;
4413,ROBERT BROWNING,it is obvious that both his music and his philosophy are those of
4414,ROBERT BROWNING,"a barbarian, nay, almost of a savage. Accordingly there is need of"
4415,ROBERT BROWNING,dwelling rather on the veracity and simple dignity of his thought and
4416,ROBERT BROWNING,"art, on their expression of an order of ideas latent in all better"
4417,ROBERT BROWNING,experience. But in the case of Browning it is the success that is
4418,ROBERT BROWNING,obvious to most people. Apart from a certain superficial grotesqueness
4419,ROBERT BROWNING,"to which we are soon accustomed, he easily arouses and engages the"
4420,ROBERT BROWNING,"reader by the pithiness of his phrase, the volume of his passion, the"
4421,ROBERT BROWNING,"vigour of his moral judgment, the liveliness of his historical fancy."
4422,ROBERT BROWNING,"It is obvious that we are in the presence of a great writer, of a great"
4423,ROBERT BROWNING,"imaginative force, of a master in the expression of emotion. What"
4424,ROBERT BROWNING,"is perhaps not so obvious, but no less true, is that we are in the"
4425,ROBERT BROWNING,"presence of a barbaric genius, of a truncated imagination, of a thought"
4426,ROBERT BROWNING,"and an art inchoate and ill-digested, of a volcanic eruption that"
4427,ROBERT BROWNING,tosses itself quite blindly and ineffectually into the sky.
4428,ROBERT BROWNING,
4429,ROBERT BROWNING,The points of comparison by which this becomes clear are perhaps
4430,ROBERT BROWNING,"not in every one's mind, although they are merely the elements of"
4431,ROBERT BROWNING,"traditional culture, æsthetic and moral. Yet even without reference"
4432,ROBERT BROWNING,"to ultimate ideals, one may notice in Browning many superficial signs"
4433,ROBERT BROWNING,"of that deepest of all failures, the failure in rationality and the"
4434,ROBERT BROWNING,"indifference to perfection. Such a sign is the turgid style, weighty"
4435,ROBERT BROWNING,"without nobility, pointed without naturalness or precision. Another"
4436,ROBERT BROWNING,"sign is the ""realism"" of the personages, who, quite like men and women"
4437,ROBERT BROWNING,"in actual life, are always displaying traits of character and never"
4438,ROBERT BROWNING,attaining character as a whole. Other hints might be found in the
4439,ROBERT BROWNING,"structure of the poems, where the dramatic substance does not achieve"
4440,ROBERT BROWNING,"a dramatic form; in the metaphysical discussion, with its confused"
4441,ROBERT BROWNING,"prolixity and absence of result; in the moral ideal, where all energies"
4442,ROBERT BROWNING,"figure without their ultimate purposes; in the religion, which breaks"
4443,ROBERT BROWNING,"off the expression of this life in the middle, and finds in that"
4444,ROBERT BROWNING,"suspense an argument for immortality. In all this, and much more that"
4445,ROBERT BROWNING,"might be recalled, a person coming to Browning with the habits of a"
4446,ROBERT BROWNING,cultivated mind might see evidence of some profound incapacity in
4447,ROBERT BROWNING,the poet; but more careful reflection is necessary to understand the
4448,ROBERT BROWNING,"nature of this incapacity, its cause, and the peculiar accent which its"
4449,ROBERT BROWNING,presence gives to those ideas and impulses which Browning stimulates in
4450,ROBERT BROWNING,us.
4451,ROBERT BROWNING,
4452,ROBERT BROWNING,There is the more reason for developing this criticism (which might
4453,ROBERT BROWNING,seem needlessly hostile and which time and posterity will doubtless
4454,ROBERT BROWNING,make in their own quiet and decisive fashion) in that Browning did not
4455,ROBERT BROWNING,"keep within the sphere of drama and analysis, where he was strong, but"
4456,ROBERT BROWNING,allowed his own temperament and opinions to vitiate his representation
4457,ROBERT BROWNING,"of life, so that he sometimes turned the expression of a violent"
4458,ROBERT BROWNING,passion into the last word of what he thought a religion. He had a
4459,ROBERT BROWNING,"didactic vein, a habit of judging the spectacle he evoked and of"
4460,ROBERT BROWNING,loading the passions he depicted with his visible sympathy or scorn.
4461,ROBERT BROWNING,
4462,ROBERT BROWNING,"Now a chief support of Browning's popularity is that he is, for"
4463,ROBERT BROWNING,"many, an initiator into the deeper mysteries of passion, a means of"
4464,ROBERT BROWNING,escaping from the moral poverty of their own lives and of feeling the
4465,ROBERT BROWNING,"rhythm and compulsion of the general striving. He figures, therefore,"
4466,ROBERT BROWNING,"distinctly as a prophet, as a bearer of glad tidings, and it is easy"
4467,ROBERT BROWNING,"for those who hail him as such to imagine that, knowing the labour of"
4468,ROBERT BROWNING,"life so well, he must know something also of its fruits, and that in"
4469,ROBERT BROWNING,"giving us the feeling of existence, he is also giving us its meaning."
4470,ROBERT BROWNING,There is serious danger that a mind gathering from his pages the raw
4471,ROBERT BROWNING,"materials of truth, the unthreshed harvest of reality, may take him for"
4472,ROBERT BROWNING,"a philosopher, for a rationalizer of what he describes. Awakening may"
4473,ROBERT BROWNING,"be mistaken for enlightenment, and the galvanizing of torpid sensations"
4474,ROBERT BROWNING,and impulses for wisdom.
4475,ROBERT BROWNING,
4476,ROBERT BROWNING,Against such fatuity reason should raise her voice. The vital and
4477,ROBERT BROWNING,historic forces that produce illusions of this sort in large groups of
4478,ROBERT BROWNING,men are indeed beyond the control of criticism. The ideas of passion
4479,ROBERT BROWNING,"are more vivid than those of memory, until they become memories in"
4480,ROBERT BROWNING,turn. They must be allowed to fight out their desperate battle against
4481,ROBERT BROWNING,"the laws of Nature and reason. But it is worth while in the meantime,"
4482,ROBERT BROWNING,"for the sake of the truth and of a just philosophy, to meet the varying"
4483,ROBERT BROWNING,though perpetual charlatanism of the world with a steady protest. As
4484,ROBERT BROWNING,"soon as Browning is proposed to us as a leader, as soon as we are asked"
4485,ROBERT BROWNING,"to be not the occasional patrons of his art, but the pupils of his"
4486,ROBERT BROWNING,"philosophy, we have a right to express the radical dissatisfaction"
4487,ROBERT BROWNING,"which we must feel, if we are rational, with his whole attitude and"
4488,ROBERT BROWNING,temper of mind.
4489,ROBERT BROWNING,
4490,ROBERT BROWNING,The great dramatists have seldom dealt with perfectly virtuous
4491,ROBERT BROWNING,characters. The great poets have seldom represented mythologies that
4492,ROBERT BROWNING,would bear scientific criticism. But by an instinct which constituted
4493,ROBERT BROWNING,their greatness they have cast these mixed materials furnished by life
4494,ROBERT BROWNING,"into forms congenial to the specific principles of their art, and by"
4495,ROBERT BROWNING,this transformation they have made acceptable in the æsthetic sphere
4496,ROBERT BROWNING,"things that in the sphere of reality were evil or imperfect: in a word,"
4497,ROBERT BROWNING,"their works have been beautiful as works of art. Or, if their genius"
4498,ROBERT BROWNING,"exceeded that of the technical poet and rose to prophetic intuition,"
4499,ROBERT BROWNING,"they have known how to create ideal characters, not possessed, perhaps,"
4500,ROBERT BROWNING,"of every virtue accidentally needed in this world, but possessed of"
4501,ROBERT BROWNING,"what is ideally better, of internal greatness and perfection. They"
4502,ROBERT BROWNING,have also known how to select and reconstruct their mythology so as to
4503,ROBERT BROWNING,make it a true interpretation of moral life. When we read the maxims
4504,ROBERT BROWNING,"of Iago, Falstaff, or Hamlet, we are delighted if the thought strikes"
4505,ROBERT BROWNING,"us as true, but we are not less delighted if it strikes us as false."
4506,ROBERT BROWNING,These characters are not presented to us in order to enlarge our
4507,ROBERT BROWNING,capacities of passion nor in order to justify themselves as processes
4508,ROBERT BROWNING,"of redemption; they are there, clothed in poetry and imbedded in plot,"
4509,ROBERT BROWNING,to entertain us with their imaginable feelings and their interesting
4510,ROBERT BROWNING,"errors. The poet, without being especially a philosopher, stands by"
4511,ROBERT BROWNING,"virtue of his superlative genius on the plane of universal reason, far"
4512,ROBERT BROWNING,above the passionate experience which he overlooks and on which he
4513,ROBERT BROWNING,"reflects; and he raises us for the moment to his own level, to send"
4514,ROBERT BROWNING,"us back again, if not better endowed for practical life, at least not"
4515,ROBERT BROWNING,unacquainted with speculation.
4516,ROBERT BROWNING,
4517,ROBERT BROWNING,With Browning the case is essentially different. When his heroes are
4518,ROBERT BROWNING,"blinded by passion and warped by circumstance, as they almost always"
4519,ROBERT BROWNING,"are, he does not describe the fact from the vantage-ground of the"
4520,ROBERT BROWNING,intellect and invite us to look at it from that point of view. On the
4521,ROBERT BROWNING,"contrary, his art is all self-expression or satire. For the most part"
4522,ROBERT BROWNING,"his hero, like Whitman's, is himself; not appearing, as in the case"
4523,ROBERT BROWNING,"of the American bard, _in puris naturalibus,_ but masked in all sorts"
4524,ROBERT BROWNING,"of historical and romantic finery. Sometimes, however, the personage,"
4525,ROBERT BROWNING,"like Guido in ""The Ring and the Book"" or the ""frustrate ghosts"" of"
4526,ROBERT BROWNING,"other poems, is merely a Marsyas, shown flayed and quivering to the"
4527,ROBERT BROWNING,greater glory of the poet's ideal Apollo. The impulsive utterances and
4528,ROBERT BROWNING,the crudities of most of the speakers are passionately adopted by the
4529,ROBERT BROWNING,poet as his own. He thus perverts what might have been a triumph of
4530,ROBERT BROWNING,imagination into a failure of reason.
4531,ROBERT BROWNING,
4532,ROBERT BROWNING,"This circumstance has much to do with the fact that Browning, in spite"
4533,ROBERT BROWNING,"of his extraordinary gift for expressing emotion, has hardly produced"
4534,ROBERT BROWNING,works purely and unconditionally delightful. They not only portray
4535,ROBERT BROWNING,"passion, which is interesting, but they betray it, which is odious."
4536,ROBERT BROWNING,"His art was still in the service of the will. He had not attained, in"
4537,ROBERT BROWNING,"studying the beauty of things, that detachment of the phenomenon, that"
4538,ROBERT BROWNING,"love of the form for its own sake, which is the secret of contemplative"
4539,ROBERT BROWNING,"satisfaction. Therefore, the lamentable accidents of his personality"
4540,ROBERT BROWNING,"and opinions, in themselves no worse than those of other mortals,"
4541,ROBERT BROWNING,passed into his art. He did not seek to elude them: he had no free
4542,ROBERT BROWNING,"speculative faculty to dominate them by. Or, to put the same thing"
4543,ROBERT BROWNING,"differently, he was too much in earnest in his fictions, he threw"
4544,ROBERT BROWNING,"himself too unreservedly into his creations. His imagination, like"
4545,ROBERT BROWNING,"the imagination we have in dreams, was merely a vent for personal"
4546,ROBERT BROWNING,preoccupations. His art was inspired by purposes less simple and
4547,ROBERT BROWNING,universal than the ends of imagination itself. His play of mind
4548,ROBERT BROWNING,consequently could not be free or pure. The creative impulse could not
4549,ROBERT BROWNING,reach its goal or manifest in any notable degree its own organic ideal.
4550,ROBERT BROWNING,
4551,ROBERT BROWNING,We may illustrate these assertions by considering Browning's treatment
4552,ROBERT BROWNING,"of the passion of love, a passion to which he gives great prominence"
4553,ROBERT BROWNING,and in which he finds the highest significance.
4554,ROBERT BROWNING,
4555,ROBERT BROWNING,"Love is depicted by Browning with truth, with vehemence, and with"
4556,ROBERT BROWNING,the constant conviction that it is the supreme thing in life. The
4557,ROBERT BROWNING,great variety of occasions in which it appears in his pages and the
4558,ROBERT BROWNING,"different degrees of elaboration it receives, leave it always of the"
4559,ROBERT BROWNING,same quality--the quality of passion. It never sinks into sensuality;
4560,ROBERT BROWNING,"in spite of its frequent extreme crudeness, it is always, in Browning's"
4561,ROBERT BROWNING,"hands, a passion of the imagination, it is always love. On the other"
4562,ROBERT BROWNING,hand it never rises into contemplation: mingled as it may be with
4563,ROBERT BROWNING,"friendship, with religion, or with various forms of natural tenderness,"
4564,ROBERT BROWNING,"it always remains a passion; it always remains a personal impulse,"
4565,ROBERT BROWNING,"a hypnotization, with another person for its object or its cause."
4566,ROBERT BROWNING,"Kept within these limits it is represented, in a series of powerful"
4567,ROBERT BROWNING,"sketches, which are for most readers the gems of the Browning gallery,"
4568,ROBERT BROWNING,"as the last word of experience, the highest phase of human life."

4591,ROBERT BROWNING,"And lips to lips! Yet once more, ere we part,"
4592,ROBERT BROWNING,"Clasp me and make me thine, as mine thou art."""

4594,ROBERT BROWNING,"And he, after being surprised and stabbed in her arms, replies:--"

4601,ROBERT BROWNING,"To death, because they never lived, but I"
4602,ROBERT BROWNING,"Have lived indeed, and so--(yet one more kiss)--can die."""
4603,ROBERT BROWNING,
4604,ROBERT BROWNING,We are not allowed to regard these expressions as the cries of souls
4605,ROBERT BROWNING,blinded by the agony of passion and lust. Browning unmistakably adopts
4606,ROBERT BROWNING,them as expressing his own highest intuitions. He so much admires the
4607,ROBERT BROWNING,strength of this weakness that he does not admit that it is a weakness
4608,ROBERT BROWNING,"at all. It is with the strut of self-satisfaction, with the sensation,"
4609,ROBERT BROWNING,"almost, of muscular Christianity, that he boasts of it through the"
4610,ROBERT BROWNING,"mouth of one of his heroes, who is explaining to his mistress the"
4611,ROBERT BROWNING,motive of his faithful services as a minister of the queen:--
4612,ROBERT BROWNING,
4613,ROBERT BROWNING,"""She thinks there was more cause"
4614,ROBERT BROWNING,"In love of power, high fame, pure loyalty?"
4615,ROBERT BROWNING,Perhaps she fancies men wear out their lives
4616,ROBERT BROWNING,Chasing such shades....
4617,ROBERT BROWNING,"I worked because I want you with my soul."""
4618,ROBERT BROWNING,
4619,ROBERT BROWNING,Readers of the fifth chapter of this volume need not be reminded here
4620,ROBERT BROWNING,of the contrast which this method of understanding love offers to that
4621,ROBERT BROWNING,adopted by the real masters of passion and imagination. They began with
4622,ROBERT BROWNING,"that crude emotion with which Browning ends; they lived it down, they"
4623,ROBERT BROWNING,"exalted it by thought, they extracted the pure gold of it in a long"
4624,ROBERT BROWNING,purgation of discipline and suffering. The fierce paroxysm which for
4625,ROBERT BROWNING,"him is heaven, was for them the proof that heaven cannot be found on"
4626,ROBERT BROWNING,"earth, that the value of experience is not in experience itself but"
4627,ROBERT BROWNING,"in the ideals which it reveals. The intense, voluminous emotion, the"
4628,ROBERT BROWNING,"sudden, overwhelming self-surrender in which he rests was for them"
4629,ROBERT BROWNING,"the starting-point of a life of rational worship, of an austere and"
4630,ROBERT BROWNING,"impersonal religion, by which the fire of love, kindled for a moment by"
4631,ROBERT BROWNING,"the sight of some creature, was put, as it were, into a censer, to burn"
4632,ROBERT BROWNING,incense before every image of the Highest Good. Thus love ceased to be
4633,ROBERT BROWNING,a passion and became the energy of contemplation: it diffused over the
4634,ROBERT BROWNING,"universe, natural and ideal, that light of tenderness and that faculty"
4635,ROBERT BROWNING,of worship which the passion of love often is first to quicken in a
4636,ROBERT BROWNING,man's breast.
4637,ROBERT BROWNING,
4638,ROBERT BROWNING,"Of this art, recommended by Plato and practised in the Christian Church"
4639,ROBERT BROWNING,"by all adepts of the spiritual life, Browning knew absolutely nothing."
4640,ROBERT BROWNING,About the object of love he had no misgivings. What could the object
4641,ROBERT BROWNING,be except somebody or other? The important thing was to love intensely
4642,ROBERT BROWNING,and to love often. He remained in the phenomenal sphere: he was a lover
4643,ROBERT BROWNING,of experience; the ideal did not exist for him. No conception could be
4644,ROBERT BROWNING,farther from his thought than the essential conception of any rational
4645,ROBERT BROWNING,"philosophy, namely, that feeling is to be treated as raw material"
4646,ROBERT BROWNING,"for thought, and that the destiny of emotion is to pass into objects"
4647,ROBERT BROWNING,which shall contain all its value while losing all its formlessness.
4648,ROBERT BROWNING,This transformation of sense and emotion into objects agreeable to
4649,ROBERT BROWNING,"the intellect, into clear ideas and beautiful things, is the natural"
4650,ROBERT BROWNING,"work of reason; when it has been accomplished very imperfectly, or not"
4651,ROBERT BROWNING,"at all, we have a barbarous mind, a mind full of chaotic sensations,"
4652,ROBERT BROWNING,"objectless passions, and undigested ideas. Such a mind Browning's was,"
4653,ROBERT BROWNING,to a degree remarkable in one with so rich a heritage of civilization.
4654,ROBERT BROWNING,
4655,ROBERT BROWNING,"The nineteenth century, as we have already said, has nourished the hope"
4656,ROBERT BROWNING,of abolishing the past as a force while it studies it as an object; and
4657,ROBERT BROWNING,"Browning, with his fondness for a historical stage setting and for the"
4658,ROBERT BROWNING,"gossip of history, rebelled equally against the Pagan and the Christian"
4659,ROBERT BROWNING,"discipline. The ""Soul"" which he trusted in was the barbarous soul,"
4660,ROBERT BROWNING,"the ""Spontaneous Me"" of his half-brother Whitman. It was a restless"
4661,ROBERT BROWNING,"personal impulse, conscious of obscure depths within itself which it"
4662,ROBERT BROWNING,"fancied to be infinite, and of a certain vague sympathy with wind and"
4663,ROBERT BROWNING,cloud and with the universal mutation. It was the soul that might have
4664,ROBERT BROWNING,"animated Attila and Alaric when they came down into Italy, a soul not"
4665,ROBERT BROWNING,incurious of the tawdriness and corruption of the strange civilization
4666,ROBERT BROWNING,"it beheld, but incapable of understanding its original spirit; a soul"
4667,ROBERT BROWNING,"maintaining in the presence of that noble, unappreciated ruin all its"
4668,ROBERT BROWNING,"own lordliness and energy, and all its native vulgarity."
4669,ROBERT BROWNING,
4670,ROBERT BROWNING,"Browning, who had not had the education traditional in his own country,"
4671,ROBERT BROWNING,used to say that Italy had been his university. But it was a school for
4672,ROBERT BROWNING,"which he was ill prepared, and he did not sit under its best teachers."
4673,ROBERT BROWNING,"For the superficial ferment, the worldly passions, and the crimes of"
4674,ROBERT BROWNING,the Italian Renaissance he had a keen interest and intelligence. But
4675,ROBERT BROWNING,"Italy has been always a civilized country, and beneath the trappings"
4676,ROBERT BROWNING,and suits of civilization which at that particular time it flaunted
4677,ROBERT BROWNING,"so gayly, it preserved a civilized heart to which Browning's insight"
4678,ROBERT BROWNING,could never penetrate. There subsisted in the best minds a trained
4679,ROBERT BROWNING,"imagination and a cogent ideal of virtue. Italy had a religion, and"
4680,ROBERT BROWNING,"that religion permeated all its life, and was the background without"
4681,ROBERT BROWNING,which even its secular art and secular passions would not be truly
4682,ROBERT BROWNING,"intelligible. The most commanding and representative, the deepest and"
4683,ROBERT BROWNING,most appealing of Italian natures are permeated with this religious
4684,ROBERT BROWNING,"inspiration. A Saint Francis, a Dante, a Michael Angelo, breathe hardly"
4685,ROBERT BROWNING,anything else. Yet for Browning these men and what they represented
4686,ROBERT BROWNING,"may be said not to have existed. He saw, he studied, and he painted a"
4687,ROBERT BROWNING,decapitated Italy. His vision could not mount so high as her head.
4688,ROBERT BROWNING,
4689,ROBERT BROWNING,One of the elements of that higher tradition which Browning was not
4690,ROBERT BROWNING,prepared to imbibe was the idealization of love. The passion he
4691,ROBERT BROWNING,"represents is lava hot from the crater, in no way moulded, smelted,"
4692,ROBERT BROWNING,or refined. He had no thought of subjugating impulses into the
4693,ROBERT BROWNING,"harmony of reason. He did not master life, but was mastered by it."
4694,ROBERT BROWNING,Accordingly the love he describes has no wings; it issues in nothing.
4695,ROBERT BROWNING,"His lovers ""extinguish sight and speech, each on each""; sense, as"
4696,ROBERT BROWNING,"he says elsewhere, drowning soul. The man in the gondola may well"
4697,ROBERT BROWNING,boast that he can die; it is the only thing he can properly do.
4698,ROBERT BROWNING,Death is the only solution of a love that is tied to its individual
4699,ROBERT BROWNING,object and inseparable from the alloy of passion and illusion within
4700,ROBERT BROWNING,"itself. Browning's hero, because he has loved intensely, says that"
4701,ROBERT BROWNING,"he has lived; he would be right, if the significance of life were"
4702,ROBERT BROWNING,"to be measured by the intensity of the feeling it contained, and if"
4703,ROBERT BROWNING,intelligence were not the highest form of vitality. But had that hero
4704,ROBERT BROWNING,known how to love better and had he had enough spirit to dominate his
4705,ROBERT BROWNING,"love, he might perhaps have been able to carry away the better part of"
4706,ROBERT BROWNING,it and to say that he could not die; for one half of himself and of his
4707,ROBERT BROWNING,love would have been dead already and the other half would have been
4708,ROBERT BROWNING,"eternal, having fed--"
4709,ROBERT BROWNING,
4710,ROBERT BROWNING,"""On death, that feeds on men;"
4711,ROBERT BROWNING,"And death once dead, there's no more dying then."""
4712,ROBERT BROWNING,
4713,ROBERT BROWNING,"The irrationality of the passions which Browning glorifies, making them"
4714,ROBERT BROWNING,"the crown of life, is so gross that at times he cannot help perceiving"
4715,ROBERT BROWNING,it.
4716,ROBERT BROWNING,
4717,ROBERT BROWNING,"""How perplexed"
4718,ROBERT BROWNING,"Grows belief! Well, this cold clay clod"
4719,ROBERT BROWNING,Was man's heart:
4720,ROBERT BROWNING,"Crumble it, and what comes next? Is it God?"""
4721,ROBERT BROWNING,
4722,ROBERT BROWNING,"Yes, he will tell us. These passions and follies, however desperate in"
4723,ROBERT BROWNING,"themselves and however vain for the individual, are excellent as parts"
4724,ROBERT BROWNING,of the dispensation of Providence:--
4725,ROBERT BROWNING,
4726,ROBERT BROWNING,"""Be hate that fruit or love that fruit,"
4727,ROBERT BROWNING,"It forwards the general deed of man,"
4728,ROBERT BROWNING,And each of the many helps to recruit
4729,ROBERT BROWNING,"The life of the race by a general plan,"
4730,ROBERT BROWNING,"Each living his own to boot."""
4731,ROBERT BROWNING,
4732,ROBERT BROWNING,"If we doubt, then, the value of our own experience, even perhaps"
4733,ROBERT BROWNING,"of our experience of love, we may appeal to the interdependence of"
4734,ROBERT BROWNING,"goods and evils in the world to assure ourselves that, in view of"
4735,ROBERT BROWNING,"its consequences elsewhere, this experience was great and important"
4736,ROBERT BROWNING,"after all. We need not stop to consider this supposed solution, which"
4737,ROBERT BROWNING,"bristles with contradictions; it would not satisfy Browning himself,"
4738,ROBERT BROWNING,"if he did not back it up with something more to his purpose, something"
4739,ROBERT BROWNING,nearer to warm and transitive feeling. The compensation for our
4740,ROBERT BROWNING,"defeats, the answer to our doubts, is not to be found merely in a proof"
4741,ROBERT BROWNING,of the essential necessity and perfection of the universe; that would
4742,ROBERT BROWNING,"be cold comfort, especially to so uncontemplative a mind. No: that"
4743,ROBERT BROWNING,"answer, and compensation are to come very soon and very vividly to"
4744,ROBERT BROWNING,"every private bosom. There is another life, a series of other lives,"
4745,ROBERT BROWNING,"for this to happen in. Death will come, and--"
4746,ROBERT BROWNING,
4747,ROBERT BROWNING,"""I shall thereupon"
4748,ROBERT BROWNING,"Take rest, ere I be gone"
4749,ROBERT BROWNING,"Once more on my adventure brave and new,"
4750,ROBERT BROWNING,"Fearless and unperplexed,"
4751,ROBERT BROWNING,"When I wage battle next,"
4752,ROBERT BROWNING,"What weapons to select, what armour to endue."""
4753,ROBERT BROWNING,
4754,ROBERT BROWNING,"""For sudden the worst turns the best to the brave,"
4755,ROBERT BROWNING,"The black minute's at end,"
4756,ROBERT BROWNING,"And the element's rage, the fiend-voices that rave"
4757,ROBERT BROWNING,"Shall dwindle, shall blend,"
4758,ROBERT BROWNING,"Shall change, shall become first a peace out of pain,"
4759,ROBERT BROWNING,"Then a light, then thy breast,"
4760,ROBERT BROWNING,O thou soul of my soul! I shall clasp thee again
4761,ROBERT BROWNING,"And with God be the rest!"""
4762,ROBERT BROWNING,
4763,ROBERT BROWNING,"Into this conception of continued life Browning has put, as a"
4764,ROBERT BROWNING,"collection of further passages might easily show, all the items"
4765,ROBERT BROWNING,furnished by fancy or tradition which at the moment satisfied his
4766,ROBERT BROWNING,"imagination--new adventures, reunion with friends, and even, after"
4767,ROBERT BROWNING,"a severe strain and for a short while, a little peace and quiet. The"
4768,ROBERT BROWNING,"gist of the matter is that we are to live indefinitely, that all our"
4769,ROBERT BROWNING,"faults can be turned to good, all our unfinished business settled, and"
4770,ROBERT BROWNING,that therefore there is time for anything we like in this world and
4771,ROBERT BROWNING,for all we need in the other. It is in spirit the direct opposite of
4772,ROBERT BROWNING,"the philosophic maxim of regarding the end, of taking care to leave a"
4773,ROBERT BROWNING,"finished life and a perfect character behind us. It is the opposite,"
4774,ROBERT BROWNING,"also, of the religious _memento mori,_ of the warning that the time"
4775,ROBERT BROWNING,"is short before we go to our account. According to Browning, there"
4776,ROBERT BROWNING,is no account: we have an infinite credit. With an unconscious and
4777,ROBERT BROWNING,"characteristic mixture of heathen instinct with Christian doctrine, he"
4778,ROBERT BROWNING,"thinks of the other world as heaven, but of the life to be led there as"
4779,ROBERT BROWNING,of the life of Nature.
4780,ROBERT BROWNING,
4781,ROBERT BROWNING,Aristotle observes that we do not think the business of life worthy
4782,ROBERT BROWNING,"of the gods, to whom we can only attribute contemplation; if Browning"
4783,ROBERT BROWNING,had had the idea of perfecting and rationalizing this life rather than
4784,ROBERT BROWNING,"of continuing it indefinitely, he would have followed Aristotle and"
4785,ROBERT BROWNING,the Church in this matter. But he had no idea of anything eternal; and
4786,ROBERT BROWNING,"so he gave, as he would probably have said,' a filling to the empty"
4787,ROBERT BROWNING,Christian immortality by making every man busy in it about many things.
4788,ROBERT BROWNING,"And to the irrational man, to the boy, it is no unpleasant idea to"
4789,ROBERT BROWNING,"have an infinite number of days to live through, an infinite number of"
4790,ROBERT BROWNING,"dinners to eat, with an infinity of fresh fights and new love-affairs,"
4791,ROBERT BROWNING,and no end of last rides together.
4792,ROBERT BROWNING,
4793,ROBERT BROWNING,But it is a mere euphemism to call this perpetual vagrancy a
4794,ROBERT BROWNING,development of the soul. A development means the unfolding of a
4795,ROBERT BROWNING,"definite nature, the gradual manifestation of a known idea. A"
4796,ROBERT BROWNING,"series of phases, like the successive leaps of a water-fall, is no"
4797,ROBERT BROWNING,development. And Browning has no idea of an intelligible good which the
4798,ROBERT BROWNING,phases of life might approach and with reference to which they might
4799,ROBERT BROWNING,"constitute a progress. His notion is simply that the game of life, the"
4800,ROBERT BROWNING,"exhilaration of action, is inexhaustible. You may set up your tenpins"
4801,ROBERT BROWNING,"again after you have bowled them over, and you may keep up the sport"
4802,ROBERT BROWNING,for ever. The point is to bring them down as often as possible with
4803,ROBERT BROWNING,a master-stroke and a big bang. That will tend to invigorate in you
4804,ROBERT BROWNING,that self-confidence which in this system passes for faith. But it is
4805,ROBERT BROWNING,"unmeaning to call such an exercise heaven, or to talk of being ""with"
4806,ROBERT BROWNING,"God"" in such a life, in any sense in which we are not with God already"
4807,ROBERT BROWNING,"and under all circumstances. Our destiny would rather be, as Browning"
4808,ROBERT BROWNING,himself expresses it in a phrase which Attila or Alaric might have
4809,ROBERT BROWNING,"composed, ""bound dizzily to the wheel of change to slake the thirst of"
4810,ROBERT BROWNING,"God."""
4811,ROBERT BROWNING,
4812,ROBERT BROWNING,Such an optimism and such a doctrine of immortality can give no
4813,ROBERT BROWNING,justification to experience which it does not already have in its
4814,ROBERT BROWNING,"detached parts. Indeed, those dogmas are not the basis of Browning's"
4815,ROBERT BROWNING,"attitude, not conditions of his satisfaction in living, but rather"
4816,ROBERT BROWNING,overflowings of that satisfaction. The present life is presumably a
4817,ROBERT BROWNING,"fair average of the whole series of ""adventures brave and new"" which"
4818,ROBERT BROWNING,"fall to each man's share; were it not found delightful in itself, there"
4819,ROBERT BROWNING,would be no motive for imagining and asserting that it is reproduced
4820,ROBERT BROWNING,_in infinitum_. So too if we did not think that the evil in experience
4821,ROBERT BROWNING,"is actually utilized and visibly swallowed up in its good effects, we"
4822,ROBERT BROWNING,should hardly venture to think that God could have regarded as a good
4823,ROBERT BROWNING,something which has evil for its condition and which is for that reason
4824,ROBERT BROWNING,profoundly sad and equivocal. But Browning's philosophy of life and
4825,ROBERT BROWNING,habit of imagination do not require the support of any metaphysical
4826,ROBERT BROWNING,theory. His temperament is perfectly self-sufficient and primary; what
4827,ROBERT BROWNING,doctrines he has are suggested by it and are too loose to give it more
4828,ROBERT BROWNING,than a hesitant expression; they are quite powerless to give it any
4829,ROBERT BROWNING,justification which it might lack on its face.
4830,ROBERT BROWNING,
4831,ROBERT BROWNING,"It is the temperament, then, that speaks; we may brush aside as"
4832,ROBERT BROWNING,"unsubstantial, and even as distorting, the web of arguments and"
4833,ROBERT BROWNING,theories which it has spun out of itself. And what does the temperament
4834,ROBERT BROWNING,"say? That life is an adventure, not a discipline; that the exercise"
4835,ROBERT BROWNING,"of energy is the absolute good, irrespective of motives or of"
4836,ROBERT BROWNING,consequences. These are the maxims of a frank barbarism; nothing could
4837,ROBERT BROWNING,"express better the lust of life, the dogged unwillingness to learn"
4838,ROBERT BROWNING,"from experience, the contempt for rationality, the carelessness about"
4839,ROBERT BROWNING,"perfection, the admiration for mere force, in which barbarism always"
4840,ROBERT BROWNING,betrays itself. The vague religion which seeks to justify this attitude
4841,ROBERT BROWNING,is really only another outburst of the same irrational impulse.
4842,ROBERT BROWNING,
4843,ROBERT BROWNING,"In Browning this religion takes the name of Christianity, and"
4844,ROBERT BROWNING,identifies itself with one or two Christian ideas arbitrarily selected;
4845,ROBERT BROWNING,but at heart it has far more affinity to the worship of Thor or of
4846,ROBERT BROWNING,Odin than to the religion of the Cross. The zest of life becomes
4847,ROBERT BROWNING,"a cosmic emotion; we lump the whole together and cry, ""Hurrah for"
4848,ROBERT BROWNING,"the Universe!"" A faith which is thus a pure matter of lustiness and"
4849,ROBERT BROWNING,"inebriation rises and falls, attracts or repels, with the ebb and flow"
4850,ROBERT BROWNING,of the mood from which it springs. It is invincible because unseizable;
4851,ROBERT BROWNING,it is as safe from refutation as it is rebellious to embodiment. But
4852,ROBERT BROWNING,it cannot enlighten or correct the passions on which it feeds. Like
4853,ROBERT BROWNING,"a servile priest, it flatters them in the name of Heaven. It cloaks"
4854,ROBERT BROWNING,"irrationality in sanctimony; and its admiration for every bluff folly,"
4855,ROBERT BROWNING,"being thus justified by a theory, becomes a positive fanaticism, eager"
4856,ROBERT BROWNING,to defend any wayward impulse.
4857,ROBERT BROWNING,
4858,ROBERT BROWNING,"Such barbarism of temper and thought could hardly, in a man of"
4859,ROBERT BROWNING,"Browning's independence and spontaneity, be without its counterpart in"
4860,ROBERT BROWNING,"his art. When a man's personal religion is passive, as Shakespeare's"
4861,ROBERT BROWNING,"seems to have been, and is adopted without question or particular"
4862,ROBERT BROWNING,"interest from the society around him, we may not observe any analogy"
4863,ROBERT BROWNING,between it and the free creations of that man's mind. Not so when the
4864,ROBERT BROWNING,religion is created afresh by the private imagination; it is then
4865,ROBERT BROWNING,"merely one among many personal works of art, and will naturally bear a"
4866,ROBERT BROWNING,"family likeness to the others. The same individual temperament, with"
4867,ROBERT BROWNING,"its limitations and its bias, will appear in the art which has appeared"
4868,ROBERT BROWNING,in the religion. And such is the case with Browning. His limitations
4869,ROBERT BROWNING,as a poet are the counterpart of his limitations as a moralist and
4870,ROBERT BROWNING,theologian; only in the poet they are not so regrettable. Philosophy
4871,ROBERT BROWNING,and religion are nothing if not ultimate; it is their business to deal
4872,ROBERT BROWNING,with general principles and final aims. Now it is in the conception of
4873,ROBERT BROWNING,things fundamental and ultimate that Browning is weak; he is strong
4874,ROBERT BROWNING,"in the conception of things immediate. The pulse of the emotion, the"
4875,ROBERT BROWNING,"bobbing up of the thought, the streaming of the reverie--these he can"
4876,ROBERT BROWNING,note down with picturesque force or imagine with admirable fecundity.
4877,ROBERT BROWNING,
4878,ROBERT BROWNING,"Yet the limits of such excellence are narrow, for no man can safely go"
4879,ROBERT BROWNING,far without the guidance of reason. His long poems have no structure
4880,ROBERT BROWNING,--for that name cannot be given to the singular mechanical division of
4881,ROBERT BROWNING,"""The Ring and the Book."" Even his short poems have no completeness,"
4882,ROBERT BROWNING,no limpidity. They are little torsos made broken so as to stimulate
4883,ROBERT BROWNING,the reader to the restoration of their missing legs and arms. What is
4884,ROBERT BROWNING,"admirable in them is pregnancy of phrase, vividness of passion and"
4885,ROBERT BROWNING,"sentiment, heaped-up scraps of observation, occasional flashes of"
4886,ROBERT BROWNING,"light, occasional beauties of versification,--all like"
4887,ROBERT BROWNING,
4888,ROBERT BROWNING,"""the quick sharp scratch"
4889,ROBERT BROWNING,"And blue spurt of a lighted match."""
4890,ROBERT BROWNING,
4891,ROBERT BROWNING,"There is never anything largely composed in the spirit of pure beauty,"
4892,ROBERT BROWNING,"nothing devotedly finished, nothing simple and truly just. The poet's"
4893,ROBERT BROWNING,mind cannot reach equilibrium; at best he oscillates between opposed
4894,ROBERT BROWNING,"extravagances; his final word is still a _boutade_, still an explosion."
4895,ROBERT BROWNING,He has no sustained nobility of style. He affects with the reader a
4896,ROBERT BROWNING,"confidential and vulgar manner, so as to be more sincere and to feel"
4897,ROBERT BROWNING,more at home. Even in the poems where the effort at impersonality is
4898,ROBERT BROWNING,"most successful, the dramatic disguise is usually thrown off in a"
4899,ROBERT BROWNING,"preface, epilogue or parenthesis. The author likes to remind us of"
4900,ROBERT BROWNING,"himself by some confidential wink or genial poke in the ribs, by some"
4901,ROBERT BROWNING,little interlarded sneer. We get in these tricks of manner a taste of
4902,ROBERT BROWNING,"that essential vulgarity, that indifference to purity and distinction,"
4903,ROBERT BROWNING,which is latent but pervasive in all the products of this mind. The
4904,ROBERT BROWNING,same disdain of perfection which appears in his ethics appears here in
4905,ROBERT BROWNING,"his verse, and impairs its beauty by allowing it to remain too often"
4906,ROBERT BROWNING,"obscure, affected, and grotesque."
4907,ROBERT BROWNING,
4908,ROBERT BROWNING,Such a correspondence is natural: for the same powers of conception
4909,ROBERT BROWNING,"and expression are needed in fiction, which, if turned to reflection,"
4910,ROBERT BROWNING,would produce a good philosophy. Reason is necessary to the perception
4911,ROBERT BROWNING,of high beauty. Discipline is indispensable to art. Work from which
4912,ROBERT BROWNING,these qualities are absent must be barbaric; it can have no ideal form
4913,ROBERT BROWNING,and must appeal to us only through the sensuousness and profusion of
4914,ROBERT BROWNING,its materials. We are invited by it to lapse into a miscellaneous
4915,ROBERT BROWNING,"appreciativeness, into a subservience to every detached impression. And"
4916,ROBERT BROWNING,"yet, if we would only reflect even on these disordered beauties, we"
4917,ROBERT BROWNING,should see that the principle by which they delight us is a principle
4918,ROBERT BROWNING,"by which an ideal, an image of perfection, is inevitably evoked. We"
4919,ROBERT BROWNING,"can have no pleasure or pain, nor any preference whatsoever, without"
4920,ROBERT BROWNING,"implicitly setting up a standard of excellence, an ideal of what"
4921,ROBERT BROWNING,"would satisfy us there. To make these implicit ideals explicit, to"
4922,ROBERT BROWNING,"catch their hint, to work out their theme, and express clearly to"
4923,ROBERT BROWNING,ourselves and to the world what they are demanding in the place of the
4924,ROBERT BROWNING,actual--that is the labour of reason and the task of genius. The two
4925,ROBERT BROWNING,cannot be divided. Clarification of ideas and disentanglement of values
4926,ROBERT BROWNING,are as essential to æsthetic activity as to intelligence. A failure of
4927,ROBERT BROWNING,reason is a failure of art and taste.
4928,ROBERT BROWNING,
4929,ROBERT BROWNING,"The limits of Browning's art, like the limits of Whitman's, can"
4930,ROBERT BROWNING,therefore be understood by considering his mental habit. Both poets
4931,ROBERT BROWNING,"had powerful imaginations, but the type of their imaginations was low."
4932,ROBERT BROWNING,In Whitman imagination was limited to marshalling sensations in single
4933,ROBERT BROWNING,file; the embroideries he made around that central line were simple and
4934,ROBERT BROWNING,insignificant. His energy was concentrated on that somewhat animal form
4935,ROBERT BROWNING,"of contemplation, of which, for the rest, he was a great, perhaps an"
4936,ROBERT BROWNING,unequalled master. Browning rose above that level; with him sensation
4937,ROBERT BROWNING,is usually in the background; he is not particularly a poet of the
4938,ROBERT BROWNING,senses or of ocular vision. His favourite subject-matter is rather the
4939,ROBERT BROWNING,stream of thought and feeling in the mind; he is the poet of soliloquy.
4940,ROBERT BROWNING,"Nature and life as they really are, rather than as they may appear to"
4941,ROBERT BROWNING,"the ignorant and passionate participant in them, lie beyond his range."
4942,ROBERT BROWNING,"Even in his best dramas, like ""A Blot in the 'Scutcheon"" or ""Colombe's"
4943,ROBERT BROWNING,"Birthday,"" the interest remains in the experience of the several"
4944,ROBERT BROWNING,"persons as they explain it to us. The same is the case in ""The King and"
4945,ROBERT BROWNING,"the Book,"" the conception of which, in twelve monstrous soliloquies, is"
4946,ROBERT BROWNING,a striking evidence of the poet's predilection for this form.
4947,ROBERT BROWNING,
4948,ROBERT BROWNING,"The method is, to penetrate by sympathy rather than to portray by"
4949,ROBERT BROWNING,intelligence. The most authoritative insight is not the poet's or the
4950,ROBERT BROWNING,"spectator's, aroused and enlightened by the spectacle, but the various"
4951,ROBERT BROWNING,"heroes' own, in their moment of intensest passion. We therefore miss"
4952,ROBERT BROWNING,"the tragic relief and exaltation, and come away instead with the"
4953,ROBERT BROWNING,uncomfortable feeling that an obstinate folly is apparently the most
4954,ROBERT BROWNING,glorious and choiceworthy thing in the world. This is evidently the
4955,ROBERT BROWNING,"poet's own illusion, and those who do not happen to share it must feel"
4956,ROBERT BROWNING,"that if life were really as irrational as he thinks it, it would be"
4957,ROBERT BROWNING,"not only profoundly discouraging, which it often is, but profoundly"
4958,ROBERT BROWNING,"disgusting, which it surely is not; for at least it reveals the ideal"
4959,ROBERT BROWNING,which it fails to attain.
4960,ROBERT BROWNING,
4961,ROBERT BROWNING,This ideal Browning never disentangles. For him the crude experience is
4962,ROBERT BROWNING,"the only end, the endless struggle the only ideal, and the perturbed"
4963,ROBERT BROWNING,"""Soul"" the only organon of truth. The arrest of his intelligence at"
4964,ROBERT BROWNING,"this point, before it has envisaged any rational object, explains the"
4965,ROBERT BROWNING,arrest of his dramatic art at soliloquy. His immersion in the forms of
4966,ROBERT BROWNING,self-consciousness prevents him from dramatizing the real relations
4967,ROBERT BROWNING,"of men and their thinkings to one another, to Nature, and to destiny."
4968,ROBERT BROWNING,For in order to do so he would have had to view his characters from
4969,ROBERT BROWNING,"above (as Cervantes did, for instance), and to see them not merely"
4970,ROBERT BROWNING,"as they appeared to themselves, but as they appear to reason. This"
4971,ROBERT BROWNING,"higher attitude, however, was not only beyond Browning's scope, it"
4972,ROBERT BROWNING,"was positively contrary to his inspiration. Had he reached it, he"
4973,ROBERT BROWNING,"would no longer have seen the universe through the ""Soul,"" but through"
4974,ROBERT BROWNING,"the intellect, and he would not have been able to cry, ""How the"
4975,ROBERT BROWNING,"world is made for each one of us!"" On the contrary, the ""Soul"" would"
4976,ROBERT BROWNING,"have figured only in its true conditions, in all its ignorance and"
4977,ROBERT BROWNING,"dependence, and also in its essential teachableness, a point against"
4978,ROBERT BROWNING,which Browning's barbaric wilfulness particularly rebelled. Booted
4979,ROBERT BROWNING,in his persuasion that the soul is essentially omnipotent and that
4980,ROBERT BROWNING,"to live hard can never be to live wrong, he remained fascinated by"
4981,ROBERT BROWNING,"the march and method of self-consciousness, and never allowed himself"
4982,ROBERT BROWNING,to be weaned from that romantic fatuity by the energy of rational
4983,ROBERT BROWNING,"imagination, which prompts us not to regard our ideas as mere filling"
4984,ROBERT BROWNING,"of a dream, but rather to build on them the conception of permanent"
4985,ROBERT BROWNING,"objects and overruling principles, such as Nature, society, and the"
4986,ROBERT BROWNING,other ideals of reason. A full-grown imagination deals with these
4987,ROBERT BROWNING,"things, which do not obey the laws of psychological progression, and"
4988,ROBERT BROWNING,cannot be described by the methods of soliloquy.
4989,ROBERT BROWNING,
4990,ROBERT BROWNING,"We thus see that Browning's sphere, though more subtle and complex"
4991,ROBERT BROWNING,"than Whitman's, was still elementary. It lay far below the spheres of"
4992,ROBERT BROWNING,social and historical reality in which Shakespeare moved; far below
4993,ROBERT BROWNING,the comprehensive and cosmic sphere of every great epic poet. Browning
4994,ROBERT BROWNING,did not even reach the intellectual plane of such contemporary poets
4995,ROBERT BROWNING,"as Tennyson and Matthew Arnold, who, whatever may be thought of their"
4996,ROBERT BROWNING,"powers, did not study consciousness for itself, but for the sake of"
4997,ROBERT BROWNING,its meaning and of the objects which it revealed. The best things that
4998,ROBERT BROWNING,come into a man's consciousness are the things that take him out of
4999,ROBERT BROWNING,it--the rational things that are independent of his personal perception
5000,ROBERT BROWNING,"and of his personal existence. These he approaches with his reason,"
5001,ROBERT BROWNING,"and they, in the same measure, endow him with their immortality. But"
5002,ROBERT BROWNING,precisely these things--the objects of science and of the constructive
5003,ROBERT BROWNING,"imagination--Browning always saw askance, in the out-skirts of his"
5004,ROBERT BROWNING,"field of vision, for his eye was fixed and riveted on the soliloquizing"
5005,ROBERT BROWNING,"Soul. And this Soul being, to his apprehension, irrational, did not"
5006,ROBERT BROWNING,give itself over to those permanent objects which might otherwise have
5007,ROBERT BROWNING,"occupied it, but ruminated on its own accidental emotions, on its"
5008,ROBERT BROWNING,"love-affairs, and on its hopes of going on so ruminating for ever."
5009,ROBERT BROWNING,
5010,ROBERT BROWNING,"The pathology of the human mind--for the normal, too, is pathological"
5011,ROBERT BROWNING,when it is not referred to the ideal--the pathology of the human
5012,ROBERT BROWNING,"mind is a very interesting subject, demanding great gifts and great"
5013,ROBERT BROWNING,"ingenuity in its treatment. Browning ministers to this interest, and"
5014,ROBERT BROWNING,possesses this ingenuity and these gifts. More than any other poet he
5015,ROBERT BROWNING,"keeps a kind of speculation alive in the now large body of sentimental,"
5016,ROBERT BROWNING,"eager-minded people, who no longer can find in a definite religion a"
5017,ROBERT BROWNING,form and language for their imaginative life. That this service is
5018,ROBERT BROWNING,greatly appreciated speaks well for the ineradicable tendency in man to
5019,ROBERT BROWNING,study himself and his destiny. We do not deny the achievement when we
5020,ROBERT BROWNING,point out its nature and limitations. It does not cease to be something
5021,ROBERT BROWNING,because it is taken to be more than it is.
5022,ROBERT BROWNING,
5023,ROBERT BROWNING,In every imaginative sphere the nineteenth century has been an era
5024,ROBERT BROWNING,"of chaos, as it has been an era of order and growing organization in"
5025,ROBERT BROWNING,the spheres of science and of industry. An ancient doctrine of the
5026,ROBERT BROWNING,philosophers asserts that to chaos the world must ultimately return.
5027,ROBERT BROWNING,And what is perhaps true of the cycles of cosmic change is certainly
5028,ROBERT BROWNING,"true of the revolutions of culture. Nothing lasts for ever: languages,"
5029,ROBERT BROWNING,"arts, and religions disintegrate with time. Yet the perfecting of such"
5030,ROBERT BROWNING,forms is the only criterion of progress; the destruction of them the
5031,ROBERT BROWNING,"chief evidence of decay. Perhaps fate intends that we should have, in"
5032,ROBERT BROWNING,"our imaginative decadence, the consolation of fancying that we are"
5033,ROBERT BROWNING,"still progressing, and that the disintegration of religion and the"
5034,ROBERT BROWNING,arts is bringing us nearer to the protoplasm of sensation and passion.
5035,ROBERT BROWNING,"If energy and actuality are all that we care for, chaos is as good as"
5036,ROBERT BROWNING,"order, and barbarism as good as discipline--better, perhaps, since"
5037,ROBERT BROWNING,impulse is not then restrained within any bounds of reason or beauty.
5038,ROBERT BROWNING,But if the powers of the human mind are at any time adequate to the
5039,ROBERT BROWNING,"task of digesting experience, clearness and order inevitably supervene."
5040,ROBERT BROWNING,"The moulds of thought are imposed upon Nature, and the conviction of a"
5041,ROBERT BROWNING,definite truth arises together with the vision of a supreme perfection.
5042,ROBERT BROWNING,It is only at such periods that the human animal vindicates his title
5043,ROBERT BROWNING,"of rational. If such an epoch should return, people will no doubt"
5044,ROBERT BROWNING,retrace our present gropings with interest and see in them gradual
5045,ROBERT BROWNING,approaches to their own achievement. Whitman and Browning might well
5046,ROBERT BROWNING,figure then as representatives of our time. For the merit of being
5047,ROBERT BROWNING,"representative cannot be denied them. The mind of our age, like theirs,"
5048,ROBERT BROWNING,"is choked with materials, emotional, and inconclusive. They merely"
5049,ROBERT BROWNING,"aggravate our characteristics, and their success with us is due partly"
5050,ROBERT BROWNING,to their own absolute strength and partly to our common weakness. If
5051,ROBERT BROWNING,"once, however, this imaginative weakness could be overcome, and a form"
5052,ROBERT BROWNING,"found for the crude matter of experience, men might look back from the"
5053,ROBERT BROWNING,height of a new religion and a new poetry upon the present troubles of
5054,ROBERT BROWNING,the spirit; and perhaps even these things might then be pleasant to
5055,ROBERT BROWNING,remember.

5064,EMERSON,
5065,EMERSON,
5066,EMERSON,"Those who knew Emerson, or who stood so near to his time and to his"
5067,EMERSON,"circle that they caught some echo of his personal influence, did"
5068,EMERSON,"not judge him merely as a poet or philosopher, nor identify his"
5069,EMERSON,"efficacy with that of his writings. His friends and neighbours, the"
5070,EMERSON,"congregations he preached to in his younger days, the audiences that"
5071,EMERSON,"afterward listened to his lectures, all agreed in a veneration for his"
5072,EMERSON,person which had nothing to do with their understanding or acceptance
5073,EMERSON,"of his opinions. They flocked to him and listened to his word, not"
5074,EMERSON,so much for the sake of its absolute meaning as for the atmosphere
5075,EMERSON,"of candour, purity, and serenity that hung about it, as about a sort"
5076,EMERSON,of sacred music. They felt themselves in the presence of a rare and
5077,EMERSON,"beautiful spirit, who was in communion with a higher world. More than"
5078,EMERSON,"the truth his teaching might express, they valued the sense it gave"
5079,EMERSON,"them of a truth that was inexpressible. They became aware, if we may"
5080,EMERSON,"say so, of the ultra-violet rays of his spectrum, of the inaudible"
5081,EMERSON,"highest notes of his gamut, too pure and thin for common ears."
5082,EMERSON,
5083,EMERSON,This effect was by no means due to the possession on the part of
5084,EMERSON,"Emerson of the secret of the universe, or even of a definite conception"
5085,EMERSON,of ultimate truth. He was not a prophet who had once for all climbed
5086,EMERSON,"his Sinai or his Tabor, and having there beheld the transfigured"
5087,EMERSON,"reality, descended again to make authoritative report of it to the"
5088,EMERSON,world. Far from it. At bottom he had no doctrine at all. The deeper he
5089,EMERSON,"went and the more he tried to grapple with fundamental conceptions,"
5090,EMERSON,the vaguer and more elusive they became in his hands. Did he know what
5091,EMERSON,"he meant by Spirit or the ""Over-Soul""? Could he say what he understood"
5092,EMERSON,"by the terms, so constantly on his lips, Nature, Law, God, Benefit, or"
5093,EMERSON,"Beauty? He could not, and the consciousness of that incapacity was so"
5094,EMERSON,lively within him that he never attempted to give articulation to his
5095,EMERSON,philosophy. His finer instinct kept him from doing that violence to his
5096,EMERSON,inspiration.
5097,EMERSON,
5098,EMERSON,"The source of his power lay not in his doctrine, but in his"
5099,EMERSON,"temperament, and the rare quality of his wisdom was due less to his"
5100,EMERSON,reason than to his imagination. Reality eluded him; he had neither
5101,EMERSON,diligence nor constancy enough to master and possess it; but his mind
5102,EMERSON,"was open to all philosophic influences, from whatever quarter they"
5103,EMERSON,might blow; the lessons of science and the hints of poetry worked
5104,EMERSON,themselves out in him to a free and personal religion. He differed from
5105,EMERSON,"the plodding many, not in knowing things better, but in having more"
5106,EMERSON,"ways of knowing them. His grasp was not particularly firm, he was far"
5107,EMERSON,"from being, like a Plato or an Aristotle, past master in the art and"
5108,EMERSON,"the science of life. But his mind was endowed with unusual plasticity,"
5109,EMERSON,with unusual spontaneity and liberty of movement--it was a fairyland
5110,EMERSON,of thoughts and fancies. He was like a young god making experiments in
5111,EMERSON,"creation: he blotched the work, and always began again on a new and"
5112,EMERSON,"better plan. Every day he said, ""Let there be light,"" and every day the"
5113,EMERSON,"light was new. His sun, like that of Heraclitus, was different every"
5114,EMERSON,morning.
5115,EMERSON,
5116,EMERSON,"What seemed, then, to the more earnest and less critical of his"
5117,EMERSON,hearers a revelation from above was in truth rather an insurrection
5118,EMERSON,"from beneath, a shaking loose from convention, a disintegration of"
5119,EMERSON,the normal categories of reason in favour of various imaginative
5120,EMERSON,"principles, on which the world might have been built, if it had been"
5121,EMERSON,built differently. This gift of revolutionary thinking allowed new
5122,EMERSON,"aspects, hints of wider laws, premonitions of unthought of fundamental"
5123,EMERSON,unities to spring constantly into view. But such visions were
5124,EMERSON,"necessarily fleeting, because the human mind had long before settled"
5125,EMERSON,"its grammar, and discovered, after much groping and many defeats, the"
5126,EMERSON,general forms in which experience will allow itself to be stated. These
5127,EMERSON,"general forms are the principles of common sense and positive science,"
5128,EMERSON,no less imaginative in their origin than those notions which we now
5129,EMERSON,"call transcendental, but grown prosaic, like the metaphors of common"
5130,EMERSON,"speech, by dint of repetition."
5131,EMERSON,
5132,EMERSON,"Yet authority, even of this rational kind, sat lightly upon Emerson. To"
5133,EMERSON,reject tradition and think as one might have thought if no man had ever
5134,EMERSON,"existed before was indeed the aspiration of the Transcendentalists, and"
5135,EMERSON,"although Emerson hardly regarded himself as a member of that school,"
5136,EMERSON,he largely shared its tendency and passed for its spokesman. Without
5137,EMERSON,"protesting against tradition, he smilingly eluded it in his thoughts,"
5138,EMERSON,untamable in their quiet irresponsibility. He fled to his woods or
5139,EMERSON,"to his ""pleached garden,"" to be the creator of his own worlds in"
5140,EMERSON,solitude and freedom. No wonder that he brought thence to the tightly
5141,EMERSON,conventional minds of his contemporaries a breath as if from paradise.
5142,EMERSON,"His simplicity in novelty, his profundity, his ingenuous ardour must"
5143,EMERSON,"have seemed to them something heavenly, and they may be excused if they"
5144,EMERSON,thought they detected inspiration even in his occasional thin paradoxes
5145,EMERSON,and guileless whims. They were stifled with conscience and he brought
5146,EMERSON,them a breath of Nature; they were surfeited with shallow controversies
5147,EMERSON,and he gave them poetic truth.
5148,EMERSON,
5149,EMERSON,"Imagination, indeed, is his single theme. As a preacher might under"
5150,EMERSON,"every text enforce the same lessons of the gospel, so Emerson traces"
5151,EMERSON,"in every sphere the same spiritual laws of experience--compensation,"
5152,EMERSON,"continuity, the self-expression of the Soul in the forms of Nature"
5153,EMERSON,"and of society, until she finally recognizes herself in her own work"
5154,EMERSON,and sees its beneficence and beauty. His constant refrain is the
5155,EMERSON,"omnipotence of imaginative thought; its power first to make the world,"
5156,EMERSON,"then to understand it, and finally to rise above it. All Nature is"
5157,EMERSON,"an embodiment of our native fancy, all history a drama in which the"
5158,EMERSON,innate possibilities of the spirit are enacted and realized. While
5159,EMERSON,the conflict of life and the shocks of experience seem to bring us
5160,EMERSON,"face to face with an alien and overwhelming power, reflection can"
5161,EMERSON,humanize and rationalize that power by conceiving its laws; and with
5162,EMERSON,this recognition of the rationality of all things comes the sense of
5163,EMERSON,their beauty and order. The destruction which Nature seems to prepare
5164,EMERSON,for our special hopes is thus seen to be the victory of our impersonal
5165,EMERSON,"interests. To awaken in us this spiritual insight, an elevation of mind"
5166,EMERSON,"which is at once an act of comprehension and of worship, to substitute"
5167,EMERSON,it for lower passions and more servile forms of intelligence--that
5168,EMERSON,"is Emerson's constant effort. All his resources of illustration,"
5169,EMERSON,"observation, and rhetoric are used to deepen and clarify this sort of"
5170,EMERSON,wisdom.
5171,EMERSON,
5172,EMERSON,Such thought is essentially the same that is found in the German
5173,EMERSON,"romantic or idealistic philosophers, with whom Emerson's affinity"
5174,EMERSON,"is remarkable, all the more as he seems to have borrowed little"
5175,EMERSON,"or nothing from their works. The critics of human nature, in the"
5176,EMERSON,"eighteenth century, had shown how much men's ideas depend on their"
5177,EMERSON,"predispositions, on the character of their senses and the habits of"
5178,EMERSON,"their intelligence. Seizing upon this thought and exaggerating it, the"
5179,EMERSON,romantic philosophers attributed to the spirit of man the omnipotence
5180,EMERSON,"which had belonged to God, and felt that in this way they were"
5181,EMERSON,reasserting the supremacy of mind over matter and establishing it upon
5182,EMERSON,a safe and rational basis.
5183,EMERSON,
5184,EMERSON,"The Germans were great system-makers, and Emerson cannot rival them in"
5185,EMERSON,the sustained effort of thought by which they sought to reinterpret
5186,EMERSON,every sphere of being according to their chosen principles. But he
5187,EMERSON,surpassed them in an instinctive sense of what he was doing. He never
5188,EMERSON,"represented his poetry as science, nor countenanced the formation of"
5189,EMERSON,a new sect that should nurse the sense of a private and mysterious
5190,EMERSON,"illumination, and relight the fagots of passion and prejudice. He"
5191,EMERSON,never tried to seek out and defend the universal implications of his
5192,EMERSON,"ideas, and never wrote the book he had once planned on the law of"
5193,EMERSON,"compensation, foreseeing, we may well believe, the sophistries in which"
5194,EMERSON,he would have been directly involved. He fortunately preferred a fresh
5195,EMERSON,"statement on a fresh subject. A suggestion once given, the spirit once"
5196,EMERSON,"aroused to speculation, a glimpse once gained of some ideal harmony,"
5197,EMERSON,he chose to descend again to common sense and to touch the earth for a
5198,EMERSON,moment before another flight. The faculty of idealization was itself
5199,EMERSON,what he valued. Philosophy for him was rather a moral energy flowering
5200,EMERSON,into sprightliness of thought than a body of serious and defensible
5201,EMERSON,doctrines. In practising transcendental speculation only in this poetic
5202,EMERSON,"and sporadic fashion, Emerson retained its true value and avoided its"
5203,EMERSON,greatest danger. He secured the freedom and fertility of his thought
5204,EMERSON,and did not allow one conception of law or one hint of harmony to
5205,EMERSON,sterilize the mind and prevent the subsequent birth within it of other
5206,EMERSON,"ideas, no less just and imposing than their predecessors. For we are"
5207,EMERSON,not dealing at all in such a philosophy with matters of fact or with
5208,EMERSON,such verifiable truths as exclude their opposites. We are dealing only
5209,EMERSON,"with imagination, with the art of conception, and with the various"
5210,EMERSON,"forms in which reflection, like a poet, may compose and recompose human"
5211,EMERSON,experience.
5212,EMERSON,
5213,EMERSON,"A certain disquiet mingled, however, in the minds of Emerson's"
5214,EMERSON,contemporaries with the admiration they felt for his purity and
5215,EMERSON,genius. They saw that he had forsaken the doctrines of the Church; and
5216,EMERSON,they were not sure whether he held quite unequivocally any doctrine
5217,EMERSON,whatever. We may not all of us share the concern for orthodoxy which
5218,EMERSON,usually caused this puzzled alarm: we may understand that it was not
5219,EMERSON,Emerson's vocation to be definite and dogmatic in religion any more
5220,EMERSON,"than in philosophy. Yet that disquiet will not, even for us, wholly"
5221,EMERSON,disappear. It is produced by a defect which naturally accompanies
5222,EMERSON,imagination in all but the greatest minds. I mean disorganization.
5223,EMERSON,"Emerson not only conceived things in new ways, but he seemed to think"
5224,EMERSON,the new ways might cancel and supersede the old. His imagination was
5225,EMERSON,to invalidate the understanding. That inspiration which should come
5226,EMERSON,to fulfil seemed too often to come to destroy. If he was able so
5227,EMERSON,"constantly to stimulate us to fresh thoughts, was it not because he"
5228,EMERSON,demolished the labour of long ages of reflection? Was not the startling
5229,EMERSON,effect of much of his writing due to its contradiction to tradition and
5230,EMERSON,to common sense?
5231,EMERSON,
5232,EMERSON,"So long as he is a poet and in the enjoyment of his poetic license, we"
5233,EMERSON,can blame this play of mind only by a misunderstanding. It is possible
5234,EMERSON,to think otherwise than as common sense thinks; there are other
5235,EMERSON,categories beside those of science. When we employ them we enlarge
5236,EMERSON,our lives. We add to the world of fact any number of worlds of the
5237,EMERSON,imagination in which human nature and the eternal relations of ideas
5238,EMERSON,may be nobly expressed. So far our imaginative fertility is only a
5239,EMERSON,benefit: it surrounds us with the congenial and necessary radiation
5240,EMERSON,of art and religion. It manifests our moral vitality in the bosom of
5241,EMERSON,Nature.
5242,EMERSON,
5243,EMERSON,But sometimes imagination invades the sphere of understanding and seems
5244,EMERSON,"to discredit its indispensable work. Common sense, we are allowed to"
5245,EMERSON,"infer, is a shallow affair: true insight changes all that. When so"
5246,EMERSON,"applied, poetic activity is not an unmixed good. It loosens our hold on"
5247,EMERSON,"fact and confuses our intelligence, so that we forget that intelligence"
5248,EMERSON,"has itself every prerogative of imagination, and has besides the"
5249,EMERSON,sanction of practical validity. We are made to believe that since the
5250,EMERSON,"understanding is something human and conditioned, something which might"
5251,EMERSON,"have been different, as the senses might have been different, and"
5252,EMERSON,"which we may yet, so to speak, get behind--therefore the understanding"
5253,EMERSON,"ought to be abandoned. We long for higher faculties, neglecting those"
5254,EMERSON,"we have, we yearn for intuition, closing our eyes upon experience. We"
5255,EMERSON,become mystical.
5256,EMERSON,
5257,EMERSON,"Mysticism, as we have said, is the surrender of a category of thought"
5258,EMERSON,"because we divine its relativity. As every new category, however, must"
5259,EMERSON,"share this reproach, the mystic is obliged in the end to give them all"
5260,EMERSON,"up, the poetic and moral categories no less than the physical, so that"
5261,EMERSON,"the end of his purification is the atrophy of his whole nature, the"
5262,EMERSON,"emptying of his whole heart and mind to make room, as he thinks, for"
5263,EMERSON,God. By attacking the authority of the understanding as the organon
5264,EMERSON,"of knowledge, by substituting itself for it as the herald of a deeper"
5265,EMERSON,"truth, the imagination thus prepares its own destruction. For if the"
5266,EMERSON,"understanding is rejected because it cannot grasp the absolute, the"
5267,EMERSON,"imagination and all its works--art, dogma, worship--must presently be"
5268,EMERSON,rejected for the same reason. Common sense and poetry must both go by
5269,EMERSON,"the board, and conscience must follow after: for all these are human"
5270,EMERSON,"and relative. Mysticism will be satisfied only with the absolute, and"
5271,EMERSON,"as the absolute, by its very definition, is not representable by any"
5272,EMERSON,"specific faculty, it must be approached through the abandonment of all."
5273,EMERSON,The lights of life must be extinguished that the light of the absolute
5274,EMERSON,"may shine, and the possession of everything in general must be secured"
5275,EMERSON,by the surrender of everything in particular.
5276,EMERSON,
5277,EMERSON,"The same diffidence, however, the same constant renewal of sincerity"
5278,EMERSON,"which kept Emerson's flights of imagination near to experience, kept"
5279,EMERSON,his mysticism also within bounds. A certain mystical tendency is
5280,EMERSON,"pervasive with him, but there are only one or two subjects on which"
5281,EMERSON,he dwells with enough constancy and energy of attention to make his
5282,EMERSON,mystical treatment of them pronounced. One of these is the question
5283,EMERSON,"of the unity of all minds in the single soul of the universe, which"
5284,EMERSON,is the same in all creatures; another is the question of evil and
5285,EMERSON,of its evaporation in the universal harmony of things. Both these
5286,EMERSON,"ideas suggest themselves at certain turns in every man's experience,"
5287,EMERSON,and might receive a rational formulation. But they are intricate
5288,EMERSON,"subjects, obscured by many emotional prejudices, so that the labour,"
5289,EMERSON,"impartiality, and precision which would be needed to elucidate them are"
5290,EMERSON,"to be looked for in scholastic rather than in inspired thinkers, and in"
5291,EMERSON,Emerson least of all. Before these problems he is alternately ingenuous
5292,EMERSON,"and rhapsodical, and in both moods equally helpless. Individuals"
5293,EMERSON,"no doubt exist, he says to himself. But, ah! Napoleon is in every"
5294,EMERSON,schoolboy. In every squatter in the western prairies we shall find an
5295,EMERSON,owner--
5296,EMERSON,
5297,EMERSON,"""Of Caesar's hand and Plato's brain,"
5298,EMERSON,"Of Lord Christ's heart, and Shakespeare's strain."""
5299,EMERSON,
5300,EMERSON,"But how? we may ask. Potentially? Is it because any mind, were it"
5301,EMERSON,"given the right body and the right experience, were it made over, in a"
5302,EMERSON,"word, into another mind, would resemble that other mind to the point"
5303,EMERSON,of identity? Or is it that our souls are already so largely similar
5304,EMERSON,that we are subject to many kindred promptings and share many ideals
5305,EMERSON,unrealizable in our particular circumstances? But then we should simply
5306,EMERSON,"be saying that if what makes men different were removed, men would be"
5307,EMERSON,"indistinguishable, or that, in so far as they are now alike, they can"
5308,EMERSON,understand one another by summoning up their respective experiences
5309,EMERSON,"in the fancy. There would be no mysticism in that, but at the same"
5310,EMERSON,"time, alas, no eloquence, no paradox, and, if we must say the word, no"
5311,EMERSON,nonsense.
5312,EMERSON,
5313,EMERSON,"On the question of evil, Emerson's position is of the same kind. There"
5314,EMERSON,"is evil, of course, he tells us. Experience is sad. There is a crack"
5315,EMERSON,"in everything that God has made. But, ah! the laws of the universe"
5316,EMERSON,are sacred and beneficent. Without them nothing good could arise. All
5317,EMERSON,"things, then, are in their right places and the universe is perfect"
5318,EMERSON,above our querulous tears. Perfect? we may ask. But perfect from what
5319,EMERSON,"point of view, in reference to what ideal? To its own? To that of a"
5320,EMERSON,"man who renouncing himself and all naturally dear to him, ignoring"
5321,EMERSON,"the injustice, suffering, and impotence in the world, allows his will"
5322,EMERSON,and his conscience to be hypnotized by the spectacle of a necessary
5323,EMERSON,"evolution, and lulled into cruelty by the pomp and music of a tragic"
5324,EMERSON,"show? In that case the evil is not explained, it is forgotten; it is"
5325,EMERSON,"not cured, but condoned. We have surrendered the category of the better"
5326,EMERSON,"and the worse, the deepest foundation of life and reason; we have"
5327,EMERSON,"become mystics on the one subject on which, above all others, we ought"
5328,EMERSON,to be men.
5329,EMERSON,
5330,EMERSON,Two forces may be said to have carried Emerson in this mystical
5331,EMERSON,"direction; one, that freedom of his imagination which we have already"
5332,EMERSON,"noted, and which kept him from the fear of self-contradiction; the"
5333,EMERSON,other the habit of worship inherited from his clerical ancestors and
5334,EMERSON,"enforced by his religious education. The spirit of conformity, the"
5335,EMERSON,"unction, the loyalty even unto death inspired by the religion of"
5336,EMERSON,"Jehovah, were dispositions acquired by too long a discipline and rooted"
5337,EMERSON,"in too many forms of speech, of thought, and of worship for a man like"
5338,EMERSON,"Emerson, who had felt their full force, ever to be able to lose them."
5339,EMERSON,The evolutions of his abstract opinions left that habit unchanged.
5340,EMERSON,"Unless we keep this circumstance in mind, we shall not be able to"
5341,EMERSON,"understand the kind of elation and sacred joy, so characteristic of"
5342,EMERSON,"his eloquence, with which he propounds laws of Nature and aspects of"
5343,EMERSON,"experience which, viewed in themselves, afford but an equivocal support"
5344,EMERSON,to moral enthusiasm. An optimism so persistent and unclouded as his
5345,EMERSON,will seem at variance with the description he himself gives of human
5346,EMERSON,"life, a description coloured by a poetic idealism, but hardly by an"
5347,EMERSON,optimistic bias.
5348,EMERSON,
5349,EMERSON,"We must remember, therefore, that this optimism is a pious tradition,"
5350,EMERSON,originally justified by the belief in a personal God and in a
5351,EMERSON,providential government of affairs for the ultimate and positive good
5352,EMERSON,"of the elect, and that the habit of worship survived in Emerson as an"
5353,EMERSON,instinct after those positive beliefs had faded into a recognition
5354,EMERSON,"of ""spiritual laws."" We must remember that Calvinism had known how"
5355,EMERSON,to combine an awestruck devotion to the Supreme Being with no very
5356,EMERSON,"roseate picture of the destinies of mankind, and for more than two"
5357,EMERSON,hundred years had been breeding in the stock from which Emerson came
5358,EMERSON,"a willingness to be, as the phrase is, ""damned for the glory of God."""
5359,EMERSON,"What wonder, then, that when, for the former inexorable dispensation"
5360,EMERSON,"of Providence, Emerson substituted his general spiritual and natural"
5361,EMERSON,"laws, he should not have felt the spirit of worship fail within him?"
5362,EMERSON,"On the contrary, his thought moved in the presence of moral harmonies"
5363,EMERSON,"which seemed to him truer, more beautiful, and more beneficent than"
5364,EMERSON,those of the old theology. An independent philosopher would not have
5365,EMERSON,seen in those harmonies an object of worship or a sufficient basis
5366,EMERSON,"for optimism. But he was not an independent philosopher, in spite"
5367,EMERSON,of his belief in independence. He inherited the problems and the
5368,EMERSON,"preoccupations of the theology from which he started, being in this"
5369,EMERSON,"respect like the German idealists, who, with all their pretence of"
5370,EMERSON,"absolute metaphysics, were in reality only giving elusive and abstract"
5371,EMERSON,"forms to traditional theology. Emerson, too, was not primarily a"
5372,EMERSON,"philosopher, but a Puritan mystic with a poetic fancy and a gift for"
5373,EMERSON,"observation and epigram, and he saw in the laws of Nature, idealized by"
5374,EMERSON,"his imagination, only a more intelligible form of the divinity he had"
5375,EMERSON,always recognized and adored. His was not a philosophy passing into a
5376,EMERSON,"religion, but a religion expressing itself as a philosophy and veiled,"
5377,EMERSON,"as at its setting it descended the heavens, in various tints of poetry"
5378,EMERSON,and science.
5379,EMERSON,
5380,EMERSON,If we ask ourselves what was Emerson's relation to the scientific and
5381,EMERSON,"religious movements of his time, and what place he may claim in the"
5382,EMERSON,"history of opinion, we must answer that he belonged very little to the"
5383,EMERSON,"past, very little to the present, and almost wholly to that abstract"
5384,EMERSON,sphere into which mystical or philosophic aspiration has carried a few
5385,EMERSON,men in all ages. The religious tradition in which he was reared was
5386,EMERSON,"that of Puritanism, but of a Puritanism which, retaining its moral"
5387,EMERSON,"intensity and metaphysical abstraction, had minimized its doctrinal"
5388,EMERSON,expression and become Unitarian. Emerson was indeed the Psyche of
5389,EMERSON,"Puritanism, ""the latest-born and fairest vision far"" of all that ""faded"
5390,EMERSON,"hierarchy."" A Puritan whose religion was all poetry, a poet whose"
5391,EMERSON,"only pleasure was thought, he showed in his life and personality the"
5392,EMERSON,"meagreness, the constraint, the frigid and conscious consecration which"
5393,EMERSON,"belonged to his clerical ancestors, while his inmost impersonal spirit"
5394,EMERSON,"ranged abroad over the fields of history and Nature, gathering what"
5395,EMERSON,"ideas it might, and singing its little snatches of inspired song."
5396,EMERSON,
5397,EMERSON,The traditional element was thus rather an external and unessential
5398,EMERSON,"contribution to Emerson's mind; he had the professional tinge, the"
5399,EMERSON,"decorum, the distinction of an old-fashioned divine; he had also the"
5400,EMERSON,"habit of writing sermons, and he had the national pride and hope of a"
5401,EMERSON,religious people that felt itself providentially chosen to establish a
5402,EMERSON,"free and godly commonwealth in a new world. For the rest, he separated"
5403,EMERSON,himself from the ancient creed of the community with a sense rather of
5404,EMERSON,relief than of regret. A literal belief in Christian doctrines repelled
5405,EMERSON,"him as unspiritual, as manifesting no understanding of the meaning"
5406,EMERSON,"which, as allegories, those doctrines might have to a philosophic and"
5407,EMERSON,poetical spirit. Although as a clergy-man he was at first in the habit
5408,EMERSON,"of referring to the Bible and its lessons as to a supreme authority, he"
5409,EMERSON,had no instinctive sympathy with the inspiration of either the Old or
5410,EMERSON,"the New Testament; in Hafiz or Plutarch, in Plato or Shakespeare, he"
5411,EMERSON,found more congenial stuff.
5412,EMERSON,
5413,EMERSON,"While he thus preferred to withdraw, without rancour and without"
5414,EMERSON,"contempt, from the ancient fellowship of the church, he assumed an"
5415,EMERSON,attitude hardly less cool and deprecatory toward the enthusiasms of the
5416,EMERSON,new era. The national ideal of democracy and freedom had his entire
5417,EMERSON,sympathy; he allowed himself to be drawn into the movement against
5418,EMERSON,slavery; he took a curious and smiling interest in the discoveries of
5419,EMERSON,natural science and in the material progress of the age. But he could
5420,EMERSON,"go no farther. His contemplative nature, his religious training, his"
5421,EMERSON,"dispersed reading, made him stand aside from the life of the world,"
5422,EMERSON,even while he studied it with benevolent attention. His heart was fixed
5423,EMERSON,"on eternal things, and he was in no sense a prophet for his age or"
5424,EMERSON,country. He belonged by nature to that mystical company of devout souls
5425,EMERSON,"that recognize no particular home and are dispersed throughout history,"
5426,EMERSON,although not without intercommunication. He felt his affinity to the
5427,EMERSON,"Hindoos and the Persians, to the Platonists and the Stoics. Like them"
5428,EMERSON,"he remains ""a friend and aider of those who would live in the spirit."""
5429,EMERSON,"If not a star of the first magnitude, he is certainly a fixed star"
5430,EMERSON,"in the firmament of philosophy. Alone as yet among Americans, he may"
5431,EMERSON,"be said to have won a place there, if not by the originality of his"
5432,EMERSON,"thought, at least by the originality and beauty of the expression he"
5433,EMERSON,gave to thoughts that are old and imperishable.

5444,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,_Man has henceforth this cause of pride: that he has bethought
5445,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"himself of justice in a universe without justice, and has put justice"
5446,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,there_.--JEAN LAHOR.
5447,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,
5448,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,
5449,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,The break-up of traditional systems and the disappearance of a
5450,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,recognized authority from the religious world have naturally led to
5451,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,many attempts at philosophic reconstruction. Most of these are timid
5452,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"compromises, which leave first principles untouched and contain in a"
5453,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,veiled form all the old contradictions. Others are advertisements of
5454,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"some personal notion, some fresh discovery, proposed as a panacea and"
5455,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"as an equivalent for all the heritage of human wisdom. A few thinkers,"
5456,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"however, inspired by more comprehensive sympathies, and at the same"
5457,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"time free from preconceptions, have come nearer to the fundamental"
5458,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"elements of the problem and have given out suggestions which, even if"
5459,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"not satisfactory in their actual form, are helpful and interesting in"
5460,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"their tendency. Such a thinker is the contemporary French poet, Jean"
5461,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"Lahor, who, in a volume of thoughts entitled ""La gloire du néant,"" has"
5462,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"gathered together three philosophical points of view, we might almost"
5463,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"say three religions, and combined their issues in a way which may now"
5464,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"seem again new, but which in reality is as old as wisdom."
5465,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,
5466,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,The form is literary and the outcome in a sense negative; there is
5467,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"no attempt to put new wine into old bottles, no apologetic tone, no"
5468,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"unction. Experience is consulted afresh, without preoccupation as to"
5469,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"the results of reflection; and if these results are religious, it is"
5470,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"because any reasoned appreciation of life is bound to be a religion,"
5471,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,even if no conventionally religious elements are imported into the
5472,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"problem. In fact, those prophets who have said that the Sabbath was"
5473,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"made for man and who have given moral functions to historical religion,"
5474,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"as well as those philosophers who have best understood its nature, have"
5475,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"seemed irreligious to their contemporaries, because they have looked"
5476,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"upon religion as an interpretation of reality, not as a quasi-reality"
5477,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,existing by itself and vouched for merely by tradition and miracle.
5478,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,Religion is an imaginative echo of things natural and moral: and if
5479,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"this echo is to be well attuned, our ear must first be attentive to the"
5480,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"natural sounds of which, in religion, we are to develop the harmony."
5481,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,
5482,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"It is, therefore, not an objection to Jean Lahor's competence to"
5483,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,gather for us the elements of a religion that he is a poet rather
5484,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"than a theologian and an observer rather than a philosopher, or that"
5485,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,he presents his intuitions without technical apparatus in a series of
5486,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,highly coloured epigrams and little pictures. On the contrary such
5487,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"simplicity and directness are an advantage when, as in this case, the"
5488,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"guiding inspiration is religious. It is religious because, on the one"
5489,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"hand, it is imaginative; we are asking ourselves everywhere what Nature"
5490,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"says to us and what we are to say in reply; and on the other hand,"
5491,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"because it is rational, and these messages and reactions are to be"
5492,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,unified into a single science and a single morality. The logical scheme
5493,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,of the system is not made explicit: there is no argumentation and no
5494,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,answers are offered to the objections that might naturally suggest
5495,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,themselves. But the sayings are so arranged and made so to progress
5496,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,in tone and subject that a system of philosophy is clearly implied in
5497,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,them; and the essence of this system is at times briefly expressed.
5498,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,
5499,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"All, as it behooves a poet, is the transcript of personal experience."
5500,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"We must not look for the inclusion of elements, however important"
5501,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"in themselves, which the author has not found in his own life. The"
5502,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,omissions are in this case as characteristic as the inclusions. We
5503,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"look in vain, for instance, for any appreciation of Christianity or"
5504,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,of all that side of human nature and experience on which faith in
5505,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"Christianity rests; we hear nothing of love and its ideal suggestions,"
5506,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"nothing of the aspiration to immortality, nothing of the whole"
5507,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,transcendental attitude toward experience. These are grave omissions.
5508,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"They may seem to condemn Jean Lahor, if not as a general philosopher,"
5509,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,at least as a representative of an age in which religious thought has
5510,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,so largely centred about these very questions. But our century has
5511,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,been an age of confusion; and a man who at its end wishes to attain
5512,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"some coherence of life and mind, must begin by letting drop much that"
5513,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,the age has held in solution. It is by not being an average that a man
5514,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,may become a guide. Only by manifesting the direction of change and
5515,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,embodying that change in his own person can he be a sign of progress.
5516,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,It remains for time to show whether what survives in a given man has
5517,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,fortune on its side and contains the inward elements of vitality.
5518,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"The presumption in this case, when we abstract from our personal"
5519,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"prejudices, will seem to be wholly in favour of our author."
5520,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,
5521,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,The three influences to which he has yielded and which have moulded
5522,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"his mind are the pantheism of the Hindoos, our contemporary natural"
5523,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"science, and the ideal of Greek civilization. These three elements"
5524,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"might at first sight seem incongruous, and the principle of selection"
5525,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,by which they are preferred above all others might seem as hard
5526,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,to find as the principle of union by which they are to be welded
5527,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,into one philosophy. But a little study of these maxims and of the
5528,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"autobiographical sketch which precedes them will, I think, enable"
5529,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,us to discover both the principles we miss. The selection of the
5530,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,three influences in question is due to the poetical temperament and
5531,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"scientific tastes of the author, to an individual disposition and to"
5532,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,studies which drew him successively to these different sources of
5533,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"instruction. The principle of synthesis, or rather, we should perhaps"
5534,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"say, of subordination, by which these various habits of thought are"
5535,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"combined in one philosophy, is a moral principle. It is a native power"
5536,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,to conceive the ideal and a native loyalty to the ideal when once
5537,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,conceived. This moral enthusiasm is in no sense vapid or sentimental;
5538,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,it hardly comes to the surface in any direct or enthusiastic
5539,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"expression; but it is betrayed and proved to be sincere, now by a"
5540,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"passionate pessimism about the natural world, now in detailed and"
5541,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,practical demands for a better state of society. A genial individuality
5542,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"and a well-reasoned form of pessimism are, then, the two factors in the"
5543,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"development of this interesting thinker, the two keys to the apparently"
5544,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,contradictory affinities of his mind.
5545,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,
5546,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"Our author, as we have said, is a poet, and even if his verses seem"
5547,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"at times a little thin and rhetorical, they prove abundantly what is"
5548,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"evident also in his prose, namely, that he has keen sensations, that"
5549,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"images impress themselves upon him with force, and that any scene"
5550,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,whose elements are gorgeous and picturesque or which is weighted with
5551,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"tragic emotion, holds his attention and awakens in him the impulse to"
5552,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"literary expression. But this plastic impulse is not powerful, or finds"
5553,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,in the environment insufficient support. Great art and great creative
5554,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"achievements are rare in the world, and come for the most part only"
5555,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,in those moments and in those places where an unusual concentration
5556,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,of mental energy and the friction of many kindred minds allow the
5557,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,scattered sparks of inspiration to merge and to leap into flame. We
5558,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"need not wonder, therefore, that the æsthetic sensibility of our author"
5559,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,is greater than his artistic success. Of which of our contemporaries
5560,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,might we not say the same thing? Jean Lahor's attention is analytic; he
5561,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"is absorbed by his model, he does not absorb it and master it by his"
5562,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,art. He has not enough vigour and determination of thought to create
5563,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,eternal forms out of the swift hints of perception. He watches rather
5564,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"passively the flight of his ideas, conscious of their vivacity, of"
5565,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"their beauty, but most of all, alas! of their flight. His last word as"
5566,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"an observer, his message as a poet, is that all things are illusion."
5567,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"They fade, they pass into one another, the place thereof knows them no"
5568,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"more. Nothing of them remains, absolutely nothing, save the universal"
5569,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,indeterminate force that breeds and devours them perpetually.
5570,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,
5571,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,A mind thus gifted and thus limited would naturally feel its affinity
5572,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,to Oriental pantheism as soon as that phase of thought and feeling came
5573,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,within the radius of its vision. Jean Lahor seems early to have felt an
5574,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"attraction toward the speculation of the East, and his prolonged study"
5575,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,of that literature could of course only intensify the natural bent of
5576,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"his mind, and give his thought a more pronounced pantheistic colouring."
5577,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"Had he been wholly absorbed, however, in such mystical contemplation,"
5578,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,we should have had little to study in him that was new; only one more
5579,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"case of sensibility and fancy overpowering a timid intellect, one more"
5580,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,gifted nature arrested at the stage of bewilderment.
5581,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,
5582,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"But as Jean Lahor is only a pseudonym for the man, so the sympathy with"
5583,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,India which that name indicates is only one phase of the thinker. Our
5584,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,poet pursued the study of medicine; he realized in the concrete the
5585,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,orderly complexities of natural law and the sordid realities of human
5586,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"life. The vague, sensuous enthusiasm with which he had followed the"
5587,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,flux of images in his fancy was now sobered by an accurate knowledge
5588,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"of the miseries, the defeats, the shames that lie beneath. His poetic"
5589,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,sense of illusion was deepened into a moral sense of wrong. The same
5590,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"keenness of perception, the same power of graphic expression, which"
5591,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,had made him dwell on the luxuriance of Nature now made him paint
5592,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,the irony and brutality of life. There is here and there a touch of
5593,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"bitterness and exaggeration in the satire, as if the man of science"
5594,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,felt a personal resentment against a world that had so cheated the poet.
5595,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,
5596,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,Yet the two descriptions are far from inconsistent; we have merely
5597,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,learned to understand as a process and to conceive as an inner
5598,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,experience what before we had admired as a spectacle. A scientific
5599,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,view has come to give definition and coherence to phenomena which a
5600,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,poetical pantheism merely saluted as they passed and disappeared into
5601,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"the primordial darkness, or, if you like, into the primordial light."
5602,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"The two systems differ in tone and in method, but not in result."
5603,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"Natural science, like pantheism, presents us with a universal flux, in"
5604,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"which something, we known not what, moves, we know not why, we know"
5605,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,not whither. The method of this transformation may be more or less
5606,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"accurately described, the general sense of continuity and necessity"
5607,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,may find a more or less specific expression in the various fields
5608,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,of experience; yet the outcome is still the same whirligig. We find
5609,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"ourselves in either case confronted by the same _gloire du néant_, by a"
5610,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,nothing that lives and that is beautiful in its nothingness.
5611,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,
5612,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"These two elements in Jean Lahor's philosophy, the Oriental and"
5613,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"the scientific, would thus tend alike to represent man with his"
5614,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,intelligence as the product and the captive of an irrational engine
5615,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,called the universe. Many a man accepts this solution and reconciles
5616,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,himself as best he can to the truth as it appears to him. What is
5617,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"there, he may say, so dreadful in mutability? What so intolerable in"
5618,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"ultimate ignorance? We know what we need to know, and things last,"
5619,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"perhaps, as long as they deserve to last. So, once convinced that his"
5620,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"naturalistic philosophy is final, a man will silence the demands of"
5621,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,his own reason and call them chimerical. There is nothing to which
5622,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"men, while they have food and drink, cannot reconcile themselves. They"
5623,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"will put up with present suffering, with the certainty of death, with"
5624,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"solitude, with shame, with wrong, with the expectation of eternal"
5625,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"damnation. In the face of such things, they can not only be happy"
5626,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"for the moment, but solemnly thank God for having brought them into"
5627,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"existence. Habit is stronger than reason, and the respect for fact"
5628,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,stronger than the respect for the ideal; nor would the ideal and reason
5629,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,ever prevail did they not make up in persistence what they lack in
5630,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,momentary energy.
5631,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,
5632,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"It would have been easy, therefore, for Jean Lahor, as for the rest"
5633,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"of us, to remain in the naturalistic world, had he had only poetical"
5634,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"intuition, or only scientific training, or only both. But there was"
5635,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"also in him a third and a moral element, an impulse toward ideal"
5636,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"creation, a spark of Promethean fire. He felt a genuine admiration"
5637,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"for that humane courage which made the Greeks, for all their clear"
5638,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"consciousness of fate, hopeful without illusions and independent"
5639,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,without rebellion. In the bosom of the intractable infinite he still
5640,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"distinguished the work of human reason--the cosmos of society,"
5641,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"character, and art--like a Noah's ark floating in the Deluge. His"
5642,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,imagination had succumbed to the dream of sense; his art had not
5643,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,attempted the task of imposing a meaning or an immortal form upon
5644,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,Nature: but his conscience and his political instinct had held out
5645,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,against the fascinations of Maya. The Greek asserted himself here
5646,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"against the barbarian, the moralist against the naturalist. Nor was"
5647,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,this a merely accidental addition or an inconsistency. It was the
5648,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,explicit expression of that creative reason which had all along chafed
5649,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,under the dominion of brute fact and of perpetual illusion. The same
5650,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,moral energy which had made him a pessimist in the presence of Nature
5651,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,made him an idealist at the threshold of life.
5652,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,
5653,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,For why should the natural world ever come to be called a world of
5654,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,illusion? To call the vivid objects of sense illusory is to compare
5655,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,them to their disadvantage with something else which we conceive as
5656,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,more worthy of the title of reality. This deeper reality must be
5657,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"something ideal, something permanent, something conceived by the"
5658,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"intellect, and which only a man having faith in the intellect could"
5659,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,prefer to the objects of sense or fancy. The Hindoos that our author
5660,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,thinks so much akin to himself would hardly understand this rational
5661,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"bias of his thought, this foregone dissatisfaction with a world of"
5662,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,infinite change and indefinite structure. They would accept as a
5663,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,natural fact that perpetual flux which he emphasizes as a paradox and
5664,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,laments as a calamity. In spite of his studied immersion in sensuous
5665,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"illusion, he is still a native of the sphere of intelligible things,"
5666,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,and it is only the difficulty of finding the permanent beings which he
5667,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,is inclined to look for and in the presence of which he could alone
5668,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"rest, that makes him linger with tragic self-consciousness in the"
5669,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,region of fleeting shadows. Accordingly we need not be surprised by the
5670,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,somewhat forced and pessimistic note of a pantheism which is really
5671,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"exotic, and we may be prepared to find the plastic mind asserting"
5672,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"itself ultimately against that system. So Jean Lahor, after the groups"
5673,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"of thoughts which he puts under the title of ""L'orient"" and ""Le ciel du"
5674,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"Nord,"" adds another group under the title of ""Cosmos."""
5675,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,
5676,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,It would require a philosophical treatise of greater pretentions than
5677,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,the little book before us to explain fully how this cosmos can arise
5678,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"out of the chaos of mechanical forces, and how the life and the work"
5679,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,of reason can be superposed upon the life of sense and imagination.
5680,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"Our author's vision, fixed as it is on concrete images and expressed"
5681,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"in detached epigrams, does not always extend to the philosophical"
5682,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"relations of his thoughts. Yet he offers, perhaps unconsciously, an"
5683,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,admirable variation of that revolution of thought which is associated
5684,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,with the name of Kant. He proposes to us as the work of human
5685,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,intelligence what is commonly believed to be the work of God. The
5686,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"universe, apart from us, is a chaos, but it may be made a cosmos by our"
5687,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"efforts and in our own minds. The laws of events, apart from us, are"
5688,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"inhuman and irrational, but in the sphere of human activity they may be"
5689,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"dominated by reason. We are a part of the blind energy behind Nature,"
5690,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,but by virtue of that energy we impose our purposes on the part of
5691,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,Nature which we constitute or control. We can turn from the stupefying
5692,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"contemplation of an alien universe to the building of our own house,"
5693,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"knowing that, alien as it is, that universe has chanced to blow its"
5694,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,energy also into our will and to allow itself to be partially dominated
5695,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,by our intelligence. Our mere existence and the modicum of success we
5696,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"have attained in society, science, and art are the living proofs of"
5697,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,this human power. The exercise of this power is the task appointed for
5698,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"us by the indomitable promptings of our own spirit, a task in which we"
5699,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,need not labour without hope.
5700,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,
5701,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,For as the various plants and animals have found foothold and room
5702,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"to grow, maintaining for long periods the life congenial to them, so"
5703,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,the human race may be able to achieve something like its perfection
5704,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"and its ideal, maintaining for an indefinite time all that it values,"
5705,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"not by virtue of an alleged intentional protection of Providence, but"
5706,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,by its own watchful art and exceptional good fortune. The ideal is
5707,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,itself a function of the reality and cannot therefore be altogether
5708,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,out of harmony with the conditions of its own birth and persistence.
5709,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"Civilization is precarious, but it need not be short-lived. Its"
5710,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,inception is already a proof that there exists an equilibrium of forces
5711,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,which is favourable to its existence; and there is no reason to suppose
5712,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,this equilibrium to be less stable than that which keeps the planets
5713,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"revolving in their orbits. There is no impossibility, therefore, in"
5714,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"the hope that the human will may have time to understand itself, and,"
5715,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"having understood itself, to realize the objects of its rational desire."
5716,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,
5717,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"We see that the ""Cosmos"" here invoked is not inconsistent with the"
5718,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"""Nothingness"" before described. It is a triumph amid illusions, an"
5719,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"order within chaos, _la gloire du néant_. This hint of a reconciliation"
5720,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"between the practical optimism natural to an active being, and the"
5721,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"speculative pessimism inevitable to an intelligent one, is happier"
5722,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,than the muddled solutions of the same problem with which current
5723,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,philosophies have made us familiar. The philosophy suggested by Jean
5724,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"Lahor is that of Spinoza, if we subtract from the latter its mystical"
5725,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"optimism, and add a broad appreciation of human culture. Man cannot"
5726,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,attain his happiness by conforming to that which is hostile to himself;
5727,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,he can thus attain only his dissolution. But by using what is hostile
5728,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"to himself for his own ends, as far as his energy extends, he can make"
5729,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"an oasis for himself in Nature, and being at peace with himself, be at"
5730,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,peace also with her.
5731,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,
5732,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,Such a view has some relation to the real conditions of human life and
5733,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"progress. What is called the higher optimism, on the contrary, commonly"
5734,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,consists in recounting all the evils of existence with a radiant
5735,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"countenance, and telling us that they are all divine ministers of some"
5736,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"glorious consummation; but what this consummation is never appears, and"
5737,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,we are reduced in practice to a mere glorification of impulse. We are
5738,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"simply invited to accept the conditions of life as they are, and to"
5739,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,find in incidental successes a compensation for incidental or--as we
5740,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,should say if we were sincere--for essential failures. Such an optimism
5741,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,impairs by a kind of philosophic Nature-worship that moral loyalty
5742,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"which consists in giving the highest honour to the highest, not to the"
5743,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"strongest, things. It substitutes, as pantheism must, the study of"
5744,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"tendencies for the study of ends, and the dignity of success for the"
5745,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,dignity of justice.
5746,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,
5747,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,This moral confusion our author avoids by his greater sincerity. He has
5748,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,understood how fundamentally that man is a dupe who does not begin by
5749,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,settling his accounts with Despair. There is no safety in lies; there
5750,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"is no safety even in ""postulates."" Let the worst of the truth appear,"
5751,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"and when it has once seen the light, let it not be immediately wrapped"
5752,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,up again in the swaddling clothes of an equivocal rhetoric. In such a
5753,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,disingenuous course there is both temerity and cowardice: temerity in
5754,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"throwing away the opportunity, always afforded by the recognition of"
5755,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"fact, of cultivating the real faculties of human nature; cowardice in"
5756,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,not being willing to face with patience and dignity the situation in
5757,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"which fate appears to have put us. That Nature is immense, that her"
5758,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"laws are mechanical, that the existence and well-being of man upon"
5759,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"earth are, from the point of view of the universe, an indifferent"
5760,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"incident,--all this is in the first place to be clearly recognized. It"
5761,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,is the lesson which both poetic contemplation and practical science had
5762,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,taught Jean Lahor.
5763,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,
5764,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"Had he stopped to subject his opinion to metaphysical criticism, he"
5765,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"would not, I think, have found reason to change it. To subjectify"
5766,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"the universe is not to improve it, much less to dissolve it. The"
5767,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,space I call my idea has all the properties of the space I called
5768,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,my environment; it has the same inevitable presence and the same
5769,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,fundamental validity. Because it is a law of our intelligence that
5770,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"two and two make four, and the implications of that law may be traced"
5771,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"by abstract thought, the world which is subject to that arithmetical"
5772,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,principle is not made more amenable to our higher demands than if it
5773,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,had been arithmetical of its own sweet will. It is not made docile
5774,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"by being called our creature. Indeed, what is less docile to us than"
5775,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,ourselves? what less subject to our correction than the foundations of
5776,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,our own being? So when the Kantian philosophy teaches us to look upon
5777,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,the enveloping universe as a figment of the understanding and on its
5778,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"laws as results of mental synthesis and inference, we are still pursued"
5779,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,by the inevitable presence of that figment and confronted involuntarily
5780,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"by that result. Nay, the conditions of our thought, like the"
5781,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"predispositions of our characters, are the most fatal and inexorable of"
5782,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,our limitations.
5783,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,
5784,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"Why the world is as it is, whether of itself or by refraction in the"
5785,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"medium of our intellect, is not a question that affects the practical"
5786,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"moralist. What concerns him is that the laws of the world, whatever"
5787,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"their origin, are fixed and unchangeable conditions of our happiness."
5788,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"We cannot change the world, even if we boast to have made it; we must"
5789,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"in any case learn to live with it, whether it be our parent or our"
5790,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,child. To veil its character with euphemisms or to supply its defects
5791,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,with superstitious assumptions is a course unworthy of a brave man
5792,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,and abhorrent to a prudent one. What we should do is to make a modest
5793,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,inventory of our possessions and a just estimate of our powers in
5794,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"order to apply both, with what strength we have, to the realization of"
5795,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"our ideals in society, in art, and in science. These will constitute"
5796,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,our Cosmos. In building it--for there is none other that builds it
5797,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,for us--we shall be carrying on the work of the only race that has
5798,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"yet seriously attempted to live rationally, the race to which we owe"
5799,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,"the name and the idea of a Cosmos, as well as the beginnings of its"
5800,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,realization. We shall then be making that rare advance in wisdom which
5801,A RELIGION OF DISILLUSION,consists in abandoning our illusions the better to attain our ideals.

5812,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"If a critic, in despair of giving a serious definition of poetry,"
5813,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"should be satisfied with saying that poetry is metrical discourse,"
5814,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"he would no doubt be giving an inadequate account of the matter, yet"
5815,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,not one of which he need be ashamed or which he should regard as
5816,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,superficial. Although a poem be not made by counting of syllables
5817,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"upon the fingers, yet ""numbers"" is the most poetical synonym we have"
5818,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"for verse, and ""measure"" the most significant equivalent for beauty,"
5819,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"for goodness, and perhaps even for truth. Those early and profound"
5820,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"philosophers, the followers of Pythagoras, saw the essence of all"
5821,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"things in number, and it was by weight, measure, and number, as we read"
5822,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"in the Bible, that the Creator first brought Nature out of the void."
5823,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,Every human architect must do likewise with his edifice; he must mould
5824,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,his bricks or hew his stones into symmetrical solids and lay them over
5825,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"one another in regular strata, like a poet's lines."
5826,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
5827,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"Measure is a condition of perfection, for perfection requires that"
5828,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"order should be pervasive, that not only the whole before us should"
5829,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"have a form, but that every part in turn should have a form of its"
5830,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"own, and that those parts should be coordinated among themselves as"
5831,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,the whole is coordinated with the other parts of some greater cosmos.
5832,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,Leibnitz lighted in his speculations upon a conception of organic
5833,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"nature which may be false as a fact, but which is excellent as an"
5834,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"ideal; he tells us that the difference between living and dead matter,"
5835,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"between animals and machines, is that the former are composed of parts"
5836,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"that are themselves organic, every portion of the body being itself"
5837,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"a machine, and every portion of that machine still a machine, and so"
5838,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"_ad infinitum_; whereas, in artificial bodies the organization is not"
5839,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"in this manner infinitely deep. Fine Art, in this as in all things,"
5840,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,imitates the method of Nature and makes its most beautiful works out of
5841,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,materials that are themselves beautiful. So that even if the difference
5842,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"between verse and prose consisted only in measure, that difference"
5843,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,would already be analogous to that between jewels and clay.
5844,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
5845,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"The stuff of language is words, and the sensuous material of words"
5846,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"is sound; if language therefore is to be made perfect, its materials"
5847,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"must be made beautiful by being themselves subjected to a measure,"
5848,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,and endowed with a form. It is true that language is a symbol for
5849,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"intelligence rather than a stimulus to sense, and accordingly the"
5850,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,beauties of discourse which commonly attract attention are merely the
5851,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,beauties of the objects and ideas signified; yet the symbols have a
5852,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"sensible reality of their own, a euphony which appeals to our senses"
5853,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,if we keep them open. The tongue will choose those forms of utterance
5854,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,which have a natural grace as mere sound and sensation; the memory will
5855,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"retain these catches, and they will pass and repass through the mind"
5856,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,until they become types of instinctive speech and standards of pleasing
5857,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,expression.
5858,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
5859,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,The highest form of such euphony is song; the singing voice gives
5860,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"to the sounds it utters the thrill of tonality,--a thrill itself"
5861,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"dependent, as we know, on the numerical proportions of the vibrations"
5862,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"that it includes. But this kind of euphony and sensuous beauty, the"
5863,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"deepest that sounds can have, we have almost wholly surrendered in our"
5864,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"speech. Our intelligence has become complex, and language, to express"
5865,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"our thoughts, must commonly be more rapid, copious, and abstract than"
5866,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,is compatible with singing. Music at the same time has become complex
5867,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"also, and when united with words, at one time disfigures them in the"
5868,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"elaboration of its melody, and at another overpowers them in the volume"
5869,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,of its sound. So that the art of singing is now in the same plight as
5870,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"that of sculpture,--an abstract and conventional thing surviving by"
5871,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"force of tradition and of an innate but now impotent impulse, which"
5872,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,under simpler conditions would work itself out into the proper forms of
5873,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,those arts. The truest kind of euphony is thus denied to our poetry. If
5874,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"any verses are still set to music, they are commonly the worst only,"
5875,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,chosen for the purpose by musicians of specialized sensibility and
5876,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"inferior intelligence, who seem to be attracted only by tawdry effects"
5877,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,of rhetoric and sentiment.
5878,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
5879,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"When song is given up, there still remains in speech a certain sensuous"
5880,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"quality, due to the nature and order of the vowels and consonants"
5881,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,that compose the sounds. This kind of euphony is not neglected by the
5882,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"more dulcet poets, and is now so studied in some quarters that I have"
5883,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,heard it maintained by a critic of relative authority that the beauty
5884,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,of poetry consists entirely in the frequent utterance of the sound
5885,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"of ""j"" and ""sh,"" and the consequent copious flow of saliva in the"
5886,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"mouth. But even if saliva is not the whole essence of poetry, there"
5887,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,is an unmistakable and fundamental diversity of effect in the various
5888,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"vocalization of different poets, which becomes all the more evident"
5889,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"when we compare those who use different languages. One man's speech, or"
5890,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"one nation's, is compact, crowded with consonants, rugged, broken with"
5891,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"emphatic beats; another man's, or nation's, is open, tripping, rapid,"
5892,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"and even. So Byron, mingling in his boyish fashion burlesque with"
5893,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"exquisite sentiment, contrasts English with Italian speech:--"
5894,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
5895,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"""I love the language, that soft bastard Latin"
5896,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,Which melts like kisses from a female mouth
5897,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,And sounds as if it should be writ on satin
5898,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"With syllables which breathe of the sweet South,"
5899,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,And gentle liquids gliding all so pat in
5900,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"That not a single accent seems uncouth,"
5901,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"Like our harsh Northern whistling, granting guttural"
5902,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"Which we're obliged to hiss and spit and sputter all."""
5903,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
5904,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"And yet these contrasts, strong when we compare extreme cases, fade"
5905,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,from our consciousness in the actual use of a mother-tongue. The
5906,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"function makes us unconscious of the instrument, all the more as it"
5907,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,is an indispensable and almost invariable one. The sense of euphony
5908,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,accordingly attaches itself rather to another and more variable
5909,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"quality; the tune, or measure, or rhythm of speech. The elementary"
5910,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"sounds are prescribed by the language we use, and the selection we"
5911,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,may make among those sounds is limited; but the arrangement of words
5912,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"is still undetermined, and by casting our speech into the moulds of"
5913,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"metre and rhyme we can give it a heightened power, apart from its"
5914,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"significance. A tolerable definition of poetry, on its formal side,"
5915,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,might be found in this: that poetry is speech in which the instrument
5916,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,counts as well as the meaning--poetry is speech for its own sake and
5917,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,for its own sweetness. As common windows are intended only to admit
5918,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"the light, but painted windows also to dye it, and to be an object"
5919,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,of attention in themselves as well as a cause of visibility in other
5920,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"things, so, while the purest prose is a mere vehicle of thought, verse,"
5921,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"like stained glass, arrests attention in its own intricacies, confuses"
5922,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"it in its own glories, and is even at times allowed to darken and"
5923,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,puzzle in the hope of casting over us a supernatural spell.
5924,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
5925,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"Long passages in Shelley's ""Revolt of Islam"" and Keats' ""Endymion"""
5926,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"are poetical in this sense; the reader gathers, probably, no definite"
5927,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"meaning, but is conscious of a poetic medium, of speech euphonious"
5928,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"and measured, and redolent of a kind of objectless passion which is"
5929,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,little more than the sensation of the movement and sensuous richness
5930,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"of the lines. Such poetry is not great; it has, in fact, a tedious"
5931,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"vacuity, and is unworthy of a mature mind; but it is poetical, and"
5932,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,could be produced only by a legitimate child of the Muse. It belongs to
5933,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"an apprenticeship, but in this case the apprenticeship of genius. It"
5934,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,bears that relation to great poems which scales and aimless warblings
5935,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,bear to great singing--they test the essential endowment and fineness
5936,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,of the organ which is to be employed in the art. Without this sensuous
5937,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"background and ingrained predisposition to beauty, no art can reach the"
5938,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,deepest and most exquisite effects; and even without an intelligible
5939,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,superstructure these sensuous qualities suffice to give that thrill of
5940,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"exaltation, that suggestion of an ideal world, which we feel in the"
5941,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,presence of any true beauty.
5942,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
5943,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"The sensuous beauty of words and their utterance in measure suffice,"
5944,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"therefore, for poetry of one sort--where these are there is something"
5945,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"unmistakably poetical, although the whole of poetry, or the best of"
5946,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"poetry, be not yet there. Indeed, in such works as ""The Revolt of"
5947,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"Islam"" or ""Endymion"" there is already more than mere metre and sound;"
5948,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"there is the colour and choice of words, the fanciful, rich, or"
5949,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,exquisite juxtaposition of phrases. The vocabulary and the texture of
5950,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"the style are precious; affected, perhaps, but at any rate refined."
5951,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
5952,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"This quality, which is that almost exclusively exploited by the"
5953,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"Symbolist, we may call euphuism--the choice of coloured words and"
5954,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,rare and elliptical phrases. If great poets are like architects and
5955,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"sculptors, the euphuists are like gold-smiths and jewellers; their work"
5956,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"is filigree in precious metals, encrusted with glowing stones. Now"
5957,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,euphuism contributes not a little to the poetic effect of the tirades
5958,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,of Keats and Shelley; if we wish to see the power of versification
5959,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"without euphuism we may turn to the tirades of Pope, where metre and"
5960,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"euphony are displayed alone, and we have the outline or skeleton of"
5961,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,poetry without the filling.

5964,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"One truth is clear, Whatever is, is right."""
5965,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
5966,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,We should hesitate to say that such writing was truly poetical; so
5967,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"that some euphuism would seem to be necessary as well as metre, to the"
5968,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,formal essence of poetry.
5969,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
5970,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"An example of this sort, however, takes us out of the merely verbal"
5971,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,into the imaginative region; the reason that Pope is hardly poetical to
5972,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"us is not that he is inharmonious,--not a defect of euphony,--but that"
5973,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,he is too intellectual and has an excess of mentality. It is easier for
5974,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"words to be poetical without any thought, when they are felt merely"
5975,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"as sensuous and musical, than for them to remain so when they convey"
5976,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"an abstract notion,--especially if that notion be a tart and frigid"
5977,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"sophism, like that of the couplet just quoted. The pyrotechnics of the"
5978,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"intellect then take the place of the glow of sense, and the artifice"
5979,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,of thought chills the pleasure we might have taken in the grace of
5980,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,expression.
5981,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
5982,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"If poetry in its higher reaches is more philosophical than history,"
5983,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,because it presents the memorable types of men and things apart from
5984,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"unmeaning circumstances, so in its primary substance and texture"
5985,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,poetry is more philosophical than prose because it is nearer to our
5986,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,immediate experience. Poetry breaks up the trite conceptions designated
5987,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,by current words into the sensuous qualities out of which those
5988,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,conceptions were originally put together. We name what we conceive and
5989,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"believe in, not what we see; things, not images; souls, not voices and"
5990,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"silhouettes. This naming, with the whole education of the senses which"
5991,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"it accompanies, subserves the uses of life; in order to thread our way"
5992,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"through the labyrinth of objects which assault us, we must make a great"
5993,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,selection in our sensuous experience; half of what we see and hear we
5994,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"must pass over as insignificant, while we piece out the other half with"
5995,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,such an ideal complement as is necessary to turn it into a fixed and
5996,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"well-ordered world. This labour of perception and understanding, this"
5997,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,spelling of the material meaning of experience is enshrined in our
5998,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,work-a-day language and ideas; ideas which are literally poetic in the
5999,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"sense that they are ""made"" (for every conception in an adult mind is a"
6000,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"fiction), but which are at the same time prosaic because they are made"
6001,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"economically, by abstraction, and for use."
6002,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6003,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"When the child of poetic genius, who has learned this intellectual and"
6004,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"utilitarian language in the cradle, goes afield and gathers for himself"
6005,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"the aspects of Nature, he begins to encumber his mind with the many"
6006,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"living impressions which the intellect rejected, and which the language"
6007,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,of the intellect can hardly convey; he labours with his nameless burden
6008,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"of perception, and wastes himself in aimless impulses of emotion and"
6009,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"revery, until finally the method of some art offers a vent to his"
6010,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"inspiration, or to such part of it as can survive the test of time and"
6011,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,the discipline of expression.
6012,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6013,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"The poet retains by nature the innocence of the eye, or recovers it"
6014,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,easily; he disintegrates the fictions of common perception into their
6015,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"sensuous elements, gathers these together again into chance groups as"
6016,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,the accidents of his environment or the affinities of his temperament
6017,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,may conjoin them; and this wealth of sensation and this freedom of
6018,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"fancy, which make an extraordinary ferment in his ignorant heart,"
6019,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,presently bubble over into some kind of utterance.
6020,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6021,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,The fulness and sensuousness of such effusions bring them nearer to
6022,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,our actual perceptions than common discourse could come; yet they may
6023,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"easily seem remote, overloaded, and obscure to those accustomed to"
6024,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"think entirely in symbols, and never to be interrupted in the algebraic"
6025,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,rapidity of their thinking by a moment's pause and examination of
6026,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"heart, nor ever to plunge for a moment into that torrent of sensation"
6027,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,and imagery over which the bridge of prosaic associations habitually
6028,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,carries us safe and dry to some conventional act. How slight that
6029,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"bridge commonly is, how much an affair of trestles and wire, we can"
6030,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,hardly conceive until we have trained ourselves to an extreme sharpness
6031,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"of introspection. But psychologists have discovered, what laymen"
6032,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"generally will confess, that we hurry by the procession of our mental"
6033,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"images as we do by the traffic of the street, intent on business,"
6034,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"gladly forgetting the noise and movement of the scene, and looking"
6035,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,only for the corner we would turn or the door we would enter. Yet in
6036,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,our alertest moment the depths of the soul are still dreaming; the real
6037,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,world stands drawn in bare outline against a background of chaos and
6038,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,unrest. Our logical thoughts dominate experience only as the parallels
6039,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,and meridians make a checker-board of the sea. They guide our voyage
6040,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"without controlling the waves, which toss for ever in spite of our"
6041,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,ability to ride over them to our chosen ends. Sanity is a madness put
6042,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,to good uses; waking life is a dream controlled.
6043,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6044,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,Out of the neglected riches of this dream the poet fetches his wares.
6045,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,He dips into the chaos that underlies the rational shell of the world
6046,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"and brings up some superfluous image, some emotion dropped by the"
6047,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"way, and reattaches it to the present object; he reinstates things"
6048,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"unnecessary, he emphasizes things ignored, he paints in again into"
6049,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,the landscape the tints which the intellect has allowed to fade from
6050,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"it. If he seems sometimes to obscure a fact, it is only because he is"
6051,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,restoring an experience. We may observe this process in the simplest
6052,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"cases. When Ossian, mentioning the sun, says it is round as the shield"
6053,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"of his fathers, the expression is poetical. Why? Because he has added"
6054,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"to the word sun, in itself sufficient and unequivocal, other words,"
6055,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"unnecessary for practical clearness, but serving to restore the"
6056,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,individuality of his perception and its associations in his mind.
6057,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,There is no square sun with which the sun he is speaking of could be
6058,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"confused; to stop and call it round is a luxury, a halting in the"
6059,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"sensation for the love of its form. And to go on to tell us, what is"
6060,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"wholly impertinent, that the shield of his fathers was round also, is"
6061,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"to invite us to follow the chance wanderings of his fancy, to give us"
6062,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"a little glimpse of the stuffing of his own brain, or, we might almost"
6063,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"say, to turn over the pattern of his embroidery and show us the loose"
6064,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,threads hanging out on the wrong side. Such an escapade disturbs and
6065,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"interrupts the true vision of the object, and a great poet, rising to"
6066,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"a perfect conception of the sun and forgetting himself, would have"
6067,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"disdained to make it; but it has a romantic and pathological interest,"
6068,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"it restores an experience, and is in that measure poetical. We have"
6069,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"been made to halt at the sensation, and to penetrate for a moment into"
6070,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,its background of dream.
6071,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6072,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,But it is not only thoughts or images that the poet draws in this
6073,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"way from the store of his experience, to clothe the bare form of"
6074,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,conventional objects: he often adds to these objects a more subtle
6075,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"ornament, drawn from the same source. For the first element which the"
6076,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,intellect rejects in forming its ideas of things is the emotion which
6077,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,accompanies the perception; and this emotion is the first thing the
6078,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"poet restores. He stops at the image, because he stops to enjoy. He"
6079,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,wanders into the by-paths of association because the by-paths are
6080,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,delightful. The love of beauty which made him give measure and cadence
6081,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"to his words, the love of harmony which made him rhyme them, reappear"
6082,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,in his imagination and make him select there also the material that
6083,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"is itself beautiful, or capable of assuming beautiful forms. The link"
6084,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"that binds together the ideas, sometimes so wide apart, which his wit"
6085,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"assimilates, is most often the link of emotion; they have in common"
6086,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,some element of beauty or of horror.
6087,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6088,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,The poet's art is to a great extent the art of intensifying emotions
6089,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,by assembling the scattered objects that naturally arouse them. He
6090,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,sees the affinities of things by seeing their common affinities with
6091,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,passion. As the guiding principle of practical thinking is some
6092,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"interest, so that only what is pertinent to that interest is selected"
6093,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,by the attention; as the guiding principle of scientific thinking
6094,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"is some connection of things in time or space, or some identity of"
6095,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,law; so in poetic thinking the guiding principle is often a mood or a
6096,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,quality of sentiment. By this union of disparate things having a common
6097,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"overtone of feeling, the feeling is itself evoked in all its strength;"
6098,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"nay, it is often created for the first time, much as by a new mixture"
6099,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,of old pigments Perugino could produce the unprecedented limpidity of
6100,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"his colour, or Titian the unprecedented glow of his. Poets can thus"
6101,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"arouse sentiments finer than any which they have known, and in the act"
6102,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,of composition become discoverers of new realms of delightfulness and
6103,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,grief. Expression is a misleading term which suggests that something
6104,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,previously known is rendered or imitated; whereas the expression is
6105,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"itself an original fact, the values of which are then referred to"
6106,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"the thing expressed, much as the honours of a Chinese mandarin are"
6107,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"attributed retroactively to his parents. So the charm which a poet, by"
6108,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"his art of combining images and shades of emotion, casts over a scene"
6109,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"or an action, is attached to the principal actor in it, who gets the"
6110,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,benefit of the setting furnished him by a well-stocked mind.
6111,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6112,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"The poet is himself subject to this illusion, and a great part of what"
6113,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"is called poetry, although by no means the best part of it, consists"
6114,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,in this sort of idealization by proxy. We dye the world of our own
6115,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"colour; by a pathetic fallacy, by a false projection of sentiment,"
6116,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"we soak Nature with our own feeling, and then celebrate her tender"
6117,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"sympathy with our moral being. This aberration, as we see in the case"
6118,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"of Wordsworth, is not inconsistent with a high development of both"
6119,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"the faculties which it confuses,--I mean vision and feeling. On the"
6120,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"contrary, vision and feeling, when most abundant and original, most"
6121,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,easily present themselves in this undivided form. There would be need
6122,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,of a force of intellect which poets rarely possess to rationalize their
6123,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"inspiration without diminishing its volume: and if, as is commonly the"
6124,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"case, the energy of the dream and the passion in them is greater than"
6125,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"that of the reason, and they cannot attain true propriety and supreme"
6126,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"beauty in their works, they can, nevertheless, fill them with lovely"
6127,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,images and a fine moral spirit.
6128,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6129,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,The pouring forth of both perceptive and emotional elements in their
6130,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,mixed and indiscriminate form gives to this kind of imagination the
6131,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,directness and truth which sensuous poetry possesses on a lower level.
6132,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"The outer world bathed in the hues of human feeling, the inner world"
6133,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"expressed in the forms of things,--that is the primitive condition of"
6134,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,both before intelligence and the prosaic classification of objects have
6135,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,abstracted them and assigned them to their respective spheres. Such
6136,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"identifications, on which a certain kind of metaphysics prides itself"
6137,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"also, are not discoveries of profound genius; they are exactly like"
6138,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,the observation of Ossian that the sun is round and that the shield of
6139,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,his fathers was round too; they are disintegrations of conventional
6140,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"objects, so that the original associates of our perceptions reappear;"
6141,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,then the thing and the emotion which chanced to be simultaneous
6142,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"are said to be one, and we return, unless a better principle of"
6143,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"organization is substituted for the principle abandoned, to the"
6144,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"chaos of a passive animal consciousness, where all is mixed together,"
6145,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"projected together, and felt as an unutterable whole."
6146,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6147,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,The pathetic fallacy is a return to that early habit of thought by
6148,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,which our ancestors peopled the world with benevolent and malevolent
6149,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,spirits; what they felt in the presence of objects they took to be a
6150,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"part of the objects themselves. In returning to this natural confusion,"
6151,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,poetry does us a service in that she recalls and consecrates those
6152,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"phases of our experience which, as useless to the understanding of"
6153,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"material reality, we are in danger of forgetting altogether. Therein"
6154,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"is her vitality, for she pierces to the quick and shakes us out of our"
6155,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,servile speech and imaginative poverty; she reminds us of all we have
6156,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"felt, she invites us even to dream a little, to nurse the wonderful"
6157,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,spontaneous creations which at every waking moment we are snuffing out
6158,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,in our brain. And the indulgence is no mere momentary pleasure; much
6159,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,of its exuberance clings afterward to our ideas; we see the more and
6160,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,feel the more for that exercise; we are capable of finding greater
6161,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,entertainment in the common aspects of Nature and life. When the veil
6162,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"of convention is once removed from our eyes by the poet, we are better"
6163,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"able to dominate any particular experience and, as it were, to change"
6164,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"its scale, now losing ourselves in its infinitesimal texture, now in"
6165,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,its infinite ramifications.
6166,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6167,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"If the function of poetry, however, did not go beyond this recovery"
6168,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"of sensuous and imaginative freedom, at the expense of disrupting our"
6169,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"useful habits of thought, we might be grateful to it for occasionally"
6170,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"relieving our numbness, but we should have to admit that it was nothing"
6171,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,but a relaxation; that spiritual discipline was not to be gained from
6172,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"it in any degree, but must be sought wholly in that intellectual"
6173,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,system that builds the science of Nature with the categories of prose.
6174,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"So conceived, poetry would deserve the judgment passed by Plato on"
6175,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,all the arts of flattery and entertainment; it might be crowned as
6176,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"delightful, but must be either banished altogether as meretricious"
6177,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,or at least confined to a few forms and occasions where it might do
6178,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,little harm. The judgment of Plato has been generally condemned by
6179,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"philosophers, although it is eminently rational, and justified by the"
6180,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"simplest principles of morals. It has been adopted instead, although"
6181,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"unwittingly, by the practical and secular part of mankind, who look"
6182,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,upon artists and poets as inefficient and brain-sick people under whose
6183,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"spell it would be a serious calamity to fall, although they may be"
6184,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,called in on feast days as an ornament and luxury together with the
6185,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"cooks, hairdressers, and florists."
6186,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6187,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"Several circumstances, however, might suggest to us the possibility"
6188,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"that the greatest function of poetry may be still to find. Plato,"
6189,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"while condemning Homer, was a kind of poet himself; his quarrel with"
6190,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,the followers of the Muse was not a quarrel with the goddess; and
6191,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"the good people of Philistia, distrustful as they may be of profane"
6192,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"art, pay undoubting honour to religion, which is a kind of poetry"
6193,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,as much removed from their sphere as the midnight revels upon Mount
6194,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"Citheron, which, to be sure, were also religious in their inspiration."
6195,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"Why, we may ask, these apparent inconsistencies? Why do our practical"
6196,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,men make room for religion in the background of their world? Why did
6197,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"Plato, after banishing the poets, poetize the universe in his prose?"
6198,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,Because the abstraction by which the world of science and of practice
6199,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"is drawn out of our experience, is too violent to satisfy even the"
6200,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"thoughtless and vulgar; the ideality of the machine we call Nature,"
6201,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"the conventionality of the drama we call the world, are too glaring"
6202,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,not to be somehow perceived by all. Each must sometimes fall back upon
6203,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,the soul; he must challenge this apparition with the thought of death;
6204,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,he must ask himself for the mainspring and value of his life. He will
6205,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,then remember his stifled loves; he will feel that only his illusions
6206,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"have ever given him a sense of reality, only his passions the hope and"
6207,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,the vision of peace. He will read himself through and almost gather a
6208,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,meaning from his experience; at least he will half believe that all
6209,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"he has been dealing with was a dream and a symbol, and raise his eyes"
6210,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,toward the truth beyond.
6211,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6212,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"This plastic moment of the mind, when we become aware of the"
6213,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"artificiality and inadequacy of what common sense perceives, is the"
6214,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"true moment of poetic opportunity,--an opportunity, we may hasten"
6215,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"to confess, which is generally missed. The strain of attention, the"
6216,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,concentration and focussing of thought on the unfamiliar immediacy
6217,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"of things, usually brings about nothing but confusion. We are dazed,"
6218,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"we are filled with a sense of unutterable things, luminous yet"
6219,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"indistinguishable, many yet one. Instead of rising to imagination, we"
6220,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,sink into mysticism.
6221,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6222,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,To accomplish a mystical disintegration is not the function of any art;
6223,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"if any art seems to accomplish it, the effect is only incidental, being"
6224,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"involved, perhaps, in the process of constructing the proper object of"
6225,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"that art, as we might cut down trees and dig them up by the roots to"
6226,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,lay the foundations of a temple. For every art looks to the building
6227,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,up of something. And just because the world built up by common sense
6228,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,and natural science is an inadequate world (a skeleton which needs the
6229,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"filling of sensation before it can live), therefore the moment when we"
6230,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,realize its inadequacy is the moment when the higher arts find their
6231,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,opportunity. When the world is shattered to bits they can come and
6232,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"""build it nearer to the heart's desire."""
6233,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6234,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"The great function of poetry, which we have not yet directly mentioned,"
6235,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"is precisely this: to repair to the material of experience, seizing"
6236,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,hold of the reality of sensation and fancy beneath the surface of
6237,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"conventional ideas, and then out of that living but indefinite"
6238,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"material to build new structures, richer, finer, fitter to the primary"
6239,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"tendencies of our nature, truer to the ultimate possibilities of the"
6240,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,soul. Our descent into the elements of our being is then justified by
6241,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,our subsequent freer ascent toward its goal; we revert to sense only to
6242,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,find food for reason; we destroy conventions only to construct ideals.
6243,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6244,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,Such analysis for the sake of creation is the essence of all great
6245,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,poetry. Science and common sense are themselves in their way poets of
6246,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"no mean order, since they take the material of experience and make out"
6247,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"of it a clear, symmetrical, and beautiful world; the very propriety of"
6248,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"this art, however, has made it common. Its figures have become mere"
6249,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"rhetoric and its metaphors prose. Yet, even as it is, a scientific and"
6250,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,mathematical vision has a higher beauty than the irrational poetry of
6251,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"sensation and impulse, which merely tickles the brain, like liquor,"
6252,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"and plays upon our random, imaginative lusts. The imagination of a"
6253,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"great poet, on the contrary, is as orderly as that of an astronomer,"
6254,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"and as large; he has the naturalist's patience, the naturalist's love"
6255,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,of detail and eye trained to see fine gradations and essential lines;
6256,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"he knows no hurry; he has no pose, no sense of originality; he finds"
6257,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"his effects in his subject, and his subject in his inevitable world."
6258,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"Resembling the naturalist in all this, he differs from him in the"
6259,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,balance of his interests; the poet has the concreter mind; his visible
6260,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,world wears all its colours and retains its indwelling passion and
6261,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"life. Instead of studying in experience its calculable elements, he"
6262,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"studies its moral values, its beauty, the openings it offers to the"
6263,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,soul: and the cosmos he constructs is accordingly an ideal theatre for
6264,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,the spirit in which its noblest potential drama is enacted and its
6265,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,destiny resolved.
6266,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6267,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,This supreme function of poetry is only the consummation of the method
6268,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,by which words and imagery are transformed into verse. As verse breaks
6269,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,up the prosaic order of syllables and subjects them to a recognizable
6270,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"and pleasing measure, so poetry breaks up the whole prosaic picture"
6271,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,of experience to introduce into it a rhythm more congenial and
6272,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,intelligible to the mind. And in both these cases the operation is
6273,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"essentially the same as that by which, in an intermediate sphere, the"
6274,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"images rejected by practical thought, and the emotions ignored by"
6275,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"it, are so marshalled as to fill the mind with a truer and intenser"
6276,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"consciousness of its memorable experience. The poetry of fancy, of"
6277,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"observation, and of passion moves on this intermediate level; the"
6278,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,poetry of mere sound and virtuosity is confined to the lower sphere;
6279,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,and the highest is reserved for the poetry of the creative reason. But
6280,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"one principle is present throughout,--the principle of Beauty,--the art"
6281,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"of assimilating phenomena, whether words, images, emotions, or systems"
6282,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"of ideas, to the deeper innate cravings of the mind."
6283,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6284,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,Let us now dwell a little on this higher function of poetry and try to
6285,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,distinguish some of its phases.
6286,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6287,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,The creation of characters is what many of us might at first be
6288,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,tempted to regard as the supreme triumph of the imagination. If we
6289,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"abstract, however, from our personal tastes and look at the matter"
6290,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"in its human and logical relations, we shall see, I think, that the"
6291,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,construction of characters is not the ultimate task of poetic fiction.
6292,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,A character can never be exhaustive of our materials: for it exists
6293,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"by its idiosyncrasy, by its contrast with other natures, by its"
6294,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"development of one side, and one side only, of our native capacities."
6295,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"It is, therefore, not by characterization as such that the ultimate"
6296,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,message can be rendered. The poet can put only a part of himself into
6297,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"any of his heroes, but he must put the whole into his noblest work."
6298,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,A character is accordingly only a fragmentary unity; fragmentary in
6299,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"respect to its origin,--since it is conceived by enlargement, so to"
6300,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"speak, of a part of our own being to the exclusion of the rest,--and"
6301,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"fragmentary in respect to the object it presents, since a character"
6302,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,must live in an environment and be appreciated by contrast and by the
6303,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"sense of derivation. Not the character, but its effects and causes,"
6304,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"is the truly interesting thing. Thus in master poets, like Homer and"
6305,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"Dante, the characters, although well drawn, are subordinate to the"
6306,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,total movement and meaning of the scene There is indeed something
6307,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"pitiful, something comic, in any comprehended soul; souls, like other"
6308,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"things, are only definable by their limitations. We feel instinctively"
6309,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,that it would be insulting to speak of any man to his face as we should
6310,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"speak of him in his absence, even if what we say is in the way of"
6311,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"praise: for absent he is a character understood, but present he is a"
6312,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,force respected.
6313,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6314,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"In the construction of ideal characters, then, the imagination is busy"
6315,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"with material,--particular actions and thoughts,--which suggest their"
6316,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,unification in persons; but the characters thus conceived can hardly
6317,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"be adequate to the profusion of our observations, nor exhaustive, when"
6318,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"all personalities are taken together, of the interest of our lives."
6319,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"Characters are initially imbedded in life, as the gods themselves are"
6320,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"originally imbedded in Nature. Poetry must, therefore, to render all"
6321,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"reality, render also the background of its figures, and the events"
6322,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,that condition their acts. We must place them in that indispensable
6323,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,environment which the landscape furnishes to the eye and the social
6324,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,medium to the emotions.
6325,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6326,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,The visible landscape is not a proper object for poetry. Its
6327,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"elements, and especially the emotional stimulation which it gives,"
6328,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,may be suggested or expressed in verse; but landscape is not thereby
6329,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,represented in its proper form; it appears only as an element and
6330,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"associate of moral unities. Painting, architecture, and gardening, with"
6331,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"the art of stage setting, have the visible landscape for their object,"
6332,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,and to those arts we may leave it. But there is a sort of landscape
6333,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"larger than the visible, which escapes the synthesis of the eye; it"
6334,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,is present to that topographical sense by which we always live in the
6335,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"consciousness that there is a sea, that there are mountains, that the"
6336,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"sky is above us, even when we do not see it, and that the tribes of"
6337,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"men, with their different degrees of blamelessness, are scattered over"
6338,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"the broad-backed earth. This cosmic landscape poetry alone can render,"
6339,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,and it is no small part of the art to awaken the sense of it at the
6340,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"right moment, so that the object that occupies the centre of vision"
6341,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"may be seen in its true lights, coloured by its wider associations,"
6342,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,and dignified by its felt affinities to things permanent and great.
6343,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,As the Italian masters were wont not to paint their groups of saints
6344,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"about the Virgin without enlarging the canvas, so as to render a broad"
6345,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"piece of sky, some mountains and rivers, and nearer, perhaps, some"
6346,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,decorative pile; so the poet of larger mind envelops his characters in
6347,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"the atmosphere of Nature and history, and keeps us constantly aware of"
6348,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,the world in which they move.
6349,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6350,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,The distinction of a poet--the dignity and humanity of his thought--can
6351,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"be measured by nothing, perhaps, so well as by the diameter of the"
6352,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"world in which he lives; if he is supreme, his vision, like Dante's,"
6353,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"always stretches to the stars. And Virgil, a supreme poet sometimes"
6354,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"unjustly belittled, shows us the same thing in another form; his"
6355,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"landscape is the Roman universe, his theme the sacred springs of"
6356,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"Roman greatness in piety, consistancy, and law. He has not written a"
6357,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,line in forgetfulness that he was a Roman; he loves country life and
6358,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,its labours because he sees in it the origin and bulwark of civic
6359,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,greatness; he honours tradition because it gives perspective and
6360,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"momentum to the history that ensues; he invokes the gods, because they"
6361,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"are symbols of the physical and moral forces, by which Rome struggled"
6362,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,to dominion.
6363,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6364,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,Almost every classic poet has the topographical sense; he swarms
6365,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,with proper names and allusions to history and fable; if an epithet
6366,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"is to be thrown in anywhere to fill up the measure of a line, he"
6367,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,chooses instinctively an appellation of place or family; his wine
6368,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"is not red, but Samian; his gorges are not deep, but are the gorges"
6369,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"of Hæmus; his songs are not sweet, but Pierian. We may deride their"
6370,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"practice as conventional, but they could far more justly deride ours"
6371,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"as insignificant. Conventions do not arise without some reason, and"
6372,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,genius will know how to rise above them by a fresh appreciation of
6373,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"their rightness, and will feel no temptation to overturn them in favour"
6374,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,of personal whimsies. The ancients found poetry not so much in sensible
6375,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,accidents as in essential forms and noble associations; and this fact
6376,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,marks very clearly their superior education. They dominated the world
6377,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"as we no longer dominate it, and lived, as we are too distracted to"
6378,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"live, in the presence of the rational and the important."
6379,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6380,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"A physical and historical background, however, is of little moment"
6381,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,to the poet in comparison with that other environment of his
6382,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"characters,--the dramatic situations in which they are involved. The"
6383,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"substance of poetry is, after all, emotion; and if the intellectual"
6384,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,emotion of comprehension and the mimetic one of impersonation are
6385,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"massive, they are not so intense as the appetites and other transitive"
6386,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"emotions of life; the passions are the chief basis of all interests,"
6387,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"even the most ideal, and the passions are seldom brought into play"
6388,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,except by the contact of man with man. The various forms of love and
6389,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"hate are only possible in society, and to imagine occasions in which"
6390,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,these feelings may manifest all their inward vitality is the poet's
6391,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"function,--one in which he follows the fancy of every child, who puffs"
6392,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,himself out in his day-dreams into an endless variety of heroes and
6393,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,lovers. The thrilling adventures which he craves demand an appropriate
6394,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,theatre; the glorious emotions with which he bubbles over must at all
6395,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,hazards find or feign their correlative objects.
6396,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6397,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"But the passions are naturally blind, and the poverty of the"
6398,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"imagination, when left alone, is absolute. The passions may ferment as"
6399,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"they will, they never can breed an idea out of their own energy. This"
6400,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"idea must be furnished by the senses, by outward experience, else the"
6401,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,hunger of the soul will gnaw its own emptiness for ever. Where the
6402,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"seed of sensation has once fallen, however, the growth, variations,"
6403,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,and exuberance of fancy may be unlimited. Only we still observe (as in
6404,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"the child, in dreams, and in the poetry of ignorant or mystical poets)"
6405,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,that the intensity of inwardly generated visions does not involve
6406,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,any real increase in their scope or dignity. The inexperienced mind
6407,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"remains a thin mind, no matter how much its vapours may be heated and"
6408,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,blown about by natural passion. It was a capital error in Fichte and
6409,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,Schopenhauer to assign essential fertility to the will in the creation
6410,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"of ideas. They mistook, as human nature will do, even when at times"
6411,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"it professes pessimism, an ideal for a reality: and because they saw"
6412,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"how much the will clings to its objects, how it selects and magnifies"
6413,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"them, they imagined that it could breed them out of itself. A man who"
6414,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,thinks clearly will see that such self-determination of a will is
6415,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"inconceivable, since what has no external relation and no diversity"
6416,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,of structure cannot of itself acquire diversity of functions. Such
6417,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"inconceivability, of course, need not seem a great objection to a man"
6418,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,of impassioned inspiration; he may even claim a certain consistency in
6419,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"positing, on the strength of his preference, the inconceivable to be a"
6420,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,truth.
6421,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6422,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"The alleged fertility of the will is, however, disproved by"
6423,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"experience, from which metaphysics must in the end draw its analogies"
6424,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"and plausibility. The passions discover, they do not create, their"
6425,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,occasions; a fact which is patent when we observe how they seize
6426,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"upon what objects they find, and how reversible, contingent, and"
6427,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,transferable the emotions are in respect to their objects. A doll
6428,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"will be loved instead of a child, a child instead of a lover, God"
6429,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"instead of everything. The differentiation of the passions, as far as"
6430,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"consciousness is concerned, depends on the variety of the objects of"
6431,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"experience,--that is, on the differentiation of the senses and of the"
6432,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,environment which stimulates them.
6433,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6434,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"When the ""infinite"" spirit enters the human body, it is determined"
6435,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,to certain limited forms of life by the organs which it wears; and
6436,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"its blank potentiality becomes actual in thought and deed, according"
6437,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,to the fortunes and relations of its organism. The ripeness of the
6438,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,passions may thus precede the information of the mind and lead to
6439,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,groping in by-paths without issue; a phenomenon which appears not only
6440,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"in the obscure individual whose abnormalities the world ignores, but"
6441,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"also in the starved, half-educated genius that pours the whole fire of"
6442,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,his soul into trivial arts or grotesque superstitions. The hysterical
6443,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,forms of music and religion are the refuge of an idealism that has
6444,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,lost its way; the waste and failures of life flow largely in those
6445,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,channels. The carnal temptations of youth are incidents of the same
6446,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"maladaptation, when passions assert themselves before the conventional"
6447,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"order of society can allow them physical satisfaction, and long before"
6448,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,philosophy or religion can hope to transform them into fuel for its own
6449,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,sacrificial flames.
6450,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6451,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"Hence flows the greatest opportunity of fiction. We have, in a sense,"
6452,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"an infinite will; but we have a limited experience, an experience sadly"
6453,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,inadequate to exercise that will either in its purity or its strength.
6454,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,To give form to our capacities nothing is required but the appropriate
6455,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"occasion; this the poet, studying the world, will construct for us out"
6456,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,of the materials of his observations. He will involve us in scenes
6457,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,which lie beyond the narrow lane of our daily ploddings; he will place
6458,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"us in the presence of important events, that we may feel our spirit"
6459,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,rise momentarily to the height of his great argument. The possibilities
6460,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"of love or glory, of intrigue and perplexity, will be opened up before"
6461,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"us; if he gives us a good plot, we can readily furnish the characters,"
6462,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,because each of them will be the realization of some stunted potential
6463,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"self of our own. It is by the plot, then, that the characters will be"
6464,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"vivified, because it is by the plot that our own character will be"
6465,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,expanded into its latent possibilities.
6466,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6467,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,The description of an alien character can serve this purpose only very
6468,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,imperfectly; but the presentation of the circumstances in which that
6469,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"character manifests itself will make description unnecessary, since"
6470,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,our instinct will supply all that is requisite for the impersonation.
6471,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,Thus it seems that Aristotle was justified in making the plot the chief
6472,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,element in fiction: for it is by virtue of the plot that the characters
6473,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"live, or, rather, that we live in them, and by virtue of the plot"
6474,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,accordingly that our soul rises to that imaginative activity by which
6475,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,we tend at once to escape from the personal life and to realize its
6476,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"ideal. This idealization is, of course, partial and merely relative to"
6477,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,the particular adventure in which we imagine ourselves engaged. But in
6478,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"some single direction our will finds self-expression, and understands"
6479,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"itself; runs through the career which it ignorantly coveted, and"
6480,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,gathers the fruits and the lesson of that enterprise.
6481,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6482,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"This is the essence of tragedy: the sense of the finished life, of"
6483,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,the will fulfilled and enlightened: that purging of the mind so much
6484,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"debated upon, which relieves us of pent-up energies, transfers our"
6485,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"feelings to a greater object, and thus justifies and entertains our"
6486,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"dumb passions, detaching them at the same time for a moment from their"
6487,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"accidental occasions in our earthly life. An episode, however lurid,"
6488,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"is not a tragedy in this nobler sense, because it does not work itself"
6489,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"out to the end; it pleases without satisfying, or shocks without"
6490,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"enlightening. This enlightenment, I need hardly say, is not a matter"
6491,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,of theory or of moral maxims; the enlightenment by which tragedy is
6492,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,made sublime is a glimpse into the ultimate destinies of our will.
6493,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,This discovery need not be an ethical gain--Macbeth and Othello attain
6494,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"it as much as Brutus and Hamlet--it may serve to accentuate despair,"
6495,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"or cruelty, or indifference, or merely to fill the imagination for"
6496,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,a moment without much affecting the permanent tone of the mind. But
6497,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,without such a glimpse of the goal of a passion the passion has not
6498,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"been adequately read, and the fiction has served to amuse us without"
6499,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,really enlarging the frontiers of our ideal experience. Memory and
6500,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"emotion have been played upon, but imagination has not brought anything"
6501,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,new to the light.
6502,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6503,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"The dramatic situation, however, gives us the environment of a single"
6504,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"passion, of life in one of its particular phases; and although a"
6505,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"passion, like Romeo's love, may seem to devour the whole soul, and"
6506,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"its fortunes may seem to be identical with those of the man, yet much"
6507,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"of the man, and the best part of him, goes by the board in such a"
6508,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"simplification. If Leonardo da Vinci, for example, had met in his youth"
6509,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"with Romeo's fate, his end would have been no more ideally tragic than"
6510,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,if he had died at eighteen of a fever; we should be touched rather by
6511,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"the pathos of what he had missed, than by the sublimity of what he had"
6512,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"experienced. A passion like Romeo's, compared with the ideal scope of"
6513,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"human thought and emotion, is a thin dream, a pathological crisis."
6514,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6515,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"Accordingly Aristophanes, remembering the original religious and"
6516,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"political functions of tragedy, blushes to see upon the boards a"
6517,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"woman in love. And we should readily agree with him, but for two"
6518,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"reasons,--one, that we abstract too much, in our demands upon art, from"
6519,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"nobility of mind, and from the thought of totality and proportion;"
6520,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"the other, that we have learned to look for a symbolic meaning in"
6521,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"detached episodes, and to accept the incidental emotions they cause,"
6522,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"because of their violence and our absorption in them, as in some sense"
6523,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,sacramental and representative of the whole. Thus the picture of an
6524,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"unmeaning passion, of a crime without an issue, does not appear to"
6525,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"our romantic apprehension as the sorry farce it is, but rather as a"
6526,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,true tragedy. Some have lost even the capacity to conceive of a true
6527,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"tragedy, because they have no idea of a cosmic order, of general laws"
6528,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"of life, or of an impersonal religion. They measure the profundity of"
6529,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"feeling by its intensity, not by its justifying relations; and in the"
6530,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"radical disintegration of their spirit, the more they are devoured the"
6531,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,more they fancy themselves fed. But the majority of us retain some
6532,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"sense of a meaning in our joys and sorrows, and even if we cannot"
6533,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"pierce to their ultimate object, we feel that what absorbs us here"
6534,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,and now has a merely borrowed or deputed power; that it is a symbol
6535,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,and foretaste of all reality speaking to the whole soul. At the same
6536,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,time our intelligence is too confused to give us any picture of that
6537,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"reality, and our will too feeble to marshal our disorganized loves into"
6538,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,a religion consistent with itself and harmonious with the comprehended
6539,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"universe. A rational ideal eludes us, and we are the more inclined to"
6540,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,plunge into mysticism.
6541,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6542,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"Nevertheless, the function of poetry, like that of science, can only be"
6543,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,fulfilled by the conception of harmonies that become clearer as they
6544,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,grow richer. As the chance note that comes to be supported by a melody
6545,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"becomes in that melody determinate and necessary, and as the melody,"
6546,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"when woven into a harmony, is explicated in that harmony and fixed"
6547,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"beyond recall; so the single emotion, the fortuitous dream, launched"
6548,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"by the poet into the world of recognizable and immortal forms, looks"
6549,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,in that world for its ideal supports and affinities. It must find them
6550,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,or else be blown back among the ghosts. The highest ideality is the
6551,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,comprehension of the real. Poetry is not at its best when it depicts
6552,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"a further possible experience, but when it initiates us, by feigning"
6553,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"something which as an experience is impossible, into the meaning of the"
6554,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,experience which we have actually had.
6555,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6556,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,The highest example of this kind of poetry is religion; and although
6557,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,disfigured and misunderstood by the simplicity of men who believe in
6558,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,it without being capable of that imaginative interpretation of life
6559,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"in which its truth consists, yet this religion is even then often"
6560,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"beneficent, because it colours life harmoniously with the ideal."
6561,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"Religion may falsely represent the ideal as a reality, but we must"
6562,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"remember that the ideal, if not so represented, would be despised by"
6563,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"the majority of men, who cannot understand that the value of things"
6564,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"is moral, and who therefore attribute to what is moral a natural"
6565,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"existence, thinking thus to vindicate its importance and value. But"
6566,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"value lies in meaning, not in substance; in the ideal which things"
6567,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"approach, not in the energy which they embody."
6568,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6569,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"The highest poetry, then, is not that of the versifiers, but that of"
6570,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"the prophets, or of such poets as interpret verbally the visions"
6571,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,which the prophets have rendered in action and sentiment rather than
6572,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"in adequate words. That the intuitions of religion are poetical, and"
6573,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"that in such intuitions poetry has its ultimate function, are truths"
6574,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,of which both religion and poetry become more conscious the more they
6575,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,advance in refinement and profundity. A crude and superficial theology
6576,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"may confuse God with the thunder, the mountains, the heavenly bodies,"
6577,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,or the whole universe; but when we pass from these easy identifications
6578,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,to a religion that has taken root in history and in the hearts of
6579,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"men, and has come to flower, we find its objects and its dogmas"
6580,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"purely ideal, transparent expressions of moral experience and perfect"
6581,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,counterparts of human needs. The evidence of history or of the senses
6582,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"is left far behind and never thought of; the evidence of the heart, the"
6583,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"value of the idea, are alone regarded."
6584,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6585,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"Take, for instance, the doctrine of transubstantiation. A metaphor here"
6586,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"is the basis of a dogma, because the dogma rises to the same subtle"
6587,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"region as the metaphor, and gathers its sap from the same soil of"
6588,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"emotion. Religion has here rediscovered its affinity with poetry, and"
6589,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,in insisting on the truth of its mystery it unconsciously vindicates
6590,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"the ideality of its truth. Under the accidents of bread and wine lies,"
6591,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"says the dogma, the substance of Christ's body, blood, and divinity."
6592,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"What is that but to treat facts as an appearance, and their ideal"
6593,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"import as a reality? And to do this is the very essence of poetry, for"
6594,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,which everything visible is a sacrament--an outward sign of that inward
6595,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,grace for which the soul is thirsting.
6596,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6597,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"In this same manner, where poetry rises from its elementary and"
6598,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"detached expressions in rhythm, euphuism, characterization, and"
6599,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"story-telling, and comes to the consciousness of its highest function,"
6600,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"that of portraying the ideals of experience and destiny, then the"
6601,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"poet becomes aware that he is essentially a prophet, and either"
6602,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"devotes himself, like Homer or Dante, to the loving expression of"
6603,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"the religion that exists, or like Lucretius or Wordsworth, to the"
6604,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,heralding of one which he believes to be possible. Such poets are
6605,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"aware of their highest mission; others, whatever the energy of their"
6606,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"genius, have not conceived their ultimate function as poets. They have"
6607,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"been willing to leave their world ugly as a whole, after stuffing it"
6608,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"with a sufficient profusion of beauties. Their contemporaries, their"
6609,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"fellow-countrymen for many generations, may not perceive this defect,"
6610,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,because they are naturally even less able than the poet himself to
6611,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"understand the necessity of so large a harmony. If he is short-sighted,"
6612,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"they are blind, and his poetic world may seem to them sublime in its"
6613,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"significance, because it may suggest some partial lifting of their"
6614,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,daily burdens and some partial idealization of their incoherent
6615,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,thoughts.
6616,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6617,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,Such insensibility to the highest poetry is no more extraordinary than
6618,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,the corresponding indifference to the highest religion; nobility and
6619,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"excellence, however, are not dependent on the suffrage of half-baked"
6620,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"men, but on the original disposition of the clay and the potter; I mean"
6621,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,on the conditions of the art and the ideal capacities of human nature.
6622,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"Just as a note is better than a noise because, its beats being regular,"
6623,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"the ear and brain can react with pleasure on that regularity, so all"
6624,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,the stages of harmony are better than the confusion out of which they
6625,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"come, because the soul that perceives that harmony welcomes it as the"
6626,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,fulfilment of her natural ends. The Pythagoreans were therefore right
6627,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"when they made number the essence of the knowable world, and Plato was"
6628,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,right when he said harmony was the first condition of the highest good.
6629,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,The good man is a poet whose syllables are deeds and make a harmony in
6630,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"Nature. The poet is a rebuilder of the imagination, to make a harmony"
6631,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,in that. And he is not a complete poet if his whole imagination is not
6632,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,attuned and his whole experience composed into a single symphony.
6633,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6634,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"For his complete equipment, then, it is necessary, in the first place,"
6635,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"that he sing; that his voice be pure and well pitched, and that his"
6636,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"numbers flow; then, at a higher stage, his images must fit with one"
6637,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"another; he must be euphuistic, colouring his thoughts with many"
6638,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"reflected lights of memory and suggestion, so that their harmony may"
6639,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"be rich and profound; again, at a higher stage, he must be sensuous and"
6640,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"free, that is, he must build up his world with the primary elements of"
6641,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"experience, not with the conventions of common sense or intelligence;"
6642,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"he must draw the whole soul into his harmonies, even if in doing so"
6643,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,he disintegrates the partial systematizations of experience made
6644,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"by abstract science in the categories of prose. But finally, this"
6645,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,disintegration must not leave the poet weltering in a chaos of sense
6646,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,and passion; it must be merely the ploughing of the ground before a
6647,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"new harvest, the kneading of the clay before the modelling of a more"
6648,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,perfect form. The expression of emotion should be rationalized by
6649,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,derivation from character and by reference to the real objects that
6650,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"arouse it--to Nature, to history, and to the universe of truth; the"
6651,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"experience imagined should be conceived as a destiny, governed by"
6652,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"principles, and issuing in the discipline and enlightenment of the"
6653,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,will. In this way alone can poetry become an interpretation of life and
6654,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"not merely an irrelevant excursion into the realm of fancy, multiplying"
6655,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"oar images without purpose, and distracting us from our business"
6656,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,without spiritual gain.
6657,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6658,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"If we may then define poetry, not in the formal sense of giving the"
6659,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"minimum of what may be called by that name, but in the ideal sense"
6660,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,of determining the goal which it approaches and the achievement in
6661,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"which all its principles would be fulfilled, we may say that poetry is"
6662,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"metrical and euphuistic discourse, expressing thought which is both"
6663,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,sensuous and ideal.
6664,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6665,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,Such is poetry as a literary form; but if we drop the limitation to
6666,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"verbal expression, and think of poetry as that subtle fire and inward"
6667,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,light which seems at times to shine through the world and to touch the
6668,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"images in our minds with ineffable beauty, then poetry is a momentary"
6669,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"harmony in the soul amid stagnation or conflict,--a glimpse of the"
6670,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,divine and an incitation to a religious life.
6671,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6672,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"Religion is poetry become the guide of life, poetry substituted"
6673,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,for science or supervening upon it as an approach to the highest
6674,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"reality. Poetry is religion allowed to drift, left without points of"
6675,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,application in conduct and without an expression in worship and dogma;
6676,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,it is religion without practical efficacy and without metaphysical
6677,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"illusion. The ground of this abstractness of poetry, however, is"
6678,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,usually only its narrow scope; a poet who plays with an idea for half
6679,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"an hour, or constructs a character to which he gives no profound"
6680,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"moral significance, forgets his own thought, or remembers it only as"
6681,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"a fiction of his leisure, because he has not dug his well deep enough"
6682,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,to tap the subterraneous springs of his own life. But when the poet
6683,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,enlarges his theatre and puts into his rhapsodies the true visions
6684,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"of his people and of his soul, his poetry is the consecration of his"
6685,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"deepest convictions, and contains the whole truth of his religion. What"
6686,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,the religion of the vulgar adds to the poet's is simply the inertia
6687,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"of their limited apprehension, which takes literally what he meant"
6688,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"ideally, and degrades into a false extension of this world on its own"
6689,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,level what in his mind was a true interpretation of it upon a moral
6690,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,plane.
6691,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,
6692,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"This higher plane is the sphere of significant imagination, of relevant"
6693,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"fiction, of idealism become the interpretation of the reality it"
6694,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,leaves behind. Poetry raised to its highest power is then identical
6695,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,with religion grasped in its inmost truth; at their point of union
6696,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"both reach their utmost purity and beneficence, for then poetry loses"
6697,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,"its frivolity and ceases to demoralize, while religion surrenders its"
6698,THE ELEMENTS AND FUNCTION OF POETRY,illusions and ceases to deceive.
