93,THE SECRET DAY,
94,THE SECRET DAY,"My yesterday has gone, has gone and left me tired,"
95,THE SECRET DAY,And now to-morrow comes and beats upon the door;
96,THE SECRET DAY,"So I have built To-day, the day that I desired,"
97,THE SECRET DAY,"Lest joy come not again, lest peace return no more,"
98,THE SECRET DAY,Lest comfort come no more.
99,THE SECRET DAY,
100,THE SECRET DAY,"So I have built To-day, a proud and perfect day,"
101,THE SECRET DAY,And I have built the towers of cliffs upon the sands;
102,THE SECRET DAY,The foxgloves and the gorse I planted on my way;
103,THE SECRET DAY,"The thyme, the velvet thyme, grew up beneath my hands,"
104,THE SECRET DAY,Grew pink beneath my hands.
105,THE SECRET DAY,
106,THE SECRET DAY,"So I have built To-day, more precious than a dream;"
107,THE SECRET DAY,And I have painted peace upon the sky above;
108,THE SECRET DAY,"And I have made immense and misty seas, that seem"
109,THE SECRET DAY,"More kind to me than life, more fair to me than love--"
110,THE SECRET DAY,More beautiful than love.
111,THE SECRET DAY,
112,THE SECRET DAY,And I have built a house--a house upon the brink
113,THE SECRET DAY,Of high and twisted cliffs; the sea's low singing fills it;
114,THE SECRET DAY,"And there my Secret Friend abides, and there I think"
115,THE SECRET DAY,I'll hide my heart away before to-morrow kills it--
116,THE SECRET DAY,A cold to-morrow kills it.
117,THE SECRET DAY,
118,THE SECRET DAY,"Yes, I have built To-day, a wall against To-morrow,"
119,THE SECRET DAY,"So let To-morrow knock--I shall not be afraid,"
120,THE SECRET DAY,"For none shall give me death, and none shall give me sorrow,"
121,THE SECRET DAY,And none shall spoil this darling day that I have made.
122,THE SECRET DAY,No storm shall stir my sea. No night but mine shall shade
123,THE SECRET DAY,This day that I have made.

132,SONG,By which my fate may find me:
133,SONG,From that dim place where I was born
134,SONG,Those footprints run behind me.
135,SONG,"Uncertain was the trail I left,"
136,SONG,"For--oh, the way was stormy;"
137,SONG,But now this splendid sea has cleft
138,SONG,My journey from before me.

140,SONG,"Three things the sea shall never end,"
141,SONG,Three things shall mock its power:
142,SONG,"My singing soul, my Secret Friend,"
143,SONG,"And this, my perfect hour."
144,SONG,And you shall seek me till you reach
145,SONG,"The tangled tide advancing,"
146,SONG,And you shall find upon the beach
147,SONG,"The traces of my dancing,"
148,SONG,And in the air the happy speech
149,SONG,Of Secret Friends romancing.

157,THE ORCHARD,I will repent me of my ways;

160,THE ORCHARD,Beneath a flow'ring cherry.
161,THE ORCHARD,
162,THE ORCHARD,Between a pear and a cherry tree

176,THE ORCHARD,
177,THE ORCHARD,"_Ah, let me not grow old. Ah, let"
178,THE ORCHARD,"Me not grow old, and falter"
179,THE ORCHARD,"In my delusion, or forget"
180,THE ORCHARD,My heart was once an altar.
181,THE ORCHARD,Let me still think myself a star
182,THE ORCHARD,With these my rays about me;
183,THE ORCHARD,Pretend these green perspectives are
184,THE ORCHARD,All purposeless without me._
185,THE ORCHARD,
186,THE ORCHARD,"_Ah, bid the sun stand still. Ah, bid"
187,THE ORCHARD,"The coming night retire,"
188,THE ORCHARD,And all the good I ever did
189,THE ORCHARD,Shall feed your altar fire;
190,THE ORCHARD,"The hour shall stand and sing your praise,"
191,THE ORCHARD,"The minute shall adore you,"
192,THE ORCHARD,And my ten thousand unborn days
193,THE ORCHARD,I'll sacrifice before you._
194,THE ORCHARD,
195,THE ORCHARD,"_Gods of great joy, and little grief,"
196,THE ORCHARD,See--I will wear as token
197,THE ORCHARD,A pear leaf and a cherry leaf
198,THE ORCHARD,Until this pledge be broken_....
199,THE ORCHARD,
200,THE ORCHARD,Between a pear and a cherry tree
201,THE ORCHARD,A cold hand touched my shoulder--
202,THE ORCHARD,"_Ah, my false gods have forsaken me,"
203,THE ORCHARD,I am a minute older_.
