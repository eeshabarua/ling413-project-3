19,SCENE I,_The wife and the mother spinning_ 
20,SCENE I,THE WIFE (_sings_) 
21,SCENE I,"Love, it is dark among your roses, The face of the moon is turned away, The nightingale is silent and lonely; Lean from your window a little way!-- "
22,SCENE I,"Lean but a little way towards me, Out of the window where jasmines twine, Open the lattice, softly, slowly, Till the light of your eyes shall gladden mine. "
23,SCENE I,"Love, it is dark among your roses; And how, since the nightingales are fled, Can I tell your heart how my heart is lowly, To touch the ground where your sandals tread? "
24,SCENE I,"This is your garden; these your flowers; These stars have seen you; these dews have known; And now your eyes and your smile you give me-- Give me your love, and be all mine own! "
25,THE MOTHER,THE MOTHER 
26,THE MOTHER,"Sing that again, the music soothes my ear. "
27,THE WIFE,THE WIFE 
28,THE WIFE,"My husband made it for me ere we wed, And sang it in my garden; I arose And leaned down to him, and my fingers gave To all his kisses.  Ah! those days were sweet. "
29,THE MOTHER,THE MOTHER 
30,THE MOTHER,Not sweet now? 
31,THE WIFE,THE WIFE 
32,THE WIFE,"I am happy in his love And thank God for it, nay, propitiate With vows and offering; I fear a wrath Called down on too great happiness; I fear-- I know not what--Oh, I possess a gift So rare and precious, that, like men who go Laden with rubies, I am grown suspect Of all the earth and heaven, feel the stars Peer covetously on me.  Every hour That he is from my side a cloud of woe Settles upon me like a swarm of bees. Ah, is it possible that we can sin In happiness, against a jealous God? "
33,THE MOTHER,THE MOTHER 
34,THE MOTHER,"Nay, nay, these foolish thoughts! your wits are strayed With too much brooding: let me bind afresh The knot of scarlet lilies in your hair; They fade already, for the sun is high Towards the noon: Ah, child, what waits for you But love, and yet more love, and happiness, And children of delight, and in old age Respect of all the peoples, and at last Death in his arms and burial in peace? Still do you tremble, what is it you fear? "
35,THE WIFE,THE WIFE 
36,THE WIFE,"Can you not feel a something in the air, A warning, or a presence, or the weight Of some unguessed-at horror, that, like dust Impalpable and deadly, clings and kills? There is some terror--'tis my heart that speaks And warns me--ah! would God indeed, your son, (My love and husband) had another father Than that celestial being.  This it is That puts eternal sadness on his brow, And shade within his eyes I cannot lift, Even with kisses; 'tis the angel nature That makes him sit spell-woven in a trance, Chin in his hand, and eyes on vacancy, And lips all bare of love, the while his soul Struggles against the bonds of finity. "
37,THE MOTHER,THE MOTHER 
38,THE MOTHER,"Ah, how you love him! "
39,THE WIFE,THE WIFE 
40,THE WIFE,"More because of it, This kingdom infinite I cannot know Though loving him. "
41,THE MOTHER,THE MOTHER 
42,THE MOTHER,Alas! so did I love. 
43,THE WIFE,THE WIFE 
44,THE WIFE,Tell me of love. 
45,THE MOTHER,THE MOTHER 
46,THE MOTHER,"Belovéd, what should I tell That his lips have not taught you? "
47,THE WIFE,THE WIFE 
48,THE WIFE,"Tell of yours; So that I may compare your flowers with mine, Your doubts and times of joy, and how arose The sudden and sweet passion in your heart; Did the world burst forth, like a flower from bud, All suddenly in beauty, when you met? "
49,THE MOTHER,THE MOTHER 
50,THE MOTHER,"Ah, how your words have wakened memory, And bitter-sweet, like love itself, it is. "
51,THE WIFE,THE WIFE 
52,THE WIFE,The first time that you met? 
53,THE MOTHER,THE MOTHER 
54,THE MOTHER,"Ah, that first time! It was a night of gods, a night of love. The earth was still beneath a summer sky So thickly sown with stars, that it appeared A vase of ebon in a silver shroud; No breath there stirred, the hot air seemed to hang In heavy folds, like silken tapestry, Clinging, caressing; all the birds were still, No nightingale with her ecstatic pain Transfixed the silence; earth was dead asleep, Sunk in a scented languor; every flower Steamed all its odour forth, as it would pour Its soul before the mystery of love. "
55,THE MOTHER,"And I into the night had stolen forth, Oppressed, with pain or joy, I knew not which, Knew only that the blood throughout my veins Did run like liquid fire, head to foot I tingled with sensation, all my hair Stirred, as with separate life within itself; And as I plucked the flowers and wove them in, Purple and waxen, languorously sweet, They seemed anticipation of a touch Should make each thread of hair become a bird, Fluttering with outstretched wings.  From off my breast I flung my garment back; the soft air wooed Like sleepy lips ere love is yet awake. Then, as I lingered in the dusky depths, All flower-shadowed, blacker than the night, Blacker than shadows cast by palace walls Upon a moonlit night, there, in that web Of close-knit darkness, suddenly there came The wonder unto me, the god, my love-- Within mine ears there was a silver silence, And in my heart a golden burst of song, The darkness burned around me, with a light Born from the other worlds, and there he stood, Radiant, godlike, purple were his wings And splashed with fire, purply-black his hair And crowned with stars for flowers; in his eyes My soul sank into passion and was drowned. "
56,CHORUS,CHORUS 
57,CHORUS,"Oh, what a pair of birds, Hidden among the leaves! He a god and she a maid, Deathless lips on mortal laid; (Nothing death retrieves.) "
58,CHORUS,"There a son of God And child of mortal seed Met and kissed as love with love; Oh the leaves were thick above, No stars saw the deed. "
59,CHORUS,"No stars, but the eye of God? Ah, perchance He saw How a god to mortal prayed And the fatal compact made 'Gainst eternal law. "
60,CHORUS,"Veiled and still the night. So, a fount of tears Springs at first unseen, unguessed, Till at last the flood confessed Gushes down the years. "
61,CHORUS,"Son of a son of God And the daughter of men too frail! Union of the nature's twain? Only sorrow and want and pain, Striving without avail; "
62,CHORUS,"Desire for wings of a god Tied to the will of a man; Memory of a boundless space, (Where stars and spheres their dance enlace) With the threescore human span "
63,CHORUS,"Hung like a bridge, in the gulf Of God's eternity. Oh a mind to know and a heart to crave Beyond the horizon of the grave To the bounds of infinity! "
64,CHORUS,"Yet ever Fate compels This infinite desire To match with cramped and finite brain; And all of heaven earth may gain Is smoke, where should be fire. "
65,SCENE II,SCENE II 
66,THE SEEKER,THE SEEKER 
67,THE SEEKER,"The air is heavy, all the winds are still So that my own breath hangs about my head Like incense o'er an altar.  Now the earth Lies in a swoon, and all the flowers droop Weighting their stems, ranged in their brazen pots Without the house: the very petals lie Like languid limbs relaxed; this crimson rose Looks as if blood-steeped, almost to my sense Smells of the same, the lilies are like death. There is a taint of sickness in the air Through all the noonday light--like fever chill In fever burning,--and the sky is brass; The very tinkle of the fountain spray Is dead and tuneless, even the fresh springs Have lost their freshness, run from off my hands In drops of lead, and all my spirit seems Weighed and confined with fetters of decay. Because I have loved beauty more than most And striven to pluck out the heart of it; Because I have such sense of lovely things That I can pour my soul in thankfulness Before a leaf God makes to grow aright, A unit of perfection; 'tis ordained Because I love most still I most must lack Love's satisfaction, quietude of soul-- Still must I find such void disparity Between the false and true, and yet they grow Together, intermingled; true is false Itself, by sometime seeming, who shall find The point where false and true are reconciled? "
68,THE SEEKER,"The very flower that we stoop to smell Grows from a dunghill, look but in its roots, And what obscene and hideous blind life Goes teeming; sickened then we shrink aback From rose's velvet petals.  So the soul Holds best and meanest in a common cup. Yet must there be a law in things that are Seemingly lawless, purify the sight And truth must surely then be visible, Disparity made clear; the eye of God Sees good in everything, thereto I strive, To see with God's own vision, be more clear In speech, than God, to asking human hearts. Then is the tangle straightened, and the world Lies in perspective, as before me lie, Traced through the shimmering heat, the palaces, Towers and temples, gardens and granaries, Of this fair City, melting far away Into the sunlight-flooded hills at last. "
69,THE SEEKER,"Yet must I sit here for a little while, Where many columns make a heavy gloom, And with the trickle from the water-jars Of unfresh water, cheat myself awhile With thought of evening freshness.  Oh my soul Is wearier than my body with the toil, It aches with length of watching.  I have strained My spiritual eyes to catch a glimpse of dawn And nothing seen but blackness.  Let me rest As rest the quiet dead from doubt and toil; Like silver feathers from the wings of God Sleep fans my senses---- "
70,THE SEEKER,[_He sleeps._ 
71,THE CHORUS,THE CHORUS 
72,THE CHORUS,"Sleep, and forget, forget the aching toil, The disappointments, and the long delays, The watches of the night-time and the morn, The lonely hours, unrewarded days; Sleep, and forget. "
73,THE CHORUS,"In death we all are equal, great and small Brought to the common level of the dust; There is no glory that survives the years, Nay, nay, alike we shall be as we must; Sleep and forget. "
74,THE CHORUS,"In sleep we are omnipotent as gods, Beyond our furthest wish we can attain, Unfettered by the chain of circumstance; Sleep then; or waking, turn and pray again A little more to sleep and to forget. "
75,SCENE III,SCENE III 
76,SCENE III,_Enter the_ MOTHER _to the_ WIFE 
77,THE MOTHER,THE MOTHER 
78,THE MOTHER,"Ah me, your fears have settled on my heart; I fear the very day, there is a strange Portentous look o'er all the earth, my hand Stretched in the sunlight seems to throw no shade As if the natural laws had all stood still-- I breathe as in a nightmare, breath oppressed; I start at every sound, but fear no sound So much as stillness, which descends on us Like a great mantle choking out our hearts. "
79,THE WIFE,THE WIFE 
80,THE WIFE,"Give me your hand, what is it makes you fear And shiver like plane trees before the rain? "
81,THE MOTHER,THE MOTHER 
82,THE MOTHER,"As I lay in the shadow of the court During the noonday fierceness, watched the rays Chequered between the lattice window work, And listened to the fountain in the grove Of orange trees go singing to itself-- Behold, all suddenly before me stood My lover-god, the angel ever dear, And radiant as that first night years ago, There stood he; where the marble touched his feet It glowed translucent like a sunlit gem, The perfume of his hair had made me swoon Had not his eyes compelled me.  Grave he looked, Where gravity in such a beauteous thing Could find occasion, and his voice was low And troubled, warning me.  ""Let not your son Tempt God too far, He will not brook affront Though son of mine should dare it; be assured The secret of this riddle universe Shall ne'er be known on earth, man was not made For too much knowledge, mankind ceases then When man too much aspires.  Speak to him Lest he should bring destruction on your head And on the world.""  Thus spoke he, nothing more, And ere my eyes could hold him he was gone. "
83,THE WIFE,THE WIFE 
84,THE WIFE,"Ah, let us go in to my husband then And warn him quickly. "
85,THE MOTHER,THE MOTHER 
86,THE MOTHER,"I have warned, alas! And he has heard with the unheeding smile One gives to children's prattle.  ""Now at last The hours bear fruit, and shall I hold my hand,"" He answered, ""for your vision?  I have waited, Now is the time when hope is justified; Truth dawns, not even God Himself can stand Between the light and me and shadow it."" "
87,THE WIFE,THE WIFE 
88,THE WIFE,Ah God! ah God! to whom shall be appeal? 
89,THE MOTHER,THE MOTHER 
90,THE MOTHER,Look where he comes. 
91,THE WIFE,THE WIFE 
92,THE WIFE,With what an air fulfilled. 
93,THE WIFE,"_Enter the_ SEEKER AFTER TRUTH, _inspired_ "
94,THE SEEKER,THE SEEKER 
95,THE SEEKER,"Now do I stand upon the very brink Of my desire; as a soul released And purified by passing through the rays Of white Eternity, I view the world. Now am I all at peace; the heart that yearns In bitter loneliness through midnight hours Yet cannot voice its longing, brain that weaves Its subtle web around the central thought Yet never can absorb it; and this form, The visible pride of body, all complete Are one in union; the body knows Its uses and its worths and has no fear, The heart no more is empty, I have found Eternal love to fill it, and no more Gropes the blind brain for the Great Definite. Away from me, my people, lest the sight Of loving faces blunt the senses keen, Hovering on the pain of a new birth. "
96,THE MOTHER,THE MOTHER 
97,THE MOTHER,"My son, my son, it is not well to tempt The thunders of Jehovah; He who placed Man on this earth, and gave him such a form And such a nature never did intend The form or nature to be changed. "
98,THE SEEKER,THE SEEKER 
99,THE SEEKER,"Enough, Is it not parcel of the nobleness Of His conception thus to place us here Low in the scale; that we, by effort's worth, May reach to Him and equal Him at last? "
100,THE MOTHER,THE MOTHER 
101,THE MOTHER,"Oh man was born for failure, not success, To strive and strive, and evermore to fail, And failing still strive ever; therein lies The nobleness that equals him to God Though linked to insufficient means for God. Why will you hope to change appointed fate? While still in man the sad twi-nature dwells, Godhead and manhood, still as dark and light The eternal war goes on.  It is our lot, Accept it, spare us last catastrophe. "
102,THE WIFE,THE WIFE 
103,THE WIFE,"Alas! alas! you see he marks you not, His eyes are fixed on distance, and his lips Move to the cadence of a song or prayer, I know not which; and ever and anon, His forehead, vivid with the teeming brain, Rests in his hollow hand.  He marks you not; No more than raindrops plashing on a roof, Whereto perhaps one listens for a space And says ""It raineth""--then again to sleep. "
104,THE MOTHER,THE MOTHER 
105,THE MOTHER,"Speak you to him, if he may hear his wife! "
106,THE WIFE,THE WIFE 
107,THE WIFE,"Ah me, my lord, what is it I can say That will excuse the saying?  Words are few When hearts are fullest.  On my wedding night-- Do you remember?--you did take my hand, (As I take yours now) lay your lips on it, (See, here I lay my lips) and all the love Your heart would fain express and tongue could not I read in eyes and kisses, being well skilled In love's translation. "
108,THE SEEKER,THE SEEKER 
109,THE SEEKER,"Who is this that speaks? Your words come through my musing, like the call Of quails across the desert, troubling me With a strange stirring of the peaceful heart. "
110,THE WIFE,THE WIFE 
111,THE WIFE,It was my soul and not my words that called. 
112,THE SEEKER,THE SEEKER 
113,THE SEEKER,My hand is wet with tears. 
114,THE WIFE,THE WIFE 
115,THE WIFE,They are my prayers. 
116,THE SEEKER,THE SEEKER 
117,THE SEEKER,"Why do you weep when all the world should be Poised on the outspread wings of happiness? Ah! just a little moment loose your hold, While strips my soul for last and fiercest struggle That gives us victory. "
118,THE WIFE,THE WIFE 
119,THE WIFE,"Nay cease, ah cease. Why must you venture to the wrath of God For a mere idle fancy?  Is not love, My love, and youth and joy enough for you? Roses are beautiful to bind one's brow, Why must one grasp at stars?  Ah, if my tears, Barren as dew that falls upon the sand, Cannot incline you to forgetfulness Of all save love, you are inexorable, You love me not. "
120,THE SEEKER,THE SEEKER 
121,THE SEEKER,I make an end of tears. 
122,THE WIFE,THE WIFE 
123,THE WIFE,"Nay, rather tears enough to drown the world "
124,THE MOTHER,THE MOTHER 
125,THE MOTHER,"Again, he lapses in his trance. "
126,THE WIFE,THE WIFE 
127,THE WIFE,"Ah me, I can no more, we wait on God's event. "
128,THE SEEKER,THE SEEKER 
129,THE SEEKER,"There have been summer nights so exquisite The soul in me did pant with pain, And with its efforts vain To grasp the beauty of the infinite; When 'twixt my senses and the silent stars The world of forms was purged away, And all creation lay Intense, eternal, without bounds or bars; And all my yearning soul Reached up to, strove for, failed to grasp that Whole. "
130,THE SEEKER,"Ye who have felt the ache Of visible beauty burning through your brain, And vainly tried to break Through forms of beauty, Beauty to attain; Ye who have felt the weight Of much desire in a little space; God in your narrow brain, and in the face Of mortals the large lineaments of Fate; Ye who have felt the pang, Even in love's most full communion Of the soul's loneliness, which may not hang For all its love, another soul upon; "
131,THE SEEKER,"Draw near, draw near to me now, ye who long Above the common things, For truth approaches us on flaming wings And all life's tangle shall be straightened now, And right shall rise triumphant over wrong, And nought be great or little, weak or strong, But all Creation share in knowledge vast As in design; with neither first nor last. A moment let the waiting heart be dumb, Last silence ere the revelation come-- The truth! the truth! "
132,THE SEEKER,[_He is struck dead._ 
133,THE MOTHER,THE MOTHER 
134,THE MOTHER,"Alas! the Wrath of God Flashing upon us from the angry skies, Ah woe! this is destruction. "
135,THE WIFE,THE WIFE 
136,THE WIFE,"Let it be, Since low he lies, struck by a meteor, With truth upon his lips. "
137,THE MOTHER,THE MOTHER 
138,THE MOTHER,"No meteor that; His father, my god-lover, struck him down. "
139,THE WIFE,THE WIFE 
140,THE WIFE,"Since end must be what matter how it come? Here will I sit, his head upon my breast, Where it has lain in sleep, my arms about His kingly body, sit, and wait the end, Mocking at God. "
141,THE CHORUS,THE CHORUS 
142,THE CHORUS,"Alas! alas! alas! The skies are torn, the heavens crash, From pole to pole in terror rending, Mountains against mountains dash, The blinding lightnings blaze and flash, And are shaken the foundations Of the earth, for earth is ending. "
143,THE CHORUS,"Black the air and black the waters, Lifeless the life-giving sun; Woe upon earth's sons and daughters, For the Wrath is now begun. Ah, too late you clamour wildly, Earth is blind, and earth is dumb, You by earth and earth by you Child and mother are undone; Let your cry to God ascend, For from God the terrors come. "
144,THE CHORUS,"Now the father is destroyer And the mother is the grave, Woe is us for God forsakes us And 'tis God alone can save. Oh, a union of destruction Sons of God and nature's daughters, Seed of terror, seed of evil, Nurtured for the hungry waters. "
145,THE CHORUS,"Is there help now?  Oh beseeching, Raise for help impotent hands. While the frenzied winds are roaring, Hound-like loosened from their bands, And the waters' tumult reaching To the stars, where quiet stands God contemplative.  Destruction, 'Tis the uttermost destruction he demands! "
146,THE CHORUS,"Now the waters are uprising And the mountain summits bend, Headlong all the turrets hurling, Towers and temples now descend; All in black confusion whirling Earth and heaven rocking blend, In the waters wildly swirling To annihilation's end. Alas! alas! alas! Neither foothold, hand-hold, safety For the body nor the soul. Cracks the earth, the heavens rend, And the waters of despair consuming roll. "
147,SONNETS,SONNETS 
148,TO J. F. W.,TO J. F. W. 
149,TO J. F. W.,"We've touched the borderland of death and life And come back to the primroses again, And see with different eyes the slanting rain Buffet the larches in a short-lived strife; With different eyes, for we have looked on death, And know what life is for; we felt the hand Of that sad Lady of the other Land, And now, with her released, we draw our breath. "
150,TO J. F. W.,"Life is for gladness, not for mulish days Between the galling shafts of commonplace. See, now, the willow tassels all ablaze Against the background of the windy blue! And in the dusk the crocus glimmers through The footsteps of Persephone we trace. "
151,TO ANDREW CHATTO,TO ANDREW CHATTO 
152,TO ANDREW CHATTO,"It is your thin, ungracious wine that runs Within a year of bottling, to your tongue, The noblest wine is somewhat harsh when young; Lay it aside for many moons and suns, Send it, if so you will, its ""wander-year,"" A-battling with the ocean's storm and strife, Then open it, when ripe are wine and life, And see what mellow sunshine you have there. "
153,TO ANDREW CHATTO,"Here is another year to crown that head So full of years and honour, dear old friend, Whose wisdom makes a constant, quiet balm For tricks and trials of life, whose age doth blend Young-heartedness with philosophic calm, And sunshine on this generation shed. "
154,NOVEMBER,NOVEMBER 
155,NOVEMBER,"There is a gleam of sunshine on the earth After so many weary days of rain, A break of yellowing clouds, which offers plain The sun's veiled disc (a very shadow-birth, But still the sun, with sun's November worth); The sky is of a Turner lived again, Such colours through the misty greyness gain They almost seem to touch with spring the earth. "
156,NOVEMBER,"How should we not be glad, when this one day Out of the saddest of all months, appears Suddenly beautiful?  A single ray Of sunlight strikes through cloud, and clears The whole drear countryside of grey; So may one word dispel a cloud of tears. "
157,TO A ROBIN IN DECEMBER,TO A ROBIN IN DECEMBER 
158,TO A ROBIN IN DECEMBER,"In Paradise there is no sweeter song Than that thin music that the robin makes On short December afternoons, and takes The winter woods, with utterance frail, yet strong; Till all the barren fields, and ruined brakes, The flowerless gardens, and the hedges bare Dream of the spring, and all the rainy air Seems soft and mellow as the summer lakes. "
159,TO A ROBIN IN DECEMBER,"More precious than the treasures of the East, (Guarded by silver-footed antelope,) Or all the nightingales that haunt the grove Of Persian gardens; silver pipe of hope! That Nature gives us when her gifts are least, Sing to our hearts, oh, little voice of love. "
160,A JANUARY MORNING,A JANUARY MORNING 
161,A JANUARY MORNING,"How strangely shone the crescent of the moon In the grey twilight dawning o'er the sea; A star, that seemed of stars a memory, (As faint as lilies on a sultry noon) Ebbed in the chilly waxing of the morn; The sea was rest in motion; hardly stirred Its waves upon the beach; there was no bird To break its undersong of silence born. "
162,A JANUARY MORNING,"The misty shadows lay upon the trees, Whose colour was but echo of the tone That earth and sky were wrapped in, harmonies Of wedded hue were visible alone, --And over all a breath of memory blown, Of other dawnings upon other seas. "
163,FEBRUARY,FEBRUARY 
164,FEBRUARY,"Can there be aught to touch the sleeping dead To consciousness; can love still call to love Across that dark abyss; can feeling move Dead heart and brain, that once with blood were fed, To stir and quicken in their narrow bed, For that which yet is living?  We believe Such force has love, that it may still retrieve Its heart's Eurydice among the dead. "
165,FEBRUARY,"I shall awake, then, shall awake my soul-- Not when full summer beautifies the earth, But with the first sweet stirring of the sap, Ere yet the fields are green or leaves unroll: I shall but sleep awhile in Nature's lap, To be reborn with February's rebirth. "
166,TO APRIL,TO APRIL 
167,I,I 
168,I,"'Tis not alone the loveliness of spring That makes spring lovely; there's a sense behind Of wonders, deeper than the eye can find In daffodils, or swallows on the wing; A subtler pleasure than the sense can bind When on the dusty roads the rain-drops sing As March turns April, and the hours bring Songs to deaf ears, and beauty to the blind. "
169,I,"April is secret nature's treasure room, Which she unlocks to us who love her well In magic moments; then indeed we see The wonder of all spring-times, from the gloom Of world-beginnings, long ere Adam fell-- And all the beauty of all springs to be. "
170,TO APRIL,TO APRIL 
171,II,II 
172,II,"There will be other days as fair as these Which I shall never see; for other eyes The lyric loveliness of cherry trees Shall bloom milk-white against the windy skies And I not praise them; where upon the stream The faëry tracery of willows lies I shall not see the sunlight's flying gleam, Nor watch the swallows sudden dip and rise. "
173,II,"Most mutable the forms of beauty are, Yet Beauty most eternal and unchanged, Perfect for us, and for posterity Still perfect; yearly is the pageant ranged. And dare we wish that our poor dust should mar The wonder of such immortality? "
174,TO DANIEL MANIN,TO DANIEL MANIN 
175,TO DANIEL MANIN,"If that most noble soul, which, here on earth, Was known as Manin, yet have consciousness Of what is, and what is not, being not less Than here he was, in courage and in worth, Seeing the world whereon we sweat and strive; Shall he not know his Italy, and bless, And in his own heart praise the steadfastness That held him to his purpose when alive? "
176,TO DANIEL MANIN,"Shall he not have reward for all his pain, Who, dying with his incompleted aim, Saw failure only, and the bitter toll Of loved ones lost, and lost, it seemed, in vain? Must not that heart still keep his country's name, Though o'er him all death's waters heave and roll? "

178,TO THE LEADERS OF BOTH PARTIES,January 1910 
179,TO THE LEADERS OF BOTH PARTIES,"""A people's voice, we are a people yet."" --TENNYSON'S _Ode on Death of the Duke of Wellington._ "
180,TO THE LEADERS OF BOTH PARTIES,"Think on your birthright, England!  On that voice Which sounded first the ringing clarion note Of freedom, and the ears of mankind smote With that brave speech, whose hearing does rejoice The angels (in his starry sphere remote Each sitting).  Think upon your past, my land; The heart to wish, the will to dare, the hand To do the right, though round the senses float The Protean shapes of evil.  We have struck To free the slave, against a world in doubt; Have raised the grovelling from their muddy ruck And made them men; our foes once put to rout We give them justice; we have scorned to truck In gold for blood, and fatten on such spoil-- To others be the gain, to us the toil. Oh, once more, England, let that voice ring out! "
181,TO THE LEADERS OF BOTH PARTIES,"Alas! thou now dost hide thy Titan self In a drab's clothing, lies; whilst, false and shrill, Thy people squabble for the dirty pelf Of office, at the hustings; while they fill Our streets with lies, that, from the naked walls, Mouth blatantly upon us, open shame; While throughout Europe goes thy honoured name, Grimacing in a mask of Party brawls. "
182,TO THE LEADERS OF BOTH PARTIES,"Bethink you, Leaders!  How will history place Your name beside her others, if you fight With such-like weapons?  Oh, be bold to face The conflict, tell the truth, as in your sight It does appear, with nothing false or base, --The nation's heart will know to choose aright-- Be brave!  Be true these days!  Will you forget You are our Leaders, we, a people yet? "

184,CONSOLATION,"""Is there a pain to match my pain In all this world of woe; When to and fro on a barren earth My weary footsteps go? When no day's sun shall give me mirth And no stars blessed be; Because my heart goes hungry and lone For one who turns from me?"" "
185,CONSOLATION,"Hear what the voice of all Sorrows saith From out the ages dim: ""As melt the snows your passion goes, And as dew it vanisheth. Take up, take up your burden of woe, Unblenching on your journey go, For man was born to reap and sow That earth might fruitful be."" "
186,CONSOLATION,"""Is there a pain to match my pain, Who watch the small dead face, With the folded lips, and the folded lids And the cheek the dimples grace; Where they will come no more, no more?-- Oh, small soft hands that hold So quietly, in rosy palms, My heart that's dead and cold."" "
187,CONSOLATION,"Hear what the voice of all Sorrows saith: ""Though still the little feet, Though the hands are chill, and the sweet form chill, And gone the childish breath; Take up, take up your burden of woe, For you were born to sorrow so, To bear in anguish, and lose in pain, That earth might be fulfilled."" "
188,CONSOLATION,"""Is there a pain to match my pain Who loved all men on earth, Who saw the Godhead, through the shell That burdened them at birth; Who strove for right, who strove for good, Since love must win at last? --This hour they lead me out to die, With cords they make me fast."" "
189,CONSOLATION,"Hear what the voice of all Sorrows saith: ""They lead you out to die; For the love you gave they will dig your grave, And their thanks to you is death. Take up, take up your burden of woe, And proudly to your scaffold go, For men were born to suffer so, That mankind might be great."" "
190,TAPESTRY,TAPESTRY 
191,TAPESTRY,"God the omnipotent wearied of space, And the void of endless blue, And the light of eternity in His face, And eternity's emptiness round the place That the presence of Godhead knew. "
192,TAPESTRY,"So He wove Him a piece of tapestry O'er all infinity drawn, And out of His brain and its subtlety Were the suns that stand, and the comets that flee, And the paths of the planets born. "
193,TAPESTRY,"No plan too great, no design too small, For the fingers of God the Lord, The joy of invention lived through all, From the orbit curve of the earthly ball To the shell where sound is stored. "
194,TAPESTRY,"And all continued as they were made, Clean cast from Perfection's brain, Not a beam of light from its circle strayed, But the whole the heavenly laws obeyed, --God looked, and wearied again. "
195,TAPESTRY,"So He wove Him a piece of tapestry With fingers thrice refined, And He mingled the threads with subtlety, The threads of our human destiny, And the light with the dark He twined. "
196,TAPESTRY,"For shadow and shine were mingled there, And white was matched with red, And the thread of the silver gleamed more fair For the gloom that, surrounding, made it rare; And God in His wisdom said: "
197,TAPESTRY,"""Of my handiwork but the human soul Can suffer the laws of change, That only errs from my set control, And takes in pleasure, and pays in toll, The whole of its passion's range. "
198,TAPESTRY,"""But who shall judge or who condemn This work that my hands have made, For the thread that here appears a gem, --So have I mingled and twisted them-- Is there the gleam of a blade? "
199,TAPESTRY,"""Nor evil nor good exists for me, As I mingle strand with strand; The past is the visible tapestry, The present I weave, and the destiny Of the future is in my hand. "
200,TAPESTRY,"""And the past and the future both are met In the present's history; For the thread I hold is unbroken yet, And the thing I weave is unguessed at yet, In this human tapestry."" "
201,WISDOM AND YOUTH,WISDOM AND YOUTH 
202,WISDOM AND YOUTH,"In the depths of the forest Merlin dreamed; The shuttle of noon wove light and shade Over the moss and around the trees, And a network among the branches made. "
203,WISDOM AND YOUTH,"He sat with his back against a tree, Grey as himself, and gnarled, and old; The lichen was grey as the ragged beard Over his friezen mantle's fold. "
204,WISDOM AND YOUTH,"Still he sat, like an ancient stone That time has forgotten to wear away-- While streamed the forest's green and gold, Like banners on a windy day. "
205,WISDOM AND YOUTH,"And Merlin watched, as watches a tree, A sombre oak of antiquity, The myriad life that seethes and hums, Around its immobility. "
206,WISDOM AND YOUTH,"Around himself, himself had made A monstrous and a mystic spell, Weblike, wherein he sat and dreamed; --So in its mesh may spider dwell! "
207,WISDOM AND YOUTH,"His silence heard the things that grow In underwood of tangled green; His vision penetrated deep, Beneath the common surface screen; "
208,WISDOM AND YOUTH,"The roots of things were plain to him, He saw the crowded under-earth, Where every life fought ceaselessly, To bring a future life to birth; "
209,WISDOM AND YOUTH,"For him the stirring of the leaves Beneath a listless passing breeze, Spoke with a manifolded tongue From all the thickly growing trees; "
210,WISDOM AND YOUTH,"For him the beetles and the mice Made magic of desires and fears, The bumble bee's slow rhythmic hum Seemed like the passing of the years. "
211,WISDOM AND YOUTH,"And where a curving bramble-branch Lay half in shade and half in light, The universe's giant curves Were all discovered to his sight; "
212,WISDOM AND YOUTH,"All things were all things' complement, For what the oak left unexpressed In line and hue, the silver birch Continued, in completion's quest. "
213,WISDOM AND YOUTH,"There was no moss, nor stone, nor leaf, Nor lingering small drop of dew, But he resolved to harmony, And in the mystic mind-web drew. "
214,WISDOM AND YOUTH,"So sat he, abstract as a god, The greatest wisdom of the world, While on his head the sunshine played, And round his robe the shadows curled. "
215,WISDOM AND YOUTH,"Till, through the forest's green and gold, And through the magic afternoon, --Strange, as moonlit waters are, Sweet, as cowslip-fields in June:-- "
216,WISDOM AND YOUTH,"Oh, summer-footed Vivien came! And through the web of dreaming broke; And on her silver clarion note Of laughter, the great Sage awoke. "
217,WISDOM AND YOUTH,"She sat her down beneath the tree, --Oh! fair her youth his age beside!-- She plucked the boughs to make her shade. She pulled the flowers far and wide, "
218,WISDOM AND YOUTH,"To deck her hair; and while the glades Re-echoed to her laughter gay, She leaned to Merlin, kissing him, And stroked his beard, unkempt and grey. "
219,WISDOM AND YOUTH,"And he forgot the voice of trees, And of the silent undergrowth, To hear her merry lilting song, And watch, reposed in summer sloth, "
220,WISDOM AND YOUTH,"Vivien dance upon the sward, As children dance, alone, at ease; Till breathlessly she cast her down And laid her head upon his knees. "
221,WISDOM AND YOUTH,"And with his hand among her hair The magic of his mind was rent, And captive to her shadowed eyes, Behold! the Master-Thinker went. "

226,A VILLA ON THE BAY OF NAPLES,"""Oh, know you not, fair star of love, The thought of you is like new wine, Or strong sweet air on heights above, For mortal senses too divine----"" (Black was the bay of Naples.) "
227,A VILLA ON THE BAY OF NAPLES,"Her lamp beside the window set The woman, and the light shone out A yellow glimmer in the jet Of darkness, that lay all about The outstretched bay of Naples. "

231,A VILLA ON THE BAY OF NAPLES,"The trouble grew within her eyes, She seemed to feel, as in a dream, The ruling force in love that lies; She veiled the lamplight's yellow gleam From the black bay of Naples. "
232,A VILLA ON THE BAY OF NAPLES,"""Ah me,"" she said, ""you tarry yet, And late and chilly grows the night, To-morrow shall my lamp be set To guide you hither with its light,"" Across the bay of Naples. "
233,A VILLA ON THE BAY OF NAPLES,"""To-morrow then, to-morrow's years. I will be yours, but go to-night."" And dimly through the mist of tears She saw the crescent's line of white, High o'er the bay of Naples. "
234,A VILLA ON THE BAY OF NAPLES,"""To-morrow for to-morrow be! To-night is all I ask and need, I cannot loose love's core,"" said he, ""Once to my hand it has been freed"" (Black was the bay of Naples). "
235,A VILLA ON THE BAY OF NAPLES,"""Nay, death may follow love!  'Tis fit That life being empty, should be cast Carelessly into darkness' pit, Be one with all the life that's past"" (Black was the bay of Naples). "
236,A VILLA ON THE BAY OF NAPLES,"""Only compress the joy of years, Summers and seasons, nights and noons, To these short hours, where there appears, As of a mighty god that swoons, The sea's black arm round Naples. "
237,A VILLA ON THE BAY OF NAPLES,"""Oh, black beneath us are the trees, And black the weary line of hills, With all life's joy, and light, and ease, This room your radiant presence fills"" (Black was the bay of Naples). "
238,A VILLA ON THE BAY OF NAPLES,"""And ah,"" said he, ""I'll give my soul To lie beneath your foot in hell, That you may walk unscorched and whole-- Can other lovers love so well?"" (Black was the bay of Naples). "
239,A VILLA ON THE BAY OF NAPLES,"She took his hand and drew him in. She quenched the lamplight's yellow gleam; The moon was like a sabre thin, The one white thing in all that dream Of black that lay on Naples. "

242,A SONG,"What of the birds and the sun, And the moon-rise behind the trees, To the eyes and ears of one Who neither hears nor sees? "
243,A SONG,"What of the world of love, Its fragrance, and light, and bloom, To the soul that cannot move Out of a loveless room? "
244,A SONG,"Were it better the rose were dead In a black December frost, That no more skies were red, That lovers' ways were lost? "
245,A SONG,"Ah no!  The wood must shrink, Bar closely as you may, And between the shutters' chink Slips in the sunlight's ray. "

249,THE BALLAD OF A SEA-NYMPH,"Where the water meets the sands All alone sat she, Wrung her hair with chilly hands That glimmered mistily. "
250,THE BALLAD OF A SEA-NYMPH,"Phosphorescent were the drips From her hair she wrung, And like moonlight on her lips Were the words she sung. "
251,THE BALLAD OF A SEA-NYMPH,"White she was, as white as foam 'Neath a moonlit sky, And the treasures of her home On her brow did lie. "
252,THE BALLAD OF A SEA-NYMPH,"There he found her, he, a man, Wandering by the sea, And desire through him ran-- Misty-white was she. "
253,THE BALLAD OF A SEA-NYMPH,"There he wooed her, wooed her long, Till, within her eyes, Where were erst moonshine and song, Dawned in slow surprise "
254,THE BALLAD OF A SEA-NYMPH,"Mortal pain and mortal doubt, Shades of misery, And she turned her round about, Facing from the sea. "
255,THE BALLAD OF A SEA-NYMPH,"In his hand her hand she laid, As to land they turned, And her hand of sea-foam made 'Neath his fingers burned. "
256,THE BALLAD OF A SEA-NYMPH,"On they went then, he and she, Walking toward the East; And her sisters of the sea Their bewailing ceased "
257,THE BALLAD OF A SEA-NYMPH,"As it paled towards the dawn, From the light they fled; But she laughed with joy new-born. ""Is this life?"" she said. "
258,THE BALLAD OF A SEA-NYMPH,"There was labour of the day, Dust upon her feet, Scorching of the shadeless way, Clamour of the street; "
259,THE BALLAD OF A SEA-NYMPH,"All a human want and pain, Laughter fraught with tears, Toil, when toil we know is vain, Hope, when hopes are fears; "
260,THE BALLAD OF A SEA-NYMPH,"Till this creature of the sea At the last became Human, in her misery, Joy, and pride, and shame. "

278,IN ARCADIA,"Till suddenly, the glimpse of a face In the forest of Arcadia! In the verdant depths where leaves enlace, And dapple with shadow the body's grace-- And Pan, with a snort, gives the Dryad chase, In the forest of Arcadia. "
279,IN ARCADIA,"She is off, on the nimblest of little feet, In the forest of Arcadia; Light as a bird where the treetops meet, For with sudden terror her pulses beat, And desire has made the old god fleet, In the forest of Arcadia. "
280,IN ARCADIA,"Milk-white down the long green avenues, In the forest of Arcadia, Like a dove she flies, and he pursues, Like a hungry hawk when its prey it views-- --And Zeus, on Olympus, prepares a ruse For the forest of Arcadia. "
281,IN ARCADIA,"Nearer draws Pan, with outstretched hand, In the forest of Arcadia, To grasp her long hair's floating strand; --But Zeus, with Olympian wink, had planned That another form for the girl's should stand In the forest of Arcadia. "

286,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"""And I care not a straw for Austria's wrath, And little of Templars reck; If I lead not this host, by the Holy Ghost, May my head be struck from my neck."" "
287,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"King Richard drank, and swore in his cups --And a mighty man was he-- ""Let the mongrels yap, I care not a rap, I am Richard the Lion,"" quoth he. "
288,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"The news went forth to the King of France And the Dukes of high degree, How Richard had sworn that no man born Should lead the armies but he. "
289,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"The Kings were wroth at King Richard's words That were carried to them that day; ""Does he make a mock of our ancient stock, This king of an hour?"" quoth they. "
290,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"""This bastard son of a bastard sire The standard first would plant On the city's walls when Jerusalem falls; Must we this honour grant? "
291,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"""Not so; if Christ would have Richard lead, Let Christ give grace to his arms. We will stand aside from the battle pride And the fury of war's alarms. "
292,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"""Our men are sick and outnumbered sore, And words from home reveal That our country cries for our governance wise; We will look to our country's weal. "
293,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"""For we came to fight for a Holy Cause, Not dance to an upstart king; The cause must wait for Richard the Great, For our weapons down we fling."" "
294,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"Breathless and hushed the messengers spoke As they told King Richard the news How the kings were set and the council met, And the kings to fight refuse. "
295,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"Louder than ever laughed the King In the depths of his golden beard. ""God rest my soul, I will reach the goal, And show if Richard's afeared; "
296,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"""I will plant my flag amidst this camp As a token seen of all; Nor Austria's lance, nor the frown of France, Shall make its splendour fall."" "
297,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"So the sultry breezes of Ascalon Saluted the lions three, And Austria frowned from his camping ground, And cursed right bitterly. "
298,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"""Shall this bastard son of a bastard sire Boast he o'erruleth me? By the Holy Cross, be it living loss, This shame shall never be."" "
299,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"So he planted his banner firm and fast, And it floated high and free, On the selfsame mound in the Christian ground Flew eagle and lions three. "

301,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"Richard arose and strode in haste --Oh the banners floated free-- ""Ill eagles fare in the lion's lair, Take down your banner,"" quoth he. "
302,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"But word for word the Archduke gave. He answered, ""Eagles fly; Let the lion keep to the fields and sheep, To the eagle leave the sky."" "
303,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"""Do you give me words?"" cried Richard the King; ""Ho, now, at your words I laugh."" And he tore the flag like a worthless rag, And he wrenched and splintered the staff, "
304,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"And he set his foot on the silken flag, His foot on Austria's fame; With a swordless hip, yet a smiling lip, He mocked the eagle's shame. "
305,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"(Oh, Richard the Lion, woe is me For the sorrow your deed shall bring, For the dungeon walls, and the gloom that falls On the heart of Richard the King; "
306,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"For the long despair of the prison dark, And the traffic in lordly things, When the Austrian sold for an Emperor's gold The son of the English kings.) "
307,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"But Richard laughed in the noonday sun That beats on Palestine. And Leopold turned, while in hate he burned Against Plantagenet's line; "
308,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"He trusted not in his own right arm, But justice cried from France, And France spake fair, but he did not dare Withstand King Richard's glance. "
309,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,Sullenly Austria turned from the Kings And back to his tents went he; And the lions of gold above Richard the bold Floated alone and free.

313,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"Leopold started out of his seat; ""Good be the news indeed! Now quickly bring to me hither the king, He shall sue to me in his need."" "
314,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"Richard the King is before the Duke, Garbed in a mean disguise, Yet kingship claim the mighty frame And the glance of the kingly eyes, "
315,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"And the Jove-like head with its close-cut hair, And the flowing golden beard; No rags can hide the huge limbs' pride, In kingly cradle reared. "
316,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"Gay, and kingly, and debonair The Lion-hearted stood. ""Fair come to land, by this right hand, Your welcome shall be good."" "
317,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"""Fair thanks to you, our cousin the Duke,"" Said Richard, no whit beguiled; ""I thought not to prove the worth of your love When I entered your land,"" he smiled. "
318,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"""Being in haste to return to my land, I passed in this disguise, For I would not stay the rich display Your ducal bounty supplies."" "
319,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"Leopold snarled like an angry wolf. ""How came you hither?"" said he; ""No choice of mine, but by rule divine,"" --Said Richard--""I came by sea, "
320,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"""Travelling in haste from Palestine To assure me England's throne; But a storm arose, and my fears suppose That I was saved alone."" "
321,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"""Now bind his hands,"" cried Leopold, ""For he comes as a spy, I see."" The King's eyes blazed in wrath amazed, ""A ducal greeting,"" quoth he. "
322,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"""These bonds are unfitting, Duke Leopold, Both mine and your degree, Nor consorts my fame with a spying name, In your throat let your own words be."" "
323,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"Amazed were they all at Richard's taunts, But he smiled with easy pride. ""Now what prevents that my fury vents Itself?"" the Austrian cried. "
324,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"""Now what prevents that I kill you straight And your corpse to the ravens fling? 'Twere easy to say you were ocean's prey."" ""But you dare not,"" said Richard the King. "
325,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"Leopold turned to his feudal lords, Who stood in wondering; ""Now prison me straight this runagate,"" Said he, ""let us lodge this King!"" "
326,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"They have taken Richard the Lion-heart And fettered him fast and sure, In a narrow cell they have chained him well With chains that shall endure. "
327,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"And even Richard's stout heart fails When he hears the great doors clang, And he knows at last that they have him fast, Whose fame through Europe rang. "
328,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"""Oh, what prevents the crafty Duke From poison or secret knife, For no one knows that Richard goes In disguise, in fear of his life; "
329,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"""My brother John will well believe That I was drowned at sea; Nay, he scarce will ask, but will take the task Of kingship gleefully; "

331,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"Many a weary week and month Must darken prison walls; And the King's eye dims, and his mighty limbs Waste, as the leaf that falls. "
332,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"And his face is blanched, and sorrow sits Carven upon his brow, And his right arm slacks for the battle-axe, The warlike field to plough. "
333,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"And yet and anon comes Leopold His captive lord to see, And revenge to taste, as he sees him waste, ""How fares the Lion?"" cries he. "
334,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"""Cousinly questioned,"" says the King, And kingly flashes his eye; ""Let the hog beware of the lion's lair, Though the lion couchant lie."" "
335,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"And then gives back Duke Leopold, And his laugh has a hollow ring; Once more he goes, and the shadows close Round the head and the heart of the King. "
336,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"Then word comes suddenly, flying fast, ""Masters, the King is found!"" And from distant lands the poet stands At last upon English ground. "
337,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"""I have found him, Blondel de Nesle! As I wandered, harp in hand, Through breadth and length of Austria's strength, I saw a tower stand, "
338,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"""And nearer drew, I knew not why, Till I heard a man's voice sing With something of skill, and my heart stood still-- 'Twas the voice of Richard the King, "
339,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"""Singing a fitte that we both had made Once in a banquet hall, When his heart was light, of a captive knight Who out upon Fate did call. "

341,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"""So I struck my harp and sang once more Of a minstrel wandering far, Till he reached the strand of a distant land Where trusty yeomen are, "

343,A BALLAD OF KING RICHARD,"""And Richard sang from his mighty throat 'Oh Blondel, blessed be thou, Thy star of birth makes glad the earth, Thy wit shall save me now. "

349,IN THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW,"What can death render us commensurate With what it takes away; the voice of birds On sweet spring mornings, and the face of spring; And lush long grass around the browsing herds; And shadows on the distant hills the flying rain-clouds fling? "
350,IN THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW,"What is there brighter in the world to come Than white-winged sea-gulls, flashing in the sun Above the blue Atlantic; what more free, Yet what more stable, than those white wings, strung All motionless, against a wind that whips the racing sea? "
351,IN THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW,"Yea, and if these things yet may be the soul's-- The summer moon above the garden flowers Dew-drenched, and the slow song of nightingales-- Yea, and if all these after death be ours, More beauty yet, and peace from strife, yet still the debt prevails. "
352,IN THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW,"For what can ever give us back again The dear, familiar things of every day; The loved and common language that we share; The trivial pleasures; and, when children play, Their laughter, and the touch of hands; and jests; and common care? "

359,EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS,"""Mr. Presland appears to be following in the footsteps of Schiller.... Considered generally, Mr. Presland's drama is a fine piece of work. Excellent in its presentation of character, impressive in sentiment, and dignified in metre, it lacks none of the greater qualities of the historical drama....""--_Scotsman._ "
360,EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS,"""The author remains as simple and dignified in style as in his treatment of the tragedy of 'Joan of Arc.'  There is no painful straining after effect.  Act V. is really powerful.""--_Evening Standard_. "
361,EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS,"""Mr. Presland gives promise of becoming one of the most successful living writers of poetic drama.  His 'Joan of Arc' we have reason to remember, his 'Queen Mary' is no less striking.  There is no Swinburnian welter of poetry here, but a very dramatically presented study of a very baffling woman.  It would be difficult for anyone to cavil at the poet's presentation of the time....  Nothing could be finer, from a dramatic point of view, than her acting after the murder of Rizzio....  The last act is a splendid bit of work; the savagery of the street song and the last speech of Mary before signing her abdication are equally dramatic and equally poetic on very diverse lines.  The play is altogether noteworthy.""--_Glasgow Herald_. "
362,EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS,"""... It would, in our estimation, be a decided acquisition to any actor-manager who could arrange with the author to allow him to produce it....  Space does not permit us to deal with it here as we would like to do, or as it deserves, but we with pleasure commend it to our readers in the most emphatic way....""--_Road_. "
363,EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS,"""... 'Mary Queen of Scots,' a work in which he equals and even exceeds his marked success in dramatizing a theme from the history of the heroic Maid of Orleans....  Its progress is well planned, and it proceeds with spirit, several of the scenes being splendidly dramatic. As literature the play is sustained at a high level in strong nervous verse....  The characters are firmly drawn and lifelike....""--_Liverpool Daily Post_. "

368,EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS,EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS 
369,EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS,"""An excellent drama....  The verse is always flexible, and at the right moment rises into the atmosphere of poetry in which Shakespeare moves with such freedom....  Joan is the soul and centre of the play, and the author has done nobly by her.  We catch, as we read, some of the infection that fell upon men's souls from her presence ... which simply means that Mr. Presland has realised his historical characters so well as to make them seem living....  What we have written is sufficient to show with what dramatic truth and poetic sympathy the dramatist has approached his great subject, and with what success he has handled it.""--_Glasgow Herald_. "
370,EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS,"""Mr. Presland has put some excellent workmanship into this new dramatic picture of the Maid of Orleans....  The action never flags.  The verse is fluid, natural, yet dignified, and adapts itself easily to the varying requirements of the situations....  A play which leaves in the reader's mind a picture that grows upon him.  One forgets everything but Joan, and that not because of any lack of proportion in the composition, but because of the naturalness and force of her beautiful character.""--_Bibliophile_. "
371,EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS,"""At once good drama and good poetry....  The well-known story is deftly treated.  The verse is easy and vigorous--above all, it is dramatic.""--_Sheffield Daily Telegraph_. "
372,EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS,"""Mr. Presland's play shows how impressive Joan of Arc may be made as the central figure in a 'history.' ... Written with faithful adherence to Shakespearean traditions of form, it follows out in an interesting sequence of scenes the several stages in the career of the Maid of Orleans....  The piece is all the more impressive because it does not bring in any invented theatrical love interest, or anything of that sort, to confuse the simple lines of the accepted story.""--_Scotsman_. "
373,EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS,"""Written in language which will commend itself to all educated people, who will certainly not only be entertained, but instructed thereby. The author has done his work excellently in every way.""--_Road_. "

379,EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS,EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS 
380,EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS,"""... The play is genuinely dramatic, and its impressiveness is heightened by the dignity of the blank verse.  There is poetry on every page, but the effects are gained, not by flaunting rhetoric, but by simplicity of language, which is forcible through its truth....  We can only advise those who love English verse to read this play; they will see that poetry is still a living thing among us.""--_Oxford Magazine_. "
381,EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS,"""Mr. Presland follows up his dramas 'Joan of Arc' and 'Mary Queen of Scots,' with a picture, at once moving and terrible, of the siege of Venice by the Austrians in 1849....  He has once more proved himself a dramatist of that high poetic order which we have so often been told died out with the eighteenth century.""--_Literary World_. "
382,EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS,"""His new work condenses into four acts of vigorous and flexible blank verse, always animated in movement, and skilfully wrought together into a fine unity of action....  Mr. Presland's Manin is an impressive, pathetic figure, and the play one which cultured readers should follow with unqualified interest.""--_Scotsman_. "
383,EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS,"""... The poetry never clogs the action and the whole play is tense with the struggle in the soul of the hero....  The play thus becomes the tragedy of a city but the triumph of a man, and the interplay of the two ideas is finely wrought out.  It is not all sombre, but even the gayest of its characters throbs to the heart-beat of Italy, and helps to give unity to the drama.""--_Glasgow Herald_. "
384,EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS,"""Written in blank verse, that is both flexible and dramatic, the author gives an effect of spaciousness, combined with tense feeling.""--_Publisher's Circular_. "
385,EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS,"""In the unfolding of the story, Mr. Presland shows much greater genius than he did in either of his two previous dramatic works....  The verse is most flexible, and practically all through he moves with great freedom and reaches real dignity; the action seldom flags, and the whole work is truly dramatic.  Especially might we pick out the last act as extremely powerful.""--_Sheffield Telegraph_. "
386,EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS,"""Throughout this admirable piece of dramatic work there is clear evidence of the author's extraordinary power as a delineator in poetic drama of human character in its many phases.  His 'Joan of Arc' was a work which one could not fail to remember by reason of its striking characteristics; but we are convinced that remembrance of the 'Defence of Venice' will be equally, if not more, indelible.""--_Cape Argus_.
