206,APRIL.,Dreaming of summer and fruit laden mirth.
207,APRIL.,
208,APRIL.,The grey song-sparrows full of spring have sung
209,APRIL.,Their clear thin silvery tunes in leafless trees;
210,APRIL.,"The robin hops, and whistles, and among"

264,APRIL.,Cleaving the cedar shadows and the thin
265,APRIL.,"Mist of grey gnats that cloud the river shore,"

291,AN OCTOBER SUNSET.,"Paying no reverence to the slender queen,"
292,AN OCTOBER SUNSET.,That like a curvèd olive leaf of gold
293,AN OCTOBER SUNSET.,"Hangs low in heaven, rounded toward sun,"

348,III.,"In the still woods, and the hot sun shone down,"
349,III.,Crossed with warm lucent shadows on the brown
350,III.,"Leaf-paven pools, that bubbled dreamily,"

352,III.,Or far away in whispering river meads
353,III.,"And watery marshes where the brooding noon,"

1251,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"Ah, well I question, for as five years go,"
1252,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"How many blessings fall, and how much woe."
1253,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,
1254,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"Aye there they are, nor have they changed their cheer,"
1255,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"The fields, the hut, the leafy mountain brows;"
1256,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,Across the lonely dusk again I hear
1257,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"The loitering bells, the lowing of the cows,"
1258,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"The bleat of many sheep, the stilly rush"
1259,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"Of the low whispering river, and through all,"
1260,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,Soft human tongues that break the deepening hush
1261,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,With faint-heard song or desultory call:
1262,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,Oh comrades hold; the longest reach is past;
1263,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"The stream runs swift, and we are flying fast."
1264,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,
1265,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"The shore, the fields, the cottage just the same,"

1273,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"The homely hearts that never cared to range,"
1274,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,While life's wide fields were filled with rush and change.
1275,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,
1276,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"And where is Jacques, and where is Verginie?"

1282,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"Or have life's changes borne her far from here,"
1283,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"And far from rest, and far from help and home?"
1284,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"Ah comrades, soft, and let us rest awhile,"

1302,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"One long last look, and many a sad adieu,"
1303,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"While eyes can see and heart can feel you yet,"
1304,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"I leave sweet home and sweeter hearts to you,"
1305,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"A prayer for Picaud, one for pale Lisette,"
1306,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"A kiss for Pierre, my little Jacques, and thee,"
1307,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"A sigh for Jeanne, a sob for Verginie."
1308,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,
1309,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"Oh, does she still remember? Is the dream"
1310,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"Now dead, or has she found another mate?"
1311,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"So near, so dear; and ah, so swift the stream;"
1312,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,Even now perhaps it were not yet too late.
1313,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"But oh, what matter; for before the night"
1314,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"Has reached its middle, we have far to go:"
1315,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,"Bend to your paddles, comrades; see, the light"
1316,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,Ebbs off apace; we must not linger so.
1317,BETWEEN THE RAPIDS.,Aye thus it is! Heaven gleams and then is gone

2046,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Speeding three of us, hand in hand,"
2047,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Seeking peace and the bread of pity,"
2048,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,Journeying out of the Umbrian land;
2049,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,
2050,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,Till we saw from the hills in a dazzled coma
2051,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Over the vines that the wind made shiver,"
2052,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Tower on tower, the great city Roma,"
2053,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Palace and temple, and winding river:"
2054,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,
2055,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"And we stood long in a dream and waited,"
2056,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Watching and praying and purified,"
2057,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"And came at last to the walls belated,"
2058,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,Entering in at the eventide:
2059,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,
2060,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"And many met us with song and dancing,"
2061,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Mantled in skins and crowned with flowers,"
2062,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,Waving goblets and torches glancing;
2063,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Faces drunken, that grinned in ours:"
2064,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,
2065,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"And one, that ran in the midst, came near us--"
2066,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"""Crown yourselves for the feast,"" he said,"
2067,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"But we cried out, that the God might hear us,"
2068,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"""Where is Jesus, the living bread?"""
2069,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,
2070,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,And they took us each by the hand with laughter;
2071,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,Their eyes were haggard and red with wine:
2072,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"They haled us on, and we followed after,"
2073,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"""We will show you the new God's shrine."""
2074,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,
2075,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Ah, woe to our tongues, that, forever unsleeping,"
2076,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Harp and uncover the old hot care,"
2077,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"The soothing ash from the embers sweeping,"
2078,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,Wherever the soles of our sad feet fare.
2079,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,
2080,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Ah, we were simple of mind, not knowing,"
2081,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,How dreadful the heart of a man might be;
2082,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,But the knowledge of evil is mighty of growing;
2083,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,Only the deaf and the blind are free.
2084,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,
2085,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,We came to a garden of beauty and pleasure--
2086,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,It was not the way that our own feet chose--
2087,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Where a revel was whirling in many a measure,"
2088,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,And the myriad roar of a great crowd rose;
2089,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,
2090,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,And the midmost round of the garden was reddened
2091,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,With pillars of fire in a great high ring--
2092,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"One look--and our souls forever were deadened,"
2093,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Though our feet yet move, and our dreams yet sting;"
2094,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,
2095,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"For we saw that each was a live man flaming,"
2096,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Limbs that a human mother bore,"
2097,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"And a thing of horror was done, past naming,"
2098,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"And the crowd spun round, and we saw no more."
2099,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,
2100,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"And he that ran in the midst, descrying,"
2101,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Lifted his hand with a foul red sneer,"
2102,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"And smote us each and the other, crying,"
2103,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"""Thus we worship the new God here."
2104,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,
2105,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"""The Cæsar comes, and the people's pæans"
2106,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Hail his name for the new made light,"
2107,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Pitch and the flesh of the Galileans,"
2108,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Torches fit for a Roman night;"""
2109,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,
2110,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"And we fell down to the earth, and sickened,"
2111,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Moaning, three of us, head by head,"
2112,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"""Where is He, whom the good God quickened?"
2113,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Where is Jesus, the living bread?"""
2114,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,
2115,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Yet ever we heard, in the foul mirth turning,"
2116,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Man and woman and child go by,"
2117,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"And ever the yells of the charred men burning,"
2118,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Piercing heavenward, cry on cry;"
2119,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,
2120,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"And we lay there, till the frightful revel"
2121,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,Died in the dawn with a few short moans
2122,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,Of some that knelt in the wan and level
2123,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Shadows, that fell from the blackened bones."
2124,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,
2125,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Numb with horror and sick with pity,"
2126,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"The heart of each as an iron weight,"
2127,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"We crept in the dawn from the awful city,"
2128,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,Journeying out of the seaward gate.
2129,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,
2130,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,The great sun came from the sea before us;
2131,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,A soft wind blew from the scented south;
2132,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,But our eyes knew not of the steps that bore us
2133,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,Down to the ships at the Tiber's mouth;
2134,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,
2135,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"And we prayed then, as we turned our faces"
2136,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Over the sea to the living God,"
2137,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"That our ways might be in the fierce bare places,"
2138,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,Where never the foot of a live man trod:
2139,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,
2140,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,And we set sail in the noon not caring.
2141,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Whither the prow of the dark ship came,"
2142,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,No more over the old ways faring;
2143,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"For the sea was cold, but the land was flame:"
2144,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,
2145,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"And the keen ship sped, and a deadly coma"
2146,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Blotted away from our eyes forever,"
2147,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,"Tower on tower, the great city Roma,"
2148,THE THREE PILGRIMS.,Palace and temple and yellow river.

2156,THE COMING OF WINTER.,Out of the Northland sombre weirds are calling;
2157,THE COMING OF WINTER.,A shadow falleth southward day by day;
2158,THE COMING OF WINTER.,Sad summer's arms grow cold; his fire is falling;
2159,THE COMING OF WINTER.,His feet draw back to give the stern one way.
2160,THE COMING OF WINTER.,
2161,THE COMING OF WINTER.,"It is the voice and shadow of the slayer,"
2162,THE COMING OF WINTER.,"Slayer of loves, sweet world, slayer of dreams;"

2164,THE COMING OF WINTER.,"Make gray thy woods, and darken all thy streams."
2165,THE COMING OF WINTER.,
2166,THE COMING OF WINTER.,"Black grows the river, blacker drifts the eddy:"
2167,THE COMING OF WINTER.,The sky is grey; the woods are cold below:

2177,EASTER EVE.,"Hear me, Brother, gently met;"
2178,EASTER EVE.,"Just a little, turn not yet,"
2179,EASTER EVE.,"Thou shalt laugh, and soon forget:"
2180,EASTER EVE.,Now the midnight draweth near.
2181,EASTER EVE.,I have little more to tell;
2182,EASTER EVE.,"Soon with hollow stroke and knell,"
2183,EASTER EVE.,"Thou shalt count the palace bell,"
2184,EASTER EVE.,Calling that the hour is here.
2185,EASTER EVE.,
2186,EASTER EVE.,"Burdens black and strange to bear,"
2187,EASTER EVE.,"I must tell, and thou must share,"
2188,EASTER EVE.,"Listening with that stony stare,"
2189,EASTER EVE.,Even as many a man before.
2190,EASTER EVE.,Years have lightly come and gone
2191,EASTER EVE.,In their jocund unison.
2192,EASTER EVE.,But the tides of life roll on----
2193,EASTER EVE.,They remember now no more.
2194,EASTER EVE.,
2195,EASTER EVE.,"Once upon a night of glee,"
2196,EASTER EVE.,"In an hour of revelry,"
2197,EASTER EVE.,"As I wandered restlessly,"
2198,EASTER EVE.,"I beheld with burning eye,"
2199,EASTER EVE.,How a pale procession rolled
2200,EASTER EVE.,"Through a quarter quaint and old,"
2201,EASTER EVE.,"With its banners and its gold,"
2202,EASTER EVE.,And the crucifix went by.
2203,EASTER EVE.,
2204,EASTER EVE.,Well I knew that body brave
2205,EASTER EVE.,"That was pierced and hung to save,"
2206,EASTER EVE.,But my flesh was now a grave
2207,EASTER EVE.,For the soul that gnashed within.
2208,EASTER EVE.,"He that they were bearing by,"
2209,EASTER EVE.,"With their banners white and high,"
2210,EASTER EVE.,"He was pure, and foul was I,"
2211,EASTER EVE.,And his whiteness mocked my sin.
2212,EASTER EVE.,
2213,EASTER EVE.,"Ah, meseemed that even he,"
2214,EASTER EVE.,"Would not wait to look on me,"
2215,EASTER EVE.,"In my years and misery,"
2216,EASTER EVE.,Things that he alone could heal.
2217,EASTER EVE.,In mine eyes I felt the flame
2218,EASTER EVE.,"Of a rage that nought could tame,"
2219,EASTER EVE.,"And I cried and cursed his name,"
2220,EASTER EVE.,Till my brain began to reel.
2221,EASTER EVE.,
2222,EASTER EVE.,"In a moment I was 'ware,"
2223,EASTER EVE.,"How that many watching there,"
2224,EASTER EVE.,"Fearfully with blanch and stare,"
2225,EASTER EVE.,"Crossed themselves, and shrank away;"
2226,EASTER EVE.,"Then upon my reeling mind,"
2227,EASTER EVE.,"Like a sharp blow from behind,"
2228,EASTER EVE.,"Fell the truth, and left me blind,"
2229,EASTER EVE.,"Hopeless now, and all astray."
2230,EASTER EVE.,
2231,EASTER EVE.,"O'er the city wandering wide,"
2232,EASTER EVE.,"Seeking but some place to hide,"
2233,EASTER EVE.,"Where the sounds of mirth had died,"
2234,EASTER EVE.,Through the shaken night I stole;
2235,EASTER EVE.,From the ever-eddying stream
2236,EASTER EVE.,Of the crowds that did but seem
2237,EASTER EVE.,Like processions in a dream
2238,EASTER EVE.,To my empty echoing soul.
2239,EASTER EVE.,
2240,EASTER EVE.,Till I came at last alone
2241,EASTER EVE.,"To a hidden street of stone,"
2242,EASTER EVE.,Where the city's monotone
2243,EASTER EVE.,On the silence fell no more.
2244,EASTER EVE.,Then I saw how one in white
2245,EASTER EVE.,"With a footstep mute and light,"
2246,EASTER EVE.,Through the shadow of the night
2247,EASTER EVE.,Like a spirit paced before.
2248,EASTER EVE.,
2249,EASTER EVE.,And a sudden stillness came
2250,EASTER EVE.,"Through my spirit and my frame,"
2251,EASTER EVE.,And a spell without a name
2252,EASTER EVE.,Held me in his mystic track.
2253,EASTER EVE.,"Though his presence seemed so mild,"
2254,EASTER EVE.,"Yet he led me like a child,"
2255,EASTER EVE.,"With a yearning strange and wild,"
2256,EASTER EVE.,That I dared not turn me back.
2257,EASTER EVE.,
2258,EASTER EVE.,"Oh, I could not see his face,"
2259,EASTER EVE.,"Nor behold his utmost grace,"
2260,EASTER EVE.,Yet I might not change my pace
2261,EASTER EVE.,Fastened by a strange belief;
2262,EASTER EVE.,"For his steps were sad and slow,"
2263,EASTER EVE.,"And his hands hung straight below,"
2264,EASTER EVE.,"And his head was bowed, as though"
2265,EASTER EVE.,Pressed by some immortal grief.
2266,EASTER EVE.,
2267,EASTER EVE.,"So I followed, yet not I"
2268,EASTER EVE.,Held alone that company:
2269,EASTER EVE.,Every silent passer-by
2270,EASTER EVE.,Paled and turned and joined with me;
2271,EASTER EVE.,"So we followed still and fleet,"
2272,EASTER EVE.,"While the city street by street,"
2273,EASTER EVE.,Fell behind our rustling feet
2274,EASTER EVE.,Like a deadened memory.
2275,EASTER EVE.,
2276,EASTER EVE.,Where the sound of sin and riot
2277,EASTER EVE.,"Broke upon the night's dim quiet,"
2278,EASTER EVE.,And the solemn bells hung nigh it
2279,EASTER EVE.,Echoed from their looming towers;
2280,EASTER EVE.,"Where the mourners wept alway,"
2281,EASTER EVE.,Watching for the morning grey;
2282,EASTER EVE.,"Where the weary toiler lay,"
2283,EASTER EVE.,Husbanding the niggard hours;
2284,EASTER EVE.,
2285,EASTER EVE.,By the gates where all night long
2286,EASTER EVE.,"Guests in many a joyous throng,"
2287,EASTER EVE.,"With the sound of dance and song,"
2288,EASTER EVE.,Dreamed in golden palaces;
2289,EASTER EVE.,"Still he passed, and door by door"
2290,EASTER EVE.,"Opened with a pale outpour,"
2291,EASTER EVE.,And the revel rose no more
2292,EASTER EVE.,Hushed in deeper phantasies.
2293,EASTER EVE.,
2294,EASTER EVE.,"As we passed, the talk and stir"
2295,EASTER EVE.,Of the quiet wayfarer
2296,EASTER EVE.,And the noisy banqueter
2297,EASTER EVE.,Died upon the midnight dim.
2298,EASTER EVE.,They that reeled in drunken glee
2299,EASTER EVE.,"Shrank upon the trembling knee,"
2300,EASTER EVE.,"And their jests died pallidly,"
2301,EASTER EVE.,As they rose and followed him.
2302,EASTER EVE.,
2303,EASTER EVE.,"From the street and from the hall,"
2304,EASTER EVE.,From the flare of festival
2305,EASTER EVE.,"None that saw him stayed, but all"
2306,EASTER EVE.,Followed where his wonder would:
2307,EASTER EVE.,And our feet at first so few
2308,EASTER EVE.,"Gathered as those white feet drew,"
2309,EASTER EVE.,Till at last our number grew
2310,EASTER EVE.,To a pallid multitude;
2311,EASTER EVE.,
2312,EASTER EVE.,And the hushed and awful beat
2313,EASTER EVE.,Of our pale unnumbered feet
2314,EASTER EVE.,"Made a murmur strange and sweet,"
2315,EASTER EVE.,As we followed evermore.
2316,EASTER EVE.,"Now the night was almost passed,"
2317,EASTER EVE.,"And the dawn was overcast,"
2318,EASTER EVE.,When the stranger stayed at last
2319,EASTER EVE.,At a great cathedral door.
2320,EASTER EVE.,
2321,EASTER EVE.,"Never word the stranger said,"
2322,EASTER EVE.,"But he slowly raised his head,"
2323,EASTER EVE.,And the vast doors openèd
2324,EASTER EVE.,By an unseen hand withdrawn;
2325,EASTER EVE.,"And in silence wave on wave,"
2326,EASTER EVE.,"Like an army from the grave,"
2327,EASTER EVE.,"Up the aisles and up the nave,"
2328,EASTER EVE.,All that spectral crowd rolled on.
2329,EASTER EVE.,
2330,EASTER EVE.,"As I followed close behind,"
2331,EASTER EVE.,Knowledge like an awful wind
2332,EASTER EVE.,Seemed to blow my naked mind
2333,EASTER EVE.,Into darkness black and bare;
2334,EASTER EVE.,"Yet with longing wild and dim,"
2335,EASTER EVE.,"And a terror vast and grim,"
2336,EASTER EVE.,"Nearer still I pressed to him,"
2337,EASTER EVE.,Till I almost touched his hair.
2338,EASTER EVE.,
2339,EASTER EVE.,"From the gloom so strange and eery,"
2340,EASTER EVE.,"From the organ low and dreary,"
2341,EASTER EVE.,"Rose the wailing miserere,"
2342,EASTER EVE.,By mysterious voices sung;
2343,EASTER EVE.,"And a dim light shone, none knew,"
2344,EASTER EVE.,"How it came, or whence it grew,"
2345,EASTER EVE.,From the dusky roof and through
2346,EASTER EVE.,All the solemn spaces flung.
2347,EASTER EVE.,
2348,EASTER EVE.,"But the stranger still passed on,"
2349,EASTER EVE.,"Till he reached the altar stone,"
2350,EASTER EVE.,And with body white and prone
2351,EASTER EVE.,Sunk his forehead to the floor;
2352,EASTER EVE.,"And I saw in my despair,"
2353,EASTER EVE.,"Standing like a spirit there,"
2354,EASTER EVE.,"How his head was bruised and bare,"
2355,EASTER EVE.,"And his hands were clenched before,"
2356,EASTER EVE.,
2357,EASTER EVE.,How his hair was fouled and knit
2358,EASTER EVE.,"With the blood that clotted it,"
2359,EASTER EVE.,Where the prickled thorns had bit
2360,EASTER EVE.,In his crownèd agony;
2361,EASTER EVE.,"In his hands so wan and blue,"
2362,EASTER EVE.,"Leaning out, I saw the two"
2363,EASTER EVE.,"Marks of where the nails pierced through,"
2364,EASTER EVE.,Once on gloomy Calvary.
2365,EASTER EVE.,
2366,EASTER EVE.,Then with trembling throat I owned
2367,EASTER EVE.,"All my dark sin unatoned,"
2368,EASTER EVE.,"Telling it with lips that moaned,"
2369,EASTER EVE.,And methought an echo came
2370,EASTER EVE.,"From the bended crowd below,"
2371,EASTER EVE.,"Each one breathing faint and low,"
2372,EASTER EVE.,Sins that none but he might know:
2373,EASTER EVE.,"""Master I did curse thy name."""
2374,EASTER EVE.,
2375,EASTER EVE.,And I saw him slowly rise
2376,EASTER EVE.,"With his sad unearthly eyes,"
2377,EASTER EVE.,"Meeting mine with meek surprise,"
2378,EASTER EVE.,And a voice came solemnly.
2379,EASTER EVE.,"""Never more on mortal ground"
2380,EASTER EVE.,"For thy soul shall rest be found,"
2381,EASTER EVE.,But when bells at midnight sound
2382,EASTER EVE.,"Thou must rise and come with me."""
2383,EASTER EVE.,
2384,EASTER EVE.,"Then my forehead smote the floor,"
2385,EASTER EVE.,"Swooning, and I knew no more,"
2386,EASTER EVE.,Till I heard the chancel door
2387,EASTER EVE.,Open for the choristers:
2388,EASTER EVE.,"But the stranger's form was gone,"
2389,EASTER EVE.,And the church was dim and lone:
2390,EASTER EVE.,"Through the silence, one by one"
2391,EASTER EVE.,Stole the early worshippers.
2392,EASTER EVE.,
2393,EASTER EVE.,I am ageing now I know;
2394,EASTER EVE.,"That was many years ago,"
2395,EASTER EVE.,Yet or I shall rest below
2396,EASTER EVE.,"In the grave where none intrude,"
2397,EASTER EVE.,"Night by night I roam the street,"
2398,EASTER EVE.,"And that awful form I meet,"
2399,EASTER EVE.,"And I follow pale and fleet,"
2400,EASTER EVE.,With a ghostly multitude.
2401,EASTER EVE.,
2402,EASTER EVE.,"Every night I see his face,"
2403,EASTER EVE.,"With its sad and burdened grace,"
2404,EASTER EVE.,"And the torn and bloody trace,"
2405,EASTER EVE.,That in hands and feet he has.
2406,EASTER EVE.,Once my life was dark and bad;
2407,EASTER EVE.,"Now its days are strange and sad,"
2408,EASTER EVE.,And the people call me mad:
2409,EASTER EVE.,"See, they whisper as they pass."
2410,EASTER EVE.,
2411,EASTER EVE.,Even now the echoes roll
2412,EASTER EVE.,From the swinging bells that toll;
2413,EASTER EVE.,"It is midnight, now my soul"
2414,EASTER EVE.,Hasten; for he glideth by.
2415,EASTER EVE.,"Stranger, 'tis no phantasie:"
2416,EASTER EVE.,Look! my master waits for me
2417,EASTER EVE.,"Mutely, but thou canst not see"
2418,EASTER EVE.,With thy mortal blinded eye.

2424,THE ORGANIST.,
2425,THE ORGANIST.,
2426,THE ORGANIST.,In his dim chapel day by day
2427,THE ORGANIST.,"The organist was wont to play,"
2428,THE ORGANIST.,And please himself with fluted reveries;
2429,THE ORGANIST.,"And all the spirit's joy and strife,"
2430,THE ORGANIST.,"The longing of a tender life,"
2431,THE ORGANIST.,Took sound and form upon the ivory keys;
2432,THE ORGANIST.,"And though he seldom spoke a word,"
2433,THE ORGANIST.,The simple hearts that loved him heard
2434,THE ORGANIST.,His glowing soul in these.
2435,THE ORGANIST.,
2436,THE ORGANIST.,"One day as he was wrapped, a sound"
2437,THE ORGANIST.,Of feet stole near; he turned and found
2438,THE ORGANIST.,A little maid that stood beside him there.
2439,THE ORGANIST.,"She started, and in shrinking-wise"
2440,THE ORGANIST.,Besought him with her liquid eyes
2441,THE ORGANIST.,"And little features, very sweet and spare."
2442,THE ORGANIST.,"""You love the music, child,"" he said,"
2443,THE ORGANIST.,"And laid his hand upon her head,"
2444,THE ORGANIST.,And smoothed her matted hair.
2445,THE ORGANIST.,
2446,THE ORGANIST.,"She answered, ""At the door one day"
2447,THE ORGANIST.,I sat and heard the organ play;
2448,THE ORGANIST.,I did not dare to come inside for fear;
2449,THE ORGANIST.,"But yesterday, a little while,"
2450,THE ORGANIST.,I crept half up the empty aisle
2451,THE ORGANIST.,And heard the music sounding sweet and clear;
2452,THE ORGANIST.,"To-day I thought you would not mind,"
2453,THE ORGANIST.,"For, master dear, your face was kind,"
2454,THE ORGANIST.,"And so I came up here."""

2456,THE ORGANIST.,"""You love the music then,"" he said,"
2457,THE ORGANIST.,"And still he stroked her golden head,"
2458,THE ORGANIST.,And followed out some winding reverie;
2459,THE ORGANIST.,"""And you are poor?"" said he at last;"
2460,THE ORGANIST.,"The maiden nodded, and he passed"
2461,THE ORGANIST.,His hand across his forehead dreamingly;
2462,THE ORGANIST.,"""And will you be my friend?"" he spake,"
2463,THE ORGANIST.,"""And on the organ learn to make"
2464,THE ORGANIST.,"Grand music here with me?"""
2465,THE ORGANIST.,
2466,THE ORGANIST.,And all the little maiden's face
2467,THE ORGANIST.,Was kindled with a grateful grace;
2468,THE ORGANIST.,"""Oh, master, teach me; I will slave for thee!"""
2469,THE ORGANIST.,She cried; and so the child grew dear
2470,THE ORGANIST.,"To him, and slowly year by year"
2471,THE ORGANIST.,He taught her all the organ's majesty;
2472,THE ORGANIST.,And gave her from his slender store
2473,THE ORGANIST.,"Bread and warm clothing, that no more"
2474,THE ORGANIST.,Her cheeks were pinched to see.
2475,THE ORGANIST.,
2476,THE ORGANIST.,And year by year the maiden grew
2477,THE ORGANIST.,"Taller and lovelier, and the hue"
2478,THE ORGANIST.,Deepened upon her tender cheeks untried.
2479,THE ORGANIST.,"Rounder, and queenlier, and more fair"
2480,THE ORGANIST.,"Her form grew, and her golden hair"
2481,THE ORGANIST.,Fell yearly richer at the master's side.
2482,THE ORGANIST.,"In speech and bearing, form and face,"
2483,THE ORGANIST.,"Sweeter and graver, grace by grace,"
2484,THE ORGANIST.,Her beauties multiplied.
2485,THE ORGANIST.,
2486,THE ORGANIST.,And sometimes at his work a glow
2487,THE ORGANIST.,"Would touch him, and he murmured low,"
2488,THE ORGANIST.,"""How beautiful she is?"" and bent his head;"
2489,THE ORGANIST.,And sometimes when the day went by
2490,THE ORGANIST.,"And brought no maiden he would sigh,"
2491,THE ORGANIST.,And lean and listen for her velvet tread;
2492,THE ORGANIST.,"And he would drop his hands and say,"
2493,THE ORGANIST.,"""My music cometh not to-day;"
2494,THE ORGANIST.,"Pray God she be not dead!"""
2495,THE ORGANIST.,
2496,THE ORGANIST.,"So the sweet maiden filled his heart,"
2497,THE ORGANIST.,"And with her growing grew his art,"
2498,THE ORGANIST.,For day by day more wondrously he played.
2499,THE ORGANIST.,"Such heavenly things the master wrought,"
2500,THE ORGANIST.,That in his happy dreams he thought
2501,THE ORGANIST.,The organ's self did love the gold-haired maid:
2502,THE ORGANIST.,"But she, the maiden, never guessed"
2503,THE ORGANIST.,What prayers for her in hours of rest
2504,THE ORGANIST.,The sombre organ prayed.
2505,THE ORGANIST.,
2506,THE ORGANIST.,"At last, one summer morning fair,"
2507,THE ORGANIST.,The maiden came with braided hair
2508,THE ORGANIST.,"And took his hands, and held them eagerly."
2509,THE ORGANIST.,"""To-morrow is my wedding day;"
2510,THE ORGANIST.,"Dear master, bless me that the way"
2511,THE ORGANIST.,"Of life be smooth, not bitter unto me."""
2512,THE ORGANIST.,He stirred not; but the light did go
2513,THE ORGANIST.,"Out of his shrunken cheeks, and oh!"
2514,THE ORGANIST.,His head hung heavily.
2515,THE ORGANIST.,
2516,THE ORGANIST.,"""You love him, then?"" ""I love him well,"""
2517,THE ORGANIST.,"She answered, and a numbness fell"
2518,THE ORGANIST.,Upon his eyes and all his heart that bled.
2519,THE ORGANIST.,"A glory, half a smile, abode"
2520,THE ORGANIST.,Within the maiden's eyes and glowed
2521,THE ORGANIST.,"Upon her parted lips. The master said,"
2522,THE ORGANIST.,"""God bless and bless thee, little maid,"
2523,THE ORGANIST.,"With peace and long delight,"" and laid"
2524,THE ORGANIST.,His hands upon her head.
2525,THE ORGANIST.,
2526,THE ORGANIST.,And she was gone; and all that day
2527,THE ORGANIST.,"The hours crept up and slipped away,"
2528,THE ORGANIST.,"And he sat still, as moveless as a stone."
2529,THE ORGANIST.,"The night came down, with quiet stars,"
2530,THE ORGANIST.,And darkened him: in colored bars
2531,THE ORGANIST.,Along the shadowy aisle the moonlight shone.
2532,THE ORGANIST.,And then the master woke and passed
2533,THE ORGANIST.,"His hands across the keys at last,"
2534,THE ORGANIST.,And made the organ moan.
2535,THE ORGANIST.,
2536,THE ORGANIST.,"The organ shook, the music wept;"
2537,THE ORGANIST.,For sometimes like a wail it crept
2538,THE ORGANIST.,In broken moanings down the shadows drear;
2539,THE ORGANIST.,"And otherwhiles the sound did swell,"
2540,THE ORGANIST.,And like a sudden tempest fell
2541,THE ORGANIST.,Through all the windows wonderful and clear.
2542,THE ORGANIST.,"The people gathered from the street,"
2543,THE ORGANIST.,And filled the chapel seat by seat--
2544,THE ORGANIST.,They could not choose but hear.
2545,THE ORGANIST.,
2546,THE ORGANIST.,"And there they sat till dawning light,"
2547,THE ORGANIST.,"Nor ever stirred for awe. ""To-night,"
2548,THE ORGANIST.,"The master hath a noble mood,"" they said."
2549,THE ORGANIST.,But on a sudden ceased the sound:
2550,THE ORGANIST.,"Like ghosts the people gathered round,"
2551,THE ORGANIST.,And on the keys they found his fallen head.
2552,THE ORGANIST.,The silent organ had received
2553,THE ORGANIST.,"The master's broken heart relieved,"
2554,THE ORGANIST.,And he was white and dead.
2555,THE ORGANIST.,
2556,THE ORGANIST.,

2562,I.,I.
2563,I.,
2564,I.,In Nino's chamber not a sound intrudes
2565,I.,"Upon the midnight's tingling silentness,"
2566,I.,"Where Nino sits before his book and broods,"
2567,I.,"Thin and brow-burdened with some fine distress,"
2568,I.,Some gloom that hangs about his mournful moods
2569,I.,His weary bearing and neglected dress:
2570,I.,"So sad he sits, nor ever turns a leaf--"
2571,I.,Sorrow's pale miser o'er his hoard of grief.
2572,I.,
2573,I.,
2574,II.,II.
2575,II.,
2576,II.,"Young Nino and Leonora, they had met"
2577,II.,"Once at a revel by some lover's chance,"
2578,II.,And they were young with hearts already set
2579,II.,"To tender thoughts, attunèd to romance;"
2580,II.,Wherefore it seemed they never could forget
2581,II.,"That winning touch, that one bewildering glance:"
2582,II.,"But found at last a shelter safe and sweet,"
2583,II.,Where trembling hearts and longing hands might meet.
2584,II.,
2585,II.,
2586,III.,III.
2587,III.,
2588,III.,"Ah, sweet their dreams, and sweet the life they led"
2589,III.,"With that great love that was their bosoms' all,"
2590,III.,Yet ever shadowed by some circling dread
2591,III.,"It gloomed at moments deep and tragical,"
2592,III.,And so for many a month they seemed to tread
2593,III.,"With fluttering hearts, whatever might befall,"
2594,III.,"Half glad, half sad, their sweet and secret way"
2595,III.,To the soft tune of some old lover's lay.
2596,III.,
2597,III.,
2598,IV.,IV.
2599,IV.,
2600,IV.,"But she is gone, alas he knows not where,"
2601,IV.,Or how his life that tender gift should lose:
2602,IV.,"Indeed his love was ever full of care,"
2603,IV.,"The hasty joys and griefs of him who woos,"
2604,IV.,"Where sweet success is neighbour to despair,"
2605,IV.,With stolen looks and dangerous interviews:
2606,IV.,"But one long week she came not, nor the next,"
2607,IV.,And so he wandered here and there perplext;
2608,IV.,
2609,IV.,
2610,V.,V.
2611,V.,
2612,V.,Nor evermore she came. Full many days
2613,V.,"He sought her at their trysts, devised deep schemes"
2614,V.,"To lure her back, and fell on subtle ways"
2615,V.,To win some word of her; but all his dreams
2616,V.,"Vanished like smoke, and then in sore amaze"
2617,V.,"From town to town, as one that crazèd seems,"
2618,V.,"He wandered, following in unhappy quest"
2619,V.,Uncertain clues that ended like the rest.
2620,V.,
2621,V.,
2622,VI.,VI.
2623,VI.,
2624,VI.,"And now this midnight, as he sits forlorn,"
2625,VI.,The printed page for him no meaning bears;
2626,VI.,With every word some torturing dream is born;
2627,VI.,And every thought is like a step that scares
2628,VI.,Old memories up to make him weep and mourn.
2629,VI.,"He cannot turn but from their latchless lairs,"
2630,VI.,The weary shadows of his lost delight
2631,VI.,Rise up like dusk birds through the lonely night.
2632,VI.,
2633,VI.,
2634,VII.,VII.
2635,VII.,
2636,VII.,"And still with questions vain he probes his grief,"
2637,VII.,"Till thought is wearied out, and dreams grow dim."
2638,VII.,"What bitter chance, what woe beyond belief"
2639,VII.,Could keep his lady's heart so hid from him?
2640,VII.,"Or was her love indeed but light and brief,"
2641,VII.,"A passing thought, a moment's dreamy whim?"
2642,VII.,"Aye there it stings, the woe that never sleeps:"
2643,VII.,"Poor Nino leans upon his book, and weeps."
2644,VII.,
2645,VII.,
2646,VIII.,VIII.
2647,VIII.,
2648,VIII.,Until at length the sudden grief that shook
2649,VIII.,"His piercèd bosom like a gust is past,"
2650,VIII.,"And laid full weary on the wide-spread book,"
2651,VIII.,His eyes grow dim with slumber light and fast;
2652,VIII.,But scarcely have his dreams had time to look
2653,VIII.,"On lands of kindlier promise, when aghast"
2654,VIII.,"He starts up softly, and in wondering wise"
2655,VIII.,Listens atremble with wide open eyes.
2656,VIII.,
2657,VIII.,
2658,IX.,IX.
2659,IX.,
2660,IX.,What sound was that? Who knocks like one in dread
2661,IX.,With such swift hands upon his outer door?
2662,IX.,Perhaps some beggar driven from his bed
2663,IX.,"By gnawing hunger he can bear no more,"
2664,IX.,"Or questing traveller with confusèd tread,"
2665,IX.,"Straying, bewildered in the midnight hoar."
2666,IX.,"Nino uprises, scared, he knows not how,"
2667,IX.,The dreams still pale about his burdened brow.
2668,IX.,
2669,IX.,
2670,X.,X.
2671,X.,
2672,X.,"The heavy bolt he draws, and unawares"
2673,X.,"A stranger enters with slow steps, unsought,"
2674,X.,"A long robed monk, and in his hand he bears"
2675,X.,A jewelled goblet curiously wrought;
2676,X.,But of his face beneath the cowl he wears
2677,X.,For all his searching Nino seeth nought;
2678,X.,"And slowly past him with long stride he hies,"
2679,X.,While Nino follows with bewildered eyes.
2680,X.,
2681,X.,
2682,XI.,XI.
2683,XI.,
2684,XI.,Straight on he goes with dusky rustling gown.
2685,XI.,"His steps are soft, his hands are white and fine;"
2686,XI.,And still he bears the goblet on whose crown
2687,XI.,A hundred jewels in the lamplight shine;
2688,XI.,And ever from its edges dripping down
2689,XI.,"Falls with dark stain the rich and lustrous wine,"
2690,XI.,Wherefrom through all the chamber's shadowy deeps
2691,XI.,A deadly perfume like a vapour creeps.
2692,XI.,
2693,XI.,
2694,XII.,XII.
2695,XII.,
2696,XII.,And now he sets it down with careful hands
2697,XII.,On the slim table's polished ebony;
2698,XII.,"And for a space as if in dreams he stands,"
2699,XII.,Close hidden in his sombre drapery.
2700,XII.,"""Oh lover, by thy lady's last commands,"
2701,XII.,"I bid thee hearken, for I bear with me"
2702,XII.,A gift to give thee and a tale to tell

2708,XIII.,The stranger's voice falls slow and solemnly.
2709,XIII.,"Tis soft, and rich, and wondrous deep of tone;"
2710,XIII.,"And Nino's face grows white as ivory,"
2711,XIII.,Listening fast-rooted like a shape of stone.
2712,XIII.,"Ah, blessed saints, can such a dark thing be?"
2713,XIII.,"And was it death, and is Leonora gone?"
2714,XIII.,"Oh, love is harsh, and life is frail indeed,"
2715,XIII.,"That gives men joy, and then so makes them bleed."

2718,XIV.,XIV.
2719,XIV.,
2720,XIV.,"""There is the gift I bring""; the stranger's head"

2722,XIV.,"""And now my tongue draws back for very dread,"
2723,XIV.,"Unhappy youth, from what it must not hide."
2724,XIV.,The saddest tale that ever lips have said;
2725,XIV.,"Yet thou must know how sweet Leonora died,"

2734,XV.,The monk continues with his mournful grace:
2735,XV.,"""She told me, Nino, how you often met"
2736,XV.,"In secret, and your plighted loves kept pace"
2737,XV.,"Together, tangled in the self-same net;"
2738,XV.,"Your dream's dark danger and its dread you knew,"

2746,XVI.,Nor ever cared that still above your head
2747,XVI.,The shadow grew; for that your lips were dumb.
2748,XVI.,You knew full keenly you could never wed:
2749,XVI.,'Twas all a dream: the end must surely come;
2750,XVI.,For not on thee her father's eyes were turned

2772,XVIII.,Within one month her bridal hour should be
2773,XVIII.,With Messer Gianni for his power and gold;

2929,XXXI.,And drained her goblet to the very lees.
2930,XXXI.,"'Oh priest, remember, keep thine oath,' she cried,"
2931,XXXI.,And the spent goblet fell against her side.
2932,XXXI.,
2933,XXXI.,
2934,XXXII.,XXXII.
2935,XXXII.,
2936,XXXII.,"""And then she moaned and murmured like a bell:"
2937,XXXII.,"'My Nino, my sweet Nino!' and no more"
2938,XXXII.,"She said, but fluttered like a bird and fell"
2939,XXXII.,Lifeless as marble to the footworn floor;
2940,XXXII.,"And there she lies even now in lonely cell,"
2941,XXXII.,"Poor lady, pale with all the grief she bore,"
2942,XXXII.,"She could not live, and still be true to thee,"
2943,XXXII.,"And so she's gone where no rude hands can be."""
2944,XXXII.,
2945,XXXII.,
2946,XXXIII.,XXXIII.
2947,XXXIII.,
2948,XXXIII.,"The monk's voice pauses like some mournful flute,"
2949,XXXIII.,"Whose pondered closes for sheer sorrow fail,"
2950,XXXIII.,And then with hand that seems as it would suit
2951,XXXIII.,"A soft girl best, it is so light and frail,"
2952,XXXIII.,"He turns half round, and for a moment mute"
2953,XXXIII.,"Points to the goblet, and so ends his tale:"
2954,XXXIII.,"""Mine oath is kept, thy lady's last command;"
2955,XXXIII.,"'Tis but a short hour since it left her hand."""
2956,XXXIII.,
2957,XXXIII.,
2958,XXXIV.,XXXIV.
2959,XXXIV.,
2960,XXXIV.,So ends the stranger: surely no man's tongue
2961,XXXIV.,"Was e'er so soft, or half so sweet, as his."
2962,XXXIV.,"Oft as he listened, Nino's heart had sprung"
2963,XXXIV.,With sudden start as from a spectre's kiss;
2964,XXXIV.,For deep in many a word he deemed had rung
2965,XXXIV.,The liquid fall of some loved emphasis;
2966,XXXIV.,"And so it pierced his sorrow to the core,"
2967,XXXIV.,The ghost of tones that he should hear no more.
2968,XXXIV.,
2969,XXXIV.,
2970,XXXV.,XXXV.
2971,XXXV.,
2972,XXXV.,"But now the tale is ended, and still keeps"
2973,XXXV.,The stranger hidden in his dusky weed;
2974,XXXV.,"And Nino stands, wide-eyed, as one that sleeps,"
2975,XXXV.,And dimly wonders how his heart doth bleed.
2976,XXXV.,"Anon he bends, yet neither moans nor weeps,"
2977,XXXV.,"But hangs atremble, like a broken reed;"
2978,XXXV.,"""Ah! bitter fate, that lured and sold us so,"

2980,XXXV.,
2981,XXXV.,
2982,XXXVI.,XXXVI.
2983,XXXVI.,
2984,XXXVI.,"But even as he moans in such dark mood,"
2985,XXXVI.,His wandering eyes upon the goblet fall.
2986,XXXVI.,"Oh, dreaming heart! Oh, strange ingratitude!"
2987,XXXVI.,"So to forget his lady's lingering call,"
2988,XXXVI.,"Her parting gift, so rich, so crimson-hued,"
2989,XXXVI.,"The lover's draught, that shall be cure for all."
2990,XXXVI.,"He lifts the goblet lightly from its place,"
2991,XXXVI.,"And smiles, and rears it with his courtly grace."
2992,XXXVI.,
2993,XXXVI.,
2994,XXXVII.,XXXVII.
2995,XXXVII.,
2996,XXXVII.,"""Oh, lady sweet, I shall not long delay:"
2997,XXXVII.,This gift of thine shall bring me to thine eyes.
2998,XXXVII.,Sure God will send on no unpardoned way
2999,XXXVII.,"The faithful soul, that at such bidding dies."
3000,XXXVII.,"When thou art gone, I cannot longer stay"
3001,XXXVII.,"To brave this world with all its wrath and lies,"
3002,XXXVII.,Where hands of stone and tongues of dragon's breath
3003,XXXVII.,"Have bruised mine angel to her piteous death."""
3004,XXXVII.,
3005,XXXVII.,
3006,XXXVIII.,XXXVIII.
3007,XXXVIII.,
3008,XXXVIII.,And now the gleaming goblet hath scarce dyed
3009,XXXVIII.,"His lips' thin pallor with its deathly red,"
3010,XXXVIII.,"When Nino starts in wonder, fearful-eyed,"
3011,XXXVIII.,"For, lo! the stranger with outstretchèd head"
3012,XXXVIII.,"Springs at his face one soft and sudden stride,"
3013,XXXVIII.,"And from his hand the deadly cup hath sped,"
3014,XXXVIII.,"Dashed to the ground, and all it's seeded store"
3015,XXXVIII.,Runs out like blood upon the marble floor.

3022,XXXIX.,'Twas all to prove thy heart's deaf constancy
3023,XXXIX.,I brought that cup and told that piteous tale.
3024,XXXIX.,Ah! chains and cells and cruel treachery
3025,XXXIX.,Are weak indeed when women's hearts assail.
3026,XXXIX.,"Art angry, Nino?"" 'Tis no monk that cries,"

3037,XL.,"So trembling fair, so wan, so pallid sweet."
3038,XL.,"Aye, Nino, down like saint upon thy knee,"

3059,XLII.,Am wondrous happy in thy truth confessed.
3060,XLII.,To haggard death indeed thou needst not fly
3061,XLII.,To find the softness of thy lady's breast;

3072,XLIII.,Only this night through every bolt and gin
3073,XLIII.,By cunning stealth I wrought my way at last.
3074,XLIII.,"Straight to thine heart I fled, unfaltering,"

3083,XLIV.,"But half in fear that yet the dream may fly,"
3084,XLIV.,He touches mutely mouth and brow and cheek;
3085,XLIV.,Till in his ear she 'gins to plead and sigh:
3086,XLIV.,"""Dear love, forgive me for that cruel tale,"

3309,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,If dawn should never come.
3310,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,
3311,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,How joyously
3312,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"These hours have gone with all their pictured scenes,"
3313,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,A string of golden beads for memory
3314,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"To finger over in her moods, or stay"
3315,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The hunger of some wakeful hour like this,"
3316,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The flowers, the myrtles, the gay bridal train,"
3317,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The flutes and pensive voices, the white robes,"
3318,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The shower of sweet-meats, and the jovial feast,"
3319,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The bride cakes, and the teeming merriment,"
3320,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Most beautiful of all, most sweet to name,"
3321,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The good Lysippe with her down-cast eyes,"
3322,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Touched with soft fear, half scared at all the noise,"
3323,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Whose tears were ready as her laughter, fresh,"
3324,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,And modest as some pink anemone.
3325,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"How young she looked, and how her smiling lips"
3326,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Betrayed her happiness. Ah, who can tell,"
3327,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"How often, when no watchful eye was near,"
3328,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Her eager fingers, trembling and ashamed,"
3329,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Essayed the apple-pips, or strewed the floor"
3330,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"With broken poppy petals. Next to her,"
3331,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Theron himself the gladest goodliest figure,"
3332,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"His honest face ruddy with health and joy,"
3333,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"And smiling like the Ægean, when the sun"
3334,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Hangs high in heaven, and the freshening wind"
3335,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Comes in from Melos, rippling all its floor:"
3336,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"And there was Manto too, the good old crone,"
3337,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"So dear to children with her store of tales,"
3338,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Warmed with new life: how to her old grey face
3339,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,And withered limbs the very dance of youth
3340,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Seemed to return, and in her aged eyes"
3341,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The waning fire rekindled: little Mæon,"
3342,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"That mischievous satyr with his tipsy wreath,"
3343,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Who kept us laughing at his pranks, and made"
3344,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Old Pyrrho angry. Him too sleep hath bound
3345,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Upon his rough-hewn couch with subtle thong,"
3346,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Crowding his brain with odd fantastic shapes.
3347,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Even in sleep his little limbs, I think,"
3348,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Twitch restlessly, and still his tongue gibes on"
3349,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"With inarticulate murmur. Ah, quaint Mæon!"
3350,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"And Manto, poor old Manto, what dim dreams"
3351,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Of darkly-moving chaos and slow shapes
3352,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Of things that creep encumbered with huge burdens
3353,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Gloom and infest her through these dragging hours,"
3354,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Haunting the wavering soul, so near the grave?"
3355,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,But all things journey to the same quiet end
3356,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"At last, life, joy and every form of motion."
3357,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Nothing stands still. Not least inevitable,"
3358,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The sad recession of this passionate love,"
3359,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Whose panting fires, so soon and with such grief,"
3360,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Burn down to ash.
3361,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,
3362,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Ai! Ai! 'tis a strange madness
3363,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"To give up thought, ambition, liberty,"
3364,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"And all the rooted custom of our days,"
3365,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Even life itself for one all pampering dream,"
3366,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,That withers like those garlands at the door;
3367,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,And yet I have seen many excellent men
3368,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Besotted thus, and some that bore till death,"
3369,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"In the crook'd vision and embittered tongue,"
3370,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The effect of this strange poison, like a scar,"
3371,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"An ineradicable hurt; but Fate,"
3372,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Who deals more wondrously in this disease
3373,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Even than in others, yet doth sometimes will"
3374,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,To make the same thing unto different men
3375,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Evil or good. Was not Demetrios happy,"
3376,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Who wore his fetters with such grace, and spent"
3377,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"On Chione, the Naxian, that shrewd girl,"
3378,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"His fortune and his youth, yet, while she lived,"
3379,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Enjoyed the rich reward? He seemed like one,"
3380,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"That trod on wind, and I remember well,"
3381,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"How when she died in that remorseless plague,"
3382,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"And I alone stood with him at the pyre,"
3383,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,He shook me with his helpless passionate grief.
3384,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"And honest Agathon, the married man,"
3385,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Whose boyish fondness for his pretty wife
3386,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"We smiled at, and yet envied; at the close"
3387,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Of each day's labour how he posted home,"
3388,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"And thence no bait, however plumed, could draw him."
3389,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"We laughed, but envied him. How sweet she looked"
3390,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"That morning at the Dyonisia,"
3391,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"With her rare eyes and modest girlish grace,"
3392,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Leading her two small children by the palm.
3393,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"I too might marry, if the faithful gods"
3394,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Would promise me such joy as Agathon's.
3395,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Perhaps some day--but no, I am not one"
3396,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"To clip my wings, and wind about my feet"
3397,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"A net, whose self-made meshes are as stern"
3398,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,As they are soft. To me is ever present
3399,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The outer world with its untravelled paths,"
3400,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The wanderer's dream, the itch to see new things."
3401,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"A single tie could never bind me fast,"
3402,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"For life, this joyous, busy, ever-changing life,"
3403,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Is only dear to me with liberty,"
3404,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,With space of earth for feet to travel in
3405,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,And space of mind for thought.
3406,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,
3407,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Not so for all;
3408,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"To most men life is but a common thing,"
3409,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The hours a sort of coin to barter with,"
3410,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Whose worth is reckoned by the sum they buy
3411,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"In gold, or power, or pleasure; each short day"
3412,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,That brings not these deemed fruitless as dry sand.
3413,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Their lives are but a blind activity,"
3414,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"And death to them is but the end of motion,"
3415,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Grey children who have madly eat and drunk,"
3416,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Won the high seats or filled their chests with gold.
3417,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,And yet for all their years have never seen
3418,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The picture of their lives, or how life looks"
3419,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"To him who hath the deep uneager eye,"
3420,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"How sweet and large and beautiful it was,"
3421,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,How strange the part they played. Like him who sits
3422,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Beneath some mighty tree, with half-closed eyes,"
3423,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"At ease rejoicing in its murmurous shade,"
3424,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Yet never once awakes from his dull dream
3425,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"To mark with curious joy the kingly trunk,"
3426,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The sweeping boughs and tower of leaves that gave it,"
3427,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Even so the most of men; they take the gift,"
3428,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,And care not for the giver. Strange indeed
3429,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Are they, and pitiable beyond measure,"
3430,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Who, thus unmindful of their wretchedness,"
3431,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Crowd at life's bountiful gates, like fattening beggars,"
3432,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Greedy and blind. For see how rich a thing
3433,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Life is to him who sees, to whom each hour"
3434,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Brings some fresh wonder to be brooded on,"
3435,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Adds some new group or studied history
3436,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"To that wrought sculpture, that our watchful dreams"
3437,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Cast up upon the broad expanse of time,"
3438,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"As in a never-finished frieze, not less"
3439,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,The little things that most men pass unmarked
3440,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Than those that shake mankind. Happy is he,"
3441,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Who, as a watcher, stands apart from life,"
3442,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"From all life and his own, and thus from all,"
3443,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Each thought, each deed, and each hour's brief event,"
3444,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Draws the full beauty, sucks its meaning dry."
3445,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,For him this life shall be a tranquil joy.
3446,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,He shall be quiet and free. To him shall come
3447,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"No gnawing hunger for the coarser touch,"
3448,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,No mad ambition with its fateful grasp;
3449,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Sorrow itself shall sway him like a dream.
3450,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,
3451,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,How full life is; how many memories
3452,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Flash, and shine out, when thought is sharply stirred;"
3453,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"How the mind works, when once the wheels are loosed,"
3454,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"How nimbly, with what swift activity."
3455,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"I think, 'tis strange that men should ever sleep,"
3456,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"There are so many things to think upon,"
3457,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"So many deeds, so many thoughts to weigh,"
3458,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"To pierce, and plumb them to the silent depth."
3459,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Yet in that thought I do rebuke myself,"
3460,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Too little given to probe the inner heart,"
3461,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"But rather wont, with the luxurious eye,"
3462,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"To catch from life it's outer loveliness,"
3463,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Such things as do but store the joyous memory
3464,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"With food for solace rather than for thought,"
3465,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Like light-lined figures on a painted jar.
3466,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"I wonder where Euktemon is to-night,"
3467,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Euktemon with his rough and fitful talk,"
3468,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,His moody gesture and defiant stride;
3469,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"How strange, how bleak and unapproachable;"
3470,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,And yet I liked him from the first. How soon
3471,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"We know our friends, through all disguise of mood,"
3472,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Discerning by a subtle touch of spirit
3473,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,The honest heart within. Euktemon's glance
3474,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Betrayed him with it's gusty friendliness,"
3475,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Flashing at moments from the clouded brow,"
3476,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Like brave warm sunshine, and his laughter too,"
3477,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"So rare, so sudden, so contagious,"
3478,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"How at some merry scene, some well-told tale,"
3479,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Or swift invention of the wingèd wit,"
3480,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"It broke like thunderous water, rolling out"
3481,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,In shaken peals on the delighted ear.
3482,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Yet no man would have dreamed, who saw us two"
3483,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"That first grey morning on the pier at Crete,"
3484,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,That friendship could have forged thus easily
3485,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,A bond so subtle and so sure between us;
3486,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"He, gloomy and austere; I, full of thought"
3487,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"As he, yet in an adverse mood, at ease,"
3488,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Lifting with lighter hands the lids of life,"
3489,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Untortured by its riddles; he, whose smiles"
3490,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Were rare and sudden as the autumn sun;
3491,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"I, to whom smiles are ever near the lip."
3492,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,And yet I think he loved me too; my mood
3493,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Was not unpleasant to him, though I know"
3494,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,At times I teased him with my flickering talk.
3495,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,How self-immured he was; for all our converse
3496,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"I gathered little, little, of his life,"
3497,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"A bitter trial to me, who love to learn"
3498,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The changes of men's outer circumstance,"
3499,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The strokes that fate has shaped them with, and so,"
3500,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Fitting to these their present speech and favour,"
3501,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Discern the thought within. From him I gleaned
3502,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Nothing. At the least word, however guarded,"
3503,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,That sought to try the fastenings of his life
3504,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"With prying hands, how mute and dark he grew,"
3505,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,And like the cautious tortoise at a touch
3506,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Drew in beneath his shell.
3507,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,
3508,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"But ah, how sweet"
3509,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The memory of that long untroubled day,"
3510,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"To me so joyous, and so free from care,"
3511,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Spent as I love on foot, our first together,"
3512,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,When fate and the reluctant sea at last
3513,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Had given us safely to dry land; the tramp
3514,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"From grey Mycenæ by the pass to Corinth,"
3515,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The smooth white road, the soft caressing air,"
3516,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Full of the scent of blossoms, the clear sky,"
3517,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Strewn lightly with the little tardy clouds,"
3518,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Old Helios' scattered flock, the low-branched oaks"
3519,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"And fountained resting-places, the cool nooks,"
3520,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Where eyes less darkened with life's use than mine
3521,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Perchance had caught the Naiads in their dreams,"
3522,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Or won white glimpses of their flying heels.
3523,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,How light our feet were: with what rhythmic strides
3524,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"We left the long blue gulf behind us, sown"
3525,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Far out with snowy sails; and how our hearts
3526,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Rose with the growth of morning, till we reached"
3527,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,That moss-hung fountain on the hillside near
3528,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Cleonæ, where the dark anemones"
3529,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Cover the ground, and make it red like fire."
3530,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Could ever grief, I wonder, or fixed care,"
3531,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Or even the lingering twilight of old age,"
3532,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Divest for me such memories of their sweet?
3533,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Even Euktemon's obdurate mood broke down.
3534,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The odorous stillness, the serene bright air,"
3535,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The leafy shadows, the warm blossoming earth,"
3536,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Drew near with their voluptuous eloquence,"
3537,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"And melted him. Ah, what a talk we had!"
3538,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"How eagerly our nimble tongues ran on,"
3539,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"With linkèd wit, in joyous sympathy."
3540,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Such hours, I think, are better than long years"
3541,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Of brooding loneliness, mind touching mind"
3542,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"To leaping life, and thought sustaining thought,"
3543,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Till even the darkest chambers of grey time,"
3544,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"His ancient seats, and bolted mysteries,"
3545,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Open their hoary doors, and at a look"
3546,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Lay all their treasures bare. How, when our thought"
3547,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Wheeling on ever bolder wings at last
3548,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Grew as it seemed too large for utterance,"
3549,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"We both fell silent, striving to recall"
3550,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,And grasp such things as in our daring mood
3551,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,We had but glimpsed and leaped at; yet how long
3552,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"We studied thus with absent eyes, I know not;"
3553,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Our thought died slowly out; the busy road,"
3554,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The voices of the passers-by, the change"
3555,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Of garb and feature, and the various tongues"
3556,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Absorbed us. Ah, how clearly I recall them!"
3557,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,For in these silent wakeful hours the mind
3558,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Is strangely swift. With what sharp lines
3559,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,The shapes of things that even years have buried
3560,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Shine out upon the rapid memory,"
3561,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Moving and warm like life. I can see now
3562,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The form of that tall peddler, whose strange wares,"
3563,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Outlandish dialect and impudent gait
3564,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Awoke Euktemon's laughter. In mine ear
3565,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Is echoing still the cracking string of gibes,"
3566,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,They flung at one another. I remember too
3567,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,The grey-haired merchant with his bold black eyes
3568,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"And brace of slaves, the old ship captain tanned"
3569,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"With sweeping sea-winds and the pitiless sun,"
3570,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"But best of all that dainty amorous pair,"
3571,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Whose youthful spirit neither heat nor toil
3572,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Could conquer. What a charming group they made?
3573,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The creaking litter and the long brown poles,"
3574,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The sinewy bearers with their cat-like stride,"
3575,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Dripping with sweat, that merry dark-eyed girl,"
3576,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Whose sudden beauty shook us from our dreams,"
3577,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,And chained our eyes. How beautiful she was?
3578,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Half-hid among the gay Miletian cushions,"
3579,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The lovely laughing face, the gracious form,"
3580,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"The fragrant lightly-knotted hair, and eyes"
3581,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Full of the dancing fire of wanton Corinth.
3582,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"That happy stripling, whose delighted feet"
3583,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Swung at her side, whose tongue ran on so gaily,"
3584,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Is it for him alone she wreathes those smiles,"
3585,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"And tunes so musically that flexile voice,"
3586,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Soft as the Lydian flute? Surely his gait
3587,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Proclaimed the lover, and his well-filled girdle"
3588,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Not less the lover's strength. How joyously
3589,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"He strode, unmindful of his ruffled curls,"
3590,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Whose perfumes still went wide upon the wind,"
3591,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"His dust-stained robe unheeded, and the stones"
3592,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Whose ragged edges frayed his delicate shoes.
3593,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"How radiant, how full of hope he was!"
3594,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"What pleasant memories, how many things"
3595,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Rose up again before me, as I lay"
3596,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Half-stretched among the crushed anemones,"
3597,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"And watched them, till a far off jutting ledge"
3598,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Precluded sight, still listening till mine ears"
3599,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Caught the last vanishing murmur of their talk.
3600,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,
3601,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Only a little longer; then we rose
3602,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"With limbs refreshed, and kept a swinging pace"
3603,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Toward Corinth; but our talk, I know not why,"
3604,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Fell for that day. I wonder what there was
3605,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"About those dainty lovers or their speech,"
3606,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,That changed Euktemon's mood; for all the way
3607,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"From high Cleonæ to the city gates,"
3608,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Till sunset found us loitering without aim,"
3609,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Half lost among the dusky-moving crowds,"
3610,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"I could get nothing from him but dark looks,"
3611,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Short answers and the old defiant stride.
3612,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Some memory pricked him. It may be, perchance,"
3613,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"A woman's treachery, some luckless passion,"
3614,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"In former days endured, hath seared his blood,"
3615,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,And dowered him with that cureless bitter humour.
3616,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,To him solitude and the wanderer's life
3617,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"Alone are sweet, the tumults of this world"
3618,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,"A thing unworthy of the wise man's touch,"
3619,AN ATHENIAN REVERIE.,Its joys and sorrows to be met alike
