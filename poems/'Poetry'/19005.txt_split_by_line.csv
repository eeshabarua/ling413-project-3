41,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA
42,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
43,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
44,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Somnolent, vast, inert, the darkness lay"
45,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Waiting for dawn. Across the ocean stirred
46,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"A luminous haze, not light, but whispering light,"
47,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"So softly yet, the islands had not heard."
48,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The mystery of sleep was in the trees
49,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And on the weary stars. A little cry
50,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,That broke the silence seemed a sacrilege.
51,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Then thro' the palm trees glided like a ghost
52,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,A dusky form; the curtain of the dark
53,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Was rent with life, the forest brought forth men."
54,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
55,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Instinct with morning every eye was bright,"
56,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Tho' sleep so lately lay across their lids.
57,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,No sinister intent had called them forth
58,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Upon the shadows. May held out her hands,"
59,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And all the men who dared the dangerous sport
60,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Were faring where the great bonita played,--"
61,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Strong shining fish below the mid sea waves.
62,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Upon the beach beneath the paling moon
63,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The boats were launched. Amid the busy stir
64,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"One man stood idle; as a chief might order,"
65,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,He bade the youths prepare his long canoe.
66,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,With folded arms he gravely watched the rest
67,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And gave them salutation haughtily.
68,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Uhila[1] was he called, and in his veins"
69,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,There ran a slender stream of northern blood.
70,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"He bore upon his old and indolent heart,"
71,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Scarred with the sins of war, a white device."
72,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Taka, daughter of chiefs and Fiji's pride,"
73,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Lily of maidens, was betrothed to him;"
74,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Desirous eyes kinged him with envy's crown.
75,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
76,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,[Footnote 1: The lightning.]
77,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
78,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Scraping across the beach the boats were launched,"
79,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"And as they touched the waves, they seemed to take"
80,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,New shape and dignity with that caress
81,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Of little lapping ripples round the prow.
82,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Uhila led the fleet as one who knew
83,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,His right by reason of his age and skill.
84,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The little isle seemed now a sleeping maid
85,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Kirtled in green, the beach her snowy breast"
86,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Veined with the purple brooks that sought the sea.
87,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Uhila watched it fade below the blue,"
88,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Crouched in the bow, his grizzled chin in hand,"
89,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Taking his ease, while small Kuma, keen-eyed,"
90,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Famed for his daring, paddled lustily."
91,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The dawn had not yet broken, and the soft"
92,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Beautiful haze that veils the birth of day
93,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Hung on the water. Loath to break the peace,"
94,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Men gave their orders in hushed tones, the clean"
95,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Chill of the morning wrapt their naked bodies.
96,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Then, as a slow blush mounts the cheek, a light"
97,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Breathed from the sea, and all the air seemed warm"
98,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"As at the touch of spring, a violet streak,"
99,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"A pale leaf green, a golden, and a rose"
100,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Broke in the sky, and morning was revealed."
101,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"With a shrill cry, young Kuma raised his hand"
102,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And pointed where with dip and shriek and wheel
103,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,A flock of sea birds hovered; all the rest
104,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Echoed the call and bending to the paddle
105,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Shot o'er the waves, for now the fish were gained."
106,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Uhila grasped his rod, and at the stern"
107,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Tossed out the shining hook, with laugh and cheer"
108,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"A glint of silver flashed, then all the air"
109,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Was gemmed with streaming stars. They came from deeps;
110,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,From azure fairer than its mother sky
111,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Clouded with dazzling whitenesses of foam.
112,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Luck to their fishing:
113,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
114,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Now, fair and remote"
115,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,A scattered emerald from a broken chain
116,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Lying below the bending breast of heaven,"
117,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The village had awakened,--once again"
118,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Serene Kambara, island of the south,"
119,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Exhaled its light upon the light of heaven.
120,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The verdure seemed to shine with lucent green,"
121,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The red hibiscus burned with inward flame,"
122,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And in the village happy song and shout
123,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Proclaimed the day was fair. Blue upon blue
124,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The bright waves glittered like a shattered star
125,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Set in the silver crescent of the sand.
126,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The palm trees' plume uplifted dauntlessly
127,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,To call the morning. At the forest's brim
128,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The day was made alive by human flowers,"
129,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Sweet maidens who against the emerald
130,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Showed warm and brown in purest harmony.
131,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The fierce bright flame that is the tropic sea
132,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Burned on their eyes and called them to its heart.
133,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Like eager sea birds they forgot the land,"
134,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"And, happy as the amorous waves, they gave"
135,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Their slim brown bodies to the sea's embrace.
136,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,They found them driftwood and astride they leapt
137,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The feathered breakers, one with daring skill"
138,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Curved her sweet length to lie within the palm
139,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Of a strong wave, and so was brought to shore."
140,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""Taka,"" they cried, ""has beaten us;"" and all,"
141,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Shaking the bright drops from their shining hair,"
142,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"With laugh and song sprang to the beach again,"
143,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Sunning themselves to languor ere they made
144,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Their pretty toilet.
145,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Some had gathered flowers
146,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"In fragrant wreaths, and others brought the grave"
147,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Work of the morning. Yet because the wine--
148,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Sun of the South--gilds even toil, it seemed"
149,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,A poet's pastime. Scarlet beans they threaded
150,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Later to lie about some golden throat.
151,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Deftly they wove fine mats, and deftly twisted"
152,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Bright witchery to adorn themselves, and snare"
153,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Men's eyes. With little songs they pearled the air.
154,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Hush! it is Taka singing:--
155,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
156,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""Far away"
157,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,In a fountain dwelt a maiden;
158,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,When the silver moon was high
159,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"She was glad, but heavy laden"
160,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Was she when its light must die.
161,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Far away.
162,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
163,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""Far away"
164,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Came a stranger brave to love her,"
165,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Loved her when the moon was high;
166,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,When the moon was pale above her
167,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Love grew pale and like to die
168,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Far away.
169,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
170,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""Far away"
171,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,From the fountain's mist he drew her
172,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Happy while the moon was high,"
173,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Waning, fled she, her pursuer"
174,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Held her back, and saw her die"
175,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Far away."""
176,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
177,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""'Tis a sad song for morning,"" cried the maids--"
178,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""And for a bride. Come, Hopa, sing of laughter."""
179,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Hopa sang:--
180,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
181,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""Little brown streams,"
182,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Slim as my fingers,"
183,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Running and laughing
184,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"While the light lingers,"
185,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Have you no dreams,"
186,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Little brown streams?
187,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
188,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""Little brown maidens,"
189,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Laughing and weeping,"
190,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Singing and dancing,"
191,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"All the night sleeping,"
192,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Have you no lovers,"
193,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Little brown maidens?"""
194,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
195,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Afar there sounded in the mellow breeze
196,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The rhythmic movement of the maidens' toil;
197,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Before them on the sand a snowy sheet
198,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Lay spread,--the tapa cloth; tutunga trees"
199,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Yield them their inner bark, and lightly then"
200,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The maidens tap the fibres till they join,"
201,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Made firm with scented gums and bright with dyes,"
202,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"To form a fabric that a bride might choose,"
203,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And this was for a bride. Among the rest
204,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"One maiden shone; a moon beside her stars,"
205,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Taka, the fair. Her father was the chief"
206,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Of this small village. His the splendid store
207,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Of kava bowls for which the isle is famed,"
208,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The shining fish-hooks, fairest of mother of pearl,"
209,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Great mats from ancient days with border rare
210,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Of crimson feathers, cruel tragic spears,"
211,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Sweet unguents, necklaces of pearly shells"
212,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Envied by maidens, and above them all"
213,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Bales of the snowy tapa, made by hands"
214,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Subtle, wise hands of women, over whom"
215,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The earth had long laid flowers.
216,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
217,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,In the land
218,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Where history is but a charming tale
219,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Droned by old men at twilight, future days"
220,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Pleasantly certain as the next repast,"
221,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Where gods and goddesses appear as  birds,"
222,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Trees, plants or moonlight, gently rising tide,"
223,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"And shining girdle of leaves,--all homely things,"
224,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Which hold the people's hearts.--In this fair land
225,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Taka was born. Thro' sixteen years of  moon
226,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And tropic sun she blossomed in the air.
227,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Chilled by no frost, the world unconsciously"
228,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Mirrored her sweetness back to her. The sun
229,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Had kissed her skin to a warm topaz;  rare
230,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"As dusky wealth of Autumn, her sweet breast,"
231,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Gleaming and bare, was hung with ropes of flowers"
232,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Yellow and white, and in her curling hair"
233,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Glimmered the pure gardenia. All the  braves
234,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Wished her for wife, but old Akau the  chief,"
235,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Knowing Uhila's prowess and the blood
236,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Left by an English forbear in his veins,"
237,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Knowing that Taka too could boast, or  mourn,"
238,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"A foreign ancestry, had lately pledged"
239,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"His daughter to this brave, and now the  village"
240,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Made preparations for the marriage. There
241,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,By the warm sea the maidens paid their  court
242,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"To Taka, who so soon would leave their  gay"
243,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Indifferent frolic lives to wed the grave
244,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Stern chief. She did not falter at the  choice.
245,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Love which the maidens sang was but a  word;
246,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,She wished no better fate than to be  mated
247,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,To a strong warrior whom her heart held  dear
248,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,As friend to kind Akau. So she waited.
249,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"In her slim hands she held a polished cup,"
250,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The shell of cocoanut, which caught the  light"
251,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Like a brown pool. The toil of many days
252,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Had turned the tawny shade to warmest black
253,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,In gradual depths as shaded Taka's cheek;
254,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,With perfumed oil her fingers gave caress
255,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"And waked the hidden pictures in the grain,"
256,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The yellow sand, the dusky amber girl,"
257,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The brown perfected in the shining globe.
258,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Earth's monotones are justified in this.
259,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Close to her lolled small Hopa, blithe and gay"
260,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"As a young cricket, teasing all the rest"
261,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,With her sharp wit; often she dropped her work--
262,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The threading of bright flowers into wreaths--
263,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"To look across the waves, and suddenly"
264,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"She called, ""A sail, a little sail,"" and all"
265,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Followed her pointing fingers. Far away,"
266,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Tossed like a feather, black against the sky,"
267,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Hovered a tiny craft, its unknown lines"
268,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Marked it as stranger, and the maidens all"
269,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Curiously watched its coming to the shore.
270,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
271,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,All night the little shell with ceaseless dip
272,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"And pause, and rise and dip again, had borne"
273,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The trackless trade winds. Tui Tua Kau,"
274,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""King of the Reefs,"" had ventured over far"
275,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"From Tonga's shore. Caught by a wanton gale,"
276,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"His idle racing, lengthened in a whim"
277,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"To cheat his laughing mates, grew a wild flight."
278,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The frail canoe seemed, on the angry sea,"
279,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,A sweet rose petal blown across the night.
280,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Yet wisely now the winds had mind to crown
281,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Their joyous undertaking, and upon"
282,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The shores of Fiji's isles they drew their prize.
283,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The maidens on the shore had seen afar
284,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The stranger's coming, and the songs were stilled"
285,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,To hush of expectation. Even so
286,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"A prince might come to claim his kingdom, lone,"
287,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"In a frail craft, with weary eyes, and hair"
288,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Crowned with a fading wreath, more beautiful"
289,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Than all their lovers, slender, strong and young."
290,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,With one lithe spring he gained the yellow sand
291,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And caught the boat and drew it with a swing
292,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"High on the beach,--its movement seemed alive."
293,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"His sinewy fingers loosed the flapping sail,"
294,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Gay shells clinked musical against the mast,"
295,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"And all the maidens, timorous as birds,"
296,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Laughed at the sound with shy averted face.
297,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Then straight and slender as the cocoa palm,"
298,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Straight as its shaft and crowned with shining hair,"
299,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The stranger lifted up his head. The wreath,"
300,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Faded yet still alive thro' ocean's breath,"
301,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Drooped o'er his brows. His flashing sun-bright eyes
302,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Struck thro' the group of girls as shoots a dart,"
303,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And caught and quivered in sweet Taka's breast.
304,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"More noble than the rest, she scorned to fear,"
305,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"And graceful in her modesty she faltered,"
306,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Then came to meet and greet the stranger  guest.
307,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Erect she faced him, o'er her brow the frail"
308,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Curves of the crest she wore, antennæ-wise,"
309,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Trembled a little. As a maid beseems,"
310,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Her eyes drooped from his gaze, yet not too soon"
311,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,To miss the gleam with which he caught the first
312,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Flash of her beauty. With that glance he gained--
313,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Half conscious of a gladness--that this maid
314,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Was still for winning. As the custom is
315,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Her hair fell in twin braids, and were she wed"
316,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,They had been sacrificed to that estate.
317,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Maiden she was, his eyes caressed the sign"
318,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Black o'er the topaz beauty of her breast.
319,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The stranger spoke. ""Malua am I called;"
320,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,I hold for title Tui Tua Kau.
321,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Over the violent seas, beneath the frown,"
322,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Cold and untoward, of a starless sky,"
323,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The waves of chance have borne me; thro' the night
324,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Around me and above the pitiless trades
325,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Were blind with darkness, blown like maiden's hair"
326,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Across my face. As palm trees beaten by wind,"
327,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The tortured breakers tossed their streaming crests,"
328,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And all the light of all my life seemed dead--
329,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Then--morning broke, and I behold the sun!""--"
330,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,He held her with his gaze and found her eyes--
331,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""On Tonga's shore I reigned a chief, and now"
332,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"I am a beggar at your mercy."" Then"
333,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The young pride mounting to his cheek, he cried,"
334,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""Nay, but I jested, for I come so far"
335,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,To green Kambara for a lordly bowl
336,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Fit for the kava of a chief."""
337,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
338,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"She smiled,"
339,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And with the smile Malua felt the blood
340,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Leap in his heart, his heart inviolate"
341,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Never before so stirred 'neath woman's eyes.
342,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""Come, then, with me,"" said Taka, and the beach"
343,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Stretched from their feet, a ribbon that should bind"
344,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,In its white length the heaven to the earth.
345,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,With delicate step she led him to the hut
346,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Where old Akau gave him kindly greeting.
347,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"A little in the shadow, where the gourds"
348,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And strange sweet herbs--soft musty fragrances--
349,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Hung swinging from the beams about her head,"
350,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Taka withdrew. Her wide eyes opened wide,"
351,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"And, lightly folded on her golden breast,"
352,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Her two hands lay like flowers.
353,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
354,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,In the light
355,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Bright as a sun god sat Malua listening
356,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"With greatest reverence to the aged man,"
357,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Who spoke to him of ancient, long dead things"
358,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,While he displayed his wealth of burnished cups
359,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Out of the splendid eld. ""My son,"" he said,"
360,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""Yours is dim future, mine the deathless past;"
361,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Heroes have died for me and yet shall die,"
362,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And all the glory of the virgin earth
363,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Yields up its sweets to me, for now I rest"
364,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And stretch my withered sinews in the sun
365,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And wait for peaceful death; because your lips
366,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Are innocent, and dawn is in your eyes,"
367,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,I give you of my store the fairest treasure.
368,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"After my Taka, you have won my heart."""
369,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,In his strong hand he laid a bowl; for this
370,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The ages had paid toll, soft lightnings shone"
371,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"From its brown glory, carved most royally."
372,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"He raised the kava bowl aloft, the sun"
373,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Struck on its shining rim, and straight as a spear"
374,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Shivered the dusk where Taka stood. The light
375,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Lay on her swelling throat, and showed her eyes"
376,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Starred like a tropic night. The stranger's hand
377,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Trembled a little, and his quick-drawn breath"
378,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Carried a message from his breast to hers.
379,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,They left the hut together. From the clear
380,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Bright heat of noon they turned, and took their way"
381,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Into the greenly silent forest. Leaves
382,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Flickered above wet blossoms, simple sounds"
383,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Of homely labor borne upon the breeze
384,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Made them the more alone. They spoke of Love,"
385,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,A mighty word to ease the strange new pain
386,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Born in their hearts.
387,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
388,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Sudden the path grew wide--
389,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,A little space deprived of flowers and life--
390,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""The house of sandal wood,"" said Taka, pointing,"
391,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"And there, the last home of a chief, it lay."
392,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,White shells and snowy pebbles girt him round
393,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"In his great mould of clay, and all his spears"
394,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"And clubs of war kept vigil, showing still"
395,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,His might in battle. Shrill the parrot's scream
396,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Rang on the desolation, and the trees"
397,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Seemed to withdraw their shadows from the place
398,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Sacred to death, the violent crime of war."
399,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"A little shadow darkened Taka's heart,"
400,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Could this sweet world contain both death and love?
401,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,She sought Malua's eyes to be assured
402,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,That love lives always.
403,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
404,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,He had gone before
405,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"To hold the leaves for her to pass, and softly"
406,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"She came, and like a golden butterfly"
407,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Her small hand fluttered down upon his arm.
408,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,He caught his breath as tho' the leaping blood
409,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"That fled before this touch were very flame,"
410,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Then slowly, slowly turned, and in her eyes"
411,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Gave up his heart's desire. No word was said.
412,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"She knew not that she loved, he only  knew"
413,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"She was the moon of women; but their hearts,"
414,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Wiser than they, had flowered into one."
415,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Then as she passed beneath the swinging leaves,"
416,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,He caught the wreath wherewith on Tonga's shore
417,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The maids had crowned him ""King of Love and Beauty,"""
418,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And cast it from him with a high disdain
419,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Of token other than from Taka's hand.
420,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"She laughed to see it, and her step was light"
421,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Along the flowery way.
422,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
423,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Love in this land
424,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Grows into perfect stature as the swift
425,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Sweet growth of nature. In these gracious souls
426,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Love stood full-armed, godlike, from birth. Their lips"
427,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Whispered of life and laughter, but their hearts,"
428,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Singing together, told each other clear:"
429,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
430,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""Ah, Love, dear Love, there is no need to say,"
431,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Catch up life's song, its lightest, merriest word,"
432,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Pledge deep the golden sun, the breeze and bird,"
433,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Draw down long lashes over happy eyes,"
434,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"That none may guess the light that in them lies,"
435,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Nor with what secret smile your lips are stirred.
436,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The moonlight is so short, so long the day,"
437,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Nay, Love, dear Love, there is no need to say."""
438,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
439,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The whole world laughed with flowers overhead,"
440,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The sky a hollow sapphire ached with blue,"
441,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The green bright sea gave jewels to the sun,"
442,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And all the air was love that doting earth
443,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Breathed to the sun, her lover."
444,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
445,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,In the midst
446,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Two radiant gods with brave, wide eyes, and hair"
447,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Crowned with the beatific spring, they stood,--"
448,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Taka, the fair, and young Malua, fierce,"
449,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Passionate-hearted youth, and passionate youth;"
450,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Faltering before her innocent gaze, he cried,"
451,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""Dare I adore?"" so crystal clear she seemed"
452,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,A silver dewdrop in the rose of dawn.
453,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"And Taka, trembling: ""How can he be mine,"
454,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"So strong, so fair, a god with heart of flame!"""
455,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And so they strove against their hearts and lived
456,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Long lives of hope and fear and love's sweet pain
457,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Within a heart-beat. But the time was near!
458,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
459,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"There in mid-forest, rimmed with leaves jade green,"
460,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"All singing in the sun,--as deep and brown"
461,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"As Taka's eyes,--the pool disclosed itself."
462,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Across the clear light of the morning, showers"
463,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Of fiery jewels shone against the trees,--"
464,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Rubies, bright sapphires, purple amethyst,"
465,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Topaz, fierce opal, grass-green emeralds"
466,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Flitting and darting;--were they only birds!
467,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Flower made bird or bird made flower, they seemed"
468,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,To eyes newborn upon a world of love.
469,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The air was heavy with strange scents, the old"
470,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Familiar perfumes seemed so rarely sweet,"
471,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The jasmine was the very breath of love.
472,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"And when they rested on a flowery bank,"
473,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And Taka wove the red hibiscus wreath
474,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"To crown Malua, as he gazed at her,"
475,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Stretched at her feet, his chin upon his hand,"
476,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The whole long world had waited but for this.
477,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
478,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,(_Weaving the rosy wreath._)
479,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""My dream was of thee at sunrise"
480,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,With light steps over the sea.
481,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Lonely upon the mountain,"
482,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"I woke from my sleep for thee."""
483,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
484,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,(_Weaving the rosy wreath._)
485,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""The wild dark rocks were round me,"
486,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The flowery maids were gone;
487,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"I woke, thou--bright as lightning"
488,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Beside me--waited the dawn.
489,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
490,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""Weaving the rosy wreath,"
491,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,I weave my life in a dream.
492,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Thou camest through dawn on the sea,"
493,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Red flower on a sunlit stream."""
494,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,(_Weaving the rosy wreath._)
495,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
496,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,She laid the scarlet wreath upon his hair.
497,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""My King,"" she whispered, and Malua's eyes--"
498,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Boy, spite of all his battles--filled with tears"
499,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Wrung from his burdened heart. He caught her hand;
500,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The lake was hushed with noon-tide, far away"
501,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,A fond bird starred the forest with a cry.
502,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Then Taka turned, and in her eyes a light--"
503,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The light of summer moon in water still--
504,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"And in her face the glamour of moon and star,"
505,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,On which the crimson petals of her lips
506,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Lay trembling, eager wings to her new soul,"
507,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Love was confessed.
508,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
509,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The day went swiftly on.
510,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Malua left her side to gather fruits
511,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,For a love feast together. In a dream
512,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"His heart had moved, and like a child he longed"
513,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"To prove it real by sweet familiar ways,"
514,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Serving his fairest lady while their laughter
515,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Fell on the air like music. Taka, waiting"
516,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"On the green bank his coming, told her heart:"
517,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""Not for his beauty only, tho' his eyes"
518,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Burn into mine more beautiful than the night,"
519,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Not for the corded muscle in his arm
520,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Which broke a great branch that would stay my path,"
521,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Not for his voice, a murmur of soft seas,"
522,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Nor all the gracious ways he knows so well,"
523,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Not for his love that breaks within his eyes,--"
524,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"All these are dear, are dearer than my life,"
525,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"But for himself I love him,"" Taka dreamed."
526,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""To be his sister, nay, his mother then,"
527,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"To welcome him from hunting with my eyes,"
528,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"To fight his battles with the other women,"
529,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"To triumph in his triumphs, yet perchance"
530,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Be happier if when vanquished he would come
531,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Safe in my arms for shelter. If I might
532,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,But suffer for his sake and see him stand
533,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Stronger and happier--he should never guess--
534,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,But I might sometimes touch his hair and know
535,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The curls that clung around my fingers mine,"
536,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Bought by my pain as he, Malua, mine."
537,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Just so the heaven belongs to each small star
538,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Fixed by its gracious power eternally."""
539,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
540,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Thro' the late afternoon Uhila came.
541,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The Earth was idle, on her knees her hand"
542,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Opened, relaxed and empty, and her eyes"
543,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Closed to the ardent sun. The village slept,"
544,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Waiting for evening's cool. Uhila came;
545,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Over his shoulder like a silver shroud
546,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,He brought the gleaming fish. The purple shadows
547,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Lay in soft pools about the palms; the leaves,"
548,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Listless as weary love, hung motionless,"
549,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"And the hot green gave color to the air,"
550,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The world viewed through an emerald.
551,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"He came,"
552,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"And to Akau's hut he brought his gift,"
553,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,A mighty fish to grace the wedding feast.
554,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And where was Taka? All the gorgeous day
555,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"She had been absent, old Akau told;"
556,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"And of the stranger, wanderer, with eyes"
557,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Lit by the fires of youth, Akau told,"
558,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Like a glad wind of morning bearing spring,"
559,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Spring with the heart of summer, and his brow"
560,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Crowned with the calm white flowers of innocence.
561,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Uhila knew, in days long past he too"
562,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Had wandered thro' the forest in the glory
563,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And glow of youth.
564,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
565,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,With mouth set stern and grim
566,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,He followed to the pool. His heart was stirred
567,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"With turbulent emotions. She was his,--"
568,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Taka was his, the blossom that should cheer"
569,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The winter of his age. His springing step
570,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Was stealthy as a tiger's, and the way"
571,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Was clear before him. Rightly was he named
572,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The lightning; keen and cruel he would flash
573,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Into this sky of love, death in his hand."
574,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The path was strewn with little crimson flowers
575,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Scarlet festooned the trees, or was it blood"
576,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,That danced within his eyes? His thoughts were vague:
577,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Death, mercy, love, but strongest was desire"
578,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Merely to see and satisfy his fear.
579,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Sudden he saw them, and he hid his eyes"
580,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Before the sight, then strained to see again"
581,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Taka, her arms piled high with blossoms, stood,"
582,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,An amber goddess of spring with flying hair
583,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Beneath a flower-bent branch, whose leaves had caught"
584,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,One of her sun-kissed curls. Malua watched her.
585,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Laughing, she would have torn away the tress"
586,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And with the effort all the starry flowers
587,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Drifted like snow across their bended heads,"
588,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"But with a low cry he withheld her hand,"
589,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And standing where she needs must turn to see
590,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"His two arms o'er her slender shoulder laid,"
591,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,With fingers little used to gentler arts
592,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"His timid touch unloosed her perfumed hair,"
593,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Too near--for aught but that her curving throat
594,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Should be upturned to meet his sure caress,"
595,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And all the blossoms drifted thro' the air
596,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And fell like blessings on their bended heads.
597,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
598,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Uhila bore no more; his heart was great
599,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,With unshed tears; their beauty and their love
600,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Touched like soft music on his injured soul
601,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,With infinite sadness and a hopeless calm.
602,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,He left them there and sought the forest shades
603,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,To search his heart. A great nobility
604,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Slept in his native breast, and those pale drops"
605,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Of northern blood had taught him self-control
606,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"And might of mercy. To and fro he paced,"
607,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Learning his lesson. Taka, little moon"
608,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Sent by the gods to light his loneliness,"
609,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Was his no longer. He must twist his heart,"
610,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Wried with grim pain, to smiles of pleasantness."
611,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Ah, it was great. Uhila should be great,"
612,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Giving her to Malua as a gift,"
613,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Showing Akau how he wished no more
614,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"To wed so young a maid, and then the tears"
615,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Broke from his eyes and burned his throbbing breast.
616,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Homeward he turned, and all the sleepy birds"
617,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Twittered good-night--and almost was he glad.
618,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"In the cool green of evening, silent now"
619,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Save for their beating hearts, the lovers came"
620,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Back to the village. In the stranger's honor
621,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The people made a feast. The air was filled
622,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,With busy sounds of preparation. Some
623,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Brought driftwood for the fires, some gathered flowers"
624,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"To deck themselves, and all the fruitful earth"
625,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Was robbed of its delights for beauty's sake.
626,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Before the feasting Chief Akau rose,"
627,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Grave and majestic, for the evening prayer;"
628,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Pouring libation from the kava bowl
629,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"In a deep silence, to the gods he cried,"
630,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
631,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""Take of our offering, O you mighty gods,"
632,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Look on this people kindly, let them prosper"
633,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,In health and increase. Let the fecund ground
634,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Grant us, your creatures, life to serve you well."
635,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Take of our offering, O you gods of war,"
636,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Let men be brave and triumph in your name.
637,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Take of our offering, O you gods of sea,"
638,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Spare us your wrath, and in your might depart"
639,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Along the ocean to some far off shore.
640,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Take of our offering, all you mighty gods."""
641,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
642,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The feasting ended, round the fires they gathered,"
643,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Wise aged men telling anew their tales
644,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Of youth, sweet purposeless youth which dreams of stars"
645,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The while it gathers weeds--of battles dire.
646,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Their thin cold blood warmed with grim memories
647,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Of gods they told, of goddesses with hair"
648,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Streaming across the sunset, and of dear"
649,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Women long dead, and then the maidens came,"
650,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Singing their little songs. One sang of love:
651,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
652,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""The breath of spring is in his hair,"
653,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,He needs no crimson necklaces
654,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,To win the favor of the fair.
655,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
656,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""The full moon leaned to kiss his eyes,"
657,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The fairies brought him purple flowers,"
658,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The flowers of love, and made him wise."
659,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
660,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""The maidens die for his disdain,"
661,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"His heart strikes silver lightning,"
662,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Their warm tears stir the flowers like rain.
663,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
664,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""The breath of love is in his hair,"
665,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,He needs no crimson necklaces
666,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"To win the fairest of the fair."""
667,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
668,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Another sang of the sad mothers, lone"
669,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"In their dark homes at evening, while beyond"
670,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The limitless twilight on some field of war
671,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Their hearts lie dead.
672,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
673,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""O my men, my men!"
674,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Keen in the rain and sunshine
675,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"For glorious splendid deeds,"
676,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,You are gathered as idle weeds.
677,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
678,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""O my men, my men!"
679,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The mighty gods were jealous,"
680,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Your virtues shone like a star;
681,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The enemy came from afar!
682,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
683,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""O my men, my men!"
684,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Vengeance shall follow soon,"
685,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Your people shall blast the foe
686,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Or ever the cold winds blow.
687,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
688,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""O my men, my men!"
689,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"My life is an empty shell,"
690,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"No one has heard my moan,"
691,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"I sit in the dark alone."""
692,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
693,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Then of the gods they sang,--a moonlight song:"
694,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
695,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""Sleep, O soft little winds,"
696,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Restless whispering grass,"
697,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Reeds of the water-ways sway not,"
698,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Sleep, that the gods may pass."
699,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
700,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""Deepen, you dreams of the sleepers,"
701,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Veil you, O fire of the moon."
702,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Darken, you silver of stars,"
703,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Sleep, for the gods come soon."
704,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
705,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""Sleep, for the gods who sleep not"
706,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Pass on the midnight's breath;
707,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Mystical, magical, secret,"
708,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Sleep, for to wake is death."""
709,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
710,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And after singing came the dance; the brown
711,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Lithe women decked with bright fantastic hues
712,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Wavered into the circle of the light.
713,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Kneeling, they wove their spells. As gracious flowers"
714,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Swayed by the winds of evening, they were blown"
715,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,By breezes of desire. The eye was filled
716,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,With luxury of soft motion and the sound
717,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Of soft monotonous chanting charmed the ear.
718,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Then in their midst came Taka, and she stood,"
719,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Waiting the signal. Slow she raised her arms,"
720,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Slow as tho' ages hung upon her hands
721,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Heavy with burdened love. The music hushed.
722,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Deep in the mystery of her steady eyes
723,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Lingered the secret of the world, and then"
724,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Laughter and light came dancing from her smile.
725,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Her fingers fluttered on the harp of love,"
726,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And every chord uttered itself again
727,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Within some dusky heart. The earth was still.
728,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The warm night air was strong with heavy scent
729,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Of oil upon the dancers and the flowers
730,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,That decked their breasts and hair. Malua's soul
731,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Fainted beneath the load of so much love,"
732,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"And when the dance was finished, and her eyes"
733,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Held him for one long second ere she smiled
734,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"And stole away, he knew for death or life"
735,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,His spirit lay within her golden hands.
736,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
737,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Woe for Uhila! As the twilight glow
738,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Faded in soft immeasurable plains
739,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Of darkness, so the beauty in his heart"
740,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Faded in clouds of wrath. The great fire blazed--
741,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,A ruby in the raven hair of night--
742,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And clear across the flames Uhila saw
743,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"His rival, garlanded with blossoms, pale,"
744,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Calm as a happy lover. Could he smile
745,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Over his empty hands and meekly bow--
746,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Uhila bow!--to taste a stranger's whip!
747,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Death snapped the sparks, and Vengeance hurled the flames."
748,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Like blood the fire fell o'er the bare young heart,"
749,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And he who watched in one mad bound foresaw
750,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,How blood indeed might flash across that breast.
751,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The high resolve grew dim in that fierce light,"
752,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""'Tis noble, strong;"" then, in a stab of keen"
753,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Humor, he saw again a native brave"
754,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Decking his naked body with the coat
755,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Crowned with the hat of some sea-faring man,--"
756,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Aping the civilization of his stride
757,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Till his new prowess fell to comrade's jeers.
758,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,So with a tiger heart it were to wear
759,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,A grave forgiveness of this wanton wrong.
760,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The primal lust had burst the slender bar,"
761,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Weak white man's morals. Now to slay and slay.
762,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
763,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Darkling, he fixed Malua with his eyes,"
764,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Noting each shadow of his changing thoughts,"
765,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"When the dear dreams centred on Taka, dreams"
766,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Dimming his sight. Holding his lips apart,"
767,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"He slowly rose, Uhila following,"
768,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,For in the dark the music of her face
769,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Smote on the boy till he could bear no more
770,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The feasting and the firelight; silently
771,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"He rose and stole away. The night was still,"
772,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"And ""Taka, Taka, Taka,"" rang his soul"
773,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Against the stars. He felt infinity
774,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Above him brood, and knew the mighty gods,"
775,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Who once in every lifetime drop an hour
776,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Of their remembrance fraught with godlike bliss
777,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"To luckless man, had turned on him their eyes."
778,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Unconsciously his feet retraced the path
779,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,To the dark pool where joy had birth that day.
780,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The scents that wake when the cool dusk begins
781,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Lapped him luxuriously; the heavy sweet
782,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Of passionate gardenia,--kiss made flower,--"
783,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"White as his turbulent love, was as the crown"
784,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And climax of the jasmine stars that breathed
785,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"His love in placid day, and when he paused"
786,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Beside the pool, the forest held its breath."
787,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
788,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""O sweet, O beautiful!"" Malua cried,"
789,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,His young eyes blazing to the tropic night.
790,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""Never before, since all the gods were young,"
791,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Was woman loved as I love Taka."" Then,"
792,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Caught in a very ecstasy of love,"
793,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"He laid his arms about a slender tree,"
794,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"White in the moonlight, and his fevered cheek"
795,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Pressed on its cooling stem. With broken music
796,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Shaken from his breast, he cried on Taka,--"
797,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Little happy words that mothers whisper
798,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Above their sleeping babes. ""If love could find"
799,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"A way to utter love without her lips!"""
800,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Her lips, her eyes, the music of her voice--"
801,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Death would be easy on her golden heart.
802,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,He pictured her at twilight in the door
803,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Of their far home, with eager arms outstretched"
804,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,To welcome him from toil; how she would stand
805,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"A queen among the other women, crowned"
806,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"With crimson flowers. How had he won her, he"
807,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,A stranger to her people and her blood!
808,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"For in her veins the stream ran pale, but, ""Ah,"""
809,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"He cried, ""my kiss shall burn it red again."
810,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"White she may be, a queen, my queen, she is,"
811,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"And still my slave in fetters of my love."""
812,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
813,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Uhila watched him from the shadow.
814,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Gods!
815,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"How young he was! as Vave, the swift-footed"
816,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Splendidly strong, an innocent god of war."
817,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The morn with chilly lips laid myriad kisses
818,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"About his beauty, slipped thro' jealous leaves"
819,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Dripping with silver and fantastic fingers
820,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Reached to caress him from the amorous trees.
821,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Hither and forth he paced; Uhila's eyes
822,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Ached with his hatred of the sight; at length
823,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""Taka,"" Malua cried, and stretched his arms"
824,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Rigid in air, his face against the sky."
825,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The goad was in Uhila's soul, he leapt"
826,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Into the moonlight and upon his foe.
827,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Fixed to the ground, they strove as giant trees"
828,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Tossing fierce branches in a storm; their wrath
829,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Smote on them like a tempest, hot with hate."
830,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Malua knew a curse was in the hands
831,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"That sought his throat, and in the blazing eyes"
832,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Close to his own. Life would defend fair life
833,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,As chief and Taka's lover. Round the shoulders
834,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Dark and strong, straining to his heaving breast,"
835,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"He threw his arms, and locked in that embrace"
836,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"They stood a moment, breathing with the quick"
837,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Sharp catch of weary runners. Then a turn--
838,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Raising his knee, Uhila strove in vain"
839,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,To throw his enemy. Upon their heads
840,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And swaying bodies lay the silver light
841,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Of the bright moon. The great night seemed to pause
842,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Chin upon hand to watch the struggle, air"
843,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Hushed to retain the hoarse and laboring sobs
844,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Such strain brought forth. Their shining bodies, oiled"
845,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"In honor of the feast, granted no hold"
846,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,To the fierce gripping arms.
847,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
848,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Then suddenly
849,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Uhila sprang aside and grasped a branch,"
850,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"A rough, harsh weapon--for they were unarmed."
851,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Wary they watched each other's eyes, like beasts"
852,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Stealthy, retreating, circling with heads low,"
853,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Bodies bent for the catch. Malua sprang
854,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Close to Uhila, caught his murderous hand,"
855,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"And with the branch between them, all its thorns"
856,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Tearing their breasts, they strove once more. The moon"
857,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Glittered in troubled ripples, they had come"
858,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Under the shadow of the trees, the dark"
859,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Goaded Uhila's soul anew, his blood,"
860,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Blazing with conflict, gave him mad-man's strength"
861,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"And devil's skill. His straining form relaxed,"
862,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Heavily slipping earthward; ere Malua
863,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Could gain fresh hold upon his fainting foe,"
864,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Uhila with a twist had laid him low,"
865,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Knee on his breast, lean fingers at his throat"
866,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Seizing his life.
867,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
868,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Malua's eyes grew dim,"
869,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The gentle stars seen faint thro' hanging leaves
870,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Wavered uncertainly; his brain seemed black,"
871,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Confused with horrid death, the dewy moss"
872,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,He lay on failed beneath him. Suddenly
873,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Hanging upon the brittle rim of death,"
874,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"His outstretched hand, gripping the scattered leaves,"
875,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Closed on a sharp stone, instinct more than brain"
876,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Showed him the way; he raised his weapon, struck"
877,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And struck and struck again.
878,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The night looked down
879,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Waning, and saw thro' tangled boughs a still,"
880,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Dead figure on the troubled earth. All stained
881,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"With crimson blood, there lay a crimson wreath,"
882,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And thro' the forest stole a dusky shade
883,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Fleeing he knew not where save that he 'scaped
884,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Death, that was lying by the forest pool."
885,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
886,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"At dawn the weary boy, who thro' the night"
887,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Had cried his love and anguish to the dark,"
888,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Wandering half crazed thro' forest deeps unknown,"
889,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Feeling upon his throat the hand of hate,"
890,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Feeling upon his heart the still more potent
891,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Fingers of love, came to the open shore"
892,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Waiting for day. The restless, eager foam,"
893,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Stretching white arms around the sleeping earth,"
894,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Woke his great love anew. The loneliness
895,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Of open spaces set his hungry soul
896,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Dreaming of Taka, Taka who should come"
897,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And fill the empty world for him. The sky
898,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Paled at the thought. The dawn was stealing near,"
899,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Glimmering faintly on the edge of night.
900,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,He could delay no longer; like a thief
901,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,He must secure his jewel in the dark.
902,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,In the vast pause that presages the morn
903,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"He came to Taka's door. Ajar it stood,"
904,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And on the mats within he saw revealed
905,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,The pure young oval of her perfect face.
906,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""Taka, my little one,"" Malua whispered,"
907,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"And thro' her dreams ""Malua"" passed her lips,"
908,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Slipping insensibly to waking. So
909,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"She saw him at the door and came to him,"
910,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Her dewy dreams still warm within her eyes,"
911,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And gave her face to passionate caress.
912,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Then with soft, broken words he told again"
913,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"His love, and after when her heart was full"
914,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Of glad acceptance, as a flash of fire"
915,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Searing his image on her soul, he told"
916,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,How blood had paid the price of love.
917,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
918,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"She heard,"
919,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And daylight ebbed before her eyes to faint
920,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"White mist, then refluent turned and smote"
921,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Her heart's eyes with the horror of the truth.
922,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Uhila dead. Uhila with the smile
923,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"That woke for her alone. Her thoughts, like leaves"
924,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Blown by cold winds, were scattered, and the words"
925,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"""Uhila dead"" was but a symbol grim"
926,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Of darkness. All the past, her happy life"
927,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Flower in the sun, her home, and all the dear"
928,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Familiar duties, all her life to come"
929,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Woven with thoughts of kind Uhila, all"
930,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Struck to the ground by murder. In her blood
931,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The pale drops cried to heaven against the wrong,"
932,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Wrong to her people and her love, till now"
933,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,So beautiful.
934,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
935,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Malua knew her pain,"
936,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,And how upon its verdict hung his life.
937,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Death's flame had touched the golden rose of love.
938,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"If it be dross or gold, the test should tell."
939,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The black gulf night that lies 'twixt dawn and dawn,"
940,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Deepened by darker sin,--could frail love, tired"
941,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"With passion, hope to bridge the perilous way?"
942,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"His brain cried, ""No,"" his heart, ""Ah, Gods, but yes"
943,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Or I shall die."""
944,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
945,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,He laid a tender arm
946,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,About the shrinking child and drew her forth
947,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Along the forest path. She did not hear
948,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"The morning birds who blithely welcomed  day,"
949,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"She did not see the dew upon the leaves,"
950,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Glamour of dawn, but dazed with love and pain,"
951,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Yielding to that she knew not, kept the way"
952,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Towards the forest pool.
953,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
954,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"It seemed to them,"
955,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Waiting the unutterable moment of their loss
956,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Or utmost gain, as tho' the swinging earth"
957,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Was emptied of all life, the very air"
958,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Seemed hollow and unearthly, breathless pause"
959,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"On a great brink. They reached the pool, and Taka"
960,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Gathered her senses till her eyes were clear
961,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,As shining wells of truth. She leaned no more
962,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Helpless upon Malua, tho' his arm"
963,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Circled her still. Before them on the path,"
964,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Noble and dead, with mute hands pleading, eyes"
965,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Subtle with secrets of eternity,"
966,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Waited Uhila.
967,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
968,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,In a moment's space
969,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Malua knew the utter pangs of death
970,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Strong as his soul. And Taka must be free,"
971,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Free to decide between the mighty dead
972,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"And him, the weakest of all living men."
973,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"He spoke no word, the blood of youth once more"
974,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Fought with the skill, the power, the eloquence"
975,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Of great familiar age. If Taka drew
976,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"From out his arms and love a heart-beat's time,"
977,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"She had decided, and Uhila won."
978,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"This the boy knew. Taka had seen him, Ah!"
979,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Her woman's heart in pity and distress
980,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Shivered as tho' cold death had laid a hand
981,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Upon her brow. Malua felt a hell
982,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Deep as the world, and then--the sky, pale stars,"
983,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Rose dawn, unfathomed heaven rocked in his heart"
984,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"With tumult of his glory. Taka turned,"
985,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Drew closer in his arm, and raising up"
986,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Her flowery face smiled in his eyes.
987,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,'Twas done--
988,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Death, life and passionate passion burned away"
989,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,In the white flame of love.
990,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Uhila lay
991,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Vanquished, forgotten. Turning to the sea,"
992,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,"Taka, Malua, children of the sun,"
993,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,Went forth to meet the sunrise and the day.
994,A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA,
