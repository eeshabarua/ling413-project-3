62,MYSELF AND YOU,MYSELF AND YOU 
63,MYSELF AND YOU,"There are only myself and you in the world, There are only myself and you; 'Tis clear, then, that I unto you should be kind, And that you unto me should be true. "
64,MYSELF AND YOU,"And if I unto you could be always kind, And you unto me could be true, Then the criminal courts might all be adjourned, And the sword would have nothing to do. "
65,MYSELF AND YOU,"A few fertile acres are all that I need,-- Not more than a hundred or two,-- And the great, wide earth holds enough, I am sure, Enough for myself and for you. "
66,MYSELF AND YOU,The sweet air of heaven is free to us all; Upon all fall the rain and the dew; And the glorious sun in his cycle of light Shines alike on myself and on you. 
67,MYSELF AND YOU,"The infinite love is as broad as the sky, And as deep as the ocean's blue, We may breathe it, bathe in it, live in it, aye, It is _life_ for myself and for you. "
68,MYSELF AND YOU,"And the Christ who came when the angels sang Will come, if the song we renew, And reign in his kingdom,--the Prince of Peace,-- Reigning over myself and you. "
69,MYSELF AND YOU,"O, then, may I be unto you always kind, And be you unto me always true; So the land may rest from its turmoil and strife, And the sword may have nothing to do. "

71,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE 
72,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""You do but dream; the world will never see Such time as this you picture, when the sword Shall lie inglorious in its sheath, and be No more of valorous deeds incentive or reward."" "
73,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"The ocean breezes fanned them where they sat, At leisure from life's conflict, toil and care, Yet not unthoughtful, nor unmindful that In all its weal and woe they held their share. "
74,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"The rose-light charm and pride of earliest youth A chastening touch had toned to lovelier hue, And the white soul of purity and truth Looked out alike from eyes of brown and blue. "
75,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""I covet your fair hope,"" he spake again, ""I cannot share it; all the hoary past Denies that mightier prowess of the pen The poet claims, and proves it still surpassed "
76,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""By sword and musket and the arts of war. And 'twere not so,--the query will return, Albeit such conflict we must all abhor-- How should the fires of patriotism burn? "
77,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""Their flames are kindled by the flash of arms, And fed by recount of heroic deed; The sanguinary story has its charms Tho the heart sicken o'er it as we read. "
78,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""And what were Greece without her Marathon? Or Rome, had not her Caesars fought and won? How reigns Britannia, Empress near and far, But for her Waterloo and Trafalgar? "
79,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""And we, know not our souls a quickening thrill At thought of Lexington and Bunker Hill? And with a pride no rival passion mars Greet we not now our glorious Stripes and Stars? "
80,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""Yes, friend, I own your theory is fine; I grant your outlook far exceedeth mine In excellence and beauty, in its scope Embracing that millennial age of bliss The spirit pants for while it chafes in this; I covet, tho I cannot share, your hope."" "
81,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""My hope,"" she answered, smiling, ""is a faith; The kingdoms of this world are yet to be The kingdoms of our blessed Lord, the Christ;-- Lord of all life thro' dire and vengeful death-- Wrought thro' such sacrifice, unspared, unpriced, His word and purpose must fulfilment see, And realms by mountains bounded or by seas Must own allegiance to the Prince of Peace. "
82,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""I yield to none""--and as she spoke there sped Across the opal beauty of the sea A light-winged vessel, bearing at its head The starry emblem of the brave and free-- "
83,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""I yield to none in loyalty and love For yon bright banner, but I hold it still As token to the world, all else above, Of peace on earth and unto man good will. "
84,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""God gave His land to be the home of man; And all that brightens and upbuilds the home Uplifts humanity; tramp, tribe and clan, Knowing no hearthstone, are content to roam, "
85,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""But drawing nearer God the man returns And rears his household altar. In some quest The feet may wander, but the heart still yearns For the soft home-light and the quiet rest. "
86,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""Think yet again, good brother, is it not From off such altar, whether it may glow In princely palace or in lowliest cot, That the true flame of country-love must flow? While that enkindled by the flash of arms Is a 'strange fire,' consuming while it charms. "
87,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""Lives Greece less nobly in her Parthenon, In what her Solons wrote, her poets sang, Than in the gastly pride of Marathon, And kindred fields where victors' praises rang? "
88,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""And we, enriched thro' Commerce, Letters, Art, Forgot our earlier grievances and scars, Are we not ready for a better part? Have we not now outgrown our need of wars? "
89,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""Surely it should be so,"" he made reply; ""The sated earth cries out against the flow Of human blood: 'How long? how long?' The cry Must pierce the heavens from writhing hearts below. "
90,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""But men heed not; the glamor and the gain Of warfare blind them to its sin and pain; They know not pity and they count not cost Till armies meet and life and cause are lost. "
91,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""Would they but listen 'twere an errand blest To plead against oppressor for oppressed; Would they but follow it were joy indeed Up the white hills of truth and peace to lead. "
92,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""But, ah! the multitudes are gone astray, The powerful of the earth will have their way; What profit, sister, in our prayers and tears? Why mar the spring-time gladness of our years "
93,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""In vain pursuit of universal good? In fruitless care for earth's vast brotherhood? Glad would I grasp such work could I but see. Or near, or far, your hoped-for victory."" "
94,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""Whether they hear,"" she answered, ""or forbear, 'Tis ours with signal truths to light the skies; God's promises and warnings to declare;-- How can men follow if no leader rise? "
95,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""The Christ shall be the victor; O my friend, Why do we limit His almighty power Who sees from far beginning to the end? Whose day may be an æon or an hour? "
96,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""The sea is His; He made it; and His word Can speak its wildest tumult into calm; As He may will its deepest founts are stirred, Or surface-ripples breathe a praiseful psalm. "
97,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""As well His power the rise and fall doth sway Of human passion, tho He suffer long; The puny pride of man shall yet obey The mandate of the Only Wise and Strong. "
98,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""But God would have the children of His grace In this great reclamation have a share; And each in his appointed hour and place Must stand, or other brow his crown will wear."" "
99,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"She paused, and o'er them, as with magic spell, For a brief space a holy silence fell; Then while the sunset crimson of the sky Set ocean all a-blush, he made reply: "
100,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""Reason and candor justify your claim; The Infinite is infinite in all; The Power that touches into life that flame Holds earth and heaven subject to His call, And at His fiat peoples rise and fall. "
101,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""Your dauntless zeal doth shame my coward heart; Your word of faith my courage doth inspire; I see 'tis only noble to have part In moral contest; not to fan the fire Of a false glory, which must ever feed On souls that perish, and on hearts that bleed. "
102,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""And this I gather from your earnest plea;-- That souls which walk in light and see the way To heights of truth yet unattained, must be Fore-runners for their Lord, must work and pray For the incoming of the perfect day. "
103,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""Join we in this sweet service; cherish still The trust that gives you courage for the fight; Your 'peaceful war' on all that's base and ill, Your patient battle for the pure, the right. Let us press on and mount the hills of light."" "
104,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"The ocean murmur fell upon their ears Sweeter than bird-song or the voice of mirth, As beamed her answering smile, thro' grateful tears, While her lips whispered only ""Peace on earth."" "
105,AN ARGUMENT FOR PEACE,"""Peace! peace!""--the evening zephyrs caught the strain, The wavelets sent the word across the sea; Exultant Nature trilled the glad refrain;-- ""Peace! peace! The Christ is come, and peace shall be!"" "
106,AT THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR,AT THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR 
107,AT THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR,"Neighbor, neighbor, prithee stay; Wherefore hasten on thy way? Give a moment's heed to me, I would ask a thing of thee. "
108,AT THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR,"Neighbor, days and months have fled, Seasons one by one have sped, And to-night I greet thee here At the passing of the year. "
109,AT THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR,"'Tis the time of reckoning now, Of new resolves and annual vow; Time of straightening ugly crooks, And careful balancing of books. "
110,AT THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR,"Pardon if I now demand How accounts of thine may stand; Hast thou rendered, fair and true, Unto every man his due? "
111,AT THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR,Hast thou given timely heed To thy poorer brother's need? Hath thy strong arm been a stay To the weaker on the way? 
112,AT THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR,"When didst thou a joy impart To thy sister, sad at heart! When didst thou her grief beguile With the sunshine of thy smile? "
113,AT THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR,When the heavy-laden came Didst thou breathe a Saviour's name? When temptations fierce did prove Didst thou whisper of His love? 
114,AT THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR,"When hosts of evil have assailed, And against the right prevailed, Hast thou still undaunted stood Pleading for the pure and good? "
115,AT THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR,"When--but neighbor, this is strange! While I question comes a change: All that I have asked of thee Comes for answer back to me. "
116,AT THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR,"Comes, against my wish and will, Comes and sets my heart a-thrill; Comes with terrors of the law, Filling me with fear and awe. "
117,AT THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR,"Strange transition! Can it mean?-- The marvel of this shifting scene-- Yes, I read the mystery now. Neighbor, mine own soul art thou. "
118,AT THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR,"Now, my soul, 'tis thine to say How the record stands to-day Give account of loss or gain, Talent used or spent in vain. "
119,AT THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR,"All unwitting how they sped I my listed queries read; Raised the duty-standard high, Challenged measurement thereby. "
120,AT THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR,"While I queried came a change, Silent, solemn, passing strange;-- Neighbor glided into mist, Soul and self were keeping tryst. "
121,AT THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR,"And the queries come anew: Soul of mine, be brave and true; Lo! _our_ books we balance now; I have questioned; answer thou. "
122,RISEN,RISEN 
123,RISEN,"""He is risen; He is risen, Here His empty tomb you see; And He goeth as He told you To the hills of Galilee."" Thus to loving, loyal women, In the centuries agone, Angel voices told the story Of the resurrection morn. "
124,RISEN,"He is risen! He is risen! Years hand down the glad refrain; Let the ages on to ages Waft the tidings yet again. He who near the Bethlehem manger Lowly child of earth was born, King of kings reigns all triumphant Since the resurrection morn. "
125,RISEN,"Christ is risen! Calvary's anguish All a lost world's ransom paid; Then, with tears, ""the hope of Israel"" In the new-made tomb was laid. "
126,RISEN,Deep and dark the desolation Falling with that night forlorn; Radiant the dawn awakening With the resurrection morn. 
127,RISEN,"He has risen! By this token We with Him shall rise again; Faith shall vanquish doubt and terror, Joy shall banish grief and pain. No more fear of sin's temptation, No more dread of hatred's scorn, O the glory purchased for us On the resurrection morn! "
128,RISEN,"Christ is risen! Bow before Him, To His courts an offering bring; Suffering Lord and Lamb victorious, Crown Him Conquerer, Priest and King. Robe of light for robe of mocking, Diadem for crown of thorn, Wears He now, and in His likeness Rise we, satisfied, immortal, In the resurrection morn. "
129,ELIZABETH CROWNED,ELIZABETH CROWNED 
130,ELIZABETH CROWNED,"Elizabeth of Hungary, a widow at the age of twenty, was sought in marriage by Frederick II., Emperor of Germany. She, having taken a vow never to marry again, declined his offer, and devoted her life to deeds of kindness and charity. She died at the age of twenty-four, and was canonized as a saint by Gregory IX. At this ceremony Frederick placed upon her head a golden crown, saying, ""Since thou wouldst not be crowned as my Empress, I crown thee to-day as an immortal Queen in the kingdom of God."" "
131,ELIZABETH CROWNED,"When once I saw thee, fair, yet sad and lone,-- Tho wealth and beauty waited at thy hand-- I would have crowned thee, saintly one, mine own; Glad would have had thee share with me my throne, Bride of my heart, and Empress of my land! "
132,ELIZABETH CROWNED,"But thou wert wedded to thy valiant dead, And to the service of a Christ-like love; So by thy hand the suffering poor were led, And from thy bounty were the hungry fed, Till came thy summons to the Court Above. "
133,ELIZABETH CROWNED,"Now hast thou passed from tears and pain away, Thine ear hath caught the heavenly melodies;-- So be it mine, with reverent touch, to-day, On thy fair head this diadem to lay, And crown thee Queen immortal for the skies! "
134,WHO IS SUFFICIENT?,WHO IS SUFFICIENT? 
135,WHO IS SUFFICIENT?,"Six-and-thirty little mortals Coming to be taught; And mine that most ""delightful task To rear the tender thought."" Merry, mischief-loving children, Thoughtless, glad and gay, Loving lessons--""just a little,"" Dearly loving play. "
136,WHO IS SUFFICIENT?,"Six-and-thirty souls immortal, Coming to be fed; Needing ""food convenient for them,"" As their daily bread. Bright and happy little children, Innocent and free, Coming here their life-long lessons Now to learn of me. "
137,WHO IS SUFFICIENT?,"Listen to the toilsome routine, List, and answer them, For these things who is sufficient 'Mong the sons of men? Now they, at the well-known summons, Cease their busy hum; And, some with pleasure, some reluctant, To the school-room come. "
138,WHO IS SUFFICIENT?,"Comes a cunning little urchin With defiant eye, ""Making music"" with his marbles As he passes by. But, alas! the pretty toys are Taken from him soon, And the music-loving Willie Strikes another tune! "
139,WHO IS SUFFICIENT?,"Comes a lisping little beauty, Scarce five summers old; Baby voice and blue eyes pleading, ""Please, misth, I'm stho cold!"" Little one, the world is chilly, All too cold for thee; From its storms ""Our Father"" shield thee, And thy refuge be. "
140,WHO IS SUFFICIENT?,"While I turn to caution Johnny Not to make such noise; Mary parses: ""Earth's an adverb, In the passive voice."" Well, indeed, it must be passive, Else it is not clear How such open language-murder, Goes unpunished here. "
141,WHO IS SUFFICIENT?,"""Second Reader Class"" reciting-- ""Lesson verse or prose?"" None in all the class is certain; Each one thinks he knows. ""Well,"" is queried then, ""the difference Who can now define?"" Answers Rob: ""In verse they never Finish out the line!"" "
142,WHO IS SUFFICIENT?,"Boy, thy thought doth strangely thrill me, And as hours roll on, Hears my heart a solemn query: Is my day's work done? Do I make of this my life-task Prose or idle rhyme? Do I in the sight of Heaven Finish out the line? "
143,WHO IS SUFFICIENT?,"Oh, it is ""too fine a knowledge"" For our mortal sight, All these restless little creatures How to lead aright. He who prayeth while he worketh, Taking lessons still Of the Friend of little children, Learning all His will; "
144,WHO IS SUFFICIENT?,"He alone can walk before them Worthily and well; He alone of life's strange language Can the meaning tell. May I then with heart as tender As a little child Lead my flock; and Father, keep them Pure and undefiled. "
145,PEACE,PEACE 
146,PEACE,"O blessed peace, that floweth like a river, Unstayed, unwearied, ever on and on; That hath its fount and spring in Christ the giver, And finds its ocean round the great white Throne. "
147,PEACE,"O peace of God, that passeth understanding, Thou art the answer to my soul's long quest; Doubts, fears and sins, their serried hosts disbanding, I leave, launch on thy wave, and anchored, rest. "
148,BOYS AND GIRLS,BOYS AND GIRLS 
149,BOYS AND GIRLS,"We were ""seven in all,"" as the dear rustic maid To the poet so sweetly protested; And together we rambled and studied and played, Each imbibing a share of the sunshine and shade Wherewith our young life was invested. "
150,BOYS AND GIRLS,"And black eyes and blue eyes and brown eyes and gray Looked up to the face of our mother, As she led us in study in labor or play, Or told of ""Our Father,"" and taught us to pray, And to cherish and love one another. "
151,BOYS AND GIRLS,"O, the rapture of being when life is a-tune With the song-life and beauty of morning; When the roseate dawn brightens into the noon, And the year hastens on to the splendor of June, In her fragrance and matchless adorning. "
152,BOYS AND GIRLS,"So our years flitted by and the youngest of all-- Our dark-eyed and fun-loving brother-- Was grown to be manly and lithesome and tall, And to couteous titles we answered the call, But were still ""boys"" and ""girls"" to each other. "
153,BOYS AND GIRLS,"O, the joy of endeavor, endurance and toil On thro' summer-time vigor and sweetness, Of triumph o'er that which would hinder or foil, Of the patience of hope after tears and turmoil, In the glory of autumn's completeness. "
154,BOYS AND GIRLS,"And the toil and the turmoil and tears have been ours-- From our ranks we have missed a loved brother We've encountered the thorns, but we've cherished the flowers; We've passed under the clouds on to sunnier hours, And we're still ""boys"" and ""girls"" to each other. "
155,A SMILE,A SMILE 
156,A SMILE,"The gliding of a fairy form And rosy lips that knew no guile, With wonder parted, came to ask, ""Papa, what is a smile?"" "
157,A SMILE,"A smile, whate'er it is, then stole That gentle parent's features o'er; For ne'er to him had been proposed Query so strange before. "
158,A SMILE,"But while he pondered in his heart How he should to his child reply, A new, triumphant joy lit up Her loving, lustrous eye;-- "
159,A SMILE,"And with this gladsome, new-found thought, She answered in her own behalf: ""Oh, now, I know; a smile must be _The whisper to a laugh!_"" "
160,"""A SPARROW ALONE ON THE HOUSETOP""","""A SPARROW ALONE ON THE HOUSETOP"" "
161,"""A SPARROW ALONE ON THE HOUSETOP""","Sing, little sparrow, sing thy song. No peril neareth thee; Tho night be dark or day be long, Or clouds hang low, sing on, sing on, The dear God heareth thee. "
162,"""A SPARROW ALONE ON THE HOUSETOP""","Sing, little bird, whate'er befall-- Trill out thine utmost need; Thou canst not soar, thou canst not fall But He will note who knoweth all, And He thy plaint will heed. "
163,"""A SPARROW ALONE ON THE HOUSETOP""","O little sparrow, far and high Thy soft notes God-ward go, And I with thee send up my cry, And both shall somewhere find reply, _God careth for us so._ "
164,TO MOTHER,TO MOTHER 
165,TO MOTHER,"O mother, from thy home beyond the stars Hast thou not known the yearning of thy child For thy sweet love? Hast thou not heard her wild And piteous moaning for thy soft caress? Felt her heart's aching for the tenderness And the low patience of thy loving voice? Hast thou not seen her 'mid life's toils and jars, Pant as a bird behind its prison bars, For freedom to fly forth and be with thee? And canst thou not, sweet mother, send reply? Oh, thro' the depths of glory, thro' the sky, Look for one moment down and say to me That all of loss on earth thou findest to be Great gain in heaven; that thou dost rejoice In all that was, and is, and shall betide At last to all; and that, in Him who died, Yet liveth evermore, I, too, shall see All discord blended into harmony; And that I, too, shall be, as thou art, satisfied. "

174,ON HER MARRIAGE DAY,"Sister, we know That God is good, and He hath led us on By pleasant ways or painful to this day. Our lives went on together until now. In childhood and in youth the same fond home Hath been our earthly refuge; the same Rock Our shelter when earth had no rest or shade. At the same fancy we have often smiled, For the same sorrow wept; and oft our souls, In mingling aspirations, have sent up The same thanksgiving, the same burning prayer. Yes, we have lived _together_; we have known The visible blending of the outward life Made real by the holier unison Of loving spirit and aspiring mind. The spells of joy have bound us--and of hope, And tears--which are the diamond links of love-- Have made the chain of our affection strong. It may be thus no more; yet--God is good-- I hush the moaning of my riven heart, And smile that thou art happy; and give thanks That thy sweet life, rejoicing, hath put on Its richest diadem, its crown of love. May the kind Father grant that crown to be All worthy of the wearer; may His smile Lend brightness to it ever; and at last, When it is laid with earthly robes away, O may the infinite and eternal Love Rest like a glory on thy radiant brow.

"
183,ON HER SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY,"And life is such a volume, only thou, From garnered storage of the heart and mind, Must fill unwritten pages, and allow Fair pictures--of pure thought, of self resigned, Of kindly deeds--each new-made page to grace;-- How blest if none thou, later, woulds't efface! "
184,ON HER SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY,"Sixteen! A May-day in the path of life, A marvelous puzzle on the finger twirled; Sixteen again; a stir of earnest strife And toil and tumult in a restless world; Repeated still,--a patient, steadfast hold On good attained,--ripe fruit, and grain of gold. "

227,VISIONS,VISIONS 
228,VISIONS,"I saw when Israel toiled and groaned beneath the Pharoah's rod, And in his hopeless bondage moaned his helpless prayer to God. "
229,VISIONS,"I saw when from the river's brink the infant leader rose, Who, reared in Egypt's royal court, still felt his brothers' woes. "
230,VISIONS,"I heard him at the burning bush his swift excuses bring: ""Who, who am I, that I should stand before the Egyptian king? "
231,VISIONS,"""And who am I that I should lead the people of thy choice? My warning word they will not heed, nor hearken to my voice. "
232,VISIONS,"""And who am I that I should move a monarch to relent? I, but a man, and slow of speech, nor wise, nor eloquent."" "
233,VISIONS,"I marked the answer: ""Plead no more thy vain excuse to me; I am the Lord; my servant thou; my glory thou shalt see. "
234,VISIONS,"""I am the Lord; the power is mine; 'tis thine to hear and do; The Lord almighty is to save, by many or by few."" "
235,VISIONS,"The man of doubt exchanged his fears for faith in God and right, While meek obedience on his brow sat like a crown of light. "
236,VISIONS,"The slow of speech grew eloquent, till Israel gladly heard; And bolder waxed the Leader, till the king's hard heart was stirred, "
237,VISIONS,And he in fierce displeasure drove the captives from his land; Not knowing their deliverance was all divinely planned. 
238,VISIONS,"Down the long line of two-score years I looked and saw at last, The blissful view from Pisgah's height; the Jordan safely passed; "
239,VISIONS,"And heard--as Memnon's harp had caught the sweet enchanting strain, And sent adown the waves of time brave Miriam's glad refrain-- "
240,VISIONS,"""Sing, for the Lord hath triumphed; sing, great wonders can he do; The Lord is mighty and can save by many or by few."" "
241,VISIONS,"I saw again, when sin-enslaved, by Jabin's hand oppressed, A people's cry went up to God for rescue and for rest. "
242,VISIONS,"Then up rose Deborah, judge and seer, with all her valiant band, And drove the oppressor from her gates, his chariots from her land. "
243,VISIONS,"And Jael, wife of Heber, slew his captain with the sword; So woman's hand achieved that day the victory for the Lord. "
244,VISIONS,"And woman's voice extolled in song the great Deliverer's name:-- ""Praise God! He hath avenged His own, for willingly they came. "
245,VISIONS,"""The mountains melt before His face, the tribes their strength renew; The Lord is mighty and doth save by many or by few."" "
246,VISIONS,"I saw when Gideon led his band down to the water's bank To prove and set them in array, as man by man they drank, "
247,VISIONS,"And with the handful chosen thus went forth against the foe, And vanquished all the Midian host, and laid their princes low. "
248,VISIONS,"Not with the thousands called from far, who pitched by Harod's well; Nor yet the undismayed who stood when the faint-hearted fell; "
249,VISIONS,"But ""Now, with these three hundred men, go forward,"" said the Lord; ""Do thou thy part, let them do theirs, trust, and obey my word."" "
250,VISIONS,"Their torches flashed like dancing flames, their trumpets loudly blew; Strange warfare! but the Lord can save by many or by few. "
251,VISIONS,"Once more I saw when Israel quailed before Philistia's pride; While great Goliath, day by day, Jehovah's power defied. "
252,VISIONS,"The weak and timid fled away, the valiant shrank with fear;-- 'Twas threatened death or dire defeat, and life and fame are dear. "
253,VISIONS,"Even Saul, their chosen king, forgot (admiring Israel's boast!) That he stood head and shoulders high above his martial host. "
254,VISIONS,"""And are there none,"" he cried, ""who dare to meet this vaunting foe? And must the banner of our God trail in dishonor low?"" "
255,VISIONS,"Then forth there came a ruddy youth: ""That banner I'll defend; Be it not said our God hath none on whom He may depend. "
256,VISIONS,"""Let no heart fail to-day because of this Philistine's boast; The battle is the Lord's and He will vanquish this proud host."" "
257,VISIONS,"Then spake he to the giant foe: ""A loyal servant I Of Israel's God, whose holy name thou darest to defy. "
258,VISIONS,"""In that dread name I charge thee stand, and shield thee as thou may; The fowls of air, the beasts of earth shall feast on thee to-day."" "
259,VISIONS,"'Twas but a pebble from the brook, sent by a loyal will; But sword and spear not mightier were God's purpose to fulfil. "
260,VISIONS,"For one may chase a thousand, and ten thousand flee from two; The God of right is strong to save by many or by few. "

263,VISIONS,"The riches of this goodly land into his coffers pour; Insatiate and unscrupulous, his constant cry is ""More!"" "
264,VISIONS,"""More money clinking in my till, more men--my licensed prey; More _boys_ to feed my traffic when these men have passed away."" "
265,VISIONS,"Thus man is robbed of purse and soul, home of its peace and joy; The wife of husband is bereft, the mother of her boy. "
266,VISIONS,The land doth mourn. On every side the spoiler hath his way; No past oppression hath surpassed this vision of to-day. 
267,VISIONS,"And who, like Moses, will exchange his self-distrust and fear For faith to meet the encroaching foe and check his bold career? "
268,VISIONS,"And who, like Deborah, will arise and lead a valiant band To drive the Tyrant from her gates, the Traffic from her land? "
269,VISIONS,"Who will, like Gideon and his men, the light of truth dare throw On darkest evil, and the trump of coming victory blow? "
270,VISIONS,"Or who, like David, will come forth in God's great name, alone, And lay the boastful giant low, as once with sling and stone? "
271,VISIONS,"When Avarice and unholy Pride against the good contend, The battle is the Lord's and He His people will defend. "
272,VISIONS,"The great Red Sea of wrong, while He doth pass, shall stand aside; Mountains shall bow before Him, and proud Jordan's waves divide. "
273,VISIONS,"Each epoch hath its burning bush, and each its palm-tree shade; And each its oak of Ophrah, where the pledge of peace is made. "
274,VISIONS,"And each its fold, where kingly soul in shepherd guise is found; And when the Master calleth there the place is ""holy ground."" "
275,VISIONS,"Holy the place; but whose the hour? perchance He calleth _thee_, Or _thee_; who, who will answer now, ""Lord, here am I; send me?"" "
276,VISIONS,"O, for the love of land and home, make answer brave and true; Our God is mighty still to save, by many or by few. "

Olive's hill: ""At eventide, at midnight, or at morn, The Son of Man shall come, shall surely come; Be ready, for ye may not know the hour."" And if at eventide, when Nature folds Her toil-spent hands and sinks into repose; Or if at midnight hour of gloom Thou come, Or when the morning spreads her wings of light, Oh make us ready for the solemn call. Supply our need, of knowledge, wisdom, grace, Dear Lord, that with confiding joy our souls, Made pure of sin and strong in faith, may go To meet Thee at Thy coming. If the sound Of sweet home-voices follow to the brink Of death's dark river, as they fainter grow, Then let us hear Thy still small voice of love; Say to us, ""It is I--be not afraid."" Or if the angel of the icy hand Should find us when no human friend is near And summon us away, then as we lose Our hold of earth and fall away from life, O wilt Thou grant our parting spirits may Go out in silence and be found with Thee.

349,FORGIVENESS,"The cruel wrong swept o'er me like a flood; And my hurt soul in fierce defiance rose, And all forgetful that itself could sin Heaped heavy hatred on the offender's head. There came a calmer hour in which I saw The strong temptation that had moved him thus To barter all his better life away-- Love, honor, principle--to gain the world. And seeing this I learned to pity him. For well I knew the bauble he had won Would only mock him with its faithless glare; And well I knew the golden fruit he grasped Would be but dust and ashes in his hand; And knowing this I learned to pity him. And as my pity grew it turned to prayer-- That when the glitter of the gold was gone, And the sweet fruit was bitter to his taste; When the sad memory of the slighted past Came, and made deeper still the present gloom, The darkness might be lifted, and the Soul, Self-robbed and famishing, might find its way To the green pastures and the springs of life, That in the heart whence love and joy had fled, Whence hope was exiled, there might yet be peace. But suddenly I queried in my heart What power had moved me that I should have prayed For him I counted as my life-long foe. Greatly I marveled what it meant that thus I had called down such blessing upon him-- The kindliest boon of heaven, the peace of God. Deep in my soul there came an answering voice: ""O Child, _it is but this--thou hast forgiven_!"" "
350,FORGIVENESS,"Then thanks, O Father, for this plessed hour, Wherein my soul, by Thine own Spirit taught, Prays with no mockery of words Thy prayer: ""Forgive my trespasses, _as I forgive_."" "

353,A LOST SONG?,"Here is fierce anger and hatred and death, Pitiless slaughter of pitiless foe; Blessings and curses poured forth in a breath; Brave self-forgetting, and measureless woe. But where is the song of the angels? O when shall we hear it again? ""Peace on earth,"" rang the chorus seraphic, ""And good will evermore among men."" "
354,A LOST SONG?,"Blue waves of ocean are reddened with gore, Victor and victim earth holds to her breast; Hearts that will thrill with ambition no more; Heads that so lately fond mothers caressed. O where is the song of the angels? O when shall we hear it again? ""Peace on earth,"" rang the chorus seraphic, ""And good will evermore among men."" "
355,A LOST SONG?,"Victory, purchased at infinite cost, Honors and titles so fearfully won, Fame, at the price of lives blighted and lost, Graves, all unnoted, unnumbered, unknown. O where is the song of the angels? Dear Christ, let us hear it again; ""Peace on earth,"" send the chorus seraphic, ""Peace on earth, and good will among men."" "

""Aye, fair the earth,"" she said, ""most fair--and yet How can I for one briefest space forget How dark a stain its loveliness doth mar; A stain, a scourge, the cruel curse of war! Even now I dimly see and faintly hear The clang of drum, the clash of sword and spear."" And pale with pity, swift she shrank away, Leaving the world and war to broader day. "

And yonder, in the islands of the sea, A people struggle vainly to be free; And everywhere the banners of fair fame Trail in the dust of hatred, greed and shame. No crown for Earth; I mourn so bright a star Lost in the chaos of consuming war."" And veiled in robe of woe, he went his way, Borne by the passing hours to close of day. "

But hush! In palace hall a bitter cry; A mangled hero is borne in to die; And in yon lowly cot, a widow's moan;-- A mother's heart-break o'er her only son. Alas! 'tis true. Earth's battle-fields destroy Her noblest manhood; rob her homes of joy."" And sad the Star of Evening sank from sight, While Earth lay shrouded in the gloom of night. "

And also now I recognize The smiling lips and beaming eyes Of some, who, cordial, kind and free, Had smiles and loving words for me. Who, when I entered rose to greet, And welcome gave, sincere and sweet. But that was years ago, and now There may be wrinkles on my brow; There may have fled from form and face The transient charms of youth and grace, And time and sadness may have thrown A shadow o'er the ""chestnut brown"" Of locks that once--well, let that pass;-- These are but sorrowful reflections, And, like those of my looking-glass, Do but discover imperfections; So let us leave this train of thought And start in happier directions. But first I think it may be due Alike unto myself and you, Lest some should think I may have brought My ghostly presence here unsought, To make this note of explanation:-- That not for pride, or praise, or gloom, Or curious motive am I come; Nor yet for want of occupation; Far from intruding thus, I would Have it distinctly understood I'm here by ""special invitation.""
