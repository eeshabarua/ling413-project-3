41,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,
42,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Six hundred years ago, in Dante's time,"
43,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Before his cheek was furrowed by deep rhyme;
44,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"When Europe, fed afresh from Eastern story,"
45,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Was like a garden tangled with the glory
46,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Of flowers hand-planted and of flowers air-sown,"
47,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Climbing and trailing, budding and full-blown,"
48,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Where purple bells are tossed amid pink stars,"
49,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"And springing blades, green troops in innocent wars,"
50,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Crowd every shady spot of teeming earth,"
51,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Making invisible motion visible birth,--"
52,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,
53,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Six hundred years ago, Palermo town"
54,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Kept holiday.  A deed of great renown,"
55,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"A high revenge, had freed it from the yoke"
56,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Of hated Frenchmen; and from Calpe's rock
57,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"To where the Bosporus caught the earlier sun,"
58,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"'Twas told that Pedro, King of Aragon,"
59,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Was welcomed master of all Sicily,--"
60,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"A royal knight, supreme as kings should be"
61,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,In strength and gentleness that make high chivalry.
62,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,
63,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Spain was the favorite home of knightly grace,"
64,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Where generous men rode steeds of generous race;
65,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Both Spanish, yet half Arab; both inspired"
66,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"By mutual spirit, that each motion fired"
67,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"With beauteous response, like minstrelsy"
68,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Afresh fulfilling fresh expectancy.
69,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"So, when Palermo made high festival,"
70,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,The joy of matrons and of maidens all
71,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Was the mock terror of the tournament,"
72,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Where safety, with the glimpse of danger blent,"
73,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Took exaltation as from epic song,"
74,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Which greatly tells the pains that to great life belong.
75,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,
76,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,And in all eyes King Pedro was the king
77,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Of cavaliers; as in a full-gemmed ring
78,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"The largest ruby, or as that bright star"
79,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Whose shining shows us where the Hyads are.
80,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"His the best genet, and he sat it best;"
81,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"His weapon, whether tilting or in rest,"
82,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Was worthiest watching; and his face, once seen,"
83,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Gave to the promise of his royal mien
84,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Such rich fulfilment as the opened eyes
85,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Of a loved sleeper, or the long-watched rise"
86,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Of vernal day, whose joy o'er stream and meadow flies."
87,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,
88,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,But of the maiden forms that thick enwreathed
89,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"The broad piazza, and sweet witchery breathed,"
90,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"With innocent faces budding all arow,"
91,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"From balconies and windows high and low,"
92,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Who was it felt the deep mysterious glow,"
93,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,The impregnation with supernal fire
94,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Of young ideal love, transformed desire,"
95,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Whose passion is but worship of that Best
96,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Taught by the many-mingled creed of each young breast?
97,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,
98,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,{Lady walking through garden: p10.jpg}
99,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,
100,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"'Twas gentle Lisa, of no noble line,"
101,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Child of Bernardo, a rich Florentine,"
102,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Who from his merchant-city hither came
103,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"To trade in drugs; yet kept an honest fame,"
104,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,And had the virtue not to try and sell
105,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Drugs that had none.  He loved his riches well,"
106,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"But loved them chiefly for his Lisa's sake,"
107,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Whom with a father's care he sought to make
108,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"The bride of some true honorable man,--"
109,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Of Perdicone (so the rumor ran),"
110,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Whose birth was higher than his fortunes were,"
111,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,For still your trader likes a mixture fair
112,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Of blood that hurries to some higher strain
113,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Than reckoning money's loss and money's gain.
114,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,And of such mixture good may surely come:
115,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Lord's scions so may learn to cast a sum,"
116,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"A trader's grandson bear a well-set head,"
117,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"And have less conscious manners, better bred;"
118,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Nor, when he tries to be polite, be rude instead."
119,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,
120,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,'Twas Perdicone's friends made overtures
121,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,To good Bernardo; so one dame assures
122,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Her neighbor dame, who notices the youth"
123,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Fixing his eyes on Lisa; and, in truth,"
124,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Eyes that could see her on this summer day
125,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Might find it hard to turn another way.
126,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"She had a pensive beauty, yet not sad;"
127,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Rather like minor cadences that glad
128,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,The hearts of little birds amid spring boughs:
129,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,And oft the trumpet or the joust would rouse
130,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Pulses that gave her cheek a finer glow,"
131,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Parting her lips that seemed a mimic bow
132,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"By chiselling Love for play in coral wrought,"
133,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Then quickened by him with the passionate thought,"
134,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,The soul that trembled in the lustrous night
135,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Of slow long eyes.  Her body was so slight,"
136,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"It seemed she could have floated in the sky,"
137,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,And with the angelic choir made symphony;
138,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"But in her cheek's rich tinge, and in the dark"
139,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Of darkest hair and eyes, she bore a mark"
140,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Of kinship to her generous mother-earth,"
141,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,The fervid land that gives the plumy palm-trees birth.
142,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,
143,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,She saw not Perdicone; her young mind
144,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Dreamed not that any man had ever pined
145,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,For such a little simple maid as she:
146,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,She had but dreamed how heavenly it would be
147,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"To love some hero noble, beauteous, great,"
148,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Who would live stories worthy to narrate,"
149,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Like Roland, or the warriors of Troy,"
150,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"The Cid, or Amadis, or that fair boy"
151,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Who conquered every thing beneath the sun,"
152,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"And somehow, some time, died at Babylon"
153,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Fighting the Moors.  For heroes all were good
154,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,And fair as that archangel who withstood
155,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"The Evil One, the author of all wrong,--"
156,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,That Evil One who made the French so strong;
157,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,And now the flower of heroes must he be
158,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Who drove those tyrants from dear Sicily,"
159,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,So that her maids might walk to vespers tranquilly.
160,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,
161,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Young Lisa saw this hero in the king;
162,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,And as wood-lilies that sweet odors bring
163,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Might dream the light that opes their modest eyne
164,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Was lily-odored; and as rites divine,"
165,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Round turf-laid altars, or 'neath roofs of stone,"
166,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Draw sanctity from out the heart alone
167,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,That loves and worships: so the miniature
168,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Perplexed of her soul's world, all virgin pure,"
169,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Filled with heroic virtues that bright form,"
170,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Raona's royalty, the finished norm"
171,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Of horsemanship, the half of chivalry;"
172,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"For how could generous men avengers be,"
173,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Save as God's messengers on coursers fleet?--
174,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"These, scouring earth, made Spain with Syria meet"
175,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"In one self-world where the same right had sway,"
176,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,And good must grow as grew the blessed day.
177,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,No more: great Love his essence had endued
178,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"With Pedro's form, and, entering, subdued"
179,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"The soul of Lisa, fervid and intense,"
180,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Proud in its choice of proud obedience
181,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,To hardship glorified by perfect reverence.
182,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,
183,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Sweet Lisa homeward carried that dire guest,"
184,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"And in her chamber, through the hours of rest,"
185,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,The darkness was alight for her with sheen
186,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Of arms, and plumed helm; and bright between"
187,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Their commoner gloss, like the pure living spring"
188,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"'Twixt porphyry lips, or living bird's bright wing"
189,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"'Twixt golden wires, the glances of the king"
190,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Flashed on her soul, and waked vibrations there"
191,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Of known delights love-mixed to new and rare:
192,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"The impalpable dream was turned to breathing flesh,"
193,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Chill thought of summer to the warm close mesh
194,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Of sunbeams held between the citron-leaves,"
195,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Clothing her life of life.  Oh! she believes
196,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,That she could be content if he but knew
197,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,(Her poor small self could claim no other due)
198,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,How Lisa's lowly love had highest reach
199,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Of winged passion, whereto winged speech"
200,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Would be scorched remnants left by mounting flame.
201,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Though, had she such lame message, were it blame"
202,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"To tell what greatness dwelt in her, what rank"
203,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,She held in loving?  Modest maidens shrank
204,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,From telling love that fed on selfish hope;
205,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"But love, as hopeless as the shattering song,"
206,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Wailed for loved beings who have joined the throng
207,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Of mighty dead ones. . . .  Nay, but she was weak,"
208,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Knew only prayers and ballads, could not speak"
209,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"With eloquence, save what dumb creatures have,"
210,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,That with small cries and touches small boons crave.
211,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,
212,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,She watched all day that she might see him pass
213,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"With knights and ladies; but she said, ""Alas!"
214,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Though he should see me, it were all as one"
215,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,He saw a pigeon sitting on the stone
216,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Of wall or balcony: some colored spot
217,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"His eye just sees, his mind regardeth not."
218,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,I have no music-touch that could bring nigh
219,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"My love to his soul's hearing.  I shall die,"
220,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"And he will never know who Lisa was,--"
221,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"The trader's child, whose soaring spirit rose"
222,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,As hedge-born aloe-flowers that rarest years disclose.
223,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,
224,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,{Lady seated overlooking garden: p18.jpg}
225,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,
226,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"""For were I now a fair deep-breasted queen"
227,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"A-horseback, with blonde hair, and tunic green,"
228,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Gold-bordered, like Costanza, I should need"
229,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,No change within to make me queenly there:
230,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,For they the royal-hearted women are
231,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Who nobly love the noblest, yet have grace;"
232,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"For needy suffering lives in lowliest place,"
233,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Carrying a choicer sunlight in their smile,"
234,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,The heavenliest ray that pitieth the vile.
235,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"My love is such, it cannot choose but soar"
236,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Up to the highest; yet forevermore,"
237,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Though I were happy, throned beside the king,"
238,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,I should be tender to each little thing
239,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"With hurt warm breast, that had no speech to tell"
240,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Its inward pang; and I would soothe it well
241,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"With tender touch, and with a low soft moan"
242,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"For company: my dumb love-pang is lone,"
243,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Prisoned as topaz-beam within a rough-garbed stone."""
244,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,
245,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"So, inward-wailing, Lisa passed her days."
246,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Each night the August moon with changing phase
247,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Looked broader, harder, on her unchanged pain;"
248,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Each noon the heat lay heavier again
249,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"On her despair, until her body frail"
250,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Shrank like the snow that watchers in the vale
251,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,See narrowed on the height each summer morn;
252,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"While her dark glance burnt larger, more forlorn,"
253,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"As if the soul within her, all on fire,"
254,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Made of her being one swift funeral-pyre.
255,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Father and mother saw with sad dismay
256,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,The meaning of their riches melt away;
257,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,For without Lisa what would sequins buy?
258,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,What wish were left if Lisa were to die?
259,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Through her they cared for summers still to come,"
260,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Else they would be as ghosts without a home
261,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,In any flesh that could feel glad desire.
262,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"They pay the best physicians, never tire"
263,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Of seeking what will soothe her, promising"
264,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"That aught she longed for, though it were a thing"
265,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Hard to be come at as the Indian snow,"
266,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Or roses that on Alpine summits blow,"
267,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"It should be hers.  She answers with low voice,"
268,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,She longs for death alone--death is her choice;
269,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Death is the king who never did think scorn,"
270,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,But rescues every meanest soul to sorrow born.
271,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,
272,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Yet one day, as they bent above her bed,"
273,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"And watched her in brief sleep, her drooping head"
274,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Turned gently, as the thirsty flowers that feel"
275,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Some moist revival through their petals steal;
276,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,And little flutterings of her lids and lips
277,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Told of such dreamy joy as sometimes dips
278,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,A skyey shadow in the mind's poor pool.
279,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"She oped her eyes, and turned their dark gems full"
280,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Upon her father, as in utterance dumb"
281,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Of some new prayer that in her sleep had come.
282,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"""What is it, Lisa?""--""Father, I would see"
283,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Minuccio, the great singer; bring him me."""
284,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"For always, night and day, her unstilled thought,"
285,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Wandering all o'er its little world, had sought"
286,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"How she could reach, by some soft pleading touch,"
287,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"King Pedro's soul, that she who loved so much,"
288,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Dying, might have a place within his mind,--"
289,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,A little grave which he would sometimes find
290,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"And plant some flower on it,--some thought, some memory kind."
291,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,
292,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Till in her dream she saw Minuccio
293,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Touching his viola, and chanting low"
294,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"A strain, that, falling on her brokenly,"
295,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Seemed blossoms lightly blown from off a tree;
296,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Each burthened with a word that was a scent,--"
297,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Raona, Lisa, love, death, tournament;"
298,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Then in her dream she said, ""He sings of me,"
299,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Might be my messenger; ah! now I see
300,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"The king is listening""--Then she awoke,"
301,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"And, missing her dear dream, that new-born longing spoke."
302,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,She longed for music: that was natural;
303,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Physicians said it was medicinal;
304,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,The humors might be schooled by true consent
305,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Of a fine tenor and fine instrument;
306,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"In short, good music, mixed with doctor's stuff,"
307,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Apollo with Asklepios--enough!
308,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Minuccio, entreated, gladly came."
309,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"(He was a singer of most gentle fame,"
310,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"A noble, kindly spirit, not elate"
311,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"That he was famous, but that song was great;"
312,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Would sing as finely to this suffering child
313,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,As at the court where princes on him smiled.)
314,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Gently he entered and sat down by her,"
315,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Asking what sort of strain she would prefer,--"
316,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"The voice alone, or voice with viol wed;"
317,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Then, when she chose the last, he preluded"
318,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"With magic hand, that summoned from the strings"
319,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Aerial spirits, rare yet palpable wings"
320,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"That fanned the pulses of his listener,"
321,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,And waked each sleeping sense with blissful stir.
322,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Her cheek already showed a slow, faint blush;"
323,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"But soon the voice, in pure, full, liquid rush,"
324,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Made all the passion, that till now she felt,"
325,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Seem but as cooler waters that in warmer melt.
326,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,
327,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Finished the song, she prayed to be alone"
328,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,With kind Minuccio; for her faith had grown
329,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,To trust him as if missioned like a priest
330,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"With some high grace, that, when his singing ceased,"
331,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Still made him wiser, more magnanimous,"
332,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Than common men who had no genius.
333,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"So, laying her small hand within his palm,"
334,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"She told him how that secret, glorious harm"
335,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Of loftiest loving had befallen her;
336,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"That death, her only hope, most bitter were,"
337,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"If, when she died, her love must perish too"
338,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"As songs unsung, and thoughts unspoken do,"
339,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Which else might live within another breast.
340,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"She said, ""Minuccio, the grave were rest,"
341,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"If I were sure, that, lying cold and lone,"
342,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"My love, my best of life, had safely flown"
343,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,And nestled in the bosom of the king.
344,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"See, 'tis a small weak bird, with unfledged wing;"
345,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"But you will carry it for me secretly,"
346,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,And bear it to the king; then come to me
347,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"And tell me it is safe, and I shall go"
348,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Content, knowing that he I love my love doth know."""
349,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,
350,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Then she wept silently; but each large tear

358,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,
359,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,He needed not to pause and first devise
360,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,How he should tell the king; for in nowise
361,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Were such love-message worthily bested
362,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Save in fine verse by music rendered.
363,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"He sought a poet-friend, a Siennese,"
364,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"And ""Mico, mine,"" he said, ""full oft to please"
365,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Thy whim of sadness I have sung thee strains
366,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"To make thee weep in verse: now pay my pains,"
367,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"And write me a canzon divinely sad,"
368,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Sinlessly passionate, and meekly mad"

372,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Love-choice of one too high her love to be,--"
373,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,But cannot yield her breath till she has poured
374,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Her strength away in this hot-bleeding word,"
375,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Telling the secret of her soul to her soul's lord."""
376,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,
377,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Said Mico, ""Nay, that thought is poesy,"
378,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,I need but listen as it sings to me.
379,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Come thou again to-morrow.""  The third day,"
380,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"When linked notes had perfected the lay,"
381,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Minuccio had his summons to the court,"
382,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"To make, as he was wont, the moments short"
383,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Of ceremonious dinner to the king.
384,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,This was the time when he had meant to bring
385,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Melodious message of young Lisa's love;
386,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,He waited till the air had ceased to move
387,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"To ringing silver, till Falernian wine"
388,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Made quickened sense with quietude combine;
389,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,And then with passionate descant made each ear incline.

502,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Where strangest fires erewhile had blindly burnt.
503,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,She asked to have her soft white robe and band
504,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,And coral ornaments; and with her hand
505,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"She gave her long dark locks a backward fall,"
506,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Then looked intently in a mirror small,"

515,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Went forth on horseback, and, as if by chance"
516,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Passing Bernardo's house, he paused to glance"
517,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"At the fine garden of this wealthy man,"
518,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,This Tuscan trader turned Palermitan;
519,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"But, presently dismounting, chose to walk"

539,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"A presence as much better than her dreams,"

558,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"The golden yoke, of thoughts too great for me;"
559,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,That was the ground of my infirmity.

562,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,
563,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,The king alone perceived the covert sense
564,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Of all her words, which made one evidence,"
565,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"With her pure voice and candid loveliness,"
566,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"That he had lost much honor, honoring less"
567,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,That message of her passionate distress.

580,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Nor seeks another heaven, nor can bear"
581,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Disturbing pleasures, so was she content,"
582,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Breathing the life of grateful sentiment.
583,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,She thought no maid betrothed could be more blest;
584,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,For treasure must be valued by the test
585,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Of highest excellence and rarity,"
586,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,And her dear joy was best as best could be:
587,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"There seemed no other crown to her delight,"
588,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Now the high loved one saw her love aright.
589,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Thus her soul thriving on that exquisite mood,"
590,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Spread like the May-time all its beauteous good
591,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"O'er the soft bloom of neck and arms and cheek,"
592,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"And strengthened the sweet body, once so weak,"
593,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Until she rose and walked, and, like a bird"
594,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"With sweetly rippling throat, she made her spring joys heard."
595,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,
596,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"The king, when he the happy change had seen,"

600,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Honor this maiden's love, which, like the prayer"
601,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Of loyal hermits, never thought to share"
602,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,In what it gave.  The queen had that chief grace
603,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Of womanhood, a heart that can embrace"

607,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Informed Bernardo that the royal pair
608,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Would straightway visit him, and celebrate"
609,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Their gladness at his daughter's happier state,"
610,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Which they were fain to see.  Soon came the king
611,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"On horseback, with his barons, heralding"
612,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,The advent of the queen in courtly state;
613,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"And all, descending at the garden gate,"
614,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Streamed with their feathers, velvet, and brocade,"
615,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Through the pleached alleys, till they, pausing, made"
616,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,A lake of splendor 'mid the aloes gray;
617,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"When, meekly facing all their proud array,"
618,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"The white-robed Lisa with her parents stood,"
619,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,As some white dove before the gorgeous brood
620,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Of dapple-breasted birds born by the Colchian flood.
621,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"The king and queen, by gracious looks and speech,"
622,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Encourage her, and thus their courtiers teach"
623,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"How, this fair morning, they may courtliest be,"
624,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,By making Lisa pass it happily.
625,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,And soon the ladies and the barons all
626,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Draw her by turns, as at a festival"
627,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Made for her sake, to easy, gay discourse,"
628,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,And compliment with looks and smiles enforce;
629,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,A joyous hum is heard the gardens round;
630,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Soon there is Spanish dancing, and the sound"
631,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Of minstrel's song, and autumn fruits are pluckt;"
632,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Till mindfully the king and queen conduct
633,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,Lisa apart to where a trellised shade
634,D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY,"Made pleasant resting.  Then King Pedro said,--"
