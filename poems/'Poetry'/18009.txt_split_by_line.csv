1319,A VALENTINE.,"Perhaps, as the Belle of the ball-room,"
1320,A VALENTINE.,"She is dancing, nor thinking of me;"
1321,A VALENTINE.,Or riding in front of a small groom;

2896,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,
2897,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,All alone--as a Scholar of Tyrwhitt

2909,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,His eyes were all muddy and black;
2910,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,"And water-snakes, round his neck twining,"
2911,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,Were hissing; and water-rats swam

2913,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,I recognised Old Father Cam.
2914,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,
2915,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,"""All hail to thee, Camus the reedy!"""

2921,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,"My prospects, alas! look but badly;"

2930,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,For who can row well in a sewer;
2931,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,"Or pull through miasma and slime?"""
2932,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,
2933,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,Thus murmured the River-god moaning;
2934,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,But I bade him to dry his old eye--

2946,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,"For WATNEY is wiry and plucky,"

2964,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,"Our 'Stroke,' people say, on the feather"
2965,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,Is a trifle too fond of a pause;
2966,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,"But while some say, 'there's nothing like leather,'"
2967,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,I maintain there is nothing like LAWES.
2968,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,
2969,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,"""Washerwomen, not over aquatic,"
2970,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,Says he rows 'like a mangle'--what trash!
2971,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,That his swing and his time are erratic;
2972,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,That he puts in his oar with a splash.
2973,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,"But these wonderful judges of rowing,"
2974,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,If we win will be loud in applause;

3103,CAMBRIDGE.,"Cambridge men agree,"
3104,CAMBRIDGE.,Their voice to raise in their Captain's praise
3105,CAMBRIDGE.,with thrice and three times three.

3216,THE TWO MAIDENS.,
3217,THE TWO MAIDENS.,
3218,THE TWO MAIDENS.,[The following Verses were written for a country Penny Reading].
3219,THE TWO MAIDENS.,
3220,THE TWO MAIDENS.,Two Bedfordshire maidens in one village dwelt;
3221,THE TWO MAIDENS.,Side by side in their Church every Sunday they knelt;
3222,THE TWO MAIDENS.,They were not very pretty and not very plain;
3223,THE TWO MAIDENS.,And their names were Eliza and Emily Jane.
3224,THE TWO MAIDENS.,
3225,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"Now Carpenter Smith was young, steady and still,"
3226,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"And wherever he went, worked and played with a will:"
3227,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"To bed he went early, and early did rise;"
3228,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"So, of course, he was healthy, and wealthy, and wise."
3229,THE TWO MAIDENS.,
3230,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"But John he grew tired of a bachelor's life,"
3231,THE TWO MAIDENS.,So he looked all around him in search of a wife;
3232,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"And his eyes, as they wandered, again and again"
3233,THE TWO MAIDENS.,Returned to Eliza and Emily Jane.
3234,THE TWO MAIDENS.,
3235,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"And whenever those maidens encountered his eye,"
3236,THE TWO MAIDENS.,Their pulses beat quickly (perhaps you know _why_);
3237,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"They each of them thought him a wonderful Don,"
3238,THE TWO MAIDENS.,And wished to be married to Carpenter John.
3239,THE TWO MAIDENS.,
3240,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"But John, as you've heard, was a prudent young man;"
3241,THE TWO MAIDENS.,And determined their faults and their merits to scan;
3242,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"Says he, ""If I marry, I'm tied for my life;"
3243,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"""So it's well to be cautious in choosing a wife."""
3244,THE TWO MAIDENS.,
3245,THE TWO MAIDENS.,Now I'm sorry to say that young Emily Jane
3246,THE TWO MAIDENS.,Was disposed to be rather conceited and vain;
3247,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"In fact, for the truth I'm obliged to confess,"
3248,THE TWO MAIDENS.,Was decidedly fond of extravagant dress.
3249,THE TWO MAIDENS.,
3250,THE TWO MAIDENS.,So she thought the best way to the Carpenter's heart
3251,THE TWO MAIDENS.,Was to purchase gay dresses and finery smart;
3252,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"In the carrier's van off to Bedford she went,"
3253,THE TWO MAIDENS.,And many weeks' wages in finery spent.
3254,THE TWO MAIDENS.,
3255,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"Her dress it was blue, and her ribbons were green,"
3256,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"And her chignon the highest that ever was seen,"
3257,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"And perched on the top, heavy-laden with flowers,"
3258,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"Was a bonnet, embosomed in beautiful bowers."
3259,THE TWO MAIDENS.,
3260,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"So red, as she walked to the Church, was her shawl"
3261,THE TWO MAIDENS.,That the bull in the farm-yard did bellow and bawl;
3262,THE TWO MAIDENS.,And so high were her heels that on entering the door
3263,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"She slipped, and she stumbled, and fell on the floor."
3264,THE TWO MAIDENS.,
3265,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"Says Carpenter Smith, ""It's decidedly plain"
3266,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"""That I'd better keep clear of that Emily Jane:"""
3267,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"So from Emily Jane he averted his eye,"
3268,THE TWO MAIDENS.,And just at that moment Eliza passed by.
3269,THE TWO MAIDENS.,
3270,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"Now Eliza had thought, ""If his heart I subdue,"
3271,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"""It shall not be by dresses and finery new:"
3272,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"""For a lover who's taken by ornaments gay"
3273,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"""Will love some one else ere a week pass away."""
3274,THE TWO MAIDENS.,
3275,THE TWO MAIDENS.,So her ribbons were lilac; white straw was her bonnet;
3276,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"Her dress was light grey, with dark braiding upon it;"
3277,THE TWO MAIDENS.,Her jacket was black; and her boots of stout leather
3278,THE TWO MAIDENS.,Were fitted for walking in all sorts of weather.
3279,THE TWO MAIDENS.,
3280,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"She was not very pretty, and yet in her smile"
3281,THE TWO MAIDENS.,There was something that charmed by its freedom from guile:
3282,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"And tho' lowly her lot, yet her natural grace"
3283,THE TWO MAIDENS.,Made her look like a lady in figure and face.
3284,THE TWO MAIDENS.,
3285,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"A rose from the garden she wore on her breast,"
3286,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"And John, as her fingers he tenderly press'd,"
3287,THE TWO MAIDENS.,Seemed to feel a sharp arrow ('twas Cupid's first dart)
3288,THE TWO MAIDENS.,Come straight from the rosebud and enter his heart.
3289,THE TWO MAIDENS.,
3290,THE TWO MAIDENS.,Now John and Eliza are husband and wife;
3291,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"Their quarrels are few, and contented their life;"
3292,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"They eat and they drink and they dress in good taste,"
3293,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"For their money they spend on their wants, not in waste."
3294,THE TWO MAIDENS.,
3295,THE TWO MAIDENS.,But I'm sorry to say that Miss Emily Jane
3296,THE TWO MAIDENS.,Has still an aversion to dress that is plain;
3297,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"And the consequence is that she always has stayed,"
3298,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"And is likely to stay, a disconsolate maid."

3305,MORAL.,"If you're pretty, fine dress is not needed to show it;"
3306,MORAL.,"If you're ugly, fine dress will make all the world know it."

3500,FRED AND BILL.,
3501,FRED AND BILL.,"To the Penny Bank weekly his savings he took,"

3505,FRED AND BILL.,
3506,FRED AND BILL.,"And so he got on; he was no millionaire,"

3510,FRED AND BILL.,
3511,FRED AND BILL.,"His brother, meantime, who was thought to be dead,"

3516,FRED AND BILL.,"He might have done well, but wherever he went,"

3524,FRED AND BILL.,He managed to make fifteen hundred pounds clear.
3525,FRED AND BILL.,
3526,FRED AND BILL.,"Then he thought of old England and Bedfordshire chums,"
3527,FRED AND BILL.,So back to his parish in triumph he comes;
3528,FRED AND BILL.,And need I remark he found many a friend
3529,FRED AND BILL.,Right willing to help him his nuggets to spend?
3530,FRED AND BILL.,
3531,FRED AND BILL.,"He turned up his nose at his poor brother Bill,"
3532,FRED AND BILL.,Who was always content to be plodding up hill;

3536,FRED AND BILL.,There was never a horse-race but Fred he was there;
3537,FRED AND BILL.,"He went to each meet, meeting, marker and fair;"
3538,FRED AND BILL.,"In a few words, his candle he burnt to the socket,"
3539,FRED AND BILL.,Till he found one fine day not a rap in His pocket.
3540,FRED AND BILL.,
3541,FRED AND BILL.,Then his poor brother Bill came and lent him a hand;
3542,FRED AND BILL.,Gave him work and a share of his own bit of land;
3543,FRED AND BILL.,If he means to keep steady I cannot surmise--
3544,FRED AND BILL.,Let us hope that at length Fred has learnt to be wise.
3545,FRED AND BILL.,
3546,FRED AND BILL.,"But one thing is plain, if you mean to get on,"
3547,FRED AND BILL.,You will find that success must by patience be won;
3548,FRED AND BILL.,"In the battle of life do not trust to your luck,"
3549,FRED AND BILL.,"But to honest hard work, perseverance, and pluck."
3550,FRED AND BILL.,
3551,FRED AND BILL.,"Don't turn up your nose at a hard-working chap,"
3552,FRED AND BILL.,For pride soon or later must meet with mishap;
3553,FRED AND BILL.,"And wherever your lot in the world may be cast,"
3554,FRED AND BILL.,"""Slow and steady"" goes safer than ""foolish and fast."""
3555,FRED AND BILL.,
3556,FRED AND BILL.,"Take warning by Fred, and avoid for a friend"
3557,FRED AND BILL.,The man who would tempt you your savings to spend;
3558,FRED AND BILL.,"Don't waste your spare money in riotous pranks,"
3559,FRED AND BILL.,"But put it in Penny, or Post-office Banks."

3646,"HOME, SWEET HOME.",But the wust of it all wor the dressin' I got
3647,"HOME, SWEET HOME.","From Polly--oh, worn't it main spicy and hot?"
