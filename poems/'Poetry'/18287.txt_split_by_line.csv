129,THALASSIUS,
130,THALASSIUS,
131,THALASSIUS,"Upon the flowery forefront of the year,"
132,THALASSIUS,One wandering by the grey-green April sea
133,THALASSIUS,Found on a reach of shingle and shallower sand
134,THALASSIUS,Inlaid with starrier glimmering jewellery
135,THALASSIUS,Left for the sun's love and the light wind's cheer
136,THALASSIUS,Along the foam-flowered strand
137,THALASSIUS,"Breeze-brightened, something nearer sea than land"
138,THALASSIUS,"Though the last shoreward blossom-fringe was near,"
139,THALASSIUS,A babe asleep with flower-soft face that gleamed
140,THALASSIUS,"To sun and seaward as it laughed and dreamed,"
141,THALASSIUS,"Too sure of either love for either's fear,"
142,THALASSIUS,"Albeit so birdlike slight and light, it seemed"
143,THALASSIUS,"Nor man nor mortal child of man, but fair"
144,THALASSIUS,"As even its twin-born tenderer spray-flowers were,"
145,THALASSIUS,That the wind scatters like an Oread's hair.
146,THALASSIUS,
147,THALASSIUS,For when July strewed fire on earth and sea
148,THALASSIUS,"The last time ere that year,"
149,THALASSIUS,Out of the flame of morn Cymothoe
150,THALASSIUS,Beheld one brighter than the sunbright sphere
151,THALASSIUS,"Move toward her from its fieriest heart, whence trod"
152,THALASSIUS,"The live sun's very God,"
153,THALASSIUS,Across the foam-bright water-ways that are
154,THALASSIUS,"As heavenlier heavens with star for answering star,"
155,THALASSIUS,And on her eyes and hair and maiden mouth
156,THALASSIUS,Felt a kiss falling fierier than the South
157,THALASSIUS,And heard above afar
158,THALASSIUS,A noise of songs and wind-enamoured wings
159,THALASSIUS,"And lutes and lyres of milder and mightier strings,"
160,THALASSIUS,And round the resonant radiance of his car
161,THALASSIUS,"Where depth is one with height,"
162,THALASSIUS,"Light heard as music, music seen as light."
163,THALASSIUS,And with that second moondawn of the spring's
164,THALASSIUS,"That fosters the first rose,"
165,THALASSIUS,A sun-child whiter than the sunlit snows
166,THALASSIUS,Was born out of the world of sunless things
167,THALASSIUS,That round the round earth flows and ebbs and flows.
168,THALASSIUS,
169,THALASSIUS,But he that found the sea-flower by the sea
170,THALASSIUS,And took to foster like a graft of earth
171,THALASSIUS,"Was born of man's most highest and heavenliest birth,"
172,THALASSIUS,Free-born as winds and stars and waves are free;
173,THALASSIUS,"A warrior grey with glories more than years,"
174,THALASSIUS,Though more of years than change the quick to dead
175,THALASSIUS,Had rained their light and darkness on his head;
176,THALASSIUS,A singer that in time's and memory's ears
177,THALASSIUS,Should leave such words to sing as all his peers
178,THALASSIUS,Might praise with hallowing heat of rapturous tears
179,THALASSIUS,Till all the days of human flight were fled.
180,THALASSIUS,And at his knees his fosterling was fed
181,THALASSIUS,Not with man's wine and bread
182,THALASSIUS,"Nor mortal mother-milk of hopes and fears,"
183,THALASSIUS,But food of deep memorial days long sped;
184,THALASSIUS,For bread with wisdom and with song for wine
185,THALASSIUS,Clear as the full calm's emerald hyaline.
186,THALASSIUS,And from his grave glad lips the boy would gather
187,THALASSIUS,"Fine honey of song-notes goldener than gold,"
188,THALASSIUS,"More sweet than bees make of the breathing heather,"
189,THALASSIUS,"That he, as glad and bold,"
190,THALASSIUS,"Might drink as they, and keep his spirit from cold."
191,THALASSIUS,And the boy loved his laurel-laden hair
192,THALASSIUS,"As his own father's risen on the eastern air,"
193,THALASSIUS,And that less white brow-binding bayleaf bloom
194,THALASSIUS,More than all flowers his father's eyes relume;
195,THALASSIUS,"And those high songs he heard,"
196,THALASSIUS,"More than all notes of any landward bird,"
197,THALASSIUS,More than all sounds less free
198,THALASSIUS,Than the wind's quiring to the choral sea.
199,THALASSIUS,
200,THALASSIUS,High things the high song taught him; how the breath
201,THALASSIUS,Too frail for life may be more strong than death;
202,THALASSIUS,"And this poor flash of sense in life, that gleams"
203,THALASSIUS,"As a ghost's glory in dreams,"
204,THALASSIUS,"More stabile than the world's own heart's root seems,"
205,THALASSIUS,By that strong faith of lordliest love which gives
206,THALASSIUS,To death's own sightless-seeming eyes a light
207,THALASSIUS,"Clearer, to death's bare bones a verier might,"
208,THALASSIUS,Than shines or strikes from any man that lives.
209,THALASSIUS,How he that loves life overmuch shall die
210,THALASSIUS,"The dog's death, utterly:"
211,THALASSIUS,And he that much less loves it than he hates
212,THALASSIUS,All wrongdoing that is done
213,THALASSIUS,Anywhere always underneath the sun
214,THALASSIUS,Shall live a mightier life than time's or fate's.
215,THALASSIUS,"One fairer thing he shewed him, and in might"
216,THALASSIUS,More strong than day and night
217,THALASSIUS,Whose strengths build up time's towering period:
218,THALASSIUS,"Yea, one thing stronger and more high than God,"
219,THALASSIUS,"Which if man had not, then should God not be:"
220,THALASSIUS,And that was Liberty.
221,THALASSIUS,"And gladly should man die to gain, he said,"
222,THALASSIUS,"Freedom; and gladlier, having lost, lie dead."
223,THALASSIUS,"For man's earth was not, nor the sweet sea-waves"
224,THALASSIUS,"His, nor his own land, nor its very graves,"
225,THALASSIUS,"Except they bred not, bore not, hid not slaves:"
226,THALASSIUS,"But all of all that is,"
227,THALASSIUS,"Were one man free in body and soul, were his."
228,THALASSIUS,
229,THALASSIUS,"And the song softened, even as heaven by night"
230,THALASSIUS,"Softens, from sunnier down to starrier light,"
231,THALASSIUS,And with its moonbright breath
232,THALASSIUS,"Blessed life for death's sake, and for life's sake death."
233,THALASSIUS,Till as the moon's own beam and breath confuse
234,THALASSIUS,In one clear hueless haze of glimmering hues
235,THALASSIUS,"The sea's line and the land's line and the sky's,"
236,THALASSIUS,"And light for love of darkness almost dies,"
237,THALASSIUS,"As darkness only lives for light's dear love,"
238,THALASSIUS,"Whose hands the web of night is woven of,"
239,THALASSIUS,So in that heaven of wondrous words were life
240,THALASSIUS,And death brought out of strife;
241,THALASSIUS,"Yea, by that strong spell of serene increase"
242,THALASSIUS,Brought out of strife to peace.
243,THALASSIUS,
244,THALASSIUS,"And the song lightened, as the wind at morn"
245,THALASSIUS,"Flashes, and even with lightning of the wind"
246,THALASSIUS,Night's thick-spun web is thinned
247,THALASSIUS,And all its weft unwoven and overworn
248,THALASSIUS,"Shrinks, as might love from scorn."
249,THALASSIUS,And as when wind and light on water and land
250,THALASSIUS,"Leap as twin gods from heavenward hand in hand,"
251,THALASSIUS,And with the sound and splendour of their leap
252,THALASSIUS,"Strike darkness dead, and daunt the spirit of sleep,"
253,THALASSIUS,And burn it up with fire;
254,THALASSIUS,So with the light that lightened from the lyre
255,THALASSIUS,Was all the bright heat in the child's heart stirred
256,THALASSIUS,And blown with blasts of music into flame
257,THALASSIUS,Till even his sense became
258,THALASSIUS,"Fire, as the sense that fires the singing bird"
259,THALASSIUS,Whose song calls night by name.
260,THALASSIUS,And in the soul within the sense began
261,THALASSIUS,"The manlike passion of a godlike man,"
262,THALASSIUS,And in the sense within the soul again
263,THALASSIUS,Thoughts that make men of gods and gods of men.
264,THALASSIUS,
265,THALASSIUS,For love the high song taught him: love that turns
266,THALASSIUS,God's heart toward man as man's to Godward; love
267,THALASSIUS,"That life and death and life are fashioned of,"
268,THALASSIUS,From the first breath that burns
269,THALASSIUS,"Half kindled on the flowerlike yeanling's lip,"
270,THALASSIUS,"So light and faint that life seems like to slip,"
271,THALASSIUS,To that yet weaklier drawn
272,THALASSIUS,When sunset dies of night's devouring dawn.
273,THALASSIUS,But the man dying not wholly as all men dies
274,THALASSIUS,If aught be left of his in live men's eyes
275,THALASSIUS,Out of the dawnless dark of death to rise;
276,THALASSIUS,If aught of deed or word
277,THALASSIUS,Be seen for all time or of all time heard.
278,THALASSIUS,"Love, that though body and soul were overthrown"
279,THALASSIUS,"Should live for love's sake of itself alone,"
280,THALASSIUS,"Though spirit and flesh were one thing doomed and dead,"
281,THALASSIUS,Not wholly annihilated.
282,THALASSIUS,Seeing even the hoariest ash-flake that the pyre
283,THALASSIUS,"Drops, and forgets the thing was once afire"
284,THALASSIUS,And gave its heart to feed the pile's full flame
285,THALASSIUS,"Till its own heart its own heat overcame,"
286,THALASSIUS,"Outlives its own life, though by scarce a span,"
287,THALASSIUS,"As such men dying outlive themselves in man,"
288,THALASSIUS,Outlive themselves for ever; if the heat
289,THALASSIUS,"Outburn the heart that kindled it, the sweet"
290,THALASSIUS,"Outlast the flower whose soul it was, and flit"
291,THALASSIUS,Forth of the body of it
292,THALASSIUS,Into some new shape of a strange perfume
293,THALASSIUS,"More potent than its light live spirit of bloom,"
294,THALASSIUS,"How shall not something of that soul relive,"
295,THALASSIUS,That only soul that had such gifts to give
296,THALASSIUS,As lighten something even of all men's doom
297,THALASSIUS,Even from the labouring womb
298,THALASSIUS,Even to the seal set on the unopening tomb?
299,THALASSIUS,And these the loving light of song and love
300,THALASSIUS,"Shall wrap and lap round and impend above,"
301,THALASSIUS,Imperishable; and all springs born illume
302,THALASSIUS,Their sleep with brighter thoughts than wake the dove
303,THALASSIUS,"To music, when the hillside winds resume"
304,THALASSIUS,The marriage-song of heather-flower and broom
305,THALASSIUS,And all the joy thereof.
306,THALASSIUS,
307,THALASSIUS,And hate the song too taught him: hate of all
308,THALASSIUS,That brings or holds in thrall
309,THALASSIUS,"Of spirit or flesh, free-born ere God began,"
310,THALASSIUS,The holy body and sacred soul of man.
311,THALASSIUS,"And wheresoever a curse was or a chain,"
312,THALASSIUS,A throne for torment or a crown for bane
313,THALASSIUS,"Rose, moulded out of poor men's molten pain,"
314,THALASSIUS,"There, said he, should man's heaviest hate be set"
315,THALASSIUS,"Inexorably, to faint not or forget"
316,THALASSIUS,Till the last warmth bled forth of the last vein
317,THALASSIUS,"In flesh that none should call a king's again,"
318,THALASSIUS,Seeing wolves and dogs and birds that plague-strike air
319,THALASSIUS,Leave the last bone of all the carrion bare.
320,THALASSIUS,
321,THALASSIUS,And hope the high song taught him: hope whose eyes
322,THALASSIUS,"Can sound the seas unsoundable, the skies"
323,THALASSIUS,Inaccessible of eyesight; that can see
324,THALASSIUS,"What earth beholds not, hear what wind and sea"
325,THALASSIUS,"Hear not, and speak what all these crying in one"
326,THALASSIUS,Can speak not to the sun.
327,THALASSIUS,For in her sovereign eyelight all things are
328,THALASSIUS,Clear as the closest seen and kindlier star
329,THALASSIUS,That marries morn and even and winter and spring
330,THALASSIUS,With one love's golden ring.
331,THALASSIUS,"For she can see the days of man, the birth"
332,THALASSIUS,Of good and death of evil things on earth
333,THALASSIUS,"Inevitable and infinite, and sure"
334,THALASSIUS,"As present pain is, or herself is pure."
335,THALASSIUS,"Yea, she can hear and see, beyond all things"
336,THALASSIUS,That lighten from before Time's thunderous wings
337,THALASSIUS,"Through the awful circle of wheel-winged periods,"
338,THALASSIUS,The tempest of the twilight of all Gods:
339,THALASSIUS,And higher than all the circling course they ran
340,THALASSIUS,The sundawn of the spirit that was man.
341,THALASSIUS,
342,THALASSIUS,And fear the song too taught him; fear to be
343,THALASSIUS,Worthless the dear love of the wind and sea
344,THALASSIUS,"That bred him fearless, like a sea-mew reared"
345,THALASSIUS,"In rocks of man's foot feared,"
346,THALASSIUS,Where nought of wingless life may sing or shine.
347,THALASSIUS,Fear to wax worthless of that heaven he had
348,THALASSIUS,When all the life in all his limbs was glad
349,THALASSIUS,And all the drops in all his veins were wine
350,THALASSIUS,"And all the pulses music; when his heart,"
351,THALASSIUS,"Singing, bade heaven and wind and sea bear part"
352,THALASSIUS,"In one live song's reiterance, and they bore:"
353,THALASSIUS,Fear to go crownless of the flower he wore
354,THALASSIUS,"When the winds loved him and the waters knew,"
355,THALASSIUS,The blithest life that clove their blithe life through
356,THALASSIUS,"With living limbs exultant, or held strife"
357,THALASSIUS,More amorous than all dalliance aye anew
358,THALASSIUS,"With the bright breath and strength of their large life,"
359,THALASSIUS,"With all strong wrath of all sheer winds that blew,"
360,THALASSIUS,All glories of all storms of the air that fell
361,THALASSIUS,"Prone, ineluctable,"
362,THALASSIUS,"With roar from heaven of revel, and with hue"
363,THALASSIUS,As of a heaven turned hell.
364,THALASSIUS,For when the red blast of their breath had made
365,THALASSIUS,"All heaven aflush with light more dire than shade,"
366,THALASSIUS,He felt it in his blood and eyes and hair
367,THALASSIUS,Burn as if all the fires of the earth and air
368,THALASSIUS,"Had laid strong hold upon his flesh, and stung"
369,THALASSIUS,"The soul behind it as with serpent's tongue,"
370,THALASSIUS,Forked like the loveliest lightnings: nor could bear
371,THALASSIUS,"But hardly, half distraught with strong delight,"
372,THALASSIUS,The joy that like a garment wrapped him round
373,THALASSIUS,And lapped him over and under
374,THALASSIUS,With raiment of great light
375,THALASSIUS,And rapture of great sound
376,THALASSIUS,At every loud leap earthward of the thunder
377,THALASSIUS,From heaven's most furthest bound:
378,THALASSIUS,"So seemed all heaven in hearing and in sight,"
379,THALASSIUS,"Alive and mad with glory and angry joy,"
380,THALASSIUS,That something of its marvellous mirth and might
381,THALASSIUS,"Moved even to madness, fledged as even for flight,"
382,THALASSIUS,The blood and spirit of one but mortal boy.
383,THALASSIUS,
384,THALASSIUS,"So, clothed with love and fear that love makes great,"
385,THALASSIUS,"And armed with hope and hate,"
386,THALASSIUS,He set first foot upon the spring-flowered ways
387,THALASSIUS,That all feet pass and praise.
388,THALASSIUS,"And one dim dawn between the winter and spring,"
389,THALASSIUS,In the sharp harsh wind harrying heaven and earth
390,THALASSIUS,To put back April that had borne his birth
391,THALASSIUS,"From sunward on her sunniest shower-struck wing,"
392,THALASSIUS,"With tears and laughter for the dew-dropt thing,"
393,THALASSIUS,"Slight as indeed a dew-drop, by the sea"
394,THALASSIUS,"One met him lovelier than all men may be,"
395,THALASSIUS,"God-featured, with god's eyes; and in their might"
396,THALASSIUS,"Somewhat that drew men's own to mar their sight,"
397,THALASSIUS,Even of all eyes drawn toward him: and his mouth
398,THALASSIUS,"Was as the very rose of all men's youth,"
399,THALASSIUS,One rose of all the rose-beds in the world:
400,THALASSIUS,"But round his brows the curls were snakes that curled,"
401,THALASSIUS,And like his tongue a serpent's; and his voice
402,THALASSIUS,"Speaks death, and bids rejoice."
403,THALASSIUS,"Yet then he spake no word, seeming as dumb,"
404,THALASSIUS,A dumb thing mild and hurtless; nor at first
405,THALASSIUS,"From his bowed eyes seemed any light to come,"
406,THALASSIUS,Nor his meek lips for blood or tears to thirst:
407,THALASSIUS,But as one blind and mute in mild sweet wise
408,THALASSIUS,"Pleading for pity of piteous lips and eyes,"
409,THALASSIUS,He strayed with faint bare lily-lovely feet
410,THALASSIUS,"Helpless, and flowerlike sweet:"
411,THALASSIUS,"Nor might man see, not having word hereof,"
412,THALASSIUS,That this of all gods was the great god Love.
413,THALASSIUS,
414,THALASSIUS,And seeing him lovely and like a little child
415,THALASSIUS,That wellnigh wept for wonder that it smiled
416,THALASSIUS,"And was so feeble and fearful, with soft speech"
417,THALASSIUS,The youth bespake him softly; but there fell
418,THALASSIUS,From the sweet lips no sweet word audible
419,THALASSIUS,That ear or thought might reach:
420,THALASSIUS,"No sound to make the dim cold silence glad,"
421,THALASSIUS,No breath to thaw the hard harsh air with heat;
422,THALASSIUS,"Only the saddest smile of all things sweet,"
423,THALASSIUS,Only the sweetest smile of all things sad.
424,THALASSIUS,
425,THALASSIUS,And so they went together one green way
426,THALASSIUS,Till April dying made free the world for May;
427,THALASSIUS,"And on his guide suddenly Love's face turned,"
428,THALASSIUS,And in his blind eyes burned
429,THALASSIUS,Hard light and heat of laughter; and like flame
430,THALASSIUS,That opens in a mountain's ravening mouth
431,THALASSIUS,"To blear and sear the sunlight from the south,"
432,THALASSIUS,"His mute mouth opened, and his first word came:"
433,THALASSIUS,'Knowest thou me now by name?'
434,THALASSIUS,"And all his stature waxed immeasurable,"
435,THALASSIUS,As of one shadowing heaven and lightening hell;
436,THALASSIUS,And statelier stood he than a tower that stands
437,THALASSIUS,And darkens with its darkness far-off sands
438,THALASSIUS,Whereon the sky leans red;
439,THALASSIUS,And with a voice that stilled the winds he said:
440,THALASSIUS,"'I am he that was thy lord before thy birth,"
441,THALASSIUS,I am he that is thy lord till thou turn earth:
442,THALASSIUS,"I make the night more dark, and all the morrow"
443,THALASSIUS,Dark as the night whose darkness was my breath:
444,THALASSIUS,"O fool, my name is sorrow;"
445,THALASSIUS,"Thou fool, my name is death.'"
446,THALASSIUS,
447,THALASSIUS,"And he that heard spake not, and looked right on"
448,THALASSIUS,"Again, and Love was gone."
449,THALASSIUS,
450,THALASSIUS,Through many a night toward many a wearier day
451,THALASSIUS,His spirit bore his body down its way.
452,THALASSIUS,Through many a day toward many a wearier night
453,THALASSIUS,His soul sustained his sorrows in her sight.
454,THALASSIUS,"And earth was bitter, and heaven, and even the sea"
455,THALASSIUS,Sorrowful even as he.
456,THALASSIUS,"And the wind helped not, and the sun was dumb;"
457,THALASSIUS,And with too long strong stress of grief to be
458,THALASSIUS,His heart grew sere and numb.
459,THALASSIUS,
460,THALASSIUS,And one bright eve ere summer in autumn sank
461,THALASSIUS,At stardawn standing on a grey sea-bank
462,THALASSIUS,He felt the wind fitfully shift and heave
463,THALASSIUS,As toward a stormier eve;
464,THALASSIUS,And all the wan wide sea shuddered; and earth
465,THALASSIUS,"Shook underfoot as toward some timeless birth,"
466,THALASSIUS,Intolerable and inevitable; and all
467,THALASSIUS,"Heaven, darkling, trembled like a stricken thrall."
468,THALASSIUS,"And far out of the quivering east, and far"
469,THALASSIUS,"From past the moonrise and its guiding star,"
470,THALASSIUS,Began a noise of tempest and a light
471,THALASSIUS,That was not of the lightning; and a sound
472,THALASSIUS,Rang with it round and round
473,THALASSIUS,That was not of the thunder; and a flight
474,THALASSIUS,"As of blown clouds by night,"
475,THALASSIUS,That was not of them; and with songs and cries
476,THALASSIUS,That sang and shrieked their soul out at the skies
477,THALASSIUS,A shapeless earthly storm of shapes began
478,THALASSIUS,"From all ways round to move in on the man,"
479,THALASSIUS,Clamorous against him silent; and their feet
480,THALASSIUS,"Were as the wind's are fleet,"
481,THALASSIUS,And their shrill songs were as wild birds' are sweet.
482,THALASSIUS,
483,THALASSIUS,And as when all the world of earth was wronged
484,THALASSIUS,And all the host of all men driven afoam
485,THALASSIUS,"By the red hand of Rome,"
486,THALASSIUS,Round some fierce amphitheatre overthronged
487,THALASSIUS,With fair clear faces full of bloodier lust
488,THALASSIUS,Than swells and stings the tiger when his mood
489,THALASSIUS,Is fieriest after blood
490,THALASSIUS,And drunk with trampling of the murderous must
491,THALASSIUS,That soaks and stains the tortuous close-coiled wood
492,THALASSIUS,"Made monstrous with its myriad-mustering brood,"
493,THALASSIUS,"Face by fair face panted and gleamed and pressed,"
494,THALASSIUS,And breast by passionate breast
495,THALASSIUS,"Heaved hot with ravenous rapture, as they quaffed"
496,THALASSIUS,"The red ripe full fume of the deep live draught,"
497,THALASSIUS,"The sharp quick reek of keen fresh bloodshed, blown"
498,THALASSIUS,Through the dense deep drift up to the emperor's throne
499,THALASSIUS,From the under steaming sands
500,THALASSIUS,"With clamour of all-applausive throats and hands,"
501,THALASSIUS,Mingling in mirthful time
502,THALASSIUS,With shrill blithe mockeries of the lithe-limbed mime:
503,THALASSIUS,"So from somewhence far forth of the unbeholden,"
504,THALASSIUS,"Dreadfully driven from over and after and under,"
505,THALASSIUS,"Fierce, blown through fifes of brazen blast and golden,"
506,THALASSIUS,With sound of chiming waves that drown the thunder
507,THALASSIUS,"Or thunder that strikes dumb the sea's own chimes,"
508,THALASSIUS,"Began the bellowing of the bull-voiced mimes,"
509,THALASSIUS,Terrible; firs bowed down as briars or palms
510,THALASSIUS,Even at the breathless blast as of a breeze
511,THALASSIUS,Fulfilled with clamour and clangour and storms of psalms;
512,THALASSIUS,"Red hands rent up the roots of old-world trees,"
513,THALASSIUS,Thick flames of torches tossed as tumbling seas
514,THALASSIUS,Made mad the moonless and infuriate air
515,THALASSIUS,"That, ravening, revelled in the riotous hair"
516,THALASSIUS,And raiment of the furred Bassarides.
517,THALASSIUS,
518,THALASSIUS,"So came all those in on him; and his heart,"
519,THALASSIUS,"As out of sleep suddenly struck astart,"
520,THALASSIUS,"Danced, and his flesh took fire of theirs, and grief"
521,THALASSIUS,Was as a last year's leaf
522,THALASSIUS,Blown dead far down the wind's way; and he set
523,THALASSIUS,His pale mouth to the brightest mouth it met
524,THALASSIUS,"That laughed for love against his lips, and bade"
525,THALASSIUS,Follow; and in following all his blood grew glad
526,THALASSIUS,And as again a sea-bird's; for the wind
527,THALASSIUS,Took him to bathe him deep round breast and brow
528,THALASSIUS,"Not as it takes a dead leaf drained and thinned,"
529,THALASSIUS,"But as the brightest bay-flower blown on bough,"
530,THALASSIUS,Set springing toward it singing: and they rode
531,THALASSIUS,"By many a vine-leafed, many a rose-hung road,"
532,THALASSIUS,Exalt with exultation; many a night
533,THALASSIUS,Set all its stars upon them as for spies
534,THALASSIUS,On many a moon-bewildering mountain-height
535,THALASSIUS,Where he rode only by the fierier light
536,THALASSIUS,Of his dread lady's hot sweet hungering eyes.
537,THALASSIUS,"For the moon wandered witless of her way,"
538,THALASSIUS,Spell-stricken by strong magic in such wise
539,THALASSIUS,As wizards use to set the stars astray.
540,THALASSIUS,And in his ears the music that makes mad
541,THALASSIUS,"Beat always; and what way the music bade,"
542,THALASSIUS,That alway rode he; nor was any sleep
543,THALASSIUS,"His, nor from height nor deep."
544,THALASSIUS,"But heaven was as red iron, slumberless,"
545,THALASSIUS,And had no heart to bless;
546,THALASSIUS,"And earth lay sere and darkling as distraught,"
547,THALASSIUS,And help in her was nought.
548,THALASSIUS,
549,THALASSIUS,"Then many a midnight, many a morn and even,"
550,THALASSIUS,"His mother, passing forth of her fair heaven,"
551,THALASSIUS,With goodlier gifts than all save gods can give
552,THALASSIUS,"From earth or from the heaven where sea-things live,"
553,THALASSIUS,With shine of sea-flowers through the bay-leaf braid
554,THALASSIUS,Woven for a crown her foam-white hands had made
555,THALASSIUS,"To crown him with land's laurel and sea-dew,"
556,THALASSIUS,Sought the sea-bird that was her boy: but he
557,THALASSIUS,"Sat panther-throned beside Erigone,"
558,THALASSIUS,Riding the red ways of the revel through
559,THALASSIUS,Midmost of pale-mouthed passion's crownless crew.
560,THALASSIUS,Till on some winter's dawn of some dim year
561,THALASSIUS,He let the vine-bit on the panther's lip
562,THALASSIUS,"Slide, and the green rein slip,"
563,THALASSIUS,"And set his eyes to seaward, nor gave ear"
564,THALASSIUS,"If sound from landward hailed him, dire or dear;"
565,THALASSIUS,And passing forth of all those fair fierce ranks
566,THALASSIUS,"Back to the grey sea-banks,"
567,THALASSIUS,"Against a sea-rock lying, aslant the steep,"
568,THALASSIUS,Fell after many sleepless dreams on sleep.
569,THALASSIUS,
570,THALASSIUS,And in his sleep the dun green light was shed
571,THALASSIUS,Heavily round his head
572,THALASSIUS,"That through the veil of sea falls fathom-deep,"
573,THALASSIUS,Blurred like a lamp's that when the night drops dead
574,THALASSIUS,Dies; and his eyes gat grace of sleep to see
575,THALASSIUS,"The deep divine dark dayshine of the sea,"
576,THALASSIUS,"Dense water-walls and clear dusk water-ways,"
577,THALASSIUS,"Broad-based, or branching as a sea-flower sprays"
578,THALASSIUS,That side or this dividing; and anew
579,THALASSIUS,The glory of all her glories that he knew.
580,THALASSIUS,And in sharp rapture of recovering tears
581,THALASSIUS,"He woke on fire with yearnings of old years,"
582,THALASSIUS,"Pure as one purged of pain that passion bore,"
583,THALASSIUS,Ill child of bitter mother; for his own
584,THALASSIUS,"Looked laughing toward him from her midsea throne,"
585,THALASSIUS,Up toward him there ashore.
586,THALASSIUS,
587,THALASSIUS,"Thence in his heart the great same joy began,"
588,THALASSIUS,Of child that made him man:
589,THALASSIUS,"And turned again from all hearts else on quest,"
590,THALASSIUS,"He communed with his own heart, and had rest."
591,THALASSIUS,And like sea-winds upon loud waters ran
592,THALASSIUS,"His days and dreams together, till the joy"
593,THALASSIUS,Burned in him of the boy.
594,THALASSIUS,Till the earth's great comfort and the sweet sea's breath
595,THALASSIUS,"Breathed and blew life in where was heartless death,"
596,THALASSIUS,"Death spirit-stricken of soul-sick days, where strife"
597,THALASSIUS,Of thought and flesh made mock of death and life.
598,THALASSIUS,And grace returned upon him of his birth
599,THALASSIUS,Where heaven was mixed with heavenlike sea and earth;
600,THALASSIUS,And song shot forth strong wings that took the sun
601,THALASSIUS,"From inward, fledged with might of sorrow and mirth"
602,THALASSIUS,And father's fire made mortal in his son.
603,THALASSIUS,Nor was not spirit of strength in blast and breeze
604,THALASSIUS,To exalt again the sun's child and the sea's;
605,THALASSIUS,For as wild mares in Thessaly grow great
606,THALASSIUS,"With child of ravishing winds, that violate"
607,THALASSIUS,Their leaping length of limb with manes like fire
608,THALASSIUS,And eyes outburning heaven's
609,THALASSIUS,With fires more violent than the lightning levin's
610,THALASSIUS,"And breath drained out and desperate of desire,"
611,THALASSIUS,"Even so the spirit in him, when winds grew strong,"
612,THALASSIUS,Grew great with child of song.
613,THALASSIUS,Nor less than when his veins first leapt for joy
614,THALASSIUS,"To draw delight in such as burns a boy,"
615,THALASSIUS,Now too the soul of all his senses felt
616,THALASSIUS,The passionate pride of deep sea-pulses dealt
617,THALASSIUS,Through nerve and jubilant vein
618,THALASSIUS,"As from the love and largess of old time,"
619,THALASSIUS,And with his heart again
620,THALASSIUS,The tidal throb of all the tides keep rhyme
621,THALASSIUS,And charm him from his own soul's separate sense
622,THALASSIUS,With infinite and invasive influence
623,THALASSIUS,"That made strength sweet in him and sweetness strong,"
624,THALASSIUS,"Being now no more a singer, but a song."
625,THALASSIUS,
626,THALASSIUS,Till one clear day when brighter sea-wind blew
627,THALASSIUS,"And louder sea-shine lightened, for the waves"
628,THALASSIUS,"Were full of godhead and the light that saves,"
629,THALASSIUS,"His father's, and their spirit had pierced him through,"
630,THALASSIUS,He felt strange breath and light all round him shed
631,THALASSIUS,That bowed him down with rapture; and he knew
632,THALASSIUS,"His father's hand, hallowing his humbled head,"
633,THALASSIUS,"And the old great voice of the old good time, that said:"
634,THALASSIUS,
635,THALASSIUS,"""Child of my sunlight and the sea, from birth"
636,THALASSIUS,A fosterling and fugitive on earth;
637,THALASSIUS,"Sleepless of soul as wind or wave or fire,"
638,THALASSIUS,A manchild with an ungrown God's desire;
639,THALASSIUS,"Because thou hast loved nought mortal more than me,"
640,THALASSIUS,"Thy father, and thy mother-hearted sea;"
641,THALASSIUS,"Because thou hast set thine heart to sing, and sold"
642,THALASSIUS,"Life and life's love for song, God's living gold;"
643,THALASSIUS,Because thou hast given thy flower and fire of youth
644,THALASSIUS,"To feed men's hearts with visions, truer than truth;"
645,THALASSIUS,Because thou hast kept in those world-wandering eyes
646,THALASSIUS,The light that makes me music of the skies;
647,THALASSIUS,Because thou hast heard with world-unwearied ears
648,THALASSIUS,The music that puts light into the spheres;
649,THALASSIUS,Have therefore in thine heart and in thy mouth
650,THALASSIUS,"The sound of song that mingles north and south,"
651,THALASSIUS,"The song of all the winds that sing of me,"
652,THALASSIUS,"And in thy soul the sense of all the sea."""

657,ON THE CLIFFS,ON THE CLIFFS
658,ON THE CLIFFS,
659,ON THE CLIFFS,[Greek: imerophônos aêdôn.]
660,ON THE CLIFFS,
661,SAPPHO.,SAPPHO.
662,SAPPHO.,
663,SAPPHO.,
664,SAPPHO.,Between the moondawn and the sundown here
665,SAPPHO.,The twilight hangs half starless; half the sea
666,SAPPHO.,Still quivers as for love or pain or fear
667,SAPPHO.,Or pleasure mightier than these all may be
668,SAPPHO.,A man's live heart might beat
669,SAPPHO.,Wherein a God's with mortal blood should meet
670,SAPPHO.,And fill its pulse too full to bear the strain
671,SAPPHO.,"With fear or love or pleasure's twin-born, pain."
672,SAPPHO.,Fiercely the gaunt woods to the grim soil cling
673,SAPPHO.,That bears for all fair fruits
674,SAPPHO.,Wan wild sparse flowers of windy and wintry spring
675,SAPPHO.,Between the tortive serpent-shapen roots
676,SAPPHO.,Wherethrough their dim growth hardly strikes and shoots
677,SAPPHO.,And shews one gracious thing
678,SAPPHO.,"Hardly, to speak for summer one sweet word"
679,SAPPHO.,Of summer's self scarce heard.
680,SAPPHO.,"But higher the steep green sterile fields, thick-set"
681,SAPPHO.,With flowerless hawthorn even to the upward verge
682,SAPPHO.,Whence the woods gathering watch new cliffs emerge
683,SAPPHO.,"Higher than their highest of crowns that sea-winds fret,"
684,SAPPHO.,"Hold fast, for all that night or wind can say,"
685,SAPPHO.,"Some pale pure colour yet,"
686,SAPPHO.,Too dim for green and luminous for grey.
687,SAPPHO.,Between the climbing inland cliffs above
688,SAPPHO.,"And these beneath that breast and break the bay,"
689,SAPPHO.,A barren peace too soft for hate or love
690,SAPPHO.,Broods on an hour too dim for night or day.
691,SAPPHO.,
692,SAPPHO.,"O wind, O wingless wind that walk'st the sea,"
693,SAPPHO.,"Weak wind, wing-broken, wearier wind than we,"
694,SAPPHO.,"Who are yet not spirit-broken, maimed like thee,"
695,SAPPHO.,Who wail not in our inward night as thou
696,SAPPHO.,"In the outer darkness now,"
697,SAPPHO.,What word has the old sea given thee for mine ear
698,SAPPHO.,From thy faint lips to hear?
699,SAPPHO.,"For some word would she send me, knowing not how."
700,SAPPHO.,
701,SAPPHO.,"Nay, what far other word"
702,SAPPHO.,"Than ever of her was spoken, or of me"
703,SAPPHO.,Or all my winged white kinsfolk of the sea
704,SAPPHO.,"Between fresh wave and wave was ever heard,"
705,SAPPHO.,Cleaves the clear dark enwinding tree with tree
706,SAPPHO.,Too close for stars to separate and to see
707,SAPPHO.,Enmeshed in multitudinous unity?
708,SAPPHO.,What voice of what strong God hath stormed and stirred
709,SAPPHO.,"The fortressed rock of silence, rent apart"
710,SAPPHO.,Even to the core Night's all-maternal heart?
711,SAPPHO.,"What voice of God grown heavenlier in a bird,"
712,SAPPHO.,Made keener of edge to smite
713,SAPPHO.,"Than lightning--yea, thou knowest, O mother Night,"
714,SAPPHO.,Keen as that cry from thy strange children sent
715,SAPPHO.,"Wherewith the Athenian judgment-shrine was rent,"
716,SAPPHO.,"For wrath that all their wrath was vainly spent,"
717,SAPPHO.,Their wrath for wrong made right
718,SAPPHO.,By justice in her own divine despite
719,SAPPHO.,That bade pass forth unblamed
720,SAPPHO.,The sinless matricide and unashamed?
721,SAPPHO.,"Yea, what new cry is this, what note more bright"
722,SAPPHO.,"Than their song's wing of words was dark of flight,"
723,SAPPHO.,"What word is this thou hast heard,"
724,SAPPHO.,"Thine and not thine or theirs, O Night, what word"
725,SAPPHO.,More keen than lightning and more sweet than light?
726,SAPPHO.,As all men's hearts grew godlike in one bird
727,SAPPHO.,"And all those hearts cried on thee, crying with might,"
728,SAPPHO.,"Hear us, O mother Night."
729,SAPPHO.,
730,SAPPHO.,Dumb is the mouth of darkness as of death:
731,SAPPHO.,"Light, sound and life are one"
732,SAPPHO.,In the eyes and lips of dawn that draw the sun
733,SAPPHO.,To hear what first child's word with glimmering breath
734,SAPPHO.,Their weak wan weanling child the twilight saith;
735,SAPPHO.,But night makes answer none.
736,SAPPHO.,
737,SAPPHO.,"God, if thou be God,--bird, if bird thou be,--"
738,SAPPHO.,Do thou then answer me.
739,SAPPHO.,"For but one word, what wind soever blow,"
740,SAPPHO.,Is blown up usward ever from the sea.
741,SAPPHO.,In fruitless years of youth dead long ago
742,SAPPHO.,And deep beneath their own dead leaves and snow
743,SAPPHO.,"Buried, I heard with bitter heart and sere"
744,SAPPHO.,"The same sea's word unchangeable, nor knew"
745,SAPPHO.,But that mine own life-days were changeless too
746,SAPPHO.,And sharp and salt with unshed tear on tear
747,SAPPHO.,"And cold and fierce and barren; and my soul,"
748,SAPPHO.,"Sickening, swam weakly with bated breath"
749,SAPPHO.,"In a deep sea like death,"
750,SAPPHO.,And felt the wind buffet her face with brine
751,SAPPHO.,"Hard, and harsh thought on thought in long bleak roll"
752,SAPPHO.,Blown by keen gusts of memory sad as thine
753,SAPPHO.,"Heap the weight up of pain, and break, and leave"
754,SAPPHO.,Strength scarce enough to grieve
755,SAPPHO.,"In the sick heavy spirit, unmanned with strife"
756,SAPPHO.,Of waves that beat at the tired lips of life.
757,SAPPHO.,
758,SAPPHO.,"Nay, sad may be man's memory, sad may be"
759,SAPPHO.,"The dream he weaves him as for shadow of thee,"
760,SAPPHO.,"But scarce one breathing-space, one heartbeat long,"
761,SAPPHO.,Wilt thou take shadow of sadness on thy song.
762,SAPPHO.,"Not thou, being more than man or man's desire,"
763,SAPPHO.,"Being bird and God in one,"
764,SAPPHO.,With throat of gold and spirit of the sun;
765,SAPPHO.,"The sun whom all our souls and songs call sire,"
766,SAPPHO.,"Whose godhead gave thee, chosen of all our quire,"
767,SAPPHO.,"Thee only of all that serve, of all that sing"
768,SAPPHO.,"Before our sire and king,"
769,SAPPHO.,"Borne up some space on time's world-wandering wing,"
770,SAPPHO.,"This gift, this doom, to bear till time's wing tire--"
771,SAPPHO.,Life everlasting of eternal fire.
772,SAPPHO.,
773,SAPPHO.,Thee only of all; yet can no memory say
774,SAPPHO.,How many a night and day
775,SAPPHO.,"My heart has been as thy heart, and my life"
776,SAPPHO.,"As thy life is, a sleepless hidden thing,"
777,SAPPHO.,"Full of the thirst and hunger of winter and spring,"
778,SAPPHO.,That seeks its food not in such love or strife
779,SAPPHO.,As fill men's hearts with passionate hours and rest.
780,SAPPHO.,From no loved lips and on no loving breast
781,SAPPHO.,Have I sought ever for such gifts as bring
782,SAPPHO.,"Comfort, to stay the secret soul with sleep."
783,SAPPHO.,"The joys, the loves, the labours, whence men reap"
784,SAPPHO.,"Rathe fruit of hopes and fears,"
785,SAPPHO.,I have made not mine; the best of all my days
786,SAPPHO.,"Have been as those fair fruitless summer strays,"
787,SAPPHO.,"Those water-waifs that but the sea-wind steers,"
788,SAPPHO.,Flakes of glad foam or flowers on footless ways
789,SAPPHO.,"That take the wind in season and the sun,"
790,SAPPHO.,And when the wind wills is their season done.
791,SAPPHO.,
792,SAPPHO.,For all my days as all thy days from birth
793,SAPPHO.,"My heart as thy heart was in me as thee,"
794,SAPPHO.,Fire; and not all the fountains of the sea
795,SAPPHO.,"Have waves enough to quench it, nor on earth"
796,SAPPHO.,"Is fuel enough to feed,"
797,SAPPHO.,While day sows night and night sows day for seed.
798,SAPPHO.,
799,SAPPHO.,"We were not marked for sorrow, thou nor I,"
800,SAPPHO.,"For joy nor sorrow, sister, were we made,"
801,SAPPHO.,"To take delight and grief to live and die,"
802,SAPPHO.,Assuaged by pleasures or by pains affrayed
803,SAPPHO.,That melt men's hearts and alter; we retain
804,SAPPHO.,"A memory mastering pleasure and all pain,"
805,SAPPHO.,"A spirit within the sense of ear and eye,"
806,SAPPHO.,"A soul behind the soul, that seeks and sings"
807,SAPPHO.,And makes our life move only with its wings
808,SAPPHO.,"And feed but from its lips, that in return"
809,SAPPHO.,Feed of our hearts wherein the old fires that burn
810,SAPPHO.,Have strength not to consume
811,SAPPHO.,Nor glory enough to exalt us past our doom.
812,SAPPHO.,
813,SAPPHO.,"_Ah, ah, the doom_ (thou knowest whence rang that wail)"
814,SAPPHO.,_Of the shrill nightingale!_
815,SAPPHO.,"(From whose wild lips, thou knowest, that wail was thrown)"
816,SAPPHO.,_For round about her have the great gods cast
817,SAPPHO.,"A wing-borne body, and clothed her close and fast"
818,SAPPHO.,With a sweet life that hath no part in moan.
819,SAPPHO.,"But me, for me_ (how hadst thou heart to hear?)"
820,SAPPHO.,_Remains a sundering with the two-edged spear._
821,SAPPHO.,
822,SAPPHO.,"_Ah, for her doom!_ so cried in presage then"
823,SAPPHO.,"The bodeful bondslave of the king of men,"
824,SAPPHO.,And might not win her will.
825,SAPPHO.,"Too close the entangling dragnet woven of crime,"
826,SAPPHO.,"The snare of ill new-born of elder ill,"
827,SAPPHO.,"The curse of new time for an elder time,"
828,SAPPHO.,"Had caught, and held her yet,"
829,SAPPHO.,"Enmeshed intolerably in the intolerant net,"
830,SAPPHO.,"Who thought with craft to mock the God most high,"
831,SAPPHO.,And win by wiles his crown of prophecy
832,SAPPHO.,"From the Sun's hand sublime,"
833,SAPPHO.,"As God were man, to spare or to forget."
834,SAPPHO.,
835,SAPPHO.,"But thou,--the gods have given thee and forgiven thee"
836,SAPPHO.,More than our master gave
837,SAPPHO.,That strange-eyed spirit-wounded strange-tongued slave
838,SAPPHO.,There questing houndlike where the roofs red-wet
839,SAPPHO.,Reeked as a wet red grave.
840,SAPPHO.,"Life everlasting has their strange grace given thee,"
841,SAPPHO.,Even hers whom thou wast wont to sing and serve
842,SAPPHO.,"With eyes, but not with song, too swift to swerve;"
843,SAPPHO.,"Yet might not even thine eyes estranged estrange her,"
844,SAPPHO.,"Who seeing thee too, but inly, burn and bleed"
845,SAPPHO.,"Like that pale princess-priest of Priam's seed,"
846,SAPPHO.,For stranger service gave thee guerdon stranger;
847,SAPPHO.,"If this indeed be guerdon, this indeed"
848,SAPPHO.,"Her mercy, this thy meed--"
849,SAPPHO.,"That thou, being more than all we born, being higher"
850,SAPPHO.,Than all heads crowned of him that only gives
851,SAPPHO.,"The light whereby man lives,"
852,SAPPHO.,The bay that bids man moved of God's desire
853,SAPPHO.,"Lay hand on lute or lyre,"
854,SAPPHO.,Set lip to trumpet or deflowered green reed--
855,SAPPHO.,"If this were given thee for a grace indeed,"
856,SAPPHO.,"That thou, being first of all these, thou alone"
857,SAPPHO.,"Shouldst have the grace to die not, but to live"
858,SAPPHO.,"And lose nor change one pulse of song, one tone"
859,SAPPHO.,"Of all that were thy lady's and thine own,"
860,SAPPHO.,"Thy lady's whom thou criedst on to forgive,"
861,SAPPHO.,"Thou, priest and sacrifice on the altar-stone"
862,SAPPHO.,"Where none may worship not of all that live,"
863,SAPPHO.,"Love's priestess, errant on dark ways diverse;"
864,SAPPHO.,"If this were grace indeed for Love to give,"
865,SAPPHO.,If this indeed were blessing and no curse.
866,SAPPHO.,
867,SAPPHO.,"Love's priestess, mad with pain and joy of song,"
868,SAPPHO.,"Song's priestess, mad with joy and pain of love,"
869,SAPPHO.,"Name above all names that are lights above,"
870,SAPPHO.,"We have loved, praised, pitied, crowned and done thee wrong,"
871,SAPPHO.,O thou past praise and pity; thou the sole
872,SAPPHO.,"Utterly deathless, perfect only and whole"
873,SAPPHO.,"Immortal, body and soul."
874,SAPPHO.,For over all whom time hath overpast
875,SAPPHO.,"The shadow of sleep inexorable is cast,"
876,SAPPHO.,The implacable sweet shadow of perfect sleep
877,SAPPHO.,That gives not back what life gives death to keep;
878,SAPPHO.,"Yea, all that lived and loved and sang and sinned"
879,SAPPHO.,Are all borne down death's cold sweet soundless wind
880,SAPPHO.,"That blows all night and knows not whom its breath,"
881,SAPPHO.,"Darkling, may touch to death:"
882,SAPPHO.,"But one that wind hath touched and changed not,--one"
883,SAPPHO.,Whose body and soul are parcel of the sun;
884,SAPPHO.,"One that earth's fire could burn not, nor the sea"
885,SAPPHO.,Quench; nor might human doom take hold on thee;
886,SAPPHO.,"All praise, all pity, all dreams have done thee wrong,"
887,SAPPHO.,"All love, with eyes love-blinded from above;"
888,SAPPHO.,"Song's priestess, mad with joy and pain of love,"
889,SAPPHO.,"Love's priestess, mad with pain and joy of song."
890,SAPPHO.,
891,SAPPHO.,Hast thou none other answer then for me
892,SAPPHO.,"Than the air may have of thee,"
893,SAPPHO.,Or the earth's warm woodlands girdling with green girth
894,SAPPHO.,"Thy secret sleepless burning life on earth,"
895,SAPPHO.,"Or even the sea that once, being woman crowned"
896,SAPPHO.,"And girt with fire and glory of anguish round,"
897,SAPPHO.,"Thou wert so fain to seek to, fain to crave"
898,SAPPHO.,If she would hear thee and save
899,SAPPHO.,And give thee comfort of thy great green grave?
900,SAPPHO.,"Because I have known thee always who thou art,"
901,SAPPHO.,"Thou knowest, have known thee to thy heart's own heart,"
902,SAPPHO.,Nor ever have given light ear to storied song
903,SAPPHO.,"That did thy sweet name sweet unwitting wrong,"
904,SAPPHO.,"Nor ever have called thee nor would call for shame,"
905,SAPPHO.,"Thou knowest, but inly by thine only name,"
906,SAPPHO.,"Sappho--because I have known thee and loved, hast thou"
907,SAPPHO.,None other answer now?
908,SAPPHO.,"As brother and sister were we, child and bird,"
909,SAPPHO.,Since thy first Lesbian word
910,SAPPHO.,"Flamed on me, and I knew not whence I knew"
911,SAPPHO.,"This was the song that struck my whole soul through,"
912,SAPPHO.,"Pierced my keen spirit of sense with edge more keen,"
913,SAPPHO.,"Even when I knew not,--even ere sooth was seen,--"
914,SAPPHO.,When thou wast but the tawny sweet winged thing
915,SAPPHO.,Whose cry was but of spring.
916,SAPPHO.,
917,SAPPHO.,"And yet even so thine ear should hear me--yea,"
918,SAPPHO.,"Hear me this nightfall by this northland bay,"
919,SAPPHO.,"Even for their sake whose loud good word I had,"
920,SAPPHO.,Singing of thee in the all-beloved clime
921,SAPPHO.,"Once, where the windy wine of spring makes mad"
922,SAPPHO.,"Our sisters of Majano, who kept time"
923,SAPPHO.,Clear to my choral rhyme.
924,SAPPHO.,Yet was the song acclaimed of these aloud
925,SAPPHO.,"Whose praise had made mute humbleness misproud,"
926,SAPPHO.,"The song with answering song applauded thus,"
927,SAPPHO.,But of that Daulian dream of Itylus.
928,SAPPHO.,"So but for love's love haply was it--nay,"
929,SAPPHO.,"How else?--that even their song took my song's part,"
930,SAPPHO.,"For love of love and sweetness of sweet heart,"
931,SAPPHO.,Or god-given glorious madness of mid May
932,SAPPHO.,"And heat of heart and hunger and thirst to sing,"
933,SAPPHO.,Full of the new wine of the wind of spring.
934,SAPPHO.,
935,SAPPHO.,"Or if this were not, and it be not sin"
936,SAPPHO.,"To hold myself in spirit of thy sweet kin,"
937,SAPPHO.,In heart and spirit of song;
938,SAPPHO.,"If this my great love do thy grace no wrong,"
939,SAPPHO.,Thy grace that gave me grace to dwell therein;
940,SAPPHO.,"If thy gods thus be my gods, and their will"
941,SAPPHO.,Made my song part of thy song--even such part
942,SAPPHO.,As man's hath of God's heart--
943,SAPPHO.,And my life like as thy life to fulfil;
944,SAPPHO.,"What have our gods then given us? Ah, to thee,"
945,SAPPHO.,"Sister, much more, much happier than to me,"
946,SAPPHO.,"Much happier things they have given, and more of grace"
947,SAPPHO.,Than falls to man's light race;
948,SAPPHO.,"For lighter are we, all our love and pain"
949,SAPPHO.,"Lighter than thine, who knowest of time or place"
950,SAPPHO.,"Thus much, that place nor time"
951,SAPPHO.,Can heal or hurt or lull or change again
952,SAPPHO.,The singing soul that makes his soul sublime
953,SAPPHO.,Who hears the far fall of its fire-fledged rhyme
954,SAPPHO.,Fill darkness as with bright and burning rain
955,SAPPHO.,"Till all the live gloom inly glows, and light"
956,SAPPHO.,Seems with the sound to cleave the core of night.
957,SAPPHO.,
958,SAPPHO.,"The singing soul that moves thee, and that moved"
959,SAPPHO.,"When thou wast woman, and their songs divine"
960,SAPPHO.,Who mixed for Grecian mouths heaven's lyric wine
961,SAPPHO.,"Fell dumb, fell down reproved"
962,SAPPHO.,Before one sovereign Lesbian song of thine.
963,SAPPHO.,"That soul, though love and life had fain held fast,"
964,SAPPHO.,"Wind-winged with fiery music, rose and past"
965,SAPPHO.,"Through the indrawn hollow of earth and heaven and hell,"
966,SAPPHO.,As through some strait sea-shell
967,SAPPHO.,"The wide sea's immemorial song,--the sea"
968,SAPPHO.,That sings and breathes in strange men's ears of thee
969,SAPPHO.,"How in her barren bride-bed, void and vast,"
970,SAPPHO.,Even thy soul sang itself to sleep at last.
971,SAPPHO.,
972,SAPPHO.,"To sleep? Ah, then, what song is this, that here"
973,SAPPHO.,"Makes all the night one ear,"
974,SAPPHO.,"One ear fulfilled and mad with music, one"
975,SAPPHO.,"Heart kindling as the heart of heaven, to hear"
976,SAPPHO.,A song more fiery than the awakening sun
977,SAPPHO.,"Sings, when his song sets fire"
978,SAPPHO.,To the air and clouds that build the dead night's pyre?
979,SAPPHO.,"_O thou of divers-coloured mind, O thou"
980,SAPPHO.,"Deathless, God's daughter subtle-souled_--lo, now,"
981,SAPPHO.,"Now too the song above all songs, in flight"
982,SAPPHO.,"Higher than the day-star's height,"
983,SAPPHO.,And sweet as sound the moving wings of night!
984,SAPPHO.,"_Thou of the divers-coloured seat_--behold,"
985,SAPPHO.,Her very song of old!--
986,SAPPHO.,"_O deathless, O God's daughter subtle-souled!_"
987,SAPPHO.,That same cry through this boskage overhead
988,SAPPHO.,"Rings round reiterated,"
989,SAPPHO.,"Palpitates as the last palpitated,"
990,SAPPHO.,The last that panted through her lips and died
991,SAPPHO.,Not down this grey north sea's half sapped cliff-side
992,SAPPHO.,"That crumbles toward the coastline, year by year"
993,SAPPHO.,More near the sands and near;
994,SAPPHO.,"The last loud lyric fiery cry she cried,"
995,SAPPHO.,"Heard once on heights Leucadian,--heard not here."
996,SAPPHO.,
997,SAPPHO.,"Not here; for this that fires our northland night,"
998,SAPPHO.,This is the song that made
999,SAPPHO.,"Love fearful, even the heart of love afraid,"
1000,SAPPHO.,With the great anguish of its great delight.
1001,SAPPHO.,"No swan-song, no far-fluttering half-drawn breath,"
1002,SAPPHO.,"No word that love of love's sweet nature saith,"
1003,SAPPHO.,"No dirge that lulls the narrowing lids of death,"
1004,SAPPHO.,"No healing hymn of peace-prevented strife,--"
1005,SAPPHO.,This is her song of life.
1006,SAPPHO.,
1007,SAPPHO.,"_I loved thee_,--hark, one tenderer note than all--"
1008,SAPPHO.,"_Atthis, of old time, once_--one low long fall,"
1009,SAPPHO.,"Sighing--one long low lovely loveless call,"
1010,SAPPHO.,Dying--one pause in song so flamelike fast--
1011,SAPPHO.,"_Atthis, long since in old time overpast_--"
1012,SAPPHO.,One soft first pause and last.
1013,SAPPHO.,"One,--then the old rage of rapture's fieriest rain"
1014,SAPPHO.,Storms all the music-maddened night again.
1015,SAPPHO.,
1016,SAPPHO.,"_Child of God, close craftswoman, I beseech thee,"
1017,SAPPHO.,"Bid not ache nor agony break nor master,"
1018,SAPPHO.,"Lady, my spirit_--"
1019,SAPPHO.,"O thou her mistress, might her cry not reach thee?"
1020,SAPPHO.,"Our Lady of all men's loves, could Love go past her,"
1021,SAPPHO.,"Pass, and not hear it?"
1022,SAPPHO.,
1023,SAPPHO.,"She hears not as she heard not; hears not me,"
1024,SAPPHO.,"O treble-natured mystery,--how should she"
1025,SAPPHO.,"Hear, or give ear?--who heard and heard not thee;"
1026,SAPPHO.,"Heard, and went past, and heard not; but all time"
1027,SAPPHO.,Hears all that all the ravin of his years
1028,SAPPHO.,Hath cast not wholly out of all men's ears
1029,SAPPHO.,And dulled to death with deep dense funeral chime
1030,SAPPHO.,Of their reiterate rhyme.
1031,SAPPHO.,"And now of all songs uttering all her praise,"
1032,SAPPHO.,"All hers who had thy praise and did thee wrong,"
1033,SAPPHO.,"Abides one song yet of her lyric days,"
1034,SAPPHO.,"Thine only, this thy song."
1035,SAPPHO.,
1036,SAPPHO.,"O soul triune, woman and god and bird,"
1037,SAPPHO.,"Man, man at least has heard."
1038,SAPPHO.,"All ages call thee conqueror, and thy cry"
1039,SAPPHO.,The mightiest as the least beneath the sky
1040,SAPPHO.,"Whose heart was ever set to song, or stirred"
1041,SAPPHO.,With wind of mounting music blown more high
1042,SAPPHO.,"Than wildest wing may fly,"
1043,SAPPHO.,"Hath heard or hears,--even Æschylus as I."
1044,SAPPHO.,"But when thy name was woman, and thy word"
1045,SAPPHO.,"Human,--then haply, surely then meseems"
1046,SAPPHO.,"This thy bird's note was heard on earth of none,"
1047,SAPPHO.,Of none save only in dreams.
1048,SAPPHO.,In all the world then surely was but one
1049,SAPPHO.,Song; as in heaven at highest one sceptred sun
1050,SAPPHO.,"Regent, on earth here surely without fail"
1051,SAPPHO.,"One only, one imperious nightingale."
1052,SAPPHO.,"Dumb was the field, the woodland mute, the lawn"
1053,SAPPHO.,Silent; the hill was tongueless as the vale
1054,SAPPHO.,Even when the last fair waif of cloud that felt
1055,SAPPHO.,"Its heart beneath the colouring moonrays melt,"
1056,SAPPHO.,"At high midnoon of midnight half withdrawn,"
1057,SAPPHO.,Bared all the sudden deep divine moondawn.
1058,SAPPHO.,"Then, unsaluted by her twin-born tune,"
1059,SAPPHO.,That latter timeless morning of the moon
1060,SAPPHO.,Rose past its hour of moonrise; clouds gave way
1061,SAPPHO.,"To the old reconquering ray,"
1062,SAPPHO.,But no song answering made it more than day;
1063,SAPPHO.,No cry of song by night
1064,SAPPHO.,Shot fire into the cloud-constraining light.
1065,SAPPHO.,"One only, one Æolian island heard"
1066,SAPPHO.,"Thrill, but through no bird's throat,"
1067,SAPPHO.,"In one strange manlike maiden's godlike note,"
1068,SAPPHO.,The song of all these as a single bird.
1069,SAPPHO.,Till the sea's portal was as funeral gate
1070,SAPPHO.,For that sole singer in all time's ageless date
1071,SAPPHO.,"Singled and signed for so triumphal fate,"
1072,SAPPHO.,All nightingales but one in all the world
1073,SAPPHO.,"All her sweet life were silent; only then,"
1074,SAPPHO.,"When her life's wing of womanhood was furled,"
1075,SAPPHO.,"Their cry, this cry of thine was heard again,"
1076,SAPPHO.,"As of me now, of any born of men."
1077,SAPPHO.,"Through sleepless clear spring nights filled full of thee,"
1078,SAPPHO.,"Rekindled here, thy ruling song has thrilled"
1079,SAPPHO.,The deep dark air and subtle tender sea
1080,SAPPHO.,And breathless hearts with one bright sound fulfilled.
1081,SAPPHO.,Or at midnoon to me
1082,SAPPHO.,"Swimming, and birds about my happier head"
1083,SAPPHO.,"Skimming, one smooth soft way by water and air,"
1084,SAPPHO.,To these my bright born brethren and to me
1085,SAPPHO.,Hath not the clear wind borne or seemed to bear
1086,SAPPHO.,A song wherein all earth and heaven and sea
1087,SAPPHO.,Were molten in one music made of thee
1088,SAPPHO.,"To enforce us, O our sister of the shore,"
1089,SAPPHO.,Look once in heart back landward and adore?
1090,SAPPHO.,"For songless were we sea-mews, yet had we"
1091,SAPPHO.,"More joy than all things joyful of thee--more,"
1092,SAPPHO.,"Haply, than all things happiest; nay, save thee,"
1093,SAPPHO.,In thy strong rapture of imperious joy
1094,SAPPHO.,"Too high for heart of sea-borne bird or boy,"
1095,SAPPHO.,What living things were happiest if not we?
1096,SAPPHO.,"But knowing not love nor change nor wrath nor wrong,"
1097,SAPPHO.,No more we knew of song.
1098,SAPPHO.,
1099,SAPPHO.,"Song, and the secrets of it, and their might,"
1100,SAPPHO.,"What blessings curse it and what curses bless,"
1101,SAPPHO.,"I know them since my spirit had first in sight,"
1102,SAPPHO.,"Clear as thy song's words or the live sun's light,"
1103,SAPPHO.,The small dark body's Lesbian loveliness
1104,SAPPHO.,That held the fire eternal; eye and ear
1105,SAPPHO.,"Were as a god's to see, a god's to hear,"
1106,SAPPHO.,"Through all his hours of daily and nightly chime,"
1107,SAPPHO.,The sundering of the two-edged spear of time:
1108,SAPPHO.,The spear that pierces even the sevenfold shields
1109,SAPPHO.,"Of mightiest Memory, mother of all songs made,"
1110,SAPPHO.,And wastes all songs as roseleaves kissed and frayed
1111,SAPPHO.,As here the harvest of the foam-flowered fields;
1112,SAPPHO.,But thine the spear may waste not that he wields
1113,SAPPHO.,"Since first the God whose soul is man's live breath,"
1114,SAPPHO.,"The sun whose face hath our sun's face for shade,"
1115,SAPPHO.,Put all the light of life and love and death
1116,SAPPHO.,"Too strong for life, but not for love too strong,"
1117,SAPPHO.,"Where pain makes peace with pleasure in thy song,"
1118,SAPPHO.,"And in thine heart, where love and song make strife,"
1119,SAPPHO.,Fire everlasting of eternal life.

1171,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,That one birth more divine
1172,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Than all births else of thine
1173,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,That hang like flowers or jewels on thy deep soft breast
1174,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Was left for me to shine
1175,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Above thy girdling line
1176,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Of bright and breathing brine,"
1177,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,To take mine eyes with rapture and my sense with rest.
1178,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,
1179,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"That this was left for me,                              [_Ant._2."
1180,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Mother, to have of thee,"
1181,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"To touch, to taste, to see,"
1182,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"To feel as fire fulfilling all my blood and breath,"
1183,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,As wine of living fire
1184,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Keen as the heart's desire
1185,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,That makes the heart its pyre
1186,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,And on its burning visions burns itself to death.
1187,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,
1188,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"For here of all thy waters, here of all"
1189,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Thy windy ways the wildest, and beset"
1190,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,As some beleaguered city's war-breached wall
1191,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"With deaths enmeshed all round it in deep net,"
1192,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Thick sown with rocks deadlier than steel, and fierce"
1193,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"With loud cross-countering currents, where the ship"
1194,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Flags, flickering like a wind-bewildered leaf,"
1195,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,The densest weft of waves that prow may pierce
1196,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Coils round the sharpest warp of shoals that dip
1197,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Suddenly, scarce well under for one brief"
1198,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Keen breathing-space between the streams adverse,"
1199,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Scarce showing the fanged edge of one hungering lip
1200,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Or one tooth lipless of the ravening reef;
1201,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,And midmost of the murderous water's web
1202,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"All round it stretched and spun,"
1203,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Laughs, reckless of rough tide and raging ebb,"
1204,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,The loveliest thing that shines against the sun.

1206,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"O flower of all wind-flowers and sea-flowers,               [_Str._ 3."
1207,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Made lovelier by love of the sea
1208,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Than thy golden own field-flowers, or tree-flowers"
1209,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Like foam of the sea-facing tree!
1210,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,No foot but the seamew's there settles
1211,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"On the spikes of thine anthers like horns,"
1212,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"With snow-coloured spray for thy petals,"
1213,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Black rocks for thy thorns.

1219,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Chose forth of all farthest far islands
1220,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"As a haven to harbour her head,"
1221,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Of all lowlands on earth and all highlands,"
1222,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,His bride-worthy bed?

1225,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Made fast as with anchors to land,"
1226,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"And broke, that his waves might be round thee,"
1227,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Thy fetters like rivets of sand?
1228,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,And afar by the blast of him drifted
1229,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Thy blossom of beauty was borne,"
1230,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,As a lark by the heart in her lifted
1231,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,To mix with the morn?
1232,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,
1233,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"By what rapture of rage, by what vision                     [_Ant._ 4."
1234,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Of a heavenlier heaven than above,"
1235,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Was he moved to devise thy division
1236,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,From the land as a rest for his love?
1237,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,As a nest when his wings would remeasure
1238,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"The ways where of old they would be,"
1239,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,As a bride-bed upbuilt for his pleasure
1240,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,By sea-rock and sea?
1241,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,
1242,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,For in no deeps of midmost inland May
1243,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"More flowerbright flowers the hawthorn, or more sweet"
1244,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Swells the wild gold of the earth for wandering feet;
1245,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,For on no northland way
1246,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Crowds the close whin-bloom closer, set like thee"
1247,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,With thorns about for fangs of sea-rock shown
1248,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Through blithe lips of the bitter brine to lee;
1249,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Nor blithelier landward comes the sea-wind blown,"
1250,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Nor blithelier leaps the land-wind back to sea:
1251,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Nor louder springs the living song of birds
1252,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,To shame our sweetest words.
1253,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,And in the narrowest of thine hollowest hold
1254,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"For joy thine aspens quiver as though for cold,"
1255,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,And many a self-lit flower-illumined tree
1256,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Outlaughs with snowbright or with rosebright glee
1257,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,The laughter of the fields whose laugh is gold.
1258,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Yea, even from depth to height,"
1259,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Even thine own beauty with its own delight
1260,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Fulfils thine heart in thee an hundredfold
1261,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Beyond the larger hearts of islands bright
1262,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,With less intense contraction of desire
1263,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Self-satiate, centred in its own deep fire;"
1264,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Of shores not self-enchanted and entranced
1265,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,By heavenly severance from all shadow of mirth
1266,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Or mourning upon earth:
1267,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"As thou, by no similitude enhanced,"
1268,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"By no fair foil made fairer, but alone"
1269,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Fair as could be no beauty save thine own,"
1270,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,And wondrous as no world-beholden wonder:
1271,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Throned, with the world's most perilous sea for throne,"
1272,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,And praised from all its choral throats of thunder.

1276,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"To exalt thee, wert thou lowlier"
1277,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Than all that take the sea
1278,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,With shores whence waves ebb slowlier

1296,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,For fate and fear too strong;
1297,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Earth's friend, whose eyes look past her,"
1298,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Whose hands would purge of wrong;
1299,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Our lord, our light, our master,"
1300,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Whose word sums up all song.
1301,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,

1306,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"But rapturously remember,"
1307,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"All heavenlike as thou art,"

1310,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Whose passage more divine,"
1311,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Whose hand, our thunder-bearer,"
1312,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Held fire that bade thee shine
1313,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,With subtler glory and rarer
1314,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Than thrills the sun's own shrine.
1315,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,
1316,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Who knows how then his godlike banished gaze
1317,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Turned haply from its goal of natural days
1318,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"And homeward hunger for the clear French clime,"
1319,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Toward English earth, whereunder now the Accursed"
1320,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Rots, in the hate of all men's hearts inhearsed,"
1321,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,A carrion ranker to the sense of time
1322,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,For that sepulchral gift of stone and lime
1323,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"By royal grace laid on it, less of weight"
1324,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Than the load laid by fate,"
1325,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Fate, misbegotten child of his own crime,"
1326,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Son of as foul a bastard-bearing birth
1327,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,As even his own on earth;

1329,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,By loyal grace of all souls undefiled
1330,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"On one man's head, whose reeking soul made rotten"
1331,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,The loathed live corpse on earth once misbegotten?

1334,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"And slavery chosen, more vile by choice of chance"
1335,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Than dull damnation of inheritance

1354,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Beheld, the mightier for those heavier hours"
1355,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,That bowed his heart not down
1356,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Nor marred one crowning blossom of his crown?
1357,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"For surely, might we say,"

1359,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Through channelled darkness for the darkling day
1360,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Hardly to let men's faltering footfall win

1365,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"With violence of wild waters, and with thunder"
1366,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Of many winds as one,"
1367,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,To where the keen sea-current grinds and frets
1368,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,The black bright sheer twin flameless Altarlets
1369,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,That lack no live blood-sacrifice they crave
1370,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Of shipwreck and the shrine-subservient wave,"
1371,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Having for priest the storm-wind, and for choir"
1372,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Lightnings and clouds whose prayer and praise are fire,"
1373,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"All the isle acclaimed him coming; she, the least"
1374,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Of all things loveliest that the sea's love hides
1375,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"From strange men's insult, walled about with tides"
1376,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"That bid strange guests back from her flower-strewn feast,"
1377,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Set all her fields aflower, her flowers aflame,"
1378,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,To applaud him that he came.
1379,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Nor surely flashed not something of delight
1380,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Through that steep strait of rock whose twin-cliffed height
1381,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Links crag with crag reiterate, land with land,"
1382,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,By one sheer thread of narrowing precipice
1383,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Bifront, that binds and sunders"
1384,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Abyss from hollower imminent abyss
1385,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"And wilder isle with island, blind for bliss"
1386,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,Of sea that lightens and of wind that thunders;

1392,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Knew not the song her sister, even as she"
1393,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Thundering, or like her confluent spring-tides brightening,"
1394,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,And like her darkness lightening;

1405,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"As the lyre in his own for a birthright of old that was given of his sire,"
1406,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,And the hand of the child was put forth on the chords yet alive and aflame
1407,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,From the hand of the God that had wrought it in heaven; and the hand was
1408,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,the same.
1409,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"And the tongue of the child spake, singing; and never a note that he sang,"
1410,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"But the strings made answer unstricken, as though for the God they rang."

1415,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"So trembled the heart of the hills and the rocks to receive him, and"
1416,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,yearned
1417,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,With desirous delight of his presence and love that beholding him burned.
1418,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Yea, down through the mighty twin hollows where never the sunlight shall"

1420,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Deep sunk under imminent earth, and subdued to the stress of the sea,"
1421,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"That feel when the dim week changes by change of their tides in the dark,"

1423,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Even there in the terror of twilight in bloom with its blossoms ablush,"

1426,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Though the sun they behold not for ever, yet knew they not over them One"
1427,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Whose soul was the soul of the morning, whose song was the song of the sun?"
1428,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"But the secrets inviolate of sunlight in hollows untrodden of day,"
1429,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Shall he dream what are these who beholds not? or he that hath seen,"
1430,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,shall he say?
1431,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,For the path is for passage of sea-mews; and he that hath glided and leapt
1432,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"Over sea-grass and sea-rock, alighting as one from a citadel crept"
1433,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"That his foemen beleaguer, descending by darkness and stealth, at the last"

1440,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"From the crown of the culminant arch to the floor of the lakelet abloom,"
1441,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,One infinite blossom of blossoms innumerable aflush through the gloom.
1442,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,All under the deeps of the darkness are glimmering; all over impends
1443,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,"An immeasurable infinite flower of the dark that dilates and descends,"
1444,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,That exults and expands in its breathless and blind efflorescence of heart

1456,THE GARDEN OF CYMODOCE,For the beam from beneath and without it refrangent again from the wave
