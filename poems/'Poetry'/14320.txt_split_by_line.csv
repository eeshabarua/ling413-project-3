54,I.,What dreams the flower cups enfold
55,I.,"Within their fragrant leaves,"
56,I.,"Of meadow-ways grown fair with spring,"
57,I.,Soft mists that April weaves;
58,I.,And cottage gardens where the scent
59,I.,Of flowers is with the wood-smoke blent.
60,I.,
61,I.,"The ceaseless ripple of the brook,"
62,I.,"Babbling against the broken arch,"
63,I.,"The little firwood's tasselled spires,"
64,I.,The cloud of verdure on the larch;
65,I.,"The gold-green glimmer of the woods,"
66,I.,Where tender twilight always broods.

95,THE ROSE IN OCTOBER.,
96,THE ROSE IN OCTOBER.,"O late and sweet, too sweet, too late!"
97,THE ROSE IN OCTOBER.,What nightingale will sing to thee?
98,THE ROSE IN OCTOBER.,"The empty nest, the shivering tree,"
99,THE ROSE IN OCTOBER.,"The dead leaves by the garden gate,"
100,THE ROSE IN OCTOBER.,"And cawing crows for thee will wait,"
101,THE ROSE IN OCTOBER.,O sweet and late!
102,THE ROSE IN OCTOBER.,
103,THE ROSE IN OCTOBER.,Where wert thou when the soft June nights
104,THE ROSE IN OCTOBER.,"Were faint with perfume, glad with song?"
105,THE ROSE IN OCTOBER.,Where wert thou when the days were long
106,THE ROSE IN OCTOBER.,And steeped in Summer's young delights?
107,THE ROSE IN OCTOBER.,"What hopest thou now but checks and slights,"
108,THE ROSE IN OCTOBER.,"Brief days, lone nights?"
109,THE ROSE IN OCTOBER.,
110,THE ROSE IN OCTOBER.,"Stay, there's a gleam of Winter wheat"
111,THE ROSE IN OCTOBER.,Far on the hill; down in the woods
112,THE ROSE IN OCTOBER.,A very heaven of stillness broods;
113,THE ROSE IN OCTOBER.,"And through the mellow sun's worn heat,"
114,THE ROSE IN OCTOBER.,"Lo! tender pulses round thee beat,"
115,THE ROSE IN OCTOBER.,O late and sweet!

122,IV.,"There's beauty all around our paths, if but our watchful eyes"
123,IV.,Can trace it midst familiar things and through their lowly guise;
124,IV.,"We may find it when a hedgerow showers its blossoms o'er our way,"
125,IV.,Or a cottage window sparkles forth in the last red light of day.

138,V.,"Half covered with last year's leaves,"
139,V.,She peeped from her russet bed;
140,V.,
141,V.,The great bare branches of the trees
142,V.,Were tossed and swayed overhead;
143,V.,
144,V.,"The hedge looked barren and prickly,"
145,V.,Without the sign of a leaf;
146,V.,Over the flower there bowed a heart
147,V.,Grown cold with the snows of grief.
148,V.,
149,V.,The violet's fragile petals
150,V.,"Enfolded a heart of gold,"
151,V.,"And a deeper wealth of perfume,"
152,V.,Than the tiny cup could hold;
153,V.,So the great wind roaring above
154,V.,"Sent a tiny zephyr down,"
155,V.,"To drift aside the sheltering bloom,"
156,V.,And bereave her of her crown.
157,V.,
158,V.,"It stole the familiar scent,"
159,V.,To give to the burdened heart
160,V.,With only a cold north wind
161,V.,In the world to take its part;
162,V.,"The flower died in the bleak March air,"
163,V.,And the heart went on its way;
164,V.,"The violet's life was blooming there,"
165,V.,And melting the snows away.

182,VI.,
183,VI.,Here her long crests of fring√®d crag
184,VI.,Allure the skyward swallows;
185,VI.,Here the still dove's low love-note floats
186,VI.,Above her leafy hollows.
187,VI.,
188,VI.,"Here its calm strength her hillside rears,"
189,VI.,From heaving slopes of clover;
190,VI.,Here still the pewit pipes and flits

192,VI.,
193,VI.,"Here hums the wild-bee in the thyme,"

210,AN APPEAL.,
211,AN APPEAL.,"Dear, do not die!"
212,AN APPEAL.,Of cypresses and grassy graves sing I--
213,AN APPEAL.,"I hang with wreaths of song death's grief-grown cross,"
214,AN APPEAL.,"And weep, to music, for Life's infinite loss,"
215,AN APPEAL.,"And make the sweetest verse of bitterest woe,"
216,AN APPEAL.,--I know the way because I love you so;
217,AN APPEAL.,But I have written griefs that I have known
218,AN APPEAL.,"In other's heart's blood, never in my own."
219,AN APPEAL.,If _you_ died what more could be sung or said?
220,AN APPEAL.,I could not sing of Death if you were dead.
221,AN APPEAL.,
222,AN APPEAL.,"Dear, do not love!"
223,AN APPEAL.,"Do not love _me_, keep still aloof, above!"
224,AN APPEAL.,While you and Love in far-off glory stand
225,AN APPEAL.,"Clear sounds the voice, and harp responds to hand."
226,AN APPEAL.,But if you loved me--if you came quite near
227,AN APPEAL.,And set Love 'mid life's common things and dear--
228,AN APPEAL.,"Mute would the voice be, Love would be too fair"
229,AN APPEAL.,"To waste upon the wide world's empty air,"
230,AN APPEAL.,"And, songless, I should droop and vainly pine--"
231,AN APPEAL.,I could not sing of Love if you were mine!

262,IX.,"And weary labourers have homeward gone,"
263,IX.,Their day's work done.
264,IX.,
265,IX.,"The cornfield now is still,"
266,IX.,To-morrow will
267,IX.,Bring back the men who reap:
268,IX.,But now asleep

285,X.,
286,X.,"As clasps some lake, by gusts unriven,"
287,X.,"The blue dome's measureless content,"
288,X.,So my soul held that moment's heaven;--
289,X.,I only know she came and went.
290,X.,
291,X.,"As at one bound, our swift Spring heaps"
292,X.,"The orchard full of bloom and scent,"

346,XII.,"Now comes the first chill whisper of the end,"
347,XII.,While yet the woods are green and skies are blue;
348,XII.,"While under loads of corn great waggons bend,"
349,XII.,And sunshine makes us glad the whole day through.
350,XII.,"The trees are full of leaf and of delight,"
351,XII.,Yet through them sighs the forecast of the time
352,XII.,"When the lean branches shall be wondrous, white"
353,XII.,With winter's lovely radiant frost and rime.
354,XII.,
355,XII.,"The fallen leaves as yet are hardly missed,"
356,XII.,"The rest will fade--until the woods are bare,"
357,XII.,"And the dim glades where summer lovers kissed,"
358,XII.,Forget how leafy and divine they were.
359,XII.,"And in our souls come whispers of despair,"
360,XII.,"""Failure again--failure for evermore!"
361,XII.,"Leaves only for one summer's space are fair,"
362,XII.,"No flower can live to see the fruit it bore."""
363,XII.,
364,XII.,"Yet every spring millions of flowers have birth,"
365,XII.,And every autumn brings its fruits and sheaves;
366,XII.,"But when the fruit and grain make glad the earth,"
367,XII.,"Dead are the flowers, and falling are the leaves."
368,XII.,"Though all our lives we see our dear dreams die,--"
369,XII.,Each noble dream brings fruit. It may not be
370,XII.,"The fruit we hoped it would be followed by,"
371,XII.,But the fruit lasts to all eternity.
372,XII.,
373,XII.,No seed is lost--in earth's brown bosom cast;
374,XII.,No deed is lost--of all the deeds we do;
375,XII.,"Each grows to fruit--is harvested at last,"
376,XII.,"Haply in shape undreamed of, fair, and new."
377,XII.,"And, though we die before the end be won,"
378,XII.,"Our deeds live on; and other men will cry,"
379,XII.,"Seeing the end of what we have begun,"
380,XII.,"""Still lives the fruit for which the flowers had to die!"""

395,XIII.,"""We come from the shores of the green old Nile,"
396,XIII.,"From the land where the roses of Sharon smile,"
397,XIII.,And each worn wing hath regained its home
398,XIII.,"Under peasants' roof-trees or monarch's dome."""
399,XIII.,
400,XIII.,"And what have ye found in the monarch's dome,"
401,XIII.,Since last ye traversed the blue sea's foam?
402,XIII.,"""We have found a change, we have found a pall,"
403,XIII.,"And a gloom o'ershadowing the banquet's hall,"
404,XIII.,"And a mark on the floor as of life-drops spilt,--"
405,XIII.,"Naught looks the same, save the nest we built."""

408,XIII.,
409,XIII.,O joyous birds! it hath still been so;
410,XIII.,Through the halls of kings doth the tempest go!
411,XIII.,"But the huts of the hamlet lie still and deep,"
412,XIII.,And the hills o'er their quiet a vigil keep:
413,XIII.,"Say, what have ye found in the peasant's cot,"
414,XIII.,Since last ye parted from that sweet spot?--
415,XIII.,
416,XIII.,"""A change we have found there--and many a change!"
417,XIII.,"Faces and footsteps, and all things strange!"
418,XIII.,"Gone are the heads of the silvery hair,"
419,XIII.,"And the young that were, have a brow of care."
420,XIII.,And the place is hushed where the children played--
421,XIII.,"Naught looks the same, save the nest we made."""
