715,THE CRY OF EVE,"Lay dreaming Eve by her outdriven mate,"
716,THE CRY OF EVE,Pillowed on lilies that still told the sweet
717,THE CRY OF EVE,Of birth within the Garden's ecstasy.
718,THE CRY OF EVE,Pitiful round her face that could not lose
719,THE CRY OF EVE,Its memory of God's perfecting was strewn

744,THE CRY OF EVE,And Babylon upbuilded on our sin;
745,THE CRY OF EVE,"And Nineveh, a city sinking slow"
746,THE CRY OF EVE,Under a shroud of sandy centuries
747,THE CRY OF EVE,That hid me not from the buried cursing eyes
748,THE CRY OF EVE,Of women who e'er-bitterly gave birth!
749,THE CRY OF EVE,"Ah, to be mother of all misery!"
750,THE CRY OF EVE,To be first-called out of the earth and fail
751,THE CRY OF EVE,For a whole world! To shame maternity
752,THE CRY OF EVE,For women evermore--women whose tears
753,THE CRY OF EVE,"Flooding the night, no hope can wipe away!"
754,THE CRY OF EVE,"To see the wings of Death, as, Adam, thou"
755,THE CRY OF EVE,"Hast not, endlessly beating, and to hear"
756,THE CRY OF EVE,The swooning ages suffer up to God!
757,THE CRY OF EVE,"And Oh, that birth-cry of a guiltless child"
758,THE CRY OF EVE,"In it are sounding of our sin and woe,"
759,THE CRY OF EVE,With prophesy of ill beyond all years!
760,THE CRY OF EVE,Yearning for beauty never to be seen--
761,THE CRY OF EVE,Beatitude redeemless evermore!
762,THE CRY OF EVE,
763,THE CRY OF EVE,"""And I whose dream mourned with all motherhood"
764,THE CRY OF EVE,"Must hear it soon! Already do soft skill,"
765,THE CRY OF EVE,"Assuasive lulls, enticings and quick tones"
766,THE CRY OF EVE,Of tenderness--that will like light awake
767,THE CRY OF EVE,The folded memory children shall bring
768,THE CRY OF EVE,Out of the dark--move in me longingly.
769,THE CRY OF EVE,"Yet thou, Adam, dear fallen thought of God,"
770,THE CRY OF EVE,"Thou, when thou too shall hear humanity"
771,THE CRY OF EVE,"Cry in thy child, wilt groaning wish the world"
772,THE CRY OF EVE,"Back in unsummoned Void! and, woe! wilt fill"

779,THE CRY OF EVE,Folded again dark wings above their rest.

1095,THE WINDS,The West Wind is an Indian brave
1096,THE WINDS,Who scours the Autumn's crest.
1097,THE WINDS,"Dashing the forest down as a slave,"
1098,THE WINDS,He tears the leaves from its limbs and weaves
1099,THE WINDS,A maelstrom for his breast.

1101,THE WINDS,Crying to fright
1102,THE WINDS,The earth he swoops to spoil--

1105,THE WINDS,There is misery and moil.

1110,THE WINDS,Ice Sea that froze ere Ymir rose
1111,THE WINDS,From Niflheim's ebon breath.
1112,THE WINDS,And with him sail
1113,THE WINDS,"Snow, Frost, and Hail,"
1114,THE WINDS,"Thanes mighty as their lord,"
1115,THE WINDS,To plunder the shores of Summer's stores--
1116,THE WINDS,And his roar's
1117,THE WINDS,Like the sound of Chaos' horde.
1118,THE WINDS,
1119,THE WINDS,The South Wind is a Troubadour;
1120,THE WINDS,The Spring 's his serenade.
1121,THE WINDS,"Over the mountain, over the moor,"
1122,THE WINDS,He blows to bloom from the winter's tomb
1123,THE WINDS,Blossom and leaf and blade.
1124,THE WINDS,He ripples the throat
1125,THE WINDS,Of the lark with a note
1126,THE WINDS,"Of lilting love and bliss,"
1127,THE WINDS,"And the sun and the moon, the night and the noon,"
1128,THE WINDS,Are a-swoon--

2795,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE
2796,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,
2797,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,
2798,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,Tho' thou hast ne'er unpent thy pain's delight
2799,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,"Upon these airs, bird of the poet's love,"
2800,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,Yet must I sing thy singing! For the Night
2801,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,Has poured her jewels o'er the lap of heaven
2802,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,As they who hear thee say thou dost above
2803,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,The wood such ecstasies as were not given
2804,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,By nestling breasts of Venus to the dove.

2807,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,2
2808,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,
2809,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,Oft have I watched the moon with her fair gold
2810,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,Still clung to by the tattered mists of day
2811,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,Arise and look for thee. Then hope grew bold.
2812,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,And almost I could see how the near laurels
2813,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,Would tremble with thy trembling: but the sway
2814,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,Of bards who wreathed thee with unfading chorals
2815,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,Has held my longing lips from this poor lay.
2816,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,
2817,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,
2818,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,3
2819,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,
2820,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,But take it now. And if the lark--who is
2821,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,Too high for earth--may vie for praise with thee
2822,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,"In aery rhapsody, yet it is his"
2823,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,"To sing of day and joy, while thou of sorrow"
2824,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,And night o'erhovering singest. So thou'lt be
2825,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,More dear than he--till hearts shall cease to borrow
2826,AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE,From grief the healing for life's mystery.

2837,WILDNESS,"To soar, as the sea-mew pleases!"

2851,BEFORE AUTUMN,Waned
2852,BEFORE AUTUMN,As amber fires
2853,BEFORE AUTUMN,Of an Aztec shrine.
2854,BEFORE AUTUMN,The invisible breath of coming death has stained
2855,BEFORE AUTUMN,The withering leaves with its nepenthean wine--
2856,BEFORE AUTUMN,Autumn's near.
2857,BEFORE AUTUMN,
2858,BEFORE AUTUMN,Winds in the woodland moan--
2859,BEFORE AUTUMN,Moan
2860,BEFORE AUTUMN,As memories
2861,BEFORE AUTUMN,Of a chilling yore.
2862,BEFORE AUTUMN,Magnolia seeds like Indian beads are strown
2863,BEFORE AUTUMN,From crimson pods along the earth's sere floor--
2864,BEFORE AUTUMN,Autumn's near.
2865,BEFORE AUTUMN,
2866,BEFORE AUTUMN,"Solitude slowly steals,"
2867,BEFORE AUTUMN,Steals
2868,BEFORE AUTUMN,Her silent way
2869,BEFORE AUTUMN,By the songless brook.
2870,BEFORE AUTUMN,"At the gnarly yoke of a solemn oak she kneels,"
2871,BEFORE AUTUMN,The musing joy of sadness in her look--
2872,BEFORE AUTUMN,Autumn's near.
2873,BEFORE AUTUMN,
2874,BEFORE AUTUMN,"Yes, with her golden days--"
2875,BEFORE AUTUMN,Days
2876,BEFORE AUTUMN,When hope and toil
2877,BEFORE AUTUMN,Are at peace and rest--
2878,BEFORE AUTUMN,"Autumn is near, and the tired year 'mid praise"
2879,BEFORE AUTUMN,Lies down with leaf and blossom on his breast--
2880,BEFORE AUTUMN,Autumn's near.

2896,FULFILMENT,Life's flow is weak.
2897,FULFILMENT,
2898,FULFILMENT,Along the weedy roads and lanes I walk--or pause--
2899,FULFILMENT,Ponder a fallen nut or quirking crow whose caws
2900,FULFILMENT,Seem with prehuman hintings fraught or ancient awes
2901,FULFILMENT,Of forest deeps.

2903,FULFILMENT,"Of forest deeps the pale-face hunter never trod,"
2904,FULFILMENT,"Nor Indian, with the silent stealth of Nature shod;"

2906,FULFILMENT,Who never sleeps.

2908,FULFILMENT,"And many times has Autumn, on her harvest way,"
2909,FULFILMENT,"Gathered again into the earth leaf, fruit, and spray;"
2910,FULFILMENT,"Here many times dwelt rueful as she dwells to-day,"
2911,FULFILMENT,The while she reaps.
