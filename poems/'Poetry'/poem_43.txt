I


_He._ Aglai-a! Aglai-a!
      Sweet, awaken and be glad.
_She._ Who is this that calls Aglaia?
      Is it thou, my dearest lad?
_He._ 'Tis Arion, 'tis Arion,
      Who calls thee from sleep--
    From slumber who bids thee
    To follow and number
      His kids and his sheep.
_She._ Nay, leave to entreat me!
      If mother should spy on
    Us twain, she would beat me.
_He._ Then come, my love, come!
     And hide with Arion
       Where green woods are dumb!

_She._ Ar-i-on! Ar-i-on!
         Closer, list! I am afraid!

_He._ Whisper, then, thy love Arion,
         From thy window, lily maid.

_She._ Yet Aglaia, yet Aglaia
         Hath heard them debate
       Of wooing repenting--
       "Who trust to undoing,
        Lament them too late."

_He._ Nay, nay, when I woo thee,
         Thy mother might spy on
       All harm I shall do thee.

_She._ I come, then--I come!
       To follow Arion
         Where green woods be dumb.
