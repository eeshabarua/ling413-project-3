49,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,The ancestry of William Cullen Bryant might have been inferred from the
50,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"character of his writings, which reflect whatever is best and noblest in"
51,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,the life and thought of New England. It was a tradition that the first
52,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,Bryant of whom there is any account in the annals of the New World came
53,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"over in the Mayflower, but the tradition is not authenticated. What is"
54,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"known of this gentleman, Mr. Stephen Bryant, is that he came over from"
55,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"England, and that he was at Plymouth, Massachusetts, as early as 1632."
56,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"He married Abigail Shaw, who had emigrated with her father, and who bore"
57,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"him several children between 1650 and 1665, it is to be presumed at"
58,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Plymouth, of which town he was chosen constable in 1663. Stephen Bryant"
59,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"had a son named Ichabod, who was the father of Philip Bryant, who was"
60,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"born in 1732. Philip Bryant married Silence Howard, the daughter of Dr."
61,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Abiel Howard, of West Bridgewater, whose profession he adopted, being a"
62,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,practitioner in medicine in North Bridgewater. He was the father of nine
63,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"children, one of whom, Peter Bryant, born in 1767, succeeded him in his"
64,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"profession. Young Dr. Bryant became enamored of Miss Sarah Snell, the"
65,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"daughter of Mr. Ebenezer Snell, of Bridgewater, who removed his family"
66,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"to Cummington, whither he was followed by his future son-in-law, who"
67,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"married the lady of his love in 1792. Two years later, on the 3d of"
68,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"November, there was born to him a man-child, who was to win, and to"
69,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"leave,"
70,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
71,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"""One of the few immortal names"
72,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"That were not born to die."""
73,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
74,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Dr. Bryant was proud of his profession; and in the hope, no doubt, that"
75,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"his son would become a shining light therein, he perpetuated at his"
76,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"christening the name of a great medical authority, who had departed this"
77,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,life four years before--William Cullen. Dr. Bryant was the last of his
78,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"family to practise the healing art; for Nature, wiser than he, early"
79,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,determined the future course of Master William Cullen Bryant. He was not
80,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"to be a doctor, but a poet. A poet, that is, if he lived to be anything;"
81,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,for the chances were against his living at all. The lad was exceedingly
82,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"frail, and had a head the immensity of which troubled his anxious"
83,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,father. How to reduce it to the normal size was a puzzle which Dr.
84,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Bryant solved in a spring of clear, cold water, which burst out of the"
85,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"ground on or near his homestead, and into which the child was immersed"
86,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"every morning, head and all, by two of Dr. Bryant's students--kicking"
87,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"lustily, we may be sure, at this matutinal dose of hydropathy."
88,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
89,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"William Cullen Bryant came of Mayflower stock, his mother being a"
90,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,descendant of John Alden; and the characteristics of his family
91,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,included some of the sterner qualities of the Puritans. Grandfather
92,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Snell was a magistrate, and, without doubt a severe one, for the period"
93,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,was not one which favored leniency to criminals. The whipping-post was
94,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"still extant in Massachusetts, and the poet remembered that it stood"
95,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"about a mile from his early home at Cummington, and that he once saw a"
96,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,young fellow of eighteen who had received forty lashes as a punishment
97,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"for a theft he had committed. It was, he thought, the last example of"
98,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"corporal punishment inflicted by law in that neighborhood, though the"
99,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"whipping-post remained in its place for several years, a possible terror"
100,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"to future evildoers. ""Spare the rod, spoil the child,"" was the Draconian"
101,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"code then; and the rod, in the shape of a little bundle of birchen"
102,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"twigs, bound together with a small cord, was generally suspended on a"
103,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"nail against the wall in the kitchen, and was as much a part of the"
104,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,necessary furniture as the crane that hung in the fireplace or the
105,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,shovel and tongs.
106,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
107,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,Magistrate Snell was a disciplinarian of the stricter sort; and as he
108,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"and his wife resided with Dr. Bryant and his family, the latter stood in"
109,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"awe of him, so much so that young William Cullen was prevented from"
110,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"feeling anything like affection for him. It was an age of repression,"
111,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"not to say oppression, for children, who had few rights that their"
112,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,elders were bound to respect. To the terrors of the secular arm were
113,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"added the deeper terrors of the spiritual law, for the people of that"
114,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,primitive period were nothing if not religious. The minister was the
115,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"great man, and his bodily presence was a restraint upon the unruly, and"
116,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"the ruly too, for that matter. The lines of our ancestors did not fall"
117,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,in pleasant places as far as recreations were concerned; for they were
118,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"few and far between, consisting, for the most part, of militia musters,"
119,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"""raisings,"" corn-huskings, and singing-schools, diversified with the"
120,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,making of maple sugar and cider. Education was confined to the three
121,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"R's, though the children of wealthy parents were sent to colleges as"
122,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"they now are. It was not a genial social condition, it must be"
123,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"confessed, to which William Cullen Bryant was born, though it might have"
124,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"been worse but for his good father, who was in many respects superior to"
125,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"his rustic neighbors. A broad-shouldered, muscular gentleman, proud of"
126,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"his strength, his manners were gentle and reserved, his disposition was"
127,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"serene, and he was fond of society. He was not without political"
128,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"distinction, for he was elected to the Massachusetts House of"
129,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Representatives for several terms, and afterward to the State Senate,"
130,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,and he associated with the cultivated circles of Boston both as a
131,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,legislator and a physician.
132,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
133,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"William Cullen Bryant was fortunate in his father, who, if he was"
134,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,disappointed when he found that his son was born to be a follower of
135,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Apollo and not of Æsculapius, kept his disappointment to himself, and"
136,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,encouraged the lad in his poetical attempts. We have the authority of
137,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"the poet himself that his father taught his youth the art of verse, and"
138,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,that he offered him to the Muses in the bud of life. His first efforts
139,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"were several clever ""Enigmas,"" in imitation of the Latin writers, a"
140,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"translation from Horace, and a copy of verses which were written in his"
141,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"twelfth year, to be recited at the close of the winter school, ""in the"
142,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"presence of the Master, the Minister of the parish, and a number of"
143,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"private gentlemen."" They were printed on the 18th of March, 1807, in the"
144,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"_Hampshire Gazette_, from which these particulars are derived, and which"
145,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"was favored with other contributions from the pen of ""C. B."""
146,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
147,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,The juvenile poems of William Cullen Bryant are as clever as those of
148,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Chatterton, Pope, and Cowley; but they are in no sense original, and it"
149,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,would have been strange if they had been. There was no original writing
150,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"in America at the time they were written; and if there had been, it"
151,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,would hardly have commended itself to the old-fashioned taste of Dr.
152,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Bryant, to whom Pope was still a power in poetry, as Addison, no doubt,"
153,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"was in prose. It was natural, therefore, that he should offer his boy to"
154,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,the strait-laced Muses of Queen Anne's time; that the precocious boy
155,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"should lisp in heroic couplets, and that he should endeavor to be"
156,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,satirical. Politics were running high in the first decade of the present
157,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"century, and the favorite bug-bear in New England was President"
158,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Jefferson, who in 1807 had laid an embargo on American shipping, in"
159,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"consequence of the decrees of Napoleon, and the British orders in"
160,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"council in relation thereto. This act was denounced, and by no one more"
161,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"warmly than by Master Bryant, who made it the subject of a satire, which"
162,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"was published in Boston in 1808. It was entitled ""The Embargo; or,"
163,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Sketches of the Times,"" and was printed for the purchasers, who were"
164,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,found in sufficient numbers to exhaust the first edition. It is said to
165,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"have been well received, but doubts were expressed as to whether the"
166,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,author was really a youth of thirteen. His friends came to his rescue in
167,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"an ""Advertisement,"" which was prefixed to a second edition of his"
168,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"little _brochure_, published in the following year, and certified to his"
169,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,age from their personal knowledge of himself and his family. They also
170,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"certified to his extraordinary talents, though they should prefer to"
171,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"have him judged by his works, without favor or affection. They concluded"
172,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,by stating that the printer was authorized to disclose their names and
173,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,places of residence.
174,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
175,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"The early poetical exercises of William Cullen Bryant, like those of all"
176,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"young poets, were colored by the books which he read. Among these were"
177,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"the works of Pope, as I have already intimated, and, no doubt, the works"
178,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"of Cowper and Thomson. The latter, if they were in the library of Dr."
179,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Bryant, do not appear to have impressed his son at this time; nor,"
180,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"indeed, does any English poet except Pope, so far as we can judge from"
181,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"his contributions to the _Hampshire Gazette_, which were continued from"
182,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"time to time. They were bookish and patriotic; one, which was written at"
183,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Cummington on the 8th of January, 1810, being ""The Genius of Columbia;"""
184,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"and another, ""An Ode for the Fourth of July, 1812,"" to the tune of ""Ye"
185,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Gentlemen of England."" These productions are undeniably clever, but they"
186,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"are not characteristic of their writer, nor of the nature which"
187,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"surrounded his birthplace, with which he was familiar, and of which he"
188,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"was a close observer, as his poetry was soon to disclose."
189,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
190,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"He entered Williams College, in Williamstown, Mass., in his sixteenth"
191,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"year, and remained there until 1812, distinguishing himself for aptness"
192,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,and industry in classical learning and polite literature. At the end of
193,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"two years he withdrew, and commenced the study of law, first with Judge"
194,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Howe, of Worthington, and afterward with Mr. William Baylies, of"
195,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,Bridgewater. So far he had written nothing but clever amateur verse; but
196,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"now, in his eighteenth year, he wrote an imperishable poem. The"
197,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"circumstances under which it was composed have been variously stated,"
198,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"but they agree in the main particulars, and are thus given in ""The"
199,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Bryant Homestead Book"" (1870), apparently on authentic information: ""It"
200,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"was here at Cummington, while wandering in the primeval forests, over"
201,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"the floor of which were scattered the gigantic trunks of fallen trees,"
202,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"mouldering for long years, and suggesting an indefinitely remote"
203,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"antiquity, and where silent rivulets crept along through the carpet of"
204,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"dead leaves, the spoil of thousands of summers, that the poem entitled"
205,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,'Thanatopsis' was composed. The young poet had read the poems of Kirke
206,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"White, which, edited by Southey, were published about that time, and a"
207,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,small volume of Southey's miscellaneous poems; and some lines of those
208,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"authors had kindled his imagination, which, going forth over the face of"
209,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"the inhabitants of the globe, sought to bring under one broad and"
210,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"comprehensive view the destinies of the human race in the present life,"
211,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,and the perpetual rising and passing away of generation after generation
212,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"who are nourished by the fruits of its soil, and find a resting-place in"
213,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"its bosom."" We should like to know what lines in Southey and Kirke White"
214,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"suggested ""Thanatopsis,"" that they might be printed in letters of gold"
215,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,hereafter.
216,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
217,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"When the young poet quitted Cummington to begin his law studies, he left"
218,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,the manuscript of this incomparable poem among his papers in the house
219,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"of his father, who found it after his departure. ""Here are some lines"
220,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"that our William has been writing,"" he said to a lady to whom he showed"
221,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"them. She read them, and, raising her eyes to the face of Dr. Bryant,"
222,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,burst into tears--a tribute to the genius of his son in which he was not
223,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,ashamed to join. Blackstone bade his Muse a long adieu before he turned
224,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,to wrangling courts and stubborn law; and our young lawyer intended to
225,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"do the same (for poetry was starvation in America seventy years ago),"
226,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,but habit and nature were too strong for him. There is no difficulty in
227,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"tracing the succession of his poems, and in a few instances the places"
228,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"where they were written, or with which they concerned themselves."
229,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"""Thanatopsis,"" for example, was followed by ""The Yellow Violet,"" which"
230,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"was followed by the ""Inscription for the Entrance to a Wood,"" and the"
231,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"song beginning ""Soon as the glazed and gleaming snow."" The exquisite"
232,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"lines ""To a Waterfowl"" were written at Bridgewater, in his twentieth"
233,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"year, where he was still pursuing the study of law, which appears to"
234,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,have been distasteful to him. The concluding stanza sank deeply into a
235,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,heart that needed its pious lesson:
236,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
237,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"""He who, from zone to zone,"
238,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight,"
239,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"_In the long way that I must tread alone,_"
240,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"_Will lead my steps aright._"""
241,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
242,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"The lawyer-poet had a long way before him, but he did not tread it"
243,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"alone; for, after being admitted to the bar in Plymouth, and practising"
244,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"for a time in Plainfield, near Cummington, he removed to Great"
245,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Barrington, in Berkshire, where he saw the dwelling of the Genevieve of"
246,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"his chilly little ""Song,"" his Genevieve being Miss Frances Fairchild of"
247,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"that beautiful town, whom he married in his twenty-seventh year, and who"
248,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"was the light of his household for nearly half a century. It was to her,"
249,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"the reader may like to know, that he addressed the ideal poem beginning"
250,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"""O fairest of the rural maids"" (_circa_ 1825), ""The Future Life"" (1837),"
251,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"and ""The Life that Is"" (1858); and her memory and her loss are tenderly"
252,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"embalmed in one of the most touching of his later poems, ""October,"
253,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"1866."""
254,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
255,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"""Thanatopsis"" was sent to the _North American Review_ (whether by its"
256,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"author or his father we are not told), and with such a modest, not to"
257,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"say enigmatical, note of introduction, that its authorship was left in"
258,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"doubt. The _Review_ was managed by a club of young literary gentlemen,"
259,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"who styled themselves ""The North American Club,"" two of whose members,"
260,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Mr. Richard Henry Dana and Mr. Edward Tyrrel Channing, were considered"
261,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"its editors. Mr. Dana read the poem carefully, and was so surprised at"
262,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,its excellence that he doubted whether it was the production of an
263,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"American, an opinion in which his associates are understood to have"
264,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"concurred. While they were hesitating about its acceptance, he was told"
265,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"that the writer was a member of the Massachusetts Senate; and, the"
266,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Senate being then in session, he started immediately from Cambridge for"
267,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Boston. He reached the State House, and inquired for Senator Bryant. A"
268,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"tall, middle-aged man, with a business-like look, was pointed out to"
269,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"him. He was satisfied that he could not be the poet he sought, so he"
270,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"posted back to Cambridge without an introduction. The story ends here,"
271,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"and rather tamely; for the original narrator forgot, or perhaps never"
272,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"knew, that Dr. Bryant was a member of the Senate, and that it was among"
273,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,the possibilities that _he_ was the Senator with a similar name.
274,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,American poetry may be said to have commenced in 1817 with the September
275,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"number of the _North American Review_, which contained ""Thanatopsis"" and"
276,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"the ""Inscription for the Entrance of a Wood,"" the last being printed as"
277,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"a ""Fragment."" Six months later, in March, 1818, the impression which"
278,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"""Thanatopsis"" created was strengthened by the appearance of the lines"
279,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"""To a Waterfowl,"" and the ""Version of a Fragment of Simonides."""
280,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
281,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Mr. Bryant's literary life may now be said to have begun, though he"
282,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,depended upon the practice of his profession for his daily bread. He
283,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,continued his contributions to the _North American Review_ in the shape
284,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"of prose papers on literary topics, and maintained the most friendly"
285,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"relations with its conductors; notably so with Mr. Dana, who was seven"
286,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"years his elder, and who possessed, like himself, the accomplishment of"
287,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"verse. At the suggestion of this poetical and critical brother, he was"
288,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,invited to deliver a poem before the Phi Beta Kappa Society at Harvard
289,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,College--an honor which is offered only to those who have already made a
290,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"reputation, and are likely to reflect credit on the Society as well as"
291,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"on themselves. He accepted, and in 1821 wrote his first poem of any"
292,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"length, ""The Ages,"" which still remains the best poem of the kind that"
293,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,was ever recited before a college society either in this country or in
294,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"England; grave, stately, thoughtful, presenting in animated,"
295,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,picturesque stanzas a compact summary of the history of mankind. A young
296,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,Englishman of twenty-one--Thomas Babington Macaulay--delivered in the
297,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"same year a poem on ""Evening,"" before the students of Trinity College,"
298,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,Cambridge; and it is instructive to compare his conventional heroics
299,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,with the spirited Spenserian stanzas of William Cullen Bryant.

301,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"The lines ""To a Waterfowl,"" which were written at Bridgewater in 1815,"
302,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"were followed by ""Green River,"" ""A Winter Piece,"" ""The West Wind,"" ""The"
303,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Burial-Place,"" ""Blessed are they that mourn,"" ""No man knoweth his"
304,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Sepulchre,"" ""A Walk at Sunset,"" and ""The Hymn to Death."""
305,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
306,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"These poems, which cover a period of six busy years, are interesting to"
307,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"the poetic student as examples of the different styles of their writer,"
308,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"and of the changing elements of his thoughts and feelings. ""Green"
309,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"River,"" for example, is a momentary revealment of his shy temperament"
310,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"and his daily pursuits. Its glimpses of nature are charming, and his"
311,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,wish to be beside its waters is the most natural one in the world. The
312,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"young lawyer is not complimentary to his clients, whom he styles ""the"
313,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"dregs of men,"" while his pen, which does its best to serve them, becomes"
314,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"""a barbarous pen."" He is dejected, but a visit to the river will restore"
315,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"his spirits; for, as he gazes upon its lonely and lovely stream,"
316,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
317,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"""An image of that calm life appears"
318,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"That won my heart in my greener years."""
319,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
320,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"""A Winter Piece"" is a gallery of woodland pictures which anything of the"
321,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"kind in the language. ""A Walk at Sunset"" is notable in that it is the"
322,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"first poem in which we see (faintly, it must be confessed) the"
323,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"aboriginal element, which was soon to become a prominent one in Mr."
324,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,Bryant's poetry. It was inseparable from the primeval forests of the New
325,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"World, but he was the first to perceive its poetic value. The ""Hymn to"
326,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Death""--stately, majestic, consolatory--concludes with a touching"
327,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"tribute to the worth of his good father, who died while he was writing"
328,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"it, at the age of fifty-four. The year 1821 was an important one to Mr."
329,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Bryant, for it witnessed the publication of his first collection of"
330,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"verse, his marriage, and the death of his father."
331,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
332,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,The next four years of Mr. Bryant's life were more productive than any
333,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"that had preceded them, for he wrote upward of thirty poems during that"
334,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"time. The aboriginal element was creative in ""The Indian Girl's Lament,"""
335,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"""An Indian Story,"" ""An Indian at the Burial-Place of his Fathers,"" and,"
336,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"noblest of all, ""Monument Mountain;"" the Hellenic element predominated"
337,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"in ""The Massacre at Scio"" and ""The Song of the Greek Amazon;"" the"
338,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Hebraic element touched him lightly in ""Rizpah"" and the ""Song of the"
339,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Stars;"" and the pure poetic element was manifest in ""March,"" ""The"
340,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Rivulet"" (which, by the way, ran through the grounds of the old"
341,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"homestead at Cummington), ""After a Tempest,"" ""The Murdered Traveler,"""
342,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"""Hymn to the North Star,"" ""A Forest Hymn,"" ""O fairest of the rural"
343,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"maids,"" and the exquisite and now most pathetic poem, ""June."" These"
344,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"poems and others not specified here, if read continuously and in the"
345,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"order in which they were composed, show a wide range of sympathies, a"
346,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"perfect acquaintance with many measures, and a clear, capacious,"
347,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,ever-growing intellect. They are all distinctive of the genius of their
348,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"author, but neither exhibits the full measure of his powers. We can say"
349,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"of none of them, ""The man who wrote this will never write any better."""
350,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
351,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,The publication of Mr. Bryant's little volume of verse was indirectly
352,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,the cause of his adopting literature as a profession. It was warmly
353,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"commended, and by no one more so than by Mr. Gulian C. Verplanck, in the"
354,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,columns of the _New York American_. He was something of a literary
355,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"authority at the time, a man of fortune and college-bred, known in a"
356,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,mild way as the author of an anniversary discourse delivered before the
357,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"New York Historical Society in 1818, of a political satire entitled ""The"
358,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Bucktail Bards,"" and later of an ""Essay on the Doctrine of Contracts."""
359,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Among his friends was Mr. Henry D. Sedgwick, a summer neighbor, so to"
360,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"speak, of Mr. Bryant's, having a country-house at Stockbridge, a few"
361,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"miles from Great Barrington, and a house in town, which was frequented"
362,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"by the _literati_ of the day, such as Verplanck, Halleck, Percival,"
363,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Cooper, and others of less note. An admirer of Mr. Bryant, Mr. Sedgwick"
364,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"set to work, with the assistance of Mr. Verplanck, to procure him"
365,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"literary employment in New York, in order to enable him to escape his"
366,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,hated bondage to the law; and he was appointed assistant editor of a
367,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,projected periodical called the _New York Review and Athenæum Magazine_.
368,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"The at last enfranchised lawyer dropped his barbarous pen, closed his"
369,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"law-books, and in the winter or spring of 1825 removed with his"
370,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"household to New York. The projected periodical was started, as these"
371,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"sanguine ventures always are, with fair hopes of success. It was well"
372,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"edited, and its contributors were men of acknowledged ability. The June"
373,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,number contained two poems which ought to have made a great hit. One was
374,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"""A Song of Pitcairn's Island;"" the other was ""Marco Bozzaris."" There was"
375,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"no flourish of trumpets over them, as there would be now; the writers"
376,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"merely prefixed their initials, ""B."" and ""H."" The reading public of New"
377,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"York were not ready for the _Review_, which had been projected for their"
378,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"mental enlightenment; so, after about a year's struggle, it was merged"
379,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"in the _New York Literary Gazette_, which began its mission about four"
380,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,years before. This magazine shared the fate of its companion in a few
381,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"months, when it was consolidated with the _United States Literary"
382,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Gazette_, which in two months was swallowed up in the _United States"
383,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,Review_. The honor of publishing and finishing the last was shared by
384,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Boston and New York. Profit in these publications there was none, though"
385,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Bryant, Halleck, Willis, Dana, Bancroft, and Longfellow wrote for them."
386,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Too good, or not good enough, they lived and died prematurely. Mr."
387,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,Bryant's success as a metropolitan man of letters was not brilliant so
388,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,far; but there were other walks than those of pure literature open to
389,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"him, as to others, and into one of the most bustling of these he entered"
390,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"in his thirty-second year. In other words, he became one of the editors"
391,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,of the _Evening Post_. Henceforth he was to live by journalism.
392,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
393,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Journalism, though an exacting pursuit, leaves its skillful followers a"
394,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,little leisure in which to cultivate literature. It the heyday of those
395,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"ephemeral trifles, Annuals, and Mr. Bryant found time to edit one, with"
396,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"the assistance of his friend Mr. Verplanck, and his acquaintance Mr."
397,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Robert C. Sands (who, by the way, was one of the editors of the"
398,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"_Commercial Advertiser_), and a very creditable work it was. His"
399,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"contributions to ""The Talisman"" included some of his best poems. Poetry"
400,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,was the natural expression of his genius--a fact which he could never
401,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"understand, for it always seemed to him that prose was the natural"
402,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"expression of all mankind. His prose was, and always continued to be,"
403,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"masterly. Its earliest examples, outside of his critical papers in the"
404,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,_North American Review_ and other periodicals (and outside of the
405,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"_Evening Post_, of course), are two stories entitled ""Medfield"" and ""The"
406,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Skeleton's Cave,"" contributed by him to ""Tales of the Glauber Spa"""
407,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"(1832)--a collection of original stories by Mr. James K. Paulding, Mr."
408,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Verplanck, Mr. Sands, Mr. William Leggett, and Miss Catharine Sedgwick."
409,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,Three years before (1828) he had become the chief editor of the _Evening
410,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Post_. Associated with him was Mr. Leggett, who had shown some talent as"
411,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"a writer of sketches and stories, and who had failed, like himself, in"
412,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"conducting a critical publication, for which his countrymen were not"
413,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"ready. He made a second collection of his poems at this time (1832), a"
414,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"copy of which was sent by Mr. Verplanck to Mr. Washington Irving, who"
415,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"was then, what he had been for years, the idol of English readers, and"
416,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,not without weight with the Trade. Would he see if some English house
417,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"would not reprint it? No leading publisher nibbled at it, not even"
418,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Murray, who was Mr. Irving's publisher; but an obscure bookseller named"
419,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Andrews finally agreed to undertake it, if Mr. Irving would put his"
420,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,valuable name on the title-page as the editor. He was not acquainted
421,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"with Mr. Bryant, but he was a kind-hearted, large-souled gentleman, who"
422,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"knew good poetry when he saw it, and he consented to ""edit"" the book. He"
423,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"was not a success in the estimation of Andrews, who came to him one day,"
424,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"by no means a merry Andrew, and declared that the book would ruin him"
425,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,unless one or more changes were made in the text. What was amiss in it?
426,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"He turned to the ""Song of Marion's Men,"" and stumbled over an obnoxious"
427,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,couplet in the first stanza:
428,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
429,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"""The British soldier trembles"
430,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"When Marion's name is told."""
431,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
432,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"""That won't do at all, you know."" The absurdity of the objection must"
433,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,have struck the humorist comically; but as he wanted the volume
434,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"republished, he good-naturedly saved the proverbial valor of the British"
435,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,soldier by changing the first line to
436,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
437,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"""The foeman trembles in his camp,"""
438,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
439,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"and the tempest in a teapot was over, as far as England was concerned."
440,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Not as far as the United States was concerned, however; for when the"
441,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"circumstance became known to Mr. Leggett, he excoriated Mr. Irving for"
442,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"his subserviency to a bloated aristocracy, and so forth. Mr. John Wilson"
443,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"reviewed the book in _Blackwood's Magazine_ in a half-hearted way,"
444,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,patronizing the writer with his praise.
445,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
446,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,The poems that Mr. Bryant wrote during the first seven years of his
447,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"residence in New York (some forty in number, not including translations)"
448,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,exhibited the qualities which distinguished his genius from the
449,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"beginning, and were marked by characteristics which were rather acquired"
450,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"than inherited. In other words, they were somewhat different from those"
451,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,which were written at Great Barrington. The Hellenic element was still
452,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"visible in ""The Greek Partisan"" and ""The Greek Boy,"" and the aboriginal"
453,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"element in ""The Disinterred Warrior."" The large imagination of ""The Hymn"
454,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"to the North Star"" was radiant in ""The Firmament,"" and in ""The Past."""
455,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Ardent love of nature found expressive utterance in ""Lines on Revisiting"
456,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"the Country,"" ""The Gladness of Nature,"" ""A Summer Ramble,"" ""A Scene on"
457,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"the Banks of the Hudson,"" and ""The Evening Wind."" The little book of"
458,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"immortal dirges had a fresh leaf added to it in ""The Death of the"
459,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Flowers,"" which was at once a pastoral of autumn and a monody over a"
460,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"beloved sister. A new element appeared in ""The Summer Wind,"" and was"
461,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,always present afterward in Mr. Bryant's meditative poetry--the
462,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,association of humanity with nature--a calm but sympathetic recognition
463,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,of the ways of man and his presence on the earth. The power of
464,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"suggestion and of rapid generalization, which was the key-note of ""The"
465,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Ages,"" lived anew in every line of ""The Prairies,"" in which a series of"
466,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,poems present themselves to the imagination as a series of pictures in a
467,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,gallery--pictures in which breadth and vigor of treatment and exquisite
468,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"delicacy of detail are everywhere harmoniously blended, and the unity of"
469,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,pure Art is attained. It was worth going to the ends of the world to be
470,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"able to write ""The Prairies."""
471,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
472,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Confiding in the discretion of his associate Mr. Leggett, and anxious to"
473,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"escape from his daily editorial labors, Mr. Bryant sailed for Europe"
474,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,with his family in the summer of 1834. It was his intention to perfect
475,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"his literary studies while abroad, and to devote himself to the"
476,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"education of his children; but his intention was frustrated, after a"
477,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"short course of travel in France, Germany, and Italy, by the illness of"
478,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Mr. Leggett, whose mistaken zeal in the advocacy of unpopular measures"
479,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,had seriously injured the _Evening Post_. He returned in haste early in
480,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"1836, and devoted his time and energies to restoring the prosperity of"
481,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"his paper. Nine years passed before he ventured to return to Europe,"
482,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,though he managed to visit certain portions of his own country. His
483,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,readers tracked his journeys through the letters which he wrote to the
484,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"_Evening Post_, and which were noticeable for justness of observation"
485,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,and clearness of expression. A selection from Mr. Bryant's foreign and
486,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"home letters was published in 1852, under the title of ""Letters of a"
487,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Traveler."""
488,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
489,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"The life of a man of letters is seldom eventful. There are, of course,"
490,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"exceptions to the rule; for literature, like other polite professions,"
491,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,is never without its disorderly followers. It is instructive to trace
492,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"their careers, which are usually short ones; but the contemplation of"
493,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"the calm, well-regulated, self-respecting lives of the elder and wiser"
494,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"masters is much more satisfactory. We pity the Maginns, and Mangans, and"
495,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Poes, whom we have always with us; but we admire and reverence such"
496,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"writers as Wordsworth, and Thackeray, and Bryant, who dignify their high"
497,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,calling. The last thirty years of the life of Mr. Bryant were devoid of
498,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"incidents, though one of them (1866) was not without the supreme"
499,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,sorrow--death. He devoted himself to journalism as conscientiously as if
500,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"he still had his spurs to win, discussing all public questions with"
501,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"independence and fearlessness; and from time to time, as the spirit"
502,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"moved him, he added to our treasures of song, contributing to the"
503,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"popular magazines of the period, and occasionally issuing these"
504,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"contributions in separate volumes. He published ""The Fountain and Other"
505,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Poems"" in 1842; ""The White-Footed Deer and Other Poems"" in 1844; a"
506,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"collected edition of his poems, with illustrations by Leutze, in 1846;"
507,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"an edition in two volumes in 1855; ""Thirty Poems"" in 1866; and in 1876 a"
508,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,complete illustrated edition of his poetical writings. To the honors
509,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,which these volumes brought him he added fresh laurels in 1870 and 1871
510,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"by the publication of his translation of the ""Iliad"" and the"
511,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"""Odyssey""--a translation which was highly praised both at home and"
512,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"abroad, and which, if not the best that the English language is capable"
513,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"of, is, in many respects, the best which any English-writing poet has"
514,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,yet produced.
515,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
516,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,There comes a day in the intellectual lives of most poets when their
517,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"powers cease to be progressive and productive, or are productive only in"
518,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"the forms to which they have accustomed themselves, and which have"
519,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,become mannerisms. It was not so with Mr. Bryant. He enjoyed the
520,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,dangerous distinction of proving himself a great poet at an early age;
521,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"he preserved this distinction to the last, for the sixty-four years"
522,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"which elapsed between the writing of ""Thanatopsis"" and the writing of"
523,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"""The Flood of Years"" witnessed no decay of his poetic capacities, but"
524,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,rather the growth and development of trains of thought and forms of
525,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,verse of which there was no evidence in his early writings. His
526,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"sympathies were enlarged as the years went on, and the crystal clearness"
527,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,of his mind was colored with human emotions.
528,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
529,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"To Bryant, beyond all other modern poets, the earth was a theatre upon"
530,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,which the great drama of life was everlastingly played. The remembrance
531,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"of this fact is his inspiration in ""The Fountain,"" ""An Evening Revery,"""
532,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"""The Antiquity of Freedom,"" ""The Crowded Street,"" ""The Planting of the"
533,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Apple-Tree,"" ""The Night Journey of a River,"" ""The Sower,"" and ""The Flood"
534,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"of Years."" The most poetical of Mr. Bryant's poems are, perhaps, ""The"
535,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Land of Dreams,"" ""The Burial of Love,"" ""The May Sun sheds an Amber"
536,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Light,"" and ""The Voice of Autumn;"" and they were written in a succession"
537,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"of happy hours, and in the order named. Next to these pieces, as"
538,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"examples of pure poetry, should be placed ""Sella"" and ""The Little People"
539,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"of the Snow,"" which are exquisite fairy fantasies. The qualities by"
540,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,which Mr. Bryant's poetry are chiefly distinguished are serenity and
541,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,gravity of thought; an intense though repressed recognition of the
542,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,mortality of mankind; an ardent love for human freedom; and unrivaled
543,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,skill in painting the scenery of his native land. He had no superior in
544,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"this walk of poetic art--it might almost be said no equal, for his"
545,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"descriptions of nature are never inaccurate or redundant. ""The"
546,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Excursion"" is a tiresome poem, which contains several exquisite"
547,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"episodes. Mr. Bryant knew how to write exquisite episodes, and to omit"
548,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,the platitudes through which we reach them in other poets.
549,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
550,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,It is not given to many poets to possess as many residences as Mr.
551,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Bryant, for he had three--a town-house in New York, a country-house,"
552,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"called ""Cedarmere,"" at Roslyn, Long Island, and the old homestead of the"
553,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Bryant family at Cummington. He passed the winter months in New York,"
554,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,and the summer and early autumn months at his country-houses. No
555,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,distinguished man in America was better known by sight than he.
556,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
557,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"""O good gray head that all men knew"""
558,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
559,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,rose unbidden to one's lips as he passed his fellow-pedestrians in the
560,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"streets of the great city, active, alert, with a springing step and a"
561,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"buoyant gait. He was seen in all weathers, walking down to his office in"
562,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"the morning, and back to his house in the afternoon--an observant"
563,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"antiquity, with a majestic white beard, a pair of sharp eyes, and a face"
564,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"which, noticed closely, recalled the line of the poet:"
565,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
566,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"""A million wrinkles carved his skin."""
567,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
568,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Mr. Bryant had a peculiar talent, in which the French excel--the talent"
569,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,of delivering discourses upon the lives and writings of eminent men; and
570,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,he was always in request after the death of his contemporaries.
571,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,
572,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Beginning with a eulogy on his friend Cole, the painter, who died in"

574,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Irving, and assisted at the dedication in the Central Park of the Morse,"
575,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Shakespeare, Scott, and Halleck monuments. His addresses on those"
576,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"occasions, and others that might be named, were models of justice of"
577,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,appreciation and felicity of expression. His last public appearance was
578,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"at the Central Park, on the afternoon of May 29, 1878, at the unveiling"
579,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"of a statue to Mazzini. It was an unusually hot day, and after"
580,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"delivering his address, which was remarkable for its eloquence, he"
581,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"accompanied General James Grant Wilson, an acquaintance of some years'"
582,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"standing, to his residence in East Seventy-fourth street. General Wilson"
583,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,reached his door with Mr. Bryant leaning on his arm; he took a step in
584,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"advance to open the inner door, and while his back was turned the poet"
585,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"fell, striking his head on the stone platform of the front steps. It was"
586,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"his death-blow; for, though he recovered his consciousness sufficiently"
587,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"to converse a little, and was able to ride to his own house with General"
588,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"Wilson, his fate was sealed. He lingered until the morning of the 12th"
589,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,"of June, when his capacious spirit passed out into the Unknown. Two days"
590,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,later all that was mortal of him was buried beside the grave of his wife
591,WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.,at Roslyn.

1541,GREEN RIVER.,"Where wanders the stream with waters of green,"
1542,GREEN RIVER.,As if the bright fringe of herbs on its brink
1543,GREEN RIVER.,Had given their stain to the waves they drink;
1544,GREEN RIVER.,"And they, whose meadows it murmurs through,"
1545,GREEN RIVER.,Have named the stream from its own fair hue.
1546,GREEN RIVER.,Yet pure its waters--its shallows are bright
1547,GREEN RIVER.,"With colored pebbles and sparkles of light,"
1548,GREEN RIVER.,"And clear the depths where its eddies play,"
1549,GREEN RIVER.,"And dimples deepen and whirl away,"
1550,GREEN RIVER.,And the plane-tree's speckled arms o'ershoot
1551,GREEN RIVER.,"The swifter current that mines its root,"
1552,GREEN RIVER.,"Through whose shifting leaves, as you walk the hill,"
1553,GREEN RIVER.,The quivering glimmer of sun and rill
1554,GREEN RIVER.,"With a sudden flash on the eye is thrown,"

1556,GREEN RIVER.,"Oh, loveliest there the spring days come,"
1557,GREEN RIVER.,"With blossoms, and birds, and wild-bees' hum;"
1558,GREEN RIVER.,"The flowers of summer are fairest there,"
1559,GREEN RIVER.,And freshest the breath of the summer air;
1560,GREEN RIVER.,And sweetest the golden autumn day
1561,GREEN RIVER.,In silence and sunshine glides away.
1562,GREEN RIVER.,
1563,GREEN RIVER.,"Yet, fair as thou art, thou shunnest to glide,"
1564,GREEN RIVER.,Beautiful stream! by the village side;
1565,GREEN RIVER.,"But windest away from haunts of men,"
1566,GREEN RIVER.,To quiet valley and shaded glen;
1567,GREEN RIVER.,"And forest, and meadow, and slope of hill,"
1568,GREEN RIVER.,"Around thee, are lonely, lovely, and still,"
1569,GREEN RIVER.,"Lonely--save when, by thy rippling tides,"
1570,GREEN RIVER.,From thicket to thicket the angler glides;
1571,GREEN RIVER.,"Or the simpler comes, with basket and book,"
1572,GREEN RIVER.,For herbs of power on thy banks to look;
1573,GREEN RIVER.,"Or haply, some idle dreamer, like me,"
1574,GREEN RIVER.,"To wander, and muse, and gaze on thee,"
1575,GREEN RIVER.,Still--save the chirp of birds that feed
1576,GREEN RIVER.,"On the river cherry and seedy reed,"
1577,GREEN RIVER.,And thy own wild music gushing out
1578,GREEN RIVER.,"With mellow murmur of fairy shout,"

1580,GREEN RIVER.,Like traveller singing along his way.
1581,GREEN RIVER.,
1582,GREEN RIVER.,"That fairy music I never hear,"

1585,GREEN RIVER.,"Darkened with shade or flashing with light,"
1586,GREEN RIVER.,"While o'er them the vine to its thicket clings,"
1587,GREEN RIVER.,"And the zephyr stoops to freshen his wings,"
1588,GREEN RIVER.,But I wish that fate had left me free
1589,GREEN RIVER.,"To wander these quiet haunts with thee,"
1590,GREEN RIVER.,"Till the eating cares of earth should depart,"
1591,GREEN RIVER.,And the peace of the scene pass into my heart;
1592,GREEN RIVER.,"And I envy thy stream, as it glides along"
1593,GREEN RIVER.,Through its beautiful banks in a trance of song.
1594,GREEN RIVER.,
1595,GREEN RIVER.,"Though forced to drudge for the dregs of men,"
1596,GREEN RIVER.,"And scrawl strange words with the barbarous pen,"
1597,GREEN RIVER.,"And mingle among the jostling crowd,"
1598,GREEN RIVER.,Where the sons of strife are subtle and loud--
1599,GREEN RIVER.,"I often come to this quiet place,"
1600,GREEN RIVER.,"To breathe the airs that ruffle thy face,"
1601,GREEN RIVER.,"And gaze upon thee in silent dream,"
1602,GREEN RIVER.,For in thy lonely and lovely stream

1610,A WINTER PIECE.,
1611,A WINTER PIECE.,
1612,A WINTER PIECE.,"The time has been that these wild solitudes,"
1613,A WINTER PIECE.,"Yet beautiful as wild, were trod by me"
1614,A WINTER PIECE.,Oftener than now; and when the ills of life
1615,A WINTER PIECE.,Had chafed my spirit--when the unsteady pulse
1616,A WINTER PIECE.,Beat with strange flutterings--I would wander forth
1617,A WINTER PIECE.,And seek the woods. The sunshine on my path
1618,A WINTER PIECE.,"Was to me as a friend. The swelling hills,"
1619,A WINTER PIECE.,"The quiet dells retiring far between,"
1620,A WINTER PIECE.,With gentle invitation to explore
1621,A WINTER PIECE.,"Their windings, were a calm society"
1622,A WINTER PIECE.,That talked with me and soothed me. Then the chant
1623,A WINTER PIECE.,"Of birds, and chime of brooks, and soft caress"
1624,A WINTER PIECE.,"Of the fresh sylvan air, made me forget"
1625,A WINTER PIECE.,"The thoughts that broke my peace, and I began"
1626,A WINTER PIECE.,"To gather simples by the fountain's brink,"
1627,A WINTER PIECE.,And lose myself in day-dreams. While I stood
1628,A WINTER PIECE.,"In Nature's loneliness, I was with one"
1629,A WINTER PIECE.,"With whom I early grew familiar, one"
1630,A WINTER PIECE.,"Who never had a frown for me, whose voice"
1631,A WINTER PIECE.,Never rebuked me for the hours I stole
1632,A WINTER PIECE.,"From cares I loved not, but of which the world"
1633,A WINTER PIECE.,"Deems highest, to converse with her. When shrieked"
1634,A WINTER PIECE.,"The bleak November winds, and smote the woods,"
1635,A WINTER PIECE.,"And the brown fields were herbless, and the shades."
1636,A WINTER PIECE.,That met above the merry rivulet.
1637,A WINTER PIECE.,"Were spoiled, I sought, I loved them still; they seemed"
1638,A WINTER PIECE.,Like old companions in adversity.
1639,A WINTER PIECE.,"Still there was beauty in my walks; the brook,"
1640,A WINTER PIECE.,"Bordered with sparkling frost-work, was as gay"
1641,A WINTER PIECE.,"As with its fringe of summer flowers. Afar,"
1642,A WINTER PIECE.,"The village with its spires, the path of streams"
1643,A WINTER PIECE.,"And dim receding valleys, hid before"
1644,A WINTER PIECE.,"By interposing trees, lay visible"
1645,A WINTER PIECE.,"Through the bare grove, and my familiar haunts"
1646,A WINTER PIECE.,Seemed new to me. Nor was I slow to come
1647,A WINTER PIECE.,"Among them, when the clouds, from their still skirts,"
1648,A WINTER PIECE.,"Had shaken down on earth the feathery snow,"
1649,A WINTER PIECE.,"And all was white. The pure keen air abroad,"
1650,A WINTER PIECE.,"Albeit it breathed no scent of herb, nor heard"
1651,A WINTER PIECE.,"Love-call of bird nor merry hum of bee,"
1652,A WINTER PIECE.,"Was not the air of death, Bright mosses crept"
1653,A WINTER PIECE.,"Over the spotted trunks, and the close buds,"
1654,A WINTER PIECE.,"That lay along the boughs, instinct with life,"
1655,A WINTER PIECE.,"Patient, and waiting the soft breath of Spring,"
1656,A WINTER PIECE.,Feared not the piercing spirit of the North.
1657,A WINTER PIECE.,"The snow-bird twittered on the beechen bough,"
1658,A WINTER PIECE.,"And 'neath the hemlock, whose thick branches bent"
1659,A WINTER PIECE.,"Beneath its bright cold burden, and kept dry"
1660,A WINTER PIECE.,"A circle, on the earth, of withered leaves,"
1661,A WINTER PIECE.,The partridge found a shelter. Through the snow
1662,A WINTER PIECE.,The rabbit sprang away. The lighter track
1663,A WINTER PIECE.,"Of fox, and the raccoon's broad path, were there,"
1664,A WINTER PIECE.,Crossing each other. From his hollow tree
1665,A WINTER PIECE.,"The squirrel was abroad, gathering the nuts"
1666,A WINTER PIECE.,"Just fallen, that asked the winter cold and sway"
1667,A WINTER PIECE.,"Of winter blast, to shake them from their hold."
1668,A WINTER PIECE.,
1669,A WINTER PIECE.,But Winter has yet brighter scenes--he boasts
1670,A WINTER PIECE.,Splendors beyond what gorgeous Summer knows;
1671,A WINTER PIECE.,"Or Autumn with his many fruits, and woods"
1672,A WINTER PIECE.,All flushed with many hues. Come when the rains
1673,A WINTER PIECE.,"Have glazed the snow and clothed the trees with ice,"
1674,A WINTER PIECE.,While the slant sun of February pours
1675,A WINTER PIECE.,Into the bowers a flood of light. Approach!
1676,A WINTER PIECE.,"The incrusted surface shall upbear thy steps,"
1677,A WINTER PIECE.,And the broad arching portals of the grove
1678,A WINTER PIECE.,Welcome thy entering. Look! the massy trunks
1679,A WINTER PIECE.,"Are cased in the pure crystal; each light spray,"
1680,A WINTER PIECE.,"Nodding and tinkling in the breath of heaven,"
1681,A WINTER PIECE.,"Is studded with its trembling water-drops,"
1682,A WINTER PIECE.,That glimmer with an amethystine light.
1683,A WINTER PIECE.,But round the parent-stem the long low boughs
1684,A WINTER PIECE.,"Bend, in a glittering ring, and arbors hide"
1685,A WINTER PIECE.,The glassy floor. Oh! you might deem the spot
1686,A WINTER PIECE.,"The spacious cavern of some virgin mine,"
1687,A WINTER PIECE.,"Deep in the womb of earth--where the gems grow,"
1688,A WINTER PIECE.,And diamonds put forth radiant rods and bud
1689,A WINTER PIECE.,With amethyst and topaz--and the place
1690,A WINTER PIECE.,"Lit up, most royally, with the pure beam"
1691,A WINTER PIECE.,That dwells in them. Or haply the vast hall
1692,A WINTER PIECE.,"Of fairy palace, that outlasts the night,"
1693,A WINTER PIECE.,And fades not in the glory of the sun;--
1694,A WINTER PIECE.,Where crystal columns send forth slender shafts
1695,A WINTER PIECE.,And crossing arches; and fantastic aisles
1696,A WINTER PIECE.,"Wind from the sight in brightness, and are lost"
1697,A WINTER PIECE.,Among the crowded pillars. Raise thine eye;
1698,A WINTER PIECE.,"Thou seest no cavern roof, no palace vault;"
1699,A WINTER PIECE.,There the blue sky and the white drifting cloud
1700,A WINTER PIECE.,Look in. Again the wildered fancy dreams
1701,A WINTER PIECE.,"Of spouting fountains, frozen as they rose,"
1702,A WINTER PIECE.,"And fixed, with all their branching jets, in air,"
1703,A WINTER PIECE.,"And all their sluices sealed. All, all is light;"
1704,A WINTER PIECE.,Light without shade. But all shall pass away
1705,A WINTER PIECE.,With the next sun. From numberless vast trunks
1706,A WINTER PIECE.,"Loosened, the crashing ice shall make a sound"
1707,A WINTER PIECE.,"Like the far roar of rivers, and the eve"
1708,A WINTER PIECE.,Shall close o'er the brown woods as it was wont.
1709,A WINTER PIECE.,
1710,A WINTER PIECE.,"And it is pleasant, when the noisy streams"
1711,A WINTER PIECE.,"Are just set free, and milder suns melt off"
1712,A WINTER PIECE.,"The plashy snow, save only the firm drift"
1713,A WINTER PIECE.,In the deep glen or the close shade of pines--
1714,A WINTER PIECE.,'Tis pleasant to behold the wreaths of smoke
1715,A WINTER PIECE.,"Roll up among the maples of the hill,"
1716,A WINTER PIECE.,Where the shrill sound of youthful voices wakes
1717,A WINTER PIECE.,"The shriller echo, as the clear pure lymph,"
1718,A WINTER PIECE.,"That from the wounded trees, in twinkling drops,"
1719,A WINTER PIECE.,"Falls, mid the golden brightness of the morn,"
1720,A WINTER PIECE.,"Is gathered in with brimming pails, and oft,"
1721,A WINTER PIECE.,"Wielded by sturdy hands, the stroke of axe"
1722,A WINTER PIECE.,"Makes the woods ring. Along the quiet air,"
1723,A WINTER PIECE.,"Come and float calmly off the soft light clouds,"
1724,A WINTER PIECE.,"Such as you see in summer, and the winds"
1725,A WINTER PIECE.,"Scarce stir the branches. Lodged in sunny cleft,"
1726,A WINTER PIECE.,"Where the cold breezes come not, blooms alone"
1727,A WINTER PIECE.,"The little wind-flower, whose just opened eye"
1728,A WINTER PIECE.,Is blue as the spring heaven it gazes at--
1729,A WINTER PIECE.,Startling the loiterer in the naked groves
1730,A WINTER PIECE.,"With unexpected beauty, for the time"
1731,A WINTER PIECE.,Of blossoms and green leaves is yet afar.
1732,A WINTER PIECE.,"And ere it comes, the encountering winds shall oft"
1733,A WINTER PIECE.,"Muster their wrath again, and rapid clouds"
1734,A WINTER PIECE.,"Shade heaven, and bounding on the frozen earth"
1735,A WINTER PIECE.,"Shall fall their volleyed stores, rounded like hail"
1736,A WINTER PIECE.,"And white like snow, and the loud North again"
1737,A WINTER PIECE.,Shall buffet the vexed forest in his rage.

1949,A WALK AT SUNSET.,
1950,A WALK AT SUNSET.,"For ages, on the silent forests here,"

2085,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Shows to the faint of spirit the right path,"
2086,HYMN TO DEATH.,"And he is warned, and fears to step aside."
2087,HYMN TO DEATH.,Thou sett'st between the ruffian and his crime

2089,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Drops the drawn knife. But, oh, most fearfully"
2090,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Dost thou show forth Heaven's justice, when thy shafts"

2092,HYMN TO DEATH.,Of heart and violent of hand restores
2093,HYMN TO DEATH.,The treasure to the friendless wretch he wronged.
2094,HYMN TO DEATH.,Then from the writhing bosom thou dost pluck
2095,HYMN TO DEATH.,"The guilty secret; lips, for ages sealed,"
2096,HYMN TO DEATH.,"Are faithless to their dreadful trust at length,"
2097,HYMN TO DEATH.,And give it up; the felon's latest breath

2100,HYMN TO DEATH.,Recalls the deadly obloquy he forged
2101,HYMN TO DEATH.,To work his brother's ruin. Thou dost make

2770,FATHERS.,
2771,FATHERS.,It is the spot I came to seek--
2772,FATHERS.,"My father's ancient burial-place,"
2773,FATHERS.,"Ere from these vales, ashamed and weak,"
2774,FATHERS.,Withdrew our wasted race.
2775,FATHERS.,It is the spot--I know it well---
2776,FATHERS.,Of which our old traditions tell.
2777,FATHERS.,
2778,FATHERS.,For here the upland bank sends out
2779,FATHERS.,A ridge toward the river-side;
2780,FATHERS.,"I know the shaggy hills about,"
2781,FATHERS.,"The meadows smooth and wide,"
2782,FATHERS.,"The plains, that, toward the southern sky,"
2783,FATHERS.,Fenced east and west by mountains lie.
2784,FATHERS.,
2785,FATHERS.,"A white man, gazing on the scene,"
2786,FATHERS.,"Would say a lovely spot was here,"
2787,FATHERS.,"And praise the lawns, so fresh and green,"
2788,FATHERS.,Between the hills so sheer.
2789,FATHERS.,I like it not--I would the plain
2790,FATHERS.,Lay in its tall old groves again.
2791,FATHERS.,
2792,FATHERS.,"The sheep are on the slopes around,"
2793,FATHERS.,"The cattle in the meadows feed,"
2794,FATHERS.,"And laborers turn the crumbling ground,"

2796,FATHERS.,"And prancing steeds, in trappings gay,"
2797,FATHERS.,Whirl the bright chariot o'er the way.
2798,FATHERS.,
2799,FATHERS.,Methinks it were a nobler sight
2800,FATHERS.,"To see these vales in woods arrayed,"
2801,FATHERS.,"Their summits in the golden light,"
2802,FATHERS.,"Their trunks in grateful shade,"
2803,FATHERS.,And herds of deer that bounding go
2804,FATHERS.,O'er hills and prostrate trees below.
2805,FATHERS.,
2806,FATHERS.,"And then to mark the lord of all,"
2807,FATHERS.,"The forest hero, trained to wars,"
2808,FATHERS.,"Quivered and plumed, and lithe and tall,"
2809,FATHERS.,"And seamed with glorious scars,"
2810,FATHERS.,"Walk forth, amid his reign, to dare"

2812,FATHERS.,
2813,FATHERS.,"This bank, in which the dead were laid,"
2814,FATHERS.,Was sacred when its soil was ours;
2815,FATHERS.,Hither the silent Indian maid
2816,FATHERS.,"Brought wreaths of beads and flowers,"
2817,FATHERS.,And the gray chief and gifted seer
2818,FATHERS.,Worshipped the god of thunders here.
2819,FATHERS.,
2820,FATHERS.,But now the wheat is green and high
2821,FATHERS.,"On clods that hid the warrior's breast,"
2822,FATHERS.,And scattered in the furrows lie
2823,FATHERS.,The weapons of his rest;
2824,FATHERS.,"And there, in the loose sand, is thrown"
2825,FATHERS.,Of his large arm the mouldering bone.
2826,FATHERS.,
2827,FATHERS.,"Ah, little thought the strong and brave"

2829,FATHERS.,Or the young wife that weeping gave
2830,FATHERS.,"Her first-born to the earth,"
2831,FATHERS.,"That the pale race, who waste us now,"
2832,FATHERS.,Among their bones should guide the plough.
2833,FATHERS.,
2834,FATHERS.,They waste us--ay--like April snow
2835,FATHERS.,"In the warm noon, we shrink away;"
2836,FATHERS.,"And fast they follow, as we go"
2837,FATHERS.,Toward the setting day--
2838,FATHERS.,"Till they shall fill the land, and we"
2839,FATHERS.,Are driven into the Western sea.
2840,FATHERS.,
2841,FATHERS.,"But I behold a fearful sign,"
2842,FATHERS.,To which the white men's eyes are blind;
2843,FATHERS.,"Their race may vanish hence, like mine,"
2844,FATHERS.,"And leave no trace behind,"
2845,FATHERS.,"Save ruins o'er the region spread,"
2846,FATHERS.,And the white stones above the dead.
2847,FATHERS.,
2848,FATHERS.,"Before these fields were shorn and tilled,"
2849,FATHERS.,Full to the brim our rivers flowed;
2850,FATHERS.,The melody of waters filled
2851,FATHERS.,The fresh and boundless wood;
2852,FATHERS.,"And torrents dashed and rivulets played,"
2853,FATHERS.,And fountains spouted in the shade.
2854,FATHERS.,
2855,FATHERS.,"Those grateful sounds are heard no more,"
2856,FATHERS.,The springs are silent in the sun;
2857,FATHERS.,"The rivers, by the blackened shore,"
2858,FATHERS.,With lessening current run;

3008,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,"With wealth of raven tresses, a light form,"
3009,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,And a gay heart. About her cabin-door

3012,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,"She loved her cousin; such a love was deemed,"
3013,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,"By the morality of those stern tribes,"
3014,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,"Incestuous, and she struggled hard and long"
3015,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,"Against her love, and reasoned with her heart,"

3017,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,"Then her eye lost its lustre, and her step"

3020,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,"The accustomed song and laugh of her, whose looks"

3023,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,"To weep where no eye saw, and was not found"
3024,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,"Where all the merry girls were met to dance,"
3025,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,And all the hunters of the tribe were out;
3026,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,Nor when they gathered from the rustling husk
3027,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,"The shining ear; nor when, by the river's side,"
3028,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,They pulled the grape and startled the wild shades
3029,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,With sounds of mirth. The keen-eyed Indian dames
3030,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,"Would whisper to each other, as they saw"

3033,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,"One day into the bosom of a friend,"

3038,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,"All night I weep in darkness, and the morn"
3039,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,"Glares on me, as upon a thing accursed,"
3040,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,That has no business on the earth. I hate
3041,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,The pastimes and the pleasant toils that once
3042,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,I loved; the cheerful voices of my friends
3043,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,"Sound in my ear like mockings, and, at night,"
3044,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,"In dreams, my mother, from the land of souls,"
3045,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,Calls me and chides me. All that look on me
3046,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,Do seem to know my shame; I cannot bear

3048,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,"The love that wrings it so, and I must die."""
3049,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,
3050,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,"It was a summer morning, and they went"

3052,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,"Lay garlands, ears of maize, and shaggy skins"

3054,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,"Here made to the Great Spirit, for they deemed,"
3055,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,"Like worshippers of the elder time, that God"
3056,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,Doth walk on the high places and affect
3057,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,The earth-o'erlooking mountains. She had on
3058,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,The ornaments with which her father loved
3059,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,"To deck the beauty of his bright-eyed girl,"
3060,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,And bade her wear when stranger warriors came

3062,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,"And sang, all day, old songs of love and death,"
3063,MONUMENT MOUNTAIN.,"And decked the poor wan victim's hair with flowers,"

3600,A FOREST HYMN.,"To hew the shaft, and lay the architrave,"
3601,A FOREST HYMN.,And spread the roof above them--ere he framed
3602,A FOREST HYMN.,"The lofty vault, to gather and roll back"
3603,A FOREST HYMN.,"The sound of anthems; in the darkling wood,"
3604,A FOREST HYMN.,"Amid the cool and silence, he knelt down,"
3605,A FOREST HYMN.,And offered to the Mightiest solemn thanks
3606,A FOREST HYMN.,And supplication. For his simple heart
3607,A FOREST HYMN.,Might not resist the sacred influences
3608,A FOREST HYMN.,"Which, from the stilly twilight of the place,"
3609,A FOREST HYMN.,And from the gray old trunks that high in heaven
3610,A FOREST HYMN.,"Mingled their mossy boughs, and from the sound"
3611,A FOREST HYMN.,Of the invisible breath that swayed at once
3612,A FOREST HYMN.,"All their green tops, stole over him, and bowed"
3613,A FOREST HYMN.,His spirit with the thought of boundless power
3614,A FOREST HYMN.,"And inaccessible majesty. Ah, why"
3615,A FOREST HYMN.,"Should we, in the world's riper years, neglect"
3616,A FOREST HYMN.,"God's ancient sanctuaries, and adore"
3617,A FOREST HYMN.,"Only among the crowd, and under roofs"
3618,A FOREST HYMN.,"That our frail hands have raised? Let me, at least,"
3619,A FOREST HYMN.,"Here, in the shadow of this aged wood,"
3620,A FOREST HYMN.,"Offer one hymn--thrice happy, if it find"
3621,A FOREST HYMN.,Acceptance in His ear.
3622,A FOREST HYMN.,
3623,A FOREST HYMN.,"Father, thy hand"
3624,A FOREST HYMN.,"Hath reared these venerable columns, thou"
3625,A FOREST HYMN.,Didst weave this verdant roof. Thou didst look down
3626,A FOREST HYMN.,"Upon the naked earth, and, forthwith, rose"
3627,A FOREST HYMN.,"All these fair ranks of trees. They, in thy sun,"
3628,A FOREST HYMN.,"Budded, and shook their green leaves in thy breeze,"
3629,A FOREST HYMN.,And shot toward heaven. The century-living crow
3630,A FOREST HYMN.,"Whose birth was in their tops, grew old and died"
3631,A FOREST HYMN.,"Among their branches, till, at last, they stood,"
3632,A FOREST HYMN.,"As now they stand, massy, and tall, and dark,"
3633,A FOREST HYMN.,Fit shrine for humble worshipper to hold
3634,A FOREST HYMN.,"Communion with his Maker. These dim vaults,"
3635,A FOREST HYMN.,"These winding aisles, of human pomp or pride"
3636,A FOREST HYMN.,Report not. No fantastic carvings show
3637,A FOREST HYMN.,The boast of our vain race to change the form
3638,A FOREST HYMN.,Of thy fair works. But thou art here--thou fill'st
3639,A FOREST HYMN.,The solitude. Thou art in the soft winds
3640,A FOREST HYMN.,That run along the summit of these trees
3641,A FOREST HYMN.,In music; thou art in the cooler breath
3642,A FOREST HYMN.,That from the inmost darkness of the place
3643,A FOREST HYMN.,"Comes, scarcely felt; the barky trunks, the ground,"
3644,A FOREST HYMN.,"The fresh moist ground, are all instinct with thee."
3645,A FOREST HYMN.,"Here is continual worship;--Nature, here,"
3646,A FOREST HYMN.,"In the tranquillity that thou dost love,"
3647,A FOREST HYMN.,"Enjoys thy presence. Noiselessly, around,"
3648,A FOREST HYMN.,"From perch to perch, the solitary bird"
3649,A FOREST HYMN.,"Passes; and yon clear spring, that, midst its herbs,"
3650,A FOREST HYMN.,Wells softly forth and wandering steeps the roots
3651,A FOREST HYMN.,"Of half the mighty forest, tells no tale"
3652,A FOREST HYMN.,Of all the good it does. Thou hast not left
3653,A FOREST HYMN.,"Thyself without a witness, in the shades,"
3654,A FOREST HYMN.,"Of thy perfections. Grandeur, strength, and grace"
3655,A FOREST HYMN.,Are here to speak of thee. This mighty oak--
3656,A FOREST HYMN.,By whose immovable stem I stand and seem
3657,A FOREST HYMN.,"Almost annihilated--not a prince,"
3658,A FOREST HYMN.,"In all that proud old world beyond the deep,"
3659,A FOREST HYMN.,E'er wore his crown as loftily as he
3660,A FOREST HYMN.,Wears the green coronal of leaves with which
3661,A FOREST HYMN.,Thy hand has graced him. Nestled at his root
3662,A FOREST HYMN.,"Is beauty, such as blooms not in the glare"
3663,A FOREST HYMN.,"Of the broad sun. That delicate forest flower,"
3664,A FOREST HYMN.,"With scented breath and look so like a smile,"
3665,A FOREST HYMN.,"Seems, as it issues from the shapeless mould,"
3666,A FOREST HYMN.,"An emanation of the indwelling Life,"
3667,A FOREST HYMN.,"A visible token of the upholding Love,"
3668,A FOREST HYMN.,That are the soul of this great universe.
3669,A FOREST HYMN.,
3670,A FOREST HYMN.,My heart is awed within me when I think
3671,A FOREST HYMN.,"Of the great miracle that still goes on,"
3672,A FOREST HYMN.,"In silence, round me--the perpetual work"
3673,A FOREST HYMN.,"Of thy creation, finished, yet renewed"
3674,A FOREST HYMN.,Forever. Written on thy works I read
3675,A FOREST HYMN.,The lesson of thy own eternity.
3676,A FOREST HYMN.,"Lo! all grow old and die--but see again,"
3677,A FOREST HYMN.,How on the faltering footsteps of decay
3678,A FOREST HYMN.,Youth presses--ever gay and beautiful youth
3679,A FOREST HYMN.,In all its beautiful forms. These lofty trees
3680,A FOREST HYMN.,Wave not less proudly that their ancestors
3681,A FOREST HYMN.,"Moulder beneath them. Oh, there is not lost"
3682,A FOREST HYMN.,"One of earth's charms: upon her bosom yet,"
3683,A FOREST HYMN.,"After the flight of untold centuries,"
3684,A FOREST HYMN.,The freshness of her far beginning lies
3685,A FOREST HYMN.,And yet shall lie. Life mocks the idle hate
3686,A FOREST HYMN.,"Of his arch-enemy Death--yea, seats himself"
3687,A FOREST HYMN.,"Upon the tyrant's throne--the sepulchre,"
3688,A FOREST HYMN.,And of the triumphs of his ghastly foe
3689,A FOREST HYMN.,Makes his own nourishment. For he came forth
3690,A FOREST HYMN.,"From thine own bosom, and shall have no end."
3691,A FOREST HYMN.,
3692,A FOREST HYMN.,There have been holy men who hid themselves
3693,A FOREST HYMN.,"Deep in the woody wilderness, and gave"
3694,A FOREST HYMN.,"Their lives to thought and prayer, till they outlived"
3695,A FOREST HYMN.,"The generation born with them, nor seemed"
3696,A FOREST HYMN.,Less aged than the hoary trees and rocks
3697,A FOREST HYMN.,Around them;--and there have been holy men
3698,A FOREST HYMN.,Who deemed it were not well to pass life thus.
3699,A FOREST HYMN.,But let me often to these solitudes
3700,A FOREST HYMN.,"Retire, and in thy presence reassure"
3701,A FOREST HYMN.,"My feeble virtue. Here its enemies,"
3702,A FOREST HYMN.,"The passions, at thy plainer footsteps shrink"
3703,A FOREST HYMN.,And tremble and are still. O God! when thou
3704,A FOREST HYMN.,"Dost scare the world with tempests, set on fire"
3705,A FOREST HYMN.,"The heavens with falling thunderbolts, or fill,"
3706,A FOREST HYMN.,"With all the waters of the firmament,"
3707,A FOREST HYMN.,The swift dark whirlwind that uproots the woods
3708,A FOREST HYMN.,"And drowns the villages; when, at thy call,"
3709,A FOREST HYMN.,Uprises the great deep and throws himself
3710,A FOREST HYMN.,"Upon the continent, and overwhelms"
3711,A FOREST HYMN.,"Its cities--who forgets not, at the sight"
3712,A FOREST HYMN.,"Of these tremendous tokens of thy power,"
3713,A FOREST HYMN.,"His pride, and lays his strifes and follies by?"
3714,A FOREST HYMN.,"Oh, from these sterner aspects of thy face"
3715,A FOREST HYMN.,"Spare me and mine, nor let us need the wrath"
3716,A FOREST HYMN.,Of the mad unchained elements to teach
3717,A FOREST HYMN.,"Who rules them. Be it ours to meditate,"
3718,A FOREST HYMN.,"In these calm shades, thy milder majesty,"

5743,THE PRAIRIES.,"Heaped, with long toil, the earth, while yet the Greek"
5744,THE PRAIRIES.,Was hewing the Pentelicus to forms
5745,THE PRAIRIES.,"Of symmetry, and rearing on its rock"
5746,THE PRAIRIES.,The glittering Parthenon. These ample fields
5747,THE PRAIRIES.,"Nourished their harvests, here their herds were fed,"
5748,THE PRAIRIES.,"When haply by their stalls the bison lowed,"
5749,THE PRAIRIES.,And bowed his manèd shoulder to the yoke.
5750,THE PRAIRIES.,"All day this desert murmured with their toils,"
5751,THE PRAIRIES.,"Till twilight blushed, and lovers walked, and wooed"
5752,THE PRAIRIES.,"In a forgotten language, and old tunes,"
5753,THE PRAIRIES.,"From instruments of unremembered form,"
5754,THE PRAIRIES.,Gave the soft winds a voice. The red man came--
5755,THE PRAIRIES.,"The roaming hunter tribes, warlike and fierce,"
5756,THE PRAIRIES.,And the mound-builders vanished from the earth.
5757,THE PRAIRIES.,The solitude of centuries untold
5758,THE PRAIRIES.,Has settled where they dwelt. The prairie-wolf
5759,THE PRAIRIES.,"Hunts in their meadows, and his fresh-dug den"
5760,THE PRAIRIES.,Yawns by my path. The gopher mines the ground
5761,THE PRAIRIES.,Where stood their swarming cities. All is gone;
5762,THE PRAIRIES.,"All--save the piles of earth that hold their bones,"
5763,THE PRAIRIES.,"The platforms where they worshipped unknown gods,"
5764,THE PRAIRIES.,The barriers which they builded from the soil
5765,THE PRAIRIES.,To keep the foe at bay--till o'er the walls
5766,THE PRAIRIES.,"The wild beleaguerers broke, and, one by one,"
5767,THE PRAIRIES.,"The strongholds of the plain were forced, and heaped"
5768,THE PRAIRIES.,With corpses. The brown vultures of the wood
5769,THE PRAIRIES.,"Flocked to those vast uncovered sepulchres,"
5770,THE PRAIRIES.,And sat unscared and silent at their feast.
5771,THE PRAIRIES.,"Haply some solitary fugitive,"
5772,THE PRAIRIES.,"Lurking in marsh and forest, till the sense"
5773,THE PRAIRIES.,Of desolation and of fear became
5774,THE PRAIRIES.,"Bitterer than death, yielded himself to die."
5775,THE PRAIRIES.,Man's better nature triumphed then. Kind words
5776,THE PRAIRIES.,Welcomed and soothed him; the rude conquerors
5777,THE PRAIRIES.,Seated the captive with their chiefs; he chose
5778,THE PRAIRIES.,"A bride among their maidens, and at length"
5779,THE PRAIRIES.,Seemed to forget--yet ne'er forgot--the wife
5780,THE PRAIRIES.,"Of his first love, and her sweet little ones,"
5781,THE PRAIRIES.,"Butchered, amid their shrieks, with all his race."
5782,THE PRAIRIES.,
5783,THE PRAIRIES.,Thus change the forms of being. Thus arise
5784,THE PRAIRIES.,"Races of living things, glorious in strength,"
5785,THE PRAIRIES.,"And perish, as the quickening breath of God"
5786,THE PRAIRIES.,"Fills them, or is withdrawn. The red man, too,"
5787,THE PRAIRIES.,"Has left the blooming wilds he ranged so long,"
5788,THE PRAIRIES.,"And nearer to the Rocky Mountains, sought"
5789,THE PRAIRIES.,A wilder hunting-ground. The beaver builds
5790,THE PRAIRIES.,"No longer by these streams, but far away,"
5791,THE PRAIRIES.,On waters whose blue surface ne'er gave back
5792,THE PRAIRIES.,"The white man's face--among Missouri's springs,"
5793,THE PRAIRIES.,And pools whose issues swell the Oregon--
5794,THE PRAIRIES.,He rears his little Venice. In these plains
5795,THE PRAIRIES.,The bison feeds no more. Twice twenty leagues
5796,THE PRAIRIES.,"Beyond remotest smoke of hunter's camp,"
5797,THE PRAIRIES.,"Roams the majestic brute, in herds that shake"
5798,THE PRAIRIES.,The earth with thundering steps--yet here I meet
5799,THE PRAIRIES.,His ancient footprints stamped beside the pool.
5800,THE PRAIRIES.,
5801,THE PRAIRIES.,Still this great solitude is quick with life.
5802,THE PRAIRIES.,"Myriads of insects, gaudy as the flowers"
5803,THE PRAIRIES.,"They flutter over, gentle quadrupeds,"
5804,THE PRAIRIES.,"And birds, that scarce have learned the fear of man,"
5805,THE PRAIRIES.,"Are here, and sliding reptiles of the ground,"
5806,THE PRAIRIES.,Startlingly beautiful. The graceful deer
5807,THE PRAIRIES.,"Bounds to the wood at my approach. The bee,"
5808,THE PRAIRIES.,"A more adventurous colonist than man,"
5809,THE PRAIRIES.,"With whom he came across the eastern deep,"
5810,THE PRAIRIES.,"Fills the savannas with his murmurings,"
5811,THE PRAIRIES.,"And hides his sweets, as in the golden age,"
5812,THE PRAIRIES.,Within the hollow oak. I listen long
5813,THE PRAIRIES.,"To his domestic hum, and think I hear"
5814,THE PRAIRIES.,The sound of that advancing multitude
5815,THE PRAIRIES.,Which soon shall fill these deserts. From the ground
5816,THE PRAIRIES.,"Comes up the laugh of children, the soft voice"
5817,THE PRAIRIES.,"Of maidens, and the sweet and solemn hymn"
5818,THE PRAIRIES.,Of Sabbath worshippers. The low of herds
5819,THE PRAIRIES.,Blends with the rustling of the heavy grain
5820,THE PRAIRIES.,Over the dark brown furrows. All at once
5821,THE PRAIRIES.,"A fresher wind sweeps by, and breaks my dream,"
5822,THE PRAIRIES.,And I am in the wilderness alone.

7901,THE FOUNTAIN.,From the red mould and slimy roots of earth
7902,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Thou flashest in the sun. The mountain-air,"

7912,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Her leafy lances; the viburnum there,"
7913,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Paler of foliage, to the sun holds up"
7914,THE FOUNTAIN.,Her circlet of green berries. In and out

7917,THE FOUNTAIN.,
7918,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Not such thou wert of yore, ere yet the axe"
7919,THE FOUNTAIN.,Had smitten the old woods. Then hoary trunks

7922,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Grew soft, the maple burst into a flush"

7924,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Opened, in airs of June, her multitude"

7928,THE FOUNTAIN.,Frail wood-plants clustered round thy edge in spring;

7951,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Are heaved aloft, bows twang and arrows stream;"
7952,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Each makes a tree his shield, and every tree"
7953,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Sends forth its arrow. Fierce the fight and short,"
7954,THE FOUNTAIN.,As is the whirlwind. Soon the conquerors

7956,THE FOUNTAIN.,Mangled by tomahawks. The mighty woods

7961,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Figures of men that crouch and creep unheard,"

7965,THE FOUNTAIN.,"I look again--a hunter's lodge is built,"
7966,THE FOUNTAIN.,"With poles and boughs, beside thy crystal well,"
7967,THE FOUNTAIN.,"While the meek autumn stains the woods with gold,"
7968,THE FOUNTAIN.,And sheds his golden sunshine. To the door
7969,THE FOUNTAIN.,The red-man slowly drags the enormous bear
7970,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Slain in the chestnut-thicket, or flings down"
7971,THE FOUNTAIN.,The deer from his strong shoulders. Shaggy fells
7972,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Of wolf and cougar hang upon the walls,"
7973,THE FOUNTAIN.,"And loud the black-eyed Indian maidens laugh,"
7974,THE FOUNTAIN.,"That gather, from the rustling heaps of leaves,"
7975,THE FOUNTAIN.,"The hickory's white nuts, and the dark fruit"
7976,THE FOUNTAIN.,That falls from the gray butternut's long boughs.
7977,THE FOUNTAIN.,
7978,THE FOUNTAIN.,"So centuries passed by, and still the woods"
7979,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Blossomed in spring, and reddened when the year"
7980,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Grew chill, and glistened in the frozen rains"
7981,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Of winter, till the white man swung the axe"
7982,THE FOUNTAIN.,Beside thee--signal of a mighty change.
7983,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Then all around was heard the crash of trees,"
7984,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Trembling awhile and rushing to the ground,"
7985,THE FOUNTAIN.,"The low of ox, and shouts of men who fired"
7986,THE FOUNTAIN.,"The brushwood, or who tore the earth with ploughs;"
7987,THE FOUNTAIN.,"The grain sprang thick and tall, and hid in green"
7988,THE FOUNTAIN.,The blackened hill-side; ranks of spiky maize
7989,THE FOUNTAIN.,Rose like a host embattled; the buckwheat
7990,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Whitened broad acres, sweetening with its flowers"
7991,THE FOUNTAIN.,The August wind. White cottages were seen
7992,THE FOUNTAIN.,With rose-trees at the windows; barns from which
7993,THE FOUNTAIN.,Came loud and shrill the crowing of the cock;
7994,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Pastures where rolled and neighed the lordly horse,"
7995,THE FOUNTAIN.,And white flocks browsed and bleated. A rich turf
7996,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Of grasses brought from far o'ercrept thy bank,"
7997,THE FOUNTAIN.,Spotted with the white clover. Blue-eyed girls
7998,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Brought pails, and dipped them in thy crystal pool;"
7999,THE FOUNTAIN.,"And children, ruddy-cheeked and flaxen-haired,"
8000,THE FOUNTAIN.,Gathered the glistening cowslip from thy edge.
8001,THE FOUNTAIN.,
8002,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Since then, what steps have trod thy border! Here"
8003,THE FOUNTAIN.,"On thy green bank, the woodman of the swamp"
8004,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Has laid his axe, the reaper of the hill"
8005,THE FOUNTAIN.,"His sickle, as they stooped to taste thy stream."
8006,THE FOUNTAIN.,"The sportsman, tired with wandering in the still"
8007,THE FOUNTAIN.,"September noon, has bathed his heated brow"
8008,THE FOUNTAIN.,"In thy cool current. Shouting boys, let loose"
8009,THE FOUNTAIN.,"For a wild holiday, have quaintly shaped"
8010,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Into a cup the folded linden-leaf,"
8011,THE FOUNTAIN.,And dipped thy sliding crystal. From the wars
8012,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Returning, the plumed soldier by thy side"
8013,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Has sat, and mused how pleasant 'twere to dwell"
8014,THE FOUNTAIN.,"In such a spot, and be as free as thou,"
8015,THE FOUNTAIN.,And move for no man's bidding more. At eve
8016,THE FOUNTAIN.,"When thou wert crimson with the crimson sky,"
8017,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Lovers have gazed upon thee, and have thought"
8018,THE FOUNTAIN.,Their mingled lives should flow as peacefully
8019,THE FOUNTAIN.,"And brightly as thy waters. Here the sage,"
8020,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Gazing into thy self-replenished depth,"
8021,THE FOUNTAIN.,Has seen eternal order circumscribe
8022,THE FOUNTAIN.,"And bound the motions of eternal change,"
8023,THE FOUNTAIN.,And from the gushing of thy simple fount
8024,THE FOUNTAIN.,Has reasoned to the mighty universe.

8026,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Is there no other change for thee, that lurks"

8034,THE FOUNTAIN.,Alight to drink? Haply shall these green hills
8035,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Sink, with the lapse of years, into the gulf"
8036,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Of ocean waters, and thy source be lost"
8037,THE FOUNTAIN.,"Amidst the bitter brine? Or shall they rise,"

8064,II.,The valley woods lie prone beneath your flight.
8065,II.,The clouds before you shoot like eagles past;
8066,II.,The homes of men are rocking in your blast;

8161,THE OLD MAN'S COUNSEL.,
8162,THE OLD MAN'S COUNSEL.,"The sun of May was bright in middle heaven,"

8174,THE OLD MAN'S COUNSEL.,Gave a balsamic fragrance. In the fields

10013,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Oh River, gentle River! gliding on"
10014,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,In silence underneath the starless sky!
10015,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,Thine is a ministry that never rests
10016,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,Even while the living slumber. For a time
10017,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"The meddler, man, hath left the elements"
10018,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,In peace; the ploughman breaks the clods no more;
10019,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"The miner labors not, with steel and fire,"
10020,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"To rend the rock, and he that hews the stone,"
10021,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"And he that fells the forest, he that guides"

10025,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Thou pausest not in thine allotted task,"

10027,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,Thy wavelets rippling on the pebbly beach;
10028,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"I hear thy current stir the rustling sedge,"
10029,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,That skirts thy bed; thou intermittest not
10030,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Thine everlasting journey, drawing on"
10031,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,A silvery train from many a woodland spring
10032,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"And mountain-brook. The dweller by thy side,"
10033,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Who moored his little boat upon thy beach,"
10034,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,Though all the waters that upbore it then
10035,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Have slid away o'er night, shall find, at morn,"
10036,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,Thy channel filled with waters freshly drawn
10037,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"From distant cliffs, and hollows where the rill"
10038,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,Comes up amid the water-flags. All night
10039,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,Thou givest moisture to the thirsty roots
10040,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Of the lithe willow and o'erhanging plane,"
10041,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"And cherishest the herbage of thy bank,"
10042,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Spotted with little flowers, and sendest up"
10043,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Perpetually the vapors from thy face,"
10044,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"To steep the hills with dew, or darken heaven"
10045,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"With drifting clouds, that trail the shadowy shower."
10046,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,Oh River! darkling River! what a voice

10050,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,A weedy solitude by Tiber's stream!
10051,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"How many, at this hour, along thy course,"
10052,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Slumber to thine eternal murmurings,"
10053,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,That mingle with the utterance of their dreams!
10054,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,At dead of night the child awakes and hears
10055,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Thy soft, familiar dashings, and is soothed,"
10056,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,And sleeps again. An airy multitude
10057,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Of little echoes, all unheard by day,"
10058,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Faintly repeat, till morning, after thee,"
10059,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,The story of thine endless goings forth.
10060,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,Yet there are those who lie beside thy bed

10062,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Thy margin, and didst water the green fields;"
10063,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,And now there is no night so still that they
10064,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Can hear thy lapse; their slumbers, were thy voice"

10069,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Upon thy bosom, when the sun goes down."
10070,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Their memories are abroad, the memories"
10071,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Of those who last were gathered to the earth,"
10072,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Lingering within the homes in which they sat,"
10073,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Hovering above the paths in which they walked,"
10074,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,Haunting them like a presence. Even now
10075,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,They visit many a dreamer in the forms
10076,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"They walked in, ere at last they wore the shroud."
10077,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"And eyes there are which will not close to dream,"
10078,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"For weeping and for thinking of the grave,"
10079,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"The new-made grave, and the pale one within."
10080,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"These memories and these sorrows all shall fade,"
10081,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"And pass away, and fresher memories"
10082,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,And newer sorrows come and dwell awhile
10083,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Beside thy borders, and, in turn, depart."
10084,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"On glide thy waters, till at last they flow"
10085,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Beneath the windows of the populous town,"
10086,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"And all night long give back the gleam of lamps,"
10087,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,And glimmer with the trains of light that stream
10088,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,From halls where dancers whirl. A dimmer ray
10089,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,Touches thy surface from the silent room
10090,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"In which they tend the sick, or gather round"
10091,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"The dying; and a slender, steady beam"
10092,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Comes from the little chamber, in the roof"
10093,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Where, with a feverous crimson on her cheek,"
10094,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"The solitary damsel, dying, too,"
10095,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,Plies the quick needle till the stars grow pale.
10096,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"There, close beside the haunts of revel, stand"
10097,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"The blank, unlighted windows, where the poor,"
10098,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"In hunger and in darkness, wake till morn."
10099,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"There, drowsily, on the half-conscious ear"
10100,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Of the dull watchman, pacing on the wharf,"
10101,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,Falls the soft ripple of the waves that strike
10102,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,On the moored bark; but guiltier listeners
10103,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Are nigh, the prowlers of the night, who steal"
10104,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"From shadowy nook to shadowy nook, and start"
10105,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,If other sounds than thine are in the air.
10106,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Oh, glide away from those abodes, that bring"
10107,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,Pollution to thy channel and make foul
10108,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,Thy once clear current; summon thy quick waves
10109,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"And dimpling eddies; linger not, but haste,"
10110,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"With all thy waters, haste thee to the deep,"
10111,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,There to be tossed by shifting winds and rocked
10112,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,By that mysterious force which lives within
10113,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"The sea's immensity, and wields the weight"
10114,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"Of its abysses, swaying to and fro"
10115,THE NIGHT JOURNEY OF A RIVER.,"The billowy mass, until the stain, at length,"

11153,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"O Constellations of the early night,"
11154,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"That sparkled brighter as the twilight died,"
11155,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,And made the darkness glorious! I have seen
11156,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"Your rays grow dim upon the horizon's edge,"
11157,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,And sink behind the mountains. I have seen
11158,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"The great Orion, with his jewelled belt,"
11159,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"That large-limbed warrior of the skies, go down"
11160,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,Into the gloom. Beside him sank a crowd
11161,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,Of shining ones. I look in vain to find
11162,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"The group of sister-stars, which mothers love"
11163,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"To show their wondering babes, the gentle Seven."
11164,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,Along the desert space mine eyes in vain
11165,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,Seek the resplendent cressets which the Twins
11166,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,Uplifted in their ever-youthful hands.
11167,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,The streaming tresses of the Egyptian Queen
11168,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,Spangle the heavens no more. The Virgin trails
11169,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,No more her glittering garments through the blue.
11170,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"Gone! all are gone! and the forsaken Night,"
11171,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"With all her winds, in all her dreary wastes,"
11172,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,Sighs that they shine upon her face no more

11182,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"No train of flaming watchers, that shall mark"
11183,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,Their coming and farewell? O Sons of Light!
11184,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,Have ye then left me ere the dawn of day
11185,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,To grope along my journey sad and faint?
11186,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"Thus I complained, and from the darkness round"
11187,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"A voice replied--was it indeed a voice,"
11188,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,Or seeming accents of a waking dream
11189,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,Heard by the inner ear? But thus it said:
11190,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,O Traveller of the Night! thine eyes are dim
11191,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"With watching; and the mists, that chill the vale"
11192,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"Down which thy feet are passing, hide from view"
11193,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,The ever-burning stars. It is thy sight
11194,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"That is so dark, and not the heavens. Thine eyes,"
11195,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"Were they but clear, would see a fiery host"
11196,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"Above thee; Hercules, with flashing mace,"
11197,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"The Lyre with silver chords, the Swan uppoised"
11198,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"On gleaming wings, the Dolphin gliding on"
11199,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"With glistening scales, and that poetic steed,"
11200,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"With beamy mane, whose hoof struck out from earth"
11201,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"The fount of Hippocrene, and many more,"
11202,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"Fair clustered splendors, with whose rays the Night"
11203,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"Shall close her march in glory, ere she yield,"
11204,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"To the young Day, the great earth steeped in dew."
11205,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"So spake the monitor, and I perceived"

11207,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,Went backward to the vanished years and all
11208,THE CONSTELLATIONS.,"The good and great who came and passed with them,"

11290,SELLA.,
11291,SELLA.,
11292,SELLA.,Hear now a legend of the days of old--
11293,SELLA.,"The days when there were goodly marvels yet,"
11294,SELLA.,"When man to man gave willing faith, and loved"
11295,SELLA.,A tale the better that 'twas wild and strange.
11296,SELLA.,Beside a pleasant dwelling ran a brook
11297,SELLA.,"Scudding along a narrow channel, paved"
11298,SELLA.,With green and yellow pebbles; yet full clear
11299,SELLA.,"Its waters were, and colorless and cool,"
11300,SELLA.,As fresh from granite rocks. A maiden oft
11301,SELLA.,"Stood at the open window, leaning out,"
11302,SELLA.,"And listening to the sound the water made,"
11303,SELLA.,"A sweet, eternal murmur, still the same,"
11304,SELLA.,"And not the same; and oft, as spring came on,"
11305,SELLA.,"She gathered violets from its fresh moist bank,"
11306,SELLA.,"To place within her bower, and when the herbs"
11307,SELLA.,"Of summer drooped beneath the mid-day sun,"
11308,SELLA.,"She sat within the shade of a great rock,"
11309,SELLA.,Dreamily listening to the streamlet's song.
11310,SELLA.,Ripe were the maiden's years; her stature showed
11311,SELLA.,"Womanly beauty, and her clear, calm eye"
11312,SELLA.,"Was bright with venturous spirit, yet her face"
11313,SELLA.,"Was passionless, like those by sculptor graved"
11314,SELLA.,For niches in a temple. Lovers oft
11315,SELLA.,"Had wooed her, but she only laughed at love,"
11316,SELLA.,And wondered at the silly things they said.
11317,SELLA.,'Twas her delight to wander where wild-vines
11318,SELLA.,"O'erhang the river's brim, to climb the path"
11319,SELLA.,"Of woodland streamlet to its mountain-springs,"
11320,SELLA.,To sit by gleaming wells and mark below
11321,SELLA.,"The image of the rushes on its edge,"
11322,SELLA.,"And, deep beyond, the trailing clouds that slid"
11323,SELLA.,Across the fair blue space. No little fount
11324,SELLA.,"Stole forth from hanging rock, or in the side"
11325,SELLA.,"Of hollow dell, or under roots of oak;"
11326,SELLA.,"No rill came trickling, with a stripe of green,"
11327,SELLA.,"Down the bare hill, that to this maiden's eye"
11328,SELLA.,Was not familiar. Often did the banks
11329,SELLA.,Of river or of sylvan lakelet hear
11330,SELLA.,The dip of oars with which the maiden rowed
11331,SELLA.,"Her shallop, pushing ever from the prow"
11332,SELLA.,"A crowd of long, light ripples toward the shore."
11333,SELLA.,"Two brothers had the maiden, and she thought,"
11334,SELLA.,"Within herself: ""I would I were like them;"
11335,SELLA.,"For then I might go forth alone, to trace"
11336,SELLA.,"The mighty rivers downward to the sea,"
11337,SELLA.,"And upward to the brooks that, through the year,"
11338,SELLA.,Prattle to the cool valleys. I would know
11339,SELLA.,What races drink their waters; how their chiefs
11340,SELLA.,"Bear rule, and how men worship there, and how"
11341,SELLA.,"They build, and to what quaint device they frame,"
11342,SELLA.,"Where sea and river meet, their stately ships;"
11343,SELLA.,"What flowers are in their gardens, and what trees"
11344,SELLA.,Bear fruit within their orchards; in what garb
11345,SELLA.,"Their bowmen meet on holidays, and how"
11346,SELLA.,Their maidens bind the waist and braid the hair.
11347,SELLA.,"Here, on these hills, my father's house o'erlooks"
11348,SELLA.,"Broad pastures grazed by flocks and herds, but there"
11349,SELLA.,I hear they sprinkle the great plains with corn
11350,SELLA.,"And watch its springing up, and when the green"
11351,SELLA.,"Is changed to gold, they cut the stems and bring"
11352,SELLA.,"The harvest in, and give the nations bread."
11353,SELLA.,"And there they hew the quarry into shafts,"
11354,SELLA.,"And pile up glorious temples from the rock,"
11355,SELLA.,And chisel the rude stones to shapes of men.
11356,SELLA.,"All this I pine to see, and would have seen,"
11357,SELLA.,"But that I am a woman, long ago."""
11358,SELLA.,"Thus in her wanderings did the maiden dream,"
11359,SELLA.,"Until, at length, one morn in early spring,"
11360,SELLA.,"When all the glistening fields lay white with frost,"
11361,SELLA.,She came half breathless where her mother sat:
11362,SELLA.,"""See, mother dear,"" she said, ""what I have found,"
11363,SELLA.,"Upon our rivulet's bank; two slippers, white"
11364,SELLA.,"As the midwinter snow, and spangled o'er"
11365,SELLA.,"With twinkling points, like stars, and on the edge"
11366,SELLA.,"My name is wrought in silver; read, I pray,"
11367,SELLA.,"Sella, the name thy mother, now in heaven,"
11368,SELLA.,"Gave at my birth; and sure, they fit my feet!"""
11369,SELLA.,"""A dainty pair,"" the prudent matron said,"
11370,SELLA.,"""But thine they are not. We must lay them by"
11371,SELLA.,For those whose careless hands have left them here;
11372,SELLA.,Or haply they were placed beside the brook
11373,SELLA.,To be a snare. I cannot see thy name
11374,SELLA.,Upon the border--only characters
11375,SELLA.,"Of mystic look and dim are there, like signs"
11376,SELLA.,"Of some strange art; nay, daughter, wear them not."""
11377,SELLA.,Then Sella hung the slippers in the porch
11378,SELLA.,"Of that broad rustic lodge, and all who passed"
11379,SELLA.,"Admired their fair contexture, but none knew"
11380,SELLA.,"Who left them by the brook. And now, at length,"
11381,SELLA.,"May, with her flowers and singing birds, had gone,"
11382,SELLA.,And on bright streams and into deep wells shone
11383,SELLA.,"The high, midsummer sun. One day, at noon,"
11384,SELLA.,Sella was missed from the accustomed meal.
11385,SELLA.,"They sought her in her favorite haunts, they looked"
11386,SELLA.,"By the great rock and far along the stream,"
11387,SELLA.,And shouted in the sounding woods her name.
11388,SELLA.,"Night came, and forth the sorrowing household went"
11389,SELLA.,"With torches over the wide pasture-grounds,"
11390,SELLA.,"To pool and thicket, marsh and briery dell,"
11391,SELLA.,And solitary valley far away.
11392,SELLA.,"The morning came, and Sella was not found."
11393,SELLA.,"The sun climbed high; they sought her still; the noon,"
11394,SELLA.,"The hot and silent noon, heard Sella's name,"
11395,SELLA.,"Uttered with a despairing cry, to wastes"
11396,SELLA.,O'er which the eagle hovered. As the sun
11397,SELLA.,Stooped toward the amber west to bring the close
11398,SELLA.,"Of that sad second day, and, with red eyes,"
11399,SELLA.,"The mother sat within her home alone,"
11400,SELLA.,Sella was at her side. A shriek of joy
11401,SELLA.,"Broke the sad silence; glad, warm tears were shed,"
11402,SELLA.,"And words of gladness uttered. ""Oh, forgive,"""
11403,SELLA.,"The maiden said, ""that I could e'er forget"
11404,SELLA.,Thy wishes for a moment. I just tried
11405,SELLA.,"The slippers on, amazed to see them shaped"
11406,SELLA.,"So fairly to my feet, when, all at once,"
11407,SELLA.,I felt my steps upborne and hurried on
11408,SELLA.,"Almost as if with wings. A strange delight,"
11409,SELLA.,"Blent with a thrill of fear, o'ermastered me,"
11410,SELLA.,"And, ere I knew, my splashing steps were set"
11411,SELLA.,"Within the rivulet's pebbly bed, and I"
11412,SELLA.,Was rushing down the current. By my side
11413,SELLA.,Tripped one as beautiful as ever looked
11414,SELLA.,"From white clouds in a dream; and, as we ran,"
11415,SELLA.,She talked with musical voice and sweetly laughed.
11416,SELLA.,"Gayly we leaped the crag and swam the pool,"
11417,SELLA.,"And swept with dimpling eddies round the rock,"
11418,SELLA.,And glided between shady meadow-banks.
11419,SELLA.,"The streamlet, broadening as we went, became"
11420,SELLA.,"A swelling river, and we shot along"
11421,SELLA.,"By stately towns, and under leaning masts"
11422,SELLA.,"Of gallant barks, nor lingered by the shore"
11423,SELLA.,"Of blooming gardens; onward, onward still,"
11424,SELLA.,"The same strong impulse bore me, till, at last,"
11425,SELLA.,"We entered the great deep, and passed below"
11426,SELLA.,"His billows, into boundless spaces, lit"
11427,SELLA.,With a green sunshine. Here were mighty groves
11428,SELLA.,"Far down the ocean-valleys, and between"
11429,SELLA.,"Lay what might seem fair meadows, softly tinged"
11430,SELLA.,With orange and with crimson. Here arose
11431,SELLA.,"Tall stems, that, rooted in the depths below,"
11432,SELLA.,Swung idly with the motions of the sea;
11433,SELLA.,And here were shrubberies in whose mazy screen
11434,SELLA.,The creatures of the deep made haunt. My friend
11435,SELLA.,"Named the strange growths, the pretty coralline,"
11436,SELLA.,"The dulse with crimson leaves, and, streaming far,"
11437,SELLA.,Sea-thong and sea-lace. Here the tangle spread
11438,SELLA.,"Its broad, thick fronds, with pleasant bowers beneath;"
11439,SELLA.,"And oft we trod a waste of pearly sands,"
11440,SELLA.,"Spotted with rosy shells, and thence looked in"
11441,SELLA.,At caverns of the sea whose rock-roofed halls
11442,SELLA.,"Lay in blue twilight. As we moved along,"
11443,SELLA.,"The dwellers of the deep, in mighty herds,"
11444,SELLA.,"Passed by us, reverently they passed us by,"
11445,SELLA.,"Long trains of dolphins rolling through the brine,"
11446,SELLA.,"Huge whales, that drew the waters after them,"
11447,SELLA.,"A torrent-stream, and hideous hammer-sharks,"
11448,SELLA.,Chasing their prey. I shuddered as they came;
11449,SELLA.,"Gently they turned aside and gave us room."""
11450,SELLA.,"Hereat broke in the mother: ""Sella dear,"
11451,SELLA.,"This is a dream, the idlest, vainest dream."""
11452,SELLA.,"""Nay, mother, nay; behold this sea-green scarf,"
11453,SELLA.,Woven of such threads as never human hand
11454,SELLA.,Twined from the distaff. She who led my way
11455,SELLA.,"Through the great waters, bade me wear it home,"
11456,SELLA.,"A token that my tale is true. 'And keep,'"
11457,SELLA.,"She said, 'the slippers thou hast found, for thou,"
11458,SELLA.,"When shod with them, shalt be like one of us,"
11459,SELLA.,"With power to walk at will the ocean-floor,"
11460,SELLA.,"Among its monstrous creatures, unafraid,"
11461,SELLA.,And feel no longing for the air of heaven
11462,SELLA.,"To fill thy lungs, and send the warm, red blood"
11463,SELLA.,Along thy veins. But thou shalt pass the hours
11464,SELLA.,"In dances with the sea-nymphs, or go forth,"
11465,SELLA.,To look into the mysteries of the abyss
11466,SELLA.,Where never plummet reached. And thou shalt sleep
11467,SELLA.,Thy weariness away on downy banks
11468,SELLA.,"Of sea-moss, where the pulses of the tide"
11469,SELLA.,"Shall gently lift thy hair, or thou shalt float"
11470,SELLA.,On the soft currents that go forth and wind
11471,SELLA.,"From isle to isle, and wander through the sea.'"
11472,SELLA.,"""So spake my fellow-voyager, her words"
11473,SELLA.,"Sounding like wavelets on a summer shore,"
11474,SELLA.,"And then we stopped beside a hanging rock,"
11475,SELLA.,"With a smooth beach of white sands at its foot,"
11476,SELLA.,Where three fair creatures like herself were set
11477,SELLA.,"At their sea-banquet, crisp and juicy stalks,"
11478,SELLA.,"Culled from the ocean's meadows, and the sweet"
11479,SELLA.,"Midrib of pleasant leaves, and golden fruits"
11480,SELLA.,"Dropped from the trees that edge the southern isles,"
11481,SELLA.,And gathered on the waves. Kindly they prayed
11482,SELLA.,"That I would share their meal, and _I _partook"
11483,SELLA.,"With eager appetite, for long had been"
11484,SELLA.,"My journey, and I left the spot refreshed."
11485,SELLA.,"""And then we wandered off amid the groves"
11486,SELLA.,Of coral loftier than the growths of earth;
11487,SELLA.,"The mightiest cedar lifts no trunk like theirs,"
11488,SELLA.,"So huge, so high toward heaven, nor overhangs"
11489,SELLA.,Alleys and bowers so dim. We moved between
11490,SELLA.,"Pinnacles of black rock, which, from beneath,"
11491,SELLA.,"Molten by inner fires, so said my guide,"
11492,SELLA.,"Gushed long ago into the hissing brine,"
11493,SELLA.,"That quenched and hardened them, and now they stand"
11494,SELLA.,Motionless in the currents of the sea
11495,SELLA.,"That part and flow around them. As we went,"
11496,SELLA.,"We looked into the hollows of the abyss,"
11497,SELLA.,To which the never-resting waters sweep
11498,SELLA.,"The skeletons of sharks, the long white spines"
11499,SELLA.,"Of narwhal and of dolphin, bones of men"
11500,SELLA.,"Shipwrecked, and mighty ribs of foundered barks."
11501,SELLA.,"Down the blue pits we looked, and hastened on."
11502,SELLA.,"""But beautiful the fountains of the sea"
11503,SELLA.,Sprang upward from its bed: the silvery jets
11504,SELLA.,"Shot branching far into the azure brine,"
11505,SELLA.,"And where they mingled with it, the great deep"
11506,SELLA.,"Quivered and shook, as shakes the glimmering air"
11507,SELLA.,Ahove a furnace. So we wandered through
11508,SELLA.,"The mighty world of waters, till at length"
11509,SELLA.,"I wearied of its wonders, and my heart"
11510,SELLA.,Began to yearn for my dear mountain-home.
11511,SELLA.,I prayed my gentle guide to lead me back
11512,SELLA.,"To the upper air. 'A glorious realm,' I said,"
11513,SELLA.,'Is this thou openest to me; but I stray
11514,SELLA.,Bewildered in its vastness; these strange sights
11515,SELLA.,And this strange light oppress me. I must see
11516,SELLA.,"The faces that I love, or I shall die.'"
11517,SELLA.,"""She took my hand, and, darting through the waves"
11518,SELLA.,"Brought me to where the stream, by which we came,"
11519,SELLA.,Rushed into the main ocean. Then began
11520,SELLA.,A slower journey upward. Wearily
11521,SELLA.,"We breasted the strong current, climbing through"
11522,SELLA.,"The rapids, tossing high their foam. The night"
11523,SELLA.,"Came down, and in the clear depth of a pool,"
11524,SELLA.,"Edged with o'erhanging rock, we took our rest"
11525,SELLA.,"Till morning; and I slept, and dreamed of home"
11526,SELLA.,And thee. A pleasant sight the morning showed;
11527,SELLA.,"The green fields of this upper world, the herds"
11528,SELLA.,"That grazed the bank, the light on the red clouds,"
11529,SELLA.,"The trees, with all their host of trembling leaves,"
11530,SELLA.,Lifting and lowering to the restless wind
11531,SELLA.,"Their branches. As I woke, I saw them all"
11532,SELLA.,From the clear stream; yet strangely was my heart
11533,SELLA.,"Parted between the watery world and this,"
11534,SELLA.,"And as we journeyed upward, oft I thought"
11535,SELLA.,"Of marvels I had seen, and stopped and turned,"
11536,SELLA.,"And lingered, till I thought of thee again;"
11537,SELLA.,And then again I turned and clambered up
11538,SELLA.,"The rivulet's murmuring path, until we came"
11539,SELLA.,Beside the cottage-door. There tenderly
11540,SELLA.,"My fair conductor kissed me, and I saw"
11541,SELLA.,Her face no more. I took the slippers off.
11542,SELLA.,Oh! with what deep delight my lungs drew in
11543,SELLA.,"The air of heaven again, and with what joy"
11544,SELLA.,I felt my blood bound with its former glow;
11545,SELLA.,"And now I never leave thy side again!"""
11546,SELLA.,"So spoke the maiden Sella, with large tears"
11547,SELLA.,"Standing in her mild eyes, and in the porch"
11548,SELLA.,Replaced the slippers. Autumn came and went;
11549,SELLA.,The winter passed; another summer warmed
11550,SELLA.,The quiet pools; another autumn tinged
11551,SELLA.,"The grape with red, yet while it hung unplucked,"
11552,SELLA.,The mother ere her time was carried forth
11553,SELLA.,To sleep among the solitary hills.
11554,SELLA.,"A long, still sadness settled on that home"
11555,SELLA.,Among the mountains. The stern father there
11556,SELLA.,"Wept with his children, and grew soft of heart,"
11557,SELLA.,"And Sella, and the brothers twain, and one"
11558,SELLA.,"Younger than they, a sister fair and shy,"
11559,SELLA.,"Strewed the new grave with flowers, and round it set"
11560,SELLA.,Shrubs that all winter held their lively green.
11561,SELLA.,Time passed; the grief with which their hearts were wrung
11562,SELLA.,"Waned to a gentle sorrow. Sella, now,"
11563,SELLA.,Was often absent from the patriarch's board;
11564,SELLA.,The slippers hung no longer in the porch;
11565,SELLA.,And sometimes after summer nights her couch
11566,SELLA.,"Was found unpressed at dawn, and well they knew"
11567,SELLA.,That she was wandering with the race who make
11568,SELLA.,Their dwelling in the waters. Oft her looks
11569,SELLA.,"Fixed on blank space, and oft the ill-suited word"
11570,SELLA.,Told that her thoughts were far away. In vain
11571,SELLA.,Her brothers reasoned with her tenderly:
11572,SELLA.,"""Oh leave not thus thy kindred!"" so they prayed;"
11573,SELLA.,"""Dear Sella, now that she who gave us birth"
11574,SELLA.,"Is in her grave, oh go not hence, to seek"
11575,SELLA.,"Companions in that strange cold realm below,"
11576,SELLA.,"For which God made not us nor thee, but stay"
11577,SELLA.,"To be the grace and glory of our home."""
11578,SELLA.,"She looked at them with those mild eyes and wept,"
11579,SELLA.,"But said no word in answer, nor refrained"
11580,SELLA.,From those mysterious wanderings that filled
11581,SELLA.,Their loving hearts with a perpetual pain.
11582,SELLA.,"And now the younger sister, fair and shy,"
11583,SELLA.,"Had grown to early womanhood, and one"
11584,SELLA.,"Who loved her well had wooed her for his bride,"
11585,SELLA.,And she had named the wedding-day. The herd
11586,SELLA.,Had given its fatlings for the marriage-feast;
11587,SELLA.,The roadside garden and the secret glen
11588,SELLA.,Were rifled of their sweetest flowers to twine
11589,SELLA.,"The door-posts, and to lie among the locks"
11590,SELLA.,"Of maids, the wedding-guests, and from the boughs"
11591,SELLA.,Of mountain-orchards had the fairest fruit
11592,SELLA.,Been plucked to glisten in the canisters.
11593,SELLA.,"Then, trooping over hill and valley, came"
11594,SELLA.,"Matron and maid, grave men and smiling youths,"
11595,SELLA.,"Like swallows gathering for their autumn flight,"
11596,SELLA.,"In costumes of that simpler age they came,"
11597,SELLA.,"That gave the limbs large play, and wrapped the form"
11598,SELLA.,"In easy folds, yet bright with glowing hues"
11599,SELLA.,As suited holidays. All hastened on
11600,SELLA.,To that glad bridal. There already stood
11601,SELLA.,"The priest prepared to say the spousal rite,"
11602,SELLA.,"And there the harpers in due order sat,"
11603,SELLA.,"And there the singers. Sella, midst them all,"
11604,SELLA.,"Moved strangely and serenely beautiful,"
11605,SELLA.,"With clear blue eyes, fair locks, and brow and cheek"
11606,SELLA.,"Colorless as the lily of the lakes,"
11607,SELLA.,Yet moulded to such shape as artists give
11608,SELLA.,To beings of immortal youth. Her hands
11609,SELLA.,Had decked her sister for the bridal hour
11610,SELLA.,"With chosen flowers, and lawn whose delicate threads"
11611,SELLA.,Vied with the spider's spinning. There she stood
11612,SELLA.,With such a gentle pleasure in her looks
11613,SELLA.,As might beseem a river-nymph's soft eyes
11614,SELLA.,Gracing a bridal of the race whose flocks
11615,SELLA.,Were pastured on the borders of her stream.
11616,SELLA.,"She smiled, but from that calm sweet face the smile"
11617,SELLA.,Was soon to pass away. That very morn
11618,SELLA.,"The elder of the brothers, as he stood"
11619,SELLA.,"Upon the hillside, had beheld the maid,"
11620,SELLA.,"Emerging from the channel of the brook,"
11621,SELLA.,"With three fresh water-lilies in her hand,"
11622,SELLA.,"Wring dry her dripping locks, and in a cleft"
11623,SELLA.,"Of hanging rock, beside a screen of boughs,"
11624,SELLA.,Bestow the spangled slippers. None before
11625,SELLA.,Had known where Sella hid them. Then she laid
11626,SELLA.,"The light-brown tresses smooth, and in them twined"
11627,SELLA.,"The lily-buds, and hastily drew forth"
11628,SELLA.,And threw across her shoulders a light robe
11629,SELLA.,"Wrought for the bridal, and with bounding steps"
11630,SELLA.,Ran toward the lodge. The youth beheld and marked
11631,SELLA.,The spot and slowly followed from afar.
11632,SELLA.,Now had the marriage-rite been said; the bride
11633,SELLA.,Stood in the blush that from her burning cheek
11634,SELLA.,"Glowed down the alabaster neck, as morn"
11635,SELLA.,Crimsons the pearly heaven half-way to the west.
11636,SELLA.,At once the harpers struck their chords; a gush
11637,SELLA.,Of music broke upon the air; the youths
11638,SELLA.,All started to the dance. Among them moved
11639,SELLA.,The queenly Sella with a grace that seemed
11640,SELLA.,Caught from the swaying of the summer sea.
11641,SELLA.,"The young drew forth the elders to the dance,"
11642,SELLA.,"Who joined it half abashed, but when they felt"
11643,SELLA.,"The joyous music tingling in their veins,"
11644,SELLA.,"They called for quaint old measures, which they trod"
11645,SELLA.,"As gayly as in youth, and far abroad"
11646,SELLA.,Came through the open windows cheerful shouts
11647,SELLA.,And bursts of laughter. They who heard the sound
11648,SELLA.,"Upon the mountain footpaths paused and said,"
11649,SELLA.,"""A merry wedding."" Lovers stole away"
11650,SELLA.,That sunny afternoon to bowers that edged
11651,SELLA.,"The garden-walks, and what was whispered there"
11652,SELLA.,The lovers of these later times can guess.
11653,SELLA.,"Meanwhile the brothers, when the merry din"
11654,SELLA.,"Was loudest, stole to where the slippers lay,"
11655,SELLA.,"And took them thence, and followed down the brook"
11656,SELLA.,To where a little rapid rushed between
11657,SELLA.,"Its borders of smooth rock, and dropped them in."
11658,SELLA.,"The rivulet, as they touched its face, flung up"
11659,SELLA.,"Its small bright waves like hands, and seemed to take"
11660,SELLA.,The prize with eagerness and draw it down.
11661,SELLA.,"They, gleaming through the waters as they went,"
11662,SELLA.,"And striking with light sound the shining stones,"
11663,SELLA.,"Slid down the stream. The brothers looked and watched,"
11664,SELLA.,"And listened with full beating hearts, till now"
11665,SELLA.,"The sight and sound had passed, and silently"
11666,SELLA.,And half repentant hastened to the lodge.
11667,SELLA.,The sun was near his set; the music rang
11668,SELLA.,"Within the dwelling still, but the mirth waned;"
11669,SELLA.,For groups of guests were sauntering toward their homes
11670,SELLA.,"Across the fields, and far, on hillside paths,"
11671,SELLA.,Gleamed the white robes of maidens. Sella grew
11672,SELLA.,Weary of the long merriment; she thought
11673,SELLA.,"Of her still haunts beneath the soundless sea,"
11674,SELLA.,And all unseen withdrew and sought the cleft
11675,SELLA.,Where she had laid the slippers. They were gone!
11676,SELLA.,"She searched the brookside near, yet found them not."
11677,SELLA.,"Then her heart sank within her, and she ran"
11678,SELLA.,"Wildly from place to place, and once again"
11679,SELLA.,"She searched the secret cleft, and next she stooped"
11680,SELLA.,And with spread palms felt carefully beneath
11681,SELLA.,"The tufted herbs and bushes, and again,"
11682,SELLA.,"And yet again, she searched the rocky cleft."
11683,SELLA.,"""Who could have taken them?"" That question cleared"
11684,SELLA.,The mystery. She remembered suddenly
11685,SELLA.,"That when the dance was in its gayest whirl,"
11686,SELLA.,"Her brothers were not seen, and when, at length,"
11687,SELLA.,"They reappeared, the elder joined the sports"
11688,SELLA.,"With shouts of boisterous mirth, and from her eye"
11689,SELLA.,"The younger shrank in silence. ""Now, I know"
11690,SELLA.,"The guilty ones,"" she said, and left the spot,"
11691,SELLA.,And stood before the youths with such a look
11692,SELLA.,Of anguish and reproach that well they knew
11693,SELLA.,"Her thought, and almost wished the deed undone."
11694,SELLA.,"Frankly they owned the charge: ""And pardon us;"
11695,SELLA.,We did it all in love; we could not bear
11696,SELLA.,That the cold world of waters and the strange
11697,SELLA.,Beings that dwell within it should beguile
11698,SELLA.,"Our sister from us."" Then they told her all;"
11699,SELLA.,How they had seen her stealthily bestow
11700,SELLA.,"The slippers in the cleft, and how by stealth"
11701,SELLA.,"They took them thence and bore them down the brook,"
11702,SELLA.,"And dropped them in, and how the eager waves"
11703,SELLA.,Gathered and drew them down; but at that word
11704,SELLA.,The maiden shrieked--a broken-hearted shriek--
11705,SELLA.,And all who heard it shuddered and turned pale
11706,SELLA.,"At the despairing cry, and ""They are gone,"""
11707,SELLA.,"She said, ""gone--gone forever! Cruel ones!"
11708,SELLA.,'Tis you who shut me out eternally
11709,SELLA.,From that serener world which I had learned
11710,SELLA.,To love so well. Why took ye not my life?
11711,SELLA.,"Ye cannot know what ye have done!"" She spake"
11712,SELLA.,"And hurried to her chamber, and the guests"
11713,SELLA.,Who yet had lingered silently withdrew.
11714,SELLA.,"The brothers followed to the maiden's bower,"
11715,SELLA.,"But with a calm demeanor, as they came,"
11716,SELLA.,"She met them at the door. ""The wrong is great,"""
11717,SELLA.,"She said, ""that ye have done me, but no power"
11718,SELLA.,"Have ye to make it less, nor yet to soothe"
11719,SELLA.,"My sorrow; I shall bear it as I may,"
11720,SELLA.,The better for the hours that I have passed
11721,SELLA.,In the calm region of the middle sea.
11722,SELLA.,"Go, then. I need you not."" They, overawed,"
11723,SELLA.,Withdrew from that grave presence. Then her tears
11724,SELLA.,"Broke forth a flood, as when the August cloud,"
11725,SELLA.,"Darkening beside the mountain, suddenly"
11726,SELLA.,Melts into streams of rain. That weary night
11727,SELLA.,"She paced her chamber, murmuring as she walked,"
11728,SELLA.,"""O peaceful region of the middle sea!"
11729,SELLA.,"O azure bowers and grots, in which I loved"
11730,SELLA.,"To roam and rest! Am I to long for you,"
11731,SELLA.,"And think how strangely beautiful ye are,"
11732,SELLA.,"Yet never see you more? And dearer yet,"
11733,SELLA.,Ye gentle ones in whose sweet company
11734,SELLA.,"I trod the shelly pavements of the deep,"
11735,SELLA.,"And swam its currents, creatures with calm eyes"
11736,SELLA.,"Looking the tenderest love, and voices soft"
11737,SELLA.,"As ripple of light waves along the shore,"
11738,SELLA.,Uttering the tenderest words! Oh! ne'er again
11739,SELLA.,"Shall I, in your mild aspects, read the peace"
11740,SELLA.,"That dwells within, and vainly shall I pine"
11741,SELLA.,To hear your sweet low voices. Haply now
11742,SELLA.,"Ye miss me in your deep-sea home, and think"
11743,SELLA.,"Of me with pity, as of one condemned"
11744,SELLA.,"To haunt this upper world, with its harsh sounds"
11745,SELLA.,"And glaring lights, its withering heats, its frosts,"
11746,SELLA.,"Cruel and killing, its delirious strifes,"
11747,SELLA.,"And all its feverish passions, till I die."""
11748,SELLA.,"So mourned she the long night, and when the morn"
11749,SELLA.,"Brightened the mountains, from her lattice looked"
11750,SELLA.,The maiden on a world that was to her
11751,SELLA.,A desolate and dreary waste. That day
11752,SELLA.,She passed in wandering by the brook that oft
11753,SELLA.,"Had been her pathway to the sea, and still"
11754,SELLA.,"Seemed, with its cheerful murmur, to invite"
11755,SELLA.,"Her footsteps thither. ""Well mayst thou rejoice,"
11756,SELLA.,"Fortunate stream!"" she said, ""and dance along"
11757,SELLA.,"Thy bed, and make thy course one ceaseless strain"
11758,SELLA.,"Of music, for thou journeyest toward the deep,"
11759,SELLA.,"To which I shall return no more."" The night"
11760,SELLA.,"Brought her to her lone chamber, and she knelt"
11761,SELLA.,"And prayed, with many tears, to Him whose hand"
11762,SELLA.,Touches the wounded heart and it is healed.
11763,SELLA.,With prayer there came new thoughts and new desires.
11764,SELLA.,She asked for patience and a deeper love
11765,SELLA.,"For those with whom her lot was henceforth cast,"
11766,SELLA.,And that in acts of mercy she might lose
11767,SELLA.,The sense of her own sorrow. When she rose
11768,SELLA.,A weight was lifted from her heart. She sought
11769,SELLA.,"Her couch, and slept a long and peaceful sleep."
11770,SELLA.,At morn she woke to a new life. Her days
11771,SELLA.,Henceforth were given to quiet tasks of good
11772,SELLA.,"In the great world. Men hearkened to her words,"
11773,SELLA.,"And wondered at their wisdom and obeyed,"
11774,SELLA.,And saw how beautiful the law of love
11775,SELLA.,Can make the cares and toils of daily life.
11776,SELLA.,Still did she love to haunt the springs and brooks
11777,SELLA.,"As in her cheerful childhood, and she taught"
11778,SELLA.,The skill to pierce the soil and meet the veins
11779,SELLA.,"Of clear cold water winding underneath,"
11780,SELLA.,And call them forth to daylight. From afar
11781,SELLA.,She bade men bring the rivers on long rows
11782,SELLA.,"Of pillared arches to the sultry town,"
11783,SELLA.,And on the hot air of the summer fling
11784,SELLA.,The spray of dashing fountains. To relieve
11785,SELLA.,"Their weary hands, she showed them how to tame"
11786,SELLA.,"The rushing stream, and make him drive the wheel"
11787,SELLA.,That whirls the humming millstone and that wields
11788,SELLA.,"The ponderous sledge. The waters of the cloud,"
11789,SELLA.,"That drench the hillside in the time of rains,"
11790,SELLA.,"Were gathered, at her bidding, into pools,"
11791,SELLA.,"And in the months of drought led forth again,"
11792,SELLA.,"In glimmering rivulets, to refresh the vales,"
11793,SELLA.,Till the sky darkened with returning showers.
11794,SELLA.,"So passed her life, a long and blameless life,"
11795,SELLA.,And far and near her name was named with love
11796,SELLA.,"And reverence. Still she kept, as age came on,"
11797,SELLA.,Her stately presence; still her eyes looked forth
11798,SELLA.,From under their calm brows as brightly clear
11799,SELLA.,As the transparent wells by which she sat
11800,SELLA.,So oft in childhood. Still she kept her fair
11801,SELLA.,"Unwrinkled features, though her locks were white."
11802,SELLA.,"A hundred times had summer, since her birth,"
11803,SELLA.,"Opened the water-lily on the lakes,"
11804,SELLA.,"So old traditions tell, before she died."
11805,SELLA.,"A hundred cities mourned her, and her death"
11806,SELLA.,"Saddened the pastoral valleys. By the brook,"
11807,SELLA.,That bickering ran beside the cottage-door
11808,SELLA.,"Where she was born, they reared her monument."
11809,SELLA.,Ere long the current parted and flowed round
11810,SELLA.,"The marble base, forming a little isle,"
11811,SELLA.,"And there the flowers that love the running stream,"
11812,SELLA.,"Iris and orchis, and the cardinal-flower,"
11813,SELLA.,Crowded and hung caressingly around
11814,SELLA.,The stone engraved with Sella's honored name.

11829,TRANSLATED.,"The mightiest. Pallas, mindful of the past,"
11830,TRANSLATED.,"Spoke of Ulysses and his many woes,"
11831,TRANSLATED.,Grieved that he still was with the island-nymph.
11832,TRANSLATED.,"""Oh, father Jove, and all ye blessed ones"
11833,TRANSLATED.,"Who live forever! let not sceptred king,"
11834,TRANSLATED.,"Henceforth, be gracious, mild, and merciful,"
11835,TRANSLATED.,"And righteous; rather be he deaf to prayer,"
11836,TRANSLATED.,"And prone to deeds of wrong, since no one now"
11837,TRANSLATED.,Remembers the divine Ulysses more
11838,TRANSLATED.,"Among the people over whom he ruled,"
11839,TRANSLATED.,"Benignly, like a father. Still he lies,"
11840,TRANSLATED.,"Weighed down by many sorrows, in the isle"
11841,TRANSLATED.,"And dwelling of Calypso, who so long"
11842,TRANSLATED.,Constrains his stay. To his dear native land
11843,TRANSLATED.,"Depart he cannot; ship, arrayed with oars,"
11844,TRANSLATED.,"And seamen has he none, to bear him o'er"
11845,TRANSLATED.,"The breast of the broad ocean. Nay, even now,"
11846,TRANSLATED.,Against his well-beloved son a plot
11847,TRANSLATED.,"Is laid, to slay him as he journeys home"
11848,TRANSLATED.,"From Pylos the divine, and from the walls"
11849,TRANSLATED.,"Of famous Sparta, whither he had gone"
11850,TRANSLATED.,"To gather tidings of his father's fate."""
11851,TRANSLATED.,Then answered her the ruler of the storms:
11852,TRANSLATED.,"""My child, what words are these that pass thy lips?"
11853,TRANSLATED.,"Was not thy long-determined counsel this,"
11854,TRANSLATED.,"That, in good time, Ulysses should return,"
11855,TRANSLATED.,"To be avenged? Guide, then, Telemachus,"
11856,TRANSLATED.,"Wisely, for thou canst, that, all unharmed,"
11857,TRANSLATED.,"He reach his native land, and, in their barks,"
11858,TRANSLATED.,"Homeward the suitor-train retrace their way."""
11859,TRANSLATED.,"He spake, and turned to Hermes, his dear son:"
11860,TRANSLATED.,"""Hermes, for thou, in this, my messenger"
11861,TRANSLATED.,"Art, as in all things, to the bright-haired nymph"
11862,TRANSLATED.,"Make known my steadfast purpose, the return"
11863,TRANSLATED.,Of suffering Ulysses. Neither gods
11864,TRANSLATED.,"Nor men shall guide his voyage. On a raft,"
11865,TRANSLATED.,"Made firm with bands, he shall depart and reach,"
11866,TRANSLATED.,"After long hardships, on the twentieth day,"
11867,TRANSLATED.,"The fertile shore of Scheria, on whose isle"
11868,TRANSLATED.,"Dwell the Pheacians, kinsmen of the gods."
11869,TRANSLATED.,"They like a god shall honor him, and thence"
11870,TRANSLATED.,"Send him to his loved country in a ship,"
11871,TRANSLATED.,"With ample gifts of brass and gold, and store"
11872,TRANSLATED.,Of raiment--wealth like which he ne'er had brought
11873,TRANSLATED.,"From conquered Ilion, had he reached his home"
11874,TRANSLATED.,"Safely, with all his portion of the spoil."
11875,TRANSLATED.,"So is it preordained, that he behold"
11876,TRANSLATED.,"His friends again, and stand once more within"
11877,TRANSLATED.,"His high-roofed palace, on his native soil."""
11878,TRANSLATED.,"He spake; the herald Argicide obeyed,"
11879,TRANSLATED.,And hastily beneath his feet he bound
11880,TRANSLATED.,"The fair, ambrosial, golden sandals, worn"
11881,TRANSLATED.,"To bear him over ocean like the wind,"
11882,TRANSLATED.,"And o'er the boundless land. His wand he took,"
11883,TRANSLATED.,"Wherewith he softly seals the eyes of men,"
11884,TRANSLATED.,And opens them at will from sleep. With this
11885,TRANSLATED.,"In hand, the mighty Argos-queller flew,"
11886,TRANSLATED.,"And lighting on Pieria, from the sky"
11887,TRANSLATED.,"Plunged downward to the deep, and skimmed its face"
11888,TRANSLATED.,"Like hovering sea-mew, that on the broad gulfs"
11889,TRANSLATED.,"Of the unfruitful ocean seeks her prey,"
11890,TRANSLATED.,And often dips her pinions in the brine.
11891,TRANSLATED.,So Hermes flew along the waste of waves.
11892,TRANSLATED.,"But when he reached that island, far away,"
11893,TRANSLATED.,Forth from the dark-blue ocean-swell he stepped
11894,TRANSLATED.,"Upon the sea-beach, walking till he came"
11895,TRANSLATED.,To the vast cave in which the bright-haired nymph
11896,TRANSLATED.,Made her abode. He found the nymph within.
11897,TRANSLATED.,"A fire blazed brightly on the hearth, and far"
11898,TRANSLATED.,Was wafted o'er the isle the fragrant smoke
11899,TRANSLATED.,"Of cloven cedar, burning in the flame,"
11900,TRANSLATED.,"And cypress-wood. Meanwhile, in her recess,"
11901,TRANSLATED.,"She sweetly sang, as busily she threw"
11902,TRANSLATED.,The golden shuttle through the _web _she wove.
11903,TRANSLATED.,"And all about the grotto alders grew,"
11904,TRANSLATED.,"And poplars, and sweet-smelling cypresses,"
11905,TRANSLATED.,"In a green forest, high among whose boughs"
11906,TRANSLATED.,"Birds of broad wing, wood-owls and falcons, built"
11907,TRANSLATED.,"Their nests, and crows, with voices sounding far,"
11908,TRANSLATED.,All haunting for their food the ocean-side.
11909,TRANSLATED.,"A vine, with downy leaves and clustering grapes,"
11910,TRANSLATED.,Crept over all the cavern-rock. Four springs
11911,TRANSLATED.,"Poured forth their glittering waters in a row,"
11912,TRANSLATED.,And here and there went wandering side by side.
11913,TRANSLATED.,"Around were meadows of soft green, o'ergrown"
11914,TRANSLATED.,With violets and parsley. 'Twas a spot
11915,TRANSLATED.,"Where even an Immortal might, awhile,"
11916,TRANSLATED.,"Linger, and gaze with wonder and delight."
11917,TRANSLATED.,"The herald Argos-queller stood, and saw,"
11918,TRANSLATED.,And marvelled: but as soon as he had viewed
11919,TRANSLATED.,"The wonders of the place, he turned his steps,"
11920,TRANSLATED.,"Entering the broad-roofed cave. Calypso there,"
11921,TRANSLATED.,"The glorious goddess, saw him as he came,"
11922,TRANSLATED.,"And knew him, for the ever-living gods"
11923,TRANSLATED.,"Are to each other known, though one may dwell"
11924,TRANSLATED.,"Far from the rest. Ulysses, large of heart,"
11925,TRANSLATED.,"Was not within. Apart, upon the shore,"
11926,TRANSLATED.,"He sat and sorrowed, where he oft, in tears"
11927,TRANSLATED.,"And sighs and vain repinings, passed the hours,"
11928,TRANSLATED.,Gazing with wet eyes on the barren deep.
11929,TRANSLATED.,"Now, placing Hermes on a shining seat"
11930,TRANSLATED.,"Of state, Calypso, glorious goddess, said:"
11931,TRANSLATED.,"""Thou of the golden wand, revered and loved,"
11932,TRANSLATED.,"What, Hermes, brings thee hither? Passing few"
11933,TRANSLATED.,"Have been thy visits. Make thy pleasure known,"
11934,TRANSLATED.,"My heart enjoins me to obey, if aught"
11935,TRANSLATED.,That thou commandest be within my power.
11936,TRANSLATED.,"But first accept the offerings due a guest."""
11937,TRANSLATED.,"The goddess, speaking thus, before him placed"
11938,TRANSLATED.,"A table where the heaped ambrosia lay,"
11939,TRANSLATED.,And mingled the red nectar. Ate and drank
11940,TRANSLATED.,"The herald Argos-queller, and, refreshed,"
11941,TRANSLATED.,"Answered the nymph, and made his message known:"
11942,TRANSLATED.,"""Art thou a goddess, and dost ask of me,"
11943,TRANSLATED.,"A god, why came I hither? Yet, since thou"
11944,TRANSLATED.,"Requirest, I will truly tell the cause."
11945,TRANSLATED.,"I came unwillingly at Jove's command,"
11946,TRANSLATED.,"For who, of choice, would traverse the wide waste"
11947,TRANSLATED.,"Of the salt ocean, with no city near,"
11948,TRANSLATED.,Where men adore the gods with solemn rites
11949,TRANSLATED.,And chosen hecatombs? No god has power
11950,TRANSLATED.,To elude or to resist the purposes
11951,TRANSLATED.,"Of ægis-bearing Jove. With thee abides,"
11952,TRANSLATED.,"He bids me say, the most unhappy man"
11953,TRANSLATED.,Of all who round the city of Priam waged
11954,TRANSLATED.,"The battle through nine years, and, in the tenth,"
11955,TRANSLATED.,"Laying it waste, departed for their homes."
11956,TRANSLATED.,"But in their voyage, they provoked the wrath"
11957,TRANSLATED.,"Of Pallas, who called up the furious winds"
11958,TRANSLATED.,And angry waves against them. By his side
11959,TRANSLATED.,Sank all his gallant comrades in the deep.
11960,TRANSLATED.,Him did the winds and waves drive hither. Him
11961,TRANSLATED.,"Jove bids thee send away with speed, for here"
11962,TRANSLATED.,"He must not perish, far from all he loves."
11963,TRANSLATED.,So is it preordained that he behold
11964,TRANSLATED.,"His friends again, and stand once more within"
11965,TRANSLATED.,"His high-roofed palace, on his native soil."""
11966,TRANSLATED.,"He spoke; Calypso, glorious goddess, heard,"
11967,TRANSLATED.,"And shuddered, and with wingèd words replied:"
11968,TRANSLATED.,"""Ye are unjust, ye gods, and, envious far"
11969,TRANSLATED.,"Beyond all other beings, cannot bear"
11970,TRANSLATED.,That ever goddess openly should make
11971,TRANSLATED.,A mortal man her consort. Thus it was
11972,TRANSLATED.,"When once Aurora, rosy-fingered, took"
11973,TRANSLATED.,"Orion for her husband; ye were stung,"
11974,TRANSLATED.,"Amid your blissful lives, with envious hate,"
11975,TRANSLATED.,"Till chaste Diana, of the golden throne,"
11976,TRANSLATED.,"Smote him with silent arrows from her bow,"
11977,TRANSLATED.,"And slew him in Ortygia. Thus, again,"
11978,TRANSLATED.,"When bright-haired Ceres, swayed by her own heart,"
11979,TRANSLATED.,"In fields which bore three yearly harvests, met"
11980,TRANSLATED.,"Iasion as a lover, this was known"
11981,TRANSLATED.,"Ere long to Jupiter, who flung from high"
11982,TRANSLATED.,"A flaming thunderbolt, and laid him dead."
11983,TRANSLATED.,"And now ye envy me, that with me dwells"
11984,TRANSLATED.,"A mortal man. I saved him, as he clung,"
11985,TRANSLATED.,"Alone, upon his floating keel, for Jove"
11986,TRANSLATED.,"Had cloven, with a bolt of fire from heaven,"
11987,TRANSLATED.,"His galley in the midst of the black sea,"
11988,TRANSLATED.,And all his gallant comrades perished there.
11989,TRANSLATED.,"Him kindly I received; I cherished him,"
11990,TRANSLATED.,And promised him a life that ne'er should know
11991,TRANSLATED.,"Decay or death. But, since no god has power"
11992,TRANSLATED.,To elude or to withstand the purposes
11993,TRANSLATED.,"Of ægis-bearing Jove, let him depart,"
11994,TRANSLATED.,"If so the sovereign moves him and commands,"
11995,TRANSLATED.,Over the barren deep. I send him not;
11996,TRANSLATED.,"For neither ship arrayed with oars have I,"
11997,TRANSLATED.,"Nor seamen, o'er the boundless waste of waves"
11998,TRANSLATED.,"To bear him hence. My counsel I will give,"
11999,TRANSLATED.,"And nothing will I hide that he should know,"
12000,TRANSLATED.,"To place him safely on his native shore."""
12001,TRANSLATED.,The herald Argos-queller answered her:
12002,TRANSLATED.,"""Dismiss him thus, and bear in mind the wrath"
12003,TRANSLATED.,"Of Jove, lest it be kindled against thee."""
12004,TRANSLATED.,"Thus having said, the mighty Argicide"
12005,TRANSLATED.,"Departed, and the nymph, who now had heard"
12006,TRANSLATED.,"The doom of Jove, sought the great-hearted man,"
12007,TRANSLATED.,"Ulysses. Him she found beside the deep,"
12008,TRANSLATED.,"Seated alone, with eyes from which the tears"
12009,TRANSLATED.,"Were never dried, for now no more the nymph"
12010,TRANSLATED.,Delighted him; he wasted his sweet life
12011,TRANSLATED.,In yearning for his home. Night after night
12012,TRANSLATED.,"He slept constrained within the hollow cave,"
12013,TRANSLATED.,"The unwilling by the fond, and, day by day,"
12014,TRANSLATED.,"He sat upon the rocks that edged the shore,"
12015,TRANSLATED.,And in continual weeping and in sighs
12016,TRANSLATED.,"And vain repinings, wore the hours away,"
12017,TRANSLATED.,Gazing through tears upon the barren deep.
12018,TRANSLATED.,The glorious goddess stood by him and spoke:
12019,TRANSLATED.,"""Unhappy! sit no longer sorrowing here,"
12020,TRANSLATED.,Nor waste life thus. Lo! I most willingly
12021,TRANSLATED.,"Dismiss thee hence. Rise, hew down trees, and bind"
12022,TRANSLATED.,"Their trunks, with brazen clamps, into a raft,"
12023,TRANSLATED.,"And fasten planks above, a lofty floor,"
12024,TRANSLATED.,That it may bear thee o'er the dark-blue deep.
12025,TRANSLATED.,"Bread will I put on board, water, and wine,"
12026,TRANSLATED.,"Red wine, that cheers the heart, and wrap thee well"
12027,TRANSLATED.,"In garments, and send after thee the wind,"
12028,TRANSLATED.,That safely thou attain thy native shore;
12029,TRANSLATED.,"If so the gods permit thee, who abide"
12030,TRANSLATED.,"In the broad heaven above, and better know"
12031,TRANSLATED.,"By far than I, and far more wisely judge."""
12032,TRANSLATED.,"Ulysses, the great sufferer, as she spoke,"
12033,TRANSLATED.,"Shuddered, and thus with wingèd words replied:"
12034,TRANSLATED.,"""Some other purpose than to send me home"
12035,TRANSLATED.,"Is in thy heart, oh goddess, bidding me"
12036,TRANSLATED.,"To cross this frightful sea upon a raft,"
12037,TRANSLATED.,"This perilous sea, where never even ships"
12038,TRANSLATED.,"Pass with their rapid keels, though Jove bestow"
12039,TRANSLATED.,"The wind that glads the seamen. Nay, I climb"
12040,TRANSLATED.,"No raft, against thy wish, unless thou swear"
12041,TRANSLATED.,"The great oath of the gods, that thou, in this,"
12042,TRANSLATED.,"Dost meditate no other harm to me."""
12043,TRANSLATED.,"He spake; Calypso, glorious goddess, smiled,"
12044,TRANSLATED.,"And smoothed his forehead with her hand, and said:"
12045,TRANSLATED.,"""Perverse! and slow to see where guile is not!"
12046,TRANSLATED.,How could thy heart permit thee thus to speak?
12047,TRANSLATED.,"Now bear me witness, Earth, and ye broad Heavens"
12048,TRANSLATED.,"Above us, and ye waters of the Styx"
12049,TRANSLATED.,"That flow beneath us, mightiest oath of all,"
12050,TRANSLATED.,"And most revered by all the blessed gods,"
12051,TRANSLATED.,That I design no other harm to thee;
12052,TRANSLATED.,But that I plan for thee and counsel thee
12053,TRANSLATED.,What I would do were I in need like thine.
12054,TRANSLATED.,I bear a juster mind; my bosom holds
12055,TRANSLATED.,"A pitying heart, and not a heart of steel."""
12056,TRANSLATED.,"Thus having said, the glorious goddess moved"
12057,TRANSLATED.,"Away with hasty steps, and where she trod"
12058,TRANSLATED.,"He followed, till they reached the vaulted cave,"
12059,TRANSLATED.,The goddess and the hero. There he took
12060,TRANSLATED.,The seat whence Hermes had just risen. The nymph
12061,TRANSLATED.,Brought forth whatever mortals eat and drink
12062,TRANSLATED.,"To set before him. She, right opposite"
12063,TRANSLATED.,"To that of Ulysses, took her seat,"
12064,TRANSLATED.,"Ambrosia there her maidens laid, and there"
12065,TRANSLATED.,"Poured nectar. Both put forth their hands, and took"
12066,TRANSLATED.,"The ready viands, till at length the calls"
12067,TRANSLATED.,Of hunger and of thirst were satisfied;
12068,TRANSLATED.,"Calypso, glorious goddess, then began:"
12069,TRANSLATED.,"""Son of Laertes, man of many wiles,"
12070,TRANSLATED.,High-born Ulysses! Thus wilt thou depart
12071,TRANSLATED.,Home to thy native country? Then farewell;
12072,TRANSLATED.,"But, couldst thou know the sufferings Fate ordains"
12073,TRANSLATED.,"For thee ere yet thou landest on its shore,"
12074,TRANSLATED.,"Thou wouldst remain to keep this home with me,"
12075,TRANSLATED.,"And be immortal, strong as is thy wish"
12076,TRANSLATED.,"To see thy wife--a wish that, day by day,"
12077,TRANSLATED.,Possesses thee. I cannot deem myself
12078,TRANSLATED.,In form or face less beautiful than she;
12079,TRANSLATED.,For never with immortals can the race
12080,TRANSLATED.,"Of mortal dames in form or face compare."""
12081,TRANSLATED.,"Ulysses, the sagacious, answered her:"
12082,TRANSLATED.,"""Bear with me, gracious goddess; well I know"
12083,TRANSLATED.,All thou couldst say. The sage Penelope
12084,TRANSLATED.,In feature and in stature comes not nigh
12085,TRANSLATED.,"To thee; for she is mortal, deathless thou"
12086,TRANSLATED.,"And ever young; yet, day by day, I long"
12087,TRANSLATED.,"To be at home once more, and pine to see"
12088,TRANSLATED.,The hour of my return. Even though some god
12089,TRANSLATED.,"Smite me on the black ocean, I shall bear"
12090,TRANSLATED.,"The stroke, for in my bosom dwells a mind"
12091,TRANSLATED.,"Patient of suffering; much have I endured,"
12092,TRANSLATED.,"And much survived, in tempests on the deep,"
12093,TRANSLATED.,"And in the battle; let this happen too."""
12094,TRANSLATED.,"He spoke; the sun went down; the night came on,"
12095,TRANSLATED.,And now the twain withdrew to a recess
12096,TRANSLATED.,"Deep in the vaulted cave, where, side by side,"
12097,TRANSLATED.,"They took their rest. But when the child of dawn,"
12098,TRANSLATED.,"Aurora, rosy-fingered, looked abroad,"
12099,TRANSLATED.,Ulysses put his vest and mantle on;
12100,TRANSLATED.,"The nymph too, in a robe of silver white,"
12101,TRANSLATED.,"Ample, and delicate, and beautiful,"
12102,TRANSLATED.,"Arrayed herself, and round about her loins"
12103,TRANSLATED.,"Wound a fair golden girdle, drew a veil"
12104,TRANSLATED.,"Over her head, and planned to send away"
12105,TRANSLATED.,Magnanimous Ulysses. She bestowed
12106,TRANSLATED.,"A heavy axe, of steel, and double-edged,"
12107,TRANSLATED.,"Well fitted to the hand, the handle wrought"
12108,TRANSLATED.,"Of olive-wood, firm set and beautiful."
12109,TRANSLATED.,"A polished adze she gave him next, and led"
12110,TRANSLATED.,"The way to a far corner of the isle,"
12111,TRANSLATED.,"Where lofty trees, alders and poplars, stood,"
12112,TRANSLATED.,"And firs that reach the clouds, sapless and dry"
12113,TRANSLATED.,"Long since, and fitter thus to ride the waves."
12114,TRANSLATED.,"Then, having shown where grew the tallest trees,"
12115,TRANSLATED.,"Calypso, glorious goddess, sought her home."
12116,TRANSLATED.,"Trees then he felled, and soon the task was done."
12117,TRANSLATED.,"Twenty in all he brought to earth, and squared"
12118,TRANSLATED.,"Their trunks with the sharp steel, and carefully"
12119,TRANSLATED.,"He smoothed their sides, and wrought them by a line."
12120,TRANSLATED.,"Calypso, gracious goddess, having brought"
12121,TRANSLATED.,"Wimbles, he bored the beams, and, fitting them"
12122,TRANSLATED.,"Together, made them fast with nails and clamps."
12123,TRANSLATED.,"As when some builder, skillful in his art,"
12124,TRANSLATED.,"Frames, for a ship of burden, the broad keel,"
12125,TRANSLATED.,Such ample breadth Ulysses gave the raft.
12126,TRANSLATED.,"Upon the massy beams he reared a deck,"
12127,TRANSLATED.,And floored it with long planks from end to end.
12128,TRANSLATED.,"On this a mast he raised, and to the mast"
12129,TRANSLATED.,"Fitted a yard; he shaped a rudder next,"
12130,TRANSLATED.,"To guide the raft along her course, and round"
12131,TRANSLATED.,With woven work of willow-boughs he fenced
12132,TRANSLATED.,Her sides against the dashings of the sea.
12133,TRANSLATED.,"Calypso, gracious goddess, brought him store"
12134,TRANSLATED.,"Of canvas, which he fitly shaped to sails,"
12135,TRANSLATED.,"And, rigging her with cords, and ropes, and stays,"
12136,TRANSLATED.,Heaved her with levers into the great deep.
12137,TRANSLATED.,"'Twas the fourth day; his labors now were done,"
12138,TRANSLATED.,"And, on the fifth, the goddess from her isle"
12139,TRANSLATED.,"Dismissed him, newly from the bath, arrayed"
12140,TRANSLATED.,"In garments given by her, that shed perfumes."
12141,TRANSLATED.,"A skin of dark-red wine she put on board,"
12142,TRANSLATED.,"A larger one of water, and for food"
12143,TRANSLATED.,"A basket, stored with viands such as please"
12144,TRANSLATED.,The appetite. A friendly wind and soft
12145,TRANSLATED.,She sent before. The great Ulysses spread
12146,TRANSLATED.,"His canvas joyfully, to catch the breeze,"
12147,TRANSLATED.,"And sat and guided with nice care the helm,"
12148,TRANSLATED.,"Gazing with fixed eye on the Pleiades,"
12149,TRANSLATED.,"Boötes setting late, and the Great Bear,"
12150,TRANSLATED.,"By others called the Wain, which, wheeling round,"
12151,TRANSLATED.,"Looks ever toward Orion, and alone"
12152,TRANSLATED.,Dips not into the waters of the deep.
12153,TRANSLATED.,"For so Calypso, glorious goddess, bade"
12154,TRANSLATED.,"That, on his ocean journey, he should keep"
12155,TRANSLATED.,That constellation ever on his left.
12156,TRANSLATED.,"Now seventeen days were in the voyage past,"
12157,TRANSLATED.,"And on the eighteenth shadowy heights appeared,"
12158,TRANSLATED.,"The nearest point of the Pheacian land,"
12159,TRANSLATED.,Lying on the dark ocean like a shield.
12160,TRANSLATED.,"But mighty Neptune, coming from among"
12161,TRANSLATED.,"The Ethiopians, saw him. Far away"
12162,TRANSLATED.,"He saw, from mountain-heights of Solyma,"
12163,TRANSLATED.,"The voyager, and burned with fiercer wrath,"
12164,TRANSLATED.,"And shook his head, and said within himself:"
12165,TRANSLATED.,"""Strange! now I see the gods have new designs"
12166,TRANSLATED.,"For this Ulysses, formed while I was yet"
12167,TRANSLATED.,In Ethiopia. He draws near the land
12168,TRANSLATED.,"Of the Pheacians, where it is decreed"
12169,TRANSLATED.,He shall o'erpass the boundary of his woes;
12170,TRANSLATED.,"But first, I think, he will have much to bear."""
12171,TRANSLATED.,"He spoke, and round about him called the clouds"
12172,TRANSLATED.,"And roused the ocean, wielding in his hand"
12173,TRANSLATED.,"The trident, summoned all the hurricanes"
12174,TRANSLATED.,"Of all the winds, and covered earth and sky"
12175,TRANSLATED.,"At once with mists, while from above, the night"
12176,TRANSLATED.,Fell suddenly. The east wind and the south
12177,TRANSLATED.,"Rushed forth at once, with the strong-blowing west,"
12178,TRANSLATED.,And the clear north rolled up his mighty waves.
12179,TRANSLATED.,"Ulysses trembled in his knees and heart,"
12180,TRANSLATED.,"And thus to his great soul, lamenting, said:"
12181,TRANSLATED.,"""What will become of me? unhappy man!"
12182,TRANSLATED.,"I fear that all the goddess said was true,"
12183,TRANSLATED.,Foretelling what disasters should o'ertake
12184,TRANSLATED.,"My voyage, ere I reach my native land."
12185,TRANSLATED.,Now are her words fulfilled. Now Jupiter
12186,TRANSLATED.,Wraps the great heaven in clouds and stirs the deep
12187,TRANSLATED.,To tumult! Wilder grow the hurricanes
12188,TRANSLATED.,"Of all the winds, and now my fate is sure."
12189,TRANSLATED.,"Thrice happy, four times happy they, who fell"
12190,TRANSLATED.,"On Troy's wide field, warring for Atreus' sons:"
12191,TRANSLATED.,"O, had I met my fate and perished there,"
12192,TRANSLATED.,"That very day on which the Trojan host,"
12193,TRANSLATED.,"Around the dead Achilles, hurled at me"
12194,TRANSLATED.,Their brazen javelins! I had then received
12195,TRANSLATED.,Due burial and great glory with the Greeks;
12196,TRANSLATED.,"Now must I die a miserable death."""
12197,TRANSLATED.,"As thus he spoke, upon him, from on high,"
12198,TRANSLATED.,A huge and frightful billow broke; it whirled
12199,TRANSLATED.,"The raft around, and far from it he fell."
12200,TRANSLATED.,His hands let go the rudder; a fierce rush
12201,TRANSLATED.,Of all the winds together snapped in twain
12202,TRANSLATED.,The mast; far off the yard and canvas flew
12203,TRANSLATED.,Into the deep; the billow held him long
12204,TRANSLATED.,"Beneath the waters, and he strove in vain"
12205,TRANSLATED.,Quickly to rise to air from that huge swell
12206,TRANSLATED.,"Of ocean, for the garments weighed him down"
12207,TRANSLATED.,"Which fair Calypso gave him. But, at length,"
12208,TRANSLATED.,"Emerging, he rejected from his throat"
12209,TRANSLATED.,The bitter brine that down his forehead streamed.
12210,TRANSLATED.,"Even then, though hopeless with dismay, his thought"
12211,TRANSLATED.,"Was on the raft, and, struggling through the waves,"
12212,TRANSLATED.,"He seized it, sprang on board, and seated there"
12213,TRANSLATED.,Escaped the threatened death. Still to and fro
12214,TRANSLATED.,The rolling billows drove it. As the wind
12215,TRANSLATED.,"In autumn sweeps the thistles o'er the field,"
12216,TRANSLATED.,"Clinging together, so the blasts of heaven"
12217,TRANSLATED.,Hither and thither drove it o'er the sea.
12218,TRANSLATED.,And now the south wind flung it to the north
12219,TRANSLATED.,To buffet; now the east wind to the west.
12220,TRANSLATED.,"Ino Leucothea saw him clinging there,"
12221,TRANSLATED.,"The delicate-footed child of Cadmus, once"
12222,TRANSLATED.,"A mortal, speaking with a mortal voice;"
12223,TRANSLATED.,"Though now within the ocean-gulfs, she shares"
12224,TRANSLATED.,The honors of the gods. With pity she
12225,TRANSLATED.,"Beheld Ulysses struggling thus distressed,"
12226,TRANSLATED.,"And, rising from the abyss below, in form"
12227,TRANSLATED.,"A cormorant, the sea-nymph took her perch"
12228,TRANSLATED.,"On the well-banded raft, and thus she said:"
12229,TRANSLATED.,"""Ah, luckless man, how hast thou angered thus"
12230,TRANSLATED.,"Earth-shaking Neptune, that he visits thee"
12231,TRANSLATED.,"With these disasters? Yet he cannot take,"
12232,TRANSLATED.,"Although he seek it earnestly, thy life."
12233,TRANSLATED.,"Now do my bidding, for thou seemest wise."
12234,TRANSLATED.,"Laying aside thy garments, let the raft"
12235,TRANSLATED.,"Drift with the winds, while thou, by strength of arm,"
12236,TRANSLATED.,Makest thy way in swimming to the land
12237,TRANSLATED.,"Of the Pheacians, where thy safety lies."
12238,TRANSLATED.,Receive this veil and bind its heavenly woof
12239,TRANSLATED.,"Beneath thy breast, and have no further fear"
12240,TRANSLATED.,"Of hardship or of danger. But, as soon"
12241,TRANSLATED.,"As thou shalt touch the island, take it off,"
12242,TRANSLATED.,"And turn away thy face, and fling it far"
12243,TRANSLATED.,"From where thou standest, into the black deep."""
12244,TRANSLATED.,"The goddess gave the veil as thus she spoke,"
12245,TRANSLATED.,"And to the tossing deep went down, in form"
12246,TRANSLATED.,A cormorant; the black wave covered her.
12247,TRANSLATED.,"But still Ulysses, mighty sufferer,"
12248,TRANSLATED.,"Pondered, and thus to his great soul he said:"
12249,TRANSLATED.,"""Ah me! perhaps some god is planning here"
12250,TRANSLATED.,"Some other fraud against me, bidding me"
12251,TRANSLATED.,"Forsake my raft. I will not yet obey,"
12252,TRANSLATED.,For still far off I see the land in which
12253,TRANSLATED.,"'Tis said my refuge lies. This will I do,"
12254,TRANSLATED.,For this seems wisest. While the fastenings last
12255,TRANSLATED.,"That hold these timbers, I will keep my place"
12256,TRANSLATED.,And bide the tempest here. But when the waves
12257,TRANSLATED.,"Shall dash my raft in pieces, I will swim,"
12258,TRANSLATED.,"For nothing better will remain to do."""
12259,TRANSLATED.,"As he revolved this purpose in his mind,"
12260,TRANSLATED.,"Earth-shaking Neptune sent a mighty wave,"
12261,TRANSLATED.,"Horrid, and huge, and high, and where he sat"
12262,TRANSLATED.,It smote him. As a violent wind uplifts
12263,TRANSLATED.,"The dry chaff heaped upon a threshing-floor,"
12264,TRANSLATED.,"And sends it scattered through the air abroad,"
12265,TRANSLATED.,So did that wave fling loose the ponderous beams.
12266,TRANSLATED.,"To one of these, Ulysses, clinging fast,"
12267,TRANSLATED.,"Bestrode it, like a horseman on his steed;"
12268,TRANSLATED.,"And now he took the garments off, bestowed"
12269,TRANSLATED.,"By fair Calypso, binding round his breast"
12270,TRANSLATED.,"The veil, and forward plunged into the deep,"
12271,TRANSLATED.,"With palms outspread, prepared to swim. Meanwhile,"
12272,TRANSLATED.,"Neptune beheld him, Neptune, mighty king,"
12273,TRANSLATED.,"And shook his head, and said within himself:"
12274,TRANSLATED.,"""Go thus, and, laden with mischances, roam"
12275,TRANSLATED.,"The waters, till thou come among the race"
12276,TRANSLATED.,Cherished by Jupiter; but well I deem
12277,TRANSLATED.,"Thou wilt not find thy share of suffering light."""
12278,TRANSLATED.,"Thus having spoke, he urged his coursers on,"
12279,TRANSLATED.,"With their fair-flowing manes, until he came"
12280,TRANSLATED.,"To Ægæ, where his glorious palace stands."
12281,TRANSLATED.,"But Pallas, child of Jove, had other thoughts."
12282,TRANSLATED.,"She stayed the course of every wind beside,"
12283,TRANSLATED.,"And bade them rest, and lulled them into sleep,"
12284,TRANSLATED.,"But summoned the swift north to break the waves,"
12285,TRANSLATED.,"That so Ulysses, the high-born, escaped"
12286,TRANSLATED.,"From death and from the fates, might be the guest"
12287,TRANSLATED.,"Of the Pheacians, men who love the sea."
12288,TRANSLATED.,"Two days and nights, among the mighty waves"
12289,TRANSLATED.,"He floated, oft his heart foreboding death,"
12290,TRANSLATED.,But when the bright-haired Eos had fulfilled
12291,TRANSLATED.,"The third day's course, and all the winds were laid,"
12292,TRANSLATED.,"And calm was on the watery waste, he saw"
12293,TRANSLATED.,"The land was near, as, lifted on the crest"
12294,TRANSLATED.,"Of a huge swell, he looked with sharpened sight;"
12295,TRANSLATED.,And as a father's life preserved makes glad
12296,TRANSLATED.,"His children's hearts, when long time he has lain"
12297,TRANSLATED.,"Sick, wrung with pain, and wasting by the power"
12298,TRANSLATED.,"Of some malignant genius, till, at length,"
12299,TRANSLATED.,The gracious gods bestow a welcome cure;
12300,TRANSLATED.,So welcome to Ulysses was the sight
12301,TRANSLATED.,Of woods and fields. By swimming on he thought
12302,TRANSLATED.,"To climb and tread the shore, but when he drew"
12303,TRANSLATED.,So near that one who shouted could be heard
12304,TRANSLATED.,"From land, the sound of ocean on the rocks"
12305,TRANSLATED.,"Came to his ear, for there huge breakers roared"
12306,TRANSLATED.,"And spouted fearfully, and all around"
12307,TRANSLATED.,Was covered with the sea-foam. Haven here
12308,TRANSLATED.,"Was none for ships, nor sheltering creek, but shores"
12309,TRANSLATED.,"Beetling from high, and crags and walls of rock."
12310,TRANSLATED.,"Ulysses trembled both in knees and heart,"
12311,TRANSLATED.,"And thus, to his great soul, lamenting, said:"
12312,TRANSLATED.,"""Now woe is me! as soon as Jove has shown"
12313,TRANSLATED.,"What I had little hoped to see, the land,"
12314,TRANSLATED.,"And I through all these waves have ploughed my way,"
12315,TRANSLATED.,I find no issue from the hoary deep.
12316,TRANSLATED.,"For sharp rocks border it, and all around"
12317,TRANSLATED.,Roar the wild surges; slippery cliffs arise
12318,TRANSLATED.,"Close to deep gulfs, and footing there is none,"
12319,TRANSLATED.,Where I might plant my steps and thus escape.
12320,TRANSLATED.,All effort now were fruitless to resist
12321,TRANSLATED.,The mighty billow hurrying me away
12322,TRANSLATED.,To dash me on the pointed rocks. If yet
12323,TRANSLATED.,"I strive, by swimming further, to descry"
12324,TRANSLATED.,"Some sloping shore or harbor of the isle,"
12325,TRANSLATED.,"I fear the tempest, lest it hurl me back,"
12326,TRANSLATED.,"Heavily groaning, to the fishy deep,"
12327,TRANSLATED.,"Or huge sea-monster, from the multitude"
12328,TRANSLATED.,"Which sovereign Amphitrite feeds, be sent"
12329,TRANSLATED.,"Against me by some god, for well I know"
12330,TRANSLATED.,"The power who shakes the shores is wroth with me."""
12331,TRANSLATED.,"While he revolved these doubts within his mind,"
12332,TRANSLATED.,A huge wave hurled him toward the rugged coast.
12333,TRANSLATED.,"Then had his limbs been flayed, and all his bones"
12334,TRANSLATED.,"Broken at once, had not the blue-eyed maid,"
12335,TRANSLATED.,"Minerva, prompted him. Borne toward the rock,"
12336,TRANSLATED.,"He clutched it instantly, with both his hands,"
12337,TRANSLATED.,"And panting clung till that huge wave rolled by,"
12338,TRANSLATED.,"And so escaped its fury. But it came,"
12339,TRANSLATED.,"And smote him once again, and flung him far"
12340,TRANSLATED.,"Seaward. As to the claws of polypus,"
12341,TRANSLATED.,"Plucked from its bed, the pebbles thickly cling,"
12342,TRANSLATED.,"So flakes of skin, from off his powerful hands,"
12343,TRANSLATED.,Were left upon the rock. The mighty surge
12344,TRANSLATED.,"O'erwhelmed him; he had perished ere his time,"
12345,TRANSLATED.,"Hapless Ulysses, but the blue-eyed maid,"
12346,TRANSLATED.,"Pallas, informed his mind with forecast. Straight"
12347,TRANSLATED.,"Emerging from the wave that shoreward rolled,"
12348,TRANSLATED.,"He swam along the coast and eyed it well,"
12349,TRANSLATED.,In hope of sloping beach or sheltered creek.
12350,TRANSLATED.,"But when, in swimming, he had reached the mouth"
12351,TRANSLATED.,"Of a soft-flowing river, here appeared"
12352,TRANSLATED.,"The spot he wished for, smooth, without a rock,"
12353,TRANSLATED.,And here was shelter from the wind. He felt
12354,TRANSLATED.,"The current's flow, and thus devoutly prayed:"
12355,TRANSLATED.,"""Hear me, oh sovereign power, whoe'er thou art!"
12356,TRANSLATED.,"To thee, the long-desired, I come. I seek"
12357,TRANSLATED.,Escape from Neptune's threatenings on the sea.
12358,TRANSLATED.,The deathless gods respect the prayer of him
12359,TRANSLATED.,"Who looks to them for help, a fugitive,"
12360,TRANSLATED.,"As I am now, when to thy stream I come,"
12361,TRANSLATED.,"And to thy knees, from many a hardship past,"
12362,TRANSLATED.,"Oh thou that here art ruler, I declare"
12363,TRANSLATED.,"Myself thy suppliant; be thou merciful."""
12364,TRANSLATED.,"He spoke; the river stayed his current, checked"
12365,TRANSLATED.,"The billows, smoothed them, to a calm, and gave"
12366,TRANSLATED.,The swimmer a safe landing at his mouth.
12367,TRANSLATED.,"Then dropped his knees and sinewy arms, at once"
12368,TRANSLATED.,"Unstrung, for faint with struggling was his heart."
12369,TRANSLATED.,His body was all swoln; the brine gushed forth
12370,TRANSLATED.,"From mouth and nostrils; all unnerved he lay,"
12371,TRANSLATED.,Breathless and speechless; utter weariness
12372,TRANSLATED.,"O'ermastered him. But when he breathed again,"
12373,TRANSLATED.,"And his flown senses had returned, he loosed"
12374,TRANSLATED.,"The veil that Ino gave him from his breast,"
12375,TRANSLATED.,And to the salt flood cast it. A great wave
12376,TRANSLATED.,Bore it far down the stream; the goddess there
12377,TRANSLATED.,"In her own hands received it. He, meanwhile,"
12378,TRANSLATED.,"Withdrawing from the brink, lay down among"
12379,TRANSLATED.,"The reeds, and kissed the harvest-bearing earth,"
12380,TRANSLATED.,"And thus to his great soul, lamenting, said:"
12381,TRANSLATED.,"""Ah me! what must I suffer more! what yet"
12382,TRANSLATED.,"Will happen to me? If, by the river's side,"
12383,TRANSLATED.,"I pass the unfriendly watches of the night,"
12384,TRANSLATED.,The cruel cold and dews that steep the bank
12385,TRANSLATED.,"May, in this weakness, end me utterly,"
12386,TRANSLATED.,For chilly blows the river-air at dawn.
12387,TRANSLATED.,"But should I climb this hill, to sleep within"
12388,TRANSLATED.,"The shadowy wood, among their shrubs, if cold"
12389,TRANSLATED.,"And weariness allow me, then I fear,"
12390,TRANSLATED.,"That, while the pleasant slumbers o'er me steal,"
12391,TRANSLATED.,"I may become the prey of savage beasts."""
12392,TRANSLATED.,"Yet, as he longer pondered, this seemed best."
12393,TRANSLATED.,"He rose and sought the wood, and found it near"
12394,TRANSLATED.,"The water, on a height, o'erlooking far"
12395,TRANSLATED.,"The region round. Between two shrubs, that sprung"
12396,TRANSLATED.,"Both from one spot, he entered--olive-trees,"
12397,TRANSLATED.,"One wild, one fruitful. The damp-blowing wind"
12398,TRANSLATED.,Ne'er pierced their covert; never blazing sun
12399,TRANSLATED.,"Darted his beams within, nor pelting shower"
12400,TRANSLATED.,"Beat through, so closely intertwined they grew."
12401,TRANSLATED.,"Here entering, Ulysses heaped a bed"
12402,TRANSLATED.,Of leaves with his own hands; he made it broad
12403,TRANSLATED.,"And high, for thick the leaves had fallen around."
12404,TRANSLATED.,"Two men and three, in that abundant store,"
12405,TRANSLATED.,"Might bide the winter-storm, though keen the cold."
12406,TRANSLATED.,"Ulysses, the great sufferer, on his couch"
12407,TRANSLATED.,"Looked and rejoiced, and placed himself within,"
12408,TRANSLATED.,And heaped the leaves high o'er him and around.
12409,TRANSLATED.,"As one who, dwelling in the distant fields,"
12410,TRANSLATED.,"Without a neighbor near him, hides a brand"
12411,TRANSLATED.,"In the dark ashes, keeping carefully"
12412,TRANSLATED.,"The seeds of fire alive, lest he, perforce,"
12413,TRANSLATED.,To light his hearth must bring them from afar;
12414,TRANSLATED.,"So did Ulysses, in that pile of leaves,"
12415,TRANSLATED.,"Bury himself, while Pallas o'er his eyes"
12416,TRANSLATED.,"Poured sleep and closed his lids, that he might take,"
12417,TRANSLATED.,"After his painful toils, the fitting rest."

12444,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Was yet an acorn, on a mountain's side"

12467,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Or where the rivulets of Ararat

12469,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"So high, that, on its top, the winter-snow"
12470,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Was never melted, and the cottagers"
12471,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Among the summer-blossoms, far below,"
12472,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Saw its white peaks in August from their door.
12473,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"One little maiden, in that cottage-home,"

12483,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Now you must know that, in those early times,"
12484,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"When autumn days grew pale, there came a troop"

12486,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"With trailing garments through the air they came,"

12489,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And edged the brooks with glistening parapets,"
12490,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And built it crystal bridges, touched the pool,"

12492,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"They shook from their full laps the soft, light snow,"

12496,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And fair, bright locks, and voices like the sound"

12502,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And, of the light wreaths of his smoking breath,"
12503,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Wove a white fringe for his brown beard, and laughed"

12508,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"To them the sun's warm beams were shafts of fire,"
12509,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,And the soft south-wind was the wind of death.

12512,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Or scampered upward to the mountain's top,"

12533,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,And climbed the rounded snow-swells firm with frost
12534,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Beneath her feet, and slid, with balancing arms,"
12535,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Into the hollows. Once, as up a drift"
12536,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"She slowly rose, before her, in the way,"
12537,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"She saw a little creature, lily-cheeked,"
12538,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"With flowing flaxen locks, and faint blue eyes,"
12539,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"That gleamed like ice, and robe that only seemed"
12540,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Of a more shadowy whiteness than her cheek.
12541,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,On a smooth bank she sat.
12542,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,_Alice._--She must have been
12543,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,One of your Little People of the Snow.
12544,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"_Uncle John._--She was so, and, as Eva now drew near,"
12545,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,The tiny creature bounded from her seat;
12546,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"""And come,"" she said, ""my pretty friend; to-day"
12547,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"We will be playmates. I have watched thee long,"
12548,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And seen how well thou lov'st to walk these drifts,"
12549,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And scoop their fair sides into little cells,"
12550,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And carve them with quaint figures, huge-limbed men,"
12551,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Lions, and griffins. We will have, to-day,"
12552,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"A merry ramble over these bright fields,"
12553,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And thou shalt see what thou hast never seen."""
12554,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"On went the pair, until they reached the bound"
12555,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Where the great linden stood, set deep in snow,"
12556,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Up to the lower branches. ""Here we stop,"""
12557,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Said Eva, ""for my mother has my word"
12558,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"That I will go no farther than this tree."""
12559,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Then the snow-maiden laughed: ""And what is this?"
12560,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"This fear of the pure snow, the innocent snow,"
12561,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,That never harmed aught living? Thou mayst roam
12562,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"For leagues beyond this garden, and return"
12563,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"In safety; here the grim wolf never prowls,"
12564,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,And here the eagle of our mountain-crags
12565,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Preys not in winter. I will show the way,"
12566,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And bring thee safely home. Thy mother, sure,"
12567,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Counselled thee thus because thou hadst no guide."""
12568,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,By such smooth words was Eva won to break
12569,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Her promise, and went on with her new friend,"
12570,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Over the glistening snow and down a bank
12571,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Where a white shelf, wrought by the eddying wind,"
12572,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Like to a billow's crest in the great sea,"
12573,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Curtained an opening. ""Look, we enter here."""
12574,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And straight, beneath the fair o'erhanging fold,"
12575,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Entered the little pair that hill of snow,"
12576,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Walking along a passage with white walls,"
12577,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,And a white vault above where snow-stars shed
12578,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"A wintry twilight. Eva moved in awe,"
12579,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And held her peace, but the snow-maiden smiled,"
12580,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And talked and tripped along, as down the way,"
12581,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Deeper they went into that mountainous drift.
12582,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And now the white walls widened, and the vault"
12583,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Swelled upward, like some vast cathedral-dome,"
12584,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Such as the Florentine, who bore the name"
12585,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Of heaven's most potent angel, reared, long since,"
12586,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Or the unknown builder of that wondrous fane,"
12587,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"The glory of Burgos. Here a garden lay,"
12588,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,In which the Little People of the Snow
12589,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Were wont to take their pastime when their tasks
12590,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Upon the mountain's side and in the clouds
12591,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Were ended. Here they taught the silent frost
12592,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"To mock, in stem and spray, and leaf and flower,"
12593,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,The growths of summer. Here the palm upreared
12594,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Its white columnar trunk and spotless sheaf
12595,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Of plume-like leaves; here cedars, huge as those"
12596,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Of Lebanon, stretched far their level boughs,"
12597,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Yet pale and shadowless; the sturdy oak
12598,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Stood, with its huge gnarled roots of seeming strength,"
12599,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Fast anchored in the glistening bank; light sprays
12600,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Of myrtle, roses in their bud and bloom,"
12601,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Drooped by the winding walks; yet all seemed wrought
12602,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Of stainless alabaster; up the trees
12603,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Ran the lithe jessamine, with stalk and leaf"
12604,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Colorless as her flowers. ""Go softly on,"""
12605,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Said the snow-maiden; ""touch not, with thy hand,"
12606,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"The frail creation round thee, and beware"
12607,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,To sweep it with thy skirts. Now look above.
12608,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,How sumptuously these bowers are lighted up
12609,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,With shifting gleams that softly come and go!
12610,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"These are the northern lights, such as thou seest"
12611,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"In the midwinter nights, cold, wandering flames,"
12612,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"That float with our processions, through the air;"
12613,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And here, within our winter palaces,"
12614,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Mimic the glorious daybreak."" Then she told"
12615,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"How, when the wind, in the long winter nights,"
12616,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Swept the light snows into the hollow dell,"
12617,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,She and her comrades guided to its place
12618,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Each wandering flake, and piled them quaintly up,"
12619,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"In shapely colonnade and glistening arch,"
12620,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"With shadowy aisles between, or bade them grow,"
12621,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Beneath their little hands, to bowery walks"
12622,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"In gardens such as these, and, o'er them all,"
12623,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Built the broad roof. ""But thou hast yet to see"
12624,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"A fairer sight,"" she said, and led the way"
12625,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,To where a window of pellucid ice
12626,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Stood in the wall of snow, beside their path."
12627,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"""Look, but thou mayst not enter."" Eva looked,"
12628,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And lo! a glorious hall, from whose high vault"
12629,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Stripes of soft light, ruddy and delicate green,"
12630,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And tender blue, flowed downward to the floor"
12631,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And far around, as if the aërial hosts,"
12632,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"That march on high by night, with beamy spears,"
12633,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And streaming banners, to that place had brought"
12634,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Their radiant flags to grace a festival.
12635,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,And in that hall a joyous multitude
12636,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Of these by whom its glistening walls were reared,"
12637,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Whirled in a merry dance to silvery sounds,"
12638,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"That rang from cymbals of transparent ice,"
12639,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And ice-cups, quivering to the skilful touch"
12640,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Of little fingers. Round and round they flew,"
12641,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"As when, in spring, about a chimney-top,"
12642,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"A cloud of twittering swallows, just returned,"
12643,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Wheel round and round, and turn and wheel again,"
12644,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Unwinding their swift track. So rapidly
12645,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Flowed the meandering stream of that fair dance,"
12646,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Beneath that dome of light. Bright eyes that looked
12647,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"From under lily-brows, and gauzy scarfs"
12648,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Sparkling like snow-wreaths in the early sun,"
12649,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Shot by the window in their mazy whirl.
12650,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And there stood Eva, wondering at the sight"
12651,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Of those bright revellers and that graceful sweep
12652,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Of motion as they passed her;--long she gazed,"
12653,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,And listened long to the sweet sounds that thrilled
12654,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"The frosty air, till now the encroaching cold"
12655,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Recalled her to herself. ""Too long, too long"
12656,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"I linger here,"" she said, and then she sprang"
12657,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Into the path, and with a hurried step"
12658,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Followed it upward. Ever by her side
12659,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Her little guide kept pace. As on they went,"
12660,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Eva bemoaned her fault: ""What must they think--"
12661,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"The dear ones in the cottage, while so long,"
12662,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Hour after hour, I stay without? I know"
12663,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"That they will seek me far and near, and weep"
12664,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"To find me not. How could I, wickedly,"
12665,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Neglect the charge they gave me?"" As she spoke,"
12666,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,The hot tears started to her eyes; she knelt
12667,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"In the mid-path. ""Father! forgive this sin;"
12668,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Forgive myself I cannot""--thus she prayed,"
12669,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And rose and hastened onward. When, at last,"
12670,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"They reached the outer air, the clear north breathed"
12671,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"A bitter cold, from which she shrank with dread,"
12672,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,But the snow-maiden bounded as she felt
12673,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"The cutting blast, and uttered shouts of joy,"
12674,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And skipped, with boundless glee, from drift to drift,"
12675,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And danced round Eva, as she labored up"
12676,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"The mounds of snow. ""Ah me! I feel my eyes"
12677,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Grow heavy,"" Eva said; ""they swim with sleep;"
12678,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"I cannot walk for utter weariness,"
12679,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And I must rest a moment on this bank,"
12680,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"But let it not be long."" As thus she spoke,"
12681,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"In half formed words, she sank on the smooth snow,"
12682,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,With closing lids. Her guide composed the robe
12683,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"About her limbs, and said: ""A pleasant spot"
12684,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Is this to slumber in; on such a couch
12685,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Oft have I slept away the winter night,"
12686,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And had the sweetest dreams."" So Eva slept,"
12687,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,But slept in death; for when the power of frost
12688,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Locks up the motions of the living frame,"
12689,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,The victim passes to the realm of Death
12690,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Through the dim porch of Sleep. The little guide,"
12691,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Watching beside her, saw the hues of life"
12692,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Fade from the fair smooth brow and rounded cheek,"
12693,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"As fades the crimson from a morning cloud,"
12694,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Till they were white as marble, and the breath"
12695,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Had ceased to come and go, yet knew she not"
12696,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,At first that this was death. But when she marked
12697,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"How deep the paleness was, how motionless"
12698,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"That once lithe form, a fear came over her."
12699,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"She strove to wake the sleeper, plucked her robe,"
12700,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And shouted in her ear, but all in vain;"
12701,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,The life had passed away from those young limbs.
12702,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Then the snow-maiden raised a wailing cry,"
12703,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Such as the dweller in some lonely wild,"
12704,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Sleepless through all the long December night,"
12705,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Hears when the mournful East begins to blow.
12706,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"But suddenly was heard the sound of steps,"
12707,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Grating on the crisp snow; the cottagers
12708,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Were seeking Eva; from afar they saw
12709,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"The twain, and hurried toward them. As they came"
12710,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"With gentle chidings ready on their lips,"
12711,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And marked that deathlike sleep, and heard the tale"
12712,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Of the snow-maiden, mortal anguish fell"
12713,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Upon their hearts, and bitter words of grief"
12714,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And blame were uttered: ""Cruel, cruel one,"
12715,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"To tempt our daughter thus, and cruel we,"
12716,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Who suffered her to wander forth alone
12717,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"In this fierce cold!"" They lifted the dear child,"
12718,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And bore her home and chafed her tender limbs,"
12719,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And strove, by all the simple arts they knew,"
12720,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"To make the chilled blood move, and win the breath"
12721,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Back to her bosom; fruitlessly they strove;
12722,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,The little maid was dead. In blank despair
12723,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"They stood, and gazed at her who never more"
12724,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Should look on them. ""Why die we not with her?"""
12725,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"They said; ""without her, life is bitterness."""
12726,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Now came the funeral-day; the simple folk
12727,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Of all that pastoral region gathered round
12728,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,To share the sorrow of the cottagers.
12729,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,They carved a way into the mound of snow
12730,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"To the glen's side, and dug a little grave"
12731,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"In the smooth slope, and, following the bier,"
12732,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"In long procession from the silent door,"
12733,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Chanted a sad and solemn melody:
12734,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"""Lay her away to rest within the ground."
12735,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Yea, lay her down whose pure and innocent life"
12736,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Was spotless as these snows; for she was reared
12737,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"In love, and passed in love life's pleasant spring,"
12738,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,And all that now our tenderest love can do
12739,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Is to give burial to her lifeless limbs."""
12740,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"They paused. A thousand slender voices round,"
12741,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Like echoes softly flung from rock and hill,"
12742,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Took up the strain, and all the hollow air"
12743,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Seemed mourning for the dead; for, on that day,"
12744,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"The Little People of the Snow had come,"
12745,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"From mountain-peak, and cloud, and icy hall,"
12746,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"To Eva's burial. As the murmur died,"
12747,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,The funeral-train renewed the solemn chant:
12748,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"""Thou, Lord, hast taken her to be with Eve,"
12749,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Whose gentle name was given her. Even so,"
12750,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,For so Thy wisdom saw that it was best
12751,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"For her and us. We bring our bleeding hearts,"
12752,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And ask the touch of healing from Thy hand,"
12753,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"As, with submissive tears, we render back"
12754,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"The lovely and beloved to Him who gave."""
12755,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,They ceased. Again the plaintive murmur rose.
12756,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"From shadowy skirts of low-hung cloud it came,"
12757,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And wide white fields, and fir-trees capped with snow,"
12758,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Shivering to the sad sounds. They sank away
12759,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,To silence in the dim-seen distant woods.
12760,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,The little grave was closed; the funeral-train
12761,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Departed; winter wore away; the Spring
12762,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Steeped, with her quickening rains, the violet-tufts,"
12763,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,By fond hands planted where the maiden slept.
12764,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"But, after Eva's burial, never more"
12765,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,The Little People of the Snow were seen
12766,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"By human eye, nor ever human ear"
12767,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Heard from their lips articulate speech again;
12768,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"For a decree went forth to cut them off,"
12769,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Forever, from communion with mankind."
12770,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"The winter-clouds, along the mountain-side,"
12771,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Rolled downward toward the vale, but no fair form"
12772,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Leaned from their folds, and, in the icy glens,"
12773,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"And aged woods, under snow-loaded pines,"
12774,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Where once they made their haunt, was emptiness."
12775,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"But ever, when the wintry days drew near,"
12776,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"Around that little grave, in the long night,"
12777,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,Frost-wreaths were laid and tufts of silvery rime
12778,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,"In shape like blades and blossoms of the field,"
12779,THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.,As one would scatter flowers upon a bier.

14353,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"And there alone, is Life. The Present there"
14354,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Tosses and foams, and fills the air with roar"
14355,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Of mingled noises. There are they who toil,"
14356,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"And they who strive, and they who feast, and they"
14357,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Who hurry to and fro. The sturdy swain--
14358,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Woodman and delver with the spade--is there,"
14359,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"And busy artisan beside his bench,"
14360,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,And pallid student with his written roll.
14361,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"A moment on the mounting billow seen,"
14362,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,The flood sweeps over them and they are gone.
14363,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,There groups of revellers whose brows are twined
14364,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"With roses, ride the topmost swell awhile,"
14365,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,And as they raise their flowing cups and touch
14366,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"The clinking brim to brim, are whirled beneath"
14367,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,The waves and disappear. I hear the jar
14368,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Of beaten drums, and thunders that break forth"
14369,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"From cannon, where the advancing billow sends"
14370,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Up to the sight long files of armèd men,"
14371,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,That hurry to the charge through flame and smoke.
14372,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"The torrent bears them under, whelmed and hid"
14373,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Slayer and slain, in heaps of bloody foam."
14374,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Down go the steed and rider, the plumed chief"
14375,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Sinks with his followers; the head that wears
14376,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,The imperial diadem goes down beside
14377,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,The felon's with cropped ear and branded cheek.
14378,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,A funeral-train--the torrent sweeps away
14379,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Bearers and bier and mourners. By the bed
14380,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Of one who dies men gather sorrowing,"
14381,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,And women weep aloud; the flood rolls on;
14382,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,The wail is stifled and the sobbing group
14383,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Borne under. Hark to that shrill, sudden shout,"
14384,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"The cry of an applauding multitude,"
14385,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Swayed by some loud-voiced orator who wields
14386,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,The living mass as if he were its soul!
14387,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,The waters choke the shout and all is still.
14388,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Lo! next a kneeling crowd, and one who spreads"
14389,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,The hands in prayer--the engulfing wave o'ertakes
14390,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,And swallows them and him. A sculptor wields
14391,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"The chisel, and the stricken marble grows"
14392,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"To beauty; at his easel, eager-eyed,"
14393,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"A painter stands, and sunshine at his touch"
14394,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Gathers upon his canvas, and life glows;"
14395,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"A poet, as he paces to and fro,"
14396,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Murmurs his sounding lines. Awhile they ride
14397,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"The advancing billow, till its tossing crest"
14398,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Strikes them and flings them under, while their tasks"
14399,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Are yet unfinished. See a mother smile
14400,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,On her young babe that smiles to her again;
14401,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,The torrent wrests it from her arms; she shrieks
14402,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"And weeps, and midst her tears is carried down."
14403,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,A beam like that of moonlight turns the spray
14404,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"To glistening pearls; two lovers, hand in hand,"
14405,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Rise on the billowy swell and fondly look
14406,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Into each other's eyes. The rushing flood
14407,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Flings them apart: the youth goes down; the maid
14408,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"With hands outstretched in vain, and streaming eyes,"
14409,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Waits for the next high wave to follow him.
14410,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,An aged man succeeds; his bending form
14411,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Sinks slowly. Mingling with the sullen stream
14412,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Gleam the white locks, and then are seen no more."
14413,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Lo! wider grows the stream--a sea-like flood
14414,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Saps earth's walled cities; massive palaces
14415,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Crumble before it; fortresses and towers
14416,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Dissolve in the swift waters; populous realms
14417,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Swept by the torrent see their ancient tribes
14418,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Engulfed and lost; their very languages
14419,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Stifled, and never to be uttered more."
14420,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"I pause and turn my eyes, and looking back"
14421,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Where that tumultuous flood has been, I see"
14422,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"The silent ocean of the Past, a waste"
14423,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Of waters weltering over graves, its shores"
14424,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Strewn with the wreck of fleets where mast and hull
14425,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Drop away piecemeal; battlemented walls
14426,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Frown idly, green with moss, and temples stand"
14427,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Unroofed, forsaken by the worshipper."
14428,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"There lie memorial stones, whence time has gnawed"
14429,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"The graven legends, thrones of kings o'erturned,"
14430,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"The broken altars of forgotten gods,"
14431,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Foundations of old cities and long streets
14432,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Where never fall of human foot is heard,"
14433,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,On all the desolate pavement. I behold
14434,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Dim glimmerings of lost jewels, far within"
14435,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"The sleeping waters, diamond, sardonyx,"
14436,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Ruby and topaz, pearl and chrysolite,"
14437,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Once glittering at the banquet on fair brows
14438,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"That long ago were dust, and all around"
14439,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Strewn on the surface of that silent sea
14440,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Are withering bridal wreaths, and glossy locks"
14441,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Shorn from dear brows, by loving hands, and scrolls"
14442,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"O'er written, haply with fond words of love"
14443,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"And vows of friendship, and fair pages flung"
14444,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Fresh from the printer's engine. There they lie
14445,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"A moment, and then sink away from sight."
14446,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"I look, and the quick tears are in my eyes,"
14447,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,For I behold in every one of these
14448,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"A blighted hope, a separate history"
14449,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Of human sorrows, telling of dear ties"
14450,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Suddenly broken, dreams of happiness"
14451,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Dissolved in air, and happy days too brief"
14452,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"That sorrowfully ended, and I think"
14453,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,How painfully must the poor heart have beat
14454,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"In bosoms without number, as the blow"
14455,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Was struck that slew their hope and broke their peace.
14456,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Sadly I turn and look before, where yet"
14457,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"The Flood must pass, and I behold a mist"
14458,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Where swarm dissolving forms, the brood of Hope,"
14459,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Divinely fair, that rest on banks of flowers,"
14460,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Or wander among rainbows, fading soon"
14461,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"And reappearing, haply giving place"
14462,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,To forms of grisly aspect such as Fear
14463,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Shapes from the idle air--where serpents lift
14464,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"The head to strike, and skeletons stretch forth"
14465,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,The bony arm in menace. Further on
14466,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,A belt of darkness seems to bar the way
14467,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Long, low, and distant, where the Life to come"
14468,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Touches the Life that is. The Flood of Years
14469,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Rolls toward it near and nearer. It must pass
14470,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,That dismal barrier. What is there beyond?
14471,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Hear what the wise and good have said. Beyond
14472,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"That belt of darkness, still the Years roll on"
14473,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"More gently, but with not less mighty sweep."
14474,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,They gather up again and softly bear
14475,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,All the sweet lives that late were overwhelmed
14476,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"And lost to sight, all that in them was good,"
14477,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Noble, and truly great, and worthy of love--"
14478,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"The lives of infants and ingenuous youths,"
14479,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Sages and saintly women who have made
14480,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Their households happy; all are raised and borne
14481,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"By that great current in its onward sweep,"
14482,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Wandering and rippling with caressing waves
14483,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Around green islands with the breath
14484,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Of flowers that never wither. So they pass
14485,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,From stage to stage along the shining course
14486,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Of that bright river, broadening like a sea."
14487,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,As its smooth eddies curl along their way
14488,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,They bring old friends together; hands are clasped
14489,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,In joy unspeakable; the mother's arms
14490,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Again are folded round the child she loved
14491,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"And lost. Old sorrows are forgotten now,"
14492,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Or but remembered to make sweet the hour
14493,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,That overpays them; wounded hearts that bled
14494,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,Or broke are healed forever. In the room
14495,THE FLOOD OF YEARS.,"Of this grief-shadowed present, there shall be"

14629,THE MURDERED TRAVELLER.,solitary road passing between the mountains west of the village of
14630,THE MURDERED TRAVELLER.,Stockbridge. It was supposed that the person came to his death by
14631,THE MURDERED TRAVELLER.,"violence, but no traces could be discovered of his murderers. It was"
14632,THE MURDERED TRAVELLER.,"only recollected that one evening, in the course of the previous winter,"
14633,THE MURDERED TRAVELLER.,a traveller had stopped at an inn in the village of West Stockbridge:
14634,THE MURDERED TRAVELLER.,"that he had inquired the way to Stockbridge; and that, in paying the"
14635,THE MURDERED TRAVELLER.,"innkeeper for something he had ordered, it appeared that he had a"
14636,THE MURDERED TRAVELLER.,considerable sum of money in his possession. Two ill-looking men were
14637,THE MURDERED TRAVELLER.,"present, and went out about the same time that the traveller proceeded"
14638,THE MURDERED TRAVELLER.,"on his journey. During the winter, also, two men of shabby appearance,"
14639,THE MURDERED TRAVELLER.,"but plentifully supplied with money, had lingered for a while about the"
14640,THE MURDERED TRAVELLER.,"village of Stockbridge. Several years afterward, a criminal, about to be"

15128,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"The literature of Spain at the present day has this peculiarity, that"
15129,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"female writers have, in considerable number, entered into competition"
15130,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"with the other sex. One of the most remarkable of these, as a writer of"
15131,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"both prose and poetry, is Carolina Coronado de Perry, the author of the"
15132,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,little poem here given. The poetical literature of Spain has felt the
15133,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,influence of the female mind in the infusion of a certain delicacy and
15134,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"tenderness, and the more frequent choice of subjects which interest the"
15135,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,domestic affections. Concerning the verses of the lady already
15136,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"mentioned, Don Juan Eugenio Hartzenbusch, one of the most accomplished"
15137,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"Spanish critics of the present day, and himself a successful dramatic"
15138,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"writer, says:"

15147,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"brevity of development, and delicate and particular choice of subject,"
15148,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,we should be constrained to attribute them to one yet in his early
15149,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"youth, whom the imagination would represent as ingenuous, innocent, and"
15150,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"gay, who had scarce ever wandered beyond the flowery grove or pleasant"
15151,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"valley where his cradle was rocked, and where he has been lulled to"
15152,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"sleep by the sweetest songs of Francisea de la Torre, Garcilaso, and"

15157,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"The author of the _Pájaro Perdido_, according to a memoir of her by"
15158,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"Angel Fernandez de los Rios, was born at Almendralejo, in Estremadura,"
15159,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"in 1823. At the age of nine years she began to steal from sleep, after a"
15160,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"day passed in various lessons, and in domestic occupations, several"
15161,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"hours every night to read the poets of her country, and other books"
15162,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"belonging to the library of the household, among which are mentioned, as"
15163,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"a proof of her vehement love of reading, the ""Critical History of"
15164,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"Spain,"" by the Abbé Masuden, ""and other works equally dry and prolix."""
15165,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"She was afterward sent to Badajoz, where she received the best education"
15166,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"which the state of the country, then on fire with a civil war, would"
15167,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,admit. Here the intensity of her application to her studies caused a
15168,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"severe malady, which has frequently recurred in after-life. At the age"
15169,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"of thirteen years she wrote a poem entitled _La Palma_, which the author"
15170,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"of her biography declares to be worthy of Herrera, and which led"
15171,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"Espronceda, a poet of Estremadura, a man of genius, and the author of"
15172,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"several translations from Byron, whom he resembled both in mental and"
15173,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"personal characteristics, to address her an eulogistic sonnet. In 1843,"
15174,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"when she was but twenty years old, a volume of her poems was published"
15175,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"at Madrid, in which were included both that entitled _La Palma_ and the"
15176,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"one I have given in this note. To this volume Hartzenbusch, in his"
15177,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"admiration for her genius, prefaced an introduction."
15178,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,
15179,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,The task of writing verses in Spanish is not difficult. Rhymes are
15180,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"readily found, and the language is easily moulded into metrical forms."
15181,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,Those who have distinguished themselves in this literature have
15182,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"generally made their first essays in verse. What is remarkable enough,"
15183,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,the men who afterward figured in political life mostly began their
15184,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,career as the authors of madrigals. A poem introduces the future
15185,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"statesman to the public, as a speech at a popular meeting introduces the"
15186,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,candidate for political distinctions in this country. I have heard of
15187,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"but one of the eminent Spanish politicians of the present time, who made"
15188,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,a boast that he was innocent of poetry; and if all that his enemies say
15189,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"of him be true, it would have been well both for his country and his own"
15190,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"fame, if he had been equally innocent of corrupt practices. The"
15191,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"compositions of Carolina Coronado, even her earliest, do not deserve to"
15192,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"be classed with the productions of which I have spoken, and which are"
15193,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,simply the effect of inclination and facility. They possess the _mens
15194,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,divinior_.
15195,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,
15196,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,In 1852 a collection of poems of Carolina Coronado was brought out at
15197,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"Madrid, including those which were first published. The subjects are of"
15198,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,larger variety than those which prompted her earlier productions; some
15199,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"of them are of a religious cast, others refer to political matters. One"
15200,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"of them, which appears among the ""Improvisations,"" is an energetic"
15201,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,protest against erecting a new amphitheatre for bull-fights. The spirit
15202,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,in all her poetry is humane and friendly to the best interests of
15203,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,mankind.
15204,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,
15205,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,Her writings in prose must not be overlooked. Among them is a novel
15206,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"entitled _Sigea_, founded on the adventures of Camoëns; another entitled"
15207,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"_Jarilla_, a beautiful story, full of pictures of rural life in"
15208,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"Estremadura, which deserves, if it could find a competent translator, to"
15209,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,be transferred to our language. Besides these there are two other novels
15210,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"from her pen, _Paquita_ and _La Luz del Tejo_. A few years since"
15211,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"appeared, in a Madrid periodical, the _Semanario_, a series of letters"
15212,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"written by her, giving an account of the impressions received in a"
15213,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"journey from the Tagus to the Rhine, including a visit to England. Among"
15214,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"the subjects on which she has written, is the idea, still warmly"
15215,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"cherished in Spain, of uniting the entire peninsula under one"
15216,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"government. In an ably-conducted journal of Madrid, she has given"
15217,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"accounts of the poetesses of Spain, her contemporaries, with extracts"
15218,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"from their writings, and a kindly estimate of their respective merits."
15219,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,
15220,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,Her biographer speaks of her activity and efficiency in charitable
15221,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"enterprises, her interest in the cause of education, her visits to the"
15222,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"primary schools of Madrid, encouraging and rewarding the pupils, and her"
15223,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"patronage of the _escuela de parvules_, or infant school at Badajoz,"
15224,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"established by a society of that city, with the design of improving the"
15225,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,education of the laboring class.
15226,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,
15227,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"It must have been not long after the publication of her poems, in 1852,"
15228,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"that Carolina Coronado became the wife of an American gentleman, Mr."
15229,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"Horatio J. Perry, at one time our Secretary of Legation at the Court of"
15230,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"Madrid, afterward our _Chargé d'Affaires_, and now, in 1863, again"
15231,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"Secretary of Legation. Amid the duties of a wife and mother, which she"
15232,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,"fulfils with exemplary fidelity and grace, she has neither forgotten nor"
15233,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,forsaken the literary pursuits which have given her so high a
15234,EL PÁJARO PERDIDO.,reputation.
