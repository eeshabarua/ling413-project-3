79,XII.,"Knowing my coat has never been Of precisely the fashion To stimulate, in her, A durable passion; "
80,XII.,"Doubtful, somewhat, of the value Of well-gowned approbation Of literary effort, But never of The Lady Valentine's vocation: "
81,XII.,"Poetry, her border of ideas, The edge, uncertain, but a means of blending With other strata Where the lower and higher have ending; "
82,XII.,"A hook to catch the Lady Jane's attention, A modulation toward the theatre, Also, in the case of revolution, A possible friend and comforter. "

88,ENVOI (1919),"Tell her that sheds Such treasure in the air, Recking naught else but that her graces give Life to the moment, I would bid them live As roses might, in magic amber laid, Red overwrought with orange and all made One substance and one colour Braving time. "
89,ENVOI (1919),"Tell her that goes With song upon her lips But sings not out the song, nor knows The maker of it, some other mouth, May be as fair as hers, Might, in new ages, gain her worshippers, When our two dusts with Waller's shall be laid, Siftings on siftings in oblivion, Till change hath broken down All things save Beauty alone.
