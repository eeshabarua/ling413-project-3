37,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
38,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,_S’io credesse che mia risposta fosse
39,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"A persona che mai tornasse al mondo,"
40,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse.
41,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Ma perciocche giammai di questo fondo
42,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Non torno vivo alcun, s’i’odo il vero,"
43,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Senza tema d’infamia ti rispondo._
44,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
45,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
46,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
47,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Let us go then, you and I,"
48,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,When the evening is spread out against the sky
49,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Like a patient etherized upon a table;
50,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,"
51,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,The muttering retreats
52,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
53,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:
54,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Streets that follow like a tedious argument
55,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Of insidious intent
56,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,To lead you to an overwhelming question ...
57,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Oh, do not ask, “What is it?”"
58,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Let us go and make our visit.
59,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
60,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,In the room the women come and go
61,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Talking of Michelangelo.
62,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
63,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,"
64,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,"
65,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,"
66,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,"
67,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,"
68,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,"
69,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"And seeing that it was a soft October night,"
70,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Curled once about the house, and fell asleep."
71,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
72,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,And indeed there will be time
73,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,"
74,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;
75,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"There will be time, there will be time"
76,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;
77,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"There will be time to murder and create,"
78,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,And time for all the works and days of hands
79,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,That lift and drop a question on your plate;
80,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Time for you and time for me,"
81,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"And time yet for a hundred indecisions,"
82,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"And for a hundred visions and revisions,"
83,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Before the taking of a toast and tea.
84,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
85,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,In the room the women come and go
86,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Talking of Michelangelo.
87,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
88,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,And indeed there will be time
89,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"To wonder, “Do I dare?” and, “Do I dare?”"
90,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Time to turn back and descend the stair,"
91,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,With a bald spot in the middle of my hair--
92,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,(They will say: “How his hair is growing thin!”)
93,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,"
94,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin--"
95,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,(They will say: “But how his arms and legs are thin!”)
96,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Do I dare
97,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Disturb the universe?
98,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,In a minute there is time
99,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.
100,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
101,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"For I have known them all already, known them all:"
102,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,"
103,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;
104,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,I know the voices dying with a dying fall
105,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Beneath the music from a farther room.
106,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,So how should I presume?
107,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"And I have known the eyes already, known them all--"
108,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,"
109,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,"
110,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,"
111,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Then how should I begin
112,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?
113,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,And how should I presume?
114,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
115,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"And I have known the arms already, known them all--"
116,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Arms that are braceleted and white and bare
117,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"(But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)"
118,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Is it perfume from a dress
119,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,That makes me so digress?
120,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl."
121,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,And should I then presume?
122,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,And how should I begin?
123,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
124,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,*         *         *         *
125,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
126,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets"
127,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes
128,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? ..."
129,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
130,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,I should have been a pair of ragged claws
131,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.
132,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
133,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,*         *         *         *
134,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
135,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!"
136,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Smoothed by long fingers,"
137,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,"
138,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me."
139,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,"
140,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
141,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,"
142,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,"
143,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,I am no prophet--and here’s no great matter;
144,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,"
145,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,"
146,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"And in short, I was afraid."
147,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
148,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"And would it have been worth it, after all,"
149,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,"
150,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,"
151,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Would it have been worth while,"
152,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"To have bitten off the matter with a smile,"
153,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,To have squeezed the universe into a ball
154,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"To roll it toward some overwhelming question,"
155,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"To say: “I am Lazarus, come from the dead,"
156,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all”--"
157,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"If one, settling a pillow by her head,"
158,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Should say: “That is not what I meant at all;
159,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"That is not it, at all.”"
160,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
161,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"And would it have been worth it, after all,"
162,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Would it have been worth while,"
163,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,"
164,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the"
165,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,floor--
166,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"And this, and so much more?--"
167,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,It is impossible to say just what I mean!
168,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:
169,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Would it have been worth while
170,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,"
171,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"And turning toward the window, should say:"
172,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"“That is not it at all,"
173,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"That is not what I meant, at all.”"
174,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
175,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,*         *         *         *
176,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
177,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;"
178,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Am an attendant lord, one that will do"
179,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"To swell a progress, start a scene or two,"
180,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,"
181,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Deferential, glad to be of use,"
182,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Politic, cautious, and meticulous;"
183,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;"
184,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"At times, indeed, almost ridiculous--"
185,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Almost, at times, the Fool."
186,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
187,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,I grow old ... I grow old ...
188,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.
189,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
190,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?
191,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach."
192,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each."
193,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
194,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,I do not think that they will sing to me.
195,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
196,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,I have seen them riding seaward on the waves
197,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Combing the white hair of the waves blown back
198,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,When the wind blows the water white and black.
199,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,We have lingered in the chambers of the sea
200,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown
201,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Till human voices wake us, and we drown."
202,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
203,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
204,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
205,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
206,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Portrait of a Lady
207,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
208,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,Thou hast committed--
209,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"Fornication: but that was in another country,"
210,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,"And besides, the wench is dead."
211,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,The Jew Of Malta
212,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
213,PRUFROCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS,
214,I,I
215,I,
216,I,Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
217,I,You have the scene arrange itself--as it will seem to do--
218,I,With “I have saved this afternoon for you”;
219,I,"And four wax candles in the darkened room,"
220,I,"Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,"
221,I,An atmosphere of Juliet’s tomb
222,I,"Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid."
223,I,"We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole"
224,I,"Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger tips."
225,I,"“So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul"
226,I,Should be resurrected only among friends
227,I,"Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom"
228,I,That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room.”
229,I,--And so the conversation slips
230,I,Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
231,I,Through attenuated tones of violins
232,I,Mingled with remote cornets
233,I,And begins.
234,I,
235,I,"“You do not know how much they mean to me, my friends,"
236,I,"And how, how rare and strange it is, to find"
237,I,"In a life composed so much, so much of odds and ends,"
238,I,(For indeed I do not love it ... you knew? you are not blind!
239,I,How keen you are!)
240,I,"To find a friend who has these qualities,"
241,I,"Who has, and gives"
242,I,Those qualities upon which friendship lives.
243,I,How much it means that I say this to you--
244,I,"Without these friendships--life, what cauchemar!”"
245,I,Among the windings of the violins
246,I,And the ariettes
247,I,Of cracked cornets
248,I,Inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins
249,I,"Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own,"
250,I,Capricious monotone
251,I,That is at least one definite “false note.”
252,I,"--Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance,"
253,I,Admire the monuments
254,I,"Discuss the late events,"
255,I,Correct our watches by the public clocks.
256,I,Then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks.
257,I,
258,I,
259,II,II
260,II,
261,II,Now that lilacs are in bloom
262,II,She has a bowl of lilacs in her room
263,II,And twists one in her fingers while she talks.
264,II,"“Ah, my friend, you do not know, you do not know"
265,II,"What life is, you who hold it in your hands”;"
266,II,(Slowly twisting the lilac stalks)
267,II,"“You let it flow from you, you let it flow,"
268,II,"And youth is cruel, and has no remorse"
269,II,And smiles at situations which it cannot see.”
270,II,"I smile, of course,"
271,II,And go on drinking tea.
272,II,"“Yet with these April sunsets, that somehow recall"
273,II,"My buried life, and Paris in the Spring,"
274,II,"I feel immeasurably at peace, and find the world"
275,II,"To be wonderful and youthful, after all.”"
276,II,
277,II,The voice returns like the insistent out-of-tune
278,II,Of a broken violin on an August afternoon:
279,II,“I am always sure that you understand
280,II,"My feelings, always sure that you feel,"
281,II,Sure that across the gulf you reach your hand.
282,II,
283,II,"You are invulnerable, you have no Achilles’ heel."
284,II,"You will go on, and when you have prevailed"
285,II,You can say: at this point many a one has failed.
286,II,
287,II,"But what have I, but what have I, my friend,"
288,II,"To give you, what can you receive from me?"
289,II,Only the friendship and the sympathy
290,II,Of one about to reach her journey’s end.
291,II,
292,II,"I shall sit here, serving tea to friends....”"
293,II,
294,II,I take my hat: how can I make a cowardly amends
295,II,For what she has said to me?
296,II,You will see me any morning in the park
297,II,Reading the comics and the sporting page.
298,II,Particularly I remark
299,II,An English countess goes upon the stage.
300,II,"A Greek was murdered at a Polish dance,"
301,II,Another bank defaulter has confessed.
302,II,"I keep my countenance,"
303,II,I remain self-possessed
304,II,"Except when a street piano, mechanical and tired"
305,II,Reiterates some worn-out common song
306,II,With the smell of hyacinths across the garden
307,II,Recalling things that other people have desired.
308,II,Are these ideas right or wrong?
309,II,
310,II,
311,III,III
312,III,
313,III,The October night comes down; returning as before
314,III,Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease
315,III,I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door
316,III,And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and knees.
317,III,
318,III,“And so you are going abroad; and when do you return?
319,III,But that’s a useless question.
320,III,"You hardly know when you are coming back,"
321,III,You will find so much to learn.”
322,III,My smile falls heavily among the bric-à-brac.
323,III,
324,III,“Perhaps you can write to me.”
325,III,My self-possession flares up for a second;
326,III,This is as I had reckoned.
327,III,“I have been wondering frequently of late
328,III,(But our beginnings never know our ends!)
329,III,Why we have not developed into friends.”
330,III,"I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark"
331,III,"Suddenly, his expression in a glass."
332,III,My self-possession gutters; we are really in the dark.
333,III,
334,III,"“For everybody said so, all our friends,"
335,III,They all were sure our feelings would relate
336,III,So closely! I myself can hardly understand.
337,III,We must leave it now to fate.
338,III,"You will write, at any rate."
339,III,"Perhaps it is not too late,"
340,III,"I shall sit here, serving tea to friends.”"
341,III,
342,III,And I must borrow every changing
343,III,"find expression ... dance, dance"
344,III,"Like a dancing bear,"
345,III,"Cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape."
346,III,"Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance--"
347,III,
348,III,"Well! and what if she should die some afternoon,"
349,III,"Afternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose;"
350,III,Should die and leave me sitting pen in hand
351,III,With the smoke coming down above the housetops;
352,III,"Doubtful, for quite a while"
353,III,Not knowing what to feel or if I understand
354,III,"Or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon ..."
355,III,"Would she not have the advantage, after all?"
356,III,This music is successful with a “dying fall”
357,III,Now that we talk of dying--
358,III,And should I have the right to smile?
359,III,
360,III,
361,III,
362,III,
363,III,Preludes
364,III,
365,I,I
366,I,
367,I,The winter evening settles down
368,I,With smell of steaks in passageways.
369,I,Six o’clock.
370,I,The burnt-out ends of smoky days.
371,I,And now a gusty shower wraps
372,I,The grimy scraps
373,I,Of withered leaves about your feet
374,I,And newspapers from vacant lots;
375,I,The showers beat
376,I,"On broken blinds and chimney-pots,"
377,I,And at the corner of the street
378,I,A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.
379,I,And then the lighting of the lamps.
380,I,
381,I,
382,II,II
383,II,
384,II,The morning comes to consciousness
385,II,Of faint stale smells of beer
386,II,From the sawdust-trampled street
387,II,With all its muddy feet that press
388,II,To early coffee-stands.
389,II,With the other masquerades
390,II,"That time resumes,"
391,II,One thinks of all the hands
392,II,That are raising dingy shades
393,II,In a thousand furnished rooms.
394,II,
395,II,
396,III,III
397,III,
398,III,"You tossed a blanket from the bed,"
399,III,"You lay upon your back, and waited;"
400,III,"You dozed, and watched the night revealing"
401,III,The thousand sordid images
402,III,Of which your soul was constituted;
403,III,They flickered against the ceiling.
404,III,And when all the world came back
405,III,"And the light crept up between the shutters,"
406,III,"And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,"
407,III,You had such a vision of the street
408,III,As the street hardly understands;
409,III,"Sitting along the bed’s edge, where"
410,III,"You curled the papers from your hair,"
411,III,Or clasped the yellow soles of feet
412,III,In the palms of both soiled hands.
413,III,
414,III,
415,IV,IV
416,IV,
417,IV,His soul stretched tight across the skies
418,IV,"That fade behind a city block,"
419,IV,Or trampled by insistent feet
420,IV,At four and five and six o’clock
421,IV,"And short square fingers stuffing pipes,"
422,IV,"And evening newspapers, and eyes"
423,IV,"Assured of certain certainties,"
424,IV,The conscience of a blackened street
425,IV,Impatient to assume the world.
426,IV,I am moved by fancies that are curled
427,IV,"Around these images, and cling:"
428,IV,The notion of some infinitely gentle
429,IV,Infinitely suffering thing.
430,IV,"Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;"
431,IV,The worlds revolve like ancient women
432,IV,Gathering fuel in vacant lots.
433,IV,
434,IV,
435,IV,
436,IV,
437,IV,Rhapsody on a Windy Night
438,IV,
439,IV,Twelve o’clock.
440,IV,Along the reaches of the street
441,IV,"Held in a lunar synthesis,"
442,IV,Whispering lunar incantations
443,IV,Dissolve the floors of the memory
444,IV,"And all its clear relations,"
445,IV,"Its divisions and precisions,"
446,IV,Every street lamp that I pass
447,IV,"Beats like a fatalistic drum,"
448,IV,And through the spaces of the dark
449,IV,Midnight shakes the memory
450,IV,As a madman shakes a dead geranium.
451,IV,
452,IV,"Half-past one,"
453,IV,"The street lamp sputtered,"
454,IV,"The street lamp muttered,"
455,IV,"The street lamp said,"
456,IV,“Regard that woman
457,IV,Who hesitates toward you in the light of the door
458,IV,Which opens on her like a grin.
459,IV,You see the border of her dress
460,IV,"Is torn and stained with sand,"
461,IV,And you see the corner of her eye
462,IV,Twists like a crooked pin.”
463,IV,
464,IV,The memory throws up high and dry
465,IV,A crowd of twisted things;
466,IV,A twisted branch upon the beach
467,IV,"Eaten smooth, and polished"
468,IV,As if the world gave up
469,IV,"The secret of its skeleton,"
470,IV,Stiff and white.
471,IV,"A broken spring in a factory yard,"
472,IV,Rust that clings to the form that the strength has left
473,IV,Hard and curled and ready to snap.
474,IV,
475,IV,"Half-past two,"
476,IV,"The street lamp said,"
477,IV,"“Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,"
478,IV,Slips out its tongue
479,IV,And devours a morsel of rancid butter.”
480,IV,"So the hand of a child, automatic"
481,IV,Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay.
482,IV,I could see nothing behind that child’s eye.
483,IV,I have seen eyes in the street
484,IV,"Trying to peer through lighted shutters,"
485,IV,"And a crab one afternoon in a pool,"
486,IV,"An old crab with barnacles on his back,"
487,IV,Gripped the end of a stick which I held him.
488,IV,
489,IV,"Half-past three,"
490,IV,"The lamp sputtered,"
491,IV,The lamp muttered in the dark.
492,IV,
493,IV,The lamp hummed:
494,IV,"“Regard the moon,"
495,IV,"La lune ne garde aucune rancune,"
496,IV,"She winks a feeble eye,"
497,IV,She smiles into corners.
498,IV,She smoothes the hair of the grass.
499,IV,The moon has lost her memory.
500,IV,"A washed-out smallpox cracks her face,"
501,IV,"Her hand twists a paper rose,"
502,IV,"That smells of dust and old Cologne,"
503,IV,She is alone
504,IV,With all the old nocturnal smells
505,IV,That cross and cross across her brain.
506,IV,The reminiscence comes
507,IV,Of sunless dry geraniums
508,IV,"And dust in crevices,"
509,IV,"Smells of chestnuts in the streets,"
510,IV,"And female smells in shuttered rooms,"
511,IV,And cigarettes in corridors
512,IV,And cocktail smells in bars.”
513,IV,
514,IV,"The lamp said,"
515,IV,"“Four o’clock,"
516,IV,Here is the number on the door.
517,IV,Memory!
518,IV,"You have the key,"
519,IV,"The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair,"
520,IV,Mount.
521,IV,The bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the wall
522,IV,"Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life.”"
523,IV,
524,IV,The last twist of the knife.
525,IV,
526,IV,
527,IV,
528,IV,
529,IV,Morning at the Window
530,IV,
531,IV,"They are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens,"
532,IV,And along the trampled edges of the street
533,IV,I am aware of the damp souls of housemaids
534,IV,Sprouting despondently at area gates.
535,IV,
536,IV,The brown waves of fog toss up to me
537,IV,"Twisted faces from the bottom of the street,"
538,IV,And tear from a passer-by with muddy skirts
539,IV,An aimless smile that hovers in the air
540,IV,And vanishes along the level of the roofs.
541,IV,
542,IV,
543,IV,
544,IV,
545,IV,The Boston Evening Transcript
546,IV,
547,IV,The readers of the Boston Evening Transcript
548,IV,Sway in the blind like a field of ripe corn.
549,IV,"When evening quickens faintly in the street,"
550,IV,Wakening the appetites of life in some
551,IV,"And to others bringing the Boston Evening Transcript,"
552,IV,"I mount the steps and ring the bell, turning"
553,IV,"Wearily, as one would turn to nod good-bye to Rochefoucauld"
554,IV,"If the street were time and he at the end of the street,"
555,IV,"And I say, “Cousin Harriet, here is the Boston Evening Transcript.”"
556,IV,
557,IV,
558,IV,
559,IV,
560,IV,Aunt Helen
561,IV,
562,IV,"Miss Helen Slingsby was my maiden aunt,"
563,IV,And lived in a small house near a fashionable square
564,IV,Cared for by servants to the number of four.
565,IV,Now when she died there was silence in heaven
566,IV,And silence at her end of the street.
567,IV,The shutters were drawn and the undertaker wiped his feet--
568,IV,He was aware that this sort of thing had occurred before.
569,IV,"The dogs were handsomely provided for,"
570,IV,But shortly afterwards the parrot died too.
571,IV,"The Dresden clock continued ticking on the mantelpiece,"
572,IV,And the footman sat upon the dining-table
573,IV,Holding the second housemaid on his knees--
574,IV,Who had always been so careful while her mistress lived.
575,IV,
576,IV,
577,IV,
578,IV,
579,IV,Cousin Nancy
580,IV,
581,IV,Miss Nancy Ellicot
582,IV,Strode across the hills and broke them
583,IV,Rode across the hills and broke them--
584,IV,The barren New England hills
585,IV,Riding to hounds
586,IV,Over the cow-pasture.
587,IV,
588,IV,Miss Nancy Ellicott smoked
589,IV,And danced all the modern dances;
590,IV,"And her aunts were not quite sure how they felt about it,"
591,IV,But they knew that it was modern.
592,IV,
593,IV,Upon the glazen shelves kept watch
594,IV,"Matthew and Waldo, guardians of the faith,"
595,IV,The army of unalterable law.
596,IV,
597,IV,
598,IV,
599,IV,
600,IV,Mr. Apollinax
601,IV,
602,IV,When Mr. Apollinax visited the United States
603,IV,His laughter tinkled among the teacups.
604,IV,"I thought of Fragilion, that shy figure among the birch-trees,"
605,IV,And of Priapus in the shrubbery
606,IV,Gaping at the lady in the swing.
607,IV,"In the palace of Mrs. Phlaccus, at Professor Channing-Cheetah’s"
608,IV,He laughed like an irresponsible foetus.
609,IV,His laughter was submarine and profound
610,IV,Like the old man of the seats
611,IV,Hidden under coral islands
612,IV,"Where worried bodies of drowned men drift down in the green silence,"
613,IV,Dropping from fingers of surf.
614,IV,"I looked for the head of Mr. Apollinax rolling under a chair,"
615,IV,Or grinning over a screen
616,IV,With seaweed in its hair.
617,IV,I heard the beat of centaurs’ hoofs over the hard turf
618,IV,As his dry and passionate talk devoured the afternoon.
619,IV,“He is a charming man”--“But after all what did he mean?”--
620,IV,"“He has pointed ears ... he must be unbalanced,”--"
621,IV,“There was something he said that I might have challenged.”
622,IV,"Of dowager Mrs. Phlaccus, and Professor and Mrs. Cheetah"
623,IV,I remember a slice of lemon and a bitten macaroon.
624,IV,
625,IV,
626,IV,
627,IV,
628,IV,Hysteria
629,IV,
630,IV,As she laughed I was aware of becoming involved in her laughter and
631,IV,"being part of it, until her teeth were only accidental stars with a"
632,IV,"talent for squad-drill. I was drawn in by short gasps, inhaled at"
633,IV,"each momentary recovery, lost finally in the dark caverns of her"
634,IV,"throat, bruised by the ripple of unseen muscles. An elderly waiter"
635,IV,with trembling hands was hurriedly spreading a pink and white checked
636,IV,"cloth over the rusty green iron table, saying: “If the lady and"
637,IV,"gentleman wish to take their tea in the garden, if the lady and"
638,IV,gentleman wish to take their tea in the garden ...” I decided that
639,IV,"if the shaking of her breasts could be stopped, some of the fragments"
640,IV,"of the afternoon might be collected, and I concentrated my attention"
641,IV,with careful subtlety to this end.
642,IV,
643,IV,
644,IV,
645,IV,
646,IV,Conversation Galante
647,IV,
648,IV,I observe: “Our sentimental friend the moon
649,IV,"Or possibly (fantastic, I confess)"
650,IV,It may be Prester John’s balloon
651,IV,Or an old battered lantern hung aloft
652,IV,To light poor travellers to their distress.”
653,IV,She then: “How you digress!”
654,IV,
655,IV,And I then: “Some one frames upon the keys
656,IV,"That exquisite nocturne, with which we explain"
657,IV,The night and moonshine; music which we seize
658,IV,To body forth our own vacuity.”
659,IV,She then: “Does this refer to me?”
660,IV,"“Oh no, it is I who am inane.”"
661,IV,
662,IV,"“You, madam, are the eternal humorist"
663,IV,"The eternal enemy of the absolute,"
664,IV,Giving our vagrant moods the slightest twist
665,IV,With your air indifferent and imperious
666,IV,At a stroke our mad poetics to confute--”
667,IV,And--“Are we then so serious?”
668,IV,
669,IV,
670,IV,
671,IV,
672,IV,La Figlia Che Piange
673,IV,
674,IV,Stand on the highest pavement of the stair--
675,IV,Lean on a garden urn--
676,IV,"Weave, weave the sunlight in your hair--"
677,IV,Clasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise--
678,IV,Fling them to the ground and turn
679,IV,With a fugitive resentment in your eyes:
680,IV,"But weave, weave the sunlight in your hair."
681,IV,
682,IV,"So I would have had him leave,"
683,IV,"So I would have had her stand and grieve,"
684,IV,So he would have left
685,IV,As the soul leaves the body torn and bruised
686,IV,As the mind deserts the body it has used.
687,IV,I should find
688,IV,"Some way incomparably light and deft,"
689,IV,"Some way we both should understand,"
690,IV,Simple and faithless as a smile and shake of the hand.
691,IV,
692,IV,"She turned away, but with the autumn weather"
693,IV,"Compelled my imagination many days,"
694,IV,Many days and many hours:
695,IV,Her hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers.
696,IV,And I wonder how they should have been together!
697,IV,I should have lost a gesture and a pose.
698,IV,Sometimes these cogitations still amaze
699,IV,The troubled midnight and the noon’s repose.
