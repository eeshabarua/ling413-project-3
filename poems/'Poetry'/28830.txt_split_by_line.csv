287,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,With his right hand he skinked the wine and the mead
288,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,And cast with his left the Rune characters dread.
289,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
290,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"To cast them on Kirstin the gallant Stig meant,"
291,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,But under the dress of Rigissa they went.
292,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
293,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"O pallid as ashes the gallant Stig grew,"
294,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,And red as the blood was Rigissa to view.
295,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
296,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"The gallant Child Stig placed his cap on his head,"
297,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,And unto his foster dame's chamber he sped.

316,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
317,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""She'll tap on the door of thy chamber, I ween,"
318,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"But still do thou keep, let her in by no mean."
319,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
320,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""But ten fingers has she, so tiny and small,"
321,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,And with them from the door she will pick the nails all.
322,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
323,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""She will set herself down on the side of thy bed,"
324,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,And play with the long yellow locks of thy head.
325,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
326,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""So fondly she'll stroke thy fair cheek in the dark,"
327,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,But do thou remain as thou wert stiff and stark.
328,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
329,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""She'll kiss thee full oft on thy lips rosy red,"

331,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
332,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"Child Stig he gave ear to his foster dame's rede,"
333,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,And away to his bed he betook him with speed.
334,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
335,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"'Twas late in the even, and down fell the dew,"
336,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,Rigissa flung o'er her her mantle of blue.
337,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
338,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"The lovely maid she her blue mantle put on,"
339,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,And unto the chamber of Stig she is gone.
340,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
341,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,On the door of the chamber begins she to knock:
342,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""Arise, O Child Stig, and thy chamber unlock."""
343,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
344,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""At the Ting to appear, I have summoned no wight,"
345,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"And none I'll admit to my chamber at night."""
346,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
347,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"She's fingers, ten fingers, so tiny and small,"
348,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,And out of the door she has picked the nails all.
349,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
350,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"Fifteen iron nails, and a big stud of brass,"
351,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,Then into the chamber Rigissa could pass.
352,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
353,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"She sat herself down by the side of the bed,"
354,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,And played with the locks of the young gallant's head.
355,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
356,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"She kissed him full oft on his mouth rosy red,"
357,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,But still he remained as were life from him fled.
358,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
359,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"In her arms the young Stig she so fondly did press,"
360,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,But quiet he lay nor returned her caress.
361,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
362,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"Child Stig he awoke, and cast up his eyes:"
363,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""Who wakes me from sleep in this manner?"" he cries."

368,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""O thou may'st complain if thou feelest inclin'd,"
369,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"But thou art the man on whom standeth my mind."""
370,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
371,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"The very next morning ere high was the sun,"
372,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,Child Stig to complain to the Dane King is gone.
373,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
374,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""Dear Lord, I have this to complain of to thee,"
375,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"For thy sister at night I at rest cannot be."""
376,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
377,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,The King in displeasure his footboy address'd:
378,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""To come to my presence my sister request."""

380,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"Rigissa came in, 'fore the table stood she:"
381,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""What mean'st thou, O brother, by sending for me?"""
382,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
383,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""O here is a knight doth complaint of thee make,"
384,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"He cannot at night his repose for thee take."""
385,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
386,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""It is but God's truth that his chamber I sought,"
387,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,But nothing unseemly betwixt us was wrought.
388,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
389,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""Steel, glowing steel, I will bear on my hand,"
390,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"And of crime with Child Stig I acquitted will stand."""
391,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
392,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"Long stood the Dane King, full of thought was his head:"
393,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""With no better man I my sister can wed."""
394,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
395,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"All hearts in the Dane King's palace were gay,"
396,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,The Dane King has given his sister away.
397,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
398,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"There was pleasure and smiling in every look,"
399,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,For his beloved Lady Child Stig the maid took.

408,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""Methinks I behold of Child Stig the abode."""
409,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
410,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,And thereto the page at her bridle replied:
411,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""Of Stig the brave castle is known far and wide."
412,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
413,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""Within with the richest of gold it is graced,"

415,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,
416,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"And, lo, when the gate of the castle they gained,"
417,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,Five shaggy white bears stood before it enchained.
