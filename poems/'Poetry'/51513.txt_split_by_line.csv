257,GOOD-BYE,
258,GOOD-BYE,"Good-bye, yes, I’ve decided"
259,GOOD-BYE,"It’s best--it should not go _on_,"
260,GOOD-BYE,The quite delightful companionship
261,GOOD-BYE,"You and I, for some time, have known."
262,GOOD-BYE,
263,GOOD-BYE,"No, do not try to dissuade me,"
264,GOOD-BYE,"I’ve thought it most carefully o’er,"
265,GOOD-BYE,To arrive at but one conviction--
266,GOOD-BYE,We must see each other no more.
267,GOOD-BYE,
268,GOOD-BYE,
269,GOOD-BYE,_He_
270,GOOD-BYE,
271,GOOD-BYE,And you think to sever our friendship
272,GOOD-BYE,"By a mere putting away,"
273,GOOD-BYE,"Letting the same, as it were, slip from us"
274,GOOD-BYE,"Nor permitting me to say,"
275,GOOD-BYE,
276,GOOD-BYE,A word in defence of its going
277,GOOD-BYE,As if I’d no _right_ to share
278,GOOD-BYE,In the matter of decision
279,GOOD-BYE,"I ask you,--Is it fair?"
280,GOOD-BYE,
281,GOOD-BYE,
282,GOOD-BYE,
283,GOOD-BYE,
284,GOOD-BYE,_She_
285,GOOD-BYE,
286,GOOD-BYE,Man-like you refuse to _reason_
287,GOOD-BYE,"To see it’s the only way,"
288,GOOD-BYE,That the step really should have been taken
289,GOOD-BYE,Even _before_ to-day.
290,GOOD-BYE,
291,GOOD-BYE,"With you ’tis quite diff’rent,--the matter,--"
292,GOOD-BYE,You’ve priv’lege entire of your life;
293,GOOD-BYE,"But my freedom bows to restriction,--"
294,GOOD-BYE,I am another man’s wife.
295,GOOD-BYE,
296,GOOD-BYE,
297,GOOD-BYE,_He_
298,GOOD-BYE,
299,GOOD-BYE,"Yes, another man’s wife, but the honor"
300,GOOD-BYE,"The Fates have conferred, it would seem"
301,GOOD-BYE,"He doesn’t the quite appreciate,--"
302,GOOD-BYE,"At least, ’tis the knowledge I gleam."
303,GOOD-BYE,
304,GOOD-BYE,"From observing his attitude towards you,"
305,GOOD-BYE,"Which I’m sure,--and you can but agree,"
306,GOOD-BYE,Is not in the least in keeping with what
307,GOOD-BYE,A husband’s towards a wife _should_ be.
308,GOOD-BYE,
309,GOOD-BYE,
310,GOOD-BYE,
311,GOOD-BYE,
312,GOOD-BYE,_She_
313,GOOD-BYE,
314,GOOD-BYE,And his failing you think permits me
315,GOOD-BYE,"Favor to accept at _your_ hands,"
316,GOOD-BYE,That the vow I took at the altar
317,GOOD-BYE,Ceases to impose its demands.
318,GOOD-BYE,
319,GOOD-BYE,"In sickness or health I promised,"
320,GOOD-BYE,"“For better or worse”,--till the day,"
321,GOOD-BYE,He who gave should in his judgment
322,GOOD-BYE,See fit to take away.
323,GOOD-BYE,
324,GOOD-BYE,
325,GOOD-BYE,_He_
326,GOOD-BYE,
327,GOOD-BYE,"And you’ll let it bind you, that promise,"
328,GOOD-BYE,To a man who does not care;
329,GOOD-BYE,"Whose int’rest is the thoroughly selfish,"
330,GOOD-BYE,"In whose secrets--you do not share,"
331,GOOD-BYE,
332,GOOD-BYE,"Listen, dear, the priv’lege of Mortals,--"
333,GOOD-BYE,To get what we can out of life.
334,GOOD-BYE,Free yourself from the bond that is irksome
335,GOOD-BYE,"And find happiness, as my wife."
336,GOOD-BYE,
337,GOOD-BYE,
338,GOOD-BYE,
339,GOOD-BYE,
340,GOOD-BYE,_She_
341,GOOD-BYE,
342,GOOD-BYE,"Nay, not so, the rule of living"
343,GOOD-BYE,Holds faithful but to the one test;
344,GOOD-BYE,"Nor counts it--another’s transgression,"
345,GOOD-BYE,We must give of _ourselves_--our best.
346,GOOD-BYE,
347,GOOD-BYE,"Of no use to appeal the exception,"
348,GOOD-BYE,"The truth remains fix’ed alway,"
349,GOOD-BYE,"So, good-bye, it _must_ be,--and, God bless you,--"
350,GOOD-BYE,_There is nothing more to say_.

357,THE WONDROUS SONG,
358,THE WONDROUS SONG,"I longed to sing a wondrous song,"
359,THE WONDROUS SONG,"So wondrous, ’twould compel"
360,THE WONDROUS SONG,The admiration unreserved
361,THE WONDROUS SONG,Of one and all as well.
362,THE WONDROUS SONG,
363,THE WONDROUS SONG,My pen I took in hand and strove
364,THE WONDROUS SONG,"The magic words to write,"
365,THE WONDROUS SONG,Alas! I could not of my Muse
366,THE WONDROUS SONG,Inspiration invite.
367,THE WONDROUS SONG,
368,THE WONDROUS SONG,"She would not humor, tho’ I begged"
369,THE WONDROUS SONG,Persistently and long
370,THE WONDROUS SONG,"For the right metre--the right thought,"
371,THE WONDROUS SONG,To best set down my song.
372,THE WONDROUS SONG,
373,THE WONDROUS SONG,"’Twas stately phrase I coveted,"
374,THE WONDROUS SONG,The Laurel I would court--
375,THE WONDROUS SONG,That of the world’s acknowledgment
376,THE WONDROUS SONG,Of unsurpass´ed thought.
377,THE WONDROUS SONG,
378,THE WONDROUS SONG,"At length disheartened, my appeal"
379,THE WONDROUS SONG,"Knew, but to be denied,"
380,THE WONDROUS SONG,"I rose and to the window moved,"
381,THE WONDROUS SONG,And marked the scene outside.
382,THE WONDROUS SONG,
383,THE WONDROUS SONG,"All quiet stretched the land before,"
384,THE WONDROUS SONG,Enwrapt in the soft haze
385,THE WONDROUS SONG,Which with such rare enchantment clothes
386,THE WONDROUS SONG,Autumn’s initial days.
387,THE WONDROUS SONG,
388,THE WONDROUS SONG,Idly my glance the expanse swept
389,THE WONDROUS SONG,Till it came to where lay
390,THE WONDROUS SONG,"Outside the gate, the winding road"
391,THE WONDROUS SONG,Leading to far-away.
392,THE WONDROUS SONG,
393,THE WONDROUS SONG,Then with the moment light was mine--
394,THE WONDROUS SONG,"Yet not complex its thought,"
395,THE WONDROUS SONG,The inspiration which appealed
396,THE WONDROUS SONG,"Was diff’rent, from that sought."
397,THE WONDROUS SONG,
398,THE WONDROUS SONG,The winding road--the simple theme--
399,THE WONDROUS SONG,They who followed after--
400,THE WONDROUS SONG,"The toll it wrested of sad tears,"
401,THE WONDROUS SONG,For short dole of laughter.
402,THE WONDROUS SONG,
403,THE WONDROUS SONG,"The tranquil ways bidden farewell,"
404,THE WONDROUS SONG,"To seek of its unrest,"
405,THE WONDROUS SONG,"The truth alas! too oft brought home,"
406,THE WONDROUS SONG,"The paths forsook, were best."
407,THE WONDROUS SONG,
408,THE WONDROUS SONG,"Could I but so compose a lay,"
409,THE WONDROUS SONG,"That one who heard might pause,"
410,THE WONDROUS SONG,Nor continue to sacrifice
411,THE WONDROUS SONG,In an unrighteous cause.
412,THE WONDROUS SONG,
413,THE WONDROUS SONG,And keep his soul tho’ it should be
414,THE WONDROUS SONG,"By cruelest conflict wrung,"
415,THE WONDROUS SONG,I need not further supplicate--
416,THE WONDROUS SONG,My wondrous song were sung.

424,MILADI,Miladi is so wonderful in furbelows and laces;
425,MILADI,Miladi is so wonderful of such beguiling graces;
426,MILADI,My poor faint heart goes pit-a-pat when she her Slave addresses
427,MILADI,"I wonder if how _much_ I love, Miladi guesses!"
428,MILADI,
429,MILADI,"Miladi is so wonderful, her dimples and her curls;"
430,MILADI,"Miladi is so wonderful, my mind bewildered whirls;"
431,MILADI,Oh would some pow’r benign might make it plain for me to see
432,MILADI,"How much it is, in very truth, Miladi thinks of _me_."

441,THE SOMETHING MY LIFE HAS MISSED,"Of the breezes passing by,"
442,THE SOMETHING MY LIFE HAS MISSED,Pulsates in the azure
443,THE SOMETHING MY LIFE HAS MISSED,Of ev’ry flawless sky.

944,RE-ADJUSTMENT,
945,RE-ADJUSTMENT,And you the while were betraying

988,WHEN GRANDMAMA WAS LITTLE,"The way all children should,"
989,WHEN GRANDMAMA WAS LITTLE,"And never interrupt a bit,"
990,WHEN GRANDMAMA WAS LITTLE,Or question ’bout the rest

993,WHEN GRANDMAMA WAS LITTLE,
994,WHEN GRANDMAMA WAS LITTLE,I can’t begin to tell you
995,WHEN GRANDMAMA WAS LITTLE,The half of what is there:
996,WHEN GRANDMAMA WAS LITTLE,The rag-dolls soiled and faded
997,WHEN GRANDMAMA WAS LITTLE,"That haven’t any hair,"
998,WHEN GRANDMAMA WAS LITTLE,"And toys, and--oh, yes!--lady-dolls,"
999,WHEN GRANDMAMA WAS LITTLE,"And, folded with the rest,"
1000,WHEN GRANDMAMA WAS LITTLE,"A little rose-bud muslin frock,"
1001,WHEN GRANDMAMA WAS LITTLE,Her one-time very best.
1002,WHEN GRANDMAMA WAS LITTLE,

1005,WHEN GRANDMAMA WAS LITTLE,With ruffles reaching to the waist
1006,WHEN GRANDMAMA WAS LITTLE,And panties showing down;
1007,WHEN GRANDMAMA WAS LITTLE,Hair parted in the middle;

1167,THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,I want so much to cry right out--
1168,THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,But I am awful ’fraid!
1169,THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,"’Cause, if those black things _were_ about,"
1170,THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,They’d hear the noise I made.
1171,THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,"And mother sleeps so very sound,"
1172,THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,"She mightn’t hear, you see,"
1173,THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,And then they’d make a great big bound
1174,THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,And run away with me.
