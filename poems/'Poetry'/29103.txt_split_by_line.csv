34,INTRODUCTION,_Borrow and the Kjaempeviser_.
35,INTRODUCTION,
36,INTRODUCTION,
37,INTRODUCTION,The modern poetical literature of Denmark opens with a collection of
38,INTRODUCTION,"epical and lyrical poems from the Middle Ages, which are loosely"
39,INTRODUCTION,connected under the title of _Kjaempeviser_ or Heroic Ballads.  Of these
40,INTRODUCTION,"the latest scholarship recognises nearly 500, but in the time of Borrow"
41,INTRODUCTION,the number did not much exceed 200.  These ballads deal with
42,INTRODUCTION,"half-historic events, which are so completely masked by fantastic,"
43,INTRODUCTION,supernatural and incoherent imagery that their positive relation to
44,INTRODUCTION,"history can rarely be discovered.  Nevertheless, they throw a very"
45,INTRODUCTION,"valuable light upon the manners of mediaeval society in Scandinavia, and"
46,INTRODUCTION,they are often of high poetical beauty.  No conjecture can be formed as
47,INTRODUCTION,"to the authors of these ballads, and even the centuries in which they"
48,INTRODUCTION,"were composed are uncertain.  Grimm believed them to be _uralt_, and"
49,INTRODUCTION,"attributed them to the 5th and 6th centuries.  But on linguistic grounds,"
50,INTRODUCTION,this extreme antiquity cannot be maintained.  It is now supposed that
51,INTRODUCTION,"they were composed at various times between 1300 and 1500, and that in"
52,INTRODUCTION,their present form they bear the stamp of the period when they were first
53,INTRODUCTION,collected by the Danish antiquaries of the sixteenth century.
54,INTRODUCTION,
55,INTRODUCTION,The circumstances in which this famous collection of folk-songs came into
56,INTRODUCTION,"public notice were of a romantic nature.  Sophia, Queen of Denmark, when"
57,INTRODUCTION,"sailing across the Sound in the year 1586, was driven by stress of"
58,INTRODUCTION,"weather to take shelter in the little island-harbour of Hveen, where the"
59,INTRODUCTION,"famous observatory stood, close by the house of the astronomer, Tycho"
60,INTRODUCTION,Brahe.  It so happened that at that very time Brahe was entertaining as a
61,INTRODUCTION,"guest the most eminent Danish man of letters of that age, Anders Sorensen"
62,INTRODUCTION,"Vedel (1542-1616).  Vedel, whose labours were encyclopaedic, was engaged"
63,INTRODUCTION,in preserving all the monuments of Danish mediaeval history and learning
64,INTRODUCTION,which he could discover in the monasteries and libraries of Denmark.  He
65,INTRODUCTION,"had been much encouraged in this work by the Monk of Roeskilde, Peder"
66,INTRODUCTION,"Olufsen, who on his death-bed, about 1570, had placed in Vedel's hands"
67,INTRODUCTION,"all the MSS. which he had collected.  Queen Sophia, cloistered in the"
68,INTRODUCTION,"Ouranienborg with her antiquary and her astronomer, and waiting for the"
69,INTRODUCTION,"tempest to moderate, desired to be amused with stories of her national"
70,INTRODUCTION,history.  Vedel ventured to read to her some of the legendary poems which
71,INTRODUCTION,"still lingered among the people, and she was so enchanted with them, that"
72,INTRODUCTION,"she commanded him, when he returned to the mainland, to make a collection"
73,INTRODUCTION,of these ballads and publish them.
74,INTRODUCTION,
75,INTRODUCTION,"Accordingly, in 1591, Vedel issued from the private printing-press in his"
76,INTRODUCTION,"house called Liljeborg at Ribe in Jutland, a selection of 100 mediaeval"
77,INTRODUCTION,"ballads, under the title of _Et Hundred udvalgte danske Viser_.  This"
78,INTRODUCTION,"volume is one of the landmarks of Scandinavian, and indeed of European,"
79,INTRODUCTION,"literary history.  Vedel made another collection, this time of ancient"
80,INTRODUCTION,"love-ballads, which he called _Tragica_; it was not published until 1657,"
81,INTRODUCTION,long after his death.  But the volume of 1591 is the fountain-head of all
82,INTRODUCTION,"that has since been written about the Heroic Ballads of the North, and it"
83,INTRODUCTION,is impossible to overrate the services of Vedel in preserving what was
84,INTRODUCTION,"even then ready to disappear.  It seems, moreover, that he was careful of"
85,INTRODUCTION,"the text, and later scholarship has come more and more to place"
86,INTRODUCTION,confidence in his transcripts.
87,INTRODUCTION,
88,INTRODUCTION,"This was, unfortunately, not the case with the next pioneer in the same"
89,INTRODUCTION,"field, although he deserves great credit also.  Peter Petersen Syv"
90,INTRODUCTION,"(1631-1702) was a very able philologist, who was also a minor poet of"
91,INTRODUCTION,"ambition.  In 1695 he reprinted and edited Vedel's text, adding 100 more"
92,INTRODUCTION,_kjaempeviser_ which had been unknown to Vedel.  But his work was not so
93,INTRODUCTION,"well done; Syv was something of a pedant, and unfortunately either too"
94,INTRODUCTION,critical or not critical enough.  He ventured to correct the
95,INTRODUCTION,"irregularities of the ballads, and not seldom has spoiled them.  He bore"
96,INTRODUCTION,"the proud title of Philologer Royal of Denmark, and he was above all"
97,INTRODUCTION,"things else a grammarian.  But he added to our store of Ballads.  No one,"
98,INTRODUCTION,"during the eighteenth century, advanced on the labours of Vedel and Syv,"
99,INTRODUCTION,and their treasuries of beautiful anonymous poetry seem to have attracted
100,INTRODUCTION,no attention in the rest of Europe.
101,INTRODUCTION,
102,INTRODUCTION,"But in the first decade of the nineteenth century, in consequence of what"
103,INTRODUCTION,"we call the Romantic Revival, poets and scholars in many countries turned"
104,INTRODUCTION,simultaneously to the treasure-house of Danish balladry.  Jamieson's
105,INTRODUCTION,"work, to which I shall presently return, dates from 1806; about the same"
106,INTRODUCTION,time Herder translated one or two _kjaempeviser_ in his _Stimmen der
107,INTRODUCTION,"Volker_, and in 1809 Wilhelm Carl Grimm started his full translation,"
108,INTRODUCTION,"under the title of _Altdanische Heldenlieder_, _Balladen and Marchen_,"
109,INTRODUCTION,which appeared in 1811.  But it appears that Grimm had heard and perhaps
110,INTRODUCTION,"even seen the proofs of a Danish edition of the very highest importance,"
111,INTRODUCTION,"the _Udvalgte Danske Viser fra Middlealderen_, the first volume of which"
112,INTRODUCTION,"was brought out by Abrahamson, Nyerup and Rahbek in 1812. {9}  Abrahamson"
113,INTRODUCTION,"dropped out, but the work was completed by the others, the fifth and last"
114,INTRODUCTION,volume appearing in 1814.
115,INTRODUCTION,
116,INTRODUCTION,"Borrow's relation to these texts must now be considered, and it offers"
117,INTRODUCTION,some difficulty.  In 1826 he published a volume of verse entitled
118,INTRODUCTION,"_Romantic Ballads translated from the Danish_, and in the preface he uses"
119,INTRODUCTION,"these words:--""I expect shortly to lay before the public a complete"
120,INTRODUCTION,"translation of the KIAEMPE VISER, made by me some years ago.""  It is"
121,INTRODUCTION,necessary to bear in mind that there are these two collections of
122,INTRODUCTION,"Borrow's translations from the _kjaempeviser_, the second of which, as we"
123,INTRODUCTION,"shall see, he did not contrive to publish."
124,INTRODUCTION,
125,INTRODUCTION,"No doubt, he was anxious to emphasise the novelty and rarity of his"
126,INTRODUCTION,literary adventures.  But his attitude to Jamieson is very strange.  As
127,INTRODUCTION,early as 1806 Robert Jamieson (1780-1844) had published a volume of
128,INTRODUCTION,"_Popular Ballads_, in which he had translated several of the"
129,INTRODUCTION,_kjaempeviser_ and had pointed out their value in relation to the ancient
130,INTRODUCTION,Scottish poems of a similar kind.  Sir Walter Scott paid much flattering
131,INTRODUCTION,"attention to Jamieson's work, which also attracted a good deal of notice"
132,INTRODUCTION,"in Denmark and Germany, and inspired the _Drei altschottische Lieder_ of"
133,INTRODUCTION,G. D. Grater (1813).  It is scarcely possible that Borrow was not aware
134,INTRODUCTION,"of all this, yet he never mentions the name of Jamieson, and in 1826 he"
135,INTRODUCTION,"spoke boldly of himself as breaking into ""unknown and untrodden paths."""
136,INTRODUCTION,It is not impossible that Sir Walter Scott's patronage of Jamieson had
137,INTRODUCTION,something to do with the ungenerous petulance of Borrow's references to
138,INTRODUCTION,the great novelist in _Lavengro_.
139,INTRODUCTION,
140,INTRODUCTION,But Borrow's attitude to the contemporary scholars of Denmark is still
141,INTRODUCTION,"more surprising.  Without saying so in exact words, he gives us to"
142,INTRODUCTION,understand that he translated all the _kjaempeviser_ from the original
143,INTRODUCTION,edition of Vedel.  It would be rash to say that Borrow was not acquainted
144,INTRODUCTION,"with the _Danske Viser_ of 1591, for he does, in one place, quote,"
145,INTRODUCTION,"whether at first-hand or not, from Vedel's preface.  But it requires"
146,INTRODUCTION,great faith to accept his own account of his approach to the poems.  In
147,INTRODUCTION,"_Lavengro_, at a point which Knapp has dated 1820, Borrow tells with"
148,INTRODUCTION,"brilliant picturesqueness how he purchased, by permitting the wife of an"
149,INTRODUCTION,"elderly yeoman to kiss his cheek, ""a strange and uncouth-looking volume"""
150,INTRODUCTION,which had formed part of the kit of some red-haired fishermen who were
151,INTRODUCTION,wrecked on the Norfolk coast:--
152,INTRODUCTION,
153,INTRODUCTION,"It was not very large, but instead of the usual covering was bound in"
154,INTRODUCTION,"wood, and was compassed with strong iron clasps.  It was a printed"
155,INTRODUCTION,"book, but the pages were not of paper, but vellum, and the characters"
156,INTRODUCTION,"were black, and resembled those generally termed Gothic. . . .  And"
157,INTRODUCTION,"now I had in my possession a Danish book, which, from its appearance,"
158,INTRODUCTION,might be supposed to have belonged to the very old Danes indeed: but
159,INTRODUCTION,"how was I to turn it to any account?  I had the book it is true, but"
160,INTRODUCTION,"I did not understand the language, and how was I to overcome that"
161,INTRODUCTION,difficulty?  Hardly by poring over the book; yet I did pore over the
162,INTRODUCTION,"book again, but with all my poring I could not understand it; and"
163,INTRODUCTION,"then I became angry, and I bit my lips till the blood came; and I"
164,INTRODUCTION,"occasionally tore a handful from my hair and flung it upon the floor,"
165,INTRODUCTION,"but that did not mend the matter, for still I did not understand the"
166,INTRODUCTION,"book, which however I began to see was written in rhyme. . . .  For"
167,INTRODUCTION,"the book was a book of ballads, about the deeds of knights and"
168,INTRODUCTION,"champions, and men of huge stature. . . . collected by one Anders"
169,INTRODUCTION,Vedel.
170,INTRODUCTION,
171,INTRODUCTION,This story of a vellum copy of the rare edition of 1591 thrown up on the
172,INTRODUCTION,shore of Norfolk with a common sailor's effects is told in Borrow's best
173,INTRODUCTION,style.  But how far is it true?  Whether it is entirely or only partly
174,INTRODUCTION,"romance, the inference that Borrow translated the _kjaempeviser_ by the"
175,INTRODUCTION,"light of nature from this ""Gothic"" text must be abandoned.  He may or may"
176,INTRODUCTION,"not have handled a copy of Vedel, but he made his translations, as"
177,INTRODUCTION,"internal evidence amply proves, from the five volumes of Abrahamson,"
178,INTRODUCTION,"Nyerup and Rahbek, published between 1812 and 1814.  This was a cheap and"
179,INTRODUCTION,"highly accessible edition, and was in the hands of the booksellers"
180,INTRODUCTION,complete at least six years before Borrow began to read Danish.  He
181,INTRODUCTION,accepted the text of these scholars and their arrangement; he translated
182,INTRODUCTION,"their notes word for word,--and gave them out as his own; his volume of"
183,INTRODUCTION,1826 and the privately printed later ballads are wholly founded upon
184,INTRODUCTION,"Abrahamson, Nyerup and Rahbek, and yet, so far as I can discover, he"
185,INTRODUCTION,never mentions their names in any part of his writings.  He professed
186,INTRODUCTION,that the public should believe his knowledge to be wholly derived from a
187,INTRODUCTION,mysterious black-letter volume washed up on the sands of his native
188,INTRODUCTION,"county, and read by him with agonies of labour by the pure light of"
189,INTRODUCTION,divination.
190,INTRODUCTION,
191,INTRODUCTION,"In January, 1830, a prospectus was put forth in which ""_The Songs of"
192,INTRODUCTION,"Scandinavia_, _translated by Dr. Bowring and Mr. Borrow_"" was offered to"
193,INTRODUCTION,subscribers at the price of a guinea.  This was an attempt on the part of
194,INTRODUCTION,"Borrow, languidly assented to by Bowring, to give publicity to some 70"
195,INTRODUCTION,_kjaempeviser_ which the former had translated since the publication of
196,INTRODUCTION,"his _Romantic Ballads_ of 1826.  ""I am terribly afraid,"" writes Borrow,"
197,INTRODUCTION,"""of being forestalled in the Kaempe Viser by some of those Scotch"
198,INTRODUCTION,"blackguards,"" a hit, no doubt, at Jamieson.  He was working hard at his"
199,INTRODUCTION,"translations, and he was further stimulated by meeting in London with the"
200,INTRODUCTION,"Danish theologian and poetical student, Nikolai Frederik Severin"
201,INTRODUCTION,"Grundtvig, who had done much to popularise the _kjaempeviser_ in his"
202,INTRODUCTION,"native country.  But Bowring proved a broken reed, and Borrow suffered"
203,INTRODUCTION,once again one of those disappointments which so naturally embittered
204,INTRODUCTION,"him.  It was not until 1874, however, some seven years before his death,"
205,INTRODUCTION,that he finally gave up all hope.  The MSS. of his translations of the
206,INTRODUCTION,_kjaempeviser_ passed into the hands of Mrs. MacOubrey.
207,INTRODUCTION,
208,INTRODUCTION,The ballad of _Grimhild's Vengeance_ (_Grimhilds Hevn_) is given in three
209,INTRODUCTION,"versions by Abrahamson, Nyerup and Rahbek.  Borrow has closely followed"
210,INTRODUCTION,the editors of 1812 and has translated each of the versions.  He added a
211,INTRODUCTION,"number of notes, the MS. of which is mutilated, but not so much so as to"
212,INTRODUCTION,prevent us from observing that these are translated word for word from
213,INTRODUCTION,"the appendix of Abrahamson, Nyerup and Rahbek, but, so far as can be"
214,INTRODUCTION,"discerned from the fragmentary and mutilated Manuscripts at our disposal,"
215,INTRODUCTION,without a sign of acknowledgment.

230,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
231,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,She bade them come and not delay
232,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,To tournament and strife;
233,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,It was the Hero Hogen
234,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Who lost his youthful life.

236,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,It was the Hero Hogen

241,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"""Now hail, thou maiden of the sea,"

250,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
251,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"It was the Hero Hogen,"
252,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"He straight drew forth his blade,"
253,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,And he struck off at a single blow
254,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,The head of the ocean-maid.
255,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
256,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Then out amid the Sound he cast
257,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,The head all dropping gore;
258,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"The body rolled down after it,"
259,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,In the deep they joined once more.

261,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"It was the Hero Hogen,"

279,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,The head of the Ferry-carl.

290,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
291,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"So furious then the weather was,"
292,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"So wild the waters grew,"
293,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Asunder soon in Hogen's hand
294,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,The oar of iron flew.
295,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
296,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,The iron oar asunder flew
297,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"In Hero Hogen's hand,"

299,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,The heroes steered to land.
300,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
301,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,They 'gan to scour their faulchions

306,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"O she was slender at the waist,"
307,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,And just of proper height;

309,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,And maidenlike her gait.
310,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,

365,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
366,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"Then answered her a warrior,"
367,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,A baron of that land:
368,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"""O I will earn the prize this day,"
369,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Forsooth with this good hand.
370,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
371,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"""O I will do the doughty deed,"

375,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
376,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"Then answered Folker Spillemand,"

378,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"""I'll set my mark upon thee, knave,"
379,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"Before thou scap'st from here."""
380,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
381,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,And at the first blow he has laid
382,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Full fifteen warriors low:
383,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"""Ha bravely, Folker Spillemand,"
384,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"You touch your fiddle bow!"""
385,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
386,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"He smote to death the warriors,"
387,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,A bridge of them he made;
388,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"And broad and long I ween it was,"
389,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Full rough with them he play'd.
390,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
391,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"Above were laid the oxen hides,"
392,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Below the pease so small;
393,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"That trick has vanquished Hogen,"
394,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,He fell down first of all.
395,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
396,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,It was the Hero Hogen
397,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Would have bounded up with speed:
398,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"""No, no, desist, my brother,"
399,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Thou know'st what was agreed.

404,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"You'd never rise up more."""
405,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
406,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,So brave was Hero Hogen
407,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,To his word he true was found;
408,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"Upon his two knees stood he then,"
409,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,And got his mortal wound.
410,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
411,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"But still three warriors slaughtered he,"
412,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"They were not of the least,"
413,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Towards Hammeren went he then to find
414,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,His father's treasure-chest.
415,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
416,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"Fortune was yet to him so kind,"
417,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,The damsel proud he won;
418,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"And she was haughty Hvenild,"
419,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,He begot with her a son.
420,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
421,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"That gallant son, hight Ranke,"
422,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Avenged his father well;
423,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Grimhild entombed by Niflung's gold
424,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Of hunger-pain did yell.
425,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
426,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Then soon from out the land to Bern
427,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,In Lombardy he strayed;
428,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"And there 'mongst Danish men he was,"
429,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,And prowess high displayed.

721,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,All on the yellow sand;
722,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"It was the Hero Hogen,"
723,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,He stepped the first to land.
724,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
725,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"The others they did not delay,"
726,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,But each as he could best
727,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"Arrayed himself right manfully,"
728,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,And Folker 'bove the rest.
729,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
730,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"Abroad the warden standing was,"
731,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,He on the rampart strode:
732,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"""O, there are come our country to,"
733,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Two Athelings so proud.
734,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
735,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"""O kemps are come our country to,"
736,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,And men so bold to see;
737,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"They all yclad in iron are,"
738,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Their steeds come springing free.
739,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
740,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"""The one he bears a hawk in flight,"
741,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Gold on his buckler gleams;
742,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"The other bears a fiddle, and"
743,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"A prince's son he seems."""
744,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
745,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"Out came she, Dame Grimhild,"
746,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,She so fair to speak was able:
747,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"""He does not bear a fiddle"
748,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,For he serves a noble's table.
749,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
750,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"""But they two gallant warriors are,"
751,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Two sprouts of Dukely tree;
752,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"To know them I have cause enough,"
753,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"They brothers are to me."""
754,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
755,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"It was the Count Sir Gunselin,"
756,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,His warriors he bespake:
757,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"""O, hither Hero Hogen comes,"
758,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,A fray with him we'll make.
759,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
760,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"""O, we will fight with them to-day,"
761,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,And we will slay them all;
762,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Then his red gold and forest green
763,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"Shall in our power fall."""
764,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
765,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Then just within the portal
766,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Hero Hogen answer made:
767,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"""With you I'll blythely hazard that,"
768,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"If ye be not afraid."""
769,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
770,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"Out then went the heroes all,"
771,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,So sorely fast they hied;
772,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Then unto old as well as young
773,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Such evil did betide.
774,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
775,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,In hand of Folker Spillemand
776,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,The sword asunder flew;
777,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"He seized a big steel spear, above"
778,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,The door that met his view.
779,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
780,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,And seven such gallant warriors
781,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,He slew at the first blow:
782,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"""In Drotten's holy name,"" he said,"
783,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"""My fiddle be known now."
784,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
785,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"""Now merrily my fiddle goes,"
786,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Ye dance and spring around;
787,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,I sweat with strong exertion
788,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"In my acton narrow bound."""
789,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
790,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"It was the Count Sir Gunselin,"
791,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,At Grimhild's feet he kneeled:
792,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"""O part us from those hardy knights,"
793,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"Or help against them yield."""
794,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
795,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"""Fight on, fight on, my good men all,"
796,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,On whom I bread bestow;
797,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,From fighting ye must not desist
798,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"Till Folker lyeth low."""
799,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
800,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"""Now hear thou, Sister Grimhild,"
801,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,I am gored with many a wound;
802,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"Thou ne'er to me wert true or good,"
803,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,And that I now have found.
804,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
805,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"""Now I've not closed an eye, an eye"
806,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,For days and nights full seven;
807,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,I'll avenge my murder certainly
808,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Ere life from me is riven.
809,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
810,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"""Gone is my sword so trusty,"
811,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,And my good steel spear's in twain;
812,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,But all my care I would forget
813,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"Could I a weapon gain."""
814,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
815,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"Then answered him young Hubba Yern,"
816,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,He stood by him so near:
817,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"""I'll lend to thee the gallant sword,"
818,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,My brother loved so dear.
819,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
820,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"""Methink thou art a hero bold,"
821,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,And mighty strong beside;
822,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,And that maybe in verity
823,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"On thy fiddle bow espied."""
824,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
825,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"""Ah, thanks to thee, young Hubba Yern!"
826,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,A true kemp thee I call;
827,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"I'll serve thee faithful in return,"
828,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"So shall my brothers all."""
829,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,
830,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,"Then hewed he, Folker Spillemand,"
831,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,'Twas heard up to the sky;
832,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,He'd rather perish like a man
833,GRIMHILD'S VENGEANCE,Than basely quit and fly.
