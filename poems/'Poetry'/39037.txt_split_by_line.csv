48,PREFACE.,
49,PREFACE.,"Every person, who can be said to really live at all, leads two lives"
50,PREFACE.,during this period of mortal existence. The one life is outward; it is
51,PREFACE.,passed in reading the thoughts of others; in contemplating the
52,PREFACE.,"struggles, the defeats, the victories, the virtues, the sins, in fine,"
53,PREFACE.,all things which make the history of those who surround us; and in
54,PREFACE.,"gazing upon the structures which Art has reared, or paintings which she"
55,PREFACE.,hath inscribed on the canvas; or looking upon the grand temple of the
56,PREFACE.,"material universe, and beholding scenes painted by a hand more skilled,"
57,PREFACE.,"more wondrous, in its creative power, than ever can be human hand. The"
58,PREFACE.,"life passed in examining what other minds have produced, or living other"
59,PREFACE.,"men's lives by looking at their deeds, or in any way discerning what"
60,PREFACE.,"addresses the bodily eye or the physical ear,--this is often wise and"
61,PREFACE.,"well; essential, indeed, to any inner life; but it is outward, not"
62,PREFACE.,"self-centred, not the product of our own individual natures."
63,PREFACE.,
64,PREFACE.,But the thought of others suggests or develops thought of our own--the
65,PREFACE.,"history of other men, as it is writing itself imperishably every day"
66,PREFACE.,"upon their souls, or already has written itself in letters of living"
67,PREFACE.,light or lines of gloomy blackness--gives rise to internal sympathy or
68,PREFACE.,abhorrence on the part of us who look on and read what is thus writing
69,PREFACE.,"and written. Our own spirits are stirred within us: our passions, which"
70,PREFACE.,"have been sleeping lions, our affections and aspirations, before angels"
71,PREFACE.,"with folded wings,--these are awakened by what others are doing, and"
72,PREFACE.,then we struggle with the bad or yield to it; we obey or disobey the
73,PREFACE.,"good, and our internal moral life begins; the outward universe or the"
74,PREFACE.,"Great Spirit in our hearts speaks to our souls, leading first to inward"
75,PREFACE.,"dissatisfaction, then to aspiration for and attainment of holiness, and"
76,PREFACE.,"now the inner spiritual life, which shall transfigure all outward life,"
77,PREFACE.,and throw its own light and give its own hue to all the outward
78,PREFACE.,"universe, has begun. These two lives are parallel streams; often they"
79,PREFACE.,"mingle their waters, and each imparts its own hue and characteristic to"
80,PREFACE.,the other. Sometimes the outer life is the main stream; men live only in
81,PREFACE.,"other men's thoughts and deeds--look only upon the material universe,"
82,PREFACE.,and retire but seldom within: the inner life is but a silver thread--a
83,PREFACE.,"little rill, scarce discoverable save by the eye of God. Again, with"
84,PREFACE.,"many the outer life is but little; the passing scene, the din of the"
85,PREFACE.,"battle which humanity is ever waging, the one scarce is gazed upon or"
86,PREFACE.,"the other heard by those who retire much from the outward world, and"
87,PREFACE.,"live almost exclusively upon their own thoughts, and in an ideal realm"
88,PREFACE.,"of fancy, or a real one of internal conflict, which is hidden from the"
89,PREFACE.,outer vision. Better is it when the stream of outward and inner life are
90,PREFACE.,both full and broad--when the glories of the material universe attract
91,PREFACE.,"the gaze, the realm of literature and learning invite the willing feet"
92,PREFACE.,"to wander in paths where poetry has planted many flowers, philosophy"
93,PREFACE.,"many a sturdy oak of truth, which centuries cannot overthrow--and when,"
94,PREFACE.,"on the other hand, men do not forget to retire often within, and find"
95,PREFACE.,"their own minds kingdoms, where many a noble thought spontaneously"
96,PREFACE.,"grows; their own souls heavens, where, the busy world withdrawn, they"
97,PREFACE.,"commune much with their own aspirations, fight many a noble battle with"
98,PREFACE.,"whatever hinders their spiritual peace, and where they commune yet more"
99,PREFACE.,"with that Comforter, the Divine Spirit, and Christ, that Friend and"
100,PREFACE.,"Helper of all who are seeking to make the life of thought and desire, as"
101,PREFACE.,"well as outward word and deed, high and holy."
102,PREFACE.,
103,PREFACE.,It is not a brother's part to pass critical judgment upon a sister's
104,PREFACE.,"literary attainments, or mental and spiritual gifts, nor is it needful"
105,PREFACE.,in reference to Madame Ossoli. The world never has questioned her great
106,PREFACE.,learning or rich and varied culture; these have been uniformly
107,PREFACE.,"acknowledged. As a keen and sagacious critic of literature, as an"
108,PREFACE.,"admirer of whatever was noble, an abhorrer of all low and mean, this"
109,PREFACE.,"she was early, and is, so far as we know, without any question regarded."
110,PREFACE.,That her judgments have always been acquiesced in is far from true; but
111,PREFACE.,the public has ever believed them alike sincere and fearless. The life
112,PREFACE.,"without,--that of culture and intelligent, careful observation,--all"
113,PREFACE.,know _that_ stream to have been full to overflowing.
114,PREFACE.,
115,PREFACE.,"More and more, too, every year, the public are beginning to recognize"
116,PREFACE.,and appreciate the richness and the beauty of her inner life. The very
117,PREFACE.,"keenness of her critical acumen,--the very boldness of her rebuke of all"
118,PREFACE.,she deemed petty and base--the very truthfulness of her conformity to
119,PREFACE.,"her own standard--her very abhorrence of all cant and mere conformity,"
120,PREFACE.,"long prevented, and even yet somewhat hinder, many from adequately"
121,PREFACE.,"recognizing the loving spirit, the sympathetic nature, the Christian"
122,PREFACE.,"faith, and spiritual devoutness which made her domestic and social life,"
123,PREFACE.,"her action amid her own kindred and nation, and in Rome, for those not"
124,PREFACE.,"allied to her by birth and lineage, at once kindly, noble, and full of"
125,PREFACE.,holy self-sacrifice. Yet continually the world is learning these things:
126,PREFACE.,"the history of her life, as her memoirs reveal it, the testimony of so"
127,PREFACE.,"many witnesses here and in other lands, a more careful study and a wider"
128,PREFACE.,"reading of her works, are leading, perhaps rapidly enough, to a true"
129,PREFACE.,"appreciation of the spiritual beauty of her soul, and men see that the"
130,PREFACE.,"waters of her inner life form a stream at once clear and pure, deep and"
131,PREFACE.,broad.
132,PREFACE.,
133,PREFACE.,"In presenting to the public the last volume of Margaret Fuller's works,"
134,PREFACE.,"the Editor is encouraged to hope for them a candid, cordial reception."
135,PREFACE.,"It has been a work of love on his part, for which he has ever felt"
136,PREFACE.,"inadequate, and from it for a time shrunk. But each volume has had a"
137,PREFACE.,"wider and more cordial welcome than its predecessor, and works received"
138,PREFACE.,"by the great public almost with coldness when first published, have,"
139,PREFACE.,"when republished, had a large and cheering circulation, and, what is far"
140,PREFACE.,"better, a kindly appreciation not only by the few, but even by the many."
141,PREFACE.,This is evidence enough that the progress of time has brought the public
142,PREFACE.,"and my sister into closer sympathy and agreement, and a better"
143,PREFACE.,understanding on its part of her true views and character.
144,PREFACE.,
145,PREFACE.,The present volume is less than any of its predecessors a republication.
146,PREFACE.,_Only one of its articles has ever appeared before in book form._ As a
147,PREFACE.,"book, it is, then, essentially new, though some of its reviews and"
148,PREFACE.,essays have appeared in the columns of the Tribune and Dial. A large
149,PREFACE.,"portion of it has never appeared at all in print, especially its"
150,PREFACE.,"poetical portions. The work of collecting these essays, reviews, and"
151,PREFACE.,"poems has been a difficult one, much more than attended the preparation"
152,PREFACE.,"of the previous volumes. Unable, of course, to consult their author as"
153,PREFACE.,"to any of them, the revision I have given is doubtless very imperfect,"
154,PREFACE.,and requires large allowance. It is even possible that among the poems
155,PREFACE.,"one or more written by friends and sent her, or copied from some other"
156,PREFACE.,"author, may have crept in unawares; but this all possible pains have"
157,PREFACE.,"been taken to prevent. Such as it is, the volume is now before the"
158,PREFACE.,"public; it truly reveals her inner and outer life, and is doubtless the"
159,PREFACE.,last of the volumes containing the writings of MARGARET FULLER OSSOLI.

377,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"Menzel's view of Goethe is that of a Philistine, in the least"
378,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,opprobrious sense of the term. It is one which has long been applied in
379,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,Germany to petty cavillers and incompetent critics. I do not wish to
380,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,convey a sense so disrespectful in speaking of Menzel. He has a vigorous
381,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"and brilliant mind, and a wide, though imperfect, culture. He is a man"
382,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"of talent, but talent cannot comprehend genius. He judges of Goethe as"
383,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"a Philistine, inasmuch as he does not enter into Canaan, and read the"
384,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"prophet by the light of his own law, but looks at him from without, and"
385,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,tries him by a rule beneath which he never lived. That there _was_
386,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"something Menzel saw; what that something was _not_ he saw, but _what_"
387,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,it _was_ he could not see; none could _see_; it was something to be felt
388,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"and known at the time of its apparition, but the clear sight of it was"
389,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,reserved to a day far enough removed from its sphere to get a commanding
390,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,point of view. Has that day come? A little while ago it seemed so;
391,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"certain features of Goethe's personality, certain results of his"
392,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"tendency, had become so manifest. But as the plants he planted mature,"
393,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"they shed a new seed for a yet more noble growth. A wider experience, a"
394,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"deeper insight, make rejected words come true, and bring a more refined"
395,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,perception of meaning already discerned. Like all his elder brothers of
396,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"the elect band, the forlorn hope of humanity, he obliges us to live and"
397,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"grow, that we may walk by his side; vainly we strive to leave him behind"
398,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,in some niche of the hall of our ancestors; a few steps onward and we
399,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"find him again, of yet serener eye and more towering mien than on his"
400,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"other pedestal. Former measurements of his size have, like the girdle"
401,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"bound by the nymphs round the infant Apollo, only served to make him"
402,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"outgrow the unworthy compass. The still rising sun, with its broader"
403,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"light, shows us it is not yet noon. In him is soon perceived a prophet"
404,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"of our own age, as well as a representative of his own; and we doubt"
405,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,whether the revolutions of the century be not required to interpret the
406,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,quiet depths of his _Saga_.
407,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,
408,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"Sure it is that none has yet found Goethe's place, as sure that none"
409,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"can claim to be his peer, who has not some time, ay, and for a long"
410,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"time, been his pupil!"
411,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,
412,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"Yet much truth has been spoken of him in detail, some by Menzel, but in"
413,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"so superficial a spirit, and with so narrow a view of its bearings, as"
414,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,to have all the effect of falsehood. Such denials of the crown can only
415,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"fix it more firmly on the head of the ""Old Heathen."" To such the best"
416,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"answer may be given in the words of Bettina Brentan: ""The others"
417,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,criticise thy works; I only know that they lead us on and on till we
418,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"live in them."" And thus will all criticism end in making more men and"
419,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"women read these works, and ""on and on,"" till they forget whether the"
420,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"author be a patriot or a moralist, in the deep humanity of the thought,"
421,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,the breathing nature of the scene. While words they have accepted with
422,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"immediate approval fade from memory, these oft-denied words of keen,"
423,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,cold truth return with ever new force and significance.
424,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,
425,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"Men should be true, wise, beautiful, pure, and aspiring. This man was"
426,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"true and wise, capable of all things. Because he did not in one short"
427,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"life complete his circle, can we afford to lose him out of sight? Can"
428,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"we, in a world where so few men have in any degree redeemed their"
429,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"inheritance, neglect a nature so rich and so manifestly progressive?"
430,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,
431,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"Historically considered, Goethe needs no apology. His so-called faults"
432,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,fitted him all the better for the part he had to play. In cool
433,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"possession of his wide-ranging genius, he taught the imagination of"
434,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"Germany, that the highest flight should be associated with the steady"
435,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"sweep and undazzled eye of the eagle. Was he too much the connoisseur,"
436,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"did he attach too great an importance to the cultivation of taste, where"
437,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"just then German literature so much needed to be refined, polished, and"
438,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"harmonized? Was he too sceptical, too much an experimentalist,--how else"
439,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"could he have formed himself to be the keenest, and, at the same time,"
440,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"most nearly universal of observers, teaching theologians, philosophers,"
441,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"and patriots that nature comprehends them all, commands them all, and"
442,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"that no one development of life must exclude the rest? Do you talk, in"
443,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"the easy cant of the day, of German obscurity, extravagance, pedantry,"
444,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"and bad taste,--and will you blame this man, whose Greek, English,"
445,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"Italian, German mind steered so clear of these rocks and shoals,"
446,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"clearing, adjusting, and calming on each side, wherever he turned his"
447,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"prow? Was he not just enough of an idealist, just enough of a realist,"
448,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"for his peculiar task? If you want a moral enthusiast, is not there"
449,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"Schiller? If piety, of purest, mystic sweetness, who but Novalis?"
450,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"Exuberant sentiment, that treasures each withered leaf in a tender"
451,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"breast, look to your Richter. Would you have men to find plausible"
452,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"meaning for the deepest enigma, or to hang up each map of literature,"
453,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"well painted and dotted on its proper roller,--there are the Schlegels."
454,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"Men of ideas were numerous as migratory crows in autumn, and Jacobi"
455,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"wrote the heart into philosophy, as well as he could. Who could fill"
456,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"Goethe's place to Germany, and to the world, of which she is now the"
457,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,teacher? His much-reviled aristocratic turn was at that time a
458,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"reconciling element. It is plain why he was what he was, for his country"
459,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,and his age.
460,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,
461,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"Whoever looks into the history of his youth, will be struck by a"
462,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,peculiar force with which all things worked together to prepare him for
463,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,his office of artist-critic to the then chaotic world of thought in his
464,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,country. What an unusually varied scene of childhood and of youth! What
465,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,endless change and contrast of circumstances and influences! Father and
466,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"mother, life and literature, world and nature,--playing into one"
467,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"another's hands, always by antagonism! Never was a child so carefully"
468,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"guarded by fate against prejudice, against undue bias, against any"
469,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,engrossing sentiment. Nature having given him power of poetical sympathy
470,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"to know every situation, would not permit him to make himself at home in"
471,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,any. And how early what was most peculiar in his character manifested
472,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"itself, may be seen in these anecdotes related by his mother to Bettina."
473,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,
474,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"Of Goethe's childhood.--""He was not willing to play with other little"
475,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"children, unless they were very fair. In a circle he began suddenly to"
476,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"weep, screaming, 'Take away the black, ugly child; I cannot bear to have"
477,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"it here.' He could not be pacified; they were obliged to take him home,"
478,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,and there the mother could hardly console him for the child's ugliness.
479,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"He was then only three years old."""

481,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"""His mother was surprised, that when his brother Jacob died, who had"

484,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"whether he had not loved his brother, he ran into his room and brought"
485,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"from under his bed a bundle of papers, all written over, and said he had"
486,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"done all this for Jacob."""
487,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,
488,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"Even so in later years, had he been asked if he had not loved his"
489,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"country and his fellow-men, he would not have answered by tears and"
490,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"vows, but pointed to his works."
491,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,
492,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,In the first anecdote is observable that love of symmetry in external
493,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"relations which, in manhood, made him give up the woman he loved,"
494,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,because she would not have been in place among the old-fashioned
495,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"furniture of his father's house; and dictated the course which, at the"
496,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"crisis of his life, led him to choose an outward peace rather than an"
497,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"inward joy. In the second, he displays, at the earliest age, a sense of"
498,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"his vocation as a recorder, the same which drew him afterwards to write"
499,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"his life into verse, rather than clothe it in action. His indirectness,"
500,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"his aversion to the frankness of heroic meetings, is repulsive and"
501,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,suspicious to generous and flowing natures; yet many of the more
502,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"delicate products of the mind seem to need these sheaths, lest bird and"
503,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,insect rifle them in the bud.
504,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,
505,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"And if this subtlety, isolation, and distance be the dictate of nature,"
506,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"we submit, even as we are not vexed that the wild bee should hide its"
507,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"honey in some old moss-grown tree, rather than in the glass hives of our"
508,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"gardens. We believe it will repay the pains we take in seeking for it,"
509,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,by some peculiar flavor from unknown flowers. Was Goethe the wild bee?
510,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"We see that even in his boyhood he showed himself a very Egyptian, in"
511,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,his love for disguises; forever expressing his thought in roundabout
512,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"ways, which seem idle mummery to a mind of Spartan or Roman mould. Had"
513,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"he some simple thing to tell his friend, he read it from the newspaper,"
514,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"or wrote it into a parable. Did he make a visit, he put on the hat or"
515,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"wig of some other man, and made his bow as Schmidt or Schlosser, that"
516,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"they might stare, when he spoke as Goethe. He gives as the highest"
517,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"instance of passionate grief, that he gave up for one day watching the"
518,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,tedious ceremonies of the imperial coronation. In daily life many of
519,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"these carefully recorded passages have an air of platitude, at which no"
520,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"wonder the Edinburgh Review laughed. Yet, on examination, they are full"
521,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,of meaning. And when we see the same propensity writing itself into
522,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"Ganymede, Mahomet's song, the Bayadere, and Faust, telling all"
523,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"Goethe's religion in Mignon and Makana, all his wisdom in the"
524,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"Western-Eastern Divan, we respect it, accept, all but love it."

526,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"This theme is for a volume, and I must quit it now. A brief summary of"
527,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"what Goethe was suffices to vindicate his existence, as an agent in"
528,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"history and a part of nature, but will not meet the objections of those"
529,MENZEL'S VIEW OF GOETHE.,"who measure him, as they have a right to do, by the standard of ideal"

694,GOETHE.,
695,GOETHE.,The first of these mottoes is that prefixed by Goethe to the last
696,GOETHE.,"books of ""Dichtung und Wahrheit."" These books record the hour of turning"
697,GOETHE.,"tide in his life, the time when he was called on for a choice at the"
698,GOETHE.,"""Parting of the Ways."" From these months, which gave the sun of his"
699,GOETHE.,"youth, the crisis of his manhood, date the birth of Egmont, and of Faust"
700,GOETHE.,"too, though the latter was not published so early. They saw the rise and"
701,GOETHE.,"decline of his love for Lili, apparently the truest love he ever knew."
702,GOETHE.,That he was not himself dissatisfied with the results to which the
703,GOETHE.,"decisions of this era led him, we may infer from his choice of a motto,"
704,GOETHE.,and from the calm beauty with which he has invested the record.
705,GOETHE.,
706,GOETHE.,"The Parting of the Ways! The way he took led to court-favor, wealth,"
707,GOETHE.,"celebrity, and an independence of celebrity. It led to large"
708,GOETHE.,"performance, and a wonderful economical management of intellect. It led"
709,GOETHE.,"Faust, the Seeker, from the heights of his own mind to the trodden ways"
710,GOETHE.,"of the world. There, indeed, he did not lose sight of the mountains, but"
711,GOETHE.,he never breathed their keen air again.
712,GOETHE.,
713,GOETHE.,"After this period we find in him rather a wide and deep Wisdom, than the"
714,GOETHE.,"inspiration of Genius. His faith, that all _must_ issue well, wants the"
715,GOETHE.,"sweetness of piety, and the God he manifests to us is one of law or"
716,GOETHE.,"necessity, rather than of intelligent love. As this God makes because he"
717,GOETHE.,"must, so Goethe, his instrument, observes and re-creates because he"
718,GOETHE.,"must, observing with minutest fidelity the outward exposition of Nature;"
719,GOETHE.,"never blinded by a sham, or detained by a fear, he yet makes us feel"
720,GOETHE.,that he wants insight to her sacred secret. The calmest of writers does
721,GOETHE.,"not give us repose, because it is too difficult to find his centre."
722,GOETHE.,"Those flame-like natures, which he undervalues, give us more peace and"
723,GOETHE.,"hope, through their restless aspirations, than he with his"
724,GOETHE.,"hearth-enclosed fires of steady fulfilment. For, true as it is, that God"
725,GOETHE.,"is every where, we must not only see him, but see him acknowledged."
726,GOETHE.,"Through the consciousness of man, ""shall not Nature interpret God?"" We"
727,GOETHE.,"wander in diversity, and with each new turning of the path, long anew to"
728,GOETHE.,be referred to the One.
729,GOETHE.,
730,GOETHE.,"Of Goethe, as of other natures, where the intellect is too much"
731,GOETHE.,"developed in proportion to the moral nature, it is difficult to speak"
732,GOETHE.,"without seeming narrow, blind, and impertinent. For such men _see_ all"
733,GOETHE.,"that others _live_, and, if you feel a want of a faculty in them, it is"
734,GOETHE.,"hard to say they have it not, lest, next moment, they puzzle you by"
735,GOETHE.,"giving some indication of it. Yet they are not, nay, _know_ not; they"
736,GOETHE.,"only discern. The difference is that between sight and life, prescience"
737,GOETHE.,"and being, wisdom and love. Thus with Goethe. Naturally of a deep mind"
738,GOETHE.,"and shallow heart, he felt the sway of the affections enough to"
739,GOETHE.,"appreciate their workings in other men, but never enough to receive"
740,GOETHE.,their inmost regenerating influence.
741,GOETHE.,
742,GOETHE.,How this might have been had he ever once abandoned himself entirely to
743,GOETHE.,"a sentiment, it is impossible to say. But the education of his youth"
744,GOETHE.,"seconded, rather than balanced, his natural tendency. His father was a"
745,GOETHE.,"gentlemanly martinet; dull, sour, well-informed, and of great ambition"
746,GOETHE.,as to externals. His influence on the son was wholly artificial. He was
747,GOETHE.,always turning his powerful mind from side to side in search of
748,GOETHE.,"information, for the attainment of what are called accomplishments. The"
749,GOETHE.,"mother was a delightful person in her way; open, genial, playful, full"
750,GOETHE.,"of lively talent, but without earnestness of soul. She was one of those"
751,GOETHE.,"charming, but not noble persons, who take the day and the man as they"
752,GOETHE.,"find them, seeing the best that is there already, but never making the"
753,GOETHE.,"better grow in its stead. His sister, though of graver kind, was social"
754,GOETHE.,"and intellectual, not religious or tender. The mortifying repulse of his"
755,GOETHE.,early love checked the few pale buds of faith and tenderness that his
756,GOETHE.,heart put forth. His friends were friends of the intellect merely;
757,GOETHE.,"altogether, he seemed led by destiny to the place he was to fill."
758,GOETHE.,
759,GOETHE.,"Pardon him, World, that he was too worldly. Do not wonder, Heart, that"
760,GOETHE.,"he was so heartless. Believe, Soul, that one so true, as far as he went,"
761,GOETHE.,must yet be initiated into the deeper mysteries of Soul. Perhaps even
762,GOETHE.,now he sees that we must accept limitations only to transcend them; work
763,GOETHE.,in processes only to detect the organizing power which supersedes them;
764,GOETHE.,and that Sphinxes of fifty-five volumes might well be cast into the
765,GOETHE.,abyss before the single word that solves them all.
766,GOETHE.,
767,GOETHE.,"Now, when I think of Goethe, I seem to see his soul, all the"
768,GOETHE.,"variegated plumes of knowledge, artistic form ""und so weiter,"" burnt"
769,GOETHE.,"from it by the fires of divine love, wingless, motionless, unable to"
770,GOETHE.,"hide from itself in any subterfuge of labor, saying again and again, the"
771,GOETHE.,simple words which he would never distinctly say on earth--God beyond
772,GOETHE.,Nature--Faith beyond Sight--the Seeker nobler than the _Meister_.
773,GOETHE.,
774,GOETHE.,For this mastery that Goethe prizes seems to consist rather in the
775,GOETHE.,skilful use of means than in the clear manifestation of ends. His
776,GOETHE.,"Master, indeed, makes acknowledgment of a divine order, but the temporal"
777,GOETHE.,"uses are always uppermost in the mind of the reader. But of this, more"
778,GOETHE.,at large in reference to his works.
779,GOETHE.,
780,GOETHE.,"Apart from this want felt in his works, there is a littleness in his"
781,GOETHE.,aspect as a character. Why waste his time in Weimar court
782,GOETHE.,"entertainments? His duties as minister were not unworthy of him, though"
783,GOETHE.,"it would have been, perhaps, finer, if he had not spent so large a"
784,GOETHE.,"portion of that prime of intellectual life, from five and twenty to"
785,GOETHE.,"forty, upon them."
786,GOETHE.,
787,GOETHE.,"But granted that the exercise these gave his faculties, the various lore"
788,GOETHE.,"they brought, and the good they did to the community, made them worth"
789,GOETHE.,"his doing,--why that perpetual dangling after the royal family? Why all"
790,GOETHE.,"that verse-making for the albums of serene highnesses, and those pretty"
791,GOETHE.,"poetical entertainments for the young princesses, and that cold setting"
792,GOETHE.,"himself apart from his true peers, the real sovereigns of"
793,GOETHE.,"Weimar--Herder, Wieland, and the others? The excuse must be found in"
794,GOETHE.,"circumstances of his time and temperament, which made the character of"
795,GOETHE.,man of the world and man of affairs more attractive to him than the
796,GOETHE.,children of nature can conceive it to be in the eyes of one who is
797,GOETHE.,capable of being a consecrated bard.
798,GOETHE.,
799,GOETHE.,The man of genius feels that literature has become too much a craft by
800,GOETHE.,itself. No man should live by or for his pen. Writing is worthless
801,GOETHE.,except as the record of life; and no great man ever was satisfied thus
802,GOETHE.,to express all his being. His book should be only an indication of
803,GOETHE.,himself. The obelisk should point to a scene of conquest. In the present
804,GOETHE.,"state of division of labor, the literary man finds himself condemned to"
805,GOETHE.,be nothing else. Does he write a good book? it is not received as
806,GOETHE.,"evidence of his ability to live and act, but rather the reverse. Men do"
807,GOETHE.,"not offer him the care of embassies, as an earlier age did to Petrarca;"
808,GOETHE.,they would be surprised if he left his study to go forth to battle like
809,GOETHE.,"Cervantes. We have the swordsman, and statesman, and penman, but it is"
810,GOETHE.,"not considered that the same mind which can rule the destiny of a poem,"
811,GOETHE.,may as well that of an army or an empire.[2] Yet surely it should be so.
812,GOETHE.,"The scientific man may need seclusion from the common affairs of life,"
813,GOETHE.,for he has his materials before him; but the man of letters must seek
814,GOETHE.,"them in life, and he who cannot act will but imperfectly appreciate"
815,GOETHE.,action.
816,GOETHE.,
817,GOETHE.,The literary man is impatient at being set apart. He feels that monks
818,GOETHE.,"and troubadours, though in a similar position, were brought into more"
819,GOETHE.,"healthy connection with man and nature, than he who is supposed to look"
820,GOETHE.,at them merely to write them down. So he rebels; and Sir Walter Scott is
821,GOETHE.,"prouder of being a good sheriff and farmer, than of his reputation as"
822,GOETHE.,the Great Unknown. Byron piques himself on his skill in shooting and
823,GOETHE.,"swimming. Sir H. Davy and Schlegel would be admired as dandies, and"
824,GOETHE.,"Goethe, who had received an order from a publisher ""for a dozen more"
825,GOETHE.,"dramas in the same style as Goetz von Berlichingen,"" and though (in"
826,GOETHE.,"sadder sooth) he had already Faust in his head asking to be written out,"
827,GOETHE.,thought it no degradation to become premier in the little Duchy of
828,GOETHE.,Weimar.
829,GOETHE.,
830,GOETHE.,"""Straws show which way the wind blows,"" and a comment may be drawn from"
831,GOETHE.,"the popular novels, where the literary man is obliged to wash off the"
832,GOETHE.,"ink in a violet bath, attest his courage in the duel, and hide his"
833,GOETHE.,idealism beneath the vulgar nonchalance and coxcombry of the man of
834,GOETHE.,fashion.
835,GOETHE.,
836,GOETHE.,If this tendency of his time had some influence in making Goethe find
837,GOETHE.,"pleasure in tangible power and decided relations with society, there"
838,GOETHE.,were other causes which worked deeper. The growth of genius in its
839,GOETHE.,relations to men around must always be attended with daily pain. The
840,GOETHE.,enchanted eye turns from the far-off star it has detected to the
841,GOETHE.,"short-sighted bystander, and the seer is mocked for pretending to see"
842,GOETHE.,what others cannot. The large and generalizing mind infers the whole
843,GOETHE.,"from a single circumstance, and is reproved by all around for its"
844,GOETHE.,"presumptuous judgment. Its Ithuriel temper pierces shams, creeds,"
845,GOETHE.,"covenants, and chases the phantoms which others embrace, till the lovers"
846,GOETHE.,of the false Florimels hurl the true knight to the ground. Little men
847,GOETHE.,"are indignant that Hercules, yet an infant, declares he has strangled"
848,GOETHE.,the serpent; they demand a proof; they send him out into scenes of labor
849,GOETHE.,to bring thence the voucher that his father is a god. What the ancients
850,GOETHE.,"meant to express by Apollo's continual disappointment in his loves, is"
851,GOETHE.,felt daily in the youth of genius. The sympathy he seeks flies his
852,GOETHE.,"touch, the objects of his affection sneer at his sublime credulity, his"
853,GOETHE.,"self-reliance is arrogance, his far sight infatuation, and his ready"
854,GOETHE.,detection of fallacy fickleness and inconsistency. Such is the youth of
855,GOETHE.,"genius, before the soul has given that sign of itself which an"
856,GOETHE.,unbelieving generation cannot controvert. Even then he is little
857,GOETHE.,benefited by the transformation of the mockers into worshippers. For the
858,GOETHE.,"soul seeks not adorers, but peers; not blind worship, but intelligent"
859,GOETHE.,sympathy. The best consolation even then is that which Goethe puts
860,GOETHE.,"into the mouth of Tasso: ""To me gave a God to tell what I suffer."" In"
861,GOETHE.,"""Tasso"" Goethe has described the position of the poetical mind in its"
862,GOETHE.,prose relations with equal depth and fulness. We see what he felt must
863,GOETHE.,be the result of entire abandonment to the highest nature. We see why he
864,GOETHE.,"valued himself on being able to understand the Alphonsos, and meet as an"
865,GOETHE.,equal the Antonios of every-day life.
866,GOETHE.,
867,GOETHE.,"But, you say, there is no likeness between Goethe and Tasso. Never"
868,GOETHE.,believe it; such pictures are not painted from observation merely. That
869,GOETHE.,deep coloring which fills them with light and life is given by dipping
870,GOETHE.,the brush in one's own life-blood. Goethe had not from nature that
871,GOETHE.,character of self-reliance and self-control in which he so long appeared
872,GOETHE.,"to the world. It was wholly acquired, and so highly valued because he"
873,GOETHE.,"was conscious of the opposite tendency. He was by nature as impetuous,"
874,GOETHE.,"though not as tender, as Tasso, and the disadvantage at which this"
875,GOETHE.,constantly placed him was keenly felt by a mind made to appreciate the
876,GOETHE.,subtlest harmonies in all relations. Therefore was it that when he at
877,GOETHE.,"last cast anchor, he was so reluctant again to trust himself to wave and"
878,GOETHE.,breeze.
879,GOETHE.,
880,GOETHE.,I have before spoken of the antagonistic influences under which he was
881,GOETHE.,"educated. He was driven from the severity of study into the world, and"
882,GOETHE.,"then again drawn back, many times in the course of his crowded youth."
883,GOETHE.,"Both the world and the study he used with unceasing ardor, but not with"
884,GOETHE.,the sweetness of a peaceful hope. Most of the traits which are
885,GOETHE.,considered to mark his character at a later period were wanting to him
886,GOETHE.,"in youth. He was very social, and continually perturbed by his social"
887,GOETHE.,sympathies. He was deficient both in outward self-possession and mental
888,GOETHE.,"self-trust. ""I was always,"" he says, ""either _too volatile or too"
889,GOETHE.,"infatuated_, so that those who looked kindly on me did by no means"
890,GOETHE.,"always honor me with their esteem."" He wrote much and with great"
891,GOETHE.,"freedom. The pen came naturally to his hand, but he had no confidence in"
892,GOETHE.,"the merit of what he wrote, and much inferior persons to Merck and"
893,GOETHE.,Herder might have induced him to throw aside as worthless what it had
894,GOETHE.,given him sincere pleasure to compose. It was hard for him to isolate
895,GOETHE.,"himself, to console himself, and, though his mind was always busy with"
896,GOETHE.,"important thoughts, they did not free him from the pressure of other"
897,GOETHE.,minds. His youth was as sympathetic and impetuous as any on record.
898,GOETHE.,
899,GOETHE.,The effect of all this outward pressure on the poet is recorded in
900,GOETHE.,"Werther--a production that he afterwards under-valued, and to which he"
901,GOETHE.,even felt positive aversion. It was natural that this should be. In the
902,GOETHE.,"calm air of the cultivated plain he attained, the remembrance of the"
903,GOETHE.,miasma of sentimentality was odious to him. Yet sentimentality is but
904,GOETHE.,"sentiment diseased, which to be cured must be patiently observed by the"
905,GOETHE.,"wise physician; so are the morbid desire and despair of Werther, the"
906,GOETHE.,"sickness of a soul aspiring to a purer, freer state, but mistaking the"
907,GOETHE.,way.
908,GOETHE.,
909,GOETHE.,The best or the worst occasion in man's life is precisely that misused
910,GOETHE.,"in Werther, when he longs for more love, more freedom, and a larger"
911,GOETHE.,development of genius than the limitations of this terrene sphere
912,GOETHE.,"permit. Sad is it indeed if, persisting to grasp too much at once, he"
913,GOETHE.,"lose all, as Werther did. He must accept limitation, must consent to do"
914,GOETHE.,"his work in time, must let his affections be baffled by the barriers of"
915,GOETHE.,"convention. Tantalus-like, he makes this world a Tartarus, or, like"
916,GOETHE.,"Hercules, rises in fires to heaven, according as he knows how to"
917,GOETHE.,"interpret his lot. But he must only use, not adopt it. The boundaries of"
918,GOETHE.,the man must never be confounded with the destiny of the soul. If he
919,GOETHE.,"does not decline his destiny, as Werther did, it is his honor to have"
920,GOETHE.,felt its unfitness for his eternal scope. He was born for wings; he is
921,GOETHE.,held to walk in leading-strings; nothing lower than faith must make him
922,GOETHE.,"resigned, and only in hope should he find content--a hope not of some"
923,GOETHE.,"slight improvement in his own condition or that of other men, but a hope"
924,GOETHE.,"justified by the divine justice, which is bound in due time to satisfy"
925,GOETHE.,every want of his nature.
926,GOETHE.,
927,GOETHE.,"Schiller's great command is, ""Keep true to the dream of thy youth."" The"
928,GOETHE.,"great problem is how to make the dream real, through the exercise of the"
929,GOETHE.,waking will.
930,GOETHE.,
931,GOETHE.,This was not exactly the problem Goethe tried to solve. To _do_
932,GOETHE.,"somewhat, became too important, as is indicated both by the second motto"
933,GOETHE.,"to this essay, and by his maxim, ""It is not the knowledge of what _might"
934,GOETHE.,"be_, but what _is_, that forms us."""
935,GOETHE.,
936,GOETHE.,"Werther, like his early essays now republished from the Frankfort"
937,GOETHE.,"Journal, is characterized by a fervid eloquence of Italian glow, which"
938,GOETHE.,betrays a part of his character almost lost sight of in the quiet
939,GOETHE.,"transparency of his later productions, and may give us some idea of the"
940,GOETHE.,mental conflicts through which he passed to manhood.
941,GOETHE.,
942,GOETHE.,"The acting out the mystery into life, the calmness of survey, and the"
943,GOETHE.,"passionateness of feeling, above all the ironical baffling at the end,"
944,GOETHE.,and want of point to a tale got up with such an eye to effect as he goes
945,GOETHE.,"along, mark well the man that was to be. Even so did he demand in"
946,GOETHE.,Werther; even so resolutely open the door in the first part of Faust;
947,GOETHE.,even so seem to play with himself and his contemporaries in the second
948,GOETHE.,part of Faust and Wilhelm Meister.
949,GOETHE.,
950,GOETHE.,"Yet was he deeply earnest in his play, not for men, but for himself. To"
951,GOETHE.,"himself as a part of nature it was important to grow, to lift his head"
952,GOETHE.,"to the light. In nature he had all confidence; for man, as a part of"
953,GOETHE.,"nature, infinite hope; but in him as an individual will, seemingly, not"
954,GOETHE.,much trust at the earliest age.
955,GOETHE.,
956,GOETHE.,The history of his intimacies marks his course; they were entered into
957,GOETHE.,"with passionate eagerness, but always ended in an observation of the"
958,GOETHE.,"intellect, and he left them on his road, as the snake leaves his skin."
959,GOETHE.,The first man he met of sufficient force to command a large share of his
960,GOETHE.,"attention was Herder, and the benefit of this intercourse was critical,"
961,GOETHE.,"not genial. Of the good Lavater he soon perceived the weakness. Merck,"
962,GOETHE.,"again, commanded his respect; but the force of Merck also was cold."
963,GOETHE.,
964,GOETHE.,But in the Grand Duke of Weimar he seems to have met a character strong
965,GOETHE.,enough to exercise a decisive influence upon his own. Goethe was not
966,GOETHE.,so politic and worldly that a little man could ever have become his
967,GOETHE.,Mæcenas. In the Duchess Amelia and her son he found that practical
968,GOETHE.,"sagacity, large knowledge of things as they are, active force, and"
969,GOETHE.,"genial feeling, which he had never before seen combined."
970,GOETHE.,
971,GOETHE.,The wise mind of the duchess gave the first impulse to the noble course
972,GOETHE.,of Weimar. But that her son should have availed himself of the
973,GOETHE.,"foundation she laid is praise enough, in a world where there is such a"
974,GOETHE.,rebound from parental influence that it generally seems that the child
975,GOETHE.,makes use of the directions given by the parent only to avoid the
976,GOETHE.,"prescribed path. The duke availed himself of guidance, though with a"
977,GOETHE.,perfect independence in action. The duchess had the unusual wisdom to
978,GOETHE.,"know the right time for giving up the reins, and thus maintained her"
979,GOETHE.,authority as far as the weight of her character was calculated to give
980,GOETHE.,it.
981,GOETHE.,
982,GOETHE.,"Of her Goethe was thinking when he wrote, ""The admirable woman is she,"
983,GOETHE.,"who, if the husband dies, can be a father to the children."""
984,GOETHE.,
985,GOETHE.,The duke seems to have been one of those characters which are best known
986,GOETHE.,"by the impression their personal presence makes on us, resembling an"
987,GOETHE.,"elemental and pervasive force, rather than wearing the features of an"
988,GOETHE.,"individuality. Goethe describes him as ""_Dämonische_,"" that is, gifted"
989,GOETHE.,"with an instinctive, spontaneous force, which at once, without"
990,GOETHE.,"calculation or foresight, chooses the right means to an end. As these"
991,GOETHE.,"beings do not calculate, so is their influence incalculable. Their"
992,GOETHE.,"repose has as much influence over other beings as their action, even as"
993,GOETHE.,"the thunder cloud, lying black and distant in the summer sky, is not"
994,GOETHE.,less imposing than when it bursts and gives forth its quick lightnings.
995,GOETHE.,"Such men were Mirabeau and Swift. They had also distinct talents, but"
996,GOETHE.,their influence was from a perception in the minds of men of this
997,GOETHE.,"spontaneous energy in their natures. Sometimes, though rarely, we see"
998,GOETHE.,such a man in an obscure position; circumstances have not led him to a
999,GOETHE.,large sphere; he may not have expressed in words a single thought worth
1000,GOETHE.,recording; but by his eye and voice he rules all around him.
1001,GOETHE.,
1002,GOETHE.,He stands upon his feet with a firmness and calm security which make
1003,GOETHE.,other men seem to halt and totter in their gait. In his deep eye is seen
1004,GOETHE.,"an infinite comprehension, an infinite reserve of power. No accent of"
1005,GOETHE.,"his sonorous voice is lost on any ear within hearing; and, when he"
1006,GOETHE.,"speaks, men hate or fear perhaps the disturbing power they feel, but"
1007,GOETHE.,never dream of disobeying. But hear Goethe himself.
1008,GOETHE.,
1009,GOETHE.,"""The boy believed in nature, in the animate and inanimate the"
1010,GOETHE.,"intelligent and unconscious, to discover somewhat which manifested"
1011,GOETHE.,"itself only through contradiction, and therefore could not be"
1012,GOETHE.,"comprehended by any conception, much less defined by a word. It was not"
1013,GOETHE.,"divine, for it seemed without reason; not human, because without"
1014,GOETHE.,"understanding; not devilish, because it worked to good; not angelic,"
1015,GOETHE.,because it often betrayed a petulant love of mischief. It was like
1016,GOETHE.,"chance, in that it proved no sequence; it suggested the thought of"
1017,GOETHE.,"Providence, because it indicated connection. To this all our limitations"
1018,GOETHE.,seem penetrable; it seemed to play at will with all the elements of our
1019,GOETHE.,being; it compressed time and dilated space. Only in the impossible did
1020,GOETHE.,"it seem to delight, and to cast the possible aside with disdain."
1021,GOETHE.,
1022,GOETHE.,"""This existence which seemed to mingle with others, sometimes to"
1023,GOETHE.,"separate, sometimes to unite, I called the Dämonische, after the example"
1024,GOETHE.,"of the ancients, and others who have observed somewhat similar.""--_Dichtung"
1025,GOETHE.,und Wahrheit._
1026,GOETHE.,
1027,GOETHE.,"""The Dämonische is that which cannot be explained by reason or"
1028,GOETHE.,"understanding; it lies not in my nature, but I am subject to it."
1029,GOETHE.,
1030,GOETHE.,"""Napoleon was a being of this class, and in so high a degree that scarce"
1031,GOETHE.,any one is to be compared with him. Also our late grand duke was such a
1032,GOETHE.,"nature, full of unlimited power of action and unrest, so that his own"
1033,GOETHE.,"dominion was too little for him, and the greatest would have been too"
1034,GOETHE.,little. Demoniac beings of this sort the Greeks reckoned among their
1035,GOETHE.,"demigods.""--_Conversations with Eckermann._[3]"
1036,GOETHE.,
1037,GOETHE.,"This great force of will, this instinctive directness of action, gave"
1038,GOETHE.,the duke an immediate ascendency over Goethe which no other person had
1039,GOETHE.,ever possessed. It was by no means mere sycophancy that made him give up
1040,GOETHE.,"the next ten years, the prime of his manhood, to accompanying the grand"
1041,GOETHE.,"duke in his revels, or aiding him in his schemes of practical utility,"
1042,GOETHE.,or to contriving elegant amusements for the ladies of the court. It was
1043,GOETHE.,a real admiration for the character of the genial man of the world and
1044,GOETHE.,its environment.
1045,GOETHE.,
1046,GOETHE.,"Whoever is turned from his natural path may, if he will, gain in"
1047,GOETHE.,largeness and depth what he loses in simple beauty; and so it was with
1048,GOETHE.,"Goethe. Faust became a wiser if not a nobler being. Werther, who must"
1049,GOETHE.,"die because life was not wide enough and rich enough in love for him,"
1050,GOETHE.,"ends as the Meister of the Wanderjahre, well content to be one never"
1051,GOETHE.,"inadequate to the occasion, ""help-full, comfort-full."""
1052,GOETHE.,
1053,GOETHE.,"A great change was, during these years, perceptible to his friends in"
1054,GOETHE.,"the character of Goethe. From being always ""either too volatile or"
1055,GOETHE.,"infatuated,"" he retreated into a self-collected state, which seemed at"
1056,GOETHE.,first even icy to those around him. No longer he darted about him the
1057,GOETHE.,"lightnings of his genius, but sat Jove-like and calm, with the"
1058,GOETHE.,"thunderbolts grasped in his hand, and the eagle gathered to his feet."
1059,GOETHE.,His freakish wit was subdued into a calm and even cold irony; his
1060,GOETHE.,multiplied relations no longer permitted him to abandon himself to any;
1061,GOETHE.,the minister and courtier could not expatiate in the free regions of
1062,GOETHE.,"invention, and bring upon paper the signs of his higher life, without"
1063,GOETHE.,subjecting himself to an artificial process of isolation. Obliged to
1064,GOETHE.,"economy of time and means, he made of his intimates not objects of"
1065,GOETHE.,"devout tenderness, of disinterested care, but the crammers and feeders"
1066,GOETHE.,"of his intellect. The world was to him an arena or a studio, but not a"
1067,GOETHE.,temple.
1068,GOETHE.,
1069,GOETHE.,"""Ye cannot serve God and Mammon."""
1070,GOETHE.,
1071,GOETHE.,"Had Goethe entered upon practical life from the dictate of his spirit,"
1072,GOETHE.,"which bade him not be a mere author, but a living, loving man, that had"
1073,GOETHE.,"all been well. But he must also be a man of the world, and nothing can"
1074,GOETHE.,"be more unfavorable to true manhood than this ambition. The citizen, the"
1075,GOETHE.,"hero, the general, the poet, all these are in true relations; but what"
1076,GOETHE.,"is called being a man of the world is to truckle to it, not truly to"
1077,GOETHE.,serve it.
1078,GOETHE.,
1079,GOETHE.,"Thus fettered in false relations, detained from retirement upon the"
1080,GOETHE.,"centre of his being, yet so relieved from the early pressure of his"
1081,GOETHE.,"great thoughts as to pity more pious souls for being restless seekers,"
1082,GOETHE.,"no wonder that he wrote,--"
1083,GOETHE.,
1084,GOETHE.,"""Es ist dafür gesorgt dass die Bäume nicht in den Himmel wachsen."""
1085,GOETHE.,
1086,GOETHE.,"""Care is taken that the trees grow not up into the heavens."" Ay, Goethe,"
1087,GOETHE.,but in proportion to their force of aspiration is their height.
1088,GOETHE.,
1089,GOETHE.,Yet never let him be confounded with those who sell all their
1090,GOETHE.,"birthright. He became blind to the more generous virtues, the nobler"
1091,GOETHE.,"impulses, but ever in self-respect was busy to develop his nature. He"
1092,GOETHE.,"was kind, industrious, wise, gentlemanly, if not manly. If his genius"
1093,GOETHE.,"lost sight of the highest aim, he is the best instructor in the use of"
1094,GOETHE.,"means; ceasing to be a prophet poet, he was still a poetic artist. From"
1095,GOETHE.,"this time forward he seems a listener to nature, but not himself the"
1096,GOETHE.,"highest product of nature,--a priest to the soul of nature. His works"
1097,GOETHE.,"grow out of life, but are not instinct with the peculiar life of human"
1098,GOETHE.,"resolve, as are Shakspeare's or Dante's."
1099,GOETHE.,
1100,GOETHE.,"Faust contains the great idea of his life, as indeed there is but one"
1101,GOETHE.,great poetic idea possible to man--the progress of a soul through the
1102,GOETHE.,various forms of existence.
1103,GOETHE.,
1104,GOETHE.,"All his other works, whatever their miraculous beauty of execution, are"
1105,GOETHE.,"mere chapters to this poem, illustrative of particular points. Faust,"
1106,GOETHE.,"had it been completed in the spirit in which it was begun, would have"
1107,GOETHE.,been the Divina Commedia of its age.
1108,GOETHE.,
1109,GOETHE.,But nothing can better show the difference of result between a stern and
1110,GOETHE.,"earnest life, and one of partial accommodation, than a comparison"
1111,GOETHE.,between the Paridiso and that of the second part of Faust. In both a
1112,GOETHE.,"soul, gradually educated and led back to God, is received at last not"
1113,GOETHE.,"through merit, but grace. But O the difference between the grandly"
1114,GOETHE.,"humble reliance of old Catholicism, and the loophole redemption of"
1115,GOETHE.,"modern sagacity! Dante was a _man_, of vehement passions, many"
1116,GOETHE.,"prejudices, bitter as much as sweet. His knowledge was scanty, his"
1117,GOETHE.,"sphere of observation narrow, the objects of his active life petty,"
1118,GOETHE.,"compared with those of Goethe. But, constantly retiring to his deepest"
1119,GOETHE.,"self, clearsighted to the limitations of man, but no less so to the"
1120,GOETHE.,"illimitable energy of the soul, the sharpest details in his work convey"
1121,GOETHE.,"a largest sense, as his strongest and steadiest flights only direct the"
1122,GOETHE.,eye to heavens yet beyond.
1123,GOETHE.,
1124,GOETHE.,"Yet perhaps he had not so hard a battle to wage, as this other great"
1125,GOETHE.,poet. The fiercest passions are not so dangerous foes to the soul as the
1126,GOETHE.,cold scepticism of the understanding. The Jewish demon assailed the man
1127,GOETHE.,"of Uz with physical ills, the Lucifer of the middle ages tempted his"
1128,GOETHE.,passions; but the Mephistopheles of the eighteenth century bade the
1129,GOETHE.,"finite strive to compass the infinite, and the intellect attempt to"
1130,GOETHE.,solve all the problems of the soul.
1131,GOETHE.,
1132,GOETHE.,This path Faust had taken: it is that of modern necromancy. Not willing
1133,GOETHE.,"to grow into God by the steady worship of a life, men would enforce his"
1134,GOETHE.,presence by a spell; not willing to learn his existence by the slow
1135,GOETHE.,"processes of their own, they strive to bind it in a word, that they may"
1136,GOETHE.,wear it about the neck as a talisman.
1137,GOETHE.,
1138,GOETHE.,"Faust, bent upon reaching the centre of the universe through the"
1139,GOETHE.,"intellect alone, naturally, after a length of trial, which has prevented"
1140,GOETHE.,"the harmonious unfolding of his nature, falls into despair. He has"
1141,GOETHE.,"striven for one object, and that object eludes him. Returning upon"
1142,GOETHE.,"himself, he finds large tracts of his nature lying waste and cheerless."
1143,GOETHE.,"He is too noble for apathy, too wise for vulgar content with the animal"
1144,GOETHE.,enjoyments of life. Yet the thirst he has been so many years increasing
1145,GOETHE.,"is not to be borne. Give me, he cries, but a drop of water to cool my"
1146,GOETHE.,"burning tongue. Yet, in casting himself with a wild recklessness upon"
1147,GOETHE.,"the impulses of his nature yet untried, there is a disbelief that any"
1148,GOETHE.,thing short of the All can satisfy the immortal spirit. His first
1149,GOETHE.,"attempt was noble, though mistaken, and under the saving influence of"
1150,GOETHE.,"it, he makes the compact, whose condition cheats the fiend at last."
1151,GOETHE.,
1152,GOETHE.,Kannst du mich schmeichelnd je belügen
1153,GOETHE.,"Dass ich mir selbst gefallen mag,"
1154,GOETHE.,Kannst du mich mit Genuss betrügen:
1155,GOETHE.,Das sey für mich der letzte Tag.
1156,GOETHE.,
1157,GOETHE.,Werd ich zum Augenblicke sagen:
1158,GOETHE.,Verweile doch! du bist so schön!
1159,GOETHE.,"Dann magst du mich in Fesseln schlagen,"
1160,GOETHE.,Dann will ich gern zu Grunde gehen.
1161,GOETHE.,
1162,GOETHE.,Canst thou by falsehood or by flattery
1163,GOETHE.,"Make me one moment with myself at peace,"
1164,GOETHE.,Cheat me into tranquillity? Come then
1165,GOETHE.,"And welcome, life's last day."
1166,GOETHE.,"Make me but to the moment say,"
1167,GOETHE.,"O fly not yet, thou art so fair,"
1168,GOETHE.,"Then let me perish, &c."
1169,GOETHE.,
1170,GOETHE.,But this condition is never fulfilled. Faust cannot be content with
1171,GOETHE.,"sensuality, with the charlatanry of ambition, nor with riches. His heart"
1172,GOETHE.,"never becomes callous, nor his moral and intellectual perceptions"
1173,GOETHE.,obtuse. He is saved at last.
1174,GOETHE.,
1175,GOETHE.,With the progress of an individual soul is shadowed forth that of the
1176,GOETHE.,soul of the age; beginning in intellectual scepticism; sinking into
1177,GOETHE.,"license; cheating itself with dreams of perfect bliss, to be at once"
1178,GOETHE.,attained by means no surer than a spurious paper currency; longing
1179,GOETHE.,"itself back from conflict between the spirit and the flesh, induced by"
1180,GOETHE.,"Christianity, to the Greek era with its harmonious development of body"
1181,GOETHE.,and mind; striving to reëmbody the loved phantom of classical beauty in
1182,GOETHE.,the heroism of the middle age; flying from the Byron despair of those
1183,GOETHE.,"who die because they cannot soar without wings, to schemes however"
1184,GOETHE.,"narrow, of practical utility,--redeemed at last through mercy alone."
1185,GOETHE.,
1186,GOETHE.,"The second part of Faust is full of meaning, resplendent with beauty;"
1187,GOETHE.,but it is rather an appendix to the first part than a fulfilment of its
1188,GOETHE.,"promise. The world, remembering the powerful stamp of individual"
1189,GOETHE.,"feeling, universal indeed in its application, but individual in its"
1190,GOETHE.,"life, which had conquered all its scruples in the first part, was vexed"
1191,GOETHE.,"to find, instead of the man Faust, the spirit of the age,--discontented"
1192,GOETHE.,"with the shadowy manifestation of truths it longed to embrace, and,"
1193,GOETHE.,"above all, disappointed that the author no longer met us face to face,"
1194,GOETHE.,or riveted the ear by his deep tones of grief and resolve.
1195,GOETHE.,
1196,GOETHE.,When the world shall have got rid of the still overpowering influence of
1197,GOETHE.,"the first part, it will be seen that the fundamental idea is never lost"
1198,GOETHE.,"sight of in the second. The change is that Goethe, though the same"
1199,GOETHE.,"thinker, is no longer the same person."
1200,GOETHE.,
1201,GOETHE.,The continuation of Faust in the practical sense of the education of a
1202,GOETHE.,man is to be found in Wilhelm Meister. Here we see the change by
1203,GOETHE.,strongest contrast. The mainspring of action is no longer the
1204,GOETHE.,"impassioned and noble seeker, but a disciple of circumstance, whose most"
1205,GOETHE.,marked characteristic is a taste for virtue and knowledge. Wilhelm
1206,GOETHE.,"certainly prefers these conditions of existence to their opposites, but"
1207,GOETHE.,there is nothing so decided in his character as to prevent his turning a
1208,GOETHE.,clear eye on every part of that variegated world-scene which the writer
1209,GOETHE.,wished to place before us.
1210,GOETHE.,
1211,GOETHE.,To see all till he knows all sufficiently to put objects into their
1212,GOETHE.,"relations, then to concentrate his powers and use his knowledge under"
1213,GOETHE.,"recognized conditions,--such is the progress of man from Apprentice to"
1214,GOETHE.,Master.
1215,GOETHE.,
1216,GOETHE.,'Tis pity that the volumes of the Wanderjahre have not been translated
1217,GOETHE.,"entire, as well as those of the Lehrjahre, for many, who have read the"
1218,GOETHE.,"latter only, fancy that Wilhelm becomes a master in that work. Far from"
1219,GOETHE.,it; he has but just become conscious of the higher powers that have
1220,GOETHE.,"ceaselessly been weaving his fate. Far from being as yet a Master, he"
1221,GOETHE.,but now begins to be a Knower. In the Wanderjahre we find him gradually
1222,GOETHE.,"learning the duties of citizenship, and hardening into manhood, by"
1223,GOETHE.,applying what he has learned for himself to the education of his child.
1224,GOETHE.,He converses on equal terms with the wise and beneficent; he is no
1225,GOETHE.,"longer duped and played with for his good, but met directly mind to"
1226,GOETHE.,mind.
1227,GOETHE.,
1228,GOETHE.,"Wilhelm is a master when he can command his actions, yet keep his mind"
1229,GOETHE.,always open to new means of knowledge; when he has looked at various
1230,GOETHE.,"ways of living, various forms of religion and of character, till he has"
1231,GOETHE.,"learned to be tolerant of all, discerning of good in all; when the"
1232,GOETHE.,"astronomer imparts to his equal ear his highest thoughts, and the poor"
1233,GOETHE.,cottager seeks his aid as a patron and counsellor.
1234,GOETHE.,
1235,GOETHE.,"To be capable of all duties, limited by none, with an open eye, a"
1236,GOETHE.,"skilful and ready hand, an assured step, a mind deep, calm, foreseeing"
1237,GOETHE.,"without anxiety, hopeful without the aid of illusion,--such is the ripe"
1238,GOETHE.,"state of manhood. This attained, the great soul should still seek and"
1239,GOETHE.,"labor, but strive and battle never more."
1240,GOETHE.,
1241,GOETHE.,"The reason for Goethe's choosing so negative a character as Wilhelm,"
1242,GOETHE.,"and leading him through scenes of vulgarity and low vice, would be"
1243,GOETHE.,"obvious enough to a person of any depth of thought, even if he himself"
1244,GOETHE.,had not announced it. He thus obtained room to paint life as it really
1245,GOETHE.,"is, and bring forward those slides in the magic lantern which are always"
1246,GOETHE.,"known to exist, though they may not be spoken of to ears polite."
1247,GOETHE.,
1248,GOETHE.,"Wilhelm cannot abide in tradition, nor do as his fathers did before him,"
1249,GOETHE.,"merely for the sake of money or a standing in society. The stage, here"
1250,GOETHE.,"an emblem of the ideal life as it gleams before unpractised eyes,"
1251,GOETHE.,"offers, he fancies, opportunity for a life of thought as distinguished"
1252,GOETHE.,"from one of routine. Here, no longer the simple citizen, but Man, all"
1253,GOETHE.,"Men, he will rightly take upon himself the different aspects of life,"
1254,GOETHE.,"till poet-wise, he shall have learned them all."
1255,GOETHE.,
1256,GOETHE.,No doubt the attraction of the stage to young persons of a vulgar
1257,GOETHE.,"character is merely the brilliancy of its trappings; but to Wilhelm, as"
1258,GOETHE.,"to Goethe, it was this poetic freedom and daily suggestion which"
1259,GOETHE.,seemed likely to offer such an agreeable studio in the greenroom.
1260,GOETHE.,
1261,GOETHE.,"But the ideal must be rooted in the real, else the poet's life"
1262,GOETHE.,degenerates into buffoonery or vice. Wilhelm finds the characters formed
1263,GOETHE.,by this would-be ideal existence more despicable than those which grew
1264,GOETHE.,"up on the track, dusty and bustling and dull as it had seemed, of common"
1265,GOETHE.,life. He is prepared by disappointment for a higher ambition.
1266,GOETHE.,
1267,GOETHE.,"In the house of the count he finds genuine elegance, genuine sentiment,"
1268,GOETHE.,"but not sustained by wisdom, or a devotion to important objects. This"
1269,GOETHE.,"love, this life, is also inadequate."
1270,GOETHE.,
1271,GOETHE.,"Now, with Teresa he sees the blessings of domestic peace. He sees a mind"
1272,GOETHE.,"sufficient for itself, finding employment and education in the perfect"
1273,GOETHE.,economy of a little world. The lesson is pertinent to the state of mind
1274,GOETHE.,"in which his former experiences have left him, as indeed our deepest"
1275,GOETHE.,lore is won from reaction. But a sudden change of scene introduces him
1276,GOETHE.,"to the society of the sage and learned uncle, the sage and beneficent"
1277,GOETHE.,"Natalia. Here he finds the same virtues as with Teresa, and enlightened"
1278,GOETHE.,by a larger wisdom.
1279,GOETHE.,
1280,GOETHE.,"A friend of mine says that his ideal of a friend is a worthy aunt, one"
1281,GOETHE.,"who has the tenderness without the blindness of a mother, and takes the"
1282,GOETHE.,same charge of the child's mind as the mother of its body. I don't know
1283,GOETHE.,"but this may have a foundation in truth, though, if so, auntism, like"
1284,GOETHE.,"other grand professions, has sadly degenerated. At any rate, Goethe"
1285,GOETHE.,"seems to be possessed with a similar feeling. The Count de Thorane, a"
1286,GOETHE.,"man of powerful character, who made a deep impression on his childhood,"
1287,GOETHE.,"was, he says, ""reverenced by me as an uncle."" And the ideal wise man of"
1288,GOETHE.,"this common life epic stands before us as ""The Uncle."""
1289,GOETHE.,
1290,GOETHE.,After seeing the working of just views in the establishment of the
1291,GOETHE.,"uncle, learning piety from the Confessions of a Beautiful Soul, and"
1292,GOETHE.,"religious beneficence from the beautiful life of Natalia, Wilhelm is"
1293,GOETHE.,"deemed worthy of admission to the society of the Illuminati, that is,"
1294,GOETHE.,"those who have pierced the secret of life, and know what it is to be and"
1295,GOETHE.,to do.
1296,GOETHE.,
1297,GOETHE.,"Here he finds the scroll of his life ""drawn with large, sharp strokes,"""
1298,GOETHE.,"that is, these truly wise read his character for him, and ""mind and"
1299,GOETHE.,"destiny are but two names for one idea."""
1300,GOETHE.,
1301,GOETHE.,He now knows enough to enter on the Wanderjahre.
1302,GOETHE.,
1303,GOETHE.,Goethe always represents the highest principle in the feminine form.
1304,GOETHE.,"Woman is the Minerva, man the Mars. As in the Faust, the purity of"
1305,GOETHE.,"Gretchen, resisting the demon always, even after all her faults, is"
1306,GOETHE.,announced to have saved her soul to heaven; and in the second part she
1307,GOETHE.,"appears, not only redeemed herself, but by her innocence and forgiving"
1308,GOETHE.,tenderness hallowed to redeem the being who had injured her.
1309,GOETHE.,
1310,GOETHE.,"So in the Meister, these women hover around the narrative, each"
1311,GOETHE.,"embodying the spirit of the scene. The frail Philina, graceful though"
1312,GOETHE.,"contemptible, represents the degradation incident to an attempt at"
1313,GOETHE.,"leading an exclusively poetic life. Mignon, gift divine as ever the Muse"
1314,GOETHE.,"bestowed on the passionate heart of man, with her soft, mysterious"
1315,GOETHE.,"inspiration, her pining for perpetual youth, represents the high desire"
1316,GOETHE.,"that leads to this mistake, as Aurelia, the desire for excitement;"
1317,GOETHE.,"Teresa, practical wisdom, gentle tranquillity, which seem most desirable"
1318,GOETHE.,after the Aurelia glare. Of the beautiful soul and Natalia we have
1319,GOETHE.,already spoken. The former embodies what was suggested to Goethe by
1320,GOETHE.,the most spiritual person he knew in youth--Mademoiselle von
1321,GOETHE.,"Klettenberg, over whom, as he said, in her invalid loneliness the Holy"
1322,GOETHE.,Ghost brooded like a dove.
1323,GOETHE.,
1324,GOETHE.,"Entering on the Wanderjahre, Wilhelm becomes acquainted with another"
1325,GOETHE.,"woman, who seems the complement of all the former, and represents the"
1326,GOETHE.,idea which is to guide and mould him in the realization of all the past
1327,GOETHE.,experience.
1328,GOETHE.,
1329,GOETHE.,"This person, long before we see her, is announced in various ways as a"
1330,GOETHE.,"ruling power. She is the last hope in cases of difficulty, and, though"
1331,GOETHE.,"an invalid, and living in absolute retirement, is consulted by her"
1332,GOETHE.,connections and acquaintance as an unerring judge in all their affairs.
1333,GOETHE.,
1334,GOETHE.,"All things tend towards her as a centre; she knows all, governs all, but"
1335,GOETHE.,never goes forth from herself.
1336,GOETHE.,
1337,GOETHE.,"Wilhelm at last visits her. He finds her infirm in body, but equal to"
1338,GOETHE.,all she has to do. Charity and counsel to men who need her are her
1339,GOETHE.,"business, astronomy her pleasure."
1340,GOETHE.,
1341,GOETHE.,"After a while, Wilhelm ascertains from the Astronomer, her companion,"
1342,GOETHE.,"what he had before suspected, that she really belongs to the solar"
1343,GOETHE.,"system, and only appears on earth to give men a feeling of the planetary"
1344,GOETHE.,"harmony. From her youth up, says the Astronomer, till she knew me,"
1345,GOETHE.,though all recognized in her an unfolding of the highest moral and
1346,GOETHE.,"intellectual qualities, she was supposed to be sick at her times of"
1347,GOETHE.,"clear vision. When her thoughts were not in the heavens, she returned"
1348,GOETHE.,and acted in obedience to them on earth; she was then said to be well.
1349,GOETHE.,
1350,GOETHE.,"When the Astronomer had observed her long enough, he confirmed her"
1351,GOETHE.,inward consciousness of a separate existence and peculiar union with the
1352,GOETHE.,heavenly bodies.
1353,GOETHE.,
1354,GOETHE.,"Her picture is painted with many delicate traits, and a gradual"
1355,GOETHE.,"preparation leads the reader to acknowledge the truth; but, even in the"
1356,GOETHE.,"slight indication here given, who does not recognize thee, divine"
1357,GOETHE.,"Philosophy, sure as the planetary orbits, and inexhaustible as the"
1358,GOETHE.,"fountain of light, crowning the faithful Seeker at last with the"
1359,GOETHE.,privilege to possess his own soul.
1360,GOETHE.,
1361,GOETHE.,"In all that is said of Macaria,[4] we recognize that no thought is too"
1362,GOETHE.,religious for the mind of Goethe. It was indeed so; you can deny him
1363,GOETHE.,"nothing, but only feel that his works are not instinct and glowing with"
1364,GOETHE.,"the central fire, and, after catching a glimpse pf the highest truth,"
1365,GOETHE.,are forced again to find him too much afraid of losing sight of the
1366,GOETHE.,limitations of nature to overflow you or himself with the creative
1367,GOETHE.,spirit.
1368,GOETHE.,
1369,GOETHE.,While the apparition of the celestial Macaria seems to announce the
1370,GOETHE.,"ultimate destiny of the soul of man, the practical application of all"
1371,GOETHE.,Wilhelm has thus painfully acquired is not of pure Delphian strain.
1372,GOETHE.,"Goethe draws, as he passes, a dart from the quiver of Phoebus, but"
1373,GOETHE.,"ends as Æsculapius or Mercury. Wilhelm, at the school of the Three"
1374,GOETHE.,"Reverences, thinks out what can be done for man in his temporal"
1375,GOETHE.,"relations. He learns to practise moderation, and even painful"
1376,GOETHE.,"renunciation. The book ends, simply indicating what the course of his"
1377,GOETHE.,"life will be, by making him perform an act of kindness, with good"
1378,GOETHE.,judgment and at the right moment.
1379,GOETHE.,
1380,GOETHE.,Surely the simple soberness of Goethe should please at least those who
1381,GOETHE.,"style themselves, preëminently, people of common sense."
1382,GOETHE.,
1383,GOETHE.,"The following remarks are by the celebrated Rahel von Ense, whose"
1384,GOETHE.,discernment as to his works was highly prized by Goethe.
1385,GOETHE.,
1386,GOETHE.,
1387,GOETHE.,"""_Don Quixote and Wilhelm Meister_!"
1388,GOETHE.,
1389,GOETHE.,"""Embrace one another, Cervantes and Goethe!"
1390,GOETHE.,
1391,GOETHE.,"""Both, using their own clear eyes, vindicated human nature. They"
1392,GOETHE.,"saw the champions through their errors and follies, looking down"
1393,GOETHE.,"into the deepest soul, seeing there the true form. _Respectable_"
1394,GOETHE.,"people call the Don as well as Meister a fool, wandering hither and"
1395,GOETHE.,"thither, transacting no business of real life, bringing nothing to"
1396,GOETHE.,"pass, scarce even knowing what he ought to think on any subject,"
1397,GOETHE.,very unfit for the hero of a romance. Yet has our sage known how to
1398,GOETHE.,paint the good and honest mind in perpetual toil and conflict with
1399,GOETHE.,"the world, as it is embodied; never sharing one moment the impure"
1400,GOETHE.,"confusion; always striving to find fault with and improve itself,"
1401,GOETHE.,"always so innocent as to see others far better than they are, and"
1402,GOETHE.,"generally preferring them to itself, learning from all, indulging"
1403,GOETHE.,"all except the manifestly base; the more you understand, the more"
1404,GOETHE.,you respect and love this character. Cervantes has painted the
1405,GOETHE.,"knight, Goethe the culture of the entire man,--both their own"
1406,GOETHE.,"time."""
1407,GOETHE.,
1408,GOETHE.,But those who demand from him a life-long continuance of the early ardor
1409,GOETHE.,"of Faust, who wish to see, throughout his works, not only such manifold"
1410,GOETHE.,"beauty and subtle wisdom, but the clear assurance of divinity, the pure"
1411,GOETHE.,"white light of Macaria, wish that he had not so variously unfolded his"
1412,GOETHE.,"nature, and concentred it more. They would see him slaying the serpent"
1413,GOETHE.,"with the divine wrath of Apollo, rather than taming it to his service,"
1414,GOETHE.,"like Æsculapius. They wish that he had never gone to Weimar, had never"
1415,GOETHE.,"become a universal connoisseur and dilettante in science, and courtier"
1416,GOETHE.,"as ""graceful as a born nobleman,"" but had endured the burden of life"
1417,GOETHE.,"with the suffering crowd, and deepened his nature in loneliness and"
1418,GOETHE.,"privation, till Faust had conquered, rather than cheated the devil, and"
1419,GOETHE.,the music of heavenly faith superseded the grave and mild eloquence of
1420,GOETHE.,human wisdom.
1421,GOETHE.,
1422,GOETHE.,The expansive genius which moved so gracefully in its self imposed
1423,GOETHE.,"fetters, is constantly surprising us by its content with a choice low,"
1424,GOETHE.,in so far as it was not the highest of which the mind was capable. The
1425,GOETHE.,secret may be found in the second motto of this slight essay.
1426,GOETHE.,
1427,GOETHE.,"""He who would do great things must quickly draw together his forces. The"
1428,GOETHE.,"master can only show himself such through limitation, and the law alone"
1429,GOETHE.,"can give us freedom."""
1430,GOETHE.,
1431,GOETHE.,But there is a higher spiritual law always ready to supersede the
1432,GOETHE.,temporal laws at the call of the human soul. The soul that is too
1433,GOETHE.,content with usual limitations will never call forth this unusual
1434,GOETHE.,manifestation.
1435,GOETHE.,
1436,GOETHE.,"If there be a tide in the affairs of men, which must be taken at the"
1437,GOETHE.,"right moment to lead on to fortune, it is the same with inward as with"
1438,GOETHE.,"outward life. He who, in the crisis hour of youth, has stopped short of"
1439,GOETHE.,"himself, is not likely to find again what he has missed in one life, for"
1440,GOETHE.,there are a great number of blanks to a prize in each lottery.
1441,GOETHE.,
1442,GOETHE.,"But the pang we feel that ""those who are so much are not more,"" seems to"
1443,GOETHE.,"promise new spheres, new ages, new crises to enable these beings to"
1444,GOETHE.,complete their circle.
1445,GOETHE.,
1446,GOETHE.,Perhaps Goethe is even now sensible that he should not have stopped at
1447,GOETHE.,"Weimar as his home, but made it one station on the way to Paradise; not"
1448,GOETHE.,"stopped at humanity, but regarded it as symbolical of the divine, and"
1449,GOETHE.,"given to others to feel more distinctly the centre of the universe, as"
1450,GOETHE.,"well as the harmony in its parts. It is great to be an Artist, a Master,"
1451,GOETHE.,greater still to be a Seeker till the Man has found all himself.
1452,GOETHE.,
1453,GOETHE.,What Goethe meant by self-collection was a collection of means for
1454,GOETHE.,"work, rather than to divine the deepest truths of being. Thus are these"
1455,GOETHE.,"truths always indicated, never declared; and the religious hope awakened"
1456,GOETHE.,"by his subtle discernment of the workings of nature never gratified,"
1457,GOETHE.,except through the intellect.
1458,GOETHE.,
1459,GOETHE.,He whose prayer is only work will not leave his treasure in the secret
1460,GOETHE.,shrine.
1461,GOETHE.,
1462,GOETHE.,"One is ashamed when finding any fault with one like Goethe, who is so"
1463,GOETHE.,"great. It seems the only criticism should be to do all he omitted to do,"
1464,GOETHE.,and that none who cannot is entitled to say a word. Let that one speak
1465,GOETHE.,"who was all Goethe was not,--noble, true, virtuous, but neither wise"
1466,GOETHE.,"nor subtle in his generation, a divine ministrant, a baffled man, ruled"
1467,GOETHE.,"and imposed on by the pygmies whom he spurned, an heroic artist, a"
1468,GOETHE.,democrat to the tune of Burns:
1469,GOETHE.,
1470,GOETHE.,"""The rank is but the guinea's stamp;"
1471,GOETHE.,"The man's the gowd for a' that."""
1472,GOETHE.,
1473,GOETHE.,Hear Beethoven speak of Goethe on an occasion which brought out the
1474,GOETHE.,two characters in strong contrast.
1475,GOETHE.,
1476,GOETHE.,"Extract from a letter of Beethoven to Bettina Brentano Töplitz, 1812."
1477,GOETHE.,
1478,GOETHE.,"""Kings and princes can indeed make professors and privy councillors, and"
1479,GOETHE.,hang upon them titles; but great men they cannot make; souls that rise
1480,GOETHE.,"above the mud of the world, these they must let be made by other means"
1481,GOETHE.,"than theirs, and should therefore show them respect. When two such as I"
1482,GOETHE.,"and Goethe come together, then must great lords observe what is"
1483,GOETHE.,esteemed great by one of us. Coming home yesterday we met the whole
1484,GOETHE.,"imperial family. We saw them coming, and Goethe left me and insisted"
1485,GOETHE.,"on standing one side; let me say what I would, I could not make him come"
1486,GOETHE.,"on one step. I pressed my hat upon my head, buttoned my surtout, and"
1487,GOETHE.,passed on through the thickest crowd. Princes and parasites made way;
1488,GOETHE.,the Archduke Rudolph took off his hat; the empress greeted me first.
1489,GOETHE.,Their highnesses KNOW ME. I was well amused to see the crowd pass by
1490,GOETHE.,"Goethe. At the side stood he, hat in hand, low bowed in reverence till"
1491,GOETHE.,"all had gone by. Then I scolded him well; I gave no pardon, but"
1492,GOETHE.,"reproached him with all his sins, most of all those towards you, dearest"
1493,GOETHE.,"Bettina; we had just been talking of you."""
1494,GOETHE.,
1495,GOETHE.,"If Beethoven appears, in this scene, somewhat arrogant and bearish, yet"
1496,GOETHE.,how noble his extreme compared with the opposite! Goethe's friendship
1497,GOETHE.,"with the grand duke we respect, for Karl August was a strong man. But we"
1498,GOETHE.,regret to see at the command of any and all members of the ducal
1499,GOETHE.,"family, and their connections, who had nothing but rank to recommend"
1500,GOETHE.,"them, his time and thoughts, of which he was so chary to private"
1501,GOETHE.,"friends. Beethoven could not endure to teach the Archduke Rudolph, who"
1502,GOETHE.,"had the soul duly to revere his genius, because he felt it to be"
1503,GOETHE.,"""hofdíenst,"" court service. He received with perfect nonchalance the"
1504,GOETHE.,homage of the sovereigns of Europe. Only the Empress of Russia and the
1505,GOETHE.,"Archduke Karl, whom he esteemed as individuals, had power to gratify him"
1506,GOETHE.,"by their attentions. Compare with, Goethe's obsequious pleasure at"
1507,GOETHE.,"being able gracefully to compliment such high personages, Beethoven's"
1508,GOETHE.,conduct with regard to the famous Heroic Symphony. This was composed at
1509,GOETHE.,"the suggestion of Bernadotte, while Napoleon was still in his first"
1510,GOETHE.,"glory. He was then the hero of Beethoven's imagination, who hoped from"
1511,GOETHE.,him the liberation of Europe. With delight the great artist expressed in
1512,GOETHE.,his eternal harmonies the progress of the Hero's soul. The symphony was
1513,GOETHE.,"finished, and even dedicated to Bonaparte, when the news came of his"
1514,GOETHE.,declaring himself Emperor of the French. The first act of the indignant
1515,GOETHE.,artist was to tear off his dedication and trample it under foot; nor
1516,GOETHE.,could he endure again even the mention of Napoleon until the time of his
1517,GOETHE.,fall.
1518,GOETHE.,
1519,GOETHE.,Admit that Goethe had a natural taste for the trappings of rank and
1520,GOETHE.,"wealth, from which the musician was quite free, yet we cannot doubt that"
1521,GOETHE.,both saw through these externals to man as a nature; there can be no
1522,GOETHE.,"doubt on whose side was the simple greatness, the noble truth. We pardon"
1523,GOETHE.,"thee, Goethe,--but thee, Beethoven, we revere, for thou hast"
1524,GOETHE.,"maintained the worship of the Manly, the Permanent, the True!"
1525,GOETHE.,
1526,GOETHE.,The clear perception which was in Goethe's better nature of the beauty
1527,GOETHE.,"of that steadfastness, of that singleness and simple melody of soul,"
1528,GOETHE.,"which he too much sacrificed to become ""the many-sided One,"" is shown"
1529,GOETHE.,"most distinctly in his two surpassingly beautiful works, The Elective"
1530,GOETHE.,Affinities and Iphigenia.
1531,GOETHE.,
1532,GOETHE.,"Not Werther, not the Nouvelle Héloise, have been assailed with such a"
1533,GOETHE.,"storm of indignation as the first-named of these works, on the score of"
1534,GOETHE.,gross immorality.
1535,GOETHE.,
1536,GOETHE.,The reason probably is the subject; any discussion of the validity of
1537,GOETHE.,"the marriage vow making society tremble to its foundation; and,"
1538,GOETHE.,"secondly, the cold manner in which it is done. All that is in the book"
1539,GOETHE.,would be bearable to most minds if the writer had had less the air of a
1540,GOETHE.,"spectator, and had larded his work here and there with ejaculations of"
1541,GOETHE.,horror and surprise.
1542,GOETHE.,
1543,GOETHE.,These declarations of sentiment on the part of the author seem to be
1544,GOETHE.,"required by the majority of readers, in order to an interpretation of"
1545,GOETHE.,"his purpose, as sixthly, seventhly, and eighthly were, in an"
1546,GOETHE.,"old-fashioned sermon, to rouse the audience to a perception of the"
1547,GOETHE.,method made use of by the preacher.
1548,GOETHE.,
1549,GOETHE.,But it has always seemed to me that those who need not such helps to
1550,GOETHE.,"their discriminating faculties, but read a work so thoroughly as to"
1551,GOETHE.,"apprehend its whole scope and tendency, rather than hear what the author"
1552,GOETHE.,"says it means, will regard the Elective Affinities as a work especially"
1553,GOETHE.,"what is called moral in its outward effect, and religious even to piety"
1554,GOETHE.,in its spirit. The mental aberrations of the consorts from their
1555,GOETHE.,"plighted faith, though in the one case never indulged, and though in the"
1556,GOETHE.,"other no veil of sophistry is cast over the weakness of passion, but all"
1557,GOETHE.,that is felt expressed with the openness of one who desires to
1558,GOETHE.,"legitimate what he feels, are punished by terrible griefs and a fatal"
1559,GOETHE.,"catastrophe. Ottilia, that being of exquisite purity, with intellect and"
1560,GOETHE.,"character so harmonized in feminine beauty, as they never before were"
1561,GOETHE.,"found in any portrait of woman painted by the hand of man, perishes, on"
1562,GOETHE.,"finding she has been breathed on by unhallowed passion, and led to err"
1563,GOETHE.,even by her ignorant wishes against what is held sacred. The only
1564,GOETHE.,"personage whom we do not pity is Edward, for he is the only one who"
1565,GOETHE.,stifles the voice of conscience.
1566,GOETHE.,
1567,GOETHE.,"There is indeed a sadness, as of an irresistible fatality, brooding over"
1568,GOETHE.,the whole. It seems as if only a ray of angelic truth could have enabled
1569,GOETHE.,"these men to walk wisely in this twilight, at first so soft and"
1570,GOETHE.,"alluring, then deepening into blind horror."
1571,GOETHE.,
1572,GOETHE.,"But if no such ray came to prevent their earthly errors, it seems to"
1573,GOETHE.,"point heavenward in the saintly sweetness of Ottilia. Her nature, too"
1574,GOETHE.,"fair for vice, too finely wrought even for error, comes lonely, intense,"
1575,GOETHE.,"and pale, like the evening star on the cold, wintry night. It tells of"
1576,GOETHE.,"other worlds, where the meaning of such strange passages as this must be"
1577,GOETHE.,"read to those faithful and pure like her, victims perishing in the green"
1578,GOETHE.,garlands of a spotless youth to atone for the unworthiness of others.
1579,GOETHE.,
1580,GOETHE.,"An unspeakable pathos is felt from the minutest trait of this character,"
1581,GOETHE.,and deepens with every new study of it. Not even in Shakspeare have I so
1582,GOETHE.,felt the organizing power of genius. Through dead words I find the least
1583,GOETHE.,"gestures of this person, stamping themselves on my memory, betraying to"
1584,GOETHE.,"the heart the secret of her life, which she herself, like all these"
1585,GOETHE.,"divine beings, knew not. I feel myself familiarized with all beings of"
1586,GOETHE.,"her order. I see not only what she was, but what she might have been,"
1587,GOETHE.,and live with her in yet untrodden realms.
1588,GOETHE.,
1589,GOETHE.,Here is the glorious privilege of a form known only in the world of
1590,GOETHE.,genius. There is on it no stain of usage or calculation to dull our
1591,GOETHE.,"sense of its immeasurable life. What in our daily walk, mid common faces"
1592,GOETHE.,"and common places, fleets across us at moments from glances of the eye,"
1593,GOETHE.,"or tones of the voice, is felt from the whole being of one of these"
1594,GOETHE.,children of genius.
1595,GOETHE.,
1596,GOETHE.,This precious gem is set in a ring complete in its enamel. I cannot hope
1597,GOETHE.,to express my sense of the beauty of this book as a work of art. I
1598,GOETHE.,would not attempt it if I had elsewhere met any testimony to the same.
1599,GOETHE.,"The perfect picture, always before the mind, of the chateau, the moss"
1600,GOETHE.,"hut, the park, the garden, the lake, with its boat and the landing"
1601,GOETHE.,beneath the platan trees; the gradual manner in which both localities
1602,GOETHE.,"and persons grow upon us, more living than life, inasmuch as we are,"
1603,GOETHE.,"unconsciously, kept at our best temperature by the atmosphere of genius,"
1604,GOETHE.,and thereby more delicate in our perceptions than amid our customary
1605,GOETHE.,"fogs; the gentle unfolding of the central thought, as a flower in the"
1606,GOETHE.,"morning sun; then the conclusion, rising like a cloud, first soft and"
1607,GOETHE.,"white, but darkening as it comes, till with a sudden wind it bursts"
1608,GOETHE.,above our heads; the ease with which we every where find points of view
1609,GOETHE.,"all different, yet all bearing on the same circle, for, though we feel"
1610,GOETHE.,"every hour new worlds, still before our eye lie the same objects, new,"
1611,GOETHE.,"yet the same, unchangeable, yet always changing their aspects as we"
1612,GOETHE.,"proceed, till at last we find we ourselves have traversed the circle,"
1613,GOETHE.,"and know all we overlooked at first,--these things are worthy of our"
1614,GOETHE.,highest admiration.
1615,GOETHE.,
1616,GOETHE.,"For myself, I never felt so completely that very thing which genius"
1617,GOETHE.,"should always make us feel--that I was in its circle, and could not get"
1618,GOETHE.,"out till its spell was done, and its last spirit permitted to depart. I"
1619,GOETHE.,"was not carried away, instructed, delighted more than by other works,"
1620,GOETHE.,"but I was _there_, living there, whether as the platan tree, or the"
1621,GOETHE.,"architect, or any other observing part of the scene. The personages live"
1622,GOETHE.,too intensely to let us live in them; they draw around themselves
1623,GOETHE.,"circles within the circle; we can only see them close, not be"
1624,GOETHE.,themselves.
1625,GOETHE.,
1626,GOETHE.,"Others, it would seem, on closing the book, exclaim, ""What an immoral"
1627,GOETHE.,"book!"" I well remember my own thought, ""It is a work of art!"" At last I"
1628,GOETHE.,"understood that world within a world, that ripest fruit of human nature,"
1629,GOETHE.,which is called art. With each perusal of the book my surprise and
1630,GOETHE.,delight at this wonderful fulfilment of design grew. I understood why
1631,GOETHE.,"Goethe was well content to be called Artist, and his works, works of"
1632,GOETHE.,"Art, rather than revelations. At this moment, remembering what I then"
1633,GOETHE.,"felt, I am inclined to class all my negations just written on this paper"
1634,GOETHE.,"as stuff, and to look upon myself, for thinking them, with as much"
1635,GOETHE.,"contempt as Mr. Carlyle, or Mrs. Austin, or Mrs. Jameson might do, to"
1636,GOETHE.,say nothing of the German Goetheans.
1637,GOETHE.,
1638,GOETHE.,Yet that they were not without foundation I feel again when I turn to
1639,GOETHE.,the Iphigenia--a work beyond the possibility of negation; a work where a
1640,GOETHE.,religious meaning not only pierces but enfolds the whole; a work as
1641,GOETHE.,"admirable in art, still higher in significance, more single in"
1642,GOETHE.,expression.
1643,GOETHE.,
1644,GOETHE.,There is an English translation (I know not how good) of Goethe's
1645,GOETHE.,"Iphigenia. But as it may not be generally known, I will give a sketch of"
1646,GOETHE.,"the drama. Iphigenia, saved, at the moment of the sacrifice made by"
1647,GOETHE.,"Agamemnon in behalf of the Greeks, by the goddess, and transferred to"
1648,GOETHE.,"the temple at Tauris, appears alone in the consecrated grove. Many years"
1649,GOETHE.,"have passed since she was severed from the home of such a tragic fate,"
1650,GOETHE.,"the palace of Mycenæ. Troy had fallen, Agamemnon been murdered, Orestes"
1651,GOETHE.,had grown up to avenge his death. All these events were unknown to the
1652,GOETHE.,"exiled Iphigenia. The priestess of Diana in a barbarous land, she had"
1653,GOETHE.,"passed the years in the duties of the sanctuary, and in acts of"
1654,GOETHE.,"beneficence. She had acquired great power over the mind of Thoas, king"
1655,GOETHE.,"of Tauris, and used it to protect strangers, whom it had previously been"
1656,GOETHE.,the custom of the country to sacrifice to the goddess.
1657,GOETHE.,
1658,GOETHE.,"She salutes us with a soliloquy, of which I give a rude translation:--"
1659,GOETHE.,
1660,GOETHE.,"Beneath your shade, living summits"
1661,GOETHE.,"Of this ancient, holy, thick-leaved grove,"
1662,GOETHE.,"As in the silent sanctuary of the Goddess,"
1663,GOETHE.,"Still I walk with those same shuddering feelings,"
1664,GOETHE.,As when I trod these walks for the first time.
1665,GOETHE.,My spirit cannot accustom itself to these places;
1666,GOETHE.,Many years now has kept me here concealed
1667,GOETHE.,"A higher will, to which I am submissive;"
1668,GOETHE.,"Yet ever am I, as at first, the stranger;"
1669,GOETHE.,"For ah! the sea divides me from my beloved ones,"
1670,GOETHE.,"And on the shore whole days I stand,"
1671,GOETHE.,"Seeking with my soul the land of the Greeks,"
1672,GOETHE.,And to my sighs brings the rushing wave only
1673,GOETHE.,Its hollow tones in answer.
1674,GOETHE.,"Woe to him who, far from parents, and brothers, and sisters,"
1675,GOETHE.,Drags on a lonely life. Grief consumes
1676,GOETHE.,The nearest happiness away from his lips;
1677,GOETHE.,His thoughts crowd downwards--
1678,GOETHE.,"Seeking the hall of his fathers, where the Sun"
1679,GOETHE.,"First opened heaven to him, and kindred-born"
1680,GOETHE.,In their first plays knit daily firmer and firmer
1681,GOETHE.,"The bond from heart to heart--I question not the Gods,"
1682,GOETHE.,Only the lot of woman is one of sorrow;
1683,GOETHE.,"In the house and in the war man rules,"
1684,GOETHE.,"Knows how to help himself in foreign lands,"
1685,GOETHE.,"Possessions gladden and victory crowns him,"
1686,GOETHE.,And an honorable death stands ready to end his days.
1687,GOETHE.,Within what narrow limits is bounded the luck of woman!
1688,GOETHE.,To obey a rude husband even is duty and comfort; how sad
1689,GOETHE.,"When, instead, a hostile fate drives her out of her sphere!"
1690,GOETHE.,"So holds me Thoas, indeed a noble man, fast"
1691,GOETHE.,"In solemn, sacred, but slavish bonds."
1692,GOETHE.,"O, with shame I confess that with secret reluctance"
1693,GOETHE.,"I serve thee, Goddess, thee, my deliverer."
1694,GOETHE.,"My life should freely have been dedicate to thee,"
1695,GOETHE.,"But I have always been hoping in thee, O Diana,"
1696,GOETHE.,"Who didst take in thy soft arms me, the rejected daughter"
1697,GOETHE.,"Of the greatest king! Yes, daughter of Zeus,"
1698,GOETHE.,"I thought if thou gavest such anguish to him, the high hero,"
1699,GOETHE.,The godlike Agamemnon;
1700,GOETHE.,"Since he brought his dearest, a victim, to thy altar,"
1701,GOETHE.,"That, when he should return, crowned with glory, from Ilium,"
1702,GOETHE.,"At the same time thou would'st give to his arms his other treasures,"
1703,GOETHE.,"His spouse, Electra, and the princely son;"
1704,GOETHE.,"Me also, thou would'st restore to mine own,"
1705,GOETHE.,"Saving a second time me, whom from death thou didst save,"
1706,GOETHE.,"From this worse death,--the life of exile here."
1707,GOETHE.,
1708,GOETHE.,These are the words and thoughts; but how give an idea of the sweet
1709,GOETHE.,"simplicity of expression in the original, where every word has the grace"
1710,GOETHE.,and softness of a flower petal?
1711,GOETHE.,
1712,GOETHE.,"She is interrupted by a messenger from the king, who prepares her for a"
1713,GOETHE.,"visit from himself of a sort she has dreaded. Thoas, who has always"
1714,GOETHE.,"loved her, now left childless by the calamities of war, can no longer"
1715,GOETHE.,resist his desire to reanimate by her presence his desert house. He
1716,GOETHE.,"begins by urging her to tell him the story of her race, which she does"
1717,GOETHE.,in a way that makes us feel as if that most famous tragedy had never
1718,GOETHE.,"before found a voice, so simple, so fresh in its naïveté is the recital."
1719,GOETHE.,
1720,GOETHE.,Thoas urges his suit undismayed by the fate that hangs over the race of
1721,GOETHE.,Tantalus.
1722,GOETHE.,
1723,THOAS.,THOAS.
1724,THOAS.,
1725,THOAS.,"Was it the same Tantalus,"
1726,THOAS.,"Whom Jupiter called to his council and banquets,"
1727,THOAS.,"In whose talk so deeply experienced, full of various learning,"
1728,THOAS.,The Gods delighted as in the speech of oracles?

1731,IPHIGENIA.,
1732,IPHIGENIA.,"It is the same, but the Gods should not"
1733,IPHIGENIA.,"Converse with men, as with their equals."
1734,IPHIGENIA.,The mortal race is much too weak
1735,IPHIGENIA.,Not to turn giddy on unaccustomed heights.
1736,IPHIGENIA.,"He was not ignoble, neither a traitor,"
1737,IPHIGENIA.,"But for a servant too great, and as a companion"
1738,IPHIGENIA.,Of the great Thunderer only a man. So was
1739,IPHIGENIA.,"His fault also that of a man, its penalty"
1740,IPHIGENIA.,"Severe, and poets sing--Presumption"
1741,IPHIGENIA.,"And faithlessness cast him down from the throne of Jove,"
1742,IPHIGENIA.,Into the anguish of ancient Tartarus;
1743,IPHIGENIA.,"Ah, and all his race bore their hate."
1744,IPHIGENIA.,
1745,THOAS.,THOAS.
1746,THOAS.,
1747,THOAS.,"Bore it the blame of the ancestor, or its own?"
1748,THOAS.,
1749,IPHIGENIA.,IPHIGENIA.
1750,IPHIGENIA.,
1751,IPHIGENIA.,Truly the vehement breast and powerful life of the Titan
1752,IPHIGENIA.,Were the assured inheritance of son and grandchild;
1753,IPHIGENIA.,"But the Gods bound their brows with a brazen band,"
1754,IPHIGENIA.,"Moderation, counsel, wisdom, and patience"
1755,IPHIGENIA.,"Were hid from their wild, gloomy glance,"
1756,IPHIGENIA.,"Each desire grew to fury,"
1757,IPHIGENIA.,And limitless ranged their passionate thoughts.
1758,IPHIGENIA.,
1759,IPHIGENIA.,Iphigenia refuses with gentle firmness to give to gratitude what was not
1760,IPHIGENIA.,"due. Thoas leaves her in anger, and, to make her feel it, orders that"
1761,IPHIGENIA.,"the old, barbarous custom be renewed, and two strangers just arrived be"
1762,IPHIGENIA.,immolated at Diana's altar.
1763,IPHIGENIA.,
1764,IPHIGENIA.,"Iphigenia, though distressed, is not shaken by this piece of tyranny."
1765,IPHIGENIA.,She trusts her heavenly protectress will find some way for her to save
1766,IPHIGENIA.,these unfortunates without violating her truth.
1767,IPHIGENIA.,
1768,IPHIGENIA.,"The strangers are Orestes and Pylades, sent thither by the oracle of"
1769,IPHIGENIA.,"Apollo, who bade them go to Tauris and bring back ""The Sister;"" thus"
1770,IPHIGENIA.,"shall the heaven-ordained parricide of Orestes be expiated, and the"
1771,IPHIGENIA.,Furies cease to pursue him.
1772,IPHIGENIA.,
1773,IPHIGENIA.,"The Sister they interpret to be Dian, Apollo's sister; but Iphigenia,"
1774,IPHIGENIA.,"sister to Orestes, is really meant."
1775,IPHIGENIA.,
1776,IPHIGENIA.,"The next act contains scenes of most delicate workmanship, first between"
1777,IPHIGENIA.,"the light-hearted Pylades, full of worldly resource and ready"
1778,IPHIGENIA.,"tenderness, and the suffering Orestes, of far nobler, indeed heroic"
1779,IPHIGENIA.,"nature, but less fit for the day and more for the ages. In the first"
1780,IPHIGENIA.,"scene the characters of both are brought out with great skill, and the"
1781,IPHIGENIA.,"nature of the bond between ""the butterfly and the dark flower,"""
1782,IPHIGENIA.,distinctly shown in few words.
1783,IPHIGENIA.,
1784,IPHIGENIA.,"The next scene is between Iphigenia and Pylades. Pylades, though he"
1785,IPHIGENIA.,truly answers the questions of the priestess about the fate of Troy and
1786,IPHIGENIA.,"the house of Agamemnon, does not hesitate to conceal from her who"
1787,IPHIGENIA.,"Orestes really is, and manufactures a tissue of useless falsehoods with"
1788,IPHIGENIA.,the same readiness that the wise Ulysses showed in exercising his
1789,IPHIGENIA.,ingenuity on similar occasions.
1790,IPHIGENIA.,
1791,IPHIGENIA.,"It is said, I know not how truly, that the modern Greeks are Ulyssean in"
1792,IPHIGENIA.,"this respect, never telling straightforward truth, when deceit will"
1793,IPHIGENIA.,"answer the purpose; and if they tell any truth, practising the economy"
1794,IPHIGENIA.,"of the King of Ithaca, in always reserving a part for their own use. The"
1795,IPHIGENIA.,character which this denotes is admirably hit off with few strokes in
1796,IPHIGENIA.,"Pylades, the fair side of whom Iphigenia thus paints in a later scene."
1797,IPHIGENIA.,
1798,IPHIGENIA.,"Bless, ye Gods, our Pylades,"
1799,IPHIGENIA.,And whatever he may undertake;
1800,IPHIGENIA.,"He is the arm of the youth in battle,"
1801,IPHIGENIA.,The light-giving eye of the aged man in the council.
1802,IPHIGENIA.,For his soul is still; it preserves
1803,IPHIGENIA.,"The holy possession of Repose unexhausted,"
1804,IPHIGENIA.,And from its depths still reaches
1805,IPHIGENIA.,Help and advice to those tossed to and fro.
1806,IPHIGENIA.,
1807,IPHIGENIA.,"Iphigenia leaves him in sudden agitation, when informed of the death of"
1808,IPHIGENIA.,"Agamemnon. Returning, she finds in his place Orestes, whom she had not"
1809,IPHIGENIA.,"before seen, and draws from him by her artless questions the sequel to"
1810,IPHIGENIA.,this terrible drama wrought by his hand. After he has concluded his
1811,IPHIGENIA.,"narrative, in the deep tones of cold anguish, she cries,--"
1812,IPHIGENIA.,
1813,IPHIGENIA.,"Immortals, you who through your bright days"
1814,IPHIGENIA.,"Live in bliss, throned on clouds ever renewed,"
1815,IPHIGENIA.,Only for this have you all these years
1816,IPHIGENIA.,"Kept me separate from men, and so near yourselves,"
1817,IPHIGENIA.,"Given me the child-like employment to cherish the fires on your altars,"
1818,IPHIGENIA.,"That my soul might, in like pious clearness,"
1819,IPHIGENIA.,"Be ever aspiring towards your abodes,"
1820,IPHIGENIA.,That only later and deeper I might feel
1821,IPHIGENIA.,The anguish and horror that have darkened my house.
1822,IPHIGENIA.,"O Stranger,"
1823,IPHIGENIA.,"Speak to me of the unhappy one, tell me of Orestes."

1826,ORESTES.,
1827,ORESTES.,"O, might I speak of his death!"
1828,ORESTES.,Vehement flew up from the reeking blood
1829,ORESTES.,His Mother's Soul!
1830,ORESTES.,"And called to the ancient daughters of Night,"
1831,ORESTES.,Let not the parricide escape;
1832,ORESTES.,Pursue that man of crime; he is yours!
1833,ORESTES.,"They obey, their hollow eyes"
1834,ORESTES.,Darting about with vulture eagerness;
1835,ORESTES.,"They stir themselves in their black dens,"
1836,ORESTES.,From corners their companions
1837,ORESTES.,Doubt and Remorse steal out to join them.
1838,ORESTES.,Before them roll the mists of Acheron;
1839,ORESTES.,In its cloudy volumes rolls
1840,ORESTES.,The eternal contemplation of the irrevocable
1841,ORESTES.,Permitted now in their love of ruin they tread
1842,ORESTES.,"The beautiful fields of a God-planted earth,"
1843,ORESTES.,"From which they had long been banished by an early curse,"

1878,ORESTES.,"Like all pure productions of genius, this may be injured by the"
1879,ORESTES.,"slightest change, and I dare not flatter myself that the English words"
1880,ORESTES.,give an idea of the heroic dignity expressed in the cadence of the
1881,ORESTES.,"original, by the words"
1882,ORESTES.,
1883,ORESTES.,"""Twischen uns"
1884,ORESTES.,Seg Wahrheit!
1885,ORESTES.,"Ich bin Orest!"""
1886,ORESTES.,
1887,ORESTES.,where the Greek seems to fold his robe around him in the full strength
1888,ORESTES.,"of classic manhood, prepared for worst and best, not like a cold Stoic,"
1889,ORESTES.,"but a hero, who can feel all, know all, and endure all. The name of two"

1899,ORESTES.,The scenes go on more and more full of breathing beauty. The lovely joy
1900,ORESTES.,"of Iphigenia, the meditative softness with which the religiously"
1901,ORESTES.,educated mind perpetually draws the inference from the most agitating
1902,ORESTES.,"events, impress us more and more. At last the hour of trial comes. She"
1903,ORESTES.,"is to keep off Thoas by a cunningly devised tale, while her brother and"
1904,ORESTES.,Pylades contrive their escape. Orestes has received to his heart the
1905,ORESTES.,"sister long lost, divinely restored, and in the embrace the curse falls"
1906,ORESTES.,"from him, he is well, and Pylades more than happy. The ship waits to"
1907,ORESTES.,carry her to the palace home she is to free from a century's weight of
1908,ORESTES.,pollution; and already the blue heavens of her adored Greece gleam
1909,ORESTES.,before her fancy.
1910,ORESTES.,
1911,ORESTES.,"But, O, the step before all this can be obtained;--to deceive Thoas, a"
1912,ORESTES.,"savage and a tyrant indeed, but long her protector,--in his barbarous"
1913,ORESTES.,"fashion, her benefactor! How can she buy life, happiness, or even the"
1914,ORESTES.,safety of those dear ones at such a price?
1915,ORESTES.,
1916,ORESTES.,"""Woe,"
1917,ORESTES.,"O Woe upon the lie! It frees not the breast,"

1927,ORESTES.,"All things decay, the fairest bliss is transient,"
1928,ORESTES.,The powers most full of life grow faint at last;
1929,ORESTES.,And shall a curse alone boast an incessant life?
1930,ORESTES.,
1931,ORESTES.,"Then have I idly hoped that here kept pure,"
1932,ORESTES.,"So strangely severed from my kindred's lot,"
1933,ORESTES.,"I was designed to come at the right moment,"
1934,ORESTES.,And with pure hand and heart to expiate
1935,ORESTES.,The many sins that stain my native home.
1936,ORESTES.,"To lie, to steal the sacred image!"
1937,ORESTES.,"Olympians, let not these vulture talons"
1938,ORESTES.,"Seize on the tender breast. O, save me,"
1939,ORESTES.,And save your image in my soul!
1940,ORESTES.,
1941,ORESTES.,"Within my ears resounds the ancient lay,--"
1942,ORESTES.,"I had forgotten it, and would so gladly,--"
1943,ORESTES.,"The lay of the Parcæ, which they awful sung;"
1944,ORESTES.,As Tantalus fell from his golden seat
1945,ORESTES.,They suffered with the noble friend. Wrathful
1946,ORESTES.,"Was their heart, and fearful was the song."
1947,ORESTES.,In our childhood the nurse was wont to sing it
1948,ORESTES.,"To me, and my brother and sister. I marked it well."
1949,ORESTES.,
1950,ORESTES.,"Then follows the sublime song of the Parcæ, well known through"
1951,ORESTES.,translations.
1952,ORESTES.,
1953,ORESTES.,"But Iphigenia is not a victim of fate, for she listens steadfastly to"
1954,ORESTES.,the god in her breast. Her lips are incapable of subterfuge. She obeys
1955,ORESTES.,"her own heart, tells all to the king, calls up his better nature, wins,"
1956,ORESTES.,"hallows, and purifies all around her, till the heaven-prepared way is"
1957,ORESTES.,"cleared by the obedient child of heaven, and the great trespass of"
1958,ORESTES.,Tantalus cancelled by a woman's reliance on the voice of her innocent

1961,ORESTES.,If it be not possible to enhance the beauty with which such ideal
1962,ORESTES.,"figures as the Iphigenia and the Antigone appeared to the Greek mind,"
1963,ORESTES.,"yet Goethe has unfolded a part of the life of this being, unknown"
1964,ORESTES.,"elsewhere in the records of literature. The character of the priestess,"
1965,ORESTES.,"the full beauty of virgin womanhood, solitary, but tender, wise and"
1966,ORESTES.,"innocent, sensitive and self-collected, sweet as spring, dignified as"
1967,ORESTES.,"becomes the chosen servant of God, each gesture and word of deep and"
1968,ORESTES.,"delicate significance,--where else is such a picture to be found?"
1969,ORESTES.,
1970,ORESTES.,"It was not the courtier, nor the man of the world, nor the connoisseur,"
1971,ORESTES.,"nor the friend of Mephistopheles, nor Wilhelm the Master, nor Egmont the"
1972,ORESTES.,"generous, free liver, that saw Iphigenia in the world of spirits, but"
1973,ORESTES.,"Goethe, in his first-born glory; G[o]ethe, the poet; Goethe,"
1974,ORESTES.,"designed to be the brightest star in a new constellation. Let us not, in"
1975,ORESTES.,"surveying his works and life, abide with him too much in the suburbs and"
1976,ORESTES.,"outskirts of himself. Let us enter into his higher tendency, thank him"
1977,ORESTES.,"for such angels as Iphigenia, whose simple truth mocks at all his wise"
1978,ORESTES.,"""Beschrankungen,"" and hope the hour when, girt about with many such, he"
1979,ORESTES.,"will confess, contrary to his opinion, given in his latest days, that it"

1987,THOMAS HOOD.,
1988,THOMAS HOOD.,
1989,THOMAS HOOD.,Now almost the last light has gone out of the galaxy that made the first
1990,THOMAS HOOD.,thirty years of this age so bright. And the dynasty that now reigns over
1991,THOMAS HOOD.,"the world of wit and poetry is poor and pale, indeed, in comparison."
1992,THOMAS HOOD.,
1993,THOMAS HOOD.,We are anxious to pour due libations to the departed; we need not
1994,THOMAS HOOD.,economize our wine; it will not be so often needed now.
1995,THOMAS HOOD.,
1996,THOMAS HOOD.,Hood has closed the most fatiguing career in the world--that of a
1997,THOMAS HOOD.,professed wit; and we may say with deeper feeling than of others who
1998,THOMAS HOOD.,"shuffle off the load of care, May he rest in peace! The fatigues of a"
1999,THOMAS HOOD.,"conqueror, a missionary preacher, even of an active philanthropist, like"
2000,THOMAS HOOD.,"Howard, are nothing to those of a professed wit. Bad enough is it when"
2001,THOMAS HOOD.,"he is only a man of society, by whom every one expects to be enlivened"
2002,THOMAS HOOD.,"and relieved; who can never talk gravely in a corner, without those"
2003,THOMAS HOOD.,around observing that he must have heard some bad news to be so out of
2004,THOMAS HOOD.,"spirits; who can never make a simple remark, while eating a peaceful"
2005,THOMAS HOOD.,"dinner, without the table being set in a roar of laughter, as when"
2006,THOMAS HOOD.,"Sheridan, on such an occasion, opened his lips for the first time to say"
2007,THOMAS HOOD.,"that ""he liked currant jelly."" For these unhappy men there are no"
2008,THOMAS HOOD.,"intervals of social repose, no long silences fed by the mere feeling of"
2009,THOMAS HOOD.,"sympathy or gently entertained by observation, no warm quietude in the"
2010,THOMAS HOOD.,"mild liveries of green or brown, for the world has made up its mind that"
2011,THOMAS HOOD.,"motley is their only wear, and teases them to jingle their bells"
2012,THOMAS HOOD.,forever.
2013,THOMAS HOOD.,
2014,THOMAS HOOD.,But far worse is it when the professed wit is also by profession a
2015,THOMAS HOOD.,"writer, and finds himself obliged to coin for bread those jokes which,"
2016,THOMAS HOOD.,"in the frolic exuberance of youth, he so easily coined for fun. We can"
2017,THOMAS HOOD.,"conceive of no existence more cruel, so tormenting, and at the same time"
2018,THOMAS HOOD.,so dull. We hear that Hood was forever behindhand with his promises to
2019,THOMAS HOOD.,"publishers; no wonder! But when we hear that he, in consequence, lost a"
2020,THOMAS HOOD.,"great part of the gains of his hard life, and was, as a result, harassed"
2021,THOMAS HOOD.,"by other cares, we cannot mourn to lose him, if,"
2022,THOMAS HOOD.,
2023,THOMAS HOOD.,"""After life's fitful fever, he sleeps well;"""
2024,THOMAS HOOD.,
2025,THOMAS HOOD.,"or if, as our deeper knowledge leads us to hope, he is now engaged in a"
2026,THOMAS HOOD.,"better life, where his fancies shall take their natural place, and"
2027,THOMAS HOOD.,flicker like light on the surface of a profound and full stream flowing
2028,THOMAS HOOD.,"betwixt rich and peaceful shores, such as, no less than the drawbacks"
2029,THOMAS HOOD.,"upon his earthly existence, are indicated in the following"
2030,THOMAS HOOD.,
2031,SONNET.,SONNET.
2032,SONNET.,
2033,SONNET.,"The curse of Adam, the old curse of all,"
2034,SONNET.,Though I inherit in this feverish life
2035,SONNET.,"Of worldly toil, vain wishes, and hard strife,"
2036,SONNET.,"And fruitless thought in care's eternal thrall,"
2037,SONNET.,Yet more sweet honey than of bitter gall
2038,SONNET.,"I taste through thee, my Eva, my sweet wife."
2039,SONNET.,Then what was Man's lost Paradise? how rife
2040,SONNET.,"Of bliss, since love is with him in his fall!"
2041,SONNET.,Such as our own pure passion still might frame
2042,SONNET.,"Of this fair earth and its delightful bowers,"
2043,SONNET.,"If no fell sorrow, like the serpent, came"
2044,SONNET.,To trail its venom o'er the sweetest flowers;
2045,SONNET.,"But, O! as many and such tears are ours"
2046,SONNET.,As only should be shed for guilt and shame.
2047,SONNET.,
2048,SONNET.,"In Hood, as in all true wits, the smile lightens on the verge of a tear."
2049,SONNET.,True wit and humor show that exquisite sensibility to the relations of
2050,SONNET.,"life, that fine perception as to slight tokens of its fearful, hopeless"
2051,SONNET.,"mysteries, which imply pathos to a still higher degree than mirth."
2052,SONNET.,
2053,SONNET.,"Hood knew and welcomed the dower which nature gave him at his birth,"
2054,SONNET.,when he wrote thus:--
2055,SONNET.,
2056,SONNET.,All things are touched with melancholy
2057,SONNET.,"Born of the secret soul's mistrust,"
2058,SONNET.,To feel her fair ethereal wings
2059,SONNET.,"Weighed down with vile, degraded dust."
2060,SONNET.,Even the bright extremes of joy
2061,SONNET.,"Bring on conclusions of disgust,"
2062,SONNET.,"Like the sweet blossoms of the May,"
2063,SONNET.,Whose fragrance ends in must.
2064,SONNET.,"O, give her, then, her tribute just,"
2065,SONNET.,Her sighs and tears and musings holy;
2066,SONNET.,There is no music in the life
2067,SONNET.,That sounds with idiot laughter solely;
2068,SONNET.,"There's not a string attuned to mirth,"
2069,SONNET.,But has its chord in melancholy.
2070,SONNET.,
2071,SONNET.,Hood was true to this vow of acceptance. He vowed to accept willingly
2072,SONNET.,"the pains as well as joys of life for what they could teach. Therefore,"
2073,SONNET.,"years expanded and enlarged his sympathies, and gave to his lightest"
2074,SONNET.,"jokes an obvious harmony with a great moral design, not obtrusively"
2075,SONNET.,"obvious, but enough so to give a sweetness and permanent complacency to"
2076,SONNET.,"our laughter. Indeed, what is written in his gayer mood has affected us"
2077,SONNET.,"more, as spontaneous productions always do, than what he has written of"
2078,SONNET.,"late with grave design, and which has been so much lauded by men too"
2079,SONNET.,"obtuse to discern a latent meaning, or to believe in a good purpose"
2080,SONNET.,unless they are formally told that it exists.
2081,SONNET.,
2082,SONNET.,The later serious poems of Hood are well known; so are his jest books
2083,SONNET.,and novel. We have now in view to speak rather of a little volume of
2084,SONNET.,"poems published by him, some years since, republished here, but never"
2085,SONNET.,widely circulated.
2086,SONNET.,
2087,SONNET.,"When a book or a person comes to us in the best possible circumstances,"
2088,SONNET.,"we judge--not too favorably, for all that the book or person can suggest"
2089,SONNET.,"is a part of its fate, and what is not seen under the most favorable"
2090,SONNET.,circumstances is never quite truly seen either as to promise or
2091,SONNET.,performance--but we form a judgment above what can be the average sense
2092,SONNET.,"of the world in general as to its merits, which may be esteemed, after"
2093,SONNET.,"time enough has elapsed, a tolerably fair estimate of performance,"
2094,SONNET.,though not of promise or suggestion.
2095,SONNET.,
2096,SONNET.,We became acquainted with these poems in one of those country towns
2097,SONNET.,"which would be called, abroad, the most provincial of the province. The"
2098,SONNET.,"inhabitants had lost the simplicity of farmers' habits, without gaining"
2099,SONNET.,"in its place the refinement, the variety, the enlargement of civic life."
2100,SONNET.,Their industry had received little impulse from thought; their amusement
2101,SONNET.,"was gossip. All men find amusement from gossip--literary, artistic, or"
2102,SONNET.,social; but the degrees in it are almost infinite. They were at the
2103,SONNET.,bottom of the scale; they scrutinized their neighbors' characters and
2104,SONNET.,"affairs incessantly, impertinently, and with minds unpurified by higher"
2105,SONNET.,knowledge; consequently the bitter fruits of envy and calumny abounded.
2106,SONNET.,
2107,SONNET.,"In this atmosphere I was detained two months, and among people very"
2108,SONNET.,uncongenial both to my tastes and notions of right. But I had a retreat
2109,SONNET.,of great beauty. The town lay on the bank of a noble river; behind it
2110,SONNET.,towered a high and rocky hill. Thither every afternoon went the lonely
2111,SONNET.,"stranger, to await the fall of the sunset light on the opposite bank of"
2112,SONNET.,the full and rapid stream. It fell like a smile of heavenly joy; the
2113,SONNET.,white sails on the stream glided along like angel thoughts; the town
2114,SONNET.,"itself looked like a fair nest, whence virtue and happiness might soar"
2115,SONNET.,with sweetest song. So looked the scene _from above_; and that hill was
2116,SONNET.,the scene of many an aspiration and many an effort to attain as high a
2117,SONNET.,"point of view for the mental prospect, in the hope that little"
2118,SONNET.,"discrepancies, or what seemed so when on a level with them, might also,"
2119,SONNET.,"from above, be softened into beauty and found subservient to a noble"
2120,SONNET.,design on the whole.
2121,SONNET.,
2122,SONNET.,"This town boasted few books, and the accident which threw Hood's poems"
2123,SONNET.,"in the way of the watcher from the hill, was a very fortunate one. They"
2124,SONNET.,"afforded a true companionship to hours which knew no other, and,"
2125,SONNET.,"perhaps, have since been overrated from association with what they"
2126,SONNET.,answered to or suggested.
2127,SONNET.,
2128,SONNET.,Yet there are surely passages in them which ought to be generally known
2129,SONNET.,and highly prized. And if their highest value be for a few individuals
2130,SONNET.,"with whom they are especially in concord, unlike the really great poems"
2131,SONNET.,"which bring something to all, yet those whom they please will be very"
2132,SONNET.,much pleased.
2133,SONNET.,
2134,SONNET.,Hood never became corrupted into a hack writer. This shows great
2135,SONNET.,"strength under his circumstances. Dickens has fallen, and Sue is"
2136,SONNET.,falling; for few men can sell themselves by inches without losing a
2137,SONNET.,cubit from their stature. But Hood resisted the danger. He never wrote
2138,SONNET.,"when he had nothing to say, he stopped when he had done, and never"
2139,SONNET.,hashed for a second meal old thoughts which had been drained of their
2140,SONNET.,"choicest juices. His heart is truly human, tender, and brave. From the"
2141,SONNET.,absurdities of human nature he argues the possibility of its perfection.
2142,SONNET.,"His black is admirably contrasted with his white, but his love has no"
2143,SONNET.,"converse of hate. His descriptions of nature, if not accurately or"
2144,SONNET.,"profoundly evidencing insight, are unstudied, fond, and reverential."
2145,SONNET.,They are fine reveries about nature.
2146,SONNET.,
2147,SONNET.,He has tried his powers on themes where he had great rivals--in the
2148,SONNET.,"""Plea of the Midsummer Fairies,"" and ""Hero and Leander."" The latter is"
2149,SONNET.,"one of the finest subjects in the world, and one, too, which can never"
2150,SONNET.,wear out as long as each mind shall have its separate ideal of what a
2151,SONNET.,"meeting would be between two perfect lovers, in the full bloom of"
2152,SONNET.,"beauty and youth, under circumstances the most exalting to passion,"
2153,SONNET.,"because the most trying, and with the most romantic accompaniments of"
2154,SONNET.,"scenery. There is room here for the finest expression of love and grief,"
2155,SONNET.,for the wildest remonstrance against fate. Why are they made so lovely
2156,SONNET.,"and so beloved? Why was a flower brought to such perfection, and then"
2157,SONNET.,culled for no use? One of the older English writers has written an
2158,SONNET.,"exquisite poem on this subject, painting a youthful pair, fitted to be"
2159,SONNET.,not only a heaven but a world to one another. Hood had not power to
2160,SONNET.,"paint or conceive such fulness of character; but, in a lesser style, he"
2161,SONNET.,"has written a fine poem. The best part of it, however, is the innocent"
2162,SONNET.,cruelty and grief of the Sea Siren.
2163,SONNET.,
2164,SONNET.,"""Lycus the Centaur"" is also a poem once read never to be forgotten. The"
2165,SONNET.,"hasty trot of the versification, unfit for any other theme, on this"
2166,SONNET.,"betokens well the frightened horse. Its mazy and bewildered imagery,"
2167,SONNET.,"with its countless glancings and glimpses, expressed powerfully the"
2168,SONNET.,"working of the Circean spell, while the note of human sadness, a"
2169,SONNET.,"yearning and condemned human love, thrills through the whole and gives"
2170,SONNET.,it unity.
2171,SONNET.,
2172,SONNET.,"The Sonnets, ""It is not death,"" &c., and that on Silence, are equally"
2173,SONNET.,admirable. Whoever reads these poems will regard Hood as something more
2174,SONNET.,"than a great wit,--as a great poet also."
2175,SONNET.,
2176,SONNET.,"To express this is our present aim, and therefore we shall leave to"
2177,SONNET.,"others, or another time, the retrospect of his comic writings. But"
2178,SONNET.,"having, on the late promptings of love for the departed, looked over"
2179,SONNET.,"these, we have been especially amused with the ""Schoolmistress Abroad,"""
2180,SONNET.,"which was new to us. Miss Crane, a ""she Mentor, stiff as starch, formal"
2181,SONNET.,"as a Dutch ledge, sensitive as a daguerreotype, and so tall, thin, and"
2182,SONNET.,"upright, that supposing the Tree of Knowledge to have been a poplar, she"
2183,SONNET.,"was the very Dryad to have fitted it,"" was left, with a sister little"
2184,SONNET.,better endowed with the pliancy and power of adaptation which the
2185,SONNET.,"exigencies of this varied world-scene demand, in attendance upon a sick"
2186,SONNET.,"father, in a foreign inn, where she cannot make herself understood,"
2187,SONNET.,"because her French is not ""French French, but English French,"" and no"
2188,SONNET.,two things in nature or art can be more unlike. Now look at the position
2189,SONNET.,of the sisters.
2190,SONNET.,
2191,SONNET.,"""The younger, Miss Ruth, was somewhat less disconcerted. She had by her"
2192,SONNET.,"position the greater share in the active duties of Lebanon House, and"
2193,SONNET.,under ordinary circumstances would not have been utterly at a loss what
2194,SONNET.,to do for the comfort or relief of her parent. But in every direction in
2195,SONNET.,"which her instinct and habits would have prompted her to look, the"
2196,SONNET.,_materials_ she sought were deficient. There was no easy chair--no fire
2197,SONNET.,to wheel it to--no cushion to shake up--no cupboard to go to--no female
2198,SONNET.,friend to consult--no Miss Parfitt--no cook--no John to send for the
2199,SONNET.,"doctor--no English--no French--nothing but that dreadful 'Gefullig,' or"
2200,SONNET.,"'Ja Wohl,' and the equally incomprehensible 'Gnadige Frau!'"

2295,BEETHOVEN.[6],"Moscheles."" It is really only a translation of Schindler, and it seems"
2296,BEETHOVEN.[6],"quite unfair to bring Moscheles so much into the foreground, merely"
2297,BEETHOVEN.[6],because his name is celebrated in England. He has only contributed a few
2298,BEETHOVEN.[6],"notes and a short introduction, giving a most pleasing account of his"
2299,BEETHOVEN.[6],own devotion to the Master. Schindler was the trusty friend of
2300,BEETHOVEN.[6],"Beethoven, and one whom he himself elected to write his biography."
2301,BEETHOVEN.[6],"Inadequate as it is, there is that fidelity in the collection of"
2302,BEETHOVEN.[6],"materials which makes it serviceable to our knowledge of Beethoven, and"
2303,BEETHOVEN.[6],we wish it might be reprinted in America. Though there is little
2304,BEETHOVEN.[6],"knowledge of music here, yet so far as any exists in company with a free"
2305,BEETHOVEN.[6],"development of mind, the music of Beethoven is _the_ music which"
2306,BEETHOVEN.[6],"delights, which awakens, which inspires, an infinite hope."
2307,BEETHOVEN.[6],
2308,BEETHOVEN.[6],"This influence of these most profound, bold, original and singular"
2309,BEETHOVEN.[6],"compositions, even upon the uninitiated, above those of a simpler"

2311,BEETHOVEN.[6],"pleasure. For we think its cause lies deep, far beneath fancy, taste,"
2312,BEETHOVEN.[6],"fashion, or any accidental cause."
2313,BEETHOVEN.[6],
2314,BEETHOVEN.[6],It is because there is a real and steady unfolding of certain thoughts
2315,BEETHOVEN.[6],which pervade the civilized world. They strike their roots through to us
2316,BEETHOVEN.[6],beneath the broad Atlantic; and these roots shoot stems upward to the
2317,BEETHOVEN.[6],light wherever the soil allows them free course.

2319,BEETHOVEN.[6],"Our era, which permits of freer inquiry, of bolder experiment, than ever"
2320,BEETHOVEN.[6],"before, and a firmer, broader, basis, may also, we sincerely trust, be"
2321,BEETHOVEN.[6],depended on for nobler discovery and a grander scope of thought.
2322,BEETHOVEN.[6],
2323,BEETHOVEN.[6],Although we sympathize with the sadness of those who lament the decay of
2324,BEETHOVEN.[6],forms and methods round which so many associations have wound their
2325,BEETHOVEN.[6],"tendrils, and understand the sufferings which gentle, tender natures"
2326,BEETHOVEN.[6],"undergo from the forlorn homelessness of a period of doubt, speculation,"
2327,BEETHOVEN.[6],"reconstruction in every way, yet we cannot disjoin ourselves, by one"
2328,BEETHOVEN.[6],"moment's fear or regret, from the advance corps. That body, leagued by"
2329,BEETHOVEN.[6],"an invisible tie, has received too deep an assurance that the spirit is"
2330,BEETHOVEN.[6],"not dead nor sleeping, to look back to the past, even if they must"
2331,BEETHOVEN.[6],advance uniformly through scenes of decay and the rubbish of falling
2332,BEETHOVEN.[6],edifices.
2333,BEETHOVEN.[6],
2334,BEETHOVEN.[6],"But how far it is from being so! How many developments, in various ways,"
2335,BEETHOVEN.[6],of truth! How manifold the aspirations of love! In the church the

2337,BEETHOVEN.[6],"founder--""Love one another;"" in the philosophy of mind, if completeness"
2338,BEETHOVEN.[6],"of system is, as yet, far from being attained, yet mistakes and vain"
2339,BEETHOVEN.[6],"dogmas are set aside, and examinations conducted with intelligence and"
2340,BEETHOVEN.[6],an enlarged discernment of what is due both to God and man. Science
2341,BEETHOVEN.[6],"advances, in some route with colossal strides; new glimpses are daily"
2342,BEETHOVEN.[6],"gained into the arcana of natural history, and the mysteries attendant"
2343,BEETHOVEN.[6],"on the modes of growth, are laid open to our observation; while in"
2344,BEETHOVEN.[6],"chemistry, electricity, magnetism, we seem to be getting nearer to the"
2345,BEETHOVEN.[6],"law of life which governs them, and in astronomy ""fathoming the"
2346,BEETHOVEN.[6],"heavens,"" to use the sublime expression of Herschel, daily to greater"
2347,BEETHOVEN.[6],"depths, we find ourselves admitted to a perception of the universal laws"
2348,BEETHOVEN.[6],"and causes, where harmony, permanence and perfection leave us no excuse"
2349,BEETHOVEN.[6],"for a moment of despondency, while under the guidance of a Power who has"
2350,BEETHOVEN.[6],ordered all so well.
2351,BEETHOVEN.[6],
2352,BEETHOVEN.[6],"Then, if the other arts suffer a temporary paralysis, and"
2353,BEETHOVEN.[6],"notwithstanding the many proofs of talent and genius, we consider that"
2354,BEETHOVEN.[6],"is the case with architecture, painting, and sculpture, music is not"
2355,BEETHOVEN.[6],"only thoroughly vital, but in a state of rapid development. The last"
2356,BEETHOVEN.[6],"hundred years have witnessed a succession of triumphs in this art, the"
2357,BEETHOVEN.[6],"removal of obstructions, the transcending of limits, and the opening new"
2358,BEETHOVEN.[6],"realms of thought, to an extent that makes the infinity of promise and"
2359,BEETHOVEN.[6],hope very present with us. And take notice that the prominent means of
2360,BEETHOVEN.[6],excellence now are not in those ways which give form to thought already
2361,BEETHOVEN.[6],"existent, but which open new realms to thought. Those who live most with"
2362,BEETHOVEN.[6],"the life of their age, feel that it is one not only beautiful, positive,"
2363,BEETHOVEN.[6],"full of suggestion, but vast, flowing, of infinite promise. It is"
2364,BEETHOVEN.[6],"dynamics that interest us now, and from electricity and music we borrow"
2365,BEETHOVEN.[6],the best illustrations of what we know.
2366,BEETHOVEN.[6],
2367,BEETHOVEN.[6],Let no one doubt that these grand efforts at synthesis are capable of as
2368,BEETHOVEN.[6],"strict analysis. Indeed, it is wonderful with what celerity and"
2369,BEETHOVEN.[6],precision the one process follows up the other.
2370,BEETHOVEN.[6],
2371,BEETHOVEN.[6],"Of this great life which has risen from the stalk and the leaf into bud,"
2372,BEETHOVEN.[6],"and will in the course of this age be in full flower, Beethoven is the"
2373,BEETHOVEN.[6],"last and greatest exponent. His music is felt, by every soul whom it"
2374,BEETHOVEN.[6],"affects, to be the explanation of the past and the prophecy of the"
2375,BEETHOVEN.[6],future. It contains the thoughts of the time. A dynasty of great men
2376,BEETHOVEN.[6],"preceded him, each of whom made conquests and accumulated treasures"
2377,BEETHOVEN.[6],"which prepared the way for his successor. Bach, Handel, Hadyn, Mozart,"
2378,BEETHOVEN.[6],were corner-stones of the glorious temple. Who shall succeed Beethoven?
2379,BEETHOVEN.[6],"A host of musicians, full of talent, even of genius, live now he is"
2380,BEETHOVEN.[6],dead; but the greatest among them is confessed by all men to be but of
2381,BEETHOVEN.[6],"Lilliputian size compared with this demigod. Indeed, it should be so! As"
2382,BEETHOVEN.[6],"copious draughts of soul have been given to the earth, as she can quaff"
2383,BEETHOVEN.[6],"for a century or more. Disciples and critics must follow, to gather up"
2384,BEETHOVEN.[6],the gleanings of the golden grain.
2385,BEETHOVEN.[6],
2386,BEETHOVEN.[6],It is observable as an earnest of the great Future which opens for this
2387,BEETHOVEN.[6],"country, that such a genius is so easily and so much appreciated here,"
2388,BEETHOVEN.[6],by those who have not gone through the steps that prepared the way for
2389,BEETHOVEN.[6],"him in Europe. He is felt, because he expresses, in full tones, the"
2390,BEETHOVEN.[6],"thoughts that lie at the heart of our own existence, though we have not"
2391,BEETHOVEN.[6],found means to stammer them as yet. To those who have obtained some clew
2392,BEETHOVEN.[6],"to all this,--and their number is daily on the increase,--this biography"
2393,BEETHOVEN.[6],of Beethoven will be very interesting. They will here find a picture of
2394,BEETHOVEN.[6],"the great man, as he looked and moved in actual life, though imperfectly"
2395,BEETHOVEN.[6],"painted,--as by one who saw the figure from too low a stand-point."
2396,BEETHOVEN.[6],
2397,BEETHOVEN.[6],It will require the united labors of a constellation of minds to paint
2398,BEETHOVEN.[6],"the portrait of Beethoven. That of his face, as seen in life, prefixed"
2399,BEETHOVEN.[6],"to these volumes, is better than any we have seen. It bears tokens of"
2400,BEETHOVEN.[6],"the force, the grandeur, the grotesqueness of his genius, and at the"
2401,BEETHOVEN.[6],same time shows the melancholy that came to him from the great
2402,BEETHOVEN.[6],misfortune of his life--his deafness; and the affectionateness of his
2403,BEETHOVEN.[6],deep heart.
2404,BEETHOVEN.[6],
2405,BEETHOVEN.[6],Moscheles thus gives a very pleasing account of his first cognizance of
2406,BEETHOVEN.[6],Beethoven:--
2407,BEETHOVEN.[6],
2408,BEETHOVEN.[6],"""I had been placed under the guidance and tuition of Dionysius Weber,"
2409,BEETHOVEN.[6],the founder and present director of the Prague Musical Conservatory; and
2410,BEETHOVEN.[6],"he, fearing that in my eagerness to read new music, I might injure the"
2411,BEETHOVEN.[6],"systematic development of my piano-forte playing, prohibited the"
2412,BEETHOVEN.[6],"library, a circulating musical library, and in a plan for my musical"
2413,BEETHOVEN.[6],"education which he laid before my parents, made it an express condition"
2414,BEETHOVEN.[6],"that for three years I should study no other authors but Mozart,"
2415,BEETHOVEN.[6],"Clemente, and S. Bach. I must confess, however, that in spite of such"
2416,BEETHOVEN.[6],"prohibition, I visited the library, gaining access to it through my"
2417,BEETHOVEN.[6],pocket money. It was about this time that I learned from some
2418,BEETHOVEN.[6],"schoolfellows that a young composer had appeared in Vienna, who wrote"
2419,BEETHOVEN.[6],"the oddest stuff possible, such as no one could either play or"
2420,BEETHOVEN.[6],"understand--crazy music, in opposition to all rule; and that this"
2421,BEETHOVEN.[6],composer's name was Beethoven. On repairing to the library to satisfy my
2422,BEETHOVEN.[6],"curiosity as to this so-called eccentric genius, I found there"
2423,BEETHOVEN.[6],Beethoven's 'Sonate Pathetique.' This was in the year 1804. My pocket
2424,BEETHOVEN.[6],"money would not suffice for the purchase of it, so I secretly copied it."
2425,BEETHOVEN.[6],"The novelty of its style was so attractive to me, and I became so"
2426,BEETHOVEN.[6],"enthusiastic in my admiration of it, that I forgot myself so far as to"
2427,BEETHOVEN.[6],"mention my new acquisition to my master, who reminded me of his"
2428,BEETHOVEN.[6],"injunction, and warned me not to play or study any eccentric productions"
2429,BEETHOVEN.[6],"until I had based my style upon more solid models. Without, however,"
2430,BEETHOVEN.[6],"minding his injunction, I seized upon the piano-forte works of Beethoven"
2431,BEETHOVEN.[6],"as they successively appeared, and in them found a solace and delight"
2432,BEETHOVEN.[6],such as no other composer afforded me.
2433,BEETHOVEN.[6],
2434,BEETHOVEN.[6],"""In the year 1809, my studies with my master, Weber, closed; and being"
2435,BEETHOVEN.[6],"then also fatherless, I chose Vienna for my residence, to work out my"
2436,BEETHOVEN.[6],"future musical career. Above all, I longed to see and become acquainted"
2437,BEETHOVEN.[6],with that man who had exercised so powerful an influence over my whole
2438,BEETHOVEN.[6],"being; whom, though I scarcely understood, I blindly worshipped. I"
2439,BEETHOVEN.[6],"learned that Beethoven was most difficult of access, and would admit no"
2440,BEETHOVEN.[6],pupil but Ries; and for a long time my anxiety to see him remained
2441,BEETHOVEN.[6],"ungratified. In the year 1810, however, the longed-for opportunity"
2442,BEETHOVEN.[6],presented itself. I happened to be one morning in the music shop of
2443,BEETHOVEN.[6],"Domenico Artaria, who had just been publishing some of my early attempts"
2444,BEETHOVEN.[6],"at composition, when a man entered with short and hasty steps, and"
2445,BEETHOVEN.[6],gliding through the circle of ladies and professors assembled on
2446,BEETHOVEN.[6],"business, or talking over musical matters, without looking up, as though"
2447,BEETHOVEN.[6],"he wished to pass unnoticed, made his way direct for Artaria's private"
2448,BEETHOVEN.[6],"office at the bottom of the shop. Presently Artaria called me in, and"
2449,BEETHOVEN.[6],"said, 'This is Beethoven,'--and to the composer, 'This is the youth of"
2450,BEETHOVEN.[6],"whom I have been speaking to you.' Beethoven gave me a friendly nod, and"
2451,BEETHOVEN.[6],said he had just been hearing a favorable account of me. To some modest
2452,BEETHOVEN.[6],"and humble expressions which I stammered forth he made no reply, and"
2453,BEETHOVEN.[6],seemed to wish to break off the conversation. I stole away with a
2454,BEETHOVEN.[6],"greater longing for that which I had sought, than before this meeting,"
2455,BEETHOVEN.[6],"thinking to myself, 'Am I then, indeed, such a nobody that he could not"
2456,BEETHOVEN.[6],put one musical question to me? nor express one wish to know who had
2457,BEETHOVEN.[6],"been my master, or whether I had any acquaintance with his works?' My"
2458,BEETHOVEN.[6],"only satisfactory mode of explaining the matter, and comforting myself"
2459,BEETHOVEN.[6],"for the omission, was in Beethoven's tendency to deafness; for I had"
2460,BEETHOVEN.[6],seen Artaria speaking close to his ear. But I made up my mind that the
2461,BEETHOVEN.[6],more I was excluded from the private intercourse which I so earnestly
2462,BEETHOVEN.[6],"coveted, the closer I would follow Beethoven in all the productions of"
2463,BEETHOVEN.[6],"his mind."""
2464,BEETHOVEN.[6],
2465,BEETHOVEN.[6],"If Moscheles had never seen more of Beethoven, how rejoiced he would"
2466,BEETHOVEN.[6],"have been on reading his pathetic expressions recorded in those volumes,"
2467,BEETHOVEN.[6],as to the misconstructions he knew his fellow-men must put on conduct
2468,BEETHOVEN.[6],"caused by his calamity, at having detected the true cause of coldness in"
2469,BEETHOVEN.[6],"his own instance, and that no mean suggestions of offended vanity made"
2470,BEETHOVEN.[6],"him false to the genius, because repelled by the man!"
2471,BEETHOVEN.[6],
2472,BEETHOVEN.[6],"Moscheles did see him further, and learned a great deal from this"
2473,BEETHOVEN.[6],"intercourse, though it never became intimate. He closes with these"
2474,BEETHOVEN.[6],excellent remarks:--
2475,BEETHOVEN.[6],
2476,BEETHOVEN.[6],"""My feelings with respect to Beethoven's music have undergone no"
2477,BEETHOVEN.[6],"variation, save to become warmer. In my first half score of years of"
2478,BEETHOVEN.[6],"acquaintance with his works, he was repulsive to me, as well as"
2479,BEETHOVEN.[6],"attractive. In each of them, while I felt my mind fascinated by the"
2480,BEETHOVEN.[6],"prominent idea, and my enthusiasm kindled by the flashes of his genius,"
2481,BEETHOVEN.[6],"his unlooked-for episodes, shrill dissonances, and bold modulations gave"
2482,BEETHOVEN.[6],me an unpleasant sensation. But how soon did I become reconciled to
2483,BEETHOVEN.[6],them! all that had appeared hard I soon found indispensable. The
2484,BEETHOVEN.[6],"gnome-like pleasantries, which at first appeared too distorted, the"
2485,BEETHOVEN.[6],"stormy masses of sound which I found too chaotic, I have in after times"
2486,BEETHOVEN.[6],"learned to love. But while retracting my early critical exceptions, I"
2487,BEETHOVEN.[6],must still maintain as my creed that eccentricities like those of
2488,BEETHOVEN.[6],"Beethoven are reconcilable with his works alone, and are dangerous"
2489,BEETHOVEN.[6],"models to other composers, many of whom have been wrecked in their"
2490,BEETHOVEN.[6],"attempts at imitation."""
2491,BEETHOVEN.[6],
2492,BEETHOVEN.[6],"No doubt the peculiarities of Beethoven are inimitable, though as great"
2493,BEETHOVEN.[6],would be as welcome in a mind of equal greatness. The natural office of
2494,BEETHOVEN.[6],such a genius is to rouse others to a use and knowledge of their own
2495,BEETHOVEN.[6],faculties; never to induce imitation of its own individuality.
2496,BEETHOVEN.[6],
2497,BEETHOVEN.[6],"As an instance of the justice and undoubting clearness of such a mind,"
2498,BEETHOVEN.[6],"as to its own methods, take the following anecdote from Beethoven's"
2499,BEETHOVEN.[6],"""Pupil Ries"":--"
2500,BEETHOVEN.[6],
2501,BEETHOVEN.[6],"""All the initiated must be interested in the striking fact which"
2502,BEETHOVEN.[6],"occurred respecting one of Beethoven's last solo sonatas, (in B major,"
2503,BEETHOVEN.[6],"with the great fugue, Op. 106,) a sonata which has _forty-one pages of"
2504,BEETHOVEN.[6],"print_. Beethoven had sent it to me, to London, for sale, that it might"
2505,BEETHOVEN.[6],appear there at the same time as in Germany. The engraving was
2506,BEETHOVEN.[6],"completed, and I in daily expectation of the letter naming the day of"
2507,BEETHOVEN.[6],"publication. This arrived at last, but with this extraordinary request:"
2508,BEETHOVEN.[6],"'Prefix the following two notes, as a first bar, to the beginning of the"

2510,BEETHOVEN.[6],thought struck me involuntarily that all might not be right with my dear
2511,BEETHOVEN.[6],"old master, a rumor to that effect having often been spread. What! add"
2512,BEETHOVEN.[6],"two notes to a composition already worked out and out, and completed"
2513,BEETHOVEN.[6],months ago? But my astonishment was yet to be heightened by the
2514,BEETHOVEN.[6],_effect_ of these two notes. Never could such be found again--so
2515,BEETHOVEN.[6],"striking--so important; no, not even if contemplated at the very"
2516,BEETHOVEN.[6],beginning of the composition. I would advise every true lover of the art
2517,BEETHOVEN.[6],"to play this adagio first _without_, and then with these two notes which"
2518,BEETHOVEN.[6],"now form the first bar, and I have no doubt he will share in my"
2519,BEETHOVEN.[6],"opinion."""
2520,BEETHOVEN.[6],
2521,BEETHOVEN.[6],"No instance could more forcibly show how in the case of Beethoven, as in"
2522,BEETHOVEN.[6],"that of other transcendent geniuses, the cry of insanity is raised by"
2523,BEETHOVEN.[6],vulgar minds on witnessing extraordinary manifestations of power. Such
2524,BEETHOVEN.[6],"geniuses perceive results so remote, are alive to combinations so"
2525,BEETHOVEN.[6],"subtle, that common men cannot rise high enough to see why they think or"
2526,BEETHOVEN.[6],"do as they do, and settle the matter easily to their own satisfaction,"
2527,BEETHOVEN.[6],"crying, ""He is mad""--""He hath a devil."" Genius perceives the efficacy of"
2528,BEETHOVEN.[6],"slight signs of thought, and loves best the simplest symbols; coarser"
2529,BEETHOVEN.[6],"minds demand coarse work, long preparations, long explanations."
2530,BEETHOVEN.[6],
2531,BEETHOVEN.[6],"But genius heeds them not, but fills the atmosphere with irresistible"
2532,BEETHOVEN.[6],"purity, till they also are pervaded by the delicate influence, which,"
2533,BEETHOVEN.[6],"too subtile for their ears and eyes, enters with the air they breathe,"
2534,BEETHOVEN.[6],or through the pores of the skin.
2535,BEETHOVEN.[6],
2536,BEETHOVEN.[6],The life of a Beethoven is written in his works; and all that can be
2537,BEETHOVEN.[6],"told of his life beside, is but as marginal notes on that broad page."
2538,BEETHOVEN.[6],"Yet since we have these notes, it is pleasant to have them in harmony"
2539,BEETHOVEN.[6],with the page. The acts and words of Beethoven are what we should
2540,BEETHOVEN.[6],"expect,--noble, leonine, impetuous,--yet tender. His faults are the"
2541,BEETHOVEN.[6],faults of one so great that he found few paths wide enough for his
2542,BEETHOVEN.[6],"tread, and knew not how to moderate it. They are not faults in"
2543,BEETHOVEN.[6],"themselves, but only in relation to the men who surrounded him. Among"
2544,BEETHOVEN.[6],"his peers he would not have had faults. As it is, they hardly deserve"
2545,BEETHOVEN.[6],the name. His acts were generally great and benignant; only in
2546,BEETHOVEN.[6],transports of sudden passion at what he thought base did he ever injure
2547,BEETHOVEN.[6],"any one. If he found himself mistaken, he could not humble himself"
2548,BEETHOVEN.[6],"enough,--but far outwent, in his contrition, what was due to those whom"
2549,BEETHOVEN.[6],he had offended. So it is apt to be with magnanimous and tender natures;
2550,BEETHOVEN.[6],they will humble themselves in a way that those of a coarser or colder
2551,BEETHOVEN.[6],make think shows weakness or want of pride. But they do so because a
2552,BEETHOVEN.[6],little discord and a little wrong is as painful to them as a great deal
2553,BEETHOVEN.[6],to others.
2554,BEETHOVEN.[6],
2555,BEETHOVEN.[6],"In one of his letters to a young friend, Beethoven thus magnanimously"
2556,BEETHOVEN.[6],confesses his errors:--
2557,BEETHOVEN.[6],
2558,BEETHOVEN.[6],"""I could not converse with you and yours with that peace of mind which I"
2559,BEETHOVEN.[6],"could have desired, for the late wretched altercation was hovering"
2560,BEETHOVEN.[6],"before me, showing me my own despicable conduct. But so it was; and what"
2561,BEETHOVEN.[6],would I not give could I obliterate from the page of my life this last
2562,BEETHOVEN.[6],"action, so degrading to my character, and so unlike my usual"
2563,BEETHOVEN.[6],"proceedings!"""
2564,BEETHOVEN.[6],
2565,BEETHOVEN.[6],It seems this action of his was not of importance in the eyes of others.
2566,BEETHOVEN.[6],Of the causes which acted upon him at such times he gives intimations in
2567,BEETHOVEN.[6],another letter.
2568,BEETHOVEN.[6],
2569,BEETHOVEN.[6],"""I had been wrought into this burst of passion by many an unpleasant"
2570,BEETHOVEN.[6],circumstance of an earlier date. I have the gift of concealing and
2571,BEETHOVEN.[6],restraining my irritability on many subjects; but if I happen to be
2572,BEETHOVEN.[6],"touched at any time when I am more than usually susceptible of anger, I"
2573,BEETHOVEN.[6],burst forth more violently than any one else. B. has doubtless most
2574,BEETHOVEN.[6],"excellent qualities, but he thinks himself utterly without faults, and"
2575,BEETHOVEN.[6],yet is most open to blame for those for which he censures others. He has
2576,BEETHOVEN.[6],"a littleness of mind which I have held in contempt since my infancy."""

2578,BEETHOVEN.[6],As a correspondent example of the manner in which true greatness
2579,BEETHOVEN.[6],"apologizes for its errors, we must quote a letter, lately made public,"

2581,BEETHOVEN.[6],

2673,BROWN'S NOVELS.[8],"in the higher qualities of the mind, so far in advance of our other"

2675,BROWN'S NOVELS.[8],
2676,BROWN'S NOVELS.[8],It has been the custom to liken Brown to Godwin. But there was no
2677,BROWN'S NOVELS.[8],"imitation, no second hand in the matter. They were congenial natures,"
2678,BROWN'S NOVELS.[8],and whichever had come first might have lent an impulse to the other.
2679,BROWN'S NOVELS.[8],Either mind might have been conscious of the possession of that peculiar
2680,BROWN'S NOVELS.[8],"vein of ore, without thinking of working it for the mint of the world,"
2681,BROWN'S NOVELS.[8],"till the other, led by accident, or overflow of feeling, showed him how"

2686,BROWN'S NOVELS.[8],
2687,BROWN'S NOVELS.[8],Such a man as Brown or Godwin has a right to say that. Their mind is no
2688,BROWN'S NOVELS.[8],"scanty, turbid rill, rejoicing to be daily fed from a thousand others,"
2689,BROWN'S NOVELS.[8],or from the clouds. Its plenteous source rushes from a high mountain
2690,BROWN'S NOVELS.[8],"between bulwarks of stone. Its course, even and full, keeps ever green"

2694,BROWN'S NOVELS.[8],"Life and Joy! Yes, Joy! These two have been called the dark Masters,"

2696,BROWN'S NOVELS.[8],"gravest page in the history of such men is joy, compared with the mixed,"
2697,BROWN'S NOVELS.[8],"shallow, uncertain pleasures of vulgar minds. Joy! because they were all"
2698,BROWN'S NOVELS.[8],"alive, and fulfilled the purposes of being. No sham, no imitation, no"
2699,BROWN'S NOVELS.[8],"convention deformed or veiled their native lineaments, or checked the"

2826,EDGAR A. POE.[9],"painfully winnowed the wheat,--with the chaff for his pains. We joined"
2827,EDGAR A. POE.[9],"the gentle Affirmative School, and have confidence that if we indulge"
2828,EDGAR A. POE.[9],"ourselves chiefly with the appreciation of good qualities, Time will"
2829,EDGAR A. POE.[9],take care of the faults. For Time holds a strainer like that used in the

2831,EDGAR A. POE.[9],"through, and only the precious stones be left. Yet we are not blind to"

2841,EDGAR A. POE.[9],"correspondence, of Miss Hannah More, is fully represented in our day and"

2843,EDGAR A. POE.[9],"Truth-tellers, few, but each of them mighty as Fingal or any other hero"
2844,EDGAR A. POE.[9],"of the sort. Let such tell the whole truth, as well as nothing but the"
2845,EDGAR A. POE.[9],"truth, but let their sternness be in the spirit of Love. Let them seek"
2846,EDGAR A. POE.[9],"to understand the purpose and scope of an author, his capacity as well"
2847,EDGAR A. POE.[9],"as his fulfilments, and how his faults are made to grow by the same"
2848,EDGAR A. POE.[9],"sunshine that acts upon his virtues, for this is the case with talents"
2849,EDGAR A. POE.[9],no less than with character. The rich field requires frequent and

2853,EDGAR A. POE.[9],It has often been our lot to share the mistake of Gil Blas with regard
2854,EDGAR A. POE.[9],"to the Archbishop. We have taken people at their word, and while"

2858,EDGAR A. POE.[9],"rudely awakened from our dream, and found that chanticleer, who crowed"
2859,EDGAR A. POE.[9],"so bravely, showed himself at last but a dunghill fowl. Yet Heaven grant"
2860,EDGAR A. POE.[9],"we never become too worldly-wise thus to trust a generous word, and we"

2872,EDGAR A. POE.[9],"unless in hearty earnest. If in earnest, they are honorable pledges; if"
2873,EDGAR A. POE.[9],"not, a pitiful fence and foil of vanity. Earnest or not, the words are"
2874,EDGAR A. POE.[9],thus far true; the productions in this volume indicate a power to do
2875,EDGAR A. POE.[9],"something far better. With the exception of the Raven, which seems"
2876,EDGAR A. POE.[9],"intended chiefly to show the writer's artistic skill, and is in its way"
2877,EDGAR A. POE.[9],"a rare and finished specimen, they are all fragments--_fyttes_ upon the"

2996,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"Should that star be forsaken by its angel, and those hopes set finally"
2997,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"in clouds of shame, the church which we had built out of the ruins of"
2998,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],the ancient time must fall to the ground. This church seemed a model of
2999,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"divine art. It contained a labyrinth which, when threaded by aid of the"
3000,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"clew of Faith, presented, re-viewed from its centre, the most admirable"
3001,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"harmony and depth of meaning in its design, and comprised in its"
3002,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],decorations all the symbols of permanent interest of which the mind of
3003,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"man has made use for the benefit of man. Such was to be our church, a"
3004,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"church not made with hands, catholic, universal, all whose stones should"
3005,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"be living stones, its officials the cherubim of Love and Knowledge, its"

3014,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"would still be in the world, and surely guide each bird, that can be"
3015,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"patient, on the wing to its home at last. But expectations so noble,"
3016,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"which find so broad a basis in the past, which link it so harmoniously"
3017,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"with the future, cannot lightly be abandoned. The same Power leads by a"
3018,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],pillar of cloud as by a pillar of fire--the Power that deemed even Moses
3019,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],worthy only of a distant view of the Promised Land.
3020,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],
3021,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"And to those who cherish such expectations rational education,"
3022,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"considered in various ways and bearings, must be the one great topic of"
3023,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],interest; an enterprise in which the humblest service is precious and
3024,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],honorable to any who can inspire its soul. Our thoughts anticipate with
3025,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],eager foresight the race that may grow up from this amalgamation of all
3026,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],races of the world which our situation induces. It was the pride and
3027,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],greatness of ancient nations to keep their blood unmixed; but it must be
3028,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"ours to be willing to mingle, to accept in a generous spirit what each"
3029,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],clime and race has to offer us.
3030,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],
3031,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"It is, indeed, the case that much diseased substance is offered to form"

3034,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"a very high form of organic life, they must needs induce one distorted,"
3035,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"corrupt, and degraded beyond the example of other times and places."
3036,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],There will be no medium about it. Our grand scene of action demands
3037,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"grandeur and purity; lacking these, one must suffer from so base failure"
3038,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],in proportion to the success that should have been.
3039,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],
3040,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],It would be the worthiest occupation of mind to ascertain the
3041,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"conditions propitious for this meeting of the nations in their new home,"
3042,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],and to provide preventions for obvious dangers that attend it. It would
3043,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],be occupation for which the broadest and deepest knowledge of human
3044,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"nature in its mental, moral, and bodily relations, the noblest freedom"
3045,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"from prejudice, with the finest discrimination as to differences and"
3046,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"relations, directed and enlightened by a prophetic sense as to what Man"
3047,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"is designed by God to become, would all be needed to fit the thinker."
3048,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"Yet some portion of these qualities, or of some of these qualities, if"
3049,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"accompanied by earnestness and aspiration, may enable any one to offer"
3050,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"useful suggestions. The mass of ignorance and selfishness is such, that"
3051,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],no grain of leaven must be despised.
3052,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],
3053,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"And as the men of all countries come hither to find a home, and become"
3054,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"parts of a new life, so do the books of all countries gravitate towards"
3055,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],this new centre. Copious infusions from all quarters mingle daily with
3056,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"the new thought which is to grow into American mind, and develop"
3057,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],American literature.
3058,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],
3059,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"As every ship brings us foreign teachers, a knowledge of living"
3060,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],contemporary tongues must in the course of fifty years become the
3061,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],commonest attainment. There exists no doubt in the minds of those who
3062,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"can judge, that the German, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese"
3063,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"tongues might, by familiar instruction and _an intelligent method_, be"
3064,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"taught with perfect ease during the years of childhood, so that the"
3065,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"child would have as distinct a sense of their several natures, and"
3066,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"nearly as much expertness in their use, as in his own. The higher uses"
3067,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"of such knowledge can, of course, be expected only in a more advanced"
3068,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],state of the faculties; but it is pity that the acquaintance with the
3069,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],medium of thought should be deferred to a period when the mind is
3070,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],sufficiently grown to bend its chief attention on the thoughts
3071,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],themselves. Much of the most precious part of short human lives is now
3072,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"wasted from an ignorance of what might easily be done for children, and"
3073,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"without taking from them the time they need for common life, play, and"
3074,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"bodily growth, more than at present."
3075,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],
3076,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],Meanwhile the English begins to vie with the German and French
3077,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"literature in the number, though not in the goodness, of the"
3078,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],translations from other languages. The indefatigable Germans can
3079,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"translate, and do other things too; so that geniuses often there apply"
3080,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],themselves to the work as an amusement: even the all-employed Goethe
3081,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"has translated one of the books before us, (Memoirs of Cellini.) But in"
3082,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"English we know but of one, Coleridge's Wallenstein, where the reader"
3083,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],will feel the electric current undiminished by the medium through which
3084,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],it comes to him. And then the profligate abuse of the power of
3085,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"translation has been unparalleled, whether in the choice of books or the"
3086,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],carelessness in disguising those that were good in a hideous mask. No
3087,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],falsehood can be worse than this of deforming the expression of a great
3088,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"man's thoughts, of corrupting that form which he has watched, and toiled"
3089,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],and suffered to make beautiful and true. We know no falsehood that
3090,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],should call a more painful blush to the cheek of one engaged in it.
3091,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],
3092,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],We have no narrowness in our view of the contents of such books. We are
3093,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"not afraid of new standards and new examples. Only give enough of them,"
3094,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"variety enough, and from well-intentioned, generous minds. America can"
3095,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"choose what she wants, if she has sufficient range of choice; and if"
3096,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"there is any real reason, any deep root in the tastes and opinions she"
3097,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"holds at present, she will not lightly yield them. Only give her what is"
3098,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"good of its kind. Her hope is not in ignorance, but in knowledge. We"
3099,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"are, indeed, very fond of range, and if there is check, there should be"
3100,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],countercheck; and in this view we are delighted to see these great
3101,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],Italians domesticated here. We have had somewhat too much of the French
3102,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],and Germans of late. We value unchangeably our sparkling and rapid
3103,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"French friend; still more the searching, honest, and, in highest sense,"
3104,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"visionary German genius. But there is not on earth, and, we dare to say"
3105,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"it, will not be again, genius _like_ that of Italy, or that can compare"
3106,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"with it, in its own way."
3107,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],
3108,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],Italy and Greece were alike in this; those sunny skies ripened their
3109,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"fruits perfectly. The oil and honey of Greece, the wine of Italy, not"
3110,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"only suggest, but satisfy. _There_ we find fulfilment, elsewhere great"
3111,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],achievement only.
3112,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],
3113,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"O, acute, cautious, calculating Yankee; O, graceful, witty, hot-blooded,"
3114,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"flimsy Southron; and thou, man of the West, going ahead too fast to pick"
3115,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"up a thought or leave a flower upon thy path,--look at these men with"
3116,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"their great fiery passions, but will and intellect still greater and"
3117,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"stronger, perfectly sincere, from a contempt of falsehood. If they had"
3118,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"acted wrong, they said and felt that they had, and that it was base and"
3119,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"hateful in them. They were sagacious, as children are, not from"
3120,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"calculation, but because the fine instincts of nature were unspoiled in"
3121,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],them. I speak now of Alfieri and Cellini. Dante had all their
3122,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"instinctive greatness and deep-seated fire, with the reflective and"
3123,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"creative faculties besides, to an extent of which they never dreamed."
3124,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],
3125,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],He who reads these biographies may take them from several points of
3126,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"view. As pictures of manners, as sincere transcripts of the men and"
3127,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"their times, they are not and could not be surpassed. That truth which"
3128,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"Rousseau sought so painfully and vainly by self-brooding, subtle"
3129,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"analysis, they attained without an effort. _Why_ they felt they cared"
3130,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"little, but _what_ they felt they surely knew; and where a fly or worm"
3131,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"has injured the peach, its passage is exactly marked, so that you are"
3132,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],sure the rest is fair and sound. Both as physiological and psychical
3133,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"histories, they are full of instruction. In Alfieri, especially, the"
3134,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],nervous disease generated in the frame by any uncongenial tension of the
3135,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"brain, the periodical crises in his health, the manner in which his"
3136,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"accesses of passion came upon him, afford infinite suggestion to one who"
3137,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],has an eye for the circumstances which fashion the destiny of man. Let
3138,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],the physician compare the furies of Alfieri with the silent rages of
3139,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"Byron, and give the mother and pedagogue the light in which they are now"
3140,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"wholly wanting, showing how to treat such noble plants in the early"
3141,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"stages of growth. We think the ""hated cap"" would not be put a second"
3142,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],time on the head so easily diseased.
3143,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],
3144,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"The biography of Cellini, it is commonly said, is more interesting than"
3145,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"any romance. It _is_ a romance, with the character of the hero fully"
3146,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"brought out. Cellini lived in all the fulness of inward vigor, all the"
3147,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"variety of outward adventure, and passed through all the signs of the"
3148,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"Zodiac, in his circling course, occasionally raising a little vapor from"
3149,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"the art magic. He was really the Orlando Furioso turned Goldsmith, and"
3150,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"Angelicas and all the Peers of France joined in the show. However, he"
3151,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],never lived deeply; he had not time; the creative energy turned outward
3152,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"too easily, and took those forms that still enchant the mind of Europe."
3153,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],Alfieri was very different in this. He was like the root of some
3154,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"splendid southern plant, buried beneath a heap of rubbish. Above him was"
3155,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"a glorious sky, fit to develop his form and excite his colors; but he"
3156,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],was compelled to a long and terrible struggle to get up where he could
3157,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"be free to receive its influence. Institutions, language, family, modes"
3158,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"of education,--all were unfit for him; and perhaps no man was ever"
3159,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"called to such efforts, after he had reached manly age, to unmake and"
3160,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],remake himself before he could become what his inward aspiration craved.
3161,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"All this deepened his nature, and it _was_ deep. It is his great force"
3162,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"of will and the compression of Nature within its iron grasp, where"
3163,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"Nature was so powerful and impulsive, that constitutes the charm of his"
3164,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"writings. It is the man Alfieri who moves, nay, overpowers us, and not"
3165,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"his writings, which have no flow nor plastic beauty. But we feel the"
3166,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"vital dynamics, and imagine it all."
3167,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],
3168,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"By us Americans, if ever such we really are to be, Alfieri should be"
3169,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],held sacred as a godfather and holy light. He was a harbinger of what
3170,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],most gives this time its character and value. He was the friend of
3171,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"liberty, the friend of man, in the sense that Burns was--of the native"
3172,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"nobleness of man. Soiled and degraded men he hated. He was, indeed, a"
3173,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"man of pitiless hatred as of boundless love, and he had bitter"
3174,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"prejudices too, but they were from antipathies too strongly intertwined"
3175,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],with his sympathies for any hand less powerful than that of Death to
3176,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],rend them away.
3177,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],
3178,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],But our space does not permit us to do any justice to such a life as
3179,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"Alfieri's. Let others read it, not from their habitual, but an eternal"
3180,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"point of view, and they cannot mistake its purport. Some will be most"
3181,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"touched by the storms of his youth, others by the exploits and conquests"
3182,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"of his later years; but all will find him, in the words of his friend"
3183,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"Casella, ""sculptured just as he was, lofty, strange, and extreme, not"
3184,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"only in his natural characteristics, but in every work that did not seem"
3185,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"to him unworthy of his generous affections. And where he went too far,"
3186,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],it is easy to perceive his excesses always flowed from some praiseworthy
3187,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"sentiment."""
3188,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],
3189,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],Among a crowd of thoughts suggested to the mind by reperusal of this
3190,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"book, to us a friend of many years standing, we hastily note the"
3191,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],following:--
3192,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],
3193,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"Alfieri knew how to be a friend, and had friends such as his masculine"
3194,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],and uncompromising temper fitted him to endure and keep. He had even two
3195,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],or three of those noble friends. He was a perfect lover in delicacy of
3196,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"sentiment, in devotion, in a desire for constancy, in a high ideal,"
3197,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"growing always higher, and he was, at last, happy in love. Many geniuses"
3198,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"have spoken worthily of women in their works, but he speaks of woman as"
3199,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"she wishes to be spoken of, and declares that he met the desire of his"
3200,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"soul realized in life. This, almost alone, is an instance where a great"
3201,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"nature was permanently satisfied, and the claims of man and woman"
3202,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"equally met, where one of the parties had the impatient fire of genius."
3203,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"His testimony on this subject is of so rare a sort, we must copy it:--"
3204,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],
3205,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"""My fourth and last passion, fortunately for me, showed itself by"
3206,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"symptoms entirely different from the three first. In the former, my"
3207,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],intellect had felt little of the fires of passion; but now my heart and
3208,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"my genius were both equally kindled, and if my passion was less"
3209,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"impetuous, it became more profound and lasting. Such was the flame which"
3210,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"by degrees absorbed every affection and thought of my being, and it will"
3211,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],never fade away except with my life. Two months satisfied me that I had
3212,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"now found the _true woman_; for, instead of encountering in her, as in"
3213,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"all common women, an obstacle to literary glory, a hinderance to useful"
3214,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"occupations, and a damper to thought, she proved a high stimulus, a pure"
3215,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"solace, and an alluring example to every beautiful work. Prizing a"
3216,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"treasure so rare, I gave myself away to her irrevocably. And I certainly"
3217,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"erred not. More than twelve years have passed, and while I am writing"
3218,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"this chit-chat, having reached that calm season when passion loses its"
3219,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"blandishments, I cherish her more tenderly than ever; and I love her"
3220,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],just in proportion as glide from her in the lapse of time those
3221,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],little-esteemed toll-gatherers of departing beauty. In her my soul is
3222,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"exalted, softened, and made better day by day; and I will dare to say"
3223,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"and believe she has found in me support and consolation."""
3224,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],
3225,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],We have spoken of the peculiarities in Alfieri's physical condition.
3226,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],These naturally led him to seek solace in violent exercise; and as in
3227,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"the case of Beckford and Byron, horses were his best friends in the hour"
3228,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"of danger. This sort of man is the modern Achilles, ""the tamer of"
3229,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"horses."" In what degree the health of Alfieri was improved, and his"
3230,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"sympathies awakened by the society and care of these noble animals, is"
3231,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"very evident. Almost all persons, perhaps all that are in a natural"
3232,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"state, need to stand in patriarchal relations with the animals most"
3233,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],correspondent with their character. We have the highest respect for this
3234,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"instinct and sincere belief in the good it brings; if understood, it"
3235,ALFIERI AND CELLINI.[10],"would be cherished, not ridiculed."

3241,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,
3242,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,
3243,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,Translating Dante is indeed a labor of love. It is one in which even a
3244,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,moderate degree of success is impossible. No great Poet can be well
3245,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,translated. The form of his thought is inseparable from his thought. The
3246,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,births of his genius are perfect beings: body and soul are in such
3247,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,perfect harmony that you cannot at all alter the one without veiling the
3248,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"other. The variation in cadence and modulation, even where the words are"
3249,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"exactly rendered, takes not only from the form of the thought, but from"
3250,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"the thought itself, its most delicate charm. Translations come to us as"
3251,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,a message to the lover from the lady of his love through the lips of a
3252,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,confidante or menial--we are obliged to imagine what was most vital in
3253,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,the utterance.
3254,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,
3255,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"These difficulties, always insuperable, are accumulated a hundred-fold"
3256,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"in the case of Dante, both by the extraordinary depth and subtlety of"
3257,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"his thought, and his no less extraordinary power of concentrating its"
3258,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"expression, till every verse is like a blade of thoroughly tempered"
3259,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,steel. You might as well attempt to translate a glance of fire from the
3260,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,human eye into any other language--even music cannot do that.
3261,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,
3262,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"We think, then, that the use of Cary's translation, or any other, can"
3263,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,never be to diffuse a knowledge of Dante. This is not in its nature
3264,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,diffusible; he is one of those to whom others must draw near; he cannot
3265,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,be brought to them. He has no superficial charm to cheat the reader into
3266,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"a belief that he knows him, without entrance into the same sphere."
3267,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,
3268,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"These translations can be of use only to the translators, as a means of"

3273,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,
3274,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,We must say a few words as to the pedantic folly with which this study
3275,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"has been prosecuted in this country, and, we believe, in England. Not"
3276,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"only the tragedies of Alfieri and the Faust of Goethe, but the Divina"
3277,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"Commedia of Dante,--a work which it is not probable there are upon"
3278,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"earth, at any one time, a hundred minds able to appreciate,--are turned"
3279,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,into school books for little girls who have just left their hoops and
3280,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"dolls, and boys whose highest ambition it is to ride a horse that will"
3281,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"run away, and brave the tutor in a college frolic."
3282,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,
3283,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"This is done from the idea that, in order to get acquainted with a"
3284,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"foreign language, the student must read books that have attained the"
3285,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"dignity of classics, and also which are ""hard."" Hard indeed it must be"
3286,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,for the Muses to see their lyres turned into gridirons for the
3287,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,preparation of a school-girl's lunch; harder still for the younglings to

3294,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,wrote in the Latin tongue equally fit for the appreciation of sixteen
3295,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"Yankee years? In Italian, have you not Tasso, Ariosto, and other writers"
3296,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"who have really a great deal that the immature mind can enjoy, without"

3300,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"leave these great authors, fancying, to their life-long misfortune, that"
3301,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"they have read them. I have been reminded, by the remarks of my young"

3311,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"to a library, for his countrymen have not been less external and"
3312,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,benighted in their way of regarding him. Painfully they study through
3313,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"the book, seeking with anxious attention to know who Signor This is, and"
3314,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"who was the cousin of Signora That, and whether any deep papal or"
3315,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,anti-papal meaning was couched by Dante under the remark that Such-a-one
3316,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"wore a great-coat. A mind, whose small chambers look yet smaller by"
3317,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"being crowded with furniture from all parts of the world, bought by"
3318,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"labor, not received from inheritance or won by love, asserts that he"
3319,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"must understand Dante well, better than any other person probably,"
3320,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,because he has studied him through in this way thirty or forty times. As
3321,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,well declare you have a better appreciation of Shakspeare than any one
3322,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"else because you have identified the birthplace of Dame Quickly, or"
3323,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,ascertained the churchyard where the ghost of the royal Dane hid from
3324,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"the sight of that far more celestial spirit, his son."
3325,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,
3326,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"O, painstaking friends! Shut your books, clear your minds from"
3327,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"artificial nonsense, and feel that only by spirit can spirit be"
3328,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"discerned. Dante, like each other great one, took the stuff that lay"
3329,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"around him, and wove it into a garment of light. It is not by ravelling"
3330,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,that you will best appreciate its tissue or design. It is not by
3331,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"studying out the petty strifes or external relations of his time, that"
3332,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,you can become acquainted with the thought of Dante. To him these things
3333,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,were only soil in which to plant himself--figures by which to dramatize
3334,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"and evolve his ideas. Would you learn him, go listen in the forest of"
3335,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,human passions to all the terrible voices he heard with a tormented but
3336,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"never-to-be-deafened ear; go down into the hells, where each excess that"
3337,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,mars the harmony of nature is punished by the sinner finding no food
3338,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,except from his own harvest; pass through the purgatories of
3339,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"speculation, of struggling hope, and faith, never quite quenched, but"
3340,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"smouldering often and long beneath the ashes. Soar if thou canst, but if"
3341,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"thou canst not, clear thine eye to see this great eagle soar into the"
3342,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,higher region where forms arrange themselves for stellar dance and
3343,ITALY.--CARY'S DANTE.,"spheral melody,--and thought, with costly-accelerated motion, raises"

3568,NAPOLEON AND HIS MARSHALS.[12],of the great Frederic of Prussia. He never did any thing so meanly
3569,NAPOLEON AND HIS MARSHALS.[12],wicked as has just been done in stirring up the Polish peasants to
3570,NAPOLEON AND HIS MARSHALS.[12],assassinate the nobles. He never did any thing so atrocious as has been

3603,NAPOLEON AND HIS MARSHALS.[12],a part of the same thought of which he was the most forcible
3604,NAPOLEON AND HIS MARSHALS.[12],"expression. If sometimes inclined to disparage them, it was as a man"
3605,NAPOLEON AND HIS MARSHALS.[12],might disparage his hand by saying it was not his head. He truly felt
3606,NAPOLEON AND HIS MARSHALS.[12],"that he was the central force, though some of them were greater in the"

3609,NAPOLEON AND HIS MARSHALS.[12],disgraceful enough from a foe whom they so long held in terror. But to

3662,PHYSICAL EDUCATION.[13],"country, where the most barbarous ignorance prevails on the subject of"
3663,PHYSICAL EDUCATION.[13],"cleanliness, sleeping accommodations, &c.! On these subjects improvement"
3664,PHYSICAL EDUCATION.[13],"would be easy; that of diet is far more complicated, and is,"

3666,PHYSICAL EDUCATION.[13],the human frame is affected by the changes of climate and various other
3667,PHYSICAL EDUCATION.[13],"influences, even wisely to discuss. If it is difficult where a race,"
3668,PHYSICAL EDUCATION.[13],"mostly indigenous to the soil, feed upon what Mother Nature has prepared"
3669,PHYSICAL EDUCATION.[13],"expressly for their use, and where excess or want of judgment in its use"
3670,PHYSICAL EDUCATION.[13],"produces disease, it must be far more so where men come from all"
3671,PHYSICAL EDUCATION.[13],"latitudes to live under new circumstances, and need a judicious"
3672,PHYSICAL EDUCATION.[13],adaptation of the old to the new. The dogmatism and proscription that

3714,PHYSICAL EDUCATION.[13],"""The manner in which children sleep will readily be acknowledged to be"
3715,PHYSICAL EDUCATION.[13],important; yet very little attention is paid to this matter. Children
3716,PHYSICAL EDUCATION.[13],"are crowded together in small, unventilated rooms, often two or three in"
3717,PHYSICAL EDUCATION.[13],"a bed, and on beds composed of half prepared feathers, from which issues"
3718,PHYSICAL EDUCATION.[13],"a noxious effluvia, infecting the child at a period when he is least"

3724,PHYSICAL EDUCATION.[13],"having a fireplace, which should be kept open the greater part of the"
3725,PHYSICAL EDUCATION.[13],year. There never should be more than one in the same bed; and this
3726,PHYSICAL EDUCATION.[13],remark may be applied with equal propriety to adults. The substance on
3727,PHYSICAL EDUCATION.[13],"which they lie should be hair, thoroughly prepared, so that it should"

3734,PHYSICAL EDUCATION.[13],universally. The use of double beds has been very generally adopted in
3735,PHYSICAL EDUCATION.[13],"this country, perhaps in part as a matter of economy; but this practice"
3736,PHYSICAL EDUCATION.[13],"is objectionable, for more reasons than can be stated here."""

3739,PHYSICAL EDUCATION.[13],"we copy what he says, because of the perfect ease and convenience with"

3747,PHYSICAL EDUCATION.[13],"the muscles of the chest, and, indeed, when adroitly employed, those of"

3795,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],
3796,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],Frederick Douglass has been for some time a prominent member of the
3797,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],abolition party. He is said to be an excellent speaker--can speak from a
3798,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"thorough personal experience--and has upon the audience, besides, the"
3799,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],influence of a strong character and uncommon talents. In the book before
3800,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"us he has put into the story of his life the thoughts, the feelings, and"
3801,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],the adventures that have been so affecting through the living voice; nor
3802,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],are they less so from the printed page. He has had the courage to name
3803,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"persons, times, and places, thus exposing himself to obvious danger, and"
3804,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],setting the seal on his deep convictions as to the religious need of
3805,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"speaking the whole truth. Considered merely as a narrative, we have"
3806,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"never read one more simple, true, coherent, and warm with genuine"
3807,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"feeling. It is an excellent piece of writing, and on that score to be"
3808,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"prized as a specimen of the powers of the black race, which prejudice"
3809,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"persists in disputing. We prize highly all evidence of this kind, and it"
3810,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],is becoming more abundant. The cross of the Legion of Honor has just
3811,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"been conferred in France on Dumas and Souliè, both celebrated in the"
3812,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"paths of light literature. Dumas, whose father was a general in the"
3813,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"French army, is a mulatto; Souliè, a quadroon. He went from New Orleans,"
3814,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"where, though to the eye a white man, yet, as known to have African"
3815,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"blood in his veins, he could never have enjoyed the privileges due to a"
3816,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"human being. Leaving the land of freedom, he found himself free to"
3817,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],develop the powers that God had given.
3818,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],
3819,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"Two wise and candid thinkers--the Scotchman Kinmont, prematurely lost to"
3820,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"this country, of which he was so faithful and generous a student, and"
3821,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"the late Dr. Channing,--both thought that the African race had in them a"
3822,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"peculiar element, which, if it could be assimilated with those imported"
3823,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"among us from Europe, would give to genius a development, and to the"
3824,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"energies of character a balance and harmony, beyond what has been seen"
3825,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],heretofore in the history of the world. Such an element is indicated in
3826,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"their lowest estate by a talent for melody, a ready skill at imitation"
3827,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"and adaptation, an almost indestructible elasticity of nature. It is to"
3828,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"be remarked in the writings both of Souliè and Dumas, full of faults,"
3829,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],but glowing with plastic life and fertile in invention. The same torrid
3830,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],energy and saccharine fulness may be felt in the writings of this
3831,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"Douglass, though his life, being one of action or resistance, has been"
3832,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],less favorable to _such_ powers than one of a more joyous flow might
3833,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],have been.
3834,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],
3835,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"The book is prefaced by two communications--one from Garrison, and one"
3836,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],from Wendell Phillips. That from the former is in his usual
3837,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],over-emphatic style. His motives and his course have been noble and
3838,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],generous; we look upon him with high respect; but he has indulged in
3839,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],violent invective and denunciation till he has spoiled the temper of his
3840,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],mind. Like a man who has been in the habit of screaming himself hoarse
3841,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"to make the deaf hear, he can no longer pitch his voice on a key"
3842,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"agreeable to common ears. Mr. Phillips's remarks are equally decided,"
3843,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],without this exaggeration in the tone. Douglass himself seems very just
3844,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"and temperate. We feel that his view, even of those who have injured him"
3845,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"most, may be relied upon. He knows how to allow for motives and"
3846,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"influences. Upon the subject of religion, he speaks with great force,"
3847,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],and not more than our own sympathies can respond to. The inconsistencies
3848,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],of slaveholding professors of religion cry to Heaven. We are not
3849,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"disposed to detest, or refuse communion with them. Their blindness is"
3850,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],but one form of that prevalent fallacy which substitutes a creed for a
3851,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"faith, a ritual for a life. We have seen too much of this system of"
3852,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],atonement not to know that those who adopt it often began with good
3853,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"intentions, and are, at any rate, in their mistakes worthy of the"
3854,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"deepest pity. But that is no reason why the truth should not be uttered,"
3855,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"trumpet-tongued, about the thing. ""Bring no more vain oblations;"""
3856,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"sermons must daily be preached anew on that text. Kings, five hundred"
3857,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"years ago, built churches with the spoils of war; clergymen to-day"
3858,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"command slaves to obey a gospel which they will not allow them to read,"
3859,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],and call themselves Christians amid the curses of their fellow-men. The
3860,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"world ought to get on a little faster than this, if there be really any"
3861,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],principle of improvement in it. The kingdom of heaven may not at the
3862,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"beginning have dropped seed larger than a mustard-seed, but even from"
3863,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],that we had a right to expect a fuller growth than we can believe to
3864,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"exist, when we read such a book as this of Douglass. Unspeakably"
3865,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],affecting is the fact that he never saw his mother at all by daylight.
3866,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],
3867,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"""I do not recollect of ever seeing my mother by the light of day. She"
3868,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"was with me in the night. She would lie down with me, and get me to"
3869,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"sleep, but long before I waked she was gone."""

3871,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],The following extract presents a suitable answer to the hackneyed
3872,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"argument drawn by the defender of slavery from the songs of the slave,"
3873,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],and is also a good specimen of the powers of observation and manly heart
3874,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"of the writer. We wish that every one may read his book, and see what a"
3875,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],mind might have been stifled in bondage--what a man may be subjected to
3876,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"the insults of spendthrift dandies, or the blows of mercenary brutes, in"
3877,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"whom there is no whiteness except of the skin, no humanity except in the"

3881,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"""The Home Plantation of Colonel Lloyd wore the appeaance of a country"
3882,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],village. All the mechanical operations for all the farms were performed
3883,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"here. The shoemaking and mending, the blacksmithing, cartwrighting,"
3884,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"coopering, weaving, and grain-grinding, were all performed by the slaves"
3885,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],on the Home Plantation. The whole place wore a business-like aspect very
3886,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"unlike the neighboring farms. The number of houses, too, conspired to"
3887,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],give it advantage over the neighboring farms. It was called by the
3888,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"slaves the _Great House Farm_. Few privileges were esteemed higher, by"
3889,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"the slaves of the out-farms, than that of being selected to do errands"
3890,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],at the Great House Farm. It was associated in their minds with
3891,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],greatness. A representative could not be prouder of his election to a
3892,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"seat in the American Congress, than a slave on one of the out-farms"
3893,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],would be of his election to do errands at the Great House Farm. They
3894,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],regarded it as evidence of great confidence reposed in them by their
3895,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"overseers; and it was on this account, as well as a constant desire to"
3896,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"be out of the field, from under the driver's lash, that they esteemed it"
3897,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"a high privilege, one worth careful living for. He was called the"
3898,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],smartest and most trusty fellow who had this honor conferred upon him
3899,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],the most frequently. The competitors for this office sought as
3900,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],diligently to please their overseers as the office-seekers in the
3901,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],political parties seek to please and deceive the people. The same traits
3902,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"of character might be seen in Colonel Lloyd's slaves, as are seen in the"
3903,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],slaves of the political parties.
3904,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],
3905,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"""The slaves selected to go to the Great House Farm, for the monthly"
3906,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"allowance for themselves and their fellow-slaves, were peculiarly"
3907,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"enthusiastic. While on their way, they would make the dense old woods,"
3908,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"for miles around, reverberate with their wild songs, revealing at once"
3909,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],the highest joy and the deepest sadness. They would compose and sing as
3910,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"they went along, consulting neither time nor tune. The thought that came"
3911,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"up came out,--if not in the word, in the sound,--and as frequently in"
3912,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],the one as in the other. They would sometimes sing the most pathetic
3913,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"sentiment in the most rapturous tone, and the most rapturous sentiment"
3914,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],in the most pathetic tone. Into all their songs they would manage to
3915,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],weave something of the Great House Farm. Especially would they do this
3916,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],when leaving home. They would then sing most exultingly the following
3917,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],words:--

3920,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"O, yea! O, yea! O!'"
3921,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],
3922,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],This they would sing as a chorus to words which to many would seem
3923,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"unmeaning jargon, but which, nevertheless, were full of meaning to"
3924,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],themselves. I have sometimes thought that the mere hearing of those
3925,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],songs would do more to impress some minds with the horrible character of
3926,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"slavery, than the reading of whole volumes of philosophy on the subject"
3927,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],could do.
3928,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],
3929,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"""I did not, when a slave, understand the deep meaning of those rude and"
3930,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],apparently incoherent songs. I was myself within the circle; so that I
3931,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],neither saw nor heard as those without might see and hear. They told a
3932,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],tale of woe which was then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension;
3933,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"they were tones loud, long, and deep; they breathed the prayer and"
3934,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],complaint of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish. Every tone
3935,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"was a testimony against slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance"
3936,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"from chains. The hearing of those wild notes always depressed my spirit,"
3937,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],and filled me with ineffable sadness. I have frequently found myself in
3938,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"tears while hearing them. The mere recurrence to those songs, even now,"
3939,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"afflicts me; and while I am writing these lines, an expression of"
3940,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],feeling has already found its way down my cheek. To those songs I trace
3941,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],my first glimmering conception of the dehumanizing character of slavery.
3942,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"I can never get rid of that conception. Those songs still follow me, to"
3943,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"deepen my hatred of slavery, and quicken my sympathies for my brethren"
3944,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],in bonds. If any one wishes to be impressed with the soul-killing
3945,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"effects of slavery, let him go to Colonel Lloyd's plantation, and, on"
3946,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"allowance day, place himself in the deep pine woods, and there let him,"
3947,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"in silence, analyze the sounds that shall pass through the chambers of"
3948,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"his soul; and if he is not thus impressed, it will only be because"
3949,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],'there is no flesh in his obdurate heart.'
3950,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],
3951,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"""I have often been utterly astonished, since I came to the north, to"
3952,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],find persons who could speak of the singing among slaves as evidence of
3953,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],their contentment and happiness. It is impossible to conceive of a
3954,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],greater mistake. Slaves sing most when they are most unhappy. The songs
3955,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],of the slave represent the sorrows of his heart; and he is relieved by
3956,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"them only as an aching heart is relieved by its tears. At least, such is"
3957,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"my experience. I have often sung to drown my sorrow, but seldom to"
3958,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],express my happiness. Crying for joy and singing for joy were alike
3959,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],uncommon to me while in the jaws of slavery. The singing of a man cast
3960,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],away upon a desolate island might be as appropriately considered as
3961,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"evidence of contentment and happiness, as the singing of a slave; the"
3962,FREDERICK DOUGLASS.[15],"songs of the one and of the other are prompted by the same emotion."""

3984,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],The natural process of the mind in forming a judgment is comparison. The
3985,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],office of sound criticism is to teach that this comparison should be
3986,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"made, not between the productions of differently-constituted minds, but"
3987,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],between any one of these and a fixed standard of perfection.
3988,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],Nevertheless it is not contrary to the canon to take a survey of the
3989,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"labors of many artists with reference to one, if we value them, not"
3990,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"according to the degree of pleasure we have experienced from them, which"
3991,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"must always depend upon our then age, the state of the passions and"
3992,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"relations with life, but according to the success of the artist in"
3993,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],attaining the object he himself had in view. To illustrate: In the same
3994,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"room hang two pictures, Raphael's Madonna and Martin's Destruction of"
3995,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Nineveh. A person enters, capable of admiring both, but young,"
3996,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"excitable; he is delighted with the Madonna, but probably far more so"
3997,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"with the other, because his imagination is at that time more developed"
3998,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],than the pure love for beauty which is the characteristic of a taste in
3999,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"a higher state of cultivation. He prefers the Martin, because it excites"
4000,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"in his mind a thousand images of sublimity and terror, recalls the"
4001,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"brilliancy of Oriental history, and the stern pomp of the old prophetic"
4002,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"day, and rouses his mind to a high state of action, _then_ as congenial"
4003,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],with its wants as at a later day would be the feeling of contented
4004,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"absorption, of perfect satisfaction with a production of the human soul,"
4005,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],which one of Raphael's calmly beautiful creations is fitted to cause.
4006,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Now, it would be very unfair for this person to pronounce the Martin"
4007,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"superior to the Raphael, because it then gave him more pleasure. But if"
4008,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"he said, the one is intended to excite the imagination, the other to"
4009,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"gratify the taste, that which fulfils its object most completely must be"
4010,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"the best, whether it give me most pleasure or no; he would be on the"
4011,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"right ground, and might consider the two pictures relatively to one"
4012,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"another, without danger of straying very far from the truth."

4019,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"say they only want brief accounts of such books as are coming out, by"
4020,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],way of saving time. With such we cannot agree. We think the office of
4021,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"the reviewer is, indeed, in part, to point out to the public attention"
4022,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"deserving works, which might otherwise slumber too long unknown on the"
4023,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"bookseller's shelves, but still more to present to the reader as large a"
4024,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"cluster of objects round one point as possible, thus, by suggestion,"
4025,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],stimulating him to take a broader or more careful view of the subject

4031,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"cannot, generally, in our busy state of things, be important or"

4034,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"mediums. Here, where every thing may be spoken or written, and the"
4035,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"powers that be, abused without ceremony on the very highway, the Muse"
4036,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],has nothing to do with dagger or bowl; hardly is the censor's wand
4037,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"permitted to her hand. Yet is her lyre by no means unheeded, and if it"
4038,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],is rather by refining our tastes than by modelling our opinions that she
4039,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"influences us, yet is that influence far from unimportant. And the time"
4040,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"is coming, perhaps in our day, we may (if war do not untimely check the"
4041,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"national progress) even see and temper its beginning, when the broad"
4042,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"West shall swarm with an active, happy, and cultivated population; when"
4043,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"the South, freed from the incubus which now oppresses her best energies,"
4044,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],shall be able to do justice to the resources of her soil and of her
4045,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"mind; when the East, gathering from every breeze the riches of the old"
4046,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"world, shall be the unwearied and loving agent to those regions which"
4047,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"lie far away from the great deep, our bulwark and our minister. Then"
4048,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],will the division of labor be more complete; then will a surplus of
4049,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"talent be spared from the mart, the forum, and the pulpit; then will the"
4050,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"fine arts assume their proper dignity, as the expression of what is"
4051,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],highest and most ethereal in the mind of a people. Then will our
4052,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"quarries be thoroughly explored, and furnish materials for stately"
4053,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"fabrics to adorn the face of all the land, while our ports shall be"
4054,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],crowded with foreign artists flocking to take lessons in the school of
4055,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],American architecture. Then will our floral treasures be arranged into
4056,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"harmonious gardens, which, environing tasteful homes, shall dimple all"
4057,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],the landscape. Then will our Allstons and our Greenoughs preside over
4058,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"great academies, and be raised far above any need, except of giving"
4059,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],outward form to the beautiful ideas which animate them; and ornament
4060,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],from the exhaustless stores of genius the marble halls where the people
4061,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"meet to rejoice, or to mourn, or where dwell those wise and good whom"
4062,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],the people delight to honor. Then shall music answer to and exalt the
4063,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"national spirit, and the poet's brows shall be graced with the civic as"
4064,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"well as the myrtle crown. Then shall we have an American mind, as well"
4065,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"as an American system, and, no longer under the sad necessity of"
4066,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"exchanging money for thoughts, traffic on perfectly equal terms with the"
4067,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"other hemisphere. Then--ah, not yet!--shall our literature make its own"
4068,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"laws, and give its own watchwords; till then we must learn and borrow"
4069,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],from that of nations who possess a higher degree of cultivation though a
4070,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],much lower one of happiness.
4071,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4072,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"The term Classical, used in its narrow sense, implies a servile"
4073,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"adherence to the Unities, but in its wide and best sense, it means such"
4074,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"a simplicity of plan, selection of actors and events, such judicious"
4075,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"limitations on time and range of subject, as may concentrate the"
4076,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"interest, perfect the illusion, and make the impression most distinct"
4077,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"and forcible. Although no advocates for the old French school, with its"
4078,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"slavish obedience to rule, which introduces follies greater than those"
4079,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"it would guard against, we lay the blame, not on their view of the"
4080,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"drama, but on the then bigoted nationality of the French mind, which"
4081,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"converted the Mussulman prophet into a De Retz, the Roman princess into"
4082,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"a French grisette, and infected the clear and buoyant atmosphere of"
4083,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],Greece with the vapors of the Seine. We speak of the old French Drama:
4084,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"with the modern we do not profess to be acquainted, having met with"
4085,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],scarcely any specimens in our own bookstores or libraries; but if it
4086,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"has been revolutionized with the rest of their literature, it is"
4087,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],probably as unlike as possible to the former models.
4088,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4089,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],We shall speak of productions in the classical spirit first; because Mr.
4090,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Taylor is a disciple of the other school, though otherwise we should"
4091,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],have adopted a contrary course.
4092,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4093,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],The most perfect specimens of this style with which we are acquainted
4094,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"are the Filippo, the Saul, and the Myrrha of Alfieri; the Wallenstein of"
4095,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],Schiller; the Tasso and the Iphigenia of Goethe. England furnishes
4096,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],nothing of the sort. She is thoroughly Shakspearian.
4097,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4098,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"There is no higher pleasure than to see a genius of a wild, impassioned,"
4099,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"many-sided eagerness, restraining its exuberance by its sense of"
4100,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"fitness, taming its extravagance beneath the rule its taste approves,"
4101,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"exhibiting the soul within soul, and the force of the will over all that"
4102,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],we inherit. The _abandon_ of genius has its beauty--far more beautiful
4103,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"its voluntary submission to wise law. A picture, a description, has"
4104,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"beauty, the beauty of life; these pictures, these descriptions, arranged"
4105,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"upon a plan, made subservient to a purpose, have a higher beauty--that"
4106,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"of the mind of man acting upon life. Art is nature, but nature"
4107,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"new-modelled, condensed, and harmonized. We are not merely like mirrors,"
4108,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],to reflect our own times to those more distant. The mind has a light of
4109,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"its own, and by it illumines what it re-creates."
4110,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4111,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"This is the ground of our preference for the classical school, and for"
4112,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],Alfieri beyond all pupils of that school. We hold that if a vagrant bud
4113,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"of poesy here and there be blighted by conforming to its rules, our loss"
4114,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"is more than made up to us by our enjoyment of plan, of symmetry, of the"
4115,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],triumph of genius over multiplied obstacles.
4116,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4117,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],It has been often said that the dramas of Alfieri contrast directly with
4118,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"his character. This is, perhaps, not true; we do but see the depths of"
4119,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"that volcano which in early days boiled over so fiercely. The wild,"
4120,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"infatuated youth often becomes the stern, pitiless old man. Alfieri did"
4121,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"but bend his surplus strength upon literature, and became a despot to"
4122,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"his own haughty spirit, instead of domineering over those of others."
4123,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4124,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"We have selected his three masterpieces, though he, to himself an"
4125,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"inexorable critic, has shown no indulgence to his own works, and the"
4126,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"least successful of those which remain to us, Maria Stuarda, is marked"
4127,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],by great excellence.
4128,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4129,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Filippo has been so ably depicted in a work now well known, ""Carlyle's"
4130,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Life of Schiller,"" that we need not dwell upon it. All the light of the"
4131,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"picture, the softer feelings of the hapless Carlos and Elizabeth, is so"
4132,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"cast, as to make more visible the awing darkness of the tyrant's"
4133,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"perverted mind, deadened to all virtue by a false religion, cold and"
4134,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"hopeless as the dungeons of his own Inquisition, and relentless as"
4135,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],death. Forced by the magic wand of genius into the stifling precincts of
4136,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"this mind, horror-struck that we must sympathize with such a state as"
4137,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"possible to humanity, we rush from the contemplation of the picture, and"
4138,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],would gladly curtain it over in our hall of imagery forever. Yet
4139,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"stigmatize not our poet as a dark master, courting the shade, and hating"
4140,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],the glad lights which love and hope cast upon human nature. The drama
4141,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"has a holy meaning, a patriot moral, and we, above all, should reverence"
4142,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"him, the aristocrat by birth, by education, and by tastes, whose love of"
4143,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],liberty could lead him to such conclusions.

4145,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"In ""Saul,"" a bright rainbow rises, by the aid of the Sun of"
4146,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Righteousness, above the commotion of the tempest. David, the faithful,"
4147,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"the hopeful, combining the æsthetic culture, the winged inspiration of"
4148,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"the poet with the noble pride of Israel's chosen warrior, contrasts"
4149,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"finely with the unfortunate Saul, his mind darkened and convulsed by"
4150,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"jealousy, vain regrets, and fear of the God he has forgotten how to"
4151,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],love. The other three actors shade in the picture without attracting our
4152,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],attention from the two principal personages. The Hebrew spirit breathes
4153,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],through the whole. The beauty of the lyric effusions is so generally
4154,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"felt, that encomium is needless; we shall only observe that in them"
4155,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Alfieri's style, usually so severe, becomes flexible, melodious, and"
4156,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"glowing; thus we may easily perceive what he might have done, had not"
4157,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],the simplicity of his genius disdained the foreign aid of ornament upon
4158,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],its Doric proportions.
4159,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4160,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Myrrha is, however, the highest exertion of his genius. The remoteness"
4161,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"of time and manners, the subject, at once so hackneyed and so revolting,"
4162,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"these great obstacles he seizes with giant grasp, and moulds them to his"
4163,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],purpose. Our souls are shaken to the foundation; all every-day barriers
4164,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"fall with the great convulsion of passion. We sorrow, we sicken, we die"
4165,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"with the miserable girl, so pure under her involuntary crime of feeling,"
4166,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"pursued by a malignant deity in her soul's most sacred recesses, torn"
4167,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"from all communion with humanity, and the virtue she was framed to"
4168,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"adore. The perfection of plan, the matchless skill with which every"
4169,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],circumstance is brought out! The agonizing rapidity with which her
4170,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"misery ""va camminando al fine""! No! never was higher tragic power"
4171,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"exhibited; never were love, terror, pity, fused into a more penetrating"
4172,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],draught! Myrrha is a favorite acting-play in Italy--a fact inconceivable
4173,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],to an English or American mind; for (to say nothing of other objections)
4174,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],we should think such excess of emotion unbearable. But in those meridian
4175,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],climes they drink deep draughts of passion too frequently to taste them
4176,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],as we do.
4177,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4178,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"We pass to works of far inferior power, but of greater beauty. We have"
4179,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],selected Iphigenia and Tasso as the most finished results of their
4180,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"author's mature views of art. On his plays in the Romantic style, we"
4181,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],shall touch in another place. If any one ask why we do not class Faust
4182,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"with either, we reply, that is a work without a parallel; one of those"
4183,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"few originals which have their laws within themselves, and should always"
4184,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],be discussed singly.
4185,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4186,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],The unity of plan in Iphigenia is perfect. There is one pervading idea.
4187,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"The purity of Iphigenia's mind must be kept unsullied, that she may be a"
4188,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"fit intercessor to the gods in behalf of her polluted family. Goethe,"
4189,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"in his travels through Italy, saw a picture of a youthful Christian"
4190,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"saint--Agatha, we think; struck by the radiant purity of her expression,"
4191,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],he resolved his heathen priestess should not have one thought which
4192,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],could revolt the saint of the true religion. This idea is wonderfully
4193,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],preserved throughout a drama so classic in its coloring and manners. The
4194,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"happiest development of character, an interest in the denouement which"
4195,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"is only so far tempered by our trust in the lovely heroine, as to permit"
4196,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"us to enjoy all the minuter beauties on our way, (this the breathless"
4197,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"interest of Alfieri's dramas hardly allows, on a fourth or fifth"
4198,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"reading,) exquisite descriptive touches, and expressions of sentiment,"
4199,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"unequalled softness and harmony of style, distinguish a drama not to be"
4200,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],surpassed in its own department. Torquato Tasso[17] is of inferior
4201,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"general, but greater particular beauty. The two worldly, the two higher"
4202,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"characters, with that of Alphonso halting between, are shaded with equal"
4203,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],delicacy and distinctness. The inward-turning imagination of the
4204,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"ill-fated bard, and the fantastic tricks it plays with life, are painted"
4205,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"as only a poet's soul of equal depth, of greater versatility, could have"
4206,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"painted them. In analysis of the passions, and eloquent descriptions of"
4207,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"their more hidden workings, some parts may vie with Rousseau; while"
4208,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"several effusions of feeling are worthy of Tasso's own lyre, with its"
4209,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"""breaking heartstring's tone."" The conduct of the piece being in perfect"
4210,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"accordance with the plan, gives the satisfaction we have mentioned in"
4211,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],speaking of Raphael's Madonna.
4212,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4213,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Schiller's Wallenstein does not strictly belong to this class, yet we"
4214,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],are disposed to claim it as observing the unities of time and interest;
4215,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"the latter especially is entire, notwithstanding the many actors and"
4216,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],side-scenes which are introduced. Numberless touches of nature arrest
4217,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"our attention, bright lights are flashed across many characters, but our"
4218,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"interest, momently increasing, is for Wallenstein--for the perversion,"
4219,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"the danger, the ruin of that monarch soul, that falling son of the"
4220,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"morning. Even that we feel in Max, with his celestial bloom of heart, in"
4221,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Thekla's sweet trustfulness, is subsidiary. This work, generally known"
4222,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"to the reader through Mr. Coleridge's translation, affords an imperfect"
4223,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],illustration of our meaning. Miss Baillie's plays on the passions hold a
4224,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],middle place. Unity of purpose there is--no unity of plan or conduct.
4225,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Bold, fine outline--very bad coloring. Profound, beautifully-expressed"
4226,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],reflections on the passions--utter want of skill in showing them out; a
4227,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"thorough feeling, indeed, of the elements of tragedy,--had but the"
4228,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],vitalizing energy been added. Her plays are failures; but since she has
4229,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"given us nothing else, we cannot but rejoice in having these. 'Tis great"
4230,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],pity that the authoress of De Montfort and Basil should not have
4231,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],attempted a narrative poem.
4232,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4233,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],Coleridge and Byron are signal instances how peculiar is the kind of
4234,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"talent required for the drama; one a philosopher, both men of great"
4235,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"genius and uncommon mastery over language, both conversant with each"
4236,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"side of human nature, both considering the drama in its true light as"
4237,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"one of the highest departments of literature, both utterly wanting in"
4238,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"simplicity, pathos, truth of passion and liveliness of action--in that"
4239,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"thrilling utterance of heart to heart, whose absence _here_, no other"
4240,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"excellence can atone for. Of Maturin and Knowles we do not speak,"
4241,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"because theirs, though very good acting plays, are not, like Mr."
4242,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Taylor's, written for the closet; of Milman, because not sufficiently"
4243,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],acquainted with his plays. We would here pay a tribute to our countryman
4244,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Hillhouse, whose Hadad, read at a very early age, we remember with much"
4245,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],delight. Probably our judgment now might be different; but a work which
4246,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"could make so deep an impression on any age, must have genius. We are"
4247,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"sorry we have never since met it in any library or parlor, and are not"
4248,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],competent to speak of it more particularly.
4249,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4250,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],It will be seen that Mr. Taylor has not attempted the sort of dramatic
4251,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"poetry which we consider the highest, but has labored in that which the"
4252,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"great wizard of Avon adopted, because it lay nearest at hand to clothe"
4253,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"his spells withal, and consecrated it, with his world-embracing genius,"
4254,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],to the (in our judgment) no small detriment of his country's taste.
4255,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],Having thus declared that we cannot grant him our very highest meed of
4256,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"admiration, (though we will not say that he might not win it if he made"
4257,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"the essay,) we hasten to meet him on his own ground. ""Dramatica Poesis"
4258,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"est veluti Historia spectabilis,"" is his motto, taken from Bacon, who"
4259,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],formed his taste on Shakspeare. We would here mention that Goethe's
4260,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"earlier works, Goetz von Berlichingen and Egmont are of this"
4261,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"school--brilliant fragments of past days, ballads acted out, historical"
4262,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],scenes and personages clustered round a hero; and we have seen that his
4263,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],ripened taste preferred the form of Iphigenia and Tasso.
4264,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4265,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],We cannot too strongly express our approbation of the opinions
4266,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],maintained in his short preface to this work. We rejoice to see a leader
4267,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],coming forward who is likely to un-Hemansize and un-Cornwallize
4268,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"literature. We too have been sick, we too have been intoxicated with"
4269,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],_words_ till we could hardly appreciate thoughts; perhaps our present
4270,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],writing shows traces of this Lower-Empire taste; but we have sense
4271,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"enough left to welcome the English Phocion, who would regenerate public"
4272,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],feeling. The candor and modest dignity with which these opinions are
4273,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"offered charm us. The remarks upon Shelley, whom we have loved, and do"
4274,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"still love passing well, brought truth home to us in a definite shape."
4275,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"With regard to the lowness of Lord Byron's standard of character, every"
4276,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],thing indeed has been said which could be but not as Mr. Taylor has
4277,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],said it; and we opine that his refined and gentle remarks will find
4278,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],their way to ears which have always been deaf to the harsh sarcasms
4279,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"unseasoned by wit, which have been current on this topic."
4280,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4281,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Our author too, notwithstanding his modest caveat, has acted upon his"
4282,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"principles, and furnished a forcible illustration of their justice. For"
4283,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"dignity of sentiment, for simplicity of manner, for truth to life, never"
4284,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"infringing upon respect for the ideal, we look to such a critic, and we"
4285,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],are not disappointed.
4286,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4287,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"The scene is laid in Ghent, in the fourteenth century. The Flemish"
4288,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],mobocracy are brought before us with a fidelity and animation surpassing
4289,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"those displayed in Egmont. Their barbarism, and the dissimilar, but not"
4290,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"inferior barbarism of their would-be lords, the bold, bad men, the"
4291,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"shameless crime and brainless tumult of those days, live before us. Amid"
4292,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"these clashing elements moves Philip Van Artevelde, with the presence,"
4293,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"not of a god, but of a great man, too superior to be shaken, too wise to"
4294,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"be shocked by their rude jarrings. He becomes the leader of his people,"
4295,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"and despite pestilence, famine, and their own untutored passions, he"
4296,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],leads them on to victory and power.
4297,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4298,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],In the second part we follow Van Artevelde from his zenith of glory to
4299,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"his decline. The tarnishing influence of prosperity on his spirit, and"
4300,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"its clear radiance again in adversity, are managed as the noble and"
4301,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],well-defined conception of the character deserves.
4302,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4303,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"The boy king and his courtly, intriguing counsellors are as happily"
4304,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"portrayed as Vauclaire and the fierce commonalty he ruled, or resisted"
4305,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"with rope or sword, as the case might demand."
4306,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4307,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"The two loves of Van Artevelde are finely imagined, as types of the two"
4308,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],states of his character. Both are lovely; the one how elevated! the
4309,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],other how pity-moving in her loveliness! On the interlude of Elena we
4310,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"must be allowed to linger fondly, though the author's self condemn our"
4311,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],taste.
4312,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4313,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],We are no longer partial to the machinery of portents and presentiments.
4314,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Wallenstein's were the last we liked, but Van Artevelde's make good"
4315,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"poetry, and have historical vouchers. They remind us of those of Fergus"
4316,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],Mac Ivor.
4317,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4318,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"We shall extract a speech of Van Artevelde's, in which a leading idea of"
4319,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],the work is expressed.
4320,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4321,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Father,--"
4322,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4323,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],So! with the chivalry of Christendom
4324,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"I wage my war,--no nation for my friend,"
4325,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],Yet in each nation having hosts of friends.
4326,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"The bondsmen of the world, that to their lords"
4327,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Are bound with chains of iron, unto me"
4328,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],Are knit by their affections. Be it so.
4329,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],From kings and nobles will I seek no more
4330,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Aid, friendship, or alliance. With the poor"
4331,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],I make my treaty; and the heart of man
4332,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Sets the broad seal of its allegiance there,"
4333,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"And ratifies the compact. Vassals, serfs,"
4334,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Ye that are bent with unrequited toil,"
4335,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Ye that have whitened in the dungeon's darkness,"
4336,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Through years that know not change of night nor day,"
4337,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Tatterdemalions, lodgers in the hedge,"
4338,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Lean beggars with raw backs, and rumbling maws,"
4339,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Whose poverty was whipped for starving you,--"
4340,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"I hail you my auxiliars and allies,"
4341,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],The only potentates whose help I crave!
4342,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Richard of England, thou hast slain Jack Straw,"
4343,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],But thou hast left unquenched the vital spark
4344,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],That set Jack Straw on fire.   The spirit lives;
4345,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"And as when he of Canterbury fell,"
4346,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"His seat was filled by some no better clerk,"
4347,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"So shall John Ball, that slew him, be replaced."
4348,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4349,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],Fain would we extract Van Artevelde's reply to the French envoy--the
4350,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"oration of the dying Van den Bosch in the market-place of Ypres, the"
4351,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"last scene between the hero and the double-dyed dastard and traitor, Sir"
4352,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Heurant of Heurlée, and many, many more, had we but space enough."
4353,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4354,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"We have purposely avoided telling the story, as is usual in an article"
4355,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"of this kind, because we wish that every one should buy and read Van"
4356,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Artevelde, instead of resting content with the canvas side of the"
4357,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],carpet.
4358,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4359,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"A few words more, and we shall conclude these, we fear, already too"
4360,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],prolonged remarks. We would compare Mr. Taylor with the most applauded
4361,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"of living dramatists, the Italian Alessandro Manzoni."
4362,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4363,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"To wide and accurate historical knowledge, to purity of taste, to the"
4364,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"greatest elevation of sentiment, Manzoni unites uncommon lyric power,"
4365,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],and a beautiful style in the most beautiful language of the modern
4366,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"world. The conception of both his plays is striking, the detached"
4367,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"beauties of thought and imagery are many; but where are the life, the"
4368,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"glow, the exciting march of action, the thorough display of character"
4369,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],which charm us in Van Artevelde? We _live_ at Ghent and Senlis; we
4370,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"_think_ of Italy. Van Artevelde dies,--and our hearts die with him. When"
4371,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"Elena says, ""The body,--O!"" we could echo that ""long, funereal note,"""
4372,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],and weep as if the sun of heroic nobleness were quenched from our own
4373,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"horizon. ""Carmagnola, Adelchis die,""--we calmly shut the book, and think"
4374,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],how much we have enjoyed it. Manzoni can deeply feel goodness and
4375,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"greatness, but he cannot localize them in the contours of life before"
4376,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"our eyes. His are capital sketches, poems of a deep meaning,--but this,"
4377,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],yes! this _is_ a drama.
4378,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],
4379,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"We cannot conclude more fitly, nor inculcate a precept on the reader"
4380,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"more forcibly, than in Mr. Taylor's own words, with a slight alteration:"
4381,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"""To say that I admire him is to admit that I owe him much; for"
4382,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"admiration is never thrown away upon the mind of him who feels it,"
4383,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],except when it is misdirected or blindly indulged. There is perhaps
4384,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],nothing which more enlarges or enriches the mind than the disposition to
4385,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"lay it genially open to impressions of pleasure, from the exercise of"
4386,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],every species of talent; nothing by which it is more impoverished than
4387,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"the habit of undue depreciation. What is puerile, pusillanimous, or"
4388,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"wicked, it can do us no good to admire; but let us admire all that can"
4389,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],be admired without debasing the dispositions or stultifying the
4390,PHILIP VAN ARTEVELDE.[16],"understanding."""

4502,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,"the blood of sunnier climes glowing and careering in his veins, gave us"
4503,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,the very flower and essence of factitious life. That book sparkled and
4504,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,"frothed like champagne; like that, too, it produced no dull and imbecile"

4545,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,some truths in a more striking light than heretofore. D'Israeli shows
4546,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,the taint of old prejudice in the necessity he felt to marry the
4547,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,daughter of the people to one _not_ of the people. Those worthy to be
4548,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,"distinguished must still have good blood, or rather old blood, for what"

4553,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,D'Israeli is another of those who give testimony in behalf of our
4554,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,favorite idea that a leading feature of the new era will be in new and
4555,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,higher developments of the feminine character. He looks at women as a
4556,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,"man does who is truly in love. He does not paint them well, that is, not"

4564,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,"Sue is a congenial activity with D'Israeli, but with clearer notions of"
4565,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,"what he wants. His ""De Rohan"" is a poor book, though it contains some"
4566,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,"things excellent. But it is faulty,--even more so than is usual with"
4567,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,"him, in heavy exaggerations, and is less redeemed by brilliant effects,"
4568,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,"good schemes, and lively strains of feeling. The wish to unmask Louis"
4569,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,"XIV. is defeated by the hatred with which the character inspired him,"
4570,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,the liberal of the nineteenth century. The Grand Monarque was really
4571,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,"brutally selfish and ignorant, as Sue represents him; but then there"
4572,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,"_was_ a native greatness, which justified, in some degree, the illusion"
4573,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,"he diffused, and which falsifies all Sue's representation. It is not by"
4574,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,"an inventory of facts or traits that what is most vital in character,"
4575,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,"and which makes its due impression on contemporaries, can be apprehended"
4576,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,"or depicted. ""De Rohan"" is worth reading for particulars of an"

4595,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,"dearest to us, and really most interesting, are those who are at least"
4596,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,rooted to the soil. If they are not great enough to be the prophets of
4597,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,"the new era, they at least exhibit the features of their native clime,"
4598,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,and the complexion given by its native air. But Mr. Willis is a son of
4599,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,"Europe, and his writings can interest only the fashionable world of this"
4600,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,"country, which, by imitating Europe, fails entirely of a genius, grace,"
4601,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,"and invention of its own. Still, in their way, they are excellent. They"
4602,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,"are most lively pictures, showing the fine natural organization of the"
4603,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,"writer, on whom none, the slightest symptom of what he is looking for,"
4604,STORY-BOOKS FOR THE HOT WEATHER.,"is thrown away; sparkling with bold, light wit, succinct, and colored"

4636,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],who have long been vainly inquiring at all the bookstores for such a
4637,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],one.
4638,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],
4639,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],In Europe the fame of Shelley has risen superior to the clouds that
4640,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"darkened its earlier days, hiding his true image from his fellow-men,"
4641,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],and from his own sad eyes oftentimes the common light of day. As a
4642,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"thinker, men have learned to pardon what they consider errors in opinion"
4643,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"for the sake of singular nobleness, purity, and love in his main"
4644,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"tendency or spirit. As a poet, the many faults of his works having been"
4645,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"acknowledged, there are room and place to admire his far more numerous"
4646,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],and exquisite beauties.
4647,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],
4648,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"The heart of the man, few, who have hearts of their own, refuse to"
4649,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"reverence, and many, even of devoutest Christians, would not refuse the"
4650,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],book which contains Queen Mab as a Christmas gift. For it has been
4651,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],recognized that the founder of the Christian church would have suffered
4652,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"one to come unto him, who was in faith and love so truly what he sought"
4653,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"in a disciple, without regard to the form his doctrine assumed."
4654,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],
4655,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"The qualities of his poetry have often been analyzed, and the severer"
4656,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"critics, impatient of his exuberance, or unable to use their accustomed"
4657,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"spectacles in the golden mist that broods over all he has done, deny him"
4658,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"high honors; but the soul of aspiring youth, untrammelled by the canons"
4659,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"of taste, and untamed by scholarly discipline, swells into rapture at"
4660,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"his lyric sweetness, finds ambrosial refreshment from his plenteous"
4661,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"fancies, catches fire at his daring thought, and melts into boundless"
4662,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],weeping at his tender sadness--the sadness of a soul betrothed to an
4663,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],ideal unattainable in this present sphere.

4665,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"For ourselves, we dispute not with the _doctrinaires_ or the critics. We"
4666,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],cannot speak dispassionately of an influence that has been so dear to
4667,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],us. Nearer than the nearest companions of life actual has Shelley been
4668,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"to us. Many other great ones have shone upon us, and all who ever did so"
4669,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"shine are still resplendent in our firmament, for our mental life has"
4670,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"not been broken and contradictory, but thus far we ""see what we"
4671,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"foresaw."" But Shelley seemed to us an incarnation of what was sought in"

4675,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"When still in childish years, the ""Hymn to Intellectual Beauty"" fell in"

4677,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"rivulet, made picturesque by a mill a little farther down, sat a party"
4678,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"of young persons gayer than, and almost as inventive, as those that told"
4679,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],the tales recorded by Boccaccio. They were passing a few days in a scene
4680,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"of deep seclusion, there uncared for by tutor or duenna, and with no bar"
4681,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"of routine to check the pranks of their gay, childish fancies. Every day"
4682,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],they assumed parts which through the waking hours must be acted out. One
4683,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],day it was the characters in one of Richardson's novels; and most
4684,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"solemnly we ""my deared"" each other with richest brocade of affability,"
4685,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"and interchanged in long, stiff phrase our sentimental secrets and prim"
4686,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],opinions. But to-day we sought relief in personating birds or insects;
4687,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"and now it was the Libellula who, tired of wild flitting and darting,"
4688,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"rested on the grassy bank and read aloud the ""Hymn to Intellectual"

4690,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],
4691,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],It was one of those chances which we ever remember as the interposition

4703,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"became the owner of Shelley's Poems. It was her Christmas gift, and for"
4704,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],three days and three nights she ceased not to extract its sweets; and
4705,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],how familiar still in memory every object seen from the chair in which
4706,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"she sat enchanted during those three days, memorable to her as those of"

4710,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"this starry soul,--O, could but a De Quincey describe those days in"

4719,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],have not been able to read much. It was not when he tried to express
4720,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"opinions which the wrongs of the world had put into his head, but when"
4721,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],he abandoned himself to the feelings which nature had implanted in his
4722,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"own breast, that Shelley seemed to us so full of inspiration, and it is"
4723,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],so still.

4725,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],In reply to all that can be urged against him by people of whom we do
4726,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"not wish to speak ill,--for surely ""they know not what they do,""--we are"
4727,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],wont simply to refer to the fact that he was the only man who redeemed
4728,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"the human race from suspicion to the embittered soul of Byron. ""Why,"""
4729,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"said Byron, ""he is a man who would willingly die for others. _I am sure"
4730,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"of it._"""
4731,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],
4732,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],Yes! balance that against all the ill you can think of him that he was
4733,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],a man able to live wretched for the sake of speaking sincerely what he
4734,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"supposed to be truth, willing to die for the good of his fellows!"
4735,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],
4736,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"Mr. Foster has spoken well of him as a man: ""Of Shelley's personal"
4737,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],character it is enough to say that it was wholly pervaded by the same
4738,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],unbounded and unquestioning love for his fellow-men--the same holy and
4739,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],fervid hope in their ultimate virtue and happiness--the same scorn of
4740,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],baseness and hatred of oppression--which beam forth in all his writings
4741,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],with a pure and constant light. The theory which he wrote was the
4742,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"practice which his whole life exemplified. Noble, kind, generous,"
4743,SHELLEY'S POEMS[18],"passionate, tender, with a courage greater than the courage of the chief"

4753,FESTUS.[19],We are right glad to see this beloved stranger domesticated among us.
4754,FESTUS.[19],Yet there are queer little circumstances that herald the introduction.
4755,FESTUS.[19],The poet is a barrister at law!--well! it is always worthy of note when
4756,FESTUS.[19],a man is not hindered by study of human law from knowledge of divine;
4757,FESTUS.[19],which last is all that concerns the poet. Then the preface to the
4758,FESTUS.[19],"American edition closes with this discreet remark: ""It is perfectly SAFE"
4759,FESTUS.[19],to pronounce it (the poem) one of the most powerful and splendid
4760,FESTUS.[19],"productions of the age."" Dear New England! how purely that was worthy"
4761,FESTUS.[19],"thee, region where the tyranny of public opinion is carried to a"
4762,FESTUS.[19],perfection of minute scrutiny beyond what it ever was before in any age
4763,FESTUS.[19],"or place, though the ostracism be administered with the mildness and"
4764,FESTUS.[19],refinement fit for this age. Dear New England! yes! it is _safe_ to say
4765,FESTUS.[19],"that the poem is good; whatever Mrs. Grundy may think, she will not have"
4766,FESTUS.[19],"it burned by the hangman if it is not. But it may not be _discreet_,"
4767,FESTUS.[19],"because she can, if she sees fit, exile its presence from bookstores,"
4768,FESTUS.[19],"libraries, centre tables, and all mention of its existence from lips"
4769,FESTUS.[19],"polite, and of thine also, who hast dared to praise it, on peril of"
4770,FESTUS.[19],turning all surrounding eyes to lead by its utterance. This kind of
4771,FESTUS.[19],"gentle excommunication thou mayst not be prepared to endure, O"
4772,FESTUS.[19],preface-writer! And we should greatly fear that thou wert deceived in
4773,FESTUS.[19],"thy fond security, for ""Festus"" is a bold book--in respect of freedom of"
4774,FESTUS.[19],"words, a boldest book--also it reveals the solitudes of hearts with"
4775,FESTUS.[19],"unexampled sincerity, and remorselessly lays bare human nature in its"
4776,FESTUS.[19],"naked truth--but for the theology of the book. That may save it, and"
4777,FESTUS.[19],none the less for all it shows of the depravity of human nature. It is
4778,FESTUS.[19],"through many pages and leaves what is technically praised as ""a serious"
4779,FESTUS.[19],"book."" A friend went into a bookstore to select presents for persons"
4780,FESTUS.[19],"with whom she was about to part, and among other things requested the"
4781,FESTUS.[19],"shopman to ""show her some serious books in handsome binding."" He looked"
4782,FESTUS.[19],"into several, and then, struck by passages here and there, offered her"
4783,FESTUS.[19],"the ""Letters of Lady M. W. Montague."" She assuring him that it would not"
4784,FESTUS.[19],"be safe to make use of this work, he offered her a miniature edition of"
4785,FESTUS.[19],"Shakspeare, as ""a book containing many excellent things, though you had"
4786,FESTUS.[19],"to wade through a great deal of rubbish to get at them."""
4787,FESTUS.[19],
4788,FESTUS.[19],"We fear the reader will have to wade through a great deal of ""rubbish"""
4789,FESTUS.[19],"in ""Festus"" before he gets at the theology. However, there it is, in"
4790,FESTUS.[19],"sufficient quantities to give dignity to any book. In seriousness, it"
4791,FESTUS.[19],"may compete with Pollok's ""Course of Time."" In ""splendor and power,"" we"
4792,FESTUS.[19],"feel ourselves safe in saying that, as sure as the sun shines, it cannot"
4793,FESTUS.[19],"be outdone in the English tongue, thus far, short of Milton. So there is"
4794,FESTUS.[19],"something for all classes of readers, and we hope it will get to their"
4795,FESTUS.[19],"eyes, albeit Boston books are not likely to be detected by all eyes to"
4796,FESTUS.[19],which they belong.
4797,FESTUS.[19],
4798,FESTUS.[19],"To ourselves the theology of this writer, and the conscious design of"
4799,FESTUS.[19],"the poem, have little interest. They seem to us, like the color of his"
4800,FESTUS.[19],"skin and hair, the result of the circumstances under which he was born."
4801,FESTUS.[19],"Certain opinions came in his way early, and became part of the body of"
4802,FESTUS.[19],"his thought. But what interests us is not these, but what is deepest,"
4803,FESTUS.[19],universal--the soul of that body. To us the poem is
4804,FESTUS.[19],
4805,FESTUS.[19],"""... full of great dark meanings like the sea:"""
4806,FESTUS.[19],
4807,FESTUS.[19],"and it is these, the deep experiences and inspirations of the immortal"
4808,FESTUS.[19],"man, that engage us."
4809,FESTUS.[19],
4810,FESTUS.[19],Even the poem shows how large is his nature--its most careless utterance
4811,FESTUS.[19],"full of grandeur, its tamest of bold nobleness. This, that truly engages"
4812,FESTUS.[19],"us, he spoke of more forcibly when the book first went forth to the"
4813,FESTUS.[19],world:--
4814,FESTUS.[19],
4815,FESTUS.[19],"""Read this, world. He who writes is dead to thee,"
4816,FESTUS.[19],But still lives in these leaves. He spake inspired;
4817,FESTUS.[19],"Night and day, thought came unhelped, undesired,"
4818,FESTUS.[19],Like blood to his heart. The course of study he
4819,FESTUS.[19],Went through was of the soul-rack. The degree
4820,FESTUS.[19],He took was high; it was wise wretchedness.
4821,FESTUS.[19],"He suffered perfectly, and gained no less"
4822,FESTUS.[19],"A prize than, in his own torn heart, to see"
4823,FESTUS.[19],"A few bright seeds; he sowed them, hoped them truth."
4824,FESTUS.[19],"The autumn of that seed is in these pages."""
4825,FESTUS.[19],
4826,FESTUS.[19],"Such is, in our belief, the true theologian, the learner of God, who"
4827,FESTUS.[19],does not presumptuously expect at this period of growth to bind down all
4828,FESTUS.[19],"that is to be known of divine things in a system, a set of words, but"
4829,FESTUS.[19],"considers that he is only spelling the first lines of a work, whose"
4830,FESTUS.[19],perusal shall last him through eternity. Such a one is not in a hurry to
4831,FESTUS.[19],"declare that the riddles of Fate and of Time are solved, for he knows it"
4832,FESTUS.[19],is not calling them so that will make them so. His soul does not decline
4833,FESTUS.[19],the great and persevering labors that are to develop its energies. He
4834,FESTUS.[19],has faith to study day by day. Such is the practice of the author of
4835,FESTUS.[19],"Festus, whenever he is truly great. When he shows to us the end and plan"
4836,FESTUS.[19],"of all things, we feel that he only hides them from us. He speaks only"
4837,FESTUS.[19],"his wishes. But when he tells us of what he does really know, the moods"
4838,FESTUS.[19],and aspirations of fiery youth to which all things are made present in
4839,FESTUS.[19],"foresight and foretaste,--when he shows us the temptations of the lonely"
4840,FESTUS.[19],"soul pining for knowledge, but unable to feel the love that alone can"
4841,FESTUS.[19],"bestow it,--then he is truly great, and the strings of life thrill"
4842,FESTUS.[19],"oftentimes to their sublimest, sweetest music."
4843,FESTUS.[19],
4844,FESTUS.[19],We admire in this author the unsurpassed force and distinctness with
4845,FESTUS.[19],which he casts out single thoughts and images. Each is thrown before us
4846,FESTUS.[19],"fresh, deep in its impress as if just snatched from the forge. We admire"
4847,FESTUS.[19],"not less his vast flow, his sustained flight. His is a rich and spacious"
4848,FESTUS.[19],genius; it gives us room; it is a palace home; we need not economize our
4849,FESTUS.[19],joys; blessed be the royalty that welcomes us so freely.
4850,FESTUS.[19],
4851,FESTUS.[19],"In simple transposition of the thought from the mind to the paper, that"
4852,FESTUS.[19],"wonder, even rarer than perfect,--that is, simple expression, through"
4853,FESTUS.[19],"the motions of the body, of the motions of the soul,--we dare to say"
4854,FESTUS.[19],"_no_ writer excels him. Words are no veil between us and him, but a"
4855,FESTUS.[19],luminous cloud that upbears us both together.
4856,FESTUS.[19],
4857,FESTUS.[19],"So in touches of nature, in the tones of passion; he is absolute. There"
4858,FESTUS.[19],"is nothing better, where it is good; we have the very thing itself."
4859,FESTUS.[19],
4860,FESTUS.[19],"We are told by the critics that he has no ear, and, indeed, when we"
4861,FESTUS.[19],"listen for such, we perceive blemishes enough in the movement of his"
4862,FESTUS.[19],"line. But we did not perceive it before, more than, when the Æolian was"
4863,FESTUS.[19],telling the secrets of that most spirit-like minister of Nature that
4864,FESTUS.[19],"bloweth where it listeth, and no man can trace it, we should attempt to"
4865,FESTUS.[19],"divide the tones and pauses into regular bars, and be disturbed when we"
4866,FESTUS.[19],could not make a tune.
4867,FESTUS.[19],
4868,FESTUS.[19],England has only two poets now that can be named near him: these two are
4869,FESTUS.[19],"Tennyson and the author of ""Philip Van Artevelde."" Tennyson is all that"
4870,FESTUS.[19],"Bailey is not in melody and voluntary finish, having no less than a"
4871,FESTUS.[19],Greek moderation in declining all undertakings he is not sure of
4872,FESTUS.[19],"completing. Taylor, noble, an earnest seer, a faithful narrator of what"
4873,FESTUS.[19],"he sees, firm and sure, sometimes deep and exquisite, but in energy and"
4874,FESTUS.[19],grandeur no more than Tennyson to be named beside the author of Festus.
4875,FESTUS.[19],"In inspiration, in prophecy, in those flashes of the sacred fire which"
4876,FESTUS.[19],reveal the secret places where Time is elaborating the marvels of
4877,FESTUS.[19],"Nature, he stands alone. It is just true what Ebenezer Elliott says,"
4878,FESTUS.[19],"that ""Festus contains poetry enough to set up fifty poets,""--ay! even"
4879,FESTUS.[19],"such poets, so far as richness of thought and imagery are concerned, as"
4880,FESTUS.[19],the two noble bards we have named.
4881,FESTUS.[19],
4882,FESTUS.[19],"But we need call none less to make him greater, whose liberal soul is"
4883,FESTUS.[19],"alive to every shade of beauty, every token of greatness, and whose main"
4884,FESTUS.[19],stress is to seek a soul of goodness in things evil. The book is a
4885,FESTUS.[19],"precious, even a sacred book, and we could say more of it, had we not"
4886,FESTUS.[19],years ago vented our enthusiasm when it was in first full flow.

4894,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],WE hear much lamentation among good people at the introduction of so
4895,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"many French novels among us, corrupting, they say, our youth by pictures"
4896,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"of decrepit vice and prurient crime, such as would never, otherwise, be"
4897,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"dreamed of here, and corrupting it the more that such knowledge is so"
4898,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],precocious--for the same reason that a boy may be more deeply injured by
4899,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"initiation into wickedness than a man, for he is not only robbed of his"
4900,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"virtue, but prevented from developing the strength that might restore"
4901,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],it. But it is useless to bewail what is the inevitable result of the
4902,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"movement of our time. Europe must pour her corruptions, no less than her"
4903,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"riches, on our shores, both in the form of books and of living men. She"
4904,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"cannot, if she would, check the tide which bears them hitherward; no"
4905,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"defences are possible, on our vast extent of shore, that can preclude"
4906,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],their ingress. We have exulted in premature and hasty growth; we must
4907,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],brace ourselves to bear the evils that ensue. Our only hope lies in
4908,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"rousing, in our own community, a soul of goodness, a wise aspiration,"
4909,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],that shall give us strength to assimilate this unwholesome food to
4910,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"better substance, or cast off its contaminations. A mighty sea of life"
4911,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"swells within our nation, and, if there be salt enough, foreign bodies"
4912,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],shall not have power to breed infection there.
4913,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],
4914,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],We have had some opportunity to observe that the worst works offered are
4915,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"rejected. On the steamboats we have seen translations of vile books,"
4916,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],bought by those who did not know from the names of their authors what
4917,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"to expect, torn, after a cursory glance at their contents, and scattered"

4951,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"this class not without envy, for I had been told pretty tales of the gay"

4963,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],beneath the mantle of pride with the bitter mood of a Spaniard. But
4964,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],Balzac evidently is familiar with that which makes the agony of

4971,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],These French writers possess the art of plunging at once _in medias

5002,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"The book affords play for similar powers, and brings a similar range of"

5004,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"that work, it is more original, and has a force of pencil all its own."
5005,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],
5006,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],Insight and a master's hand are admirable throughout; but the product of
5007,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"genius is _Le Père Goriot_. And, wonderful to relate, this character is"
5008,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"as much ennobled, made as poetical by abandonment to a single instinct,"
5009,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"as others by the force of will. Prometheus, chained on his rock, and"
5010,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"giving his heart to the birds of prey for aims so majestic, is scarcely"
5011,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"a more affecting, a more reverent object, than the rich confectioner"
5012,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"whose intellect has never been awakened at all, except in the way of"
5013,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"buying and selling, and who gives up his acuteness even there, and"
5014,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],commits such unspeakable follies through paternal love; a _blind_ love
5015,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"too, nowise superior to that of the pelican!"

5017,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"Analyze it as you will, see the difference between this and the instinct"
5018,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"of the artist or the philanthropist, and it produces on your mind the"
5019,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],same impression of a present divinity. And scarce any tears could be
5020,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],more sacred than those which choke the breath at the death-bed of this
5021,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"man, who forgot that he was a man, to be wholly a father, this poor,"
5022,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"mad, stupid, father Goriot. I know nothing in fiction to surpass the"

5024,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],the mistaken benediction given to the two medical students whom he takes
5025,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"for his daughters, is redeemed from burlesque."

5027,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"The scepticism as to _virtue_ in this book is fearful, but the love for"
5028,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],innocence and beautiful instincts casts a softening tint over the gloom.
5029,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],We never saw any thing sweeter or more natural than the letters of the
5030,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"mother and sisters of Eugene, when they so delightfully sent him the"
5031,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],money of which he had been wicked enough to plunder them. These traits
5032,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],of domestic life are given with much grace and delicacy of sentiment.
5033,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],
5034,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"How few writers can paint _abandon_, without running into exaggeration!"
5035,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],and here the task was one of peculiar difficulty. It seemed as if the
5036,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],writer were conscious enough of his power to propose to himself the most
5037,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],difficult task he could undertake.
5038,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],
5039,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"A respectable reviewer in ""Les Deux Mondes"" would wish us to think that"
5040,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],there is no life in Paris like what Balzac paints; but we can never
5041,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"believe that: evidently it is ""too true,"" though we doubt not there is"

5046,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],
5047,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"Balzac has been a very fruitful writer, and, as he is fond of jugglers'"
5048,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"tricks of every description, and holds nothing earnest or sacred, he is"
5049,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"vain of the wonderful celerity with which some of his works, and those"
5050,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"quite as good as any, have been written. They seem to have been"
5051,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"conceived, composed, and written down with that degree of speed with"
5052,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"which it is possible to lay pen to paper. Indeed, we think he cannot be"
5053,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],surpassed in the ready and sustained command of his resources. His
5054,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"almost unequalled quickness and fidelity of eye, both as to the"
5055,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"disposition of external objects, and the symptoms of human passion,"
5056,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"combined with a strong memory, have filled his mind with materials, and"
5057,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],we doubt not that if his thoughts could be put into writing with the
5058,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"swiftness of thought, he would give us one of his novels every week in"
5059,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],the year.
5060,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],
5061,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"Here end our praises of Balzac; what he is, as a man, in daily life, we"
5062,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"know not. He must originally have had a heart, or he could not read so"
5063,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],well the hearts of others; perhaps there are still private ties that
5064,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"touch him. But as a writer, never was the modern Mephistopheles, ""the"
5065,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"spirit that denieth,"" more worthily represented than by Balzac."
5066,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],
5067,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],He combines the spirit of the man of science with that of the amateur
5068,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"collector. He delights to analyze, to classify; there is no anomaly too"
5069,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"monstrous, no specimen too revolting, to insure his ardent but"
5070,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],passionless scrutiny. But then he has taste and judgment to know what is
5071,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"fair, rare, and exquisite. He takes up such an object carefully, and"
5072,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"puts it in a good light. But he has no hatred for what is loathsome, no"
5073,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"contempt for what is base, no love for what is lovely, no faith in what"
5074,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],is noble. To him there is no virtue and no vice; men and women are more
5075,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],or less finely organized; noble and tender conduct is more agreeable
5076,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"than the reverse, because it argues better health; that is all."
5077,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],
5078,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"Nor is this from an intellectual calmness, nor from an unusual power of"
5079,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"analyzing motives, and penetrating delusions merely; neither is it mere"
5080,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"indifference. There is a touch of the demon, also, in Balzac, the cold"
5081,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],but gayly familiar demon; and the smile of the amateur yields easily to
5082,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"a sneer, as he delights to show you on what foul juices the fair flower"
5083,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],was fed. He is a thorough and willing materialist. The trance of
5084,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],religion is congestion of the brain; the joy of the poet the thrilling
5085,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],of the blood in the rapture of sense; and every good not only rises
5086,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"from, but hastens back into, the jaws of death and nothingness; a"
5087,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],rainbow arch above a pestilential chaos!
5088,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],
5089,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"Thus Balzac, with all his force and fulness of talent, never rises one"
5090,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"moment into the region of genius. For genius is, in its nature, positive"
5091,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"and creative, and cannot exist where there is no heart to believe in"
5092,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],realities. Neither can he have a permanent influence on a nature which
5093,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],is not thoroughly corrupt. He might for a while stagger an ingenuous
5094,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],mind which had not yet thought for itself. But this could not last. His
5095,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],unbelief makes his thought too shallow. He has not that power which a
5096,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"mind, only in part sophisticated, may retain, where the heart still"
5097,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"beats warmly, though it sometimes beats amiss. Write, paint, argue, as"
5098,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"you will, where there is a sound spot in any human being, he cannot be"
5099,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],made to believe that this present bodily frame is more than a temporary
5100,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"condition of his being, though one to which he may have become"
5101,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"shamefully enslaved by fault of inheritance, education, or his own"
5102,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],carelessness.
5103,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],
5104,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"Taken in his own way, we know no modern tragedies more powerful than"
5105,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"Balzac's ""Eugenie Grandet,"" ""Sweet Pea,"" ""Search after the Absolute,"""
5106,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"""Father Goriot."" See there goodness, aspiration, the loveliest"
5107,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"instincts, stifled, strangled by fate, in the form of our own brute"
5108,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],nature. The fate of the ancient Prometheus was happiness to that of
5109,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"these, who must pay, for ever having believed there was divine fire in"
5110,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"heaven, by agonies of despair, and conscious degradation, unknown to"
5111,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],those who began by believing man to be the most richly endowed of
5112,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],brutes--no more!
5113,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],
5114,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"Balzac is admirable in his description of look, tone, gesture. He has a"
5115,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],keen sense of whatever is peculiar to the individual. Nothing in modern
5116,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"romance surpasses the death-scene of Father Goriot, the Parisian Lear,"
5117,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],in the almost immortal life with which the parental instincts are
5118,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],displayed. And with equal precision and delicacy of shading he will
5119,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],paint the slightest by-play in the manners of some young girl.
5120,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],
5121,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"""Seraphitus"" is merely a specimen of his great powers of intellectual"
5122,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],transposition. Amid his delight at the botanical riches of the new and
5123,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"elevated region in which he is travelling, we catch, if only by echo,"
5124,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],the hem and chuckle of the French materialist.
5125,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],
5126,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],No more of him!--We leave him to his suicidal work.
5127,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],
5128,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],It is cheering to know how great is the influence such a writer as Sue
5129,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"exerts, from his energy of feeling on some subjects of moral interest."
5130,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],It is true that he has also much talent and a various experience of
5131,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"life; but writers who far surpass him here, as we think Balzac does,"
5132,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"wanting this heart of faith, have no influence, except merely on the"
5133,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],tastes of their readers.
5134,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],
5135,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"We observe, in a late notice of Sue, that he began to write at quite"
5136,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"mature age, at the suggestion of a friend. We should think it was so;"
5137,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"that he was by nature intended for a practical man, rather than a"
5138,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],writer. He paints all his characters from the practical point of view.
5139,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],
5140,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"As an observer, when free from exaggeration, he has as good an eye as"
5141,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"Balzac, but he is far more rarely thus free, for, in temperament, he is"
5142,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],unequal and sometimes muddy. But then he has the heart and faith that
5143,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"Balzac wants, yet is less enslaved by emotion than Sand; therefore he"
5144,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],has made more impression on his time and place than either. We refer now
5145,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"to his later works; though his earlier show much talent, yet his"
5146,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"progress, both as a writer and thinker, has been so considerable that"
5147,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],those of the last few years entirely eclipse his earlier essays.
5148,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],
5149,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"These latter works are the ""Mysteries of Paris,"" ""Matilda,"" and the"
5150,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"""Wandering Jew,"" which is now in course of publication. In these, he has"
5151,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"begun, and is continuing, a crusade against the evils of a corrupt"
5152,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],civilization which are inflicting such woes and wrongs upon his
5153,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],contemporaries.
5154,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],
5155,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"Sue, however, does not merely assail, but would build up. His anatomy is"
5156,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"not intended to injure the corpse, or, like that of Balzac, to"
5157,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],entertain the intellectual merely. Earnestly he hopes to learn from it
5158,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],the remedies for disease and the conditions of health. Sue is a
5159,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],Socialist. He believes he sees the means by which the heart of mankind
5160,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"may be made to beat with one great hope, one love; and instinct with"
5161,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"this thought, his tales of horror are not tragedies."
5162,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],
5163,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"This is the secret of the deep interest he has awakened in this country,"
5164,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"that he shares a hope which is, half unconsciously to herself, stirring"
5165,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"all her veins. It is not so warmly outspoken as in other lands, both"
5166,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"because no such pervasive ills as yet call loudly for redress, and"
5167,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"because private conservatism is here great, in proportion to the absence"
5168,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],of authorized despotism. We are not disposed to quarrel with this; it is
5169,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],well for the value of new thoughts to be tested by a good deal of
5170,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"resistance. Opposition, if it does not preclude free discussion, is of"
5171,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"use in educating men to know what they want. Only by intelligent men,"
5172,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"exercised by thought and tried in virtue, can such measures as Sue"
5173,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],proposes be carried out; and when such associates present themselves in
5174,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"sufficient numbers, we have no fear but the cause of association, in its"
5175,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"grander forms, will have fair play in America."
5176,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],
5177,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"As a writer, Sue shows his want of a high kind of imagination by his"
5178,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],unshrinking portraiture of physical horrors. We do not believe any man
5179,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],could look upon some things he describes and live. He is very powerful
5180,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],in his description of the workings of animal nature; especially when he
5181,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"speaks of them in animals merely, they have the simplicity of the lower"
5182,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],kind with the more full expression of human nature. His pictures of
5183,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"women are of rare excellence, and it is observable that the more simple"
5184,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"and pure the character is, the more justice he does to it. This shows"
5185,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"that, whatever his career may have been, his heart is uncontaminated."
5186,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"Men he does not describe so well, and fails entirely when he aims at one"
5187,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],grand and simple enough for a great moral agent. His conceptions are
5188,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"strong, but in execution he is too melodramatic. Just compare _his_"
5189,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"""Wandering Jew"" with that of Beranger. The latter is as diamond compared"
5190,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"with charcoal. Then, like all those writers who write in numbers that"
5191,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"come out weekly or monthly, he abuses himself and his subject; he often"
5192,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],_must_; the arrangement is false and mechanical.
5193,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],
5194,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"The attitude of Sue is at this moment imposing, as he stands, pen in"
5195,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"hand,--this his only weapon against an innumerable host of foes,--the"
5196,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"champion of poverty, innocence, and humanity, against superstition,"
5197,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"selfishness, and prejudice. When his works are forgotten,--and for all"
5198,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"their strong points and brilliant decorations, they may ere long be"
5199,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"forgotten,--still the writer's name shall be held in imperishable honor"
5200,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"as the teacher of the ignorant, the guardian of the weak, a true tribune"
5201,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],for the people of his own time.
5202,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],
5203,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],One of the most unexceptionable and attractive writers of modern France
5204,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],is De Vigny. His life has been passed in the army; but many years of
5205,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"peace have given him time for literary culture, while his acquaintance"
5206,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"with the traditions of the army, from the days of its dramatic"
5207,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"achievements under Bonaparte, supply the finest materials both for"
5208,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"narrative and reflection. His tales are written with infinite grace,"
5209,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"refined sensibility, and a dignified view. His treatment of a subject"
5210,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],shows that closeness of grasp and clearness of sight which are rarely
5211,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],attained by one who is not at home in active as well as thoughtful life.
5212,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"He has much penetration, too, and has touched some of the most delicate"
5213,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],springs of human action. His works have been written in hours of
5214,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"leisure; this has diminished their number, but given him many advantages"
5215,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],over the thousands of professional writers that fill the coffee-houses
5216,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"of Paris by day, and its garrets by night. We wish he were more read"
5217,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"here in the original; with him would be found good French, and the"
5218,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"manners, thoughts, and feelings of a cosmopolitan gentleman."
5219,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],
5220,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],To sum up this imperfect account of the merits of these Novelists: I see
5221,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"De Vigny, a retiring figure, the gentleman, the solitary thinker, but,"
5222,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"in his way, the efficient foe of false honor and superstitious"
5223,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"prejudice; Balzac is the heartless surgeon, probing the wounds and"
5224,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],describing the delirium of suffering men for the amusement of his
5225,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"students; Sue, a bold and glittering crusader, with endless ballads"
5226,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],jingling in the silence of the night before the battle. They are all
5227,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"much right and a good deal wrong; for instance, all who would lay down"
5228,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"their lives for the sake of truth, yet let their virtuous characters"
5229,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"practise stratagems, falsehood, and violence; in fact, do evil for the"
5230,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"sake of good. They still show this taint of the old régime, and no"
5231,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],wonder! La belle France has worn rouge so long that the purest mountain
5232,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"air will not, at once, or soon, restore the natural hues to her"
5233,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"complexion. But they are fine figures, and all ruled by the onward"
5234,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"spirit of the time. Led by that spirit, I see them moving on the"
5235,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"troubled waters; they do not sink, and I trust they will find their way"
5236,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"to the coasts where the new era will introduce new methods, in a spirit"
5237,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"of nobler activity, wiser patience, and holier faith, than the world has"
5238,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],yet seen.
5239,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],
5240,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"Will Balzac also see that shore, or has he only broken away the bars"
5241,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],that hindered others from setting sail? We do not know. When we read an

5244,FRENCH NOVELISTS OF THE DAY.[20],"presently we see him sneering behind the mask, and we fear. Let"

5469,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],is such a tone that each division of our adopted citizens needs to hear
5470,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],from those of their compatriots able to guide and enlighten them. We do
5471,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],want that each nation should preserve what is valuable in its parent
5472,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],stock. We want all the elements for the new people of the new world. We
5473,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],"want the prudence, the honor, the practical skill of the English; the"
5474,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],"fun, the affectionateness, the generosity of the Irish; the vivacity,"
5475,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],"the grace, the quick intelligence of the French; the thorough honesty,"
5476,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],"the capacity for philosophic view, and deep enthusiasm of the German"
5477,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],"Biedermann; the shrewdness and romance of the Scotch,--but we want none"
5478,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],of their prejudices. We want the healthy seed to develop itself into a
5479,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],different plant in the new climate. We have reason to hope a new and
5480,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],"generous race, where the Italian meets the German, the Swede, the Jew."
5481,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],"Let nothing be obliterated, but all be regenerated; let each leader say"
5482,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],in like manner to his band. Apply the old loyalty to a study of new
5483,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],duties. Examine yourself whether you are worthy of the new rights so
5484,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],"freely bestowed upon you, and recognize that only intelligent action,"
5485,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],"and not mere bodily presence, can make you really a citizen on any soil."
5486,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],It is a glorious boon offered you to be a founder of the new dynasty in
5487,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],the new world; but it would have been better for you to have died a
5488,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],"thousand deaths beneath the factory wheels of England, or in the prisons"
5489,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],"of Russia, than to sell this great privilege for selfish or servile"
5490,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],ends. Here each man has before him the choice of Esau--each may defraud
5491,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],a long succession of souls of their princely inheritance.
5492,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],
5493,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],"Do those whose bodies were born upon this soil reject you, and claim for"
5494,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],"themselves the name of natives? You may be natives, in another sort, for"
5495,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],"the soul may be re-born here. Cast for yourselves a new nativity, and"
5496,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],invoke the starry influences that do not fail to shine into the life of
5497,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],"a good man, whose heart is kept open daily to truth in every new form,"
5498,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],whose heart is strengthened by a desire to do his duty valiantly to
5499,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],every brother of the human family. Offer upon the soil a libation of
5500,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],"worthy feelings in gratitude for the bread it so willingly yields you,"
5501,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],"and it is true that the ""healthy mind of the nation"" cannot long fail to"
5502,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],"greet you with joy, and hail your endowment with civic rights."
5503,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],
5504,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],"We must think there is a deep root, in fact, for the late bitter"
5505,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],"expressions of prejudice, however unworthy the mode of exhibiting them,"
5506,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],against the foreign element in our population. We want all this new
5507,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],"blood, but we want it purified, assimilated, or it will take all form of"
5508,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],comeliness from the growing nation. Our country is a willing foster
5509,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],"mother, but her children need wise tutors to prevent them from playing,"
5510,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],"willingly or unwillingly, the viper's part."

5512,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],"There is a little poem in the Schnellpost, by Moritz Hartmann, called"

5562,DEUTSCHE SCHNELLPOST.[22],"could not be done, as there was no criminal under sentence, he desired"

5577,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],A long expectation is rewarded at last by the appearance of this book.
5578,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"We cannot wonder that it should have been long, when Mr. Carlyle shows"
5579,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],us what a world of ill-arranged and almost worthless materials he has
5580,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],had to wade through before achieving any possibility of order and
5581,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],harmony for his narrative.
5582,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],
5583,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],The method which he has chosen of letting the letters and speeches of
5584,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"Cromwell tell the story when possible, only himself doing what is"
5585,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"needful to throw light where it is most wanted and fill up gaps, is an"
5586,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"excellent one. Mr. Carlyle, indeed, is a most peremptory showman, and"
5587,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],with each slide of his magic lantern informs us not only of what is
5588,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"necessary to enable us to understand it, but _how_ we must look at it,"
5589,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"under peril of being ranked as ""imbeciles,"" ""canting sceptics,"""
5590,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"""disgusting rose-water philanthropists,"" and the like. And aware of his"
5591,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],power of tacking a nickname or ludicrous picture to any one who refuses
5592,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"to obey, we might perhaps feel ourselves, if in his neighborhood, under"
5593,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"such constraint and fear of deadly laughter, as to lose the benefit of"
5594,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],having under our eye to form our judgment upon the same materials on
5595,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],which he formed his.
5596,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],
5597,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"But the ocean separates us, and the showman has his own audience of"
5598,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"despised victims, or scarce less despised pupils; and we need not fear"
5599,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"to be handed down to posterity as ""a little gentleman in a gray coat"""
5600,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"""shrieking"" unutterable ""imbecilities,"" or with the like damnatory"
5601,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"affixes, when we profess that, having read the book, and read the"
5602,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"letters and speeches thus far, we cannot submit to the showman's"
5603,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"explanation of the lantern, but must, more than ever, stick to the old"
5604,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"""Philistine,"" ""Dilettante,"" ""Imbecile,"" and what not view of the"
5605,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],character of Cromwell.
5606,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],
5607,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],We all know that to Mr. Carlyle greatness is well nigh synonymous with
5608,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"virtue, and that he has shown himself a firm believer in Providence by"
5609,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],receiving the men of destiny as always entitled to reverence. Sometimes
5610,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],a great success has followed the portraits painted by him in the light
5611,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"of such faith, as with regard to Mahomet, for instance. The natural"
5612,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"autocrat is his delight, and in such pictures as that of the monk in"
5613,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"""Past and Present,"" where the geniuses of artist and subject coincide,"
5614,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],the result is no less delightful for us.
5615,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],
5616,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],But Mr. Carlyle reminds us of the man in a certain parish who had always
5617,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"looked up to one of its squires as a secure and blameless idol, and one"
5618,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"day in church, when the minister asked ""all who felt in concern for"
5619,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"their souls to rise,"" looked to the idol and seeing him retain his seat,"
5620,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],(asleep perchance!) sat still also. One of his friends asking him
5621,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"afterwards how he could refuse to answer such an appeal, he replied, ""he"
5622,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"thought it safest to stay with the squire."""
5623,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],
5624,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"Mr. Carlyle's squires are all Heaven's justices of peace or war,"
5625,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"(usually the latter;) they are beings of true energy and genius, and so"
5626,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"far, as he describes them, ""genuine men."" But in doubtful cases, where"
5627,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"the doubt is between them and principles, he will insist that the men"
5628,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],must be in the right. On such occasions he favors us with such doctrine
5629,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"as the following, which we confess we had the weakness to read with"
5630,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"""sibylline execration"" and extreme disgust."
5631,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],
5632,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],Speaking of Cromwell's course in Ireland:--
5633,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],
5634,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"""Oliver's proceedings here have been the theme of much loud criticism,"
5635,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"sibylline execration, into which it is not our plan to enter at present."
5636,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"We shall give these fifteen letters of his in a mass, and without any"
5637,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],commentary whatever. To those who think that a land overrun with
5638,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"sanguinary quacks can be healed by sprinkling it with rose-water, these"
5639,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],letters must be very horrible. Terrible surgery this; but _is_ it
5640,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"surgery and judgment, or atrocious murder merely? This is a question"
5641,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],which should be asked; and answered. Oliver Cromwell did believe in
5642,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],God's judgments; and did not believe in the rose-water plan of
5643,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"surgery,--which, in fact, is this editor's case too! Every idle lie and"
5644,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"piece of empty bluster this editor hears, he too, like Oliver, has to"
5645,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"shudder at it; has to think, 'Thou, idle bluster, not true, thou also"
5646,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],art shutting men's minds against God's fact; thou wilt issue as a cleft
5647,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],crown to some poor man some day; thou also wilt have to take shelter in
5648,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"bogs, whither cavalry cannot follow!' But in Oliver's time, as I say,"
5649,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"there was still belief in the judgments of God; in Oliver's time, there"
5650,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"was yet no distracted jargon of 'abolishing capital punishments,' of"
5651,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"Jean-Jacques philanthropy, and universal rose-water in this world still"
5652,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"so full of sin. Men's notion was, not for abolishing punishments, but"
5653,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"for making laws just. God the Maker's laws, they considered, had not yet"
5654,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],got the punishment abolished from them! Men had a notion that the
5655,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],difference between good and evil was still considerable--equal to the
5656,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"difference between heaven and hell. It was a true notion, which all men"
5657,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"yet saw, and felt, in all fibres of their existence, to be true. Only in"
5658,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"late decadent generations, fast hastening toward radical change or final"
5659,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"perdition, can such indiscriminate mashing up of good and evil into one"
5660,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"universal patent treacle, and most unmedical electuary, of Rousseau"
5661,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"sentimentalism, universal pardon and benevolence, with dinner and drink"
5662,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"and one cheer more, take effect in our earth. Electuary very poisonous,"
5663,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"as sweet as it is, and very nauseous; of which Oliver, happier than we,"
5664,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],had not yet heard the slightest intimation even in dreams.

5669,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"to him solemn on the perilous battle field as voices of God, have become"
5670,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],to us most mournful when spouted as frothy cant from Exeter Hall. The
5671,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"reader has, all along, to make steady allowance for that. And on the"

5674,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"no peace,--such a phenomena as Oliver, in Ireland or elsewhere, is not"
5675,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],the most recognizable in all its meanings. But it waits there for
5676,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"recognition, and can wait an age or two. The memory of Oliver Cromwell,"
5677,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"as I count, has a good many centuries in it yet; and ages of very varied"
5678,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"complexion to apply to, before all end. My reader, in this passage and"

5703,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"understand that he, more than the others, meant any truth or justice to"
5704,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],them. They rejected his summons and terms at Tredah; he stormed the
5705,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"place; and, according to his promise, put every man of the garrison to"
5706,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"death. His own soldiers are forbidden to plunder, by paper proclamation;"

5731,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],barbarous wretches who have imbrued their hands in so much innocent
5732,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],blood; and that it will tend to prevent the effusion of blood for the
5733,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"future. Which are the satisfactory grounds to such actions, which"
5734,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],otherwise cannot but work remorse and regret. * * This hath been an

5736,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],
5737,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],Certainly one not of the rose-water or treacle kind. Mr. Carlyle says
5738,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"such measures ""cut to the heart of the war,"" and brought peace. Was"
5739,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"there _then_ no crying of Peace, Peace, when there was no peace? Ask the"
5740,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],Irish peasantry why they mark that period with the solemn phrase of
5741,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"""Cromwell's Curse!"""
5742,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],
5743,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"For ourselves, though aware of the mistakes and errors in particulars"
5744,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"that must occur, we believe the summing up of a man's character in the"
5745,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"verdict of his time, is likely to be correct. We believe that Cromwell"
5746,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"was ""a curse,"" as much as a blessing, in these acts of his. We believe"
5747,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"him ruthless, ambitious, half a hypocrite, (few men have courage or want"
5748,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"of soul to bear being wholly so,) and we think it is rather too bad to"
5749,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"rave at us in our time for canting, and then hold up the prince of"
5750,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"canters for our reverence in his ""dimly seen nobleness."" Dimly, indeed,"
5751,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],despite the rhetoric and satire of Mr. Carlyle!
5752,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],
5753,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],In previous instances where Mr. Carlyle has acted out his
5754,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"predeterminations as to the study of a character, we have seen"
5755,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"circumstances favor him, at least sometimes. There were fine moments,"
5756,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],fine lights upon the character that he would seize upon. But here the
5757,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],facts look just as they always have. He indeed ascertains that the
5758,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"Cromwell family were not mere brewers or plebeians, but ""substantial"
5759,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"gentry,"" and that there is not the least ground for the common notion"
5760,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],that Cromwell lived at any time a dissolute life. But with the exception
5761,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"of these emendations, still the history looks as of old. We see a man of"
5762,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"strong and wise mind, educated by the pressure of great occasions to"
5763,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],station of command; we see him wearing the religious garb which was the
5764,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"custom of the times, and even preaching to himself as well as to"
5765,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],others--for well can we imagine that his courage and his pride would
5766,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],have fallen without keeping up the illusion; but we never see Heaven
5767,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],answering his invocations in any way that can interfere with the rise of
5768,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"his fortunes or the accomplishment of his plans. To ourselves, the tone"
5769,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],of these religious holdings-forth is sufficiently expressive; they all
5770,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],ring hollow; we have never read any thing of the sort more repulsive to
5771,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"us than the letter to Mr. Hammond, which Mr. Carlyle thinks such a noble"
5772,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"contrast to the impiety of the present time. Indeed, we cannot recover"
5773,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],from our surprise at Mr. Carlyle's liking these letters; his
5774,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"predetermination must have been strong indeed. Again, we see Cromwell"
5775,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"ruling with the strong arm, and carrying the spirit of monarchy to an"
5776,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"excess which no Stuart could surpass. Cromwell, indeed, is wise, and the"
5777,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"king he had punished with death is foolish; Charles is faithless, and"
5778,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"Cromwell crafty; we see no other difference. Cromwell does not, in"
5779,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"power, abide by the principles that led him to it; and we can't help--so"
5780,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"rose-water imbecile are we!--admiring those who do: one Lafayette, for"
5781,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],instance--poor chevalier so despised by Mr. Carlyle--for abiding by his
5782,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"principles, though impracticable, more than Louis Philippe, who laid"
5783,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"them aside, so far as necessary, ""to secure peace to the kingdom;"" and"
5784,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],to us it looks black for one who kills kings to grow to be more kingly
5785,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],than a king.
5786,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],
5787,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"The death of Charles I. was a boon to the world, for it marked the dawn"
5788,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"of a new era, when kings, in common with other men, are to be held"
5789,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],accountable by God and mankind for what they do. Many who took part in
5790,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"this act which _did_ require a courage and faith almost unparalleled,"
5791,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"were, no doubt, moved by the noblest sense of duty. We doubt not this"
5792,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],had its share in the bosom counsels of Cromwell. But we cannot
5793,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],sympathize with the apparent satisfaction of Mr. Carlyle in seeing him
5794,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"engaged, two days after the execution, in marriage treaty for his son."
5795,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],This seems more ruthlessness than calmness. One who devoted so many days
5796,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"to public fasting and prayer, on less occasions, might well make solemn"
5797,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],pause on this. Mr. Carlyle thinks much of some pleasant domestic letters
5798,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"from Cromwell. What brigand, what pirate, fails to have some such soft"
5799,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],and light feelings?
5800,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],
5801,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"In short, we have no time to say all we think; but we stick to the"
5802,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"received notions of Old Noll, with his great, red nose, hard heart, long"
5803,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"head, and crafty ambiguities. Nobody ever doubted his great abilities"
5804,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"and force of will; neither doubt we that he was made an ""instrument"""
5805,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],just as he professeth. But as to looking on him through Mr. Carlyle's
5806,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"glasses, we shall not be sneered or stormed into it, unless he has other"
5807,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],proof to offer than is shown yet. And we resent the violence he offers
5808,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],both to our prejudices and our perceptions. If he has become interested
5809,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"in Oliver, or any other pet hyena, by studying his habits, is that any"
5810,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],reason we should admit him to our Pantheon? No! our imbecility shall
5811,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],keep fast the door against any thing short of proofs that in the hyena a
5812,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"god is incarnated. Mr. Carlyle declares that he sees it, but we really"
5813,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"cannot. The hyena is surely not out of the kingdom of God, but as to"
5814,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"being the finest emblem of what is divine--no, no!"
5815,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],
5816,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"In short, we can sympathize with the words of John Maidstone:--"
5817,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],
5818,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"""He [Cromwell] was a strong man in the dark perils of war; in the high"
5819,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"places of the field, hope shone in him like a pillar of fire, when it"
5820,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"had gone out in the others""--a poetic and sufficient account of the"
5821,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],secret of his power.
5822,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],
5823,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],But Mr. Carlyle goes on to gild the refined gold thus:--
5824,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],
5825,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"""A genuine king among men, Mr. Maidstone! The divinest sight this world"
5826,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"sees, when it is privileged to see such, and not be sickened with the"
5827,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"unholy apery of such."""
5828,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],
5829,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"We know you do with all your soul love kings and heroes, Mr. Carlyle,"
5830,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],but we are not sure you would always know the Sauls from the Davids. We
5831,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"fear, if you had the disposal of the holy oil, you would be tempted to"
5832,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],pour it on the head of him who is taller by the head than all his
5833,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"brethren, without sufficient care as to purity of inward testimony."
5834,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],
5835,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"Such is the impression left on us by the book thus far, as to the view"
5836,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],of its hero; but as to what difficulties attended the writing the
5837,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"history of Cromwell, the reader will like to see what Mr. Carlyle"
5838,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],himself says:--
5839,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],
5840,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"""These authentic utterances of the man Oliver himself--I have gathered"
5841,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],them from far and near; fished them up from the foul Lethean quagmires
5842,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"where they lay buried; I have washed, or endeavored to wash, them clean"
5843,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"from foreign stupidities, (such a job of buck-washing as I do not long"
5844,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"to repeat;) and the world shall now see them in their own shape."""
5845,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],
5846,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"For the rest, this book is of course entertaining, witty, dramatic,"
5847,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"picturesque; all traits that are piquant, many that have profound"
5848,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"interest, are brought out better than new. The ""letters and speeches"""
5849,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"are put into readable state, and this alone is a great benefit. They are"
5850,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],a relief after Mr. Carlyle's high-seasoned writing; and this again is a
5851,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],relief after their long-winded dimnesses. Most of the heroic anecdotes
5852,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"of the time had been used up before, but they lose nothing in the hands"
5853,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"of Carlyle; and pictures of the scenes, such as of Naseby fight, for"
5854,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"instance, it was left to him to give. We have passed over the hackneyed"
5855,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"ground attended by a torch-bearer, who has given a new animation to the"
5856,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"procession of events, and cast a ruddy glow on many a striking"
5857,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"physiognomy. That any truth of high value has been brought to light, we"
5858,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],do not perceive--certainly nothing has been added to our own sense of
5859,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"the greatness of the times, nor any new view presented that we can"
5860,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"adopt, as to the position and character of the agents."
5861,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],
5862,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],We close with the only one of Cromwell's letters that we really like.
5863,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],Here his religious words and his temper seem quite sincere.

5876,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],absolute victory obtained by the Lord's blessing upon the godly
5877,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],party principally. We never charged but we routed the enemy. The
5878,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"left wing, which I commanded, being our own horse, saving a few"
5879,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"Scots in our rear, beat all the prince's horse. God make them as"
5880,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],stubble to our swords. We charged their regiments of foot with our
5881,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"horse, and routed all we charged. The particulars I cannot relate"
5882,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"now; but I believe, of twenty thousand, the prince hath not four"
5883,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"thousand left. Give glory, all the glory, to God."
5884,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],
5885,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"""Sir, God hath taken away your eldest son by a cannon-shot. It"
5886,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"brake his leg. We were necessitated to have it cut off, whereof he"

5892,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"never to know sin or sorrow any more. He was a gallant young man,"
5893,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],exceedingly gracious. God give you his comfort. Before his death he
5894,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"was so full of comfort, that to Frank Russel and myself he could"
5895,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"not express it, 'it was so great above his pain.' This he said to"
5896,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"us. Indeed it was admirable. A little after, he said one thing lay"
5897,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"upon his spirit. I asked him what that was. He told me it was, that"
5898,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],God had not suffered him to be any more the executioner of his
5899,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"enemies. At his fall, his horse being killed with the bullet, and,"
5900,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"as I am informed, three horses more, I am told he bid them open to"
5901,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"the right and left, that he might see the rogues run. Truly he was"
5902,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"exceedingly beloved in the army, of all that knew him. But few knew"
5903,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"him; for he was a precious young man, fit for God. You have cause"
5904,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],to bless the Lord. He is a glorious saint in heaven; wherein you
5905,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],ought exceedingly to rejoice. Let this drink up your sorrow: seeing
5906,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"these are not feigned words to comfort you, but the thing is so"
5907,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],real and undoubted a truth. You may do all things by the strength
5908,OLIVER CROMWELL.[23],"of Christ. Seek that, and you shall easily bear your trial. Let"

5954,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
5955,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
5956,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],At the distance of three years this volume follows the first series of
5957,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"Essays, which have already made to themselves a circle of readers,"
5958,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"attentive, thoughtful, more and more intelligent; and this circle is a"
5959,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"large one if we consider the circumstances of this country, and of"
5960,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"England also, at this time."
5961,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
5962,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],In England it would seem there are a larger number of persons waiting
5963,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],for an invitation to calm thought and sincere intercourse than among
5964,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],ourselves. Copies of Mr. Emerson's first published little volume called
5965,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"""Nature,"" have there been sold by thousands in a short time, while one"
5966,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],edition has needed seven years to get circulated here. Several of his
5967,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"orations and essays from the ""Dial"" have also been republished there,"
5968,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],and met with a reverent and earnest response.
5969,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
5970,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],We suppose that while in England the want of such a voice is as great as
5971,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"here, a larger number are at leisure to recognize that want; a far"
5972,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"larger number have set foot in the speculative region, and have ears"
5973,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],refined to appreciate these melodious accents.
5974,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
5975,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"Our people, heated by a partisan spirit, necessarily occupied in these"
5976,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"first stages by bringing out the material resources of the land, not"
5977,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],generally prepared by early training for the enjoyment of books that
5978,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"require attention and reflection, are still more injured by a large"
5979,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"majority of writers and speakers, who lend all their efforts to flatter"
5980,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"corrupt tastes and mental indolence, instead of feeling it their"
5981,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],prerogative and their duty to admonish the community of the danger and
5982,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],arouse it to nobler energy. The plan of the popular writer or lecturer
5983,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],is not to say the best he knows in as few and well-chosen words as he
5984,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"can, making it his first aim to do justice to the subject. Rather he"
5985,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"seeks to beat out a thought as thin as possible, and to consider what"
5986,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],the audience will be most willing to receive.
5987,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
5988,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],The result of such a course is inevitable. Literature and art must
5989,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],become daily more degraded; philosophy cannot exist. A man who feels
5990,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"within his mind some spark of genius, or a capacity for the exercises of"
5991,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"talent, should consider himself as endowed with a sacred commission. He"
5992,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"is the natural priest, the shepherd of the people. He must raise his"
5993,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"mind as high as he can towards the heaven of truth, and try to draw up"
5994,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],with him those less gifted by nature with ethereal lightness. If he does
5995,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"not so, but rather employs his powers to flatter them in their poverty,"
5996,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"and to hinder aspiration by useless words, and a mere seeming of"
5997,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"activity, his sin is great; he is false to God, and false to man."
5998,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
5999,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],Much of this sin indeed is done ignorantly. The idea that literature
6000,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"calls men to the genuine hierarchy is almost forgotten. One, who finds"
6001,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"himself able, uses his pen, as he might a trowel, solely to procure"
6002,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"himself bread, without having reflected on the position in which he"
6003,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],thereby places himself.
6004,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6005,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"Apart from the troop of mercenaries, there is one, still larger, of"
6006,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"those who use their powers merely for local and temporary ends, aiming"
6007,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],at no excellence other than may conduce to these. Among these rank
6008,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],persons of honor and the best intentions; but they neglect the lasting
6009,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"for the transient, as a man neglects to furnish his mind that he may"
6010,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],provide the better for the house in which his body is to dwell for a few
6011,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],years.
6012,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6013,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"At a period when these sins and errors are prevalent, and threaten to"
6014,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"become more so, how can we sufficiently prize and honor a mind which is"
6015,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"quite pure from such? When, as in the present case, we find a man whose"
6016,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],only aim is the discernment and interpretation of the spiritual laws by
6017,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"which we live, and move, and have our being, all whose objects are"
6018,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"permanent, and whose every word stands for a fact."
6019,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6020,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],If only as a representative of the claims of individual culture in a
6021,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],nation which is prone to lay such stress on artificial organization and
6022,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"external results, Mr. Emerson would be invaluable here. History will"
6023,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"inscribe his name as a father of his country, for he is one who pleads"
6024,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],her cause against herself.
6025,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6026,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],If New England may be regarded as a chief mental focus to the New
6027,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"World,--and many symptoms seem to give her this place,--as to other"
6028,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],centres belong the characteristics of heart and lungs to the body
6029,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"politic; if we may believe, as we do believe, that what is to be acted"
6030,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"out, in the country at large, is, most frequently, first indicated"
6031,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"there, as all the phenomena of the nervous system are in the fantasies"
6032,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"of the brain, we may hail as an auspicious omen the influence Mr."
6033,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"Emerson has there obtained, which is deep-rooted, increasing, and, over"
6034,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"the younger portion of the community, far greater than that of any other"
6035,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],person.
6036,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6037,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],His books are received there with a more ready intelligence than
6038,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"elsewhere, partly because his range of personal experience and"
6039,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],illustration applies to that region; partly because he has prepared the
6040,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],way for his books to be read by his great powers as a speaker.
6041,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6042,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"The audience that waited for years upon the lectures, a part of which is"
6043,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"incorporated into these volumes of Essays, was never large, but it was"
6044,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"select, and it was constant. Among the hearers were some, who, though,"
6045,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"attracted by the beauty of character and manner, they were willing to"
6046,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"hear the speaker through, yet always went away discontented. They were"
6047,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"accustomed to an artificial method, whose scaffolding could easily be"
6048,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"retraced, and desired an obvious sequence of logical inferences. They"
6049,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"insisted there was nothing in what they had heard, because they could"
6050,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],not give a clear account of its course and purport. They did not see
6051,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"that Pindar's odes might be very well arranged for their own purpose,"
6052,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],and yet not bear translating into the methods of Mr. Locke.
6053,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6054,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"Others were content to be benefited by a good influence, without a"
6055,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"strict analysis of its means. ""My wife says it is about the elevation of"
6056,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"human nature, and so it seems to me,"" was a fit reply to some of the"
6057,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],critics. Many were satisfied to find themselves excited to congenial
6058,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"thought and nobler life, without an exact catalogue of the thoughts of"
6059,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],the speaker.
6060,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6061,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"Those who believed no truth could exist, unless encased by the burrs of"
6062,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"opinion, went away utterly baffled. Sometimes they thought he was on"
6063,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],their side; then presently would come something on the other. He really
6064,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"seemed to believe there were two sides to every subject, and even to"
6065,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"intimate higher ground, from which each might be seen to have an"
6066,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"infinite number of sides or bearings, an impertinence not to be endured!"
6067,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"The partisan heard but once, and returned no more."
6068,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6069,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"But some there were,--simple souls,--whose life had been, perhaps,"
6070,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"without clear light, yet still a-search after truth for its own sake,"
6071,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],who were able to receive what followed on the suggestion of a subject in
6072,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"a natural manner, as a stream of thought. These recognized, beneath the"
6073,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"veil of words, the still small voice of conscience, the vestal fires of"
6074,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"lone religious hours, and the mild teachings of the summer woods."
6075,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6076,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"The charm of the elocution, too, was great. His general manner was that"
6077,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"of the reader, occasionally rising into direct address or invocation in"
6078,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],passages where tenderness or majesty demanded more energy. At such times
6079,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"both eye and voice called on a remote future to give a worthy reply,--a"
6080,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],future which shall manifest more largely the universal soul as it was
6081,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"then manifest to this soul. The tone of the voice was a grave body tone,"
6082,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"full and sweet rather than sonorous, yet flexible, and haunted by many"
6083,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"modulations, as even instruments of wood and brass seem to become after"
6084,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],they have been long played on with skill and taste; how much more so the
6085,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],human voice! In the more expressive passages it uttered notes of
6086,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"silvery clearness, winning, yet still more commanding. The words uttered"
6087,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"in those tones floated a while above us, then took root in the memory"
6088,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],like winged seed.
6089,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6090,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"In the union of an even rustic plainness with lyric inspirations,"
6091,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"religious dignity with philosophic calmness, keen sagacity in details"
6092,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"with boldness of view, we saw what brought to mind the early poets and"
6093,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],legislators of Greece--men who taught their fellows to plough and avoid
6094,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"moral evil, sing hymns to the gods, and watch the metamorphoses of"
6095,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],nature. Here in civic Boston was such a man--one who could see man in
6096,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"his original grandeur and his original childishness, rooted in simple"
6097,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"nature, raising to the heavens the brow and eyes of a poet."
6098,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6099,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"And these lectures seemed not so much lectures as grave didactic poems,"
6100,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"theogonies, perhaps, adorned by odes when some power was in question"
6101,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"whom the poet had best learned to serve, and with eclogues wisely"
6102,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"portraying in familiar tongue the duties of man to man and ""harmless"
6103,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"animals."""
6104,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6105,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],Such was the attitude in which the speaker appeared to that portion of
6106,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],the audience who have remained permanently attached to him. They value
6107,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],his words as the signets of reality; receive his influence as a help and
6108,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"incentive to a nobler discipline than the age, in its general aspect,"
6109,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],appears to require; and do not fear to anticipate the verdict of
6110,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"posterity in claiming for him the honors of greatness, and, in some"
6111,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"respects, of a master."
6112,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6113,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],In New England Mr. Emerson thus formed for himself a class of readers
6114,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"who rejoice to study in his books what they already know by heart. For,"
6115,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"though the thought has become familiar, its beautiful garb is always"
6116,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],fresh and bright in hue.
6117,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6118,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"A similar circle of ""like-minded"" persons the books must and do form for"
6119,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"themselves, though with a movement less directly powerful, as more"
6120,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],distant from its source.
6121,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6122,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],The Essays have also been obnoxious to many charges; to that of
6123,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"obscurity, or want of perfect articulation; of ""euphuism,"" as an excess"
6124,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"of fancy in proportion to imagination; and an inclination, at times, to"
6125,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"subtlety at the expense of strength, have been styled. The human heart"
6126,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"complains of inadequacy, either in the nature or experience of the"
6127,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"writer, to represent its full vocation and its deeper needs. Sometimes"
6128,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"it speaks of this want as ""under development,"" or a want of expansion"
6129,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"which may yet be remedied; sometimes doubts whether ""in this mansion"
6130,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"there be either hall or portal to receive the loftier of the passions."""
6131,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"Sometimes the soul is deified at the expense of nature, then again"
6132,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],nature at that of man; and we are not quite sure that we can make a true
6133,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],harmony by balance of the statements. This writer has never written one
6134,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"good work, if such a work be one where the whole commands more attention"
6135,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"than the parts, or if such a one be produced only where, after an"
6136,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"accumulation of materials, fire enough be applied to fuse the whole into"
6137,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],one new substance. This second series is superior in this respect to the
6138,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],former; yet in no one essay is the main stress so obvious as to produce
6139,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],on the mind the harmonious effect of a noble river or a tree in full
6140,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],leaf. Single passages and sentences engage our attention too much in
6141,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"proportion. These Essays, it has been justly said, tire like a string of"
6142,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],mosaics or a house built of medals. We miss what we expect in the work
6143,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"of the great poet, or the great philosopher--the liberal air of all the"
6144,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"zones; the glow, uniform yet various in tint, which is given to a body"
6145,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],by free circulation of the heart's blood from the hour of birth. Here
6146,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"is, undoubtedly, the man of ideas; but we want the ideal man also--want"
6147,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],the heart and genius of human life to interpret it; and here our
6148,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],satisfaction is not so perfect. We doubt this friend raised himself too
6149,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"early to the perpendicular, and did not lie along the ground long enough"
6150,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],to hear the secret whispers of our parent life. We could wish he might
6151,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"be thrown by conflicts on the lap of mother earth, to see if he would"
6152,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],not rise again with added powers.
6153,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6154,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"All this we may say, but it cannot excuse us from benefiting by the"
6155,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"great gifts that have been given, and assigning them their due place."
6156,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6157,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],Some painters paint on a red ground. And this color may be supposed to
6158,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"represent the groundwork most immediately congenial to most men, as it"
6159,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"is the color of blood, and represents human vitality. The figures traced"
6160,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],upon it are instinct with life in its fulness and depth.
6161,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6162,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"But other painters paint on a gold ground. And a very different, but no"
6163,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"less natural, because also a celestial beauty, is given to their works"
6164,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"who choose for their foundation the color of the sunbeam, which Nature"
6165,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"has preferred for her most precious product, and that which will best"
6166,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],bear the test of purification--gold.
6167,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6168,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"If another simile may be allowed, another no less apt is at hand. Wine"
6169,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],is the most brilliant and intense expression of the powers of earth. It
6170,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"is her potable fire, her answer to the sun. It exhilarates, it inspires,"
6171,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"but then it is liable to fever and intoxicate, too, the careless"
6172,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],partaker.
6173,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6174,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],Mead was the chosen drink of the northern gods. And this essence of the
6175,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],honey of the mountain bee was not thought unworthy to revive the souls
6176,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],of the valiant who had left their bodies on the fields of strife below.
6177,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6178,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"Nectar should combine the virtues of the ruby wine, the golden mead,"
6179,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],without their defects or dangers.
6180,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6181,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],Two high claims on the attention of his contemporaries our writer can
6182,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],vindicate. One from his sincerity. You have his thought just as it found
6183,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"place in the life of his own soul. Thus, however near or relatively"
6184,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"distant its approximation to absolute truth, its action on you cannot"
6185,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],fail to be healthful. It is a part of the free air.
6186,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6187,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],Emerson belongs to that band of whom there may be found a few in every
6188,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"age, and who now in known human history may be counted by hundreds, who"
6189,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"worship the one God only, the God of Truth. They worship, not saints,"
6190,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"nor creeds, nor churches, nor reliques, nor idols in any form. The mind"
6191,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"is kept open to truth, and life only valued as a tendency towards it."
6192,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"This must be illustrated by acts and words of love, purity and"
6193,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],intelligence. Such are the salt of the earth; let the minutest crystal
6194,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],of that salt be willingly by us held in solution.
6195,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6196,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"The other claim is derived from that part of his life, which, if"
6197,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"sometimes obstructed or chilled by the critical intellect, is yet the"
6198,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],prevalent and the main source of his power. It is that by which he
6199,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"imprisons his hearer only to free him again as a ""liberating God,"" (to"
6200,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"use his own words.) But, indeed, let us use them altogether, for none"
6201,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"other, ancient or modern, can more worthily express how, making present"
6202,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"to us the courses and destinies of nature, he invests himself with her"
6203,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],serenity and animates us with her joy.
6204,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6205,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"""Poetry was all written before time was; and whenever we are so finely"
6206,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"organized that we can penetrate into that region where the air is music,"
6207,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"we hear those primal warblings, and attempt to write them down, but we"
6208,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"lose ever and anon a word or a verse, and substitute something of our"
6209,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"own, and thus miswrite the poem. The men of more delicate ear write down"
6210,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"these cadences more faithfully, and these transcripts, though imperfect,"
6211,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"become the songs of the nations."""
6212,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],
6213,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"Thus have we, in a brief and unworthy manner, indicated some views of"
6214,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],these books. The only true criticism of these or any good books may be
6215,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],gained by making them the companions of our lives. Does every accession
6216,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],of knowledge or a juster sense of beauty make us prize them more? Then
6217,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],"they are good, indeed, and more immortal than mortal. Let that test be"
6218,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],applied to these Essays which will lead to great and complete
6219,EMERSON'S ESSAYS[26],poems--somewhere.

6225,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],
6226,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],
6227,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"We have had this book before us for several weeks, but the task of"
6228,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],reading it has been so repulsive that we have been obliged to get
6229,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"through it by short stages, with long intervals of rest and refreshment"
6230,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"between, and have only just reached the end. We believe, however, we are"
6231,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"now possessed of its substance, so far as it is possible to admit into"
6232,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"any mind matter wholly uncongenial with its structure, its faith, and"
6233,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],its hope.
6234,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],
6235,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"Meanwhile others have shown themselves more energetic in the task, and"
6236,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"notices have appeared that express, in part, our own views. Among others"
6237,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],an able critic has thus summed up his impressions:--
6238,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],
6239,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"""Of the whole we will say briefly, that its premises are monstrous, its"
6240,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"reasoning sophistical, its conclusions absurd, and its spirit diabolic."""
6241,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],
6242,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],We know not that we can find a better scheme of arrangement for what we
6243,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],have to say than by dividing it into sections under these four heads:--
6244,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],
6245,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"1st. The premises are monstrous. Here we must add the qualification,"
6246,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],they are monstrous _to us_. The God of these writers is not the God we
6247,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],recognize; the views they have of human nature are antipodal to ours. We
6248,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"believe in a Creative Spirit, the essense of whose being is Love. He has"
6249,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"created men in the spirit of love, intending to develop them to perfect"
6250,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],harmony with himself. He has permitted the temporary existence of evil
6251,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],as a condition necessary to bring out in them free agency and
6252,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],individuality of character. Punishment is the necessary result of a bad
6253,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"choice in them; it is not meant by him as vengeance, but as an"
6254,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],admonition to choose better. Man is not born totally evil; he is born
6255,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"capable both of good and evil, and the Holy Spirit in working on him"
6256,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],only quickens the soul already there to know its Father. To one who
6257,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"takes such views the address of Jesus becomes intelligible--""Be ye"
6258,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful."" ""For with the same"
6259,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"measure that ye mete withal, it shall be measured to you again."""
6260,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],
6261,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],Those who take these views of the relation between God and man must
6262,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],naturally tend to have punishment consist as much as possible in the
6263,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"inward spiritual results of faults, rather than a violent outward"
6264,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"enforcement of penalty. They must, so far as possible, seek to revere"
6265,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],God by showing themselves brotherly to man; and if they wish to obey
6266,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"Christ, will not forget that he came especially to call _sinners_ to"
6267,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],repentance.
6268,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],
6269,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],The views of these writers are the opposite of all this. We need not
6270,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],state them; they are sufficiently indicated in each page of their own.
6271,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],Their conclusions are the natural result of such premises. We could say
6272,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"nothing about either, except to express dissent from beginning to end."
6273,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"Yet would it be sweet and noble, and worthy of this late period of human"
6274,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"progress, if their position had been stated in a spirit of religious, of"

6278,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],have arisen in vain. The object of every such manifestation of life must
6279,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"be to bring out truth; come, let us seek it together. Let us show you"
6280,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"our view, compare it with yours, and let us see which is the better. If,"

6284,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"Of this degree of liberality we have known some, even, who served the"
6285,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"same creed as these writers to be capable. There is, indeed, a higher"
6286,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"spirit, which, believing all forms of opinion which we hold in the"
6287,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"present stage of our growth can be but approximations to truth, and that"
6288,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],God has permitted to the multitude of men a multitude of ways by which
6289,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"they may approach one common goal, looks with reverence on all modes of"
6290,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"faith sincerely held and acted upon, and while it rejoices in those"
6291,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"souls which have reached the higher stages of spiritual growth, has no"
6292,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],despair as to those which still grope in a narrow path and by a
6293,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"glimmering light. Such liberality is, of course, out of the question"
6294,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],with such writers as the present. Their faith binds them to believe that
6295,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"they have absolute truth, and that all who do not believe as they do are"
6296,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],wretched heretics. Those whose creed is of narrower scope are to them
6297,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],hateful bigots; but also those with whom it is of wider are
6298,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],latitudinarians or infidels. The spot of earth on which they stand is
6299,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"the only one safe from the conflagration, and only through spectacles"
6300,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],and spyglasses such as are used by them can the sun and stars be seen.
6301,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"Yet, as we said before, some such, though incapacitated for an"
6302,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"intellectual, are not so for a spiritual tolerance. With them the heart,"
6303,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"more Christ-like than the creed, urges to a spirit of love and reverence"
6304,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],even towards convictions opposed to their own. The sincere man is always
6305,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"respectable in their eyes, and they cannot help feeling that, wherever"
6306,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"there is a desire for truth, there is the spirit of God, and his true"
6307,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"priests will approach with gentleness, and do their ministry with holy"
6308,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"care. Unhappily, it is very different with the persons before us."
6309,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],
6310,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"We let go the first two counts of the indictment. Their premises are, as"
6311,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"we have said, such as we totally dissent from, and their conclusions"
6312,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],such as naturally flow from those premises. Yet they are those of a
6313,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"large body of men, and there must, no doubt, be temporary good in this"
6314,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"state of things, or it would not be permitted. When these writers say,"
6315,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"that to them moral and penal are coincident terms, they display a state"
6316,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"of mind which prefers basing virtue on the fear of punishment, rather"
6317,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"than the love of right. If this be sincerely their state, if the idea of"
6318,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"morality is with them entirely dependent on the retributions upon vice,"
6319,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"rather than the loveliness and joys of goodness, it is impossible for"
6320,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],those who are in a different state of mind to say what they _do_ need.
6321,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"It may seem to us, indeed, that, if the strait jacket was taken off,"
6322,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"they might recover the natural energy of their frames, and do far better"
6323,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"without it; or that, if no longer hurried along the road by the"
6324,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"impending lash behind, they might uplift their eyes, and find sufficient"
6325,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"cause for speed in the glory visible before, though at a distance;"
6326,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"however, it is not for us to say what their wants are. Let them choose"
6327,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"their own principles of action, and if they lead to purity of life, and"
6328,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"benevolence, and humanity of heart, we will not say a word against them."
6329,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],
6330,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"But in the instance before us, they do not produce these good fruits,"
6331,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],but the contrary; and therefore we have something to say on the other
6332,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"part of the criticism, to wit: that ""the reasoning is sophistical, and"
6333,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"the spirit diabolic;"" for, indeed, in the sense of pride by which the"
6334,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"angels fell, arrogance of judgment, malice, and all uncharitableness, we"
6335,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],have never looked on printed pages more deeply sinful. We love an honest
6336,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"lover; but next best, we, with Dr. Johnson, know how to respect an"
6337,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],honest hater. But even he would scarce endure so bitter and ardent
6338,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"haters as these, and with so many and inconsistent objects of"
6339,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"hatred--who hate Catholics and thorough Protestants, hate materialists,"
6340,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],and hate spiritualists. Their list is really too large for _human_
6341,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],sympathy.
6342,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],
6343,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"We wish, however, to make all due allowance for incapacity in these"
6344,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"writers to do better; and their disqualifications for their task, apart"
6345,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"from a form of belief which inclines them rather to cling to the past,"
6346,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"than to seek progress for the future, seem to be many."
6347,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],
6348,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"The ""reasoning is sophistical,"" and it would need the patience of a"
6349,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"Socrates to unravel the weary web, and convince these sophists, against"
6350,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"their will, that they are exactly in the opposite region to what they"
6351,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"suppose. For the task we have not space, skill, or patience; but we can"
6352,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],give some hints by which readers may be led to examine whether it is so
6353,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],or not.
6354,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],
6355,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],These writers profess to occupy the position of defence; surely never
6356,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],was one sustained so in the spirit of offence.
6357,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],
6358,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"1st. They appeal either to the natural or regenerate man, as suits their"
6359,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],purpose. Sometimes all traditions and their literal interpretations are
6360,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"right; sometimes it is impossible to interpret them aright, unless"
6361,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"according to some peculiar doctrine, and the natural inference of the"
6362,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],common mind would be an error.
6363,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],
6364,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"2d. They strain, but vainly, to show the New Testament no improvement on"
6365,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"the Old, and themselves in harmonious relations to both. On this subject"
6366,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],we would confidently leave the arbitration to a mind--could such a one

6369,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"been, whether its views are not of the same strain that Jesus sought to"
6370,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"correct and enlighten among the Jews, and whether the writers do not"
6371,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"treat the teachings of the new dispensation most unfairly, in their"
6372,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],desire to wrest them into the service of the old.
6373,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],
6374,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"3d. Wherever there is a weak place in the argument, it is filled up by"

6376,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"""blasphemous,"" ""shallow philosophy,"" ""sickly sentimentalism,"" and the"
6377,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"like, are among the favorite missiles of these _defenders_ of the truth."
6378,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],They are of a sort whose frequent use is generally supposed to argue the
6379,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],want of a shield of reason and a heart of faith.
6380,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],
6381,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],And this brings us to a more close consideration of the spirit of this
6382,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"book, characterized by our contemporary as ""diabolic."" And we, also,"
6383,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"cannot excuse ourselves from marking it as, in this respect, one of the"
6384,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],worst books we have ever seen.
6385,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],
6386,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"It is not merely bitter intolerance, arrogance, and want of spiritual"
6387,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"perception, which we have to condemn in these writers. It is a want of"
6388,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"fairness and honor, of which we think they must be conscious. We fear"
6389,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],they are of those who hold the opinion that the end sanctifies the
6390,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"means, and who, by pretending to serve the God of truth by other means"
6391,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"than strict truth, have drawn upon the ""ministers of religion"" the"
6392,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"frequent obloquy of ""priestcraft."" How else are we to construe the"
6393,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"artful use of the words ""dishonest"" and ""infidel,"" wherever they are"
6394,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],likely to awaken the fears and prejudices of the ignorant?

6401,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],

6404,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],
6405,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"""Indeed, there is nothing that can possibly check the spirit of murder,"
6406,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"but the fear of death. That was all that Cain feared; he did not say,"
6407,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"People will put me in prison, but, They will put me to death; _and how"

6412,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"God of mistake, as he says his opponents accuse Him, whenever they"
6413,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],attempt to get beyond the Jewish ideas of vengeance. He plainly thinks
6414,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],death was the only safe penalty in this case of Cain.
6415,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],
6416,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"""The reasoning from these drivellings of depravity in malefactors is to"
6417,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],the last degree wretched and absurd. Hard pushed indeed must he be in

6419,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"Newgate criminal, in order to fish up, from the confessions of his"

6423,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"We can only wish for such a man, that the vicissitudes of life may break"
6424,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"through the crust of theological arrogance and Phariseeism, and force"
6425,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"him to ""dive down"" into the depths of his own nature. We should see"
6426,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],afterwards whether he would be so forward to throw stones at
6427,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"malefactors, so eager to hurry souls to what he regards as a final"
6428,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],account.
6429,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],
6430,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],But we have said enough as to the spirit and tendency of this book. We
6431,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"shall only add a few words as to the unworthy use of the word ""infidel,"""
6432,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],in the attempt to fix a stigma upon opponents. We feel still more
6433,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],contempt than indignation at the desire to work in this way on the
6434,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],unthinking and ignorant.
6435,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],
6436,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],We ourselves are of the number stigmatized by these persons as sharing
6437,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"an infidel tendency, as are all not enlisted under their own sectarian"
6438,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"banner. They, on their side, seem to us unbelievers in all that is most"
6439,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"pure and holy, and in the saving grace of love. They do not believe in"
6440,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"God, as we believe; they seem to us utterly deficient in the spirit of"
6441,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"Christ, and to be of the number of those who are always calling, ""Lord,"
6442,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"Lord,"" yet never have known him. We find throughout these pages the"
6443,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"temper of ""Lord, I thank thee that I am not as other men are""--hatred of"
6444,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"those whom they deem Gentiles, and a merciless spirit towards the"
6445,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],sinner; yet we do not take upon ourselves to give them the name of
6446,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"infidels, and we solemnly call them to trial before the bar of the Only"
6447,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"Wise and Pure, the Searcher of hearts, to render an account of this"

6449,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"class threatened with ""retribution"" for saying to their brother, ""Thou"
6450,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"fool;"" and that not merely in the heat of anger, but coolly,"
6451,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"pertinaciously, and in a thousand ways."

6453,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"We call to sit in council the spirits of our Puritan fathers, and ask if"
6454,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"such was the right of individual judgment, of private conscience, they"
6455,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],came here to vindicate. And we solicit the verdict of posterity as to
6456,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"whether the spirit of mercy or of vengeance be the more divine, and"
6457,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],whether the denunciatory and personal mode chosen by these writers for
6458,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],carrying on this inquiry be the true one.
6459,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],
6460,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],We wish most sincerely this book had been a wise and noble one. To
6461,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"ascertain just principles, it is necessary that the discussion should be"
6462,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"full and fair, and both sides ably argued. After this has been done, the"
6463,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],sense of the world can decide. It would be a happiness for which it
6464,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"might seem that man at this time of day is ripe, that the opposing"
6465,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"parties should meet in open lists as brothers, believing each that the"
6466,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"other desired only that the truth should triumph, and able to clasp"
6467,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"hands as men of different structure and ways of thinking, but"
6468,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"fellow-students of the divine will. O, had we but found such an"
6469,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"adversary, above the use of artful abuse, or the feints of sophistry,"
6470,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"able to believe in the noble intention, of a foe as of a friend, how"
6471,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],cheerily would the trumpets ring out while the assembled world echoed
6472,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"the signal words, ""GOD SPEED THE RIGHT!"" The tide of progress rolls"
6473,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"onward, swelling more and more with the lives of those who would fain"
6474,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.[27],"see all men called to repentance. It must be a strong arm, indeed, that"

6496,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6497,FIRST OF JANUARY,For why so much congratulation? A year has passed; we are nearer by a

6581,FIRST OF JANUARY,"all human beings, and among others for thyself."
6582,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6583,FIRST OF JANUARY,"We have seen many fair poesies of human life, in which, however, the"
6584,FIRST OF JANUARY,tragic thread has not been wanting. We have beheld the exquisite
6585,FIRST OF JANUARY,"developments of childhood, and sunned the heart in its smiles. But also"
6586,FIRST OF JANUARY,have we discerned the evil star looming up that threatened cloud and
6587,FIRST OF JANUARY,wreck to its future years. We have seen beings of some precious gifts
6588,FIRST OF JANUARY,"lost irrecoverably, as regards this present life, from inheritance of a"
6589,FIRST OF JANUARY,bad organization and unfortunate circumstances of early years. The
6590,FIRST OF JANUARY,"victims of vice we have observed lying in the gutter, companied by"
6591,FIRST OF JANUARY,"vermin, trampled upon by sensuality and ignorance, and saw those who"
6592,FIRST OF JANUARY,"wished not to rise, and those who strove so to do, but fell back through"
6593,FIRST OF JANUARY,"weakness. Sadder and more ominous still, we have seen the good man--in"
6594,FIRST OF JANUARY,"many impulses and acts of most pure, most liberal, and undoubted"
6595,FIRST OF JANUARY,"goodness--yet have we noted a spot of base indulgence, a fibre of"
6596,FIRST OF JANUARY,"brutality canker in a vital part this fine plant, and, while we could"
6597,FIRST OF JANUARY,"not withdraw love and esteem for the good we could not doubt, have wept"
6598,FIRST OF JANUARY,secretly in the heart for the ill we could not deny. We have observed
6599,FIRST OF JANUARY,"two deaths; one of the sinner, early cut down; one of the just, full of"
6600,FIRST OF JANUARY,years and honor--_both_ were calm; both professed their reliance on the
6601,FIRST OF JANUARY,wisdom of a heavenly Father. We have looked upon the beauteous shows of
6602,FIRST OF JANUARY,"nature in undisturbed succession, holy moonlight on the snows, loving"
6603,FIRST OF JANUARY,"moonlight on the summer fields, the stars which disappoint never and"
6604,FIRST OF JANUARY,"bless ever, the flowing waters which soothe and stimulate, a garden of"
6605,FIRST OF JANUARY,"roses calling for queens among women, poets and heroes among men. We"
6606,FIRST OF JANUARY,"have marked a desire to answer to this call, and genius brought rich"
6607,FIRST OF JANUARY,"wine, but spilt it on the way, from her careless, fickle gait; and"
6608,FIRST OF JANUARY,"virtue tainted with a touch of the peacock; and philosophy, never"
6609,FIRST OF JANUARY,"enjoying, always seeking, had got together all the materials for the"
6610,FIRST OF JANUARY,"crowning experiment, but there was no love to kindle the fire under the"
6611,FIRST OF JANUARY,"furnace, and the precious secret is not precipitated yet, for the pot"
6612,FIRST OF JANUARY,will not boil to make the gold through your
6613,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6614,FIRST OF JANUARY,"""Double, double,"
6615,FIRST OF JANUARY,"Toil and trouble,"""
6616,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6617,FIRST OF JANUARY,if love do not fan the fire.
6618,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6619,FIRST OF JANUARY,We have seen the decay of friendships unable to endure the light of an
6620,FIRST OF JANUARY,"ideal hope--have seen, too, their resurrection in a faith and hope"
6621,FIRST OF JANUARY,"beyond the tomb, where the form lies we once so fondly cherished. It is"
6622,FIRST OF JANUARY,"not dead, but sleepeth; and we watch, but must weep, too, sometimes, for"
6623,FIRST OF JANUARY,the night is cold and lonely in the place of tombs.
6624,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6625,FIRST OF JANUARY,Nature has appeared dressed in her veil of snowy flowers for the bridal.
6626,FIRST OF JANUARY,"We have seen her brooding over her joys, a young mother in the pride and"
6627,FIRST OF JANUARY,"fulness of beauty, and then bearing her offspring to their richly"
6628,FIRST OF JANUARY,"ornamented sepulchre, and lately observed her as if kneeling with folded"
6629,FIRST OF JANUARY,"hands in the stillness of prayer, while the bare trees and frozen"
6630,FIRST OF JANUARY,streams bore witness to her patience.
6631,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6632,FIRST OF JANUARY,"O, much, much have we seen, and a little learned. Such is the record of"
6633,FIRST OF JANUARY,"the private mind; and yet, as the bright snake-skin is cast, many sigh"
6634,FIRST OF JANUARY,"and cry,--"
6635,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6636,FIRST OF JANUARY,"""The wiser mind"
6637,FIRST OF JANUARY,Mourns less for what Time takes away
6638,FIRST OF JANUARY,"Than what he leaves behind."""
6639,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6640,FIRST OF JANUARY,"But for ourselves, we find there is kernel in the nut, though its"
6641,FIRST OF JANUARY,"ripening be deferred till the late frosty weather, and it prove a hard"
6642,FIRST OF JANUARY,"nut to crack even then. Looking at the individual, we see a degree of"
6643,FIRST OF JANUARY,"growth, or the promise of such. In the child there is a force which will"
6644,FIRST OF JANUARY,"outlast the wreck, and reach at last the promised shore. The good man,"
6645,FIRST OF JANUARY,"once roused from his moral lethargy, shall make atonement for his fault,"
6646,FIRST OF JANUARY,and endure a penance that will deepen and purify his whole nature. The
6647,FIRST OF JANUARY,"poor lost ones claim a new trial in a new life, and will there, we"
6648,FIRST OF JANUARY,"trust, seize firmer hold on the good for the experience they have had of"
6649,FIRST OF JANUARY,the bad.
6650,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6651,FIRST OF JANUARY,"""We never see the stars"
6652,FIRST OF JANUARY,"Till we can see nought else."""
6653,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6654,FIRST OF JANUARY,"The seeming losses are, in truth, but as pruning of the vine to make the"
6655,FIRST OF JANUARY,grapes swell more richly.
6656,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6657,FIRST OF JANUARY,"But how is it with those larger individuals, the nations, and that"
6658,FIRST OF JANUARY,"congress of such, the world? We must take a broad and superficial view"
6659,FIRST OF JANUARY,"of these, as we have of private life; and in neither case can more be"
6660,FIRST OF JANUARY,"done. The secrets of the confessional, or rather of the shrine, do not"
6661,FIRST OF JANUARY,"come on paper, unless in poetic form."
6662,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6663,FIRST OF JANUARY,"So we will not try to search and mine, but only to look over the world"
6664,FIRST OF JANUARY,from an ideal point of view.
6665,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6666,FIRST OF JANUARY,Here we find the same phenomena repeated; the good nation is yet somehow
6667,FIRST OF JANUARY,so sick at heart that you are not sure its goodness will ever produce a
6668,FIRST OF JANUARY,"harmony of life; over the young nation, (our own,) rich in energy and"
6669,FIRST OF JANUARY,"full of glee, brood terrible omens; others, as Poland and Italy, seem"
6670,FIRST OF JANUARY,"irrecoverably lost. They may revive, but we feel as if it must be under"
6671,FIRST OF JANUARY,new forms.
6672,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6673,FIRST OF JANUARY,"Forms come and go, but principles are developed and displayed more and"
6674,FIRST OF JANUARY,"more. The caldron simmers, and so great is the fire that we expect it"
6675,FIRST OF JANUARY,"soon to boil over, and new fates appear for Europe."
6676,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6677,FIRST OF JANUARY,Spain is dying by inches; England shows symptoms of having passed her
6678,FIRST OF JANUARY,"meridian; Austria has taken opium, but she must awake ere long; France"
6679,FIRST OF JANUARY,"is in an uneasy dream--she knows she has been very sick, has had"
6680,FIRST OF JANUARY,"terrible remedies administered, and ought to be getting thoroughly well,"
6681,FIRST OF JANUARY,"which she is not. Louis Philippe watches by her pillow, doses and"
6682,FIRST OF JANUARY,"bleeds her, so that she cannot fairly try her strength, and find whether"
6683,FIRST OF JANUARY,something or nothing has been done. But Louis Philippe and Metternich
6684,FIRST OF JANUARY,"must soon, in the course of nature, leave this scene; and then there"
6685,FIRST OF JANUARY,"will be none to keep out air and light from the chamber, and the"
6686,FIRST OF JANUARY,patients will be roused and ascertain their true condition.
6687,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6688,FIRST OF JANUARY,No power is in the ascending course except the Russian; and that has
6689,FIRST OF JANUARY,"such a condensation of brute force, animated by despotic will, that it"
6690,FIRST OF JANUARY,seems sometimes as if it might by and by stride over Europe and face us
6691,FIRST OF JANUARY,across the water. Then would be opposed to one another the two extremes
6692,FIRST OF JANUARY,"of Autocracy and Democracy, and a trial of strength would ensue between"
6693,FIRST OF JANUARY,the two principles more grand and full than any ever seen on this
6694,FIRST OF JANUARY,"planet, and of which the result must be to bind mankind by one chain of"
6695,FIRST OF JANUARY,"convictions. Should, indeed, Despotism and Democracy meet as the two"
6696,FIRST OF JANUARY,"slaveholding powers of the world, the result can hardly be predicted."
6697,FIRST OF JANUARY,"But there is room in the intervening age for many changes, and the czars"
6698,FIRST OF JANUARY,"profess to wish to free their serfs, as our planters do to free their"
6699,FIRST OF JANUARY,"slaves, and we suppose with equal sincerity; but the need of sometimes"
6700,FIRST OF JANUARY,professing such desires is a deference to the progress of principles
6701,FIRST OF JANUARY,which bid fair to have their era yet.
6702,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6703,FIRST OF JANUARY,"We hope such an era steadfastly, notwithstanding the deeds of darkness"
6704,FIRST OF JANUARY,that have made this year forever memorable in our annals. Our nation has
6705,FIRST OF JANUARY,indeed shown that the lust of gain is at present her ruling passion. She
6706,FIRST OF JANUARY,"is not only resolute, but shameless, about it, and has no doubt or"
6707,FIRST OF JANUARY,"scruple as to laying aside the glorious office, assigned her by fate, of"
6708,FIRST OF JANUARY,"herald of freedom, light, and peace to the civilized world."
6709,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6710,FIRST OF JANUARY,"Yet we must not despair. Even so the Jewish king, crowned with all gifts"
6711,FIRST OF JANUARY,"that Heaven could bestow, was intoxicated by their plenitude, and went"
6712,FIRST OF JANUARY,astray after the most worthless idols. But he was not permitted to
6713,FIRST OF JANUARY,forfeit finally the position designed for him: he was drawn or dragged
6714,FIRST OF JANUARY,back to it; and so shall it be with this nation. There are trials in
6715,FIRST OF JANUARY,store which shall amend us.
6716,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6717,FIRST OF JANUARY,We must believe that the pure blood shown in the time of our revolution
6718,FIRST OF JANUARY,still glows in the heart; but the body of our nation is full of foreign
6719,FIRST OF JANUARY,"elements. A large proportion of our citizens, or their parents, came"
6720,FIRST OF JANUARY,"here for worldly advantage, and have never raised their minds to any"
6721,FIRST OF JANUARY,idea of destiny or duty. More money--more land! are all the watchwords
6722,FIRST OF JANUARY,they know. They have received the inheritance earned by the fathers of
6723,FIRST OF JANUARY,"the revolution, without their wisdom and virtue to use it. But this"
6724,FIRST OF JANUARY,"cannot last. The vision of those prophetic souls must be realized, else"
6725,FIRST OF JANUARY,"the nation could not exist; every body must at least ""have soul enough"
6726,FIRST OF JANUARY,"to save the expense of salt,"" or it cannot be preserved alive."
6727,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6728,FIRST OF JANUARY,"What a year it has been with us! Texas annexed, and more annexations in"
6729,FIRST OF JANUARY,"store; slavery perpetuated, as the most striking new feature of these"
6730,FIRST OF JANUARY,movements. Such are the fruits of American love of liberty! Mormons
6731,FIRST OF JANUARY,"murdered and driven out, as an expression of American freedom of"
6732,FIRST OF JANUARY,conscience; Cassius Clay's paper expelled from Kentucky; that is
6733,FIRST OF JANUARY,American freedom of the press. And all these deeds defended on the true
6734,FIRST OF JANUARY,"Russian grounds, ""We (the stronger) know what you (the weaker) ought to"
6735,FIRST OF JANUARY,"do and be, and it _shall_ be so."""
6736,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6737,FIRST OF JANUARY,"Thus the principles which it was supposed, some ten years back, had"
6738,FIRST OF JANUARY,"begun to regenerate the world, are left without a trophy for this past"
6739,FIRST OF JANUARY,"year, except in the spread of Rongé's movement in Germany, and that of"
6740,FIRST OF JANUARY,"associative and communist principles both here and in Europe, which, let"
6741,FIRST OF JANUARY,"the worldling deem as he will about their practicability, he cannot deny"
6742,FIRST OF JANUARY,to be animated by faith in God and a desire for the good of man. We must
6743,FIRST OF JANUARY,add to these the important symptoms of the spread of peace principles.
6744,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6745,FIRST OF JANUARY,"Meanwhile, if the more valuable springs of action seem to lie dormant"
6746,FIRST OF JANUARY,"for a time, there is a constant invention and perfection of the means of"
6747,FIRST OF JANUARY,"action and communication which seems to say, ""Do but wait patiently;"
6748,FIRST OF JANUARY,"there is something of universal importance to be done by and by, and all"
6749,FIRST OF JANUARY,"is preparing for it to be universally known and used at once."" Else what"
6750,FIRST OF JANUARY,"avail magnetic telegraphs, steamers, and rail-cars traversing every rood"
6751,FIRST OF JANUARY,"of land and ocean, phonography and the mingling of all literatures, till"
6752,FIRST OF JANUARY,North embraces South and Denmark lays her head upon the lap of Italy?
6753,FIRST OF JANUARY,Surely there would not be all this pomp of preparation as to the means
6754,FIRST OF JANUARY,"of communion, unless there were like to be something worthy to be"
6755,FIRST OF JANUARY,communicated.
6756,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6757,FIRST OF JANUARY,"Amid the signs of the breaking down of barriers, we may mention the"
6758,FIRST OF JANUARY,Emperor Nicholas letting his daughter pass from the Greek to the Roman
6759,FIRST OF JANUARY,"church, for the sake of marrying her to the Austrian prince. Again,"
6760,FIRST OF JANUARY,"similarity between him and us: he, too, is shameless; for while he signs"
6761,FIRST OF JANUARY,"this marriage contract with one hand, he holds the knout in the other to"
6762,FIRST OF JANUARY,drive the Roman Catholic Poles into the Greek church. But it is a fatal
6763,FIRST OF JANUARY,"sign for his empire. 'Tis but the first step that costs, and the"
6764,FIRST OF JANUARY,"Russians may look back to the marriage of the Grand Duchess Olga, as the"
6765,FIRST OF JANUARY,"Chinese will to the cannonading of the English, as the first sign of"
6766,FIRST OF JANUARY,dissolution in the present form of national life.
6767,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6768,FIRST OF JANUARY,A similar token is given by the violation of etiquette of which Mr. Polk
6769,FIRST OF JANUARY,"is accused in his message. He, at the head of a government, speaks of"
6770,FIRST OF JANUARY,"governments and their doings straightforward, as he would of persons,"
6771,FIRST OF JANUARY,"and the tower, stronghold of the idea of a former age, now propped up by"
6772,FIRST OF JANUARY,"etiquettes and civilities only, trembles to its foundation."
6773,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6774,FIRST OF JANUARY,Another sign of the times is the general panic which the decay of the
6775,FIRST OF JANUARY,"potato causes. We believe this is not without a providential meaning,"
6776,FIRST OF JANUARY,and will call attention still more to the wants of the people at large.
6777,FIRST OF JANUARY,"New and more provident regulations must be brought out, that they may"
6778,FIRST OF JANUARY,not again be left with only a potato between them and starvation. By
6779,FIRST OF JANUARY,another of these whimsical coincidences between the histories of
6780,FIRST OF JANUARY,"Aristocracy and Democracy, the supply of _truffles_ is also failing."
6781,FIRST OF JANUARY,"The land is losing the ""nice things"" that the queen (truly a young"
6782,FIRST OF JANUARY,queen) thought might be eaten in place of bread. Does not this indicate
6783,FIRST OF JANUARY,a period in which it will be felt that there must be provision for
6784,FIRST OF JANUARY,all--the rich shall not have their truffles if the poor are driven to
6785,FIRST OF JANUARY,"eat nettles, as the French and Irish have in bygone ages?"
6786,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6787,FIRST OF JANUARY,The poem of which we here give a prose translation lately appeared in
6788,FIRST OF JANUARY,"Germany. It is written by Moritz Hartmann, and contains the _gist_ of"
6789,FIRST OF JANUARY,the matter.
6790,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6791,FIRST OF JANUARY,
6792,MISTRESS POTATO.,MISTRESS POTATO.
6793,MISTRESS POTATO.,
6794,MISTRESS POTATO.,"There was a great stately house full of people, who have been running in"
6795,MISTRESS POTATO.,and out of its lofty gates ever since the gray times of Olympus. There
6796,MISTRESS POTATO.,"they wept, laughed, shouted, mourned, and, like day and night, came the"
6797,MISTRESS POTATO.,usual changes of joys with plagues and sorrows. Haunting that great
6798,MISTRESS POTATO.,"house up and down, making, baking, and roasting, covering and waiting on"
6799,MISTRESS POTATO.,"the table, has there lived a vast number of years a loyal serving maid"
6800,MISTRESS POTATO.,"of the olden time--her name was Mrs. Potato. She was a still, little,"
6801,MISTRESS POTATO.,"old mother, who wore no bawbles or laces, but always had to be satisfied"
6802,MISTRESS POTATO.,"with her plain, every-day clothes; and unheeded, unhonored, oftentimes"
6803,MISTRESS POTATO.,"jeered at and forgotten, she served all day at the kitchen fire, and"
6804,MISTRESS POTATO.,slept at night in the worst room. When she brought the dishes to table
6805,MISTRESS POTATO.,she got rarely a thankful glance; only at times some very poor man would
6806,MISTRESS POTATO.,in secret shake kindly her hand.
6807,MISTRESS POTATO.,
6808,MISTRESS POTATO.,"Generation after generation passed by, as the trees blossom, bear fruit,"
6809,MISTRESS POTATO.,"and wither; but faithful remained the old housemaid, always the servant"
6810,MISTRESS POTATO.,of the last heir.
6811,MISTRESS POTATO.,
6812,MISTRESS POTATO.,"But one morning--hear what happened. All the people came to table, and"
6813,MISTRESS POTATO.,"lo! there was nothing to eat, for our good old Mistress Potato had not"
6814,MISTRESS POTATO.,been able to rise from her bed. She felt sharp pains creeping through
6815,MISTRESS POTATO.,her poor old bones. No wonder she was worn out at last! She had not in
6816,MISTRESS POTATO.,"all her life dared take a day's rest, lest so the poor should starve."
6817,MISTRESS POTATO.,"Indeed, it is wonderful that her good will should have kept her up so"
6818,MISTRESS POTATO.,long. She must have had a great constitution to begin with.
6819,MISTRESS POTATO.,
6820,MISTRESS POTATO.,The guests had to go away without breakfast. They were a little
6821,MISTRESS POTATO.,"troubled, but hoped to make up for it at dinner time. But dinner time"
6822,MISTRESS POTATO.,"came, and the table was empty; and then, indeed, they began to inquire"
6823,MISTRESS POTATO.,"about the welfare of Cookmaid Potato. And up into her dark chamber,"
6824,MISTRESS POTATO.,"where she lay on her poor bed, came great and little, young and old, to"
6825,MISTRESS POTATO.,"ask after the good creature. ""What can be done for her?"" ""Bring warm"
6826,MISTRESS POTATO.,"clothes, medicine, a better bed."" ""Lay aside your work to help her."" ""If"
6827,MISTRESS POTATO.,"she dies we shall never again be able to fill the table;"" and now,"
6828,MISTRESS POTATO.,"indeed, they sang her praises."
6829,MISTRESS POTATO.,
6830,MISTRESS POTATO.,"O, what a fuss about the sick bed in that moist and mouldy chamber! and"
6831,MISTRESS POTATO.,"out doors it was just the same--priests with their masses, processions,"
6832,MISTRESS POTATO.,"and prayers, and all the world ready to walk to penance, if Mistress"
6833,MISTRESS POTATO.,"Potato could but be saved. And the doctors in their wigs, and"
6834,MISTRESS POTATO.,"counsellors in masks of gravity, sat there to devise some remedy to"
6835,MISTRESS POTATO.,avert this terrible ill.
6836,MISTRESS POTATO.,
6837,MISTRESS POTATO.,"As when a most illustrious dame is recovering from birth of a son, so"
6838,MISTRESS POTATO.,"now bulletins inform the world of the health of Mistress Potato, and,"
6839,MISTRESS POTATO.,"not content with what they thus learn, couriers and lackeys besiege the"
6840,MISTRESS POTATO.,"door; nay, the king's coach is stopping there. Yes! yes! the humble poor"
6841,MISTRESS POTATO.,"maid, 'tis about her they are all so frightened! Who would ever have"
6842,MISTRESS POTATO.,believed it in days when the table was nicely covered?
6843,MISTRESS POTATO.,
6844,MISTRESS POTATO.,"The gentlemen of pens and books, priests, kings, lords, and ministers,"
6845,MISTRESS POTATO.,all have senses to scent our famine. Natheless Mistress Potato gets no
6846,MISTRESS POTATO.,"better. May God help her for the sake, not of such people, but of the"
6847,MISTRESS POTATO.,"poor. For the great it is a token they should note, that all must"
6848,MISTRESS POTATO.,"crumble and fall to ruin, if they will work and weary to death the poor"
6849,MISTRESS POTATO.,maid who cooks in the kitchen.
6850,MISTRESS POTATO.,
6851,MISTRESS POTATO.,"She lived for you in the dirt and ashes, provided daily for poor and"
6852,MISTRESS POTATO.,"rich; you ought to humble yourselves for her sake. Ah, could we hope"
6853,MISTRESS POTATO.,"that you would take a hint, and _next time_ pay some heed to the"
6854,MISTRESS POTATO.,housemaid before she is worn and wearied to death!
6855,MISTRESS POTATO.,
6856,MISTRESS POTATO.,*       *       *       *       *
6857,MISTRESS POTATO.,
6858,MISTRESS POTATO.,"So sighs, rather than hopes, Moritz Hartmann. The wise ministers of"
6859,MISTRESS POTATO.,"England, indeed, seem much more composed than he supposes them. They are"
6860,MISTRESS POTATO.,"like the old man who, when he saw the avalanche coming down upon his"
6861,MISTRESS POTATO.,"village, said, ""It is coming, but I shall have time to fill my pipe once"
6862,MISTRESS POTATO.,"more."" _He_ went in to do so, and was buried beneath the ruins. But Sir"
6863,MISTRESS POTATO.,"Robert Peel, who is so deliberate, has, doubtless, manna in store for"
6864,MISTRESS POTATO.,those who have lost their customary food.
6865,MISTRESS POTATO.,
6866,MISTRESS POTATO.,"Another sign of the times is, that there are left on the earth none of"
6867,MISTRESS POTATO.,"the last dynasty of geniuses, rich in so many imperial heads. The world"
6868,MISTRESS POTATO.,"is full of talent, but it flows downward to water the plain. There are"
6869,MISTRESS POTATO.,"no towering heights, no Mont Blancs now. We cannot recall one great"
6870,MISTRESS POTATO.,"genius at this day living. The time of prophets is over, and the era"
6871,MISTRESS POTATO.,they prophesied must be at hand; in its couduct a larger proportion of
6872,MISTRESS POTATO.,the human race shall take part than ever before. As prime ministers have
6873,MISTRESS POTATO.,"succeeded kings in the substantiate of monarchy, so now shall a house of"
6874,MISTRESS POTATO.,representatives succeed prime ministers.
6875,MISTRESS POTATO.,
6876,MISTRESS POTATO.,"Altogether, it looks as if a great time was coming, and that time one of"
6877,MISTRESS POTATO.,democracy. Our country will play a ruling part. Her eagle will lead the
6878,MISTRESS POTATO.,van; but whether to soar upward to the sun or to stoop for helpless
6879,MISTRESS POTATO.,"prey, who now dares promise? At present she has scarce achieved a Roman"
6880,MISTRESS POTATO.,"nobleness, a Roman liberty; and whether her eagle is less like the"
6881,MISTRESS POTATO.,"vulture, and more like the Phoeix, than was the fierce Roman bird, we"
6882,MISTRESS POTATO.,"dare not say. May the new year give hopes of the latter, even if the"
6883,MISTRESS POTATO.,bird need first to be purified by fire.

6892,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
6893,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"It was a beautiful custom among some of the Indian tribes, once a year,"
6894,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"to extinguish all the fires, and, by a day of fasting and profound"
6895,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"devotion, to propitiate the Great Spirit for the coming year. They then"
6896,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"produced sparks by friction, and lighted up afresh the altar and the"
6897,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,hearth with the new fire.
6898,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
6899,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,And this fire was considered as the most precious and sacred gift from
6900,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"one person to another, binding them in bonds of inviolate friendship for"
6901,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"that year, certainly; with a hope that the same might endure through"
6902,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"life. From the young to the old, it was a token of the highest respect;"
6903,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"from the old to the young, of a great expectation."
6904,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
6905,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,To us would that it might be granted to solemnize the new year by the
6906,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,mental renovation of which this ceremony was the eloquent symbol. Would
6907,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"that we might extinguish, if only for a day, those fires where an"
6908,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,uninformed religious ardor has led to human sacrifices; which have
6909,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"warmed the household, but, also, prepared pernicious, more than"
6910,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"wholesome, viands for their use."
6911,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
6912,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,The Indian produced the new spark by friction. It would be a still more
6913,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"beautiful emblem, and expressive of the more extended powers of"
6914,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"civilized men, if we should draw the spark from the centre of our system"
6915,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"and the source of light, by means of the burning glass."
6916,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
6917,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"Where, then, is to be found the new knowledge, the new thought, the new"
6918,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"hope, that shall begin a new year in a spirit not discordant with ""the"
6919,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"acceptable year of the Lord""? Surely there must be such existing, if"
6920,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"latent--some sparks of new fire, pure from ashes and from smoke, worthy"
6921,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,to be offered as a new year's gift. Let us look at the signs of the
6922,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"times, to see in what spot this fire shall be sought--on what fuel it"
6923,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,may be fed. The ancients poured out libations of the choicest juices of
6924,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"earth, to express their gratitude to the Power that had enabled them to"
6925,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"be sustained from her bosom. They enfranchised slaves, to show that"
6926,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,devotion to the gods induced a sympathy with men.
6927,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
6928,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"Let us look about us to see with what rites, what acts of devotion, this"
6929,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,modern Christian nation greets the approach of the new year; by what
6930,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"signs she denotes the clear morning of a better day, such as may be"
6931,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,expected when the eagle has entered into covenant with the dove.
6932,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
6933,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,This last week brings tidings that a portion of the inhabitants of
6934,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"Illinois, the rich and blooming region on which every gift of nature has"
6935,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"been lavished, to encourage the industry and brighten the hopes of man,"
6936,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,not only refuses a libation to the Power that has so blessed their
6937,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"fields, but declares that the dew is theirs, and the sunlight is"
6938,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"theirs--that they live from and for themselves, acknowledging no"
6939,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,obligation and no duty to God or to man.[28]
6940,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
6941,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,One man has freed a slave; but a great part of the nation is now busy in
6942,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,contriving measures that may best rivet the fetters on those now
6943,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"chained, and forge them strongest for millions yet unborn."
6944,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
6945,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,Selfishness and tyranny no longer wear the mask; they walk haughtily
6946,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"abroad, affronting with their hard-hearted boasts and brazen resolves"
6947,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,the patience of the sweet heavens. National honor is trodden under foot
6948,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"for a national bribe, and neither sex nor age defends the redresser of"
6949,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,injuries from the rage of the injurer.
6950,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
6951,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"Yet, amid these reports which come flying on the paperwings of every"
6952,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"day, the scornful laugh of the gnomes, who begin to believe they can"
6953,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"buy all souls with their gold, was checked a moment when the aged"
6954,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,knight[29] of the better cause answered the challenge--truly in keeping
6955,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"with the ""chivalry"" of the time--""You are in the wrong, and I will kick"
6956,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"you,"" by holding the hands of the chevalier till those around secured"
6957,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"him. We think the man of old must have held him with his eye, as"
6958,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,physicians of moral power can insane patients. Great as are his exploits
6959,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"for his age, he cannot have much bodily strength, unless by miracle."
6960,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
6961,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,The treatment of Mr. Adams and Mr. Hoar seems to show that we are not
6962,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,fitted to emulate the savages in preparation for the new fire. The
6963,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,Indians knew how to reverence the old and the wise.
6964,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
6965,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"Among the manifestos of the day, it is impossible not to respect that of"
6966,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,the Mexican minister for the manly indignation with which he has uttered
6967,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"truths, however deep our mortification at hearing them. It has been"
6968,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"observed for the last fifty years, that the tone of diplomatic"
6969,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"correspondence was much improved, as to simplicity and directness. Once,"
6970,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"diplomacy was another name for intrigue, and a paper of this sort was"
6971,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"expected to be a mesh of artful phrases, through which the true meaning"
6972,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"might be detected, but never actually grasped. Now, here is one where an"
6973,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,occasion being afforded by the unutterable folly of the corresponding
6974,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"party, a minister speaks the truth as it lies in his mind, directly and"
6975,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"plainly, as man speaks to man. His statement will command the sympathy"
6976,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,of the civilized world.
6977,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
6978,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"As to the state papers that have followed, they are of a nature to make"
6979,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"the Austrian despot sneer, as he counts in his oratory the woollen"
6980,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,stockings he has got knit by imprisoning all the free geniuses in his
6981,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"dominions. He, at least, only appeals to the legitimacy of blood; these"
6982,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"dare appeal to legitimacy, as seen from a moral point of view. History"
6983,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"will class such claims with the brags of sharpers, who bully their"
6984,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"victims about their honor, while they stretch forth their hands for the"
6985,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"gold they have won with loaded dice. ""Do you dare to say the dice are"
6986,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"loaded? Prove it; _and_ I will shoot you for injuring my honor."""
6987,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
6988,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,The Mexican makes his gloss on the page of American honor;[30] the
6989,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,girl[31] in the Kentucky prison on that of her freedom; the delegate of
6990,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"Massachusetts,[32] on that of her union. Ye stars, whose image America"
6991,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"has placed upon her banner, answer us! Are not your unions of a"
6992,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,different sort? Do they not work to other results?
6993,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
6994,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"Yet we cannot lightly be discouraged, or alarmed, as to the destiny of"
6995,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,our country. The whole history of its discovery and early progress
6996,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,indicates too clearly the purposes of Heaven with regard to it. Could we
6997,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,relinquish the thought that it was destined for the scene of a new and
6998,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"illustrious act in the great drama, the past would be inexplicable, no"
6999,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,less than the future without hope.
7000,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
7001,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"Last week, which brought us so many unpleasant notices of home affairs,"
7002,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,brought also an account of the magnificent telescope lately perfected by
7003,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"the Earl of Rosse. With means of observation now almost divine, we"
7004,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"perceive that some of the brightest stars, of which Sirius is one, have"
7005,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"dark companions, whose presence is, by earthly spectators, only to be"
7006,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,detected from the inequalities they cause in the motions of their
7007,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"radiant companions. It was a new and most imposing illustration how, in"
7008,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"carrying out the divine scheme, of which we have as yet only spelled out"
7009,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"the few first lines, the dark is made to wait upon, and, in the full"
7010,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"result, harmonize with, the bright. The sense of such pervasive"
7011,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,analogies should enlarge patience and animate hope.
7012,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
7013,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"Yet, if offences must come, woe be to those by whom they come; and that"
7014,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"of men, who sin against a heritage like ours, is as that of the"
7015,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"backsliders among the chosen people of the elder day. We, too, have been"
7016,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"chosen, and plain indications been given, by a wonderful conjunction of"
7017,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"auspicious influences, that the ark of human hopes has been placed for"
7018,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,the present in our charge. Woe be to those who betray this trust! On
7019,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,their heads are to be heaped the curses of unnumbered ages!
7020,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
7021,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"Can he sleep, who in this past year has wickedly or lightly committed"
7022,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,acts calculated to injure the few or many; who has poisoned the ears and
7023,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,the hearts he might have rightly informed; who has steeped in tears the
7024,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"cup of thousands; who has put back, as far as in him lay, the"
7025,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,accomplishment of general good and happiness for the sake of his selfish
7026,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,aggrandizement or selfish luxury; who has sold to a party what was meant
7027,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"for mankind? If such sleep, dreadful shall be the waking."
7028,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
7029,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"""Deliver us from evil."" In public or in private, it is easy to give"
7030,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,pain--hard to give pure pleasure; easy to do evil--hard to do good. God
7031,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"does his good in the whole, despite of bad men; but only from a very"
7032,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,pure mind will he permit original good to proceed in the day. Happy
7033,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"those who can feel that during the past year, they have, to the best of"
7034,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"their knowledge, refrained from evil. Happy those who determine to"
7035,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,proceed in this by the light of conscience. It is but a spark; yet from
7036,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,that spark may be drawn fire-light enough for worlds and systems of
7037,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,worlds--and that light is ever new.
7038,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
7039,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,And with this thought rises again the memory of the fair lines that
7040,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,light has brought to view in the histories of some men. If the nation
7041,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"tends to wrong, there are yet present the ten just men. The hands and"
7042,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"lips of this great form may be impure, but pure blood flows yet within"
7043,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,her veins--the blood of the noble bands who first sought these shores
7044,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"from the British isles and France, for conscience sake. Too many have"
7045,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"come since, for bread alone. We cannot blame--we must not reject them;"
7046,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"but let us teach them, in giving them bread, to prize that salt, too,"
7047,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"without which all on earth must lose its savor. Yes! let us teach them,"
7048,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"not rail at their inevitable ignorance and unenlightened action, but"
7049,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"teach them and their children as our own; if we do so, their children"
7050,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,and ours may yet act as one body obedient to one soul; and if we act
7051,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"rightly now, that soul a pure soul."
7052,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
7053,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"And ye, sable bands, forced hither against your will, kept down here now"
7054,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"by a force hateful to nature, a will alien from God! It does sometimes"
7055,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"seem as if the avenging angel wore your hue, and would place in your"
7056,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"hands the sword to punish the cruel injustice of our fathers, the"
7057,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,selfish perversity of the sons. Yet are there no means of atonement?
7058,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"Must the innocent suffer with the guilty? Teach us, O All-Wise, the clew"
7059,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,out of this labyrinth; and if we faithfully encounter its darkness and
7060,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"dread, and emerge into clear light, wilt thou not bid us ""go and sin no"
7061,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"more""?"
7062,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
7063,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"Meanwhile, let us proceed as we can, _picking our steps_ along the"
7064,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"slippery road. If we keep the right direction, what matters it that we"
7065,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,must pass through so much mud? The promise is sure:--
7066,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
7067,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"Angels shall free the feet from stain, to their own hue of snow,"
7068,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"If, undismayed, we reach the hills where the true olives grow."
7069,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"The olive groves, which we must seek in cold and damp,"
7070,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,Alone can yield us oil for a perpetual lamp.
7071,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,Then sound again the golden horn with promise ever new;
7072,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,The princely deer will ne'er be caught by those that slack pursue;
7073,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"Let the ""White Doe"" of angel hopes be always kept in view."
7074,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
7075,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,Yes! sound again the horn--of hope the golden horn!
7076,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"Answer it, flutes and pipes, from valleys still and lorn;"
7077,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"Warders, from your high towers, with trumps of silver scorn,"
7078,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"And harps in maidens' bowers, with strings from deep hearts torn,--"
7079,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,All answer to the horn--of hope the golden horn!
7080,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
7081,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"There is still hope, there is still an America, while private lives are"
7082,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"ruled by the Puritan, by the Huguenot conscientiousness, and while there"
7083,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"are some who can repudiate, not their debts, but the supposition that"
7084,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"they will not strive to pay their debts to their age, and to Heaven, who"
7085,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,gave them a share in its great promise.
7086,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,

7093,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"This merry season of light jokes and lighter love-tokens, in which Cupid"
7094,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"presents the feathered end of the dart, as if he meant to tickle before"
7095,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"he wounded the captive, has always had a great charm for me. When but a"
7096,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"child, I saw Allston's picture of the ""Lady reading a Valentine,"" and"
7097,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"the mild womanliness of the picture, so remote from passion no less than"
7098,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"vanity, so capable of tenderness, so chastely timid in its"
7099,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"self-possession, has given a color to the gayest thoughts connected with"
7100,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"the day. From the ruff of Allston's Lady, whose clear starch is made to"
7101,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"express all rosebud thoughts of girlish retirement, the soft unfledged"
7102,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"hopes which never yet were tempted from the nest, to Sam Weller's"
7103,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"Valentine, is indeed a broad step, but one which we can take without"
7104,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,material change of mood.
7105,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,
7106,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"But of all the thoughts and pictures associated with the day, none can"
7107,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,surpass in interest those furnished by the way in which we celebrated it
7108,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,last week.
7109,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,
7110,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,The Bloomingdale Asylum for the Insane is conducted on the most wise and
7111,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"liberal plan known at the present day. Its superintendent, Dr. Earle,"
7112,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,has had ample opportunity to observe the best modes of managing this
7113,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"class of diseases both here and in Europe, and he is one able, by"
7114,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"refined sympathies and intellectual discernment, to apply the best that"
7115,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,is known and to discover more.
7116,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,
7117,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,Under his care the beautifully situated establishment at Bloomingdale
7118,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"loses every sign of the hospital and the prison, not long since thought"
7119,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"to be inseparable from such a place. It is a house of refuge, where"
7120,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,those too deeply wounded or disturbed in body or spirit to keep up that
7121,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,semblance or degree of sanity which the conduct of affairs in the world
7122,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"at large demands, may be soothed by gentle care, intelligent sympathy,"
7123,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"and a judicious attention to their physical welfare, into health, or, at"
7124,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"least, into tranquillity."
7125,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,
7126,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"Dr. Earle, in addition to modes of turning the attention from causes of"
7127,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"morbid irritation, and promoting brighter and juster thoughts, which he"
7128,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"uses in common with other institutions, has this winter delivered a"
7129,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,course of lectures to the patients. We were present at one of these some
7130,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"weeks since. The subjects touched upon were, often, of a nature to"
7131,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,demand as close attention as an audience of regular students (not
7132,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"college students, but real students) can be induced to give. The large"
7133,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"assembly present were almost uniformly silent, to appearance interested,"
7134,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,and showed a power of decorum and self-government often wanting among
7135,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,those who esteem themselves in healthful mastery of their morals and
7136,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"manners. We saw, with great satisfaction, generous thoughts and solid"
7137,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"pursuits offered, as well as light amusements, for the choice of the"
7138,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,sick in mind. For it is our experience that such sickness arises as
7139,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,often from want of concentration as any other cause. One of the noblest
7140,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"youths that ever trod this soil was wont to say, ""he was never tired, if"
7141,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"he could only see far enough."" He is now gone where his view may be less"
7142,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"bounded; but we, who stay behind, may take the hint that mania, no less"
7143,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"than the commonest forms of prejudice, bespeaks a mind which does not"
7144,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"see far enough to correct partial impressions. No doubt, in many cases,"
7145,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"dissipation of thought, after attention is once distorted into some"
7146,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"morbid direction, may be the first method of cure; but we are glad to"
7147,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,see others provided for those who are ready for them.
7148,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,
7149,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,St. Valentine's Eve had been appointed for one of the dancing parties at
7150,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"the institution, and a few friends from ""the world's people"" invited to"
7151,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,be present.
7152,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,
7153,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"At an early hour the company assembled in the well-lighted hall, still"
7154,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,gracefully wreathed with its Christmas evergreens; the music struck up
7155,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,and the company entered.
7156,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,
7157,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"And these are the people who, half a century ago, would have been"
7158,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"chained in solitary cells, screaming out their anguish till silenced by"
7159,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"threats or blows, lost, forsaken, hopeless, a blight to earth, a libel"
7160,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,upon heaven!
7161,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,
7162,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"Now, they are many of them happy, all interested. Even those who are"
7163,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"troublesome and subject to violent excitement in every-day scenes, show"
7164,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"here that the power of self-control is not lost, only lessened. Give"
7165,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"them an impulse strong enough, favorable circumstances, and they will"
7166,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,begin to use it again. They regulate their steps to music; they restrain
7167,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,their impatient impulses from respect to themselves and to others. The
7168,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"Power which shall yet shape order from all disorder, and turn ashes to"
7169,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"beauty, as violets spring up from green graves, hath them also in its"
7170,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,keeping.
7171,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,
7172,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"The party were well dressed, with care and taste. The dancing was better"
7173,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"than usual, because there was less of affectation and ennui. The party"
7174,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"was more entertaining, because native traits came out more clear from"
7175,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,the disguises of vanity and tact.
7176,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,
7177,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"There was the blue-stocking lady, a mature belle and bel-esprit. Her"
7178,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"condescending graces, her rounded compliments, her girlish, yet ""highly"
7179,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"intellectual"" vivacity, expressed no less in her head-dress than her"
7180,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"manner, were just that touch above the common with which the illustrator"
7181,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,of Dickens has thought fit to heighten the charms of Mrs. Leo Hunter.
7182,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,
7183,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"There was the travelled Englishman, _au fait_ to every thing beneath the"
7184,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"moon and beyond. With his clipped and glib phrases, his bundle of"
7185,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"conventionalities carried so neatly under his arm, and his ""My dear"
7186,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"sir,"" in the perfection of cockney dignity, what better could the most"
7187,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,select dinner party furnish us in the way of distinguished strangerhood?
7188,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,
7189,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"There was the hoidenish young girl, and the decorous, elegant lady"
7190,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"smoothing down ""the wild little thing."" There was the sarcastic observer"
7191,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"on the folly of the rest; in that, the greatest fool of all, unbeloved"
7192,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"and unloving. In contrast to this were characters altogether lovely,"
7193,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"full of all sweet affections, whose bells, if jangled out of tune, still"
7194,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,retained their true tone.
7195,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,
7196,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,One of the best things of the evening was a dance improvised by two
7197,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"elderly women. They asked the privilege of the floor, and, a suitable"
7198,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"measure being played, performed this dance in a style lively,"
7199,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"characteristic, yet moderate enough. It was true dancing, like peasant"
7200,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,dancing.
7201,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,
7202,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,An old man sang comic songs in the style of various nations and
7203,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"characters, with a dramatic expression that would have commanded"
7204,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"applause ""on any stage."""
7205,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,
7206,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"And all was done decently and in order, each biding his time. Slight"
7207,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,symptoms of impatience here and there were easily soothed by the
7208,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"approach of this, truly ""good physician,"" the touch of whose hand seemed"
7209,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,to possess a talismanic power to soothe. We doubt not that all went to
7210,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"their beds exhilarated, free from irritation, and more attuned to"
7211,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"concord than before. Good bishop Valentine! thy feast was well kept, and"
7212,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"not without the usual jokes and flings at old bachelors, the exchange of"
7213,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"sugar-plums, mottoes, and repartees."
7214,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,
7215,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,This is the second festival I have kept with those whom society has
7216,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"placed, not outside her pale, indeed, but outside the hearing of her"
7217,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"benison. Christmas I passed in a prison! There, too, I saw marks of the"
7218,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"miraculous power of love, when guided by a pure faith in the goodness of"
7219,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"its source, and intelligence as to the design of the creative"
7220,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"intelligence. I saw enough of its power, impeded as it was by the"
7221,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"ignorance of those who, eighteen hundred years after the coming of"
7222,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"Christ, still believe more in fear and force: I saw enough, I say, of"
7223,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"this power to convince me, if I needed conviction, that love is indeed"
7224,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"omnipotent, as He said it was."
7225,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,
7226,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"A companion, of that delicate nature by which a scar is felt as a"
7227,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"wound, was saddened by the thought how very little our partialities,"
7228,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"undue emotions, and manias need to be exaggerated to entitle us to rank"
7229,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"among madmen. I cannot view it so. Rather let the sense that, with all"
7230,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"our faults and follies, there is still a sound spot, a presentiment of"
7231,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"eventual health in the inmost nature, embolden us to hope, to _know_ it"
7232,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"is the same with all. A great thinker has spoken of the Greek, in"
7233,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"highest praise, as ""a self-renovating character."" But we are all Greeks,"
7234,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"if we will but think so. For the mentally or morally insane, there is no"
7235,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,irreparable ill if the principle of life can but be aroused. And it can
7236,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"never be finally benumbed, except by our own will."
7237,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,
7238,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,One of the famous pictures at Munich is of a madhouse. The painter has
7239,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,represented the moral obliquities of society exaggerated into madness;
7240,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"that is to say, self-indulgence has, in each instance, destroyed the"
7241,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,power to forbear the ill or to discern the good. A celebrated writer has
7242,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"added a little book, to be used while looking at the picture, and drawn"
7243,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,inferences of universal interest.
7244,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,
7245,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,Such would we draw; such as this! Let no one dare to call another mad
7246,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,who is not himself willing to rank in the same class for every
7247,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,perversion and fault of judgment. Let no one dare aid in punishing
7248,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,another as criminal who is not willing to suffer the penalty due to his
7249,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,own offences.
7250,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,
7251,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"Yet, while owning that we are all mad, all criminal, let us not despair,"
7252,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,but rather believe that the Ruler of all never could permit such
7253,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,wide-spread ill but to good ends. It is permitted to give us a field to
7254,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,redeem it--
7255,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,
7256,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"""to transmute, bereave"
7257,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"Of an ill influence, and a good receive."""
7258,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,
7259,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"It flows inevitably from the emancipation of our wills, the development"
7260,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"of individuality in us. These aims accomplished, all shall yet be well;"
7261,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,and it is ours to learn _how_ that good time may be hastened.
7262,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,
7263,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,We know no sign of the times more encouraging than the increasing
7264,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,nobleness and wisdom of view as to the government of asylums for the
7265,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,insane and of prisons. Whatever is learned as to these forms of society
7266,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,is learned for all. There is nothing that can be said of such government
7267,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"that must not be said, also, of the government of families, schools, and"
7268,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"states. But we have much to say on this subject, and shall revert to it"
7269,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,"again, and often, though, perhaps, not with so pleasing a theme as this"
7270,ST. VALENTINES DAY.,of St. Valentine's Eve.

7275,FOURTH OF JULY.,FOURTH OF JULY.
7276,FOURTH OF JULY.,
7277,FOURTH OF JULY.,
7278,FOURTH OF JULY.,The bells ring; the cannon rouse the echoes along the river shore; the
7279,FOURTH OF JULY.,"boys sally forth with shouts and little flags, and crackers enough to"
7280,FOURTH OF JULY.,frighten all the people they meet from sunrise to sunset. The orator is
7281,FOURTH OF JULY.,conning for the last time the speech in which he has vainly attempted to
7282,FOURTH OF JULY.,season with some new spice the yearly panegyric upon our country; its
7283,FOURTH OF JULY.,"happiness and glory; the audience is putting on its best bib and tucker,"
7284,FOURTH OF JULY.,and its blandest expression to listen.
7285,FOURTH OF JULY.,
7286,FOURTH OF JULY.,"And yet, no heart, we think, can beat to-day with one pulse of genuine,"
7287,FOURTH OF JULY.,noble joy. Those who have obtained their selfish objects will not take
7288,FOURTH OF JULY.,"especial pleasure in thinking of them to-day, while to unbiassed minds"
7289,FOURTH OF JULY.,must come sad thoughts of national honor soiled in the eyes of other
7290,FOURTH OF JULY.,"nations, of a great inheritance risked, if not forfeited."
7291,FOURTH OF JULY.,
7292,FOURTH OF JULY.,Much has been achieved in this country since the Declaration of
7293,FOURTH OF JULY.,Independence. America is rich and strong; she has shown great talent and
7294,FOURTH OF JULY.,energy; vast prospects of aggrandizement open before her. But the noble
7295,FOURTH OF JULY.,sentiment which she expressed in her early youth is tarnished; she has
7296,FOURTH OF JULY.,"shown that righteousness is not her chief desire, and her name is no"
7297,FOURTH OF JULY.,longer a watchword for the highest hopes to the rest of the world. She
7298,FOURTH OF JULY.,"knows this, but takes it very easily; she feels that she is growing"
7299,FOURTH OF JULY.,"richer and more powerful, and that seems to suffice her."
7300,FOURTH OF JULY.,
7301,FOURTH OF JULY.,These facts are deeply saddening to those who can pronounce the words
7302,FOURTH OF JULY.,"""my country"" with pride and peace only so far as steadfast virtues,"
7303,FOURTH OF JULY.,"generous impulses, find their home in that country. They cannot be"
7304,FOURTH OF JULY.,"satisfied with superficial benefits, with luxuries and the means of"
7305,FOURTH OF JULY.,obtaining knowledge which are multiplied for them. They could rejoice in
7306,FOURTH OF JULY.,"full hands and a busy brain, if the soul were expanding and the heart"
7307,FOURTH OF JULY.,"pure; but, the higher conditions being violated, what is done cannot be"
7308,FOURTH OF JULY.,done for good.
7309,FOURTH OF JULY.,
7310,FOURTH OF JULY.,Such thoughts fill patriot minds as the cannon-peal bursts upon the ear.
7311,FOURTH OF JULY.,"This year, which declares that the people at large consent to cherish"
7312,FOURTH OF JULY.,"and extend slavery as one of our ""domestic institutions,"" takes from the"
7313,FOURTH OF JULY.,"patriot his home. This year, which attests their insatiate love of"
7314,FOURTH OF JULY.,"wealth and power, quenches the flame upon the altar."
7315,FOURTH OF JULY.,
7316,FOURTH OF JULY.,Yet there remains that good part which cannot be taken away. If nations
7317,FOURTH OF JULY.,"go astray, the narrow path may always be found and followed by the"
7318,FOURTH OF JULY.,"individual man. It is hard, hard indeed, when politics and trade are"
7319,FOURTH OF JULY.,mixed up with evils so mighty that he scarcely dares touch them for fear
7320,FOURTH OF JULY.,of being defiled. He finds his activity checked in great natural outlets
7321,FOURTH OF JULY.,by the scruples of conscience. He cannot enjoy the free use of his
7322,FOURTH OF JULY.,"limbs, glowing upon a favorable tide; but struggling, panting, must fix"
7323,FOURTH OF JULY.,"his eyes upon his aim, and fight against the current to reach it. It is"
7324,FOURTH OF JULY.,"not easy, it is very hard just now, to realize the blessings of"
7325,FOURTH OF JULY.,independence.
7326,FOURTH OF JULY.,
7327,FOURTH OF JULY.,For what _is_ independence if it do not lead to freedom?--freedom from
7328,FOURTH OF JULY.,"fraud and meanness, from selfishness, from public opinion so far as it"
7329,FOURTH OF JULY.,"does not agree with the still, small voice of one's better self?"
7330,FOURTH OF JULY.,
7331,FOURTH OF JULY.,Yet there remains a great and worthy part to play. This country presents
7332,FOURTH OF JULY.,"great temptations to ill, but also great inducements to good. Her health"
7333,FOURTH OF JULY.,"and strength are so remarkable, her youth so full of life, that disease"
7334,FOURTH OF JULY.,"cannot yet have taken deep hold of her. It has bewildered her brain,"
7335,FOURTH OF JULY.,"made her steps totter, fevered, but not yet tainted, her blood. Things"
7336,FOURTH OF JULY.,are still in that state when ten just men may save the city. A few men
7337,FOURTH OF JULY.,"are wanted, able to think and act upon principles of an eternal value."
7338,FOURTH OF JULY.,The safety of the country must lie in a few such men; men who have
7339,FOURTH OF JULY.,"achieved the genuine independence, independence of wrong, of violence,"
7340,FOURTH OF JULY.,of falsehood.
7341,FOURTH OF JULY.,
7342,FOURTH OF JULY.,We want individuals to whom all eyes may turn as examples of the
7343,FOURTH OF JULY.,practicability of virtue. We want shining examples. We want
7344,FOURTH OF JULY.,"deeply-rooted characters, who cannot be moved by flattery, by fear, even"
7345,FOURTH OF JULY.,"by hope, for they work in faith. The opportunity for such men is great;"
7346,FOURTH OF JULY.,they will not be burned at the stake in their prime for bearing witness
7347,FOURTH OF JULY.,"to the truth, yet they will be tested most severely in their adherence"
7348,FOURTH OF JULY.,to it. There is nothing to hinder them from learning what is true and
7349,FOURTH OF JULY.,best; no physical tortures will be inflicted on them for expressing it.
7350,FOURTH OF JULY.,"Let men feel that in private lives, more than in public measures, must"
7351,FOURTH OF JULY.,the salvation of the country lie. If that country has so widely veered
7352,FOURTH OF JULY.,"from the course she prescribed to herself, and that the hope of the"
7353,FOURTH OF JULY.,"world prescribed to her, it must be because she had not men ripened and"
7354,FOURTH OF JULY.,confirmed for better things. They leaned too carelessly on one another;
7355,FOURTH OF JULY.,they had not deepened and purified the private lives from which the
7356,FOURTH OF JULY.,"public vitality must spring, as the verdure of the plain from the"
7357,FOURTH OF JULY.,fountains of the hills.
7358,FOURTH OF JULY.,
7359,FOURTH OF JULY.,What a vast influence is given by sincerity alone. The bier of General
7360,FOURTH OF JULY.,"Jackson has lately passed, upbearing a golden urn. The men who placed it"
7361,FOURTH OF JULY.,"there lament his departure, and esteem the measures which have led this"
7362,FOURTH OF JULY.,country to her present position wise and good. The other side esteem
7363,FOURTH OF JULY.,"them unwise, unjust, and disastrous in their consequences. But both"
7364,FOURTH OF JULY.,"respect him thus far, that his conduct was boldly sincere. The sage of"
7365,FOURTH OF JULY.,"Quincy! Men differ in their estimate of his abilities. None, probably,"
7366,FOURTH OF JULY.,"esteem his mind as one of the first magnitude. But both sides, all men,"
7367,FOURTH OF JULY.,are influenced by the bold integrity of his character. Mr. Calhoun
7368,FOURTH OF JULY.,speaks straight out what he thinks. So far as this straightforwardness
7369,FOURTH OF JULY.,"goes, he confers the benefits of virtue. If a character be uncorrupted,"
7370,FOURTH OF JULY.,"whatever bias it takes, it thus far is good and does good. It may help"
7371,FOURTH OF JULY.,"others to a higher, wiser, larger independence than its own."
7372,FOURTH OF JULY.,
7373,FOURTH OF JULY.,We know not where to look for an example of all or many of the virtues
7374,FOURTH OF JULY.,we would seek from the man who is to begin the new dynasty that is
7375,FOURTH OF JULY.,needed of fathers of the country. The country needs to be born again;
7376,FOURTH OF JULY.,"she is polluted with the lust of power, the lust of gain. She needs"
7377,FOURTH OF JULY.,fathers good enough to be godfathers--men who will stand sponsors at the
7378,FOURTH OF JULY.,"baptism with _all_ they possess, with all the goodness they can cherish,"
7379,FOURTH OF JULY.,"and all the wisdom they can win, to lead this child the way she should"
7380,FOURTH OF JULY.,"go, and never one step in another. Are there not in schools and colleges"
7381,FOURTH OF JULY.,the boys who will become such men? Are there not those on the threshold
7382,FOURTH OF JULY.,of manhood who have not yet chosen the broad way into which the
7383,FOURTH OF JULY.,"multitude rushes, led by the banner on which, strange to say, the royal"
7384,FOURTH OF JULY.,"Eagle is blazoned, together with the word Expediency? Let them decline"
7385,FOURTH OF JULY.,"that road, and take the narrow, thorny path where Integrity leads,"
7386,FOURTH OF JULY.,though with no prouder emblem than the Dove. They may there find the
7387,FOURTH OF JULY.,"needed remedy, which, like the white root, detected by the patient and"
7388,FOURTH OF JULY.,"resolved Odysseus, shall have power to restore the herd of men,"
7389,FOURTH OF JULY.,disguised by the enchantress to whom they had willingly yielded in the
7390,FOURTH OF JULY.,"forms of brutes, to the stature and beauty of men."

7395,FIRST OF AUGUST.,FIRST OF AUGUST.
7396,FIRST OF AUGUST.,
7397,FIRST OF AUGUST.,
7398,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"Among the holidays of the year, some portion of our people borrow one"
7399,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"from another land. They borrow what they fain would own, since their"
7400,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"doing so would increase, not lessen, the joy and prosperity of the"
7401,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"present owner. It is a holiday not to be celebrated, as others are, with"
7402,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"boast, and shout, and gay procession, but solemnly, yet hopefully; in"
7403,FIRST OF AUGUST.,prayer and humiliation for much ill now existing; in faith that the God
7404,FIRST OF AUGUST.,of good will not permit such ill to exist always; in aspiration to
7405,FIRST OF AUGUST.,become his instruments for removal.
7406,FIRST OF AUGUST.,
7407,FIRST OF AUGUST.,We borrow this holiday from England. We know not that she could lend us
7408,FIRST OF AUGUST.,another such. Her career has been one of selfish aggrandizement. To
7409,FIRST OF AUGUST.,carry her flag wherever the waters flow; to leave a strong mark of her
7410,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"footprint on every shore, that she might return and claim its spoils; to"
7411,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"maintain in every way her own advantage,--is and has been her object, as"
7412,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"much as that of any nation upon earth. The plundered Hindoo, the wronged"
7413,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"Irish,--for ourselves we must add the outraged Chinese, (for we look on"
7414,FIRST OF AUGUST.,all that has been written about the right of that war as mere
7415,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"sophistry,)--no less than Napoleon, walking up and down, in his ""tarred"
7416,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"great-coat,"" in the unwholesome lodge at St. Helena,--all can tell"
7417,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"whether she be righteous or generous in her conquests. Nay, let myriads"
7418,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"of her own children say whether she will abstain from sacrificing,"
7419,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"mercilessly, human freedom, happiness, and the education of immortal"
7420,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"souls, for the sake of gains of money! We speak of Napoleon, for we"
7421,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"must ever despise, with most profound contempt, the use she made of her"
7422,FIRST OF AUGUST.,power on that occasion. She had been the chief means of liberating
7423,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"Europe from his tyranny, and, though it was for her own sake, we must"
7424,FIRST OF AUGUST.,commend and admire her conduct and resolution thus far. But the
7425,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"unhandsome, base treatment of her captive, has never been enough"
7426,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"contemned. Any private gentleman, in chaining up the foe that had put"
7427,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"himself in his power, would at least have given him lodging, food, and"
7428,FIRST OF AUGUST.,clothes to his liking; and a civil turnkey--and a great nation could
7429,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"fail in this! O, it was shameful, if only for the vulgarity of feeling"
7430,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"evinced! All this we say, because we are sometimes impatient of"
7431,FIRST OF AUGUST.,England's brag on the subject of slavery. Freedom! Because she has done
7432,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"one good act, is she entitled to the angelic privilege of being the"
7433,FIRST OF AUGUST.,champion of freedom?
7434,FIRST OF AUGUST.,
7435,FIRST OF AUGUST.,And yet it is true that once she nobly awoke to a sense of what was
7436,FIRST OF AUGUST.,right and wise. It is true that she also acted out that sense--acted
7437,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"fully, decidedly. She was willing to make sacrifices, even of the loved"
7438,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"money. She has not let go the truth she then laid to heart, and"
7439,FIRST OF AUGUST.,continues the resolute foe of man's traffic in men. We must bend low to
7440,FIRST OF AUGUST.,her as we borrow this holiday--the anniversary of the emancipation of
7441,FIRST OF AUGUST.,slaves in the West Indies. We do not feel that the extent of her
7442,FIRST OF AUGUST.,practice justifies the extent of her preaching; yet we must feel her to
7443,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"be, in this matter, an elder sister, entitled to cry shame to us. And if"
7444,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"her feelings be those of a sister indeed, how must she mourn to see her"
7445,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"next of kin pushing back, as far as in her lies, the advance of this"
7446,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"good cause, binding those whom the old world had awakened from its sins"
7447,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"enough to loose! But courage, sister! All is not yet lost! There is here"
7448,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"a faithful band, determined to expiate the crimes that have been"
7449,FIRST OF AUGUST.,committed in the name of liberty. On this day they meet and vow
7450,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"themselves to the service; and, as they look in one another's glowing"
7451,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"eyes, they read there assurance that the end is not yet, and that they,"
7452,FIRST OF AUGUST.,forced as they are
7453,FIRST OF AUGUST.,
7454,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"""To keep in company with Pain,"
7455,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"And Fear, and Falsehood, miserable train,"""
7456,FIRST OF AUGUST.,
7457,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"""Turn that necessity to glorious gain,"""
7458,FIRST OF AUGUST.,
7459,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"""Transmute them and subdue."""
7460,FIRST OF AUGUST.,
7461,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"Indeed, we do not see that they ""bate a jot of heart or hope,"" and it is"
7462,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"because they feel that the power of the Great Spirit, and its peculiar"
7463,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"workings in the spirit of this age, are with them. There is action and"
7464,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"reaction all the time; and though the main current is obvious, there are"
7465,FIRST OF AUGUST.,many little eddies and counter-currents. Mrs. Norton writes a poem on
7466,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"the sufferings of the poor, and in it she, as episode, tunefully laments"
7467,FIRST OF AUGUST.,the sufferings of the Emperor of all the Russias for the death of a
7468,FIRST OF AUGUST.,beloved daughter. And it _was_ a deep grief; yet it did not soften his
7469,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"heart, or make it feel for man. The first signs of his recovered spirits"
7470,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"are in new efforts to crush out the heart of Poland, and to make the"
7471,FIRST OF AUGUST.,Jews lay aside the hereditary marks of their national existence--to them
7472,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"a sacrifice far worse than death. But then,--Count Apraxin is burned"
7473,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"alive by his infuriate serfs, and the life of a serf is far more"
7474,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"dog-like, or rather machine-like, than that of _our_ slaves. Still the"
7475,FIRST OF AUGUST.,serf can rise in vengeance--can admonish the autocrat that humanity may
7476,FIRST OF AUGUST.,yet turn again and rend him.
7477,FIRST OF AUGUST.,
7478,FIRST OF AUGUST.,So with us. The most shameful deed has been done that ever disgraced a
7479,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"nation, because the most contrary to consciousness of right. Other"
7480,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"nations have done wickedly, but we have surpassed them all in trampling"
7481,FIRST OF AUGUST.,under foot the principles that had been assumed as the basis of our
7482,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"national existence, and shown a willingness to forfeit our honor in the"
7483,FIRST OF AUGUST.,face of the world.
7484,FIRST OF AUGUST.,
7485,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"The following stanzas, written by a friend some time since, on the"

7543,FIRST OF AUGUST.,
7544,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"This should be sung in Charleston at nine o'clock in the evening, when"
7545,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"the drums are heard proclaiming ""dead Freedom's wake,"" as they summon to"
7546,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"their homes, or to the custody of the police, every human being with a"
7547,FIRST OF AUGUST.,black skin who is found walking without a pass from a white. Or it might
7548,FIRST OF AUGUST.,have been sung to advantage the night after Charleston had shown her
7549,FIRST OF AUGUST.,independence and care of domestic institutions by expulsion of the
7550,FIRST OF AUGUST.,venerable envoy of Massachusetts! Its expression would seem even more
7551,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"forcible than now, when sung so near the facts, when the eagle soars so"
7552,FIRST OF AUGUST.,close above his prey.
7553,FIRST OF AUGUST.,
7554,FIRST OF AUGUST.,How deep the shadow! yet cleft by light. There is a counter-current that
7555,FIRST OF AUGUST.,sets towards the deep. We are inclined to weigh as of almost equal
7556,FIRST OF AUGUST.,weight with all we have had to trouble us as to the prolongation of
7557,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"slavery, the hopes that may be gathered from the course of such a man as"
7558,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"Cassius M. Clay,--a man open to none of the accusations brought to"
7559,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"diminish the influence of abolitionists in general, for he has eaten the"
7560,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"bread wrought from slavery, and has shared the education that excuses"
7561,FIRST OF AUGUST.,the blindness of the slaveholder. He speaks as one having authority; no
7562,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"one can deny that he knows where he is. In the prime of manhood, of"
7563,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"talent, and the energy of a fine enthusiasm, he comes forward with deed"
7564,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"and word to do his devoir in this cause, never to leave the field till"
7565,FIRST OF AUGUST.,he can take with him the wronged wretches rescued by his devotion.
7566,FIRST OF AUGUST.,
7567,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"Now he has made this last sacrifice of the prejudices of ""southern"
7568,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"chivalry,"" more persons than ever will be ready to join the herald's"
7569,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"cry, ""God speed the right!"" And we cannot but believe his noble example"
7570,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"will be followed by many young men in the slaveholding ranks, brothers"
7571,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"in a new, sacred band, vowed to the duty, not merely of defending, but"
7572,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"far more sacred, of purifying their homes."
7573,FIRST OF AUGUST.,
7574,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"The event of which this day is the anniversary, affords a sufficient"
7575,FIRST OF AUGUST.,guarantee of the safety and practicability of strong measures for this
7576,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"purification. Various accounts are given to the public, of the state of"
7577,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"the British West Indies, and the foes of emancipation are of course"
7578,FIRST OF AUGUST.,constantly on the alert to detect any unfavorable result which may aid
7579,FIRST OF AUGUST.,them in opposing the good work elsewhere. But through all statements
7580,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"these facts shine clear as the sun at noonday, that the measure was"
7581,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"there carried into effect with an ease and success, and has shown in the"
7582,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"African race a degree of goodness, docility, capacity for industry and"
7583,FIRST OF AUGUST.,self-culture entirely beyond or opposed to the predictions which
7584,FIRST OF AUGUST.,darkened so many minds with fears. Those fears can never again be
7585,FIRST OF AUGUST.,entertained or uttered with the same excuse. One great example of the
7586,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"_safety of doing right_ exists; true, there is but one of the sort, but"
7587,FIRST OF AUGUST.,volumes may be preached from such a text.
7588,FIRST OF AUGUST.,
7589,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"We, however, preach not; there are too many preachers already in the"
7590,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"field, abler, more deeply devoted to the cause. Endless are the sermons"
7591,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"of these modern crusaders, these ardent ""sons of thunder,"" who have"
7592,FIRST OF AUGUST.,pledged themselves never to stop or falter till this one black spot be
7593,FIRST OF AUGUST.,purged away from the land which gave them birth. They cry aloud and
7594,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"spare not; they spare not others, but then, neither do they spare"
7595,FIRST OF AUGUST.,themselves; and such are ever the harbingers of a new advent of the Holy
7596,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"Spirit. Our venerated friend, Dr. Channing, sainted in more memories"
7597,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"than any man who has left us in this nineteenth century, uttered the"
7598,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"last of his tones of soft, solemn, convincing, persuasive eloquence, on"
7599,FIRST OF AUGUST.,this day and this occasion. The hills of Lenox laughed and were glad as
7600,FIRST OF AUGUST.,they heard him who showed in that last address (an address not only to
7601,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"the men of Lenox, but to all men, for he was in the highest sense the"
7602,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"friend of man) the unsullied purity of infancy, the indignation of youth"
7603,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"at vice and wrong, informed and tempered by the mild wisdom of age. It"
7604,FIRST OF AUGUST.,is a beautiful fact that this should have been the last public occasion
7605,FIRST OF AUGUST.,of his life.
7606,FIRST OF AUGUST.,
7607,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"Last year a noble address was delivered by R. W. Emerson, in which he"
7608,FIRST OF AUGUST.,broadly showed the _juste milieu_ views upon this subject in the holy
7609,FIRST OF AUGUST.,light of a high ideal day. The truest man grew more true as he listened;
7610,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"for the speech, though it had the force of fact and the lustre of"
7611,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"thought, was chiefly remarkable as sharing the penetrating quality of"
7612,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"the ""still small voice,"" most often heard when no man speaks. Now it"
7613,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"spoke _through_ a man; and no personalities, or prejudices, or passions"
7614,FIRST OF AUGUST.,could be perceived to veil or disturb its silver sound.
7615,FIRST OF AUGUST.,
7616,FIRST OF AUGUST.,These speeches are on record; little can be said that is not contained
7617,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"in them. But we can add evermore our aspirations for thee, O our"
7618,FIRST OF AUGUST.,country! that thou mayst not long need to borrow a _holy_ day; not long
7619,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"have all thy festivals blackened by falsehood, tyranny, and a crime for"
7620,FIRST OF AUGUST.,which neither man below nor God above can much longer pardon thee. For
7621,FIRST OF AUGUST.,ignorance may excuse error; but thine--it is vain to deny it--is
7622,FIRST OF AUGUST.,"conscious wrong, and vows thee to the Mammon whose wages are endless"
7623,FIRST OF AUGUST.,remorse or final death.
7624,FIRST OF AUGUST.,
7625,FIRST OF AUGUST.,
7626,FIRST OF AUGUST.,
7627,FIRST OF AUGUST.,
7628,THANKSGIVING.,THANKSGIVING.
7629,THANKSGIVING.,
7630,THANKSGIVING.,"""Canst thou give thanks for aught that has been given"
7631,THANKSGIVING.,Except by making earth more worthy heaven?
7632,THANKSGIVING.,Just stewardship the Master hoped from thee;
7633,THANKSGIVING.,"Harvests from time to bless eternity."""
7634,THANKSGIVING.,
7635,THANKSGIVING.,
7636,THANKSGIVING.,"Thanksgiving is peculiarly the festival day of New England. Elsewhere,"
7637,THANKSGIVING.,"other celebrations rival its attractions, but in that region where the"
7638,THANKSGIVING.,Puritans first returned thanks that some among them had been sustained
7639,THANKSGIVING.,"by a great hope and earnest resolve amid the perils of the ocean, wild"
7640,THANKSGIVING.,"beasts, and famine, the old spirit which hallowed the day still lingers,"
7641,THANKSGIVING.,and forbids that it should be entirely devoted to play and plum-pudding.
7642,THANKSGIVING.,
7643,THANKSGIVING.,"And yet, as there is always this tendency; as the twelfth-night cake is"
7644,THANKSGIVING.,"baked by many a hostess who would be puzzled if you asked her, ""Twelfth"
7645,THANKSGIVING.,"night after or before what?"" and the Christmas cake by many who know no"
7646,THANKSGIVING.,"other Christmas service, so it requires very serious assertion and proof"
7647,THANKSGIVING.,from the minister to convince his parishioners that the turkey and
7648,THANKSGIVING.,"plum-pudding, which are presently to occupy his place in their"
7649,THANKSGIVING.,"attention, should not be the chief objects of the day."
7650,THANKSGIVING.,
7651,THANKSGIVING.,"And in other regions, where the occasion is observed, it is still more"
7652,THANKSGIVING.,as one for a meeting of families and friends to the enjoyment of a good
7653,THANKSGIVING.,"dinner, than for any higher purpose."
7654,THANKSGIVING.,
7655,THANKSGIVING.,"This, indeed, is one which we want not to depreciate. If this manner of"
7656,THANKSGIVING.,keeping the day be likely to persuade the juniors of the party that the
7657,THANKSGIVING.,"celebrated Jack Horner is the prime model for brave boys, and that"
7658,THANKSGIVING.,grandparents are chiefly to be respected as the givers of grand feasts
7659,THANKSGIVING.,"yet a meeting in the spirit of kindness, however dull and blind, is not"
7660,THANKSGIVING.,wholly without use in healing differences and promoting good intentions.
7661,THANKSGIVING.,"The instinct of family love, intended by Heaven to make those of one"
7662,THANKSGIVING.,"blood the various and harmonious organs of one mind, is never wholly"
7663,THANKSGIVING.,"without good influence. Family love, I say, for family pride is never"
7664,THANKSGIVING.,"without bad influence, and it too often takes the place of its mild and"
7665,THANKSGIVING.,healthy sister.
7666,THANKSGIVING.,
7667,THANKSGIVING.,"Yet where society is at all simple, it is cheering to see the family"
7668,THANKSGIVING.,"circle thus assembled, if only because its patriarchal form is in itself"
7669,THANKSGIVING.,"so excellent. The presence of the children animates the old people,"
7670,THANKSGIVING.,while the respect and attention they demand refine the gayety of the
7671,THANKSGIVING.,"young. Yes, it is cheering to see, in some large room, the elders"
7672,THANKSGIVING.,"talking near the bright fire, while the cousins of all ages are amusing"
7673,THANKSGIVING.,"themselves in knots. Here is almost all the good, and very little of the"
7674,THANKSGIVING.,"ill, that can be found in society, got together merely for amusement."
7675,THANKSGIVING.,
7676,THANKSGIVING.,"Yet how much nobler, more exhilarating, and purer would be the"
7677,THANKSGIVING.,atmosphere of that circle if the design of its pious founders were
7678,THANKSGIVING.,remembered by those who partake this festival! if they dared not attend
7679,THANKSGIVING.,the public jubilee till private retrospect of the past year had been
7680,THANKSGIVING.,"taken in the spirit of the old rhyme, which we all bear in mind if not"
7681,THANKSGIVING.,"in heart,--"
7682,THANKSGIVING.,
7683,THANKSGIVING.,"""What hast thou done that's worth the doing,"
7684,THANKSGIVING.,And what pursued that's worth pursuing?
7685,THANKSGIVING.,"What sought thou knew'st that thou shouldst shun,"
7686,THANKSGIVING.,"What done thou shouldst have left undone?"""
7687,THANKSGIVING.,
7688,THANKSGIVING.,A crusade needs also to be made this day into the wild places of each
7689,THANKSGIVING.,"heart, taking for its device, ""Lord, cleanse thou me from secret faults;"
7690,THANKSGIVING.,"keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins."" Would not that"
7691,THANKSGIVING.,"circle be happy as if music, from invisible agents, floated through it"
7692,THANKSGIVING.,if each member of it considered every other member as a bequest from
7693,THANKSGIVING.,heaven; if he supposed that the appointed nearness in blood or lot was
7694,THANKSGIVING.,a sign to him that he must exercise his gifts of every kind as given
7695,THANKSGIVING.,"peculiarly in their behalf; that if richer in temper, in talents, in"
7696,THANKSGIVING.,"knowledge, or in worldly goods, here was the innermost circle of his"
7697,THANKSGIVING.,"poor; that he must clothe these naked, whether in body or mind, soothing"
7698,THANKSGIVING.,"the perverse, casting light into the narrow chamber, or, most welcome"
7699,THANKSGIVING.,task of all! extending a hand at the right moment to one uncertain of
7700,THANKSGIVING.,his way? It is this spirit that makes the old man to be revered as a
7701,THANKSGIVING.,"Nestor, rather than put aside like a worn-out garment. It is such a"
7702,THANKSGIVING.,spirit that sometimes has given to the young child a ministry as of a
7703,THANKSGIVING.,parent in the house.
7704,THANKSGIVING.,
7705,THANKSGIVING.,"But, if charity begin at home, it must not end there; and, while"
7706,THANKSGIVING.,"purifying the innermost circle, let us not forget that it depends upon"
7707,THANKSGIVING.,"the great circle, and that again on it; that no home can be healthful in"
7708,THANKSGIVING.,"which are not cherished seeds of good for the world at large. Thy child,"
7709,THANKSGIVING.,"thy brother, are given to thee only as an example of what is due from"
7710,THANKSGIVING.,"thee to all men. It is true that, if you, in anger, call your brother"
7711,THANKSGIVING.,"fool, no deeds of so-called philanthropy shall save you from the"
7712,THANKSGIVING.,"punishment; for your philanthropy must be from the love of excitement,"
7713,THANKSGIVING.,"not the love of man, or of goodness. But then you must visit the"
7714,THANKSGIVING.,"Gentiles also, and take time for knowing what aid the woman of Samaria"
7715,THANKSGIVING.,may need.
7716,THANKSGIVING.,
7717,THANKSGIVING.,"A noble Catholic writer, in the true sense as well as by name a"
7718,THANKSGIVING.,"Catholic, describes a tailor as giving a dinner on an occasion which had"
7719,THANKSGIVING.,"brought honor to his house, which, though a humble, was not a poor"
7720,THANKSGIVING.,"house. In his glee, the tailor was boasting a little of the favors and"
7721,THANKSGIVING.,"blessings of his lot, when suddenly a thought stung him. He stopped, and"
7722,THANKSGIVING.,"cutting away half the fowl that lay before him, sent it in a dish with"
7723,THANKSGIVING.,"the best knives, bread, and napkin, and a brotherly message that was"
7724,THANKSGIVING.,"better still, to a widow near, who must, he knew, be sitting in sadness"
7725,THANKSGIVING.,and poverty among her children. His little daughter was the messenger.
7726,THANKSGIVING.,If parents followed up the indulgences heaped upon their children at
7727,THANKSGIVING.,"Thanksgiving dinners with similar messages, there would not be danger"
7728,THANKSGIVING.,that children should think enjoyment of sensual pleasures the only
7729,THANKSGIVING.,occasion that demands Thanksgiving.
7730,THANKSGIVING.,
7731,THANKSGIVING.,"And suppose, while the children were absent on their errands of justice,"
7732,THANKSGIVING.,"as they could not fail to think them, if they compared the hovels they"
7733,THANKSGIVING.,"must visit with their own comfortable homes, their elders, touched by a"
7734,THANKSGIVING.,"sense of right, should be led from discussion of the rivalries of trade"
7735,THANKSGIVING.,or fashion to inquiry whether they could not impart of all that was
7736,THANKSGIVING.,"theirs, not merely one poor dinner once a year, but all their mental and"
7737,THANKSGIVING.,material wealth for the benefit of all men. If they do not sell it _all_
7738,THANKSGIVING.,"at once, as the rich young man was bid to do as a test of his sincerity,"
7739,THANKSGIVING.,they may find some way in which it could be invested so as to show
7740,THANKSGIVING.,enough obedience to the law and the prophets to love our neighbor as
7741,THANKSGIVING.,ourselves.
7742,THANKSGIVING.,
7743,THANKSGIVING.,And he who once gives himself to such thoughts will find it is not
7744,THANKSGIVING.,merely moral gain for which he shall return thanks another year with the
7745,THANKSGIVING.,"return of this day. In the present complex state of human affairs, you"
7746,THANKSGIVING.,cannot be kind unless you are wise. Thoughts of amaranthine bloom will
7747,THANKSGIVING.,spring up in the fields ploughed to give food to suffering men. It
7748,THANKSGIVING.,"would, indeed, seem to be a simple matter at first glance. ""Lovest thou"
7749,THANKSGIVING.,"me?""--""Feed my lambs."" But now we have not only to find pasture, but to"
7750,THANKSGIVING.,"detect the lambs under the disguise of wolves, and restore them by a"
7751,THANKSGIVING.,"spell, like that the shepherd used, to their natural form and whiteness."
7752,THANKSGIVING.,
7753,THANKSGIVING.,"And for this present day appointed for Thanksgiving, we may say that if"
7754,THANKSGIVING.,"we know of so many wrongs, woes, and errors in the world yet"
7755,THANKSGIVING.,unredressed; if in this nation recent decisions have shown a want of
7756,THANKSGIVING.,"moral discrimination in important subjects, that make us pause and doubt"
7757,THANKSGIVING.,whether we can join in the formal congratulations that we are still
7758,THANKSGIVING.,"bodily alive, unassailed by the ruder modes of warfare, and enriched"
7759,THANKSGIVING.,"with the fatness of the land; yet, on the other side, we know of causes"
7760,THANKSGIVING.,not so loudly proclaimed why we should give thanks. Abundantly and
7761,THANKSGIVING.,"humbly we must render them for the movement, now sensible in the heart"
7762,THANKSGIVING.,"of the civilized world, although it has not pervaded the entire"
7763,THANKSGIVING.,frame--for that movement of contrition and love which forbids men of
7764,THANKSGIVING.,"earnest thought to eat, drink, or be merry while other men are steeped"
7765,THANKSGIVING.,"in ignorance, corruption, and woe; which calls the king from his throne"
7766,THANKSGIVING.,"of gold, and the poet from his throne of mind, to lie with the beggar in"
7767,THANKSGIVING.,"the kennel, or raise him from it; which says to the poet, ""You must"
7768,THANKSGIVING.,"reform rather than create a world,"" and to him of the golden crown, ""You"
7769,THANKSGIVING.,"cannot long remain a king unless you are also a man."""
7770,THANKSGIVING.,
7771,THANKSGIVING.,Wherever this impulse of social or political reform darts up its rill
7772,THANKSGIVING.,"through the crusts of selfishness, scoff and dread also arise, and hang"
7773,THANKSGIVING.,like a heavy mist above it. But the voice of the rill penetrates far
7774,THANKSGIVING.,enough for those who have ears to hear. And sometimes it is the case
7775,THANKSGIVING.,"that ""those who came to scoff remain to pray."" In two articles of"
7776,THANKSGIVING.,"reviews, one foreign and one domestic, which have come under our eye"
7777,THANKSGIVING.,"within the last fortnight, the writers who began by jeering at the"
7778,THANKSGIVING.,"visionaries, seemed, as they wrote, to be touched by a sense that"
7779,THANKSGIVING.,without a high and pure faith none can have the only true vision of the
7780,THANKSGIVING.,intention of God as to the destiny of man.
7781,THANKSGIVING.,
7782,THANKSGIVING.,"We recognized as a happy omen that there is cause for thanksgiving, and"
7783,THANKSGIVING.,"that our people may be better than they seem, the recent meeting to"
7784,THANKSGIVING.,"organize an association for the benefit of prisoners. We are not, then,"
7785,THANKSGIVING.,wholly Pharisees. We shall not ask the blessing of this day in the mood
7786,THANKSGIVING.,"of, ""Lord, I thank thee that I, and my son, and my brother, are not as"
7787,THANKSGIVING.,"other men are,--not as those publicans imprisoned there,"" while the"
7788,THANKSGIVING.,"still small voice cannot make us hear its evidence that, but for"
7789,THANKSGIVING.,"instruction, example, and the ""preventing God,"" every sin that can be"
7790,THANKSGIVING.,"named might riot in our hearts. The prisoner, too, may become a man."
7791,THANKSGIVING.,Neither his open nor our secret fault must utterly dismay us. We will
7792,THANKSGIVING.,treat him as if he had a soul. We will not dare to hunt him into a
7793,THANKSGIVING.,"beast of prey, or trample him into a serpent. We will give him some"
7794,THANKSGIVING.,crumbs from the table which grace from above and parental love below
7795,THANKSGIVING.,"have spread for us, and perhaps he will recover from these ghastly"
7796,THANKSGIVING.,ulcers that deform him now.
7797,THANKSGIVING.,
7798,THANKSGIVING.,We were much pleased with the spirit of the meeting for the benefit of
7799,THANKSGIVING.,"prisoners, to which we have just alluded. It was simple, business-like,"
7800,THANKSGIVING.,"in a serious, affectionate temper. The speakers did not make phrases or"
7801,THANKSGIVING.,compliments--did not slur over the truth. The audience showed a ready
7802,THANKSGIVING.,vibration to the touch of just and tender feeling. The time was
7803,THANKSGIVING.,evidently ripe for this movement. We doubt not that many now darkened
7804,THANKSGIVING.,souls will give thanks for the ray of light that will have been let in
7805,THANKSGIVING.,"by this time next year. It is but a grain of mustard seed, but the"
7806,THANKSGIVING.,promised tree will grow swiftly if tended in a pure spirit; and the
7807,THANKSGIVING.,influence of good measures in any one place will be immediate in this
7808,THANKSGIVING.,"province, as has been the case with every attempt in behalf of another"
7809,THANKSGIVING.,"sorrowing class, the insane."
7810,THANKSGIVING.,
7811,THANKSGIVING.,While reading a notice of a successful attempt to have musical
7812,THANKSGIVING.,"performances carried through in concert by the insane at Rouen, we were"
7813,THANKSGIVING.,forcibly reminded of a similar performance we heard a few weeks ago at
7814,THANKSGIVING.,"Sing Sing. There the female prisoners joined in singing a hymn, or"
7815,THANKSGIVING.,"rather choral, which describes the last thoughts of a spirit about to be"
7816,THANKSGIVING.,"enfranchised from the body; each stanza of which ends with the words,"
7817,THANKSGIVING.,"""All is well;"" and they sang it--those suffering, degraded children of"
7818,THANKSGIVING.,society--with as gentle and resigned an expression as if they were sure
7819,THANKSGIVING.,of going to sleep in the arms of a pure mother. The good spirit that
7820,THANKSGIVING.,dwelt in the music made them its own. And shall not the good spirit of
7821,THANKSGIVING.,"religious sympathy make them its own also, and more permanently? We"
7822,THANKSGIVING.,"shall see. Should the _morally_ insane, by wise and gentle care, be won"
7823,THANKSGIVING.,"back to health, as the wretched bedlamites have been, will not the"
7824,THANKSGIVING.,angels themselves give thanks? And will any man dare take the risk of
7825,THANKSGIVING.,opposing plans that afford even a chance of such a result?
7826,THANKSGIVING.,
7827,THANKSGIVING.,"Apart also from good that is public and many-voiced, does not each of us"
7828,THANKSGIVING.,"know, in private experience, much to be thankful for? Not only the"
7829,THANKSGIVING.,innocent and daily pleasures that we have prized according to our
7830,THANKSGIVING.,"wisdom; of the sun and starry skies, the fields of green, or snow"
7831,THANKSGIVING.,"scarcely less beautiful, the loaf eaten with an appetite, the glow of"
7832,THANKSGIVING.,"labor, the gentle signs of common affection; but have not some, have not"
7833,THANKSGIVING.,"many of us, cause to be thankful for enfranchisement from error or"
7834,THANKSGIVING.,"infatuation; a growth in knowledge of outward things, and instruction"
7835,THANKSGIVING.,within the soul from a higher source. Have we not acquired a sense of
7836,THANKSGIVING.,more refined enjoyments; clear convictions; sometimes a serenity in
7837,THANKSGIVING.,"which, as in the first days of June, all things grow, and the blossom"
7838,THANKSGIVING.,gives place to fruit? Have we not been weaned from what was unfit for
7839,THANKSGIVING.,"us, or unworthy our care? and have not those ties been drawn more close,"
7840,THANKSGIVING.,"and are not those objects seen more distinctly, which shall forever be"
7841,THANKSGIVING.,"worthy the purest desires of our souls? Have we learned to do any thing,"
7842,THANKSGIVING.,"the humblest, in the service and by the spirit of the power which"
7843,THANKSGIVING.,"meaneth all things well? If so, we may give thanks, and, perhaps,"
7844,THANKSGIVING.,venture to offer our solicitations in behalf of those as yet less
7845,THANKSGIVING.,favored by circumstances. When even a few shall dare do so with the
7846,THANKSGIVING.,"whole heart--for only a pure heart, can ""avail much"" in such"
7847,THANKSGIVING.,prayers--then ALL shall soon be well.

7853,CHRISTMAS.,
7854,CHRISTMAS.,
7855,CHRISTMAS.,"Our festivals come rather too near together, since we have so few of"
7856,CHRISTMAS.,"them; thanksgiving, Christmas, new year's day,--and then none again till"
7857,CHRISTMAS.,"July. We know not but these four, with the addition of ""a day set apart"
7858,CHRISTMAS.,"for fasting and prayer,"" might answer the purposes of rest and"
7859,CHRISTMAS.,"edification, as well as a calendar full of saints' days, if they were"
7860,CHRISTMAS.,observed in a better spirit. But thanksgiving is devoted to good
7861,CHRISTMAS.,"dinners; Christmas and new year's days, to making presents and"
7862,CHRISTMAS.,"compliments; fast day, to playing at cricket and other games; and the"
7863,CHRISTMAS.,"fourth of July, to boasting of the past, rather than to plans how to"
7864,CHRISTMAS.,deserve its benefits and secure its fruits.
7865,CHRISTMAS.,
7866,CHRISTMAS.,"We value means of marking time by appointed days, because man, on one"
7867,CHRISTMAS.,"side of his nature so ardent and aspiring, is on the other so slippery"
7868,CHRISTMAS.,"and indolent a being, that he needs incessant admonitions to redeem the"
7869,CHRISTMAS.,"time. Time flows on steadily, whether he regards it or not; yet unless"
7870,CHRISTMAS.,"_he keep time_, there is no music in that flow. The sands drop with"
7871,CHRISTMAS.,"inevitable speed, yet each waits long enough to receive, if it be ready,"
7872,CHRISTMAS.,the intellectual touch that should turn it to a sand of gold.
7873,CHRISTMAS.,
7874,CHRISTMAS.,"Time, says the Grecian fable, is the parent of Power; Power is the"
7875,CHRISTMAS.,"father of Genius and Wisdom; Time, then, is grandfather of the noblest"
7876,CHRISTMAS.,"of the human family, and we must respect the aged sire whom we see on"
7877,CHRISTMAS.,"the frontispiece of the almanacs, and believe his scythe was meant to"
7878,CHRISTMAS.,mow down harvests ripened for an immortal use.
7879,CHRISTMAS.,
7880,CHRISTMAS.,"Yet the best provision made by the mind of society, at large, for these"
7881,CHRISTMAS.,"admonitions, soon loses its efficacy, and requires that individual"
7882,CHRISTMAS.,"earnestness, individual piety, should continually reanimate the most"
7883,CHRISTMAS.,beautiful form. The world has never seen arrangements which might more
7884,CHRISTMAS.,"naturally offer good suggestions, than those of the church of Rome. The"
7885,CHRISTMAS.,"founders of that church stood very near a history, radiant at every page"
7886,CHRISTMAS.,with divine light. All their rites and ceremonial days illustrate facts
7887,CHRISTMAS.,"of a universal interest. But the life with which piety, first, and"
7888,CHRISTMAS.,"afterwards the genius of great artists, invested these symbols, waned at"
7889,CHRISTMAS.,"last, except to a thoughtful few. Reverence was forgotten in the"
7890,CHRISTMAS.,"multitude of genuflections; the rosary became a string of beads, rather"
7891,CHRISTMAS.,"than a series of religious meditations, and ""the glorious company of"
7892,CHRISTMAS.,"saints and martyrs"" were not so much regarded as the teachers of"
7893,CHRISTMAS.,"heavenly truth, as intercessors to obtain for their votaries the"
7894,CHRISTMAS.,temporal gifts they craved.
7895,CHRISTMAS.,
7896,CHRISTMAS.,Yet we regret that some of these symbols had not been more reverenced by
7897,CHRISTMAS.,"Protestants, as the possible occasion of good thoughts. And among others"
7898,CHRISTMAS.,we regret that the day set apart to commemorate the birth of Jesus
7899,CHRISTMAS.,"should have been stripped, even by those who observe it, of many"
7900,CHRISTMAS.,impressive and touching accessories.
7901,CHRISTMAS.,
7902,CHRISTMAS.,If ever there was an occasion on which the arts could become all but
7903,CHRISTMAS.,"omnipotent in the service of a holy thought, it is this of the birth of"
7904,CHRISTMAS.,"the child Jesus. In the palmy days of the Catholic religion, they may be"
7905,CHRISTMAS.,"said to have wrought miracles in its behalf; and, in our colder time,"
7906,CHRISTMAS.,"when we rather reflect that light from a different point of view, than"
7907,CHRISTMAS.,"transport ourselves into it,--who, that has an eye and ear faithful to"
7908,CHRISTMAS.,"the soul, is not conscious of inexhaustible benefits from some of the"
7909,CHRISTMAS.,works by which sublime geniuses have expressed their ideas in the
7910,CHRISTMAS.,"adorations of the Magi and the Shepherds, in the Virgin with the infant"
7911,CHRISTMAS.,"Jesus, or that work which expresses what Christendom at large has not"
7912,CHRISTMAS.,"even begun to realize,--that work which makes us conscious, as we"
7913,CHRISTMAS.,"listen, why the soul of man was thought worthy and able to upbear a"
7914,CHRISTMAS.,cross of such dreadful weight--the Messiah of Handel.
7915,CHRISTMAS.,
7916,CHRISTMAS.,"Christmas would seem to be the day peculiarly sacred to children, and"
7917,CHRISTMAS.,"something of this feeling here shows itself among us, though rather from"
7918,CHRISTMAS.,German influence than of native growth. The evergreen tree is often
7919,CHRISTMAS.,"reared for the children on Christmas evening, and its branches cluster"
7920,CHRISTMAS.,"with little tokens that may, at least, give them a sense that the world"
7921,CHRISTMAS.,"is rich, and that there are some in it who care to bless them. It is a"
7922,CHRISTMAS.,"charming sight to see their glittering eyes, and well worth much trouble"
7923,CHRISTMAS.,in preparing the Christmas tree.
7924,CHRISTMAS.,
7925,CHRISTMAS.,"Yet, on this occasion as on all others, we could wish to see pleasure"
7926,CHRISTMAS.,offered them in a form less selfish than it is. When shall we read of
7927,CHRISTMAS.,"banquets prepared for the halt, the lame, and the blind, on the day that"
7928,CHRISTMAS.,is said to have brought _their_ Friend into the world? When will the
7929,CHRISTMAS.,"children be taught to ask all the cold and ragged little ones, whom they"
7930,CHRISTMAS.,have seen during the day wistfully gazing at the displays in the
7931,CHRISTMAS.,"shop-windows, to share the joys of Christmas eve?"
7932,CHRISTMAS.,
7933,CHRISTMAS.,We borrow the Christmas tree from Germany. Would that we might but
7934,CHRISTMAS.,borrow with it that feeling which pervades all their stories about the
7935,CHRISTMAS.,"influence of the Christ child; and has, I doubt not,--for the spirit of"
7936,CHRISTMAS.,"literature is always, though refined, the essence of popular"
7937,CHRISTMAS.,"life,--pervaded the conduct of children there!"
7938,CHRISTMAS.,
7939,CHRISTMAS.,We will mention two of these as happily expressive of different sides of
7940,CHRISTMAS.,the desirable character. One is a legend of the Saint Hermann Joseph.
7941,CHRISTMAS.,"The legend runs, that this saint, when a little boy, passed daily by a"
7942,CHRISTMAS.,"niche where was an image of the Virgin and Child, and delighted there to"
7943,CHRISTMAS.,"pay his devotions. His heart was so drawn towards the holy child, that,"
7944,CHRISTMAS.,"one day, having received what seemed to him a gift truly precious,--to"
7945,CHRISTMAS.,"wit, a beautiful red and yellow apple,--he ventured to offer it, with"
7946,CHRISTMAS.,"his prayer. To his unspeakable delight, the child put forth its hand"
7947,CHRISTMAS.,"and took the apple. After that day, never was a gift bestowed upon the"
7948,CHRISTMAS.,little Hermann that was not carried to the same place. He needed nothing
7949,CHRISTMAS.,"for himself, but dedicated all his childish goods to the altar."
7950,CHRISTMAS.,
7951,CHRISTMAS.,"After a while, grief comes. His father, who was a poor man, finds it"
7952,CHRISTMAS.,necessary to take him from school and bind him to a trade. He
7953,CHRISTMAS.,"communicates his woes to his friends of the niche, and the Virgin"
7954,CHRISTMAS.,"comforts him, like a mother, and bestows on him money, by means of which"
7955,CHRISTMAS.,"he rises, (not to ride in a gilt coach like Lord Mayor Whittington,) but"
7956,CHRISTMAS.,to be a learned and tender shepherd of men.
7957,CHRISTMAS.,
7958,CHRISTMAS.,Another still more touching story is that of the holy Rupert. Rupert was
7959,CHRISTMAS.,"the only child of a princely house, and had something to give besides"
7960,CHRISTMAS.,"apples. But his generosity and human love were such, that, as a child,"
7961,CHRISTMAS.,he could never see poor children suffering without despoiling himself of
7962,CHRISTMAS.,"all he had with him in their behalf. His mother was, at first,"
7963,CHRISTMAS.,"displeased at this; but when he replied, ""They are thy children too,"""
7964,CHRISTMAS.,her reproofs yielded to tears.
7965,CHRISTMAS.,
7966,CHRISTMAS.,"One time, when he had given away his coat to a poor child, he got"
7967,CHRISTMAS.,"wearied and belated on his homeward way. He lay down a while, and fell"
7968,CHRISTMAS.,"asleep. Then he dreamed that he was on a river shore, and saw a mild and"
7969,CHRISTMAS.,noble old man bathing many children. After he had plunged them into the
7970,CHRISTMAS.,"water, he would place them on a beautiful island, where they looked"
7971,CHRISTMAS.,white and glorious as little angels. Rupert was seized with strong
7972,CHRISTMAS.,"desire to join them, and begged the old man to bathe him, also, in the"
7973,CHRISTMAS.,"stream. But he was answered, ""It is not yet time."" Just then a rainbow"
7974,CHRISTMAS.,"spanned the island, and on its arch was enthroned the child Jesus,"
7975,CHRISTMAS.,dressed in a coat that Rupert knew to be his own. And the child said to
7976,CHRISTMAS.,"the others, ""See this coat; it is one my brother Rupert has just sent to"
7977,CHRISTMAS.,me. He has given us many gifts from his love; shall we not ask him to
7978,CHRISTMAS.,"join us here?"" And they shouted a musical ""yes;"" and the child started"
7979,CHRISTMAS.,"from his dream. But he had lain too long on the damp bank of the river,"
7980,CHRISTMAS.,"without his coat. A cold, and fever soon sent him to join the band of"
7981,CHRISTMAS.,his brothers in their home.
7982,CHRISTMAS.,
7983,CHRISTMAS.,"These are legends, superstitions, will you say? But, in casting aside"
7984,CHRISTMAS.,"the shell, have we retained the kernel? The image of the child Jesus is"
7985,CHRISTMAS.,not seen in the open street; does his spirit find other means to express
7986,CHRISTMAS.,"itself there? Protestantism did not mean, we suppose, to deaden the"
7987,CHRISTMAS.,spirit in excluding the form?
7988,CHRISTMAS.,
7989,CHRISTMAS.,"The thought of Jesus, as a child, has great weight with children who"
7990,CHRISTMAS.,"have learned to think of him at all. In thinking of him, they form an"
7991,CHRISTMAS.,image of all that the morning of a pure and fervent life should be and
7992,CHRISTMAS.,"bring. In former days I knew a boy artist, whose genius, at that time,"
7993,CHRISTMAS.,"showed high promise. He was not more than fourteen years old; a slight,"
7994,CHRISTMAS.,"pale boy, with a beaming eye. The hopes and sympathy of friends, gained"
7995,CHRISTMAS.,"by his talent, had furnished him with a studio and orders for some"
7996,CHRISTMAS.,pictures. He had picked up from the streets a boy still younger and
7997,CHRISTMAS.,"poorer than himself, to take care of the room and prepare his colors;"
7998,CHRISTMAS.,and the two boys were as content in their relation as Michael Angelo
7999,CHRISTMAS.,with his Urbino. If you went there you found exposed to view many pretty
8000,CHRISTMAS.,"pictures: a Girl with a Dove, the Guitar Player and such subjects as are"
8001,CHRISTMAS.,"commonly supposed to interest at his age. But, hid in a corner, and"
8002,CHRISTMAS.,"never, shown, unless to the beggar page, or some most confidential"
8003,CHRISTMAS.,"friend, was the real object of his love and pride, the slowly growing"
8004,CHRISTMAS.,work of secret hours. The subject of this picture was Christ teaching
8005,CHRISTMAS.,the doctors. And in those doctors he had expressed all he had already
8006,CHRISTMAS.,observed of the pedantry and shallow conceit of those in whom mature
8007,CHRISTMAS.,"years have not unfolded the soul; and in the child, all he felt that"
8008,CHRISTMAS.,"early youth should be and seek, though, alas! his own feet failed him on"
8009,CHRISTMAS.,"the difficult road. This one record of the youth of Jesus had, at"
8010,CHRISTMAS.,"least, been much to his mind."
8011,CHRISTMAS.,
8012,CHRISTMAS.,"In earlier days, the little saints thought they best imitated the"
8013,CHRISTMAS.,"Emanuel by giving apples and coats; but we know not why, in our age,"
8014,CHRISTMAS.,"that esteems itself so enlightened, they should not become also the"
8015,CHRISTMAS.,"givers of spiritual gifts. We see in them, continually, impulses that"
8016,CHRISTMAS.,only require a good direction to effect infinite good. See the little
8017,CHRISTMAS.,girls at work for foreign missions; that is not useless. They devote the
8018,CHRISTMAS.,time to a purpose that is not selfish; the horizon of their thoughts is
8019,CHRISTMAS.,extended. But they are perfectly capable of becoming home missionaries
8020,CHRISTMAS.,as well. The principle of stewardship would make them so.
8021,CHRISTMAS.,
8022,CHRISTMAS.,"I have seen a little girl of thirteen,--who had much service, too, to"
8023,CHRISTMAS.,"perform, for a hard-working mother,--in the midst of a circle of poor"
8024,CHRISTMAS.,children whom she gathered daily to a morning school. She took them from
8025,CHRISTMAS.,the door-steps and the ditches; she washed their hands and faces; she
8026,CHRISTMAS.,taught them to read and to sew; and she told them stories that had
8027,CHRISTMAS.,"delighted her own infancy. In her face, though in feature and complexion"
8028,CHRISTMAS.,"plain, was something, already, of a Madonna sweetness, and it had no way"
8029,CHRISTMAS.,eclipsed the gayety of childhood.
8030,CHRISTMAS.,
8031,CHRISTMAS.,"I have seen a boy scarce older, brought up for some time with the sons"
8032,CHRISTMAS.,"of laborers, who, so soon as he found himself possessed of superior"
8033,CHRISTMAS.,"advantages, thought not of surpassing others, but of excelling, and then"
8034,CHRISTMAS.,"imparting--and he was able to do it. If the other boys had less leisure,"
8035,CHRISTMAS.,"and could pay for less instruction, they did not suffer for it. He could"
8036,CHRISTMAS.,"not be happy unless they also could enjoy Milton, and pass from nature"
8037,CHRISTMAS.,"to natural philosophy. He performed, though in a childish way, and in no"
8038,CHRISTMAS.,"Grecian garb, the part of Apollo amid the herdsmen of Admetus."
8039,CHRISTMAS.,
8040,CHRISTMAS.,"The cause of education would be indefinitely furthered, if, in addition"
8041,CHRISTMAS.,"to formal means, there were but this principle awakened in the hearts of"
8042,CHRISTMAS.,"the young, that what they have they must bestow. All are not natural"
8043,CHRISTMAS.,"instructors, but a large proportion are; and those who do possess such a"
8044,CHRISTMAS.,talent are the best possible teachers to those a little younger than
8045,CHRISTMAS.,themselves. Many have more patience with the difficulties they have
8046,CHRISTMAS.,"lately left behind, and enjoy their power of assisting more than those"
8047,CHRISTMAS.,farther removed in age and knowledge do.
8048,CHRISTMAS.,
8049,CHRISTMAS.,Then the intercourse may be far more congenial and profitable than where
8050,CHRISTMAS.,"the teacher receives for hire all sorts of pupils, as they are sent him"
8051,CHRISTMAS.,by their guardians. Here he need only choose those who have a
8052,CHRISTMAS.,"predisposition for what he is best able to teach. And, as I would have"
8053,CHRISTMAS.,the so-called higher instruction as much diffused in this way as the
8054,CHRISTMAS.,"lower, there would be a chance of awakening all the power that now lies"
8055,CHRISTMAS.,latent.
8056,CHRISTMAS.,
8057,CHRISTMAS.,"If a girl, for instance, who has only a passable talent for music, but"
8058,CHRISTMAS.,"who, from the advantage of social position, has been able to gain"
8059,CHRISTMAS.,"thorough instruction, felt it her duty to teach whomsoever she knew that"
8060,CHRISTMAS.,"had such a talent, without money to cultivate it, the good is obvious."
8061,CHRISTMAS.,
8062,CHRISTMAS.,Those who are learning receive an immediate benefit by an effort to
8063,CHRISTMAS.,rearrange and interpret what they learn; so the use of this justice
8064,CHRISTMAS.,would be twofold.
8065,CHRISTMAS.,
8066,CHRISTMAS.,"Some efforts are made here and there; nay, sometimes there are those who"
8067,CHRISTMAS.,"can say they have returned usury for every gift of fate. And, would"
8068,CHRISTMAS.,"others make the same experiments, they might find Utopia not so far off"
8069,CHRISTMAS.,"as the children of this world, wise in securing their own selfish ease,"
8070,CHRISTMAS.,would persuade us it must always be.
8071,CHRISTMAS.,
8072,CHRISTMAS.,We have hinted what sort of Christmas box we would wish for the
8073,CHRISTMAS.,"children. It would be one full, as that of the child Christ must be, of"
8074,CHRISTMAS.,"the pieces of silver that were lost and are found. But Christmas, with"
8075,CHRISTMAS.,"its peculiar associations, has deep interest for men, and women too, no"
8076,CHRISTMAS.,"less. It has so in their mutual relations. At the time thus celebrated,"
8077,CHRISTMAS.,a pure woman saw in her child what the Son of man should be as a child
8078,CHRISTMAS.,"of God. She anticipated for him a life of glory to God, peace and good"
8079,CHRISTMAS.,"will to man. In every young mother's heart, who has any purity of heart,"
8080,CHRISTMAS.,the same feelings arise. But most of these mothers let them go without
8081,CHRISTMAS.,"obeying their instructions. If they did not, we should see other"
8082,CHRISTMAS.,children--other men than now throng our streets. The boy could not
8083,CHRISTMAS.,"invariably disappoint the mother, the man the wife, who steadily"
8084,CHRISTMAS.,demanded of him such a career.
8085,CHRISTMAS.,
8086,CHRISTMAS.,"And man looks upon woman, in this relation, always as he should. Does he"
8087,CHRISTMAS.,see in her a holy mother worthy to guard the infancy of an immortal
8088,CHRISTMAS.,soul? Then she assumes in his eyes those traits which the Romish church
8089,CHRISTMAS.,"loved to revere in Mary. Frivolity, base appetite, contempt are"
8090,CHRISTMAS.,"exorcised; and man and woman appear again in unprofaned connection, as"
8091,CHRISTMAS.,"brother and sister, the children and the servants of the one Divine"
8092,CHRISTMAS.,"Love, and pilgrims to a common aim."
8093,CHRISTMAS.,
8094,CHRISTMAS.,"Were all this right in the private sphere, the public would soon right"
8095,CHRISTMAS.,"itself also, and the nations of Christendom might join in a celebration,"
8096,CHRISTMAS.,"such as ""kings and prophets waited for,"" and so many martyrs died to"
8097,CHRISTMAS.,"achieve, of Christ-Mass."

8102,MARIANA[33],MARIANA[33]
8103,MARIANA[33],
8104,MARIANA[33],
8105,MARIANA[33],"Among those whom I met in a recent visit at Chicago was Mrs. Z., the"
8106,MARIANA[33],"aunt of an old schoolmate, to whom I impatiently hastened, to demand"
8107,MARIANA[33],"news of Mariana. The answer startled me. Mariana, so full of life, was"
8108,MARIANA[33],"dead. That form, the most rich in energy and coloring of any I had ever"
8109,MARIANA[33],"seen, had faded from the earth. The circle of youthful associations had"
8110,MARIANA[33],given way in the part that seemed the strongest. What I now learned of
8111,MARIANA[33],"the story of this life, and what was by myself remembered, may be bound"
8112,MARIANA[33],together in this slight sketch.
8113,MARIANA[33],
8114,MARIANA[33],"At the boarding school to which I was too early sent, a fond, a proud,"
8115,MARIANA[33],"and timid child, I saw among the ranks of the gay and graceful, bright"
8116,MARIANA[33],"or earnest girls, only one who interested my fancy or touched my young"
8117,MARIANA[33],"heart; and this was Mariana. She was, on the father's side, of Spanish"
8118,MARIANA[33],"Creole blood, but had been sent to the Atlantic coast, to receive a"
8119,MARIANA[33],"school education under the care of her aunt, Mrs. Z."
8120,MARIANA[33],
8121,MARIANA[33],"This lady had kept her mostly at home with herself, and Mariana had gone"
8122,MARIANA[33],from her house to a day school; but the aunt being absent for a time in
8123,MARIANA[33],"Europe, she had now been unfortunately committed for some time to the"
8124,MARIANA[33],mercies of a boarding school.
8125,MARIANA[33],
8126,MARIANA[33],"A strange bird she proved there--a lonely one, that could not make for"
8127,MARIANA[33],"itself a summer. At first, her schoolmates were captivated with her"
8128,MARIANA[33],"ways, her love of wild dances and sudden song, her freaks of passion"
8129,MARIANA[33],"and of wit. She was always new, always surprising, and, for a time,"
8130,MARIANA[33],charming.
8131,MARIANA[33],
8132,MARIANA[33],"But, after a while, they tired of her. She could never be depended on to"
8133,MARIANA[33],"join in their plans, yet she expected them to follow out hers with their"
8134,MARIANA[33],"whole strength. She was very loving, even infatuated in her own"
8135,MARIANA[33],"affections, and exacted from those who had professed any love for her,"
8136,MARIANA[33],the devotion she was willing to bestow.
8137,MARIANA[33],
8138,MARIANA[33],Yet there was a vein of haughty caprice in her character; a love of
8139,MARIANA[33],"solitude, which made her at times wish to retire entirely; and at these"
8140,MARIANA[33],"times she would expect to be thoroughly understood, and let alone, yet"
8141,MARIANA[33],to be welcomed back when she returned. She did not thwart others in
8142,MARIANA[33],"their humors, but she never doubted of great indulgence from them."
8143,MARIANA[33],
8144,MARIANA[33],"Some singular ways she had, which, when new, charmed, but, after"
8145,MARIANA[33],"acquaintance, displeased her companions. She had by nature the same"
8146,MARIANA[33],habit and power of excitement that is described in the spinning
8147,MARIANA[33],"dervishes of the East. Like them, she would spin until all around her"
8148,MARIANA[33],"were giddy, while her own brain, instead of being disturbed, was excited"
8149,MARIANA[33],"to great action. Pausing, she would declaim verse of others or her own;"
8150,MARIANA[33],"perform many parts, with strange catch-words and burdens that seemed to"
8151,MARIANA[33],"act with mystical power on her own fancy, sometimes stimulating her to"
8152,MARIANA[33],"convulse the hearer with laughter, sometimes to melt him to tears. When"
8153,MARIANA[33],"her power began to languish, she would spin again till fired to"
8154,MARIANA[33],"recommence her singular drama, into which she wove figures from the"
8155,MARIANA[33],"scenes of her earlier childhood, her companions, and the dignitaries she"
8156,MARIANA[33],"sometimes saw, with fantasies unknown to life, unknown to heaven or"
8157,MARIANA[33],earth.
8158,MARIANA[33],
8159,MARIANA[33],"This excitement, as may be supposed, was not good for her. It oftenest"
8160,MARIANA[33],"came on in the evening, and spoiled her sleep. She would wake in the"
8161,MARIANA[33],"night, and cheat her restlessness by inventions that teased, while they"
8162,MARIANA[33],sometimes diverted her companions.
8163,MARIANA[33],
8164,MARIANA[33],She was also a sleep-walker; and this one trait of her case did somewhat
8165,MARIANA[33],"alarm her guardians, who, otherwise, showed the same profound stupidity,"
8166,MARIANA[33],"as to this peculiar being, usual in the overseers of the young. They"
8167,MARIANA[33],"consulted a physician, who said she would outgrow it, and prescribed a"
8168,MARIANA[33],milk diet.
8169,MARIANA[33],
8170,MARIANA[33],"Meantime, the fever of this ardent and too early stimulated nature was"
8171,MARIANA[33],constantly increased by the restraints and narrow routine of the
8172,MARIANA[33],boarding school. She was always devising means to break in upon it. She
8173,MARIANA[33],"had a taste, which would have seemed ludicrous to her mates, if they had"
8174,MARIANA[33],"not felt some awe of her, from a touch of genius and power, that never"
8175,MARIANA[33],"left her, for costume and fancy dresses; always some sash twisted about"
8176,MARIANA[33],"her, some drapery, something odd in the arrangement of her hair and"
8177,MARIANA[33],dress; so that the methodical preceptress dared not let her go out
8178,MARIANA[33],"without a careful scrutiny and remodelling, whose soberizing effects"
8179,MARIANA[33],generally disappeared the moment she was in the free air.
8180,MARIANA[33],
8181,MARIANA[33],"At last, a vent for her was found in private theatricals. Play followed"
8182,MARIANA[33],"play, and in these and the rehearsals she found entertainment congenial"
8183,MARIANA[33],"with her. The principal parts, as a matter of course, fell to her lot;"
8184,MARIANA[33],"most of the good suggestions and arrangements came from her, and for a"
8185,MARIANA[33],time she ruled masterly and shone triumphant.
8186,MARIANA[33],
8187,MARIANA[33],During these performances the girls had heightened their natural bloom
8188,MARIANA[33],with artificial red; this was delightful to them--it was something so
8189,MARIANA[33],"out of the way. But Mariana, after the plays were over, kept her carmine"
8190,MARIANA[33],"saucer on the dressing table, and put on her blushes regularly as the"
8191,MARIANA[33],morning.
8192,MARIANA[33],
8193,MARIANA[33],"When stared and jeered at, she at first said she did it because she"
8194,MARIANA[33],"thought it made her look prettier; but, after a while, she became quite"
8195,MARIANA[33],"petulant about it--would make no reply to any joke, but merely kept on"
8196,MARIANA[33],doing it.
8197,MARIANA[33],
8198,MARIANA[33],"This irritated the girls, as all eccentricity does the world in general,"
8199,MARIANA[33],"more than vice or malignity. They talked it over among themselves, till"
8200,MARIANA[33],"they got wrought up to a desire of punishing, once for all, this"
8201,MARIANA[33],"sometimes amusing, but so often provoking nonconformist."
8202,MARIANA[33],
8203,MARIANA[33],"Having obtained the leave of the mistress, they laid, with great glee, a"
8204,MARIANA[33],"plan one evening, which was to be carried into execution next day at"
8205,MARIANA[33],dinner.
8206,MARIANA[33],
8207,MARIANA[33],Among Mariana's irregularities was a great aversion to the meal-time
8208,MARIANA[33],"ceremonial. So long, so tiresome she found it, to be seated at a certain"
8209,MARIANA[33],"moment, to wait while each one was served at so large a table, and one"
8210,MARIANA[33],where there was scarcely any conversation; from day to day it became
8211,MARIANA[33],"more heavy to her to sit there, or go there at all. Often as possible"
8212,MARIANA[33],"she excused herself on the ever-convenient plea of headache, and was"
8213,MARIANA[33],hardly ever ready when the dinner bell rang.
8214,MARIANA[33],
8215,MARIANA[33],"To-day it found her on the balcony, lost in gazing on the beautiful"
8216,MARIANA[33],"prospect. I have heard her say, afterwards, she had rarely in her life"
8217,MARIANA[33],been so happy--and she was one with whom happiness was a still rapture.
8218,MARIANA[33],It was one of the most blessed summer days; the shadows of great white
8219,MARIANA[33],clouds empurpled the distant hills for a few moments only to leave them
8220,MARIANA[33],more golden; the tall grass of the wide fields waved in the softest
8221,MARIANA[33],"breeze. Pure blue were the heavens, and the same hue of pure contentment"
8222,MARIANA[33],was in the heart of Mariana.
8223,MARIANA[33],
8224,MARIANA[33],Suddenly on her bright mood jarred the dinner bell. At first rose her
8225,MARIANA[33],"usual thought, I will not, cannot go; and then the _must_, which daily"
8226,MARIANA[33],"life can always enforce, even upon the butterflies and birds, came, and"
8227,MARIANA[33],"she walked reluctantly to her room. She merely changed her dress, and"
8228,MARIANA[33],never thought of adding the artificial rose to her cheek.
8229,MARIANA[33],
8230,MARIANA[33],"When she took her seat in the dining hall, and was asked if she would be"
8231,MARIANA[33],"helped, raising her eyes, she saw the person who asked her was deeply"
8232,MARIANA[33],"rouged, with a bright, glaring spot, perfectly round, in either cheek."
8233,MARIANA[33],She looked at the next--the same apparition! She then slowly passed her
8234,MARIANA[33],"eyes down the whole line, and saw the same, with a suppressed smile"
8235,MARIANA[33],distorting every countenance. Catching the design at once she
8236,MARIANA[33],"deliberately looked along her own side of the table, at every schoolmate"
8237,MARIANA[33],in turn; every one had joined in the trick. The teachers strove to be
8238,MARIANA[33],"grave, but she saw they enjoyed the joke. The servants could not"
8239,MARIANA[33],suppress a titter.
8240,MARIANA[33],
8241,MARIANA[33],When Warren Hastings stood at the bar of Westminster Hall; when the
8242,MARIANA[33],"Methodist preacher walked through a line of men, each of whom greeted"
8243,MARIANA[33],"him with a brickbat or a rotten egg,--they had some preparation for the"
8244,MARIANA[33],"crisis, and it might not be very difficult to meet it with an impassive"
8245,MARIANA[33],brow. Our little girl was quite unprepared to find herself in the midst
8246,MARIANA[33],"of a world which despised her, and triumphed in her disgrace."
8247,MARIANA[33],
8248,MARIANA[33],She had ruled like a queen in the midst of her companions; she had shed
8249,MARIANA[33],"her animation through their lives, and loaded them with prodigal favors,"
8250,MARIANA[33],"nor once suspected that a powerful favorite might not be loved. Now, she"
8251,MARIANA[33],felt that she had been but a dangerous plaything in the hands of those
8252,MARIANA[33],whose hearts she never had doubted.
8253,MARIANA[33],
8254,MARIANA[33],Yet the occasion found her equal to it; for Mariana had the kind of
8255,MARIANA[33],"spirit, which, in a better cause, had made the Roman matron truly say of"
8256,MARIANA[33],"her death wound, ""It is not painful, Poetus."" She did not blench--she"
8257,MARIANA[33],did not change countenance. She swallowed her dinner with apparent
8258,MARIANA[33],composure. She made remarks to those near her as if she had no eyes.
8259,MARIANA[33],
8260,MARIANA[33],"The wrath of the foe of course rose higher, and the moment they were"
8261,MARIANA[33],"freed from the restraints of the dining room, they all ran off, gayly"
8262,MARIANA[33],"calling, and sarcastically laughing, with backward glances, at Mariana,"
8263,MARIANA[33],left alone.
8264,MARIANA[33],
8265,MARIANA[33],"She went alone to her room, locked the door, and threw herself on the"
8266,MARIANA[33],"floor in strong convulsions. These had sometimes threatened her life, as"
8267,MARIANA[33],"a child, but of later years she had outgrown them. School hours came,"
8268,MARIANA[33],"and she was not there. A little girl, sent to her door, could get no"
8269,MARIANA[33],"answer. The teachers became alarmed, and broke it open. Bitter was their"
8270,MARIANA[33],penitence and that of her companions at the state in which they found
8271,MARIANA[33],"her. For some hours terrible anxiety was felt; but at last, Nature,"
8272,MARIANA[33],"exhausted, relieved herself by a deep slumber."
8273,MARIANA[33],
8274,MARIANA[33],From this Mariana rose an altered being. She made no reply to the
8275,MARIANA[33],"expressions of sorrow from her companions, none to the grave and kind,"
8276,MARIANA[33],but undiscerning comments of her teacher. She did not name the source of
8277,MARIANA[33],"her anguish, and its poisoned dart sunk deeply in. It was this thought"
8278,MARIANA[33],"which stung her so.--""What, not one, not a single one, in the hour of"
8279,MARIANA[33],"trial, to take my part! not one who refused to take part against me!"""
8280,MARIANA[33],"Past words of love, and caresses little heeded at the time, rose to her"
8281,MARIANA[33],"memory, and gave fuel to her distempered thoughts. Beyond the sense of"
8282,MARIANA[33],"universal perfidy, of burning resentment, she could not get. And"
8283,MARIANA[33],"Mariana, born for love, now hated all the world."
8284,MARIANA[33],
8285,MARIANA[33],"The change, however, which these feelings made in her conduct and"
8286,MARIANA[33],appearance bore no such construction to the careless observer. Her gay
8287,MARIANA[33],"freaks were quite gone, her wildness, her invention. Her dress was"
8288,MARIANA[33],"uniform, her manner much subdued. Her chief interest seemed now to lie"
8289,MARIANA[33],"in her studies and in music. Her companions she never sought; but they,"
8290,MARIANA[33],"partly from uneasy, remorseful feelings, partly that they really liked"
8291,MARIANA[33],"her much better now that she did not oppress and puzzle them, sought her"
8292,MARIANA[33],continually. And here the black shadow comes upon her life--the only
8293,MARIANA[33],stain upon the history of Mariana.
8294,MARIANA[33],
8295,MARIANA[33],"They talked to her as girls, having few topics, naturally do of one"
8296,MARIANA[33],"another. And the demon rose within her, and spontaneously, without"
8297,MARIANA[33],"design, generally without words of positive falsehood, she became a"
8298,MARIANA[33],genius of discord among them. She fanned those flames of envy and
8299,MARIANA[33],"jealousy which a wise, true word from a third person will often quench"
8300,MARIANA[33],"forever; by a glance, or a seemingly light reply, she planted the seeds"
8301,MARIANA[33],"of dissension, till there was scarce a peaceful affection or sincere"
8302,MARIANA[33],"intimacy in the circle where she lived, and could not but rule, for she"
8303,MARIANA[33],was one whose nature was to that of the others as fire to clay.
8304,MARIANA[33],
8305,MARIANA[33],"It was at this time that I came to the school, and first saw Mariana. Me"
8306,MARIANA[33],"she charmed at once, for I was a sentimental child, who, in my early ill"
8307,MARIANA[33],"health, had been indulged in reading novels till I had no eyes for the"
8308,MARIANA[33],"common greens and browns of life. The heroine of one of these, ""the"
8309,MARIANA[33],"Bandit's Bride,"" I immediately saw in Mariana. Surely the Bandit's Bride"
8310,MARIANA[33],"had just such hair, and such strange, lively ways, and such a sudden"
8311,MARIANA[33],"flash of the eye. The Bandit's Bride, too, was born to be"
8312,MARIANA[33],"""misunderstood"" by all but her lover. But Mariana, I was determined,"
8313,MARIANA[33],"should be more fortunate; for, until her lover appeared, I myself would"
8314,MARIANA[33],be the wise and delicate being who could understand her.
8315,MARIANA[33],
8316,MARIANA[33],"It was not, however, easy to approach her for this purpose. Did I offer"
8317,MARIANA[33],"to run and fetch her handkerchief, she was obliged to go to her room,"
8318,MARIANA[33],and would rather do it herself. She did not like to have people turn
8319,MARIANA[33],over for her the leaves of the music book as she played. Did I approach
8320,MARIANA[33],"my stool to her feet, she moved away, as if to give me room. The bunch"
8321,MARIANA[33],of wild flowers which I timidly laid beside her plate was left there.
8322,MARIANA[33],
8323,MARIANA[33],"After some weeks my desire to attract her notice really preyed upon me,"
8324,MARIANA[33],"and one day, meeting her alone in the entry, I fell upon my knees, and"
8325,MARIANA[33],"kissing her hand, cried, ""O Mariana, do let me love you, and try to love"
8326,MARIANA[33],"me a little."" But my idol snatched away her hand, and, laughing more"
8327,MARIANA[33],"wildly than the Bandit's Bride was ever described to have done, ran into"
8328,MARIANA[33],"her room. After that day her manner to me was not only cold, but"
8329,MARIANA[33],"repulsive; I felt myself scorned, and became very unhappy."
8330,MARIANA[33],
8331,MARIANA[33],"Perhaps four months had passed thus, when, one afternoon, it became"
8332,MARIANA[33],obvious that something more than common was brewing. Dismay and mystery
8333,MARIANA[33],were written in many faces of the older girls; much whispering was going
8334,MARIANA[33],on in corners.
8335,MARIANA[33],
8336,MARIANA[33],"In the evening, after prayers, the principal bade us stay; and, in a"
8337,MARIANA[33],"grave, sad voice, summoned forth Mariana to answer charges to be made"
8338,MARIANA[33],against her.
8339,MARIANA[33],
8340,MARIANA[33],"Mariana came forward, and leaned against the chimney-piece. Eight of the"
8341,MARIANA[33],"older girls came forward, and preferred against her charges--alas! too"
8342,MARIANA[33],well founded--of calumny and falsehood.
8343,MARIANA[33],
8344,MARIANA[33],"My heart sank within me, as one after the other brought up their proofs,"
8345,MARIANA[33],and I saw they were too strong to be resisted. I could not bear the
8346,MARIANA[33],thought of this second disgrace of my shining favorite. The first had
8347,MARIANA[33],"been whispered to me, though the girls did not like to talk about it. I"
8348,MARIANA[33],"must confess, such is the charm of strength to softer natures, that"
8349,MARIANA[33],neither of these crises could deprive Mariana of hers in my eyes.
8350,MARIANA[33],
8351,MARIANA[33],"At first, she defended herself with self-possession and eloquence. But"
8352,MARIANA[33],"when she found she could no more resist the truth, she suddenly threw"
8353,MARIANA[33],"herself down, dashing her head, with all her force, against the iron"
8354,MARIANA[33],"hearth, on which a fire was burning, and was taken up senseless."
8355,MARIANA[33],
8356,MARIANA[33],The affright of those present was great. Now that they had perhaps
8357,MARIANA[33],"killed her, they reflected it would have been as well if they had taken"
8358,MARIANA[33],"warning from the former occasion, and approached very carefully a nature"
8359,MARIANA[33],"so capable of any extreme. After a while she revived, with a faint"
8360,MARIANA[33],"groan, amid the sobs of her companions. I was on my knees by the bed,"
8361,MARIANA[33],and held her cold hand. One of those most aggrieved took it from me to
8362,MARIANA[33],"beg her pardon, and say it was impossible not to love her. She made no"
8363,MARIANA[33],reply.
8364,MARIANA[33],
8365,MARIANA[33],"Neither that night, nor for several days, could a word be obtained from"
8366,MARIANA[33],"her, nor would she touch food; but, when it was presented to her, or any"
8367,MARIANA[33],"one drew near for any cause, she merely turned away her head, and gave"
8368,MARIANA[33],no sign. The teacher saw that some terrible nervous affection had fallen
8369,MARIANA[33],upon her--that she grew more and more feverish. She knew not what to
8370,MARIANA[33],do.
8371,MARIANA[33],
8372,MARIANA[33],"Meanwhile, a new revolution had taken place in the mind of the"
8373,MARIANA[33],passionate but nobly-tempered child. All these months nothing but the
8374,MARIANA[33],"sense of injury had rankled in her heart. She had gone on in one mood,"
8375,MARIANA[33],"doing what the demon prompted, without scruple and without fear."
8376,MARIANA[33],
8377,MARIANA[33],"But at the moment of detection, the tide ebbed, and the bottom of her"
8378,MARIANA[33],"soul lay revealed to her eye. How black, how stained and sad! Strange,"
8379,MARIANA[33],strange that she had not seen before the baseness and cruelty of
8380,MARIANA[33],"falsehood, the loveliness of truth. Now, amid the wreck, uprose the"
8381,MARIANA[33],"moral nature which never before had attained the ascendant. ""But,"" she"
8382,MARIANA[33],"thought, ""too late sin is revealed to me in all its deformity, and"
8383,MARIANA[33],"sin-defiled, I will not, cannot live. The mainspring of life is broken."""
8384,MARIANA[33],
8385,MARIANA[33],And thus passed slowly by her hours in that black despair of which only
8386,MARIANA[33],"youth is capable. In older years men suffer more dull pain, as each"
8387,MARIANA[33],"sorrow that comes drops its leaden weight into the past, and, similar"
8388,MARIANA[33],"features of character bringing similar results, draws up the heavy"
8389,MARIANA[33],"burden buried in those depths. But only youth has energy, with fixed,"
8390,MARIANA[33],"unwinking gaze, to contemplate grief, to hold it in the arms and to the"
8391,MARIANA[33],"heart, like a child which makes it wretched, yet is indubitably its own."
8392,MARIANA[33],
8393,MARIANA[33],The lady who took charge of this sad child had never well understood her
8394,MARIANA[33],"before, but had always looked on her with great tenderness. And now love"
8395,MARIANA[33],"seemed--when all around were in greatest distress, fearing to call in"
8396,MARIANA[33],"medical aid, fearing to do without it--to teach her where the only balm"
8397,MARIANA[33],was to be found that could have healed this wounded spirit.
8398,MARIANA[33],
8399,MARIANA[33],"One night she came in, bringing a calming draught. Mariana was sitting,"
8400,MARIANA[33],"as usual, her hair loose, her dress the same robe they had put on her at"
8401,MARIANA[33],"first, her eyes fixed vacantly upon the whited wall. To the proffers and"
8402,MARIANA[33],entreaties of her nurse she made no reply.
8403,MARIANA[33],
8404,MARIANA[33],"The lady burst into tears, but Mariana did not seem even to observe it."
8405,MARIANA[33],
8406,MARIANA[33],"The lady then said, ""O my child, do not despair; do not think that one"
8407,MARIANA[33],"great fault can mar a whole life. Let me trust you, let me tell you the"
8408,MARIANA[33],"griefs of my sad life. I will tell to you, Mariana, what I never"
8409,MARIANA[33],"expected to impart to any one."""
8410,MARIANA[33],
8411,MARIANA[33],"And so she told her tale: it was one of pain, of shame, borne, not for"
8412,MARIANA[33],"herself, but for one near and dear as herself. Mariana knew the"
8413,MARIANA[33],lady--knew the pride and reserve of her nature. She had often admired to
8414,MARIANA[33],"see how the cheek, lovely, but no longer young, mantled with the deepest"
8415,MARIANA[33],"blush of youth, and the blue eyes were cast down at any little emotion:"
8416,MARIANA[33],she had understood the proud sensibility of the character. She fixed her
8417,MARIANA[33],"eyes on those now raised to hers, bright with fast-falling tears. She"
8418,MARIANA[33],"heard the story to the end, and then, without saying a word, stretched"
8419,MARIANA[33],out her hand for the cup.
8420,MARIANA[33],
8421,MARIANA[33],"She returned to life, but it was as one who has passed through the"
8422,MARIANA[33],"valley of death. The heart of stone was quite broken in her, the fiery"
8423,MARIANA[33],"life fallen from flame to coal. When her strength was a little restored,"
8424,MARIANA[33],"she had all her companions summoned, and said to them, ""I deserved to"
8425,MARIANA[33],"die, but a generous trust has called me back to life. I will be worthy"
8426,MARIANA[33],"of it, nor ever betray the truth, or resent injury more. Can you forgive"
8427,MARIANA[33],"the past?"""
8428,MARIANA[33],
8429,MARIANA[33],"And they not only forgave, but, with love and earnest tears, clasped in"
8430,MARIANA[33],their arms the returning sister. They vied with one another in offices
8431,MARIANA[33],of humble love to the humbled one; and let it be recorded as an instance
8432,MARIANA[33],"of the pure honor of which young hearts are capable, that these facts,"
8433,MARIANA[33],"known to forty persons, never, so far as I know, transpired beyond those"
8434,MARIANA[33],walls.
8435,MARIANA[33],
8436,MARIANA[33],It was not long after this that Mariana was summoned home. She went
8437,MARIANA[33],"thither a wonderfully instructed being, though in ways that those who"
8438,MARIANA[33],had sent her forth to learn little dreamed of.
8439,MARIANA[33],
8440,MARIANA[33],Never was forgotten the vow of the returning prodigal. Mariana could not
8441,MARIANA[33],"resent, could not play false. The terrible crisis which she so early"
8442,MARIANA[33],passed through probably prevented the world from hearing much of her. A
8443,MARIANA[33],wild fire was tamed in that hour of penitence at the boarding school
8444,MARIANA[33],such as has oftentimes wrapped court and camp in its destructive glow.
8445,MARIANA[33],
8446,MARIANA[33],"But great were the perils she had yet to undergo, for she was one of"
8447,MARIANA[33],"those barks which easily get beyond soundings, and ride not lightly on"
8448,MARIANA[33],the plunging billow.
8449,MARIANA[33],
8450,MARIANA[33],Her return to her native climate seconded the effects of inward
8451,MARIANA[33],revolutions. The cool airs of the north had exasperated nerves too
8452,MARIANA[33],susceptible for their tension. Those of the south restored her to a more
8453,MARIANA[33],soft and indolent state. Energy gave place to feeling--turbulence to
8454,MARIANA[33],intensity of character.
8455,MARIANA[33],
8456,MARIANA[33],"At this time, love was the natural guest; and he came to her under a"
8457,MARIANA[33],form that might have deluded one less ready for delusion.
8458,MARIANA[33],
8459,MARIANA[33],"Sylvain was a person well proportioned to her lot in years, family, and"
8460,MARIANA[33],"fortune. His personal beauty was not great, but of a noble description."
8461,MARIANA[33],"Repose marked his slow gesture, and the steady gaze of his large brown"
8462,MARIANA[33],"eye; but it was a repose that would give way to a blaze of energy, when"
8463,MARIANA[33],"the occasion called. In his stature, expression, and heavy coloring, he"
8464,MARIANA[33],might not unfitly be represented by the great magnolias that inhabit the
8465,MARIANA[33],"forests of that climate. His voice, like every thing about him, was rich"
8466,MARIANA[33],"and soft, rather than sweet or delicate."
8467,MARIANA[33],
8468,MARIANA[33],"Mariana no sooner knew him than she loved; and her love, lovely as she"
8469,MARIANA[33],"was, soon excited his. But O, it is a curse to woman to love first, or"
8470,MARIANA[33],most! In so doing she reverses the natural relations; and her heart can
8471,MARIANA[33],"never, never be satisfied with what ensues."
8472,MARIANA[33],
8473,MARIANA[33],"Mariana loved first, and loved most, for she had most force and variety"
8474,MARIANA[33],"to love with. Sylvain seemed, at first, to take her to himself, as the"
8475,MARIANA[33],deep southern night might some fair star; but it proved not so.
8476,MARIANA[33],
8477,MARIANA[33],"Mariana was a very intellectual being, and she needed companionship."
8478,MARIANA[33],"This she could only have with Sylvain, in the paths of passion and"
8479,MARIANA[33],"action. Thoughts he had none, and little delicacy of sentiment. The"
8480,MARIANA[33],gifts she loved to prepare of such for him he took with a sweet but
8481,MARIANA[33],"indolent smile; he held them lightly, and soon they fell from his grasp."
8482,MARIANA[33],"He loved to have her near him, to feel the glow and fragrance of her"
8483,MARIANA[33],"nature, but cared not to explore the little secret paths whence that"
8484,MARIANA[33],fragrance was collected.
8485,MARIANA[33],
8486,MARIANA[33],"Mariana knew not this for a long time. Loving so much, she imagined all"
8487,MARIANA[33],"the rest; and, where she felt a blank, always hoped that further"
8488,MARIANA[33],"communion would fill it up. When she found this could never be,--that"
8489,MARIANA[33],there was absolutely a whole province of her being to which nothing in
8490,MARIANA[33],"his answered,--she was too deeply in love to leave him. Often, after"
8491,MARIANA[33],"passing hours together beneath the southern moon, when, amid the sweet"
8492,MARIANA[33],"intoxication of mutual love, she still felt the desolation of solitude,"
8493,MARIANA[33],"and a repression of her finer powers, she had asked herself, Can I give"
8494,MARIANA[33],"him up? But the heart always passionately answered, No! I may be"
8495,MARIANA[33],"wretched with him, but I cannot live without him."
8496,MARIANA[33],
8497,MARIANA[33],"And the last miserable feeling of these conflicts was, that if the"
8498,MARIANA[33],lover--soon to be the bosom friend--could have dreamed of these
8499,MARIANA[33],"conflicts, he would have laughed, or else been angry, even enough to"
8500,MARIANA[33],give her up.
8501,MARIANA[33],
8502,MARIANA[33],"Ah, weakness of the strong! of those strong only where strength is"
8503,MARIANA[33],"weakness! Like others, she had the decisions of life to make before she"
8504,MARIANA[33],had light by which to make them. Let none condemn her. Those who have
8505,MARIANA[33],not erred as fatally should thank the guardian angel who gave them more
8506,MARIANA[33],"time to prepare for judgment, but blame no children who thought at arm's"
8507,MARIANA[33],"length to find the moon. Mariana, with a heart capable of highest Eros,"
8508,MARIANA[33],"gave it to one who knew love only as a flower or plaything, and bound"
8509,MARIANA[33],her heartstrings to one who parted his as lightly as the ripe fruit
8510,MARIANA[33],leaves the bough. The sequel could not fail. Many console themselves for
8511,MARIANA[33],"the one great mistake with their children, with the world. This was not"
8512,MARIANA[33],possible to Mariana. A few months of domestic life she still was almost
8513,MARIANA[33],happy. But Sylvain then grew tired. He wanted business and the world: of
8514,MARIANA[33],"these she had no knowledge, for them no faculties. He wanted in her the"
8515,MARIANA[33],head of his house; she to make her heart his home. No compromise was
8516,MARIANA[33],"possible between natures of such unequal poise, and which had met only"
8517,MARIANA[33],on one or two points. Through all its stages she
8518,MARIANA[33],
8519,MARIANA[33],"""felt"
8520,MARIANA[33],The agonizing sense
8521,MARIANA[33],Of seeing love from passion melt
8522,MARIANA[33],Into indifference;
8523,MARIANA[33],"The fearful shame, that, day by day,"
8524,MARIANA[33],"Burns onward, still to burn,"
8525,MARIANA[33],"To have thrown her precious heart away,"
8526,MARIANA[33],"And met this black return,"""
8527,MARIANA[33],
8528,MARIANA[33],till death at last closed the scene. Not that she died of one downright
8529,MARIANA[33],blow on the heart. That is not the way such cases proceed. I cannot
8530,MARIANA[33],"detail all the symptoms, for I was not there to watch them, and aunt Z.,"
8531,MARIANA[33],"who described them, was neither so faithful an observer or narrator as I"
8532,MARIANA[33],"have shown myself in the school-day passages; but, generally, they were"
8533,MARIANA[33],as follows.
8534,MARIANA[33],
8535,MARIANA[33],"Sylvain wanted to go into the world, or let it into his house. Mariana"
8536,MARIANA[33],"consented; but, with an unsatisfied heart, and no lightness of"
8537,MARIANA[33],"character, she played her part ill there. The sort of talent and"
8538,MARIANA[33],facility she had displayed in early days were not the least like what is
8539,MARIANA[33],called out in the social world by the desire to please and to shine. Her
8540,MARIANA[33],"excitement had been muse-like--that of the improvisatrice, whose"
8541,MARIANA[33],"kindling fancy seeks to create an atmosphere round it, and makes the"
8542,MARIANA[33],chain through which to set free its electric sparks. That had been a
8543,MARIANA[33],time of wild and exuberant life. After her character became more tender
8544,MARIANA[33],"and concentrated, strong affection or a pure enthusiasm might still have"
8545,MARIANA[33],called out beautiful talents in her. But in the first she was utterly
8546,MARIANA[33],disappointed. The second was not roused within her mind. She did not
8547,MARIANA[33],"expand into various life, and remained unequal; sometimes too passive,"
8548,MARIANA[33],"sometimes too ardent, and not sufficiently occupied with what occupied"
8549,MARIANA[33],those around her to come on the same level with them and embellish their
8550,MARIANA[33],hours.
8551,MARIANA[33],
8552,MARIANA[33],"Thus she lost ground daily with her husband, who, comparing her with the"
8553,MARIANA[33],"careless shining dames of society, wondered why he had found her so"
8554,MARIANA[33],charming in solitude.
8555,MARIANA[33],
8556,MARIANA[33],"At intervals, when they were left alone, Mariana wanted to open her"
8557,MARIANA[33],"heart, to tell the thoughts of her mind. She was so conscious of secret"
8558,MARIANA[33],"riches within herself, that sometimes it seemed, could she but reveal a"
8559,MARIANA[33],"glimpse of them to the eye of Sylvain, he would be attracted near her"
8560,MARIANA[33],"again, and take a path where they could walk hand in hand. Sylvain, in"
8561,MARIANA[33],"these intervals, wanted an indolent repose. His home was his castle. He"
8562,MARIANA[33],wanted no scenes too exciting there. Light jousts and plays were well
8563,MARIANA[33],"enough, but no grave encounters. He liked to lounge, to sing, to read,"
8564,MARIANA[33],"to sleep. In fine, Sylvain became the kind but preoccupied husband,"
8565,MARIANA[33],"Mariana the solitary and wretched wife. He was off, continually, with"
8566,MARIANA[33],"his male companions, on excursions or affairs of pleasure. At home"
8567,MARIANA[33],Mariana found that neither her books nor music would console her.
8568,MARIANA[33],
8569,MARIANA[33],She was of too strong a nature to yield without a struggle to so dull a
8570,MARIANA[33],"fiend as despair. She looked into other hearts, seeking whether she"
8571,MARIANA[33],could there find such home as an orphan asylum may afford. This she did
8572,MARIANA[33],"rather because the chance came to her, and it seemed unfit not to seize"
8573,MARIANA[33],"the proffered plank, than in hope; for she was not one to double her"
8574,MARIANA[33],"stakes, but rather with Cassandra power to discern early the sure course"
8575,MARIANA[33],of the game. And Cassandra whispered that she was one of those
8576,MARIANA[33],
8577,MARIANA[33],"""Whom men love not, but yet regret;"""
8578,MARIANA[33],
8579,MARIANA[33],"and so it proved. Just as in her childish days, though in a different"
8580,MARIANA[33],"form, it happened betwixt her and these companions. She could not be"
8581,MARIANA[33],"content to receive them quietly, but was stimulated to throw herself too"
8582,MARIANA[33],"much into the tie, into the hour, till she filled it too full for them."
8583,MARIANA[33],"Like Fortunio, who sought to do homage to his friends by building a fire"
8584,MARIANA[33],"of cinnamon, not knowing that its perfume would be too strong for their"
8585,MARIANA[33],"endurance, so did Mariana. What she wanted to tell they did not wish to"
8586,MARIANA[33],"hear; a little had pleased, so much overpowered, and they preferred the"
8587,MARIANA[33],"free air of the street, even, to the cinnamon perfume of her palace."
8588,MARIANA[33],
8589,MARIANA[33],"However, this did not signify; had they staid, it would not have availed"
8590,MARIANA[33],"her. It was a nobler road, a higher aim, she needed now; this did not"
8591,MARIANA[33],become clear to her.
8592,MARIANA[33],
8593,MARIANA[33],"She lost her appetite, she fell sick, had fever. Sylvain was alarmed,"
8594,MARIANA[33],nursed her tenderly; she grew better. Then his care ceased; he saw not
8595,MARIANA[33],"the mind's disease, but left her to rise into health, and recover the"
8596,MARIANA[33],"tone of her spirits, as she might. More solitary than ever, she tried to"
8597,MARIANA[33],raise herself; but she knew not yet enough. The weight laid upon her
8598,MARIANA[33],"young life was a little too heavy for it. One long day she passed alone,"
8599,MARIANA[33],and the thoughts and presages came too thick for her strength. She knew
8600,MARIANA[33],"not what to do with them, relapsed into fever, and died."
8601,MARIANA[33],
8602,MARIANA[33],"Notwithstanding this weakness, I must ever think of her as a fine sample"
8603,MARIANA[33],"of womanhood, born to shed light and life on some palace home. Had she"
8604,MARIANA[33],"known more of God and the universe, she would not have given way where"
8605,MARIANA[33],"so many have conquered. But peace be with her; she now, perhaps, has"
8606,MARIANA[33],"entered into a larger freedom, which is knowledge. With her died a great"
8607,MARIANA[33],interest in life to me. Since her I have never seen a Bandit's Bride.
8608,MARIANA[33],"She, indeed, turned out to be only a merchant's. Sylvain is married"
8609,MARIANA[33],"again to a fair and laughing girl, who will not die, probably, till"
8610,MARIANA[33],"their marriage grows a ""golden marriage."""
8611,MARIANA[33],
8612,MARIANA[33],"Aunt Z. had with her some papers of Mariana's, which faintly shadow"
8613,MARIANA[33],forth the thoughts that engaged her in the last days. One of these seems
8614,MARIANA[33],to have been written when some faint gleam had been thrown across the
8615,MARIANA[33],path only to make its darkness more visible. It seems to have been
8616,MARIANA[33],"suggested by remembrance of the beautiful ballad, _Helen of Kirconnel"
8617,MARIANA[33],"Lee_, which once she loved to recite, and in tones that would not have"
8618,MARIANA[33],sent a chill to the heart from which it came.

8718,DISAPPOINTMENT.,It marks the defect in the position of woman that one like Mariana

8723,DISAPPOINTMENT.,"women as Mariana are often lost, unless they meet some man of"

8725,DISAPPOINTMENT.,
8726,DISAPPOINTMENT.,"Van Artevelde's Elena, though in her individual nature unlike my"

8730,DISAPPOINTMENT.,"Artevelde, he was too great not to revere her rare nature, without"

8732,DISAPPOINTMENT.,"receive her entirely, and make a new life for her; man enough to be a"

8850,MEDITATION SECOND.,"his eye sparkles as he reads of the youthful triumphs of a Pompey, the"
8851,MEDITATION SECOND.,"sublime devotion of an Agis;[34] he shuts the book, he looks around him"
8852,MEDITATION SECOND.,"for a theatre whereon to do likewise--petty pursuits, mean feelings, and"
8853,MEDITATION SECOND.,trifling pleasures meet his eye; the cold breeze of selfishness has
8854,MEDITATION SECOND.,nipped every flower; the dull glow of prosaic life overpowers the
8855,MEDITATION SECOND.,"beauties of the landscape. He plunges into the unloved pursuit, or some"
8856,MEDITATION SECOND.,"despised amusement, to soothe that day's impatience, and wakes on the"

8859,MEDITATION SECOND.,holds forth a talisman which seems to promise him sure tokens. He rushes
8860,MEDITATION SECOND.,forward; the swords of foes and rivals bar the way; the ground trembles
8861,MEDITATION SECOND.,"and gives way beneath his feet; rapid streams, unseen at a distance,"
8862,MEDITATION SECOND.,"roll between him and the object of his pursuit; faint, giddy and"
8863,MEDITATION SECOND.,"exhausted by the loss of his best blood, he reaches the goal, seizes the"

8866,MEDITATION SECOND.,"friends are whelmed beneath the torrent, or have turned back"
8867,MEDITATION SECOND.,disheartened. He must struggle onward alone and ignorant as before; yet

8873,MEDITATION SECOND.,"he follows, imploring her in most moving terms to pause but a moment and"

8885,MEDITATION SECOND.,issue. They attempt to unroll their charts for the use of their
8886,MEDITATION SECOND.,"children, and their children's children. They feed the dark lantern of"

9108,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"skill in combination and calculation, and quickness of sight. His gains"
9109,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"are legitimate, so far as the present state of things permits any gains"
9110,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,to be.
9111,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9112,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,Nor is this honorable man denied his due rank in the most corrupt state
9113,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"of society. Here, happily, we draw from life, and speak of what we know."
9114,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"Honesty is, indeed, the best policy, only it is so in the long run, and"
9115,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,therefore a policy which a selfish man has not faith and patience to
9116,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"pursue. The influence of the honest man is in the end predominant, and"
9117,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,the rogues who sneer because he will not shuffle the cards in _their_
9118,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"way, are forced to bow to it at last."
9119,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9120,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"But while thus conscientious and mentally-progressive, he does not"
9121,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"forget to live. The sharp and care-worn faces, the joyless lives that"
9122,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"throng the busy street, do not make him forget his need of tender"
9123,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"affections, of the practices of bounty and love. His family, his"
9124,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"acquaintance, especially those who are struggling with the difficulties"
9125,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"of life, are not obliged to wait till he has accumulated a certain sum."
9126,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"He is sunlight and dew to them now, day by day. No less do all in his"
9127,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"employment prize and bless the just, the brotherly man. He dares not,"
9128,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"would not, climb to power upon their necks. He requites their toil"
9129,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"handsomely, always; if his success be unusual, they share the benefit."
9130,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,Their comfort is cared for in all the arrangements for their work. He
9131,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"takes care, too, to be personally acquainted with those he employs,"
9132,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"regarding them, not as mere tools of his purpose, but as human beings"
9133,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"also; he keeps them in his eye, and if it be in his power to supply"
9134,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"their need of consolation, instruction, or even pleasure, they find they"
9135,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,have a friend.
9136,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9137,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"""Nonsense!"" exclaims our sharp-eyed, thin-lipped antagonist. ""Such a man"
9138,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"would never get rich,--or even _get along_!"""
9139,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9140,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"You are mistaken, Mr. Stockjobber. Thus far many lines of our sketch are"
9141,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"drawn from real life; though for the second part, which follows, we"
9142,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"want, as yet, a worthy model."
9143,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9144,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"We must imagine, then, our ideal merchant to have grown rich in some"
9145,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,forty years of toil passed in the way we have indicated. His hair is
9146,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"touched with white, but his form is vigorous yet. Neither _gourmandise_"
9147,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"nor the fever of gain has destroyed his complexion, quenched the light"
9148,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"of his eye, or substituted sneers for smiles. He is an upright, strong,"
9149,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"sagacious, generous-looking man; and if his movements be abrupt, and his"
9150,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"language concise, somewhat beyond the standard of beauty, he is still"
9151,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"the gentleman; mercantile, but a mercantile nobleman."
9152,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9153,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,Our nation is not silly in striving for an aristocracy. Humanity longs
9154,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,for its upper classes. But the silliness consists in making them out of
9155,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"clothes, equipage, and a servile imitation of foreign manners, instead"
9156,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,of the genuine elegance and distinction that can only be produced by
9157,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"genuine culture. Shame upon the stupidity which, when all circumstances"
9158,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,leave us free for the introduction of a real aristocracy such as the
9159,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"world never saw, bases its pretensions on, or makes its bow to the"
9160,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"footman behind, the coach, instead of the person within it."
9161,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9162,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"But our merchant shall be a real nobleman, whose noble manners spring"
9163,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"from a noble mind, whose fashions from a sincere, intelligent love of"
9164,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,the beautiful.
9165,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9166,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,We will also indulge the fancy of giving him a wife and children worthy
9167,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"of himself. Having lived in sympathy with him, they have acquired no"
9168,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,taste for luxury; they do not think that the best use for wealth and
9169,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"power is in self-indulgence, but, on the contrary, that ""it is more"
9170,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"blessed to give than to receive."""
9171,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9172,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"He is now having one of those fine houses built, and, as in other"
9173,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"things, proceeds on a few simple principles. It is substantial, for he"
9174,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,wishes to give no countenance to the paper buildings that correspond
9175,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,with other worthless paper currency of a credit system. It is thoroughly
9176,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"finished and furnished, for he has a conscience about his house, as"
9177,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,about the neatness of his person. All must be of a piece. Harmony and a
9178,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"wise utility are consulted, without regard to show. Still, as a rich"
9179,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"man, we allow him reception-rooms, lofty, large, adorned with good"
9180,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"copies of ancient works of art, and fine specimens of modern."
9181,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9182,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"I admit, in this instance, the propriety of my nobleman often choosing"
9183,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"by advice of friends, who may have had more leisure and opportunity to"
9184,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,acquire a sure appreciation of merit in these walks. His character being
9185,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"simple, he will, no doubt, appreciate a great part of what is truly"
9186,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"grand and beautiful. But also, from imperfect culture, he might often"
9187,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,reject what in the end he would have found most valuable to himself and
9188,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"others. For he has not done learning, but only acquired the privilege of"
9189,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"helping to open a domestic school, in which he will find himself a pupil"
9190,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"as well as a master. So he may well make use, in furnishing himself with"
9191,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"the school apparatus, of the best counsel. The same applies to making"
9192,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,his library a good one. Only there must be no sham; no pluming himself
9193,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"on possessions that represent his wealth, but the taste of others. Our"
9194,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"nobleman is incapable of pretension, or the airs of connoisseurship; his"
9195,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,object is to furnish a home with those testimonies of a higher life in
9196,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"man, that may best aid to cultivate the same in himself and those"
9197,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,assembled round him.
9198,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9199,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,He shall also have a fine garden and greenhouses. But the flowers shall
9200,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"not be used only to decorate his apartments, or the hair of his"
9201,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"daughters, but shall often bless, by their soft and exquisite eloquence,"
9202,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"the poor invalid, or others whose sorrowful hearts find in their society"
9203,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"a consolation and a hope which nothing else bestows. For flowers, the"
9204,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"highest expression of the bounty of nature, declare that for all men,"
9205,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"not merely labor, or luxury, but gentle, buoyant, ever-energetic joy,"
9206,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"was intended, and bid us hope that we shall not forever be kept back"
9207,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,from our inheritance.
9208,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9209,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"All the persons who have aided in building up this domestic temple, from"
9210,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"the artist who painted the ceilings to the poorest hodman, shall be well"
9211,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,paid and cared for during its erection; for it is a necessary part of
9212,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"the happiness of our nobleman, to feel that all concerned in creating"
9213,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,his home are the happier for it.
9214,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9215,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"We have said nothing about the architecture of the house, and yet this"
9216,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,is only for want of room. We do consider it one grand duty of every
9217,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"person able to build a good house, also to aim at building a beautiful"
9218,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"one. We do not want imitations of what was used in other ages, nations,"
9219,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"and climates, but what is simple, noble, and in conformity with the"
9220,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"wants of our own. Room enough, simplicity of design, and judicious"
9221,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"adjustment of the parts to their uses and to the whole, are the first"
9222,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,requisites; the ornaments are merely the finish on these. We hope to see
9223,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,a good style of civic architecture long before any material improvement
9224,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"in the country edifices, for reasons that would be tedious to enumerate"
9225,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,here. Suffice it to say that we are far more anxious to see an American
9226,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,architecture than an American literature; for we are sure there is here
9227,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,already something individual to express.
9228,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9229,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"Well, suppose the house built and equipped with man and horse. You may"
9230,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"be sure my nobleman gives his ""hired help"" good accommodations for their"
9231,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"sleeping and waking hours,--baths, books, and some leisure to use them."
9232,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"Nay, I assure you--and this assurance also is drawn from life--that it"
9233,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"is possible, even in our present social relations, for the man who does"
9234,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"common justice, in these respects, to his fellows, and shows a friendly"
9235,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"heart, that thoroughly feels service to be no degradation, but an honor,"
9236,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,who believes
9237,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9238,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"""A man's a MAN for a' that;""--"
9239,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"""Honor in the king the wisdom of his service,"
9240,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"Honor in the serf the fidelity of his service,""--"
9241,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9242,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"to have around him those who do their work in serenity of mind, neither"
9243,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,deceiving nor envying him whom circumstances have enabled to command
9244,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"their service. As to the carriage, that is used for the purpose of going"
9245,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"to and fro in bad weather, or ill health, or haste, or for drives to"
9246,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,enjoy the country. But my nobleman and his family are too well born and
9247,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,bred not to prefer employing their own feet when possible. And their
9248,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"carriage is much appropriated to the use of poor invalids, even among"
9249,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"the abhorred class of poor relations, so that often they have not room"
9250,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"in it for themselves, much less for flaunting dames and lazy dandies."
9251,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9252,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"We need hardly add that, their attendants wear no liveries. They are"
9253,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"aware that, in a society where none of the causes exist that justify"
9254,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"this habit abroad, the practice would have no other result than to call"
9255,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"up a sneer to the lips of the most complaisant ""milor,"" when ""Mrs."
9256,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"Higginbottom's carriage stops the way,"" with its tawdry, ill-fancied"
9257,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"accompaniments. _Will_ none of their ""governors"" tell our cits the"
9258,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,Æsopian fable of the donkey that tried to imitate the gambols of the
9259,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,little dog?
9260,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9261,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,The wife of my nobleman is so well matched with him that she has no need
9262,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"to be the better half. She is his almoner, his counsellor, and the"
9263,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,priestess who keeps burning on the domestic hearth a fire from the fuel
9264,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"he collects in his out-door work, whose genial heart and aspiring flame"
9265,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,comfort and animate all who come within its range.
9266,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9267,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"His children are his ministers, whose leisure and various qualifications"
9268,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,enable them to carry out his good thoughts. They hold all that they
9269,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"possess--time, money, talents, acquirements--on the principle of"
9270,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,stewardship. They wake up the seeds of virtue and genius in all the
9271,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,young persons of their acquaintance; but the poorer classes are
9272,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,especially their care. Among them they seek for those who are threatened
9273,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"with dying--""mute, inglorious"" Hampdens and Miltons--but for their"
9274,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,scrutiny and care; of these they become the teachers and patrons to the
9275,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"extent of their power. Such knowledge of the arts, sciences, and just"
9276,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"principles of action as they have been favored with, they communicate,"
9277,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,and thereby form novices worthy to fill up the ranks of the true
9278,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,American aristocracy.
9279,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9280,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,And the house--it is a large one; a simple family does not fill its
9281,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"chambers. Some of them are devoted to the use of men of genius, who need"
9282,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"a serene home, free from care, while they pursue their labors for the"
9283,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"good of the world. Thus, as in the palaces of the little princes of"
9284,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"Italy in a better day, these chambers become hallowed by the nativities"
9285,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,of great thoughts; and the horoscopes of the human births that may take
9286,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"place there, are likely to read the better for it. Suffering virtue"
9287,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"sometimes finds herself taken home here, instead of being sent to the"
9288,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"almshouse, or presented with half a dollar and a ticket for coal, and"
9289,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,finds upon my nobleman's mattresses (for the wealth of Croesus would
9290,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,not lure him or his to sleep upon down) dreams of angelic protection
9291,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,which enable her to rise refreshed for the struggle of the morrow.
9292,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9293,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"The uses of hospitality are very little understood among us, so that we"
9294,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,fear generally there is a small chance of entertaining gods and angels
9295,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"unawares, as the Greeks and Hebrews did in the generous time of"
9296,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"hospitality, when every man had a claim on the roof of fellow-man. Now,"
9297,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"none is received to a bed and breakfast unless he come as ""bearer of"
9298,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"despatches"" from His Excellency So-and-so."
9299,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9300,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,But let us not be supposed to advocate the system of all work and no
9301,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"play, or to delight exclusively in the pedagogic and Goody-Two-Shoes"
9302,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"vein. Reader, if any such accompany me to this scene of my vision, cheer"
9303,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"up; I hear the sound of music in full band, and see the banquet"
9304,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,prepared. Perhaps they are even dancing the polka and redowa in those
9305,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"airy, well-lighted rooms. In another they find in the acting of"
9306,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"extempore dramas, arrangement of tableaux, little concerts or"
9307,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"recitations, intermingled with beautiful national or fancy dances, some"
9308,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"portion of the enchanting, refining, and ennobling influence of the"
9309,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,arts. The finest engravings on all subjects attend such as like to
9310,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"employ themselves more quietly, while those who can find a companion or"
9311,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"congenial group to converse with, find also plenty of recesses and still"
9312,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"rooms, with softened light, provided for their pleasure."
9313,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9314,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,There is not on this side of the Atlantic--we dare our glove upon it--a
9315,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,more devout believer than ourselves in the worship of the Muses and
9316,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"Graces, both for itself, and its importance no less to the moral than to"
9317,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,the intellectual life of a nation. Perhaps there is not one who has _so_
9318,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"deep a feeling, or so many suggestions ready, in the fulness of time, to"
9319,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,be hazarded on the subject.
9320,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9321,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"But in order to such worship, what standard is there as to admission to"
9322,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"the service? Talents of gold, or Delphian talents? fashion or elegance?"
9323,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"""standing"" or the power to move gracefully from one position to another?"
9324,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9325,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,Our nobleman did not hesitate; the handle to his door bell was not of
9326,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"gold, but mother-of-pearl, pure and prismatic."
9327,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9328,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"If he did not go into the alleys to pick up the poor, they were not"
9329,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"excluded, if qualified by intrinsic qualities to adorn the scene."
9330,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"Neither were wealth or fashion a cause of exclusion, more than of"
9331,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,admission. All depended on the person; yet he did not _seek_ his guests
9332,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"among the slaves of fashion, for he knew that persons highly endowed"
9333,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"rarely had patience with the frivolities of that class, but retired, and"
9334,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,left it to be peopled mostly by weak and plebeian natures. Yet all
9335,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"depended on the individual. Was the person fair, noble, wise, brilliant,"
9336,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"or even only youthfully innocent and gay, or venerable in a good old"
9337,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"age, he or she was welcome. Still, as simplicity of character and some"
9338,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"qualification positively good, healthy, and natural, was requisite for"
9339,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"admission, we must say the company was select. Our nobleman and his"
9340,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"family had weeded their ""circle"" carefully, year by year."
9341,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9342,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"Some valued acquaintances they had made in ball-rooms and boudoirs, and"
9343,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"kept; but far more had been made through the daily wants of life, and"
9344,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"shoemakers, seamstresses, and graziers mingled happily with artists and"
9345,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"statesmen, to the benefit of both. (N.B.--None used the poisonous weed,"
9346,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,in or out of our domestic temple.)
9347,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9348,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,I cannot tell you what infinite good our nobleman and his family were
9349,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"doing by creation of this true social centre, where the legitimate"
9350,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"aristocracy of the land assembled, not to be dazzled by expensive"
9351,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"furniture, (our nobleman bought what was good in texture and beautiful"
9352,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"in form, but not _because_ it was expensive,) not to be feasted on rare"
9353,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"wines and highly-seasoned dainties, though they found simple"
9354,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"refreshments well prepared, as indeed it was a matter of duty and"
9355,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"conscience in that house that the least office should be well fulfilled,"
9356,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,but to enjoy the generous confluence of mind with mind and heart with
9357,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"heart, the pastimes that are not waste-times of taste and inventive"
9358,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"fancy, the cordial union of beings from all points and places in noble"
9359,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"human sympathy. New York was beginning to be truly American, or rather"
9360,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"Columbian, and money stood for something in the records of history. It"
9361,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,had brought opportunity to genius and aid to virtue. But just at this
9362,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"moment, the jostling showed me that I had reached the corner of Wall"
9363,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,Street. I looked earnestly at the omnibuses discharging their eager
9364,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"freight, as if I hoped to see my merchant. ""Perhaps he has gone to the"
9365,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"post office to take out letters from his friends in Utopia,"" thought I."
9366,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"""Please give me a penny,"" screamed a half-starved ragged little"
9367,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"street-sweep, and the fancied cradle of the American Utopia receded, or"
9368,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"rather proceeded, fifty years, at least, into the future."

9373,THE POOR MAN.,THE POOR MAN.
9374,THE POOR MAN.,
9375,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,AN IDEAL SKETCH.
9376,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9377,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9378,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"The foregoing sketch of the Rich Man, seems to require this"
9379,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"companion-piece; and we shall make the attempt, though the subject is"
9380,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,far more difficult than the former was.
9381,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9382,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"In the first place, we must state what we mean by a poor man, for it is"
9383,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,a term of wide range in its relative applications. A painstaking
9384,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"artisan, trained to self-denial, and a strict adaptation, not of his"
9385,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"means to his wants, but of his wants to his means, finds himself rich"
9386,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"and grateful, if some unexpected fortune enables him to give his wife a"
9387,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"new gown, his children cheap holiday joys, and his starving neighbor a"
9388,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"decent meal; while George IV., when heir apparent to the throne of Great"
9389,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"Britain, considered himself driven by the pressure of poverty to become"
9390,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"a debtor, a beggar, a swindler, and, by the aid of perjury, the husband"
9391,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"of two wives at the same time, neither of whom he treated well. Since"
9392,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"poverty is made an excuse for such depravity in conduct, it would be"
9393,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,well to mark the limits within which self-control and resistance to
9394,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,temptation may be expected.
9395,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9396,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"When he of the olden time prayed, ""Give me neither poverty nor riches,"""
9397,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,we presume he meant that proportion of means to the average wants of a
9398,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"human being which secures freedom from pecuniary cares, freedom of"
9399,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"motion, and a moderate enjoyment of the common blessings offered by"
9400,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"earth, air, water, the natural relations, and the subjects for thought"
9401,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,which every day presents. We shall certainly not look above this point
9402,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"for our poor man. A prince may be poor, if he has not means to relieve"
9403,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"the sufferings of his subjects, or secure to them needed benefits. Or he"
9404,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"may make himself so, just as a well-paid laborer by drinking brings"
9405,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"poverty to his roof. So may the prince, by the mental gin of"
9406,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"horse-racing or gambling, grow a beggar. But we shall not consider these"
9407,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,cases.
9408,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9409,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,Our subject will be taken between the medium we have spoken of as answer
9410,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"to the wise man's prayer, and that destitution which we must style"
9411,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"infamous, either to the individual or to the society whose vices have"
9412,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"caused that stage of poverty, in which there is no certainty, and often"
9413,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"no probability, of work or bread from day to day,--in which cleanliness"
9414,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"and all the decencies of life are impossible, and the natural human"
9415,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,feelings are turned to gall because the man finds himself on this earth
9416,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,in a far worse situation than the brute. In this stage there is no
9417,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"ideal, and from its abyss, if the unfortunates look up to Heaven, or the"
9418,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"state of things as they ought to be, it is with suffocating gasps which"
9419,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"demand relief or death. This degree of poverty is common, as we all"
9420,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,know; but we who do not share it have no right to address those who do
9421,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"from our own standard, till we have placed their feet on our own level."
9422,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,Accursed is he who does not long to have this so--to take out at least
9423,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"the physical hell from this world! Unblest is he who is not seeking,"
9424,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"either by thought or act, to effect this poor degree of amelioration in"
9425,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,the circumstances of his race.
9426,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9427,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"We take the subject of our sketch, then, somewhere between the abjectly"
9428,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,poor and those in moderate circumstances. What we have to say may apply
9429,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"to either sex, and to any grade in this division of the human family,"
9430,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"from the hodman and washerwoman up to the hard-working, poorly-paid"
9431,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"lawyer clerk, schoolmaster, or scribe."

9433,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"The advantages of such a position are many. In the first place, you"
9434,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"belong, inevitably, to the active and suffering part of the world. You"
9435,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,know the ills that try men's souls and bodies. You cannot creep into a
9436,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"safe retreat, arrogantly to judge, or heartlessly to forget, the others."
9437,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,They are always before you; you see the path stained by their bleeding
9438,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"feet; stupid and flinty, indeed, must you be, if you can hastily wound,"
9439,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"or indolently forbear to aid them. Then, as to yourself, you know what"
9440,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"your resources are; what you can do, what bear; there is small chance"
9441,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"for you to escape a well-tempered modesty. Then again, if you find power"
9442,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"in yourself to endure the trial, there is reason and reality in some"
9443,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,degree of self-reliance. The moral advantages of such training can
9444,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"scarcely fail to amount to something; and as to the mental, that most"
9445,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"important chapter, how the lives of men are fashioned and transfused by"
9446,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"the experience of passion and the development of thought, presents new"
9447,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"sections at every turn, such as the distant dilettante's opera-glasses"
9448,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"will never detect,--to say nothing of the exercise of mere faculty,"
9449,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"which, though insensible in its daily course, leads to results of"
9450,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,immense importance.
9451,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9452,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"But the evils, the disadvantages, the dangers, how many, how imminent!"
9453,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"True, indeed, they are so. There is the early bending of the mind to the"
9454,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"production of marketable results, which must hinder all this free play"
9455,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"of intelligence, and deaden the powers that craved instruction. There is"
9456,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,the callousness produced by the sight of more misery than it is possible
9457,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"to relieve; the heart, at first so sensitive, taking refuge in a stolid"
9458,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"indifference against the pangs of sympathetic pain, it had not force to"
9459,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"bear. There is the perverting influence of uncongenial employments,"
9460,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"undertaken without or against choice, continued at unfit hours and"
9461,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"seasons, till the man loses his natural relations with summer and"
9462,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"winter, day and night, and has no sense more for natural beauty and joy."
9463,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"There is the mean providence, the perpetual caution to guard against"
9464,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"ill, instead of the generous freedom of a mind which expects good to"
9465,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,ensue from all good actions. There is the sad doubt whether it will
9466,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"_do_ to indulge the kindly impulse, the calculation of dangerous"
9467,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"chances, and the cost between the loving impulse and its fulfilment."
9468,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"Yes; there is bitter chance of narrowness, meanness, and dulness on this"
9469,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"path, and it requires great natural force, a wise and large view of life"
9470,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"taken at an early age, or fervent trust in God, to evade them."
9471,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9472,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"It is astonishing to see the poor, no less than the rich, the slaves of"
9473,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"externals. One would think that, where the rich man once became aware of"
9474,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,the worthlessness of the mere trappings of life from the weariness of a
9475,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,spirit that found itself entirely dissatisfied after pomp and
9476,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"self-indulgence, the poor man would learn this a hundred times from the"
9477,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,experience how entirely independent of them is all that is intrinsically
9478,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"valuable in our life. But, no! The poor man wants dignity, wants"
9479,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,elevation of spirit. It is his own servility that forges the fetters
9480,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"that enslave him. Whether he cringe to, or rudely defy, the man in the"
9481,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"coach and handsome coat, the cause and effect are the same. He is"
9482,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,influenced by a costume and a position. He is not firmly rooted in the
9483,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,truth that only in so far as outward beauty and grandeur are
9484,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"representative of the mind of the possessor, can they count for any"
9485,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"thing at all. O, poor man! you are poor indeed, if you feel yourself so;"
9486,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"poor if you do not feel that a soul born of God, a mind capable of"
9487,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"scanning the wondrous works of time and space, and a flexible body for"
9488,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"its service, are the essential riches of a man, and all he needs to make"
9489,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"him the equal of any other man. You are mean, if the possession of money"
9490,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,or other external advantages can make you envy or shrink from a being
9491,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"mean enough to value himself upon such. Stand where you may, O man, you"
9492,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"cannot be noble and rich if your brow be not broad and steadfast, if"
9493,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"your eye beam not with a consciousness of inward worth, of eternal"
9494,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,claims and hopes which such trifles cannot at all affect. A man without
9495,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,this majesty is ridiculous amid the flourish and decorations procured
9496,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"by money, pitiable in the faded habiliments of poverty. But a man who is"
9497,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"a man, a woman who is a woman, can never feel lessened or embarrassed"
9498,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,because others look ignorantly on such matters. If they regret the want
9499,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"of these temporary means of power, it must be solely because it fetters"
9500,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"their motions, deprives them of leisure and desired means of"
9501,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"improvement, or of benefiting those they love or pity."
9502,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9503,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,I have heard those possessed of rhetoric and imaginative tendency
9504,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"declare that they should have been outwardly great and inwardly free,"
9505,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"victorious poets and heroes, if fate had allowed them a certain quantity"
9506,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"of dollars. I have found it impossible to believe them. In early youth,"
9507,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"penury may have power to freeze the genial current of the soul, and"
9508,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"prevent it, during one short life, from becoming sensible of its true"
9509,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"vocation and destiny. But if it _has_ become conscious of these, and yet"
9510,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"there is not advance in any and all circumstances, no change would"
9511,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,avail.
9512,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9513,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"No, our poor man must begin higher! He must, in the first place, really"
9514,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,believe there is a God who ruleth--a fact to which few men vitally bear
9515,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"witness, though most are ready to affirm it with the lips."
9516,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9517,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,2. He must sincerely believe that rank and wealth
9518,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,

9537,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"that vast difference between the employments that is supposed, in the"
9538,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,means of expansion and refinement. All depends on the spirit as to the
9539,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"use that is made of an occupation. Mahomet was not a wealthy merchant,"
9540,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"and profound philosophers have ripened on the benches, not of the"
9541,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"lawyers, but the shoemakers. It did not hurt Milton to be a poor"
9542,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"schoolmaster, nor Shakspeare to do the errands of a London play-house."
9543,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"Yes, ""the mind is its own place,"" and if it will keep that place, all"
9544,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,doors will be opened from it. Upon this subject we hope to offer some
9545,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"hints at a future day, in speaking of the different trades, professions,"
9546,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,and modes of labor.
9547,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9548,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,5. Let him remember that from no man can the chief wealth be kept. On
9549,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,all men the sun and stars shine; for all the oceans swell and rivers
9550,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"flow. All men may be brothers, lovers, fathers, friends; before all lie"
9551,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,the mysteries of birth and death. If these wondrous means of wealth and
9552,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"blessing be likely to remain misused or unused, there are quite as many"
9553,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,disadvantages in the way of the man of money as of the man who has none.
9554,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,Few who drain the choicest grape know the ecstasy of bliss and knowledge
9555,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,that follows a full draught of the wine of life. That has mostly been
9556,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"reserved for those on whose thoughts society, as a public, makes but a"
9557,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"moderate claim. And if bitterness followed on the joy, if your fountain"
9558,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"was frozen after its first gush by the cold winds of the world, yet,"
9559,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"moneyless men, ye are at least not wholly ignorant of what a human being"
9560,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"has force to know. You have not skimmed over surfaces, and been dozing"
9561,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"on beds of down, during the rare and stealthy visits of Love and the"
9562,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"Muses. Remember this, and, looking round on the arrangements of the"
9563,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"lottery, see if you did not draw a prize in your turn."
9564,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,
9565,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"It will be seen that our ideal poor man needs to be religious, wise,"
9566,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"dignified, and humble, grasping at nothing, claiming all; willing to"
9567,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"wait, never willing to give up; servile to none, the servant of all, and"
9568,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"esteeming it the glory of a man to serve. The character is rare, but not"
9569,AN IDEAL SKETCH.,"unattainable. We have, however, found an approach to it more frequent in"

9578,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"During a late visit to Boston, I visited with great pleasure the Chinese"
9579,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"Museum, which has been opened there."
9580,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,
9581,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"There was much satisfaction in surveying its rich contents, if merely on"
9582,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"account of their splendor and elegance, which, though fantastic to our"
9583,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"tastes, presented an obvious standard of its own by which to prize it."
9584,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"The rich dresses of the imperial court, the magnificent jars, (the"
9585,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"largest worth three hundred dollars, and looking as if it was worth much"
9586,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"more,) the present-boxes and ivory work, the elegant interiors of the"
9587,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"home and counting-room,--all these gave pleasure by their perfection,"
9588,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,each in its kind.
9589,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,
9590,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"But the chief impression was of that unity of existence, so opposite to"
9591,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"the European, and, for a change, so pleasant, from its repose and gilded"
9592,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"lightness. Their imperial majesties do really seem so ""perfectly"
9593,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"serene,"" that we fancy we might become so under their sway, if not"
9594,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"""thoroughly virtuous,"" as they profess to be. Entirely a new mood would"
9595,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"be ours, as we should sup in one of those pleasure boats, by the light"
9596,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"of fanciful lanterns, or listen to the tinkling of pagoda bells."
9597,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,
9598,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"The highest conventional refinement, of a certain kind, is apparent in"
9599,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,all that belongs to the Chinese. The inviolability of custom has not
9600,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"made their life heavy, but shaped it to the utmost adroitness for their"
9601,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"own purposes. We are now somewhat familiar with their literature, and we"
9602,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"see pervading it a poetry subtle and aromatic, like the odors of their"
9603,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"appropriate beverage. Like that, too, it is all domestic,--never wild."
9604,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"The social genius, fluttering on the wings of compliment, pervades every"
9605,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"thing Chinese. Society has moulded them, body and soul; the youngest"
9606,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,children are more social and Chinese than human; and we doubt not the
9607,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"infant, with its first cry, shows its capacity for self-command and"
9608,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,obedience to superiors.
9609,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,
9610,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"Their great man, Confucius, expresses this social genius in its most"
9611,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,perfect state and highest form. His golden wisdom is the quintescence of
9612,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,social justice. He never forgets conditions and limits; he is admirably
9613,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"wise, pure, and religious, but never towers above humanity--never soars"
9614,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,into solitude. There is no token of the forest or cave in Confucius. Few
9615,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"men could understand him, because his nature was so thoroughly balanced,"
9616,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"and his rectitude so pure; not because his thoughts were too deep, or"
9617,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,too high for them. In him should be sought the best genius of the
9618,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"Chinese, with that perfect practical good sense whose uses are"
9619,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,universal.
9620,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,
9621,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,At one time I used to change from reading Confucius to one of the great
9622,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,religious books of another Eastern nation; and it was always like
9623,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"leaving the street and the palace for the blossoming forest of the East,"
9624,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,where in earlier times we are told the angels walked with men and
9625,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"talked, not of earth, but of heaven."
9626,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,
9627,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"As we looked at the forms moving about in the Museum, we could not"
9628,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"wonder that the Chinese consider us, who call ourselves the civilized"
9629,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"world, barbarians, so deficient were those forms in the sort of"
9630,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,refinement that the Chinese prize above all. And our people deserve it
9631,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"for their senselessness in viewing _them_ as barbarians, instead of"
9632,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,seeing how perfectly they represent their own idea. They are inferior to
9633,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"us in important developments, but, on the whole, approach far nearer"
9634,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,their own standard than we do ours. And it is wonderful that an
9635,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,enlightened European can fail to prize the sort of beauty they do
9636,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,develop. Sets of engravings we have seen representing the culture of the
9637,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"tea plant, have brought to us images of an entirely original idyllic"
9638,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,loveliness. One long resident in China has observed that nothing can be
9639,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"more enchanting than the smile of love on the regular, but otherwise"
9640,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,expressionless face of a Chinese woman. It has the simplicity and
9641,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"abandonment of infantine, with the fulness of mature feeling. It never"
9642,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"varies, but it does not tire."
9643,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,
9644,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"The same sweetness and elegance stereotyped now, but having originally a"
9645,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"deep root in their life as a race, may be seen in their poetry and"
9646,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"music. The last we have heard, both from the voice and several"
9647,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"instruments, at this Museum, for the first time, and were at first"
9648,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"tempted to laugh, when something deeper forbade. Like their poetry, the"
9649,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"music is of the narrowest monotony, a kind of rosary, a repetition of"
9650,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"phrases, and, in its enthusiasm and conventional excitement, like"
9651,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,nothing else in the heavens and on the earth. Yet both the poetry and
9652,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"music have in them an expression of birds, roses, and moonlight; indeed,"
9653,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"they suggest that state where ""moonlight, and music, and feeling are"
9654,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"one,"" though the soul seems to twitter, rather than sing of it."
9655,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,
9656,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,It is wonderful with how little practical insight travellers in China
9657,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,look on what they see. They seem to be struck by points of repulsion at
9658,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"once, and neither see nor tell us what could give any real clew to their"
9659,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"facts. I do not speak now of the recent lecturers in this city, for I"
9660,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"have not heard them; but of the many, many books into which I have"
9661,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"earlier looked with eager curiosity,--in vain,--I always found the same"
9662,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"external facts, and the same prejudices which disabled the observer from"
9663,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,piercing beneath them. I feel that I know something of the Chinese when
9664,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"reading Confucius, or looking at the figures on their tea-cups, or"
9665,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"drinking a cup of _genuine_ tea--rather an unusual felicity, it is said,"
9666,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"in this ingenious city, which shares with the Chinese one trait at"
9667,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,least. But the travellers rather take from than add to this knowledge;
9668,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,and a visit to this Museum would give more clear views than all the
9669,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,books I ever read yet.
9670,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,
9671,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"The juggling was well done, and so solemnly, with the same concentrated"
9672,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"look as the music! I saw the juggler afterwards at Ole Bull's concert,"
9673,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,and he moved not a muscle while the nightingale was pouring forth its
9674,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,sweetest descant. Probably the avenues wanted for these strains to enter
9675,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,his heart had been closed by the imperial edict long ago. The
9676,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,resemblance borne by this juggler to our Indians is even greater than we
9677,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"have seen in any other case. His brotherhood does not, to us, seem"
9678,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"surprising. Our Indians, too, are stereotyped, though in a different"
9679,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,way; they are of a mould capable of retaining the impression through
9680,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"ages; and many of the traits of the two races, or two branches of a"
9681,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"race, may seem to be identical, though so widely modified by"
9682,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"circumstances. They are all opposite to us, who have made ships, and"
9683,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"balloons, and magnetic telegraphs, as symbolic expressions of our wants,"
9684,THE CELESTIAL EMPIRE.,"and the means of gratifying them. We must console ourselves with these,"

9711,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"hesitated, and cast a sidelong glance at the mourner. Heedlessly the"

9741,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"grief, as if I knew no world beyond the grave. The joy of others seems"
9742,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"an insult, their grief a dead letter, compared with my own. Meta! Meta!"
9743,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"couldst thou see me in my hour of trial, thou wouldst disdain thy chosen"
9744,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"one!"""
9745,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],
9746,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],A strain of sweet and solemn music swelled on his ear--one of those
9747,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"majestic harmonies which, were there no other proof of the soul's"
9748,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"immortality, must suggest the image of an intellectual paradise. It"
9749,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"closed, and Meta stood before him. A long veil of silvery whiteness fell"
9750,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"over her, through which might be seen the fixed but nobly-serene"
9751,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"expression of the large blue eyes, and a holy, seraphic dignity of mien."
9752,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"Klopstock knelt before her: his soul was awed to earth. ""Hast thou"
9753,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"come, my adored!"" said he, ""from thy home of bliss, to tell me that thou"
9754,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"no longer lovest thy unworthy friend?"""
9755,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],

9759,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],my love! my husband! I come to speak consolation to thy sinking spirit.
9760,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"When you left me to breathe my last sigh in the arms of a sister, who,"
9761,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"however dear, was nothing to my heart in comparison with you, I closed"
9762,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"my eyes, wishing that the light of day might depart with thee. The"
9763,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],thought of what thou must suffer convulsed my heart with one last pang.
9764,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"Once more I murmured the wish I had so often expressed, that the sorrows"
9765,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],of the survivor might have fallen to my lot rather than to thine. In
9766,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],that pang my soul extricated itself from the body; a sensation like that
9767,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"from exquisite fragrance came over me, and with breezy lightness I rose"
9768,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"into the pure serene. It was a moment of feeling almost wild,--so free,"
9769,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],so unobscured. I had not yet passed the verge of comparison; I could not
9770,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],yet embrace the Infinite: therefore my joy was like those of
9771,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],earth--intoxicating.
9772,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],
9773,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"""Words cannot paint, even to thy eager soul, my friend, the winged"
9774,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"swiftness, the onward, glowing hopefulness of my path through the fields"
9775,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"of azure. I paused, at length, in a region of keen, pure, bluish light,"
9776,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],such as beams from Jupiter to thy planet on a lovely October evening.
9777,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],
9778,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"""Here an immediate conviction pervaded me that this was home--was my"

9780,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],the emotion excited on my first acquaintance with thy poem flowed over
9781,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],this hour; a joyous confidence in the existence of Goodness and Beauty
9782,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"supplied for a season, the want of thy society. The delicious clearness"
9783,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],of every emotion exalted my soul into a realm full of life. Some time
9784,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],elapsed in this state. The whole of my temporal existence passed in
9785,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"review before me. My thoughts, my actions, were placed in full relief"
9786,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"before the cleared eye of my spirit. Beloved, thou wilt rejoice to know"
9787,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],that thy Meta could then feel that her worst faults sprung from
9788,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"ignorance. As I was striving to connect my present state with my past,"
9789,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"and, as it were, poising myself on the brink of space and time, the"
9790,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"breath of another presence came across me, and, gradually evolving from"
9791,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"the bosom of light, a figure rose before me, in grace, in sweetness, how"
9792,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"excelling! Fixing her eyes on mine with the full gaze of love, she said,"
9793,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"in flute-like tones, 'Dost thou know me, my sister?'"
9794,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],
9795,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"""'Art thou not,' I replied, 'the love of Petrarch? I have seen the"

9803,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"I in her temporal state. I have sympathized, O wife of Klopstock! in thy"
9804,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],transitory happiness. Thy lover was thy priest and thy poet; thy model
9805,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],and oracle was thy bosom friend. All that earth could give was thine;
9806,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"and I joyed to think on thy rewarded love, thy freedom of soul, and"
9807,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"unchecked faith. Follow me now: we are to dwell in the same circle, and"

9812,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"on a slope, and overlooked a valley of exceeding beauty. It was shaded"
9813,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],by trees which had that peculiar calmness that the shadows of trees have
9814,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],below in the high noon of summer moonlight--
9815,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],

9824,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"larger and farther from us seemed, when I first looked on it, populous"
9825,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"with shapes, beauteous as that of my guide. But, when I looked more"
9826,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"fixedly, I saw only the valley, carpeted with large blue and white"
9827,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"flowers, which emitted a hyacinthine odor. Here, Laura, turning round,"
9828,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"asked, 'Is not this a poetic home, Meta?'"

9830,KLOPSTOCK AND META.[36],"""I paused a moment ere I replied, 'It is indeed a place of beauty, but"

9918,A FABLE.,"""Don't tell me,"" says another; ""brown is entirely different from black."
9919,A FABLE.,I like brown very well; there is Oriental precedent for its
9920,A FABLE.,"respectability. Perhaps we will use some of your chestnuts, if we can"
9921,A FABLE.,"get fine samples. But for the present, I think we should use only"
9922,A FABLE.,"English walnuts, such as our forefathers delighted to honor. Here are"

9932,A FABLE.,At that moment two persons entered the council of a darker complexion
9933,A FABLE.,"than most of those present, as if born beneath the glow of a more"

9936,A FABLE.,mingled with infinite sweetness. She looked at the assembly with an air
9937,A FABLE.,"of surprise, as if its aspect was strange to her. She threw quite back"
9938,A FABLE.,"her veil, and stepping aside, made room for her companion. His form was"
9939,A FABLE.,"youthful, about the age of one we have seen in many a picture produced"
9940,A FABLE.,"by the thought of eighteen centuries, as of one ""instructing the"

9950,A FABLE.,"""I came hither,"" said he, ""an uninvited guest, because I read sculptured"

9990,A FABLE.,"known me?"" And the woman turned from them the majestic hope of her"
9991,A FABLE.,"glance, and both forms suddenly vanished; but the banner was left"
9992,A FABLE.,trailing in the dust.
9993,A FABLE.,
9994,A FABLE.,"The men stood gazing at one another. After which one mounted on high,"
9995,A FABLE.,"and said, ""Perhaps, my friends, we carry too far this aversion to"
9996,A FABLE.,"objects merely because they are black. I heard, the other day, a wise"
9997,A FABLE.,"man say that black was the color of evil--marked as such by God, and"
9998,A FABLE.,that whenever a white man struck a black man he did an act of worship
9999,A FABLE.,"to God.[37] I could not quite believe him. I hope, in what I am about to"
10000,A FABLE.,"add, I shall not be misunderstood. I am no abolitionist. I respect above"
10001,A FABLE.,"all things, divine or human, the constitution framed by our forefathers,"
10002,A FABLE.,and the peculiar institutions hallowed by the usage of their sons. I
10003,A FABLE.,have no sympathy with the black race in this country. I wish it to be
10004,A FABLE.,understood that I feel towards negroes the purest personal antipathy. It
10005,A FABLE.,"is a family trait with us. My little son, scarce able to speak, will cry"
10006,A FABLE.,"out, 'Nigger! Nigger!' whenever he sees one, and try to throw things at"
10007,A FABLE.,them. He made a whole omnibus load laugh the other day by his cunning
10008,A FABLE.,"way of doing this.[38] The child of my political antagonist, on the"
10009,A FABLE.,"other hand, says 'he likes _tullared_ children the best.'[39] You see he"
10010,A FABLE.,"is tainted in his cradle by the loose principles of his parents, even"
10011,A FABLE.,"before he can say nigger, or pronounce the more refined appellation. But"
10012,A FABLE.,that is no matter. I merely mention this by the way; not to prejudice
10013,A FABLE.,"you against Mr.----, but that you may appreciate the very different"
10014,A FABLE.,"state of things in my family, and not misinterpret what I have to say. I"
10015,A FABLE.,was lately in one of our prisons where a somewhat injudicious indulgence
10016,A FABLE.,"had extended to one of the condemned felons, a lost and wretched outcast"
10017,A FABLE.,"from society, the use of materials for painting, that having been his"
10018,A FABLE.,profession. He had completed at his leisure a picture of the Lord's
10019,A FABLE.,"Supper. Most of the figures were well enough, but Judas he had"
10020,A FABLE.,"represented as a black.[40] Now, gentlemen, I am of opinion that this is"
10021,A FABLE.,"an unwarrantable liberty taken with the Holy Scriptures, and shows _too"
10022,A FABLE.,"much_ prejudice in the community. It is my wish to be moderate and fair,"
10023,A FABLE.,"and preserve a medium, neither, on the one hand, yielding the wholesome"
10024,A FABLE.,"antipathies planted in our breasts as a safeguard against degradation,"
10025,A FABLE.,"and our constitutional obligations, which, as I have before observed,"
10026,A FABLE.,"are, with me, more binding than any other; nor, on the other hand,"
10027,A FABLE.,forgetting that liberality and wisdom which are the prerogative of every
10028,A FABLE.,"citizen of this free commonwealth. I agree, then, with our young"
10029,A FABLE.,"visitor. I hardly know, indeed, why a stranger, and one so young, was"
10030,A FABLE.,permitted to mingle in this council; but it was certainly thoughtful in
10031,A FABLE.,him to crack and examine the nuts. I agree that it may be well to plant
10032,A FABLE.,"some of the black nuts among the others, so that, if many of the walnuts"

10232,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,The meeting on Monday night at the Tabernacle was to us an occasion of
10233,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"deep and peculiar interest. It was deep, for the feelings there"
10234,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"expressed and answered bore witness to the truth of our belief, that the"
10235,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"sense of right is not dead, but only sleepeth in this nation. A man who"
10236,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"is manly enough to appeal to it, will be answered, in feeling at least,"
10237,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"if not in action, and while there is life there is hope. Those who so"
10238,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"rapturously welcomed one who had sealed his faith by deeds of devotion,"
10239,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,must yet acknowledge in their breasts the germs of like nobleness.
10240,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,
10241,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"It was an occasion of peculiar interest, such as we have not had"
10242,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"occasion to feel since, in childish years, we saw Lafayette welcomed by"
10243,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,a grateful people. Even childhood well understood that the gratitude
10244,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,then expressed was not so much for the aid which had been received as
10245,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,for the motives and feelings with which it was given. The nation rushed
10246,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"out as one man to thank Lafayette, that he had been able, amid the"
10247,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"prejudices and indulgences of high rank in the old _régime_ of society,"
10248,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,to understand the great principles which were about to create a new
10249,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"form, and answer, manlike, with love, service, and contempt of selfish"
10250,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,interests to the voice of humanity demanding its rights. Our freedom
10251,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,would have been achieved without Lafayette; but it was a happiness and a
10252,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,blessing to number the young French nobleman as the champion of American
10253,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"independence, and to know that he had given the prime of his life to our"
10254,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"cause, because it was the cause of justice. With similar feelings of"
10255,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"joy, pride, and hope, we welcome Cassius M. Clay, a man who has, in like"
10256,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"manner, freed himself from the prejudices of his position, disregarded"
10257,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"selfish considerations, and quitting the easy path in which he might"
10258,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"have walked to station in the sight of men, and such external"
10259,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,distinctions as his State and nation readily confer on men so born and
10260,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"bred, and with such abilities, chose rather an interest in their souls,"
10261,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,and the honors history will not fail to award to the man who enrolls his
10262,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,name and elevates his life for the cause of right and those universal
10263,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,principles whose recognition can alone secure to man the destiny without
10264,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"which he cannot be happy, but which he is continually sacrificing for"
10265,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"the impure worship of idols. Yea, in this country, more than in the old"
10266,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"Palestine, do they give their children to the fire in honor of Moloch,"
10267,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,and sell the ark confided to them by the Most High for shekels of gold
10268,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,and of silver. Partly it was the sense of this position which Mr. Clay
10269,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"holds, as a man who esteems his own individual convictions of right more"
10270,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"than local interests or partial, political schemes, that gave him such"
10271,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,an enthusiastic welcome on Monday night from the very hearts of the
10272,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"audience, but still more that his honor is at this moment identified"
10273,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"with the liberty of the press, which has been insulted and infringed in"
10274,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,him. About this there can be in fact but one opinion. In vain Kentucky
10275,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"calls meetings, states reasons, gives names of her own to what has been"
10276,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"done.[41] The rest of the world knows very well what the action is, and"
10277,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,will call it by but one name. Regardless of this ostrich mode of
10278,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"defence, the world has laughed and scoffed at the act of a people"
10279,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"professing to be free and defenders of freedom, and the recording angel"
10280,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"has written down the deed as a lawless act of violence and tyranny, from"
10281,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,which the man is happy who can call himself pure.
10282,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,

10288,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"Whoever saw Mr. Clay that night, saw in him a man of deep and strong"
10289,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"nature, thoroughly in earnest, who had well considered his ground, and"
10290,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"saw that though open, as the truly _noble_ must be, to new views and"
10291,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"convictions, yet his direction is taken, and the improvement to be made"
10292,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"will not be to turn aside, but to expedite and widen his course in that"
10293,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"direction. Mr. Clay is young, young enough, thank Heaven! to promise a"

10295,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"who esteem youth an unpardonable fault, and one that renders incapable"
10296,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"of counsel, we would say that he is at the age when a man is capable of"
10297,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"great thoughts and great deeds, if ever. His is not a character that"
10298,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,will ever grow old; it is not capable of a petty and short-sighted
10299,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"prudence, but can only be guided by a large wisdom which is more young"
10300,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"than old, for it has within itself the springs of perpetual youth, and"
10301,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"which, being far-sighted and prophetical, joins ever with the progress"
10302,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,party without waiting till it be obviously in the ascendant.

10304,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"Mr. Clay has eloquence, but only from the soul. He does not possess the"
10305,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"art of oratory, as an art. Before he gets warmed he is too slow, and"
10306,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"breaks his sentences too much. His transitions are not made with skill,"
10307,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"nor is the structure of his speech, as a whole, symmetrical; yet,"
10308,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"throughout, his grasp is firm upon his subject, and all the words are"
10309,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,laden with the electricity of a strong mind and generous nature. When he
10310,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"begins to glow, and his deep mellow eye fills with light, the speech"
10311,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"melts and glows too, and he is able to impress upon the hearer the full"
10312,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"effect of firm conviction, conceived with impassioned energy. His often"
10313,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"rugged and harsh emphasis flashes and sparkles then, and we feel that"
10314,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"there is in the furnace a stream of iron: iron, fortress of the nations"
10315,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"and victor of the seas, worth far more, in stress of storm, than all the"
10316,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,gold and gems of rhetoric.
10317,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,
10318,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"The great principle that he who wrongs one wrongs all, and that no part"
10319,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"can be wounded without endangering the whole, was the healthy root of"
10320,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,Mr. Clay's speech. The report does not do justice to the turn of
10321,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"expression in some parts which were most characteristic. These, indeed,"
10322,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,depended much on the tones and looks of the speaker. We should speak of
10323,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"them as full of a robust and homely sincerity, dignified by the heart of"
10324,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"the gentleman, a heart too secure of its respect for the rights of"
10325,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,others to need any of the usual interpositions. His good-humored
10326,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"sarcasm, on occasion of several vulgar interruptions, was very pleasant,"
10327,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,and easily at those times might be recognized in him the man of heroical
10328,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"nature, who can only show himself adequately in time of interruption and"
10329,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"of obstacle. If that be all that is wanted, we shall surely see him"
10330,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,wholly; there will be no lack of American occasions to call out the
10331,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"Greek fire. We want them all--the Grecian men, who feel a godlike thirst"
10332,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"for immortal glory, and to develop the peculiar powers with which the"
10333,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"gods have gifted them. We want them all--the poet, the thinker, the"
10334,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"hero. Whether our heroes need _swords_, is a more doubtful point, we"
10335,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"think, than Mr. Clay believes. Neither do we believe in some of the"
10336,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"means he proposes to further his aims. God uses all kinds of means, but"
10337,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"men, his priests, must keep their hands pure. Nobody that needs a bribe"
10338,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,shall be asked to further our schemes for emancipation. But there is
10339,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,room enough and time enough to think out these points till all is in
10340,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,harmony. For the good that has been done and the truth that has been
10341,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"spoken, for the love of such that has been seen in this great city"
10342,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,"struggling up through the love of money, we should to-day be"
10343,CASSIUS M. CLAY.,thankful--and we are so.

10351,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"The stars tell all their secrets to the flowers, and, if we only knew"
10352,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"how to look around us, we should not need to look above. But man is a"
10353,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"plant of slow growth, and great heat is required to bring out his"
10354,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"leaves. He must be promised a boundless futurity, to induce him to use"
10355,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"aright the present hour. In youth, fixing his eyes on those distant"
10356,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"worlds of light, he promises himself to attain them, and there find the"
10357,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"answer to all his wishes. His eye grows keener as he gazes, a voice from"
10358,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"the earth calls it downward, and he finds all at his feet."
10359,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,
10360,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"I was riding on the shore of Lake Pontchartrain, musing on an old"
10361,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"English expression, which I had only lately learned to interpret. ""He"
10362,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"was fulfilled of all nobleness."" Words so significant charm us like a"
10363,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"spell, long before we know their meaning. This I had now learned to"
10364,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"interpret. Life had ripened from the green bud, and I had seen the"
10365,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"difference, wide as from earth to heaven, between nobleness and the"
10366,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,_fulfilment_ of nobleness.
10367,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,
10368,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,A fragrance beyond any thing I had ever known came suddenly upon the
10369,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"air, and interrupted my meditation. I looked around me, but saw no"
10370,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,flower from which it could proceed. There is no word for it; _exquisite_
10371,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,and _delicious_ have lost all meaning now. It was of a full and
10372,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"penetrating sweetness, too keen and delicate to be cloying. Unable to"
10373,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"trace it, I rode on, but the remembrance of it pursued me. I had a"
10374,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"feeling that I must forever regret my loss, my want, if I did not return"
10375,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"and find the poet of the lake, whose voice was such perfume. In earlier"
10376,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"days, I might have disregarded such a feeling; but now I have learned"
10377,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"to prize the monitions of my nature as they deserve, and learn sometimes"
10378,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"what is not for sale in the market place. So I turned back, and rode to"
10379,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"and fro, at the risk of abandoning the object of my ride."
10380,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,
10381,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"I found her at last, the queen of the south, singing to herself in her"
10382,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"lonely bower. Such should a sovereign be, most regal when alone; for"
10383,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,then there is no disturbance to prevent the full consciousness of power.
10384,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,All occasions limit; a kingdom is but an occasion; and no sun ever saw
10385,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,itself adequately reflected on sea or land.
10386,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,
10387,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,Nothing at the south had affected me like the magnolia. Sickness and
10388,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"sorrow, which have separated me from my kind, have requited my loss by"
10389,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,making known to me the loveliest dialect of the divine language.
10390,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"""Flowers,"" it has been truly said, ""are the only positive present made"
10391,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"us by nature."" Man has not been ungrateful, but consecrated the gift to"
10392,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"adorn the darkest and brightest hours. If it is ever perverted, it is to"
10393,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,be used as a medicine; and even this vexes me. But no matter for that.
10394,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,We have pure intercourse with these purest creations; we love them for
10395,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"their own sake, for their beauty's sake. As we grow beautiful and pure,"
10396,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"we understand them better. With me knowledge of them is a circumstance,"
10397,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"a habit of my life, rather than a merit. I have lived with them, and"
10398,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"with them almost alone, till I have learned to interpret the slightest"
10399,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,signs by which they manifest their fair thoughts. There is not a flower
10400,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"in my native region which has not for me a tale, to which every year is"
10401,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,adding new incidents; yet the growths of this new climate brought me new
10402,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"and sweet emotions, and, above all others, was the magnolia a"
10403,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"revelation. When I first beheld her, a stately tower of verdure, each"
10404,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"cup, an imperial vestal, full-displayed to the eye of day, yet guarded"
10405,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,from the too hasty touch even of the wind by its graceful decorums of
10406,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"firm, glistening, broad, green leaves, I stood astonished, as might a"
10407,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"lover of music, who, after hearing in all his youth only the harp or"
10408,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"the bugle, should be saluted, on entering some vast cathedral, by the"
10409,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,full peal of its organ.
10410,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,
10411,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"After I had recovered from my first surprise, I became acquainted with"
10412,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"the flower, and found all its life in harmony. Its fragrance, less"
10413,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"enchanting than that of the rose, excited a pleasure more full of life,"
10414,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"and which could longer be enjoyed without satiety. Its blossoms, if"
10415,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"plucked from their home, refused to retain their dazzling hue, but"
10416,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"drooped and grew sallow, like princesses captive in the prison of a"
10417,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,barbarous foe.
10418,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,
10419,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,But there was something quite peculiar in the fragrance of this tree; so
10420,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"much so, that I had not at first recognized the magnolia. Thinking it"
10421,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"must be of a species I had never yet seen, I alighted, and leaving my"
10422,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"horse, drew near to question it with eyes of reverent love."
10423,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,
10424,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"""Be not surprised,"" replied those lips of untouched purity, ""stranger,"
10425,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,who alone hast known to hear in my voice a tone more deep and full than
10426,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"that of my beautiful sisters. Sit down, and listen to my tale, nor fear"
10427,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"that I will overpower thee by too much sweetness. I am, indeed, of the"
10428,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"race you love, but in it I stand alone. In my family I have no sister of"
10429,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"the heart, and though my root is the same as that of the other virgins"
10430,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"of our royal house, I bear not the same blossom, nor can I unite my"
10431,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"voice with theirs in the forest choir. Therefore I dwell here alone, nor"
10432,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,did I ever expect to tell the secret of my loneliness. But to all that
10433,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"ask there is an answer, and I speak to thee."
10434,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,
10435,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"""Indeed, we have met before, as that secret feeling of home, which makes"
10436,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"delight so tender, must inform thee. The spirit that I utter once"
10437,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,inhabited the glory of the most glorious climates. I dwelt once in the
10438,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"orange tree."""
10439,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,
10440,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"""Ah?"" said I; ""then I did not mistake. It is the same voice I heard in"
10441,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,the saddest season of my youth. I stood one evening on a high terrace in
10442,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"another land, the land where 'the plant man has grown to greatest size.'"
10443,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,It was an evening whose unrivalled splendor demanded perfection in
10444,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,man--answering to that he found in nature--a sky 'black-blue' deep as
10445,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"eternity, stars of holiest hope, a breeze promising rapture in every"
10446,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,breath. I could not longer endure this discord between myself and such
10447,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"beauty; I retired within my window, and lit the lamp. Its rays fell on"
10448,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"an orange tree, full clad in its golden fruit and bridal blossoms. How"
10449,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"did we talk together then, fairest friend! Thou didst tell me all; and"
10450,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"yet thou knowest, that even then, had I asked any part of thy dower, it"
10451,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"would have been to bear the sweet fruit, rather than the sweeter"
10452,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,blossoms. My wish had been expressed by another.
10453,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,
10454,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"'O, that I were an orange tree,"
10455,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,That busy plant!
10456,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"Then should I ever laden he,"
10457,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,And never want
10458,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,Some fruit for him that dresseth me.'
10459,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,
10460,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"Thou didst seem to me the happiest of all spirits in wealth of nature,"
10461,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,in fulness of utterance. How is it that I find thee now in another
10462,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"habitation?"""
10463,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,
10464,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"""How is it, man, that thou art now content that thy life bears no golden"
10465,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"fruit?"""
10466,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,
10467,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"""It is,"" I replied, ""that I have at last, through privation, been"
10468,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"initiated into the secret of peace. Blighted without, unable to find"
10469,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"myself in other forms of nature, I was driven back upon the centre of my"
10470,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"being, and there found all being. For the wise, the obedient child from"
10471,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"one point can draw all lines, and in one germ read all the possible"
10472,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"disclosures of successive life."""
10473,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,
10474,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"""Even so,"" replied the flower, ""and ever for that reason am I trying to"
10475,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,simplify my being. How happy I was in the 'spirit's dower when first it
10476,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"was wed,' I told thee in that earlier day. But after a while I grew"
10477,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"weary of that fulness of speech; I felt a shame at telling all I knew,"
10478,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"and challenging all sympathies; I was never silent, I was never alone;"
10479,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"I had a voice for every season, for day and night; on me the merchant"
10480,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"counted, the bride looked to me for her garland, the nobleman for the"
10481,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"chief ornament of his princely hair, and the poor man for his wealth;"
10482,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"all sang my praises, all extolled my beauty, all blessed my beneficence;"
10483,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"and, for a while, my heart swelled with pride and pleasure. But, as"
10484,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"years passed, my mood changed. The lonely moon rebuked me, as she hid"
10485,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"from the wishes of man, nor would return till her due change was passed."
10486,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,The inaccessible sun looked on me with the same ray as on all others; my
10487,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,endless profusion could not bribe him to one smile sacred to me alone.
10488,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"The mysterious wind passed me by to tell its secret to the solemn pine,"
10489,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"and the nightingale sang to the rose rather than me, though she was"
10490,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"often silent, and buried herself yearly in the dark earth."
10491,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,
10492,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"""I knew no mine or thine: I belonged to all. I could never rest: I was"
10493,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"never at one. Painfully I felt this want, and from every blossom sighed"
10494,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,entreaties for some being to come and satisfy it. With every bud I
10495,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"implored an answer, but each bud only produced an orange."
10496,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,
10497,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"""At last this feeling grew more painful, and thrilled my very root. The"
10498,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,earth trembled at the touch with a pulse so sympathetic that ever and
10499,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"anon it seemed, could I but retire and hide in that silent bosom for one"
10500,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"calm winter, all would be told me, and tranquillity, deep as my desire,"
10501,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"be mine. But the law of my being was on me, and man and nature seconded"
10502,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,it. Ceaselessly they called on me for my beautiful gifts; they decked
10503,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"themselves with them, nor cared to know the saddened heart of the giver."
10504,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"O, how cruel they seemed at last, as they visited and despoiled me, yet"
10505,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"never sought to aid me, or even paused to think that I might need their"
10506,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,aid! yet I would not hate them. I saw it was my seeming riches that
10507,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,bereft me of sympathy. I saw they could not know what was hid beneath
10508,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"the perpetual veil of glowing life. I ceased to expect aught from them,"
10509,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"and turned my eyes to the distant stars. I thought, could I but hoard"
10510,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"from the daily expenditure of my juices till I grew tall enough, I might"
10511,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"reach those distant spheres, which looked so silent and consecrated,"
10512,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"and there pause a while from these weary joys of endless life, and in"
10513,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,the lap of winter find my spring.
10514,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,
10515,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"""But not so was my hope to be fulfilled. One starlight night I was"
10516,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"looking, hoping, when a sudden breeze came up. It touched me, I thought,"
10517,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"as if it were a cold, white beam from those stranger worlds. The cold"
10518,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"gained upon my heart; every blossom trembled, every leaf grew brittle,"
10519,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,and the fruit began to seem unconnected with the stem; soon I lost all
10520,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"feeling; and morning found the pride of the garden black, stiff, and"
10521,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,powerless.
10522,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,
10523,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"""As the rays of the morning sun touched me, consciousness returned, and"
10524,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"I strove to speak, but in vain. Sealed were my fountains, and all my"
10525,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"heartbeats still. I felt that I had been that beauteous tree, but now"
10526,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"only was--what--I knew not; yet I was, and the voices of men said, It is"
10527,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"dead; cast it forth, and plant another in the costly vase. A mystic"
10528,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,shudder of pale joy then separated me wholly from my former abode.
10529,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,
10530,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"""A moment more, and I was before the queen and guardian of the flowers."
10531,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,Of this being I cannot speak to thee in any language now possible
10532,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"betwixt us; for this is a being of another order from thee, an order"
10533,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"whose presence thou mayst feel, nay, approach step by step, but which"
10534,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"cannot be known till thou art of it, nor seen nor spoken of till thou"

10536,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,
10537,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"""Suffice it to say, that it is not such a being as men love to paint; a"
10538,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"fairy, like them, only lesser and more exquisite than they; a goddess,"
10539,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"larger and of statelier proportion; an angel, like still, only with an"
10540,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,added power. Man never creates; he only recombines the lines and colors
10541,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,of his own existence: only a deific fancy could evolve from the elements
10542,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,the form that took me home.

10544,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"""Secret, radiant, profound ever, and never to be known, was she; many"

10568,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,with somewhat of my former exuberance and over-ready tenderness to the

10570,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,and more capable of retirement into my own heart. Nor shall I again

10572,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,"myself to be questioned by an alien spirit, to tell the tale of my being"

10574,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,that nothing strange can meet me more. I have atoned by confession;
10575,THE MAGNOLIA OF LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.,further penance needs not; and I feel the Infinite possess me more and

10609,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,that religious sentiment from which they originally sprung? In the old
10610,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"world the history of such edifices, though not without its shadow, had"
10611,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,many bright lines. Kings and emperors paid oftentimes for the materials
10612,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"and labor a price of blood and plunder, and many a wretched sinner"
10613,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,sought by contributions of stone for their walls to roll off the burden
10614,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,he had laid on his conscience. Still the community amid which they rose
10615,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,knew little of these drawbacks. Pious legends attest the purity of
10616,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,feeling associated with each circumstance of their building. Mysterious
10617,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"orders, of which we know only that they were consecrated to brotherly"
10618,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"love and the development of mind, produced the genius which animated the"
10619,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,architecture; but the casting of the bells and suspending them in the
10620,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,tower was an act in which all orders of the community took part; for
10621,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"when those cathedrals were consecrated, it was for the use of all. Rich"

10633,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,
10634,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,We must confess this circumstance is to us quite destructive of

10636,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,
10637,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"We are told, that at the late consecration, the claims of the poor were"

10639,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"chapel, to atone for the luxury which shuts them out from the reflection"
10640,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,of sunshine through those brilliant windows. It is certainly better that
10641,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,they should be offered the crumbs from the rich man's table than nothing
10642,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"at all, yet it is surely not _the_ way that Jesus would have taught to"
10643,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,provide for the poor.
10644,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,
10645,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,Would we not then have these splendid edifices erected? We certainly
10646,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,feel that the educational influence of good specimens of architecture
10647,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,(and we know no other argument in their favor) is far from being a
10648,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,counterpoise to the abstraction of so much money from purposes that
10649,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,would be more in fulfilment of that Christian idea which these assume to
10650,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"represent Were the rich to build such a church, and, dispensing with"
10651,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"pews and all exclusive advantages, invite all who would to come in to"
10652,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"the banquet, that were, indeed, noble and Christian. And, though we"
10653,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"believe more, for our nation and time, in intellectual monuments than"
10654,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"those of wood and stone, and, in opposition even to our admired Powers,"
10655,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,think that Michael Angelo himself could have advised no more suitable
10656,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,monument to Washington than a house devoted to the instruction of the
10657,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"people, and think that great master, and the Greeks no less, would agree"
10658,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"with us if they lived now to survey all the bearings of the subject, yet"
10659,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"we would not object to these splendid churches, if the idea of Him they"
10660,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"call Master were represented in them. But till it is, they can do no"
10661,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"good, for the means are not in harmony with the end. The rich man sits"
10662,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"in state while ""near two hundred thousand"" Lazaruses linger, unprovided"
10663,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"for, without the gate. While this is so, they must not talk much,"
10664,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"within, of Jesus of Nazareth, who called to him fishermen, laborers, and"
10665,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"artisans, for his companions and disciples."
10666,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,
10667,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"We find some excellent remarks on this subject from Rev. Stephen Olin,"
10668,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,president of the Wesleyan University. They are appended as a note to a
10669,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"discourse addressed to young men, on the text, ""Put ye on the Lord Jesus"
10670,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts"
10671,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"thereof."""
10672,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,
10673,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"This discourse, though it discloses formal and external views of"
10674,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"religions ties and obligations, is dignified by a fervent, generous love"
10675,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"for men, and a more than commonly catholic liberality; and though these"
10676,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"remarks are made and meant to bear upon the interests of his own sect,"
10677,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"yet they are anti-sectarian in their tendency, and worthy the"
10678,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,consideration of all anxious to understand the call of duty in these
10679,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,matters. Earnest attention of this sort will better avail than fifteen
10680,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"hundred dollars, or more, paid for a post of exhibition in a fashionable"
10681,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"church, where, if piety be provided with one chance, worldliness has"
10682,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,twenty to stare it out of countenance.
10683,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,
10684,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"""The strong tendency in our religious operations to gather the rich and"
10685,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"the poor into separate folds, and so to generate and establish in the"
10686,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,church distinctions utterly at variance with the spirit of our political
10687,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"institutions, is the very worst result of the multiplication of sects"
10688,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,among us; and I fear it must be admitted that the evil is greatly
10689,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,aggravated by the otherwise benignant working of the voluntary system.
10690,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,Without insisting further upon the probable or possible injury which may
10691,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"befall our free country from this conflict of agencies, ever the most"
10692,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"powerful in the formation of national and individual character, no one,"
10693,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"I am sure, can fail to recognize in this development an influence"
10694,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,utterly and irreconcilably hostile to the genius and cherished objects
10695,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"of Christianity. It is the peculiar glory of the gospel that, even under"
10696,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"the most arbitrary governments, it has usually been able to vindicate"
10697,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,and practically exemplify the essential equality of man. It has had one
10698,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,doctrine and one hope for all its children; and the highest and the
10699,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,lowest have been constrained to acknowledge one holy law of brotherhood
10700,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"in the common faith of which they are made partakers. Nowhere else, I"
10701,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"believe, but in the United States--certainly nowhere else to the same"
10702,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,extent--does this anti-Christian separation of classes prevail in the
10703,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,Christian church. The beggar in his tattered vestments walks the
10704,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"splendid courts of St. Peter's, and kneels at its costly altars by the"
10705,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,side of dukes and cardinals. The peasant in his wooden shoes is welcomed
10706,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,in the gorgeous churches of Notre Dame and the Madeleine; and even in
10707,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"England, where political and social distinctions are more rigorously"
10708,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"enforced than in any other country on earth, the lord and the peasant,"
10709,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"the richest and the poorest, are usually occupants of the same church,"
10710,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,and partakers of the same communion. That the reverse of all this is
10711,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"true in many parts of this country, every observing man knows full well;"
10712,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"and what is yet more deplorable, while the lines of demarcation between"
10713,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"the different classes have already become sufficiently distinct, the"
10714,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,tendency is receiving new strength and development in a rapidly
10715,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"augmenting ratio. Even in country places, where the population is"
10716,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"sparse, and the artificial distinctions of society are little known, the"
10717,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"working of this strange element is, in many instances, made manifest,"
10718,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,and a petty coterie of village magnates may be found worshipping God
10719,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"apart from the body of the people. But the evil is much more apparent,"
10720,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"as well as more deeply seated, in our populous towns, where the causes"
10721,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"which produce it have been longer in operation, and have more fully"
10722,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"enjoyed the favor of circumstances. In these great centres of wealth,"
10723,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"intelligence, and influence, the separation between the classes is, in"
10724,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"many instances, complete, and in many more the process is rapidly"
10725,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,progressive.
10726,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,
10727,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"""There are crowded religious congregations composed so exclusively of"
10728,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,the wealthy as scarcely to embrace an indigent family or individual; and
10729,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"the number of such churches, where the gospel is never preached to the"
10730,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"poor, is constantly increasing. Rich men, instead of associating"
10731,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"themselves with their more humble fellow-Christians, where their money"
10732,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"as well as their influence and counsels are so much needed, usually"
10733,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"combine to erect magnificent churches, in which sittings are too"
10734,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"expensive for any but people of fortune, and from which their"
10735,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,less-favored brethren are as effectually and peremptorily excluded as if
10736,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,there were dishonor or contagion in their presence. A congregation is
10737,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"thus constituted, able, without the slightest inconvenience, to bear the"
10738,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"pecuniary burdens of twenty churches, monopolizing and consigning to"
10739,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"comparative inactivity intellectual, moral, and material resources, for"
10740,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,want of which so many other congregations are doomed to struggle with
10741,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,the most embarrassing difficulties. Can it for a moment be thought that
10742,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"such a state of things is desirable, or in harmony with the spirit and"
10743,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,design of the gospel?
10744,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,
10745,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"""A more difficult question arises when we inquire after a remedy for"
10746,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"evils too glaring to be overlooked, and too grave to be tolerated,"
10747,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"without an effort to palliate, if not to remove them. The most obvious"
10748,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"palliative, and one which has already been tried to some extent by"
10749,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"wealthy churches or individuals, is the erection of free places of"
10750,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,worship for the poor. Such a provision for this class of persons would
10751,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,be more effectual in any other part of the world than in the United
10752,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"States. Whether it arises from the operation of our political system, or"
10753,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"from the easy attainment of at least the prime necessaries of life, the"
10754,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"poorer classes here are characterized by a proud spirit, which will not"
10755,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,submit to receive even the highest benefits in any form that implies
10756,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,inferiority or dependence. This strong and prevalent feeling must
10757,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,continue to interpose serious obstacles in the way of these laudable
10758,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,attempts. If in a few instances churches for the poor have succeeded in
10759,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"our large cities, where the theory of social equality is so imperfectly"
10760,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"realized in the actual condition of the people, and where the presence"
10761,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,of a multitude of indigent foreigners tends to lower the sentiment of
10762,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"independence so strong in native-born Americans, the system is yet"
10763,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,manifestly incapable of general application to the religious wants of
10764,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,our population. The same difficulty usually occurs in all attempts to
10765,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,induce the humbler classes to worship with the rich in sumptuous
10766,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"churches, by reserving for their benefit a portion of the sittings free,"
10767,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,or at a nominal rent. A few only can be found who are willing to be
10768,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"recognized and provided for as beneficiaries and paupers, while the"
10769,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,multitude will always prefer to make great sacrifices in order to
10770,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,provide for themselves in some humbler fane. It must be admitted that
10771,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"this subject is beset with practical difficulties, which are not likely"
10772,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"to be removed speedily, or without some great and improbable revolution"
10773,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,in our religious affairs. Yet if the respectable Christian denominations
10774,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,most concerned in the subject shall pursue a wise and liberal policy for
10775,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"the future, something may be done to check the evil. They may retard its"
10776,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"rapid growth, perhaps, though it will most likely be found impossible to"
10777,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"eradicate it altogether. It ought to be well understood, that the"
10778,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,multiplication of magnificent churches is daily making the line of
10779,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,demarcation between the rich and the poor more and more palpable and
10780,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,impassable. There are many good reasons for the erection of such
10781,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,edifices. Increasing wealth and civilization seem to call for a liberal
10782,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,and tasteful outlay in behalf of religion; yet is it the dictate of
10783,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,prudence no less than of duty to balance carefully the good and the evil
10784,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"of every enterprise. It should ever be kept in mind, that such a church"
10785,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,virtually writes above its sculptured portals an irrevocable prohibition
10786,CONSECRATION OF GRACE CHURCH.,"to the poor--'_Procul, O procul este profani_.'"""

11095,FAREWELL.[43],
11096,FAREWELL.[43],
11097,FAREWELL.[43],"Farewell to New York city, where twenty months have presented me with a"
11098,FAREWELL.[43],"richer and more varied exercise for thought and life, than twenty years"
11099,FAREWELL.[43],could in any other part of these United States.
11100,FAREWELL.[43],
11101,FAREWELL.[43],"It is the common remark about New York, that it has at least nothing"
11102,FAREWELL.[43],petty or provincial in its methods and habits. The place is large
11103,FAREWELL.[43],"enough: there is room enough, and occupation enough, for men to have no"
11104,FAREWELL.[43],need or excuse for small cavils or scrutinies. A person who is
11105,FAREWELL.[43],"independent, and knows what he wants, may lead his proper life here,"
11106,FAREWELL.[43],unimpeded by others.
11107,FAREWELL.[43],
11108,FAREWELL.[43],"Vice and crime, if flagrant and frequent, are less thickly coated by"
11109,FAREWELL.[43],hypocrisy than elsewhere. The air comes sometimes to the most infected
11110,FAREWELL.[43],subjects.
11111,FAREWELL.[43],
11112,FAREWELL.[43],"New York is the focus, the point where American and European interests"
11113,FAREWELL.[43],"converge. There is no topic of general interest to men, that will not"
11114,FAREWELL.[43],betimes be brought before the thinker by the quick turning of the wheel.
11115,FAREWELL.[43],
11116,FAREWELL.[43],"_Too_ quick that revolution,--some object. Life rushes wide and free,"
11117,FAREWELL.[43],but _too fast_. Yet it is in the power of every one to avert from
11118,FAREWELL.[43],"himself the evil that accompanies the good. He must build for his study,"
11119,FAREWELL.[43],"as did the German poet, a house beneath the bridge; and then all that"
11120,FAREWELL.[43],"passes above and by him will be heard and seen, but he will not be"
11121,FAREWELL.[43],carried away with it.
11122,FAREWELL.[43],
11123,FAREWELL.[43],"Earlier views have been confirmed, and many new ones opened. On two"
11124,FAREWELL.[43],"great leadings, the superlative importance of promoting national"
11125,FAREWELL.[43],education by heightening and deepening the cultivation of individual
11126,FAREWELL.[43],"minds, and the part which is assigned to woman in the next stage of"
11127,FAREWELL.[43],"human progress in this country, where most important achievements are to"
11128,FAREWELL.[43],"be effected, I have received much encouragement, much instruction, and"
11129,FAREWELL.[43],the fairest hopes of more.
11130,FAREWELL.[43],
11131,FAREWELL.[43],"On various subjects of minor importance, no less than these, I hope for"
11132,FAREWELL.[43],"good results, from observation, with my own eyes, of life in the old"
11133,FAREWELL.[43],"world, and to bring home some packages of seed for life in the new."
11134,FAREWELL.[43],
11135,FAREWELL.[43],"These words I address to my friends, for I feel that I have some. The"
11136,FAREWELL.[43],degree of sympathetic response to the thoughts and suggestions I have
11137,FAREWELL.[43],"offered through the columns of the Tribune, has indeed surprised me,"
11138,FAREWELL.[43],"conscious as I am of a natural and acquired aloofness from many, if not"
11139,FAREWELL.[43],most popular tendencies of my time and place. It has greatly encouraged
11140,FAREWELL.[43],"me, for none can sympathize with thoughts like mine, who are permanently"
11141,FAREWELL.[43],insnared in the meshes of sect or party; none who prefer the formation
11142,FAREWELL.[43],"and advancement of mere opinions to the free pursuit of truth. I see,"
11143,FAREWELL.[43],"surely, that the topmost bubble or sparkle of the cup is no voucher for"
11144,FAREWELL.[43],"the nature of its contents throughout, and shall, in future, feel that"
11145,FAREWELL.[43],"in our age, nobler in that respect than most of the preceding ages, each"
11146,FAREWELL.[43],"sincere and fervent act or word is secure, not only of a final, but of a"
11147,FAREWELL.[43],speedy response.
11148,FAREWELL.[43],
11149,FAREWELL.[43],"I go to behold the wonders of art, and the temples of old religion. But"
11150,FAREWELL.[43],I shall see no forms of beauty and majesty beyond what my country is
11151,FAREWELL.[43],"capable of producing in myriad variety, if she has but the soul to will"
11152,FAREWELL.[43],"it; no temple to compare with what she might erect in the ages, if the"
11153,FAREWELL.[43],"catchword of the time, a sense of _divine order_, should become no more"
11154,FAREWELL.[43],"a mere word of form, but a deeply-rooted and pregnant idea in her life."
11155,FAREWELL.[43],"Beneath the light of a hope that this may be, I say to my friends once"
11156,FAREWELL.[43],more a kind farewell!
11157,FAREWELL.[43],
