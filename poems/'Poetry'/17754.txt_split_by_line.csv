41,THE BARONESS HOWE.,
42,THE BARONESS HOWE.,It would be a sufficient reason for sanctioning this work with your
43,THE BARONESS HOWE.,"Ladyship's name, that it is an offering of gratitude, presented because"
44,THE BARONESS HOWE.,there is nothing worthier to give.
45,THE BARONESS HOWE.,
46,THE BARONESS HOWE.,"But there is another cause. He who celebrates a patriot, cannot address"
47,THE BARONESS HOWE.,himself to any one more properly than to the daughter of a patriot; of
48,THE BARONESS HOWE.,"one who was for years the naval sun of England, and from whom the young"
49,THE BARONESS HOWE.,and enterprising caught the unextinguishable rays of patriotism and
50,THE BARONESS HOWE.,courage.
51,THE BARONESS HOWE.,
52,THE BARONESS HOWE.,"For actions and glory such as his, the female mind is not formed; but in"
53,THE BARONESS HOWE.,"the calm and active virtues of private life, which are almost equally"
54,THE BARONESS HOWE.,"honourable to the possessor, your Ladyship maintains the dignity of your"
55,THE BARONESS HOWE.,"race. I call to witness those whom you have soothed in affliction, and"
56,THE BARONESS HOWE.,those whom you have honoured with your friendship. They will vindicate
57,THE BARONESS HOWE.,"me from the charge of flattery, and support my assertion, that your"
58,THE BARONESS HOWE.,"patronage is as glorious to me, as any I could possibly have chosen."
59,THE BARONESS HOWE.,
60,THE BARONESS HOWE.,"With the hope, that the virtues of your excellent daughter, and your"
61,THE BARONESS HOWE.,"son, whom I am proud to call my friend, may answer your fullest"

73,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
74,PREFACE.,
75,PREFACE.,
76,PREFACE.,"As the author of these Poems is only seventeen, some apology may be"
77,PREFACE.,required for offering them to the public.
78,PREFACE.,
79,PREFACE.,Many precedents may be quoted in favour of early publication; and the
80,PREFACE.,"practice perhaps is not in itself blameable, except when the advice of"
81,PREFACE.,"good judges is unasked, or the work itself uncorrected and negligent. To"
82,PREFACE.,"neither of these charges is the author liable. These poems, as well as"
83,PREFACE.,"the design of publishing them, have been approved of by many sincere and"
84,PREFACE.,"judicious friends; and the work has been altered in many parts, in"
85,PREFACE.,conformity to the advice of the same persons. The author has made no
86,PREFACE.,"improper sacrifice to the Muse: he has deserted no duty, and neglected"
87,PREFACE.,"no necessary employment. Influenced by these motives, he appears before"
88,PREFACE.,"the bar of criticism, not indeed without diffidence, but unconscious of"
89,PREFACE.,"having deserved censure. If his verses are bad, he is content to sink"
90,PREFACE.,into oblivion; and if the public confirms the favourable judgment of his
91,PREFACE.,"friends, he does not deny that it will give him real satisfaction.--He"
92,PREFACE.,"is sensible, that if he delayed till time had matured his judgment, and"
93,PREFACE.,"reflection perfected his ideas, the ""_scribendi cacoÃ«thes_,"" perhaps an"
94,PREFACE.,"unfortunate inclination, would take a firm and unalterable possession"
95,PREFACE.,of his mind. He is therefore determined to try the public opinion; that
96,PREFACE.,he may be enabled either to pursue his poetical studies under their
97,PREFACE.,"encouragement, or to desist in time from an useless employment. This"
98,PREFACE.,"volume is not intended to challenge approbation, but to be the precursor"
99,PREFACE.,of something which may challenge it in future: it is not an attempt to
100,PREFACE.,"gain the prize, but a specimen of his powers, which may entitle him to"
101,PREFACE.,the honour of standing candidate for that prize. The reader will here
102,PREFACE.,"find the genuine effusions of a youthful fancy, free, yet not"
103,PREFACE.,"uncontrolled; a collection of pieces, exempt from negligence and"
104,PREFACE.,"inaccuracy, though not from the usual and inevitable faults of early"
105,PREFACE.,"compositions. To offer less than this would be arrogant, and to require"
106,PREFACE.,more than this would be unreasonable.
107,PREFACE.,
108,PREFACE.,"""Gustavus Vasa"" was originally planned (the reader will smile) at eleven"
109,PREFACE.,"years of age. When the author began to know what poetry was, his first"
110,PREFACE.,"design was to write an epic poem--no matter of what sort or character,"
111,PREFACE.,so it was an epic poem. The subject was soon chosen; and the progress of
112,PREFACE.,the work was various: sometimes hurried on with all the ardour of hope
113,PREFACE.,"and enterprize, sometimes relinquished for more lively pursuits, and"
114,PREFACE.,left to sleep for months in the leaves of a portfolio. In this manner
115,PREFACE.,"were six long cantos completed. At length the author, in his thirteenth"
116,PREFACE.,"year, perceived numerous faults and extravagances in his early"
117,PREFACE.,composition. He destroyed the manuscript: and some time after
118,PREFACE.,"recommenced his poem on a new and more rational plan. Accordingly, the"
119,PREFACE.,"first and part of the second book, were written in 1810, and the rest of"
120,PREFACE.,"the work which is published in this volume, principally in 1812. All"
121,PREFACE.,that is yet completed of this production (except the sequel of the
122,PREFACE.,"fourth book, and the whole fifth, which are yet uncorrected) is here"
123,PREFACE.,presented to the public; and on its success the continuation of
124,PREFACE.,"""Gustavus Vasa"" depends."
125,PREFACE.,
126,PREFACE.,"It was designed to embrace the whole actions of the hero, from his first"
127,PREFACE.,"signalizing himself under Steen Sture, to his death in 1560; but as all"
128,PREFACE.,this could not be regularly related without destroying the unity of the
129,PREFACE.,"poem, it was thought most convenient to begin with his introduction"
130,PREFACE.,"among the Dalecarlians at Mora, and conclude with his first election to"
131,PREFACE.,"the royalty, in 1523; the rest being introduced by means of narration,"
132,PREFACE.,"anticipation, and episode."
133,PREFACE.,
134,PREFACE.,"It will be doubtless objected, that the enterprize is beyond his powers,"
135,PREFACE.,and that he acted rashly in undertaking it. But this is no light scheme;
136,PREFACE.,"no work, begun for want of other amusement, and deserted when a more"
137,PREFACE.,specious or pleasing subject for poetry presented itself. He has
138,PREFACE.,considered it seriously; the subject appears full of poetical
139,PREFACE.,"capabilities, and superior to many others which offered themselves; and"
140,PREFACE.,"if the opinion of the world coincides with his own in this point, he"
141,PREFACE.,"has resolved to make it the favourite employment of his maturer years,"
142,PREFACE.,and to reduce it as far as possible to perfection. Part of his plan for
143,PREFACE.,"continuing the poem, will be found in the Notes."
144,PREFACE.,
145,PREFACE.,The smaller pieces are selected from a large number of original
146,PREFACE.,"compositions; they are not chosen as his favourites, but as what he"
147,PREFACE.,esteems most faultless. This appeared the safer method; since it is
148,PREFACE.,"impossible that ""the flimsy productions of a youth of seventeen,"" as"
149,PREFACE.,"Kirke White expresses it, should be free from considerable errors; and"
150,PREFACE.,"we are apt to think our most irregular flights, our most vigorous ones."
151,PREFACE.,"On these pieces, however, he places little stress; his principal"
152,PREFACE.,"reliance is on ""Gustavus Vasa."" The Latin Poems have been honoured by"
153,PREFACE.,the approbation of different Masters at Eton.
154,PREFACE.,
155,PREFACE.,The Author may be accused of arrogance in saying too much of himself.
156,PREFACE.,"But he felt strongly that early publication, and the design of writing a"
157,PREFACE.,"long epic poem, would naturally be censured by many well-meaning"
158,PREFACE.,persons; he thought it his duty to state his motives; and was less
159,PREFACE.,"solicitous to avoid the possible charge of self-conceit, than the"
160,PREFACE.,certain one of folly and presumption.
161,PREFACE.,
162,PREFACE.,"Any resemblance to former writers, which may occur in the course of the"
163,PREFACE.,"work, are generally unintentional. Thus the lines--"
164,PREFACE.,
165,PREFACE.,"""Touch'd the abyss, and, lest his eyes might view"
166,PREFACE.,"The abandon'd shore, into its depths withdrew,"""
167,PREFACE.,
168,PREFACE.,were written before the author had seen Persius's description of a
169,PREFACE.,totally abandoned man:
170,PREFACE.,
171,PREFACE.,"--nescit quid perdat, et, alto"
172,PREFACE.,"Demersus, summÃ¢ rursus non bullit in undÃ¢."
173,PREFACE.,
174,PREFACE.,
175,PREFACE.,
176,PREFACE.,
177,PREFACE.,_The Author has to express his sincere gratitude for a numerous and
178,PREFACE.,respectable list of Subscribers. It is far beyond his expectations; and
179,PREFACE.,"it encourages his hope, that the reception of the present volume will"
180,PREFACE.,authorize his continuing in the same pursuit._

979,BOOK I.,Around his steps a track of crimson drew.
980,BOOK I.,"Already, by Heaven's dark protection led,"
981,BOOK I.,To Dalecarlia Sweden's hero fled;
982,BOOK I.,"There, with a pious friend retired, unknown,"
983,BOOK I.,"He mourn'd his country's sorrows, and his own."

985,BOOK I.,"The sole surviving friends of Liberty,"

987,BOOK I.,And wait in silence the decisive hour.
988,BOOK I.,
989,BOOK I.,'Twas morn when Christiern bade a herald call
990,BOOK I.,His secret council to the regal hall--
991,BOOK I.,"Those whom his skill, selecting, had combined"
992,BOOK I.,To share the deep recesses of his mind:
993,BOOK I.,"In these the prince unshaken trust reposed,"
994,BOOK I.,To these his intricate designs disclosed;
995,BOOK I.,"Their counsel, teeming with maturest thought,"
996,BOOK I.,"His ripening plans to full perfection brought,"
997,BOOK I.,"Each enterprise with proper means supplied,"
998,BOOK I.,And stemm'd strong difficulty's threatening tide:
999,BOOK I.,"The summons heard, th' obedient train attend,"
1000,BOOK I.,"Collect, and hastening toward the palace bend."
1001,BOOK I.,
1002,BOOK I.,"First of their order, as in rank and fame"
1003,BOOK I.,"Superior, Upsal's haughty prelate came;"
1004,BOOK I.,"Erect in priestly pride, he stalk'd along,"
1005,BOOK I.,And tower'd supreme o'er all the princely throng.
1006,BOOK I.,"A soul congenial, and a mind replete"
1007,BOOK I.,"With ready artifice and bold deceit,"
1008,BOOK I.,"To suit a tyrant's ends, however base,"
1009,BOOK I.,In Christiern's friendship had secured his place.
1010,BOOK I.,"His were the senator's and courtier's parts,"
1011,BOOK I.,And all the statesman's magazine of arts;
1012,BOOK I.,"His, each expedient, each all-powerful wile,"
1013,BOOK I.,"To thwart a foe, or win a monarch's smile:"
1014,BOOK I.,The nicely-plann'd and well-pursued intrigue;
1015,BOOK I.,The smooth evasion of the hollow league;
1016,BOOK I.,"The specious argument, that subtly strays"
1017,BOOK I.,Thro' winding sophistry's protracted maze:
1018,BOOK I.,"The complicated, deep, immense design,"
1019,BOOK I.,"That works in darkness like a labouring mine,"
1020,BOOK I.,"Unknown to all, 'till, bursting into birth,"
1021,BOOK I.,Its wide explosion shakes th' astonish'd earth.
1022,BOOK I.,"His was the prompt invention, fruitful still"
1023,BOOK I.,In means subservient to the varying will:
1024,BOOK I.,"The flexible expertness, smooth and mean,"
1025,BOOK I.,"That glides thro' obstacles, and wins unseen:"
1026,BOOK I.,"The quick discernment, that with eagle eyes"
1027,BOOK I.,"Sees distant storms in ether darkly rise,"

1033,BOOK I.,High on the roll of ever-during fame;
1034,BOOK I.,"Snatch'd from Oppression's jaws some victim realm,"
1035,BOOK I.,Or fix'd in stable peace his country's wavering helm.
1036,BOOK I.,But baleful Guilt usurp'd with fatal care
1037,BOOK I.,A heart which Virtue had been proud to share;
1038,BOOK I.,"And turn'd to hateful dross the radiant ore,"
1039,BOOK I.,Whose lustre might have gilded Sweden's shore.
1040,BOOK I.,"As the red dog star, Autumn's fiery eye,"
1041,BOOK I.,"Shines eminent o'er all the spangled sky,"
1042,BOOK I.,While thro' th' afflicted earth his torrid breath
1043,BOOK I.,Darts glowing fevers and a cloud of death:
1044,BOOK I.,"So Trollio shone, in whose corrupted mind"
1045,BOOK I.,Transcendent genius and deep guilt combined;
1046,BOOK I.,"Placed all his arduous aims within his reach,"
1047,BOOK I.,Yet fix'd the stamp of infamy on each.
1048,BOOK I.,"But Providence, whose undiscover'd plan"
1049,BOOK I.,"Lies deeper than the wiliest schemes of man,"
1050,BOOK I.,"Can bare the sty designer's latent guilt,"
1051,BOOK I.,And crush to dust the structures he has built;
1052,BOOK I.,"Can disappoint the subtle tyrant's spite,"
1053,BOOK I.,And stem the billows of his stormy might;
1054,BOOK I.,"Confound a Trollio's skill, a Christiern's power,"
1055,BOOK I.,And blast presumption in its haughtiest hour.
1056,BOOK I.,"So Christiern found--and Trollio found it true,"
1057,BOOK I.,"(Unwelcome truth, to his experience new!)"
1058,BOOK I.,"That he, who trusts in guilty friendship, binds"
1059,BOOK I.,"His fortune to a cloud, that shifts with veering winds."
1060,BOOK I.,"Throned in Religion's seat, he scorn'd her laws,"
1061,BOOK I.,And with a cool indifference view'd her cause:
1062,BOOK I.,"Yet, might her earthly treasures feed the fire"
1063,BOOK I.,"Of wild ambition, or base gain's desire,"
1064,BOOK I.,"He could assume, at will, her fairest dress--"
1065,BOOK I.,Could plunge in Superstition's dark recess--
1066,BOOK I.,Or the red mask of Bigotry put on;
1067,BOOK I.,"The fiercest champion, where there needed none."
1068,BOOK I.,"But, should she cross some glittering enterprise,"
1069,BOOK I.,"Her pleas, her awful threats, he could despise;"
1070,BOOK I.,"Oaths, lightly sworn, and now forgotten things,"
1071,BOOK I.,"Vanish'd, like smoke before the tempest's wings."
1072,BOOK I.,"At interest's call, when danger's sudden voice"
1073,BOOK I.,"Extinguish'd hope, nor left a final choice,"
1074,BOOK I.,"His sacred honours he renounc'd, and fled"
1075,BOOK I.,To hide in silent solitude his head:
1076,BOOK I.,"At interest's call, he calmly thrust aside"
1077,BOOK I.,"Each bond of conscience that opposed his pride,"
1078,BOOK I.,"And, deeming every scruple out of place,"
1079,BOOK I.,Back posted to his dignified disgrace.
1080,BOOK I.,
1081,BOOK I.,"Next, with a lofty step advancing, came"
1082,BOOK I.,A martial chieftain--Otho was his name:
1083,BOOK I.,"In Denmark born, of an illustrious line,"
1084,BOOK I.,"Whose glories, now effaced, had ceased to shine;"
1085,BOOK I.,And he was but unanxious to redeem
1086,BOOK I.,"Those honours, in his eyes a worthless dream."
1087,BOOK I.,"Trained in licentious customs, he despised"
1088,BOOK I.,"All virtue's rules, and pleasure only prized;"
1089,BOOK I.,"And, faithful as the magnet, turn'd his head"
1090,BOOK I.,To follow fortune wheresoe'er it led:
1091,BOOK I.,"Tho' hostile justice rear'd her loftiest mound,"
1092,BOOK I.,To bar his passage o'er forbidden ground.
1093,BOOK I.,"Swift o'er all impediments he flew,"
1094,BOOK I.,And strain'd his eyes to keep the prize in view.
1095,BOOK I.,"Religion, virtue, sense, to him were nought;"
1096,BOOK I.,"He hated none, yet none employ'd his thought,"
1097,BOOK I.,"Save when he glitter'd in their borrowed beam,"
1098,BOOK I.,"To gain preferment, or to court esteem."
1099,BOOK I.,"The minister, not tool, of Christiern's will,"
1100,BOOK I.,"He serv'd his measures, yet despis'd him still:"
1101,BOOK I.,"Scann'd with impartial view th'encircling scene,"
1102,BOOK I.,"Glancing o'er all an eye exact and keen,"
1103,BOOK I.,"Advantage to descry; and seldom fail'd,"
1104,BOOK I.,"When Virtue's cause by Fortune's will prevail'd,"
1105,BOOK I.,"On virtue's side his valour to display,"
1106,BOOK I.,"And ne'er forsake it, but for better pay."
1107,BOOK I.,"And, e'en when Danger round his fenceless head"
1108,BOOK I.,"Her threatening weight of mountain surges spread,"
1109,BOOK I.,"He, like a whale amid the tempest's roar,"
1110,BOOK I.,"Smiled at the storm, nor deign'd to wish it o'er."
1111,BOOK I.,'Twas dull instinctive boldness--like a fire
1112,BOOK I.,"Pent up in earth, whose forces ne'er expire,"
1113,BOOK I.,"By grossest fuel nourished, but immured"
1114,BOOK I.,"In dingy night, shine heavy and obscured;"
1115,BOOK I.,"Sustain'd by this thro' all the scenes of strife,"
1116,BOOK I.,"Whose dark succession form'd his chequer'd life,"
1117,BOOK I.,"He ne'er the soul's sublimer courage felt,"
1118,BOOK I.,"That warms the heart, and teaches it to melt;"
1119,BOOK I.,"That nurses liberty's expanding seeds,"
1120,BOOK I.,And teems prolific with the noblest deeds.
1121,BOOK I.,"To guide the storm of battle o'er the plain,"
1122,BOOK I.,"Condense its force, expand it, or restrain;"
1123,BOOK I.,To turn the tide of conquest to defeat
1124,BOOK I.,"By stratagems too fatally complete,"
1125,BOOK I.,Or freeze it by delay; to aim at will
1126,BOOK I.,The well-timed stroke that mars all adverse skill;
1127,BOOK I.,"To range, in order firm, th'embattled line;"
1128,BOOK I.,"Or shape, as regular, the bold design;"
1129,BOOK I.,All these were his--yet not all these could claim
1130,BOOK I.,"Exemptions from the lot of penal shame,"
1131,BOOK I.,"Or snatch from glory's plant one servile wreath,"
1132,BOOK I.,"To deck the waste of crimes, that frown'd beneath."
1133,BOOK I.,"Harden'd in villany, with fate unfeign'd"
1134,BOOK I.,"He mock'd at warning, scorn'd reproach, nor deign'd"
1135,BOOK I.,"To answer either, and remorse's dart"
1136,BOOK I.,Recoil'd from his impenetrable heart:
1137,BOOK I.,Save in those hours when darkness or when pain
1138,BOOK I.,"Recals its force, and guilt recedes again;"
1139,BOOK I.,"When passion, vice, and fancy quit their sway,"
1140,BOOK I.,"When lawless pleasure trembling shrinks away,"
1141,BOOK I.,While black conviction's rushing whirlwinds quench
1142,BOOK I.,"Her smoky torch, and leave a sickening stench;"
1143,BOOK I.,"And thro' the soul's chill gloom, fierce conscience pours"
1144,BOOK I.,His fiery arrows in resistless showers.
1145,BOOK I.,"But, as accumulated guilt oppress'd"
1146,BOOK I.,"With stronger obstacles his hardening breast,"
1147,BOOK I.,"Faint and more faint the dread awakenings grew,"
1148,BOOK I.,And their subsiding terrors soon withdrew.
1149,BOOK I.,Like traces on the mountain's giant form
1150,BOOK I.,"Imprinted by the finger of the storm,"
1151,BOOK I.,They vanish'd; fierce atrocity return'd
1152,BOOK I.,"Triumphant, and the galling shackles spurn'd."
1153,BOOK I.,
1154,BOOK I.,"Him closely following, with a thoughtful pace"
1155,BOOK I.,"And slow, the young Ernestus took his place;"
1156,BOOK I.,"Like Bernheim, graced with an illustrious birth,"
1157,BOOK I.,But hapless Sweden was his native earth.
1158,BOOK I.,"His father sunk by death's untimely doom,"
1159,BOOK I.,"His youthful mother followed to the tomb,"
1160,BOOK I.,And to a honour'd friend's paternal care
1161,BOOK I.,"Bequeath'd her only hope, her infant heir."
1162,BOOK I.,With wary steps had Harfagar pass'd o'er
1163,BOOK I.,"The world's wide scene, and learn'd its various lore;"
1164,BOOK I.,"And, with religion's pole-star for his guide,"
1165,BOOK I.,Serenely voyaged life's tempestuous tide.
1166,BOOK I.,Yet in Ernestus' mind his skilful sense
1167,BOOK I.,Observ'd no dawn of future excellence;
1168,BOOK I.,He found no early graces to adorn
1169,BOOK I.,Of springing life the inauspicious morn;
1170,BOOK I.,"No prompt benevolence, no sacred flow"
1171,BOOK I.,Of purest feeling taught his heart to glow;
1172,BOOK I.,"But virtue's native influence was in him,"
1173,BOOK I.,"A wintry sun-beam, not extinct, but dim."
1174,BOOK I.,Yet Harfagar with kind attention tried
1175,BOOK I.,To rouse the warmth her hidden beams supplied;
1176,BOOK I.,"And, wheresoe'er his penetrating eye"
1177,BOOK I.,"One bud of distant promise could descry,"
1178,BOOK I.,"There all his toil was bent, to fix the root"
1179,BOOK I.,"Unmoved, and spread secure the growing shoot."
1180,BOOK I.,"He watch'd the rising blossoms as they grew,"
1181,BOOK I.,"Preserv'd with constant care their lively hue,"
1182,BOOK I.,Spread o'er each flow'ret a protecting veil
1183,BOOK I.,"To shelter it from trial's rougher gale,"
1184,BOOK I.,"And clear'd, with strenuous and unceasing toil,"
1185,BOOK I.,From each insidious weed th' improving soil.
1186,BOOK I.,His patient diligence had won at length
1187,BOOK I.,A partial triumph over nature's strength:
1188,BOOK I.,Tho' unsuppress'd th' internal weakness still
1189,BOOK I.,"With frequent bias pois'd the wavering will,"
1190,BOOK I.,"Still losing ground, it seem'd to die away,"
1191,BOOK I.,Like nightly storms before advancing day:
1192,BOOK I.,"When thrice seven rolling years matured his age,"
1193,BOOK I.,And call'd him forth to life's eventful stage.
1194,BOOK I.,
1195,BOOK I.,"'Twas now the time, when all the northern land"
1196,BOOK I.,Was sinking under Christiern's ruthless hand;
1197,BOOK I.,When patriotism from Sweden's hills sublime
1198,BOOK I.,"With tearful eyes o'erlook'd the subject clime,"
1199,BOOK I.,"And saw where Stenon and a matchless few,"
1200,BOOK I.,"To her bright race unalterably true,"
1201,BOOK I.,"Regardless of the thunders launch'd by Rome,"
1202,BOOK I.,"Self-titled arbitress of future doom,"
1203,BOOK I.,"O'er a waste realm her shatter'd flag unfurl'd,"
1204,BOOK I.,Conspicuous to the whole applauding world.
1205,BOOK I.,Ernestus' sire in Sweden's state before
1206,BOOK I.,High eminence and ample influence bore;
1207,BOOK I.,And public hope call'd forth the willing youth
1208,BOOK I.,To join the cause of liberty and truth;
1209,BOOK I.,Yet here his wary diffidence look'd round
1210,BOOK I.,"For due support--but no support was found,"
1211,BOOK I.,"For Harfagar, whose strong unconquer'd mind       }"
1212,BOOK I.,"The tyrant knew, unmatch'd among mankind,         }"
1213,BOOK I.,"Caught in his snares, was now in chains confined. }"
1214,BOOK I.,The sudden blow his resolution shook;
1215,BOOK I.,Deliberate fortitude his heart forsook;
1216,BOOK I.,"The pile of hope, that many a year had rear'd,"
1217,BOOK I.,"Seem'd sunk in air, and now no more appear'd."
1218,BOOK I.,"Stenon had welcomed him, benign and free,"
1219,BOOK I.,"With warm and undissembling amity,"
1220,BOOK I.,Enroll'd him in the list of friends select
1221,BOOK I.,He singled out his measures to direct--
1222,BOOK I.,And e'en his life was in Ernestus' power.
1223,BOOK I.,"This Christiern saw, and urg'd the fatal hour."
1224,BOOK I.,"With bribes and honours he the youth attack'd,"
1225,BOOK I.,"With promised secrecy his proffers back'd,"
1226,BOOK I.,"Tried smooth persuasion's most effectual strain,"
1227,BOOK I.,"And added threats, not likely to be vain."
1228,BOOK I.,"Strong was th' assault; he arm'd his hopeless breast,"
1229,BOOK I.,And summon'd all his forces to the test.
1230,BOOK I.,"His unassisted strength awhile withstood,"
1231,BOOK I.,"With desperate energy, th' invading flood,"
1232,BOOK I.,As the pale victim of all-conquering death
1233,BOOK I.,With one faint effort struggles yet for breath.
1234,BOOK I.,"His courage soon beneath th' encounter bent,"
1235,BOOK I.,"Languid before, and now by efforts spent;"
1236,BOOK I.,"He yielded--his brave chief to death betray'd,"
1237,BOOK I.,And Stenon's blood dyed treachery's reeking blade.
1238,BOOK I.,
1239,BOOK I.,"'Twas done; and peace the traitor's bosom left,"
1240,BOOK I.,"Of every comfort, every joy bereft."
1241,BOOK I.,"Rack'd by despair, in vain he sought repose:"
1242,BOOK I.,"Round all his steps a cloud of horror rose,"
1243,BOOK I.,"From keen reflection's maddening sting he fled,"
1244,BOOK I.,And rush'd on further crimes devoid of dread;
1245,BOOK I.,"Touch'd the abyss, and lest his eye might view"
1246,BOOK I.,"Th' abandon'd shore, into its depths withdrew."
1247,BOOK I.,
1248,BOOK I.,'Twas night; the cheerless moon's o'erclouded ray
1249,BOOK I.,Shone dim; the breeze's murmurs died away:
1250,BOOK I.,"On his wan brow unwonted slumbers creep,"
1251,BOOK I.,And drench his soul in visionary sleep.
1252,BOOK I.,When lo! deep thunders on his startled ear
1253,BOOK I.,"Successive roll, and shadowy forms appear;"
1254,BOOK I.,As thro' the misty vale at morning rise
1255,BOOK I.,A row of trees before the traveller's eyes.
1256,BOOK I.,"His father's, from the first of time, arose,"
1257,BOOK I.,"Their country's friends, and terror of her foes,"
1258,BOOK I.,"Who factions quell'd, or legal justice plann'd,"
1259,BOOK I.,Or bade fair science brighten o'er the land.
1260,BOOK I.,They came; they stopp'd--an angry eye they cast
1261,BOOK I.,"On the pale slumberer, and in silence pass'd."
1262,BOOK I.,Again the thunder roll'd; the lightning flew;
1263,BOOK I.,His country's form appear'd before his view:
1264,BOOK I.,"All stain'd with gore appear'd her azure vest,"
1265,BOOK I.,And her dim eyes unusual grief confess'd.
1266,BOOK I.,"The gloomy phantom on Ernestus frown'd,"
1267,BOOK I.,And with her sceptre touch'd the yawning ground:
1268,BOOK I.,"A boundless space, with mourning myriads spread,"
1269,BOOK I.,"Appear'd below, and thus the vision said:"
1270,BOOK I.,"""Behold th' abode of traitors! Sylla here,"
1271,BOOK I.,"And guiltier CÃ¦sar, mourn their mad career;"
1272,BOOK I.,Here Curio gnaws his chain--Ernestus! see
1273,BOOK I.,"A darker grave;--a grave reserv'd for thee!"""
1274,BOOK I.,The widening chasm around him seem'd to grow.
1275,BOOK I.,His kindred spirits call'd him from below;
1276,BOOK I.,"When lo! it closed--and from heaven's opening height,"
1277,BOOK I.,"A brilliant ray burst on his dazzled sight,"
1278,BOOK I.,"And broke the dream.--In deep amazement lost,"
1279,BOOK I.,Unnumber'd thoughts his feverish bosom cross'd;
1280,BOOK I.,"Hope, wonder, fear, and penitence combined,"
1281,BOOK I.,"For many a hour oppress'd his varying mind,"
1282,BOOK I.,'Till now in heaven's blue space the lamp of day
1283,BOOK I.,"Was hung serene: he hail'd the cheering ray,"
1284,BOOK I.,"And thus began: ""Eternal beam, give ear!"
1285,BOOK I.,"Earth, air, and thou, all-ruling Monarch, hear!"
1286,BOOK I.,"Call'd forth by thee from the deep maze of ill,"
1287,BOOK I.,"I haste, to work the mandates of thy will."
1288,BOOK I.,"This hour, this moment, unappall'd by shame,"
1289,BOOK I.,The servitude of guilt I will disclaim;
1290,BOOK I.,"And, if eternal mercy deign to spare"
1291,BOOK I.,"The forfeit life she rescued from despair,"
1292,BOOK I.,"'Tis mine to watch my country's hapless cause,"
1293,BOOK I.,And with fix'd soul defend her injured laws.
1294,BOOK I.,"Hear, Stenon, hear! from heaven's bright arch bend down"
1295,BOOK I.,"The sapphire glories of thy radiant crown,"
1296,BOOK I.,"Accept th' atonement with propitious brow,"
1297,BOOK I.,"And thro' the courts of heaven proclaim my vow!"""
1298,BOOK I.,
1299,BOOK I.,"Thus spoke Ernestus, and in silence sought"
1300,BOOK I.,"The council hall, involved in careful thought."
1301,BOOK I.,
1302,BOOK I.,These occupied a more distinguished seat;
1303,BOOK I.,A chosen train the monarch's list complete.
1304,BOOK I.,"There unsubmitting Brask's proud genius shone,"
1305,BOOK I.,"There Bernheim's might, in many a contest known;"
1306,BOOK I.,"There Theodore: a bold ungovern'd soul,"
1307,BOOK I.,"Rapacious, fell, and fearless of control:"
1308,BOOK I.,"A harlot's favour rais'd him from the dust,"
1309,BOOK I.,To rise the pander of tyrannic lust:
1310,BOOK I.,"Graced with successive gifts, at length he shone"
1311,BOOK I.,With wondering Trollio on the sacred throne.
1312,BOOK I.,"With pleasure's arts, and sophistry's refined,"
1313,BOOK I.,Alike he pleas'd the body and the mind;
1314,BOOK I.,"Skilful alike to cheat the wandering soul,"
1315,BOOK I.,Or mix luxurious pleasure's midnight bowl.
1316,BOOK I.,"All these, and more, at Christiern's sudden call,"
1317,BOOK I.,(A shining conclave) fill the towering hall.
1318,BOOK I.,
1319,BOOK I.,"Ere yet they enter'd, Trollio left the rest,"
1320,BOOK I.,"Th' advancing monarch met, and thus address'd:"
1321,BOOK I.,
1322,BOOK I.,"""Hear, Christiern, hear! th' unwelcome news attend,"
1323,BOOK I.,Forced from the lips of an unwilling friend.

1325,BOOK I.,I speak my message from our friends apart;
1326,BOOK I.,"I know their general worth, in duty tried,"
1327,BOOK I.,Yet in one man I tremble to confide:
1328,BOOK I.,"False to his country, to himself, and thee,"
1329,BOOK I.,"Sick of success, and tired of infamy,"
1330,BOOK I.,"Ernestus now prepares to burst your yoke,"
1331,BOOK I.,And win his freedom by some glorious stroke.
1332,BOOK I.,I know him well; his ever-varying soul
1333,BOOK I.,"Now searches earth, now looks beyond the pole;"
1334,BOOK I.,"Successive schemes usurp his changeful breast,"
1335,BOOK I.,"That seeks for toil, and languishes in rest:"
1336,BOOK I.,"Like a frail bark, the sport of every breeze,"
1337,BOOK I.,That floats unguided on the boundless seas.
1338,BOOK I.,E'en now I mark'd him--struggling passions play'd
1339,BOOK I.,"On his pale forehead, and alternate sway'd."
1340,BOOK I.,"Of this no more.--Our friends, dread prince, have sent"

1551,BOOK I.,"The tranquil captive press'd the rugged ground,"

1567,BOOK I.,"Down his warm cheeks the tears unbidden roll,"

1570,BOOK I.,Meanwhile the council closed; the peers withdrew:
1571,BOOK I.,To Trollio's dome the prince impatient flew;
1572,BOOK I.,"There saw at large the hostile plot disclosed,"
1573,BOOK I.,And his own plans with silent care disposed:

1631,BOOK II.,And tipp'd with yellow gems all ether shone.
1632,BOOK II.,"The breeze was silent on the glassy deep,"
1633,BOOK II.,And half the world was sinking into sleep:
1634,BOOK II.,Save where the shepherd led his fleecy train
1635,BOOK II.,To crop the verdure of the moon-light plain;
1636,BOOK II.,Save where the warder on the turret's height
1637,BOOK II.,"Trimm'd his weak lamp, and watch'd the bell of night,"
1638,BOOK II.,"And the lone captive, in the dungeon's gloom,"

1931,BOOK II.,"And, at his word, th' obedient felon sped."
1932,BOOK II.,
1933,BOOK II.,"The stars now gliding down th' ethereal blue,"
1934,BOOK II.,O'er earth and air a shadowy lustre threw;
1935,BOOK II.,"When, by relentless avarice led to fate,"
1936,BOOK II.,Olaus issued from the royal gate.
1937,BOOK II.,"The ruffian centinels their brother knew,"
1938,BOOK II.,And at his word the portals open flew.
1939,BOOK II.,"Then to the tower he moved with silent speed,"
1940,BOOK II.,"And smiled, exulting in the future deed."
1941,BOOK II.,
1942,BOOK II.,So to the town where weary riot sleeps
1943,BOOK II.,On purple clouds some dark contagion creeps:
1944,BOOK II.,"From eastern climes proceeding swift and fell,"
1945,BOOK II.,Where torrid suns the ripen'd poison swell;
1946,BOOK II.,Borne on infected gales along the skies
1947,BOOK II.,"Th' ethereal store of vast destruction flies,"
1948,BOOK II.,"O'er interposing deserts wins its way,"
1949,BOOK II.,"Blasts the green vale, and withers cheerful day;"
1950,BOOK II.,"Then settling on the walls, with steaming breath"
1951,BOOK II.,Pours thro' the thicken'd air disease and death.
1952,BOOK II.,
1953,BOOK II.,"And now in view the ancient castle frown'd,"
1954,BOOK II.,With many a dim-appearing turret crown'd:
1955,BOOK II.,"Here, round the gloomy doors, the warder-band"
1956,BOOK II.,(A watchful train) in silent order stand.
1957,BOOK II.,The jarring gates unfold: two torches play
1958,BOOK II.,"Thro' the broad gloom, and point the darksome way."
1959,BOOK II.,"First to Ernestus' cell his way he took,"
1960,BOOK II.,And from th' astonish'd youth his fetters shook.
1961,BOOK II.,"Next to the sage, now wrapp'd in slumber, sped,      }"
1962,BOOK II.,"Loos'd his firm chain, and rais'd his sleeping head; }"
1963,BOOK II.,And thro' the echoing valves the noble captives led. }
1964,BOOK II.,With kindling eye the hoary sire survey'd
1965,BOOK II.,"The stars careering thro' the nightly shade,"
1966,BOOK II.,"Fix'd on the long-lost heavens his raptured sight,"
1967,BOOK II.,And drank with joy the flowing gale of night.
1968,BOOK II.,
1969,BOOK II.,"Then thus Olaus: ""To my anxious king,"
1970,BOOK II.,"Illustrious Swedes, your nightly steps I bring."
1971,BOOK II.,"He knows your worth, and deems his power were vain,"
1972,BOOK II.,Should souls like your's a captive doom sustain.
1973,BOOK II.,"Secret his purpose, to the farther coast"
1974,BOOK II.,Of Bothnia's gulph he leads his gather'd host.
1975,BOOK II.,"When first gray twilight spread her glimmering shade,"
1976,BOOK II.,On the broad main his streamers were display'd:
1977,BOOK II.,And soon th' auspicious breeze shall waft you o'er
1978,BOOK II.,"To meet your monarch on the destined shore."""
1979,BOOK II.,
1980,BOOK II.,"He spoke, but neither answer'd--wonder hung"
1981,BOOK II.,"On either mind, and silenced either tongue;"
1982,BOOK II.,"Fix'd for a space, each other's form they view'd;"
1983,BOOK II.,"Then, wrapp'd in thought, their unknown guide pursued."
1984,BOOK II.,"O'er the dark streets with half-extinguish'd beam,"
1985,BOOK II.,The scatter'd lamps diffused a quivering gleam;
1986,BOOK II.,At distant intervals the ruddy light
1987,BOOK II.,Half mingles with the dusky robe of night:
1988,BOOK II.,"While, as they past, with loud repeated stroke"
1989,BOOK II.,A midnight bell the solemn stillness broke.
1990,BOOK II.,
1991,BOOK II.,"At length they reach the borders of the deep,"
1992,BOOK II.,Where a selected band in silence keep
1993,BOOK II.,"Perpetual watch. Before Olaus' stride,"
1994,BOOK II.,"Ere yet he spoke, th' obedient crowd divide."
1995,BOOK II.,"A lonely boat amidst the harbour stood,"
1996,BOOK II.,And cast its shadow o'er the neighbouring flood.
1997,BOOK II.,"This from the strand he loos'd, and bade the sail"
1998,BOOK II.,Spread its white bosom to th' indulgent gale:
1999,BOOK II.,"They take their seats, and from the lessening shore"
2000,BOOK II.,It flies; the parted billows foam before:
2001,BOOK II.,"On each wan cheek the freshening breezes play,"
2002,BOOK II.,And speed their passage o'er the watery way.
2003,BOOK II.,The silver splendors of the lunar beam          }
2004,BOOK II.,"Dance on the waves, and in the quiet stream     }"
2005,BOOK II.,The twinkling stars with faint reflection gleam }
2006,BOOK II.,"Now on the guide Ernestus turn'd his eyes,"
2007,BOOK II.,"The gloomy look, and the gigantic size;"
2008,BOOK II.,"Now on his friend, involv'd in new amaze,"
2009,BOOK II.,Fix'd the keen ardour of his silent gaze:
2010,BOOK II.,"Each thought reflected on his brow was seen,"
2011,BOOK II.,And all his soul seem'd centred in his mien.
2012,BOOK II.,
2013,BOOK II.,"Meanwhile the felon, exercised in ill,"
2014,BOOK II.,Watch'd the due time to work his master's will;
2015,BOOK II.,"At length his sable robe aside he threw,"
2016,BOOK II.,And from its dark concealing mantle drew
2017,BOOK II.,A dagger's well-tried point. The moonshine play'd
2018,BOOK II.,On the smooth surface of the polish'd blade.
2019,BOOK II.,Ernestus saw: his heart-blood quicker flow'd;
2020,BOOK II.,On his bold cheek the mounting courage glow'd:
2021,BOOK II.,"Inspired by Heaven, a sudden vigour strung"
2022,BOOK II.,"His youthful limbs; high from the deck he sprung,"
2023,BOOK II.,"And grasp'd the steel, then, wheeling swiftly round,"
2024,BOOK II.,On the astonish'd ruffian dealt a wound:
2025,BOOK II.,"Th' unerring blade, with nervous force impell'd,"
2026,BOOK II.,"Deep thro' his neck its bloody passage held,"
2027,BOOK II.,Prone falls the staggering wretch: the wary foe
2028,BOOK II.,With added strength inflicts a second blow;
2029,BOOK II.,"Then heaves his prostrate bulk with forceful strain,"
2030,BOOK II.,And hurls him headlong in the flashing main.
2031,BOOK II.,"High o'er his head the booming surges sweep,"
2032,BOOK II.,And his soul bursts amidst the roaring deep.
2033,BOOK II.,
2034,BOOK II.,"Now on the deck distain'd with recent blood,"
2035,BOOK II.,"Involv'd in thought the silent victor stood,"
2036,BOOK II.,And turn'd to Harfagar--when on his view
2037,BOOK II.,"Successive wonders burst, and all around him grew."
2038,BOOK II.,"Faint and more feint the billowy roar became,"
2039,BOOK II.,"And sunk, and died at last.--With lessening flame"
2040,BOOK II.,"The starry host along th' ethereal way,"
2041,BOOK II.,"Unknown the cause, successive die away."
2042,BOOK II.,"For yet the morn was far, nor had the sky"
2043,BOOK II.,With reddening blush proclaimed the solar glory nigh.
2044,BOOK II.,"Amidst the swiftly-changing scene, amazed,"
2045,BOOK II.,"They stood, and on the brightening ether gazed:"
2046,BOOK II.,"They gazed, but trembled not: some power unseen"
2047,BOOK II.,Confirmed their hearts to meet the awful scene.
2048,BOOK II.,"O'er the wide skies, and o'er the ocean's bed,"
2049,BOOK II.,"A growing stream of wavy splendor spread,"
2050,BOOK II.,As if another sun with bright control
2051,BOOK II.,"Had changed heaven's motions, and revers'd the pole."
2052,BOOK II.,Nature was in alarm: with sudden dread        }
2053,BOOK II.,To his dark nook the screaming sew-mew fled:  }
2054,BOOK II.,The murmurs of the midnight breeze were dead. }
2055,BOOK II.,"Wider and wider spread th' unusual glare,"
2056,BOOK II.,And the last cloud at length dispers'd in air.
2057,BOOK II.,"When, as a flame bursts broad thro' azure smoke,"
2058,BOOK II.,From the bright cloud a dazzling vision broke.
2059,BOOK II.,"Like some tall dome, that shoots its towers on high,"
2060,BOOK II.,His airy stature mingled with the sky:
2061,BOOK II.,"Terror and might stood blended in his mien,"
2062,BOOK II.,And his blue eye-balls shone with flames serene.
2063,BOOK II.,"A wreath of light his fulgent brows array'd,"
2064,BOOK II.,"That, shifting, with a thousand colours play'd."
2065,BOOK II.,"His star-bespangled robe, of sparkling blue,"
2066,BOOK II.,O'er sea and air reflected glories threw:
2067,BOOK II.,"The moon, the skies, the golden stream of rays,"
2068,BOOK II.,Seem'd lost and dimm'd in that all-conquering blaze.
2069,BOOK II.,"His yellow locks sail'd on the clouds afar,"
2070,BOOK II.,And o'er his temples flamed the northern star.
2071,BOOK II.,"His better hand sustain'd a spacious shield,"
2072,BOOK II.,Round as nocturnal Cynthia's argent field;
2073,BOOK II.,On whose enormous surface stood emblazed
2074,BOOK II.,"A mighty realm, with towers and turrets rais'd."
2075,BOOK II.,"Here, a broad lake in mimic waves extends;"
2076,BOOK II.,"There, a tall mountain's sloping summit bends."
2077,BOOK II.,"O'er many a river many a navy rode,"
2078,BOOK II.,"With commerce rich, and thro' the yielding flood"
2079,BOOK II.,"With outspread sails proceeded--all around,"
2080,BOOK II.,"Huge untamed rocks, and giant castles frown'd."
2081,BOOK II.,"The vault above serenely calm appear'd,"
2082,BOOK II.,And cloudless light the short-lived summer cheer'd.
2083,BOOK II.,"Here, fell marauders wasting far and near"
2084,BOOK II.,Spread their wild ravage o'er the yellow year:
2085,BOOK II.,"There, towers and walls and lofty works extend;"
2086,BOOK II.,Victorious legions the scaled walls ascend.
2087,BOOK II.,"Last stretch'd along a valley's shadowy length,"
2088,BOOK II.,Appear'd two realms' consolidated strength.
2089,BOOK II.,"Wide fly the glowing balls, swift falchions glare,"
2090,BOOK II.,And whizzing arrows hide the clouded air.
2091,BOOK II.,"The sculptured kings pursue their trembling foes,"
2092,BOOK II.,"And, where they move, the imaged tumult grows."
2093,BOOK II.,Another scene--the toil of war is past;
2094,BOOK II.,"This seems to triumph, that to groan his last:"
2095,BOOK II.,"Blood covers all, refulgent trophies rise,"
2096,BOOK II.,And shouts of conquest seem to rend the skies.
2097,BOOK II.,
2098,BOOK II.,"In silent reverence stood each wondering Swede,"
2099,BOOK II.,Unmoved by terror: thrice the youth decreed
2100,BOOK II.,"To speak, and thrice upon his fetter'd tongue,"
2101,BOOK II.,"Restrain'd by awe, th' imperfect accents hung,"
2102,BOOK II.,When the dread form the boundless stillness broke;
2103,BOOK II.,Ocean and air stood listening as he spoke.
2104,BOOK II.,
2105,BOOK II.,"""The power who reins the whirlwind's stormy force,"
2106,BOOK II.,"And guides the wheeling planets in their course,"
2107,BOOK II.,"Provoked by crimes, o'er Sweden's guilty land"
2108,BOOK II.,Stretch'd wide the terrors of his flaming hand:
2109,BOOK II.,"Her venal priests, her kings in luxury lost,"
2110,BOOK II.,"Her factious nobles, and seditious host,"
2111,BOOK II.,Call'd down th' unwilling bolt; and many a year
2112,BOOK II.,"Beheld it blaze, and shrunk beneath its flames severe."
2113,BOOK II.,His angry thunder on a blasted shore           }
2114,BOOK II.,Has wreak'd its vengeance; the collected store }
2115,BOOK II.,"Of wrath is spent, and the last peal is o'er.  }"
2116,BOOK II.,"Now o'er the land, rich with a new-born spring,"
2117,BOOK II.,Returning Mercy waves her golden wing:
2118,BOOK II.,"Obedient fate draws back its sable line,              }"
2119,BOOK II.,And bright events in long succession shine:           }
2120,BOOK II.,"Consenting years roll on, and crown the great design. }"
2121,BOOK II.,"Unnumber'd arts, more glorious from decay,"
2122,BOOK II.,"Rise one by one, and gild the land with day."
2123,BOOK II.,"No more shall Sweden mourn her fetter'd doom,"
2124,BOOK II.,"The sport of despots, and the slave of Rome:"
2125,BOOK II.,"Slanderers of Heaven, betrayers of mankind"
2126,BOOK II.,"By passion bloated, and to reason blind,"
2127,BOOK II.,Her prelates shall oppress the land no more;
2128,BOOK II.,"But Liberty, with charms unknown before,"
2129,BOOK II.,"Break forth effulgent; and protecting Peace,"
2130,BOOK II.,"For a long age, bid battle's trumpet cease."

2132,BOOK II.,"I come, to bid primeval blessings reign,       }"
2133,BOOK II.,And exiled Science lift her sacred lamp again. }
2134,BOOK II.,
2135,BOOK II.,"""Thou, Harfagar, allied to earth no more,"
2136,BOOK II.,"Pursue my flight, and seek our friendly shore."
2137,BOOK II.,Thy term of care is past: thy clouded day
2138,BOOK II.,Dissolves at length in heaven's eternal ray.
2139,BOOK II.,"Th' almighty Parent calls thee, from on high,"
2140,BOOK II.,To fill the seats of immortality.
2141,BOOK II.,"His eyes the labours of mankind regard,"
2142,BOOK II.,And suffering virtue claims her late reward.
2143,BOOK II.,"There may'st thou sit, and far removed from thence"
2144,BOOK II.,Behold the clouds of passion and of sense:
2145,BOOK II.,"Smile at the tumults of the world below,"
2146,BOOK II.,And triumph in the weakness of thy foe.
2147,BOOK II.,
2148,BOOK II.,"""And thou, Ernestus--thou, to whom 'tis given"
2149,BOOK II.,"To bear the tidings of benignant Heaven,"
2150,BOOK II.,"Aided by me, pursue the watery road,"
2151,BOOK II.,And seek Gustavus in his dark abode.
2152,BOOK II.,Where swift Dal-Elbe his wandering current leads
2153,BOOK II.,"Thro' barren mountains and uncultured meads,"
2154,BOOK II.,"Resign'd to cold despair, the hero lies,"
2155,BOOK II.,Nor knows the favour of th' indulgent skies.
2156,BOOK II.,For twenty months unwearied has he traced
2157,BOOK II.,"The town, the province, and the watery waste:"
2158,BOOK II.,No aiding friend his patriot labours found;
2159,BOOK II.,"Fear master'd all, and all were slaves around."
2160,BOOK II.,"Each hope of liberty and Sweden lost,"
2161,BOOK II.,"He now resolves to seek a foreign coast,"
2162,BOOK II.,"In Albion or in Gaul secure to rest,"
2163,BOOK II.,And cling to Freedom's warm maternal breast.

2171,BOOK II.,And Sudermania echo back the sound:
2172,BOOK II.,"The frank Westmanian's generous heart shall glow,"
2173,BOOK II.,And join the sterner Goth to crush the foe.
2174,BOOK II.,"Bid him his standard in mid Sweden rear,"
2175,BOOK II.,And check th' oppressor in his fell career:
2176,BOOK II.,"Say, that, impatient of unjust command,"
2177,BOOK II.,Indignant Denmark spurns him from her land!
2178,BOOK II.,He builds a lofty tower; the basis stands
2179,BOOK II.,Fix'd in the stormy ocean's moving sands:
2180,BOOK II.,"The turrets in unstable grandeur rise,"
2181,BOOK II.,"The baseless fabric shoots into the skies,"
2182,BOOK II.,Soon shall the glories of the ponderous hall
2183,BOOK II.,"Come thundering down, to crush him in their fall!"

2197,BOOK II.,"Soar'd thro' the clouds, and mingled with the wind."
2198,BOOK II.,Th' angelic power his sacred arm applied
2199,BOOK II.,"To push the vessel o'er the yielding tide,"
2200,BOOK II.,And swifter than the eagle's noon-day flight
2201,BOOK II.,"It flew: while, melting from the dazzled sight,"
2202,BOOK II.,"O'er the wide heavens a radiant line he drew,"
2203,BOOK II.,The track still glittering where the glory flew.
2204,BOOK II.,
2205,BOOK II.,And now 'twas silence all: the pale stars shone;
2206,BOOK II.,"The moon, declining, fill'd her ruddy throne."

2214,BOOK II.,No single breath the general stillness stirr'd;
2215,BOOK II.,"Their trampling feet alone the warder heard,"

2426,BOOK III.,"Convinced at length, he spoke: the woods around"
2427,BOOK III.,With solemn awe return'd the mournful sound;

2443,BOOK III.,"Each following age will bring increase of woe,"

2460,BOOK III.,"The yelling sons of Odin rush'd to fight,"
2461,BOOK III.,"And rent the eagles of invading Rome,"
2462,BOOK III.,Whose power had changed a hundred nations' doom.
2463,BOOK III.,"In vain the Empress of the Northern Zone,"
2464,BOOK III.,With arts on arts high piled her ill-gained throne:
2465,BOOK III.,"Stern Engelbert trod Usurpation down,"
2466,BOOK III.,And from the thirteenth Eric tore the crown.
2467,BOOK III.,"Yet may my country fall--earth's works decay,"

2529,BOOK III.,"And hope shone kindling in thy dying eye,"
2530,BOOK III.,That some new sun would rise to light her starless sky.--
2531,BOOK III.,"'Twas then, when Christiern thought the axe too slow,"
2532,BOOK III.,"And watch'd with eager transport every blow,"
2533,BOOK III.,And drank each murmur that to death consign'd
2534,BOOK III.,"The noblest, wisest, bravest of mankind,--"
2535,BOOK III.,When ev'n the gazing crowd was doom'd to feel
2536,BOOK III.,"The fury of his yet unsated steel,--"

2542,BOOK III.,"He paused, and starting from the verdant ground"
2543,BOOK III.,"With hurried footsteps paced the forests round,"
2544,BOOK III.,"Stung with fierce grief, 'till the full tide of woes"

2546,BOOK III.,
2547,BOOK III.,"While yet he roams beneath the shady groves,"
2548,BOOK III.,And tears gush forth at every step he roves;
2549,BOOK III.,"Sleep's humid vapours lessening on his eyes,"
2550,BOOK III.,"Ernestus rose, and mark'd the changing skies."
2551,BOOK III.,"And now a furze-clad eminence he found,"

2553,BOOK III.,"From this, with eye insatiate, he admires"
2554,BOOK III.,"Woods, hamlets, fields, and awe-commanding spires."
2555,BOOK III.,"And seeks where first to steer his fateful flight,"
2556,BOOK III.,Safe under covert of the quiet night.
2557,BOOK III.,"Wide to the left the blue-tinged river roll'd,"
2558,BOOK III.,"And faintly tipped with eve's departing gold,"
2559,BOOK III.,"The village rose: half-shaded, on the right"
2560,BOOK III.,A sloping hill appeared to bound the sight:
2561,BOOK III.,"From its hoar summit to the midmost vale,"
2562,BOOK III.,Unnumbered boughs waved floating in the gale.
2563,BOOK III.,"Imbrown'd with ceaseless toil, a smiling train"
2564,BOOK III.,"Whirl the keen axe, and clear the farther plain,"
2565,BOOK III.,"The intruding trees and scatter'd stems o'erthrow,"
2566,BOOK III.,And form a grassy theatre below.

2568,BOOK III.,O'er rock and valley shed their lengthening streams;
2569,BOOK III.,"Three youths at each their joyous station keep,"
2570,BOOK III.,"In festive contest bent to banish sleep,"
2571,BOOK III.,And strive which first shall see the morn arise
2572,BOOK III.,With pale-red streamer waving thro' the skies.
2573,BOOK III.,Sequester'd from the rest a shaded dome
2574,BOOK III.,"Arose, the son of Eric's rural home:"
2575,BOOK III.,"On its low roof the light appear'd to rest,"
2576,BOOK III.,The last green light that trembled in the west.
2577,BOOK III.,"Thither, by Heaven impell'd, he took his way,"
2578,BOOK III.,And sought the spot where Sweden's hero lay.
2579,BOOK III.,
2580,BOOK III.,"Meanwhile beneath an oak, ere day was met,"
2581,BOOK III.,"The village-chiefs, a rustic council, met;"
2582,BOOK III.,Whom ancient custom bade with annual care
2583,BOOK III.,The ensuing day's festivities prepare.
2584,BOOK III.,Thro' their dark locks cold sigh'd the evening wind;
2585,BOOK III.,Their dogs upon the dewy plain reclined
2586,BOOK III.,Beside them lay. In their afflicted thought
2587,BOOK III.,"Each proof of Christiern's fell oppression wrought,"
2588,BOOK III.,"Each deed, each menace: gloomy bodings swell"

2606,BOOK III.,"Soon shall behold the waving sheets of fire,"
2607,BOOK III.,"Sent from their peaceful domes, to heaven aspire."
2608,BOOK III.,"Each year, each month, new towns with ruin smoke,"
2609,BOOK III.,And province after province feels the yoke.

3070,BOOK IV.,And Suecia's guardian angel thus address'd:
3071,BOOK IV.,
3072,BOOK IV.,"""Haste, faithful Spirit! to the nether skies,"
3073,BOOK IV.,Where Dalecarlia's misty mountains rise:
3074,BOOK IV.,"A Danish fort on the rude frontier stands,"
3075,BOOK IV.,"Pregnant with war, and all the land commands:"
3076,BOOK IV.,"With specious safety lull the band to rest,"
3077,BOOK IV.,"Unstring each nerve, and weaken every breast."
3078,BOOK IV.,"The peasant-tribes with new-born strength inspire,"
3079,BOOK IV.,"Bid ev'n the fearful glow with martial fire,"
3080,BOOK IV.,"With sudden hope their cold despondence quell,"
3081,BOOK IV.,And patriot grief with patriot ire dispel.
3082,BOOK IV.,"Thence bend thy way to Denmark's stormy coast,"
3083,BOOK IV.,Where princely Frederic heads his secret host.
3084,BOOK IV.,"Let fears and jealousies each town alarm,"
3085,BOOK IV.,And Denmark's boldest tribes for Frederic arm.
3086,BOOK IV.,"That done, on Eric's hero-son attend,"
3087,BOOK IV.,"Each motion guide, and each design befriend;"
3088,BOOK IV.,And to his sight in broader view unfold
3089,BOOK IV.,The bright events to young Ernestus told.
3090,BOOK IV.,"Such be thy task: the rest in silence wait,"
3091,BOOK IV.,"'Till changeful time shall work the will of fate."""
3092,BOOK IV.,
3093,BOOK IV.,"Before the throne th' obedient Seraph bows,"
3094,BOOK IV.,And veils the star that glitters on his brows;
3095,BOOK IV.,Then thro' the blue abyss impetuous flies
3096,BOOK IV.,"Where starr'd with suns heaven's ample pathway lies,"
3097,BOOK IV.,"Its radiant limit: thro' that path he springs,"
3098,BOOK IV.,And shoots smooth-gliding on refulgent wings.
3099,BOOK IV.,
3100,BOOK IV.,Far in the void of heaven a secret way
3101,BOOK IV.,"Leads from the mansions of empyreal day,"
3102,BOOK IV.,"That wanders devious from the road of light,"
3103,BOOK IV.,And deepens gradual into central night:
3104,BOOK IV.,By this dim path he sought the dark profound
3105,BOOK IV.,"Of utmost hell, Creation's flaming bound,"
3106,BOOK IV.,"Saw the far-distant gleam, and heard the roar"
3107,BOOK IV.,Of dashing surges on the burning shore.
3108,BOOK IV.,"With hasty steps he trod the deep descent,"
3109,BOOK IV.,"Thro' the gross air, that brighten'd as he went,"
3110,BOOK IV.,"And call'd a spirit from the gulphs below,"
3111,BOOK IV.,"Heaven's scourge, and minister of human woe."
3112,BOOK IV.,"The summon'd fiend forsook the fiery wave,"
3113,BOOK IV.,And Sweden's Genius thus his mandate gave:
3114,BOOK IV.,
3115,BOOK IV.,"""To Dalecarlia's tented fields repair,"
3116,BOOK IV.,And seek the Danish host assembled there.
3117,BOOK IV.,With seeming safety and false hopes destroy
3118,BOOK IV.,"Their watchful care, and melt them down to joy;"
3119,BOOK IV.,"And, while they sleep in the delusive charm,"
3120,BOOK IV.,"Unstring each nerve, and weaken every arm;"
3121,BOOK IV.,"So shall their fears, not Vasa, strike the blow,"
3122,BOOK IV.,"And ready Conquest meet the coming foe."""
3123,BOOK IV.,
3124,BOOK IV.,"He spoke. Incumbent on the boundless night,"
3125,BOOK IV.,To upper air they wing their echoing flight:
3126,BOOK IV.,"Thence swift to earth their airy voyage bend,"
3127,BOOK IV.,Where the cold North's unmeasured tracts extend:
3128,BOOK IV.,"O'er pine-clad Norway's wilderness of snow,"
3129,BOOK IV.,"O'er the huge Dofrine's cloudy tops they go,"
3130,BOOK IV.,Thro' many a fertile province urge their flight;
3131,BOOK IV.,And on Dal-Elbe's uncultured plains alight.
3132,BOOK IV.,
3133,BOOK IV.,Thro' the majestic forest's leafy pride
3134,BOOK IV.,"The murmurs of the recent tempest sigh'd,"
3135,BOOK IV.,"The shades of eve were closed, and pattering showers"
3136,BOOK IV.,Shed added gloom o'er midnight's starless hours.
3137,BOOK IV.,"Sleep in his downy car o'er Mora rode,"
3138,BOOK IV.,And soft-winged Silence ruled the calm abode.
3139,BOOK IV.,"Lull'd by the distant gale's unequal sound,"
3140,BOOK IV.,"The peasants press their beds, with rushes crown'd,"
3141,BOOK IV.,"From daily toil and fear a respite steal,"
3142,BOOK IV.,And dream of joys the waking may not feel.
3143,BOOK IV.,
3144,BOOK IV.,"High blazing on the Danish castle's brow,"
3145,BOOK IV.,The beacon redden'd all the fields below.
3146,BOOK IV.,"From its tall battlements, o'er moat and dell,"
3147,BOOK IV.,"Chequering the light, uncertain shadows fell."
3148,BOOK IV.,"On high, the warder tunes his martial song;"
3149,BOOK IV.,"The rocks, the dales, the cheerful notes prolong."
3150,BOOK IV.,
3151,BOOK IV.,"On a broad plain the rising structure stands,"
3152,BOOK IV.,"The work of Dalecarlia's mountain bands,"
3153,BOOK IV.,"In ancient years, ere Margaret ruled the clime,"
3154,BOOK IV.,"Majestic still it stands, and unimpair'd by time."
3155,BOOK IV.,The Western height primeval rocks inclose;
3156,BOOK IV.,Low-murmuring to the south a river flows:
3157,BOOK IV.,"The rest with towers and tower-like works was crown'd,"
3158,BOOK IV.,And cast a various shadow o'er the ground.
3159,BOOK IV.,"Unnumber'd outworks, lessening by degrees,"
3160,BOOK IV.,Sloped to the plain: wide quivering to the breeze
3161,BOOK IV.,"The Danish standard, on the heights unrolled,"
3162,BOOK IV.,Inflames the air with many a waving fold.
3163,BOOK IV.,"Stupendous gates the massy fabric crown'd,"
3164,BOOK IV.,That rough with iron studs impervious frown'd.
3165,BOOK IV.,Oft had the rocky cattle's rugged form
3166,BOOK IV.,From its steep sides roll'd off the martial storm:
3167,BOOK IV.,"And whirlwinds, wasting all the neighbouring plain,"
3168,BOOK IV.,Spent their loud anger on its walls in vain.
3169,BOOK IV.,"Lofty it stood, impregnated with war,"
3170,BOOK IV.,And seem'd a craggy mountain from afar.
3171,BOOK IV.,
3172,BOOK IV.,"Fast by a fire, whose half-extinguished rays"
3173,BOOK IV.,"Shot here and there a fluctuating blaze,"
3174,BOOK IV.,The warriors' languid eyes in slumber closed;
3175,BOOK IV.,"Their arms, beside them, gleam'd as they reposed."
3176,BOOK IV.,"The guards alone, still cautious of surprise,  }"
3177,BOOK IV.,"Watch'd at each gate, and gazing on the skies, }"
3178,BOOK IV.,Repell'd unwilling slumber from their eyes.    }
3179,BOOK IV.,
3180,BOOK IV.,"Five hundred Danish youths this post maintain'd,"
3181,BOOK IV.,"To fight alike, and hardy ravage train'd;"
3182,BOOK IV.,"Prepared the fiercest mountain-host to dare,"
3183,BOOK IV.,And dash from many a battlement the war;
3184,BOOK IV.,"Prepared to hurl the whizzing lance, to pour"
3185,BOOK IV.,"The missive flame, or dart the arrowy shower:"
3186,BOOK IV.,"Young Eric the selected squadron led,"
3187,BOOK IV.,"Count Bernheim's son, in camps and contests bred;"
3188,BOOK IV.,"A fiery spirit, never at a stay,"
3189,BOOK IV.,With martial projects teeming night and day;

3191,BOOK IV.,"Untouch'd, he held, thro' crimes, his fearless course;"
3192,BOOK IV.,"Proud, like his king, to conquer and oppress,"
3193,BOOK IV.,"In action rash, and haughty with success."

3195,BOOK IV.,"While thus deep slumber half the troop oppress'd,"
3196,BOOK IV.,"And ev'n the waking found a pause of rest,"
3197,BOOK IV.,"The joyful demon, with malignant look,"
3198,BOOK IV.,O'er all the host his sable mantle shook.
3199,BOOK IV.,Instant before the slumbering soldier's eyes
3200,BOOK IV.,Dreams of past joy and sweet illusions rise:
3201,BOOK IV.,And he whose ardent spirit late engaged
3202,BOOK IV.,"In airy wars, and bloodless battles waged,"
3203,BOOK IV.,"A mountain-chief in every vision slew,"
3204,BOOK IV.,"And on the yielding rear still foremost flew,"
3205,BOOK IV.,"Now, sudden, sees each fading phantom changed,"
3206,BOOK IV.,"Feels every care and thought from war estranged,"
3207,BOOK IV.,"Seeks the lost quiet of his native shore,"
3208,BOOK IV.,"And mourns the lengthen'd toils, he gloried in before:"
3209,BOOK IV.,"Burns with impetuous pleasure's feverish fire,"

3485,A POEM.,
3486,A POEM.,
3487,A POEM.,"'Twas night: the stars denied one cheering ray,"
3488,A POEM.,And wrapp'd in clouds the lunar splendours lay.
3489,A POEM.,"No lightest zephyr brush'd the silent floods,"
3490,A POEM.,Or swept the bosom of the lofty woods:
3491,A POEM.,Each human heart the general calm confess'd;
3492,A POEM.,The childless sire had hush'd his cares to rest:
3493,A POEM.,"And he, the victim of his country's laws,"
3494,A POEM.,"The base deserter of her awful cause,"
3495,A POEM.,"Whose eyes no more in earthly sleep shall close, }"
3496,A POEM.,"Yet sunk oppress'd, and drank in calm repose     }"
3497,A POEM.,"A short, a deep oblivion of his woes.            }"
3498,A POEM.,
3499,A POEM.,"Diffusing verdure o'er a lonely glade,"
3500,A POEM.,A fountain with eternal murmurs play'd:
3501,A POEM.,"Hard by, an ancient forest's leafy brow"
3502,A POEM.,"Cast a brown horror o'er the stream below,"
3503,A POEM.,"On the green margin of the quiet flood,"
3504,A POEM.,"With looks of woe, a time-worn Exile stood:"
3505,A POEM.,"On the dim wave he cast a gloomy look,"
3506,A POEM.,Then thus in low and troubled accents spoke:
3507,A POEM.,
3508,A POEM.,"""Dear native stream! and thou, thrice happy lawn!"
3509,A POEM.,"Where once I roved, in youth's first joyous dawn,"
3510,A POEM.,"While every wind a holy silence kept,"
3511,A POEM.,And peaceful on the flood the sunbeam slept:

3529,A POEM.,"Oft as I trod the meadow's verdant round,"

3531,A POEM.,"Or traced the willowy margin of the stream,"
3532,A POEM.,"Lost in the wildering maze of Fancy's dream,"
3533,A POEM.,"Before me Life's long years in prospect rose,"
3534,A POEM.,"By fears unbroken, undisturb'd by woes."

3536,A POEM.,Feels those bright hours not yet effaced by pain:
3537,A POEM.,"Still on my soul they cast a distant light,"
3538,A POEM.,And gild with transitory gleams the night!
3539,A POEM.,
3540,A POEM.,"""Yet then, ev'n then, the powers of fate below"
3541,A POEM.,Prepared for me their gather'd stores of woe:
3542,A POEM.,"The tempest watch'd to blot my peaceful day,"
3543,A POEM.,And silent in their beds the thunders lay!
3544,A POEM.,
3545,A POEM.,"""Short was my date of joy: the yawning tomb"
3546,A POEM.,Snatch'd my loved parents to eternal gloom.
3547,A POEM.,With fearful awe my shuddering soul survey'd
3548,A POEM.,"The untried path of misery display'd,"
3549,A POEM.,"Gazed wild upon Misfortune's unknown form,"
3550,A POEM.,And watch'd the coming terrors of the storm.
3551,A POEM.,
3552,A POEM.,"""Soon burst the cloud, and far away was borne"
3553,A POEM.,The last faint gleam of Life's deceitful morn.
3554,A POEM.,"For fancied crimes expell'd my native shore,"
3555,A POEM.,"And doom'd alone to measure ocean o'er,"
3556,A POEM.,"I left those scenes where joy for ever reigns,"
3557,A POEM.,Secure to find her on no other plains.
3558,A POEM.,
3559,A POEM.,"""Dark rose the morn: the wind in every wood"
3560,A POEM.,"Howl'd, and the meteors glancing o'er the flood"
3561,A POEM.,Flash'd a portentous light. Before the gale
3562,A POEM.,With streaming eyes I spread my little sail:
3563,A POEM.,"Swift o'er the sounding waves the vessel flew,"
3564,A POEM.,Cliff after cliff receding from my view:
3565,A POEM.,"Chill ran my heart--the swelling sails I furl'd,"
3566,A POEM.,While yet emerging from the watery world
3567,A POEM.,One headland rose--O'er all the boundless main. }
3568,A POEM.,I cast my shuddering view--I wept in vain--     }
3569,A POEM.,I wrung my hands in agonizing pain:             }
3570,A POEM.,"O'er my dim eyes increasing darkness hung,"
3571,A POEM.,"No low, faint murmurs, trembled on my tongue,"
3572,A POEM.,"A deadly torpor every limb oppress'd,"
3573,A POEM.,"Weak were my sinews, and unmann'd my breast:"
3574,A POEM.,"When lo! a voice, that struck my inmost heart,"
3575,A POEM.,"Seem'd, thro' the wavering storm, to cry, 'Depart!'"
3576,A POEM.,"Trembling with awe, I turn'd my aching view,"
3577,A POEM.,"And spread the flying sail, and o'er the billows flew."
3578,A POEM.,
3579,A POEM.,"""On foreign shores, to poverty resign'd,"
3580,A POEM.,"An exile, friendless and alone, I pined."
3581,A POEM.,Hope and Content inspired my toils no more;
3582,A POEM.,Alas! I left them on my native shore!
3583,A POEM.,"Stern Want around me pour'd her chilling woes,"
3584,A POEM.,"And no faint beam, to cheer my winter, rose."
3585,A POEM.,
3586,A POEM.,"""At length, when years, with slow-revolving round,"
3587,A POEM.,"Had half assuaged my soul's eternal wound,"
3588,A POEM.,And rural peace my humble efforts bless'd
3589,A POEM.,With one short calm of momentary rest;
3590,A POEM.,"Sudden, the demons of tyrannic war             }"
3591,A POEM.,"Whirl thro' our peaceful haunts his rapid car, }"
3592,A POEM.,And waving standards kindle all the air:       }
3593,A POEM.,"In crackling heaps the flaming forests rise,"
3594,A POEM.,The smoking cities darken half the skies.
3595,A POEM.,"Thro' burning woods and falling towers I sprung,"
3596,A POEM.,"While torches hiss'd, and darts around me sung,"
3597,A POEM.,"And, still expectant of some happier time,"
3598,A POEM.,Sought distant refuge in another clime.
3599,A POEM.,
3600,A POEM.,"""My term of sorrows came not: black Despair,"
3601,A POEM.,"And lawless Force, and shrinking Fear, were there."
3602,A POEM.,"Woes, yet unfelt, were nigh;--fell Slavery shed"
3603,A POEM.,Her night of sorrows on my hapless head:
3604,A POEM.,"Doom'd each imperious order to fulfil,"
3605,A POEM.,And watch a ruthless master's various will.
3606,A POEM.,"Five years, exposed to unremitted pain,"
3607,A POEM.,I languish'd there--'till Friendship broke my chain.
3608,A POEM.,
3609,A POEM.,"""Now o'er my head full fifteen suns had burn'd,    }"
3610,A POEM.,Since from my native rocks my eyes I turn'd:         }
3611,A POEM.,"And practised now in woe, my soul no longer mourn'd. }"
3612,A POEM.,"I sought my patron, and (a bark supplied)"
3613,A POEM.,His fortunes follow'd o'er the foamy tide.
3614,A POEM.,
3615,A POEM.,"""From these dire shores our rapid course we held;"
3616,A POEM.,Auspicious gales the flying canvas swell'd;
3617,A POEM.,"And joy's faint sunshine kindled in my eyes,"
3618,A POEM.,As the last mountain mingled with the skies:
3619,A POEM.,"When, by conflicting winds together driven,"
3620,A POEM.,A night of clouds involved the starless heaven;
3621,A POEM.,"Fierce and more fierce th' increasing tempest blew,"
3622,A POEM.,"The thunder rattled, and the lightning flew."
3623,A POEM.,"Soon, borne at random o'er the watery way,"
3624,A POEM.,The yawning rocks our guideless ship betray;
3625,A POEM.,My shrieking comrades sink.--Some power unseen
3626,A POEM.,"Preserved me, trembling, thro' the deathful scene;"
3627,A POEM.,"I rode th' opposing waves, and from the steep"
3628,A POEM.,Beheld the vessel plunge into the flashing deep.
3629,A POEM.,
3630,A POEM.,"""Beneath a sheltering wood all night I lay,"
3631,A POEM.,'Till morn had chased the flying stars away;
3632,A POEM.,Then sought the wave-worn strand.--The storm was dead;
3633,A POEM.,And Silence o'er the deep her pinions spread.
3634,A POEM.,All--all were gone!--I saw my doom severe;
3635,A POEM.,"And, dull with suffering, scarcely dropp'd a tear!"
3636,A POEM.,
3637,A POEM.,"""There, by the murmurs of the sea's hoarse wave,"
3638,A POEM.,"Scorch'd on the rock, or shivering in the cave,"
3639,A POEM.,"Long, long I stay'd: Fate yet prolong'd my day,"
3640,A POEM.,And Grief and Famine spared their willing prey.
3641,A POEM.,"A roving bark at length approach'd, and bore"
3642,A POEM.,The suppliant stranger to fair India's shore.
3643,A POEM.,
3644,A POEM.,"""With wondering steps I traced the sunny strand,"
3645,A POEM.,And mark'd each giant work of nature's hand;
3646,A POEM.,"Saw towering oaks th' aÃ«rial tempest brave,"
3647,A POEM.,And mighty rivers roll the sea-like wave.
3648,A POEM.,"Amaze, unmix'd with joy, my soul possess'd;"
3649,A POEM.,What beauteous scene can charm an Exile's breast?
3650,A POEM.,"Sadly I saw primeval forests frown,"
3651,A POEM.,"And, in each foreign stream, still sought my own."
3652,A POEM.,
3653,A POEM.,"""No bright success my rising labours crown'd;"
3654,A POEM.,"The sunbeam wither'd, or the deluge drown'd,"
3655,A POEM.,"Each growing hope: my frame seem'd worn with care,"
3656,A POEM.,And Death still hover'd in the feverish air.
3657,A POEM.,Stern Famine o'er my solitary gate
3658,A POEM.,"Spread her cold wings, and watch'd in sullen state."
3659,A POEM.,Life yet was dear--Each visionary night
3660,A POEM.,Restored my ancient dwelling to my sight;
3661,A POEM.,"And every gale, that swept the valley o'er,"
3662,A POEM.,Appear'd to point me to my native shore.
3663,A POEM.,
3664,A POEM.,"""Soon as the morning waved her banner red,"
3665,A POEM.,With bounding heart the winged sail I spread.
3666,A POEM.,"Again the tempest roars, the meteors play,"
3667,A POEM.,And struggling clouds repel the rising ray.
3668,A POEM.,Yet nought disturb'd my unprophetic soul;
3669,A POEM.,"Resign'd to joy, impatient of control,"
3670,A POEM.,I seem'd new-born: Creative Hope again
3671,A POEM.,"Restored the sense of pleasure, and of pain;"
3672,A POEM.,"Tumultuous transport, now no more suppressed,"
3673,A POEM.,"Shone from my eyes, and wanton'd in my breast."
3674,A POEM.,
3675,A POEM.,"""Soon did the storm subside: before the breeze"
3676,A POEM.,"Smooth flew the boat, across the summer seas."
3677,A POEM.,"The brightening sunbeam on the waters danced,"
3678,A POEM.,From the blue clouds a stream of radiance glanced.
3679,A POEM.,
3680,A POEM.,"""As the fleet swallow, eager to attain"
3681,A POEM.,"Her well-known regions, scuds o'er land and main;"
3682,A POEM.,"So, wing'd with hope, I flew: my eager sail"
3683,A POEM.,"Stemm'd many a sea, and waved in many a gale,"
3684,A POEM.,"While, ardent still one object to pursue,"
3685,A POEM.,"I shunn'd the rock, and thro' the tempest flew:"
3686,A POEM.,"And still, with rapture's mingled tear and smile,"
3687,A POEM.,"Mark'd, as it pass'd, each dim receding isle."
3688,A POEM.,"From each fair view my swimming eyes declined,"
3689,A POEM.,And fairer views rose imaged in my mind.
3690,A POEM.,
3691,A POEM.,"""Swift o'er the waves I flew; and many a day"
3692,A POEM.,"On the smooth wings of joy had roll'd away,"
3693,A POEM.,"When, half-discover'd 'mid the clouds of night,"
3694,A POEM.,My native cliffs rose beauteous to my sight.
3695,A POEM.,"With beating heart I furl my sail, and sweep"
3696,A POEM.,With rapid oar the smooth-dividing deep.
3697,A POEM.,"The well-known bay a ready entrance gave,"
3698,A POEM.,And safe return'd me from the stormy wave.
3699,A POEM.,
3700,A POEM.,"""Now Night, advancing up th'etherial plain,"
3701,A POEM.,Drew slowly her broad veil o'er land and main.
3702,A POEM.,"With falling tears I bathed the sacred ground,"
3703,A POEM.,And thro' the viewless darkness gazed around:
3704,A POEM.,But air's blank waste deceived my ardent sight;
3705,A POEM.,"The hills were dark, the rivers roll'd in night."
3706,A POEM.,"Yet swift imagination, uncontroll'd,"
3707,A POEM.,"Ranged o'er the scene, and tinged it all with gold."
3708,A POEM.,"'And here,' I cried, 'amid this piny grove,"
3709,A POEM.,In winter's morn my lonely steps shall rove;
3710,A POEM.,"And there, beneath yon' poplar's silver shade,"
3711,A POEM.,At summer noon my weary limbs be laid.
3712,A POEM.,"Yon azure stream, that parts the fruitful scene,"
3713,A POEM.,"Shall see my cottage on its banks of green,"
3714,A POEM.,"Long-cherish'd friends shall charm each livelong day,"
3715,A POEM.,"And jocund children, more beloved than they:"
3716,A POEM.,"My sun thro' ambient clouds shall set more fair,"
3717,A POEM.,And thirty years of grief be lost in air.
3718,A POEM.,"Oh, happy long-lost land! once more receive"
3719,A POEM.,"Thy time-worn Exile, and his cares relieve!'"
3720,A POEM.,
3721,A POEM.,"""The gathered mists roll'd slowly from the lawn,"
3722,A POEM.,And fading stars announced the silent dawn:
3723,A POEM.,"A hill, that tower'd above the bounded heath,"
3724,A POEM.,"I climb'd, and gazed upon the scene beneath."
3725,A POEM.,The beams of morning woke no living eye
3726,A POEM.,Amid this vast and cheerless vacancy:
3727,A POEM.,They only pour'd their ineffectual light
3728,A POEM.,"On a bleak prospect, better hid in night!"
3729,A POEM.,"Where'er I look'd, outstretch'd in long survey,"
3730,A POEM.,A huge unmeasured waste of ruins lay.
3731,A POEM.,"War's fiery steps had mark'd the beauteous scene,"
3732,A POEM.,"And mingled ravage show'd where death had been,"
3733,A POEM.,"The fallen cottage, and the mouldering tower--"
3734,A POEM.,A dreary monument of wrathful power!
3735,A POEM.,"The stream that once, diffused in lucid pride,"
3736,A POEM.,"Saw towers, and woods, and hamlets, on its side,"
3737,A POEM.,"Now choked with weeds, in mossy fragments lost,"
3738,A POEM.,Dragg'd a slow current o'er the mournful coast.
3739,A POEM.,"My friends, my foes, were fled--not one of all"
3740,A POEM.,"Remain'd, to see his country's hapless fall!"
3741,A POEM.,"O'er the wild plain the useless zephyrs blow,"
3742,A POEM.,And wasted suns unprofitably glow.
3743,A POEM.,This ancient forest now remain'd alone:--
3744,A POEM.,Beneath its shade I sat me down to moan;
3745,A POEM.,"Resign'd to dumb despair, without a tear,          }"
3746,A POEM.,"Prostrate I lay, or slowly wander'd, here,         }"
3747,A POEM.,"And, wandering, thought upon the things that were: }"
3748,A POEM.,"'Till crowding thoughts a sudden lustre flung,"
3749,A POEM.,And my wild heart with desperate hope was strung.
3750,A POEM.,
3751,A POEM.,"""Hence, vain regrets! unmanly tears, away!"
3752,A POEM.,'Tis time to close my melancholy day.
3753,A POEM.,"Smiling with peace, or brilliant with delight,"
3754,A POEM.,Eternity lies open to my sight.
3755,A POEM.,"I go, a fearless soul, unstain'd by crimes,"
3756,A POEM.,To seek the rest denied in earthly climes.
3757,A POEM.,
3758,A POEM.,"""Ye righteous Powers, whoe'er ye are, who guide"
3759,A POEM.,"Earth's changeful tumult, and its cares divide;"
3760,A POEM.,"Who rule mankind with absolute decree,"
3761,A POEM.,"And grace the bless'd with good, unknown to me:"
3762,A POEM.,To you I pray not: Your afflicting hand         }
3763,A POEM.,Has given the sign to quit this earthly strand: }
3764,A POEM.,I bow with joy to your implied command!         }
3765,A POEM.,Yes--in the bosom of eternal fate
3766,A POEM.,"Some real joys, perhaps, my soul await:"
3767,A POEM.,"Some peace may yet be mine--some powerful rock,"
3768,A POEM.,"Unmoved by terror, or misfortune's shock;"
3769,A POEM.,"Some vale of calmness, some sequester'd shore,"
3770,A POEM.,"Where hope, and fear, and sorrow, are no more."
3771,A POEM.,
3772,A POEM.,"""My soul, thro' endless ages doom'd to live,"
3773,A POEM.,"A quenchless flame, must every sphere survive:"
3774,A POEM.,"Whence, then, these sorrows in her mortal times;"
3775,A POEM.,"Chain'd down to woe, ere yet involved in crimes?"
3776,A POEM.,"This cloud unpierced, that darkens all her way?"
3777,A POEM.,Is this the dawn of an eternal day?--

3781,A POEM.,He spoke; and gazing on the watery grave.
3782,A POEM.,"Approach'd with tranquil step the fatal wave,"
3783,A POEM.,"Where the green verge with easy slope descends,"
3784,A POEM.,"And, rippling on the sand, the water ends."
3785,A POEM.,"When lo! some power, with deep resistless force,"
3786,A POEM.,"Check'd his firm soul, and stopp'd his fearless course;"
3787,A POEM.,"He felt its languid influence thro' his breast,"
3788,A POEM.,"And, stretch'd in sleep, the grassy margin press'd;"
3789,A POEM.,"His weary soul to balmy rest resign'd,"
3790,A POEM.,And fancy bore these visions to his mind.
3791,A POEM.,
3792,A POEM.,"On a broad bank, alone, he seem'd to stand,"
3793,A POEM.,Whose flowery limit closed a spacious land.
3794,A POEM.,"Around, the cultured plains appeared to glow"
3795,A POEM.,With various hues: a river roll'd below:
3796,A POEM.,"Unvex'd by storms, the tranquil waters ran:"
3797,A POEM.,On heaven's blue verge calm shines the mounting sun.
3798,A POEM.,"As waken'd from a dream of woe, amazed,"
3799,A POEM.,"On woods, and skies, and murmuring streams, he gazed:"
3800,A POEM.,"Calm, silent raptures flow'd thro' all his breast,"
3801,A POEM.,And seem'd the foretaste of eternal rest.
3802,A POEM.,
3803,A POEM.,"His eye, now settled, mark'd a little boat,"
3804,A POEM.,Which on the nearest waves appear'd to float:
3805,A POEM.,Its airy sail with snow-white radiance blazed;
3806,A POEM.,"Its blue prow tinged the waters.--As he gazed,"
3807,A POEM.,"Lo! the clouds opened, and with sudden glare"
3808,A POEM.,A dazzling form descended thro' the air.
3809,A POEM.,"Swift as a sea-bird darting o'er the deep,"
3810,A POEM.,"Or meteor hovering with aÃ«rial sweep,"
3811,A POEM.,"He flew, and lighting radiant on the helm,"
3812,A POEM.,Cast a bright shadow o'er the watery realm.
3813,A POEM.,"He waved his hand; the Exile took the sign,"
3814,A POEM.,"Embark'd, and join'd the messenger divine."
3815,A POEM.,
3816,A POEM.,Smooth o'er the liquid plain the vessel steers;
3817,A POEM.,A faint-reflected sun on every wave appears.
3818,A POEM.,"Swift o'er the stream it steers: on either side,"
3819,A POEM.,In murmurs low th' advancing waves divide.
3820,A POEM.,"Thro' cloudless skies the radiant orb of day,"
3821,A POEM.,"Enthroned in light, held on his heavenly way;"
3822,A POEM.,"A line of light along the ocean streams,"
3823,A POEM.,The white sails glisten in the golden beams.
3824,A POEM.,"Still, as they roll, the river's waters lave"
3825,A POEM.,With ceaseless flow the lily of the wave:
3826,A POEM.,The willow-forests on its verdant side
3827,A POEM.,Bathe their green tresses in the crystal tide:
3828,A POEM.,"The bending alders paint the floods, and seem"
3829,A POEM.,A waving curtain o'er the glassy stream.
3830,A POEM.,Thro' the wide clouds and thro' the watery way
3831,A POEM.,Calm Light and Silence held their boundless sway.
3832,A POEM.,
3833,A POEM.,"Now vanish'd from their eyes the lessening shore,"
3834,A POEM.,And nearer grew the ocean's sullen roar:
3835,A POEM.,"And when the sun-heaven's topmost dome had scaled,"
3836,A POEM.,The green-tinged waters of the deep they sailed.
3837,A POEM.,"The orb of day, faint-glittering from afar,"
3838,A POEM.,Now veil'd in gradual gloom his beamy car:
3839,A POEM.,"A hollow murmur thro' the blackening skies,"
3840,A POEM.,"Rolls dismal on, and loudens as it flies:"
3841,A POEM.,"The watery birds fly screaming from the steep,"
3842,A POEM.,And darkness settles on the shivering deep.
3843,A POEM.,"The wondering Exile, from the deck, beheld"
3844,A POEM.,"The tempest grow, and clouds on clouds impell'd:"
3845,A POEM.,"Far to the south their dusky legions bend,"
3846,A POEM.,And thence o'er heaven a gloomy line extend.
3847,A POEM.,"He heard th' approaching tempest's hollow sigh,"
3848,A POEM.,And cold despondence trembled in his eye--
3849,A POEM.,"And lo, it bursts! the boundless whirlwinds sweep,"
3850,A POEM.,"Toss the light clouds, and tear the staggering deep"
3851,A POEM.,Sheer from its lowest caves--the smoking rain
3852,A POEM.,Bursts in white torrents o'er the echoing main:
3853,A POEM.,The fiery bolts uninterrupted roll
3854,A POEM.,"From sky to sky, and shake the stedfast pole:"
3855,A POEM.,Red volleying o'er the heavens with curving beam
3856,A POEM.,"The fitful lightnings dart a quivering gleam,"
3857,A POEM.,"And, glancing thro' the raven plumes of night,"
3858,A POEM.,Shed o'er the deep a pale sepulchral light.
3859,A POEM.,
3860,A POEM.,Swift to the Power unknown his eyes he rear'd--
3861,A POEM.,No sign of comfort in the Power appear'd:
3862,A POEM.,Silent he stood--when lo! another blast
3863,A POEM.,"Rends the strong sail, and shakes the tottering mast!"
3864,A POEM.,"Now, by the mounting billows upward swung,"
3865,A POEM.,Trembling amid the darksome sky they hung;
3866,A POEM.,"Now seem'd to touch the fountains of the deep,"
3867,A POEM.,Where in eternal rest the waters sleep.
3868,A POEM.,And now beneath a milder tempest's sway
3869,A POEM.,Onward the rapid vessel bounds away;
3870,A POEM.,"When, lo! again--as if with thundering fall"
3871,A POEM.,"Descended to the deep heaven's loosen'd wall,"
3872,A POEM.,"Yells the fierce storm: beneath the furious shock,"
3873,A POEM.,"Torn from its roots, the long-resisting rock"
3874,A POEM.,"Falls prone; the sands, driven by the whirling sweep,"
3875,A POEM.,"Boil up, and darken the discolour'd deep."
3876,A POEM.,
3877,A POEM.,"Still o'er the stormy waste they labour on,"
3878,A POEM.,Thro' bowling deserts and thro' paths unknown--
3879,A POEM.,"A long, long way! the lightnings flame around,"
3880,A POEM.,And winds and billows mix their mournful sound.
3881,A POEM.,Still on they fare--'till thro' the ambient night
3882,A POEM.,Bursts a third whirlwind with redoubled might;
3883,A POEM.,The congregated clouds in one vast sweep
3884,A POEM.,"It drives, and bares the bosom of the deep."
3885,A POEM.,"The sail flies loose, the mast in fragments torn"
3886,A POEM.,O'er the black surface of the waves is borne
3887,A POEM.,"Louder, and longer, over heaven's wide field"
3888,A POEM.,Thro' the rent clouds the bellowing thunders peal'd:
3889,A POEM.,In one blue sheet the streamy lightnings glare;
3890,A POEM.,"A thousand demons ride the flaming air,"
3891,A POEM.,"O'er the dark waves a deeper horror cast,"
3892,A POEM.,And howl between the pauses of the blast.
3893,A POEM.,And now 'twas silence all--a sulphurous smell
3894,A POEM.,Spread round: a cloud arose with sudden swell;
3895,A POEM.,"Slow o'er the ocean's trembling waves it past,"
3896,A POEM.,"And from its bosom, indistinct and vast,"
3897,A POEM.,A giant form advanced across the gloom
3898,A POEM.,"Of air, and pointed to the watery tomb."
3899,A POEM.,
3900,A POEM.,"Shuddering with fear, he turn'd.--His guide was gone;"
3901,A POEM.,A broad chaotic cloud appear'd alone.
3902,A POEM.,"His limbs no more their chilly weight sustained,"
3903,A POEM.,"A deathlike torpor o'er his bosom reign'd,"
3904,A POEM.,His stony eyeballs fix'd in silent trance
3905,A POEM.,Met the terrific Spectre's withering glance.
3906,A POEM.,"And lo! the Phantom waves, with sudden glare,"
3907,A POEM.,His burning sceptre thro' the starless air!
3908,A POEM.,"High o'er the bark the booming billows spread,"
3909,A POEM.,The deafening waves were closing o'er his head;
3910,A POEM.,"When rushing clouds the towering form involved,"
3911,A POEM.,And all the vision into air dissolved.
3912,A POEM.,"Like mist that flits before the solar car,"
3913,A POEM.,"Or the wan splendours of a falling star,"
3914,A POEM.,"The scene dispers'd; and at his side, return'd,"
3915,A POEM.,The heavenly Guide in all his radiance burn'd.
3916,A POEM.,
3917,A POEM.,"A smile, with love and calm affection fraught,"
3918,A POEM.,"The Seraph gave, as by the hand he caught"
3919,A POEM.,"Th' admiring Exile: then the earth forsook,"
3920,A POEM.,And thro' dividing clouds his easy journey took.
3921,A POEM.,
3922,A POEM.,"Above the skies on silent wings upborne,"
3923,A POEM.,"They seek the quarter of the rising morn,"
3924,A POEM.,"And, wheeling thro' the stars their level flight,"
3925,A POEM.,On a tall mountain's cloudless top alight.
3926,A POEM.,
3927,A POEM.,"Beneath, a boundless realm in prospect lay;"
3928,A POEM.,Fair as the regions of perpetual day
3929,A POEM.,Wide stretch'd the peaceful vale. A brighter sun
3930,A POEM.,"Thro' purer skies his azure course begun,"
3931,A POEM.,"And, uneclips'd, along th' etherial road"
3932,A POEM.,A host of stars with rival splendours glow'd.
3933,A POEM.,"Far to the west, with dewy spangles gay,"
3934,A POEM.,Long tracts of meads reflect the orient ray;
3935,A POEM.,"Collected fragrance breathes in every gale,"
3936,A POEM.,And harvests nod on every yellow dale.
3937,A POEM.,The southern plain a lordly city crown'd:
3938,A POEM.,Its ample range with marble turrets frown'd.
3939,A POEM.,The golden spires with pointed radiance glow'd;
3940,A POEM.,From tower to tower the pure effulgence flow'd.
3941,A POEM.,"The lofty gates for ever open stood,"
3942,A POEM.,And o'er the region pour'd a living flood.
3943,A POEM.,"Their dusky sides by piny groves conceal'd,"
3944,A POEM.,A range of snow-capp'd hills the north reveal'd:
3945,A POEM.,Amidst the dark-brow'd woods with murmurs hoarse
3946,A POEM.,A thousand torrents took their foamy course.
3947,A POEM.,The eastern limit show'd a spacious bay;
3948,A POEM.,Blue Ocean redden'd in the morning ray:
3949,A POEM.,"Reflected lustre crown'd the chalky steep,"
3950,A POEM.,And stately navies darkened half the deep.
3951,A POEM.,"From the tall hill, beneath the sunny beam,"
3952,A POEM.,"Three rivers, issuing, pour a various stream,"
3953,A POEM.,"Now thro' the lawns in parted currents glide,"
3954,A POEM.,"And now, uniting, spread an equal tide."
3955,A POEM.,"Unnumber'd tints the forest-boughs unfold,"
3956,A POEM.,And the bright waters seem to roll in gold.
3957,A POEM.,
3958,A POEM.,Successive wonders on the Exile's breast
3959,A POEM.,A visionary strange amaze impress'd;
3960,A POEM.,"New hopes, new fears, his trembling bosom throng,"
3961,A POEM.,"Doubt follows doubt, and thought drives thought along."
3962,A POEM.,"When now the Angel, with that awful grace,"
3963,A POEM.,"That waits on spirits of celestial race,"
3964,A POEM.,"On the pale mortal lost in dark surprize,"
3965,A POEM.,Fix'd the keen radiance of his sun-like eyes:
3966,A POEM.,"Mild were his looks: yet, when his accents flow'd,"
3967,A POEM.,It seem'd as thunder shook the bursting cloud.
3968,A POEM.,
3969,A POEM.,"""Beneath the weight of earthly evil bent,"
3970,A POEM.,In varied toils and woes thy days were spent;
3971,A POEM.,"'Till cold Misfortune, with unceasing lower,"
3972,A POEM.,"Weigh'd down thy soul, and deaden'd every power,"
3973,A POEM.,"Reflection's lamp withdrew her guiding ray,"
3974,A POEM.,"And fail'd to point thee on thy darkling way,"
3975,A POEM.,And thy wild soul prepared to launch alone
3976,A POEM.,From Night's dark bosom into worlds unknown:
3977,A POEM.,"When, sent by Heaven thy earthly deeds to guide,"
3978,A POEM.,"And o'er thy term of varied life preside,"

3989,A POEM.,No artful foe has doom'd thy humble name
3990,A POEM.,"To public enmity, or public shame;"
3991,A POEM.,"And last, and worst of all, the pangs of woe"
3992,A POEM.,"Hell can inflict, or vengeful Heaven bestow,"
3993,A POEM.,Relentless Conscience has not shed on thee
3994,A POEM.,"Her poison'd darts,--her stings of misery!"
3995,A POEM.,"Thy virtue shone thro' the dim vale of earth,"
3996,A POEM.,And toils and dangers proved thy blameless worth.
3997,A POEM.,"For this, my hand its timely aid bestow'd"
3998,A POEM.,To draw thee back from error's devious road.
3999,A POEM.,
4000,A POEM.,"""All, all are equal: Heaven's impartial mind"
4001,A POEM.,"One bliss, one woe allots to all mankind:"
4002,A POEM.,"And he whose morn seem'd wrapp'd in cloudy night,"
4003,A POEM.,Shall see his evening glow with placid light.
4004,A POEM.,Thro' calm prosperity's serenest sky
4005,A POEM.,The approaching gales of adverse fortune sigh;
4006,A POEM.,"And when Affliction whets her keenest dart,"
4007,A POEM.,"And hurls it, flaming, at the shrinking heart,"
4008,A POEM.,"Celestial Hope with golden wing attends,"
4009,A POEM.,"Heals every wound, and every toil befriends:"
4010,A POEM.,The horrors vanish; gleams of light divine
4011,A POEM.,"Illume the cloud, and thro' its openings shine;"
4012,A POEM.,"As the bow, herald of ethereal peace,"
4013,A POEM.,"Smiles thro' the storm, and makes the tempest please."
4014,A POEM.,
4015,A POEM.,"""To sway the whirlwind, gathering clouds control,"
4016,A POEM.,"Arrest the sun, or shake with storms the pole,"
4017,A POEM.,Heaven gives to none:--nor have the mightiest power
4018,A POEM.,To stop the current of one changeful hour:
4019,A POEM.,"Resistless Fate with even course proceeds,"
4020,A POEM.,And o'er their levell'd pomp her thundering chariot leads.
4021,A POEM.,But all can solace their afflicted mind
4022,A POEM.,"With temperate wishes, and a will resign'd,"
4023,A POEM.,"Can cheer the sad, improve the prosperous hour,"
4024,A POEM.,"With meek Humility, and Virtue's power:"
4025,A POEM.,"With these, terrestrial pleasures never cloy,"
4026,A POEM.,"And fear is lost in peace, and sorrow turns to joy."
4027,A POEM.,
4028,A POEM.,"""Yet oft' the brave resisting soul, like thee,"
4029,A POEM.,"At random borne across Life's wintery sea,"
4030,A POEM.,"When various tempests, with successive force,"
4031,A POEM.,"Still drive her devious from her destined course,"
4032,A POEM.,"With labour worn, at last the helm resigns,"
4033,A POEM.,And in deep anguish at her lot repines;
4034,A POEM.,"Despair throws round impenetrable gloom,"
4035,A POEM.,And Death invites her to the ready tomb.
4036,A POEM.,
4037,A POEM.,"""Let faithful Memory tell (for Memory can)"
4038,A POEM.,How thy first years in even current ran;

4040,A POEM.,To feast with countless sweets thy tranquil mind:
4041,A POEM.,"Each passing joy a kindred joy pursued,"
4042,A POEM.,Nor ask'd the aid of sad vicissitude.
4043,A POEM.,"Swift flew thy boat, thro' isles with verdure crown'd,"
4044,A POEM.,"Heaven's smile above, and prosperous seas around:"
4045,A POEM.,"O'er the smooth waves Hope's cheering zephyr pass'd,"

4053,A POEM.,And panting Hope look'd forward to the close.
4054,A POEM.,
4055,A POEM.,"""As vapours, slowly thickening, blot away,"
4056,A POEM.,"Beam after beam, the sacred orb of day;"
4057,A POEM.,So woes on woes in long continuance blind

4059,A POEM.,"'Till, by some sudden gust of misery cross'd,"
4060,A POEM.,"On the mad ocean of despondence toss'd,"
4061,A POEM.,"Reason herself, once bold, acute, and strong,"
4062,A POEM.,No more discerns the bounds of right and wrong:
4063,A POEM.,"Lost, in the mist of fear, her Heavenly Guide,"
4064,A POEM.,"She deems all efforts vain, and sinks beneath the tide."
4065,A POEM.,
4066,A POEM.,"""But shrink not thou from earth's malignant power!"
4067,A POEM.,Hope builds on high an everlasting tower;
4068,A POEM.,"And strength divine supports the suffering good,"

4077,A POEM.,"A light, unbought by all the joys of Sin,"
4078,A POEM.,"Cheers his wide soul, and brightens all within:"
4079,A POEM.,"And, though mankind his pious peace molest,"
4080,A POEM.,And mock the sigh that struggles half suppress'd;
4081,A POEM.,"Tho', leagued with man, the hostile powers of hell"
4082,A POEM.,Bid round his head the maddening tempest swell;
4083,A POEM.,"For ever fix'd on worlds beyond the pole,"
4084,A POEM.,Nought else can move his heaven-directed soul.
4085,A POEM.,'Tis his with tearless fortitude to feel
4086,A POEM.,The bigot fury of a tyrant's steel;
4087,A POEM.,'Tis his with cool untempted eye to gaze
4088,A POEM.,"On Wealth's bright pomp, and Beauty's brighter blaze:"

4846,BOOK THE FIRST.,
4847,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Steen Sture, PoeticÃ¨ Stenon, was the son of Suante Sture, administrator"
4848,BOOK THE FIRST.,"of Sweden, who reduced John the Second of Denmark to conclude a treaty"
4849,BOOK THE FIRST.,"with him, and who is greatly extolled by historians for the"
4850,BOOK THE FIRST.,"extraordinary spirit, skill, and moderation, with which he governed a"
4851,BOOK THE FIRST.,"turbulent kingdom for many years. Sture, though a young man, was"
4852,BOOK THE FIRST.,"admitted his successor, being duly elected on the 21st of July, 1513,"
4853,BOOK THE FIRST.,"after a violent struggle with his competitor, Eric Trolle, the senator,"
4854,BOOK THE FIRST.,"which laid the foundation of the enmity between him and Gustavus Trolle,"
4855,BOOK THE FIRST.,"the famous Primate of Sweden. On that prelate's arrival from Rome,"
4856,BOOK THE FIRST.,"however, he welcomed him to his see, and behaved to him in the most"
4857,BOOK THE FIRST.,courteous manner. This behaviour was repaid by Trolle with almost open
4858,BOOK THE FIRST.,hostility; but the young administrator had spirit enough to resist his
4859,BOOK THE FIRST.,"encroachments. Arcemboldi, the Pope's Legate, and merchant of"
4860,BOOK THE FIRST.,"indulgences, when passing through Sweden, in execution of his gainful"
4861,BOOK THE FIRST.,"office, was well received by Sture, who encouraged him in his exactions,"
4862,BOOK THE FIRST.,"from a political motive, and even exempted him from the duty which"
4863,BOOK THE FIRST.,former venders of indulgences had been accustomed to pay to the Kings
4864,BOOK THE FIRST.,and Governors of Sweden. In the war commenced by Christiern the Second
4865,BOOK THE FIRST.,"against Sweden, he signalized his courage and military talents on many"
4866,BOOK THE FIRST.,"occasions, and was killed in an engagement with Otho Crumpein's army,"

4869,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Inferior to his father as an Administrator, he appears to have equalled"

4872,BOOK THE FIRST.,"of the French writer, was ""fitter to command a party, than govern an"

4879,BOOK THE FIRST.,
4880,BOOK THE FIRST.,Christiern the Second was perhaps the worst king that ever disgraced the
4881,BOOK THE FIRST.,Danish throne. It is difficult to find any thing estimable or admirable
4882,BOOK THE FIRST.,"in his character; he had neither the moderation of a Pisistratus, the"
4883,BOOK THE FIRST.,"talents of a CÃ¦sar, nor the political prudence of an Augustus. He"
4884,BOOK THE FIRST.,"succeeded his father John in 1512, and declared war against Sweden, in"
4885,BOOK THE FIRST.,"which he was assisted by Trolle. Having made a descent on the coast, he"
4886,BOOK THE FIRST.,"was repulsed by Steen Sture, and reduced to extremities. Wishing to"
4887,BOOK THE FIRST.,"treat with Sture, he demanded hostages for his safety; some of the"
4888,BOOK THE FIRST.,"principal nobles were sent to him in that quality, and among them"
4889,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Gustavus Vasa. With these he immediately sailed away, and on his return,"
4890,BOOK THE FIRST.,"confined them in the castle of Copenhagen, excepting Gustavus, who was"
4891,BOOK THE FIRST.,committed to the custody of Eric Banner. He made a second attack upon
4892,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Sweden, and, after the death of Steen Sture, was crowned King of Sweden."
4893,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Under false pretences, he put to death the whole Swedish senate, and"
4894,BOOK THE FIRST.,exercised innumerable barbarities on the townsmen and peasants.
4895,BOOK THE FIRST.,"(Puffendorff, passim.) Being afterwards expelled from Denmark by his"
4896,BOOK THE FIRST.,"uncle Prince Frederick, and from Sweden by Gustavus Vasa, after many"
4897,BOOK THE FIRST.,"fruitless attempts to regain possession of either kingdom, he was at"
4898,BOOK THE FIRST.,"last seized by Frederick, August 2, 1532, and confined in the Castle of"
4899,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Coldinger, where he died some years after."

4913,BOOK THE FIRST.,
4914,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Gustavus Trolle, son of Eric the rival of Steen Sture, was sent when"
4915,BOOK THE FIRST.,young to Rome (where it is supposed he learned the art of political
4916,BOOK THE FIRST.,"finesse), and was there consecrated Archbishop of Upsal by Leo the"
4917,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Tenth. On his return to Sweden, he treated with great haughtiness Steen"
4918,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Sture, who came to congratulate him on his elevation. He joined in"
4919,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Christiern's attempts on Sweden, and, being convicted of treason by the"
4920,BOOK THE FIRST.,"assembled Swedish States, retired from his archiepiscopal throne to a"
4921,BOOK THE FIRST.,"monastery. On the successes of Christiern, however, he quitted his"
4922,BOOK THE FIRST.,"retirement, and, regardless of his oaths of abdication, resumed his"
4923,BOOK THE FIRST.,former office. His forcible deposition was one of the pretexts for the
4924,BOOK THE FIRST.,massacre of Stockholm. He opposed Gustavus Vasa in his patriotic
4925,BOOK THE FIRST.,"endeavours, and once circumvented the hero with a troop of Danes, so"
4926,BOOK THE FIRST.,"that he narrowly escaped with his life. Vasa, however, soon retorted the"
4927,BOOK THE FIRST.,same stratagem on his enemy; and he was at last obliged to retire into
4928,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Denmark, where he with difficulty escaped death from the resentment of"
4929,BOOK THE FIRST.,"his master. A wound, received in an engagement with the troops of"
4930,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Christiern the Third, terminated the existence of one of the most"
4931,BOOK THE FIRST.,"restless caballers, and most accomplished statesmen, of his time."

4962,BOOK THE FIRST.,"instigation of Steen Sture, he added his name to the rest, but secretly"
4963,BOOK THE FIRST.,"slipped under the seal a note, declaring his dissent: of this he"
4964,BOOK THE FIRST.,"informed Christiern, when under the edge of the axe. On Gustavus's"
4965,BOOK THE FIRST.,"insurrection, he at first remained neutral: afterwards, being besieged"
4966,BOOK THE FIRST.,"in his castle by Gustavus, he came over to him. But his invincible"
4967,BOOK THE FIRST.,obstinacy and factious disposition were a great obstacle to Gustavus in

5001,BOOK THE FIRST.,"rapacity, sent an immediate express to his master, who ordered him to"
5002,BOOK THE FIRST.,"assemble his army, and attack the insurgents. In conformity to these"

5097,BOOK THE SECOND.,"unpopularity, procure himself elected Administrator. He also concealed"
5098,BOOK THE SECOND.,many Swedish gentlemen from the rage of Christiern. He defeated the

5100,BOOK THE SECOND.,afterwards routed one of that hero's armies in Finland. But his fleet

5145,BOOK THE THIRD.,
5146,BOOK THE THIRD.,"Gustaf Wase, or Gustavus Vasa, was the son of Eric Vasa, governor of"
5147,BOOK THE THIRD.,"Halland, and was cousin-german to Steen Sture. Being the grand nephew of"
5148,BOOK THE THIRD.,"King Canutson, he was descended from the ancient kings of Sweden. Before"
5149,BOOK THE THIRD.,"his confinement by Christiern, he was one of the moving springs of the"
5150,BOOK THE THIRD.,"state; he assisted Sture with his counsels, which were bold and"
5151,BOOK THE THIRD.,"judicious, and gained a signal victory over the Danes. Christiern,"
5152,BOOK THE THIRD.,"receiving him as a hostage, caused him to be arrested and carried him to"
5153,BOOK THE THIRD.,"Denmark, where, by the request of Eric Banner, he was entrusted to the"
5154,BOOK THE THIRD.,"care of that nobleman. From his custody, however, he soon escaped, and"
5155,BOOK THE THIRD.,"traversed the various provinces of Sweden, in hopes of exciting at least"
5156,BOOK THE THIRD.,"some of them to assert their independence. His efforts, however,"
5157,BOOK THE THIRD.,"surprising and unwearied as they were, did not avail, 'till he arrived"
5158,BOOK THE THIRD.,in the remote province of Dalecarlia. His unexpected appearance there
5159,BOOK THE THIRD.,"among the peasants excited the whole province to revolt, and an army,"
5160,BOOK THE THIRD.,"assembled in haste, stormed the Governor's castle, and destroyed the"
5161,BOOK THE THIRD.,"greater part of the garrison. After this beginning, his successes"
5162,BOOK THE THIRD.,"gradually increased, and Angermanland, Helsingland, Gestricia, and other"
5163,BOOK THE THIRD.,governments almost immediately came over to his party. He sustained a
5164,BOOK THE THIRD.,war against the whole powers of Christiern for some years in a most
5165,BOOK THE THIRD.,"skilful and indefatigable manner, and succeeded at last in expelling"
5166,BOOK THE THIRD.,"Christiern, Trolle, and Norbi, from the land of which he was now elected"
5167,BOOK THE THIRD.,"monarch. A task, scarcely less difficult, remained--to extirpate the"
5168,BOOK THE THIRD.,"Catholic religion from Sweden. This he effected, and established"
5169,BOOK THE THIRD.,"Lutheranism on so firm a basis, that it has resisted all attempts to"
5170,BOOK THE THIRD.,"shake it. After a long and really glorious reign, he was succeeded by"
5171,BOOK THE THIRD.,"his son Eric the Fourteenth, in 1560. In him were combined all the"
5172,BOOK THE THIRD.,"qualities necessary to constitute a hero; he was enterprising, vigilant,"
5173,BOOK THE THIRD.,"proof against pleasures, brave, prudent, and generous. He erected Sweden"
5174,BOOK THE THIRD.,"to a degree of power and respectability unknown before, and laid the"
5175,BOOK THE THIRD.,foundation for the victories of Gustavus Adolphus and Charles the
5176,BOOK THE THIRD.,"Twelfth. For the particular events of his life and reign, see Vertot,"
